Translator: 549690339

What she saw in Zhou Xiang was weakness.

“Old Mrs. Cen knew that Zhou Xiang did not want to deal with this, so she directly took Zhou Xiang’s hand. “Xiang Xiang, let’s Go!” ”

“Okay.”Zhou Xiang nodded.

Duanmu Feng looked at Old Mrs. Cen and Zhou Xiang’s back and narrowed his eyes.

The group came to the headquarters.

Cen Haifeng dismissed all the servants.

“For a time, only the CEN family was left in the hall. ”

“Cen Haifeng knelt down in front of old Mrs. Cen. “Mom, I’m sorry.” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen sat on the chair and looked at Cen Haifeng. “Let me ask you, have you really forgotten about us?” ”

“”It’s true,”Cen Haifeng continued. “One day, I suddenly woke up. I don’t know who I am, I don’t remember what happened in the past, and I don’t know where I am. It was the national advisor and the Great Elder who told me that my name was Cen Haifeng. I was born in the General Alliance, and everything that happened after that was according to their plan. One day, I suddenly felt a headache coming on, and fragments flashed through my mind. Only then did I realize that something was wrong. So, I set off for the northwestern region, wanting to remove the forbidden spell on my body, but the answer I got was that I wasn’t affected by the forbidden spell. At that time, I was disheartened. Fortunately, I met Shaoqing and Miss Ye... :. “...” ” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Hearing his name from Cen Haifeng, Cen Shaoqing took a step forward and said slowly, “Grandma, he was indeed hit by a forbidden spell.” ”

Old Madam Cen looked at Ye Zhuo.

“Ye Zhuo said, “Yes, Grandma Cen. Everything Uncle told Shaoqing was true.” ”

Ye Zhuo was the one who had personally solved the forbidden spell. This matter could not be faked.

“After saying that, CEN Haifeng continued, “After learning the truth, the first thing I wanted to do was to apologize to you. However, I was afraid that you would not forgive me for not wanting to see me, so I found Miss Ye.” ”

“Cen Haifeng also did not wish for things to turn out like this. He felt like he had a dream. After waking up from the dream, the situation had turned into an uncontrollable situation. ”

He had never thought of letting Zhou Xiang down...

“However, no matter how unwilling he was, these things had already happened. ”

“”Mom, I’m sorry. Please give me a chance to change.” ”

Old Mrs. Cen closed her eyes and did not speak.

It was said that those who did not know were innocent.

“Although she knew that this was not entirely CEN Haifeng’s fault, she could not forgive Cen Haifeng. ”

“In the past twenty years, she had seen with her own eyes how much Zhou Xiang had suffered and how much the children had suffered. ”

“If Cen Shaoqing had not stood up in time, the fate of the Cen family would not have been too good! ”

“At that time, everyone would push down the wall. ”

Their Cen family was old and young...

Cen Haifeng’s words could not erase the pain.

“Cen Haifeng turned to look at Zhou Xiang, “Xiangxiang, I know it’s useless to say anything now, but please believe me, I have never betrayed our love. Whether in the past or now, my heart has always been only you, also do not know how things become like this... . .” ”

Zhou Xiang also did not know how to face Cen Haifeng.

“The broken mirror is difficult to reunite, 20 years passed, Cen Haifeng’s side also has other people, they can not go back to the past. ”

“”You get up,”Zhou Xiang continued. “We will still be family.” ”

They were only family.

“Xiang Xiang...”Cen Haifeng’s eyes were filled with pain.

“When he was young, his greatest wish was to be able to grow old together with Zhou Xiang. ”

“He did not expect that after going through many twists and turns, they would actually become family in the end. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen said, “Getting you up is already giving you face! From the looks of it, do you not understand human language?” ”

Cen Haifeng stood up from the ground.

“After figuring out the relationship between her and Cen Haifeng, Zhou Xiang felt much more relaxed. She continued, “Do you still know the children?” ”

Cen Haifeng looked at his three daughters at the side and walked over. “This is the eldest girl.”

Cen Yuying nodded. “Dad.”

“This is the second girl.”Cen Haifeng walked over to Cen Yueya.

“Dad.”

“This is the third girl.”

“Cen yueying found it hard to forgive Cen Haifeng, but when she thought about it, it wasn’t all Cen Haifeng’s fault. After all, he had lost all his memories before, so he felt better. “Dad.” ”

“Cen Haifeng’s eyes were very red. He continued, “Why don’t I see the fourth girl? Where did the fourth girl go?” ”

“”The fourth girl is abroad now,”Cen Yuying answered. ”

“Ever since Cen Yuyan left the capital, she had not contacted her family. ”

“Cen Haifeng nodded and asked, “Is she doing well abroad?” ”
