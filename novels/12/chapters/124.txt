Chapter 125: 079: confirm the date of return, Strange Bite Marks 4

You must get first place in every exam.

If you don’t get first place, you will be subjected to cold violence and corporal punishment by Feng Xianxian.

Fortunately, Feng Xianxian herself did well and never let Feng Qianhua down.

Soon, the car arrived at the destination.

This was a hotel in Beijing.

Feng Xianxian was stunned again.

Didn’t they say they were going to the Lin Family?

Feng Xianxian looked at Feng Qianhua. “Mom, did we come to the wrong place?”

Feng Qianhua continued, “Your grandma Lin has something on today, so we won’t be going to her house for the New Year.”

“OH.”Feng Xianxian was very disappointed, but she didn’t ask further.

Yun Jing.

This year’s ye family was very lively. The television in the living room was broadcasting a new year’s program.

Ye Sen and ye Zhuo were busy pasting couplets and window decorations.

At this moment, Ye Shu’s voice came from the kitchen. “Sear Sear, the vinegar at home is gone. Go to the supermarket outside and buy a bottle.”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo put down the couplet in his hand and replied, “I’ll go now.”

He took his cell phone and casually put on his coat. Then, Ye Zhuo rushed out of the door.

The supermarket was just outside the neighborhood.

Ye Shu was waiting to use vinegar, so ye Zao jogged all the way.

Unexpectedly, he bumped into a passerby at the corner in front of him.

The vinegar bottle slipped out of his hand.

PA —

The glass bottle was broken.

In an instant, the fragrance of vinegar filled the air.

“I’m sorry, are you okay?”Ye Zao hurriedly apologized. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“I’m fine.”The man patted the dust off his black windbreaker.

This voice seemed a little familiar.

Ye Zao looked up.

It was song Shiyu.

“Mr. Song?”

Song Shiyu did not expect that the person who bumped into him was ye Zao. “Miss Ye, I’m sorry. I spilled your vinegar.”

“It’s fine. It’s not your fault. I didn’t watch where I was going. I’ll go buy another bottle.”Ye Zao did not immediately go back to buy vinegar. Instead, he squatted down, picked up the pieces on the ground, and threw them into the trash can, he did not want to hurt the passersby.

Song Shiyu also squatted down and helped ye Zao Pick Up the pieces.

The two good-looking hands picked up the same piece of debris out of the blue.

Their fingertips touched the tip of their fingers.

It was like a tiny electric current.

Both of them were stunned.

Ye Zao did not feel awkward. He directly let go of the hand holding the broken glass and picked up another piece of debris.

There was no special expression on song Shiyu’s face.

It was as if nothing had happened.

After picking up all the pieces, ye Zao went back to the supermarket to buy vinegar.

However, when he was paying, song Shiyu beat him to it.

“Mr. Song, you’re too polite. I can do it myself.”

Song Shiyu smiled faintly. “It’s just a bottle of vinegar. Miss Ye, you don’t have to be polite with me.”

“Then I won’t be polite.”Ye Zao waved the vinegar in his hand and pointed in a direction. “My house is just over there. Mr. Song, if you have time, come and play. Today is the New Year’s Eve, so I’ll invite you in for tea.”

“Okay.”Song Shiyu nodded slightly.

“Then I’ll go back first. My mother is still waiting for the vinegar to go back and cook.”

“Take care, Miss Ye.”After saying that, song Shiyu seemed to have thought of something. He pointed at ye Zao’s arm and said, “Your clothes seem to be drenched in vinegar. I have a handkerchief here. Do you want to roll up your sleeves and wipe it?”

“It’s okay.”Ye Zao said indifferently, “Just go home and change into another one. Goodbye, Mr. Song.”

“Goodbye.”Song Shiyu nodded slightly.

After ye Zhuo turned around, a look of disappointment appeared in his eyes.

It was fleeting.

At this moment, a luxury car stopped by the roadside. The car door was opened and the driver walked out of the car. He bowed respectfully to song Shiyu. “Boss.”

Song Shiyu leaned into the car. The winter sunlight cast a layer of coldness on his face. “Let’s go back.”

The driver also got into the car.

The car sped along and soon arrived at the song family estate.

The moment the car stopped, the assistant walked over and opened the car door.

“Check all the information on ye Zhuo and Mu Yourong. Send them to my study later.”

“Okay.”The assistant nodded.

“And photos.”Song Shiyu added, “In the summer, preferably full-body photos.”

The assistant nodded.

After ye Zhuo went home, he couldn’t wait to take a shower.

His arm was drenched in vinegar.

It was sour.

It smelled a little bad.

After taking a shower and coming out of the bathroom, Ye Zhuo went to blow-dry his hair.

He rolled up his sleeves to his elbow.

Her skin was very white, and her wrist was very thin. She could be held with just one hand. Near her elbow, there was a very obvious bite mark.

The color was pale.

But because of her white skin, it was obvious.
