“Man Jiangshan continued, “No qualification means no qualification. Your mother just came back and the journey was tiring. Let her rest for a while.” ”

“Man Xing wanted to ask more, but at that moment, man Wen crossed his arms and limped in from outside the door. ”

Ye Han did not show any mercy at all.

“Seeing Man Wen like this, man Xing immediately ran over and said with concern, “Man Wen, what happened to you? Who bullied you!” ” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“No one bullied me. You Don’t have to care about this!”Man Wen impatiently waved man Xing’s hand away.

“Man Xing was almost thrown to the ground by man Wen’s wave. Fortunately, Zhao Dan caught her in time. “Xing ‘er, are you okay?” ”

“Man Xing shook her head. “Mom, I’m fine. Man Wen seems to be injured! Do you want to go up and take a look...” ”

“”He must have gone to fight with someone else again! Don’t worry about him!”Zhao Dan said indifferently, “He’s already 19 years old. He’s always so random. As long as he’s half as sensible as you, he wouldn’t be like this now!” ”

“Hearing that, man Wen’s feet paused on the stairs, but he quickly recovered and continued to walk upstairs. ”

He was indeed just a playboy.

It was very normal for his mother to have such a reaction.

“MAN XING said, “Mom, don’t talk about him like that in front of Man Wen! He’s a boy and has pride. He won’t be able to stand it if you talk about him like that.” ”

“At this point, man xing paused and continued, “Boys need encouragement and comfort. Moreover, Man Wen’s character is different from other boys...” ”

“”If he knew that he couldn’t take it, he should have restrained himself! Look at him now!”At this point, Zhao Dan sighed, “Your father and I can only rely on you for the rest of Our Lives!” ”

“As for Manwen, it was already good enough that he could protect himself! ”

Zhao Dan’s words had touched the hearts of the entire country!

“From the beginning to the end, he did not expect Manwen to have any great abilities. ”

“However, it was enough for him to have such an outstanding daughter like the full moon in his life! ”

“Manxing said a little embarrassedly, “Father and mother, actually, Manwen is not worse than me. He just has a child’s temper and likes to play! When he is older, he will be better once he has a family.” ”

“A family? Who would be willing to marry his daughter to him? Wouldn’t that be harming the little girl?”Zhao Dan said.

“MAN XING said gently, “Actually, as long as the woman has a good character, she doesn’t have to be of the same social status...” ”

“”Let’s not talk about him, let’s not talk about him.”Zhao Dan waved his hand repeatedly. “When I talk about him, I’m full of anger!” ”

“MAN XING nodded and continued, “Then elder sister...”. ”

“”You won’t have an eldest sister in the future!”Man Jiangshan continued, “That kind of heartless ingrate, even if you really acknowledge her back, you won’t be able to raise her well! It’s better to not acknowledge her! In my entire life, I, Man Jiangshan, only have you as my daughter!” ”

“Hearing this, man xing frowned and said, “But why?” ”

“Man Jiangshan saw that man Xing was determined to get a result, so he could only tell man Xing what happened. ”

“”Ye Zao never thought of us as family. It’s fine if he doesn’t want such a daughter!”Man Jiangshan continued, “Xing ‘er, I know that you’re a good child and a good sister, but ye Zao is not a good sister! She never thought of you, and she never thought of our family. Forget it! It’s not sweet to force things. Since she doesn’t want to Know Us, then we don’t have to force her!” ”

“MAN XING said, “Dad, actually, I quite understand elder sister. After all, she hasn’t lived with us since she was young. “Even though you and mom gave her life, you didn’t fulfill your responsibility of raising her... “... Even though elder sister’s actions were a little inappropriate, she is your daughter after all. She is the elder sister of Me and Man Wen. You are her parents, while I am her younger brother and sister. Naturally, I won’t bother with her about this ... .. ”

“”Silly child, I know that you won’t bother with her about this, but reason isn’t this reason! “If she dares to ignore you now, what will happen in the future?”Zhao dan continued, “In any case, in the future, the full moon will be the full moon, and Ye Zhuo will be ye Zhuo. Xing ‘er, you just have to remember that your elder sister is already dead!” ”

Man Xing sighed.

...

On the other side.

Man Wen sat on the bed and lowered his head to sterilize his wound.

Bang!

“Suddenly, a figure jumped in from the window. ”

Man Wen was not very surprised. He did not even raise his head.

“Fan Mu stood up and looked at man Wen. She said in surprise, “Who beat you up like this?” ”

“”I accidentally fell,”man Wen said. ”

Fan Mu was immediately amused. “Then you are really amazing! To be able to fall like this!”
