“I’m not looking at them.”Cen Shaoqing stuffed the prayer beads into his pocket. “They can’t look at you either.”

“As he finished speaking, Cen Shaoqing continued, “Ye Han called a little girl over and said that he wants Lin Ze to introduce him to someone. Do you want to go take a look?” ”

“Are we there yet?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Let’s go.”Ye Zhuo held Cen Shaoqing’s hand. “Let’s go and take a look.”

The two of them walked over together.

Ye Han was introducing Bai Mo to everyone.

“Bai Mo was 1.59 meters tall and looked cute. When she smiled, she had two small dimples and a pair of standard almond-shaped eyes. ”

“At 1.59 meters, she stood in front of Lin Ze, who was 1.85 meters tall. She looked even more petite. ”

“Seeing ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing come over, ye Han immediately said, “Bai Mo, this is my sister, Ye Zhuo. You should have met her before. This is my sister’s boyfriend, Cen Shaoqing.” ”

“Bai Mo naturally knew the identities of ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing, but she wasn’t embarrassed and said in a graceful manner, “Miss Ye, Mr. Cen.” ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Ye Han continued to display the ‘matchmaker’specialty, he then said, “Bai Mo, why don’t you exchange contact information with brother Ze! We can hang out together in the future. If I remember correctly, didn’t you like going to Earth previously? If you go to Earth in the future, you can let brother Ze BE YOUR TOUR GUIDE!” ”

“Sure.”Bai Mo nodded with a smile.

The two of them exchanged contact information.

“Ye Zao was not involved in this matter. After greeting each other, he went for a walk with Cen Shaoqing on the other side. ”

“What do you think about that little girl and Lin Ze?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

Ye Zao shook his head slightly. “I feel that she’s not suitable for my brother.”

“Why?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Do you believe it or not? Bai Mo doesn’t even like my brother.” ”

Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads. “You’re so sure?” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

He only took a casual glance and didn’t observe carefully.

“”Of course, why don’t you take a look at who I am?” ”

“After the beach trip ended, ye Han called Bai Mo to the side and asked, “How is it? Brother Ze isn’t bad, right? Tall and handsome! Haven’t you always wanted to find someone with long legs?” ”

“”Handsome is quite handsome, but it’s just not suitable for me,”Bai Mo said tactfully. ”

“Why?”Ye Han asked in surprise.

“”There’s no reason,”Bai Mo continued, “It’s just that he gave me the feeling at first glance, and didn’t have the urge to grow old together.” ”

“This was the first time ye Han had heard this sentence as a matchmaker, and he couldn’t help but feel a little defeated. “Love grows over time. Why Don’t you guys start as friends first?” ”

“Bai Mo shook her head. “Since we’ve already become matchmaking partners, how can we really become friends?” ”

“”Alright,”ye Han continued, “If you can’t, then forget it. Relationships really can’t be forced.” ”

“Okay.”Bai Mo nodded. “But I still have to thank you.”

“”You’re welcome. Who’s with whom?”Ye Han patted Bai Mo’s shoulder. “If I meet a handsome guy in the future, I’ll introduce him to you.” ”

“Okay.”

“After ye Han left, Bai Mo’s good friend Li Wei asked, “Mo Mo, why did you reject ye Han? I think that Lin Ze is indeed very outstanding in all aspects!” ”

“”He’s from Earth,”Bai Mo said. ”

“When it came to marriage, it was very important to be of equal status. ”

“If she married an earthling, her children and grandchildren would be earthlings for generations to come, and she would never be able to make it. ”

“No matter how good Lin Ze’s external conditions were, she would not let herself be wronged by marrying an earthling. ”

“Li Wei was a little speechless as she said, “So what! His sister is Miss Ye! His brother-in-law is the young master of Dongli. He will definitely have a limitless future in the future!” ”

“”He is him, and Miss Ye is Miss Ye!”Bai Mo continued, “You don’t understand at all.” ”

Could it be that ye Zao could bring Lin Ze along and soar to great heights?

The reason why ye Zao was so outstanding was because she was Miss Ye.

The reason why Cen Shaoqing could become the young master of Dongli was because his surname was Cen.

What did Lin Ze have? His entire life could be seen at a glance.

“Li Wei continued, “In that case, are you really going to give up on such a handsome man?” ”

“”If you like him, Go and chase after him,”Bai Mo said. ”

“Li Wei smiled and said, “You don’t even like him, yet you still want me to chase after him. What do you have in mind?” ”

“Bai Mo asked back, “Then why are you still trying to persuade me? What do you have in mind?” ”

“After ye Han went back, he told Lin ze about this matter. ”

“Hearing this, Lin Ze was not surprised at all. He took a sip of water and said, “I can see that. So, don’t worry about my matters in the future.” ”

“Ye Han was not discouraged. “Brother Ze, don’t worry. I will definitely find a better one for you.” ”

Lin Ze:”...”

“Soon, it was the day of the election. ”

Man Xing sat in front of his desk and looked at the list of candidates. A strange light flashed in his eyes.

“What’s Wrong?”Master Cao asked.

Man Xing looked at Master Cao. “Man Wen is also on the list.”

“Man Wen?”Master Cao was also surprised.

Man Xing nodded and handed the list to master Cao. “Take a look.”

Master Cao took the list and frowned slightly.

Man Wen didn’t have the strength or reputation in man Xing country. It was really hard to understand how he got on the list.

“After a while, master Cao put down the list and said, “Xing ‘er, don’t take this matter to heart. I have arranged everything for you. Even if man Wen is really on the list, it’s just to get a head!” ”

Man Xing had performed very well recently. He would definitely stand out among the three heirs.
