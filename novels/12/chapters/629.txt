Mr. Zhang had been assisting the founder of female Durban to manage female Durban for a period of time.

“In these five years, he had seen all kinds of rebellious, lawless, violent, and playful rich and powerful young ladies. ”

“No matter how bad a problem girl’s character was, in female Durban, she could transform into a good woman with three followers and four virtues. ”

“Moreover, this Lin family’s eldest daughter was just a little girl who had just come from the countryside. ”

“After being locked up and starved for a few days, she would naturally be obedient. ”

“A man is iron rice and steel. When the time came for her to bark like a dog, she would have to do it. ”

“Therefore, Mr. Zhang did not take ye Zhuo to heart at all. ”

He had even solved the most troublesome problem of a young girl. How could he not solve the problem of a little girl from the countryside?

“Hearing this, Old Mrs. Lin nodded in satisfaction. “So, Mr. Zhang is confident that he can correct all the bad behavior of my granddaughter?” ”

Mr. Zhang nodded as well. “Yes.”

“Old Mrs. Lin stood up and said, “Then I’ll leave my granddaughter to you, Mr. Zhang.” ”

“”No problem.”Mr. Zhang continued, “Also, let me introduce to you. Our training class is under closed management. The teaching period is one month. During this one month, other than the teachers, the students are not allowed to contact anyone else. Their cell phones will also be confiscated. “After you sign the contract, you have to attend a full month of classes. You can not go back on your words after that.” ”

The management of female Durban was very strict. This one month of training could be said to be hell-like devil training.

The girls with fierce temperaments could still carry on for seven to eight days.

Some girls had only gone in for two days before their temperaments were worn down and they became like marionettes.

“”Good, good. This is good. Don’t worry, Mr. Zhang. We won’t regret it.”Old Mrs. Lin continued, “We should lock her up for a month. Otherwise, she’ll never know the immensity of Heaven and Earth!” ”

What was a month?

“For someone like Ye Zhuo, a year was not much. ”

“Mr. Zhang stood up and took out a contract from his bag. “Old Lady, the tuition fee for our female Durban is 100,000 yuan. If you don’t think it’s a problem, sign the contract.” ”

Aunt Zhang walked over to take the contract and handed it to Old Lady Lin.

Old Lady Lin took the contract and signed it without even looking at it.

She couldn’t wait to send ye Zao to female Durban.

“Out of sight, out of mind. ”

She looked forward to meeting an obedient and sensible granddaughter in a month’s time.

“At that time, she could officially change ye Zao’s name! ”

She would also have to ask ye Zao to apologize to Feng Xianxian.

“After all, Ye Zao had arrogantly snatched away Feng Xianxian’s boyfriend. ”

“Mr. Zhang stood up and said, “Old Madam, since the contract has been signed, I won’t bother you anymore. Tomorrow Morning at 7:30, let Miss Lin Report.” ”

“”Mr. Zhang, please wait a moment.”Old Madam Lin stood up as well. ”

“Mr. Zhang stopped in his tracks. “Old Madam, please speak.” ”

“Old Madam Lin continued, “My granddaughter is extremely mischievous. In order to avoid any unnecessary complications, can I trouble you to take her away now?” ”

Mr. Zhang hesitated for a moment. “That’s fine too.”

Old Madam Lin turned to look at Aunt Zhang. “Go and call for help.”

“Alright.”

Aunt Zhang walked towards the east wing.

Only Old Mrs. Lin and Mr. Zhang were left in the hall.

“Old Mrs. Lin continued, “Mr. Zhang, if that granddaughter of mine isn’t willing to go with you, do you have any other ways to bring her away?” ”

“Mr. Zhang smiled and said, “Don’t worry, Old Mrs. Lin. No matter how powerful a child is, seeing me is like seeing a mouse seeing a cat! Leave everything to me. You Don’t have to worry about other problems.” ”

Mr. Zhang had stayed in female Durban for so long. He had a hundred ways to educate those troubled girls.

“Really?”Old Lady Lin said in disbelief.

“”I, Zhang, never lie.” ”

“That’s good! Then I’ll leave my granddaughter to you in the future!”

“Not long after, Aunt Zhang came over with Ye Zhuo. ”

“”Old Lady, the eldest miss is here.” ”

“Old Lady Lin Glanced at ye Zhuo and said with a straight face, “This is the person in charge of the female Durban class, Mr. Zhang! I’ve signed you up for a female Durban class. The class period is one month. From today onwards, you can go to class with Mr. Zhang.” ”

Female Durban Class?

Ye Zhuo raised her eyebrows slightly. “It’s the female Durban class with three followers and four Virtues?”

Did she not hear wrongly?

“This was already the 21st century, and there were still people promoting such old-fashioned feudal ideas? ”
