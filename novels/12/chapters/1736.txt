Translator: 549690339

“Cen Shaoqing was about to cry, “Leader, you’re not joking with me, right?” ”

“Do you think I look like I’m joking with You?”Ye searing suddenly became serious.

“Yes!”

“”I’m really not joking with you,”ye searing said extremely seriously, “I used to be such a person. Cen Shaoqing, if you regret it now, it’s still not too late!” ”

“”What are you talking about! I don’t regret it! No matter what kind of person you were before, I will never regret it!”He was afraid that ye Zao would run away, as he spoke, Cen Shaoqing held her hand tightly. 108th was 108th. Even if he was not the first person ye Zao loved, he was the last person ye Zao loved. ”

“Looking at Cen Shaoqing who was so serious, ye Zao laughed softly. ”

“Cen Shaoqing’s tensed heart also relaxed at this moment. “Leader, you’re joking with me, right?” ”

“”I didn’t think that a fool like you would believe it!”Ye Zao continued, “108 boyfriends! How can I have the energy to have so many boyfriends!” ”

“Then how many do you have the energy to have?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

Ye Zao extended his index finger.

“One?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Although he had gone from 108 to one, Cen Shaoqing still felt a little stifled in his heart. ”

“How does he look? Is he outstanding?”

“”He’s very handsome and also very outstanding,”ye Zhuo said. ”

“Hearing this answer, Cen Shaoqing felt even more depressed. “Compared to me?” ”

“Hearing this, Ye Zhuo looked at Cen Shaoqing seriously and said, “This, it’s really hard to say...” ”

“It seemed that he was still a formidable character and had some status in ye Zhuo’s heart. Otherwise, ye Zhuo would not have said this. ”

This was a little harder to accept than hearing ye Zhuo say that he had 108 boyfriends.

“Dating 108 boyfriends meant that ye Zhuo was only playing in the human world. Other than him, Ye Zhuo had never been sincere with anyone else. ”

But now there was only one!

This was a big problem!

It meant that ye Zao had a deep affection for him and had never forgotten about him.

“He could not think about it carefully. The more he thought about it, the more uncomfortable he felt. ”

Cen Shaoqing was about to cry.

1

“After a while, CEN Shaoqing continued, “Then is he taller than me?” ”

“Ye Zao said, “About the same height as you.” ”

About the same height?

“He was 1.9 meters tall, but that man was actually about the same height as him! ”

“How did he treat you?”

“Very well.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

Very well!

Cen Shaoqing felt that his position was threatened. “Then... then do you still love him?”

No!

Definitely not.

“Cen Shaoqing looked at ye Zhuo with his Bright Eyes, afraid that he would miss ye Zhuo’s answer. ” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Ye Zhuo looked up at him. “Do you want to hear the truth or lies?”

Cen Shaoqing’s heart skipped a beat.

He had already asked this question.

It definitely meant that Cen Shaoqing still had that person in his heart.

“”Leader, you don’t have to answer. I already know the answer.” ”

“Seeing Cen Shaoqing turn into a frosted eggplant, ye zhuo smiled and continued, “Aren’t you curious about his name?” ”

“”There’s nothing to be curious about.”Cen Shaoqing held ye Zhuo’s hand. “Anyway, it’s already in the past. The person standing by your side now is me, and the person by your side in the future is also me. From now on, it’ll be me for the rest of my life!” ”

Cen Shaoqing was already beginning to regret asking ye Zao this question.

“But I’m still in love with him. Are you sure you won’t Mind?”Ye Zao continued to ask.

“Cen Shaoqing lowered his eyes slightly. “If I say that I really mind, will you forget him?” ”

“No.”Ye Zao shook his head slightly.

“The ink in Cen Shaoqing’s eyes surged. He reached out and grabbed the back of ye Zao’s head. Then, he bent down slightly and pressed ye Zao against the Maple Tree. He leaned over and directly sealed her red lips with his thin lips. He swallowed the rest of his words. ”

This kiss was very aggressive. It was extremely domineering.

“Five to six minutes later, he finally let go of her. ”

He was slightly panting.

“Cen Shaoqing reached out and pressed his hand against the tree trunk. He looked at ye Zao and said, “Don’t mention him in front of me in the future. Otherwise, I’ll kiss him every time you mention him.” ”

Ye Zao looked at Cen Shaoqing and suddenly thought of a word.

Overbearing CEO.

Cen Shaoqing looked like a domineering CEO now.

“After a while, ye Zao chuckled. “Mr. Cen, are you jealous?” ”

“”I’m not,”Cen Shaoqing directly denied. ”

“Really?”Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly.

“”There’s nothing to be jealous about,”cen shaoqing continued, “Can he kiss you like I did just now?” ”

“We used to do that too.”Ye Zhuo deliberately teased him.
