An eight-seater business car could hold a lot of things.

His mother looked at Jerry. “Now you can finally tell me why. Why did we suddenly leave?”

“I’ll tell you when we get out.”

“Okay.”His mother carried the dog and sat in the back seat.

Amy got in the back seat as well.

“Jerry put his things in the back seat, then went to the driver’s seat and drove away. ”

“As he drove away, he looked back at the house he had lived in for more than twenty years. He didn’t know if the house would still be there the next time he came back. ”

“The next second, Jerry started the engine and drove away. ”

“The car was moving very fast. Fortunately, there weren’t many people on the road, so Jerry arrived at the ferry very quickly. ”

“He still needed to get a certificate when he went out. Today was the last day, and those who were supposed to leave had already left, so there weren’t many people at the entrance to get a certificate. The family of three successfully got a certificate. ”

“Just as they were getting a certificate, they saw that their cousin’s family had also come over to get a certificate. ”

“Their cousin, Elena, was still a little skeptical about this matter. “Jerry, are you sure we really have to leave? I heard that if we stay in L continent with Dr. Mario, we can receive a subsidy of 1,000 yuan a day!” ”

“In l continent, the average person’s income was less than 100 dollars a day. ”

“One could imagine how tempting a subsidy of 1,000 dollars was. ”

“”We have to leave,”Jerry said very seriously. “Otherwise, when you want to leave, it will be too late! The exit will be closed soon!” ”

“After saying that, Jerry continued, “What about cousin Mark and the others?” ”

“Elena continued, “Of course he’s staying at home to receive his allowance!” ”

“Wasn’t the reward of 1,000 dollars worth worth of money fragrant? ”

“Because of Mario’s policy, many people who had already left had returned to L continent. ”

Jerry frowned slightly. “Didn’t he receive my message?”

“”Yes,”Elena continued, “But he doesn’t want to leave. You should know him. He treats money like his life! Moreover, he doesn’t believe what you’re saying at all! “To be honest, I don’t believe what you’re saying either. If there’s really danger, would Dr. Mario be an idiot?” ”

“To the people of L continent, Mario’s actions weren’t small. ”

Gerri picked up his phone and dialed Mark’s number.

“Very soon, the call was connected. Mark’s sloppy words came through. “My dear cousin, may I ask why you’re looking for me?” ”

Jerry went straight to the point. “Pack your things and leave L continent immediately.”

“Mark on the other end of the phone was probably eating something, he said with a lisp, “You Guys Go! I want to see what kind of monster would bring disaster to L continent. If there really is such a monster, then it can only be blamed on my bad luck!” ”

“”You will regret it!”Jerry frowned and said, “You have no idea how terrifying that thing is!” ”

“”Don’t worry, cousin, I won’t regret it!”Mark finished an apple and continued, “I have an appointment in the afternoon. I Won’t talk to you anymore. Goodbye, Cousin.” ”

“After that, Mark hung up the phone. ”

Gerri frowned.

“Elena smiled and said, “Then, are we still leaving?” ”

“Yes!”Gerri put his ID card in front of the car window.

Elena followed Jerry’s footsteps.

“When the group of people were driving on the ferry island, they saw that their relatives were already waiting at the exit. ”

“Seeing Jerry and the others coming over, Jerry’s aunt Karen immediately came forward to welcome them. “Jerry, what’s going on? is what you said true?” ”

Jerry nodded. “It’s true!”

“Karen clasped her hands together. “God bless us, we must ensure that everyone is safe and sound.” ”

“After saying that, Karen realized that mark was not around. “Where’s Mark?” ”

“Jerry said somewhat helplessly, “He doesn’t want to come out.” ”

Karen covered her mouth in surprise. “Then what should we do?”

“Jerry shook his head. “With a word from China, we can only let him fend for himself.” ”

“Mark was not in a hurry at all. After hanging up on Jerry, he went to the bar. ”

“Although many people from L continent had left, these places were still lively, as if the things outside had nothing to do with this place. ”

Mark looked at the scene of singing and dancing in the bar and thought of what Jerry had said to him. The corners of his mouth were full of disdainful smiles.

Jerry was a coward.

He actually believed that kind of nonsense.

He did not believe that l continent would be in a desperate situation because of an unknown creature.
