Translator: 549690339

“A moment later.., zheng wanyin continued, “But Grandma, cousin and sister-in-law are true love. If they really break up, I will also feel uneasy! This is my fault to begin with. As the saying goes, it’s better to tear down a temple than to tear down a marriage... “... “...”at the end of her sentence.., zheng Wanyin’s words were slowly filled with guilt. ”

“”This has nothing to do with you,”Xie Wanqiu said. “If there’s retribution, it should be on that little b * Tch ye Zao!” ”

Zheng Wanyin was a victim. What retribution could she have?

“Zheng Wanyin wanted to say something else, but Xie wanqiu continued, “Alright, Alright. Wanyin, I want to rest. Let Me be quiet. Don’t keep pleading for that Little B * tch in front of my ears.” ”

It was annoying to hear that.

“Seeing Xie wanqiu like this, Zheng Wanyin could only shut her mouth, but a glimmer of light flashed in her eyes. ”

Although she had only known ye Zhuo for a few days.

Zheng Wanyin knew ye Zhuo very well.

Ye Zhuo had a cold personality and was a hot-blooded person. He was definitely not the kind of person who would casually apologize.

Let Her apologize to Xie Wanqiu?

It was even more impossible!

“Just like what Xie Wanqiu said, she was Cen Shaoqing’s grandmother. If ye Zhuo did not apologize to Xie wanqiu, what else could Cen Shaoqing Do? ”

“For such an outstanding person like Cen Shaoqing, what kind of girlfriend could he not find? ”

So...

He would let a person with bad morals take over his girlfriend’s position?

Did he really think that CEN fifth master’s title came for nothing?

One had to admit that Xie Wanqiu’s move was truly brilliant.

It was simply exquisite beyond compare.

Zheng Wanyin covertly hid the expression in her eyes.

“At this moment, Xie wanqiu seemed to have suddenly thought of something and continued, “Yinyin.” ”

“Please speak.”Zheng Wanyin turned to look at Xie wanqiu.

“Xie wanqiu continued, “You’re not allowed to go back to the Cen family during this period of time.”She had to get ye Zhuo to come over personally to apologize to her, and then Cen Shaoqing, Zhou Xiang, and that old B * Tch Bai Tang would come over personally to pick her up. Otherwise.., she would definitely not go back! ”

Zheng Wanyin nodded. “Got it.”

“After saying that, Zheng wanyin continued to ask, “Grandma, how long do you plan to stay here?” ”

“Xie wanqiu said, “Tomorrow, tomorrow morning, Shaoqing will definitely bring ye Zao over to apologize! Even if he doesn’t come tomorrow morning, it won’t be more than three days!” ”

Three days at most!

“Zheng Wanyin nodded slightly, knowing what to do. ”

...

The night passed very quickly.

“In the morning, Zheng Wanyin rushed to the hospital from the hotel early in the morning. ”

People who were old did not fall asleep.

“When she arrived at the hospital, Xie Wanqiu was already awake. When she saw Zheng Wanyin, she smiled and said, “Yinyin is here.” ”

“Zheng Wanyin nodded. “Grandma, I brought you preserved egg and lean meat porridge.” ”

“Okay.”

Xie wanqiu loved to eat preserved egg and lean meat porridge the most.

“However, Zhou Xiang never remembered her preferences. Only Zheng Wanyin was filial. No matter what, Zheng Wanyin would always remember what she liked to eat and drink. ”

What right did someone like Zhou Xiang have to be her daughter?

Her precious granddaughter was the best.

“Zheng Wanyin placed the thermos bucket on the table and looked around. She lowered her voice and said, “Grandma, cousin and the others didn’t come?” ”

“According to Xie wanqiu, they should have seen Cen Shaoqing and Ye Zhuo this morning. ”

“However, the ward was empty. ”

“They wouldn’t really have to wait for three days, right? ”

“There’s no rush.”Xie Wanqiu wasn’t flustered at all. “It’s only been a day.”

“Okay.”Zheng Wanyin opened the thermos bucket and filled a bowl of porridge for Xie wanqiu.

On the other side.

At the CEN residence.

“Early in the morning, Zhou Xiang arrived at Xie Wanqiu’s bedroom. ”

“When she pushed the door open, there was no one inside. ”

Xie Wanqiu did not come back last night.

It seemed that she had really made up her mind this time.

Zhou Xiang sighed. It was really worrying enough.

Old Mrs. Cen’s attitude was very firm. There was no way she would let ye Zhuo apologize to Xie wanqiu.

And Xie Wanqiu was also unwilling to come back.

The two of them could not remain in a stalemate like this forever.

“After some thought, Zhou Xiang made a call. ”

“Very soon, the call was connected. ”

“Second aunt.”Zheng Wanyin’s voice came from the other side.

“Zhou Xiang looked at the side and said in a low voice, “Wanyin, where are you now? Are you still in the hospital?” ”

“”Yes,”Zheng Wanyin said. ” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Hearing Zheng Wanyin say that she was still in the hospital, Zhou Xiang felt a headache coming on. “Your grandmother is still angry?” ”

“Zheng Wanyin glanced at Xie wanqiu who was on the bed. As she walked out, she said in a low voice, “Not yet...” ”

“She walked out of the ward and closed the door. Only then did Zheng Wanyin dare to say in a normal voice, “Second aunt, you should know grandmother’s temper. I tried to persuade her last night, but she didn’t listen at all. I’m trying to think of a way...” ”
