“Ye, ye Zao? ”

Feng Qianqian was stunned.

Did she hear wrong?

Weren’t the professors here to look for her?

Why did they call out ye Zao’s name?

“Feng Qianqian’s face turned stiff at this moment, and a layer of sweat formed on her back. ”

She heard wrong!

She must have heard wrong!

“Ye Zao was just a country bumpkin from a small place. If he wanted results and no results, if he did not have a family background, the professors definitely did not come to look for ye Zao! ”

“Seeing that Feng Xianxian did not speak for a long time, the bald professor looked into the dormitory and asked, “Hello, student, may I ask if ye Zao lives in this dormitory?” ”

Ye Zao!

It was really ye Zao.

Why was it ye Zao?

Feng Xianxian’s lowered eyes were filled with unwillingness.

The professors could not see ye Zao!

“The other people in the dormitory thought that the professors were here to look for her, so she even touched up her makeup. If they knew that the professors were not here to look for her, but to look for ye Zao, where would she put her face? ”

“Feng Xianxian looked up and was about to say that she did not know ye Zao, but at this moment, Li Yueyue ran out and said excitedly, “He lives! He lives! Ye Zao lives in this dormitory!” ”

Li Yueyue liked ye Zao very much.

“When she found out that the professors were here to look for ye Zao, Li Yueyue was exceptionally excited! ”

She knew that ye Zao was not simple.

Damn Li Yueyue!

“At this moment, Feng Xianxian wanted to tear Li Yueyue apart. Her expression was extremely ugly. ”

“When she heard this, the bald professor said excitedly, “Student, can you help us call ye Zao?” ”

“”Yes, yes!”Li Yueyue nodded hurriedly. “Please Wait a moment, I’ll go call ye Zao Right Now!” ”

“Thank you.”

“Feng Xianxian stood rooted to the ground. It was not a good idea to leave, but it was even more awkward for her to stay. ”

“At that moment, she could only walk into the dormitory. ”

She did not expect that ye Zao would embarrass her so much on the first day!

What right did ye Zao have?

Wasn’t she just a pretty girl who was inferior to her in everything?

“Li Yueyue ran inside. “Ye Zao, Ye Zao! Those professors outside are here to look for you! Go out for a while!” ”

Ye Zao had just finished drying his hair and was about to turn on his computer to surf the technology web. “They’re looking for me?”

What?

Looking for ye Zao?

Weren’t those people here to look for Feng Qianxian?

“Hearing that, Bai Xiaoman was dumbfounded! ”

Ye Zao was nothing. There was nothing. Why were the professors looking for her?

What right did ye Zao have for the professors to come personally to look for her?

“Bai Xiaoman looked up at Li Yueyue. “Li Yueyue, stop joking! Those professors outside are clearly here to look for Xianxian! What has it got to do with ye Zao!” ”

“”I’m not joking! Those professors outside are here to look for ye Zao! It’s your own mistake!”Li Yueyue continued, “Ye Zao, quickly go in and change your clothes. I’ll go and inform the professors.” ”

Ye Zao was currently wearing his pajamas. There was a vacuum inside. It was definitely not suitable for him to go out just like that.

“Ye Zao looked up slightly. “I’ll have to trouble you, Yueyue.” ”

“No problem.”Li Yueyue waved her hand and walked out of the door.

Ye Zao found a set of clothes to change into.

“Three minutes later, he appeared at the entrance of the dormitory. ”

There were a total of six people standing outside the door.

“When the Bald Professor saw ye Zao come out, he was extremely excited. “Student Ye! We’ve finally met you in person! First of all, let me introduce myself. I’m Ma Haishen, a professor from the physics department!” ”

“”Student Ye, I’m Feng Youzhi, a professor from the science and Technology Institute!” ”

“”Make way! Make Way!”A professor wearing glasses squeezed to the front, “Student Ye, I’m Zheng Zilong, a professor from the medical department. I heard that student ye has very deep attainments in medicine. Our Medical Department has recently had an experiment. I wonder if we can have the honor to invite student ye to participate in it?” ”

“”Why should student ye participate in Your Medical Department’s Experiment? Student Ye is the only one who has a full score in science! She should participate in our mathematics department’s Research! Student Ye, I Am Yin Xueming, a professor of the mathematics department!” ”

“”Old Yin, you are wrong to say that! I am also from the physics department! According to what you said, student ye should participate in our physics department’s experiment NO MATTER WHAT!” ”

“The few professors argued until their faces turned red, forcing the two deans of the School of life sciences and the School of Information Science and technology to the back. ”

“Seeing that the few of them were about to quarrel, ye Zhuo said indifferently, “Professor Feng, Professor Zheng, Professor Ma, Professor Yin, Dean Zhang, Dean Liu, this isn’t the place to talk. Why Don’t we go downstairs and talk?” ”

“Okay! Let’s go to the conference room and talk!”

The group of people walked downstairs in a grand manner.
