“With a doubtful heart, Zhou Xiaowen returned home. “Mom and Dad.” ”

“Your son is back.”Sun Guixiang immediately went forward to take the basketball from Zhou Xiaowen’s hands. “Is it hot outside today?”

“”It’s not bad.”Zhou Xiaowen continued, “By the way, Mom, I saw Auntie outside just now.” ”

Sun Guixiang was stunned for a moment and did not say anything. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Zhou Xiaowen continued, “Auntie seemed a little strange. I asked her why she did not enter the house, but she said that you were not at home. Dad, Mom, did you have a conflict with Auntie?” ”

“Ever since Zhou Xiaowen remembered, his father and Auntie’s relationship had been quite deep. Seeing this scene today, he was quite surprised. ”

“Sun guixiang smiled and said, “It’s nothing. It’s a matter between US adults. You’re just a child. Don’t bother about it.” ”

“Let’s eat.”Zhou Xiatian placed the dishes on the dining table.

“Sun guixiang immediately said, “Yes, yes, yes. Let’s eat.” ”

“Zhou Xiaowen was still a little puzzled, but he did not say anything in the end. ”

“Halfway through the meal, Zhou Xiatian continued, “Xiaowen, your mother and I are going to look at houses the afternoon of the day after tomorrow. Do you have time?” ”

“After working hard in the capital for more than ten years, the Zhou family had always rented a house. Recently, they had finally decided to buy a house with a mortgage. ”

“Yes.”Zhou Xiaowen nodded.

“”Okay, then let’s go together as a family of three.” ”

“After saying that, Zhou Xiatian put down the bowl and chopsticks and continued, “Oh right, Xiaowen, there’s one more thing. I didn’t tell you before because you were too busy. It’s time for me to tell you now.” ”

“When Zhou Xiaowen saw that his father’s expression was quite serious, he immediately put down the bowl and chopsticks and said, “Dad, What’s wrong? Tell me.” ”

“Zhou Xiaxia continued, “Your aunt and I have already broken off our sibling relationship.” ”

This sentence made Zhou Xiaowen a little confused.

How did they break off their relationship?

He had only been away from home for two months!

“”What’s going on?”Zhou Xiaowen did not know what to do for a moment. “Dad, are you joking with me?” ”

“Even if something huge had happened, he did not know that it had come to this point! ”

Zhou Xiatian did not want to talk about it anymore. She put down the bowl and chopsticks and walked into the room.

“”Mom, what’s Going On?”Zhou Xiaowen looked at Sun Guixiang. ”

“Sun Guixiang sighed. “Actually, your dad is not to blame for this.” ”

“Then what’s the reason?”Zhou Xiaowen immediately asked.

Sun Guixiang also put down her chopsticks. “It’s like this...”

“Hearing this, Zhou Xiaowen was also very surprised. Who would have thought that his usually astute and wise aunt would make such a mistake. ”

“”Your father tried to persuade her, but she just wouldn’t listen. She thought that she had hooked a rich husband! “And she still had to sever her relationship with your father. You Don’t even know how tough she was back then. Tell me, it’s one thing for her to be deceived, but she still had to drag hang hang along with her.” ”

“At this point, Sun Guixiang paused, then, she continued, “Hang used to look like a sensible and filial child. Only at a critical moment could she see clearly who she was! When she heard that her mother had found a rich stepfather for her, she wanted to disown her father no matter what! “No matter how your father tried to persuade her, he refused to listen. He even thought that we were jealous that she had found a rich stepfather! “Therefore, such people don’t need to sympathize with her at all! “They have brought this upon themselves!” ”

“Zhou Xiaowen found it hard to digest so many questions at once. He swallowed his throat and continued, “That means that little aunt and hang hang hang are now homeless? What about little uncle?” ”

“Your little uncle is not someone to be trifled with. I heard that he sold his house and went to other cities with his new wife.”

Li Da Long’s intention was very obvious. He did not want to get involved with Li Hang and his daughter anymore.

“Sun guixiang continued, “Actually, I think your little uncle did the right thing. If I were him, I would do the same! You Don’t even know how much your little aunt has gone overboard! Anyway, I can’t watch it anymore!” ”

Zhou Xiaowen felt a little uncomfortable. “Then what about aunt and the others in the future?”

“Sun guixiang said, “Doesn’t hang hang have to go to work? It’s such a big city. Don’t worry, they won’t starve to death! Besides, Hang Hang is a top student. You Don’t have to worry about them anymore.” ”

“At the end of her sentence, Sun Guixiang stood up from her chair and began to clean up the dining table. ”

Zhou Xiaowen sat on the sofa in silence for half an hour before he went to the bedroom.

“Ten minutes later, there was a knock on the bedroom door. ”

Zhou Xiaowen went to open the door. “Dad.”

The person who came was Zhou Xiatian.

“Zhou Xiatian walked in from outside. “Xiaowen, let’s have a chat, shall we?” ”

“Okay.”

“Zhou Xiatian sat on the chair in the room. “Xiaowen, you already know about your aunt and I, right?” ”

“Yes.”Zhou Xiaowen nodded.

“”As adults, we should be responsible for our own actions. Your aunt is paying for her own actions now.”Zhou xiaxia continued, “I’ve said what I should say, and I’ve done what I should do. I’ve fulfilled my obligation as an elder brother. From now on, we won’t get involved in their affairs.” ”

“A person’s life was a process of continuous growth. Zhou Cui Hua was experiencing such a thing. If he treated this as if nothing had happened and forgave her.., zhou Cui Hua would never realize that she was wrong. ”

“Zhou Xiaowen sighed. “Dad, I understand.” ”

Over here.

“After Zhou Cui Hua left, she went to the detective agency. ”

“”Detective Wu, almost two months have passed. What did you guys find out? If you don’t find anything, give me a full refund.” ”
