This is...

Joey!

“Li Zi Yue narrowed his eyes. It seemed that his guess was right, Joey was ye Zhuo. ”

“Otherwise, there was no way to explain everything. ”

“”Brother Li! Brother Li! Look, she has turned into sister Qiao!”Second brother shook Li Zi Yue’s arm, “What is going on? How did Zhou Qing turn into sister Qiao!” ”

“Li Zi Yue’s expression remained the same, “This is the power of Gu Worms.” ”

Sun Xiao Qian said: “Oh! I understand! It was the Gu worms that changed Zhou Qing’s appearance!”

“Li Zi Yue narrowed his eyes, “The GU worms did not just change Zhou Qiang’s appearance!” ”

“Then what else?”Er Guo immediately asked.

Li Zi Yue said: “Wake Her Up!”

“How?”Ergo asked.

Li Ziyue slapped Ergo’s head. “I’m choking her.”

“OH.”Ergo immediately followed.

“A moment later, Zhou Qing slowly woke up. She opened her eyes and looked at the few of them with a blank expression. ”

“Who are you?”Li Ziyue asked.

“”Who am I?”Zhou Qing scratched her hair and thought for a long time before saying, “I’m Joey!” ”

“Then who is she?”Li Ziyue pointed at Sun Xiaoqian.

“Seeing Sun Xiaoqian, Zhou Qing’s eyes suddenly changed. She immediately stood up from the ground. “Zhou Qing! Why did you betray Miss Ye!” ”

“Sun Xiaoqian Chopped Zhou Qing unconscious with a hand knife. She turned to Li Ziyue and asked, “How long can she last like this?” ”

Li Ziyue stretched out two fingers.

“Two years?”Sun Xiao Fu asked.

Li Zi Yue shook his head.

“Two months?”

Li Zi Yue still shook his head.

“Sun Xiao Fu frowned and said somewhat speechlessly, “It can’t be two days, right?” ”

“”Yes, it is two days.”Li Zi Yue continued, “Sister Qiao said that everything will end on the day of the election. Therefore, these two days are also the most crucial two days. After you go back, you must keep in contact with us at all times and quickly investigate the betrayers hiding in the dark!” ”

“En.”Sun Xiao Qian nodded.

“ER guo continued: “Since this Gu worm thing is so useful, each of us brothers will have one, and we will all disguise ourselves as members of the Qiu clan. Wouldn’t it be more efficient to directly infiltrate the enemy’s inner circle?” ”

Li Zi Yue slapped er Guo’s head: “Do you think sister Qiao wouldn’t have thought of such a simple reason?”

“”What’s Wrong?”Er Qu was stunned, “Since she thought of it, why didn’t she do it?” ”

“Li Zi Yue continued, “This disguise gu worm lives in the host’s body, when the time comes, the host will be sucked dry of blood and die.” ”

“F * ck! So Scary!”Er Qu gulped.

“”What do you think?”Li Zi Yue turned to look at Sun Xiao Fu, saying: “There is no time, quickly take Zhou Qing and leave!” ”

“Okay.”Sun Xiaoqian nodded.

“Li Ziyue continued, “Be careful.” ”

“I know.”Sun Xiaoqian tied Zhou Qing up and took her out of the aircraft.

On the other side.

“When Yi Ling woke up, Ye Zao was gone. ”

“Yi Ling rubbed her eyes and shouted, “Great burning.” ”

There was no response in the air.

Was He in the laboratory?

Yi Ling flew to the laboratory.

The laboratory was empty.

Where did ye Zao Go?

“At this moment, Yi Ling found the note that ye Zao left on the table. ”

“After reading the contents of the note, Yi Ling’s expression changed. ”

Eternal Glacier!

She knew that ye Zao would not give up so easily.

What should she do now?

“Yi Ling was extremely anxious, she wanted to go to the Eternal Glacier to look for ye Zao. ”

But Ye Zao left the Gu worm behind.

This gu worm was used to deal with the Great Witch Doctor.

“If it left, what would happen to the Gu Worm? ”

The immemorial glacier.

“After flying for two hours, the aircraft landed at the peak of the glacier. ”

“This place was covered in white snow all year round and the temperature was extremely low. Even if ye Zao was wearing an air-conditioning suit that could adjust the temperature, under such extreme temperature, he still felt a bone-piercing cold. ” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“This kind of coldness was close to the depths of one’s soul, and there was nowhere to hide. ”

Ye Zao closed his black coat and walked forward.

“According to the medical books, the purple-leaf flower grew between the cliffs. ”

It bloomed in the snow.

“Its entire body was dark green, and its stems and leaves were oval-shaped. The buds were white, but the flowers in full bloom were purple-red. ”

They were colorless and tasteless.

“As a result, it was very difficult for anyone to find the purple-leaf flower. ”

“Two hours later, a layer of white frost condensed on Ye Zao’s eyelashes. ”

“She had walked through three cliffs in total, but she did not see any traces of the purple-leafed flower. ”

Ye Zao came to a big rock to shelter from the wind. She took out the kettle in her backpack and drank a big mouthful of water.
