The two of them.

“One was a top student who had gone abroad, while the other was a top student in China. ”

“Logically speaking, Gu Deling’s professional standards definitely couldn’t compare to Su Zishan’s. ”

But it just so happened.

Gu deling didn’t lose to Su Zishan in any way.

The two were evenly matched.

“Su Zishan had always been arrogant, how could she be willing to be suppressed by a nobody? ”

“Therefore, she often thought of ways to suppress gu dening. ”

“But Gu Dening was not a vegetarian, and Su Zishan did not take advantage of her. ”

“This time, Gu Dening finally walked down a path of no return. ”

How could Su Zishan not gloat?

“Without GU dening, no one would be able to steal her limelight in the future. ”

“She did not expect that gu dening, who usually seemed to be quite smart, would not be smart at the critical moment. Perhaps she was really crazy about wanting to be famous. ”

“Otherwise, why would she willingly lower her status and become an assistant to a little girl? ”

It was so silly that it was laughable!

“After saying that, Su Zishan continued, “We’re all colleagues. Little Gu, don’t worry. If this incident is traced back to you, I’ll definitely organize everyone to hold a farewell party for you.” ”

“Gu dening looked up at Su Zishan with a confident smile on her lips. “I appreciate doctor Su’s kind intentions, but I’d rather invite you to my celebration party with Miss Ye than the farewell party.” ”

“”Celebration Party?”Su Zishan smiled. “Little Gu, turn around and look at the window. The sky is still bright outside.” ”

She was mocking Gu decing for daydreaming.

“”Whether it’s a daydream or not, just look at it, doctor Su!” ”

“After saying this, Gu decing took the things she needed and turned around to leave. ”

“Looking at Gu decing’s back, Su Zishan snorted coldly. ”

Zhao pingting only had three months left.

She wanted to see how long Gu decing could be complacent!

...

“The next day, ye Zao went to the hospital. For the next few days, she stayed at home. ”

She closed the door and concentrated on studying the medicine.

“Unlike usual, this time, her desk was filled with all kinds of chemical instruments and medical tools. ” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Soon, two glass tubes appeared in her hands. ”

The transparent glass tubes were filled with blue liquid.

“”It’s Done!”Ye Zao exhaled lightly. He took off the plastic gloves in his hands, took his black backpack, and walked to the hospital. ”

“Because he had contacted gu dening in advance, ye Zao saw Gu dening waiting for her at the door as soon as he arrived at the hospital. ”

“When she saw ye Zao walking over, Gu Dening immediately came over to greet him. “Miss Ye!” ”

“Initially, gu dening only had the attitude of giving ye Zao a try. ”

But after spending a few days together.

Gu dening completely dispelled her previous opinion.

Although ye Zao was young.

He was indeed capable!

She believed that ye Zao would definitely be able to make everyone’s eyes light up.

Ye Zao nodded. “Is the lab ready?”

“Yes.”

Ye Zao took out a tube of medicine from his bag and handed it to Gu Dening. “Take this and test it to see if there are any of the ingredients I sent you!”

“”Okay, I’ll take you to the lab first.” ”

The equipment in the lab was very complete.

Ye Zao changed into a special sterile suit and began to refine the medicine.

Gu Dening took the medicine to the lab next door for testing.

“Five hours later, ye Zao came out of the lab. ”

“Gu dening just happened to come out of the lab as well. Both of them were wearing sterile suits. “Miss Ye, I’ve already tested it. There’s nothing wrong with the test results.” ”

“Ye Zao nodded. “Then you can give it to Pingting. Tonight, you should pay more attention to Pingting’s situation and take notes every half an hour.” ”

“Okay.”

“Taking off the sterile dressing, ye Zao went to Zhao Pingting’s ward. ”

“In the ward, mother Zhao was talking to Zhao Pingting. ”

“Seeing ye Zao come over, Zhao Pingting was very happy. “Zao Zao.” ”

“”Pingting,”ye Zao smiled and said, “I’m here to tell you some good news. The anti-cancer drug has been successfully developed. We will give you the drug later. If it goes well, we can have the surgery in a week. You can be discharged half a month after the surgery.” ”

“Really?”Zhao Pingting was pleasantly surprised.

Mother Zhao also stood up.

Ye Zao nodded.

“”Thank you, Zao Zao.”Zhao Pingting hugged ye Zao excitedly. ”

“After so many days, she had finally seen the light. ”

Zhao Pingting was really happy.

“Ye Zao patted Zhao Pingting’s back. “Pingting, you are too polite.” ”

“After a long while, Zhao Pingting finally let go of Ye Zao. ”

“Ye Zao continued, “The dosage this time is for five people in total. Go and ask if there are any other patients who want to be treated with you.” ”
