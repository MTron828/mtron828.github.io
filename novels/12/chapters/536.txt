“Chapter 537: 135: sister-protecting maniac, unexpected gay, face-smacking Feng Xianxian! 7”

Translator: 549690339

Wasn’t this hurting ye Shu’s heart?

“What did you say?”Old Lady Lin slammed the table and stood up.

“Lin Jincheng repeated what he had just said, “Mom, just give up on this idea. I will not change the surname of Searing Flames!””

“As expected, she had forgotten her mother after marrying a wife.”

“This was only the first day ye Shu had returned, and Lin Jincheng dared to treat her like this.”

“Old Lady Lin pointed at Lin Jincheng and said, “That is the flesh and blood of our Lin Family! The flesh and blood of our Lin family should be surnamed Lin!””

“Lin Jincheng looked at Old Lady Lin and said, “Even if the surname is ye, it is still the flesh and blood of our Lin Jincheng. It is the eldest daughter of our Lin Family!””

Old Lady Lin could only feel her temples throbbing.

She did not know what kind of drug that B * Tch Ye Shu had fed Lin Jincheng to make him tolerate his child not taking his surname.

How many fathers in the world could tolerate their child taking an outsider’s surname?

Old Lady Lin thought of Feng Xianxian again.

“Feng Xianxian was not related to Lin Jincheng by blood at all, but she had agreed to change her surname to Lin.”

What about Ye Zhuo?

He was simply Shameless!

It was her honor to have the surname Lin!

A wild girl was a wild girl!

Old Lady Lin slammed the table heavily. “Unfilial son! Kneel down!”

“”Mom, stop acting. If you continue acting like this, Don’t blame your son for not being able to tolerate you.”After saying this, Lin Jincheng turned around and left.”

“Old Lady Lin clutched her chest and staggered a few steps back. If it weren’t for the chair behind her, she would have fallen to the ground.”

It’s reversed!

It’s reversed!

It’s really reversed!

Lin Jincheng actually dared to speak to her like this now.

Old Lady Lin casually grabbed a vase and smashed it on the ground with a bang.

The pieces scattered.

“Zhao shuning walked out from behind. “Mom, I can finally see that fifth brother has been completely bewitched by that Vixen! He can’t even see you, his biological mother!””

“Lin Qingxuan followed behind Zhao shuning and spoke hesitantly, “Mom, actually what Jin Cheng said just now wasn’t unreasonable. After all, eldest niece was raised by fifth sister-in-law. It’s indeed a bit too much for you to ask eldest niece to change her surname...””

Lin Qingxuan wasn’t the kind of person who would be unreasonable.

“From the perspective of a bystander, Old Lady Lin’s request was indeed very unreasonable.”

“Zhao shuning swept a glance over and directly interrupted Lin Qingxuan’s unfinished words. “If you don’t know how to speak, then don’t say it!””

Lin Qingxuan immediately shut up. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Zhao shuning continued to apply the eye ointment on Old Lady Lin.

“Half an hour later, the husband and wife walked out of Old Lady Lin’s bedroom.”

“Lin Qingxuan said in a low voice, “Shuning, Jin City is living with the fifth brother and sister-in-law. What’s with the two of US getting involved? Let’s hurry up and book a plane ticket back to M Nation. Don’t get involved in these matters!””

Zhao shuning rolled his eyes at Lin Qingxuan. “What do you mean? Look at you! I Don’t plan to go back so soon after coming back this time!”

“Then what do you want to Do?”Lin Qingxuan asked.

Zhao shuning had his own plans. “You don’t have to care about that!”

Lin Qingxuan’s expression changed. “Do you have to get involved in the matter between Jin city and the fifth sister-in-law?”

“Zhao shuning turned to look at Lin Qingxuan, his eyes sizing her up. “Lin Qingxuan, let me ask you, are you interested in that Vixen, ye Shu?””

Lin Qingxuan felt that Zhao shuning was being unreasonable. “What nonsense are you talking about?”

“”I think you have a guilty conscience! Open your mouth and shut up, and you’ll be that Vixen! Let me ask you, do you dislike the fact that I can’t have children?”Speaking of excitement.., zhao shuning’s face was a little malevolent. “Lin Laosi, don’t forget! It’s not that I, Zhao shuning, don’t know how to have children! It’s that you don’t have the ability to give birth! All these years, I’ve been taking the blame for you!””

“Hearing this, all the anger on Lin Qingxuan’s face disappeared.”

Yes.

He didn’t have the ability to give birth.

“All these years, it was Zhao shuning who single-handedly blocked those rumors.”

He owed Zhao shuning too much.

“”Shuning, I’m sorry.”Lin Qingxuan sighed. “I don’t have any other intentions towards the fifth sister-in-law. Don’t be angry. In the future, I’ll do whatever you say! I’ll listen to You!””

“Only then was Zhao shuning satisfied. He glanced at Lin Qingxuan. “Come back to my room with me! Tonight, you’ll sleep on the sofa.””

“Okay.”Lin Qingxuan nodded.

On the third floor.

Ye Shu came out of the bathroom after changing.

Lin Jincheng was sitting at his desk and processing some documents.

“Ye Shu stood in front of him and said, “Let me ask you something.””

“You ask.”Lin Jincheng put down the documents and looked up at Ye Shu.
