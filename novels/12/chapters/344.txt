“”I can investigate, but it’s a little troublesome.”Ye Zao stood up to take the computer and hacked into the encrypted website. ”

“In the eyes of outsiders, the tight firewall was solved with a mouse click in ye Zao’s hands. ”

Ye Sen sat behind ye Zao and looked at the constantly changing computer screen. His eyes were almost dazzled.

“After about ten minutes, ye Zao pressed the Enter Key. “It’s Done!” ”

“Did you find it?”Ye Sen was very excited.

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded and switched the page.

“On the computer screen, Bai Wei’s information was displayed. ”

Bai Wei.

Female.

Age 30.

Real name: Li Lanxiang.

Hometown: L City.

Job: KTV Princess.

She dropped out of school at 16 and came to Cloud City. Her first job was in an electronics factory.

“He felt that the wages at the electronics factory were low. After a long period of time, he was introduced to KTV and worked there for 14 years. ”

Ye Sen looked at the information on the computer and his whole body was trembling. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“”Oh right, there’s also this.”Ye Zhuo clicked the mouse and changed the page, then he said, “This Li Yiyi and Li Lanxiang are from the same hometown. They don’t usually have a close relationship! Three months ago, the two of them suddenly moved in together and became roommates. “Uncle, I now suspect that the two of them are colluding.” ”

Ye Sen finally understood why Bai Wei and he had so many common interests.

It turned out.

They were all acting.

The behind-the-scenes director was Li Yiyi.

“After understanding everything, Ye Sen was not so angry anymore. He said in a calm tone, “No need to doubt it. This is the collusion between them.” ”

“What are you going to do now?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“I will break up with Bai Wei immediately!”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “I am relieved to see you like this.”Ye Zhuo was worried that ye Sen would be stuck in this relationship and had the impulse to forgive Bai Wei. ”

Now it seemed that Ye Sen was more decisive than she had imagined.

She also hoped that this experience would teach ye Sen a lesson.

“I’ll go out first.”Ye Sen picked up the car keys.

“Okay.”

“In the living room, when Ye Sen walked past ye Shu, Ye Shu clearly felt that something was wrong. She raised her head to look at Ye Sen and was about to say something when ye Sen’s figure had already left the living room. ”

“Ye Shu quickly went to ye Zao’s room. “Zao, what happened to your uncle?” ”

“Ye Zao closed the computer. “Nothing much. I just saw Bai Wei, no, Li Lanxiang’s real face.” ”

“Who’s Li Lanxiang?”Ye Shu was a little confused.

“Ye Zao said, “Bai Wei is Li Lanxiang.” ”

“What?”Ye Shu was even more confused.

Ye Zao explained the whole process.

“After learning Bai Wei’s real identity, Ye Shu was extremely surprised. “My God! Even Television wouldn’t dare to act like this, right?” ”

Everything was fake.

What was the difference between her and a dummy?

Ye Sen drove to Bai Wei’s address and called Bai Wei.

“When Bai Wei received the call, she was in disbelief. “Hello, Ye Sen, what’s the matter?” ”

“I’m at the entrance of your neighborhood. Come out for a moment.”

“”I’m outside now,”Bai Wei said. ”

“”Then I’ll wait for you.”After saying that, Ye Sen hung up the phone. ”

“Bai Wei said somewhat inexplicably, “What’s wrong with this person?” ”

“Ye Sen called?”Li Yiyi asked from the side.

Bai Wei nodded.

“Li Yiyi frowned. “When you went to the Ye family today, did you offend Ye Sen’s sister?” ”

“”No,”Bai Wei said, “I paid special attention to all aspects. At first, her sister might not like me, but later, I even cooked with her. I feel that she should be quite satisfied with me.” ”

“Bai Wei could talk. When she was cooking, her words were all to please ye Shu. She even said that she would cook for ye Shu every day in the future. ”

She was not pretentious at all.

There shouldn’t be any sister who didn’t like her diligent sister-in-law!

“Therefore, Bai Wei was very confident. ”

Li Yiyi heaved a sigh of relief. “It’s good that you didn’t offend her.”

“Then I’ll go down and take a look first.”

Li Yiyi frowned. “You’re just going to go down like this?”

Bai Wei knew Li Yiyi’s worries. “It’s fine. I just told ye Sen that I’m outside.”

Bai Wei walked all the way to the entrance of the residential area.

She saw ye Sen leaning against the car door and waiting for her.

To be fair.

“Ye Sen was really quite handsome. He gave off the feeling of a tough guy, especially when he was wearing a suit. ”

“Not only was he handsome, but he also had a lot of money. When Bai Wei thought that this man would belong to her completely in the future, she was so excited that she quickly ran over. “Ye Sen.” ”
