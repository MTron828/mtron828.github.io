“Chapter 832: 182: face-smacking, crumbling Baron, No. 1’s terrifying strength! 2”

Translator: 549690339

“Baron stared at the computer screen, frowning. ”

In all of history.

It was the first time he had encountered such a thing in China.

It was too strange.

“If he hadn’t experienced it himself, Baron wouldn’t have believed that it had happened in China. ”

“For Baron, Hacking into a database was a piece of cake. ”

He did not expect to meet an opponent this time.

Who was the person who created this firewall?

“He became famous at the age of 16, and it was now his tenth year as a hacker. He had checked countless information and even hacked into C country’s database. After all, C country’s database had hundreds of firewalls. ”

Security System No. 1 in the world!

“Ever since he hacked into C country’s database, C country had reinforced the firewalls and even issued a bounty on him. ”

“But now, he actually couldn’t hack into the database of a small company in China. ”

Cao Wei looked at his watch.

It was already two minutes more than the ten minutes Baron said.

It seemed that this YC Ye wasn’t a simple streamer.

Who Was She?

“Time passed, and in the blink of an eye, Cao Wei had finished his third cup of coffee. ”

“However, there was still no movement from Baron. Cold sweat even broke out on his forehead. ”

“Cao Wei put down his coffee cup and thought about his words. Then, he said, “Mr. Baron, the noise in the coffee shop will affect your performance. Why Don’t you go back and check again?” ”

It had already been two hours. Cao Wei did not have the time to waste with Baron.

“Baron was currently in high spirits. If he did not hack into the world’s records, he would not let it go. He said without raising his head, “If Mr. Cao is anxious, you can go back first.” ”

He did not believe that he would not be able to go to the records before sunset.

“Being seen through by Baron, Cao Wei was not embarrassed. He said, “Mr. Baron, I’ll be going back first.” ”

“”Okay.”Baron added, “I’ll send you the information on that streamer.” ”

“Then I’ll leave it to Mr. Baron.”

“Cao Wei turned around and left. When he walked to the cashier, he paid for the coffee and ordered a dessert for Baron. ”

“Baron sat in front of the coffee table and tried many ways, but he could not climb over the wall. ”

“The Sun was about to set, and the words on the screen finally changed from 99% to 100% ! ”

Baron could not help but cheer.

It worked!

It finally worked.

“Baron thought he could see the worldwide database, but he did not expect the second firewall to appear in front of him. ”

“Furthermore, there was a line of words on the screen: ”

“”Seeing that you have worked so hard to crack the firewall, Daddy will let you use a backdoor. Next, the main event has just begun. Brother who climbed over the wall, please continue to work hard!” ”

“Baron knew Chinese, so he naturally knew that this sentence was a taunt! ”

It was even more provocative!

He originally thought that he was the one who cracked the first firewall.

He did not expect that the designer had deliberately gone easy on him.

Humiliation!

This was a huge humiliation for the hacker.

Baron’s face turned green and white in anger.

Wait.

He must avenge himself.

“At this moment, Baron suddenly thought of the official website of all under the heaven. ”

“Since he had already been discovered, he might as well make the commotion bigger. ”

“Baron opened the official website of all under the heaven. He planned to open the official website 404 first, and then leave a line of words to retort back. ”

He wanted to let all under the heaven know that he was not someone to be trifled with!

“All of the technical departments of all under the heaven were currently keeping an eye on the database, so there was definitely no one keeping an eye on the official website. ”

He did it right away!

Baron immediately began to operate.

“Normally, he only needed a few seconds to hack a website. ”

“But today, ten minutes had passed, and only half of the progress had been made. ”

“Baron was not in a hurry. He took a bite of his dessert, and the moment he ate it, the originally stable website suddenly became a screen full of code, and then a blue screen. ”

“In the end, the code actually formed two words. ”

Brother!

Baron did not expect that the other party would discover him so quickly and even counterattack.

Baron instantly reacted and wanted to turn off the computer.

But the computer seemed to have lost control and could not be turned off.

“Fuck!”Baron was so angry that he threw the assembled computer on the ground.

PA —

The computer was smashed into pieces.

This sudden sound scared the customers around him even more.

“A waiter in uniform jogged over from the lobby. “Hello Sir, do you need any help?” ” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Baron waved his hand. “No need.”

“The waiter looked at the computer wreckage on the ground and said, “Then I’ll get someone to clean this place up?” ”
