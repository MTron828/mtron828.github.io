Yes.

Lin Jincheng had already thought it through.

He was going to look for ye Shu.

“No matter what happened in the past, he could overthrow it and start over as long as ye Shu could still accept him.”

“Lin Ze raised his head to look at Lin Jincheng. “Dad, do I still have a sister?””

“”Yes.”Lin Jincheng nodded. “Ah Ze, you and your sister are twins. Remember to take good care of your sister in the future.””

“Since he had already decided to look for ye Shu, he would accept everything.”

In the future.

“Her child was his child, the child they shared.”

Twins.

“Lin Ze was a little excited, a little expectant, and a little afraid.”

“He did not know if ye Zhuo would acknowledge him as his older brother, nor did he know if his mother would accept him.”

“Lin Ze followed Lin Jincheng into the car. Lin Jincheng instructed the driver, “Xiao Li, go to the airport.””

“Xiao Li said, “Okay.””

“Lin Ze was stunned. “Dad, what are you going to the airport for?””

“”Your mother is in Yun Jing. Let’s go look for her,”Lin Jincheng replied.”

“Lin Ze continued, “Mother is not in Yun Jing. She is in the capital now.””

“In the capital?”Lin Jincheng was a little surprised.

“Lin Ze continued, “Sister has been admitted to Beijing University.””

“Then where are they living now?”Lin Jincheng hurriedly asked.

Lin Ze frowned slightly.

“This was also a problem that Lin Ze was concerned about. He searched through ye Shu’s information, but could not find the addresses of ye Shu and Ye Zhuo.”

The information seemed to have been deliberately hidden.

“Lin Ze continued, “Let’s go find uncle ye first.””

“Uncle Ye?”

“Lin Ze explained, “Uncle Ye is my mother’s younger brother, ye Sen.”according to seniority, Lin Ze should have called him uncle, but he was used to calling him uncle, so he could not change his words.”

Ye Sen?

“The figure of a young boy immediately appeared in front of Lin Jincheng. When he met Ye Shu, Ye Sen was only thirteen years old.”

“Then where is your Uncle Now?”Lin Jincheng asked.

“Lin Ze continued, “Dad, I think we should clarify things before we go to find uncle. For example, does my mother know about my existence? In the letter, you clearly said that you were going to look for my mother. Why did you break your promise again? Also, your name. Also, do you know about your sister’s existence? How did I return to your side? Why am I the only one by your and Grandma’s side while my sister is not?””

“”I secretly went to Yun Jing to look for my mother before. At that time, I didn’t know that Uncle Ye was my uncle. My uncle told me that my mother was a very strong person. Unfortunately, when I was young, I met someone unladylike and was cheated by someone. She even gave birth to a daughter out of wedlock! A daughter out of wedlock. This means that my mother never knew of my existence! “How did I leave my mother’s side at that time? “Why didn’t my mother know of my existence?””

“After saying this, Lin Ze continued:”

“”Moreover, my mother hasn’t remarried all these years. She’s been living a very difficult life! If we don’t figure out all these things, not only will my mother not forgive us, even my own face will be too ashamed to see my mother.””

“Just like what Old Lady Lin said, how many nineteen years could there be in life?”

But Ye Shu gave the best nineteen years of her life to Lin Jincheng.

“Ye Shu had waited for Lin Jincheng alone with her child for so many years, but Lin Jincheng had not even shown up once.”

“Without a reasonable explanation, no matter who it was, they might not be able to forgive Lin Jincheng.”

“What Lin Ze said made a lot of sense. It turned out that unknowingly, the child from back then had already grown up.”

“Lin Jincheng was silent for a moment. After a while, he looked up at the driver. “Xiao Li, let’s go to the bustling place first.””

The bustling place was a temporary residence for Lin Jincheng.

“There were some things that were not convenient to talk about in the car. He had to find a place and tell Lin Ze the details of what happened 19 years ago. Then, the father and son would think of a way to seek ye Shu’s forgiveness.” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

As for the child’s matter...

“Lin Jincheng planned to keep this matter in his stomach forever. He believed that Ye Shu was definitely innocent. In the future, she would be his daughter, Lin Ze’s only sister.”

Lin Jincheng only regretted that he did not wake up earlier.

“If he could wake up earlier, he would not have wasted more than a year’s time.”

The car sped up.

...

On the other side.

The Feng family.

“The auspicious hour had arrived, but Lin Jincheng had not come to pick Feng Qianhua up.”

The guests of the Feng family were discussing in low voices.

Feng Qianhua had waited for Lin Jincheng for nineteen years.

“There had been no news for nineteen years. The two families had suddenly decided to get engaged. The auspicious hour had arrived, but the groom-to-be had not come. This was somewhat intriguing.”
