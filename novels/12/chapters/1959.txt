“Actually, Xu Yao was also a little worried. What if he ziteng really made it through? ” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“But when she thought of the Doctor’s words, she felt relieved again. ”

So what if he really made it through!

“If he really made it through, he ziteng would only be a cripple. ”

“Thinking of this, Xu Yao heaved a sigh of relief. ”

“He’s mother continued, “Yaoyao, you’re still pregnant. Even if you don’t think about yourself, you have to think about the child in your belly. The first three months are the most critical period. Go back and rest! Don’t let your uncle and I worry about you!” ”

“Hearing this, Xu Yao said hesitantly, “But...” ”

“No buts. Go back and rest. Pregnant women are more lethargic than ordinary people. It’s not good to endure this.”Mother he held Xu Yao’s arm. “I’ll send you back.”

“Helpless, Xu Yao could only agree. She continued, “Auntie, if anything happens, you must tell me immediately!” ”

“Okay.”Mother he nodded with reddened eyes.

“After sending Xu Yao to the ward, mother he returned to the ICU entrance. ”

“Seeing her come over, father he turned around and asked, “Have you sent Yaoyao Back?” ”

“Yes.”Mother he nodded. “I hope that Ziteng can survive tonight safely.”

“Father he held mother he’s hand tightly, “It’s okay. Ziteng will definitely be fine. Have you forgotten? The year you gave birth to ziteng, there was a master who came to our house to seek refuge. He said that there was a great calamity in our Ziteng’s life. As long as we can survive this calamity, we will be rich and successful in the future. We will be able to live a peaceful and smooth life!” ”

“Yes.”Mother he nodded.

“In the following period of time, the husband and wife comforted each other until the doctor went to work the next morning. ”

“”Doctor, doctor! My son was fine last night. Does that mean that he’s fine and can come out of the ICU?” ”

“The attending doctor nodded. “But don’t be too happy. Although the patient is temporarily out of danger, it doesn’t mean that he’s fine!” ”

The rest was self-evident.

“In fact, sometimes, it was better to die than to be in a vegetative state. ”

“Father he smiled. “It’s fine, it’s fine. As long as I’m alive, it’s fine.”If he was alive, he could at least see a little light and brightness. ”

“The doctor looked at father he and said, “You’re right. As long as I’m alive, I can see Hope.” ”

“After coming out of the Doctor’s office, father he rushed to Xu Yao’s ward. ”

“Xunfang! Yaoyao!”

“Seeing father he like this, Xu Yao narrowed her eyes. He ziteng was definitely dead. ”

“Otherwise, father he wouldn’t be so flustered. ”

“Mother he immediately stood up and asked, “What did the Doctor Say? Is Ziteng Okay?” ”

Father he hurriedly nodded. “He’s fine! The Doctor said that Ziteng is temporarily out of danger!”

“That’s good.”Mother he cried tears of joy.

Out of danger?

How could this be?

How could he ziteng be out of danger!

“Xu Yao suppressed the thoughts in her heart and looked at father he. She continued, “Uncle, when will that Ziteng wake up?” ”

“Hearing this, father he was stunned. He did not know how to speak. ”

“Seeing this, Xu Yao had an idea. The stone in her heart also fell to the ground. ”

“”Uncle, hurry up and say it!”Xu Yao urged anxiously. ”

“Father he sighed. This kind of thing could not be hidden from Xu Yao. He continued, “Although Ziteng’s life is no longer in danger, he won’t wake up for the time being. The Doctor said that he will become a vegetable in the future...” ”

Xu Yao’s eyes reddened again.

“Seeing this, mother he immediately added, “Yaoyao, don’t worry. Ziteng will be fine! Miss Ye will definitely have a way to cure Ziteng!” ”

“Hearing this, father he immediately nodded in agreement. “Yes, yes, yes. Yaoyao, don’t worry. Previously, a fortune teller had read Ziteng’s fortune. He said that as long as ziteng survives this calamity, he will be safe and sound for the rest of his life.” ”

“At this moment, Ye Zhuo, whom they had never met before, became the spiritual sustenance of the He family’s parents. ”

They believed that ye Zhuo would definitely be able to cure he ziteng.

Miss Ye?

Who Was Miss Ye?

“Xu Yao knitted her brows without leaving a trace and reached out to hold mother he’s hand. “Auntie, can miss ye really cure Ziteng?” ”

“Yes! Definitely!”Mother he nodded firmly.

“Xu Yao continued, “Then let’s invite Miss ye over now!” ”

Mother he shook her head. “Not now. We still have to wait!”

“”Why?”Xu Yao said, “Ziteng is like this now. The earlier he is treated, the more hope he has! We have to invite Miss ye over quickly. We can’t delay any longer!” ”

“Mother he sighed. “Your uncle and I also want to invite Miss ye over as soon as possible, but Miss Ye is too busy. She’s not free now.” ”

“How can this be!”Xu Yao was very anxious.

“Mother he continued, “Yaoyao, don’t be anxious. Ziteng will definitely be able to hold on until Miss Ye arrives.” ”

“Okay.”Xu Yao nodded. “I believe in him.”

“In the afternoon, he ziteng was transferred to the normal ward. ”

The normal ward allowed family members to accompany him.

“The He family’s parents held onto he ziteng’s hand tightly. “Ziteng, can you hear us? Ziteng, you have to be strong! You have to be strong, understand?” ”

“Although he ziteng was unconscious and could not open his eyes, he did not even have the strength to move his fingers, but his consciousness was very clear. ”

“He knew that he had been in a car accident, and he knew that he might become a vegetable in the future. ”

“When he heard his parents’voices, he desperately wanted to respond, but he could not say a word. ”

“He could only answer his parents in his heart. ‘Dad, Mom, don’t worry, I will be strong. No matter what, I will never give up on myself!’ ”

“At this moment, a voice sounded in the air again. ”

“”Ziteng, I have good news for you. We have a baby. I’m pregnant. You’re going to be a father! Open your eyes and take a look at me, okay?” ”

It was Xu Yao’s voice.

“He ziteng tried hard to open his eyes, but he couldn’t. ”

“In a moment, he ziteng felt that something was wrong. ”

Didn’t he already know that Xu Yao was pregnant?

But he didn’t think too much about it.

“Xu Yao continued, “Ziteng, don’t worry. No matter what, the baby and I will never give up on you. We will wait for you to wake up!” ”

He ziteng was extremely touched.

He knew that he didn’t choose the wrong person.

Xu Yao was worthy of his love.

“After saying that, Xu Yao said again, “Ziteng, I’m sorry. I’m the one who let you down. If I didn’t want to drink milk tea, you wouldn’t have gotten into a car accident...” ”

Xu Yao’s tone was filled with self-blame.

She was the one who let he ziteng down.

“Hearing Xu Yao’s self-blame and hearing her sobbing voice, he ziteng’s heart ached. ”

He didn’t blame Xu Yao.

He had never blamed Xu Yao.

“If he had to blame someone, he should blame himself. ”

He shouldn’t have driven so fast.

This matter had nothing to do with Xu Yao.

“He wanted to comfort Xu Yao, but he couldn’t say a word. ”

This feeling was very uncomfortable.

“He wasn’t really going to lie on the bed forever, was he? ”

“At this moment, another voice suddenly sounded in the air, “Yaoyao, don’t cry. It’s not good for the baby if you keep crying like this. I don’t want you to do this. This is Ziteng’s life! You Didn’t know that something would happen to ziteng!” ”

It was his mother’s voice.

He Ziteng was extremely shocked when he heard this voice.

“From his mother’s tone, it was obvious that she had completely accepted Xu Yao. ”

That’s great!

That’s great!

He ziteng had never expected that he would be able to see his mother and Xu Yao coexist peacefully in his lifetime. They were like mother and daughter.

It seemed that his injuries were not in vain!

“Thinking of this, he ziteng was a little happy. ”

“Xu Yao said, “It’s my fault, it’s all my fault! Auntie, don’t Make Excuses for me. This is all my fault, why do I have to drink milk tea!” ”

“Mother he hugged Xu Yao, “Yaoyao, don’t be like this. Your uncle and I don’t blame you. Don’t take all the responsibility on yourself. The Doctor said that you can’t have too many emotional fluctuations now. It’s not good for the baby. Even if it’s for the baby, you have to be happy.” ”

Xu Yao nodded and tried her best to smile.

“In the blink of an eye, another three days passed. ”

“Although it was only three days, the injury on Xu Yao’s head had recovered a lot. ”

“In the afternoon, she walked back from the hospital garden and saw an uninvited guest in the ward. ”

Mi Chen!

Why is Mi Chen Here?

Xu Yao was very surprised.

Could it be...

The He family’s parents had discovered something?

“Xu Yao stopped in her tracks and stood behind the door, eavesdropping on the conversation in the room. ”

“Father he said, “Doctor Mi, you were the doctor that ziteng trusted the most in the past. In the future, I’ll have to trouble you to run to the hospital more often!” ”

“Mi Chen had very deep attainments in medicine. She had even saved mother he’s life previously. The He family’s parents trusted him very much, so they had invited him over to assist he ziteng’s attending physician. ”

“”Old Mister He, what are you talking about? I’m a doctor. It’s my responsibility to seek medical advice. This is what I should do.”Mi Chen was still as gentle and refined as ever. ”

He and Xu Yao were the same kind of people.

They were good at disguising themselves and eating people without spitting out their bones.

“Father he continued, “In your opinion, does Ziteng still have a chance to wake up?” ”
