Translator: 549690339

Bai Jingshu was a little worried. “You really don’t need to go after him?”

“No need.”

Bai Jingshu didn’t say anything else.

“”Oh right, where’s Xiao Lin? Did you send him back to the hotel?”Elder Bai asked in return. ”

“Yes.”Bai Jingshu nodded.

“Elder bai continued, “You don’t have to take your great-aunt’s words to heart. Even if the entire world doesn’t support you and Xiao Lin, grandfather supports you. You guys should boldly move forward. If anything really happens, grandfather will be there to support you!”! “Grandfather is the same as you. I believe that Xiao Lin won’t disappoint anyone.” ”

Elder Bai had already missed out on this once when he was young. He didn’t want Bai Jingshu to repeat the same mistake and follow in his footsteps.

There was only one life.

“If one missed out on the most beautiful and best person, there would be no turning back. ”

“After hearing elder Bai’s words, Bai Jingshu was a little touched. She held onto elder Bai’s arm and said, “Thank you, grandfather.” ”

It was hard to imagine how she would have walked this path without elder Bai’s support.

“What a silly child.”Elder Bai shook his head helplessly.

“Elder bai continued, “Jingshu, have you talked to Lin Ze about the future?” ”

“”Yes, we have.”Bai Jingshu nodded. ”

“When do you plan to Get Married?”Elder Bai continued to ask. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

He was old and didn’t have much time left. He had to see Bai Jingshu get married and escape the control of his crazy parents.

Get Married?

Bai Jingshu was stunned when elder Bai suddenly asked her about this topic.

“What? Lin Ze has never talked about marriage with you?”Elder Bai frowned. “Didn’t he want to get married with you?”

“If that was the case, then there was no need for Bai Jingshu and Lin Ze to continue. ”

The great man once said that any relationship that did not aim to get married was a hooligan.

“”No, no.”Seeing that elder Bai had misunderstood, Bai Jingshu quickly explained, “He mentioned it, but I think we should get to know each other better for a while and not continue this topic.” ”

“”I see.”Elder bai heaved a sigh of relief and nodded, then, he continued, “Jingshu, you’re not young anymore. There are quite a number of young ladies your age who have gotten married and had children. Lin Ze is a rare and good man. Although his birth is a little bad, this hinders his excellence. I feel that the two of you can discuss marriage next.” ”

“So Soon?”Bai Jingshu looked at elder Bai in surprise.

“”Isn’t that fast?”Elder bai smiled and said, “Back then, your grandmother and I got married less than a month ago!” ”

“Although there was no love in this marriage, the two of them got along well in the days that followed. They treated each other with respect. ”

“After that, elder Bai continued, “You two have known each other for more than a year, right?” ”

“Yes.”Bai Jingshu nodded.

“”I see that the eighth day of next month will be very good.”The corners of Old Master Bai’s mouth curled up into a smile. “How about this, you get Xiao Lin to come over tomorrow.” ”

The eighth day of next month?

“”Grandfather, isn’t it a little too fast?”Bai Jingshu asked. ”

“”Not too fast, not too fast.”Old Master Bai waved his hand. “I don’t want it to be too late.” ”

On the other side.

“Bai Sanfeng left the old residence in anger. No matter how she thought about it, she felt terrible. Bai Jingshu was her niece who she had watched grow up. She treated Bai Jingshu the same way she treated her own granddaughter. Now that Bai Jingshu was in such a predicament.., bai Sanfeng felt both distressed and angry. ”

“”Great-aunt.”At this moment, a pleasant female voice suddenly appeared in the air. ”

“Bai Sanfeng raised her head and said with a smile, “It’s Miss Mo!” ”

“Bai Mo walked over and held Bai Sanfeng’s hand intimately. “Great-aunt, did you come from grandfather’s Place?” ”

“Yes.”Bai Sanfeng nodded.

“Bai Mo narrowed her eyes and continued, “You must be here for sister Jingshu’s matter, right?” ”

Bai Sanfeng didn’t say anything.

“Bai Mo was like a shrewd person. Seeing Bai Sanfeng like this, she knew that she must have suffered a loss at Old Master Bai’s place, she sighed and said, “Actually, I also feel that Lin Ze isn’t good enough for sister Jingshu. I’ve tried to persuade Sister Jingshu many times before, but sister Jingshu... ... sigh, I don’t know how to put it. It seems that she has her eyes set on Lin Ze. No matter what I say, she won’t listen.” ”

“At this point, Bai Mo paused, she continued, “Great-aunt, there are some things that the person in the middle is confused, while the bystander is clear. No matter how clear we see it, it’s useless if sister Jingshu can’t see the true nature of it. Good advice is hard to hear. No matter how much we say now, it’s not only futile, but to sister Jingshu, it’s also bad! “So, there are some things that are better left unsaid. When she experiences it personally and regrets it, she will naturally understand your kindness.” ”
