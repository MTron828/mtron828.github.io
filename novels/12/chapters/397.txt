Translator: 549690339

“Fortunately, there was a police car at the back, so Mu Yourong did not fall to the ground in a sorry state. ”

How could this damned old woman be Cen Fifth Master’s grandmother?

Wasn’t the Cen family already bankrupt?

What on Earth was going on?

Was she dreaming? Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Yes, she was definitely dreaming! ”

“Mu Yourong did not want to believe the scene in front of her, but the scene in front of her was real and real. ”

Cen Shaoqing held on to Old Madam Cen’s arm as they walked out the door.

Old Madam Cen shook off Cen Shaoqing’s hand in disgust. “I’m not so old that I can’t walk anymore! You Don’t have to help me!”

She was not old!

She was still young!

Cen Shaoqing had no choice but to give up and follow old madam Cen with the prayer beads in his hands.

“Mu Yourong lay limply in the police car, her entire body trembling, her face devoid of any color. ”

“Old Lady Cen deliberately looked in Mu Yourong’s direction, the corners of her mouth curling into a smile. ”

“Without even thinking about it, she knew that Mu Yourong would definitely be so regretful that her intestines would turn green. ”

Picking up a sesame seed and throwing away a watermelon.

How could she not be regretful?

She just liked to see Mu Yourong regretful.

She would be happy as much as Mu Yourong regretted it!

Old Lady Cen even wanted to buy a string of firecrackers to celebrate.

“At this moment, Mu Yourong understood. ”

The CEN family did not go bankrupt.

Everything was fake.

The Cen family had deliberately created this to test her!

CEN fifth master was the CEN Fifth Master!

They were fiancées!

“When she thought of everything that had happened, Mu Yourong’s face became paler and paler. Even her lips did not have the slightest bit of color. It was even worse than being dead. ”

Just what stupid thing had she done!

She had actually broken off the engagement between her and fifth Master Cen!

“If she had not proposed to break off the engagement, then she would already be the Cen family’s young Madam! ”

“If she had known that old Madam Cen was the Cen Shaoqing’s grandmother, she would definitely have treated old madam Cen as her ancestor! ”

“At this moment, Mu Yourong wished she could slap her previous self to death. ”

No Way!

Fifth Master Cen was her fiancé.

Fifth Master Cen was hers!

No one could snatch him away!

“Thinking of this, Mu Yourong immediately chased after her and grabbed Old Lady Cen’s arm, she cried, “Grandma, I’m Sorry! I’m sorry! It was all my fault, I didn’t do it on purpose! Please forgive me! Please forgive me! I will properly honor you in the future!” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen didn’t expect Mu Yourong to be so shameless. She was stunned for a moment, then she fiercely shook off Mu Yourong’s hand. “Who’s your grandma? ! Shameless!” ”

“Mu Yourong was thrown to the ground, then she crawled over and grabbed Cen Shaoqing’s clothes. ”

“Cen Shaoqing had already expected her to do this. He took a few steps back, and Mu Yourong missed him. ”

“Fifth Master!”Mu Yourong lay on the ground and raised her head to look at Cen Shaoqing. “Fifth Master! I’m your fiancée! You Can’t abandon me! The engagement between our two families has long been set! You Can’t go back on your word!”

That’s right!

The engagement was set long ago by the elders of the two families.

“No matter what, Cen Shaoqing could not abandon her! ”

She had to defend her marriage.

Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly.

“He had seen countless people in his life, but this was the first time he had seen someone as unscrupulous as MU yourong. ”

“Old Madam Cen was stunned by Mu Yourong’s shamelessness. Standing in front of Cen Shaoqing, she pointed at Mu Yourong and cursed: ”

“Scum! White Lotus Flower! Why Are You So Shameless? You actually have the cheek to say that you are our Shaoqing’s fiancée! Ah Pui! Why Don’t you take a piss and take a look at yourself! How can someone like you be worthy of our Shaoqing? Why didn’t you think of today when you looked down on others with your dog eyes? Now You Remember? It’s Too Late!”

“Mu Yourong looked at Old Mrs. Cen with tears streaming down her face, “Grandma, it was all my fault in the past. Please forgive me! I didn’t want to break off the engagement! This, this was all my parents’idea! It was them who despised the poor and loved the rich, it was them! It was all their fault! It had nothing to do with me!” ”

Yes!

It was all their fault!

It was all soldier Mu and Shen Rong’s fault!

They were the ones who looked down on the Cen Family First.

Two idiots!

Then they were two idiots!

“If they had not insisted on breaking off the engagement, she would already be the young madam of the Cen Family! ”

Old Madam Cen was speechless. She had no words to describe mu yourong.

“”Shaoqing, let’s Go! Ignore this disgusting person!” ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and followed old madam Cen’s footsteps.

“Mu Yourong immediately chased after her, “No! Grandma, You Can’t Leave! Please forgive me!” ”

But Old Mrs. Cen did not give her the chance at all.

She closed the car door.

The driver started the engine.
