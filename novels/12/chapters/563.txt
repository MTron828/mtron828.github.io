Old Lady Lin lowered her head to look at Ye Shu and sighed. “When will you be able to change this child’s problem of kindness?”

Feng Qianhua was too kind.

She wasn’t willing to fuss over anything with others.

“In this world, who wouldn’t be willing to pick a soft persimmon to pinch? ”

“”It’s a blessing to be at a disadvantage.”Feng Qianhua smiled. “Anyway, please promise me.” ”

“Zhao shuning said, “Qianhua, you’re just too easy to talk to! If I Were you, I definitely wouldn’t forgive that Vixen!” ”

“If ye Shu dared to snatch her man, she would tear ye Shu apart! ”

“Feng Qianqian sniffed. “Mom, are you really alright?” ”

Feng Qianhua shook her head. “I’m really alright.”

“Old Madam Lin looked at Feng Xianxian. “Xianxian, don’t be like your mother in the future. In this world, people should be more selfish! Look at how kind your mother is. How much has she been bullied?” ”

“Feng Xianxian smiled and shook her head, “Grandma, I’m not afraid of being bullied! “My mother said that in this world, there are good people and bad people. We have to live according to our hearts and live with a clear conscience! “No matter what, we just have to live up to our conscience!” ”

Old Madam Lin Sighed again and looked at Feng Qianhua. “Look at what you’ve done to the child.”

She looked at Feng Qianxian and then thought about ye Zhuo.

Old Madam Lin was filled with anger again.

“Ye Zhuo had been back for a few days, but he did not take the initiative to visit her in this courtyard. ”

Having that granddaughter was the same as not having that granddaughter!

Both mother and daughter were bitches!

“It was one thing for them to be cheap, but they still had to lead Lin Ze Astray. ”

“Originally, Lin Ze was a very obedient and filial child. ”

“Ever since the mother and daughter returned, Lin Ze had completely changed. Last time, he even dared to quibble with her! ”

“If it was in the past, Lin Ze would not have been like this at all. ” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“There was an old saying that people were not familiar with other people’s children. If it were her, it would become her own grandson and granddaughter. ”

“Feng Qianhua smiled and said, “Aunt Lin, I think Xianxian is right to think that way!”After saying that, Feng Qianhua continued, “Oh right, it’s getting late. Xianxian and I will go back first! We will come back to see you tomorrow!” ”

“Old Mrs. Lin held Feng Qianhua’s hand with a guilty look. “Qianhua, I’ve made you suffer today!” ”

“It’s okay.”Feng Qianhua smiled. “As long as you promise not to cause trouble for sister Ye Shu.”

Old Mrs. Lin nodded and personally sent Feng Qianhua and Feng Xianxian out with Zhao shuning.

“After sending the two of them out, she turned around and returned. ”

“Zhao shuning helped old Mrs. Lin into the house. “Mom, I think ye Shu and her daughter really can’t stay in our Lin family anymore! If this goes on, Qianhua will be bullied to death, won’t she?” ”

Old Mrs. Lin furrowed her brows tightly.

“Zhao shuning continued, “I think ye Zhuo is still quite pretty. Why don’t we find another family to marry her off!”Speaking up to this point, Zhao shuning sighed with a troubled expression. “I just don’t know if ye Shu will agree to it or not?” ”

“Hearing this, Old Madam Lin was like a cat whose tail had been stepped on. She said angrily, “Disagree? My granddaughter belongs to our Lin Family! I say what must be done! What right does that slut have to disagree?” ”

“Zhao shuning’s eyes rolled around, “So, you agree with me?” ”

“”I agree!”Old Madam Lin nodded. Since the Little Slut was disobedient, she should marry off. “But I don’t have a suitable family for the time being.” ”

“Zhao shuning smiled and said, “The Li family in the east of the city is not bad! I heard that the head of the Li family is thinking of marrying a second wife recently!” ”

The Li family in the east of the city?

Old Madam Lin thought about it for a long time before she thought of such a person.

The head of the Li family was called Li Yibiao.

Li Yibiao was in his forties this year and had a son and a daughter.

The son was 15 years old and the daughter was 8 years old.

The son was born to his first wife and the daughter was born to his third wife.

“Perhaps he was born with a life that was harmful to his wife. Li Yibiao had married four wives before and after, and all of them died long ago. ”

“Therefore, rumors spread that Li Yibiao had a special hobby. ”

There were also people who said that his four wives were actually tortured to death by Li Yibiao.

“Thinking of this, Old Lady Lin frowned. ”

“Zhao shuning saw the hesitation in Old Lady Lin’s eyes and continued, “But the head of the Li family should forget about it! No matter what, Ye Zhuo is the bloodline of our Lin family. Marrying into the Li family is indeed a grievance for ye Zhuo!” ”

Zhao shuning specially emphasized the word ‘Ye’.

This was to emphasize to Old Lady Lin that Ye Shu’s surname was ye and not Lin.
