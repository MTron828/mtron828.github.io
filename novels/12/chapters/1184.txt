Lin Zhaoyang’s voice came from the other end of the phone. “I have already gone to the Lin family. Zhao Xueyin has also taken the bracelet.”.

“Hearing this, Old Master Jin’s stern face finally revealed a smile. “Good! That’s great! Special Assistant Lin, it’s been hard on you.” ”

“Although he already knew what kind of person Zhao Xueyin was, Old Master Jin was still very happy to hear Lin Zhaoyang’s words. ”

“Zhao Xueyin kept the bracelet. Not only could it prove that his plan was sound, but it was also very feasible. ”

“”It should be done.”Special Assistant Lin’s voice sounded again. “Old Master Jin, what should I do next?” ”

Old Master Jin narrowed his eyes. “There’s no hurry for the next thing. Take your time. Wait for me to send you a message.”

“Okay.”

“After saying this, Old Master Jin hung up the phone. ”

“Uncle Fu stood by the side and said with a smile, “Master, Congratulations.” ”

Old Master Jin waved his hand. “It’s just the beginning. Ruyu is too guarded against me. He has to see Zhao Xueyin’s true side before he will believe the truth.”

Uncle Fu nodded. “You’re right.”

“After a while, Old Master Jin looked out of the French window and sighed deeply, “I’m also responsible for the consequences! If I didn’t hurt Ruyu back then, he wouldn’t hate me to this day!” ”

Old Master Jin regretted what happened back then.

It was a pity.

“There were all kinds of medicine in this world, but there was no medicine for regret. ”

“”Karma, this is my retribution!”Old Master Jin hammered his chest. “Retribution! It’s retribution!” ”

“The heavenly axiom was good for reincarnation, but Karma wasn’t good! ”

“Seeing Old Master Jin like this, uncle Fu sighed deeply. “Master, don’t think like this! Things are over, let it be!” ”

No one could tell if what happened back then was real or fake.

Old Master Jin was at fault.

Even Si lui was at fault.

Old Master Jin’s face was filled with regret and guilt. “There are some things that I can’t let go of just because I don’t want to.”

“Uncle Fu smiled. “Master, I believe that young master will come to his senses this time.” ”

“I hope so.”Old Master Jin sighed.

“”Definitely.”Uncle Fu’s gaze was very determined. After saying that, uncle fu continued, “Oh right, master, the Lotus Mist you ordered a few days ago has arrived. Do you want to go take a look?” ”

The Lotus Mist was a fruit from the tropical regions. It wasn’t available this season.

Master Jin’s Lotus Mist was ordered overseas.

“Let’s go take a look.”Master Jin nodded.

...

On the other side.

Si Lui had just arrived home.

He saw Yang Wenhao waiting for him at the door.

“”Brother Yu, you’re back!”Yang Wenhao continued, “How is it? How is the collaboration between you and Qian Zhuo?” ”

“At the mention of Qian Zhuo, Si Lui’s eyes were filled with malice. ”

If it wasn’t for Qian Zhuo...

Zhao Xueyin wouldn’t have been bullied by Ye Zhuo for nothing.

Si lui raised his head to look at Yang Wenhao. “Do you know?”

“”Know?”Yang Wenhao asked with a puzzled expression, “Know what?” ”

“Don’t pretend.”Si Lui’s expression was a little cold. “Did you collude with Ye Zhuo?”

This matter definitely had something to do with Yang Wenhao. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“After all, from the very beginning, Yang Wenhao had been filled with hostility towards Zhao Xueyin. ”

“He hated Zhao Xueyin so much, so why would he be so kind as to introduce her to Qian You? ”

This was clearly a collusion between Yang Wenhao and ye Zhuo.

The two of them colluded and deliberately humiliated Zhao Xueyin!

“Yang Wenhao looked at Si lui with a dumbfounded expression. “Brother Yu, what are you talking about? Why Don’t I understand? What do you mean by colluding with Miss Ye? What did I collude with her for? I don’t even know Miss Ye, how can I collude with her?” ”

“Stop talking.”Si Lu’s voice was very cold. “Just take it that I misjudged you. I Won’t have a friend like you in the future!”

Break Up?

Did Si Lu mean to break up with him?

But he didn’t do anything. Why would si lu break up with him for no reason?

What a joke.

Si Lu would definitely be joking with him.

“”Alright Brother Yu, stop joking! Quickly tell me, did you guys see Qian you today? What does Qian you look like? Is She Really Beautiful?”Although he had worked with Qian you before.., yang Wenhao had never seen her before. He had only heard Rebecca talk about her. ”

She said that she was a rare beauty.

“Hearing Yang Wenhao’s words, Si Lui’s eyes were filled with ridicule. ”

She was pretending.

She was still pretending.

“In fact, Yang Wenhao just wanted to express that not only was ye Zao talented, he was also beautiful? ”
