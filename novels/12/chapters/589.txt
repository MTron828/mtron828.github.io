“When ye Zhuo was eating dessert, she basically did not pay attention to the outside world. ”

“By the time she reacted, she was already sitting on Cen Shaoqing’s lap. She simply did not move and continued eating dessert. ”

It was a very pleasing scene.

“Cen Yuyan gritted her teeth as she watched, afraid that song Chenyu would be angry. ”

“Fortunately, Prime Minister song Chenyu was able to hold a boat in his stomach, so there was no special expression on his face. ”

“Song Chenyu walked to the table with a drink in his hand and said with a smile, “Miss Ye, I heard that you are a signed streamer of Xing Tianxia Culture Co. , Ltd. ?” ”

“En.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Song Chenyu continued, “I’m quite familiar with your company’s CEO Li. If you encounter any problems at work that are inconvenient for you to speak about, you can tell me. I’ll help you pass the message to CEO Li. I believe that on account of me, CEO Li will definitely not make things difficult for you.” ”

“Even if ye Zhuo was famous in the broadcasting industry, she was only a small streamer. ”

Song Chenyu was indirectly telling ye Zhuo this. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The difference between a celebrity and an online celebrity.

“A celebrity could be friends with her superior, but she could not. ”

“Sometimes, a casual conversation with Li Shang could affect ye Zhuo’s resources and even end his career as a streamer. ”

CEO Li.

Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly.

“Song Chenyu should be talking about Li Shang, right? ”

“Thank you.”Ye Zao was too lazy to explain.

“Song Chenyu said softly, “Miss Ye, you’re too polite. It’s just a small matter.” ”

Ye Zao did not say anything else and continued eating dessert.

“Song Chenyu wanted to say something else, but seeing ye Zao like this, she could only shut up and walk to Cen Yuyan’s side. ”

“Is it good?”Cen Shaoqing whispered into her ear and asked.

“Have a taste?”Ye Zao scooped a spoonful and handed it to Cen Shaoqing’s mouth.

Cen Shaoqing was stunned for a moment. He opened his mouth and took it. The dim light in the private room covered his expression.

This...

Was this considered an indirect kiss?

“After being together with ye Zao for so long, the biggest measure between them was to hold hands and then hug. ”

Other than that unexpected kiss.

There was no formal kiss between the two of them.

“Is it delicious?”Ye Zao raised his head and asked.

“Cen Shaoqing held back the impulse in his heart. He opened his thin lips slightly and said in a low and hoarse voice, “It’s very sweet.” ”

“One more bite?”Ye Zao handed another spoonful to his mouth.

“Cen Shaoqing opened his mouth and took it. His heartbeat suddenly accelerated, and the blood in his body boiled along with it. His broad palm pressed against ye Zao’s waist, getting hotter and hotter. ”

“After a moment, he let go of her and said in a low voice, “I’m going to the bathroom.” ”

It was a very low voice.

It was as if he was suppressing something.

“Go.”Ye Zao only had dessert in his eyes and ignored Cen Shaoqing’s abnormality.

Cen Shaoqing got up and walked to the bathroom.

“Once he left, the atmosphere in the entire private room became relaxed. ”

“After about half an hour, Cen Shaoqing came back and sat next to Ye Zao. ”

“This time, he didn’t dare to mess around. He didn’t even dare to look at ye Zao again. He counted the Buddha beads while reciting the clear heart mantra. ”

“Cen Yuyan looked over and tugged at song Chenyu’s sleeve. She lowered her voice and said, “Chenyu, look at them.” ”

“What’s Wrong?”

“Cen Yuyan’s eyes flashed with pride. She said in a low voice, “Ye Zao must have offended my fifth brother in some way!” ”

“What do you mean?”

“CEN Yuyan said, “Look, the two of them were hugging just now. Now my fifth brother can’t even be bothered to look at her! This shows that my fifth brother doesn’t have her in his heart at all. He’s just acting for the occasion.” ”

“Song Chenyu narrowed his eyes, he said with a smile, “After all, Miss Ye is still young. It’s inevitable for her to have differences with fifth master in her outlook on life. However, as a young couple, it’s normal for them to occasionally have differences in their minds. A husband and wife quarrel, a quarrel at the head of the bed, and a quarrel at the end of the bed.” ”

Cen Shaoqing was thirty-one years old this year.

Ye Zhuo was only nineteen years old.

“Whether it was in terms of talent or experience, she could not be compared to CEN Shaoqing. ”

“As a little girl, in order to highlight her personality, she would more or less have a little temper. ”

She would be coquettishly pouting.

“However, for a man as noble as Cen Shaoqing, he had long passed the age where he liked coquettishly pouting little girls. He also did not like little girls who acted in a little temper. ”

“Therefore, if ye Zhuo wanted to act like a little girl in front of him... ”

It was obviously a big mistake.

“However, there was one thing that surprised song Chenyu. ”

Ye Zhuo actually practiced racing in order to please Cen Shaoqing.

“Moreover, his driving skills were so good. ”

“This meant that besides being cute and pouty, she also had other advantages that attracted men. ”

“If she were a man, she would definitely not like a girl like Ye Zhuo. ”
