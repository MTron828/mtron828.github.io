Translator: 549690339

She had no way to deal with Ye Zhuo.

But she always had a way to deal with ye Shu!

“On what basis did the mother and daughter pair live their lives in such a hurry, while she got worse and worse? ”

The mother pays the debt!

“She wanted ye Shu to become a promiscuous cousin, to be disgraced in the Yun capital! ”

“When she thought of this, Mu Yourong felt extremely happy! ”

“With a ruined mother like ye Shu, she wouldn’t have the face to live in this world compared to Ye Zao, right? ”

Serve?

Even take photos?

The amount of information mu Yourong’s words contained was simply too much!

The assistant was stunned.

“If she remembered correctly, Ye Shu was Mu Yourong’s foster mother. ”

They had been mother and daughter in the past.

Mu Yourong’s actions were truly venomous.

“But she was only an assistant. She could only do as Mu Yourong instructed. “Yes, miss, I understand.” ”

“MU yourong continued, “Remember to find more people. Ye Shu has been a widow for many years, so he must be thinking too hard.” ”

“The assistant nodded, feeling that this Mu Yourong was somewhat terrifying. ”

“”Alright, go make the arrangements.” ”

“Then I’ll go out first. Call me if you need anything.”The assistant nodded and walked out.

...

12 pm.

Ye Shu finished the finishing work at the restaurant and walked home.

“Actually, she could usually reach home around 11:30 pm. ”

“But today’s cleaning was a little slow, so she was busy until now. ”

This place was not far from the neighborhood.

“After walking through an alley, she would be home in 10 minutes. ”

“Ye Shu walked on the road, thinking that she had to get her driver’s license quickly so that it would be easier to commute to work. ”

There was almost no one on the road at 12 o’clock.

“When she passed by the alley that she usually passed by, Ye Shu suddenly felt a chill in her heart and subconsciously gripped her phone. ”

She didn’t know what was wrong with her either.

This feeling was very strange.

“The more ye Shu thought about it, the more she felt that something was wrong. She quickened her pace and walked forward. ”

“At this moment, two people suddenly rushed out from the corner and blocked in front of Ye Shu. “Beauty, where are you going?”At the same time, footsteps sounded behind her. There were about seven or eight men surrounding ye Shu. ”

“What do you want?”Ye Shu held her phone tightly.

“”Nothing much. I just want to play with you, beauty.”One of them reached out and lifted ye Shu’s chin. ”

Obscene laughter immediately came from all around.

It was fake to say that she didn’t panic.

“Ye Shu tried hard to calm herself down and pushed away the gangster’s hand. “If you don’t stop, I’ll call the Police!” ”

“Go ahead and call them!”

“Ye Shu picked up her phone, but before she could unlock it, it was snatched away. ”

“At this moment, her phone rang. ”

The Caller ID was burning.

That’s right.

The call was from ye Zhuo.

“Usually, Ye Shu would be home on time at 11:30. ”

“But today, it was already past 12, and Ye Shu was still not home. ”

“She called once, but no one picked up. ”

“She called twice, but no one picked up. ”

Ye Zao frowned slightly and walked out with his phone. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Coincidentally, Ye Sen came out of the bathroom after taking a shower. “Zao Zao, where are you going?” ”

“I’m going to see why my mom isn’t back yet.”

Ye Sen raised his head and looked at the clock hanging on the wall. “It’s already 12:05. is your mom still not back yet?”

Ye Zao shook his head.

“I’ll go with you.”Ye Sen immediately put down the towel to dry his hair and followed ye Zao out.

The two of them jogged along the way.

“When they reached the entrance of the alley, they felt that something was not right. ”

Ye Zao and Ye Sen looked at each other.

“The deeper they went, the more they felt that something was not right. ”

There were curses and cries.

“Mom!”

Ye Zao called out.

“Sear Sear!”

A strong voice came from the darkness.

“It’s My Mom!”Ye Zao turned around and looked at Ye Sen.

The two of them immediately ran towards the source of the voice.

“Seeing this scene, ye Zao’s eyes immediately turned red, and the anger in his body reached its peak. ”

He saw ye Shu sitting on the ground.

The clothes on her upper body were a little untidy.

“She crossed her arms in front of her chest and slowly moved back. “Don’t come over, don’t come over!” ”

“”Don’t worry, we’ll take good care of you.” ”

Ye Zao couldn’t care about anything else. He rushed over quickly and ruthlessly.

A painful wail immediately sounded in the air.

“But in the blink of an eye, the Hooligans were curled up on the ground. ”

Ye Sen directly picked up the steel pipe on the side and smashed it on the hooligans again and again. “Bastards! You Bunch of bastards! You bullied my sister! I Let You Bully My Sister!”

“”Mom, are you okay?” ”

“Zha Zha!”Ye Shu hugged ye Zha and cried out loud.

Fortunately!

“Fortunately, Ye Zha came early. ”

“If it were a little bit more, she would not be her. ”

“”Mom, it’s okay! It’s Okay!”Ye Zha patted ye Shu’s back. ”

“Thinking of what she had just experienced, ye Shu still had lingering fear and hugged ye Zha tightly. ”

“”Stop fighting! If you keep fighting, people will die! We are also taking money from others to do things for others! We didn’t do it on purpose! Please spare us! Please!”The hooligans knelt on the ground with tears streaming down their faces. ”

All of them were beaten black and blue. It was a horrible sight.

“Who asked you to come?”Ye Zao suddenly asked.

The air was quiet. No one was willing to speak.

They also had the rules of the street.

“Say it!”Ye Sen smashed another steel pipe down.

There was a painful wail in the air.

One of the hooligans quickly took out his phone with trembling hands. “It’s... It’s the woman in the photo.”

Ye Zhuo took the phone.

She didn’t know this person.

This person must be working for someone else.

“Ye Zhuo sent the photo to his phone. Then, he took out a bottle of medicine from his pocket and threw it in front of the Hooligans. “Take the medicine in the bottle.” ”

The hooligans looked at each other. No one dared to take the medicine.

What if the medicine was poisonous?

“Suddenly, one of the hooligans stood up and ran. ”

He was very fast!

Ye Zao picked up a steel pipe and threw it out.

Bang!

The steel pipe hit the man’s calf.

Bang!

He fell heavily to the ground.

“At the same time, the crisp sound of bones breaking could be heard in the air. ”

“”I’ll eat it! I’ll eat it!”One of the Hooligans quickly picked up the medicine bottle on the ground, poured out a pill, and swallowed it. ”

“I’ll eat it too!”

The remaining hooligans scrambled to eat the medicine. No one dared to cheat.

“Seeing that they had finished eating the medicine, ye Zao said, “Scram!” ”

The few of them felt as if they had been pardoned and ran out of the room.

“Ye Zao helped Ye Shu up from the ground. “Mom, let’s go home.” ”

“Ye Shu had gradually calmed down. She stood up with Ye Zao, but her body was still trembling. ”

“Sister is fine.”Ye Sen walked over and held ye Shu’s arm.

The two nephews protected ye Shu in the middle.

“Ye Sen continued, “Zao Zao, what did you feed those bastards just now? If it were up to me, I would have turned them into eunuchs! Otherwise, it would be too easy for those bastards!” ”

“Fortunately, other than being a little frightened, ye Shu did not let those bastards succeed. Otherwise, killing them would not be enough to vent their hatred! ”

“That medicine is to make them become eunuchs.”Ye Zao’s voice was cold.

“Really?”Ye Sen said in surprise.

Ye Zao nodded.

“After returning home and comforting ye Shu, ye Zao turned on the computer and began to search for information on that woman. ”

Liu Xiaodie.

Female.

“Currently, she was Mu Yourong’s assistant. ”

It did not need to be thought to know that the person behind this matter was definitely mu yourong.

Ye Zhuo narrowed his eyes.

“Mu Yourong, right? ”

Then she would double the pain that ye Shu had suffered tonight and return it to Mu Yourong!

Ye Zhuo opened an encrypted international software and posted a bounty mission on it.

“The bounty was 500,000 yuan. ”

“After posting the mission, Ye Zhuo closed his computer and made a call. He walked to the French window and said, “I want to see the MU group declare bankruptcy in three days!” ”
