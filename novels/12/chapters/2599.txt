Translator: 549690339

“Scorch.”

“Ye Zao continued, “I was just about to look for you.” ”

“Look for me?”Xia Xiaoman was stunned. “What for?”

“Ye Zao said, “Let’s sit down and talk about it.” ”

“Looking at ye Zao’s expression, Ye Shu was a little anxious. “Scorch, it’s not a big deal, right?” ”

“Ye Zao smiled. “Don’t worry, it’s not a big deal.” ”

“That’s good.”Ye Shu heaved a sigh of relief.

“After the few of them sat down, a servant brought some tea over. Only then did ye Zao speak slowly. “Fourth aunt, someone hired a private detective to investigate you.” ”

“Hearing this, Xia Xiaoman was shocked. “Who? Who’s investigating me?” ”

“”Someone called Zhou Cuihua,”ye Zao said. ”

Zhou Cuihua?

“Xia Xiaoman frowned slightly. “Is the information reliable? Zao Zao, how did you know?” ”

“”It’s a coincidence.”Ye Zhuozhu took a sip of tea and continued, “The detective Zhou Cuihua found happened to be opened by a friend of mine. My friend investigated and found out about your relationship with me, so she told me about it.” ”

“Ye Zhuozhu paused. “By the way, fourth aunt, do you know this person called Zhou Cuihua?” ”

“Xia Xiaoman nodded. “Yes, she’s my cousin. Zhuozhu, do you know what she’s investigating about me?” ”

“Ye Zhuozhuo hesitated for a moment before continuing, “It’s about her lifestyle. She suspects that you’re outside...” ”

The rest of his words were self-evident.

Xia Xiaoman was so angry that she slammed the table and stood up. “Outrageous! This Zhou Cuihua is really too outrageous!”

Anyone would be angry if they were suspected of having a lifestyle problem for no reason.

“Ye Zhuozhuo continued, “In addition, my friend told me that Zhou Cuihua and her husband, Li Dalong, had gotten a divorce certificate from the Civil Affairs Bureau this morning. I don’t know if these two things are related.” ”

“Xia Xiaoman said, “I think I know what she wants to do!” ”

She and Zhou cuihua were cousins. The two of them had grown up together. Zhou Cuihua had always been competitive since she was young. She was better at everything than Xia Xiaoman!

“This time, they were getting a divorce and hiring a detective. It was obvious what Zhou Cuihua wanted to do. ”

This kind of person was really too disgusting!

She actually had such dirty thoughts!

Xia Xiaoman continued to state her own thoughts.

“Although Xia Xiaoman had guessed it herself, her guess was not too far off. ”

“Hearing this, Ye Shu frowned slightly. “Why is your cousin like this!” ”

“”It’s cousin.”Xia Xiaoman continued, “She has always been like this since she was young, but I didn’t expect her to be so unwilling.” ”

Zhou cuihua actually divorced because she was unwilling to accept it!

“Ye Shu said, “It’s better to divorce this kind of person as far away from her as possible.” ”

“En.”Xia Xiaoman nodded. “I know. Treat it as if she doesn’t have such a relative in the future!”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Not only do we have to distance ourselves from her, we also have to invite her into the trap and make her suffer the consequences of her actions.” ”

“Upon hearing this, Xia Xiaoman raised her head to look at ye Zhuo and asked, “Zhuozhuo, what do you mean?” ”

Ye Zao smiled mysteriously.

“Ye Shu said anxiously, “You Child, say something! You’re so anxious that your fourth aunt and I are about to die.” ”

Ye Zao’s Red Lips parted slightly as he spoke slowly.

“The wildfire could not be extinguished, but the spring breeze would come again. ”

“When dealing with people like Zhou cuihua, one should use a once-and-for-all method so that she would never be able to jump again. ”

“Hearing this, Xia Xiaoman smiled and said, “This smart person handles things differently. Zao Zao, you’re absolutely right. This is the way it should be done!” ”

Ye Shu nodded as well. “This method is indeed not bad.”

“Around six o’clock in the evening, Cen Shaoqing arrived with the birthday present that he had prepared for ye Shu. ”

“”Auntie, this is a little gift from my mother and grandmother. Please accept it.” ”

“Ye Shu took the gift box with both hands and said with a smile, “I’ve let your mother and grandmother spend so much money on it. It’s just a simple birthday. It’s not a big birthday. Actually, it doesn’t have to be like this.” ”

Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads. “It’s just some small things. As long as Aunty doesn’t mind it.”

“”You Child, what are you saying!”Ye Shu continued, “Hurry up and go inside. The meal is about to start.” ”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and looked around. He did not see her figure.

Where is she?

Did she not come back?

Cen Shaoqing frowned.

“Ye Shu saw his expression. Ye Shu smiled and said, “She is burning in the kitchen! Go quickly!” ”

“”Thank you, Aunty.”Cen Shaoqing turned and walked towards the kitchen. ”

“He was already very familiar with every part of the Lin family. Naturally, he knew the way to the kitchen. ”

“Ye Shu looked at Cen Shaoqing’s back and laughed softly, “This child.” ”

Cen Shaoqing came to the kitchen and indeed saw ye Zao in the kitchen.

She was wearing an orange dress and a pale white apron. The pale blue mask covered most of her face. She was flipping the pot with one hand and holding a spoon with the other. She was cooking the dishes in a proper manner.

Her eyes were serious.

“”I didn’t expect you to know how to flip the Spoon!”The head chef said with some surprise, “Without seven or eight years of experience, I really can’t do it!”Especially when ye Zao was doing it in a proper manner. ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Uncle Liu, you don’t know about this, right? I know a lot of things!” ”

“The head chef continued, “I didn’t know before, but now I know.”In the past, when ye Zhuo stood at the kitchen door and said that he knew how to cook, everyone thought that ye Zhuo was bragging. ”

“After all, Ye Zhuo was a rich young lady! ”

How could the hands of this rich young lady be used to stir the ladle?

“She probably couldn’t even distinguish between soy sauce and vinegar, right? ”

“Who would have thought that not only did ye Zhuo know how to cook, but he was also very skilled! ”

“The head chef looked at ye Zhuo and continued, “Young Lady, have you learned it before?” ”

“”I haven’t really learned it before, but I’ve often seen you guys stir the ladle,”ye Zhuo continued, “Actually, this isn’t very difficult. It’s easy once you get the hang of it.” ”

“The head chef said, “Then you’re too amazing!”Back then, he had studied cooking for more than three years before he could barely reach ye Zhuo’s current level. ”

Some people were really blessed by the heavens.

“It’s just so-so.”

Cen Shaoqing leaned against the door and looked at her.

“After ye Zhuo finished cooking, he looked back and saw Cen Shaoqing standing at the door. ”

“When did you come?”

“Cen Shaoqing walked over and said in a low voice, “Just now.” ”

“After saying that, CEN Shaoqing continued, “Do you need me to help you?” ”

“”No need.”Ye Zhuo poured some oil into the pot and continued, “You only know how to cook a few dishes?” ”

It was a little disdainful.

“”You’re underestimating me!”Cen Shaoqing rolled up his sleeves and walked to ye Zhuo’s side. He took the pot from her and said, “Let me show you what I Can Do.” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Sweet and sour pork ribs, do you know how to Cook?” ”

“”Of course I know how to cook,”Cen Shaoqing said ”

“He was not bragging. As he said that he knew how to cook, his hands began to move. ”

“In fact, Cen Shaoqing did not know how to cook at the beginning. After he met ye Zao, he learned a little. Later, he learned more and more, and it became that he knew everything now. ”

“Ye Zao stood at the side, crossed his arms over his chest, and said with a smile, “Not bad, not bad. It seems to be true.” ”

“Is that so?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“”Of course,”ye Zao said. ”

“Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted slightly. “Thank you, leader, for thinking so highly of me.” ”

“Before long, the two of them had cooked five beautiful dishes. ”

“When all the dishes were served, an Lizi and Buttface had also arrived. ”

“Seeing Cen Shaoqing wearing an apron, an lizi asked in surprise, “Is fifth master going to Cook Tonight?” ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Yes.”

“An lizi smiled and said, “Then I’ll eat more tonight.” ”

This was the first time she had seen Cen Shaoqing Cook. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Ye Zhuo smiled and nodded. “Okay.”

“Dog Two stood at the side, looking a little reserved, ”
