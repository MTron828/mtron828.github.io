Ten Minutes?

The problem in their eyes could be solved in ten minutes in Baron’s eyes.

It was enough to show Baron’s terrifying strength.

“Before Consulting Baron, Cao Wei had also consulted other hackers in the country.”

They said that it would take three to one week to check the information.

That was why Cao Wei directly went to Baron.

Baron did not disappoint him!

“Cao Wei gulped and said, “Um, did you bring your computer?””

Was Baron planning to use his phone to look up the information?

That was too amazing.

“Under Cao Wei’s admiring gaze, Baron smiled, raised his left hand, and turned the dial on his wrist.”

Kacha —

A round dial was taken off by Baron.

“Before Cao Wei could react, the round dial turned into a rectangular object under Baron’s manipulation.”

“Then, a palm-sized screen was assembled.”

“Baron placed the screen on the rectangular object, reached out and pressed the button. Immediately, red light shone out from inside, and a laser keyboard was cast on the table.”

Cao Wei was stunned by what he saw.

He thought it was just a watch.

He did not expect the watch to turn into a small computer in seconds.

This scene could only be seen in sci-fi movies.

“If he did not see it with his own eyes, Cao Wei would not believe it was real.”

It was unbelievable.

Baron became famous as a teenager with a sense of pride. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

He liked to see others acting like they had never seen the market before.

For example...

The current Cao Wei.

“However, it was not Cao Wei’s fault.”

“After all, China did not have many talents and technology was backward. The Hacker Alliance had a total of more than a hundred people, but the Chinese only had three people.”

“Moreover, those three people were just miscellaneous jobs in the hacker alliance.”

“As a C nation person, he had a strong sense of pride as he stood in front of Cao Wei.”

Baron Glanced at Cao Wei and continued to assemble the computer.

“After assembling the computer, Baron put on special glasses and began to operate the computer. His ten fingers danced on the laser keyboard in different ways, and the table was knocked loudly by him.”

“Cao Wei just stared at him with his mouth agape, unable to say a word.”

The waiter who came to deliver the coffee was also stunned.

He hesitated for a few seconds before leaving.

Baron ignored everyone’s gazes and stared at the screen.

“In less than a minute, he found the database of the World Under Heaven Company.”

He clicked ‘hack’.

“It took twenty seconds for the progress bar to go from 1% to 50% , then 60% , 80% , 99% .”

“Seeing that he was about to reach 100% , the corner of Baron’s mouth curled up slightly. He turned to Cao Wei and said, “Mr. Cao, I found it.””

“So Fast?”Cao Wei said in surprise.

It had only been three minutes.

There were still seven minutes to the ten minutes that Baron had mentioned.

This was too amazing.

“”Mr. Cao, come over and take a look yourself,”Baron said with a smile.”

“Cao Wei walked over and looked at the computer screen. His expression was a little strange. He turned to Baron and said, “Mr. Baron, this doesn’t seem right, right?””

Baron took a sip of his coffee. “What’s Wrong?”

Cao Wei pointed at the screen. “Take a look for yourself.”

Baron turned around and looked at the screen. His eyes were filled with disbelief.

The screen was filled with English letters and an inverted red triangle with an exclamation mark.

Danger!

Danger!

“Before Baron could react, the computer screen was completely black.”

“Baron did not expect that not only did he not succeed in hacking, but he was also attacked by the other party’s firewall.”

“Although Cao Wei did not know much about computers or hacking techniques, he could tell that Baron had been tricked. He continued, “Mr. Baron, what do we do now?””

“”I was careless just now.”Baron frowned slightly. He did not expect that the time would be stuck at the last 1% . If he kept staring at the computer screen, he would not give the other party a chance to attack, “Give me another 10 minutes.””

How could china have such a powerful engineer?

Baron was very puzzled.

“”Okay.”Cao Wei smiled and said, “No rush, I’m not in a rush. Mr. Baron, you can do as you please.””

“The machine was considered to be useless since it was attacked instead of being successfully invaded. Baron took off the pendant on his necklace and reassembled it into a computer, entering the state.”

Cao Wei looked at Baron who was fighting and swallowed his throat.

Baron was Baron!

“As expected of an internationally renowned hacker. Not only could the watch he carried be assembled into a computer, even the necklace could be turned into a computer.”

It was not even enough to make one feel unconvinced.

“One minute, two minutes...”

“Until five minutes had passed, Baron did not succeed in breaking in. Every time he reached 99% , it would automatically jam. If he did not back out, he would still be attacked by the other party.”
