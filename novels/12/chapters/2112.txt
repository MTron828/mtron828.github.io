“Okay.”Ye Han nodded.

...

“The next morning, while there was still time, ye Zao brought Cen Shaoqing to Grandma Fei’s house. ”

“Almost when ye Zao came over, Grandma Fei was sitting in a rocking chair on the balcony, basking in the sun. ”

In her arms was a cat that was also old.

“”This is the Granny Fei that I told you about. “Granny Fei is old and her ears are not very good. The old lady doesn’t want to wear a hearing aid,”ye Zao whispered, “When you talk to her later, be careful to speak louder.” ”

“Okay.”

“Hearing the footsteps, the cat in Granny Fei’s arms called Lazily. ”

“”Granny Fei.”Even when ye Zao and Cen Shaoqing walked to the old lady’s side, the old lady still did not wake up. ”

“Helpless, Ye Zhuo had no choice but to increase the decibel. ”

“Only then did Grandma Fei slowly wake up. When she opened her eyes, she saw two unfamiliar faces. ”

“Grandma Fei was stunned for a moment before she reacted. She smiled and said, “Zhuo Zhuo is here!” ”

“”Grandma Fei, you recognized me.” ”

“”Look at what you’re saying. Even though Grandma is old, Ye has not reached the age where his eyes are dim.”Grandma Fei continued, “The last time when you dressed up as Joey to call me, I recognized you.” ”

“However, she didn’t dare to say it out loud because she was afraid that she would miss out on ye Zao’s important matter. However, it was different this time. This time, ye Zao had settled everything. ”

“”Grandma Fei, you really know me too well.”Ye Zao smiled. ”

“”You’re the child that I’ve watched grow up. Other than your grandma, I know you the best.”Whenever she talked about her sister who was suffering, Grandma Fei would always be very sad. ”

If only her sister had not died.

She would definitely be very gratified.

She would be gratified that the child that she had raised by herself had finally grown up.

“Unfortunately, her sister would never be able to see him again. ”

“After saying this, grandmother Fei looked at Ye Zhuo. “Zhuozhuo, who is this?” ”

“Ye Zhuo held onto Cen Shaoqing’s arm. “Grandmother Fei, let me introduce you. This is my boyfriend, Cen Shaoqing.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing took off the human skin mask on his face, revealing his handsome features. “Hello, Grandma Fei. I’m Cen Shaoqing, Zao Zao’s boyfriend. You can call me little CEN.” ”

“Grandma Fei stood up in surprise. First, she looked at Ye Zao, then she turned to look at Ye Zao. “Zao Zao, what did you say? Who Did you say this is?” ”

“”Grandma, this is my boyfriend, Cen Shaoqing,”ye Zao repeated. ”

Boyfriend!

Ye Zao actually had a boyfriend.

“Grandma Fei was almost in tears. She held ye Zao’s hand and looked at the horizon. “Elder sister, elder sister, did you hear that! Our Zao Zao has a boyfriend!” ”

Happy.

Grandma Fei was really happy.

“She had watched ye Zao Grow Up, so she knew ye Zao’s character very well. ”

“She had also introduced a boyfriend to ye Zao before, but ye Zao had rejected all of them. ”

“Grandmother Fei had thought that she would not be able to see ye Zao find a boyfriend in her lifetime, but she did not expect... ... She did not expect that she would actually see it. ”

“Grandmother Fei took Cen Shaoqing’s hand again and placed it on Ye Zao’s hand, “Little Cen, our family’s Zao Zao is a very good and outstanding girl. I can tell that you are also a very outstanding boy. The two of you are lucky to have met each other and come together. Burning Flames was born bitter. She wasn’t even big enough to be a kitten when she started wandering. Although she met my older sister later, we were poor at that time and couldn’t give her a better life. In the rest of your life, please cherish burning flames... ... It wasn’t easy for her to get to where she is today. You Can’t bully her. When two people are together, they have to learn to tolerate each other, accommodate each other, and learn from each other’s strengths to make up for their weaknesses ... .. ”

“At the end of her sentence, Granny Fei was already sobbing uncontrollably. ”

“Actually, it was her elder sister who should be saying these words to Ye Zhuo. ”

She was now enjoying her elder sister’s blessings.

“I will definitely remember your words. Treat Luoluo well and never let her down.”Cen Shaoqing looked at Granny Fei with a determined gaze.

“”Good, good, good.”Granny Fei nodded in satisfaction. “Child, with your words, I am relieved.” ”

“After saying that, Granny Fei continued, “Don’t stand outside. Come, come, come. Let’s sit in the house.” ”

“Granny Fei liked to be quiet. Unless it was a special day, she would be the only one in the house. ” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

There wasn’t even a servant.

“Granny Fei beckoned the two of them into the house. Looking at Cen Shaoqing, she asked in puzzlement, “Little Cen, have we met before?” ”

“Should not.”Cen Shaoqing said.
