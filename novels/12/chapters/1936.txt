Jin Ruyu repeated what she had just said.

“Ming Yao gulped and continued, “Are you... Are You Serious?” ”

“Yes.”Jin Ruyu nodded very seriously.

“Ming Yao Thought for a while and said, “Alright. In case they rush us!” ”

“Jin ruyu said, “It’s a deal.” ”

Ming Yao smiled and nodded. “It’s a deal.”

“On the other side, after ye Zao entered the temple, he took the money for the incense oil and burned the incense. ”

“The two of them followed like shadows, like a celestial couple. ”

This scene fell into the line of sight of a figure not far away.

“The man wore a black suit and stood in the crowd. He had a black hat on his head. The wide brim of the hat covered his eyes, leaving only his beautiful lips and his thin chin. ”

“Although the man didn’t say or do anything, he exuded a sense of sadness. ”

People didn’t dare to approach him.

“After a long time, when ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing were no longer in the crowd, the man turned around slightly and walked back. ”

There weren’t many people walking down the mountain. The man looked even more lonely.

At the foot of the mountain.

“Bai Jiayu was leaning against the car door with a cigarette in his mouth, looking casual. ”

“He was handsome and ruffled, attracting a lot of young girls to come and ask for wechat. ” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Bai Jiayu didn’t reject any of them and added all of them, making his good buddies by his side envious. “I say, you brat, what kind of luck are you having!” ”

“A total of seven or eight young girls came, all of them came for Bai Jiayu. ”

“Bai Jiayu blew on the smoke and said narcissistically, “This is charm! Mouse, you’re still a little lacking!” ”

“Tian Zihao was a little speechless and said, “Tch!” ”

“As he said that, tian zihao said again, “By the way, when did third brother start to believe in Buddha?” ”

“In his impression, song Shiyu did not believe in Buddha, did not believe in people, and only believed in himself. ”

“However, he did not know when it began, but song Shiyu began to burn incense and pray to Buddha. ”

“Furthermore, he came to the temple to burn incense on the first morning of every year. ”

Bai Jiayu shook his head. “I’m not too sure either.”

“Song Shiyu had always hidden himself well. Even though he was his good brother, he did not know much about his private life. ”

Bai Jiayu was also very curious about this matter.

“Tian zihao continued, “By the way, let me ask you something.” ”

“”Speak,”Bai Jiayu said. ”

“Tian zihao continued, “Didn’t third brother keep looking for someone? Have you found him yet?” ”

“Who are you asking for?”Bai Jiayu looked at Tian Zihao.

“”Who else could it be? Of course it’s that infatuated cousin of mine!”Tian zihao continued, “Siyao has waited for third brother for so many years. I wonder what third brother can do to give her a reply.” ”

Bai Jiayu took out another cigarette from the pack. “Go back and persuade siyao to stop waiting. She Won’t get the result! Third Brother doesn’t have a heart!”

“Even if he did have a heart, it didn’t belong to Chen Siyao. ”

“Tian zihao sighed. “We’ve tried to persuade her and scolded her. She’s always been like that, so there’s nothing we can do! You’re so close to third brother. Can you help find out if there’s someone in third brother’s Heart?” ”

“He doesn’t even have a heart. How could there be someone?”Bai Jiayu asked.

There was a period of time when Bai Jiayu suspected that song Shiyu had someone in his heart.

But he dispelled this doubt later.

“Because song Shiyu was never someone who wronged himself. If there was someone in his heart, he would definitely take it by force. He wouldn’t stop until he achieved his goal. ”

“However, until now, song Shiyu still did not make any movements. This was clearly abnormal. ”

“Tian zihao continued, “Then this matter will be easy to handle! Third Brother will not be a bachelor for the rest of his life! Sooner or later, he will have to get married and have children to carry on the family line. Anyway, he will marry whoever he wants. He might as well marry my cousin back. My cousin is so infatuated with him, and the two families know each other very well. What’s wrong with that?” ”

“You’re thinking too much.”Bai Jiayu flicked the ash off his cigarette. “Third brother isn’t the kind of person who would marry and have children just to carry on the family line.”

“In other words, if song Shiyu needed to marry and have children, he wouldn’t have waited until now. ”
