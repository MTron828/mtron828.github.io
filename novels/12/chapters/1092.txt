Scar Removal Cream?

What brand of scar removal cream was so effective that it could wipe away such a serious burn without leaving any trace?

“Zhao Xueyin was a little curious. She looked up at si lui and continued, “What brand of Scar Removal Cream did you buy?” ”

“Si lui slowly rolled up his sleeves and said, “I bought it from an old Chinese doctor. There’s no brand.” ”

“”OH.”Zhao Xue smiled and nodded. “If I get scalded in the future, you can introduce me to this old Chinese doctor.” ”

“What nonsense.”Si Lu tilted his head and looked at Zhao Xue Yin. His tone was a little heavy. “You won’t get hurt!”

He would always protect Zhao Xue Yin and not let her get hurt.

“Zhao Xue smiled and said, “I’m just saying. Why Are You So Serious? By the way, what do you want to Eat?” ”

“You decide.”Si Lui’s tone was a little heavy.

Zhao Xue Yin tilted her head and thought for a moment. “Then let’s eat Japanese food?”

“Sure.”Si lui nodded.

Japanese food was mostly raw food.

“In fact, he was not used to eating Japanese food. ”

“But Zhao Xue Yin liked it, so he liked it too. ”

Si lui started the engine and drove to the Japanese food shop that Zhao Xue Yin frequented.

“Looking at the familiar road conditions, Zhao Xueyin’s lips curled up slightly. ”

Regardless of other external conditions.

The lawyer was really a very good man.

He would remember every one of his preferences.

He would accommodate himself.

It was a pity.

It was just that being born was not very good.

“He had talent but had nowhere to display it. Once he left Shunxi Financial Group, he would be nothing. ”

“Thinking of this, Zhao Xueyin sighed softly. ”

The lawyer tilted his head slightly. “What’s Wrong?”

“Nothing.”Zhao Xueyin smiled and turned around. “I just feel a little tired.”

“”If you’re tired, then rest more.”The lawyer continued, “You don’t have to worry about ye Zhuo’s matter. Just leave it to me.” ”

“Big Brother Si...”

“Realizing what Zhao Xueyin wanted to say, the lawyer directly interrupted Zhao Xueyin’s words. “Don’t thank me.” ”

Zhao Xueyin smiled.

She felt that she couldn’t continue like this.

The lawyer was a good man.

She couldn’t delay the lawyer anymore.

“Zhao Xueyin opened her mouth, “Brother Si, actually, i... I...”She didn’t know how to continue. ”

How could she not hurt the lawyer’s Pride?

The lawyer was so good.

She really didn’t want to hurt Si Lui.

And she didn’t want to see Si lui sad and sad.

“What’s Wrong?”Si lui turned to look at Zhao Xueyin.

“I...”

“Si lui controlled the steering wheel with one hand and patted Zhao Xueyin’s head with the other. “If you have something to say, can’t you say it to me?” ”

“Zhao Xueyin was very conflicted. No matter what, she couldn’t let Si lui get hurt. ”

“As the words came to her mouth, Zhao Xueyin continued, “Brother Si, actually, I want to drink wowo milk tea, but you seem to have driven over.” ”

“Si lui smiled and said, “I thought it was something! It’s okay, just turn around at the next intersection.” ”

“Zhao Xueyin quickly said, “No need, no need, it’s too troublesome! Let’s go directly to the Japanese restaurant.” ”

“”It’s not troublesome.”At the next traffic light intersection, Si lui directly turned around and went to the milk tea shop. ”

“Zhao Xueyin looked at the lawyer, her heart filled with warmth. ”

“Soon, the car stopped in front of Wowo milk tea shop. ”

“The lawyer turned to look at Zhao Xueyin. “It’s snowing outside, don’t get out.” ”

“Okay.”Zhao Xueyin nodded.

The lawyer got out of the car to buy milk tea.

“Looking at the man’s back disappearing into the snow, he narrowed his eyes slightly. ”

It was snowing.

There was a long line in the milk tea shop.

“She didn’t know what method the lawyer used, but not only did he not line up, but he quickly bought the milk tea and walked back. ”

Click —

The car door was pulled open from outside.

“The lawyer, who was covered in snow, walked in from outside and handed the milk tea to Zhao Xueyin. ”

“Thank you.”Zhao Xueyin reached out and took the milk tea.

It was her favorite barley round flavor.

This was the tacit understanding between her and the lawyer.

No matter when.

The lawyer knew what she wanted.

The boiling hot milk tea warmed her whole body after one sip.

“Do you want to have a sip?”Zhao Xueyin brought the milk tea to the lawyer’s mouth.

Zhao Xueyin and the lawyer had known each other for many years.

They had been inseparable for a long time.

Zhao Xueyin didn’t think much of it since they were just drinking a cup of milk tea together.

“However, Si Lui’s face was slightly red. He was stunned when he saw the milk tea being handed over. ”

“Zhao Xueyin looked at Si lui. “Brother Si, are you looking down on me?” ”

“”No, no!”Si lui hurriedly explained. “Xueyin, don’t misunderstand.” ”Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates
