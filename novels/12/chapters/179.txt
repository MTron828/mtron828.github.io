Chapter 180: 086: Murder in prison! A big shot in the business world! 8

Cen Shaoqing was unmoved. He even wanted to laugh. “You’re too childish.”

Old Children, old children. This sentence was absolutely correct when applied to old Mrs. Cen.

Old Mrs. Cen:”...”she really wanted to scold him. You’re the One Who’s childish, your whole family is childish! But when she thought about it, Cen Shaoqing’s family included her! So, Old Mrs. Cen forcibly held back.

Putting away her chopsticks, old Mrs. Cen continued, “The miracle doctor who cured grandma today will come to our house as a guest.”

Old Mrs. Cen knew Cen Shaoqing’s character.

If she had directly said that your future wife would come to our house, Cen Shaoqing would definitely not obediently cooperate.

But it was different to say it in another way.

Moreover, she was not lying. Ye Zhuo was a godly doctor to begin with!

“Are you coming today?”Cen Shaoqing raised his eyes slightly.

Cen Shaoqing had always been very grateful to that godly doctor whom he had never met before.

If it were not for him, old Mrs. Cen would not have been able to recover at all.

For the past twenty years, Old Mrs. Cen had been suffering from illness. It was also during this period of time that old Mrs. Cen truly smiled.

Other than gratitude, Cen Shaoqing was also very curious about the miracle doctor who cured old Mrs. Cen.

......

After all, Old Mrs. Cen’s head disease had not been cured after so many years of treatment.

In the hands of this miracle doctor, a prescription was enough to solve it.

Old Mrs. Cen nodded. “Why don’t you not go out today? Stay at home and properly entertain the guests. No matter what, she is grandmother’s Savior.”

“Of course.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “He cured your head disease. I will definitely thank him personally.”

Old Mrs. Cen nodded with satisfaction. Although her eldest grandson was sometimes quite annoying and stubborn, his character was absolutely fine!

“When will he come?”Cen Shaoqing continued to ask.

Old Mrs. Cen looked back at the clock hanging on the wall. “He said he will come in the morning. He should be leaving now.”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Then I’ll go upstairs first to explain to the secretary about today’s work. I’ll also hold a video conference. When the godly doctor arrives, you can ask someone to go upstairs and call me.”

“Okay.”Old Mrs. Cen nodded.

Looking at Cen Shaoqing’s back view as he went upstairs, Zhou Xiang gave old Mrs. Cen a thumbs up. “Mom, you’re the Best!”

Old Mrs. Cen said proudly, “That’s true. Otherwise, how can you say that old ginger is still spicier!”

Ye family.

Ye Zao came back from running and went to the bathroom to take a shower.

Ten minutes later.

Ye Zao walked out of the bathroom wrapped in a towel and went to the wardrobe to pick out clothes.

Like all girls, ye Zao always lacked a piece of clothing in his wardrobe.

After choosing for a long time, Ye Zao chose a plain white dress with a waist. He put on a long coat over it and paired it with a pair of Martin boots. It was an extremely cool outfit!

After changing his clothes, ye Zao whistled at the mirror, “How can I look so good!”

It was already past nine o’clock in the morning when they left the ye residence. When they got on the Internet to book a ride, the driver in the front seat could not help but sneak a few glances at the rearview mirror.

After being an online car-hailing driver for so long, this was the first time he had received an order to go to Mian Xiu Manor!

Who in Yunjing didn’t know about Mian Xiu Manor?

This little girl was definitely a rich second generation!

Half an hour later, the car stopped at the main entrance of Mian Xiu Manor.

Ye Zhuo got out of the car and walked straight inside.

Mian Xiu Manor had entrance guards. Under normal circumstances, ordinary people wouldn’t be able to enter, but ye Zhuo could tell at a glance that she wasn’t an ordinary person. Dressed in a wine-red coat, she walked with an aura that made her open up the entire place! She was exceptionally domineering!

She was unbearably cold.

No one dared to stop her.

The people living in Jin Xiu manor were all nobles. If she accidentally offended a noble, then she wouldn’t be able to bear the consequences.

These security personnel were all very perceptive!

Jin Xiu manor was indeed worthy of being a wealthy district. Along the way, it was either a small bridge, flowing water, or all sorts of rare animals.

Black Swans, Alpacas, Peacocks...

As well as all kinds of expensive luxury cars parked by the roadside. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Ye Zhuo came all the way to the Cen family’s manor and rang the doorbell.

Soon, a servant came to open the door. “Hello, May I ask who you are?”

“My surname is Ye.”Ye Zhuo’s tone was indifferent.

The servant quickly opened the door and said respectfully, “Please come in quickly!”Then, he said to the people beside him, “Quickly inform the old lady and Madam that Miracle Doctor Ye Is Here!”
