The two of them walked to the sugar water shop in front and stopped.

“Before they sat down, Cen Shaoqing took a handkerchief and wiped the table and chair carefully. “Leader, you can sit down now.” ”

Ye Zhuo leaned over and sat down.

“The waiter walked over and handed the dessert list to Ye Zhuo. “Beauty, your boyfriend treats you really well!” ”

“”Thank you.”Ye Zhuo took the dessert list and continued, “This, this, this, and this, all of them.” ”

“The waiter glanced at Ye Zhuo and could not help but remind her, “Beauty, the two of you might not be able to eat so much.” ”

Ye Zhuo raised his eyes slightly. “These are for me to eat alone.”

Eat alone?

How could one person eat so much?

“Hearing this, the waiter’s eyes were filled with shock. ”

Could this little girl be the legendary glutton?

“Under the waiter’s shocked gaze, CEN Shaoqing continued, “Give me a portion of longan sugar water.” ”

“Okay.”

“The sugar water restaurant served the food very quickly. In a short while, the table was filled with desserts. ”

“Looking at the alluring desserts, ye Zao’s eyes were filled with stars. He picked up a spoon and began to eat. ”

“In fact, Cen Shaoqing was not used to desserts in the past, but now he had been assimilated by Ye Zao. Not only did he start to eat desserts, he also felt that the taste of desserts was actually quite good. ”

...

The next day.

Ye Zao got up on time at seven o’clock.

“After changing his clothes, ye Zao stood in front of the French window and pulled open the curtains. ”

Huala —

Golden rays of sunlight shone in from the outside.

“It had snowed the whole night. At this moment, the outside was a vast expanse of whiteness. The sunlight shone on the snowy ground, refracting golden rays of light. ”

“Looking at the vast expanse of whiteness of the snowy scenery, his mood also improved. ”

Ye Zao hummed a tune as he went downstairs.

“Just as he went downstairs, he saw Lin Jincheng and Lin Ze shoveling snow in the courtyard. ”

Ye Zao also took a shovel to shovel snow.

“Just as he took the shovel, Lin Jincheng shouted, “Put it down, put it down! Put it down quickly! Zao Zao, put it down quickly!” ”

“Ye Zao was stunned and put down the shovel. “Dad, What’s Wrong?” ”

“Lin Jincheng jogged over. “Girls can’t do rough work. If they do rough work, their hands will get calluses! Leave this to your brother and me!” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Your posture just now was seen by people who don’t know. They thought that something big had happened!”Even ye Zao almost thought that there was poison on the shovel! ”

“Ye Langhua walked out of the house and handed ye Zao a warm baby. “Zao Zao, it’s cold outside. Come in quickly! It’s the same in Jincheng. It’s so cold, and you actually brought ah ze outside to shovel snow. Just let the servants do this kind of thing!” ”

“”Grandma, I’m wearing an air-conditioned shirt. I’m not cold at all.”Although he said he was not cold, Ye Zao’s hand still took the warm baby from ye Langhua honestly. ”

“Ye Shu walked out from the house and smiled. “Today is LABA festival! Zao Zao, call your uncle later and ask him to come home for dinner tonight.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Ye Sen had been very busy these few days. When he received ye Zhuo’s call, he was discussing a particularly important case with a client. “I’m at Huaihai Road Now!” ”

“After hanging up the phone, Ye Sen turned to look at the client and said apologetically, “I’m sorry, President Xu, my eldest niece called!” ”

“President xu smiled and said, “It’s okay.” ”

“At this moment, the television was broadcasting news about Dr. YC. Ye Sen pointed at the television and said, “The doctor on the television is my niece!” ”

President Xu looked up at the television.

Dr. YC?

Dr. YC was his niece?

Why didn’t he say that the entire scientific and technological world was his family’s relatives?

This ye Sen really knew how to Brag!

“He had no hair on his mouth, so he couldn’t do things properly. ”

“Director Xu instantly lost the intention to work with ye sen. he said tactfully, “Director Ye, why don’t we call it a day? I have other things to do...” ”

“Ye Sen looked at his watch, he smiled and said, “Sure! Coincidentally, my eldest niece is here too! Today is LABA festival, and she’s coming to pick me up for dinner! Children are so troublesome. I already said that I don’t want to go back, but she insisted on coming to pick me up. You said that this child is already here, so I can’t not go back!” ”

“Although he said that it was troublesome, Ye Sen’s eyes were filled with happiness. ”

Director Xu nodded in response and called for the waiter to settle the bill.

Ye Sen immediately took out cash. “How can I let director Xu pay for the Bill! I’ll pay for it!”

“Director Xu happened to not have any cash on him and wanted to use his phone to pay. When he saw Ye Sen take out the cash, he did not fight to pay. ”

“After paying, the two of them walked out of the door. ”

“This was a private membership restaurant. When they walked to the door, they had to pass by a long garden. It would take three to four minutes to walk there. The two of them chatted as they walked. ”

“”President Xu, is there anyone coming to pick you up later? If no one is picking you up, it just so happens that my eldest niece is coming to pick me up. Why don’t I let her send you back first?” ”

“President xu declined politely, “There’s no need. I have a chauffeur coming to pick you up.” ”

“”Alright then.”Ye Sen smiled and said, “President Xu, you mustn’t stand on ceremony with me!”! “It’s been snowing in the capital recently and the roads aren’t good. My niece’s driving skills are very good. If your chauffeur doesn’t come, ask her to send you back!” ”

“”Thank you, there’s no need.” ”

“Ye Sen continued, “By the way, President Xu, do you have a niece?” ”

Director Xu shook his head. “I’m an only child.”

“”Being an only child is pretty good, but it’s too lonely.” ”

Director Xu nodded.

“Not long after, the two of them walked out of the door. ”

“Ye Sen looked at the empty door and frowned slightly. “This child, didn’t we talk about it?” ”

Director Xu looked at Ye Sen with a mocking look in his eyes. “Your eldest niece didn’t come?”

It was right that she didn’t come.

“After all, Ye Sen’s niece wasn’t Dr. YC at all. ”

Wouldn’t she be exposed if she came? !

Ye Sen looked ahead. “Maybe something has delayed her!”

“Director Xu nodded and said deliberately, “Big shots like them who do research are usually busy. We should be more considerate!” ”

He thought that ye Sen would be embarrassed if he said this.

“Unexpectedly, not only was ye Sen not embarrassed, instead, he said with a smile, “You’re right! My niece is usually very busy. Because of the aircraft carrier plan, she is even busier. When she is busy, she can’t even see her shadow! If it weren’t for the LABA festival, I wouldn’t even see her...” ”

President Xu was a little speechless.

He never knew that people could be so thick-skinned.

Did Ye Sen think he was a fool without intelligence?

“”Director Xu, your driver isn’t here yet?”Ye Sen asked. ”

“”He’ll be here in three minutes,”director Xu said. ”

Ye Sen nodded.

“Soon, a Land Rover appeared at the intersection. Although it had been snowing for the past few days and there was ice on the road, the speed of this Land Rover was not slow at all. It drifted all the way here. ”

“With a beautiful swing of its tail, the Black Land Rover was placed horizontally in front of the two of them. ”

“Ye Zhuo pushed open the car door and placed one hand on the car door. He jumped down from the car just like that. His posture was a little handsome. “Uncle, I’m sorry. I bought a bottle of soy sauce for my mother on the way. I was delayed!” ”

“”It’s fine, it’s fine.”Ye Sen waved his hand and turned to look at President Xu. “President Xu, I’ll be leaving first then!” ”

President Xu looked at Ye Zao and was a little confused.

He had thought that Ye Sen was bragging to him.

He did not expect that his eldest niece was really the Dr. YC on TV.

“At this moment, president Xu thought that he was blind. ”
