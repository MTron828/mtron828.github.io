What did doctor Liu Mean by this?

“He only asked Doctor Liu to speak more seriously, and did not ask him to directly say that old Mrs. Li was dead! ”

“Doctor Liu said that old Mrs. Li was dead, so how could the future continue? ”

Could it be...

That something really happened to old Mrs. Li?

“Thinking of this, Li Erzhu’s face turned pale. ”

Old Lady Li was strong and strong. How could she be dead!

“Moreover, he had asked Doctor Xu before. Doctor Xu said that it was okay to drink a little. ”

It wouldn’t happen.

Old Lady Li wouldn’t die!

Li Erzhu looked at doctor Liu and blinked his eyes hard.

“Doctor Liu adjusted his glasses and continued, “Mr. Li Erzhu, I know that you might not be able to accept this reality for a while, but your father has really left! Your family members should quickly go in and see her one last time.” ”

“Seeing that doctor Liu did not look like he was joking, Li Er Zhu froze on the spot. ”

The color on his face instantly disappeared.

He was extremely pale.

“He was not like this because he could not bear to part with his mother, Old Lady Li. ”

It was because of Li Shuyi.

“With Old Lady Li as his trump card, he at least had a way to control Li San Zhu’s family. ”

“Now that old Mrs. Li was dead, what about Li Shuyi? ”

Was Li Shuyi really going to jail?

No.

No.

Li Shuyi was their family’s only hope. She could not go to jail.

Li Erzhu tightly grabbed the hem of his suit.

Li Sanzhu and his wife were also stunned. They thought that old Mrs. Li was just fooling around. They did not expect that she was really gone!

“No matter what, she was the mother who had given birth to him and raised him. No matter what his mother had done, she had already left! ”

It would be a lie to say that she did not feel anything at all.

“”Doctor, what did you say?”Li Sanzhu looked at the doctor, his eyes slightly red. “My mother, what happened to her?” ”

“The doctor sighed. “Old Lady is almost eighty years old this year, and all the organs in her body have already reached the point of failure. Although she did not ingest much poison, it was a fatal blow to her!” ”

“Hearing this, Li Sanzhu staggered and lost his balance. He took a few steps back. Fortunately, Fang yinyue was standing behind him and supporting him in time. ”

“Otherwise, he would have already fallen. ”

“Sanzhu.”

“I’m fine.”Li Sanzhu held back his tears. “Let’s go in and see Mom.”

“Okay.”Fang yinyue helped Li Sanzhu in.

“Li Erzhu also reacted at this time. He held doctor Liu’s hand tightly. “Doctor Liu! Doctor Liu, I beg you, please save my mom! As long as you can save him, no matter how much money you give, we have it!” ”

“Although he didn’t have much money, Li Sanzhu did. ”

Li Sanzhu was the richest man on the Prairie!

“Doctor Liu said, “Mr. Li Erzhu, I know you can’t accept this reality for a while, but the old lady has gone!” ”

“”One million. As long as you can save my mother, I can give you one million!” ”

“Doctor Liu said helplessly, “This is not a matter of money.” ”

“Five million!”Li Er Zhu said.

“No matter what, Old Lady Li could not die. ”

She could not die.

Li Shuyi was still in the detention center!

“Doctor Liu shook his head regretfully. “I’m really sorry, Mr. Li. I’ve really tried my best!” ”

“”Doctor Liu, I’m begging you. Please save my mother! You should know my third brother. He’s the richest man on the prairie. As long as you can save my mother, not to mention five million, even if it’s ten million, he will give it to you!” ”

“Doctor Liu only said, “Mr. Li Er, I’m sorry for your loss.” ”

Li Er Zhu was stunned on the spot.

In the operating theater.

Old Lady Li was lying on the cold operating bed. There was no longer any aura on her body.

Even the old lady herself did not expect that she would court death herself.

She was originally the most afraid of death.

She had yet to enjoy the blessings of Li Shuyi.

“When her life was at its final moment, other than regret, she was actually more unwilling. ”

She was unwilling to die just like that!

She held the doctor’s hand tightly and begged the doctor to save her.

“But in exchange, she could only say two weak words. ”

“”I’m sorry, Old Lady.” ”

“We’ve tried our best!”

“Old Lady Li’s eyes widened. In the end, she could only watch as death slowly eroded her body. ”

“”Mom! Mom!”Li Sanzhu held Old Lady Li’s already cold hand, and his face was filled with tears. ”

“Seeing this scene, Fang yinyue could not help but have her eyes turn red. ”

“A moment later, Fang yinyue turned slightly and walked to a quiet place to call Li Yueyue, informing her to come to the hospital to see Old Lady Li one last time. ”
