Chapter 271: 099: Zhao Pingting’s parents knew the truth

Translator: 549690339

Zhao Pingting went to work in a restaurant.

It was her first time doing manual labor.

It was tiring.

But Zhao Pingting persevered.

Because she knew that her parents were more tired than she was over the years.

It was good to experience her parents’hardships before she died.

...

On the other side.

Ye Zhuo was going to take the driver’s test today.

“Because she had an appointment with Zhao Pingting, she sent a wechat video to Zhao Pingting. ”

The video was quickly connected.

“On the other end of the screen, Zhao Pingting was wearing a work uniform from a restaurant. “Zao Zao, why are you looking for me?” ”

“Ye Zao said, “Didn’t we agree to take the driver’s license test together? which driver’s school did Auntie sign you up for? I’ll be right over.” ”

“Zhao pingting smiled and said, “Zao, I’m going to take a summer job recently. I’m afraid I won’t have time to take the driver’s license test with you. Sorry, I missed our appointment again.” ”

“Taking a summer job?”Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly.

“Yes.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“At this moment, Zhao Pingting’s voice came from the other end of the screen. ”

“Zhao Pingting immediately responded and said, “The shop is starting to get busy! Zao, I Won’t talk to you anymore. Let’s chat again when we have time.” ”

“After saying that, she hung up the video call. ”

“Zhao Pingting did not go, so ye Zhuozhuo had to go alone. ”

“She found a pretty good driving school online, which was near her home. ”

“The coach was a middle-aged man in his fifties, surnamed Wu. ”

“When he did not smile, he was a little serious. ”

“Recently, Zhengzhi’s college entrance examination had ended, and many students had come to learn how to drive. Some of the young people looked smart, and their studies were not bad, but in fact, they were very stupid. They could repeat a movement a few hundred times, but they could not remember it! ”

This caused coach Wu’s scalp to go numb when he saw the grade 12 graduates.

“When he saw the driving school staff bring ye Zhuo over, coach Wu’s heart skipped a beat. “You’re also a student of this year’s College Entrance Examination?” ”

Ye Zhuo nodded.

“Coach Wu scratched his head, pulled open the car door at the side, and got into the passenger seat. He turned around and said to ye zhuo, “You can get in the car too.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo sat in the back seat.

A student was sitting in the driver’s seat.

“Coach Wu said, “Let’s practice S-bend first.” ”

“Okay.”The student nodded.

“At first, the car was quite quiet. After a minute, coach Wu began to lose his composure. “How can students nowadays have such poor comprehension skills! It’s really worrying you to death! Did you really get into university?” ”

“I told you to step on the brakes! Why did you step on the accelerator! ! Do you want to commit murder?”

The student in the front seat turned red and became more and more flustered. He was so anxious that he didn’t know where to put his hands.

“Kill him! Kill him! Kill him with the steering wheel!”

Ye Zhuo glanced at the front seat and a smile appeared on his face.

Coach Wu turned his head angrily. “New student at the back! What are you laughing at! Have you learned it yet? Just laugh! Put away your phone and watch how he learns it seriously!”

“Ye Zhuo said, “Coach, I learned how to drive at home before. I came here today to confirm with you and make an appointment for the exam for the first, second, third, and fourth subjects.” ”

Coach Wu was speechless.

Young people nowadays were getting more and more unreliable!

They only knew how to Brag!

“He had been a coach for a long time, but this was the first time he had met someone who was so good at bragging. ”

He could even go to heaven!

Couldn’t such a beautiful little girl be a little more steady?

“”There are rules here. After passing the first exam, you can only make an appointment for the second exam at least 10 days later. After the second exam, you have to wait for 10 days before you can make an appointment for the third exam, and then you can make an appointment for the fourth exam! “Do you think it’s that easy to get a driver’s license? “It’s like eating sunflower seeds!” ”

“Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly. “In other words, I have to wait at least 30 days before I can get a driver’s license?” ”

“You want to get a driver’s license after 30 days?”?

“”Only a god who hasn’t failed a single exam can do that, right?”? ”

“Hearing this, coach Wu felt even more speechless. “Stop Dreaming! Among the students under me, the most talented one also waited for two months to get a driver’s license! Someone like you has to wait at least three to four months!” ”

Coach Wu had been a coach for such a long time.

He was too experienced.

“Usually, the beautiful ones were not very good at driving. ”

“Otherwise, ‘female driver’would not have become a derogatory term. ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled slightly. “Don’t worry, I Won’t fail.” ”

“”Won’t Fail?”Coach Wu frowned. “Come! I’ll give you the steering wheel. Drive one for us! Xiao Liu, get out of the car first.” ”

“Xiao Liu, who was in the driver’s seat, immediately opened the door and got out of the car. ”

Ye Zhuo came to the driver’s seat.

Although the configuration of the car was a little bad.

It was still passable.

He could still enjoy it.
