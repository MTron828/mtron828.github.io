“However, when it came to personal matters, Si lui was extremely embarrassed and his face turned red. “Xiao Yu, you just returned to the country. You must have a lot to say to Xue Yin. You two have a good chat. I have other things to do.” ”

“After saying that, Si lui turned around and walked out of the door. ”

“Looking at Si Lui’s flustered back, Jiang Xiao Yu covered her mouth and laughed. “I didn’t expect brother Si to be so innocent. Sister Xue Yin, it’s been so many years. has brother Si not confessed to you yet?” ”

Zhao Xueyin shook her head.

“Jiang Xiaoyu frowned, “Brother Si’s actions are too slow! It’s been so long!” Jiang Xiaoyu continued, “Sister Xueyin, why don’t you take the initiative to confess to brother Si? The two of you can’t keep delaying like this!” ”

Ask her to confess to Si Lui?

Was Jiang Xiaoyu’s brain filled with SH * t?

“Could it be that in Jiang Xiaoyu’s eyes, she was only worthy of someone like Si Lu? ”

“Jiang Xiaoyu didn’t find it disgusting, but she did! ”

“Zhao Xueyin maintained her smile. “This isn’t a matter of confessing or not confessing! Perhaps fate hasn’t arrived yet! Oh right, Xiaoyu, have you seen Miss Ye?” ”

“You mean ye Zao?”Jiang Xiaoyu’s attention was instantly diverted.

“Yes.”Zhao Xueyin nodded.

“Jiang Xiaoyu said, “I just arrived! I haven’t seen ye Zao yet! But I did see the Phoenix in the middle of the hall! I heard that it was given to ye Zao by Master Five of DK. Is It True?” ”

“It’s true.”

“Hearing that, Jiang Xiaoyu’s face was full of surprise. “They all say that ye Zao is very good-looking. Is that true?” ”

“It’s also true.”Zhao Xueyin nodded.

“How good-looking?”Jiang Xiaoyu was very curious.

“She had been traveling all over the world these years and had seen many beauties. However, there were very few people who could make Zhao Xueyin nod and admit that she was a beauty! ”

Could it be that this ye Zao was really that good-looking?

“Zhao Xueyin revealed a bitter smile. “Take the same gown for example. I look like a clown when I wear it, and she is as noble as a princess.” ”

“Hearing this, Jiang Xiaoyu frowned. “She wears the same gown as you?” ”

“Yes.”

The anger on Jiang Xiaoyu’s face became even more obvious. “She did it on purpose!”Who would choose to wear the same gown as a guest at a banquet?

It was obvious that she was deliberately causing trouble!

It seemed that ye Zhuo was not someone who would behave himself!

Zhao Xueyin shook her head. “I don’t think so. She and I are just competitors. There’s no need for her to outdress me.”

“Zhao Xueyin’s assistant immediately saw an opening and jumped in. “Miss Zhao, there are already two people saying that she did it on purpose. Please don’t defend her!” ”

“Two people?”Jiang Xiaoyu raised her head curiously. “Who else besides me?”

“The assistant continued, “And Mr. Si thinks so too.” ”

“Si Lui wasn’t someone who couldn’t differentiate between black and white. Since he said so, then ye Zhuo must have done it on purpose. ”

“Seeing the change in Jiang Xiaoyu’s expression, the assistant continued, “Miss Jiang, you don’t know! Ever since this miss ye returned, the Shunxi Financial Group has completely lost Miss Zhao’s position! Just yesterday, Miss ye actually made Miss Zhao...” ”

“Stop talking!”Zhao Xueyin interrupted the assistant in time.

“Speak! Continue Talking!”Jiang Xiaoyu looked at the assistant.

The assistant was in a bit of a dilemma.

“Jiang Xiaoyu said, “It’s fine if you continue talking! If Xueyin deducts your salary, I’ll make it up to you!” ” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Zhao Xueyin immediately followed by saying, “Xiaoyu, don’t ask! It’s actually nothing! The Shunxi Financial Group was left to her by Miss Ye’s great-great-grandfather to begin with. It’s only right for her to make me do whatever she wants!” ”

“”Three years have passed, and you still look so easy to bully!”Jiang Xiaoyu was a little disappointed. She turned to her assistant and said, “Continue.” ”

“The assistant looked at Zhao Xueyin and then at Jiang Xiaoyu, not knowing how to speak. ”

“Jiang Xiaoyu frowned and said, “Tell me quickly!” ”

“The assistant couldn’t care about anything else. She took a deep breath, then, he said, “Miss Jiang, you’re right. Miss Zhao is just too kind, that’s why she was bullied!”! On the first day that Miss Ye returned to the consortium, she fired Miss Sun and Liu Neng, the director of the planning department. All of this was nothing. She even asked Miss Zhao to write a 3,000-word self-criticism report to her!” ”

“What?”Jiang Xiaoyu was in a bad mood. “This wild girl from who knows where is she so arrogant!”

She actually dared to ask Zhao Xueyin to write a self-reflection report!

How hateful!

The assistant sighed. “Everyone in the Financial Group is worried about their safety. They’re afraid that they’ll lose their jobs if they offend Miss Ye!”
