“”I’m just having a cup of coffee!”Ye Sen continued, “Sis, do you have to make such a fuss?” ”

“Just come with me!”Ye Shu grabbed ye Sen’s arm.

“Ye Sen turned around and looked at the coffee shop, feeling very uncomfortable. ”

What if gu dening and Chu Jie really succeeded? What would he do then?

No!

Such a thing must never happen!

“”SIS, I don’t think Chu Jie and dening are suitable for each other,”ye sen continued, “Dening can’t handle the Chu family!” ”

“The Chu family had a complicated background in Beijing, and it was a bit mysterious! ”

Especially since Chu Jie was a direct descendant of the Chu family.

The head of the Chu family was called Chu Jin.

“Not only was he the founder of theking company, but he was also the eldest daughter-in-law of the Mo family. ”

“Even though the Chu family had kept a low profile all these years, the legend that belonged to the Chu family was still there. ”

“”You’re not De Ning. How do you know that she can’t handle the Chu Family?”Ye Shu continued, “It’s fine if you’re not willing to go on a blind date! But now you’re still causing trouble here! Ye Sen, let me ask you, what do you mean?” ”

Ye Sen glanced at ye Shu but did not say anything.

His heart was stifled.

“Ye Shu narrowed her eyes and continued, “Oh! I know. Are you interested in De Ning?” ”

“Hearing this, ye Sen quickly denied, “I’m not! I’m Not! Don’t talk nonsense!” ” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Ye Shu sized up ye Sen and continued, “If that’s really the case, then you deserve it! You were the one who sat with De Ning on the blind date today! You were the one who personally pushed De Ning out!” ”

Ye Sen sighed in his heart.

He was also regretting it!

“Ye Shu continued, “Alright, Hurry to the company!” ”

“”Sister, What About You?”Ye Sen turned to look at Ye Shu. ”

“Ye Shu continued, “I’ll find a place to sit for a while. When they come out, I’ll ask about the situation.” ”

“”Anyway, I’m not busy today. I’ll sit with you!”Ye Sen held ye Shu’s arm. “Sister, didn’t you say that you want to buy a dog? I know a pet shop nearby. Do you want to go take a look now?” ”

“Okay.”Ye Shu nodded. “Then I’ll send a message to De Ning.”

The two of them came to the pet shop.

Ye Sen was not interested in cats and dogs. He stood by the door and watched the situation in the coffee shop across from him.

What were the two of them talking about inside?

Why didn’t they come out?

Ye Sen was a little anxious.

“Ye Shu picked up a chubby husky. “Ye Sen, what do you think of this one?” ”

“Ye Sen gave it a perfunctory look. “Not bad, not bad.” ”

“The shop owner smiled and recommended, “Madam, your taste is really good. This dog is called a Husky. It’s a Siberian sled dog. Because it has one-tenth of the blood of a wolf, an adult husky is very similar to a wolf...” ”

“Hearing this, Ye Shu frowned slightly. “Is it aggressive?” ”

“”No, don’t worry,”the owner continued, “Purebred Huskies are mild-mannered. Other than being a little naughty, it’s not aggressive. Young people nowadays especially like to raise it. It’s definitely not wrong for you to choose it.” ”

Ye Shu hugged the chubby little guy. “Why do I feel that its eyes look a little silly?”

Silly?

“The shop owner smiled and said, “This is called silly! Look at it, it’s so chubby and cute!” ”

“”Cute is pretty cute.”Ye Shu nodded and continued, “How much is it?” ”

“1500. You can just take it back after you pay. We dogs have been vaccinated.”

“It’s not expensive.”Ye Shu turned to look at ye Sen. “How about I buy this one?”

“Ye Sen’s mind was completely focused on the coffee shop across the street. He only heard the word ‘buy’and immediately took out his phone. “Boss, pay with Alipay!” ”

Ye Shu:”...”she asked Lonesome.

“The shop owner smiled and went forward. “Sir, pay here.” ”

Ye Sen went over to pay.

“Ye Shu continued, “Pay later and pick some dog food. Boss, I’ve never had a dog before. Can you recommend some dog food?” ”

“The shop owner saw that Ye Shu wasn’t poor, so he recommended all the expensive dog food. ”

“In the end, Ye Shu bought some dog food and dog snacks. With some toys and kennels, it was more than four thousand yuan. ”

Ye Sen was responsible for paying.

“Watching Ye Sen and Ye Shu leave, the shop owner smiled and said, “I finally sold that Husky!” ”

“After all, Huskies had other titles besides huskies, such as “Let go”, “Demolition director”, “Demolition Maniac”... ”

“If she couldn’t sell them, she might not even be able to keep her pet shop. ”
