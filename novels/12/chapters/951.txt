Translator: 549690339

“Zhou Rui looked at Cen Yuyan and said, “Yuyan, they are your family after all. Everything they say is for your own good. Don’t be angry. After all, they are different from you. The two of us have been together for a long time. You know my character and know that I won’t lie to you, but they are not you. “Let’s kneel for a while longer! “Perhaps they will agree to us being together after they go back! “Moreover, without a marriage certificate, our child will be born into an illegal household. Can you bear to see our child not even have his own household registration?” ”

“No matter what, Cen Yuyan was the Cen family’s blood. Zhou Rui did not believe that the Cen family would give up on Cen Yuyan. ”

Especially since Cen Yuyan was already pregnant.

He was doing this to scare Cen Yuyan and at the same time to test his sincerity towards Cen Yuyan.

How could he be tested so easily?

“If he really took Cen Yuyan away at this time, then his efforts would be for naught. ”

Cen Yuyan looked at Zhou Rui with a moved expression.

She did not expect Zhou Rui to still speak up for the Cen family at this time.

“Even if the Cen family called Zhou Rui a gigolo, Zhou Rui did not care. ”

But the CEN family did not know how to cherish Zhou Rui at all.

“After all, a good son-in-law like Zhou Rui could not be found even if he had a lantern. ”

Cen Yuyan sniffled. “I just feel that this is too unfair to you.”

“Zhou rui smiled and said, “Silly, what kind of unfair treatment is this? If you want to talk about unfair treatment, you should be the one who has been wronged. You’re still pregnant with a child. It’s my fault for being incompetent. It’s my fault for letting you and the child down. If I could obtain the recognition of your family, we wouldn’t have to kneel here now.” ”

“Hearing this, Cen Yuyan’s heart was filled with guilt. ”

She was the one who should apologize.

But Zhou Rui apologized instead.

Meeting Zhou Rui was simply the greatest luck in her life.

“Cen Yuyan held Zhou Rui’s hand. “Zhou Rui, don’t worry. I will definitely kneel here with you until they agree to our marriage.” ”

“”Yuyan, thank you.” ”

“The one who should say thank you is me.”

The Cen family.

“When Old Madam Cen heard about this matter, there was no special expression on her face. She only turned to look at Zhou Xiang. “Xiangxiang, follow me to the police station.” ”

Zhou Xiang nodded. “Okay.”

“Why do you want to go to the police station?”Cen Yueya asked.

“Old Mrs. Cen said, “Move the fourth servant girl’s Hukou out.” ”

“Cen Yueying raised her head in surprise. “Grandma, are you really going to move Yuyan’s hukou out?” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen sighed. “She chose her own path. Since she likes Zhou Rui so much and wants to get married to him, then I’ll fulfill her wish.” ”

“Hearing the affirmative answer, Cen Yueying felt a little uncomfortable. ”

This fourth girl was really too insensible!

She couldn’t blame anyone for creating such a situation.

“When Old Mrs. Cen and Zhou Xiang took the car out, Zhou Rui and Cen Yuyan were still kneeling on the ground. ”

“Seeing the Cen family’s car come out, Zhou Rui narrowed his eyes. ”

What was the Cen family planning?

Could it be that they were going to look for Cen Shaoqing for a discussion?

“After all, getting married was a major event. ”

“Moreover, Cen Yuyan was the only daughter of the Cen family who had yet to get married. ”

“When that time came, their wedding would definitely shake the entire city! ”

“When he thought of that scene, Zhou Rui’s heart beat extremely fast. ”

“Soon, he would be the Cen family’s legitimate son-in-law. ”

“At this moment, a cold and indifferent daughter appeared in the air. “Yuyan!” ”

Cen Yuyan raised her head and saw that it was Cen Yuyan.

“Third sister.”

“Cen Yuyan couldn’t bear to see Cen Yuyan being chased out of the house. She continued, “Get up. I have something to tell you.” ”

“”Third sister, if you have something to say, just tell me here.” ”

CEN yueying frowned. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Zhou rui smiled and said, “Yuyan, go quickly.” ”

Only then did Cen Yuyan stand up and follow Cen Yueying’s footsteps.

“The two of them came to the lounge next to the manor. “Yuyan, Grandma, Mom, and our three older sisters’words are like a whisper in your ear. To that Zhou Rui’s words, it’s like an imperial edict! Don’t you think you’re being very foolish?” ”

“Cen Yuyan frowned. “Third sister, if you called me over just to say these words to me, then I feel that the two of us should have nothing more to say.” ”

“Seeing Cen Yuyan like this, Cen Yueying also held back a breath in her heart. She was the Cen family’s third elder and had grown up next to Cen Yuyan. She didn’t want to see Cen Yuyan do something that she would regret too much. ”

There was everything in this world.

Only there was no medicine for regret.
