“Chapter 545: 136: an unexpected turn of events. So it was the little fanboy, Feng Xianxian, who was on the verge of collapse. She noticed the health-preserving soup! 7”

“The old man turned around slightly. Actually, she was not that old. She was at most in her early fifties, but her hair was too white.”

She was the lady boss of the private restaurant for half a month.

Aunt Lang.

“Aunt Lang turned around to look at the young woman. “Weiyue, help me thank your mother.””

“Xi Weiyue smiled faintly. “We’re all family, aunt, you don’t have to be so polite.””

Family?

Were they really family?

A sarcastic look flashed across Aunt Lang’s eyes before disappearing.

“XI weiyue continued, “Aunt, do you Miss Sister Half Moon?””

Aunt Lang did not say a word as she picked up a piece of hibiscus cake.

Her Little Half Moon had already left her for 36 years.

She wondered if she would be able to wait for her daughter in her lifetime...

“It had been thirty-three years, even though she had never given up on looking for her daughter.”

Unfortunately.

There was still no news of her.

“Seeing Aunt Lang like this, xi weiyue continued, “Aunt, then I won’t bother you anymore.””

Aunt Lang still did not say anything. She was lost in her thoughts as she looked at the lilies blooming by the roadside.

Xi Weiyue returned to the attic.

Her parents were waiting for her in the living room.

“Xi Weiyue’s mother, Yang Jiao, was 40 years old this year, but due to her good foundation and maintenance, she looked only around 30 years old.”

“When she saw Xi Weiyue return, Yang Jiao asked impatiently, “How is it, Weiyue? Did Your Aunt Tell You?””

Xi Weiyue shook her head.

“Yang Jiao frowned and turned to look at Xi Muwen beside her, “Logically speaking, Weiyue looks the most like that child. She should really like our Weiyue! How could she not say anything! ! Do you think she wants to keep that secret and bring it underground? “Ye Langhua’s body is deteriorating year by year. If something really happens, wouldn’t we be wasting our efforts?””

His words were filled with worry.

“Xi Muwen narrowed his eyes. “There’s no rush. When the time comes, she’ll definitely say it.””

Xi Muwen and Yang Jiao were 23 years apart.

“From the looks of it, the two did not look like a couple but more like father and daughter.”

“How long will it take?”Yang Jiao was still a little anxious. “What if she doesn’t say anything? Are you willing to let those things be taken underground by her?” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Xi Muwen lit a cigar and sat on the sofa, puffing out smoke. “You have to know that haste makes waste. Similarly, haste makes waste!””

Xi Weiyue nodded. “I think father is right.”

“Yang Jiao rolled her eyes at the father and daughter. “Fine, fine, fine! Then just wait and see. Wait for her to take the initiative to tell you that you’re not in a hurry now. When the time comes, just don’t regret it!””

Xi Muwen waved his hand. “A woman’s opinion!”

...

At the Lin family home.

“Lin Jincheng and ye Shu had just reached home when Zhao shuning came over. “Fifth sister-in-law, MOM is calling for you.””

“Ye Shu nodded. “Okay, I’ll be right there.””

“Zhao shuning looked at Ye Shu, his eyes filled with disgust. “Then hurry up. Don’t make mom wait for You!””

She really couldn’t understand why Lin Jincheng would fall for ye Shu.

“Other than that face, what else could she compare to Feng Qianhua?”

It was disgusting to see her!

Lin Jincheng held ye Shu’s hand. “I think I’ll go with you.”

Ye Shu shook her head. “No need. I can do it myself.”

Lin Jincheng was a little worried. “My mom can be especially harsh sometimes...”

“”Don’t worry, I can handle it.”Ye Shu continued, “You can’t always be by my side. I have to learn how to handle these things.””

“In the past year, Ye Shu had experienced a lot.”

She had also grown a lot.

“Lin Jincheng continued, “Then be careful.””

“Okay.”Ye Shu nodded and went to the courtyard where Old Lady Lin lived.

“Old Lady Lin was sitting on the armchair in front of the hall. When she saw ye Shu coming over, her eyes were filled with viciousness.”

B * Tch!

It was all her fault!

“Not only did she steal Feng Qianhua’s position, but she also stirred up trouble in front of Lin Jincheng.”

“If it weren’t for that B * Tch Ye Shu, would she have gotten to where she was today with Lin Jincheng and his mother?”

“Facing Old Lady Lin, ye Shu really couldn’t call her ‘mother’. After all, if it weren’t for Old Lady Lin, she wouldn’t have been separated from Lin Ze and his mother for nineteen years.”

“But if Old Lady Lin didn’t pick on her, she would also be nice to her. “Why did you call me here?””

Old Lady Lin did not have a good attitude towards ye Shu and went straight to the point. “Come with me to the Public Security Bureau tomorrow. I want to change my granddaughter’s name!”

“Change her name?”Ye Shu frowned. “You want to change her name?”

“”Yes!”Old Lady Lin continued, “I have already thought of her name. In the future, my granddaughter will have my surname! Her name will be Zhao Linzhuo!””
