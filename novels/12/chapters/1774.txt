Translator: 549690339

But Can the dead be resurrected?

Or can that lowly human do it?

“Thinking of that lowly human, Qiu Di’s eyes were filled with mockery. ”

Qiu Chang Zhen was old and muddle-headed. He actually thought that a lowly human would affect her!

“Qiu Di turned to look at Qiu Chang Zhen. “Father, don’t worry about this and that. Just Wait for me to ascend to the throne.”At that time, their Qiu clan would be the number one family in changyue! ”

As for those people in the Ye clan’s team?

“Without ye Zhuo’s leadership and the Ye clan’s team, they were nothing to be afraid of. ”

“Seeing that his only daughter was so outstanding, Qiu Chang Zhen was extremely gratified. His eyes were filled with satisfaction as he looked at Qiu Di. ”

“”Little Di, as long as you know what you’re doing.”Qiu Chang Zhen continued, “In short, don’t let anyone obstruct your path.” ”

“Okay.”Qiu Di nodded.

“Currently, in Chang Yue, who else could surpass her? ”

She was the existence of the strongest King!

“”Oh right, there’s one more thing I forgot to tell you,”Qiu Changzhen said. ”

“What is it?”Qiu Di asked.

“Qiu Changzhen said, “That low-level human is currently trying to change Mars.” ”

Change Mars?

Qiu Di laughed out loud.

“”Father, do you think it’s necessary to tell me about this?” ”

What kind of place was Mars?

Mars was the same as Earth in the past. There was a higher-tech civilization on Mars. The current Mars had no value at all. It was just an abandoned planet.

“If that low-level human was really that powerful, he would not have wasted his time and effort to change Mars. ”

Ye Zhuo was dead!

The rest were just low-level replicas.

There was nothing to be afraid of.

“”Father, there’s no need for you to waste your time on such meaningless things.”From Qiu Di’s point of view, Qiu Changzhen was just worrying over nothing. ”

“After saying that, Qiu di continued, “If there’s nothing else, I’ll be leaving first.” ”

“Qiu Changzhen nodded. “Okay, you go ahead and do your work.” ”

Autumn flute turned around and left.

“Wu Han was still standing at the door waiting for her. When he saw autumn flute coming over, Wu Han immediately followed her footsteps. “Eldest miss.” ”

“Okay.”Autumn flute nodded slightly. “How are the preparations for the general election coming along?”

“”Everything has been prepared. You Don’t have to worry,”Wu Han said. ”

“”Very good.”Autumn flute nodded in satisfaction. “When I ascend to the throne, what rewards do you want?” ”

“Wu Han looked at Qiu di and said, “Wu Han doesn’t want any reward. He only wants to keep eldest miss safe and sound for a hundred years.” ”

“Hearing this, Yuan Yi had a complicated expression on her face. ”

What kind of freak was this Wu Han?

“It was one thing if his origin was unknown, but now he actually said such a thing! ”

“As a person, who didn’t have the ambition to achieve fame? ”

But what about Wu Han?

“Wu Han said that he didn’t want anything, only wanted to keep the autumn flute for a hundred years without worry... ... ”

“If he hadn’t heard it with his own ears, Yuan Yi would never believe that someone could say such words. ”

Could it be that Wu Han was an admirer of the autumn flute?

The autumn flute had the title of the second most beautiful woman in the country of Chang Yue.

“Ever since that person left, the autumn flute had gone from the second most beautiful woman to the first. It was currently in the limelight. In the next general election, if nothing unexpected happened, the autumn flute would definitely be crowned as the king, no less than that person from before. ”

Autumn flute was also very satisfied with Wu Han’s answer.

Ye Zao probably wouldn’t know until he died that Wu Han would become her most loyal supporter!

“Let’s go back.”Autumn flute turned her head.

“Yes.”Wu Han said respectfully.

The two of them walked into the aircraft. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Autumn flute sat in the sterile room, her eyes slightly squinting. ”

“Actually, autumn town’s worries weren’t completely unreasonable. ”

“At this time, there could not be the slightest mistake. ”

“Qiu Di pressed the influence button on the seat and continued, “Wu Han.” ”

“”Young miss, I’m here.”Wu Han’s voice came from the communicator. ”

“Qiu di continued, “Go to the research institute.” ”

“Yes.”

She had to personally go to the research institute to take a look.

Only by seeing it with her own eyes could she be at ease.

What if that low-level human on Earth was really ye Zhuo?

Ye Zhuo was a cheap bastard!

“As long as she was left with a sliver of hope, she would be able to survive. ”

Wu Han immediately changed the flight path of the aircraft.

“The aircraft’s speed was very fast, and it would arrive at the research institute in an hour. ”

The director of the Research Institute was ye Zhuo.

Now That Ye Zhuo wasn’t around.

The person in charge of the research institute had already become Ye Ling.

“When she heard that Qiu Di had come over, Ye Ling had already been waiting at the entrance of the research institute. ”

“When she saw Qiu di alighting from the aircraft, Ye Ling immediately went up to greet her. “Miss Qiu.” ”

Qiu Di nodded. “Is everything ready?”
