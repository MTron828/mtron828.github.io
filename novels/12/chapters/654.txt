“”It’s just a small matter.”Liu Caiyi smiled. “Miss Feng, I have great confidence in you. Good luck.” ”

“Feng Xianxian thought that after tonight, she would never be able to enter the literary world again. She did not expect that there would always be a way. ”

“Although she would not be able to become master Yu’s disciple tonight, after the assessment, she would still be able to dazzle master Yu! She would make master Yu regret not taking her in as his disciple tonight! ”

“She wanted to let Master Yu know that other than her, no one else could bring glory to the literary world! ”

It was even more impossible for ye Zhuo to do so!

12:30 pm.

The banquet continued.

The banquet did not end until around 1 pm.

Ye Zhuo followed behind Master Yu to send off the guests.

“After sending off the last few seniors, master Yu told ye Zhuo about the assessment. “Zhuo Zhuo, I’ll get Xiao Ma to send you the assessment rules when we get back. You should go back and think about it carefully.” ”

Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Alright.”

“After saying that, ye Zao continued, “Master, you seem to have forgotten something, right?” ”

“Master Yu was stunned for a moment before laughing out loud. “Don’t worry, I’ll remember this! I Won’t forget it!” ”

“After saying that, master Yu looked at Assistant Ma beside him. “Xiao Ma, go and bring me the things that I’ve prepared.” ”

“Alright.”

“Very soon, assistant Ma walked over with a very high-end packaging box in his hands. ”

“Master Yu continued, “Zhuozhuo, this is known as the world’s most delicious dessert. Take it home and enjoy it slowly.” ”

“Ye Zhuo took it with both hands and said, “Then I won’t stand on ceremony with you.” ”

...

“On the other side, Old Lady Lin had already arrived home. ”

“Ye Zao had made her lose so much face in front of Feng Qianxian today. At this moment, Old Lady Lin was filled with a belly full of anger. ”

“If ye Zao had not interfered, master Yu would definitely have taken Feng Qianxian as his disciple. ”

“Thinking of Feng Qianxian’s aggrieved look, Old Lady Lin was both angry and uncomfortable. ”

“Ye Zao had just stepped into the Lin family manor when Old Lady Lin called out to him, “Zao Zao.” ”

“What’s the matter?”

Old Lady Lin was furious when she saw ye Zao’s face. She wished she could slap him.

But she couldn’t.

She had to endure it for Feng Xianxian.

“Old Lady Lin looked at Ye Zao and tried her best to suppress the anger in her heart. A kind smile appeared on her face. “Zao Zao, good child. Come in with Grandma for a moment. Grandma has something to tell you.” ”

Good Child?

Ye Zao did not expect to hear these three words from Old Lady Lin One day.

Ye Zao was a little curious about what Old Lady Lin was up to. He turned around and followed Old Lady Lin’s footsteps.

The two of them came to the main hall of the western courtyard.

“Old Lady Lin pointed at the dessert on the table and said, “Zao Zao, I heard that you like desserts. Grandma specially asked someone to make this for you.” ”

“Looking at this plate of desserts, ye Zhonghua chuckled. ”

“What are you laughing at?”

Ye Zhonghua raised her eyebrows slightly. “I’m laughing at the Sun rising from the West today.”

“She had been back to the Lin family for so long, but Old Lady Lin had never given her a good look. Not only did she treat her to desserts today, she even called her a good child. It was really rare. ”

“Old Lady Lin Glanced at ye Zhonghua and said with a smile, “Look at how you talk, child. I’m your grandmother. It’s my duty to treat you well!” ”

“Ye Zao continued, “I won’t eat the desserts. If you have something to say, say it.” ”

“Old Lady Lin felt that ye Zao did not know what was good for him. She was kind enough to treat ye Zao to desserts, but ye Zao did not appreciate her kindness. A wild girl was a wild girl. She was not something that could be put on the table! ”

“”Then I’ll say it directly.”After saying that.., old Lady Lin continued, “I hope that you can break up with Shaoqing because you and Shaoqing are not suitable for each other at all. It’s better to put off the pain for a while. It’s better to cut the Gordian knot quickly.” ”

Only Feng Xianxian was the most suitable person for CEN Shaoqing. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Ye Zao never expected that Old Lady Lin would say such a thing. His expression did not change as he pointed outside the window and said, “Look, the sky is still bright outside.” ”

Old Lady Lin was stunned. “What do you mean?”

Ye Zao smiled slightly. “It’s daytime now. It’s not suitable to dream.”

Dream?

Ye Zao actually dared to say that he was dreaming!

“Old Lady Lin was furious, but she had no choice but to hold it in, she sighed and said, “Zao Zao, I know that you blame Grandma. You blame Grandma For Not Liking You! Actually, the person that Grandma dotes on the most is you! Which person doesn’t like their own granddaughter! Grandma is strict with you for your own good! As the saying goes, the rod begets the filial son! Grandma hopes you can understand Grandma!” ”

Ye Zhuo just quietly watched Old Mrs. Lin Act.
