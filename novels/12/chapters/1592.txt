“Cui smiled and said, “Okay, old lady.” ”

“Soon, the car arrived outside the manor. ”

“Old Lady Cen opened the car door and looked at Baizhi. She moved her lips as if she wanted to say something, but when faced with Baizhi, she couldn’t say anything. ”

It was a very strange feeling.

“There were obviously thousands of words, but her throat seemed to be blocked by something. Such an obscure feeling could only be understood by those who had experienced it. It was impossible to describe it with boring words. ”

“Seeing Old Mrs. Cen, Baizhi was stunned for a moment. After a while, she slowly said, “Sister...” ”

“This “Sister”was neither light nor light, but it resolved the grudge between the two sisters over the years. ”

Old Mrs. Cen’s mood also collapsed with this “Sister”and she ran over. “Xiaozhi!”

The two sisters hugged each other tightly.

“At this moment, it was as if someone had pressed the pause button in the air and was very moved. ”

“”Xiaozhi, I’m sorry, I’m sorry...”Old Mrs. Cen’s voice was close to choking. ”

“Baizhi was also very uncomfortable and almost had tears streaming down her face. “No, sister. I should be the one apologizing to you. It’s my sister who is insensible...” ”

The two sisters apologized to each other. Both of them were apologizing for their actions in the past.

“Because of a misunderstanding, the two sisters had not seen each other for nearly twenty years. Time passed quickly, and the years had taken away their grudges, leaving wrinkles all over their faces. ”

“”Stinky Girl, You Stinky Girl.”Old Mrs. Cen smiled with tears in her eyes. “How did you become so old? So old that I don’t even dare to recognize you!” ”

“In her mind, Baizhi was beautiful and moving. It had been twenty years since she last saw her. It was as if a lifetime had passed, and her beauty had also become old. ”

“Seeing Baizhi become like this, old Mrs. Cen felt very sorry for her, and her heart was filled with regret. ” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“When she was young, she had been too competitive. This was her biological sister. ”

How could she bear not to see Baizhi for so many years.

Baizhi broke into a smile through her tears. “You talk as if you’re not old. You’re also so old that you look terrible!”

“Old Mrs. Cen snorted. “Silly girl, we haven’t seen each other for so many years, but your mouth is still so vicious!” ”

“In a trance, the two sisters seemed to have returned to the past. ”

“Ye Zhuo looked at the two of them with a faint smile on his face. He continued, “Grandma Cen, aunt, little uncle, it’s cold outside. Let’s talk inside.” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen nodded. “Yes, yes, yes. Let’s talk inside.” ”

“After a while, old Mrs. Cen turned to look at her uncle and said in surprise, “Ah! Liu De, why are you so Old?” ”

Uncle Liu de smiled and didn’t say anything.

“When Liu De was young, he was very reserved. He was embarrassed to talk to girls his age. Even when he was old, he couldn’t get rid of this habit. ”

“Baizhi looked at Old Mrs. Cen and said somewhat speechlessly, “We’re both old. If he’s not old, won’t he become an old monster?” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen snorted. “You Stinky Girl, you’re still the same as before. You only know how to Talk Back to me! Don’t you know that elder sister is like a Mother?” ”

“Baizhi held old Mrs. Cen’s arm and tilted her head on old Mrs. Cen’s shoulder with a smile. “Sister, this is really good.” ”

“Silly girl!”Old Mrs. Cen poked Baizhi’s head.

“How Old Am I? How can you still call me that? !”

“Old Mrs. Cen rolled her eyes. “No matter how old you are, you’re still my sister! A Little Brat!” ”

Baizhi was more than ten years younger than old Mrs. Cen.

“In Old Mrs. Cen’s life, a sister was always a sister. Unfortunately, she had not done her duty as an elder sister all these years. ”

“Thinking of this, the expression in old Mrs. Cen’s eyes dimmed a little. ”

“Baizhi seemed to have seen the emotion in Old Mrs. Cen’s eyes and continued, “Elder sister, let bygones be bygones. I was too stubborn in the past...” ”

Old Mrs. Cen patted Baizhi’s hand. Everything was said without saying.

The two of them chatted and laughed as they got into the car.

At the Cen House.

Old Mrs. Cen instructed the servants to pour tea.

“Baizhi asked curiously, “Where’s your daughter-in-law?” ”

“She’s not at home.”Old Mrs. Cen picked up a cup of tea. “She went on a trip abroad with a group of young sisters on the second day of the New Year. She’ll probably be back in a few days.”

“Baizhi asked, “So you’re the only one at home these days?” ”

“Yes.”Old Mrs. Cen nodded.

“Aren’t you bored at home by yourself?”Baizhi asked.

“”I’m not bored,”old Mrs. Cen continued, “We have a lot of relatives. We’re so busy with the new year greetings today and the New Year Greetings Tomorrow! We don’t have time to be bored!” ”

“Baizhi nodded with a smile and continued, “Sister, you’ve Changed a lot. Not only have you become older, but your character has also changed!” ”
