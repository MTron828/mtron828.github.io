On the other side.

S galaxy.

The main alliance country.

The main alliance country controlled the three big countries in the S galaxy.

“These three big countries were: Changyue Country, the Bug clan, and Manxing country. ”

“Among them, the changyue country managed by Ye Zhuo was ranked first, followed by the Bug clan, and then the Manxing country. ”

“All these years, the Bug clan had always wanted to annex the CHANGYUE country. ”

“But there was a jinx in the Chang Yue country, and even the ambitious bug clan did not dare to provoke it. ”

“”Great Elder,”the Chief Alliance’s National Advisor turned to look at the great elder beside him. ”

“What is it?”The great elder turned back.

“The national advisor stroked his white beard and continued, “You see, isn’t it time to bring the young master back?” ”

“The great elder narrowed his eyes, “Now is not the time.” ”

“Why?”The imperial tutor asked.

“The great elder continued, “The young master has not established a family yet.” ”

“”Not established a family yet?”The imperial tutor stood up from his chair and said incredulously, “If I remember correctly, the young master has already reached the age of 30, right?” ”

“According to common sense, under normal circumstances, the young master should have established a family at the age of 30. ”

“He was already 30 years old, yet he still hadn’t started a family and started a business! ”

“The great elder nodded, “The young master is already 30 years old.” ”

“”Then why hasn’t he started a family and started a business?”The national master asked worriedly, “Is there a problem?” ”

“”There’s no problem at all, it’s just that he has seen through the secular world!”The Great Elder said. ”

“Seen through the secular world? become a monk?”The National Master asked. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The Imperial preceptor never expected that the future crown prince of the main alliance country would actually see through the secular world!

This...

Wasn’t this a joke?

“En.”The great elder nodded. “But don’t worry. Young master should have already returned to normal by now.”

“”Should?”The imperial preceptor frowned slightly, “You’re telling me that such a big matter should be? Why didn’t you send a few people down to keep an eye on young master? What if the young master has really seen through the mortal world? I’ve already said that I shouldn’t have left the young master on Earth back then! What should I do now? The country can not be without a ruler for a day!” ”

“If he didn’t leave the young master alone on Earth, he wouldn’t have seen through the mortal world either. ”

“If the young master had really shaved his head, he couldn’t possibly pull a monk over to take charge of the overall situation, right? ”

“”Not leaving the young master on Earth? Then where do you want to leave the young master?”The great elder sighed. “Besides, do you think that I can’t think of a way that you can think of?” ”

“What do you mean?”The Imperial preceptor asked.

“The great elder continued, “The people I sent over were all discovered by the young master!” ”

He even suspected that the young master had discovered the secret of the s galaxy.

The general alliance had always had a rule.

The future General Alliance had to be put on Earth to train until after they got married and had children.

“After they got married and had children, they would leave the young master on Earth, and so on. ”

“To a high-level galaxy, earth was no different from hell. ”

“How could this be?”The imperial preceptor frowned.

“Logically speaking, the bloodline of the General Alliance in the young master’s body had not awakened yet, so he should not have discovered the people sent by the Great Elder. ”

“”But it’s normal to be discovered. After all, that’s our young master! “Even if his bloodline is sealed, he’s still much more powerful than an ordinary person!”The great elder continued, “In short, we can’t act rashly now. The General Alliance is still in good health. It’s fine even if we bring the young master back later.” ”

The grand elder nodded.

This was the only thing they could do now.

“A moment later, the grand elder seemed to have thought of something and continued, “What if the young master has really seen through the mortal world?” ”

“The grand elder continued, “According to the last message from Earth, the young master has already found his right-hand woman!” ”

“Really?”A look of surprise appeared in the Grand Elder’s eyes.

“As long as they met the right-hand woman, they would not be far from getting married and having children. ”

“At that time, they could directly bring the young master to the s galaxy. ”

“Yes.”The grand elder nodded.

“Unfortunately, the core robots that he sent over later were all discovered by the young master. ”

“After the core robots were discovered, in order to be discovered by others, they would immediately enter the destruction mode. ”

“”That’s good.”The national advisor heaved a sigh of relief and continued, “I told you, how could young master see through the mortal world!”After all, he was the Chief Alliance leader! ”

...

The Cen family.

“Old Mrs. Cen comforted Zhou Xiang for a long while before she finally managed to coax Zhou Xiang into a genuine smile. “Mom, don’t worry, i...” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen nodded. “If that’s the case, then don’t do it again in the future! I’ll go down and listen to the play first.” ”

“Go ahead.”

“Looking at the Cen Old Lady’s departing back, Zhou Xiang sighed with emotion. ”
