“CEN Shaoqing said, “But I knew you before he did.” ”

Ye Zhuo was noncommittal. “I know that you’re concerned about me. Don’t worry. Song Shiyu is a gentleman. He will never bully me.”

“”You can’t judge a book by its cover,”Cen Shaoqing said. “In any case, you’re not allowed to spend the night with him.” ”

“”You’re restricting my personal freedom,”ye Zao said. ”

“CEN Shaoqing said, “I’m concerned about you.” ”

Ye Zao looked at Cen Shaoqing. “Thank you for your concern. I don’t need it.”

“”You’re not allowed to go.”Cen Shaoqing pulled on Ye Zao’s lapel. “Please, don’t go.” ”

“Ye Zao chuckled. “Mr. Cen, if you admit that you’re jealous, I Won’t go.” ”

“Really?”Cen Shaoqing’s eyes lit up as he asked.

Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Of course it’s true!”

“CEN shaoqing immediately said, “I admit that I was jealous just now. You’re not allowed to go out with song Shiyu alone in the future.” ”

“Okay.”

“Really?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“Yes.”Ye Zao continued eating the lychees.

“”Leader, eat more. If it’s not enough, I’ll Peel it for you.”CEN Shaoqing continued, “Let’s Go See My Friend Tomorrow?” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded.

The next day.

Ye Zhuo got up early in the morning.

Cen Shaoqing had already gotten someone to prepare breakfast.

“Ye Zhuo went to the gym for a walk, then came to the restaurant to eat. He looked up at Cen Shaoqing, who was sitting there reading the newspaper. “Where did you meet your friend?” ”

“”Penglai Island,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“What Time?”Ye Zhuo continued to ask.

“”We’re all friends. It doesn’t matter if we go a little later,”Cen Shaoqing replied. ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“After dinner, the two of them left the house at around 8:30 pm. ”

It only took more than half an hour to go to Penglai Island by helicopter.

“Half an hour later, the helicopter landed on a golf course. ”

“To have a private golf course on Penglai Island, one could imagine that Cen Shaoqing’s friend from the temple was not simple. ”

Yu Luonian was a little anxious.

He paced back and forth in the hall.

It had been half an hour since he had agreed to meet Cen Shaoqing.

Cen Shaoqing had not arrived yet.

Could it be that Cen Shaoqing did not want to come?

Yu Luonian frowned slightly.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Just then, the butler jogged over. “Sir! Sir!” ”

“What’s Wrong?”Yu Luonian asked.

“The butler said somewhat excitedly, “CEN fifth master is here.” ”

“Yu Mumu hurriedly asked, “Did he come alone, or did he bring his little girlfriend?” ”

“”CEN fifth master brought a young girl with him,”the housekeeper said. ”

“Yu Mumu was too curious and asked, “What does she look like?” ”

The housekeeper shook his head. “She’s too far away. I couldn’t see clearly.”

Yu Mumu simply didn’t ask anymore and immediately walked towards the hall.

“As soon as he arrived at the hall, he heard footsteps. ”

Yu Luonian took a deep breath and regained his usual calm appearance. He raised his feet and walked out.

“Zixu.”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Luonian.”

“After he said that, CEN Shaoqing continued, “This is my fiancée, Ye Zao. Zao Zao, this is the good friend I told you about, Yu Luonian.” ”

“Ye Zao looked at Yu Luonian and took the initiative to extend his hand. “Hello, Mr. Yu. I Am Ye Zao. The leaves of the leaves are burning brightly.” ”

Yu sunset raised his head to look at Ye Zao.

He was a flower lover. What kind of beauty had he not seen before?

“However, it was the first time Yu sunset had seen someone like ye Zao. ”

Her features were picturesque and could topple countries and cities.

She was indeed not bad-looking.

“However, her appearance was just a skin bag. Who knew what her heart was like? ”

The Roses were very beautiful.

With thorns.

“Yu sunset put away the surprise in his heart and narrowed his eyes without a trace. He reached out to hold ye Zao’s hand. “Yu sunset. Thus, Yu Sunset Day and night, years and years.” ”

“Mr. Yu.”

“Yu Luonian continued, “Please come in.” ”

Cen Shaoqing put his arm around ye Zao’s waist and the two of them walked into the inner room.

Yu Luonian asked someone to serve tea and exquisite snacks.

“”Miss Ye, Zixu and I have been good friends for many years. It’s like our own home here. Miss Ye, please don’t stand on ceremony.” ”

Zixu?

This address seemed a little strange.

Ye Zhuo turned to look at Cen Shaoqing.

“Cen Shaoqing saw her confusion and explained, “Zixu is my word.” ”

It was given to him by a abbot.

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “I see.”

“Yu Muannian continued, “I heard from Zixu that Miss Ye is a few years younger than him?” ”

“Yes.”

“Yu Muannian smiled and said, “Young girls nowadays like uncles. If there’s a suitable girl by Miss Ye’s side, introduce her to me.” ”

“Mr. Yu Single?”Ye Zhuo asked.
