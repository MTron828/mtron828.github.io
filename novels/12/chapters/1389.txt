“Chapter 1390: 286: if he’s not afraid of losing face, What Am I afraid of? 3”

Translator: 549690339

The Wu family had always been very wary of him and did not treat him as part of their family.

This was also the reason why Zhou Zuolong had an affair.

“Xie wanqiu sighed. “Usually, this child Jinbei is quite smart. He’s so wary of me, so why isn’t he wary of Ye Zhuo at all?” ”

Zhou Zuolong was furious. He took out his phone and called Zhou Jinbei.

On the other side.

Zhou Jinbei saw the caller ID. He frowned slightly and hung up.

The other side did not give up and kept calling.

“”Who is it?”Zhou Xiang, who was sitting opposite Zhou Jinbei, asked. ”

“”Don’t worry about it,”Zhou Jinbei said. ”

“Looking at his expression, Zhou Xiang could only come out a little. “Is it our dad?” ”

Zhou Jinbei did not say anything and drank a mouthful of tea.

“Zhou Xiang continued, “Jinbei, you’re already in Beijing. You should go to the hospital to see your parents. Otherwise, it won’t sound good if it gets out.” ”

“Zhou Zuolong isn’t afraid of losing face even if he abandons his wife and child. What am I afraid of?”Zhou Jinbei said.

“”What Zhou Zuolong?”Zhou Xiang frowned slightly and corrected, “That’s our father! How can you call him by his first name?” ”

“”Sister, how you call him is your business. I have no right to interfere.”Zhou Jinbei looked at Zhou Xiang with a serious expression. “In short, in my lifetime, I will never acknowledge him as my father.” ”

Zhou Xiang sighed.

“Zhou jinbei continued, “I have already found an expert to repair the mother’s will. The expert said that it will be repaired in a week.”The reason why Zhou Jinbei did not mention ye Zhuo.., was because he was worried that Zhou Xiang would interfere with the restoration. ”

Zhou Xiang did not think that there was anything wrong with Wu Lan’s death.

“”Jinbei, do you really think that father had something to do with Mother’s death?”Zhou Xiang asked. ”

“When he mentioned Wu Lan’s death, Zhou Jinbei’s expression immediately changed. He felt that it was not worth it for Wu Lan. ”

“”He’s the murderer who directly killed our mother! Back then, mother gave up everything in order to marry him. She didn’t even return after grandmother passed away? But what about him? What did he do?” ”

“Compared to Zhou Jinbei’s excitement, Zhou Xiang was very calm. “What if the will is restored and mother’s death has nothing to do with father? For so many years, you have been falsely accusing him. What are you going to do?” ”

“Falsely accusing? Impossible!”

“Zhou Jinbei had been traveling for so many years. Although he had not collected any useful evidence, he had heard a lot of rumors. ”

“Wu Lan was a good woman with traditional beliefs. She had never spoken to a stranger before, so how could she do such a shocking thing as dying for Love? ”

“Therefore, when everyone heard about this, they were all very surprised and in disbelief. ”

“On the other hand, Zhou Jinbei helped Xie wanqiu up not long after Wu Lan left. ”

“If Zhou Jinbei really loved Wu Lan that much, would he be so impatient? ”

“Zhou Xiang took a sip of tea, “Jinbei, you’re too stubborn. You have a deep prejudice against dad, so you’ve always felt that what happened to mom had something to do with Dad. It’s normal for people to have seven emotions and six desires, no matter what they do... “...”. Although Zhou Xiang was a little surprised at first.., but after a long time, she had experienced many things over the years, so she accepted it. ”

She had seen many examples like this.

“”Sis! I believe in our mother! She isn’t the kind of person who would do such a thing!”Zhou jinbei continued, “You keep saying that Zhou Zuolong had nothing to do with Mom’s death. Then let me ask you, what if it has something to do with it? What would you do if it has something to do with it? Now that the results of the restoration are not out yet, anything is possible!” ”

Zhou Xiang was stunned.

There was a connection?

It was impossible.

“Although Zhou Zuolong was usually not particular, Wu Lan was his first wife. He even went to the extent of getting a vasectomy for Wu Lan. ”

“All along, only women were getting their vasectomies, let alone in that era. If a man went to the hospital for a vasectomy, what kind of disdainful looks would he suffer? ”

Zhou Zuolong was so good to Wu Lan. Why would he do something that would let Wu Lan Down?

“”I won’t. I believe in dad, just like you believe in Mom,”Zhou Xiang said. ”

“At this moment, the phone that finally quieted down rang again. ”

Zhou Jinbei blocked Zhou Zuolong’s phone number.

“Dad is already so old. It’s not easy for him either. Just answer it!”

“We’ll talk about it when the results are out.”Zhou Jinbei pressed the cigarette butt into the Ashtray.

“After saying that, Zhou Jinbei turned around and left. ”

Zhou Xiang looked at Zhou Jinbei’s back and sighed softly.

She did not know when her younger brother would be able to let go of the knot in his heart.

“She was now worried that the relationship between Zhou Zuolong and Zhou Jinbei would deteriorate, but she was also worried that Zhou Zuolong would sever his father-daughter relationship with her. ”

“After all, Zhou Zuolong had said that he would only give her one day. If Cen Shaoqing did not break up with Ye Zhuo, he would sever his father-daughter relationship with her. ”

Wu Lan was dead.

Her grandparents had also left. Zhou Xiang’s uncles and aunts had emigrated abroad in the early years. They had not contacted each other for many years. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“It could be said that other than Zhou Jinbei, Zhou Zuolong was the only person in her mother’s family who was related by blood. ”

She did not want to sever her relationship with Zhou Zuolong.

“If she really severed her relationship, she would not have a father in the future. ”

No.

She had to think of a way. Zhou Xiang sighed again.

“”Xiang Xiang, what’s going on? Why are you sighing so many times in such a short time?”Old Mrs. Cen walked over from the side ”

“Zhou Xiang turned around and smiled. “Mom, it’s nothing.” ”

This was her own matter. She could not let old Mrs. Cen worry about it together with her.

“Moreover, according to Old Mrs. Cen’s personality, she would definitely look for Zhou Zuolong to find an explanation. When the matter became more and more serious, there would really be no end to it. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Xiang Xiang, we are a family. You must not hide anything from me.” ”

“”Yes, I know.”Zhou Xiang nodded. ”

“After saying that, Zhou Xiang picked up the bag on the table. “Mom, I have something to attend to.” ”

“Okay.”Old Mrs. Cen nodded.

“Just as Zhou Xiang walked out of the door, old Mrs. Cen called for the housekeeper. “Get someone to follow Xiang Xiang.” ”

The housekeeper was stunned. “Follow Mrs. Cen?”

“Yes.”Old Mrs. Cen nodded.

“Seeing that old Mrs. Cen did not seem to be joking, the housekeeper continued, “Alright, I’ll make the arrangements right away.” ”

On the other side.

Zhou Jinbei had not picked up his phone the entire time. Zhou Zuolong was so angry that his face had turned red. He wished that he could just throw his phone away. “Unfilial son! Unfilial Son!”

“What’s Wrong?”Xie wanqiu asked with concern.

“Zhou zuolong said, “This unfilial son, he actually did not pick up my call.” ”

“Xie wanqiu said, “Jinbei is probably busy with his business. You can call him later.” ”

“At that moment, there was a knock on the door. ”

Zheng Wanyin jogged over to open the door. “Second aunt!”

“Wanyin.”

“Zheng wanyin continued, “Second aunt, come in quickly.”Then, she raised her voice and shouted, “Grandpa and Grandma, Second Aunt Is Here!” ”

Xie wanqiu smiled and came out to welcome her. “Xiangxiang is here. Come in quickly! Come in quickly!”

“”Mom,”Zhou Xiang called out. ”

“”Hey.”Xie wanqiu saw that Zhou Xiang was still holding something in his hands. “You child, so what if you’re here? Why did you bring anything! You’re not an outsider!” ”
