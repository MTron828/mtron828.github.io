Translator: 549690339

“If Lin Qingxuan dared to marry Xia Xiaoman, it would be because she didn’t want her mother anymore! ”

“Compared to her biological mother, who was more important? ”

“Of course, she was more important! ”

“Moreover, if she didn’t officiate the wedding for Lin Qingxuan, who would officiate the wedding? ”

The reason why Lin Qingxuan came to tell her this was just to scare her. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Did he really dare to marry Xia Xiaoman?

Unless the sun rose from the west!

Old Lady Lin still had this bit of confidence.

Auntie Wang nodded and felt that what Old Lady Lin said made sense.

“She had worked for the Lin family for many years and knew Lin Qingxuan quite well. According to Lin Qingxuan’s character, he really couldn’t do anything against Old Lady Lin. ”

“Old Lady Lin continued, “We haven’t visited Xianxian for a long time. Go and tidy up. We’ll go and visit Xianxian now.” ”

“”Okay.”Auntie Wang continued, “I’ll go right away.” ”

Auntie Wang prepared a lot of food that was still useful. The two of them took a car to Feng Xianxian’s current place.

“After moving out from the affordable residential area, Feng Xianxian now lived in a high-end apartment. ”

“Although the apartment’s environment was not as good as the Feng family’s villa area, the people who came and went here were not ordinary people. They were either white-collar workers or internet celebrities. ”

Old Lady Lin was quite satisfied with the environment here.

“These days, Feng Xianxian had been preparing for the literary world’s assessment competition. ”

She must win against Ye Zhuo!

“At this moment, the doorbell rang in the air. ”

Feng Xianxian jogged over to open the door.

“The moment the door opened, she saw Liu Caiyi dressed in a smart suit. ”

“President Liu.”

“Liu caiyi smiled and said, “How many times have I told you? You can just call me sister Caiyi. How can you still treat me as an outsider?”Liu Caiyi had a righteous heart. After interacting with her for the past few days.., she felt that Feng Xianxian was a very talented person. ”

She would definitely be able to achieve great things in the future!

“And as the next quasi-president of the Chinese arts association, she naturally had to rope in talented people to prepare for the position of president. ”

“”Sister Caiyi.”Feng Xianxian continued, “Come in and take a seat.” ”

Liu Caiyi walked in from outside.

Feng Xianxian poured her a cup of tea.

“Liu CAIYI continued to ask, “How’s your preparation during this period of time?” ”

“Feng Qianqian knew that Liu Caiyi was asking about the assessment competition, so she replied, “It’s not bad.” ”

“Liu Caiyi knew that Feng Qianqian was different from ye Zao. Feng Qianqian was the type of person who did not reveal anything. She was very modest. Even if she had already prepared properly, she would not be arrogant and complacent. ”

She was nothing like ye Zao.

“A pot full of water would not make a sound, and half a pot of water would jingle! ”

“Up until now, Liu Caiyi still did not understand why master Yu would accept a good-for-nothing as his disciple. ”

It was simply a waste of resources.

“Liu Caiyi continued, “This year’s assessment competition has become more valuable. This is some information that I have helped you organize. Take a good look at it. It might be of help to you.” ”

“After saying this, Liu Caiyi handed Feng Qianxian a stack of information. ”

The assessment of the literary world was different from other competitions.

“The assessment was not only about calligraphy, but there were also many literary topics. ”

“As the Vice President of the Chinese Arts Association, Liu Caiyi had a lot of connections. She could more or less know about the assessment questions. ”

“”Sister Caiyi, thank you.”Feng Xianxian took the information and thanked her. ”

“Of course.”Liu Caiyi smiled.

“At this moment, there was a knock on the door again. ”

Feng Xianxian walked over to open the door.

“This time, it was Old Lady Lin and sister-in-law Wang. ”

“”Grandma, Why are you here?”Feng Xianxian asked in surprise. ”

“Old Lady Lin smiled and said, “I came to see you.” ”

“Please come in.”

Feng Xianxian helped Old Lady Lin into the house.

“Seeing Old Lady Lin come in, Liu Caiyi smiled and stood up. “Old Lady Lin.” ”

Old Lady Lin was stunned for a moment. She did not know Liu Caiyi.

“Feng Xianxian took the initiative to introduce her. “Grandma, this is Liu Caiyi, the vice president of the Chinese Arts Association.” ”

Old Lady Lin smiled at Liu Caiyi. “Miss Liu is really young and promising. She is already the vice president at such a young age.”

It was said that birds of a feather flock together. This saying was not wrong at all.

“Although Feng Xianxian was down and out now, the people who appeared by Feng Xianxian’s side were all very outstanding people. ”

Unlike ye Zhuo.

He was always hanging out with those shady people!

Could Ye Zhuo make friends with Liu Caiyi?

Definitely Not!

“Liu Caiyi said humbly, “Old Madam, you flatter me.” ”

Liu Caiyi had also heard about Feng Qianhua poisoning old madam Lin.
