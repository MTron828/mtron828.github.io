“Chen Siyan said, “I’m going to visit Shiyu later. He likes the ginger and Ginger Water I cook the most.”It was unknown when Song Shiyu had fallen in love with the combination of ginger and Ginger. ”

“Therefore, no matter when and where, as long as Chen Siyan was around, Chen Siyan would let song Shiyu drink the ginger water with brown sugar that she personally cooked. ” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“”OH.”Xia Wei nodded, but she felt very strange in her heart. Why would a grown man like to drink this kind of thing. ”

“Not long after returning to the room, the hotel staff brought the old brown sugar and ginger over. ”

“The hotel suite had a kitchen. After Chen Siyan washed the ginger, she cut it into strips of ginger and then boiled it into brown sugar ginger water. ”

“Soon, the kitchen was filled with a strong smell of brown sugar ginger. ”

“Chen Siyan hated ginger very much. In the past, no matter how much her stomach hurt, she would not drink a mouthful of brown sugar and ginger water. But ever since song Shiyu fell in love with this taste.., chen Siyan forced herself to like this taste. ”

“After boiling the brown sugar and ginger water for half an hour, Chen Siyan took out a thermos cup, filled it, and sent it to Song Shiyu’s suite. ”

“Standing at the door of Song Shiyu’s room, Xia Wei’s words rang in her ears, and Chen Siyan’s heart raced. ”

Bang! Bang! Bang!

“Chen Siyan took a deep breath and tried hard to calm herself down. Then, she reached out and pressed the doorbell. ”

“The next second, the door was opened from the inside. ”

It was song Shiyu who opened the door.

“Seeing Chen Siyan outside, song Shiyu frowned slightly. “When did you come?” ”

“”I arrived on the 27th.”Chen Siyan walked inside. “I saw your assistant, Liu Kai, Downstairs. He said that you live here too, so I boiled some brown sugar and ginger water to see you.” ”

“After saying that, Chen Siyan poured out the brown sugar and ginger water from the Thermos Cup and handed it to Song Shiyu. “Try it. It’s still the same taste.” ”

Song Shiyu took the brown sugar ginger water and took a sip.

“Chen Siyan couldn’t wait to ask, “How is it?” ”

“It’s okay.”Song Shiyu nodded.

“It’s good that you like it.”Chen Siyan smiled.

“After drinking the brown sugar ginger water in the bowl, song Shiyu poured out the entire thermos cup. ”

“Seeing that song Shiyu liked the brown sugar ginger water so much, Chen Siyan’s heart was instantly filled. ”

It was very fulfilling and very blissful.

“Seeing that song Shiyu’s room was a little messy, Chen Siyan began to clean up. ”

“Seeing that Chen Siyan had actually cleaned up the room, song Shiyu placed the empty bowl on the table and continued, “You don’t have to clean up those things. Someone will come over to clean them up.” ”

“”It’s fine. I have nothing to do anyway,”chen Siyan said. ”

“Song Shiyu looked at Chen Siyan with a strange expression in his eyes. Chen Siyan had grown up with him from a young age and was a very kind girl. However, she couldn’t force herself when it came to matters of the heart. “Siyan.” ”

“Oh?”Chen Siyan raised her head and looked at song Shiyu. “What’s Wrong?”

“Song Shiyu looked at Chen Siyan just like that, “I’m a person without a heart. I Won’t fall in love with anyone in my life. No matter how much you’ve done for me, I won’t be moved. “If it weren’t for Old Master Chen, you wouldn’t even be qualified to serve me tea and water! “Don’t waste a girl’s best years on me. It’s not worth it!” ”

These words were a little harsh.

“But if they weren’t harsh, Chen Siyan would never wake up. ”

Old Master Chen had once done him a favor. Chen Siyan was old master Chen’s only granddaughter. Song Shiyu didn’t want to see Chen Siyan trapped here with him.

“Hearing that, Chen Siyan’s eyes turned red, but she still tried hard to control her tears. ”

She could not cry.

She could not cry!

“”It’s my business that I like you. You have no right to interfere with my liking.”Chen siyan continued, “I don’t need you to respond to my liking. I only hope that we can be the same as before! “Shiyu, I’m not the kind of person who pesters you. I’m willing to do all these things now!” ”

She only wanted to talk to Song Shiyu and cook him a bowl of brown sugar ginger water.

Song Shiyu didn’t say anything else. He walked out of the balcony and lit a cigarette. The smoke blurred his face.

“The weather in C Nation was good and it was very suitable for sunbathing. After smoking a cigarette, Song Shiyu sat on the chair, took out his phone, and started to study mobile games. ”

“Chen Siyan looked at song Shiyu outside the balcony, and she could not tell what she felt. ”

It was only for a moment.

She suddenly felt that they seemed to have returned to the way they used to be.

A bitter smile appeared on the corner of Chen Siyan’s mouth.
