“”Then what do we do now?”Wen Yang frowned. “We can’t Just Watch Man Wen go to jail, can we?” ”

“At this point, Wen Yang seemed to have suddenly thought of something. His eyes lit up and he continued, “Let’s go find Miss Ye?” ”

“When he heard the words ‘Miss Ye’, Fan Mu’s eyes lit up as well. “That’s not a bad idea.” ”

Half of the reason why man Wen could become the president was due to Ye Zao.

“If it were not for ye Zao’s assistance, Man Wen might not have been able to sit in that position smoothly. ”

“Moreover, Ye Zao was man Wen’s elder sister. ”

Ye Zao was different from man Xing.

There was no blood in man Xing’s eyes.

“Wait here.”Fan Mu stood up. “I’ll go find Miss Ye.”

“I’ll go with you.”Wen Yang also stood up.

Fan Mu turned around. “I’ll go alone. You stay here and wait for the news.”

“”Alright then.”Wen Yang continued, “You go early and come back early.” ”

“En.”Fan Mu nodded.

“After packing up, fan mu set off to the main alliance country. ”

Ye Zhuo was currently living in the main alliance country. It was not easy to meet him.

Fan Mu had also spent a lot of effort to meet ye Zao.

It was very different from what he had seen in the video before.

“The Ye Zao in reality had a more imposing aura, and his facial features were more exquisite. ”

“In the past, he had only felt that Manxing was worthy of the title of beauty in Manxing. ”

“But now, he only wanted to say one thing. ”

“After meeting ye Zao, there was no longer any beauty. ”

“Why are you looking for me?”

Ye Zao’s voice pulled fan mu back to reality.

“Fan Mu immediately reacted and continued, “Miss Ye, I’m a good friend of Man Wen. My name is Fan Mu. I’m here to tell you that man Wen is in trouble. Please save him!” ”

“Why should I save him?”Ye Zao asked back.

Fan Mu was stunned.

This was not quite what he had imagined.

“He had thought that after he found ye Zao, Ye Zao would definitely nod in agreement. ”

But Ye Zao actually asked why?

Could it be that he had misunderstood before?

Ye Zao was not man Wen’s sister at all!

It had nothing to do with ye Zao That Man Wen could sit on the presidency?

“After a moment, fan mu looked up at ye Zao and continued, “Miss Ye, based on my understanding of Man Wen, he would never do such a heartless thing! Now, only you can help him!” ”

“”Whether man Wen lives or dies has nothing to do with me. I don’t know what gave you the illusion that I would help man Wen.”Ye Zao’s expression looked a little cold, “I Hate Man Wen to the bone. Man Wen can only blame himself for being stupid for being arrested!” ”

“Miss Ye!”Fan Mu looked at Ye Zao in disbelief.

Man Wen treated ye Zao so well. How could ye Zao be so cold-blooded and heartless.

He was really blind to think that ye Zao was a good person.

“Now, it seemed that ye Zao was no different from man Xing. ”

They were birds of a feather!

“”Miss Ye,”fan mu said bitterly, “You, how can you be so cold-blooded and heartless! Man Wen, he...” ”

“”Men.”Before he could finish his sentence, he was directly interrupted by Ye Zao. “Get him out.” ”

“”Yes, Miss Ye.”A piece of tape was pasted on fan MU’s mouth. ”

Fan Mu was extremely angry.

He was really standing up for man Wen.

“Man Wen treated ye Zao so well, even pouring out his heart and lungs. ”

But what about ye Zao?

Ye Zao was actually so cold-blooded!

He was simply an ingrate.

“The daughters of the man family, every good thing! ”

Fan Mu was directly thrown out of the door by the guards of the headquarters.

...

On the other side.

The spies that man Xing had planted by ye Zao’s side quickly reported this situation to man Xing.

“Hearing this, man Xing’s lips curled slightly. ”

It seemed that her guess was right.

“To Ye Zao, Man Wen was a dispensable doll. ”

He could throw it away at any time.

“After knowing that ye Zao would no longer interfere in man Wen’s matters, man Xing felt much more at ease. ”

Ye Zao was ye Zao after all. It would be a lie to say that she did not have any fear in the past.

“But now, she did not need to have any scruples at all. ”

Wen Yang had been waiting for fan mu the entire time.

“Seeing that Fan Mu had returned, Wen Yang immediately went up to him. “How was it? What did Miss Ye Say?” ”

Fan Mu was so angry that she was red. “Don’t mention it! I’m Blind! To actually think that she’s a good person!”

“Seeing fan mu like this, Wen Yang frowned. “What’s going on?” ”

Fan Mu sighed and told Wen Yang the whole story.

“Hearing that, Wen Yang said incredulously, “How did things turn out like this? Why did miss ye turn hostile just like that?” ”
