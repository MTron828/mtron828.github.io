Chapter 1645: 345: a piece of trash. Tang Xue expelled from the base. 6

Translator: 549690339

Unwilling.

Tang Xue was truly unwilling.

What right did Tang Mi have?

What right did Tang Mi have to know all of this?

“Ah!”

Tang Xue suddenly lost control of her emotions. She screamed and was close to hysteria.

In the office.

Ye Zhuo was eating dessert as he walked out from the inner room. “What’s going on with Tang Xue’s grandfather?”

“CEN Shaoqing said, “Old Master Tang was one of the first elders to establish the CEN family base with me.” ”

“”I see.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and continued, “Does that mean Tang Mi is also Old Master Tang’s granddaughter?” ”

“”Yes.”However, old master Tang did not value Tang Mi when he was still alive. He did not even mention Tang Mi, causing Cen Shaoqing to forget that Old Master Tang still had a granddaughter in the Cen family base. ”

It wasn’t until this time that Tang Mi decided to board the aircraft carrier with Ye Zhuo.

Cen Shaoqing then remembered that elder Tang didn’t only have Tang Xue as his granddaughter.

“I want to tell you something.”Ye Zhuo finished his dessert and looked down at Cen Shaoqing.

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing put down the document in his hand. “I’m all ears.”

“”I want to develop interstellar tourism,”ye Zhuo continued. ”

“Hearing this, Cen Shaoqing was not surprised. “Where do you plan to go?” ”

“”Mars,”ye Zhuo said. ”

“Currently, other than China, no other country could land on the eight planets. Therefore, they had to seize the opportunity to develop interstellar tourism ahead of time, so that China could be at the forefront of the world. ”

“Once human civilization developed to level 2 and above, there would be no rush to come. ”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “I support you.”

“Mars mountain was currently a barren land without oxygen. It was mainly made up of carbon dioxide. Therefore, not only was there a sandstorm on Mars, but it was also extremely cold. It would take a long time to transform Mars. ”

“However, as long as it was something that ye Zhuo wanted to do, Cen Shaoqing would accompany her unconditionally. ”

He supported her.

“After eating a dessert, ye Zao went to the experimental cabin to analyze the samples that he brought back from Neptune with Dr. Millet and the others. ”

At the same time.

At the Lin family home.

“Seeing that ye Zao had finally returned successfully, Lin Jincheng dared to burst into tears. ”

This was a cry of joy.

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “It’s okay. Zao Zao is fine now. Why are you still crying?” ”

“”I didn’t dare to cry when you were crying just now. Now, you won’t Let me cry for a while?”Lin Jincheng sobbed. ”

“Other than crying when he met ye Shu and the others, Lin Jincheng had never cried so miserably before. ”

“If he had cried with Ye Shu at that time, Ye Shu’s emotions would definitely have collapsed. ”

“Therefore, Lin Jincheng couldn’t cry at that time. ”

He had been controlling himself.

“Ye Shu thought that Lin Jincheng was mentally strong and could bear all this, so he did not cry. She did not expect that Lin Jincheng was not mentally strong, nor did he not care about ye Zhuo. He just did not dare to cry. ”

“Thinking of this, Ye Shu’s eyes turned red again. ”

“”Dad, Mom, Don’t cry.”Lin Ze walked over with a fruit plate. “Eat some fruit first. I just called searing. Searing said that she will be home at about 11:30.” ”

“Because the aircraft carrier suddenly lost contact with the ground, Lin Jincheng and ye Shu were so nervous that they didn’t eat anything for the whole day. ”

“Ye Shu wasn’t hungry at first, but when she saw Lin Ze coming over with a fruit plate, she was instantly hungry. She picked up a watermelon and said, “This watermelon is so sweet! Jincheng, have a piece too!” ”

“Lin Jincheng took the watermelon from ye Shu and ate it. He couldn’t control his tears. Although the tears were salty, the watermelon was indeed sweet in his mouth. ”

It was very sweet.

Over here.

“After learning that ye Zao was fine, Ye Sen was extremely happy. He made phone calls everywhere to share his happiness with others. ”

Neptune was so far away from Earth. He thought that ye Zao was doomed this time!

Fortunately.

“Fortunately, Ye Zao was fine. ”

“Otherwise, ye Sen felt that he couldn’t live anymore! ”

“After making phone calls with his friends, ye Sen Dialed Ye Zao’s number again. However, on the other end of the phone, there was a notification that the other party’s phone was turned off. ”

Ye Sen frowned slightly. He immediately picked up the car keys and ran to the Lin family.

“When Ye Sen arrived, the Lin family was having dinner. ”

“”Sister, brother-in-law, you guys are eating!” ”

“Ye Shu smiled and looked up. “Have you eaten? If you haven’t eaten, let’s eat together.” ”

“Ye Sen looked around. “Where’s Zao Zao? Why don’t I see Zao Zao?”Eating was small, but seeing ye Zao was a big deal! ”

“He said he’ll be home at 11:30. He’s still at the base!”Ye Shu said.

“Ye Sen continued, “Sis, did you talk to zhongruo? Why is my phone switched off when I called him?” ”

“”Ah Ze did.”Lin Jincheng smiled and answered, “Zhongruo is in the lab right now. It’s not convenient for him to answer the phone. Sit Down and eat first. He’ll be back in a while.” ”

“”Now that you mention it, I’m really hungry!”Ye Sen sat down and ate together. ”

11:30 pm.

Ye Zhuo arrived home on time.

“As soon as he stepped into the house with his left foot, there was a “Bang”sound in the air, and colorful ribbons drifted down from the sky. ”

“Big niece!”Ye Sen ran over and hugged ye Zhuo.

“Uncle!”

“Cen Shaoqing stood behind the two of them. When he saw the two of them hugging each other, he had the urge to separate the two of them. However, when he remembered that Ye Sen was ye Zhuo’s uncle, Cen Shaoqing stopped the thought in his mind. ”

“No matter who he offended, he could not offend his uncle. ”

There was a custom in the capital.

“When the groom came to the bride’s house to pick up the bride, his uncle was not present. If he did not speak, the groom was not allowed to pick up the bride. ”

Cen Shaoqing did not want to experience the feeling of being troubled by his uncle.

“Welcome back our family’s great hero!”Ye Sen said excitedly.

Only by hugging ye Zao like this could he truly feel that his niece was really back!

“”Thank you, Uncle.” ”

“Ye Shu sniffed. “Zao Zao, you’re finally back. You Don’t even know how anxious we were just now!” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and hugged ye Shu. He smiled and said, “Mom, didn’t I tell you guys when I left this morning? You Don’t have to worry at all. Your Daughter is so powerful, how could anything happen to her!” ”

“”Yes, yes, yes, you’re powerful!”Ye Shu lowered her voice and whispered a few words into ye Zao’s ear. ”

“Hearing this, Ye Zao said in surprise, “Really?” ”

“Ye Shu nodded. “That’s right. If you don’t believe me, you can ask Ah Ze.” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “It’s better not to ask. If dad finds out, he will lose face.” ”

Lin Jincheng saw that there was something wrong with the mother and daughter. “What are you two talking about?”

“”Nothing,”ye Shu said. ”

“Only then did ye Zhuo realize that Lin Ze wasn’t around. He asked, “Where’s My Brother?” ”

“At this moment, Lin Ze walked out from inside. “Zhuozhuo.” ”

“Brother.”Ye Zhuo walked over with a smile.

Lin Ze reached out and rubbed her head. “My sister is really amazing!”

“”Of course,”ye Zhuo said with a proud face. “Otherwise, why would she be your Lin Ze’s sister?” ”

Lin Ze was full of smiles.

The next day.

The first section of the major news apps was the news of the space mothership landing on Neptune. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“On the news page, there were also many precious pictures of the universe and pictures of Neptune. ”

“In an instant, the number of views reached hundreds of millions! ”

“Zhang Pandi did not pay attention to the situation of the aircraft carrier. In her opinion, the aircraft carrier could not be launched at all. ”

“Tomorrow was Sunday, so Zhang Pandi slept in the morning. ”

“At 10:30, Zhang Pandi got up to eat. ”

“While eating, Zhang Pandi turned on the television. ”

“When she turned on the television, Zhang Pandi was stunned. ”

The person on the television...

Was.

Yu Zifei?

How did Yu Zifei appear on the television?

“”Hello, I’m Yu Zifei.” ”

“The reporter smiled and asked, “May I ask how Mr. Yu made up his mind to go to Neptune with Miss Ye?” ”
