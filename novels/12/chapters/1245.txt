“Chapter 1246: 260: Zhao Xueyin’s face is disfigured, and the Zhao family is expelled from the financial world! 3”

Translator: 549690339

“”Right! Zhonghua, we will listen to you!” ”

“Ye Zhonghua’s eyebrows and eyes were still the same, and no expression could be seen on his face, “My solution is to remove the shares of the Zhao family, remove Zhao Xueyin’s position in the consortium, and investigate the negative impact that Zhao Xueyin has had on the consortium. And hold a press conference! This way, not only will I be able to stop the losses in time, but I’ll also be able to leave a good impression on the public.” ”

What did businessmen care about?

“Of course, it was all about profit. ”

“Although many of the shareholders had a deep relationship with Father Zhao, in the face of profit, these relationships were nothing. ”

“Hearing this, everyone nodded. “Sure! Zhuozhuo, we’ll do as you say!” ”

“Ye Zhuo’s gaze swept across the faces of the directors. “Since everyone has no objections, let’s sign this.” ”

Ali and Afra distributed the documents in their hands to the directors.

Everyone signed them one by one.

“Father Zhao, who was sitting in his office, suddenly had a bad premonition. ”

Could something have happened?

“At this moment, the office door was pushed open from outside. ”

It was ye Zhuo and the three board representatives.

“Seeing them, Father Zhao’s lips curled up. ”

“No matter how powerful ye Zhuo was, in front of him, he was just a young girl who hadn’t even grown hair yet. ”

“If he hadn’t gone to the meeting, Ye Zhuo would have come obediently! ”

“”Chief Ye.”Father Zhao stood up from his chair, a hypocritical smile on his face. ”

“”Elder Zhao.”Ye Zhuo threw a document on the table, “The three representatives of the board of directors and I have come to inform you that the shares of the Zhao family have been revoked. We will give you two hours to pack your things and leave the consortium immediately.” ”

Father Zhao’s face turned pale.

Revoke the shares?

“What right do you have to revoke the shares?”

“Ye Zhuo’s voice was shallow, “Only when you are in my position will you have the right to question my decision! The Zhao family now has nothing to do with the Shunxi Consortium! Of course, if you are not satisfied, you can choose to sue them!” ”

“After saying this, Ye Zhuo turned to look at the three directors behind him. “Let’s go.” ”

The three directors followed ye Zhuo’s footsteps.

Father Zhao looked at ye Zhuo’s back and was so angry that his face turned red!

“How dare she, this little girl, Ye Zhuo! ”

How dare she!

“Father Zhao had been in the Shunxi Financial Group for so many years, when had he ever been bullied like this! ”

“Moreover, the person who made him suffer was ye Zhuo! ”

“If Zhao Xueyin had the same means as ye Zhuo, she would not have been bullied so miserably by Ye Zhuo. ”

Could it be that this was the legendary bloodline suppression?

Their Zhao family would never be able to defeat the Ye Family?

It was the same for the previous generation!

Was it the same for this generation?

“Before this, Father Zhao had never believed in fate, but now, he had no choice but to believe in it! ”

This was fate.

PA —

Father Zhao picked up a vase and fiercely smashed it on the ground.

On the other side.

In Zhao Xueyin’s office.

“Just like Father Zhao, she received a letter of dismissal. ”

Dismissal.

She was actually fired by the Shunxi Consortium.

What right did ye Zhuo have to do this?

Zhao Xueyin tore up the dismissal letter and went to the door of ye Zhuo’s office as if she had gone mad. “Ye Zhuo! What right do you have to fire me? Isn’t it just a cat? So what if I killed it? You are using your official position to seek personal revenge!”

“Ye Zao! Come out!”

Creak —

The door was pushed open at this time. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“However, it was not ye Zao who came out, but Ali. ”

“At this time, two security guards walked out of the elevator. ”

“Ali looked at the security guard and said, “This Lady Zhao has lost her mind. Quickly take her away.” ”

“Okay.”The security guard nodded and carried Zhao Xueyin on his left and right.

“Let go of me! Let Go of me! My father is one of the three elders of the Shunxi Financial Group. You Can’t do this to me!”

“Zhao Xueyin struggled with all her might, but her strength could not match the strength of the two men at all. ”

“Allie’s voice came from the air again, “Ms. Zhao, you still don’t know, right? Chief Ye and the board of directors have already dissolved the Zhao family’s shares in the Shunxi Financial Group.” ”

What?

Dissolved the shares?

Didn’t that mean that the Shunxi financial group and the Zhao family would no longer have any relations in the future?

No!

That wouldn’t be the case.

Half of the board of directors were close friends with Father Zhao.

They wouldn’t agree to the dissolution of the shares!

What was going on?

What the hell was going on?

Zhao Xueyin’s face was pale and her blood was flowing backwards.

“Before she could react, she was brought into the elevator by the security guards. ”

Ding —

The elevator door was closed.

“After a few seconds, Zhao Xueyin was brought to the entrance of Shunxi Financial Group. ”

The people who were watching downstairs saw Zhao Xueyin and gathered around her angrily. “Zhao Xueyin! It’s that cat-torturing Zhao Xueyin!”
