“The young man continued, “It’s only two million. That was ten days ago. I’ve already spent it all!””

“Song Chenyu’s tone was a little cold, “You spent two million in ten days, and you went to gamble again?””

“”This is my business.”The young man said matter-of-factly, “It’s none of your business! Just one sentence, are you going to pay or Not!””

“I don’t have money now.”Song Chenyu looked at him and tried to suppress the anger in his heart.

“The young man said incredulously, “How can a big star like you not have money? Who would believe you if you tell others?””

“I really don’t have money.”

“The young man looked at song Chenyu and said, “You earn tens of millions of dollars for just one scene. Usually, there are many advertisements and endorsements. You Say You don’t have money. Song Chenyu, do I look like a Fool to you?””

“After saying that, the young man continued, “I’m talking to you nicely now. Do you really want me to fall out with you? Let Me Tell You, a barefooted person is not afraid of wearing shoes. If you really make a big deal out of this, I’ll see how you can survive in the entertainment industry!””

“Hearing that, song Chenyu sighed helplessly. “How much do you want?””

“Give me ten million first.”

“Ten million?”Song Chenyu could not help but raise his voice. “Zhou Rui! Do you think I’m a bank owner? I only have one million now. Do you want it or Not!”

“”1 million? Song Chenyu, you’re just sending away a beggar!””

“Song Chenyu continued, “I’ll transfer the money to your account in a while. I really don’t have 10 million. If you want to blow the matter up, Blow It Up! If you really blow the matter up, don’t even think about getting 100,000, let alone 1 million!””

“When she said the last sentence, a sinister light appeared in song Chenyu’s eyes.”

“To her, Zhou Rui was a demon.”

It was exactly what Zhou Rui had said.

A barefooted person was not afraid of wearing shoes.

“If she were an ordinary person, it would have been fine.”

“However, she was a star with dazzling starlight, and her every move was under the spotlight.”

Her life was not allowed to have a single stain.

“Even if there was, she would do her best to cover it up.”

“Zhou Rui took the opportunity to stop. He looked at song Chenyu and said, “Then let’s make it a million dollars. I’ll wait for the transfer of the money.””

Even a rabbit would bite when it was anxious.

Zhou Rui was also afraid that he would make song Chenyu anxious.

“When he heard this, song Chenyu heaved a sigh of relief.”

“When he returned to the hotel room, Cen Yuyan had already gotten out of bed. She looked at song Chenyu and asked curiously, “Chenyu, where did you go?””

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “I had something to do downstairs.””

“OH.”Cen Yuyan nodded. “I’ll go brush my teeth first.”

“Looking at Cen Yuyan’s back, song Chenyu seemed to have thought of something. A faint light flashed in his eyes. He picked up the phone at the side and sent a message.”

“[ at 9:30 pm, I’ll wait for you at the legendary restaurant. ]”

“After sending this message, song Chenyu walked to the bathroom as if nothing had happened and asked Cen Yuyan, “Yuyan, what are we eating tonight?””

“Cen Yuyan said, “I might have to go home for a while, so I’ll come back to see you tomorrow.””

“Okay.”Song Chenyu nodded.

“At 9:30 pm, Song Chenyu arrived at the legendary bar on time.”

“The person she was meeting was none other than Zhou Rui, the young hunk who had asked her for money in the basement of the hotel.”

It had always been Zhou Rui who took the initiative to look for Song Chenyu.

This was the first time that song Chenyu had taken the initiative to look for Zhou Rui. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Zhou Rui was very curious. “Why are you looking for me?”

Song Chenyu leaned over and sat opposite Zhou Rui. “Don’t you like money? I’m here to give you money.”

Give Money?

“When he heard this, Zhou Rui’s eyes lit up. “You’ve gathered ten million?””

Song Chenyu took out a photo and placed it opposite Zhou Rui.

Zhou Rui frowned. “What do you mean?”

“Song Chenyu continued, “Do you know the Cen Family?””

Zhou Rui shook his head.

“He had come from a small place. In the capital, other than knowing a bunch of scoundrels, he only knew song Chenyu. He did not know anything about the Cen family.”

“”If you have something to say, just say it. Don’t beat around the bush with me.””

“Song Chenyu tapped the table with his finger and continued, “The CEN family is the number one family in China. The person in the photo is CEN Fifth Master’s fourth sister, Cen Yuyan.””

“Zhou Rui did not know about the CEN family, but he knew about CEN fifth master.”

CEN fifth master’s great name shocked both the underworld and the white world.

“Song Chenyu continued, “If you can handle Cen Yuyan, you’ll be the Cen family’s son-in-law and CEN fifth master’s brother-in-law in the future. At that time, you’ll be above everyone else. Do you want anything?””

“Cen Yuyan had just been rejected by Lu Xiu, and it was time for her to be comforted.”

“Although Zhou Rui’s character was a bit rotten, her looks weren’t bad.”

“Instead of letting Zhou Rui pester her, it was better to think of a way to get it over with once and for all.”
