“Zhao Xueyin smiled, her tone still gentle. “Big Brother Si, aren’t you going to introduce me to Miss Ming?” ”

How would lawyer si introduce her to Ming Yao?

He would definitely introduce her to Ming Yao. She was the person he loved the most.

“When that time came, Ming Yao’s expression would definitely be very interesting. ”

Zhao Xueyin’s lips curled up.

“Si lui looked up at Zhao Xueyin. “I’m sorry, Miss, you might have mistaken me for someone else.” ”

“After he said that, he turned to look at Ming Yao. “How could I possibly know such a person?” ”

“The moment he said that, the surrounding people’s mocking voices became even louder. ”

“I knew it. Eldest Young Master Jin just came back from studying abroad. How could Zhao Xueyin know him!”

“How embarrassing!”

“Wasn’t Zhao Xueyin normal in the past? How did she become like this now?”

“She has really embarrassed the entire Zhao family!”

“”If I were her, I would just find a hole and hide in it.” ”

“...”

Hearing everyone’s mockery.

“Hearing this, Zhao Xueyin’s face turned pale and her lips trembled. ”

The lawyer actually said that he didn’t know her...

What is the lawyer doing?

Is he deliberately doing this for Ming Yao to see?

Yes.

It must be like this.

The lawyer wanted to make himself jealous.

“Thinking of this, the lawyer looked up at the lawyer and said coldly, “Lawyer! Take a good look at who I am! I will give you another chance now. If you still do this, don’t expect me to Forgive You!” ”

“Are you this lady’s Friend?”Si Lu turned to look at Wen si lan beside Zhao Xueyin.

Wen Si Lan nodded. “Yes.”

Si Lu pointed at his head. “Is there something wrong with your friend?”

Something Wrong with her brain?

“Seeing this scene, the crowd became even more exuberant. ”

“I was wondering why she suddenly became like this! So there’s something wrong with her brain!”

“Didn’t they say that Zhao Xueyin is a talented girl? Why did her brain suddenly go haywire?”

“It’s probably because she was thrown out by master five in public last time and was provoked.”

“She was provoked! No wonder she became like this!” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“I heard that she’s only twenty-seven years old. It’s such a pity that she’s so young!”

“”The heavens can still live with their sins, but they can’t live with their sins. There’s nothing to pity! I think she’s asking for it!” ”

“...”

Auditory hallucination.

It must be an auditory hallucination.

Zhao Xueyin tried her best to calm herself down.

It wouldn’t happen.

She was the lawyer’s most beloved person. The lawyer wouldn’t treat her like this.

“Wen Silan quickly grabbed the lawyer’s arm. “No, no, Mr. Jin, you’ve misunderstood! My Friend is in a normal state of mind. She must have mistaken me for someone else!” ”

“Wen Silan turned to look at Zhao Xueyin and said in a low voice, “Xueyin, let’s leave quickly.” ”

“If they continued to stay here, they would lose face! ”

“How could Zhao Xueyin be willing to leave? She looked at Si lui and continued to speak, “Big Brother Si, tell them! Tell them that I am the person you love the most! As long as you tell them now, I will forgive you! You only have one chance. You have to make good use of it! Otherwise, I will never forgive you in this lifetime!” ”

She refused to believe that the lawyer had no reaction even after saying so much.

The lawyer must be very anxious right now.

He must be thinking about how to apologize to her.

Zhao Xueyin continued:

“”I’m going to count down from three, three, two...” ”

“Just as Zhao Xueyin counted down to one, the lawyer said in a cold tone, “It seems that your friend’s illness isn’t light. She’s already suffering from hypochondria.” ”

“Laughter came from the crowd again. “She is indeed quite ill. Otherwise, she wouldn’t say such things.” ”

“Oh my God! I think she has really gone mad! A normal person wouldn’t do such a thing!”

“I vomited!”

“Did she think she was a fairy when she asked Young Master Jin to apologize to her?”

“It’s the first time I’ve seen such a narcissistic person!”

“I really don’t know how she said that!”

“I feel embarrassed for her.”

“”Forgive her. After all, she doesn’t have a good brain.” ”

“How Disgusting!”

“...”

“Wen Silan quickly apologized, “Mr. Jin, I’m sorry, I’m sorry! My friend really just mistook me for someone else. Please don’t take it to heart.” ”

“Ming Yao quickly said, “Since she’s sick, Hurry to the hospital. Don’t delay the best treatment time.” ”

Si lui turned to look at Ming Yao. “Let’s go over there.”

Ming Yao nodded and followed Si Lui’s footsteps.

Zhao Xueyin looked at the backs of the two of them and her entire body trembled.

That wouldn’t happen.

She was Si Lui’s most beloved person. How could si lui treat her like that!

“Why isn’t she leaving yet? Isn’t she embarrassed enough?”
