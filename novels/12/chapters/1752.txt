“Most importantly, although the little girl was young, she exuded a calmness that was not found in people of the same age. ”

She was like a person who had gone through thousands of trials and tribulations.

“If one had to describe her in four words, it would be — ”

Unparalleled in the world.

And it was not an exaggeration at all!

“”Miss Ye.”The old lady looked at Ye Zhuo and immediately said, “I am Feng Shu jing, also Feng Qi’s mother. Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to meet an old woman like me.” ”

“”You’re too kind, old lady.”Ye Zao looked at the old lady and smiled. “Please have a seat.” ”

“In this world, ye Zao had no resistance to two things. ”

One was a kind-looking old man.

The other was a delicious dessert.

“Ye Zao was an orphan in his previous life. When he was seven years old, he almost froze to death in the snow. ”

“An old lady picked her up and fed her with warm sugar water, bit by bit. ”

“The sweetness was not just in her taste buds, but in her heart. ”

She would never forget it for the rest of her life. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“From then on, Ye Zao ate the sweetness like his life depended on it. ”

What made ye Zao Regret was that his grandmother passed away too early. She could not let his grandmother live a happy old age.

“Ever since his grandmother passed away, ye Zao focused on studying traditional Chinese medicine. Later on, Ye Zao began to develop the time travel device, hoping to use the time travel device to make up for his regret. ”

“Unfortunately, in his previous life, an accident happened halfway through the experiment. ”

Feng Qi’s mother was different from Feng Qi.

“The old lady had a kind face, and it was obvious that she was a kind-hearted person. ”

“Unfortunately, she could not give birth to a good daughter. ”

“Otherwise, the old lady would definitely be able to live a happy old age. ”

“The old lady looked at Ye Zao, and for some reason, her eyes suddenly felt a little sore, she sobbed and said, “Miss Ye, I’m sorry. It’s my fault for not teaching my daughter well and causing you and the base to be humiliated. I apologize to you, and I don’t expect you to forgive me. I just want a peace of mind...” ”

“At the end of her sentence, the old lady bowed to the old lady. ”

“”Old Lady, please don’t do this! Feng Qi Is Feng Qi, and you are you. This has nothing to do with you.”Ye Zao helped the old lady up and continued, “The dead are dead, and the living are like this. Don’t mention this matter again.” ”

“The old lady looked at Ye Zao, her eyes red. ”

“She thought that ye Zao would be unusually angry at the mention of Feng Qi again and give her a hard time. After all, Feng Qi had betrayed the base. ”

And Cen Shaoqing was kind to Feng Qi.

What Feng Qi did was no different from returning kindness with enmity.

“When the old lady came, she was even prepared for ye Zao to give her a hard time. ”

“However, ye Zao did not give her a hard time, nor did he take the opportunity to criticize her. ”

Ye Zao was still smiling. It was Feng Qi’s fortune to have a leader like ye Zao.

“Most importantly, although ye Zao was young, he had a strong aura. One could tell that she was not someone who was easy to deal with. ”

The aircraft carrier was just the beginning.

“In the future, she would have even greater achievements. ”

Feng Qi betraying ye Zao was her loss!

“Seeing the old lady’s face full of tears, ye Zao immediately took out a tissue to wipe her face. “Old Lady, don’t be sad. If you have any difficulties in your life in the future, you can come and find me anytime.” ”

The old lady was immediately stunned.

She felt even more guilty.

“Although Feng Qi was Feng Qi, she was, after all, Feng Qi’s mother. ”

It was all because she had failed to teach her daughter well that Feng Qi had done such a thing.

She had let everyone down.

“”Miss Ye, thank you. You’re a good person and a good leader.”The old lady held ye Zao’s hand tightly. “It’s Feng Qi who doesn’t know how blessed he is.” ”

“”It’s everyone’s responsibility to care for the elderly.”Ye Zao smiled and said, “Oh right, I heard from Cen Hu that you have something important to look for me.” ”

“”Yes.”The old lady nodded and looked at ye Zao, then, she said, “I’m not afraid that you’ll laugh at me. Feng Qi’s daughter, my granddaughter, has also embarked on the same path as her mother. My life has been wasted. My daughter is not like my daughter, and my granddaughter is not like my granddaughter...” ”

“At the end of her sentence, the old lady let out a long sigh. ”

She had never thought that she would end up like this in her later years.

“If she had known this would happen, she would not have had to guard Feng Qi all those years ago. ”

“In the end, she became a joke. ”

“Seeing the old lady like this, Ye Zao felt a little sorry for her. The old lady was making her grandson happy, but the old lady was crying all day long. ”

“However, ye Zao was not surprised to hear that Feng Ying had also betrayed the base. After Feng Qi betrayed the base, Ye Zao had investigated Feng Qi and her daughter Feng Ying. ”
