“Chapter 1193: 256: the lawyer suddenly came to his senses! Face slapping, Grandpa Five’s vest dropped all over the floor! 2”

It was fine if he was stupid.

He still wouldn’t listen to good advice.

“For the sake of a Zhao Xueyin, he actually broke up with his friend of more than ten years. ”

“The lawyer clenched his fists tightly, his entire body was trembling. ”

“The lawyer tried his best to control his emotions, not letting himself cry out loud. ”

Five years.

Five whole years.

“As the lawyer, he stayed by Zhao Xueyin’s side for five whole years. ”

He did not expect such a result.

Was He Dreaming?

The lawyer closed his eyes.

“Behind him, Li Chaoyang’s voice continued to ring out. ”

“”Since you already know the truth of the lawyer, don’t you want to clarify it within the consortium?”Li Chaoyang continued, “If this rumor continues for a long time, it will definitely affect Miss Zhao’s reputation. It will make those who admire Miss Zhao not dare to take the initiative to pursue her.” ”

People who admire her?

Li Chaoyang was definitely referring to master five.

Master five was going to take the initiative to pursue her!

“Thinking of this, Zhao Xueyin’s heart beat rapidly. ”

“In the whole of China, who could make master five pursue her personally? ”

Forget about pursuing.

“Some women, even if they were to fall head over heels for Master Five, master five would not even spare her a glance. ”

“For example, Ye Zao. ”

So what if ye Zao was so good looking?

He had found a boyfriend who was an imposter.

“When she became fifth master’s wife and the mistress of the Bai family, how could ye Zao compare to her? ”

“”I’ve clarified it.”Zhao Xueyin suppressed the excitement in her heart and smiled bitterly, “To be honest, those who spread rumors in the company a few days ago were all fired by me. “However, rumors don’t disappear in a short period of time. “However, I believe that after a long time, these rumors will fall apart.” ”

Yes.

The lawyer also knew about this.

A group of assistants on the 58th floor had been fired by Zhao Xueyin a few days ago.

The lawyer thought that these assistants were fired because they gathered to chat while working.

It turned out that gathering to chat was not the real reason.

The lawyer took a deep breath.

“Li Chaoyang nodded. “Since Miss Zhao has seen through the lawyer’s true colors, I don’t think there’s a need for an employee like the lawyer to stay in Shunxi Financial Group. Miss Zhao, what do you think?” ”

“Hearing this, Zhao Xueyin furrowed her brows. ”

What did Li Chaoyang mean by this?

Did he want her to fire the lawyer?

Li Zhaoyang was the fifth master’s Special Assistant.

What he meant was definitely the fifth master’s intention.

He was jealous.

The fifth master must be jealous.

“Otherwise, he would not have asked her to fire the lawyer. ”

“Thinking of this, Zhao Xueyin was overwhelmed by the favor. ”

“She never dreamed that one day, the great fifth master would be jealous of her. ”

“Zhao Xueyin nodded, then, she said, “Special Assistant Li, to tell you the truth, I have been preparing for these things since a long time ago. It’s just that I haven’t found the right opportunity. When the time comes, I will immediately ask si lui to leave.” ”

“”I see.”Li Chaoyang nodded and continued, “Miss Zhao is a sensible person. There will definitely be great fortune in the future!” ”

Li Zhaoyang’s words were very obvious.

Great Fortune.

Her great fortune would definitely be to become the mistress of the Bai family.

“Now, it seemed that she was absolutely right to take the initiative to ask Li Zhaoyang out! ”

“If she had not asked Li Zhaoyang out in time, she would never have known that master five had such a deep misunderstanding of her. ”

And she would never have known that master five still wanted to take the initiative to pursue her.

“Zhao Xueyin suppressed the excitement in her heart and raised her cup. She tried her best to be calm and said, “Then I shall rely on special assistant Li’s kind words.” ”

Li Zhaoyang also raised his cup and clinked it with Zhao Xueyin’s. “Miss Zhao is too polite. I will have to rely on Miss Zhao to take care of me in the future.”

“”Thank you for your favor, Special Assistant Li.”Zhao Xueyin downed the tea in her cup in one gulp. ”

“After chatting for a while, Li Zhaoyang suggested leaving. ”

“Zhao Xueyin said, “Special Assistant Li, it’s about time now. Why don’t we have lunch together?” ”

“Li Zhaoyang smiled and said, “Miss Zhao is too polite. DK Consortium’s annual meeting is in a few days. I have been preparing for the annual meeting these few days. When I have time, I will definitely treat Miss Zhao to a meal.” ”

The annual meeting of DK Consortium?

Why would Li Zhaoyang bring up the annual meeting for no reason? Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Could it be that master five wanted to invite her to the annual meeting and announce her identity?

Yes.

That must be the case.

“Zhao Xueyin’s heart raced in an instant. “Since special assistant Li has something to do, I won’t keep you.” ”

The lawyer on this side could not hear anything clearly.
