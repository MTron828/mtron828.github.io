Cen Shaoqing followed Old Mrs. Cen’s footsteps.

“She didn’t know if it was an illusion, but old Mrs. Cen looked at Cen Shaoqing beside her. She felt that Cen Shaoqing seemed to have something on his mind during this trip. ”

“However, Cen Shaoqing didn’t want to talk about it, so old Mrs. Cen didn’t ask. ”

The two walked all the way to the dining room.

“Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “Go Wash your hands. Hurry up and eat.” ”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and walked to the bathroom.

“A moment later, Cen Shaoqing came out of the bathroom and sat in front of the dining table. “Where’s My Mother?” ”

“Today is your father’s birthday.”

“After so many years, when she mentioned her short-lived son again, old Mrs. Cen did not seem to have any special expression on her face. ”

Birthday?

Cen Shaoqing suddenly realized that today was Cen Haifeng’s birthday.

“Every year on this day, Zhou Xiang would accompany him in front of Cen Haifeng’s portrait. ”

He would not eat or drink.

“Thinking of this, Cen Shaoqing stood up from the table. “I’ll call her down to eat.” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen reached out and pressed Cen Shaoqing’s arm. “No need. Even if you call her, she won’t come.” ”

“”I’ll go and try,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

Old Mrs. Cen looked at Cen Shaoqing’s back and the confusion in her eyes became even more intense.

“What’s wrong with this brat? He feels weird.”

Cen Shaoqing came upstairs and knocked on the door.

“After a long time, there was no response from inside. ”

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Mom, I know you’re inside. Please open the door. I have something important to tell you.” ”

There was still no response from inside.

“A few seconds later, the door opened. Zhou Xiang looked at Cen Shaoqing. “What is it?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted slightly. “Mom, Let’s go downstairs and eat first. I’ll tell you after we finish eating.” ”

“”I don’t have an appetite right now.”Zhou Xiang’s face was pale and her expression was sorrowful. “If you have anything to say, just tell me directly.” ”

Zhou Xiang would always be like this on Cen Haifeng’s death anniversary and birthday.

“The next day, she would regain her usual vigor. ”

“”Mom, let’s eat first.” ”

“”If you don’t want to talk about it, then forget it,”Zhou Xiang said. ”

She really did not have the appetite to eat now.

“”Mom, this news is very important to you. It’s about my dad. Can you eat first?” ”

“Hearing this, Zhou Xiang grabbed Cen Shaoqing’s sleeve. “Could it be that the sunken ship was salvaged?” ”

“”You can go downstairs to eat first,”Cen Shaoqing said. ” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Zhou Xiang knew Cen Shaoqing’s character and nodded. “Okay, okay, okay! I’ll go downstairs and eat!” ”

“Seeing his mother like this, Cen Shaoqing’s heart was filled with sorrow. ”

“If his mother knew that Cen Haifeng already had a new lover, would she be able to bear it? ”

“Seeing Zhou Xiang go downstairs, old Mrs. Cen was very surprised. ”

“She had advised Zhou Xiang for so many years, but Zhou Xiang was not moved. This time, she did not know what method Cen Shaoqing used to persuade Zhou Xiang to come down. ”

“”Xiang Xiang has come down. Hurry up and eat,”old Mrs. Cen stood up and said. ”

“Okay.”Zhou Xiang nodded and sat down to eat.

“The Cen family was particular about food and silence. When they ate, other than the faint sound of chewing, there was no other sound. ”

“After eating, Zhou Xiang immediately put down her chopsticks and looked at Cen Shaoqing. “Shaoqing, I’m done eating. Hurry up and say it.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing raised his head and looked at Zhou Xiang. “Mom, Grandma, Let’s go to the living room to sit down and talk properly.” ”

“What are you talking about?”Old Mrs. Cen asked curiously.

“Zhou xiang continued, “It’s about Haifeng! Mom, Shaoqing said that he found out about Haifeng!” ”

“”Really?”Old Mrs. Cen turned to look at Cen Shaoqing, her eyes full of excitement. ”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Good! Good! Good!”Old Mrs. Cen’s eyes immediately turned red. “Let’s go to the living room! Let’s talk in the living room!”

The three of them came to the living room.

“Zhou Xiang could not wait to speak. “Shaoqing, hurry up and say it!” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen also looked at Cen Shaoqing with excitement, her eyes full of anticipation. ”

Her son had been gone for so many years.

She had not even seen a corpse...

“As a mother, she had never been able to feel at ease. ”

“”Grandma, Mom,”Cen Shaoqing continued, “Wait a little longer, eldest sister, second sister, and third sister are not back yet.” ”

“As soon as he said this, footsteps could be heard from outside. ”

“CEN Yueya said, “Shaoqing, why did you call us back in such a hurry to announce something important?” ”

“CEN yueying teased, “Could it be that you have something important to do with burning?” ”

“This is indeed a big matter!”

“Cen Shaoqing raised his eyes slightly and continued, “It’s about Dad.” ”

“Hearing that, the smiles on the faces of the three sisters instantly disappeared. ”

“Zhou Xiang continued, “Big Girl, second girl, and third girl, quickly sit down and listen to Shaoqing.” ”
