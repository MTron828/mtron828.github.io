Chapter 717: 159: continue slapping my face and Call Me Daddy in public! 6

Translator: 549690339

Anyone who knew how to play chess would never abandon the chariot to protect the soldiers.

Song Chenyu frowned slightly and could not help but doubt whether ye Zao really knew how to play chess.

“If ye Zao really knew how to play chess, would he have to be so terrible? ”

He probably had a false reputation in the live broadcast world.

As for why he won...

He was definitely cheating.

“Seeing this scene, old Mrs. Cen, who was standing by the side, also broke out in a sweat for ye Zao. ”

The current situation was very unfavorable for ye Zao.

“It was over, it was over! ”

“Ye Zao wouldn’t Really Call Song Chenyu Daddy, right? ”

“Old Mrs. Cen frowned and was extremely anxious. Looking at Cen Shaoqing again, he was actually calm and composed, not anxious at all. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen said somewhat unhappily, “Yezi is about to lose. Why aren’t you anxious at all? Are you still a biological boyfriend?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing lowered his eyes and looked at Old Mrs. Cen. There was not a trace of nervousness in his eyes. “Grandma, this is not the final step yet. You Don’t have to be so anxious.” ”

No one knew ye Zhuo’s chess moves better than Cen Shaoqing.

She was different from ordinary people to begin with.

“Do you mean that Ye Zi will win?”Old Mrs. Cen asked.

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Really?”Old Mrs. Cen could not believe it.

“Of course it’s true.”

“With Cen Shaoqing’s words, old Mrs. Cen heaved a sigh of relief. ”

The situation was getting more and more serious.

Ye Zhuo’s chess pieces were almost eaten up by song Chenyu.

There was only one car left to cross the river.

“Looking at song Chenyu’s side, there were still cannons and curses. ”

The other people at the side also felt that ye Zao was bound to lose this round.

“Especially Cen Yuyan, her smug expression was almost written all over her face. ”

She would soon hear ye Zao call her father.

How could she not be excited?

“I lost! I lost! Miss ye is definitely going to lose this round!”

“Didn’t they say that Miss Ye is a big chess player in the live broadcast industry? Why is her chess skills so bad?”

“Live broadcasts are always fake. That’s all marketing. Do you really believe it?”

“I didn’t expect Miss Song’s chess skills to be so good!”

“I heard that Miss Song’s grandfather is the President of the Chess Association!”

“So it’s a chess family! No wonder miss song is so powerful!”

“Listening to the discussions of the crowd, song Chenyu picked up another stone and reminded ye zhuo, “Miss Ye, I’m going to be a general.” ”

Ye Zao’s expression remained indifferent and unmoved. “Come.”

A mocking look flashed across song Chenyu’s eyes.

What time was it.

Ye Zao was still pretending to be calm.

He was really capable.

“Song Chenyu curled his lips into a smile and placed the stone. “General, Miss Ye, thank you for letting me win.” ”

The outcome was already decided!

Ye Zao was definitely going to call her father.

“Ye Zao raised his brows slightly. “Miss Song, take a closer look and see if you can become a general?” ”

Song Chenyu was stunned and lowered his head to look at the chessboard.

“The situation on the chessboard, which had already determined the outcome of the battle, was instantly reversed. ”

At this moment.

“Not only could she not become a general, but she had to face ye Zhuo’s pawn general instead, and she had nowhere to go. ”

What was going on?

Song Chenyu instantly broke out in cold sweat.

The smiles on Cen Yuyan and Zhou Xiaowan’s faces also stiffened at the corners of their mouths.

He lost!

Song Chenyu actually lost.

How could song Chenyu lose?

How could song Chenyu lose to ye Zao?

Ye Zao slowly moved the small soldier over and ate song Chenyu’s handsomeness.

“”Miss Song, you’re Too Kind.” ” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

That tone of voice was extremely calm.

“”Holy shit! He’s in the middle of the game! He fell into a trap!”Someone who knew chess by the side immediately saw through the trick and nearly said, “High! It’s really too high! Miss Ye’s move is simply unprecedented!” ”

“Miss Ye is too amazing!”

“I thought Miss Ye was going to lose just now!”

No one expected ye Zao to turn the tables and make a strong comeback.

The scene was heated up.

Old Mrs. Cen was so excited that she almost jumped out. “She won! She won! My Granddaughter-in-law won!”

Song Chenyu held the chess piece in her hand and did not come back to her senses for a long time.

She had played chess for more than twenty years and had never lost to anyone.

Today was the first time.

“Moreover, this person was ye Zhuo, whom she had never even looked at. ”

Ye Zhuo?

What right did ye Zhuo have?

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Oh right, that, fourth girl, you, your friends, and the three of you, shouldn’t you fulfill the bet?” ”

Bet?

What Bet?

“Of course, whoever lost would be called father to make a bet! ”

“Although Cen Yuyan was old Mrs. Cen’s biological granddaughter,. ”

Old Mrs. Cen had no intention of letting Cen Yuyan off.

“A person like Cen Yuyan, who was simple-minded, should be given some suffering to eat. ”

“Otherwise, she would never know the immensity of Heaven and earth! ”

“”Grandma,”Cen Yuyan looked at Old Mrs. Cen and said with some difficulty, “I was just joking just now, and you took it seriously?” ”

“”Joking? who was joking with you?”Old Mrs. Cen said with a straight face, “This is your bet with Yezi, and it can’t be brushed off with just a joke! Since it’s a competition, then you have to abide by the rules of the competition!” ”

Want to go back on your word?

No Way!

There wasn’t even a window!

“Grandma...”Cen Yuyan frowned slightly.

“After all, she was Cen Shaoqing’s fourth sister. She couldn’t really make her call ye Zhuo Daddy, right? ”

This was too ugly!

No Way!

It couldn’t be like this!

Cen Yuyan only wanted to beat herself to death just now.

She shouldn’t have agreed to this bet.

But it was useless to regret now.

“Cen Yuyan could only beg old madam cen, “Grandma... isn’t it just a game? Do you have to be so serious?” ”

“”Who said this is a game? This is a competition!”Old madam CEN continued, “Since you can’t afford to lose, then don’t agree to the competition! What’s the meaning of going back on your words now? Don’t think that you’re my granddaughter. You can fool me by saying a few good words in front of me! I’ll tell you! No Way!” ”

“Song Chenyu took a deep breath and clenched and loosened the fists hidden in his sleeves. He loosened and clenched his fists again and again and walked in front of ye Zao, “There’s always someone better than you. I’m completely convinced of my loss today. Calling Miss Ye ‘Daddy’makes me completely convinced!” ”

“At this moment, she could only follow the bet. ”

“If she acted a little more magnanimous, she could win the favor of everyone. ”

She couldn’t let everyone think that she couldn’t afford to lose.

“Seeing that song Chenyu was already like this, Cen Yuyan and Zhou Xiaowan could only follow behind and call him Daddy. ”

It was really embarrassing to die in front of so many people.

“Especially Cen Yuyan, the blush on her face spread to her ears, but ye Zao didn’t know how to help her out. ”

“As long as ye Zao was sensible, he wouldn’t deliberately make things difficult for her. ”

Wasn’t it just a bet?

Did Ye Zao have to be so serious?

“If this was song Chenyu, he definitely would not be like this. ”

Old Madam Cen only felt refreshed and extremely happy. She even took out her phone to record this happy scene.

“After the chess game ended, Cen Yuyan did not dare to play any more tricks. ”

“Song Chenyu raised his head to look at Cen Yuyan and Zhou Xiaowan. His face was full of guilt. “Yuyan Xiaowan, I’m sorry that you were implicated by me.” ”
