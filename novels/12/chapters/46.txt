Chapter 47: She Will Come Back and Beg Us

“What do you mean?” Ye Shu was stunned and at a loss for words.

Ye Shuang explained, “Mr. Li is 55 years old this year. Don’t judge him by his looks, but he is a multimillionaire. If you get together with him, you will enjoy endless glory and wealth in the future!”

That’s right, this was Ye Shuang’s idea.

Truth be told, it wasn’t that she liked Ye Shu that much. She came up with this idea because Lin Haifu wanted to take this opportunity to befriend Li Hongwei and convince him to be his investor.

Ye Shu might be in her thirties this year and had given birth, but she was still really good-looking. She had mottled brows and bright eyes.

Ye Shu frowned. “Big Sister, you mean…” She didn’t need to continue the sentence to make herself any clearer.

Ye Shuang nodded.

Ye Shu refused. “Big Sister! I know you mean well! But I have no intention of remarrying now.”

Ye Shuang smiled. “Little Shu, you’ve misunderstood. I have no intention of letting you remarry.”

This fourth sister of hers was thinking too highly of herself.

She thought that Li Hongwei would marry her.

How funny!

Did she really think that any Tom, Dick, or Harry could marry into a wealthy family?

“Big Sister, what do you mean by that?” Ye Shu asked in confusion.

Ye Shuang continued, “The thing is, Mr. Li’s hometown is in City A, and his wife and children are also there. Originally, Mr. Li also had a small family in the Yunjing Province, but half a month ago, that woman had a car accident and had her leg amputated, so Mr. Li broke up with her. So, Mr. Li plans to set up a small family in Yunjing again…”

It was not uncommon for rich people to have a mistress in different cities.

Therefore, Ye Shuang did not find it strange.

Moreover, her fourth sister had given birth before getting married. She was not a decent person. It seemed that she would make the perfect couple for Li Hongwei.

Hearing this, Ye Shu’s expression changed. She looked at Ye Shuang and said in disbelief, “Big Sister, you…you’re asking me to do something that could destroy other people’s families?”

“What do you mean destroy families? Your words are too serious!” Ye Shuang smiled and patted Ye Shu’s hand, “Little Shu, this is for your own good. If you follow Mr. Li, you won’t have to worry about food and clothing in the future. Just lie at home and count your money. Don’t worry, Mr. Li is a good person. He won’t mistreat you.”

Ye Shu took a step back. “No! That’s impossible! I would never do something like that!”

“Why not? Why not!” Before Ye Shuang could continue, Yao Cuifen stood up excitedly and pointed at Ye Shu, saying, “Thank your lucky stars that Mr. Li has taken a fancy to you! Who do you think you are! With your sordid reputation, you’re lucky to have someone take a fancy to you! And you’re still being picky! You’ve done more shameless things than this! What are you pretending for? Do you really think that you’re still some innocent young lady?”

Ye Shu looked up at Yao Cuifen, her eyes slightly red.

Ye Shuang patted Ye Shu’s shoulder. “Little Shu, Mom’s words are harsh, but it’s the truth. With your current situation, you’re indeed fortunate that Mr. Li likes you. Mr. Li is so rich. After you follow him, you’ll become a rich lady. I’m doing this for your own good…”

“That’s ridiculous!” Ye Shu directly interrupted Ye Shuang’s unfinished words. “Big Sister, don’t say anymore! I won’t agree to it!”

Be someone else’s mistress?

She couldn’t believe Ye Shuang would even consider such a thing and say it out aloud.

Ye Shuang frowned. She didn’t expect Ye Shu to be so ungrateful. To think that Li Hongwei didn’t despise her for being a broken woman, yet here she was, unwilling to follow Li Hongwei! Did she really think she was still a virgin?

Ye Shuang shot Ye Shu a look, “Little Shu! I told you about this good piece of information and even spoke well of you in front of Mr. Li because we are sisters. Otherwise, do you think such good fortune will fall on your head? Do you think everyone can enjoy this kind of fortune?”

She was pressuring Ye Shu to agree to it! She couldn’t understand why her little sister would pretend to be all innocent.

“In that case, you can give this opportunity to someone else! I can’t afford this kind of fortune!” Although Ye Shu was soft-hearted, she was not the kind of person who could be controlled by others. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Otherwise, she would not have chosen to move out from home alone with her child.

Ye Shu continued, “Big Sister, you are not only a woman, you are also someone else’s wife. If someone were to introduce a mistress to Big Brother-in-law outside, what would you do?”

Ye Shuang choked, and her expression became very ugly. This was completely different from what she had thought. She had introduced such a good man to Ye Shu, and she expected Ye Shu to be very grateful to her!

But Ye Shu was not in the least grateful to her!

How dare she even suggest that Lin Haifu would have a mistress!

How could Lin Haifu be that kind of person?

It was extremely ridiculous!

“Alright, you guys are sisters! There’s no need to make things sound so unpleasant and ruin the harmony.” Seizing a right timing, Ye Shuai stood up and said, “Little Shu, Big Sister is indeed doing this for your own good. Since Mr. Li’s conditions are acceptable, I think you should consider Mr. Li! You’re a single woman with a child. Have you ever thought about how you’re going to live in the future?”

Ye Shuai was a scholar. He had always been upright about matters. Ye Shu did not expect Ye Shuai would utter such things!

Actually, Ye Shuai did not want to get involved in this matter. However, Ye Shuang had promised his family a house as a thank-you gift if they managed to get Ye Shu to agree to become Li Hongwei’s mistress.

People would die for money and birds would die for food. Who did not like money?

Moreover, he was promised a house! One had to know that the price of a house in an ordinary district in Yunjing had already risen to 30,000 yuan per square meter.

Ye Shu raised her head to look at Ye Shuai, as if it was her first time meeting her second brother. “The poor have their way of living, and the rich have their way of living. Second Brother, I won’t trouble you to worry about our family’s matters!”

“Little Shu, will you really not regret it?” Ye Shuai asked.

“No.”

Ye Shuai continued, “I heard that the high school fees Ye Zhuo is currently studying at isn’t cheap. School is about to start soon. Do you have enough money to pay the tuition fees? There are also living expenses, school fees, rent, utilities… Don’t look at me, we won’t lend you any more money this year!”

According to tradition, every year when school started, Ye Shu would ask them for money.

Ye Shuai made himself very clear. This year, he would not offer her any financial assistance. If Ye Shu didn’t agree, Ye Zhuo would definitely be expelled from school and face a future of misery.

Ye Shu took a deep breath. “Second brother, don’t worry. In the future, even if we die of poverty or hunger, we won’t borrow any more money from you!”

After saying this, Ye Shu opened the door and walked out of the study.

“This b*stard is really going against the heavens! Her mother is still here! How dare she throw a tantrum!” Yao Cuifen was so angry that she threw the teapot on the table to the ground.

Ye Shuai smiled and touched Yao Cuifen’s shoulder. “Don’t worry, mother. This matter is already set in stone. No one will lend her money this year. She will come back and beg us.”
