Old Mrs. Cen looked into the distance. “I don’t expect to be 100 years old. My only wish is to be able to see my precious great-grandchild. Just one look and I’ll be satisfied.”

“Ye langhua smiled and said, “Definitely.” ”

“Okay.”Old Mrs. Cen nodded.

“In order to successfully see her great-grandchild, old Mrs. Cen worked very hard. ”

“She was not a person who liked sports, but for the sake of her great-grandson, she now woke up almost every morning and went to the gym for a run. She did not dare to eat recklessly. The food she ate every day was prepared by a dietitian. ”

“”I hope so,”old Mrs. Cen continued. ”

“The topic seemed to be too heavy. Ye langhua continued, “Let’s go play mahjong?” ”

“When Old Madam Cen heard this, her eyes immediately lit up. “Let’s go, Let’s Go!” ”

“Actually, sitting for too long was not good for the elderly, but today was a good day. ”

“On the other side, an Lizi came back after her defense and immediately rushed to ye Zao’s side. “Zao Zao!” ”

“Ye Zao looked back slightly and said with a smile, “How was your defense?” ”

“”You performed normally.”An Lizi held ye Zao’s arm and continued to ask, “Zao Zao, have you guys decided on the wedding day?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“An lizi immediately asked, “Which date?” ”

“”The sixth day of February,”ye Zao answered. ”

An Lizi calculated that there was still half a year left.

“”Congratulations!”An lizi smiled and said, “Fifth master must be very happy now. He can finally get the beauty back!” ”

“”He’s really quite smug now.”Of course, Cen Shaoqing was not the only one who was happy. It was a great thing to be able to have a successful relationship with the person he loved. Ye Zao continued to ask, “Lizi, what about you?” ”

“An Lizi was stunned for a moment. She pointed at herself and asked, “Me?”? ”

“”Yes.”Ye Zhuo said, “How are things with Buttface?” ”

“An Lizi felt a little embarrassed when she mentioned this. “He hasn’t mentioned it all this while. I’m just a girl. I Can’t ask too many questions, can I?” ”

“Actually, an Lizi was also a little anxious. ”

“However, girls should be more reserved and not ask too many questions. ”

“Dog Two did not take the initiative to bring it up. If she took the initiative to bring it up, it would be as if she could not get married. ”

Ye Zhuo chuckled. “That’s true. When are you guys planning to meet your parents?”

“”I haven’t decided yet,”an lizi continued, “We’ll talk about it then. There’s no rush.” ”

“After saying that, an Lizi said, “They say that love should go both ways, but I feel that dog two is a little slow to warm up. Moreover, he’s a little straight. Anyway, he’s different from master five. Master five won’t cause any trouble!” ”

“Ye Zao continued, “It seems that dog two isn’t aware enough. Wait, I’ll help you educate him.” ”

“An Lizi smiled and looked at Ye Zao. “Okay, okay. I’ve wanted to tell you about this for a long time, but I’m too embarrassed to tell you.” ”

“We’re all on the same side. What’s there to be embarrassed about?”Ye Zao said.

“An Lizi said, “Can’t he be a little shy?” ”

“”Okay, okay, okay.” ”

“An Lizi looked around and then asked, “Oh right, why don’t I see Pingting? Didn’t she say that she would come?” ”

“”She went to the bathroom,”ye Zao said. ”

“OH.”An Lizi nodded. “What about Yueyue? Is she here?”

“She’s here too. She’s playing mahjong over there.”

“An Lizi followed ye Zao’s line of sight and looked over. She then said, “Then I’ll go over and say hello.” ”

“Go ahead.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Li Yueyue had won three rounds in a row and was in a good mood. When she saw an Lizi coming over, she smiled and said, “Lizi is here!” ”

“Yes.”An Lizi nodded. “How’s Your Luck?”

“”It’s just so-so. I’ll treat you to supper tonight,”Li Yueyue said. ”

“Okay.”An Lizi found a chair and sat beside Li Yueyue. “I don’t know how to play mahjong yet. You can teach me while you’re at it.”

Li Yueyue crossed her legs like a grandpa. “No need to teach me. This thing is simple. Just watch it twice.”

“Li Yueyue said it was simple, but an Lizi watched it a few times but still couldn’t learn it. She said with a lack of interest, “I can’t learn it. I’m going to find Pingting.” ”

“Go.”

“Coincidentally, Zhao Pingting also came. ”

“The two of them chatted for a while, and Zhao Pingting mentioned the great-aunt of the Lin family. “Your great-aunt is really amazing! This is the first time I’ve seen such a young great-aunt!” ”

“Great-aunt?”An Lizi was stunned. “Are you talking about that little brat?”?

“Yes.”Zhao pingting nodded. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“An Lizi said, “Don’t judge her by her young age. She has a steady bearing as an elder. When she reprimands people, she is very well-behaved! She even dares to shout at my father!” ”
