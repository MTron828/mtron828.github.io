“It was a very faint voice, but it made a sound when it landed. ”

“Mike’s footsteps paused, and he turned around to look. ”

“He saw a slender figure walking over. She had a black cap on her head, and the long brim of the cap covered her eyes. She could only see a white jade-like chin, and she was wearing a hoodie of the same color, she had a pair of long and straight legs. ”

“Although her face could not be seen, her powerful aura could not be ignored. ”

This person seemed a little familiar.

The next second.

Two words appeared in Mike’s mind.

Ye Zao.

Although he had only met ye Zao once.

But that unique temperament could not be replicated by others.

Why would ye Zao appear here?

Could it be that ye Zao had tracked his location?

How was that possible!

How Old was ye Zao?

What did she know?

Ye Zao was just a pusher.

Someone else must have tracked his location.

“Mike looked up slightly. “Miss, May I know who you are?” ”

“Ye Zao walked over step by step. “Mike Williams, male, age 35. He’s from C Nation, ranked tenth in the Jianghu assassination order.” ”

“Mike narrowed his eyes, but his face was calm. “I don’t understand what you’re saying.” ”

“Standing beside ye Zao, Captain Li was also a little confused. ”

Mike was from C Nation. He could see Mike’s photo on the martial arts world warrant.

But the person in front of him was clearly from China.

How could he be Mike Williams?

“”Miss Ye, is there a mistake?”Captain Li walked to ye Zao’s side and said in a low voice. ”

“”Don’t worry,”ye Zao’s tone was indifferent. “There’s no mistake.” ”

“After saying that, Ye Zao raised his eyes to look at Mike. His gaze was sharp, as if it could see through everything, “Mike Williams is not only an international assassin, but also a big shot in disguise. He has thousands of faces. This image in front of him is just one of thousands of faces.” ”

Inexplicably.

“Mike was actually a little flustered, but there was still not a hint of panic on his face. ”

Cross-dressing.

How did ye Zao See through his cross-dressing?

Could it be...

That he had underestimated ye Zao?

No.

It was impossible.

How Old was ye Zao?

Eighteen years old?

Mike was a very powerful and talented person. He also became famous at the age of 20.

Ye Zao was also a woman.

“According to the investigation, the average IQ of a woman was lower than that of a man. ”

Ye Zao could not be so young and so powerful.

Mike took a deep breath.

“Hearing this, Captain Li immediately reached for the gun on his waist and gave the order to the police officers behind him. ”

The police officers standing at the side immediately surrounded Mike.

“Don’t move!”

Captain Li knew ye Zao very well.

“Ye Zao was not the kind of person who did not know her limits. If she was not completely confident, she would not have said this. ” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“”What cross-dressing big shot, what international assassin! Officer comrades, are you shooting a TV series? Why don’t I understand what you are saying?”Mike took out all the documents on his body, “I’m a law-abiding good citizen! This is my document!” ”

Captain Li took the document and looked at it carefully.

Name: Wang Hai.

Gender: Male.

Place of origin: Han.

“Date of birth: November 23,19XX. ”

Captain Li compared the photo of the person on the document and looked at Mike.

That’s right.

It was the same person.

“After a while, captain Li handed the document to Officer Yin beside him. “Check the authenticity.” ”

“Okay.”Officer Yin nodded.

“Mike continued, “Officer, I still have my work card here. Do you want to go and check it together?” ”

“Since Mike could make a fake ID card, he was not afraid of being checked. ”

“Soon, Officer Yin came back with the id card and shook his head. “There’s really no problem with the ID.” ”

No problem?

How could there be no problem?

Captain Li frowned.

There was no problem with the ID card now. This Wang Hai was a native of Beijing.

Could it be that ye Zao had made a mistake in his judgment.

Captain Li looked at ye Zao beside him.

“Ye Zao had no expression on his face, as if he was thinking about something. ”

“Mike walked over to the two of them and said arrogantly, “Excuse me, officers, may I leave now?” ”

Officer Yin handed the documents to Mike.

Mike took the documents and swaggered out.

A bunch of idiots!

They couldn’t even see the human skin mask on his face.

And Ye Zao.

He really thought that ye Zao was powerful!

It turned out that he had overestimated ye Zao.

“Hold on.”

“At this moment, a fair hand gently put on Mike’s shoulder. ”

“Anything else?”Mike looked back and saw a face as clear as a picture.

“Show me the bag.”Ye Zhuo continued.
