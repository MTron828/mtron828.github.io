Translator: 549690339

“XI weiyue smiled and said, “Mom, do you have to be so anxious?” ”

“Yes! Very much so!”Yang Jiao turned to look at Xi Weiyue. “That’s all money!”

It wasn’t just money.

There was also Shunxi Financial Group.

Who wouldn’t want to go into the golden room?

...

At the Lin residence.

Ye Zhuo was sitting in the study practicing calligraphy when a servant knocked on the door. “Miss.”

“What’s Wrong?”Ye Zhuo put down his brush and walked over to open the door.

“The servant continued, “Old Mrs. Cen is here.” ”

“I’ll be right down.”

Ye Zhuo went back to his room to change his clothes and walked downstairs.

“Before he reached the downstairs, he heard Old Mrs. Cen and Xiao Bai quarreling. ”

“I’m the best Grandma in the Universe!”

“”That’s nothing,”Xiao Bai said proudly. “I’m also the smartest robot in the Universe!” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen glanced at it from top to bottom, “So what if you’re Smart? You’re not just a floor sweeper!” ”

“”Not only do I know how to sweep the floor, I also know how to clean the windows, wash clothes, and cook. I know a lot!”Xiao Baibai was so angry that he put his hands on his hips. ”

“Knowing so much doesn’t change the fact that you’re a floor sweeper.”

“Speak! Why are you attacking the fuselage?”

“Fuselage attack? What the hell is that?”Old Mrs. Cen was stunned.

“”Idiot.”Xiao Baibai covered his mouth and snickered. “You don’t even know what fuselage attack means! Everyone, come and take a look. There’s a person here who’s so stupid!” ” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Old Mrs. Cen:”...”

She didn’t expect that she would be ridiculed by a robot in her lifetime.

“Grandma Cen.”

“At this moment, Ye Zhuo came down from the spiral staircase. ”

“”Ye!”Seeing ye Zhuo, the old lady cen immediately stood up from the sofa. “This robot is bullying me!” ”

“Xiao Baibai.”Ye Zhuo turned to look at Xiao Baibai.

“Xiao Baibai raised his hand. “To be honest, I did not bully this amiable old lady. It’s just that she is too stupid.” ”

“At this point, little white shook its head helplessly and whispered, “She doesn’t even know what the fuselage attack means. She’s really too silly!” ”

“Meow.”Brother Meow immediately echoed and jumped onto Little White’s shoulder.

“Silly cat still understands me.”

Brother Meow flipped his hand and gave little white a claw.

Little White:”...”

“Old Lady Cen laughed until her stomach hurt. “Ye, these two little things in your house are really too fun! But what exactly does that fuselage attack mean?” ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “It means the same thing as a personal attack.” ”

It was no exaggeration to say that little white had the strongest AI in the universe. It often created its own vocabulary.

“Old Mrs. Cen finally understood. “Oh, so that’s what it means.” ”

“Just then, Lin Ze walked in from outside with a cage in his hand. Just as he was about to speak to ye Zhuo, he saw old Mrs. Cen sitting on the sofa and immediately greeted her, “Grandma Cen.” ”

Old Mrs. Cen smiled at Lin Ze. “Ah Ze is back.”

“”Brother, what are you holding in Your Hand?”Ye Zao asked curiously. ”

“Guess.”Lin Ze placed the cage on the coffee table.

“Little Bird?”Ye Zao asked.

Lin Ze shook his head. “No.”

“Old Mrs. Cen said, “Could it be that he’s a match for the silly cat?” ”

The silly cat was the nickname little white gave to brother Meow.

“Originally, Little White was just a robot, but now, everyone was calling it silly cat. ”

“Not really.”

“Old Mrs. Cen was an impatient person. “Ah Ze, don’t keep us in suspense. Tell US quickly.” ”

“Lin Ze removed the cloth covering the cage, revealing a furry and chubby long-eared rabbit. ”

Old Mrs. Cen swallowed her saliva. “What a delicious little rabbit!”

Lin Ze looked at Old Mrs. Cen in surprise.

“”Oh no!”Old Mrs. Cen immediately changed her words. “It’s so cute! What a cute rabbit! Look at that fat calf. It has muscles...”with a bite, it would definitely be very chewy. ”

“As she spoke, old Mrs. Cen’s eyes almost lit up. She couldn’t help but think of the spicy rabbit head and rabbit meat hotpot. ”

Lin Ze:”...”

Ye Zhuo:”...”

“”Ah Ze, where did you get this rabbit?”Old Mrs. Cen turned to look at Lin Ze. ”

“Lin Ze immediately hugged the rabbit cage in his arms and said warily, “Grandma Cen, this is a pet rabbit. Don’t look at it as fat, but it’s actually fake fat. Killing it isn’t enough to fill the gaps between your teeth!” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “Don’t worry, I won’t eat a rabbit like you!” ”

“Hearing this, Lin ze heaved a sigh of relief. “This is my classmate’s. He’s going abroad for a few days, so he asked me to help take care of his pet rabbit.” ”
