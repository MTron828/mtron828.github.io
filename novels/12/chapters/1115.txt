“At this glance, Allie was stunned. ”

“Indeed, 18 and 11 years of reports were missing. ”

Ye Zhuo was too amazing.

“With just a few glances, he could tell that two years were missing. ”

“”President Ye, you’re really amazing!”Allie continued, “I’ll go to the finance department to look for 18 and 11 years of reports.” ”

“Les looked at Ye Zhuo. “President, can I go with sister Allie?” ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

Les immediately followed Allie’s footsteps.

“Just as they walked out of the door, Les couldn’t help but say, “Sister Allie, did you see that just now? President ye is really amazing!” ”

Allie nodded. “He is indeed amazing.”

Twenty minutes later.

Allie and Les brought the reports to ye Zhuo’s office.

“In just thirty minutes, half of the reports had already been put back into the basket. ”

Allie and Lai Si looked at each other and saw the confusion in each other’s eyes.

“It had only been thirty minutes, and Ye Zhuo had already finished reading so many reports? ”

Even a senior accountant wouldn’t be able to do this!

Ye Zhuo was exaggerating too much.

“Allie placed the reports on the desk and continued, “Miss Ye, if there’s nothing else, we’ll be leaving first.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

Allie and Lai Si returned to the secretary’s office.

Not long after.

Allie appeared in Zhao Xueyin’s office. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Zhao xueyin smiled and said, “Allie, I heard that President Ye has been looking for the financial statements of our consortium for the past ten years?” ”

“Yes.”Allie nodded.

“Zhao Xueyin continued, “Did she say anything after she read it?” ”

Ally shook her head. “No.”

Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes.

“Ally continued, “I think President Ye was just putting on an act.” ”

Zhao Xueyin raised her eyebrows. “What do you mean?”

“Ally said, “A whole decade of financial statements, and Miss Ye actually finished reading them in less than an hour.” ”

She had searched for nearly an hour for these statements.

But ye Zao actually finished reading them in an hour.

This was too heaven-defying!

Unless she just wanted to go through the motions.

“Zhao Xueyin nodded and had a plan in her heart. “Okay, I got it.” ”

“”Miss Zhao, if there’s nothing else, I’ll take my leave first,”Allie said. ”

“Go.”

Allie turned around and left.

“Zhao Xueyin seemed to have thought of something and then said, “Wait!” ”

“Do you have any other orders?”Allie turned around in confusion.

“Zhao Xueyin smiled and walked over. She held Allie’s hand and gave her a shopping card, “Allie, I remember that you’ve been in our Shunxi Financial Group for three to four years. You’ve performed very well during this period of time. This is your reward.” ”

“Allie quickly declined, “Miss Zhao, I can’t accept this.” ”

“”Keep it.”Zhao Xue smiled and said, “Aili, your future will definitely be bright and bright.” ”

These words contained infinite meaning.

“”Then thank you, Miss Zhao.”Aili wasn’t a fool and naturally knew the meaning of these words. ”

“Looking at Aili’s back view as she left, Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes. ”

Want to fight with her?

Ye Zhuo...

He was still too young.

“Just as Allie left, the door to Zhao Xueyin’s office was pushed open again. ”

“This time, it was Zhao Xueyin’s personal wardrobe designer, Annie. ”

“Miss Zhao.”

Zhao Xueyin raised her head slightly. “Speak.”

“Annie said, “I’ve already matched your gown and jewelry for tonight’s banquet. Please take a look.” ”

Today was the 26th.

Zhao Xueyin was going to attend elder Zhang’s welcoming banquet for ye Zhuo tonight.

Zhao Xueyin definitely couldn’t lose to ye Zhuo in terms of dress and accessories.

“Let me have a look.”

Annie clapped her hands.

The two assistants immediately pushed a mannequin into the room.

Zhao Xueyin looked up. “I’ll take this one.”

Annie nodded. “Okay.”

...

On the other side.

In Ye Zhuo’s office.

“After looking through all the financial statements, Ye Zhuo began to summarize the questions. ”

Knock Knock Knock —

There was a knock on the door.

“Come in.”

The next second.

Pa..

The door was pushed open from the outside.

“”Surprise!”Little White descended from the sky with brother Meow. “Beautiful big burning, your most adorable little white has brought a silly cat!” ”

“Ye Zhuo was stunned and stood up from his chair. “Doggy, how did you get here?” ”

“Meow!”

Brother Meow jumped out of Little White’s pocket and jumped onto ye Zhuo’s body.

Ye Zhuo reached out and caught brother Meow.

“Little White ran over. “Big Scorch, I want to Hug You Too!” ”

Ye Zhuo reached out a hand and held Little White’s head. “You haven’t told me how you got here.”

“Little White said, “After they found your location, they came looking for you! It’s mainly because the silly cat said that it missed you. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have come!” ”

“You came here by yourself?”Ye Zao asked.

“”Of course!”Little White said proudly, “I’m so powerful now that I can even look at traffic lights!” ”

“Although the Shunxi Financial Group had a security system, under normal circumstances, outsiders wouldn’t be able to enter. ”

But who was little white?

This kind of security system couldn’t stop it at all.

“”Big Burning, when are you getting off work?”Little White asked. ”

Ye Zao looked at the clock on the wall. “Wait a little longer.”

“Little White continued, “Then I’ll wait for You! Silly Cat, come over! Don’t disturb big burning’s work.” ”

“Brother Meow crawled into Ye Zao’s arms, unwilling to go over. ”

“I have your favorite canned fish here!”

Hearing that.

Whoosh!

“Before ye Zao could react, brother Meow rushed into Whitey’s pocket. ”

“Seeing that brother Meow was eating so happily from the canned fish, ye Zao did not say anything more. ”

A cat only had one life.

“Since brother Meow liked it, then let it eat. ”

Ye Zao continued with the work that he had not finished. Whitey was waiting for her with brother Meow by the side.

“A human, a cat, and a robot. ”

The scene was surprisingly harmonious.

...

They got off work at night.

Ye Zhuo went back with Whitey.

Brother Meow sat obediently in Whitey’s pocket.

“Along the way, everyone turned to look at the prime minister. ”

“That cat is so cute!”

“Oh my God! That robot is so cute! I want to buy one too!”

“I wonder where President ye bought it from.”

“”I heard that President Ye is a professor in the science and Technology field. This robot should be her own work, right?” ”

“President Ye is too awesome.”

“...”

“Little White followed ye Zhuo out of the consortium. Just as they walked out of the door, little white said, “Do you hear that, great burning?” ”

“Hear what?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly.

Little White’s eyes sparkled. “Someone just praised me for being cute!”

Ye Zao:”...”

Not long after.

The car stopped in front of the top hotel in the financial center.

“Little White said in shock, “Da Zao, is this where you’re staying now? It’s so luxurious!” ”

“Ye Zao said, “No, I have a banquet to attend tonight.” ”

“OH.”Little White nodded.

“Ye Zao continued, “Follow me closely later. Don’t run around.” ”

“Got it.”Xiao Bai nodded and obediently followed behind ye Zao.

Ye Zao had just stepped into the hotel when a waiter came up to him. “May I ask if you are Miss Ye?”

“Yes.”

“The waiter continued, “Miss Ye, please follow me this way.” ”
