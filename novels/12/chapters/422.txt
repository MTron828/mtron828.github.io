“At this moment, Ye Zhuo was sitting opposite him and eating a steak. ”

Ye Zhuo was really speechless.

“Recently, CEN Shaoqing didn’t know what was wrong with him, but he always liked to disagree with her. ”

He even liked to give her food that she didn’t like to eat.

He took her to watch retarded movies that she didn’t like at all.

“If it were not for the fact that Cen Shaoqing had such a cute grandmother, ye Zao would have fallen out with him a long time ago. ”

“After a while, ye Zao put down his knife and fork and looked at Cen Shaoqing. “I say, have you been acting a little abnormal recently?” ”

Cen Shaoqing was stunned.

Could it be that ye Zao had seen through it?

“Since the arrow was already on the bow, he had no choice but to shoot it. ”

“Cen Shaoqing put down the Buddhist beads and looked up at Ye Zao. His thin lips parted slightly. “Ye Zao, do you know what White Moonlight Means?” ”

Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Of course I do.”

“”In the past, I didn’t know what white moonlight means, but now I seem to know.” ”

His gaze was very passionate and deep. Her figure was reflected in his eyes.

“For some reason, Big Brother Ye, who had never been afraid of anyone, was a little nervous at this moment. ”

But he was more curious and had a hint of inexplicable emotions.

“From what Cen Shaoqing said, he had someone he liked? ”

Who Was It?

What kind of girl could catch Cen Shaoqing’s Eye?

“Do you have a white moonlight in your heart?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and answered with certainty.

So there really was.

Ye Zhuo suddenly felt a little depressed.

“But aren’t you a monk?”

“I’m not a monk.”Cen Shaoqing stretched out his long arm and directly took the half-eaten steak in front of ye Zhuo’s table. He cut a small piece and put it into his mouth. Then he poured a glass of wine. “I eat meat and drink wine.”

Ye Zhuo was stunned.

“She didn’t expect that one day, Cen Shaoqing would break his vow for a girl. ”

“”So, who is your Bai Yueguang?”Ye Zhuo was too curious. ”

Who was that girl.

“Cen Shaoqing looked at her like this. After a long while, he said one word from his thin lips, “You.” ”

“Bang, Bang, Bang — ”

“After saying this word, Cen Shaoqing still looked calm on the surface, but in his heart, he was as flustered as a dog. It was as if his heart could jump out of his chest at any moment. ”

Everything around him seemed to have been pressed on the mute button.

Everything turned into nothingness.

“In front of him, there was only her left. ”

“At this moment, Ye Zhuo was also stunned. ”

What did Cen Shaoqing say just now?

Was this an illusion?

Yes!

It must be an illusion.

Ye Zhuo habitually brushed the black hair by his ear behind his ear. “What did you say just now?”

“Cen Shaoqing simply did not feel nervous anymore. He locked his gaze on ye Zhuo and said word by word, “I said that my white moonlight is you. Ye Zhuo, you didn’t hear wrongly. I’m confessing to you.” ”

Confessing.

It was not the first time ye Zhuo had been confessed to.

But it was the first time he was so nervous.

“Yes, very nervous. ”

His heart was in a mess.

“She did not expect Cen Shaoqing’s white moonlight to be her. She did not expect that Cen Shaoqing, the monk, would confess to her. ”

“The strange thing was that when she found out that Cen Shaoqing’s white moonlight was her, the inexplicable depression in her heart actually disappeared. ”

She thought that she probably did not hate Cen Shaoqing.

“In fact, she even had a good impression of him. ”

How should she respond to him?

“Cen Shaoqing continued, “Ye Zhuo, I don’t have any romantic experience, other than having a fictitious engagement with Mu Yourong. “After that, I’m a person who isn’t good at expressing myself, and I wouldn’t say any touching words of love. This is also the first time I’ve done something like confessing, and also the first time I like someone so much. “Before I met you, I was already prepared to become a monk.” ” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“In the past, CEN Shaoqing felt that life was very boring. ”

It was even more boring to marry and have children.

“But now, he really wanted to be with ye Zhuo and have many, many children that belonged to them. ”

“Seeing that ye Zhuo did not speak for a long time, Cen Shaoqing said, “Ye Zhuo, do you mind my age?” ”

Ye Zhuo tried his best to look as normal as possible.”... you do seem a little old.”

“If Cen Shaoqing did not say anything, Ye Zhuo would have even forgotten that this man in front of him was eleven years older than him. ”

It was said that there was a generation gap at three years old.

Eleven years old was almost three generations apart!

“Cen Shaoqing, who was overly nervous, was no longer nervous at this time, he said very calmly, “There are benefits to being older. Although I’m eleven years older than you, isn’t there a popular saying on the internet right now? Uncle has three good things. He loves his wife like his life, dotes on her like a treasure, and commands his wife like a mountain.” ”

“His voice was originally low and magnetic with a faint huskiness. At this moment, he deliberately lowered it, especially when accompanied by these words. It was so low that it couldn’t be any lower. ”
