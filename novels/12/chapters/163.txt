Chapter 164: 085: Lovely Old Mrs. Cen, my granddaughter-in-law is the most beautiful woman in the world! 8

Old Mrs. Cen Thought for a moment. “Yezi doesn’t have time this week. I’ll ask her out next week.”

At this moment, Cen Shaoqing walked in from outside the house. He took off his black coat and handed it to the servant beside him. “Mom, Grandma, what are you guys talking about? Why is there such a strong smell of gunpowder?”

“We’re talking about your wife again!”Old Mrs. Cen said angrily, “Your mom insists that your wife is not as beautiful as that table! We plan to invite her home next week and let you be the Judge!”

Just as Cen Shaoqing was about to refuse, old Mrs. Cen turned around and looked at him. “If you dare to refuse, do you believe that I’ll slap you to Death?”

“Grandma, I’ve already told you that I have no intention of starting a family. You’d better not make fun of the lady’s reputation in the future,”Cen Shaoqing said sternly.

Old Mrs. Cen looked at Cen Shaoqing and a malicious smile crept up the corner of her mouth.

Not getting married, right?

Fine!

She had to let this sand sculpture grandson of hers experience the feeling of being arrogant for a moment and chasing after his wife at the crematorium!

Otherwise, she wouldn’t even be his grandmother!

Being stared at by Old Lady Cen until his hair stood on end, Cen Shaoqing stood up from the sofa and said, “I’m going back to my room.”

Not long after, the sound of music playing ‘The Curse of Great Sorrow’came from upstairs.

...

......

The next day was Sunday. Ye Zhuo, an Lizi, and Zhao Pingting had made an appointment to watch a movie in the afternoon.

The three of them met at the agreed place.

Ye Zao said, “I’ve already bought the movie tickets. Let’s just get the tickets directly.”

An Lizi said, “Then I’ll go buy popcorn. By the way, what else do you guys want to eat?”

“I want an iced coke,”Zhao Pingting said.

Ye Zao Thought for a moment. “I want another set of potato chips, and then I want an iced coke too.”

An Lizi nodded and went to buy some snacks.

When she reached the bar counter, she saw a familiar figure.

It was her father, Anton Liang. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

It seemed like Anton Liang was waiting for someone.

An Lizi waited at the same spot. Not long after, she saw the familiar middle-aged woman.

It was that three.

Didn’t they agree to sever ties with her?

The scene in front of her pierced an Lizi’s heart deeply.

Ever since an Dongliang had changed, she did not dare to think about this matter anymore. She tried her best to imagine that an Dongliang was a good father and a good husband. They were still a happy family of three.

However, reality had dealt a heavy blow to her.

For so many years, she had never seen an Dongliang bring Xia Xiaoman to a movie, nor did she see an Dongliang give Xia Xiaoman a gift.

Xia Xiaoman had been silently giving.

She did not ask for anything in return.

But in the end, what did she get in return?

What she got in return was an Dongliang’s betrayal again!

“Dad!”An Lizi said directly.

When he heard a familiar voice in the movie theater, an Dongliang turned around and saw an Lizi’s disappointed face.

The middle-aged woman beside an Dongliang gave an lizi a friendly smile.

An Lizi clenched her fists tightly and resisted the urge to hit her.

“Wait for me here.”An dongliang whispered to the middle-aged woman and ran towards an Lizi.

“Lizi, why are you here?”

“The important thing is not that I’m here, but why are you with that B * Tch! Didn’t you say that you wanted to break off your relationship with her? If you do this, where did you put my mother? !”

An Dongliang’s expression turned cold. “What B * Tch! You’ve read all these years of books into a dog’s stomach!”After saying this, an Dongliang’s expression softened, “Lizi, you don’t understand the matters between us adults. That’s your Aunt Liang. She’s a very nice and kind woman. She doesn’t mind not having any status and just follows her father like this.”

“Hehe.”An Lizi sneered. “Very nice and kind? So she came to snatch other people’s husbands and destroy other people’s families?”

An dongliang continued, “Lizi, since ancient times, which man hasn’t been affectionate? Dad only made a mistake that all men in the world would make! Think about it in ancient times, there was still the system of polygamy! Regardless of whether I have a woman or not, your mother is my only wife. She loves me very much, and I love her too! However, this kind of love has long passed its expiration date. It has now turned into family love! My true love is with your Aunt Liang. Lizi, I hope you can fulfill Dad’s Wish!”

If she had not heard it with her own ears, an Lizi would never have believed that such shameless words came from an Dongliang’s mouth.

“What if I don’t agree to it?”

“Do you want me to Divorce Your Mother? Lizi, you are a good child. I believe that you will not allow me to divorce your mother, right?”Ever since an Lizi came to look for him last time.., an Dongliang knew that an Lizi had a father in her heart. She did not want her family to fall apart, so she did not dare to tell Xia Xiaoman this secret.

The reason why an Dongliang dared to say this was precisely because of this.

After saying this, an Dongliang patted an Lizi on the shoulder. “Alright, the movie is about to start. Daddy is going to watch the movie with Auntie Liang.”

After saying this, an Dongliang left.

An Lizi watched the two of them leave. She squatted on the ground and burst into tears.

Ye Zhuo and Zhao Pingting came over after getting their tickets. They were shocked to see an Lizi squatting on the ground and crying. “Lizi, what happened to you?”

An Lizi only cried.

The two of them decided not to watch the movie anymore. They helped an Lizi to a chair in the resting area and sat down.

“Lizi, what happened? Crying won’t solve the problem. Tell me. Pingting and I will help you think of a solution.”

Zhao pingting nodded. “Yes, although I’m not very smart, Zha Zha Zha is smart. She will definitely have a solution!”

An Lizi then looked up at the two of them. She cried as she said, “Zha Zha, Pingting, my dad, my dad doesn’t want me anymore...”

Zhao Pingting was busy wiping away an Lizi’s tears.

Ye Zha patted an Lizi on the shoulder. “Lizi, take your time.”

An Lizi couldn’t care less anymore. She told them everything that happened, “Actually, the thing I told you about my neighbor’s sister and Dad Last Time was my dad! My father had an affair! He said that he wanted to break off his relationship with that woman, but today, he was with that woman again! “He lied to me! “He lied to my mother!”

“Zhuoluo, Pingting, what should I do now?”

Ye Zhuoluo looked at an lizi and calmly said, “You must tell your mother about this! Then get a divorce and let the person who had an affair leave with nothing!”
