“After saying that, old Mrs. Cen still felt that it was not enough to vent her anger, so she raised her leg and kicked the sofa hard. ”

On the other side.

South Town.

“Bai Zhi stewed the buckwheat tea that she had made herself and came over. “Sear Sear, Shaoqing, the temperature in the south is high and the humidity is high. This buckwheat tea can reduce fire and dampness. Quick, try it.” ”

“”Thank you, aunt.”Ye Zhuo took the Teacup with both hands. Before he had even drunk it, he could already smell a pungent fragrance. ”

It smelled very good.

“Ye Zhuo took a sip. It was slightly bitter with a burnt fragrance. It was very refreshing. “Aunt, you’re really amazing! This buckwheat tea tastes even better than the ones I bought.” ”

“Bai Zhi smiled and said, “If you like it, you can take some back with you when you go back. There’s still a lot of it at home!” ”

“”Okay, thank you, aunt.” ”

“Bai Zhi was very happy. The children at home didn’t like the buckwheat tea that she had made, and only she and her husband liked it. She didn’t expect a third person to like it today. ”

“”You Child, why are you so polite to your own family!”Bai Zhi put down the teacup and continued, “Shaoqing, stay with Zao Zao. I’ll Cook with your uncle-in-law in the back.” ”

“Ye Zao stood up immediately. “Aunt-in-law, I’ll help you too.”He couldn’t let the two elders cook for them. ”

“”Sit down, sit down.”Baizhi pushed ye Zao back onto the stool, “Leave the work in the kitchen to me and your uncle-in-law. If you stand up, I won’t be happy! This child is being so polite to aunt-in-law and aunt-in-law. Aren’t you being so unreasonable?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing smiled and held ye Zao’s shoulder. “Don’t add to the mess. With you around, aunt-in-law and aunt-in-law won’t be in the mood to cook.”Cen Shaoqing knew these two elders too well, cen Shaoqing had previously hired a cook and a servant for the two elders, but he didn’t expect to be scolded by the two elders. ”

“You’re the one adding to the mess!”Ye Zao rolled his eyes at Cen Shaoqing.

Baizhi looked at Cen Shaoqing. “Stay with Cen Shaoqing!”

Cen Shaoqing nodded. “Got it.”

Baizhi and her wife went to the kitchen to cook.

“Cen Shaoqing looked at ye Zhuo and said, “Leader, do you want to go out for a walk? The meal will be ready in a while.” ”

“Sure.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“At this moment, little auntie walked in from outside. “Shaoqing! Shaoqing, come here for a moment!” ”

“Cen Shaoqing walked over. “Little Grandaunt, you were looking for me.” ”

“Little Grandaunt lowered her voice and said, “Shaoqing, your little grandaunt asked me to ask you, what does Zao like to eat? Is there anything that she doesn’t like to eat?” ”

“CEN Shaoqing said, “Well, there’s nothing that she doesn’t like to eat. She has a heavy taste and likes to eat spicy food.” ”

“Other than desserts, ye Zao simply did not like anything spicy. ”

“After thinking for a while, her great-aunt continued, “Can you eat coriander?” ”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded.

“”Alright, I got it. You guys go out and play. I’ll call you guys after dinner,”her great-aunt said. ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Then it’ll be hard on you and your great-aunt.”

“”This child, it’s just cooking. What’s there to be hard about?”Her great-aunt waved her hand and walked into the kitchen. ” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Cen Shaoqing came to Ye Zao’s side.

“Ye Zao asked curiously, “What did little auntie say to you?” ”

“She said a lot of bad things about you.”Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddha beads.

Ye Zao smiled faintly. “I can’t be bothered with you.”

“The two of them walked around the small town hand in hand. Until baizhi called to inform the two of them to go home for dinner, ye Zao still had some unfinished business. ”

The lunch was very sumptuous.

“On the table were spicy chicken, pickled fish, mapo tofu, white meat with garlic paste, spicy hot pot, blood curd, and a tomato and egg soup. ”

“It was obviously a very common dish, but it made people drool. “Little Auntie, Little Auntie, you guys are amazing! In such a short time, you managed to cook a table full of delicious dishes, and they are all my favorites!” ”

“”Then you have to eat more later,”Baizhi said. ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Don’t worry, I Won’t stand on ceremony with you.” ”

“Baizhi’s cooking was very good. Although the dishes on the table were all spicy, they each had their own taste. Ye Zao was full of praise, and Baizhi couldn’t stop smiling. She thought to herself, if only I had a caring little cotton-padded jacket like ye Zao. ”

Unfortunately...

“The children had grown up, and their wings had hardened. They had all flown far away. ”

“After dinner, Baizhi wanted to go to the foot of the mountain to bring some firewood back. The old couple disliked the gas stove’s cooking, so they always cooked with firewood. ”

Ye Zao and Cen Shaoqing also went over.

“Youngest aunt said, “Shaoqing drove here. We can just put the firewood in his car and let him bring it back.” ”

“Baizhi immediately nodded in agreement. “Yes, yes, yes.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing smiled and said, “Then I’ll drive the car over now.” ”

“Okay.”

“In a short while, the car drove over and Cen Shaoqing opened the trunk door. ”

Ye Zhuo helped to put the firewood in the trunk.

The trunk could not fit any more firewood.

“Baizhi said in disgust, “What kind of broken-down car is this? It’s even worse than Old Li’s tractor! It can’t even fit a single piece of firewood!” ”

“Little Auntie followed, “Little Zuo’s van is better than this! It can hold more than 100 kilograms of firewood!” ”

“Ye Zhuo laughed until his stomach hurt. “Yes, yes, yes, yes. Little Auntie, Little Auntie, you’re Right!” ”

“Cen Shaoqing:”...”this Lamborghini would never dream that one day, it would not even be comparable to a tractor or a van. ”

“After staying here for a day, Cen Shaoqing and ye Zao set off for the Zhao family home in the evening of the next day. ”

Ye Zao had promised Bai Shu that they would go for dinner.

“Before she left, Baizhi was very reluctant to part with ye Zao. “Zao Zao, remember to visit Little Auntie often in the future.” ”

Ye Zao nodded. “Definitely.”

Little Auntie kept stuffing things into Cen Shaoqing’s trunk. She said that Cen Shaoqing’s trunk was too small and asked Cen Shaoqing to drive a van over in the future.

Cen Shaoqing could only give an awkward but polite smile.

The old couple watched the car leave their sight before they turned around and walked back.

“Baizhi smiled and said, “My sister must be so happy that Shaoqing mentioned such a good girl!” ”

“After saying that, Baizhi’s expression became desolate again, “It was all my fault in the past. I shouldn’t have made things so awkward with my sister! “Old Man, why don’t we go to the capital to visit my sister instead of waiting for her to come over? “I’m her sister and she’s her sister. There’s no reason for her to come over to visit us!” ”

The youngest aunt nodded. “You’re right. Let’s pack up and go the day after tomorrow.”

“Okay.”Baizhi nodded.

It was exactly 7:30 p.m. when Cen Shaoqing and ye Zhuo arrived at the Zhao family’s house. It was the time for dinner.

Bai Shu asked the kitchen to prepare a large table of food.

“When the two of them arrived, they could start eating. ”

“There were many people in the Zhao family. Including relatives, there were more than 20 of them. Fortunately, the round table was big enough. Otherwise, it would not be able to sit down. ”

“Bai Shu sat at the head of the table. She looked at ye Zao and said, “Zao Zao, don’t stand on ceremony when you eat. It’s like you’re at home here.” ”

“”I know, Auntie.”Ye Zao nodded. ”

“After the meal, everyone gathered together to chat. ”

“At this moment, Zhao duoduo came over with an F language book in her arms. She said in distress, “Little Auntie, can you tell me about this problem? It’s too difficult!” ”

“Zhao duoduo was about to go to F country to further her studies. Unfortunately, she had never passed F language. ”

“Coincidentally, Zeng Qiuwen had the experience of studying in F country. ”

“Zeng Qiuwen was about to say something when Zeng rou smiled and said, “Duoduo, Zhuozhu is a top student at Beijing University! She knows ten languages. Ask her. She definitely knows more than my sister.” ”

Just wait.

Ye Zhuozhu was about to make a fool of himself.

“As Cen Wuye’s girlfriend, she actually did not even know French. ”

She wanted to see how ye Zhuozhu would end up.
