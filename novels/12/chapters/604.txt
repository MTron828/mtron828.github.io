“Feng Xianxian widened her eyes in disbelief. As a college student in the new era, she could not accept such a decadent feudal education. ”

“Feng Qianhua continued, “You have to be better than ye Zhuo!”The older generation preferred women who followed three or four virtues and married their husbands. ”

She had to make Feng Xianxian the daughter of a wealthy family who was both beautiful and intelligent.

Only in this way could feng Xianxian surpass ye Zhuo.

Only then could she successfully marry into the Cen family.

“”I heard that the old lady of the Cen family prefers girls who are sensible and obedient. If she knew that you went to female Durban, she would definitely like you even more.” ”

“Hearing this, Feng Xianxian nodded. “Okay.” ”

She worshipped fifth master Cen very much.

She also liked fifth master cen very much.

Feng Xianxian did not feel ashamed to make her worship a person like fifth master Cen.

“After all, other people wanted to work for fifth master Cen, but they did not have any connections! ”

“Feng Qianhua continued, “No matter how powerful ye Zao is, he only has a little reputation in the technology industry. If she leaves the technology industry, she will be nothing! Xianxian, the most important thing for you now is to surpass ye Zao in other fields! “Develop in an all-round way! “Completely crush that little B * Tch!” ”

“Feng Xianxian knew how to draw, finance, go, and design. ”

What About Ye Zao?

“Once ye Zao left the technology industry,. ”

What else could she do?

Know How to finance?

Know How to design?

Know How to draw?

“Compared to Feng Xianxian, Ye Zao was just a Tech Geek. ”

“Feng Xianxian nodded very seriously. “Mom, don’t worry, I will definitely surpass ye Zao!” ”

“The next day, Feng Qianhua came over with a thermos bucket to deliver soup to Old Lady Lin. ”

“Old Lady Lin did not see Feng Xianxian follow her over. She asked with concern, “Where’s Xianxian?” ”

Feng Qianhua poured a bowl of soup for Old Lady Lin. “I signed her up for a female Durban.”

Female Durban?

Old Lady Lin narrowed her eyes.

“Feng Xianxian was so obedient. If she was so obedient, was there a need for her to go to a female Durban? ” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Ye Zao had no respect for his elders and was so proud that he forgot himself. She should be the one who should go to a female Durban.

Right.

She should let ye Zao go to a female Durban.

“Otherwise, ye Zao would one day cause a big mess and embarrass the Lin family. ”

“”Qianhua, give me the number of the person in charge of the female Durban.” ”

“Feng Qianhua was stunned. “Aunt Lin, why do you want this?” ”

“Old Madam Lin said angrily, “I want to give that disrespectful girl one too! Let Her Go in and reform properly! Otherwise, she will go to heaven in the future!” ”

“Are you talking about burning?”Feng Qianhua pretended to be surprised.

“Yes.”Old Madam Lin nodded.

“Feng Qianhua said with some hesitation, “But according to burning’s character, she might not obediently go to female Durban, right?” ”

Ye Zao would go to female Durban?

Who knew what kind of trouble he would cause!

Feng Qianhua was looking forward to that scene.

“”If Xianxian can go, why can’t she go?” ”

Feng Qianhua took out a business card and handed it to Old Lady Lin. “This is the business card of the person in charge of female Durban. You can use this to contact him.”

“Okay.”Old Lady Lin took the business card and nodded.

“Feng Qianhua continued, “By the way, Aunt Lin, did you tell fourth brother about the matter of introducing a partner to fourth brother last time?” ”

“Apart from Old Madam Lin, no one else in the Lin family was speaking up for her. This kind of situation was really disadvantageous to her! ”

“Speaking of this matter, old Madam Lin was a little angry, but she still suppressed her anger and continued, “When are you going to invite the woman to Your House? Let me take a look.” ”

Feng Qianhua frowned. “What if you like her? It’s no use even if fourth brother doesn’t like her! Fourth Brother has to agree to this.”

“Old Mrs. Lin smiled and said, “Qingxuan and I are mother and son. I have the same taste as him. As long as it’s someone I like, he will definitely like her!” ”

It was said that mother and son were linked by heart. Old Mrs. Lin did not believe that Lin Qingxuan would reject her when the time came.

Old Madam Lin did not want Lin Qingxuan to bring those messy people back from the outside.

She had to personally choose her daughter-in-law.

“Feng Qianhua hesitated for a moment before saying, “Alright then.” ”

“After leaving the Lin family home, Feng Qianhua invited Jiang Suran out. ”

The two of them arranged to meet at a cafe.

“When she saw Feng Qianhua coming over, Jiang Suran stood up with a smile. “Qianhua is here.” ”

“Feng Qianhua said, “Suran, you’ve been waiting for a long time, haven’t you?” ”

“”No, I just arrived too.” ”

Feng Qianhua sat down and drank a glass of water. “I’ve already taken care of that matter. Are You Free Tomorrow?”

Jiang Suran’s eyes lit up. “Really?”

“Yes.”Feng Qianhua nodded.

“Jiang Suran grabbed Feng Qianhua’s hand and said gratefully, “Qianhua, if this matter is successful, then you’ll be my big benefactor!” ”

“Jiang Su ran was 38 years old this year. She was over 40 years old, and was one of the few older women left in the industry. ”

“Because she was too picky when she was young, she had never married. ”

Even though Lin Qingxuan was married twice.

But the Jiang family could not be compared to the Lin family.

The Lin family was an authentic wealthy family.

“If she could take this opportunity to marry into the Lin family, then she would be considered to have married well. ”

“As a girl, who wouldn’t want to marry well? ”

“Feng Qianhua patted Jiang Su ran’s hand. “Come with me to the Lin family tomorrow. The old lady of the Lin family likes obedient people. You know how to do that, right?” ”

“In order to marry well, Jiang Su ran stayed in Durban for more than a year. ”

No one knew how to please her future mother-in-law better than her.

“Jiang su ran nodded. “Don’t worry, I know what to do.” ”

“Feng Qianhua smiled. “Su ran, I believe in You! When you marry into the Lin family, you can’t Forget Our Agreement.” ”

“Jiang Su ran raised her glass to Feng Qianhua. “Qianhua, look at what you’re saying. I Can’t forget anyone but you.” ”
