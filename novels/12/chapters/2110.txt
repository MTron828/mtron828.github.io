Fiancée?

“As soon as these words were said, the air immediately fell silent. ”

Ye Zhuo turned to look at Cen Shaoqing.

Cen Shaoqing looked at Ye Han.

“Ye Han continued, “Actually, it’s not what you think. Mr. Cen, that fiancée doesn’t have a formal engagement with you. It’s just that the girls in their family have always been the wives of the Chief Alliance. “So, although you’re not really fiancées, you’re almost like fiancées.” ”

“When ye Han investigated this matter, he was also a little surprised. ”

“If Cen Shaoqing had a fiancée, then what was Ye Zhuo? ”

“Fortunately, this fiancée had nothing to do with Cen Shaoqing himself. ”

Those who did not know were innocent.

Ye Han was not the kind of unreasonable person.

“What exactly is going on?”Cen Shaoqing asked.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“The moment he opened his mouth, Ye Han felt an endless pressure. ”

“Cen Shaoqing was usually quite gentle. He did not expect that when this person frowned, he was actually so terrifying. ”

“Ye Han gulped, then he said, “It’s like this. There’s a big family with the surname Duanmu in the General Alliance. “Almost every daughter of the Duanmu family has married into the General Alliance of the General Alliance. “The current wife of the General Alliance is Duanmu Fengfei. Her niece is called Duanmu Fengyu. In other words, the person who is engaged to you is Duanmu Fengyu.” ”

“Duanmu…”Ye Zhuo narrowed her beautiful eyes. “No Wonder.”

“No wonder what?”Ye Han asked.

“”Nothing.”Ye Zhuo looked at ye Han and asked, “Is the Duanmu family close to the Wang Family?” ”

“”Yes.”Ye Han thought of the information he had found. “The daughter of the Wang family, Wang Meilin, is now Duanmu Fengyu’s assistant.” ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

This could explain why the Wang family’s core robot appeared in the Lin family.

It must have been arranged by Duanmu Fengyu.

“Ye Zi smiled slightly. “By the way, what does that Duanmu Fengyu look like? Is he good-looking?” ”

“”I don’t know if she’s good-looking or not, but I know that she’s definitely not as good-looking as you, Sister!”Ye Han said. ”

“It was not that ye Han was trying to flatter ye Zao, but her looks were there. It would be a little difficult for her to surpass ye Zao. ”

Ye Zao chuckled and patted ye Han’s head. “At least you know how to talk.”

“After saying that, Ye Zao looked at Cen Shaoqing and raised his eyebrows slightly. “Mr. Cen, what do you think?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing was stunned. “What do you mean, what do I think?” ”

“What do you think about your fiancée’s matter?”Ye Zhuo asked.

Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted slightly. “Whoever decides will marry her. You’re the only one in my life.”

“His very faint voice was loud and powerful, bursting with a powerful aura. ”

“Ye Han continued, “You’d better remember what you’re saying now. If I find out that you’ve betrayed my sister, I Won’t let you off!” ”

“Don’t worry.”Cen Shaoqing’s eyes were firm.

“No matter what, he would never betray ye Zhuo. ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “But what if uncle insists on you marrying him? He’s your father after all.” ”

“”I don’t have a father like that,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“”You’ve done well.”Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “I hope you’re not a talker.” ”

“I’m the kind of person who’s a talker?”Cen Shaoqing asked back.

Ye Zhuo looked at him with a smile. “What if you change your mind?”

Cen Shaoqing looked serious. “I will only change my mind when I see you.”

“”I don’t think you dare.”After saying that, Ye Zhuo turned to look at ye Han and continued, “Have you found any other information?” ”

“”There is one more, but I don’t know if this information is important to you,”ye Han said. ”

Ye Zhuo narrowed her beautiful eyes. “Tell me about it.”

“”Mr. President had an argument with Duanmu Huang Fei. I don’t know where he went, but he hasn’t returned yet.” ”

“An Argument?”Ye Zhuo frowned slightly.

“”Yes.”Ye Han nodded, then, he said, “Actually, I also think it’s quite strange. According to the data, the two of them are very loving. This argument came out of nowhere. Moreover, Mrs. Duanmu has been going out of the president’s mansion frequently these few days. It seems that she’s discussing something.” ”

“Can you find out where he went?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“Ye Han shook his head. “I’ve asked someone to check, but they haven’t found anything.” ”

“Where’s the Tracker?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“”I’ll go get it for you,”ye Han said. ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Okay.”

Ye Han turned around to get the tracker.

“Ye Han will be here in a while. I’ll bring you to my former residence for a walk.”Ye Zhuo turned to look at Cen Shaoqing.

“”Yes.”Cen Shaoqing slightly nodded, followed ye Zhuo’s footsteps. ”
