She was most afraid that Xie Wanqiu would not listen.

“When the others in the ward heard this, they all praised Zheng Wanyin for being a sensible and good child. ”

“At the very least, she could persuade Xie wanqiu to endure it. ”

Unlike some juniors who only knew how to fan the flames and cause trouble at home.

“Hearing this.., xie wanqiu said with a face full of pride, “This granddaughter of mine follows me and has a good personality. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have been bullied by my stepdaughter like this! Sigh, there’s nothing I can do. I’m a soft-hearted person. No matter how others treat me, I can’t be ruthless!”At the end of her sentence.., xie wanqiu sighed. ”

“There wasn’t the slightest trace of acting on her face. If people who didn’t know about this saw it, they would really think that Xie Wanqiu was a good stepmother and a good elder! ”

“Before entering the ward, Zhou Xiang heard the voices inside. She frowned without leaving a trace. Then, she pushed the door open and entered. “Mom.” ”

“Seeing Zhou Xiang enter, everyone immediately turned their heads and looked at Zhou Xiang. Their eyes were filled with the expression of a malicious stepdaughter. ”

Zhou Xiang was not a fool.

She could naturally understand the expressions in everyone’s eyes.

“However, the relationship between the stepmother and stepdaughter was always delicate. ”

“The more she explained, the more confusing it became. ”

“Zhou Xiang did not want to care about these things, nor did she care about the looks of others. ”

“”Xiang Xiang.”In order to create the image of a good stepmother, Xie wanqiu greeted her with a smile. ”

“Zhou Xiang continued, “Mom, I just went to ask the Doctor. He said that you can be discharged in the afternoon.” ”

Discharged in the afternoon?

Xie wanqiu narrowed her eyes.

Zhou Xiang was really vicious. She was afraid that others would know that she was angered by Zhou Xiang and was sent to the hospital. That was why she was in such a hurry to discharge her!

But was she that easy to get rid of?

“Zhou Xiang did not want others to know, right? ”

Then she had to make it known to everyone!

“Xie wanqiu pinched her temples. “But my head still hurts! Xiang Xiang, don’t worry. I have money. I Won’t let you pay a single cent to be hospitalized.” ”

“When she said this, the other people in the ward immediately gave Zhou Xiang a strange look. ”

This stepdaughter was too much!

She didn’t even want to pay for the old man’s hospitalization.

“Looking at the way she was dressed, there were five people and six people. Who would have thought that she was such a person! ”

It was simply disgusting.

“Zhou xiang hurriedly explained, “Mom, I didn’t mean that. Since you feel that your head isn’t feeling well, then you should continue to stay in the hospital! Why Don’t I Get You a VIP room?” ”

“You don’t have to spend that money. It’s fine as long as I stay here.”

“Zhou xiang continued, “Then I’ll go and handle the hospitalization procedures for you.” ”

Xie wanqiu nodded.

“Zheng Wanyin stood up and said, “Second aunt, I’ll go with you.” ”

“Okay.”

The two of them walked to the first floor together.

“Zhou Xiang had just left when the young man who was staying in the bed next to Xie wanqiu said, “Old Lady, that was your stepdaughter just now, right?” ”

“”Yes, it was her.” ”

“I don’t think she’s the kind of person who is sarcastic and mean!”

“I don’t think so either.”Someone immediately echoed.

“Xie wanqiu wiped away her tears. “She’s pretending! She’s acting like she’s even closer to people than my own daughter. After that, her face changed!” ”

“Seeing that Xie Wanqiu was crying so sadly, the people who were initially skeptical immediately believed her. ”

“If Zhou Xiang was really fine, why was Xie Wanqiu crying so sadly? ”

Sigh!

This old man was really too pitiful.

“After crying, Xie Wanqiu went to the bathroom. She closed the bathroom door and made a call. ”

“When the call was connected, Xie wanqiu wailed loudly. “Old Zhou...” ”

On the other side.

Zhou Xiang and Zheng Wanyin walked to the toll booth on the first floor.

“It was Sunday, and there was a long queue at the toll booth. ”

“Zheng Wanyin looked up at Zhou Xiang and said, “Second aunt.” ”

“Yes.”

“Zheng wanyin continued, “Second aunt, what happened today was all my fault. If it weren’t for me, Grandma wouldn’t have fainted, and cousin-in-law wouldn’t have been suspected for no reason. If you want to blame someone, blame me. Don’t be angry at Grandma! Grandma is already over 70 years old this year. How many 70 years can she live? “I hope that Grandma can live a happy old age. If you have any anger, just come at me.” ”

Zheng Wanyin’s attitude towards admitting her mistake was very sincere.

“Zhou Xiang was also a soft-hearted person. She couldn’t bear to see others shed tears in front of her. “Wanyin, she is my mother. How can I be angry with my own mother?” ”

“So you’re saying that you’re not angry with Grandma?”Zheng Wanyin asked in surprise.

Zhou Xiang nodded. “No.”

“Zheng Wanyin broke into a smile through her tears. “Second aunt, thank you! Please rest assured. I will definitely solemnly apologize to cousin-in-law and ask her to forgive me.” ”
