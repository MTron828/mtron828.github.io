“Okay.”Yu Zifei nodded.

Yu Zifei’s mother didn’t say anything more.

“After dinner, Yu Zifei brought a cake and lit a candle. The father and son worked together to sing a happy birthday song to Yu Zifei’s mother. ”

The candlelight reflected Yu Zifei’s mother’s smiling face.

This was the most meaningful birthday she had in more than fifty years.

“Yu Zifei smiled and said, “Mom, close your eyes and make a wish.” ”

“”Okay.”Yu Zifei’s mother put her hands together, closed her eyes, and began to make a wish. ”

“Yu Zifei immediately used his eyes to signal for Father Yu to send a gift. Although Father Yu was a little straight, he was not a fool. He could naturally read Yu Zifei’s eyes. He immediately took out a gift from his pocket. When Yu Zifei’s mother opened her eyes.., she smiled and said, “Zhifang, happy birthday. This is the birthday gift I prepared for you.” ”

“Mother Yu was stunned for a moment before she continued, “You... you prepared this for me?” ”

“Hearing this, although father Yu felt a little guilty, he still pretended to be calm. “Yes, I specially bought it for you.” ”

“But didn’t you just say that you forgot my birthday?”Mother Yu questioned.

“Yu Zifei smiled and replied, “Dad wanted to give you a surprise.” ”

“Yes.”Father Yu immediately nodded in agreement.

“Mother Yu took father Yu’s gift. For some reason, her eyes were slightly red. She had been with Father Yu for so many years, and this was the first time father Yu had given her a gift. ”

“Seeing his wife like this, father Yu felt a little ashamed. ”

“The next day, Yu Zifei rushed back to Mars. ”

Everything was going according to plan. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Wen Zhi was also reporting to his superiors every day.

At the same time.

In C Nation.

“Mi Jia Di sat in front of her office and looked at the information Wen Zhi sent over. She frowned slightly and turned to look at her companion beside her. She said hesitantly, “Do you think that something is wrong?” ”

Kevin turned around. “What’s Wrong?”

“”According to Ye Zhuo’s IQ, she should have noticed something.”Mi Jia Di felt that everything was going too smoothly. ”

“After all, Ye Zao was also the person who created the lightspeed aircraft carrier. ”

“Upon hearing this, Kevin Laughed Softly, “You’re thinking too much. There is a saying in China that says that the wisest will be hurt. This saying is very suitable to describe ye Zao. No matter how powerful ye Zao is, she is only a woman. Moreover, if she really discovered something, she would definitely not be as calm as she is now! “The press conference is in six days. Unless she is a fool, she will not move!” ”

“”What you said makes some sense, but I am still a little worried.”Mi Jiadi continued, “Is this Wen Zhi Reliable?” ”

“”Don’t worry, he is absolutely reliable!”Kevin continued, “His entire family is in my hands.” ”

“Wen Zhi took a large sum of money from Kevin and then moved his entire family to C country. Unless Wen Zhi did not want to live anymore, otherwise, he would not betray him. ”

“Moreover, Kevin had also installed a chip in Wen Zhi’s body. ”

“Okay.”Mi Jia di nodded.

“Kevin smiled and said, “I understand your current mood. It’s normal to be anxious, but I can tell you with certainty that your worries are unnecessary. We just need to wait for the press conference in six days.” ”

“Six days later, they would be able to see ye Zao Fall. ”

“When that time came, the scene would definitely be very exciting! ”

“Thinking of this, the corners of Kevin’s mouth curled up. ”

“At this moment, Kevin received another message. ”

“Hearing the beeping sound, Mi Jiadi immediately turned around and asked, “Is it from Wenzhi?” ”

Kevin nodded.

“What did he say?”Mi Jiadi immediately asked.

“Kevin looked at the communication device and was instantly overjoyed. He smiled and said, “The vegetation on Mars has already shown a large area of death. Now, Ye Zao is scratching his ears and cheeks to find the reason!” ”

Ye Zao probably did not even dream that she was the cause of all this.

“Really?”Mi Jiadi was also very excited after hearing the news.

“Kevin nodded. “Wen Zhi sent it. Look, there’s another video.” ”

“In the video, the originally flourishing vegetation on Mars was withering at the speed of light. The small animals that were resting in the forest were also falling one after another. ”

“It was originally a very sad video, but when Mi Jia Di saw this, she could not help but laugh out loud. ”

“All her hard work had been destroyed overnight. At this time, Ye Zhuo must be devastated! ”

“If it was not for the fear of exposing Wen Zhi, Kevin would have immediately sent this video to the news media. ”
