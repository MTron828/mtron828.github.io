“If ye Zao had not mentioned it, Cen Shaoqing would have almost forgotten about it. ”

“In a moment, CEN Shaoqing took out a small chip from his bag. ”

“When was this?”Ye Zao picked up the chip.

“CEN Shaoqing said, “On the day you came back.” ”

“What did you find in the chip?”Ye Zao asked.

Cen Shaoqing shook his head slightly.

These robots had very clean hands and feet. There was no trace of them at all.

“Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddha beads and continued, “However, I feel that the core robots this time are different from the previous ones.” ”

“Ye Zao studied the chip and slowly said, “They are indeed different, but they are all from the General Alliance.” ”

“Can you tell where they’re from?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“Ye Zao took out the device and installed the chip inside, then said, “If I’m not wrong, this core robot should be from the Wang family.” ”

“The Wang Family?”

“”Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly. “The Wang family is also a big family in the main alliance. How about this, I’ll sort out a set of information and send it to you later.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing said, “Okay.” ”

“Take my pulse.”Cen Shaoqing suddenly extended his hand that was holding the Buddha bead in front of ye Zao.

Ye Zao was stunned. “You’re not feeling well?”

“CEN Shaoqing said, “I suspect that there’s a chip in my body too.” ”

Cen Shaoqing had not noticed it before.

Until this time.

“He always felt that there was something in his body that was restricting his actions, especially when it came to technology and data. His mind could not get out of that circle. It was as if he had entered a dead end. ”

Ye Zhuoxiu frowned slightly and reached out to grab Cen Shaoqing’s wrist.

...

At the same time.

S galaxy.

The main alliance country.

“Seeing that time was passing bit by bit and there was still no movement from the young master of Dongli, Duanmu Feng couldn’t sit still any longer. ”

It was fine if it was someone else.

But she was different.

“After all, she was going to marry the young master of Dongli in the future and look at the World side by side. ”

“Although they were not bound by the marriage contract, the girls of the Duanmu family had always wanted to be the wife of the Chief Alliance. ”

This had nothing to do with the marriage contract.

It was just a pity that the next chief alliance could not be born from her stomach.

“Thinking of this, Duanmu Fengyu narrowed her eyes and a cold glint flashed across her eyes. ”

No.

She had to break this rule and give birth to an heir.

Duanmu Fengyu could not bear to have a child who was not related to her by blood call her mother.

She could not stand to watch another child climb to the top.

She was different from Duanmu Fengfei.

Duanmu Fengfei was willing to sink to the bottom. She could actually tolerate an earthling taking a dump on her head.

She could not!

“Therefore, she had to set it up in advance before everything happened. ”

“With this in mind, a determined look flashed across Duanmu Fengyu’s eyes. She picked up the microphone on the table and dialed the assistant’s number. “Mei Lin, come in for a moment.” ”

“”Yes, miss. .”The assistant’s voice came from the microphone. ”

“Soon, Wang Mei Lin came in. ”

“Miss. . Do you have any orders?”Wang Mei Lin looked respectfully at Duanmu Fengyu.

In her heart.

Duanmu Fengyu was probably the only person in the entire s galaxy who could stand shoulder to shoulder with young Miss Ye. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Although Duanmu Fengyu was a woman, she never felt inferior to men, nor did she feel inferior to her peers. At the same time, she was especially ruthless towards herself. ”

“Ten years ago, in order to successfully enter the upper string academy, she didn’t hesitate to cut off her own flesh. ”

“The only difference was that Duanmu Feng and Ye Zho had grown up rich, so they were born more noble than others. ”

“Ye Zho, on the other hand, had walked step by step. ”

It hadn’t been easy for her to change from a lonely and helpless vagrant girl to miss ye who was famous throughout Chang Yue!

“Therefore, Duanmu Feng and Miss Ye were the people whom Wang Mei Lin admired the most in her heart. ”

“If they had to choose who was better, then ye Zho would definitely be ranked first. ”

Duanmu Fengyu looked at Wang Meilin. “Did you arrange for the core robots that I asked you to send to Earth?”

“I did.”Wang Meilin nodded.

“How is it? Have you found young master?”Duanmu Fengyu asked impatiently.

“Wang Meilin continued, “I did find him, but young master found him very quickly. The core robots that were sent over have already self-destructed.” ”

“After saying that, Wang Mei Lin was initially worried that Duanmu Feng would blame her for not doing her job properly. Unexpectedly, Duanmu Feng laughed out loud instead. ”

Laugh?

“Wang Mei Lin almost thought that she was hallucinating. She widened her eyes to take a look, but the scene in front of her did not change. ”
