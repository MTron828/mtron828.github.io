Translator: 549690339

What does the cheapskate father want?

To get back together?

“”Ah Ze, this is your mother.”Lin Jincheng turned to look at Lin Ze. ”

“Lin Ze took heavy steps and walked step by step to Ye Shu’s side. He looked at Ye Shu and said in a hoarse voice, “Mother!” ”

Ye Shu was completely stunned.

Wasn’t this the child of him and Feng Qianhua?

What did he want to do?

Did he still want to lie to her like he did nineteen years ago?

“Ye Shu looked up at Lin Jincheng and asked in a trembling voice, “Lin Qingcheng, what do you want to Do?” ”

It had been nineteen years. Why did Lin Jincheng still appear in front of her? And why did he bring the son he had with someone else to look for her? !

She was living a good life now. Why did Lin Jincheng come here to tear open the scar that had already been scabbed.

“”Ah Shu, this is our son, Lin Ze. He and our daughter are twins, Ah Shu! I’ve let you down. I’ve separated you, mother, son, and brother and sister for so many years. I deserve to die! I’m A Sinner!”At this point, lin Jincheng was already in tears. ”

Twins?

Ye Shu only felt her mind go blank. She had never thought that she had a son in this world.

Was this true?

The youth in front of her was really her son.

“Lin Jincheng had lied to her before. From his name to his home address, he had lied to her. Could it be that this time, he was also lying to her? ”

Ye Shu didn’t know if she should believe Lin Jincheng.

Ye Zhuo stood at the side and was also a little dumbfounded.

This was too unbelievable!

She never expected that she actually had a brother...

A brother?

“”But... didn’t the doctor say that there was a stillborn child?”After a long while, Ye Shu finally found her voice. “Lin Jincheng, are you lying to me again?” ”

“Lin Jincheng took a deep breath. “Ah Shu, I’m not lying to you. That child wasn’t stillborn. He was secretly taken away by my mother. If you don’t believe me, you can do a paternity test with Ah Ze.” ”

“Hearing this, Ye Shu raised her head and looked at Lin Ze. ”

“From Lin Ze’s eyes, she saw her own figure. ”

It was her child.

“This was her child, that’s right. ”

“Perhaps it was the bond between mother and son, but at this moment, ye Shu almost burst into tears. She hugged Lin Ze. “Child, child...”she had always thought that her child had died when he was born. ”

She did not expect him to still be alive.

“Lin Ze had dreamed countless times of meeting his mother, but every time, the moment they hugged, the dream would wake up. ”

“Every night, his pillow would be wet. ”

“This time, he finally got to hug his mother as he wished. It was so good to have a mother. ”

“From now on, he was a child with a mother! ”

“”Mom!”Lin Ze hugged ye Shu tightly. He was very strong, afraid that he was dreaming. Once he let go, his mother would disappear. ”

“Seeing the mother and son recognize each other, Ye Sen raised his hand and punched Lin Jincheng. “B * Stard! You actually secretly took the child away! You separated them for so many years. Is this a human thing?” ”

Lin Jincheng didn’t Dodge. He took a punch from ye Sen and staggered back. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry for Shu and the two children...”

“”What’s the use of saying sorry?”Ye Sen gave Lin Jincheng another punch, “Can an apology offset the pain of their separation for so many years? Lin Qingcheng! Are you even human? How could you do such a heartless thing with your mother?” ”

“”I didn’t know that my mother secretly took ah ze away.”Lin Jincheng wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth, “That year, when I received the news that Ah Shu was going to give birth, I drove all the way to Yun Jing overnight. Who knew that I met with a car accident on the way. As a result, I lay in bed for ten years. When I woke up, I found that I had lost all my memories of Ah Shu... ... ...” ”

“By the end of his speech, Lin Jincheng was already sobbing uncontrollably. ”

“If he had been more careful that year and had not met with that car accident, ye Shu would not have suffered so much, and the mother and son would not have been separated for so many years because of it. ”

“If he had been braver back then, he would have taken ye Shu away earlier, and nothing would have happened. ”

“Unfortunately, there were no ifs. ”

“Ye Sen did not believe Lin Jincheng at all, because in his eyes, Lin Jincheng was a liar. He grabbed Lin Jincheng’s lapels and asked, “Didn’t you say that you lost your memory? Then how did you remember all this now?” ”

“... I accidentally recovered my memory last April.”Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com
