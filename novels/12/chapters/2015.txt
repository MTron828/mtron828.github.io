“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“”What about Zao Zao?”Grandma Fei asked, “Does Zao Zao have a boyfriend?” ”

“”Yes,”ye Zao said. ”

“Really?”Grandma Fei said in surprise.

“”Yes,”ye Zao continued, “Grandma Fei, don’t worry. When spring comes, Miss Ye will bring them to visit you.” ”

“”Good! Good!”Grandma Fei nodded continuously. “I wonder whose kid is so lucky to be able to chase after our Zao Zao! Now, only Little Ye Han is left!” ”

It was already past four in the afternoon when they returned from Grandma Fei’s side.

The Sun was setting in the West Mountains.

Grandma Fei looked in the direction where ye Zao had disappeared and a smile blossomed on her lips. “I knew that this girl was blessed with great fortune. She will definitely be fine!”

“Actually, Grandma Fei had recognized ye Zao as well, but she didn’t expose her. ”

“At this moment, the sound of footsteps came from the room, followed by a voice, “Mom, did anyone from our family come just now?” ”

Grandma Fei turned around. “No one.”

“Fei Yu asked curiously, “Who brought the pastries on the table?” ”

“”I bought them,”Grandma Fei said. ”

“Ye Zao had hidden himself so that no one would find out about her. At a time like this, Grandma Fei naturally wouldn’t give her any trouble. ”

Even if the other party was her own daughter.

“”OH.”Fei Yu did not suspect anything. She sat on the sofa and said, “Mother, the election is the day after tomorrow. Can You Guess Who the eight great clans are supporting this time?” ”

“Who?”Grandmother Fei asked.

“”It’s autumn flute.”Fei Yu continued, “It’s the daughter of autumn town, autumn flute. Speaking of which, autumn flute’s methods are really amazing. She has even caused the eight great clans to defect!” ”

“Hearing this, Fei Yu’s grandmother furrowed her brows. “This person is someone that the eight great clans can support just because they want to? Can she pass the Ye family’s base?” ”

“She wanted to step on ye Zhuo to rise to the top, but she didn’t even look at whose ye family’s base was! ”

“Fei Yu opened the pastry and picked one up. As she ate, she said, “Mother, you don’t know about this, right? That Ye Lan has long betrayed Miss Ye! I heard that she almost killed the people who supported miss ye that morning!” ”

“What? !”Grandma Fei’s face was filled with disbelief. “Who did you say betrayed her?”

“”Ye Lan!”Fei Yu continued, “Anyway, Miss Ye is gone now! The Ye family base is no longer the same base as before!” ”

“Fei Yu had a good friend who was a member of the Ye family base. Therefore, she was relatively clear about what happened in the Ye family base. ”

“After saying that, Fei Yu sighed, then, she said, “However, Ye Lan’s betrayal is also Miss Ye’s own fault! “If it wasn’t for Miss Ye stopping ye Lan from finding her biological parents, Ye Lan would definitely not have betrayed Miss Ye! “Mother, I heard that ye Lan seems to be of royal descent. Miss Ye was jealous of Ye Lan’s birth, so she deliberately prevented ye Lan from finding her biological parents!” ”

“”Bullsh * T!”Grandma Fei slapped the table and stood up, her face red with anger. ”

“Fei Yu jumped in fright. “Mother! What are you doing! You Scared Me! I didn’t say this, I heard it from somewhere else! Besides, there’s no smoke without fire, if...” ”

“”Shut up!”Grandma Fei slapped Fei Yu directly. “Let me tell you, anyone can gossip behind your back, but our family can’t! Have you forgotten how your luxurious life came about?” ”

“If it wasn’t for ye Zao, would the Fei family have the life they have now? ”

It was impossible!

Fei Yu was stunned by her mother’s slap. Her eyes were red and she did not speak.

“Grandma Fei continued, “Let me tell you, burning is not that kind of person! Not only did she shoulder all the bad things in the past, she is now being blamed and betrayed by others! Ye Lan! Where Is Ye Lan Now?” ”

“”In the base,”said Fei Yu. ”

Grandma Fei picked up her coat and put it on. “I’m going to Ye Lan’s ungrateful person now! Wait for me at home!”

“... Okay.”

Grandma Fei sat on the aircraft and rushed to the base without stopping.

“Just as she was about to enter, she was stopped by the guards. ”

“Grandma Fei said, “My name is Fei Susu. I’m looking for ye Lan.” ”

“Looking for our chief?”The guards sized up Grandma Fei.

Chief?

Grandma Fei snorted coldly.

“Ye Lan, this SH * t who sold herself for Glory, deserved to be the chief! ”

How disgusting!

“Just as the guards were about to say something, Zhou Qing walked over from the side and said with a smile, “Ah! Isn’t this Grandma Fei? Please come in!” ”

“After saying that, Zhou Qing looked at the guards and reprimanded, “You guys are blind! You Don’t even recognize Miss Ye’s grandmother!” ”
