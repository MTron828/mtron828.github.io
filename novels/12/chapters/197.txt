Chapter 198: 089: Lin Jin city’s secret, brother Ze who dug up the trap, domineering online! 4

“Yes, of course, of course!”

After repeatedly thanking him, the woman left with the child.

Li Qiandong looked at this scene in surprise. “You, you don’t know each other?”

Mu Yourong shook her head slightly.

Hearing this, Li Qiandong was even more shocked.

Just now, he thought that the little boy was a relative of Mu Yourong.

If he was not a relative, who would be able to save him?

He did not expect that Mu Yourong did not know him at all!

To be able to do this to a person she did not know, it could be seen from this that Mu Yourong was really a very kind person.

He had not misjudged the person!

A look of appreciation appeared in Li Qiandong’s eyes.

“Miss Mu, are you alright? I’ll send you to the hospital to have a look, right?”

Mu Yourong shook her head. “I’m fine. How could I be so weak? Mr. Li, you don’t have to feel burdened. I really don’t have any problems at all.”

......

Li Qiandong continued, “No matter what, you’ve been shocked today. Let me treat miss mu to a meal. Otherwise, I won’t be able to live with my conscience.”

Mu Yourong naturally couldn’t reject Li Qiandong’s invitation. She half-heartedly agreed.

It was also at this moment that the system’s voice sounded in Mu Yourong’s mind.

[ host, Congratulations! Li Qiandong’s favorability towards you has successfully increased to 85% ! ]

The corners of Mu Yourong’s lips curled up.

Nothing that she took a fancy to could escape from her grasp.

Li Qiandong should be her stepping stone.

...

At the same time.

In the capital.

At the Feng residence.

In the kitchen, Feng Qianhua was making health-preserving soup for Old Lady Lin.

Suddenly, a strange voice sounded in the air, “Qianhua, you’re really good to Old Lady Lin! It’s a pity that Old Lady Lin is old Lady Lin and Lin Jincheng is Lin Jincheng. Why did you have to persist for so long for something that was impossible? “In the end, it was all for naught.”

Feng Qianhua turned around and saw that it was Cheng Fengqin.

“Second sister-in-law doesn’t have to worry about my matters.”

Cheng Fengqin smiled. “I didn’t want to worry about it, but who asked some people to eat and drink our family’s money all these years?”

In this big family.

The one who really held the power was Old Lady Feng.

She distributed pocket money to the younger generation every month.

Originally, the four daughters-in-law of the Feng family could receive two million pocket money each month.

Because of the presence of Feng Qianhua and her daughter.

She could only receive 1.2 million a month!

It had been a whole 19 years.

She ate from her mother’s family, and she didn’t know how to be grateful.

The mother and daughter didn’t know when they could get out of the Lin family.

Feng Qianhua held back the anger in her heart and didn’t say anything.

Just wait!

One day, she would make everyone in the Feng family rush over to please her!

Cheng Fengqin snorted coldly and left the kitchen.

At this moment, Feng Qianxian came to the kitchen to get dessert.

“Qianxian, watch the fire for me. I’m going to the bathroom and will be back soon. You must watch it yourself, okay?”When she said the last sentence, Feng Qianhua’s expression became extremely serious.

It was as if it was not a health tonic, but a priceless treasure.

“OH.”Feng Xianxian nodded.

Feng Qianhua was still a little worried. When she walked out of the door, she turned back and instructed, “Xianxian, before I come back, you are not allowed to leave the kitchen. Remember to stay close to me.”

Feng Xianxian nodded impatiently.

Feng Qianhua came outside.

Breathing in the air outside, she felt a little more relaxed.

She couldn’t wait any longer.

This year, she had to marry into the Lin family.

If this dragged on...

She really wouldn’t have a chance.

Feng Qianhua went to the bathroom and made a call.

Twenty minutes later, she went to the kitchen again.

However, Feng Qianxian was no longer in the kitchen. Instead, the maid had replaced Feng Qianxian.

Feng Qianhua’s expression turned cold. “Where’s Xianxian?”

The servant said, “Miss said that she went back to her room to read.”

Feng Qianhua frowned. “I’m fine as long as I’m here. You can go out first! Oh right, call Xianxian over.”

The servant nodded and turned to leave the kitchen.

Soon, Feng Xianxian arrived and said with some dissatisfaction,

“Mom, why did you call me over? The college entrance exam is coming up soon, and I still want to read...”

“Slap!”

Before Feng Xianxian could finish her sentence, Feng Qianhua gave her a hard slap.

Everything happened too quickly. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Feng Xianxian was stunned.

Her face was burning with pain as she looked at Feng Qianhua in disbelief. “Mom! Why did you hit me? What did I do wrong?”

Feng Qianhua’s expression was very ugly. “Who told you to leave! Didn’t I tell you to stay here and look after the medicine?”
