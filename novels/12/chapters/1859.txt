Who let autumn flute in?

“In the Chang Yue country, besides Ye Zhuo, no matter who came to the headquarters of the eight great clans, they had to make an appointment in advance. ”

“Last Time, Ye Han was an accident. ”

“After all, Ye Han was ye Zhuo’s only younger brother, and also his only confidant. ”

“He originally thought that when he saw ye Han, he would have news of ye Zhuo. Who would have thought that ye Han actually forgot everything and betrayed Ye Zhuo. ”

“Autumn flute was someone who knew how to read People’s expressions. When he saw that the first chief’s expression was not right.., he immediately said, “Chief Shangguan, I know that you have to make an appointment to see me. This is not anyone’s fault. Please don’t misunderstand the guards at the door. I came in through this.” ”

“As he finished speaking, autumn flute took out the wooden tablet. ”

“When he saw the wooden tablet, the first chief was stunned. ”

Where did Qiu di get the wooden token?

Stole it?

What could a person like Qiu di not do?

“Qiu di continued, “Great Patriarch, I know that you have a misunderstanding about me. You think that I’m inferior to Miss Ye in every way. And I’m indeed inferior to Miss Ye. However, please rest assured. Although I’m not an outstanding great figure, I’m definitely not someone as unbearable as you imagine... ... .. ”

“Previously, it was autumn flute who thought things were too simple. She had always thought that as long as she could subdue ye Han, she would be able to win the general election. Now, it seemed that if she wanted to pass the general election, she had to pass through the eight great clans. ”

“When facing the eight great clans, she couldn’t forcefully take them, she could only take them by intelligence. ”

Autumn flute hadn’t finished her sentence when she was directly interrupted by the great clan leader. “What do you mean by coming here today?”

“”Head chief, Listen to me.”Qiu Di was not angry at being interrupted by the head chief. On the contrary, he was smiling, he continued, “Actually, before Miss Ye met me, she said that she and I are fated. If anything happens to her in this experiment, she hopes that I can replace her and complete her unfinished mission.” ”

The head patriarch looked at Qiu Di. The mockery in his eyes could be clearly seen. “Miss Ye met you?”

How was that possible!

“If ye Zao really had some sort of friendship with Qiu Di, it was impossible for the eight great clans not to know anything about it. ”

It was clearly Qiu di speaking nonsense! ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“This kind of person was really too terrifying. In order to achieve his goal, he would say anything. ”

“”Yes.”Qiu Di nodded slightly, then, she said, “Actually, I met Miss Ye once 16 years ago. Miss ye is a grateful person. Back then, I merely saved Miss Ye’s life, and she remembers it to this day. “It’s not your fault for being loyal to her. Miss ye is indeed worthy of everyone’s loyalty!” ”

“In any case, Ye Zao was already dead. There was no evidence to prove his death, and she had indeed met ye Zao once 16 years ago. ”

“Unless ye Zao could come back from the dead, otherwise, no one would ever be able to expose her lies. ”

But she was already dead. Could she come back to life?

“Naturally, she couldn’t. ”

“Hearing this, the great clan leader was stunned. ”

Qiu Di had actually saved ye Zao!

How was this possible?

“Ye Zao was a grateful person. If Qiu Di had really saved her, she wouldn’t have been so cold towards Qiu Di. ”

“Qiu Di observed the changes in the DA clan leader’s expression and spoke softly, “Great clan leader, I know that you may not believe everything I’ve said, but what I’ve said is true. “Actually, I didn’t want to say all of this, but when I thought of what Miss Ye had told me before she died, I couldn’t let her down. “So, after thinking for a long time, I decided to say all of it.” ”

“”Miss Ye was an orphan. That year, when I met her, she was only six years old. “My father originally wanted to keep her as a servant for me, but I saw that she was the same age as me and still had injuries on her body. She was really pitiful, so he asked the doctor to come over and treat her injuries. He also gave her a sum of money. “After this, I never met her again. When I met her again, she had already gone from that homeless child back then to Miss Ye, who was the focus of everyone in changyue.” ”

“”I originally thought that Miss ye no longer remembered me. Who would have thought that not only did miss ye remember me, but she also remembered that incident back then.” ”

“Hearing this, the chief frowned slightly, as if questioning the authenticity of Qiu Di’s words. ”

“In changyue, very few people knew that ye Zao was an orphan. ”

“But Qiu di knew everything. He even knew that sixteen years ago, Ye Zao was almost sold. ”

Could it be... ? ... that Qiu di was really ye Zhuo’s Savior?

“For a moment, the chief was also stunned. ”

“After a moment, the chief raised his head to look at Qiu Di and continued, “Just based on your words, why should I believe you?” ”
