“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “This matter indeed has nothing to do with Miss Ye. It’s only right for me to apologize to her. Yuyan, don’t be angry. It’s just an apology. It’s nothing.” ”

Song Chenyu copied the wechat message Xiao Li sent and posted it on Weibo.

“Song Chenyu V: [ regarding this matter, I want to apologize as well. Miss Ye. ]. ”

“Miss Ye, I’m sorry, I was wrong! ”

“I didn’t know what happened either. I was too seriously injured at that time. When I woke up, I saw the trending searches on Weibo and the photo taken by Yi Wan. ”

“At that time, I didn’t think so much. I combined Yi Wan’s Weibo to send the previous reply. ”

I didn’t know that my reply would cause so much harm to miss ye.

“I always believed that justice might be late, but it would never be absent. ”

Now Justice has arrived.

“Here, I want to say sorry to miss ye once again! ”

“If I had understood the situation at that time, perhaps these things wouldn’t have happened. It was my negligence that caused miss ye such great trouble! Not only do I want to apologize to Miss Ye, but I also want to say sorry to Miss Ye’s fans! ”

“I’m sorry to all the fans who believe in me, and I’m sorry to all of You!” ”

“This matter became more and more intense at night. Many netizens stayed up all night waiting for Song Chenyu’s response. As soon as song Chenyu’s Weibo post was posted, it immediately became a hot search. ”

# song Chenyu’s response #

# song Chenyu’s apology #

“[ interpretation: this matter is not my fault. If it wasn’t for song yiwan, I wouldn’t put the blame on Yezi! ] ”

[ likes supporting song Chenyu to get out of the entertainment industry. ]

[ ? ? ? Putting all the blame on song Yiwan? What kind of apology is this? ]

“[ wow, I threw up! ] ”

[ what a white lotus flower. ]

“[ what a good tea. Song Yiwan was obviously helping song Chenyu, but now that something happened, Song Chenyu put all the blame on song Yiwan. I admire song Chenyu’s tea skills! ] ”

“Brother Tao kept refreshing the comments. He did not expect the netizens to not buy song Chenyu’s response at all. He immediately initiated the public relations department to Censor, delete, and find the Troll Army to lead the way. ”

“[ Chenyu has already apologized. What more do you want? Moreover, this matter was not Chenyu’s fault in the first place. As an artist, it’s already very pitiful that his face was injured. What more do you people want? ] ”

“[ if it wasn’t for song Yiwan deliberately misleading him, Chenyu wouldn’t have posted a Weibo response. It was clearly song Yiwan’s fault. What right do you have to force it on Chenyu? ] ”

“[ if everyone wants to scold, Go Scold song Yiwan! These things were all caused by song Yiwan! What does it have to do with Chenyu? From a certain point of view, Chenyu is also a victim! ] ”

[ song Yiwan wants to ride on the Heat! ]

“Song Chenyu’s fan base was very good. With the comments of these netizens, some people were immediately led astray. ”

“[ be reasonable, this matter is indeed not Chenyu’s fault. Chenyu has been in the hospital for the past few days. When she wakes up, she will see song Yiwan’s Weibo. If you were in Chenyu’s shoes, what would you do? ] ”

[ this song Yiwan is really a troublemaker! ]

“[ Chenyu is also a victim. Moreover, she has already apologized. What more do you want? ] ”

“[ F * ck! It’s so disgusting! Even flies don’t bite seamless eggs. Even if this matter is song Yiwan’s fault, Song Chenyu is not a good person! NC fans are really amazing. They can even wash away this! ] ”

“[ song Chenyu is a victim? The victim is clearly yezi, okay? Yezi is the real person sitting at home. The pot comes from the sky! ] ”

“[ if an apology is useful, why do you need the police? I’ll give you a knife and then apologize to you. Will you accept it? ] ”

[ the onlookers should disperse. Chenyu is also a victim in this matter. The real mastermind is song Yiwan. ]

“After song Chenyu posted on Weibo, a group of people ran to ye Zao’s Weibo to comfort him. ”

Ye Zao’s Weibo account also had to eat melon today.

She had registered her Weibo account a year ago.

There were a total of 53 weibo posts.

“Of these 53 weibo posts, 50 were videos of food bloggers making desserts that ye Zao had forwarded. Only three of them were ye Zao’s own original Weibo posts. ”

Eat melons today: [ I really love wine making Yuanzi. [ photo jpg ]

Eat melons today: [ I suddenly realized that papaya is also quite delicious. [ photo jpg ]

The third Weibo post was that reply.

“[ I really feel sorry for Yezi. If Yezi didn’t have that video, he would have been wronged by song Yiwan and Song Chenyu. I don’t dare to imagine how Yezi would go on in the future if the accusation is proven true. ] ”
