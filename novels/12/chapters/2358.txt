Zhou Ying and Bai Jiasheng only regret that they didn’t curry favor with Lin Ze back then.

“If they had known that Lin Ze would end up like this, they definitely wouldn’t have objected to Bai Jingshu being with Lin Ze. ”

“Hopefully, it wasn’t too late. ”

“After all, they were still Bai Jingshu’s parents. ”

Zhou Ying and Bai Jiasheng immediately rushed to the Bai family’s old residence.

Bai Jingfei looked at the backs of her parents and found it very strange.

What was going on with Bai Jiasheng and Zhou Ying?

Why were they suddenly so concerned about Bai Jingshu’s matter?

Something didn’t seem right!

“At this moment, an excited female voice sounded in the air. ”

“Jingfei! Jingfei!”

Bai Jingfei looked up and saw her good friend Zheng Zhizhi running over.

“Zhizhi.”

“Zheng Zhizhi ran all the way to Bai Jingfei’s side. “Jingfei, Congratulations!” ”

“What’s there to congratulate?”Bai Jingfei was confused.

“Stop pretending! The rumors are going crazy!”Zheng Zhizhi held Bai Jingfei’s hand. “I really didn’t expect your sister to be so lucky!”

Bai Jingfei looked at Zheng Zhizhi with a puzzled look. “What exactly happened? Tell me more clearly.”

“You really don’t Know?”Zheng Zhizhi looked at Bai Jingfei.

“I don’t know.”Bai Jingfei shook her head.

She was very puzzled now. Why were her parents and Zheng Zhizhi like this.

“It was as if the whole world knew about a piece of news, and she was the only one who didn’t know. ”

“Bai jingfei continued, “Quickly tell me. Just now, my parents were like you. It was strange. They even said that they were going to attend my sister’s wedding and wanted to bless my sister.” ”

“”Since you don’t know, then let me tell you!”Zheng zhizhi continued, “Jingfei, your sister is rich! Do you know who she married?” ”

“”Earthling, Lin Ze!”Bai Jingfei replied. ”

Zheng Zhizhi shook his head. “Wrong!”

Bai jingfei frowned slightly. “What do you mean? Just tell me directly. Stop guessing riddles with me!”

“Zheng zhizhi continued, “Although Lin Ze looks like an ordinary, plain earthling, he has another identity!” ”

“What identity?”Bai Jingfei was very curious. He was just an earthling. What other identity could he have?

“Zheng Zhizhi narrowed his eyes. “You should know about the matter of the heir of the Shangguan family that caused a commotion a while ago, right?” ”

“Old Lady Shangguan had no children and her only grandchild had passed away unexpectedly. Therefore, she had chosen an heir. ”

“However, what everyone didn’t understand was that she wasn’t from the F galaxy. ”

“Therefore, everyone was guessing if this mysterious heir was from the s galaxy. ”

It was also why Bai Mo was so concerned about an ordinary person with the Shangguan surname in the s galaxy and even exchanged contact information.

“After all, he was the heir of the Shangguan family. If anyone could marry the future heir of the Shangguan family in advance, their future would be limitless! ”

“If Bai Mo could marry the future heir, she might even become the future mistress of the Shangguan family. ”

Bai jingfei nodded. “I know.”

Of course she knew about this.

But what did this have to do with Lin Ze?

“Bai Jingfei was a little speechless and said, “Don’t tell me that this heir is Lin Ze?” ”

Wasn’t this a fantasy? 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Unless Old Lady Shangguan was blind, she wouldn’t choose an Earthling as her heir! ”

“Hearing this, zheng zhizhi said excitedly, “You really guessed it right! That brother-in-law of yours is the future heir of the Shangguan Family!” ”

“”Stop joking, this joke isn’t funny at all.”Bai Jingfei didn’t take these words to heart, nor did she take them seriously. ”

Lin Ze was the heir?

How was that possible!

“”It’s true, I’m serious! I’m really not joking with you! Your brother-in-law is really the future heir of the Shangguan family. This was personally said by Old Lady Shangguan at the wedding!”Zheng Zhizhi pulled up the video of the wedding scene, “Look, this is a video recorded by the guests at the scene! Old Lady Shangguan even gave the family heirloom blood bracelet to your sister!” ”

Zheng Zhizhi’s words were filled with envy.

To be able to marry the future heir of the Shangguan family meant that one would have a bright future ahead of them. Who wouldn’t be envious of such a good thing?

Bai Jingfei looked at the wedding video taken at the scene and was stunned.

No wonder!

No wonder her parents had such a huge change. It was because of this.

“However, they had just signed a disconnection agreement with Bai Jingshu. At this moment, would Bai Jingshu still care about them? ”

Bai Jingshu’s luck was too good. Such a thing could happen to her.
