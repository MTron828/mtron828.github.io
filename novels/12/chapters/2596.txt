Translator: 549690339

“All these years, he had been working hard to earn money to support his family, trying to find ways to let Zhou cuihua live a better life. Who would have thought that this B * Tch Zhou cuihua would actually cheat on him outside! ”

“No matter which man, they could not bear the humiliation of being cuckolded. ”

“Li Dalong walked in front of Zhou cuihua, raised his hand, and gave Zhou cuihua a slap. ”

Bang.

This slap made Zhou cuihua fall to the ground.

“”B * Tch! You B * Tch!”After saying that, Li Dalong grabbed Zhou Cuihua’s hair and said angrily, “Who is that adulterer! Tell me! I’ll go kill him!” ”

Zhou Cuihua was hit until she was dizzy and couldn’t react for a long time.

She didn’t expect that Li Dalong would suddenly make a move.

“After all, Li Dalong had never made a move against her since they were married for so many years. ”

“But now, Li Dalong actually made a move to hit her! ”

“Li Dalong! Are you crazy? !”Zhou Cuihua was almost hysterical.

“”Crazy! I am indeed crazy!”Li Dalong pulled Zhou cuihua’s hair, “I actually didn’t notice the abnormality between you and the adulterer! Tell me, when did you two do it? !” ”

Li Da Long wished he could just kill Zhou Cui Hua.

He was really suffering.

“Zhou cui hua said, “Li da long, you are a coward, you are a coward who only knows how to hit women! If you have the guts, Divorce Me!” ”

“Divorce! Divorce Right Now!”Li Da Long’s eyes were bloodshot.

“Hearing this, a huge rock in Zhou Cui Hua’s heart finally fell to the ground. ”

She was about to be freed from this man who was not a man at all!

“Li Hang, who was in the back room, heard that something was not right outside and immediately opened the door. ” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“When he came to the living room, he was immediately stunned. ”

“”Dad, Mom, what are you guys doing?” ”

“When Li da long heard this, he immediately released Zhou Cuihua. ”

“Li hang ran to Zhou Cuihua’s side. “Mom, are you alright? Dad, how could you hit someone!” ”

She had thought that Zhou Cuihua was just casually complaining. Who would have thought that things would develop to this point.

Zhou cuihua hugged Li Hang and cried bitterly.

“Li Da long pointed at Zhou cuihua and said, “Ask her yourself, what shameful things did she do!” ”

“”Mom, what’s Going On?”Li hang looked at Zhou Cuihua. ”

Zhou Cuihua did not say anything.

“Li da long continued, “Tomorrow, go to the Civil Affairs Bureau Tomorrow and get the divorce certificate! Don’t even think about giving my things to that adulterer!” ”

Divorce!

“Hearing this, Li Hang immediately looked at Zhou Cuihua and said with wide eyes, “Mom, you want to divorce my dad?” ”

Zhou cuihua nodded.

Li Hang never dreamed that his parents would walk the path of divorce.

“”Why?”Li Hang was a little unwilling to see such a result. “Mom, why did you divorce Dad! Why!” ”

“Zhou Cuihua didn’t say anything, but quietly tugged at Li Hang’s sleeve. ”

“Li Hang looked at Zhou cuihua and somewhat understood the meaning in her eyes, so he didn’t say anything more. ”

“Li dalong continued, “Once things happen, they have to be resolved. Hang Hang Hang, your mom and I can’t go on. You’re already an adult. Tell me, who are you going to follow in the future?” ”

“He and Zhou Cui Hua only had one child, Li Hang. ”

“Other than property, it was also very important for Li Hang to appear in someone’s household register in the future. ”

“Li Hang was stunned for a moment before he continued, “Dad, do you really have to make me choose? Actually, I don’t feel that the matter is so serious that I have to get a divorce...” ”

“You have to get a divorce!”Li Da Long’s attitude was very firm. The reason why he did not say the reason was because he wanted to take into account the face of Zhou Cui Hua next week.

“A husband and wife had a hundred days of grace. After all, they still had Li hang as a bond between them. ”

“Li da long continued, “Hang Hang, you choose. With me or with her.” ”

“Li hang hesitated for a moment. He raised his head to look at Li da long and continued, “You are my father, and she is the mother I carried for ten months. The palms and backs of my hands are all flesh. If you insist on me choosing one, aren’t you making things difficult for me?” ”

“Seeing Li hang like this, Li da long wiped his tears. ”

“When parents walked down the path of divorce, the ones who suffered would always be their children. ”

“Fortunately, fortunately, Li Hang was now a big girl. ”

“After saying this, Li hang continued, “Father, if you insist on walking down this path, can you let me think about it first?” ”

“Yes.”Li Da long nodded.

“Zhou cuihua walked out from the ground, went to the bedroom, and began to tidy up her things. ”

“Just as she finished tidying up her jewelry, Li Dalong walked over and directly took away her jewelry box. “You can’t take anything except clothes!” ”
