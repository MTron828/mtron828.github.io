“Chapter 762: 170: face-smacking, a well-deserved first place! 3”

Translator: 549690339

“Of course!”

“I feel that Master Yu is already starting to regret it.”

“Another voice sounded, “It might not be that Miss Feng. I think there’s an 80% chance that it’s Zhao Tong.” ”

Zhao Tong was born in the literary world and had a deep literary background. It was normal for her to get first place.

“I’ll stand by Zhao Tong.”

“Then I’ll stand by Miss Feng!”

“For a moment, everyone was guessing who the person who got a perfect score was. ”

“Listening to the discussions of the crowd, Feng Xianxian smiled. ”

She was looking forward to the moment when the Chief Examiner announced the results.

At that time.

She would be the most eye-catching person in the crowd.

Master Yu would regret it too much!

“Now, even the top leaders of the literary world were alarmed. This meant that in the future, her position in the literary world would be even more honorable than Master Yu’s. ”

“When she thought of this, a mocking look appeared in Feng Xianxian’s eyes. ”

Who were those people who looked down on her?

“Twenty minutes later, all thirty papers were graded. ”

“Finally, it was time to announce the results. ”

“The head examiner stood on the stage and gave an opening speech. After a round of deafening applause, he announced the top ten contestants of the competition. ”

“”Now, let’s welcome the tenth-place winner, Yang Zifeng, to the stage. Congratulations, Yang Zifeng!” ”

The big screen displayed the scores of the tenth-place winner.

The full score was 100 points.

The tenth-place winner scored 79 points.

“Actually, it could be seen from the scores of the tenth-place winner that the exam this time was very difficult. ”

“In the past, the scores of the tenth-place winners were all within 90 points. ”

Yang Zifeng walked onto the stage under the applause of the crowd.

“”Next up is the ninth place, Wu Yue.” ”

The ninth place had 80 points.

The eighth place had 80.5 points.

The seventh place had 81 points.

“Very soon, he entered the top three. ”

“”Now, let’s invite the third place winner of the assessment, Zhou Miaoyan, to the stage.” ”

“Although Zhou Miaoyan did not get first place, she was already very satisfied to be able to enter the top three. After all, the examination questions this year were so difficult. ”

Fourth place received 85 points.

Zhou Miaoyan got 87 points.

“”Next, let’s invite the second-place winner of the assessment competition, Zhao Tong, to come up on stage.” ”

Second place?

Zhao Tong was actually second place.

“Seeing Zhao Tong come up on stage, there was a flurry of discussion below the stage. ”

“If Zhao Tong was second place, then there was a high possibility that the first place winner would be Feng Xianxian. ”

Wang Zhishu was stunned. “I didn’t expect Miss Feng to really get full marks.”

“Sun Openg sighed. “If Master Yu hadn’t taken Miss Ye as his disciple at that time, then the person who got full marks would have been from our sea of Books Association!” ”

Master Yu was the founder of the Sea of Books Association in the literary world.

There were a total of three conferences in the literary world.

“They were the Sea of Books Association, the Sea of Books Association, and the Sea of Poetry Association. ”

“Above the three presidents was Li Zhentian, the first seat. ”

“Although the Sea of Books Association appeared to be glorious on the surface, once something happened to Master Yu, the Big Dipper, the Sea of Books Association would be riddled with holes. ”

This was also the reason why Master Yu insisted on taking in ye Zao.

He wanted ye Zao to lead the literary world to a new peak.

He also hoped that the sea of books association would flourish in the hands of Ye Zao.

Unfortunately.

“In the end, master Yu still mistook the fish eye for a Pearl and missed out on a true talent. ”

Zheng Zikai looked at the stage. “The head examiner hasn’t announced the first place yet. How do you know it’s Miss Feng? What if it’s Miss Ye?”

“”Zikai, Stop Dreaming!”Wang zhishu continued, “There are more than 260 questions in total. Miss ye turned in her paper two hours in advance. How many questions do you think she can get right?” ”

“For someone like Ye Zhuo, to be able to get three questions right was like burning incense! ”

Zheng Zikai was actually still dreaming that ye Zhuo could get full marks.

It was simply a pipe dream!

“Zheng Zikai’s gaze was firm. “Anyway, it’s not the last moment yet. None of us can jump to conclusions.” ”

“Then what you mean is that Miss Feng didn’t even make it into the top ten?”Wang Zhishu asked back.

The main examiner had started reporting from the tenth place.

Feng Xianxian’s beautiful name was well-known. It was impossible that she didn’t make it into the top ten.

She wasn’t in the top nine.

This meant that Feng Xianxian was definitely in first place.

“Zheng zikai continued, “We don’t have a substantive understanding of Miss Ye. Everything is just hearsay. It’s the same for Miss Feng. What if Miss Feng really didn’t make it into the top ten? “Do you really believe that Miss Feng got full marks?” ”

“Wang Zhishu looked at Zheng Zikai. “Zikai, haven’t you heard of such a saying?” ”

“What saying?”Zheng Zikai asked.

“”The eyes of the masses are sharp.”If only one person had said that ye Zao had entered through the back door, it would have been fine. But now, everyone was saying that ye Zao had entered through the back door. ”
