Translator: 549690339

“The driver put on his seatbelt and said, “Little girl, I think you only dared to get your driver’s license. Can you do it? Young people should not rush...” ”

“Before he could finish his sentence, the car rushed out. ”

It was so fast that it was like an arrow leaving the bow.

“This, this was too fast, right? ”

The driver turned to look at ye Zao and gulped. His face was full of disbelief.

The little girl was quite a tiger!

“He had driven for so many years, but he did not dare to be like this. ”

“Truly, a newborn calf was not afraid of a tiger! ”

“”Little girl, slow down. In the past, I had a friend who was just like you. When he was driving, he was really fierce. Guess What Happened Now?” ”

“Huh?”Ye Zao turned the steering wheel with one hand and avoided a red sports car with a beautiful posture.

“The driver continued, “Now, the weeds on his grave are half the height of a person!” ”

“”Master, have you ever seen a racing driver?”Ye Zao asked. ”

“”No.”The driver was stunned for a moment and quickly reacted. “Little girl, do you mean that you are a racing driver?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo’s tone was indifferent.

“”Stop bragging, your driver’s license says that you’ve just turned 20 this year.”The driver smiled. ”

“Little Girls nowadays, when they bragged, they didn’t even bother to write a draft! ”

“”Race car driver?”The driver continued, “Why didn’t you say that you know how to fly a plane?” ”

“Ye Zhuo’s eyebrows were still the same, “I’ve never touched a plane before, but I’ve flown a spaceship before.”In the world that Ye Zhuo lived in, spaceships were common, just like the current high-speed rail, as long as he raised his head.., he could see disc-shaped flying saucers and rectangular spaceships flying in the sky. ”

“As for airplanes, they had long been eliminated. ”

A spaceship? !

Why didn’t she say that she could fly?

“The driver was speechless. “Little girl, are you still dreaming?” ”

Ye Zao didn’t say anything. He stepped on the accelerator and continued to accelerate.

The soundproof effect of the taxi’s windows wasn’t very good. The driver could even hear the sound of the wind and lightning.

Whoosh! Whoosh!

“At this moment, the driver turned his head to look ahead, his pupils suddenly dilating. “Slow down, slow down, slow down, don’t just brag! We’re about to hit! Slow down!” ”

But Ye Zao did not show any intention of slowing down.

They were about to hit!

The driver was so scared that he closed his eyes.

This morning was too unlucky!

How could he meet such a girl who only knew how to Brag! Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“It’s over, it’s over! ”

“The car was moving so fast. He wouldn’t die, right? ”

Amitabha.

Buddha bless!

The cold sweat on the driver’s forehead almost instantly appeared.

“One second passed, two seconds passed, three seconds passed. ”

The imagined pain did not come at the right time.

What was going on?

The driver opened his eyes curiously and saw that ye Zao had already avoided the car.

Strange.

It was really too strange.

She clearly did not slow down. How did she manage to avoid the car without making a sound?

“Just as the driver was slightly stunned, ye Zao swung her tail beautifully and directly left the cars in front of her behind. ”

So handsome!

“The driver turned to look at ye Zao, his eyes filled with shock. ”

“If he didn’t see it with his own eyes, who would believe it was real? ”

The driver quickly looked behind through the window and saw that the cars that ye Zao had overtaken had been left behind.

Chi —

Another beautiful tail swing and the car stopped in front of an abandoned factory.

Ye Zhuo unfastened his seatbelt and pushed the door open to get out.

The driver was still in a daze in the passenger seat.

“Ye Zhuo went to the other side and opened the door of the passenger seat. “Sir, how much is it?” ”

“Only then did the driver come to his senses. He looked at the meter and said, “18 yuan.” ”

It was just a starting price.

“Yan ‘an road was 35 kilometers away from the previous place. Normally, it would take at least 34 minutes to drive, but this little girl only took less than 10 minutes to drive there. ”

“Ye Zhuo took out 20 and gave it to the driver, “Keep the change.” ”

“The driver called out to ye Zhuo’s back, “Little girl, wait, wait a minute!” ”

“Ye Zhuo looked back slightly, “Is there anything else?” ”

“”You, you aren’t really a race car driver, right?”The driver asked in disbelief. ”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“The driver swallowed his throat. Just as he was about to ask the second question, Ye Zhuo had already gone far away. ”

“She, she can’t really drive a spaceship, right? ”

The driver scratched his head.
