“Mi Jiadi patted Wen Zhi on the shoulder and said, “Alright, Kevin, Take Mr. Wen Zhi downstairs to rest.” ”

“”Okay.”Kevin nodded and made a ‘please’gesture. “Mr. Wen Zhi, please.” ”

Wen Zhi turned around to greet mi Jiadi before turning around to leave.

Mi Jiadi looked at Wen Zhi’s back and narrowed her eyes slightly.

The Celebration Party was held at six o’clock in the evening as scheduled.

“Without a doubt, Wen Zhi became the most dazzling person in the crowd. ”

“The next day, Wen Zhi turned on the spacecraft and flew to Mars. ”

Today was the third last day of the press conference.

“Everyone on the base was in a hurry, trying to bring the Mars base back to life in the last three days. ”

“Wen Zhi pulled a person who was in a hurry. “Little Wu, wait.” ”

“Little Wu was wearing heavy glasses. When she saw Wen Zhi, she asked, “Wen Zhi, when did you come back?” ”

“I just came back.”

“Little Wu continued, “How’s Auntie?” ”

“Wen Zhi was stunned for a moment. Then, he thought of his excuse and immediately put on a sorrowful look, “It’s a lucky escape! Little Wu, you don’t know. I thought yesterday that I would never see my mother again.” ”

“It’s good that Auntie is fine.”Little Wu patted Wen Zhi on the shoulder. “The world is unpredictable. Treat Auntie better in the future.”

“”Yes, I know.”Wen Zhi nodded and continued, “By the way, during the day that I was away, did anything big happen at the base?” ”

“For example, did ye Zao discover the agreement? ”

“If ye Zao found the document, he had to leave immediately and not stay on Mars for even a moment! ”

“However, looking at the current situation, ye Zao probably did not discover anything. ”

Xiao Wu shook his head. “Nothing major happened.”

“Hearing this, Wen Zhi heaved a sigh of relief and continued, “Then how is the Oasis Project? Did Miss Ye find a way to revive those animals and plants?” ”

“Hearing this, Little Wu sighed. “Although Miss Ye is powerful, she’s not a god. How could she find a way in such a short time! I think Miss Ye is really going to die this time!” ”

“”Don’t worry, there are still three days left! Who Is Miss Ye? She will definitely bring us a miracle in the last three days!”Wen Zhi said with a determined expression, if people who did not know saw that, they would think that he was loyal to Ye Zao. ”

“Xiao Wu looked around, he lowered his voice and said, “It’s not that I don’t trust Miss Ye, but this matter is too troublesome! To tell you the truth, I’m starting to regret coming to Mars. If I had known this would happen, I would have stayed on Earth obediently. Now, I’ve picked up the sesame but lost the watermelon!” ”

“Speaking of this, Little Wu was very regretful. Before he had decided to come to Mars, his family had strongly opposed it. However, he seemed to have been possessed and insisted that ye Zhuo would definitely bring a miracle to everyone. ”

“Now, things were looking up. ”

“Ye Zhuo’s Oasis project had failed, and so had the plan to move humans to Mars! ”

“Wen Zhi smiled and said, “Don’t say that. In any case, I believe in Miss Ye!” ”

“”I was the same as you before. Now, I can see that it’s better to believe in yourself than anyone else,”Xiao Wu said. ”

“Wen Wen narrowed his eyes and continued to ask, “Miss Ye has studied for so many days, but there’s no effect at all. Could it be that she wants to give us a surprise?” ”

“”Surprise?”Xiao Wu continued, “If it really is a surprise, that would be great. When I passed by Miss Ye’s office yesterday, I saw that Miss Ye’s eyes were red. She should be anxious. After all, she has put in so much effort for the OASIS project.” ” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Hearing this, Wen Zhi also pretended to sigh. “Sigh, I didn’t expect Miss Ye to make a mistake.” ”

“In short, it was because ye Zhuo was too conceited that he could make everything go so smoothly! ”

“Xiao Wu continued, “Actually, Miss Ye is also very powerful. After all, she created a miracle in the field of aerospace, making our China the first country to land on the eight planets! “She has also created the first aircraft carrier in history to surpass the speed of light!” ”

“”That’s right!”The text continued, “That’s why I admire miss ye so much! “It doesn’t matter even if she fails this time. Miss ye is still young, and her path in life is still very long. I believe that in the days to come, she will definitely create even more miracles!” ”

Xiao Wu nodded. “Let’s Hope so!”
