Translator: 549690339

Lin Ze frowned slightly.

He had spent a lot of effort to find the Yuan Chao Records. There were also some of his thoughts and information that he had found.

The reason why it was placed in the library was to let more people see the charm of ancient culture.

“But now, the person in charge of the library actually told him that the Yuan dynasty records were lost! ”

“Seeing Lin Ze’s expression turn from sunny to dark.., xia Shang immediately said, “Mr. Lin, Mr. Lin, don’t be anxious. Don’t worry, we have already reported it to the police station and offered a reward of 100,000 yuan to find it. If we really can’t find it, we can compensate you at the original price.” ”

“Actually, Xia Shang didn’t want to inform Lin Ze so quickly. ” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The police didn’t have any clues either.

The book seemed to have disappeared into thin air.

“There were a total of 328 cameras in the library, but they couldn’t find the reason for the disappearance of the real records of the Yuan dynasty. ”

“Lin Ze continued, “When was the book lost?” ”

“”The day before yesterday,”Xia Shang said. ”

“Where was it lost?”Lin Ze asked again.

“Xia Shang answered, “It was lost in the library. Speaking of which, it’s strange. Our staff checked it the night before, but it disappeared when we woke up the next morning.” ”

“Can you show me the surveillance footage?”Lin Ze asked.

“”Yes.”Xia Shang nodded. “Mr. Lin, please follow me.” ”

Lin Ze followed Xia Shang and walked towards the surveillance room.

“Xia Shang continued, “Mr. Lin, look. These are all the surveillance footage from that night.” ”

“Can I make a copy?”Lin Ze asked.

“Of course!”Xia Shang nodded and personally helped Lin ze make a copy.

Lin Ze did not say much throughout the entire process.

“Although Lin Ze did not say anything, Xia Shang was very flustered. ”

“If he did not die in silence, he would explode in silence. ”

This Lin Ze was too terrifying.

“After copying the video, Lin Ze continued, “Bring me to the place where the books are placed.” ”

“”Okay, this way please.”Xia Shang immediately led the way. ”

“Because the Yuan dynasty recording was too precious, there were two or three cameras at the place where the book was placed. They were shooting from 365 degrees without any blind spots. ”

“But even under such circumstances, it was still lost. ”

Lin Ze frowned slightly. He subconsciously felt that it was not a simple matter.

Either there was a problem in the library.

“Or someone with incredible hacking skills had stolen the Yuan dynasty records without anyone noticing. Then, they erased the surveillance records. ”

Lin Ze walked around the library and followed him down the mountain. He felt a great pressure and had been secretly wiping his sweat.

“”Give me a copy of the borrowing records for the past week.”After thinking for a while, Lin ze continued, “It’ll take a month.” ”

“”Okay, I’ll get someone to get it right away.”Xia Shang immediately contacted his assistant to look for the book. ”

“Soon, his assistant found the book. ”

“Lin Ze looked at Xia Shang and continued, “You’re also a person who loves literature. You should know what this Yuan dynasty record means to me. So, I won’t accept any compensation. I just want you to find the book.” ”

“Xia Shang immediately said, “Don’t worry, Mr. Lin. I know how you’re feeling right now. There’s no need for you to say anything. We’ll do our best to find the book!” ”

They also wanted to find the book immediately.

“After all, if they really had to pay compensation, it would be quite a large sum of money. ”

“After Lin Ze went back, he looked through the list of borrowed books. ”

“Suddenly, he saw a familiar name at the back. ”

Bai Jingshu.

Was it the Bai Jingshu he knew?

“According to Ye Han, Bai Jingshu really liked to learn about Earth’s ancient culture. ”

Bai Jingshu was the last person to borrow the Yuan dynasty records.

“Although Lin Ze and Bai Jingshu had not known each other for a long time and did not get along, he could tell that Bai Jingshu was not that kind of person. ”

“Lin Ze put down the list, turned on his computer, hacked into the library’s system, checked the membership list, and opened Bai Jingshu’s information. ”

It was Bai Jingshu.

That’s right.

“Lin Ze frowned slightly. Then, he studied the surveillance video again and found that there was no trace of change. ”

The Yuan dynasty record seemed to have disappeared into thin air.

This was a little strange.

He now suspected that the thief had used high-tech means to steal the book.

“Moreover, this high-tech was definitely higher than Earth’s civilization. ”

“Currently, the only galaxies known to be superior to Earth’s civilization were the s and F galaxies. ”

Could it really be Bai Jingshu?

No.

It shouldn’t be.

Bai Jingshu was an absolutely open and aboveboard person. She wouldn’t do such a thing.
