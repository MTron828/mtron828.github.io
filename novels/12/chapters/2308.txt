Something happened to the old madam.

“Hearing this, Ye Shu’s heart skipped a beat. She immediately put down what she was doing and turned to look at the butler. “What happened to the old Madam?” ”

“The Butler looked at Ye Shu and didn’t know how to speak. He continued, “The old madam, the old madam didn’t seem to be breathing.” ”

“What!”Ye Shu’s face turned pale. “Did you make a mistake?”

Not Breathing?

How could she not be breathing!

She was clearly fine last night!

“The housekeeper explained, “In the morning, sister-in-law Wang went to knock on the old madam’s door. She knocked for a long time, but no one answered. Sister-in-law Wang opened the door and entered. Then, she saw the old madam lying on the bed. She thought that the old madam was sleeping too deeply, but when sister-in-law Wang reached out her hand, the old madam had already stopped breathing.” ”

“Ye Shu never expected that something would happen to Old Lady Lin. She calmed herself down and asked, “Have you contacted Doctor Jiang?” ”

Doctor Jiang was the doctor in charge of Old Lady Lin’s body. No one knew more about Old Lady Lin’s condition than he did.

The housekeeper nodded. “I’ve contacted him. Doctor Jiang will be here soon.”

“”Okay.”Ye Shu couldn’t care about anything else. As she walked out, she said, “By the way, Uncle Zhou, have you informed Jin City?” ”

Lin Jin city had gone to the office early in the morning and was not at home now.

“Since Old Lady Lin was in trouble and she was staying with Lin Jin city, she naturally had to inform Lin Jin city immediately about this matter. ”

“”I forgot in a moment of panic.”The butler continued, “I’ll go and inform Sir Now.” ”

“Yes! Tell him to come back immediately!”

“Ye Shu walked out a few steps and suddenly thought of something. She turned back and walked upstairs. She raised her voice and said, “Ah Ze! Ah Ze!” ”

“Hearing Ye Shu’s anxious voice, Lin Ze immediately opened the door. “Mom, what happened? !” ”

“Something happened to your grandmother! Hurry and Follow Me!”Ye Shu said.

“Hearing this, Lin Ze immediately followed ye Shu’s footsteps. He didn’t even have time to change into his pajamas. ”

“After all, Old Mrs. Lin was already old. She was in her 90s. The slightest problem could be fatal. ”

“”Where’s zhongruo?”Ye Shu continued, “Hasn’t he returned yet?” ”

“”Not yet,”Lin ze replied. ”

Ye zhongruo had gone to Mars last night and had not returned until now. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Lin Ze continued, “I’ll contact fifth brother.” ”

“Once he contacted Cen Shaoqing, he could contact ye Zhongruo. ”

“”Alright.”Ye Shu said, “Then contact Shaoqing and have Shaoqing tell Zhongruo to come back immediately.” ”

“After saying that, ye Shu added, “Ah Ze, you have to be mentally prepared. Your grandmother, she, she may not be able to make it.” ”

“Lin Ze was raised by Old Lady Lin. At times like this, the person who suffered the most was definitely Lin Ze. ”

“Although a lot of things happened in between, Old Lady Lin’s love for Lin Ze was real. ”

“Upon hearing this, Lin Ze’s face turned pale. “Grandmother ate a lot yesterday, why...” ”

Why couldn’t she make it today?

This news came too suddenly.

The scenes from yesterday still surfaced in Lin Ze’s mind.

Old Mrs. Lin had been holding Bai Jingshu’s hand and smiling so kindly. She still wanted to see her great-grandson being born with her own eyes...

“All the way back, Bai Jingshu had been telling Lin ze about old Mrs. Lin. ”

“In order not to ruin old Mrs. Lin’s image in Bai Jingshu’s heart, Lin Ze did not tell her about the past. ”

But today...

“Ye Shu patted Lin Ze on the shoulder, then, she said, “Ah Ze, I’m not too sure about the specific situation. Let’s go over and take a look first. Don’t think that the situation is too bad. Your grandmother was fine yesterday. It’s impossible for her to not be fine today.” ”

“Okay.”Lin Ze nodded.

The mother and son talked as they ran towards the north courtyard.

“Soon, they arrived at the north courtyard. ”

“The servants looked a little nervous. Seeing ye Shu and Lin Ze come over, Auntie Wang, who was usually responsible for taking care of Old Lady Lin, immediately came up to them. “Madam, you’re Here!” ”

“How is my mother?”Ye Shu asked.

“Auntie Wang shook her head. “It’s strange. Last night, I talked to old lady for a while. She even told me that we would go to Jinghu Park Tomorrow to take a look. Why today...”the last sentence.., it turned into a deep sigh, and her eyes were slightly red. ”

“Jinghu Park had not been visited yet, so why was the old lady gone? ”

Auntie Wang had been in the Lin family for less than two years. She had always thought that Old Lady Lin was a very kind old lady. She really could not bear to part with this old lady’s sudden departure.

“Of course, she was more concerned about her work. Her main task every day was to take care of Old Lady Lin. The Lin family was generous and gave her a lot every month. She did not want to lose this job. ”
