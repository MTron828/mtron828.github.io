“Yes.”Gu dening nodded.

Ye Zhuo took out his phone. “Let’s add on wechat.”

“Okay.”Gu dening also took out her phone. “Then I’ll scan you.”

“After adding on wechat, ye Zhuo continued, “Then I’ll go back first. I’ll go back and tidy up. Then I’ll send anything I need to your wechat.” ”

“”Okay, Miss Ye.” ”

“Ye Zhuo came to the ward and picked up his backpack. “Lizi, it’s getting late. Let’s go back.” ”

“An Lizi had just finished playing a game. “Oh, okay.” ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Where’s Pingting?” ”

“She went to the bathroom.”

“Just as he finished speaking, Zhao Pingting walked out of the bathroom. Ye Zhuo turned to look at Zhao Pingting, “Pingting, Lizi and I will go back first. Rest well and don’t think too much. I will come back tomorrow. Trust me, you will recover and be discharged in less than two months.” ”

“”Okay.”Zhao pingting nodded. “Zao Zao, I believe in You.” ”

Zhao Pingting really believed in ye Zao.

She knew that ye Zao was different from them.

They left the hospital.

“An lizi asked ye Zao, “Zao, are you really confident that you can cure Pingting’s illness?” ”

Ye Zao nodded.

An Lizi’s face was filled with disbelief. “F * ck! Really?”

“Do you think I’m Joking?”Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly.

An Lizi did not think that ye Zao was joking.

She thought that ye Zao was comforting Zhao Pingting so that she could rest in peace.

She did not expect ye Zao to be serious.

“”Zao Zao, you are too amazing! No Way! I will hug your thighs! While you are not famous yet, hurry up and sign some autographs for me. When the time comes, you will be famous! These autographs are the real works of famous people!” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Sure, no problem. I will sign a thousand copies for you first. If a thousand copies is not enough, I will sign two thousand copies.” ”

An Lizi was also overjoyed. “An autograph costs a thousand dollars. Two thousand copies is two million. Please Call Me a millionaire in the future!”

The two of them joked as they walked forward.

“Not long after, they reached the bus stop. ”

“Because their homes were in two different directions, they parted ways at the bus stop. ”

“An hour later, Ye Zao reached home. ”

“Just as he rang the doorbell, the door opened from inside. ”

“The one who opened the door was Whitey. “Beautiful Big Zao, Welcome Back! Would you like a glass of ice water?” ”

“I’d like a glass.”Ye Zao’s tone was indifferent.

“Whitey immediately handed over a glass of ice water, and then said, “Big Zao, someone just checked on you!” ” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“”Who is it?”Ye Zao drank a mouthful of ice water, his expression still the same. ”

“”It’s a very powerful system, but no matter how powerful it is, it’s not as powerful as me! I’m the most powerful in the entire universe! It actually wanted to attack me! It was immediately countered by me! It’s probably busy repairing itself right now!” ”

“Speaking up to this point, little white snickered. ”

“Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly, “You’re just a sweeping robot. Is it really good to be so perverted?” ”

“It’s all thanks to master’s good teaching.”

Ye Zhuo:”...”did something go wrong with this setting?

“However, the system that Xiao Bai mentioned should be Mu Yourong’s cheat system. ”

“She was currently busy with Zhao Pingting’s matters and did not have time to pay attention to Mu Yourong. She let Xiao Bai play with her first. After resolving Zhao Pingting’s matters, she would deal with Mu Yourong. ”

“After drinking the water, Ye Zhuo sent the treatment plan for lung cancer to Gu Dening. ”

Gu dening immediately received it.

“After receiving the documents, Gu Dening immediately went to prepare the things. ”

“Some things could be done by the team members, while some things had to be done by herself. ”

“Fortunately, Dean Zhou had informed her beforehand, so the people from the equipment and information departments did not make things difficult for her. ”

“Seeing that she was so busy and concerned about this matter, a colleague persuaded her, “Xiao Gu! Don’t be silly! This is impossible. Don’t get into trouble if you don’t get to eat pork.” ”

“Gu decing smiled and said, “Sister Li, I know you’re doing this for my own good, but I’ve already made up my mind. I Can’t give up Halfway.” ”

Sister Li Sighed and wanted to say something else.

“Su Zishan walked over from the opposite side. Her voice was filled with sarcasm, “Sister Li, since Xiao Gu has already made up his mind, don’t try to persuade him! Can’t you see? Xiao Gu is not turning back until he hits a wall! Doesn’t our medical world always stress on miracles? What if a miracle really happens this time?” ”

Miracle?

If there were really so many miracles.

Then a miracle is not a miracle.

Susan and Kudrin have never gotten along.
