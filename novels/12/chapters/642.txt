“In order to join the literary association, she had done a lot of homework.”

“This time, she would definitely not let Feng Qianhua down.”

“In the blink of an eye, the next day arrived.”

“At dawn, Old Mrs. Lin got up and began to choose her clothes.”

“At nine o’clock, Feng Qianhua came with Feng Xianxian.”

The mother and daughter were dressed very ceremoniously.

“At ten in the morning, Old Madam Lin brought everyone to the main hall where the guests were received, waiting for Master Yu to arrive.”

Very soon.

“Very soon, the housekeeper brought people over.”

The old man walking in front was dressed in a chinese-style tang suit. He had a long beard and his hair was already white. He looked like a celestial being.

This was master Yu himself.

Old Lady Lin immediately went up to greet him. “Jing Shan.”

Jing Shan was Master Yu’s name.

“Sister-in-law.”Master Yu cupped his hands. “It’s been many years. How have you been?”

“I’ve been well. How about you? How have you been all these years?”Old Lady Lin asked.

“I’ve been well too.”Master Yu nodded.

Lin Qingxuan followed behind to greet him. “Master Yu.”

“Master Yu looked at Lin Qingxuan and after a long while, he said, “This is fourth brother Qingxuan, right?””

“Yes.”Lin Qingxuan nodded.

“Old Lady Lin continued to introduce Master Yu. “Jingshan, this is Qianhua. You’ve met her before. This is Qianhua’s daughter Xianxian.””

Feng Qianhua immediately greeted Master Yu.

Feng Xianxian also greeted him.

“Okay.”Master Yu stroked his beard.

“Old Mrs. Lin continued, “It’s windy outside. Jingshan, let’s talk inside.””

Master Yu followed the old lady’s footsteps.

The group of people walked into the house.

“After entering the house, Master Yu and Old Mrs. Lin sat on the main armchair while the others sat on either side.”

“Old Lady Lin asked the servants to bring over the tea that had been brewed. “Jingshan, this is the first batch of Longjing tea before the rain today. How does it taste?””

“Master Yu picked up the cup and tasted it carefully. Then, he said, “First bitter, then sweet. The taste is mellow, and the fragrance is rich. The tea is clear and bright, without any impurities. The leaves are uniform in size. It’s a good tea! As expected of the first batch of Longjing tea before the rain!””

“Old Lady Lin was very happy to receive master Yu’s praise. She smiled and said, “This tea was brewed by Xianxian, which means that Xianxian has learned the way of tea very well.””

“Feng Xianxian said a little embarrassedly, “Grandma, you flatter me too much.””

“Old Lady Lin turned to look at master Yu and continued, “Jingshan, may I ask if you have any plans to take in a disciple in recent years?””

“Master Yu nodded. “Sister-in-law, to be honest, I have the same intention.””

The same intention?

Feng Qianhua and Feng Xianxian’s eyes lit up.

“Old Lady Lin continued, “Jingshan, what do you think of Xianxian? Although Xianxian is only 19 years old, she is extremely intelligent and has her own literary attainments.””

“Oh? Is That So?”Master Yu turned to look at Feng Xianxian. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Old Lady Lin continued, “Aunt Zhang, go and show Master Yu the calligraphy that Xianxian has written.””

“”Yes, Old Lady.””

“Not long after, Aunt Zhang came over with Feng Xianxian’s works.”

Feng Xianxian’s calligraphy was very beautiful.

“Horizontal, horizontal, vertical.”

She had once won first place in the calligraphy competition.

“Master Yu picked up the calligraphy and studied it carefully. Although there was appreciation on his face, there was no shock in his eyes.”

Actually...

His destination this time was not the capital.

It was Yunjing.

The matter originated from two calligraphy pieces given to him by an old friend.

“As a senior in the literary world, master Yu’s original works were almost priceless. He had once thought that his calligraphy was good enough, until he saw the two calligraphy pieces.”

“According to his old friend, the eldest son of the Bai family, Bai huaijin, had given the calligraphy to the master of the Bai family.”

“Because the master of the Bai family had something to ask of Master Yu’s old friend, he reluctantly gave the two calligraphies to master Yu’s old friend.”

“Master Yu’s old friend gave the two calligraphies to master Yu, who was good at calligraphy.”

“According to his old friend, the person who wrote the two calligraphies was a young girl. Bai Huaijin had also received the two calligraphies at a banquet, which aroused master Yu’s curiosity.”

He had originally thought that this calligraphy was written by a great calligrapher who hid his skills well.

He had not expected that the author was actually a young lady.

“The young lady had such high standards at such a young age. Master Yu really wanted to see for himself. If it was possible, master Yu even wanted to take her in as a disciple.”

“If he had not seen the two characters, Feng Xianxian’s calligraphy would have been acceptable.”
