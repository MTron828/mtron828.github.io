Translator: 549690339

“Yu Zifei, who was in front of the camera, was tall and handsome. He was taller than a reporter by a head. He did not look nervous when facing the camera, he only smiled and said, “First of all, I’m very grateful to miss ye for giving me such a chance. “Actually, when I decided to follow Miss Ye to Neptune, it was a very fortuitous opportunity. At that time, I had just broken up with my girlfriend. After I broke up with her, I felt that I should do something! “I can’t go on like this. In this life, I should go crazy for once. Since I’m frustrated in love, then I must be proud of my work! “Therefore, I decided to go to Neptune with Miss Ye and everyone else. Facts have proven that my decision was right. Miss Ye is worth it in this world!””

“In fact, when he first decided to board the aircraft carrier with Ye Zhuo, Yu Zifei did not even dare to tell his family.”

“That was because he was an only child. If he told his family, they would definitely not agree.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“In outer space, no one knew what would happen.”

“Once an accident happened, the family would not even be able to see the body.”

“In the previous scientific experiments, who knew how many accidents had happened.”

“It was not until later that the family saw Yu Zifei board the aircraft carrier with everyone in front of the television. Then, the aircraft carrier suddenly lost contact with the shop. Yu Zifei’s mother fainted several times. Fortunately, in the end.., yu Zifei returned safely.”

“The reporter was a smart person. He immediately discovered that there was news to be dug out from Yu Zifei. One had to know that this kind of news about a breakup could be dug out at the end, then, he said, “May I ask why your girlfriend broke up with you? Is It related to Miss Ye’s aircraft carrier plan? “I heard that before Miss Ye’s aircraft carrier plan, many people joined the Tang family’s laboratory. May I ask if your girlfriend also joined the Tang family’s laboratory?””

“At that time, no one believed that ye Zao’s aircraft carrier project would succeed. In addition, Ye Zao had also signed a bet agreement with the foreign side. For a time, everyone felt insecure and switched sides to join Tang Xue, who was on good terms with C nation.”

“Now, not only had the aircraft carrier project succeeded, but Yu Zifei had also become the first batch of humans to land on Neptune. For a time, he was in a glorious situation. At this moment.., yu Zifei’s girlfriend and the people who had defected to Tang Xue were so regretful that their intestines were turning green!”

“”I’m sorry,”Yu Zifei continued, “This is my personal privacy. It’s not convenient for me to reveal it.””

Yu Zifei was not the kind of person who liked to fuss over things.

“Since they had already broken up, it was already in the past!”

He did not need to make a big fuss about his and Zhang Panti’s past to attract the attention of others. This was meaningless to him.

“The reason why he had proposed to land on Neptune before breaking up was that he was afraid that someone would make a big deal out of it, saying that he was ungrateful and had landed on Neptune. After he had succeeded and made a name for himself, he had dumped his girlfriend.”

“The reporter smiled and said, “It’s fine! Then can you please answer the question. Why did you choose to join Miss Ye’s aircraft carrier project in the first place?””

“Yu Zifei said, “Although the speed of light sounds incredible, miracles are created by humans! Just like the people of the ancient society, they would never have thought that one day, their descendants would be able to invent a talking box. I believe in Miss Ye and also believe in Miracles!””

Yu Zifei’s conversation with the reporter continued. Zhang Pandi’s entire body was cold and her face was pale.

Was she dreaming?

Could it be...

Could it be that ye Zhuo’s aircraft carrier plan had really succeeded?

“How, how could this be possible!”

“Zhang Panti pressed the pause button and paused the television screen. Then, she took out her phone and was about to make a call when her best friend’s call came in, “Hello, Panti, do you know that Miss Ye’s aircraft carrier plan has succeeded? If I remember correctly, your family’s Yu Zifei is in Miss Ye’s aircraft carrier plan team, right?””

Her best friend only saw the aircraft carrier’s successful launch and landing on Neptune. She did not know that Yu Zifei and Zhang Pandy had already broken up.

“After all, before this, Zhang Pandy and Yu Zifei had already reached the point of discussing marriage.”

“Hearing this, Zhang Pandy’s face turned even paler.”

“Her best friend continued, “Pandy, is it or not?””

“After a long while, Zhang Pandy finally reacted. She stammered,”... Yes, yes.””

“Her best friend said enviously, “Pandi, congratulations! After so many years, you finally see Hope! I told you, Your Yu Zifei will definitely have great achievements in the future. You Didn’t believe me before! So What Now? I still have a good eye for people! I really envy you, Pandi!””
