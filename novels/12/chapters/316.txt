“Go get me another pair of scissors.”

“Okay.”

“So, Ye Zhuo ordered Cen Shaoqing for the whole morning. ”

“At 10:30, Ye Zhuo dissected the whole sheep. ”

He didn’t want the internal organs in his stomach.

“Including the sheep’s head, there was a total of 80 catties of mutton. ”

“At noon, Ye Zhuo planned to boil mutton vermicelli soup and then roast mutton chops! ”

“Since CEN Shaoqing was not a vegetarian, ye Zao planned to give him a mushroom sour and spicy powder. ”

It would be fine with a plate of cold cucumber.

“With this thought, ye Zao immediately took action. ”

“In a short while, the kitchen was filled with the aroma of grilled mutton. ”

Ye Zao tried a piece of grilled mutton chop.

The roast mutton chop was cooked just right.

“Crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. ”

“When he took a bite, the juice was overflowing. ”

It made him want to swallow his tongue as well.

As expected of a wild goat!

This taste!

It was simply too great!

Ye Zao narrowed his eyes in satisfaction.

Cen Shaoqing stood outside the glass door and raised his eyebrows slightly.

The taste of the lamb chop...

Was it that good?

“After the lamb chop was roasted, Ye Zao began to boil cen Shaoqing mushroom sour and spicy powder, and his own lamb vermicelli soup. ”

The mushroom soup and mutton soup were prepared in advance.

“At this time, he only needed to add some vermicelli to cook. ”

“Monks did not eat onions, ginger, and garlic. ”

“Therefore, ye Zao cut some coriander into it. ”

“”Fifth brother, it’s time to eat. Come over and serve.” ”

“Coming.”Cen Shaoqing hurried over.

“Ye Zao passed the mushroom hot and sour powder to Cen Shaoqing. “This is yours. Oh right, this cold cucumber is also yours.” ”

Cen Shaoqing reached out to take it.

The two of them went to the dining room to eat.

Cen Shaoqing did not expect that the seemingly light vermicelli soup would taste so good.

“In a short while, he finished a whole bowl of vermicelli soup. ”

“After eating, Cen Shaoqing took the initiative to wash the dishes. ”

There was no dishwasher in the kitchen.

He had to wash them by hand.

The Noble CEN fifth master stood in front of The Dishwasher for the first time in his life.

“CEN fifth master, who was famous in the business world and was a man of his word, was at a loss when faced with a pile of dishes. ”

What steps should he take before washing the dishes?

Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly.

“Ye Zhuo leaned against the door, holding an apple in his hand. He looked at CEN Shaoqing and said, “I think you should squeeze some detergent first.” ”

“The detergent was right beside him, so Cen Shaoqing squeezed a little. ”

“A faint light flashed in ye Zao’s eyes. “Then, I have to wear an apron.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing looked at the apron with KT cat printed on it, and the corner of his mouth twitched. “Are you really going to wear it?” ”

“Ye Zao hid a smile in his eyes, but the expression on his face was very serious. “Of course I’m going to wear it! Otherwise, what if the oil stains my clothes?” ”

The pink KT cat paired with the cold and abstinent CEO.

TSK TSK TSK.

That scene would definitely be beautiful.

“Seeing ye Zao so serious, even though Cen Shaoqing was very resistant, he still picked up the apron and tied it on his body stiffly. ”

“Ye Zao was afraid that he would regret it in the next second, so he quickly walked over to help. “Let me help you tie the apron.” ”

“In less than three seconds, he helped CEN Shaoqing put on the apron. ”

“Cen Shaoqing had a very big frame and a tall figure. When he wore such a cute apron, his entire style immediately changed. ”

It was very comical.

“Ye Zhuo held back his laughter and said seriously, “This apron is really too suitable for you. Don’t move. Let me take a photo of you.” ”

Cen Shaoqing:”...”why did he feel that ye Zhuo was holding back his laughter very hard?

Ye Zao took a few photos in a row.

Cen Shaoqing looked up at her. “Can I wash the dishes now?”

“Go ahead.”

Cen Shaoqing turned around to wash the dishes.

Ye Zao turned around and walked towards the living room.

“As soon as she walked into the living room, she could not help but burst out laughing. ”

Cen Shaoqing turned around. “What are you laughing at?”

“Ye Zao looked at the television and said, “I’m laughing at how silly the person on TV is!” ”

“As soon as he said that, his laughter became even more unbridled. ”

“Cen Shaoqing:”...”he suspected that ye Zhuo was implying something about him, but he had no evidence. ”

“After washing the dishes, Cen Shaoqing brought a plate of fruit over. ”

Peeled lychees and mangosteen.

Sliced pineapple.

And sweet watermelon. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Unknowingly, five days passed just like that. ”

“In these five days, the way ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing interacted with each other became more and more natural and less reserved. Just as Old Madam Cen had said, Ye Zhuo had now completely regarded Cen Shaoqing as a good sister. ”

The island was only so big.

“In the past five days, Ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing had visited almost every corner of the island. ”

Of course.

The small animals on the island had also been hoodwinked by her.

“On the first day, she took Cen Shaoqing to catch coconut crabs. ”

“On the second day, she instigated Cen Shaoqing to dig out the bird’s nest. ”
