Shi Qingcheng learned this from Old Lady Cen.

“Although she was a bit far from Old Lady Cen, Shi Qingcheng liked old lady cen very much. ”

“”Don’t worry, I don’t think I’ll let you have the chance to hit me,”ye Han said. ”

“Shi Qingcheng smiled and said, “You better remember what you told me today, or else I’ll make you suffer!” ”

The two of them chatted and laughed as they walked towards the kitchen.

“After listening to what Shi Qingcheng wanted to eat, ye Shu smiled and said, “It’s also a coincidence. This Morning, CEO Wang of the beneficiary group just sent over some seafood. Then, we’ll have half of the garlic and half of the steamed seafood tonight. Qingcheng, do you think it’s okay?” ”

“Shi Qingcheng immediately nodded. “It’s okay, no problem. Godmother, I can eat whatever I want.” ”

“Then it’s decided.”Ye Shu went to instruct the kitchen on how to handle the seafood.

“”Yes, thank you, godmother.”Shi Qingcheng said. ”

“”This child, why are you still saying thank you to godmother? You are not allowed to do this in the future.”Ye Shu also quite liked Shi Qingcheng. Sometimes, it was her honor to have such an goddaughter like her. ”

“Looking at Ye Shu’s back view, Shi Qingcheng Sighed. “Godmother is really good! No wonder burning is unwilling to go back. If I had such a family, I wouldn’t go back either.” ”

Shi Qingcheng had a stepmother.

“A stepmother couldn’t be said to be good to her, nor could it be said to be bad. ”

It was neither cold nor hot.

“If not, Shi Qingcheng wouldn’t have entered the military academy so early. ”

“You’ll have me in the future.”Ye Han hugged Shi Qingcheng tightly.

“At this moment, for some reason, Shi Qingcheng actually had the urge to cry. ”

It had been a long time since someone gave her such a sense of security.

“”Ye Xiaohan, will you fall in love with someone else in the future?”Shi Qingcheng continued to ask. ”

“”No,”ye Han said very seriously. “You’re the first, and also the last.” ”

Shi Qingcheng had already taken the first step towards him. He would take the remaining 99 steps.

“”Ye Xiaohan, if you fall in love with someone else in the future, you must not hide it from me. My heart can bear it very well, and I won’t Pester you endlessly. But the prerequisite is that you must tell me,”Shi Qingcheng looked at Ye Han, she said very seriously. ”

“Maybe it was because women in love were so worried about gains and losses, and Shi Qingcheng liked to think about such nonsense. ”

Or maybe it was because Shi Qingcheng heard a saying.

She heard people say that first love wouldn’t last long.

“Ye Han said, “It won’t. I will never fall in love with someone else.” ”

“”I don’t want your promise. I want you to promise me,”Shi Qingcheng said. ”

“Ye Han said helplessly, “Okay, I promise you.” ”

“After saying that, ye Han continued, “What About You?” ”

“What About Me?”Shi Qingcheng asked.

“Ye Han said, “You have to promise me too. If you meet someone better in the future and want to be with him, you have to tell me.” ”

“”I won’t fall in love with anyone else, not in this lifetime!”Shi Qingcheng blurted out. ”

“Ye Han smiled and said, “I want your answer, but it’s not a guarantee.” ”

“Shi Qingcheng continued, “Alright, I’ll definitely tell you.” ” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Lin Ze passed by and happened to hear the conversation between the two of them. His expression was a little complicated.

Could it be that people in love were all like this?

Saying such meaningless words.

“If he had not heard it with his own ears and seen it with his own eyes, he would definitely not believe that such a retarded conversation was said by Ye Han and Shi Qingcheng. ”

Lin Ze suddenly felt a little afraid of love.

“After all, Love would cause one’s IQ to plummet. ”

Time passed very quickly.

“In the blink of an eye, a week had passed. ”

“During this week, Bai Jingshu and Chen Yaosheng interacted more frequently. The two of them even added each other’s social chat accounts. ”

“Gradually, Bai Jingshu felt that she was starting to accept Chen Yaosheng. ”

“Chen Yaosheng would send her good morning and goodnight messages every day, and he would also chat with her about all kinds of interesting things about the dynasty. ”

Little did she know that Chen Yaosheng had learned these things on the spot.

Bai Mo invited Chen Yaosheng to meet her.

“How is it? How is the Progress?”

“Chen yaosheng smiled and said, “Thanks to Miss Bai, everything is going very smoothly. I can feel that Bai Jingshu is gradually getting closer to me.” ”

“”Congratulations, Mr. Chen,”Bai Mo said with a smile. ”

“”Thank you,”Chen Yaosheng continued, “Miss Bai invited me to meet you today. There should be something else, right?” ”

“As expected of Mr. Chen.”Bai Mo looked at Chen Yaosheng. “Nothing can be hidden from you.”

“Chen yaosheng continued, “If there is anything, Miss Bai, just say it. We are all on the same side. There is no need to be polite.” ”

“”Then I’ll say it directly.”Bai Mo did not hesitate and said generously, “Mr. Chen, I want to know the recent itinerary of Manwen.” ”

“If one wanted to conquer Manwen, one had to understand manwen, get close to Manwen, and create fate. ”

“But now that she did not know anything, how could she talk about strategy? ”

“Chen Yaosheng did have some friendship with Manwen, but he did not expect that Bai Mo had this idea. ”

“However, there was nothing wrong with that. ”

He was afraid that it would be abnormal if Bai Mo helped him for nothing.

“”Sure, I will send it to you when I go back.” ”

“”Thank you, Mr. Chen,”Bai Mo said. ”

“Chen Yaosheng waved his hand. “It’s no big deal. Miss Bai, you have helped me so much. I should thank you properly!” ”

“Bai Mo smiled and said, “It’s a pleasure to work with you. I wish Mr. Chen an early return with a beautiful woman.” ”

“”Thank you.”Chen yaosheng continued, “Miss Bai, based on your understanding of Bai Jingshu, when do you think is the best time for me to Confess My Love?” ”

“”Strike while the iron is hot.”Bai Mo narrowed her eyes. “Before Bai Jingshu can react, say what needs to be said and do what needs to be done. Even if she can react in the future, she will only be a fish in the sea.” ”

His last words were meaningful.

“Chen Yaosheng nodded and smiled. “Okay, I got it.” ”

“With Bai Mo’s words, Chen Yaosheng had a foundation in his heart. When he returned to Earth three days later, he began to prepare for his confession. ”

He arranged for Bai Jingshu to meet under an ancient building. The setting was especially romantic.

“Bai Jingshu did not expect Chen Yaosheng to suddenly make such a move. She stood rooted to the ground, not knowing how to react. ”

“Before she could react, Chen Yaosheng had already begun to confess, “Jingshu, you know my feelings. The fleeting moment three years ago made me fall deeply in love with you. It has to be you. I don’t know what kind of person you like, but I can work hard in the direction you like and try my best to become the person you like. Jingshu, be my girlfriend!” ”

Bai Jingshu did not know how she felt about Chen Yaosheng.

Their relationship began with a Yuan dynasty record.

“When she did not know that Chen Yaosheng was the owner of this Yuan dynasty record, she was very curious about the original owner behind the scenes. ”

“After meeting him, she was shocked! ”

“She never knew that Chen Yaosheng had such a side. Later, this shock turned into admiration. Later on, she admired Chen Yaosheng more and more. Now... ... She did not know what kind of feelings she had for Chen Yaosheng. ”

“However, the only thing she could be sure of was that she did not hate Chen Yaosheng, nor did she dislike being with him. ”

“Chen Yaosheng held the flowers in his hands and continued, “Jingshu, if you can’t accept me, I can promise you that I will never appear in front of you again.” ”

“Bai Jingshu could not confirm her feelings at that moment. She continued, “Can you let me think about it?” ”
