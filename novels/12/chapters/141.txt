Chapter 142: 084: Retribution for evil. Lin Ze has arrived in Yun Jing! 1

Upon hearing this.

Lin Xiaowei was immediately stunned. The little bit of sleepiness that she had left also disappeared completely at this moment.

“Officer, Officer,”Lin Xiaowei stuttered, “Our child’s father is a decent person and has never done anything illegal. There are so many people with the same name and surname in the world. You must have made a mistake!”

“Please rest assured, comrade.”The leading officer took a step forward. “We will not accuse a good man, and we will not let a bad man go! Where’s Ye Shuai? Let him out for a moment!”

“He, he is not at home!”Lin Xiaowei blocked the door and did not let the officer in. “You should leave quickly!”

The officer took out a plate from his pocket. “This is an arrest warrant. Please cooperate with the police and do not interfere with official business!”

Lin Xiaowei swallowed her saliva. Although she did not want to make way, she still took a few steps back honestly.

A few police officers entered one after another.

There was no one in the living room. Only a sixteen or seventeen-year-old teenager was sitting on the sofa eating a bun.

“Where’s handsome ye?”

The police officer turned to look at Lin Xiaowei.

Ye Fei stood up from the sofa and asked with a pale face, “What happened to my father?”

In his son’s heart, a father had always been a great existence like a mountain.

The police did not want ye Fei to see Ye Shuai’s sorry state after he was taken away. With a harmonious expression, they said, “Young man, this matter has nothing to do with you. Quickly go back to your room!”

Lin Xiaowei also reacted at this time and pushed ye Fei out. “Go to your grandparents’house. Your father is fine. Don’t worry.”

“Mom!”

“I’m Fine! I’m really fine!”Lin Xiaowei tried her best to calm herself down, she said in a relaxed tone, “The police uncle is here to talk to your dad about something. Go to your grandparents’house and ask them to come to our house for lunch! Mom will buy your Grandma’s favorite clams later.”

Hearing that, Ye Fei heaved a sigh of relief.

Looking at Ye Fei’s back.

With a bang, Lin Xiaowei closed the door and leaned her back against the door. Tears flowed down her cheeks.

It was not that she did not know about what ye Shuai had done.

What she did not expect was that retribution would come so quickly!

“Where’s Ye Shuai?”

The policeman in the house continued the topic from earlier.

Lin Xiaowei took a deep breath. She knew that she could not hide this time. “He’s in the bedroom.”

The police officer leading the group said to the police officer with a buzz cut, “Xiaoyin, bring Xiao Li and Xiao Sun in to take a look.”

“Okay.”Xiaoyin nodded.

The three police officers came to the bedroom.

As expected, Ye Shuai was lying on the bed, fast asleep. He only opened his sleepy eyes when the cold handcuffs were cuffed to him. “Wife, what are you doing?”

Ye Shuai was shocked when he saw that the person standing in front of him was not Lin Xiaowei but a police officer.

His body was covered in cold sweat.

“Police, police officer...”

“This is our police officer’s certificate and arrest warrant. Ye Shuai, come with us!”

“Officer comrade, I’m Innocent! I didn’t do anything! What right do you have to arrest me!”Ye Shuai struggled with all his might.

“Don’t move!”A few police officers held ye Shuai down tightly.

“Wife! Help me get a lawyer! Get the best lawyer!”

Lin Xiaowei nodded with tears in her eyes and sent ye Shuai to the door.

After the policemen took ye shuai away, Lin Xiaowei immediately went to ye Dafu’s place.

She was a woman.

Although her education level was a little high, in such a big event, it was impossible to not have a man by her side.

When Yao Cuifen heard that her favorite eldest son was taken away by the policemen, she was so anxious that she fainted.

“Mom!”

“Grandma!”

It was a chaotic scene again. Yao Cuifen finally woke up and started crying when she woke up. “Handsome son, my son! My Son! How can mom live like this...”

“Shut up!”Ye Dafu looked at Yao Cuifen and scolded her angrily.

The old couple had lived together for nearly forty years. This was the first time ye Dafu was angry at Yao Cuifen.

Yao Cuifen immediately stopped crying.

She was so scared that she didn’t dare to say a word.

Ye Dafu pointed at Yao Cuifen and scolded angrily, “You Old Woman, you only know how to Cry! Even if our Shuaizi is fine, he will definitely cry for you!”

Yao Cuifen sniffed. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Ye Dafu turned to look at Lin Xiaowei. “When Shuaizi left, did he say anything to you?”

Lin Xiaowei’s eyes were red as she said, “Shuaizi, Shuaizi asked me to hire a lawyer for him!”

“Lawyer?”Ye dafu frowned and continued, “Isn’t that Xiao Xuan a lawyer? Quickly call Xiao Xuan!”

It was easy to deal with someone at home!

With Lin Xuan around, Ye Shuaizi would definitely be fine.
