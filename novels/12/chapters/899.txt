The shuttlecock suddenly flew over and smashed into song Shiyu’s face. The atmosphere became strange in an instant.

Director Feng was scared silly.

He hurriedly raised his head to look at Song Shiyu.

He saw that song Shiyu’s left face was smashed with a glaring bruise.

It was over.

It was really over this time.

“Director Feng did not expect that not only did he hit song Shiyu, but he also injured him. ”

“Although song Shiyu had been staying in Yun Jing, who did not know the name of the head of the song family? ”

Everyone in the circle knew that the song family had killed their father when they were young. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Now, such a large shuttlecock had hit song Shiyu’s face. ”

Wasn’t this a move on the head of the Lord?

“At this moment, two figures ran over. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, we didn’t mean it!” ”

“Director Feng also reacted at this moment and smiled apologetically. “Director song, I’m really sorry! Sir, you have the magnanimity to not lower yourself to the level of these two little girls. I’ll send you to the hospital first...” ”

“Brother Song?”

“At this moment, Ye Zhuo recognized song Shiyu, who was dressed in a suit and leather shoes. ”

Brother Song?

Ye Zhuo was calling song Shiyu?

“Upon hearing this, song Chenyu narrowed his eyes slightly. ”

Ye Zhuo knew song Shiyu?

Were they very close?

“Song Shiyu was an eccentric person and never got along with others. His only good friend was Bai Jiayu, the successor of the Bai family. ”

“All these years, other than Bai Jiayu, no one could get close to Song Shiyu. ”

“Therefore, Ye Zhuo definitely wasn’t close to Song Shiyu. ”

She just wanted to get close to Song Shiyu.

What a pity.

Ye Zhuo miscalculated.

Song Shiyu was not someone easy to get close to.

Especially young and beautiful women.

“Not only did song Shiyu not like young and beautiful women, but he also had a sense of disgust for such women. ”

Very disgusted!

The only person of the opposite sex who could get close to song Shiyu was her sister.

She was a different existence to song Shiyu.

“If ye Zhuo wanted to use that face to attract song Shiyu’s attention, it was simply asking for humiliation! ”

Did she really think that the whole world would revolve around her because she was pretty?

She had no self-awareness!

Just wait.

Song Shiyu would definitely give ye zhuo a slap and ask him to apologize to her.

“After being slapped by song Shiyu in front of so many people, would ye Zao still have the face to stay in the program team in the future? ”

Thinking of this...

Song Chenyu’s eyes were filled with joy.

The anger that had accumulated in his heart over the past few days had disappeared completely.

“Three, two... ”

Song Chenyu counted down to three in her heart.

She knew song Shiyu too well.

“In three seconds, Song Shiyu would definitely be angry. ”

One!

“When he counted the last word, song Shiyu raised his eyes slightly, looked at Ye Zhuo, and raised his right hand. ”

Everything was within song Chenyu’s expectations.

Song Shiyu was about to give ye zhuo a slap.

“At this moment, Song Chenyu’s heart was in his throat. ”

“But at this moment, song Shiyu’s raised hand landed on his collar and loosened his tie. “Ye Zhuo? You’re here too?” ”

“Ye Zao nodded and continued, “I thought I was seeing things! By the way, is your face okay?” ”

“It’s fine.”Song Shiyu did not care at all.

Song Chenyu frowned without a trace.

She had thought that song Shiyu would give ye Zao a slap.

“After all, if song Shiyu could not control himself, even her sister could be ruthless, let alone an outsider like ye Zao. ”

Song Shiyu’s reaction was unexpected.

Song Chenyu didn’t expect song Shiyu to respond to Ye Zao.

Weren’t they not close?

Song Shiyu was never a person who liked women.

“Chen Siyan had waited for song Shiyu for ten years. She didn’t even ask for status, but Song Shiyu was indifferent. ”

Why would ye Zao Make Song Shiyu look at him differently?

“Song Chenyu furrowed his brows, puzzled. ”

“At this moment, Song Chenyu thought of Cen Shaoqing. ”

Could it be because of Cen Shaoqing?

“After all, Ye Zao was Cen Shaoqing’s girlfriend. ”

“For Cen Shaoqing’s sake, song Shiyu could not be blamed for being more polite to ye Zao. ”

Thinking of this.

Song Chenyu was depressed again.

“If it was not for that nosy old woman from the Cen family who insisted on forcing Cen Shaoqing to be with Ye Zao, what would have happened to Ye Zao Now? ”

Song Chenyu now deeply regretted that she did not curry favor with old Mrs. Cen back then.

“Back then, if she had coaxed old Mrs. Cen to be happy, would ye Zao still have the chance to ascend to the throne? ”

Why didn’t she think of Coaxing Old Mrs. Cen?

“She had clearly met Cen Shaoqing first, but ye Zao had taken advantage of her. ”

“No matter who it was, they probably wouldn’t be able to accept it! ”
