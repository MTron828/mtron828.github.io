“If it was a girl with a more cheerful personality, it would be fine. Some girls were especially shy. If the boy did not speak, she would not take the initiative to speak. ”

“Got it.”Ye Sen nodded.

“Ye Shu shook her head helplessly. “Me! One day, I will be angered to death by you!” ”

Ye Sen:”...”

On the other side.

At the base.

Professor Feng was once again urged by Jamila to send a text message.

“C country was waiting for the analysis report of the volcanic crystal to do an experiment, but Professor Feng and director Ma did not make any movements. ”

Looking at the text message from Jamila.

“Professor Feng frowned slightly, not knowing what to do. ”

“She had been looking for the analysis report of the volcanic crystal these days, but there was no trace of it. ”

“Just as Professor Feng was at a loss, someone knocked on the office door. ”

“”Come in,”professor Feng said after adjusting his expression. ”

“The next second, the door was pushed open, and director Ma walked in from outside. ”

“Professor Feng.”

“Seeing director Ma, Professor Feng stood up from his chair. ”

“Director ma closed the door. “You also received the message from Jamila, right?” ”

“Yes.”Professor Feng nodded. “What do we do now?”

“Director ma continued, “I just spoke to Jamila. He said that as long as we take out the volcanic crystal report, he will immediately help us with the immigration procedures.” ”

“As long as they completed the immigration procedures, they could go to the C country experimental base. ”

Director ma only wanted to study the aircraft carrier as soon as possible and board Europa. How could he still have the mood to stay here?

“Hearing this, professor Feng’s face showed a troubled expression. “But we don’t even know where the volcanic crystal analysis report is!” ”

“”There will be a way to find out,”director ma continued, “After taking the analysis report, we can go to country C to study the aircraft carrier and carry out the plan to board Europa. Therefore, professor Feng, we must cooperate well in this matter.” ”

“”I can cooperate with you. The problem now is that we don’t have any clues at all! We can’t continue to search aimlessly!”At this point, professor Feng paused and continued, “Do you think Miss Ye put away the analysis report personally?” ”

She had been searching for three days!

“Other than ye Zhuo’s office, she had searched everywhere else, but she could not find the analysis report! ”

Ye Zao’s office was not that easy to get into.

“Director ma said, “It shouldn’t be. Miss ye recently went to Yun Jing to accompany her classmates for the college entrance exam. She can not keep the volcanic crystal report on her all the time.” ”

“After that, director ma continued, “Moreover, at this stage, we still need the volcanic crystal report to connect with Yu Zifei and the others. Therefore, the Mars report must still be in the base, and it must be in the hands of someone.” ”

“Then where do you think Miss Ye will put the analysis report?”Professor Feng asked in return.

Director ma narrowed his eyes. “Among the few people that miss ye trusts the most.”

There were only a few people that ye Zhuo trusted the most.

“Jianghe, Huhai, the four brothers, as well as Tang Mi, Yu Zifei, and Xu Gong. ”

“Xu Gong and the others had gone to the C country base. Now, the remaining people were still Tang Mi, Yu Zifei, and the four brothers, Jianghe, Huhai. ”

But who had the volcano Crystal Report?

“Could it be Cen Jiang?”Professor Feng looked at director Ma.

“Director ma frowned. “It’s possible. After all, Cen Jiang is the one with the most leadership among the four brothers, river, Lake, and sea! If it’s really Cen Jiang, things will be a little troublesome.” ”

Cen Jiang was a rare smart person. It was not easy to be careless with Cen Jiang.

“Why don’t we do this?”Director ma seemed to have thought of something and whispered something into Professor Feng’s ear.

“Professor Feng nodded. “Okay, then we’ll do as you say.” ”

“Director ma continued, “Remember, don’t give yourself away!” ”

“”Okay, I know what to do.” ”

Professor Feng had been in the base for a long time and was respected by everyone. It should not be a problem for him to do this.

“”Then that’s all for now.”Director Ma stood up. “I’m going back to my office. If there’s anything, I’ll contact you on my phone.” ”

“Okay.”

“Two hours later, professor Feng arrived at Cen Jiang’s office with a test report. ”

“Professor Feng.”

“Professor Feng smiled and said, “Team leader Cen, are you busy?” ”

“”It’s alright.”Cen Jiang continued, “Is there anything that you need me for, Professor Feng?” ”

Professor Feng nodded. “It’s indeed a small matter.”

“Go ahead.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Professor Feng handed the test report to Cen Jiang. “Look at this.”
