“”Please rest assured, Dr. YC.”Mario continued, “I, Mario, will never regret doing things.” ”

He would only regret if he really listened to ye Zao’s words.

“The more ye Zao stopped him from researching, the more he felt that extraterrestrial life forms carried special energy. Ye Zao definitely wanted to take possession of this energy for himself and create the third greatest miracle in the world. ” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

This was simply the actions of a villain!

“Indeed, a villain had left China! ”

“Although ye Zao had already stood at the peak of the scientific research world, she still could not change the villain’s actions that were inherent in her bones. ”

“After saying this, Mario continued, “I am well aware of what Dr. YC means. To borrow a phrase from your country, we are all thousand-year-old foxes. There’s no need to play chat Zhai in front of each other.” ”

“The meaning of this sentence was already very clear, and it even carried a hint of provocation. ”

“However, Ye Zhuo was not angry, and he did not say much, “I have already brought the words to you. The slightest carelessness in the extraterrestrial life forms that have fallen from outer planets will bring about a disaster to humanity. As for whether or not to destroy them, the decision is entirely in your hands, Mr. Mario.” ”

“Fortunately, L continent was an island country. As long as they established a defensive line, it would not affect other countries. ”

“Mario smiled and said, “Please Rest assured, Dr. YC. If it really brings disaster to mankind, I, Mario, will take full responsibility!” ”

“”I’m just afraid that you won’t be able to bear it when the time comes.”Ye Zao’s tone was faint, but his voice was firm and powerful. ”

“Mario continued, “As for whether or not you can bear it, I won’t trouble Dr. YC to worry about it.” ”

“After saying that, Mario cut off the connection and cursed in a low voice, “What the hell!” ”

What a child!

“When he started his scientific research, there was no ye Zao on Earth! ”

What right did ye Zao have to criticize him in front of him today.

Just you wait!

“One day, he would be as dazzling as ye Zao. He wanted to let everyone in the world know of his great name, Mario. ”

Ye Zao immediately called an emergency meeting.

Mario did not agree to destroy the extraterrestrial life forms. The most important thing now was to contact the other countries to complete the defense work.

Ye Zao immediately contacted the leaders of the various countries’scientific research bases.

“After learning of this news, the International Scientific Research Department immediately issued a statement. ”

“For a moment, the topic of conversation exploded. ”

[ do any of you still remember the beautiful Europa Incident? ]

“At that time, country C insisted on landing on Europa, but they paid a heavy price in the end. ”

“If country C had listened to ye Zao’s words at that time, they would not have suffered such a huge loss. ”

“However, not only did country C not listen to Ye Zao’s words at that time, but when they landed on Europa, they even secretly rejoiced and even mocked ye Zao for being timid. ”

The current L continent was the country C that had insisted on doing it.

“[ I support Dr. YC. After all, this matter concerns the safety of all of humanity. ] ”

[ I support Dr. YC! ]

[ isn’t it just a few multicellular organisms? Is it as exaggerated as a disaster? Isn’t this a little alarmist? ]

“[ first of all, that is a type of organism that fell from outer space. None of us know what it will evolve into. Moreover, the international department also said that this single cell evolved into a multicellular organism in less than three days. What about three weeks later? ]? What about three months later? What about three years later? What’s the difference between this and raising a Tiger?” ”

“”The analysis above is very correct. The Europa incident back then became an irremediable situation because country C did not listen to Dr. YC’s face. Hurry up and wake up, lzhou! Don’t do something that you’ll regret!” ”

“Most importantly, country C, who had always been the happiest, did not make a sound on this matter. However, they had always been on the same side as China. ”

Mario looked at the words of the international department with a disdainful expression on his face.

“These stupid humans, just wait! One day, they would regret their actions on the Internet. ”

“At that time, he would let everyone know that no one from L continent could match up to them. ”

There was also C nation.

“He had thought that C nation would be different from other countries. After all, C nation had always had good taste. He had not expected C nation to be in cahoots with ye Zao this time. ”

“As expected, each generation was getting worse and worse! ”

“With country C being like this, how would they be able to stand up again? ”

It looked like they would have to depend on their continent in the future.

“Mario picked up the microphone and continued, “Speed up the progress of the experiment!” ”

He wanted to let everyone see the most effective results of the experiment in the shortest amount of time!

“”Mr. Mario, you... you should come over and take a look.”A flustered voice came from the other end of the microphone. ”
