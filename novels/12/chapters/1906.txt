Linda nodded and whispered a few words into Li Shuyi’s ear.

“After listening to Linda’s plan, Li Shuyi frowned slightly and said, “This, will this really work?”If it didn’t work, then she would be the one who would be embarrassed. ”

Li Shuyi was very nervous.

“”It will definitely work,”Linda said, “If you want to do something big, how can you not have some courage? I’ve already asked around. CEN fifth master and that ye Zao don’t sleep in the same room at all.” ”

What did not sleeping in the same room mean?

It meant that fifth master Cen did not like ye Zao at all.

He and ye Zao only had a superficial relationship.

Li Yueyue deliberately reversed black and white to make Li Shuyi retreat. Perhaps she wanted to do this.

What a pity.

Li Yueyue was still a little inexperienced.

Want to fight with her?

No Way!

“Really?”Li Shuyi asked.

“”Of course it’s true.”Linda continued, “In short, you have to seize this opportunity. I’ve prepared everything for you.” ”

Li Shuyi was still a little hesitant.

“At this moment, Li Erzhu walked in from outside the door. “Wealth and honor come from risks. I heard that Fifth Master CEN is leaving the Prairie Tomorrow Morning. If you miss this opportunity, you won’t have such a good opportunity in the future.” ”

“Hearing this, Li Shuyi immediately asked, “Dad, how did you know that they would be leaving tomorrow morning?” ”

“”Your uncle said so,”Li Erzhu said. ”

“Linda narrowed her eyes. “Shuyi, don’t think about it and follow my plan! If you miss this village, you won’t have this shop!” ”

Li Shuyi thought for a moment and then nodded.

“Seeing this, Linda smiled and said, “This is Mom’s good daughter.” ”

The Bonfire banquet on the grassland was very interesting.

Ye Zhuo held Cen Shaoqing’s hand and danced with everyone.

The red light reflected everyone’s smiling faces.

The crowd danced and sang in Tibetan.

“After listening to it a few times, ye Zhuo memorized the tune and lyrics and sang along with them. ”

“Her voice was unique, clear and melodious, like a clear spring. Ding Ding Dong, flowing through the forest. Although the voices were noisy, they could still be clearly distinguished. ”

“Cen Shaoqing looked at her from the side, his eyes filled with warmth. ”

“At this moment, ye Zhuo looked back slightly and met his gaze. “You should sing along too.” ”

“”I don’t know how,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“Ye Zhuo mocked, “How can you be so stupid!” ”

It was not until twelve o’clock that ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing went back to rest.

“After saying goodnight to each other, the two returned to their own room. ”

“As soon as they stepped into the room, Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly and sniffed lightly. ”

The smell was not right.

Someone had been in the room.

“At this moment, CEN Shaoqing’s gaze fell on the incense burner in front of the desk. ”

“If he had not guessed wrongly, the incense burning in the incense burner had an aphrodisiac component. ”

“Cen Shaoqing used the hand holding the Buddha bead to cover his nose, then turned his head to look in the direction of the bedroom. He took a few steps forward, entered the bathroom, and turned on the tap in the bathroom. ”

“Suddenly, the sound of water splashing could be heard from inside. ”

“Li Shuyi, who was in the bedroom, heard the sound and her heart raced. ”

“Thump, thump — ”

It was as if she could jump out of her chest at any time.

“Listening to the sound, Cen Shaoqing should have entered the bathroom. ”

It must be the effect of the incense outside.

“This kind of incense was specially used by the royal family of country C. as long as one smelled it lightly, it would make one unable to stop. ”

“As she thought about what she was going to say next, the corners of Li Shuyi’s lips curled up. ”

“Fang yinyue and Li Yueyue, this mother and daughter pair, had schemed and plotted against each other, but in the end, they were still defeated by her. ”

Cen Shaoqing came to the outside of the house. He composed himself and turned to look at his assistant. “Call the police.”

“It was a very simple word, but for some reason, it made his entire body tremble. ”

“The assistant was stunned. “Call, call the police?” ”

There had to be a reason to call the police!

“Cen Shaoqing looked around the room. “Someone is suspected of selling yin inside, do you understand?” ”

“The assistant nodded nervously. “I understand, I understand.” ”

Why would someone do such a thing in Cen Shaoqing’s room?

“But it was Cen Shaoqing’s order after all, so the assistant did not dare to ask too much. ”

“Although it was the prairie, the police arrived very quickly. ”

Sirens sounded everywhere.

“Because they were too loud, they immediately woke Li Sanzhu up. ”

“When Li Sanzhu and Fang yinyue arrived, Cen Shaoqing was standing at the door. He was tall and slender, holding a string of Buddhist beads in his hand. Although his posture was casual, he emitted a powerful aura. ”

“Li Sanzhu swallowed nervously and walked to Cen Shaoqing’s side. He asked carefully, “Fifth master, you, you called the police?” ”

“Seeing this, the assistant immediately walked to Li Sanzhu and told him the whole process. ”

“Hearing this, Li Sanzhu was also surprised. ”

He sold the Yin Girl into the wrong house?

How could it be!

“But Cen Shaoqing said this, so how could he dare to object! ”

“At this moment, two uniformed police officers rushed over. “May I ask who called the police?” ”

“Me.”The assistant raised his hand.

“Where is she?”The police officer asked.

“”She’s, she’s in the room,”the assistant answered. ”

The two police officers looked at each other and walked inside. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Hearing the footsteps outside, Li Shuyi was very excited and quickly took off her shirt. ”
