Chapter 38: Endearment

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Zhou Xiang married into the Cen family for over three decades, and she had an intimate relationship with Madam Cen like they were mother and daughter.

Upon hearing that, Zhou Xiang felt awful, and tears welled up in her eyes beyond her control. “Mom, you’re going to recover; you’re going to recover for sure!”

Madam Cen clutched Zhou Xiang’s hand tightly. “So, just let me give it a try, Xiang Xiang. What if I really can be cured?”

Seeing Madam Cen’s behavior, Zhou Xiang could not bear to reject her again, so she nodded and said, “Alright. Please take it for a few days and give it a try. However, we should agree in advance that if anything were to happen during the process, we should stop taking the medicine immediately.”

Madam Cen was as joyous as a three-year-old kid when Zhou Xiang finally nodded in agreement. “Don’t worry, Xiang Xiang. Ye Zi is amazing! She will certainly be able to cure me!”

“Who’s Ye Zi?” Zhou Xiang was stunned for a moment.

Granny Cen replied, “Ye Zi is my granddaughter-in-law!”

“The young maiden’s name is Ye Zi, huh?” Zhou Xiang clarified.

Madam Cen nodded.

When Doctor Lin found out that Madam Cen wanted to stop his treatment and take the useless medicine prescription, he was furious. One should know that he was a famous doctor in Yunjing Province!

Could it be that a famous doctor whose name was well known all over the country could not measure up to a nameless junior?

Was that old woman from the Cen family so old that she was demented?

Doctor Lin came to the villa where the Cen family lived on the same day and took away the medicine kit that he left with the Cen family.

Realizing the situation, the butler hastily informed Zhou Xiang. After all, Doctor Lin had always been in charge of treating Madam Cen’s illness since they came to Yunjing Province.

Upon hearing that, Zhou Xiang did not procrastinate as she hastily rushed over to the scene. “What are you doing, Doctor Lin? Why are you suddenly leaving?”

Doctor Lin carried the medicine kit in his hand. His brows were tightly furrowed, while his expression was extremely unpleasant. “I advised you about not seeking treatment from two different doctors for one illness. Since Madam Cen has already found a master to treat her illness, I won’t stand in the way!”

Zhou Xiang smiled and said, “Doctor Lin, where did that come from? Everyone knows that you’re the most famous doctor in Yunjing Province. We’re relying on you to cure my mom’s illness. Besides you, where else can we find a doctor who is brilliant and skilled?”

Who had no penchant for flattery? It was no exception even for a famous doctor like Doctor Lin. Upon hearing that, Doctor Lin’s expression calmed down a little.

“Yet, I heard that… Madam Cen has already stopped taking my prescribed medication.”

Zhou Xiang continued, “You’ve misunderstood, Doctor Lin. We’ve only stopped your treatment temporarily. It’s not that we don’t trust you but the person who provided the prescription to my mom is a junior member that she admired. It’s the junior member’s kind intention, so we can’t reject her as senior members, naturally. Don’t worry, Doctor Lin. Even if the treatment has been halted temporarily, we will still pay the consultation fees and medical costs during this period. Doctor Lin, just think of this as giving yourself a short break.”

Doctor Lin could still accept the first part of Zhou Xiang’s statement, but his expression immediately changed drastically when he heard the latter part of the statement. “Could it be that in your eyes, I’m that kind of vain person subjected to flattery?”

What was Zhou Xiang trying to imply here? Did she think that she could solve every problem with money?”

“Traditional Chinese medicine prioritized rapport. Since I don’t have a rapport with your mother-in-law, we should stop here. Certain matters can’t be forced!” Upon saying that, Doctor Lin turned around and walked away.

“Doctor Lin! We can figure this out together!” Zhou Xiang hastily caught up to Doctor Lin.

Doctor Lin stopped walking. “It’s fine for me to stay, but I stand by what I said. Do not seek treatment from two different doctors for one illness.”

Commissioning two doctors for one patient was a humiliation to doctors!

Suddenly, Madam Cen’s voice was heard coming from behind. “Since Doctor Lin wants to leave, just let him leave, Xiang Xiang.”

“Mom?” Zhou Xiang turned around.

Madam Cen raised her head to look toward Doctor Lin. “There’s the door; please help yourself, Doctor Lin.”

Upon hearing that, a cynical look emerged in Doctor Lin’s eyes. “Madam, it’s not that I’m bluffing; your headache is a symptom caused by coldness. In the medical field, the cold syndrome is an incurable, deadly symptom. It’s a coincidence that my first ancestor studied this syndrome in the past. Other than myself, even if you were to search through the entire China, let alone Yunjing Province, you won’t be able to find a second person capable of curing your headache! I believe that you understand this, or else your headache would have already been cured 20 years ago!”

Doctor Lin’s remark was both a reminder and a warning! After all, it really seemed that no one else could cure Madam Cen other than him.

Therefore, he refused to believe that Madam Cen would not beg him to stay after hearing what he said.

“Perhaps, Doctor Lin is unaware that however strong you are, there is always someone stronger, right?” Madam Cen’s voice sounded rather cold.

Doctor Lin turned his head to look toward Madam Cen. “Then, I hope that you will recover soon and live a long life, Madam Cen. I’m just going to be blunt here. If you were to regret this and wish to commission me again in the future, you would not have the chance to do so anymore.”

“Don’t worry; I’m an old woman who won’t ever regret my words and actions!”

“Alright, I shall remember that! I’d like to remind Madam Cen to remember your words today!” He refused to believe that anyone else could cure her cold other than him!

In less than a month, the old woman would regret this! By that time, it will be far too late!

The Cen family had just relocated to Yunjing Province, so Doctor Lin did not know too much about them. He thought that the Cen family was just an ordinary wealthy family. As a result, he made remarks that disregard others’ feelings.

After saying what he wanted to say, Doctor Lin turned around and left.

Zhou Xiang panicked, and she was about to go after Doctor Lin. However, Granny Cen held onto Zhou Xiang’s hand. “Don’t bother.”

Zhou Xiang heaved a sigh. “Mom, but your health….”

“I’m fine. I still have Ye Zi!” The old woman patted Zhou Xiang’s hand.

Zhou Xiang could only give up. However, she did not put any hope on Ye Zhuo’s prescription. In her mind, she was already planning to send someone to commission Doctor Lin again when Madam Cen had cooled down.

…

In a cafe, Mu Yourong sat at a table next to the window. She seemed to be waiting for someone as she was constantly looking out the window.

It did not take long before a young woman with a delicately made-up face walked toward her under the guidance of the waitress.

“Qingyue.” Mu Yourong greeted her with a smile.

“I’m sorry for being late.” Li Qingyue looked apologetic.

Mu Yourong said with a gentle voice, “It’s fine. We’re besties, so there’s no need to fuss about this. I ordered your favorite cappuccino and almond biscotti for you.”

Li Qingyue was just an orphaned girl living under someone else’s roof now, but five years later, Li Qingyue would dazzle everyone!

In Mu Yourong’s memories from her past life, Li Qingyue relied on her sole effort to eliminate the Yi family’s only son, Yi Tao. Afterward, she seized Yi Enterprises and turned it into hers. In fact, she had even acquired Li Enterprises, and in the end, she had even gained a steady foothold on an international scale!

As a result, Mu Yourong was figuring out a way to turn Li Qingyue into her ally at once after being reborn.

Earlier, Mu Yourong had made the first move to save Li Qingyue, and that was why Li Qingyue trusted Mu Yourong very much now.

They engaged in small talks for a while before Mu Yourong entered the main topic by saying, “So how are things at the Yi family? Do you still need more Annox?”

Li Qingyue hesitated for a moment before she talked about the incident where Ye Zhuo came to the Yi family’s home to treat Yi Tao’s illness. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Upon hearing that, Mu Yourong looked up in slight astonishment. “Ye Zhuo? Are you sure that you aren’t mistaken?”

‘Since when was Ye Zhuo skilled in medical practice? What the heck was going on? How could Ye Zhuo have changed so much?’ All sorts of thoughts ran through Mu Yourong’s mind at once.

Li Qingyue nodded. “I’m sure! That person was Ye Zhuo. Oh right, this is the prescription given by her. You can take a look if there’s anything wrong with it.” Even though Li Qingyue had already examined the prescription and found that there was utterly nothing wrong with it, she was still slightly concerned.

What if she missed something?

It was still better for her to be cautious in this matter.

Mu Yourong took the prescription and brought up the system to examine it.

After a while, Mu Yourong’s face cracked into a smile. “Don’t worry; this prescription won’t have any effect on the Annox Disease.” She knew that Li Qingyue was being overly concerned. How could a deadbeat be skilled in the art of healing, anyway?

Ye Zhuo was just the deadbeat of the Mu family in the past. Now that Ye Zhuo was back in the slums, she would still be unable to escape Mu Yourong’s control! She would remain as the bastard child of a mistress in this life!
