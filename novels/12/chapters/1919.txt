“Hearing this, Old Madam Li was stunned. ”

Because what Li Sanzhu said was indeed very reasonable.

“He was just a cattle breeder, but fifth master Cen was standing at the top of the pyramid. After a moment, old madam Li turned her head to look at Li Yueyue and continued, “I heard that Fifth Master Cen’s girlfriend is your classmate?” ”

“Yes.”Li Yueyue nodded.

“Old madam Li said, “Then you tell her. Between classmates, she has to give you face. If she doesn’t give you face, don’t contact her in the future!” ”

Li Yueyue was speechless!

How could she meet such a grandma.

“She had always thought that such a top-notch grandma only existed in novels. She didn’t expect to see it in real life today. Most importantly, it was her biological grandma! ”

“”Grandma, I can’t do it,”Li Yueyue continued, “Cousin is an adult. Since she is an adult, she should pay the price for what she has done.” ”

Old Mrs. Li was almost angered to death!

“How could she have such a son, daughter-in-law, and granddaughter! ”

God was blind. Such an unfilial descendant should have been struck to death by lightning long ago. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Shuyi is your biological cousin!”Old Lady Li looked at Li Yueyue.

“Li Sanzhu continued, “Mom, don’t make things difficult for Yueyue. This isn’t a problem that can be solved by her intercession.” ”

“”Then what can solve the problem?”Old Lady Li asked in return, “Like you guys, can you solve the problem just because it doesn’t concern you? The most important thing in life is to have a conscience! Shuyi is your biological niece! Biological niece! Can you bear to see her like this?” ”

Old Mrs. Li originally thought that Li Sanzhu would definitely listen to her when she came back personally. She did not expect that Li Sanzhu had changed!

He was no longer the obedient and sensible good son he used to be!

No wonder people said that one would forget their mother after marrying a wife.

Li Sanzhu was a good example.

“Li Sanzhu looked at Old Lady Li and continued, “You need to figure out who shuyi offended! That’s fifth CEN! Do you think this kind of thing can be solved with just a few words in front of Fifth Cen?” ”

“”I can see that your family is all cold-blooded animals! Fine, you’re not going to save them now, right? Then don’t call me your mother in the future, I’m your grandmother, I’m your mother-in-law!” ”

“After saying this, old madam Li turned around and left. ”

“At the same time, she silently counted three times in her heart. ”

“After three times, Li Sanzhu would definitely call her. ”

“She was Li Sanzhu’s biological mother, the head of the Li Family! ”

Could it be that Li Sanzhu wouldn’t recognize her?

Impossible!

“Three, two, one! ”

“After counting three times, there was no voice behind her urging her to stay. ”

What was going on?

Why didn’t Li Sanzhu stop her!

“Old Lady Li was a little flustered, but she didn’t show it on her face. ”

“Until Old Lady Li’s figure completely disappeared outside the door, Li Sanzhu still didn’t say anything. ”

Fang yinyue nudged Li Sanzhu with her elbow. “Your mother left.”

“”I saw it,”Li Sanzhu said. ”

“Aren’t you going to pull her back?”Fang yinyue asked.

“”There’s no need for that.”Li Sanzhu looked in the direction where Old Lady Li had disappeared. “Anyway, she doesn’t treat us as family.” ”

Li Sanzhu could see that his mother was extremely biased when things had developed to this point.

Old Lady Li could still help Li Shuyi even after she had done such a thing.

“If it was Li Yueyue today, Old Lady Li probably wouldn’t even take a glance at her! ”

“Fang yinyue smiled and said, “You said it yourself. It has nothing to do with me. Don’t tell others that I instigated you.” ”

“Li Sanzhu was a little speechless and said, “When have I ever said that!” ”

“”You didn’t say it, but someone did! In these years, aren’t there many people who spout nonsense?”Fang yinyue asked. ”

“Li Sanzhu sighed and put his arm around Fang yinyue’s shoulder. “Yinyue, you’ve been wronged all these years you’ve been married to me.” ”

Fang yinyue sighed. “As long as you know what’s going on.”

“Li Sanzhu tightened his arm and continued, “Do you believe it?” ”

“Believe what?”Fang yinyue asked.

“”Half an hour. As long as it’s half an hour, my mother will definitely come back,”Li Sanzhu said. ”

Li Sanzhu knew Old Lady Li too well.

Old Lady Li wished she could cut off a layer of oil from his body to subsidize Li Erzhu. How could she easily sever ties with their family.

It was impossible!

“Fang yinyue looked in the direction where Old Lady Li had disappeared. “I don’t think so. This time, she seems to be really angry.” ”
