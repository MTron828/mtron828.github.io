Chapter 174: 086: Prison for murder! A big shot in the business world! 2

Xia Xiaoman smiled and said, “Hello, Zhuozha Pingting. I’m an Lizi’s mother.”

“Hello, Aunty.”The two of them greeted politely.

Xia Xiaoman knew that their family’s matter this time was all thanks to ye Zhuoshi, so she sized up ye Zhuoshi a few more times.

Her eyes were filled with astonishment.

This little girl was not only good-looking, but also very calm. She did not have the impetuous temperament of her peers at all.

No wonder she handled things so well.

Even an adult like her would feel ashamed to stand in front of her.

Xia Xiaoman continued, “Blazing Pingting, don’t be restrained at Auntie’s place. It’s just like being at home. I still have something to do. Lizi, remember to take good care of blazing and Pingting.”

Xia Xiaoman knew that young people nowadays were different from their era. If she was at home, the children would definitely not be able to relax. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

An Lizi nodded. “I understand.”

After Xia Xiaoman left, Zhao pingting asked curiously, “Lizi, has your father and your mother already completed the divorce procedures?”

An Lizi said, “My mother went out today to ask a lawyer to handle this matter.”

“Then where is your father?”

......

An Lizi said, “He should be with that mistress of his. Ever since he fell out with my mother last time, he hasn’t returned! My mother plans to send the court summons directly to Liang Xinyi.”

Zhao pingting continued, “If he cries and repents, don’t be soft-hearted! As far as I know, even scumbags can act.”

“Don’t worry, he won’t.”An Lizi’s eyes were very firm.

However, from the moment an Dongliang hit her and her mother, an Lizi no longer had this father in her life.

An Dongliang did not go back for a few days. He wanted to give Xia Xiaoman a lesson.

He wanted Xia Xiaoman to feel a sense of crisis.

Xia Xiaoman loved him so much, she would definitely kneel down and beg him to go back!

However, what an Dongliang did not expect was that not only did he not get Xia Xiaoman, he even got a summons from the court.

Case: divorce dispute.

An Dongliang’s mind buzzed as he looked at the summons in his hand in disbelief.

Xia Xiaoman loved him so much, why would she divorce him!

However, this subpoena was not fake.

Most importantly, not only did Xia Xiaoman want to divorce him, she also wanted him to leave the house with nothing.

B * Tch!

She was too daring!

Everything in the An family belonged to him. He was the head of the family. Xia Xiaoman should be the one leaving the house with nothing!

An Dongliang immediately picked up his phone and called Xia Xiaoman.

He thought Xia Xiaoman would not pick up the call.

He did not expect Xia Xiaoman to pick up. “Hello.”

“Xia Xiaoman! You want to divorce me?”An Dongliang said angrily.

“Yes.”Xia Xiaoman’s voice was very calm.

“B * Tch! I will not divorce you! I will not go to the court either!”

“It’s up to you.”Xia Xiaoman continued, “However, if you don’t go, the court will automatically dissolve our marriage.”

After saying this, Xia Xiaoman hung up the phone.

Liang Xinyi walked over from the side. “Dongliang, your wife wants to divorce you?”

An Dongliang nodded.

Liang Xinyi’s eyes flashed. After waiting for so many years, she had finally waited until today.

In the future, she would be a rich lady.

“Then divorce her! Anyway, you have no feelings for her anymore!”Liang Xinyi hugged an dongliang. “I will always be by your side in the future, forever and ever.”

With Liang Xinyi’s words, an Dongliang felt much better. “Stay at home first, I’ll go back for a while.”

“What are you going back for?”

An dongliang said, “I’m going to chase Xia Xiaoman out! The supermarket belongs to our an family, that B * Tch Xia Xiaoman doesn’t deserve to stay in the supermarket anymore!”

“Then, I’ll go with you!”Liang Xinyi thought of something.

“I’ll go alone. It’s not appropriate for you to appear at a time like this. You can go to the supermarket after I divorce that B * Tch.”An Dongliang picked up his suit and walked out of the door.

He arrived at the An family supermarket.

An Dongliang realized that an unfamiliar man was sitting in the living room on the third floor.

“Who are you? Why are you sitting in our living room? Where’s Xia Xiaoman?”

This strange man was Wang Daqiang. “Xia Xiaoman has already transferred the supermarket to me.”

Transferred?

An Dongliang was furious and started to flip the table. “I’m the owner of this supermarket! I didn’t say transfer, who dares to transfer! I’m the real owner of this supermarket! Get lost! This is my home!”

Wang Daqiang did not fight with him and called the police directly. “Hello, 110? There’s someone breaking into a private house here!”
