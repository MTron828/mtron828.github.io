Translator: 549690339

“Hearing this, Li Yiyi raised her head to look at Bai Wei. “Are you that confident?” ”

Bai Wei puffed out her chest. “Because I have the capital to do so.”

“Bai Wei was very confident in herself. Because of her outstanding looks and good figure, it could be seen that ye Sen had been charmed by her. ”

“Judging from the current situation, it was only a matter of time before she confessed. ”

“Li Yiyi smiled and continued, “After you become rich, you can’t Forget Me.” ”

“”That’s a must.”Bai Wei held Li Yiyi’s arm. “Sister Yiyi, everything I have now is given to me by you. Of course, I Can’t Forget You!” ”

That’s right.

“From the moment Bai Wei first met Ye Sen, everything was a trap. ”

It was a trap set by Li Yiyi herself.

Li Yiyi was not willing to be abandoned by Ye Sen.

She and Ye Sen had been together for three whole years.

Why did ye Sen abandon her?

She was the lady boss of Shengdong Express Company!

Since ye Sen made her suffer!

Then she couldn’t let ye Sen suffer.

“After three years with Ye Sen, Li Yiyi Knew Ye Sen’s life habits. She knew what ye Sen liked and didn’t like, so it was easy for her to make ye Sen fall in love with someone. ”

“At this time, Li Yiyi thought of her little sister Bai Wei. ”

Bai Wei was beautiful and had a gentle temperament. It was easy to see that she was a good girl with good upbringing.

No man could resist such a woman.

“So, Li Yiyi found Bai Wei and planned everything herself. ”

Bai Wei’s name was not Bai Wei.

“Bai Wei’s real name was Li Lanxiang, and Bai Wei was the name she changed later. ”

She and Li Yiyi were from the same hometown.

Bai Wei wasn’t a dance teacher either. Her real job was the princess of the KTV nearby.

“Because of her good looks, she was very popular in the KTV, and there were countless admirers who came for her. ”

But the princess was just a princess after all.

“After those people had a one-night fling with her, they abandoned her one after another. ”

“Although those people were generous, and a single night was half a month’s salary for ordinary people, this industry was like eating the rice of youth. Once she turned yellow, there would be nothing left. ”

“Over the years, Bai Wei had gotten used to being extravagant. ”

“As the saying goes, it was easy to go from frugality to extravagance, but difficult to go from extravagance to frugality ”

“Once she lost her source of income, how would she live? ”

Bai Wei was already 30 years old this year.

“She was no longer as fresh and lovely as a 18-or 19-year-old girl, and her monthly income was more than half of what it used to be. ”

Bai Wei sensed the crisis.

She knew that she had to find a long-term backer.

Marry a rich man.

“However, as a princess, it was too difficult for her to marry a rich man among her past patrons. ”

Because those rich men looked down on this industry!

And no man could tolerate his woman having such an unbearable past.

They just wanted to play with her.

“But apart from those patrons,. ”

Bai Wei didn’t know any other rich people.

“Apart from KTV, she had no other way to meet rich people. ”

“After all, her circle was only so big. ”

There were ordinary men who pursued her.

But she didn’t care about those ordinary people at all.

“Could ordinary people buy her LV, Gucci, Chanel? ”

Could ordinary people let her live the life of a rich lady who didn’t have to worry about food and clothing?

“When Li Yiyi came to her door, Bai Wei knew that her chance had come! ”

She would definitely be able to hook up with a rich man like Yesen!

She would leap from a humble family to become a rich lady that everyone envied.

“Therefore, Bai Wei agreed to Li Yiyi without any hesitation and cooperated with Li Yiyi to put on a good show. ”

“Li Yiyi looked at Bai Wei and continued, “Lanxiang, it’s extremely cold at the top. Now is the critical moment. You must not let your guard down and let ye Sen discover anything! Otherwise, all my previous efforts will be wasted!” ”

“Bai Wei nodded, her eyes flashing with pride. “Sister Yiyi, don’t worry, I know.” ”

She had been out since she was sixteen and had experienced countless men.

Her acting skills had long reached the peak.

She was usually best at acting.

She knew what to do to attract the attention of men and what to do to make them worry about her.

“Moreover, she also knew ye Sen’s life habits. ”

“As long as Ye Sen’s habits became her habits,. ”

Ye Sen would definitely feel that there was a special affinity between them.

It had to be her.

The facts proved that.

Bai Wei was right.

“In just two short months, Ye Sen already felt that there was a special affinity between them. ”
