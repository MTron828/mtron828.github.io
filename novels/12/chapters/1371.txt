Zhou Zuolong turned sideways and invited Wu Youyu in.

“Seeing Wu Youyu, Zheng Wanyin, who was sitting at the side, thought she was hallucinating. ”

Why was Wu Youyu Here?

Or was she seeing things?

Zheng Wanyin raised her hand and rubbed her eyes. The scene before her eyes had not changed.

This was Wu Youyu.

Xie wanqiu and Wu Youyu were too bold.

“After doing such a shameful thing, they actually dared to appear in front of Zhou Zuolong. ”

“Moreover, the more Zheng Wanyin listened to the voice, the more she felt that something was wrong. ” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Wu Youyu actually claimed to be Xie Wanqiu’s savior.

He was really good at making things up.

“Most importantly, Zhou Zuolong actually believed it. ”

“In this world, was there anyone more stupid than Zhou Zuolong? ”

“Wu Youyu had given Zhou Zuolong such a big hat, but Zhou Zuolong and Wu Youyu were brothers. ”

No Wonder Zhou Xiang was also an idiot.

Zheng Wanyin’s eyes were filled with disdain.

“At this moment, Zhou Zuolong brought Wu Youyu to Zheng Wanyin’s side. “Come, yinyin, let me introduce you. This is your grandfather Wu. When your grandmother was young, your grandfather Wu even saved her! He was your grandmother’s Savior!” ”

“Zheng Wanyin stood up and said, “Hello, grandfather Wu.” ”

Wu Youyu nodded. “Okay.”

“In order to thank Wu Youyu, Zhou Zuolong even specially brought Wu Youyu out for a drink at noon. ”

“Both of them were good drinkers. In addition, Wu Youyu had saved Xie wanqiu. After a meal, Zhou Zuolong had completely let down his guard against Wu Youyu. They were even closer than blood brothers. ”

“Little did he know that in Wu Youyu’s eyes, he was just an idiot. ”

On the other side.

Zhou Xiang was running around anxiously at home.

Zhou Zuolong had only given her a three-day deadline.

“Once the three-day deadline was over, if there was still no news from her side, Zhou Zuolong would definitely not let the matter rest. ”

Could it be that he had really caused Cen Shaoqing and ye Zhuo to break up.

Zhou Xiang was so anxious that her mouth started to bubble.

“Old Mrs. Cen knew that something was wrong with Zhou Xiang and came over to ask with concern, “Xiang Xiang, what happened to you? What did your father say to you when he came over a few days ago?” ”

“”Nothing, Mom, don’t think too much about it.”Zhou Xiang comforted old Mrs. Cen. ”

She planned to personally go to the hospital and explain the matter to Zhou Zuolong.

“Seeing her like this, old Mrs. Cen did not ask further and continued, “Xiang Xiang, if there’s anything, you must tell me. We are all family.” ”

“”Yes, I know.”Zhou Xiang nodded. ”

In the afternoon.

Zhou Xiang arrived at the hospital.

“Seeing Zhou Xiang come over, Xie wanqiu changed from her usual self and became extremely kind. Meanwhile, Zhou Zuolong’s expression was extremely ugly. “Have you told your mother-in-law and Shaoqing about yinyin and Shaoqing?” ”

“Zhou Xiang shook her head. “Dad, I came here to tell you about this. It’s impossible for Shaoqing and Wanyin.” ”

Zhou Zuolong slammed the table and stood up. “Vile daughter! Say It again.”

“”No matter how many times I say it, I will still give the same answer,”Zhou Xiang said. “Dad, don’t you think that this request is too much?” ”

Too Much?

“Zhou Xiang actually said that he, as a father, was too much? ”

This was simply going against the heavens!

Zhou Zuolong could not help but raise his hand and give Zhou Xiang a slap.

Xie wanqiu sucked in a breath of cold air. “Old Man!”

Even Zheng Wanyin was shocked.

No one expected Zhou Zuolong to make a move.

Zhou Xiang’s head was hit so hard that blood seeped out from the corner of her mouth.

“Zhou zuolong continued, “Let me tell you, Shaoqing is my eldest grandson. His marriage must be decided by me!” ”
