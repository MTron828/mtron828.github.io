“Lin Qingxuan nodded. “At our mother’s age, it can already be considered a funeral. Don’t be too sad.” ”

“Okay.”

“After saying that, Lin Qingxuan continued, “Have eldest brother, second brother, and third brother been notified? When will they arrive?” ”

“Lin Jincheng said, “They’ve already been notified. They’re taking the nearest flight over. They’ll be back in about two to three hours.” ”

“Lin Qingxuan asked, “Have you prepared the paper money firecrackers?” ”

“Lin Jincheng said, “The Butler has already prepared them. The money for the journey will be burned after the eldest brother, second brother, and third brother return.” ”

“The custom in the capital was to burn the money immediately after the person left. The money had to be burned by the children of the attendants. Otherwise, the deceased elderly would not be able to receive it, and the road to the underworld would not be stable. ”

“After burning the money, the children could issue an obituary to their relatives and friends. After that, they would rest at home for three days before being sent to the crematorium. Their relatives and friends would send them off for the final journey. ”

“Okay.”Lin Qingxuan nodded. “It’s fine as long as you’ve made the arrangements.” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

There were no major matters other than life and death.

“Although Lin Jincheng had already made the arrangements for the situation, there were still many trivial matters that needed to be dealt with. Naturally, Lin Qingxuan could not be idle. ”

“Xia Xiaoman hugged the child and chatted with Ye Shu. “Ah Shu, tell me about this person. It’s really like a dream. This old lady was fine yesterday, but she doesn’t know anything today.”Speaking of this.., xia Xiaoman also sighed endlessly. ”

“Life was like a dream, a dream like life. ”

“”Actually, life is just a matter of closing and opening one’s eyes.”Ye Shu sighed lightly. She raised her head to look at Xia Xiaoman and asked, “Fourth sister-in-law, do you still hate her?” ”

“Hearing this, Xia Xiaoman’s expression was unclear, she looked at ye Shu and said, “It’s fake to say that you don’t hate her. You should know how she treated me back then, but she’s already gone. Let bygones be bygones. After all, she’s Qingxuan’s mother, ah Zhi’s grandmother.” ”

There was no need for her to argue with someone who had already left.

“You’re right.”Ye Shu looked into the distance. “Let bygones be bygones.”

“”What About You?”Xia Xiaoman continued, “She hurt you more than I did. Do you still hate her?” ”

“”I’m the same as you,”ye Shu replied. ”

“Xia Xiaoman reached out and hugged ye Shu. “Actually, you’re the one who had it the hardest.” ”

“Ye Shu said, “Fourth brother had it hard too.” ”

Lin Qingxuan had felt guilty towards Zhao shuning for most of his life and had controlled him for most of his life.

“Xia Xiaoman nodded, “This old lady is really not a simple character.”Her five sons were all famous big shots. Although she was a little pretentious, she had her ways, otherwise, she would not have raised her children so well. ”

“Not long after, the other three brothers of the Lin family arrived. ”

They had traveled a long way.

“Now that everyone had arrived, the next step was to discuss the future generations of Old Lady Lin. The brothers and brothers of the Lin family were all important figures, and their children and grandchildren were not bad either. Old Lady Lin was also very happy and mournful, so the funeral naturally could not be too simplified. ”

Old Lady Lin had five sons.

“She had fourteen grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. The whole family was young and old, and including the daughter-in-law and granddaughter-in-law, when all the brothers of the Lin family gathered, there would be a total of more than forty people. If it was not for the Lin family manor being so big.., it really couldn’t accommodate so many people. ”

Children didn’t know what life and death was. A few children gathered together and played around.

“Lin Yang, the grandson of the Lin family’s eldest, Lin Qingfan, was two years old this year. His understanding of life and death was even more vague. ”

“Lin Yang looked at Old Lady Lin who was lying in the ice coffin and looked at Wu Mei curiously. “Grandma, do you have to lie there even if you die?” ”

“Yes.”Wu Mei nodded.

“Lin Yang continued, “Will great-grandma come back in the future?” ”

“”No,”Wu Mei answered. ”

“Lin Yang frowned slightly and asked, “Why not? I want great-grandma to come back.” ”

“Wu Mei explained, “People will grow old and die. Your GREAT-GRANDMA has already left and will never come back.” ”

“Then where will she go?”Lin Yang continued to ask.

“Wu Mei said, “To heaven.” ”

“Heaven?”Lin Yang’s eyes lit up.

“Yes.”Wu Mei nodded.

“Lin Yang continued, “I saw Heaven in the cartoons. It was so fun! Grandma, I want to die too and see what heaven looks like!” ”

“As soon as he said this, Wu Mei immediately reached out and covered Lin Yang’s mouth. “My little ancestor, you can’t say such things! Children’s words are Fearless!” ”

“”Why? Grandma, do you mean you can go to Heaven after you die? I want to go to Heaven Too!”Lin Yang said. ”
