This kind of pain directly made Lin Sha lose consciousness and fall into a coma.

The phone also fell to the ground.

“At this time, the ringtone of the phone came from the air. ”

“It rang for a long time, but Lin Sha did not pick up. ”

Over here.

“Zou Feifei looked at the phone that had not been picked up, and the corner of his mouth slowly curved up. ”

“According to the drug’s effects, it should be acting up now. ”

“Ye Zao had not returned yet, so Lin Sha was definitely going to miss the math exam. ”

“She had a perfect score of 150 in math. If Lin Sha missed the math exam, how could she become the top scorer in the college entrance exam? ”

“Even if ye Zao came back now and sent Lin Sha to the hospital in time, Lin Sha would still miss the exam! ”

“After all, there was only half an hour left before the exam. ”

“If she went to the hospital now, it would take at least two hours for her to regain consciousness. ”

Unless there was a godly doctor who could immediately make her better.

But would there be a godly doctor in this world?

Zou feifei smiled.

“After a moment, Zou Feifei put down his phone and decided to look for her. ”

“After all, she had lunch with Lin Shasha in the afternoon. If she went to the exam room alone in the afternoon, it would definitely arouse suspicion. ”

Zou Feifei came to the door of Lin Shasha’s room and rang the doorbell.

“After ringing for a long time, Lin Shasha did not open the door. ”

Zou Feifei’s face showed an anxious expression. He hurried to the front desk. “Hello!”

“”Hello, How can I Help You?” ”

“Zou feifei continued, “I have a classmate staying in Room 1603. Ten minutes ago, I called her but she didn’t pick up. Just now, I went to ring the doorbell but she didn’t answer. I’m worried that something might have happened to her. Can you send someone over to check?” ”

“Then can you check the passenger information with me? What’s her name?”

“Zou feifei said, “Her name is Lin Sha Sha, shuangmulin. She’s Sha Sha with the initials ‘grass’. Then her phone number is 138 * * * * * 6123.” ”

“Let’s check your information again. Which Room are you staying in? Please provide your ID card.”

Zou Feifei gave the room number and then handed the ID card to the front desk.

“After the front desk checked the id information without any problems, he continued, “Okay, then you can go and have a look with our housekeeping manager.” ”

“After all, this was not a small matter. ”

“Previously, there were many passengers who suddenly fainted in the bathroom due to their physical condition, resulting in sudden death. There were also some passengers who committed suicide by burning charcoal in their rooms due to depression. ”

“No matter what kind of accident it was, it was not a good thing for the hotel! ”

Zou feifei nodded. “Okay.”

The receptionist started to contact the manager of the Customer Service Department.

“Very soon, the manager of the housekeeping department arrived. “Hello, Miss Lin, right? My surname is Zhu, and I’m the manager of the Housekeeping Department.” ”

“Zou feifei said anxiously, “Manager Zhu, let’s hurry over and take a look! I’m taking the college entrance exam at three in the afternoon, and I’m running out of time.” ” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Okay.”The housekeeping manager nodded.

“Just as the two of them walked to the elevator, they saw a familiar figure. ”

It was ye Zhuo.

“Zou feifei narrowed her eyes. There was a glimmer in her eyes. Then, she quickly walked over. “Miss Ye, you’re back!” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Zou feifei continued, “I’m going to look for Sha Sha with this manager Zhu. Since you’re back, I Won’t go with you. It’s getting late. I have to prepare to go to the exam venue.” ”

“Did something happen?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“Zou feifei said, “It’s like this. Just now, I contacted Sha Sha, but she didn’t pick up the phone. I went to her room to look for her, but she didn’t open the door! “I was worried that something might have happened to her, so I went to the front desk of the hotel to take a look!” ”

Ye Zhuo frowned without leaving a trace.

“The room manager opened his mouth at the right time, “Hello, my surname is Zhu. You’re the guest who lives with Miss Lin. Miss Ye, is it?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded.

“At this moment, the elevator door opened. ”

“Zou feifei said, “Miss Ye, I’ll leave First! If You Find Shasha, send me a message.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo and the housekeeping manager walked into the elevator.

“Soon, the elevator reached the 16th floor. ”

Ye Zhuo took out the room card and opened the door.

The first step was the living room.

“”Sister Shasha,”ye Zhuo called out, but no one answered. ”

“Ye Zhuo felt that something was wrong. Sure enough, after taking a few steps inside, he saw that Lin Shasha was unconscious on the ground. ”

“Oh my God!”The housekeeping manager was shocked.

“Ye Zhuo walked over and took Lin Shasha’s pulse, frowning. ”
