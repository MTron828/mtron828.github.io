“Searing.”Cen Shaoqing walked forward. “Don’t listen to Grandma’s nonsense.”

Ye searing looked back slightly. “What nonsense?”

Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads and opened his thin lips. “The board of Immortals doesn’t mean that fairies fly all over the sky.”

“As he finished speaking, Cen Shaoqing turned to look at Old Madam Cen. “Grandma, aren’t you afraid that searing will make a fool out of herself?” ”

“What if ye Zao came to praise someone and said, “You’re an immortal board...”. ”

That scene was simply unimaginable!

Old Madam Cen was a little embarrassed and scratched her head. “I really didn’t think of that.”

“Ye Zao asked in puzzlement, “Then what does the immortal board mean?” ”

“CEN Shaoqing said, “Search it on Baidu.” ”

Ye Zao took out his phone and searched for the meaning of the immortal board.

“At this moment, Cen Shaoqing’s phone rang. “Hello.” ”

“It was unknown what was said on the other end, but Cen Shaoqing continued, “Wait for me to come over.” ”

“After hanging up the phone, Cen Shaoqing turned to look at Ye Zhuo. “Zhuozhuo, I have something to do at the office.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “You can go back to your work.”

In the car.

“Little Tian Shun was sitting in his seat. He raised his head to look at the third aunt beside him. “Ancestor, why are you crying?” ”

“The third aunt hugged little tian shun and sobbed, “Tian Shun, your zu Zu’s family are all good people. When you grow up, you can’t forget them.” ”

The third aunt had experienced too many joys and sorrows in her life.

“After her grandson and granddaughter-in-law passed away, all her relatives became strangers. Only Old Granny Cen did not dislike them. ”

It was old Mrs. Cen’s acceptance that let her know that there was still warmth in this world.

“During the darkest times, the third aunt even thought of bringing little Tian Shun with her. ”

“Little Tian Shun nodded and looked at the third aunt. With a firm gaze, he said, “Ancestor, don’t worry. When I grow up, I will definitely be filial to you and that ancestor. I will also buy a lot of delicious food for uncle and pretty aunt!” ”

“”Good Boy.”The third aunt patted little Tian Shun’s head. “As human beings, we can have nothing, but we can not lose our conscience!” ”

“Okay.”Little Tian Shun nodded.

“The third aunt continued, “You have to remember that if it weren’t for your ancestor’s family, there wouldn’t be the two of us now.” ”

Old Mrs. Cen stood at the door for a long time until the car completely disappeared in front of them. Only then did she walk into the house with Ye Zhuo.

“The two of them chatted as they walked. “Yezi, did you go to the Zhao family and see that mistress?” ”

Ye Zhuo was stunned. “Which mistress?” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“The mistress of Zhao Jiadong.”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “I saw her.”

“Old Mrs. Cen was a little angry. She continued, “If I had known that your aunt would actually allow that vixen to enter the house, you and Shaoqing shouldn’t have gone over to pay new year’s greetings!” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen originally thought that Zhao Jiadong was just fooling around with that person outside. After all, du Yingying was a benefactor to the Zhao family. ”

She did not expect that Zhao Jiadong would actually bring that person outside back!

This was simply too much.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “The heavens are watching. Don’t be anxious. Zeng Qiuwen will get her retribution sooner or later.” ”

“At this moment, the deputy butler jogged in from outside. “Old Madam, Old Madam!” ”

“What’s Wrong?”Old Lady Cen looked at the deputy housekeeper.

“The deputy housekeeper continued, “Old lady, there’s someone claiming to be your sister outside the door, but I’ve never seen her before.” ”

Sister?

Old Lady Cen was stunned.

“She only had two younger sisters. One was her cousin, Bai Shu, and the other was her biological sister, Bai Zhi. ”

But they all knew Bai Shu. Could it be...

The person who had come was Bai Zhi?

“Thinking of this, Old Mrs. Cen immediately turned to look at the deputy butler. “Did she say what her surname was?” ”

“”Her surname is Bai,”the deputy Butler said. ”

Could it be that the person was really Bai Zhi?

Thinking of this.

Old Mrs. Cen was very excited. “Let’s Go! Quick! Follow me to take a look!”

“Because she was too excited, old Mrs. Cen stumbled and almost fell. ”

“Ye Zao quickly held her up. “Grandma Cen, please slow down.” ”

“”It’s okay, it’s okay.”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Yezi, let’s walk faster!” ”

“The two of them walked out of the door, got into the car, and arrived at the entrance of the manor. ”

“Before they got out of the car, old Mrs. Cen saw two figures standing in the distance. ”

“”Is it that one? Zao Zao, my eyes aren’t working. Quickly help me take a look. Is it that one? are those two your aunt and your uncle-in-law?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao smiled. “Those are your aunt and uncle-in-law.”

“”Stupid girl! Why does this stupid girl seem to be so much shorter...”after saying that, old Mrs. Cen urged the driver again. “Xiao Cui, drive faster!” ”
