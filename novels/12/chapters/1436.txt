“Shen Linlin frowned, “I’ve been in the base longer than you. Master Five isn’t someone who is easily threatened! Moreover, no man would like to be threatened! Sun Yu, don’t be so impulsive. I think the matter between Professor Yue and Miss Ye might not be Miss Ye’s fault!” ”

Professor Yue himself was not an easy person to deal with.

“Shen Linlin had worked under ye Zao before, so she had some understanding of ye Zao. ”

Ye Zao was not the kind of person who could not differentiate between right and wrong.

“Hearing this, Sun Yu looked at Shen Linlin in disbelief, “If it’s not ye Zao’s fault, then whose fault do you think it is? “That’s right, professor Yue did give Cen Jiang a slap, but what right does ye Zao have to give Miss Tang two slaps? She wasn’t hitting Miss Tang, she was hitting Professor Yue! Linlin, you’re my girlfriend, how can you turn your back on others?” ”

“Under normal circumstances, other than this kind of thing, his girlfriend would always be on the same side with him. ”

“But Shen Linlin, on the other hand, was scolding professor Yue! ”

“Shen Linlin continued, “Sun Yu, I didn’t come to look for you to argue with you!” ”

“Then what are you here for?”Sun Yu had tolerated Shen Linlin for a long time.

“Just because Shen Linlin held a higher position than him in the base, her seniority was higher than his, and her salary was higher than his, he had to tolerate Shen Linlin in everything. ”

“But now, he really couldn’t stand it anymore. ”

He was a human!

“Shen Linlin looked at Sun Yu. “Go back to work quickly, don’t mess around with them! Professor Yue brought them to strike, don’t mess around with them!” ”

“”Go Back?”Sun Yu laughed sarcastically, “Linlin, don’t tell me that in your eyes, I’m this kind of coward who cowered at the last minute? To tell you the truth, I was the one who proposed the strike! I was also the one who submitted the joint letter. This time, master five must bow to us!”Shen Linlin always felt that he was not capable enough, this time, he would do something big for Shen Linlin to see! ” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Let Shen Linlin know what a real man was!

“”What? You said that the strike was your idea?”Shen Linlin’s face was pale. “Sun Yu, do you know what you’re saying?” ”

“Sun Yu said, “I know what I’m saying, and I know what I’m doing! Linlin, just wait for me to get promoted and get rich!” ”

“Shen Linlin’s expression was very ugly, “Sun Yu!”! Are you crazy? It’s not too late to regret now! Hurry up and go back! Master Five is not in the office now, and I still have some friendship with Zhou Yue. Hurry up and get the joint letter back! Just pretend that nothing happened or else when master five gets angry, there won’t be any medicine for regret for you!” ”

“”Linlin, don’t worry! Nothing will happen! You women are just too timid!”Not only did Sun Yu not want to get the joint letter back, but she also hoped that Cen Shaoqing could see it soon. ”

“”Sun Yu!”Shen linlin continued, “It’s not easy to get close to the Cen family’s base! “Please don’t joke in your own name. I’m ordering you in the name of my girlfriend to quickly take back the joint letter! “Otherwise, let’s break up!” ”

“You’re threatening me with breaking up?”Sun Yu looked at Shen Linlin.

“”Are you going or not?”Shen Linlin tried her best to suppress her temper, “It’s impossible for master five to bring Miss Ye to apologize to Professor Yue! Your department is overestimating yourself too much! “Listen to me and quickly go back. Now that everyone in your department has left, only you are left. “When the time comes, master five will definitely put you in an important position!” ”

“”Let’s break up,”Sun Yu said. ”

He could finally see that Shen Linlin had looked down on him from the start.

“What?”Shen Linlin looked at Sun Yu in disbelief.

“Sun Yu continued, “I said, break up!” ”

“Shen Linlin nodded and held back her anger. “Fine! Break Up, right? Then break up! Whoever regrets it will be the grandson!” ”

Regret?

A mocking light flashed in Sun Yu’s eyes.

It was not certain who regretted it!

“When Cen Shaoqing was promoted to his official position, Shen Linlin would definitely regret it. ”

On the other side.

“After receiving Sun Yu’s joint letter, Zhou Yue immediately went to Cen Shaoqing and told him about professor Yue leading the members of the department to strike. “Master Five, this is the joint letter that Sun Yu asked me to give you.” ”

Cen Shaoqing held the Buddhist beads in his left hand and took the joint letter with his right hand. He did not even glance at it and directly threw it into the trash can at the side.

Trash should stay in the trash can.

“Seeing him like this, Zhou Yue was stunned. “You? What are you doing?” ”

Cen Shaoqing looked up slightly. “What did Miss ye say she wanted to eat?”

What did Miss Ye want to eat?

Could it be that now was the time to study what Miss Ye wanted to eat?
