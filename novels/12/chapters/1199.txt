“Chapter 1200: 257: a piece of trash, Zhao Xueyin was thrown out! The rightful heir of the consortium! 2”

Translator: 549690339

Zhao Xueyin searched the lawyer’s wechat.

His wechat profile picture and wechat name were still the same.

Linglong dice an Hongdou.

The profile picture was the lawyer’s favorite cartoon character.

“Seeing the lawyer’s wechat name, Zhao Xueyin heaved a sigh of relief. ”

She knew that the lawyer still loved her.

What was the next line of the exquisite dice?

Do you know the deep yearning.

Who Was this yearning for?

Of course it was her!

Zhao Xueyin clicked to add him as a friend.

She thought that the lawyer would agree soon.

However. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

After a few minutes.

There was still no news from the lawyer.

Ding!

“At this moment, Zhao Xueyin suddenly received a message. ”

It must be the lawyer!

Zhao Xueyin opened her phone to take a look.

It was a system message.

[ the other party has rejected your friend request. ]

Rejected.

Si Lu actually rejected it.

Zhao Xueyin’s face was filled with a mocking smile.

Ye Zao.

It was all ye Zao.

It must have been ye Zao who took advantage of the situation.

It was all ye Zao’s fault!

“If it wasn’t for ye Zao, she wouldn’t have become like this all of a sudden. ”

“Now, even the person who loved her the most had been snatched away by Ye Zao. ”

Zhao Xueyin’s face was full of malice. Her gaze was as if she wanted to eat someone. She fiercely hammered the steering wheel. “B * Tch! B * Tch! Why won’t B * Tch Die!”

The atmosphere in the carriage was stifling and oppressive.

After a long while.

Zhao Xueyin finally returned to the Zhao family in a daze.

Just as she stepped into the hall.

Bang!

A vase was smashed in front of Zhao Xueyin and shattered into pieces.

Zhao Xueyin was so scared that she took a step back. She raised her head and looked at Father Zhao who was standing in front of her. “Dad...”

“Father Zhao was full of anger as he said, “You’re a disgrace! You still have the face to come back! Why Don’t you die outside!” ”

Disgrace!

It was simply too shameful!

“”What About Me?”Zhao Xueyin’s mood was already very bad. When she returned home, not only did she not hear Father Zhao’s comforting words, but instead, she was scolded. “All these years! Other than scolding me, what else can you do?” ”

“Every time something happened, Father Zhao would immediately scold her. ”

Or he would blame her for not being a son.

He was not worthy of being a father at all!

“Look at what you’ve Done!”Father Zhao placed the phone in front of Zhao Xueyin.

Zhao Xueyin lowered her head and saw herself on the phone screen.

Her pupils dilated and her eyes were filled with disbelief.

This was the photo of her being thrown out of DK Jewelry Center.

There were five photos in total.

The title was very eye-catching:

[ explosive! The daughter of a famous financial group was thrown out of DK Jewelry Center! The reason is still unknown! ]

“The number of views of this news was very high. In just two hours, more than 100,000 people had already seen it. ”

The comments below were even more interesting.

[ it is said that the daughter of a certain financial group tried to seduce Master Five of DK. She failed and was thrown out! ]

[ What Financial Group? It is the Shunxi Financial Group! ]

[ Shunxi Financial Group? I think I know who it is! ]

[ seduce? Damn! This is too explosive! Even master five dared to seduce her! ]

[ I didn’t expect that the daughter of a financial group would do such a shameful thing. ]

[ seduction? Do you have any evidence? The keyboard warrior just opened his mouth? ]

“[ if it wasn’t seduction, how could she be thrown out? ] ”

“[ at the scene, what the person above said wasn’t wrong! Also, this financial group’s daughter’s surname is Zhao, and her name is ZXY. As for who she is, there’s no need to say more, right? ] ”

“[ I know, I know, I know! Previously, this young lady claimed to be the number one beauty in the financial world. Ever since the official heir of the Financial Group returned, she has nothing to do with it anymore! She probably wants to be promoted, that’s why she came up with this seduction. ] ”

Father Zhao was an extremely shameless person.

“Without a son, he was once unable to raise his head in the circle. ”

“Now, Zhao Xueyin had done such a shameful thing. How could the Zhao family raise their head in the circle in the future? ”

Zhao Xueyin panicked.

She really panicked.

“She did not expect that the photo would be posted on the Internet, and she did not expect the popularity to rise so quickly. ”

“”It’s not like that, it’s not like that!”Zhao Xueyin picked up her phone and smashed it hard on the ground. “It’s not like that! Dad, listen to me!” ”

“Do you think you’ll be fine just because you smashed your phone?”Father Zhao was so angry that his face was red. “How many people are laughing at our Zhao family now? Seducing master five! and being thrown out by someone! You’ve completely disgraced my old face!”

It was said that it was extremely cold at the top.

“Therefore, all these years, Father Zhao had always been careful with his words and actions, and did not leave any small traces for the outside world. ”

“In addition, Zhao Xueyin’s talent was not bad, and she was a model among socialites. ”
