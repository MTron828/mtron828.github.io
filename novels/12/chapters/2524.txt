“Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded.

“Elder bai continued, “Don’t worry too much. Ah Ze’s parents are kind people. They definitely won’t blame you.” ”

“Elder Bai paused. “Jingshu, you should be more careful in the future. Although they won’t argue with you, as a junior, you should know what to do.” ”

“Okay.”

“Elder bai asked again, “How are things with Ah Ze Now?” ”

He was still very worried about Bai Jingshu and Lin Ze’s relationship.

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “Grandfather, don’t worry. Ah Ze is very good to me. I have a bad temper sometimes, and it’s mostly because he gives in to me. Ah Ze is a good husband now, and he will be a good father in the future!” ”

“Although they had been married for more than a year, the two of them were still as if they were in a passionate relationship. ”

“It was inevitable that there would be occasional arguments, but these were all to increase the reconciliation of their relationship, making the relationship between the two of them better and better. ”

“”That’s good.”Old Master Bai continued, “Relationships are a matter between two people. Both of you have to tolerate and understand each other.” ”

“”Yes, I know.”Bai Jingshu nodded. ”

“Old Master Bai continued to ask, “Are the rest of the Lin family easy to get along with?” ”

“”They’re all very easy to get along with,”Bai Jingshu said. ”

“Old Master Bai looked at Bai Jingshu. “Jingshu, you’ve been used to reporting good news and not bad news since you were young. However, you can’t report good news and not bad news for such a major event in your life!” ”

“”Grandpa, what are you thinking about? Ah Ze’s family is really very good. You’ve met sister, and there are also some other people who are very warm to me,”Bai Jingshu said. “Grandpa, do you think I’m the kind of person who would suffer in silence?” ”

“That’s Good!”Old Master Bai nodded.

“After Bai Jingshu left, Old Master Bai contacted Lin Jincheng and Ye Shu. ”

“”Old Master, how have you been recently?”Lin Jincheng asked. ”

“Old Master Bai smiled and said, “Thank you for your concern, Father Ah Ze. I’m very well. It’s just that Jingshu has been causing trouble for the two of you at home!” ”

“Ye Shu continued, “Old Master, what are you talking about? We’re all family! “Jingshu is a very good child. We like her more than anything! “How can you say that it’s not troublesome? Don’t worry, Jingshu is in our house. We’ll treat her as our biological daughter!” ”

“”Okay.”Old Master Bai nodded, “Jingshu is lucky to have such sensible parents-in-law like you two. “However, this child isn’t sensible. She’s not even three months pregnant. She shouldn’t have come back with Ah Ze this time. It’s also because you two are magnanimous enough not to argue with her. If it were someone else, they would definitely lecture her.” ”

“After saying that, elder Bai continued, “Don’t worry, I’ve already lectured that child on behalf of the two of you. She definitely won’t do it again in the future.” ”

“”Elder Bai, your words are too serious.”Ye Shu smiled and said, “It’s a new era now. It’s not like before. The children can go wherever they want to go. It’s fine. You Don’t have to take it to heart.” ”

“”Although that’s what you said, we still have to abide by the rules. After all, there’s no circle without rules,”Old Master Bai said. ”

“Lin Jincheng continued to speak, “Old Master, it’s really nothing. We husband and wife didn’t take these things to heart. What rules or no rules? Rules are dead, and people are alive. As elders, what they want to see the most is that the younger generation is happy.” ”

“Elder bai smiled and said, “Both of you are reasonable people. Jingshu is lucky to have met two in-laws like you!” ”

“If it were anyone else, they might not have such a good temper. ”

Elder Bai chatted with Lin Jincheng and ye Shu about their parents before cutting off the video call. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“After cutting off the video call, elder Bai went to find Lin Ze. “Ah Ze, do you have time to chat with Grandpa?” ”

“Lin Ze nodded slightly. “Yes, Grandpa.” ”

“After saying that, Lin Ze followed elder Bai’s footsteps. ”

The two of them walked to the gazebo in the garden.

A servant brought some tea.

Elder Bai looked at Lin Ze. “Does ah ze drink black tea or jasmine tea?”

“Lin Ze said, “I’ll drink jasmine tea.” ”

Elder Bai nodded slightly and looked at the servant. “Pour some jasmine tea for Ah Ze.”

“Okay.”The maid brought some tea for Lin Ze.

Elder Bai waved his hand. “You can leave first.”

The maid bowed and turned to leave.

“Elder bai smiled and said, “This jasmine tea was brought by your parents last time. Jingshu is really blessed. Although her original family has problems, your Lin family really doesn’t have any objections to her.” ”
