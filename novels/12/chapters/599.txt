“Chapter 600: 144: face-smacking, glorious! 2”

Translator: 549690339

Seeing this scene.

The Lin family relatives below the stage were completely petrified.

Dr. YC!

Ye Zao was really Dr. YC!

Oh My God!

“Old Mrs. Lin just stood there in a daze on the chair. Looking at Ye Zao on the stage, her face was livid, and her breathing was difficult. Her eyes were filled with disbelief. ”

“Just a moment ago, she had despised ye Zao for embarrassing himself. But now, this embarrassing person had actually transformed into Dr. YC! ”

How Could Ye Zao be Dr. YC?

What was going on?

“She had taught Lin Ze so well, and Lin Ze had only gotten first place. ”

Ye Zao was actually a doctor!

Was she dreaming?

“Old Mrs. Lin’s heart was in a mess, and she felt very uncomfortable. ”

“However, Lin Jincheng added fuel to the fire. “Mom, do you still feel that Zao Zao is a disgrace now?” ”

“Old Mrs. Lin’s face was flushed red with shame. Her entire neck was red with shame. She pursed her lower lips and wanted to say something, but in the end, nothing came out of her mouth. ”

Then she looked at Feng Qianhua.

She also lost her composure.

“From the moment ye Zao walked onto the red carpet, she had felt that ye Zao was here to be humiliated. ”

But she had never expected that ye Zao would actually be the one in the limelight.

“One second ago, she was proud that Feng Qianxian was the only girl in the award. ”

“But in the blink of an eye,. ”

Ye Zao gave her a heavy slap.

“Compared to the Doctor Who presented the award,. ”

Third place was nothing?

“Moreover, this award was created by Dr. YC. ”

And now ye Zao was Dr. YC himself.

Didn’t this mean that Feng Qianxian received the award created by Ye Zao?

What was this?

“Feng Qianhua held back her anger. It was neither up nor down, and it was worse than being dead for a while. ”

She had always looked down on ye Zao.

She thought that ye Zao came from a small place and couldn’t make a name for himself.

But today...

It was this piece of trash that she had always looked down on that made her so embarrassed.

“However, the relatives of the Lin family were still lamenting that ye Zao was amazing. ”

“Little twelve is really amazing!”

“”In the future, our Lin family will also have a backer in the scientific and technological world.” ”

“Fifth sister-in-law taught the child really well!”

The person who had just been praised by them was still Feng Qianxian.

On the stage.

Miss Etiquette brought over the trophy and medal.

“The host said, “It’s been hard on the Doctor to present the awards to the three winners.” ”

“Ye Zao picked up the bronze medal and walked in front of Feng Qianxian. His expression remained the same. “Congratulations, student Feng.” ”

“Looking at ye Zao in front of her, Feng Qianxian felt like she was going crazy. It was as if all the strength in her body had been sucked out at that moment. ” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Her heart was in a mess.

She had thought that she would be able to make a name for herself today.

“She did not expect that first, it was Lin ze who took first place. ”

“Then, Ye Zao inexplicably became Doctor YC! ”

Doctor!

“In front of the title of doctor, her third place was just a joke! ”

Feng Xianxian felt a chill run down her spine as she bent down stiffly.

Ye Zhuo placed the bronze medal on her neck.

“”Thank, thank you doctor.” ”

Feng Xianxian said these five words with great difficulty.

Looking at the bronze medal on her chest.

She was not happy at all.

It was a great humiliation!

“To her, this was simply a great humiliation! ”

Ye Zhuo smiled slightly. “Student Feng has performed very well in this year’s science and technology competition. Continue to work hard in the future.”

Every word that ye Zao said turned into a resounding slap that landed directly on Feng Qianxian’s face.

Without Mercy.

On purpose.

Ye Zao must have done it on purpose.

She was deliberately humiliating her.

“You did it on Purpose?”Feng Qianxian gritted her teeth.

“Ye Zao smiled faintly and reached out to straighten Feng Qianxian’s collar. He leaned slightly and said in a low voice, “When you sit in my current position, you will have the right to judge whether I did it on purpose or not. The current you is still not qualified.” ”

“Feng Qianxian clenched her fists and recalled what she had said in the dormitory these past few days. Back then, she was so proud, but now, she was in a sorry state. The humiliation in her eyes was almost overflowing. ”

“Ye Zao patted Feng Qianxian’s shoulder. “Student Feng, you can do it. I believe in You!” ”

“In the eyes of others, this sentence was ye Zao’s encouragement and praise for Feng Qianxian. ”

“But in Feng Xianxian’s eyes, there was only sarcasm. ”

It was the greatest sarcasm!

“However, at this moment, Feng Xianxian did not have the slightest ability to fight back! ”

“Not only could she not fight back, she even had to bow and say thank you to Ye Zhuo. ”

“In the instant she bent over, the sinister look in Feng Xianxian’s eyes was about to overflow. ”

Wait!

“One day, she would take back the humiliation that ye Zhuo had given her today, with interest. ”

Ye Zao then gave the second prize.

The winner of the second prize was Chen Zhaomu.
