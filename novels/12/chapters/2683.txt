Ye Sui was really angry. She didn’t expect ye Shu to become like this.

“”If I knew you didn’t care about sisterhood, I wouldn’t have lent you the 300 yuan back then!”Ye Sui said angrily. ” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“”Didn’t I return the 300 Yuan back then?”Ye Shu turned her head slightly and continued, “If I remember correctly, I still returned it to you with interest.” ”

She borrowed 300 yuan and returned 400 yuan.

“After so many years, ye Shu had gotten used to many things. A person’s life was actually very short. There was no need to dwell on some things. ”

“If she hadn’t gotten used to these things, Ye Shu would never have recognized ye Sui as her sister. ”

“Ye Sui was stunned for a moment and then said, “It’s been so many years. It’s hard for you to still remember so clearly.”Didn’t she just ask for a little more interest? Wasn’t it normal to lend money for interest? ”

“Ye Shu smiled at Ye Sui. “If you didn’t mention it, I would have already forgotten.” ”

“Seeing that the topic was becoming more and more stiff, Zhou Ziyue opened her mouth at this time, “Aunty, actually, all these years, my mother has been thinking about you a lot. “Indeed, we shouldn’t have asked for interest on the three hundred Yuan back then. After all, we were family, but those days weren’t easy. My mother was also anxious and confused. Later on, my mother also regretted it very much. She kept saying in front of us that we shouldn’t have charged you interest.” ”

“Ye Sui immediately added, “Right, right, right. Ziyue is very right! Little Shu, I’ve been regretting it all these years. I wanted to apologize to you, but I couldn’t bring myself to do it!” ”

Ye Shu’s expression didn’t change much. “I don’t want to fuss about the past anymore.”

“”Yes, yes, yes, Little Shu. I know that your tolerance has always been the greatest!”Ye Sui smiled apologetically. ”

Ye Shu was indeed different.

It seemed that Zhou Ziyue was right. It was really too difficult to hold ye Shu firmly.

“In the car, ye Sui and Zhou Ziyue, the mother and daughter, quietly exchanged glances. ”

“After blocking the car for half an hour, they finally arrived at the scenic spot. ”

“Ye Shu got out of the car and said to the driver, “Little Liu, go buy the tickets first.” ”

“”Yes, Madam.” ”

Ye Shu brought ye Sui and Zhou Ziyue to the VIP room of the scenic spot’s ticket office.

“As soon as the three of them entered, a waiter welcomed them warmly. ”

“Mrs. Lin.”

Ye Shu smiled.

“The waiter continued, “What would you like to drink, Mrs. Lin?” ”

“”Orange juice will do,”ye Shu said ”

The waiter looked at Zhou Ziyue and ye Sui. “What would you like to drink?”

Ye Sui straightened his back and imitated ye Sui. “We’ll have orange juice as well.”

“”Okay, please wait a moment.” ”

The waiter then walked out.

“Ye Sui was filled with emotions. He lowered his voice and said to Zhou ziyue beside him, “See? Rich people don’t even have to queue when they go out for travel.” ”

Zhou Ziyue didn’t say anything.

“Ye Sui said again, “If you were with Feng Yang, would you be able to enjoy such treatment?” ”

Feng Yang was just a very ordinary person.

“”Mom, why don’t you leave Feng Yang at all times?”Zhou Ziyue asked. ”

“Ye Sui said, “I’m just afraid that you’ll go down the wrong path and have nowhere to regret.” ”

Zhou Ziyue pursed her lips and didn’t say anything.

...

On the other side.

Bai Jingshu hugged the child to sleep.

Lin Ze changed his clothes and walked out of the changing room. “The baby is very obedient today.”

“Bai Jingshu nodded and continued, “Ziyue taught me a few things about newborns. After I did as she said, the baby became much more obedient.” ”

“Zhou Ziyue?”Lin Ze asked.

“Yes.”

Lin Ze frowned slightly. “Don’t interact with her.”

Bai Jingshu was too simple-minded and did not plan anything. Meeting someone like Zhou Ziyue was enough to make her suffer.

“Bai Jingshu recalled how she had interacted with Zhou Ziyue this morning and continued, “I feel that Ziyue is not as bad as you say.” ”

How could a person with a bad personality be so gentle to a child?

“In Zhou Ziyue’s eyes, Bai Jingshu saw not only gentleness but also patience. ”

“Speaking up to this point, Bai Jingshu continued, “Perhaps there’s something wrong with her mother and it has nothing to do with her. Besides, you haven’t interacted much with Ziyue, so how do you know who she is?” ”

“Lin Ze said, “Zhou Ziyue seems to be much more scheming than her mother.” ”

Bai Jingshu smiled. “I know you’re concerned about me. Don’t worry. I know what I’m doing.”

Bai Jingshu had experienced many things and grown up. She also believed in her own judgment of people.

“”But people say that being pregnant is silly for three years. You’re already starting to look silly. I’m a little worried,”Lin ze said half-jokingly. ”

“F * ck you!”Bai Jingshu grabbed a pillow and threw it at Lin Ze.

Lin Ze dodged nimbly.

“”I’m going to the office first,”Lin Ze continued. ”

“Go.”

“Lin Ze continued, “Be wary of Zhou Ziyue.” ”

“Bai Jingshu nodded. “I know, I know!” ”

“Lin Ze walked over and kissed the child in Bai Jingshu’s arms. “Little guy, Don’t Disturb Mommy, okay? Be Obedient!” ”

“After saying that, Lin ze instructed, “Don’t hold him for too long. Just let sister Fang and sister Yue take care of him.” ”

Sister Fang and sister Yue were both sister-in-law in the family. They were usually responsible for taking care of the two children.

“Okay.”

“Then I’ll be leaving first.”

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “If you don’t leave now, it’ll be dark soon!” ”

“”Okay, okay, okay. I’ll leave now.” ”

Lin Ze turned around and left.

“On the other side, Ye Shu brought ye Sui and Zhou Ziyue to tour the scenic spots around them. ”

Ye Sui bought a lot of souvenirs.

“Naturally, Ye Shu was the one who paid for them. ”

“Although the souvenirs were all small things, they still cost tens of thousands of yuan. ”

“If it were any other time, ye Sui wouldn’t dare to spend so much. ”

“Ye Sui looked at Ye Shu and narrowed his eyes. He glanced around and saw the jewelry shop in front, he smiled and said, “There’s a jewelry store in front! Ziyue, haven’t you always wanted a necklace? Come, let’s go in and have a look!” ”

“Okay.”Zhou Ziyue nodded.

The group entered the jewelry store.

The shop assistant saw that ye Shu was not a simple person and immediately welcomed her warmly. “Do you want to buy jewelry?”

“Yes.”Ye Sui nodded. “It’s worn by young girls. Can you recommend it?”

“”This way, please.” ”

“As soon as he arrived at the counter, ye Sui had his eyes on a gold bracelet. ”

“”Let me take a look at that one,”ye Sui said. ”

“Okay.”The shop assistant picked up the bracelet and handed it to ye Sui.

Ye Sui took the bracelet and looked at the label. It weighed 68 grams. It was the heaviest bracelet in the shop.

“According to the current price of gold, this bracelet cost more than 30,000 yuan. ”

“”Ziyue, what do you think of this bracelet?”Ye Sui asked. ”

“Zhou Ziyue wanted to say ‘too vulgar’, but she didn’t say it in the end. Although gold was tacky, it was valuable. ”

“I like it.”Zhou Ziyue nodded.

“Ye Shu said from the side, “If you like it, then buy it.” ”

“The shop assistant immediately said, “Then I’ll help you put it away. Which one do you like?” ”

“This ring is not bad.”Ye Sui immediately took a fancy to the largest ring.

“And this earring is also not bad.”

“...”

“Seeing that ye Shu had no intention of stopping him, ye Sui chose the gold worth more than 100,000. ”

Ye Shu went over to pay.

“On the way back, the smile on ye Sui’s face never disappeared. ”

“When they reached the guest room, ye Sui immediately took out all the trophies from today. “Ziyue, come and take a look. These things will be ours from now on!” ”

“Zhou ziyue said, “These things are nothing to Aunty.” ”

“”That’s true.”The smile on ye Sui’s face quickly disappeared. He continued, “We’ll go shopping tomorrow, but we won’t go to the jewelry store tomorrow. We’ll go directly to buy a villa.” ”

The reason why ye Sui bought so many things today was to test ye Shu.

“In the end, she was very satisfied. ”

“Zhou ziyue said worriedly, “We’ll go tomorrow? What if she doesn’t pay us?” ”

“”She won’t! Don’t Worry!”Ye Sui continued, “She paid for the things that cost more than 100,000 yuan today. She will definitely pay tomorrow!” ”

Zhou Ziyue nodded. “Okay.”

“Ye Sui looked at Zhou Ziyue and continued, “From now on, we’ll be people from the capital!” ”

“She had thought about it. If she wanted to establish herself in the capital, she couldn’t just have a villa. She had to have a career. ”

“Send a message to libang and ask him to come over.”

“Now?”Zhou Ziyue asked in surprise.

“”Yes, now.”Ye Sui nodded. “Anyway, he has nothing to do at home. Ask your aunt to arrange a job for him and make him a CEO.” ”

“The Lin family was powerful and the Lin Corporation was so big. Zhou libang could just come over and be a boss. When that time came, Zhou Libang would be dating a rich second-generation girlfriend and get married. Then, he would be a superior person in the future! ”

“Zhou ziyue continued, “It’s not good to ask Libang to come over now, right? Why don’t we wait for the villa to be arranged before I ask him to come over?” ”

Ye Sui hesitated for a moment and then nodded. “That’s fine too.”

“After all, buying the villa was only a matter of tomorrow. ”
