“Bai Shu called Old Mrs. Cen overnight, hoping that old Mrs. Cen could help persuade Cen Shaoqing not to be angry. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen secretly applauded Cen Shaoqing. That was how one should treat a mistress, “Little Shu, you know Shaoqing’s temper. A few years ago, he became a monk. No matter how hard I tried to persuade him, I couldn’t stop him. Now that your new third daughter-in-law has offended Shaoqing’s daughter-in-law, isn’t that the same as causing trouble for the Lord? You know how protective Shaoqing is of his daughter-in-law. I don’t think Shaoqing will ever step foot in your house again in this lifetime!” ”

Old Lady Cen wasn’t joking.

“Cen Shaoqing didn’t like that kind of man who cheated, and now because of this man who cheated, he made ye Zhuo unhappy. Could This Cen Shaoqing do it? ”

Definitely Not!

He left on the spot and did not make things difficult for Zhao Jiadong.

Bai Shu sighed.

“Old Madam Cen continued, “Little Shu, although the matter has passed, I still have to say it. Yingying is such a good child and a good wife. If your Zhao family did not have her, would you have what you have today? “You let that Vixen enter just because she could not give birth?” ”

Du Yingying was a very strong woman.

“All these years, she had been the only one in charge of the Zhao family. In the early years, some things happened in the Zhao family and they almost couldn’t hold on. If it weren’t for Du Yingying, the Zhao family wouldn’t be where they are today? ”

The Zhao family missed out on such a beautiful and intelligent daughter-in-law. Old Mrs. Cen was really heartbroken!

“After saying that, old Mrs. Cen said again, “Little Shu, let’s split up! Don’t tie the children together. If you don’t split up, everyone will be implicated by your third brother sooner or later!” ”

“Okay.”Bai Shu sighed. “I’ve been thinking about this these past few days.”

“”Think about it carefully. I still have something to do. I’ll hang up first,”old Mrs. Cen said. ”

“Okay.”

“After hanging up, Bai Shu pressed her head, feeling very uncomfortable. ”

Useless third brother!

It was all that useless third brother’s fault!

“In the blink of an eye, the next day arrived. ”

Ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing returned to the capital.

“Originally, Ye Zhuo was prepared to go home directly, but Old Mrs. Cen sent a text message saying that third aunt was going back today. Therefore, Ye Zhuo followed Cen Shaoqing back and sent third aunt off at the same time. ”

Outside the Cen Manor.

“The car to see third aunt off had already stopped at the door. Old Mrs. Cen held third aunt’s hand and said, “His third aunt, you have to bring Xiaotian to visit us in the future.” ”

“”Yes, of course.”Third aunt held old Mrs. Cen’s hand and said, “Haifeng’s mother, thank you for not rejecting me as a poor relative. Thank you!” ”

The third aunt was very touched.

She stayed in the Cen family for four days.

“Through these four days, it could be seen that the CEN old lady really did not disapprove of the two of them. ”

“If it were anyone else, they probably would not be able to do what the Cen Old Lady did. ”

“”Look at you, Old Lady, what nonsense are you talking about!”The Cen Old Lady held the third aunt’s hand tightly. “We are all family. I welcome you to visit our house frequently.” ”

“Okay.”The third aunt nodded.

“At this moment, the housekeeper walked over and said, “Old Lady, everything is ready. Come over and take a look. Is there anything missing?” ”

Old Lady Cen looked at the housekeeper. “Is everything arranged according to the List I gave you?”

“Yes.”The housekeeper nodded.

“Old Lady Cen continued to instruct, “After you send the third aunt back, send some gifts to every family in their manor. Ask them to help take care of the third aunt. In the future, our Cen family will not mistreat them!” ”

“Okay.”

“The third aunt looked at Old Mrs. Cen, “Haifeng’s mother, You’ve given me things and money, and now you’ve done all this for me. I really don’t know how to thank you! Tianshun, Tianshun! Quickly kowtow to the ancestor and thank your ancestor!” ”

“Currently, the third aunt and the others were ostracized in the village. Old Mrs. Cen sent people over at this time to support the third aunt and the others. She wanted to let the villagers know that the third aunt’s family had a backer in the city, if they treated third aunt well, they would get benefits in the future. ”

“As long as there was profit to be made, those people would definitely not continue to ostracize third aunt and the others. ”

“Although third aunt was old, she still understood this point. ”

“Little Tian Shun immediately knelt down and kowtowed. “Thank you, ancestor.” ”

Old Madam Cen quickly pulled Little Tian shun up. “This silly child really kowtowed!”

The third aunt wiped her tears again.

“At this moment, Cen Shaoqing and ye Zhuo walked in from outside. “Third grandmother, aren’t you going to bring Little Tianshun home to play for a few more days?” ”

“”This is?”The third aunt was old and could not remember Cen Shaoqing and ye Zhuo for a moment. It took her a moment to react. “This is zhuozhuo and Shaoqing, right? They have been disturbing your grandmother here for a few days already. It’s time to go back!” ”

“Ye Zao half-squatted down and looked at Zhou Tianshun. “Little Tianshun, have your snot improved over the past few days?” ”

“”Much better. Thank you, pretty sister,”said Little Tianshun. ”

“The third aunt hurriedly said, “You silly child, you can’t call me sister. According to seniority, you should call me aunt.” ”

“”Thank you, pretty aunt!”Little Tianshun immediately corrected himself. ”

Ye Zhuo smiled slightly. “You’re welcome. Remember to come and play often in the future.”

“Okay.”Little Tian Shun nodded.

Old Mrs. Cen gave the housekeeper some more instructions before getting the chauffeur to send them off.

“”His third aunt, have a safe journey. Housekeeper, don’t forget to give us a call when you arrive.” ”

“”Yes, old madam, I understand.” ”

“Looking at the direction where the car disappeared, old madam Cen sighed. “Your third aunt is a pitiful person.” ”

“Ye Zhuo held old madam Cen’s arm and said with a smile, “Fortunately, she met you, grandmother.” ”

“Old Madam Cen could not open her mouth from ye Zhuo’s coaxing. She continued, “How was your trip to South City? Did you see your aunt?” ”

Ye Zao nodded slightly. “I did. The two elders were very enthusiastic.”

“Okay.”Old Mrs. Cen nodded and turned to look at Cen Shaoqing. “Did you tell your aunt and aunt that I’m going to visit them?”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Then how did your Aunt React?” ”

“”You’ll know when you go,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen kicked Cen Shaoqing in the leg. “You Stinky Brat, you’re really annoying. Why are you keeping your grandmother in suspense!” ”

“Ye Zhuo held old Mrs. Cen’s arm, “Grandma Cen, after little aunt heard that you were going to visit her, she was very happy. She even prepared a lot of gifts for you, filling up the entire carriage. In the end, she even complained that our car didn’t have as much space as the tractor.” ” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Old Mrs. Cen chuckled and said, “My granddaughter-in-law is still the best, unlike that stinky brat! He’s so annoying when he sees her! The Sun is an immortal board!” ”

Ye Zhuo didn’t quite understand the last sentence. “The Sun is an immortal board? What does that mean?”

“Old Mrs. Cen recalled Zhou Xiang’s explanation to Cen Yuyan. She smiled and said, “It means that fairies are flying all over the sky!” ”

“OH.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

Cen Shaoqing:”...”how could he always forget that he was picked up?
