Chapter 129: 082: How does she match up to her? She doesn’t even have the ability to see! 2

Ye Zao nodded.

50 yuan for 20 laps. He would take whatever he could get.

Because of the distance, many people spent hundreds of yuan but couldn’t get anything.

Lin Sha went to buy 20 laps and gave 10 to ye Zao.

Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly. “So many laps. I’ll get all of them later. With so many things, how can I take them down the mountain?”

When the stall owner heard this, he smiled and said, “Young Lady, you talk big! If you can get all of them, I will personally send you down the mountain.”

“Boss, a gentleman’s word”

The stall owner immediately replied, “A promise is a promise!”

He had made his fortune by doing the laps business. After 20 years of business, he had only managed to get half of the 20 laps from the most powerful person he had ever met.

The boss would never believe that a young girl who looked no more than eighteen years old could get a ring!

Ye Zao smiled. “I’m relieved to hear that! Then I’ll have to trouble you to bring me forty more rings.”

Since the Boss had sent her down the mountain, he did not have to worry about not being able to carry them anymore.

“Okay.”The boss immediately brought forty rings.

Lin Sha was stunned. “Searing, are you really that good?”

“Of course.”Ye searing wasn’t modest.

Lin Sha continued, “I’ll try to trap one first.”As she spoke, Lin Sha threw out a ring.

Unfortunately, she didn’t manage to trap anything.

The stall owner smiled and went to pick up the ring.

Lin Sha threw out another one.

It still didn’t work!

All the way until the third and fourth ring didn’t work.

Lin Sha Sighed.

It didn’t look too far away, so why was it so difficult to set it up!

The stall owner looked up at ye Zao, “This little girl, aren’t you going to try?”

Ye Zao looked up slightly, “Watch carefully, don’t blink.”

After saying that, ye Zao casually threw a ring out.

PA!

There was a pikachu in the middle of the red circle.

“Holy shit!”Lin Sha jumped up excitedly. “Awesome!”

The stall owner was also stunned.

Hit It once?

It must be a coincidence!

The stall owner walked over to pick up the Pikachu. Ye Zao said, “Boss, wait a moment. It’s too troublesome to pick up one Pikachu after another. When I’m done with all the traps, you can pick them up together.”

The stall owner was delighted. “Sure.”He wanted to see if this little girl was really that amazing!

Ye Zao tilted his head and looked at Lin Sha. “Sister Sha Sha, which ones do you like?”

Lin Sha said in surprise, “You can get all the ones I like?”

Ye Zao nodded.

Lin Sha pointed at the panda doll on the ground and said, “I like that one.”

“What else?”

“Ah?”Lin Shasha was stunned.

Ye Zhuo continued, “It’s too troublesome to trap them one by one. I want to trap ten of them at once.”

Lin Shasha swallowed her saliva.

The stall owner could not help but laugh out loud.

This little girl was very interesting!

He had been in business for so many years, but he had never seen such a confident person. He had also never seen someone who wanted to trap ten of them at once.

The young girls nowadays were really good at bragging!

Lin Sha pointed at a few toys.

Ye Zao decided not to count the rings in his hands.

He grabbed a handful and threw it out.

It was like a fairy scattering flowers.

When the rings fell to the ground, Lin Sha was scared silly.

F * CK, F * ck!

She really hit all of them.

She looked up at Ye Zao.

Ye Zao was extremely calm, as if the person who threw the circle was not her. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The stall owner and the passers-by were also stunned.

No one had expected that ye Zao would be so powerful.

Ye Zao then grabbed a bunch of circles and threw them out again.

Without a doubt.

She hit all of them again.

“Clap Clap Clap!”Deafening applause sounded around them.

If they had not seen it with their own eyes, no one would have believed that a teenage girl would be so powerful.

Other people were here to set traps.

She was also here to do wholesale.

This time, the Boss had suffered a huge loss.

Ye Zhuo turned to look at the stall owner. “Boss, please help us send it to the foot of the mountain. We will wait for you at the foot of the mountain.”

The boss felt that his entire person was in a bad mood.

However, the most important thing in doing business was to be honest!

Since he had already promised ye Zao before.

Even if it was a loss now, he would still do it.

He would learn from his mistakes.

Next time, he could not belittle anyone.

Especially the young and pretty little girl.

“Okay.”The boss nodded, “I’ll have my son send her down in a while. Little Girl, you know there’s a pine tree at the foot of the mountain, right? I’ll have my son wait for you there. By the way, this is my business card. If you have any questions, you can call this number.”
