“Chapter 1115: 244: Ruthless, face slapping as fast as the speed of light! 5”

“Meow.”

“Let’s Go!”Whitey increased its power and rushed forward quickly.

“Whitey’s equipment was very high. When it was fully charged, running 80-90 kilometers was no problem at all. ”

“Not long after, Whitey rushed out of the manor area and came to the busy downtown area. ”

“When it reached the front, little white suddenly stopped. ”

“”Meow?”Brother Meow called out in puzzlement, as if asking why it had stopped. ”

“Little White said, “Are you an idiot! Can’t you see that there’s a red light ahead?” ”

“Hearing this, a child who wanted to run a red light was so scared that he immediately retracted his foot and turned to look at little white. ”

“He widened his eyes in curiosity and tugged at the hands of the adults beside him. “Mommy, Mommy! What is this thing?” ”

“Coincidentally, the red light turned green. ”

Whoosh —

Whitey immediately rushed out.

The young mother turned around and looked lonely. “What is it?”

“It was there just now! It was still talking!”

The mother bent down and carried the child. “You saw wrongly.”

“I didn’t see wrongly! It really was there!”

“The mother smiled helplessly. “Alright, Alright, Alright! It was there just like you said.” ”

“”It’s not like that.”The child felt a little wronged. “There really was a cat just now! Its head was round, and it had a big belly. On its belly grew a super big fat cat!” ”

A Cat on its belly?

This child must have watched too many cartoons.

“His mother continued to smile perfunctorily. “Alright, Alright. I understand.” ”

The child was about to cry.

He really saw it!

But why didn’t his mother believe him?

...

Shunxi Financial Group.

Ye Zhuo dialed his secretary’s internal line. “Allie?”

“”The President is me.”Hearing ye Zhuo’s voice, Allie immediately straightened her back and sat upright. ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Tidy up the financial statements of the Financial Group for the past ten years and bring them over.” ”

What was the lifeline of a financial group?

Wealth.

“If a consortium could not even manage the most basic word ‘wealth’, then it would not be far from going bankrupt. ”

“If one wanted to do a good job, one must first sharpen their tools. ”

“If ye Zhuo wanted to take control of the Shunxi consortium in a short period of time, he had to figure out the financial situation of the Shunxi Consortium for the past ten years. ”

“After experiencing the incident with Liu Neng, Allie did not dare to neglect ye Zhuo anymore. ”

She didn’t want to become the second Liu Neng.

“Not only was she fired from the financial group, but she also added a black mark on her resume. ”

It would be difficult for Liu Neng to join a large financial group in the future.

Unless in her next life.

“”Okay, right away.” ”

“After hanging up the phone, Allie immediately went to the finance department to organize the financial statements. ”

“Ten years of financial statements, a whole basket. ”

One person couldn’t carry it at all.

Ali could only find another secretary from the Secretary team to help her.

The two of them carried the basket and walked out.

“Just as they reached the waiting area of the elevator, they bumped into Si Lu, who was walking towards them. ”

“Chairman Si.”Ali and Lai Si greeted him respectfully.

Si Lu looked at the basket that the two of them were carrying and frowned slightly. “What are you guys going to do?” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Allie explained, “Send the financial statements to the President.” ”

“So Many?”Si lui continued to ask.

“Yes.”Allie nodded. “The president asked me to send her the financial statements of the Financial Group for the past ten years.”

The financial statements for the past ten years?

What did ye Zhuo want to do?

“With her brain, how could she understand the financial statements of the financial world? ”

“Moreover, with so many financial statements, when was she going to see them? ”

Was she putting on an Act?

Ding —

“At this moment, the elevator door opened. ”

“Allie turned to look at Si Lu. “Chairman Si, we’ll be going up first.” ”

Si Lu nodded.

“Allie and Lai Si carried the basket to ye Zhuo’s office and knocked on the door. “Miss Ye, we’re here.” ”

“Come in.”Ye Zhuo’s voice came from inside the room.

Allie pushed the door open and entered.

“”President, these are the financial statements you requested.” ”

“Ten years old?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly.

“Yes.”

Ye Zhuo stood up from the boss’s chair and walked to the front. He placed the basket on the office desk with one hand.

“At this moment, Allie and Lai Si thought that they were hallucinating. ”

This basket weighed at least 50 to 60 pounds.

Both of them felt that it was too heavy to carry.

But Ye Zao...

He actually picked it up with one hand.

“And it was light, as if it was not heavy at all. ”

Allie and Lai Si looked at each other and saw the disbelief in each other’s eyes.

“Ye Zao picked up the report in the basket. After a moment, he looked up slightly. “It’s missing 18 and 11 years.” ”

“I don’t think so! I remember I’ve found all of them!”Allie was stunned.

Ye Zhuo didn’t say anything more and put all the documents on the desk. “Read them yourself.”
