“Lin Jincheng’s memory was damaged by the car accident. Sometimes, he would suddenly lose his memory. He needed to read his diary to remember those past events. ”

What Old Mrs. Lin asked him to do was to secretly change Lin Jincheng’s diary.

This new diary was written by Old Mrs. Lin who had someone copy Lin Jincheng’s handwriting.

The memories in it were pretty much the same.

“The only difference was that the female lead, Ye Shu, was changed to Feng Qianhua. ”

One of Ye Shu’s twins was changed to Feng Xianxian.

“This way, Feng Qianhua could successfully become the matriarch of the Lin family, and Feng Xianxian would become the eldest daughter of the Lin family. ”

Lin Jincheng usually looked at this diary more than his own life.

Secretary Zhang really couldn’t bear to betray Lin Jin Cheng’s trust.

But now.

He had no other choice.

He couldn’t just watch his son and daughter die...

“Secretary Zhang took a deep breath and took out the notebook with trembling hands. Then, he took out another identical notebook from the file bag and swapped it in. ”

“After doing all this, secretary Zhang called Old Mrs. Lin. ”

“Old Mrs. Lin immediately picked up the phone. “Secretary Zhang! You’ve done well in this matter. Don’t worry, you’ll have a bright future.” ”

Secretary Zhang’s face was full of bitterness.

“Old Mrs. Lin continued, “Clean up that old notebook for me.” ”

“Got it.”

Secretary Zhang brought the document bag out of the office.

On the other side.

The Lin family.

“After Old Mrs. Lin hung up the phone, a smile appeared on her face. ”

She had waited for so many years.

“Finally, she had hope. ”

“When she thought about how Feng Qianhua was about to become the daughter-in-law of the Lin family, the smile on Madam Lin’s face became even wider. ”

“Feng Qianhua brought the dishes to the table. “Aunt Lin, what are you smiling about?” ”

Madam Lin glanced at Feng Qianhua. “It’s a secret!”

“Feng Qianhua asked curiously, “Is there anything else that I can’t Know?” ”

“”You’ll know when the time comes.”Old Madam Lin held Feng Qianhua’s hand, she said earnestly, “Qianhua, I’ve made you suffer in our Lin family all these years. Don’t worry, I’ll immediately get Jin City to give you a proper title!” ”

Feng Qianhua had waited for Lin Jin city for more than 19 years.

“If it were anyone else, would they be able to do what she did? ”

“Feng Qianhua smiled and said, “Aunt Lin, you’re being too polite by saying this. All these years, you’ve always treated me as your own daughter and Xianxian as your own granddaughter. What I’ve done is nothing compared to what you’ve done.” ”

“Old Madam Lin looked at Feng Qianhua lovingly, “I don’t want you to be my daughter! In My Heart, you’ve always been my daughter-in-law and Ah Ze’s mother! If it weren’t for you, our Lin family would have collapsed long ago!” ”

Old Madam Lin was very satisfied with Feng Qianhua.

She liked her from the start.

“Unfortunately, Lin Jincheng was too rebellious at that time. He didn’t like the daughter-in-law, Feng Qianhua, and fell in love with the fickle ye Shu. ”

“”No.”Feng Qianhua looked at Old Madam Lin, she said emotionally, “Aunt Lin, I’m really not as good as you think. Besides, I volunteered to wait for Brother Jincheng. I know that brother Jincheng has always had ye Shu in his heart, and he has never forgotten her...” ”

“Hearing this, old madam Lin interrupted feng qianhua, “A fickle woman like ye Shu is not worthy of being remembered by Jin Cheng for so many years! Qianhua, don’t worry, Jin Cheng will soon forget ye Shu!” ”

Old Mrs. Lin specifically asked Lin Jin Cheng’s attending doctor.

“Because of the serious damage to his cerebellum, Lin Jin Cheng would forget about the memory from 19 years ago about once every month to half a month. During this period, he would rely on his diary to recover his memory. ”

“When Lin Jin Cheng forgot about Ye Shu again, he would definitely flip through the diary. ”

“At that time, Feng Qianhua would be ye Shu. ”

“Thinking of this, Old Lady Lin’s eyes were filled with light. It was as if she could already see Feng Qianhua marrying into the Lin family. ”

Feng Qianhua narrowed her eyes slightly.

A faint light quickly flashed across her eyes.

So...

Old Lady Lin had already succeeded?

“Feng Qianhua hid the expression in her eyes very well and continued, “Aunt Lin, let’s not talk about these things. This is the tofu soup that I specially made for you. Please try it and see if it tastes good.” ”

“Old people had bad teeth, so they liked to eat soft things. ”

“Aunt Zhang added, “Old Lady, in order to make this tofu soup, Miss Qianhua has been busy for more than two hours. This soup is made with lamb and old hens. It’s very fresh. You have to eat more later.” ”
