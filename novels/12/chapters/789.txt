“Chapter 790: 175: face-smacking, dog-eat-dog, Old Lady Lin has exposed Feng Xianxian’s true face! 1”

“”Of course it’s real.”Ye Zhuo turned to look at Lin Jincheng. “Although there isn’t much money in it, it’s more than enough to fill the gap in the Lin group’s funds.” ”

It’s real!

“Lin Jincheng had never expected that this card was real, and the expression on his face was very complicated. ”

This was Sw0itzerland Bank’s diamond black card.

There were only three in the world!

“After a while, Lin Jincheng continued, “Zhonghua, did Shaoqing give you this card?” ”

“After thinking about it, only Cen Shaoqing had the ability to do so. ”

“Ye Zhonghua was a doctor in the science and Technology field and had achievements in the medical field. However, it was not enough to apply for this black card. ”

“Ye Zao curled his lips slightly. “Dad, do you think I look like the kind of person who reaches out and asks a man for money?” ”

Ye Zao had never been a person who relied on a man to live.

She had always believed that only when she was strong was she truly strong!

Lin Jincheng was stunned.

Ye Zao really did not look like one!

“Then where did you get this card from?”Lin Jincheng continued to ask.

“Ye Zao said, “I opened a small company myself, so I made a little money. Dad, don’t worry. This money came from a normal source, so you can use it without worry!” ”

A small company?

Made a little money? Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“If it was just a small company, would ye Zao have a Black Diamond Card from Sw0itzerland Bank? ”

This kind of black diamond card did not have any assets. It could not be handled without any local power.

Lin Jin Cheng suddenly did not understand how small the small company Ye Zao was talking about was...

Just how much of Ye Zao’s side was unknown?

“For a moment, Lin Jincheng was stunned. ”

“After a long while, Lin Jincheng finally reacted and continued, “Zao, your father can’t take your money. You Don’t have to worry about the company. I’ll think of another way.” ”

“After saying that, Lin Jincheng returned the black card to ye Zao. ”

“It was one thing for ye Zao not to fulfill his responsibility as a father for a day, but now he had to use ye Zao’s money to fill the hole in the capital. This made Lin Jincheng feel very apologetic. ”

“Ye Zhuo picked up the backpack on the table. “Dad, just take it. This money is not for free. Just treat it as me joining the LIN Group. When you have the annual meeting at the end of the year, remember to give me a share of the dividends.” ”

“Lin Jin Cheng looked at Ye Zhuo’s back and his lips moved. He seemed to want to say something, but ye Zhuo waved at Lin Jin Cheng without turning his head, stopping Lin Jin Cheng from saying anything. ”

Ye Zao had just left.

The secretary hurried over. “President Lin is in trouble!”

“What’s Wrong?”Lin Jincheng turned to look at the secretary.

“The secretary said breathlessly, “Please follow me downstairs to take a look!” ”

“Seeing the secretary like this, Lin Jincheng’s eyebrows jumped and he immediately went to the company hall. ”

“Many core technical staff of the LIN Group gathered in the hall. At this moment, everyone was making a fuss about resigning. ”

“These were the elites of the LIN Group. If they really left, the LIN Group would not be able to operate anymore. ”

It was obvious that all of this was the work of a few shareholders.

They were trying to force the LIN Group to a dead end.

Lin Jincheng had never thought that Zhou Dawei and the other four shareholders would do something so extreme!

“”Uncle Zhou!”Lin Jincheng walked to Zhou Dawei’s side, “You and my father have come all the way here. You have witnessed the decline and prosperity of the LIN Group together. It was not easy for the LIN Group to get to where it is today. I can understand why the five of you withdrew your investment. After all, people are selfish. But you don’t have to take away the backbone of the company, right?” ”

“Zhou Dawei glanced at Lin Jincheng, he smiled and said, “Jincheng, you think too highly of your uncle Zhou! “If these backbone members of the company want to leave, it has nothing to do with us old shareholders. If they want to leave, they can leave. If they want to stay, they can stay. Do you think we can restrict their personal freedom?” ”

“At this point, Zhou Dawei paused and continued, “People go higher, water flows lower. Jincheng, this is what people want. Since everyone is willing to follow me, I Can’t refuse, right?” ”

“Lin Jincheng nodded. “Good! Good saying, people go higher, water flows lower! Uncle Zhou, thank you for teaching me such a lesson today.” ”

“After saying that, Lin Jincheng turned to look at the crowd, then, he said, “If you all want to leave your jobs, go to the personnel department to go through the resignation procedures. I, Lin, will never say a single word to make you stay. However, I, Lin, also put it here today. If you don’t accompany me at sunset, who are you to rise again? Our Lin group will never hire someone who has betrayed the group before!” ”

“With the development of the matter, Lin Jin Cheng did not panic. ”

A blessing in disguise.
