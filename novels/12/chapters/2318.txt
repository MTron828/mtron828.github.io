Now was not the best time.

“Ye Zao was like an unkillable cockroach. If Wen Zhi was exposed at this time, the plan would definitely change. ”

“No matter what, they could not let ye Zao stand up this time! ”

“A moment later, MI Jiadi turned to look at Kevin. “Are you sure this is true?” ”

“After dealing with ye Zao for more than two years, Mi Jia Di knew that ye Zao would not be so easily fooled. ”

Farewell was just a wild joy in the end.

“Hearing this, Kevin’s face was full of speechlessness. ”

It was not true?

“If it was not true, how could it be fake? ”

Ye Zao could not sacrifice the plants that had survived on Mars to put on an act with them!

Unless ye Zao went crazy!

This was simply a fantasy.

Mi Jiadi narrowed her eyes.

“Kevin smiled and said, “Doctor, don’t worry. As long as ye Zao has a brain, he won’t do such a thing.” ”

“If ye Zao really did such a thing, he could only say that ye Zao was too stupid. ” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Mi Jiadi nodded.

“Actually, what Kevin said made sense. If all of this was just ye Zao’s self-directed and self-acting, then not only would ye Zao not hurt anyone’s interests, he would even raise a rock to hit his own feet. ”

...

On the other side.

Mars was in a mess.

No one had expected that the oasis project would suddenly change. They had not expected that the previously thriving plants would all be destroyed in an instant.

Ye Zao held an emergency meeting overnight. All the top scientists from the Mars base gathered together to discuss a solution.

“After all, the press conference was about to start. ”

“At that time, Ye Zhuo would have to face the media all over the world. ”

“If the OASIS project was announced to be a failure, Ye Zhuo’s reputation would be ruined. ”

“Wen Zhi looked at the people around him who were in a hurry, and the corners of his mouth curled into a proud smile. ”

They would never have thought that all of this was because of him.

Wen Zhi felt a sense of accomplishment.

“Although he did not have much of a presence in the base and did not even have the chance to speak to ye Zao, he had personally destroyed the myth that ye Zao had created. ”

Could an ordinary person do it?

It was impossible!

“Thinking of this, Wen Zhi’s heart was filled with an irreplaceable sense of superiority. ”

“If ye Zao knew that he was the one who caused all of this, Ye Zao would definitely collapse! ”

“At this moment, professor Zhang ran over from not far away. “Assistant Wen!” ”

“Wen Zhi immediately reacted and looked back. “Professor Zhang, you called for me.” ”

“Yes.”Professor Zhang nodded and handed the information in his hands to him. “Please pass this to Captain Yu.”

“Okay.”Wen Zhi took the information with both hands and nodded.

“Professor Zhang continued, “The information in this is very important. It’s very important. You must not give it to anyone else! Only captain Yu can see it. Send it over immediately!” ”

“”Okay, don’t worry,”wen zhi said, “I will definitely remember your words.” ”

“Professor Zhang was initially suspicious of Wen Zhi because he felt that something was wrong with him recently. However, after listening to Yu Zifei’s words yesterday, he was no longer on guard against Wen Zhi, after all, Yu Zifei was the person who understood Wen Zhi the most. If even Yu Zifei said that Wen Zhi had no problems, then Wen Zhi definitely had no problems. ”

“Professor Zhang nodded and said, “Go quickly!” ”

Wen Zhi immediately turned around and walked towards Yu Zifei’s office.

Professor Zhang also turned around and left.

“After taking a few steps, he felt a little worried. After all, the documents were so important. It would be best if he delivered them personally. What if something went wrong? ”

“Thinking of this, professor Zhang turned around and chased after him. ”

“Professor Zhang!”Tang Mi’s anxious voice suddenly appeared in the air.

“Team leader Tang.”Professor Zhang turned to look at Tang Mi.

“Tang mi continued, “Miss Ye is looking for you. Please follow me.” ”

“Okay.”Professor Zhang nodded.

“After saying that, professor Zhang said with some worry, “I just gave the information to Captain Yu’s assistant, Xiao Wen, and asked Xiao Wen to send it over. There won’t be any problems, right?” ”

“Tang mi said, “Don’t worry. Xiao Wen is Captain Yu’s personal assistant. He has been in the base for a long time. If anyone has any problems, he won’t have any problems.” ”

“Speaking of which, Wen Zhi and Yu Zifei had a history. ”

Wen Zhi’s hometown and Yu Zifei were together.

“Therefore, during the interview, Yu Zifei valued Wen Zhi at first glance. ”

“”You’re right.”Dr. Zhang nodded and continued, “I was being paranoid for a day. Don’t mind me, team leader Tang!” ”
