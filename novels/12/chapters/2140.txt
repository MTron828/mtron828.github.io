Ye Zao.

The assistant repeated it again.

“Man Xing frowned slightly, the expression on his face was a little complicated. ”

“If this person was really ye Zao, then the game of chess would be even bigger. ”

“Do you have a clearer picture?”Man Xing asked.

“”Wait a moment, I’ll look for it,”the assistant said. ”

Man Xing nodded slightly.

“The assistant turned on the monitor, but it was very strange that the 360-degree surveillance camera did not capture a positive photo of ye Zao. ” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Most of the photos were of his side profile or back.

“A moment later, the assistant looked up at man Xing. “Miss, I can’t find a positive photo.” ”

There was no positive photo?

That was even more strange!

Man Xing frowned. “Go and call madam over.”

“Okay.”The assistant went out to look for Zhao Dan.

Zhao Dan was originally sitting with a few noble ladies to discuss the details of the begging festival.

“Although the s galaxy was outside the Milky Way, the people of man Xing country still attached great importance to the traditional festivals left behind by their ancestors. ”

“Furthermore, with the development of technology, the number of single men and women in man Xing country was also increasing day by day. Many men and women were waiting for this important day to get rid of their single status. ”

“However, when she heard her assistant say that Manxing was looking for her, Zhao Dan immediately put down what she was doing and followed her assistant to Manxing’s study. ”

“”Xing ‘er, why are you looking for me?” ”

“Manxing pointed at the transparent screen in the air and said, “Mom, who do you think this is?” ”

“Upon hearing this, Zhao Dan’s gaze immediately locked onto the figure on the screen. Immediately, her eyes narrowed slightly. “This, this is... Ye Zhuo?” ”

“”Mom, do you also think that she looks like her?”Man Xing asked. ”

“Looks like her?”Zhao Dan frowned slightly. “Could it be that this isn’t Ye Zhuo?”

“MAN XING said, “Her name is Ye Zhuo, but she isn’t miss ye from Chang Yue. Mom, do you know who she is?” ”

Zhao Dan shook his head. “Who is she?”

“”She is the girlfriend that the young master of Dongli brought back from Earth,”man Xing said. ”

“What? !”Zhao Dan’s expression changed.

How could this be?

This was obviously ye Zhuo!

“Although it was just a side profile, no one would mistake their own daughter! ”

Zhao Dan was very sure that this was ye Zhuo.

“But if she was ye Zhuo, why would she become the girlfriend that young master Dongli brought back from Earth? ”

What exactly happened?

“MAN XING continued, “Mom, why do you think sister suddenly took the throne?” ”

“Because of Ye Han...”

“”No,”man Xing directly interrupted Zhao Dan’s unfinished words, “Mom, we guessed wrong from the beginning. It’s not that sister can’t hold on to her position, but she doesn’t need this position anymore!” ”

“The main alliance country ruled the three countries, so what was a mere monarch of changyue? ”

Ye Zhuo was really a good plan!

“This way, firstly, she could ditch Manxing country, and secondly, she could be the wife of the main alliance in Peace! ”

“Zhao Dan also thought of this, “Could it be that, could it be that she planned it in advance?” ”

“”Yes.”Manxing nodded and said gently, “However, we can’t completely blame sister. After all, we let sister down first. If it were anyone else, they would have an opinion about us.” ”

“This unfilial daughter! I’m her mother! She actually lied to me! She’s really good!”Zhao Dan was so angry that she turned green.

The reason why she gave up on recognizing ye Zhuo was that ye Zhuo had no value anymore.

But who knew that all of this was ye Zhuo’s plan!

UNFILIAL daughter!

“If other people’s daughters had benefits, they would definitely think of their family first. But Ye Zhuo was good. Not only did he not think of his family, but he was also busy trying to distance himself from his family. ”

How could she give birth to such a daughter!

“Such a person, not to mention Manxing, she could not even compare to Manxing. ”

“The more Zhao Dan thought about it, the angrier she got. ”

“”Mom, please don’t be angry.”Manxing continued, “All of this is just my guess. I believe that elder sister would definitely not do such a thing.” ”

“”You are just too kind. You think of everyone so well!”Zhao dan continued, “Back then, she had already treated me like that, and you still said that you wanted to forgive her and be considerate of her. Now, look at you! She has soared and directly kicked us far away! She wants to break off relations with us! It’s not that simple!” ”

“The main alliance valued blood relations the most. Once she announced this news, even if ye Zhuo did not want to acknowledge her as his mother, he had to acknowledge her! ”

Did she really think that it was so easy to repay the kindness of having a child?

“”Mom, calm down first.”Man Xing comforted Zhao Dan’s emotions, then he said, “Mom, don’t worry. I know you’re in a hurry to introduce yourself to elder sister so that the five of us can reunite as soon as possible. But I heard that young master Dongli’s girlfriend is a native of Earth, but elder sister is different. “I want to send someone to investigate her background.” ”
