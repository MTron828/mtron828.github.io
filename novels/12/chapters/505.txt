Translator: 549690339

Old Mrs. Cen had watched Lin Jin Cheng grow up. She knew Lin Jin Cheng’s character too well.

“Old Mrs. Lin exploded when she heard this. “What do you mean I caused Jin Cheng to lose a leg? It was clearly that promiscuous, cheating B * Tch! If it weren’t for her, would Jin Cheng Be in such a hurry to Drive?””

“Old Mrs. Cen asked back, “If you didn’t stop them from meeting their lovers, would jin city be in such a hurry? In the end, the main cause is still you.””

“Old Mrs. Lin said with extreme excitement, “Then it’s all that B * Tch’s fault. If she wasn’t pregnant with a bastard child and was also cuckolded by Jin City, would I have stopped them from meeting?””

Could this matter be blamed on her?

“Old Mrs. Cen mercilessly exposed reality, “At that time, you didn’t think that Ah Ze’s mother and your Lin family were of equal status, right? You were too snobbish! Moreover, whether Ah Ze’s mother had an affair or not was still one thing! Don’t be anxious. Just stay at home and wait for Jin City to return. I believe that Jin City will definitely give you a satisfactory answer!””

Old Mrs. Cen was a very rational person. She never believed one-sided words.

“Although she was not Lin Jin city’s mother, she trusted Lin Jin city more than old Mrs. Lin.”

Old Mrs. Lin was so angry that her face turned pale.

“At this moment, there was another knock on the door.”

“”Come in,”old Mrs. Lin said.”

“Grandma.”Feng Xianxian walked in from outside.

“When she saw Feng Xianxian, the anger in Old Lady Lin’s heart instantly disappeared without a trace. “Xianxian, come here quickly. This is your Grandma Cen.””

Old Lady Cen.

“A bright light flashed in Feng Xianxian’s eyes as she walked over with a smile. “Hello, Grandma Cen.””

Old Lady Cen nodded.

“Feng Xianxian continued, “Grandma Cen, you look so noble and overbearing. At first glance, I thought that some Bodhisattva had descended to the mortal world!””

“As an old man, he loved to pray for his life. In addition, fifth master Cen also believed in Buddhism. If he praised Old Lady Cen so much, Old Lady Cen would definitely be very happy.”

“Feng Xianxian was a very smart person. She knew what to say when she met someone. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have coaxed Old Lady Lin so happily.”

“However, Old Lady Cen furrowed her brows without leaving a trace.”

“Perhaps it was because she had been with ye Zao for a long time, which caused her to unconsciously compare herself to ye Zao whenever she saw anyone.”

“Their Ye Zi was not as flowery as Feng Xianxian. She was so frivolous when it was her first time meeting someone, and every time she opened her mouth, she would flatter them.”

“Because she was the Cen family’s old lady, Feng Xianxian’s mouth was so sweet. If she was not the Cen family’s old lady, Feng Xianxian probably would not even look at her.”

The Cen Old Lady responded with a smile.

“Seeing Old Lady Cen Smile, Feng Xianxian was very pleased. She knew that she would definitely be able to win Old Lady Cen’s favor.”

Old Lady Cen and Old Lady Lin had such a good relationship. Perhaps old lady cen already saw her as her future granddaughter-in-law!

“Old Lady Lin Glanced at Feng Xianxian and said, “Xianxian, your mother is in the kitchen. Go and see if there’s anything you need help with.””

“Feng Xianxian knew that Old Lady Lin had something to say to Old Lady Lin, and it might even be about her and fifth master Cen. She nodded and said, “Yes, Grandmother.””

“After Feng Xianxian left, Old Lady Lin looked at Old Lady Cen. “What do you think of Xianxian?””

Old Lady Cen’s face was full of wariness. “What do you want?” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Old Lady Lin continued, “Didn’t your Shaoqing’s marriage in Yun Jing End? So I want...””

“”Don’t even think about it!”Old Lady Cen interrupted old lady cen, “Our young master is already taken! My granddaughter-in-law is the most beautiful woman in the world, the best in the world. No one can steal her!””

“”You’ve chosen another one?”Old Lady Lin frowned, “Do you know what kind of character the woman is? Aren’t you being too hasty!””

“Old Lady Cen said, “Don’t worry, my granddaughter-in-law is the best granddaughter-in-law in the world!””

“”You really don’t want to consider Xianxian?”Old Lady Lin continued, “Xianxian can have whatever she wants. She’s not worse than anyone else! !””

“Old Lady Cen snorted coldly, “She’s far inferior to my precious granddaughter-in-law!””

“Old Lady Lin was not happy to hear this, “Xianxian is the capital’s College Entrance Exam’s detective flower! She’s truly talented and beautiful.””

“Old Lady Cen said with a proud face, “My granddaughter-in-law is the top scorer in Yunjing City! which place is Xianxian?””

“Yunjing is just a small place. Isn’t it normal to get the top scorer in the city? Yunjing’s top scorer can barely compare to the tenth place in the capital.”
