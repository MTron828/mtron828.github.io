Translator: 549690339

Never in his wildest dreams did Mario expect that the exotic beast he had personally nurtured would one day lose control and become like this.

“He looked at the fleeing crowd and the collapsed buildings, his eyes filled with sorrow. ”

What should he do now?

What should he do!

“Mario began to regret. He regretted that he had not listened to ye Zao’s words, and even more regretted that he had not destroyed the exotic beast earlier. ”

He had an inescapable responsibility for things turning out like this!

Bang!

“At this moment, a huge boulder rolled over from the side and pressed down on Mario’s leg. ”

Mario’s face was filled with pain. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Pain!

A piercing pain!

“”Doctor!”At this moment, the assistant ran over from the side. “Doctor, don’t be anxious. I’ll Save You Right Now!” ”

“Seeing the assistant, Mario didn’t know what expression he should use to face him. ”

It was all his fault that l continent had become like this.

He was the one who insisted on doing it!

“The assistant seemed to have seen through Mario’s thoughts and continued, “Doctor Mario, this isn’t your fault. Your motive is for the good of L continent! Don’t worry, I’ll definitely save you!” ”

“As the assistant spoke, he forcefully moved the huge rock that was pressing on Mario’s leg. ”

The huge rock was very big and heavy.

“Mario’s face was deathly pale. Although he could not see the leg under the huge rock, Mario had a feeling that his leg could not be saved. ”

“At this moment, Mario raised his head to look at the assistant. At this moment, his eyes widened. ”

“Mike! Run! Run!”Mario was practically shouting out.

“The assistant still did not understand how Mario had suddenly become like this. He continued to say, “Don’t worry, doctor. I will definitely not leave you behind to escape!” ”

“Run!”Mario extended his hand to push the assistant.

“However, in the next second, the back of the assistant’s neck was grabbed by the strange beast, and his entire body was lifted up. ”

“Mario roared angrily, “Let him go! Let Him Go!” ”

“Under Mario’s gaze, the strange beast tore the assistant into two and swallowed him. ”

The scene was especially terrifying.

It was like a living hell.

“At this moment, no pain could compare to this visual impact. Mario felt as though he was about to suffocate. ”

Why?

Why did he have to experience all of this?

“”Eat me!”Mario shouted at the strange beast, “Eat me!” ”

“Rather than letting him live through all of this pain, it was better to let him die. ”

“However, the strange beast seemed to know what Mario was thinking. It didn’t touch Mario, and even helped him remove the huge rock that was pressed on his leg. ”

“Looking at the colleagues that he had worked with before becoming food for the Strange Beast One by one, Mario’s vision turned black, and he fainted just like that. ”

He didn’t know how much time had passed.

“When Mario woke up again, the massacre was still ongoing. ”

His ears were filled with cries and shouts.

“Mario closed his eyes, his eyes filled with pain. ”

Why.

Why wasn’t this over?

“”Buddy!”At this moment, a pleasantly surprised voice sounded by his ear. ”

Mario turned his head and saw that it was William.

“William had long since lost his usual appearance. His face was covered in dust and dirt, and there were even visible traces of blood on the left side of his face. ”

“He had searched for Mario for a very long time. He had thought that Mario was already gone, but he had not expected that Mario was still alive! ”

“”Buddy, Can You Walk Now?”William asked. ”

Mario nodded. “I should be able to.”

William lowered his voice. “Then let me help you up.”

“When Mario thought about what had happened to his assistant, he suddenly pushed William away. “Leave! Don’t bother about me!” ”

He would implicate William.

William was taken aback. He had never expected Mario to have such a reaction.

“”Buddy, What’s wrong? I’m here to bring you away!”William continued, “I know that you’re feeling very sad right now. I’m just like you. I’m also feeling very sad! “The most important thing for us now is to find the weakness of the exotic beasts and completely destroy them!” ”

“After saying that, William continued, “I’ve observed them. These exotic beasts rest about every three hours. It’s their rest time now. Let’s Go!” ”

“Hearing this, Mario’s expression changed. ”

William immediately helped Mario Up. “Let’s Go!”

“One of Mario’s legs was injured, and he limped as he walked. ”

“Very quickly, the two of them arrived at the base’s emergency shelter. ”

There were many people gathered in the shelter.

“Seeing Mario and William come over, everyone’s gazes were a little strange, with some hatred. ”
