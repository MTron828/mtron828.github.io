“Judging from ye Zao’s appearance, he shouldn’t be someone difficult to get along with. ”

“As long as she spoke properly, ye Zao would definitely agree. ”

“Chen Siyao smiled at ye Zao and continued, “Miss Ye, actually, I invited you out this time because I have a favor to ask of you.” ”

“”Please speak, Miss Chen,”ye Zao said. ” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Chen Siyao looked at ye Zao and continued speaking, “Miss Ye, to be honest with you, Shiyu and I have been childhood sweethearts since we were young. We love each other, especially me. For the sake of Shiyu, I would do anything. “But we’re both too strong. No one is willing to break through that layer of window paper. “Seeing that we’ve reached the age where we’re suitable for marriage, I want to ask Miss Ye for a favor. I want to pull some strings and help this couple with a lover.” ”

“Chen Siyao was deeply in love with song Shiyu, so she naturally knew how much song Shiyu Loved Ye Zao. ”

“If song Shiyu hadn’t loved ye Zao so much, he wouldn’t have said those words in front of her. ”

“So, as long as ye Zao spoke up personally, Song Shiyu would definitely accept her! ”

“If it wasn’t for ye Zao pulling strings, Chen Siyao would never have asked ye Zao out. ”

“Hearing this, ye Zao frowned and looked at Chen Siyao, “Miss Chen, I think you’ve misunderstood something. Brother song and I only met once this year. The relationship between us isn’t at the level where we can be matchmakers.” ”

“Although ye Zao was generous and didn’t want to be calculative, this didn’t mean that she could make others use her. ”

Chen Siyao’s meaning was very obvious.

“”Miss Ye,”Chen Siyao smiled, she continued, “I didn’t mean that. Actually, the relationship between me and Shiyu has already formed naturally. It’s just that I’m lacking a person who can see the sun through the clouds. When the two of us have a successful relationship, I definitely won’t forget you, the matchmaker.” ”

“”Miss Chen, since it’s already formed naturally, I believe that even without the help of others, you and Brother Song will definitely be able to get together.” ”

Chen Siyao didn’t expect ye Zao to reject her twice in a row.

“Under normal circumstances, shouldn’t ye Zao Smile and Nod his head in agreement? ”

It was said that Miss Ye was understanding and was the pillar of the country.

“Today, when they met, Miss Ye was only so-so! ”

Mentioning it in front of song Shiyu was a piece of cake for ye Zao. It was also a merit to be able to achieve a marriage.

“”Miss Ye.”Chen Siyao poured a cup of tea for ye Zao, “You still don’t know Shiyu very well. Shiyu’s personality is a little stubborn. There are some things that need someone to throw a brick to attract the jade. Otherwise, he will forever hide in his own world, unwilling to come out.” ”

“”I don’t know him as well as Miss Chen,”ye Zao continued. “I don’t have much experience in matchmaking. Miss Chen, you’d better find someone else.” ”

“With that, Ye Zhuo stood up from his chair. “I’m sorry, Miss Chen. I still have something to do. I’ll be leaving first.” ”

“With that, Ye Zhuo picked up a banknote and placed it under the cup. “Tea money.” ”

Chen Siyao looked at ye Zhuo’s back and narrowed her eyes.

Ye Zhuo’s reaction was too unexpected.

She thought that ye Zhuo would agree to her request out of respect. She didn’t expect ye Zhuo to reject her outright!

He didn’t give her any face at all.

On the other side.

The assistant immediately reported the incident at the coffee shop to Song Shiyu.

“Hearing this, song Shiyu raised his eyes slightly. “Is that so?” ”

“The assistant nodded. “Yes. I, I also heard Miss Chen asking Miss ye to pull the strings.” ”

PA

“At that moment, a crisp sound came from the air. ”

The assistant turned around and saw that song Shiyu had broken a pen forcefully.

“Very good.”Song Shiyu stood up from his chair. “Chen Siyao has improved.”
