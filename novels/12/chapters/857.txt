“Chapter 858: 191: stunning everyone, group up (Third Watch)1”

“Okay.”

Yin Wei brought ye Zhuo into the courtyard.

“At this moment, song Chenyu and Lu Qi walked over as well. ”

“Yin Wei immediately introduced ye zhuo, “Ye, this is song Chenyu, and this is Lu Qi. Chenyu, Lu Qi, this is our last guest today, Miao Yin’s live streamer Ye.” ”

Lu Qi looked up and was stunned.

Ye Zhuo was very different from the internet celebrity he had imagined.

“In his memory, internet celebrities had scary snake-like faces and heavy makeup. ”

“However, the girl in front of him had a plain face and didn’t even put on lipstick. She was so beautiful that she could topple cities. ”

Her features were like a painting.

Beijing was more than two thousand miles away from here.

A five-hour flight and a three-hour drive would exhaust a normal person after getting off the car.

Even a goddess like song Chenyu had a tired expression on her face when she first arrived.

“However, ye Zao did not look tired at all. Instead, his entire body emitted a youthful and lively aura! ”

A slender and fair waist was hidden in the tassel. It was faintly discernible and especially eye-catching.

“Song Chenyu’s gaze swept across Lu Qi’s face. He looked at Ye Zhuo and said in surprise, “Miss Ye!” ”

“Miss Song.”Ye Zhuo nodded politely.

“Lu Qi asked with some confusion, “Chenyu, do you guys know each other?” ”

“Song Chenyu nodded and said with a smile, “Yes, we’ve met a few times before, but before that, I didn’t know that the program team invited a guest to be Miss Ye.” ”

“Hearing this, Lu Qi frowned slightly. ”

“Ye Zao clearly knew song Chenyu, yet he pretended not to know her. He actually wanted song Chenyu to greet her first. ”

“Here, Song Chenyu was a senior and even a teacher! ”

Ye Zao was just an Internet celebrity.

What right did she have to let song Chenyu greet her first?

She was really too arrogant!

Did she really think that she could enter the entertainment industry just because of her face?

“If a small internet celebrity acted like this in front of a senior, she would be ruined sooner or later! ”

“A look of disgust flashed across Lu Qi’s eyes. She looked at ye Zao and said, “Hello.” ”

“Hello.”

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “It’s very hot outside today. Let’s quickly come in and talk. We just made lemon honey water. Miss Ye, can you drink something sour?” ”

“Thank you. I don’t have any dietary restrictions.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

The four of them talked as they walked into the courtyard.

“At this time, Wei Xingzhi and the other two male celebrities also walked out of the room. ”

“Yin Wei introduced ye Zao to Wei Xingzhi, Wang Xuancheng, and Chang Yu. ”

The three of them originally thought that ye Zao was a staff member.

They didn’t expect that ye Zao was actually that Internet celebrity.

“For a moment, everyone had different expressions. ”

“Other than Wei Xingzhi, the rest of the people present were around the same age. Therefore, after they got to know each other, other than calling Wei Xingzhi teacher Wei, everyone else addressed each other by name. ”

“The program team’s director walked out at the right time. “Now that everyone is here, let me announce our mission for today and the rules of the small courtyard.” ”

“There’s still a mission?”

“What Mission?”

“”It can’t be that kind of perverted mission, right?” ”

Everyone discussed and was very curious.

“The director continued, “For the first mission, there are a total of eight of us, four boys and four girls. Now, these eight people need to form a team and split into two groups. Now, please form your own groups.” ”

“”This side is the red group, and this side is the blue group. Those who want to join the Blue Group, stand to the left, and those who want to join the red group, stand to the left.” ”

Form their own groups?

Song Chenyu’s lips curled up without a trace.

She really liked this kind of model.

“Before coming to the program team, she had understood the rules. ”

This was a self-sufficient show where everything had to be done by oneself.

“A rich young lady like Ye Zhuo, who knew nothing at all, was just waiting to be ridiculed! ”

And she would become the most dazzling one among everyone.

“”I like Blue.”Song Chenyu stood to the left. “I’ll join the Blue Team. If any of you want to be in my team, you can stand over here by yourselves!” ”

“Song Yiwan immediately walked over to song Chenyu’s side and held his arm. “Chenyu, we’ll be in your team.” ”

Lu Qi immediately followed. “I’ll join you too.”

“Count me in.”Wang Xuan Cheng also joined Song Chenyu’s team.

“Chang Yu had wanted to join the blue team too, but he was too late. ”

“Yin Wei held ye Zhuo’s hand. “Ye, let’s team up then.” ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Alright.”

The two of them stood on the red team’s side.

Wei Xingzhi turned to look at Chang Yu. “Then let’s join the red team too.”

“In fact, compared to joining the red team, both of them wanted to join song Chenyu’s team more. ”

“After all, Song Chenyu was a topic of discussion and traffic. ”

Who would want to be in the same team as an internet celebrity?

“Besides, for someone like ye Zhuo, it was obvious that she was a Missy who could not be lifted or shouldered. ”

“Moreover, Ye Zhuo had entered through the back door. ”

How could you expect a person who entered through the back door to have any real knowledge?

The program team of “Country”had many tasks that required the team to complete.

“When that time came, Ye Zhuo would only become a burden for everyone. He might even be blacklisted by the team. ”

“Apart from Yin Wei, Wei Xingzhi and Chang Yu were both worried. ”

“After the team was divided into groups, the director continued, “Okay, in the next week, the people in your two groups will have to fend for themselves and be self-sufficient.” ”

“”What do you mean by self-sufficient, director?”Lu Qi asked. ”

“The director explained, “I believe that when you first entered the village, you already had a simple understanding of the situation in the courtyard. Currently, there are a total of two cows and six chickens in our courtyard. “In this week, two cows and six chickens need to be fed by your two teams.” ”

“”In other words, each team will have one cow and three chickens, right?”Wei Xingzhi had been cheated badly last season. He had learned from his mistakes. This season, he had to ask more clearly. ”

“Yes.”The director nodded.

“Then how do we feed them?”Song Yiwan raised her hand and asked.

“The director said, “There is fresh white grass on the back slope. You can cut it and feed the cows. For the chickens, you can find insects or exchange it with our program team to feed the chickens.” ”

“Exchange? With what?”

“”Exchange it with equivalent labor.”The director continued, “See the watermelon field in front of us? “The watermelon is now ripe. Fifty catties of watermelon can be exchanged for ten yuan, and the chicken feed is exactly ten yuan per catty. “Besides the chicken feed, you can also exchange for other things.” ” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Chang Yu frowned slightly. “Then we will feed these two cows and six chickens. Who will be responsible for our food, clothing, and accommodation?” ”

“”In a while, we’ll arrange rooms for the two of you. As for your meals, there are two kitchens over there. You can cook whatever you want to eat. “There’s a vegetable plot in front of us. We’re self-sufficient in vegetables and meat products. If you need to exchange watermelon for money, our program team will exchange it.” ”

“Cook by yourself?”

“I don’t know how to Cook!”

“”F * ck, I don’t know how to cook either!” ”

“With that, everyone lost their composure. ”

“They were all big stars. Usually, they were busy with filming and catching up on work, so how would they have time to cook? ”

“To use a phrase to describe it, ”

they did not know how to differentiate between the four bodies and the five grains.

“If they were to let them cook by themselves, wouldn’t the program team be causing trouble? ”

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “Don’t worry about cooking. Just leave it to me.” ”

“When they heard that song Chenyu knew how to cook, everyone immediately heaved a sigh of relief. They looked at song Chenyu as if they were looking at their savior. “Chenyu, you’re too amazing! You actually know how to Cook!” ”

“Song Chenyu said, “Back then, when I came to Beijing on my own, I even stayed in the basement. It was just cooking. It was very simple.”Not only did she know how to cook, but she was also very good at it! ”

Song Chenyu did not expect that her culinary skills would come in handy on the show.

She was now very glad that she had learned how to cook from the chef.

“Nowadays, female celebrities who knew how to cook in the entertainment industry were rarer than pandas. ”

“When the time came, she would definitely be able to use this opportunity to attract a huge amount of fans. ”

“Song Yiwan hugged song Chenyu’s arm. “Chenyu, I really admire you!” ”

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “It’s just cooking. It’s not that serious.” ”

On team Red’s side.

“Yin Wei was born into a good family. She had never even entered the kitchen, let alone cooked. ”

“Chang Yu and Wei Xingzhi, the two big men, were even worse at cooking. ”

A gentleman would stay away from the kitchen.

Cooking in the kitchen was too easy to ruin a person’s image.

“At this moment, everyone was very envious of Team Blue. ”

“Looking at song Chenyu, one could tell that she was a girl who was both beautiful and intelligent. Her cooking skills were definitely not bad. ”

The members of team blue were in for a treat.

“Seeing that everyone was in a difficult position, Ye Zhuo stood up and said, “Then I’ll cook for us here.” ”

“Yin only a little surprised to see ye Zhuo, “Ye you can cook?” ”
