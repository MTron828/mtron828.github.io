Therefore.

The police must not find out about Mike’s matter.

“After thinking for a while, father Zhao continued, “Why don’t you go abroad and hide First!” ”

“There was no need to be afraid, just in case. ”

“Father Zhao had finally found his biological son, and he had not enjoyed the happiness of having children and grandchildren. He did not want to take such a risk! ”

“”No need,”Mike directly refused. ”

The person who could threaten him in China was not even born yet!

The police wanted to find him?

It was simply a fantasy!

“Mike had been in the industry for so many years, but he had never met anyone who could match him. ”

It was unnecessary to go out to avoid him.

“Seeing Mike so confident, father Zhao was even more worried. He continued, “There is a saying in China that says, ‘a ship sailed with caution for ten thousand years.’you’d better go out and hide!” ”

Carelessness lost Jingzhou.

Father Zhao was a very cautious person!

“”Mr. Zhao,”mike chuckled, “When did you become so timid?” ”

“”It’s not that I’m timid, but that ye Zhuo is too powerful!”Father Zhao said. ”

He had a hunch.

Ye Zhuo would definitely intervene in this matter.

“Once ye Zhuo appeared, this matter would definitely become very troublesome. ”

“With Ye Zao’s character, he would definitely not stop until the murderer was found. ”

Only when Mike left could he be completely at ease.

“Who is ye Zao?”A curious look appeared in Mike’s eyes.

“To be able to make father Zhao so fearful, it was definitely not simple! ”

“”She is a very powerful person,”father Zhao continued, “You still don’t know, right? Ye Zao saved my son! Didn’t you say that no one can cure your poison?” ”

“When he heard Mike’s words, Father Zhao was completely dumbfounded! ”

Fortunately.

“Fortunately, ye Zao saved Ye Sen. ”

“Hearing that, Mike on the other end of the phone was stunned. ”

Ye Zao cured him of his poison?

How was that possible! Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“He himself couldn’t cure his poison, but a Chinese could? ”

It couldn’t be!

“After a moment, Mike finally reacted and asked, “Are you sure that she cured me of my poison?” ”

“”I’m sure!”Father Zhao continued, “So you should quickly go abroad to hide. If ye Zhuo finds out about it, we’ll all be finished!” ”

Murder for hire.

International Assassin.

Any one of these two charges could put him in prison for life.

“Is ye Sen awake now?”Mike asked.

“Father Zhao continued, “Although he hasn’t woken up yet, Ye Zhuo said that the surgery went very smoothly!” ”

“”So he hasn’t woken up yet,”Mike said. ”

“What do you mean?”Father Zhao’s heart skipped a beat.

“Mike continued, “I still say the same thing. Even I can’t cure my poison. Do you think a Chinese can?” ”

It wasn’t that Mike looked down on Chinese people.

It was just the nature of Chinese people.

“So, the poison in Ye Sen’s body had not been cured? ”

“Hearing this, Father Zhao frowned. ”

“Ten minutes ago, Father Zhao was still extremely excited about the success of the surgery. ”

“Now, it was as if someone had hit him in the head and poured a basin of cold water on him. His entire body was cold. ”

What should he do?

“At this moment, Father Zhao’s voice was trembling. “Then, then you mean... my son... he...” ”

Father Zhao couldn’t say the rest.

No!

He didn’t believe it was true.

“”Mr. Zhao, I’m busy now. I’ll hang up first.”Mike hung up the phone. ”

Father Zhao’s face was pale.

“After a long while, Father Zhao finally reacted and walked to the ward area. ”

“Ye Sen had been pushed to the ward, but because of the anesthetic, he hadn’t woken up yet. Lying on the bed, he didn’t have much life left. ”

“Seeing ye Sen like this, Father Zhao’s face turned even paler. ”

Could it be that ye Zao’s surgery was really useless to Ye Sen?

“Father Zhao held onto the door frame, unable to lift his body. ”

“”Master, the young master is fine now. You should eat something first.” ”

“Because he was worried about ye Sen, Father Zhao had not eaten much for the whole day. ”

“I’m not hungry.”Father Zhao waved his hand.

“The butler continued, “A man is like iron rice or steel. If you don’t eat, you’ll be hungry. Even if it’s for the young master, you should at least eat a little.” ”

Father Zhao’s health was not good to begin with.

“If he did not eat, his body would definitely collapse. ”

“I already said I’m not eating!”Father Zhao waved his hand and directly knocked the food on the ground.

The Butler was shocked.

What happened?

“Logically speaking, Father Zhao should be very happy that Ye Sen’s surgery went so smoothly. ”

Why didn’t he look happy at all?
