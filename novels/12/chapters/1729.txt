“The next second, director Ma was devastated! ”

“The giant pulled director Ma’s hands and feet, tore him into two halves, and threw him out. ”

Terrifying!

It was too terrifying!

“Director Ma’s eyes widened, and his pupils kept contracting. ”

“Director Ma! Let’s Go!”Jack grabbed director Ma’s wrist and rushed into the spaceship with all his might.

Quick!

Very fast!

“Jack was a trained professional astronaut. At this moment, he used the fastest speed in his life. ”

Speed of life and death.

“The third giant saw the thoughts of the two people and stretched out its claws, wanting to grab them. ”

Jack pulled Professor Ma and rushed into the cabin door with all his might!

“The moment the giant was about to grab the two people, it closed the cabin door! ”

Bang!

This scene was recorded by the camera flying in the air and transmitted to Earth.

The higher-ups of the Cen family base were all stunned.

“Cen Hai pointed at the big screen and said, “Oh, my God! There really are mutants!” ”

“”It seems like Miss Ye’s decision wasn’t wrong! If Miss Ye didn’t stop us from going to Europa, we would be the ones torn in half right now! Professor Feng is really miserable. But she deserves it!” ”

“If it weren’t for Professor Feng digging his own grave, how would things have turned out like this? ”

“Cen Hu looked at Gu si. “Gu si, do you have anything to say now?” ”

“Gu Si lowered her head, her face red. “I, I was wrong. I’ll apologize to Miss Ye.” ”

Elder sun was still unable to react. He still couldn’t believe that Professor Feng had been torn in half by the mutants.

That scene.

It was so bloody that elder sun almost vomited his last meal.

The live bullet screen was also very interesting.

[ why did those people who said our father y disappear? ]

[ it’s just some monsters. The attack equipment on the spaceship is not bad either! Hurry up and attack. ]

“[ I think the best way is to return to Earth! ]! [ we still have to check if the spaceship is occupied by monsters, we must not bring the monsters back to Earth! ]! Dr. YC said that once the mutants were brought back to Earth, it would be a disaster for the Humans! ] ”

“[ right, right, right! You must check carefully! If this kind of monster is really brought back to Earth, it will definitely mutate! ] ”

[ come on! The people of C Nation are praying for you! You can definitely regret earth safely. ]

Over here.

“Jack was sitting in the cabin. His face was pale, and bean-sized sweat dripped down from his forehead. His eyes were filled with the ecstasy of having escaped death! ”

The violent heartbeat in his chest reminded him.

Alive.

He was still alive.

“Thinking of this, Jack took a deep breath. ”

Director Ma was stunned.

The scene of professor Feng being torn in half kept appearing in front of his eyes.

He couldn’t even believe it was real.

How could this be!

“If he hadn’t run fast, he would have been the next to be torn apart. ”

Director Ma had never thought that such a fierce xenogeneic was hiding on this seemingly beautiful planet!

Boom!

“At this moment, the spaceship began to shake violently. It was impossible to stand firmly inside. ”

“Director Ma! Director Ma!”The assistant ran over from the cockpit. “The XENOGENEIC is attacking the spaceship. Please give the order immediately!”

Director Ma was stunned for two seconds before he reacted. “Launch a nuclear bomb to attack them!”

“Before this, C country was a big weapon country. The nuclear weapons on the spaceship were all the most advanced nuclear weapons. Although they could not be compared to the weapons on the lightspeed aircraft carrier, it was not a problem to kill a few xenogeneics. ”

“After all, one of their nuclear bombs could directly blow up a small island! ”

“Roger!”

The assistant immediately got the attack team into combat mode.

Rumble —

The spaceship started to fly into the air and slowly flew into the air.

It flew until it was about 500 meters above the ground before it stopped.

The three giant creatures looked at the spaceship stopping in the air and were very anxious. They walked around on the ground as if they were discussing how to shoot the spaceship down.

“Through the camera, looking at the movements of the three mutants on the ground, director Ma narrowed his eyes. “This day next year will be the anniversary of your death! Launch!” ”

“Yes!”

Boom!

A nuclear bomb was launched.

Bang!

The nuclear bomb exploded into a sea of fire.

Hiss —

The miserable screams of the giant creatures came from underground.

Director ma curled the corners of his lips. “A bunch of animals! I thought you guys were very powerful! But it turns out that you are just so-so!”Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m
