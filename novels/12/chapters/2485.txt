Everything was so beautiful.

“She knew that song Shiyu would definitely come, ”

the corners of Chen Siyao’s mouth curled up into a faint smile.

“The next morning, Little Xu went to the second floor as usual to deliver breakfast to Chen Siyao. ”

“Suddenly, a scream cut across the entire sky. ”

“Ah!”

Following that was the sound of an ambulance.

“Chen Siyao was put on the ambulance, but before the car reached the hospital, the electrocardiogram on the car had already stopped beating. ”

Chen Siyao left with her eyes closed and a line of muddy tears streaked across the corner of her eyes.

“At this moment, no one knew if Chen Siyao had any regrets. ”

Maybe she did.

Maybe she would never regret it.

“Little Xu lay on Chen Siyao’s body and cried out loudly, “Miss! Miss!” ”

Yun Jing.

“When the housekeeper received the notification, his face was full of disbelief. He took a few steps back. “Wh-what?” ”

The person on the other end of the phone repeated it again.

The housekeeper frowned. “How could this be!” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

How could this be!

“Although he had expected that bad news would come, he hadn’t expected that the worst news would come. ”

“The Butler did not even have time to hang up the phone. He crawled to Old Master Chen’s bedroom and said, “Old Master! Old Master is in trouble!” ”

“Old Master Chen was sitting on the bed. When he heard the Butler’s voice, he turned around impatiently and asked, “What happened?” ”

“He was already annoyed enough, but the butler still had to make a fuss. No matter who it was, they would not be able to stand it. ”

“The butler knelt on the ground and said with red eyes, “Eldest miss, eldest miss, eldest miss is gone!” ”

Gone?

“Hearing this, Old Master Chen’s expression instantly changed. He immediately sat up straight. “What happened to Yaoyao?” ”

That wouldn’t happen.

Nothing would happen to Chen Siyao!

“The butler continued, “I just received a call from Nanhai. They said that eldest miss didn’t make it through the ambulance on the way to the hospital...” ”

“Before the butler could finish his sentence, Old Master Chen closed his eyes and fainted. ”

“Old Master!”The Butler immediately stood up from the ground.

“He was in a flurry again. Under the Doctor’s help, Old Master Chen finally woke up. ”

“”Old Master, Are You Alright?”The Butler asked. ”

“Old Master Chen held the Butler’s hand tightly. “Tell me, what did you say about Yaoyao?” ”

“The housekeeper didn’t know how to speak. Her lips couldn’t stop trembling, and tears rolled down her cheeks. ”

“Yaoyao!”Old Master Chen roared into the sky.

“The housekeeper continued, “Old Master, I’m sorry for your loss.” ”

Old Master Chen couldn’t believe this fact.

He couldn’t believe that Chen Siyao was already dead.

How could this be!

Why didn’t song Shiyu Stop Chen Siyao?

It was fake.

It had to be fake.

Chen Siyao was the heir to the Chen family. How could something have happened to her? !

“”Yaoyao is fine. Yaoyao is fine.”Old Master Chen looked at the housekeeper and continued, “Housekeeper, you’re joking with me, right?” ”

The housekeeper cried and shook his head. “Old Master...”

He also hoped that this was a joke.

“Unfortunately, it wasn’t. ”

All of this was real.

“”Old Master, you have to hold on! Sir is still waiting for you!”The housekeeper said. ”

“Thinking of Chen You Long in the detention center, Old Master Chen directly vomited a mouthful of blood, “It’s my fault! It’s all my fault! It’s all my fault for indulging him too much!”That was why Chen You Long did such a thing. ”

“Regret, sorrow, sadness, all kinds of emotions mixed together, it was very uncomfortable! ”

“Where’s Yaoyao?”Old Master Chen looked at the butler and asked.

“The Butler wiped away his tears and said, “Eldest miss is currently in the South Sea Hospital’s morgue.” ”

The morgue.

“When he heard these three words, old master Chen’s emotions instantly collapsed. ”

“Chen Siyao was fine, but why was she separated from Yin and Yang Now? ! ”

“Yaoyao! Yaoyao!”Old Master Chen stood up from the bed. “I want to see Yaoyao!”

“The Butler immediately helped Old Master Chen Up. “Old Master, please slow down!” ”

“I want to see Yaoyao.”Old Master Chen’s voice was filled with tears. “Quickly make the arrangements. I want to bring Yaoyao home.”

“Okay! Okay!”The Butler wiped his tears. “I will make the arrangements right away.”

The Butler went to make the arrangements for the private plane. Old Master Chen just sat there paralyzed. There was no light in his eyes anymore.

“Soon, the two of them boarded the plane to Nanhai. ”

“Four hours later, the plane landed. ”

The Butler took old master Chen Straight to the hospital.

It was not until he saw Chen Siyao’s body that old master Chen dared to believe that all of this was true.

Chen Siyao was really dead.
