Chapter 196: 089: Lin Jin city’s secret, brother Ze, the one who dug up the trap, went online in a domineering manner! 2

Aunt Zhao’s broken finger and broken voice were all thanks to her.

“Song Shiyu! You will suffer retribution!”Zheng Xiangyue roared angrily.

“You won’t be able to see my retribution! However, your retribution has already arrived.”Song Shiyu’s lips curled into a faint smile, “Although song Zinian has left, don’t worry. As long as I’m here, I’ll definitely let you live out your old age in peace! I Won’t let you suffer!”

After saying that, song Shiyu turned to look at Aunt Zhao and said gently, “I’ll go back first. Remember to take good care of her.”

Aunt Zhao nodded. “Don’t worry, I will.”

The pain that she had suffered back then, she would return it to this B * tch a hundredfold or a thousand times over!

As song Shiyu walked out, he took off his gloves.

Behind him, Zheng Xiangyue’s painful cries could be heard.

...

The next morning.

Ye Zhuo woke up very early.

After running, Ye Shu had already made breakfast. “Zhuozhuo, mom didn’t make porridge this morning. Can We have milk and oatmeal?”

“Sure.”Ye Zhuo nodded.

......

Ye Shu brought the fried dough sticks to the table and shouted, “Ye Sen! Get Up and eat!”

Ye Zhonghua went to make oatmeal.

When the mother and daughter sat at the dining table and were ready to eat, Ye Sen walked out of the bathroom yawning.

“I slept for three hours last night. I’m so tired! I still have to go to City C on a business trip the day after Tomorrow!”Ye Sen widened his panda eyes and began to dream. “If only cash could fall from the sky and fall on me!”

Ye Zao took a bite of the oatmeal. The Crispy Oatmeal blended with the mellow fragrance of milk and was very delicious. Ye Zao’s mood improved after eating such delicious food in the morning. He continued,

“Uncle, I have a way to help you realize your wish to get some cash from the sky.”

“Really?”Ye Sen’s eyes lit up.

Ye Zao nodded. “You know, I never lie.”

Ye Sen was so excited that he didn’t even eat breakfast. He looked at Ye Zao with anticipation. “What Solution?”

His niece was very capable.

Maybe she really had a solution!

Ye Zao took a bite of the fried dough stick and said unhurriedly, “Actually, the solution is very simple...”

“Hurry up and say it!”Ye Sen couldn’t wait.

“Just be a bastard in the wishing well,”ye Zao said faintly. “Don’t tourists often throw money at the Bastards in The Wishing Well?”

Ye Sen:”...”

How could he forget.

His niece was also a little expert at insulting people!

Ye Shu was overjoyed. “That’s why! You have to be down-to-earth. Don’t keep thinking about those nonsense!”

After saying that, ye Shu continued, “Right, Zao Zao, mom has been a little busy these days. I have to go to city a next week. I’ll probably stay there for about half a month. Can you stay at home alone?”

Because the restaurant’s business was very good, Ye Shu interrupted her plan to open a branch in City A.

A conservative estimate was that she would have to stay there for about half a month.

“No problem,”ye Zhuo replied.

Ye Sen said, “Sister, you can go to city a without worry. I’m still at home! I shouldn’t be so busy next week.”

Ye Shu nodded.

Time passed quickly.

In the blink of an eye, it was ye Shu’s business trip to City A.

Ye Sen and Ye Zhuo sent ye Shu to the airport.

This was the first time ye Shu had traveled so far for such a long time. Inside and outside, everything was fine and detailed. She told the two of them a lot of things, “The plants at home need to be watered every three days, and that little turtle needs to be watered every day. Oh, and...”

Ye Sen replied, “I got it, sis. You’ve said these words no less than thirty times!”

Ever since he woke up in the morning, Ye Shu had been talking about these things. Ye Sen felt as if his ears were going to be callused.

Ye Shu rolled her eyes at him. “I was just afraid that you guys would forget about it, right?”

Ye Sen smiled and said, “Don’t worry. Even if I’ve forgotten about it, I’ll remember it! Time is almost up. Hurry up and go in!”

Seeing that time was indeed running out, ye Shu reluctantly walked towards the boarding gate.

Seeing ye Shu’s figure disappear into the surging crowd in front, ye Sen heaved a sigh of relief. “Your mother is finally willing to leave.” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Uncle, what are we having for lunch?”Ye Zao turned around and looked at Ye Sen.

“Let’s go eat spicy hot soup!”Ye Sen rubbed his hands, excitement flashing in his eyes.

He seemed to have forgotten that ye Shu had just told him not to bring ye Zhuo to eat junk food.

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded.

Although spicy hotpot was a little unhealthy, there was nothing to say about its taste.

...

After eating spicy hotpot, they went home.
