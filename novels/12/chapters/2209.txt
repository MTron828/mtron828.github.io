“Man Jiangshan and his wife were at fault, but as the son of Man Wen, he couldn’t do anything to his biological parents. ”

It was simply treason!

“Not long after, the police station posted a video of the poisoner giving up man Wen on the starnet. ”

“”It’s Man Wen, Man Wen threatened me. I really didn’t mean to harm Mr. and Mrs. Man...”the poisoner cried in front of the camera, begging for a lighter sentence. ”

“For a time, the STAR network was full of complaints about Manwen. ”

“”My God, I never thought that the real culprit behind the scenes was Manwen!” ”

“”Why did Manwen do this? He doesn’t seem to have any motive, right? I feel like there’s a twist in this matter.” ”

“”Who said he doesn’t have a motive?”? “I think he’s trying to protect his position!”! Man Jiangshan and Zhao Dan had many misdeeds. They even threw away their own daughter. Such parents were a great shame to man Wen. Although man Jiangshan and Zhao Dan were sentenced to 10 years, what about 10 years later? Man Wen was now the president of Manxing Country. He would definitely be the same in 10 years! How would man Jiangshan and Zhao Dan face them when they were released after 10 years? ] ”

“”Based on this analysis, man Wen is indeed very suspicious! However, there is one thing that is very strange. Why didn’t that poisoner expose man Wen before? Why did he have to wait until now?” ”

“”Everyone, calm down. Don’t be in a hurry to take sides. I feel that this matter is not that simple. Just like what happened to miss ye before, you have already hurt Miss Ye once. This time, you must be careful.” ”

“[ like father, like son. Man Jiangshan and Zhao Dan abandoned their own daughter. When it was man Wen’s turn, he actually silenced his parents. This father and son are both ruthless people. ] ”

“[ the law is long and thorough. It seems that the sunlight of the masses is bright. Previously, I saw someone speculate that the death of man Jiangshan and his wife was abnormal. It definitely wasn’t as simple as a vendetta. I didn’t expect that they would actually guess correctly! ] ”

[ the Prince committed the same crime as the commoners. I will definitely watch the live broadcast of the trial! ]

[ one more! Remember to poke me when the trial starts! ]

[ justice will never be absent! ]

[ ... ]

“As the president of the Manxing Nation, not only did man Wen not lead by example, but he also tried to break the law. He knew that he had committed the crime, so it was normal for people to be angry. ”

“Under the circumstances of the People’s blood letter, Man Wen was officially arrested by the police department. ”

“At this time, it had been less than three days since he became president. ”

He was probably the president who had been in office for the shortest time in history.

“With Manman’s arrest, the task of supervising the country naturally fell to Manxing. ”

“After all, Manxing had done well in the election and was ranked second. ”

“If Manman was convicted, Manxing would naturally become the 190th president of Manxing. ”

Manxing sat in the President’s office with a smile on her face.

“Before implementing the plan, she had already taken care of everything and destroyed all the evidence. As long as the person who poisoned him insisted that Manwen was the one who ordered him to do it, Manwen’s life would be over. ”

“Not only that, Manwen would also be sentenced to death! ”

“Thinking that Manwen was about to be sentenced to death, Manxing’s lips curled up. ”

She wanted to see how ye Zhuo would protect man Wen this time.

“”Xing ‘er,”master Cao walked in from outside. “The people on the star network are very angry. As the acting president, you should speak up. I have already drafted the manuscript for you.” ”

Master Cao handed the manuscript to man Xing.

“Man Xing took the manuscript and nodded. “Yes, master, I understand.” ”

“Man Wen was his biological younger brother, and man Jiangshan and Zhao Dan were her biological mothers. If something like this happened, others would definitely avoid it. ”

But Man Xing would not.

She was the best at using retreat to advance.

“”Oh right, master,”man Xing continued, “I heard that Zhao Shan Dong was locked up by man Wen?” ”

“Yes.”Master Cao nodded.

Man Xing narrowed his eyes. “Man Wen read the books?”

“”Yes.”Master Cao continued, “Zhao Shan Dong’s appetite isn’t small either. He actually swallowed two billion behind our backs!” ”

“I didn’t expect that Trash Man Wen to have this ability.”Man Xing frowned slightly. “There’s still a use for me to keep him. I need to think of a way to bail him out.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“The national treasury deficit was not a matter of Zhao Shan Dong alone. If the investigation continued, it would sooner or later implicate her! ”

“Man Xing originally thought that she would quietly settle this matter once she became the president. However, Man Wen interfered midway. What was even more unexpected was that man Wen was actually able to find out that the bill was abnormal, fortunately, she was still sitting at the top of the Manxing nation. ”
