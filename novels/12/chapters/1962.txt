“Hearing this, the He family’s parents in the ward immediately stood up. “Aunt Yaoyao.” ” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Xu Chaonan politely said, “Mr. he and Mrs. He.” ”

“Mother he said, “Aunt Yaoyao, please sit down. I’ll pour you some tea.” ”

Xu Chaonan directly rejected him. “No need. I’m here to talk to Yaoyao.”

“After saying that, Xu Chaonan looked at Xu Yao. “Yaoyao, come with me.” ”

Xu Yao hesitated for a moment before following Xu Chaonan’s footsteps.

The He family’s parents looked at each other. They could see the worry and worry in each other’s eyes.

What was Xu Chaonan doing at this juncture?

What did she want to say to Xu Yao?

Xu Yao followed Xu Chaonan to the corridor outside the hospital.

“This was the VIP Ward area, so there weren’t many people here. Compared to the normal ward area, it was much quieter. ”

“Xu Yao looked at Xu Chaonan. “Auntie, what do you have to say to me?” ”

Xu Chaonan looked at Xu Yao’s stomach. “How many months has it been?”

“”Two and a half months,”Xu Yao replied. ”

“”Abort it,”Xu Chaonan continued. ”

“Hearing this, Xu Yao raised her head in surprise. ”

She didn’t expect Xu Chaonan to come here to talk about this.

“Unlike the Xu Parents’acting, Xu Chaonan’s eyes were filled with seriousness. ”

She really came here to ask Xu Yao to abort it.

“Xu Chaonan continued, “Yaoyao, you’re still young. You Don’t know what raising a child means to you! A child is not an object, not a toy, not even a pet.” ”

“”As long as you choose to give birth to him, you have to be responsible for him.” ”

“Xu Yao had not even grown up, how could she raise a child? ”

“Of course, Xu Yao could not reveal her true motive to Xu Chaonan. Xu Chaonan was a good prude! ”

“If she knew her true motive, Xu Chaonan would definitely criticize her harshly. ”

He might even interrupt her plan.

“Xu Yao raised her head to look at Xu Chaonan and said seriously, “Auntie, I know what I’m saying. I also know that a child can not be raised with just words. Don’t worry, I will be responsible for my own child.” ”

What she meant was that she would not let outsiders worry about her.

Xu Chaonan had no right to criticize her!

“Xu Chaonan frowned slightly. “Yaoyao, you’re too impulsive!” ”

“”Aunty, I’m not impulsive. I’ve thought about this for a long time. I want to give birth to this child.”Xu Yao noticed the faint footsteps in the air, she continued, “Ziteng is lying on the bed now. Even though I’m hoping for a miracle to happen every day, I know in my heart that a miracle can never happen! Ziteng can only lie on the bed for the rest of his life!” ”

“At this point, Xu Yao paused and continued: ”

“”If anything happens to ziteng, then the child in my stomach is uncle and Auntie’s only hope. One can not be so selfish. I can not take away uncle and Auntie’s only hope!” ”

The person listening from the corner not far away was none other than mother he.

It was mother he.

“Hearing this, mother he’s eyes turned red again. ”

She was not wrong about Xu Yao.

Mother he wiped her tears and turned around to walk towards the ward.

“When he saw mother he return, father he immediately stood up from the sofa. “How was it? What did Xu Chaonan say to Yaoyao?” ”

Mother he told father he what she had heard.

“When he heard this, father he was very touched. ”

“Yaoyao is really a good girl. Our Ziteng’s judgment is not wrong.”

Mother he nodded.

“He ziteng, who was on the hospital bed, was very sad. ”

He was shouting silently.

“”Dad, Mom, don’t be fooled by Xu Yao! She’s acting! Acting!” ”

“Unfortunately, his parents couldn’t hear this kind of silent shouting at all. ”

“In the past few days, he ziteng had to endure the torment of Xu Yao and Mi Chen, this pair of dog lovers. ”

The feeling of being helpless was too unbearable.

“Through their conversation, he ziteng knew that Xu Yao and Mi Chen were high school classmates. They were each other’s first love. ”

“When Xu Yao was with him, she was no longer a virgin. ”

She only went over to make up for it once.

“He ziteng was now looking forward to Ye Zao’s experiment as soon as possible. As long as ye Zao’s experiment ended, he would be able to regain his freedom. ”

He wanted to personally tear apart the true colors of Xu Yao and Mi Chen!

He wanted to make the two of them pay the price they deserved!

Outside.

“Xu Chaonan spoke a lot of heartfelt words, but Xu Yao did not listen to a single word he said. ”

She still insisted on giving birth to this child.

“”Yaoyao, you will regret it.”Xu Chaonan looked at Xu Yao. ”
