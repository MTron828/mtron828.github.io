“Although they were of different races, they were all Earthlings! ”

“Dr. Zhang turned to look at Ye Zao. “Miss Ye, I’ll go and make an announcement right now. Tell those people not to go in anymore!” ”

“”Go ahead,”said ye Zao. ”

Dr. Zhang immediately turned around and ran to his office.

He had to make an announcement right away!

“Soon, Dr. Zhang had the international department draft out a notice. ”

The notice carefully explained the current situation of the exotic beast.

“When Mario saw the notice, his eyes were filled with disdain. “I really overestimated YC!” ”

“He had thought that ye Zao was very open and aboveboard, but he had not expected that ye Zao would actually do such a thing. ”

What was this called?

There was an idiom in China called ‘backstabbing’.

Ye Zao was backstabbing!

“Professor William looked at the notice carefully and continued, “Buddy, it says here that there’s more than one Lucy! A mutant Beast’s reproductive ability is exceptionally strong. It’s not a viviparous species. It can split into 100 to 200 at a Time!” ”

“If this was true, that would be too terrifying! ”

“”It’s just scaremongering!”Mario didn’t take this matter to heart. “Don’t you understand what YC is trying to do? She’s trying to confuse us, trying to make us fall into chaos from within!” ”

Did she really think that they were that easy to fool?

What a joke!

“Professor William frowned as he looked at Mario and continued, “But what if it’s true?” ”

“”Don’t worry, it can’t be true!”Mario continued, “If Lucy can really classify dozens or even hundreds of offspring at one go, then what about the other exotic beasts? There are traces left behind by humans and sounds left behind by geese. They are huge in size, so they should be noticed! “But have you received any reports?” ”

“Ye Zao said that there were at least a few hundred exotic beasts in L continent. No matter how one looked at it, it seemed impossible! ”

Doctor William shook his head.

He had never received any reports before. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Mario continued, “So, you don’t have to worry about this nonsense.” ”

“After saying that, Mario looked at his assistant and asked, “How is the situation outside? has everyone been affected by this nonsense?” ”

The country was people-oriented.

“If the people of L continent were affected by these words, then Mario would have to come up with a corresponding strategy. ”

“The assistant looked at Mario and said respectfully, “No, the people trust you very much. Don’t worry.” ”

“Hearing this, Mario nodded his head in satisfaction. ”

“Now, all he had to do was wait for the Exotic Beasts to help him build an aircraft carrier that surpassed China’s. ”

“When that time came, he would definitely cause a sensation all over the world! ”

“Thinking of this, Mario’s eyes were filled with a proud light. From the looks of it, it seemed like he had already seen victory. ”

The next day.

“Just as Mario arrived at the entrance of the base, an ear-piercing alarm suddenly sounded in the air. ”

“Beep, BEEP, Beep — ”

The alarm sounded from all directions.

What was going on?

Was there an earthquake?

Mario immediately ran to the office. “What’s going on?”

“Seeing Mario come over, the originally dazed assistant immediately found his backbone and anxiously said, “Professor, not good! There’s been a large number of exotic beast attacks in the southern region. Currently, 200 people have gone missing!” ”

“In the next second, the office door was knocked open by someone. A person dressed in a black suit ran in from outside and panted as he said, “Professor, the Northern Region has also been attacked by exotic beasts...” ”

“Just as he finished speaking, Professor William ran over. “Old friend! This is bad! Groups of exotic beasts have appeared in Jiaonan, and there are signs of an attack!” ”

“Doctor...”

“It was unknown when, but a group of exotic beasts had suddenly appeared in L continent. ”

“They had three heads and five legs, and their entire bodies were covered in disgusting mucus. They could even spew fire and create lightning. Everywhere they went, it was a complete mess! ”

“At present, L continent had been severely affected by the disaster, to the point where it was impossible to estimate. ”

“Faced with such a sudden situation, Mario was completely dumbfounded. ”

What was going on?

“”Doctor, please think of something! The exotic beasts are rushing towards our laboratory from all directions! !” ”

“Doctor...”

“Mario tried his best to calm himself down. Raising his hand, he said, “Gather all the high-ranking personnel and start the meeting immediately!” ”

“Five minutes later, everyone gathered in the meeting room. ”

“Through his sinister eyes, Mario saw the appearance of the strange beasts. In the blink of an eye, his face turned pale. ”

“How, how could this be? ”

“Mario, who originally had a sliver of hope, had lost all hope at this moment. ”

This was because these strange beasts were just like Lucy.

They were exactly the same.

Mario turned to look at his assistant. “Is Lucy still here?”

“The assistant lowered his head to look at the monitor, his eyes filled with disbelief. “She was clearly here just a moment ago. Why is she not here now!” ”

Mario immediately stood up from his chair. “She’s not here anymore?”

The assistant nodded.

“Mario immediately said, “Get someone to prepare the potash bombs immediately!” ”

The moment he said that.

Bang!

“After a loud bang, two people fell from the roof. ”

The roof had also been smashed through!

“One had to know that the roof of the experimental base was made of special materials. Even if an armored vehicle fell from the sky, it would not be able to smash through the roof. ”

“But now, the roof had actually been smashed through! ”

Mario raised his head to look.

“When he saw this, he was immediately dumbfounded. A three-headed monster was currently lowering its head to observe the humans inside. ”

“Run!”Mario shouted loudly.

“In an instant, the people in the room ran away. ”

“Shrieks and cries rang out. Upstairs and downstairs, it was a chaotic mess. It was especially terrifying. ”

The scene was comparable to the scene of a disaster film.

“Whether it was in the experimental base or the experimental base, there were monsters that were chasing away humans everywhere. There was nowhere for them to run! ”

“Under Mario’s command, everyone threw their potash bombs at the exotic beasts. They originally thought that the exotic beasts would disappear just like that. ”

But...

They didn’t!

Those potash bombs didn’t react at all when they were thrown at the exotic beasts.

How could this be?

Mario’s face turned pale. These exotic beasts were clearly afraid of potash.

Why weren’t they afraid now?

PA!

“At this moment, a huge beast swept over with a slap. ”

“Mario was sent flying by the slap, before landing heavily on the ground. ”

“Pu!”Mario spat out a mouthful of blood.
