“Ye Zao raised his eyes slightly and said with a smile, “You made the dessert so delicious. What does it matter even if you are a little fat?” ”

There was no dessert master who did not like to be praised for his culinary skills.

“Hearing this, the master’s face was full of smiles. “Since you like to eat so much, I will show you my specialty, Dessert Mont-blanc!” ”

This dessert was usually served in a limited edition Michelin restaurant.

Only three servings were made every day.

Today’s reservation was already scheduled for next year.

Ye Zhuo’s eyes lit up. “Great! I’m looking forward to it!”

The master began to make dessert on the spot. Ye Zhuo waited for the dessert while chatting with him.

“Through chatting, Ye Zhuo learned that the master’s surname was Wu. ”

He was Chinese.

“Not long after, the legendary Dessert Mont-blanc was ready. ”

Master Wu brought it to Ye Zhuo.

“Try it.”

“It had an exquisite appearance, and it looked very delicious! ”

“Ye Zhuo picked up a spoon and took a bite. The taste was slightly sweet, and the mellowness of the chocolate instantly spread on the tip of his tongue. It was sweet but not greasy. “Delicious! Too Delicious! Master Wu, your craftsmanship is superb!” ”

Master Wu was very happy to be praised.

Cen Shaoqing had just come down from upstairs when he saw ye Zhuo sitting there eating dessert.

“Moreover, she was chatting with the dessert maker while eating. ”

She seemed to be quite happy chatting with him.

“In her memory, she seemed to be able to chat with anyone. ”

“First, she had an old friend with old Mrs. Cen. ”

“Then, she addressed Zhou Xiang as a sister. ”

“Now, she was actually chatting so happily with a dessert maker. ”

“If this was any other person, they probably wouldn’t be as easy-going as she was. ”

“After all, when old madam Cen knew her at that time. ”

She was just a beggar who didn’t have anything

“Cen Shaoqing just stood there, holding a string of Buddhist beads in his hand. There was a trace of coldness in his abstinence, and his entire body emitted a domineering aura that caused people to be unable to catch up to him. ”

“This caused everyone to turn around and look at the Prime Minister, and they all guessed who this was. ”

Mu Yourong discovered Cen Shaoqing at the first moment.

“Moreover, she discovered that Cen Shaoqing was looking in her direction. ”

Cen Shaoqing was looking at her!

“When she realized this, Mu Yourong was ecstatic. Her heart was so excited that it was beating non-stop. ”

She was thinking.

“If Cen Shaoqing took the initiative to talk to her, how should she reject him? ”

Yes!

Mu Yourong wanted to reject him!

“After all, a man like Cen Shaoqing would definitely be surrounded by a bunch of coquettish bitches who wanted to throw themselves at him! ”

And she was different from those coquettish bitches.

She would be the first person to reject CEN Shaoqing!

Only in this way would she be able to deeply attract CEN Shaoqing’s gaze.

Make Cen Shaoqing marry only her!

He would only love her for the rest of his life.

“”Yourong, when did you arrive? Why didn’t you let anyone tell me?”A pleasant male voice sounded in the air. ”

“Mu Yourong turned around and saw that it was Li Qiandong. She said gently, “The people who came to the banquet today all have a higher status than me, so I thought that it was best not to disturb Big Brother Li!” ”

Mu Yourong was too understanding!

Li Qiandong sighed in his heart.

“Unfortunately, Cen Shaoqing could never see it. ”

“At this moment, a fat man carrying a gorgeous brocade box walked over to offer his hospitality. ”

“”Young master Li, these are the four treasures of the study that I bought at the auction house not long ago. It is said that they were left behind by master song. I know that senior Li is a scholar, so I believe that he will definitely be interested in these things. This is just a small token of my appreciation. Young Master Li, please accept it.” ”

Li Qiandong’s gaze fell on the brocade box as his thoughts spun.

“He asked his assistant to accept the items and turned to Mu Yourong. “Yourong, I heard that your calligraphy is not bad. There was a master calligrapher in the past. Why Don’t you give it a try? What is this thing that master song left behind?” ”

He wanted Mu Yourong to perform her calligraphy in public.

It was said that a person’s handwriting was like a person’s.

A person’s handwriting represented her appearance and recuperation.

“It just so happened that Cen Shaoqing was also a fan of calligraphy. Who knows, it might be able to gradually attract Cen Shaoqing to Mu Yourong and change his opinion of Mu Yourong. ”

“Once these words were said, everyone looked at each other and began to discuss in low voices. ”

Everyone wanted to see if Mu Yourong’s handwriting was that good.

Mu Yourong was naturally willing to perform a calligraphy show in front of everyone.

“Although the system had not been upgraded to level 10 yet, it was still not a problem to use it to display calligraphy once. ”

“With the system in hand, she was a master calligrapher. ”

“Then I’ll make a fool of myself!”

Li Qiandong got someone to arrange the four treasures of the study.

“Mu Yourong walked over, picked up a brush, and began to write on the hanging rice paper. ”

Everyone stared at Mu Yourong without blinking.

“Mu Yourong worked hard and wrote two lines on the rice paper: The Sea admits all rivers, and tolerance is great! ”

“The brush was flowing like water, with a silkworm head and a swallow’s tail! ”

It was very beautiful!

“It’s really well written!”

“The MU family is indeed a scholarly family!”

The onlookers praised sincerely.

“Mu yourong said humbly, “It’s not well written. I’m sorry for making a fool of myself!” ”

“Xu Jiao suddenly said, “If sister mu can write so well, then Miss Ye, who grew up in the MU family, must be able to write even better, right?” ”

“That Little B * tch, Ye Zhuo, would make her suffer so much! ”

“Now, of course, she couldn’t let go of this opportunity to embarrass ye Zhuo. ”

“Mu Yourong followed her words and said, “I think sister Ye Zhuo is also very outstanding.” ”

“Xu Jiao said, “Then why don’t we invite Miss Ye to come up and compete with sister Mu to see who is better?” ”

“As soon as she said this, everyone turned their eyes to Ye Zhuo, who was eating dessert. ”

“Ye Zao, who was suddenly hit by Cue, frowned slightly. ”

Who would be in the mood to write in front of such delicious food?

“”If my handwriting isn’t good, then I won’t embarrass myself.” ”

“Hearing this, everyone revealed an expression of understanding. ”

Ye Zao was originally a good-for-nothing.

“He actually said that he couldn’t even recognize it, so how could he know calligraphy? ”

No wonder he didn’t dare to come up and compete with Mu Yourong!

“So, this was true. A fake could never become real! ”

“Even if she became beautiful now, she would not be able to stand out in public. ”

“Mu Yourong tried to explain for ye Zao, “Although Sister Ye Zao grew up in my family, she is not of the Mu family’s bloodline after all. Therefore, it is understandable that her handwriting is not good.” ” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly and put down the dessert in his hand. “Since everyone is in such high spirits and wants to see me embarrass myself, then I won’t spoil everyone’s elegance.” ”
