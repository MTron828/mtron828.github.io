“At this time, she was very regretful, even her intestines were green with regret! ”

She regretted why she broke up with Yesen.

She should have accompanied Yesen down the road. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“If she had accompanied Yesen down the road, she would be the wife of the boss now, how could she have the right to speak to these people! ”

But it was useless to regret now.

...

At the same time.

Beijing.

Lin Ze’s bedroom.

“The door was half-closed. Standing outside, one could vaguely see the inside of the room. ”

Inside.

“Lin Ze sat in front of his desk, holding a piece of chewing gum-like wrapping paper. He placed it on the tip of his nose and sniffed it gently. His expression was one of enjoyment. ”

Beside him was a bag of white powder-like objects.

“Aunt Zhang stood outside the door, looking at the scene inside. The corners of her mouth curled into a proud smile. ”

Lin Ze would never be able to get up this time!

“Once Old Mrs. Lin lost hope in Lin Ze, she would definitely think of a way to make Feng Qianhua pregnant with Lin Jincheng’s child. ”

The reason why Old Mrs. Lin had been hesitating was because Lin Ze was here.

“If she used those underhanded methods, Lin Ze would definitely hold a grudge against her as a grandmother. ”

“But if Lin Ze was already crippled, then old Mrs. Lin wouldn’t have to care about Lin ze anymore. ”

“Auntie Zhang quietly turned around and left, afraid of alerting the people inside. ”

Feng Qianhua came on time to deliver the health soup to Old Mrs. Lin. She had just walked into the Lin family with Feng Xianxian when she saw Auntie Zhang walking down from upstairs.

“Auntie Zhang.”

“”Miss Qianhua, Xianxian, you’re here.” ”

“Feng Qianhua nodded. “Mrs Zhang.”After saying that, she turned to look at Feng Xianxian beside her. “Xianxian, quickly call Grandma Zhang.” ”

Feng Xianxian’s face was filled with displeasure.

Asking her to call a servant Grandma?

On what basis?

“Xianxian!”Feng Qianhua frowned.

“Mrs Zhang smiled and said, “Why are you arguing with the child! Right, old madam is in the backyard admiring the flowers. I’ll call someone for you.” ”

“We’ll go with you.”Feng Qianhua led Feng Qianxian to follow Aunt Zhang’s footsteps.

They walked all the way to the backyard but did not encounter a single servant.

“When they passed by the rockery, Aunt Zhang turned to look at Feng Qianhua and said, “It’s not convenient to talk here. Let’s Talk Over There?” ”

“Feng Qianhua nodded. “Qianxian, wait for us here.” ”

Feng Qianxian nodded.

Feng Qianhua followed in Aunt Zhang’s footsteps.

The two of them arrived at the rockery.

Aunt Zhang whispered a few words into Feng Qianhua’s ear.

“Upon hearing this, Feng Qianhua’s face was filled with shock. “Are you sure you didn’t see wrongly?” ”

“”I saw it for real!”Aunt Zhang continued, “I’ve been observing him for a few days. It’s almost the same time every day, about an hour at a time. If you bring the old lady over, you’ll definitely catch him in his true form!” ”

Feng Qianhua nodded.

The two of them came out of the rockery. Feng Qianhua already had a plan in mind and lowered her head to say a few words to Feng Xianxian.

“Hearing this, Feng Xianxian’s face turned pale. “Mom, Really?” ”

“”It can’t be wrong.”Feng Qianhua continued, “Xianxian, in front of your Grandma Lin later, do you know what to say?” ”

Feng Xianxian nodded.

“That’s good.”A satisfied smile appeared on Feng Qianhua’s lips.

“Feng Qianhua was looking for old Mrs. Lin, and Old Mrs. Lin was looking for Feng Qianhua. ”

Nothing else.

It was because Feng Qianhua came to deliver the health-preserving soup to her at this time every day.

She could not leave this health-preserving soup for a day now.

“As long as she forgot to drink it, she would not be able to lift her spirits and would even cough up blood. ”

“Moreover, Feng Qianhua was filial and considerate. Old Mrs. Lin was also willing to talk to her. ”

“Qianhua.”Old Mrs. Lin had just turned a corner when she saw Feng Qianhua and Aunt Zhang walking over.

“”Grandma Lin!”Feng Xianxian pounced over and pretended to like old Mrs. Lin very much. She hugged old Mrs. Lin, but in fact, she was extremely disgusted. ”

If it wasn’t for the fact that she wanted to become the Lin family’s granddaughter...

She wouldn’t have to be so mean to herself.

Old Lady Lin was overjoyed. “Xianxian is here too! Grandma’s good granddaughter. I haven’t seen you for a few days. I really miss grandma to Death!”

“”Grandma, I Miss You Too! But the college entrance exam is coming up soon, so I’ve been studying at home for the past few days!”Feng Xianxian hugged Old Lady Lin’s arm. ”

“Old Lady Lin smiled and said, “Yes, yes, yes, the college entrance exam is more important. Qianxian is so smart, she will definitely be able to get into a good university!” ”

“”Aunt Lin.”Feng Qianhua walked over with a smile. “Qianxian, stop pestering your grandma Lin. Go away.” ”

“”It’s okay, it’s okay. I treat Qianxian like my own granddaughter.”Old Lady Lin waved her hand. ”

“After that, old lady lin continued, “Qianhua! It’s really hard for you to still think of sending soup to an old woman like me every day! If it weren’t for you, I’m afraid I would have gone to Hell Long Ago!” ”

Feng Qianhua quickly spat a few times. “Aunt Lin! Don’t spout nonsense! You want to live a long life!”

“Feng xianxian echoed, “My mother is right, Grandma Lin. You will definitely live a long life.” ”

Old Mrs. Lin was very happy to be coaxed by the mother and daughter.

The few of them walked to the main hall.

“Feng Qianhua took out the health soup from the insulated box and said unintentionally, “Aunt Lin, isn’t it Sunday today? Why aren’t you seeing Ah Ze?” ”

“Old Lady Lin said, “I don’t know what happened to that child these past few days! He’s so mysterious! He hasn’t been seen all day.” ”

“Hearing that, Feng Xianxian continued, “Grandma Lin, I have a classmate who is good friends with brother Ah Ze. I heard... I heard...” ”

“”Heard what?”Seeing Feng Xianxian like this, Old Lady Lin looked up nervously. ”

“”I, I, I don’t dare to say...”Feng Xianxian bit her lip. ”

“Old Mrs. Lin continued, “Did something happen to Ah Ze?” ”

“I don’t dare to say...”Feng Xianxian was about to cry.

“Feng qianhua frowned and said, “You child, what can’t you tell your Grandma Lin? Tell me quickly! Do you want to worry your Grandma Lin to Death?” ”

“Old Mrs. Lin held Feng Xianxian’s hand and said extremely kindly, “Good child, don’t be afraid. Tell Grandma, what exactly is going on?” ”

“Feng Xianxian said hesitantly, “I, my classmate told me that brother Ah Ze has been acting very strange these few days. There are always white bags of powder and long pieces of paper in his school bag...” ”

Old Lady Lin’s expression changed.

“Aunt Zhang continued, “Hearing Xianxian say this, it reminds me of something. When I passed by the young master’s room just now, I saw a few bags of powder on the table in the young master’s Room!” ”

“”B * Stard! This B * Stard! I think his good days are over!”Old Lady Lin slammed the table and stood up, her face full of anger. ”
