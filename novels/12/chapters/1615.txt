“Chapter 1616: 242: the three-year agreement has arrived, and the aircraft carrier is out! 6”

She’s Tang Xue’s leader?

No!

That’s impossible!

How Old is this little girl?

“She looks like she’s at most seventeen or eighteen years old, how could she possibly be Tang Xue’s leader.”

“Maybe she’s the same as her, using someone else’s work card to impersonate her!”

“Now, she’s here pretending to scare her.”

Right.

It must be like that.

“Bai Yun snorted, “I’ve seen too many people like you who rely on others to intimidate others! I’ll give you three minutes to think about it! If you don’t give me the treadmill, I’ll make sure you don’t see the Sun Tomorrow!””

Ye Zhuo didn’t say anything.

“At this moment, a tall figure trotted over from the other side.”

Bai Yun was attracted by the sound of footsteps.

This person was actually minister Liu of the Security Department.

Why was Minister Liu Here?

Bai Yun swallowed her saliva.

This minister Liu was someone that even Tang Xue had to respect!

“If he came, wouldn’t her fake identity be exposed?”

No!

She couldn’t let minister Liu discover her.

“Bai Yun quickly turned her head and said to ye zhuo, “Why aren’t you coming down? There’s a limit to a person’s patience!””

“At this moment, Liu Zhuo walked directly to Bai Yun’s side and stopped. He said respectfully, “Miss Ye!””

“Ye Zhuo stood on the treadmill and slightly lowered his eyes. He looked at Liu Zhuo and said, “Liu Zhuo, how did you become the head of the security department? You didn’t even notice that there were outsiders in the base sneaking in to eat and drink?””

Bai Yun looked at Ye Zhuo in disbelief.

Could it be...

Could it be that ye Zhuo was really some big shot?

But she clearly looked so young.

“At this moment, Bai Yun’s body was covered in cold sweat.”

“If she was really caught on the spot, where would she put her face? Especially since she had just used her identity as Tang Xue to teach many people a lesson.”

“Thinking of this, Bai Yun’s face burned with pain.”

What should I do?

“Liu Shao looked at ye Zhuo, and his forehead broke out in cold sweat.”

“Although ye Zhuo was young, his aura was not small at all, especially when he became serious.”

“”Miss Ye, please clarify.””

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Take a good look at who this Miss Tang beside you is.””

“Liu Shao turned his head, and only then did he see clearly that the person standing beside him was Bai Yun.”

“Most importantly, Bai Yun was actually wearing Tang Xue’s work badge.”

One had to know that the Cen family base’s dining area and entertainment area were forbidden for outsiders to visit.

“”Bai Yun?”Liu Zhuo turned his head to look at Ye Zhuo. “Miss Ye, this is Tang Gong’s cousin, Bai Yun. She is also one of the examinees today. Her work badge should have been given to her by Tang Gong.”” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

What he meant was that this matter had nothing to do with him.

“After all, Bai Yun had entered through the proper channels.”

“As for these matters, they were all caused by Tang Xue.”

“Ye Zhuo’s tone was light, and his red lips parted slightly, “Tang Xue has derelict her duties and has given her work badge to another person without authorization. This has already seriously violated the base’s employee code of conduct, Articles 5 and 13. “Have her submit a 3,000-word report before tomorrow. In addition, this examinee named Bai Yun’s results for this assessment are all invalid. She will forever be blacklisted by the base.””

“Bai Yun’s legs were weak, and all the strength in her body seemed to have been sucked away in an instant. She was filled with regret.”

How could she have imagined that such a young girl’s position in the base was actually higher than Tang Xue’s!

Liu Zhao gave a look to the two security guards beside him.

The two security guards immediately controlled Bai Yun and brought her outside.

“A second ago, Bai Yun was still awe-inspiring, showing off in front of everyone, but now she had become a drowning dog.”

“”Miss Tang!”Sun Yue, who had just taken something for Bai Yun on the first floor, saw Bai Yun being dragged away by the security guards and stood up in surprise. “What’s wrong with Miss Tang?””

“Someone immediately laughed and said, “This isn’t miss tang! It’s just a fake, just a freeloader!””

“”But I heard that she’s Miss Tang’s cousin, and Miss Tang wanted to help her pull some strings. Who knew that the head examiner wouldn’t fall for Miss Tang’s tricks!””

“”The funniest thing is, do you know how many points this Baiyun Assessment has scored?””

“How many?”

“I heard from the assessment department that it’s 0 points!”

“”0 points? Oh My God! What is Miss Tang thinking, to actually want to pull strings for such a person?””

“Tang Xue is just relying on old master Tang’s small meritorious service and wants to order around in the base. She doesn’t even look at her own weight!”

The air was filled with mocking laughter.

“Tang Xue was standing behind everyone. When she heard these words, she was so angry that her entire body was trembling.”
