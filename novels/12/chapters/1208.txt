Han Dongliang lay on the bed without any reaction.

“If not for the fact that the EKG was still beating, no one would have thought that he was alive. ”

Yi Tao and Chen Qiaoye were in disbelief.

“Half a year ago, Han Dongliang was still a living person who was talking and laughing. ”

How did he become like this now?

“Yi Tao leaned over and said softly, “Cousin, I’m here to see you.” ”

Han dongliang still did not react.

“About five minutes later, the few of them came out of the sterile room. ”

“Yi Tao was already mentally prepared. Han Dongliang’s condition would not be too good, but he did not expect it to be so serious. ”

“”Auntie, what exactly happened to cousin? Did the doctor say what illness it was?” ”

“Mrs. Han wiped her tears and said, “At first, we thought it was just a common cold. Who knew that it would become more and more serious. In the end, it became like this...” ”

“The doctor only said that it was a paralysis caused by a stroke. The exact cause of the illness could not be found.”

“...”

“At the end of her sentence, Mrs. Han almost broke down in tears. ”

“”Auntie, Don’t cry.”Chen Qiaoye patted Mrs. Han’s back. “I believe that my cousin is blessed by the heavens. He will definitely recover.” ”

Mrs. Han hugged Chen Qiaoye and burst into tears.

“Chen Qiaoye understood Mrs. Han’s current mood very well. She then comforted her, “Back then, Yi Tao’s condition was even worse than my cousin’s, but he still recovered in the end...” ”

“At this point, Chen Qiaoye seemed to have suddenly thought of something, she continued, “Right, Auntie, we can ask the godly doctor who cured Yi Tao back then to come and take a look at cousin! Godly doctor ye is so amazing. If she can cure Yi Tao, then she can definitely cure cousin!” ”

“Upon hearing this, Mrs. Han seemed to have grasped onto the last straw. “Qiaoye, you’re right! Where does godly doctor ye live? I’ll get someone to invite her right now!” ”

Yi Tao was also incurable back then. He was even persuaded by the Doctor to give up treatment and pull out his oxygen tube.

He did not want to suffer.

But Yi Tao miraculously recovered in the end.

This was enough to prove Miracle Doctor Ye’s ability!

“When he heard this, Han Lushan also looked at Chen Qiaoye with Hope. ”

“Compared to the Zhao family’s Niu Huang Wan, Han Lushan still hoped that he could cure Han Dongliang through other means! ”

“This way, he could continue to support ye Zao. ”

“Chen Qiaoye continued, “Miracle Doctor Ye used to live in Yun Jing, but she moved to Beijing later on! We haven’t seen each other for a long time, but I have her phone number. I’ll contact her now.” ”

“”Then contact her quickly, contact her quickly.”Mrs. Han urged Chen Qiaoye. ”

Chen Qiaoye immediately picked up her phone and called ye Zao. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“One second, two seconds, three seconds... ”

“Seconds and minutes passed, but no one picked up. ”

Mrs. Han was extremely anxious.

“Although Han Laoshan did not say anything, he could tell from his expression that he was also very anxious. ”

“After making more than a dozen calls, no one picked up on ye Zao’s end, chen Qiaoye continued, “Auntie, it might be that Miracle Doctor Ye is busy with something. I’ve already left a message on her wechat. She’ll definitely reply to me when she sees it.” ”

“Mrs. Han nodded and continued, “Then qiaoye, Tao Tao, don’t leave tonight. Stay at home for a few more days!” ”

“Chen Qiaoye turned to look at Yi Tao, who nodded. “Alright Auntie, as long as you don’t find it troublesome.” ”

“Mrs. Han smiled and said, “How can I find it troublesome?” ”

“After saying that, Mrs. Han sent someone to tidy up the guest room. ”

It was almost the end of the year.

Ye Zhuo was getting busier and busier every day.

“By the time she realized the missed calls on her phone, it was already past seven in the evening. ”

Ye Zhuo called back. “Mrs. Yi.”

“Upon receiving ye Zhuo’s call, Chen Qiaoye was very excited. “Miracle Doctor Ye, you finally picked up the call!” ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Is there something you need me for?” ”

“Chen Qiaoye told her about Han Dongliang’s situation. “Miracle Doctor Ye, my cousin is the only child in my aunt’s family. He has yet to get married and have children. I hope that you can help him.” ”

“Ye Zhuo looked at his schedule and continued, “Where Are you now?” ”

“”Jing fan center,”said Chen Qiaoye. ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “I’m also in Jing fan center. Why don’t we meet at 10:30 Tomorrow Morning at 789 Xichang Road outside the traditional Chinese Medicine Store?” ”

“”Then it’s settled, Miracle Doctor Ye. I Won’t leave until I see you!” ”

“I won’t leave until I see you.”

“After hanging up the phone, ye Zhuo dialed his secretary’s internal line. “Ally.” ”

“”President Ye, I’m here.” ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Cancel all my schedule for tomorrow morning.” ”
