“Chapter 1632: 344: aircraft carrier lifts off, blood boiling! 6”

Translator: 549690339

“As soon as these words were said, all the cameras focused on the figure that was slowly walking towards them.”

The young girl wore a black uniform and wore long boots as she walked towards them step by step.

“Her figure was graceful, exuding a valiant and valiant aura that could topple countries and cities.”

Every step she took was filled with wind!

“Miss Ye!”

“Burn Father!”

“Zha Zha!”

“Ye Zao nodded at Cen Shaoqing and Professor Hua en. Then, he walked up to the stage, dialed the microphone, and slightly bent his body. Although it was an unintentional action, he exuded a powerful aura, “Everyone, I’m sorry that I’m late because of some things! Today is the 18th of May, year 21. Mankind will enter Neptune for the first time, leaving behind the first footprint, the first flag...””

“Looking at the figure on the stage, Tang Xue narrowed her eyes.”

Didn’t Ye Zhuo run away? Why would he suddenly appear here?

Could it be that she could really make the aircraft carrier fly?

No.

Impossible!

On the live broadcast bullet screen:

“[ Ah Ah Ah! Daddy is so handsome! SOB SOB SOB, I even cried. I knew Daddy wouldn’t run away. ]”

“[ Hehe, what time is it? You’re still bragging! ]”

“[ go, burning daddy! ]”

[ is this YC dreaming? Stepping into Neptune? Does she know what’s on Neptune? I’m afraid she’ll turn into space trash before she reaches Neptune! ]

[ YC must have been captured by the International Department! ]

Dr. Cara and the leaders of the other countries didn’t expect ye Zao to suddenly appear.

“”Since Dr. YC is here, please show us your work,”Dr. Cara continued, “But let me be clear. If your aircraft carrier can not reach the speed of light and land on Neptune within four hours, please sign the agreement immediately!”” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Anyone could build a spacecraft.

But it was almost impossible to reach the speed of light.

“Because humans did not have the technology at the moment, Dr. Cara had been emphasizing the problem of the speed of light.”

Ye Zao nodded slightly. “I’ll give you the same thing.”

“Dr. Cara smiled and said, “Don’t worry. China always keeps its word, unlike some countries that don’t keep their promises.””

“”That’s good.”Ye Zao pressed the communication device beside his ear and said, “Tang Mi, you can come over now!””

“Got it!”Tang Mi’s voice came from the other side.

“Dr. Cara looked at ye Zao and said, “Dr. YC, didn’t you say that you want to show us your aircraft carrier? Where’s your aircraft carrier?””

“At this moment, there was an uproar in the venue.”

“At the same time, a shadow covered the top of everyone’s head. It was so dark that it was as if the sky had suddenly turned dark. When everyone looked up, they saw a huge object flying over from the horizon.”

That kind of shock could not be described with words!

“The aircraft was obviously very big, but no one could feel the slightest bit of noise.”

Ye Zao smiled slightly and pointed at the sky. “Isn’t it already here?”

Professor Cara looked up.

His eyes were filled with shock.

It was unbelievable.

“The flying object in front of them could not be seen at all. If they had not seen it with their own eyes, no one would have believed that such a huge object would appear in the Sky?”

What kind of theory did ye Zao use to make the aircraft carrier fly into the sky?

A nuclear reactor and protons?

No!

Impossible!

These two things could not be turned into power materials at all.

What was going on?

“”Dr. Kala.”Gadomi patted Dr. Kala’s hand and said in a low voice, “Just wait and see. Soon, China will make a joke.””

It was not difficult to build an aircraft carrier that could fly.

“Let alone China, any country with slightly advanced technology could build it.”

“However, an aircraft carrier could be called an aircraft carrier not only because it could fly.”

“It had to have a defense system, an attack system, and a hidden system.”

“Otherwise, before the combat aircraft carrier could reach the territory of a certain country, it would be blown down by a missile.”

Therefore.

The aircraft carrier made by Ye Zao was just an ordinary aircraft in the eyes of Gadomi. It was still far from a real aircraft carrier!

Dr. Kara also calmed down.

Gadomi was right.

It was not the end yet.

What did the speed of light represent? The speed of light represented the blink of an eye.

“With the current level of human civilization, how could it reach the speed of light?”

It was simply a pipe dream.

Tang Xue crossed her arms and looked at the aircraft carrier in the sky with a mocking look in her eyes.

She was thinking the same thing as Gadomi.

“The thing that ye Zao had built was not an aircraft carrier at all. At most, it was a flying machine. Therefore, she was not worried at all that this thing could land on Neptune.”

She just had to wait for ye Zao to embarrass himself.

“Ten minutes later, the aircraft carrier could not reach the speed of light. She wanted to see how ye Zao would end up.”

The aircraft carrier did not fly high. Tang mi held onto the railing and waved at ye Zao. “Miss Ye!”

Ye Zao also waved at her.

“A moment later, ye Zao turned to look at the people present, “Let me introduce to everyone. This is China’s first aircraft carrier! “Ten minutes later, I will fly to Neptune on this aircraft carrier. Five hours later, I will meet everyone here again. The entire process will be recorded by the cameras.””

“F * ck! F * ck! F * ck! This aircraft carrier is really huge!”

“”It can’t really reach the speed of light, right?””

“”Oh my God, I’m going to cry!””

“”Pretentious, this size is impossible to reach the speed of light. It’s even landing on Neptune! Dream On!””

“I feel like the scene of the aircraft carrier hovering in the sky is similar to the one I dreamed about.”

[ is the Great China going to Pout? ]

[ waiting to be slapped in the face. ]

“[ it’s just an aircraft that looks like an aircraft carrier. What’s so great about it? If our country C is willing to make such an aircraft, let alone one, we can even make 10 or 100 of them. ]”

[ exactly. Look at the Chinese People’s unworldly faces. Barbarians are barbarians! ]

“Dr. Cara looked at Ye Zhuo, “Dr. YC, I believe that the audience here can’t wait for you to fly the aircraft carrier to Neptune. Don’t keep them waiting. Hurry up and fulfill their wishes. Fly the aircraft carrier and set off for Neptune.””

“As you wish.”Ye Zhuo raised his eyes slightly. “Tang Mi!”

“Yes!”Tang mi immediately called a meeting. She pressed the switch and a flight of stairs immediately appeared from the aircraft carrier and connected to the ground.

“Under the sunlight, the silver stairs emitted a dazzling light.”

“Ye Zao was about to walk up when Dr. Warne, the four brothers, Yu Zifei, and the others caught up with him. “Miss Ye, Wait! We want to go with you!””

“Let’s go.”Ye Zao nodded slightly and the few of them walked up to the aircraft carrier.

The audience could only see their backs.

“At this moment, a low voice came from ye Zao’s communicator. “Zao Zao, I’ll wait for you here.””

“”Okay, remember to prepare the desserts that I like.””

“Okay.”

“Looking at the backs of Ye Zao and the others, Dr. Cara waved to his assistant beside him.”

The assistant immediately went over.

Dr. Cara lowered his voice and whispered a few words into the assistant’s ear.

“The assistant nodded. “Okay, doctor, don’t worry! I’ll arrange for someone to handle it right away.””

Country C was a nation of weapons.

“The aircraft carrier had a huge target. As long as they fired a nuclear weapon at random, the aircraft carrier would self-destruct in the air!”

“When that time came, the scene would definitely be very exciting.”

“Dr. Cara’s assistant, David, walked to Tang Xue’s side. “Miss Tang, our doctor has something for you.””

“Please go ahead.”Tang Xue looked at David.

David lowered his head and whispered a few words into Tang Xue’s ear.

“Hearing this, the corners of Tang Xue’s mouth curled up proudly. She then said, “Okay, please rest assured, Dr. Cara. I will definitely not disappoint his expectations!””
