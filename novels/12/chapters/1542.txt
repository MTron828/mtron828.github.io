“You’re awake.”Dog two nodded.

“Lin Ze continued, “It’s getting late, let’s go back first.””

“”Okay.”dog two continued, “I’ll go get them.””

“Not long after, the four of them walked out of the clubhouse.”

Lin Ze walked in front.

“Fat Tiger looked at Lin Ze. “Brother Ze, what’s wrong with you? You Don’t look right!””

“Li Wen nodded. “That’s right, brother Ze. Is Something on your mind?””

Lin Ze took out a note from his pocket and handed it to Li Wen. “Take a look at this.”

Li Wen took the note and the other two went over to take a look.

“”F * ck! F * ck!”Li Wen exclaimed in surprise. “Brother Ze, what does Zhang Qingqing mean by this?””

“Fat Tiger looked at Lin ze and said, “Brother Ze, did you really lose your virginity and have sex with her?””

Dog two frowned. “I knew something was wrong with Zhang Qingqing. I didn’t expect that she would do such a thing.”

Lin Ze’s face was expressionless. “What happened after I went to my room last night?”

“Li Wen said, “After you went to my room, Zhang Qingqing came to us to play with us. Then, we fell asleep! I don’t know what happened after that!””

“”My memory is like a mosquito.”Buttface was regretting it now. He regretted that he had drunk too much last night. If he hadn’t drunk too much, things wouldn’t have turned out like this.”

“Fat tiger said in distress, “I was drunk before you guys. If you guys don’t know, then I don’t know either.””

Lin Ze didn’t say anything else.

“Li Wen patted Lin Ze’s shoulder, “Brother Ze, don’t be anxious. What if things aren’t what you think! Besides, didn’t Zhang Qingqing say that she won’t Pester You Anymore? Just pretend that none of this ever happened!””

Fat Tiger nodded. “Mozzie is right!”

“Dog Two felt that things weren’t that simple. If Zhang Qingqing would just let it go, she wouldn’t have taken such a big detour to scheme against Lin Ze! However, he couldn’t say it out loud. In the current situation, saying it out loud would only cause trouble for Lin Ze.”

“There were no surveillance cameras in the private room of the clubhouse, so there was no way to investigate this matter!”

“”Brother Ze, let’s go back first.”Buttface looked at Lin Ze. “We’ll talk when we get back.””

Lin Ze nodded slightly.

“After this birthday party, an Lizi didn’t receive any more calls from Zhang Qingqing.”

“Until a month later, an Lizi received a call from Zhang Qingqing.”

“”Hello, Lizi, I’m at the hospital. Can you come over?””

“When she heard that Zhang Qingqing was at the hospital, an lizi immediately said, “Which hospital are you at? I’ll come over right away.”” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Zhang Qingqing told her the name of the hospital.

An Lizi rushed over.

Zhang Qingqing was holding a report form in her hand. Her eyes were a little red and swollen. She looked a little pitiful as she stood in the crowded hospital corridor.

“An Lizi jogged over. “Qingqing, what’s Wrong?””

“”I’m... I’m pregnant,”Zhang Qingqing cried.”

Pregnant?

An Lizi widened her eyes. “Whose... whose is it?”She had never heard of Zhang Qingqing having a boyfriend.

“Zhang Qingqing cried and said, “Lizi, I didn’t want to tell you at first, but I really had no choice. The Doctor said that my constitution is special. If I forcefully abort the child, I won’t have another child in the future!”! Lizi, what should I do now?””

“”Don’t Cry yet!”An Lizi continued, “Tell me, who is the child’s father?””

“It’s Lin Ze.”Zhang Qingqing handed the report to an Lizi.

Lin Ze!

The child’s father was actually Lin Ze!

How did things turn out like this?

“An Lizi looked at Zhang Qingqing. “Qingqing, are you mistaken?””
