“Looking at the two figures outside the door getting closer and closer, Zhou Rui couldn’t help but become even more nervous. ”

Although he couldn’t see their faces.

But he could still feel that the person who had come was definitely the CEN fifth master who could cover the skies with one hand in the capital.

“Zhou Rui swallowed his throat, his heart instantly rising to his throat. ”

“At this moment, Cen Yuyan held Zhou Rui’s hand and said with a smile, “Don’t be nervous, that’s my fifth brother.” ”

“”OH.”Zhou rui continued, “Then who’s the one beside him?” ”

“That’s my fifth brother’s girlfriend.”

Girlfriend?

Zhou Rui was stunned.

Didn’t they say that Cen Wuye was an anti-marriage activist?

What was going on?

“Just as Zhou Rui was stunned, Cen Shaoqing and ye Zhuo had already walked into the house. ”

Zhou Rui raised his head to look.

“The man walking in front was dressed in a retro long gown. The same-colored buttons were meticulously tied to the top. In his left hand, he held a string of bright red Buddhist beads. ”

“His beautiful facial features seemed to have been carefully carved out. A small red mole was outlined at the top of his eyes, making his cold white skin appear even fairer. ”

“The bottom of her eyes was pitch-black, so deep that one could not see the bottom of it. There was an aura that made people unable to catch up with her. ”

“Then, she looked at the girl next to him. ”

She was wearing a very simple white robe and black pants. Her eyebrows and eyes were like paintings. Her every frown and smile could make everything in the world pale in comparison.

She was cool and cold.

“When the two of them stood together, even if they did not do anything, they were just a painting. ”

Zhou Rui was also a person who had seen countless beauties.

But after seeing this person.

Those people could barely be called mediocre.

“For a moment, Zhou Rui was stunned. ”

“Cen Yuyan quickly pulled Zhou Rui forward. “Shaoqing, zhuozhuo, let me introduce you. This is my boyfriend, Zhou Rui. Zhou Rui, this is my fifth brother. This is my fifth brother’s girlfriend, Ye Zhuozhuo.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing lowered his head to look at Zhou Rui, his eyes indifferent. ”

“”Fifth, Fifth Master.”Zhou Rui greeted him. ” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Actually, compared to fifth master, he wanted to call him fifth brother more. But when the words were on the tip of his tongue, he still did not dare to call him fifth brother. ”

Cen Shaoqing’s aura was too strong.

“Standing in front of him, Zhou Rui felt as if there was a jack pressing down on his body. ”

It was hard to breathe.

Old Mrs. Cen quickly stood up. “Yezi is here! Come over quickly. I’ve already asked someone to prepare dessert.”

“”Thank you, Grandma Cen.”Ye Zhuo walked over. ”

“Cen Shaoqing followed and said somewhat helplessly, “Eat less sweet food. Be careful not to get cavities.” ”

“”I’m not a child anymore.”Ye Zhuo took a bite of the dessert. “It’s so delicious! Grandma Cen, this is made by the new dessert master, right?” ”

“Yes.”Old Mrs. Cen nodded. “There’s a dessert maker at home.”

“Knowing that ye Zhuo liked to eat desserts, the cen family had no lack of dessert makers. ”

“Cen yuying smiled and said, “Zhuozhuo, a dessert maker has come to my house recently. When are you coming over with Shaoqing?” ”

“”Sure, Big Sister.” ”

“After ye Zhuo arrived, everyone’s attention was on Ye Zhuo. ”

Cen Yuyan frowned slightly.

Today’s main characters should be her and Zhou Rui.

“It was Zhou Rui’s first day meeting his parents, and his family was treating him like this. Wasn’t that a little too biased. ”

“In the end, this daughter couldn’t compare to her son. ”

“When a daughter brought a boyfriend back, she was like an outsider. ”

“When her son brought a girlfriend back, he was treasured by the entire family. ”

“What era was this, and they still valued boys over girls! ”

It would be a lie to say that she wasn’t angry.

Who would like to be treated differently like this?

Especially since ye Zao had designed a scheme to sow discord between her and song Chenyu.

“If it weren’t for ye Zao’s design, she wouldn’t have misunderstood song Chenyu. There wouldn’t be any misunderstanding between her and song Chenyu, and Song Chenyu wouldn’t have been hurt! ”

“Therefore, all of this was ye Zao’s fault. ”

“In the past, Cen Yuyan thought that ye Zao was just good-looking. ”

She did not expect ye Zao to be so scheming.

She had to admit that ye Zao was really beyond her imagination.

“Cen Yuyan bit her lip and smiled, pretending that nothing had happened. She walked forward and said, “Oh right, Mom, Grandma, Zhou Rui even prepared a gift for you.” ”

“Zhou Rui also reacted at this time and immediately took out the gift. “Grandma, Auntie, this is a little token of my appreciation. Please don’t mind it.” ”

“Zhou xiang smiled and said, “The family doesn’t lack anything. There’s no need to bring gifts.” ”

“Cen Yuyan said, “At least it’s Zhou Rui’s token of appreciation.” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen looked at Zhou Xiang. “Xiang Xiang, come with me.” ”

“Okay.”Zhou Xiang stood up and followed Old Mrs. Cen’s footsteps.
