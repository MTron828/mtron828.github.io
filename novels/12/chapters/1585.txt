“Chapter 1586: 239: beat him up, too late to regret! 1”

Translator: 549690339

Zeng Rou and ye Zao had known each other for more than ten years.

Zeng Rou knew exactly what kind of person ye Zao was.

“When ye Zao was still Mu Zao, he was only in the first grade when he was nine years old. After he was in the first grade, he couldn’t even distinguish the 26 pinyin letters. Later on, he was already in high school and couldn’t even recognize the most basic everyday Chinese characters.”

He was simply a joke in the circle of Yun Jing!

Every respectable family would use ye Zao as a teaching material?

“Later on, Mu Zao became ye Zao. It was unknown what methods ye Zao’s birth mother used to actually get ye Zao to enter the top scorer in Yun Jing City and be admitted to the capital university.”

Only ye Zao?

Ye Zao could enter the Capital University! ?

Zeng Rou did not believe it no matter what.

“Until now, Zeng Rou still felt that there must be a problem.”

“Ye Zao was so beautiful, and her birth mother was definitely not ugly. There were many tricks up her sleeve!”

The Darkness in this world was far more than she had imagined.

“In front of everyone, even if ye Zao wanted to cheat, there was nothing he could do.”

“Zeng rou smiled at ye Zao. “Zao Zao, please help duo duo duo. She is going to study in F country soon. How can she not pass F language?””

“Zeng Qiuwen followed, “Duo duo is right. I am only a beginner. Although I have stayed in F country for a few years, what I have learned is just the tip of the iceberg. “How can I compare to Zao Zao’s real talent? Fifth Master is really lucky to have a girlfriend who is both talented and beautiful.””

The two cousins sang along with each other. They seemed to be praising ye Zao.

“In reality, they were praising him to death.”

“As the saying goes, the higher you stand, the worse you fall.”

“French was not an international language. If ye Zao did not know it, wouldn’t he lose face in front of everyone?”

Ye Zao smiled faintly. “I’m not as good as you say.”

“”You’re too modest, Zao Zao!”Zeng rou smiled and said, “Who in cloud capital doesn’t know that you’re a talented woman?””

“Bai Shu did not understand what Zeng Rou meant and said in surprise, “Really? Zao Zao is a talented woman in cloud capital!””

“”Yes.”Zeng rou nodded. “And it’s the kind that everyone knows. So, French is not difficult for Zao Zao. Zao Zao is much more powerful than we thought!””

“Ye Zao’s expression was indifferent, and there was no change in his expression. He turned to look at Zhao duoduo. “Duoduo, bring the book over for me to read.””

“”Okay, cousin.”Zhao duoduo brought the French book to Ye Zao’s side. “Look, this is the question.””

“”Yes, let me see.”Ye Zao’s tone was shallow.”

“”I’m not in a hurry,”Zhao duoduo said.”

“Ye Zao looked at it for a moment and then said, “Is there anything you don’t understand? I can tell you together!””

“Really?”Zhao duo duo asked in surprise.

Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Of course it’s true.”

Zeng Rou looked over and her eyes were filled with a mocking smile.

Ye Zao obviously didn’t know how to do it.

“Yet, he was still putting on an act.”

It was simply ridiculous.

That Zhao duo duo was also stupid. She couldn’t even tell that ye Zao was acting.

“Zeng Qiuwen looked at Zeng Rou and said in a low voice, “Look at her, she’s really good at acting! She’s so shameless that even I feel embarrassed for her!””

“Zeng rou snorted, “I already said that she was pretending, but you didn’t believe me, Sister.””

“”I believe you now,”Zeng Qiuwen said.”

“At this moment, ye Zao said slowly, “Actually, this question is very common in French. It’s just like our Chinese polysyllabic words...””

Polysyllabic words!

The sarcasm in Zeng Rou’s eyes became more and more obvious.

How could she not have realized that ye Zao was so good at pretending?

“Zeng Qiuwen frowned slightly. She knew French, so she naturally knew that ye Zao was right.”

Could it be that ye Zao really knew French.

“Ye Zao spoke seriously, and so did Zhao duoduo. In the end, a complete sentence in F came out of Ye Zao’s mouth, and Zeng Qiuwen thought she was hearing things.” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Zeng Rou didn’t know French, so she turned to Zeng Qiuwen. “SIS, what did she say?””

“It’s F language.”Zeng Qiuwen was also in disbelief.

“She thought ye Zao was faking it, but who knew that ye Zao could speak f language so well? Even she, who had stayed in F country for several years, couldn’t compare to him.”

“Hearing this, Zeng Rou widened her eyes. “F language?””

“Yes.”Zeng Qiuwen nodded.

“Zeng Rou gulped. “In that case, ye Zao really knows f language?””

Zeng Qiuwen frowned slightly. “Yes.”

Zeng Rou felt very uncomfortable.

She had originally wanted to make a fool of ye Zao in public and not be able to clean up the mess. Who knew that ye Zao actually knew f language!
