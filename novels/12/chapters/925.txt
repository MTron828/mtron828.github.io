“”He will!”Cen Yuyan said firmly, “He was never with me because I’m the Cen family’s fourth Miss!” ”

Old Mrs. Cen covered her heart with her hand. “Oh my God! I Can’t take it anymore!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“”Mom, are you okay?”Zhou Xiang was shocked and quickly supported Old Mrs. Cen. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen pointed at CEN Yuyan and said, “I’m going to die of stupidity from her!” ”

Cen Yuyan was even angrier than old Mrs. Cen!

“”Grandma, are you looking down on Zhou Rui’s family background?”Cen Yuyan continued, “I know that Zhou Rui’s family background is indeed not good, but three generations up, who is better than who? Although Zhou Rui was not born well, he was never a person who resigned himself to his fate. He relied on his own efforts to bring his parents out of the countryside. In my opinion, he is the most amazing person!” ”

“Cen Yuying stood up and said, “Fourth Lass, have you really gotten to know Zhou Rui? Let Me Ask You, how long have you known Zhou Rui?” ”

“”Two months,”Cen Yuyan replied. ”

Cen Yuying frowned slightly. “It’s only been two months and you believe in him that much?”

“”Because he’s worth it,”Cen Yuyan said. ”

“CEN yuying continued, “Have you met his parents? You’re eighteen years older than him. What did his parents say?” ”

“”His parents are also very satisfied with me, especially his mother. She gave me the jade bracelet of their family’s inheritance.”Cen Yuyan rolled up her sleeves and revealed a jade bracelet. ”

“”Just this? This is also called the jade bracelet of inheritance?”Old Granny Cen stood up excitedly, “Just this thing. I can buy three of them at the street stall at the school gate for a hundred Yuan!”! Cen Yuyan! The Cen family’s fourth miss! Are You Blind? Did the Zhou family trick you with such a small broken bracelet? Are You So Worthless?” ”

Old Mrs. Cen only felt her blood pressure rise.

“It was said that girls had to be well-off, or men would simply give something and cheat them. Therefore, the Cen family’s four sisters had been pampered since they were young. ”

Cen Yuyan had seen all kinds of good things before?

But she was still fooled!

The Cen family’s three sisters were also shocked.

“CEN Yueya said, “Four girls, can’t you tell that this is a cheap street vendor?” ”

“”I know that this bracelet is not valuable,”CEN Yuyan continued, “But can it really be exchanged with money? “The important thing is not how much this bracelet is worth, but that this bracelet is the Zhou family’s inheritance! “Zhou Rui’s mother told me that their family’s conditions aren’t good and they can’t afford to buy anything good. Although this bracelet isn’t worth much, it’s passed down from generation to generation.” ”

“Cen Yuya smiled and said, “Then let me ask you, how many generations have they passed down this bracelet?” ”

Cen Yuyan was stunned for a moment. “I don’t know about this. I only know that this bracelet was passed down from Zhou Rui’s grandmother to Zhou Rui’s mother.”

“”Zhou Rui is 21 years old this year. Not counting the age of Zhou Rui’s grandmother, this bracelet is at least 21 years old. Fourth Girl, take a good look. Does this bracelet really have a history of more than 21 years?” ”

“”Why isn’t It There?”CEN Yuyan continued, “Look at the wear and tear on it. It’s clearly passed down from generation to generation.” ”

“”The wear and tear can also be faked,”Cen Yueya said. “Who knows if this wear and tear is fake!” ”

“”It’s definitely not fake.”Cen Yuyan trusted Zhou Rui very much. “Second sister, without real evidence, what right do you have to suspect Zhou Rui? This is an insult to his personality!” ”

“You’re twisting the facts!”

“It’s your slander!”

Cen Yueya was so angry that she had a headache.

“Ye Zao said with a smile, “Actually, it’s very easy to prove whether this jade bracelet is something that’s 21 years old or not.” ”

“”Zao Zao, do you have a way?”Cen Yueya turned to look at ye Zao. ”

“Ye Zao continued, “The production process of a jade bracelet is divided into four main steps: slicing, delineating, molding, and polishing. However, due to the limitations of Technology 21 years ago, jade bracelets are usually half-hand and half-machine-made. “However, the jade bracelet on fourth sister’s hand was obviously mass-produced by a machine. There was no such technology twenty-one years ago. If fourth sister doesn’t believe it, you can find someone to appraise it. Is this jade bracelet a modern technology or a twenty-one-year-old technology?” ”

“Hearing this, Cen Yueya looked at ye Zhuo with admiration. ”

“Cen Yuyan said, “Then what if it’s appraised that this is a twenty-one-year-old technology?” ”

Ye Zhuo said: “That means Zhou Rui is sincere to you.”
