“After eating the oil tea fruit, Zhang Qingqing patted the bucket bag on her back. “Lizi, did you notice anything different about me today?””

An Lizi looked her up and down and shook her head. “I didn’t notice.”

“Look carefully.”Zhang Qingqing patted her bag again.

An Lizi finally reacted and smiled. “You changed to a new bag? It’s So Nice! It’s exactly the same as the one burning gave me!”

“Zhang Qingqing said, “LV’s new model, 108,000 yuan. I saw that you had it, so I went to buy one.””

“Hearing that, an Lizi said in surprise, “108,000 yuan? That’s so expensive!””

“Didn’t you know?”Zhang Qingqing asked back.

An Lizi shook her head.

“She really didn’t know. She just saw that the bag that ye Zhuo carried to the seafood market to buy vegetables was pretty, so she casually said that it was pretty, and Ye Zhuo gave it to her.”

She didn’t expect it to be so expensive.

“”If I had known that this bag was so expensive, I wouldn’t have posted it on my moments.”An Lizi was a little annoyed.”

“She thought that this bag was at most a few hundred yuan, and a thousand Yuan would break the sky.”

She had not expected it to cost six figures.

It was simply terrifying!

No wonder her roommates had been looking at her differently these past few days.

A hundred thousand yuan.

It was enough for their four years of university living expenses.

“After saying this, an Lizi came to her senses. “Qingqing, your family is rich! You bought such an expensive bag!””

Even though the Zhang family’s family conditions were also very good.

But a bag that cost a hundred thousand yuan was still somewhat unaffordable.

“Zhang Qingqing smiled and said, “It’s not that I’m rich, but I can still afford a bag.””

“In the past, she also thought that a bag that cost 100,000 yuan was very expensive.”

But now...

It was just that. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“An Lizi did not ask further and continued, “Right, are we going to watch a movie now?””

“”Yes.”Zhang Qingqing continued, “Did you buy a movie ticket?””

An Lizi took out her phone. “What movie do you want to watch?”

“”I want to watch a suspense movie,”Zhang Qingqing said.”

“Okay.”An Lizi nodded and started voting.

On the other side.

Zheng Wanyin returned to the hospital with the oil tea fruit.

The nurse had just come to the ward for an examination. The door of the ward was half-closed. Zheng Wanyin had just reached her hand out to the door handle when she heard an abnormal sound coming from inside.

Was she hallucinating?

Zheng wanyin frowned slightly and the hand that pushed the door stopped.

“At that moment, the intermittent sound came again.”

“”Don’t, don’t do this!””

“”Baby, What’s there to be afraid of? There’s no one here now. The nurse just left. Don’t worry! No one will disturb us.””

“What if yinyin comes back?”

“She won’t! She’s only gone out for half an hour. Su’s oil tea fruit is so famous. She Won’t come back for less than two to three hours. Let Me Kiss...”

Zheng Wanyin froze on the spot when she heard the ambiguous voice inside.

Her heart was beating a little fast.

The two people in the ward were Xie Wanqiu and Wu Youyu?

Oh My God!

What were they doing?

Zheng Wanyin felt that her worldview had collapsed.

She had never dreamed that Xie wanqiu would do such a thing.

“Xie Wanqiu was 70 years old this year. Although she took good care of herself and her actual age couldn’t be seen, her age was still there!”

“She was already so old, yet she was still fooling around outside.”

Zheng Wanyin swallowed her throat with difficulty.

One really could not judge a book by its cover.

Xie wanqiu gave birth to a good wife and mother. Who knew that she would still have such a face!

“Most importantly, Zhou Zuolong treated Xie wanqiu very well.”

Xie Wanqiu was in charge of the Zhou family.

What was there that Xie Wanqiu was not satisfied with?

“Although Zheng Wanyin was not related to Zhou Zuolong by blood, she grew up in front of Zhou Zuolong and treated him like her own grandfather.”

“She remembered that when she was young, she had a high fever. As her grandmother, Xie wanqiu actually did not know that Zhou Zuolong had stayed by the bed to watch her all night.”

“If it were not for Zhou Zuolong, Zheng Wanyin would not be here now.”

“Therefore, Zheng Wanyin was really good to Zhou Zuolong.”

“Now that Xie Wanqiu was like this, was she worthy of Zhou Zuolong?”

Zheng Wanyin pinched her fingers and was very angry.

She was burning with anger!

Xie wanqiu actually betrayed Zhou Zuolong. How could she do this.

Did she still have a conscience?

What should she do?

Should she tell Zhou Zuolong about this now.

Zhou Zuolong was so good to her. He was even closer to her than his own granddaughter. She couldn’t watch Xie Wanqiu do something that would let Zhou zuolong down.

“Zheng wanyin frowned, turned around and went to the bathroom.”

“The oil tea fruit was placed on the washing table. She washed her face with cold water and calmed down for a long time. Then, she took out her cell phone and began to call Zhou Zuolong.”
