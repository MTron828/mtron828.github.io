Chapter 74: 072: Face slapping! In the burning business empire, Lin Sha recognized the scumbag and aborted the third child

Ye Zhuo was a very calm person.

An unhappy family could very well destroy a child’s future. Under such circumstances, if Lin Sha chose to have a child, it would not only be irresponsible for herself.

It would also be irresponsible for the child.

Therefore, aborting the child was the best choice.

After saying that, ye Zhuo continued, “Sister Shasha, you are only 20 years old now. There are endless possibilities for your future. There is no need to waste your time on a scumbag like Zhang Qiang. Otherwise, you will definitely regret it in the future.”

20 years old.

The same age as flowers.

Ye Zhuo really did not want Lin Shasha to regret it in the future.

Lin Shasha held her stomach, “But, but it is a small life, and things should not be so serious? $80,000? You know what? Forget it? Maybe Zhang Qiang and uncle and aunt just blame me for the 80,000 yuan, that’s why there are so many misunderstandings, in fact, uncle and aunt are very nice... . .”Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Words fall, Lin sha pause, “Burning burning, or you go to persuade my parents, let them do not want that 80,000 yuan.”Her parents listen to ye burning, as long as ye burning open mouth, they will listen.

Ye Zhonghua frowned slightly. “So, Sister Sha Sha, do you still think that the 80,000 yuan is the problem?”

Lin Sha was stunned.

Wasn’t it?

Ye Zhonghua stood up from the sofa. “Sister Sha Sha, wait for me.”

Not long after, ye Zhonghua walked out of the room with the computer.

Ye Zhonghua placed the computer on the table. The sunlight penetrated through the window and coated the porcelain-white face with a faint layer of light.

She bent down slightly and held the computer screen with one hand while typing on the keyboard with the other. She turned her head slightly and asked, “Sister Shasha, does Zhang Qiang’s family live in Room 201, Building 9, Lane 128, Garden Road?”

It was a very simple action, but it was indescribably cool.

Lin Shasha was stunned. “Zao, how did you know?”

“Come and take a look at this.”Her fair fingers tapped on the enter key.

Lin Sha walked over in confusion.

The screen on the computer froze in a living room, where three people stood.

“Isn’t this Zhang Qiang and his uncle and aunt?”Lin Sha asked in surprise. “Are these the surveillance cameras in their living room?”

The Zhang family was a business family, and they kept a lot of cash at home. In order to prevent thieves, they installed several cameras in the living room.

Ye Zhuo nodded.

Lin Sha continued, “Zhuozhuo, where did you get this?”

Ye Zhuo did not explain in detail, only saying, “I found it online.”

With that, she bent down and pressed the play button.

At the beginning of the video, Zhang Qiang went home to tell his parents that Lin Sha was pregnant.

Then, mother Zhang started calling her a little slut, saying that Lin Sha wanted to marry Zhang Qiang because of the Zhang family’s money.

At first, Zhang Qiang even spoke up for Lin Shasha.

But later, it was obvious that he agreed with mother Zhang’s words.

In Their Eyes, Lin Shasha was a gold digger.

Lin Shasha covered her mouth and looked at this scene in disbelief.

How could this be?

So, she was such an unbearable existence in the hearts of Zhang Qiang and his parents?

She was only pregnant with Zhang Qiang’s child for the sake of the Zhang family’s money?

So, everything she did had a purpose in the eyes of Zhang Qiang’s parents.

Ridiculous!

How ridiculous!

After watching a video, Lin Sha was already in tears.

So, everything was just her wishful thinking.

So, it turned out that an honest person was not a good person.

“Zhuluo, I want to abort this child.”Lin Sha looked up at ye Zhuluo with a determined gaze.

“Have you made up your mind?”

Lin Sha nodded.

“Congratulations, Sister Sha Sha.”Ye searing reached out and hugged Lin Sha. “Don’t be sad. It’s not worth it for such a person. Believe me, your future will definitely be bright!”

“Searing, thank you.”Lin Sha sniffed. “By the way, can you send this video to me?”

Ye searing nodded slightly. “Sure.”

Lin Sha wiped away her tears. “Alright searing, I Won’t disturb you anymore. I’ll go back first.”

Ye searing closed the computer. “Sister Sha Sha, I’ll send you.”Ye searing was a little worried about Lin Sha’s current state.

Lin Sha smiled. “I want to walk alone. Searing, don’t worry, I’ll be fine! He’s just a scumbag. He’s not worth doing anything for me.”

“Alright then. Call me if you need anything.”Ye Zhuo patted Lin Sha’s shoulder.
