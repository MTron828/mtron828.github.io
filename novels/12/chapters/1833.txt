“After saying this, without waiting for Wu Han to reply, the head chief continued, “This name was personally given to you by Miss Ye. Back then, Miss Ye was sixteen years old, and you were fourteen years old. When Miss Ye picked you up, you were already unconscious. It was Miss Ye who saved you with the remaining spiritual herbs! Because it was the coldest season in Changyue at that time, Miss Ye gave you the name Ye Han. From then on, Miss ye treated you as if you were her own brother. You were like brother and sister. Team Leader Ye, could it be that you don’t remember all of this? Team Leader Ye, think about it carefully. You will definitely remember!” ”

“I’ve said it before. My surname is Wu. My name is Wu Han.”Wu Han tightly knitted his brows. “I’m not familiar with Miss Ye at all!”

“The head chief looked at Wu Han and narrowed his eyes. “Team leader Ye, you can’t be heartless. If it wasn’t for Miss Ye back then, there wouldn’t be the current you!” ”

“After saying that, the head chief continued, “Team Leader Ye, have you forgotten what you said before? You said that everything you have belongs to Miss Ye, including your life!” ”

“”Shangguan Jue, what exactly are you trying to say?”Wu Han squatted down and looked at the head chief. “Do you really think that I would betray Miss Qiu just by saying a few words?” ”

No.

He would never betray Qiu Di.

“Even if Qiu Di wanted his life, he would give it to her unconditionally. ”

“”Team leader Ye, Wake Up! Are you letting miss ye down by doing this?”The chief looked at Wu Han with a pained expression in his eyes. ”

He felt that ye Zao was not worth it.

“Ye Zao had done so much for Wu Han, but in the end? ” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“In the end, he ended up like this. ”

“That Strange headache came again. Wu Han pinched his temples, his expression somewhat pained. He endured the pain and just looked at the head chief, he said very seriously, “I only know that if it weren’t for Miss Qiu, I wouldn’t be the person I am now!” ”

It was Qiu di who had saved him on his last breath.

The first person he saw when he opened his eyes was Qiu Di.

“Not only that, there was also a vague memory in his mind. ”

“That was the scene where Qiu di saved him during the cold winter. However, the great chief was now in a state of confusion, saying that the person who saved him during the cold winter was ye Zhuo. ”

How could it be ye Zhuo!

Could it be that his memory could be wrong?

It couldn’t be.

The great chief’s words were to confuse him and make him betray Qiu Di.

“”Team leader Ye, Wake Up! Everything I said is true!”The chief said. ”

“”You should wake up.”Wu Han looked at the chief, then he said, “Shangguan Jue, only Miss Qiu is the real master of the eight big families. Get Someone to bring the files of the inter-star case. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being rude to you!” ”

Wu Han narrowed his eyes at the end of his sentence.

“”Ye Han, Miss Ye once risked her life to save you. Don’t you feel anything at all?” ”

“Wu Han’s head hurt even more. There seemed to be a strong qi current jumping around in his body. Wu Han pressed his temples and continued, “Apart from you, who else can verify the truth of what you said?” ”

“If he was really saved by Ye Zao, and his skills were taught by Ye Zao, then there shouldn’t be no movement at all. ”

“This...”the head chief was stunned.

Because he didn’t know who else knew.

“It was because ye Zao was a low-profile person and didn’t like to show off. Usually, he was like a dragon that disappeared without a trace, so very few people had seen Wu Han. It was also like this, which led to Wu Han being by autumn flute’s side for so long, but no one noticed anything unusual. ”

“”Other than me, there are people from the other seven great clans who can testify,”the great patriarch continued, “Leader Ye, you have to believe me!” ”

“Cut the crap. Go get the information on the star-crossing case.”Wu Han took out the emei thorn that he had put away and placed it on the Great Patriarch’s neck.

“In desperation, the great patriarch had no choice but to get people to get the information on the star-crossing case. ”

“However, this matter was not over yet. He would definitely ask someone to investigate it. ”

Why did ye Han suddenly become like this.

Were Wu Han and ye Han the same person?

On the other side.

“When autumn town learned of the actions of the eight families, he was very worried. He immediately flew to autumn flute’s side. ”

“When he learned that autumn flute had arranged for Wu Han to go to the eight families, autumn town was very worried. “Flute, what if ye Han remembers something?” ”

“”Father.”Qiu di blew on his carefully trimmed fingernails and smiled. “His surname is Wu, and his name is Wu Han.” ”

As for Ye Han.

There was no such person in the universe.

“Seeing Qiu di like this, Qiu Changzhen heaved a sigh of relief. “Looks like my son has a plan already?” ”
