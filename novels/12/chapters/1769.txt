Translator: 549690339

How does this person look like the high and Mighty Cen Fifth Master?

Cen Shaoqing came to the base and waited for Ye Zhuo in front of the car door.

“Unlike the others, he stood there and did not immediately lower his head to play with his phone. Instead, he looked into the distance with a Buddhist bead in his hand. ”

“Soon, Ye Zhuo walked out from inside. ”

“When he saw ye Zhuo, Cen Shaoqing immediately went up to him and handed his coat to her. ”

“It was already winter in the capital, so it was a little cold. ”

“Let’s go.”Ye Zhuo put on his coat and looked at Cen Shaoqing.

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

The two of them turned around and got into the car.

“The car was very fast. In less than half an hour, they arrived at the Lin family manor. ”

Ye Zhuo opened the door and got out of the car.

“CEN Shaoqing said, “Wait a moment.” ”

“What else do you want?”Ye Zhuo looked back slightly.

“CEN Shaoqing said, “There’s still something I haven’t taken.” ”

Ye Zhuo opened the trunk and only then did he see that there was a pile of gifts in the trunk.

“When did you buy this?”Ye Zhuo was a little surprised.

“I had my assistant prepare it in advance.”

“Ye Zhuo said, “If I had known, I wouldn’t have told you in advance. In a while, my mother will blame you for spending money recklessly.” ”

“It’s a token of my appreciation.”Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted slightly.

“As the Lin family’s son-in-law-to-be, Cen Shaoqing would not come to their house empty-handed every time. ”

“Furthermore, the gifts were generous. ”

“According to Old Lady Lin, Cen Shaoqing was already so old. It was not easy for him to find a wife. He must not ruin this marriage. Hence, Cen Shaoqing would bring a generous gift every time he came over, he was also very respectful to his relatives in the Lin family. ” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Today was a big family gathering, so almost all the relatives of the Lin family were present. ”

“Seeing ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing come in, an Lizi immediately ran over. “Great Burning!” ”

“Lizi!”Ye Zhuo turned to look at an Lizi.

“Fifth Master.”An Lizi greeted Cen Shaoqing again.

“Although she only needed to call Cen Shaoqing brother-in-law, Cen Shaoqing’s aura was too strong. After calling him brother-in-law a few times, she could not say it anymore. ”

The pressure was immense.

It was still easier to call him fifth master.

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“”Oh right, where’s fourth aunt?”Ye Zao looked at an Lizi. ”

“An Lizi said, “My mother is talking to youngest aunt inside.” ”

“OH.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Little twelve is back!”

“Aunt!”

“The three of them walked inside. A group of children ran out from inside and hugged ye Zao, unwilling to let go. ”

“Uncle has the latest version of the transformation robots. Do you want to play with them?”Cen Shaoqing leaned over slightly.

“If he had known that the five little guys would definitely be there, he would have pestered ye Zao. Therefore, Cen Shaoqing specially asked his assistant to prepare five custom-made robots. ”

Such high-end robots could not be bought on the market.

“Hearing this, the five little guys were extremely excited, jumping and shouting. ”

“”Yes, yes, yes!” ”

“”Great Job, uncle!” ”

Cen Shaoqing took the five little guys to play with the transformation robots.

“Looking at Cen Shaoqing’s back, Wu Mei said with a smile, “Shaoqing will definitely dote on his children in the future. Every time he comes, he will bring new toys for the little guys.” ”

“Yang Wenyin nodded and echoed, “Exactly. Every Time Our Duan Duan comes home, he will talk about his uncle for a long time.” ”

“Zhang Zhenzhen turned to look at ye Zao. “Zao Zao, when are you and Shaoqing planning to hold the wedding? Take advantage of your youth and quickly have a child. It’s not easy to recover when you’re old.” ”

“”I haven’t thought about it yet,”ye Zao said. “Let’s talk about it after I graduate.” ”

“Yang Wenyin smiled and teased, “Then you guys have to be careful during normal times. Don’t let the gun go off.” ”

Go Off?

Ye Zao was stunned. He didn’t understand what Yang Wenyin meant.

“Wu Mei looked at Yang Wenyin and said, “What nonsense are you talking about? Zao Zao is still a child. He doesn’t know what to say.” ”

Ye Zao’s old face turned red. He realized that Yang Wenyin had already brought him to the car.

“Yang Wenyin smiled and said, “I was just joking! Besides, they’re young and passionate. It’s normal for something to happen. It’s not the old society anymore. If something really happens, just get married!” ”

“At this moment, Xia Xiaoman and ye Shu came out from inside. ”

“Xia Xiaoman was already close to her due date and her belly looked very big. Perhaps it was because she was pregnant, but she looked more than a circle fatter. Her body emitted a strong maternal glow. ”

Ye Zhuo walked over. “Auntie.”

“”Zhuo Zhuo is back.”Xia Xiaoman continued, “Where’s Shaoqing?” ”

Ye Zhuo said: “In the end with them to play.”
