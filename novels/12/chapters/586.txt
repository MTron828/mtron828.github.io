“Judging from ye Zao’s speed, this was her maximum limit. ”

There was a continuous hairpin turn ahead.

She had to overtake ye Zao when she passed the hairpin turn.

Song Chenyu narrowed her eyes and continued to accelerate.

The two cars were chasing each other.

“Ye Zao held the steering wheel with one hand and put one arm on the window. Looking at the Red Car in the rearview mirror, she whistled wickedly. ”

It looked a little cool.

“Compared to Song Chenyu’s nervous expression, she was extremely calm. ”

“Is Miss Ye really racing?”

“Holding the steering wheel with one hand? F * ck! Big Brother!”

Cen Yuyan looked at the big screen and her palms were covered in a layer of sweat.

There was an idiom called ‘accumulate and accumulate.’.

Song Chenyu would definitely not lose to ye Zao.

Definitely Not!

“At this moment, the Red Car suddenly overtook the black car. ”

Cen Yuyan’s eyes lit up. She knew that song Chenyu would not lose to ye Zao!

“What’s wrong with Miss Ye? Why was she suddenly overtaken by Chenyu?”

“Looks like the final winner is still miss song!”

“Cen Yuyan smiled and said, “Chenyu is after all a strong person.” ”

How could ye Zao Compare?

“Looking at the black car that she overtook in the rearview mirror, song Chenyu also heaved a sigh of relief. ”

It seemed that her guess was right.

The current speed was already ye Zhuo’s limit.

She was about to pass the continuous hairpin bend.

Next.

Let her show ye Zhuo what real skill was!

Chenyu song narrowed her eyes.

She had a coach who had won first place in three consecutive car races. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The coach told her.

“Currently, there were only five people in the country who could pass the continuous hairpin bend in two minutes. ”

One of them was her.

“Therefore, it was impossible for ye Zhuo to pass her in the consecutive hairpin bends. ”

“When passing the consecutive hairpin bends, one needed to slow down appropriately. ”

“Otherwise, a car accident might happen because the speed was too fast. ”

Song Chenyu slowed down for a moment and started to pass the consecutive hairpin bends.

“I heard that miss song only needs one minute and ten seconds to pass the consecutive hairpin bends!”

“Is that true?”

“Of course it’s true. Did you watch last year’s interview?”

“That Miss Song is too amazing! It looks like the winner is undoubtedly Miss Song!”

“”Do you even need to say that? Other than Miss Song, who else can pass the hairpin turn in 1 minute and 10 seconds?” ”

But in the next second.

The black car that was originally behind suddenly caught up with the black car.

“In front of them was a series of hairpin turns, but not only did ye Zao not slow down, he even increased his speed. ”

His speed was so fast that one could only see an afterimage.

It was so fast that it made one shudder.

Chi —

It was like a gust of wind!

Song Chenyu widened his eyes in disbelief.

Ye Zao actually increased his speed.

This was a series of hairpin turns!

Her desire to win was too strong.

“There were many car accidents that resulted in death on the race track, and song Chenyu could almost see ye Zao’s end. ”

The spectators were also shocked.

“DAMN! She actually accelerated!”

“Does she know how to race or not? !”

“It’s over! It’s over! The car is going to flip over!”

“Everyone, including Cen Yuyan, was so scared that they closed their eyes. They could not bear to watch this bloody scene. ”

He ziteng also became nervous. His heart was in his throat as he turned to look at Cen Shaoqing.

He saw that Cen Shaoqing’s expression was still calm.

There was no trace of nervousness in his eyes. He held the Buddha bead in his hand and the corners of his mouth even curled up into a faint smile.

“Fifth brother! Aren’t you nervous about fifth sister-in-law?”

“”Don’t worry, she can’t lose.” ”

Cen Shaoqing had experienced ye Zao’s racing skills before. He knew that ye Zao was just testing his skills. There was no need to worry at all.

“Cen Yuyan looked over at Cen Shaoqing and narrowed her eyes. Seeing Cen Shaoqing like this, he did not care much about ye Zao. ”

It looked like.

Cen Shaoqing was just trying to brush off Old Lady Cen and let her enjoy her old age in peace.

“Otherwise, CEN Shaoqing would not be so indifferent. ”

“At this moment, a wave of exclamations suddenly came from the crowd. ”

“Oh my God! She passed!”

“Miss ye actually passed!”

“Holy shit! He actually passed during the consecutive hairpin turns! What kind of godly driving skill is this?”

“Just a second ago, everyone thought that ye Zao would have a tragic car accident. However, in the blink of an eye, not only did ye Zao not have a car accident, he actually left song Chenyu behind with a beautiful grace! ”

The entire process did not exceed 30 seconds.

“Compared to ye Zao’s 30 seconds, Song Chenyu’s 1 minute and 10 seconds were obviously not enough. ”

“Everyone looked at the black car on the race track, which was constantly performing all kinds of thrilling actions. They were so excited that their blood was boiling! ”
