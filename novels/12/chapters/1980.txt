Want to chase them away?

No Way!

There weren’t even windows!

“”It’s up to you.”Xu Chaonan continued, “Anyway, I’ve already sold this villa. If you don’t go out now, someone will come and invite you out later! I’m just here to inform you.” ”

“Are you joking with me?”Father Xu looked at Xu Chaonan and said.

“Xu Chaonan said very seriously, “If you think I’m joking with you, then I’m joking with you. I’ve already done my best for You!” ”

Father Xu’s face immediately turned white.

He knew that Xu Chaonan was serious this time. She was forcing them into a dead end.

“”Xu Chaonan, are you even human!”Mother Xu roared angrily. ”

“Father Xu looked at Xu Chaonan’s back, his eyes filled with viciousness. He narrowed his eyes, picked up the vase on the table, and jumped up! ”

“Since Xu Chaonan did not acknowledge his family, then don’t blame him for being rude! ”

“At worst, they would perish together. ”

“Xu Chaonan had worked in the business for so many years, so he was naturally not a simple person. A bodyguard immediately rushed out from behind and kicked the vase in father Xu’s hand away. ”

Bang!

Pieces of the vase fell to the ground.

“Xu Chaonan turned to look at Father Xu, who was kicked to the ground. His eyes were cold. “Xu Zhanao, I don’t want to argue with you about the past anymore. I didn’t expect you to want to take my life!” ”

“”What do you mean?”Father Xu looked up at Xu Chaonan, his eyes full of sarcasm, “What did I do? Xu Chaonan, I treat you as my closest sister. You alone make the decisions in the Xu family, and I even want to pass on my only daughter to you! But what about you! You actually turned your back on me now! Xu Chaonan, you have no conscience! You deserve to die! You will go to Hell!” ”

Wasn’t it natural for a sister to raise a brother?

But Xu Chaonan actually wanted to abandon them!

Was Xu Chaonan even human? !

“Xu Chaonan sneered, “Do you really think that I don’t know the real reason why every time I have a boyfriend, I fail? “Xu Zhanao, the reason why I didn’t say anything was not because I didn’t know, but because I saw that you are my older brother!” ”

“Xu Chaonan was already forty-two years old, but she was still single. ”

“On one hand, Xu Chaonan did not care about marriage, and on the other hand, it was his brother and sister-in-law’s credit. ”

“After all, she was the Xu family’s money tree. If she married, how would Xu Zhanao and his wife live? ”

“So, as long as she fell in love, Xu Zhanao and his wife would think of ways to destroy it. ”

“As time passed, Xu Chaonan lost interest in falling in love. ”

“Hearing this, Father Xu was stunned. ”

He did not expect Xu Chaonan to know everything.

She just did not say it.

“So, they were the clowns. ”

Xu Zhanao’s face turned green and then white.

“Xu Chaonan continued, “I realized that I was too indulgent with you, that’s why you were so unscrupulous!” ”

Unbridled oppression.

Unbridled bullying.

She indulged her brother and sister-in-law.

But in the end?

What did she get in exchange?

It was simply ridiculous!

“The next second, father Xu burst into tears, he hugged Xu Chaonan’s thigh and said, “Chaonan, I was wrong! I really know my mistake. It’s all brother’s fault. It’s all brother’s selfishness! Brother won’t do it again in the future. Please forgive brother, okay!” ”

He knew that he could not be stubborn this time.

He had to please Xu Chaonan.

“They were blood-related siblings. Xu Chaonan would definitely forgive him. Otherwise, Xu Chaonan would not have indulged them for so many years. ”

“Mother Xu also quickly said, “And me! Chaonan, sister-in-law has also apologized to you. We have let you down in the past. Chaonan, please forgive me and your brother! No matter what, we are still a family!” ”

“”There’s no chance.”Xu Chaonan pulled out his leg. “From now on, we will walk on our own paths. Take care of yourself.” ”

“After saying that, Xu Chaonan left immediately. ”

“Superman!”Father Xu shouted at Xu Chaonan’s back. “Sister!”

“This time, Xu Chaonan left resolutely without even turning his head. ”

“In the following period of time, Xu Chaonan put down the work at hand and started a global tour with his visa and passport. ”

Xu’s parents were in trouble.

“They used to live a life of convenience, but now they were forced to move into a dark and damp basement. ”Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates
