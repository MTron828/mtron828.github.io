“Lizi! Come Here!”

“I’m Coming!”An Lizi immediately trotted over.

Dog two looked at an Lizi’s back and scratched its head helplessly.

The weather really didn’t make things better!

“Just as the confession was about to succeed, Cheng Yaojin suddenly appeared out of nowhere. ”

“How’s brother Dog? Did you catch him?”Fat Tiger walked over from the side and put his hand on dog two’s shoulder.

“Buttface said, “He’s just one step away from success.” ”

“”And then?”Fat tiger asked curiously, “What happened?” ” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Then he was called away.”Buttface looked at Fat Tiger. “That’s right. He’s the bridesmaid you like.”

“Chen Chen?”Fat Tiger asked.

Buttface glanced at him. “Not bad. You even know his name so quickly.”

“”That’s a must,”fat tiger said proudly. ”

“Buttface continued, “Is wechat coming?” ”

“”Not yet, but it’s coming soon,”fat tiger continued, “I just learned that Chen Chen and I have a lot of common interests.” ”

“Although Chen Chen was an author, she was not an otaku at all. She was also an outdoor sports fan. ”

“Then I’ll congratulate you in advance for bringing back a beauty!”Buttface said.

Fat Tiger laughed out loud. “You’re too kind. I also wish that you can get together with your sister as soon as possible!”

“Scram!”Buttface slapped fat tiger directly. “Don’t think that I don’t know that you secretly took advantage of Me First!”

“What are you two talking about? Why Are You So Happy?”Li Wen walked over from not far away.

“Fat tiger continued, “Brother Dog has decided to confess his love to his sister. I’m congratulating him in advance!” ”

“Li Wen said, “Then I’ll also congratulate you on getting the beauty as soon as possible! Oh right, what do you think this is?”As he said that, Li Wen waved his phone. ”

“What?”Fat Tiger asked in confusion.

“Li Wen said somewhat proudly, “Jin Ling’s wechat.” ”

Jin ling was the name of the other bridesmaid.

“”F * ck! F * ck! Mosquito, when did you ask for it? Why didn’t I know about it at all?”Fat Tiger was about to die of jealousy. ”

“He was still thinking about how to get Chen Chen’s wechat, but Li Wen directly added Jin Ling’s wechat. This was too fast! ”

To say that he was not envious at all was a lie!

Li Wen raised his chin. “That’s why you can only live alone.”

“F * ck off! You’re the one who lives alone! Isn’t it just a crappy wechat? What’s so great about it!”Fat Tiger raised his leg and kicked Li Wen’s butt.

“Fortunately, Li Wen dodged quickly. Otherwise, this kick would have directly kicked Li Wen’s body. ”

“Li Wen laughed so much that he could not even straighten his back. “Looking at this guy, I was so embarrassed that I flew into a rage!” ”

“An Lizi hurriedly walked over with the other two bridesmaids. When she saw this scene, she smiled and said, “Fat Tiger, Mosquito, please hurry up and get together!” ”

“An Lizi had been indulging in a rotten drama recently and couldn’t get out of it. Seeing Li Wen and fat tiger like this, she had already imagined a beautiful scene. ”

“Li Wen hurriedly said, “I’m straight! I’m even straighter than steel!” ”

“Fat Tiger said, “I’m straight too! Sister, Don’t spout nonsense! You’re ruining my reputation!” ”

“Seeing that the two of them were so serious, an lizi smiled and said, “I was just joking. Oh right, the wedding ceremony in the front hall is about to begin. The four best men are going to open the door.” ”

“Is the auspicious time set at 12:08?”Buttface asked from the side.

An Lizi nodded.

Buttface looked at the other two. “Then let’s go over first. Don’t delay the proper business.”

Li Wen nodded as well and followed Buttface’s footsteps.

Fat Tiger realized that there was one less person and turned to look at an Lizi. “Where’s master five?”

“They had agreed that there would be four groomsmen, but Cen Shaoqing was like a master. Wherever he went, his left hand would be in his pocket. He looked as if he was a stranger. However, none of the three of them dared to say anything, they even took the initiative to ask if master five needed anything? ”

“An Lizi said, “He’s already in the front hall. You guys can go first.” ”

“Okay.”Fat Tiger nodded and followed them.

Buttface deliberately slowed down his pace and walked with an Lizi.

“An Lizi felt a little uncomfortable when buttface suddenly acted like this. She asked vigilantly, “What do you want?” ”

“”Nothing.”Buttface lowered his voice and continued, “I just want to tell you that I was serious about what I said to you just now. I really want to be with you. It’s not the casual kind.” ”
