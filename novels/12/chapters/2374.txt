Translator: 549690339

Bai Yuanyuan had met ye Shu twice.

Their Hearts were born from each other.

“It could be seen that ye Shu was a soft-hearted person. As long as Bai Mo acted pitiful beside Ye Shu, Ye Shu would definitely help Bai Mo.. ”

Bai Mo was a proud daughter of the heavens. She had been pampered since young. How could she live such a miserable life on Earth.

“Hearing that, Bai Mo continued, “Are you serious?” ”

“”Of course I’m serious!”Bai Yuanyuan continued, “Think about it. Ye Shu is Lin Ze’s mother. In the future, she will be your mother-in-law. “Of course you have to build a good relationship with her, especially before Bai Jingshu has any feelings for her. Since ancient times, the relationship between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law is the most difficult to handle. Just Treat Ye Shu as your mother!” ”

“Hearing this, Bai Mo’s face was filled with disgust. ”

Treat Ye Shu as her mother?

What Was Ye Shu?

She was just an earthling. What right did she have to be her mother?

“Bai Yuanyuan smiled and said, “Momo, no matter what, Ye Shu is Lin Ze’s biological mother. If you want to marry Lin ze successfully, you have to settle with Ye Shu first. “Not only do you have to treat ye Shu as your mother, you also have to make ye Shu treat you as her biological daughter.” ”

Bai Mo nodded. “Alright.”

“Bai Yuanyuan continued, “Mo Mo, I wish you every success.” ”

“Thank you.”

“After cutting off the connection, Bai Mo went outside. ”

“Liu Chao immediately walked over. “Miss Bai, I’m going to go out for a sports car now. You Can Rest at home now. Here’s some money. If you want to go out, you can use this money to take a taxi.” ”

“With that, Liu Chao handed the money in his hand to Bai Mo.. ”

Bai Mo took the money. “Send me to the Lin family.”

She had already decided that she would go to the Lin family to look for ye Shu and build a good relationship with her.

“The Lin Family?”Liu Chao was stunned.

Bai Mo nodded.

“Liu Chao continued, “Is it the Lin family from the capital?” ” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“In the capital, there were only a few families that could be called the Lin family. ”

“Yes.”

“Hearing this, Liu Chao said with some difficulty, “The Lin family manor is in the city center. The license plate is restricted at this time. Moreover, you have to make an appointment before going to the Lin family. If not, outsiders can not enter.” ”

Outsiders?

She was an outsider?

“Bai Mo’s eyes flashed with ridicule as she continued, “I’m not an outsider. You can just send me there.” ”

“Liu Chao knew that she did not understand the meaning of the license plate restriction. “Miss Bai, My Car Can’t enter the city right now. How about this, I’ll call a car for you.” ”

“Okay.”Bai Mo nodded.

Liu Chao was originally a black car driver and knew many of his peers. It was very easy to call a car.

“Very soon, the car arrived. ”

It was still a van.

“When she saw the van, Bai Mo recalled the experience from yesterday. She had not even gotten into the car when she started to feel dizzy! ”

“Is there no other car?”Bai Mo asked.

“The city is restricted. It’s already good enough to find a car.”The driver walked out of the driver’s seat and looked Bai Mo up and down before turning to Liu Chao. “Is this your relative?”

Relative?

How could she be a relative of someone like Liu Chao?

Bai Mo’s face was filled with disgust.

“Liu Chao did not say anything. He walked to the driver and said in a low voice, “She’s a distant relative. Her mind is not very clear. If she says something wrong later, don’t hold it against her.” ”

“Hearing that, the driver turned to look at Bai Mo and nodded. “Okay.” ”

“Liu Chao looked up at Bai mo. “Miss Bai, Please.” ”

Bai Mo resisted the urge to vomit and got on the car.

“The moment she got on the car, her expression changed. The driver knew that Bai Mo might be carsick, so he picked up the car-sickness spray from the front seat and handed it to Bai Mo., “Miss, Carsick, right? Spray a little of this and you won’t faint!”Ever since Miracle Doctor Ye created this miraculous car-sickness spray.., there were no longer any carsick people in China! ”

“Car Sickness Spray was simply the good news for all Carsick people, and it was also China’s black technology! ”

Bai Mo disdained using things that belonged to Earthlings and turned a blind eye to the sunscreen spray that the driver handed over.

“Because in her opinion, an Earthling did not have the right to speak to her at all. ”

“Liu Chao immediately smiled apologetically and said, “Thank you, Brother Qiang!” ”

“Wu Qiang took back the car sickness spray and said, “It’s nothing.”Why did he have to be so calculative with a person who had a problem with his brain? ”

“She was a pretty young lady, but she did not expect that her brain was not good. ”

Bai Mo started to get Carsick again.

“Liu Chao handed the car sickness spray to Bai mo again and said, “Miss Bai, please give it a try. The effect is really good!” ”

Bai Mo did not say anything.

She could not be bothered to say anything more to a person like Liu Chao.

“White Jasmine did not answer, Liu Chao had to put the car-sick spray back in place. ”
