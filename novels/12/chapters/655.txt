“Old Mrs. Lin continued, “Xianxian grew up in front of me. That child is smart and kind. All these years, it’s all thanks to her taking care of me! Besides, think about it, it’s your sister. As an older sister, shouldn’t you give in to her? Xianxian likes Shaoqing very much. Grandma hopes that you can give Shaoqing to her! “You’re so sensible. You definitely won’t reject Grandma, right?” ”

The only way to make up for Feng Xianxian was to let ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing break up.

“Feng Xianxian liked Cen Shaoqing so much. After hearing this news, she would definitely be very happy. ”

“If it wasn’t for Feng Xianxian, Old Lady Lin would also compromise in front of Ye Zhuo and play the family card. ”

“Old Lady Cen didn’t relent. Other than playing the family card with Ye Zao, Old Lady Lin had no other choice. ”

Ye Zao was only a nineteen-year-old child.

The older the wiser!

“Ye Zao looked at Old Lady Lin like this, his expression still the same, “First, I don’t have a sister. Second, I won’t break up with Cen Shaoqing. Don’t waste your expression acting in front of me. Do you know that acting is really too ugly?” ”

Old Lady Lin’s breathing stopped.

She was almost angered to death.

“She poured her heart and soul out in front of Ye Zao, but ye Zao said that she was acting. ”

Who Wouldn’t be angry?

“Old Lady Lin originally thought that as long as she played the family card with Ye Zao, Ye Zao would definitely listen to everything she said. ”

“After all, Ye Zao had always wanted her recognition. ”

But she didn’t expect that ye Zao was actually impervious!

“Although she was very angry, Old Lady Lin still tried her best to smile, “Child, what nonsense are you talking about! Grandma is not putting on an act with you! Grandma sincerely hopes that you can give Shaoqing to xianxian... ... Isn’t it only right for sister to give way to sister ? This is a fine tradition of our country!” ”

Sister should give way to sister?

Old Lady Lin really had the guts to say that.

“Ye Zhuo looked up at Old Lady Lin. “Since you don’t understand human language, I won’t waste my breath on you.” ”

“After saying that, she turned around and left. ”

“Old Lady Lin was so angry that she slammed the table and stood up. She pointed at ye Zhuo’s back and said, “Ye Zhuo! You’re really good!” ”

Ye Zhuo looked back slightly and the corners of his mouth carried a slight smile. “Thank you for the compliment. I also think that I’m good.”

Old Lady Lin pointed at ye Zao and held her breath in her chest. She almost suffocated.

Too Much!

This wild girl was too much!

Whose granddaughter was like her?

She couldn’t even compare to Feng Xianxian’s finger!

She didn’t even look at herself to see if she was worthy of Cen Shaoqing!

At this moment.

Lin Qingxuan walked in from outside.

She was all smiles. It looked like something good must have happened.

“Seeing Old Lady Lin clutching her chest and panting, Lin Qingxuan asked curiously, “Mom, what happened to you?” ”

“Old Lady Lin said with a cold face, “I was still angered by your good niece!” ”

“If ye Zao had agreed to break up with Cen Shaoqing, would she have been so angry? ”

“”What did Zao Zao Do to You?”Lin Qingxuan continued to ask, “Did you say something unpleasant in front of Zao Zao?” ”

“Old Lady Lin was already angry, and now she was infuriated by Lin Qingxuan. ”

“Lin Qingxuan! I’m your mother!”

“Lin Qingxuan continued, “It’s precisely because you’re my mother that I have to remind you that it’s time for you to retire. Don’t always think about meddling in the affairs of the younger generation.” ”

“Old Lady Lin now had a son, a grandson, and a granddaughter. She even had five great-grandsons. ”

“It was supposed to be a time for fun, but Old Lady Lin had been living a good life and had to go through a lot. ”

She didn’t know what she was going through?

“Hearing this, Old Lady Lin’s heart was filled with anger again. ”

The sons of other families all knew that they were on the same side as their mother.

But Lin Qingxuan was fine.

“It was fine if she didn’t help her, but she even felt that she was meddling in other people’s business. ”

“After a while, old Mrs. Lin continued, “You’ve been leaving early and returning late. Are you dating su ran?”Old Mrs. Lin only hoped that Lin Qingxuan would marry Jiang Su ran as soon as possible, jiang Su ran was a filial and good child. She definitely wouldn’t be as heartless as Lin Qingxuan! ”

“Old Mrs. Lin had observed that Lin Qingxuan not only left early and returned late, but she also carried a faint scent of perfume when she went home. ”

Perfume was something only women used.

“Lin Qingxuan turned to look at Old Madam Lin. “Mom, I told you before that Jiang Su ran and I are not suitable for each other. Don’t mention this in front of me in the future.” ”

He had been on a date recently.

But the other party was not Jiang Su ran. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“”Su ran is sensible and filial. How is it not suitable if she’s Beautiful?”Old Madam Lin pointed at Lin Qingxuan’s nose and said, “All of you, are you trying to make me so angry that I’m willing to die?” ”

“Lin Qingxuan looked at Old Lady Lin, “Mom, I know you are doing this for my own good, but Jiang Su ran and I are really not compatible. We are not the same type of people. Don’t worry, I promise to bring back a daughter-in-law for you in the shortest amount of time.” ”

Old Lady Lin narrowed her eyes and the anger in her heart disappeared a little. “You have someone outside?”

“”Not yet,”Lin Qingxuan continued, “But I’m working on it.” ”

“Hearing this, Old Mrs. Lin hurriedly asked, “Where are they from? What are their family conditions like?” ”

“Mom! You’re here again!”Lin Qingxuan frowned. “Is family background so important to you?”

“Old Mrs. Lin said, “Do you know what it means to be of equal status? Love that is not of equal status will not have a result!” ”

“Lin Qingxuan’s expression instantly turned cold. “If it wasn’t for the fact that you said that we were of equal status, I wouldn’t have married Zhao shuning back then!”Although Lin Qingxuan had always said that she didn’t blame Old Lady Lin.., in the end, it was all because of Old Lady Lin. ”

Old Lady Lin was stunned.

She knew that Lin Qingxuan was still blaming her.

“She had only done one wrong thing in her life, but Lin Qingxuan was unwilling to forgive her... ”

“Lin Qingxuan looked up at Old Mrs. Lin. “Mom, you rest first. I’m going back to my room.” ”

“Looking at Lin Qingxuan’s back, old Mrs. Lin’s eyes reddened again. “This child still won’t forgive me!” ”

“Aunt Zhang walked to Old Mrs. Lin’s side and comforted her. “Old Mrs. Lin, don’t be sad. I believe that Qingxuan will understand your painstaking efforts one day.” ”

Old Madam Lin sighed deeply.

On the other side.

Ye Zhuo had just walked to the bedroom door when his phone rang.

He picked up the phone and took a look.

It was a call from Gu Dening.

“”Hello, Sister Dening.” ”

“Gu Dening’s voice came from the other end of the line, “Miss Ye, are you at home now?” ”

“I’m at home.”

“GU dening continued, “It’s good that you’re at home. The test results are out. I’m going to send them over to you.” ”

“They’re out?”Ye Zao was a little surprised.

“The medical facilities were not up to date yet, so ye Zao thought it would take a long time. ”

He did not expect the results to be out so soon.

“Ye Zao continued, “Sister Dening, I’ll have to trouble you to make the trip.” ”

“It’s no trouble. It’s my pleasure.”

“After hanging up the phone, gu dening drove over. ”

Ye Zhuo came to the door to pick her up.

“Gu dening was wearing a small suit, looking clean and neat. “Miss Ye, I have something to do, so I won’t go in. Here is the test report, please take a look.” ”
