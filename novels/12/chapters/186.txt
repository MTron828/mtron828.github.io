Chapter 187: 087: so it’s Ye Zhuo! Old Mrs. Cen was trying to trick Cen Shaoqing! 7

Zhou Zeyan shook his head. “I haven’t met a suitable one.”

Old Mrs. Cen continued, “I have a very good little girl here. Do you want me to...”

Before Old Mrs. Cen could finish her sentence, CEN Shaoqing stood up and picked up a piece of fish with his chopsticks and placed it into old Mrs. Cen’s bowl. “Grandma, this is your favorite west lake vinegar fish. Please try it and see if it tastes good.”

Old Mrs. Cen raised her eyelids and looked at Cen Shaoqing.

Little Fellow!

He was going to fight with her!

Old Mrs. Cen gave her face and took a bite. “It’s alright.”

After saying that, old Mrs. Cen picked up a chicken leg with her chopsticks and gave it to Ye Zao. “Zao Zao, the taste of this tiger skin chicken claw is very good. Try it. Oh right, there’s also your favorite crayfish in a while.”

Zhou Zeyan smiled and continued, “So ye zi likes to eat crayfish too! I like it very much too!”

Ye Zao nodded. “I’m a carnivore. As long as it’s meat, I basically like to eat it.”Actually, in his previous life, Ye Zao did not have much appetite. After the age of nineteen, when he was hungry and thirsty, he would drink some nutrient solution. Under normal circumstances.., he did not even need to eat once every two or three days.

In this life, he had completely let himself go.

Life was so long. If he did not eat and drink more delicious food, he would be letting himself down.

Granny CEN said, “Yezi especially likes spicy food. Zeyan, can you eat spicy food?”

......

“Of course!”Zhou Zeyan nodded. “Crayfish is of course the best spicy food!”

“Yes, Zeyan, you’re absolutely right! It’s a pity that some people are going to miss out on this earthly delicacy.”As soon as she said that, Granny Cen’s gaze inadvertently swept past Cen Shaoqing.

One sentence had two meanings. Those who understood it would naturally understand it.

Cen Shaoqing lowered his head to eat the vegetables, his beautiful straight eyebrows slightly furrowed.

Not long after, a servant came up with a steamed coconut crab.

Looking at the red coconut crab, old Mrs. Cen raised her head to look at Zhou Ze Yan. “Ze Yan, you boys...”

Before she could finish her sentence, CEN Shaoqing stood up and brought the coconut crab to her. “Grandma, you girls need to take good care of your hands. I’ll Peel the crab for you.” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Hearing this, Old Mrs. Cen nodded in satisfaction. “Yes, yes, yes! Boys have tough skin and thick flesh. You should be the one to do this kind of work!”

Cen Shaoqing slowly separated the coconut crab and placed it on the plate.

Old Mrs. Cen picked up some crab meat and placed it into ye Zhuo’s bowl. “Yezi, this coconut crab tastes like coconut. It tastes even better when dipped in the crab roe. Try it quickly.”

Ye Zao did not stand on ceremony with old Mrs. Cen. He picked up a piece of crab meat and dipped it in the crab roe. It was fresh, fragrant, and delicious. Even without vinegar, it was still exceptionally delicious.

Before they finished the crab meat, Zhou Xiang picked up some spicy chicken for ye Zao. “Zao Zao, you like spicy food. This spicy chicken will definitely suit your appetite.”

“Not only does yezi like spicy food, she also likes sweet ones. Also, this osmanthus candy lotus root is not bad.”

Old Madam Cen and Zhou Xiang were like competing to serve food to Ye Zao. Not long after, Ye Zao’s bowl was filled with dishes.

It was also because ye Zao had a good appetite.

If it was anyone else, they would definitely not be able to finish it.

Old Madam Cen liked to watch ye Zao eat.

It was not pretentious at all.

Unlike some socialite daughters, in order to maintain their figure, they would count the rice every time they ate. They would not eat anything high in calories or high in protein... ... although they had lost weight, they looked like they were malnourished.

Therefore, every time old madam Cen saw ye Zao eat, she would have a strong appetite.

Her granddaughter-in-law was the best.

She ate everything!

It was easy to feed her.

At three o’clock in the afternoon, Ye Zao said goodbye.

“AH? You’re leaving so soon?”Zhou Xiang held ye Zao’s hand, her face full of reluctance.

Even Big Fatty, who was in ye Zao’s arms, meowed in dissatisfaction.

Ye Zao smiled and said, “Aunt Xiang, remember to visit my house with Grandma Cen next time. It’s getting late, I should go back.”

After saying that, ye Zao continued, “Oh, right, Aunt Xiang, remember to bring big fatty with you.”

“Meow,”big fatty responded, as if in response to ye Zao’s words.

Ye Zao hugged Big Fatty and sucked on his body. “You’re the cutest.”

Yes!

Satisfied!

CEN Shaoqing’s gaze swept past big fatty, his gaze cold.

Caught off guard by CEN Shaoqing’s gaze, big fatty quickly crawled into Ye Zao’s embrace!

F * ck!

Was this the gaze that wanted to kill Meow?

At this moment, Zhou Zeyan also said goodbye.

Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “Then Zeyan, you can bring Yezi back with you.”

Zhou Zeyan nodded. “Sure. It’s my honor to be able to send Yezi home.”

He was worried that he wouldn’t have the chance to be alone with ye Zao!

Cen Shaoqing took out the car keys from his pocket. “Zeyan isn’t on the way. I have something to do at the company. Ye Zao, you should come with me.”

“Since Zeyan is not on the way, then let Yezi take your car.”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Yezi, this brat has a weird personality. If he bothers you on the road, you must not despise him.”

“How can that be!”Ye Zao smiled slightly. “Then I’ll have to trouble Mr. Cen.”

“It’s on the way.”Cen Shaoqing’s tone was slightly indifferent.

Zhou Zeyan, who was beside him:”...”if it wasn’t on the way, he could take a detour!

He was very willing to take a detour!

Really!

The old lady looked at the backs of ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing as they left, and her eyes were filled with smiles.

Rascal!

Fighting with her!

He simply didn’t know the immensity of Heaven and earth!

This wasn’t the first time ye Zhuo had taken Cen Shaoqing’s car.

Unlike the two times in Beijing, this time, Cen Shaoqing had personally driven the car.

She sat in the passenger seat.

Cen Shaoqing held the steering wheel with one hand and the prayer beads with the other. “If you’re bored, you can connect to the Bluetooth in the car and play music.”

“Okay.”Ye Zao lowered his head and fastened his seat belt.

Ye Zao originally didn’t want to play music.

However, with just her and Cen Shaoqing in the car, the atmosphere was quite awkward. In order to divert her attention, she connected to the Bluetooth and turned on the music player.

Soon, the faint sound of music flowed through the car.

...

At the same time, at the song family home.

The man was wearing a well-tailored handmade suit. He sat in front of the French window and stood tall.

His face seemed to be covered with a layer of dark clouds.

No one could have predicted that in the next second, he would be happy or angry.

Knock, Knock, Knock

At this moment, there was a knock on the door.

“Come in.”

The assistant in a suit pushed the door open and came in. He stood behind song Shiyu and said respectfully, “Boss, we have a lead on that matter.”

“Speak.”Song Shiyu subconsciously turned the ring on his index finger.

“The kidnapping case twelve years ago involved a total of three families.”

“Which three families?”

“The third daughter of the Zhao family in the east of the city, the eldest daughter of the Mei family in the west of the city, and the MU family.”At this point, the assistant paused, “I’ve already sent people to check. There are no scars on the arms of the third daughter of the Zhao family and the first daughter of the Mei family.”

Song Shiyu was not surprised to receive this. “What about the Mu Family?”

The assistant hesitated for a moment before continuing, “The situation of the Mu family’s Miss Ye is special. We haven’t checked it out yet...”

The man who was originally as gentle as jade suddenly turned into a wild beast. “Trash!”
