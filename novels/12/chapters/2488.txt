“Between Men, it was nothing more than bragging and women. ”

“No matter how abstinent and apathetic a man was, he had to solve his normal physiological needs. ”

“Bai Jiayu didn’t have a fixed girlfriend, but he never lacked female companions. He had his own to raise and also had business partners to gift him. ”

He never mistreated himself.

“”You go by yourself,”song Shiyu said with a dull expression. ”

“Bai Jiayu was used to wandering among the flowers. Seeing song Shiyu like this, he couldn’t help but say, “Third brother, you can’t do this! Can your body handle it?” ”

Song Shiyu didn’t say anything.

“Bai Jiayu continued, “Third brother, come and take a look with me! Maybe you’ll Meet Your True Love?” ”

“I’m not interested.”

His true love wouldn’t appear in such a place.

“”Third brother,”Bai Jiayu sat across from song Shiyu again. “Can you tell me a little about the kind of girl that makes you so chaste?” ”

“He did not know about the past, but in the ten years that Bai Jiayu had known song Shiyu, Song Shiyu had never been involved with any girl. ”

“No one.”Song Shiyu directly denied it.

“”Third brother, that’s not good enough!”Previously, Song Shiyu would admit that there was someone he loved but couldn’t get, but now, song Shiyu directly denied it! “Tell me about it! I’ll see if that girl is worth it!” ”

Song Shiyu picked up a feudal document and began to read it.

It was obvious that he didn’t want to talk to Bai Jiayu.

“Bai Jiayu didn’t know why song Shiyu would suddenly change so much. He continued, “Third brother, are you really not going?” ”

“No.”

Song Shiyu picked up his phone. “I heard that there’s a celebrity who looks very much like that celebrity. He’s very pure. Are you really not going to consider it?”

“”You...”song Shiyu raised his head to look at Bai Jiayu and said slowly, “Do you want to participate in the African Project?” ”

“Hearing this, Bai Jiayu immediately waved his hand and refused. “I was wrong! I was wrong for the three of you! I’m leaving! I’m leaving Right Now!” ”

“After saying that, Bai Jiayu ran away without looking back, as if he would be caught by song Shiyu in the next second. ”

“Song Shiyu looked at Bai Jiayu’s back as he left. He massaged his temples, and there was a hint of fatigue between his brows. ”

On the other side of the South China Sea.

Ye Zao had spent a lot of time on vacation during this half month.

“He didn’t have to worry about anything. The first thing he did when he opened his eyes every day was to play. When he was bored, he would go for a walk by the seaside with Cen Shaoqing to enjoy the sea breeze. ”

“Leader.”

Cen Shaoqing walked out of the back room.

“What’s Wrong?”Ye Zao looked back slightly.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “I have something to do today. I might not be back until tomorrow. If you have something to do, go look for Yu Niannian.” ”

“Alright.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Then I’ll be leaving first.”Cen Shaoqing walked over and left a faint kiss on ye Zhuo’s forehead. “Take care of yourself.”

“Okay.”

Ye Zhuo sent Cen Shaoqing to the door.

“Yu Mumu was watering the lawn outside. When he saw Cen Shaoqing leave, he raised his voice and said, “Zixu is going out!” ”

“”Okay.”CEN Shaoqing continued, “Take care of your sister-in-law!” ”

“Got it!”

“At this moment, Yu Luonian no longer had any animosity towards ye Zhuo. ”

Yu Luonian had also changed his view of women.

“Now that he thought about it, the corner of Yu Luonian’s mouth would reveal a helpless smile. In the past, he was too shallow. He thought that there were no good girls in this world and there was no true love. People were just using each other, a relationship where they needed each other. ”

Only now did he know.

“At that time, he was so stupid that he was cute. ”

He could never see reality by measuring others with himself.

Ye Zhuo turned around and walked into the house.

“Yu Luonian looked at her back and said loudly, “Sister-in-law, if you need anything, don’t be polite with me.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo turned his eyes slightly.

“She had just woken up and her hair had not been tied yet. It was all draped over the back of her head. She was wearing a plain white dress. When she turned to the side, the sea breeze blew up the wide hem of her dress. It was entwined with her black hair, revealing a delicate face, it was spring and snow. ”

It was as if the white snow had lit up the red plum blossom.

It was soul-stirring.

“Yu Mumu immediately averted his gaze. “Sister-in-law, what do you want to eat for lunch?” ”

“”I’ll eat whatever you have. I’m Not Picky,”ye Zao said. ”

“Okay.”Yu Mumu nodded.

“Ye Zao returned to the room, took out his phone, and started playing games. ”

“As soon as he went online, he saw that an Lizi, Zhao pingting, and Li Yueyue were all online. ”

The four of them immediately formed a team and began to fight.

“”One less person,”an Lizi said. “Searing, go and pull someone over.” ”VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience
