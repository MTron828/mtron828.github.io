Translator: 549690339

Didn’t Xu Yao say that she made these pastries herself?

Mother he wanted to see how Xu Yao would make these pastries.

“When she said this, Xu Yao was stunned. ”

It seemed that she wasn’t hallucinating.

Mother he really didn’t like her.

“Otherwise, she wouldn’t have made things so difficult for her. ”

Xu Yao narrowed her eyes without a trace. She really couldn’t figure out how she had offended mother he.

It seemed that mother he didn’t like her from the start.

Why was that?

Could it be that mother-in-law and daughter-in-law were really natural enemies?

No.

She had to think of a way to make mother he treat her as her biological daughter.

“Hearing this, father he immediately said, “Xunfang, what are you talking about! There’s no reason for the guests to do anything! If you want to eat sugar-free higher food, just let the pastry chef do it.” ”

“After saying that, father he looked at Xu Yao and said somewhat embarrassedly, “Miss Xu, I’m sorry. Your aunt is joking with you. She loves to joke!” ”

“At the end of his sentence, father he and father he laughed a few times to resolve the awkwardness. ”

“Mother he smiled and said, “I’m not joking with Miss Xu. I just don’t know if I have the honor to eat the pastry that Miss Xu personally made?” ”

“”Look at what you’re saying, Auntie. It should be my honor to personally make pastries for you.”Xu Yao looked into he ziteng’s eyes and continued, “Ziteng, where’s your family’s pastry shop?” ”

“Of course, he ziteng wouldn’t really let Xu Yao go to the pastry shop. ”

“Xu Yao was here as a guest today, not to make pastries. “Yaoyao, my mother is just joking with you! Just Sit Down.” ”

Mother is really too much!

It was also because of Xu Yao’s good character that she had endured until now.

“Mother he looked at Xu Yao, her beautiful eyes slightly narrowed. Xu Yao was more scheming than she had imagined. ”

“These pastries were obviously not made by her, but she was so calm. ”

“Her face was not red, and her heart was not beating. ”

“If it was not for her good eyesight, she might have really been deceived by Xu Yao. ”

“”Ziteng, do you think your mother is the kind of person who likes to joke around?”Mother he looked at he ziteng and continued, “Miss Xu, since Ziteng isn’t willing to bring you, I’ll bring you. You come with me.” ”

A dark light flashed in Xu Yao’s eyes.

“Ouyang Xunfang, this old B * Tch! ”

How had she offended her? !

“Mother!”He ziteng stood up as well.

“Mother he smiled and said, “If you want to come, you can come too. You can learn how to make pastries from Miss Xu. You’ve grown so big, you probably don’t even know how to make flour, right?” ”

He Ziteng didn’t say anything and pulled Xu Yao’s arm.

“Xu Yao looked up at He ziteng and said in a low voice, “I’m fine.” ”

“Seeing Xu Yao like this, he ziteng sighed and said, “I’ll go with you.” ”

“Okay.”

“Soon, they arrived at the pastry shop. ”

“When the pastry chef saw that the family of three had arrived, he said in confusion, “Sir, Madam, Young Master.” ”

“Mother he nodded and said, “Master Zhu, you go and rest first. Leave the pastry shop to Miss Xu.” ”

Master Zhu nodded.

“Standing in front of the pastry shop, Xu Yao frowned. She was already regretting in her heart. Why did she say that she made the pastry herself. ”

She did not expect that mother Xu would let her make pastries on the spot!

What should she do now?

She did not know how to make pastries at all.

Wouldn’t she be exposed later?

“She had always had a good girl image in front of He ziteng. If he ziteng knew that she actually lied, he ziteng’s impression of her would definitely worsen. ”

“No, no. ”

She could not let such a thing happen.

Xu Yao clenched her fists.

“Mother he saw the change in Xu Yao’s expression, and the corners of mother he’s lips curled up. ”

Just you wait.

Xu Yao’s Fox tail was about to be exposed.

She wanted to see how Xu Yao would end up.

“Mother he continued, “Miss Xu, all the tools in the pastry shop are very complete. If you need anything, just let us know.” ”

“After saying that, mother he looked at he ziteng again. “Ziteng, take a good look at how Miss Xu’s pastry is made!” ”

“”Got it,”he ziteng said reluctantly. ”

“Father he tugged at mother he’s sleeve without a trace and said in a low voice, “Xunfang! Enough is enough!” ”

“Today was the first time miss he came to the house, so why make things difficult for her? ”

“Mother he lowered her eyes slightly and said in a voice that only the two of them could hear, “Go and check this need. See if she is Xu Chao’s niece.” ”

“Father he was a little speechless and said, “Is it because this girl’s surname is Xu that you want to make things difficult for her?” ”

“Mother he could not be bothered to explain anything to father he. “If I tell you to go and check, then go and check!” ”

“OH.”Father he was like a little daughter-in-law who had been bullied. He lowered his head and walked out.

“Mother he looked at Xu Yao and said, “Miss Xu, you can start now.” ”

“Okay.”Xu Yao nodded. She put on the pastry chef’s clothes and the white dust-proof hat. She stood in front of the pastry counter and pretended to do the preparations.

“Xu Yao looked very shocked, but she was actually very panicked. ”

What should she do?

What method should she use to resolve this?

“If this continued, she would really be exposed! ”

“At this moment, Xu Yao’s eyes lit up as if she had thought of something. ”

“He ziteng stood at the side and watched Xu Yao busy herself. He felt very reluctant and continued, “Yaoyao, do you need my help?” ”

“Xu Yao smiled and looked up. She continued, “No need, I can do it myself. Don’t get your clothes dirty.” ”

“He ziteng nodded. “If you need my help, just let me know.” ”

“”Okay,”Xu Yao said. ”

“Xu Yao finished patching up the flour and was about to get the mold. When she passed by mother he, she slipped and fell to the ground. ”

Bang! Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Even mother he was shocked.

Who would have thought that Xu Yao would suddenly do this.

“However, thinking about it carefully, it was actually within his expectations. After all, Xu Yao didn’t know how to make pastries. If she didn’t create some accidents, how could she avoid this? ”

“However, Xu Yao was even more terrifying than mother he had imagined. ”

She was too cruel to herself!

An ordinary person wouldn’t be able to do it.

“Seeing Xu Yao fall to the ground, he ziteng’s heart ached terribly. He immediately ran over to help Xu Yao up. “Yaoyao, are you alright?” ”

“Mother he continued, “From the looks of it, I shouldn’t be able to make pastries anymore. Miss Xu, I wonder if I’m right?” ”

The meaning behind her words was very obvious.

Xu Yao bit her lip and didn’t say anything. Her face was full of grievance.

I can’t help but feel sorry for her.

“”Mother, what do you mean?”He ziteng was speechless. “Do you mean that Yaoyao fell on purpose?”He ziteng really didn’t understand why his mother would go against Xu Yao! ”

“They were both women, why would a woman make things difficult for a woman! ”

“Hearing that, Xu Yao immediately said, “It’s okay, I’m fine. Don’t worry, Auntie, I can still continue to make pastries.” ”

“”What can you do!”He ziteng said angrily, “Your Hand is bleeding!” ”

“After saying that, he ziteng grabbed Xu Yao’s hand and said, “Mom, take a look for yourself!” ”

“Xu Yao’s hand was pressed against the metal plate on the side. Because the penetration force was too strong, it caused a deep cut on her hand. ”

“After a while, her entire hand was dyed red with blood. ”

He ziteng’s heart ached terribly. He wished that he could directly replace Xu Yao and suffer this pain!

“Although her hand was injured, Xu Yao did not cry out in pain. Instead, she said with a smile, “Ziteng, I’m really fine. You Don’t have to be so nervous. You just need to bandage it up.” ”

“He ziteng frowned. “It’s already like this, and you still say it’s fine!” ”

Then what was considered fine?

Mother he looked at this scene coldly. The sarcasm in her eyes could be clearly seen.

Xu Yao’s acting was really too clumsy.

“From the beginning, she knew that Xu Yao would definitely do something. ”

“After all, she did not know how to make pastries at all. ”

“”Ziteng, take Miss Xu to bandage her wounds first,”mother he said. ”

A person would only grow after experiencing it.

“Perhaps this was the path that he ziteng had to take, as long as she could see Xu Yao’s true face clearly. ”

“He ziteng glanced at his mother, then pulled Xu Yao out. “Yaoyao, let’s go.” ”

“Xu Yao was pulled away by He ziteng. Before she left, she didn’t forget to tell mother he, “Auntie, I’ll be leaving first.” ”

“Not long after the two of them left, father he ran over breathlessly. “Xunfang, Xunfang.” ”

Mother he turned to look at father he. “How is it? What did you find out?”

“Father he continued, “You guessed right. Xu Yao is Xu Chaonan’s niece.” ”

Mother he nodded. “No wonder. No wonder my first impression of her was not good.”

“”Then what should we do now?”Father he said worriedly, “From the looks of it, Ziteng seems to love her very much.” ”

“”Just Xu Yao? Is she worthy of our Ziteng’s Love?”Mother he continued to ask, “Do you know why I brought Xu Yao to the pastry shop to let her make pastries?” ”

Father he shook his head. He was more honest and did not have as much foresight as mother he.

“Mother he continued, “I just want to let Ziteng see how hypocritical his girlfriend is. Those pastries were clearly not made by her, and she even said that she made them herself!” ”
