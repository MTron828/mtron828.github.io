Lin Jincheng did not fight back. He was just beaten up by Ye Sen.

“Soon, the left side of his face was swollen and blood flowed out of the corner of his mouth. ”

“”Uncle, stop beating me up.”Lin Ze hugged ye Sen’s hand. ”

“Ye Sen pushed Lin Ze’s hand away. “Little Bastard, get lost! Who’s your uncle? I’m not your uncle!” ”

“If he had known that Lin Ze was Lin Qingcheng’s son, he would not have bothered with Lin Ze at that time. ”

“Saying this, Ye Sen picked up Lin Jincheng’s collar, his eyes were red as he said, “Lin Qingcheng, you bastard! When you were with my sister, you were still fooling around outside! Whose son is this little bastard? What are you trying to do? Let me tell you! If you dare to appear in front of my sister and anger her, I’ll F * * King beat you to death!” ”

What a bully!

Lin Jincheng was simply too much of a bully!

“He already had a child with someone else, and now he still had the face to come in front of him. ”

Was he here to show off?

To show off that he had a son?

Ye Sen even suspected now that Lin Jincheng had left ye Shu back then because he remembered that ye Shu had given birth to a girl.

Scum!

A scum who valued sons over daughters!

“Thinking of this, Ye Sen, who couldn’t take it anymore, gave Lin Jincheng a vicious punch. ”

Lin Jincheng weakly wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth. “Ah Ze is Ah Shu’s biological child. He and his sister are twins.”

What?

Twins?

“Ye Sen was stunned. He thought he was hearing things, so he turned to look at Lin Ze. ”

Ye Sen Saw Ye Shu’s shadow on Lin Ze’s face.

Especially her Phoenix eyes.

The mother and son (daughter) all had the same pair of Phoenix eyes. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

This gene didn’t even need DNA testing to tell that he was ye Shu’s child.

“No wonder when he first met Lin Ze, he felt that Lin Ze was very familiar. He couldn’t help but want to get close to him. Then, he remembered the sad scene when Lin Ze went to look for his mother from afar. Ye Sen’s eyes turned red, he said in a hoarse voice, “Ah Ze...” ”

This child was too difficult.

He met a terrible father and met an unreasonable grandmother.

“”Uncle!”Lin Ze walked over and hugged ye sen. “Uncle, my father had his difficulties back then. You’re angry now. Can you sit down and listen to our explanation?” ”

“Ye Sen sighed and turned to look at Lin Jincheng, “For Ah Ze’s sake, I can take you to my sister. You can explain it to her yourself. Whether she can forgive you or not, it’s not up to me. It’s up to my sister. If my sister doesn’t forgive you, you’re not allowed to harass my sister in the future!” ”

Ye Sen had known Lin Ze for a long time.

He knew that Lin Ze was a very good and filial child.

He couldn’t stop them from recognizing each other.

And Lin Qingcheng was the father of two children after all.

Ye Zao also had the right to know the existence of his biological father.

“”Sen, thank you.” ”

“Ye Sen’s face was cold. “Don’t thank me yet. If my sister doesn’t forgive you, I’ll still beat you up!” ”

Lin Jincheng accepted everything unconditionally.

Ye Shu happened to be resting at home today.

“When Ye Sen arrived with Lin Jincheng and Lin Ze, she was in the kitchen with ye Zao researching new dishes. ”

A seductive fragrance wafted in the living room.

“Sis.”

He was about to meet his mother.

Lin Ze was very excited.

It felt like a dream.

“Although the ye family rented a house, the decorations were very warm. For some reason, Lin Ze found that he liked this place very much. ”

“You’re back.”Ye Shu’s voice came from the kitchen. “There’s watermelon in the fridge. Go get it yourself.”

“Hearing Ye Shu’s voice again, Lin Jincheng’s eyes turned red again. His heart was filled with emotions, and his palms were covered in a layer of sweat. ”

“Ye Sen walked into the kitchen. “Sister, zhuozhuo, come out for a while. There’s a guest at home.” ”

“Who is it?”Ye Shu was a little curious.

“After all, their family didn’t know many acquaintances in Beijing. ”

Ye Zhuozhuo raised his eyebrows slightly and was also a little curious.

“Ye Sen continued, “You’ll know when you come out.” ”

“Who is it? It’s So Mysterious.”Ye Shu untied her apron as she walked out.

She had just walked into the living room when she saw the man standing there. She was stunned.

Was she hallucinating?

“Although nineteen years had passed and Lin Jincheng’s face was still injured, ye Shu still recognized Lin Jincheng at a glance. ”

“”Ah, Ah Shu,”Lin Jincheng said with a stiff voice. ”

Tears instantly welled up in Ye Shu’s eyes.

It was him.

It was really him.

“After nineteen years of not seeing each other, he seemed to have changed a lot, but it also seemed like nothing had changed. ”

See this.

“Ye Zhuo slightly narrowed his eyes, don’t tell me, this is her that cheap father? ”
