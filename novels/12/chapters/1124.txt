“One word after another, loud and clear. ”

“Zhao Xueyin was stunned, and her face instantly turned pale. ” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

What did ye Zao Mean?

How did she know?

“Before Zhao Xueyin could react, ye Zao’s figure disappeared from the dessert area in front of her. ”

“Zhao Xueyin looked at ye Zao’s figure, and her expression was a little subtle. ”

He should be proud!

She wanted to see how long ye Zao could be proud!

Ye Zao must be so conceited that he thought master five was interested in her.

“After all, a scumbag like her felt that all the men in the world should like her. ”

“In fact, in the eyes of those men, she was just a clown. ”

A disgusting clown.

“Thinking of this, Zhao Xueyin heaved a sigh of relief. ”

She was waiting for the day when ye Zao would become a clown.

“”Xueyin, are you alright?”At this moment, Si Lui’s voice suddenly appeared in the air. ”

“Zhao Xueyin raised her head slightly. The expression on her face instantly returned to normal. She said in a gentle tone, “I’m fine.” ”

Si lui turned to look at Ye Zao’s back. “What did ye Zao say to you just now? Did she bully you?”

Ye Zao was good at scheming.

It could be seen from the clash of clothes.

Zhao Xueyin was not a match for ye Zao at all.

It was not that Zhao Xueyin was not capable enough.

It was that Zhao Xueyin disdained scheming.

A person who disdained scheming would definitely be at a disadvantage in front of a person who was good at scheming.

“”It’s nothing,”Zhao Xueyin said softly. “Actually, Ye Zao is a very easy person to get along with in private. If we were not competitors, perhaps we could become very good friends. Sigh! “What a pity!”At the end of her sentence.., zhao Xueyin sighed. ”

“The more Zhao Xueyin said this, the more the lawyer was worried. A person like ye Zhuo would definitely use Zhao Xueyin’s kindness to deal with Zhao Xueyin. ”

“In this world, not everyone was as kind as Zhao Xueyin. ”

“The lawyer continued, “Xueyin, in the future, don’t interact with her in private. Leave the rest to me.” ”

He would help Zhao Xueyin get rid of all obstacles.

“Zhao xueyin nodded and smiled, “Big Brother Si, I know what to do.” ”

“”Xueyin.”At this moment, a young woman in a wine-red gown walked over. ”

“Zhao Xueyin turned around and said in surprise, “Xiaoyu!” ”

“The person who came was called Jiang Xiaoyu, one of Zhao Xueyin’s good sisters. ”

Jiang Xiaoyu went abroad to study three years ago. Zhao Xueyin didn’t expect to see her at Ye Zhuo’s welcoming banquet tonight.

“Jiang Xiaoyu jogged over and hugged Zhao Xueyin. “Xueyin, long time no see.” ”

“Long time no see.”Zhao Xueyin also hugged Zhao Xueyin tightly.

“After a while, the two of them let go of each other. ”

Zhao Xueyin looked at Jiang Xiaoyu with slightly red eyes. “You’re back. Why didn’t you tell me? I thought I was hearing things!”

“”Didn’t I want to give you a surprise?”Jiang Xiaoyu smiled and said, “I went to your house to look for you. Uncle said you were attending a banquet, so I rushed here without stopping!” ”

“How have you been these three years?”Zhao Xueyin continued to ask.

Jiang Xiaoyu nodded. “Good! Very good!”

“After the two of them finished their small talk, Jiang Xiaoyu realized that Si Lu was also standing there. She turned to greet him. “Brother Si, long time no see.” ”

“Other than smiling at Zhao Xueyin, Si Lu had always had the same expression towards other girls. “Long time no see.” ”

“Jiang Xiaoyu continued, “Three years ago, when I went abroad, you were still single. How is it? Have you found a girlfriend now?” ”

“Zhao xueyin calmly replied, “Xiaoyu, don’t joke around with brother Si. He’s so thin that he can’t help but tease you.” ”

“Jiang Xiaoyu’s gaze shifted between the two of them. With a wicked smile, she said, “Oh! I understand now! Did the two of you get together?” ”

“Hearing that, the lawyer glanced at Zhao Xueyin out of the corner of his eye. ”

Zhao Xueyin furrowed her brows without leaving a trace. This Jiang Xiaoyu was getting more and more inconsiderate when she spoke!

It was like this three years ago!

It was still like this three years later!

How did she know that she and lawyer Si had a lover?

“Zhao Xueyin maintained a smile on her face and turned to look at Jiang Xiaoyu. “It’s not like that. Xiaoyu, don’t talk nonsense!” ”

“Jiang Xiaoyu patted lawyer Si. “Brother Si, what’s going on? Isn’t your speed too slow? I thought that when I came back this time, the two of you would already have a child! I didn’t expect you to still be standing there!” ”

“In other aspects, the lawyer was very strong. ”
