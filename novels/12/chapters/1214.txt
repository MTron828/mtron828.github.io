“Chapter 1215: 257: face-smacking, she was the one everyone expected. Zhao Xueyin was dumbfounded! 3”

“If he had been stubborn, there would not have been such a result. ”

What?

Han Dongliang had woken up now? Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

How was that possible!

How was that possible!

“Even the famous doctors at home and abroad could not cure the death syndrome, so how could ye Zhuo cure it? ”

“If Han Dongliang was really fine, then why did Han Lushan Cry Like That? ”

He would not.

He would not.

“Without an Gong’s bezoar pill, Han Dongliang would not have gotten better. ”

“Zhao Xueyin was stunned on the spot. Her face was ashen, as if she had just died. ”

“Han Laoshan packed his things, turned around and walked out of the door. ”

On the other side.

The Zhao family.

Father Zhao was also stunned when he heard the results of his assistant’s report. His face was full of disbelief.

“No matter how much he thought about it, he did not expect that Han Laoshan would actually choose ye Zhuo in the election. ”

Could it be that Han Laoshan did not want to save Han Dongliang anymore?

Or could it be that Han Dongliang was already fine?

But it had only been three days.

Was Ye Zhuo’s medical skills really that good?

Father Zhao tried his best to calm himself down. He looked up at his assistant. “Go to the Han family and find out what happened!”

“Okay.”The assistant nodded. “I’ll go right away.”

At the Han family’s side.

Han Laoshan rushed home without stopping.

“In the living room, Chen Qiaoye and Mrs. Han were talking about something. To be more accurate, it was Chen Qiaoye who was talking while Mrs. Han was standing at the side wiping her tears. Han Laoshan immediately walked over and asked, “Where’s Dongliang?” ”

“Upon hearing this, Mrs. Han wiped the tears off her face, but she still could not make any sound from her throat. ”

“What happened to Dongliang? Didn’t they say on the phone that Dongliang is fine?”Why was he still crying?

“Seeing Mrs. Han like this, Han Laoshan was a little anxious. ”

Could it be that something had happened again?

“After experiencing great joy, Han Laoshan could no longer withstand great sorrow ”

“Chen Qiaoye smiled and looked at Han Laoshan. “Uncle, don’t worry. Cousin has already woken up!” ”

“Really?”

“Chen Qiaoye nodded. “Right now, Yi Tao is talking to cousin. If you don’t believe me, you can go in and take a look.” ”

Han Laoshan immediately ran into the house.

In the house.

“Yi Tao was sitting by the bed. “Cousin, rest assured and recuperate. With Miracle Doctor Ye around, you will be fine in a few days.” ”

“”En, I believe in Miracle Doctor Ye.”Han dongliang continued, “What kind of person is Miracle Doctor Ye?” ”

“To be able to save a serious patient like him, miracle doctor ye must be very powerful. ”

“Although Han Dongliang had already woken up, he had been sick in bed for a long time. His face did not look good, and his voice was very weak and weak. ”

“Fortunately, there was light in his eyes. ”

“It was pitch-black, like obsidian. ”

It was not as dull and colorless as an ordinary patient.

“Yi Tao continued, “Godly Doctor Ye is very young. I heard from uncle that she is also president ye of the Shunxi Financial Group.” ”

Han Dongliang had been unconscious for a long time and did not know about ye Zhuo. “President? Then who is she?”

Yi Tao shook his head. “I am not very clear about the specific situation.”

“Dongliang!”

“At this moment, Han Laoshan suddenly pounced on him, and tears rolled down his cheeks. ”

Half a year.

A whole half a year.

“During this half a year, Han Dongliang lay on the bed like this. ”

“He was like a vegetable, devoid of any signs of life. ”

He had once thought that Han Dongliang would never be able to call him dad again.

“At this moment, when he saw Han dongliang wake up, Han Laoshan almost thought that he was dreaming. ”

He was filled with emotions.

This kind of feeling of having been lost and regained could not be described with dull words.

“”Dad...”Han Dongliang turned to look at Han Laoshan and asked curiously, “Dad, what happened to you? Why is your hair all white? And My Mom, why did you both age so quickly all of a sudden?” ”

“Although the Han family’s parents were old, they had taken good care of themselves and it was almost impossible to tell their actual age. ”

Han Dongliang did not understand why his parents suddenly looked so old in just a few days.

Especially Mrs. Han.

Even the wrinkles on her face were showing.

Mrs. Han used to look at most 50 years old.

“But now, some people believed that she was 70 years old. ”

“She was unconscious when she was unconscious. Therefore, Han Dongliang only knew that he had slept for many days. He did not know that it had actually been half a year. ”

He also did not know that his parents had been crying almost every day for the past half a year.

“When he heard this, Han Laoshan’s eyes turned even redder. He did not know how to answer Han Dongliang’s question. ”
