He really could not do anything to probe Xu Xiao.

This was because love was all about mutual respect and trust.

“Old Granny Cen rolled her eyes at him. “If you don’t listen to the old man, you’ll suffer a loss in front of your eyes! People like you deserve to be cheated!” ”

“”Your Granny Cen is right, Ziteng. You’ve never been in a relationship before. What if you’re Cheated?”Old Granny he said. ”

“He ziteng sighed helplessly. “Grandma, Grandma Cen, do you think I’ve been eating rice for nothing all these years? Do you think I can’t even tell the difference between good and bad?” ”

He ziteng felt that old Mrs. Cen was a little hesitant.

“After saying that, he ziteng continued, “Grandma Cen, you can’t deny all good girls just because you’ve been cheated by the Mu family before.” ”

“Since he ziteng had said that, what else could grandma Cen Say? ”

Forget it! Forget it!

She still didn’t want to do such an annoying thing.

“Grandma CEN continued, “You’re already an adult. You should think it through. It’s fine as long as you don’t regret it in the future.” ”

“”Don’t worry, Grandma Cen!”He ziteng said. ”

“Grandma Cen looked at He ziteng. “Then, should I push Xiao Chen for you?” ”

He ziteng nodded. “Push it. I’m not suitable for her!”

“That’s fine.”

Old Mrs. Cen stood up from her chair. “Then I’ll take my leave First!”

“Aren’t you going to sit for a while?”Old Mrs. He stood up and asked.

“”No,”old Mrs. Cen continued, “She’s still waiting for my reply!” ”

“”Okay, take care, elder sister.”Old Mrs. He followed behind to see Old Mrs. Cen off. ”

“When they reached the door, old Mrs. Cen suddenly turned to look at Old Mrs. He and asked with a smile, “Do you think my clothes look good today?” ”

“”Yes!”Old Mrs. he said, “It’s LK’s Gao Ding, right?” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen was wearing an improved version of the Cheongsam today. The hem of the dress was embroidered with faint patterns, and it was cut to fit her perfectly. It skillfully brought out old Mrs. Cen’s elegant temperament. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen raised her head and puffed out her chest. With a proud face, she said, “My granddaughter-in-law gave it to me! Look at the patterns, the pattern, and the buttons. They were all designed by my granddaughter-in-law herself!” ”

“Old Mrs. He, who had been shown off, was speechless. She suspected that old Mrs. Cen had come to show off today, but she had no evidence. ”

“Seeing Old Mrs. Cen get into the car, old Mrs. He turned to look at he ziteng. “Let me ask you, is the girl you like as good as your grandmother’s granddaughter-in-law?” ”

“Hearing that, he ziteng said speechlessly, “Grandma, what are you thinking about?” ”

“In this world, who could compare to ye Zao? ”

Old Mrs. He was probably not joking!

“After saying that, he ziteng continued, “Do you know how powerful my goddess is?” ” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Old Mrs. He touched her chin. “Just... Just that powerful?”She had only heard of ye Zao from Old Mrs. Cen. She was not very clear about what ye Zao was like in person.

“”Of course she’s powerful!”He ziteng continued, “My goddess is not only the number one person on the aircraft carrier, she’s also a well-known hacker, Miracle Doctor Ye Who Cures Cancer, the founder of ZY technology...” ”

“Among all these identities of ye Zao, which one of them was not an existence that could make the capital tremble with just a stomp of his feet? ”

“In front of ye Zao, Xu Xiao was a very ordinary girl. ”

Old Madam he was shocked!

No Wonder Old Madam Cen had mentioned her granddaughter-in-law so many times in front of her. It turned out that ye Zao was so powerful!

“After a long while, old madam he sighed, “The CEN family is really blessed in their past life to be able to meet such an outstanding granddaughter-in-law!” ”

“He ziteng smiled and said, “Grandma, don’t worry. Although my future girlfriend is not as powerful as my goddess, she is still a very good girl! I guarantee that you will like her a hundred times after seeing her!” ”

“”En!”Old Lady he nodded. “Actually, I also think that the little girl from the Ouyang family is very good! Why do you just look down on her?” ”

“”We are not from the same world,”he ziteng said. ”

“Old Lady he shook her head helplessly. “Forget it, forget it. I Can’t control you. Your marriage will be decided by nature. Just think about it yourself.” ”

“He ziteng smiled and said, “In any case, I won’t let you down.” ”

“As a grandmother, old lady he trusted he ziteng’s gaze. Since he ziteng did not like Ouyang Chen, it meant that the two of them were really not suitable for each other, this was not the old society where arranged marriages were arranged. She had to respect the child’s opinion. ”

“On the other side, the old woman went to Ouyang’s house. ”
