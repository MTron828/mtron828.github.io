Translator: 549690339

How many years do they have left to wait?

She couldn’t afford to wait!

Lin Qingxuan couldn’t afford to wait either.

“Xia Xiaoman was a person with a clear goal. She believed that if they liked each other, they should follow their hearts and be together. However, if Lin Qingxuan couldn’t get past Old Lady Lin, then there was no need for them to be together. ”

“Lin Qingxuan continued, “Xiaoman, I understand what you’re saying. I hope you can give me more time.” ”

Xia Xiaoman nodded. “Then let’s do it after the New Year. I’m going back to Yun Jing on the first month. I hope that you can give me an accurate answer when I come back from Yun Jing.”

“”Sure!”Lin Qingxuan continued, “My mother likes to play tricks behind my back. If she asks you out or uses money to insult you, please tell me immediately! I don’t want there to be any misunderstanding between us because of my mother!” ”

Lin Qingxuan knew Old Lady Lin too well.

His first girlfriend was scared away by Old Lady Lin in this way.

“No matter what, he couldn’t let her scare Xia Xiaoman away again. ”

“Xia Xiaoman smiled and said, “Don’t worry, I’m not that kind of innocent little girl anymore. I know how to deal with your mother.” ”

“Since Lin Qingxuan had already explained everything, Xia Xiaoman could understand him. ”

“”Xiaoman, thank you.” ”

“Lin Qingxuan turned around and hugged Xia Xiaoman. “Don’t worry. No matter what, I will give you a satisfactory answer.” ”

“Okay.”Xia Xiaoman nodded.

Lin Qingxuan accompanied Xia Xiaoman to walk around the residential area before driving back to the Lin family.

“Lin Qingxuan originally thought that Old Lady Lin would talk to him after he returned home, but strangely, Old Lady Lin did not react at all. ”

This made Lin Qingxuan curious.

Staying put was not old Lady Lin’s style.

Could it be that she had thought it through?

“Today was the 28th of December, and the new year was coming soon, so Lin Qingxuan did not take the initiative to look for Old Lady Lin. He planned to look for Old Lady Lin to clarify things after the New Year’s Eve. ”

“In the blink of an eye, it was the 30th day of the New Year. ”

This year was the first New Year for ye Shu and Ye Zhuo in the Lin family.

Lin Jincheng attached great importance to the mother and daughter spending their first new year in the Lin family.

“In order to make the new year more festive, Lin Jincheng gave all the servants in the family a day off in advance, leaving only the servants who lived in the capital to take care of Old Lady Lin. ”

“As the four brothers, nephews, nephews, and wives of the Lin family were all at home, the Lin family manor was especially lively. ”

“After breakfast in the morning, everyone was busy writing couplets and cutting window flowers in the afternoon. ”

Ye Shu and a few sisters-in-law were busy preparing the New Year’s Eve dinner in the kitchen.

Lin Ze went to fetch ye Sen.

“Apart from ye Shu, Ye Sen had no other relatives in the capital, so Lin Jincheng took the initiative to bring Ye Sen over for the New Year. ”

“Old Madam Lin came to the east courtyard. “Jincheng, come here. I have something to discuss with you.” ”

“Lin Jincheng walked to Old Madam Lin’s side. “Mom, if you have something to say, just say it.” ”

“”Jincheng,””I want to bring Xianxian over to celebrate the new year with us.” ” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“”What?”Lin Jincheng’s face turned cold, thinking that he had heard wrong. ”

Old Mrs. Lin repeated it again.

“Lin Jincheng frowned tightly, he said angrily, “Mom, you know very well what Feng Qianhua did to us! At this time, you actually let Feng Xianxian come to our house for the New Year! Have you ever considered the feelings of us people? !” ”

“Old Mrs. Lin’s face was very ugly, “You also said that those things were all done by Feng Qianhua! What does Feng Qianhua’s actions have to do with Xianxian! Xianxian has never done anything to let our Lin family down! Jin city, did you know that Xianxian almost died the last time she committed suicide!” ”

Old Madam Lin’s heart ached especially when she thought of Feng Xianxian’s suicide.

“After saying that, old madam Lin said again, “Jin City, you also have children. Don’t you feel sorry for Xianxian?” ”

“Ever since Feng Qianhua was sent to prison, the Feng family had chased Feng Xianxian out of the house. Now, apart from her, Feng Xianxian had no other family or friends in the capital. ”

Today was the New Year. Old Madam Lin did not want Feng Xianxian to live alone in the apartment.

“Lin Jin Cheng frowned. “I have a daughter myself. Why should I feel sorry for someone else’s daughter? Mom, I don’t agree with you bringing Feng Xianxian Home for the New Year!” ”

“Old Lady Lin Sighed. “Jincheng, can’t you just take pity on Xianxian?”Old Lady Lin had no idea when Lin Jincheng had become so cold-blooded and heartless! ”

“”I pity her, who will pity me?”Lin Jincheng looked at Old Lady Lin and tried his best to keep his voice low, “Mom, don’t forget that this leg of mine was given to me by Feng Qianhua. My wife and daughter were separated for eighteen years because of Feng Qianhua! And my daughter’s ten-odd years of being an idiot was also given to her by Feng Qianhua!” ”

Lin Jincheng was really angry.

He did not expect that Old Lady Lin would still think of Feng Xianxian at a time like this.

“Old Lady Lin’s eyes were slightly red, “Jincheng, can you please help me out just because I’m already half dead? Xianxian is different from that B * Tch Feng Qianhua. It’s New Year’s Eve today. I don’t want to see that child alone!” ”

“Lin Jincheng took a deep breath. “Mom, don’t say anymore. I Won’t agree to this.” ”

“Jincheng!”

Lin Jincheng didn’t say anything more and turned around to walk into the house.

Old Madam Lin looked at Lin Jincheng’s back and sighed.

“With a wife, he forgot his mother. ”

Lin Jincheng was the best example.

“Lin Jincheng had already become like this. She couldn’t let Lin Qingxuan become a second Lin Jincheng. It seemed that after the new year, she had to settle Lin Qingxuan’s marriage. ”

Find a well-behaved and well-educated daughter of everyone.

Old Lady Lin had a plan in her heart.

“Lin Jincheng returned to the main hall and Lin Qingxuan asked curiously, “Why is mom looking for you?” ”

“It was the new year, so Lin Jincheng did not want Lin Qingxuan to be upset. He continued, “It’s just a small matter. Oh right, fourth brother, shall we go write the couplet now?” ”

“”Okay.”Lin Qingxuan continued, “Write the couplet and burn your feet. The words ‘burn’are really good.” ”

“After saying that, Lin Qingxuan turned around to look for ye Zao. ”

Lin Qingxuan came to the door of ye Zao’s room and knocked on the door. “Burning!”

“Ye Zao’s voice came from inside the room. “Fourth uncle, the door isn’t closed. Please come in.” ”

“Then I’ll come in.”Lin Qingxuan pushed the door open and entered.

“The moment she pushed the door open, she saw ye Zao sitting cross-legged on the floor outside the bedroom. There was a small pile of scattered parts on the carpet. Because it was so disassembled, it was almost impossible to tell what they were. ”

“”Zhuo Zhuo, what are you doing?”Lin Qingxuan asked curiously. ”

“Ye Zhuo said, “There seems to be a problem with the phone. Let me take it apart and have a look.” ”

“Can you put it back after you take it apart?”Lin Qingxuan expressed her doubt.

“”It can be no problem.”Ye Zhuo continued, “Fourth uncle, why did you come to look for me?” ”

“Only then did Lin Qingxuan remember the serious matter. She continued, “We are preparing to write a couplet. We plan to let you come down and show off. Write a couplet and paste it on our front door!” ”

“Sure.”Ye Zao quickened his movements. “I’ll come down immediately after I install the phone.”

“Okay.”Lin Qingxuan nodded. “Then I’ll go down first.”

“Not long after Lin Qingxuan went down, ye Zao came down with the phone. ”

“Seeing ye Zao come down with the phone, Lin Qingxuan said in surprise, “Zao Zao, your phone is installed so quickly?” ”

“He thought that the phone couldn’t be put back in, but he didn’t expect ye Zao to actually put it back in. ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly. He picked up the writing brush beside him and began to write couplets.

“Her handwriting was like the wind, forming a style of its own. The Strokes were like dragons and snakes, which amazed Lin Qingxuan repeatedly. ”

The other members of the Lin family also ran over to watch. “Little Twelve’s handwriting is really good! As expected of Master Yu’s personal disciple!”
