“Chapter 989: 224: face-smacking, Big Ye is still you, Big Ye! 1”

Translator: 549690339

Cao Wei knew Xi Muwen very well.

“Xi Muwen was a wolf with wild ambitions. After he went missing for half a month thirty-six years ago, he only used less than a year to turn the ye group into the XI group.”

“If XI Muwen was really a good father and husband, he wouldn’t have changed the ye group less than a year after his own daughter went missing.”

“Therefore, from Cao Wei’s point of view, this was all XI Muwen’s trap.”

“After all, Aunt Lang still had a big secret.”

It was not easy for ordinary people to enter the financial world.

Aunt Lang was the key to enter the financial world.

“If the Xi family wanted to enter the financial world smoothly and join the Shunxi Financial Group, they had to start from Aunt Lang.”

“Cao Wei narrowed his eyes and continued, “Aunt Lang, I know that you miss your daughter dearly and dream of finding your daughter, but please calm down and think carefully. is that person really half a month old?””

“Aunty Lang did not answer Cao Wei right away. Instead, she turned around and walked out.”

Xi Muwen looked at Aunty Lang’s back and turned around to look at Yang Jiao. They could see the scheming look in each other’s eyes.

Who was the call that Yang Jiao received? Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Since they had been chatting for half a month...

Then the other party must be related to the Shunxi Financial Group.

“After all, the people from the Shunxi Financial Group had already found ye Langhua before this.”

Thank God they were prepared!

“Aunt Lang went outside and looked back into the room. After making sure that she couldn’t hear anything inside, only then suppressed voice way: “Cao Wei, I know what you mean, please rest assured, small half month is my small half month, we have already done the appraisal.””

“Aunt Lang doesn’t trust anyone, but she does trust the report.”

The appraisal report would not lie to her.

“If the half a month in the house was not related to her by blood, then their parent-child relationship would not be established.”

“When she heard this, Cao Wei asked in surprise, “You’ve done the appraisal?””

“”Yes.”Auntie lang nodded and continued, “We just came back from the hospital. The appraisal result shows that we’re biological mother and daughter.””

“”Impossible!”! “That’s impossible!”Cao Wei said anxiously, “Then, have you ever thought that Xi Muwen might have discussed it with the hospital beforehand! ?”! In short, Xi Muwen was not a person to be trusted. Aunty Lang, where are you now? “There are some things that are inconvenient to say over the phone, let’s meet up! “I’m 100% sure that the little half a month Xi Muwen found is definitely not the real little half a month!””

“”Cao Wei, I know your purpose,”aunty lang continued, “It’s been 36 years. Since I didn’t go back 36 years ago, then I’ve already gone back 36 years ago.””

Cao Wei wanted her to return to Shunxi Financial Group.

“However, to Aunty Lang now, those were just worldly possessions. She only wanted to spend the rest of her life with her daughter.”

“She did not want to care about anything else, nor did she want to ask about it”

“Cao Wei said helplessly, “Aunty Lang, not only do I want you to come back, I also don’t want to watch you be cheated by Xi Muwen! Xi Muwen must have a conspiracy! Please don’t believe him!””

“”I don’t care what conspiracy he has. I just want my daughter to come back,”aunty lang continued, “That’s all. I’ll hang up first.””

“Then, Aunt Lang hung up.”

Cao Wei frowned as he looked at the phone being hung up. His face was full of worry.

He thought he could use this opportunity to let Aunt Lang return to the Shunxi Financial Group.

He didn’t expect Xi Muwen to make such a sudden move.

“With the Ye family as the leader, the Shunxi Financial Group was founded by the Ye, Wang, Zhang, and Zhao families.”

“Back then, when the Ye family’s old master was still around, the Shunxi Financial Group firmly occupied the number one position in the financial world.”

“However, ever since Old Master Ye left the financial world, the Shunxi Financial Group was crushed by the rising stars. The Lingtian Financial Group went from number one to number two. All these years, the Lingtian Financial Group had always been the number one financial group, no one had ever surpassed them.”

The main family of the Shunxi Financial Group had also become the Zhao family from the Ye family.

“Now, the Zhao family was an existence that could control the entire Shunxi Financial Group. Not only could they control the entire Shunxi financial group, but the Zhao family also wanted to push the Wang and Zhang families out of the Shunxi Financial Group and take over the Shunxi Financial Group as their own to become an aristocratic family!”

“Ye Langhua was grandfather Ye’s only heir. In this world, only she had the right to join the Shunxi Financial Group and clean up the house for Grandfather Ye. If she did not return and take charge of the overall situation.., the Shunxi Financial Group would really become the Zhao family’s world.”

“At that time, the Shunxi Financial Group would no longer exist in the financial world. The efforts of grandfather Ye and the Wang and Zhang families over the years would also go down the drain.”
