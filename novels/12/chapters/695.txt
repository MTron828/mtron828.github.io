Translator: 549690339

“Hearing this, Xia Xiaoman’s face turned even redder. ”

The sisters-in-law of the Lin family were much easier to get along with than she had imagined. They were not as scheming as depicted in TV dramas or novels.

The sisters-in-law of the Lin family also admired Xia Xiaoman.

“Although they had not been together for long, they could see a positive energy from Xia Xiaoman. ”

“Wu Mei smiled and said, “Alright, Alright. Don’t make fun of fourth brother and Xiaoman. By the way, it’s not easy for the five of us to get together today. Shall we fight the landlord?” ”

“Sure!”

“Thus, the five of them began to fight the landlord. ”

“Seeing Xia Xiaoman and her daughter getting along so well with their family members, Lin Qingxuan was very happy. He was most afraid that Xia Xiaoman and an Lizi wouldn’t be able to integrate into the big family like the Lin family. ”

“Now, it seemed that his worries were unnecessary. ”

Old Mrs. Lin looked over and was a little angry.

Her daughters-in-law were all more insensible than the last.

“They did not even check whether Xia Xiaoman was worthy of marrying into the Lin family, but pulled Xia Xiaoman along to fight the landlord together. ”

They really did not have the slightest discernment!

Especially Wu Mei!

She was the eldest daughter-in-law of the Lin Family!

How could she not even have the boldness of a eldest daughter-in-law?

Old Lady Lin looked at the person who was fighting the landlord and wished that she could walk over and flip over the Mahjong Table!

“Just as Lin Qingxuan saw that Xia Xiaoman was getting along so well with the sisters-in-law of the family and the burden on her heart finally settled, Old Lady Lin walked over to Lin Qingxuan’s side and her expression was a little ugly, “Qingxuan, come with me.” ”

“Seeing Old Mrs. Lin like this, Lin Qingxuan was mentally prepared. “Okay.” ”

Lin Qingxuan followed Old Mrs. Lin into the house.

“When they came into the house, Old Mrs. Lin’s expression suddenly became serious. “Fourth brother, let me ask you, where is Xia Xiaoman from?” ”

“She’s from Yun Jing.”

Yun Jing.

Yun Jing again.

Old Mrs. Lin frowned. Did she have a grudge against Yun Jing in her previous life?

Why were her sons one after another bewitched by the women from Yun Jing? Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

What kind of good woman could be raised in a small place like Yun Jing?

Ye Shu was a good example.

“As long as Ye Shu was sensible, she would not take Qiao and not forgive her. ”

“Therefore, Old Mrs. Lin was very dissatisfied with Xia Xiaoman. ”

She was dissatisfied in all aspects!

“Just based on the fact that Xia Xiaoman was from Yun Jing, she would not be able to marry into the Lin family. ”

“Old Mrs. Lin tried her best to suppress the anger in her heart and asked, “She’s getting married for the second time?” ”

“Yes.”Lin Qingxuan nodded.

“”Muddle-headed!”Old Mrs. Lin snorted and berated, “Qingxuan! You’re too muddle-headed! You’re from a famous family after all, how can you marry a second-hand? !” ”

Second-hand woman?

Hearing this term.

“Lin Qingxuan’s face turned cold, “Mom! What are you talking about? Xiaoman isn’t a second-hand woman! She’s the one I want to spend the rest of my life with! I won’t allow you to talk about her like that!” ”

“I don’t agree to this!”Old Lady Lin’s attitude was firm.

“Lin Qingxuan continued, “Mom, whether you agree or not, I want to be with Xiaoman. I brought Xiaoman back today to inform you, not to ask for your permission.” ”

“Having had a failed relationship before, even if Old Lady Lin were to break the sky, he would not separate from Xia Xiaoman. ”

“For the rest of his life, Lin Qingxuan wanted to live for himself. ”

“This time, he would not compromise for anyone! ”

“Seeing Lin Qingxuan’s firm attitude, Old Lady Lin frowned. “Then let me ask you again, how old is Xia Xiaoman this year?” ”

“”She’s one year younger than me,”Lin Qingxuan answered truthfully. ”

One year younger?

Old Lady Lin’s frown deepened. “She’s already forty-one years old! Can she still spread her wings for our Lin Family?”

Lin Qingxuan’s biggest problem now was that she did not have any children.

“As a mother, Old Lady Lin knew that Lin Qingxuan also wanted to have a child of her own. When she thought of this, her voice softened a few degrees, then, she said, “Qingxuan, in the first half of your life, it was that B * Tch Zhao shuning who delayed you. Don’t you want to have a child of your own in the second half of your life? “Mom knows that you like Xia Xiaoman, but Xia Xiaoman is already forty-one years old this year. She doesn’t suit you at all!” ”

“Lin Qingxuan knew what Old Lady Lin meant, “Mom, aren’t you the one who held me back? “If you hadn’t forced me to be with Zhao shuning back then, I wouldn’t have gotten to this point. I’ve already made up my mind to be with Xiaoman. No matter what you say, you can’t stop us from being together!” ”
