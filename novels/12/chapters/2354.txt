Translator: 549690339

She shouldn’t have been in such a passive position.

She and Lin Ze should be a couple!

“But now, Lin Ze directly ignored her. ”

That’s right.

“From Lin Ze’s point of view, what he did seemed right. After all, it was her fault, and Lin Ze should have blamed her. If she hadn’t rejected Lin Ze in the beginning, Lin Ze wouldn’t have become like this. ”

Lin Ze was taking revenge on her.

“Bai Mo bit her lip and didn’t say anything. She just looked at Lin Ze’s back, her eyes filled with regret. She regretted why she had rejected Lin Ze in the first place, and even more regretted pushing Bai Jingshu to Lin Ze’s side. ”

The surrounding guests who were watching the show didn’t expect that Lin Ze would actually be the chosen successor of Old Lady Shangguan.

The expression in their eyes became very complicated at this moment.

“Shock, disbelief... ”

“Old Lady Shangguan smiled at Old Master Bai, then she said, “Old Master Bai, from now on, we are in-laws. Ah Ze is the successor of our Shangguan family, and Miss Bai is the future mistress of our Shangguan family. Don’t worry, our Shangguan family will not let Miss Bai down in the future!” ”

“”Grandma?”Lin Ze looked at Old Lady Shangguan. He was about to say something, but was stopped by Old Lady Shangguan, “Ah Ze, I know what you want to tell me. I have made up my mind. You are definitely the heir! Our Shangguan family will depend on you from now on! “I also took advantage of today’s Big Day to announce this news to everyone. Some snobs have clearly seen that Lin Ze is the future head of our F galaxy’s Shangguan family! “Anyone who makes things difficult for Lin Ze will be making things difficult for the entire Shangguan family!” ”

“When these words were said, the crowd fell silent. ”

The Wheel of fortune was really turning!

Who would have thought that a lowly person from Earth could suddenly become the unattainable heir of the Shangguan family.

It was like a dream.

“After saying this, Old Lady Shangguan looked at Cen Shaoqing and Ye Zhuo beside Lin Ze and smiled. “Oh right, this must be Mr. Cen and Miss Ye?” ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded politely. “Old Mrs. Shangguan.”

“Ye Zao nodded as well. “Hello, Old Mrs. Shangguan.” ”

“”What Old Lady? We’re all on the same side!”Old Mrs. Shangguan continued, “You’re Ah Ze’s sister, and you’re Ah Ze’s future brother-in-law. The two of you are like my granddaughter and future grandson-in-law. If you don’t mind, you can just call me Grandma.” ”

“”Grandma Shangguan,”ye Zao said, “Then you don’t have to be polite with me. You can just call me by my name.” ”

Old Lady Shangguan Liked Ye Zao’s graciousness. “Then I’ll call you Zao Zao just like Ah Ze.”

“As soon as she said that, Old Lady Shangguan was about to ask ye Zao if he had a boyfriend. If he didn’t, she would introduce one to ye Zao. At that moment, she suddenly remembered that Cen Shaoqing was ye Zao’s boyfriend, she quickly stopped what she was about to say. ”

“Bai Mo stood at the side with an envious look on her face. If she had not rejected Lin Ze, then she would be the one who came to give Lin ze the betrothal gifts. ”

Things did not turn out as she had hoped.

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded.

“Old Lady Shangguan’s personality was very similar to Old Lady Cen’s. Her good-looking skin was the same, and the interesting ones were one in a million. As long as she was the one she had set her eyes on, she would never change her mind. ”

“”Ah Ze, let’s not just stand there. Let’s go pick up the bride! The bride must be waiting anxiously!”Old Lady Shangguan continued. ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Yes, let’s hurry up and pick up sister-in-law.” ” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Only then did the onlookers remember that they were here to attend the wedding. They could not help but turn from watching the excitement to being envious.

They were really envious.

They had thought that Bai Jingshu was a fool who could marry anyone but a lowly earthling.

But now...

Lin Ze had transformed from an ordinary earthling into the dazzling heir of the Shangguan family. The clown was actually them!

How could there be a heaven-chosen daughter like Bai Jingshu in the world? !

Lin Ze walked all the way to Bai Jingshu’s room.

The Bai family’s wedding could be said to be extremely deserted.

Bai Jingshu didn’t even get a bridesmaid.

That was because Bai Jingshu only married an earthling.

“In the S Galaxy, who would lower themselves to be a bridesmaid for an earthling? ”

“She found two classmates in a row, but both of them rejected her. ”

“Because there were no bridesmaids blocking the way, Lin Ze walked straight into the room. ”

“Jingshu.”

“”Well.”White Jingshu looked up at Linze, eyes seemed to be full of starlight. ”
