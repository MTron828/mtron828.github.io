“Therefore, he understood man Xing. ”

“Hearing this, Zhao Dan looked at man Jiangshan in disbelief. “Do you know what you’re talking about? !” ”

Ten years! That was ten years!

Was she really going to stay in this godforsaken place for ten years?

She couldn’t do it!

“Man Jiangshan looked at Zhao Dan. “I know what I’m talking about! If you don’t want to hold back the star, then shut up!” ”

Zhao Dan was a little confused by man Jiangshan’s intentions. “What on Earth are you doing?”

“Man Jiangshan ignored Zhao Dan and turned to look at man Xing, “Xing ‘er, you must not be influenced by your mother. Listen to your father and pass the election peacefully. Your mother and I will take good care of ourselves inside. You Don’t have to worry about us!” ”

“Man Xing looked at man Jiangshan, her eyes slightly red. She continued, “Father and mother, don’t worry. I will think of a way to bring you out earlier.” ”

“No matter what, these were the parents who gave birth to her and raised her. Man Xing could not remain indifferent. ”

“”Xing ‘er, you must not do anything stupid! Don’t be influenced by your mother’s words.”Man Jiangshan continued, “Actually, the real situation is not as scary as your mother said. This is also a kind of growth!” ”

“MAN XING continued, “Dad, don’t worry. With master around, I know what to do. I will definitely save you and mom without affecting myself.” ”

“”Mm.”Man Jiangshan heaved a sigh of relief. “Xing ‘er, you’re right. If I’m not by your side, ask Master Cao about everything. Don’t do anything stupid!” ”

“I know.”Man Xing nodded.

“Walking out of the prison, man Xing took a deep breath and wiped away her tears. ”

“Seeing her come out, the special assistant immediately walked over. “Miss, do we still have to follow the plan?” ” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Man Xing hesitated for a moment. Her parents’faces appeared in front of her eyes, and then master Cao’s instructions rang out. After a moment, she finally nodded and said, “Follow the plan.” ”

One wrong step led to another.

“Master Cao was right. Ascending the throne was only her first step. If she had even taken the wrong step, how could she continue down this path? ”

“Man Jiangshan and Zhao Danrong had been rich for their entire lives, and they had already enjoyed the benefits they deserved. How many people in this world could live like them? ”

“They had lived their lives to this point, and they had not lost anything! ”

“Okay.”

“After Man Xing left, the special assistant immediately reported the situation to master Cao. ”

“Hearing this, the corners of master Cao’s mouth curled up. “Xing ‘er has really grown up.” ”

He was very pleased!

“Three days later, the news of Man Jiangshan and Zhao Danrong’s sudden deaths suddenly spread out from the interstellar prison. ”

“According to the reports, the sudden deaths of the husband and wife were not a coincidence. Instead, someone had maliciously poisoned them for revenge. ”

“After the sudden death of the two, the murderer went to the police station to surrender himself. ”

“For a moment, everyone on the starnet sighed. ”

“[ oh my God! This is too sudden. Although these two people deserved it, I am not ready yet! ] ”

[ I can only say that evil has its own retribution. ]

[ I feel that things are not that simple! Is it really a malicious act of revenge? What grudge does the person who poisoned have with the entire family? ]

“[ I also feel that things aren’t that simple. No matter what, Man Jiangshan is the former president of Manxing country. They are different from ordinary criminals. If there wasn’t any secret operation, they wouldn’t have been poisoned to death so easily. ] ”

[ I’ve checked. The person who poisoned the entire family does indeed have a huge grudge. His motive is very strong! All of you are so good at talking. Even the superintendent’s side is fine. You guys have been possessed by a godly detective! ]

“When Man Xing heard the news, he immediately fainted. His assistant immediately sent her to the hospital. ”

Man Wen was also a little surprised.

He never thought that his parents would be poisoned to death in prison.

Fan Mu frowned slightly and looked at man Wen. “Do you think it’s Miss Ye?”

“No!”Man Wen directly denied it. “It can’t be her!”

“Fan Mu continued, “Why not? Your parents have done so many things to let her down. It’s normal for it to be her! If we were her, I wouldn’t be able to swallow this!”If it was really ye Zhuo who did it.., fan Mu could understand. ”

“”If she had the intention to kill, she wouldn’t have waited until now,”man Wen continued. ”

“Fan Mu felt that man Wen’s analysis was reasonable. After all, with Ye Zhuo’s methods, there was no need for her to hide it. ”

“Then who is it?”Fan Mu asked.

“At this moment, fan mu suddenly thought of something. “It can’t be elder Wu, right? I remember that elder Wu had a conflict with your father in the early years. Could it be that he hired someone to kill him?” ”
