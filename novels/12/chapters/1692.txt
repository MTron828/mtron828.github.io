“Song Shiyu’s gaze swept past the police car without a trace, and he frowned slightly. ”

“Then, he took out his phone and sent a message. ”

“Bai Jiayu stood beside song Shiyu and said curiously, “Third brother, there’s something wrong with you.” ”

“What’s Wrong?”Song Shiyu’s tone was low.

“”There’s nothing wrong.”Bai Jiayu continued, “First of all, why are you suddenly concerned about Tong Tong? Second, who were you texting just now?” ”

“Song Shiyu was a cold-blooded person. Even when Old Madam song was still alive, she rarely received his concern. ”

Not to mention this cousin who only had a quarter of her blood relationship with him.

“Besides, song Shiyu had never been one to lower his head. ”

“But today, he kept looking down at his phone. ”

“What do I need to explain to you?”Song Shiyu’s tone was low.

“”There’s no need to explain. I just feel that you’re quite strange,”Bai Jiayu continued, “Third brother, sometimes I feel that you’re not the same person as before. But sometimes I feel that you’ve never changed.” ”

This feeling was very strange.

Especially in the recent period.

“The last time he returned from C Nation, song Shiyu suddenly brought back a cat. ”

And he was especially good to that cat.

“He gave the cat a nanny, a villa, and even a special car. ”

One had to know that the song Shiyu of the past was not someone who liked cats.

“When song Shiyu carried the cat, Bai Jiayu felt that he was no longer the bloodthirsty song Shiyu. ”

One could even describe him as gentle and elegant.

“But when he was treating Mu Yourong, song Shiyu had returned to his previous appearance. ”

“His methods were vicious and incomparably sinister, like a demon that had crawled out of Hell. ”

“”Third brother,”Bai Jiayu continued, “You suddenly became like this, is it because of that girl who made you keep your virginity like Jade? Who Is She?” ”

Song Shiyu didn’t say anything and just looked into the distance.

“Brother Jiayu!”

“At this moment, Mu Tong ran toward Bai Jiayu. ”

“Tong Tong!”Bai Jiayu’s expression immediately changed when he saw Mu Tong.

“”Brother Jiayu, did you and third brother wait here for another two hours?”Mu Tong asked. ”

“Bai Jiayu nodded and continued, “What do you want to Eat Tonight? Brother Jiayu will take you there.” ”

“”I want to eat Kanto Cook...”after saying that, he turned to look at song Shiyu and asked hesitantly, “Can I?” ” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“No.”Song Shiyu directly refused.

“OH.”Mu Tong nodded.

“Bai Jiayu looked at song Shiyu. “Tong Tong just wants to eat Kanto Cook. Why Can’t you? Third brother, you’re too inhumane!” ”

“Unhygienic.”Song Shiyu had a serious mysophobia and rejected all roadside stalls.

“Bai Jiayu wanted to say more, but Mu Tong pulled his hand and said, “Brother Jiayu, forget it.” ”

“”Jiayu, Tong Tong.”A pleasant voice suddenly appeared in the air. ”

Bai Jiayu and Mu Tong looked up and saw that it was Chen Siyan.

“Sister Siyan.”Bai Jiayu and Mu Tong called for her.

“Chen siyan smiled and said, “You haven’t eaten yet, right?” ”

“Bai Jiayu said, “Yes, we are discussing where to eat! Tong wants to eat Guan Dong’s cooking, but third brother won’t let her.” ”

“Chen Siyan glanced at song Shiyu and continued, “Guan Dong’s cooking isn’t hygienic. Why Don’t you go to my place? I’ll Cook Myself.” ”

“Sure!”Bai Jiayu and Mu Tong said at the same time.

“Song Shiyu looked at his watch and said, “You two go ahead. I have other things to do.” ”

“Hearing that, the light in Chen Siyan’s eyes gradually disappeared. ”

“Bai Jiayu said, “Third brother, what do you have to do? You can go after eating!” ”

“”No, you guys go ahead.”After saying that, song Shiyu walked to the car. ”

“Watching song Shiyu leave, Bai Jiayu continued, “Third brother must have something important to do. Sister Siyan, don’t think too much about it.” ”

“Chen siyan smiled and said, “I know. Let’s go too.” ”

Bai Jiayu and mu tong followed Chen Siyan’s footsteps.

On the other side.

At the police station.

“A few police officers took notes for Ye Zhuo, Lin Sha, and Zou Feifei. ”

Ye Zhuo came out of his office after taking notes.

“When she came to the hall, Lin Sha and Zou Feifei were already waiting for her. ”

“Lin Sha stood up and asked, “Zhuo Zhuo, did they tell you anything?” ”

“Ye Zhuo shook his head slightly, “It’s just some routine questions. “But I heard a police officer say that the surveillance camera of the restaurant where we ate at noon was hacked for ten minutes. As long as we get back the surveillance video of those ten minutes, we’ll know how you got poisoned.” ”
