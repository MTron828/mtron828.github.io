“Zheng Ziqiao?”Bai Mo asked again.

“Not yet. Guess again.”Bai Yuanyuan shook her head again.

“I don’t want to guess anymore. Tell me yourself.”Bai Mo couldn’t be bothered to play word games with Bai Yuanyuan.

“Bai Yuanyuan continued, “It’s Lin Ze.” ”

“What?”Bai Mo was very surprised. He thought he heard wrong.

She had thought that Bai Jingshu had found an excellent boyfriend. She had not expected that it would be Lin Ze.

This was the biggest joke in the world!

“Bai Yuanyuan smiled and said, “How is it? Are You in disbelief now? “In the beginning, I was also in disbelief. Look at how cold and aloof Bai Jingshu is usually. She even looks like she doesn’t like anyone. In the end, she actually chose such a boyfriend. This is really hilarious!” ”

An Earthling?

Bai Jingshu was probably the first person in the history of the s galaxy to marry an earthling.

“If this news were to spread, how would the Bai family lose face? ”

Bai Mo looked at Bai Yuanyuan. “Is this news reliable? is Bai Jingshu’s boyfriend really Lin Ze?”

“Don’t worry.”Bai Yuanyuan patted her chest. “It’s guaranteed to be reliable!”

“How did you know?”Bai Mo asked.

“Bai Yuanyuan continued, “Bai Jingshu came back today. She told Grandpa herself. Sister-in-law Wang, who takes care of Grandpa, told me all this.” ”

“Sister-in-law Wang?”Bai Mo asked.

“Bai Yuanyuan explained, “Sister-in-law Wang is from the same hometown as our sister-in-law’s sanitary aunt. I greeted her and asked her to keep a close eye on Grandpa and Bai Jingshu. So she came to tell me the news as soon as she heard it! “Then, I came to tell you!” ”

“”I see,”Bai Mo continued, “Then what did Grandpa Say?” ”

“Bai Mo knew that Bai Jingshu listened to Grandpa Bai the most. If Grandpa Bai objected to her being with Lin Ze, Bai Jingshu would definitely listen to him obediently. ”

They couldn’t let Grandpa Bai Ruin Things Now.

“”Grandpa didn’t object, but he told Bai Jingshu to be careful and not let Lin Ze cheat her,”Bai Yuanyuan said. ”

Bai Mo heaved a sigh of relief when he heard this.

This was great!

“She had thought that elder Bai would object, but he did not. ”

Bai Jingshu had always been on top of Bai Mo. she had finally lost in the marriage!

Although Lin Ze was ye Zhuo’s brother in name.

He did not have any real power at all.

“All women married their chickens and dogs. From now on, Bai Jingshu could only be a lowly earthling. ”

“When she thought of this, Bai Mo felt extremely happy. ”

He did not expect Bai Jingshu to have such a day.

“Come to think of it, this was the so-called saying that extreme intelligence was bound to hurt, right? ”

Anyone with a bit of brains would not marry an earthling.

So what if Bai Jingshu was more beautiful than her?

“No matter how beautiful she was, she would only be like this for the rest of her life. ”

“”If I had to say, Bai Jingshu is also stupid and shallow. She must have taken a fancy to Lin Ze’s identity as Miss Ye’s older brother!”Bai Yuanyuan continued, “But she’s only worthy of picking up your broken shoes.” ”

“Ye Han had introduced Bai Mo to Lin Ze before, but Bai Mo did not take a liking to Lin Ze. Wasn’t this just a broken shoe? ”

Bai Jingshu was also brainless. No wonder she lost to Bai Mo..

Bai Mo’s face was full of smiles. “Who else knows about this news now?” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“”I only told you,”Bai Yuanyuan said. ”

Bai Mo narrowed his eyes. “Good news naturally has to be shared with the world. How can I know it by myself?”

Bai Yuanyuan immediately understood what Bai Mo meant. “I think the most important thing is to let Manwen know.”

“Under Bai Yuanyuan’s intentional manipulation, soon, everyone knew that Bai Jingshu had found an earthling as her boyfriend. ”

“In the s galaxy, this was considered big news. ”

“For thousands of years, there had never been a girl from the s galaxy who had married down to Earth. ”

“For a moment, everyone was discussing and speculating whether Bai Jingshu had gone mad. ”

“When the Bai family’s parents found out about this, they were even more shocked and immediately went to the old mansion. ”

“Old Master Bai stood in the main hall and said angrily, “What did I say last time? Jingshu has nothing to do with you two bastards in the future! How can you still have the face to come here!” ”

“In the Bai family, Old Master Bai never said anything in anger. The last time he said that he wanted Bai Jiasheng and Zhou Ying to break off their relationship with Jingshu, he was not joking. ”

“If she followed such parents, sooner or later, she would be dragged down. ”

“”Dad, what are you talking about! ! “No matter what, we are Jingshu’s biological parents. No matter what, we can’t just watch Jingshu dating an Earthling,”Bai Jiasheng continued. “Dad, do you know that Bai Mo picked Lin Ze to be left behind! ! “How can you give us Jingshu trash that even Bai Mo doesn’t want! “Are you Jingshu’s biological grandfather or not? !” ”
