“The next second, ‘Zhou Qing’and a guard walked out with the heavily injured ‘Joey’. ”

“Do you know her?”Qiu Di asked.

Ye Han looked at Joey and shook his head.

Qiu Di handed ye Han a gun. “Finish her.”

“Ye Han took the gun and walked over, pressing it against Joey’s head. ”

Sun Xiao Qian’s expression did not change.

It seemed that ye Han had not recovered his consciousness.

“Otherwise, when he saw ‘Joey,’he would not have such an expression. ”

The next second.

Bang!

A bloody hole suddenly appeared on Joey’s head.

“Looking at it like that, it was very shocking! ”

Ye Han did not hesitate at all and directly fired the gun.

It was as simple as slaughtering a chicken.

He raised his gun and fired.

Qiu Di was very satisfied with Ye Han’s performance.

“Qiu Chang Zhen, who was at the side, also heaved a sigh of relief. ”

“In Ye Han’s eyes, he did not see the slightest problem. ”

This meant that Ye Han was still the same ye Han from before.

“”Bring him out,”Qiu di said. ”

“”Yes.”Sun Xiao Fu nodded and walked out with the guards, carrying Joey. ”

“Ye Han continued, “Eldest miss, do you have any other orders?” ”

“”You can leave too,”autumn flute said slowly. ”

PA —

“At this moment, a tearing pain came from ye Han’s head. ”

His expression was absent-minded.

“But very quickly, this pain disappeared. ”

Ye Han pressed his temples. He didn’t think too much and continued to walk out.

“Looking at Ye Han’s back, Qiu di turned to look at Qiu Chang Zhen, “Father, how is it?” ”

“Qiu Chang Zhen nodded, “It seems that the Great Witch Doctor’s Gu Worms are indeed very powerful!” ”

“If it was the Qiu Han from before, even if he was acting, he would not have really killed Joey. ”

But the current ye Han did not have any reaction at all!

“Saying this, Qiu Chang Zhen asked worriedly, “How are you going to explain things to Ye Lan?” ”

“Explain what?”Qiu Di asked.

“Qiu Changzhen said, “Ye Lan hasn’t been able to receive a reply from Manxing Kingdom. She will definitely be suspicious! How are you going to resolve this matter?” ”

“Qiu di said indifferently, “The ye family’s base is already surnamed Qiu. Can Ye Lan still stir up trouble?” ”

“Aren’t you afraid that she will expose you?”Qiu Changzhen asked.

“”Expose me?”Qiu Di’s face was full of disdain. “Father, who do you think will believe the words of a crazy woman?” ”

Only a crazy woman would say that she was the Manxing Kingdom’s Princess!

Qiu Changzhen nodded.

“After ye Lan returned, she gathered everyone in the base and announced this news. ”

“”From now on, Miss Qiu is the base’s top management!” ”

“”Chief Ye, What About You?”A technician asked, “Where are you going?” ”

“Ye Lan smiled and said, “As for me, I’ll keep it a secret for now. Everyone will see it in a few days.” ”

“At that time, she would be the Glorious Full Moon Princess! ”

She would make everyone’s eyes light up!

“”Chief Ye, are you leaving the base?” ”

Ye Lan nodded.

“Hearing this, everyone discussed animatedly, guessing where Ye Lan was going. ”

“Seeing this, Ye Lan’s lips curled up slightly. ”

Probably no one would have thought that she would be the princess of the Manxing Kingdom.

...

“Ye Zhuo stood in front of the experiment table. At this moment, Yi Ling flew in from outside the window. ”

“Great Burning!”

Ye Zhuo took off his mask. “What’s Wrong?”

“Yi Ling continued, “I found a secret passage in the sixth clan leader’s home.” ”

“Secret Passage?”Ye Zao’s beautiful eyes narrowed.

“”Yes.”Yi Ling continued, “In any case, it’s quite strange. Do you want to go and take a look? It just so happens that the sixth clan leader isn’t at home right now.” ”

“Ye Zao took off his gloves, “Okay.” ”

“Very soon, ye Zao and Yi Ling arrived at the sixth clan leader’s house. ”

“Ye Zao took out his portable computer, and his ten fingers rapidly operated on the CD. In less than five minutes, he changed the monitoring system and defense system of the entire house. ”

“Can we go in now?”Yi Ling asked.

“Wait a little longer.”Ye Zao pressed the pause button. “There is also a hidden monitor.”

Yi Ling frowned slightly. “This sixth clan leader is really guilty of doing too many things!”Who would install so many monitors in the house for no reason?

Wasn’t he afraid of radiation?

“Three minutes later, ye Zao put away his laptop and stood up. “We can go now.” ”

Yi Ling immediately flew into ye Zao’s backpack.

Ye Zao avoided one servant after another and came to the place where Yi Ling discovered the secret passage.

What surprised ye Zao was that this was actually the office of the six clan leaders.

Ye Zao had also come here twice.

“But the previous two times, ye Zao did not find anything wrong. ”

“As expected, the most dangerous place was the safest place. Who would have thought that there would be an unknown secret passage in the office! ”
