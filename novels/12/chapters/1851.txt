Translator: 549690339

Ye Zhuo took the cup of water he handed over and drank a mouthful of water. The clear water entered his throat and eased the thirst in his throat.

“After a while, Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips opened slightly. “Did you get anything today?” ”

“”Yes.”Ye Zhuo looked at Cen Shaoqing and continued, “Now I can basically confirm that my memory has been messed up. Actually, I’m not from the future world, but from another world.” ”

The time dimension of her world was the same as Earth’s.

The only difference was that the civilization of Chang Yue was much higher than Earth’s.

“Based on the initial analysis, it could be concluded that the current space civilization of Chang Yue was Level 5. ”

Earth was a level 1 civilization.

“Ye Zhuo took another sip of water and continued, “The world I used to live in was planet E-TY889 outside the Milky Way.” ”

“E-TY889?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Are there any other clues?”Cen Shaoqing continued to ask.

“Ye Zao said, “There are no other clues for the time being, but this time, I saw ye Han’s face clearly.” ”

“Your younger brother?”

“”Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly and continued, “Can I continue to hypnotize tomorrow?” ”

“At this rate, ye Zao would soon be able to recover all of his memories. ”

“No.”Cen Shaoqing shook his head slightly.

“Ye Zao asked, “Why?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing explained, “Hypnosis requires a lot of effort. After today, you will have to wait at least half a month before you can do it again.” ”

Ye Zao looked at Cen Shaoqing. “Aren’t you going to consider using a backdoor for me?”

Cen Shaoqing smiled slightly. The corners of his mouth curled up beautifully. He lowered his head and lightly pecked her red lips.

“What are you doing?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyes slightly.

“Cen Shaoqing said seriously, “Using a backdoor.” ”

Ye Zhuo:”? ? ?”

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Other people who come to me to hypnotize me don’t receive this kind of treatment.” ”

“”I’m serious with you,”ye Zhuo said. ”

“”I’m serious too,”Cen Shaoqing continued, “Haste makes waste.” ”

Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly. “You really can’t do it?”

“CEN Shaoqing said, “No.” ”

“If he continued to hypnotize him, even a strong body would not be able to withstand it, not to mention that ye Zao was still a girl. ”

“Seeing that he did not show any mercy, ye Zao stood on Tiptoe and took the initiative to hook his neck. He offered his red lips to him and slowly sucked on them like a child who was greedy for ice cream. He was obviously inexperienced, but it made people’s blood boil and it was difficult for them to control themselves. ”

Only Liu Xiahui would be indifferent when a beauty was in her arms.

“Cen Shaoqing wrapped his arms around her waist from behind and moved her lips away. His breath was a little out of breath. “Leader, this is not good.” ”

“What about this?”Ye Zao’s Red Lips moved down and finally stuck to his Adam’s apple.

“According to romance novels, Adam’s apple was the most sensitive position for a man. ”

“Therefore, ye Zao wanted to give it a try. ”

“Thinking of this, Ye Zao did the same. He opened his mouth and took a bite. ”

“It was neither light nor heavy, just right on the spot. ”

“Cen Shaoqing was stunned. He sucked in a breath of cold air. He could still hold himself back, but at this moment, it was like a flood that had been opened to release a flood. How could he still have the slightest bit of his usual calm and self-control? ”

“If it were any other time, Cen Shaoqing would have finished reciting the heart cleansing mantra several times in his heart. ”

“However, today, even if he recited the heart cleansing mantra ten times or a hundred times, it would be useless, let alone one. ”

“Cen Shaoqing hugged the troublemaker in front of him and placed her on the desk. Then, he cupped her face with both hands and kissed her fiercely. His voice was low and hoarse, and his deep eyes were as dark as ink. He could not see the end of it, “Ancestor, you are trying to kill me.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing was a little unfamiliar with this kind of person. He was like a ferocious beast that was hunting, as if he could give a fatal blow at any time. ”

Ye Zao was a little stunned.

“The romance novels only taught her how to light a fire, but they did not teach her how to extinguish it. ”

It seemed that Cen Shaoqing was quite angry.

“It’s over, it’s over. ”

What should I do now?

Ye Zao bit his lips.

“It was just a very casual action, but in Cen Shaoqing’s eyes, it became a fatal temptation. Cen Shaoqing swallowed his throat, and his sexy Adam’s apple moved along with it. ”

“Ye Zao thought that it was not good. In the next second, he pushed Cen Shaoqing away, jumped off the desk, and jogged out of the study room. ” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Cen Shaoqing looked back slightly and looked at ye Zao’s back, his eyes filled with helplessness. ”

This little heartless man.

“He ran all the way to the door, but ye Zao’s heart was still beating wildly. ”

“Thump, thump. ”

He almost couldn’t control himself.

“After a few seconds of silence, ye Zao walked downstairs. ”
