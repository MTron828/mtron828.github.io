Chapter 28: What Sort Of Torment Is This?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Have it here? For… for real?

Li Qiandong’s knees buckled.

Suddenly, the door to the reserved room was pushed open, and a servant entered the room with a tray of pork intestines.

It was very fresh, with blood still seeping from it. One could even smell the strange fishy stench from ten meters away.

“Let’s begin.” Cen Shaoqing then rubbed the prayer beads in an exceedingly slow motion.

Meanwhile, his tone was exceedingly nonchalant.

“Brother Fifth…” Li Qiandong was even stuttering from anxiety. “I thought you, you, you are a vegetarian? I… I shall become a vegetarian to accompany you from, from, from now on!”

Cen Shaoqing took a glance at him and said, “A real man keeps his promise and is firm in his action.”

Li Qiandong stepped forward and walked to the front of the table with great difficulty before he took a seat. “Brother Fifth…”

“Eat.”

It was only a simple word, yet it made Li Qiandong lose the courage to decline. He picked up a piece of bloodied pork intestine with his chopsticks numbly, shut his eyes, crossed his heart, and stuffed it into his mouth.

The taste… was really f*cking awful!

However, Li Qiandong still endured it and swallowed it down. Sadly, right after that, his stomach began to churn frantically. Then, he hastily ran to the washroom and wished that he could vomit his gallbladder out.

Cen Shaoqing then stood up and furrowed his brows ever so slightly. “Keep the rest for the live stream then.”

Upon saying that, he turned around and left the room.

Li Qiandong was confused.

Shouldn’t Cen Shaoqing have said, ‘There’s no need to eat the rest’? ...did he mishear it?

Brother Fifth was a devoted Buddhist who was kind-hearted beyond comparison. Since that was the case, how could Cen Shaoqing possibly bear to watch him eat the raw pork intestines?

He was certain that he misheard that.

Right!

At the thought of that, Li Qiandong was relieved. He washed his face calmly and then left the gambling house.

But just as he was heading out, the gambling house’s manager came running after him while gasping for breath. “Please hold on, Mr. Li.”

“What’s going on?”

The gambling house’s manager passed a bag to Li Qiandong. “Mr. Li, this is the pork intestines that Master Fifth had us wrap for you. He wanted me to remind you to stream yourself for his audience upon your return.”

Li Qiandong was rendered speechless. What sort of torment was this?

…

It was the day for Ye Zhuo’s follow-up consultation with Chen Qiaoye’s husband.

After one week of consuming the prescribed medicine and a period of recuperation, Yi Tao appeared just like his old self without any obvious improvement.

Only Ye Zhuo was aware that more than half of the parasites in his body had already been eradicated.

“Has he been taking the medicine on time these days?” Ye Zhuo asked.

Chen Qiaoye nodded. “We did as instructed by you, Ms. Ye. He takes the medicine on time every day.”

“Great then.” Ye Zhuo turned over Yi Tao’s eyelids. “Next, he will need to be soaked in medicinal baths. I will write a prescription for you. Let him soak in the medicinal bath twice a day, once in the morning and once at night.”

“When will my husband recover to his healthy self?” Chen Qiaoye inquired.

Ye Zhuo answered, “He will be able to regain his consciousness after taking the medicinal bath for a month. By that time, he should be able to get off the bed to walk about.”

“Really?” Chen Qiaoye was elated.

Ye Zhuo nodded and then lowered her head to write down a prescription that she passed to Chen Qiaoye.

Meanwhile, the sound of rushed footsteps was heard coming from the door.

“Qiaoye! Qiaoye!”

The person was none other than Chen Qiaoye’s mother-in-law, Li Wenru.

“Mom.” Chen Qiaoye walked over to welcome her.

“Qingyue, you’re here.”

Li Qingyue, who accompanied Li Wenru, greeted her cousin-in-law.

Chen Qiaoye nodded in return.

Then, Li Wenru held Chen Qiaoye’s hand in excitement. “Qiaoye, is the miracle doctor here?”

Chen Qiaoye answered, “She’s here! She’s inside.”

“Take me to her, quick.”

“Alright, please follow me.”

Chen Qiaoye took Li Wenru and Li Qingyue to the bedroom.

At that moment, Ye Zhuo was examining Yi Tao’s pulse.

Then, Chen Qiaoye took the initiative to introduce, “Mom, this is Ms. Ye.”

“What?” Li Wenru was stunned for a moment.

Even though she was well aware that the miracle doctor was a woman, Li Wenru had never expected her to be so young.

Judging by her appearance. She looked to be about 17 or 18 years old at most.

Could a person like her really be a miracle doctor?

In fact, Li Wenru had even doubted if the young maiden was capable of differentiating between a flu and a fever… Was she here as a prank?

In Li Wenru’s heart, Chen Qiaoye had always been a steady, trustworthy person. She did not expect that Chen Qiaoye would actually do something so improper this time.

Chen Qiaoyue had disappointed her greatly.

Li Qingyue narrowed her eyes while the corner of her lips curled into a disdainful smirk.

She was under the assumption that Chen Qiaoye’s so-called miracle doctor was someone impressive.

It turned out that the person was the fake daughter of a wealthy family that every Yunjing resident knew about – Mu Zhuo. Oh, that was not right... She was known as Ye Zhuo now!

Who was there in Yunjing Province that did not know that Ye Zhuo was an illiterate deadbeat?

Nevertheless, at the thought of the jar that contained the Annox Parasite, a vigilant look emerged in Li Qingyue’s gaze once again.

A deadbeat would not have the capability to extract parasites out of a human body.

Moreover, Li Qingyue had seen Ye Zhuo in the past. Ye Zhuo always had thick makeup on in the past. Yet, the current Ye Zhuo did not have the slightest resemblance to her past self.

Li Qingyue clenched her fists tightly while a glint glimmered past her eyes.

“Mom, this is Ms. Ye.” Noticing that there was no reaction from Li Wenru, Chen Qiaoye repeated herself.

Li Wenru had only reacted to the situation after that. She nodded and cracked into a rigid smile. “Hello.”

She was still the matriarch of a wealthy family, after all. Even though she doubted Ye Zhuo’s capability, Li Wenru did not express it explicitly.

Ye Zhuo smiled. “Hi.”

Li Qingyue stood next to Li Wenru with a hand covering her mouth. The look in her eyes turned from astonishment to disbelief. “You, you’re… Mu Zhuo?”

If another person were in her place, the person would feel slightly awkward upon hearing the remark. After all, the name ‘Mu Zhuo’ had a bad reputation attached to it.

However, Ye Zhuo acted as if she could not understand the insinuation behind the remark. She raised her chin in a graceful yet dignified manner and said, “That’s me, but I’m Ye Zhuo now.”

Li Wenru turned her head to look toward Li Qingyue. “Qingyue, do you know her?”

Li Qingyue nodded.

After learning that Li Qingyue was acquainted with Ye Zhuo, Li Wenru was relieved, so she said, “Qingyue, please follow me outside. I’m sorry, Ms. Ye. I have something to say to my niece.”

“Please, go ahead.” Ye Zhuo nodded.

Li Qingyue smiled at Ye Zhuo in a friendly manner and then followed Li Wenru obediently.

Outside, Li Wenru immediately inquired about Ye Zhuo’s situation. There was a word known as ‘genius’ in this world. Li Qingyue herself was a rare talent too. Hence, the people that she was acquainted with were primarily people with outstanding talents as well.

As a result, Li Wenru wondered if this Ye Zhuo was especially gifted in medicinal practice.?Perhaps, Ye Zhuo could really cure her son. Li Wenru felt much more steady in her heart at the thought of this situation.

However, an awkward expression appeared on Li Qingyue’s face. “Uh… aunty, how should I tell you this…?”

“What do you mean?” Li Wenru furrowed her brows.

Li Qingyue replied, “Ms. Ye has been commissioned by my cousin-in-law, after all….” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Don’t mind her; just tell me the truth, Qingyue.”

“Uh…” Li Qingyue hesitated for a moment. “Alright then. That Ms. Ye in there was actually the daughter of the Mu family; she was known as Mu Zhuo….”

As soon as those words were spoken, Li Wenru’s face turned ghastly pale.

“So you’re saying that she’s the fake daughter of the Mu family who took what belonged to someone else?”

Li Qingyue nodded. “Don’t be angry, aunty. I believe that it’s possible that my cousin-in-law is unaware of Ms. Ye’s true identity….”

How could Li Wenru possibly not be furious?

A deadbeat whose bad reputation was known to all was here to treat her son? Was this not a joke?
