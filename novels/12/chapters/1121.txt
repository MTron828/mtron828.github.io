Translator: 549690339

Zhao Xueyin’s lips curled up. She found a seat and took out her phone to reply to Father Zhao’s message.

“What do you think this miss ye looks like?”

“She’s definitely not as good-looking as Miss Zhao!”

“Why isn’t she coming out yet?”

“”She’s coming, she’s Coming!” ”

“It can’t be! This is what Miss Ye looks like?”

“”This looks too ugly! It’s not quite what I imagined. Forget about competing with Miss Zhao, I’m afraid it can’t even compare to miss Zhao’s little fingernail.” ”

“Hearing this, the mocking look in Zhao Xueyin’s eyes became even more obvious. ”

“At this moment, another voice suddenly appeared in the air. ”

“”Wrong, wrong! That’s not Miss Ye! That’s the one!” ”

“Holy shit! This is too good-looking!”

“My God! What kind of Celestial Beauty Is This?”

“”Miss Ye has pierced through the starry sky and created the feeling of an entire Milky Way! My God, how can there be such a good-looking person in the world!” ”

Zhao Xueyin immediately looked up.

With this look.

Her expression immediately changed.

How could it be...

How could it be like this.

How could ye Zhuo control the starry sky so well?

“Moreover, she had clearly told Annie to get Xiao Li to make ye Zhuo look ugly on purpose! ”

Why was Ye Zhuo still so good-looking?

“”Miss Zhao and Miss ye are wearing the same style, right?”Someone below the stage recognized that the two were wearing the same style. ”

“”It’s not the same style, right? Miss Ye’s gown is clearly several grades higher than Miss Zhao’s!” ”

“”It’s the same style, it’s just that a certain someone can’t afford it.” ”

The people who were praising Zhao Xueyin just a second ago began to change their sides.

“She deliberately stepped on the time and even wore a starry night dress that’s exactly the same as Miss Ye’s. What do you think a certain someone is thinking?”

“”Of course it’s the thought of stealing the spotlight! Unfortunately, a certain someone overestimated himself and miscalculated.” ”

“...”

“Looking at Ye Zao on the stage, who was like the Moon surrounded by stars, and listening to the unbearable voices around her, Zhao Xueyin’s face alternated between green and white. She wished that she could find a hole in the ground to hide in. She was so uncomfortable that she could hardly breathe. ”

Ye Zao originally thought that this was just a very ordinary banquet. He would be able to eat dessert in peace after going through the formalities.

“Unexpectedly, after the self-introduction on the stage, elder Zhang pulled her to toast to the seniors. ”

“Looking at ye Zao walking in the crowd, Zhao Xueyin gritted her teeth. ”

Her face was full of unwillingness.

“When Si lui came in, he saw elder Zhang bringing ye Zao to toast to everyone. ”

“Seeing the evening gown on ye Zao, Si Lui’s eyes obviously flashed with surprise, but the next second, he frowned. ”

This gown...

Seemed a little familiar.

“Right at this moment, Si lui suddenly recalled that Zhao Xueyin was also wearing the exact same evening gown. ”

What did ye Zao Mean?

1

“Taking advantage of the fact that she was prettier than Zhao Xueyin, he deliberately wore the exact same evening gown to embarrass Zhao Xueyin? ”

“Even though Si lui was not a girl, he knew that it was not awkward to wear the same gown. Whoever was ugly would be embarrassed. ”

“When he thought of this, the lawyer’s eyes were filled with disgust. ”

He originally thought that ye Zao was just arrogant and conceited. He did not expect ye Zao to be so scheming!

“Other than that face, what else could she be compared to Zhao Xueyin? ”

The master was wandering while the clown was in the palace.

Such a person was really disgusting.

“At this moment, Zhao Xueyin suddenly saw the lawyer who was not far away. ”

“Looking at Si Lui’s gaze, was he attracted to ye Zao? ”

No.

No.

Si lui liked her.

He couldn’t let ye Zao succeed.

A scumbag like ye Zao was not worthy of Si Lui’s affection.

No!

Zhao Xueyin’s hands clenched into fists.

“In a moment, si lui retracted his gaze and looked for Zhao Xueyin’s figure in the crowd. ”

“Finally, he found Zhao Xueyin. Si lui immediately jogged over. “Xueyin.” ”

“Zhao Xueyin maintained her smile and said gently, “Big Brother Si, you’re here.” ”

“Si lui nodded. “Xueyin, are you alright?” ”

Zhao Xueyin was stunned. “What could have happened to me?”

“”Ye Zao, she...” ”

“Zhao Xueyin sighed, “I didn’t expect that I would choose the exact same gown as her. If I had known earlier, I would have worn that white gown!”! However, ye Zhuo looked much better in this dress than me! “Tell me, how can there be such a beautiful person in this world?” ”

Si lui frowned slightly. “Can’t you tell that she did it on Purpose?”

“On Purpose?”Zhao Xueyin was stunned. “You’re saying that ye Zhuo did it on purpose?” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Si lui nodded. “She did it on purpose! She knew that you chose this dress, so she chose the exact same dress as you.” ”

Hearing that.

Zhao Xueyin curved her lips without a trace.

So that was what Si lui thought.

Good.

This was really great.

“”She, she didn’t do it on purpose, right?”Zhao Xueyin glanced at ye Zhuo who was not far away. “Although we are competitors in the business world, she shouldn’t be like this.” ”

“Si lui sighed. “Xueyin, you’re too kind! You like to think of the good in everything! Ye Zhuo did it on purpose, deliberately making a fool of herself in front of everyone.” ”

“”No,”Zhao Xue Yin shook her head, “Brother Si, you must have made a mistake. Ye Zhuo doesn’t seem like that kind of person.” ”

Si lui was a little anxious when he saw Zhao Xue Yin like this.

Even he could see through this trick. Why couldn’t Zhao Xue Yin see through it?

“After saying that, Zhao Xue Yin continued, “Brother Si, don’t think too much. Although I also want to chase Ye Zhuo out of the consortium, that’s one thing. In private, I still hope to be friends with Ye Zhuo.” ”

“”Xueyin,”Si lui said somewhat helplessly, “With your character, you will suffer in the future!” ”

“Zhao xueyin smiled and said, “Am I that stupid in your eyes? Can’t even differentiate between good and bad?” ”

“At this moment, a commotion suddenly came from the crowd. ”

Zhao Xueyin turned her head to look.

She saw a tall figure walking towards the door.

“The person was about 1.85 meters tall and wore a handmade suit. Although it was a man, he had a small braid on his head. However, he did not look feminine. Instead, he looked exceptionally handsome, this made the socialites present exclaim in surprise. ”

“Oh my God! is that Li Ruo?”

It was really Li Ruo!

Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes.

Who Was Li Ruo?

“The Deputy Chief of DK Financial Group, who was ranked first on the international financial ranking. ”

Why was Li Ruo here at this time?

“Just as everyone was puzzled, duanmu ruo walked up to elder Zhang and cupped her hands. “Elder Zhang, I, Li, came uninvited. Please don’t mind me.” ”

Elder Zhang was also stunned. He remembered that he did not send an invitation to DK Consortium. Why was Li Ruo here at this time?

“”What are you talking about, Mr. Li? It’s simply an honor to have you here!” ”

“Li Ruo continued, “Congratulations, elder Zhang, for finally finding Miss Ye. Shunxi consortium can be considered to have a successor! Oh right, this is a gift that our fifth master prepared for Miss Ye. Please accept it with a smile, Miss Ye!” ”

Fifth Master had prepared a gift for ye Zhuo?

“When these words were said, everyone began to discuss animatedly. ”

Even Zhao Xueyin was somewhat puzzled.

Why would fifth master give a gift to Ye Zhuo?

Could it be because of her?

1

Zhao Xueyin’s thoughts sank into two months ago.

“Two months ago, at an international financial conference, she had performed very well. Although she had not seen fifth master in person, she was very sure that fifth master had noticed her. ”

“Because at that financial conference, she was the only Chinese woman who had entered the top five. ”

“So, it must be because of her! ”

“Master five did not know about the conflict between her and Ye Zhuo, so he had people send gifts to Ye Zhuo! To support ye Zhuo! ”
