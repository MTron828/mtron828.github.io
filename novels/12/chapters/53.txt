Chapter 54: Who’s The One Doing All The Carrying?

“What does ‘Silver’ mean?” Ye Zhuo asked.

Lin Shasha replied, “Silver is the one of the tiers in the game. There’s a total of 6 tiers, namely Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Ace, and High King in ascending order.”

This game sounded quite technical.

Ye Zhuo was not interested in the game at first, but after hearing what Lin Shasha said, her interest was piqued.

“Let me download the game first.”

Lin Shasha said, “Let’s go to my room! The signal in my room is better.”

“Okay.” Ye Zhuo nodded and followed behind Lin Shasha. And so, the two of them went to Lin Shasha’s room. Moments later, Ye Zhuo had finally downloaded the game.

Lin Shasha said, “Log in with WeChat and skip the beginner’s tutorial. I’ll carry you!” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

As a Silver-tier player, Lin Shasha was confident that she could carry Ye Zhuo!

“Zhuo Zhuo, I invited you. Please accept.”

“Okay.” Ye Zhuo agreed.

Although the game looked easy, Ye Zhuo was killed by a local hero as soon as she entered the game.

Lin Shasha comforted her, “It’s okay! Zhuo Zhuo, just follow me later. I’ll protect you!”

“Okay.” After resurrecting, Ye Zhuo followed Lin Shasha obediently.

Although Lin Shasha was a Silver, she had to struggle with carrying a newbie behind her. After playing three rounds, she lost all three rounds.

Her rank dropped from Silver to Bronze.

After losing three rounds in a row, Ye Zhuo seemed a little depressed and kept her head down without saying anything.

Lin Shasha was afraid that Ye Zhuo would be too sad, so she comforted her, “Zhuo Zhuo, it’s okay. It’s always like this for the first time! My first time was not as good as yours.”

Ye Zhuo raised her head slowly, revealing a pair of clear black and white eyes, “Okay! Let’s start another round. Sister Shasha, this round, I’ll carry you!”

Lin Shasha was stunned.

Although she knew that Ye Zhuo was very beautiful, she was still stunned by her beauty at this moment.

“You… You’re going to carry me?”Lin Shasha thought that Ye Zhuo was bragging, and she had every right to think so.

Honor of Kings tested one’s hand reflexes and brain power. It was rare for a girl to have both outstanding reflexes and brain power.

Moreover, Ye Zhuo was not even a Bronze, how could she carry her?

However, she didn’t want to hurt Ye Zhuo’s feelings, so she nodded. “Okay.”

The two of them clicked to enter the game.

Lin Shasha thought that Ye Zhuo would improve her strategy a little this time, but she didn’t expect her to still charge forward like before. “Zhuo Zhuo! Don’t rush forward! East Emperor’s Taiyi is super powerful in the early stages! You can’t beat him!”

As soon as she said this, a game notification sounded. “First, Blood! (First Blood!)”

F*ck!

Lin Shasha thought that her eyes were playing tricks on her. She asked in disbelief, “Zhou Zhuo, did you just kill East Emperor Taiyi?”

“Yes.” Ye Zhuo nodded.

Lin Shasha swallowed her saliva. Was this… Was this a coincidence?

Just as she was in a daze, the notification of Lin Shasha’s death popped up in the game.

“F*ck!” Lin Shasha was so angry that she swore, “This Lanling King launched a sneak attack!”

“Sister Shasha, don’t be angry, I’ll avenge you.”

Lin Shasha was about to tell Ye Zhuo not to act rashly, but Ye Zhuo had already instructed her hero to rush forward. Under the series of skillful control, she killed her opponent, just like that!

F*ck!

Lin Shasha turned to look at Ye Zhuo.

‘Big… Big Boss?’

Then, the sounds of ‘one kill’, ‘double kill’, ‘three kill’, ‘four kill’, and ‘five kill’ kept coming from the game.

For the first time in her life, Lin Shasha felt that even girls could be so handsome when playing games!

Who was the one doing all the carrying?

Lin Shasha felt a little embarrassed.

…

In the living room.

Ye Shu and Zhou Yuelian were chatting.

Zhou Yuelian was extremely happy for Ye Shu after hearing about the good business at the restaurant.

“Shu! After so many years of suffering, you’re finally enjoying a prosperous life, and there’s more to come!”

Ye Shu patted Zhou Yuelian’s hand. “Little Lian, you’re also very lucky! Both your children are so well-rounded. Shasha is sensible and obedient, and Weiwei got into a good university!”

Lin Weiwei was Zhou Yuelian’s son. He was Lin Shasha’s twin brother.

Zhou Yuelian smiled and said, “If Shasha could stay with me for two more years, I won’t have any regrets.”

Ye Shu was stunned. “Little Lian, what do you mean?”

Zhou Yuelian continued, “Don’t you know that Shasha has been dating Little Zhang for a few years now? Little Zhang is four years older than Shasha, so Little Zhang’s parents are a little anxious for them to get married. They hope that the two will have their wedding this year!”

The Little Zhang that Zhou Yuelian mentioned was Lin Shasha’s boyfriend, Zhang Qiang.

“So soon?” Ye Shu was very surprised.

Zhou Yuelian nodded, “I think it’s a little soon, too. After all, Shasha is only twenty years old.”. “But Little Zhang is already twenty-four years old. A boy’s youth can not be delayed. On top of that, the principal’s son is a really good boy. He’s honest and steady. He treats Shasha well, and he has a good family background. After discussing this matter with Old Lin, we decided to have it on October 1st.”

Zhang Qiang was an only child. Despite his parents being young, his family already had two houses in Yunjing.

Zhou Yuelian and Lin Jinshui were quite satisfied with him, and they didn’t want Lin Shasha to miss out on such a good match.

Ye Shu had also met Zhang Qiang before, and thought that the young man was quite good. “Then, what does Shasha think? I think we should respect Shasha’s opinion on this matter.”

Zhou Yuelian said, “My girl, Shasha, and Little Zhang are very close. She can’t wait to get the marriage certificate immediately.”

Ye Shu smiled and said, “Since Shasha loves the idea, and you guys are more satisfied with Little Zhang, it’s a good thing to get married early. Anyway, Little Zhang’s family is in the city. Even if she gets married, she can always come back to see you guys.”

…

In Shasha’s room, Ye Zhuo led Lin Shasha on a winning streak, and her rank had risen rapidly from Bronze to Ace!

She was only one step away from becoming a High King!

If it wasn’t for the lunch that was ready outside, she would have become a High King very soon.

This was the first time Lin Shasha enjoyed Honor of Kings so much.

“Zhuo Zhuo, how are you so good at this game? You’re even better than my boyfriend!”

Ye Zhuo touched her nose and said humbly, “I’m just so-so. Actually, this game doesn’t have much technical content.”

Lin Shasha continued, “Zhuo Zhuo, I think you can live stream the game. You can even earn money while playing the game.”

“What live stream?” Ye Zhuo’s eyes lit up when she heard about money.

Lin Shasha opened the live stream app and clicked on the most popular live stream room, “Zhuo Zhuo, look, this is the most popular game streamer, Dugu Xiu’er! He can earn at least a hundred thousand from a single live stream! It just so happens that there aren’t many female streamers in the live stream room right now. They are all just relying on their good looks! Zhuo Zhuo, you have good looks and skills. You will definitely become popular!”

Ye Zhuo’s expression remained the same. “In that case, I’ll go back and do some research.”

After returning home, Ye Zhuo registered a live broadcast account.

In the column of account name, she slowly typed “Hitara.YZ”.

After logging in, Ye Zhuo turned on the live broadcast. However, she did not intend to show her face. She only revealed her chin and below her collarbone.

She successfully turned on the live stream, but because it was a new account, there was no audience. However, Ye Zhuo was not discouraged. She had not turned on the live stream just to earn money. After playing a few rounds, she turned off the live stream and logged on to the international technology website to do some coding.

School was starting the next day, and the OS system was more than half completed. She had to solve all the problems that could be solved on the computer now, because when school started, she could only do it on her phone.

At that moment, there was a knock on the door. “Zhuo Zhuo! Mr. and Mrs. Yi are here. Come out quickly.”

‘Mr. and Mrs. Yi?’

Ye Zhuo’s eyes lit up.

‘Is it Chen Qiaoye and Yi Tao?

‘Has Yi Tao recovered from his illness?’

After a busy month, Ye Zhuo had almost forgotten about Yi Tao.
