He was seriously ill.

Han Dongliang had also figured it out.

One could not only think about himself in this world.

One had to think about the family around him.

“In fact, getting married and having children was also a happy thing. ”

Take this illness for example.

“If his parents were no longer in the world and he did not have any other relatives, who would take care of him? ”

“Getting married and having children, and having a happy family, was the final destination of life. ”

“Hearing this, Mrs. Han and Han Laoshan were stunned. They could not believe their ears. ”

“”Dongliang, what, what did you say?”Mrs. Han covered her mouth, her eyes full of disbelief. ”

“Han Dongliang repeated what he had just said, “Mom, you didn’t hear wrong. In the past, as a son, I was too selfish. In the future, I will listen to you well. Get married and have children as soon as possible, so that you and dad can live a happy life with a grandchild.” ”

Happy Life...

Mrs. Han’s eyes turned hot again. She almost thought she was hearing things.

She never dreamed that Han Dongliang would have such a big change after a serious illness.

“Han Lushan was also very excited. He stood at the side and wiped his tears. “Good boy, good boy! It’s good that you can think like that!” ”

The Zhao family.

“Soon, the assistant found out that Han Dongliang was awake. ”

“What?”Father Zhao looked up at the assistant with his eyes wide open. “Awake? That’s impossible!”

“Without an Gong’s bezoar pill, how did Han Dongliang wake up? ”

Could it really be because of Ye Zhuo?

“The assistant’s expression was a little complicated. “Master, he is indeed awake. I have confirmed it with Butler Han three times.” ”

Bang —

Father Zhao grabbed a teacup and smashed it on the ground.

The pieces scattered.

How did Han Dongliang wake up? !

Father Zhao never expected that a little girl like ye Zhuo could really cure Han Dongliang.

He had made ye Zhuo the chief seat.

How would the Zhao family advance to a noble family?

The study room was very quiet. The assistant did not even dare to make a sound.

“After a long while, Father Zhao finally reacted and asked, “Where is the eldest miss?” ”

“The eldest miss isn’t back yet.”

“Father Zhao pinched his temple. “Tell her to come back immediately!”At this time, what was Zhao Xueyin still doing in the financial group? ”

Was she embarrassing herself?

“I’ll inform the eldest miss right away.”The assistant walked out.

...

“In the blink of an eye, it was night time. ”

Ye Zhuo brought the medical kit to the Han family for a follow-up consultation.

The car had just stopped at the entrance of the Zhao family’s villa when he saw Han Laoshan and Mrs. Han standing there. “President Ye!”

“Godly Doctor Ye!”

The couple was especially excited when they saw ye Zhuo.

“”Elder Han, Mrs. Han,”ye Zhuo greeted politely. ”

“Mrs. Han held ye Zhuo’s hand and was so excited that she could not speak properly. “Godly Doctor Ye, thank you, thank you, thank you for saving my son. You Are the savior of our Han family. I, I will kneel down for you...” ”

Ye Zao immediately helped Mrs. Han Up. “Saving lives and helping the injured is the duty of a doctor. Please get up quickly.”

Mrs. Han stood up from the ground.

“Han Laoshan said, “I can’t thank you enough for your great kindness. President Ye, oh no, chief ye, if you have any use for our Han family in the future, our Han family will definitely go through fire and water without any hesitation!” ”

“Yes! Yes!”Mrs. Han nodded as well.

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Elder Han, Mrs. Han, you are too polite! Oh right, bring me to see Mr. Xiao Han Now!” ”

“This way.”

The couple brought ye Zhuo to Han Dongliang’s room.

“Compared to the morning, Han Dongliang looked much better at night. ”

He could even lie in bed and play with his phone now.

“”Dongliang, let me introduce you. This is Miracle Doctor Ye.” ”

Han Dongliang looked up.

He saw a young girl.

It was a cold winter and a cold month. She only wore a beige coat on the outside.

She was tall and slender.

“Her face was like a peach blossom, and she was devastatingly beautiful. ”

“Under the crystal lights, her jade-like face seemed to be coated with a layer of gauze. ”

“Although Yi Tao had told him that Miracle Doctor Ye was very young, Han Dongliang was still stunned when he saw ye Zhuo at such a young age. ”

“After a while, Han Dongliang finally reacted. “Miracle Doctor Ye.” ”

“Ye Zhuo nodded slightly, walked to the bedside and sat down. He then asked, “How are you feeling now, Mr. Xiao Han? Is there anything uncomfortable?” ”

“Han Dongliang shook his head. “There’s nothing uncomfortable, just a little dizziness.” ”

Ye Zhuo reached out and placed his hand on Han Dongliang’s pulse. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“A moment later, Ye Zhuo let go of Han Dongliang’s hand and continued, “Dizziness is a side effect of lying in bed. You can take a walk outside in moderation tomorrow during the day. But don’t take too long. Try to control it within half an hour.” ”
