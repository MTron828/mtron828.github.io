“[ Haha, From Now On, I’m a Martian. ] ”

“After half a year, ye Zhuo finally realized his plan to move everyone to Mars. ”

“Spring, summer, autumn, and winter came and went. ”

“In this half a year, the relationship between Lin Ze and Bai Jingshu had also improved. ”

Lin Ze had also successfully passed elder Bai’s test.

Bai Jingshu brought Lin ze back to Galaxy S to visit elder Bai.

“When he learned that Bai Jingshu had brought Lin ze back to visit him, elder Bai was naturally very happy, especially since Lin Ze had passed his test so beautifully without any preparation. Elder Bai admired Lin ze very much. ”

Elder Bai woke up early in the morning and waited for Bai Jingshu and Lin Ze.

“Not long after, he heard footsteps coming from the door. ”

“Then, he heard a servant’s voice. “Eldest miss is back.” ”

“”Mother Lin,”Bai Jingshu said with a smile. ”

Old Master Bai immediately went up to welcome her. “Jingshu is back!”

“Grandfather!”Bai Jingshu immediately ran over and gave old master Bai a big hug.

“Old Master Bai patted Bai Jingshu on the back and looked around. He asked in puzzlement, “Where’s Little Lin? Didn’t you say that you brought him back to see me together?” ”

“Bai Jingshu explained, “He’s at the hotel right now. He said he’d come to see you after adjusting his condition.” ”

“After staying in the interstellar shuttle for three days, he had to pay attention to the interstellar shuttle’s flight path. He was more or less in a bad state, and Lin Ze was a very ritualistic person. It was his first time meeting the female parent, of course, he had to be decent and leave the best impression on elder Bai. ”

“”This child is not an outsider. Why would he not stay in a hotel if he has a Family?”Old Master Bai looked at the butler, “Old Xiong, you go. You Go and fetch Xiao Lin from the hotel! Oh right, Jingshu, which hotel is Xiao Lin staying in? Why Don’t you go with Old Xiong? It just so happens that old Xiong doesn’t know Xiao Lin!” ”

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “Grandpa, why are you suddenly so nice to him?” ”

“”Look at what you’re saying. He’s my future grandson-in-law. If I’m not nice to him, who Am I nice to?”Elder Bai asked back. ” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Bai Jingshu continued, “Grandfather, you like him so much right now. What if he treats me badly that day or cheats on me?” ”

“”He won’t,”elder Bai said very firmly. “I know Xiao Lin. Xiao Lin isn’t that kind of person! Hurry up and go with Old Xiong. Don’t make Xiao Lin Wait.” ”

“”There’s really no need.”Bai Jingshu held onto elder Bai’s arm and continued, “Lin Ze is a very particular person. He said that he wants to see you in his best condition. Even if I go, he won’t come with me.” ”

“Their conversation was overheard by Bai Mo, who had just entered the room. ”

Bai Mo’s eyes were filled with ridicule.

“She had thought that elder Bai would object to this matter. After all, Lin Ze was from Earth, and elder Bai’s favorite granddaughter was Bai Jingshu. ”

“However, she had never expected that not only did elder Bai not object to the two of them being together, but he also accepted Lin ze so quickly. ”

Elder Bai was really smart and muddled for a moment.

Did he really think that Lin Ze would benefit from being ye Zao’s brother in name?

This was ridiculous!

“Ye Zao was ye Zao, and Lin Ze was Lin Ze. The two of them were independent individuals. ”

“Bai Mo hid the sarcasm in her eyes and walked forward. “Grandpa, SIS.” ”

Elder Bai looked up. “Miss Mo is back.”

“Bai Mo smiled and said, “I heard that SIS is bringing her future brother-in-law to visit today, so I came back to take a look. By the way, where’s my future brother-in-law?”Although Bai Moyin heard the conversation between Bai Jingshu and elder Bai.., she still pretended to look inside. ”

“Bai Jingshu explained, “Lin Ze is still at the hotel. He will come tomorrow.” ”

“”Oh, I see.”Bai Mo held Bai Jingshu’s hand and said with a smile, “Sister, I haven’t seen you for a long time. I’ve missed you!” ”

Bai Jingshu smiled and didn’t say anything.

“Bai Mo continued, “By the way, is my future brother-in-law going to stay here for a few more days? I’ll be the host then.” ”

“Lin Ze was ye Zhuo’s brother in name, so he was also ye Han’s brother in name. ”

“When the time came, the two of them would definitely make an appointment to meet. ”

Bai Mo lacked the opportunity to meet ye Han right now.

“It was not easy for Lin Ze to come to the s galaxy, so she would definitely not let go of this opportunity. ”

“”Mo Mo, we appreciate your kindness, but we shouldn’t be able to stay for long,”Bai Jingzhu tactfully rejected. ”

“Bai Mo smiled and said, “It just so happens that I’m not busy during this period of time. SIS, you don’t come back often. I’ll spend more time with you and Grandpa these few days.” ”
