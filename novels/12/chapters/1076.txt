“Chapter 1077: 237: a slap in the face, YC’s dad is awesome! 2”

Translator: 549690339

“[ the brother upstairs is right! Dad has never been a braggart. Since she has joined her stepmother’s base, she will definitely be able to complete the aircraft carrier project within two years. ] ”

-LSB- suppDad dad! ]

[ we all believe in Dad! ]

“[ Niu Hulu’s dog licks are too crazy! They actually believe in such unrealistic words, building an aircraft carrier within two years? Why didn’t she say that she would ascend to the Sky? ] ”

“[ let’s make a hypothesis! ]! If Niu Hulu could really build an aircraft carrier that could land on the eight planets, that would be a matter that would benefit all mankind! Not to mention other planets, just the diamonds on Neptune alone could allow us to realize the National Diamond Freedom Plan! ] ”

[ F * ck! Diamond Freedom! ]

“[ the previous poster also said that it was just a hypothesis! Diamond Freedom. If the aircraft carrier could really be developed so easily, why wait until now? ] ”

[ has Niu Hulu gone crazy? Aircraft carrier? Does she think that building an aircraft carrier is as easy as building a plane? Who does she think she is? She dares to boast about anything! ]

“[ I’m not a fan of Niu Hulu. I used to think that Niu Hulu was pretty good. At least she could win glory for the country in the science and Technology Competition! ]! [ but now, why does Niu Hulu look like she has been bewitched by someone? ]? [ developing an aircraft carrier? ]? [ and she even made such a big deal out of it! ]! [ isn’t she afraid that she will be blacklisted by the Chinese science and Technology Industry? ] ”

“[ don’t forget, Niu Hulu is not only a big shot in the science and technology industry, she is also a star in the entertainment industry. She probably thinks that the science and technology industry is a food industry! isn’t it just bragging to make it hot? Anyway, bragging is not illegal! ] ”

“[ no matter what others say, we, the brothers of the Niu Hulu family, have always supported Dad! ] ”

[ right! We have always supported Dad! ]

[ waiting for dad to slap his face! ] Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

[ dog licking is so disgusting! ]

“[ watch carefully, dog licking, it’s not certain who will slap whose face! ] ”

“[ hahaha! Building an aircraft carrier within two years, this is definitely the biggest joke I’ve seen in 20120! ] ”

[ this is the international network! It’s so embarrassing that it’s thrown overseas! ]

“[ even if we succeed, we will fail! China’s technological path has come to an end. Niu Hulu hasn’t even achieved anything yet, and she’s already so arrogant! ] ”

[ she’s indeed arrogant! Could it be that the experts from over 200 countries are inferior to her? Who does she think she is? ]

“[ Niu Hulu’s contribution to the technological world is undeniable, but she can’t do it Like This! With her arrogance, does she still have anyone in her eyes? Building an aircraft carrier? I think she’s using the intelligence of the experts from all over the world to rub against the floor! ] ”

“[ niu Hulu seems to have forgotten the saying that the stronger the better! ]! Although she won first place in last year’s science and technology competition, there were many experts who were stronger than her. It was just that they disdained to show up! Unlike Niu Hulu, who actually said that she could build an aircraft carrier! Did she think that her family owned an aircraft carrier company? What a joke ”

“[ everyone, let’s not talk too much. Niu Hulu’s sons are not to be trifled with. They are afraid of getting into trouble! ] ”

[ sit and wait for tomorrow’s press conference! ]

[ sit and wait together! ]

Tang Xue sat in front of the computer and looked at the comments on the forum. The corners of her mouth curled up slightly.

The reactions of the people on the international internet were more extreme than she had imagined.

It was not even two years yet!

“Once it was two years, Ye Zhuo would really lose face abroad! ”

“Moreover, the base was going to hold a press conference tomorrow. ”

“Now that half of the researchers in ye Zhuo’s research group were gone, she wanted to see how ye Zhuo would explain it to everyone. ”

“Thinking that ye Zhuo would make a fool of himself in front of the cameras tomorrow, Tang Xue felt extremely happy, and the curve of her lips became more obvious. ”

On the other side.

At the construction warehouse in Area C.

“Actually, Zhou Gong was the same as old nie from before. He had doubts about ye Zao. After all, Ye Zao was too young, but he believed in the four brothers, Jianghe Huhai. ”

“Since Jianghe Huhai had no doubt in Ye Zao, then ye Zao definitely had a reason to convince them. ”

“Looking at ye Zao who was speaking with assurance and assurance, Zhou Gong could not help but say, “Miss Ye, talking on paper is still talking on paper. Can you please give us a demonstration?” ”

Ye Zao smiled slightly. “Of course.”

“As she spoke, she walked to a worker’s side and bowed slightly. “Let me use the computer for a while.” ”

“Okay.”The worker in blue uniform stood up and offered his seat to Ye Zao.

“Ye Zao sat in front of the computer and pressed two buttons casually. The computer screen switched to the 3D design page. He clicked on it and enlarged it. Then, he began to modify the loopholes. After modifying the design, Ye Zao looked up at Cen Jiang, “Bring me a precision welding machine.” ”
