A normal friend?

“As soon as he said this, even Lin Ze felt that something was wrong. ”

Why did he have to explain to Ye Zhuo that he was just a normal friend?

Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly. “Oh? Just a normal friend?”

“Since he had already said it, he naturally couldn’t take it back. Lin Ze nodded and said seriously, “Yes, just a normal friend.” ” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Ye Zao did not point it out. He smiled and said, “Then I wish you and your ordinary friend a good time. We’ll be leaving first.” ”

“Okay.”Lin Ze nodded.

Ye Zao held Cen Shaoqing’s hand and walked to the other side.

“CEN Shaoqing said, “I feel that Ah Ze is a little strange today.” ”

“He is indeed a little strange.”Ye Zao’s eyes were filled with a smile. “He even said something like an ordinary friend.”

Wasn’t this a place without any silver?

“Aren’t they just ordinary friends?”Cen Shaoqing looked back at Lin Ze.

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “If you were watching a movie with your friends, would you emphasize ‘ordinary friends’in private?” ”

Cen Shaoqing instantly reacted. “Could it be that Ah Ze has found a girlfriend?”

“Take a guess.”Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly.

“Do you want to take a Guess?”Cen Shaoqing had already learned the essence of Ye Zhuo.

Ye Zhuo rolled his eyes at him and walked forward. “I can’t be bothered with you.”

Cen Shaoqing immediately jogged to catch up with Ye Zhuo and held her hand. “What are we going to eat later?”

Ye Zhuo thought for a moment. “Let’s Go Eat Hotpot?”

She had not eaten hotpot for a long time.

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. He had always been picky when it came to food.

In the broadcasting hall.

“Lin Ze walked in with his back hunched and said in a low voice, “I didn’t know your taste, so I bought you a cup of pearl milk tea.” ”

“Thank you.”Bai Jingshu reached out and took the cup of milk tea. “I like drinking pearl milk tea very much.”

“Actually, Bai Jingshu rarely drank milk tea. ”

She always felt that adding milk to the tea would ruin the original fragrance of the tea.

“However, Lin Ze was the one who bought the milk tea, so she naturally wouldn’t reject it. ”

“On a hot day, Lin Ze followed the principle that girls couldn’t have ice with them, so he ordered a cup of hot milk tea for Bai Jingshu. ”

“Bai Jingshu arched her eyebrows slightly, and for some reason, she felt that Lin Ze was a little cute. ”

“When the warm milk tea entered her mouth, although it was a little warm, her heart warmed up as well. ”

“At this moment, Bai Jingshu could hear her own heartbeat very clearly. ”

She felt that she had probably met the most important person in her life.

“Watching a horror movie while thinking of spring and snow in her heart, Bai Jingshu felt that she was probably the most important person in history. ”

“After drinking more than half a cup of milk tea, Bai Jingshu turned her head slightly and looked at Lin Ze. She lowered her voice and said, “Lin Ze?” ”

“Lin Ze was not focused on the movie at the moment, as there were many young couples around him. Hence, he reacted the moment Bai Jingshu called out to him. “Yes.” ”

“Bai Jingshu asked, “Do you have a girlfriend?” ”

“No.”Lin Ze shook his head.

“”Then...”Bai Jingshu chose her words carefully and continued, “What about the person you like?” ”

“Maybe.”Lin Ze hesitated for a moment. “I think... I already have one.”

He felt that he should like Bai Jingshu.

From that night onwards.

It was a very wonderful experience.

He could feel his heart racing at any moment.

It was as if his heart had been struck by an elk and it was beating wildly.

“Although he had never liked anyone before, he knew very clearly that this was the feeling of liking someone. ”

Was there someone he liked?

Bai Jingshu’s gaze darkened for a moment.

Perhaps she had made the wrong decision by taking the initiative to have dinner with Lin Ze and watch a movie today?

Did she look like a clown in particular?

“The more Bai Jingshu thought about it, the more confused she became. Her heart was also in a mess, and she regretted her actions today even more. ”

She recalled the words that her grandmother had told her when she was young.

“Run away to be a concubine, and get engaged to be a wife. ”

A girl should be more reserved. She shouldn’t be so proactive.

“The more Bai Jingshu thought about it, the more uncomfortable she felt. ”

“But then, she thought of another sentence. ”

Relationships needed to go both ways. One person couldn’t be the only one who could give.

“If Lin Ze was the same person as her and wasn’t good at expressing his feelings, then they would never be able to move forward. ”

Bai Jingshu was a little nervous now. She didn’t know what Lin Ze would think of her.

“Bai Jingshu tried her best to calm herself down. Since she had already asked the question, she might as well ask all the questions at once. “Then... do I know her?” ”

“Know what?”Lin Ze asked.

“Bai Jingshu said, “Do I know the person you like?” ”
