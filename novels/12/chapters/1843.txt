“Outside the dream, Tian Zhifang’s tears wet the pillow towel. ”

“Every time she woke up, Tian Zhifang was terrified and couldn’t wait for Yu Zifei to withdraw from the OASIS project. ”

“As long as Yu Zifei didn’t withdraw from the Oasis Project, Tian Zhifang wouldn’t have peace. ”

“”Mom,”Yu Zifei also felt a little uncomfortable. “I understand your feelings. I can promise you that there will never be such an accident next time.” ”

“”Can you promise that?”Tian Zhifang looked at Yu Zifei, “Zifei, I’m already over 50 years old this year. If anything happens to you, do you think your father and I can still survive? If you don’t think about yourself, you have to think about your father and me.” ”

“Yu Zifei sighed and continued, “Mom, you should know that leaving Earth and going into outer space has always been my dream. I hope that you and dad can support me and understand me.” ”

“Yu Zifei had a dream of going into space since he was young. He had always been glad that when he grew up, he could still hold on to his childhood dream. ”

“Yu Zifei was very grateful to ye Zhuo for being able to participate in the aircraft carrier project, land on Mars, and become the project leader of the OASIS project. ”

“If it weren’t for Ye Zhuo, he wouldn’t have been able to walk so smoothly! ”

“Although he had encountered danger on Mars, he had never blamed anyone. All of this was just a necessary path in life. ”

No one’s path in life was smooth sailing.

“At this moment, Tian Zhifang asked him to withdraw from the oasis project. How could this be possible! ! ”

Yu Zifei was also very unwilling.

“Hearing this, Tian Zhifang stood up and said with an excited expression, “Dream? is dream more important than your life, more important than your father and I?” ”

“”Mom, you’re thinking too extreme.”Yu Zifei looked at Tian Zhifang and said, “Not every mission will encounter danger. This is just an accident. You Can’t deny it just because of this accident...” ”

“”Stop talking,”Tian Zhifang interrupted Yu Zifei’s unfinished sentence. “Yu Zifei, listen carefully. If you don’t withdraw from the Oasis Project, don’t Call Me Your Mother Anymore!” ” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“As a mother, she couldn’t watch her son step into the abyss. ”

She had to stop Yu Zifei!

“Mother!”Yu Zifei did not expect his mother to suddenly make things difficult for him. He also did not expect his mother to force him to withdraw from the oasis project.

“”Call Miss ye right now and clarify the matter. If you don’t want to say it, I can speak for you,”Tian Zhifang said. ”

Yu Zifei frowned slightly. “Do you have to do this?”

“”Yes!”Tian Zhifang said, “As your mother, I have to be responsible for you! I Can’t Watch You Die!” ”

“In Tian Zhifang’s opinion, this was no different from dying. ”

“Most importantly, that place was still Mars. ”

“If Yu Zifei had any problems with that place, he wouldn’t even be able to preserve a complete corpse. ”

“”Mom, that’s not suicide!”Yu Zifei continued, “According to what you said, could it be that the people participating in the OASIS project are all going to die?” ”

“”I don’t care about other people’s affairs. But you’re my son, so I have to care about your affairs!”Tian Zhifang made up her mind and continued, “Call Miss ye right now!” ”

“Yu Zifei had already had an accident on Mars. Ye Zhuo was reasonable, so she definitely wouldn’t make things difficult for Yu Zifei. ”

“”Mom, don’t force me. I really don’t want to leave the Oasis Project.”Yu Zifei looked sorrowful. ”

“On one side was her mother, and on the other side was the job she loved. Yu Zifei had no choice at all, and it was difficult for her to choose. ”

“Do you not want me as your mother?”Tian Zhifang looked at Yu Zifei and asked.

“Yu Zifei took a deep breath and didn’t say anything, ”

bang.

“Just then, the door was pushed open from outside. ”

Yu Zifei looked up and saw father Yu walking in from outside.

“When he saw Father Yu, Yu Zifei’s expression became even worse. He said, “Dad.” ”

“Father Yu nodded and asked, “What happened?” ”

What happened?

It was obvious that Father Yu would definitely stand by Tian Zhifang’s side.

Father Yu would definitely force him to leave the oasis project together with Tian Zhifang.

“Even a mother like Yu Zifei would find it difficult to deal with, let alone a father! ”

What should they do now?

Yu Zifei didn’t know what to say.

“When Tian Zhifang saw father Yu come in, she felt even more confident. “His father, it’s good that you’re here. Ask him if he’ll choose his life-threatening dream or us!” ”
