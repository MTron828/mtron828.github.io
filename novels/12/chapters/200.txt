“Chapter 201: 089: Lin Jincheng’s secret, brother Ze who dug up the trap, domineering online! 7”

Translator: 549690339

Lin Jincheng hurriedly opened the safe and took out the diary with trembling hands.

The thick notebook was full of those past events.

Lin Jincheng flipped through the pages one by one.

“Secretary Zhang saw this and quietly left the office. In the huge office, Lin Jincheng was alone in an instant. ”

Ye Shu was his first love.

That year.

Ye Shu was eighteen.

He was nineteen.

“Lin Jincheng never thought that when ye Shu was with him, she was with another man at the same time. ”

Why?

Why did she treat him like this?

No.

She wouldn’t.

Ye Shu was so kind. Why would she treat him like this?

This must be a misunderstanding.

It was a misunderstanding!

Ye Shu was a good girl.

She wouldn’t do this.

She couldn’t do such a thing.

“When Lin Jincheng faced the phantom limb pain, he didn’t shed a single tear. But now, he couldn’t hold it in anymore, and his tears began to burst. ”

He wanted to find ye Shu and ask her about it.

But he was afraid to face reality.

“Right now, he was dragging a broken body, and he didn’t have enough courage to face these things. ”

The air was oppressive and cramped.

...

At the CEN residence.

“Today, Cen Shaoqing was also at home. ”

“At the dining table, old Mrs. Cen suddenly said, “Xiang Xiang.” ”

“”What’s wrong, Mom?”Zhou Xiang looked up at Old Mrs. Cen. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Didn’t we arrange for Yezi to go hiking with us tomorrow? Remember to call Ze Yan. Ze Yan is a very good child.” ”

“”The three of us are going hiking. Why Do We Need Ze Yan?”Zhou Xiang asked, puzzled. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “Don’t you think that Yezi and Ze Yan are a good match?” ”

“Zhou Xiang was even more puzzled. She turned to look at CEN Shaoqing and said, “Haven’t you been trying to match up burning and Shaoqing?” ”

This old lady was really full of ideas.

“”That Brat doesn’t like Yezi, so I can only fix up Yezi and Zeyan.”Cen sighed and pretended to be regretful. ”

Zhou Xiang nodded and picked up the phone to call Zhou Zeyan.

“Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly. After Zhou Xiang finished the call, he put down his chopsticks and said gently, “Grandma, Mom, I’ll go with you tomorrow.” ”

Zhou Xiang looked at Cen Shaoqing strangely.

Could it be that the sun had risen from the west today?

Cen Shaoqing was actually going to climb the mountain with them!

“Normally, Cen Shaoqing would rather sit at home and chant scriptures than accompany them for a walk. ”

It had been a long time!

“Old Mrs. Cen said with a look of disgust, “Why are you following us when we’re going to climb the mountain? It’s fine as long as Zeyan is here. Are you going to be a third wheel?” ”

“After saying that, old MRS. CEN said again, “If you want to go, you can go with us! But you have to remember one thing, Don’t Disturb Yezi and Ze Yan’s relationship!” ”

Cen Shaoqing’s expression did not change. He picked up a tissue and wiped his face. “I’m full. I’ll go back to my room first.”

“Seeing Cen Shaoqing’s back disappear outside the door, old Mrs. Cen was so happy that she laughed out loud. ”

She was really too smart!

She had subdued this little rascal with one move.

“Zhou xiang frowned and said, “Mom, what are you up to?” ” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Old Mrs. Cen waved at Zhou Xiang. “Come here, I’ll tell you.” ”

Zhou Xiang curiously leaned her head over.

Old Mrs. Cen told Zhou Xiang her plan in full detail.

“When she heard this, Zhou Xiang was overjoyed. “Mom, you’re really too good! Why didn’t I think of this move of yours?” ”

She wondered what was wrong with Cen Shaoqing.

So he was jealous.

“Old Mrs. Cen raised her head proudly. “That’s right. Otherwise, how could I be your mother! Remember to act according to the plan tomorrow!” ”

Zhou Xiang nodded in agreement.

The next day soon arrived.

The few of them agreed to meet at the foot of the mountain.

Ye Zhuo arrived at the appointed place on time.

“Old Mrs. Cen, Zhou Xiang, and Cen Shaoqing had all arrived. ”

“In the crowd, Cen Shaoqing, who was dressed in a plain robe, was particularly eye-catching. He was holding a string of Buddhist beads in his hand. ”

It was as if he would ascend to immortality at any moment.

“”Grandma Cen, Aunt Xiang.”Ye Zhuo jogged over. “Mr. Cen.” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “What Mr. ? Everyone is so familiar with each other! Shaoqing is twelve years older than you. You can just call him Big Brother.” ”

“In Korean dramas, weren’t all brothers brothers? ”

It was definitely right to call him brother.

“”I’m the fifth brother at home,”Cen Shaoqing answered calmly. ”

Ye Zhuo understood the hidden meaning of this sentence. “Fifth brother Cen.”

“Old Mrs. Cen looked at the road leading down the mountain and frowned. “Why isn’t Zeyan Here Yet? Xiangxiang, call him and ask.” ”

It was a coincidence.

Zhou Xiang had just taken out her phone when it rang.

It was a call from Zhou Ze Yan.

“On the phone, Zhou Ze Yan said that he couldn’t come because of something. ”

“Last night, after Zhou Ze Yan received a call from Zhou Xiang, he was so excited that he didn’t sleep for the whole night. When he set off this morning, he even specially sprayed perfume on his body. ”

He was extremely flirtatious.

“Unexpectedly, on the way here, the counselor suddenly called him and asked him to go to school. ”

It was the kind of question that he had to go to.

“Helpless, Zhou Zeyan could only turn around and go to school. He was extremely depressed. ”

“After hanging up the phone, Zhou Xiang said, “Zeyan can’t come because he has something to do. Let’s go first.” ”

“Old Madam Cen’s gaze secretly glanced at Cen Shaoqing. “What a pity! Why did he say that he won’t come? ! Since Zeyan can’t come because he has something to do, then let’s Go First!” ”

She wouldn’t believe that Zhou Zeyan’s sudden visit had nothing to do with Cen Shaoqing.

What a good boy.

He hid himself well.

The four of them walked into the mountains.

“It was April in the human world, and the scenery in the mountains was very beautiful. ”

“There was greenery everywhere, which made people feel better. ”

“Halfway up the mountain, Old Mrs. Cen couldn’t walk anymore. She turned to look at ye Zao and said, “Yezi, let’s Rest for a while! I’m too tired.” ”

“”Yeah, I happen to be tired as well.”Ye Zhuo nodded. ”

Ye Zhuo did not try to be pretentious. He directly sat on the ground and leaned against a pine tree.

“At this moment, old Mrs. Cen suddenly gave Zhou Xiang a look. ”

Zhou Xiang immediately understood and stood up to stretch his arms. “The air on this mountain is really good. The birds sing and the flowers are fragrant.”

“Old Mrs. Cen also stood up. “Yes! If we have time, we should come out more often.” ”

“At this moment, Zhou Xiang suddenly said with a horrified expression, “Snake! There’s a snake!” ”

“”Shaoqing, kill it!”Old Mrs. Cen was also terrified. ”

Cen Shaoqing looked up and saw ye Zao leaning against a tree trunk. There was a snake coiled with its tongue.

“Just as Cen Shaoqing was about to make a move, Ye Zao was one step ahead of him. He directly pinched the snake’s seven inches and held it in his hand. There was not even a ripple on his handsome face. He was extremely calm. ”

“He smiled at Old Mrs. Cen and Zhou Xiang. “Grandma Cen, Aunt Xiang, don’t be afraid. It’s just a cauliflower snake. It’s not poisonous.” ”

Old Mrs. Cen:”...”

Zhou Xiang:”...”

They had arranged for the snake in advance because all girls were afraid of snakes.

“Thinking about it, ye Zao must be afraid of snakes as well. ”

They had wanted Cen Shaoqing to be a hero and save the damsel in distress.

But they were saved by ye Zao instead.

There seemed to be something wrong with the plot.
