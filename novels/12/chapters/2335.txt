“Elder Bai sighed. “Jingshu has a tough life and hasn’t met any good parents. As her grandfather, I naturally can’t mistreat her anymore.” ” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Under normal circumstances, elder Bai wouldn’t easily say this to anyone, but Lin Ze was different. It could be seen that Lin Ze was a good child. ”

Lin Ze was worthy of his honesty.

“At the same time, elder Bai hoped that Lin Ze would not let him down. ”

“”Grandfather, don’t worry. I Can’t guarantee anything else, but I can promise you that I will never bully Jingshu.”Lin Ze looked at elder Bai with a serious expression. ”

“Elder Bai nodded and smiled. “Xiao Lin, I will remember your words today. I hope that you will remember them forever.” ”

“”Grandpa, I will definitely remember them forever.” ”

“Okay.”Old Master Bai nodded in satisfaction.

“At this moment, footsteps came from outside the door. ”

“Who’s Here?”Old Master Bai looked up at the door.

“”Grandpa, it’s me.”Bai Mo’s voice came from outside the door. ”

“Old Master Bai smiled and said, “So it’s the little girl Mo. .” ”

“Bai Yuanyuan continued, “Grandpa, you saw Mo. . Why didn’t you see me?” ”

“The Lass Yuan is here too!”Old Master Bai stood up from his chair. “It’s better to come at the right time than early. We have a guest at home today.”

“Bai Mo smiled and said, “It’s future brother-in-law, right?” ”

Lin Ze nodded politely. “Hello.”

“Bai Yuanyuan continued, “Hello, future brother-in-law. I’m Bai Yuanyuan, Sister Jingshu’s third cousin. We’ll be a family from now on.” ”

“Bai Yuanyuan’s words were very affectionate, but there was a hint of mockery in her eyes. ”

Bai Jingshu was also willing to go all out. She actually brought her back to the old residence.

Wasn’t she ashamed of herself? !

“If it wasn’t for the fact that she was here to see Bai Jingshu make a fool of herself, she wouldn’t have wanted to come over, much less call an earthling brother-in-law. ”

“”Hello, I’m Lin Ze,”Lin Ze continued. ”

“At this moment, Bai Mo suddenly noticed ye Han sitting beside her and asked in surprise, “Ye Han, you’re here too?” ”

“”Bai Mo,”ye Han said with a smile. ”

Bai Mo?

“Upon hearing this, Bai Mo’s gaze dimmed for a moment. ”

“One had to know that before this, Ye Han had always addressed her as Mo Mo. . ”

“It had only been a short while, but she and Ye Han had already become so unfamiliar with each other. ”

“Bai Mo’s expression quickly returned to normal. She smiled and said, “This person in a relationship is indeed different from us. Ye Xiaohan, are we already so unfamiliar with each other now?” ”

“Hearing this, Ye Han touched his nose. “I’m sorry, the family members are more strict.” ”

“Ever since he got together with Shi Qingcheng, Ye Han had voluntarily kept his distance from the girls. ”

“After all, he and Shi Qingcheng were in a long-distance relationship. ”

“Long-distance relationships were not easy to begin with, so he could not let Shi Qingcheng feel threatened. ”

Family member?

Who was the family member?

Shi Qingcheng?

“Realizing this problem, Bai Mo was so jealous that she almost died. Her heart was filled with mixed feelings, and she felt very uncomfortable. ”

She Knew Ye Han before Shi Qingcheng did.

But she still let Shi Qingcheng Snatch Lin ze away.

On what basis did Shi Qingcheng have?

“At the same time, Bai Mo was very regretful. She regretted that she did not develop a relationship with ye Han back then. ”

“”By the way, why isn’t your girlfriend here today?”Bai Mo continued to ask. ”

“Ye Han replied, “She should be here soon.” ”

“”OH.”Bai Mo nodded and said with a smile, “I’ve long heard that Miss Shi looks like there’s no such thing as heaven and earth. Today, I can finally see her in person!” ”

“”An ordinary person,”ye Han said modestly. ”

“Bai Mo continued, “Oh right, I sent you a message earlier to invite you out for coffee. Why didn’t you reply to me?” ”

“Did you send me a message?”Ye Han asked in surprise.

Bai Mo nodded. “You didn’t see it?”

“”No,”ye Han continued, “Sometimes, my account is posted by Qingcheng. Maybe she received the message and forgot to tell me.” ”

“Bai Mo wanted to spit out a mouthful of blood, but she had no choice but to hold it in. ”

She did not know that Ye Han and Shi Qingcheng’s relationship had already reached this stage.

It did not matter.

It did not matter.

Her favorite thing was a challenge.

She did not believe that she would lose to Shi Qingcheng.

“Bai Mo smiled and said, “I did not expect Miss Shi to be so controlling.” ”

“Any man would not like a woman who was too controlling, let alone a successful man like Ye Han. ”

“Elder Bai furrowed his brows and interrupted the conversation. He smiled and said, “Let’s not sit in the front hall anymore. Let’s go to the back garden for a walk.” ”
