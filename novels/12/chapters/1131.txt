A very sincere thank you.

“You’re welcome.”Ye Zao’s expression was indifferent.

“He looked extremely calm, as if nothing had happened just now. ”

At this moment.

Ye Zao’s phone rang from outside.

“Hello.”Ye Zao picked up the phone.

“He didn’t know what was said on the other end, but ye zao continued, “Well... We’re now on the eighth floor.” ”

The eighth floor?

Nothing could be seen in the elevator.

How did ye Zao figure out that it was the eighth floor?

Could it be that she had x-ray vision?

“After hanging up the phone, someone asked, “Miss Ye, are you sure this is the eighth floor?” ”

“”It’s the eighth floor,”ye Zao said. ”

“How are you sure this is the eighth floor?”

“I feel it.”Ye Zao pressed the brim of his hat.

Feeling?

Everyone thought that ye Zhuo had some secret move!

So it was just a feeling!

“Hearing this, everyone was shocked. ”

“What if your feeling is wrong?”

“A woman in pink said, “I still feel that this is the ninth floor! Do you think that the eighth floor is the eighth floor? If you make a mistake, who will bear the consequences?” ”

“”That’s right, that’s right! A person’s life is at stake, how can you use feeling to mess around!” ”

“Faced with everyone’s doubts, Ye Zhuo did not say anything else. His calm face seemed to be covered in a layer of snow. ”

“At this moment, the sound of knocking on the door came from outside. “Miss Ye! We’re from the rescue team. Miss Ye, are you inside?” ”

“Hearing this, everyone looked at each other in dismay. They could see the shock in each other’s eyes. ”

It was the eighth floor.

It was really the eighth floor!

Ye Zao’s feeling was not wrong!

The woman in the Windbreaker narrowed her eyes unwillingly.

Ye Zao would be in the limelight!

“Here.”Ye Zao raised his eyes slightly.

“Hearing ye Zao’s voice, the rescue team heaved a sigh of relief. “Miss Ye, no one is injured inside, right?” ”

“No.”Ye Zao’s Red Lips parted slightly.

“”It’s good that you don’t recognize that you’re injured.”The rescue team outside continued, “Miss Ye, don’t be anxious. We’ll pry open the door immediately.” ”

“Hurry up.”Ye Zao’s eyes were still as sharp as ever. “The speed limiter and safety pliers can only hold on for five minutes.”

“Once the speed limiter and safety pliers were completely ineffective, the elevator would fall rapidly. ”

From the eighth floor to the second underground floor.

A total of ten floors high!

One floor was 2.8 meters tall. Ten floors was 28 meters!

“Falling from 28 meters high, even if they did not die, they would be crushed into pieces! ”

“When they heard this, everyone was scared out of their wits. ”

“”Miss Ye, don’t worry. The speed limiter and safety forceps will not fail! We have already activated the emergency brake!” ”

“”Only five minutes, hurry up!” ”

Ye Zao’s voice suddenly turned cold.

“The rescue team leader was so scared that his face turned pale. He hurriedly said to the rescue workers beside him, “Hurry Up!” ”

“Roger.”

Creak —

“At this moment, the elevator door was finally forced open a crack. ”

The crack was not big.

It could only accommodate one person.

“Because there was a problem with the landing location, there were still a few steps between the elevator and the ground. ”

“When they saw the rescue workers, everyone heaved a sigh of relief. Their faces were filled with the ecstasy of having escaped death. ”

“The rescue team captain smiled and said, “Everyone, hold on a little longer. We will be able to open all the elevator doors soon.” ”

“Okay.”

“Ye Zao looked up at the top of the elevator. A soft sound traveled through the air. Ye Zao’s ears twitched slightly. “There’s no time! Everyone, quickly get out! Let the old man walk in front!” ”

“Hearing this, everyone tried their best to squeeze forward. There was no time to care about the old man. ”

An old man with gray hair was pushed to the back.

“”I said let the old man walk first. Didn’t you hear me?”Ye Zao grabbed the man’s arm and forcefully pulled him back. “Old Man, quickly go.” ”

“The old man was moved. He did not even have time to thank him. He was old, and his movements were not as agile as the young man’s. The Old Man climbed up several times but still could not get out. ”

“At this moment, Si lui supported the old man’s body and lifted her up. ”

Someone on the ground immediately caught the old man.

“”Young man, you and that little girl should come up as well!” ”

Si lui took the opportunity to jump up.

He stretched out his hand pretty well and easily jumped up.

There were still ten seconds left. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Ye Zhuo narrowed his eyes.

There were two people in front of her.

“If nothing unexpected happened, there should be no problem. ”

“This is great! We are finally out! I almost thought I would die in the elevator!”

“The Girl in Pink folded her arms across her chest and glanced at the elevator with a mocking look in her eyes, “Didn’t miss ye just say that there wasn’t enough time? Why is the elevator still fine even though we’ve been out for half a day? I think she’s just grandstanding!” ”
