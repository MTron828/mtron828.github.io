Translator: 549690339

“Jin Yuyan thought that she could get rid of the problem once and for all and take the opportunity to get rid of Ye Zao and Bai Xiaosu, ”

she didn’t expect that she would shoot herself in the foot.

“Ye Zao was fine. On the contrary, the people that she sent over ended up with their cars destroyed and people killed. The three people in the car were directly killed by the explosion! ”

Jin Yuyan frowned tightly. “Investigate! Investigate for me! This matter must have something to do with ye Zao!”

The people that Jin Yuyan sent over were all elites among elites.

“If it was not for ye Zao’s tricks, they definitely would not have ended up with their cars destroyed and people killed! ”

“”Okay.”The other side continued, “Princess, don’t worry. We will definitely investigate this matter thoroughly!” ”

“Even after she hung up the phone, Jin Yuyan’s face was still filled with anger. ”

“She had never suffered such a loss before, nor had she ever made a loss in business. This was the first time. ”

It was obvious that she had still underestimated ye Zhuo.

On the other side.

The 30th floor of the hotel.

“A tall figure stood in front of the window, overlooking the scenery below. The Man’s face was expressionless. In a flash, he peeled a big white rabbit milk candy into his mouth. ”

“Instantly, a sweet and greasy taste spread in his mouth. ”

“A normal person would subconsciously frown when they ate such a sweet thing, ”

“at this moment, there was a knock on the door. ”

“Come in.”

The assistant walked in from the door. “Boss.”

“What’s the matter?”

“The assistant looked at the man’s back and continued, “The hospital called. They said that Miss Zhou is missing!” ”

Miss Zhou.

“Of course, she was referring to Zhou Chenyu. ”

“Ever since Zhou Chenyu’s surname was changed to Zhou, his mental state had become abnormal. In order to prevent her from hurting others, Song Shiyu sent her to the mental hospital. ”

“During this period of time, Zhou Chenyu had been recuperating in the mental hospital. ”

Song Shiyu narrowed his eyes. “Look for her.”

“Yes.”

“Is there anything else?”Song Shiyu continued to ask.

“”No,”the assistant replied. ”

“Then you can go down first.”Song Shiyu waved his hand.

The assistant bent down and turned to walk out of the door.

Chen Siyan was also on a business trip in C Nation.

“Every time she came to C Nation, she would choose to stay at the song family’s hotel. ”

“When she walked to the hotel entrance, she suddenly saw a familiar figure. ”

“It was song Shiyu’s assistant, Liu Kai. ”

Song Shiyu also came to C Nation?

“Chen Siyan’s originally dim eyes suddenly lit up. Before she could say anything, her secretary, Xia Wei, said, “Isn’t that Mr. Song’s assistant, Liu Kai?” ”

“I think so.”Chen Siyan nodded.

“Xia Wei had been following Chen Siyan for more than three years, so she could clearly read Chen Siyan’s mind. She smiled and said, “I’ll go and say hello to Liu Kai.” ”

“Okay.”

“Xia Wei jogged over to Liu Kai’s side. “Liu Kai, why are you here in C Nation Too?” ”

“When he saw Xia Wei, Liu Kai was a little surprised. “You’re here too?” ”

Xia Wei nodded. “I’m here on a business trip with Miss Chen.”

Only then did liu Kai see Chen Siyan standing not too far away.

“So Miss Chen is here too.”

“That’s right. Why else would I be here alone! What about you? Are you here on a business trip with Mr. Song Too?”Xia Wei continued to ask.

Liu Kai nodded. “Yes.”

“Xia Wei continued, “By the way, when did you and Mr. Song arrive in C Nation?” ”

“Liu Kai answered, “We arrived on the afternoon of the 28th. What About You?” ”

“”We arrived on the afternoon of the 27th.”Speaking up to this point, Xia Wei suddenly realized that song Shiyu seemed to have followed Chen Siyan closely. ”

Chen Siyan had just arrived when song Shiyu arrived right after her.

What a coincidence!

“Realizing this problem, Xia Wei’s eyes rolled around. ”

Could it be that song Shiyu had followed Chen Siyan here?

Yes.

It had to be.

“Otherwise, how could it be a coincidence. ”

“She didn’t expect song Shiyu to say that he didn’t like Chen Siyan on the surface and had no feelings for her, but he cared so much about Chen Siyan on the mainland. ”

“If song Shiyu didn’t like Chen Siyan, why would he secretly follow Chen Siyan. ”

He didn’t expect song Shiyu to be such a boring old man.

“”Then you guys arrived a day earlier than us.”Liu Kai continued, “I have something to do, so I’ll go over first.” ” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“”Okay.”Xia Wei continued, “By the way, is Mr. Song staying here as well?” ”

“”Yes.”Liu Kai nodded. “This hotel belongs to our boss. If he is not staying here, where is he staying?” ”

“OH.”Xia Wei had a plan in her mind. “Then you can go back to your work!”

“”Yes, send my regards to Miss Chen.” ”

“Okay.”Xia Wei nodded.

“After Liu Kai left, Xia Wei jogged to Chen Siyan’s side. ”

“Miss Chen!”
