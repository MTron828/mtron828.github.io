Chapter 176: 086: Prison for murder! A big shot in the business world! 4

So it was because the neighbors downstairs heard something wrong and called the police.

“Bang!”

The luggage in an Dongliang’s hand fell to the ground, and a pair of cold handcuffs handcuffed him.

Xia Xiaoman was not very surprised when she heard that an Dongliang was in prison for murder.

Because from the beginning, she knew that an Dongliang would not end up well.

An Lizi went to see an dongliang.

No matter what, an Dongliang was still his father. Now, an Dongliang’s life was on the line.

Logically speaking, she should come and see him.

Through a glass window.

An Lizi saw an Dongliang’s Haggard face. In just a few days, an Dongliang seemed to have changed.

“Dad.”

“Lizi.”An Dongliang tried his best to smile at an Lizi. “Thank you for coming to visit dad.”

When the prison guard said that his family members had come to visit him, an Dongliang thought that he had made a mistake.

......

He did not expect an Lizi to really come.

“Are you alright in There?”An Lizi asked.

The people who lived with an dongliang were all death row prisoners. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

These people were capable of doing anything.

An ordinary person would not be able to imagine what kind of torture this was.

If he could do it all over again, an Dongliang would never betray Xia Xiaoman. He would take good care of his wife and daughter.

Unfortunately.

He could not go back.

An Dongliang nodded and said in a relaxed tone, “I’m fine, don’t worry. Lizi, you and your mother should focus on your studies and get into a good university. Don’t let your mother worry.”

“Your mother is a good woman. I’m obsessed with her. I’ve let her down and I’ve let you down. I’m not a good husband and I’m not a good father.”

”...”

“Lizi, if you get married in the future, you have to keep your eyes open. Don’t ever meet someone like me! Listen to your mother. She’s your mother and she’s older than you. She’s more experienced in society and she has a better eye for people than you... ... ..

“Lizi, you must be good to your mother!”

When a person was dying, his words were kind. Unknowingly, an Lizi’s face was already covered in tears.

Once upon a time, she also had a happy family and a father who loved her...

Ten minutes of visiting time quickly passed.

Walking out of the prison gate, an Lizi looked up at the sun above her head and tried her best to hold back her tears.

All the dark clouds had passed. In the days to come, she would prepare for the college entrance exam wholeheartedly and try to get into the same university as ye Zao.

...

These days, Ye Shu had been studying English. Even when he was eating, he did not forget to read an English dictionary.

When Ye Sen returned home from a business trip, he was stunned!

The person in front of him who was speaking with ye Zao in English, was it really ye Shu?

After learning English for a while, Ye Sen was not a layman. He could tell that ye Shu’s pronunciation was very standard!

“Sister, you must be cheating! It’s only been a few days? You speak English so well? !”

Ye Shu smiled and looked up. “Do you think everyone is you? How can you learn English well?”

In fact, in the first few days, Ye Sen was still very serious.

After a few days, he could no longer persist.

Ye Sen was only interested in what he was interested in.

English was too boring.

After being exposed by Ye Shu, Ye Sen scratched his head in embarrassment. “Who said that? I’m also very hard-working, okay?”

Ye Zao calmly continued, “Uncle, teacher Tom, who is in charge of teaching you, sent me a message yesterday. He told me that you haven’t gone to his live broadcast room for three days.”

Ye Sen:”...”holy shit! Heartless! So Cruel!

After saying that, ye Zao continued, “Uncle, you can’t do this. Learning English won’t do you any harm! Soon, my mother will be several streets ahead of you, and you are still standing there!”

Ye Sen nodded and said with a determined look, “From today on, I will study English well!”

“This is for you.”Ye Zao Handed Ye Sen a book.

“What is this?”Ye Sen looked puzzled.

Ye Zao continued, “This is the method of learning English that I recorded. A good memory is not as good as a bad pen. If you have time, you can memorize it. My mother will check it in a week.”

Ye Shu nodded in cooperation.

Sometimes, Ye Sen was like a child. Someone had to supervise him.

Otherwise, he would never be able to learn English well.

And the person ye Sen was most afraid of was ye Shu.

Ye Sen held the notebook and smiled. “Isn’t it just memorizing something? It’s a piece of cake!”
