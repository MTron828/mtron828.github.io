“Chapter 399: 117: Cen Shaoqing is CEN fifth master, so remorseful that even his intestines have turned green! 2”

Translator: 549690339

All that was left for Mu Yourong was the dust on the ground.

“Ah!”

Mu Yourong cried out in despair!

...

In the car.

“Old Madam Cen looked at Cen Shaoqing with some worry. “Damned Brat, I’m telling you! You must not be deceived by that scum, Mu Yourong! I only recognize Yezi as my granddaughter-in-law!””

“Nowadays, some SCUM’s methods were very high.”

Old Mrs. Cen was worried that Cen Shaoqing would be deceived by Mu Yourong.

“In fact, the main reason was that old Mrs. Cen had recently read a romance novel.”

“In the novel, the male lead was deceived miserably by the scum!”

“Under the Scummy Woman’s frame, the male lead had many misunderstandings about the female lead. He dug out her heart and dug out her kidney!”

He tortured the female lead badly!

The most infuriating thing was that the female lead actually forgave the male lead in the end.

She was like a sand sculpture.

Old Lady Cen’s teeth were itching as she watched. She wished she could put on a book and punch the female lead to wake up! Then she kicked the male lead’s head to the side!

“After all, Mu Yourong was just a little white lotus.”

She would lie as soon as she opened her mouth.

“In order to marry into the Cen family, she could even slander her biological parents.”

So Old Lady Cen was worried!

“What if Cen Shaoqing was like Li Qiandong, blind and deceived by Mu Yourong?”

Old Lady Cen would never allow such a thing to happen!

“With this in mind, Old Lady Cen looked fiercely at Cen Shaoqing, “If you dare to have any misunderstandings towards Yezi and bully her, I Will Smash Your Dog Head! I will break your dog legs! From now on, you will no longer be my eldest grandson! We will no longer be friends! I will never forgive you for this!””

“Cen Shaoqing:”...”Heh, biological grandson?”

“Did you hear that?”Old Mrs. Cen slapped Cen Shaoqing hard.

Cen Shaoqing twirled the prayer beads. “I heard it.”

Old Mrs. Cen was stunned. Her eyes were filled with surprise.

What did she just hear?

Holy Sh * t!

She was overjoyed!

Cen Shaoqing actually did not emphasize that he did not want to get married!

This meant that Cen Shaoqing had really fallen in love with Ye Zao.

Old Madam Cen was overjoyed.

Of course.

Such joy could not be expressed. Old Madam Cen could only cover her mouth and Snicker.

What if she laughed her granddaughter-in-law to death?

“At this moment, the old lady cen seemed to have suddenly thought of something and turned to look at Cen Shaoqing, she then said, “Oh right! What happened to that kid from the Li Family? Did he eat SH * t? Do you know what he said in front of me today?””

Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly. “What happened to him?”

The old lady immediately told Cen Shaoqing about Li Qiandong’s visit to find trouble.

“When Cen Shaoqing heard that Li Qiandong was actually chewing on ye Zao’s tongue in front of old Mrs. Cen, a shadow flashed across his eyes.”

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “You must seek justice for Yezi on this matter! Our Yezi is so good, why should we let that bastard slander us!””

Cen Shaoqing held the Buddha bead in his hand. “I know what to do about this matter.”

Old Madam Cen nodded. “As long as you know what you’re doing.”

“After spending so much time at the police station, it was already past ten in the afternoon, so old Madam Cen did not go to the ye residence.”

At the same time.

Mu Yourong arrived at the Mu family villa in a daze.

“When she saw the court seal on the villa, she realized that this was no longer her home.”

“Not only had she lost her engagement, but she had also lost her identity as the eldest daughter of the Mu family.”

She was supposed to be a phoenix that roamed the nine heavens!

Ye Zao!

It was all ye Zao!

“If it was not for ye Zao, she would not have become like this!”

She hated ye Zao!

“Very soon, Mu Yourong arrived at the place she was renting.”

The environment here was very poor.

It was no different from the basement that ye Shu used to live in.

Mu Yourong took a deep breath and pushed open the door to enter.

Shen Rong sat on the sofa and played with her phone. She did not even realize that Mu Yourong had returned. Words like ‘one pie’and ‘East Wind’kept coming from the air.

Mu Yourong closed her eyes. A fire suddenly rose in her heart.

Playing Cards! Playing Cards! All you know how to do is play cards!

It was already half past six and she had not cooked yet. Did Shen Rong really think that she was still a rich lady?

“If it wasn’t for Shen Rong, she wouldn’t have broken off the engagement with the Cen family!” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

It was all her fault!

“The More Mu Yourong thought about it, the angrier she got. She threw her phone on the coffee table.”

“Only then did Shen Rong react. She raised her head to look at Mu Yourong. “Yourong is back! Hurry up and cook, I’m starving to death! That gas is different from ours, I don’t know how to Burn It!””

“Shen Rong had been a rich lady for over twenty years, and had lived in luxury for twenty years. She was not used to suddenly moving to the slums.”
