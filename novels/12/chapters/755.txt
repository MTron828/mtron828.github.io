“After finishing the last skewer, Zhao Pingting held ye Zao’s hand and said, “Zao Lizi, look, there’s a five Yuan shop over there. Let’s go in and take a look.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded.

“After coming to this world for so long, this was the first time she saw a five yuan shop. She was very curious about what kind of jewelry five Yuan could buy. ”

The three of them came to the five Yuan shop together.

They thought that the two yuan shop wouldn’t have any beautiful jewelry.

They didn’t expect to see a dazzling array of beautiful jewelry!

“DAMN! This crystal hair clip is so beautiful!”An Lizi picked up a small crystal hair clip.

“Zhao pingting came over and said, “It’s really beautiful! I think this is suitable for burning!” ” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“”I think so too!”An Lizi looked at Ye Zha. “Zha Zha, come here for a moment.” ”

“What’s Wrong?”Ye Zha put down the thing in his hand and walked over.

“An lizi smiled and said, “Zha Zha, don’t move. I want to see if this hair clip is suitable for you.” ”

Ye Zha did not move.

An Lizi stood on her tiptoes and placed the hair clip next to Ye Zha’s ear.

“Ye Zao’s hair was disheveled today. The white crystal hair clip and the white shirt she was wearing complemented each other. In addition, she was already born white. Under the dazzling crystal, she felt even whiter to the point of being transparent. ”

“It had always been accessories that complemented people, but to ye Zao, they actually became accessories that complemented people. ”

“However, the hair clip that cost five yuan, when worn on ye Zao’s head, was even more dazzling than those thousands of accessories! ”

“DAMN! It’s so beautiful!”An Lizi couldn’t help but exclaim.

Zhao Pingting immediately brought a mirror to ye Zao.

“Ye Zao looked at himself in the mirror and whistled, “Tsk! You’re so naturally beautiful! Why Do I Look So Beautiful?” ”

“It was obviously a narcissistic sentence, but she said it as if it was natural. ”

It was as if she was supposed to be so dazzling!

“When the shop owner suddenly heard this sentence, his heart was filled with disdain. ”

“Young people nowadays were really becoming more and more narcissistic, not knowing how to be reserved at all. ”

He looked up.

The shop owner was also stunned.

Holy shit!

This was indeed a natural beauty!

“After opening the shop for so long, the shop owner had seen the most young and beautiful girls, but this was the first time the shop owner had seen someone like Ye Zhuo. ”

This was simply too beautiful!

“By the time the three of them walked out of the jewelry shop, it was already twenty minutes later. ”

“While they were choosing accessories, the man had been sitting at the lamb soup stall next door drinking the lamb soup. ”

“After drinking the lamb soup, the man once again followed their footsteps. ”

Although they were very far apart.

He could still see that there was an additional hair clip on her head.

Under the Sun.

The crystal hair clip was emitting a brilliant light.

It was especially eye-catching.

“Boss.”

A young man suddenly appeared behind the man.

“What’s Wrong?”The man turned his head slightly.

“It’s time to take the medicine.”The young man handed the man a bottle of stabilizer.

“Perhaps it was because of his childhood experience, he had a severe mania and emotional disorder. He was a typical zero degree empathy negative P-type personality. ”

“He had to take medicine almost every day, or else he would not be able to control his emotions. ”

“The Man took the bottle, poured out three pills from it, and swallowed them. ”

The assistant behind him immediately handed him an open bottle of mineral water.

The man directly raised his hand and refused.

The assistant withdrew his hand.

“The man continued, “You go back to the hotel first.” ”

“Okay.”The assistant nodded.

After the assistant left.

Ye Zao’s figure could no longer be seen in the food street.

The man walked a few steps in the direction where ye Zao disappeared.

At this moment.

The man seemed to have stepped on something. He moved his foot away and looked down.

It was a crystal hairpin that had been stepped on in half.

“The man bent down and picked up the hairpin. He took out a plain white handkerchief from his pocket and wrapped the hairpin layer by layer. Finally, he put it into his pocket. ”

“Thinking that ye Zhuo had already gone back, the man did not stay in the food street any longer. He turned around and walked to the other side. ”

“Ye Zhuo, an Lizi, and Zhao Pingting had eaten their fill in the food street and were now walking in the direction of the hotel. ”

“Along the way, Ye Zhuo had been paying attention to the situation behind her. ”

But the strange thing was.

“Along the way, she did not find any suspicious people. ”

Could it be...

Something was wrong with her senses?

Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly.

The three of them returned to the hotel.

“An Lizi looked up at ye Zao and asked curiously, “Zao Zao, Where’s your hair clip? It looks so good. Why did you take it off?” ”
