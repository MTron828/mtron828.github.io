“In the end, out of the five hundred plus members of the Feng clan, there were less than a hundred left. ”

“At this moment, the new leader took over. In order to save face, the new leader sent two doctors over to go through the motions so as not to attract any attention. ”

“The two doctors were rookies. They did not know about the situation of the Feng clan before this, nor did they know that the virus was not only contagious, it had reached a point where it could not be salvaged. After one of the doctors learned about the situation of the Feng family, before he could even finish his sentence, he was so frightened that he flew away in the aircraft. ”

The other doctor was forgotten on the asteroid.

“During the two days that he was forgotten, the doctor and the doctors of the Feng family treated everyone together. ”

“Two days later, the Doctor Who ran away turned around and came back to pick her up. Just when everyone thought that she would leave with the aircraft, she made a decision that shocked everyone. ”

“She decided to stay and face it together with everyone. At the risk of being infected, she searched for the source and nemesis of the virus, carefully treated everyone, and brought all kinds of supplies to everyone. For a time, she became the only hope and oasis in this pair of bones and yellow sand. ”

“During that time, the most she said was that everything would be fine. ”

Let’s go home together.

They encouraged each other and encouraged each other. Their days seemed to be getting better by the day.

“Unfortunately, the good times didn’t last long. ”

“Just when everyone’s condition was getting better, this doctor was suddenly infected by the virus. For a moment, everyone was anxious. ”

“However, although she was infected with the virus, she was not defeated by the virus. She continued to treat everyone every day. ”

“Finally, the heavens did not disappoint those who were willing. With the efforts of the doctors, she developed a special medicine three months later and successfully conquered the virus. After that, the Feng family stood up again! ”

“Hearing this, Leo continued to ask, “The one who stayed behind to treat the virus was Miss Ye?” ”

“Mr. Feng nodded. “Yes, it was Miss Ye.” ”

“After saying that, Mr. Feng sighed and continued, “I only found out later that Miss Ye’s virus infection was not an accident. She did it on purpose.” ”

“At the same time, this was also what Mr. Feng admired most about ye Zao. ”

“Under such circumstances, it was already impossible for an ordinary person to keep ye Zao, but she still did something that an ordinary person did not even dare to think of. ”

“If it was not ye Zao who came back then, there would not have been anything after that. ”

“”Why?”Shi Qingcheng continued to ask, “Why did Zao deliberately infect the virus?” ”

“Mr. Feng said, “If you want to destroy the enemy, you have to understand the enemy and get to the bottom of it.” ”

“Shi Qingcheng said in disbelief, “So searing flame is using himself as an experiment?” ”

“”En.”Mr. Feng nodded. Although five years had passed, he still could not forget it. “If it wasn’t for Miss Ye’s risk-taking, our Feng clan would not be where we are today.” ”

“Hence, the Feng clan had a rule from then on. ”

“No matter who it was, old or young, sick or disabled, they had to treat ye Zhuo with the highest etiquette. ”

Kneeling on one knee was the highest etiquette of the Feng clan.

“Leo could not help but exclaim, “My father is too good! No wonder Mr. Feng respects her so much!”In order to save people, he actually used himself as an experiment. There were not many people in this world who could do it. ”

Shi Qingcheng frowned. “This is too dangerous.”

“Even Shi Qingcheng, who had received professional training, would think carefully before doing something like this. ”

Do As you can.

“”It is indeed very dangerous,”Mr. Feng continued, “Miss Ye is even prepared to die. “I asked Miss ye why she did this, and she said so. She said that her life was picked up from the ground. She knows how precious life is and can not watch so many people’s lives disappear. She has to do her best. As for the rest, it’s up to fate.” ”

Only by working hard would she not regret it. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Ye Han continued, “My sister’s personality has always been like this. She’s very stubborn about certain things.” ”

“However, although ye Zao valued life, she did not save everyone. ”

She had her own bottom line.

“Leo said, “It reminds me of the first time I met Father Zao. At that time, she was only 18 years old. I thought, what kind of skills could an 18-year-old girl have? She didn’t put her in my eyes at all. Good guy, she almost died in that fight!” ”

Leo was subdued by Ye Zao.

“At the same time, Ye Zao was also his idol. ”
