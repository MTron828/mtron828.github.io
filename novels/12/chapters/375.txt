“A very magnetic voice. A very pleasant voice. Because he deliberately lowered his voice, it still carried a faint huskiness. ”

It went straight to the depths of my heart.

It made me suffocate.

“His hand gently clasped her waist. The temperature of his palm was a little hot. Through a thin layer of expectation, I could still feel the thin cocoon between his fingers. ”

It was slightly itchy.

“At this moment, ye Zao could clearly hear his own heartbeat. ”

“Thank you.”Ye Zao raised his hand and gently hugged him.

The corners of Cen Shaoqing’s mouth curled up into a faint arc.

This smile.

“It was as if spring had returned to the Earth, and everything had been revived. ”

“When the people on the forum saw this scene, they all turned into seers: ”

“[ if these two aren’t busy, I’ll eat SH * t Live! ] ”

[ Dad has another dog outside... ]

“[ ditto, I also feel that there’s something wrong with these two. They must have been secretly dating for a long time. ] ”

[ F * ck! is dad going to find us a stepmother? ]

“[ dad, NO! We don’t need a stepmother! ] ”

“[ with a stepmother, we’ll have a stepfather. Dad doesn’t love us anymore! ] ”

“[ although I don’t really like stepmothers, I still feel that these two people are inexplicably compatible. ] ”

“Yes! They’re so compatible!”

“Who is this guest presenter? Why didn’t the host introduce him in detail?”

“”It’s indeed quite strange! However, to be able to attend the science and Technology Conference and be a guest presenter, this means that our stepmother is definitely not an ordinary person.” ”

“Mu Yourong sat below the stage and looked at the two people hugging each other on the stage. She gritted her teeth in hatred, and the jealousy in her eyes was about to spill out. ”

“If it wasn’t for Ye Zhuo, the person hugging Cen Wu Ye would be her. ”

Slut!

“Ye Zhuo, this slut. ”

“”System! System, where have you been?” ”

Mu Yourong was both jealous and afraid.

She was afraid that the system would leave her.

Would the system never come back?

It wouldn’t.

She was the system’s host.

The system would definitely come back!

Definitely!

The award ceremony ended very quickly.

Ye Zhuo walked off the stage.

“Dr. Warne, Chu Zimo, Zheng Yuanjie, and the rest of the science and technology industry all stood up to welcome her. ”

This was the first time that China had won the first place at a science and Technology Conference.

It was ye Zhuo who broke the record.

“Sitting on the other side, the three magnates of country P were so angry that their faces turned black. ”

None of them had thought that they would lose to a little girl who looked like she was only in her teens!

Shameful!

“This time, it was truly too shameful. ”

Especially Carol.

“Last year, he had taken first place. ”

“This year, he had not even taken fourth place. ”

“If it had not been for ye Zao, he would definitely have taken third place. ”

Mu Yourong sat next to Ye Zao.

She saw a group of people walking over to congratulate ye Zao.

“But here, no one cared. ”

Mu Yourong felt extremely uncomfortable.

“If it wasn’t for ye Zao’s sudden appearance today, she would definitely be the one being congratulated. ”

Ye Zao was clearly the fake daughter who had taken over the magpie’s nest. What right did ye Zao have to possess all of this?

Mu Yourong prayed for the system to return quickly.

Only when the system returned would she be able to defeat ye Zao! DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“At that time, she would definitely make ye Zao suffer a fate worse than death. ”

“After the science and Technology Conference ended, Ye Zao was invited by the experts of the science and technology industry to participate in the latest season of the science and Technology Exhibition. ”

“Ye Zao was surrounded by the crowd, as if she was surrounded by stars. ”

“Although she was the youngest, she did not have stage fright at all. ”

“Standing among the experts, not only did she not lose to them, she even appeared to be particularly imposing! ”

“Daddy is so cool!”

“Where’s the stepmother?”

“”@painted XR, come out quickly! Didn’t you say that Daddy is a team?” ”

“The brothers upstairs don’t scold her anymore. I just checked her account and realized that her account has been harmonized by some brothers.”

“The live broadcast is about to end. I Can’t bear to part with my father and stepmother!”

Ye Zao went to attend the science and Technology Exhibition and held a meeting with the experts.

She stood in front of the conference table and spoke with confidence and generosity.

“The experts, who were only half a hundred years old, were seriously taking notes like a group of primary school students in class. ”

“However, all of this did not feel out of place. ”

“When Ye Zao returned to the hotel, it was already past ten o’clock in the evening. ”

Ye Zao went into the bathroom and took a shower.

“Just after he took a shower, he received a wechat message from CEN Shaoqing: [ do you want to have supper together? ] ”

Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly and teased: [ a monk also eats supper? ]

“[ a monk is also a human. Moreover, I’m not a monk. ] ”

Ye Zao continued to reply: [ Where Are You Now? ]

Cen Shaoqing: [ I’m staying right next door to you. ]
