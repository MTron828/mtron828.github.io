Ye Zao released the mouse and looked up slightly. “Thank you. But the most important thing now is to find out who the two people who tried to kill Carl are.”

“”As long as there are surveillance cameras, everything will be easy!”The deputy executive said excitedly. “I want to tell Miss Smith the good news immediately! Miss Smith will be very happy!” ”

“Looking at the back view of the deputy executive and ye Zao, they left. ”

“Adar and Polly, who were standing on the side, were stunned. ”

“They stood on the spot, unable to say a word. ”

How could this be?

Ye Zao had actually restored the surveillance cameras!

This was the surveillance camera that Hacker l had personally hacked.

“Other than L himself, there was no one else who could restore the surveillance cameras. ”

“Adar, who had always looked down on the Chinese, only felt that his body was covered in cold sweat. ”

It was not a good feeling to put his face on the ground and step on someone who was looked down on.

He could not figure it out.

He really could not figure it out.

Polly sat in front of the computer for two hours and could not figure out anything.

How long had ye Zhuo been sitting in front of the computer?

It had not even been ten minutes.

“”It’s not her! The person who restored the surveillance was not her at all!”Yardar looked at Ye Zhuo’s back, then he said, “How could a Chinese person master the most advanced computer system! Polly, you restored the surveillance! She just took advantage of you!” ”

Ye Zao had just used Polly’s computer.

Polly had been working hard in front of the computer for more than two hours.

This was the result of Polly’s two hours of hard work! 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Polly was stunned at first, then he quickly reacted, “Mr. Yardar, you’re right! I restored the surveillance, but before the progress bar appeared, it was snatched away by this Chinese person!” ”

“Thinking that he had actually restored the surveillance footage that Hacker l had personally hacked, Polly was very excited. ”

“”Yes! That must be the case!”Yardar nodded. “Sinister, it’s really too sinister!” ”

“Yardar had long heard that the Chinese were more sinister, but he did not expect that the Chinese were actually so sinister. ”

They actually wanted to snatch other credits.

“The winner was obviously Boris, but ye Zao took it away. ”

And it was the kind of person who did not blush and did not have a heartbeat.

Shameless.

“This time, Adar’s understanding of the Chinese was completely new. ”

He had never known that people could be so shameless.

They could flaunt the fruits of other people’s labor.

“Adar looked at Boris and said, “Don’t worry, Boris. I will definitely get justice for you.” ”

On the other side.

Ranito casino.

“No matter how Adar asked, Carl never gave him An’s contact information. ”

“Meanwhile, the Selead branch began to openly look for Carl, which made Adar very worried. ”

Adar scratched his hair and looked up at Hibbert. “Carl is still not willing to say anything?”

“”Yes.”Hibbert nodded. “Minister, do we need to torture him?” ”

Ranidou was not a clean place.

Yaler was the king of the encirclement. There were countless torture devices that could make people talk.

“”Not for the time being,”yaler continued, “Have the surveillance cameras been cleaned up?” ”

Carl and An were both rare talents.

Yaler wanted to take them for his own use and not offend them.

“Hibbert nodded. “Don’t worry. It was L. who did it personally. Also, Selead has our people. If there is any movement, we will inform them immediately.” ”

“”That’s good.”Hearing that L personally handled the surveillance, alar let out a sigh of relief. ”

L was the number one hacker in the world. No one could recover the surveillance that he personally hacked.

In the lounge.

L took off his coat and was about to rest for a while when the computer lit up.

L Ben rubbed his eyes and looked tired.

“But in the next second, the fatigue on his face disappeared. ”

Someone broke through his firewall and restored the surveillance.

“At this moment, L thought he was hallucinating. ”

How could this be?

Who Was it!

“L may not be in the underworld, but hacking was his specialty. In all these years, he had never met an opponent! ”

“SELEAD headquarters sent two top computer experts to study him for more than two hours, but they couldn’t do anything to him, let alone others! ”

Who was this person?

“L immediately sat up straight, operated the computer, and quickly locked onto the other party’s IP! ”

“Soon, L found the person who hacked his firewall and restored the surveillance. ”

This person was actually one of the computer experts sent by SELEAD headquarters.

Strange.
