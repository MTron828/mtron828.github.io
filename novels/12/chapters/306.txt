Translator: 549690339

The Sun was scorching hot.

The ripe coconuts on the coconut tree were particularly tempting.

“”Look, there are coconuts!”Zhou Xiang was a mainlander and rarely had the chance to see the sea. Now that she saw the wild coconut tree, she was particularly excited. ”

“”Let me see if I can climb up,”ye Zao said as he rolled up his sleeves, revealing a part of his wrist that was as white as snow. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen raised her head to look at the coconut tree and held ye Zao’s hand. “No! This tree is too tall. We can’t risk our lives for a few coconuts. What if we break our legs? Shaoqing, you go!” ”

“Cen Shaoqing:”...”Heh, aren’t you afraid that he will break his legs? His own grandmother? ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Actually, we don’t have to climb the tree.” ”

“After saying that, she picked up a few stones from the ground and looked up at the coconut tree. She aimed at the position and used a little strength to throw it over. ”

Pa Pa pa —

“The stones accurately hit the coconuts on the tree, and all of them fell down. ”

Old Madam Cen and Zhou Xiang were stunned.

“The leaves are awesome!”

“”Zha Zhuo, you’re really amazing!” ”

“Ye Zhuo said humbly, “Just so-so, third place in the world.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing turned his eyes slightly, and was caught off guard. He crashed into that smiling face that was like a flower. ”

Bang —

His heart seemed to have been hit by a heavy object. It beat uncontrollably.

It was as if his heart was palpitating.

It was a very strange feeling.

Cen Shaoqing looked away uncomfortably.

His symptoms seemed to be getting more and more serious.

It seemed that he had to find ye Zhuo to treat him as soon as possible and prescribe a few sets of traditional Chinese medicine.

Zhou Xiang and the Old Lady Cen picked up all the Coconuts on the ground and put them in a bag for Cen Shaoqing to hold together.

“After picking up the coconuts, the few of them continued to walk towards the island. ”

This was a very beautiful island. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

In the middle of the island sat a luxurious villa with a sea view.

“Standing on the top floor of the villa, one could overlook the beautiful scenery of the entire island. ”

“The garden on the first floor was built with a barbecue area, a swimming pool, a movie hall in the basement, a family KTV, and all kinds of food, drinks, and entertainment. ”

“Because someone had come to clean up in advance, the villa was very clean. On the table in the hall were iced watermelons and sour plum soup to relieve the heat. ”

“Zhou Xiang had watched the video in advance, so she was familiar with the layout of the villa. “Mom, Zhonghua, Shaoqing, I’ll bring you guys to your rooms.” ”

“In order to have a convenient view of the seaside, the rooms were arranged on the top floor. ”

“The four rooms were connected. In order, it was Zhou Xiang, old Mrs. Cen, Ye Zhonghua, and then Cen Shaoqing. ”

“After watching the rooms and taking a short break, Zhou Xiang suggested going to the seaside to swim. ”

Ye Zhuo nodded. “Okay.”

“Old Mrs. Cen said, “My old limbs can’t swim anymore. I’m not as young as you guys. I’ll go take a look at the scenery!” ”

“Zhou Xiang turned to look at Cen Shaoqing. “Shaoqing, are you going?” ”

“Before Cen Shaoqing could say anything, old Mrs. Cen said, “Of course he’s going! If he doesn’t go, who will be our Porter?” ”

Could it be that the three girls were going to do this kind of physical work?

“CEN Shaoqing said, “I just saw a jeep parked in the courtyard. We’ll drive down in a while.” ”

“”If you have a car, you can bring more things! Beach umbrellas, beach chairs, tents, and so on!”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Yezi, Xiangxiang, you guys go and change into your swimsuits. Shaoqing and I will prepare the things.” ”

“”Okay.”Zhou Xiang nodded. “Zhuozhuo, let’s go.” ”

Zhou Xiang and Ye Zhuozhuo went upstairs to change their clothes.

Not long after.

“Ye Zhuozhuo changed his clothes and stood outside the corridor, waiting for Zhou Xiang. ”

“Not long after, Zhou Xiang came out. ”

“Although she was already middle-aged, Zhou Xiang maintained her skin very well. Her skin was not loose at all. She was like a 30-year-old young woman. Her beautiful figure was still very impressive. ”

Zhou Xiang had just opened the door when she saw ye Zhuo waiting for her outside.

“Ye Zhuo was wearing a white swimsuit with a suspenders. The one-word design of the tube top covered her upper body, revealing a slim waist. ”

It was a very slim waist.

There was not a single bit of fat on it. One could clearly see the waistline of her abdomen.

“She was wearing a white boxer swimming trunks underneath, which made her legs look very slender. ”

This figure...

Was simply too...

“It was obviously a very conservative swimsuit, but it made people’s blood boil. Even Zhou Xiang, this woman, almost couldn’t control herself when she saw it. ”

“”Oh my god, searing, you must be very disciplined usually! You actually maintain such a good figure!” ”

“Ye searing smiled and said, “I can’t say that I’m disciplined, but I go for a run every morning.” ”

“Actually, it had something to do with one’s physique. ”

“Ye Zao liked to eat sweets very much. If an ordinary person ate sweets, they would definitely get fat. She had no signs of getting fat. ”
