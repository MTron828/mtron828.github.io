The taste was indeed not that bad.

“Cen Shaoqing ate one mouthful after another. In a short while, he finished eating the entire peach. ”

On the other side.

At the Ye residence.

“Zhao Pingting’s parents, brother, and sister-in-law had specially brought a heavy gift to thank ye Zao. ”

Ye Shu knew ye Zao’s capabilities.

“However, when she learned that ye Zao was the Miracle Doctor Ye on the news, she was still quite shocked. ”

Never in her wildest dreams did she expect that the person who cured cancer was actually her daughter.

“Looking at ye Zhuo’s indifferent expression, as if he did not take this matter to heart, Ye Shu tried her best to calm herself down. ”

“Xiao Bai brought over a few cups of tea that had been brewed. “Distinguished guests, please enjoy your tea!” ”

“Zhao pingting said in surprise, “Zhuo Zhuo, is this robot yours?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zha nodded.

“It’s quite intelligent!”Zhao Pingting looked left and right at little white.

“Little White covered its face and pretended to be shy. “Don’t look at me like that, my face will turn into a red apple…” ”

“F * ck!”Zhao Pingting exclaimed in surprise.

“Little White continued, “Honorable Guest, swearing is an uncivilized behavior!” ”

“What’s Your Name?”Zhao Pingting asked.

“Xiao Bai said proudly, “My name is Xiao Bai Bai, the smartest robot in the Universe!” ”

“Zhao pingting smiled and said, “Then how much does burning pay you to work at Burning House for a month?” ”

“”Very, very high.” ”

“Then what about your salary?”

Xiao Bai tilted his head and thought for a while. “I used my salary to pay the electricity bill.”

“Haha!”

Zhao Pingting was not the only one who laughed. Everyone else in the room also laughed out loud.

In order to make up for the regret that Zhao Pingting did not manage to go to the amusement park last time.

“Ye Zhuo had even made an appointment with Zhao Pingting. After she recovered for a period of time, he called an Lizi and the three of them went to the amusement park again. ”

Today was the day that ye Zhuo was interviewed and broadcast on television.

“At six o’clock in the evening, ye Shu switched the TV to the Yunjing TV station on time. ”

The TV was hung on the wall of the restaurant.

The 90-inch big screen could be seen by all the guests in the hall.

“Everyone was here for the reputation of the top scholar, and now they were all looking forward to the news being broadcast earlier. ”

Soon.

The news was broadcast.

“After the host’s introduction, the screen turned to the scene of the interview with Ye Zao and Ye Shu in the blink of an eye. ”

“It’s Out! It’s Out! The top scorer and the top scorer are out!”

Many people took out their phones to take photos.

“Although it was only two minutes, compared to other news, it was already a long time. ”

“After the broadcast of the top scorer of the college entrance examination in Yunjing, the television station broadcast a clip of the top scorer of the college entrance examination from all over the country. ”

“”This is Wen Aiguo, the top scorer of the liberal arts college entrance examination from Shanghai! Wen Aiguo is 19 years old this year, and he obtained an excellent score of 742 points in the college entrance examination this time!” ”

“”Hello Everyone, I Am Wen Aiguo.” ”

“Because it was a clip, everyone only had one sentence to introduce themselves, or else they would not have enough time. ”

“”This is Lin Ze, the top scholar of the liberal arts college entrance examination from Beijing! Lin Ze is 19 years old this year, and he obtained an excellent score of 749 points in this college entrance examination!” ”

“”Hello Everyone, I Am Lin Ze.” ”

Lin Ze?

“Looking at the youth on the television, Ye Shu’s heart felt as if it was suddenly pinched by someone. At this moment, the pain was suffocating. ”

Was she seeing things?

Why.

“She looked at the youth in front of her, and he looked so much like the person from back then? ”

Even his voice was the same.

Was he his child?

19 years old.

“If this really was his child, didn’t that mean that when he was with her back then, he already had someone else. ”

For so many years.

Ye Shu refused to believe this truth.

“But now, the truth was right in front of her eyes. ”

The wound that was already scabbed was instantly torn into a bloody mess.

That year.

When Ye Shu was giving birth.

A pregnant woman like her came to the door.

She said.

She was already pregnant with their child.

She also said that they were engaged.

The woman berated ye Shu. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

She said that she was a saboteur.

She said that she was a mistress.

“”Cheng is my fiancé now, he will be my husband in the future, the father of the child! I beg you! Please let Cheng Go, okay? Give me and the child a home.” ”

“B * Tch! You are a B * Tch! You destroyed a home with your own hands! A mistress!”

Ye Shu did not believe that Lin Qingcheng would lie to her.

She had been waiting for him all this time.

“From the moment she was pregnant to the day of the birth, she had been waiting for him for a whole month. ”

But it was as if he had disappeared into thin air.
