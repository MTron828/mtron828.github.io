“Ye Zao just stood there, facing the axe that was swinging towards her. There was no fear on her face. Seeing that the axe was about to chop at her, Ye Zao slightly raised her foot and gave a perfect backspin kick. ”

Bang!

The Axe was kicked to the ground.

“Seeing that the axe was kicked to the ground by ye Zao, the Bald Man showed a look of fear and took a few steps back. He still had a gun! ”

“However, ye Zao did not give him the chance to do so. He kicked the trash can on the ground. ”

Whoosh —

The trash can seemed to be tainted with a cold aura as it flew in the direction of the Bald Man.

PA!

The flying trash can was directly placed on the Bald Man’s head.

This scene caused everyone’s eyes to be filled with stars.

“However, this was not the end. Ye Zao gave another side kick. The bald man was kicked to the ground. Ye Zao picked up the rope on the side and tied the bald man up in no time. ”

“Seeing this scene, the women locked in the cage looked at each other and finally burst into tears. ”

These were tears of excitement.

Tears of joy.

They were saved.

They were finally saved.

“Ye Zao tied the bald man to the leg of the table at the side. He walked to Zhao Pingting and untied the rope without saying a word. Then, he took off his black windbreaker and wrapped Zhao Pingting’s body. Only then did he speak in a deep voice, “Sorry, I’m late.” ”

“If she had discovered that Zhao Pingting had disappeared earlier, Zhao Pingting would not have suffered so much damage. ”

No one knew how much damage Zhao Pingting had suffered during this period.

“”Zhuo Zhuo, thank you, thank you!”Zhao Pingting hugged ye Zhuo and cried out loud. ”

“If it wasn’t for Ye Zhuo, she might have really died here. ”

“Ye Zao patted Zhao Pingting’s back. “Alright, everything is fine now. Let’s hurry and let the others out.” ”

“Okay.”Zhao pingting nodded and went to look for the key.

“Every Big Iron Dragon had a lock on it. Without a key, it was impossible to unlock it. ”

“Zhao Pingting searched the only table in the basement and then opened the drawer next to it, but she still couldn’t find the key. Zhao pingting frowned slightly and walked to the Bald Man’s side, kicking him fiercely, “Where’s the key?” ” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The bald man looked at Zhao Pingting with a terrifying cold gaze.

“Zhao Pingting had been tortured terribly in the basement. When she saw the man like this, she was so scared that she took a few steps back. She walked to Ye Zao’s side and held his hand tightly. “Zao Zao, what if you can’t find the key?” ”

“Hearing this, the three women locked in the cage were also very anxious. ”

“She was about to be free, but at the critical moment, she could not find the key! ”

“Don’t be anxious.”

“Ye Zao’s eyebrows remained the same. He walked to one of the cages and pulled the iron lock on it. Only then did he realize that this was a copper lock. The lock core design was relatively complicated. Without the key, it was very difficult to open. Ye Zao frowned slightly, he looked up at the short-haired girl. “Can you lend me the clip on your head?” ”

The short-haired girl was stunned.

Was there a clip on her head?

“A few seconds later, the short-haired girl quickly reacted. She touched the small black clip on her head and handed it to Ye Zao. “Is, is this it?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly and took the clip.

“Just as the short-haired girl was wondering what ye Zao wanted the clip for, she saw ye Zao insert the clip into the keyhole and gently turn it twice. ”

Crack!

The lock was unlocked!

The short-haired girl was overjoyed. “It’s unlocked! It’s unlocked! Thank you! Thank you!”

“After the copper lock was unlocked, Zhao Pingting immediately walked over to help untie the rope tied to the short-haired girl. ”

“Ye Zhuo walked to the second iron cage and used the same method to open the copper lock. The third cage was followed. The three girls all walked out of the iron cage, the one among them who had been locked in there for the longest time had already been locked up for two weeks. Now that she suddenly walked out of the iron cage, it felt especially surreal. ”

They were saved.

They were all saved!

The Ecstasy of having escaped was not something that could be expressed in words.

“At this moment, she looked at Ye Zhuo. ”

She felt that her entire body was glowing.

She was like a savior stepping on a five-colored auspicious cloud.

The three of them stood in a row and walked in front of ye Zhuo and Zhao Pingting. They bowed deeply. “Thank you! Thank you!”

“You don’t have to do this.”Ye Zhuo immediately reached out to help them up.

“The short-haired girl continued, “You’re Our Savior. If we don’t bow to you properly today, we won’t be able to sleep peacefully in the future!” ”
