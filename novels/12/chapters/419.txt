[ Yezi is back! ]

[ Ahhhh! I’m so excited! ]

“[ long time no see, Yap. ] ”

“[ where have you been these past few days, Yap? ] ”

“”A lot of things have happened these past few days. I’ve been pretty busy. Don’t worry, everyone. I’ll be seeing everyone more often in the future.” ”

“[ user: Purple Gold Hammer 1225, a sports car x 10! ] ”

“[ user: that dog, a cloud piercing arrow x 10! ] ”

[ I saw Big Dog and Big Hammer Again! ]

[ there’s still one big brother who hasn’t come. ]

[ is it big beauty? ]

[ waiting for Big Beauty! ]

“[ by the way, Big Beauty is also very powerful. Ye Zi disappeared for thirty days, and he disappeared for thirty days. From the beginning until now, the only person he paid attention to was Ye Zi, the streamer. ] ”

“Because Cen Shaoqing’s Miao Yin username had always been the website’s custom name, and he only gave a gift of a peerless beauty, everyone called him lady boss. ”

“[ user: Miao Yin username 202106080126, giving out a peerless beauty * 10! ] ”

[ F * ck! Lady boss is here! ]

“[ a boss is a boss! He gave out 500,000 in the first place! F * ck! ] ”

“[ Ahhh! Big Shot Beauty, say something! ] ”

[ big shot gold tongue is hard to open. ]

[ I’m really curious what this big shot looks like! ]

Ye Zhuo glanced at the screen. She was also quite curious about this big shot beauty. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“After livestreaming for such a long time, she had met countless nouveau riche, but this was the first time she had met someone like this big shot beauty. ”

This big shot had to give her almost 60 million.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Let me livestream a game of chess for you guys first. Then, let’s play a game.” ”

[ Okay! ]

“[ no problem! Ye, hurry up and start. It’s been a long time since I’ve experienced such a passionate feeling. ] ”

“As soon as ye Zhuo finished speaking, her in-game friend [ layabout scholar ] sent her a PK invitation. ”

[ hahaha! The unlucky guy is here again! ]

[ I suspect that the unlucky guy is watching ye Zao’s livestream as well! ]

Ye Zao accepted the challenge.

“It took a total of 35 minutes, and in the end, Ye Zao won. ”

“However, it was obvious that the opponent’s go skills had improved a lot. ”

“After playing chess, ye Zao opened Lol again. ”

Cen Shaoqing on the other end of the screen also quickly opened LOL.

Ye Zao played the free match.

“In order to match ye Zao, Cen Shaoqing even specially wrote a script. Although he was beaten terribly by Ye Zao in every game, Cen Shaoqing still enjoyed it. ”

“At this time, Ye Zao’s new live stream entry had already appeared in the wonderful sound entry. ”

“# Ye, finally waiting for you! # ”

# YC is officially open for business #

“# after 30 days, YC is back! # ”

“In an instant, the number of people in Ye Zhuo’s live broadcast room soared from 100,000 to 300,000. ”

“Although ye Zhuo did not sign with any company, did not join a union, and did not even show her face during the live broadcast, this did not stop her from becoming popular! She did not need any promotion or marketing at all! ”

She was the traffic herself!

This was also the reason why many companies spared no expense to sign with Ye Zhuo.

On the other side.

Beijing.

Feng Qianhua was still delivering health soup to Old Lady Lin Day After Day.

“Every time, she would make it herself. ”

“Today, Feng Qianhua was still delivering soup to Old Lady Lin on time. ”

“Feng Xianxian said, “Mom, I won’t be going today. You can go by yourself.” ”

“Why aren’t you going?”Feng Qianhua turned to look at Feng Xianxian.

“Feng Xianxian said, “Today is Zhilan’s birthday. I have to go to her birthday party.” ”

“Although Feng Qianhua had high expectations of Feng Qianqian, as long as Feng Qianqian did not have promiscuous relationships and mingled with those poor people, she would never restrict Feng Qianqian’s social interaction. ”

“Her daughter, Feng Qianhua, was born with nobility. Of course, she could not hang out with those indecent people! ”

Zheng Zhilan was the daughter of the song family. The song family had a prominent position in the capital. Feng Qianhua could not wish for Feng Qianqian to have a good friend like Zheng Zhilan.

“This meant that her daughter, Feng Qianhua, was capable! ”

She was destined to stand at the top and look down on everything!

Feng Qianhua took out a card from her bag. “Remember to buy a better gift.”

The song family was not an ordinary family. Buying such a cheap gift would only cause them to lose face.

“Feng Qianxian recognized this card. It was given to Feng Qianhua by Old Lady Lin, and there was a lot of money in it. She did not expect Feng Qianhua to be so generous this time. She took the card and said, “Thank you, Mom.” ”

Feng Qianhua nodded. “Go ahead. I’ll get old Zhang to send you.”

“Okay.”

“Afraid that Feng Qianhua would be wronged in the Feng family, the driver, Old Zhang, and the car were also given to them by Mrs. Lin. ”
