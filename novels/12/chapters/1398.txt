Chapter 1399: 293: confess the truth (Sixth Watch)1

Translator: 549690339

Zheng Wanyin was brought up by Xie Wanqiu. She knew Zheng Wanyin very well.

“As long as Zheng Wanyin knew that Wu Youyu was her biological grandfather, Zheng Wanyin would definitely be very filial to Wu Youyu. ”

“Wu youyu continued, “Wanqiu, you don’t know how much my heart ached when I saw yinyin calling Zhou Zuolong grandfather! Yinyin is clearly my granddaughter. What qualifications does Zhou zuolong have?” ”

“”I know, I know, I know.”Xie wanqiu buttoned her shirt. “Brother youyu, I’ll find an opportunity to tell yinyin about this today.” ”

“Really?”Wu Youyu’s eyes lit up.

Xie wanqiu nodded. “Of course it’s true.”

“Wu Youyu hugged Xie wanqiu excitedly. “Darling, you’re So Good to me!” ”

Outside.

“Zheng Wanyin was worried that Zhou Zuolong might have discovered something. She raised her head and looked at Zhou Zuolong. “Grandpa, why didn’t I know that Grandma doesn’t like apples and Pears?” ”

“Zhou zuolong smiled and said, “You Silly Child, can’t you tell? “I’m giving Your Grandpa Wu and Grandma a chance to be alone together. Your Grandma’s life hasn’t been easy. She married me far away in sea city and usually doesn’t even have anyone to talk to. It’s not easy to meet her childhood friends, so of course, we have to let them spend more time together. With us around, there are some things that they definitely can’t say.” ”

Zheng Wanyin rolled her eyes in her heart.

“As expected, she had overestimated Zhou Zuolong’s IQ. ”

How could a fool like Zhou Zuolong discover anything?

“It was fine if he did not discover anything, but he actually took the initiative to give Xie Wanqiu and Wu Youyu a chance to be alone together. ”

Wasn’t this putting a cuckold on his own head?

“It was fine if he put a cuckold on himself, but what was even more unexpected was that Zhou Zuolong felt that a cuckold was not green enough and even personally painted the cuckold. ”

This kind of person deserved to be cuckolded!

“Zheng wanyin continued, “So that’s how it is. Grandfather, you’re really too good to Grandma! Oh right, let’s buy some raisins later! I remember that uncle likes to eat that the most! Didn’t uncle come over to see you today?” ”

“Hearing that, Zhou zuolong snorted coldly, “It’s a good thing that you still remember that unfilial son! But you remember him, does he remember you?” ”

“Zheng Wanyin giggled as she held Zhou Zuolong’s arm. “It’s fine if he doesn’t remember me. It’s fine as long as I remember him. Moreover, I’m a junior and he’s an elder. It’s only right that I remember him.” ”

“Zhou Zuolong sighed. “You Child, you’re just like your grandmother. Everything is good except that you’re too kind!” ”

“You’re born to be a person. It’s only right that you’re kind!”Zheng Wanyin said.

Zhou Zuolong shook his head helplessly.

“Zheng wanyin continued, “Oh right, grandfather, let’s hurry back after buying the fruits! Don’t let Uncle Come later, you’re not around.” ”

“”Then let him wait!”Zhou zuolong said, “I’m his father. What’s wrong with letting him wait for me?” ”

“Zheng wanyin smiled and said, “Uncle is a busy person. Time is money to him. Let’s not let him wait too long.” ”

Zhou Zuolong was not willing to go back early.

“Firstly, he wanted to teach Zhou Jinbei a lesson. Otherwise, Zhou Jinbei and Zhou Xiang would be the same. They would never know who was the son and who was the father. ”

“Secondly, Zhou Zuolong really wanted Xie wanqiu and Wu Youyu to spend more time together. ”

“Zhou Zuolong did not want to go back, so Zheng Wanyin had no choice but to accompany Zhou Zuolong and find a teahouse to drink tea. ”

“After drinking for more than two hours, they finally headed to the hospital. ”

“Zhou Zuolong thought that Zhou Jinbei had arrived quite a while after he returned to the hospital, but he did not expect that there was no one else in the ward besides Xie Wanqiu. ”

Zhou Zuolong frowned. “That unfilial son didn’t come?”

“Xie wanqiu nodded. “Old Man, don’t be in a hurry to get angry. Maybe it’s because we’re too busy in north China, so we’ll come over later.” ”

“It’s already past twelve o’clock. How many children would visit their sick mother in the afternoon?”The people of Hai Cheng were the most particular about this.

“Usually, only those who paid their condolences would choose the afternoon. ”

Visiting patients was always in the morning.

“And Zhou Jinbei knew about this custom, yet he deliberately chose to come in the afternoon. If this wasn’t intentional, then what was? ”

He just wanted Xie Wanqiu to die.

An unfilial son.

“Xie wanqiu smiled and said, “Forget it, forget it. How many parents would argue about this with their own children?” ”

“Xie wanqiu could not argue with Zhou Jinbei, but Zhou Zuolong could not. Xie wanqiu had been married to him for so many years, and she had already been wronged. But now, Zhou Jinbei actually let Xie wanqiu suffer this humiliation! ”

“As a husband, Zhou Zuolong had to vent his anger on Xie wanqiu. He continued, “Later, I have to teach that unfilial son a good lesson. You Can’t stop him!” ”

“Xie wanqiu said, “Old man, why are you doing this?” ”

“At this moment, Zhou Zuolong seemed to have suddenly thought of something. He continued, “Oh right, where’s brother Wu?” ”

“”Brother Youyu went to the washroom outside,”Xie wanqiu said. ”

“”Outside?”Zhou zuolong asked in puzzlement, “Isn’t there a washroom inside?” ”

“Xie wanqiu smiled and said, “Brother Youyu is a particular person. I’m alone in the room. If he goes to the washroom, I’m afraid that someone would spread the news. Besides, my identity is a little awkward.” ”

Zhou Zuolong sighed. “This brother Wu is really a good person!”

“”If Brother Youyu wasn’t a good person, he wouldn’t have risked his life to save me from the water back then.”Xie wanqiu continued, “If it weren’t for brother youyu back then, I wouldn’t be the person I am now. I really didn’t even dream that I would be able to meet brother youyu in my lifetime.” ”

“Zhou zuolong said, “Wanqiu, this means that you and brother Wu are fated!” ”

Xie wanqiu’s eyes were filled with ridicule.

No wonder Wu Youyu dared to cheat on Zhou Zuolong. This Zhou Zuolong was really stupid.

“Wu Youyu treated him as a green bastard, and he was extremely grateful to Wu Youyu. ”

Calling him stupid was simply insulting the word ‘stupid’.

“At this moment, footsteps sounded from outside the door. ”

“Wu Youyu walked over from outside. “Brother Zhou, you’re back.” ”

“Brother Wu.”Zhou Zuolong turned to look at Wu Youyu.

“Wu youyu continued, “Brother Zhou, I’ve been waiting for you for a long time. I originally wanted to spar with you, but it’s too late now. I have to go back first.” ”

“”So Soon?”Zhou zuolong continued, “It’s almost time to eat. Brother Wu, let’s Go! Let’s go to the restaurant and have a good drink before we leave!” ”

“Wu Youyu said with some difficulty, “This...” ”

“Xie wanqiu smiled and said, “Brother Youyu, you’re a good drinker. My husband is also a good drinker. You should accompany him to have a drink! Otherwise, he won’t be able to sleep at ease tonight.” ”

“Wu Youyu thought for a moment and said, “Since wanqiu, you’re already so rich, then I’ll go and have a drink with brother Zhou!” ”

“Zhou Zuolong immediately held onto Wu Youyu’s arm. He looked as if he was afraid that Wu Youyu would regret it in the next second. “Let’s go, let’s go have a drink.” ” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“As he finished speaking, Zhou Zuolong turned around and looked at Xie wanqiu. “If that unfilial son returns, tell him to wait for me. When I return, I’ll teach him a good lesson! If he dares to challenge me, I think he’s tired of living!” ”

“Got it.”Xie wanqiu nodded.

“Looking at the back view of Zhou Zuolong and Wu Youyu leaving, Xie Wanqiu narrowed her eyes. ”

“When Zheng Wanyin walked in after washing the fruits, Zhou Zuolong and Wu Youyu were already gone. Zheng wanyin asked curiously, “Grandma, where are Grandpa and Grandpa Wu?” ”

“”They went out to drink.”Xie wanqiu sat on the bed and looked at Zheng Wanyin. She continued, “Yinyin, go and close the door. Grandma has something to tell you.” ”

“Zheng Wanyin nodded and walked over to close the door. Then, she sat beside Xie Wanqiu. ”

“Xie wanqiu held Zheng Wanyin’s hand. “Yinyin, you’re a smart child. You should be able to tell that your grandfather Wu and I have a special relationship, right?” ”

Zheng Wanyin was stunned.

She did not expect Xie wanqiu to suddenly tell her this. She did not expect that Xie wanqiu would personally uncover this cover.

What was Xie Wanqiu trying to do?

“”Grandma, Why did you betray Grandpa?”Zheng Wanyin asked ”

“”Betray?”The corners of Xie Wanqiu’s mouth curled into a mocking smile. “Your Grandpa Wu and I have known each other for more than forty years. It was clearly Zhou Zuolong who interfered! If it wasn’t for him, I would have been with your Grandpa Wu long ago.” ”

“What?”Zheng Wanyin was a little surprised.

“Xie wanqiu continued, “Your Grandpa Wu and I were originally a couple. Also, your biological grandfather didn’t die at all. As for who he is, yinyin, you’re so smart. You should be able to guess it, right?” ”

“When they were in love, Xie Wanqiu and Wu Youyu’s relationship was very good. ”

“However, no matter how good the relationship was, it had to be maintained by money. Otherwise, everything would be meaningless. ”

“For the sake of money, Xie Wanqiu married her first husband. Unfortunately, he was a short-lived ghost. She lost out on her business and jumped off a building to commit suicide. ”

“Later, Xie Wanqiu turned her gaze to Zhou Zuolong. ”

“Zheng wanyin said in disbelief, “You... you mean, Grandpa Wu is my biological grandfather?” ”
