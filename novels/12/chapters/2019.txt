“En.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Yi Ling looked at Ye Zao. “Da Zao Zao, you really promised me?” ”

“It kept feeling that ye Zao was lying to it, but it had no evidence. ”

“With Ye Zao’s personality, she wouldn’t compromise so easily. ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Of course it’s true! When have I ever lied to You?” ”

“Thinking about it carefully, ye Zao had never lied to her. ”

Only then did Yi Ling relax.

“Soon, the flying machine flew to a building and stopped. ”

This was where ye Zao was staying.

Ye Zao walked out of the Flying Machine.

“Yi Ling followed behind ye Zao and flew out, asking curiously: “Da Zao Zao, what is that Gu? Does it only exist on earth? What does it look like?” ”

“”En.”Ye Zao nodded slightly, “Currently, the GU only exists on Earth.” ” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The climate of Changyue was not suitable for the GU poison to reproduce.

It was just like how mules and mules could not reproduce.

“Even if the Gu survived on Planet E-TY889, it could not reproduce. ”

“Then how did it come to Planet E-TY889?”Yi Ling asked.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “This matter has something to do with the Great Witch Doctor. I’ve observed that the Gu poison that lives in ye Han’s body is the evolved form of the Gu Poison on Earth.” ”

“”Evolved form?”Yi Ling asked, “Does that mean it’s even more powerful than the GU on earth?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Not only was it powerful, it was more than ten times more powerful. ”

That was why the purple leaf flower was needed to detoxify the poison.

Ordinary gu poison could be detoxified with the Gu detoxification grass.

“But where did the Great Witch Doctor Get This Gu from?”Yi Ling asked.

“Ye Zhuo said, “The Great Witch Doctor is good at using evil doctors. Before he was 10 years old, he had experienced on earth, so it’s not uncommon for him to know Gu Poison.” ”

“Compared to Planet E-TY889, the conditions on Earth were harsh and the technology was backward. It was comparable to primitive tribes. Therefore, in order to train the survival ability of their children, some families would send their newborn children to Earth. ”

“Yi ling nodded, “So that’s how it is!” ”

“Ye Zhuo walked to the research table and stopped, “Dog, come here.” ”

“What’s Wrong?”Yi Ling flew over.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Didn’t you want to know what a Gu looks like?” ”

“After saying this, Ye Zhuo opened the lid of the round porcelain on the table. ”

“Inside the round porcelain, a black worm was squirming at the bottom. ”

The tail was dragging an unknown brown-green liquid.

“Looking at it like this, it was very disgusting. ”

It was hard to imagine what it felt like for such a worm to live in a person’s body.

Yi Ling covered her nose with her wings. “Oh my God! It’s so disgusting! Is this a Gu?”

“En.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Yi Ling continued, “Da Zao Zao, why are you studying this for no reason?” ”

Ye Zao cut his finger and dripped a drop of blood into it. “Give him a taste of his own medicine.”

“As soon as the blood dripped into the bottom of the porcelain, green smoke immediately rose. ”

She was using her blood to nourish the GU worm.

“Give him a taste of his own medicine.”Yi Ling seemed to have thought of something. “Oh! I know! You want the Great Witch Doctor to taste the taste of the Gu Worm?”

“”Yes.”Ye Zhuo continued, “There are poisonous insects that feed gu here. Remember to feed them in the morning, in the afternoon, and at night.” ”

“”Ah?”Yi Ling was stunned. “Great Burning, where are you going?” ”

“I’m not going anywhere. I’m just afraid that I’ll forget to feed them occasionally.”Ye Zhuo said.

“OH.”Yi Ling nodded. “I know.”

Ye Zhuo picked up the incense beside him and lit it up.

It smelled good.

PA —

“The next second, Yi Ling fell from the sky onto the table and fell into a deep sleep. ”

Ye Zhuo picked up the blanket beside him and covered it.

“Then, Ye Zhuo picked up a pen and wrote a line on the paper: ”

“I am in the Eternal Glacier, take care of myself and the Gu Worms. ”

Do not look for them.

“Ye Zhuo, stay. ”

“After doing all this, Ye Zhuo boarded the flying ball and flew towards the Eternal Glacier, looking for the purple leaf flower. ”

On the other side.

The Great Witch doctor arrived at the Qiu family home.

“He came under the cover of night, but no one noticed him. ”

“There are only two days left until the election. Are You Ready?”The Great Witch Doctor looked at Qiu Di.

“Qiu Di nodded. “Don’t worry, everything is ready.” ”

She now had the password to open the files of the inter-planetary case.

The support of the eight great families.

Ye Lan’s defection.

What was there to be afraid of?

The Great Witch Doctor nodded. “You must not make any mistakes at such a critical moment.”

“”Don’t worry,”Qiu di said. ”

The Great Witch Doctor turned the two night pearls in his palm. “Where’s Yi Ling?”

Yi Ling?

Qiu Di was stunned.

What did the Great Witch Doctor Mean?

Didn’t the Great Witch Doctor Know That Yi Ling was missing?

Why would he ask again?
