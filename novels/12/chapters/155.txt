Chapter 156: 085: the Clever Lin Ze, the great scorching hot who had just debuted! 8

Zhao Pingting asked with a puzzled look, “What’s wrong with Lizi?”

Ye Zhuo shook his head. “Maybe she really has something on.”

When they came downstairs, an Lizi looked over again. The man and woman were still there.

An Lizi held back the overwhelming emotions in her heart. She took out her phone and took a few photos before turning around to leave.

An Lizi’s family operated a small supermarket.

Usually, an Lizi’s mother, Xia Xiaoman, operated the supermarket.

The small supermarket had a total of three floors.

The first floor was the vegetable grain and oil area, the second floor was the snacks and furniture daily necessities area, and the third floor was their own living quarters.

As soon as an Lizi entered, she saw her mother exchanging goods with the Tallyman of the supermarket.

“Mom.”

An Lizi walked over.

“You’re back.”Xia Xiaoman turned around with a smile. “Lizi, didn’t you say you were having dinner with your classmates? Why are you back so early?”

An Lizi didn’t answer Xia Xiaoman directly. Instead, she asked, “Mom, Where’s My Dad?”

......

“He went to stock up,”Xia Xiaoman answered.

“When did he go?”

Xia Xiaoman said, “He went in the morning. Why?”

An Lizi opened her mouth but didn’t know what to say. “Mom, why didn’t You Call My Dad?”

Xia Xiaoman smiled and said, “What’s there to rush? Your Dad Isn’t a kid anymore. He’ll come back when the goods are ready! What’s wrong with you today, Kid?”

“Nothing!”An Lizi patted the dust off Xia Xiaoman’s body. “Mom, why didn’t You Dress Yourself Up?”

Xia Xiaoman was speechless. “Why are you acting so weird today? One minute you’re asking where your dad went, and the next minute you’re asking me to dress up. What’s Wrong?”

“Mom, I’m going upstairs to do my homework.”

“Go ahead.”Xia Xiaoman nodded.

When she went upstairs, an Lizi was not in the mood to do her homework at all. All she could think about was the image of her father with that woman.

Never in her wildest dreams did she expect that her father, the father she loved the most, the father who was usually honest, would cheat on her!

Such a dramatic thing had actually happened to her.

She did not know what to do!

An Lizi lay on the bed, her mood very heavy. She could not help but take out the photo she had taken

She hoped that she had only seen wrongly at that time.

However, no matter how many times she looked at it, the image in the photo did not change.

That person was her father.

After an unknown period of time, the voices of her parents came from the living room.

“I’ve already eaten at home. Why do you still want to spend money on this?”

It was Xia Xiaoman’s voice.

“This shop has a good business and the taste is not bad. When Old Zhang and I went there, there was a long line. I thought that you and Lizi would like to eat it too.”

It was an Dongliang’s voice.

An Lizi instantly woke up and dragged her slippers outside.

As expected, her good father had returned.

“Lizi, come over quickly. Look What Daddy brought back for You!”

An Lizi walked over to take a look.

It was the food that was brought back from the Ye family’s private house.

If an Lizi had not seen that scene today, she would have been very happy. However, she would not be so happy now.

There was a pile of leftovers.

An Lizi felt disgusted.

It was one thing for an Dongliang to go out to meet his mistress, but now he had brought back the leftovers.

Xia Xiaoman, who did not know what was going on, was still eating happily. “Lizi, the taste of this restaurant is not bad. Try It.”

An Lizi tried her best to control her emotions and took the food from Xia Xiaoman’s hands. “Mom! Stop eating! Eating too much junk food is not good for your health!”

Xia Xiaoman was stunned. “Lizi! What’s wrong with you today?”

An Dongliang also felt that there was something wrong with an Lizi.

This daughter of his had always been obedient and obedient. “Lizi, did you encounter something unhappy? Tell me, I’ll help you analyze it.”

An Lizi looked at an dongliang like this.

She felt that it was ironic.

The good father in her eyes and the good husband in her mother’s eyes were completely different people.

At this moment, an Lizi only wanted to ask loudly, why did he betray his mother!

“It’s nothing.”An Lizi threw all the leftovers on the table into the trash can. “I just feel that eating too much junk food at night is not good for my health.”

After saying this, an Lizi turned around and returned to her room. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“This child, What’s Wrong?”An Dongliang scratched the back of his head with a puzzled look.

Xia Xiaoman frowned and said, “Lizi isn’t usually like this! Did she not do well in the exam?”

An Lizi returned to her room and hugged her pillow as she cried out loud.

She wanted to find someone to talk to and help her make decisions. However, she could not reveal her dirty laundry to the public, not to mention that this person was her father!

She did not know who to look for either. At this moment, she suddenly thought of the kind of relationship specialist that could be paid for online. Hence, she took out her phone and looked for a professional-looking specialist, she anonymously described her encounter and sent it to the specialist.

The specialist quickly replied. It was a woman’s voice that sounded very gentle.

“Hello, my advice to You is that you’d better pretend that you didn’t see anything and don’t interfere in the matters between your parents. You have to believe that your father is still the same father who loves you! He will not reduce his care and love for you because of this. “If you insist on exposing this layer of window paper, then what you will face is the fragmentation of a family. I believe that your mother, who is also a woman, will certainly not be willing to face this fact.”
