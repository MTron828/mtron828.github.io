Chapter 199: 089: Lin Jin city’s secret, brother Ze who dug up the trap, so domineering! 5

“Didn’t I just leave for a while?”Feng Qianqian felt very wronged, “Do you have to be like this? I’m your biological daughter! You actually hit me for some lousy medicine! What’s the use of being so nice to that Old Woman! She still hasn’t let you pass!”

Feng Qianqian took the college entrance exam this year.

In order to help Feng Qianhua win her reputation, Feng Qianqian planned to enter Beijing University.

Even if she couldn’t get the best scholar in the city, she still had to get into the top three in the city!

There wasn’t much time left before the college entrance exam. At this crucial time, she couldn’t relax at all.

Feng Qianhua went to the toilet for ten to twenty minutes and didn’t come back. Feng Qianqian was afraid that she would delay her studies, so she asked the maid at home to take a look. She didn’t expect Feng Qianhua’s reaction to be so big.

“Slap!”

Feng Qianhua raised her hand and slapped again!

“Mom!”Feng Qianqian felt even more wronged. She looked up at Feng Qianhua and said loudly, “You don’t have the ability to marry into the Lin family, so you want to vent your anger on me? I’m your daughter! I’m not your punching Bag!”

Feng Qianhua was so angry that her whole body was trembling. She pointed at the door and said, “Go back to your room and think about it!”

Feng Xianxian covered her face with her hands and left the kitchen in tears.

Feng Qianhua looked at Feng Xianxian’s back.

She sighed helplessly.

......

Feng Xianxian was good at everything.

But she was too inexperienced and easily impulsive.

In a moment, Feng Qianhua poured out the health-preserving soup and put it in a special insulated bucket. She was ready to deliver the soup to Old Lady Lin. Just as she walked out of the door, Feng Qianhua turned back and came to the third floor. She reached out and knocked on the door of Feng Xianxian’s room.

Through the door, she could hear Feng Qianxian’s gasping.

She was clearly inside, but she refused to open the door.

Feng Qianhua frowned. “There’s a limit to a person’s patience! I’ll count to three. If you don’t open the door, I’ll get someone to knock it open!”

“Three, two...”

Just as she was about to count to one, the door opened.

Feng Qianqian looked very miserable now.

Her eyes were swollen.

Her face was also swollen.

Feng Qianhua walked in, put the insulated box on the desk, and locked the door behind her.

“Qianqian, are you still blaming Mom?”

Feng Qianqian didn’t say anything.

How could she not be?

Although Feng Qianhua was usually quite strict with her, it was the first time she slapped her face. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

She was a girl.

Feng Qianhua did this without any consideration for her dignity.

Feng Qianhua sighed. “Xianxian, in this family, only the two of us are relatives, blood-related relatives. So, apart from you, mom doesn’t have anyone else who can trust you.”

Feng Qianhua paused. “Can you understand what mom said?”

“Isn’t it just a bowl of medicine? Do you have to make me get slapped twice? Don’t tell me that in your eyes, I’m less important than that old hag from the Lin Family?”Feng Xianxian continued, “I can make that old hag smile from ear to ear with just three pairs of socks that cost ten yuan. Does she care if you personally brewed this bowl of medicine? What’s wrong with letting the maid take a look?”

Feng Qianqian just couldn’t understand this logic.

She thought that Feng Qianhua was making a mountain out of a molehill.

Actually, there was no need for this!

Feng Qianqian couldn’t understand even more why Feng Qianhua had to personally brew the medicine for Old Madam Lin every day for ten years.

Feng Qianhua looked at Feng qianqian and said, “Qianqian, mother has a reason for doing this. One day, you will understand mother’s intentions.”

“I don’t understand!”

“It doesn’t matter if you don’t understand now.”Feng Qianhua sighed, “But one day, you will understand! “All you need to know now is that mother is doing this for your own good. It’s all for the sake of your future! “Only when mother successfully marries into the Lin family will you, as the granddaughter of the Lin family, have the chance to marry Fifth Master Cen!”

At the mention of Fifth Master Cen, the anger on Feng Xianxian’s face disappeared a little.

Feng Qianhua continued, “Xianxian, you’re too impulsive. Can’t you think about why I hit you? Is there really no reason for me to hit you?”

Feng Xianxian was too young.

There were many things that she could not tell her.

“Mother, are you hiding something from me?”Feng Xianxian was not a fool. She immediately understood the meaning behind Feng Qianhua’s words.

“Go figure it out yourself.”Feng Qianhua stood up. “I have to send the health soup to your grandma Lin’s place.”

“I’ll go too!”

Feng Xianxian stood up as well, but when she thought of the injury on her face, she sat down again.

Her face was going to be disfigured soon!

How could she face others?
