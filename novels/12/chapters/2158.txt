“At this point, man xing sighed and continued, “It’s a pity that my words are too light.” ”

“Among the people who despised Earth and its culture, man Xing appeared fresh and refined. ”

Cherish food.

Old Mrs. Cen had experienced famine on Earth. No one knew the value of food better than her.

“In that era where food was scarce, how many people were starved to death? ”

Manxing’s words hit the old lady’s heart.

It had to be said that Manxing’s EQ was really high.

“Not only could he become friends with Duanmu Feng, but he could also curry favor with old Mrs. Cen. ”

Old Mrs. Cen nodded and looked at Manxing with a smile. “You’re the first person I’ve met in the s galaxy who’s so enlightened.”

“Manxing smiled and said, “Thank you for your praise. Actually, there are many people who are more outstanding than me. It’s just that the s galaxy is too big and you didn’t notice it.” ”

“”No, no, no.”Old Mrs. Cen shook her head. “You’re definitely the most outstanding girl I’ve ever met!” ”

“It was rare for CEN yueying to see a young man who took the initiative to talk to Old Mrs. Cen. She smiled and walked over. “Grandma, who is this?” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen smiled and introduced Cen Yueying. “This is Manxing. Little girl has her own ideas. Little Girl, this is my third granddaughter, Cen Yueying.” ”

“Manxing raised his head gracefully and looked at CEN yueying. “Hello, third Miss Cen. I’m Manxing.” ”

“Hello.”Cen yueying shook hands with Manxing.

All of this fell into Duanmu Fengyu’s eyes.

Duanmu fengyu frowned slightly. It would be a lie if she said that she did not feel anything.

“After all, she had been trying to curry favor with old lady cen for so long without any effect. Yet, man Xing only spent a few minutes talking and laughing with Old Lady Cen. ”

What method did man Xing use.

She was curious and unconsciously moved her feet to the side.

“Man Xing’s Back was facing Duanmu Fengyu, so she did not see Duanmu Fengyu. ”

“Old Lady Cen held man Xing’s hand and said, “Man Xing, I really like you! Unlike some little sparrows who don’t even look in the mirror when they go out, someone like her still wants to stick to her door. It’s disgusting!” ”

“Man Xing said gently, “Old lady, there are good people and bad people in this world. There are people who overestimate themselves. You Don’t have to bother with them. “Actually, sometimes, they don’t mean it. They’re just used to living like this.” ”

Duanmu Feng and her anger rose from the bottom of their hearts.

What a man Xing!

“He was a person in front of her, but behind her was a ghost. ”

She had thought that man Xing was a good person!

“If man Xing was really a good person, he wouldn’t have fawned on Old Lady Cen! ”

Duanmu Feng and her clenched her fists and turned to leave. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Man Xing looked at Old Madam Cen and felt that it was about time. If he continued to stay by her side, it would be counterproductive, “Old Madam, I’ll go over there first. If you have time, you’re welcome to visit man Xing country as a guest.” ”

“”Okay, okay, okay.”Old Madam Cen nodded. ”

“Looking at man Xing’s back, cen yueying sighed, “Such a girl is really rare! She’s as calm as a lotus and speaks elegantly. It’s a pity that I only have one younger brother. Otherwise, I really want her to be my second brother’s wife!” ”

It was the first time she had met such a friendly person in the alliance.

“Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “Some People’s scheming is written on their faces, while some people’s scheming is hidden in their hearts.” ”

“At this point, old Mrs. Cen looked at CEN yueying and said, “You, in the end, are still too inexperienced!” ”

“Cen Yueying scratched her head and asked, “What do you mean?” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen looked in the direction where Manxing had disappeared and said, “That Manxing is obviously an extremely shrewd person. She’s the same as Duanmu Fengyu, but Duanmu Fengyu’s status is not as high as hers.” ”

“Compared to Manxing, Duanmu Feng’s acting skills were not even enough. ”

“”Then why are you chatting with her so happily!”CEN yueying continued, “I almost thought that you were going to treat her as your own granddaughter!” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen rolled her eyes at Cen Yueying. “What do you know! That’s called throwing bricks to attract jade, causing them to have internal strife.” ”

Only when these two women fought would no one bother ye Zhuo.

“Cen yueying understood what old Mrs. Cen meant. She smiled and said, “But, grandma, are you sure that this is how you use throwing bricks to attract jade?” ”

“I said it myself. I’ll use it however I want!”Old Mrs. Cen said with a proud face.

“Cen yueying followed Old Mrs. Cen’s footsteps and continued, “But how did you see through the Stars?” ”
