That was why Lin Jincheng had brought his hair to be examined at the first moment. He had to use the facts to Tell Old Lady Lin that there was still a biological granddaughter in this world who shared the same bloodline as her!

“Ye Zhuo was the granddaughter of the Lin family, the biological granddaughter, the only granddaughter! ”

“Lin Ze frowned, not understanding Lin Jincheng’s words. ”

“It was clearly Lin Jincheng who had brought his hair to be examined, so why did he say that he wanted to give ye Shu an explanation? ”

“Lin Jincheng looked at Lin Ze. “Ah Ze, come with me.” ”

Lin Ze followed Lin Jincheng’s footsteps.

The father and son walked to the resting area.

“Lin Jincheng continued, “Actually, I went to Yun Jing to look for your mother last year, but at that time, your sister wasn’t your sister.” ”

Your sister wasn’t your sister?

Lin Ze was even more confused.

“What do you mean?”Lin Ze narrowed his eyes.

“Lin Jincheng spoke slowly, “When you and your sister were born, your grandmother didn’t expect that your mother was pregnant with twins, so she only carried you away. However, your sister was carried by a nurse and another child wrongly in the hospital! “Last April, when I went to Yun Jing, your sister hadn’t switched back with the child that she carried wrongly, so your grandmother and I misunderstood your mother... ... And your grandmother went to the doctor, and the Doctor said that fraternal twins can have different fathers . . ...” ”

“Speaking of this, Lin Jincheng’s voice all choked up. ”

He thought he was so stupid.

Why didn’t he ask ye Shu directly!

Lin went on to say:

“I did it to prove to your grandmother and the world that your mother has never done anything to me! She’s a good woman! I Can’t let them misunderstand your mother! I want to bring your mother and your sister to our house openly!”

Lin Ze didn’t expect there to be a misunderstanding.

No Wonder Old Mrs. Lin kept saying that ye Shu was promiscuous...

Lin Ze sighed in his heart. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Initially, Lin Ze was still blaming Lin Jincheng for not believing ye Shu. After hearing Lin Jincheng’s words, Lin Ze suddenly felt no anger in his heart. ”

The capital hospital had the most advanced appraisal equipment in the world.

The results were out five hours later.

“Seeing the appraisal results, Lin Jincheng was not surprised at all. He took the appraisal report back to the Lin family home. ”

Old Mrs. Lin was still lying on the bed.

Feng Qianhua was in the room with old Mrs. Lin.

“Seeing Lin Jincheng and Lin Ze return, Feng Qianhua looked up at Lin Jincheng and tried her best to act as if nothing had happened. “Brother Jincheng.” ”

“Now that things had come to this, she could not show the slightest bit of blame for Lin Jincheng’s behavior. ”

She wanted to retreat in order to advance and make Lin Jincheng feel guilty.

“As long as Old Lady Lin was around, she was not afraid that Lin Jincheng would not apologize to her. ”

“At that time, she would still be the mistress of the Lin family. ”

Feng Qianhua did not think that Lin Jincheng had the courage to look for ye Shu.

“After all, Ye Shu had cheated on him before. No man would not mind being cheated on by the woman he loved the most. ”

“As long as Lin Jincheng did not look for ye Shu, he would never find out that he had the wrong child. ”

Old Mrs. Lin sat up from the bed and pointed at Lin Jincheng. “Unfilial son! You still know to come back! Quickly apologize to Qianhua! Ask her to forgive you!”

“Lin Jincheng looked at Old Mrs. Lin and his tone was a little cold. “Aren’t you the one who should apologize? If you didn’t ask Secretary Zhang to secretly change the diary, my memory would be messed up and I would mistake her for a Shu?” ”

Ah Shu?

“Hearing these two words, Feng Qianhua’s heart turned cold and her face turned slightly pale. ”

Lin Jincheng called Ye Shu Ah Shu?

Ah Shu!

“She had waited for Lin Jincheng for so many years, but Lin Jincheng had never called her so intimately. ”

Not even once!

Not even once!

What right did she have to that B * Tch ye Shu?

“Feng Qianhua clenched her fingers tightly, her whole body trembling slightly. She wished she could tear ye Shu apart. ”

“Old Mrs. Lin looked up at Lin Jincheng, she said angrily, “So what if I asked someone to change your diary? You and Qianhua are supposed to be a couple! The two of you are a match made in heaven! Ye Shu is a promiscuous woman. What right does she have for you to treat her like this? ! Is Ye Shu Worthy?” ”

“Lin Ze finally found his mother with much difficulty. He could not tolerate anyone saying anything bad about ye Shu. “My mother is not promiscuous. Grandma, you have misunderstood her!” ”

“Shut up!”Old Mrs. Lin glared at Lin Ze.

“Lin Jincheng tried his best to calm himself down. “Mom, you’ve really misunderstood Ah Shu. Ah Shu didn’t betray me from start to finish. That child is mine too!” ”

“”What did you say?”Old Mrs. Lin was furious when she heard this. “You mean you want to admit that bastard? It’s not enough to be a green bastard, but you still want to be that bastard’s father?” ”

Be that bastard’s father?

“As long as she was still alive, Lin Jincheng could forget about it! ”

“”That’s my daughter! She’s not some bastard!”Lin Jincheng took out an appraisal report from his bag, he handed it to Old Lady Lin, “Mother, calm down and listen to me!”! Actually, from the beginning to the end, we had all misunderstood Ah Shu. Back then, in Yunjing Hospital, a nurse had carried the wrong child. Ah Shu’s and my child had been carried by the MU family for eighteen years, while Ah Shu’s child was the Mu family’s. It was only in July last year that the lives of the two children had finally returned to normal! Thus, the Ye Yourong we saw in April was not ah Shu and I’s child at all. Only Ye Zao was my daughter, Ah Ze’s biological sister, and also your biological granddaughter... ... .. ”

Old Lady Lin held the appraisal report and was stunned.

Feng Qianhua was also stunned.

“She had never imagined that Lin Jincheng would not only recover his memories, but also find ye Shu and resolve this misunderstanding. ”

How could this be?

How could this be?

“Ye Shu came back, then what about her? ”
