“At this point, Zhao Xueyin’s eyes were filled with disappointment. She looked at si lui and said, “Big Brother Si, I originally thought that we had a tacit understanding. No matter what I do, you will support me unconditionally.” ”

“Now it seems that I’m thinking too much.”

The corners of Zhao Xueyin’s mouth were filled with a self-deprecating smile.

After hearing these words.

Si Lui’s heart was about to break.

It was his fault.

He had misunderstood Zhao Xueyin.

Si lui was very regretful now.

He regretted why he had said those words in support of ye Zao just now.

He should not have supported ye Zao.

He should not have made Zhao Xueyin Sad and sad.

“But now, it was useless to regret. ”

“Zhao Xueyin continued, “Actually, it’s not strange that you would stand on Ye Zao’s side. I should have thought of it long ago. Ye Zao is so outstanding and so good-looking. If it were me, I would have made the same choice as you guys.” ”

You guys?

Why you guys?

Could it be that other than him...

Was there anyone else?

“Si lui was very puzzled, but at this moment, he could not care about that anymore, he quickly explained, “It’s not like that! Xueyin, you’ve misunderstood me! I’m not standing on Ye Zhuo’s side. I was muddle-headed in the morning! I’m sorry, I apologize to you...” ” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Zhao Xueyin interrupted the lawyer, “Brother Si, you can go out first! I’m a little tired!” ”

“Xueyin!”The lawyer didn’t want to go out.

“”Annie, send chairman si out.”Zhao Xueyin’s back was facing the lawyer. She held back her tears and her voice was trembling. ”

“Annie walked to the lawyer’s side, “Chairman si, Miss Zhao has already encountered enough trouble today. Please let her calm down.” ”

The lawyer had no choice but to follow Annie’s footsteps.

“Outside, the lawyer looked at Annie. “What exactly happened?” ”

“Annie looked at the lawyer. “You, you shouldn’t ask.” ”

“Speak.”

“Annie hesitated for a moment before saying, “Miss Jiang came in the morning.” ”

“Jiang Xiaoyu?”

Annie nodded.

“Jiang Xiaoyu bullied Xueyin?”The lawyer asked.

“”Not really.”Annie shook her head, then, she said, “Miss Jiang was the same as you. Because of President Ye’s matter, she had a dispute with Miss Zhao. In the end, because of president ye breaking up with Miss Zhao, she said something ruthless about severing ties.” ”

The lawyer did not expect things to turn out this way.

No Wonder Zhao Xueyin would say something like that back in the office.

The ‘You’Zhao Xueyin was referring to was him and Jiang Xiaoyu.

Jiang Xiaoyu and Zhao Xueyin were good friends for many years.

Why did Jiang Xiaoyu break up with Zhao Xueyin.

Moreover.

“At this moment, the lawyer suddenly remembered something. ”

“If she remembered correctly, the person who was trapped in the elevator last night was also Old Madam Jiang. ”

Could it be that Jiang Xiaoyu broke up with Zhao Xueyin because of this.

He also had a good impression of ye Zhuo because of the elevator incident.

Could it be that...

The elevator incident was not a coincidence?

“The lawyer furrowed his brows tightly, but no expression could be seen on his face. ”

“Annie continued, “Initially, Miss Zhao’s mood was already very bad because of Miss Jiang’s matter. I didn’t expect you to... sigh...”at the end of her sentence, Annie sighed deeply. ”

“The lawyer was feeling very guilty. His face was filled with guilt. “I, I didn’t know...” ”

“If he had known earlier, he would not have supported ye Zhuo in the meeting. ”

“Annie sighed and continued, “Now that the matter has already happened, it’s useless to say anything! Chairman si, now not only Miss Zhao is very disappointed in you, I’m also very disappointed in You!” ”

The lawyer did not say anything.

Annie did not say anything more. She looked at the lawyer and turned to leave.

On the other side.

“After sister-in-law Wang brought the prescription back, she used the rest time the next morning to go with her daughter to buy the Chinese medicine on the prescription. According to the instructions on the prescription, she began to brew the medicine in the kitchen. ”

Chinese medicine was different from Western medicine.

“At this time, the room with two bedrooms and one living room was filled with the strong smell of medicine. ”

“”What are you two doing in the kitchen? Why is there such a strong smell?”Her husband, Su Qiang, walked in from the living room. ”

“Su Xiaoqing smiled and said, “My mother is brewing the medicine for you!” ”

“What medicine?”Su Qiang asked.

“”The medicine to treat diabetes.”Wang Sao smiled and said, “I brought this prescription back from the Zhou family! The Zhou family is a big family. It’s said that president ye of the Shunxi Financial Group wrote this prescription! “I believe that this prescription will definitely cure your disease!” ”

“Whether it was the Zhou family or president ye of the Shunxi Financial Group, they were both existences that ordinary people could only dream of. ”
