Translator: 549690339

Duanmu Fengfei was dumbfounded.

What was Cen Haifeng talking about?

He said that Zhou Xiang was his wife.

What was going on?

Wasn’t Cen Haifeng’s forbidden technique strengthened?

How did he remember Zhou Xiang?

Auditory hallucination!

It must be auditory hallucination!

“Duanmu Fengfei tried his best to hold back the panic in his heart and looked at Cen Haifeng. “Haifeng, what are you talking about? What Zhou Xiang? I. . . I don’t know...” ”

“”You don’t Know?”Cen Haifeng sneered. “Duanmu Fengfei, how can you not know?” ”

“”I really don’t know!”Duanmu fengfei continued, “Haifeng! I’m your only wife! I don’t know that Zhou Xiang!” ”

“At this point, Duanmu Fengfei paused and suddenly thought of something. “Haifeng, Haifeng, you must have had a nightmare, right? The dreams are fake. There is no Zhou Xiang at all...” ”

“Cen Haifeng looked at duanmu huangfei and said, “I remember everything.” ”

His very calm words made Duanmu Huangfei’s spine break out in a cold sweat and his entire body trembled.

How could it be?

It couldn’t be.

“Duanmu Huangfei clenched his fists. Because he had used too much strength, his knuckles had turned slightly white. ”

“CEN Haifeng continued, “I remember that my name is Cen Haifeng. I’m from Earth and my wife’s name is Zhou Xiang. We have four daughters, one daughter is Cen Yuying, the second daughter is Cen Yueya, the third daughter is Cen Yueying, the fourth daughter is Cen Yuyan, and the youngest son is Cen Shaoqing.” ”

“Yes, Cen Haifeng remembered everything. He felt that he had let down Zhou Xiang, his mother, and the children. ”

“At the time of his accident, the eldest daughter was twenty-one years old, and the youngest daughter and Cen Shaoqing were still underage. ”

“So many years had passed, and the four daughters were probably already married and had children. ”

“However, as a father, he did not personally hand his daughter’s hand to his son-in-law. He missed the most important part in the growth of his children. ”

And his mother.

“Three days before the shipwreck, he had just celebrated the 72nd birthday of Old Mrs. Cen. Now, Old Mrs. Cen was already 92 years old. After so many years, he did not know if his mother was still alive. ”

He remembered that his mother suffered from a very serious head disease. She often could not sleep through the night.

The person he felt the most sorry for was Zhou Xiang.

“He and Zhou Xiang were in a free relationship. The two of them loved each other deeply. Based on his understanding of Zhou Xiang, after so many years, Zhou Xiang definitely did not remarry. ”

Cen Haifeng was in great pain when he thought of this.

Duanmu fenghuang was really panicking when she saw Cen Haifeng Like This.

Why?

Why did Cen Haifeng suddenly think of this?

Could it be that the great elder and the National Advisor did this?

“But they clearly said that they wanted to strengthen the forbidden technique on Cen Hai Feng’s body. Logically speaking, Cen Hai Feng should have forgotten everything. Why did Cen Hai suddenly think of this? ”

What should they do now?

Cen Hai Feng had remembered everything now. Would she still have a position in the alliance in the future?

No. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

She had to stabilize the situation.

“No! You’re not from Earth!”Duanmu Huang Fei looked at Cen Hai Feng. “All of this is your imagination!”

“At this point, Duanmu Huangfei’s voice changed and he continued, “Haifeng, I’ve been married to you for 20 years. Over the years, I’ve given you everything and even lost my fertility. Have you forgotten about it?” ”

“You know very well whether it’s a fantasy or not.”Cen Haifeng’s face was full of anger.

He had never thought that the world he lived in was constructed with lies.

Everyone was lying to him!

“He had a wife and children, but they said that his parents had passed away a long time ago. ”

“In the ancestral hall of the headquarters, there was a memorial tablet for his parents. ”

Only now did he know.

That his father was really his father.

As for his mother...

Duanmu Tianxiang was not worthy of being his mother!

His mother’s name was Bai Tang.

All of this was a ploy by the headquarters.

“The General Alliance of the General Alliance had to be born, grow up, get married, and have children on Earth. ”

“After getting married and having children, the General Alliance would bring him back and use a forbidden spell to make him forget everything on Earth and remarry and start a family. ”

“The families on Earth would not only have to suffer the pain of life and death, but they would also have to bear the responsibility of raising the next General Alliance. ”

“After the children got married and had children, they would be brought back to the General Alliance. The wounds that their families had painstakingly healed would be torn apart at this moment..! ... and so on and so forth! ”

This method was simply malicious to himself.

“Cen Haifeng’s hands were clenched into fists, and the veins on the back of his hands bulged out. He looked somewhat terrifying. ”
