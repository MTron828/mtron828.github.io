“Si Lui didn’t expect Ming Yao to be so direct. However, it was good that she was so direct. It saved him a lot of trouble. ”

“”What About You? If the full score is 100, how many points do you give me?” ”

“”60 points.”Ming Yao said, “Because my understanding of you is based on hearsay. However, from your appearance, you shouldn’t be a bad person.” ”

“”I didn’t expect Miss Ming to know how to read people’s faces.”Si lui chuckled. “In other words, I passed?” ”

Ming Yao nodded. “You can say that.”

“Then.., ming Yao continued, “I’m a straightforward person and I don’t like to beat around the bush. Since both our parents want us to be together, I think we can give it a try. At most, we can play our own games after marriage and complement each other.” ”

“After saying that, Ming Yao raised her head and looked at the lawyer. ”

The lawyer didn’t say anything and tried to figure out what he was hesitating about.

“Ming Yao continued, “It’s fine as long as it’s fine. If it’s not fine, it’s not fine. Don’t worry, I’m not the kind of person who pesters you.” ”

“Just when Ming Yao thought that the lawyer would reject her, the lawyer suddenly extended his hand to her. “Happy working with you.” ”

Ming Yao smiled and held the lawyer’s hand. “Happy working with you.”

Zhao Xueyin felt much better after coming out of the bathroom again.

“Wen Si Lan was worried about Zhao Xueyin and waited at the bathroom door. When she saw Zhao Xueyin come out, she immediately went up to her. “How is it? Xueyin, are you okay?” ”

“I’m fine.”Zhao Xueyin smiled and said.

“It’s good that you’re fine.”Wen Si Lan held Zhao Xueyin’s hand. “Let’s go quickly! He’s already dancing in the front hall.”

“Okay.”Zhao Xueyin nodded.

“When the two of them walked into the banquet hall, they saw Si lui and Ming Yao dancing in the opening dance. ”

Their skin was touching and their posture was intimate. Zhao Xueyin’s heart was burning with anger.

Si lui was hers.

What right did Ming Yao have?

Shameless.

She was simply shameless to the extreme.

“Such a person, and she was even the eldest daughter of an aristocratic family! ”

“Seeing Zhao Xueyin looking in that direction, Wen Si Lan blinked her eyes unwillingly and continued, “How is it? Xueyin, do you also think that the two of them are a good match?” ”

“Yes.”Zhao Xueyin nodded and continued walking forward.

“Wen Si Lan pulled Zhao Xueyin back. “Xueyin, what are you going to do?” ”

“Zhao Xueyin said, “I’m going to say hello to Jin Ruyu.” ”

Since the lawyer didn’t see her.

Then she would go and look for the lawyer.

She would go and look for the lawyer personally.

“If she put down her airs and went to look for the lawyer personally, the lawyer would definitely be very happy. ”

“When that time came, what would Ming Yao Be? ”

Ming Yao could only be her foil!

“Thinking of this, Zhao Xueyin’s face was full of joy. ”

“You Know Him?”Wen Si Lan’s eyes were full of disbelief.

“Zhao Xueyin nodded and said modestly, “We have a little friendship.” ”

“Then why didn’t you say it just now?”Wen Si Lan’s tone carried some blame. “I thought you two didn’t know each other!”

“Zhao Xueyin turned to look at Wen Si Lan. “Actually, I only just recognized her. I thought I was mistaken just now.” ”

“”So that’s how it is!”Wen Si lan continued, “Then, are you familiar with Jin Ruyu?” ”

“”Not bad,”Zhao Xueyin said. ”

Not only that.

The lawyer had a crush on her for many years.

He had proposed to her before.

“While they were talking, Zhao Xueyin had already walked up to the lawyer and said softly, “Big Brother Si.” ”

“Seeing this scene, everyone started whispering and discussing among themselves, trying to guess who Zhao Xueyin was. ”

“Who is that woman?”

“I think it’s Zhao Xueyin.”

“Zhao Xueyin? The one who seduced master five and was thrown out by master five from the DK Jewelry Center?”

“”Yes, it’s her!” ”

“”TSK, this kind of woman is really shameless! She was just thrown out by master five and now she’s seducing Jin Ruyu!” ”

Seduce?

She needed to seduce the lawyer?

“It was clearly the lawyer who had a crush on her, and he had no choice but to do it for her. Even if he wanted to die, he would still cling to her! ”

Just wait and see.

“Soon, the lawyer’s actions would smack all of their faces. ”

The lawyer would tell them who was the one who would cling to her!

“After Zhao Xueyin finished her sentence, the lawyer’s reaction was somewhat different from what she had imagined. ”

“Logically speaking, the lawyer should have been so excited that he should have burst into tears. ”

But the lawyer was too calm.

So calm that it made people panic.

Could it be that the lawyer was too excited that he was so calm?

Yes.

That must be the case.

“Otherwise, how could the lawyer’s reaction be so calm. ”

She was the person that the lawyer placed at the top of his heart.

“In front of her, Ming Yao was nothing? ”

Ming Yao was not even a lump of mud.

Zhao Xue Yin narrowed her eyes.

“Ming Yao looked curiously at the lawyer. “Miss, is this your friend?” ”
