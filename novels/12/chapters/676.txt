Could it be that her mother was worse than a crazy woman?

“After a while, the car arrived at the Lin family manor.”

Lin Jincheng and ye Shu stood at the door waiting for them.

“Seeing the couple, although Old Lady Lin felt a little uncomfortable, she still suppressed all her unhappiness.”

“”Jin Cheng, Ah Shu.”Old Mrs. Lin smiled. “Why didn’t I see Ah Ze and burning?””

“Lin Jin Cheng said, “They went to school.””

Old Mrs. Lin nodded.

“”Mom, how is your body? What did the Doctor Say?”Lin Jin Cheng continued to ask.”

He finally asked about her body condition!

“Old Mrs. Lin heaved a sigh of relief and continued, “That ingrate poisoned me for more than ten years. The Doctor said that I can only try to use Chinese medicine to detoxify the poison now. It’s best if it can be detoxified. If it can’t be detoxified... then it’s my life.””

“At the end of her sentence, Old Madam Lin Sighed.”

“Lin Jincheng continued, “Then in the following days, you should take your medicine and recuperate your body. I believe that the poison in your body can definitely be expelled.””

“Hearing this, the hope on old Madam Lin’s face instantly disappeared.”

She had thought that Lin Jincheng would ask ye Zhuo to come and take a look at her.

“After all, Ye Zao’s medical skills were indeed good.”

She did not think that Lin Jincheng would not even mention it.

Was this the son that she had raised for more than thirty years?

He could even leave his biological mother to die!

“Old Madam Lin took a deep breath and continued, “Alright, you all can go back. I want to calm down by myself.””

Lin Jincheng nodded and held ye Shu’s hand. “Then Ah Shu and I will go back first.”

“Lin Qingxuan also said, “Mom, I’ll go first too.””

The three of them turned around and left.

Old Madam Lin looked at the backs of the three of them and felt very wronged.

“No matter what, she was also a victim of this matter. Why couldn’t her biological son and daughter-in-law understand her?”

She was now terminally ill and no one cared about her.

“Her biological granddaughter was obviously a doctor, but ye Zao chose to sit on the sidelines.”

...

The weather was getting colder.

The new year was getting closer and closer.

“After ye Zao finished his last class and was about to return to the dormitory, Li Yueyue rushed in excitedly from outside the classroom. “Big Zao! It’s snowing outside!””

“Really?”Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“In the world that ye Zao lived in in his previous life, the global climate was warming, so snow could only be seen on television.”

“Although he had already seen snow once when he came to Beijing last year, Ye Zao was still very happy to hear that it was snowing. He went outside the classroom with Li Yueyue. He did not know when the snow had fallen, at this time, a thin layer of snow had already accumulated on the ground.”

“It was the first time many students from the south had seen snow. At this moment, they were as excited as a husky, throwing themselves in the snow.”

“Li Yueyue stretched out her hand and caught a piece of snow. She said in surprise, “The snow in the capital is actually different from the snow in our place!””

“How is it different?”Ye Zao went over curiously.

“Li Yueyue continued, “Look, the snow in the capital has no shape. If you look carefully at the snow in our grassland, you will find that it is hexagonal! Just like the snow in the textbooks.””

“Ye Zao had never seen a hexagonal snowflake before, so he was puzzled, “Really?””

“”Of course it’s true!”Li Yueyue took out her phone, “It started snowing in October at our place. Look at this photo I took last year. Do you think this snowflake is different from the one in the capital city?””

“The phone screen showed a magnified picture of a snowflake. Ye Zao said in surprise, “It’s really different.””

“Li Yueyue said proudly, “Of course it’s different. How can I Lie to You? The snow at our place is much better looking than the snow in the capital city! Big Zao Zao, if you have time, you must go to our prairie to play! I promise to refresh yours.””

“Okay!”Ye Zao nodded.

“Li Yueyue put away the phone and continued, “Zao Zao, do you have frostbite?””

“No.”Ye Zhuozhuo shook his head.

“Li Yueyue said, “That’s such a pity. If you have frostbite, I can share a very effective folk prescription with you. I guarantee that after you use this folk prescription, you won’t have frostbite anymore!””

“”I have frostbite every year! Yueyue, tell me about this folk prescription!”A short-haired girl came over and said.”

This short-haired girl was also from the chemistry department. Her name was Milo. She usually played well with Li Yueyue and Ye Zhuo.

“Li Yueyue looked at Milo, “This folk prescription is known by all the herdsmen in our area. Although it is a little shocking, the effect is really good! “I also loved frostbite when I was young. After I used that folk prescription, I never got frostbite again! The children of our herdsmen grew up with this prescription!””
