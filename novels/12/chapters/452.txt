“Okay!”

“Lin Ze’s eyes lit up. This safe was manufactured in Thailand. Since the other party was a password cracking expert in Thailand, he must have a way to crack the password! ”

“After hanging up the phone, Lin Ze quickly logged into his account and entered the room. ”

The expert was sitting across from him.

“After Lin Ze greeted him, he sent the picture and website address of the safe to him. ”

“About five minutes later, the expert looked up at Lin Ze, he said with a face full of regret, “I’m sorry. This safe is a custom-made one. It’s also the latest model on the market. There are hundreds of programs in it. It combines face recognition and voice recognition. If you forcefully decipher it, it will immediately trigger the alarm button.” ”

“”So, you can’t decipher it either?” ”

“The expert shook his head. “I’m sorry, I can’t.” ”

“If the safe could be deciphered so quickly, it wouldn’t be called a safe anymore. “I hope that we can work together again next time.” ”

“With that, the expert went offline. ”

“It was originally a three-person room, but it had suddenly become two people. ”

Lin Ze’s expression was a little absent-minded.

“Seeing him like this, the person across from him said, “Brother Ze, don’t be anxious. I know a person. He definitely has a way to decipher it.” ”

“Who?”Lin Ze raised his head.

“The hacker world’s z God!”

“Lin Ze narrowed his eyes. “Twirl, do you know Z God?” ”

“As a well-known big shot in the hacker world, Lin Ze naturally knew about Z god. ”

“However, Z God was too mysterious. He had only heard of him and had never seen him before. ” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“”Although I don’t know z God, my cousin knows him. My cousin is the famous W! He seems to be on good terms with Z God. I heard that Z God is quite nice and doesn’t put on any airs! “Moreover, Z God just won the first prize in the hacker world this year. His professional skills directly crushed country P and country T! “As long as he makes a move, he will definitely be able to crack this broken safe!” ”

“Lin Ze obviously knew what Z God was capable of. “Xiao Dan, then I’ll leave it to you. You must help me contact Z God.” ”

“”Brother Ze, wait for my news.” ”

Lin Ze nodded.

...

At the CEN residence.

Cen Shaoqing hung up the phone and went downstairs.

“Cen Yueya was sitting on the sofa chatting with Cen Yueying and her eldest sister, Cen Yuying. ”

“It was said that three women acted in a show, and this was not a lie. The three of them were chatting so enthusiastically that they did not even notice that Cen Shaoqing had arrived. ”

“Cen Shaoqing coughed lightly and opened his thin lips. “Eldest sister, second sister, and third sister.” ”

The three of them did not react at all.

Cen Shaoqing called out again.

The three of them still did not react.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “My girlfriend will come over tomorrow.” ”

“This sentence seemed to have hit the pause button in the air, and the voices immediately stopped. The three of them looked up at Cen Shaoqing. “Really?” ”

“”Shaoqing, are you kidding us?” ”

“Previously, the few of them had talked about this matter in front of Cen Shaoqing many times, but Cen Shaoqing had always been evasive. ”

How could he bring it home now?

It felt a little surreal.

“Cen Shaoqing repeated it again. “Yes, my girlfriend is coming over tomorrow.” ”

“Old Madam Cen happened to pass by the living room. When she heard this, she was so excited that even her slippers flew away. “Rascal, what did you say? My precious granddaughter-in-law is coming over tomorrow?” ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“”That’s great! I haven’t seen Yezi for almost a month!” Old Mrs. Cen turned to look at the three Cen sisters, “Eldest girl, second girl, third girl, you must be careful tomorrow. Don’t scare my granddaughter-in-law! Especially your second girl! You must be careful!” ”

“Cen Yueya hugged old Mrs. Cen’s arm. “Don’t worry, Grandma, I know!” ”

Old Mrs. Cen looked at Cen Yuying. “Tell the fourth girl to come back early tomorrow.”

Cen Yuying nodded.

“Because ye Zhuo was coming tomorrow, Old Mrs. Cen went to the kitchen to order more desserts. Then she went to the purchasing department to send more fresh fruits back by air. ”

“After Old Mrs. Cen left, CEN yueying asked curiously, “Didn’t the military training just end? Big Sister, second sister, do you think sister-in-law is very tanned?” ”

“CEN yueya nodded, “When I was in the military training back then, my face was so tanned that a layer of skin peeled off. Sister-in-law would definitely not be any better! You still dare to come to our house to meet the parents at this time. Sister-in-law is really brave!” ”

That was military training!

A full fifteen days!

“The weather in the capital was already hot. It was already the eighth month of the lunar calendar, and the temperature was still over thirty degrees. ”
