“When did you come?”Cen Shaoqing walked over and stood behind ye Zao.

“”About half an hour,”ye Zao answered without raising his head. ”

“Cen Shaoqing stared at the screen for about a minute. Seeing that ye Zao still had no reaction, Cen Shaoqing leaned slightly and rested his chin on ye Zao’s shoulder. One hand landed on her waist, and the other on the keyboard, a faint fragrance instantly filled his nostrils. “Is the game that fun?” ”

He did not even look at him.

“That…”ye Zao looked back slightly. “I’m live streaming.”

Cen Shaoqing was stunned for a second and let go of Ye Zao. “I’ll wait for you at the side.”

“At this moment, the bullet comments exploded. ”

[ oh my God! was that ye Zao’s boyfriend Just Now? ]

“”Although I didn’t see his face, his voice was so magnetic and beautiful! He must be a handsome man!” ”

“”Ah Ah Ah! I’m so excited, I actually heard Yezi’s boyfriend’s voice! Yezi, when will you let us meet him in person!” ”

“”And that hand is also very good-looking. The joints are long, beautiful and well-proportioned! I heard that a man with long fingers has another place that is especially long!” ”

“This is not the bus to the kindergarten. I want to get off!”

“Is what you said above true? I want to find my boyfriend to test it out!”

“I also want to know if it’s true!”

“Hence, the bullet comments were completely slanted. ”

“Ye Zao was a little embarrassed. Fortunately, he did not let Cen Shaoqing see these bullet comments. Otherwise, he would not be able to explain. ”

“After the live broadcast of a game, ye Zao logged off. ”

“Cen Shaoqing was sitting on the sofa, processing documents. His long legs were crossed, inadvertently emitting a strong aura. Holding the documents in his right hand, ye Zao’s gaze fell on his well-defined hand. ” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

His skin was the kind of white with a cold color.

His fingers were very long.

Playing the piano would definitely look good.

“Ye Zao suddenly remembered the words on the bullet screen. His gaze turned hot, and he immediately averted his gaze. ”

“He silently recited the words, meaning that it was empty. He walked to the fridge and picked up a bottle of ice-cold coke. ”

“As the ice-cold Coke entered his stomach, the messy thoughts in his heart faded a little. ”

“You’re done?”A deep male voice suddenly appeared in the air.

Ye Zao was stunned. He saw that the man who was originally sitting there processing documents had appeared in front of him at some point in time.

“Okay.”Ye Zao’s face was still abnormally red.

“What’s wrong with your face?”

Ye Zao touched his face. “Nothing. It’s probably too hot.”

Cen Shaoqing took out his phone to adjust the temperature of the air conditioner. “Can you do it now?”

“Almost.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

…

The Lin family.

Madam Lin had been preparing for Lin Jin City and Feng Qianhua’s engagement party these few days. The Lin family was very busy.

“As soon as Lin Ze got out of the car, he felt that something was wrong. “Grandpa Butler, did something happen at home?” ”

The Butler hesitated and didn’t know what to say.

He had watched Lin ze grow up.

He knew that Lin Ze didn’t like Feng Qianhua and her daughter.

“But now, Mrs. Lin had made up her mind, and Lin Jincheng didn’t refuse. Even Lin Ze wouldn’t be able to stop this. ”

“”Grandpa Butler, is there anything that you can’t Let Me Know?”Lin Ze asked. ”

“The Butler carefully chose his words and continued, “Young master, didn’t Old Mrs. Lin tell you? The master is going to get engaged to Miss Feng. We’ve been preparing the engagement party for the master and Miss Feng these days.” ”

“What?”Lin Ze’s face turned pale.

The Butler repeated what he had just said.

“”Grandpa Butler, are you kidding me?”Lin Ze frowned. “How could my father be engaged to Aunt Feng?” ”

“This is absolutely true.”The Butler sighed. “Just accept reality.”

“Impossible!”Lin Ze’s voice suddenly became louder. “My father would never marry Aunt Feng! He hasn’t found my mother yet! How could he marry someone else?”

The housekeeper was in a difficult position and didn’t know how to answer Lin Ze.

“Qianhua will be your mother from now on!”Old Mrs. Lin’s voice came from behind. “Xianxian will be your sister.”

Lin Ze turned to look at Old Mrs. Lin. “No! I don’t agree!”

“Old Mrs. Lin’s face was cold, she berated, “You don’t have the right to disagree! I have already set the date. It will be on the 18th of this month. From now on, your Aunt Feng will be your father’s fiancée and your future mother! I will let them get married this year!” ”

Old Mrs. Lin’s words were extremely forceful.
