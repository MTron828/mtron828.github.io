Chapter 826: 180: take a sip of Coke to calm down. It’s the same Little Red Mole! 6

It’s all her fault.

“Thinking of this, Old Lady Lin wiped her tears.”

“After a while, Old Lady Lin looked up at Lin Qingxuan again, “Qingxuan, I’m even more sorry to you. I’ve caused you trouble for most of your life... In the past, it was all my fault. I shouldn’t have been obsessed, and I shouldn’t have cut ties with you. I was too ruthless.””

“Thinking about the past, Old Madam Lin was so regretful that her intestines turned green.”

“If she could, she really wanted to do it all over again.”

Unfortunately.

The life she had missed could not be repeated at all.

“Lin Qingxuan walked to Old Madam Lin’s side and sighed deeply. “Mom, let bygones be bygones.””

“Qingxuan!”Old Madam Lin hugged Lin Qingxuan and cried loudly.

“After so many days, she finally found a vent.”

She had always been worried that Lin Qingxuan would not forgive her.

“At this moment, when she heard Lin Qingxuan call her ‘mom,’she put everything down.”

“Even if she died, she would have no regrets.”

...

At the CEN residence.

At the dining table.

“Old Madam Cen looked at Cen Shaoqing. “It’s been a long time since I’ve seen Yezi. I miss her a lot. You Little Brat, what do you mean by bringing Yezi back to play?””

“Cen Shaoqing picked up a piece of green vegetable. “Don’t you have a cell phone? If you miss her, you can video chat with her.””

“Video chat is different from real life.”Old Mrs. Cen rolled her eyes at Cen Shaoqing. “Didn’t you already start eating meat? Why are you still eating grass all day long?”

“I’m used to it.”Cen Shaoqing’s tone was indifferent.

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Tomorrow is Saturday. Bring Yezi home tomorrow.””

“That depends on whether she has the time.”

“Old Mrs. Cen raised her head proudly. “As long as you tell Yezi that I miss her, she will definitely come!””

Cen Yuyan listened by the side with a slightly unpleasant feeling.

This old Mrs. Cen was really muddle-headed. She never left ye Zhuo’s side.

“If people who did not know saw it, they would think that ye Zhuo was her biological granddaughter!”

“At that time, Cen Shaoqing didn’t like Ye Zao at all, and it was old Madam Cen who insisted on intervening.”

Did she really think that she was the Moon Elder?

“If it wasn’t for her old age, who would be willing to pay attention to her?”

“After Cen Shaoqing left, Cen Yuyan looked at Old Madam Cen. “Grandma.””

“”What’s Wrong?”Old Madam Cen glanced at Cen Yuyan. “If you have something to say, hurry up and say it!””

“Cen Yuyan frowned. “Grandma, How Do You Speak?”” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“”That’s how I speak! If you’re not willing to listen, then get lost!””

“Cen Yuyan tried her best to suppress the anger in her heart and continued, “Grandma, I feel that scorching doesn’t treat me as her sister at all. Look, her wechat moments are all blocked from me.””

Old Mrs. Cen glanced at Cen Yuyan. “Don’t you realize that my moments are also blocked from you?”

Cen Yuyan was stunned.

“”I can’t even be bothered to scold you now!”Old Mrs. Cen pointed at CEN Yuyan and said, “Why are we so tacitly blocking you? Don’t you have a point in the middle of AC in your heart? Even that old fool of the Lin family has come to his senses. You’re still a young man. Why are you worse than an old lady in her eighties?””

Cen Yuyan was really too angry.

She didn’t expect Old Lady Cen to say this to her.

“She was trying to reason with Old Lady Cen, but Old Lady Cen didn’t even try to reason with her.”

“I’m just saying it to you. Is there a need for you to be so agitated? I didn’t say anything bad about burning!”

“Old Lady Cen glared at Cen Yuyan. “Sun, you immortal board!””

“After saying this, she left in a huff.”

Immortal Board?

Cen Yuyan didn’t understand what this sentence meant.

“Just then, Zhou Xiang walked over. Cen Yuyan asked, “Mom, what does the immortal board mean?””

Zhou Xiang scratched his head. “Who told you this sentence?”

“Grandma.”

Zhou Xiang thought for a moment. “It should mean that fairies are flying all over the place.”

“OH.”Cen Yuyan nodded.

...

Lin family.

Ye Zhuo sat in front of his desk with a brush in his hand. He was focused on drawing something.

“He started to draw, and the ink on the white paper turned into a river.”

“In a short while, a perfect landscape painting appeared on the rice paper.”

Ding —

“At this moment, his phone rang.”

Ye Zhuo put down the brush and turned on his phone. He was focused on replying to the person’s message.

“After replying to the message, Ye Zhuo turned on the live streaming platform and started streaming.”

“She had not been streaming for a week. When her fans saw that she was online, they were all extremely excited.”

[ Ah Ah Ah! Ye Zi is back! ]

“[ ye Zi, long time no see. ]”

“[ ye Zi, I miss you so much. ]”

[ heaven and earth collapse Purple Gold Hammer 1225: send out ten sports cars! ]

[ that dog: give out 10 cloud piercing arrows! ]

“”Good evening, everyone. Let’s play a game of chess today, and then we’ll play some pesticide.””

“[ actually, I feel that Leaf’s voice is also very good. Why don’t Leaf Sing Us a song? ]”

[ add one! ]

Ye Zhuo pretended not to see the bullet screen and opened the chess APP.

Liang Ying was a loyal fan of ye Zao. She was lying on her bed watching ye Zao’s live stream.

“At this moment, a man in a white bathrobe walked out of the bathroom. “What are you watching?””

“I’m watching a live stream of chess.”Liang Ying turned around.

The man sat on the bed and hugged Liang Ying in his arms. “What Kind of streamer is this? Why Can’t I See Her Face?”

“Don’t look at how she doesn’t show her face. This person is very good at chess.”

“The man’s gaze fell on the pair of hands on the screen, and he frowned slightly.”

Those hands.

Why were they so familiar?

“They were extremely similar to ye Langhua’s hands when she was young, especially the little red mole behind her little finger.”

They were simply... exactly the same.
