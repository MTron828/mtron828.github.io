Chapter 115: 078: an unknown past! Brother Ze, your birth mother might be in cloud capital! 1

Hearing this, song Shiyu turned back to look at Mu Yourong.

The expression in his eyes was faint, containing some probing.

Being looked at like this by song Shiyu, Mu Yourong felt that she had returned to her previous life. In that Stinky Beast Cage, Song Shiyu looked down at her from above. He clearly had an imposing air of nobility, and strangers were like Jade.., but he was like a demon that had crawled out of Hell.

Sinister to the point of being terrifying!

He could take her life at any time.

A layer of cold sweat appeared on Mu Yourong’s forehead, but she had no choice but to pretend to be calm. She spoke again, “Mr. Song, I Am Mr. Yang’s Savior. The person he is looking for is me.”

Song Shiyu habitually turned the thumb ring on his thumb. “Miss Mu’s surname is Ye?”

“Before I was eighteen, my surname was Ye,”Mu Yourong explained.

Before I was eighteen, my surname was Ye?

Song Shiyu nodded slightly. “Then Miss Mu, come with me.”

Mu Yourong bore the immense pressure and followed song Shiyu’s footsteps.

Seeing that he had nothing else to do, Ye Zhuo picked up the half-eaten cherry cake and continued eating.

The song family manor was very large.

As the front hall was receiving guests, it was not convenient to meet people, so grandfather Yang was waiting for them in the inner hall of the backyard.

Grandfather Yang and the song family were old friends, and he was also very familiar with the song family’s old lady. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

At this time, grandfather Yang was chatting with the song family’s old lady in the front hall.

The song family’s old lady was a very kind old lady.

She was already 78 years old this year.

Because she had a serious illness when she was young, she looked a little older than her actual age. Fortunately, she was still in good spirits.

“I’m really happy to see that you’re fine. Yun Ying will be very happy underground too.”After saying that, old lady song sighed, then, she said, “When we reach our age, we’ll see less of each other in the future.”

One of them was 78, while the other was 75.

Even if they could live for a hundred years, it would be less than 30 years.

But could they really live for a hundred years?

How many centenarians were there in this world?

Such a topic could not help but be a little sad.

Grandfather Yang sighed.

Old Madam song continued, “I heard that the godly doctor who cured you was especially young, and she was even a girl?”

Old Master Yang nodded. “Yes, even though Little Miracle Doctor Ye is young, his abilities are not small at all. My life was picked up from Little Miracle Doctor Ye’s hands.”

Old Master Yang was already prepared to die. He had even prepared a suicide note. He did not think that he would still be able to survive.

Hearing this, Old Madam Song’s eyes were filled with curiosity.

What exactly did that little girl look like.

It was said that when God opened a door for you, he would close a window for you.

That little girl should not be very good-looking.

Otherwise, her medical skills would not be so exquisite.

“Elder Yang, Miss Mu is here.”

Song Shiyu’s voice interrupted the conversation between the two elders.

Hearing this, grandfather Yang’s eyes lit up.

Then, he felt that something was not right. “Miss Mu? Shiyu, you’re mistaken. The person I’m Looking For is Little Miracle Doctor Ye. Little Miracle Doctor Ye’s surname is Ye!”

Song Shiyu explained, “That miss mu said that her surname was ye before she was eighteen.”

Grandfather Yang nodded slightly. “I see. Then where is Little Miracle Doctor Ye Now?”

“He’s outside.”

“Quickly invite him in.”Grandfather Yang quickly stood up.

Song Shiyu nodded slightly and turned around to walk outside.

Grandfather Yang also followed.

Old Madam song was curious about what the Divine Doctor Old Master Yang mentioned looked like, so she also followed him out.

Mu Yourong stood outside. When she saw them come out of the room, she was extremely excited and was prepared to accept old master Yang’s most sincere thanks.

After receiving old master Yang’s thanks, she could upgrade the system.

After the system upgrade, not only could she activate her max-level chess skill, but she could also activate her max-level beauty skill.

At that time, what would ye Zhuo be?

She would be able to crush him in a matter of minutes.

However, Old Master Yang did not seem to have seen her. He looked at song Shiyu and asked curiously, “Shiyu, didn’t you say that Little Miracle Doctor Ye is outside?”

“Old Master Yang, this is Miss Ye.”

Mu Yourong straightened her back and a fitting smile appeared on the corner of her mouth. “Old Master Yang, we meet again.”

Old Madam song looked at Mu Yourong.

She thought to herself.

Her guess was indeed correct.

The little girl in front of her looked to be about eighteen or nineteen years old. Her skin was slightly yellowish and her facial features were very well-defined. However, she was only well-defined and had nothing to do with beauty.

However, it was not simple for her to possess magical medical skills.
