Lin Shasha had been preparing for revision. She had already applied for the college entrance exam in June this year.

“After not seeing her for a year, Lin Shasha felt like a different person. ”

“She had cut off her long hair and changed her style. If it wasn’t for ye Zhuo video chatting with her, she wouldn’t dare to admit it. ”

“Sister Sha Sha!” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Zha Zhuo!”

“The moment they met, the two sisters hugged each other. ”

“Zhou Yuelian teased from the side, “Look at these two sisters. Their relationship is even better than their biological sisters!” ”

Ye Shu nodded. “That’s right.”

“Lin Jinshui was an honest person. She walked over and said, “Yuelian, you accompany the girls and chat. I’ll go buy groceries.” ”

“”You go ahead.”Zhou Yuelian nodded. “You know what to buy, right?” ”

“I know.”Lin Jinshui nodded.

Zhou Yuelian turned to look at Ye Shu. “That husband of yours is really amazing. He just sits there looking at his phone and doesn’t say a word.”

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “He’s such a person. He doesn’t like to talk.” ”

“No matter where Lin Jincheng was, he didn’t like to talk. He just held his phone and could sit there for a day. ”

“Zhou Yuelian continued, “Right, are you guys planning to have another three children?” ”

“Yuelian! What are you talking about? ! How Old Am I? !”Ye Shu’s face was slightly red.

“”Ever since the second child policy was introduced, it’s very common for women to give birth at an advanced age! We already have one in our neighborhood. He’s 48 years old and he’s pregnant! Ah Shu, I’m not joking with you!”Zhou Yuelian’s expression was very serious. ”

“Ye Shu shook his head, “We didn’t think of having three children. Two children are enough!” ”

In the room.

Lin Shasha was a little worried. She was worried that she wouldn’t be able to get into the ideal university.

“Ye Zao comforted her. “Sister Shasha, you have to be calm, just like in your usual exams. As long as you perform normally, with your current level, you will definitely be able to get into N University!” ”

Lin Shasha looked at ye Zao. “Really?”

“Of course it’s true!”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Just then, ye Zao’s phone rang. ”

Ye Zao looked at it and immediately cut it off.

“Lin Sha smiled and said, “Your family member?” ”

Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Lin Sha teased, “You’ve only been here for less than half an hour, how many messages has he sent you? He’s really nervous about you!” ”

This kind of feeling made Lin Sha very envious.

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “When you get into university, you can find one too!” ”

Lin Shasha shook her head. “I haven’t thought about those things for the time being.”

People who had been hurt before would not be able to accept a relationship that easily.

They stayed on the first day of the New Year.

The family of four returned from Yun Capital.

On the seventh day of the New Year.

“Ye Zhuo received a call from Bai Shu. “Zhuo Zhuo, did you forget to promise aunt?” ”

Ye Zhuo was stunned for a moment before he remembered that she had promised the old lady that she would definitely visit her with Cen Shaoqing on the first day of the New Year.

“Bai Shu continued, “You promised aunt that the new year would definitely follow Shaoqing to visit aunt! Shaoqing will be coming to Aunt’s house tomorrow. Are You Coming?” ”

“Ye Zhuo then remembered and said with a smile, “Yes, how can I not come! Aunt, don’t worry. I will definitely come and visit you with Cen Shaoqing Tomorrow.” ”

“”Okay, okay, okay.”Bai Shu said happily, “Oh, Zhuozhuo, then I will wait for you at home!” ”

“”Okay.”Ye Zhuo continued, “Don’t worry, I’ll definitely come.” ”

“On the other side, Ye Zhuo had just hung up on Bai Shu when he received a call from CEN Shaoqing. ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “I just received a call from aunt. What time is the Flight Tomorrow Morning?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing’s voice came from the other end of the phone, “The flight is tomorrow morning at nine o’clock. I’ll be waiting for you at your door at half past six.” ”
