“Fortunately, everything was fine after the rain. ”

A minute later.

The car slowly stopped in front of a single-family apartment.

“Song Chenyu got out of the car and walked a few steps. He turned around and instructed his assistant, “You guys can go back first. You Don’t have to pick me up tonight.” ”

“The assistant said carefully, “Then what about the scenes in the afternoon?” ”

“Song Chenyu was in a good mood today, so he didn’t make things difficult for his assistant. “I’ll talk to the Director.” ”

“Okay.”His assistant nodded.

“Song Chenyu walked all the way to the apartment. Just as he was about to ring the doorbell, the door opened from inside. “Miss Chenyu.” ”

“”Special Assistant Liu, where’s my third brother?”Song Chenyu looked inside. ”

“Special assistant Liu said, “The boss is taking a medicinal bath upstairs.” ”

“Medicinal bath?”Song Chenyu frowned. “What’s wrong with my third brother?”

“Special assistant Liu said, “It’s still the same old problem.” ”

“Song Chenyu nodded. As she walked into the house, she sized up the environment of the apartment. ”

“At this moment, a middle-aged woman and two young girls walked out from inside. ”

“Special Assistant Liu took the initiative to introduce them. “Miss Chenyu, this is Auntie Wu, who is in charge of the boss’s three meals a day. These are Little Zhao and little Wang, who are in charge of cleaning. Auntie Wu, Little Zhao and Little Wang, this is the boss’s sister, Miss Chenyu.” ”

“Auntie Wu said respectfully, “Miss Chenyu.” ”

“Little Zhao and little Wang were young girls who liked to chase after celebrities. They immediately recognized song Chenyu and said happily, “I know you! You’re the Big Star, Song Chenyu!” ”

“As a celebrity, the happiest thing to do was to be recognized by the fans. ”

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “Hello.” ”

The two girls were very excited to see their idol.

Song Chenyu turned to look at special assistant Liu. “I’m going upstairs for a walk.”

Special Assistant Liu made a ‘please’gesture.

“Song Chenyu stepped forward, and special assistant Liu followed behind her to introduce which was song Shiyu’s room and which was the guest room. ”

“Song Chenyu opened song Shiyu’s room and said with a smile, “My third brother is still the same. Apart from the bed, there’s nothing else in the room.” ”

“In fact, Song Chenyu and song Shiyu were not biological siblings. ”

Song Chenyu was an orphan adopted by Old Lady Song. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Although they were not biological siblings, Song Shiyu was closer to this sister than his own sister. ”

Song Chenyu had been working hard in the capital all these years.

“Although it was said that he had no relatives and earned everything by himself, in fact, a lot of resources came from Song Shiyu. ”

“At this moment, song Chenyu’s gaze was attracted by the shiny thing beside the pillow. ”

“What’s That?”

It seemed to be a hair clip on a girl’s head.

Song Chenyu’s eyes lit up.

She had never seen song Shiyu like anyone in her entire life.

“Moreover, song Shiyu had personality disorder and mania. Other than being a little special to her younger sister, he didn’t treat anyone well. ”

“Then, how could song Shiyu have such a thing around him? ”

Could it be that song Shiyu had prepared a gift for her?

“Yes, it must be like that! ”

Song Chenyu walked forward and picked up the hairpin.

It was a very beautiful crystal hairpin.

“Seeing this, special assistant Liu’s eyebrows jumped and he hurriedly said, “Miss Chenyu, the boss usually doesn’t allow anyone to touch this hairpin. Quickly put it down! If the boss sees it, he will definitely be angry!” ”

Angry?

Song Shiyu would be angry with her?

How could that be!

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “Don’t worry! My third brother will not be angry.” ”

“As she said that, song Chenyu put the hair clip on her head and started to look at herself in the mirror. ”

It was a very nice looking hair clip.

The only flaw was that it was a little cheap.

“However, this was the first time song Shiyu bought something for a girl, so it was normal that he didn’t know how to choose it. ”

“Who told you to touch it!”

“Just then, a cold voice suddenly appeared in the air. ”
