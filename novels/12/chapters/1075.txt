“Chapter 1076: 237: a slap in the face, YC’s father is mighty! 1”

“When she thought about the fact that ye Zao’s research team had lost more than 20 researchers and that the aircraft carrier project could not continue, Tang Xue felt extremely happy. ”

She had long disliked ye Zao.

“Unfortunately, Ye Zao’s ability was too high, and she could not shake ye Zao’s position in the base. ”

“Moreover, Ye Zao’s starting point was too high. ”

“She was only 20 years old, but she was already a YC doctor in the science and technology industry. Tang Xue still couldn’t forget the scene of ye Zao being worshipped by a group of big shots at the last foreign science and Technology Exhibition. ”

“As the saying goes, the higher you stand, the more miserable you fall. ”

“Ye Zao put down his arrogant words, saying that he could develop an aircraft carrier. Right now, who knew how many people were waiting to see ye Zao make a fool of himself. ”

“At that time, Ye Zao would become the biggest joke in the science and Technology World! ”

“Seeing that Tang Xue did not speak for a long time, old nie said somewhat uneasily, “Miss Tang, if you feel that it’s difficult, then forget it.”After all, there were twenty researchers. Even if Tang Xue wanted to help, she was afraid that even if she wanted to, she would not be able to. ”

“Tang Xue instantly reacted and said with a smile, “It’s not difficult! It’s not difficult at all!”After saying that, Tang Xue looked at the assistant beside her and said, “Xiao Wei, you and Nie Gong go and calculate the list of researchers!” ”

“Okay.”Xiao Wei nodded.

“Hearing that, old nie was moved and said, “Miss Tang, thank you! I thank you on behalf of everyone!” ”

“Tang Xue said, “Nie Gong, you’re too polite. We’re all from the same base, so it’s normal for us to help each other! Now that you’re in trouble, if I don’t show you anything, that would be too cold.” ”

“Hearing this, old nie bowed to Tang Xue. ”

“At present, all the experiments in the base had already started. If no one was willing to let them join, then they could only wait for the experiment to end before joining the new experimental group. ”

The shortest experiment would only end half a year later.

“Now that Tang Xue was willing to help them, old nie was really touched! ”

Probably no one else in the entire base was willing to help them apart from Tang Xue!

“Thinking of how he had previously rejected Tang Xue, old nie felt extremely ashamed. ”

“Fortunately, Tang Xue wasn’t willing to argue with her. ”

“Tang Xue smiled as she helped old nie up. “Nie Gong, bring Xiaowei to do the list first! Don’t worry, I’ll definitely arrange a proper position for them.” ”

Old Nie thanked her a few more times before bringing Xiaowei to do the list.

“Tang Xue looked at Old Nie’s back, her eyes filled with ridicule. ”

She wasn’t helping old nie.

She was helping herself.

“Once ye Zao fell from the altar, she would still be the brightest star in the CEN experimental base! ”

What was ye Zao?

“Speaking of which, ye Zao had dug his own grave. If she hadn’t come up with the aircraft carrier plan, things wouldn’t have turned out this way. ”

“Since ye Zao wanted to be famous so much, she would help ye Zao. Tang Xue had a plan in mind. ”

“Ruth.”

“Sister Xue.”Ruth walked to Tang Xue’s side.

“Tang Xue continued, “Post Miss Ye’s aircraft carrier plan on the International Technology website.” ”

“Currently, only the people at the CEN base knew that ye Zao was going to build an aircraft carrier. ”

Although the base was holding a press conference tomorrow.

But the international science and technology network was connected to the entire world. Wouldn’t it be better if everyone in the world knew about this news?

It was just a show.

“Of course, the more the audience, the more exciting it would be! ”

Ruth nodded. “Okay.”

“After saying this, Ruth went to the international network to release the news of ye Zao building an aircraft carrier. ”

“Not long after, a piece of news on the international network was placed at the top as a hot topic. ”

# nuhulu YC officially joined the CEN base and reached an agreement with CEN Wuye to officially develop an aircraft carrier capable of landing on the eight planets within two years! #

# NUHULU YC builds an aircraft carrier! #

# landing on the eight planets within two years! # RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Upon seeing this piece of news, the International Science and technology network exploded. ”

An aircraft carrier!

Eight planets!

And it was a two-year period.

“No matter which keyword it was, it was shocking. ”

Damn! Is this for real? Dad joined the CEN family base? and he wants to build an aircraft carrier

Dad merged with his stepmother

Dad Is Awesome

Not to mention whether he can land on the eight planets! Are you sure it’s a two-year period? Two hundred countries joined hands and haven’t built an aircraft carrier in more than sixty years. Niu Hulu can build an aircraft carrier in two years? Are you sure it’s not a joke

[ I was so scared that I dared to go in and check the calendar. I’m sure that today is not April 1st. ]

“[ when dad was dealing with dozens of missions a day, you guys said that dad was a team of a thousand people. In the end, Dad still slapped me in the face! ] ”
