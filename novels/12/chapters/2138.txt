“Your sister has no reaction at all?”Fan Mu asked.

“What reaction should she have?”Man Wen asked in confusion.

“Fan Mu said excitedly, “Your sister and the fiancée of the young master of Dongli, Duanmu Feng, have never seen eye to eye with each other. Now that this has happened, your sister should be very happy, right?” ”

“If one thought about it with one’s toes, one would know that at this moment, Manxing must be very happy! ”

He probably wanted to set off fireworks to celebrate.

“Happy?”Manwen frowned slightly. “Why should she be happy?”

“I heard that young master Dongli wants to bring his girlfriend back to the country. Who will benefit from the fight between the Snipe and clam?”Fan Mu asked in return.

“Both his girlfriend and fiancée, Manwen was a little confused when he heard that. ”T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Fan Mu explained, “Young Master Dongli grew up on Earth. His girlfriend is also from Earth. If his fiancée and his girlfriend were to face each other, the one who would benefit from the fight would definitely be your sister! Maybe you could even become young master Dongli’s brother-in-law in the future! “How are you feeling now?” ”

“In Fan Mu’s opinion, the girlfriend of Young Master Dongli on Earth was not a simple person since she could follow young master Dongli to the Allied country. ”

Three women in one show.

“This time, there was a good show to watch. ”

“”What nonsense!”Man Wen did not take these words to heart. “I’m afraid that even if she had the heart, she would not have the fate.” ”

“”That might not be the case. I’ve discovered that your man family’s genes are really quite good. Your eldest sister is the famous miss ye of Chang Yue Country, while your second sister is the Little Lucky Star of the man Xing country. She is admired by everyone!”Man Wen seemed to be a profligate profligate, in reality, he had been hiding his true self. He had been born in a complicated environment. It was not easy for man Wen to protect himself. ”

None of the three children in the man family were ordinary people.

“”I’ve said that I only have one elder sister, Manxing,”man Wen said. ”

“Hearing this, fan mu immediately changed his words. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I was wrong! You only have one elder sister, Alright?” ”

Man Wen kept the card. “Let’s Go!”

“Where are you going?”

“Man Wen said, “I have no comment.” ”

“Fan Mu looked at his back and ridiculed, “Throw it away when you’re done. Am I still your best brother?” ”

…

The Cen family.

Cen Shaoqing led his family and boarded the interstellar shuttle.

Two days later.

The interstellar shuttle arrived at the main alliance.

“Have we arrived?”Old Mrs. Cen looked at Cen Shaoqing.

Cen Shaoqing nodded. “Yes.”

“Hearing this, Zhou Xiang swallowed nervously. ”

“She was still the same as she was in the past, but Cen Haifeng was no longer the same CEN Haifeng in the past. It was unknown what kind of scene it was like when old friends met. ”

The Cen family’s four older sisters had also arrived. They looked out of the window of the shuttle curiously.

The General Alliance of the S Galaxy was indeed different from Earth.

It gave off a high-tech feeling everywhere.

The four sisters felt that it was very novel.

“Then they looked at ye Zao, who was actually sitting there calmly eating snacks. ”

Cen Yueya sighed. “When can I reach the level of Zao Zao?”

“No matter what time it was, she would not be surprised. ”

“In front of her, the main country was not as tempting as a dessert. ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and looked back. “Second sister, actually, when I first came to the main country, I was the same as you guys.” ”

“Really?”Cen Yueya asked.

“Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and continued, “Second sister, have you all read the Daily Handbook I gave you?” ”

“Everything in the main country was not quite the same as on Earth. Cen Yueya and the others came from Earth, so it was obvious that many people were waiting for the Cen family to lose face. ”

“Therefore, Ye Zhuo gave them a handbook in advance to let them understand the daily life of the Allied countries, so that they could take care of their own food, clothing, and transportation in the Allied countries without having to ask anyone. ”

“”By the way, second sister, I’ve modified your cell phones, so you can use them directly in the S Galaxy.” ”

“”Okay.”Cen Yueya nodded and continued, “Then can I use my cell phone to contact your second brother-in-law?” ”

“That won’t do.”Ye Zhuo shook his head.

“Soon, the aircraft came to a stop and the door was opened. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen was the first to walk out. Cen Yuying wanted to help old Mrs. Cen, but Old Mrs. Cen directly refused, “No need to help me. I can walk on my own.” ”

Zhou Xiang followed behind.

A daughter of the Cen family followed.

Ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing walked at the back.

“As soon as the Cen Old Lady walked out of the door, she saw her long-lost son kneeling on the ground. ”

Both sides were full of people with their heads lowered.

The scene was somewhat quiet.
