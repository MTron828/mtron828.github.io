“Bai Shu continued, “I’ve never worn such high-class clothes in my life!” ”

“Old madam CEN said, “If it wasn’t for Yezi giving it to me, it would be my first time wearing it!” ”

Bai Shu grew more and more envious of old Madam Cen.

Old Madam Cen and Ye Zhuo were even better than the grandfather and grandson pair. Why had she never met such a good granddaughter-in-law?

Bai Shu sighed softly.

On the other side.

University town.

Zhang Qingqing was dressed in designer clothing and had a six-figure bag in her hand. She stood at the school gate and waited for an Lizi.

“Not long after, an Lizi ran out from the gate. “Qingqing!” ”

“Coming.”Zhang Qingqing smiled and walked over.

“An Lizi said, “I’m sorry. I made you wait, didn’t I?” ”

“”It’s Alright,”Zhang Qingqing said. ”

“After saying that, Zhang Qingqing continued, “This dress of yours looks pretty good. It’s a new ZY brand, right?” ”

“I think so.”An Lizi had never paid attention to such things.

“Zhang Qingqing was a little speechless as she said, “You don’t even know about your own clothes?” ”

“An lizi explained, “This dress was given to me by my cousin.” ”

Only then did Zhang Qingqing remember that an Lizi’s stepfather was very rich.

“Thinking of this, Zhang Qingqing felt a little uncomfortable. When she was young, her family background was much better than an Lizi’s. ”

“Now, an Lizi was already a rich young lady, but she was still like this. ”

“Although she was also wearing branded clothes, compared to Zy, who was popular all over the world, she was not just a little inferior! ”

“Zhang Qingqing sighed. “Lizi, I really envy you!” ”

“What do you envy me for?”An Lizi felt a little baffled.

“Zhang Qingqing said, “I envy your background! Think about it, you’re a rich girl now, and I’m still the same ordinary me. In the future, the two of us won’t be in the same world! We’ll definitely go further and further away!” ”

“That won’t Happen!”An Lizi held Zhang Qingqing’s hand. “The two of US grew up together. We agreed to be friends for life.”

“Zhang Qingqing continued, “By the way, is your mother pregnant?” ” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Not yet.”An Lizi shook her head and didn’t say the reason behind it.

“”Not yet!”Zhang Qingqing was a little surprised, then, she said, “But it’s good that you’re not pregnant. If your mother is pregnant, your family’s status will definitely decline. Now, you’re the only daughter in the family! However, if your mother doesn’t get pregnant, it’s not good either. What if your stepfather dislikes your mother and won’t give birth?” ”

An Lizi’s current status was really too awkward.

“Thinking of this, Zhang Qingqing suddenly didn’t envy an Lizi anymore. ”

“An Lizi wasn’t Lin Qingxuan’s biological daughter. If Xia Xiaoman and Lin Qingxuan’s relationship went wrong one day, then an Lizi wouldn’t be some rich young lady anymore! ”

“An lizi smiled and said, “Don’t worry, my dad is not that kind of person.” ”

“Previously, when Xia Xiaoman was drugged with sleeping pills, Lin Qingxuan did not show any signs of disliking Xia Xiaoman! ”

“You can’t tell a person’s heart from their face.”Zhang Qingqing patted an Lizi’s hand.

“An Lizi said, “You don’t know my dad, but I believe in him!” ”

“Zhang Qingqing raised her head and looked at an Lizi. “What about your biological dad? Your biological dad looked so honest, but in the end, he still betrayed your mom! Lizi, after going through so much, why are you still acting like you haven’t grown up?” ”

“An Lizi didn’t say anything, but the look in her eyes was a little lonely. ”

“Zhang Qingqing continued, “Are you guys going back to your hometown for the New Year?” ”

“We’re spending the new year in Beijing.”An Lizi turned to look at Zhang Qingqing. “My mother said that we’ll go to my Grandma’s house on the third day of the New Year.”

“”OH.”Zhang Qingqing nodded. “Oh right, Lizi, you’ve been in the circle of wealthy families for such a long time. Have you met any young talents that you want to introduce to me?” ”

“Zhang Qingqing also wanted to marry into a rich family and live a life of superiority. Unfortunately, besides an Lizi, there were no other rich second-generation heirs by her side. ”

She simply did not have the chance to get to know the rich second-generation heirs.

An Lizi was stunned. “Don’t you have a boyfriend?”

“We broke up a long time ago!”Zhang Qingqing’s expression was natural.

“Zhang Qingqing had followed Wu Youyu to Beijing. After Wu Youyu and Xie Wanqiu perished together, she did not look for a second sugar daddy. ”

She did not want to look for another benefactor anymore.

She wanted to rely on herself to marry a real rich second generation!

“With her looks, as long as someone was willing to pull strings, she would definitely be able to join a wealthy family! ”

She and an Lizi were like sisters. An Lizi would definitely help her with this!

“”So, I’ll leave my happiness to you. Lizi, you must introduce me to a rich second generation. Let me live the addiction of a rich lady.”Saying this, Zhang Qingqing turned to look at an Lizi. ”
