Translator: 549690339

“Nine Miles: [ God, is the new map out yet? ] ”

Ye Zao replied: [ soon. ]

“Nine Miles: [ Okay, there’s no rush. I didn’t mean to rush you. I was just asking casually. Actually, it doesn’t matter if it’s ten days to half a month later! ] ”

[ Okay. ]

Ye Zao closed the dialog box.

Only then did he realize that there was only half an hour left until the appointment with Cen Shaoqing.

It took 10 minutes to walk from the dormitory to the school gate. She still had to wash her face and change her clothes.

“Therefore, ye Zao closed the computer and walked to the bathroom. ”

“15 minutes later, ye Zao walked out of the dormitory wearing a white suspenders shirt and black wide-legged pants. ”

“She was originally tall and slender. At this moment, she looked even taller and longer in the high-waisted wide-legged pants. Her aura was 1.8 meters. The white suspenders shirt outlined a perfect body line. Above it was an exquisite collarbone. ”

“As soon as she walked out of the dormitory, passersby frequently turned to look at her. ”

“”Brother Ze, look! Your Sister!”When dog two saw ye Zao, it excitedly elbowed Lin Ze. ”

Lin Ze looked up and frowned. His eyes were calm.

“”Brother Ze, why aren’t you excited at all?”Dog Two asked. ”

“Lin Ze asked back, “Why should I be excited?” ”

“Dog two said, “One of you is the campus Belle, and the other is the campus belle. Don’t you think that you two are fated? Wasn’t it popular to recognize younger sisters a few years ago? Why Don’t you go and recognize a younger sister for the three of us? I believe that Mosquito and fat tiger will definitely like our younger sister very much!” ”

“You’re thinking too much.”

Lin Ze glanced at dog two and walked to the other side.

Dog Two immediately followed Lin Ze’s footsteps.

“Ye Zao walked all the way to the school gate. At this moment, a tall boy suddenly blocked ye Zao’s path. “Hello, Junior. My name is Shangguan xufei. Can we get to know each other?” ”

“Ye Zao looked up slightly. “I’m sorry, but I already have a boyfriend.” ”

“Although ye Zao had already said that he had a boyfriend, Shangguan Xufei was not willing to give up just like that. After all, many girls liked to use this sentence as an excuse. “It’s just making friends. Don’t tell me that you have a boyfriend and don’t want to socialize anymore?” ”

“I really have a boyfriend. Please make way.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Ye Zao’s voice suddenly turned cold. Shangguan Xufei was stunned and took a few steps back, subconsciously making way for Ye Zao. ”

He did not even realize what was going on.

“When Ye Zao was far away, Shangguan Xufei finally reacted and scratched his head in confusion. ”

“As soon as ye Zao walked out of the school gate, he saw Cen Shaoqing’s car parked at the school gate. ”

It was a low-profile Bentley.

“There were many rich people in the capital, so a Bentley was not eye-catching. ”

Ye Zhuo walked towards the car.

“At this moment, the car door opened and a middle-aged man walked out. He was one of Cen Shaoqing’s chauffeurs. ”

“”Uncle Zhao, why is it you?”Ye Zhuo asked in surprise. “Where’s Cen Shaoqing?” ”

“Uncle Zhao opened the car door for ye Zhuo. “Master Wu was delayed by something, so he asked me to pick you up.” ”

Ye Zao nodded slightly and did not say anything else. He got into the car.

“Uncle Zhao continued, “Miss Ye, master Wu has prepared some desserts for you in the fridge.” ”

“Okay.”

“Just as ye Zao closed the car door, Feng Xianxian and Bai Xiaoman walked out from behind the sculpture in front of the school gate. ”

Both of their expressions were a little complicated.

“Bai Xiaoman said, “Xianxian, did you see ye Zao’s boyfriend Just Now?” ”

Feng Xianxian nodded.

“Bai Xiaoman continued, “I think he’s in his fifties or so?” ”

No Wonder ye Zao said that his boyfriend was an old antique!

“He was already so old, but she didn’t know how ye Zao could do that. ”

Bai Xiaoman felt goosebumps all over her body.

“Feng Xianxian looked at the back of the Bentley as it left, and the corners of her mouth curled up. “Fifty? I think he’s at least sixty or seventy! Standing with Ye Zao, he could be ye Zao’s grandfather!” ”

“Although she knew that ye Zao’s boyfriend was very old, Feng Xianxian did not expect that ye Zao’s boyfriend would be so old! ”

“Bai Xiaoman continued, “I saw that man driving a Bentley. His family background should be pretty good! Ye Zao must have taken a fancy to his money!” ”

“If it was not for money, who would be willing to date such an old man? ”

It would be more appropriate if he was older than ten years.

He was already several decades older!

Just thinking about it made him feel disgusted.

“”I didn’t expect ye Zao to be such a person!”Bai Xiaoman continued, “Xianxian, do you think that ye Zao’s boyfriend is so Old? is she being kept by someone?” ”
