Translator: 549690339

“Goading?”Ye Zao curled his lips slightly. “Then I’ll fall into your trap today and make you admit defeat wholeheartedly!”

“Hearing this, Carl’s face turned pale with fear. It was not easy for him to leave this place, but ye Zao had promised to have a bet with him.”

“On the road, Yale was known as the father of gambling!”

“From this, it could be seen how terrifying his strength was.”

But now...

Ye Zao had actually agreed to a bet with him.

Although ye Zao was also very powerful.

But what if he made a mistake?

“”An, don’t be so impulsive.”Carl tugged at ye Zao’s sleeve.”

“Don’t worry.”Ye Zao’s tone was indifferent.

“Ye Zao felt that he was much better now. He put his hands on the ground and tried to stand up. Seeing this scene, Mike could not care less about his injuries. He immediately ran to Ye Zao’s side and helped him up, yale wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and continued, “Your country has another saying, ‘Jun, jun...'””

“At this point, Yale couldn’t think of what the last sentence was.”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “A man of his word can not be taken back.””

“”Yes.”Yale covered his chest and coughed. “That’s it! I hope you won’t go back on your words and keep this in mind at all times.”In fact, Yale had never really dealt with Chinese people, he had only heard of Chinese people from other people’s mouths.”

“Greedy, selfish, and untrustworthy. These words had almost become the exclusive labels of Chinese people.”

“Although ye Zao did not look like the kind of person who would go back on her word, no one knew what kind of person she was! What kind of person was she!”

“”Don’t worry, I never go back on my word.””

“Yala nodded. “Alright, I’ll trust you this time.””

“After saying that, Yala whispered a few words to Mike.”

“Mike nodded. “Alright, Minister, I’ll do it right away!””

“Go ahead.”

“Soon, Mike arranged for someone to bring a table in.”

There was a complete set of dice cups on the table.

“Yala continued, “Today, we’ll play a different game. We’ll roll the dice and win two out of three games!””

“Since ye Zao was good at playing shuffleboard, then today, he would play something that he was good at!”

“This time, he would definitely win against ye Zao.”

“Sure.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

Yaler felt that ye Zao was a little conceited. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Rolling the dice was different from shuffleboard.

“It was not easy to cheat with the dice. It was a test of true ability. Moreover, Ye Zao was not good at this at all. If he were ye Zao, he would definitely not agree to this method of playing.”

“After all, one must act according to one’s ability.”

“Yala continued, “Since it is a competition, there must be some rewards. An, if you lose, I want you to bow down to me!””

“”No problem.”Ye Zao played with the cards in his hand. “If you lose, I want 50% of Ranito’s shares.””

Yala was stunned.

“Why don’t you dare to Bet?”Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly.

“Aren’t you a little too confident!”Yala looked at Ye Zao and narrowed his eyes.

“Ye Zao curled his lips slightly. “It’s not that I’m too confident, but you’re definitely going to lose.””

Lose?

Yala clenched his right fist.

No!

He wouldn’t lose!

“”Do you dare to Bet?”Ye Zao flicked the cards in his hand out. “If you don’t dare to bet, then don’t waste your time.””

“”In this world, there’s nothing that I, Yala, don’t dare to do!”Yala raised his head and looked at ye Zao.”

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly. “You have guts!”

The two of them sat opposite each other at the table.

“Carl stood beside ye Zao. “An, you must work hard! You must not lose!””

“When has dad ever lost?”Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly.

“Yes.”Carl nodded. “I believe in You!”

“Alar’s chest still hurt a little, and he could not help but cough.”

“His assistant Jack said with some peace of mind, “Director, I’ll ask Dr. John to come and take a look at you!””

“”No need,”Yala refused directly.”

“He wasn’t a big problem. In short, he couldn’t affect his match with Ye Zao.”

“Ye Zao took out a bottle from his pocket and threw it in Yala’s direction. He opened his red lips slightly and said, “Take it.””

Yala subconsciously reached out to take it. “What’s This?”

“Qi-strengthening pills. It’s a new achievement in the medical world. It will help with your injuries.”Ye Zao’s tone was indifferent. “I don’t want people to say that I won unjustly.”

“Yala opened the bottle cap with one hand and poured out a pill. He was about to swallow it, but Jack stopped him. “Minister! The Chinese have always been cunning! Don’t fall for her trick!”No one knew what kind of medicine ye Zao gave him.”

“”We An are not that kind of people!” Carl looked at Jack and continued, “Just like the Old Chinese saying, a dog bites Lu Dongbin and doesn’t know how to appreciate a good person! If you don’t want to eat it, return the medicine to us! Do you know how precious this medicine is? !””
