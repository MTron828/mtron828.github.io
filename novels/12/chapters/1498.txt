“Chapter 1499: 318: People don’t say much, but your grandmother is still your grandmother! 2”

“Take her out.”Jin Xi en waved his hand.

The two attendants nodded and directly carried Jin Yuyan out of the office.

“From the eldest princess to a commoner, it was just a blink of an eye. ”

“”Eldest princess, oh no, Miss Jin, Her Majesty the Empress has given you five hours to leave the imperial palace.” ”

“Hehe...”the corners of Jin Yuyan’s mouth were full of mockery.

Ridiculous.

Truly ridiculous.

“Jin Yuyan never dreamed that one day, her address would change from eldest princess to Miss Jin. ”

What should she do in the future?

Was she really going to live like a commoner?

On the other side.

C nation.

“Secretary Zhang was waiting at the airport with his men. Just as he was about to attack ye Zhuo, he suddenly received a message. ”

“When he saw the message, secretary Zhang’s expression changed. He immediately pressed the communicator beside his ear. “The situation has changed. Call off the team immediately!” ”

“Yes.”

“Hearing the response, secretary Zhang heaved a sigh of relief. Fortunately, it did not turn into a big mistake. ”

“If anything happened to Ye Zao, she would be in big trouble. ”

Why would Jin Xi En’s secretary call her out of the blue?

Secretary Zhang called Jin Yuyan’s personal assistant as he walked back.

“”Assistant Park, what’s Going On?”Secretary Zhang frowned. “Why did I hear that something happened to the Princess?” ”

Assistant Park was also a little confused.

She had just returned from her lunch break and already heard the news of Jin Yuyan being crippled.

“”I’m not too sure about the specific situation,”assistant park continued. “It seems to be related to miss ye. Anyway, Secretary Zhang, come back quickly! The princess, she, she’s no longer the princess of the Royal Family!” ”

“So, Jin Yuyan was really crippled? ”

But Jin Yuyan was Jin Xi en’s biological daughter. Jin Xi en had always thought highly of Jin Yuyan. Why would she cripple Jin Yuyan without saying a word?

Because of Ye Zhuo?

Could it be that ye Zhuo had another identity?

“For a moment, secretary Zhang was puzzled. ”

“After thinking for a moment, secretary Zhang continued, “Assistant Park, is this information accurate?” ”

“”It’s very accurate!”Assistant Park continued, “I’ve already seen the announcement made by the Empress!” ”

It seemed to be true!

“Otherwise, Jin Xi en wouldn’t have made the announcement. ”

“Although Jin Xi en had never publicly announced that Jin Yuyan was the future empress, other than Jin Yuyan, Jin Xi en didn’t have any other children. With Jin Yuyan crippled, who was Jin Xi en planning to help up? ”

Could it be that she was a niece of the founding family?

What exactly happened that made Jin Xi’en cripple his own daughter?

“Secretary Zhang frowned. “Alright, I got it! I’ll be back immediately!” ”

On the other side.

In the hotel.

Song Shiyu walked out of his room and went to the first floor. He pushed open the door to A1988.

There was no cleaning inside. Everything was still the same as when the owner left. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“The door to the balcony was open. A gentle breeze blew, bringing with it a faint fragrance. ”

“On the coffee table in front of the sofa, there was half a cup of unfinished tea and a half-finished fashion magazine. Beside it was a dessert box that had already been eaten. The trash can was also filled with empty dessert boxes. Although the room had been occupied before.., it was not messy. A faint fragrance lingered in the room. From this, it could be seen that the owner of the room was an elegant and romantic person. ”

“Song Shiyu stood in the room for a moment and made a call. “Eliminate Room 1988 from the housekeeping department. From now on, no one can come in except for me!” ”

“”Okay, boss. I’ll make the arrangements right away.”The hotel manager’s voice came from the other side. ”

“After saying that, the hotel manager continued, “Then do we still need to arrange for the cleaning staff to clean the room regularly?” ”

“”No Need,”song Shiyu said. ”

“”Okay! I got it! Boss, do you have anything else?” ”

“No.”

“The hotel manager said respectfully, “Goodbye, Boss.” ”

Song Shiyu directly hung up the phone.

“Meow!”

“At this moment, a Persian cat with shiny hair jumped in from the window. ”

Song Shiyu turned his eyes slightly and saw this cat.

“Suddenly, he felt that this cat looked familiar. Song Shiyu took out his phone and opened wechat. He saw ye Zao’s moments and clicked on the photo in his moments. The kitten in the photo was tilting its head and looking at her, [ the little guy’s tilted head kill is too cute. ] ”

The little guy with the tilted head kill was clearly the same as this kitten.

No wonder it was so familiar.

“”Little guy, come here.”Song Shiyu half squatted down and waved at the cat. ”
