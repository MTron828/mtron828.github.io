“Feng Qianxian came to the living room and made a cup of tea for Old Lady Lin. She said gently, “Grandma, two days have passed. Why do you think there is no reaction from Uncle Lin’s side? Did those shareholders’Grandpas go back on their word and not withdraw their investment?” ”

Why was Lin Jincheng so calm?

Why didn’t he come and apologize to Old Lady Lin?

He must have convinced those old shareholders not to withdraw their investment again!

“Thinking of this, Feng Xianxian’s eyebrows jumped. ”

“If those old shareholders did not withdraw their investment again, how was she going to return to the Lin Family? ”

No!

She could not let this happen.

“”It’s impossible,”Old Lady Lin said firmly. “They are definitely not that kind of people!” ”

“Those few old shareholders had been loyal to Old Master Lin. Since they had already withdrawn their investments, they would not go back on their words! ”

“After saying this, Old Mrs. Lin was a little worried again. She continued, “I’ll make a call to ask.” ”

Feng Xianxian handed the phone to Old Mrs. Lin.

Old Mrs. Lin took the phone and walked to the bedroom.

“After making the call and learning that the five shareholders were still withdrawing their investments, old Mrs. Lin heaved a sigh of relief. ”

“Seeing Old Lady Lin walk out of the bedroom, Feng Xianxian immediately walked over and asked, “How is it, Grandma? What did those shareholders Grandpa Say?” ” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“”Don’t worry.”Old Lady Lin smiled and said, “I already said that they aren’t that kind of people.” ”

“Hearing this, Feng Xianxian also heaved a sigh of relief. ”

“At this moment, Lin Jincheng must be like an ant on a hot pan. ”

“Lin Jincheng wanted to come and beg Old Lady Lin, but he couldn’t bring himself to do so. ”

Tomorrow.

“At most, he could wait until tomorrow. ”

“The five old shareholders would withdraw their capital, and the capital chain of the LIN Group would break. They wouldn’t be able to hold on for more than a few days. ”

“After Tomorrow, Lin Jincheng would definitely come and Beg Old Lady Lin. ”

Unless Lin Jincheng wanted to watch the collapse of the Lin Group with his own eyes!

“Thinking of this, a faint light flashed in Feng Xianxian’s eyes. ”

...

At the same time.

The shareholders who had withdrawn their capital were also watching the LIN Group at all times.

Zhou family.

“At this moment, Zhou Dawei was sitting in front of the computer desk in the study, looking at the stock situation of the LIN Group. ”

“Once the LIN Group could not hold on and declared bankruptcy, he could immediately start the plan to buy the LIN Group. ”

“At that time, the LIN Group would be changed to the Zhou Group. ”

“Thinking of this, Zhou Dawei’s eyes were full of pride. ”

He had planned for more than ten years to wait until today.

He had thought that he would not be able to wait until today in his lifetime.

He did not expect that this day would come so quickly!

“At this moment, the door of the study was pushed open. ”

Zhou Dawei looked up and saw an old man with white hair walking in from outside.

“This was one of the old shareholders who had withdrawn their capital, Wang Jianguo. ”

“Wang Jianguo looked at Zhou Dawei. “Brother Zhou, the Lin Group has risen by the limit three times in a day. It’s only a matter of time before they declare bankruptcy. We should be able to go to Lin Jincheng now to discuss the acquisition plan, right?” ”

“”Wait a little longer.”Zhou Dawei narrowed his eyes. “The crisis of the LIN Group has just begun. If we go to Lin Jincheng now to discuss this matter, it’s inevitable that people will talk about it.” ”

“After all, they had followed Old Master Lin for almost a lifetime. ”

Such words were not pleasant to hear.

“Although they had already shed all pretense of cordiality with Lin Jincheng, they still had to do the face project. ”

“Wang Jianguo nodded. “Brother Zhou, I understand what you mean, but you should also know in your heart that we are not the only ones who are eyeing this piece of fat meat.” ”

“There were countless people outside eyeing the LIN Group covetously, all wanting to take down the LIN Group in one fell swoop. ”

“If someone beat them to it, then their gains would not make up for their losses! ”

“When that time came, the losses would not be small. ”

“Zhou dawei smiled and said, “Brother Wang, I understand what you mean. Don’t worry, I can guarantee that other than us, no one would dare to lay a hand on the Lin Group!”The Lin Group operated household goods. ”

Those who did not understand this industry did not dare to take over rashly.

“Because if they were not careful, they would lose so much money that they would not even be able to wear pants. ”

Small businesses did not have the funds to buy them.

Medium and large enterprises did not have the courage to buy them.

“Moreover, Zhou Dawei had already made some arrangements. Once someone wanted to buy the LIN Group, someone would remind him. ”

“Therefore, he was not worried at all that the Lin group’s fat meat would be taken by others. ”

That was because there was no such possibility.

“Alright.”Wang Jianguo nodded and a worried look flashed across his face. “Then let’s Wait a little longer!”

“After saying that, Wang Jianguo continued, “Brother Zhou, you said that the LIN Corporation is about to go bankrupt. Why is Lin Jincheng still so calm? There’s no sign of him declaring bankruptcy at all! Do you think he has any other tricks up his sleeve?” ”
