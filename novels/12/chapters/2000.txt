Translator: 549690339

The originally dark and dusty fur also regained its luster at this time.

It became oily and shiny.

Da Da da —

“At this time, the sound of footsteps came from outside the confinement room. ”

“Ye Zao narrowed his eyes, put Yi Ling into the bag behind him, pressed down the hat on his head, jumped, stepped on the wall, and jumped to the ceiling. ”

He was like a light swallow.

The gravity of Planet E-TY889 was different from that of Earth.

“In addition, Ye Zao had a foundation in ancient martial arts, so on Planet E-TY889, he could jump farther and higher than Earth. ”

“A few seconds later, ye Zao used the tools he brought with him to break the defense net on the ceiling and left the detention room. ”

“When the guards at the door walked in, the detention room was empty! ”

“In an instant, sirens sounded everywhere. ”

“Yi Ling is missing! Quickly report to miss!”

“Seal all the exits immediately!”

“The Qiu family guards were also very fast. In just a few minutes, they had sealed all the exits. Not even a fly could fly out, let alone a person. ”

Unfortunately...

The person they met was ye Zao.

Qiu Di was soaking in a rose bath in the spacious bathroom.

The entire Chang Yue country was the descendant of the people of Earth.

This was the disadvantage of the people of Earth.

“No matter how advanced the technology was, the skin of the body had to be taken care of. If one was not careful, the skin would become very dry and age rapidly, especially after the humans moved to Planet E-TY889, because she was not used to the environment on Planet E-TY889, the skin problem was even more obvious. ”

“Up until now, thousands of years had passed, but this problem was still there. ”

“The election was coming soon, and she had to face the election in her best state of mind! ”

“She wanted all the people of changyue to know that not only was her ability not inferior to ye Zao, but her looks were also not inferior to ye Zao. ”

She did not know how many times more outstanding she was compared to ye Zao!

Ye Zao was already in the past!

“Now, she was the ruler of this era! ”

“Thinking of this, the corners of Qiu Di’s lips curled up, her eyes were filled with a proud arc. ”

It was a pity.

Ye Zao was already dead.

“Otherwise, she really wanted to let ye Zao see this prosperous era that she ruled ”

“At this moment, there was a knock on the door from outside the bathroom. ”

“Miss.”

“What’s Wrong?”Qiu di frowned slightly.

She hated it the most when someone came to disturb her while she was bathing in peace.

Skin needed time to sleep.

“Just like humans, when someone was suddenly awakened by an external force while they were sleeping, their mental state would also deteriorate, and their skin would also be the same. ”

Being interrupted like this.

Her rose bath was considered to be a waste.

“The person said through a curtain, “Not good, miss. . Yi, Yi Ling is missing!” ”

“”What!”Hearing this, autumn flute directly stood up from the bathtub. ”

Splash!

The sound of water was heard.

“The person outside had a troubled look on his face, so he could only repeat what he had just said. ” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“When did this happen?”Autumn flute asked.

She had clearly just returned from the isolation room.

“When she had gone, the clothes spirit was still half dead. In just half an hour, how could the clothes spirit suddenly disappear? ”

Autumn flute picked up the clothes on the side and quickly put them on.

“Hearing this, the person outside the curtain continued, “Just ten minutes ago.” ”

Whoosh.

“At this moment, autumn flute put on her clothes, opened the curtain, and walked out. ”

“Have you searched every corner of the detention room?”Qiu Di asked as he walked. “That little bastard is sinister and cunning. Don’t be fooled by his trick of luring the tiger away from the mountain!”

“”Guard Zhang has searched everywhere, but he hasn’t found any trace of Yi Ling!” ”

“Where’s Wu Han?”Qiu Di asked.

“Captain Wu has gone to the blue-red mountain. He hasn’t returned yet.”

The day of the general election was about to arrive. Wu Han had gone to the red and Blue Mountains to attack the Grade-3 armor. He was going to use it when Qiu Di was trying to win over the hearts of the people.

Qiu di frowned. “Immediately inform Wu Han to come back immediately.”

“Yes.”

“Before long, the two of them walked into the isolation room. ”

“At this moment, the isolation room was already heavily guarded. ”

“Seeing Qiu Di, guard Zhang, who was in charge of the security of the isolation room, immediately walked over. “Young miss.” ”

PA!

Qiu Di raised her hand and slapped guard ke Zhang’s face.

Guard Zhang’s left face immediately had a red and swollen palm print.

“Looking at it this way, it was a little terrifying. ”

“Trash!”Qiu Di Glared at guard Zhang. “You can’t even watch over a little bastard. What are you still living in this world for?”

“Guard Zhang’s waist was bent very low, and he didn’t even dare to make a sound. ”

He was also very wronged.

“After discovering that there was something unusual in the confinement room, he immediately rushed over. Who knew that the moment he pushed open the door, Yi Ling would disappear. ”
