“Xi Weiyue lowered her head to persuade little half moon, “Sister Half Moon, aunt is your mother. Don’t worry, she won’t hurt you.””

“No...”little half moon looked at Aunt Lang with fear in her eyes.

“Aunt Lang said, “Since Little Half Moon doesn’t want me to accompany her, then I’ll go out first. Weiyue, I’ll have to trouble you.””

“XI weiyue smiled and said, “Look at what you’re saying. We’re all family, what trouble are you talking about?””

Aunt Lang glanced at Little Half Moon and turned to walk out of the door.

Xi Weiyue looked at Aunt Lang’s back and narrowed her eyes slightly.

“About two hours later, Xi Weiyue came out of the room yawning.”

“Just as she walked out, Aunt Lang came up to her. “Little Half Moon is asleep?””

Xi Weiyue was stunned. “You’re not asleep yet?”

“MMM.”

“XI weiyue answered, “Sister Half Moon is already asleep. You can go in and see her.””

“”Okay.”Aunty Lang continued, “Weiyue, thank you for being so nice to Little Half Moon... I don’t know how to thank you.””

“With Little Half Moon’s current state, if it were anyone else, they would definitely despise her.”

“However, not only did XI weiyue not despise her, she was even so kind to little half moon. She coaxed little half moon to sleep and even personally fed her when she was eating...”

Aunt Lang was really grateful to her.

“When XI weiyue patted aunt lang, “Aunty, we’re a family. It’s not a big deal for me to do this as long as you’re willing to forgive my dad.””

“Aunt Lang said, “I don’t have any grudges against your father anymore.””

“”Aunty, thank you.”XI weiyue continued, “If my father knew, he would definitely be very happy.””

“At the end of her sentence, Xi Weiyue sighed, “Aunty, perhaps you don’t know, in order to find Sister Half Moon, my father spent a lot of effort and almost transferred the company out. Now, although the company is saved, it’s still greatly damaged. It lost 200 million, and it won’t be able to recover in a short time.””

“There’s such a Thing?”Aunty Lang was stunned.

“Xi Weiyue nodded. “Don’t look at how my father didn’t say anything. In fact, he hid all his troubles in his heart.””

Aunty Lang frowned deeply

“Obviously, she had never thought about this before.”

“Xi Weiyue Glanced at Aunty Lang and continued, “Unfortunately, I can’t help my father much! If only I had 200 million. Even if I didn’t have 200 million, it would be good to be able to enter the financial world smoothly.””

“Aunty Lang looked up at Xi Weiyue and comforted her, “Weiyue, don’t be too anxious. I believe your dad will definitely be able to get through this.””

Hearing that.

Xi Weiyue was stunned.

200 million was nothing to ye Langhua.

“After all, she still had a gold mine in her hands.”

“As long as ye Langhua called out that gold mine map, not to mention 200 million, even 1 billion wouldn’t be a problem.”

“But now, not only did ye Langhua not mention anything about the gold mine map, she also did not tell her about the Shunxi financial group, helping her smoothly enter the financial world.”

What did ye Langhua mean by this?

Xi Muwen had lost 200 million just to look for half a month.

But Ye Langhua did not seem to see this.

Just a few comforting words and she wanted to let this go?

“Xi Weiyue tried her best to suppress the anger in her heart, she sighed and said, “As a child, how can I not be anxious? Seeing my father worrying about the company every day, yet he still has to force a smile in front of us, I feel very sorry for him. It’s all my fault that I’m useless. If I can successfully enter the financial world, then he won’t have to worry so much.””

“Don’t worry.”Aunt Lang held Xi Weiyue’s hand. “All of this will pass.”

“Xi Weiyue held Aunt Lang’s hand tightly. She looked like she wanted to say something but hesitated. “Aunt, there’s something I don’t know whether to ask or not.””

“”You ask,”Aunt Lang said. “We’re all family. Just say what you have. There’s no need to hide it.””

Xi Weiyue nodded. “Then I’ll ask.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Ask away.”

“Xi Weiyue hesitated, then, she said, “I heard that you and the head of the Shunxi Financial Group are old friends? “Although I know it’s not good to do this, I really have no choice now. I want to help my father. If you know the head of the Zhao Financial Group, can you help me introduce the head of the Zhao Financial Group?””

“Since ye Langhua didn’t mention anything about the Shunxi Financial Group, she could only bring it up.”

“Aunt Lang shook her head. “Weiyue, if I knew Master Zhao, I would definitely introduce him to you even if you didn’t have to tell me. But I really don’t know him.”Ever since the day Old Master Ye was about to leave the financial world.., ye Langhua had no intention of going back.”
