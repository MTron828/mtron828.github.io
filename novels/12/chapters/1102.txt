“Chapter 1103: 243: Master Technology, Control Finance! Almighty Burning! 5”

Translator: 549690339

Can She really do two things at once?

Know Technology.

Control Finance.

Is there such an almighty person in the world?

Even Old Master Ye back then probably couldn’t do this.

Ye was only 20 years old.

She hadn’t graduated from university yet.

She studied chemistry that was completely incompatible with finance.

Can She really do it?

“Looking at the expressions of the directors, Zhao Xueyin’s lips curled up without a trace. ”

The good show had just begun!

There would be ye Zao to suffer in the future.

“Elder sun turned to look at elder Guo beside him and said in a low voice, “Elder Guo, what do you think of Miss Ye?” ”

Elder Guo’s expression was a little complicated.

“He was elder Ye’s most loyal subordinate, and now that he had finally looked forward to Elder Ye’s descendant, he was not as happy as he had imagined. ”

“What do you think?”Elder Guo asked in return.

“Elder sun continued, “To be honest, this miss ye is not quite what I had imagined. She’s already 20 years old and hasn’t graduated from university yet. Although she has some achievements in the scientific and technological world, it’s a pity that she’s too impetuous! “Do you think that the aircraft carrier can be built just because it can be built? “The aircraft carrier project hasn’t been completed yet, and now she’s come to the financial world. Do you think she can handle it?” ”

“Speaking up to this point, elder Sun pretended to sigh, “Right now, I just hope that this miss ye won’t embarrass the old man! The old man’s illustrious reputation was ruined by his daughter in the end, and now there’s an unreliable great-granddaughter. The old man’s life is really too rough! Now that he’s buried in the ground, he can’t be at ease!” ”

“Hearing these words, elder Guo’s brows furrowed even more tightly. ”

“No matter what, he couldn’t let the old man’s reputation be damaged because of ye Zhuo. ”

“Seeing that the fire was almost ready.., elder sun continued, “Elder Guo, I was just casually saying it. You mustn’t take it to heart! It’s said that one can not judge a book by its cover. What if this miss ye really is a capable person?” ”

Capable?

Would a truly capable person boast of building an aircraft carrier within two years?

This was an aircraft carrier!

“Not to mention an aircraft carrier, even producing an aircraft cannon was not a simple matter. ”

“For a moment, elder Guo’s heart was filled with a thousand twists and turns. ”

“Zhao Xueyin looked at the reactions of the people below the stage and then said, “Uncles, you’ve already met Miss Ye. Why don’t we call it a day for today’s meeting? I want to bring sister ye Zhuo to familiarize herself with the consortium for the rest of the time.” ”

“”Alright, let’s call it a day.”Elder Sun stood up from his chair. ”

“Immediately after, the other directors also stood up and walked out one after another. ”

“Elder Guo turned to look at elder Zhang. “Elder Zhang, can I have a word with you?” ”

“Sure.”Elder Zhang nodded and followed elder Guo’s footsteps.

“Looking at the backs of the two old directors, Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes. ” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Elder Guo brought elder Zhang to the office at the side and did not forget to lock the door.

“Elder Zhang smiled and said, “What’s the matter? Why Are You So Mysterious?” ”

Elder Guo furrowed his brows tightly. “Is that young lady outside really the descendant of the old man?”

“”She’s the real deal!”Elder Zhang patted his chest and continued, “How is it? You also think that child is not bad, right?” ”

“”Where do you see that she is not bad?”Elder Guo continued, “She is already 20 years old and she is still studying in university. She is also majoring in chemistry! Are you sure that such a person can take the lead? I think she is not as good as Zhao Xueyin!” ”

“Initially, he was full of expectations for ye Zhuo. ”

“After hearing these things, his heart turned cold. ”

Not as good as Zhao Xueyin?

Ye Zhuo not as good as Zhao Xueyin?

“In elder Zhang’s opinion, even a hundred Zhao Xueyin could not be compared to one ye Zhuo. ”

“Elder zhang said unhappily, “Old Guo, I say, are you getting more and more muddle-headed as you get older? How is Zhuo Zhuo not as good as Zhao Xueyin? ! She’s only twenty years old and she’s already a phd in science and technology. Have you ever seen such a young Phd? ! Let me tell you, Zhuo Zhuo’s achievements are far more than what we’ve seen ! She has her own achievements in every field ! She just doesn’t want to show them off ! Don’t look at people through the crack of the door!” ”

Elder Zhang was convinced of ye Zao’s ability.

“”Who’s The Old Fool?”Elder Guo lowered his voice and said, “Build a space mothership and land on the eight planets within two years? China is the number one technological country. After decades of research, they still haven’t built a space mothership! Ye Zao is only 20 years old! Don’t you think that she is just being unbridled? We are in finance, so we have to be down-to-earth! What do you think she can do with such a person?” ”

“Elder zhang said firmly, “I believe that Zao Zao will definitely be able to build a space carrier!” ”
