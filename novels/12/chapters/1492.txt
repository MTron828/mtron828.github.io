“The woman looked around and saw a man in a police uniform. She said, “Wait.””

Scarface also saw that something was wrong. He put down the beer bottle and sat back on the chair.

“The woman continued, “According to Secretary Zhang, this ye Zhuo is not an ordinary person. Be careful.””

“The scar-faced man’s face was filled with disdain. She was just a little girl. Even if she wasn’t ordinary, how could she not be ordinary?” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

What a joke!

“”Don’t worry.”The scar-faced man continued, “This day next year will be her few days.””

The woman looked in the direction of Ye Zhuo.

“From the looks of it, this little girl, other than having an outstanding temperament in the crowd, didn’t seem to be any different.”

Perhaps secretary Zhang was too cautious.

“After thinking for a while, the woman said, “In any case, be careful. Don’t capsize in the Gutter.””

Capsize in the gutter?

The scar-faced man curled the corners of his lips.

“He had been on country C road for more than ten years, and he had met all kinds of people. How could he be in the hands of a little girl?”

“After saying that, the woman continued, “Wait until the police officer has left before making a move.””

The scar-faced man nodded.

Ye Zhuo walked to the opposite side of Carl and sat down.

“The light in the snack street was not bright. In addition, she was wearing a hat, so people could not see her face clearly.”

It was hazy and indistinct.

“Carl said, “The durian halberd here is especially good. Try It.””

Ye Zhuo took a bite.

“”It’s not bad, right?”Carl asked.”

“It is indeed not bad.”Ye Zhuo nodded.

“In fact, she had already eaten dinner, but she still couldn’t control herself when faced with such a delicious dessert.”

“Carl then took out a document. “An, take a look at this. If there are no problems, just sign it.””

Ye Zhuo reached out and took the document.

It was about Ranidou’s contract.

“As expected, Yaler was a man of his word.”

“After reading ten lines, Ye Zhuo signed the English name.”

“Seeing that she signed the contract so quickly, Carl couldn’t help but remind her, “An, Yala is a man of many tricks. Look carefully and don’t fall for his tricks.””

“Although Carl had read the contract several times, he was still a little worried.”

“”Yes, I know.”Ye Zhuo nodded, put away the document, and continued to eat the Durian Halberd.”

Know?

He could eat so happily even if he knew?

Shouldn’t Ye Zao be reading the contract now?

What if Yaler secretly set a trap for ye Zao?

“”An,”Carl continued, “Aren’t you going to continue reading?””

“”I’ve read it. Don’t worry, there’s no problem.”Ye Zao’s tone was clear and shallow. “Although Yaler is crafty and has a bad reputation, he still has this little quality.””

“Really?”Carl asked.

“Really.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Seeing ye Zao so sure, Carl was no longer worried.”

Ye Zao continued to eat the Durian Halberd.

Durian and stinky tofu were the same. They smelled stinky and tasted fragrant.

“Other than vegetables like Toona, there were few things that ye Zao did not like to eat.”

“After eating a durian halberd, ye Zao flipped through the menu and found that this shop not only had desserts, but also skewers.”

“The weather in C Nation was good, so it was very suitable for eating kebabs and drinking beer.”

“She was not hungry initially, but after eating a dessert, she felt a little hungry.”

“Especially the taste of kebabs on both sides was straight into the nose, making people unable to stop.”

“Do you want to drink beer?”Ye Zao looked at Carl.

“”I can have some, I can hold my liquor very well.”Carl nodded.”

He ordered a pint of beer and then some kebabs.

“Soon, the waiter came up with beer and kebabs.”

Ye Zhuo took a sip of the cold beer. He was glad that Cen Shaoqing was not by his side.

“Otherwise, he would not have allowed her to touch the cold beer.”

“Ever since he got together with Cen Shaoqing, Ye Zhuo felt like he had an old father.”

PA —

“While ye Zhuo was eating and chatting with Carl, a fierce-looking man with a scar on his face suddenly appeared in front of the table and slammed the beer bottle in his hand on the table.”

The loud noise made the diners who were eating nearby look over.

“Carl was shocked and looked up at the man with a scar on his face, “Sir, what’s the matter?””

“”This has nothing to do with you. If you don’t want to die, get out of my way!”After saying that, the man with a scar on his face turned to look at ye Zao, he said fiercely, “I’ll give you ten minutes to pay the 50 million that you owe us! Otherwise, don’t blame me for being rude to you!””

50 million?

This young girl actually owed someone 50 million.

“When the surrounding diners who were eating heard this, they all dismissed the idea of calling the police.”
