“After all, Li Xiang was now standing in front of everyone unharmed, and her son’s whereabouts were still unknown. ”

“As a mother, how could Tian Zhifang withstand such a blow? ”

“Zifei...”Tian Zhifang squatted on the ground and sobbed softly.

“”Mom.”At this moment, a tall figure walked down from the aircraft. ”

Mom? Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Tian Zhifang was stunned.

Was she hearing things?

“Otherwise, why did she hear Yu Zifei calling her mom? ”

“Hearing this voice, Tian Zhifang couldn’t control herself anymore. ”

“”Zifei, zifei, come back quickly!” ”

“”Mom, I’m back.”Yu Zifei walked up to Tian Zhifang. ”

Tian Zhifang was stunned.

It was Yu Zifei’s voice!

This was Yu Zifei’s voice!

“She didn’t Mishear, and she definitely didn’t Mishear! ”

Tian Zhifang looked up and saw Yu Zifei standing in front of her in perfect condition.

“Although her clothes were all torn, as a mother, Tian Zhifang still recognized her son at a glance. ”

“”Mom,”Yu Zifei looked at Manchester United’s mother with tears in her eyes and felt very guilty. “Mom, I’m sorry to have made you worry!” ”

“Although it had only been five days, Tian Zhifang’s hair had become more than half white, and she had become a lot older. ”

“”Zifei, it’s really you!”Tian Zhifang’s tears gushed out at this moment. She held Yu Zifei’s hands tightly and hugged him. ”

“Although she hugged Yu Zifei tightly, Tian Zhifang still felt that it was not real. ”

She couldn’t believe that Yu Zifei had returned.

“After all, before this, she had already prepared for the worst. ”

“At this moment, Tian Zhifang’s voice was trembling. “Zifei! Is It really you?” ”

“”Mom, it’s me.”Yu Zifei’s voice was close to choking. “It’s really me.” ”

“Zifei!”Tian Zhifang lost control of her emotions. She hugged Yu Zifei and cried out loud. She cried louder than ever before.

It was the kind of unbridled crying.

“In the past, if she wanted to cry, she had to hide from father Yu. She had suppressed her feelings so much that it was hard for her to bear. ”

No one could understand this kind of feeling of recovering from a loss.

She was back!

Her son was back.

“From now on, she didn’t have to be an old man who had lost his love. ”

“Thinking of this, Tian Zhifang was ecstatic. She even wanted to scream. ”

“When she looked up, she saw ye Zao standing there. Tian Zhifang walked over. “Miss Ye, thank you! Thank you for not giving up on Zifei.” ”

“After all, as a mother, Tian Zhifang almost gave up on Yu Zifei. ”

“If not for ye Zao’s persistence, would Yu Zifei still be there? ”

“Therefore, Tian Zhifang was very grateful to ye Zao. ”

“Ye Zao smiled at Tian Zhifang. “Auntie, you’re welcome. This is what I should do.” ”

“After saying that, Ye Zhuo turned to look at Yu Zifei. “Team leader Yu, are you still feeling unwell?” ”

“”I’m not feeling unwell. Everything is fine,”Yu Zifei replied. ”

“In the five days that they had been missing, apart from the lack of food and water, they did not have any other problems. ”

“As for the problem caused by the lack of food and water, Ye Zhuo had already completely solved it. Currently, Yu Zifei’s body did not feel any discomfort. ”

“”Let’s go for another full-body check-up,”ye Zhuo said. ”

“Okay.”Yu Zifei nodded.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Xiao Gu! Arrange for team leader Yu and assistant Xiao Li to go for a full-body check-up.”Although the two of them did not seem to have any problems now.., however, this was Mars after all, and many things were unknown. They still needed to have a check-up before they could be at ease. ”

“”Yes, Miss Ye.”Gu Si jogged over. ”

“”Team leader Yu, assistant Xiao Li, come with me.” ”

Yu Zifei and Li Xiang wanted to follow Gu Si’s footsteps.

“Tian Zhifang and Li Xiang’s parents were standing at the entrance of the physical examination room, waiting for them. ”

“Mother Li said, “God is really blessed to let both of them be safe! Think about it, she’s my only daughter. If anything happens to her, then I won’t be able to live anymore!” ”

Mother Li wasn’t joking with this last sentence.

“If something happened to Li Xiang, she really wouldn’t be able to live anymore. ”

“She remembered that year when she gave birth to Li Xiang, she gave birth for three days and three nights. She was in so much pain that she wanted to die, but in the end, she persevered. ”

“Perhaps it was because she knew how hard it was for her mother to give birth, so after she was born, Li Xiang was obedient and sensible. She didn’t cause any trouble during her confinement. ”

“Her cousin, who was born with her, tormented her parents at night. However, Xiao Li Xiang did not even make a sound. ”

“After Li Xiang was born, her mother did not give birth to a second child. She focused on nurturing Li Xiang into a capable person. The fact that Li Xiang was able to work in the Cen family base had always been her mother’s greatest pride. ”
