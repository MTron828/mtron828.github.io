“By the time she finished her sentence, the old lady was already in tears, and her eyes were extremely red and swollen. ”

Her life was neither long nor short.

“If she had known that Feng Qi would go down the wrong path in the end, she might as well have strangled her to death when she was young so that she would not embarrass herself now. ”

“”My life has been a failure from the beginning to the end. Here, I apologize to everyone. I have let down everyone, the Cen family base, and Miss Ye. Please rest assured, I will never tolerate a granddaughter who betrayed her country.” ”

“At the end of her speech, the old lady stood up and bowed deeply to the screen. ”

“At this moment, the netizens who were watching the video were also in tears. ”

“The old lady was already 89 years old. She should be enjoying her retirement, but she had experienced two joys and sorrows. ”

“Her daughter had betrayed her country and died on an alien planet. In the end, not even a complete corpse was left behind. ”

Her only granddaughter had also gone down the same path.

“If it had been anyone else, they might not have been able to bear to do such a thing to their only granddaughter. ”

But the old lady had done it.

She was the hero of the people!

“[ after watching it, she really couldn’t help but cry. The old lady is already so old, yet she still has to endure such pain... ]. ... more importantly, the old lady’s Outlook on life is very good. Many young people are not even half as good as her ! She is the role model for the young people of our generation. ] ”

“[ I also cried. The old lady has had a good journey. There is no pain in heaven. Also, Feng Ying deserves to die. Traitors should die! ] ”

“[ old lady, from now on, we will all be your grandchildren. ] ”

“”If it wasn’t for the old lady’s video, we would have misunderstood Dr. YC.” ”

“I knew Dr. YC wouldn’t betray us.”

“”Guys, I have already found the IP address of the informant!”! “He is from C Nation!”! “And Tina is from C Nation’s scientific research community. I think everyone already knows who is messing around and making US misunderstand Dr. YC!” ”

[ that Dr. Cara is too shameless. ]

“[ we owe Dr. YC an apology, and we also owe the old lady an apology. ] ”

No one had expected that this matter would be so complicated.

On the other side.

C country.

“When Dr. Cara saw this video, he was in a bad mood. He immediately dialed Tina’s number. ”

“Dr. Cara.”

“Tina! Look at what you’ve Done!”

Dr. Tina was stunned. “What’s Wrong?”

“Go and watch the news yourself.”Dr. Cara resisted the urge to kill.

“Tina held her phone in one hand and turned on her computer with the other, opening the news APP. ”

“As soon as she opened the APP, a video popped up, with more than 100 million views! ” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“The comments below also exceeded 500,000. ”

Tina’s face turned pale.

Why is this video so familiar?

Didn’t she destroy the video already?

Why is this video still on the internet?

“At this moment, Tina’s hands were shaking. ”

“Just Yesterday, Tina found a video in the Feng family Villa. ”

“In the video, the old lady clearly recorded the whole project. ”

“After discovering the video from the video recorder, Tina immediately reported the situation to Dr. Cara. ”

“Then, she destroyed the video. ”

“But now, how did the video suddenly appear on the internet? ”

“Dr. Cara said angrily, “Tina, how did you do it?” ”

“Now, Dr. Cara even suspected that Tina was a spy who deliberately sent the video to the outside world. ”

“Otherwise, why would the video that had already been deleted appear on the internet? ”

“YC had already become the existence of the Internet trolls, but in the blink of an eye, she had become the glorious YC again. ”

How could Dr. Kali be satisfied with this!

“”Dr. Kali, I don’t know what’s going on either, but I can assure you that I really deleted the video!” ”

There was no response from the other side of the phone.

“Tina was stunned for a moment, then she continued, “Dr. Cara?” ”

The response to Tina was still silence.

Could it be that the signal was cut off?

Tina frowned.

“On the other side, a sharp knife was pressed against Dr. Cara’s neck. ”

“The sharp blade pierced through the skin, and bright red blood instantly gushed out from the skin. ”

“Dr. Cara didn’t even dare to make a sound. He raised his hands and looked at the tall man who was controlling him from the corner of his eyes. “Guns and knives have no eyes. Brother, calm down. I’ll give you anything you want.” ”

“People were afraid of being famous, but pigs were afraid of being strong. ”

“Dr. Cara stood too high, and there were many people who were jealous of him. However, these people were all here for money. ”

“As long as they gave money, they could get rid of the disaster. ”
