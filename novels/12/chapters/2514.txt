Cold-blooded.

Ruthless.

“”Then, did boss song like any girls before?”Doctor Liu asked again. ”

“”No.”The Butler shook his head and continued, “But there are many who like third master. Chen Siyan is a good example.” ”

“At the mention of Chen Siyan, Doctor Liu was silent for a moment. He swallowed all the words that he had not finished. ”

The two of them were silent the entire way.

“The Butler walked doctor Liu to the door before he stopped. “Doctor Liu, be careful on the road.” ”

“”Thank you.”Doctor Liu continued, “If anything happens to boss song, you can let me know at any time.” ”

“Okay.”The butler nodded.

“After watching doctor Liu’s car disappear into the night, the butler retracted his gaze and walked back. ”

In the car.

Doctor Liu received a phone call.

“”Hello, Brother. Have you asked around? What kind of girl does boss song like?” ”

Doctor Liu held the phone with one hand. “Don’t even dream about it. Boss song is not someone you can dream of.”

“”Brother, why are you such a hypocrite? !”The voice on the phone sounded a little angry, “I’m your biological sister! I don’t understand the principle of having the upper hand! If you, as a brother, don’t help me, who else can help me?” ”

“Doctor Liu continued, “Do you know Chen Siyan?” ”

“Doctor Liu suddenly changed the topic, causing the person on the other end of the phone to be stunned. He continued, “Is it that female entrepreneur who committed suicide a while ago?” ”

“Yes.”

“What about her?”The person on the other end asked.

“Doctor Liu said, “She committed suicide because of boss song.” ”

“What?”

“Doctor Liu continued, “So, don’t think about those impossible things. Chen Siyan is better than you in every aspect, but she still can’t catch Boss Song’s eye. As for you, it’s even more impossible!” ”

“How do you know I can’t do it if you don’t try?”

“Doctor Liu said helplessly, “You can’t even get in touch with boss song. How do you want to try?” ”

“The other side was stunned for a moment and then said, “Brother, help me!” ”

“”I think you’re Daydreaming!”After saying that, doctor Liu directly hung up his sister’s call and threw the phone in the passenger seat. ”

Three days later.

Ye Zao returned to Beijing.

“He hadn’t seen his parents for nearly a month and a half. The Moment Ye Zao reached home, he gave ye Shu and Lin Jincheng a big hug. ”

“Mom and Dad.”

“You’re back.”Ye Shu patted ye Zao’s back. “What do you want to Eat Tonight?”

Ye Zao gave a long list of dishes in one breath.

“Bai Jingshu brought a large plate of fruit. “Zao must be hungry since he just got off the plane, right? Quickly come and give me some fruit as a cushion.” ”

“”Thank you, sister-in-law.”Ye Zhuo walked over and started eating the fruits. ”

“At this moment, ye Zhuo suddenly felt that something was wrong with Bai Jingshu. ”

“Chinese medicine was most particular about looking, smelling, and asking questions. ”

“”Sister-in-law, have you been having trouble sleeping recently?”Ye Zhuo asked. ”

Bai Jingshu pressed on the Sun. “A little.”

“”Let me take a look at you.”Ye Zhuo reached out and placed his hand on Bai Jingshu’s wrist, starting to listen to her pulse. ”

“A moment later, her expression changed. She turned to look at Bai Jingshu and said, “Sister-in-law, I have news for you.” ”

“What News?”Bai Jingshu asked.

Ye Zao helped Bai Jingshu up. “Sit down first.”

Bai Jingshu immediately sat up straight.

“Ye Zao then looked at Ye Shu and Lin Jincheng. “Dad, Mom, come over here for a moment!” ”

“What’s Wrong?”Ye Shu asked.

“Where’s My Brother?”Ye Zhuo continued to ask.

“Bai Jingshu replied, “Your brother is at the company and has been quite busy recently. He often arrives home at midnight.” ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“While they were talking, Ye Shu and Lin Jincheng had already sat down. ”

“”Zhuo Zhuo, do you have anything to say?” ”

“Ye Zhuo said mysteriously, “A piece of good news and a piece of bad news. Which one do you want to hear?” ”

“Let’s hear the bad news first!”Lin Jincheng said.

“Ye Shu nodded, and Bai Jingshu nodded as well. ”

“Ye Zao looked at Bai Jingshu. “The good news is that sister-in-law, you won’t be able to live alone with my brother anymore.” ”

“What about the Good News?”Bai Jingshu was stunned for a moment before asking.

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “The good news is that I’m going to be an aunt.” ”

An aunt?

“Ye Shu instantly reacted. “Zao Zao, are you saying that Jingshu is pregnant?” ”

Bai Jingshu also looked at ye Zao in surprise.

Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Yes.”
