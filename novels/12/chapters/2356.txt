Translator: 549690339

Why would Lin ze want to be with BAI Jingshu just to piss her off?

That damned Bai Jingshu!

Old Lady Shangguan was also an idiot. Couldn’t she tell that the person Lin Ze really liked was her?

How could there be such an idiot in this world? !

“Bai Mo bit her lower lip tightly. Because she had used too much force, her lip was already bleeding from the bite. ”

It was very painful.

“However, Bai Mo did not react at all, because the anger and regret in her heart had already overshadowed the pain. ” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

This kind of feeling could only be understood by those who had experienced it.

“Seeing Bai Mo like this, Bai Yuanyuan could not help but say, “Mo Mo, don’t worry. The blood bracelet will belong to you sooner or later. Bai Jingshu is nothing. She has no right to snatch it from you!” ”

“”Do you think Lin Ze has fallen in love with her already?”At this moment, Bai Mo was also a little worried. After all, Lin Ze had already begun to ignore her. ”

“Bai Jingshu was very good-looking. She had a face, a body, and a figure. Very few men could resist such a woman. ”

“If Lin Ze fell in love with someone else, wouldn’t she be too wronged? ”

“”He won’t!”Bai Yuanyuan said firmly. “After all, you were the one who first met Lin Ze. In Lin Ze’s heart, Bai Jingshu is your substitute! How could a substitute like her replace you? Dream On! So, Momo. “You don’t have to worry at all now. Wait until Lin Ze marries Bai Jingshu back and then kick her! “Nothing is more painful than losing her after you get her!” ”

“Love was a very strange existence, and the Order of appearance was also very important. The first to arrive always occupied the most important position, and the second to arrive could only be a substitute! ”

“For example, the current Bai Jingshu. ”

“Despite Bai Jingshu’s current glory, once Lin Ze found out about Bai Mo’s intentions, Bai Jingshu would immediately be dumped by Lin Ze. ”

“”But Lin Ze doesn’t even look at me now.”Although Bai Mo didn’t want to admit this, this was reality after all. ”

“Bai Yuanyuan continued, “Mo Mo, are you stupid? ! If you were in Lin Ze’s shoes, would you show reluctance to part with a girl who once rejected you? “Moreover, today is Lin Ze and Bai Jingshu’s wedding. No matter how much he likes you, he will restrain himself!” ”

“Really?”Bai Mo seemed to see Light and hope.

Bai Yuanyuan nodded. “Of course! What you can’t have will always be in turmoil. All men are like that. Don’t Worry!”

“To Lin Ze, Bai Mo was the one who couldn’t get what she wanted. ”

“Bai Yuanyuan continued, “Mo Mo, if you become the mistress of the Shangguan family in the future, don’t Forget Me!” ”

“Don’t worry.”Bai Mo nodded.

Bai Yuanyuan hugged Bai Mo’s hand excitedly.

“Sister.”

“At this moment, Bai Jingfei’s voice suddenly appeared in the air. ”

Bai Jingshu looked up and saw Bai jingfei panting.

“Jingfei.”

“Bai jingfei wiped the sweat off her forehead and said, “SIS, can I Talk to you alone for a Moment?” ”

Bai Jingshu looked at Lin Ze and nodded. “Okay.”

“After receiving Bai Jingshu’s approval, Bai Jingfei immediately pulled Bai Jingshu to a side room. ”

“In the quiet room, there were only the two sisters. ”

“Bai Jingfei looked at Bai Jingshu. “Sis, you’re really beautiful today.” ”

“”Thank you,”Bai Jingshu said with a smile. ”

“Bai jingfei continued, “SIS, I know that you’ve never liked me as your little sister. Indeed, I’m not a good little sister at all. When I was young, I was always jealous of you. I was jealous that you were prettier than me, smarter than me, and more likable than me... “... “...”thinking back to when she was young.., bai Jingfei’s eyes were slightly red. ”

The two sisters fought and laughed along the way.

“Although she wasn’t a very good sister, Bai Jingshu had always been a good sister. ”

“”Sister, I’m sorry.”Bai Jingfei said these three words with some sobs, “You’re going to get married today. Although the brother-in-law you chose isn’t the brother-in-law I like and my ideal brother-in-law, I still want to give you my blessings. I wish the two of you a good marriage for a hundred years and an early child. If he dares to bully you, Tell Me! “If others don’t stand up for you, I, your sister, Will Stand Up for you!” ”

“As a sister, Bai Jingfei knew Bai Jingshu’s personality very well. She also knew that once Bai Jingshu made a decision, she would never go back. ”

It was useless to persuade her.

She could only wish him well.

“Although in the eyes of others, Bai Jingshu was asking for trouble by marrying Lin Ze and lowering her status, Bai Jingfei saw something different. ”
