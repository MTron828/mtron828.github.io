The servants of the Lin family each had their own duties.

“Auntie Sun brought Sun Jiayi to the side of the Butler and took the initiative to introduce, “Butler, this is my daughter, Sun Jiayi. Jiayi, this is Butler Uncle Wang.””

“”Hello, Uncle Wang.”Sun Jiayi greeted politely.”

“The butler smiled and said, “Hello, I heard from your mother that you are from a normal school, right?””

Sun Jiayi nodded. “Yes.”

“The butler said, “The normal school is good. After graduating from a normal school, you can become a teacher.”. “Unlike that brat of mine, who isn’t obedient at all. We asked him to become a civil servant, but he insisted on starting his own business. Up until now, it was us parents who gave him money to use! “We don’t know when he will become successful.””

“Auntie sun smiled and said, “It’s very fast. Who knows when the child will become a big boss!””

“”Then I’ll rely on your good words,”the Butler said with a smile.”

“After getting to know the butler, Auntie Sun took Sun Jiayi to walk around in front of the other servants who were working and greeted them.”

“After walking around, Sun Jiayi said unhappily, “Mom, what are you doing? Bring me to meet some lower-class people! Do you really want me to be a servant here for the rest of my life?””

“”Don’t look down on those people,”aunt sun continued, “You are a scholar, so you should know better than mom that ants can shake an elephant.””

“Sun Jiayi rolled his eyes, “I only know that these lower class people will always be lower class people. Those who are close to the Vermilion Bird will be red and those who are close to the ink will be black. If you stay with the lower class people for too long, your thoughts will also be assimilated by them! Mom, you are hopeless. If our family wants to turn over a new leaf, we can only rely on me!””

“After saying that, sun jiayi continued, “When I become the mistress of this family, Mom, I will let you have a taste of this matriarch in charge of the family!””

“Auntie Sun hurriedly held sun jiayi’s mouth, “What nonsense are you talking about! You are worried that trouble will come from your mouth!””

“”What are you afraid of? There is no one here.”Sun Jiayi continued, “Moreover, didn’t you bring me here because of this idea!””

“Auntie sun continued, “You can’t say it out loud! What if the walls have ears? !””

Sun Jiayi didn’t say anything.

Auntie Sun pulled on Sun Jiayi’s wrist and opened the door of the lounge. “Come in with me.”

Sun Jiayi followed her into the lounge.

“The lounge was very luxurious, and there was a family photo on the cabinet by the side.”

The family photo was obviously taken when Lin Qingxuan and Xia Xiaoman were married.

There must be more than twenty people on it.

“”Mom, which one is the owner of this villa?”Sun Jiayi picked up the family photo.”

“Auntie Sun pointed at Lin Qingxuan and Xia Xiaoman and said, “This is Mr. Lin, this is Mrs. Lin, and this is their daughter, an Lizi.””

“Sun Jiayi looked at the family photo carefully. “Although Mr. Lin is over forty years old, he is still quite handsome! It would be great if he could be younger!””

“”What’s the use of being young! As long as he has money!”Auntie Sun continued to speak, “They have been married for more than a year and haven’t had a child yet. Jiayi, if you can give Mr. Lin a son, then from now on, you will be the mistress of this family! And what about Xia Xiaoman!””

“”Mom, don’t worry. As long as you give me a chance, subduing this kind of old man is a piece of cake for me,”said Sun Jiayi.”

“Auntie Sun nodded, “Okay, so from now on, Jiayi, you have to listen to me. Build a good relationship with the servants outside. Isn’t there a saying in the book? The dam within a thousand miles is destroyed by an ant’s nest. You must not underestimate those servants!””

“Although Xia Xiaoman was beautiful, she was still a person in her forties. Mother Xu was half-old. How could she compare to the young and lively Sun Jiayi?”

“Moreover, an Lizi was not Lin Qingxuan’s biological daughter.”

“Most importantly, Xia Xiaoman and Lin Qingxuan were half-married.”

“Lin Qingxuan could even get rid of his first wife, let alone Xia Xiaoman, who was second-hand.”

“Therefore, in this family, sooner or later, Sun Jiayi had to make the decision.”

It was just a matter of time.

“Thinking of this, a faint light flashed in Auntie Sun’s eyes.”

“She had been a lowly person for half of her life. She had always looked at people’s expressions. Finally, it was time for her daughter to turn over a new leaf!”

Finally!

She wanted to see who would dare to look down on them in the future!

“Sun Jiayi turned to look at auntie sun and continued, “Mom, what if Xia Xiaoman suddenly gets pregnant? You Can’t stop taking that medicine!””

“Don’t Worry!”Auntie Sun nodded. “How could mom forget about this?”

“From the beginning when she came to the Lin family to be a servant, she knew that the male and female owners of this family were a half-way husband and wife. Later, when she saw Xia Xiaoman’s eagerness to have children, Auntie Sun knew that her chance had come.”Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com
