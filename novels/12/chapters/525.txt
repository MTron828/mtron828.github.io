“Chapter 526: 134: continuous face slapping, large-scale true fragrance scene! 3”

Translator: 549690339

Blood boiling! Tears welling up in My Eyes!

This kind of feeling could only be felt by someone who truly understood music.

“Feng Xianxian stood rooted to the spot, just looking at ye Zao who was playing. ”

Her face was slightly pale. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

How could ye Zao play the piano?

And it was such a difficult tune.

Even she didn’t know this tune.

Feng Xianxian was supposed to go up on stage and Crush Ye Zao.

She did not expect to be crushed by ye Zao instead!

Her level nine piano instantly became a joke in front of ye Zao’s “Piano Concerto No. 3.”.

Everyone was dumbfounded during the banquet.

Only Cen Shaoqing remained indifferent.

He had long known that ye Zao was a treasure.

She could bring unexpected surprises to people at any time.

Old Mrs. Cen was extremely excited. Her granddaughter-in-law was really amazing!

She directly made those who looked down on her slap her in the face.

“Especially that old fool, Zhao fangyue! ”

“Old Mrs. Cen looked at Old Mrs. Lin, who was standing on the stage with her mouth agape, and the gloominess in her heart instantly disappeared. ”

Ye Zhuo’s piano piece stunned everyone.

“Until the end of the piece, everyone was still immersed in the passionate music just now. ”

Clap Clap Clap —

“Then, there was an overwhelming applause. ”

“Feng Qianxian was very embarrassed at how intense the applause was, but she had to calm down. At this time, she could not be stage-shy. “Sister is really amazing. I’m proud of you.” ”

“Ye Zhuo stood up and turned to look at Feng Xianxian, “I don’t know who that young lady is. Thank you for the piano. I like it very much. “But please watch your words. My mother only has two children, my brother and me. You’ve always claimed to be my sister. If people who don’t know hear you, they’ll think that you’re my father’s illegitimate daughter.” ”

This sentence was a reminder and also a blow.

“Ye Zhuo’s tone was faint, but it carried an aura that others could not replicate. ”

Everyone’s Aura was obvious.

“Hearing this, everyone’s gaze shifted to Feng Xianxian. ”

That’s right.

“In front of Ye Zhuo, the real daughter, what was Feng Xianxian, an outsider? ”

What right did she have to call herself her sister in front of Ye Zhuo?

In court drama.

Only a concubine with a high position was qualified to be called elder sister.

“In fact, Feng Xianxian’s meaning was very clear. ”

“She wanted to express to everyone that she was the only young miss of the Lin family, and Ye Zhuo couldn’t even compare to her little finger. ”

Who would have thought that.

Ye Zhuo would say these words openly.

What was the difference between this and public humiliation?

Feng Xianxian clenched her hands into fists and her entire body trembled. She was so angry that her face turned pale.

She did it on purpose.

Ye Zao did it on purpose.

“She clearly knew her name, but she pretended not to know her and insulted her with the name ‘that young lady of the Lin Family’! ”

“If it wasn’t for ye Zao, she would already be the young lady of the Lin Family! ”

What was ye Zao?

She was just a clown who stole from others.

An extremely disgusting clown.

“Old Lady Lin couldn’t bear to see Feng Qianxian suffer, so she turned to look at Ye Zao. “Qianxian is like my biological granddaughter, why can’t She Be Your Sister?” ”

“She really had no manners at all! Ye Shu, this SL * t, how did she usually teach her daughter! ”

She actually taught this wild girl to be like this!

“Ye Zao smiled faintly, “Grandma, I know that you really like this Missy who you don’t know! But you’re not biased like this. Everyone knows that my brother and I are twins. This Missy who doesn’t know who calls my brother Brother Brother Ah Ze. There’s no reason for her to become my sister? If this were to be known to others, they would think that this Missy who doesn’t know who she is has ulterior motives!” ”

Ye Zao’s words had a profound meaning.

The people at the banquet instantly understood.

“Feng Xianxian was obviously younger than ye Zao, yet she kept calling him sister. wasn’t she provoking ye Zao? ”

She thought that ye Zao didn’t know anything.

“In fact, ye Zao saw through her little thoughts. ”

Old Lady Lin was stunned.

She didn’t think that ye Zao would dare to Talk Back.

No rules!

This wild girl was really too unruly.

Did she still have a grandmother in her eyes?

“However, ye Zao kept calling her ‘grandmother’and ‘You’. He used honorifics, and old Mrs. Lin couldn’t find any mistakes at all. ”

It wasn’t good for her to flare up in front of everyone at the banquet.

“After all, it was the Lin family who lost face. ”

Just wait.

She would have plenty of time to deal with this wild girl!
