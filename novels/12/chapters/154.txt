Qian Dabao’s expression changed. “I hope teacher Jiang can still be so proud during the college entrance examination.”

There was a 20% chance of cheating during normal exams.

There was no chance of cheating during the college entrance examination. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The examination venue was very strict. It was so strict that not even a fly could fly in. When the time came, Ye Zhuo would definitely reveal his true form.

Now that he did not have any evidence, he could not say anything as a teacher.

Hearing the hidden meaning behind Qian Dabao’s words, Jiang Wenhui’s expression instantly changed. He immediately took out his specialty and began to speak in reverse, “Yes, yes, yes. In the entire world, your classmate Han Lei is the best! If the others are better than him, then they are plagiarizing! “Yes, our classmate Ye Tong plagiarized. Not only did our classmate Ye Tong plagiarize, but he also plagiarized your classmate Han Lei’s!”

“Whether he plagiarized or not, we will know on the day of the College Entrance Exam!”Qian Dabao continued, “Anyway, let me put it this way. The top scorer in Yunjing City will definitely belong to our class Han Lei!”

There were a total of 256 high schools in Yunjing City. Not only did Han Lei get first place in the whole school every time, but his results also stood out among these 256 high schools.

The final exam questions were so difficult this time.

The total score was 750 points. None of the other schools could get 720 points, but Han Lei got 726 points. This was enough to prove Han Lei’s strength!

Jiang Wenhui slapped the table. “Then let me put it this way. The top scorer of this city is definitely our classmate, Ye!”

726 points was nothing!

Ye Zhuo got 743 points.

......

He was a few streets ahead of Han Lei.

“In Your Dreams!”Qian Dabao scoffed.

Jiang Wenhui did not back down. “You’re the one who’s in your dreams. Your whole family is in your dreams!”

Qian Dabao could not be bothered to say anything more to Jiang Wenhui.

In any case, it was true or false.

On the day of the college entrance examination, everything would reveal its true form.

...

After school at night.

Ye Zhuo brought Zhao Pingting and an Lizi to the ye family’s private restaurant to eat.

It was lunchtime.

The restaurant was packed. There was a long queue outside the three restaurants.

“Damn, your restaurant is doing so well! It’s even more exaggerated than what the Internet says!”An Lizi said.

Ye Zhuo held their hands. “Maybe it’s because there’s a big discount on the internet recently. Come with me.”

Zhao Pingting sniffed. “It smells so good! No wonder there are so many people here for a meal.”

At this moment.

An Lizi stopped in her tracks. Her eyes were filled with disbelief as she looked ahead.

To be precise, her gaze landed on a middle-aged man and woman who were standing in line.

The man’s hand was placed on the woman’s waist.

Their posture was intimate.

Although the woman looked old, she was dressed very fashionably. She stood on her tiptoes and kissed the man in front of her.

“Lizi, what are you looking at?”Ye Zhuo looked back in confusion.

Seeing that she did not have any reaction, Zhao pingting stretched out her hand and waved it in front of her eyes. “Lizi?”

Only then did an lizi come to her senses. It was as if she had lost her soul. “N-nothing.”

“Lizi, are you not feeling well?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“No, no.”An Lizi shook her head and smiled. “Let’s go eat quickly.”

“Are you really okay?”Ye Zhuo was a little worried.

“I’m fine.”

Seeing that she was unwilling to say more, ye Zhuo did not ask any more questions. He brought the two of them to the shop and greeted ye Shu.

Ye Shu was naturally very happy to see ye Zao bringing his two classmates to the restaurant for a meal. “Zao Zao, bring your classmates to the second floor. If you want to eat anything, send it to me on wechat.”

“Thank you, Auntie.”Zhao Pingting and an Lizi thanked Ye Shu.

Ye Shu smiled and said, “You’re welcome. You can go up quickly.”

The second floor was a resting area and was not open to the public.

The three of them had just reached the second floor when Zhao pingting said, “Zhuozhuo, Auntie is so pretty!”

Ye Shu was indeed very pretty.

Her figure was also very good.

She looked to be in her early thirties at most. People would believe that she was twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old.

Ye Zhuozhuo said arrogantly, “That’s right. Otherwise, why would I be so Pretty?”

Seeing that an Lizi was in a daze, ye Zhuozhuo continued, “Lizi, are you really alright?”

“I’m fine.”An Lizi shook her head.

Halfway through the meal, an Lizi suddenly put down her chopsticks. “Zao Zao, Pingting, I suddenly remembered that I still have something to do. I’ll go back first, you guys eat.”As she spoke, before ye Zao and Zhao Pingting could react.., she grabbed her school bag and ran far away.
