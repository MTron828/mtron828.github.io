“Okay.”Ye Zhuo clicked the mouse.

“The picture of the aircraft carrier was immediately magnified by ten times. The tightly shut cabin door slowly opened, and the interior structure of the aircraft carrier was presented to everyone. “This side is the arsenal and the defense system. This is the cockpit, and this is the emergency room...” ”

“After looking at the entire design of the aircraft carrier, the laboratory was silent. ”

After a long while.

“Dr. Millet slowly said, “Dr. YC, how do you plan to solve the fuel problem?” ”

Ye Zao switched to another picture. “Build an orbital fuel depot and a space supply station here. The aircraft carrier will detach itself after supplying fuel.”

Dr. Millet nodded and took a pen to write down ye Zao’s words in his notebook.

“Dr. Warne was still immersed in the aircraft carrier design just now. He then asked, “Isn’t that weapon depot too simple? The aircraft carrier is big and the target is big. It’s easy to be hit in the air!”Once hit.., all his efforts would be ruined. ”

“Ye Zao returned the picture to the page just now, “We will build a defensive net at the bottom of the aircraft carrier. Any weapon that is thrown over will bounce back! “In addition, this place can store three rockets, three small spaceships, and equipped with an upgraded version of the directed beam energy weapon! “So, you don’t have to worry about the defense system at all!” ”

Dr. Warne nodded.

“After understanding the overall structure of the aircraft carrier, ye Zao got someone to bring out the design proposal and distributed it to everyone. ”

“Everyone looked at the design proposal in their hands, and their eyes were filled with amazement. ”

This was a flawless design proposal!

“Dr. Warne pushed up his glasses. “Miss Ye, to be honest, how long is the estimated completion time in your mind?” ”

Ye Zao looked in the direction of the construction bunker. “One and a half years.”

Two years was just a conservative number.

“When ye Zao lived in that era, the space mothership was just a very ordinary aircraft. Under normal circumstances, it could be completed in two to three months. ”

But this world was still not the world she lived in.

One and a half years?

Dr. Warne looked at Ye Zao and could not help but gulp.

“Hearing this, everyone looked at ye Zao with a complicated expression. ”

“Seeing everyone like this.., ye Zao continued, “I know that a year and a half is a little too long for everyone, but there’s nothing we can do now. Many of the technologies are not mature yet, so we can only slowly explore them. If we can speed up the process, I’ll try my best to speed it up.” ”

Everyone had black question marks on their faces.

? ? ?

So Ye Zao still felt that a year and a half was too long?

“C country had been researching aircraft carriers for decades, but they had yet to develop anything. To Ye Zao, it only took a year and a half! ”

This was not the most important thing!

The most important thing was that ye Zao still felt that a year and a half was too long!

“Chen Hao gulped and looked at ye Zao. “Father Ye, are you an alien?” ”

He now suspected that Ye Zao was an alien!

“Ye Zao smiled faintly. “You could say that.”After all, she did not belong to this world. ”

“Chen Hao smiled and said, “Then which planet are you from?” ”

“”Earth.”Ye Zao’s eyes were serious, “But I live in a different dimension from you guys. In our dimension, the technology is much more advanced than here! “Most people travel in small aircraft. Twenty years ago, interstellar tourism was already developed. “However, there are pros and cons to everything. Because of overexploitation, the environment there is very bad! “Daily food and clothing are all replaced by disgusting nutrient fluids. So, when developing technological civilization, don’t forget to protect the environment.” ”

Chen Hao chuckled. “Father Ye! You’re still so convincing! I almost believed you!”

Ye Zhuo glanced at him. “I’m not joking with you.”

“Chen Hao continued, “Since you’re not from the same dimension as us, then why are you standing in front of us and talking to us now?” ”

“Because the end of science is theology.”It was precisely because the end of science was theology that she became ye Zhuo by chance.

“Thinking of this, ye Zao frowned slightly. ”

He didn’t know how ‘She’in the other world was now.

“Dr. Millet stood up and said, “Dr. YC, can you take us to the construction warehouse to have a look?” ”

“Sure.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

A group of people followed behind ye Zao and came to the construction warehouse.

“In the construction warehouse, everyone was busy. ”

“After the press conference, Lao Nie went back to his office. As soon as he sat down, someone knocked on the door. ”
