“Zhao Xueyin held back a breath. “Dad, JUST YOU WAIT! Sooner or later, I will make master five your son-in-law!” ”

Who was the most outstanding person in the financial world?

“Of course, it was the Chief Master Five of the HK consortium! ”

“The HK consortium was the top aristocratic family in the financial world, the number one consortium in the financial world, and the number one consortium in the world. ”

Master five was the founder of the HK consortium.

“Master five was a low-profile person. Although he was the founder of the HK consortium, he had never shown his face in front of the media. ”

Even Zhao Xueyin had never met master five of the HK consortium.

Some people said that master five was an old man who was over 50 years old. Some people even said that master five was an upright man in his 30s.

“However, these things were not important to Zhao Xueyin at all. ”

“As long as she could marry master five, it would be enough! ”

“Although the Shunxi Financial Group was ranked second in the financial world, it could only be ranked tenth in the world. Who knew how many streets it was left behind by HK. ”

If she could marry master five.

“Then, the entire financial world would belong to the Zhao family from now on! ”

“Father Zhao continued, “If you can really marry master five, I would naturally be 100% willing. But the question is, can master five take a fancy to you?” ”

No one could deny Zhao Xueyin’s excellence.

But master five was a figure standing at the top of the pyramid. What kind of woman had he not seen before?

Could he take a fancy to Zhao Xueyin?

“After saying that, Father Zhao seemed to have thought of something and continued, “A person with Master Five’s status would not be faithful to anyone, nor would he be wronged to marry anyone! Do you want to be played by others for free?” ”

Men were not like women.

“When a man reached the peak of no one, he did not need a woman at all. ”

“Sometimes, a woman was just a tool to solve physiological problems. ”

But a woman was different.

“No matter what, a woman had to rely on a man! ”

“Zhao Xue Yin was silent for a moment. “Dad, you don’t have to care about that! Anyway, the only person I want to marry is master five! Don’t tell me that in your eyes, your daughter, I, am just that kind of vulgar woman?” ”

“No matter how outstanding Master Five was, he was just a man! ”

She had plenty of ways to make master five fall for her.

Father Zhao narrowed his eyes and did not say anything.

“Zhao Xueyin continued, “I want to make a trip to the capital tomorrow. I might not be back until later. You are alone at home. Remember to take good care of yourself. If there are any problems, give me a call.” ”

Father Zhao nodded.

“Then I’ll go upstairs first.”

“Go.”

Zhao Xueyin turned around and walked upstairs.

“Just as she walked upstairs, she received a text message from the lawyer. [ don’t take uncle’s words to heart. ] ”

[ got it. ]

“[ by the way, I also found out that ye Zhuo participated in a variety show. ] ”

“Zhao Xueyin immediately replied, [ what’s his name? ] ”

[ village 2]

“Seeing the reply from the lawyer, Zhao Xueyin immediately turned on her computer and searched for village 2. ”

“I’m Ye From Chess Streamer Sitara YC. You Can Call Me Ye.”

The girl on the screen looked to be about eighteen or nineteen years old.

“She had red cheeks and white teeth, and her eyebrows and eyes were like a painting. ”

“Even though there was a screen between them, it could not block the powerful aura from her body. ”

Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes.

“Ye Zhuo was indeed ye Langhua’s granddaughter. When she saw her, Zhao Xueyin could already see ye Langhua, who had been shining brightly all those years ago. ”

But wasn’t ye Zhuo a doctor in the science and technology industry?

Why did she want to participate in variety shows?

Could it be that she wanted to enter the entertainment industry to act? Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Thinking of this, a glimmer flashed across Zhao Xueyin’s eyes. ”

Zhao Xueyin pressed fast forward the entire time and spent three hours to finish watching all 12 episodes of “Village 2.”.

“After reading “Village 2″, Zhao Xueyin read some documents and handed over the matters of the consortium before she went to bed. ”

Beijing.

Lin family.

“Ye Zhuo sat in front of the computer and drew a design for the whole night. When she looked at the time again, it was already past four in the morning. Ye Zhuo finished the last step and clicked save before going to bed. ”

“Although she slept very late last night, Ye Zhuo still woke up at seven the next morning. ”

“After waking up, she started running. ”

“An hour later, Ye Zhuo came to the restaurant to eat. ”

“”Grandma, Mom, Dad, brother, Good Morning.” ”

“Ye Langhua and ye Shu had just met, so ye Langhua was currently staying at the Lin family’s residence. ”

“Good Morning.”

“Ye Shu continued, “Zhuozhuo, do you want a bun or a sandwich?” ”

“”A sandwich will do.”Ye Zhuozhuo sat at the dining table, picked up a sandwich, and slowly ate it. The sandwich was a little dry. ”

Lin Ze thoughtfully handed ye Zhuozhuo a glass of milk.

“Ye Langhua looked at the two siblings, her eyes filled with relief. ”
