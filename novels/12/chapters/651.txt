How many times has this been?

“Ever since ye Zao came back, he had been snatching her things all the time! ”

Feng Xianxian couldn’t even count how many times this had happened.

Slut!

Ye Zao was a slut!

“Feng Xianxian clenched her fists tightly. Because she had used too much strength, her nails were deeply embedded in her skin and she was completely unaware of it. ”

“Seeing Feng Xianxian like this, Old Lady Lin’s heart ached terribly. “Xianxian, don’t worry. Grandma will help you find Master Yu in a while. There must be a reason behind this...” ”

They had clearly agreed to take Feng Xianxian as a disciple. How could they change her at the last minute?

And it was in front of so many people!

“There’s no need.”Feng Xianxian pretended to be strong and shook her head.

“Old Lady Lin sighed, “Grandma is here! Grandma will definitely not let you suffer!” ”

“”Grandma, thank you.”Feng Xianxian looked at Old Lady Lin. ”

“Silly Child!”

“Under everyone’s gaze, Ye Zao walked up the stage step by step. ”

“She originally thought that the teacher-apprentice banquet was just a formality, so she wore a simple white shirt, black tights, and a pair of small white shoes, forming a sharp contrast with the female guests in formal attire. ”

She did not expect the ceremony to be so formal!

“However, even though ye Zao’s clothes were simple, he had the bearing of a mountain. ”

It was incomparable.

“Below the stage, Liu Caiyi was also stunned. ”

“She originally thought that Master Yu’s new disciple was the Lin family’s chosen granddaughter, Feng Xianxian. She did not expect that the chosen granddaughter would turn into a biological granddaughter. ”

It seemed that the Lin family’s biological granddaughter still had some tricks up her sleeve.

She had actually used the underhand method to replace Li Zhuan.

Could an ordinary person do it?

Liu Caiyi picked up her cup and sipped her tea. She raised her eyebrows slightly.

Feng Xianxian had previously won first place in the Beijing calligraphy competition.

Liu Caiyi still had some impression of Feng Xianxian.

“Therefore, when she learned that Master Yu was going to take Feng Xianxian as his disciple, Liu Caiyi was not surprised. ”

That was because Feng Qianxian indeed had the ability to do so.

She did not expect that.

“In the end, this predetermined granddaughter could not be compared to her biological granddaughter. ”

Master Yu and the Lin family’s old lady had always been on good terms. This sudden change in the timing of taking in a disciple definitely had something to do with Old Lady Lin.

Master Yu was too old and muddle-headed after all. He took into account his past breakup with Ye Zao and did not consider whether ye Zao was qualified to be his disciple.

The literary world was full of talents.

“As Master Yu’s last disciple, if ye Zao did not have some ability, would he be able to convince the masses? ”

Wouldn’t he be smacking himself in the face then?

“Thinking of this, the curve of Liu Caiyi’s lips became even more obvious. ”

It looked like.

Another big show was about to begin in the literary world!

Ye Zao came to the stage and bowed to Master Yu. “Master.”

“”Okay.”Master Yu helped Ye Zao up and handed the jade pendant that belonged to his sect to Ye Zao. “This jade pendant, you and your eldest senior brother each have one. From now on, you will be Yu Jingshan’s last disciple.” ”

Ye Zao received the jade pendant with both hands.

“This was a crystal clear jade pendant that did not have any impurities. When it was placed on his palm, it actually gave off waves of warmth. One look and one could tell that it was not cheap. ”

“Master Yu patted ye Zao’s shoulder. “The green exceeds the blue and is better than the blue. Zao Zao, from now on, the glory of the literary world will depend on you.” ”

He did not know why.

Ye Zao suddenly felt as if he had fallen into a trap.

“At that time, they had only agreed to acknowledge her as their teacher. ”

Why was the glory of the literary world being handed over to her now?

“”Zao Zao, I believe that you will definitely be able to dazzle all of our eyes.”After saying that, master Yu brought ye Zao around the banquet hall and introduced some of the elders of the literary world to her. ” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“”This is President Zeng of the literary association, this is Master Zhou... and this is the vice president of the Chinese Arts Association, Liu Caiyi. Caiyi, this disciple of mine is about the same age as you! I’ll have to trouble you to take care of her in the future!” ”

“Liu Caiyi raised her glass and her gaze swept across Ye Zhuo’s face. “Master Yu, you must be joking. Your Beloved Disciple, Miss Ye, is obviously not an ordinary person. I should be the one asking Miss Ye to take care of her!” ”

“Miss Liu.”Ye Zhuo also raised his glass towards Liu Caiyi.

“I’ll drink to toast first.”Liu Caiyi downed the wine in her glass in one gulp.

Ye Zhuo also downed the strong wine in his glass in one gulp.

Feng Xianxian looked at Ye Zao who was standing in the crowd and her eyes were red with anger.

She should be the one recognized by Master Yu!

What right did ye Zao have?

Old Lady Lin also felt very uncomfortable.

How could she have expected such an accident to happen?

Master Yu took ye Zao around and recognized everyone before answering the chairman.

Old Lady Lin found an opportunity to call master Yu out.
