Cook?

She actually had the face to ask her to cook.

The anger in Mu Yourong’s heart was ignited at this moment. She directly snatched Shen Rong’s phone. “Stop playing!”

“”Yourong, what are you doing!”Shen Rong stood up angrily. “I’m about to win!” ”

“Mu yourong said angrily, “What Time Is it now? How can you still have the mood to play cards? Other than playing cards, what else can you do? You are simply not good enough to do anything!” ”

Having such a mother was worse than not having one!

Shen Rong was stunned.

This was the first time Mu Yourong had spoken to her like this.

Was she possessed?

“If she had not seen it with her own eyes, Shen Rong would not have believed that this person was her daughter. ”

“”Y-yourong, what’s wrong with you?” ”

“Mu Yourong immediately roared, “You still have the face to ask me what’s wrong! Let me tell you! The CEN family has not gone bankrupt! Cen Shaoqing is CEN fifth master! It’s all your fault! It’s all your fault! If it wasn’t for you, I would be the Cen family’s young Madam Now!” ”

Shen Rong was immediately stunned.

She did not expect things to turn out this way.

The CEN family did not go bankrupt!

“Moreover, Cen Shaoqing was CEN fifth master! ”

Why did this matter sound so mysterious?

“”Yourong, are you mistaken?”Shen Rong swallowed her saliva. ”

“I saw it with my own eyes! The Cen family going bankrupt was just a pretense! He just wanted to test you! I didn’t expect you to actually see through the cracks in the door! Who told you to break off the engagement!”

“Back then, not only did Shen Rong and soldier Mu insist on breaking off the engagement, they even took out 200,000 yuan to humiliate the Cen family! ” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“If Shen Rong and soldier Mu had not done these immoral things, Old Lady Cen would definitely not have such a deep misunderstanding of her! ”

It was all their fault!

“The more Mu Yourong thought about it, the angrier she got, and her entire body was trembling. ”

“It would have been fine if she had never had it, but she clearly had it! ”

It was the people around her who single-handedly destroyed her bright future!

This feeling was the same as when you won a lottery worth 10 billion but accidentally lost the lottery ticket.

Uncomfortable.

It was too uncomfortable!

“Hearing this, Shen Rong’s face didn’t show any expression. ”

“Even in her dreams, she never thought that the Cen family’s bankruptcy was fake, much less that the CEN family would come to test them. ”

It was truly too sinister!

“If she had known earlier that the CEN family was only testing their words, she would never have called off the engagement. ”

Did she regret it?

Of course she regretted it!

But was there any use in regretting it now?

“If she said it out loud, it would be water splashed out. ”

What was done could not be undone.

“Shen Rong raised her head to look at Mu Yourong and spoke with great difficulty, “Yourong, mother knows that your heart is hurting, and mother’s heart is also very hurting right now! “But back then, when you broke off the engagement with the Cen family, it couldn’t all be blamed on your father and me! “If you insist on not breaking off the engagement, can your father and I force you to break off the engagement?” ”

“In the end, Mu Yourong was also responsible for this matter. ”

“Back then, it was Mu Yourong who had despised the Cen family as a rundown household. ”

“When Mu Yourong heard these words, she felt even more upset. She felt as if she couldn’t breathe, and couldn’t contain her anger, “What do you mean by this? Do you mean that I want to break off the engagement? It was clearly you! It was you who forced me to break off the engagement! If it weren’t for you forcing me, I would have long been the Cen family’s young Madam!” ”

She had never despised the poor and loved the rich!

It was not her fault!

This was not her fault at all!

This was all their fault!

“”What are you talking about, child?”Shen Rong frowned, “I admit that your father and I are responsible for the annulment! But isn’t the biggest responsibility you? You were the one who initiated the annulment in the first place! I admit that I hate the poor and love the rich! Don’t you hate the poor and love the rich? You are my daughter. Your father and I can’t just stand by and watch you marry a poor and destitute family! Your father and I can only be considered as secondary responsibility for this matter! “And you have to take full responsibility! “How can you push all the responsibility onto your father and Me Now?” ”

“At this point.., shen Rong continued, “Besides, if you hadn’t agreed to break off the engagement and reached out to the CEN family, the Cen family would at most have disowned your father and me as in-laws! They wouldn’t disown you as their granddaughter-in-law! “Didn’t they test us just to see your character ”

“”But what about you? What did you do? Not only did you want to break off the engagement, you even slandered Zhou Xiang and Old Lady Cen! In the end, it was you who didn’t live up to expectations! It was you who made them feel cold in their hearts!” ”

Shen Rong’s words were very reasonable.

“If Mu Yourong had been unwilling to break off the engagement and had extended her hand to the Cen family, things would definitely not have gone to this extent. ”

“Shen Rong’s words seemed to have turned into a sharp sword, directly stripping away the layer of beauty draped over Mu Yourong’s body, revealing her darkest and most corrupt side in the air. ”
