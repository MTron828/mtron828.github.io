“At this moment, Madam Chen was already burning with anger. How could she remain calm? ”

The greatest glory of her life was to have two outstanding sons!

“But now, her youngest son was locked up in the detention center. In the future, he would be imprisoned for another ten years. This was simply the biggest stain in her life. ”

“Moreover, as a mother, who could watch her son being locked up in prison? ”

“”Quiet down for a moment? Don’t tell me that you can think of a solution just by being quiet for a moment?”Madam Chen said furiously, “You, the deputy governor, are just a decoration! You Can’t even save your own son! Tell me, what have I gained after following you for so many years!” ”

“Madam Chen kept on chattering, almost making one’s head spin. ”

“Chen Jinyan was already very angry, but when he heard Madam Chen’s words, he became even angrier, he said angrily, “Enough! A loving mother is a waste of a son! Can’t you look for the reason on yourself? Didn’t your son do anything wrong in this matter? A fly won’t bite a seamless egg!” ”

“As a father, Chen Jinyan also hoped that his son would be outstanding. However, Chen Jinyan was also very clear about Chen Yaosheng’s character. ”

He liked to play.

“It was fine under normal circumstances. If he was crazy, he would really be able to do anything. ”

“But Chen Jinyan never thought that one day, Chen Yaosheng would be sent to prison. ”

“”My Son?”Mrs. Chen pointed at Chen Jinyan and said, “Is yaosheng my son! It’s my fault for not teaching the father! Yaosheng has become like this. Can you, as a father, escape unscathed? Chen Jinyan, I have given my life to your Chen family and even gave birth to two sons for you. In the end, I am the source of evil, right?” ”

Mrs. Chen was really a little sad.

She never thought that Chen Jinyan would say such words.

“She married Chen Jinyan at the age of 23. From then on, she became a standard housewife. She treated her husband as her god and her son as her earth. She gave up what she loved and liked and gradually turned herself into a person that she hated. ”

Now?

“Not only did Chen Jinyan not appreciate her, he even pointed at her nose and criticized her! ”

He blamed her for not teaching her son well!

It was a huge joke!

“The more Mrs. Chen thought about it, the sadder she became. Tears almost burst out of her eyes, “Chen Jinyan, I gave up so much for you. Do you think that I don’t want to live a life that I like? I’m willing to stay at home all day and work hard for you and your son. In the end, I’ll still be despised by you... ... Now that Yaosheng is locked up, as a mother, can’t I even talk about it ? Chen Jinyan, in your heart, what am I ? Am I your Chen family’s nanny?” ”

“Hearing this, Chen Jinyan also felt a little guilty, he sighed and said, “Don’t think too much. I was just saying it casually. I’m also anxious about Yaosheng’s matter! I’m just like you. I Can’t wait to get Yaosheng back immediately. However, the situation is special now. I Can’t do anything about it!” ”

“At this point, Chen Jinyan paused and pulled Madam Chen into his embrace. “Don’t worry, Suzhi. I’ll do everything I can to get yaosheng back.” ”

“Hearing this, Madam Chen calmed down a little and nodded. “Okay.” ” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“At this moment, the sound of footsteps came from outside the door. ”

Madam Chen immediately wiped the tears off her face. “Who is it?”

“Mom.”Chen Yaojun walked in from outside the door.

“Chen Yaojun was Chen Yaosheng’s older brother. He was five years older than Chen Yaosheng, and he was also much more mature and steady than Chen Yaosheng. ”

“Compared to Chen Yaosheng, Chen Yaojun rarely caused his parents to worry. ”

“Sometimes, in comparison, Chen Jinyan regretted having a second child back then. ”

“If it weren’t for Chen Yaosheng, there wouldn’t have been so much trouble? ”

Madam Chen immediately smiled. “Yaojun is back.”

“”Yes.”Chen Yaojun nodded. Seeing that his parents didn’t look too good, he continued, “Is there a new problem with Yaosheng?” ”

“Madam Chen nodded. “The Bai family had already promised that they would let Bai Jingzhu close the case personally, but now, they have gone back on their word!” ”

“Have they brought up new conditions?”Chen Yaojun asked.

“Chen Jinyan sighed. “If they really brought up new conditions, your mother and I wouldn’t be in such a hurry! They just didn’t bring up any conditions and told us that there’s no room for negotiation.” ”

Chen Yaojun frowned.

They didn’t bring up any conditions?

Then what did the Bai family want?

“”The reason why Bai Jingshu set a trap for Yaosheng was to trap our family. Now that their goal has been achieved, it shouldn’t be like this!”At this point, Chen Yaojun paused, then, he said, “Unless they have other demands! Dad, Mom, don’t be anxious now. If the enemy doesn’t move, I Won’t move. The Bai family will definitely take the initiative to look for us.” ”
