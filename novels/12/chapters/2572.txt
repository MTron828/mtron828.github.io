Ye Zhuo reached out and pinched Cen Shaoqing’s waist.

“Cen Shaoqing did not Dodge. “Look, it’s another good addition.” ”

“HMM?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“”Baby, if you want to fight, you can fight. If you want to pinch, you can pinch. Wherever you point, you can hit.”CEN Shaoqing continued, “The leader told me to go east, and I definitely won’t Go West!” ”

“When did you become so oily!”

“This is called the transformation of love.”Cen Shaoqing clenched ye Zhuo’s hand tightly. “It’s self-taught.”

Ye Zhuo smiled.

“Cen Shaoqing looked to the other side and asked, “What kind of relatives are there? Why haven’t I seen them before?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing had seen most of the relatives of the Lin family, but he had seen many unfamiliar faces today. ”

“”I haven’t seen them either,”ye Zhuo said. “They should be fourth aunt’s relatives.” ”

Xia Xiaoman had a few relatives from her family who had settled down in the capital. She would definitely be there on a day like today.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “That man over there has already looked over here thirty-one times in the past ten minutes.” ”

“Ye Zao chuckled. “If you don’t look at him, how do you know that he’s looking at you?” ”

“”He’s not looking at me,”Cen Shaoqing continued. “He’s looking at you.” ”

These words were somewhat sour.

“”It’s not a big deal to look at him.”Ye Zao smiled and said, “Besides, he might be looking at other people. Don’t be so sensitive.” ”

“Men understand men the best.”Cen Shaoqing blocked in front of ye Zao.

“Zao Zao! Da Zao Zao!”

“At this moment, Zhao Pingting’s voice sounded in the air. ”

“Ye Zhuo looked back slightly and said with a smile, “Pingting!” ”

“Zhao Pingting first greeted Cen Shaoqing and then said, “Scorch, there are three short of one mahjong player over there. Do you want to go?” ”

“Mahjong?”Ye Zhuo hesitated.

Zhao Pingting seemed to have suddenly remembered something. “I forgot that you don’t know how to play mahjong. But doesn’t your boyfriend know how to play? Just let him teach you.”

“No problem.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and held ye Zao’s hand. “Let’s go play mahjong.”

There were already two people sitting at the mahjong table.

“One of them was third cousin-in-law, and the other was a young girl ye Zao didn’t know. ”

“”Third sister-in-law,”ye Zao greeted politely. ”

“Third cousin-in-law smiled and introduced, “This is Lizi’s cousin, Li Hang. Hang, this is Lizi’s cousin, Ye Zao. This is Zao’s fiancé, Cen Shaoqing.” ”

“”Hello.”Ye Zao said politely, “I’m Ye Zao.” ”

Cen Shaoqing.

“Li Hang’s birth was not ordinary. Naturally, he knew about Cen Shaoqing. ”

“However, the news of Cen Shaoqing’s proposal shocked the world. ”

What she did not expect was that she would see Cen Shaoqing in person today.

“In fact, Li Hang had always looked down on Xia Xiaoman. ”

“In the words of Li Hang’s mother, she was not a woman. ”

“If it was not for Xia Xiaoman, an Dongliang would not have died. ”

“The three of them were a good family, but Xia Xiaoman broke them up. ”

“An Lizi had her own biological father, but now, she came all the way to the capital to be his stepdaughter! ”

What was so good about being a stepdaughter!

“An Lizi was also a spineless person. Her father was killed by this woman, yet she still followed Xia Xiaoman out! ”

“If she were an Lizi, she would never acknowledge a mother like Xia Xiaoman in this lifetime! ”

“Li hang smiled and looked at Ye Zhuo. “Hello, Miss Ye. I’ve long heard of your name, Li Hang. Qihang.” ”

Qihang.

“Li Hang’s name was specially calculated by a master, so every time he introduced himself, Li Hang would emphasize on introducing his own name. ”

Many people praised her name for being beautiful and special.

“She was clearly a girl, but her name was extremely domineering. ”

“Third Cousin’s wife smiled and said, “We’re all on the same side. SIT, sit, sit!” ”

Ye Zhuo sat down. Cen Shaoqing brought a stool over and sat beside ye Zhuo.

“Seeing this, third cousin’s wife teased, “Shaoqing, why are you so worried about searing alone? Don’t worry, we promise not to bully little twelve!” ”

“Cen Shaoqing explained, “She doesn’t know how to play mahjong. Let me give her some pointers.” ”

“”Then you have to go easy on her,”third cousin sister-in-law said. ”

“CEN Shaoqing said modestly, “I don’t know how to play either. Just a little.” ”Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“If it were any other time, Cen Shaoqing would definitely give way if he played mahjong with his elders. ”

But today was different.

“Today, he was going to teach ye Zhuo. ”

“If he lost to three women in front of his girlfriend, then what face would he have left. ”

“So, the first round of Ye Zao ended. ”

Li hang raised his head and looked at ye Zao.

“Beautiful and bright, this was probably her first impression of ye Zao. ”

She was more eye-catching than on camera.
