“Ye Zao held the snake in her hand, its tail tightly wrapped around ye Zao’s arm, black and white. ”

It looked a little scary.

But there was no fear on her face. She was so calm that it was unbelievable. It was as if she was holding a rope instead of a snake.

“”Yezi, you’re really amazing!”Old Lady Cen gave ye Zao a thumbs up. As expected of the granddaughter-in-law she had chosen! ”

How many people could compare to her courage and skill?

Not to mention Mu Yourong!

Even a hundred mu yourong could not compare to a single finger of her granddaughter-in-law.

“When she thought of the regretful look on Mu Yourong’s face in the future, Old Lady Cen felt very happy. ”

She wished she could immediately announce to the world that ye Zao was her granddaughter-in-law.

What a pity.

Now was not the time.

She still had to wait.

Zhou Xiang was also stunned. Her eyes were filled with worship as she looked at ye Zao.

She had never expected that ye Zao was not even afraid of snakes!

“Originally, Old Madam Cen had arranged for other heroic acts to save the damsel in distress, but now it seemed that they were no longer needed. ”

This was because ye Zao did not need to be protected at all!

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Actually, there’s nothing to be afraid of about snakes. As the saying goes, if you hit a snake at its seven inches, as long as you pinch its seven inches, it won’t be able to bite you.” ”

“Where is the seven inches?”Zhou Xiang asked curiously.

“Ye Zao pinched the snake and walked to Zhou Xiang’s side. “Aunt Xiang, look, this is the seven inches of a snake. try pinching it.” ”

“”I, I don’t dare...”Zhou Xiang was so scared that she quickly hid behind old madam Cen. ”

Snakes were the most terrifying.

“Not only were their bodies covered in scales, but their bodies were also ice-cold, making one’s scalp go numb. ”

“”Don’t be afraid! Isn’t it just a snake? What’s there to be afraid of?”Old Madam Cen’s expression was calm, but she was actually panicking in her heart. She was so scared that her legs went soft. ”

“But in front of her daughter-in-law and granddaughter-in-law, she had to do a good job of showing her face. ”

She could not lose her dignity!

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Grandma Cen is right. Actually, snakes are not scary at all. Aunt Xiang, why don’t you give it a try?” ”

“I... I think I’ll pass.”Zhou Xiang had goosebumps all over her body.

“Cen Shaoqing stood at the side, holding a Buddhist bead in his hand. His expression was still the same. Perhaps even he himself had realized that a faint smile had unknowingly appeared in his eyes. ”

He had met many people in his life.

But someone like Ye Zhuo.

This was really the first time he had met someone like her.

She seemed to be fearless.

She knew how to fight.

She knew how to catch snakes.

She knew how to treat illnesses.

She knew how to play chess.

And she was also a big shot in technology.

She was like a mysterious treasure. No one knew what kind of surprises were hidden in her body!

“Not only was the cauliflower snake not poisonous, but it was also the natural enemy of rats. Therefore, Ye Zhuo set it free on the spot, “Let’s go quickly. Don’t scare people casually in the future. You’re lucky to have met me today. Otherwise, you would have turned into snake soup.” ” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The cauliflower snake had just been placed on the ground when it quickly crawled away.

Ye Zao clapped his hands and stood up.

“Zhou Xiang handed ye Zao a bottle of mineral water. “Zao Zao, drink some water.” ”

“”Thank you, Aunt Xiang.” ”

“After resting for a while, the four of them continued to walk up the mountain. ”

“In order to create a separate space for ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing to spend time with each other, when they were going down the mountain, old Mrs. Cen said, “Shaoqing, there’s a temple over there. Your mother and I are going to fulfill our wish. You and Yezi should go down the mountain first.” ”

“Zhou Xiang nodded. “Yes, you guys go down first.” ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Old Mrs. Cen turned to look at Ye Zhuo. “Yezi, you’re so amazing. On the way down the mountain, our Shaoqing will have to rely on you to take care of him.” ”

“Ye Zao was not modest either. He smiled and said, “Sure, no problem!” ”

Cen Shaoqing:”...”does he look like someone who needs to be taken care of?

“Thus, on the way down the mountain, the four-person line turned into a two-person line. ”

Cen Shaoqing and ye Zao walked one after the other.

“One was dressed in plain clothes, while the other was dressed in black and white pants. ”

It was a blend of classical and modern.

“Not only did it not seem out of place, it was also exceptionally eye-catching. ”

He did not go down the mountain by the same route.

The scenery is also different.

“Walking, ye Zao actually found Wild Raspberries in a bush. ”

This kind of raspberry is also known as Thorn bubble in the folk.

It tastes sour and sweet.

“At the time when ye Zao lived, because of the rapid development of science and technology, resulting in serious environmental pollution, many animals and plants have been on the verge of extinction. ”

Ye Zao once saw a raspberry when he was very young.

Then it was completely extinct.

Not to mention wild raspberries.

Usually even eating a strawberry is a luxury.

People’s daily meals are also replaced by tasteless nutrient solution.
