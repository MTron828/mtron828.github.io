Translator: 549690339

Lin Qingxuan was stunned. He never thought that Old Lady Lin would have such a big reaction.

There is no Xia Xiaoman. There is no Xia Xiaoman.

“To be born the son of man, how can he choose? ”

“At this moment, Lin Qingxuan was in a dilemma. ”

“As the son of man, he couldn’t do anything to his own mother. ”

“However, as Xia Xiaoman’s boyfriend, he could not abandon her. ”

“Lin Qingxuan looked at Old Lady Lin. “Mom, do you have to do this?” ”

“Old Lady Lin Sighed, “Qingxuan, you’re already in your forties this year. I hope you can be rational and not live in an illusion. I’ve walked more bridges than you’ve walked! I know who is suitable for you and who isn’t. Xia Xiaoman is already in her forties this year. Whether she can give birth is another matter. Most importantly, she still has a burden on her. Do you want to be a cheap father and raise a child for someone else?” ”

Old Lady Lin could not accept Lin Qingxuan raising a child that was not related to her in any way.

“Moreover, the most important thing in life was to get married and have children. If Xia Xiaoman could not have children, what was the meaning of Lin Qingxuan marrying her? ”

In conclusion.

Old Lady Lin Absolutely would not allow Lin Qingxuan to be together with Xia Xiaoman.

“”Mom, can you take it as I’m begging you?”Lin Qingxuan continued, “All these years, I have never asked you for anything. Right now, I only want to be together with Xiaoman. I Don’t care if Xiaoman can have children. Right now, I only want to be together with her! Moreover, Lizi doesn’t need me to support her. Xiaoman has her own business! Mom, I’m the one trying to hook up with Xiaoman Now!” ”

“In Lin Qingxuan’s eyes, he had always thought that he was trying to hook up with Xia Xiaoman. ”

Because Xia Xiaoman was different from him.

“He was born superior, but Xia Xiaoman was a real self-made person. ”

Everything that Xia Xiaoman had was earned by herself.

“Although he had known Xia Xiaoman for less than a year, Lin Qingxuan was very sure that Xia Xiaoman was the person he wanted to spend the rest of his life with. ”

“No matter what happened, he wanted to be with Xia Xiaoman. ”

Dating?

Lin Qingxuan was dating Xia Xiaoman?

Old Lady Lin thought that Lin Qingxuan must be crazy! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Otherwise, why would he say such nonsense! ”

The Lin family was a true noble family!

What was Xia Xiaoman?

Xia Xiaoman wasn’t even a stray cat or dog on the roadside.

“”No!”Old Lady Lin’s attitude was very firm, “Qingxuan, I’m stopping you two from getting together now. You might hate me for a while, but if I let you two get together, your hatred for me will last for a lifetime! There won’t be any good results if you two get together!” ”

Xia Xiaoman wasn’t even with Lin Qingxuan.

They weren’t from the same world either.

“If they really got together, Lin Qingxuan would regret it too. ”

“As a mother, she couldn’t let Lin Qingxuan do what she regretted. She had to protect her son and not let those bad women cheat him. ”

“It didn’t matter if Lin Qingxuan hated her now, because Lin Qingxuan would understand her one day. ”

“”Mom!”Lin Qingxuan bent his knees and knelt in front of old lady lin, “I beg you! Please help us!” ”

“He wanted to be with Xia Xiaoman, and he desperately wanted to get Old Lady Lin’s approval. ”

“Old Lady Lin didn’t expect Lin Qingxuan to suddenly kneel down, and she frowned. ”

“”Lin Qingxuan! Do you have any backbone! You actually knelt down for a woman! Don’t you know that men have gold under their knees?”Old Lady Lin was furious, “Let me tell you! I will never agree to let the two of you be together! Just give up on this idea!” ”

“Lin Qingxuan could kneel down for Xia Xiaoman today. If Xia Xiaoman entered the house in the future, would she still have the right to speak in this house? ”

Beauty was a disaster!

“Mom!”

“Old Lady Lin continued, “If you want me to agree to let the two of you be together, you’ll have to kill me! Think about it yourself!”After saying this, Old Lady Lin turned around and walked into the house. ”

“Lin Qingxuan knelt in the hall, alone and helpless. ”

“In a trance, he felt as if he had gone back more than twenty years. ”

The same helplessness.

“When Mrs Lin returned to the back room, she was still very angry. ”

“Sister-in-law Wang let her breathe, a little worried, he said, “I thought that by introducing Qingxuan to a few young girls, Qingxuan would change his mind. I didn’t expect that Qingxuan was determined to be with Xia Xiaoman. If not, old madam, please help them. If this goes on, I’m afraid something bad will happen...”. . .” ”

Wang Sao underestimated Lin Qingxuan’s affection after all.
