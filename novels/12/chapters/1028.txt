“Aunt Lang nodded, as if she suddenly remembered something, “Oh right, Yang Jiao, I still have some things to take care of. You stay at home and help me look after half a month. I’m going out for a while. If the situation becomes serious in half a month, you must call me and tell me!” ”

“”Okay, sister, go do your work quickly!”Yang Jiao did not suspect anything. ”

“After saying goodbye to Yang Jiao, Auntie Lang returned to her room, took the documents with her, and left in a hurry. ”

“Just as she left, Auntie Lang called Elder Zhang. ”

“Hearing elder Zhang’s voice, Auntie Lang was instantly devastated. “Elder, elder Zhang...”if she had listened to elder Zhang’s words earlier, things would not have turned out this way. ”

“”Lang Hua, what’s the matter?”Elder Zhang asked. ”

“Auntie Lang said in a stifled voice, “Elder Zhang, I’ve looked through the information you gave me! I know everything now. I’m sorry, I misunderstood you before. Ye Shu is my half a month, I shouldn’t have disobeyed you...” ”

“When he heard this, elder Zhang was overjoyed. ”

He was really afraid that ye Lang Hua would never be able to see Xi Muwen’s true colors and would continue to be wrong.

Elder Zhang was very excited that ye Langhua could wake up.

“Then, Aunt Lang continued, “Where Are You Now? I’m here to look for you!” ”

“Elder Zhang continued, “I’m still at the hotel.” ”

“”Okay, then I’ll come over right away.” ”

Aunt Lang hung up the phone and looked up at the driver. “Go to the Wood Forest Hotel!”

“Okay.”The driver nodded.

The speed of the car was very fast and they arrived at the wood forest hotel in half an hour.

Aunt Lang had just gotten out of the car when she saw elder Zhang and Cao Wei waiting at the entrance of the hotel.

“Aunt Lang is here!”Cao Wei said excitedly.

“Elder Zhang nodded. “It’s her! It’s Lang Hua! Come, let’s go quickly!” ”

The two of them immediately walked in Aunt Lang’s direction.

“When she saw elder Zhang, Aunt Lang immediately knelt down and said with red eyes, “Elder Zhang! It was all my fault before. I misunderstood you!” ”

“Elder Zhang was shocked and immediately helped Aunt Lang up. “Quickly get up! Quickly get up! You Child, what are you doing!” ”

“”Elder Zhang, I’ve let you down...” ”

Elder Zhang Sighed. “Everyone makes mistakes! It’s not too late for you to turn back now that you know the truth!”

“Aunt Lang’s face was full of tears. “Elder Zhang, thank you! Can you take me to meet Little Half Moon Now?” ”

“Sure.”Elder Zhang nodded.

“Then let’s go quickly!”Aunt Lang couldn’t wait to fly to Ye Shu’s side.

“Cao Wei said, “I’ll go get the car! Elder Zhang, wait for me here with Aunt Lang.” ”

“Go.”

Cao Wei went to get the car.

“Not long after, Cao Wei drove over. ”

Elder Zhang and Aunt Lang got into the car.

“The car was very fast, and they arrived at the Lin family manor in a short while. ”

At the Lin Family Manor.

“When she heard that Aunt Lang had come, Old Lady Lin was very puzzled. Ye Langhua had clearly not believed that ye Shu had come half a month ago. ”

Why had she suddenly come now?

Could it be that something had happened?

Old Lady Lin turned to look at Auntie Wang. “You didn’t see wrongly. Is it really ye Langhua?”

Auntie Wang nodded. “It’s absolutely true. There’s no way I could have seen wrongly.”

Old Lady Lin was a little worried. She was worried that ye Langhua was here to cause trouble for ye Shu. “Push me to the east courtyard.”

“Okay.” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Just as Auntie Wang pushed Old Lady Lin to the east courtyard, she saw elder Zhang, Auntie Lang, and Cao Wei walking in. ”

“The moment Auntie Lang stepped into the east courtyard, she saw the courtyard filled with Lily of the valley orchids. ”

A familiar fragrance instantly filled her nostrils.

Aunt Lang’s emotions burst at this moment.

“Right now, she only hated herself for not listening to elder Zhang earlier. ”

Wasting so much time.

“Lang Hua!”Old Lady Lin called out to Ye Lang Hua.

“Elder sister.”Ye Lang Hua turned around and looked at Old Lady Lin with a face full of guilt.

“Old Lady Lin continued to ask, “Have you read that information?” ”

“Ye Langhua nodded and said in a raspy voice, “I’ve seen it! I’ve seen it all! Ah Shu is only half a month old. I’ve let the child down...” ”

Old Lady Lin heaved a sigh of relief. “It’s good that you know! Then quickly go in! Ah Shu is inside!”

It was not easy for them to be separated for so many years!

“From a mother’s perspective, Old Lady Lin could understand ye Langhua. ”

“When ye Shu heard the sound, she walked out and saw this scene. ”

“Although she had only met Aunt Lang once, the old lady’s appearance was deeply imprinted in her mind. ”

“However, what happened today was too sudden for ye Shu. ”

It was as if she was dreaming.
