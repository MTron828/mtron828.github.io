“Autumn flute instructed, “Your vision isn’t good at night. Be careful.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Lan walked onto the aircraft.

Autumn flute watched the aircraft disappear into the night sky before walking back.

Autumn flute had just walked to the door of the office when autumn town walked out from the side. “What’s up with that ye Lan? Is she waiting for an opportunity to take revenge?”

“Just her?”Qiu Di sneered. “Does she have that kind of brain?”

“If ye Lan had half a brain, she wouldn’t be so gullible. ”

“What do you mean?”Qiu Changzhen frowned slightly. He felt that Qiu Di was a bit hasty.

Qiu Di picked up the Phoenix Robe in the box. “What do you think this is?”

“Qiu Changzhen said incredulously, “A hundred birds pay homage to the Phoenix! Isn’t this the phoenix robe that ye Zao wore when he took over?” ”

“Yes.”Qiu Di nodded.

“Qiu Changzhen said in disbelief, “Did ye Lan just send this over?” ”

“”Yes.”Qiu di continued, “Father, you don’t have to worry about other things. Next, you just have to focus on how your daughter, I, managed to get to that position step by step!” ”

“Qiu Changzhen nodded. “Di’er, as long as you know everything in your heart! I Won’t say anything more.” ”

On the other side.

Ye Zhuo was the person who understood ye Han the most.

“After Yi Ling lured Ye Han out, she used knockout incense to knock him out and modified the surveillance system on his body. ”

“It was best that after all this, Ye Zhuo took out the antidote made from the purple leaf flower and fed it into ye Han’s mouth. ”

“Yi Ling looked at ye Zhuo from the side. “Great burning, is this really okay?” ”

“En.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Then why is Ye Xiaohan still not awake?”Yi Ling asked curiously.

“We still have to wait a little longer. Let’s go back first.”Ye Zao stood up from the ground.

“Yi Ling asked curiously, “Where are we going? What about Ye Xiaohan?” ”

“We still have other matters to attend to. Ye Han won’t be able to recover in a short period of time. It’s useless to wait here.”Ye Zao’s tone was indifferent.

“Then when will he wake up?”Yi Ling was very concerned about Ye Han.

She couldn’t wait for Ye Han to wake up immediately and dismember that autumn flute into pieces!

“That woman, autumn flute, was really too bad! ”

“”It mainly depends on willpower. It Won’t be more than three days at the latest,”ye Zao said. ”

“Hearing this, Yi Ling widened her eyes in surprise. “Three days! Does that mean that ye Xiaohan has to sleep here for three days before he wakes up?” ”

“Ye Zhuo explained, “Ye Han will wake up soon, but it will take some time for him to regain consciousness. So we have to leave before ye Han and Xi Lu arrive.” ”

“OH.”Yi Ling nodded and followed ye Zhuo’s footsteps.

“Just as ye Zhuo stepped onto the aircraft, he received a message. ”

It was from Sun Xiaoqian.

“Seeing this, Ye Zhuo frowned slightly. ”

Sixth Elder.

She did not expect that the seemingly aloof sixth elder was actually one of them.

“Seeing that her expression was not right, Yi Ling asked, “Big Zao, What’s Wrong? Has Sun Xiaoqian found out who the traitor is?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Who is it?”Yi Ling asked.

“Sixth Elder.”

“”Sixth Elder!”Obviously, Yi Ling also did not expect that it would be sixth elder. Her eyes were filled with disbelief. “How, how could it be him!” ”

“In Yi Ling’s impression, the sixth elder had always been a very kind and amiable little old man. When he had nothing to do, he always liked to bring it good food. ”

It was hard for her to accept the sudden news.

How could it be the sixth elder!

“I’m also very curious.”Ye Zhuo’s face was expressionless. “What made him walk this path?”

“He was also poisoned by a Gu?”Yi Ling asked.

Ye Zhuo shook his head slightly.

“She had already met the eight great elders in secret, but they showed no signs of being poisoned by a Gu. ”

...

The next morning.

“Ye Lan brought the seal and other documents to the Qiu residence, intending to officially hand over the Ye clan’s base to Qiu Di. ”

She had just walked out of the base’s entrance when she was stopped by someone.

“Ye Lan! You Can’t Leave!”

The person who stopped her was none other than Granny Fei.

Ye Lan frowned slightly. “I don’t want to make things difficult for you since you’ve raised me before. Please look at your own identity. Don’t embarrass yourself again and again!”

“”Ye Lan, are you going to look for Qiu Di? Are you going to hand over the management rights of the base to her?”Granny Fei asked. ”

“This has nothing to do with you!”Said ye Lan.

“Granny Fei looked at Ye Lan, she said bitterly, “You’ve been deceived! Ye Lan, you’ve really been deceived by Qiu Di! You’re not some direct princess of Manxing Kingdom at all! Can’t you see that? Her purpose in doing this is to obtain the management rights of the base!” ”

The corners of Ye Lan’s mouth curled up slightly. “Do you think I’ll still believe you now that things have come to this?”
