Zhou cuihua was very confident in the detective.

“Soon, the car arrived at the residential area. ”

“As soon as they reached the parking space, Li Hang said, “My dad is back.” ”

Li Da Long had been on a business trip all year round and only spent a third of his time at home. Li hang was quite surprised to see Li Da Long’s car in the parking space at this time.

“Normally, Zhou Cui Hua would be very excited when she heard the news of her husband’s return. ”

But not today.

“After all, she had already seen someone else’s more outstanding husband. ”

“At this time, Li Da Long was nothing but a useless man in her eyes. ”

“He had worked hard for so many years, but he was not even half as rich as Lin Qingxuan. ”

What else could this kind of man be if he was not a useless man?

“So what if you’re back!”Zhou cuihua said.

The mother and daughter returned home together.

“Just as they pushed the door open, they saw Li da long lying on the sofa. When he saw the mother and daughter return home, he said, “You’re back. I brought gifts for both of you. Hurry up and go get them.” ”

“”Thank you, Dad.”Li hang poured a glass of water for Li da long. “It’s been tough on you when you’re out on business!” ”

“Li Da long smiled and said, “No wonder people say that daughters are Daddy’s little cotton-padded jacket!” ”

Zhou Cui Hua placed the wine on the table.

“Li Da Long noticed her actions and asked curiously, “Why are you touching my wine all of a Sudden?” ”

“Usually, Li da long treasured his wine so much that he wouldn’t let anyone touch it. When he saw Zhou Cui Hua touching his wine, he couldn’t help but feel a little strange. ”

“It’s just a lousy bottle of wine. How can I not touch it?”Zhou cuihua turned around and said.

“Li Dalong said, “What’s wrong with you? You’re so Rude!” ”

“Zhou cuihua looked at Li Dalong and the more she looked at him, the more she disliked him. It was fine if this man didn’t have money, but he wasn’t even as handsome as Lin Qingxuan! ”

He was middle-aged and had a bald head and a beer belly!

He was a completely different person from Lin Qingxuan! Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

He couldn’t be compared to her!

“The more Zhou Cuihua looked at Li Dalong, the more uncomfortable she felt. She continued, “I’m just like that. If you don’t want to live with me, you can find someone else!” ”

Only a man with no ability would despise his wife.

A man like Lin Qingxuan would feel sorry for his wife.

She was blind back then to marry a man like Li Dalong who had nothing.

Only Lin Qingxuan was worthy of her.

A man like Li da long should be worthy of Xia Xiaoman.

What a joke!

“Li Da Long felt that his wife was a little strange. He turned to look at Li Hang and said in a low voice, “Daughter, what happened to your mother? Did she eat gunpowder?” ”

Li hang shook his head. “I’m not too sure either.”

“Even if he was sure, he could not say it. ”

“Li da long continued, “Is your mother going through menopause soon?” ”

It was said that women who went through menopause were not to be trifled with. It looked like it was true.

“After all, Zhou Cui Hua was usually a very gentle person. ”

“Li hang said, “More or less.” ”

“Li Da long smiled and said, “Fortunately, your mother’s menopause did not hit your puberty. Then our family will not be able to live on!” ”

“Speaking up to this point, Li da long stood up from the sofa and continued, “Alright, I’ll go and make some food for myself! I’ll do it myself. I’ll make enough food and clothes for you!” ”

“Li hang stood up and said, “Dad, what do you want to eat? I’ll go and make it for you.” ”

“Li Da long smiled and said, “My Daughter is still the best! You can just make a bowl of egg fried rice for Dad.” ”

“Okay.”Li hang walked towards the kitchen.

“Although she also felt that Li Da Long was not as capable as Lin Jin Cheng, Li Da Long was still her biological father. ”

The blood of the Li family flowed in her bones.

“No matter how Zhou Cui Hua looked at Li da long now, she felt that he was not pleasing to the eye. She kept asking herself in her heart, why did she find such a thing in the first place! ”

She was so good-looking. What kind of person did she want to marry back then?

“Zhou cuihua continued, “When will you leave after you come back this time?” ”

“”I don’t know the exact time. Let’s see the notice.”Li dalong continued, “But I might be at home during this period of time.” ”

“Hearing this, Zhou Cuihua was even more unhappy. ”

“After all, she felt annoyed whenever she saw Li Dalong now. ”

Zhou Cuihua didn’t say anything else. She walked into the bedroom and closed the door with a bang.

The force was so strong that even Li Dalong trembled.

“Is this woman crazy?”Li Dalong scratched the back of his head.

“Not long after, Li Hang placed the egg-fried rice on the table. “Dad, it’s time to eat.” ”

“”I’m Coming, I’m Coming!”Li Dalong stood up and walked into the restaurant. “My Daughter is still the best. She knows how to care for others, but I don’t know which family will benefit from her in the future! Oh right, Hang Hang, have you fallen in love recently?” ”
