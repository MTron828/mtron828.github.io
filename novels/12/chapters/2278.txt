“Zhou Ying was very upset. She gritted her teeth and said, “I don’t know who was the one who secretly informed the old man! If I find out, I will skin him alive!” ”

“Bai Jingfei walked in from the door and heard this sentence. She was so scared that her heart skipped a beat. However, she quickly adjusted her emotions and walked in. She asked in confusion, “What happened to mom and Dad? Why are you guys so sad?” ”

“Where did you go just now?”Zhou Ying looked up at Bai Jingfei and narrowed her eyes. “Were you the one who tipped off your grandfather?”

Only the Bai family knew about this.

Who else could it be other than Bai Jingfei?

“”What tipped off? Mom, why can’t I understand what you’re saying?” ”

Zhou Ying raised her hand and was about to hit Bai Jingfei. “You traitorous B * tch...”

Bai Jiasheng held her hand. “Jingfei has nothing to do with this. Why are you venting your anger on her?”

“Bai Jingfei had been at odds with Bai Jingshu since she was a child. She often mocked Bai Jingshu, so how could Bai Jingfei inform Old Master Bai? ”

“A glimmer flashed in Bai Jingfei’s eyes. “Father, grandfather came?” ”

“”Yes.”Bai jiasheng nodded and continued, “There’s nothing for you to do here. You can go back to your room!” ”

“Bai Jingfei’s face immediately fell, “Does that mean that Chen Yaosheng can’t become my brother-in-law?”? “What is this idiot Bai Jingshu thinking! ?”! “Father, mother, don’t worry. I will never learn from her in the future! “I will listen to your words and glorify the Bai Family!” ”

“When he heard this, a smile appeared on Bai Jiasheng’s face. “Good Boy!” ”

“At this moment, a servant came in from outside. “Sir and Madam, the Chen family has sent someone over.” ”

“If it was any other day, Bai Jiasheng would definitely be very happy. However, today, he could not be happy. “Tell him to wait for me in the main hall.” ”

“Alright.”The servant nodded and walked out.

“Soon, Bai Jiasheng came to the main hall. ”

“Butler Wang immediately stood up from his chair. “Mr. Bai, the three days are up. I wonder what you mean now?” ”

“Bai Jiasheng hesitated, then he said, “Butler Wang, please apologize to master Chen on my behalf. My Daughter’s temper is too fierce. I starved her for three days, but she refused. She is my biological daughter. I can never starve her to death!” ”

“Upon hearing this, Butler Wang was unhappy. “Mr. Bai, do you mean that you don’t agree with our master’s plan?” ”

“Bai jiasheng said, “It’s not that I don’t agree. I also want to marry the Cheng family into the Qin and Jin dynasties. We can turn hostility into amity. But on my daughter’s side...” ”

“At the end of his speech, Bai Jiasheng sighed. His face was full of distress. ”

“He was truly troubled now. The Chen family was already the little fat duck in his mouth, but now, the little fat duck had flown away! ”

“Butler Wang looked at Bai Jiasheng. “Mr. Bai, our family head said that as long as he can bail out our second young master, he will agree to whatever conditions you put forward!” ”

“”It’s not a matter of conditions now. Butler Wang, I’m also very helpless.”Bai jiasheng continued, “I’ll have to trouble you to tell Patriarch Chen the truth! I really have no other choice!” ”

Butler Wang frowned. “Is there no room for discussion?”

Bai Jiasheng shook his head.

Butler Wang returned to the Chen family with the news.

Chen Jinyan did not think much of it when he heard the news. Madam Chen had casually smashed an antique vase.

The Bai family was really too much!

Chen Jinyan looked at Butler Wang. “Did he really say that? Is there no room for negotiation?” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Butler Wang shook his head.

“Madam Chen’s eyes were red as she said, “Are we really going to let Yaosheng go to jail?” ”

Chen Jinyan did not say anything.

“That’s ten years! Quickly think of a way!”

“Ten years later, Chen Yaosheng would really be a cripple! ”

“Chen Jinyan continued, “A new official is always in trouble. Unless Bai Jingshu takes the initiative to go to the police station to close the case, Yaosheng will not be able to come out.” ”

“Cen Haifeng abdicated. Although CEN Shaoqing did not officially take over the General Alliance, the person in charge of the general alliance was CEN Shaoqing’s trusted aide. ”

“”What about Yaosheng? He is your biological son!”Madam Chen cursed again. “That little B * Tch Bai Jingshu will die a horrible death! What does she want? ! Isn’t she just thinking of marrying into our Chen Family? I’ve already promised her, what else does she want?” ”

“Chen Jinyan had a headache. He rubbed his temples and said, “Let me be quiet for a while.” ”
