Chapter 2686: 594: just buy a villa

Translator: 549690339

Ye Shu nodded. “Sure.”

“After saying that, Ye Shu continued to ask, “SIS, what kind of house are you planning to buy?” ”

“Ye Sui smiled and said, “It doesn’t need to be too good. Just buy a villa.” ”

Just buy a villa.

“If outsiders heard this, they would think that ye Sui was some billionaire! ”

“The capital was not like other places. A random villa would cost tens of millions, hundreds of millions. ”

“Ye Shu continued, “Are you guys done packing? If you’re done packing, you can set off now.” ”

“”Let’s go, let’s go.”Ye Sui was full of smiles and was pleased with himself. ”

“After saying that, ye Sui looked at Zhou Ziyue behind him and urged, “Ziyue, what are you doing? Let’s Go!” ”

“”I’m Coming, I’m Coming.”Zhou Ziyue immediately followed the two of them. ”

They walked out of the door.

The sun was very high today.

“Ye Shu walked in front. Ye Sui saw that ye Shu didn’t sweat at all and asked curiously, “Little Shu, aren’t You Hot?” ”

“”I’m fine,”ye Shu answered. ”

“Zhou ziyue continued, “Is aunt wearing an air-conditioned jacket?” ”

Air-conditioned clothes!

“Upon hearing this term, ye Sui’s eyes instantly lit up. ”

“Although air-conditioned clothes were popular now and the price was not very expensive, there were too many people who needed them. Every time they were released, the normal version would be snapped up by others. The remaining ones were all high-end ones. ”

High-end ones were too expensive and ordinary people could not afford them.

Ye Shu nodded. “Yes.”

“Ye Sui continued, “Little Shu, where did you buy your air-conditioning clothes?” ”

“”On the official website,”ye Shu said. ”

“Ye Sui continued, “Actually, we’ve wanted to buy this air-conditioning clothes for a long time, but we haven’t been able to get them...” ”

The meaning of this sentence was very obvious.

“Ye Shu knew what she meant and continued, “I just happen to have two pieces that haven’t been worn yet. I’ll go back and get them for you later.” ”

“Their figures were about the same, so she could wear the clothes that ye Shu was wearing. Damn ”

“Hearing this, ye Sui smiled and said, “Okay, okay, okay! Since you can’t wear them anyway, why don’t you give them to me!” ”

“As soon as he finished speaking, ye Sui continued, “Then is there anything your burning Jade doesn’t Wear?” ”

“What’s Wrong?”Ye Shu asked.

“Ye Sui said, “Only I have it, but our Ziyue doesn’t have it yet! If your burning jade has anything that she doesn’t wear, ask her to give two pieces to Ziyue as well.” ”

“”I’ll ask her when I go back.”Ye Shu continued, “Oh right, when do you plan to go back? I’ll get the housekeeper to buy the plane tickets.” ”

Go Back?

Ye Shu was sending her back just like that?

She was not going back!

“Ye Sui said, “After we settle the matters of the house, we’ll settle down in Beijing.” ”

“After saying that, ye Sui said again, “Little Shu, is brother-in-law’s company very big?” ”

“”It’s average,”ye Shu said. ”

“Ye Sui smiled and said, “Little Shu, I’m not an outsider. Is there anything you can’t tell me? I know brother-in-law is very capable.”At this point, ye Sui paused and continued, “Oh right, Little Shu, I want to discuss something with you.” ”

“”Go Ahead,”ye Shu said. ”

“Ye Sui continued, “I plan to get your brother-in-law and Libang to come over after I buy the villa. After Libang graduated from university, he hasn’t been able to find a good company. I was wondering if you could get brother-in-law to arrange for Libang to enter the company. Just arrange a general position for him.” ”

Any general position.

Ye Sui said this with ease.

“Ye Shu was already a little impatient. She originally wanted to not argue with ye Sui about the past, but not only did ye Sui not know what was good for him, he even took an inch and took a mile. ”

“What university did Libang graduate from?”Ye Shu asked.

“Speaking of this, Ye Sui’s face was full of pride. “Libang graduated from Linhai Vocational and technical school.” ”

Vocational and technical school.

“Ye Shu’s expression didn’t change much. She looked at ye Sui and continued, “The LIN Group’s employees are all at least undergraduates.” ”

Undergraduates?

“Hearing these four words, ye Sui instantly exploded. He continued, “Undergraduates? So what if I’m an undergraduate! Do you still discriminate against academic qualifications? What about yourself? You haven’t even finished junior high school. Do you have the nerve to discriminate against vocational majors?” ”

Ye Shu was really disgusted!

“She didn’t even have any academic qualifications, and she still had the face to despise Zhou Libang! ”

“Besides, so what if he was a vocational major? Couldn’t he be a boss if he was a vocational major? ”

“Ye Sui continued, “I’ve even seen people who haven’t graduated from primary school become a boss! Our family’s libang is still a vocational major after all!”Compared to people who hadn’t even graduated from primary school, Zhou Libang was already very outstanding! Why could people who didn’t graduate from primary school become bosses, but not Zhou Libang? ”

“Moreover, Ye Shu was Zhou Libang’s aunt! ”

“As his aunt, Ye Shu should help Zhou Libang! ”

“Ye Shu continued, “People who didn’t graduate from primary school can become bosses. They rely on their own strength.” ”

“Our Libang also has strength!”Ye Sui said.

“Ye Shu looked at ye Sui and asked in return, “His strength is based on connections?” ”

“Ye Sui was stunned for a moment, and then his face was full of a fawning smile, “Little Shu, as the saying goes, to be able to rely on connections is also a kind of strength! Who asked our libang to have a good aunt! Seeing that Libang is your only nephew, you help him! Actually, Libang entering your brother-in-law’s company is also a good thing for you!” ”

“At this point, ye Sui paused, then, he continued, “As the saying goes, a man will change when he has money. With libang around, he can at least help you keep an eye on your brother-in-law and prevent him from messing around outside! “I’m doing this for your own good. If it weren’t for my family, who would treat you so sincerely! “Little Shu, I’m telling you, this shop won’t exist after this!” ”

Ye Shu didn’t know what was good for her!

“If it were anyone else, who would be so kind! ”

Ye Shu looked at ye Sui. “I appreciate your kindness.”

“”Little Shu, what do you mean?”Ye Sui looked at Ye Shu, then, he said, “I’m telling you, you’re all here because of your brother-in-law. If one day, your brother-in-law is seduced by a little fairy who is younger than you, you’ll regret it before it’s Too Late!” ”

Ye Shu was now an old woman. What right did she have to compete with a little girl!

“”Sister, you worry too much! I know Jin City Better Than You,”ye Shu said. ”

“Ye Sui wanted to say something more, but at that moment, Zhou Ziyue quietly pulled on ye Sui’s sleeve. Ye Sui did not continue. ”

“Anyway, their family was going to settle in the capital. There would be plenty of opportunities like this in the future. ”

“Soon, they arrived at the scenic spot. ”

“Today, ye Sui bought a bunch of tourist souvenirs that she did not have to pay for herself. ”

“On her way back, she passed by the sales office. ”

The few of them walked towards the sales office.

“Ye Sui said generously, “Introduce me to the villa with the best layout on your side.” ”

“When the sales lady saw that ye Sui did not seem to lack money, she immediately smiled and greeted, “Hello, Madam. Please follow me over here.” ”

Ye Sui followed her.

“This was a villa facing the river. The surrounding environment was very good, and it was in the center of the city. It had a total of more than 3,000 square meters. ” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Ye Sui took a liking to it at a glance. He turned to look at Ye Shu. “Little Shu, what do you think?” ”

“”It’s Alright,”ye Shu said. ”

“Seeing that ye Shu nodded, ye Sui said to the sales lady, “Alright, this one then!” ”

“”Alright.”The sales lady smiled and said, “Follow me over here. Would you like to pay in full or as a down payment?” ”

“Of course I’ll pay in full!”Ye Sui said.

In full!

“Hearing this word, the sales lady’s eyes lit up. “Alright, Alright. Follow me over here and sign the contract first.” ”

Ye Sui followed her over.

Ye Shu stayed where she was. “You guys go ahead. I’ll sit here and rest.”

“After the contract was signed, the sales lady took out a credit card machine. “Madam, can I have your bank card?” ”

“Wait a moment.”Ye Sui looked at Zhou Ziyue. “Go and call your aunt over.”

“Okay.”Zhou Ziyue nodded and walked over to call ye Shu.

“When she arrived at the rest area, Ye Shu was no longer there. She only saw her assistant standing there. ”

“Zhou Ziyue immediately ran over and asked, “Where’s my aunt?” ”

“The assistant replied, “She’s too tired, so she went back first. She told me to wait for you guys here.” ”

“Zhou Ziyue nodded. “Alright, then come with me to swipe your card.” ”

“Swipe Your Card?”The assistant was stunned. “Swipe What Card?”

“Zhou ziyue said, “We have to pay.” ”

“These few days, they were the ones buying things in the front while the assistant followed behind to swipe their cards. ”

“The assistant continued, “Are you saying that you want to buy a villa for Madam to swipe her credit card?” ”

“Yes.”Zhou Ziyue nodded as if it was a matter of course.

“The assistant still could not react in time. He took out his phone and said, “Let me ask Madam.” ”

“After saying that, the assistant dialed Ye Shu’s number. After the call was connected, the assistant explained the matter briefly. He did not know what was said on the other end, but the assistant continued, “Alright, I understand.” ”

“After hanging up, Zhou ziyue continued, “Is it alright now?” ”

“The assistant looked at Zhou Ziyue. “Miss Zhou, I’m really sorry. Madam said that she doesn’t have the money to lend you guys for the time being.” ”

“Lend?”Zhou ziyue frowned.

“Yes.”

What was wrong with Ye Shu?

Didn’t she want to buy a house for their family?

She was so rich. Could it be that she cared about the money for a small villa?
