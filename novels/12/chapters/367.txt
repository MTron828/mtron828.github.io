“”It’s possible.”Zheng Yuanjie continued, “How about this, when the time comes, we’ll arrange for Big Boss and YR to sit together.” ”

“With YR’s qualifications, she naturally couldn’t sit together with a bunch of big bosses. ”

But who asked her to have a good father?

“Chu Zimo continued, “But YR might not be big boss’s daughter, it might also be big boss’s granddaughter!”Big Boss YC was so powerful, he was definitely older than Dr. Warne! ”

Zheng Yuanjie nodded slightly. “That does make sense.”

...

At the same time.

A video spread throughout the car racing world.

The background of the video was a driving school.

The driver’s car was also a coach’s car.

“As soon as the video appeared, the number of likes exceeded one million. ”

“This is too cool! I want to acknowledge him as my master!”A young man said excitedly after watching the video.

“Hearing this, a tattooed young man turned around and looked at him. “No Way, young master he! Take him as your master? Is it that exaggerated? Although his actions are extremely dangerous, in the eyes of us racers, it doesn’t seem that difficult, right?” ”

This young master he was called he ziteng.

“He ziteng was the heir of the He family in the capital city. His biggest hobby was racing cars. In the last race meeting, he defeated a professional racer and obtained a good result of first place. ”

He was called a new dark horse!

“But today, this new dark horse actually wanted to learn from someone else! ”

“He ziteng said, “Take a good look at what kind of car he is driving. If I gave you a coach car, would you be able to drive him like this?” ”

“Hearing this, the tattooed young man was stunned. ”

Yes.

He had overlooked one thing.

The person in the video was driving a car that didn’t have any functions.

“As everyone knew, not only did racing test one’s skills, it also required a very high standard of the car. ”

“There were some difficult moves that could not be completed without a professional racing car. However, the person in the video not only completed it, but also completed it beautifully! ”

This was not simple!

“Thinking of this, the tattooed youth swallowed his throat. “Young master he, then do you think he’s a man or a woman?” ”

“”It’s very likely a woman,”he ziteng said. ”

“How do you know?”The tattooed young man asked in surprise.

“He ziteng paused the phone screen and pointed at the rearview mirror. “Look here. Although the picture is very blurry, you can tell that it’s a woman’s silhouette.” ”

“The car window was half open, and the rearview mirror showed a blurry figure. ”

The tattooed youth narrowed his eyes. “Looks like song Chenyu is about to meet her match.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Song Chenyu was a big star in the entertainment industry.

“But she was also a racing driver, and her racing skills were very good. ”

“At the same time, Song Chenyu was also the only female star in the entertainment industry who had a seat in the racing industry. ”

“Many people not only ate song Chenyu’s face, but also her racing skills. ”

When a woman started racing.

It could simply be described as valiant and valiant.

“Therefore, song Chenyu’s status in the circle was very high. ”

She had over 100 million fans on various social media sites.

He ziteng shook his head. “Song Chenyu can’t be compared to her.”

“After saying that, he ziteng continued, “Can you find out who this person is?” ”

The tattooed youth shook his head. “I only know that this video was uploaded from a driving school in Yun Jing. Many people have reposted it. It might be difficult to find out who she is.”

He ziteng made a call and walked out with his phone. “Help me look up someone.”

“Who?”A pleasant male voice came from the other end of the phone screen.

“I’ve sent the video to you.”

“Okay.”

...

Time passed quickly.

“In the blink of an eye, it was the day before the science and Technology Conference. ”

Ye Zhuo took a plane to Beijing.

“As soon as he got off the plane, he received a wechat message from Chu Zimo. [ boss, have you arrived? ] ”

[ just got off the plane. ] Ye Zhuo pushed the suitcase with one hand and held his phone with the other.

“[ okay, I’ll wait for you at the airport. ] ”

“Chu Zimo held up a big sign and squeezed into the first row, his gaze locked onto the old man in the crowd. ”

“He was worried that YC boss could not walk, so he specially prepared a wheelchair. ”

“When the time came, he could sit in the wheelchair and push the boss to the parking lot. ”

“In addition to the wheelchair, he also prepared a crutch. ”

“In order to leave a good impression on the big boss, Chu Zimo even removed the ear studs from his ears. ”

This was because the older generation disliked these fancy things the most.

“Chu Zimo waited at the airport entrance for a long time, but he did not see an old man who fit the big boss’s image. ”

“Seeing that there were fewer and fewer people, Chu Zimo was anxious and kept stepping in the direction of the airport entrance. ”

“At this moment, a clear and shallow voice suddenly sounded in the air, “Hello, Are You Chu Zimo?” ”

“Chu Zimo turned around and saw a young woman with picturesque features standing in front of him, dragging a suitcase. ”

“She was wearing a black hoodie, with 3,000 black hair draped behind her head, red lips and white teeth. ”

She was wearing a pair of torn jeans and a pair of black Martin boots.

He looked extremely cool.

“”Yes, I am.”After a long while, Chu Zimo finally reacted to her beauty. ”

“Let’s go.”Ye Zhuo walked in front with his suitcase.

“Wait!”Chu Zimo scratched his head. “Do we know each other?”

“If it was any other time, Chu Zimo would not have missed such a beautiful woman. ”

But not today!

He was still waiting to receive the big boss!

“I forgot to introduce myself.”Ye Zhuo extended his hand towards him. “I’m Niu Hulu YC. Nice to meet you.”

“Chu Zimo was stunned. “Don’t, don’t joke around!” ”

Niu Hulu YC was clearly an old grandpa.

How could he be so young?
