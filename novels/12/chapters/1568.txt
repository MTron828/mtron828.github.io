“Chapter 1569: 238: After learning the truth, the entire Internet was furious. What happened to Zhang Qingqing! 2”

Translator: 549690339

“A poor adopted child and a rich adopted daughter. The two of US give Qingqing five figures of living expenses every month. Do you think that such a girl will be kept by someone else?”

“”Even if my daughter is kept by someone else, will that wash away Lin Ze? My Daughter is currently pregnant with Lin Ze’s Child!” ”

“”Wu Youyu is already dead. There’s no evidence to prove his innocence. Even if the living people tried to frame him, he wouldn’t be able to refute them.” ”

“But my daughter’s pregnancy is real! Lin Ze’s atrocities are also real!”

“”But now, everyone only saw those photos with unknown origins and ignored Lin Ze’s actions!” ”

“At the end of the video, Father Zhang was already crying his eyes out. ”

“The video lasted for a total of ten minutes. Father Zhang avoided the important points and made light of the important points. He pushed all the blame onto Lin Ze and described Lin Ze as an irresponsible scumbag. Meanwhile, Zhang Qingqing had suddenly become a victim from high-end green tea. ”

“The netizens, who had already seen through Zhang Qingqing’s true colors, switched sides again at this time. ”

“After all, only a few photos of Zhang Qingqing had been circulated. ”

“Who knew if those photos were real or fake? Just like what Father Zhang said, Lin Ze had raped Zhang Qingqing and caused her to get pregnant. ”

“”Actually, Father Zhang is quite right. No matter what kind of person Zhang Qingqing is, what Lin Ze did was real!” ”

“”Right, right, right! This time, I’m on the side of the Zhang Family!” ”

“[ sigh, I originally thought that Lin Ze was set up. Now, it seems that Lin Ze isn’t innocent at all! ] ” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“[ Lin Ze wasn’t innocent to begin with. The innocent ones are the parents of the Zhang Family! It’s one thing for his daughter to be harmed, but now he’s being blamed for no reason at all! ] ”

“[ actually, Father Zhang and mother Zhang aren’t having an easy time either. It can be seen that they are both people with a good view of the world! ] ”

“[ yes, Father Zhang and mother Zhang are indeed a good pair of parents! ] ”

[ supporting father Zhang and mother Zhang! ]

“[ yes, we all support father Zhang and mother Zhang! ] ”

“Looking at these comments, Zhang Qingqing felt a lot better. ”

“At least, the netizens were now on her side. ”

On the other side.

At the Lin family home.

“An Lizi had been staying in ye Zao’s room the whole time. Seeing the things that had already calmed down and being criticized by the parents of the Zhang family, everyone was once again on Zhang Qingqing’s side. They were extremely anxious. ”

“”Zao Zao, what should we do?”An Lizi turned around to look at ye Zao. ”

Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly.

There was only one way now.

That was to let Zhang Qingqing give birth to the child and then do a paternity test.

“Although this was the final method, it was not the best method. ”

“Even if the result of the paternity test showed that the child in Zhang Qingqing’s stomach was not Lin Ze’s, it would not be good for Lin Ze’s reputation. ”

“If Lin Ze had not done anything wrong, would he have gone for a paternity test? ”

“But if Lin Ze did not go for a paternity test, people would suspect that he was guilty and did not dare to go for a paternity test. ”

“In short, Lin Ze was in a dilemma. He could not take a step forward. ”

He could not take a step back.

Then.

What should he do now?

Ye Zhuo took out his phone and called Er Mao.

Er Mao quickly picked up. “Boss!”

“Ye Zhuo went straight to the point. “Er Mao, do you have anything from the surveillance cameras at the clubhouse that night?” ”

“Er Mao said, “No. The Chao Feng clubhouse forbids recording! But...” ”

“But what?”Ye Zhuo continued to ask.

“Er Mao continued, “I traced an ID. The other party runs that kind of website. He installed an invisible pinhole camera in room G1028. There should be something recorded in that camera! But he set the permissions. So far, I haven’t found a loophole. ”

Ye Zhuo’s beautiful eyes narrowed. “Send me the IP address.”

“Hearing this, Er Mao said somewhat excitedly, “Big Brother, are you going to make a move?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo’s tone was indifferent.

“Er Mao continued, “Then I’ll send it to you right away.” ”

“After hanging up, er Mao immediately sent the IP address to Ye Zhuo. ”

Eighty Mao ran in from outside. “Who did you say was going to make a move? Big Brother Z?”

“Yes.”Er Mao nodded.

“After ye Zhuo received er Mao’s message, he immediately turned on his computer. ”

“After all, the other party was a website owner, and the security measures were very good! ”

“Not to mention ordinary hackers, even top hackers would not be able to find a loophole in a short period of time! ”

Unfortunately.

The person he met was ye Zhuo!

Ye Zhuo’s white fingers quickly jumped on the black keyboard.

“For a moment, the room could only hear the sound of typing on the keyboard. ”
