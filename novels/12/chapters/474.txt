“If Lin Jincheng hadn’t threatened her with his life, Old Lady Lin wouldn’t have let Lin Jincheng drive to find ye Shu that night. ”

“If Lin Jincheng hadn’t driven to find ye Shu, Lin Jincheng wouldn’t have lost a leg. ”

Old Lady Lin Hated Ye Shu.

She wanted to send ye Shu straight to hell!

“Feng Qianhua continued to defend ye Shu. “Aunt Lin, Sister Ye Shu is not to blame for all of this. Love is uncontrollable, just like how I love brother Jin Cheng. I’m willing to give up everything for Brother Jin Cheng.” ”

“”I don’t want brother Jin Cheng to suffer so much. So, Aunt Lin, I beg you, please help sister Ye Shu and brother Jin Cheng!” ”

Old Madam Lin did not understand why Feng Qianhua was so kind.

“It was ye Shu who took everything from Feng Qianhua, but Feng Qianhua not only didn’t blame ye Shu, but she even pleaded on ye Shu’s behalf. ”

“”Qianhua, if that B * Tch ye Shu really loved Jin Cheng, she wouldn’t have cuckolded him! She didn’t Love Jin Cheng at all, she just loved Jin Cheng’s power! If Jin Cheng was a pauper back then, ye Shu would have run away with someone long ago!” ”

“Feng Qianhua was already in tears. “Aunt Lin, but seeing brother Jin Cheng like that, I feel really bad.” ”

“Old Madam Lin patted Feng Qianhua’s hand. “It’s almost over. Everything is almost over. Qianhua, you’re a good woman, and Jin Cheng isn’t blind. I believe that he will definitely remember how good you are.” ”

“With that diary, Lin Jin Cheng would definitely be responsible for Feng Qianhua. ”

“Old Madam Lin took a tissue to wipe Feng Qianhua’s face. “Good child, don’t cry. Don’t say such silly things in the future. Ye Shu, that B * Tch, isn’t worth it for you to treat her so well. She doesn’t deserve it!” ”

“When Feng Qianhua was mentioned, Old Madam Lin’s face was full of smiles, but whenever ye Shu was mentioned, Old Madam Lin’s face would immediately turn ferocious. Her appearance wasn’t good to begin with, but now that she looked ferocious.., it was even more terrifying. ”

“Feng Qianhua choked with sobs and said, “Aunt Lin, I just went to see Brother Jin Cheng. Doctor an told me that a heart disease needs to be cured by medicine. I’m afraid that he won’t be able to survive.” ”

“After saying that, Feng Qianhua continued, “No matter how big of a mistake sister ye Shu has made, it’s still in the past. Aunt Lin, please forgive her this once and help her and brother Jin Cheng, okay?” ”

“Seeing Feng Qianhua like this, old madam Lin could not help but tear up. “Qianhua, you are Jin city’s medicine. The only person who can cure him is you.” ”

“Daughter-in-law, Old Madam Lin only acknowledged Feng Qianhua. ”

Not to mention anything else.

“Just based on the fact that Feng Qianhua had taken care of her by her side for 19 years, this filial piety was not something that others could compare to. ”

“Old Madam Lin continued, “Qianhua, don’t cry. You’ve guarded Jin city for so many years. It’s time for you to see the light of day.” ”

“Under Madam Lin’s persuasion, Feng Qianhua finally stopped crying after a long while. Her mood gradually calmed down. “Aunt Lin, I’ve lost my composure today, but I hope you can seriously consider my suggestion.” ”

Madam Lin nodded her head in agreement.

Feng Qianhua then bid her farewell.

Madam Lin personally sent her out.

“Worried that Feng Qianhua’s bad mood would affect her driving, madam Lin specially called the chauffeur at home to send Feng Qianhua back. ”

“Seeing Feng Qianhua get into the car with her own eyes, Old Mrs. Lin was relieved and walked back. ”

“Aunt Zhang supported Old Mrs. Lin and said with emotion, “Old Mrs. Lin, Miss Qianhua is too soft-hearted. Nineteen years ago, if she had fought for it, Jin city would not have been deceived by Ye Shu.” ”

“Old Mrs. Lin Sighed. “Fortunately, we have already changed Jin city’s diary. I see that Jin city is not as resistant to Qianhua as before. This is a good thing.” ”

“Aunt Zhang nodded. Suddenly, a worried look appeared in her eyes. “The safe on the Tower of Jin city hasn’t been opened yet. Do you think there will be any trouble when that time comes?” ”

Lin Jin city had the habit of hiding important things in the safe.

“Therefore, old madam Lin guessed that there must be something in the safe. ”

Perhaps it was related to ye Shu.

“Old Madam Lin narrowed her eyes, “Don’t worry about this. Even if there really is something in the safe, Jin city will probably forget about it! Otherwise, he would have come back to get it! “Moreover, the key is in my hands now. If Jin city comes back to stay, he can just find an excuse and ask him to change rooms.” ”

“Aunt Zhang nodded. “Old Madam, that’s what you said, but the safe is always there. It’s a disaster after all. What if one day...” ”VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔
