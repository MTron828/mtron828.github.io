“Zhao Xue smiled and said, “If not, hurry up and take a sip. I can see that your hands are red from the cold.” ”

“Okay.”Si Lu lowered his head and took a sip.

“Is it good?”Zhao Xue Yin asked expectantly.

“It’s good.”Si Lu nodded slightly.

“Zhao Xue Yin continued, “Then drink another sip.” ”

Si lui took another big sip.

Only then did Zhao Xueyin put away the milk tea and continue drinking.

“Si lui watched Zhao Xueyin drinking the milk tea through the rearview mirror, and his face turned even redder. ” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The snow was falling heavily.

“Not long after, the car stopped at the entrance of the Japanese restaurant. ”

“Si lui opened the door and got out of the car. He went around to the other side, opened the door of the passenger seat, and extended his hand to Zhao Xueyin. “Xueyin, we’re here.” ”

Zhao Xueyin placed her hand on the lawyer’s hand and got out of the car.

“Although it was winter, there were quite a number of people eating Japanese food. Customers who did not have an appointment had to make an appointment in advance before they could enter the restaurant to eat. ”

“However, Zhao Xueyin was a high-level member of the restaurant, so there was no need to make an appointment in advance. ”

The two of them followed the salesperson to the private room.

“Zhao Xueyin took off her thick coat. The salesperson was about to take the coat and hang it up, but the lawyer took it one step ahead of her. ”

“Zhao Xueyin was already used to such things. She sat down, picked up the menu and ordered. She looked up at Si lui out of habit, “Brother Si, shall we eat the set meal recommended by the head chef? I think this sea urchin is quite fresh.” ”

“Sure.”Si lui nodded. He had no objections to Zhao Xueyin’s suggestion.

Zhao Xueyin closed the menu and looked up at the waiter. “Two sets of the set meal recommended by the head chef.”

“”Okay.”The waiter continued, “Do you need anything else?” ”

“I don’t need anything else.”

The waiter bowed. “Please wait for a moment.”

“After the waiter left, Zhao Xueyin looked up at Si Lu. “Brother Si, I’m going to the washroom.” ”

“Okay.”Si Lu nodded.

Zhao Xueyin turned around and walked towards the washroom.

“Just as she reached the door, she was suddenly hit by someone who walked out from inside. Zhao Xueyin quickly held onto the door frame by the side so that she did not fall. ”

“Otherwise, she would definitely be in a sorry state! ”

“The young woman who bumped into Zhao Xueyin quickly apologized, “Sorry! Sorry! I didn’t mean it!” ”

“Zhao xueyin frowned slightly, “Don’t you have eyes?” ”

“The young woman said apologetically, “It’s all my fault for being in such a hurry! But I really didn’t do it on purpose. Miss Zhao, please forgive me.” ”

Miss Zhao?

Could it be someone she knew?

Zhao Xueyin looked up and only then did she see the other party’s face clearly. A mocking look flashed across her eyes.

The person who came was called Chen Xuan.

The Chen family was famous in the financial world for having a poor household.

There had always been an unwritten rule in the financial world.

“If a family suddenly declined and could not rise again within 20 years, they would be expelled from the financial world. ”

“Ever since Old Master Chen left, the Chen family had been like a sunset. ”

“The Chen family did not have any men. They only had one daughter, Chen Xuan. Chen Xuan’s talent was mediocre and had no business talent. It was only a matter of time before the Chen family was expelled from the financial world. ”

Zhao Xueyin’s friends were all elites in the financial world. She did not have time to deal with people like Chen Xuan. “Consider me unlucky. You can go.”

“”Thank you, Miss Zhao.”Chen Xuan bowed to Zhao Xueyin. ”

“Zhao Xueyin entered the bathroom. Just as she closed the cubicle door, she heard the discussion outside. ”

“Was that Zhao Xueyin just now?”

“”Who else could it be but her? !”! If one were to say that Chen Xuan was really unlucky, she had to bump into someone else! “Miss Ye will be back soon. I want to see how long this fake Phoenix Zhao Xueyin can be complacent for!”Towards the end, that person snorted coldly. ”

“Although ye Zhuo had not returned yet, the news of grandfather Ye’s biological great-granddaughter returning to the financial world had spread throughout the financial world. ”

Grandfather Ye was a legend in the financial world.

“When ye Langhua was young, she was a famous talent in the capital. ”

“Therefore, everyone was very much looking forward to ye Zhuo’s return. ”

“Another person said in a low voice, “But I heard that Miss Ye is just like that! After all, with such a grandmother around, how good do you think she will be?” ”

“The younger generation surpasses the younger generation! This kind of thing can not be said for sure!”

“”A fake Phoenix is a fake Phoenix after all. How can it compare to a real Phoenix? No matter what, Miss Ye is still grandfather Ye’s descendant! Cao Wei and the others are already arranging a welcoming banquet for Miss Ye. Just wait! Zhao Xueyin, this fake Phoenix, will fall off the altar sooner or later!” ”

PA!

“Right at this moment, the cubicle door behind them was suddenly pushed open. ”
