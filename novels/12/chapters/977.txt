“The beautician smiled and said, “It doesn’t matter. Shall we start now? Who Wants to have a mole?” ”

“XI weiyue said softly, “It’s my sister.”Then, Xi Weiyue walked to the woman’s side and held her wrist. “Come here, Sister. Let’s come over here.” ”

The woman looked at Xi Weiyue with a terrifying expression.

“Yang Jiao pointed at the woman’s hand and asked, “How long will it take to apply a small red mole here?” ”

“The beautician said, “This will be very fast. It’ll only take half an hour.” ”

“Okay.”Yang Jiao nodded.

“Xi Weiyue looked at the beautician. “Excuse me, can I ask if this mole will look natural after it’s been applied? Can you tell that it was applied in the later stages?” ”

“The beautician smiled and said, “Don’t worry. The technology is very mature now. It’s impossible to tell if the mole was touched later or natural.” ”

“Will it fade?”Xi Weiyue asked.

“”Don’t worry, it’s the same as a tattoo. It Won’t fade,”the beautician said. ”

Xi Weiyue was relieved. “Then I’ll have to trouble you.”

“You’re too kind. This is my duty.”

The beautician had originally thought that Xi Weiyue was a very fierce person. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Now it seemed that she had misunderstood XI Weiyue.

“Xi Weiyue looked down at the woman beside her. “Sister, be good and sit down quickly.” ”

“The woman’s body trembled as she sat down, not daring to move at all. ”

“She was very scared, and her eyes were filled with fear and unease. ”

The beautician started to give the woman a mole.

“At this moment, the air suddenly smelled of urine. ”

It smelled very bad.

Xi Weiyue and Yang Jiao looked at each other and saw disgust in each other’s eyes.

The mother and daughter did not expect that this crazy woman did not even know how to use the toilet.

The beautician was also a little embarrassed.

“Xi Weiyue immediately reacted. “I’m sorry, my sister is like this. Sometimes, she will incontinence. I’ll take her to the toilet.” ”

The beautician stood up. “Okay.”

Yang Jiao immediately followed Xi Weiyue and the mother and daughter went to the bathroom together.

The woman seemed to sense the anger of Yang Jiao and Xi Weiyue. She shrunk her shoulders and was so scared that she did not even dare to breathe. She was like a lamb at the mercy of others.

“When they arrived at the bathroom, Yang Jiao immediately closed the door and covered her nose. “This crazy woman! She’s really unlucky! She actually peed on herself! Weiyue, what should we do now?” ”

“Xi Weiyue’s face was cold as she pinched the woman. “If you dare to pee on yourself again, I’ll strangle you to death!” ”

“At this moment, how could xi weiyue still be like her usual self? ”

“In front of everyone, she had two completely different faces. ”

“”Sob, sob, sob...”the woman was like a child, hugging her arms as she squatted on the ground and sobbed softly. ”

“Don’t Cry Anymore!”Yang Jiao raised her leg and kicked her.

“Xi Weiyue only thought that the crazy woman who was delirious was easy to deal with. She never thought that although the crazy woman was easy to deal with, it was so troublesome. “If you cry again, I’ll kill you!” ”

“In the air, it was as if someone had pressed the pause button. The woman immediately stopped crying and looked up at Xi Weiyue. ”

“Yang jiao smiled and said, “Weiyue, you’re really bold!” ”

“XI weiyue frowned and said, “Mother, please take her to take a shower first. I’ll call someone to send a set of clean clothes over.” ”

Yang Jiao nodded.

Xi Weiyue went out to make a call.

“Soon, someone sent a new set of clothes over. ”

Yang Jiao changed her new clothes and brought her to the living room. The beautician continued to give her a mole.

“XI weiyue smiled and said, “Sister, if you want to go to the toilet later, remember to tell me. Don’t Pee on Yourself, Okay?” ”

The woman nodded blankly.

“Half an hour later, the mole was done. As it had just been done, there was still some redness and swelling in the area between her thumb and index finger. ”

“Xi Weiyue stood up and said, “How many days will it take for the swelling to go down?” ”

“The beautician said as she packed up her tools, “This will be very fast. It will take about two to three days for it to fully recover. If there are any problems, you can ask Ms. Yang to contact me directly on her phone.” ”

“”Okay, thank you.” ”

“You’re welcome.”

Xi Weiyue got up and walked the beautician out of the door.

“After the beautician left, Yang Jiao walked out of the bathroom. “You’re done?” ”

Xi Weiyue nodded. “But the beautician said that it would take about three days for the swelling to go down.”She could use these three days to do other things.

Yang Jiao took out her phone. “Then I’ll call your father and let him know.”
