She was born out of wedlock and was chased out of the house by her parents.

She had nothing.

She had to take care of the child who had just reached the full moon while working to earn money.

“Now that she thought about it, she did not even know how she survived those years.”

“Ye Zhuo walked over and hugged ye Shu. “Mom, Don’t cry. It’s not worth it for that kind of scumbag. You still have me in the future! No matter what, I will always be by your side.””

Ye Shu hugged ye Zhuo and nodded with a sob.

There was only one day left until the engagement date.

Old Lady Lin had already sent out all the invitations.

“She had invited many of the wealthy and famous people in the capital, including the Cen family.”

Old Lady Cen and she had been old friends for many years. Old Lady Cen would definitely personally attend Lin Jin city’s marriage event.

The night before the engagement party.

The Feng family.

The Feng family’s daughters-in-law had never thought that Feng Qianhua would really marry into the Lin family.

“After all, the Lin family had made Feng Qianhua wait for nineteen years in vain.”

“Thinking of their usual sarcasm towards Feng Qianhua, the four sisters-in-law were filled with regret. They all came to Feng Qianhua’s house to congratulate her.”

“The Lin family was not an ordinary wealthy family. If Feng Qianhua left with hatred, their good days would come to an end.”

“”Qianhua, this is a gift from sister-in-law. You must accept it.””

“”Little sister, usually, second sister-in-law speaks quickly. If she has offended you in any way, please don’t hold it against second sister-in-law.””

“”And me, Little Sister. Actually, fourth sister-in-law is not a bad person. It’s just that she can’t hide the truth in her heart. She has a sharp tongue but a soft heart...””

“”Qianhua, Qianhua! Mother gave this to me when I got married. Now, I’m giving it to you.””

Feng Qianhua had never seen a few sisters-in-law behave so lowly in the Feng family.

“Usually, they were all high and mighty, pointing fingers at Feng Qianxian and herself.”

Who would have thought that they would also have such a day!

“For a moment, Feng Qianhua felt extremely happy.”

“”Eldest sister-in-law, second sister-in-law, third sister-in-law, fourth sister-in-law, I’ve remembered all your kindness over the years. Don’t worry, after I marry into the Lin family, I Won’t forget all of you.””

These words made the hearts of the four of them tremble.

What did Feng Qianhua Mean?

She wanted revenge?

“Before the four of them could react, Feng Qianhua stood up and said, “Sisters-in-law, I need to rest. You can go back first.””

“”Little sister, then we won’t disturb your rest.””

“Walking out of the door, the four of them took off their disguises. Feng Qianhua’s second sister-in-law said anxiously, “Do you think she will really hold a grudge?””

“I think she will. Look at how petty she is!”

“”If we knew this would happen, we would have treated her better.””

“At this moment, old madam Feng walked over from the opposite side. “What are the four of you whispering about?””

“In the Feng family, Old Madam Feng was an absolute authority.”

“Feng second aunt said hesitantly, “We are worried about Qianhua...””

Old Madam Feng glanced at second sister-in-law of the Feng family. “Worried that she’ll give you little shoes to wear?”

“The four of them looked at each other and did not say a word, feeling guilty.”

“Old Madam Feng’s face was stern. “As long as the few of you treat them a little better on a daily basis, you don’t have to worry about this now! All of you have turned a deaf ear to my words! Why, do you regret it now?””

Who Dared to answer her?

“After a long while, Mrs Feng gathered her courage and said, “Mother, I heard from Qianhua’s words just now that she, she seems to still be holding a grudge! Why Don’t you go and plead for us?””

“Old Madam Feng glanced at Mrs Feng and continued, “Don’t worry! She’s not the kind of person who doesn’t know the gravity of the situation! She should know the principle of ‘if one loses, one will prosper’.””

“Even if Feng Qianhua married into the Lin family, the Feng family would still be her backing.”

She was a smart woman. She would never make an enemy out of her own family.

“Hearing old madam Feng’s words, the few of them were relieved. “It’s said that the older the ginger, the spicier it is. This saying is indeed true. Mom, with you saying this, we are relieved.””

Old Madam Feng nodded. “It’s getting late. Go and rest. You still have to attend Qianhua’s engagement party tomorrow.”

The few of them returned to their respective rooms.

“After the few sisters-in-law of the Feng family left, Feng Qianhua began to educate Feng Xianxian.”

“”Xianxian, did you see that? Only if we stand tall will those who once looked down on us be filled with regret! They will think of all ways to please us! In this world, apart from power and money, family and love are all lies! Only grasp the power, can stand at the top.””
