Translator: 549690339

“Cen Haifeng lowered his head and looked at Duanmu Fengfei. “Duanmu Fengfei, you know that I have a wife and children. Why did you lie to me? Why?” ”

Cen Haifeng felt disgusted when he saw Duanmu fengfei.

He did not understand why Duanmu Fengfei had to interfere in his relationship with Zhou Xiang!

“If Duanmu Fengfei had told him the truth earlier, things wouldn’t have turned out this way. ”

“”Why?”Duanmu Fengfei decided to stop pretending. She raised her head and looked at Cen Haifeng with a sarcastic look in her eyes, “Do you think I have a choice? It’s the same for all the major alliances in the past dynasties. Even if I’m not the one who marries you, there will be someone else!” ”

She was merely following the arrangement of fate.

Who asked the daughter of the Duanmu family to be born as the most honorable woman in the world?

“If it were anyone else, they would have made the same choice as her. ”

How did it become her fault when it came to Cen Haifeng?

“Duanmu huangfei continued, “Cen Haifeng, Do You Think You’re Innocent? Am I not innocent? I am the only daughter of the Duanmu family, and my parents Dote on me. Not only did I marry you, a man who once had a family, but now, you are still treating me like this? If you weren’t willing to marry me, why didn’t you object twenty years ago? What is this now? False benevolence! If you really couldn’t forget Zhou Xiang, you wouldn’t have waited until now to remember all this! You’re both right and wrong! Cen Haifeng, you make me feel sick! ”

Very sick!

Very sick!

Duanmu fengfei only felt that her 20 years of youth had been fed to the dogs.

“At the same time, she also felt very regretful. ”

She regretted that she was merciful and didn’t kill those disgusting people on Earth in time.

“If those disgusting people all died, she wouldn’t have any future troubles. ”

Especially that Zhou Xiang!

Duanmu Fengfei’s eyes were filled with regret.

“Slap!”

A crisp and clear slap landed on Duanmu Fengfei’s right face.

“This slap made Duanmu Fengfei’s ears buzz, and her face burned. ”

Painful.

Very painful.

Good.

Very good.

“Duanmu fengfei raised her head and looked at Cen Haifeng, her face full of sarcasm. ”

Cen Haifeng actually hit her for that unpresentable earthling.

Hot Tears rolled down her cheeks.

“One Drop, two drops. ”

“Cen Haifeng looked at duanmu Fengfei and said, “I’m going to cancel our marriage right now! From now on, we have nothing to do with each other!” ”

“After saying that, Cen Haifeng turned around and left. ”

“Looking at Cen Haifeng’s back, Duanmu Fengfei’s eyes widened. In the next second, she directly pounced over and hugged Cen Haifeng’s calf, “No! No! Haifeng, you can’t do this to me! We have been married for more than 20 years. Don’t you have any feelings for me?” ”

“If her marriage with Cen Haifeng was annulled, what would she become? ” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

A joke?

“She had been married to Cen Haifeng for more than 20 years, not to live as a joke! ”

“In short, she could not let Cen Haifeng cancel it! ”

“”Haifeng, I Beg You,”Duanmu huangfei cried, “If you really cancel it, then I won’t be able to live. Do you want to watch me die? Haifeng!” ”

“Cen Haifeng looked down at Duanmu Huangfei, his eyes full of determination. ”

“This time, no matter what, he could not let Zhou Xiang down again! ”

He had to give Zhou Xiang an explanation.

“With this in mind, Cen Haifeng kicked Duanmu Huangfei away. ”

Duanmu Huangfei did not expect things to turn out like this. She was kicked to the ground and her heart was filled with sorrow.

What should she do?

What should she do?

“At this moment, Duanmu Huangfei suddenly thought of elder da Zhang and the National Master. ”

Yes.

There was still the great elder and the National Master.

They would definitely have a way to help her.

“With this in mind, Duanmu Huangfei’s eyes lit up. She immediately got up from the ground and contacted the Grand Elder and the Grand Elder. ”

“The Grand Elder and the grand elder had already rested when they received the news. After receiving the news, they immediately got up from their beds and rushed to the headquarters. ”

Annulment of marriage!

This was no joke.

“When the two of them arrived, Duanmu Huangfei had already sorted out his emotions. However, the scars on his face still looked very frightening. ”

“”Madam, did the Master of the Headquarters Attack You?”The National Master stood up and asked. ”

“Duanmu huangfei nodded and continued, “The two of you, what exactly is going on? I invited the two of you here to reinforce the forbidden technique! Why would haifeng think of that?” ”
