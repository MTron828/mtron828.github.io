“But this 300,000 was only used on Old Lady Li for about 100,000. The other 200,000, Old Lady Li left it all to Li Erzhu! ”

“Once, when he gave the card to Old Lady Li, Old Lady Li raised her head and gave the card to Li Erzhu. ”

“At that time, Li Sanzhu couldn’t help it. ”

But he still held it in!

“After all, his mother had been by Li Erzhu’s side all these years. ”

“Old Lady Li looked at Li Sanzhu in disbelief, her turbid eyes wide open. ”

Was this still her obedient son?

When did Li Sanzhu become like this! !

“Old Lady Li’s footsteps were unsteady, and she took a few steps back, “Li Sanzhu! Do you even have a conscience when you say these words! ! When you were young, you were weak and sickly. When you were eight years old, you had a high fever and did not wake up for three days and three nights. If I had not knelt in front of the bodhisattva for an entire day, you would have died long ago!” ”

“Old Madam Li was a very superstitious person. Every time she had a headache or a fever, she would go to pray to the gods and Buddha. Li Sanzhu had a high fever when he was three years old. If old master Li had not sent Li Sanzhu to the hospital in time, Li Sanzhu would have indeed died long ago, but Old Mrs. Li had always felt that it was all thanks to her! ”

“Li Sanzhu sighed. “Mom, today is the first day of the New Year. I don’t want to argue with you. Please have a seat. I’ll go make tea for you.” ”

“”Dad, I’ll go.”Li Yueyue continued, “You accompany Grandma.” ”

“Okay.”Li Sanzhu nodded.

“Looking at Li Yueyue’s back, old Mrs. Li snorted coldly. “This hypocritical behavior is exactly the same as her mother!” ”

“Mother!”Li Sanzhu frowned.

“Li Yue was his precious daughter, but old madam Li treated Li Yue like a weed. ”

“Seeing the veins on Li Sanzhu’s face, old madam Li gave up and didn’t continue. ”

She still had more important things to do.

“After a while, Li Yue came over with tea. “Grandma, be careful, it’s hot.” ”

Old Madam Li nodded.

“At this moment, Fang yinyue came over with a bowl of cooked noodles. “Mom, the noodles are ready. Eat It while it’s hot.” ”

“Put it there.”

Fang yinyue put the noodles aside.

“Old madam Li continued, “Since both of you are here, I have something to ask you.” ”

“”Please speak,”said Li Sanzhu. ”

“Old madam Li said, “When do you plan to go to the police station to close the case?” ”

Close the case?

“Li Sanzhu was very speechless. “Mom, what makes you think that I have the right to go to the police station to close the case?” ”

“”If you don’t have the right, who does?”Old Madam Li asked. “Wasn’t it you who sent Shuyi in?” ”

“Fang yinyue didn’t say anything. Her relationship with old madam Li was like walking on thin ice. If she spoke now, it would be no different from adding fuel to the fire. ”

Such a scene should be left to Li Sanzhu.

“Li Sanzhu said, “Shuyi was sent in by CEN fifth master because she was indecent! If you want to close the case, go directly to CEN fifth master. It’s useless to look for me!” ”

Indecent!

Who was Li Sanzhu calling indecent!

Old Lady Li was provoked by these words. She slammed the table angrily and stood up. “Li Sanzhu! Who are you talking about! Who is indecent! Who is indecent! Tell me clearly!”

Li Shuyi was still an unmarried lady. How could she be framed by Li Sanzhu like this!

“If this were to spread, how would Li Shuyi continue to be a person in the future! ” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“”Mom, since Shuyi dared to do such a thing, she shouldn’t be afraid of being said.”Li Sanzhu continued, “It’s easy for you to shut my mouth, but can you shut everyone’s mouth?” ”

“Hearing this, Old Madam Li was stunned. After a moment, she continued: ”

“”You’re Shu Yi’s uncle. You Can’t say that!”Old Madam Li was very angry. “I don’t care. You have to bail Shu Yi out! Otherwise, I’m not done with you!” ”

“How could there be such an uncle in the world? It was fine if he didn’t want to help when his niece was in trouble, but now he was here gloating! ”

“”I really can’t help you with this matter. It’s Shu Yi’s fault for provoking the wrong person,”said Li Sanzhu. ”

“Old Mrs. Li narrowed her eyes. “I heard that Fifth Master Cen is your guest. Since he’s your guest, I should give you some face...” Old Mrs. Li paused and changed her tone, she continued, “Shuyi is your biological niece after all. No matter what, as an uncle, you can’t just watch her go to jail! If she really goes to jail, her life will be ruined!” ”

“Li Sanzhu looked at Old Madam Li, “Mom, don’t you understand the situation? It’s not that I don’t want to help! It’s that the other party is fifth master Cen. I’m just a cattle breeder. Do you think I can speak in front of Fifth Master Cen?” ”
