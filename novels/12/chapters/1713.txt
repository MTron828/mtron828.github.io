The danger on Europa was more than ten times crueler than imagined.

“With the current technology of mankind, there was no way to compete with the mutants on Europa. ”

“Even in the world before ye Zao, no one dared to easily land on Europa! ”

“Not only that, the resources on Europa were not beneficial to mankind at all. On the contrary, they were all bad. ”

“Although there were trees on Europa under the observation of the Hubble telescope, the trees on Europa did not need photosynthesis and would not release oxygen. Instead, they would create harmful gases. ”

“To The Mutants, Europa was heaven. ”

“But to humans, it was Hell on Earth! ”

“Cen Jiang did not understand Europa, but he believed in ye Zhuo. “Europa is full of danger. Director Ma and Professor Feng will definitely regret it, but there are all kinds of medicine in this world, but there is no medicine for regret.” ”

“Once they landed in Europa, there was indeed no medicine for regret. ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Did the two of them take anything else?” ”

“”Other than the volcanic crystal analysis report, nothing else was touched,”Cen Jiang said. ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“”Miss Ye, do you want to issue an arrest warrant?”Cen Jiang continued to ask. ”

“Director Ma and Professor Feng were both technologists. The technology industry’s intranet could issue arrest warrants. Currently, China was the leader of the technology industry. As long as this arrest warrant was issued, director Ma and Professor Feng would not be able to leave C country for the rest of their lives, once they left C country, they would be immediately arrested! ”

“”No need,”ye Zhuo said. ”

Cen Jiang nodded.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “By the way, what time do you usually have a regular meeting with Mars?” ”

“Around 10:30 in the morning.”

“Mars was very similar to Earth. There were spring, summer, autumn, and winter, but there were also days and nights. The autobiographical cycle was very similar to Earth’s. The time of day was 24 hours and 37 minutes. At 10 o’clock in the morning on Earth, the time on Mars was equivalent to 8 or 9 o’clock in the morning. ”

“Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Okay, call me after the regular meeting.” ”

“Okay.”Cen Jiang nodded.

Ye Zao entered the work cabin. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

At the same time.

Mars.

“Yu Zifei was lying on a smooth rock, looking at the Blue Planet hanging in the sky. ”

“Mars was very close to Earth, so looking at Earth on Mars made it seem very big, even bigger than looking at the Moon on Earth. ”

“Yu Zifei took out his phone and took a photo. When he was about to send the photo to his family, he remembered that there was no signal on Mars, so he could only smile helplessly. ”

“”Homesick?”At this moment, CEN he walked over and imitated Yu Zifei. He lay on a rock and rested his head on his hand, looking at Earth thousands of miles away. ”

“Yu Zifei smiled and said, “This feeling is quite strange. When I was in Beijing, even if I didn’t go back for a month, I wouldn’t miss home. Now that I’ve only been on Mars for more than a week, I already miss my parents a little.” ”

“”Me too.”Cen he looked at the azure earth and continued, “What do you think they’re doing now?” ”

“Who?”Yu Zifei asked.

“”Just Dajiang and the others.”CEN he continued, “I wonder if Miss Ye and master five have returned.” ”

“Yu Zifei said, “Miss ye should be back soon, right?” ”

“I really miss them!”Cen he sighed. “I go back once a month. It’s only been seven days.”

“Yu Zifei smiled and said, “Don’t you see team leader Cen and the others every day during the regular meetings?” ”

“”That feeling is different.”CEN he continued, “Old Yu, you broke up with your girlfriend last time. How is it now? Have you gotten back together?” ”

“No.”

“Cen he turned to look at Yu Zifei and continued, “It’s right that you haven’t gotten back together! Even if that girlfriend of yours is really married, she will definitely do something to betray you in the future!” ”

“Okay.”

“The two of them chatted casually. Soon, the sky on Mars was bright. ”

The two of them stood up from the rock and began to arrange their work for the day.

“”Erhe! erhe!”At this moment, Tang Mi ran over excitedly. “Old Yu is here too!” ”

“What’s Wrong?”Cen he looked at Tang Mi.

“Tang mi said excitedly, “It sprouted! The potatoes that I planted in the test field a few days ago sprouted today!” ”

“Really?”Yu Zifei said in surprise.

“They had been on Mars for a week and had done a lot of experiments, but there had been no results so far. Now that they heard that the potatoes sprouted, they were extremely excited! ”

“Of course it’s true! Come and take a look with me!”Tang mi led them to the test field.
