Translator: 549690339

This Xiao Qing was quite good at lying through his teeth.

Did he really think that everyone in the world was a fool?

“”Then thank her little aunt. Quick, come in and have a seat.”Mother Tang welcomed Xiao Qing into the house. ”

Xiao Qing followed her into the house.

Mother Tang poured a glass of water for Xiao Qing.

“Xiao Qing smiled and said, “If I sit, I’ll leave. I don’t need to drink water! Right, why haven’t I seen Little Xue?” ”

“Tang said, “Xiaoxue has gone upstairs to rest. If you have anything to say, just tell me. We’re family, so there’s no need to be polite.” ”

“”It’s nothing. I’m just asking.”Xiao Qing continued, “By the way, among those local specialties, there’s a dried scallop. It’s especially good for making soup, but it has a bit of a fishy smell. When you’re making soup, remember to ask Auntie to add more cooking wine and Ginger.” ”

“Okay.”Tang nodded.

“Xiao Qing drank a mouthful of water and placed the cup on the table. He stood up and said, “Then I’ll go back First!” ”

Go Back?

Tang was stunned!

“Xiao Qing hadn’t even started begging her, and she was going back already? ”

“Tang continued, “Why don’t I get someone to call Xiaoxue Down?” ”

She really wanted to see Xiao Qing behave so submissively.

“”No need, no need.”Xiao Qing smiled and said, “I don’t have anything to do with Xiaoxue. Why did you call her down? I’m leaving First!” ”

“After saying that, Xiao Qing turned around and walked out of the door. ”

“Looking at Xiao Qing’s back, Tang frowned tightly. ”

It was different.

This was very different from what she had imagined!

Could it be that Tang Mi didn’t want to continue staying in the CEN Group’s base?

“Tang felt a little uncomfortable and couldn’t help but call out to Xiao Qing, “Her aunt, wait a moment.” ”

“”Sister-in-law, is there anything else?”Xiao Qing turned to look at Tang. ”

“Tang continued, “Her aunt, when you go back, ask Tang Mi if she has really joined the aircraft carrier project team?” ”

“Yes.”Xiao Qing nodded.

“Then don’t you guys have anything to say?”Tang asked.

“Xiao Qing took a deep breath, “How should I put it! Actually, I’m very opposed to her being in the aircraft carrier project team, but this girl is one-track minded. No matter how I try to persuade her, it won’t work! Moreover, she won and supported her. Standing on her side, I can only let her go! I still have to have a dream! What if it comes true?” ”

“At the end of his speech, Xiao Qing laughed out loud. ” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Her little aunt! Have you thought it through? This matter isn’t a joke! I heard from Xiaoxue that that miss ye even signed the bet agreement!”Tang said.

“Xiao Qing nodded. “I know, I know! But since it has already happened, I can only let her go! Alright, sister-in-law, I Won’t talk to you anymore. I have to go back!” ”

“After saying that, Xiao Qing turned around and left. ”

“Looking at Xiao Qing’s back, Tang snorted coldly. “The whole family are idiots! What if it comes true! In your dreams!” ”

“After Xiao Qing left, Tang hurriedly ran upstairs. “Xiaoxue! Xiaoxue! I have something big to say!” ”

“What big thing?”Tang Xue raised her head to look at Tang. “There was a big fuss.”

“Tang continued, “Just now, Xiao Qing came over. Guess what she said?” ”

“Did she beg you?”Tang Xue asked.

“No.”Tang shook her head. “You definitely can’t Guess!”

Tang Xue narrowed her eyes. “What exactly is it? Don’t keep us guessing!”

“Tang continued, “Xiao Qing and Tang Shengli actually agreed to let Tang mi continue to stay in the aircraft carrier project team. They even said that young people should have dreams. What if they have eyes? ! Do you think they’re crazy? !” ”

“Tang Xue snorted. “As expected, like father, like daughter! It’s fine if little aunt, a woman, can’t figure it out, but I didn’t expect little uncle to be confused with her!” ”

“These people, were they all living in a dream? ”

“Tang Xue continued, “That’s good too. Mother, you can tell this matter to the other uncles and grandpas in the family tomorrow!” ”

The Tang Clan was a large family.

“Alright.”Mother Tang nodded.

...

On the other side.

Wutong Garden.

Mu Yourong had already been locked up here for half a month.

“Although it was only half a month, Mu Yourong seemed to have changed into a completely different person. She was extremely thin and her eyes were lifeless. ”

Creak —

“At this moment, the door opened. ”

The sudden light caused mu yourong to squint her eyes in discomfort.

The first thing that came into her sight was a pair of shiny black leather shoes.

“Looking up from the pair of leather shoes, she saw the long legs that were wrapped in the suit pants, followed by that face that was as gentle as jade. ”

“Seeing that face, Mu Yourong’s originally expressionless eyes suddenly revealed a fearful expression. ”

“Every time she faced song Shiyu, she still couldn’t help but panic. ”
