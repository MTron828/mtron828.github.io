“How would I know that she gave me a limited edition ZY!”

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “Alright, Alright. Since the matter has already passed, let’s just let it pass. However, Miss ye is indeed very amazing. Not only is she a godly doctor, but she can also buy a limited edition ZY! “ZY doesn’t open its membership, nor does it let others use its backdoor. No matter who it is, they must abide by ZY’s rules of snatching the bill. I don’t know how Miss Ye bought it.” ”

Cen Yuyan narrowed her eyes.

This matter was indeed quite strange.

“”Could it be my fifth brother?”CEN Yuyan continued, “Actually, the person who bought Zy wasn’t Ye Zao at all, but my fifth brother? Chenyu, think about it. Other than my fifth brother, who else can buy six ZY limited edition new products in one go?” ”

Ye Zao was too tasteless!

“The few Sisters had given such generous gifts, but ye Zao actually borrowed flowers to offer Buddha! ”

“Seeing that Cen Yuyan had misinterpreted his meaning, song chenyu hurriedly explained, “Yuyan, that’s not what I meant! I just feel that Miss ye is definitely more powerful than what we saw. She’s not an ordinary person.” ”

“”Chenyu, don’t explain on her behalf. I know everything.”Cen Yuyan said somewhat indignantly, “I don’t know what my grandmother’s taste is like to actually take a liking to ye Zhuo. Other than being a little good-looking, what exactly is she worthy of my fifth brother?” ”

“As she finished speaking, Cen Yuyan turned her head to look at song Chenyu and said somewhat regretfully, “Chenyu! I already said that I wanted to set you up with my fifth brother! But you just didn’t agree! Look, now someone else has beaten me to it, right?” ”

“From the beginning, Cen Yuyan had the intention to set song Chenyu up with Cen Shaoqing. ”

“Who knew that song Chenyu wouldn’t take the initiative at all, not even taking the initiative to speak to Cen Shaoqing! ”

She was too Buddhist!

Song Chenyu had a faint smile on his face. “This can only mean that fifth master and I are fated to be apart.”

Cen Shaoqing was wholeheartedly devoted to Buddhism. He was a vegetarian all year round and didn’t get close to women.

“When he got along with such a person, he simply couldn’t rush to get close to her. He had to take things slowly and develop feelings over time. ”

What song Chenyu did not expect was this.

“After a trip to cloud capital, a beautiful figure appeared by Cen Shaoqing’s side. ”

Cen Yuyan did not agree with song Chenyu’s words. “Who said that my family and my fifth brother are fated to be apart? You were the one who knew him first! Just wait! He and that ye Zao will break up sooner or later!”

How could a fox not reveal its tail?

“”It shouldn’t be,”song Chenyu replied indifferently. “I think fifth master should love miss ye very much, and they are also very compatible.” ”

“Cen Yuyan said with certainty, “My fifth brother is indifferent to fame and fortune. Ye Zhuo is too materialistic. Sooner or later, my fifth brother will discover ye Zhuo’s true colors! “In short, Chenyu, you can’t be so Buddhist this time! “You have to take the initiative to fight for it. Look at Ye Zhuo. My fifth brother originally didn’t fancy her, but under ye Zhuo’s forceful attack, my fifth brother was still bewitched by her!” ”

“Song Chenyu did not continue this topic and placed his phone on the table. “Yuyan, wait a moment. I have something to give you.” ”

“En.”Cen Yuyan nodded.

“At this moment, CEN Yuyan’s gaze landed on song Chenyu’s phone. ”

This was an automatic video.

Who was the person in the video?

Ye Zao?

Cen Yuyan quickly picked up her phone.

It was ye Zao.

Sitara YC’s Ye?

He was actually a live streamer!

Cen Yuyan had never expected that ye Zao was actually a live streamer!

“In recent years, there had been more and more negative news about live streamers swindling for rewards. As a result, the public’s impression of live streamers had become worse and worse. ”

“In Cen Yuyan’s eyes, what was a live streamer? ”

A live streamer was equivalent to being vulgar!

“Seeing that ye Zao was actually a live streamer, CEN Yuyan felt that ye Zao was no longer worthy of Cen Shaoqing. ”

What was going on with Old Madam Cen?

She actually introduced a live streamer to CEN SHAOQING!

How could the CEN family’s future Mistress Be a live streamer?

Wasn’t she going to be a laughing stock?

“Soon, Song Chenyu came out. ”

“Cen Yuyan put down her phone, her expression somewhat ugly. ”

“”Yuyan, what’s Wrong?”Song Chenyu asked in puzzlement. ”

Cen Yuyan suppressed the anger in her heart and pretended as if nothing had happened. “Nothing.”

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “It’s good that you’re fine. Oh right, this is for you.” ”

“What’s This?”Cen Yuyan took the thing that song Chenyu handed over.

“Song Chenyu said, “This is a limited edition new product from ZY. Although it’s not as good as Miss Ye’s gift, it’s only limited to 3,000 pieces worldwide. My five assistants fought for it for a long time before they managed to get it.” ”
