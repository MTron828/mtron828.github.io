“Okay.”Lin Ze took a sip of wine and his gaze fell on a spot not far away. “I feel that my grandmother is a little abnormal these few days.”

“What’s abnormal?”Li Wen asked.

“Lin Ze frowned. “When I went back yesterday, I heard my grandmother and Aunt Zhang discussing the marriage between my father and Feng Qianhua.”Old Mrs. Lin’s eyes were filled with confidence. ”

She looked as if she had already married Feng Qianhua.

“Although Old Mrs. Lin had always told Aunt Zhang about this matter, it had never made Lin Ze so anxious. ”

He had a feeling that something must have happened.

“Otherwise, old Mrs. Lin would not be so sure with her words! ”

“Fat tiger said in surprise, “D * mn! So Feng Qianqian is really going to become your sister? Brother Ze, what are you going to do?” ”

“”Fat Tiger, what nonsense are you spouting!”Li Wen looked at fat tiger. “If Uncle Lin was going to marry Feng Qianhua, he would have done so long ago! Why did he wait until now?” ” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Fat Tiger also realized that he had said something wrong, he immediately changed his words. “Brother Ze, I was just saying it casually. Don’t take it seriously! As long as you don’t accept Auntie Feng and uncle Lin doesn’t accept Auntie Feng, can your grandmother marry Feng Xianxian’s mother on Uncle Lin’s behalf?” ”

“Dog two nodded in agreement. “Fat Tiger is right. As long as you and uncle Lin don’t agree, no one can force uncle Lin!” ”

“Li Wen patted Lin Ze on the shoulder. “So, brother Ze, don’t worry about it.” ”

Lin Ze narrowed his eyes.

Not worried.

He said he wasn’t worried.

But could he really be at ease?

“Feng Qianhua and her daughter were wild and ambitious. Once they entered the Lin family, the Lin family would really fall into chaos. ”

“The older Mrs. Lin got, the more muddle-headed she became. ”

She trusted Feng Qianhua without reservation.

Lin Ze almost didn’t dare to imagine what would happen if Feng Qianhua married into the Lin family.

“Thinking of this, Lin Ze picked up his phone and made a call. “Hello, is this uncle Zhao?” ”

“”It’s me,”secretary Zhao’s voice came from the other side. “Ah Ze, what’s the matter?” ”

“Lin Ze continued, “Has my dad been acting strangely during this period of time?” ”

“Secretary Zhang was stunned for a moment before continuing, “CEO Lin is still the same. After work, he went to the recuperation room. The situation isn’t good, nor is it bad.” ”

“Did Feng Qianhua go to look for my dad?”Lin Ze asked.

“No.”

“Although he had already gotten secretary Zhang’s answer, Lin Ze was still a little worried. After hanging up the phone, he greeted Li Wenpang, Tiger, and dog two before making a trip to the recuperation room. ”

“Coincidentally, when he arrived, Old Mrs. Lin was sitting in the ward, chatting with Lin Jincheng. ”

“To be more precise, it was old Mrs. Lin who was talking, while Lin Jincheng’s eyes were slightly closed. ”

It was unknown whether he was asleep or deep in thought.

“Seeing Lin Ze, Old Mrs. Lin asked in puzzlement, “Why is Ah Ze here?” ”

Lin Ze put down his bag. “I’m here to see my dad.”

“Hearing this, Lin Jincheng opened his eyes. He looked a little tired. “How is Ah Ze getting along with his classmates at the New School?” ”

“”Very well.”Lin Ze nodded. “Dad, Are You Alright?” ”

Lin Jincheng nodded slightly.

“Lin Ze picked up an apple. “Dad, I’ll Peel an Apple for you.” ”

“Okay.”

Old Madam Lin looked at Lin Ze and then at Lin Jincheng. A look of displeasure flashed across her eyes.

This father and son pair.

“I don’t look like me, and my son doesn’t look like my son. ”

None of them are easy to deal with.

“If Lin Jincheng hadn’t chosen ye Shu, that fickle woman, he wouldn’t have ended up like this, and he wouldn’t have lost a leg. ”

“Yet, even now, Lin Jincheng was still thinking about ye Shu. ”

“Fortunately, she woke up early. ”

She changed the diary.

“Otherwise, Lin Jincheng would probably be thinking about her for the rest of his life. ”

“Although Lin Jincheng had not fully accepted Feng Qianhua yet, old madam Lin believed that one day, Lin Jincheng would accept her. ”

“Soon, Lin Ze peeled an apple and handed it to Lin Jincheng. ”

“Old Madam Lin looked at Lin Ze. “Ah Ze, it’s getting late. You should go back with Grandma. Don’t disturb your father’s rest here.” ”

“After saying that, old Mrs. Lin turned back to look at Lin Jincheng. “Jincheng, go home more often if you have time.” ”

Lin Jincheng nodded slightly.

“”Grandma, I want to spend more time with my dad.”Lin Ze looked up at Old Mrs. Lin. ”

“Old Mrs. Lin wanted to reject Lin ze, but she was afraid that Lin Ze would suspect something, so she said, “Okay, I’ll wait for you to go back with me.” ”

Lin Ze narrowed his eyes. He didn’t understand what old Mrs. Lin was up to.
