“Chapter 541: 136: an unexpected turn of events. So it was the fanboy, Feng Xianxian, who was on the verge of collapse, who noticed the health-preserving soup! 3”

“Zheng Zimo said, “Then let’s go to the tea ceremony? The environment there is very good, and the service is also good.” ”

The tea ceremony was a member-made teahouse. Ordinary people could not enter at all.

“After saying that, Zheng Zimo looked at ye Zao. “Goddess, what do you think?” ”

“Yes.”

“Then let’s go quickly!”Zheng Zhilan hugged Feng Xianxian’s arm and stood up.

“Feng Xianxian was now a mute eating Coptis. She had no words to express her bitterness, so she could only stand up together with ye Zao. She seemed to be holding a ball of fire in her heart. ”

It was very uncomfortable!

“Zheng Zimo and ye Zao walked in front, while Zheng Zhilan and Feng Xianxian walked behind. ”

“Zheng Zhilan whispered to Feng xianxian, “Xianxian, I think you have a misunderstanding about my goddess. My Goddess is definitely not the kind of person who uses her power to bully others...” ”

Feng Xianxian was already very depressed in her heart.

Zheng Zhilan kept calling her ‘my goddess’. Feng Xianxian almost exploded on the spot when she heard that.

She originally thought that the two siblings were putting on an act for ye Zao to kill him.

“After all, the higher one stood, the worse one would fall. ”

Now it seemed that.

Things were not like that.

The two siblings were really ye Zao’s fans. They also really admired ye Zao.

Feng Xianxian didn’t understand why ye Zao had the right to do so?

Why did Zheng Zhilan suddenly change her opinion of ye Zao.

And why did ye Zao become Zheng Zhilan and Zheng Zimo’s goddess?

Just because ye Zao knew how to play chess?

So what if he knew how to play chess?

She also knew how to Go!

She was a 9-dan Go player.

What level was ye Zao at?

How could ye Zao compare to her?

Were Zheng Zimo and Zheng Zhilan Blind?

Feng Xianxian felt like someone had stolen something from her. It was as disgusting as eating a fly.

“After all, Zheng Zhilan was her best friend. ”

Zheng Zimo was someone who had a crush on her!

“Feng Xianxian smiled and said meaningfully, “Actually, zhilan... I was already mentally prepared.” ”

“”It’s not like that, Xianxian!”Zheng Zhilan felt that Feng Xianxian had misunderstood ye Zao, “My Goddess is really not that kind of person. Maybe you don’t know her yet. After you get to know her, you will know that she is a very good and outstanding person! I think my goddess is my life’s Goal!” ”

Zheng Zhilan liked chess very much.

She hoped that one day she could be like ye Zao and make a name for herself in the chess world. She hoped that she could have a group of her own fan siblings.

She was also working hard for her dream.

“”I know, Zhilan.”Feng Xianxian lowered her eyes in disappointment. “Ye Zao is so beautiful. Everyone appreciates beautiful things, so I understand you.” ”

“”Xianxian, it’s really not what you think! I don’t worship my goddess because she’s good-looking! It’s because she has the ability!”At this point.., zheng zhilan paused and continued, “Xianxian, I can understand your feelings, but please believe me. My judgment of people is not wrong, and my goddess is definitely not that kind of green tea.” ”

Feng Xianxian sighed softly and did not say anything else.

“For a moment, Zheng Zhilan did not know how to explain it to her. ”

“Just as they were about to reach the teahouse, Feng Xianxian suddenly said, “Zhilan, I suddenly feel a little uncomfortable, so I won’t go with you guys. I want to go back first.” ”

“Zheng Zhilan said with concern, “Xianxian, what’s wrong with you? Do you want my brother to send you back?” ”

“”Xianxian, why don’t I Send You Back?”Hearing this, Zheng Zimo turned to look at Feng Xianxian. ”

“”There’s no need,”Feng Xianxian said. “Brother Zheng, you guys go to the tea ceremony. I can go back myself.” ”

“Zheng Zimo had never thought of sending Feng Xianxian back. After all, it was not easy for him to meet the goddess in real life. He was about to go and spar with her. If he were to suddenly leave, anyone would feel regretful. ” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“After all, Feng Xianxian could be seen every day. ”

And it wasn’t easy for his goddess to be seen once!

“Hearing Feng Xianxian’s words, Zheng Zimo immediately went down the pole. “Xianxian, you go back alone and be careful.” ”

“Zheng Zhilan nodded and agreed. “That’s right, Xianxian, you must be careful! If there’s anything, call me and my brother.” ”

Feng Xianxian’s heart skipped a beat. She didn’t even get a chance to breathe and almost choked to death.

She did not expect Zheng Zimo and Zheng Zhilan to really let her go back alone.

“If it were any other time, they would have personally sent her back no matter what. ”

What was this now?

“But the words had already been said. In this situation, Feng Xianxian could not say that she would not go back. She nodded and said, “Don’t worry, I’m not a child anymore. I’ll go back first.” ”
