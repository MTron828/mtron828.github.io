Translator: 549690339

What ye Zao wanted to express was that she could predict that there were exotic beasts and viruses on Europa before she even landed on Europa. Ye Zao was just scaremongering.

“In director Ma’s words, Ye Zao was too autocratic. She wanted everyone to trust her! ”

“Professor Feng and director Ma had been studying Europa for decades. If there really were exotic beasts on Europa, would they not know anything about it? ”

Just wait and see.

“One day, she would expose ye Zao’s lie in front of everyone. ”

She wanted to see how ye Zao would deal with it when the time came?

“Hearing Professor Feng say this, Yu Zifei heaved a sigh of relief. He was really afraid that Professor Feng would take things too far and get into trouble. Now, it seemed that Professor Feng was not as petty as he had imagined. ”

“Yu Zifei stood up with a smile. “Auntie Feng, I’m relieved to see you like this.” ”

“Okay.”Professor Feng nodded. “Don’t worry. Your Auntie Feng has never been a stubborn person.”

“”Then I’ll take my leave first, Auntie Feng,”Yu Zifei said. ” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Okay.”Professor Feng stood up to send Yu Zifei off.

Professor Feng did not stop smiling until Yu Zifei walked out of the door.

“Although ye Zhuo was young, her methods were more powerful than she had imagined. She could actually trick Yu Zifei to such an extent. ”

Yu Zifei did not even think about it. Ye Zao had never landed on Europa. Where did she find out that there was a virus and an alien on Europa?

Could Ye Zao be able to calculate it?

“As long as he thought about it, professor Feng was a little angry. ”

“Fortunately, she had already defected to country C! ”

“Ye Zao did not agree with what she had done, and country C would help her complete it! ”

“With this in mind, Professor Feng let out a deep breath. ”

“She had to prove to everyone that Europa was not dangerous at all. On the contrary, it was a very suitable planet for survival. ”

“If ye Zao gave up on landing on Europa, she would definitely regret it! ”

“At that time, all the resources on Europa would belong to country C, and it had nothing to do with ye Zao! ”

“In the blink of an eye, three days had passed. ”

“Today was the day Yu Zifei, Cen Hai, and the others landed on Mars. ”

“Because Yu Zifei was going to live on Mars for a long time after today, Yu Zifei stayed at his parents’place at night. ”

“During breakfast in the morning, his parents repeatedly reminded him to pay attention to his safety on Mars. ”

“”Zifei, do you want to make a phone call on Mars?”Tian Zhifang asked. ”

“Yu Zifei shook his head. “We can’t make a phone call on Mars Mountain, but we can contact the base through a special communicator. If you need anything, you can call the base.” ”

“Tian Zhifang nodded and said, “Oh right, I’ve prepared some food for you. Remember to bring it with you.” ”

“”No Need, Mom. The food has been prepared by the base.” ”

“”Bring it with you,”Tian Zhifang continued, “The things prepared by the base are prepared by the base. The things I prepared for you can not be bought outside.” ”

“”Okay.”Yu Zifei nodded and put down his chopsticks. “Dad, Mom, it’s getting late. I’m leaving first.” ”

Tian Zhifang stood up as well. “Remember to be careful.”

“I know.”Yu Zifei nodded.

“Father Yu, who had been silent all this while, spoke up at this moment. “I heard that outer space isn’t like Earth. If you’re not used to the situation there, call back immediately. Miss Ye isn’t the kind of person who doesn’t show mercy!” ”

“Okay.”

“Father Yu glanced at Yu Zifei and continued, “Alright, it’s getting late. You should leave quickly! Don’t let everyone wait for You Alone!” ”

“Alright.”Yu Zifei changed into his shoes and walked out.

“Tian Zhifang quickly caught up to him. “Zifei, wait a moment.” ”

“”What’s wrong, Mom?”Yu Zifei turned to look at Tian Zhifang. ”

Tian Zhifang was holding a big bag in her hand. “You forgot the things mom prepared for you. There’s crispy pork and fried dumplings in here. You Can’t buy them outside. Remember to share them with your colleagues.”

“Okay.”Yu Zifei took the bag.

“Looking at Yu Zifei’s back, Tian Zhifang’s eyes were full of worry. ”

“Father Yu said, “Okay, come back quickly! They’re all far away.” ”

“Tian Zhifang said with some worry, “I heard that there are aliens on the alien planet. Do you think our son will encounter aliens? What if he’s kidnapped by aliens? I already said that I won’t let him participate in that Oasis project, but you have to agree! If anything happens to our son, I won’t let you off!” ”

“”Don’t worry, he will be fine.”Father Yu continued, “Miss Ye has already gone to Mars many times. If there really were aliens, Miss Ye would have met them long ago! You Don’t have to worry about nothing here!” ”
