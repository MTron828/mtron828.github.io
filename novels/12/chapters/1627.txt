Translator: 549690339

“Tang Xue smiled and said, “Team leader Cen Jiang, there’s something you still don’t know, right?””

Cen Jiang didn’t say anything and continued with his work.

“Today was the aircraft carrier lift-off ceremony. The entire world’s audience was watching them, and they couldn’t afford to make any mistakes.”

“CEN he said unhappily, “Worker Tang, do you not understand human language or what? Didn’t you hear what Dajiang said? We don’t have the time to entertain you now!””

“Tang Xue wasn’t angry either, she continued, “You guys worked hard to prepare here, but you didn’t know that some people had already run away! “I feel that it’s not worth it for you guys. You guys trusted ye Zhuo so much, but he ran away at the last moment without telling you guys!””

“Who did you say ran away?”Cen Hu raised his head and looked at Tang Xue with his eyes wide open.

“”You really don’t Know?”Tang Xue smiled and said, “Ye Zhuo ran away.””

“”What nonsense are you spouting!”Cen Hu directly stood up and grabbed Tang Xue’s collar, he said angrily, “Who asked you to slander Miss Ye! Miss Ye isn’t that kind of person! She Won’t run away! I want you to immediately apologize to miss ye right now!””

“I’m spouting nonsense?”The corners of Tang Xue’s lips curled up. “Facts speak louder than words. Didn’t you notice that Ye Zhuo never appeared from the beginning to the end?”

“No! Miss Ye won’t run away!”Cen Hu was so angry that his breathing quickened. He looked as if he wanted to strangle Tang Xue to death.

“”If she didn’t run away, where did she go?”Tang Xue didn’t care about Cen Hu’s attitude at all. She continued, “The four of you are too pitiful. You’re about to be sold, and you’re still counting money for others! How pitiful and pathetic!””

“Shut up! Shut your stinky mouth for me!”Cen Hu raised his fist and almost couldn’t control himself.

“Seeing Cen Hu like this, Cen Jiang immediately stood up and stopped Cen Hu. “Cen Hu! Quickly let go of Tang Gong!””

“Although it was Tang Xue who provoked Cen Hu first, if Cen Hu were to make a move, then the nature would be different.”

“Moreover, Tang Xue was a woman.”

“If a grown man were to hit a woman, it would only bring shame to ye Zhuo.”

“”I won’t Let Go!”Cen Hu’s eyes were red as he said, “Unless she apologizes to Miss Ye! Miss ye will not run away!””

“”Let Go!”Cen Jiang said seriously, “How does miss ye usually teach us! Do you want to embarrass Miss Ye!””

“Hearing this, Cen Hu calmed down a little and slowly let go of Tang Xue’s collar.”

Tang Xue tidied up her collar and still had a smile on her face. “You guys are really loyal. It’s a pity that you followed the wrong person! Ye Zao is not worthy of your loyalty at all!”

“”You woman, what nonsense are you talking about!”Cen Hu pointed at Tang Xue angrily. “Do you believe that I will kill you?””

Cen Hu grew up in Pingling and had a straightforward and irritable personality. He worshipped ye Zao very much and could not bear to see others criticize ye Zao.

“Tang Xue smiled and said, “If killing me can bring ye Zao back, then you can kill me, right?””

Cen Hu was very angry and took in large mouthfuls of air.

“Tang Xue continued to provoke Cen Hu. “Unfortunately, even if you kill me, Ye Zao will not come back. All of you, including all of you from Area C, have been played by ye Zao!””

Cen Hu clenched his fists tightly and his entire body was trembling.

“”Forget it, forget it. Don’t bother with this kind of person.”Cen Hai held Cen Hu’s arm. “Big Lake, don’t bother with this kind of person!””

Tang Xue couldn’t be bothered to say anything more to these four idiots. She turned around and walked to the other side.

An Idiot was an idiot.

“If it were anyone else, they would understand with just a little bit. This was an idiot. At this point in time, he was still lying to himself!”

She was simply stupid and adorable.

“Looking at Tang Xue’s back, Cen Hu was so angry that he shouted, “Miss Ye won’t lie to us!””

The corners of Tang Xue’s mouth curled up slightly.

“Just as she walked out of the preparation cabin, Tang Xue saw Tang mi rushing over.”

“Although Tang Mi had had conflicts with Tang Xue before, Tang Xue was still her cousin. Due to their relationship, Tang Mi took the initiative to greet her, “Sis.””

Tang Xue snorted coldly.

Tang Mi now knew to suck up to her?

What a pity.

It was too late!

“Now You Know Your Mistake?”Tang Xue looked at Tang Mi.

Tang Mi was stunned for a moment.

“Tang Xue continued, “Tang Mi, I warned you before. You only have one chance. You Don’t know how to cherish it! You want me to forgive you, right? Sure! Unless you make your mother kneel in front of my mother and apologize to her!”” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Xiao Qing boasted that he was born into a prestigious family, and he had given Tang a lot of attitude before.”

Tang Xue dreamed of making Xiao Qing lower his head in front of Tang to vent her anger.
