“What about family background?”Bai Jingshu asked.

“Elder bai said, “I don’t have any requirements for family background, as long as the boys have no problems with their character.” ”

“”Yes, Grandpa, I understand.”Bai Jingshu nodded. ”

“Elder Bai’s gaze was a little distant as he continued, “Jingshu, you must remember what Grandpa said. A person’s life is only so long. You must not mistreat yourself and let the rest of your life be spent in regret.” ”

“There were some things that could be salvaged if one regretted it when one was young. Once one was old, one could only regret it. ”

“Yes.”Bai Jingshu continued to nod.

“”If anyone dares to make things difficult for you, come and look for grandfather. As long as grandfather is around, no one can bully you!”Although Old Master Bai had already greeted his son and daughter-in-law, he was still a little worried, what if his son and daughter-in-law were making things difficult for Bai Jingshu behind her back? Bai Jingshu was the only junior that he had high hopes for. ”

“He hoped that Bai Jingshu would be able to fulfill his unfulfilled dream when he was young. No matter when or where, she would be able to live for him. ”

“”Alright.”Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “With Grandpa Here, I’m not afraid of anything.” ”

“Good child.”

“As the grandfather and grandson were talking, Bai Mo and Bai Yuanyuan walked over. ”

“Grandfather.”

“Seeing Bai Mo and Bai Yuanyuan, old master bai smiled and said, “Mo Mo and Yuanyuan are here. Sit Down, sit down!” ”

Bai Mo and Bai Yuanyuan sat opposite Old Master Bai.

“Old Master Bai looked at Bai Jingshu and said, “Jingshu, I’ve prepared gifts for Mo Mo and Yuanyuan. Go and get them.” ”

“Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded and got up to get the gifts.

Bai Mo looked at Bai Jingshu’s back with a hint of displeasure in his eyes.

“No matter what, Old Master Bai could only see Bai Jingshu in his eyes. It was as if his granddaughters were invisible. ”

“Bai Jingshu was inferior to her in everything, but in Old Master Bai’s eyes, Bai Jingshu was the most outstanding granddaughter. ”

“Old Master Bai looked at the two of them and said with a smile, “Both of you are my granddaughters. Grandfather has never favored one over the other. Mo Mo and Yuanyuan, have you resolved the issue of your marriage?” ”

“”Grandfather, Yuanyuan and I are still single,”Bai Mo replied. ”

“Old Master Bai looked at Bai Mo., then, he said, “Mo Mo and Yuanyuan, life is only a short few decades. Listen to grandfather’s advice. Don’t be too picky when it comes to finding a boyfriend. The most important thing is your character. Family background is only secondary. When you look at others, others will also look at you.” ”

The most important thing in being a person was to know your own strength.

It would be a lie to say that she did not feel anything when she heard that.

What did old master Bai Mean by that? CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Was he mocking her for not knowing her own limits?

He was really her biological grandfather!

“Although Bai Mo was angry, she did not show it on her face. She smiled and said, “Grandpa, I know. I also want to find a boyfriend as soon as possible. It’s just that I haven’t met a suitable one!” ”

“”Grandpa, Sister Jingshu is older than me and Momo. Why are you only urging me and Momo? is sister Jingshu not your biological granddaughter?”Bai Yuanyuan’s words were neither light nor heavy. It could be said that her words were harsh! ”

“Just then, Bai Jingshu walked over with the gift that old master Bai had prepared. “Grandpa.” ”

“Old Master Bai took the gift and said kindly, “Momo Yuanyuan, this is the blood stone of a level three armored beast. Grandpa had to rely on a lot of connections to get it. I hope that you two sisters can be happy in the future!” ”

The blood stone of a level three armored beast was indeed very valuable.

“However, the gift that old master Bai gave Bai Jingshu was definitely more valuable. ”

“After all, Bai Jingshu was the first to arrive. ”

It was really unfair!

Old Master Bai was not worthy of being a grandfather.

“To be a grandfather like him, it was also amazing! ”

“”Thank you, grandfather.”Bai Mo and Bai Yuanyuan thanked him one by one. ”

“Old Master Bai smiled and said, “Grandfather only has you three granddaughters. If there’s anything good, I’ll naturally keep it for you. Don’t even think about looking at those rascals.” ”

Keep it all for them?

They should be keeping it all for Bai Jingshu!

Even the things that were given to Bai Jingshu were given secretly.

“After leaving Old Master Bai’s place, Bai Yuanyuan looked at Bai Mo and continued, “Momo, what do you think grandfather gave Bai Jingshu?” ”

“Bai Mo said, “What he gave us were all grade-3 Armored Beasts’blood stones. What he gave Bai Jingshu was definitely a top-grade blood stone.” ”

“When she heard this, Bai Jingshu immediately frowned. “This! He’s too biased!” ”

They were both grandfather Bai’s biological granddaughters. What right did he have to treat them so differently?
