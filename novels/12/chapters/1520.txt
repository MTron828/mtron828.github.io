[ oh my God! So she’s really in the entertainment industry. ]

“[ the threshold of China’s scientific research world is really getting lower and lower. In the past, celebrities were called actors in China, and actors were the people with the least social status. But now, an actress can actually join the scientific research world. How funny! ] ”

“[ China’s scientific research world has always been a joke. YC is arrogant and arrogant. It was not easy for her to make some achievements, and now she has personally destroyed herself. I think she doesn’t dare to sign this BET agreement! ] ”

[ it’s normal that she doesn’t dare to sign it! ]

[ hahahaha! This YC is too embarrassing! ]

“The members of the Niu Hu Lu family were furious, but their power was too small. After all, they were facing netizens from all over the world. ”

“At this moment, an account applied to join the Niu Hu Lu family group. ”

It was a very simple note: I am YC.

“When the group manager saw this verification message, he was a little excited, but he quickly calmed down. ”

Many people would play pranks like this when they joined a large group.

The manager opened a temporary chat window and sent a message over. [ send your technology network account over. ]

“The next second, the other party sent a message over. [ Niu Hulu · YC’s Ye. ] ”

Niu Hulu · YC’s Ye?

“Seeing this message, the administrator blurted out excitedly, “Dad!” ”

Dad parachuted into the Admin Group?

“The administrator quickly opened ye Zhuo’s information, and then opened ye Zhuo’s account on Tech, and found that the information on it was exactly the same. ”

Could it be that she was really YC?

“The administrator immediately contacted another administrator. [ hei zi, are you there? ] ”

“Hei Zi replied: [ yes, What’s Wrong? ] ”

“The administrator controlled her excited hands. [ quickly check the verification information, it seems that our dad is Here! ] ”

Hei Zi immediately went to check the group verification information.

“When he saw it, he was stunned too! ”

“All along, they had been chasing YC unilaterally, and YC had never replied to them directly. He did not expect that YC would actually drop a large group today! ”

“Before hei zi could react, the supervisor, big hairy, sent another message. [ how is it? Have you seen it? Is it our dad? ] ”

“Hei Zi immediately replied, [ Yes! It’s Our Dad! I’m going to the group to tell everyone about this good news! ] ”

“Big Hairy was a little worried. If it wasn’t YC’s dad, wouldn’t there be a mistake? [ are you sure it’s our Dad? ] ”

“Hei Zi was a die-hard fan of YC’s father. Every day, he would look at YC’s account a few times. He could clearly distinguish between these high-quality fake accounts. He definitely wouldn’t make a mistake! ”

[ I’m sure and sure! It’s definitely our Father! ]

“After replying to this message, Hei Zi couldn’t wait to open the group chat and share the good news with everyone. ”

“Niu Hulu Administrator No. 1: [ brothers and sisters, let me tell you a piece of good news. Our Dad has descended into a large group! ] ”

Niu Hulu True Water Fragrance Less 1988: [ Really? ]

“Niu Hulu, the most handsome man in the scientific research world: [ F * ck! ] ”

“Niu Hulu, I Love YC, Dad: [ do you have proof? Let Me See! ] ”

“Hei Zi posted a screenshot of the verification information, [ of course it’s true! Look, isn’t this Dad’s account? ] ”

“Niu Hu Lu, the most handsome person in the scientific research world: [ F * ck! It’s really true! ! ] ”

“Niu Hu Lu, happy every day: [ Ahhh! I’m so excited! ] ”

“Niu Hu Lu, ran qi: [ Father! ] ”

The group was filled with people calling him father.

“At this moment, a member of the group silently tagged hei zi. [ manager, hurry up and pass the verification. Let YC’s father come in! ] ”

Hei Zi only reacted when he saw the message. It turned out that he had not passed YC’s application to join the group. He immediately clicked on the verification message and passed the application.

[ Niu Hu Lu · YC has joined the Niu Hu Lu family group! ]

“Niu Hu Lu · Great River: [ welcome, Father! ] ”𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Niu Hulu, the most handsome man in the research world: [ I didn’t think that I would be able to see father in person in my lifetime. I have no regrets in Dying! ] ”

“Niu Hulu, Xinyue Junxi, didn’t know: [ Mom, I’m doing well. I actually saw father YC alive! ] ”

“Niu Hulu, Zhao Baofeng: [ did father YC’s account get stolen? ] ”

“Niu Hulu, the world’s largest sand sculpture: [ brother Zhao, what nonsense are you spouting! How could father get his account stolen! Even if your whole family’s account was stolen, our dad wouldn’t get his account stolen! ] ”

“Niu Hu Lu, vine vine vine: [ brother sand sculpture is right, how could dad be hacked? ] ”
