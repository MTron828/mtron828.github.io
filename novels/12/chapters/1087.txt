“When he heard the word ‘home’, Ye Sen’s heart was instantly filled with warmth. He said with a smile, “After discussing the cooperation with President Xu Tomorrow, we will be going on a business trip the day after tomorrow! When we come back from the business trip, we will get a change of clothes.””

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

At the same time.

On the other side.

“Today was the LABA festival. Zhao Xueyin had promised her father that she would go back to celebrate the festival today. At this moment, she was dragging her suitcase to the apartment building.”

“Xueyin.”A familiar male voice came from the air.

Zhao Xueyin frowned slightly and looked up.

It was Si lui.

“Big Brother Si.”Zhao Xueyin put on a professional fake smile and jogged over.

Si lui pushed the door open and got out of the car. He opened the door of the passenger seat for Zhao Xueyin. “Uncle asked me to come and pick you up.”

“Zhao Xueyin rebuked, “My dad is too much! How could I trouble you with such a Big Festival?””

“”It’s fine.”Si lui took the suitcase from Zhao Xueyin and took it to the trunk. “Anyway, there’s nothing going on at home.””

“Si Lui’s parents had passed away early. There was no one else in the family other than him, because as long as it was a new year, they would stay at the Zhao family.”

“Zhao Xueyin sat in the passenger seat, and the smile on her face disappeared in an instant. When the lawyer sat in the driver’s seat, the smile returned to Zhao Xueyin’s face.”

“After getting into the car, the lawyer took out a cup of milk tea from the incubator and handed it to Zhao Xueyin. “The first cup of milk tea for the LABA Festival.””

“Thank you.”Zhao Xueyin took it with both hands.

“The lawyer smiled and said, “You don’t have to be so polite with me.””

Zhao Xueyin inserted the straw into the cup and took a sip of the milk tea. She did not want to speak anymore.

Tired.

Too tired.

“After dealing with Father Zhao every day, she had to deal with the lawyer again.”

The lawyer was not bad.

“He was excellent in all aspects, but he was not master five after all.”

Zhao Xueyin looked at the lawyer.

Her eyes were filled with regret.

If only the lawyer was master five.

Then she would not have to be so tired.

Things didn’t go as planned.

“After drinking the milk tea, Zhao Xueyin leaned against the back of the chair and fell asleep unknowingly.”

“Xueyin?”

“Xueyin?”The lawyer called out again.

But Zhao Xueyin still didn’t have any reaction.

“From the looks of it, she should have fallen asleep.”

The lawyer held the steering wheel with one hand and took out a white blanket from the storage box on the side with the other hand. He carefully covered Zhao Xueyin with it.

His movements were gentle.

It was as if he was treating a priceless treasure.

The speed of the car was very slow and steady.

“By the time Zhao Xueyin woke up, the car had already entered the vicinity of the Zhao Manor.”

“You’re Awake?”The lawyer tilted his head and looked at Zhao Xueyin.

“Yes.”Zhao Xueyin raised her hand and pressed on her temple. The white blanket slid down her arm.

It was obvious that the lawyer had covered this blanket for her.

Zhao Xueyin sighed in her heart.

The lawyer was putting too much pressure on her.

“At this moment, the lawyer went to the other side and opened the door of the passenger seat. He extended his right hand to Zhao Xueyin. “The ground is frozen. Slow down.””

Zhao Xueyin put her hand on the lawyer’s hand and pulled it down.

“Why are your hands so cold? Are you wearing less clothes?”The lawyer frowned slightly.

“Zhao xueyin smiled and said, “It’s okay. I’m not cold.””

The lawyer took off his down jacket and draped it over Zhao Xueyin’s body. “Quickly put on your clothes. Girls can’t stand the cold.”

“Thank you.”Zhao Xueyin adjusted the down jacket on her body.

Flying Snow glanced past the lawyer’s eyes.

“Under the night sky, the man’s facial features appeared gentle and refined, and he was extraordinarily handsome.”

Zhao Xueyin sighed in her heart once again.

Why wasn’t he master five?

“Seeing Zhao Xueyin looking at him like this, the lawyer said somewhat embarrassedly, “Xueyin, why are you looking at me like that?””

“It’s nothing.”Zhao Xueyin retracted her gaze and very naturally let go of the lawyer’s hand. “Let’s go in.”

“Okay.”Si lui immediately followed Zhao Xueyin’s footsteps.

The two of them walked together into the manor’s Hall.

Today was the LABA festival. The Zhao family’s manor was brightly lit and filled with the festive atmosphere.

“As soon as the two of them walked into the hall, the butler came out to welcome them. “Mr. Si, Miss, you’re back.””

Zhao Xueyin nodded. “Where’s My Father?”

“The butler continued, “Master is waiting for you inside.””

“After passing through the outer hall and the long corridor, they finally arrived at the main hall. Father Zhao was sitting on the sofa. When he saw Si lui, he immediately stood up excitedly. “Ah Lui is back!””

“In the face of Father Zhao’s disregard, Zhao Xueyin did not have any special emotions on her face.”

Because she was already used to it. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“If it wasn’t for the paternity test, Zhao Xueyin would have suspected that Si lui was Father Zhao’s biological son.”
