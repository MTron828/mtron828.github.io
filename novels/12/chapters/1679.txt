“Ye Shu sighed, “I don’t know when he will figure it out!”It was not a good thing that he did not want to find a girlfriend. ”

“”We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. If he is not anxious about this kind of thing, it is useless for others to be anxious,”Zhou Yuelian said. ”

“After the phone call with Ye Shu, Zhou Yuelian started to prepare for dinner. ”

“Lin Shasha asked curiously, “Mom, what did Aunt Shu Say? Can you be considered a success as a Moon Elder?” ”

“I’m afraid not.”Zhou Yuelian shook her head. “Zhuozhuo’s uncle doesn’t want to find a girlfriend yet!”

“After saying that, Zhou Yuelian turned to look at Ye Zhuo and asked curiously, “Zhuozhuo, does your uncle have a girlfriend outside? He’s just too embarrassed to say it.” ”

“I’m not sure.”Ye Zao shook his head slightly.

“Zhou Yuelian said, “He definitely has one! Otherwise, which man doesn’t want a wife? What a pity for such a good little girl!” ”

On the other side.

Beijing.

“After ye Sen hung up the phone, he turned off his phone, afraid that ye Shu would call again. ”

“Ten minutes later, the assistant came to the office. ”

“”President Ye, there’s a lady named Gu downstairs looking for you.” ”

“Do you have an appointment?”Ye Sen was busy with the documents and asked without looking up.

“”No,”the assistant said. ”

“Ye Sen said, “Can’t you see that I’m busy? Those who don’t have an appointment can’t see me!” ”

The assistant nodded. “Okay.”

“Two minutes later, the assistant came to the first floor of the company. “Miss Gu, I’m sorry. President ye is not available to see you now.” ”

“It’s okay.”Gu dening smiled slightly. “Then I’ll have to trouble you to give this to him when he’s free. I’ll be leaving first.”

“”Okay, Miss Gu.”The assistant took the bag from Gu dening with both hands. ”

“After leaving Shengdong Express headquarters, Gu Dening went straight to the hospital. ”

“Gu Dexin had not been feeling well recently and was in the hospital again. When she saw gu dening coming back so soon, she said unhappily, “Why didn’t you talk to Xiao Ye for a while longer?” ”

“GU dening said, “I met his assistant and said that he’s quite busy right now.” ” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Gu dexin frowned slightly. She felt that ye Sen should not be so busy that he did not even have time to meet gu dening. Even if he was busy, Ye Sen would not let his assistant send gu dening away. He continued, “You didn’t call him?” ”

“”His phone is switched off.”Gu Dening put a pillow behind gu dexin and said, “Sis, don’t set him up blindly. Maybe he doesn’t have that intention at all.” ”

“”I think he’s really interested in you,”gu Dexin said. “I’ve always been a good judge of people. Xiaoye is definitely worthy of your lifelong commitment! Maybe he’s really busy today!” ”

“Then.., gU dexin continued, “By the way, our mom called me last time. She said that someone wants to set you up with someone who also works in Beijing. “The family conditions are pretty good. If Xiaoye really can’t do it, you can go back for a blind date.” ”

“”I don’t go on blind dates,”gu dening said. ”

“”Why not?”Gu dexin continued, “I asked you to cultivate a relationship with Xiaoye, but you’re too shy to ask. You Don’t want to go on blind dates. What do you want? Do you want to go to heaven? Let me tell you, Dening, women only have a few years of youth. When you turn 30, there will be no market at all!” ”

“Gu Dening was 28 this year, only two years away from turning 30. ”

“Both her parents were anxious, and even gu dexin, her sister, was anxious. ”

“”When I was your age, even a child could be a bystander! Look at you, you’re still acting like a child!” ”

“Gu dening didn’t say a word, but quickly helped Gu Dexin change the medicine bottle. ”

And on Ye Sen’s side.

“After work, the assistant came over with something. “President Ye, Miss Gu asked me to pass this to you.” ”

“”Miss Gu, which Miss Gu?”Ye Sen took the thing with a puzzled look. ”

“After opening it, there was a suit inside and two boxes of cold medicine. ”

“Ye Sen suddenly remembered that Gu Dening was at a cocktail party the day before yesterday. Because it was quite cold when he went back at night, he lent the suit to Gu Dening. He would catch a cold if he went back! ”

So this thing must have been sent by Gu Dening.

“Thinking of this, Ye Sen immediately turned to look at his assistant. “Where is she?” ”

“Who?”The assistant was stunned.

“Ye Sen said, “Miss Gu! where is Miss Gu who sent me the Thing?” ”

“She left after delivering the Thing!”The assistant said.

“Why did you let her go! Why didn’t you come and inform me!”Ye Sen was almost angered to death by this idiotic assistant.
