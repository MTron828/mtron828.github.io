“Okay.”The assistant nodded.

“Eva then knocked on the door. “Dr. Cara, are you asleep?” ”

“After knocking for a long time, there was still no answer. ”

Eva took out her phone and dialed Dr. Cara’s private number.

“However, Dr. Cara’s phone was also in a state of no answer. ”

Did something really happen?

“This time, Eva could not stay calm. She turned to her assistant and asked, “Do you know where the key to Dr. Cara’s office is?” ”

“Yes.”The assistant nodded.

“Go and get the key!”Eva said.

“”Okay, I’ll go now.”The assistant immediately ran to get the key. ”

“The key was in the office outside, and the assistant came back very quickly. “Here.” ”

“Eva took the key and opened the door. The key had just been inserted in, but the lock could not be turned at all. ”

The door had been locked from the inside!

Eva frowned.

“The assistant asked anxiously, “What’s Going On?” ”

“The door seems to have been locked from the inside!”Eva said.

“Then what do we do now?”

Eva thought for a moment. “Go and call a few people over. We’ll break the door open!”

Break down the door?

The assistant looked at Eva in surprise.

“Eva saw that the assistant was not moving and said, “What are you still standing there for! Go and get someone!” ”

“”Oh,”the assistant finally reacted. “Okay!” ”

“Soon, the assistant called two strong bodyguards over. ”

“For safety reasons, Dr. Cara’s door was made of a special material. It could not be opened so easily! ”

“The two bodyguards bumped into each other again and again, but the door remained the same and did not even tremble. ”

“Seeing this, Eva could only look for a professional lock-picking expert. ”

The expert studied it for a while before opening the door.

“After opening the door, Eva and her assistant immediately ran inside. “Dr. Cara!” ”

“After entering the house, she turned a corner and saw Dr. Cara sitting in front of the computer, the computer screen covering his face. ”

“Seeing Dr. Cara sitting in front of the computer in perfect condition, Eva heaved a sigh of relief. “Dr. Cara, are you okay?” ”

Dr. Cara did not respond immediately after saying that.

“The assistant felt that it was a little strange and called out again, “Dr. Cara?” ”

But Dr. Cara was still sitting there without saying a word.

The assistant and Eva looked at each other and saw the confusion in each other’s eyes.

What was going on?

Eva narrowed her eyes and took a few steps forward. Only then did she see that Dr. Cara was holding his head with one hand as if he was sleeping.

“Eva thought that Dr. Cara was sleeping, so she would not disturb him. However, she was a little worried. She leaned over slightly and called, “Dr. Cara.” ”

Dr. Cara was still the same as before.

This was very wrong!

“Eva had followed Dr. Cara for so many years, but she had never seen Dr. Cara sleep so soundly. ”

Eva reached out and pushed Dr. Cara. “Doctor?”

“It was just a light push, but in the next second, Dr. Cara was pushed to the ground. ”

Bang!

Eva was so scared that her face turned pale. “Dr. Cara!”

The assistant beside her was also very scared.

What happened to Dr. Cara?

The assistant immediately ran over to help Dr. Cara. Only then did he realize that Dr. Cara’s body was already stiff. He was still lying on the ground and was still sitting at his desk.

“Ah!”The assistant was so scared that he screamed.

Eva immediately contacted the emergency phone and the police.

“Soon, the police and the ambulance arrived. ”

“After the Doctor’s examination, it was confirmed that Dr. Cara had been dead for three hours. He had been injected with a special drug while he was conscious, which caused his body to remain in a stiff state. ”

Dr. Cara occupied an important position in the scientific research community of C Nation. The police immediately locked down the entire experimental base and investigated it one by one.

But the real murderer had already run away. What else could they find out?

...

Cen’s base.

Cen Shaoqing was flipping through the Buddhist scriptures when he suddenly received a message on his phone.

“Cen Shaoqing put down the Buddhist scriptures and picked up his phone. After reading the message clearly, the corners of his mouth slowly curled up into a faint smile. ”

“Very soon, the news of Dr. Cara’s death exploded on the entire internet. ”

“For a time, many people clapped their hands in joy. ”

“[ the heavenly axiom has a cycle of reincarnation, retribution is not pleasant! ] ”

“[ although scientific research does not differentiate between national boundaries, professor Cara is really too disgusting. This time, it is really satisfying! ] ”

“[ this is retribution for evil, right? ] ”

[ hurry up and eat. ]

“When ye Zao saw this news, he was stunned. ”

“She had not even had the time to make a move, how did cara disappear? ”

Was it an accident?

“Ye Zao felt that things were not that simple. He put his phone back into his pocket, closed his computer, and walked out of the door. ”
