Chapter 218: 092: he doesn’t understand the world of big shots! Slapping faces too fast is like a tornado! 3

Translator: 549690339

There are more than 20 companies in total!

“Among them, there are two listed express delivery companies. ”

“Ye Sen was dumbfounded when he saw them. He was originally full of confidence, but at this moment, it was as if someone had poured a bucket of cold water on him. ”

It was cold from head to toe.

Even the listed companies had come. What Hope did a small company like him have.

Xiao Hu’s eyes were full of disappointment.

“Let’s go back.”Ye Sen said with a disappointed face.

“Why do we have to go?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly.

Ye Sen’s gaze moved back and forth between the crowd. “We are not their competitors.”

“”How do you know we are not their competitors if you don’t try? Uncle, running away at the last minute is not your style!”Ye Zhuo continued. ”

“Xiao Hu stood out to explain, “Miss Ye, you may not know this, but these express delivery companies are bigger than us. You Should Know About Wind Express, right? Their group went public last year! Compared to them, we have no chance of winning at all.” ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled slightly, “Just because they are big and well-known doesn’t mean that their business capabilities are better than ours! “There isn’t a large group that hasn’t been developed from a small company! “How can you be so sure that we will lose to them without even trying? “If even we don’t have confidence in ourselves, then there is really no chance of winning!” ”

Xiao Hu felt that ye Zao was a fantasy.

It was just a theory on paper.

How could an arm win a thigh?

“If he continued to waste his time here, it would only be a waste of time. ”

“Ye Sen raised his head and looked at Ye Zao. “Zao Zao, what do you mean?” ”

“”What I mean is that we absolutely can not back down at the last minute! And we definitely can not look down on ourselves!”Her voice was very soft and faint, but it carried a magical power that could calm people’s hearts. ”

“Okay!”Ye Sen nodded. “Uncle will listen to you!”

“President Ye?”Xiao Hu was stunned.

Ye Sen was too easy to fool!

He actually listened to such a fairy tale...

“Ye Sen turned to look at Xiao Hu, his face full of seriousness. “Listen to it.” ”

“Xiao Hu did not have any expression on his face and said, “OH.”. ”

“At this moment, someone came over to greet ye Sen. “Old Ye!” ”

“”President Xu,”Ye Sen said politely. ”

“This president Xu was called Xu Dadong, and he also ran an express delivery company. ”

“Xu Dadong passed a cigarette to ye Sen and said, “Old Ye, do you also like this Bill?”? ”

“Ye Sen smiled and said, “People die for money and birds die for food. Aren’t we just trying to get higher and higher?” ”

“”You’re right.”Xu Dadong blew out a smoke ring, “But looking at the situation today, small companies like us don’t have much hope! Instead of wasting time here, why don’t we go home early and develop other businesses! I’m preparing to go back. What About You?” ”

“In fact, Xu Dadong wasn’t the only one who was preparing to leave. Many small companies had already left early. ”

“Ye Sen told him the truth, “I plan to give it a try.” ”

“”Give it a try?”Xu Dadong laughed out loud as if he had heard a good joke, he continued, “I’m not the one who said it! Old Ye! Look at those companies that are ranked ahead of us. Which one of them isn’t more capable than us? An egg can’t touch a rock, so why are you wasting your time here?” ”

“Hearing that, Ye Zao raised his eyes slightly. “It’s fine that uncle Xu looks down on himself, but now he wants to stop my uncle from looking down on himself?” ”

Xu Dadong was stunned.

What a pretty little girl!

“This is?”

“Ye Sen smiled apologetically. “President Xu, I’m sorry. This is my niece. A child doesn’t know his limits when he speaks. President Xu, don’t lower yourself to her level.” ”

“Xu Dadong waved his hand. “I’m already an adult, what’s the point of arguing with a little girl? Little girl, it’s good for young people to be confident, but don’t be blindly confident. Blindly confident is arrogant!” ”

“”The prerequisite for confidence is that you have the capital.”Ye Zhuo continued calmly. “You have a biased view of people. Even if I’m being modest, you’ll still think that I’m being arrogant.” ”

The little girl had such a powerful mouth!

Xu Dadong turned to look at Ye Zhuo. “So you’re saying that your uncle can win the cooperation case?”

“”There’s a 50% chance,”ye Zhuo replied. ”

“Xu Dadong’s eyes were filled with mockery. “Looking forward to this 50% chance, you might as well go buy a lottery ticket. Who knows, you might win the first prize!” ”

The Shengdong Express Company that Ye Sen ran was even smaller than his company.

“Even if one thought with their toes, they should know that Toaeon would not choose them. ” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Toaeon was not a fool!

“Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly. “Practice is the only criterion to test the truth. No matter how much you say, it’s useless. Uncle Xu, just wait and see.” ”
