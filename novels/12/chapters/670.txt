“Your mother taught me how to Cook!”Lin Jincheng glanced at ye Shu.

“This sentence reminded ye Shu of her memories, and a faint smile appeared on her face.”

“”Ah Shu, what do you want to eat?”Lin Jincheng asked.”

Ye Shu thought for a moment. “Stir-fried shredded pork with green peppers.”

“Hearing this, the corners of Lin Jincheng’s mouth curled up into a smile. “Okay.””

Stir-fried shredded pork with green peppers was a very common dish.

It was also the dish that ye Shu had taught him personally all those years ago — stir-fried shredded pork with green peppers.

“What about the two of you?”Lin Jincheng turned to look at Ye Zhuo and Lin Ze.

“Ye Zhuo said, “Yeah, I want to eat Mapo Tofu.””

“Ye Zhuo had originally wanted to order a fish head with double peppers, but he was afraid that Lin Jincheng wouldn’t know how to cook it, so he chose the simplest dish.”

“Ah Ze?”

“Lin Ze originally wanted to say that he could eat anything, but he was afraid that it would hurt Lin Jincheng. He continued, “Curry beef.””

“”Okay, I’ll do it right away.”Lin Jincheng walked to the kitchen.”

Ye Shu followed his footsteps. “Then I’ll Be Your Assistant.”

“Okay.”Lin Jincheng nodded.

“Soon, Lin Jincheng cooked five dishes and a soup that looked very good.”

“There were shredded green pepper and pork ordered by ye Shu, Mapo Tofu ordered by ye Zao, Beef Curry ordered by Lin Ze, and two dishes that ye Zao and ye Shu liked to eat boiled fish and prawns with tomato sauce.”

The last soup was silver fish soup.

“”Dad, your cooking is not bad!”Ye Zao didn’t expect Lin Jincheng’s cooking to be so good.”

“Lin Jincheng smiled and said, “A great teacher produces a great disciple!””

“Under the light, Ye Shu’s face was a thin layer of red.”

The family of four was happy and harmonious. Even the meow of brother Meow was much more cheerful than before.

“Ye Zhuo scooped up brother Meow from the ground. While eating, he stroked the cat.”

“After eating, Lin Jincheng instructed the servants to bring the chicken soup that had been prepared in advance to Old Lady Lin in the hospital.”

“When the servants brought the chicken soup to the hospital, Feng Qianqian was still kneeling at the door.”

“Normally, the maid would definitely call her Miss Feng. However, the incident that happened at the Lin family this morning was related to Feng Qianhua. When the maid saw Feng Xianxian, she could only walk around.”

Feng Xianxian had been kneeling outside the door for more than six hours. She looked haggard and even her lips had turned pale.

“When the security guard saw the maid, he immediately opened the door and let her in.”

“The maid walked in with a thermos box. “Old Madam, President Lin asked me to bring you chicken soup.””

Old Madam Lin lay on the hospital bed and turned to look at the maid. “Jin City didn’t come?”

The maid shook her head.

Old Madam Lin Sighed. “What about Qingxuan?”

The maid opened the thermos box. “Mr. Fourth isn’t back yet.”

Old Madam Lin didn’t say anything else. She took the chicken soup from the maid and took a sip.

The chicken soup was just right.

The fragrance assailed her nostrils.

“After drinking the chicken soup, Old Mrs. Lin handed the bowl to the servant. “Is the one outside still kneeling?””

The servant naturally knew who old Mrs. Lin was referring to. She nodded. “I was still kneeling when I first arrived.”

Still kneeling.

Old Mrs. Lin had been thinking a lot this afternoon as she lay in bed.

It was all her fault in the past.

“She had trusted Feng Qianhua wrongly, which was why Feng Qianhua had caused the Lin family to suffer so badly.”

But she did not do it on purpose.

She had also been deceived!

“If Feng Qianhua had not deceived her and poisoned her to control her, she would not have become like this.”

“In other words, she was also a victim!”

But now.

“She, the victim, was unable to obtain the forgiveness of her son, daughter-in-law, and granddaughter.”

It was said that all parents in the world were good.

“Moreover, she had been deceived.”

Why was Lin Jin Cheng unwilling to forgive her?

“Thinking of this, old madam Lin felt very wronged. Her eyes turned red and she almost choked.”

“She was bedridden, but no one came to visit her.”

“If she had known this would happen, why would she have had so many children?”

“Seeing her like this, the servant was shocked. “Old Madam, Are You Alright?””

Old Madam Lin held back her sobs. “I’m fine. Go out and let her in.”

Her? 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“The servant was stunned for a moment before saying carefully, “Are you referring to Miss Feng?””

Old Madam Lin nodded.

She wanted to see what Feng Xianxian wanted to say to her.

“Alright.”

“The maid walked to the door and said, “Miss Feng, the old lady wants you to go in for a while.””

“Hearing that, a glimmer of light flashed across Feng Xianxian’s lowered eyes. After a short while, she stood up from the floor with the help of the door frame.”

“As she had kneeled for too long, the blood circulation in her legs was not circulating, causing her legs to be in pain and weak. She almost fell down. The maid quickly supported her and said, “Let me help you in.””
