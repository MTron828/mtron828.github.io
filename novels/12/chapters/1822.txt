Li Yueyue’s footsteps paused slightly. She turned around and saw an exquisite-looking young man in a suit with handsome features. He was a handsome man!

“Most importantly, Li Yueyue actually felt that she had seen this handsome man somewhere before. ”

“However, she could not remember where she had seen him before. ”

Perhaps she had remembered wrongly!

“After a while, Li Yueyue smiled and said, “Are you talking to me?” ”

“”Yes.”The young man nodded slightly and continued, “You dropped your bank card.” ”

“After saying that, the young man handed Li Yueyue a bank card. ”

“Seeing the familiar bank card, Li Yueyue immediately reached out to take it and thanked him. “Thank you!” ”

“You’re welcome.”

“After saying that, the young man walked to the other side. ”

“Looking at his back, Li Yueyue’s gaze deepened. She suddenly felt that Ouyang Nai wasn’t that handsome anymore! ”

The young man walked straight to an Audi parked by the side of the road.

“Seeing someone get in the car, the man sitting in the front passenger seat turned around and said, “Brother Wei, where did you go? Did you have a romantic encounter?” ”

“”I ran into a small matter.”Lin Weiwei looked down at his watch, his expression unchanged. “Has party B arrived yet?” ”

“”Not yet,”the man replied. ”

“Lin Weiwei turned on his laptop and said, “Have you prepared the information?” ”

“”Brother Wei, are you still worried about me?” ”

“Lin Weiwei didn’t say anything. After a moment, he raised his head and said, “We can set off now.” ”

“As soon as he said that, the driver started the engine and drove away. ”

Li Yueyue also got on the bus and headed in the direction of the school.

“Thirty minutes later, the bus stopped at the East Campus of Beijing University. ”

“As soon as she got off the bus, Li Yueyue saw a familiar figure. ”

It was Ouyang Nai.

“When she saw Ouyang Nai again, Li Yueyue was only left with a strong sense of disgust. ”

“Li Yueyue was a person who did not easily accept a relationship. Since she had accepted Ouyang Nai, she had already made plans to continue the conversation. ”

She had even planned the future of the two of them.

Who knew that reality would actually give her a hard slap.

“Li Yueyue moved her gaze away and wanted to go around Ouyang Nai. However, on second thought, she did not do anything shameful. Why did she want to avoid Ouyang Nai? If she wanted to avoid him, Ouyang Nai would have to avoid her. ”

“Thinking of this, Li Yueyue straightened her back and felt much more confident in her heart. ”

Ouyang Nai turned around and saw Li Yueyue following behind him.

This Li Yueyue was also disgusting!

“He had already said that they had broken up, but Li Yueyue still stubbornly followed him. ”

“A girl, how could she be so Shameless? ”

“Ouyang Nai’s eyes were filled with disgust as she stopped in her tracks, she pointed at Li Yueyue and said, “Li Yueyue! Are You F * cking crazy? Didn’t I tell you clearly on wechat? Break Up! You Can’t understand human language! Or do you think this is especially interesting?” ”

Li Yueyue was dumbfounded.

She didn’t expect Ouyang Nai to suddenly stop in her tracks. She didn’t expect Ouyang Nai to point at her nose and scold her.

“”Ouyang Nai, are you crazy? Did I provoke you?”Li Yueyue asked. ”

“”Who is the one who is crazy?”Ouyang nai continued, “Li Yueyue, I will tell you for the last time, we have broken up! I will not like a country bumpkin like you, please give up! Don’t follow me anymore! If you are not disgusting, I am disgusted!” ”

“It was very disgusting, Ouyang Nai felt like she was about to vomit. ”

“”Who followed you? Ouyang Nai, do you think you are some Prince Charming? I, Li Yueyue, have to have you?”Li Yueyue was about to be angered to death by Ouyang Nai! ”

It had to be said that Ouyang Nai had really hidden it too well before. She did not notice that Ouyang Nai was actually such a person.

“Ouyang Nai looked at Li Yueyue. That gaze was like looking at a clown again, “Li Yueyue, stop pretending! I know what you are thinking! But you have to know that you and I are not from the same world. How many toads have you seen that can eat the meat of a Swan?” ”

“Crazy!”Li Yueyue was so angry that she spat and turned around to leave.

Ouyang Nai looked at Li Yueyue’s back and narrowed his eyes.

Li Yueyue was really good-looking and her figure was also well-proportioned. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Unfortunately, her family background was a little inferior. ”

She was never the same as him.

“Li Yueyue was about to cry from the Shameless Ouyang Nai. At this moment, her phone rang. Li Yueyue picked up the phone and a deep male voice came from the other side, “Yuebao!” ”

“”Dad.”Hearing her father’s voice, Li Yueyue couldn’t help but cry. ”

“Hearing this, father li said nervously, “What’s wrong with Yuebao? Did Someone Bully You? Tell Dad, Dad will fly over immediately to avenge you! Yuebao, don’t be afraid, Dad Is Here!” ”
