“At the end of her speech, Qiu Di faced everyone and bowed. ”

“Thank you for never giving up on Miss Ye. I believe that Miss Ye will definitely be very happy in heaven.”

Qiu Di’s attitude made people a little confused. They didn’t know what she wanted to do.

“Furthermore, she was a lady. ”

“Qiu di discreetly sized up everyone below the stage, then, she said, “Actually, I’ve always been very envious of Miss Ye. When Miss Ye was my age, she was already well-established. “As for me, I’m still ordinary. If it wasn’t for the fact that I was fated to meet Miss ye more than ten years ago, I’m afraid I would still be an ordinary person up until now.” ”

“More than ten years ago?” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Someone in the audience raised a question. “What happened more than ten years ago?”

These were all people who had been arranged in advance by Qiu Di.

“Today, she was determined to make everyone submit to her and kowtow to her three times. ”

“Qiu di continued, “More than ten years ago, Miss Ye was still a wandering orphan. By chance, she was brought to my home. At that time, my father saw that she was the same age as me and felt sorry for her, so he bought her to be my companion... ... looking at Miss Ye who was the same age as me, I really couldn’t bear to use her as a servant, so I addressed her as Miss Ye’s sister. I saw that Miss Ye really yearned for freedom, so three days later, I gave Miss Ye a sum of money to let her regain her freedom “... although I only spent a few days with Miss Ye, that period of time was the happiest time in my life. Until now, I still miss that period of time very much. Unfortunately, I can’t go back.” ”

“Hearing this, the audience began to discuss animatedly. ”

Everyone was very clear about ye Zao’s background.

“But they did not know that ye Zao had actually worked as a servant for Qiu Di. If that was the case, Qiu Di was also ye Zao’s servant. ”

“It had happened more than ten years ago. Now That Ye Zao was no longer around, they had no way of verifying the authenticity of these words. ”

“Qiu Di was very satisfied with everyone’s performance, she continued, “It was already twelve years later when I met Miss ye again. At that time, Miss Ye was already famous throughout the world, Miss Ye. “And I was still the same me from back then. However, Miss Ye did not have the slightest intention of looking down on me. She still addressed me as a sister and even said that she wanted to repay the favor from twelve years ago... “But to me, what happened twelve years ago was just a piece of cake. How could I possibly ask Miss Ye to repay the favor? Moreover, I had never thought of asking Miss ye to repay the favor ”

“”Until one night, Miss Ye suddenly came to me. She said that she was about to start a very important experiment. If this experiment was successful, it would benefit the entire S galaxy! “But at the same time, this experiment was also very dangerous. I tried to persuade Miss Ye to stop this plan, but Miss Ye was a research maniac. Her heart was set on making the s galaxy have a better tomorrow. No matter how I tried to persuade her, she was unmoved. The night before the start of the experiment, miss ye called me into her room and told me about the failure of the experiment.” ”

“At this point, Qiu Di’s face was covered in tears. She looked as if she and ye Zao were really good sisters. ”

Tears were the easiest to infect people.

“Seeing her like this, the people below the stage couldn’t help but have red eyes and sniffles. ”

“Qiu Di choked with sobs, then she said, “That night, Miss ye handed over the management rights of the Ye family’s base to me, and also handed over the heavy responsibility of managing the state of Chang Yue to me. Afraid that I would be unable to convince the crowd, she even gave me this phoenix robe! If everyone doesn’t believe me, you can take a look. This is the seal of the Ye family’s base, and this is the power of attorney.” ”

“After she finished speaking, an assistant came up to the stage with two items. ”

“”Oh right, Ye Han can also clear my name.” ”

“”Ye Han?”Yu Zhenfei stood up and said, “As far as I know, Team Leader Ye has already changed his name to Wu Han! Since Miss Qiu Di and Miss Ye Are Sisters, why did you change team leader Ye’s name?” ”

“”I didn’t change ye Han’s name,”Qiu di continued, “To be precise, it was miss ye who changed it.” ”

“Yu zhenfei frowned and said, “Miss Ye changed it! How is that possible! Autumn flute! Do you really take US people as Fools? !” ”

Why did ye Zhuo Change Ye Han’s name out of the Blue?

“Autumn flute said, “Miss ye changed not only ye Han’s name, but also ye Han’s memories.” ”

“Speaking up to this point.., autumn flute continued, “Miss Ye and ye Han have a deep brother-sister relationship. She was afraid that after she left, Ye Han would be unable to accept this reality, so she changed ye Han’s memories and changed ye Han’s name to Wu Han. Miss ye put in a lot of effort just to not make ye Han too sad! “If you don’t believe me, you can ask ye Han to come over now. Everyone can try and see if ye Han has lost his memory!” ”
