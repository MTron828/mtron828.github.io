“Moreover, you’re even slapping her in front of Song Chenyu. Isn’t this slapping her in the face?”

“Song Chenyu said softly, “Miss Ye is fifth master’s girlfriend after all. It’s normal for him to lend knight number five to Miss Ye.””

Cen Yuyan frowned slightly.

“Could it be that in Cen Shaoqing’s heart, as an elder sister, she was inferior to an outsider.”

“After all, as an elder sister, she could not even borrow Cen Shaoqing’s car.”

What right did ye Zao have?

“”I think Shaoqing is possessed!”CEN Yuyan continued, “Chenyu, don’t leave any face for ye Zao later! Just crush her directly! Otherwise, she will really think that she is something!””

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “Yuyan, she is fifth master’s girlfriend after all. Isn’t it a little bad to be too extreme?”” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“”What’s not good about that?”Cen Yuyan frowned and said, “To tell you the truth, I have long disliked ye Zao! Moreover, this is a competition to begin with. If you keep giving in to her, how can it be called a competition!””

Song Chenyu was in a difficult position.

“Cen Yuyan held song Chenyu’s hand. “Chenyu! You have to promise me that you can’t give in to her later on the race track! Otherwise, I’ll be angry!””

“”Yuyan, is there a need to be so serious?””

“”Of course there’s a need!”Song Chenyu was too kind. If she didn’t explain properly, Cen Yuyan was afraid that she would go easy on Ye Zhuo on the race track.”

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “Okay, okay, okay! I’ll listen to you! I promise I won’t give in to Miss Ye.””

“”That’s right.”Song Chenyu was a person who kept his word. Hearing her words, Cen Yuyan was relieved.”

“Song Chenyu continued, “Yuyan, aren’t you being too serious?””

“”Of course I have to be serious about the competition.”CEN Yuyan continued, “If I’m not serious, any Tom, Dick, or Harry will think that they can be compared to you in the future! “I Just Want Ye Zhuo to know that the circle is different, so don’t force your way in!””

How could ye Zhuo be qualified to be a person in this circle?

His eating style was ugly!

“Song Chenyu patted Cen Yuyan’s hand, “Miss Ye is fifth master’s girlfriend after all. The eldest, second, and third sisters at home, as well as the old lady and Aunt Xiang, all like her very much. Don’t be so stubborn! “I believe that Miss ye must have her own personality and charm. Otherwise, fifth master wouldn’t have chosen her.””

“”It’s all because of my grandmother!”Cen Yuyan was very angry at the mention of this. “My grandmother is old, and it’s inevitable that her eyes will go blurry from old age!””

“If not for old Madam Cen’s actions, the person who was accompanying Cen Yuyan now would be song Chenyu.”

“At this moment, two cars stopped on the race track.”

One was song Chenyu’s exclusive race car.

The other was Cen Shaoqing’s knight No. 5.

“Ye Zhuo recognized Cen Shaoqing’s car just like that. “That Bugatti EB Veyron 16.4Pur Sang, is it yours?””

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Then I’ll go over first.”

“”Wait a moment,”Cen Shaoqing continued.”

Ye Zao raised his eyebrows. “What’s Wrong?”

Cen Shaoqing reached out and caressed her ear. His fingers brushed past her scalp and tied up her loose hair. His movements were extremely gentle. “It’s more convenient this way.”

“Ever since he had confirmed his relationship with ye Zao, a black rubber band had appeared on Cen Shaoqing’s wrist.”

“Seeing this scene, everyone was dumbfounded.”

No one had expected Cen Shaoqing to be so tender.

“Song Chenyu’s gaze swept past them, but there were no ripples in his eyes. “Yuyan, I’ll go over first.””

Cen Yuyan nodded and gestured at her to cheer for her.

“There were a few people present who were song Chenyu’s fans. They all shouted, “Go, Chenyu!””

Ye Zao also walked towards the race track.

“”Be careful,”Cen Shaoqing instructed her.”

“Don’t worry.”

“He ziteng followed behind and said, “Go, God!””

Ye Zao did not even turn his head and made an ‘OK’gesture.

“Looking at Ye Zao’s back, he ziteng turned to Cen Shaoqing and said in a low voice, “Fifth brother, I really didn’t expect you to take Knight No. 5 out for fifth sister-in-law to compete.””

Cen Shaoqing counted the Buddha beads in his hand and opened his thin lips. “I even gave my whole body to her. Why do I still care about a car?”

He ziteng was stunned.

TSK TSK TSK.

Look at what he said.

It seemed that Cen Shaoqing had really fallen into this trap this time.

Maybe he would still be a strict wife in the future!

“He ziteng was very curious about Cen Shaoqing’s appearance when he became a strict wife. “Fifth brother, will you be strict with your wife in the future?””

“”Have you ever heard of strict with your husband?”CEN Shaoqing continued, “I am a man of my word in front of burning!””
