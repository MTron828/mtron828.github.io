Chapter 44: Illegitimate Daughter

Since she couldn’t even read Chinese characters, it was probably pretty embarrassing for Ye Shu to bring her here.

The contempt in Ye Shuang’s eyes became more and more obvious, and she perfunctorily welcomed Ye Shu, Ye Sen, and Ye Zhuo in.

“Dad, Mom, Little Sui! Little Shu and Little Sen are here.”

A row of people sat on the sofa in the living room.

They were Ye Shu’s parents, Ye Dafu and Yao Cuifen, and Ye Shu’s third sister, Ye Sui.

Speaking of which, Ye Dafu and Yao Cuifen were also an interesting pair of parents. Among these five children, their favorite was their second son, Ye Shuai. After him, the favored their eldest daughter, Ye Shuang.

This was because Ye Shuang had the ability to marry a good husband and support her parents financially.

In fact, Ye Shuang always had the final say in the Ye family. She was literally an unwavering presence. All major and minor matters of the Ye family could only be carried out with her consent.

Even the second son, Ye Shuai, who was the favorite son of the Ye parents, had to bow down before Ye Shuang.

When they heard Ye Shuang’s words, Ye Dafu and Yao Cuifen acted rather indifferently. They did not even raise their eyes to look at the guests who had just arrived. It was obvious that they did not like Ye Shu and Ye Sen.

“Father and mother,” Ye Sen called out nonchalantly

Ye Sen always had a problem with his parents. He had never brought up all the biasness and favoritism by his parents during his younger years.

Back then, when Ye Shuai got married, his family didn’t have enough rooms to cater for the newlyweds. Hence, despite being only seventeen years old, Ye Sen was chased out of the house by his parents.

Helpless, Ye Sen had no choice but to seek refuge with Ye Shu.

Later, when his parent’s house was demolished and divided into four houses, his parents left all of them to Ye Shuai.

It was a common saying that all parents doted on their children. However, sometimes, Ye Sen doubted whether he was even his parents’ biological child.

Ye Sen had a bone to pick with his parents. Similarly, Ye Dafu and Yao Cuifen also disliked Ye Sen very much.

In their eyes, Ye Sen and Ye Shu were the two most useless children in the family.

Ye Sen did not like to study since he was young. He was a gangster in his class. He dropped out of school at a young age and became a part-time worker. Now, he was already in his thirties, but he was still single!

In their opinion, Ye Shu was even worse.

Ye Shu was the most beautiful daughter in the family. The old couple hoped that Ye Shu could marry into a good family and help out her family in the future. They did not expect that this wretched daughter of theirs would actually get pregnant before marriage!

She was a disgrace to their family!

Following Ye Sen’s footsteps, Ye Shu also greeted her parents and introduced them to Ye Zhuo. “Zhuo Zhuo, this is your grandpa and grandma. This is your third aunt.”

“Grandpa, Grandma, Third Aunt.”

Ye Dafu and Yao Cuifen responded indifferently. They did not so much as smile at Ye Zhuo.

Ye Sui smiled and said to Ye Shu, “Little Shu, your biological daughter is really beautiful! I wonder how are her academic results? How does she usually rank in the class?”

Before Ye Shu and the others arrived, Ye Sui had heard that Ye Shu’s biological daughter could not even hold a candle to one-tenth of Mu Yourong.

Mu Yourong was an outstanding student in her class!

On the other hand, Ye Zhuo could not even recognize Chinese characters!

What was a person who could not even recognize Chinese characters called?

A fool!

Children usually take after their parents. Even if someone so lowly like Ye Zhuo was raised in a wealthy family, she was still a good-for-nothing, just like her stupid mother. She was unlike Mu Yuorong, who evidently excelled in all parts of her life despite being brought up by a useless person.

Ye Sui was very regretful now. When Mu Yourong was still her niece, she had not treated Mu Yourong well. If she had known that Mu Yourong was the true daughter of a wealthy family, she would definitely have treated Mu Yourong as her ancestor!

It was too late to say anything now.

When it came to the topic of education, Ye Shuang’s face was full of superiority. One had to know that her two daughters were both top students!

Ye Zhuo could not even compare to the wisdom on her daughter’s pinky finger.

Without waiting for Ye Zhuo to answer, Ye Shuang raised her head and looked at Ye Zhuo, “Your name is Ye Zhuo, right? It’s okay if your grades aren’t good. Although your two cousins’ grades are average, it shouldn’t be a problem for them to teach you. If you have any questions that you don’t understand, you can ask them.”

Ye Sui took the opportunity to flatter her eldest sister. “Big Sister, don’t be so humble! If Xuan Xuan and Xue Xue’s grades are average, then what does our Ziyue count as? Doesn’t that mean she’s not even worthy of being called a bad student?”

The people that Ye Sui was most jealous of were Ye Shuang and Ye Shu.

Ye Shu was prettier than her, and Ye Shuang had married into a better family. To top it off, Ye Shuang even had two good daughters whom she could show off to keep up with appearances.

However, although Ye Sui was jealous of Ye Shuang, she did not show it. After all, Ye Shuang’s lived a better life than her. Ye Shuang’s husband, Lin Haifu, was famously known as the miracle doctor in the Yunjing Province, and he knew many wealthy and influential people. Therefore, she was always sucking up to Ye Shuang, while burying any jealousy that she felt toward her eldest sister deep in her heart. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Who did not like flattery?

Ye Sui’s flattery pleased Ye Shuang immensely. “That’s true. I’ve never had to worry about Xuan Xuan and Xue Xue since they were young.”

At this moment, there was a sound from outside the door.

A young woman enter the house. She wore a smart suit and her long curly hair was draped over her shoulders. Her facial features were not too stunning, but they were very well-groomed. She wore a confident expression on her face.

This was the eldest daughter that Ye Shuang was so proud of, Lin Xuan.

Lin Xuan was 25 years old this year, and she was an excellent lawyer.

“Oh my! Our Xuan Xuan is back. How was work? It must’ve been very tiring, right? Our Xuan Xuan has lost weight.” Seeing Lin Xuan, Ye Dafu and Yao Cuifen immediately got up to welcome her. Their faces were full of benevolent smiles.

Yao Cuifen, in particular, held Lin Xuan’s hand and fussed over her granddaughter endlessly.

She looked like a good grandmother who doted on the younger generation. She was acting like a completely different person from the time Ye Zhuo was first introduced to her.

There was not the slightest smile on Lin Xuan’s face. There was even a hint of impatience on her face. She did not have a good impression of her mother and her relatives from her mother’s side of the family. Even her grandparents were no exception.

This kind of hypocritical poor relatives only took a fancy to their family’s money.

If she was not ‘Lin Xuan’ and she was only the daughter of a poor family, would they still dote on her like this?

Lin Xuan greeted her grandfather and grandmother without much passion.

“Xuan Xuan, come here. This is your fourth aunt’s biological daughter, Ye Zhuo.”After saying that, Ye Shuang continued, “Ye Zhuo, this is your cousin, Lin Xuan. Your cousin is currently working in a law firm. If you encounter any difficulties in your studies, you can ask her for advice.”

“Eldest cousin.” Ye Zao’s tone was light.

Lin Xuan turned her head to look at Ye Zhuo. Her originally impatient eyes suddenly revealed a stunning light.

Ye Shu’s biological daughter was extremely beautiful.

Looking at her face, one would immediately associate it with the phrase ‘devastatingly beautiful’.

But what was the use of being beautiful?

Ye Shu was also beautiful, but in the end, she still became a mistress and gave birth to an illegitimate daughter!

Lin Xuan did not take Ye Zhuo seriously. What kind of future could a person like Ye Zhuo have? At most, she would be like her mother. With her beautiful face, she could become a mistress and give birth to an illegitimate daughter in the future.

Lin Xuan was full of righteousness. She really did not want to get involved with this group of people. If it was not her mother’s birthday today, she would never have come back!

She nodded casually at Ye Zhuo and then turned to look at Ye Shuang. “Mom, I’m a little tired. I’ll go back to my room to rest.”
