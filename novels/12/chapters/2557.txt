“I’m a doctor.”Ye Zhuo patted Wei Wei’s hand.

“Wei Wei’s eyes were very red, but she still held back her tears. ”

She couldn’t cry.

“Wei Wei continued, “Sister Ye, when can I be discharged?” ”

“Hearing this, Liu Meilian immediately walked over and asked, “Yes, yes, yes. Miss Ye, when can my daughter be discharged?” ”

She could not wait to bring Wei Wei to her house.

“Ye Zhuo looked at Liu Meilian and continued, “She will need to recover for at least a month.” ”

A month?

“A month’s time was enough for too many things to happen. She could not wait for a month. Liu Meilian continued, “Miss Ye, can you be discharged from the hospital early and go home to recuperate?” ”

She had to get ahead of Xiang Chao and bring Wei Wei back. She had to let Xiang Chao intercept her.

“”No,”ye Zhuo said. ”

Liu Meilian frowned slightly. “Then do we have to stay for a month?”

“Ye Zhuo did not say anything. Doctor Zhao, who was at the side, continued, “It depends on how she recovers. If we forcefully discharge Wei Wei from the hospital now, her life will definitely be in danger.” ”

“When she heard that her life was in danger, Liu Meilian was terrified. She immediately said, “Then we won’t be discharged. We won’t be discharged!” ”

“Ye Zhuo looked at Wei Wei and continued, “Wei Wei, if you feel any discomfort, tell the nurse immediately. I’ll be leaving First!” ”

“Okay.”Wei Wei nodded.

Ye Zhuo explained some problems to doctor Zhao before he left.

“She left through the back door of the hospital, perfectly avoiding the reporters who were waiting at the front door. ”

Wang Dajun returned home in a daze.

“When Zhang Hong saw her husband return, she immediately took the briefcase from his hands. “Dajun is back.” ”

“Wang Dajun sat on the chair, his face ashen. “Zhang Hong.” ”

“”Yes, What’s Wrong?”Zhang Hong asked. ”

“Wang Dajun continued, “Let’s get a divorce.” ”

Divorce?

Zhang Hong was stunned.

“When mother Wang, who was standing in the living room, heard this, her tears fell like rain. She covered her mouth, not allowing herself to make a sound. ”

“She had watched the live broadcast, so she naturally knew the result of the surgery. ”

The surgery had failed.

“In the end, Ye Zhuo had appeared in time. ”

Wang Dajun had proposed a divorce at this time so that he would not drag Zhang Hong Down.

“As a mother, it was not appropriate for her to say anything. ”

She respected her son’s choice.

“Why do you want a divorce?”Zhang Hong continued to ask.

“Wang Dajun continued, “The surgery failed.” ”

“You want a divorce because of this?”Zhang Hong asked.

Wang Dajun was stunned.

“Back then, his wife had married him because of the sacred position of a doctor. Now, he could no longer hold a scalpel. He was no longer a chief physician. When he reached middle age, he was facing a crisis of unemployment. ”

Would his wife continue to stay by his side at such a time?

“Isn’t this reason enough?”Doctor Wang asked.

“Zhang Hong frowned, then, she said, “I saw the live broadcast. I know that the surgery failed! “But I never thought of divorcing you, so you’re not allowed to divorce either! “We’ve already spent half our lives together. What do you mean by wanting to get rid of me now! “Do you want Tao Tao to be a motherless child?” ”

“But I can’t be a doctor anymore!”Wang Dajun said.

“”There are so many careers in life, why do we have to be doctors?”Zhang Hong continued, “We can start a business and advance and retreat together. The world is so big, there must be a job that suits us!” ”

“Hearing Zhang Hong’s words, the Queen Mother’s face was full of disbelief. ” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“She never dreamed that this daughter-in-law, who usually looked snobbish, would support her son so much at this time. ”

This made her especially surprised.

“Honghong?”The Queen Mother looked up at Zhang Hong.

“Mom.”Zhang Hong turned her head.

“The Queen Mother said in a low voice, “Honghong, thank you. Thank you for standing behind Wang Dajun resolutely. ”

“”Mom, we’re all family!” ”

“The queen mother wiped her tears and laughed. “Yes, you’re right. We’re all family.” ”

“Zhang Hong turned to look at Wang Dajun and continued, “No matter what happens, a family is a family. You’re not allowed to casually mention the word ‘divorce’in the future!” ”

“Okay.”Wang Dajun nodded.

“Zhang Hong continued, “During this period of time, you should rest at home and adjust your mood. It just so happens that Tao Tao and the others are going on vacation. The five of us can go out for a walk, Relax, and travel!” ”

Wang Dajun’s current situation was also more suitable for him to go out for a walk.

“All these years, the couple had only accumulated some savings ”

“Hearing that.., mother Wang agreed very much, “Right, right, right. Hong Hong is right. We should go out for a walk. “But your father and I won’t go. We haven’t been to any place all these years, so we can’t be bothered to do anything. Besides, since both of you have left, we can’t go home without anyone.” ”
