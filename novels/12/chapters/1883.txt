Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

The few of them walked towards the main hall together.

The hall was very large.

“The decorations were very characteristic of the famous clans. Carved decorations could be seen everywhere, as well as decorations representing the famous clans of the prairie. ”

The hall was filled with mahogany furniture.

The room was warm like spring.

“Father Li asked the butler to serve the best tea. He raised the cup and looked at Cen Shaoqing. “Fifth Master, my house is simple and crude. I’ve made you and Miss ye suffer.” ”

Li Yueyue looked at her father in shock. She could not close her mouth for a long time.

She never knew that Father Li had such a ‘cultural’side.

“Was this still her father who drank a lot of wine and ate a lot of meat, and kept saying ‘father’, ‘f * ck’, and ‘Scram’? ”

“At this moment, Li Yueyue even thought that she was hallucinating. ”

It was the first time she had seen such a magical scene.

“After all, Father Li was the richest man on the prairie. No matter who saw him in the entire prairie, they had to be polite and courteous. However, father Li acted like a helpless primary school student in front of Cen Shaoqing. ”

Mother Li seemed to have changed a lot as well.

Li Yueyue used to think that CEN fifth master was just a form of address.

Only now did she completely understand the horror of CEN fifth master.

“After accompanying Cen Shaoqing to have some tea in the main hall, father Li brought Cen Shaoqing to the backyard. ”

It snowed almost every day in winter on the prairie.

“Although the backyard was cleaned, the yard was still a vast expanse of white. ”

“A red plum tree was blooming in the wind, adding some color to the small yard. ”

Cen Shaoqing observed the environment of the small courtyard without batting an eyelid.

He thought that ye Zhuo would definitely like this place very much.

“Father Li continued, “Fifth master, this is the place for you and Miss Ye to stay. This side is your room, and this side is Miss Ye’s room. If you have any needs, just tell us or the housekeeper directly.” ”

“Father Li was very nervous now, afraid that he might neglect CEN Shaoqing. ”

Father Li had never been so nervous.

This was a real master!

“If he offended Cen Shaoqing, then his good days would come to an end. ”

“Therefore, when he learned that ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing were going to stay at home for a few days, father Li was worried and afraid. Ever since he heard the news, he had not slept well at night. ”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Then you should rest first. I Won’t disturb you anymore.”Father Li returned to the main hall.

“Seeing father Li return, mother li asked, “Has fifth master Cen been arranged?” ”

“Everything has been arranged.”Father Li nodded.

“After saying that, father Li looked in the direction of the backyard and said with a sigh, “I didn’t expect fifth master Cen to be so young! From the looks of it, he’s at most twenty-five or twenty-six years old!” ”

“”That can’t be right.”Mother li frowned and continued, “I heard from Yueyue that fifth master Cen is about eleven or twelve years older than Miss Ye. He shouldn’t be only twenty-five or twenty-six this year, right?” ”

“Mother Li was a meticulous person. Although Li Yueyue had said it once, she still remembered it. ”

“Father Li wiped the cold sweat on his forehead. “I really didn’t see it. I thought he was only twenty-five or twenty-six years old! However, even if he’s eleven or twelve years older than Miss Ye, it’s not simple!” ”

The Cen family had only flourished in Cen Shaoqing’s hands.

“Before this, the CEN family was just a very ordinary wealthy family. ”

“Mother Li looked at father Li, who was constantly wiping his sweat. “The weather isn’t hot. Why are you sweating all over? Did you steal something?” ”

“Father Li said, “You scared me! Although CEN fifth master didn’t say anything, I just panicked.”Father Li couldn’t describe the feeling he had. He only knew that he was very afraid. ”

“In front of Cen Shaoqing, he had to think for a long time about every word he said. ”

He was afraid that he had said something wrong.

“This was clearly the Li family’s villa, but father Li felt that when he arrived at the Cen family’s manor, he had become the one living under someone else’s roof. ”

“If it were any other time, mother Li would have mercilessly mocked father Li, saying that Father Li had grown so big, but she didn’t do it today because she saw that Cen Shaoqing was also a little petrified. ”

She did not even dare to look CEN Shaoqing in the eye.

“Cen Shaoqing clearly had a smile on his face, but it always made people feel pressured. ”

“Mother Li continued, “Miss Ye is really too amazing!” ”

“Putting aside ye Zhuo’s ability, just the fact that she could control CEN Shaoqing was already very amazing! ”

“If it were anyone else, it would really be difficult for them. ” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Father Li said, “If she’s not amazing, can she build an aircraft carrier? Our Yueyue is also very lucky to be able to be classmates with Miss Ye!”To be able to become classmates and good friends with Ye Zhuo was simply three lifetimes of luck. ”
