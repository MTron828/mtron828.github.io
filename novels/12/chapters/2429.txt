“She looked a little scary, as if she would strangle Bai Mo in the next second. ”

“Bai Mo had been beaten up quite a lot these past few days. When she saw Liu Chao like this, she was so scared that her face turned pale. ”

“”No, no, you misunderstood,”Bai Mo immediately explained. “Liu Chao, I didn’t mean that. I just heard that childbirth is very painful, so I’m a little afraid...” ”

“Liu Chao said, “Which woman doesn’t give birth? Bai Mo, do you think you’re still in the S Galaxy? You’re no longer the second miss of the Bai Family!” ”

“Bai Mo lowered her eyes, the expression in her eyes was very complicated. ”

“She was originally a phoenix in the sky, but in the end, she had actually fallen to such a state. ”

How ridiculous.

“After a moment, Bai Mo finally reacted. “Alright, I’ll go over with you after eating.” ”

Only then was Liu Chao satisfied.

“After dinner, Bai Mo followed Liu Chao to the hospital. ”

“No matter what time it was, there were many people in the hospital. ”

“Liu Chao knew a doctor in the hospital, so he did not need to queue up. He just needed to go for a checkup. ”

Bai Mo and Liu Chao went for a checkup.

“After taking the report, Liu Chao brought Bai Mo to the Doctor’s office. ”

“The Doctor was a young woman in her thirties. She looked at Liu Chao and said, “Is this your wife?” ”

“Yes.”Liu Chao nodded.

“The doctor smiled and said, “She’s very lucky in love.” ”

“However, from the looks of it, Bai Mo was definitely a beauty. ”

She was more than enough to match up to an ordinary person like Liu Chao.

Liu Chao’s vanity exploded at this moment. “It’s alright. Quickly show us what’s going on.”

“Where’s the report?”The doctor reached out his hand to Liu Chao.

Liu Chao immediately handed the report to the Doctor.

“The Doctor took the report. The next second, he smiled at Liu Chao. “Do you still need to do a check-up?” ”

Liu Chao was stunned. “What do you mean?”

“The doctor continued, “Your wife is pregnant.” ”

Pregnant!

“Liu Chao’s face was filled with disbelief. He turned to look at the doctor and asked, “You mean that she’s pregnant?” ”

“”Yes.”The doctor nodded. “From the examination results, it’s been a month.” ”

A month?

She’s been pregnant for a month?

Bai Mo’s face instantly turned pale.

What was going on?

When did she get pregnant?

How could she be pregnant with a lowly person like Liu Chao?

No.

She couldn’t. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

She couldn’t get pregnant!

“At this point, the Doctor raised his head to look at Bai mo. “Have you had any special reactions recently?” ”

Bai Mo’s heart was filled with humiliation. How could she still hear the doctor’s words clearly.

“Seeing Bai Mo like this, the doctor smiled and looked at Liu Chao. “Look, your wife is so happy that she’s going crazy.” ”

Liu Chao knew that Bai Mo was not happy at all. It was because she could not accept it. He reached out and pushed Bai mo. “The Doctor is asking you a question!”

Only then did Bai Mo react. “AH? What?”

“The doctor smiled and repeated what he had just said. “I said, did you have any special reactions during this period of time, such as dizziness or Nausea?” ”

“No.”Bai Mo shook her head.

“The doctor continued, “Everyone’s pregnancy reaction is different. During the first three months, you must pay attention to rest and not do heavy work. Liu Chao, you must pay more attention. Your wife is thin to begin with. Take advantage of the pregnancy to nourish her!” ”

Bai Mo could not describe the feeling in her heart.

“She only had one thought now, and that was to kill Liu Chao! ”

“On the way back from the hospital, Bai Mo was absent-minded. ”

“Liu Chao originally wanted to teach Bai Mo a good lesson, but seeing that Bai Mo was already pregnant, he did not make a move, he said, “Bai Mo, you already have my flesh and blood now. Just Live Well with me. Don’t think about all that nonsense anymore! No matter how much you think about it, it will only be a futile effort.” ”

Bai Mo nodded. “Okay.”

“Although she nodded, she did not want to compromise with fate. ”

She had to think of a way to go back.

“She absolutely could not become a lowly earthling, much less give birth to a child for Liu Chao. ”

She could not!

“Bai Mo held onto the car seat tightly. Because she had used too much strength, her knuckles were already slightly white. ”

“Liu Chao was supposed to go out in the afternoon, but because Bai Mo was pregnant, he did not go out in the afternoon. He stayed at home to accompany Bai Mo.. ”

“In the evening, he personally cooked a lot of food that was suitable for pregnant women. ”

Bai Mo ate everything like wax.

She just wanted to go back.

Back to where she belonged.

Liu Chao scooped a bowl of soup for Bai mo. “I have to make a long trip tomorrow. You take good care of yourself at home.”

Liu Chao was not at home tomorrow?

“Bai Mo narrowed her eyes and continued, “When will you be back?” ”
