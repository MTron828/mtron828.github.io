“Mu Yourong’s eyes were slightly red. She said in a very aggrieved manner, “It is said that poverty can not defeat wealth, and wealth can not defeat officials. Big Brother Li, forget it. Since fifth master said that I am not a driver, then I am not!” ”

Mu Yourong’s words had a particularly profound meaning.

She was hinting that Cen Shaoqing was using his power to oppress people.

He had taken away the glory that should have belonged to her.

He ziteng was stunned. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

He did not know who to believe.

“Special Assistant Zhou turned to look at Mu Yourong. “Miss MU, fifth master had already expected that you would say this. He specially prepared the coach car for you. If the driver is you, you can just show us your driving skills on the spot.” ”

“After saying this, Special Assistant Zhou placed the car keys on the table. ”

“He ziteng said, “That’s right, Miss Mu, can you show us your driving skills?” ”

Mu Yourong was silent for a moment.

Tears immediately welled up in her eyes.

“Seeing this, he ziteng frowned. ”

“Crying at every turn, what was going on? ”

“Li Qiandong’s heart ached terribly, and he continued, “Special Assistant Zhou, aren’t you deliberately making things difficult for us? ! Yourong’s family just suffered a very big accident, so she’s not in the mood to drive at all!” ”

“Special Assistant Zhou calmly replied, “What conflict does being in a bad mood have with driving? The real reason is that miss mu doesn’t know anything about racing, so she doesn’t dare.” ”

“After saying this, Special Assistant Zhou looked at he ziteng. “Young master he, Master Wu said that you’re a professional racer. Whether this video is real or not, you should be able to tell at a glance!” ”

He ziteng was a smart person.

“Things had already developed to this point. If he still could not tell the truth from the lies, then he would be an idiot. ”

Mu Yourong just did not know how to race.

“Because she did not, she did not dare to. ”

“Just as Special Assistant Zhou had said, what conflict did a bad mood have with driving? ”

It was not like she was missing an arm or a leg!

“If Mu Yourong really was a driver, she probably would not have been able to stand special assistant Zhou’s doubts and would have gone to demonstrate her driving skills to prove her innocence! ”

But Mu Yourong did not.

She was feeling guilty!

“He ziteng raised his head to look at Special Assistant Zhou. “Special Assistant Zhou, now I believe that the person in the video is my idol! Can you bring me to meet my idol now?” ”

When he said this.

Mu Yourong was so angry that she wanted to tear ye Zao apart.

Ye Zao!

It was ye Zao Again!

“It did not count that ye Zao had stolen her identity when she was young, but when she grew up, ye Zao had come to snatch things from her again! ”

Shameless!

Special Assistant Zhou nodded. “This will depend on fifth master’s arrangements. Please follow me to fifth master first.”

“Okay.”He ziteng immediately followed Special Assistant Zhou’s footsteps.

“Ziteng! You’ve really been deceived by fifth brother!”Li Qiandong grabbed he ziteng’s wrist.

He ziteng couldn’t leave!

“If he left, what would happen to Mu Yourong? ”

What about the Mu Corporation?

He had to keep he ziteng!

Only he ziteng could save the Mu Corporation now.

“He ziteng turned to look at Li Qiandong, he said in a low voice, “Qiandong, tell me the truth. This woman is your old lover, right? “I heard that your father suspended your bank card and even removed your position. Now That You’re all alone, you can’t Help Your Old Lover, so you lied to me with her. You want me to help her, right?” ”

“The more he ziteng thought about it, the more he felt that something was wrong. ”

Li Qiandong was definitely lying to him!

Because Li Qiandong had been leading the conversation to the Mu Corporation.

Both the words and the words were saying that the MU Corporation had gone bankrupt.

Li Qiandong was clearly trying to get him to lend a hand and make him a sucker.

“”No! I’m not lying to you!”Seeing that he ziteng had a misunderstanding of him, Li Qiandong was so anxious that his face turned white. He immediately explained, “Ziteng, you have to believe me. The person driving the car is really yourong!” ”

“You really didn’t lie to me?”He ziteng narrowed his eyes.

“”It’s true!”Li Qiandong said with certainty, “Ziteng, we’ve known each other for so many years. When do you think I’ve ever lied to You?” ”

“Although Li Qiandong was a bit of a playboy and was more playful, he really had never lied to anyone. ”

“He ziteng glanced at Li Qiandong, “Then Mu Yourong is lying to you! Qiandong, you’re not young anymore! How can you keep indulging in her tenderness? You Can’t even walk when you see a woman! You see, she’s so guilty that she doesn’t even dare to touch a car, so how can she race? Wake Up, brother! Don’t be fooled by her!” ”

“Actually, what he ziteng said made a lot of sense. ”

“But at this moment, Li Qiandong simply couldn’t listen to him. ”

“Li Qiandong held he ziteng’s hand. “No! Ziteng, you’ve really misunderstood yourong. She didn’t lie to you either! Fifth Brother is lying to you!” ”

Mu Yourong was so kind. How could she lie?
