Zhou Ziyue was not the same person as usual.

Her tone was arrogant and her attitude was overbearing.

“Ye Sui looked at Zhou Ziyue and said, “Ziyue, do you have any ideas?” ”

“”Don’t ask,”Zhou Ziyue said. ”

“Ye Sui frowned slightly. “Ziyue, if you think of any good ideas, you must tell Mom.” ”

“Just follow my instructions.”

“She couldn’t say too much to ye Sui. If she said too much, she would definitely ruin things. ”

Zhou Ziyue didn’t want to take too big a risk.

“Ye Sui was very curious and continued, “Ziyue, what exactly are you thinking?” ”

“”Don’t ask too much.”Zhou Ziyue put the clothes into the suitcase and continued, “Go and find ye Shu quickly. I’ll pack the rest.” ”

“Are we really going to move out overnight?”Ye Sui was very uncertain.

What if they moved out and they couldn’t move back?

“”Mom, let me ask you. Do you want to be like Ye Shu and become a rich lady?”Zhou Ziyue looked at ye Sui and asked seriously. ”

“Yes.”Ye Sui nodded.

Even in her dreams.

God knows how much she envied ye Shu.

“”Since you want to,”Zhou ziyue narrowed her eyes, “Then listen to me. As long as you listen to me, I promise you can live the same life as ye Shu.” ”

“”Really?”Ye Sui frowned slightly, unable to believe what Zhou Ziyue said. ”

“Of course it’s true.”Zhou Ziyue’s eyes were full of confidence.

“After saying that, Zhou ziyue continued, “Alright, go and find ye Shu quickly. Tell her what I said, and then come back quickly.” ”

“Ye Sui hesitated for a moment, then nodded. “Okay.” ”

Ye Sui walked to the front yard.

“Soon, he arrived at Ye Shu’s yard. ”

Ye Shu was watering the plants in the yard with a small kettle.

“Little Shu.”

“”SIS, why are you here now?”Ye Shu asked in surprise when she saw ye Sui. ”

Ye Sui walked over with a smile. “I came to say goodbye to you and chat with you.”

“Say Goodbye?”Ye Shu was stunned.

“Yes.”

“Ye Shu continued, “It’s already so late, do you still want to leave?” ”

This was not ye Sui’s style.

“”Yes.”Ye Sui nodded. He felt that Zhou Ziyue was not just saying that. He continued, “Our Ziyue is already packing her things.” ”

“”Then I’ll get the driver to send you guys off,”ye Shu said. ”

“”No need, no need.”Ye Sui directly refused. “We’ll take a taxi to go by ourselves, Little Shu. I came to look for you to confirm something.” ”

“What is it?”Ye Shu asked.

Ye Sui looked at Ye Shu. “Then I’ll be straightforward. Are you going to buy our villa or not?”It was just buying a villa. Ye Shu was really stingy. She could buy a villa until now!

They were sisters!

“Ye Shu smiled at ye Sui. “I don’t think I have the obligation to buy a villa for you, right?” ”

“”You mean you don’t want to buy it, right?”Ye Sui continued, “It’s fine if you don’t want to buy it. Just don’t regret it when the time comes.” ”

Ye Shu frowned slightly. She didn’t understand what ye Sui meant.

“Ye Sui looked at ye Shu proudly and continued, “Think about it yourself. Oh right, I sent my bank account number to your wechat.” ”

“What do you mean?”Ye Shu asked.

Ye Sui stretched out five fingers. “Transfer the money over. This number starts with nine digits.”

Ye Shu frowned slightly.

“”Little Shu, I’ve told you everything I need to say. Think about it yourself.”After saying that, ye Sui turned around and walked out of the door. ”

“Ye Shu looked at ye Sui’s back, her eyes full of confusion. ”

What exactly was the reason that made ye Sui become like this?

She was a little curious.

“But she was only curious for a moment, so ye Shu continued to water the flowers. ”

On the other side.

“When ye Sui returned to the room, Zhou Ziyue had already packed everything. ”

“Ye Sui looked at Zhou Ziyue and continued, “Ziyue, are we really leaving?” ”

“Yes.”Zhou Ziyue nodded. “Have you told ye Shu Everything?”

“”Yes, I have.”Ye Sui continued, “But she doesn’t seem to have any intention of compromising.” ”

“”This isn’t something that she can not compromise just because she doesn’t want to compromise.”Zhou Ziyue narrowed her eyes and continued, “Mom, check if there’s anything else that you have forgotten. Let’s go.” ”

“”Okay.”Ye Sui nodded. He hesitated for a moment before continuing, “Then, are we really leaving?” ”

“Yes.”Zhou Ziyue pulled up the suitcase.

“Ye Sui was a little hesitant. “Really, really leaving?” ”

“Am I still joking with You?”Zhou Ziyue asked back.

“Ye Sui bit his lips. “Ziyue, tell me honestly, how confident are you?” ”

“”About 90% ,”Zhou Ziyue said. ”

“Really?”Ye Sui asked.

“Yes.”Zhou Ziyue nodded.

“Ye Sui said again, “Ziyue, what do you know? Tell me!” ”

“I’ll say it again.”Zhou Ziyue was getting impatient. “Just listen to my instructions.”

“Let’s Go!”Ye Sui picked up the suitcase next to him. “I’ll take a gamble today!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Ye Sui followed Zhou Ziyue’s footsteps and walked to the door without looking back.

Zhou Ziyue had arranged for an online car booking in advance.

“Ye Sui got into the car and asked, “Where are we going now?” ”

“”To the hotel,”Zhou Ziyue answered. ”

“Ye Sui frowned slightly and asked, “Then we’ll stay in the hotel next?” ”

“Yes.”Zhou Ziyue nodded.

“Then until when?”Ye Sui asked.

“Zhou ziyue said, “Until ye Shu invites us back.” ”

Ye Sui narrowed his eyes. “Can ye Shu really come and pick us up personally?”

“She will.”

“Seeing Zhou Ziyue’s determined look, ye Sui slowly calmed down. ”

Zhou Ziyue had never been an unreliable person. She must have her own reasons for being so sure.

“About half an hour later, the car stopped at the entrance of the hotel. ”

The mother and daughter officially moved from the Lin family to the hotel.

“When they arrived at the hotel, Zhou Ziyue continued, “Mom, did you call Grandma?” ”

“Why did you call your grandma?”Ye Sui asked.

“Zhou ziyue continued, “I called Grandma and asked her and Grandpa to bring the letter of divorce with Ye Shu to Beijing.” ”

Ye Sui frowned. “Why did you ask them to come?”

Zhou Ziyue was getting impatient. “Can you not ask so many questions? Just do as I say!”

Ye Sui was stunned by Zhou Ziyue’s words.

“What are you waiting for? ! Hurry up and call Grandma and Grandpa!”

“Ye Sui immediately took out his cell phone. Just as he was about to make a call, he seemed to have thought of something and said, “Then what should I tell your Grandma and Grandpa?” ”

“Just do as I say.”Zhou Ziyue’s face was a little ugly. “Why do you always talk so much nonsense! Is this very interesting?”

“For some reason, ye Sui suddenly felt a little afraid of Zhou Ziyue who was like this. He swallowed his throat and said, “Okay, okay, okay. I’ll listen to you. I’ll contact your grandmother and the others right away.” ”

“After that, ye Sui dialed the number of his hometown. ”

“After hanging up the phone, ye Sui looked at Zhou Ziyue and said, “Your grandparents said that they will come tomorrow.” ”

“”Okay.”Zhou Ziyue narrowed her eyes and said, “Send a message to ye Shu. Tell her that you’ll wait for three days. If she still turns hostile after three days, then don’t blame us for being rude!” ”

“Send a wechat message?”Ye Sui asked.

“Okay.”

Yun Jing.

Yao Cuifen and ye Dafu boarded the plane to the capital.

“It was Yao Cuifen’s first time on a plane, so she was very excited. She looked at ye Dafu and said, “Do you think Xiao Sui has sent a message?” ”

Ye Dafu hugged a teacup and narrowed his eyes. “It must be Xiao Shu who asked us to go over.”

“Xiao Shu?”Yao Cuifen asked.

“”Yeah.”Ye Dafu continued, “I heard that Shu is Amazing Now! Lin Qingcheng is a famous tycoon in the capital. She is now a rich lady from a rich family!” ”

“Really?”Yao Cuifen’s eyes lit up instantly.

“”Speaking of which, we have three daughters. Little Sui is the most filial!”Ye dafu sighed and said, “Shu has been a rich lady outside for so many years. She thought of us. Little Sui has only been there for a few days!”! She already wants to take us over to enjoy her life!” ”

“Although Yao Cuifen had experienced many things over the years, there was a saying that said that a leopard can’t change its spots, “That B * Tch has always been a b * Tch since she was young. I never thought that she could raise me! We worked so hard to raise her up, and yet she wants to cut off relations with us! Is there such a daughter in the world?” ”

“In Yao Cuifen’s mind, no matter what happened, Ye Shu was raised by her, and that was her daughter! ”

“Even if they signed the termination letter, their bones and tendons were still broken! ”

“The reason why they did not look for ye Shu all these years was because they did not know where Ye Shu was. Now that they knew that Ye Shu was in the capital and that she had become a rich lady, they naturally could not miss such a good thing! ”

Who asked ye Shu to be their daughter?
