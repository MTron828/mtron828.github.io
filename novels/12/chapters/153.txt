Chapter 154: 085: The Smart Lin Ze, the great burning! 6

After a while, the three of them let go of each other.

Ye Zao looked at Zhao Pingting and said, “Pingting, you’ve lost a lot of weight. You’re so beautiful that I can’t even recognize you!”

Zhao Pingting felt a little embarrassed after being praised.

“Is it that exaggerated?”

“You’re really beautiful,”ye Zao continued, “If you don’t believe me, you can ask Lizi.”

An lizi teased, “Zao Zao, let me tell you, a handsome guy just came to ask Pingting for her wechat account!”

“Really?”

“Really, really!”An Lizi hurriedly nodded.

Zhao pingting became even more embarrassed. “Stop talking, quickly go in.”

“Look at Pingting, she’s embarrassed!”

The few of them chatted and laughed as they walked into the school.

At this moment, Zhao Pingting said, “The school’s honor roll has been posted. Let’s take a look!”

The results of the final exam would be posted on the honor roll on the school’s bulletin board.

......

In the past, no one from their ordinary class had ever been on the honor roll.

This time, the ordinary class had gotten an A grade. The people from the rocket class would definitely be shocked.

“Who’s in first place this time?”An Lizi asked curiously. “Is it still brother Lei?”

Brother Lei’s full name was Han Lei.

Because he was always the first in the entire school, everyone called him brother Lei.

Zhao Pingting said with a proud expression, “Do you even need to ask? Of course it’s our searing flames!”

An Lizi was stunned for a moment, thinking that she had misheard.

In the past, when she and Ye Zao were deskmates, Ye Zao was still an underachiever, the type who slept in class every day.

Zhao pingting continued, “This time, Zao’s total score is 743 points. He should be able to get first place, right?”

“How... how many points did zao get?”An Lizi was stunned.

“743,”Zhao Pingting repeated.

“D * MN!”An Lizi turned to look at ye Zao. “Big Zao, you’re Too Amazing!”

Ye Zao said humbly, “Just so-so.”

They went to the bulletin board.

There were already quite a few students watching.

In the past, the first place had always been taken by Han Lei.

This time, it was suddenly ye Zao, and everyone was discussing animatedly.

“Ye Zao is also unbelievable! She actually got 749 points!”

“I heard that she was previously the last place in the Rocket Class! How did she suddenly become so amazing?”

“Do you guys think that she...”

“F * ck! Searing! You’re really number one!”Although this answer was within expectations, Zhao Pingting was still ecstatic. She looked even happier than if she had won first place.

Hearing this, everyone looked at ye searing.

“F * ck! She’s so beautiful!”

“Why do I feel that she’s a little familiar?”

Ye searing accepted everyone’s sizing up of him.

There was not the slightest ripple on his handsome face. He was extremely calm and stood out like a crane among a flock of chickens among this group of slightly immature students.

“Zao Zao, in order to celebrate your first place in the exam, you invite Lizi and I to go skewer tonight!”

Ye Zao nodded. “Sure.”

An Lizi continued, “Let’s go to the Ye family’s private restaurant that has been very popular recently?”

Zhao Pingting hurriedly nodded, “Sure, sure!”! “I heard that the food at their restaurant is really delicious. They’re going to open their fourth branch in the east of the city soon. However, today is the first day after the new year, so there will definitely be a lot of people eating there. Why don’t we wait until there are fewer people before we go?”

“It’s fine,”ye Zao smiled and continued, “My mother is the one who opened the Ye’s private restaurant. When the time comes, we can just ask her to use the back door for us.”

“Really?”

Ye Zao nodded.

An Lizi immediately hugged ye Zao’s arm and said, “Zao Zao, I want to eat your family’s limited edition squid braised pork and rabbit head!” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Make the arrangements.”

Zhao pingting said, “Then can I have a limited edition of your family’s Mama Xue Mei?”

“Make the arrangements.”

“Oh Yeah! Zao Zao, you’re the Best!”The two of them hugged ye Zao’s arms, one on each side, as if they were supporting the empress dowager.

In the office.

Qian Dabao held ye searing’s report card, his face full of disbelief.

The first place should be their class’s god of learning, Han Lei.

How did he become ye searing, this scumbag of learning?

If ye searing suddenly became smart, Qian Dabao would definitely not believe it. He had been guiding ye searing for two years, and she was as dumb as a donkey. How could she suddenly become smart?

There must be something fishy going on here!

Qian Dabao narrowed his eyes.

Coincidentally, the form teacher of class seven, Jiang Wenhui, walked in from outside.

People are always in high spirits when it comes to happy events.

Jiang Wenhui was humming a little tune.

“Teacher Jiang, Congratulations. Congratulations to your class’s Ye Zao for winning first place.”

Jiang Wenhui smiled and said, “Teacher Qian, you’re too polite! Actually, your class’s student Han is also very good! He’s only slightly inferior to our class’s student Ye.”
