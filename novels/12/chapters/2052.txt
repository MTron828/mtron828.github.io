“The six clan leaders were usually cautious and conscientious, wholeheartedly thinking of the Chang Yue country. Most importantly, after learning of Ye Zao’s accident, the six clan leaders fainted because of it. How could he possibly betray ye Zao? ”

“The five clan leaders raised their heads and looked at the stage, frowning slightly. ”

“If things were really as Li Ziyue had said, then the wisdom of the eight great clans would all be ruined by the six clan leaders. ”

“Didn’t the Great Witch Doctor Die Long Ago?”

“”I didn’t expect that the sixth patriarch, who usually looks like a dog, would actually be such a person in the hinterland!” ”

“”If the sixth patriarch really betrayed Miss Ye, then the Great Patriarch wouldn’t be able to get away with it either!” ”

Everyone immediately pointed their spears at the sixth patriarch.

“The sixth patriarch wasn’t someone to be trifled with. Seeing that the imposter beside Li Zi Yue didn’t dare to take off his hat, his courage also grew, then, they said, “Li Zi Yue, all of this is your conspiracy, right? ! You’re here to Bewitch People’s hearts, but are all of the people here fools? “Miss Ye is a benefactor to our eight great clans. If it weren’t for Miss Ye, there wouldn’t be our eight great clans. Without the eight great clans, there wouldn’t be the current me! “Why should I be grateful to miss ye? Why should I betray her?” ”

“”That’s a good question.”Li Zi Yue nodded. He turned his head slightly and continued, “Guang Xing, come in.” ”

Guang Xing!

The sixth clan leader’s pupils dilated.

Why was Guang Xing Here!

“In the next second, Guang Xing walked in from outside. ”

“Looking at Guang Xing who seemed to have changed into a different person, the sixth clan leader almost didn’t dare to recognize him. ”

“Li Zi Yue continued, “Guang Xing, Tell everyone why your father betrayed Miss Ye.” ”

“”He’s not my father!”Guangxing’s gaze was very cold, “Why would my father do something like killing my mother! ?”! Five years ago, because I witnessed Guang Youdao killing my mother, I became mentally deranged and delirious. Guang Youdao was afraid that others would find out that the Guang family had a mentally deranged son, so he locked me in the basement. This lock lasted for five years! During these five years, he announced to the public that I had joined the army... ... .. ”

“When these words were said, the people below the stage started discussing. ”

“My God! This sixth clan leader really couldn’t tell!”

“”He’s already like this towards his own son. Now, I don’t doubt that he will betray Miss Ye.” ”

“Guangxing is so pitiful.”

“Xing ‘er...”the sixth clan leader looked at Guangxing and choked on his words. He didn’t know what to say.

“Guang Xing looked at the sixth clan leader, “Don’t shed crocodile tears like this at my side!”! There were two reasons why Guang Youdao would betray Miss Ye. First, he wanted to use Miss Ye’s clothes to cure my mental illness! Second, he wanted to cover the sky with one hand in the Chang Yue Kingdom! Although Guang Youdao looked like he didn’t fight for it on the surface, he was actually secretly dissatisfied with the great clan leader! That was why he wanted to overthrow Miss Ye... “...” ”

“”Xing ‘er! What nonsense are you talking about!”The sixth chief roared angrily, directly interrupting Guang Xing’s unfinished words. ”

“He never expected that one day, his own son would expose his true colors. ”

They were father and Son!

Did Guang Xing still have any humanity!

This unfilial son!

Wasn’t he afraid of being struck by lightning when he did this?

The chief and the others were stunned.

“None of them had expected that their brother, who was with them day and night, would be like this. ”

“If he could lock his own son in the basement, what else could he not do? ”

Could it be...

That the sixth chief was really a traitor?

“”I’m talking nonsense? Are you feeling guilty?”Guangxing looked at the sixth chief, “Good will be rewarded with good and evil will be rewarded with evil. Just like the way, your retribution is coming!” ” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Seeing this scene, Zhao Dan narrowed her eyes. ”

She had originally come to participate in the changyue country’s general election.

She did not expect so many things to happen in succession.

Could it be...

Ye Zhuo really did not die?

“Thinking of this, Zhao Dan raised his head to look at the figure standing there. ”

“The girl was wearing a cap. The brim of the cap was pressed very low, just enough to cover her eyebrows and eyes. ”

Her waist was very straight.

“She was clearly a little girl, but people could see a breathtaking aura that even a man did not have. ”

“Zhao Dan looked at the secretary-general of the General Alliance who was sitting next to her. He leaned slightly and said in a low voice, “Secretary-general, what do you think of this matter?” ”

“The secretary-general looked at the autumn flute and then said, “The autumn flute can indeed ascend to the level of elegance.” ”

“Before he came to Chang Yue, he had supported many rumors about the autumn flute. ”

One of them even said that the autumn flute was the second ye Zao.

“At that time, he was very curious about this autumn flute that he had never seen before. ”

Until he saw the real person.
