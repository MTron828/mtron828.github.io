Chapter 1583: 239: it’s actually her. What does she not know about making things difficult in public? (there’s something else to talk about.)4

She was different from old Mrs. Cen and Bai Shu.

“Bai Zhi did not marry into a rich family. She married an ordinary farmer. Although her children had gone to college and settled abroad, she and her husband still lived in the countryside. ”

“Unlike the spacious asphalt roads in the city, the countryside was two-lane cement roads, and some places were dirt roads. ”

The car was bumpy.

“She thought ye Zao would complain, but he didn’t. Instead, he was very curious. He opened the window and looked outside. “This is my first time on this road. You should have let me drive just now!” ”

“In Ye Zao’s world, because of the development of technology, rural life only existed in history books. ”

“Earth had long been covered by human technology. In some areas, people could only wear gas masks to live. ”

Ye Zao and the people from the laboratory had already begun to study living on Mars.

Cen Shaoqing held the steering wheel with one hand and the Buddha beads with the other. “Why don’t I Park in front and let you drive?”

“”Sure.”Ye Zhuo continued, “But I don’t know the way. Remember to show me the way.” ”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

The car stopped in front and let ye Zhuo Drive.

“Ye Zhuo drove very slowly. It was not because his skills were not good, but because he wanted to enjoy the scenery along the way. ”

The scenery here was really too good!

“If he had not seen it with his own eyes, Ye Zhuo would not have believed that Earth had ever had such a beautiful time. ”

There was a stone bridge in front of him.

“Looking from the side, it had been a few years. There was a treasured sword hanging under the ancient bridge. Ye Zao asked curiously, “Why is there a treasured sword hanging under that Stone Bridge?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing looked sideways and explained, “The ancient people hung a treasured sword under the bridge to prevent the flood dragon from destroying the bridge when it was crossing the water.” ”

“”Oh, I see.”Ye Zhuo continued, “How old is this ancient bridge?” ”

“”It’s said to be 270 years old,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“Ye Zhuo exclaimed, “Our ancestor’s wisdom is too high! The 270-year-old bridge can still be maintained so well!” ”

“CEN Shaoqing said, “China is the hometown of the bridge. Since ancient times, there has been a saying that ‘the country of the bridge’. The construction art of ancient bridges is a creation of the world’s bridges. Our ancestor is indeed amazing!” ”

Ye Zhuo drove the car slowly over the ancient bridge.

“The lake surface rippled with blue skies and white clouds. The two banks of the bridge were lined with trees, making people feel good just by looking at them. ”

“Occasionally, a few small boats would pass by the Lakeside, and there were three or three children fishing by the shore. ”

It was like a poem or a painting.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “When I’m old, I want to find a place like this to live in seclusion.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing smiled. “Okay, I’ll accompany you.” ”

“Ye Zhuo looked forward to that kind of life very much. He continued, “When the time comes, I want to raise a cat and a big dog. Then, I want to plant flowers in front of the door...” ”

“Listening to him, Cen Shaoqing also looked forward to it very much. His thin lips parted slightly. “If you like it, we can live that kind of life now.” ”

“”There’s no need for that now,”ye Zhuo continued, “I still have to contribute to the country!” ”

She wanted to build an aircraft carrier.

She wanted to land on the eight planets.

She wanted to make all the countries that looked down on China be convinced!

“I’ll listen to you.”

“After saying that, CEN Shaoqing continued, “Turn left in front. Little Aunt’s home is just a little further in.” ”

“Okay.”

“The small town was not big, but the geography was very good. Birds chirped and flowers were fragrant, like a paradise. ”

“Soon, the car drove into the town. Ye Zhuo looked at Cen Shaoqing and asked, “Which is little aunt’s house?” ”

“”Five hundred meters further in,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Soon, a small courtyard appeared in his field of vision. ”

“Is it this one?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“”Yes, stop the car,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

Ye Zhuo stepped on the brakes.

The car came to a steady stop and the two of them got out of the car.

Cen Shaoqing went forward and knocked on the door.

“Very soon, a dog’s bark could be heard from the courtyard. ”

“Who is it?”

“The next second, the door opened and a very kind old man came into view. ”

“”Little uncle-in-law,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“Only then did the old man come to his senses. He smiled and said, “So it’s Shaoqing! Shaoqing is here!” ”

“Ye Zhuo also called out, “Little uncle-in-law.” ”

“The old man was stunned. “Shaoqing, is this your girlfriend?” ”

“”Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “This is my girlfriend, Ye Zhuo.” ” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Hearing that Cen Shaoqing finally had a girlfriend, the old man was very happy. “Now your grandmother can finally be at ease!” ”
