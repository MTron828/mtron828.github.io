“Seeing that autumn flute was silent, the great witch doctor continued, “You haven’t found him yet?” ”

“Yes.”Autumn flute nodded.

He hadn’t found him yet...

“The Great Witch Doctor narrowed his eyes and continued, “Did anything strange happen these past few days?” ”

“”Nothing Strange,”autumn flute continued, “However, there is one unexpected thing.” ”

“”Speak,”the Great Witch Doctor said. ”

Autumn flute told him about Joey.

“Joey?”The Great Witch Doctor frowned.

“Ye Lan was raised by Ye Zao. In terms of combat power, autumn flute was not a match for ye Lan. This Joey was actually able to take away those people from the Ye family base from ye Lan. ”

“Autumn flute immediately handed over Joey’s information and said, “Great Witch Doctor, look. This is Joey’s information.” ”

The Great Witch Doctor stretched out his hand to receive it.

This Joey didn’t look simple at all.

“Originally, the Great Witch Doctor didn’t need to care about these people. However, it was going to be the day of the general election soon. No matter what, he couldn’t allow any problems to appear at this critical juncture. ”

“After a moment, he put down the information and said, “Bring Joey to me before ten o’clock tomorrow morning.” ”

“Yes.”Autumn flute nodded.

“After the Great Witch Doctor left, Qiu di immediately called Zhou Qing. ”

“Bring Joey to the Great Witch Doctor.”

“”Yes, miss. .” ”

“In order to find Joey, Zhou Qing opened the tracer and located Joey’s residence. ”

On the other side.

Joey’s residence.

Li Ziyue led a few people and hid around the house.

“”Quick, quick, quick! You guys hide well! Don’t let that traitor Zhou Qing find out!” ”

“Remember what sister Qiao said.”

“”Only success, no failure.” ”

“”Don’t worry, brother Li! We definitely won’t let sister Qiao Down.” ”

“Li Ziyue took out his binoculars and looked at the horizon. Soon, a ray of light appeared in the lens. ”

“Seeing this, Li Ziyue immediately put away his binoculars and turned back to the people behind him. “Quick, quick, quick! Hide well! Zhou Qing is here!” ”

“Hearing this, everyone immediately went into hiding. ”

“Soon, a flying machine stopped on the lawn in front of the door. ”

The door of the flying machine opened.

Zhou Qing and four assistants walked out from inside.

“Once they got off the flying machine, Zhou Qing frowned. She felt that something was not right, but she could not tell what was wrong. ”

“”You two go over there and take a look.”Zhou Qing commanded the four assistants behind her, “You two go over there.” ”

“Yes.”

The four of them split up and entered the building on their left and right.

Zhou Qing followed closely behind.

“Li Zi Yue, who was hiding in a corner, narrowed his eyes and looked at his brothers beside him. ”

“At this moment, silence was better than sound. ”

The two of them understood the meaning behind each other’s eyes.

“Li Zi Yue took out a machine gun and activated silent mode, followed by anti-detection mode. ”

“Currently, there weren’t any high-tech machine guns in the state of changyue. ”

This machine gun was given to Li Ziyue by Joey.

Li Ziyue held onto the machine gun. Joey’s face and her style of doing things appeared in front of his eyes once again.

“Once again, he felt that she was similar to ye Zao. ”

And not just a little bit.

Other than that face.

“Most importantly, such a perverted gun didn’t even exist in the Federation’s General Alliance. Where did Joey come from? ” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Seeing that Zhou Qing was about to disappear in front of him, Li Ziyue did not have time to think too much. He immediately closed one of his eyes and aimed at Zhou Qing’s head. ”

“Three, two, one! ”

Now was the time to pull the trigger.

A transparent laser shot out at the speed of light.

“Zhou Qing’s pupils dilated in an instant. Just as she was about to fall to the ground, one come, two go, who were lying in ambush nearby, immediately rushed over to catch Zhou Qing and dragged her into the aircraft not far away. ”

Li Ziyue also immediately ran over.

“”Brother Li, it’s Done!”The two brothers closed the cabin door of the aircraft and looked at Li Ziyue. ”

Li Ziyue kicked Zhou Qing who was lying on the ground. “Where’s Xiao Qian?”

“I’m here.”Sun Xiao Qian walked out from inside.

“Li Ziyue looked at his watch and continued, “Quickly change your clothes with her. Don’t ruin sister Qiao’s plan.” ”

“Okay.”Sun Xiaolu nodded. She pulled Zhou Qing’s arm and dragged her into the cubicle.

“A few minutes later, Sun Xiaolu came out of the cubicle. At this time, she had changed into Zhou Qing’s clothes. ”

“”F * ck! F * ck!”Yi Lai said in surprise, “Except for your face, Xiaolu, your height and figure are exactly the same as Zhou Qing’s.” ”

“If one looked from the back, it would be Zhou Qing himself. ”

“It seems that sister Qiao has good taste.”Two of them touched his chin and continued.
