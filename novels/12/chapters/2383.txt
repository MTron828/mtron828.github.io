Translator: 549690339

“Bai Mo followed the Shangguan family’s footsteps and did not forget to turn to look at Bai Jingshu. “Sister, I’ll go over first.” ”

“Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded.

“Looking at Bai Mo’s back, a worried look flashed across her eyes. ”

“Ye Zhuo placed his hands on Bai Jingshu’s shoulders. “Sister-in-law, don’t worry.” ”

“With her around, she would not let Bai Mo Ruin Lin Ze and Bai Jingshu’s wedding. ”

“Okay.”

“Seeing that Bai Jingshu was still worried, ye Zhuo walked to Cen Shaoqing’s side. “Send someone to keep an eye on Bai Mo. I have a feeling that she will ruin things.” ”

“The one who just left?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“”Okay, I’ll arrange it right away.”CEN Shaoqing continued, “I’ll make sure that my future brother-in-law’s wedding goes smoothly!” ”

“Go.”

Cen Shaoqing turned around and walked out of the house.

“Bai Mo was Bai Jingshu’s cousin, so Cen Shaoqing naturally knew that Bai Mo was not an ordinary person. ”

“She was not an ordinary person, so she naturally could not use an ordinary person to spy on her. ”

Bai Mo sat in the VIP seat and vaguely felt that something was wrong.

Someone was spying on her.

And there was more than one.

What should she do now?

Should She Stop Now?

Bai Mo was naturally unwilling to let her stop now.

“But if she didn’t Stop Now, what if she was caught? ” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“While she was hesitating, Bai Mo peeled a piece of candy and stuffed it into her mouth. At that moment, she suddenly thought of something and a smug smile appeared on her face. ”

She wanted to make Bai Jingshu lose face unknowingly and be abandoned by Lin Ze in public!

Over here.

“Although there was a small interlude with Bai Mo, the wedding was still going on. ”

Dog Two walked over to an Lizi’s side. “Has sister found a boyfriend yet?”

An Lizi glanced at him. “Who’s your sister?”

“Dog two continued, “Brother Ze and I are good brothers, and we’re older than you. Don’t tell me you still want to be my sister?” ”

An Lizi didn’t say anything.

“Why didn’t your boyfriend come with you?”

“What does it have to do with you?”An Lizi rolled her eyes at him.

“Buttface really deserved a beating. “I think you don’t have a boyfriend at all, right?” ”

“”If you want to ask me if I have a boyfriend, just tell me directly. Why do you have to take such a big turn?”An Lizi said unhappily, “Yes, so what if I don’t have a boyfriend? So what if I’m a single dog? Did I eat your food or drink your water? Aren’t you a single dog?” ”

“Although an Lizi wasn’t old, Xia Xiaoman was already starting to urge her. ”

“According to Xia Xiaoman, those who should be in a relationship should be in a relationship, and those who should be studying should study hard. ”

The best time to be in a relationship in life was when one was 22-26 years old.

It would be even better if they could fall in love in college.

“Buttface smiled and said, “Since it’s such a coincidence that you’re a single dog and I’m also a single dog, why don’t we make a pair?” ”

“Who wants to make a pair with you?”An Lizi thought that buttface was joking.

“After all, this dog had often joked with her. ”

“”I’m not joking with you. I’m serious.”Buttface looked at an Lizi and said very seriously, “Miss an, why don’t we give it a try?” ”

An Lizi was stunned by dog two’s sudden seriousness.

It seemed a little different from the dog two she knew.

Especially when dog two said ‘miss an.’

“You... are serious?”An Lizi asked.

“Dog two continued, “Do I look like I’m Not Serious?” ”

How should I put it.

“There were some things that had been hidden in his heart for a long time, but dog two had never found a chance to tell an Lizi. ”

Attending a wedding could make people feel an impulse.

Especially when they saw Lin Ze and Bai Jingshu loving each other.

Buttface also wanted to enter the hall of marriage with the person in his heart.

An Lizi looked up and down at Buttface but didn’t say anything. The expression on her face was especially complicated.

“Buttface was a little nervous under an Lizi’s gaze, and he swallowed helplessly. ”

“After a while, Buttface mustered up his courage and said, “What do you think? Have you made up your mind?” ”

“An Lizi looked at buttface and said, “Please, there’s a limit to jokes! What if I take it seriously?”An Lizi didn’t think that buttface was sincere, after all, she had provoked buttface many times. Unless buttface was masochistic, otherwise, how could buttface fall in love with her? ”

Absolutely impossible!

“”Of course I didn’t...”just as buttface was about to say something, another bridesmaid interrupted him. ”
