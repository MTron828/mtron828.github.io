“Chapter 1873: 380: Hidden Beauty, Fifth Master Cen”

Translator: 549690339

Old Mrs. Cen was as happy as a child.

“”Ye, come in quickly. I asked the dessert master to make your favorite Lotus Pastry. It just came out of the oven and is at its best.” ”

“Lotus pastry was a traditional delicacy in su city. Knowing that ye Zhuo liked it, old Mrs. Cen specially hired a dessert master from Su City with a high salary. ”

“”It’s great to have Lotus crisps. Grandma Cen, I Love You.”Ye Zao hugged the old lady and followed her into the house. ”

“Looking at the loving grandfather and grandson, Cen Shaoqing felt that he was a little redundant. ”

“Not only were there Lotus crisps on the table in the house, there were also all kinds of desserts that ye zao liked. ”

Cen Shaoqing walked to the side to read the message.

It was from his assistant.

“”Fifth master, there are five gold mines under your name.” ”

Cen Shaoqing replied: “Send me the information of these five gold mines.”

“Soon, the assistant sent the information over. ”

“After reading the message, CEN Shaoqing picked up his phone and made a call. ”

“Soon, the call was answered. ”

Cen Shaoqing walked out while talking.

“When Cen Shaoqing’s grandmother turned around, she saw Cen Shaoqing walking out. She nudged ye Zao with her elbow and said in a low voice, “Zao Zao.” ”

“”What’s wrong, grandmother Cen?”Ye Zao looked back at Cen Shaoqing’s grandmother. ”

“Cen Shaoqing’s grandmother pointed at Cen Shaoqing’s back and said, “Let’s see what he’s doing sneaking around.” ”

“Ye Zao looked over and said, “He’s probably going to answer the phone.” ”

“What phone call is he going to answer behind your back?”Old Mrs. Cen narrowed her eyes.

“”It should be about work,”ye Zhuo said nonchalantly. ”

“”You silly child. Aren’t you afraid that he’ll make you a cuckold?”Old Mrs. Cen had been obsessed with cuckoldry recently. No matter what she saw, she could always associate it with cuckoldry. ”

“Especially when Cen Shaoqing answered the phone and went outside to answer it, she felt that something was wrong. ”

“”How would he dare!”Ye Zhuo picked up a piece of dessert and handed it to old Mrs. Cen. “Grandma Cen, please try this. This tastes especially good!” ”

Old Mrs. Cen looked at Ye Zhuo as if she was looking at a fool.

“Cen Shaoqing had already secretly gone out to answer the phone, but ye Zhuo was still thinking about dessert. ”

What a thoughtless person!

“I’ll go out and take a look.”Old Mrs. Cen stood up and walked out.

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “There’s really no need. You Can Trust Me.” ”

“”I won’t be at ease if I don’t take a look.”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Ye, don’t worry. If that Brat dares to do anything to you, I’ll break his legs and crush his head!” ”

“Although Cen Shaoqing was old Mrs. Cen’s biological grandson,. ”

Old Mrs. Cen did not understand him at all.

It was because CEN Shaoqing was different from other children.

In her impression.

“From the age of three, Cen Shaoqing refused to be embraced by adults. He even refused to let the nanny and family members bathe and dress him. ”

“He was like a young adult, very capable of using his hands. ”

“When he was a little older, Cen Shaoqing spoke less and less. In the end, he could not say a word for three days. ”

“At that time, old Mrs. Cen was still wondering if Cen Shaoqing would be better when he reached puberty. After all, after a boy goes through puberty, his mind will gradually mature and he will meet someone he likes. ”

“Who knew that after puberty, Cen Shaoqing would directly see through the secular world and start to eat vegetarian and pray, even more so than a monk! ”

“Cen Shaoqing had seen through the secular world at the age of 16, but he had never broken the precepts until he met Ye Zhuo. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen quietly walked to the door. Because she was afraid of being discovered by Cen Shaoqing, she held her breath and listened carefully to the sounds. ”

She could only vaguely hear a few words.

Gold Mine... Gold House or something.

Gold House?

Old Mrs. Cen immediately thought of four words.

A gold house with a mistress.

This was incredible!

Cen Shaoqing’s courage had grown. He actually wanted to hide a mistress in a gold house.

She had to tell ye Zao.

Old Mrs. Cen walked angrily into the house.

“It just so happened that Cen Shaoqing had finished his call at this time. Seeing Old Mrs. Cen like this, Cen Shaoqing asked curiously, “Grandma, what happened to you? who made you angry?” ”

“Who else could it be other than you!”Old Mrs. Cen glared at Cen Shaoqing.

“What About Me?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

Old Mrs. Cen snorted coldly. “Stop pretending. I heard everything just now.”

“What did you hear?”Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips opened slightly. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“”A golden house!”If Old Mrs. Cen was tall enough, she would have pinched Cen Shaoqing’s ears by now. Unfortunately, Cen Shaoqing was much taller than her. There was no small stool here, so she could only put her hands on her hips, “You want to build a golden house! Tell me, who is that little vixen outside! She actually asked you to build a golden house! What a big deal, how come I didn’t see you building a Golden House for your grandmother! Wait, you wait, I’ll Go Tell Scorch to dump you immediately! You Dare to cuckold leaf, I think you’re too arrogant!” ”
