Chapter 49: I Know What I’m Doing

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Ye Shu had no one to rely on in the Yunjing Province.

If she really severed all ties with her family, Ye Shu would definitely not be able to continue living in Yunjing in the future.

It was clear as the day, Ye Shu had no choice but to let go of her dignity and admit her mistake!

Ye Dafu, Yao Cuifen, and Ye Shuai walked over. “Right! We’ll sever ties with you! Ye Shu, if you don’t apologize to Mr. Li today, we’ll immediately sever our ties with you!”

Ye Shu raised her head to look at them.

Her heart was filled with sorrow.

Standing in front of her were her parents, brother, and sister...

She had never thought that one day, she would stand on the opposite side of them in such a situation.

They were her blood relatives, but today, they casually threw around the words ‘sever ties’. It seemed that in their hearts, they no longer regarded her as family.

Thinking this, the tears that Ye Shu was holding back burst out.

“You guys want to sever ties, right? “Ye Zhuo looked them straight in the eye. “We can’t ask for anything better! In the future, my mother and I have nothing to do with you people!”

Ye Shu took a deep breath and took a step forward. “Zhuo Zhuo is right! Since you want to sever ties, so be it! Anyway, I’m no longer your daughter, and I’m no longer your sister! In your hearts, I’m just an item that you can give away to others as you please!”

As the saying goes, he who hesitates is lost.

Today, her family gave her away to Li Hongwei. Who knows what else they had planned for her!

After all, if there was a first time, there would be a second time. Since she knew that there would be a second time, she might as well take this opportunity to sever ties with them.

Ye Zhuo looked at Ye Shu in surprise.

Truth be told, Ye Shu’s reaction surprised her.

In her heart, Ye Shu had always been a very soft-hearted person. She did not expect Ye Shu to be so decisive when it came to dealing with big and important issues!

As they gazed at each other’s faces, Ye Shu smiled at her daughter, signaling to her that she was just fine.

Hearing this, Ye Shuang was almost angered to death. She never knew that her fourth sister would be so ungrateful! It seemed to her that Ye Shu would never know that she had made a mistake until she suffered a loss!

“Alright!” Ye Shuang said with a sullen face, “Since you’ve put it like that, I, Ye Shuang, will never acknowledge you as my sister in the future! From now on, we are two separate individual who are unrelated! We won’t interfere in each other’s business! I hope you won’t regret it!”

“Don’t worry!” Ye Shu raised her head firmly. “I will never regret it!”

After saying that, Ye Shu looked at Ye Zhuo and Ye Sen. “Let’s go.”

“Okay.”

“Ye Sen, stop right there!” Yao Cuifen saw that Ye Sen was about to follow them and quickly said, “If you dare to leave with this b*stard today, I won’t have acknowledge you as my son in future!”

Ye Sen turned around to look at Yao Cuifen, and the corners of his mouth curled up into a sneer, “Haven’t you always only had one precious son, Ye Shuai? Do you still remember what you said to me the day I moved out of the old house?

“In your eyes, what’s the difference between me and the stray cats and dogs by the roadside?

“As long as I can remember, I was brought up by my sister. Do you know that my sister even dropped out of school to work and earn money just so she could pay for my studies!”

From a young age, Ye Sen wore Ye Shuai’s hand-me-downs, and he ate Ye Shuai’s leftovers.

When he was very young, he thought that it was because he was not outstanding enough that his parents did not like him. He studied hard and excitedly showed his parents two test papers that he had scored a hundred marks in each.

What did he get in return?

They claimed that he had copied the answers to the test and gave him a good beating.

That day, he was beaten half to death by his father with a belt. He was extremely depressed and even thought of dying. If Ye Shu had not saved him with her life, he would have died long ago!

From then on, he knew that in the eyes of someone who didn’t have you in his or her heart, no matter how outstanding you performed, they would not even bat an eyelid at you.

Thinking of those past events, Ye Sen couldn’t help but cry.

“In the future, I don’t have any parents or brothers. I only have one elder sister! Her name is Ye Shu! I want to have nothing to do with you people!” Ye Sen held Ye Shu’s arm as he said, “Big Sister, let’s go!” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Looking at the backs of the three people leaving, Lin Xue’s lips curled up in delight.

She really hoped that these three shameless relatives would never come back, “The three of you, remember what you said today. If you go back on your words and come to beg us in the future, you will be worse than pigs and dogs!”

Ye Zhuo looked back slightly, her deep eyes were dark, “Prosperity and decline never last. Life has its ups and downs. It is too early to determine who will be the one begging in future! Remember what you said and did today, you guys are worse than pigs and dogs!”

Lin Xue snorted coldly.

This piece of trash really had a big mouth! Did she really think there would come a time that they would go to her and beg for anything? She was nothing but a lowly b*tch who lived in a basement!

Ye Shu made it clear that she wanted to cut ties with them, but Ye Shu and the other Ye family members were not anxious at all because they knew that Ye Shu would definitely regret her actions.

In less than a month, Ye Shu would come back to beg them.

Yao Cuifen looked at Ye Shuang and said, “Xiao Shuang, if that b*stard comes back to beg you later, don’t forgive her so easily! We can only consider forgiving her after Mr. Li forgives her!”

Ye Shuang nodded. “Mom, I know.”

...

Ye Zhuo booked a ride on her phone.

They had just walked out of the villa area when their ride arrived. Ye Sen sat in the front passenger seat, while Ye Shu and Ye Zhuo sat in the back seat.

Ye Zhuo was looking down at her phone, revealing a part of her fair neck. She was nonchalant with a hint of laziness. As the sunlight shone in through the car window, coating her body with a layer of light, she looked docile and harmless. Where did that aggressive look from just now come from?

If she had not seen it with her own eyes, Ye Shu would never believe that the person just now was her daughter. However, no matter how many faces Ye Zhuo had, she was still her daughter.

Ye Shu cast aside those thoughts as she leaned against the car seat and closed her eyes to take a nap.

Severing ties with the Ye family didn’t have any effect on Ye Shu and Ye Sen.

Life had to go on.

...

All the documents were in place and the restaurant was finally renovated. The restaurant was set to open tomorrow.

The name of the restaurant was very simple.

It was called Ye Family’s Private Kitchen.

With the sound of firecrackers, the restaurant officially opened.

Because no one was notified about the restaurant’s opening, there were no other guests in the restaurant. However, Ye Zhuo had preordered some flower baskets online, so it was still a very ceremonious opening.

Perhaps the location of the restaurant was too remote, hence even after it opened, not a single customer came to eat.

Ye Sen went out to deliver some stuff, leaving only Ye Shu and Ye Zhuo in the restaurant.

Seeing that there were no customers, Ye Shu became a little anxious. She turned to look at Ye Zhuo, but her daughter had lowered her head to play on her phone. Not a hint of anxiety could be seen on her daughter’s face.

Ye Shu had been wanting to say something, but she swallowed the words that were on the tip of her tongue.

Suddenly, footsteps came from outside the door.

‘Could it be that a customer?’

Ye Shu’s eyes lit up. She looked up at the door, but when she saw who had come in, the light in her eyes dimmed again. However, she still stood up with a smile. “Big Sister He, you’re here.”

Mrs. He’s full name was He Fengxian. She was the owner of the snack shop on the same street.

When the restaurant was being renovated earlier, He Fengxian had dropped by to advice Ye Zhuo to transfer the lease of the shop to another party. However, Ye Zhuo refused to believe her words and insisted on opening the shop.

This was perfect. Karma had come so quickly.

These two ungrateful women were going to sit in the shop and suffer great loss!

Thinking of this, a gloating look appeared in He Fengxian’s eyes. “Little Sister, what do you think? Am I right? This shop’s location isn’t good, right? The two of you didn’t believe me. Now, you’re going to suffer a great loss!”

An awkward expression appeared on Ye Shu’s face.

If she had known this would happen, she would have listened to He Fengxian’s opinion.

Seeing that Ye Shu didn’t reply, He Dengxian added fuel to the fire and continued to prod on. “Little Sister, you’ve lost quite a bit of money, right?”

Ye Zhuo raised her eyes ever so slightly and smiled as she replied, “Auntie He, it’s not time to eat yet. How can you be so sure that we’ll suffer a loss?”
