“OH.”There was no special expression on Bai Jingshu’s face.

“”Oh?”Young deer asked incredulously, “Aren’t you surprised at all?” ”

“Bai Jingshu asked, “Why should I be surprised?” ”

“”I heard that the big boss is handsome and rich. He’s a domineering CEO in real life! At the critical moment, he’s still single!”At the end of his sentence, young deer’s eyes were almost sparkling. ”

“Like Bai Jingshu, the big boss rarely showed his face, resulting in a lot of rumors about him. ”

“And then?”Bai Jingshu continued to ask.

“Little deer continued, “And then we can dream. What if the Big Boss takes a fancy to us?” ”

Bai Jingshu chuckled. “How can there be so many stories about Cinderella and domineering CEO in Real Life?”

“Young deer said, “Today, you’re a god in the industry, and you’re so beautiful. How can you say that you’re Cinderella? !” ”

“”Thank you for thinking highly of me.”However, in Bai Jingshu’s eyes, she was just an ordinary person. ”

Young deer continued to fantasize. “What if the Big Boss takes a fancy to you and you become the Lady Boss? Won’t you become the Lady Boss in the future?”

“Bai Jingshu picked up the coffee and took a sip. She smiled and said, “Then I wish your dream will come true soon.” ”

“Thank you.”Little Deer picked up the coffee cup and toasted her.

“After saying that, little deer continued, “Do you have a boyfriend today?” ”

“Not yet.”Bai Jingshu shook her head.

“Little Deer said in surprise, “Then you’re actually not interested in the Big Boss!” ”

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “Relationships need to be managed. If you have time to fall in love, you might as well study more about ancient history and write a few more books.” ”

“Right now, she did not have the slightest intention of falling in love. ”

“Firstly, she had not met anyone suitable. Secondly, she felt that she loved history more than her boyfriend. ”

“Little Deer immediately gave Bai Jingshu a thumbs up. “Not bad! Your ideological awareness is really high! It’s really high! No wonder your writing is so good. Sometimes, I even wonder if you came back from those dynasties!” ”

“Bai Jingshu took a sip of coffee. “Actually, it’s good to do more research.” ”

“More importantly, it was love. Because of love, one could devote one’s heart and soul to writing better things. ”

“Little deer continued, “If you don’t have a partner, will your family rush you?” ” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Sometimes.”Bai Jingshu nodded. “All parents in the world have the same heart.”

“After saying that, Bai Jingshu asked, “What About You?” ”

“Little deer nodded, “Of course!”! “It was fine before, especially after I turned 30. My mom has been brainwashing me and I can just marry anyone!”! “But is it that easy to start a family?”? “If I don’t marry someone i like, I’d rather not marry and just stay single!” ”

“Bai Jingshu nodded and agreed with little deer, “You’re right. You Can’t get married just because you’re married. Marriage isn’t a mission. Since You’re married, you have to be responsible for your partner and the families on both sides. Of course, you also have to be responsible for your future children!” ”

Bai Jingshu’s worldview was the same as young deer’s.

“If she didn’t meet someone suitable, she would rather die alone. ”

“Young deer looked at Bai Jingshu and said regretfully, “It’s a pity that you’re not a man today. If you were a man, I would definitely marry you!” ”

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “Really?” ”

“Of course it’s true.”

“As the two of them chatted, Bai Jingshu suddenly received a message. ”

It was from the s galaxy.

Only then did Bai Jingshu remember that her grandfather’s 90th birthday was coming up.

“Bai Jingshu looked at little deer and continued, “Deer, are you in a hurry to get that autograph?” ”

“What’s the matter?”Little Deer asked.

Bai Jingshu nodded. “It’s my grandfather’s birthday. I have to go back to my hometown.”

“Is your hometown far away?”Little Deer asked.

“”It’s very far. I need about three days to get home, and there’s still no signal in the mountains.” ”

“Hearing this, little deer said in surprise, “Three days? is your family living in outer space today?” ”

“”Sort of,”Bai Jingshu said. ”

The S galaxy was indeed outer space for Earth.

Young deer nodded. “When are you going back?”

“”Tonight,”Bai Jingshu replied. ”

“”Okay,”young deer continued, “Then you go back first. If there’s anything, I’ll leave a message for you. Sign It personally and I’ll negotiate with the publishing company.” ”

“”Thank you, young deer. I’ll contact you as soon as I return.” ”

“”Well, don’t worry. Have Fun in your hometown.” ”

“Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded.
