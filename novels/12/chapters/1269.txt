“Chapter 1270: 268: China, Ye Zao! 5”

Translator: 549690339

“Even Mike, who had seen beauties from all over the world, was amazed when he saw ye Zao. ”

This was a pure beauty.

Clean.

Natural.

Mike suddenly understood why there were more than ten hackers encrypting ye Zao’s information.

Because ye Zao was too outstanding.

Those people wanted to protect her.

“She was pretty, but on the surface, she didn’t look as amazing as Father Zhao said. ”

“If ye Zao was amazing, Ye Zao should have noticed when he came in. ”

But not only did ye Zao not notice at all.

“Instead, he had been playing with his phone. ”

This meant that ye Zao was only average.

Maybe ye Zao could cure his poison by accident.

“After a moment, he looked away and changed the medicine bottle that was about to run out on top of Ye Sen’s head. ”

“After changing the medicine bottle, Mike pushed the trolley and walked out. ”

Ye Zao looked at his phone as he walked out.

Bang.

“Because he wasn’t paying attention to the road, ye Zao accidentally bumped into Mike. ”

His phone fell to the ground as a result.

“Father Zhao already had a guilty conscience. When he saw this scene, he was so scared that his face turned pale. ”

What should he do?

What if ye Zhuo discovered something?

Mike quickly picked up the phone and returned it to Ye Zhuo. “I’m sorry.”

“I’m the one who bumped into you. I should be the one apologizing.”Ye Zhuo took the phone.

Mike smiled and continued to walk out.

“When he saw that ye Zhuo did not take any further action, father Zhao heaved a sigh of relief. ” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

It was alright.

It was alright.

Ye Zao did not notice anything.

Mike pushed the trolley and disappeared into the corridor of the hospital.

“Father Zhao continued to look at Ye Sen and said with a face full of tears, “A Ye, can’t You Forgive Daddy?” ”

“”You can go out first.”Ye Sen continued, “I don’t want to see you for the time being.” ”

For the time being.

Ye Sen said for the time being.

This meant that ye Sen still had his father in his heart.

“Father Zhao continued, “Then Daddy will go home first. You should rest well in the hospital. Daddy will come and See You Tomorrow.” ”

“After leaving the hospital, Father Zhao called Mike and said angrily, “Mike, don’t you know that you are too bold! You even dare to come to the hospital! What if someone finds out?” ”

“Mike, who was opposite him, chuckled, “Mr. Zhao, I remember that there is an idiom in your country called worrying over nothing.” ”

“”You’re lucky that Ye Zao didn’t recognize you this time!”Father Zhao continued, “I’m begging you, can you please leave this place as soon as possible!” ”

He was lucky?

It was obvious that ye Zao was not capable enough.

“Father Zhao described ye Zao as a god, and Mike really thought that ye Zao was powerful. ”

So that was all.

“”Mr. Zhao,”mike sneered, “Are all Chinese people as timid as you?” ”

“Mike! You Should Leave Now! I’ll give you another three million!”Father Zhao continued.

“The more father Zhao was like this, the more Mike didn’t want to leave. ”

He wanted to see how capable ye Zhuo was!

“Mike!”

Father Zhao looked at the cut-off call again and was so angry that his face turned red.

“On this side, Mike. ”

“Just in case, he logged onto the website again and cleaned up all the surveillance footage on the day of the incident. ”

“Then, he contacted Joe. ”

[ can you restore the surveillance footage at this time? ]

“Joe replied very quickly, [ don’t worry, you cleaned it up very well. I’m afraid even Z won’t be able to restore it. ] ”

Hacker z appeared out of nowhere two years ago.

“Although Joe was the number one in C nation, in front of Z, he couldn’t even be compared to a shadow. ”

Z was someone the Hacker Alliance couldn’t invite!

“Seeing Joe’s reply, Mike was relieved. ”

The surveillance camera was the only evidence.

“But if even z could not recover the surveillance camera, could the Chinese? ”

Ye Zhoneng?

At the hospital.

“Ye Sen felt that the ward was quite boring. In addition, too many things had happened that day. For a moment, he could not digest it, so he came to the back garden of the hospital to take a look. ”

“The garden was covered in white snow, and a few red plums were blooming in the cold. ”

“The sunlight shone on the snow, reflecting a golden light. ”

“Brother Ye!”

“At this moment, a surprised female voice came from behind. ”

“Ye Sen turned around and said in surprise, “De Ning?” ”

That’s right.

The person who called him was Gu de Ning.

“Gu De Ning pushed a middle-aged woman in a wheelchair over. “Brother Ye, are you hurt?” ”

“It’s just a minor injury. It’s nothing.”Ye Sen looked at the middle-aged woman in the wheelchair. “Is this Auntie?”

“Gu deling said a little embarrassedly, “This is my sister.” ”

Gu deling was an old woman from her parents. Her sister was 23 years older than her.
