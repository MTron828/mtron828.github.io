“Miss Ye.”

Aunt Lang received a call from CEN Shaoqing 30 minutes ago.

He said that he would bring a friend over for dinner.

“In the past, Cen Shaoqing always brought his friends over for dinner. ”

But he had never brought a member of the opposite sex over.

She did not expect that he would bring a little girl over this time.

“Moreover, she was so beautiful. ”

Aunt Lang had known Cen Shaoqing for eleven years.

“All these years, Cen Shaoqing had been eating vegetarian and chanting Buddhism. ”

Aunt Lang had once thought that he would become a monk.

She did not expect that.

“This time, she was finally enlightened. ”

“”Please come in, please come in.”Aunt Lang welcomed them in. ”

“After passing through layers of beaded curtains, Aunt Lang led the two to a small private room. ”

“The private room was located on the west side of the courtyard house. As long as the beaded curtains by the window were pulled open, one would be able to see the scenery of the courtyard house. ”

“The Breeze blew gently, and the silk bamboo entered one’s ears. ”

It was a very elegant environment.

“As soon as the two of them sat down, Aunt Lang brought two cups of soup. ”

“As soon as ye Zhuo removed the lid, he smelled a pungent fragrance. ”

It was a very mellow earthen chicken soup.

There was a layer of butter floating on the soup.

“After a mouthful of the soup, there was a lingering fragrance on his lips and teeth, which made people sigh involuntarily. ”

Ye Zhuo looked up at Cen Shaoqing. “What kind of soup is yours?”

“”Vegetable soup and mushroom soup.”CEN Shaoqing continued, “Do you want to try it?” ”

“Ye Zhuo said that he didn’t want it, but his hand still handed the bowl to her very honestly. ”

Cen Shaoqing scooped the soup into her bowl.

Although it was a vegetable soup.

“But the vegetables were mixed with the flavor of mushrooms, and it was very delicious. ”

“After drinking the soup, it was the main dish. ”

“There weren’t many portions of the dishes, but each one was very exquisite, and it felt like eating Michelin. ”

“Perhaps Cen Shaoqing had told her in advance, but after the meal, Aunt Lang even brought a dessert over. ”

“CEN Shaoqing said, “Aunt Lang isn’t a local. The dessert she made is a specialty of their hometown. It’s hard to get authentic in other places. See if it suits your taste.” ”

Ye Zhuo nodded and opened the lid of the dessert.

“Once the lid was opened, a strong fragrance of Osmanthus was smelled. ”

“The soup was clear and bright. It did not look good, but the taste was surprisingly good. ”

Layers of taste buds were opened.

It was irresistible.

“How is the taste?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“”Very good!”Ye Zhuo gave him a thumbs up. “By the way, why don’t you eat it?” ”

“CEN Shaoqing said, “I’m not used to the taste of Osmanthus.” ”

“OH.”Ye Zhuo nodded.

“After eating the dessert, ye Zhuo used the time to go to the bathroom to ask Aunt Lang for the bill. ”

“Aunt Lang smiled and said, “Shaoqing is my VIP annual customer, so you don’t have to pay.” ”

“OH.”Ye Zhuo nodded.

“Aunt Lang continued, “Miss Ye, you’re not a local, right?” ” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Ye Zao nodded. “I’m from Yun Capital.”

“After chatting with Aunt Lang for a while, Ye Zao returned to his seat. ”

“Cen Shaoqing leaned against the back of his chair, holding a Buddhist bead in his hand. Judging from the shape of his mouth, he was probably reciting Buddhist scriptures. ”

Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly. This person was indeed worthy of being a monk.

“It’s getting late. Shall we go back?”Ye Zao leaned forward slightly and tapped the table with his fingers.

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and stood up from his chair.

“Aunt Lang personally sent them off. “Miss Ye, this is your first time here. This is a gift from me to you. It’s not a valuable trinket. You must accept it.” ”

“”Thank you, Aunt Lang.”Ye Zao received the small box from Aunt Lang with both hands. ”

“As long as Miss Ye doesn’t mind it.”

“Why would I?”

“The driver was waiting outside. When he saw the two of them walk out of the car in half a month, he immediately opened the car door. ”

Ye Zhuo sat inside.

Cen Shaoqing followed.

The two of them sat in the back seat.

The DIM yellow headlights coated the two of them with a layer of light.

Ye Zhuo opened the box that Aunt Lang had given him.

He saw that inside the box was a lifelike woven grasshopper.

“It’s so exquisite. It looks so real.”Ye Zhuo exclaimed.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Aunt Lang made this up herself, but it’s been many years since she made it up.” ”

“Really?”Ye Zhuo looked back.

“Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and continued, “Do you know why Little Half Moon is called Little Half Moon?” ”

Ye Zhuo shook his head.

“CEN Shaoqing said, “Little Half Moon is Aunt Lang’s daughter’s name. Unfortunately, Little Half Moon and Aunt Lang got lost when she was three years old. There was no news of them ever since. Aunt Lang’s hair turned white overnight. Later on, she opened such a restaurant in the place where Little Half Moon went missing.” ”

Ye Zhuo frowned slightly. “Did Aunt Lang find Little Half Moon later?”

“”No.”CEN Shaoqing continued, “Aunt Lang waited here for more than thirty years, but her child seemed to have vanished from the world.” ”
