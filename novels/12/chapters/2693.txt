Translator: 549690339

“Although the Lin family was a high-class family in the capital, their morals were not good. ”

He looked down on such people from the bottom of his heart.

“Feng Yang continued, “Ziyue, why don’t you and Auntie Come Back Too? Don’t stay there any longer.” ”

“Zhou Ziyue sighed. “I don’t want to continue staying here either. It depends on their expressions, but I can’t do anything about it. My mother is too loyal...” ”

“”Alright then.”Although Feng Yang felt sorry for Zhou Ziyue, this was after all Zhou Ziyue’s family matter, so he couldn’t interfere, then, he said, “Take care of yourself. Don’t let others bully you. If anyone bullies you, give me a call.” ”

“”Okay.”Zhou ziyue continued, “Then where shall we meet tomorrow?” ”

“Feng Yang said, “Where do you live?” ”

“”Downtown,”Zhou Ziyue replied. ”

“Feng yang smiled and said, “It just so happens that I’m also in the downtown area. Then, can we meet on the first floor of the Biluo Building at 10 o’clock Tomorrow Morning?” ”

“”Sure.”Zhou ziyue continued, “Then we’ll meet tomorrow.” ”

“See You Tomorrow.”

“After hanging up the phone with Feng Yang, Zhou Ziyue felt a little uncomfortable and even a little breathless. ”

“The more she thought about Ma Lu’s face, the more obvious this feeling became. ”

What should she do?

Should she really make things clear with Feng Yang Tomorrow?

“From now on, she would spend the rest of her life with that Ugly Freak? ”

No.

She was not convinced.

On what basis?

On what basis would fate treat her like this.

“Zhou Ziyue held her phone tightly, her expression unclear. ”

“At this moment, the tightly shut door was pushed open. ”

The person pushing the door was none other than ye Sui.

“Looking at ye Sui’s expression, she knew that she had been eavesdropping outside the door for a long time. ”

“Seeing ye Sui, Zhou Ziyue said angrily, “You eavesdropped on me!” ”

“I’m your mother! What do you mean by eavesdropping!”Ye Sui said.

“Zhou ziyue continued, “What exactly do you want to do?” ”

“”What do I want to Do? I want you to break up with Feng Yang as soon as possible!”Ye Sui pointed at Zhou Ziyue and said, “When you meet Feng Yang Tomorrow, don’t delay anymore!” ”

Zhou Ziyue didn’t say anything.

“”If you continue to get involved with Feng Yang, I won’t have a daughter like you in the future!”Ye Sui continued, “I’ve already helped you to find out. The Ma family’s family background can be counted on one hand in the capital. Even many big stars are fighting to be the MA family’s daughter-in-law! Don’t you know what’s good for you!” ”

“This was a blessing that many people could not hope for. Zhou Ziyue, on the other hand, wasted this opportunity for nothing. ”

“After saying that, ye Sui continued, “If you follow Ma Lu, your children will be the second generation of the rich. If you follow Feng Yang, you will be the second generation of the rich! Think it through yourself!” ”

“Some things had to be thought through by the authorities themselves. Otherwise, it would be futile for others to say anything more. ”

“Zhou Ziyue was feeling very uncomfortable now, especially when ye Sui said those words. ”

She knew very well what it meant to be a rich second generation or a negative second generation.

“”With how Ma Lu looks like, how good can our descendants be?”Zhou Ziyue asked in return. ”

“Actually, this was also what Zhou Ziyue was most worried about. ”

Genes were the most powerful. What if their children in the future all inherited Ma Lu’s genes?

Who Didn’t like beautiful girls?

Especially girls.

“Ye Sui continued, “I’ve already asked around for you. The reason why Ma Lu became like this is not because he looked like this from the beginning!” ”

“What do you mean?”Zhou Ziyue asked.

“Ye Sui explained, “Bai Jingshu told me that Ma Lu had a car accident before, that’s why she became like this. The Ma Lu in the past was also a handsome young man. So, you don’t have to worry about your descendants.” ”

“Really?”Zhou Ziyue asked in surprise.

“”Really.”Ye Sui nodded, “Ninety percent of the reason for this appearance is because of heredity. This Ma family is rich and powerful. How Could Ma Lu’s father marry an ugly monster? So, you should know what’s going on even if you think about it with your toes!” ”

“I see.”Zhou ziyue came to a sudden realization. The doubts that had accumulated in her heart over the past few days disappeared completely.

“Seeing Zhou Ziyue like this, ye Sui’s attitude was also much better, he continued, “Ziyue, you are my daughter. There has never been a mother in this world who would harm her own daughter. So, you must seize the opportunity to turn the tables. If you miss this opportunity, you will never be able to turn the tables in the future.” ”

“Ye Sui’s attitude suddenly changed from strong to weak, which made Zhou Ziyue somewhat at a loss. ”

She began to reflect on whether what she said earlier was too much.

“Ye Sui looked at Zhou Ziyue’s expression and sighed, then he said, “Your father and I have been ordinary people all our lives. We’ve worked for others all our lives. We know the hardships of living under someone else’s roof. Ziyue, you’re different. You have a chance to change your fate now. I hope you can grasp it firmly and not waste this opportunity.” ”

“Zhou Ziyue nodded. “Yes, Mom, I understand.” ”

“”It’s good that you understand.”Ye Sui patted Zhou Ziyue’s hand, “Actually, Feng Yang is also a good child. Unfortunately, his family’s conditions are a little poor. If you really marry him, then you can only live like your mother for the rest of your life.” ”

“Hearing this, Zhou Ziyue looked up at ye Sui. ”

“Although ye Sui was ye Shu’s sister, she was only two years older than ye Shu. However, the bright and beautiful ye Shu looked like she was only in her early thirties. But what about ye Sui? ”

“Because of her constant fatigue, she looked old and haggard. ”

No.

She couldn’t live like ye Sui

She wanted to live a beautiful life!

“Ye Sui grabbed Zhou Ziyue’s hand at the right time. “Ziyue, the saddest thing in a person’s life is to choose the wrong path.” ”

“Okay.”Zhou Ziyue nodded again.

Ye Sui looked at Zhou Ziyue and was already confident.

“In the blink of an eye, the next day arrived. ”

Zhou Ziyue arrived at the address that she had agreed to with Feng Yang.

Feng Yang had been waiting for her since a long time ago.

“When he saw Zhou Ziyue come over, Feng Yang immediately trotted over. “Ziyue.” ”

“Feng Yang.”

Zhou Ziyue smiled and hugged Feng Yang. “Have you been waiting for a long time?”

Feng Yang helped Zhou Ziyue to brush her hair. “I just arrived too.”

“Really?”

“Really.”

“Just like Zhou Ziyue, he had given his heart to Zhou Ziyue. ”

It was not easy for the two of them to love each other for ten years.

“Feng Yang held Zhou Ziyue’s hand tightly and asked, “When is Auntie going back?” ”

Zhou Ziyue shook her head. “I’m not sure yet.”

“Feng Yang frowned slightly and continued, “Since your aunt’s family is not friendly to you, why don’t You Leave?” ”

“Hearing that, Zhou Ziyue sighed, “Firstly, my mother is more loyal. She just went to my aunt’s house not long ago. If she left so soon, she would definitely be discussed by those acquaintances in her hometown. My aunt looks down on her poor relatives. “So, my mother didn’t leave because of my aunt’s face.” ”

“In just a few words, ye Sui was molded into a good sister who was thinking of her younger sister. ”

“What about the second reason?”Feng Yang asked.

“Zhou ziyue continued, “The second reason is because of my brother.” ”

“Libang?”Feng Yang asked.

“Zhou Ziyue nodded. “You know my brother. Not only does he not have any abilities, but he is also ambitious. My mother and father are very worried about her. They hope that my aunt can help libang find a good job.” ”

“”I see.”Feng yang nodded and continued, “The hearts of all parents are pitiful. However, asking your aunt for help is not a solution. Libang still has to set his own goals.” ”

It was better to rely on oneself than to rely on anyone else.

“A bitter smile appeared on Zhou Ziyue’s face. “Although that’s what you said, in the eyes of parents, if you can help your child, you must help him.” ”

“”That’s true.”Feng Yang reached out and put his arm around Zhou Ziyue’s shoulder. “But if you can persuade me, you can persuade Auntie. Libang still has to rely on himself.” ”

“”Yes, I know.”Zhou Ziyue nodded. ”

“Feng yang smiled and said, “Let’s not talk about these unhappy topics. I know a delicious coconut chicken restaurant upstairs. Shall we have coconut chicken for lunch?” ”

“Sure.”

The two of them went to the restaurant upstairs.

“After lunch, Zhou Ziyue went to watch a movie with Feng Yang. ”

“Zhou Ziyue looked at the tall and handsome Feng Yang beside her and held his hand tightly. She tried to say something, but every time the words reached her mouth, she swallowed them. ”

How should she tell Feng Yang?

Zhou Ziyue bit her lips.

“Feng Yang saw that something was wrong with Zhou Ziyue. He turned to look at Zhou Ziyue and said, “Ziyue, what’s wrong? Are you not feeling well?” ”

“”No.”Zhou Ziyue shook her head. “Feng Yang, I have something to tell you.” ”

“What?”Feng Yang looked at Zhou Ziyue.

“Zhou ziyue continued, “Let’s break up.” ”
