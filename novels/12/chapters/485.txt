Translator: 549690339

Z was so young?

So Cold?

Could it be... that they had entered the wrong room?

“W stood up and said, “Beauty, may I know who you’re looking for?” ”

“”I’m Looking for w,”ye Zhuo’s tone was clear. ”

Looking for W?

Could it be that this was Z?

It would be a lie to say that they were not shocked.

The three of them were stunned!

“W was the first to react. He stuttered, “You, you are Z?” ”

“”You are W?”Ye Zao raised his eyes, revealing a pair of clear black and white eyes. ”

“His eyebrows were as beautiful as a painting, and there was a hint of scorn in his coldness. ”

Lin Ze was stunned.

She did not expect ye Zao to be z.

“If she had not seen it with her own eyes, who would have believed that a chemistry department genius was actually a computer expert. ”

Z caused a stir in the hacker world last summer.

“Last Summer, China International’s official website was maliciously attacked by foreign hackers, and the words ‘sick man of East Asia’were left behind. ”

“For two days in a row, countless hackers and top programmers were at a loss. ”

Until the appearance of Hacker Z.

“Z not only repaired the international official website and strengthened the firewall, but also openly attacked the official websites of both countries under the noses of many hackers from country J and Country P, adhering to the etiquette of not returning the favor, he left a line of words on the official websites of both countries: those who offend China, although far away, must be killed! ”

“There were more than 3,000 top hackers from both sides, but they were unable to solve this problem. ”

“In desperation, they could only self-seal the website. ”

Abandoning the pawn to protect the cart.

“For a time, the entire hacker world was in an uproar! ”

“Because of this, Z also became the first hacker to go on an international kill order. ”

He became the pursuer of both countries.

The reward was 500 qiu te coins.

Qiu Te coins were universal coins.

“One Qiu te coin could be exchanged for 50,000 RMB. ”

Unfortunately.

It had been more than a year. Forget about chasing after the Hacker Z.

“Even the hacker z was tall, short, fat, and thin. It was impossible to know if he was a man or a woman. ”

“If those people knew that the hacker who offered a reward of tens of millions was just an ordinary female university student, how depressed would they be? ”

“For a moment, Lin Ze was extremely shocked. ”

“”Yes, yes, yes! I’m W!”W was too excited, he did not expect that not only was Z not an old man, but she was actually such an imposing beauty. “God, let me introduce you. This is my cousin. This is a friend of my cousin.” ”

“Xiao Dan quickly stood up. “God, you can just call me Xiao Dan.” ”

Xiao Dan was from Qing Hua University next door.

“Even though ye Zhuo was the campus belle of Jing University, she was too popular during military training. That dynamic picture was still spreading like wildfire. ”

“It had already spread from Jing city to other universities, becoming the goddess of first love in the hearts of countless scholars. ”

Xiao Dan did not expect that the campus belle of Jing University was actually Hacker Z!

This was too exciting!

“”Brother Ze, aren’t you also from Peking University?”Xiao Dan looked at Lin Ze. “You and the campus belle are both campus Belle and Campus Belle. You should know each other, right?” ” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Lin Ze stood up and extended his hand to Ye Zhuo. “Hello, I’m Lin Ze. I’ve heard a lot about you.” ”

“Seeing Lin Ze, Ye Zhuo was also stunned. ”

She had clearly never seen Lin ze before.

She actually had the illusion that she had known Lin Ze for a long time.

“Moreover, she saw ye Shu’s shadow in Lin Ze’s eyes. ”

“Especially that pair of phoenix eyes, they were exactly the same as ye Shu’s. ”

“If ye Zhuo did not know ye Shu very well, she would even suspect that this was ye Shu’s illegitimate child. ”

“Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and reached out to hold Lin Ze’s hand. “Hello, Ye Zhuo.” ”

“After saying that, ye Zao continued, “Have you brought the things?” ”

Lin Ze nodded and took out his laptop from his bag. “I’ll be counting on you.”

“After ye Zao took the laptop, he went back to work. ”

“Other than the melodious singing, there was only the sound of typing. ”

The other three looked at ye Zao.

They were afraid of missing out on something.

W was very excited!

“He wanted to take a photo to brag in the group, but he was afraid of exposing ye Zao’s identity as Z. ”

“So, W had to suppress his excitement. ”

Five minutes later.

“Ye Zao looked up slightly. “The password has been deciphered, 1981114.” ”

1981114?

Lin Ze frowned.

This was obviously a person’s birthday.

Lin Jin city was in the 1980s.

Could it be...

This was his birth mother’s birthday?

“Xiao Dan asked curiously, “Brother Ze, is this your father’s Birthday?” ”

Lin Ze shook his head. “My Father’s birthday is in the 1980s.”

“Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows, feeling that it was a little strange. ”

“Because ye Shu’s birthday was in 1981, and her birthday was on November 14th. ”

Was this just a coincidence?

“Xiao Dan said, “Could it be your mother’s Birthday?” ”

“”It’s possible.”Lin Ze picked up the computer and continued, “God Ye, thank you for today!” ”
