“”I took in a disciple before. He is very talented, but unfortunately, his ambition is not in the literary world!””

“After saying that, master yu continued, “Zao Zao, I have never asked for anything from anyone in my life. As long as you agree to acknowledge me as your master, I will agree to any conditions!””

It had always been people who begged Master Yu to acknowledge them as his master.

Ye Zhuo was the first person to be begged by Master Yu to accept a disciple.

“If outsiders were to see this, they would probably die of envy.”

Ye Zhuo hesitated.

She had no intention of joining the literary world.

“At this moment, assistant Ma seemed to have thought of something. He lowered his head and whispered a few words into master Yu’s ear.”

“Hearing this, master Yu’s eyes lit up. He looked at ye Zao and said, “Zao Zao, as long as you agree to become my master, I’ll treat you to the best dessert in the world!””

The best dessert?

Ye Zao raised his eyes slightly. “Really?”

“”Of course, of course!””

“”Alright, then I’ll agree to it!”Not only would there be no loss in agreeing to become master Yu’s master, but he could also eat the best dessert in the world. This was not a loss in business.”

“Good! That’s Great!”Master Yu stood up excitedly. “Sear Sear! Then it’s a deal! You Can’t go back on your word!”

“”Don’t worry, I never go back on my word.””

“That’s good.”Master Yu nodded. “The ceremony will be held in three days. You must come on time!”

“Okay.”

“After settling this matter, master Yu went to the ceremony.”

“When Old Lady Lin heard that Master Yu was preparing for the ceremony in the capital city, she quickly came over and asked, “Jingshan, I heard that you are going to take in a disciple?””

“”Yes!”Master Yu said very excitedly, “Sister-in-law, you have raised a good granddaughter!””

A good granddaughter?

“Old Lady Lin smiled and said, “So, you are going to take in my granddaughter as a disciple?”The granddaughter that Old Lady Lin was referring to was Feng Qianxian. After all, she had always treated Feng Qianxian as her biological granddaughter.”

“In reality, she had never thought of ye Zao at all.”

“After all, she had mentioned ye Zao in front of Master Yu before.”

“Master Yu nodded. “Yes! I am preparing to hold a master-acknowledging banquet in three days. At that time, old sister-in-law, you must come and support me!””

“Old Lady Lin continued, “That is only natural!””

“If she did not come to Feng Qianxian’s master-acknowledging banquet, who else would?”

“After learning that Master Yu was going to take Feng Xianxian as his disciple, Old Lady Lin immediately told Feng Xianxian the good news.” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Feng Xianxian was extremely excited. She wished she could announce to the world that she was going to become master Yu’s last disciple.

“In the blink of an eye, it was time for the master ceremony.”

9 am.

The banquet was held at a famous five-star hotel in the capital city. Master Yu invited many literary scholars to personally witness the master ceremony.

“Rather than calling it a ceremony, it was more like a banquet where Master Yu announced his successor.”

Everyone was guessing who would be able to take over master Yu’s mantle.

“I heard that the other party is only a nineteen-year-old girl. I wonder what kind of Medicine Master Yu is selling!”

“That’s right! I’ve heard about it too!”

Old Lady Lin appeared at the banquet venue with Feng Xianxian dressed appropriately.

Feng Xianxian curled her lips slightly when she heard everyone’s discussion.

“They hadn’t even seen her true face yet, and they were already so surprised.”

“When Master Yu announced that she was the successor in public, these people would definitely be even more surprised.”

“At this moment, she saw a familiar figure appear in the banquet hall.”

That Was?

Ye Zao?

This was her apprenticeship banquet. What was ye Zao doing here?

Embarrassing?
