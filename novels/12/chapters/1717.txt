“Hearing this, Feng Ying felt relieved. ”

She was really afraid that her grandmother would have no one to care for her in her old age.

“Now that she heard that Professor Feng did not ignore the old lady, Feng Ying was not worried anymore. After all, it was the old lady who did not want to come with Professor Feng. ”

“C country was one of the few developed countries in the world, and it was also a holy place for the elderly. If the old lady came to C country, she could at least live for a few more years. ”

“However, she was not willing to come. This could not be blamed on others. ”

“”That’s good.”Feng Ying continued, “Auntie Wu is very tired taking care of Grandma alone. Mom, remember to send her more money every month.” ”

“”Don’t worry, I will.”Professor Feng nodded. ”

“Feng Ying took the suitcase from Professor Feng. “Then mom, let’s go in quickly.” ”

Professor Feng turned around and greeted director Ma and the others before following Feng Ying into the villa.

Feng Ying had moved into the villa ten days ago.

The villa was already very cozy.

“Feng Ying put away her luggage and asked, “Mom, are we going to be neighbors with Uncle Ma and the others from now on?” ”

“”Yes.”Professor Feng nodded. “Ying Ying, you have to learn to greet them in the future. Why Don’t you say anything when you see Uncle Ma and the others?” ”

“Got it.”

At the same time.

On the other side.

Dr. Cara and Jamila had returned to the base camp.

“The assistant immediately walked over. “Dr. Cara, this is the important information we extracted from the analysis report of the volcanic crystal. Please take a look.” ”

“Dr. Cara took the information and looked at it carefully. After a while, Dr. Cara laughed out loud, “YC is really smart and muddle-headed. She definitely didn’t expect that even though our country C didn’t land on Mars, we still got the analysis report of the volcanic crystal. Moreover, we got it all without any effort.” ”

“Gamira smiled and said, “In the end, it’s the Chinese who are soft-hearted.”If it weren’t for Professor Feng and director Ma, they wouldn’t have gotten the report of the volcanic crystal so easily. ”

“Dr. Cara nodded and continued, “Inform them to immediately start the plan to land on Europa.” ”

Europa was a very valuable planet.

“Currently, ye Zao had misjudged Europa. He thought that Europa was a planet with no value and gave them a chance. ”

“Therefore, country C must land in Europa before ye Zao could react and not give ye Zao a chance to regret. ”

“”Okay.”Jamila nodded. “By the way, Dr. Cara, do you think there’s anything wrong with this volcanic crystal analysis report?” ”

“What’s Wrong?”Dr. Cara turned his head.

“Jamila continued, “I always feel that this analysis report is too simple.” ”

The volcanic crystal analysis report was a very confidential document. Why would professor Feng and director Ma suddenly see it?

“Dr. Cara did not take this matter to heart. She continued, “How Old is YC? In the end, she is just a child. How can you expect a child to have leadership?” ”

YC was only in her early twenties.

“Her technological talent was undeniable, but talent and leadership were two different things. ”

“Hearing this, Jamila nodded. ”

“Dr. Cara continued, “I heard that Professor Feng has a very outstanding disciple, Liu Yuan, who is still in the Cen’s base. It would be even better if her disciple could be poached!” ”

“”I’m afraid that’s a little difficult to achieve,”said Jamila. ”

“Why?”Dr. Cara asked.

“Jamila continued, “They come from different backgrounds. Liu Yuan’s grandfather is a veteran of the anti-japanese war.” ”

“Before this, Jamila had wanted to Rope Liu Yuan in as well, but after some investigation, he found that Liu Yuan was not quite the same as he had imagined. ”

“Liu Yuan was very patriotic. Because her ex-boyfriend had a quarter of Japanese ancestry, she resolutely broke up with her ex-boyfriend. ”

“Is that so?”

“Yes.”

“Professor cara sighed and continued, “That’s such a pity!” ”

...

The Lin family.

“When Little White came downstairs after charging, it saw that there was a new member in the family. It said in surprise, “My God! Why is there a demolition director in our family?” ”

“Demolition class director? Who?”Ye Shu walked out of the restaurant with breakfast in her hands. “Who in our family is the demolition class director?”

“It!”Little White pointed at the Fat Dog on the ground and said. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“The chubby dog was chewing on its slippers and playing with them. When it heard this, it seemed to understand Little White’s words. It tilted its head and looked at little white. ”

It was silly and cute.

Little White couldn’t stand this kind of tilting of its head. Its eyes were almost sparkling. “Oh my God! This dog is too cute! I feel that it’s not the cutest little puppy in the Universe!”
