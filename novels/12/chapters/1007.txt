Xi Muwen furrowed his brows tightly.

“At this point, Yang Jiao said again, “You said that we’ve finally planned for such a long time. If we were to fall into the hands of this crazy woman, wouldn’t it be futile?” ”

“Does Weiyue know about this?”Xi Muwen asked.

“Yang Jiao said, “It was Weiyue who told me.” ”

“Xi Weiyue was different from Yang Jiao. She was very much like Xi Muwen. She was thoughtful. As long as she could achieve her goal, she would do anything. ”

“Xi Muwen narrowed his eyes and said, “Go and call Weiyue over.” ”

“Okay.”Yang Jiao nodded. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Not long after, Yang Jiao brought Xi Weiyue in. ”

“Xi Muwen looked up at Xi Weiyue. “Just now, your mother told me about it. What do you think we should do?” ”

“XI weiyue said, “Now that the paternity test has been done, it’s definitely impossible to change the person. The only way now is for us to cooperate with her.” ”

“What do you say?”Xi Muwen asked.

Xi Weiyue whispered her plan to XI Muwen.

“Xi Muwen nodded. “Alright, we’ll do it according to what you say.” ”

“Yang Jiao said, “Then, should I go and bring the person over now?” ”

“MMM.”Xi Muwen nodded.

Yang Jiao walked out.

In the room for half a month.

Half a month was still in a daze as she allowed Yang Jiao to bring her to the study room.

“I want candy and a Little Bear Biscuit...”

“Seeing half a month like this, Xi Muwen narrowed his eyes. ”

“This crazy woman, has she really returned to normal? ”

Xi Weiyue stood up and looked at half a month. “Stop pretending. I know you’ve returned to normal.”

Half a month acted as if she did not hear Xi Weiyue’s words and continued to talk to herself.

“Still pretending?”Xi Weiyue walked to half a month’s side and grabbed her wrist.

Xi Muwen narrowed his eyes.

He did not know how Xi Weiyue could tell that this woman had returned to normal!

He looked at her and saw that this woman was still acting crazy.

Was there a mistake?

“Xi Muwen was about to speak when he saw the half-moon who was still acting crazy suddenly shake Xi Weiyue’s hand away. “Since you’ve seen through it, then I won’t pretend anymore.” ”

“In an instant, the woman’s expression changed. ”

Xi Muwen was stunned.

“The woman turned to look at XI weiyue and continued, “What? Are you trying to expose me? Don’t forget, we’re all in the same boat now. Don’t think I don’t know that you’re trying to use me to gain that old woman’s Trust!”Through their interactions these past few days, the woman could see Xi Muwen’s family’s motive. ”

“However, what she did not know was what their true motive was. ”

What exactly did ye Langhua have that was worth the family of three going through so much trouble for.

“Because she knew that the family of three only came to her because she was not in her right mind, so after she regained her consciousness, she continued to pretend to be crazy. ”

She did not expect XI weiyue to see through it.

Xi Weiyue was smarter than she thought. She actually saw through her act!

Xi Weiyue smiled. “You’re very smart. I like to deal with smart people.”

The woman narrowed her eyes. “What do you mean?”

“XI weiyue continued, “Shall we work together?” ”

“Work together?”The woman asked back.

Xi Weiyue nodded. “That’s right. Working together can lead to a win-win situation.”

“How do I know if you guys will burn the bridge after crossing it?”The woman asked.

“Xi Weiyue smiled, “The only path before you now is to cooperate with us. If you refuse to cooperate with us, then we’ll fight to the death. In the future, I’ll still be the Xi family’s eldest daughter, and you’ll have to return to the aid station.” ”

“Are you threatening me?”The woman narrowed her eyes.

Xi Weiyue glanced at the woman. “That’s the truth.”

The woman lowered her eyes.

“Yang Jiao stood up and said, “I say, big sister, what’s there to think about? As long as you promise us, you’ll have endless wealth and glory in the future. Do you still want to return to the rescue station?” ”

“Of course, she did not want to return to the rescue station! ”

“Xi Weiyue answered at the right time, “If you want to return to the rescue station, I can send you back now.” ”

“”Okay!”The woman looked up at Xi Weiyue, “I Promise You!” ”

“”A wise man submits to circumstances!”XI weiyue nodded and continued, “What’s Your Name?” ”

“”My name is Jiang Yan.”Jiang Yan continued, “By the way, that old woman is starting to suspect you guys. She thought I was asleep just now and secretly pulled out my hair. I guess she’s going to take my hair for an appraisal.” ”
