Chapter 158: 085: “Lovely Old Lady Cen, my granddaughter-in-law is the most beautiful woman in the world!”! 2

Could it be that all teenagers are like this?

What they think is what they do?

Xia Xiaoman’s brows furrowed tighter and tighter.

“Mom,”an Lizi tried her best to calm herself down and smiled at Xia Xiaoman. “I’m fine.”

Xia Xiaoman sighed and continued, “Lizi, I know that the children you have now are different from the ones in Mom’s era. If there’s anything, you must tell mom and dad, Okay?”

An Lizi nodded and her nose turned sour. She reached out and hugged Xia Xiaoman. “Mom...”

“What’s Wrong?”Xia Xiaoman was stunned. “Lizi, were you bullied at school? If you were bullied, you must tell mom...”

An Lizi sniffled. “Mom, I’m fine. I just watched a horror movie on the Internet yesterday. I’m a little scared thinking about it now.”

Xia Xiaoman smiled and said, “How old are you already? You’re still so scared after watching a horror movie! That’s all fake...”

At this point, Xia Xiaoman paused, then she said, “Lizi, you’re already a senior year student now. Mom doesn’t object to watching a horror movie occasionally to relieve your stress. But while watching a horror movie, you can’t forget to study, okay? You have to learn to combine work and rest.”

“Okay.”An Lizi nodded.

“Alright, Go Wash your face and eat.”Xia Xiaoman patted an Lizi’s shoulder.

An Lizi went to wash her face.

......

An dongliang only got up after eating half of his breakfast.

Xia Xiaoman immediately squeezed the toothpaste and passed it to an Dongliang. Then, she poured water for him to wash his face.

She served him meticulously.

After washing his face, an Dongliang went to the kitchen. An dongliang glanced at the pot. “What do you want to Eat This Morning?”

“I cooked red bean porridge and bought fried dough sticks.”Xia Xiaoman continued, “I’ve already prepared the porridge for you. It’s on the table.”

An dongliang frowned. “Why are you eating fried dough sticks again?”They had been eating fried dough sticks for a month.

Xia Xiaoman took off her apron and smiled. “What do you want to eat then? I’ll buy it for you.”

An Dongliang thought for a moment. “Buy a scallion pancake and bring two he ji meat buns.”

“Alright.”Xia Xiaoman nodded. “Wait at home for a while.”

If this was any other time, this would be a normal thing.

This was because in an Lizi’s impression, her mother had always been very good to her father.

But now, an Lizi was extremely angry!

She even felt that her mother had fed the dog with deep affection.

Ever since she saw an Dongliang with that woman, she could not stand to see her father being so mean to her mother!

Her mother was so good to him!

How could he treat her like this!

How could he do this!

“He can eat whatever he wants. Mom, don’t spoil him!”An Lizi reached out to stop Xia Xiaoman.

“What’s wrong with you?”Xia Xiaoman was speechless.

An Lizi took a deep breath.

An Dongliang walked out of the kitchen and placed his hands on an Lizi’s shoulders, he smiled and said, “What’s wrong with my baby girl? Why are you still angry with Daddy? Did Daddy do something wrong recently? Tell Daddy, Daddy can change it immediately!”

An Dongliang was still the same as before. He was a reasonable and amiable father.

However, an Lizi could see the hypocrisy on his face.

There was a thick layer of hypocrisy.

“It’s nothing.”An Lizi broke free from an Dongliang’s hand. “I’m going to school.”

“This child.”An Dongliang looked at an Lizi’s back view and shook his head helplessly.

His daughter had grown up.

She had her own thoughts.

Although an Dongliang felt that this was a little strange, he did not take it to heart.

It was normal for children to have their own little secrets and tempers when they grew up.

As parents, one must not interfere too much with their children’s secrets.

An Lizi was absent-minded all the way to the school gate.

Yesterday, she and Zhao Pingting were waiting for ye Zao.

Today, Ye Zao and Zhao Pingting were waiting for her.

“Lizi!”Zhao Pingting waved at her.

“Zao Zao, Pingting.”An Lizi jogged over.

Zhao pingting continued, “Lizi, were you alright last night? You ran away before you finished eating. Later, Mama Zao even gave each of us a big gift bag! Oh right, this is yours.”

Zhao Pingting handed an Lizi a handbag.

An Lizi looked up at ye Zao. “Zao Zao, please thank Auntie for me.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“You’re welcome.”Ye Zao looked at an Lizi. “By the way, Lizi, did you not sleep well last night?”

An Lizi was in a bad mood and looked listless.

As a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner, ye Zao could tell at a glance that something was wrong with her.
