“The Secretary had worked in the CEN group for such a long time, but he had never seen anyone who dared to be so arrogant in front of Cen Wu Ye! ”

The secretary gulped. “N-no more.”

Cen Shaoqing unscrewed the cap of the Coke bottle and handed it to Ye Zao. “Leave the documents there. I’ll sign them later. You can go out First!”

“Okay.”The secretary bent down and turned to leave the office.

“Even when she walked out of the office, the Secretary was stunned. ”

“”Xiao Zhu, how is it? Have you seen our CEO’s wife?”A colleague saw Xiao Zhu walk out and asked curiously. ”

Xiao Zhu nodded.

Another two colleagues surrounded her. “Is Miss ye good-looking?”

“Xiao Zhu licked his lips. “I, I didn’t dare to look her in the eye.” ”

“At that time, Cen Shaoqing was standing right next to Ye Zao. How could he dare to look at her? ”

“Look at how useless you are?”

“”If you can do it, you can do it.”After saying that, Xiao Zhang continued, “Everyone says that miss ye is chasing after the CEO. I don’t think that’s the case...” ”

“Could it be that our fifth master is chasing after her?”

“Xiao Zhang nodded very seriously. “To be honest, if I didn’t see it with my own eyes, even I wouldn’t dare to believe it myself.” ”

“Stop joking! Does our fifth master need to chase after her?”

A man like Cen Shaoqing never lacked women.

“As long as he wanted to, with just a flick of his finger, a bunch of people would flock to him. ”

He needed to chase after her?

Wasn’t this a fantasy?

“”I saw it with my own eyes!”Xiao Zhang sat on the office chair and imitated ye Zao’s actions just now, “Miss Ye was just sitting there with her feet on the office desk. Master five was standing behind her with a coke in one hand and a dessert in the other! Serving Miss Ye was like serving the empress dowager, Old Buddha Ye!” ”

“You must have mistaken master five for Miss Ye.”

“”Yes, I must have mistaken him.” ”

“Seeing that everyone did not believe him, Xiao Zhang’s face turned pale with anxiety. The more he explained, the more confused he became. In the end, he simply stopped explaining. ”

...

The Ye family.

“These past few days, Old Lady Lin had been lying in bed, but she did not attract the attention of Lin Jincheng because of this. ”

Feng Qianhua came to visit Old Lady Lin with a bowl of health-preserving soup. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Old Lady Lin cried in front of Feng Qianhua, “Disaster! What a disaster! Ye Shu is a disaster! Ever since that day, Jin Cheng has not come to my house for five whole days! I heard that he is going to hold some family recognition banquet, right?” ”

“Feng Qianhua nodded, “Aunt Lin, since things have come to this point, it’s useless for you to be angry. No matter what, Brother Jin City is your child. Do you still want to be angry with your own child? “Now that the boat has sailed, since you can’t change anything, it’s better for you to accept it as soon as possible so that the distance between you and brother Jin city will not deepen.” ”

Old Lady Lin didn’t say anything.

“Feng Qianhua continued, “I say, not only do you have to accept it, but you also have to go out and invite the four brothers and sisters-in-law back. After all, family identification is a big deal! No matter what, you can’t embarrass the Lin family.” ”

The four brothers and sisters-in-law of the Lin family were not simple people.

Would they tolerate an uncultured sister-in-law and an idiot-like niece?

Feng Qianhua wanted everyone to see that.

“Other than her, no one else was worthy of Lin Jin Cheng. ”

“Hearing this, Old Lady Lin was enlightened. ”

Right!

Feng Qianhua was right.

“She and Lin Jin Cheng had the same mother-son relationship. Even if Lin Jin Cheng got married and had children, she was still the old lady of the Lin family. ”

No one could surpass her and climb onto her head!

Let alone that B * Tch Ye Shu.

“Seeing Old Lady Lin like this, the corners of Feng Qianhua’s lips curled up. She scooped out a bowl of soup and handed it to Old Lady Lin. “Aunt Lin, have some soup first.” ”

“”Qianhua, you’ve really worked hard these past few years.”Old Lady Lin Sighed softly. “This is all my fault. I gave birth to a disappointing son!”If Lin Jin Cheng had worked hard, the Lin family would not be like this. ”

“Feng Qianhua smiled and said, “It’s not your fault. It’s not brother Jincheng’s fault. Emotional matters can not be controlled.” ”

Old Mrs. Lin sighed softly again.

“If Lin Jincheng had married Feng Qianhua, it would have been great. ”

Unfortunately.

This child did not know how blessed he was.

“After drinking the soup, Feng Qianhua took a tissue to help old Mrs. Lin wipe her mouth. ”

Old Mrs. Cen was very touched.

“It was said that there was no filial son in front of a sick bed, but Feng Qianhua could come over and take care of her day by day for nineteen years. ”

“Aunt Zhang smiled and said, “Old Mrs. Cen, if people who don’t know you see this, they will think that you and Miss Qianhua are mother and daughter.” ”
