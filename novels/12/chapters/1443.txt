“Chapter 1444: 308: Strong and merciless, smacking professor Yue in the face! 2”

Translator: 549690339

“”This time, professor Yue’s efforts were for naught. He originally wanted to threaten Lord fifth, but he didn’t expect that not only did he not threaten Lord fifth, he even lost his wife and his soldiers!” ”

“”The most unlucky ones should be those members of zone B. They originally thought that they were the core members of Zone B, the kind that couldn’t be replaced. Who knew that they would be replaced at any moment!” ”

“Things haven’t come to the end yet. Let’s wait and see! What if there’s still room for change? This core position isn’t something that can be replaced just because it can be replaced.”

The crowd continued to discuss.

Tang Xue immediately picked up her phone and called Professor Yue.

“Professor Yue was sitting at home, waiting for Cen Shaoqing to come and apologize. ”

“However, he didn’t see Cen Shaoqing even when it was half past nine. ”

“Wan Sheng frowned. “Hongyan, I told you long ago that you couldn’t threaten Master Five, but you didn’t listen! What Now?” ”

Professor Yue said that Cen Shaoqing would definitely come and apologize before 8 o’clock.

What time was it now?

“Cen Shaoqing, even Cen Shaoqing’s special assistant, Zhou Yue, didn’t show up. ”

“Professor Yue’s expression was a little ugly, but he still insisted. “He will come! Master five will definitely come!” ”

Unless Cen Shaoqing wanted to give up the entire B district.

“Otherwise, Cen Shaoqing would definitely come and beg her. ”

“”It’s already 9:30,”wan sheng continued, “Hongyan! “Just listen to me and bring everyone to apologize to master five. For the sake of your many years of service to the base, he definitely won’t fuss over those things with you. Otherwise, the gains will not make up for the losses!” ”

“If professor Yue stopped now, he could still preserve his retirement reputation. ”

“At this moment, a series of phone ringtones suddenly rang in the air. ”

Was It Cen Shaoqing Calling?

Cen Shaoqing was CEN fifth master. It was normal for him to be unable to lower himself to call her.

“Therefore, this phone call was definitely CEN Shaoqing calling! ”

“Professor Yue looked at Wan Sheng. “Look, isn’t he already here? Quickly go and get my phone!” ”

“Wan Sheng glanced at her and didn’t say anything more. He walked over to the phone and said as he walked, “If master five gives you a way out later, don’t take advantage of him. If you have to let him off, let him off! Why do you have to do this?” ”

“Don’t meddle in my affairs!”It was professor Yue’s.

Wan Sheng shook his head helplessly. He took the phone and was stunned.

This...

It was not a call from master five.

Wan Sheng’s expression changed. He handed the phone to Professor Yue.

“Professor Yue took the phone. When he saw Tang Xue’s name on the screen, he was also stunned. ”

Why wasn’t it Cen Shaoqing?

Could it be that Cen Shaoqing wanted Tang Xue to be a lobbyist?

“Professor Yue narrowed his eyes. He thought for a moment before he answered, “Hello.” ”

“”Professor Yue, it’s Tang Xue. Something Big has happened!” ”

“What happened?”Professor Yue asked.

“Tang Xue looked around the base. “It’s not convenient to talk over the phone. Why Don’t we meet up? Professor Yue, I’ll wait for you at the coffee shop downstairs.” ”

“”Sure,”professor Yue said. ”

“After hanging up the phone, professor Yue felt a little strange. ”

“What kind of major incident couldn’t be explained clearly on the phone, and she had to talk about it in person? ”

“After thinking about it, professor Yue felt that Tang Xue must have been entrusted by Cen Shaoqing. ”

“If it weren’t for Cen Shaoqing, Tang Xue wouldn’t be like this. ”

“Seeing her like this, Wan Sheng asked, “What did little Tang look for you for?” ”

“What else could she look for me for? It must be fifth master who entrusted her to look for me!”

Wan Shengdu was a little speechless. “You! You’re so stubborn!”

“Professor Yue said, “Master five was the one who asked Xiaoxue to look for me!”She had to be stubborn about such a small matter. ”

“Because they were close, when Professor Yue arrived at the cafe downstairs, Tang Xue had not arrived yet. ”

“About 15 minutes later, Tang Xue rushed over. ”

“Professor Yue ordered a cup of coffee for Tang Xue and asked despite knowing the answer, “Xiaoxue, why are you in such a hurry to look for me?” ”

“Tang Xue was not in the mood to drink coffee now. She continued, “Professor Yue, something happened!” ”

“Something happened?”Professor Yue frowned. “What happened?”

“Tang Xue continued, “The scientific research room in Area B has returned to normal.” ”

“”What?”Professor Yue said in surprise, “It’s, it’s Sun Yu?” ”

“Sun Yu was professor Yue’s disciple. Ever since she joined the base, she had been following her. Logically speaking, Sun Yu should not have been sentenced to death. ”

“If Sun Yu would betray her, she would not have mobilized everyone to strike! ”

“”It’s not Sun Yu!”Tang Xue continued, “It’s member a 2! Member a 2 has replaced all the members of the original research room.” ”
