“Therefore, she still had to wait. ”

She had to wait until Saturday to see boss Wang’s attitude.

“When Li Hang returned home, he saw Li da long cutting fruits. ”

“Li Da Long seemed to be in a good mood. “Hang Hang, you’re back.” ” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Dad.”

“”Hang Hang, do you have a boyfriend?”Li Da Long continued to ask. ”

“”No.”Li hang shook his head. “Dad, why would you suddenly ask that?” ”

Li Da Long took out his phone. “Look at your moments.”

“Li hang said, “Oh, I’m going with my friend.” ”

“After saying that, Li hang continued, “She’s a woman. Dad, don’t make wild guesses. Oh right, didn’t you say that you were going to see Auntie Yi today? How was it?” ”

“The time was not ripe yet, so they could not let Li da long know about boss Wang’s existence. ”

What if Li Da Long knew and thought that he was sabotaging it?

Then wouldn’t it be a futile effort?

“Li Da long smiled and said, “The impression is still okay, but I don’t know how his temper is. So I plan to get in touch with him more.” ”

“Actually, Li Da Long’s requirements were not high. As long as he could live at home, it would be enough. ”

Li hang nodded. “Congratulations.”

“”This child.”Li da long continued, “What about your mother? How has she been recently?” ”

Li hang shook his head and denied that he had met Zhou Cui Hua recently. “I’m not too sure either.”

“Hearing such an answer, Li Da Long was somewhat gratified. ”

“After all, his daughter was on his side. ”

“Li da long continued, “Hang Hang, the matter between your mother and I is between her and me. After all, she is your mother. She is the one who gave birth to you and raised you. No matter what happens between adults, your mother will always be your mother. You Can’t just ignore your mother because of a moment of anger.” ”

Li hang frowned slightly. “But she betrayed you!”

These words were too touching.

Li Da Long’s eyes turned hot. “Good child.”

“At this point.., li da long continued, “Father still said the same thing. Mother will always be mother. Although your mother has betrayed her marriage, she still has nothing to say to you. Hang Hang Hang, the most important thing in life is filial piety. Can’t you not even recognize your mother?” ”

“Although Li Da Long did not have much culture, he was reasonable. ”

The matter between him and Zhou Cui Hua should not involve the child.

“Okay.”Li hang nodded.

“Li da long continued, “Hang, eat some of this fruit. I picked it from the shed in the afternoon. It’s sweet.” ”

Li Hang picked up a piece and tasted it. “It’s really sweet.”

“Seeing that his daughter liked it, Li Da Long was even happier. ”

“Soon, it was Saturday. ”

Li hang made some preparations and arrived at Zhou Cuihua’s rented place.

“Today, Zhou Cuihua was dressed like a rich lady. ”

She was very elegant.

“In addition, she was already quite good-looking. When she dressed up like this, she looked like a real lady. ”

“”Mom, should we go alone, or will uncle Wang come to pick us up?” ”

Going alone and having someone pick us up were two completely different concepts.

“Zhou cuihua said, “He didn’t say. Did you drive here?” ”

“Yes.”Li hang nodded.

“Zhou cuihua said, “Then let’s go alone.” ”

“Hearing that, Li Hang knitted his brows without leaving a trace ”

“He didn’t say he was coming to pick you up?”

“Zhou cuihua shook her head and said with a smile, “It’s convenient now with the navigation! There’s no need for anyone to pick you up.” ”

“”Although that’s what they say, that’s not the reason!”Li hang continued, “It’s your first time going to the Wang family. If he values you enough, he should take the initiative to come and pick you up, and not let you go by yourself!” ”

“Zhou cuihua said nonchalantly, “Today is your grandma Wang’s birthday. Your Uncle Wang is busy, so there are some things that can’t be considered.” ”

The most important thing between husband and wife was to tolerate each other.

Zhou Cuihua didn’t care about such things.

She just needed to make sure that boss Wang liked her.

“After saying that, Zhou cuihua continued, “Hang Hang, have you thought about what I asked you to think about? When will you move your household registration out from your father’s Place?” ”

“Li hang said, “Mom, don’t be anxious. Let me think about it again.” ”

“”What else is there to think about?”Zhou cuihua continued, “I’ve never met anyone who doesn’t want to be a rich young lady! Hang Hang, let me tell you. If you don’t come, Don’t blame me and your uncle Wang for having another younger brother and sister.” ”

“Li hang smiled and said, “Mom, it’s just a matter of time, and you’re already thinking about such a distant problem?” ”

Zhou cuihua had already started to think about the future before she even had a chance to make a name for herself!

She was thinking too simply.
