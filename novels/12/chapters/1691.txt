“”Then let’s go to the hospital for a check-up after the exam.”The doctor continued, “Food poisoning doesn’t disappear. Although you seem to be fine now, many of the toxins are late-stage outbreaks.” ”

“Okay.”Lin Sha nodded.

“Then sign this document first.”The doctor took out a disclaimer.

Lin Sha lowered her head and signed.

“After the ambulance left, Ye Zhuo drove Lin Sha to the examination room. ”

“Five minutes later, the car stopped at the entrance of the examination room. ”

“Ye Zhuo handed Lin Sha a small bottle. “Here are some heart-cleansing pills. If you feel unwell later, take one of these.” ”

“Okay.”Lin Sha took the bottle. “I’ll go in first.”

“”Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded. “By the way, what time did you guys leave the restaurant?” ”

Lin Sha Thought for a moment. “Around 12:05.”

“Got it.”

“After Lin Sha left, Ye Zhuo took out his computer from the car and started to check the surveillance cameras. ”

“When he checked the surveillance cameras of the restaurant, Ye Zhuo was surprised to find that the surveillance cameras of the restaurant had been deleted between 11:50 and 12:00. ”

Ye Zao had a hunch that the cause of Lin Sha’s poisoning must be within this period of time.

“As long as the surveillance was restored, he would be able to find the cause. ”

Ye Zao hacked into the surveillance system and tried to recover the ten minutes that had disappeared. He found that the person who hacked the surveillance was also an expert.

The other party’s IP was displayed overseas.

“However, after breaking through the firewall, ye Zao unexpectedly found that the other party’s IP address was in a middle school. ”

In other words... This person was either a teacher or a student!

“If it had been anyone else, this deleted surveillance footage might never have been recovered. ”

But his opponent was ye Zao after all.

“Unfortunately, when ye Zao was halfway through recovering, his laptop ran out of battery and the rest could only be restored after he returned to the hotel. ”

Five o’clock in the afternoon.

The Math exam was over.

Lin Sha walked out of the exam room.

“At the same time, Zou Feifei also walked out of the exam room. ”

“Seeing Lin Sha’s back, Zou Feifei thought he was hallucinating. ”

Lin Sha?

“Didn’t something happen to Lin Sha? At this time, Lin Sha should be lying in the hospital! Why was she in the exam room? ”

She had seen Lin Sha Drink the drink with her own eyes.

How could there be no problem with Lin Sha?

What was going on?

“Zou Feifei’s heart skipped a beat and he immediately chased after her, “Sha Sha!” ”

“Lin Sha turned around and smiled, “Feifei.” ”

It was Lin Sha Sha.

It really was Lin Sha.

She was not mistaken.

“Zou Feifei tried his best to calm himself down and smiled, “Sha Sha, you’re fine! When I called you back then, you didn’t pick up. When I knocked on the door, you didn’t respond. I thought something happened to you!” ”

“Lin Sha said, “Something did happen, but it should be fine now.” ”

“What happened to you back then?”Zou Feifei asked.

“Lin Sha said, “120 came over and said that I had food poisoning. By the way, Feifei, you ate with us at noon. Did you have any adverse reactions?” ”

“No.”Zou feifei shook his head.

“That’s strange.”

“Zou feifei continued, “Did you call the police?” ”

Lin Sha nodded. “My Friend has already filed a report at the Police Station!”

“”OH.”Zou Feifei narrowed his eyes. He looked calm on the surface, but he was a little flustered inside. After all, she was the one who had drugged him. ”

“If they found out, what would she do? ”

It was fine.

She had already asked the hacker to delete the surveillance cameras. There were no surveillance cameras and no witnesses. who could prove that she had drugged him.

“Thinking of this, Zou Feifei felt much better. ”

The two of them walked out of the door and indeed saw ye Zao standing outside. There were two police officers with ye Zao.

“”Zao Zao!”Lin Sha jogged over. “Hello, police officer.” ”

“Lin Sha?”

“”Yes.”Lin Sha nodded. “This is Zou Feifei, who had lunch with us at noon. He is also this year’s examinee.” ” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“The police officer continued, “Please follow us to the police station to make a statement.” ”

Zou feifei creased his brows.

Let Her go too?

“Lin Sha turned to look at Zou Feifei. “Feifei, is it convenient for you?” ”

“Yes.”Zou feifei nodded.

“If she said that it was inconvenient at this time, wouldn’t she have a guilty conscience? ”

“Then let’s go.”

The three of them got into the police car together.

“At this moment, right at the end of the examination, there were many examinees and parents gathered at the school gate. When they saw the three of them get into the police car, everyone was somewhat curious. ”
