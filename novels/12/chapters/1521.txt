Translator: 549690339

“Niu Hulu, Year 12 Blizzard: [ Daddy, say something! All of you, be quiet, don’t scare daddy! ] ”

“Ye Zhuo looked at everyone who was talking to each other. His eyes were curved, and he sent a message: [ Hello, everyone, I am YC. ] ”

“[ hello, Daddy, I Am Your Good Big Son, true water without fragrance! ] ”

[ get lost! I Am Daddy’s Good Big Son! ]

[ I’m clearly your father’s good big son! ]

[ no one can snatch my father’s good big son’s position! ]

“[ YC Daddy, don’t listen to their nonsense, I’m your only good big son! ] ”

A Spy who was hiding in the group to gather information was dumbfounded.

“He had seen all kinds of situations, but he had never seen anyone who was fighting to be someone else’s good big son! ” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

What kind of magic did this YC have? To make so many scientific researchers willingly call her father?

“The undercover agent had thought that this group was filled with people at the bottom of society who had nothing to do, but he was puzzled that it was a troll hired by YC. One day, he unintentionally opened an ID account, and... He found that the other party’s name actually appeared on the scientific research rankings... ”

“Then, he carefully investigated the information of every member in the group. In the end, he was surprised to find that even an unremarkable member was a well-known person on the International Science and Technology website! ”

Only then did he believe that YC’s current success did not depend on marketing.

...

On the other side.

Country C.

“Afraid that ye Zao would go back on his word, Dr. Cara pulled the five professors from abroad to a meeting to discuss countermeasures together. He could not let the Ducks that had landed in his mouth fly away just like that! ”

“If they could divide up the power of China’s scientific research community, it would be something that would go down in history for the scientific research community. ”

That was the CEN group’s base!

“While the meeting was in progress, the sound of a sensor came from outside the door. ”

Dr. Cara pressed the switch and opened the sensor door.

An assistant wearing an anti-radiation isolation suit jogged in from outside. “Doctor!”

“What’s Wrong?”Dr. Cara turned around.

“The assistant held the tablet. “Doctor, YC has responded!” ”

“Hearing that, the other five professors at the conference table immediately stood up and asked impatiently, “What did YC say?” ”

“The assistant opened the contents of the tablet and said, “YC said that she doesn’t agree to our proposed agreement.” ”

She doesn’t agree!

She actually doesn’t agree.

Professor Cara narrowed his eyes. It seemed that this YC was a little smarter than he had imagined. She actually knew that such a bet agreement couldn’t be signed.

“Tina frowned and looked at Cara. “Professor, if she doesn’t agree, then won’t our plan be ruined?” ”

“CARA’s expression was also a little ugly. She had thought that she could take down the CEN’s research base in one fell swoop, but she didn’t expect YC to suddenly get the hang of it. ”

“Gadomi said, “It must be those people from the CEN research base who don’t agree! It seems that this matter is going to be a little tricky!” ”

It was not enough to use this tactic on Y. she had to use it on the CEN research base.

“Don’t act rashly yet.”Cara raised her hand. “Find someone to bring up the tempo on the Internet First!”

“YC had caused a stir in the bet agreement. Previously, they had agreed to sign the BET agreement. Now, they suddenly went back on their word. Who knew how many people were waiting to watch the Show! ”

[ I knew YC wouldn’t dare! ]

[ YC is a coward. ]

[ signing and not signing at the same time. HOW BORING! ]

“The administrators, hei zi and big hairy, looked at the comments on the international internet and smiled at each other. ”

“Are you going to post it now?”Big hairy looked at Hei Zi.

Hei Zi nodded. “Yes!”

“Okay.”Big Hairy operated the mouse and posted ye Zao’s statement.

That’s right.

Ye Zao suddenly joined the family group to support the people who supported them.

She didn’t want a group of people who liked and supported her to fall in love with loneliness.

Anyone who liked and supported her would be rewarded in the end.

[ this is the gambling agreement that our father drew up. Do you dare to sign it? ][ picture/][ picture/][ picture/][ picture/]

“This new gambling agreement was a total of five pages. It was logical and clear. It clearly stated that if the aircraft carrier project was successful.., the management rights of the six countries’scientific research bases, including country C, Country G, Country P, Japan, and Country L, would all belong to China. ”

“Moreover, these six countries would have to publish international newspapers and apologize to China! ”

“Finally, they would have to compensate a huge sum of money! ”

“Of course, if the aircraft carrier project was not completed within the stipulated time, Ye Zao’s side would also pay the same price! ”
