“Chapter 1643: 345: Trash, Tang Xue is expelled from the base. 4”

Translator: 549690339

Ye Zhuo signaled with his eyes for his assistant to deliver the agreement to Dr. Cara.

“Dr. Cara’s face turned a little pale when he saw the agreement, and the other five people beside him also looked very pale.”

They had originally come to recover the Cen’s base in Hua.

But they didn’t expect...

They failed to steal the chicken and instead gave away their own country’s scientific research base.

The original bet agreement was notarized at the International Notary Office.

“In order to prevent China from reneging on the bet, they even publicized this matter internationally and made it known to everyone. Who knew that in the end, it would turn out to be a self-inflicted wound, shooting themselves in the foot.”

They regretted it!

“If they had known that ye Zao could really build a lightspeed aircraft carrier, they definitely would not have done that.”

“But now, what was the use of regretting it?”

“In front of the people of the world, they could only sign the agreement.”

“Dr. Cara took the pen from his assistant, his hands shaking!”

“According to the bet agreement, they had lost not only the right to use the bases of various countries, but also a huge amount of compensation.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

They had thought that the loser this time would definitely be China.

Who would have thought that China would turn the tables?

“The leaders of the other countries were not much better than Dr. Cara, and their expressions were very ugly.”

After signing the papers.

“Ye Zhuo slowly walked over, and his eyes were as clear as ever. “Thank you, Dr. Cara, and everyone for your cooperation. Three days later, we will send a commissioner to complete the handover of the management rights of the bases.””

“Dr. Cara was speechless. He could only smile and say, “It’s our duty to accept our loss!””

“After saying that, Dr. Cara cupped his hands to ye Zao and said, “I haven’t congratulated Dr. YC on successfully landing on Neptune!””

“”Thank you,”ye Zao said in a low voice. “It’s all thanks to your support. Without your support, I don’t think the aircraft carrier project would have been so successful.””

Dr. Cara looked at the young girl standing in front of him. He couldn’t tell what expression he had in his eyes.

“But for a moment, he recalled the first time he saw ye Zao.”

“At that time, he just felt that this young girl was very different from other girls her age. She had a calmness and stability that other girls her age didn’t have.”

“But Dr. Cara never thought that one day, this girl would successfully build an aircraft carrier that was faster than the speed of light.”

That was the speed of light!

“Two hundred countries from all over the world had joined hands and failed in the end. However, this little girl was only in her early twenties!”

How did she do it?

“If he had not seen it with his own eyes, Dr. Cara would never have believed that it was real!”

“An hour later, the aircraft carrier launch ceremony ended successfully.”

“After it ended, all the major media reporters swarmed over. They all wanted to interview ye Zao and the few people who had successfully landed on Neptune to get first-hand news.”

“Ye Zao was too lazy to deal with all this, so he asked the river, Lake, and sea brothers, as well as Tang Mi and Yu Zi, to appear on camera.”

“On the other hand, Dr. Warne and Dr. Millet went to study the samples they had brought back from Neptune.”

In the office.

Cen Shaoqing turned to look at special assistant Li. “Go and call Tang Xue Over.”

Special Assistant Li nodded. “Okay.”

“However, when Tang Xue saw Special Assistant Li, she panicked.”

“”Th-special assistant Li, why are you here?””

“Special Assistant Li had seen everything Tang Xue had done during this period of time. To be honest, he looked down on Tang Xue.”

“If someone like Tang Xue was in wartime, she would definitely be a traitor.”

“Fifth master wants you to go over.”

Tang Xue gulped. “Did fifth master say what it was about?”

“”I’m not too sure either. You’ll know once you get there,”said special assistant Li.”

Tang Xue put down the document in her hand and followed special assistant Li’s footsteps. She prayed to God all the way.

She prayed that Cen Shaoqing would not pursue her responsibility.

“Old Master Tang was a benefactor to the base. Moreover, Old Master Tang had left because of the base. As long as Cen Shaoqing was a person who cared about favors, he would not make things difficult for her.”

“When she thought of Old Master Tang, Tang Xue felt much better.”

“Very soon, she arrived at Cen Shaoqing’s office.”

“Cen Shaoqing sat in front of his desk with a string of Buddhist beads in his hand. Although he didn’t say anything and his sitting posture was very casual, Tang Xue felt that she couldn’t breathe. It was very oppressive.”

“After a while, Tang Xue licked her lips and walked in front of Cen Shaoqing. “Fifth master, you were looking for me.””

“Cen Shaoqing looked up slightly. “Tang Xue, you don’t have to come tomorrow.””

“Tang Xue’s face turned pale. “Fifth Master, why?””
