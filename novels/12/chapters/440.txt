“Four well-known professors and two college presidents suddenly visited the dormitory building, causing a sensation in the entire building. They all stretched their heads out and looked outside. ” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Someone even took a photo and posted it on the forum.

It was already past nine o’clock in the evening.

“The night was hazy, so the photo was taken very vaguely. However, it could be clearly seen that the person who was surrounded by the professors and the two presidents was a girl. She was like a star worshipping the Moon. ”

She was very tall.

“Although her face could not be seen clearly, one could already feel that powerful aura. ”

It was cold and chilly.

She stood out among the professors.

“DAMN! This year’s freshman is a Little Shameless!”

“What’s the background of this freshman?”

“”I heard that this freshman is especially perverted. She got a full score in the Comprehensive Science exam! She only got one point deducted from the national paper, but she still forgot to write one question!” ”

“Really?”

“80% credibility!”

In the dormitory.

“Ever since ye Zao left, Feng Xianxian’s expression was extremely ugly. ”

“Ever since she was young, she had never lost such a person! ”

“She was filled with joy as she opened the door, but in the end, the other party was not looking for her at all! ”

“Instead, they were looking for ye Zao, who was inferior to her in everything! ”

“Bai Xiaoman stood at the side, her eyes red as she apologized to Feng Xianxian, “Qianqian, I’m sorry. I didn’t know things would turn out like this. You’re so outstanding, you’re the top scorer in the capital! Ye Zao can’t even compare to a single strand of your hair. Those professors must be blind!” ”

“It was fine if Bai Xiaoman didn’t speak, but once Bai Xiaoman spoke, Feng Qianqian became even angrier! ”

“If Bai Xiaoman hadn’t intentionally misled her, she wouldn’t have lost so much face. ”

“”Did you do it on purpose? You wanted to see me make a fool of myself, didn’t you?”Feng Xianxian raised her head and looked at Bai Xiaoman. ”

“Bai Xiaoman shook her head aggrievedly. “Xianxian, I didn’t do it on purpose! I really didn’t do it on purpose! You’re the most outstanding person in our dormitory. I really didn’t expect those professors to come to ye Zao!” ”

“”Xianxian, please forgive me!” ”

“After saying that, Bai Xiaoman continued, “Ye Zao! It’s ye Zao! It’s all ye Zao’s fault! Ye Zao clearly knew that those professors came to look for her, but she pretended to not know anything! She wanted to see you make a fool of yourself on Purpose!” ”

“Hearing this, Feng Xianxian narrowed her eyes. ”

That’s right.

Why didn’t she think of this?

All of this was ye Zao’s fault!

“When the professors came to look for ye Zao, it was impossible that ye Zao did not hear anything beforehand, but ye Zao did not say anything. ”

“Ye Zao, that country bumpkin, was doing it on purpose! ”

Just wait.

She had to make ye Zao pay the price.

“Feng Xianxian bit her lip, and the sinister look in her eyes was about to come out. ”

Li Yueyue came out of the bathroom after taking a shower. She subconsciously felt that the atmosphere in the dormitory was not quite right.

But she did not say anything. She directly climbed onto the bed and started playing games.

“As long as Ye Zhuo was not in the dormitory, she basically did not say much. ”

“Because Li Yueyue felt that apart from her and ye Zhuo, Feng Xianxian and Bai Xiaoman were not quite normal. ”

It was strange.

“An hour later, ye Zao returned from outside. ”

“Seeing ye Zao return, Li Yueyue said curiously, “Ye Zao, you’re back!” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Li Yueyue continued, “I want to eat something tonight. Shall we order takeout? There will be a discount if we order two portions of this!” ”

“Sure! What do you want to eat?”

“Li Yueyue said in surprise, “Aren’t you afraid that you’ll gain weight if you eat at night?” ”

“”I’m not afraid,”ye Zhuo continued, “I want to eat spicy hot pot.” ”

Li Yueyue really didn’t expect that a fairy like ye Zhuo would actually like to eat spicy hot pot!

This was too down-to-earth!

“”I want to eat spicy hot pot too!”Li Yueyue said excitedly, “Ye Zhuo, I didn’t expect us to be so fated!” ”

Feng Xianxian was lying on the bed applying a facial mask.

“Hearing ye Zao and Li Yueyue talking about spicy hotpot, her stomach churned and she felt like she was going to throw up. ”

“Sure enough, they were two country bumpkins who came out of a poor mountain. ”

They actually ate cheap and unhygienic junk food like spicy hotpot!

“Feng Xianxian pressed the facial mask and said, “Xiaoman.” ”

“”What’s wrong, Xianxian?” ”

“Feng Xianxian continued, “I still have two coupons for a three-star Michelin restaurant here. Tomorrow night, you can accompany me to eat! It’s my treat!” ”

Feng Xianxian said casually.

Bai Xiaoman was very surprised when she heard that.

That was a three-star Michelin restaurant!

“A three-star Michelin restaurant not only had a per capita consumption of over 10,000 yuan, but it also only received pre-booked customers. ”

“Bai Xiaoman had only been to one-star restaurants, not even two-star or three-star restaurants. ”
