“If it weren’t for the fact that the entire grassland was covered in thick snow, it would easily cause a fire. ”

Ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing were sitting southwest of the bonfire.

“The light from the fire reflected on her eyebrows, making her already exquisite eyebrows appear even more alluring. ”

Ye Zhuo leaned on his shoulder and looked up at the sky. “I suddenly found that the starry sky on the grassland is so beautiful.”

“Different from the noisy city, the starry sky on the prairie was even clearer and brighter. ”

It made one instantly return to the night of the 70s and 80s.

Cen Shaoqing slightly raised his eyes.

“The stars in the sky were bright, and in the dark night, mysterious lights flickered. ”

It was very different from observing the stars at a close distance on an aircraft carrier.

“At this moment, with a loved one by his side, even the stars seemed to have become beautiful! ”

“Do you know which is Altair Star and Vega Star?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“I know.”Ye Zao’s Red Lips parted slightly. “Those three stars are Altair and their children. The star across the Milky Way is Vega.”

“At this moment, Li Yueyue’s voice sounded in the air. “Zao Zao, CEN Fifth Master.” ”

“Ye Zao turned around and saw Li Yueyue. “Yueyue, you’re here.” ”

“Li yueyue nodded and continued, “Zao Zao, let me introduce you. This is my cousin, Li Shuyi. Cousin, this is Miss Ye. This is Miss Ye’s boyfriend, Fifth Master Cen.” ”

“Ye Zao greeted politely, “Miss Li.” ”

Miss Li?

Ye Zao actually addressed her as Miss Li!

“Ye Zao and Li Yueyue were classmates, and she was Li Yueyue’s cousin. According to seniority, Ye Zao should also address her as cousin. ”

He was really too unruly.

He lacked family education!

She wondered how fifth master Cen had taken a fancy to such a girl.

“Li Shuyi smiled and said gently, “Hello, Miss Ye. Hello, Fifth Master Cen.” ”

“After saying that, she extended her hand to the two of them. “I’m Li Shuyi. My mother is from C Nation, and my father is from China. I grew up in C Nation. The two of you can call me by my English name, Ashley. It’s nice to meet you both.” ”

Ye Zhuo reached out to shake her hand.

Li Shuyi extended her hand towards Cen Shaoqing. “CEN Fifth Master.”

“Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly and glanced at Li Shuyi, his expression unmoving. ”

“Li Shuyi’s hand froze in mid-air, feeling a little awkward. ”

“A moment later, Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted slightly. “I have mysophobia.” ”

Mysophobia!

“These four words were light and airy, but it was more uncomfortable than directly giving them to Li Shuyi. ”

She was not trash!

“Cen Shaoqing was obsessed with cleanliness, what did it have to do with shaking hands? ”

“Li Shuyi’s face alternated between red and white, and she was very uncomfortable. ”

Li Yueyue almost laughed out loud.

But she still tried very hard to hold it in.

“Ever since she met Li Shuyi, Li Shuyi had always had a condescending attitude, as if no one was better than her. ”

“This time, she was finally defeated. ”

Li Yueyue could not wait to set off firecrackers to celebrate.

Li Shuyi retracted her hand awkwardly. “I’m sorry.”

“She was a mixed-race beauty, and there were at least a hundred suitors around her. When had she ever been looked down upon by a man? ”

Yes.

She admitted that ye Zao beside Cen Shaoqing was indeed very beautiful.

But she was a mixed-race beauty after all.

Did Ye Zao have mixed-race blood?

Did Ye Zao Have Blue Eyes?

No!

Ye Zao didn’t have any of these.

“After a while, Li Shuyi continued, “Miss Ye, tonight is the new year on our grassland. You two must play to your heart’s content.” ”

“Definitely.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Li Shuyi took out her phone and continued, “Miss Ye, shall we add her on wechat?” ”

“”Her phone is out of battery,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

Her phone was out of battery?

“Hearing this, Li Yueyue felt embarrassed for Li Shuyi. ”

“If she were Li Shuyi, she would just find a hole to hide in. ”

“Initially, when Fang yinyue told her about Li Shuyi’s intentions, Li Yueyue was still in disbelief. ”

“This was because although the Li Shuyi she knew was arrogant and a little arrogant, she was definitely not the kind of person who had no bottom line. ” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Looking at it now.

It was all because she did not know Li Shuyi well enough.

“Cen Shaoqing had already rejected her, but she still stuck to him like this. It was embarrassing. ”

Embarrassing!

“Li Yueyue continued, “By the way, cousin, I remember that second aunt told you to go back and get your things. Let’s go back first.” ”

Li Shuyi was stunned for a moment.

“Li Yueyue looked at ye Zao and continued, “Zao Zao, I wish you and fifth master a good time. My cousin and I will go back first.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

Li Yueyue pulled Li Shuyi back.

“A few minutes later, Li Shuyi felt that something was wrong. “Yueyue, did you remember wrongly? My mother didn’t let me go back!” ”
