Chapter 193: 088: The Boss is online, I’ve finally found her! 6

Seeing that there were many people using NIU Hulu as the prefix on the website forum, Mu yourong also used Niu Hulu as the prefix.

Niu Hulu · yr.

This way, not only could she gain the boss’s favor, but she could also stand out from the crowd of Niu Hulu’s ids.

It was simply the best of both worlds!

Mu Yourong also set up her profile picture as a close-up of a soft and beautiful hand, adding filters and beauty, allowing people to automatically imagine that the other party was a peerless beauty. The background information specifically indicated that she was 19 years old and single.

Generally, men liked beautiful women.

Although the system could not find out if Niu Hulu YC was a man or a woman.

But there were so many people on the forum who called him father, so Niu Hulu YC was definitely a geek. For him to be able to reach the same position as Dr. Warne, it meant that he was not young. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

It was estimated that he was over forty years old.

Men of all ages loved beautiful women.

Especially on this technology website that lacked women.

Mu Yourong had just asked the system to check, and this website only had one-tenth of women.

And there were no women with outstanding results.

......

The rarer something was, the more valuable it was.

She simply stood out from the crowd.

Mu Yourong slightly curved her lips. She was waiting for the day when Dr. Warne and Nuhuru YC would come to look for her.

...

After school at night.

Ye Zhuo, an Lizi, and Zhao Pingting walked out of the school gate together.

Just as the three of them walked out of the gate, a man in a black suit walked over. The golden setting sun covered his face with a mysterious veil. Although his face could not be seen clearly, the extraordinary aura around him.., made it difficult to ignore him.

“Miss Ye.”

The man walked straight to Ye Zao’s side and stopped.

Ye Zao looked up and saw a cold face reflected in her eyes. There seemed to be some hostility in her eyes.

It was none other than song Shiyu.

Ye Zao smiled slightly. “Mr. Song.”

An Lizi and Zhao Pingting, who were beside ye Zao, were both stunned.

This man was obviously not easy to get along with. The two of them subconsciously took a step back from ye Zao.

Song Shiyu looked at an Lizi and Zhao Pingting, then his gaze fell on Ye Zao. “Miss Ye, may I have a word with you?”

Ye Zao turned around to look at an Lizi and Zhao Pingting, then nodded.

The two of them came to the waiting area, and song Shiyu explained the purpose of his visit.

Hearing this, Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Then I’ll go with Mr. Song. However, there’s something I want to say first.”

“Go ahead.”

Ye Zhuo continued, “Grandma song is already very old. I can only do my best. The rest can only be left to fate.”

“That’s only natural.”Song Shiyu nodded slightly. “Grandma is already old. As long as I can help her reduce the suffering of her illness, I’ll be eternally grateful.”

After agreeing with song Shiyu, Ye Zhuo went to greet an Lizi and Zhao Pingting before getting into song Shiyu’s car.

Mu Yourong stood not far away and watched everything.

She knew that ye Zao would definitely attract song Shiyu’s attention!

Just like that, song Shiyu had already begun to make his move.

Ye Zao was definitely the same as her back then, madly in love with Song Shiyu, this wolf in sheep’s clothing!

He began to dream of marrying into the song family.

In a few days’time.

Ye Zao would know that at this moment, she had already stepped into hell.

The person that song Shiyu had set his eyes on would not be able to escape!

She would die a miserable death!

Mu Yourong’s heart was extremely happy when she saw ye Zao’s miserable fate.

At this moment, song Shiyu suddenly turned around.

That pair of eagle-like eyes stared fiercely at her.

His eyes were filled with malice.

Mu Yourong’s face instantly turned pale. The fear from her previous life also followed, and her back was drenched in cold sweat.

In an instant.

Mu Yourong felt as if she had returned to that cage filled with the stench of blood.

Terrifying!

Too terrifying!

Mu Yourong’s entire body was trembling.

Fortunately, song Shiyu quickly withdrew his gaze and boarded the black car.

Seeing the black car disappear on the road ahead, Mu Yourong’s face gradually regained its color, and she fled the place as if she was fleeing.

The car sped along the road.

The speed of the car was very fast, and it did not take long for them to arrive at the song family’s old residence.

Old Madam song was lying on her bed.

Although the weather had gradually warmed up, old madam song was still covered with a thick blanket. Moreover, the room was still warm.

“Zha Zha is here.”

“Grandmother song.”Ye Zha walked over with a smile.

“Zha Zha, I’ve troubled you to make a trip.”Old Madam Song grabbed ye Zha’s hand.

“Should be, I take your pulse first.”
