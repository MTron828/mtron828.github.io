Translator: 549690339

Lin Qingfan and Wu Mei had been married for more than 30 years and had never blushed.

Wu Mei was also a good wife and the two of them were very loving.

“At this time, Wu Mei was slapped by Old Lady Lin for no reason and this made Lin Qingfan very angry.”

“Seeing Lin Qingfan protect Wu Mei like this, Old Lady Lin was very upset.”

Apologize?

Lin Qingfan actually asked her mother-in-law to apologize to Wu Mei?

Could Wu Mei take it?

“Besides, wasn’t it common for an old woman to hit her daughter-in-law in the past?”

“Old Lady Lin pointed at Lin Qingxuan’s nose and scolded, “Unfilial Son! You unfilial son! I’m your mother! Your biological mother! Do you even think that you have a biological mother like me? I’m already more than 80 years old this year, and you want me to apologize to her? Lin Qing fan, aren’t you afraid of being struck by lightning?””

“Lin Qing fan furrowed his brows tightly. “No matter what, it’s wrong for you to hit someone!””

“Old Lady Lin continued, “If it’s wrong for me to hit someone, then what you two did was right? Boss! You’re the eldest son in the family. It’s fine if you don’t want to be on my side! But now, you’re actually allowing Qing Xuan to mess around with you! You’re still allowing that ambitious Xia Xiaoman to marry into our Lin family! You’re not helping Qing Xuan! You’re harming Qing Xuan!””

How could Lin Qing Xuan and Xia Xiaoman Be Happy Together?

Anyone with a discerning eye could see that Xia Xiaoman was only with Lin Qing Xuan because of money.

Only Lin Qing Xuan was foolishly deceived by Xia Xiaoman!

It was fine if Lin Qingxuan was stupid.

“Madam Lin never thought that Lin Qingfan, who she had always been proud of, would also be deceived by Xia Xiaoman. He even went beyond her and officiated the wedding for Lin Qingxuan!”

He simply didn’t have any rules at all!

“Elder brother as father, elder sister-in-law as mother, these words were indeed correct.”

But she was still alive!

She was still fine!

“As long as she was still in this world, Lin Qingfan and Wu Mei didn’t have the right to do this.”

Why should they?

“Lin Qingfan tried his best to calm himself down, “Mom, fourth sister-in-law is a good woman. Like Qing Xuan, she had a hard life in the first half of her life. I believe that they will be very happy when they get together! Don’t interfere in this matter! As parents, don’t they just want their children to be happy? Qing Xuan and fourth sister-in-law now have a very happy small family. Why are you doing this?””

A good woman?

Just Xia Xiao Man?

Old Lady Lin’s face was full of disdain.

“”Shut up!”Old Lady Lin continued, “Let me ask you, where is Qing Xuan Now?””

“Lin Qing fan looked at Old Lady Lin. “Mom, you’ve already caused Qing Xuan a lot of trouble! What else do you want? Do you have to make him lose this son of yours to be satisfied?””

Lin Qing fan knew that these words were very hurtful.

But he really couldn’t hold it in any longer.

“If madam Lin were to continue like this, Lin Qing Xuan would definitely not be able to take it.”

Madam Lin was stunned and her face instantly turned pale.

It turned out that Lin Qing Xuan wasn’t the only one blaming her.

Lin Qing fan also thought that what happened to Zhao Shu Ning was her fault.

The entire family felt that it was her fault!

But was it her fault?

Wasn’t her motive for doing this for Lin Qingxuan’s own good?

“”And Jin city’s family of four. Mom, if it wasn’t for you, would the four of them have been separated for so many years? Would Jin city lose a leg in a car accident? Would fifth brother and sister-in-law and little twelve have to suffer so much outside? Since so many things have happened, why can’t you reflect on yourself?””

Every single word of Lin Qingfan’s was heartbreaking.

Old Lady Lin almost lost her balance. The world was spinning around her.

“She never thought that after living for so long, she would actually become the ‘sinner’in her son’s eyes”

But did they ever think about it.

She was also a victim.

She was also kept in the dark by someone who had intentions.

No one understood her.

They were all blaming her. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Seeing that Old Lady Lin did not speak for a long time, Lin Qingfan supported Wu Mei and said, “Mom, think about it carefully. I’ll bring Wu Mei to treat her wound.””

Old Lady Lin’s slap was not light. It made Wu Mei’s mouth bleed.

“After saying that, Lin Qingfan left with Wu Mei.”

Old Lady Lin looked at the backs of Lin Qingfan and his wife and could not help but cry.

Lin Qingfan brought Wu Mei to the clinic.

The doctor prescribed some ointment to reduce the swelling.

“Lin Qingfan bent down to apply the ointment on Wu Mei. His eyes were filled with guilt. “I’m sorry, I made you suffer.””

“”It’s okay,”Wu Mei said with a smile. “Actually, it doesn’t hurt very much.””

“Although she was very angry at that time, at this moment, Wu Mei was no longer angry.”

She was very happy that Lin Qingfan did not compromise with Old Lady Lin Today.
