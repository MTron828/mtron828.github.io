Chapter 55: Surprise!

“Coming,” Ye Zhuo responded. She activated the automatic processing feature to continue running the data on the computer while she was away, then headed straight to the living room.

A man and a woman were sitting on the sofa in the living room.

They were Yi Tao and Chen Qiaoye.

Seeing Ye Zhuo come out, the two of them stood up excitedly. “Miss Ye!”

A month had passed, and Yi Tao had completely recovered. He still looked a little thin because he had been sick for too long.

He was most grateful to Ye Zhuo and Chen Qiaoye. If it weren’t for Ye Zhuo’s prescription and Chen Qiaoye’s insistence, he wouldn’t have been able to recover at all. Therefore, after he recovered, he didn’t even inform his parents and came over first thing to thank Ye Zhuo.

Knowing that Ye Zhuo was very busy during the day, they specially chose to come in the evening.

“Mr. and Mrs. Yi.” Ye Zhuo walked over with a smile.

At this moment, Yi Tao and Chen Qiaoye suddenly knelt in front of Ye Zhuo. This sudden scene stunned Ye Zhuo and Ye Shu.

“What are you doing? Get up quickly!”

Neither of the couple was willing to get up.

Yi Tao’s eyes were slightly red as he said, “It’s said that a man has gold under his knees, and therefore a man should never kneel to another person. However, Miss Ye, you have given me a second chance in life. Please accept this bow from us husband and wife!”

During the days when he was sick, Yi Tao never thought that he could get better. He even wrote a will. This feeling of escaping death could only be understood by those who had experienced it.

Moreover, although Ye Zhuo looked young, her elegant aristocratic temperament told a different story. Through this incident, Yi Tao could see Ye Zhuo’s true capabilities.

Although Yi Tao was many years older than Ye Zhuo, standing in front of Ye Zhuo, he felt that he was a junior, and there was no sense of dissonance.

Ye Zhuo smiled and pulled Yi Tao and Chen Qiaoye up. “This is not a feudal society, so there’s no need for you to kneel to me! Besides, as a doctor, treating patients and saving people is my responsibility!”

Chen Qiaoye took out a card and stuffed it into Ye Zhuo’s hand. “Miss Ye, this card is a token of our appreciation. Please accept it!”

Ye Zhuo didn’t argue and accepted the card generously.

The Yi family was a wealthy family in Yunjing. If she didn’t accept it, it would be easy for people to misunderstand that she had other intentions.

After chatting in the Ye family residence for a while, the couple suggested to leave. Ye Zhuo and Ye Shu sent them off to the entrance of the estate.

After getting into the car, Chen Qiaoye looked at Yi Tao. “Should we go to Mom and Dad’s place now? If they know that you’re fine, they’ll definitely be very happy.”

Yi Tao nodded. “Mom and dad have been worried about me for so many years. We have to give them a good surprise. How about this, let’s go back and make some preparations. We’ll call them tomorrow morning.”

“Okay!” Chen Qiaoye nodded, “Alright!”

The next morning, Chen Qiaoye gave a call to Yi Tao’s parents.

The person who answered the phone was the housekeeper.

In order to give the two old people a surprise, she did not say what it was. She merely said that something very serious had happened on her side and asked the old couple to come over.

The housekeeper had just hung up the phone when Li Qingyue walked over from the side, “Was that my cousin-in-law?”

“Yes.” The housekeeper nodded.

Li Qingyue narrowed her eyes, “Did Cousin-in-law say anything?” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

The housekeeper said very seriously, “Young madam said that something very serious has happened over there and needs Master and Madam to head there. I guess, maybe…” The rest was self-explanatory.

Currently, the most serious matter that worried the Yi family was Yi Tao’s illness.

Hearing this, Li Qingyue was overjoyed.

Something must have happened to Yi Tao!

The last time she had seen him, she could tell that Yi Tao would not last more than a month. Even so, she did not expect he would die just like that!

Soon, Li Qingyue’s face was covered with a layer of sadness. “Cousin is still so young. How can Uncle and Aunt bear to live on…”

Yi Tao was upright and outstanding!

What a pity!

The housekeeper sighed, “I’ll go upstairs to inform Master and Madam first.”

Li Qingyue nodded, quickly went back to her room, changed into a black dress, and removed the makeup on her face.

Yi Tao was dead.

She had to act sad.

When she went downstairs, Li Wenru Li and Yi Xuezheng, the middle-aged couple, had already gone downstairs.

Li Wenru lay against Yi Xuezheng’s body and cried incessantly, “Tao Tao! My poor child! It’s all that b*tch Chen Qiaoye’s fault! If she hadn’t given my son those nonsense pills, how could my son… Tao Tao… At such a young age!”

Although Yi Xuezheng’s mood seemed to be better than Li Wenru’s, his eyes were also red, “Wenru, don’t worry. I don’t think Qiaoye is that kind of person. Besides, she didn’t say anything about Tao Tao’s condition on the phone! Let’s go and take a look first. We can’t lose control hope yet.”

Li Qingyue walked over with a stiff voice, “Uncle, Aunt, please accept my condolences. Now that Cousin is gone, our family is relying on you guys. Cousin died unjustly! He must be waiting for you to avenge him!”

Hearing Li Qingyue’s words, Yi Xuezheng’s heart was crumbling bit by bit.

Could it be that… something bad had really happened to Yi Tao?

Li Wenru’s heart hurt so much that her facial features became twisted, “If something happens to Tao Tao, I will make that b*tch Chen Qiaoye pay with her life!”

Li Qingyue cried very sadly, “Not only Chen Qiaoye, but also Ye Zhuo! Ye Zhuo is a piece of trash, how could she have any medical skills! It was her and Chen Qiaoye who caused the death of Cousin! Uncle, Aunt, my cousin died unjustly, you guys have to avenge my cousin!”

Since Ye Zhuo was working on rebuilding her image right now, she was going to destroy Ye Zhuo and make sure the latter never, ever stood back up again.

With human lives at stake, Ye Zhuo would probably have to spend the rest of her life in prison.

Just because Mu Yourong didn’t concern herself with Ye Zhuo didn’t mean that Li Qingyue had similar views. Li Qingyue was a meticulous person, she wouldn’t let go of anyone who was a threat to their future.

With her and Mu Yourong around, Yunjing would be under their control sooner or later!

“Yes! And Zhuo Ye! These two b*tches! I want them to pay with their lives for my son’s death!”

The three of them hurried to the place where Yi Tao and Qiaoye Chen were staying.

The door of the villa was closed. There didn’t seem to be anyone around. The guards were gone. The bodyguards were also gone.

It was so quiet that it was a little suspicious.

This further confirmed Qingyue’s suspicions.

Qingyue turned back to look at Li Wenru and Yi Xuezheng. She said in a hoarse voice, “Uncle, Aunt, did Chen Qiaoye run away?”

“B*tch! That b*tch! Our Tao Tao’s love for her was in vain! To think that he wouldn’t marry anyone else but her! How dare she treat our Tao Tao this way! She must have taken away a lot of expensive things!”

Yi Xuezheng’s face was so gloomy that it turned black.

He had always thought that Chen Qiaoye was a good girl and a good daughter-in-law, so when Chen Qiaoye insisted on giving Yi Tao the medicine, he did not step in to stop her.

He thought that Chen Qiaoye would definitely not harm Yi Tao. It shocked him to the core to think that after so many years, he had actually made a mistake! If he had known things would end this way, he would not have let Chen Qiaoye give Yi Tao the medicine.

Yi Xuezheng kicked the door of the villa.

Bang!

The door was kicked open.

Seeing the people standing on the other side of the door, Yi Xuezheng was stunned.

On the side stood Wenru Li and Li Qingyue, their eyes widened in disbelief!
