“Then, she shouted into the room, “Old Woman, come out quickly! Shaoqing is here with his girlfriend! Old Woman! Come out quickly!””

“A moment later, an old woman with silver hair ran out from the room. “Shaoqing is here with his girlfriend? where is she? where is she?””

“Although Baizhi had quarreled with the Cen Old Lady, she was really good to Cen Shaoqing and the other juniors.”

“Hearing that Cen Shaoqing had a girlfriend, besides being happy, Baizhi was more in disbelief.”

“After all, when she had met Cen Shaoqing a few years ago, Cen Shaoqing had always been alone.”

She had taken great pains to find Cen Shaoqing a girlfriend. What did Cen Shaoqing Say?

He said that he had seen through the secular world and would become a monk in the future.

Baizhi had been scared out of her wits.

“This must be Shaoqing’s girlfriend!”Baizhi jogged over and grabbed ye Zao’s hand. “This little girl is so handsome! Not Bad! Not Bad!”

“Ye Zao greeted her politely, “Hello, aunt.””

“The more baizhi looked at Ye Zao, the more she liked him. It was as if she could not get enough of him. “Hello, Hello. I like this girl the moment I see her! Miss, What’s Your Name?””

“Ye Zhuo said with a smile: “Little aunt, I Call Ye Zhuo. Mouth Wood Leaf, burning its Hua Zhuo.””

“”Peach of the Yao Burning, this name is good!”Baizhi then said: “You see Aunt is old and confused, come in and sit! Come in and sit! Standing outside like what!””

The language falls to see has been barking the big black dog way: “Lai Fu don’t bark! Own people don’t know! You Silly Dog!”

Lai Fu immediately shut his mouth.

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “It’s so smart.””

“Baizhi said, “You can’t praise it. This silly dog can’t be praised.””

Lai Fu let out a ‘ow’to express his dissatisfaction.

On the other side.

“As soon as CEN Shaoqing and the others left, Bai Shu received a call from old Mrs. Cen.”

“Sister Tang.”Bai Shu answered the call.

“Old Mrs. Cen asked, “Little Shu, I heard that you allowed your third brother to bring back the one outside?””

“”Yes,”Bai Shu said.”

“Old Mrs. Cen frowned. “Little Shu, Little Shu, what should I say about you? Yingying treats you so well, how can you bear to let her go?””

“Bai Shu sighed, with red eyes, she said, “Sister Tang, I don’t want to be like this either. But with a son like this, what do you want me to do? Qiu Wen is already pregnant. I Can’t just stand by and watch the blood of the Zhao family run dry.””

“”Yingying hasn’t been pregnant for so many years. How can a mistress be pregnant so easily?”Old Mrs. Cen said bluntly, “Aren’t you afraid that she will give your third brother a cuckold?””

Zeng Qiuwen was an unorthodox person to begin with. What could she not do in order to get ahead?

“We’ve done amniocentesis before. Qiuwen is pregnant with the child of the Zhao family!”Bai Shu said.

Bai Shu was not the kind of person to be muddle-headed. She specially arranged for Zeng Qiuwen to have an amniocentesis. Only then did she let Zeng Qiuwen enter the Zhao family with ease.

“”Little Shu, Little Shu. What should I say about you!”Old Mrs. Cen also sighed, “No matter what, Yingying is the first wife of your third brother. Besides, you should know very well why your third brother married Yingying back then!””

“”I know, I know,”Bai Shu continued, “But I can’t force the child. I’ve beaten and scolded her, but it’s useless.””

“After saying that, Bai Shu continued, “In fact, I think it’s better to give Yingying freedom than to let her be trapped by third brother’s side.”What’s the point of not caring when she’s alive?”

Bai Shu also did not want to see Zhao Jiadong and du Yingying divorce.

She really had no choice.

“With the couple having reached this stage, even if they did not divorce, they would still be strangers in the future.”

“On the other side, Old Lady Cen did not say anything more. She only said, “Yingying is a good child. No matter what the reason is, cheating is not right. Even if you divorce, you and Yingying should not be too estranged.””

“”I know. When she left that day, I told her that although we are no longer mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, we will still be like mother and daughter. “In addition, I tried my best to compensate her for the money.”” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“It’s good that you know what to do.”Old Mrs. Cen chatted with Bai Shu for a while more before hanging up the phone.

“After hanging up the phone, she lamented, “Both Xiao Shu and her husband are pretty good. How did they end up with such a scoundrel of a son! ! What’s wrong with learning? Learn from Chen Shimei! Back then, Yingying treated him so well, but he just dumped her like that! If this were my son, he would have broken all my lackeys!””
