“Hearing this, brother Tao’s expression didn’t look too good. “LD and Louis have already terminated their contracts with us.” ”

“Terminated their contracts?”Song Chenyu frowned. “Just because of this matter?”

“”Yes.”Brother Tao nodded. “Although you’ve already posted a response on Weibo, this matter still has quite a big impact on us. There’s no rush to be discharged from the hospital here. You should recuperate properly first. When your body recovers, you can continue working.” ”

“Song Chenyu narrowed her eyes and continued, “Don’t worry, this matter won’t affect us in any way.” ”

Won’t affect us in any way?

“The matter has already been blown to such a big extent, and it still hasn’t affected us? ”

“Brother Tao touched song Chenyu’s forehead. “Chenyu, you don’t have a fever, right?” ”

“Song Chenyu curled the corners of her lips. “In a while, Ye Zhuo will delete his Weibo and apologize to me!” ”

“Miss Ye apologizes to you? Why?”Brother Tao was stunned. He thought he was hearing things.

“Song Chenyu continued, “I’m also one of the victims in this matter. If song Yiwan didn’t mislead me through Weibo, I definitely wouldn’t have responded to song Yiwan. “I’m innocent. Why should I accept ye Zao’s accusations? “Shouldn’t Ye Zao Apologize to me?” ”

Brother Tao felt that this matter was a little mysterious. “Then can ye Zao agree to it?”

“If ye Zao could agree to it, he wouldn’t have set song Chenyu up. He would have waited for song Chenyu to reply on Weibo before releasing that video. ”

“If ye Zao had released that video before song Chenyu replied, would song Chenyu still have replied to Song Yiwan on Weibo? ”

Definitely Not!

“From the beginning until now, Ye Zao had been trying to trick song Chenyu. ”

“She clearly had the video to prove her innocence, but she had insisted on dragging song Chenyu down with her. ”

All of this was ye Zao’s trick.

Song Chenyu narrowed his eyes. “Whether she agrees or not is not up to her.”

“After saying that, song chenyu continued, “When the hot search results come out later, LD and Louis will definitely regret canceling their contracts. When that time comes, just ignore them.”In this world, how could there be so much medicine for regret? ”

“Brother Tao still felt a little incredulous. “Chenyu, are you sure that Miss Ye will post an apology to you on Weibo?” ”

“”Yes, I’m sure.”Song Chenyu nodded. ”

Cen Yuyan was personally involved in this matter. Could there be a difference?

“Seeing that song Chenyu was so confident, brother Tao also heaved a sigh of relief. He smiled and said, “If ye Zhuozhen apologizes to you, then this matter is actually a good thing for us.” ”

“Don’t worry.”

“Brother Tao continued, “Then I’ll go back first.” ”

“En.”Song Chenyu nodded.

“After brother Tao left, song Chenyu’s phone rang. ”

“Song Chenyu picked up the phone and the corners of his mouth curled up slightly. He answered, “Hello, Yuyan.” ”

Why was Cen Yuyan Calling?

It was definitely because of the matter with Ye Zhuozhen.

“Although Cen Yuyan had yet to state her intentions, song Chenyu already had an idea. ”

“Cen Yuyan’s face was smeared with medicine, and the redness and swelling had already dissipated a little. However, her voice was a little unnatural. “Chenyu, I’m sorry...” ”

“When he heard the words ‘Sorry’, Song Chenyu’s heart thumped, and he suddenly had an ominous premonition. ”

“Song Chenyu tried his best to calm himself down and asked gently, “What’s wrong with Yuyan? Did Something Happen?” ”

“Cen Yuyan continued, “Ye Zhuo isn’t willing to delete Weibo or post an apology. Shaoqing isn’t here, so I can’t do anything to her.” ” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Song Chenyu frowned.

She didn’t expect ye Zhuo to not even give Cen Yuyan face.

What should she do now?

She had already told brother Tao everything.

“Although she did not feel good in her heart, song Chenyu’s voice was still gentle, “It’s Alright, Yuyan. To tell you the truth, I did not expect Miss Ye to apologize to me. Although you are fifth master’s sister, Miss Ye is not the kind of person who looks at others.” ”

“After saying that, song chenyu continued, “Yuyan, you must not feel guilty. I’m already very happy that you can stand up for me. Oh right, Yuyan, where are you now? Why do I feel that something is wrong when I Hear Your Voice?” ”

Cen Yuyan felt extremely wronged when she heard song Chenyu’s words.

She had never been slapped by anyone since she was young.

This was the first time.

What she found the most difficult to accept was that Cen Shaoqing actually hit her because of an outsider.

He even made her apologize to ye Zhuo!

“The more Cen Yuyan thought about it, the more wronged she felt. Her eyes were red, but Cen Yuyan still tried her best not to cry, she continued, “It’s fine. I just have a little cold and my throat isn’t feeling well. Oh right, sunfish, I still have something to do in C city. I Won’t be coming over to see you for a while. I’ll see you in the capital when you return.” ”
