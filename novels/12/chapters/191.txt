Chapter 192: 088: Big Brother Zao is online, I’ve finally found her! 5

Could it be that Mu Yourong is now the host of the Cheat System?

Ye Zao closed the current page.

He entered the URL and climbed over the wall into the database.

He easily found all the information about Mu Yourong.

Mu Yourong was the same age as her.

Before the age of 16, she was an extremely ordinary ordinary person.

But after the age of 17, Mu Yourong seemed to have changed.

She cheated all the way, turning from a trash in primary school to a genius in college.

She even became a grandmaster in chess.

One had to know that before this, Mu Yourong did not even know how to play gobang, nor did she attend any training classes.

After reading all this, Ye Zhuo was basically certain that Mu Yourong definitely had a cheat system.

Since Mu Yourong wanted to play, then she would play with her properly.

A cheat system, if played badly, would cause a backlash.

......

It was also at this moment that ye Zhuo suddenly understood why mu yourong had suddenly lost her luster during Miao Yin’s third anniversary party.

Because she had won against MU yourong, the system was forced to demote. After demotion, a lot of benefits would be taken back.

Not only would the benefits be taken back, but it would also reduce the host’s original appearance.

Ye Zhuo narrowed his eyes and deleted MU Yourong’s information.

He was prepared to respond to the Miao Yin platform’s questioning about her cosmetic surgery.

The best way to respond to cosmetic surgery was to find photos of her childhood. Ye Zhuo found the host’s previous social media account, but the photos in the account had all been destroyed.

Ye Zao frowned slightly. It seemed that Mu Yourong had long been prepared.

But she was not afraid.

Would a tech guru be afraid of the delete button?

As long as these photos had appeared on the Internet, she was not afraid.

Soon, ye Zao repaired the recycling station and found a few childhood photos from it, which he uploaded to Miao Yin’s account.

Although the original owner’s personality was a little strange when she grew up, it did not affect her looks when she was young.

He had a pretty face, and his facial features were very exquisite. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

[ let me introduce to the babies, this is the Me When I was young! Who doesn’t have a middle school past? Please forgive me and forget about me when I killed Matt. Then, regarding the problem of cheating, just wait for the college entrance exam! Let me tell you, my first choice is Beijing University, and I only filled out one choice, and I’m that confident! (picture jpg)(picture jpg)(picture jpg)

Purple gold hammer 1225: “Yezi is so beautiful! Haha actually, I also had the period of killing Matt!”

That dog: “A fairy has been a fairy since childhood! It seems that killing Matt was really popular a few years ago.”

I love Yezi 1: “Punch in Yezi!”

I love Yezi 77: “Welcome to Capital University!”

Who Are You: [ apply to Beijing University? That’s too arrogant! Aren’t you afraid of getting slapped in the face? ]

Ai Ya Ya 1063: [ only filling in one volunteer? This isn’t confidence, this is conceit! This is floating! ]

Gale Crossing 999: [ Beijing University’s admission score for Yunjing is 690 points. Wait and see! ]

After sending this statement, ye Zao exited the account.

Mu Yourong had been paying attention to ye Zao’s movements.

Seeing her statement, Mu Yourong frowned slightly.

Where did ye Zao get these photos?

Weren’t these photos destroyed by the system?

“System! What the hell is going on?”

The system was also a little flustered.

In the three years it had been in this foreign world, this was the first time it had met such a powerful human!

It could even repair the photos it destroyed with its own hands.

[ host, now is not the time to be anxious. We need to level up first. Only by leveling up can I have the authority to investigate more problems. ]

“How do I level up?”

The system sent over a web address, it then said, [ this is an international technology website. Complete the mission according to my instructions FIRST! ]! Then, use your ability to attract the attention of the big shots on the website. There are two objectives for this mission. The first is Dr. Warne, and the second is Niulu YC.”

Niulu YC?

Seeing this name, Mu Yourong frowned slightly and immediately thought of the leaves of Sitara YC.

Could it be that this Niulu YC was also ye Zao?

When she thought of this, Mu Yourong was stunned.

Then, she laughed softly, her eyes filled with sarcasm.

She was a reborn daughter, yet she knew nothing about technology.

Why was ye Zao?

Technology was not like chess. As long as one was willing to spend effort to study chess, it was fine. Technology not only needed to be studied, it also needed talent!

If ye Zao had this talent, he probably would not be called ye Zao.

He should be called Dr. Ye Zao, just like Dr. Warne.

Thinking of this, Mu Yourong heaved a sigh of relief. Following the system’s prompt, she began to register an account.
