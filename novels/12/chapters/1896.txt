“After saying that, Fang yinyue stood up from the sofa. “Sister-in-law, that’s all for now. I Won’t Disturb Your Rest.” ”

“Looking at Fang yinyue’s departing figure, Linda was a little stunned. She couldn’t even figure out what was going on! ”

Why did Fang yinyue go back!

“If Fang yinyue went back, then what about John and Li Yueyue? ”

“But now, she didn’t say a word. ”

Could it be that Fang yinyue and Li Sanzhu really didn’t want Li Yueyue to marry over?

No.

That was impossible!

“Linda pinched her fingers, feeling complicated. ”

She didn’t know why things had turned out this way.

This result was beyond her expectations.

“At this moment, Li Shuyi walked over from behind and said excitedly, “Mom, has the matter between cousin John and Li Yueyue been settled?” ”

“Hearing this, Linda’s expression didn’t look too good. ”

“Seeing this, Li Shuyi said, “Mom, what happened?” ”

“Linda said, “She didn’t come to talk about this just now.” ”

“Then why did she come?”Li Shuyi asked.

Linda’s heart was in a mess. “She came for your grandmother. Didn’t she make a fuss about going back to the country to retire?”

“Ah?”Li Shuyi’s face was also full of surprise.

“After saying that, Li Shuyi continued, “Mom, do you think she did it on Purpose?” ”

“If it was a few hours ago, Linda would have thought that Fang yinyue did it on purpose. ”

“But now, it seemed that Fang yinyue and the others didn’t do it on purpose. ”

They really didn’t seem to agree to Li Yueyue marrying into the Jones family.

The Jones family was one of the top ten old aristocrats in C nation. Why would they disagree?

Linda frowned. She had wanted to use Li Yueyue to change the fate of the Jones family. She did not expect such a thing to happen now.

On the other side.

“Tomorrow was the 28th of December. Li Yueyue gave ye Zao a bag. “Da Zao Zao, Guess What’s Inside?” ”

“Ye Zao looked at the bag and said, “Is it delicious?” ”

“In the past few days, Li Yueyue had always liked to give her all kinds of delicious food. ”

“That’s not right.”Li Yueyue shook her head.

“Dessert?”Ye Zhuo continued to ask.

“Li Yueyue smiled and said, “I already said it’s not delicious.” ”

“Other than the food and dessert, Ye Zhuo couldn’t think of anything else. He smiled and said, “Why don’t you just tell me directly?” ”

“”It’s clothes.”Li Yueyue opened the bundle and took out a red dress. “Da Zhuozhuo, look. This is the national characteristic of our prairie for the New Year.” ”

Ye Zao took the dress. “It’s so beautiful! Do you all wear this for the New Year?”

“The red pair of silk fabrics, the cuffs and necklines were embroidered with retro patterns. ”

It was very beautiful.

“”Yes.”Li Yueyue nodded, then, she said, “The children of our prairie will wear this to participate in the sacrificial activities. Oh right, we have a bonfire at night. We will sing and dance around the bonfire. Unmarried boys will also sing to attract the attention of girls.” ”

“Can we also participate in the sacrificial ceremony?”Ye Zhuo asked. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Li Yueyue said, “As long as you wear this set of clothes, you can participate. There is also one piece that belongs to Master Five. You sent it over to him. “Oh right, you have to wear it with boots. We don’t have any boots at home for the time being. Get the servant to send it over to you in a while. “Ye Zhuo, you have 36 feet, right?” ”

“Ye Zhonghua nodded slightly. “It’s 36 feet.”Although ye Zhonghua was tall and 173 feet tall, her feet were not big at all. ”

“”Okay.”Li Yueyue continued, “I still have things to do and have to go back first. Zhonghua, hurry up and send the clothes over to master five. While there’s still time, hurry up and try out the size of the clothes to see if they fit.” ”

“Okay.”

Ye Zhuozhuo sent the clothes over to Cen Shaoqing.

“In the blink of an eye, the next day arrived. ”

The 28th day of the twelfth lunar month.

The New Year on the prairie.

“Early in the morning, Ye Zhuozhuo was woken up by the crackling sound of firecrackers. ”

“The moment ye Zhuozhuo opened his eyes, he saw the video message that Li Yueyue had sent him. “Happy New Year, zhuozhuo! I’ll wait for You Downstairs!” ”

Ye Zao replied to her message and went to the changing room to change his clothes.

“This was a red one-piece dress that was very famous. It was a waist-pinching style. In addition, Ye Zao was tall and slim. His slim waist was almost as big as a fist. Coupled with a pair of black boots, he looked tall and thin. It was extremely eye-catching. ”

Ye Zao whistled at the mirror. He was very satisfied with the clothes on his body. They were much better looking than she had imagined.
