“Chapter 1153: 250: with the great burning, he will walk towards the peak of the financial world! 1”

“His voice was very light, but it seemed to be tinged with a magical power that could calm people’s hearts. ”

Jiang Xiaoyu raised his head slightly.

He saw a slender figure walking towards him.

“Against the light, his facial features could not be seen clearly. ”

“However, the powerful aura around him could not be ignored. ”

“Looking at the figure slowly walking towards him, Jiang Xiaoyu was stunned. ”

This feeling was like being bullied by other children when they were young and suddenly seeing their parents.

“She felt wronged, but she was no longer afraid, because the parents would definitely seek justice for her. ”

“”Ye, Miss Ye...” ”

Ye Zhuo took out a tissue and handed it to Jiang Xiaoyu. “Who bullied you?”

“It was a very simple sentence, but it made Jiang Xiaoyu’s emotions break down instantly. ”

Jiang Xiaoyu raised her head and burst into tears.

It was the kind of unrestrained crying.

Just like when she was young.

Ye Zao was a little flustered.

“She had seen many big scenes, but this was the first time she had seen such a scene. ”

She had never been very good at comforting people.

“Don’t Cry!”Ye Zao raised his hand to wipe away Jiang Xiaoyu’s tears. “What’s going on?”

“Hearing ye Zao’s words, Jiang Xiaoyu cried even more miserably and hugged ye Zao. ”

“Wu Wu...”

This scene was seen by the passing lawyer.

The lawyer frowned slightly.

It seemed that Zhao Xueyin was right.

Ye Zao had always been scheming. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“He knew that Jiang Xiaoyu was Zhao Xueyin’s best friend, yet ye Zao deliberately got close to Jiang Xiaoyu and took advantage of the situation. ”

This kind of person was indeed not worth being close to.

In addition.

He also found out that the reason why Jiang Xiaoyu changed her opinion of ye Zao was because Old Madam Jiang was trapped in the elevator and was saved by Ye Zao.

He also changed his opinion of ye Zao because of the elevator incident.

Perhaps.

The elevator incident was ye Zao’s plan.

They were all in ye Zao’s pocket.

It seemed that.

Ye Zao was simply too terrifying.

Si Lu narrowed his eyes and turned around to walk towards the conference room.

Over here.

“After a long while, Jiang Xiaoyu’s emotions slowly calmed down. ”

“”Ye... Miss Ye, I’m sorry. I’ve... I’ve dirtied your clothes,”Jiang Xiaoyu sobbed. ”

Ye Zao helped Jiang Xiaoyu sit down on a chair beside her. “It’s okay.”

“At this moment, Aili jogged over. “President Ye, the meeting is about to start!” ”

“Ye Zao raised his eyes slightly and said in a faint tone, “Postpone it for two hours.” ”

“Okay.”Aili nodded. “I’ll inform everyone right away.”

“Hearing that, Jiang Xiaoyu raised her head in surprise. “M-miss ye?” ”

She didn’t expect ye Zhuo to postpone the meeting for her.

“She felt a little guilty, a little surprised, and a little warm in her heart. ”

“Actually, these few days, she was the one who had been thick-skinned enough to go to the Ye family mansion. ”

“Most of the time, Ye Zhuo was busy with his own things. ”

She had thought that ye Zhuo had never taken her to heart.

“But now, it seemed like that wasn’t the case. ”

“Ye Zhuo didn’t say anything else. He held Jiang Xiaoyu’s hand and said, “Let’s go to my office.” ”

“Just like that, Jiang Xiaoyu was dragged into ye Zhuo’s office. ”

Allie wasn’t around.

Ye Zhuo brewed a cup of coffee for Jiang Xiaoyu.

Jiang Xiaoyu reached out and took it. “Thank you.”

She lowered her head and took a sip. The taste of the condensed milk and sugar cubes was very good.

“Seeing that Jiang Xiaoyu’s emotions had calmed down a lot, ye Zhuo said calmly, “Why? Aren’t you going to tell me what’s going on?” ”

His voice was still very clear.

“I...”Jiang Xiaoyu took another sip of coffee and didn’t know how to speak.

It was quite uncomfortable.

Ye Zao had just returned to the Shunxi Financial Group and his foundation was still unstable.

She couldn’t trouble ye Zao.

“Jiang Xiaoyu clenched her coffee cup. “I, I’m fine.” ”

“Why are you crying so miserably when you’re fine?”Ye Zao asked.

“Jiang Xiaoyu took a deep breath. “Miss Ye, you’re right. I’m just a pawn in Zhao Xueyin’s hands. I’m too stupid. I’ve been deceived by her for so many years...”she had even been humiliated by Zhao Xueyin today. ”

Jiang Xiaoyu couldn’t breathe when she thought of that incident.

“She was also the apple of her parents’eye, the daughter of the Jiang Corporation. ”

“Didn’t you know about this long ago?”

“Ye Zao’s red lips parted slightly, and his tone was a little flat. “If you treat me as a friend, tell me the truth.” ”

Friend.

“Hearing this, Jiang Xiaoyu raised her head and looked at ye Zao. ”

Could she become friends with ye Zao?

“Can... can we really become friends?”Jiang Xiaoyu asked.

Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly. “Aren’t we still friends now?”

“Jiang Xiaoyu was stunned at first, but then he realized, “Miss Ye, do you mean that we are friends now?” ”
