“Wu Qiang began to talk to Liu Chao. “Chao Zi, do you know?” ”

“Know what?”Liu Chao asked curiously.

“Wu Qiang continued, “Li Peng is married!” ”

“Is that true?”Liu Chao asked incredulously.

“Wu Qiang nodded, “Of course it’s true! Don’t look at how quiet this kid usually is. He’s actually quite shrewd! It was said that the woman was already three months pregnant! Not only did she not take a single cent of the betrothal gift money, but the woman even gave her a small car! “Don’t you think it’s Amazing?” ”

“It is indeed amazing! I really couldn’t tell!”ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“The more they talked, the more excited they became. Their voices were heard in the same car. Bai Mo frowned slightly, her eyes filled with impatience. She was already feeling carsick, and the noise in the car made her feel more and more dizzy. ”

“Shut up!”Bai Mo said impatiently.

Wu Qiang turned back to look at Bai Mo and frowned.

Was there something wrong with this woman?

It was not just a little bit wrong!

Liu Chao immediately made a gesture of putting his hands together in prayer.

Wu Qiang did not flare up because of Liu Chao’s face.

“Otherwise, based on Wu Qiang’s temper, he would have kicked her out long ago. ”

“Due to the traffic restrictions in the city, the speed of the car was not very slow. About an hour later, the car stopped beside a building. ”

“Wu Qiang then said, “We’re Here!” ”

“Liu Chao immediately got out of the car and walked to the other side. He respectfully opened the car door for Bai Mo and said, “Miss Bai, we’re here.” ”

Wu Qiang sat in the driver’s seat and looked at Liu Chao through the rearview mirror. He frowned in confusion.

Liu Chao was a little too respectful towards this crazy woman.

She was just a person with a mental illness. was there a need for him to do this?

Bai Mo opened her eyes and walked down while enduring her dizziness. “Is this the place?”

“Yes.”Liu Chao nodded.

“The Lin family manor was a historical site with a history of more than 200 years. Hence, the construction was very impressive. It was not something that the high-tech buildings in the s galaxy could compare to. ”

“Bai Mo looked at the majestic building in front of her and said, “Alright, you can go.” ”

Go?

Liu Chao was stunned.

“Seeing Liu Chao like this, Bai Mo frowned. “Why? Don’t you understand human language?”? ”

“Liu Chao continued, “Then can you go back alone later?” ”

“Although Earth was not as developed as the s galaxy, Bai Mo had just arrived and Liu Chao was a little worried. ”

“Bai Mo said coldly, “This is not a problem that you should be concerned about.” ”

“Liu Chao immediately shut his mouth and continued, “Then if anything happens to you, Miss Bai, just remember to call me.” ”

He hoped that Bai Mo would not contact him for the rest of her life.

“Bai Mo had just arrived and he had already spent nearly half of his wife’s books. If this continued, when would he be able to get married and have children? ”

Bai Mo ignored Liu Chao. She tidied her hair and walked into the building.

“Liu Chao returned to the car, closed the door of the passenger seat, and fastened his seatbelt. “Let’s go.” ”

“Wu Qiang asked curiously, “Where’s that woman?” ”

“Liu Chao said, “She has other matters to attend to. There’s no need to wait for her.” ”

“Wu Qiang watched Bai Mo’s back disappear in front, then, he said, “I didn’t realize that this mentally ill woman was actually related to the Lin family! What kind of person is she from the Lin Family? How do you guys know each other?”Liu Chao did not seem like the kind of person who would know the upper class. ”

“Liu Chao continued, “It’s a little complicated. I’ll explain it to you in detail when I have the chance. Let’s go back first.” ”

“Alright.”Wu Qiang was not the kind of person who talked too much.

Over here.

“Bai Mo came all the way to the Lin family manor’s main entrance. If she really wanted to take another step forward, she was suddenly stopped by the security guards who walked out of the security booth. ”

“Stop.”

“Bai Mo stopped in her tracks and frowned slightly. She was only a low-level earthling, yet she dared to stop her? ”

What audacity!

“However, Bai Mo still endured and didn’t flare up. After all, this was the Lin family’s territory. She had to leave a good impression on ye Shu. ”

Bai Mo did not forget the purpose of this trip.

“”Hello, I’m here to look for someone.”Bai Mo smiled. ”

“The security guard continued, “Who are you looking for? Do you have an appointment?” ”

“Bai Mo said, “I’m a relative of the Lin family.” ”

A relative of the Lin Family?

“Hearing this, the security guard sized up Bai Mo.. ”

“It seemed that the Lin family did not have such a relative. Moreover, if a relative of the Lin family came over, the butler would come over in advance to inform them. ”

“”Tell me your name. I need to verify it,”the security guard said. ”

Bai Mo nodded. “My name is Bai Mo. I’m Bai Jingshu’s cousin.”

The security guard then recalled that the Lin family did seem to be holding a wedding recently. Young Master Lin’s fiancée’s surname was Bai.
