“”40,000.”Yang Jiao threw out a mahjong card and said casually, “She hasn’t come back for a long time.” ”

“She’s still looking for her daughter?”

Yang Jiao nodded. “It’s still the same.”

“Can you still find her?”

“I think her daughter is long dead!”

“Of course!”

“Mrs. Wang continued, “Actually, I feel that she doesn’t have to do that at all! Your Weiyue treats her so well, she should be content!” ”

Everyone acknowledged that Xi Weiyue treated ye Langhua well.

“When others said that ye Langhua was a crazy woman, Xi Weiyue would come out to defend ye Langhua. ”

“When it was ye Langhua’s birthday, Xi Weiyue would secretly give her a surprise. ”

“Other than not having crawled out from ye Langhua’s stomach, Xi Weiyue was no different from her own daughter. ”

Unfortunately.

Some people did not know how blessed they were in life.

“”If she really knew how to be content, she wouldn’t have kept a secret from US until now.” ”

“Secret? What Secret?”Mrs. Wang asked curiously.

“Only then did Yang Jiao realize that she had misspoken. She smiled and said, “It’s nothing. I was just saying it casually. I was just messing around!” ”

“Why are you messing around again! ?”

“I’ve lost the whole afternoon!”

“”I’m not playing anymore! Our Old Wang is coming back tonight, I have to go back early!” ”

“”Then, I’m going back too!” ”

The few ladies came and left quickly.

Yang Jiao immediately stood up to send them off.

“Just as she sent the ladies out, Xi Muwen came back. ”

“The father and daughter came one after the other. Yang Jiao asked curiously, “Why are you back too?” ”

“Xi muwen said, “Weiyue asked me to come back.” ”

“This child is weird.”Yang Jiao followed them into the house.

“When they entered the house, Xi Weiyue was already sitting on the sofa in the living room. ”

“”Father, you’re back.” ”

Xi Muwen handed the briefcase to the maid. “What happened to you calling me back in such a hurry?”

Xi Weiyue’s expression did not look too good.

“What’s Wrong?”Yang Jiao frowned.

“XI weiyue continued, “That aunt might be looking for half a month soon.” ”

Xi Muwen’s heart skipped a beat. “What’s going on?”

Xi Weiyue explained the matter briefly.

“Yang Jiao said, “Could that man be from the Shunxi Financial Group?” ”

“Xi Weiyue nodded. “Mom, you’re thinking the same thing as me.” ”

Xi Muwen frowned deeply.

The reason why he had not touched ye Langhua for so many years was because ye Langhua was still useful.

“Even though ye Langhua had never admitted that she was related to the Shunxi Financial Group, Xi Muwen knew that ye Langhua must be inextricably linked to the Shunxi Financial Group. ”

Reality proved that his guess was correct.

“Seeing that Xi Muwen remained silent, xi weiyue continued, “Father, where exactly did you throw this child to back then? Is it still possible for Auntie to find her?” ”

“”Impossible,”XI muwen continued, “When I handed her over to that family, she had a fever for a day and a night.” ”

“Even an adult would not be able to withstand a fever for a day and a night, let alone a child that was only a few years old. ”

Xi Muwen still remembered how the child was panting from the fever. His face was as red as a hot iron.

Even though he really did not like that little bastard.

But that was still his blood after all.

He could only blame her for crawling out from ye Langhua’s stomach.

“Before he left, Xi Muwen had specially instructed that family not to read too many books to that child. If she could survive this high fever, just don’t starve to death to the stutterers. ”

“After all, she was ye Langhua’s daughter. ”

“Ye Langhua was a talented girl. If she continued to read to her, it would be inevitable that she would rise to the top. ”

“Xi Muwen hated ye Langhua. He did not want to give that child any chance to rise to the top, even if that child was related to him by blood. ” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Not to mention whether that high fever had killed that child, even if she was still alive, she did not even know her own background. How could she embark on the path of finding her mother? ”

“All these years, ye Langhua’s focus had been on the abducted child, so she had no reason to suspect a child with a father and mother. ”

So...

She would definitely not be able to find her own biological daughter!

Perhaps that person was just lying to Ye Langhua.

“XI weiyue continued, “Father, what if it really is?” ”

Xi Muwen did not say anything.

“If it really was, then all his efforts would have been in vain. ”

More than thirty years of efforts would have been in vain!

No!

Such a thing could not happen.
