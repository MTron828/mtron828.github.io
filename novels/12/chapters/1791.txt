“But the strange thing was that Yu Zifei and the little assistant seemed to be covered by something, unable to find any trace. ”

“In the blink of an eye, it was the next morning. ”

“After a night of walking, at this time, the little assistant and Yu Zifei were both severely dehydrated and hungry. ”

The little assistant looked at the endless desert and felt even more uncomfortable.

When will they be able to walk out of the desert?

“Yu Zifei took out the only biscuit left in his pocket, broke it open, and gave half of it to the little assistant. “Eat the biscuit first.” ”

“The little assistant looked at Yu Zifei and said, “Team leader Yu, Can Miss Ye and the others really find us?” ”

What if they couldn’t find us?

“They will.”Yu Zifei nodded.

“Then when will they find us?”The assistant immediately asked.

“”Very soon.”Yu Zifei took a bite of his biscuit and said, “Li Xiang, don’t worry. We will definitely return to Earth alive.” ”

“Seeing Yu Zifei so calm, the assistant’s mood immediately improved. He nodded and said, “Team leader Yu, I believe in you.” ”

“Yu Zifei smiled and said, “What’s the first thing you want to do when we get back?” ”

“”Have a good meal and then call my parents to tell them that we’re safe.”At this point.., the little assistant continued, “I don’t know if the base has notified my parents! I hope that they won’t be notified for the time being. How Old are my parents? They won’t be able to withstand such a blow.” ”

“After all, this was Mars. ”

“Yu Zifei nodded. “What you said makes sense, but I don’t think miss ye has informed them.” ”

“”I hope so.”The assistant nodded and then said, “I really hope that they can find us earlier.” ”

“In the blink of an eye, another day passed. ”

“Yesterday, the two of them had at least eaten half a biscuit, but today, they had not eaten a drop of water. ”

“In order to conserve their energy, the two of them sat on the spot and rested. ”

The little assistant leaned against the volcanic rock and looked at the horizon with anticipation.

Yu Zifei closed his eyes to rest.

“The Little Assistant’s voice was already a little hoarse. “Team leader Yu, do you think that Miss Ye has already given up looking for us?” ”

“It had been three days and three nights since the incident, but there had been no movement from ye Zhuo’s side. The price of searching for people on Mars was not small. ”

“The little assistant was very worried now. If ye Zao could not find them, he did not want to look for them anymore and planned to compensate them. ”

“After all, he only needed to compensate them once. ”

“And if he kept looking, the cost would not stop. ”

“”Miss Ye is not that kind of person,”Yu Zifei said. ”

“The little assistant sniffed. “I know that Miss Ye is not that kind of person, but the problem now is that Miss Ye has not found us. Will she think that something has happened to us and give up looking for us!” ”

“”That won’t happen,”Yu Zi refuted. ”

“”Then when will miss ye be able to find us?”The little assistant was on the verge of tears. She continued, “I’m worried that by the time Miss Ye finds us, we’ll already be...” ”

“After all, humans could only live for four to five days at most when they were dehydrated. If they didn’t eat, they could live for around ten days. Now that they had no water and no food, how many more days could they live? ”

“One day, or two days? ”

“As long as ye Zhuo could not find them, they would be in danger. ”

“Moreover, the feeling of hunger was too unbearable. There were several times when the little assistant wanted to end her life, but she was afraid of pain. ”

“If she did not die, there might be a chance of being saved. If she died just like that, there would be no hope at all! ”

“”That won’t happen,”Yu Zifei said with determination in his eyes. “We’ll definitely be able to hold on until Miss Ye comes over.” ”

“”Team leader Yu, you’re too optimistic...” ” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Yu Zifei leaned against the volcanic rock and continued, “Li Xiang, hold on a little longer.” ”

“”I can’t hold on any longer,”the little assistant cried. “Team leader Yu, I really can’t hold on any longer. This place is a hemisphere away from the base. We don’t have any communication devices or locators on us. How could miss ye possibly find us?” ”

This was the first time the assistant had cried in three days.

“”Team leader Yu, I’m an only child. My parents are still counting on me to take care of them! I really can’t Die!” ”

“Yu Zifei turned to look at the assistant and continued, “I’m also an only child.” ”

The assistant was stunned.

“”You, you too?” ”

Yu Zifei nodded.

“The assistant felt a little better and continued, “Then how old are your parents?” ”

“Yu said, “My father is fifty-three and my mother is fifty-two. What about your family?” ”
