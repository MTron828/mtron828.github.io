“”Quiet down. I’m your instructor, Gu Zuocheng.”The instructor held the name list in his hand. “Now, Let’s start the roll call. Call out the names.””

“Song Ruxue.”

“Here!”

“Zhao Wenjun.”

“Here!”

“Li Wenbin.”

“Here!”

“Li Yueyue.”

“Here!”

“...”

“Ye Zao.”

“Here.”

So she was ye Zao.

Song Ruxue looked in ye Zao’s direction and narrowed her eyes.

Song ruxue was Feng Xianxian’s best friend.

“Last night, she received a wechat message from Feng Xianxian. Feng Xianxian asked her to give ye Zao some suffering during military training.”

She had thought that ye Zao was just an ordinary little girl.

She did not expect ye Zhuo to be so beautiful.

No Wonder Feng Xianxian was afraid of her.

“After the roll call, the instructor corrected everyone’s military posture. He practiced walking upright, standing at attention, taking a rest, and turning between stops...”

Gu Zuocheng was a very strict instructor. He did not allow any small flaws.

“After two hours, everyone was miserable.”

One had to know that this group of university students were usually pampered at home. When had they ever suffered like this?

“While resting on the spot, Li Yueyue looked at ye Zao curiously. “Zao Zao, why don’t you look tired at all?””

She was as tired as a dog.

“When she looked at ye Zao again, she did not even take a deep breath.”

Ye Zao’s tone was indifferent. “Maybe it’s because I’ve practiced before.”

In the afternoon.

“When ye Zao went to the bathroom, she was saddened to find that her period had come early!”

“Because it was the first day, ye Zao had some chronic menstrual cramps. When she practiced in the afternoon, she seemed a little absent-minded.”

“”The fifth girl in the third row, Step Out!””

“Ye Zao, who was suddenly called out, stood out.”

“Gu Zuocheng said with a dark face, “What’s going on? Didn’t you eat? Or do you know all these things that I taught you?””

Ye Zao stood up straight. “Yes! I know!”

“Hearing that, the other students looked at ye Zao in surprise.”

One had to know that Gu Zuocheng had just demonstrated the military boxing that he had taught everyone.

Ye Zao knew it already?

He must be bragging!

The girls standing in the middle were discussing animatedly.

“”What’s wrong with ye Zao? She did it on purpose, right?””

“”I think she just wants to attract the attention of our instructor. After all, she’s so good-looking. Once she attracts the attention of the instructor, she’ll be given special treatment.””

“Song Ruxue was worried that she couldn’t find a way to torture ye Zao, but she didn’t expect ye Zao to come to her door of his own accord. She spoke in a contemptuous tone, “Some people rely on their good looks to get the instructor to look at her differently. Unfortunately, our instructor is a rough man, a straight man of steel. I’m afraid she’s going to miscalculate.””

“Hearing this, the crowd immediately burst into laughter.”

Song ruxue was right.

Gu Zuocheng was a rough man.

“He never had any feelings for beauty, nor did he know how to be kind to women.”

“Seeing that ye Zhuo was so arrogant.., gu Zuocheng said with a cold face, “You know it, right? Then show me the military boxing that I just taught you! If you don’t know it, run twenty laps around the field! Otherwise, you won’t be able to eat dinner tonight!””

As soon as he said that.

The girls looked like they were watching a good show.

Running twenty laps on the field!

It was really too pitiful.

Ye Zhuo narrowed his eyes and walked to the front.

“Gu Zuocheng faced the crowd, with a straight face, he said, “During the military training period, I will train you strictly according to the military system. It’s the same for men and women! After all, the bullets of the enemy on the battlefield won’t miss just because you are a girl! “Don’t think that some people can get preferential treatment just because they’re a girl! “All of you, be more down-to-earth!””

“After saying that, all the students stared at the front with their mouths Agape.”

Gu Zuocheng frowned slightly.

“When he was teaching them military boxing, these little brats weren’t that serious, but they were more active when looking at beautiful women!”

They deserved a beating!

Gu Zuocheng tilted his head and looked at Ye Zhuo.

When he looked at her.

Gu Zuocheng was also stunned.

Ye Zhuo’s military boxing was already halfway done. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Whether it was kicking or punching, they were all very standard. Their movements were fluid, and there was an aura that could not be imitated.”

She was clearly the only one in front.

But she gave off the aura of an army!

“Gu Zuocheng was born a soldier, so he naturally knew that many professional female soldiers would not be able to do what she did.”

It would be a lie to say that he was not surprised!

Gu Zuocheng did not expect ye Zhuo to really know military boxing.

And it was so powerful!

“After a set of military boxing, Gu Zuocheng asked, “What’s Your Name?””
