“Oh my God! This is amazing!”

“Miss Ye is so amazing!”

“”That’s not right. Logically speaking, people in outer space should have lost gravity long ago. Why is Cen Jiang still walking around?””

“Could he really be a liar?”

“Cen Jiang held a special camera and walked out of the cabin. He seemed to have predicted everyone’s doubts, as he walked, he said, “Everyone must be very curious now. Why have we left Earth and not lost gravity? This is because Miss Ye has installed a special chip on the aircraft carrier! “Oh right, look, that Blue Planet is our earth!””

“When they saw Earth, everyone’s expression changed.”

“Cen Jiang installed the camera on the railing of the aircraft carrier, he then said, “The aircraft carrier is about to return to the speed of light. During the speed of light, the camera may not be able to capture as clearly as it is now. Everyone, just wait and see. In four hours, we will meet on Neptune.””

“Seeing this scene, Tang Xue took a few steps back.”

No.

It couldn’t be.

It was impossible!

It was impossible for ye Zhuo to create an aircraft carrier that was faster than the speed of light.

“If all of this was true, then what should she do?”

“Tang Xue clutched her hair tightly, her face pale.”

“Even in her dreams, Tang Xue would never have thought that the aircraft carrier that ye Zao had created would actually be able to soar into the sky.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

What was going on?

What was going on?

“”Miss Tang, don’t be anxious.”At this moment, Xiao Lu appeared beside Tang Xue.”

Tang Xue lowered her head and looked at Xiao Lu.

“Xiaolu continued, “No one knows where the aircraft carrier and ye Zao are right now. Even if they are really in space, what can they do if they fly to Neptune? Even if they were lucky enough to land on Neptune within four hours, they might not be able to return safely. “Neptune is a gaseous planet with no landing point. Its atmosphere is made up of 80% hydrogen, 19% helium, and 1% methane. In addition, not only is there no oxygen on Neptune, but there is also the strongest storm in the solar system. The average wind speed is as high as 2100 km/h.””

“Xiao Lu paused and smiled. “Do you think it’s possible to survive on such a harsh planet? If ye Zhuo doesn’t make it back alive, the bet will be lost, and you will be the one to win.””

Ye Zhuo was dreaming of landing on a gaseous planet without a landing point. Wasn’t that a dream?

She was afraid that her life would be over before she reached Neptune!

“After hearing Xiao Lu’s words, Tang Xue’s mood improved a lot.”

Xiao Lu was right.

“The universe was unpredictable, and Neptune was extremely cruel. It was the first time humans had set foot on Neptune, so they did not have any experience. Whether ye Zao could come back or not was a question. Why should she worry about things that would never happen?”

“On the big screen, although the camera was high-tech and could not capture the environment of the universe at the speed of light, it could roughly see the situation.”

“Ye Zhuo sat in the main control cabin with a calm expression. At this moment, she felt as if she had returned to the world she lived in.”

The familiar universe.

The familiar environment.

Except for the lack of flying vehicles and space junk.

“One had to know that in her era, human footprints could be seen everywhere in the universe.”

“At present, the technological civilization was still developing. Human footprints were only on the Moon for the time being, and they had never set foot on other planets.”

Time passed very quickly.

“In the blink of an eye, four hours had passed.”

“Cen Jiang and the others had already put on special spacesuits and came to the main control cabin. “Miss Ye, we’ll be landing in 20 minutes.””

“Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and continued, “The conditions on Neptune are very harsh, and danger can happen at any time. You must pay attention to your safety. After collecting the samples, return to the cabin!””

“I understand.”The few of them nodded.

“Ye Zao then gave everyone a laser gun and an economic communicator, “Bring this. Before landing on Neptune, try out the spacesuit first! Then, keep in touch at all times. Remember, you only have one hour on Neptune! No matter what happens, you must return to the cabin after one hour!””

Chen Hao looked at ye Zao with admiration. “Father Zao! You Look So Cool Now! Have you been to Neptune before?”

“”Yes, a few times,”ye Zao continued, “But at that time, there was nothing left to mine on Neptune.””

There were pros and cons to the rapid development of human civilization.
