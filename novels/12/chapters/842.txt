Although Zhou Xiang didn’t know how to draw.

“But under the influence of old Mrs. Cen for so many years, she more or less knew a little. ”

The painting in front of her couldn’t be drawn without a master who had decades of experience.

Every painter had their own style of drawing.

This painting had a unique craftsmanship. It was lifelike and focused on details. Even the facial expressions of the old fisherman on the river could be clearly seen.

“Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “You know the person who painted this painting.” ”

“”I know him too?”Zhou Xiang was stunned and asked curiously, “Who is it?” ”

“Guess.”Old Mrs. Cen remained mysterious.

Zhou Xiang thought for a moment. “Is it Lai Dong?”

Lai Dong was a newcomer that old Mrs. Cen had met three years ago in the Chinese painting world.

Old Mrs. Cen shook her head.

“Is that Yun Qian?”

“No.”

“Zhou Xiang had guessed several names in a row, but old Mrs. Cen had denied it. ”

“”Mom, don’t Keep Me in suspense. Just tell me who it is.” ”

Old Mrs. Cen smiled at Zhou Xiang. “Try to guess as close as possible.”

“”Guess as close as possible?”Zhou Xiang was even more confused. “Mom, can you give me more hints?” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “This person is a member of our family.” ”

Family member?

“Zhou Xiang’s mouth was wide open. “It can’t be that Shaoqing painted it, right?” ”

But it had been ten years since Shaoqing had touched the brush.

“”It’s not him.”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “I’m not even willing to take a look at that Brat’s painting.” ”

“This time, Zhou Xiang was even more surprised. “It can’t be burning, right?” ”

“Yes! Xiangxiang! You’re really too smart! It’s Yezi!”Old Mrs. Cen stood up excitedly.

“It’s really searing’s drawing?”

“Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “Can I still lie to you about such things?” ”

“Zhou Xiang’s face was filled with disbelief. “Searing is too amazing!”Zhou Xiang had always known that ye Zao was amazing, but she did not expect that ye Zao could even draw so well! ”

“Old Madam Cen said with a proud face, “Of course! If my granddaughter-in-law isn’t amazing, who is?” ”

“Zhou xiang smiled and said, “Then she is also my daughter-in-law.” ”

“Cen Yuyan walked in from outside. “Mom, Grandma, what are you guys talking about?” ”

“Zhou Xiang waved at Cen Yuyan. “Yuyan, come over and take a look.” ”

“What are you looking at?”Cen Yuyan walked over curiously. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Zhou xiang continued, “Yuyan, what do you think of this painting?” ”

“Cen Yuyan lowered her head to take a look, and her face was full of surprise. ”

“Cen Yuyan was a person with artistic talent. She had also studied Chinese painting before, so she naturally knew that this painting was not ordinary. ”

“”The meticulous structure of the brush strokes is strict, and the strokes are as smooth as flowing clouds and flowing water. It’s natural and thick and lively. Why isn’t there a signature underneath this painting? Which Master drew it?” ”

“Zhou xiang smiled and said, “Your sister-in-law drew it.” ”

“Cen Yuyan was stunned for a moment before she reacted and continued, “It’s... Burning?” ”

“”Yes, it’s her.” ”

“Cen Yuyan frowned, and disbelief flashed through her eyes. ”

Ye Zhuo?

How could someone like ye Zhuo draw such a beautiful painting?

How was that possible!

“Cen Yuyan continued, “Mother, did you see burning with your own eyes?” ”

“”I didn’t,”Zhou Xiang continued, “Your grandmother took this painting back from the burning house.” ”

Gautama’s expression flashed across Cen Yuyan’s eyes. “Then did grandmother see the burning painting with her own eyes?”

Cen Yuyan had a foundation in painting.

“With just a glance, she knew that the person who painted this painting had at least a few decades of foundation. ”

How Old was ye Zao?

How could she draw such a painting?

It was simply a fantasy!

“Old Mrs. Cen frowned slightly. “Cen Yuyan, what’s the meaning of this weird behavior?” ”

“Cen Yuyan smiled and said, “Grandma, didn’t I just casually ask? Where’s The Weird Behavior?” ”

“Looking at Old Mrs. Cen’s appearance, Cen Yuyan knew that old Mrs. Cen definitely had not seen ye Zao draw with her own eyes. ”

“She was about to be sold by Ye Zao, yet she still had to count the money for ye Zao! ”

She was really too stupid!

“It was one thing for old lady cen to be stupid, but now she had to bring the whole family along to be stupid. ”

“Cen Yuyan suppressed the anger in her heart and smiled. “I know that Zao Zao is powerful, and I also know that you like Zao Zao, but you shouldn’t be so biased. I just casually said a few words, and you’re just going to insult your biological granddaughter like this?” ”

“She was her biological granddaughter, and she was related to Old Lady Cen by blood. ”

Ye Zao was just a person with another surname.

Cen Yuyan even suspected that Old Lady Cen had been bewitched by someone.

So stupid that it made people want to cry.

Wait.

She had to find a chance to personally tear apart ye Zao’s true colors in front of everyone.
