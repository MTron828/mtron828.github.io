Translator: 549690339

“If ye Zhuo wasn’t grandfather Ye’s descendant, would she have been able to enter the Shunxi Financial Group so easily? ”

“Elder Zhang nodded. “Yes, this is elder Ye’s great-granddaughter, Ye Zhuo. Zhuo Zhuo, this is the chairman of the Shunxi Financial Group, Si Lu.” ”

Ye Zhuo extended his hand to Si Lu. “Chairman Si.”

“The Si Lu reached out to hold ye Zao’s hand. “Miss Ye, we’ll be working in the same place from now on. Please give us some guidance.” ”

“Sure.”Ye Zao’s tone was indifferent.

“The Si Lu’s expression was the same as usual. He turned to look at elder Zhang. “Elder Zhang, it’s windy outside. Why Don’t we go up first? Miss Zhao is already waiting in the office.” ”

“Alright.”Elder Zhang nodded.

The lawyer led the way.

“Elder Zhang and Ye Zhuo walked at the back. As they walked, they introduced the lawyer to Ye Zhuo in a low voice, “The lawyer is a capable and ambitious person. “Fortunately, he has a good character. Although he is close to the Zhao family, he is not like the Zhao family. If you encounter any difficulties in your work, you can consult him. “He is a trustworthy person.” ”

Trustworthy?

Si Lu?

She did not think so.

Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly. “You know him very well?”

“Elder Zhang smiled and said, “I watched this child grow up. I know his character the best.” ”

“”People change,”ye Zhuo said faintly. ”

“Upon hearing this, elder Zhang turned to look at Ye Zhuo. ”

His eyes were filled with confusion.

Then...

Had Si Lu really changed?

“Not long after, the three of them arrived at the 58th floor. ”

The office door was closed.

Si Lu reached out and knocked on the door.

“Come in.”

Si Lu gently pushed the door open and gestured for elder Zhang and ye Zao to enter first.

Elder Zhang brought ye Zao in.

“Seeing the elder, Zhao Xueyin immediately stood up from her office chair. “Elder Zhang, you’re here.” ”

Elder Zhang nodded. He was just about to introduce ye Zhuo to Zhao Xueyin.

“Zhao Xueyin smiled at Ye Zhuo. “Ye Zhuo, long time no see.” ”

Ye Zhuo raised his eyes slightly. “I’ve said that there’s still time in the future.”

Was Ye Zhuo provoking her?

Was she worthy?

“Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes, concealing the expression in her eyes. ”

“Elder Zhang asked curiously, “Zhuo Zhuo, have you met Xueyin before?” ”

“En.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“”That’s right. There’s still plenty of time in the future.”Zhao Xue Yin continued, “Right, elder Zhang, president Yu has just retired. What do you think about me arranging for ye Zhuo to temporarily replace President Yu?” ”

Zhao Xue Yin was talking about temporarily replacing President Yu.

President Yu still had a pile of mess waiting for ye Zhuo to clean up.

She was elder Ye’s descendant.

“If she didn’t even have the slightest ability to manage and solve problems, how would she be able to convince the masses in the future? ”

“If she stood high, she would fall miserably. ”

“At that time, even if she didn’t say anything, Ye Zhuo would still be thrown off the stage by the crowd. ”

This was called flattery.

Elder Zhang was stunned.

He couldn’t quite understand what kind of show Zhao Xueyin was singing.

The president was second only to Zhao Xueyin.

Would she be so good as to arrange for ye Zhuo to be the president?

“Seeing Old Zhang like this.., zhao Xueyin continued, “If you feel that it’s not suitable, we can sit down and discuss it. However, Sister Ye Zao is Aunt Lang’s granddaughter after all. If we arrange for other departments, I’m afraid it would be somewhat inappropriate.” ”

“Old Zhang reacted at this time and said with a smile, “Then that’s it! Xueyin, you’ve considered this matter very thoroughly! No matter what, Zao Zao is Old Ye’s descendant. Her starting point can not be too low.” ”

“”Then it’s decided.”After saying that, Zhao Xueyin looked at ye searing, her tone gentle, “Sister ye searing, although President Yu left behind some problems when he left, I believe that with your ability, these problems aren’t problems.” ”

The problems president Yu left behind were problems that couldn’t be solved.

Ye searing had no business talent at all.

Could she solve it?

It was simply impossible!
