Mother Zhou came out from inside.

Mother Zhou was fifty-six years old this year. Her skin was very white and her cheekbones were high. Her eyes were hanging from the top and her body was plump. One look and one could tell that she was not an easy person to get along with.

“Where’s My Dad?”Zhou Rui asked.

“”He went to play cards.”Speaking of this, mother Zhou was very unhappy. “He’s already so old, yet he still goes around fooling around all day! Doesn’t he find it embarrassing?” ”

“At this moment, footsteps came from outside the door. “What are you talking about in front of your son again?” ”

“Did I say something wrong?”Mother Zhou stood up in anger.

“”Alright, Alright, stop arguing.”Zhou Rui drank a mouthful of water. “I came back today because I have something to announce.” ”

“What is it?”Father Zhou looked at Zhou Rui.

Mother Zhou immediately shut up.

The world was so big that it was not as important as her son’s matter.

“Zhou Rui continued, “This Saturday, I’m bringing my girlfriend back.” ”

“When she heard this, mother Zhou said excitedly, “Really? Does that mean I’m going to have a grandchild? Oh right, is the woman from Beijing? She can’t be a non-local! Our family is not like before!” ”

Beijing’s local families were all exceptionally wealthy.

“After all, this was the capital of China. ”

“Zhou Rui said, “Don’t worry, she’s a local.” ”

“When she heard this, mother Zhou heaved a sigh of relief and continued, “It’s good that she’s a local. Son, let me tell you, with your conditions, let alone a local, you can even find a heiress.” ”

Zhou Rui was about 1.8 meters tall. He had a good figure and a good-looking face. He had thick eyebrows and big eyes. It was unknown how many young ladies were trying to get close to him.

“Father Zhou continued, “How old is the woman this year?” ”

“39.”

“What?”Father Zhou stood up in surprise. “39?”

“Yes.”Zhou Rui nodded.

“Father Zhou said angrily, “No, I don’t agree! Zhou Rui, are you crazy? Or are all the women in the world dead? You actually found such an old woman!” ”

Zhou Rui was only 20 years old this year.

That woman was almost 40 years old!

Could Father Zhou agree?

“Mother Zhou said, “I don’t agree either! She’s already 40 years old! If people who don’t know saw this, they would think that our family has recruited an old woman! You want such an old woman? Rui Rui! Are you out of your mind?” ”

“Zhou Rui continued, “My girlfriend’s surname is Cen. She’s the Cen family’s fourth young miss.” ”

Fourth young miss?

This title was not something that an ordinary person could use.

“Zhou rui continued, “Father, mother, do you know Cen Fifth Master?” ”

CEN fifth master?

“Although the Zhou family’s parents had just moved to the capital, they had also heard of this name. ”

“After all, in the capital, the title Cen Fifth Master was a symbol of power! ”

It was an existence that covered the skies with one hand.

A person like CEN fifth master was not someone that ordinary people like them could easily meet.

“Father Zhou immediately reacted and said in disbelief, “Your girlfriend is Cen Wu Ye’s Daughter?” ”

“”No.”Zhou rui smiled and said, “Cen Wu ye is not married yet.” ”

“Hearing this, the light in Father Zhou’s eyes instantly disappeared. ”

Mother Zhou also pursed her lips.

“At that moment, she thought that their family had hooked up with some big shot. ”

She did not expect that it had nothing to do with Fifth Master Cen.

“Zhou rui smiled and said, “Although my girlfriend is not fifth master Cen’s daughter, she is indeed fifth master Cen’s fourth sister.” ”

When he said that.

The Zhou family’s parents were immediately stunned.

“”Rui Rui, what did you say?”Mother Zhou swallowed her saliva. ”

Fourth Sister!

Fifth Master Cen’s fourth sister.

Didn’t this mean that Zhou Rui was going to become fifth master Cen’s brother-in-law in the future?

“The more mother Zhou thought about it, the more excited she became. She almost fainted. ”

Zhou Rui repeated what he had just said. “I said that my girlfriend is CEN Fifth Master’s fourth sister.”

“Is she really CEN fifth master’s fourth sister?”Father Zhou excitedly grabbed Zhou Rui’s hand.

“Yes.”Zhou Rui nodded.

“Father Zhou continued, “In that case, I will be CEN Fifth Master’s fourth sister’s father-in-law from now on.” ”

“Yes.”

“Mother Zhou continued, “Then I’ll be Cen Fifth Master and fourth sister’s mother-in-law?” ”

“Yes.”Zhou Rui nodded again.

“Oh my God!”Mother Zhou was so excited that she pressed her palms together. “How is my son so capable! To think that even CEN fifth master’s fourth sister would throw herself at my son!”

Father Zhou’s face was also filled with glory.

“He had long known that his son was capable, but he did not expect that his son would actually throw himself at someone like Cen fourth sister. ”

“Zhou rui smiled and said, “Now you won’t object to us being together, right?” ”

“Mother Zhou smiled and said, “Although I’m a little old, my family background is still passable.” ”𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m
