Translator: 549690339

“”It’s good that you know.”The Great Witch Doctor placed the injection on the table, his face full of displeasure, “There are still a few days before the election. Get Miss Qiu Ready. She’s about to become a female sovereign. Remember to use your brain when you’re in trouble!” ”

“”Yes, yes, yes, you’re right!”Qiu Changzhen nodded repeatedly. “If there’s nothing else, Great Witch Doctor, we’ll be leaving first.” ”

The Great Witch Doctor waved his hand impatiently.

Qiu Changzhen immediately left with Qiu Di.

“After leaving, Qiu di looked at Qiu Changzhen. “You can be at ease now, right?” ”

“”Yes.”Qiu Changzhen nodded and continued, “I can be at ease, but I still feel a little strange. Who are the people who took Yi Ling and stole ye Zao’s corpse! What are their motives!” ” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

It was going to be the day of the general election soon. Qiu Changzhen was worried that there would be problems during the general election.

“Didn’t the Great Witch Doctor Say It? They are just the remnants of ye Zao. They are just a bunch of small fries. They are nothing to be afraid of.”Qiu Di said.

Qiu Changzhen nodded.

“Qiu di continued, “Father, the most important thing now is to not let this matter spread to the ears of the six clan leaders!” ”

“If the six clan leaders knew that Yi Ling had been rescued, he would definitely turn against them. ”

“Yes.”

On the other side.

Yi Ling slowly opened her eyes.

Before her eyes was a vast expanse of whiteness.

Where was she?

She seemed to have had a dream.

“In the dream, Ye Zhuo had come back to save her. ”

Was it just a dream?

“At this moment, a clear and shallow voice rang in her ears, “You’re awake? Quickly eat something.” ”

“At the same time, the fragrance of the hundred spirit fruit drifted into the air. ”

“Yi Ling suddenly sat up from the bed. When she saw the person beside the bed, she jumped up excitedly and hugged her, “Da Zhuozhuo! That’s great, I’m Not Dreaming!” ”

“Ye Zhuo patted its small head and said, “Don’t worry, this isn’t a dream.” ”

“”Da Zhuozhuo, quickly hit me,”Yi Ling continued. ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Quickly eat something. Otherwise, you’ll really starve to death.” ”

“Yi Ling immediately pounced on the hundred spirit fruit and started munching on it. “Great, I’ve finally eaten the hundred spirit fruit!” ”

Only God knew how much it wanted to eat the hundred spirit fruit these days.

“After eating the entire hundred spirit fruit, Yi Ling still didn’t feel full. It picked up another one and munched on it, then the third, fourth, fifth... ”

“When she picked up the seventh one, Ye Zhuo reached out to stop her. ”

“”Dog, you can’t eat anymore.” ”

“Under normal circumstances, Yi Ling’s appetite was three at a time, and four was already her limit. ”

“Yi Ling raised her head to look at Ye Zhuo and sat on her feet. Her eyes suddenly reddened. “Da Zao Zao, am I Really Not Dreaming?” ”

“”No.”Ye Zhuo picked her up and continued, “Did you just say that Ye Han betrayed us?” ”

“”Yes.”Yi Ling nodded, “Not only has ye Han defected, he is now Qiu Di’s Lackey! He even changed his surname! His name is Wu Han now. What’s even more ridiculous is that he even said that Qiu di is his benefactor! “Oh right, there’s also that wicked woman, Qiu Di. She is the most shameless! “She told everyone that you were already dead. She even said that you handed over the position of crown prince to her before the accident! “What’s even more ridiculous is that she said that she was your Savior!” ”

“At this point, Yi Ling paused, then, she continued, “Many people have been deceived by Qiu Di! Especially the eight great families. They even gave Qiu di the information on the inter-star case! “It’s a good thing that you’re back. Otherwise, the Changyue Kingdom would really be overshadowed by this wicked woman, Qiu Di!” ”

Ye Zao frowned slightly.

“”Great Zao! Quickly go and kill the shameless father and daughter of Qiu Chang Town and Qiu Di! It’s all because of them. If something happened to you in the experiment, it must be their doing too!” ”

“”No,”ye Zao continued, “Just based on Qiu Chang Town and Qiu Di, they don’t have such abilities. There must be more than one person behind this.” ”

“Upon hearing this, Yi Ling seemed to remember something and continued, “Oh right, Great Zao, the Great Witch Doctor doesn’t seem to be dead.” ”

“Ye Zao was not surprised. “I know. Other than him, there are other people.” ”

“Are you saying that a traitor has appeared in the Ye family base?”Yi Ling asked.

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly. “I came back this time to find out the truth.”

“”Great Zao, where have you been these days? Also, how did you become like this?”Yi Ling asked immediately. ”

This kind of thing could not be explained clearly in a few words.

“Ye Zao said concisely, “I have been on Earth these days. As for the rest of the matters, I will explain them to you slowly after I have settled the matters in front of me.” ”

“Alright.”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Oh right, I heard that the general election is coming soon?” ”

“Yes.”Yi Ling nodded. “There are three more days until the general election.”

“Ye Zhuo looked out of the window and continued, “You rest well here. I’ll go out for a while.” ”

There were three more days until the general election. She still had more important things to do.

“Yi Ling immediately hugged ye Zhuo’s neck. “Da Zhuozhuo, I’ll go with you.” ”

She was afraid that ye Zao would go away and never come back.
