Old Mrs. Lin only spent ten minutes to let the shareholders of the Lin Group know about her falling out with Lin Jincheng.

“After the phone call, she returned to the apartment. ”

“”Grandma, you’re back.” ”

Feng Xianxian walked out of the bathroom with her pajamas. “These are the pajamas I prepared for you. They’ve already been washed and dried. You can just take a shower and change into them tonight.”

“”Okay, thank you, Xianxian.”Old Lady Lin took the pajamas. ”

“Feng Xianxian smiled and said, “Grandma, we already said that we’re family. Why are you still so polite to me?” ”

“Old Lady Lin smiled and said, “Xianxian, you’re right. We’re all family. It’s too distant to say thank you.” ”

“At this point, Old Lady Lin held onto Feng Xianxian’s hand and sighed. “Xianxian, you’re the only one who treats me well now.” ”

“Feng Xianxian patted old lady Lin’s hand, “Grandma, I believe that Uncle Lin will definitely come to pick you up tomorrow. No matter what, you’re still her mother.” ”

“At the mention of Lin Jin Cheng, Old Lady Lin’s expression changed. She continued, “Let’s not talk about him! I’m filled with anger when it comes to that unfilial son! That family of four is not good!” ”

“Feng Xianxian said with some guilt, “Actually, this matter is all my fault. If it weren’t for me, you wouldn’t have such a conflict with Uncle Lin and made you suffer so much from me...” ”

“”No, not at all.”Seeing that Feng Xianxian was so sad, old madam Lin quickly comforted her, “Xianxian, you’re a good child. Grandma likes to live with you.” ”

How could living with Feng Xianxian be considered wronged?

The corners of Feng Xianxian’s mouth curled up.

“After saying that, old lady lin continued, “If that unfilial son comes to pick us up this time, I’ll definitely teach him a lesson!” ”

“Feng xianxian lowered her head, “Grandma, when the time comes, you can go back with Uncle Lin. I Won’t go back and cause trouble. Uncle Lin and the others won’t like me.” ”

“”If they dare not accept you, then I’ll live outside for the rest of my life! What should I do with them?”If she really lived outside for the rest of her life, then the LIN Corporation would really be in chaos. ”

Lin Jincheng took such a risk?

Feng Qianqian narrowed her eyes.

“If Lin Jincheng could come and pick up Old Lady Lin, then she wouldn’t need to take such a risky move. ”

In fact.

This matter had indeed caused quite a stir in the LIN Group.

Many old shareholders wanted to use this opportunity to push Lin Jincheng down.

“That afternoon, many shareholders wanted to withdraw their capital. ”

The shares of the Lin group fell by five points in the blink of an eye.

“Lin Jincheng stood in his office and looked downstairs, frowning. ”

“Just then, there was a knock on the door. ”

“Lin Jincheng said, “Come in.” ” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

A few shareholders with gray hair walked in from outside.

“One of the elders said, “Jincheng, it’s not that uncle Wang is making things difficult for you. It’s just that you’ve gone too far! You can sign the withdrawal contract now.” ”

“And mine.”

“This is mine.”

“The few old shareholders had already discussed it. They would withdraw their capital first and wait until the Lin Group was heavily in debt and had no funds to turn over. Then, they would buy the LIN Group back at a low price. ”

“In fact, they had already had this intention long ago, but they had never found an excuse to withdraw their capital. ”

“After all, they were the first people who had followed Old Master Lin to conquer the world. ”

“Old Master Lin had done them a favor. If they betrayed Lin Jincheng, it would be too unpleasant to hear. ”

“Now that Lin Jincheng had chased Old Lady Lin out of the Lin family’s old residence, they could use this as an excuse to do what they had long wanted to do. ”

“Lin Jincheng raised his head to look at the shareholders, “Uncle Zhou, you and the other uncles have followed my father all the way here. Now that our group is at a critical juncture, if you propose to withdraw your capital at this time, wouldn’t you be watching my father’s hard work go down the drain?” ”

“These few were all major shareholders, and in total, they owned 30% of the shares of the LIN Group. ”

“Right now, the LIN Group was trying to open up a foreign market. If these few shareholders succeeded in withdrawing their capital, it would be a disaster for the Lin Group! ”

“Uncle Zhou took a step forward, “Jin Cheng, since you’re unwilling to bring your mother back from Feng Xianxian’s place, there’s no point in saying anything else. Since the few of us have opened this door today, we’ve already made preparations. You should sign the contract.” ”

Lin Jin Cheng looked at Uncle Zhou. “Do you have to be so ruthless?”
