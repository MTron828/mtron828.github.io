Chapter 1150: 249: face-smacking Zhao Xueyin

Translator: 549690339

“Yes.”Si Lu nodded.

He had indeed underestimated ye Zao.

He felt that ye Zao was arrogant and conceited.

“From the looks of it, Ye Zao was more scheming than anyone else. ”

“Then what do you plan to do next?”Father Zhao lit a cigarette. “I heard that ye Zao has already activated her plan c.”

“The lawyer said, “Her plan can indeed bring benefits to the consortium.” ”

Father Zhao narrowed his eyes and exhaled a puff of smoke. “Yes! I’ve seen it too!”

“The lawyer knew what Father Zhao was worried about and continued, “Uncle, don’t worry. No matter how well ye Zao is doing now, when the time comes, he can only make a wedding dress for Xueyin!” ”

This was also the reason why the lawyer chose to support ye Zao at that time.

Since there was no problem with Ye Zhuo’s plan.

Then he would use it!

“In the end, the one who would benefit was still Zhao Xueyin. ”

“No matter how much ye Zhuo did, everything would be in vain! ”

“Father Zhao looked at the lawyer. “Ah Lui, I believe that you have such ability!” ”

“Speaking up to this point, Father Zhao took a deep breath, he continued, “The biggest regret in my life is that I can’t have a son. Now that I’m so old, I can’t have another child! From now on, the Zhao family’s business will be yours and Xue Yin’s!”Until now.., father Zhao was quite satisfied with the lawyer. ”

“The lawyer was sensible, capable, and respected him. ”

“If Zhao Xueyin was unable to attract the fifth master’s attention, then her best choice would be the lawyer. ”

As for Jin Ruyu.

According to the information he had.

Jin Ruyu was most likely dead.

“Otherwise, there wouldn’t have been so little activity up until now. ”

“Hearing this, the lawyer was very touched and couldn’t bear it. “Thank you, uncle, for your love.” ”

“Father Zhao continued, “Good child, you are worth it.” ”

Si lui accompanied Father Zhao to say a few more words before leaving the Zhao family home.

Father Zhao looked at the empty living room.

He felt very uncomfortable.

“Thinking back to what Zhao Xueyin had said, he felt even more uncomfortable. ”

“Old Zhang.”

“A moment later, Father Zhao spoke. ”

“The Butler, Old Zhang, walked in from outside. “Master.” ”

“Have there been any results recently?”Father Zhao asked.

Old Zhang shook his head. “No.”

Father Zhao sighed. “It’s been more than 30 years. I wonder if a ye is still alive.”

“The Butler, Old Zhang, did not know how to console father Zhao. ”

“Father Zhao continued, “I’m afraid that this child, Xueyin, is no longer reliable.” ”

“Old Zhang hurriedly said, “Master, Miss is so outstanding and sensible. She definitely won’t let you down.” ”

“You don’t understand.”Father Zhao shook his head.

“Ever since he heard Zhao Xueyin’s words today, Father Zhao’s heart had turned cold. ”

He had mixed feelings.

“After his wife left, he had raised Zhao Xueyin by himself. ”

Only his wife knew that she had a physical defect.

He didn’t know where Zhao Xueyin had heard these ridiculous words!

“Old Zhang continued, “Miss is still young. Sometimes when children talk, they don’t think too much. Just say what you have to say. Don’t be calculative with her.” ”

“Young?”Father Zhao’s eyes revealed a self-deprecating look.

“If Zhao Xueyin was really young, then so be it. ”

But Zhao Xueyin was already 26 years old this year!

Was she still young?

“Father Zhao raised his head to look at the butler. “Old Zhang, do you think a ye is still alive?” ”

This question was really difficult for old Zhang to answer.

It had already been 31 years.

Who knew if that child was still in the world!

“Even in the world, China was so big that Father Zhao could still find it. ”

“If he could find it, he wouldn’t have waited until now. ”

“”He’s alive, the young master is definitely still alive!”Under the current situation, the housekeeper could only comfort Father Zhao. “Master, you have to be well. Don’t think too much. Just wait for the young master to come back at home.” ”

That’s right.

Father Zhao had another child.

That was the child he had with his fiancée.

“After that, too many things happened. ”

His fiancée was gone.

The child was also gone.

“At that time, the child was only one year old. ”

“Later on, Father Zhao married Ma Jiaxin, the daughter of a wealthy family. ”

Unfortunately.

Ma Jiaxin was a short-lived person.

“The child was only born a few days ago, but he was already gone. ”

“Whenever father Zhao thought about that child, he would feel extremely uncomfortable. ”

He could not breathe.

Perhaps he was destined to be childless!

“Father Zhao continued, “Old Zhang, help me keep an eye on that area during this period of time. If there’s any situation, follow up immediately.” ”

Situation?

What situation could there be?

“It had already been so many years. If there was any situation, why would he have to wait until now? ”

Father Zhao had done so much just for the sake of psychological comfort.

“Although that was what he thought, Old Zhang did not say it directly. “Don’t worry, master. I will definitely follow up in time.” ”Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m
