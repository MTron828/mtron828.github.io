Chapter 186: 087: so it’s Ye Zao! Old Mrs. Cen is trying to trick Cen Shaoqing! 6

Old Mrs. Cen became more and more excited as she spoke.

Cen Shaoqing only felt a ball of anger in his heart and couldn’t get out no matter how hard he tried.

He didn’t know why he was angry.

In short, he was angry.

He wanted to hit someone!

“Suit yourself.”After saying this, Cen Shaoqing turned around and left.

Old Mrs. Cen snorted lightly at Cen Shaoqing’s back.

Just you wait, Kid!

The car was about to flip over!

Cen Shaoqing had just returned to the hall when he saw ye Zhuo and Zhou Zeyan standing together, talking and laughing.

To be precise, there was Zhou Xiang between the two of them.

But Cen Shaoqing had automatically blocked Zhou Xiang.

Cen Shaoqing held the Buddha bead in his hand and walked casually to Zhou Zeyan’s side. He said slowly, “Zeyan.”

......

Zhou Zeyan immediately straightened his back. “I’m here.”

“I heard from my aunt that you’ve been studying combat recently. Coincidentally, I studied it when I was young. Why Don’t we go upstairs and Spar?”

Zhou Xiang looked at Cen Shaoqing strangely.

What was up with this child today?

Why was he suddenly so enthusiastic towards Zhou Zeyan?

Zhou Zeyan almost stuttered. “I... I think it’s better to forget it...”

Sparring with Cen Shaoqing?

He did not want to die young yet.

What was wrong with his eldest cousin today?

Zhou Zeyan reflected on himself very seriously.

Cen Shaoqing patted Zhou Zeyan’s shoulder. “Don’t be nervous. I’m just a dabbler and haven’t learned much. I might not be a match for you at all.”

With that said, Zhou Zeyan relaxed a lot. He had been practicing combat for three years!

Even if he couldn’t beat Cen Shaoqing, he would still be beaten up. Who knows, Cen Shaoqing might even become his defeated opponent. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Thus, he followed Cen Shaoqing’s footsteps.

Zhou Xiang looked at the backs of the two people and asked with some doubt, “What happened to Shaoqing today?”

Old Mrs. Cen said with a serious face, “Maybe it’s because the two cousins have a deep relationship!”

What happened?

What else could it be?

She was jealous!

Old Mrs. Cen covered her mouth and snickered.

Zhou Xiang was even more confused. “Mom, What Are You Laughing At?”

Old Mrs. Cen immediately let go of her hand and said seriously, “I’m not laughing!”

After saying that, she stuck a lychee into a fork and handed it to Ye Zhuo. “Yezi, eat more lychees. They’re sweet!”

Zhou Xiang frowned slightly.

He didn’t know what Old Lady Cen was up to.

Cen Shaoqing paid great attention to his health. Not only did he soak the lychee in a Thermos Cup, there was also a gym on the second floor of the side hall that was more than 100 square meters.

The two of them came to the gym.

Zhou Zeyan looked at the environment of the gym and sighed in his heart. His eldest cousin, a capitalist, was living quite disciplined.

“Catch.”Cen Shaoqing threw over a pair of boxing gloves.

Zhou Zeyan reached out to receive them and put on the boxing gloves.

Standing in the middle of the room, the two of them gave each other a samurai salute before the fight began.

Then, Zhou Zeyan regretted it.

He shouldn’t have agreed to Cen Shaoqing’s challenge.

He shouldn’t have secretly thought that he could win Cen Shaoqing.

Zhou Zeyan only had one feeling now.

Pain!

All the bones in his body were in pain.

He was going to fall apart!

“I can’t do it! I Can’t do it!”Zhou Zeyan sat down on the ground and raised his hands. “I surrender! I surrender!”

“The world is not dead yet, I won’t surrender even if I Die! A man should be a man, Get Up!”Cen Shaoqing looked down at Zhou Zeyan.

“Cousin, I really can’t do it anymore!”Zhou Zeyan was about to cry. If this continued, he really wouldn’t be able to stand up. “Please spare me!”

“Is that all you’ve Got?”Cen Shaoqing raised his eyebrows slightly.

Zhou Zeyan took off his gloves. “Cousin, it should be time to eat. Let’s go downstairs.”

Cen Shaoqing raised his head to look at the clock hanging on the wall. His thin lips parted slightly. “Let’s go.”

Zhou Zeyan felt as if he had been pardoned. He immediately got up from the ground and followed Cen Shaoqing’s footsteps.

When he saw the two of them coming over.

Zhou xiang smiled and said, “Have you guys finished sparring? It’s almost time to eat. I was just about to send someone to call you guys! Oh right, who won just now?”

“Cousin is too amazing!”Zhou Zeyan said, “How can my small arms and legs be a match for him?”

Cen Shaoqing patted Zhou Zeyan’s shoulder. “Zeyan is too young! If he practices for a few more decades, he might still have a chance to beat me.”

Zhou Zeyan:”...”a few, a few decades?

During dinner, Granny Cen deliberately arranged for Zhou Zeyan to sit next to ye Zao.

There were five people at the table.

Cen Shaoqing happened to sit opposite Zhou Zeyan.

Granny cen said deliberately, “Zeyan, I remember that you are 21 years old this year, right?”

“Yes.”Zhou Zeyan nodded.

Granny cen smiled and said, “Have you found a girlfriend at school?”
