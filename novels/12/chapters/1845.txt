Translator: 549690339

She wasn’t being selfish. This was a normal reaction of a mother.

“Father Yu walked over and reached out his hands to hug Tian Zhifang. “Zhifang, Respect Zifei’s choice. In this world, there will always be someone who will carry a heavy load for the people.” ”

Tian Zhifang choked out her sobs. She was extremely sorrowful.

Father Yu patted Tian Zhifang’s back and looked up at Yu Zifei. He gave Yu Zifei a reassuring look.

“The father and son looked at each other. Everything was said without words. At this moment, silence was better than words. ”

“Tian Zhifang’s emotions were appeased by Father Yu. She walked up to Yu Zifei and said in a hoarse voice, “Zifei, if you want to chase your dream, I Won’t Stop You. But you have to promise me one thing.” ”

“Yu Zifei looked at Tian Zhifang and said, “Please speak.” ”

“Tian Zhifang looked at Yu Zifei and said, “No matter when or what happens, you have to think of your father and me! Your father and I will always be at home waiting for you to come back.” ”

“”Okay.”Yu Zifei nodded. “Don’t worry, I will.” ”

Tian Zhifang took a deep breath and picked up the empty bowl beside her. “You have a good rest. I’m leaving first.”

“When she turned around, father Yu patted Yu Zifei on the shoulder. ”

“Looking at his parents leaving, Yu Zifei didn’t know how to feel. ”

An hour later.

Father Yu came to Yu Zifei’s room alone.

“Zifei.”

“Father.”Yu Zifei immediately stood up from his chair.

“Father Yu smiled and said, “I’ve already pacified your mother. You Don’t have to worry.” ”

“”Father, thank you.”At this moment, other than saying thank you, Yu Zifei could not find any other suitable words. ”

“”Why are we father and son talking about this?”Father Yu took a few steps forward, then he said, “Zifei, work hard with Miss Ye. No matter what the end result is, father will not regret his decision today. Father also hopes that you will not leave any regrets in your life.” ”

Father Yu’s greatest regret was that he did not become a soldier.

“That year, Yu Zifei’s grandmother forced him to not participate with her death. ”

“Later on, seeing his good friend become a major military officer, Father Yu could only be envious. ”

“Other than envy, there was more regret. ”

“If he had been braver and more decisive, or if someone had stood up and said something on his behalf, he might have been able to turn things around. ”

Unfortunately.

No.

“After missing the conscription, father Yu regretted it every day. ”

“There was everything in this world, but there was no medicine for regret. ”

“Now, he could not let his son follow his old path. ”

“”En, don’t worry, I will definitely not leave any regrets for myself,”Yu Zifei said. ”

“Father Yu nodded and stood up. “Alright, that’s it then! You Go Ahead, I’m leaving!” ”

Yu Zifei sent Father Yu out.

“He took a few steps forward and seemed to have thought of something. Father Yu turned back again and said, “Zifei.” ” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“What’s Wrong?”Yu Zifei asked.

“Father Yu continued, “It’s been a while since you broke up with Zhang Pandi. Your Mother asked me to ask you, you...” ”

“Yu Zifei smiled and said, “Does my mother want to ask if I have a new girlfriend now?” ”

“Yes.”Father Yu nodded.

“Yu Zifei said, “Not yet.”He was too busy with work, and there were not many women in the department, so he had not made any progress. ”

“The most important thing was that he had broken up with Zhang Pandi less than a year ago, so he could not quickly enter the next relationship. ”

“Father Yu continued, “Your mother said that she wants her former colleague’s daughter to introduce to you. The woman has just returned from studying abroad. All aspects are very good. Do you want to consider it?” ”

“Okay.”Yu Zifei nodded.

“He had just rejected Tian Zhifang’s withdrawal from the OASIS project. If he refused to go on a blind date again, Tian Zhifang would definitely be very angry! ”

“At this time, even if Yu Zifei did not want to go on a blind date, he could only nod his head and agree. ”

“Seeing him nod his head, father yu smiled and said, “That’s right! You should have mentioned a partner earlier and given birth to a child for your mother to take care of. Your mother wouldn’t have to worry about you all day long!” ”

“En.”Yu Zifei continued to nod.

“Father Yu sighed, then he said, “If you want to blame someone, you can only blame Zhang Pandi for not being fated with you. This time, Miss Ye gave you a three-month leave. If you and Zhang Pandi didn’t break up, you can take advantage of this time to hold the wedding!” ”

A normal marriage leave was only half a month.

Three months could do a lot of things!

“Unfortunately, Zhang Panti was too small-minded and short-sighted. ”

“Yu Zifei said, “Let’s not talk about the past anymore! When are we going to arrange the blind date? I’ll free up my time in advance.” ”
