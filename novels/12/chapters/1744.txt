Talk alone?

Talk alone about what?

“Professor Feng and director Ma had sacrificed their lives in Europa. At this time, Jamila came knocking on his door. It was obvious why he was here. ”

“Gu si said, “I don’t think we have anything to talk about!” ”

“”Miss Gu, do you have a misunderstanding about me?”Jamila continued, “I will only take ten minutes of your time. If you still feel that there is nothing to talk about with me after ten minutes, I will leave immediately.” ”

Gu Si glanced at Jamila. There were so many people here. It wouldn’t look good if she continued to be in a stalemate with Jamila.

Jamila immediately made a ‘please’gesture.

Gu Si raised her foot and walked forward.

Jamila followed Gu Si’s footsteps.

The two of them walked to the cafe next door and found a seat to sit down.

The waiter went forward to order.

Gu Si looked up. “A glass of lemonade will do.”

“After saying that, she looked at Jamila. “What do you want to say?” ”

Jamila ordered a cup of coffee and smiled. “Professor Feng has often mentioned you in front of us before. She said that you are the foundation she is most proud of.”

Gu Si smiled slightly. “Thank you for the compliment. But you must have heard wrongly. The foundation that the teacher is most proud of is Liu Yuan.”

Gu Si knew her own strength very well. She was not the kind of person who could not find her own strength just because someone complimented her.

“Although professor Feng also appreciated her, he was still far from Liu Yuan. ”

“”Miss Gu is too modest,”Jamila continued, “Professor Feng has indeed mentioned you many times in front of me. She also said that it was her greatest regret that you did not go to C Nation with her.” ”

“Gu si chuckled, “Is that your real goal?” ”

“If professor Feng had really said that, his target should have been Liu Yuan, not her. ”

“”Because teacher Feng was sacrificed, no one in C Nation has mastered the light speed technology, so you came to find me? Why, do I look like the kind of person who is prone to betrayal?” ”

“Jamila took a sip of coffee to ease the awkwardness, “No, you misunderstood.” ”

Gu Si kept a smile on her face. “Misunderstanding? Then why did you come here? To have coffee with me?” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“”Miss Gu, we came to find you to make professor Feng Feel at ease.”Jamila paused and continued, “After all, you were the disciple that Professor Feng missed the most before he left for Europe.” ”

These words were too perfect to pick out any mistakes.

“”I’m not the only disciple that teacher Feng Misses, am I? Have you gone to look for Liu Yuan?”Gu Si asked. ”

“Jamila smiled. “Miss Gu, not everyone is worthy of me looking for them personally!” ”

This meant that Liu Yuan was not as good as Gu si.

“If it were anyone else, they would definitely be very happy to hear this. ”

“Gu Si was the same. A faint smile appeared on the corner of her mouth. She said in a flattered manner, “Thank you for your kindness, Mr. Jamila.” ”

Gamila observed the change in Gu Si’s expression without batting an eyelid.

“Seeing the flattered look in Gu Si’s eyes, a hint of sarcasm appeared on Gamila’s face. ”

He had thought that there was something different about Gu si.

It turned out that she was just like everyone else.

That cold look just now was just an act.

“”You’re welcome,”gamila continued, “It’s just that Miss GU holds a high position in Professor Feng’s heart. It has nothing to do with me. I’m just passing on Professor Feng’s meaning. Miss Gu, professor Feng sincerely hopes that you can go to C Nation to develop yourself.” ”

“At this point, Jamila paused, then she added, “Miss Gu, don’t worry. After you arrive in C Nation, we’ll definitely not mistreat you. The treatment we’ll give you will definitely surpass that of Hua Nation. “Oh right, this is the place our doctor arranged for you to stay. Do you think you’re satisfied?” ”

Jamila took out a document and placed it in front of Gu si.

“Gu Si flipped through it, and the smile in her eyes became more and more obvious. ”

“Jamila narrowed her eyes and continued, “Miss Gu, this villa has a total of more than a thousand square meters. It’s definitely not a problem for your family to live in it. In addition, we’ve also arranged for a servant, a driver, and a chef for you.” ”

“For someone like Gu Si, having a servant, a driver, and a chef was an unimaginable life. ”

The current gu si must be bursting with joy!

“There was a saying in China that went, “If you fly on a branch, you become a Phoenix.”. ”

This saying was very suitable for the current gu si.

“Gu Si nodded, she continued, “Then what about my family? The reason why you came to find me, you should have a clear understanding of my situation, right? I’m the eldest sister at home. My parents, including my younger siblings, all live with me. I Can’t abandon them and go live in C country alone.” ”
