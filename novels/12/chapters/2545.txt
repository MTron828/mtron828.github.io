Vivi shook her head.

“Doctor Wang looked at Vivi. “Vivi, don’t you want to recover?” ”

“”I’m tired,”Vivi said. “Doctor Wang, if this is a surgery that I’m not confident in, why don’t we save our manpower and resources and save these resources for those who need them?” ”

“Doctor Wang continued, “Although I’m not 100% confident, I’m still 50% confident. Vivi, please cherish this opportunity.” ”

Weiwei still shook her head. Her desire to live had disappeared the day doctor Wang told her the truth.

She was now a puppet without a soul.

Life and death meant nothing to her.

“Xiang Weiwei!”Doctor Wang raised his voice.

But Weiwei still did not react.

“”Xiang Weiwei, since you have the hope of being born, why don’t you hold on to it? What do you want to Do?”Doctor Wang asked. ”

Weiwei still did not have any reaction.

Doctor Wang frowned. He had never seen such a patient. He was helpless!

“In a moment, doctor Wang left the ward. ”

“He had to get Weiwei to cooperate with the treatment. After all, this was his only chance to prove himself to everyone. ”

“But now that Weiwei did not cooperate, he had no choice but to go back and think of a way. ”

“When he returned home, he saw that doctor Wang was wearing a worried look on his face. Mother Wang asked, “Jun Jun, did you encounter something troublesome again?” ”

Doctor Wang sighed and told his mother what had happened.

Mother Wang narrowed her eyes. “That little girl really doesn’t know what’s good for her!”

“Doctor Wang was kind enough to save her, but she actually treated her like a donkey’s liver! ”

“Did you just say that she’s not an adult yet?”Mother Wang seemed to have thought of something and turned to look at Doctor Wang.

“Hearing this, doctor Wang nodded. “She’s not an adult yet.” ”

“”Since she’s not an adult, then let her guardian sign it!”Mother Wang continued, “What kind of decision can a little girl make!” ”

These words immediately reminded Doctor Wang. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Although Weiwei was not under the care of her parents, that was because her parents did not know about Weiwei’s situation. If one of them knew that Weiwei was now a famous cartoonist, they would definitely fight for the custody of Weiwei. ”

“”Mom, you’re Right!”Dr. Wang happily grabbed his mother’s shoulder. “Thank you! I know what to do!” ”

“Mother Wang smiled and said, “This child, there’s no need to thank me!” ”

“At this moment, Zhang Hong walked out of the room with a troubled look on her face. “Dajun, are you really going to treat that patient? Are You Confident?”Zhang Hong looked at the comments of the netizens, as well as the comments of the professionals on this matter, she became more and more worried. ”

“For ordinary people, it was not easy for doctor Wang to get to where he was today. He was already the chief physician of a key tertiary grade a hospital. As long as this surgery failed, doctor Wang’s future would be ruined. ”

“No matter which angle one looked at it from, this was a dangerous thing! ”

“”Don’t worry, there’s no problem.”Doctor Wang was very confident in himself. “The person you should be worried about is Miss Ye.” ”

“Zhang Hong looked at Doctor Wang and continued, “Dajun, I don’t know much about your work either, but I know about Miss Ye’s influence in the medical world. I always feel that I have to listen to miss ye on this matter. After all, Miss Ye has the qualifications...” ”

“Before she could finish her sentence, she was directly interrupted by Doctor Wang. “You mean I don’t have the qualifications? Zhang Hong, what have I Been to you all these years? !” ”

“At this point, doctor Wang immediately broke down and shouted angrily. ”

“Seeing her son like this, mother Wang also did not feel good, she looked at Zhang Hong and said, “Zhang Hong, it’s been so many years. Other than pouring cold water on the military, can’t you give him an encouragement?”No wonder people said that it was better to marry a good wife than to marry a good wife like Zhang Hong, it was better not to. ”

“Zhang Hong also realized that her words were a little harsh, she continued, “Mom, I don’t mean to throw cold water on him. I just feel that the army is taking too much risk by doing this. He is already a chief physician now. Compared to him, he is much better. All the relatives in the family are envious of him having a good job!” ”

“They were all forty plus people, and they were already past the age of taking risks. ”

“”That’s why the military hasn’t had much success all these years because of you!”The queen mother continued, “As a wife, if you don’t believe in your husband, who do you expect to believe in the military! Zhang Hong, you’ve really gone too far!” ”
