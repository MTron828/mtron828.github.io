Chapter 24: Meet His Match

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“What’s going on? Why are you panicking?” Cen Shaoqing looked like he had just woken up. He had black silk pajamas hanging down loosely with a rubber waistline at his waist. His firm abdomen and six-packs could be seen clearly.

Even a man like Li Qiandong could not help but gasp in astonishment upon seeing Cen Shaoqing’s figure. Nevertheless, he could not care about expressing his astonishment now. He said eagerly, “Brother Fifth, the CIS project has been completed.”

Upon hearing that, the usually calm and composed Cen Shaoqing had a change in his expression. “Show me.”

Li Qiandong proceeded to pass the laptop to Cen Shaoqing.

Cen Shaoqing opened the laptop and narrowed his eyes. “Who did this?”

“It’s that novice, Niohuru.” Li Qiandong continued to speak, “Frankly, I really didn’t expect Niohuru to be an expert….”

This person was truly an expert. The hundreds of staff members in Cen Enterprises did not manage to solve it; yet, Niohuru managed to do it in less than three days. It was truly impressive!

Cen Shaoqing carried the laptop with one hand, and his other hand moved the cursor on the touchpad. “Inform the others to begin a video conference in ten minutes.”

“Alright.” It was a rare occasion for Li Qiandong, who had been used to being carefree, to turn serious at once. He took the laptop from Cen Shaoqing and walked in the direction of his room.

Meanwhile, Cen Shaoqing went to the dressing room and got dressed.

Even though he was dressed formally, his wardrobe mainly consisted of Chinese-style robes. The colors were all very plain and clean.

Ten minutes later, the video conference began on the dot.

Even with a screen between them, a glance from the person in the display was enough to send shivers down one’s spine.

Two hours later, the video conference ended at last.

Cen Shaoqing picked up the teacup and took a sip. He moved the prayer bead in his hand as usual and assumed a carefree mannerism. “Look into the Niohuru person.”

Li Qiandong was stunned for a moment and asked, “What Niohuru person?”

Upon saying that, Li Qiandong reacted to the situation quickly and added, “Sure, I’ll send someone to look into this matter.”

Cen Enterprises had a large assembly of talented men. There was certainly no lack of outstanding internet-savvy geeks.

Three years ago, Cen Enterprises had even recruited the renowned Hacker W to serve its cause.

Under normal circumstances, W would only need ten minutes to get to the bottom of his target’s family background. However, it was different today.

A few hours had passed, yet there was no update from W.

Li Qiandong sent a WeChat message to urge him.

After a long wait, W finally replied, ‘The person’s firewall is too strong. Give me more time.’

Li Qiandong was stunned for a moment before he typed his reply, ‘Is this really W?’

The message had only just been sent when a video call came in.

Li Qiandong tapped on the phone to pick it up, and W’s face was displayed on the screen.

“F*ck! It is you in the flesh! I was still under the assumption that it was someone else!” Who would have thought that the renowned W would encounter a problem too? DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

It seemed that Niohuru was more impressive than he had imagined!

W put on a long face. “Brother Li, who is this person that you assigned me to investigate, huh? I’ve already switched two computers!” It was W’s first time encountering such an impressive opponent. Not only did he not manage to hack into the opponent’s data, but on the contrary, he was blocked twice.

It was too exhilarating!

In fact, W had even thought that he was in a dream.

He had been doing this for so many years. Even if he was not the top hacker in the hacker world, he was one of the best at his job. He never imagined that he would encounter a worthy opponent today.

Li Qiandong replied, “It’s a very impressive expert! Call me when you have answers.”

“Alright.” W hung up the video call.

W was very interested in this impressive expert now that he met his match. He went to look into the expert again after hanging up the video call.

Li Qiandong had just turned off his phone when the sound of someone knocking on his door was heard. “Mr. Li, Master Cen is asking for you.”

“Coming.”

Li Qiandong answered before he headed off to meet Cen Shaoqing.

“Any results?” Cen Shaoqing was seated on the executive chair with a tea set placed in front of him. While speaking, his pair of beautiful hands shuffled through the tea utensils leisurely. The puff of vapor emitted from the tea set off his delicate facial features and enshrouded it with a layer of mistiness.

Li Qiandong shook his head and said in schadenfreude, “Not yet. W managed to meet his match this time. Do you have any idea how unpleasant W’s expression was earlier? It was really amusing….”

Cen Shaoqing furrowed his brows ever so slightly upon hearing what Li Qiandong said.

He was well aware of W’s capability. When he found out that Niohuru completed the CIS project, he sensed that the person was no ordinary man. Nonetheless, he had never expected that the person would still surpass his expectations.

Li Qiandong talked for a long time and noticed that his throat was parched. He looked around the room and asked, “Brother Fifth, do you have mineral water in your room?”

The reason he asked for mineral water was not because he did not enjoy tea. Instead, it was because Cen Shaoqing was not fond of others touching his tea set.

In fact, this did not only apply to his tea set... he was not fond of letting anyone touch anything that belonged to him, including his dear mother.

Cen Shaoqing was an eccentric man who was prone to frequently changing moods just a few years ago. However, his temperament became much better after he began practicing Buddhism and vegetarianism.

Nevertheless, despite his improvements, he still did not manage to change his strange habit of disliking others touching his belongings.

Cen Shaoqing took out a bottle of mineral water from the drawer and passed it to him.

Li Qiandong received it with both his hands.

Then, Cen Shaoqing said, “If W is unable to find anything, leave it to the international division then.”

Li Qiandong nodded. “Alright.”

Li Qiandong left the room and logged on to the international tech website to leave a comment for Niohuru. ‘Expert! Expert! Can we add each other as friends on WeChat, please?’

The expert was obviously online yet did not reply even after a long while.

Li Qiandong felt confused in his heart. Could it be that the expert was upset about something? Did the expert blame him for deleting her friend request previously?

The more Li Qiandong thought about it, the more panicked he became.

He hastily typed out a message to apologize to the expert, ‘I’m sorry, expert. It was my fault for accidentally deleting your previous friend request because of my butterfingers. I really didn’t do that on purpose. A great man rarely stoops to pettiness or harbors grievances for past wrongs; I am sure you’re a magnanimous person, so please forgive me this time!’

‘Expert, I’m kneeling before you.’

‘Expert….’

Li Qiandong sent a lot of consecutive messages to the expert, yet the expert did not reply. In the end, he decided to give up because there was nothing else he could do. After browsing for a bit, he arrived at the forum’s page.

He could see that the entire forum was discussing Niohuru.YZ.

In fact, some people changed the prefix of their names to Niohuru to worship the mogul.

Ye Zhuo had gone to take a shower when the messages came through. She did not expect that someone would have sent her so many messages in such a short time.

She took a quick glance and realized that she did not fail in adding the person as a friend previously, but it was the person on the other end who deleted her.

Nevertheless, Ye Zhuo was not the kind of person who cared about such details. She gently tapped the screen with her fingertips and replied, ‘It’s fine.’

After receiving the text message sent by Ye Zhuo, Li Qiandong was under the assumption that his vision was blurred. He hastily rubbed his eyes a few times and confirmed that it was not a delusion before he hastily replied, “You’re truly a good man, expert!”

‘Oh right, expert, can I add you as a friend on WeChat?’

Ye Zhuo was uninterested in having a stranger get closer to her, so she replied, ‘You can talk to me here.’

This expert behaved just like an expert would!

He replied with such a personality.

Meanwhile, Ye Zhuo suddenly heard voices from outside her room. Was there a guest in the house?

Ye Zhuo raised an eyebrow and closed her laptop casually. Then, she got dressed and walked into the living room.

There, she saw two people that she had never seen before.

One of them was a middle-aged woman who was slightly older than Ye Shu, and the other was a young female. In total, three people were seated on the sofa chatting.

Noticing Ye Zhuo’s arrival, Ye Shu hastily stood up and said, “Zhuo Zhuo is here! Come quick, this is Auntie Lian, and this is Shasha.”

The guest was Ye Shu’s best friend who grew up with her, and her name was Zhou Yuelian. Even though they were not biological siblings, they were closer than real siblings.

Over the years, Ye Shu owed it to Zhou Yuelian for her financial assistance.

Ye Shu’s two biological sisters could not even measure up to half of Zhou Yuelian.

The female next to Zhou Yuelian was her daughter, Lin Shasha.

Lin Shasha was 20 years old this year, and she had very beautiful facial features as well as a head full of long, curly hair. She was a very enthusiastic girl.

Ye Zhuo greeted them respectfully, “Auntie Lian, Shasha.”

Zhou Yuelian stood up. “Shu, is this your daughter, Zhuo Zhuo?”

Ye Shu nodded. “Yes.”

Zhou Yuelian held Ye Zhuo’s hand and sized her up meticulously. Her eyes were filled with surprise and awe. After a long while, she said with reddened eyes, “Shu, she looks just like you! She looks just like you! Zhuo Zhuo looks like you!”

Ye Zhuo’s face was indeed 50% similar to Ye Shu’s while 30% was similar to… that man from back in those years. Nevertheless, Zhou Yuelian would never allow herself to say that aloud.
