“Chapter 2005: 420: Trash! Miss ye will always be here, believing in more than one thing! 1”

“Ye Zhuo saw through Yi Ling’s worries at a glance and reached out to pat its head. “Don’t worry, I Won’t leave you behind.” ”

“”No, I want to go with you.”Yi Ling hugged ye Zhuo’s neck and refused to let go. ”

It did not want to experience those hellish days a second time.

It was too terrifying.

“Now, as long as Yi Ling closed her eyes, those experiences would appear in front of her eyes. ”

Only by staying by ye Zao’s side would she feel at ease.

“Okay.”Ye Zao opened his backpack. “Then come in!”

“Yay! Long live burning!”Yi Ling excitedly kissed ye Zao’s face and then went into the bag.

This bag was made of special materials and could shrink at will.

Ye Zao carried the bag on his back and his slender figure disappeared into the thick darkness of the night.

He walked until he stopped in front of an aircraft.

This was an abandoned aircraft.

“Yi Ling stuck her head out of the bag and said with a frown, “Da Zao Zao, you don’t want to fly this aircraft, do you?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“”This, this, this is okay?”This aircraft seemed to have been abandoned for at least ten years. ”

Ye Zao took out his tools. “It can still be used after modification.”

“Yi Ling continued, “Why don’t you use Imperial Wind?” ”

Imperial Wind was ye Zao’s special aircraft.

“Ever since ye Zao’s accident, Imperial Wind had been in an unmanned state. ”

That was because no one in changyue could control imperial wind.

“”I can’t use it yet,”ye Zao said. ”

“She had just returned and had not investigated everything clearly. If she used imperial wind rashly, she would definitely alert the enemy. ”

This was also the reason why ye Zao had been using a mask to show off.

“At this time, Yi Ling also understood ye Zao’s intentions. She continued, “Great Zao Zao, let me help you!” ”

“Although Yi Ling was only a battle suit, it had the talent of repairing an aircraft. ”

“No need. You Go back and rest. I will be fine by myself.”

Yi Ling flew out of her bag and was mercilessly slapped back by Ye Zao. “Stay in your bag and be obedient.”

“Okay.”Yi Ling retracted her head again.

Yi Ling was really too tired during this period of time. She did not stay in her bag for long before falling asleep.

“During this period of time, ye Zao had been repairing the aircraft. ”

He did not know how much time had passed.

“Yi Ling stretched out her cute little head and looked at ye Zao. “Great burning, has the aircraft been repaired?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao brushed the hair on his forehead to the back of his head. “It’s almost done.”

“Yi Ling flew out of her bag and looked at the worn-out aircraft. She frowned and said, “Great Zao, are you sure this thing can fly?” ”

Why did it feel that it was a little risky?

“This aircraft was probably given to scavengers, and scavengers would not even want it. ”

“It can definitely fly.”Ye Zao pressed the Start button.

— the aircraft has been successfully activated.

— please set the target landing location.

Ye Zao entered the target location.

“The next second, the aircraft flew out like an arrow that had left the bowstring. ”

“Holy shit! It really works!”Yi Ling said in surprise.

“After saying that, Yi Ling said a little worriedly, “It won’t crash, right?” ”

“Can’t you say something auspicious?”Ye Zao looked back at Yi Ling.

“Yi Ling said, “I’m just a little worried! Oh right, Great Zao, let me ask you something.” ”

“Huh?”Ye Zao operated the aircraft with one hand and pressed the accelerator with the other. There was no extra expression on his handsome face.

“Where are we going?”Yi Ling continued to ask.

“Ye Zao said, “Red and Blue Mountain.” ”

“”Red and Blue Mountain?”Yi Ling asked curiously, “Why are we going to red and Blue Mountain?” ”

“To fight monsters.”Ye Zao’s tone was indifferent. “To level up.”

To fight monsters and level up?

What did he mean?

Could it be that ye Zao was preparing for the election?

The most important thing now was to tell the people at the Ye family base that Ye Zao was not dead?

“Once ye Zao appeared, Qiu Di would not be able to sit in that position. ”

“However, ye Zao did not seem to have any intention of showing up. ”

What did ye Zao Want?

“Yi Ling nodded her head, not fully understanding. ” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The weather in Changyue was not very good. The aircraft had not flown in the clouds for long before a strong acid rain fell.

“After the rain, a gorgeous rainbow appeared in the clouds. ”

It was not quite the same as the rainbow on Earth.

“The rainbow in Changyue was very dazzling, as if it was inlaid with gemstones. When the sunlight shone on the rainbow, it refracted seven-colored rays of light, making it difficult for people to open their eyes. ”

“About half an hour later, the aircraft stopped on the red and blue mountain range. ”

Ye Zhuo opened the cabin door and walked out.

“”Great burning, are we here?”Yi Ling jumped out of her bag. ”
