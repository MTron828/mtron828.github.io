“Special assistant feng continued, “Over at the south city construction site...””

“Song Shiyu narrowed his eyes and interrupted special assistant Feng’s unfinished sentence, “Those two old guys haven’t signed yet?””

“”Yes.”Special Assistant Feng nodded. “We’ve tried many ways, but they just don’t want to sign.””

“”I remember that they have a son who is studying abroad, right?””

“Special Assistant Feng was puzzled at first, then nodded. “Their son is called Ning Yongzong, and he is currently taking his postgraduate examination in C Nation.””

“Song Shiyu leaned back in his chair, his eyes narrowed. “Get someone to send some gifts to those two old guys! I think ning Yongzong’s little finger is pretty good.””

Special Assistant Feng was stunned.

Song Shiyu’s tone suddenly turned cold. “Why? Don’t you understand what I’m saying?”

Special Assistant Feng was so scared that his face turned pale. “I understand.”

“You may leave.”Song Shiyu raised his hand.

Special Assistant Feng bent down and walked out of the door.

...

Aunt Lang came to the teahouse that they had agreed on.

The other party was an old man in his sixties or seventies. He had a kind look on his face and looked very amiable.

Aunt Lang walked over and sat across from the old man. “Elder Zhang.”

“Elder Zhang reached out and poured a cup of tea for Aunt Lang. “Lang Hua, I heard from Cao Wei that you’ve already found her for half a month?””

Aunt Lang nodded.

“Then have you ever thought about...”

“Before elder Zhang could finish his sentence, Aunt Lang said, “Elder Zhang, I know what you want to say. Please don’t worry. I Won’t mistake my own daughter.””

“Let’s do another appraisal.”

“Aunt Lang took a sip of water from her cup. After a long while, she nodded. “Okay.””

“Elder Zhang continued, “Lang Hua, I’m sure Cao Wei has already told you about the current internal affairs of the consortium. Come back.””

Aunt Lang shook her head.

Elder Zhang Sighed. “Do you have the heart to watch your father take over the empire just like that?”

“Aunt Lang laughed self-deprecatingly. “Elder Zhang, you’ve seen what I look like now. Do you think I still have the ability to manage a financial group?”She was no different from a cripple now.”

“How would you know if you don’t try?”

“Even a broken ship had 3,000 nails.”

“Moreover, ye Langhua was a talented girl who had made a name for herself in the capital.”

“There’s no need for that.”

Elder Zhang Sighed again when he saw Aunt Lang like this.

The sun was already setting when they came out of the teahouse.

Aunt Lang was walking on the bustling street when she was suddenly stopped by a joyful voice. “Little Langhua! Little Langhua!” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Aunt Lang turned around and saw that it was the old Mrs. Cen who had a head full of beautiful hair.

“Aunt Tang.”

“Old Mrs. Cen jogged over. “Little Langhua, it really is you! I thought I had misjudged you!””

“You’re right.”

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “I heard that Heartless Dog Xi Muwen helped you find Little Half Moon?””

“MMM.”Aunt Lang nodded.

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “I think I saw that heartless dog bringing his little wife around the mall yesterday. Did Little Half Moon wear a white sweater and a black hat yesterday?””

“Yes.”

“Old Mrs. Cen narrowed her eyes. “It’s not that I want to pour cold water on it, but that child doesn’t look like your little half moon at all.””

“”We did an appraisal,”Aunt Lang said.”

“Old Mrs. Cen frowned. “What if that dog Xi Muwen did something inside? Little Lang Hua, you can’t be fooled by that Heartless Dog Again!””

“”Don’t worry, I know what I’m doing.””

“”If you knew, you wouldn’t have been fooled by that bastard back then!”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Little Lang Hua, do you believe that I can bring you to the ditch right now?””

Aunt Lang smiled. “You’re still the same as before.”

“Time passed quickly, but old Mrs. Cen still seemed to be the same old Mrs. Cen.”

She was always carefree and always had a smile on her face.

Old Mrs. Cen looked at Aunt Lang. “Now you’re asking me if I’m a little rabbit.”

“Ah?”Aunt Lang was stunned.

“Quickly ask!”

Aunt Lang could only do as she was told. “Are you a little rabbit?”

“Old Mrs. Cen nodded. “Yes, I’m a cute little rabbit.””

“Then, old Mrs. Cen continued, “Ask me if I’m a Sika Deer Again!””

“Are you a little sika deer?”

“You Idiot!”Old Mrs. Cen was speechless. “I already said that I’m a cute little rabbit!”

Aunt Lang:”...”

“Old Mrs. Cen smiled. “Didn’t you say that you knew? If you knew, how could you be tricked by me? So, Little Lang Hua, don’t be fooled by the scene in front of you. You’ve already been tricked once. Don’t fall for that Bastard XI Muwen’s trick again!””
