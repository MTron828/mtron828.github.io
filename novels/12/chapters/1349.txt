“She refused to believe that Zhou Zuolong, her biological father, could not cure Zhou Xiang! ”

Zhou Xiang had been afraid of Zhou Zuolong since she was young.

“As long as Zhou Zuolong made a sound, she would not dare to speak. ”

“Even after she married into the Cen family, Zhou Xiang still could not get rid of her fear of Zhou Zuolong. ” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Every time Zhou Zuolong spoke, Zhou Xiang would not say a word of No. ”

Zhou Xiang dared to give her a hard time today.

She would let Zhou Zuolong deal with Zhou Xiang.

She wanted to see what Zhou Xiang was capable of!

“Seeing Xie wanqiu like this, Zheng Wanyin was very glad that she did not tell Zhou Zuolong about Xie wanqiu. ”

“If she told Zhou Zuolong, then Xie Wanqiu and she would be finished. ”

“Zheng wanyin continued, “Grandma, are we really going to call Grandpa? Will it not be good if Grandpa knows about this?” ”

Not Good?

What’s not good about it?

“Xie wanqiu continued, “If I ask you to hit me, then hit me! You tell your grandpa that if he doesn’t come and make a decision for me, I’ll be bullied to death by that B * Tch Zhou Xiang!” ”

Xie wanqiu had watched Zhou Xiang grow up.

Xie wanqiu was really shocked that Zhou Xiang had suddenly become like this.

Why did a spineless little B * Tch suddenly become so tough?

“As soon as she finished speaking, Xie wanqiu sighed, “Those who aren’t biological aren’t biological. If I were her biological mother, would she dare to treat me like this today? “To think that I was so good to her normally. If it weren’t for me, would that slut be here? But she’s so good! She repaid kindness with enmity! She completely disregarded the kindness of raising her! An ingrate is an ingrate. No matter how you raise her, she won’t be able to mature!” ”

Zheng Wanyin did not expect Zhou Xiang to be such a person.

There was no such thing as an ingrate in this world.

“No matter what, it was wrong of her to treat Xie wanqiu like that. ”

“If not for Xie wanqiu, would there be Zhou Xiang? ”

Xie Wanqiu was right. Zhou Xiang was an ingrate.

A top-notch ingrate!

“Zheng Wanyin sat beside Xie wanqiu and comforted her, “Grandma, don’t Be Sad...” ”

“Xie wanqiu looked up at Zheng Wanyin. “Yinyin, you’re my biological granddaughter. Everything that Grandma did was for you! So, you must be on Grandma’s side! You Can’t let that B * Tch Zhou Xiang laugh at you!” ”

Zheng Wanyin nodded.

“”Quick, Call Your Grandpa.” ”

Zheng Wanyin took out her phone and called Zhou Zuolong.

The call was quickly connected.

“Grandfather.”Zheng Wanyin’s sobbing voice sounded.

Zheng Wanyin felt wronged.

She really felt wronged.

What did Zhou Xiang’s falling out with Xie wanqiu have to do with her?

But Zhou Xiang blocked her phone and wechat.

What did Zhou Xiang mean by this?

Zhou Xiang clearly did it on purpose!

“When she suddenly heard Zhou Zuolong’s voice, Zheng Wanyin could not control her emotions at all. ”

Zhou Zuolong treated her as his own and would definitely help her vent her anger.

“When he heard that Zheng Wanyin’s voice was not right, Zhou Zuolong’s heart skipped a beat. “What happened to yinyin? Who bullied you?” ”

“”Grandpa, second aunt, second aunt, she...” ”

“”What happened to her? Did Zhou Xiang Bully you guys? !”On the other end of the phone, Zhou Zuolong was extremely anxious, but Zheng Wanyin could not say a complete sentence. ”

“Zheng Wanyin took a deep breath. “Grandpa, second aunt had a big fight with Grandma and said that she wanted to break off relations with Grandma. She even blocked my phone and Grandma’s wechat. We can’t contact second aunt now.” ”

“”Outrageous! This evil daughter! She’s really too bold!”Zhou zuolong continued, “Yinyin, don’t cry. Don’t worry. With Grandpa around, Grandpa will definitely make a decision for you guys! “Just wait. Grandpa will buy a plane ticket and fly over right away! “I want to see how capable this wicked girl is!” ”

“Okay...”

“Zhou zuolong continued, “How’s Your Grandmother Now?” ”

“Hearing Zhou Zuolong’s voice on the phone, Xie wanqiu immediately winked at Zheng Wanyin. ”

“Zheng wanyin nodded and instantly understood what Xie wanqiu meant, then, she said, “Grandpa! Grandma’s current situation is very bad. She was provoked by second aunt before. Today, she was provoked by second aunt again. Now, she has already fainted. Grandpa, what should I do now!” ”

“At the end of her sentence, Zheng Wanyin cried out loud. ”

“When he heard that Xie Wanqiu was in a bad condition, Zhou Zuolong was very anxious. However, they were so far away. Even if he was anxious, he had no choice but to comfort her, “Don’t Cry, yinyin, listen to me! Take good care of your grandma. Grandpa will be here soon!” ”

“”Then, Grandpa, come quickly. Grandma and I will wait for You!” ”

“Okay!”

“After hanging up the phone, Zhou Zuolong immediately ordered people to book the flight tickets to Beijing. ”
