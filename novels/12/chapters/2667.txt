Two people like this were destined to be together forever.

“”Qin Xue, what are you looking at?”Tang mi walked over. ”

“Qin Xue smiled and said, “I’m Looking at Fifth Master and Miss Ye.” ”

“Tang mi continued, “Are you especially envious of this kind of love?” ”

“Yes.”Qin Xue nodded.

“Tang mi stretched out her hand and put it on Qin Xue’s shoulder. “Don’t be envious. One day, you will also encounter this kind of love.” ”

“Will I?”Qin Xue asked.

“Yes.”Tang mi nodded.

“Qin Xue continued, “Team leader Tang, why haven’t you found a boyfriend yet?”Tang Mi was ye Zhuo’s right-hand woman. She had a lot of experience in the base, but she didn’t put on airs. ”

“Tang mi said, “Actually, I don’t want to get married.” ”

“Don’t want to Get Married?”Qin Xue asked.

Tang mi nodded.

“Qin Xue asked, “Have you been injured before?” ”

“”No.”Tang mi shook her head, “It’s not that I don’t believe in love. I just don’t look forward to it. I think that a person is pretty good. Perhaps the current me is the old master five.”. Did you know? The old master five didn’t believe in love. We all thought that he would become a monk!” ”

Tang Mi was neither looking forward to it nor looking forward to it.

“Qin Xue said, “I’ve heard of it.” ”

“As she said that, Qin Xue smiled and said, “That’s why it’s very important to meet the right person at the right time.”If Cen Shaoqing really had the heart to become a monk, then even if he met ten ye Zao.., he wouldn’t change his mind. ”

“”Yes.”Tang mi nodded, ”

“as she finished speaking, Tang mi continued, “Do you know what master five once said?” ”

“What did he say?”Qin Xue asked.

“Tang mi said, “Master five said that he was in a relationship with Miss Ye and that he was climbing up the social ladder. Moreover, he was also the one who took the initiative to pursue Miss Ye. “There were many people who wanted to interfere in their relationship. In the end, before miss ye discovered them, master five took action to get rid of them.” ”

These words were a warning as well as a warning.

Tang Mi was just not arrogant. She was not a fool. She could see through Qin Xue’s little thoughts.

Qin Xue had her own unique views on scientific research. She was an extremely talented junior. Tang mi also did not want her to ruin her future in her own hands.

“Speaking up to this point, Tang mi paused. “My cousin Tang Xue is a good example.” ”

Tang Xue was much more outstanding than the current Qin Xue. She originally had a bright future ahead of her.

Unfortunately...

“Qin Xue was also a smart person. She smiled at Tang Mi, then, she said, “Team leader Tang, don’t worry. Although my name has the word ‘Xue’in it, I will definitely not become the second Tang Xue. “I came to the base to work and realize my dream. I will definitely not dream of things that don’t belong to me.” ”

“Work hard.”Tang Mi stopped smiling and patted Qin Xue’s shoulder. “I have high hopes for you.”

“Actually, this sentence had another meaning. ”

I’ll supervise you.

“Once Qin Xue felt something was wrong, Tang Mi would take action. ”

“Qin Xue nodded. “Don’t worry, team leader Tang.” ”

Tang mi looked at Qin Xue’s back.

“”Team leader Tang, What’s Wrong?”Cen Hu walked over from the side. ”

Tang mi turned around. “Do young people nowadays like to take shortcuts?”

“”Good Lord, you’re talking like you’re 70 or 80 years old!”Cen Hu continued, “Who are you talking about?” ”

“Since Tang Mi had already warned Qin Xue, she wouldn’t tell anyone else about this matter. She continued, “I’m just expressing my feelings.” ”

“Cen Hu continued, “Are you free tonight?” ”

“You want to ask me out?”Tang mi turned around.

Cen Hu immediately crossed his hands and acted as if he was keeping his distance from Tang Mi. “Don’t misunderstand. I’m not interested in women!”

“Tang mi smiled and said, “Then what should I do? I’m super interested in you.” ”

“Don’t be like this.”Cen Hu immediately crossed his hands and hugged his skinny self. “I’m so scared!”

“Tang Mi was a little speechless. “Tell me, what’s Going On?” ” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Cen Hu continued, “Isn’t that Miss Ye and master five about to get married? My Big Brother said that the few of us should get together to discuss what gifts to prepare for them.” ”

“The few of them had all been brought up by Ye Zhuo. If it weren’t for Ye Zhuo, they wouldn’t be here now. ”

They would definitely give ye Zao a surprise for his wedding.

“”Yeah, I’ve been too busy recently. I almost forgot about this!”In total, Ye Zao and Cen Shaoqing’s wedding was less than two months away. ”

“Cen Hu continued, “Are you free tonight?” ”
