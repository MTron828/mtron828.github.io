“The most effective way to buy people’s Hearts was money. After all, money could make the devil move. ”

ZY’s air-conditioned clothes were very popular.

“Not only were they expensive, ordinary people couldn’t buy them at all. ”

Li Yueyue didn’t say anything and just looked at Feng Xianxian.

“Feng Xianxian smiled and said, “Yueyue, I guess you don’t know what air-conditioned clothes are, right? Air-conditioned clothes are clothes that can adjust the temperature according to the human body’s temperature. It’s warm in winter and cool in summer! It’s like carrying an air-conditioner with you!” ”

Li Yueyue was just a lackey from the countryside.

It was normal for her to not know about Zy’s air-conditioned shirt.

“Bai Xiaoman continued, “Li Yueyue, do you know how expensive ZY’s air-conditioned shirt is? I’m afraid that even with all the savings of your family combined, you might not be able to afford an air-conditioned shirt! It’s your honor to be able to meet Xianxian. Hurry up and thank Xianxian!” ”

Li Yueyue took the bag and smiled.

Feng Xianxian also smiled.

She knew that no one in this world could resist the temptation of money.

But in the next second.

Feng Xianxian was stunned.

Because Li Yueyue threw the bag into the trash can. “Who cares about your things!”

“Bai Xiaoman was shocked and said angrily, “Li Yueyue! You’re too much! How can you throw away Xianxian’s things!” ”

“”I’ve gone too far?”Li Yueyue looked at Bai Xiaoman and said, “Then when Feng Xianxian threw away the milk chips that I gave her, didn’t she go too far?” ”

“Bai Xiaoman said, “How much is that lousy milk chip of yours worth? How can it be compared to the air-conditioner clothes that Xianxian gave me? !” ”

A country bumpkin was indeed a country bumpkin!

He didn’t even have the slightest discernment.

“Li Yueyue sneered, “Bai Xiaoman, I can finally see it! You’re just a dog by Feng Xianxian’s side! In order to get some meat scraps from her, you don’t even want your dignity anymore! Disgusting!” ”

Bai Xiaoman was also pampered and raised.

When had she ever been treated like this?

“She had never been pointed at and scolded before, so she immediately raised her hand and wanted to give Li Yueyue a slap. ”

Li Yueyue was dumbfounded.

“Although she had a strong personality, her fighting ability was not very strong. Seeing that Bai Xiaoman’s palm was about to fall, Li Yueyue was so scared that she closed her eyes. ”

“However, the palm that she had imagined did not fall. ”

Li Yueyue opened her eyes quietly and saw a hand holding Bai Xiaoman’s wrist that was falling.

“Looking up, she saw that face with picturesque features. ”

This was...

Ye Zhuo!

“Ye Zhuo was 1.73 meters tall, taller than her and Bai Xiaoman. A shadow was reflected on Li Yueyue’s face. ” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Li Yueyue only felt that the person in front of her was really cool!

“Bai Xiaoman did not expect ye Zao to suddenly make a move. She also did not expect ye Zao to be so powerful. “Ye Zao, let go of Me!” ”

“Apologize to Yueyue.”

“Ye Zao’s tone was clear and shallow, but there was a sense of oppression. ”

“Bai Xiaoman said, “She was the one who scolded me first! Why should I apologize to her?” ”

Ye Zao tilted his head slightly. “Then why didn’t you say that you provoked Yueyue First?”

“Bai Xiaoman said angrily, “If Li Yueyue didn’t throw away Xianxian’s gift, would I have done that?” ”

“”Feng Xianxian threw away Yueyue’s milk pills first, so Yueyue threw away her air-conditioning clothes. So, they don’t owe each other anything! Why are you meddling in this? Apologize!” ”

“At the last sentence, Ye Zao increased the strength in his hands. ”

“She still seemed to be gently pinching Bai Xiaoman’s wrist, but Bai Xiaoman grimaced in pain. “You, let go of me!” ”

“Apologize.”

“”Okay, okay, okay, I apologize, I apologize.”Bai Xiaoman turned her head to apologize to Feng Xianxian. “Li Yueyue, I’m sorry.” ”

“Only then did ye Zao let go of Bai Xiaoman’s wrist. “Yueyue, let’s go.” ”

“Okay.”Li Yueyue held onto ye Zao’s arm and walked out of the dormitory.

“When they reached downstairs, Li Yueyue said excitedly, “Zao Zao, you’re really amazing! I admire you so much! From now on, you’ll be my idol!” ”

“Ye Zao’s eyebrows remained the same. “You have to change your temper too. Otherwise, you’ll be at a disadvantage outside.” ”

“Li Yueyue nodded. “I also know that my temper is a little hot, but I can’t change it. Zao Zao, can you teach me a few moves?” ”

“I’ll consider it if you treat me to dessert.”Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows.

“It’s a deal!”

...

On the other side.

In the boys’dormitory.

Lin Ze came out of the shower and received a phone call.

“It was unknown what was said on the other end of the phone, but Lin ze said, “Okay, I’ll be right back.” ”

“After saying that, Lin Ze hurriedly changed his clothes and returned to the Lin residence. ”

Old Mrs. Lin was not at home.

Aunt Zhang also followed her out.

Lin Ze avoided the servants at home and went to Old Mrs. Lin’s room to rummage through the cabinets.

He was looking for the key.

He was looking for the key to Lin Jincheng’s room.

“This summer vacation, Lin Ze had searched every corner of the Lin family except for Lin Jincheng’s room. ”

Lin Jincheng’s room was locked all year round.

“Apart from Lin Jincheng, only old Mrs. Lin had the key. ”

“Previously, Lin Ze had tactfully asked for the key from old Mrs. Lin, but Old Mrs. Lin had directly rejected him. Moreover, her expression was very ugly. ”

Lin Ze felt that Lin Jincheng’s room must be hiding a secret!

“Otherwise, old Mrs. Lin wouldn’t be so angry! ”

“As time passed, Lin Ze still couldn’t find the key. He was so anxious that his forehead was covered in sweat. ”

“At this moment, he finally saw a rusty key in the old lady’s jewelry box. ”

It must be this key.

“Lin Ze picked up the key, restored the jewelry box to its original state, and ran upstairs. ”

Lin Jincheng’s room was on the fifth floor. Lin Ze took a deep breath and inserted the key.

Crack —

The door opened.

It really was this key!

Lin Ze was overjoyed.

He walked into the room and closed the door.

The layout of the room was very simple.

“There was a bed, two bedside cabinets, and then a wardrobe. ”

Lin Ze opened the cabinet and did not find anything unusual inside.

“At this moment, Lin Ze suddenly saw a safe in the corner. ”

His intuition told Lin ze that this safe must contain secrets about his mother.

Lin Ze tried to enter the password.

He entered his birthday and Lin Jincheng’s birthday.

But... nothing was right.

“The safe was connected to the internet. If he entered the wrong password three times in a row, the alarm would go off. ”

“Lin Ze took out his phone and took a few photos. Then, he made a call. “Can you decipher the password of this safe?” ”
