Translator: 549690339

“”Apply whether she wants to see you,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“Yu Niannian was a little speechless and said, “Is there a need to apply?” ”

Why did it sound like Cen Shaoqing had to coax her?

“Under such circumstances, shouldn’t the woman coax Cen Shaoqing? ”

“Of course!”Cen Shaoqing said as if it was a matter of course.

“Yu Niannian continued, “Zixu, where’s your manliness?” ”

When did Cen Shaoqing become like this?

“”In front of the person you like, there’s no need for any manliness,”Cen Shaoqing replied. ”

Yu Niannian:”...”Cen Shaoqing had really changed.

Cen Shaoqing in the past could not say such words.

“Yu Niannian suppressed the shock in his heart and continued, “Alright, go back and apply. Let’s go out for a walk now.” ”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and followed Yu Luonian’s footsteps.

“After a few steps, Cen Shaoqing stopped and continued, “Bring an umbrella.” ”

“Why?”Yu Luonian asked.

“CEN Shaoqing explained, “The sun is too strong outside, it will burn the skin.” ”

“Yu Luonian thought it made sense, so he asked the butler to bring two umbrellas. ”

But Cen Shaoqing refused. “I don’t need umbrellas.”

“Why don’t You Want Them?”Yu Niannian asked curiously.

“”We’re different,”Cen Shaoqing said concisely. ”

“Yu Niannian said somewhat speechlessly, “We’re both men, so how are we different!” ” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Cen Shaoqing looked into the distance. “After all, I have a girlfriend who personally applied sunscreen on me, and you...”at this point, Cen Shaoqing turned to look at Yu Niannian. “You’re still single.” ”

Yu senility:”...”

“With that, Cen Shaoqing walked forward. ”

Yu senility decided not to use an umbrella and immediately trotted to follow Cen Shaoqing’s footsteps.

“”Zixu, I’m a little flustered by you.” ”

“What are you flustered about?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“Yu senility continued, “I’m worried that you, a ten-thousand-year-old monk, will be deceived.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing had never been in contact with the opposite sex, nor had he ever been in a relationship. It was too easy to deceive such a person. ”

“Although Yu Niannian had never met Cen Shaoqing’s little girlfriend, her first impression of her was not very good. ”

Because CEN Shaoqing was too protective of her.

“He had never gotten to know her in depth, yet Cen Shaoqing was so protective of her. Did he really understand her? ”

Yu Niannian had always believed in one sentence.

The best way to understand a woman was in bed.

“No one can lie to me.”Cen Shaoqing looked back slightly. “Unless I’m willing to be lied to.”

“Yu Niannian was stunned, “So were you lied to?” ”

“No.”

“Yu Niannian continued, “If your little girlfriend really didn’t lie to you, why did you treat her so well and trust her so much?” ”

“”Because she’s worth it,”Cen Shaoqing said word by word. ”

“Yu Niannian did not know what to say, “From the looks of it, you’ve never been lied to by a woman before! Zixu, calm down. Let’s date first and don’t be in a hurry to get married!” ”

“I came here to propose.”Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads.

“Propose? !”Yu sunset widened his eyes.

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“”Then you have to think carefully.”Yu sunset continued, “Can you wait for me to finish seeing your little girlfriend before proposing?” ”

“”I said, I want to apply,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

Yu sunset didn’t know what to say.

How did the high-spirited CEN fifth master become like this?

He was indeed a femme fatale!

“Then when can you apply?”Yu Luonian continued to ask.

“”It depends on the mood of the leader,”Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips lightly opened. ”

“Leader?”Yu Luonian narrowed his eyes and looked at Cen Shaoqing. “Your little girlfriend?”

“Yes.”

Yu Luonian didn’t know how to describe Cen Shaoqing.

...

On the other side.

“Although there was only one person, Ye Zao was still having a very happy dinner. ”

“After eating light dishes for several days in a row, Ye Zao’s mood became better when the dishes suddenly became hot and spicy. ”

He turned his head and looked out of the window.

The Sun was setting and the sea breeze was blowing gently. There were many people who came to the beach to take a walk in the evening.

Ye Zao became interested and immediately put down his chopsticks. He went to the bathroom to change his clothes and planned to go for a walk by the beach to get some fresh air.

“A few minutes later, ye Zao walked out of the bathroom. ”

“He had changed his white home clothes into a light blue dress with a suspenders. His long black hair had turned into a fishbone braid and was placed diagonally in front of his chest. Although it was almost evening, the Sun by the beach was still very bright. Ye Zao took out a straw hat and put it on his head, only then did he leave the house. ”

The beach was undulating with waves. Many shellfish and corals rushed over.

“Ye Zao took off his sandals, picked up the shells, and used his phone to take photos. ”

“Soon, the sky darkened. ”

A bright moon rose from Hai Ming.

“Ye Zao stood there and looked at the Bright Moon. The sea breeze blew, and the wide hem of his skirt fluttered in the wind, as if he could ride the wind and return at any time. ”

The beautiful scenery here was all taken by a tall figure with a camera.

“After a while, he put away his camera and ran over. ”

“Ye Zhuo.”

“Hearing a familiar voice, ye Zhuo looked up and said in surprise, “Brother Song.” ”

It was song Shiyu.

“”Long time no see,”ye Zhuo continued. ”

It had been a long time since they last saw each other.

“If song Shiyu remembered correctly, the last time they spoke was a year ago. ”

“”Long time no see,”song Shiyu continued, “Did you come alone?” ”

“”With my boyfriend,”ye Zhuo answered. ”

“Song Shiyu smiled and said, “When are you going to do something? I’ll definitely give you a big gift.” ”

“Really?”Ye Zhuo said.

“A gentleman’s word.”

“Ye Zhuo thought he was joking and said, “Okay, I’ll definitely inform you when we get married.” ”

“”It’s a deal,”song Shiyu said. ”

Ye Zhuo looked at song Shiyu. “What About You?”

“Me?”Song Shiyu asked.

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “That’s right. When are you planning to Get Married?”

“Song Shiyu looked in the direction of the sea and said calmly, “There’s no rush.” ”

The bottom of the sea was the moon in the sky.

The person in front of him was his sweetheart.

“His heart had always been a spectator’s heart, but unfortunately, he was a character in a drama. ”
