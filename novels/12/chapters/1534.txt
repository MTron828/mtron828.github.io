“Then, the young woman kicked the thief’s calf and said fiercely, “Give me back my wallet! Run! Run! Why Don’t You Run!” ”

“”I didn’t steal her wallet!”The thief looked at ye Zao, “Let Go of me quickly! Otherwise, I’ll call the Police!” ”

“Ye Zao held the thief’s wrist with one hand and took out his phone with the other. His tone was very calm, “No need to trouble you, I’ll do it myself.” ”

The thief was on the verge of tears.

“He had been in the industry for three to four years and with his swift movements, he had never failed before. He had never expected that he would be caught by a little girl this time. ”

Back.

He was really unlucky!

“”Don’t! Don’t! Big Sister, Great Aunt, please spare me this time! The item is in my pocket! It’s almost new year. I beg you to be merciful and let me off. Please don’t call the Police!” ”

Ye Zhuo looked at the young woman. “See if the things are in his pocket.”

The young woman nodded and indeed took out a wallet from his pocket. She opened the wallet and heaved a sigh of relief. “It’s Alright! The things are all here!”

“At this moment, the surrounding crowd ran over with two policemen. “Officers, this is the person who stole the things!” ”

“When the two police officers heard that someone had caught the thief, they thought that the person was a tall and sturdy boy. They did not expect that the person was actually a little girl. They were a little surprised. ”

“”Little comrade, thank you so much!” ”

Ye Zhuo handed the person over to the police officer. “It’s my duty to see injustice on the road.”

Ye Zhuo just caught the thief in passing and did not need to go back to make a statement. The young woman was the victim and needed to go to the police station with him.

“Looking at the back view of the thief being taken away by the police, Cara walked to ye Zhuo’s side and said with some excitement, “Dr. YC, are those moves of yours the legendary Chinese kungfu?” ”

“In the past, he had often seen Chinese kungfu on television and thought that Chinese kungfu was just a fantasy of Chinese people. He did not expect to see the real Chinese kungfu today! ”

It was simply too shocking.

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Yes. This is Chinese kungfu!” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“”Dr. YC, you are really amazing!”Kara gave ye Zhuo a thumbs up. ”

The people behind Kara also nodded.

“”It should be said that Chinese kungfu is amazing,”ye Zhuo said. ”

“After touring the Great Wall, ye Zhuo brought everyone to the theater to listen to Beijing Opera. He thought that they would not like the babbling Beijing opera, but they did not expect that they would listen with great interest and were very engrossed in it. ”

“After watching the Beijing opera, Ye Zao brought everyone to eat. ”

“For foreign friends, what was the most shocking thing to eat? ”

“Of course, it had to be the Manchu-han banquet! ”

“The restaurant was located in the most prosperous area of the capital. The waiters in the restaurant were all dressed in court attire. The business of this restaurant was very hot, and they needed to make an appointment half a month in advance. However, ye Zao had their platinum members, therefore, there was no need to make an appointment. ”

“Ye Zao stood at the table and introduced the origins of the Manchu-han banquet to everyone, “The Manchu-han banquet is a royal feast during the Qing dynasty. It combines the characteristics of the palace dishes and also has the essence of the local flavor. It highlights the special flavor of Manchu and Han dishes. It is also a treasure and the highest realm of the Chinese cuisine!” ”

“Because they had informed everyone beforehand, each dish had very little portion, so they were not afraid that they would not be able to finish it. ”

“”The small bowl in front of everyone is the dish with the most ingredients in the Manchu-han banquet. There are more than a dozen ingredients used. Not only is it rich in nutrients, but it also tastes very good. Everyone, try it.” ”

“Hearing this, everyone looked at each other and then picked up the spoon and ate a mouthful at the same time. ”

“The food in foreign countries was exquisite and light. It was very different from the food in China. Everyone thought that they would not be used to eating Buddha jumps over the wall, but they did not expect that after one mouthful, they would be very surprised. ”

The taste and texture were simply superb!

“It’s really delicious!”Jamila exclaimed.

The others nodded as well. “I’ve never eaten such delicious food!”

“Ye Zao continued, “This is just the appetizer. The main event is still to come.” ”

“The guests and hosts enjoyed the meal. Kara and the others originally had many opinions about China and thought that China was a barbarian country, but now, they had no opinions at all! ”

“Before leaving, Cara said to ye Zao, “Dr. YC, you are welcome to visit China anytime. I will definitely do my best to host you.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly. “I wish you all a safe journey.”

“Thank you.”

“Looking at Ye Zao’s back, Dr. Cara sighed, “This YC is a little different from what I imagined.” ”
