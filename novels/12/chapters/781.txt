“Are you guys going to look for my father?”Ye Zhuo asked.

The butler nodded. “This young man has something to say to the family head.”

Ye Zhuo smiled slightly. “Just tell me if there’s anything. My father is quite busy right now. He might not have the time to be a slut.”

The Butler knew ye Zhuo’s position in the Lin family. He turned to look at little dai. “Then you can tell our young miss.”

Little Dai nodded and repeated what Old Lady Lin had said.

“Hearing this, Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly.”

It seemed that there was no deviation from his expectations.

Old Lady Lin had indeed brought Feng Xianxian here.

“After about fifteen minutes, little dai returned. He looked at Old Lady Lin and said, “Old Lady Lin, Mr. Lin still has the same intention as before. Miss Feng can not go in!””

Old Lady Lin furrowed her brows tightly. “He doesn’t even want to acknowledge me as his mother?”

“Xiao Dai looked at Old Lady Lin. “Mr. Lin said that if you insist on bringing Miss Feng home, then he can only respect your wishes.””

“Old Lady Lin was so angry that she was trembling. “He, he really said that?”Never in her dreams did she expect that Lin Jincheng would go to such an extent!”

The security guard nodded. “Mr. Lin did indeed say that.”

How dare he?

How dare Lin Jincheng?

Lin Jincheng actually did not even acknowledge her as his mother!

“Old Madam Lin stumbled. If it were not for Feng Xianxian supporting her from behind, she would have fainted.”

Too Much!

This was really too much!

“Feng Xianxian sighed. “Grandma, you can go back first! Talk to Uncle Lin properly. I believe that Uncle Lin is not that kind of unfilial person. There must be some misunderstanding.””

“”No! I Can’t go back!”Old Lady Lin said, “Since this unfilial son has already disowned me, why should I go back!””

The reason why Lin Jin Cheng dared to do this was because he did not dare to leave!

Then she would go and show Lin Jin Cheng!

She wanted to make Lin Jin Cheng regret it.

“Feng Xianxian continued, “Grandma, I can’t let you have any animosity with uncle Lin because of me! You should go back! Otherwise, uncle Lin will really be angry!””

Angry?

Lin Jincheng still dared to be angry?

“Old Lady Lin held Feng Xianxian’s hand tightly, her face full of anger. “That unfilial son still dares to be angry? I’d like to see what he wants to do!””

“”Grandma.”Feng Xianxian frowned. “You’d better go back. After all, Uncle Lin is targeting me, not you. You and uncle Lin are mother and son after all. There’s no need to be so angry between the two of you.””

Go Back?

Old Lady Lin would not go back easily!

“If Lin Jincheng dared to reject her today, she would have to let Lin Jincheng personally invite her and Feng Xianxian back!”

“Otherwise, they would really think that an old woman like her was easy to bully!”

“”Let’s go.”Old Lady Lin pulled Feng Xianxian into the car and instructed the driver, “Xiao Zhao, send us back.””

“Xiao Zhao turned to look at Old Mrs. Lin with a troubled expression, “Old Mrs. Lin, Mr. Lin just called and said that if you insist on going back with Feng Xianxian, then this car can not be used by you...””

“Old Mrs. Lin’s face was already ugly to begin with, and now it was even uglier.”

“Good! Good! Good job! Lin Jincheng is really good!”Old Mrs. Lin was so angry that her entire body was trembling.

“Feng Xianxian supported Old Lady Lin and said worriedly, “Grandma, Uncle Lin seems to be really angry this time.””

“Let’s Go! Let’s Get Out! We’re not taking his car!”

Old Lady Lin brought Feng Xianxian out of the car.

Feng Xianxian took out her phone. “Then I’ll call an online car-hailing service.”

Old Lady Lin nodded.

“Soon, the online car-hailing service arrived.”

It was a very ordinary Volkswagen.

“The moment she got into the car, old Mrs. Lin’s face turned green.”

It was fine that the car seat was not made of real leather.

“The car still emitted the smell of inferior plastic. If she drove a little faster, she could hear the noise coming from the window.”

Old Mrs. Lin planned to stay in a hotel near Feng Xianxian’s home.

“Soon, the car arrived at the entrance of the hotel.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Feng Xianxian helped old Mrs. Lin to the front desk of the hotel.

This was a high-end five-star hotel.

“Feng Xianxian said, “Hello, I’m looking for a presidential suite.””

“How long will you be staying?”

Feng Xianxian looked at Old Mrs. Lin.

“Old Mrs. Lin continued, “Let’s book it for three days first.”She didn’t believe that Lin Jincheng wouldn’t come to pick her up three days later.”

“The receptionist nodded and operated the computer. “The suite is ready. Please deposit 10,000 yuan first. Do you want to use wechat or Alipay?””
