How did the other party cure him of his poison?

“Who did you say was the person who cured him of his poison? What’s his name?”

“Although Father Zhao had said many times that ye Zhuo was very powerful, Mike did not take her to heart. ”

“”Ye Zhuo, Ye Zi’s Ye, beside the word ‘fire’.” ”

“Got it.”

“Mike...”

“Just as Father Zhao was about to say something else, Mike hung up the phone. ”

On the other side.

“Mike put out the cigarette butt in the Ashtray, released the beauty in his arms, lifted the quilt, and walked to the computer desk. ”

“”Dear, what’s Wrong?”The gorgeous woman on the bed looked at Mike’s back in confusion. ”

“He was a man who was in high spirits just a second ago, but after he picked up the phone, he became like this. The gorgeous woman was very confused. ”

“Mike didn’t say anything. He sat down at the computer desk, opened the lid of the laptop with one hand, operated the mouse with one hand, and pressed the keyboard with the other. ”

A crackling sound immediately came from the air.

The next second.

Ye Zao’s information appeared on the computer screen.

Ye Zao.

Female.

Twenty years old.

Chinese.

...

“Other than her age and nationality, her other information was encrypted with question marks. ”

It was impossible to find out.

Mike frowned slightly.

“Although his hacking skills could not be compared to professional hackers, among ordinary people, he was considered to be at the pinnacle of perfection. ”

It was impossible that he could not even find out the information of a Chinese person.

Unless...

This person also had strong attainments in the field of hacking.

But...

What attainments could a Chinese person have in the hacker world?

“Moreover, she was only 20 years old. ”

“20 years old, and she had not even graduated from university. ”

“Mike opened a dialog box, [ Hello? ] ” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“[ yes, speak. ] A very simple reply. ”

[ help me investigate a person. ]

[ send it over. ] The other party immediately replied.

“Mike continued typing, [ China, Ye Zhuo. ] ”

The other party did not reply immediately.

A moment later.

A picture was sent over.

Mike opened it and took a look. This picture was exactly the same as the information he had found.

“Other than some basic information, ye Zhuo’s other information was all encrypted. On the picture, there were all black question marks. ”

This was a little unbelievable!

“After all, the other party was the number one hacker in C Nation, Joe! ”

Joe was already the best in the hacker alliance ten years ago. How could he not be able to find a single person’s information?

Mike: [ ? ? ? You Can’t find out either? ]

“Joe immediately replied: [ this person’s information, there are at least ten hackers helping her encrypt it. ] ”

More than ten hackers?

“Mike narrowed his eyes and replied, “Is there any way to find out?” ”

“Give me a few more days.”

Since he was number one.

Joe would not admit defeat.

He would definitely find out ye Zhuo’s true identity!

Wasn’t it just ten hackers?

Soon.

He would let the other party know.

Who was the founder of the hacker world.

“[ Okay. ] After sending a word, Mike turned off the computer. ”

“Darling.”The gorgeous girl walked behind Mike and hooked her arm around his neck. “Are you done?”

“Mike pulled her in front of him and kissed her. “Be Good, wait for me for a while.” ”

“Where are you going?”The gorgeous girl asked.

“Mike continued, “I have something to take care of.” ”

“The gorgeous lady said very reluctantly, “Then you have to come back quickly! I’m waiting for You Here!” ”

Mike took his clothes and changed. “Okay.”

Not long after.

A beautiful lady with long hair walked out of the hotel entrance.

On the other side.

At the hospital.

The three police officers stayed in the ward for half an hour before they came out.

“When he saw the police officers coming out, Father Zhao’s expression changed, and his palms were covered in a layer of cold sweat. ”

“Although he kept telling himself to calm down, his palms couldn’t help sweating when he saw the police. ”

“”Mr. Zhao, what are you nervous about?”A clear and shallow voice sounded in the air. ”

“Father Zhao turned around and saw ye Zhuo standing beside him. His heart skipped a beat, but he still smiled and said, “I’m just too anxious! I don’t know when I’ll know the murderer who hurt your uncle!” ”

“”Is that right?”Ye Zao continued, “Actually, I am also very curious about who that person is.” ”

This sentence made father Zhao even more uneasy.

Could it be that ye Zao was already suspecting him?

No.

It couldn’t be.

He was ye Sen’s biological father. Why would ye Zao suspect him for no reason?
