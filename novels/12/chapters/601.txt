“But now, she actually changed her words. ”

Feng Xianxian suddenly felt a little afraid that ye Zao would one day snatch her away along with Old Lady Lin.

Feng Qianhua’s expression also changed slightly.

“Feng Xianxian sniffed. “Grandma, did I embarrass you?” ”

“”No! How could that be!”Old Lady Lin held Feng Xianxian’s hand. “In Grandma’s heart, you will always be the best granddaughter.” ”

“Feng Qianhua smiled and said, “Xianxian, you silly girl, how dare you say such silly things! You are the person that Grandma usually loves the most. Aren’t you saying that to chill her heart?” ”

“At this point, Feng Qianhua paused and continued, “But Aunt Lin, I think you are favoring Xianxian too much. After all, Zhuozhuo is your biological granddaughter... Will Zhuozhuo be angry if you favor Xianxian so much?” ”

“I can like whoever I want. She doesn’t have the right to be angry!”Old Lady Lin frowned.

“Feng Qianhua continued, “But if she’s not angry, why doesn’t she come over to our side? If people who don’t know her see this, who would know that you’re her grandmother? Why Don’t you stop treating Xianxian so well in the future...” ”

These words made Old Lady Lin’s anger rise to the extreme again.

Yes.

“From the beginning to the end, ye Zao never took her as a grandmother seriously. ”

“If it were anyone else, they would definitely come to her first. ”

“After all, she was ye Zao’s grandmother! ”

“Without her, how could there be ye Zao? ”

The person ye Zao should be most grateful to right now was her!

But Ye Zao did not even come over to greet her.

Heartless ingrate.

The Lin family had really raised her for nothing.

Did Ye Zao really think that he was amazing just because he became a doctor?

He had not even reached the final step yet!

It was said that the latecomers would catch up.

Feng Xianxian would definitely be more powerful than ye Zao in the future!

“Coincidentally, at this time, someone came to congratulate Old Lady Lin on having a good granddaughter. ”

“”Old Lady Lin, Congratulations! If this was my granddaughter, I’m afraid that I would laugh until I wake up from my dreams!” ”

“When this sentence fell into Old Lady Lin’s ears, it was ear-piercing. ”

“It’s just a phd. It’s not as exaggerated as you say!”

Just a phd?

The people who came to congratulate were stunned.

They even felt that Old Lady Lin was showing off in disguise.

“The more people came to congratulate her, the more uncomfortable Old Lady Lin felt. ”

It would be great if this YC phd was Feng Xianxian.

When would feng Xianxian let her have such a glorious time?

“Ye Zhuo, this wild girl, what right did she have to get all of this? ”

Look at Ye Zhuo’s smug attitude!

Just you wait!

“The Higher You Stand, the more miserable the fall! ”

“Sooner or later, she would cry! ”

“Madam Lin Glanced at ye Zhuo and continued, “Qianhua, let’s go back!” ”

“Feng Qianhua said hesitantly, “If we go back like this, will brother Jincheng be angry?” ”

“Don’t worry about him!”Old Lady Lin turned around and left.

She wanted Lin Jincheng and ye Shu to know that she was angry.

Unfortunately.

“Ye Shu and Lin Jincheng were still immersed in the news that ye Zao was Dr. YC, so they did not notice her at all. ”

“Ye Zao took the flowers. “Thank you, Dad and mom.” ”

“Lin Jincheng looked at his children, and his eyes were slightly red. ”

“In his previous life, he had probably saved the Milky Way galaxy. In this life, he would only have two such outstanding children. ”

Lin Ze took the flowers from ye Shu and a smile blossomed on his lips.

Lin Ze was the type of boy who didn’t like to smile.

“But when he smiled, he was absolutely stunning! ”

“Li Yueyue squeezed through the crowd and walked to ye Zao’s side. “Big Zao! No! Father, is it too late for me to hug your thigh now?” ”

This call of ‘Dad’scared Lin Jincheng and ye Shu to the side.

The two of them turned their heads to look at Li Yueyue.

“They saw that she was a very obedient and beautiful little girl, giving people a very quiet feeling. ”

“If they had not seen it with their own eyes, it was hard to imagine that such a quiet little girl would say such words. ”

“Ye Zao smiled and introduced, “Dad, Mom, brother, this is my roommate, Li Yueyue. Yueyue, this is my dad, this is my mom, and this is my brother, Lin Ze.” ”

“Li Yueyue bowed politely, acting as if they were close. “Hello, Dad! Hello, Mom! Hello, brother! My name is Li Yueyue, and I come from the beautiful and charming prairie. You can just call me Yueyue.” ”

This posture made it seem as if Lin Jincheng and ye Shu were her biological parents.

“Ye Shu and Lin Jincheng smiled and said, “Hello.” ”

Lin Ze nodded politely.

He had never spoken much in front of outsiders.

“Ye Shu continued, “Yueyue, there’s no class tomorrow anyway. Come home with US later. Zhuozhuo hasn’t brought his classmates over yet.” ”
