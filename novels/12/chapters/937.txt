[ Humble Cen Wuye. ]

[ Cen Wuye: today is also the day that I want to become an official. ]

[ will cen Wuye be strict with his wife in the future? ]

“[ I didn’t expect Cen Wuye, who is high and mighty, to be just an intern in front of Yezi. ] ”

[ I’m waiting for Cen Wuye to become an official! ]

“[ Cen Wuye, you can do it! ] ”

[ so sweet! ]

[ did you guys notice the way Cen Wuye looked at Yezi? He was so doting on her! ]

“[ Ahhhh, this is definitely a real-life story of a domineering CEO chasing his wife. ] ”

[ I’m going to eat this real-life couple. ]

[ I want to fall in love too. ]

[ add one more. ]

[ my maiden heart is about to melt. ]

“In order for Cen Wuye to become an official, the bystanders were worried sick. They all came to ye Zhuo’s Weibo to comment. ”

“[ ye, when will you consider making fifth master Cen the next rank? ] ”

[ today is also the day that I beg fifth master Cen to be promoted to the next rank! ]

“[10,000 people’s blood letters beg fifth master Cen to be promoted to the next rank. ] ”

“At this moment, a hot topic on the CEN group’s official Weibo once again appeared on the Hot Topic. ”

CEN Group V: Today is the day that I look forward to fifth master Cen being promoted to the next your melons today.

“With the release of this Weibo Post, various official Weibo accounts exploded. ”

Xi Jian Equipment Company V: today is looking forward to the day when master five becomes a full-time melon today.

Qingjun foreign trade v: today is looking forward to the day when master five becomes a full-time melon today.

[ F * ck! F * ck! So Xinjian and Yuanyi technology are also businesses of the CEN Group! ]

“[ oh my God, so Qingjun is also part of the CEN Group. ] ”

[ I can’t care that the CEN family is the number one family. ]

[ isn’t the Cen family too powerful? ]

[ yezi is about to become the CEN group’s Lady Boss... ]

[ whether or not she will become the lady boss depends on when Yezi wants master five to be promoted. ]

[ I’m so envious! ]

“After a few official Weibo posts were posted, a bunch of onlookers immediately followed suit. ”

“For a moment, ye Zao’s private messages exploded. ”

“Cen Shaoqing sat in the car and flipped through Weibo. His eyes were covered with a faint luster, and the corners of his mouth curled up in an invisible arc. ”

“At this moment, the car door was pulled open. ”

Cen Shaoqing was completely focused on Weibo and did not notice that there was an additional person in the passenger seat.

Until ye Zhuo’s voice appeared in the air. “What are you happy about?”

“Nothing.”Cen Shaoqing put away his phone in a serious manner and sat upright.

“Really nothing?”Ye Zhuo narrowed his eyes.

Cen Shaoqing twirled the prayer beads out of habit. “It’s really nothing.”

Ye Zao lowered his head and carefully fastened his seatbelt.

“At this moment, Cen Shaoqing suddenly leaned over. “Everyone is asking you when can I become a full-time official?” ”

“The two of them were a little close to each other, and their breaths were filled with each other’s breath. ”

“Ye Zao suddenly felt a little nervous, and his heart beat faster. ”

“Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted slightly, and he said word by word, “Leader, when can I become a full-time official?” ”

“With each word he said, his body leaned forward a little. ”

Closer and closer.

Closer and closer.

Until the tip of his tall nose touched the tip of her nose.

“”Leader, answer me. When can I become a formal official? HMM?” ”

“Ye Zhuo reached out and hooked his arm around his neck, then used his red lips to press on his thin lips. ”

Everything was said without saying.

“Cen Shaoqing was stunned for two seconds at first, then he quickly reacted. His sexy Adam’s apple rolled up and down, and in an instant, the guest became the host. ”

Ten minutes later.

“Ye Zhuo’s lips moved away from Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips. His chin rested on Cen Shaoqing’s shoulder, and his breathing was a little ragged. ”

“Cen Shaoqing’s breathing was also a little hurried, and his sword-like eyebrows were slightly furrowed. ”

“One had to know that normally, he wouldn’t even pant when he lifted a barbell that weighed 300 jin in one breath. ”

It had only been ten minutes.

“It seemed like he had to strengthen his training. It had only been a kiss, and he was already panting like this. If it was an even more difficult movement, what would it look like? ”

“Thinking of this, Cen Shaoqing narrowed her eyes. ”

“For the sake of a harmonious and happy life in the future, it seemed like she needed to strengthen her training. ”

“After the press conference ended, song Chenyu browsed through the situation on Weibo, and her face turned green. ”

“The purpose of exposing that photo was to make Cen Shaoqing Hate Ye Zao, Dump Ye Zao, and at the same time, make ye Zao become an Internet blacklist. ”

“She did not expect that not only did ye Zao not become an Internet blacklist, but he had become the envy of everyone. ”

No.

Not like this.

She can not just admit defeat.

On what basis.

Ye Zao on what basis to ride on her head to bully?
