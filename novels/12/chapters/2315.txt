“Meanwhile, Ye Zao had no intention of returning the right to use the base to country C. ”

“Ye Zao’s action had turned country C, the world’s largest country, into a laughingstock. ”

“This time, they had to make use of the oasis project to make ye Zao Fall from the clouds completely. Then, they would take the opportunity to take back country C’s scientific research base and redeem themselves! ”

On the other side.

“When Yu Zifei reached home, his parents were not at home. ”

“Fortunately, he had the keys to the house. ” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“After going home and taking a shower, Yu Zifei went to the nearby supermarket and bought some of his parents’favorite dishes. After going home, he began to show off his skills. ”

“In fact, Yu Zifei was not very good at cooking. After all, he was a grown man. In addition, he was busy with work, so he rarely had time to cook. ”

“Although the taste was not very good, it was still edible. Today was Yu’s mother’s birthday, so it could be considered a token of appreciation from him as a son. ”

“As soon as Yu Zifei’s parents returned home, they felt that there was something wrong with the house. ”

There was a rustling sound in the kitchen.

Was there a burglar in the house?

This was the first reaction of Yu Zifei’s parents.

“After all, Yu Zifei had not returned for four to five months, so both of them subconsciously forgot about their son. ”

“Father Yu and mother Yu looked at each other. Then, they tacitly picked up a high-heeled shoe from the shoe rack and walked towards the kitchen. ”

“The more they walked into the kitchen, the more obvious the sound became. ”

It must have been a burglar!

“Father Yu held mother Yu’s hand and said in a low voice, “I’ll go. You wait here. If anything happens to me, you should quickly run out and call the police.” ”

“Mother Yu swallowed nervously. “Then, then be careful!” ”

“”Don’t worry, I know.”Father Yu patted mother Yu’s hand. ”

“Then, father Yu carefully walked into the kitchen. ”

“As soon as he entered the kitchen, he saw a tall figure busy with work. ”

Father Yu was stunned. Why did this figure look so familiar?

“Just as Father Yu was about to raise his high heels and smash his head, the person who was standing in front of the stove suddenly turned around and saw Father Yu. Yu Zifei was shocked, “Dad? When did you come back? Why isn’t there any sound?” ”

Father Yu looked at Yu Zifei in disbelief. “Zifei!”

“Mother Yu also ran in at this time and said in surprise, “Zifei is back!” ”

“Then, there was a loving hug. ”

“Mother Yu was very excited after not seeing her son for nearly half a year. “Zifei, when did you come back? Why didn’t you inform me in advance? You haven’t come back for a long time. Mom will buy more delicious food for you to eat!” ”

“As she finished speaking, mother Yu turned to Father Yu. “Go and buy some vegetables! Buy More seafood and a pork belly. Zifei likes that.” ”

“”There’s no need for that. The meal is almost ready,”said Yu Zifei. ”

“You’re done?”Mother Yu was very surprised.

Yu Zifei nodded. “Yes.”

“Mother Yu rebuked, “You Child, you’ve only been in the kitchen a few times. How Can You Cook! You can call me if I’m not at home!” ”

“”Mom, did you forget something?”Yu Zifei asked with a smile. ”

“What is it?”Yu Zifei’s mother asked.

“Yu Zifei turned to look at Father Yu. “Dad, you forgot too?” ”

Father Yu was also stunned. He turned to look at Mother Yu. The two of them looked at each other and saw confusion in each other’s eyes.

“What exactly is it?”Yu Zifei’s mother asked.

“Yu Zifei continued, “Mother, it’s your birthday today.” ”

“Hearing this, father Yu slapped his forehead. “How could I have forgotten about this!” ”

“Yu Zifei continued, “That’s why Miss Ye gave me a day off to come back and celebrate your birthday.” ”

“Hearing this, mother Yu was moved and said, “Miss Ye, you’re really thoughtful.” ”

“Nowadays, it was hard to find a good leader like ye Zhuo. ”

“Yu Zifei continued, “Father, mother, quickly go to the dining room. I’m almost done with the meal. When I bring it to the table, we can start eating.” ”

“Father Yu smiled and said, “Today is your mother’s birthday. Let your mother cook and sit. I’ll go with you to serve the dishes.” ”

“Yu Zifei’s mother also wanted to help, but she was pushed out by Father Yu. ”

“In the kitchen, Yu Zifei secretly slipped father Yu a jewelry box. “You can give this to my mother later. Tell her it’s a surprise for her.” ”

“Father Yu was stunned. “But didn’t you buy this for Your Mother?”Father Yu was a very straight man. He had been married to mother Yu for so many years, but he had never taken the initiative to give her a bouquet of flowers or buy a piece of jewelry. ”

“Yu Zifei smiled. “You and my mother haven’t given her a gift for so many years. Don’t you want to give my mother a surprise? Besides, isn’t what I bought the same as what you bought?” ”
