Xie wanqiu hurriedly stood up from Wu Youyu’s embrace.

Wu Youyu was also quite frightened.

Who would have thought that Zhou Zuolong would come back at this time?

“What should we do? Quickly find a place to hide!”

“A man and a woman were in the same room, their clothes disheveled. Although Zhou Zuolong was a little stupid, he was not stupid to that extent. ”

“Seeing that the door was about to be opened, Wu Youyu was very anxious. He looked around and could not find a place to hide. “Where to hide?” ”

“”Hide, hide, hide under the bed!” ”

Wu Youyu quickly hid under the bed. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Xie wanqiu pushed him into the bed and then covered the sheets.

“Just as he was ready, the door of the ward was pushed open from the outside. ”

“Zhou Zuolong and Zheng Wanyin chatted and laughed as they walked in. “Grandpa, you haven’t eaten yet, right? I’ll go buy some food later.” ”

It was still better to be a granddaughter.

“Unlike Zhou Xiang, who had gone to the Cen family for such a long time, Zhou Xiang only knew how to talk back to him. She did not even ask if he wanted to eat or if he was hungry. ”

“Sometimes, being related by blood did not mean anything. ”

“Although Zheng Wanyin was not related to him by blood, she was much better than his biological daughter who was related by blood. ”

“Zhou zuolong smiled and said, “I’m not hungry. You can ask your grandmother what she wants to eat later.” ”

“Okay.”

“Xie wanqiu tidied her hair and tried her best to calm herself down. She smiled and walked outside. “Old Man, yinyin, why did you and your grandson come back together?” ”

“Seeing Xie Wanqiu get up, Zhou Zuolong said in surprise, “Wanqiu, are you alright?” ”

“Xie wanqiu then remembered that she was still sick. Zhou Zuolong’s sudden opening of the door had thrown her into a panic, causing her to forget the most important thing. ”

“Xie wanqiu pinched her temples. “It’s much better than yesterday, so I want to get out of bed and take a walk.” ”

“Zhou zuolong smiled and said, “The heavens really bless us!” ”

Zheng Wanyin looked at the bedside and suddenly felt that something was not right.

Why was there a hand under the bed?

Whose Hand was that?

Was she seeing things?

“At that moment, the owner of the hand seemed to have noticed Zheng Wanyin and immediately retracted his hand. However, in the process of retracting his hand, he accidentally knocked over the fallen vase under the bed. ”

Bang!

There was a loud sound in the air.

There was really someone there!

“Moreover, this person was Wu Youyu! ”

“When she realized this problem, Zheng Wanyin’s brows tightened. ”

Xie Wanqiu was too daring. She actually dared to hide someone under the bed.

“If Zhou Zuolong were to discover this, what would happen? ”

Zheng Wanyin had always thought that Xie Wanqiu was a smart person. She did not expect that Xie Wanqiu was a smart person who was muddle-headed for a lifetime.

The loud noise scared Xie Wanqiu so much that her face turned pale. She looked under the bed.

“When she looked at it, she was even more frightened. ”

“There was not much cover under the bed. As long as she looked down, she would be able to see Wu Youyu’s face. ”

What should she do?

What if Zhou Zuolong looked under the bed?

“Xie wanqiu was as anxious as an ant on a hot pot. However, she still had to pretend that nothing had happened. ”

Zhou Zuolong looked around curiously. “What’s that sound?”

“What Sound?”Xie Wanqiu’s lips curled into a smile. “Why didn’t I Hear It?”

“You didn’t hear it even though it was so loud?”Zhou Zuolong asked in surprise.

“No.”

Zhou Zuolong narrowed his eyes. “That’s strange. I clearly heard a bang. could someone be hiding in the house?”

“Hearing this, the smile on Xie Wanqiu’s face almost could not be maintained. ”

Could it be that Zhou Zuolong had discovered something?

“At that moment, Zheng Wanyin bent down to pick up the vase on the ground and said with a smile, “I accidentally kicked the vase down.”When she picked up the vase, her gaze met Wu Youyu’s gaze under the bed. ”

Zheng Wanyin’s expression remained the same.

Wu Youyu raised his hand to wipe the cold sweat off his forehead. He was very nervous.

“Did Zheng Wanyin notice him, or did she not notice him? ”

“At that moment, Xie Wanqiu’s heart was in her throat. ”

She did not see him.

“With the blessing of Bodhisattva, Zheng Wanyin definitely did not see Wu Youyu. ”

“Zhou zuolong smiled and said, “I told you there was a sound! Wanqiu, you still don’t believe me!” ”

“Xie wanqiu said, “Maybe it’s because I’m getting old and my ears aren’t working properly anymore.” ”

“After a while, Zheng Wanyin straightened her back and her expression remained the same. “Grandma, Are You Hungry Now? I’ll go buy some food for you.” ”

“”No, I’m not hungry.”She was so scared that she was full. What was there to be hungry for? ”

“It was unknown whether Zheng Wanyin saw it or not, but Xie Wanqiu’s face was a little pale. ”

“Zhou zuolong continued, “Wanqiu, why is your face so ugly? Are you uncomfortable?” ”
