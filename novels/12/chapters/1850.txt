“Chapter 1851: 378: Face slapping, scumbag, he regrets it! 2”

Translator: 549690339

“Hearing his own voice, Ye Zhuo was slightly stunned. ”

Ye Han.

So this was ye Han.

“Ye Han smiled and took out a beautiful box from his pocket. “SIS, look at what this is.” ”

Ye Zhuo opened the box and saw a top-grade pigeon blood gem lying inside.

“It was said to be a gem, but it did not have the heaven and earth spiritual energy from the GEM. ”

“Right at this moment, ye Han continued, “Sis, this is a treasure only found in a level three armored beast’s body. I worked hard for half a month to get this one. I wish you a Happy Birthday!” ”

A level three armored beast?

“Only then did ye Zhuo remember that planet E-TY889 wasn’t like Earth. Humans and beasts lived together here, and humans would often receive attacks from armored beasts. ”

And Ye Han was an excellent beastmaster.

This pigeon-blood gem was called Bluestone.

Bluestone had a total of three grades.

“Beginner, intermediate, and top grade. ”

“Beginner was light red, intermediate was dark red, and top grade was this pigeon red. ”

“Not only could bluestone be used as an ornament, it could also be used as an organic fuel. ”

Pigeon-red bluestone could be used as fuel for light-speed spaceships for up to ten years.

There was no market for it.

That was because a level 3 armored beast was even rarer than the giant pandas on Earth.

Ye Han was able to encounter a level 3 armored beast and obtain a top grade green stone. This was even more difficult than the Big Bang.

“Thank you.”Ye Zhuo looked at Ye Han. “I like it very much.”

“”It’s good that you like it.”Ye Han continued, “Sister, let’s have dinner together tonight.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Although she had been hypnotized, Ye Zhuo’s consciousness was very clear. She was in a hypnotized state. After ye Han left, she searched for traces of the past in the office. ”

Outside.

Ye Han had just walked out of the office when he was stopped by autumn flute.

Autumn flute was full of smiles as she walked in front of Ye Han. “Team leader Ye.”

“In front of others, ye Han’s face remained the same. “What’s the matter?” ”

“Qiu di continued, “Team Leader Ye, I heard that today is Miss Ye’s birthday, so I specially prepared a small gift. I hope that team leader Ye can help pass it on to Miss Ye.” ”

“”I’m sorry, my sister never accepts gifts on her birthday,”ye Han said. ”

“The smile on Qiu Di’s face did not change as she continued, “Then I wonder if team leader ye can honor us and have dinner together?” ”

Ye Han was ye Zao’s confidant.

“As long as she could rope in ye Han, half of her plan would succeed. ”

But autumn flute still thought too simply.

“Ye Han directly rejected, “I’m not free.” ”

“It was a very simple word, but it made autumn flute’s expression immediately change. ”

“One was green, the other was white. ” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Ye Han was the same as ye Zao.

They were both cheap bones!

They were given face but did not want it.

“The two of them came from humble backgrounds and had no background. To be able to get to where they were today, it was all due to luck! ”

“If they didn’t have this kind of luck, these two people would both be the lowest of the low. ”

What right did this kind of low-class people have to give her face!

Who Was She.

The eldest daughter of the Qiu family who was born superior.

Why did she have to look at Ye Zao’s face.

Why did she have to spend so much effort to please ye Zao.

A scene from more than ten years ago appeared in Qiu Di’s mind.

“At that time, Ye Zao was still a poor wretch that no one wanted. At that time, she should have spent some money to buy ye Zao back as a servant. ”

Why?

Why didn’t she do that at that time?

“Qiu di bit her lips tightly. Because she was too strong, very soon, her mouth was filled with a strong smell of blood. ”

Wait.

“She must make ye Zhuo and ye Han, these two B * tches, pay the price. ”

Ye Zhuo opened the office door and saw this scene.

Not far away.

A woman stood there with a sinister look in her eyes.

Who Was This?

How come she had never seen this person before?

“When she saw ye Han and Zhong Li, although ye Zhuo could not name them for a moment, he did not feel anything when he saw this woman. ”

“But subconsciously, ye Zao felt that everything that she had encountered was related to this young woman in front of him. ”

Ye Zao left the window and walked to the computer. He opened the computer’s search engine and used his senses to find the population database of the Chang Yue country.

“Soon, he locked onto that young woman. ”

Qiu Di.

Female.

20 years old.

Daughter of the Qiu family’s Qiu Chang Town.

Qiu Family?

“Ye Zao narrowed her eyes. At this moment, a beam of white light suddenly appeared before her eyes. When she opened her eyes again, everything before her eyes changed again. ”

Where was this place?

Ye Zao was stunned for a moment.

“”Zao Zao.”At this moment, Cen Shaoqing’s voice that was exclusive to her appeared in the air. It was deep and magnetic. “How do you feel?” ”

Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Can you do it again?”

“Not today.”Cen Shaoqing handed her a glass of water. “Your sudden awakening indicates that your body has reached its upper limit.”
