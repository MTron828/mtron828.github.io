“Okay.”

The few of them stood up as well.

Bai Mo could only interrupt this topic.

“Not long after, Ye Han received a message from Shi Qingcheng. He raised his head to look at grandfather Bai. “Grandfather, my girlfriend has arrived. I’ll go pick her up.” ”

“”Hurry up and go. Don’t make Miss Shi wait so anxiously,”grandfather Bai said. ”

“Okay.”Ye Han nodded and turned to leave.

“Bai Mo narrowed her eyes and looked up at Ye Han. She smiled and said, “Ye Xiaohan, I’ll go with you.” ”

She wanted Shi Qingcheng to see the sense of danger.

“At the same time, she wanted Shi Qingcheng to know that she knew ye Han before she did. ”

“Elder bai continued, “Little Girl Mo, Mr. Ye is going to pick up his girlfriend. Why are you joining in the fun? What if Miss Shi misunderstood?” ”

“Bai Mo had already cursed Old Master Bai a thousand times in her heart. She smiled and raised her head. “I don’t think Miss Shi is that stingy, right? Don’t you think so, Ye Xiaohan?” ”

“”You should call me ye Han.”Ye Han turned around and said, “Our Qingcheng really doesn’t like me to get too close to other girls.” ”

Bai Mo’s face turned pale.

“Old Master Bai’s face also didn’t look too good. He had lived for so long, so he could tell at a glance what those people wanted to do. ” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Although Bai Mo was his granddaughter, he still felt that Bai Mo’s eating style was a little ugly. ”

“After all, Ye Han already had a girlfriend! ”

What was Bai Mo doing now?

Poaching someone else?

The descendants of the Bai family definitely couldn’t do such a shameful thing.

“”Little girl Mo, go to the study and bring over my walking stick,”Old Master Bai continued. ”

“Okay.”Bai Mo nodded.

“Looking at Bai Mo’s back, Old Master Bai shook his head helplessly and said to Bai Jingshu, “Your little sister really worries me to death.” ”

Bai Yuanyuan curled her lips. This old man was really biased.

“Bai Mo didn’t do anything wrong, so what right did he have to say that about Bai Mo.. ”

“In his heart, the granddaughter he liked was always right no matter what she did. ”

Everything she and Bai Mo did was wrong.

The mistake was that she did not have Bai Jingshu’s ability to please others.

“Bai Jingshu said, “Mo Mo is still young, so it’s inevitable that she won’t be able to consider many things properly. Don’t worry.” ”

Elder Bai sighed.

“Over the years, the Bai family had really been getting worse with each generation. ”

“On the other side, Ye Han successfully received Shi Qingcheng. ”

“Shi Qingcheng smiled and asked, “How was it? Did brother Ze meet his parents smoothly?” ”

Ye Han nodded. “It went quite smoothly. Elder Bai really likes brother Ze.”

“”It’s really rare that elder Bai doesn’t have a sense of family status,”Shi Qingcheng Sighed. ”

“One had to know that in the s galaxy, everyone had a deep-rooted sense of family status. ”

It was really rare for elder Bai to not mind that Lin Ze was an earthling.

“Ye Han said, “Elder Bai looks like a sensible grandpa. Oh right, I have something to tell you.” ”

“What is it?”Shi Qingcheng asked.

“Ye Han continued, “Well, Bai Mo is here today.” ”

Bai Mo?

Shi Qingcheng narrowed her eyes and thought for a moment. “The girl who asked you out last time?”

Ye Han nodded.

“Shi Qingcheng continued, “That girl looks like a green tea! Remember to stay away from her in the future!” ”

“Although Shi Qingcheng had never seen Bai Mo before, after seeing the message Bai Mo sent to Ye Han, she could basically confirm that Bai Mo was a small green tea. ”

A normal girl would not use that tone to send a message to a male friend.

“”Got it,”ye Han said. ”

The two of them talked as they walked and soon arrived at the Bai family’s old mansion.

“Shi Qingcheng stood at the entrance of the Bai family’s old mansion and sighed, “The Bai family has quite a deep background.” ”

Ye Han nodded. “The upper three generations of the Bai family are all scholars.”

“No Wonder.”

The two of them walked to the back garden.

“Ye Han led Shi Qingcheng and said, “Grandpa Bai, this is my girlfriend, Shi Qingcheng. Qingcheng, this is Grandpa Bai. These are sister Jingshu’s two cousins, Bai Mo and Bai Yuanyuan.” ”

“Grandpa Bai nodded kindly. “Hello, Miss Shi.” ”

“”Grandfather Bai.”subconsciously, Shi Qingcheng had a good impression of grandfather Bai. ”

Bai Mo sized Shi Qingcheng up.

Shi Qingcheng was born in a military academy. She had a slender figure and exuded a heroic aura. She did not have a feminine scent. She did not know how ye Han had taken a liking to such a woman.
