Ye Zao’s disappearance was very strange.

“Even if it was the Zen throne, it would not disappear without a trace. ”

“After saying this, man Xing added, “Ye Han also disappeared.” ”

“Hearing this, Zhao Dan also felt a little strange, but she did not take it to heart, she continued, “Xing ‘er, remember what mom said. Ye Zao has nothing to do with you. You only have one younger brother, his name is man Wen. So, whether she was killed or disappeared has nothing to do with us.” ”

“In any case, her full moon had died nineteen years ago. ”

Man Xing sighed and nodded.

“Zhao dan continued, “Xing ‘er, you are different from her. What did Master Yi Say? You are a born Lucky Star. You can bring fortune, but she can only bring disaster.” ”

“”Mom, don’t say that.”Man Xing frowned slightly. “If elder sister hears what you said, she will be sad.” ”

“At this point, man Xing paused, then, he said, “No one is born a lucky star, and no one is born a jinx. These are all superstitions. Mom, our ancestor has moved away from Earth for so many years. Why do you and Dad still believe in this?” ”

“”It’s not superstition, it’s the truth!”Zhao Dan said, “Xing ‘er, your father said that if you want to become a regional overlord, you must be ruthless enough. People like you can’t Do That!” ”

“Manxing was good at everything, but she was too soft-hearted. ”

“If ye Zao was not a disaster star, why did Manxing country’s people have a hard time living after Ye Zao was born? ”

These disasters were clearly brought about by her!

“Ever since ye Zao disappeared, Manxing country had been getting better and better. When Manxing was born, Manxing country had become more and more prosperous. If Manxing was not a lucky star, then what was it? ”

“Manxing continued, “A few days ago, you and father were both in a rage. I didn’t say that elder sister was a powerful existence. How could she be easily plotted against? Moreover, Ye Han was raised by elder sister. How could he betray elder sister?” ”

“No matter how Manxing thought about it, she felt that something was not right. ”

“Otherwise, she would not have checked on ye Zao’s whereabouts. ”

Where did ye Zao and Ye Han Go?

“Zhao Dan said, “She is a jinx. Not only will she bring disaster to others, she will also bring disaster to herself. What’s so strange about that?” ”

“Manxing continued, “Mom, no matter what, eldest sister is your and Dad’s first daughter. I feel that you are being unfair to her.” ”

“”If she was half as sensible as you, would I not like her?”Zhao Dan asked. ”

“Man Xing smiled and said in a very gentle voice, “No one is perfect. Besides, my eldest sister grew up in a different environment than me. Actually, these are all understandable.” ”

“From the beginning to the end, man Xing had always been the kind and understanding person. No matter how many mistakes she made, she would always be able to forgive and understand. ”

Zhao Dan looked at man Xing and felt both relieved and worried.

“As a person, it was better to be kind. ”

But she was also worried that someone would use Manxing’s kindness to do bad things in the future.

“Zhao Dan put away the empty bowl. “Xing ‘er, you go ahead and get busy. I Won’t disturb you anymore.” ”

Manxing stood up and walked Zhao Dan out of the door.

“Just as Zhao Dan went out, she saw Manwen walking in. Manwen was flustered, as if he had something urgent to do. When he saw Zhao Dan, he didn’t even greet her. ”

“Wen ‘er!”Zhao Dan called out to man Wen.

Man Wen acted as if he didn’t hear her.

Zhao Dan frowned. This child was getting more and more muddled!

“Looks like I really can’t count on him in the future!”Zhao Dan said.

“If man Wen treated her like this now, wouldn’t he treat her like air when he married and had children in the future? ” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Every family had their own difficulties.

Everyone said that she had both children and was the first lady of Manxing country. Little did they know that the first lady also had her own troubles.

“MAN XING continued, “Mom, don’t be anxious. Man Wen is still young. He will slowly mature in the future. You have to give him some time. You Can’t force him.” ”

“Zhao Dan smiled at man Xing. “You only know how to find excuses for him. He said that he is young, but in fact, he is only one year younger than you.” ”

“Man Xing was so outstanding, why couldn’t Man Wen learn from him? ”

“”Not to mention one year younger, even if it was one day younger, it would still be younger.”MAN XING continued, “Mom, don’t worry. Your and dad’s genes are so outstanding, man Wen is definitely not that bad.” ”

Zhao Dan smiled. “You’re the only one who knows how to comfort people.”

“Man Xing looked up at the sky and continued, “The weather today is pretty good. Let me accompany you in the garden to relax.” ”
