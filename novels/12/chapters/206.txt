A watchdog is a watchdog!

You Don’t even have eyes!

You even dare to offend the Lady Boss!

They’re finished!

“Li Yiyi quickly found ye Sen’s phone number and called him, asking him to come down personally to pick her up and help her vent her anger. ”

But she had already deleted ye Sen’s phone number.

She also deleted wechat.

“At this time, she could not contact ye Sen, so Li Yiyi could only stand at the door and wait for him. In order to give ye Sen a surprise, she even took out a mirror and lipstick from her bag and began to touch up her makeup. ”

“When Ye Sen got off work and found her waiting for him, he would definitely be very happy. ”

“After all, Ye Sen loved her so much. ”

“Perhaps ye Sen deliberately went to that restaurant today so that she could see him. All men wanted face. He could not bring himself to beg her, so he deliberately went to the restaurant to meet her. ”

He wanted her to see all of this.

“After all, she and Ye Sen had been together for so many years. ”

How could they break up just like that?

“The more Li Yiyi thought about it, the happier she became. She was extremely excited. While she was waiting for Ye Sen, she added all the big-brand bags that she had taken a fancy to into the shopping cart. Ye Sen loved her so much, so he would definitely empty the shopping cart for her. ”

“Oh, right. ”

She still had to get ye Sen to buy her a car.

It was not until 12 o’clock in the afternoon that Li Yiyi saw ye Sen walk out of the company with a briefcase.

Li Yiyi’s eyes lit up and she quickly pounced on him. “Sen!”

“When they were in love, she had always called ye Sen that. ”

Ye Sen frowned slightly and nimbly avoided Li Yiyi.

“Li Yiyi did not pounce on ye Sen. She directly fell to the ground and looked at Ye Sen aggrievedly, “Sen! It’s me! I’m Yiyi! It was my fault. You loved me so much! I shouldn’t have treated you like that! “Actually, I didn’t have a choice. It was all Wang Chenglei. If Wang Chenglei hadn’t threatened me, I wouldn’t have been with that fat pig!” ”

Ye Sen took out his phone from his pocket. “What do you think Wang Chenglei is?”

“Hearing that, Li Yiyi’s eyes lit up. She knew that Ye Sen still loved her deeply, she hurriedly said, “It’s fat pig! Wang Chenglei is a fat pig! He doesn’t deserve me at all! Sen, let’s make up! I love you. I will love you forever! Even when I was forced to be with fat pig, I always thought of you in my heart! Sen, you still love me, right?” ”

Yesen felt like vomiting.

“Before this, he had never known that the woman he had loved for three years was actually like this. ”

It was absolutely disgusting!

How could his taste be so bad in the past? T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Yesen put his phone into his pocket, his expression very calm. ”

“Li Yiyi got up from the ground and held Yesen’s arm, she said coquettishly, “Sen, I knew you still loved me! Just now, I suffered a great grievance. Those employees of your company acted as if they had no eyes and actually chased me out of the door! “And they even said I was shameless! “Sen, you have to stand up for them!” ”

“”They are right. You Are Shameless!”Ye Sen flung Li Yiyi’s hand away. “Li Yiyi, you are a B * Tch who is greedy for money! Do you think I will still be with you? Wishful Thinking!” ”

Li Yiyi was thrown to the ground. Her face was filled with disbelief.

What did she hear?

“In the past, Ye Sen would never talk to her like that. ”

What was going on?

“No! Sen! You still love me! You must still love me!”Li Yiyi hugged ye Sen’s leg.

“Ye Sen kicked Li Yiyi away and looked at her, “Li Yiyi, if you don’t accompany me at sunset, who are you? Get lost! Don’t humiliate yourself anymore!” ”

“After saying this, Ye Sen opened the car door and started the engine to leave. ”

Li Yiyi couldn’t believe it was true.

Ye Sen loved her so much.

He even said that he had to have her.

Why would he treat her like this now?

During Zhengzhi’s lunch break.

Many employees came out to watch the show.

“”Some women! They’re really despicable! Our CEO ye has already said so, yet she’s still so shameless! I’m embarrassed for her!” ”

“”That’s right, that’s right!” ”

“”In the past, when our CEO ye was a deliveryman, she kicked CEO Ye. Now, when she saw CEO Ye’s meteoric rise, she shamelessly came up to him! If I were her, I would directly find a hole to hide in!” ”

“She should be unwilling. She could have become the boss’s wife! Now? It’s all for nothing!”

“Gold digger! serves her right!”

“These sarcastic words were like knives, cutting Li Yiyi’s body one by one. ”
