“The mechanism is here.”Yi Ling flew to a book and stopped. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Ye Zhuo picked up the book and turned it.

Rumble —

The two rows of bookshelves filled with books immediately separated.

“Looking at it this way, the secret passage was about 100 meters long and the inside was as bright as day. ”

Ye Zhuo walked in.

“As soon as he walked in, the two rows of bookshelves behind him automatically merged. ”

“Yi Ling immediately stuck her little head out of her backpack. “Holy Sh * t, the bookshelves are closed! What if they lock us inside and we can’t Get Out?” ”

“”They won’t,”ye Zao said. ”

“With ye Zao’s words, Yi Ling felt much more at ease. She continued, “Oh right, Great Zao, there shouldn’t be any surveillance and defense systems inside, right?” ”

“Ye Zao raised his right hand lightly, and the watch on his wrist immediately turned into a small scanner. ”

Di Di di di —

“A moment later, ye Zao put away the scanner. “Don’t worry, there aren’t any.” ”

“Hearing that, Yi Ling immediately flew out of her pocket. ”

“The deeper they went, the brighter the light, but the brighter the light, the more eerie it made people feel. ”

They shuddered without feeling cold.

“All the hair on Yi Ling’s body stood up and curled up on Ye Zao’s shoulder. “Great Zao, this place is so strange!” ”

“It is indeed a little strange.”Ye Zao observed the environment in the secret passage without batting an eyelid.

“Boom Boom Boom –”

“At this moment, a strange sound came from the depths of the secret passage. ”

It was like the sound of iron chains knocking on an iron door.

“F * ck! There can’t be some man-eating monster hiding in Here!”Yi Ling was so scared that she hid her head in her fur.

“The deeper she went, the louder the sound became. ”

“In the end, there was even a scream of a human. ”

“Ah!”

“”Da, da searing, why, why don’t we go back! Don’t go in!”Yi Ling was so scared that her voice was trembling. “I, I’m a little scared!” ”

The fear of the unknown was more frightening than the fear of the known!

Because no one knew what kind of monster was hiding in the deepest part of the secret passage.

“Don’t panic.”Ye Zao’s tone was shallow. “I’m here.”

Yi Ling shrank into ye Zao’s shoulder again.

There was a turn ahead.

“If her guess was correct, the foreign object that made the sound was hiding there! ”

“Yi Ling stuck out her small head, wanting to see what was at the turn, but she was a little afraid. As soon as she stuck out her head, she covered her eyes with her wings! ”

“”Da Zhuolao, are you afraid?”Yi Ling asked. ”

“I’m not afraid.”Ye Zhuolao’s tone was as usual.

“I’m not afraid either!”Yi Ling said.

“Ye zhuolao smiled and said, “Take the wings off your eyes first before you say this.” ”

Yi Ling swallowed her throat. “I’m not afraid at all when I put the wings on my eyes. It’s because I like it this way!”

Ye Zhuolao did not point it out and continued walking inside.

“At the corner, there was a room that occupied more than twenty square meters. In the middle of the room was a huge iron cage! ”

The thing that made the noise was the thing that was locked in the iron cage.

“To be precise, the thing that was locked in the iron cage was a person. ”

The youth was about twenty years old.

His clothes were shabby.

His body was covered in dirt.

“Both his hands and feet were locked in iron chains. His eyes were dull, like a star that had lost its luster. ”

“It was as if the person locked in the cage was not a person, but an animal. It was even worse than an animal. ”

“Looking at it like this, it was unbearable. ”

“Seeing that ye Zhuo did not move for a long time, Yi Ling asked curiously, “Great Burning, have we arrived? Are the monsters scary?” ”

“There are no monsters. Open your eyes.”

There are no monsters!

“Hearing this, Yi Ling carefully removed her wings. ”

“Although there was no monster, seeing the scene in front of her, Yi Ling was still shocked. ”

A person!

How could it be a person!

There was actually a person locked in the iron cage.

“”Who, who is he?”Yi Ling continued, “Why is he locked up here?” ”

“Ye Zhuo looked at the youth. After a while, his red lips opened slightly, “If I’m not wrong, this person should be the only son of the six clan leaders, Guangxing.” ”

“Guangxing?”Yi Ling asked.

It was true that the sixth clan leader had a son.

“However, his son had already entered the military academy and was currently training at the Military Academy. He was an outstanding military officer. ”

The person in front of him did not even have the slightest bit of connection with Guangxing.

“”There’s been a mistake, there’s been a mistake!”Yi Ling said, “Great Burning, you must have made a mistake! How can he be guangxing? Guangxing hasn’t graduated yet!” ”

“He is guangxing.”Ye Zhuolao then took out his laptop and entered the Changyue State database to investigate Guangxing’s information.

The information recorded everything that happened before Guangxing was 15 years old.
