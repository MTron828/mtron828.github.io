He couldn’t just die trying to save face and suffer.

It’s not too late to make amends.

“No matter what, he had to successfully join Big C District! ”

“Thinking of this, old nie hurriedly walked toward Big C district. ”

“Soon, he arrived at Yu Zifei’s office. ”

The office door was closed.

There was a secretary standing guard outside.

Old Nie was stopped by the secretary. “May I know who you’re looking for?”

“I’m looking for Yu Zifei.”

The secretary looked at Old Nie. “Team leader Yu isn’t available right now. Do you have an appointment?”

“Hearing this, old nie felt even more upset. ”

Yu Zifei was indeed different from before.

“In the past, Yu Zifei was just an ordinary officer. Now, he even had to make an appointment to see Yu Zifei! ”

“He was Yu Zifei’s teacher and his abilities were above Yu Zifei’s. If he had not left Big C district, his current status would definitely be higher than Yu Zifei’s! ”

“Old Nie shook his head. “I didn’t make an appointment, but I’m your team leader Yu’s teacher. Go in and tell him that he will definitely come out to see me.” ”

“”Then please wait a moment.”The secretary continued, “I’ll go in and ask team leader Yu.” ”

“Old Nie nodded. “Alright, I’ll have to trouble you.” ”

The secretary turned around and entered the office.

Ten minutes later.

The office door opened again.

“Hearing the sound of the door opening, old Nie stood up from his chair and his eyes lit up. “Zifei.” ”

“”Teacher,”yu zifei said politely, “Why did you come to look for me?” ”

“Seeing the bright and beautiful Yu Zifei, old Nie’s eyes dimmed a little. ”

“If he hadn’t made the wrong choice, he wouldn’t have ended up like this! ”

“Old Nie tried his best to smile. “Zifei, do you have the time now? Teacher wants to talk to you.” ”

Yu Zifei looked at his watch. “Please come in with me.”

“No matter what, Old Nie was still his teacher. Although old Nie had gone overboard before, as his disciple, he didn’t add insult to injury. ”

“If he added insult to injury at this time, then he would be no different from old nie from before. ”

“Okay.”Old Nie followed Yu Zifei’s footsteps and entered the office together.

“After entering the office, old NIE realized that Yu Zifei’s office was the highest standard! It was even better than his environment in the Tang family’s laboratory! ”

It seemed that old Zhou was right. Yu Zifei was indeed a popular person in front of Ye Zhuo!

“Yu Zifei made a cup of tea for old nie. “Teacher, have some tea first.” ”

“”Thank you.”Old Nie picked up the Teacup and took a sip. Then, he looked up at Yu Zifei and went straight to the point, “Zifei, I won’t beat around the bush. I’m here to ask you for a favor! “In the past, it was all teacher’s fault. It was teacher’s shortsightedness. Can you help teacher? “Teacher wants to return to Big C district and rejoin Miss Ye’s team.” ”

“Looking at Yu Zifei’s current attitude, he still had him as a teacher in his heart. ”

This matter shouldn’t be difficult.

“Hearing this, Yu Zifei said regretfully, “Teacher, I’m sorry. I might not be able to help you with this matter.” ”

“”Why?”Old Nie was anxious and continued, “Zifei, you’re now the most popular person beside Miss Ye. As long as you ask, Miss Ye will definitely agree to it!” ”

“Yu Zifei frowned slightly, “Teacher, I know that you have no other choice, so you came to me! But I’m sorry, I really can’t help you. Do you still remember what you said to miss ye when you left the Greater C Zone?” ”

“Hearing this, old Nie was stunned. ”

“At that time, Ye Zhuo told old nie not to regret it and said that he only had one chance. It was easy to leave the greater C zone, but it would be difficult to join the greater C zone again! ”

“Yu Zifei continued, “Teacher, Miss Ye hates betrayal the most.” ”

The meaning behind Yu Zifei’s words was already very obvious.

It was impossible for ye Zhuo to agree to a person like old nie rejoining the large C zone.

“Old nie sighed and continued, “Zifei, although that’s what you said, how would you know if Miss Ye doesn’t agree if you don’t try?” ”

Yu Zifei clearly didn’t want to help him!

“If it wasn’t for him, would Yu Zifei have been able to enter the greater C area? ”

Yu Zifei had completely forgotten all these things now!

This was a little ungrateful!

“Yu Zifei continued, “Teacher, I’ve been by Miss Ye’s side a lot. I know her character very well! Furthermore, you spoke so harshly when you left back then. Do you think Miss Ye will let you re-enter the greater C area?” ”

“”Zifei, are you not planning to help me?”Old Nie put down his cup and looked up at Yu Zifei. ” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“”I’m sorry,”Yu Zifei said. ”

“Old Nie glared at Yu Zifei, he continued, “Yu Zifei, don’t forget. If it wasn’t for me back then, you wouldn’t have been able to join the greater C zone at all. Everything you have today is because of me! Yet, you forgot about this in the blink of an eye!” ”
