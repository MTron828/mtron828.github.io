“”Alright.”Gu Si nodded and took the report from leader Fang. With a glance, she could see the hidden problems, she continued, “Here, here, and here are all wrong. Although the Martian soil is similar to Earth’s soil, there are still many differences, such as the quality and organic matter. Take a careful look.” ”

“Hearing this, team leader Fang came to a sudden realization, he nodded and said, “So there’s something wrong with these places. No wonder I haven’t found out the reason! An expert is an expert. Once he makes a move, he can beat us all! By the way, worker Gu, I heard that Mars has successfully grown potatoes? I wonder if it’s true?” ”

“Gu Si shook her head. “I’m not from the OASIS project team, so I’m not very sure either.” ”

“Many things about the oasis project were kept secret from the outside world. Even if Gu Si knew about it, she couldn’t say it out loud. ”

“”I see!”Team leader Fang continued, “Alright then, thank you, Gu. I still have to go back to the office first.” ”

“”You’re welcome,”Gu si continued. ”

“After saying that, team leader Fang turned around and went back to the office. ”

“Just as he reached the corner, team leader Fang took out his phone and sent a message. ”

On the other side.

“Sitting in the car, Jamila received a message from an insider. ”

This was a schedule.

“Looking at Gu Si’s schedule for the day, Jamila narrowed her eyes. ”

“Gu Si was different from Liu Yuan. Liu Yuan had an influential grandfather in her family, and her patriotic thoughts were carved from her bones. ”

As for Gu Si?

“She was born in an ordinary family and had a poor life, but she still had a family. ”

“In a big city like Beijing, it was almost too difficult for Gu si to survive beautifully with his family. ”

Therefore.

Gu Si was no different from what he had in his bag.

“In a moment, Jamila sent another message to him, setting up a meeting time. ”

“After receiving Jamila’s message, team leader Fang took advantage of the lunch break to go to the restaurant that he had arranged with Jamila. ”

“Mr. Jamila.”

“”Team leader Fang, please take a seat.”Jamila made a ‘please’gesture. ”

Team leader Fang sat opposite Jamila.

“Jamila looked at team leader Fang and asked, “How are things on Mars? I heard that YC is implementing the OASIS project.” ”

“Team leader Fang said, “The aircraft carrier was launched three months ago. It is said that potatoes have been planted on Mars, but this claim has not been confirmed, so I am not very sure.” ”

“After thinking for a while, team leader Fang continued, “There has been no news about the OASIS project for a long time.” ”

There has been no news for a long time?

“Hearing this, Jamila narrowed her eyes. If the oasis project went smoothly, there would not be no news from ye Zao’s side. ”

Could it be...

The Oasis project failed?

“If it really failed, it would not be surprising. ”

“After all, the conditions on Mars were terrible, and they did not have the conditions to survive. ”

It was simply a pipe dream to plant an oasis on Mars!

“However, ye Zao had completed one seemingly impossible mission after another, creating one miracle after another. Before confirming the situation, Jamila could not easily make a conclusion. ”

What if ye Zao made another reversal?

“Are you familiar with the person in charge of the Oasis Project?”Jamila asked.

“Not really.”Team leader Fang shook his head.

“He was from Area B, so all the news was just hearsay. Yu Zifei, Cen He, and the others were praised so highly, so how could he have the chance to get in touch with them? ”

“Jamila took out a check and said, “Check all these things out, and this check is all yours.” ”

Team leader Fang glanced at it.

“Ten, a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand, a hundred thousand, a million... ”

It was a total of seven figures!

It was close to his annual salary at the Cen family’s experimental base!

This money was enough to cover all the expenses of raising a small family outside.

“Team leader Fang’s eyes were filled with greed. He smiled and said, “Don’t worry, Mr. Jamila. I will definitely not disappoint your expectations.” ”

Jamila nodded in satisfaction. “I believe in team leader Fang’s ability.” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“After saying that, Jamila continued, “There’s one more thing.” ”

“”Please speak,”team leader Fang said. ”

“Jamila said, “What about Liu Yuan?” ”

“Before this, Jamila had only gotten a partial understanding of Liu Yuan’s situation from the information. ”

He was afraid that there would be some mistakes.

But team leader Fang was different. Team leader Fang and Liu Yuan were colleagues from the same base. He could get to Know Liu Yuan more directly.

“Team leader Fang said, “Although Liu Yuan is also professor Feng’s disciple, there are still some differences between her and Gu si. “Liu Yuan was born with real roots. I think you’d better not waste your time with her!”Not to mention that Liu Yuan’s grandfather was a veteran, just based on the fact that Liu Yuan broke up with her ex-boyfriend because he had a quarter of the Japanese bloodline, it could be seen that Liu Yuan would never do anything to let down the CEN base. ”
