“Do you want to have a bite?”

Ye Zhuo passed the potato chips that he had bitten to Cen Shaoqing’s mouth.

Cen Shaoqing opened his mouth and bit off half of the potato chips that ye Zhuo had bitten.

“Is it good?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“”It’s good.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and continued, “What do you want to eat next?””

“Roast a squid.”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing picked up a skewer of squid.

“After eating the last skewer of potato chips, ye Zao stood up and said, “I’m going to the bathroom.””

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Seeing ye Zao walking towards the bathroom, song Chenyu raised his head and looked at Cen Yuyan. “Yuyan, please help me watch the fire for a while. I’m going to the bathroom.””

“Alright.”Cen Yuyan nodded.

Song Chenyu followed ye Zhuo to the washroom.

“When she entered, Ye Zhuo was standing in front of the sink washing his hands.”

Song Chenyu walked over with a smile. “Miss Ye.”

Ye Zhuo nodded at her.

“Song Chenyu took off the bracelet on her wrist, “Miss Ye, I just bought this bracelet a few days ago. It’s still new today. A good thing should go well with a beauty like you. It’s just a small token of appreciation. I hope Miss Ye will accept it.””

Song Chenyu was a smart person. She knew that she could not make an enemy out of ye Zao.

She had to curry favor with ye Zao and strive to make ye Zao and Cen Yuyan become good friends who could talk to her about anything.

“As the saying goes, know yourself and know your enemy, and you will win every battle.”

“From upstairs, song Chenyu could tell that ye Zao liked the bracelet on her hand very much. Therefore, it was very suitable to use this bracelet to bribe ye Zao.”

“For a girl like ye Zao, with Cen Shaoqing’s affection for her, she should feel that the whole world should treat her well unconditionally.”

“Therefore, Ye Zao would definitely accept this bracelet as a matter of course.”

“Thank you.”Ye Zao rejected tactfully. “I won’t accept a reward for nothing. I appreciate miss song’s kindness.”

“Song Chenyu was stunned. She did not expect ye Zao to reject her. The smile on her face remained unchanged, “Miss Ye, you’re being too polite with your words. You’re Fifth Master’s girlfriend, and Yuyan and I are good friends. With this calculation, we’re not outsiders! Isn’t it just a bracelet? Miss Ye, you can keep it with ease. Only by wearing this bracelet on Miss Ye’s wrist can it reflect its value!””

“Song Chenyu was indeed a person who worked in the entertainment industry. After a round of pretty words, it almost made people dizzy.”

“Unfortunately, Ye Zhuo was never the kind of person who listened to beautiful words.”

“Moreover, song Chenyu was a person who was very shrewd and good at disguising himself. It was too tiring to deal with such people.”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “There’s really no need. I have one of these bracelets too.”Every Time Ye Zhuo handed over the design drafts, nine miles would send her a copy of the finished product, after she confirmed that there were no problems, they would continue to produce.”

“However, almost all the samples sent over were given away by Ye Zao.”

She rarely wore these jewelry.

Ye Zao also had one?

“Song Chenyu felt that ye Zao was trying to make a fool of himself. If ye Zao really had one, then he would not be attracted to her bracelet.”

“”Miss Ye, it’s just a bracelet. You really don’t have to be polite with me.””

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Miss Song, did you buy this bracelet from director Jiu Li?””

Song Chenyu nodded. “Yes.”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Logically speaking, director Jiu Li would definitely not cheat you with the imitation. “Then there must be some misunderstanding. If I remember correctly, when Gui Chen was designing the bracelet, he specially left a C mark on the bracelet buckle so that everyone could better distinguish the authenticity. Miss song, the C mark on your bracelet is not only very shallow, but there are also scratches. For the sake of caution, I think you should go and ask Mr. Jiu Li What’s going on.””

Ye Zao did not want to say so much in front of Song Chenyu.

“However, this fish was too full of nonsense.”

“Since song Chenyu was in a hurry to embarrass her, she would fulfill her wish.”

“Upon hearing this, song Chenyu’s expression changed. She immediately picked up the bracelet and looked at it carefully.”

The C mark on the clasp of her bracelet was indeed a little blurry...

Could it be that her bracelet was fake?

Ye Zao ignored song Chenyu and turned around to walk outside.

“Song Chenyu, who was inside, only reacted after a long while.”

She originally wanted to use the bracelet to bribe ye Zao.

“Who would have thought that not only did she fail to bribe ye Zao, but she was even slapped by Ye Zao... ! ... Ye Zao recognized that it was a fake!”

A fake!

Song Chenyu never would have thought that a daigou that she had worked with for three years would actually dare to sell her a fake.

How could she know HT’s director Jiuli? !

“In order to buy this limited edition necklace, she had spent nearly five times more than the original price.”

She did not expect to still buy the fake goods.

Song Chenyu was very upset that she had lost so much face in front of ye Zhuo.

“Song Chenyu had always been cautious in doing things. This was the first time that she had suffered a loss in front of others. Not only had she lost so much face, but ye Zhuo had also discovered that she did not know HT’s Jiuli at all.”

“Looking in the direction that ye Zhuo had left, song Chenyu frowned.”

“After a long while, song Chenyu finally composed himself and came out of the bathroom.”

“Seeing song Chenyu, Cen Yuyan waved at her excitedly. “Chenyu, Chenyu! Quickly come over and take a look. These are the chicken wings that I roasted. What do you think?””

“This was the first time that Cen Yuyan, the daughter of a rich family, had roasted chicken wings. Looking at the chicken wings that she had roasted, she felt a special sense of accomplishment.”

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “Good, very good! Yuyan, your first time roasting chicken wings like this is really not bad. I remember the first time i roasted chicken wings, I burnt the chicken wings into charcoal.””

“Cen Yuyan was even happier when she heard this. She handed the chicken wings to Lu Xiu and said, “Mr. Lu, this is my first work in my life. I’ll treat you to it.””

“Thank you.”Lu Xiu reached out and took it.

“Cen Yuyan noticed that song Chenyu’s wrist was bare. She asked curiously, “Yuyan, where’s your bracelet?””

“Song Chenyu’s expression remained the same. “I accidentally scratched the wall just now, so I took it off.””

“OH.”Cen Yuyan didn’t think too much about it.

“Song Chenyu continued, “Yuyan, is miss ye very familiar with Mr. Jiuli?””

“Her?”Cen Yuyan frowned. “She probably doesn’t know HT’s Jiuli.”

“If ye Zao didn’t know Jiuli, then why did she know so much about the bracelet designed by God Gui Chen?”

Could it be that she did her homework online?

“If ye Zao was also boasting, then she definitely wouldn’t dare to say that she didn’t know director Jiuli at all...”

Song Chenyu heaved a sigh of relief in her heart.

“In fact, Ye Zao didn’t put song Chenyu in his eyes at all.”

...

“As the new year’s Day was getting closer and closer, the three brothers of the Lin family rushed back from the east, west, and south respectively. During the reunion dinner that night, Old Lady Lin talked about Lin Qingxuan’s personal matters.”

“Lin qingxuan smiled and said, “Mom, I know you’re anxious, so I’ve decided to find a day to bring her back for everyone to see.””

“Really?”Old Mrs. Lin’s eyes lit up.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com
