“Feng Xianxian’s eyes were filled with ridicule. “Even if she wasn’t kept by someone, she’s probably a shameless mistress! I think that old man’s family should even have a grandson!” ”

“At the mention of a mistress, Feng Xianxian’s eyes were filled with hatred. ”

“If it wasn’t for Ye Shu, she would have long been the miss of the Lin Family! ”

Why did she have to wait until now?

All the mistresses deserved to die!

“Bai Xiaoman said with some regret, “If we had known earlier, we should have taken a picture with that phone! Let the whole school know ye Zao’s true face! Let’s see how she will face others in the future!” ”

“Feng xianxian smiled, “There’s no rush. There’s still a chance in the future. How can a Fox not show its tail!”The higher she stood, the more miserable she fell. Ye Zao’s good days were still ahead! ”

“”Xianxian, you’re right!” ”

“Soon, the Bentley stopped at the entrance of the CEN Group. ”

Ye Zao pushed the door open and got out. He walked into the company Hall.

“As Ye Zao entered, everyone looked over. ”

“Although this was only the second time ye Zao had come to the CEN Group, everyone had a deep impression of her. They whispered, “Madam President is here again!” ”

“”Holy Sh * t, Holy Sh * t! I’ve finally seen someone alive! Madam President’s clothes look so good!” ”

“I want to buy a suspenders shirt and wide-legged pants too!”

“”The most important thing is that the person looks good, right? For a clothes rack like Madam President’s, even if she wears a sack, she would still look good.” ”

“Can you not be so prickly? I’m ready to place the Order!”

Ye Zhuo walked all the way to the CEO’s private elevator and stopped.

Ding —

The elevator door opened and she walked in. The elevator went straight to the top floor.

“After a few seconds, the elevator stopped at the top floor. ” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“A secretary was waiting at the elevator door. “Miss Ye, this way please.” ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Where’s Your Fifth Master?”

“The secretary said respectfully, “Fifth Master is having a meeting in the conference room.” ”

Ye Zhuo did not ask any more questions and followed the secretary into CEN Shaoqing’s office.

“The secretary was busy making tea for ye Zao and getting snacks. “Fifth master asked me to tell you that the computer password is your birthday. If you want to play with the computer, you can play with his computer.” ”

“After the incident with the CEO’s wife had spread in the group, the secretary was still wondering if these two were just friends. After all, CEN fifth master was famous for not getting close to women. ”

Until the secretary found out that Cen Shaoqing’s computer password was actually ye Zhuo’s birthday.

Would a normal friend use the other party’s birthday to set the password?

It looked like CEN group was about to have a lady boss!

“”Okay.”Ye Zhuo continued, “You can go out first.” ”

“The secretary nodded. “My name is Clark. If there’s anything, you can just call me from the Secretary Department outside.” ”

“Okay.”

“After the secretary left, only ye Zhuo was left in the office. ”

Ye Zhuo ate a dessert and suddenly remembered that he had not livestreamed for a long time.

So he turned on his computer and started livestreaming.

“[ F * ck! F * CK, Yezi is here! ] ”

[ why did Yezi change the location of the livestream? Is this your company? ]

“”No, this is my boyfriend’s office,”ye Zhuo replied. ”

Boyfriend?

“When he heard this word, the bullet screen exploded. ”

[ ye has a boyfriend? ]

[ Ah Ah Ah! I’m heartbroken! ]

[ I really want to see Ye’s boyfriend... ]

“[ ye has a boyfriend, what about the beauty boss? ] ”

[ Wuli the beauty boss is so pitiful. ]

[ my heart aches for the beauty boss! ]

“[ wait! Ye’s boyfriend can’t be the beauty boss, right? ] ”

“The moment he said that, it attracted a group of onlookers. ”

“Ye Zhuo explained, “My boyfriend met him in real life, not the beauty boss! Oh right, I’ll broadcast chess for you guys first today, right? Then, if time permits, we’ll play Lol again.” ”

[ user: heaven-toppling Earth Purple Gold Hammer 1225 gives out ten sports cars! ]

[ user: that dog gave out 10 cloud piercing arrows! ]

“[ hammer Bro and dog bro are both here! Now, only beauty boss is left. ] ”

[ beauty boss is sad. ]

Ye Zao started his live broadcast of chess.

“He originally thought that he would receive an invitation from the unlucky guy again today, but the unlucky guy did not go online today. ”

“Thus, ye Zao randomly matched a chess streamer. ”

“Ten minutes later, a game of chess ended. ”

[ ye Zao is Amazing! ]

“[ I always thought that the unlucky guy was stupid and always lost to ye Zao, but now I realize that the unlucky guy is also a master. ] ”

[ one more upstairs. ]

“After the live broadcast of chess, Ye Zao began to play Lol. ”

“Cen Shaoqing pushed open the office door and saw Ye Zao sitting in front of his desk playing games. He was wearing headphones and staring at the screen with full concentration. One hand was pressing the mouse, and the other hand was quickly jumping on the keyboard. ”
