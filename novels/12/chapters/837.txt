“Chapter 838: 183: Little Half Moon is still alive, a worthless trinket! 4”

Translator: 549690339

This was unfair to Little Half Moon.

“Little Half Moon had been lost for more than 30 years. If one day she came back and found that she already had a replacement by her side, then Little Half Moon would be heartbroken. ”

No.

It couldn’t be like that.

“Xi Weiyue did not want to give up such a good opportunity to attack her heart, because she knew that tonight was ye Langhua’s most vulnerable moment. When a person was at their most vulnerable, they needed to care and accompany them. ”

“”Aunty, let me accompany you. My father said that I look like Sister Half Moon, so you should look at me more. Look at me, maybe you won’t Miss Sister Half Moon so much.” ”

Looking like Ye Half Moon was also Xi Weiyue’s greatest asset.

Unless the Dead Ye Half Moon returned.

“Otherwise, no one could threaten her position. ”

“”No need.”Aunty Lang rejected, “Weiyue, you go back.” ”

“Aunt...”

Aunt Lang closed the door and Shut XI Weiyue outside. “Go Back!”

Xi Weiyue frowned as she looked at the closed door.

This trick again!

This heartless Old Woman!

Did she really think she wanted to accompany her?

She thought she was something!

Xi Weiyue even had the urge to kick the door open.

“”Aunt, please open the door. I’m really worried about you.” ”

“Aunt.”

Xi Weiyue reached out and knocked on the door.

“”Weiyue, you can go back now.”Aunt Lang’s voice came from inside the door. ”

“Xi Weiyue was unwilling to leave just like that. “Aunt, please let me accompany you.” ”

“Aunt Lang’s voice came from inside again. “Weiyue, if you don’t Leave Now, I won’t have a niece like you in the future.” ”

Her tone was very serious.

Xi Weiyue’s face was full of anger.

“Damn old hag, she even learned to threaten her. ”

“If it wasn’t for the treasure map and the Shunxi Financial Group, she wouldn’t even look at her. ”

“Xi Weiyue tried hard to calm herself down, then she said, “Aunt, don’t be angry, I’ll leave now.” ”

There was no sound in the room.

Xi Weiyue walked out of the courtyard.

“When she saw Xi Weiyue come out, Xiaomei said in surprise, “Miss Weiyue, why are you out? Didn’t you say you were going to accompany Aunt Lang Tonight?” ”

The smile on Xi Weiyue’s face did not change. “Aunt doesn’t want me to accompany her.”

“Then why are you going back now?”

“MMM.”Xi Weiyue nodded.

“Then I’ll send you off.”Xiaomei followed Xi Weiyue’s footsteps.

“The two of them walked out of the door, and XI Weiyue turned to look inside. “Sister Xiaomei, I remember that you’ve been working at my aunt’s place for four to five years, right?” ”

“Xiaomei smiled and said, “It’s been five years. When I first came to the shop, I was still single, and now my daughter is already three years old.” ”

“”Time really flies!”Xi Weiyue sighed, then, she said, “My aunt’s health has been getting worse all these years. It’s all thanks to you guys. If anything happens, you have to inform me immediately.” ”

“”Miss Weiyue, don’t worry. This is what we should do.” ”

“At that moment, Xi Weiyue suddenly stopped in her tracks. She reached out to grab Xiao Mei’s hand and conveniently took off the bracelet on Xiao Mei’s wrist. ”

“Xiao Mei was shocked by Xi Weiyue’s sudden action. “Miss Weiyue, what are you doing?” ”

“XI weiyue smiled and said, “I have a lot of jewelry. I’ll give it to you now.” ”

“”Miss Weiyue, I can’t take this expensive thing!”Xiao Mei directly rejected. ”

“XI weiyue said indifferently, “It’s just a worthless trinket. What’s there to refuse?” ”

A worthless trinket? 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Xiao Mei’s face was filled with shock.

“If she was not mistaken, this was LK, a true luxury item. Just this bracelet alone could not be bought without 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. ”

“But...”Xiao Mei was still a little hesitant.

“XI weiyue continued, “Sister Xiao Mei, what I Gave You is yours. If you don’t want it, then throw it in the trash can!” ”

“Xiaomei naturally could not bear to throw such an expensive thing into the trash can. “Then, then thank you, Miss Weiyue.” ”

“”What’s so good about that, but,”at this point, Xi Weiyue changed the topic and continued, “Sister Xiaomei, if you really want to thank me, then help me out?” ”

“”What favor, Miss Weiyue, did you say that?”Xiaomei asked. ”

“XI weiyue sighed and continued, “As you know, my aunt hasn’t been well, so I want you to take good care of her.” ”

“”Don’t worry about that. Even if you don’t tell me, I’ll take good care of Aunt Lang,”Xiaomei said. ”

“XI weiyue continued, “Also... ... also, I want you to keep an eye out for the people my aunt sees every day, what kind of car they drive, and the license plate number. Record it and send it to me once a week.” ”

“As long as ye Langhua kept in contact with the Shunxi Financial Group, she would definitely give herself away. ”

“Xiao Mei hesitated for a moment, then nodded. “Sure, Miss Weiyue, do you have any other instructions?” ”

“”Then, I’ll ask you another question.” ”

“Please Ask.”

Xi Weiyue narrowed her eyes. “Is there a VIP customer in the shop who’s wearing a vintage long gown with a string of Buddhist beads in his hand?”

“”Yes.”Xiao Mei had a deep impression of Cen Shaoqing. After all, there were not many people like Cen Shaoqing in the capital. ”

“Xi Weiyue’s eyes lit up when she heard this. She continued, “Then who is he? What’s his name?” ”

Xiao Mei shook her head. “I’m not too sure about the specifics. I only know that the gentleman’s surname is Cen. Aunt Lang personally receives Mr. Cen every time he comes over.”
