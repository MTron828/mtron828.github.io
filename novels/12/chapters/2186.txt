Even an ordinary person wouldn’t be able to survive ten years in prison.

Not to mention a wealthy man and his wife.

“Master Cao looked at man Xing and said, “As parents, you can give up everything for your children. Even if Mr. and Mrs. Know About your decision, I think they will support you and not hold you back. By doing this, you are helping them and yourself.” ”

Master Cao understood Manjiang and Zhao Dan too well.

The two of them were willing to give up their lives for the sake of Manxing.

“Must we do this?”Manxing asked.

“Yes.”Master Cao nodded.

“Manxing took a deep breath and looked at master cao, “Alright, I’ll listen to you.” ”

“Master Cao said with great satisfaction, “Xing ‘er, you’re really sensible now!” ”

Man Xing lowered his head and did not say anything.

“Master Cao continued, “Now is not the time to make a move. Go and issue an apology statement first. I don’t need to teach you the specifics, right?” ”

“”Yes, I know.”Man Xing nodded. ”

“Not long after, man Xing appeared in front of the camera with red eyes. ”

“”Hello, everyone. I Am Man Xing. First of all, I would like to apologize to everyone here. I know that I no longer have the right to stand in front of everyone, but I must say this apology.”Man Xing tried his best to hold back his tears, then, he said, “I have always wanted to find my eldest sister. What I didn’t know was that the murderer was actually my parents, whom I have always respected and loved. When I heard this news, I suddenly felt as if the entire sky had collapsed. I couldn’t believe that it was true, and I couldn’t believe that my parents were executioners... “... It’s all my fault. If I had found out earlier that my eldest sister had been thrown away by them, I would definitely have gone to look for her. If I had found my eldest sister, she wouldn’t have suffered so much and died in the end.” ”

“Speaking up to this point, Manxing was already sobbing uncontrollably, causing others to cry as well. ”

“”Finally, I want to apologize to Miss Ye. Miss Ye, I’m very sorry for causing you trouble!”Manxing bowed, “Since things have come to this, I no longer ask for your forgiveness. I only hope that your mood will not be affected by this matter. I’m Sorry!” ”

“[ Miss Manxing, actually, you don’t have to blame yourself so much. This isn’t your fault at all. ] ”

“[ you are you, your parents are your parents. Don’t worry, we won’t blame you. ] ”

“[ Miss Manxing is really too miserable. It’s one thing for her to have such excellent parents, but now she has to clean up their mess! ] ”

“[ sigh, seeing Princess Manxing cry, I can’t help it. ] ”

“[ don’t worry, Miss Ye is a busy person. She doesn’t have time to care about these things. ] ”

[ why do I feel that Manxing is acting a little? ]

“[ whoever says that Miss Manxing is acting, I’ll be angry with them! ] ”

“[ sisters, don’t be angry with this kind of person. Their eyes have grown to the anus. Otherwise, why would miss Manxing Cry Like This? They can’t even see! ] ”

Manxing had always been a very good person in manxing country.

“As a princess, she was neither arrogant nor impatient. She did not have the airs of a princess, especially when she was close to the people. Most importantly, not only was Manxing beautiful, she was also talented. ”

“She was not like Manwen. As a prince, she did not even have the slightest bit of dignity that a prince should have. ”

“Therefore, when the video of Manxing’s apology was released, everyone could express their understanding of her. A small number of people who doubted her were also criticized by others. ”

“The moment she turned off the camera, full star’s expression instantly changed from sadness to impatience. She picked up a tissue and wiped her face. ”

...

At the same time.

In the main ally country.

“It was the first time Lin Jincheng, Ye Shu, and Lin Ze had come to the s galaxy. Ye Zhuo planned to accompany them to take a good look around the main ally country. ”

It was as if they were out on a vacation.

It was not easy for them to have a break when they were out.

There was a very beautiful scenic spot in the General Alliance.

“The sea water there was very blue, and the sky was also very blue. It was almost the same color as the water and the sky. There were all kinds of mushrooms that were bigger than umbrellas growing on the beach. The beach was golden, and the sunlight was very strong, but it would not burn the skin. There was no need to worry about getting sunburned, there was also a very rare seven-colored flower in the forest by the beach. It was like being in a fairytale world, making people forget to return. ”

“Ye Zhuo sat on the sofa in the living room, playing with his phone while waiting for Lin Jincheng and ye Shu. ”

Lin Ze came out after changing his clothes. “Mom and Dad haven’t finished yet?”

“”Not yet.”Ye Zhuo continued, “Brother, get me a sorghum malt.” ”

Lin Ze grabbed a handful of sorghum malt and very considerately handed a glass of water to Ye Zhuo.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m
