Tonight was her apprenticeship banquet.

“If ye Zao came, what else could it be? ”

“Feng Qianqian looked at ye Zao, the corners of her mouth curling up. ”

“Old Lady Lin followed Feng Qianqian’s gaze and saw ye Zao as well. She frowned slightly. When she came, she did not call for ye Zao. ”

She did not expect ye Zao to come on his own.

“This kind of literary banquet was attended by scholars. If Master Yu did not give her face, would he have asked ye Zao to come? ”

Ye Zao must have come here because he was envious of Feng Xianxian.

But could such things be envied?

“If she was half as outstanding as Feng Xianxian, master Yu would not have only accepted Feng Xianxian as his disciple! ”

Master Yu was really too much.

He didn’t even discuss with her before asking ye Zao to come over.

“If she knew about this matter, she definitely wouldn’t have asked ye Zao to come over. ”

11 am.

The master-apprentice banquet officially began.

“There was a total of two seats in the hall, two main seats and two secondary seats. ”

Old Lady Lin brought Feng Xianxian to the main seat.

Ye Zao sat in the secondary seat.

“Looking at Ye Zao in the second seat, Feng Xianxian’s eyes were filled with mockery. ” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

A person like ye Zao was only fit to sit in the second seat.

Master Yu did not reveal any information about ye Zao in advance.

“Therefore, no one in the second seat knew ye Zao. ”

Ye Zao also fell into silence. He lowered his eyes and looked at his phone.

She was very pretty. Just sitting there like this was a beautiful scenery.

Everyone looked at her.

“Which family’s daughter is that?”

“Could she be Master Yu’s granddaughter?”

“She looks like it!”

“A graceful figure walked over and said with a smile, “Master Yu only has a nine-year-old grandson. He doesn’t have a granddaughter.” ”

“Miss Caiyi.”

“When they saw her, everyone at the second table stood up to greet her, except for Ye Zhuo. ”

“This person was called Liu Caiyi, the vice president of the Chinese Painting Association. ”

“Although she was only in her early twenties, she already had a seat in the Chinese painting world. Her future was bright and limitless. ”

The literary world and the Chinese painting world were all connected.

“Therefore, everyone wanted to be on good terms with Liu Caiyi. ”

“After all, connections were not something that could be bought with money. ”

Liu Caiyi dealt with the crowd in a familiar manner.

Her gaze swept past ye Zao.

One had to say.

Her appearance and temperament were too eye-catching.

Liu Caiyi was also very curious about who this girl was.

“Logically speaking, the people who came today were all outstanding figures in the literary world. Other than Master Yu’s successor, there should not be such a young girl. ”

But according to what she knew.

“Master Yu’s new disciple was the Lin family’s old lady’s default granddaughter, Feng Xianxian. ”

Could it be...

That this was the Lin family’s biological granddaughter?

“Looking at Feng Xianxian who sat next to Old Lady Lin, a faint light flashed in Liu Caiyi’s eyes. ”

It seemed that the rumors were right.

The Lin family’s biological granddaughter was not favored in the Lin family.

“This Old Lady Lin was really interesting. She did not get close to her biological granddaughter, but instead went to get close to an outsider. ”

11:28 pm.

The banquet officially began.

“The host on the stage introduced the main procedure of today’s master-apprentice banquet. “Today is Master Yu’s important day to accept a disciple. Now, I invite Master Yu to come up and introduce his beloved disciple to everyone.” ”

Offstage.

Feng Xianxian was extremely excited.

She had finally made her appearance.

Feng Xianxian’s nervous palms were covered in a layer of sweat.

Her heart was also beating very fast.

“Master Yu walked onto the stage. He first exchanged a few pleasantries before moving on to the main topic. His gaze landed on ye Zao, who was seated at the second seat. “Now, let’s invite my beloved disciple, the daughter of the Lin family, Ye Zao, to come up.” ”

The daughter of the Lin Family?

Ye Zao?

“Upon hearing this, everyone looked towards ye Zao, who was seated at the second seat. ”

Feng Xianxian and Old Lady Lin were stunned.

Old Lady Lin Never Expected Master Yu to take ye Zao as his disciple.

Feng Xianxian’s face turned pale.

Cold Sweat broke out on her back.

Ye Zao?

Didn’t master Yu Want to take her as his disciple?

Why did he suddenly turn into ye Zao?

What was going on?

Feng Xianxian could hardly control her emotions.

“Old Lady Lin held onto Feng Xianxian’s hand.”... Xianxian, I’m sorry. It’s all Grandma’s fault. Grandma didn’t get to the bottom of this!”At that time, master Yu said that he had decided to take her granddaughter as a disciple. ”

She subconsciously felt that this person was definitely Feng Xianxian.

But she didn’t expect that.

The granddaughter that master Yu was referring to was actually ye Zao.

Why was it ye Zao?

Could it be that something had gone wrong?

“Feng Xianxian tried her best to calm herself down. She squeezed out a sentence through the gaps of her teeth, “Grandma, I’m fine...” ”
