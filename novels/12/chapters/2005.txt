“Chapter 2006: 420: Trash! Miss ye will always be here, believing in more than one thing! 2”

“En.”Ye Zao nodded slightly. “There’s a lot of poisonous miasma in the red and Blue Mountains. Put on your gas mask.”

“Where’s the mask?”Yi Ling asked.

“”It’s in my bag,”ye Zao said. ”

Yi Ling retracted her little head and rummaged through it. “Ah! Found it! Is This It?”

Yi Ling took out a miniature mask and handed it to Ye Zao.

The mask was small and looked a little cute.

“”It’s this.”Ye Zao nodded slightly. As he spoke, he took out a black mask of the same style and put it on. ”

“Her skin was very white. The black mask on her face made her look black and white. In addition, she was wearing black clothes today. ”

It gave people a strong sense of abstinence.

Yi Ling also put on the mask.

“The red and Blue Mountain was more than 20,000 meters above sea level, which was about twice as high as the first peak on Earth. ” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“However, standing on the red and Blue Mountain, there was no need to worry about plateau reaction at all. ”

“Because the Changyue people had moved to planet E-TY889 for thousands of years, they had long been used to the environment of Planet E-TY889. ”

“”Da Zhuoluo, what monster are you here to fight?”Yi Ling followed behind ye Zhuoluo and asked curiously. ”

“Without waiting for ye Zhuoluo to answer, Yi ling screamed, “Ah!” ”

“What’s Wrong?”Ye Zhuoluo asked.

“”Isn’t That Ye Han in front?”Yi Ling continued, “Da Zhuoluo, you’re not here to look for him, right?” ”

“Ye Zhuoluo slightly raised his eyes. As expected, not far ahead, he saw a tall and familiar figure among a group of level three armored beasts. ”

Level three armored beasts were the most ferocious exotic beasts on Planet E-TY889.

“They were also the native exotic beasts of Planet E-TY889. Their average lifespan was over 500 years, similar to that of the Turtles on Earth. ”

Qiu Di wanted to sit on the seat of the female sovereign. It seemed that she wanted to use level three armored beasts to pave the way.

Each level three armored beast had dozens of very bright blood beads in their bodies.

“It was rumored that if the female monarch could walk on the path paved with blood pearls to the throne on the day of inheriting the throne, she would be blessed for ten thousand years and be immortal forever. ”

“Looking at the blood path that appeared behind ye Han, he had already killed nearly half of the level three armored beasts on the red and blue scales. ”

Ye Zhuo frowned slightly.

“Yi Ling flapped her wings and said angrily, “Ye Han, this traitor! Great Burning, just you wait, I’ll go and call him over right now!” ”

“Wait!”Ye Zhuo reached out and grabbed the back of Yi Ling’s neck.

“What’s Wrong?”Yi Ling turned to look at Ye Zhuo.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Someone installed a surveillance chip on him.” ”

“If Yi Ling went over now, it was no different from revealing her whereabouts. ”

“”Great Burning, you’re back now. Are you still afraid of revealing your whereabouts?”Yi Ling frowned. ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Before the mole is caught, I can’t reveal my whereabouts.” ”

“”Other than ye Han, who else is the mole?”Yi Ling asked. ”

Ye Zao looked in Ye Han’s direction and narrowed his beautiful eyes. “The feeling that ye Han gives me is more like he’s being controlled by someone.”

The current ye Han was like a marionette.

Someone else was pulling the strings.

“”Controlled by someone?”Yi Ling flapped her wings and continued, “Now that you mention it, I also feel that Ye Han is a little strange. He actually changed his surname! Do you think the Great Magus is behind this?” ”

“”Other than him, there should be someone else,”ye Zao said. ”

How could the Great Wizard Doctor alone have such abilities?

“Who else?”Yi Ling looked at Ye Zao. “Ye Lan?”

Ye Lan was the most important person in the Ye family base and was in charge of the core work of the Ye family base.

“After ye Zao’s accident, Ye Lan immediately defected to autumn flute and handed over the power of the Ye family base to autumn flute. There was no need to probe such a betrayal. ”

“Until now, there were still many people in the Ye family’s base who were unconvinced of ye Lan and autumn flute. ”

But they were all suppressed by Ye Lan.

“Ye Lan had followed behind ye Zao for so long, so she still had some tricks up her sleeve. ”

“”It’s not just ye Lan,”ye Zao said. ”

“Then who else is there?”Yi Ling asked curiously.

“”The eight great families,”ye Zao answered. ”

“Hearing this, Yi Ling’s face was full of shock, she said angrily, “Those eight old fellows are too inhuman! They forgot about what happened back then so quickly! If it wasn’t for you back then, the eight great clans would have long ceased to exist! It’s fine if they don’t know how to be grateful. Instead, they repay kindness with enmity!” ”

“If it wasn’t for ye Zao back then, how could the eight great clans have existed back then? ”

“They, on the other hand, forgot about what happened back then in the blink of an eye! ”

They were truly unscrupulous!

“”If you knew this would happen, you shouldn’t have saved them! Just let them die!”Yi Ling was so angry that her face was distorted. ”
