“Chapter 764: 170: face smacking, a worthy first place! 5”

“Li Zhentian looked at Liu Caiyi. “Vice president Liu, do you feel that something is unfair?” ”

“”The person who should have gotten a full score but didn’t get a full score, the person who shouldn’t have gotten a full score but relied on an imposter to stand on stage. Chief Li, by doing this, aren’t you afraid that everyone in the literary world will lose confidence in the literary world?” ”

Imposter?

“When these words were said, everyone was in an uproar. ”

Right!

Ye Zhuo must have been an imposter!

“Otherwise, how could she have gotten a full score? ”

It was impossible to think about it with her toes.

Li Zhentian looked at Liu Caiyi and his expression didn’t change. “Then who does vice-president Liu Think is the one who got a full score?”

“”Feng Qianqian.”Liu Caiyi continued, “I suspect now that someone deliberately changed Feng Qianqian and ye Zhuo’s test papers, causing their rankings to be reversed! “I now request to Reexamine ye Zao and Feng Xianxian’s test papers in front of everyone. Take out their test papers and let us compare them. I believe that the eyes of the masses are clear.” ”

Feng Xianxian had the information that she gave. It was impossible that she did not even enter the top ten. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Therefore, the biggest possibility was that someone changed Feng Xianxian and ye Zao’s test papers. ”

“If the test papers had really been swapped, it could be seen by comparing the handwriting. ”

“Moreover, the entire test was monitored electronically. ”

“”Sister Caiyi, thank you.”Feng Qianxian looked at Liu Caiyi with red eyes. ”

She also felt that someone had swapped the test papers of her and Ye Zhuo.

It was ye Zhuo who had snatched away the glory that belonged to her.

“Liu Caiyi looked at Feng Qianxian and said with a smile, “Qianxian, don’t worry. I will definitely return you justice.”Liu Caiyi had always been a messenger of justice. She could not stand to see someone impersonating her. ”

She could not stand to see a person who cheated so arrogantly!

The person who got full marks was Feng Xianxian. On what basis was ye Zhuo impersonating her?

This was not fair!

“As soon as these words were said, someone immediately echoed. ”

“I agree with Vice President Liu’s words!”

“I agree too!”

“There must be someone impersonating her!”

Re-examination papers?

“As soon as these words were said, Li Zhentian frowned. ”

“After all, there had never been such a precedent in the literary world. ”

“Moreover, this was also disrespectful to Ye Zhuo! ”

“Li Zhentian looked at Liu Caiyi. “Vice president Liu, our literary world’s examination papers have always been fair and just. There will never be a situation where we swap papers!” ”

“Liu Caiyi continued, “True Gold is not afraid of fire, and true results are not afraid of being questioned! “If no one really tampered with the test papers, chief Li, why don’t you dare to take out their test papers? “I always firmly believe that justice may be late, but it will never be absent!” ”

Liu Caiyi’s words stirred up the emotions of the crowd.

Some people even cheered.

“Re-examine the Test Papers!”

“Imposter is Shameless!”

“Hearing the questioning voices below the stage, Ye Zhuo’s face didn’t change at all. He only took a few steps forward, slightly bent over, and dialed the microphone in front of him. ”

Such a simple action made everyone subconsciously quiet down and look at Ye Zhuo.

“”Imposter is not something that can be said lightly. Since vice-president Liu is questioning my results, then I will accept vice-president Liu’s doubts.”. I believe that those who have just participated in the assessment competition are very clear that the last question on the exam paper is extremely difficult. Since vice-president Liu thinks that Feng Xianxian is the one who got a full score, then can I request for student Feng Xianxian to go on stage and solve this question with me?” ”

“When these words were said, everyone nodded. ”

It had to be said that ye Zhuo’s method was indeed not bad.

“If someone really changed the test paper, then ye Zao would definitely not solve this question. ”

“Of course!”Liu Caiyi nodded and laughed in her heart. This ye Zao really dared to say it.

Solving the question in public?

“Did she really think that after she impersonated him, she would have the real thing? ”

Impossible!

Feng Qianqian immediately stood up from her seat and went to the stage.

“Li Zhentian asked someone to bring two blackboards, and Ye Zhuo and Feng Xianxian solved the questions at the same time. ”

The last set of questions covered all the knowledge and propositions in ancient and modern times.

“Because Feng Xianxian had done it once, she did not find it difficult to do it again. She picked up the marker pen and began to solve the questions, ”

then she looked at Ye Zhuo.

He did not write for a long time.

“Seeing this scene, the disdain in Liu Caiyi’s eyes became even stronger. ”

She knew that Ye Zhuo would definitely die in front of the light!

She simply could not accept the test of an imposter.

The people below the stage also had different expressions.

It was really too shameless!

To actually create an imposter.

“At this moment, Ye Zhuo, who was originally in a daze, suddenly started writing. ”

She wrote very quickly.

“Before the crowd could react, she had left a string of characters on the blackboard. ”

It was a feast for the eyes.

It was so fast that almost no one could understand the words she had written.

“What is she writing?”

“Why can’t I understand it?”

“I can’t understand it either!”

Ding!

The ten-minute countdown ended.

Feng Xianxian finished writing one question at a time.

She then looked at Ye Zhuo and stopped writing at that moment.

“Time’s up.”The chief examiner walked between the two of them. “Now let’s take a look at your answers.”

The Chief Examiner projected their answers onto the big screen with a projector.

On the top of the screen were the standard answers.

Only then did everyone see the two answers clearly.

Feng Xianxian also looked up.

The first thing she looked at was ye Zao’s answers.

Ye Zao’s answers made her a little confused.

“She probably didn’t know how to write, so she just wrote a little. ”

Only her answers were the most perfect.

“DAMN! This is written in three different languages?”

“It’s indeed written in three different languages!”

“This is written by Miss Feng?”

“Miss Feng is too amazing!”

“On the stage, Feng Xianxian had a smug look on her face. ”

Of course she was amazing!

“That’s not right... This seems to be written by Ye Zhuo...”

“DAMN! This is really written by Ye Zhuo!”

“Then what is she writing?”

“”This is a problem-solving process written in three different languages. They are the international common language, Egyptian language, and oracle bone script.” ”

When these words were said.

Everyone was stunned.

“No one expected that not only did ye Zhuo write the answer perfectly, but he also used three different languages to write a different problem-solving process. ”

Ye Zao was truly the first place winner!

“All the doubts, sarcasm, and disdain turned into affirmation and shock at this moment. ”

“The chief examiner’s voice sounded again, “Vice president Liu, Feng Xianxian’s last problem was solved incorrectly, while miss ye used three different words to write out the correct problem-solving process. Now, do you still suspect that Miss Ye is an imposter?” ”

The result was obvious.

“If ye Zhuo had really cheated, would she have mastered the solution of three different characters at the same time? ”

“Hearing this, Feng Qianqian was stunned. ”

She did it wrong.

She actually did it wrong!

How was this possible!

It couldn’t be!

She didn’t do it wrong.

Feng Qianqian quickly looked up at the standard answer.

At this moment.

Her face turned pale.

It was different.

Her answer was really different from the standard answer.

How could it be wrong?

“Liu Caiyi was also stunned, her face slightly pale. ”

Liu Caiyi couldn’t believe her eyes.

“At this moment, Li Zhentian took out the two’s exam papers and showed them on the big screen through the projector. ”

Feng Xianxian scored 60 points.

Ye Zhuo scored 100 points.

Looking at the bright red 60 points on the test papers.

Liu Caiyi frowned slightly.

“So, Feng Xianxian only got the answers right? ”

Did she get the other questions wrong?

“Thinking of this, Liu Caiyi almost couldn’t breathe. ”

She tried her best to get justice for Feng Xianxian.

She didn’t expect the result to be a slap to her face.

She never expected Feng Xianxian to only score 60 points.

“Li Zhentian looked at Liu Caiyi. “President Liu, now that the truth has been revealed, shouldn’t you apologize to Miss Ye?” ”
