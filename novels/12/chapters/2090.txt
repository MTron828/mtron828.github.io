Translator: 549690339

Mrs. Duanmu was determined not to let Duanmu Feng Go to Earth.

“And Duanmu Feng was determined to go to Earth. At such a time, Mrs. Duanmu could only say harsh words. ”

“Duanmu Feng looked at Mrs. Duanmu. “Mom, do you have to do this?” ”

“I’m doing this for your own good.”Mrs. Duanmu looked at Duanmu Feng.

“You’re not doing this for my own good. You’re threatening me!”Duanmu Fengyu said.

“Mrs. Duanmu continued, “I don’t care how you understand what I’m saying. In short, I won’t allow you to go to Earth. Unless you don’t want to acknowledge me as your mother anymore!” ”

“After saying this, Mrs. Duanmu turned around and left. ”

Duanmu Fengyu stood behind her and looked at her mother’s back with a deep frown.

“Mrs. Duanmu was usually a very gentle person, but once she got angry, it was enough to make people shudder. ”

What should she do?

People said that wealth came from danger.

“It was dangerous to go to Earth, but if she didn’t go, it would directly affect her position in the s galaxy. ”

“She couldn’t just watch that woman from Earth enter her home, could she? ”

“She couldn’t let go of her pride and self-respect, and she couldn’t bear to share a man with another woman. ”

Her mother’s thoughts were simply too terrifying.

She could not agree with her worldview.

“If it were not for what Mrs. Duanmu had said, Duanmu Fengyu would not have believed that her father had raised a woman outside. ”

She absolutely could not follow in her mother’s footsteps.

She could not.

“Duanmu Fengyu clenched her fists, her eyes filled with unwillingness. ”

It seemed that she had to think of another way.

“In a moment, Duanmu Fengyu turned around and returned to the study. ”

On the other side.

Manxing country.

Zhao Dan came to the study.

Manxing was practicing calligraphy to calm his heart.

“Although manxing country’s technological civilization was relatively advanced, the essence of their ancestors could not be lost. Calligraphy had always had a high status in the literary world of Manxing country. Students would also be tested on calligraphy during the college entrance examination. ”

“Manxing’s calligraphy was very good, and many scholars and writers were full of praise. ”

“Xing ‘er.”Zhao Dan walked into the house.

“Mom.”Man Xing raised his head to look at Zhao Dan.

“Zhao dan smiled and said, “You’ve worked hard. I’ve brewed some star-moon grass for you, so you can nourish your body.” ”

“”Thank you, Mom.”Man Xing took the bowl from Zhao Dan with both hands. “You’ve worked hard.” ”

“Looking at her sensible daughter, Zhao Dan’s eyes were filled with satisfaction. ”

This was the difference between man Xing and man Wen.

“If it was man Wen, he would definitely say impatiently, “Why are you drinking star Moon Grass? isn’t there a nutrient solution?” ”

“”It’s not hard.”Zhao dan smiled and said, “Oh right, Xing ‘er, you said that you were watching the Duanmu family. How is it going?” ”

“Man Xing took a sip of the nutrient solution and said, “It’s not as simple as we thought.” ”

“The Duanmu family looked simple, but in reality, how was it simple? ”

Duanmu Huang Fei was the wife of the president.

Duanmu Feng was the fiancée of the new president.

“In the President’s country, besides the Cen family, the Duanmu family was the most powerful! ”

“Zhao Dan wanted to ask more questions, but man Xing continued, “Let’s not talk about this, Mom. I haven’t heard you talk about elder sister for a few days. Do We really have to give up on elder sister?” ”

“We didn’t give up on her. She clearly gave up on us first!”Zhao Dan’s eyes were filled with dissatisfaction.

“Back then, she had done something wrong to ye Zhuo. ”

But that was already back then.

So much time had passed. Why did ye Zhuo have to hold on to this matter?

“If it wasn’t for her, would there be Miss Ye who was now famous throughout Chang Yue? ”

“No matter how powerful ye Zhuo was, he still crawled out from her stomach. ”

She was ye Zhuo’s mother!Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“But not only did ye Zhuo not know how to be grateful, he even treated her in such a manner, causing her to lose all face. ”

She deserved to have her position as the female monarch snatched away.

“If ye Zhuo had recognized them earlier, would the position of the female monarch have been snatched away by Ye Han? ”

The reason why ye Zhuo had fallen to such a state today was entirely her retribution!

She had brought this upon herself.

She was not worthy of sympathy at all!

“Man Xing looked at Zhao Dan and continued, “Mom, actually, I’ve asked someone to look into elder sister’s news over the past few days. I’ve also thought of bringing her back…” ”

“Before man Xing could finish his sentence, Zhao Dan said anxiously, “Xing ‘er! You mustn’t do anything stupid!” ”

Bring ye Zao Back?

Why would he bring ye Zao Back?

Embarrass himself?

“Besides, ye Zhuo had not been filial to them for a day. As parents, why should they clean up ye Zhuo’s mess? ”

“”Mother, please hear me out.”Man Xing’s voice was still gentle, “I did look for eldest sister and wanted to bring her back. But strangely, there was no trace of eldest sister in changyue. She seemed to have disappeared overnight.” ”
