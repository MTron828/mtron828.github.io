“Zhang Panti tried her best to calm herself down and said, “Xiao Lan, I have something to do. I Won’t talk to you for now!” ”

“”Okay,”Xiao Lan smiled and said, “We’ll talk again when we have time.” ”

“After hanging up Xiao Lan’s call, Zhang Panti opened the news APP. Sure enough, the news apps were all about the aircraft carrier landing on Neptune. ”

It was real.

It was real!

Ye Zhuo had actually built an aircraft carrier that was faster than the speed of light and had successfully landed on Neptune.

“At this moment, Zhang Pandi could hardly believe her eyes. ”

“After a moment, Zhang Pandi finally reacted. She opened her contact list and called Yu Zifei. ”

“She had been dating Yu Zifei for so many years. Before they broke up, they had imagined the future together. They had even given each other the names of their future children. As long as she admitted her mistake, Yu Zifei would definitely forgive her! ”

Definitely!

Zhang Pandi pressed the dial button.

Di —

The call went through.

“It wasn’t blocked, it wasn’t blocked. ”

“When she heard the call, Zhang Pandi was ecstatic. She knew that Yu Zifei had her in his heart! ”

“After more than ten seconds, the call was picked up. ”

“Hello –”

Zhang Pandi’s smile stiffened at the corner of her mouth.

Because it was actually a woman’s voice from the other end of the call.

Why was it a woman?

Who Was this woman?

“She had only left Yu Zifei for ten days, and there was already a woman who wanted to take over? ”

She was too shameless.

“Seeing that Yu Zifei was different from before, these shameless women all wanted to throw themselves at him! ”

“Zhang Pandi continued, “I am Yu Zifei’s boyfriend. May I ask where is Yu Zifei?” ”

“”You’re brother Yu’s girlfriend?”? Oh, I know. You’re Zhang Pandi, right? But didn’t brother Yu say that he broke up with you a long time ago?”The female voice continued, “Since we’ve already broken up, we won’t call each other girlfriends. Miss Zhang Pandi, please don’t call brother Yu to humiliate yourself in the future!” ”

“After saying that, the other party directly hung up the phone. ” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Humiliate himself?

Zhang Panti wished she could smash her phone! She was so angry that her fingertips were trembling.

Regret!

Zhang Panti was really regretting it now!

“If she had known this would happen, she definitely wouldn’t have broken up with Yu Zifei! ”

What was happening now?

No Way.

She had to do something to salvage the situation and make Yu Zifei forgive her.

On the other side.

“Yu Yuan returned the phone to Yu Zifei. “Brother Yu, your taste is too bad. Why have you been dating this kind of girl for so many years?” ”

“She had kicked Yu Zifei away during difficult times, but now that Yu Zifei had become famous, she had immediately fallen in love with him. ”

It was a little disgusting!

“Yu Zifei drank a mouthful of water. “I used to be young, inexperienced, and insensible.” ”

“You’ve only broken up with her for a few days!”Yu Yuan said speechlessly.

Yu Zifei smiled and did not say anything.

“In fact, he had always thought that he and Zhang Pandi were true love. No matter what happened, Zhang Pandi would never betray him or abandon him. ”

“Now, it seemed that he had always overestimated himself. ”

He was nothing in Zhang Pandi’s heart.

“Yu Yuan continued, “By the way, brother Yu, are you going to get back together with her in the future?” ”

“Am I crazy or stupid?”Yu Zifei asked.

“Yu Yuan thought for a while and said, “But you have been with her for so many years. What if she comes to beg you?” ”

“Yu Yuan continued, “Brother Yu, do you know that third aunt has even looked after the furniture for the sake of your marriage?” ”

“Yu Zifei had been talking to Zhang Pandi for so many years and had already met both parents. Although Yu Zifei’s mother was not satisfied with Zhang Pandi’s family, she was still very satisfied with her. Zhang Pandi was a good-looking person, she had a high education background and was sensible! Most importantly, Yu Zifei liked her! ”

“Yu Zifei said, “My mother knows that I broke up with her. She has been really busy arranging a blind date for me these past few days!” ”

“Really?”Yu Yuan asked in surprise.

“Yes.”Yu Zifei nodded.

“Yu Yuan smiled and said, “That’s great. I don’t have to worry about you and Zhang Pandi getting back together!” ”

On Zhang Pandi’s end.

“After hanging up the phone, Zhang Pandi finished watching the interview about Yu Zifei. ”

“The more she watched, the more upset Zhang Pandi felt. ”

“At this moment, Zhang Pandi’s phone rang again. ”

It must be Yu Zifei Calling!

Zhang Pandi’s eyes lit up and she immediately picked up the phone. “Pandi!”

“The moment she heard the voice on the other end, the expression in Zhang Pandi’s eyes disappeared without a trace. ”

It was not Yu Zifei.

“It was Zhou Rui, the fat pig. ”
