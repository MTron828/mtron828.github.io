“The two-year-old child was wrapped in a thin piece of clothing. She was curled up with a stray dog to keep each other warm. She looked at the bustling streets and the child in her parents’arms. Her eyes were filled with envy, “Little Sweetie, they all have a home. We definitely have a home too. It’s just that mom and dad can’t find us for the time being. I believe that one day, Mom and dad will find us.” ”

“”When that time comes, I’ll take you to treat your illness. Little Rascal, you have to be strong!” ”

“Woof!”

“The dog in her arms barked, seemingly responding to her. ”

“The girl smiled happily. “Little Rascal, you also think that our parents will definitely be able to find me, right?” ”

“Woof!”

“”Then let’s wait for our parents to come and fetch us back together, Alright?” ”

“On the other end of the screen, Zhao Dan cried her heart out again. Just when everyone thought that she was going to bring the child back, she actually directly destroyed the monitor that was originally bound to the child. ” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Zhao Dan said with a heart-wrenching voice, “Don’t Blame Mom. If you want to blame someone, you can only blame your own bad luck. Mom didn’t want this either. Don’t worry, I will take good care of your sister in the future...” ”

“She couldn’t watch her young daughter suffer in the state of changyue, but she couldn’t do anything. ”

“Zhao Dan hardened her heart and directly cut off the surveillance camera on Little Full Moon, as well as her connection to the full moon. ”

She also cut off all of the little girl’s fantasies.

“The little girl carried the puppy just like that and survived the snowstorm. She also survived the spring, summer, autumn, and winter, but she couldn’t wait for her family to come and pick her up. ”

She waited and waited.

“The four seasons alternated, and the sun and moon rotated. ”

“One day, the puppy’s illness suddenly worsened, and his soul returned to his hometown. The Little Girl’s last hope was gone. ”

“She knelt in front of the puppy’s corpse and cried uncontrollably. “I’m sorry, Little Girl. Daddy and Mommy didn’t come to pick me up...” ”

“Seeing this, the people in front of the screen burst into tears. ”

“How can there be parents like you in the world!”

“You don’t deserve to be parents at all!”

The audience couldn’t help but feel angry in their hearts. They stood up and blamed Zhao Dan and the whole country.

“If it weren’t for the security personnel maintaining order, the angry people would have lost control long ago. ”

“”Fake! This video is fake!”Zhao Dan turned to look at Ye Zhuo, he said painfully, “Miss Ye! Even if we mistook her for a child, you wouldn’t have wronged me like this, right? ! “I’m Yue’er’s biological mother, and Yue’er is the child I carried for ten months. Ever since she disappeared, there hasn’t been a day that I didn’t want to find her! “What do you mean by being like this now? ! “Losing my daughter has already made me very sad. Miss Ye, do you really have to rub salt into people’s wounds?” ”

“It had been so many years since the incident, and the video from that year had long been destroyed. ”

As for why the video appeared now...

It must have been made by Ye Zao in the later stages!

She had to remain calm now and not let anyone notice anything.

“”Miss Ye,”man Xing stood up, looked at ye Zao, and said gently, “I can make ten of these videos in one go. May I ask, what does it represent?” ”

“Ye Zao looked at man Xing and continued, “The video was indeed made by me in the later stages, but I restored it one-to-one according to the truth of that year.” ”

“Hearing that ye Zao did not deny that the video was fake, man Xing heaved a sigh of relief and continued, “May I ask if Miss Ye was at the scene back then? Does Miss Ye have any evidence to prove that this video was restored one-to-one?” ”

At the scene?

How could ye Zao be at the scene!

How Old was ye Zao back then?

“As long as ye Zao did not have any evidence, man Jiangshan and Zhao Dan could counter-sue ye Zao for a false accusation. ”

“Once these words were said, everyone quieted down again. They all looked at ye Zao, wanting to hear her explanation. ”

“”I am the evidence.”At this moment, a white-haired old man walked in from outside the door. ”

“”My Name Is Li Man. I am the nanny who personally sent the full moon princess to the Eternal Glacier. I can prove that Miss Ye’s videos are all true.”Li Man walked to ye Zao’s side and stopped, bowing to ye Zao, “Miss Ye, please apologize to the full moon princess on my behalf. I have let her down! I am willing to accept any punishment!” ”
