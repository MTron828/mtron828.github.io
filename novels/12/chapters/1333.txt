“At this point, Zhou Xiang covered her mouth and exclaimed, “Don’t tell me searing is pregnant!” ”

It was not unusual for a young man to be pregnant.

“Old Mrs. Cen jumped up from the sofa. “Ah! I’m going to be a great-grandmother!”Ever since Cen Shaoqing was twenty years old, she had been looking forward to being a grandmother for more than ten years. ”

“Unexpectedly, she finally saw hope today. ”

“Doesn’t that mean I’m going to be a grandmother?”Zhou Xiang was also very excited.

“Old Mrs. Cen nodded busily. “That’s right, that’s right! Both of us are going to Level Up!” ”

“After saying that.., old Mrs. Cen continued, “No Wonder Shaoqing has been leaving early and returning late these days. Sometimes, he doesn’t even go home for a few days. Occasionally, he comes back, and he’s very tired. At first, I didn’t know what was going on, but it turns out that he’s tired from working hard day and Night!” ”

How could he not be tired from working hard?

“Thinking of this, old Mrs. Cen seemed to see her beautiful great-grandson and great-granddaughter waving at her. She didn’t even bother to put on her shoes and quickly ran in the direction of the dessert house. ”

She didn’t look like an octogenarian who was in his eighties to nineties.

“Before Zhou Xiang could react, old Mrs. Cen had already disappeared from her sight. ”

“Cen Shaoqing was standing beside the oven, looking at the time. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen suddenly walked over and said kindly, “Shaoqing, are you making dessert?” ”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “It’s been hard on you during this period of time. This is the bird’s nest that Grandma specially asked the kitchen to make for you. Take good care of it!” ”

“Cen Shaoqing was not used to old Mrs. Cen’s sudden concern. “Grandma, is something the matter?” ”

Old Mrs. Cen still had a kind smile on her face. “It’s nothing serious. I just wanted to show my concern for you.”

“After that, old Mrs. Cen continued, “By the way, have you decided on the name of My Great-grandson?” ”

Great-grandson?

“He could understand every word that old Mrs. Cen said, but why did he not understand it when they were put together? ”

“When he saw that old Mrs. Cen was carrying bird’s nest over without even putting on her shoes, Cen Shaoqing had a complicated expression on his face. ”

“It was said that when an old man reached a certain age, he would become muddle-headed. ”

Could it be...

Old Mrs. Cen’s mind was starting to lose its clarity?

“Cen Shaoqing silently picked up his phone and sent a message to ye Zhuo. [ leader, are there any early symptoms of Alzheimer’s? ] ”

“Cen Shaoqing was tall, so old Mrs. Cen could not see the content on the phone screen. She anxiously patted Cen Shaoqing. “Brat, I’m asking you a question.” ”

“”Please ask,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“”Has my great-grandson’s name been chosen yet?”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Although it’s a little early to name him, good things take time. It’s better to be prepared than not!” ”

“At this moment, ye Zhuo replied. ”

“Cen Shaoqing opened the message and saw the contents. He supported Old Mrs. Cen with his hands. “Grandma, please sit down first. Let me ask you a question. Your question will be discussed later.” ”

Old Mrs. Cen sat down. “You can ask.”

“Cen Shaoqing stretched out three slender fingers. “Grandma, what is This?” ”

“”Six,”old Mrs. Cen said very seriously. ”

Cen Shaoqing’s heart skipped a beat.

He couldn’t even count properly!

“At this moment, Old Mrs. Cen stood up and slapped Cen Shaoqing on the head. “Brat! Do you think your grandma has dementia? She can’t even recognize three and six! I think there must be something wrong with you.” ”

“Seeing Old Mrs. Cen like this, Cen Shaoqing heaved a sigh of relief. It was good that he was fine. “Then what Great-grandson do you want to name?” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen bumped Cen Shaoqing’s arm and said with a mischievous smile, “Brat, stop pretending! I already know!” ”

“What do you know?”

“Old Mrs. Cen lowered her voice and said, “You and Yezi got on the car first and then bought the tickets! I really couldn’t tell. You Brat, you’re so dispirited. You didn’t even tell me such a big happy event!” ”

“Suddenly, Cen Shaoqing couldn’t keep up with old Mrs. Cen’s speed. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Bad Boy, let me tell you. Naming is a big event in life. You have to get well! You Can’t be careless. It’s best to listen to Yezi!” ”

“This time, Cen Shaoqing finally understood what old Mrs. Cen meant. He raised his hand and touched his nose. “Grandma, you misunderstood. I haven’t gotten on the car with Zhuozhu yet.” ”

Get into the car?

“After saying that, Cen Shaoqing felt that this adjective was a little strange. He didn’t know what he had thought of, but his ears were slightly red. ”

Didn’t get into the car?
