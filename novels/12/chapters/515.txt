“His older brother, who was twelve years younger... ”

And they were even blood-related!

Dragon and Phoenix Twins!

“When Lin Ze was three years old, there was a time when old Mrs. Lin brought Lin Ze to the CEN family’s house to play. Because Lin Ze was mischievous, he was covered in mud and pounced on him. He picked Lin ze up with one hand and pressed him into the swimming pool to wash up. ”

“At that time, Lin Ze was crying profusely. ”

“Ever since then, Lin Ze seemed to have never come to the Cen family’s house again. ”

“Thinking of this, Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddha beads with one hand, and his expression was inexplicable. ”

“At that time, Lin Ze was only three years old. ”

“He probably didn’t remember anything, right? ”

“After a moment, CEN Shaoqing continued, “Leader, are you sure... that you’re not his sister?” ”

“If Lin Ze was his younger brother, he could still use the attitude of a brother-in-law to educate Lin ze. ”

If It’s your brother.

Doesn’t that make him the educated one?

“Ye Zhuo put his left foot on his right foot and changed his position. The sunlight shone in through the French window and shone on her eyes and brows. “If I were his sister, he wouldn’t be the one that old Mrs. Lin took away.” ”

Cen Shaoqing:”...”does this count as cause and effect?

“If I’d known Lin Ze was gonna be his brother-in-law,. ”

He must have worshipped Linzer like an ancestor!

“Cen Shaoqing’s eyes were deep, “So, Uncle Lin’s first girlfriend was Auntie, and the child that old Mrs. Lin took away was Lin Ze? Because you came out later than your brother, so old Mrs. Lin didn’t know that Auntie was pregnant with twins?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“”Then... did you do an appraisal?”Cen Shaoqing continued to ask, “Are you sure that Lin Ze is your brother?” ”

“Ye Zhuo narrowed his eyes, and his tone was somewhat lazy. “I look very similar to my brother, so it’s unnecessary to do an appraisal.” ”

“So, this was a stone hammer? ”

Cen Shaoqing simply stopped struggling and opened his thin lips. “Auntie is already prepared to accept Uncle Lin Now?”

“”Yes.”Ye Zhuo continued, “They plan to hold the family recognition banquet in three days.” ”

Family recognition banquet.

Cen Shaoqing seemed to have thought of something. His eyes changed slightly and he suddenly had the urge to chop off his hands.

He was a person who did not like to join in the fun.

“Therefore, when he received the Special Assistant’s invitation to the Lin family, his first reaction was to reject it. ”

He did not connect Lin Jincheng and ye Zhuo at all.

He also never expected ye Zhuo to be Lin Jin Cheng’s daughter.

“Thinking of this, Cen Shaoqing quickly took out his phone and sent a message to the special assistant. ”

“When the special assistant received Cen Shaoqing’s message, he was also a little stunned. ”

Didn’t master five never attend banquets?

“Moreover, he had already rejected it just now. ”

Why did he go back on his word now?

“After contacting the special assistant, CEN Shaoqing heaved a sigh of relief. ”

Ye Zhuo leaned against the back of his chair and looked sideways at Cen Shaoqing. “I’m a little thirsty.” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“What would you like to drink?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“Um...”ye Zhuo thought for a moment. “An Iced Coke.”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing stood up and went to get a Coke for ye Zhuo.

Cen Shaoqing’s office had a refrigerator filled with coke and all kinds of desserts.

“”Leader, do you want to eat an Ophra?” ”

“Yes.”

Cen Shaoqing took a bottle of coke and then another piece of Opella.

“I want to eat two pieces.”Ye Zao’s voice sounded again.

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing took another piece of Opella.

“Just as Cen Shaoqing walked to ye Zao’s side with the dessert and Coke, there was a knock on the door. ”

“Come in.”

“The secretary pushed the door open and walked straight to the desk. “Master Five, there is a document here for you to sign.” ”

“When she raised her head, the secretary was stunned. ”

She saw that the person sitting at the desk was not Cen Shaoqing at all.

“The girl was sitting on a chair, her feet resting on the desk in front of her. She looked like a boss, and behind her stood an assistant who served tea and water. ”

“If he was not mistaken, that assistant was them... ? ... Fifth Master? ”

The Secretary felt that her eyes were blind.

“Otherwise, how could he have hallucinated? ”

“Everyone knew that master five Cen was a territorial person with a strong sense of territory. Usually, no one could take a hit from his things. ”

“Is there anything else?”

A low voice suddenly appeared in the air.

It was not until master five CEN spoke that the secretary was sure that he was not mistaken.

This was really their master five!

“Master five CEN, who was usually serious and aloof, made people’s expressions change when they talked about him. ”

“The secretary turned to look at Ye Zhuo again. Other than shock, there was also admiration in her eyes. ”

Cen Wu Ye was sitting in his boss’s chair.

Her feet were on Cen Wu Ye’s desk.

“She even asked Cen Wu ye to bring her tea and water. However, Cen Wu ye was willing to do it without any complaints. ”

Their fifth master’s wife was really amazing!
