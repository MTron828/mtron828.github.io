Translator: 549690339

“Bai Shu looked at ye Zao, her eyes filled with amazement.”

She finally understood why Old Lady Cen was full of praise for ye Zao!

“This little girl had to have a good appearance, figure, and figure, just like the one in the painting. Anyone who looked at her could not help but want to get close to her.”

“”Hello, aunt,”ye Zao greeted politely.”

“Bai Shu nodded repeatedly and said with a smile, “Good, good, good! This child is really handsome!””

“”Handsome, right?”Old Lady Cen was extremely satisfied when she saw Bai Shu like this. “How can my granddaughter-in-law not be handsome?””

She knew that Bai Shu would definitely be amazed by ye Zhuo when she saw him!

As expected!

“Bai Shu held ye Zhuo’s hand. “Child, How Old Are You this year?””

“”Twenty,”ye Zao answered.”

“Is your home also in the capital?”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“”Okay, it’s better to be closer.”Bai Shu liked ye Zao very much and continued, “Aunt’s home is in Lincheng. This year’s New Year, you must go and visit aunt with Shaoqing!””

Bai Shu could not wait to introduce ye Zao to her relatives at home!

“”Okay, Auntie. I will definitely go with Cen Shaoqing to visit you during the New Year.””

Bai Shu held ye Zao’s hand. “Then it’s settled. You must not lie to Auntie!”

“”Yes, don’t worry.”Ye Zao nodded.”

“”Auntie, Zao Zao also prepared a small gift for you.”Cen Shaoqing walked forward at the right time.”

“”Oh Really?”Bai Shu smiled and said, “This child, just come! Why did he bring a gift!””

“Cen Shaoqing took out the gift and said, “Aunt, this is a high-tech pillow that Zao Zao developed himself. It can help you sleep. Didn’t you always say that you can’t Sleep Well? If you use this, you will definitely sleep until dawn!””

“Bai Shu took the pillow and said happily, “Okay, then I will definitely try it tonight!””

“”And this, this is a set of sister clothes that Zao Zao bought for you and Grandma.”Cen Shaoqing took out another set of clothes.”

“Old Mrs. Cen said in surprise, “Am I part of it?””

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing handed the clothes to the two old ladies.

“Old Mrs. Cen took the clothes. She liked them very much. She looked at Bai Shu and said, “Shall we go and try them on?””

“Sure!”Bai Shu nodded and followed Old Mrs. Cen’s footsteps.

The two old ladies walked to the changing room to change their clothes.

“After about ten minutes, the two of them walked out of the changing room.”

“They wore a wine-red coat. The style was simple and elegant, making the two old ladies look a little younger.”

“The beauty was old. Although the two old ladies were already old, it could still be seen that they were elegant when they were young.”

“Bai Shu said strangely, “I don’t think this coat is thick. There’s no cotton and no down in it. Why is it so warm! It’s even warmer than my down coat!””

Could it be an illusion?

Bai Shu touched the fabric of the shirt. She was starting to doubt her life. She even wondered if she was seeing things!

“Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “You don’t understand this, do you? This is called an air-conditioned shirt that can automatically adjust the temperature. It’s warm in winter and cool in summer!””

“Air-conditioned shirt?”Bai Shu widened her eyes in surprise. “There’s such a shirt?”

“”Yes!”Old Mrs. Cen nodded. “Yezi gave me a few of them! If you don’t believe me, you can go outside and walk around a bit to see if it’s not cold at all!””

Bai Shu really didn’t believe it.

“After living for so long, she had never seen any air-conditioning clothes. The air-conditioning even relied on electricity for heating and cooling!”

There was nothing on these clothes. What was the basis for the warmth in winter and the coolness in summer?

Bai Shu stood up and walked out of the main door.

“It had snowed last night, and it was a vast expanse of whiteness outside. At this time, the cold wind whistled, and the temperature had already dropped TO-19 degrees Celsius. It was so cold that people were shivering.”

“However, after Bai Shu walked out, she did not feel cold at all. Not only was she not cold, she felt a bit of heat instead.”

“This winter, other than staying in the house, she had never felt any heat outside.”

“Or could it be that she had just come out of the house, and the temperature on her body had not yet dissipated?”

“Bai Shu tried to take off the wine-red coat on her body. Just as she took it off, she shivered from the cold.”

“Bai Shu hurriedly put on her coat. After putting it on, she was instantly enveloped by a warm feeling, as if there was some kind of heat that was constantly being transferred from her clothes.”

It was very warm.

“This time, Bai Shu immediately believed it. She ran back and said excitedly, “Sister Tang! Sister Tang, it’s really warm!””

“Old Lady Cen smiled and said, “Of course! Can I Lie to You?””
