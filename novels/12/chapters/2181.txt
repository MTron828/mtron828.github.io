Translator: 549690339

“All these years, Li Man, who never believed in ghosts and gods, began to believe in Buddhism and vegetarianism. But even so, the guilt in her heart did not diminish in the slightest. ”

Until three days ago.

“When Man Wen found her, she knew that the day of her liberation had come. ”

“She had hidden for so many years and felt guilty for so many years. Finally, the clouds had cleared and the Sun had come out. She did not have to suffer and spend every day in pain. ”

“Man Jiangshan and his wife were the biological parents of the full moon. She, an outsider, had suffered for so many years. Did the man Jiangshan and his wife not feel anything at all? ”

“Thinking of this, Li Man raised her head and looked at the man Jiangshan and his wife, “Sir, Madam, in so many years, have you not had a nightmare? That is a living life! Aren’t you afraid that the full moon princess will seek revenge on you by sacrificing your life? !” ”

“”Slander!”Man Jiangshan, who had been silent all this time, opened his mouth, “Who the hell are you? ! Why did you team up with Ye Zao to frame us? ! The full moon is my most valued eldest daughter. Ever since she went missing, I have always wanted to find her. How could I deliberately lose her? ! Sir, please investigate this matter thoroughly and give me and my wife an explanation!” ”

“At this moment, although man Jiangshan looked extremely calm, he was actually very anxious in his heart. He was also very regretful now, regretting why he had brought this matter to the interstellar court. ”

“He was the president of the Manxing Nation. No matter how capable he was, he could not reach the interstellar realm! ”

What should he do now?

“At this point, man Jiangshan paused, then, he added, “Full moon, full star, Manwen, they are all my flesh and blood. If I really had the intention to kill my daughter, then how could Manwen and full star live in Peace Now?” ”

“After he said that, the people who were already discussing began to discuss again. ”

“”Yeah, Mr. Man has no reason to hurt his own daughter.” ”

“I think this Li Man is definitely a bad person!”

“”I think Mrs. Man is right. I guess it was ye Zhuo who wanted to pretend to be the full moon princess and killed the full moon princess in the end. Now, he wants to frame Mr. Man and Mrs. Man for this matter. It’s too vicious!”! “How can such a person exist in this world? !” ”

“”Not necessarily. After all, in the video that Miss Ye showed, Mrs. Man is not a good person!” ”

“Silence!”

“At this moment, the judge tapped the small hammer in his hand. ”

The scene instantly became quiet.

“The judge stood there and said, “Mr. Man, don’t worry. The intergalactic court will handle this matter in a fair and open manner. We will not let a bad person go, and we will definitely not frame a good person.” ”

“After saying that, the judge looked at Li man and said, “Li Man, do you have any evidence to prove that you are Li Man, and Everything You Said is the truth?” ”

“Li Man took out a bag and walked to the judge. “This is my work card from 19 years ago. Also, to protect myself, this is the audio evidence I left behind.” ”

Recording!

Li Man had actually recorded the recording at that time.

Zhao Dan could not help but raise his hand to wipe the cold sweat off his forehead.

The judge took the work permit and the recording device.

“A moment later, the voice from the recording device came out. “Li Man! Send her away immediately, as far away as possible!” ”

“”But, but she is your and Madam’s biological daughter.” ”

“...”

“”Shut up! Li Man, you shut up! From now on, there is no full moon princess in Manxing! The One in your arms is a dog! I have already done my best to spare her life!” ”

The voice coming from the recorder was almost exactly the same as the one in the video.

“Although nineteen years had passed, the quality of the sound was still very good. ”

Zhao Dan and Manjiangshan did not expect that Li man would actually carry a recording device that had been kept until now.

“The judge handed the recorder to the staff and said, “Take it and examine it.” ”

“Okay.”The staff member took the recorder with both hands.

“Li man continued, “As for why Sir and Madam wanted to throw away the full moon princess, it was all because of that master Cao! “Master Cao misled the public with his lies. Ever since the birth of the full moon princess, he said that the full moon princess was a Jinx and would bring disaster to the entire family and the entire Manxing Kingdom!” ” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Speaking up to this point, Li Man took out two more photos. “These are the divination images that master Cao gave the full moon princess. I secretly took them.” ”

“At this time Zhao Dan wanted to pounce on the stage, Li Man stabbed to death. ”
