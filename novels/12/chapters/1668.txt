“”I, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. Director Ma, Are You Alright? I didn’t do it on purpose!”That person immediately apologized to director Ma. ”

“Director ma raised his head unhappily and said with a frown, “Xiao Shen, why are you in such a hurry?” ”

“”Yes, it’s Miss Ye...” ”

“Before Xiao Shen could finish his sentence, director Ma hurriedly interrupted him. “What’s wrong with Miss Ye? Don’t be anxious, speak slowly!”Could it be that Cen Jiang had already found ye Zao’s body? ”

This was too fast!

“At the same time, director Ma also heaved a sigh of relief. ”

He was really afraid that ye Zao would turn misfortune into luck!

“Xiao Shen took a deep breath and continued, “Miss Ye brought back the volcanic crystal from Mount Mars. Now, she’s letting master five go over to study it!” ”

What?

Ye Zao brought back the volcanic crystal from Mars?

That means...

Ye Zao is fine?

“Director ma continued, “Miss Ye has already returned?” ”

“That’s right!”Xiao Shen nodded.

“You didn’t see wrongly?”Director Ma followed up with a question.

“”I didn’t see wrongly. Miss ye just spoke to me!”Xiao Shen continued, “Director Ma, I Won’t chat with you anymore! Miss Ye has also instructed me on other matters!” ”

“After saying that, Xiao Shen jogged away. ”

“Looking at Xiao Shen’s back, director Ma’s face was filled with disappointment. “Why are you back again?” ”

Ma Fangfei had clearly said in the communication device that ye Zao had been in trouble.

But now...

Ye Zao had actually returned. How could director Ma accept this?

He simply couldn’t accept it!

“Beside him, professor Yue also had a desolate look on his face. He turned to look at director Ma. “What should we do now?” ”

Director ma frowned tightly. “Let’s go over and take a look first.”

Professor Feng nodded.

“The two of them came to Big C district together, but because ye Zhuo was having a meeting inside, they didn’t see Ye Zhuo. ”

“Seeing director Ma come over, Ma Fangfei ran over with a smile. “Dad! Auntie Feng.” ”

Professor Feng smiled and nodded. “Fangfei.”

“Director Ma’s face was stern. “Fangfei, come with me.” ”

“OH.”Ma Fangfei followed director Ma’s footsteps.

The two of them came to Ma Fangfei’s office.

“Director Ma’s expression was very unsightly. “Fangfei, what’s going on?” ”

“”What do you mean, what’s going on?”Ma Fangfei asked in puzzlement. ”

“Director ma continued, “Didn’t you say that Miss Ye was in danger? Then why did Miss Ye come back safely?” ”

“”Dad, aren’t you happy that Miss Ye came back safely?”Ma Fangfei carefully sized up director Ma’s expression. ”

“Director ma restrained the expression on his face, then he said, “How can I not be happy that Miss Ye came back safely? What I’m angry about is why you didn’t tell me about this in advance! You made me worry for such a long time for nothing!”Director ma almost discussed with Professor Feng about what would happen after landing in Europa. ”

Who would have thought that ye Zhuoyou would come back at this time!

“Ma fangfei smiled and said, “I was too happy! “That’s why I forgot to tell you. I’m really sorry for making you worry for so long! “Dad, do you know? “Miss Ye is really amazing. She actually got the volcanic crystal on Mars. I believe that in the near future, Miss Ye will definitely be able to turn a barren Mars into an oasis!” ”

Director ma wished he could give Ma fangfei a slap.

But he still controlled his emotions.

“”I still have things to do, so I’ll be leaving First!”Director ma turned around and walked out. ”

“Ma Fangfei followed director Ma’s footsteps. “Dad, you called me over just to ask about this?” ”

“”En.”Director ma nodded and said with a change of heart, “Now that I know that Miss Ye is fine, I can be at ease! Alright, you go do your thing. I still have other things to do with Professor Feng!” ”

“”Alright, then I’ll go and do other things!”Ma Fangfei walked to the other side. ”

“Seeing director Ma come out, Professor Feng immediately went up to him and said in a low voice, “How is it? Miss ye has really returned?” ”

“Yes.”Director ma nodded.

Professor Feng Sighed. “I knew it wouldn’t be that easy!”How could a person like ye Zhuo easily get into trouble?

“Director ma continued, “Don’t be discouraged, there will always be other opportunities!”No matter what, he had to land on Europa and prove himself to the world! ”

On the other side.

Country C.

“Dr. Cara sat at the head of the conference table, “Everyone, now that China has taken over our experimental base, we have to crack the secret of the aircraft carrier reaching the speed of light!”If not, wouldn’t all the resources on the eight planets.., become China’s? ”

“Because of the speed of light aircraft carrier, the number one country in the world had changed from country C to China! ”

No one could continue to develop like this.

“When this was said, everyone agreed. ”

“However, how to crack it became a big problem. ”

“If they wanted to crack the secret, they had to know enough about the aircraft carrier. But now, they hadn’t even touched the edge of the aircraft carrier, how could they crack it? ”

“”Dr. Cara, I have an idea.”Jamila raised her hand. ”

“Go ahead.”Dr. Cara looked at Jamila.

“Jamila turned on the computer and clicked the mouse. A transparent barrier immediately appeared in the air, and the information of two people appeared on the barrier. ”

“”These two people are core members of the CEN Base’s greater area C. they participated in the construction of the aircraft carrier. This is Ma Jianbang, and this is Feng Qi. We can bribe them.” ”

“”Bribe?”A voice of opposition immediately appeared in the air, “The Chinese are famous for their loyalty! Moreover, YC just led them to successfully land on the eight planets. Bribing them is easy. Do you think they will be bribed by us?” ” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Jamila laughed softly, then, she said, “Ma Jianbang and Feng Qi have studied Europa for most of their lives. They dreamed of landing on Europa, but YC rejected their plan. “If we use this as a condition, I believe that they will definitely switch sides!” ”

“Other than Tang Xue, Jamila had also arranged other spies in the Cen family’s base, so he knew so clearly. ”

“Professor Cara narrowed his eyes and continued, “Alright, I’ll leave this matter to you. As long as they cooperate with us, landing on Europa will be a piece of cake!” ”

Jamila nodded. “Then I’ll make a trip to China Tomorrow.”

“Okay.”

China.

“Through the volcanic crystals that he brought back, Ye Zao had successfully customized a plan to improve the climate and environment of Mars. ”

“Yu Zifei stood up and said, “Miss Ye, I’m applying to become the person-in-charge of the OASIS Project.” ”

“Ye Zao lowered his eyes slightly and continued, “To complete this project, you’ll need to stay on Mars for a long time and come back once a month. Can you accept that?”Although an aircraft carrier could reach the speed of light, it would require a lot of energy to operate once, currently, the samples that were brought back from other planets were still under research. They were unable to provide an inexhaustible supply of fuel. If the aircraft carrier flew frequently, it would burden earth! ”

“Sure.”Yu Zifei nodded.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “I will give you one night to think about it. You should go back and discuss it with your parents.”It was not a small matter to go to Mars for a long time. Yu Zifei had to discuss it with his parents. ”

“Alright.”Yu Zifei nodded.

The next morning.

“Director Ma went to find Professor Feng. “Professor Feng, let’s go out for lunch together.” ”

“Professor Feng said, “I have other things to deal with at noon. I might not have time to go out.” ”

“Director ma continued, “How long can it take for us to have lunch together? Coincidentally, I have something to discuss with you.” ”

Professor Feng immediately understood.

It was better to have a meal than to discuss something.

“Alright.”Professor Feng nodded.

“At 12 o’clock in the afternoon, Professor Feng arrived at the restaurant that director Ma had arranged for. ”

“When he saw Professor Feng walking over, director Ma immediately stood up. “Professor Feng, over here!” ”

Professor Feng walked over and realized that there was someone sitting at the dining table.

“Director ma smiled and said, “Professor Feng, this is Dr. Jamila. You should have met him before.” ”
