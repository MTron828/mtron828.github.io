“Chapter 768: 171: No. 1! 4, fought over by the big shots”

Translator: 549690339

Two very handsome little brothers.

“Zhao pingting smiled and said, “Zha Zha, you go ahead and do your work! We’ve already agreed that we’ll let these two little brothers take us around the literary world!” ”

“Opposites attract, not to mention that these two little brothers were so handsome. ”

“An Lizi hurriedly nodded. “Yes, yes, yes! Zha Zha, you go ahead. Don’t worry about us!” ”

“”Alright, I’ll go over first.” ”

“”Go on, go on.”An Lizi and Zhao Pingting pushed ye Zhuo over. ”

Ye Zhuo came to master Yu’s side.

Master Yu and the others brought ye Zhuo over to the other side.

“At this moment, the triennial assessment had officially ended. ”

“Feng Qianqian walked to Liu Caiyi’s side. “Sister Caiyi, I’m sorry. I’ve disappointed you.” ”

“Liu Caiyi looked at Feng Qianqian as if she was a stranger. Her usual enthusiasm was gone, and her gaze was cold as if she was looking at a stranger. “There’s nothing between me and Miss Feng, so there’s no need for Miss Feng to apologize to me!” ”

Just one sentence about Miss Feng pulled the distance between her and Feng Qianqian apart.

“Back then, Liu Caiyi approached Feng Qianqian because she felt that Feng Qianqian was a promising talent. She used her connections to get Feng Qianqian into the assessment competition and even leaked the examination questions to Feng Qianqian. ”

Who knew that she still made a mistake!

“After saying this, Liu Caiyi turned around and left. ”

“Looking at Liu Caiyi’s back, Feng Xianxian’s heart turned cold. ”

She knew.

She had lost Liu Caiyi as a guard of honor.

What should she do?

What should she do now?

Ye Zao!

This was all ye Zao’s fault!

“Since ye Zao did not let her have a good time, then ye Zao would not have a good time either. ”

Feng Xianxian narrowed her eyes. The viciousness in her eyes was almost ready to be quenched.

This was the first time ye Zao visited the Sea of Books Conference since he came to the literary world.

Master Yu brought her to meet many leaders of the conference.

“Although they were leaders of the conference, they still had to address ye Zao as Miss Ye. ”

“After all, Ye Zao’s strength was obvious. ”

“Master Yu.”

“At this moment, Li Zhentian’s two assistants walked in from outside. ”

“”Assistant Jiang, assistant Wang, why are you here?”Master Yu looked at the two of them. ”

“Assistant Wang said, “Chief Li has prepared a welcoming banquet for Miss Ye. He asked us to invite Miss Ye to attend.” ”

“”Miss Ye, this way please.”After saying that, assistant Wang made a ‘please’gesture. ”

Ye Zhuo hesitated for a moment.

“Master Yu clasped his hands behind his back and followed ye Zhuo’s footsteps. “Zhuo Zhuo, I’ll go with you.” ”

Go Together?

Assistant Wang and assistant Jiang looked at each other and saw the dilemma in each other’s eyes.

“Chief Li didn’t invite me?”Master Yu asked.

Assistant Wang and assistant Jiang didn’t say anything.

Not saying anything at this moment was the best answer.

Because Li Zhentian indeed didn’t invite Master Yu.

“Master Yu continued, “He definitely didn’t invite me because he has a guilty conscience! Let’s Go! Zao Zao, I’ll go with you! I’ll see who dares to openly snatch my precious disciple in front of me!” ”

Master Yu understood Li Zhentian’s personality too well.

“As the head of the literary world, Li Zhentian had taken in a total of seventy to eighty disciples. ”

Unfortunately.

None of them had any literary attainments.

“Seeing how powerful ye Zhuo was, he definitely wanted to snatch his disciple away from him! ”

“Assistant Wang said with some difficulty, “Master Yu, this... This might not be good, right?” ”

Assistant Jiang nodded as well.

“After all, Li Zhentian had only instructed the two of them to invite ye Zhuo over. ”

“If Master Yu also went along, it would make it difficult for the two of them to explain. ”

“Master Yu looked at assistant Wang and continued, “Don’t worry, I followed myself. I Won’t make things difficult for you.” ”

“Hearing this, assistant Jiang and assistant Wang heaved a sigh of relief. ”

“After a short while, the few of them arrived at the hotel where Li Zhentian had set up the welcoming banquet. ”

“Seeing ye Zhuo come over, Li Zhentian greeted her warmly, “Miss Ye.” ”

“Chief Li.”

“Ahem.”Master Yu coughed lightly at the side.

Only then did Li Zhentian see Master Yu who was following behind.

Why was Master Yu Here?

Li Zhentian looked at the two assistants.

Assistant Jiang and assistant Wang immediately lowered their heads.

“Master Yu smiled and said, “Don’t look at the two of them. I followed them here myself.” ”

Li Zhentian quickly smiled apologetically. “I wasn’t considerate enough. I should have invited you and Miss Ye along.”

“It’s okay. I don’t need to invite them. They aren’t outsiders. I can come over myself.”

“Please come in quickly.”

“At this moment, the sound of footsteps came from behind again. ”

“”Chief Li, Master Yu.” ”

Master Yu turned around and saw that there were quite a number of people.

There were five people in total.
