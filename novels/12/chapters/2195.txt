“Ye Zao continued, “We can go. He won’t be coming today.” ”

Cen Shaoqing had a lot of things to do these days.

“OH.”Guangxing nodded.

“Ye Han walked to ye Zao’s side. “Sister, almost everyone is here. Are We leaving or not?” ”

“Let’s go.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

Rumble.

“At this moment, the sound of an aircraft sounded above their heads. ”

Ye Han raised his head slightly. “It’s the JY team.”

Leo took out his binoculars. “There’s an F system aquamarine country aircraft following behind.”

Aquamarine Country?

“Hearing this, Ye Zao’s eyes flashed. ”

“Could it be Qingcheng?” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“As soon as he said this, the aircraft stopped in the square. ”

“The JY team member walked out of the aircraft. “Miss Ye, Mr. Xiao Ye, clan leader Lei, Mr. Feng...” ”

The members of the team greeted them in an orderly manner.

“At this moment, a young and beautiful girl ran out from the aircraft behind them. “Sear Sear!” ”

The girl was about 1.65 meters tall. She wore a black uniform and a pair of leather boots. Her hair was meticulously tied up behind her head. She looked very capable and valiant.

Ye Zao’s pupils slowly dilated when he saw who it was. He could not believe his eyes.

“Qingcheng!”

“Zao Zao.”

The girl quickly ran over and hugged ye Zao.

“”Qingcheng, it’s really you!”Ye Zao was still unable to react. ”

“It’s me.”Shi Qingcheng was the same as her. Her eyes were slightly red.

Shi Qingcheng was a playmate who roamed with ye Zao when they were young.

“However, unlike ye Zao, Shi Qingcheng had accidentally gotten lost. ”

And Ye Zao had been deliberately abandoned.

“After wandering with ye Zao for half a year, Shi Qingcheng was found by her family. When they were separated, the two children cried their eyes out. At that time, the Shi family’s parents even suggested taking ye Zao as their goddaughter and bringing her back to the Indigo Kingdom together. ”

“However, ye Zao rejected them. ”

“At that time, ye Zao really thought that her family would come looking for her. ”

What if she left and her family could not find her?

“Not long after Shi Qingcheng was brought back, her family sent her to a closed military academy to study. It had been many years since they last saw each other. ”

Ye Zao also did not expect to see Shi Qingcheng at this time.

“Shi Qingcheng smiled and said, “I heard from ye Xiaohan that you needed someone to support you, so I rushed over! Zao Zao, after so many years, I feel that my name is becoming more and more suitable for you!” ”

“When she was young, she was very surprised by ye Zao’s looks. Everyone said that a beautiful child would definitely become ugly when they grew up. She did not expect that ye Zao would become more and more beautiful. ”

“When she thought of how she and Ye Zao had warmed up and comforted each other when they were young, Shi Qingcheng’s eyes were filled with warmth. ”

“During that dark period of time, she and ye Zao comforted each other to get through it. ”

“”No, you’re too modest.”Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “If I’m number one in the universe, you’re number two in the universe.” ”

“”Then when we merge, we’ll be invincible in the Universe?”Shi Qingcheng said. ”

“”Yeah, that’s right.”Although the two of them had not seen each other for a long time, so long that they had almost forgotten each other, when they met again, they could still be like before, talking about everything, not at all unfamiliar. ”

“Shi Qingcheng Hugged ye Zao again. “Zao Zao, I’m really happy to be able to meet you again.” ”

“”Me too,”ye Zao said. ”

“After the small talk, Ye Zao introduced Shi Qingcheng to everyone. ”

“When they learned that Shi Qingcheng was actually the successor of the Indigo Kingdom, everyone sighed with emotion. The person who appeared beside ye Zao, even if she was just a little girl, was very outstanding. ”

Take Shi Qingcheng for example.

The outstanding here did not refer to Shi Qingcheng’s identity.

It referred to Shi Qingcheng’s own outstanding qualities.

Shi Qingcheng attended a military academy that only men could withstand.

There were even many grown men who dropped out of school halfway because they could not accept the Devil’s training.

“However, Shi Qingcheng persisted for over ten years and even became a senior instructor. ”

“In a military academy that only had men, a petite girl like Shi Qingcheng actually became a senior instructor. One could imagine Shi Qingcheng’s own strength. ”

“Shi Qingcheng continued, “Oh right, where’s Ye Xiaohan? Why haven’t I seen him?” ”

“”He was just here. He must have gone for something.”Speaking up to this point, ye Zhuo seemed to have suddenly thought of something and turned to look at Shi Qingcheng. “Qingcheng, you know ye Han Too?” ”

“Yes.”Shi Qingcheng nodded. “We know each other from the military academy. Didn’t Ye Xiaohan tell you?”

“Speaking of ye Qiao, when she was in the Military Academy, she was still in the same class as ye Han. ”
