Translator: 549690339

“Now?”Cen Shaoqing twirled the prayer beads.

“Yes.”

“Cen Shaoqing put away the prayer beads. “Alright, I’ll go now.” ”

“Ever since the wedding date was set, Cen Shaoqing felt that the way Lin Jincheng and Lin Ze looked at him had changed. ”

“Especially in Lin Jincheng, who guarded against Cen Shaoqing like he was guarding against thieves. ”

Cen Shaoqing drove to the Lin family manor.

“When he arrived, he was just in time for dinner. ”

“”Uncle, Auntie.” ”

“Seeing Cen Shaoqing, Ye Zhuo was a little surprised. “Why are you here?” ”

“”I came to discuss something with you,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“Ye Shu immediately stood up from the sofa and smiled. “Shaoqing is here. Sit Down, sit down! You must have not eaten yet! Nanny Liu, add some bowls and chopsticks!” ”

“”Yes, Madam.” ”

Ye Shu was too enthusiastic. She was so enthusiastic that Cen Shaoqing did not have the chance to refuse.

“Therefore, Cen Shaoqing, who had already eaten dinner, forcefully ate two bowls of rice. ”

Nothing else.

He just wanted to leave a good impression on his father-in-law and mother-in-law.

It took a lot of strength to eat.

A grown man could have nothing but strength.

“Ye Shu kept using her chopsticks to pick up food for Cen Shaoqing. “Shaoqing, eat more. Recently, there’s a new chef at home. What do you think of his skills?” ”

“”Very good,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “Right! Searing likes the boiled fish cooked by this chef the most! Try this sweet and sour pork tenderloin. It’s said to be a family heirloom. You Won’t be able to eat it outside!” ”

Lin Jincheng sighed helplessly.

“The cabbage in the house was almost taken away by the pig, yet the mistress was still so good to the pig! ”

“The mother-in-law looked at her son-in-law. The more she looked at him, the more she liked him. What kind of metaphysics was this! ! ”

“Bai Jingshu also ate quite a lot tonight. She smiled and said, “Mom, this blood curd is really delicious tonight!” ”

“Ye Shu said, “Then let the kitchen continue cooking tomorrow.” ”

“Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded.

“After eating, Cen Shaoqing and ye Zao went out for a walk. ”

A bright moon shone high in the sky. Everything in the world was plated with a layer of bright moonlight.

“The Moonlight Tonight is really beautiful.”Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddha beads and said in a low voice.

“Ye Zao looked up at the sky and said with a smile, “Yes. The Moonlight Tonight is really beautiful.” ”

“”Leader, do you know the other meaning of the moonlight being really beautiful?”Cen Shaoqing continued to ask. ” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Ye Zhuo laughed lightly. “Take a guess.”

“Seeing her like this, Cen Shaoqing knew that she definitely knew the other meaning of the moonlight being really beautiful. ”

“Cen Shaoqing held the Buddha beads in his left hand and held her hand tightly with his right hand. He then said, “Oh right, Grandma asked me to ask you, what kind of wedding do you like, Chinese or Western style?” ”

“”Chinese style,”ye Zhuo answered. ”

“Phoenix Coronet Bridal Veil?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

Ye Zhuo liked traditional Chinese wedding very much.

“In fact, this was also considered a kind of cultural inheritance. In the future, young people would increasingly like western style wedding. Gradually, some of the things left behind by the ancestors would be forgotten. ”

“Cen Shaoqing slightly arched his eyebrows and continued, “What a coincidence. Grandma also likes Chinese style wedding. If she knew that you also like it, she would definitely be very happy.” ”

“”What About You? What do you like, Chinese or Western?”Ye Zhuo asked. ”

“Cen Shaoqing smiled and said, “I like what you like.” ”

“After saying that, CEN Shaoqing continued, “I really hope that day will come soon.” ”

He was now living like a year.

“Even in his dreams, he was busy getting married. ”

“Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly. “Anyway, you have been single for more than 30 years. It’s not a big deal to wait for a little longer.” ”

“”Baby, do you know what it means to live as long as a year?”Cen Shaoqing suddenly lowered his voice. Although he had deliberately lowered his voice, it was not difficult to tell that there was a faint huskiness in his voice. ”

“There were some things that one did not know when they did not have a girlfriend. Once they had a girlfriend, they would be able to learn without a teacher. ”

“For example, CEN Shaoqing now. ”

Ye Zao laughed softly. “I don’t know.”

“Don’t worry.”Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips curved slightly. “I’ll let you know.”

“The Moonlight Tonight was very beautiful, and the hearts of the people were slowly intoxicated. ”

“Under the illumination of the moonlight, her lips were exceptionally seductive. Cen Shaoqing lowered his eyes slightly, his left hand pressed on the back of her head, and just like that, he leaned over and kissed her. ”

“However, before a kiss could form, a cough sounded in the romantic space. ”

“”Cough, cough, cough!” ”

Cen Shaoqing immediately let go of Ye Zao. He turned his head and saw Lin Jincheng with a serious expression.

“Uncle.”

“Lin Jincheng put his hands behind his back and said expressionlessly, “It’s getting late. Shaoqing, you should go back now!” ”
