Translator: 549690339

Zhou Ziyue was stunned by the scene in front of her. She could not breathe.

Didn’t they say that ye Zhuo’s fiancé was an old and ugly man?

“Why was the man in front of her not old or ugly? Instead, he looked like a visitor from outer space. ”

This face could only be described as Shengshi’s beauty.

What was going on?

Ye Zao was just an idiot who had nothing but skin. How could she have such an outstanding fiancé?

“Zhou Ziyue clenched her hands tightly, feeling extremely uncomfortable. ”

“At this moment, ye Shu opened her mouth, “Shaoqing, this is second aunt. Zao Zao, you’ve met her before.” ”

“”Second aunt?”CEN Shaoqing frowned without a trace and continued, “Auntie, if I remember correctly, Grandma only has you as her daughter. Where did Zao Zao and I get a second aunt?” ”

“After he finished, the atmosphere became a little quiet. ”

“Ye Shu and ye Sui were not related by blood, so it was true. ”

“When Ye Shu and ye Zao were still living in the basement of Yun Jing, they did not see any relatives in their parents’house. But now, everyone who had any connection with them came over to recognize them. ”

It really matched that sentence.

“No one asked if they were poor in a busy city, but rich people had distant relatives deep in the mountains. ”

“Cen Shaoqing was an extremely arrogant person to begin with, so he naturally wouldn’t pay attention to such an extremely philistine person. ”

“His upbringing didn’t allow it, and neither did his pride. ”

“Lin Jincheng smiled and tried to smooth things over. “Since everyone is here, let’s eat.” ”

“Ye Shu followed, “Right, right, right, let’s eat.” ”

“Zhou Ziyue couldn’t sit still. Looking at Cen Shaoqing’s reaction, he wasn’t prepared to treat them as relatives at all. ”

Then what were they?

Air!

Zhou Ziyue was a person who wasn’t afraid of power. She wanted to stand up and defend herself.

How could ye Sui Not Be Ye Shu’s sister?

“Blood was thicker than water. Now that Ye Shu had climbed up the social ladder, she didn’t even acknowledge them as relatives? ”

“But for some reason, as long as she took a look at Cen Shaoqing, she couldn’t help but feel a chill in her heart. Her legs went weak and she couldn’t say a word. ”

“Ye Sui also had an evil fire hidden in her heart. Just like Zhou Ziyue, she could not say a single word in this situation. ”

“For a moment, there was only the sound of chewing on the dining table. ”

“Ye Shu kept picking up food for ye Zhuo with her chopsticks. “Recently, the base has been working overtime. Eat more.” ”

“Okay.”

“After picking up food for ye Zhuo, ye Shu picked up food for Cen Shaoqing. “Shaoqing, eat more too. It’s not good for young people to eat only vegetables. You need to replenish your protein properly.” ”

“”Thank you, Auntie.” ”

“For a moment, the reflection of ye Sui and Zhou Ziyue made the mother and daughter look like outsiders. ”

Ye Sui was almost angered to death.

“Because from the beginning until dinner was almost over, Cen Shaoqing and Ye Zhuo did not call her second aunt. ”

“Logically speaking, when a new son-in-law met an elder for the first time, he should have prepared a red packet. ”

“But Cen Shaoqing not only did not have a red packet, he did not even have the proper etiquette. ”

This was too much!

What did ye Shu mean by this?

Was she trying to intimidate her?

“Ye Sui was furious, but he did not dare to question her. ”

After the meal.

“Ye Shu looked at ye Zao and said, “Zao Zao, after all, Ye Sui and I are sisters. Back then, you helped me once. Can you not make things difficult for them on account of Mom?” ”

“Ye Zao looked at Ye Shu. “Mom, this is between you and them. As long as they don’t go overboard, I will treat them as air.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Shu nodded.

“With these words, Ye Shu was relieved. ”

“Okay.”

“On the other side, in the guest room. ”

Ye Sui was furious. “Ye Shu is such an ingrate. I misjudged her!”

“Zhou Ziyue’s expression was also a little ugly. “Mom, didn’t you say that ye Zhuo’s fiancé is an old and ugly man?” ”

“Moreover, Ye Zhuo didn’t look as stupid as before. ”

He looked very compatible with Cen Shaoqing.

“For no reason, when Zhou Ziyue saw her, she actually felt a sense of inferiority. ”

“Ye Zao and her fiancé were a couple, but she had to spend the rest of her life with an ugly freak. ”

How could Zhou Ziyue be reconciled to this.

“Ye Sui said, “Who knows! Logically speaking, this handsome and rich man shouldn’t be interested in that idiot! How did they end up together! It’s really strange!” ”

“Most importantly, ye Sui looked at that man as if he was more than just rich. ”

His temperament was not something that an ordinary person could have.

“This made ye Sui feel a little jealous. It was one thing for ye Shu to be lucky, but why was her daughter so lucky! ”

“Zhou Ziyue also felt strange and continued, “Do you think that man has some problems in other aspects?” ”

“What problems?”Ye Sui asked.

“Zhou ziyue said, “For example, those problems that can’t be seen?” ”

Those problems that can’t be seen!

“Ye Sui narrowed his eyes and smiled, “Maybe there really are!” ”

“Thinking about it, Zhou Ziyue felt much better. “That man might be a psycho! The kind that is indirect!” ”

“”Right, right, right!”At this point, the smile on ye Sui’s face stopped, and he continued, “But a psycho doesn’t have that kind of Aura, right?” ”

“Even now, when he recalled it, ye Sui still felt a chill in his heart, and he couldn’t help but shudder. ”

“”Indirectly, as long as it doesn’t happen, it’s the same as ordinary people!”Zhou Ziyue said. ”

“You’re right.”Ye Sui nodded.

“Then, ye Sui continued, “I’ll go ask around tomorrow and see what kind of background this man has!”If there really was a mental illness, it would be impossible to hide it. ”

“After all, there was no such thing as an impenetrable wall in this world. ”

“Okay.”

“Ye Sui continued, “You and Xiao Ma still have to continue. You Can’t think that Xiao Ma is not good enough for you just because ye Zao found someone like this! Ye Zao has a good family background, but you don’t have a family background like ye Zao’s!” ”

“This sentence was a good reminder to Zhou Ziyue, who was daydreaming. ”

“After that, ye Sui added, “Not only is your family background inferior to ye Zao’s, you’re not as pretty as ye Zao.” ”

Ye Sui could see it clearly.

Zhou Ziyue couldn’t be compared to ye Zao just by looking at his face.

“At this moment, Zhou Ziyue seemed to have thought of something, she continued, “Oh right, Mom. Why would ye Zao’s fiancé say that Grandma only has one daughter? What’s going on? Could it be that after she became rich, she didn’t even want her biological parents anymore?” ”

This was too much!

“Speaking of this, ye Sui narrowed his eyes. “Could it be… could it be that she knows about it?” ”

“I don’t think so!”

“Ye Sui was also very confused. Logically speaking, ye Shu should not know about it. ”

“”What’s the matter?”Zhou Ziyue was also very curious. “Mom, what did Auntie Know?” ”

“Ye Sui continued, “Your Auntie and I are not biological sisters. She was adopted.” ”

“Adopted?”Zhou Ziyue asked in surprise.

“Yes.”Ye Sui nodded.

“When Ye Shu came to the Ye family, Ye Sui was 12 years old. A 12-year-old girl had already remembered many things. ”

“Actually, if this did not happen tonight, ye Sui would have already forgotten. ”

“Zhou Ziyue narrowed her eyes. “Since she was adopted, then she should know how to be grateful. How could she treat her grandparents and you like that! This is too much! Should grandparents be penniless?” ”

“Zhou ziyue continued, “If she didn’t have grandparents back then, she would have died a long time ago! Now, she has found her biological parents and doesn’t even want them anymore! This kind of person is too disgusting!” ”

“”Mom, go and ask her for the Villa Tomorrow!”Zhou Ziyue changed the topic and looked at ye Sui. ”

“Ye Sui said, “Go Tomorrow? Can she give it to us?” ”

“Ye Sui was originally full of confidence in himself, but after these days of interaction, ye Sui had almost figured out the situation. ”Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

It was impossible to get the villa from ye Shu.

“Zhou Ziyue’s lips curled slightly. “This time, not only does she want to give the villa, she also has to give money.” ”

“Seeing Zhou Ziyue like this, ye Sui’s eyes lit up. “Ziyue, have you thought of a good idea? Quickly tell Mom!” ”

“Zhou ziyue continued, “Just do as I say. If ye Shu dares to reject you, just tell her not to regret it.” ”

“Is this really effective?”Ye Sui asked.

“”Just do as I say,”Zhou Ziyue said. ”

Ye Sui narrowed his eyes.

“Zhou ziyue continued, “By the way, Mom, do you still have evidence of ye Shu being adopted back then?” ”

Ye Sui shook his head. “No.”

“”What about Grandpa and Grandma?”Zhou ziyue said, “We’ll move out of the Lin family today and then call Grandpa and Grandma to come over.” ”

“Ye Sui said in puzzlement, “Ye Shu and Your Grandpa and Grandma have even signed the termination letter. What’s the use of coming here now?” ”

“”Just ask them to come over. Oh right, bring the termination letter with you!”Zhou Ziyue said. ”

Ye Sui looked at Zhou Ziyue. “What exactly do you want?”

“Zhou Ziyue didn’t answer ye Sui. She walked to the cabinet and started to pack her clothes, “We’ll move out tonight! Go find ye Shu now and ask her to buy us a villa and give us a nine-figure deposit. Otherwise, this matter will never end!” ”
