The rest was self-evident.

Cen Shaoqing held ye Zhuo’s hand with the Buddha bead in his hand. “Don’t put too much pressure on yourself.”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“”By the way, where are uncle and Auntie?”Cen Shaoqing continued to ask. ”

“They are resting in the lounge.”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Have you had breakfast?” ”

“No.”

“Then let’s eat together.”Ye Zhuo passed Cen Shaoqing the millet congee that he had eaten. “This millet congee tastes pretty good.”

Cen Shaoqing used the spoon that ye Zhuo had used to scoop up a mouthful of congee.

It was sweet.

“Although Cen Shaoqing could already accept sweet food after spending so much time with Ye Zhuo, he was still not used to eating sweet congee. ”

“However, the porridge this morning tasted surprisingly good! ”

“How does it taste?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“Very good.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Then you should eat more. My mom brought a lot of it. There’s still some in the thermos.” ”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing continued to eat the porridge.

After he finished eating the porridge.

“Cen Shaoqing wiped his hands and continued, “I’ll enter the operating theater with you later. I’ll Be Your Assistant.” ”

“Be my assistant?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly.

“”Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded and asked in a low voice, “Are you looking down on me?” ”

“”Alright, let’s give it a try.”Ye Zhuo continued, “We’ll enter the operating theater half an hour earlier later.” ”

“Okay.”

It was soon 9:30 pm.

Ye Zhuo entered the operating theater and began a series of preoperative preparations.

Director Zhang assigned three doctors and seven nurses to ye Zao.

He also assigned an anesthesiologist.

“Including Cen Shaoqing, there were thirteen people in total. ”

“Cen Shaoqing followed behind ye Zao. He was wearing a white coat and a mask. He was fully armed, and only a pair of deep eyes could be seen. ”

“Although his face could not be seen, his aura was still there. He was a perfect match for ye Zao. ”

Everyone looked at the two of them curiously.

Ye Zao brought Cen Shaoqing to familiarize themselves with the operating theater.

The two of them whispered.

“One of the doctors said, “I heard from doctor Li that the patient was not infected by the virus at all...” ”

“Shh!”The companion next to him immediately made a gesture of silence. “Keep your voice down. You’re worried that someone might hear you. I heard that Doctor Li’s year-end bonus was deducted because of this incident!”

“Is that true?”

“”Of course it’s true!”His companion continued, “In short, it’s better not to discuss this matter. After all, Miracle Doctor Ye is Miracle Doctor Ye!” ”

“”I know, I know. I’m just saying it by your side.” ”

“After making all the preparations, the surgery officially began at ten o’clock. ”

“Outside the operating theater, Father Zhao kowtowed to the west in a different manner. “Buddha bless! Buddha bless! You must bless my son’s surgery to be successful and to live a peaceful and happy life for the rest of his life!” ”

“Ye Shu and Lin Jincheng stood by the side, their faces filled with anxiety. ”

“Time passed by minute by minute, and in the blink of an eye, half an hour had passed. ”

“However, there was not a single sound coming from the operating theater. ”

“At this moment, a figure ran over from the elevator. “Dad, Mom! How’s uncle?” ”

“Ah Ze!”

Ye Shu looked up and saw the travel-worn Lin Ze.

Lin Ze rushed to the hospital as soon as he got off the plane.

“He took the plane overnight. At this time, he had not brushed his teeth, washed his face, or eaten. ”

But he did not feel hungry at all. “Where’s uncle?”

“Ye Shu said, “Your uncle is in the operating room right now, and searing is performing surgery on him. Don’t Worry!” ”

“Hearing that Ye Zao was performing surgery on Ye Sen, Lin Ze heaved a sigh of relief. ”

He knew about ye Zhuo’s medical skills.

“As long as he heard ye Zhuo’s name, he would feel inexplicably at ease. ”

“It was also at this moment that Lin ze noticed father Zhao beside him. He said in a low voice, “Mom, who is that? is he a relative from Yunjing?” ”

“”No.”Ye Shu shook her head and said in a low voice, “Come over here. I’ll tell you.” ” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Lin Ze followed ye Shu to the side.

“After hearing the whole story, Lin Ze’s face was full of disbelief. ”

“He turned to look at Father Zhao, who was sitting on the ground. He really couldn’t imagine that ye Sen had a father-son relationship with such a person. ”

“Lin Ze continued, “Does uncle know about this?” ”

Ye Shu shook her head. “I haven’t heard your uncle talk about this. He probably doesn’t know.”

“Although she and Ye Sen were not biological siblings, they were better than ordinary people. If Ye Sen knew about this, he would definitely not hide it from her. ”

“Lin Ze frowned slightly. He looked at Father Zhao who was sitting on the ground and continued, “Then, isn’t it not good for him to be like this?” ”

“Ye Shu continued, “Don’t bother about him.” ”

“Okay.”Lin Ze nodded.

“Father Zhao just sat on the ground, crying and laughing at times. He did not care about the gazes of others. ”

“Three hours later, the door of the operating theater finally opened. ”

Everyone immediately surrounded it.

Father Zhao also stood up from the ground like a carp.

“”Zhuozhuo, how was it? Did the surgery go well?”Ye Shu asked. ”

Ye Zhuozhuo took off his mask and revealed a jade-like face. “The surgery went very smoothly.”

Ye Shu was so happy that she almost cried. “Really? Your Uncle is fine?”

“Really.”Ye Zhuo nodded. “Uncle is fine.”

Ye Shu hugged ye Zhuo in excitement.

“Father Zhao was also very happy. He quickly turned to the west and bowed. “Thank you, Bodhisattva! Thank you, Bodhisattva, for saving my son’s Life!” ”

“After saying that, Father Zhao turned to look at Ye Zhuo. “Of course, the most important thing is to thank Miss Ye! Miss Ye, thank you! You saved our old Zhao family!” ”

“I saved my uncle. It has nothing to do with your Zhao family.”Ye Zao’s eyes were still as sharp as ever.

“Father Zhao smiled and said, “Miss Ye, your uncle is my son. From now on, we are relatives. We are family. You are treating me as an outsider!” ”

Ye Zao was really amazing!

“If she could save ye Sen, then she would definitely be able to cure Zhao Xueyin’s face! ”

Ye Sen was his son.

And Ye Zhuo had to call ye Sen uncle.

“In that case, he could be considered ye Zhuo’s grandfather. ”

Zhao Xueyin was ye Zhuo’s aunt.

Wasn’t it natural for this niece to save her aunt?

One had to know that Zhao Xueyin was ye Sen’s only sister. Ye Sen would definitely not let her die.

“Thinking of this, Father Zhao narrowed his eyes. ”

“Ye Zhuo knitted his brows without leaving a trace. “Your surname is Zhao, my uncle’s surname is Ye. My uncle has nothing to do with you. Please don’t flatter yourself here!” ”

“”Blood ties are inseparable,”father Zhao continued, “Even if you don’t admit it, your uncle is still my biological son!” ”

“Ye Zhuo ignored father Zhao and turned to look at Lin Jincheng. “Dad, now that uncle is fine, have you contacted the police station?” ”

“”Yes,”Lin Jincheng continued, “Officer Yin said that they will come this afternoon.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Hearing this, Father Zhao had a bad feeling. ”

Would the police find out about the deal between him and Mike?

“If they found out that he was the one who paid for the murder, would ye Sen still forgive him? ”

“Mike was an international assassin, so he should not leave any traces. ”

“However, Father Zhao was still worried. He took the opportunity to call Mike while he was in the bathroom to voice his concerns. ”

“Mike smiled and said, “Mr. Zhao, don’t worry! I have already destroyed the surveillance cameras that should be destroyed. Even if the police turn the scene upside down, they won’t find anything!” ”

“After being an assassin for so many years, Mike was not only good at shooting, but his hacking skills were also superb. ”

“Not to mention China, even country C would not be able to find an opponent that could match him. ”

Want to repair the surveillance cameras?

Difficult!

“Father Zhao nodded. “That’s good. In any case, you have to be careful during this period of time.” ”

It was a small matter if Mike was caught.

It would be more important if he was exposed.

It was not easy for him to finally become his biological son. He did not want to become enemies with his son.

“Moreover, he wanted to use ye Zhuo to heal Zhao Xueyin’s face! ”
