Cen Jiang took the document and frowned slightly.

“”Team leader Cen, do you think we should report this to Miss Ye?”Professor Feng continued, “It is not a small problem to detect organic matter in the Martian soil. This concerns the safety of team leader Yu and the others on Mars.””

“Cen Jiang continued, “We have examined the soil brought back from Mars more than ten times in batches, but we have not detected any organic matter. What is going on?””

What did organic matter represent? ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

It represented life!

This also meant that there was life on Mars.

“Once the organic matter on Mars mutated under the influence of Yu Zifei and the others, the consequences would be unimaginable!”

“Before the aircraft carrier landed on Mars, humans knew nothing about Mars.”

“No one knew what kind of species the organic matter detected from the Martian soil was, and whether it would bring a catastrophe to humans.”

Just like the dinosaurs tens of thousands of years ago.

“Before humans, dinosaurs were the strongest overlords on land!”

“But in the end, they were all wiped out!”

“Professor Feng continued, “Leader Cen, don’t be anxious! It could also be that the Martian soil had changed after they brought it back to Earth. After all, earth was rich in resources! What I meant was to first compare it with the analysis report of the volcanic crystal before deciding whether to inform Miss Ye.””

“At this point, professor Feng narrowed his eyes, and a glimmer flashed across his eyes.”

“Cen Jiang held the document. “Miss Ye is not here now, and I don’t have the authority to get the volcanic crystal analysis report.””

What did Cen Jiang Mean?

Could it be that the volcanic crystal analysis report was not with him?

“If the analysis report was not with Cen Jiang, then where was it?”

“Professor Feng continued, “Then when will miss ye be back? This matter should be done sooner rather than later! I’m worried that if the detected organic matter is really brought back from Mars, it will affect team leader Yu and the others.””

“”Miss Ye will probably come back tomorrow or the day after,”Cen Jiang continued, “I’d better report this matter to miss ye first.””

“”That’s fine too.”Professor Feng nodded. “Team leader Cen, I’ll go back first.””

“Okay.”

“After professor Feng left, Cen Jiang immediately called Ye Zhuo and reported the situation to Ye Zhuo.”

“Hearing this, Ye Zhuo frowned slightly and continued, “Send me the test report.””

“According to Ye Zao’s knowledge, Mars was the same as Earth in ancient times. Indeed, a long time ago, an unknown species had ruled Mars. However, an accident had led to the extinction of all the species on Mars, just like the dinosaurs back then.”

“After the extinction of the dinosaurs, there were still humans who had successfully evolved.”

“However, Mars had always maintained the appearance of the period of extinction.”

“After hanging up the phone, Cen Jiang sent the test report to Ye Zhuo.”

“Ye Zhuo looked at the test report, raised his eyebrows slightly, and spoke to Cen Jiang through voice. “Who sent this test report to you?””

“”It’s Professor Feng,”Cen Jiang said.”

“”Apart from showing you this, did she say anything else?””

“Cen Jiang continued, “Professor Feng asked me to show her the analysis report of the volcanic crystal.””

“Did you?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“No.”Cen Jiang also knew that the analysis report of the volcanic crystal was no small matter. “I said that I don’t have the authority to look at the analysis report of the volcanic crystal.”

“”Yes.”Ye Zhuo pondered for a moment and then said, “Send the analysis report of the volcanic crystal to her later.””

“What?”Cen Jiang thought that he was hearing things.

Ye Zhuo repeated it again.

“After making sure that he didn’t mishear, Cen Jiang continued, “Okay, Miss Ye, I understand.””

“Half an hour later, Cen Jiang brought the analysis report of the volcanic crystal to Professor Feng’s office.”

“”Team leader Cen, have you contacted Miss Ye?”Professor Feng put down his pen and asked.”

Cen Jiang nodded. “Yes. Miss ye asked me to bring the analysis report of the volcanic crystal to you to study.”

“Hearing this, professor Feng’s eyes lit up.”

“A second ago, she was still worrying about the volcanic crystal, but unexpectedly, Cen Jiang had sent the volcanic crystal analysis report over in the next second!”

“After saying this, Cen Jiang handed the volcanic crystal analysis report over to Professor Feng, then, he said, “Professor Feng, Miss Ye said that the volcanic crystal analysis report is top-secret information and is the core document of our entire base. The success of the OASIS project all depends on this analysis report and must not be leaked out! “After you’ve finished your research, send it back immediately!”! “...””

“”Alright. Don’t worry, team leader Cen. I know,”professor Feng said.”

Cen Jiang nodded. “Then I’ll go back first.”
