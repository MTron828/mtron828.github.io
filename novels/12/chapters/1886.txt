“”Second clan leader, the minority will obey the majority. We have all agreed to give the information of the inter-star case to Qiu Di. You Shouldn’t...” ”

“Before the fifth clan leader could finish his sentence, he was interrupted by the second clan leader. “How about this, we don’t have to tell her the password for now. We’ll talk about it on the day of the general election.” ”

“The first clan leader weighed the pros and cons. After a moment, he nodded and said, “Alright, we’ll do as second brother says.” ”

Qiu clan.

“Ever since she personally went to the eight great clans, Qiu Di had been waiting for good news. ”

“At this moment, the assistant reported, “Eldest miss, the great clan leaders of the eight great clans are here.” ”

“Hearing this, Qiu Di’s eyes lit up and he immediately said, “Quick...” ”

“Halfway through his words, Qiu di seemed to have thought of something. He continued, “Tell him to wait for a while. Tell him that I’m busy.” ”

“Okay.”The assistant nodded and turned to leave.

The head chief was waiting outside.

“At this moment, it was raining heavily. ”

“The other guards were all walking back. Only Ye Han stood alone in the rain, not making a sound. ”

He was like a statue.

“Seeing this, the head chief frowned. ”

“Although ye Han had a good physique, and the strong acid rain was corrosive, humans were not the natives of changyue, so it was okay to get caught in the strong acid rain once in a while, but if he got caught too often, it would affect his life. ”

“At this moment, the assistant walked over, “Head chief, the eldest miss is busy now, please wait for a while. When the eldest miss is done, she will see you.” ”

“”Alright, I’m not in a hurry.”The head chief continued, “It’s raining so heavily, why isn’t Captain Wu coming back to avoid it?” ”

“At the mention of this question, the assistant lowered his voice and said, “Captain Wu is a very strange person. Usually, he only listens to the eldest miss. At this time, if the eldest miss doesn’t let him go back, he definitely won’t go back!” ”

The eldest chief narrowed his eyes. “Then does he always do this? Or is it just once in a while?”

“”Basically, he does this every time,”the assistant said. ”

He always gets drenched in acid rain like this?

“When Ye Zao was around, he didn’t treat ye Han Like This! ”

“If autumn flute was really responsible for Ye Han, then he wouldn’t let ye Han get drenched in acid rain. ”

The eldest chief’s expression became more and more abnormal.

Little did he know that the change in the expression of the head chief was all within Autumn Flute’s grasp.

The reason why she dared to treat ye Han so brazenly was that she had a way to resolve it.

“Not long after, the assistant walked over again, “Head Chief, the eldest miss wants you to enter.” ”

“”Okay.”The head chief reacted and nodded slightly, following the footsteps of the assistant. ”

“Not long after, they arrived at Autumn Flute’s office. ”

“Qiu Di sat in front of his desk and pointed at a chair, “Head clan leader, sit.” ”

“”Miss Qiu, I’m not here to sit today,”the head clan leader said. ”

“Qiu di nodded and continued, “If there’s a problem, just say it.” ”

“The head clan leader asked, “What’s wrong with Team Leader Ye? Why is he outside in the Rain?” ”

“Hearing this, Qiu Di’s eyes were filled with loneliness, she sighed and said, “Speaking of this, I’m not willing to let ye Han be like this. After all, he was the only person that Sister Ye Zhuo could trust when she was alive. However, sister ye Zhuo specifically told him that leader Ye’s constitution was special. He must be drenched in strong acid rain to not remember the past.” ”

“Qiu Di’s eyes gradually reddened as she continued, “Head chief, if you don’t believe me, you can call leader Ye in.” ”

“So it was ye Zao who had specially instructed them. Hearing this, the anger on the head chief’s face disappeared a little. Then, he took out the star crossing table that he had long prepared. “Miss Qiu Di, this is the star crossing table. Please keep it well.” ”

“Qiu Di was stunned. She pretended to be very surprised and said, “Head chief, what are you doing?”She had long known that the head chief would definitely personally send the star crossing table over. ”

As expected!

“The head chief continued, “Miss Qiu Di, you are Miss Ye’s entrusted person. Since Miss Ye has confirmed your identity, then we will not have any objections. The information on the star transference case should be kept by the future female sovereign. If I deliver it to you, it can be considered returning it to its original owner.” ”

“Qiu Di was extremely pleased in her heart, but she did not show it on her face. She continued, “Then I thank the head chief for his trust.” ”

“The great chief smiled and said, “Miss Qiu Di, I believe that you will be able to live up to Miss Ye’s Trust.” ”

He was even more confident that ye Zhuo would not misjudge the person.

“Thank you.”Qiu Di bowed to the great chief.

“After the great chief left, Qiu Chang Zhen rushed over and said excitedly, “Di’er, Shangguan Zhi just came?” ”

“Yes.”Qiu Di nodded.

“Is he here to deliver the information of the star-crossing case?”Autumn town asked.

Autumn flute nodded.

“Autumn town continued, “Where is the information of the star-crossing case?” ” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Here.”Autumn flute handed the information of the star-crossing case to autumn town.

“In the next second, the smile on autumn town’s face stiffened. “Why is there no password?” ”

“Without the password, it meant that those old fellows of the eight great clans were still on guard against autumn flute. This was not a good thing for autumn flute. ”

“Autumn flute slightly curved her lips, the corners of her mouth filled with a proud arc. “Father, don’t be anxious. None of those old fellows from the eight great clans can think of escaping from my grasp.”After she stabilized her position as the matriarch.., the first to be toppled was the eight great clans. ”
