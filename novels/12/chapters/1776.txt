“After arranging the ward, Lin Qingxuan brought Xia Xiaoman to the obstetrics department for a check-up. ”

“It was Lin Qingxuan’s first time being a father. Seeing that Xia Xiaoman had not made any movements until the due date, she was very worried. “Doctor, is my wife Alright? Today is the due date, but why hasn’t she made any movements?” ”

“The Doctor was a middle-aged woman who looked very kind. “Mr. Lin, this is a normal phenomenon. You Don’t have to worry. Have you got the checkup sheet? Let me take a look.” ”

“”Yes, I have it.”Lin Qingxuan immediately handed the checkup sheet to the doctor. ”

“The Doctor took the checkup sheet and looked at it. Then, he said, “Mrs. Lin’s fetal position...” ”

“When Lin Qingxuan heard this, she was extremely anxious. She immediately said, “What’s wrong with the fetal position? Doctor, don’t scare me.” ”

“”Oh, it’s fine, it’s fine.”The Doctor adjusted his glasses, then, he said, “Mr. Lin, you don’t have to be nervous. It’s just that Mrs. Lin is an old woman after all. In addition, the fetal position is somewhat abnormal, so I suggest that you have a caesarean section.” ”

“”Caesarean Section?”Lin Qingxuan asked, “Is a caesarean section safe?” ”

“”Mr. Lin, don’t worry. A caesarean section is the safest surgery.”He paused, the doctor continued, “But you also have to know that there is no surgery in this world that is absolutely safe. Although a caesarean section is safe, it is also dangerous.”No one knew what kind of accident would happen on the operating table. ”

“When he heard this, Lin Qingxuan became even more anxious! ”

The sweat on his forehead almost immediately appeared.

“Seeing how he was, Xia Xiaoman smiled and said, “Qingxuan, I am pregnant. I am not afraid. What are you afraid of?” ”

“Lin Qingxuan held Xia Xiaoman’s hand tightly and turned to look at the doctor. “Doctor, you must let my wife and child be safe and sound! As long as they are safe and sound, I am willing to give them any amount of money!” ”

“The doctor smiled and said, “Mr. Lin, don’t worry. I will do my best.” ”

“Please!”Lin Qingxuan stood up and bowed to the doctor.

“The doctor immediately stood up. “Mr. Lin, you are too polite! This is the responsibility of our doctors! Oh right, quickly go and go through the Caesarean section procedures. According to Mrs. Lin’s current situation, she will be able to perform the Caesarean section tomorrow afternoon.” The doctor then instructed, “Oh right, Mr. Lin, you can’t eat before the Caesarean section procedures. Mrs. Lin, don’t eat anything after 9 pm.” ”

Xia Xiaoman nodded. “Okay.”

“Hearing that Xia Xiaoman was not allowed to eat, Lin Qingxuan said nervously, “What if she’s hungry? She’s two people now, not one person!” ”

“”She can’t eat even if she’s hungry,”the doctor said seriously, “This concerns the life and safety of the pregnant woman and child.” ”

“Hearing this, Lin Qingxuan immediately said, “Don’t worry, I won’t let her have anything.” ”

The doctor nodded. “Then you guys go and go through the procedures.”

“Lin Qingxuan nodded and turned to look at Xia Xiaoman. “I’ll send you to the ward to rest first, and then go through the procedures.” ”

“”There’s no need to rest. I’ll walk with you,”Xia Xiaoman continued. “I suspect that I listened to you. I was too lazy during the entire pregnancy, which is why the fetus wasn’t in the right position.” ”

“Ever since Xia Xiaoman got pregnant, Lin Qingxuan was extremely nervous. He wished that he could even go to the toilet for Xia Xiaoman. ”

“”Then let’s take the stairs,”Lin Qingxuan continued, “The air in the elevator isn’t circulating.” ”

“Okay.”Xia Xiaoman nodded.

“Soon, it was the second day. ”

“After learning that Xia Xiaoman had a c-section today, Ye Shu and ye Langhua came. ”

Old Mrs. Lin was too ashamed to see Xia Xiaoman. She knelt in the temple and prayed for Xia Xiaoman and her unborn child.

Lin Qingxuan stood outside the operating theater and paced back and forth anxiously.

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “Fourth brother, don’t worry. Fourth sister-in-law and the child will be out soon.” ”

“Lin Qingxuan said, “It’s already been two hours.” ”

“At this moment, a loud cry suddenly came from the operating theater. ”

“”WA, WA, wa –” ”

This was the VIP delivery room. Xia Xiaoman was the only one who gave birth today.

“Hearing the cry, Lin Qingxuan was overjoyed. He was about to cry. He immediately ran to the door of the delivery room and peered through the crack of the door. ”

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “I told you that fourth sister-in-law and the child will be out soon.” ”

“How is it? Has My mother given birth yet? Is it a younger brother or a younger sister?”An Lizi was out of breath as she ran over from outside.

“”Yes, it’s born.”Ye Shu smiled and said, “But it hasn’t come out yet. It should be soon.” ”

“Is it a younger brother or a younger sister?”An Lizi was very excited when she heard that Xia Xiaoman had finally given birth.

“Ye Shu said, “I don’t know for the time being. We’ll only know when the Doctor comes out. After the child is born, there should be other things to do.” ”

“OH.”An Lizi nodded.

“Lin Qingxuan was also very anxious. He turned to look at Ye Shu. “Sister-in-law, why isn’t Xiaoman and the baby out yet?”He wished that he could see Xia Xiaoman and the baby right now. ”

“”Wait a little longer. They should be out soon.”Ye Shu smiled and said, “Fourth brother, don’t be anxious.” ”

“”Yes, don’t be anxious.”Although he said that he wasn’t anxious, Lin Qingxuan still walked around on the spot. ”

“About five minutes later, under Lin Qingxuan’s expectant gaze, the door to the delivery room finally opened. The nurse carried the child out. “Mr. Lin, Congratulations. Mother and son are safe.” ”

Lin Qingxuan took the child from the nurse’s hands. He was so excited that he could not control himself.

The child.

This was the child that belonged to him and Xia Xiaoman.

He had been looking forward to this child for decades.

“An Lizi said, “Is it a little brother?” ”

The nurse nodded. “Yes.”

Ye Shu and ye Langhua also walked over to look at the child.

“”Mom, don’t you think this child looks a little like Lizi?” ”

“Ye Langhua looked at the baby with a smile. “His nose is like your fourth brother’s, and his eyes are like big sister Lizi’s. His ears are exactly the same as your fourth brother’s.” ”

Ye Shu looked at the baby very carefully and smiled. “It really is! Look at how cute his little eyes and nose are!”

“When Ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing arrived at the hospital, it was already afternoon. ”

Xia Xiaoman was lying on the hospital bed. She was already awake and the baby was sleeping next to her.

“Ye Zhuo said, “Lizi, brother or sister?” ”

“An Lizi said, “Brother! Big Zhuozhuo, you’re finally here. My parents have been waiting for you for a long time!” ”

“Waiting for me for what?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“Waiting for you to give my brother a name.”

“Me?”Ye Zhuo was stunned.

Give him a name? Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

This ye Zhuo really didn’t have much experience.

“However, it was as if she had experienced all of this somewhere before. ”

It was as if she had once given someone else a name.

Was her memory messed up?

“At this moment, Lin Qingxuan walked over. “Yes. Zhuozhuo, if it weren’t for you, your fourth aunt and I wouldn’t have had this child. Hence, your fourth aunt and I have unanimously decided that the child’s name will be given to you.” ”
