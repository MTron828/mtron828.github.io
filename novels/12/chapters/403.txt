Chapter 404: 117: Cen Shaoqing was Cen Wu Ye. He was so regretful that his intestines turned green! 7

Translator: 549690339

Cen Shaoqing turned his eyes slightly. “You’re even better.”

“Ye Zhuo leaned against the car door, took off his sunglasses, and played with them in his hands. “Other than you, no one else could almost fight me to a draw!” ”

“What a coincidence.”Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads. “You’re also the first person to beat me.”

Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly. “I can see that.”

One had to admit that Cen Shaoqing was really strong.

“If she let down her guard a little today, it was very likely that she would lose to Cen Shaoqing. ”

“In the past, no one had ever been able to pose a threat to her. ”

Cen Shaoqing was the first.

Cen Shaoqing opened the car door and took out a beautiful thermos cup from inside. “Grandma asked me to bring this for you. She said that you especially like to drink this sweet soup made by this chef.”

“Hearing the word sweet soup, ye Zhuo’s eyes lit up. He quickly reached out and took it. “Thank Grandma Cen for me!” ”

“You don’t have to be polite with her.”Cen Shaoqing’s tone was indifferent.

Ye Zhuo opened the thermos cup and took a sip.

It was ice-cold.

It was simply too delicious!

“Why do you like sweet food so much?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Because sweet food can make people happy.” ”

The main reason was related to ye Zao’s childhood experience.

Ye Zao had been an orphan since he was young.

“To the children of ordinary families, sugar was so ordinary that it couldn’t be used as an ordinary food. ”

“But to her, it was extremely precious. ”

“Ye Zao still remembered that on that cold snowy night, it was Grandma’s bowl of sweet soup that saved her life. ”

Unfortunately.

Grandma left too early.

She couldn’t let Grandma live a good life.

“From then on, Ye Zao began to study medicine and became stronger. ”

“At that time, she was 13 years old. ”

“About 15 minutes later, he ziteng drove the car to the finish line. ”

It wasn’t that he was too slow!

It was that these two people were too abnormal!

This section of the Winding Mountain Road was more than 70 kilometers. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

These two people finished it in 10 minutes.

“If they hadn’t seen it with their own eyes, who would believe it? ”

“”Idol, fifth brother, who won just now?” ”

Cen Shaoqing continued to count the Buddhist beads. “Ye Zhuo beat me.”

“F * ck!”He ziteng was stunned again.

One had to know that Cen Shaoqing was the king of cars back then!

He didn’t expect that ye Zhuo would actually beat Cen Shaoqing.

Ye Zhuo drank a mouthful of sweet soup. “I was just lucky enough to win against him. There was only a difference of thirty seconds between the two of us.”

He ziteng gulped.

How could these two people say such a terrifying thing so casually?

...

Li Qiandong accompanied mu yourong to the suburbs to relax. He only sent Mu Yourong back in the afternoon.

“Mu yourong said, “Big Brother Li, if you don’t mind, why don’t you come upstairs with me and have a cup of tea? Thank you for enlightening me today. My mood is much better now.” ”

“You’re welcome. We’ve agreed that I want to be your good friend for the rest of my life.”

The two of them went to the MU residence together.

The Mu residence was rented on the top floor.

Mu Yourong reached out and knocked on the door.

“But after knocking for a long time, Shen Rong did not come over to open the door. “Is my mother not at Home?” ”

“Did you bring the key?”

Mu Yourong began to rummage through her bag. “Let me look for it.”

“After rummaging through it for a long time, Mu Yourong finally found the key in her bag. ”

“The moment she opened the door, a pungent smell rushed out from inside. ”

It was the smell of natural gas!

Mu Yourong’s face turned pale and she ran inside. “Mother!”

Li Qiandong also ran inside.

The room was filled with a pungent smell and it was almost impossible to breathe. Li Qiandong hurriedly opened all the doors and windows.

Then he went to the kitchen to turn off the gas.

“There was bone soup simmering on the stove and the soup spilled all over the stove. Looking at the scene, one could infer that it was because the soup was boiling and no one turned off the fire, causing the soup to overflow and put out the fire, causing the gas to leak. ”

Li Qiandong quickly turned off the gas stove.

Shen Rong was lying on the sofa. Her entire face was dark and there was not a single sign of life on her body.

“”Mom! Mom!”Mu Yourong panicked. She lay on the ground and cried, “Mom, are you okay? Mom, say something!” ”

“Li Qiandong said, “Hurry up and call 120!” ”

Mu Yourong’s hands trembled as she took out her phone and called 120.

120 ambulance arrived very quickly.

“But after the medical staff checked, they confirmed that Shen Rong was no longer breathing. “I’m sorry, but there are no signs of life on your mother.” ”

No signs of life.

“Hearing this, Mu Yourong heaved a sigh of relief. ”

It seemed that she had controlled the time very well. It was neither too early nor too late. She was most afraid of turning into a half-dead state.

“In the next second, Mu Yourong cried and knelt down to the doctor. “No! It’s impossible! Doctor, please save my mother! Please! I Can’t lose my mother! Please!” ”

“The doctor was also helpless. “Madam, please don’t be like this. If I could save her, I would definitely save her. But now, there’s really no hope for your mother.” ”

“Mu Yourong was unwilling to believe this reality. “Doctor, I’m begging you. As long as you can save my mother, I’ll be your slave! I’m willing to give up everything! Please!” ”

The doctor shook his head helplessly.

“Li Qiandong’s eyes were red as he pulled mu yourong up. “Yourong, calm down.” ”

“Big Brother Li!”Mu Yourong hugged Li Qiandong and burst into tears.

“Li Qiandong’s heart ached terribly. “Yourong, don’t worry. Auntie is no longer around. You still have me in the future. I’ll take good care of you.” ”

“”It’s all my fault! If I hadn’t gone out to relax and stayed at home to accompany my mother, something like that wouldn’t have happened to her! It’s all my fault! I’m not a good daughter!” ”

“Li Qiandong comforted her, “Yourong, you mustn’t think like this. This isn’t your fault, because no one could have predicted that this would happen.” ”
