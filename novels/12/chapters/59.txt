Chapter 60: Born To Be A King

Madam Lin looked at Lin Jincheng’s back and sighed deeply.

This child was good in everything, but he was too loyal in a relationship!

Unfortunately, he had met the wrong person and was infatuated with the wrong person. Ye Shu was simply not worthy of his long-lasting love.

At this moment, the sound of a servant knocking on the door came from outside.

“Madam Lin, Miss Qianhua is here.”

Hearing this, Old Madam Lin’s eyes lit up and she immediately went to the living room.

“Qianhua.”

“Aunt Lin.” Feng Qianhua held a thermos bucket in her hand and said gently, “This is the bone soup that I specially brewed for you. There are some health-preserving herbs in it. Please drink it while it’s hot.”

Feng Qianhua was 39 years old this year and she had taken very good care of herself. She looked like she was only 23 or 24 years old. She was pretty and elegant, and she looked very kind. No matter when or where, she maintained a decent smile on her face, it was as if she had never been angry.

Feng Qianhua and Lin Jincheng grew up together, and the two of them were like childhood sweethearts.

Feng Qianhua also liked Lin Jincheng very much.

When their parents were still young, they even had a verbal marriage contract.

Unfortunately, it was a one-sided love. Lin Jincheng wasn’t in love with Feng Qianhua.

When she learned that Lin Jincheng had given up on her for an extremely ordinary woman, Feng Qianhua got angry and married a man of equal status.

Not long after the two of them got married, her husband died in a car accident. At that time, Feng Qianhua had just gotten pregnant.

Madam Lin felt extremely guilty because of this. She felt that the Lin family had let Feng Qianhua down. If Lin Jincheng had not broken the verbal marriage contract, Feng Qianhua would not have lost her husband at such a young age.

Moreover, after Feng Qianhua lost her husband, she did not remarry. She had been waiting for Lin Jincheng, so Madam Lin liked her very much. She had long treated her as the future daughter-in-law of the Lin family.

“It’s such a hot day. You must be tired.”

Feng Qianhua poured a bowl of soup and handed it to Madam Lin. “Not at all. You’ve been taking care of me all these years. This is what I should do.”

Madam Lin took the bowl and drank a mouthful of soup. “Oh right, why haven’t I seen Xianxian?”

Feng Xianxian was Feng Qianhua’s daughter. After her husband died, Feng Qianhua did not abort the child. Instead, she chose to give birth to it.

Feng Qianhua smiled and said, “Xianxian has returned to school today.”

“Oh.”Madam Lin nodded.

Feng Qianhua looked at Madam Lin and said hesitantly, “Aunt Lin, my mother left this world early. I have always treated you as my biological mother. There is something I don’t know whether to say or not.”

“Qianhua, we are just like mother and daughter. You can say whatever you wish to say. There is no need to be so formal.”

“In that case, I’ll say it.” Feng Qianhua chose her words carefully in her heart, then, she said, “Recently, I’ve heard some rumors about Ah Ze’s mother being pregnant with fraternal twins back in the day. No matter what happened back then, that child is still the Lin family’s flesh and blood. She’s your granddaughter, Brother Jincheng’s daughter, and Ah Ze’s younger sister. Do you really have the heart to let the mother and daughter wander outside?”

At this point, Feng Qianhua grabbed Madam Lin’s hand, and she said earnestly, “Aunt Lin, I’m also a widowed mother, a single mother. I know how difficult it is for a woman to raise a child! Please forgive Sister Ye Shu! I can see that brother Jincheng still loves Sister Ye Shu very much, even until this day.”

“Silly child, everything about you is good except that you’re too kind!” Madam Lin patted Feng Qianhua’s hand, “Qianhua, don’t underestimate that woman, Ye Shu! Do you really think that my heart is made of iron? If that child really is of the Lin family’s bloodline, would I just let them wander the streets?”

After so many years, Madam Lin had actually come to an understanding.

If that child was Lin Jincheng’s biological daughter, she would definitely step forward to bring the mother and daughter back.

Their Lin family had always only given birth to boys, not girls.

Madam Lin had a total of five sons, eleven grandchildren, and three great-grandsons, but she did not have a granddaughter. She had always dreamed of having a granddaughter.

When she found out that she still had a granddaughter wandering outside, the old lady was overjoyed.

Who would have thought…

Who would have thought that in the end, she was happy for nothing.

Hearing this, Feng Qianhua was shocked.

“Aunt Lin, what do you mean by this?”

Madam Lin Sighed. “That child is not Jincheng’s biological daughter!”

“No way!” Feng Qianhua covered her mouth in disbelief. “I’ve seen Sister Ye Shu before! She isn’t that kind of person! Aunt Lin, you must be mistaken!”

“I went to the hospital to conduct a test.” Madam Lin continued, “Just like you, Jincheng was skeptical. He even went abroad to do five tests without my knowing, but the results are all the same.”

“But isn’t that child and Ah Ze twins?”

Madam Lin replied, “I asked the doctor, and the doctor said that it is possible to have identical twins from different fathers.”

Feng Qianhua was stunned, but she still defended Ye Shu. “Aunt Lin, I can guarantee that Sister Ye Shu is definitely not that kind of person!”

Madam Lin’s expression turned cold. “Qianhua, don’t put in a good word for her anymore! Ye Shu is a fickle woman, and she doesn’t deserve your compassion! In my Heart, you are the most suitable wife for Jincheng!”

Hearing that, Feng Qianhua’s lips curled into a bitter smile. “Aunt Lin, actually, I am already very satisfied that I can be by you and Brother Jincheng’s side all these years. I have never had any delusions of marrying Brother Jincheng.

“Love is giving, not possessing. I prefer Brother Jincheng to be happy!”

Feng Qianhua was so kind.

She had never hated Lin Jincheng.

Even though her husband had died and she had been a widow for so many years, she had never complained. Instead, she often spoke well of Ye Shu in front of Madam Lin.

“Silly child!” Madam Lin poked Feng Qianhua’s forehead, “Let me tell you, you have to be more selfish! You are just too kind, that’s why you let that Ye Shu take Jincheng away! I don’t care. In my heart, you’re my daughter-in-law! I treat Xianxian as my biological granddaughter. It just so happens that our Lin family hasn’t had a girl for so many years! In the future, Xianxian will be the apple of our family’s eye!”

A glimmer of light flashed across Feng Qianhua’s lowered eyes. “Aunt Lin, please don’t make fun of me.”

“What I said is true. I’m not joking.” Madam Lin’s face was serious.

At this moment, soft footsteps sounded in the living room. Feng Qianhua turned her head to see a tall and straight figure approaching against the light. The impetuousness of the 39-year-old man had faded, and his entire body was filled with a steady aura.

In addition, Lin Jincheng had been the head of the Lin family for many years. He held a high position and had an imposing aura that emanated from him even when he was not angry. Such a man was the most charming.

His broken right leg didn’t affect him at all. On the contrary, it added to his unique charm.

There were countless socialites in the capital who wanted to get close to Lin Jincheng.

Unfortunately, after so many years, no one could catch his eye.

Feng Qianhua stood up with a slightly red face. “Brother Jincheng, I made soup for Aunt Lin. Do you want some?”

“Thank you, but that won’t be necessary.” Lin Jincheng strode out.

To her, he would always be like this.

In the past, Feng Qianhua thought that Lin Jincheng was naturally this way. It wasn’t until one afternoon that she unexpectedly saw Lin Jincheng and Ye Shu together.

At that time, Feng Qianhua realized that he wasn’t born like this.

However, even after finding out that Ye Shu had betrayed him, he still only had eyes for her. Could it be that in Lin Jincheng’s eyes, she was worse than a fickle woman?

Madam Lin smiled and said, “Qianhua, don’t blame him. Jincheng is always like this. If he doesn’t want to drink it, I’ll drink it! It’s his loss if he doesn’t drink such delicious soup!”

The smile on Feng Qianhua’s face did not fade. “Aunt Lin, Brother Jincheng and I grew up together. No one knows him better than me. Why would I blame him?”

Madam Lin patted Feng Qianhua’s hand. “That’s why I said that out of all these individuals, you’re the most suitable for Jincheng.”

Feng Qianhua was kind and generous. She also knew her place and had an obedient and cute daughter.

Madam Lin was really satisfied with her.

…

Back in Yunjing Province, Ye Zhuo stayed in school for the entire day.

The news of her transformation had spread throughout the entire campus. When class ended, many students from other classes came to Class 7 to investigate.

As today was her first day of in the new class, Ye Zhuo did not play with her phone. Instead, she listened to the class very seriously.

At night, when she returned home from school, Ye Zhuo turned on her computer to work on her task.

Two-thirds of the OS system had been completed.

The rest could be done with her phone.

Ye Zhuo took the time to reply to the client’s message while working on the code.

Soon, it was eight o’clock. It was the busiest time in the restaurant. Ye Zhuo turned off her computer and went to the restaurant to help.

Meanwhile, Li Qiandong closed his computer and turned to look at Cen Shaoqing. “Brother Fifth, I just asked the god Niohuru.YZ. The god said that the OS system will be completed next week!”

Cen Shaoqing lay lazily on the sofa. He held his head with one hand and the prayer beads with the other. His slender fingers continuously twirled them.

There seemed to be no expression on his face.

When he heard this, he slowly raised his eyelids and revealed a pair of deep eyes. “Have you found out the true identity of Niohuru.YZ?”

“Not yet.” Li Qiandong shook his head.

The god was too powerful!

They had no idea where to start.

Li Qiandong continued, “Let’s not talk about this for now. Brother Fifth, I recently discovered a restaurant. Their dishes are very delicious! Especially the rabbit head! It’s so fragrant! Let’s eat there tonight!”

“Also, they serve vegetarian hot pot. I guarantee that you’ll fall in love with it after eating it once!”

…

Somewhere else, Mu Yourong had learned of Li Qiandong’s whereabouts. She immediately brought Zeng Rou and Lin Wuyue to Ye Family’s Private Kitchen.

After all, only the presence of green leaves could accentuate the noble and beautiful Kaolin flower!

Thus, Mu Yourong always brought these two green leaves with her wherever she went.

After arriving at her destination, Mu Yourong discovered that Ye Zhuo was working as a waitress at the restaurant!

Although this restaurant was called Ye Family’s Private Kitchen, Mu Yourong did not think that this restaurant had anything to do with Ye Zhuo at all.

Ye Zhuo was just a piece of trash. How could she afford to open a shop?

It was simply a fantasy!

However, Mu Yourong’s focus today was not on Ye Zhuo. She quickly discovered Li Qiandong’s figure. There was also a man sitting opposite Li Qiandong.

His back was facing her, so his face could not be seen.

However, just his back alone made Mu Yourong’s heart tremble and her entire body turn cold!

This person was born to be a king.

According to the system, Li Qiandong and Fifth Master Cen had a close relationship. Could this person be Fifth Master Cen?

Besides Fifth Master Cen, who else had such an aura?

It seemed that she had come to the right place this time.

Mu Yourong curled the corners of her lips and gave Lin Wuyue and Zeng Rou a look. “Let’s sit over there.”

“Alright.”

The three of them sat at the table next to Li Qiandong.

“Waiter, we would like to order!”

Ye Zhuo jogged over. “May I ask what the three of you would like to eat?”

It was also at this moment that Ye Zhuo realized that the three of them were her old nemesis.

Were they here to cause trouble again?

Ye Zhuo raised her eyebrows without batting an eyelid.

Mu Yourong continued, “Can I trouble you to introduce the specialties here?”

Ye Zhuo said, “The spicy rabbit head is not bad, you can try it.”

If she remembered correctly, Fifth Master Cen was a vegetarian. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Mu Yourong naturally would not miss the opportunity to show off in front of Fifth Master Cen. She said incredulously, “Rabbit? Rabbits are so cute, how can we eat them?”

Ye Zhuo smiled faintly, the light in her eyes beaming. “Rats are not cute, should I give you one?”
