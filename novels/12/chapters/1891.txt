“As a parent, none of them could accept their daughter marrying far away. ”

“Not to mention the Jones family, even if the other party was a prince of C Nation, Fang yinyue would refuse without hesitation. ”

Didn’t want Li Yueyue to marry too far away?

What did Fang yinyue mean?

“But thinking of her cousin’s request, Li Shuyi still held her temper and said, “Little aunt, the traffic is so convenient now. Whenever you want to see Yueyue, just fly a plane over to see her!” ”

“Li Sanzhu, who had been silent all this time, opened his mouth at this time, “Shuyi, do you have anything else?” ”

“”What’s the matter, uncle?”Li Shuyi looked at Li Sanzhu. ”

“Li Sanzhu continued, “If you have nothing else to do, go back and rest early.” ”

“Li Shuyi did not understand the Chinese euphemism. She only thought that Li Sanzhu was simply asking her to go back and rest. She continued, “Little uncle, what do you think about Yueyue’s matter? Should we arrange for both your parents to meet, or...” ”

“”What your aunt means is what I mean.”Li sanzhu frowned and said, “I’m the same as her. We don’t really want Yueyue to get married far away. Moreover, Yueyue is still young. We don’t want her to get married too early.” ”

Li Shuyi’s expression was a little ugly.

“After all her calculations, she did not expect Li Sanzhu and Fang yinyue to have such a reaction! ”

It was a little disgusting!

They really thought that Li Yueyue was something.

“If it was in the past, how would John have taken a fancy to Li Yueyue? ”

“But now, they were under the same roof and had no choice but to lower their heads. ”

They were faking it.

They were definitely faking it.

Being able to marry into the Jones family was simply a blessing that Li Yueyue had cultivated in her past life. How could Li Sanzhu and Fang yinyue bear to reject it?

The reason why they reacted like this was nothing more than to raise their status again.

They really thought that she didn’t understand their little tricks.

“Li Shuyi put on a fake smile and continued, “Little uncle, little aunt, then I Won’t disturb you.” ”

“En.”Li Sanzhu nodded.

“Fang yinyue looked at Li Shuyi’s departing figure and snorted coldly, “Look, this is your good niece! What’s This!” ”

Li Sanzhu’s face was also a little embarrassed.

He did not expect his second brother’s family to have such thoughts.

“In the business world, everyone knew that the Jones family had long fallen into disarray. Ever since the new king took over, the Jones family’s power had started to crumble bit by bit. ”

The current Jones family was just a facade.

The reason why the Jones family looked for Li Yueyue and wanted to form a marriage alliance with the Li family was simply to borrow the power of the Li family.

“Obviously, the Jones family was daydreaming. It was as if Li Yueyue wanted to throw herself at the Jones family. No one knew where Li Shuyi’s face came from. ”

“Li Sanzhu was very angry, but Li Shuyi was his niece after all. There were some things that could not be directly triggered! ”

“After calming down for a moment, Li Sanzhu turned to look at Fang yinyue, “Yinyue, don’t worry. I will definitely be on the same side as you! I will never let our Yueyue marry into C Nation!” ”

“I don’t even want to talk about your second brother and second sister-in-law!”Fang yinyue was speechless. “Is this what an uncle and aunt should do? It’s really disgusting! Do you know how disgusting it is? They really treat our family as fools! They’re the smartest people in the world!”

“At this moment, Li Sanzhu could only smile apologetically. After all, it was his second brother and second sister-in-law who were at fault. He was not in the right to do this. ”

“On the other side, Li Shuyi ran into Cen Shaoqing and ye Zhuo who had just returned from their trip. ”

Li Shuyi did not say anything. She walked around the two of them and walked over.

Trash’s best friend was also trash!

They were all trash!

“People like Cen Shaoqing and ye Zhuo were obviously the poor relatives that her mother, Linda, had described. ”

Such people were the most disgusting.

“At this moment, a slender figure walked over from the side. “Shuyi.” ”

Li Shuyi smiled and looked at the person. “Ai Ru.”

Ai Ru was a Korean woman who had the same face as the Chinese.

“She was mature and elegant. Her plain yellow dress was even more elegant. Ai Ru looked at Li Shuyi and said, “Shuyi, who was that just now? He looks familiar.” ”

“Li Shuyi frowned and asked, “Who are you talking about?” ”

“The man and the woman just now.”

“”I don’t know either. He’s my aunt’s poor relative,”Li Shuyi said. ”

“Ai Ru didn’t care about the word ‘poor relative’. She smiled and said, “It’s not easy for your uncle and aunt.” ”
