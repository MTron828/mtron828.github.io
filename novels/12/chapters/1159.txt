Translator: 549690339

“Time ticked by. It was almost 11 o’clock and ye Zhuo was still not here. Jiang Chao looked at his phone and asked, “Xiaoyu, does this miss ye not want to come?” ”

“”No,”Jiang Xiaoyu said, “She’s not that kind of person.” ”

“Jiang Chao said, “But it’s almost 11 o’clock in five minutes. Why isn’t she here yet?” ”

“Jiang Xiaoyu looked outside and said, “It’s probably because of the delay on the road! Dad, don’t be anxious! Isn’t it not 11 o’clock yet?” ”

Jiang Chao took a sip of his coffee.

“At this moment, Jiang Xiaoyu’s eyes lit up. “She’s Here! She’s Here!” ”

“Jiang Chao put down his cup and said somewhat excitedly, “Miss Ye is here?” ”

“Yes!”Jiang Xiaoyu nodded.

Jiang Chao also looked outside. “Which one is Miss Ye?”

“Jiang Xiaoyu said, “The one in the Black Windbreaker!” ”

“Black Windbreaker?”Jiang Chao frowned. “There are quite a few people in black windbreakers outside. Which one is the Miss Ye You’re talking about?”

“Jiang Xiaoyu continued, “The most beautiful one!” ”

The most beautiful one?

Jiang Chao’s gaze immediately shifted to a slender figure. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

The girl was wearing a black windbreaker and a black hat on her head.

“The wide brim of the hat covered her eyes, and only a part of her fair chin could be seen. ”

Her aura was so strong that it was difficult to ignore her!

“That person wearing the hat is Miss Ye?”Jiang Chao asked with some uncertainty.

“Yes.”Jiang Xiaoyu nodded.

“Seeing that the figure had already walked into the coffee shop, Jiang Xiaoyu waved her hand and said, “Great Burning! This way!” ”

“Ye Zhuoluo walked over and took off his hat, revealing a face that was as beautiful as a painting. ”

Devastatingly beautiful.

Cold and aloof.

It was just that... he was a little young.

He looked like he was at most 18 or 19 years old.

Could such a young girl really bring the Jiang Corporation out of their predicament?

Jiang Chao was a little worried.

“At this moment, Ye Zhuoluo walked to the table and said, “Xiaoyu.” ”

“Jiang Xiaoyu stood up and said, “Da Zhuozhuo, this is my dad! Dad, this is president ye of the Shunxi Financial Group!” ”

“Jiang Chao stood up and extended his hand to Ye Zhuo. “Hello, President Ye. I’m Jiang Chao.” ”

“Uncle Jiang.”Ye Zhuo extended his hand to hold Jiang Chao’s hand.

“”President Ye, please take a seat.” ”

Ye Zhuo leaned over and sat down.

“Jiang Xiaoyu handed the menu to Ye Zhuo. “Da Zhuozhuo, what would you like to drink?” ”

Ye Zao took the menu. “A half-sugar cappuccino.”

Jiang Xiaoyu called the waiter over.

“Apart from the cappuccino, he also ordered some desserts. ”

“Over the past few days, Jiang Xiaoyu had already figured out ye Zao’s taste. ”

“The Cappuccino was served very quickly. Ye Zao picked up the cup and took a sip. Then, he took out a document and went straight to the point. “Uncle Jiang, this is my customized plan for the problems that the Jiang Financial Group has encountered. Please take a look.” ”

Plan?

Ye Zhuo made it himself?

Could a teenager really come up with a plan?

“Jiang Chao was stunned at first, then he took the document with both hands. ”

“Jiang Chao didn’t have any confidence in this document at first, but he was shocked when he opened it. ”

“The more he read, the more shocked he was. ”

“If he hadn’t seen it with his own eyes, who would believe that such a sophisticated plan was made by an eighteen or nineteen-year-old girl? ”

Ye Zhuo was indeed a descendant of the Ye family!

“At the end of the document, Jiang Chao’s eyes were only filled with amazement. ”

“At this moment, Ye Zhuo took out another document. “If uncle Jiang doesn’t think it’s a problem, then sign this contract.” ”

“Jiang Chao looked up at Ye Zhuo. “President Ye, can I take a look at the contents of the contract first?” ”

“Of course.”

The contract was very thick. There were more than fifty pages in total.

Jiang Chao read page by page.

Ye Zhuo wasn’t in a hurry. He picked up a dessert and slowly tasted it.

“It wasn’t until ye Zhuo finished his third dessert that Jiang Chao finished reading the contract. He raised his head to look at Ye Zhuo. “President Ye, you’ve seen the current situation of our Jiang Financial Group. Aren’t you afraid of making a loss?” ”

The current Jiang Financial Group was completely an empty shell.

It wasn’t enough to just have a plan. They had to invest a huge amount of money.

If it failed...

It would be a huge loss.

“Jiang Chao didn’t understand where Ye Zhuo, a teenage girl, got the courage to make such a deal! ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled slightly and said, “Don’t worry. I’m a person who eats everything. I Won’t lose anything.” ”

Jiang Chao was stunned.

Confidence.

She was too confident.

This kind of confidence was different from conceit.

Her confidence was completely emitted from her bones.

“It couldn’t be replicated, nor could it be imitated. ”
