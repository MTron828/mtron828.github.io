“Chapter 2042: 426: too late to regret, the day of the election! 6”

Ye Lan did not say a word.

“Grandma Fei continued, “Ever since you betrayed searing, you have no right to call her sister! She doesn’t have a sister like you, and you are even more unworthy of the surname Ye! Your surname is Zuo, and your name is Zuo Huayi!” ”

“”No, my surname is not Zuo,”ye Lan cried, “My surname is Ye! My Name Is Ye Lan! Grandma Fei, please don’t treat me like this!” ”

She had nothing now. Was Grandma Fei going to cancel her right to have her surname Ye?

“”Zuo Huayi, you can go!”Grandma Fei continued, “From now on, we will return to the bridge, and the road will return to the road. We have nothing to do with each other anymore!” ”

“After saying this, Grandma Fei closed the door. ”

“Ye Lan looked at the closed door, her eyes filled with despair. ” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“She didn’t expect Grandma Zuo to be so resolute, and she didn’t expect herself to end up in this state. ”

She couldn’t give up.

“Ye Lan said loudly, “Grandma Fei, if you don’t forgive me, I will kneel at your door for a long time.” ”

She was a child that Grandma Fei had watched grow up with her own eyes. She believed that Grandma Fei wouldn’t be able to watch her like this.

Ye Lan knelt there just like that.

...

On the other side.

Yi Ling was curled up on the sofa. Guang Xing was holding a hair dryer to blow its fur.

“”Here, here a little. Yes, yes, yes, that’s it!”Yi Ling was directing him to blow in that direction. ”

“Guang Xing, who had been washed up, seemed to have changed into a different person. ”

He was full of vitality.

“If one did not see it with their own eyes, who would believe that this was the same person as the unkempt youth from before. ”

“Moreover, Guangxing’s adaptability was very fast. He could learn many high-tech products as long as he was told once. ”

“After drying the fur on his body, Yi Ling sat there like an old man and said, “Guangxing, bring me a strawberry-flavored nutrient solution.” ”

“Before this, the nutrient solution of Changyue had the same taste. ”

It was bitter and astringent.

This fruit-flavored nutrient solution was ye Zhuo’s new product and had not been promoted yet.

“Okay.”Guang Xing nodded and turned around to get the nutrient solution.

“After taking a few steps, Guang Xing stopped and looked at Ye Zhuo. “Grandma, do you want it?” ”

Grandma?

“Although she had been called ‘Grandma’by Guang Xing for almost a day, ye Zhuo was still not used to it. She gulped and turned to look at Guang Xing. “You should call me sister.” ”

She was only twenty-one years old...

How did she become a Grandma?

“”Yes,”Yi Ling followed. “Just call me sister Zao.” ”

“”No,”Guangxing’s eyes were very determined. “You Are My Grandma.” ”

Ye Zao:”...”

“Yi Ling covered her mouth and snickered. “Big Zao, this great grandson of mine fell from the sky. Don’t give him up for nothing.” ”

“Ye Zao said somewhat helplessly, “Alright, you can call him whatever you want.” ”

“The corners of Guang Xing’s mouth curled up into a smile. “Grandma, what flavor of nutrient solution do you want?” ”

“”En.”At this moment, Ye Zao was indeed a little hungry. After hesitating for a moment, he continued, “White Peach Flavor.” ”

“Okay.”

“Very soon, Guang Xing brought two different flavors of nutrient solution over. ”

“Ye Zao drank a small mouthful of nutrient solution. When it entered his mouth, a burst of peach blossom fragrance assailed his nostrils, followed by a thick peach flesh and fruit fragrance. It was as if he was really eating peaches. ”

She really missed the delicacies on earth.

“In the days since she came to changyue, ye Zhuo had been relying on these nutrient solutions to prolong her life. ”

“She didn’t think much of it in the past. After all, the people of Changyue ate nutrient solutions. But now, it was different. She had eaten so many delicious foods, and her stomach had long been spoiled. ”

“”It’s really too delicious!”Yi ling sighed, “Da Zhuo Zhuo, are the strawberries on earth really that delicious?” ”

“”En.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and continued, “The delicious things on Earth are far more than these fruits!” ”

“Then what else is there?”Yi Ling asked.

“Ye Zhuo thought for a moment and continued, “Something that tastes ten times, a hundred times better than the strawberry nutrient solution!” ”

“Really?”

“”En.”Ye Zhuo continued, “After I finish the things on hand, I’ll bring you to Earth to see the world.” ”

“Upon hearing this, stars almost appeared in Yi Ling’s eyes. She jumped up and said, “Okay, okay! Long live the Burning Sun!” ”

“After finishing the nutrient solution, ye Zhuo noticed that Guangxing’s hand was empty. It was lunchtime now. Was Guangxing not hungry? ”

“Why don’t you take a nutrient solution?”Ye Zhuo asked.

Guangxing shook his head. “I’m not hungry.”

“”It’s been six hours since breakfast. You’re not an Iron Man, so how can you not be hungry?”Ye Zhuo continued, “Guangxing, in the future, treat this place as your home. You can do whatever you want to eat.” ”
