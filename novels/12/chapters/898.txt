“Your mother is right.”Father Zhou nodded.

“”Oh right, that Cen family’s fourth young miss is already 39 years old and has yet to get married. Could she be a second-hand woman?” Mother Zhou continued, “Forget it, forget it. On account of the Cen family’s power and influence, I won’t mind this!””

“As long as there was profit to be made, everything was not a problem.”

“Zhou rui smiled and said, “She hasn’t been married before.””

“”Not married before?”Mother Zhou said in surprise, “She’s already thirty-nine years old and still can’t get married! Is she so ugly that no one wants her?””

“”Other than being a little old, she’s still pretty good-looking,”Zhou Rui said.”

“Mother Zhou continued, “Rui Rui, then you have to coax this Cen family’s fourth young miss well. You Can’t let her be cheated away by others!””

“Zhou Rui patted his chest. “Don’t worry, Cen Yuyan won’t marry without me!””

“”Really?”Mother Zhou looked at Zhou Rui and said proudly, “My son is really capable!””

That was the Cen family’s fourth young miss.

“In ancient times, she would have been a princess-like existence.”

Zhou Rui was the prince consort who enjoyed boundless glory. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

They were relatives of the royal family.

How could an ordinary person become the son-in-law of the Cen Family?

“”Of course it’s true,”Zhou Rui continued. “In order to please you and dad, CEN Yuyan is already selecting gifts for you and Dad.””

“Then when will she come to Our House?”Mother Zhou asked.

“Zhou Rui said, “Saturday.””

“After that.., zhou rui continued, “Although Cen Yuyan is the Cen family’s fourth young miss, she is no different from an ordinary woman in my eyes. On Saturday, the two of you don’t have to act too humble. Just put on the airs you should, but don’t overdo it.””

Song Chenyu had specially instructed him about this issue.

Cen Yuyan did not like flattery.

“If the Zhou family’s parents tried to curry favor with Cen Yuyan, Cen Yuyan would look down on them instead.”

“Mother Zhou frowned. “I can’t curry favor, but I can’t overdo it. What do you want me to do?””

“Zhou rui smiled and said, “Wait for Cen Yuyan to curry favor with you. When she comes to curry favor with you, just follow the steps.””

“Mother Zhou’s eyes lit up. She stood up and said, “I understand this. It’s called refusing and welcoming, right?””

“Yes.”Zhou Rui nodded. That was what he meant.

On the other side.

The second episode of country officially began filming.

“Other than song yiwan, the other seven guests had all returned.”

“After what happened, it was impossible for song Yiwan to continue developing in the entertainment industry. Song Yiwan’s position in country was also replaced by another newcomer.”

“With the example from the previous episode, the program team had reduced the exploration segment for this episode.”

“During the break, the assistant ran over. “Sister Chenyu! Sister Chenyu, someone is here to visit!””

Visit?

Song Chenyu narrowed her eyes.

Who was back to visit her?

Lu Xiu?

“At this moment, a handsome figure appeared in song Chenyu’s line of sight.”

He was dressed in a suit.

“Even though he did not see his face, he could already feel that aura.”

This was...

Song Shiyu!

“Third brother!”Song Chenyu immediately stood up from his stool.

Why was song Shiyu Here?

Could it be because of the previous incident?

Was he here to seek justice for himself?

“When he saw song Shiyu, song Chenyu immediately found his pillar of support.”

“”Third brother, why are you here?””

Song Shiyu’s expression did not change. “I came to see you.”

“When the director saw Song Shiyu, he immediately went up to him. “CEO song!””

Song Shiyu nodded.

“The director continued, “CEO song, are you and Chenyu brother and sister?””

“Yes.”

“The director looked at song Shiyu in surprise, then turned to look at song Chenyu.”

“Song Chenyu had debuted for so many years, but he had never known that she and song Shiyu were actually brother and sister!”

Song Shiyu’s gaze unintentionally swept across a spot not far away.

A hint of warmth appeared in his pair of cold eyes.

At this moment.

Xiu —

The Shuttlecock flew over.

What a coincidence.

It landed on song Shiyu’s face.

Pa..

“Song Chenyu widened his eyes in surprise. “Third brother, are you alright?””

This shuttlecock belonged to ye Zao.

“In order to make a name for himself on the show, ye Zao used chicken feathers and toothpaste boxes to make a shuttlecock. When he was free, he would kick the shuttlecock with Yin Wei.”

It would have been fine if it had hit someone else.

However...

This person was song Shiyu.

Song Shiyu was a person with a severe mania. He was temperamental and could not stand the slightest bit of anger.

What is the difference between this action and touching a tiger’s buttocks?

“Moreover, song Shiyu this trip is to give her revenge.”

He will easily let ye Zhuo off?
