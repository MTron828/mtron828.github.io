Chapter 45: Can’t Even Read Chinese Characters

Hearing Lin Xuan say that she was tired, Ye Shuang hurriedly said, “Sure, go, get get some rest! I’ll call you when dinner’s ready.”

Lin Xuan nodded.

“Xuan Xuan, wait a moment.” Yao Cuifen suddenly grabbed Lin Xuan’s hand.

Seeing Yao Cuifen’s hand pressing on hers, Lin Xuan’s eyes revealed a look of disgust. Yao Cuifen was an old woman who didn’t pay much attention to detail. She didn’t even trim her long nails. There was a layer of black dirt hidden under her long nails.

Lin Xuan tried her best to hold back the nauseating feeling that was rising in her heart. “What’s wrong?”

Yao Cuifen continued, “Grandma has something nice for you! Old Man, hurry up and bring it over.”

Ye Dafu immediately walked over with a bag. “This is the amaranth stalk that your grandma specially marinated for you.”

Yao Cuifen continued, “Xuan Xuan, Grandma remembers that this was your favorite when you were young! Only you and Xue Xue get to eat randma’s amaranth stalk. No one else can!”

Lin Xuan and Lin Xue were her two most outstanding granddaughters. Yao Cuifen naturally had to curry favor with them. In the future, when they got married, they would have to be filial to their grandma in return!

“Thank you, Grandma.” Lin Xuan took the bag.

Yao Cuifen smiled and said, “My dear child, there’s no need to be polite with Grandma. Quickly go in and get a good rest.”

Lin Xuan carried the bag into the house. As soon as she entered, she threw the bag in her hand into the trash can.

She felt disgusted by such a dirty thing. She couldn’t stand touching it for a second longer.

Soon after, Sui’s daughter, Zhou Ziyue, also arrived at the house.

Zhou Ziyue was very much like Ye Sui, and was especially good at flattery. One moment, she praised Ye Shuang for getting younger, and the next moment, she praised Ye Shuang for taking good care of her skin. She spewed sweet words one after the other, her mouth looked like it was smeared with honey.

Zhou Ziyue was so good at talking, but when she looked at Ye Zhuo, who was sitting on the sofa like a block of wood, she did not know how to say anything nice.

‘It is one thing for her to be an idiot, but her personality is so unlikable!’

Ye Shuang frowned slightly as a look of disdain appeared in her eyes.

‘Ye Shu should be embarrassed that her daughter turned out this way!’

Ye Shuang took off the bracelet on her hand and put it on Zhou Ziyue’s hand. “Ziyue, this bracelet is for you!”

Zhou Ziyue was flattered. “Aunty, you’re too generous, it’s too much!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Ye Shuang smiled and said, “What’s there to be embarrassed about? You’re my niece, and you’re so sweet. Among all these nieces, you’re the one I like the most. This bracelet was just released this year, and only young people like you look good in it! Aunty is already old!”

Ye Shuang had deliberately put on a show for Ye Zhuo to see.

She assumed that when Ye Zhuo saw that she had given Zhou Ziyue something, this little niece of hers would definitely be envious and jealous. She would then definitely regret that she did not curry favor with her eldest aunt!

Zhou Ziyue held Ye Shuang’s arm as she said. “Aunt, you’re not old at all. You don’t even look like a sister when you stand next to my mother! You guys look more like mother and daughter! If one were to claim to be ‘old’, my mother would be the one!”

Ye Sui glared at Zhou Ziyue unhappily.

Damn girl!

If she wanted to curry favor with Ye Shuang, so be it. Was there a need to drag her, her biological mother, to the ground? Was she that old?

But on account of the bracelet, she let the matter slide.

Ye Shuang was very happy to be flattered by Zhou Ziyue. “You lass, you only know how to make me happy!”

Zhou Ziyue said, “Aunt, you are very young to begin with! Oh right, Aunt, the bracelet you gave me must be very expensive, right? I seem to have heard my classmate mention this brand before.” As she spoke, she glanced at Ye Zhuo.

Mu Yourong had excessively shared information to her about Ye Zhuo’s situation in the Mu family.

She was an idiot!

And top of that, she was not loved by anyone in the family.

As a fake heiress, she had definitely never seen such a good bracelet.

Ye Shuang piped in, “It’s not expensive. It’s only twenty thousand yuan or so.”

Twenty thousand yuan or so?

Zhou Ziyue’s eyes lit up!

This aunt of hers was indeed rich. Twenty thousand yuan was considered a measly amount!

She scanned Ye Zhuo’s entire body. Including her clothes, she would not even amount to twenty thousand yuan. Not to mention twenty thousand, she was probably not even worth two thousand yuan.

Ye Zhuo was not interested in the content of these conversations. She logged into the international website and accepted a mission that could be completed with a cell phone.

After all, she was only interested in making money now!

She had just clicked to accept the mission when the other party sent a message over.

The Pirate Youth typed, ‘F*ck! F*ck! F*ck! You… Are you the great god Niohuru?’

Niohuru.YZ replied, ‘Is there a problem?’

The person on the other end of the screen took off his glasses and wiped his eyes several times seriously. He seemed to be in disbelief that he was so lucky to have the great god Niohuru accept the mission.

As Niohuru.YZ’s fame grew, there were more and more high-level fake accounts who copied the moniker Niohuru.YZ.

He was worried that this was also a high-level fake account.

After looking at it for a long time and confirming that it was the real Niohuru.YZ, the person quickly sent another message, ‘Great God! Please add me as a friend!’

Ye Zhuo was focused on coding and did not see the message.

After a while, she sent the completed task to the other party. “Done. After confirming that there are no problems, please click on the completion button.”

The person on the other end of the screen was stunned.

Niohuru.YZ was truly a god!

A normal person might not even be able to complete that task in a week, but Niohuru.YZ finished it in half an hour.

‘Thank you, God! God you’re amazing!’

As soon as he sent this message, he received the system message that Niohuru.YZ had agreed to add him as a friend.

“F*ck! The God added me as a friend!” The man was jumping from joy and he was so overwhelmed with emotion that he kissed the young woman beside him.

“We’ve arriving at to my house soon. Today is my mother’s birthday, can you act a bit more mature?” The young woman smiled and said, “Which God? Why are you so excited?”

“It’s Niohuru.YZ! The God that our research institute calls a miracle!”

“Really? Let me see!” The young woman, who was also from the research institute, was equally excited.

“Really! Look!”

Soon after, the car stopped, and the driver in the front seat said, “Miss, we’re here.”

The young woman returned the phone to the man. As she got out of the car, she said, “Send me a screenshot of your friend list. I want to post it on my WeChat moments to show off. My circle of friends will definitely die of envy!”

This was great god Niohuru.YZ, a legend in the eyes of the entire research institute!

If she could use this opportunity to form a relationship with Niohuru.YZ, even if it was just a little bit, it would be a great honor.

“Okay.”

After getting out of the car, the young woman helped her boyfriend straighten his tie and then went to ring the doorbell.

The person who opened the door was none other than Ye Shuang.

“Mom!”

“Xue Xue is home!” Ye Shuang was full of smiles. Then, she turned to look at the young man beside Lin Xue.

Lin Xue held onto the young man’s arm as she introduced, “Mom, this is my boyfriend, Zheng Ziheng.”

Zheng Ziheng rubbed his eyes out of habit. “Hello, Auntie. You can just call me Little Zheng.”

Ye Shuang had long known of Zheng Ziheng’s existence. She did not expect the young man to be even more handsome than in the photos. Most importantly, he came from a good family background.

Zheng Ziheng was a rich young master from a wealthy family.

“Little Zheng sounds a little distant, I’ll call you Ziheng. Xue Xue, quickly lead Ziheng into the house! Ziheng, why do you come bearing gifts! Our family does not lack anything, you are not allowed to do this in the future!”

Arriving at the living room, Lin Xue introduced everyone to Zheng Ziheng. When she reached Zhuo Ye, Lin Xue was stunned and at a loss for words.

Ye Shuang said from the side, “Xue Xue, this is your fourth aunt’s biological daughter, Ye Zhuo.”

Hearing this, Lin Xue’s eyes flashed with a mocking look, “Oh, so you’re my cousin, Ye Zhuo! Hi! I’m your cousin, Lin Xue, and this is my boyfriend, Zheng Ziheng.”

Ye Zhuo put down her phone and looked up at Lin Xue, “Nice to meet you, cousin, cousin-in-law.”

The moment Ye Zhuo looked up, Zheng Ziheng was stunned.

His eyes instantly lit up.

He did not expect that Lin Xue would have such a beautiful cousin.

Lin Xue furrowed her brows furiously. As expected of the daughter of a mistress! The daughter of a mistress was born to seduce others!

She held onto Zheng Ziheng’s arm and asked curiously, “I’ve heard Yourong talk about you. She said that you can’t even read Chinese characters. Is this true?”

After saying this, she seemed to sense that her tone was somewhat inappropriate, so she said, “I’m sorry, Cousin Ye Zhuo! I’m just too curious! Our Chinese characters are so complicated, and there are some unfamiliar characters that I’ve never seen before. It’s normal that you can’t recognize them! Not to mention you, there are some unfamiliar characters that I might not even recognize even if I saw them.”

Ye Zhuo smiled slightly and looked down at Xue Lin. “Cousin, you are too modest. I’m just a common person. How can I compare to you?”

Lin Xue could not tell if it was just an illusion or something else, but she could see some coldness and mockery in Ye Zhuo’s eyes.

‘It should be an illusion, right?

‘How could an idiot have that kind of look!’

She was the blessed daughter of wealthy family. In comparison to her, Ye Zhuo was nothing but a pitiful person!

Ye Shuang who was standing by the side said, “Xue Xue, you must be tired from the bus ride. Take Ziheng upstairs to the guest room to rest.”

“Okay.” Lin Xue nodded and brought Zheng Ziheng upstairs.

When they arrived upstairs, Zheng Ziheng asked curiously, “Xue Xue, what’s the background of your cousin? Is today your first time meeting her?”

Lin Xue said casually, “Her? She’s just an illegitimate daughter that my fourth aunt gave birth to! She’s that fake daughter of the Mu family from before. She just recently reconnected with her birth mom.”

Hearing that, Zheng Ziheng’s interest was piqued, “She’s that… fake daughter of the Mu family, Mu Zhuo, who doesn’t know anything?”

Coming from a wealthy family and well connected to other wealthy families, Zheng Ziheng had naturally heard of Ye Zhuo’s history.

Lin Xue nodded, “Yes, it’s her! I heard that the Mu family had to spend money to bribe some people to get her into high school! She was also lucky to have entered the Mu family by accident! If she had stayed by my fourth aunt’s side, she probably wouldn’t have been able to enroll into junior high school!”
