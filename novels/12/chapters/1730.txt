“Seeing the giant being destroyed by the nuclear bomb, the audience in front of the live broadcast also cheered. ”

“Not long after, the smoke dispersed. They thought that they could see the corpse of the giant, but unexpectedly, not only did the giant not die, but it was still standing there! ”

“Director Ma’s expression changed, and he continued, “Fire another nuclear bomb!” ”

“Roger!”

The attack team received the order and immediately fired a nuclear bomb.

One of the mutants rose up in the air and raised its claws. It caught the nuclear bomb and swallowed it!

No one expected the mutants to swallow the nuclear bomb.

“This time, it was dead for sure! ”

“That was a nuclear bomb. Even if the nuclear bomb did not kill it just now, this time, it would definitely explode into pieces. ”

“One second, two seconds, and ten seconds later, the nuclear bomb still didn’t explode. ”

What was going on?

“”Director Ma,”the leader of the attack team turned to look at director Ma and said with sweat all over his head, “The... the nuclear bomb seems to have been... absorbed by the Mutants!” ”

The nuclear bomb was absorbed by the Mutants?

How was that possible!

Director ma immediately took the binoculars and looked at the ground. The mutant that swallowed the nuclear bomb was indeed still standing there!

“Not only was it still standing there, but new xenogeneics were pouring in from all directions. ”

They were densely packed.

It made people panic.

“”Director Ma, should we, should we return first?”The technical team leader continued. ”

“It was not easy to come to Europa, and director Ma was unwilling to return just like that. ”

“But now, what could he do if he was unwilling? ”

Professor Feng was sacrificed!

Tom was also sacrificed.

“Those mutants could still absorb nuclear bombs, so there was no way to land at the moment. They could only go back first and think of a way to defeat these mutants. ” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Director ma nodded. “Let’s return first.”

The technical team leader received this order and heaved a sigh of relief. He immediately arranged for the pilot to return.

Just as the spaceship was about to return —

“Bang!”

The monster on the ground suddenly threw a fireball.

It hit the spaceship!

An alarm sounded from inside the spaceship.

Danger!

Danger!

The spaceship would automatically land on the ground.

The UAV that was hovering in the air and filming was also hit by the fireball thrown by the giant.

Bang!

The UAV directly exploded in the air.

The screen fell into darkness.

The live broadcast was interrupted!

“The situation on this side was witnessed by Dr. Cara, Jamila, and the others. ”

They did not expect Europa to be so dangerous.

Dr. Cara was so anxious that he turned around on the spot.

“However, he could only be anxious. There was nothing he could do. ”

“Europa was too far away from Earth. Without the light-speed aircraft, they could not reach Europa at all. If they could not reach Europa, they could not provide support! ”

“”If I had known earlier, I would not have let Feng Qi and MA jianbang board the spaceship!” ”

Professor Feng and director Ma were the only two people in C country who could crack the light-speed secret.

“Now that Professor Feng was dead, director Ma would most likely not be able to live either! ”

“If the others died, so be it. But if these two people were gone, it also meant that the hope of C country was gone. ”

Regret!

Dr. Cara was very regretful now.

“If he had known that the situation on Europa was as ye Zhuo had predicted, he would not have let Professor Feng and director Ma land on Europa at the same time! ”

“Gamila frowned. “In that case, it’s useless even if you stop them. You should know that landing on Europa is Feng Qi and Ma Jianbang’s lifelong wish!” ”

“Dr. Cara continued, “Call an emergency meeting immediately!” ”

“Yes!”Jamila nodded.

Europa.

“Due to the attack of the giant creature, the spaceship began to fall violently. ”

“What’s going on? What’s going on?”Director Ma’s face was Pale. “Why is the spaceship falling?”

“”Director Ma, those monsters seem to have long-range attacks! The spaceship is badly damaged now, and we can’t go back. We can only land!” ”

“Unable to return, forced to land? ”

What should we do now?

“After all, the ground was full of mutants! ”

“If the spaceship landed at this time, it would be no different from a sheep entering a tiger’s mouth. ”

Boom!

“The next second, the spaceship was forced to land on the ground. ”

We can’t just sit around and wait for death!

“We have to think of a way to fight our way out, then fix the spaceship and return to Earth. ”

“Director ma pressed on the communicator. “Everyone, stay calm! Attack and defense teams, cooperate with each other and fight to the death with these monsters. We will definitely be able to fight our way out of this encirclement!” ”

Fighting their way out of this encirclement and fixing the spaceship was their only hope now!

“Humans were humans, high-level life forms. The mutants outside were only low-level life forms. ”
