Feng Qianhua looked at the inner room. “Take what’s given to you. You’re already so old. Don’t be reluctant to eat and wear. Take this bracelet as a token of my appreciation.”

Aunt Zhang Sighed. “You just gave me a card a while ago.”

“Feng Qianhua patted aunt Zhang’s hand. “That’s for your retirement. This bracelet is for you to keep up appearances. When I marry into the Lin family in the future, your good days will still be ahead!” ”

Aunt Zhang nodded emotionally and wiped away her tears. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“At this moment, Old Lady Lin’s voice came from the inner room. “Qianhua is here?” ”

“Aunt Zhang immediately returned to her normal expression and walked in with a thermal box. “Old Lady, Miss Qianhua is here to bring you soup.” ”

“Aunt Lin.”

Feng Qianhua followed behind and walked in.

“When Old Lady Lin saw Feng Qianhua, she suddenly felt very guilty and felt very sorry for Feng Qianhua. ”

Feng Qianhua had waited for Lin Jin city for nineteen years and served her for nineteen years.

“But until now, she had not fulfilled Feng Qianhua’s wish to marry Lin Jin city. ”

It was also because Feng Qianhua was kind-hearted.

“If it were anyone else, they might not be able to be as filial as Feng Qianhua for more than ten years. ”

Old Mrs. Lin wished that Feng Qianhua would immediately change the way she addressed her.

“As she thought about it, old Mrs. Lin’s eyes became a little moist. ”

“”Aunt Lin, what’s Wrong?” ”

“Old Mrs. Lin said in a raspy voice, “Qianhua, it’s our Lin family that has let you down...” ”

“Feng Qianhua was shocked and quickly took a tissue to wipe old Mrs. Lin’s tears. “Aunt Lin, what are you talking about! When has the Lin family let me down?” ”

“Old Mrs. Lin said, “Qianhua, you’re a good child. I know it all. I know it all! Don’t worry, I’ll definitely think of a way to get you to marry into our Lin family as soon as possible.” ”

Definitely!

“Hearing this, Feng Qianhua blushed. “Aunt Lin, I’m actually very satisfied with the current situation. It’s good to just look at brother Jin Cheng like this. I don’t have to marry him.” ”

Old Madam Lin held Feng Qianhua’s hand tightly. “That won’t do! I Can’t let you wait for nothing for your whole life.”

“Feng Qianhua suddenly sighed. “Speaking of waiting for nothing, Sister Ye Shu has also waited for Brother Jin Cheng for nothing for her whole life. I heard that she’s still alone up until now.” ”

“”Ptui!”At the mention of Ye Shu, Old Madam Lin’s face was filled with disgust. “That promiscuous B * tch, she’s such a Prude! She gave birth to an unknown bastard and still wants to pretend to be affectionate in front of me!” ”

“Every time ye Shu’s name was mentioned, Old Madam Lin would lose control of her emotions. ”

“If it weren’t for that B * Tch Ye Shu, the Ye family wouldn’t have become like this at all. ”

“Feng Qianhua defended ye Shu. “Aunt Lin, don’t talk about sister ye Shu like that. After all, there are many accidents in this world. Perhaps she was forced to destroy that child?” ”

“Old Madam Lin looked at Feng Qianhua, “Qianhua, I know that you’re kind-hearted and don’t want to think so badly of others. But that Fickle B * Tch isn’t worth you defending her! “Back then, I knew that she wasn’t the daughter of a good family just by looking at her vixen face!” ”

Feng Qianhua sighed again. “But sister Ye Shu is Ah Ze’s biological mother after all.”

This was also the only knot in Old Mrs. Lin’s heart that couldn’t be untied.

“Sometimes, Old Mrs. Lin even thought that it would be great if Lin Ze had crawled out from Feng Qianhua’s stomach. ”

Unfortunately...

Things did not go as planned.

“Madam Lin said angrily, “That B * Tch is not qualified to be Ah Ze’s mother! She is not worthy!” ”

“A sinister light flashed across Feng Qianhua’s eyes. It seemed that ye Shu’s affair had left a deep scar in Madam Lin’s heart. “Aunt Lin, don’t be angry. I brought you some health-preserving soup. Let’s Drink the soup first.” ”

“When she heard the words ‘health-preserving soup’, the anger in Old Lady Lin’s heart dissipated a little, and a look of desire appeared in her eyes. ”

It was like walking in the desert and suddenly seeing a pool of spring water.

It was a desire that came from deep within her bones.

...

Yun Jing.

“Although Cen Shaoqing had long prepared everything and had also looked up a lot of tips on confessing on the Internet, he still did not have the confidence to confess ”

He was afraid of being rejected.

Ye Zhuo was so outstanding that he was even more worried that she would look down on him.

“But if he still did not confess, what if song Shi beat him to it? ”

“Moreover, the day of school was getting closer and closer. When Ye Zhuo started school, he was afraid that he would not have so much time left. ”

“Cen Shaoqing held the Buddhist beads in one hand. From the way he looked, it was obvious that he was deep in thought. ”
