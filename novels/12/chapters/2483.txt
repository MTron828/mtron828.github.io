Translator: 549690339

The person song Shiyu didn’t want to hear the most right now was Chen Siyao.

It was also because song Shiyu had some tolerance for doctor Liu.

“Otherwise, doctor Liu definitely wouldn’t have the luck he had today. He wouldn’t have been able to walk out of the study unscathed. ”

“Butler song had been in the song family for a few years, so he knew song Shiyu very well. ”

“Hearing this, doctor Liu frowned slightly and turned to look at the butler. “So you’re just going to watch Miss Liu do nothing?” ”

“”She’s an adult now, so she doesn’t have any special relationship with the song family. Neither the song family nor third master himself has the right to interfere in this matter.”At this point, the butler paused, then he said, “If third master had to intervene in everything that happens in this world, do you think he would be able to handle it?” ”

Doctor Liu was stunned.

“Butler song continued, “Doctor Liu, I advise you not to interfere in this matter.” ”

“I’m a doctor.”Doctor Liu turned to look at Butler song.

What he meant was that he could not sit idly by.

“Butler song smiled and said, “Doctor Liu, it’s up to you to do what you want. I’m just giving you a suggestion.” ”

Doctor Liu did not say anything.

“For the first time, he felt that the song family members weren’t just cold. ”

They were extremely cold.

“What did Miss Chen do wrong?”Doctor Liu couldn’t help but ask.

Song Shiyu wouldn’t treat Chen Siyao like this for no reason.

Butler song looked at Doctor Liu. “This matter can’t be explained in a few words.”

“Seeing that Butler song couldn’t say anything, doctor Liu continued, “Then I’ll go back first. If anything happens to boss song, please inform me immediately.” ”

“Okay.”Butler song nodded.

“Doctor Liu didn’t go back immediately. Instead, he went to Chen Siyao’s place. ”

“Chen Siyao was still lying on the bed. When she heard footsteps, her eyebrows twitched. ”

“The assistant immediately went up to her. “Doctor Liu, you’re back.” ”

Doctor Liu nodded.

“When she heard doctor Liu’s name, Chen Siyao, who was originally in a daze, immediately woke up. She opened her eyes and looked in the direction of the door. ”

“”Miss Chen, I went to boss song’s place.” ”

“He...”Chen Siyao sat up from the bed. “How did he react?”

“Doctor Liu continued, “I told Boss song that your current situation is not good, but he didn’t have any reaction.” ”

“At this point, doctor Liu paused, then he said, “Miss Chen, I don’t know why you went on a hunger strike, but if you want to threaten boss song by going on a hunger strike, I advise you to stop your losses in time. “If you continue like this, you might lose more than you gain.” ”

“Stop your losses immediately?”Chen Siyao’s lips curled up. “Did Shiyu ask you to tell me that?”

The fact that song Shiyu was willing to let doctor Liu tell her that was enough to prove a problem.

“That was, song Shiyu still cared about her. ”

Song Shiyu didn’t want to see anything happen to her.

“Doctor Liu shook his head. “I wanted to tell you this myself, because it’s not worth it for you to do this, and you can’t threaten Boss Song.” ”

“In other words, song Shiyu didn’t care about Chen Siyao at all. ”

“Even if Chen Siyao was really dead, song Shiyu wouldn’t have any special reaction. ”

“It really isn’t him?”Chen Siyao asked.

“”It really isn’t him,”doctor Liu said very seriously. ”

Chen Siyao’s lips curled up. It was obvious that she didn’t believe doctor Liu’s words.

“Doctor Liu took out a glucose and salt water bottle from the medical kit. Then, he took out some medicine and injected it into the bottle. Then, he said, “Miss Chen, I want to hang a bottle of water for you!” ”

“No Need!”Chen Siyao’s face was full of rejection.

“Doctor Liu said helplessly, “Miss Chen, your life is in danger at any moment. I’m not joking with you!” ”

“So What?”Chen Siyao asked.

She was not afraid of death.

She was only afraid that song Shiyu would not see her.

“”Miss Chen!”Doctor Liu looked at Chen Siyao. “I hope that you will be rational. If you do this, you won’t be able to threaten anyone. You will only hurt yourself!” ”

“The closer you are, the faster your enemies will be! ”

“Seeing that doctor Liu was about to force her to get an IV drip, Chen Siyao said angrily, “Little Xu, send the guest out!” ”

“Little Xu walked up awkwardly. “Doctor Liu, please.” ”

“Doctor Liu put down the IV drip and continued, “Miss Chen, please calm down!” ”

“”I’m very calm and clear-headed now,”Chen Siyao continued. “I know exactly what I Need!” ”

It was precisely because she was clear-headed that Chen Siyao was so insistent. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience
