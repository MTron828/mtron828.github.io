“Fan Mu continued, “His guts are even smaller than mine. What would he dare to say?” ”

Man Wen narrowed his eyes and did not say anything else.

“If it was not fan mu or Wen Yang, then there would only be one result. ”

Ye Zhuo knew everything that he had done. She just had not said anything.

At the hospital.

Master Cao was really hospitalized.

He was furious.

He needed to stay in the hospital for three days for observation and recuperation.

“Man Xing stood in front of the floor-to-ceiling window, overlooking the scenery below the hospital. ”

“Compared to just now, she had already calmed down a lot. ”

“”Master, why do you think those people supported man Wen? Is it because of man Wen’s own strength, or is it because of other reasons?”Man Xing looked at Master Cao. ”

“Master Cao narrowed his eyes. “In the past, I always thought that man Wen was just a pile of mud that couldn’t be helped, but now it seems that I was blind.” ”

“A dog that could bite didn’t bark. Not only was Manwen not a dog, he was a wolf! ”

“”Xing ‘er,”master Cao continued, “Master has let you down.” ”

“If he had discovered Manwen’s abnormality in time, things wouldn’t have turned out this way. ”

“”It’s not your fault. If you want to blame someone, Blame Manwen for hiding it too well.”Not only master Cao, even her elder sister had been deceived by Manwen. ”

“It was unknown what he had thought of, but the corners of Manxing’s mouth curled up. “Master, don’t worry. Manwen won’t be able to sit in the position of president for long.” ”

“Master Cao was stunned. “Xing ‘er, do you have a way?” ”

“Manxing narrowed her eyes and asked in return, “Do you think a person who won’t even let his own biological parents off has the qualifications to sit in the position of President?” ”

Filial piety was the first priority.

“No matter what man Jiangshan and Zhao Dan had done, as his son, Man Wen had no right to do anything to them. ”

“Master Cao instantly understood the meaning of the slow sentence. He smiled and said, “Xing ‘er, you are right. Such a person is indeed not qualified to become the president.” ”

“After saying that, master Cao lifted the blanket and sat up from the bed. “Xing ‘er, I have to go back quickly. This matter can not be delayed.” ”

“Man Xing turned around and said, “Master, you should rest well. I will personally take care of this matter.” ”

“There had already been a mistake once. This time, man Xing would not allow any more mistakes. ”

On the other side.

On the aircraft.

“Leo looked at Mr. Feng and asked curiously, “Mr. Feng, there is something that I have been curious about for a long time. Can I ask you?” ”

“”You can ask,”Mr. Feng said. ”

“Leo continued, “What favor does my burning father owe you?” ”

“Although he had been following ye Zao for a long time, Leo really didn’t know about the relationship between ye Zao and Mr. Feng. ” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

He only heard that ye Zao owed Mr. Feng a favor.

Leo was really curious about what kind of favor could make Mr. Feng kneel every time he saw ye Zao.

“Hearing this, Mr. Feng’s expression became distant. ”

“Leo immediately said, “Mr. Feng, if it’s not convenient for you to say it, then forget it. I’m just asking casually.”He was just curious, but it was not necessary for him to know. If this involved the secret of the Feng clan.., that would be bad. ”

“”There’s nothing inconvenient to say.”Mr. Feng smiled and said, “It was about five years ago.” ”

Mr. Feng’s mind was suddenly pulled back to five years ago.

“Five years ago, the Feng family suffered a sudden disaster and was infected with a strange virus. ”

“In the beginning, the virus only caused a slight dizziness and did not affect people’s lives, so people did not pay much attention to it. But later, the virus gradually invaded the nerves, and the infected people began to vomit blood. The worst thing was.., as the virus mutated, it eventually became an infectious phenomenon. Without any special medicine, they could only watch the infected people die. ”

“It became more and more intense. Later, the leader had no choice but to give up on the Feng clan. ”

The entire Feng clan was abandoned on an abandoned asteroid. A total of more than 500 people could only resign themselves to fate.

“During the period when they were abandoned, people died almost every day. ”

“In just ten days, less than half of the original 500 people were left. ”

Dry bones and yellow sand.

It was a tragedy.

“As the clan leader of the Feng clan, Mr. Feng prayed for a miracle almost every day. ”

Unfortunately.

God did not hear his prayers.

“Time passed, and people were still dying. ”

“The virus did not disappear. Instead, it mutated more and more horribly. People who were infected by the virus began to act strangely. There was even cannibalism. ”

Relatives and relatives killed each other.
