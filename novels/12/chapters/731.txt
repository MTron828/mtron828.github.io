“Thinking of this, Lin Jincheng felt a little melancholic. ”

“The few of them walked out of the airport in an imposing manner. This family was all extremely beautiful. Along the way, it was unknown how many people looked back at them. ”

“Walking out of the airport, they saw an extended Lincoln. ”

“Cen Shaoqing and ye Zao sat in a row. On the surface, there didn’t seem to be anything unusual about them, but in fact, their hands had long been intertwined. ”

“Cen Shaoqing tilted his head and looked at Lin Jincheng and Ye Shu. “Uncle and aunt, you must have not eaten yet, right? Why Don’t We Go Eat First?” ”

“”Sure.”Lin Jincheng nodded. “Then I’ll have to trouble you, Little Cen.” ”

“It’s no trouble at all. It’s my pleasure.”Cen Shaoqing did not dare to say that it was troublesome in front of his future father-in-law.

“After a while, the car stopped in front of a high-end member-only restaurant. ”

“It was not until an hour later that the family walked out of the restaurant. The snowy scenery in the capital was very good. This was something that could not be seen in the capital. Therefore, Lin Jincheng suggested that they walk for a while. ”

They could enjoy the scenery while digesting their food.

Ye Shu and Lin Jincheng walked in front.

Cen Shaoqing and ye Zhuo walked in the middle.

Lin Ze walked at the back to prevent CEN Shaoqing from secretly taking advantage of ye Zhuo.

Cen Shaoqing did not even have the courage to hold hands with his brother-in-law. Lin Ze had a very bad impression of him to begin with. He could not leave him with the label of ‘frivolous’and ‘Hooligan’anymore.

“When passing by a flower shop, ye Shu suddenly stopped. Her gaze was attracted by a bunch of flowers. Something seemed to flash past her eyes, but it was so fast that ye Shu almost couldn’t catch it. ”

“What’s Wrong?”Lin Jincheng turned to look at Ye Shu.

“That flower looks pretty good.”

“Following ye Shu’s line of sight, Lin Jincheng saw a bunch of snow-white flowers through the glass window. “Is it that white flower?” ”

“Ye Shu nodded. “Yes, it’s the one that looks like the wind chime.” ”

“Lin Jincheng smiled and said, “That’s the bell orchid. If you like it, I’ll go buy it for you.” ”

Ye Shu was about to say no when Lin Jincheng had already walked towards the direction of the flower shop. A smile appeared at the corner of Ye Shu’s mouth.

“Ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing walked over. “Mom, where did dad go?” ”

“He went to buy flowers.”

“Buy Flowers?”Ye Zhuo was a little puzzled.

“Yes.”Ye Shu nodded.

“The four of them stood where they were and waited for Lin Jincheng. Not long after, Lin Jincheng came trotting back with a bunch of white lilies. “Ah Shu, here you go.” ”

Ye Shu reached out and took the flowers from Lin Jincheng with a smile on her face.

“Lin Jincheng continued, “The boss said that the lilies aren’t blooming right now. This flower was flown back from abroad. Then, I bought you a potted plant of the lilies. He said that it will bloom in May or June.” ”

Ye Shu nodded. “Okay.”

“Ye Shu had never seen the Lily of the valley before, but when she saw the Lily of the valley, she had a very strange feeling. ”

“It was a very familiar feeling, as if she had seen the Lily of the valley somewhere before. However, she fell in love with this kind of pure white flower at first glance. ”

“Ye Zhuo looked at the flower in ye Shu’s hand and found it somewhat familiar. He raised his head to look at Cen Shaoqing and said in a low voice, “Last time when we went to Aunt Lang’s place for a meal, did her small courtyard grow a lot of these flowers?” ”

“Although he had only met Aunt Lang once, Ye Zhuo had a deep impression of this old man. ”

“In order to find his biological daughter, an old man over sixty years of age had waited in the same place for more than thirty years. This kind of spirit was worthy of admiration. ”

“Cen Shaoqing nodded. “Yes, Aunt Lang likes the bell orchid very much.” ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Has there been any news about Aunt Lang’s little half a month?” ”

Cen Shaoqing shook his head slightly. “Not yet.”

Ye Zhuo frowned. “There’s no news at all?”

“Yes.”

“Thinking about Aunt Lang’s gorgeous hair, Ye Zhuo suddenly felt his heart ache. ”

“After waiting for more than thirty years, no one knew how many times Aunt Lang had experienced despair! ”

...

“The next day, Ye Zhuo and an Lizi made an appointment to go shopping together. ”

Ye Zao arrived at the coffee shop on time.

“Big Zao Zao.”

“Seeing ye Zao come in, an Lizi immediately stood up and waved at ye Zao. ”

“Lizi!”

“This was the first time the two of them met after the new year. Ye Zao jogged over and hugged an Lizi. “Lizi, Happy New Year.” ”

“Happy New Year.” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“After sitting down, an Lizi took out a beautifully wrapped box from her bag. “This is a dessert made by my mother. Try It.” ”

“”Thank you.”Ye Zhuo took the dessert with both hands, opened the box and took a bite. He squinted his eyes and said, “It’s very delicious! Auntie’s cooking is really good!” ”
