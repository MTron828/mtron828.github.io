She still managed to charm ye Langhua to death!

“When he heard this, Zhang Peng immediately became anxious and hurriedly said, “Sister Xueyin, don’t! I’m just casually saying it! Don’t worry, I’ll definitely be able to woo Ye Zhuo!” ”

Zhao Xueyin was only then satisfied. “You’ll act according to the circumstances later.”

Zhang Peng nodded.

The two of them returned to the restaurant one after the other. Ye Zhuo had already finished eating and was currently looking at his phone.

“Zhao Xueyin sat in her seat and said with a smile, “Ye Zhuo, you’re still single, right?” ”

Ye Zhuo raised his eyes slightly. “I have a boyfriend.”

A boyfriend? !

Zhao Xueyin was stunned.

“Zhang Peng had already prepared the words, so he could only swallow them silently. ”

“Zhao xueyin smiled and said, “Since you’re so outstanding, your boyfriend must be even more outstanding, right?” ”

Ye Zao picked up the cup and took a sip of coffee. His red lips parted slightly. “Miss Zhao seems to be very interested in my private life?”

Miss Zhao?

Why would ye Zao suddenly call her that?

“Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes. She suddenly had a bad premonition in her heart. She smiled and said, “Ye Zao, do you have some misunderstanding about me?” ”

“Ye Zhuo gently placed the coffee cup on the table and leaned against the back of his chair. He looked at Zhao Xueyin and said faintly, “Zhao Xueyin, female, 26 years old, unmarried. She graduated from Country F’s Ivy League School of Finance. She is the only daughter of Zhao Zhendong of the Shunxi Financial Group and is also one of the executive elders of the Shunxi Financial Group.” ”

“”Tell me, why are you getting close to me?” ”

“Ye Zhuo’s tone was very calm, but not a single word was spoken. His eyes were cold, as if they were coated with a layer of snow, making people not dare to look at him directly. ”

“In fact, the day Zhao Xueyin got close to her, Ye Zhuo already knew that Zhao Xueyin was up to no good. ”

“On one hand, he was too lazy to expose her, and on the other hand, he wanted to see what other tricks Zhao Xueyin had up her sleeve. ”

Zhao Xueyin was stunned.

She did not expect ye Zhuo to say such a thing.

Could it be that ye Zhuo had been acting with her all these days?

“Zhao Xueyin, who had always been high and mighty, was able to dominate everything no matter where she went. For the first time in her life, she was at a disadvantage in front of a girl who was younger and weaker than her. ”

“Zhao Xueyin decided not to pretend anymore, she smiled and said, “As expected of Aunt Lang’s granddaughter. You are smarter than I thought! I am Zhao Xueyin. I have never lied to you, and I have no intention of getting close to you. I just want to be friends with you.” ”

“At this point, Zhao Xueyin paused, looked at ye Zhuo, and continued: ”

“”You’re Aunt Lang’s granddaughter. You’ll definitely take over the position of Old Master Ye in the future, and Old Master Ye and Aunt Lang are the people I admire the most. That’s why I took the liberty to get to know you in such a presumptuous way. I hope you don’t mind.” ”

“Zhao Xueyin’s words were sincere. If it were anyone else, they would definitely be deceived by her beautiful words. ” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

But who was ye Zhuo?

“”Do you mind if we talk about this now since you’ve already done it?”Ye Zhuo picked up the phone on the table. “Miss Zhao, we still have a long way to go! See You at the Shunxi Financial Group.” ”

“After saying this, Ye Zhuo turned around and left. His back view was extremely dashing. ”

Zhao Xueyin looked at ye Zhuo’s back view and frowned. She picked up the cup on the table and threw it on the ground.

Crack!

The Coffee Cup was smashed into pieces.

“At this moment, ye Zhuo suddenly looked back and met Zhao Xueyin’s angry eyes. He smiled and opened his red lips. “I forgot to thank Miss Zhao for your hospitality. The free lunch is indeed delicious!” ”

“Under the bright crystal lights, she just stood there. Her lips were red and her teeth were white. Her eyes were like a painting. ”

Her appearance was so infuriating.

“Zhao Xueyin was so angry that her whole body was trembling, but she had no choice but to control her emotions. ”

Damn it!

This damn ye Zhuo!

“For the first time in her life, she, Zhao Xueyin, was actually fooled by a little girl! ”

Meet with the Shunxi Financial Group?

“How confident ye Zhuo was today, she would make ye Zhuo regret it in the future! ”

Zhao Xueyin held her anger in her heart and felt extremely uncomfortable.

“At this moment, a waiter from the restaurant jogged over. “Customer, May I help you?” ”

“”No Need!”Zhao Xueyin continued, “The bill.” ”

“Please follow me over here.”

“Zhang Peng said, “Sister Xueyin, let me settle the bill.” ”

“No need.”Zhao Xueyin followed the waiter to the cashier counter.

“The waiter continued, “Including the Broken Cup, it’s a total of 1,080 yuan.” ”

Zhao Xueyin took out a gold card. “Swipe it.”

“”Okay, please wait a moment.”The cashier took the gold card with both hands. ”
