“Awoo –“the ferocious Tibetan Mastiff turned into a cute kitten in front of Ye Zao.

“Although ye Zao came once every half a month, the small animals here already knew her. ”

…

“Three days later, Zhao Zhenfei was transferred to the Supreme People’s court. ”

“In the first instance, Zhao Zhenfei was sentenced to death and his personal property was confiscated. ”

Zhao Xueyin watched helplessly as the villa was affixed with a seal.

“Fortunately, she still had a private bank card. ”

The money in the card could allow her to rent a house.

“However, she could only rent a very ordinary residential house. ”

Zhao Xueyin was unwilling.

She was truly unwilling.

“She never thought that one day, her life would become like this. ”

The lawyer.

“Yes, and the lawyer. ”

“At this moment, Zhao Xueyin suddenly thought of the lawyer. ”

Although the lawyer had said many ruthless words to her.

But the lawyer loved her so much.

“Now that she had become like this, the lawyer definitely would not ignore it. ”

She had to think of a way to get the lawyer to save her.

Although her face had been destroyed.

“But she believed that the lawyer loved her, not her face. ”

The lawyer had never been a person who looked at faces.

As long as she went back.

The lawyer would definitely treat her like a treasure in his hands.

Zhao Xueyin came to the Jin Financial Group.

“At present, the lawyer had officially become the head of the difficult financial group. ”

It was also a coincidence.

Zhao Xueyin had just arrived at the entrance of the Jin Financial Group when she saw the lawyer walking out from inside.

“He was wearing a handmade suit that had been ironed neatly. His hair was meticulously combed to the back of his head. He looked handsome and cool, as if his entire person was glowing. ”

This was the lawyer.

The lawyer who had once loved her to the bone.

“Big Brother Si.”Zhao Xueyin rushed over.

“She thought that she could directly hug the lawyer, but she didn’t expect to be stopped by two security guards. ”

The lawyer didn’t even look at Zhao Xueyin and directly walked into the car.

He was ruthless to the extreme.

“Let her go.”

“At this moment, a pleasant voice appeared in the air. ”

Zhao Xueyin looked up and saw a hateful face.

“This was… the Ming family’s eldest miss, Ming Yao. ”

“Ming Yao looked at Zhao Xueyin. “Miss Zhao, I haven’t seen you for a long time. You almost made me unable to recognize you. I gave you face. You and my fiancé are already in the past. It Won’t be nice if this pestering spreads, right?” ”

Fiancé?

How could it be!

How could the lawyer betray her and get engaged to another woman?

No!

It was impossible.

“”What did you say?”Zhao Xueyin roared, “What nonsense are you talking about! Why would lawyer Si get engaged to someone like you?” ”

“Ming Yao continued, “It seems like you still don’t know. Three days ago, I held an engagement party with Jin Ruyu, who is lawyer Si. He is now my fiancé. “Miss Zhao, everyone knows their own limits. If I find out that you are pestering my fiancé again, don’t blame me for being rude.” ”Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Ming Yao continued, “You looked down on my fiancé back then. Now, it’s your retribution. If I Were you, I wouldn’t have the face to beg him again!” ”

“After saying that, Ming Yao turned around and walked into the car. ”

Zhao Xueyin quickly chased after her. “Big Brother Si! Big Brother Si! I love you. I really love you. Can you not get engaged to this woman?”

Regret.

Zhao Xueyin’s intestines were turning green with regret.

“If she had not made the wrong choice back then, she would be the one standing beside Si lui now. ”

She would also be the one who was bright and beautiful.

Ming Yao was nothing?

She was just a clown.

But now.

The clown had become her.

Ridiculous.

It was simply ridiculous.

Zhao Xueyin fell to the ground.

She knew.

“From now on, the lawyer could only be a passer-by in her life. ”

“Ming Yao sat in the car and looked at the lawyer. “If you regret it now, it’s still not too late. From the looks of it, she is indeed quite miserable.” ”

“If she was not in a desperate situation, Zhao Xueyin would definitely not appear in front of the lawyer in such a manner. ”

“I am your fiancé now.”There was no emotion in the lawyer’s voice.

“”In that case, you don’t regret it?”Ming Yao raised her eyebrows, then, she said, “I dare to guarantee that if you forgive Zhao Xueyin now, Zhao Xueyin will definitely not betray you in the future. “If you’re worried that it’s hard to explain to the parents of both sides, you don’t have to worry about that at all. Just leave it to me.” ”

Ming Yao had never liked to force people to do things that they didn’t want to do.

“Moreover, the relationship between her and Si lui was originally a transaction. ”

“The lawyer lit a cigarette and said, “I told you, the only thing I have left for Zhao Xueyin is disgust.” ”

“Moreover, it was the kind of disgust. ”
