“Hearing this, the old man chimed in, “Elder sister, this is your fault. The child doesn’t have the conditions to let you stay in the VIP ward. You should understand. How can you throw a Tantrum?” ”

“Old Lady Lin tried her best to open her mouth, wanting to say everything. ”

But she couldn’t say a single word.

“The old man looked at Feng Xianxian again. “Xianxian, Where’s your father? Your Grandmother is sick. Why aren’t your parents coming over to take a look?” ”

“Feng Xianxian said hesitantly, “I’m not related to my grandmother by blood. My uncle doesn’t recognize my grandmother anymore. I called them last night, but they didn’t pick up either...” ”

“Hearing this, the old man looked at Feng Xianxian in surprise. He didn’t expect that Feng Xianxian and Old Lady Lin weren’t related by blood. ”

Feng Xianxian was really too kind. She could actually treat a person who wasn’t related to her by blood so well.

“If it were anyone else, who could do what Feng Xianxian did? ”

“Feng Xianxian continued, “Although I’m not related by blood to Grandma, Grandma has treated me like her own granddaughter since she was young. Now that he’s old, it’s only right for me to treat her better.” ”

Only old madam Lin knew that Feng Xianxian was putting on an act.

Everyone had been deceived by Feng Xianxian.

No!

No!

She could not let Feng Xianxian succeed just like that.

She wanted to live on.

She wanted to live on well.

She wanted to see Feng Xianxian’s retribution with her own eyes.

“Thinking of this, Old Madam Lin opened her mouth. ”

“Feng Xianxian immediately fed Old Madam Lin a spoonful of preserved egg and lean meat porridge, breaking her tears into a smile. “Grandmother, it’s good that you have thought it through.” ”

The next second.

Old Lady Lin wanted nothing more than to immediately spit out the preserved egg and lean meat porridge in her mouth.

This preserved egg and lean meat porridge was not a normal bowl of preserved egg and lean meat porridge at all.

It was so salty!

It was intentional.

Feng Xianxian did it on purpose!

She wanted to slowly torture herself to death like this.

“But now, apart from glaring at Feng Xianxian, Old Lady Lin could do nothing else. ”

“After taking the first bite, Old Lady Lin refused to open her mouth to take a second bite. ”

“Feng Qianxian said with some doubt, “Grandma, Why aren’t you eating? is the porridge not to your liking? Why don’t I Go and buy you a new one?” ”

“The old man next door took a bite of the preserved egg lean meat porridge and said with a smile, “This preserved egg lean meat porridge is delicious! Qianxian, you don’t have much money to begin with, so don’t waste it! Your Grandma is not eating, so maybe she is not hungry?” ”

“Feng Xianxian sighed, her eyes filled with sadness. “Maybe grandmother is still blaming me! If I had found out earlier that grandmother had fallen, she wouldn’t be like this! It’s My Fault, it’s All My Fault!” ”

“”No, child, it’s not your fault,”the old man comforted Feng Xianxian. ”

He was very dissatisfied with Old Lady Lin.

“Feng Xianxian was not her biological granddaughter, so it was already very rare for her to be so good to her. ”

“It was fine if Old Lady Lin did not appreciate her kindness, but now it was Feng Xianxian’s fault! ”

“At night, Feng Xianxian fed old lady lin salty noodles again. ”

“Old Lady Lin did not eat much throughout the day. At noon, Feng Xianxian fed her salty thin meat porridge. At this time, she was so thirsty that her throat was almost smoking. She only wanted to drink a cup of water, how could she still eat noodles? ”

“But now, even if she couldn’t eat, she had to grit her teeth and eat it. ”

She had to live well.

She had to live to see Feng Xianxian suffer!

...

A week later.

Old Mrs. Lin was officially discharged from the hospital.

“Old Mrs. Lin sat in her wheelchair, looking at the long-lost sunshine. There was no expression in her eyes. ”

These ten days.

“Feng Xianxian fed her salty food at every meal, and only gave her half a cup of water every day... ”

She didn’t even know how she survived.

But she told herself.

She had to endure it!

Only by enduring it could she see Hope.

Feng Xianxian pushed Old Lady Lin in the direction of the LIN Group.

“Now, Old Lady Lin had already put her fingerprint on the share rights. From now on, she was the real owner of the LIN Group. ”

“She had already discussed with the five shareholders who had previously withdrawn their capital from the LIN Group. After she officially took over the Lin Group, she would let these five shareholders re-acquire their shares! ”

“Now, these five shareholders had already arranged a press conference in the LIN Group. ”

She wanted to push Old Lady Lin to publicly announce that she was the real successor of the Lin Group!

“Very quickly, Feng Xianxian pushed Old Lady Lin to the Lin Group’s headquarters. ”

At this moment.

Many reporters had gathered below the LIN Group’s building.

“When they saw Feng Xianxian pushing Old Lady Lin over, reporters immediately trotted over, “Miss Feng, there are rumors that Old Lady Lin left all the shares of the LIN Group to you and even left a suicide note. Is this news true?” ”
