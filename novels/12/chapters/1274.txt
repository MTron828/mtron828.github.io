“Captain Li’s expression was a little complicated. At first, he had thought that ye Zhuozhu was very powerful. “Maybe it’s just a show.” ”

“I don’t think so. Look at how fast she’s moving!”That person looked at ye Zhuozhu without a hint of doubt in his eyes.

“Captain Li continued, “Those who know how to watch watch watch the door, and those who don’t know how to watch the show. I heard from Xu Yao that she’s not restoring the surveillance at all.” ”

“”Ah?”Old Merchant said with a disappointed look, “Then what about the portrait of our group!” ”

“Captain Li said, “Let’s Wait a little longer! Xu Yao said that she has a very powerful senior and should be arriving soon.” ”

“That’s Good!”Old merchant nodded.

“Xu Yao couldn’t be bothered to waste any more time at ye Zhuo’s place, she continued, “Miss Ye, there’s something that I have to go out for a while. If there’s anything you need, you can just tell them.”. “Oh right, Miss Ye, there are two very important files in the folder on the table. You have to be careful. My computer has been specially set up. If I accidentally delete the files, I won’t be able to get them back.” ”

“En.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“After saying that, Xu Yao looked at the man beside her and said in a low voice, “There are many important confidential files in my computer. Help me keep an eye on them. Don’t let her accidentally delete those files!” ”

“Don’t worry.”The man nodded.

“Sorry to trouble you. I’ll be back soon.”

“Okay.”

Xu Yao turned around and walked out.

“In the end, she had only taken a few steps when she heard a series of exclamations behind her. ”

“Oh my God!”

“Holy shit!”

Xu Yao’s face turned pale. Could it be that those documents of hers had been accidentally deleted by Ye Zhuo?

What should she do?

Those were all confidential documents!

Xu Yao quickly turned around and walked over in quick steps. “Miss Ye! I’ve already told you that those two folders can not be touched. Why did you...”

“As she spoke, Xu Yao was stunned. ”

What did she see?

The surveillance video that was originally stuck at 8:23 am was actually playing bit by bit at this moment.

The restoration was successful!

Ye Zao actually succeeded in restoring it!

This was too unbelievable.

How did ye Zao do it?

“”It’s only been 20 minutes, and our entire technology department has been restoring it for more than a day, but we still haven’t been able to restore it successfully. Miss Ye, aren’t you too amazing?” ”

“Shameless!”

“”Miss Ye, are you considering taking in a disciple?” ”

“...”

“Those who could stay in the technology department were all extremely talented students. Any one of these people, when taken outside, would be a talent that could only be met by chance but not sought. ”

But today.

These talents were all convinced by ye Zao!

There were even people who begged ye Zao to take them in as disciples.

“Hearing these words, Xu Yao’s face turned pale. ”

How could it not be pale?

“Just ten minutes ago, she was still calling ye Zao a flower in front of Captain Li. In the blink of an eye, Ye Zao had ruthlessly slapped her in the face. ”

Ye Zao was just a waste in the Yun capital in the past.

When did she become so amazing?

Xu Yao almost lost her balance.

“Ye Zao looked back slightly. “Captain Li, the surveillance camera has been successfully restored.” ”

It was successfully restored?

Captain Li widened his eyes in surprise.

“Although he did not understand computers, he knew how difficult it was to restore the surveillance camera. ”

There were dozens of people in the entire technology department.

They had studied it for more than a day.

But they still couldn’t restore it.

Ye Zao had successfully restored the surveillance cameras without even warming up his stool.

What kind of strength was this?

“Moreover, didn’t Xu Yao just say that ye Zao was just a Flower? ”

This was called a flower?

“If this was called a flower, then what was his name? ” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Trash?

Captain Li swallowed his throat.

“Before captain Li could react, ye Zao continued, “Is there anything else I can help you with? If there isn’t, I’ll leave first.” ”

“”Yes! Yes! Yes!”Old merchant reacted immediately and continued, “Miss Ye, my surname is Jia, Jia Baoyu’s Jia. I would like to ask you to help our group restore a portrait. Is that okay with you?” ”

“Although ye Zhuo was young, old merchant unconsciously used the honorific ‘you’during the conversation. ”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“This Way Please!”Old merchant immediately made a ‘please’gesture.

Ye Zhuo followed old merchant’s footsteps.

“After a short while, he followed old merchant to group a next door. ”

This was a murder and body disposal case

A photo left behind at the scene became the key to solving the case.

Unfortunately.

This photo had been blistered and couldn’t be seen clearly. It was colorful.

“Hearing that a computer expert had come, old merchant could not wait to rush over. ”

“Old merchant handed the photo to Ye Zhuo. “Miss Ye, do you think this photo is still possible to be restored?” ”
