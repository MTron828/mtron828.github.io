“CEN Shaoqing said, “Maybe it’s because his physical fitness is good.” ”

“After a short while, the dishes were served. ”

Everyone began to put all kinds of ingredients into the boiling pot.

“However, Ye Zhuo was mainly responsible for eating. ”

“Perhaps it was because there was a lack of food in her previous life, and people relied on nutrient fluids to maintain their lives, so she enjoyed the process of eating very much. Every time she ate, she was even more serious than when she was doing scientific research. ”

Cen Shaoqing seemed to be able to read her mind. He cooked everything that she wanted to eat in advance and brought it to her.

“With a glance, Cen Shaoqing knew whether she wanted to drink water or tissues. ”

Zhao Pingting and an Lizi were extremely envious. They wanted to find a boyfriend immediately and have a passionate relationship.

An Lizi also secretly took a photo of Cen Shaoqing feeding ye Zao Meat.

The capture was very good.

“From the looks of it, it gave off a strong feeling of a domineering CEO and a petite wife. ”

“Cen Shaoqing looked up at an Lizi. “Cousin, aren’t you guys going to eat?” ”

“We’re full.”They were full from eating dog food.

Cen Shaoqing did not ask any more questions and continued to cook for ye Zao.

“He ziteng looked at an Lizi and asked uncertainly, “What did my fifth brother call you just now?” ”

Did he hear correctly?

“”Cousin,”an Lizi answered. ”

Cousin?

It was really cousin!

He ziteng swallowed his throat.

He thought he had a problem with his hearing.

“An Lizi knew what he ziteng was thinking. She whispered, “What’s the big deal about calling him cousin? He even called Ping Tingting!” ”

“Really?”He ziteng couldn’t put on any expression.

“Cen Shaoqing was a man of few words. He did not even bother to call his four sisters, let alone the others. ”

“An lizi smiled and said, “Of course it’s true.” ”

“He ziteng touched his chin and continued, “That girl, do you have a boyfriend?” ”

“What do you want?”An Lizi looked at he ziteng.

“He ziteng said, “If you don’t have a boyfriend, do you want to consider me? Coincidentally, I don’t have a girlfriend either!” ”

It didn’t matter whether he found a girlfriend or not. He ziteng mainly wanted to hear Cen Shaoqing call him brother-in-law.

Brother-in-law!

“When he thought that Cen Shaoqing was going to call him brother-in-law, he ziteng felt like he was going to float. ”

An Lizi looked at he ziteng and felt that there must be something wrong with this person’s brain. How could a normal person talk about such a topic when they just met?

“”I’m sorry. I like people like my younger brother, Millennium.” ”

“He ziteng felt that an Lizi was joking. “Sister, don’t be like this. I’m serious.” ”

“I’m also very serious.”

He ziteng rubbed his chin.

No Way.

He had to chase after an Lizi.

He asked Cen Shaoqing to call him brother-in-law.

“After dinner, it was past seven. He ziteng said, “Fifth sister-in-law, there’s a new movie screening today. Let’s go watch it?” ”

Ye Zhuo turned to look at an Lizi and Zhao Pingting. “Do you two want to go?”

“Sure.”An Lizi nodded. “It just so happens that Pingting and I are also discussing whether or not we want to watch the movie.”

“Cen Shaoqing held his phone and said, “I’ll book the tickets.” ”

“He ziteng smiled and said, “Fifth brother, there’s no need to book. I’ve already booked it.”He would never let go of such a good opportunity to perform! ”

The few of them arrived at the cinema.

“Although it was snowing outside, there were quite a number of people in the cinema. ”

“When he ziteng booked the tickets, he specially reserved the seats for the five of them separately. ”

“Ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing sat in the front row while he, an Lizi and Zhao Pingting sat in the back row. ”

Cen Shaoqing was very satisfied with he ziteng’s arrangement. He turned around and glanced at he ziteng. He ziteng made an ‘ok’gesture to CEN Shaoqing.

The movie started very soon. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“This was a high-explosive sci-fi movie, but ye Zhuo was not interested in it. After all, the scenes in the movie were nothing compared to her experience in her previous life. ”

“In addition to the fact that she did not sleep well last night, it did not take long for ye Zhuo to fall asleep. ”

“Cen Shaoqing lowered her eyebrows and carefully pressed her head on her shoulder. Then, she covered her body with her coat. The entire process was maintained in one position. She did not even dare to move, he was afraid that he would accidentally wake her up. ”

Ye Zhuo slept very contentedly until the end of the movie. Only then did she open her eyes.

“You’re Awake?”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo pinched the bridge of his nose. Only then did he realize that he was wearing Cen Shaoqing’s coat. “Aren’t you cold?”

“”No.”Cen Shaoqing’s tone was low, and his cold voice was a little hoarse. ”

Ye Zhuo frowned slightly and immediately took off his clothes and draped them over him. “You still say you’re not cold? Your voice is hoarse.”
