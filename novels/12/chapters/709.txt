“Luo Luo said with a proud face, “Aunt, I can even eat three gold ingots! Why did you only eat one?” ”

“Ye Zao was a little surprised. “Luo Luo, are you that good?” ”

“Of course!”

Duan Duan was a little unconvinced. “Eating three is nothing. My Daddi can still eat five!”

“My Daddi can eat ten!”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Alright, Alright. All of you, stop arguing and quickly go eat.” ”

Only then did the five little ones stop the war and follow ye Zhuo to the dining hall.

Almost all of the Lin family members had woken up.

“At this moment, the dining hall was filled with people. ”

Breakfast was noodles and eggs.

“Just after breakfast, there was a knock on the door. ”

Ye Zao walked over to open the door.

“As soon as he opened the door, he saw Cen Shaoqing covered in snow. ”

“The snowflakes outside were very big. At this moment, Cen Shaoqing’s head and clothes were covered in snow. ”

“”Happy New Year, leader.” ”

“Happy New Year.”

“Cen Shaoqing was just about to step into the door when ye Zao said, “Wait a moment.” ”

“What’s Wrong?”

Ye Zao stood on Tiptoe and patted the snow off Cen Shaoqing’s hair.

“After patting away all the snowflakes, ye Zao brought Cen Shaoqing in. ”

“In the entire ye family, Cen Shaoqing had the lowest seniority, apart from the five little guys. ”

“He was originally a serious person. No matter where he went, he was always flattered by others. However, when he arrived at the Lin family, he still had to take the initiative to greet the New Year. “Happy New Year, Uncle Lin.” ”

“”Happy New Year, Uncle.” ”

“”Happy New Year, Uncle.” ”

“”Happy New Year, second uncle...” ”

“After greeting uncle and aunt, there were ten older brothers and nine older cousins. ”

“If this was in the past, the Lin family would definitely not be used to it. ”

“After all, this person was Cen Shaoqing. ”

“But now, the Lin family was already used to it. ”

“Ye Sen lay on the sofa and played on his phone. After playing a game, he looked up at Ye Zao. “Zao Zao, when are we returning to Yun Jing?” ”

“Ye Zao said, “The sixth day of the first lunar month.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Sen continued to play on his phone.

“After paying their new year’s greetings, Ye Zao and Cen Shaoqing went to the Cen family home. ”

The CEN sisters were all gathered today.

“At this moment, the family was sitting in the living room chatting. When they saw Cen Shaoqing bringing ye Zao over, the sisters were overjoyed. “Zao Zao is Here!” ”

“”Zao Zao, is it cold outside?” ”

The sisters forcefully pushed Old Lady Cen to the side.

Not to mention Old Lady Cen.

Even Cen Shaoqing was pushed far away.

“Although Cen Yuyan was a little unhappy, she did not show it. ”

She did not understand.

What was so good about ye Zao?

It was worth for the three sisters to like her so much.

Could it be that Old Lady Cen was blind and the three sisters were blind as well?

“Cen Yueying took out a red packet and handed it to ye Zao. “Zao Zao, this is the new year’s money!” ”

“Cen Yueya was not willing to be outdone and took out an even thicker red packet. “Zao Zao, this is a little gift from second sister.” ”

“Cen yuying smiled and said, “And me.” ”

The red packets that these three sisters took out were each bigger than the other.

Only Cen Yuyan did not take it.

Old Mrs. Cen looked at Cen Yuyan unhappily.

She felt that Cen Yuyan didn’t do it honorably.

Old Mrs. Cen quietly stuffed her red packet to CEN Yuyan.

“”Grandma, what are you doing?”Cen Yuyan looked at Old Mrs. Cen. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen was holding her anger in her heart and gritted her teeth. “Take it to Yezi.”Thinking of her illustrious reputation, she even helped Cen Shaoqing find such an outstanding daughter-in-law. How could she have such a granddaughter? ”

“Cen Yuyan finally reacted. She had to put on a show. She took the red packet from old Mrs. Cen and walked to Ye Zao. “Zao Zao, this is fourth sister’s token of appreciation.” ”

“”Thank you, fourth sister.” ”

“Cen Yuyan smiled and said, “You’re welcome. We’re all family.” ”

Cen Yuyan’s lowered eyes were filled with sarcasm

Family?

She wanted to see how many more days Cen Shaoqing could endure ye Zao.

Just wait. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Cen Shaoqing would break up with ye Zao sooner or later.

“After CEN Yuyan received the red packet, CEN could only go back to her room to prepare the red packet again. She specifically held Zhou Xiang back and did not give the red packet to ye Zao for the time being. She waited for her to take it as well. ”

“Otherwise, it would be too awkward for her to give the red packet to ye Zao alone. ”

“Cen Yueying pulled ye Zao and sat down on the sofa. “Zao Zao, this is your favorite pineapple!” ”

“”Thank you, third sister.”Ye Zao reached out and took the pineapple. ”

“Is it sweet?”Cen Yueying asked.

“Very sweet.”Ye Zao nodded.

“Cen yueying smiled and said, “I know you like to eat pineapple. This pineapple was personally picked by our fifth girl at the supermarket yesterday morning.” ”
