“Chapter 1639: 333: successfully landing on Neptune, a slap in the face! 7”

“The advantage was that they could use the resources of the various planets to promote the development of science and Technology. The disadvantage was that they were overexploited, resulting in the overexploitation of a few planets closer to the Solar System. People had no choice but to go further away in search of new sources of energy, however, the further away they were from the Solar System, the greater the danger. In the universe, no one knew what would happen in the next second! ”

“Therefore, it was common for aircraft to go missing. ”

“Chen Hao looked at ye Zao and suddenly laughed. “Father Zao, you look so serious. I’m taking you seriously!” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and continued, “In short, pay attention to your safety. If you find anything wrong, contact me immediately.” ”

“”Okay.”Chen Hao nodded. “Don’t worry, Father Zao!” ”

“Tang mi continued, “Miss Ye, is Neptune really that scary?” ”

“Ye Zao said, “The pressure on Neptune is about five times that on Earth. At the same time, the temperature is still very low, close to minus 200 degrees Celsius! The visibility is also very low. However, you don’t have to worry about that. As long as you put on the spacesuits, these will not be a problem. The most important thing for you to pay attention to is that when you collect the samples, don’t be hit by the diamonds that fall from the sky! “At the bottom of the water ice cloud layer, there are more than 10,000 atmospheric pressures. Your movements may not be as light as they are now. You must pay attention to the time. If you miss the time of the anti-ship, you may have to stay on Neptune Forever!” ”

Tang mi nodded very seriously.

Ye Zao repeated many questions.

“Cen Jiang walked to the outside of the aircraft carrier and picked up the camera, he then said, “We have arrived at Neptune. We are now heading towards the interior of Neptune. “Although Neptune is a gaseous planet, the surface mass of the core of Neptune is similar to that of Earth. It is a solid land made of a large number of rocks and ice crystals. The ground is filled with diamonds. After we reach Neptune, we will activate the aircraft carrier’s collection system. In six hours, you will be able to see the diamonds that have returned from Neptune!” ”

“As they spoke, the aircraft carrier had already stopped on the land of Neptune. ”

“Just as Cen Jiang had said, there were sparkling diamonds everywhere, and it was raining diamonds outside! ”

“Cen Jiang raised the camera. “Look, this is Neptune!” ” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Ye Zhuo and Dr. Warne took out the national flag from the cabin.

They saw the national flag.

Everyone’s emotions were ignited once again. They stood up from their seats and listened to the national anthem coming from the distant Neptune.

Ye Zhuo and Dr. Warne planted the national flag on the ice crystal not far from the landing point.

The bright red national flag fluttered in the wind.

“At this moment, the big screen suddenly turned black. ”

“At the same time, a miserable cry came from the other side: ”

Ah!

The image coming from Neptune came to an abrupt stop.

“Team leader Cen! Team leader Cen!”Feiyu team member Sun Tian asked anxiously.

“However, there was no response from the other side. ”

“Miss Ye! Dr. Warne!”Dr. Millet turned on the emergency communication device.

There was still no response.

“Seeing this scene, everyone’s hearts were in a mess. ”

On the other side was the distant planet Neptune.

“Without a light-speed aircraft, it would take at least two hundred years to fly to Neptune. ”

What should they do now?

The live bullet screen:

[ where’s Miss Ye? ]

[ did something happen? ]

“[ maybe this is what happens when people go crazy! YC relied on luck to create an aircraft carrier that exceeds the speed of light, but they didn’t expect the dangers on Neptune! ] ”

[ how do we calculate this bet? Did We lose or did China Lose? ]

“[ nonsense! Of course it was China! The bet bet was that YC had to create an aircraft carrier that could land on Neptune faster than the speed of light. Now, what about the aircraft carrier? ] ”

“Retribution!”

“At the scene, Dr. Cara, Camilla, Tina, and the other international doctors looked at each other and saw satisfaction in each other’s eyes. ”

The light-speed aircraft carrier crashed on Neptune.

China had lost the gamble in the end!

“Now, they just had to wait for six hours. ”

At the same time.

Xiao Qing fainted when he saw the connection between the aircraft carrier and the surface was cut off.

“Tang Mi was her only daughter. Now that Tang Mi was in trouble, not even a corpse could be seen. As a mother, how could she not be anxious and sad? ”

The atmosphere at the Lin family’s side was also very tense.

“Lin Ze kept comforting his parents. “Dad, Mom, don’t worry. Searing will be fine. They only temporarily lost contact with the surface.” ”

“Zhongrao!”Ye Shu lay on Lin Jincheng’s body and cried loudly.

“Lin Jincheng was also very anxious, but he could not cry. Ye Shu was already like this. As the head of the family, if he were to cry, it would really be over! ”

Shengdong express delivery.

“But the moment he saw that the aircraft carrier lost contact with the ground, Ye Sen was stunned. His face was pale. Then, he directly knelt on the ground and put his hands together, “I beg Buddha to bless me and bless my niece, Ye Zao, to return safely. If she can return safely, I am willing to reduce my lifespan by 10 years, 20 years, 30 years!” ”

Time passed by minute by minute.

“In the blink of an eye, six hours had passed. ”

“During this period, there was no news from the aircraft carrier. Countless people were praying for ye Zao. ”

They hoped that a miracle would happen.

“Dr. Cara stood up from his chair and looked at Cen Shaoqing. “CEN fifth master, it’s time. You can announce the results now.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing’s tone was indifferent, “The betting agreement said that the launch ceremony will be held on May 18th. As long as it’s not past 12 o’clock at night, today will still be may 18th. As long as today is may 18th, the agreement will not exceed the time limit. Since it didn’t exceed the time limit, Dr. Cara, why are you in such a hurry?” ”

“”Do you mean that you still want us to waste seven hours here with you?”Jamila stood up from the chair, “Fifth Master Cen, the time of each of us is very precious. It is already a foregone conclusion. Let alone seven hours, even if we give you seven years, you can not change anything!” ”

“”It is written in black and white. Don’t tell me that fifth master Cen wants to renege on his debt?”Dr. Cara directly took out the betting agreement. “I know that you are the one who founded the CEN base. You are very reluctant to part with it. However, there is a saying in your country that only a man who is willing to part with something will have something to gain. “A loss is a loss. Even if you don’t want to admit it, it still lost!” ”

“He ziteng stood up from his chair. “What do you mean? Who said we lost? Have we passed the 18th? As long as we haven’t passed the 18th, we haven’t lost!” ”

“Dr. Tina continued, “We just feel that there’s no point in wasting time like this! A loss is a loss!” ”

The comments on the bullet screen were almost flooded by the C Nation People: [ Chinese people are Shameless! ]

[ is it that difficult for Chinese people to admit defeat? Is it interesting to waste another seven hours? ]

“[ from the beginning, I knew that China would definitely act shamelessly. They are too shameless. They didn’t even admit defeat. ] ”

“At this moment, a bright light shot down from the sky. ”

“The sudden bright light made it hard for people to open their eyes. Then, the flying object of the huge object appeared in the sky. ”

“Following that, there were cries of surprise and cheers — ”

“Look! It’s Miss Ye Who’s Back!”

“Aircraft carrier! It’s our aircraft carrier!”
