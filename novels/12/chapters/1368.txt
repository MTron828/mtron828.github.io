“Xie wanqiu was constantly thinking about Zhou Xiang, but what about Zhou Xiang? ”

How did Zhou Xiang Treat Xie Wanqiu?

Kindness was like the liver of a donkey!

“Thinking about Zhou Xiang’s words and actions in the CEN family, Zhou Zuolong was very angry. ”

How could there be a daughter like Zhou Xiang in the world?

“Zhou zuolong said, “That ingrate. You care about her more than you care about a dog. You care about a dog, and a dog can even wag its tail at you. What would she do?” ”

“Xie wanqiu smiled and patted Zhou Zuolong’s hand. “Old Man, look at how you talk! It’s been so many years, but your bad temper hasn’t changed at all! Xiangxiang is your daughter. If you say that she’s an ingrate, then what are you?” ”

“Yu Luo, Xie wanqiu sighed, then she said, “As the saying goes, it’s the fault of the father if the son doesn’t teach. “It’s the fault of the mother if the daughter doesn’t teach. As Xiangxiang has become like this, as a mother, I’m also responsible. It’s my fault for not teaching my daughter well. So, don’t blame her. If you want to blame someone, blame me.” ”

Xie Wanqiu’s tone was full of self-blame.

It was obvious that she was taking all the blame on herself.

Her responsibility?

What did this have to do with Xie Wanqiu?

“Zhou zuolong said, “Wanqiu, what are you saying? ! You are not only the benefactor of our Zhou family, but also the benefactor of Zhou Xiang and Jinbei. “Without you, Xiang Xiang would not have become the wife of the Cen family, and Jinbei would not have become the head of Haicheng City! “Xiang Xiang’s current state is all Wu Lan’s fault. Wu Lan did not teach her well! “As a stepmother, your responsibility has been fulfilled!” ”

Wu Lan was the biological mother of Zhou Xiang and Zhou Jinbei.

“When Wu Lan left, Zhou Xiang was already thirteen years old. ”

A 13-year-old child was naturally more influenced by his biological mother.

Wu Lan was a failed mother.

He couldn’t let Xie wanqiu take the blame for Wu Lan’s failure.

“Hearing that.., xie wanqiu hurriedly said, “Old man, don’t say that. Sister Wu Lan is a good woman. The two children she gave birth to are both dragons and phoenixes among men. She’s not like me. She’s blessed and doesn’t have much luck with children. Speaking of which, I even benefited from sister Wu Lan. If it wasn’t for sister Wu Lan, how could I have two such outstanding children?” ”

“Xie wanqiu kept referring to sister Wu Lan. Her tone was affectionate, as if she had already forgotten that she had interfered between Zhou Zuolong and Wu Lan at that time, causing Wu Lan to commit suicide by lying on the tracks. ”

That’s right.

Wu Lan committed suicide by lying on the tracks.

“Back then, when Wu Lan and Zhou Zuolong were together, their family members had a hundred objections. This was because Zhou Zuolong loved to play too much. He was like a playboy with no integrity. ”

“However, Wu Lan was the daughter of a prestigious family who had received a traditional education. ”

“Although her family members tried to stop her, Wu Lan still married Zhou Zuolong. After their marriage, the two of them did have a period of happiness and had a pair of cute children. ”

“However, this short period of happiness came to an abrupt end when Zhou Xiang was 13 years old. ” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“That year, Wu Lan found out that her husband was cheating on her. ”

Wu Lan questioned Zhou Zuolong.

What did Zhou Zuolong Say?

“He said, “It’s not good for women to be too smart. Many times, they just need to turn a blind eye. If they really can’t go on, they can go to the Civil Affairs Bureau.” ”

“After hearing this, Wu Lan felt like the sky was falling. ”

She didn’t know what to do.

The vows and promises of love in the past seemed to have become a joke.

The love that had once been so intense was now so miserable.

Go to the Civil Affairs Bureau.

Zhou Zuolong had made it sound so simple.

“At that time, she had betrayed her parents and brother to be together with Zhou Zuolong. If they divorced now, how could she have the face to see her parents and brother? ”

“Knowing that Wu Lan was unwilling to divorce, Xie Wanqiu personally came to provoke her. ”

Wu Lan was a lady from a prestigious family. The pride in her bones did not allow her to act like a shrew cursing the streets.

And the pride in her bones did not allow her to go back to her parents’house to complain.

“After all, before she married Zhou Zuolong, her parents had warned her that if she was not happy in the future, she was not allowed to go home and complain. ”

All the pain and suffering was borne by Wu Lan alone.

“Finally, one day. ”

“On a sunny afternoon, Wu Lan left a suicide note. Wearing her favorite clothes, she hugged the wedding photo of her and Zhou Zuolong and lay on the tracks. ”

“After a series of sirens, Wu Lan did not even leave a complete corpse behind. ”

She left just like that.

She left behind a pair of children.

“Zhou Xiang was 13 years old, and Zhou Jinbei was 8 years old. ”

“After Wu Lan left, the Wu family came to Zhou Zuolong and questioned him. Zhou Zuolong hid the matter of Xie wanqiu. The two young children knew nothing about their parents, so they naturally did not know the true cause of their mother’s death. ”
