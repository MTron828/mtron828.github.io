Translator: 549690339

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Don’t worry. This will only temporarily relieve the pain. It Won’t affect adults, nor will it affect my future nephew.” ”

“Okay.”

“After saying that, ye Zao continued, “Sister-in-law, you should relax a little.” ”

“Okay.”

Ye Zao took out two golden needles and pierced them into Bai Jingshu’s acupuncture points.

It was especially magical.

“Almost as soon as the Golden Needles landed on her acupuncture points, Bai Jingshu felt that the throbbing pain had lessened quite a bit. ”

“When the second needle was pierced, the throbbing pain was immediately reduced by two-thirds. ”

“”It really doesn’t hurt that much anymore!”Bai Jingshu continued, “Zao, you’re really amazing!” ”

“Ye Zao said, “It’s good that it’s effective. Sister-in-law, if you feel any discomfort later, you must let me know immediately.” ”

“Okay.”

“Lin Ze looked at BAI Jingshu and continued, “Is it really not painful anymore?” ”

“Yes.”Bai Jingshu nodded.

Lin Ze heaved a sigh of relief. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Ye Zao continued, “But this needle won’t last long. If sister-in-law doesn’t give birth in an hour, the pain will continue.” ”

“Is it as painful as before?”Bai Jingshu immediately asked.

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Yes.”

“Lin Ze immediately asked, “Then is there no other way?” ”

Ye Zhuo shook his head slightly. “There isn’t.”

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “It’s fine, it’s fine. It’s just a little pain. Every mother has gone through it like this. I can endure it.” ”

It was also at this moment that Bai Jingshu finally understood why so many poems and articles were praising mothers.

The role of a mother was ordinary and great.

The only thing that Bai Jingshu could not figure out was why some mothers would abandon their children after giving birth.

She would protect her children with her life.

“After Bai Jingshu stopped feeling pain, the atmosphere in the car brightened up. ”

Giving birth was originally a joyous event.

“At this moment, Ye Shu looked out of the window and suddenly realized something. She looked at Lin Ze. “Why is there a car following your father’s car?” ”

“Lin Ze said, “It might be a passing car.” ”

It was not unusual to have a car on the road.

“Ye Shu shook her head. “No, no, no. I noticed that he was following the car all the way.” ”

“Hearing that, Ye Zhuo also looked out of the window and said, “That seems to be Cen Shaoqing’s car.” ”

“Shaoqing?”Ye Shu asked.

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“How did he know that your sister-in-law was going to give birth?”Ye Shu asked.

“Ye Zao said, “I told him. I thought he would come tomorrow morning. I didn’t expect him to come now.” ”

“Hearing that, Bai Jingshu continued, “I’m just giving birth to a child. Actually, there’s no need to make it so grand. It’s already so late. Zao, Tell your family member to go back quickly.” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “I’ll tell him when we get to the hospital.” ”

“Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded. “You and your parents can go back later. Ah Ze can accompany me. I’ll call you when I give birth.”

Bai Jingshu didn’t think that this was a big deal.

“Besides, it wouldn’t be of much help even if so many people waited at the hospital. It was better to go back and rest well and wait for the child to be born before calling to inform her. ”

“Hearing this, ye Shu said, “It’s more like letting Zhonghua go back! As grandparents, what would we look like if we went back early!” ”

“Speaking up to this point, ye Shu continued, “Besides, what does ah ze know! He doesn’t even know how to carry the child later!” ”

“Under the current situation, even if ye Shu really went back, she wouldn’t be able to fall asleep. ”

“Half an hour later, the car stopped at the entrance of the hospital. ”

“Because Bai Jingshu’s palace entrance hadn’t been fully opened yet, she could only stay in the ward for now. She could only enter the delivery room after the palace entrance was fully opened. ”

“Ye Zao said, “I’ve already arranged the ward. Mom, brother, you guys can bring sister-in-law over. I’ll go look for Cen Shaoqing.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Shu nodded. “You go first.”

Ye Zao got out of the car and walked towards Cen Shaoqing’s car.

Cen Shaoqing pushed open the car door and got out. “How is it? Have you given birth yet?”

“Not yet.”Ye Zao shook his head slightly. “Why are you here?”

“I’m here to accompany you.”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Accompany me for what?” ”

Cen Shaoqing reached out and put his arm around ye Zao’s shoulder. “Isn’t this the duty of a boyfriend?”

“Ye Zao said, “You’re really getting more and more oily.” ”

Cen Shaoqing imitated ye Zao’s usual behavior. “Just average. I haven’t reached the third place in the world yet.”

“”Let’s go in quickly,”ye Zao said. ”

“Okay.”

The two of them walked towards the inpatient department.

“In the VIP ward, because of the injection, Bai Jingzhu was talking and laughing. She did not want to be near a person who was about to give birth. ”
