“Ye Zao looked at Cen Shaoqing and continued, “Where is the cover?” ”

“Here.”Cen Shaoqing pointed to the left.

“”Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly, walked to Cen Shaoqing’s side, lowered his eyebrows, and kissed him. ”

Bang Bang —

“The moment her red lips touched his, she felt a strong heartbeat. It was also at this moment that ye Zao reacted, and his heart was on the left. ”

“Just as ye Zao was about to move his red lips away, the back of his head was pressed down by a hand with a hard wristwatch. His red lips were pressed tightly against his shirt again. ”

“A deep voice sounded above his head. “You have to imprint it a little deeper, otherwise it won’t be obvious.” ”

“A moment later, Cen Shaoqing let go of her and walked to the mirror. He looked at the lipstick on his chest with satisfaction. He took a selfie on his phone and sent it to Song Ziyi. ”

“Seeing him like this, Ye Zhuo could not help but smile. Cen Shaoqing was usually calm and composed, but he did not expect him to have such a childish side. ”

“After sending the photo, Cen Shaoqing looked at Ye Zhuo. “Leader, let’s go.” ”

“Aren’t you going to change your clothes?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“”There’s no need to change.”Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips curled up. “If I change, I won’t be able to achieve my goal.” ”

“What goal?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“”I want everyone to know,”Cen Shaoqing said in a low voice, enunciating each word clearly. “I’ve been stamped by you.” ”

“Ye Zhuo’s face was a little hot. “Cen Shaoqing, I realize that you’re getting worse and worse!” ”

“”It’s all thanks to the leadership’s good training,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“It was also the first time that the other people in the banquet hall saw Cen Shaoqing wearing a suit. They were all guessing which brand the suit on CEN Shaoqing was from, but they actually couldn’t find the same style! ”

“The next morning, Ye Zhuo received a message from the Changyue Kingdom. ”

“Seeing this message, she frowned slightly and immediately sent a message to CEN Shaoqing, asking him to meet her at the coffee shop. ”

“When she arrived, Cen Shaoqing had already arrived. ”

“”Zhuozhuo, what’s So Urgent?” ”

“Ye Zhuo sat down and continued, “It’s about your father.” ”

“My Father?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“”Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly and continued, “Do you have any photos of your uncle when he was young?” ”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

Ye Zao took out a photo. “Take a look at this.”

The Man in the photo was dressed in luxurious clothes and was sitting at his desk. Beside him stood a graceful and elegant woman.

“Seeing this, Cen Shaoqing frowned. “This is a photo of my father.” ”

“However, why was Cen Haifeng standing together with an unfamiliar woman? ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Are you sure this is uncle?” ”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “I’m sure.”

Ye Zhuo thought for a moment. “Can you let me see Uncle’s photo?” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Cen Shaoqing took out his phone. He had always kept an electronic file of his father’s photo.

Ye Zhuo took the phone and compared it carefully.

Both his facial features and figure were exactly the same.

Could it be that this was really the same person?

“After a moment, ye Zhuo continued to ask, “Do you know who the person in the photo is?” ”

“Who is it?”

“”This is the General Alliance of the General Alliance. The person beside him is his wife, Duanmu Fengfei.” ”

“What?”Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly.

He did not expect that the man in the photo was actually the General Alliance of the General Alliance of the S Galaxy!

“If that was really the case, then didn’t that mean that Cen Haifeng was not dead at all? He had always been alive, but he had never appeared! ”

“But if Cen Haifeng was still alive, then what was Zhou Xiang, who had been a widow for him for many years? ”

“What was the Cen family’s old lady, whom he had abandoned for many years? ”

“These two people, one was his wife, and the other was his old mother. ”

Cen Shaoqing was somewhat unable to react.

He had never thought that his father would live on the other side of the world.

“He had also never thought that the tall, handsome, and responsible father in his impression would do such a thing. ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “The world is so big, and there are all kinds of strange things. Perhaps it’s just that they look exactly the same. If you want to confirm whether he is an uncle, you have to do an appraisal. How about this, give me three hairs with hair follicles, and I’ll think of a way to get an appraisal.” ”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing pulled out three strands of hair from his head and gave them to Ye Zao.

“Ye Zao took out a self-sealing bag and put it away. He then said, “Don’t tell Grandma and Aunt Xiang about this first. Wait for my results.” ”

“When will the results be out?”
