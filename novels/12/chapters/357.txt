“Chapter 358: 111: mother, uncle, trying to curry favor with your future uncle, trying to compete with her! 4”

Xiao Zhang shook his head.

He really didn’t believe it.

“If Cen Shaoqing had been enlightened, he would have been enlightened long ago. ”

Would he have waited until now?

“Then you’ll have to wait.”

The reason ye Sen had a bad impression of Cen Shaoqing in the past was that he felt that Cen Shaoqing was a playboy with a complicated love history.

Now it seemed that he had misunderstood Cen Shaoqing.

“Not only did he not have a complicated love history, but he was also clean in both body and mind. ”

He was born into a wealthy family and was so noble!

How many people could be as self-disciplined as Cen Shaoqing?

“If he could really catch ye Zhuo’s eye, it would be a good marriage. ”

Ye Sen was originally worried that no one would be able to match up to her because ye Zhuo was so powerful.

Now it seemed that Cen Shaoqing was quite suitable.

“Whether it was in terms of looks, ability, or other aspects, he and ye Zao were evenly matched. ”

A strong alliance!

“Thinking of this, the corners of Ye Sen’s mouth curled up slightly. ”

...

Time passed very quickly.

“In the blink of an eye, another three days passed. ”

Today was the day of Old Madam Song’s funeral.

The weather was gloomy and the sky was drizzling. It was very much like the mood of the guests who were there to send off Old Madam Song.

Ye Zhuo was wearing a black dress and stood among the people who were sending her off.

It was drizzling.

Song Shiyu carried Old Madam Song’s urn and walked in front with his assistant holding an umbrella for him.

The guests discussed in low voices.

“It was nothing more than saying that song Shiyu was an unfilial descendant, cold-blooded and heartless. ”

“Old Madam Song had raised him since he was young. Now That Old Madam Song had passed away, he did not even shed a single tear. ”

Even a crocodile had a single tear

But he was not even as good as a crocodile!

Ye Zhuo frowned slightly and looked up at song Shiyu who was standing in front of him.

“The crowd’s discussion was clearly quite loud, but he acted as if he did not hear them. He placed the urn into the cemetery with a calm expression and gave a deep bow. ”

“After the funeral, everyone left. ”

Song Shiyu looked at his assistant beside him. “You can leave first. I want to be alone for a while.”

The assistant nodded.

“The rain had stopped, but the air was still gloomy. ”

Song Shiyu stood in front of the Tombstone and looked at Old Madam song in the photo.

He didn’t say a word.

Rumble —

A huge thunder suddenly sounded in the sky.

Bean-sized raindrops fell down fiercely.

But song Shiyu didn’t have any intention of leaving. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“The raindrops fell on his hair, and his exquisite facial features flowed along the outline to his collar. In the rain, his slender figure looked like a tall and straight statue. ”

The wind and rain were unshakeable.

“At this moment, a black umbrella was placed over his head to cover the raindrops. A white hand handed him a clean handkerchief. “Wipe your face.” ”

A very clear and shallow voice echoed with the voice from more than ten years ago.

“”Brother, have a candy.” ”

Song Shiyu lowered his eyes slightly and saw a face that looked like a painting.

“It was not stained with makeup, but it made one’s mind confused. ”

“Thank you.”Song Shiyu took the handkerchief that ye Zao passed to him.

The white handkerchief carried a faint fragrance of grass and trees.

It seeped into his heart.

“”The dead are dead, and the living are like this. Brother song, I’m sorry for your loss.” ”

The corners of Song Shiyu’s mouth curled up. “I’m not sad.”

“Your eyes can’t deceive people.”Ye Zao’s tone was indifferent.

“Even though song Shiyu did not shed a single tear from the beginning to the end, there was a sense of desolation on his body. ”

That desolation came from deep within his bones.

It could not be concealed.

Song Shiyu wiped the rain off his face. “Thank you.”

“”You’re welcome.”Ye Zao continued, “The rain won’t stop for a while. Why Don’t we go back?” ”

“Okay.”Song Shiyu nodded and took the umbrella from ye Zao. “I’ll hold it.”

Song Shiyu was nearly 1.89 meters tall.

Ye Zao was 1.3 meters tall.

It was a bit strenuous to hold the umbrella for him.

Ye Zao didn’t refuse.

The two of them walked down the steps of the cemetery.

“If there were any outsiders present, they would definitely notice that the umbrella in song Shiyu’s hand was almost completely covering the top of ye Zao’s head. ”

“Meanwhile, the side of his shoulder was already drenched. ”

The two of them were speechless the entire way.

“The cemetery was already very gloomy. Furthermore, it was raining today. Under the oppression of the layers of dark clouds, the entire cemetery was like a cage that trapped people inside, making it difficult for them to breathe. ”

“Song Shiyu’s hands, which were stuck in his trouser pockets, were slightly trembling. ”

“In a trance, he returned to that helpless night. He missed his footing and his body leaned forward rapidly. Just as he was about to roll down the stairs, a white hand grabbed him in time. “Be careful.” ”
