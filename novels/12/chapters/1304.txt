Translator: 549690339

“Seeing Cen Yueya, Old Madam Cen said in surprise, “Why is the second girl back! Aren’t you overseas? Why are you back today!” ”

“Cen Yueya smiled and said, “Last night in the group chat, I saw eldest sister and the third girl saying that Shaoqing Is Bringing Zha Zha home today. Coincidentally, Grandma and Wanyin are also here, so I came back to take a look.” ”

Just in time?

Xie Wanqiu’s face was gloomy.

“What Cen Yueya meant was, as a grandma, she could not even be compared to an outsider? ”

“Cen Yueya’s main purpose was to come back to see ye Zhuo. As a grandma, she was just passing by to take a look. ” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

This kind of granddaughter was really raised in vain!

“Dang Lian, if it wasn’t for her dragging Zhou Xiang up through the mud and urine, would they have become what they are now? ”

Ingrates!

They were all a bunch of ingrates!

“If she had known earlier, she would not have raised Zhou Xiang and left her to fend for herself. ”

“Second cousin.”Zheng Wanyin stood up to greet her.

“”Wanyin, long time no see. You’ve become beautiful again!”Cen Yueya had always been a sweet talker. ”

“Zheng wanyin said very modestly, “Second cousin is flattering me again. Even if I’m beautiful, I’m not as beautiful as cousin-in-law.”Although ye Zao’s beauty was artificial, it was still a kind of beauty. ”

“Cen Yueya smiled and said, “Who asked you to compare yourself with Zao Zao? Zao Zao is a non-human!”Zheng Wanyin was still a beauty that could make people’s eyes shine. ”

“After all, in this world, how many people could grow up to be like ye Zao? ”

Don’t compare yourself with ye Zao?

“Xie Wanqiu was already very unhappy. After hearing these words, she became even more unhappy. ”

What did Cen Yueya Mean?

Was she hinting that Zheng Wanyin could not compare to ye Zao?

What was ye Zao?

He was worthy to be compared to the pearl in her hand!

The CEN sisters were each more insensible than the other.

“Yet, each of them married better than the other. ”

No one knew how their in-laws had taken a liking to them.

Did they not have eyes?

“Xie wanqiu held her anger in her heart, but she could not show it. She could only swallow it. ”

“Zheng Wanyin frowned slightly. Looking at Cen Yueya, she knew that she did not know that ye Zao’s beauty was fake. ”

“However, it was normal that she did not know. If she had not made any minor adjustments, she would not have known that ye Zao was fake. ”

Her plastic surgeon once said something.

Ten out of ten beauties had made minor adjustments.

There were no natural beauties in this world.

She wondered how the Cen family would react when they found out about this?

“Zheng Wanyin suppressed the messy thoughts in her heart and continued, “Second sister, are you the only one here? Why haven’t you seen second brother-in-law?” ”

“Cen Yueya replied, “Your second brother-in-law is out on a business trip.” ”

“OH.”Zheng Wanyin nodded.

“Cen Yueya sat on the sofa and took out a jewelry box to pass to Ye Zao. “Zao Zao, when I was shopping in C Nation, I found a necklace that suits you very well. Quickly put it on and try it on.”Cen Yueya liked ye Zao very much, just like Old Madam Cen, whenever she saw a good-looking jewelry in a shopping mall, she would immediately think of Ye Zao and buy it. ”

“Of course, Ye Zao was also very generous to the CEN sisters. He knew that they were loyal fans of Zy, so whenever ZY came up with a new product, ye Zao would ask someone to save one for them. ”

Liking each other was mutual.

“Ye Zao reached out and took the jewelry box. “Thank you, second sister.” ”

“You’re welcome.”.

“After saying that, Cen Yueya handed Zheng Wanyin another jewelry box. “Wanyin, this is for you.” ”

“Do I have a present too?”Zheng Wanyin was flattered.

Cen Yueya nodded. “Of course.”

“Zheng Wanyin opened the jewelry box. It was a very nice looking bracelet from a famous luxury brand. “It’s so beautiful! Second cousin, thank you! Grandma, this is the bracelet second cousin gave me.” ”

Xie wanqiu smiled in response. “Second lass has good taste.”

She could tell that Cen Yueya did not intend to give Zheng Wanyin a present.

“If Cen Yueya really wanted to give Zheng Wanyin a present, she would not have given it to ye Zhuo first and then Zheng Wanyin. ”

“After all, in terms of relationship, Zheng Wanyin was the one who was closer to Cen Yueya. ”

Not to mention that ye Zao had not entered yet.

Taking a step back.

So what if ye Zao had entered?

“Even if ye Zao had entered, he was still an outsider. ”

But Cen Yueya clearly valued ye Zao more.

“In Cen Yueya’s eyes, Zheng Wanyin was a dispensable transparent person. ”

To think that Zheng Wanyin was so happy.

There was no one in this family that she liked.
