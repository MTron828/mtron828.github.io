Chapter 72: 072: Face slapping! In the burning business empire, Lin Sha recognized the scumbag and had an abortion

Zhang Qiang was several years older than Lin Sha.

His parents had long hoped that he would get married and start a family and have a grandson soon.

But because Zhang Qiang’s girlfriend was Lin Sha, their marriage had been delayed until now.

Now that Lin Sha was pregnant, his parents would definitely be very happy.

Compared to his eldest grandson, eighty thousand Yuan was nothing?

The more Zhang Qiang thought about it, the happier he became.

He couldn’t wait to go home and share the good news with his parents.

Lin Shasha continued, “Last time, my parents were angry about the dowry. This time, shouldn’t your parents go to my house to apologize to my parents?”

Before this, the Zhang family couldn’t even bear to part with eighty thousand yuan, so the Lin family’s parents were really disappointed.

Zhang Qiang quickly nodded. “Of course! Don’t Worry, Shasha. I’ll make my parents apologize.”

“That’s good.”Seeing Zhang Qiang’s good attitude, Lin Shasha was also relieved. She knew that Zhang Qiang was definitely not the kind of person ye Zao had described.

How could she and the child not even be worth 80,000 yuan in Zhang Qiang’s heart?

Back at home.

Zhang Qiang told his parents the good news.

Hearing this, mother Zhang looked at Zhang Qiang in surprise. “What did you say?”

Zhang Qiang continued, “I said that Sha Sha is pregnant! She has my child!”

Father Zhang was sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper. When he heard this, he said with a face full of joy, “Really? Xiao Lin is really pregnant?”

“Really!”Zhang Qiang took out the test report from his bag. “Look, this is the hospital report.”

Father Zhang took the report with trembling hands and saw the words clearly on it. He said excitedly, “There’s a future! Our Old Zhang family finally has a future! God bless! Thank you, Bodhisattva!”

Father Zhang immediately knelt on the ground and kowtowed a few times.

Mother Zhang snatched the report from father Zhang’s hands, “What are you meddling in? Are you really pregnant?”

“Mom, you’re going to have a grandchild soon!”

Mother Zhang did not show much joy. She frowned and said, “Is she trying to threaten you with pregnancy?”

“What?”Zhang Qiang was stunned.

Mother Zhang snorted. “Don’t tell me she didn’t ask for anything!”

She had seen many people like Lin Sha. She just wanted to use the child to tie Zhang Qiang down.

Pregnant before marriage!

She was really unscrupulous.

Pui!

Shameless!

The Zhang family had been through a lot of bad luck for eight lifetimes to meet such a shameless woman.

Zhang Qiang continued, “Shasha didn’t have any requests. She just hoped that our family could pay the 80,000 yuan betrothal gift, and then... and then...”

“And then what?”Mother Zhang’s face turned cold.

Zhang Qiang scratched his head. “Then she wants you and dad to go to her house and apologize to her parents.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Go, go, Go! It’s the right thing to do!”Father Zhang stood up from the ground, then said: “Speaking of which, that day is indeed our wrong, the first time to recognize the family, how can we empty-handed it!”! Also, 80,000 yuan is not a lot, and now that Kobayashi is pregnant, I don’t think 180,000 yuan is a lot... ... ...”

“Shut Up!”Mother Zhang Glanced at Father Zhang. “What do you know? Are you the one in charge of this family or am I?”

Father Zhang immediately shut up. He did not dare to say a word, like a mouse seeing a cat.

“Mom...”Zhang Qiang did not understand what his mother meant.

Mother Zhang placed her hands on her hips and scolded like a shrew, “Little B * Tch! Bah! Do you really think that you can threaten me just because you have a seed in your stomach? ! I have eaten more salt than she has eaten! Fight with me!”

Zhang Qiang’s mother was a sensible person. She knew that Zhang Qiang’s character was very soft.

He was exactly the same as Zhang Qiang’s father.

Once Lin Sha married him, he would definitely listen to Lin Sha in everything.

When that time came, where would she have the right to speak as her mother?

So, she must not let Lin Sha get her way!

Lin Sha wanted to use her pregnancy to show her off?

No Way!

If a tiger doesn’t show its strength, she would treat her like a sick cat!

Shameless Little Bitch!

“Mom, don’t talk about Sha Sha like that. She is pregnant with my child now.”Zhang Qiang looked troubled.

Zhang Qiang’s mother snorted coldly. “Which woman doesn’t know how to get pregnant and give birth? Do you really think that she is the only hen in the world who can lay eggs? You want our family to fork out 80,000 yuan as a betrothal gift? And you want me to apologize to her? Dream On!”

“Mom, don’t tell me you don’t want to fork out 80,000 yuan?”Zhang Qiang looked at mother Zhang in surprise.

“No!”Mother Zhang crossed her arms in front of her chest.

Not to mention 80,000 yuan, she wouldn’t even fork out 80% .
