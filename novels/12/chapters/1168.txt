“In the past few years, whenever the lawyer wanted to look for him, it was mostly because of Zhao Xueyin. ”

This time was definitely no exception.

The lawyer did not hide anything and nodded. “Yes.”

“Yang Wenhao frowned. “Brother Yu, actually, if you didn’t come looking for me, I would have wanted to talk to you too. I’ve met Uncle.” ”

“Hearing the word ‘uncle’, Si Lui’s expression turned ugly. ”

Si lui was very clear about what old master Jin had said to Yang Wenhao.

“Yang Wenhao continued, “Brother Yu, let bygones be bygones. I can tell that uncle is very regretful now. He doesn’t feel good either! “It’s been three years. Let’s go back! “Don’t let Uncle Worry.”What had happened that year.., yang Wenhao did not know. ”

“But he saw how Old Master Jin, an old man in his seventies, said that his eyes were red in front of him. It was really not easy. ”

Si lui looked up slightly. “You want to be his lobbyist?” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Seeing si lui like this, Yang Wenhao sighed. “Brother Yu, he is your father after all.” ”

“Si Lui’s eyes were already filled with impatience. “Wenhao, you are not me. You will never know what I have experienced.” ”

Don’t try to persuade others to be kind without going through the hardships of others.

“If Yang Wenhao had experienced what he had been through, would he still say these words? ”

“Yang Wenhao continued, “Brother Yu, let’s talk about Zhao Xueyin.” ”

Si lui did not say anything.

Yang Wenhao deliberated over the words in his heart. “I feel that you’re not suitable for her. She’s not worthy of your liking.”

“”You’re wrong.”Si lui looked up at Yang Wenhao. “If I’m not worthy, it’s because I’m not worthy of her.” ”

He had always been the one who was not good enough for Zhao Xueyin.

He was very glad that Zhao Xueyin had him in her heart.

“Although neither of them had broken through that layer of window paper, the lawyer knew that the feelings that he and Zhao Xueyin had for each other were mutual. ”

They both had each other in their hearts.

“Sometimes, even if they liked each other, they did not have to say it out loud. ”

“This way, the lawyer was a little too humble. ”

“Yang Wenhao frowned, “Brother Yu, wake up. The person Zhao Xueyin likes is not you. No matter how much you help her, she won’t look at you anymore. She is using you, your talents, and your connections!” ”

It was said that the IQ of a person who was in love was 0.

“Yang Wenhao did not believe this sentence in the past, but he believed it now. ”

That was because Si lui had always been a smart person.

Only in this matter did he make a mistake.

His cleverness was mistaken by his cleverness.

He thought that Zhao Xueyin was like him and loved him deeply.

“In fact, Zhao Xueyin was using him. ”

“Si Lui’s expression did not change, but there was a layer of dark clouds in his eyes. He raised his head and looked at Yang Wenhao. “Are you done?” ”

Yang Wenhao was stunned.

“Si lui continued, “If you’re not willing to help, I can find someone else.” ”

“In Si Lui’s network, Yang Wenhao was not the only one who had worked with Qian You. ”

“Yang Wenhao quickly said, “Brother Yu, don’t be angry! We’ve been brothers for so many years. Don’t tell me we have to fall out over a woman?” ”

“”In my heart, Xueyin is not as simple as a woman.”Si Lui’s expression was serious. ”

She was still his confidant.

Zhao Xueyin’s position in his heart was something that no one could replace.

He would not allow anyone to insult Zhao Xueyin.

“Seeing that he was so serious, Yang Wenhao continued, “Brother Yu, I have already said that no matter what you do, I will support you unconditionally! I hope that you will not regret it in the future.” ”

Regret?

It did not exist!

Zhao Xueyin would make her regret it?

That was impossible!

“Hearing that, Si Lui’s expression softened, “Thank you. “Please believe me as well. Xueyin is not the kind of person you think she is. She is the kindest girl I have ever met. If you don’t believe her, it is useless for me to say anything more! “Time will tell. You will understand in the future.” ”

Time will prove everything.

“One day, those who misunderstood Zhao Xueyin would personally apologize to Zhao Xueyin for their previous actions. ”

“Yang Wenhao smiled and said, “If there really is such a day, I’m looking forward to it.” ”

Zhao Xueyin would really not disappoint the lawyer?

The lawyer’s expression was firm. “There will definitely be.”

“Yang Wenhao did not continue this topic. “Alright, let’s not talk about this anymore. Brother Yu, you just asked me to organize a recommendation for you, right?” ”

“Yes.”Si Lu nodded.

“Yang Wenhao continued, “To tell you the truth, I have never met drink a little.” ”

Si Lu frowned slightly. “Didn’t you two work together before?”

“Yang Wenhao said, “We did work together before, but it was all done by drink a little’s assistant, Rebecca. Rebecca and I are very familiar with each other. I can try to contact Rebecca.” ”
