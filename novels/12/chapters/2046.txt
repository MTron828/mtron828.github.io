“Chapter 2047: 426: Ye Zao appears in the general election, Qiu Di and the others are dumbfounded! 4”

What a pity.

I will never see such a girl again.

“However, Qiu Di will definitely not disappoint the people of changyue. ”

“After all, Qiu Di was handpicked by Ye Zao. ”

“No matter what, the person chosen by ye Zao definitely won’t be too bad. ”

Bai changhu almost lost his balance. He simply didn’t believe that this was true.

How could an accident happen to Ye Zhuo in the laboratory?

No.

It couldn’t be.

“After a long while, Bai changhu finally reacted. He raised his head and looked at the head chief, “Head Chief, how could you joke about such a thing!” ”

“”Yes, yes, yes, joke. The head chief must be joking with us.”Everyone heaved a sigh of relief. ”

“For a moment, the atmosphere seemed to have returned to a relaxed state. ”

“Everyone tried their best to maintain the smile on their lips, trying their best to act as if nothing had happened just now. ”

“The head chief looked at everyone, he then said, “Everyone, I’m really sorry. I didn’t have the time to issue an obituary before to inform everyone. Firstly, it’s because the current situation is unstable. Secondly, I was afraid that everyone wouldn’t be able to accept this reality, so I’ve been dragging it out until now... ...” ”

The crowd below the stage could not accept this news no matter what. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The chief faced the crowd and bowed deeply.”... I’m sorry.”

“At this moment, a figure rushed forward quickly. Fortunately, there were bodyguards who stopped him. ”

“The person who rushed over was a young man who looked to be in his mid-twenties. At this moment, his furious facial features had already been twisted into a ball, he pointed at Shangguan Jue on the stage and said, “I’m sorry! What’s the use of being sorry? Can being sorry make miss ye come back to life? Let me tell you, that autumn flute, we don’t recognize it!” ”

“”Right, we don’t recognize it! We Only Want Miss Ye to come back!” ”

“Ye Zhuo’s influence was not just for show. At this moment, the venue had already turned into a pot of porridge. ”

“But fortunately, the head patriarch and the others had long been prepared and quickly suppressed the situation that had gone out of control. ”

“I know that it’s very difficult for everyone to accept this matter. I’m the same as everyone else. I can’t accept it either. I can’t accept Miss Ye leaving us just like that. But things have already happened. It’s not something that we can avoid just by running away! Running away will only make us even weaker!”

“The head patriarch pressed his temples, then he said, “What did miss ye say when she was around? “No matter what, we must believe in light and hope. Although Miss Ye is no longer around, we still have Miss Qiu. Miss Qiu is Miss Ye’s personally chosen successor, the new female monarch. Could it be that everyone is doubting Miss Ye’s judgment?” ”

Zhao Dan stood up at the right time. “The head chief is right. I believe that Miss Qiu di is a very good leader. She will definitely be able to lead Chang Yue nation towards a new tomorrow!”

Zhao Dan was the mother of the Manxing Nation and the first lady. Her words naturally carried a certain weight.

“As the First Lady of the Manxing Nation, it was not easy for Qiu di to gain her recognition. Unless Qiu di really had something extraordinary. ”

“”Unless you let Miss ye stand on the stage to announce this news personally, otherwise, we won’t believe anyone’s words!”Liu Zhengting stood up and said. ”

“Right! President Liu is right! We need to hear Miss Ye personally announce this news!”

“Miss Ye!”

Qiu Di stood behind the stage and looked at the people below the stage who stood up to oppose her.

She wanted to firmly remember the faces of these people.

“When the time came, she would make each and every one of them pay the price! ”

“Thinking of this, Qiu di narrowed her eyes and turned to look at the assistant beside her. “Come over.” ”

The assistant took a step forward.

Qiu Di lowered his head and whispered a few words to the assistant.

“Hearing this, the assistant nodded and walked forward. ”

“The assistant walked all the way to the rostrum and stood beside Shangguan Jue. He said in a low voice, “Head chief, the eldest miss asked me to tell you to leave this place to her. She will take care of it.” ”

“The head chief nodded. “Okay, I got it. You can go down first.” ”

The assistant walked back.

“The chief looked at the crowd, then he said, “Everyone, everyone, please be quiet.”. Shangguan Jue understood everyone’s feelings very well, because at this moment, Shangguan Jue’s feelings were the same as everyone else’s. However, what had happened had already happened. No matter what we do now, it could not be salvaged! “The road is under our feet. We still have to keep moving forward. We can not stop moving forward.” ”

“At this point, the head of the clan paused for a moment before continuing, “Next, I would like to invite Miss Qiu di Qiu to come out and meet everyone. Everyone, give her a round of applause.” ”

“After he finished speaking, the entire venue was filled with scattered applause. Looking around, there were only a few people from the eight great clans clapping. ”
