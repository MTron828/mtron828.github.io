Translator: 549690339

“Hearing this, Buttface also came over to take a look. “Don’t tell me, they really look alike!” ”

“Let me take a look.”Li Wen also came over.

“The person in the video looked like a painting. He had a pair of delicate phoenix eyes, red lips and white teeth. When he looked back, his smile was filled with a myriad of amorous feelings. ”

Take a closer look.

That pair of flawless phoenix eyes was exactly the same as Lin Ze’s phoenix eyes.

These two people’s looks were at least 30% similar!

“”F * ck!”Li Wen said in surprise, “They really do look alike! Brother Ze, is the school Belle really your long-lost sister?” ”

“Dog Two and fat tiger also turned to look at Lin Ze, their eyes filled with curiosity. ”

Lin Ze looked at the video. “You guys are overthinking things.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Lin Jincheng was 40 years old this year, and he was 19 years old. ”

“During these 19 years, Lin Jincheng had been paralyzed in bed for more than 10 years. ”

Where did he get a sister?

“Li Wen smiled and said, “Brother Ze, the two of you are the school Belle and the school Belle. They say that if you don’t belong to the same family, then you don’t belong to the same family. What if it really is your sister? What will you do?” ”

“Fat Tiger did not mind watching the show. “Brother Ze, your sister is so beautiful. When the time comes, will you become a sis-con?” ”

“Lin Ze’s tone was indifferent. “She can’t be my sister, and I won’t become a sis-con either.” ”

“”Brother Ze, don’t be so full of yourself!”! “What if she really is your long-lost sister? Can you still kick her out?”Fat tiger continued, “If the school Belle is my sister, then I can become a sis-con in no time!”! “No one can have any ideas about my sister!” ”

“Li Wen agreed with fat tiger. “If this is my sister, I’ll be her bodyguard every day! If anyone dares to make her frown, I’ll fight them to the death!” ”

Dog two nodded in agreement.

“Apart from Li Wen having an older brother, the three of them were only children. They had neither an older sister nor a younger sister. ”

“”Brother Ze, don’t you want the school Belle to be your younger sister at all?”Dog two turned to look at Lin Ze. ”

“Lin Ze shook his head. “No.”Lin Ze had been unwilling to get close to girls since he was young. Because of Feng Xianxian, he didn’t have a good impression of girls. In his eyes, a younger sister was equivalent to trouble and a burden. ”

“Other people had their first love during puberty, but Lin ze spent his adolescence dreaming of finding his mother. ”

“If it was possible, he could even use the title of the top scorer in the college entrance examination to exchange for news of his mother. ”

Unfortunately.

He couldn’t.

“At the thought of this, Lin Ze’s eyes dimmed a little. He took a sip of wine. ”

They said that wine could dispel sorrow.

But why did he get more and more depressed the more he drank?

“Fat Tiger raised his glass to Lin Ze and drank the wine in one gulp. He smiled and said, “Brother ZE, if the school Belle is really your sister, then there will be a good show to watch!” ”

“Lin Ze also raised his glass. “Don’t worry, you won’t be able to watch this show.” ”

It was impossible for him to have a sister.

“Li Wen continued, “If, I say if, if the school Belle is really your father’s promiscuous affair, what will you do?” ”

“Lin Ze put down his glass. “Judging from the time, my father won’t have the chance to go out and get promiscuous affairs, much less have the chance to keep a child around our age.” ”

“”You’re right.”Li Wen nodded. “After all, the school Belle is in the same batch as us, so she’s probably about the same age as us.” ”

“Hearing this, Fat Tiger and dog two looked disappointed. ”

They felt that the school Belle and Lin Ze looked a little alike.

“However, they had neglected the issue of time. ”

“Judging from the time, neither Lin Jincheng nor Lin Ze’s birth mother could have two children at such a similar time. ”

Unless...

The two of them were twins.

But that was even more impossible!

“The Lin family had always only given birth to boys, not girls. If Lin Ze’s birth mother was really pregnant with twins, the old lady of the Lin family would probably be so happy to worship Lin Ze’s birth mother like a bodhisattva. ”

“After all, Old Lady Lin treated Feng Xianxian, who was not related by blood, so well. ”

How could she bear to let the Lin family’s child wander outside

So.

This was almost impossible.

“Li Wen continued, “But brother Ze, are you really not going to look for the school Belle to get her contact information?” ”

Lin Ze shook his head.

Li Wen also knew what Lin Ze was thinking.

“After so many years, Lin Ze’s biggest wish was to find his biological mother. ”

“”Brother Ze, didn’t you say you wanted to make an appointment with z last time? Have you made it yet? What did Xiao Dan Say?” ”

Lin Ze’s voice was a little muffled. “There’s no news for now.”

“Li Wen comforted him. “Brother Ze, don’t worry. As long as there are clues, I believe it’s only a matter of time before we find Auntie.” ”
