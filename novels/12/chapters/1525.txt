“After sending this wechat message, Zhang Qingqing narrowed her eyes and waited for dog two’s reply with anticipation.”

“Without a girlfriend, Lin Ze definitely didn’t have a girlfriend!”

“Through their interaction today, dog two knew that Zhang Qingqing was interested in Lin Ze.”

Zhang Qingqing sent this wechat message with obvious intentions. She was testing whether Lin Ze had a girlfriend.

She just wanted to know if Lin Ze had a girlfriend to ask an Lizi. There was no need to go around asking him.

The reason why Zhang Qingqing asked this was definitely because an Lizi told her that Lin ze already had a girlfriend.

“This was a disguised rejection. At a time like this, he naturally couldn’t hold him back.”

Buttface continued to reply: [ brother Ze’s girlfriend is more introverted. She likes quiet. Let’s talk again when there’s a chance! ]

Ding Dong —

“Hearing the reply from wechat, Zhang Qingqing immediately picked up her phone. When she saw Buttface’s reply, the light in Zhang Qingqing’s eyes instantly dimmed.”

He has a girlfriend!

Lin Ze actually has a girlfriend!

How could this be?

What kind of girl could be worthy of such a handsome boy like Lin Ze?

“When she thought that Lin Ze actually had a girlfriend, Zhang Qingqing was extremely jealous. She couldn’t wait to break up with Lin Ze’s girlfriend.”

On Buttface’s side.

Buttface sent Lin ze his and Zhang Qingqing’s chat records.

Lin Ze replied: [ ? ? ? ]

Buttface continued to reply: [ didn’t you realize that I’ve done you a huge favor? ]

“[ favor. ] In other words, he didn’t have the time to read it.”

“HOW UNROMANTIC! Why would a girl like this like him?”Buttface replied: [ I’ve helped you block a Rotten Peach Blossom! Hurry up and thank me! ]

“OH.”

“Oh what! Rubbish! Say Thank you! Give me a red packet! Zhang Qingqing is doubting her life now!”

“Red Packet”Lin ze sent a red packet over.

“”I won’t accept the red packet. If you really want to thank me, help me find out what type of boys your cousin likes.””

Buttface originally wanted to get to know an Lizi through Zhang Qingqing. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“But now, it seemed that this method wouldn’t work. After all, Zhang Qingqing had other motives.”

“After a long while, Lin Ze didn’t reply.”

Dog Two waited anxiously.

“After about ten minutes, there was finally some movement on wechat.”

“Dog two hurriedly opened wechat. He thought that Lin Ze had answered his question, but he didn’t expect Lin Ze’s reply to be: [ is there a case? ]”

“Buttface was a little disappointed. After a while, he replied: [ yes. ]”

Lin Ze then sent him a string of links.

“When Buttface saw the commission, he thought that he was hallucinating. During this period of time, he had accepted many commissions. There were five-digit ones and six-digit ones, but this was the first time he had seen seven-digit ones.”

Was it an illusion?

“Buttface rubbed his eyes, but the numbers on the screen didn’t change.”

He wasn’t mistaken.

Buttface opened the wechat group and sent a screenshot over: [ is my system out of Order? ]

“[ yes, mine is the same. ] Li Wen replied.”

[ ditto. ] Fat Tiger also replied.

Buttface was a little excited. [ brother Ze is awesome! ]

...

On the other side.

“Zhang Qingqing felt very uncomfortable. When she remembered that she still had a suitor, her heart felt much better. She called an Lizi again.”

“When she received Zhang Qingqing’s call, an Lizi was putting on a face mask. “Hello, Qingqing.””

“Zhang Qingqing continued, “Lizi, I have something to ask you.””

“”You ask,”an Lizi said.”

“Zhang Qingqing said, “How is that Buttface’s family background?””

“It wasn’t that she looked down on buttface, but it was that buttface really didn’t look like a rich second generation.”

“Fatty Tiger and Li Wen were both wearing big brands, but Buttface was wearing an unknown street stall.”

His cell phone was also very casual.

“In short, he didn’t dress like a rich second generation.”

“However, it wasn’t necessarily true that Buttface was an invisible second generation. This kind of thing had to be investigated.”

Zhang Qingqing did not want to do anything risky.

“”I only met Ah Ze’s friends today,”an lizi continued, “So I’m not very sure.””

Not sure?

Zhang Qingqing was a little disappointed. “Then can you help me ask around?”

An Lizi frowned. “How can I ask about this kind of thing?”

It was too impolite.

“”Are you still my best friend? !”Zhang Qingqing complained. “Lizi, you’re Rich Now! What about me? ! It’s said that wealth and honor are inseparable. You Can’t Forget Me!””
