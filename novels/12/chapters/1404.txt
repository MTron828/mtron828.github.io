Translator: 549690339

“In other words, Zhou Jinbei was now riding a tiger. ”

Zhou Jinbei worked hard for half of his life in exchange for today’s success. Could it be that all his years of hard work would be destroyed just like that?

How could it be!

No one would be willing to joke about their own future.

“So, there was only one path in front of Zhou Jinbei now. ”

And that was...

Compromise!

Admit his mistake!

“Therefore, Xie Wanqiu was not anxious at all. ”

This Xie Rongle was definitely going to marry Zhou Jinbei.

“”Aunt, when do you think Zhou Jinbei will come?”Xie rongle continued to ask. ”

“Xie wanqiu narrowed her eyes, “With such a big mess in the Zhou Corporation, Zhou Jinbei must be busy controlling public opinion. Tomorrow, at most, it won’t be more than the day after tomorrow! After all, if Zhou Jinbei wants to completely control public opinion, he must come and beg your uncle.” ”

Xie rongle nodded. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Xie wanqiu patted Xie Rongle’s hand, then, she said, “Rongle, this Zhou Jinbei only has one son, Zhou Zeyan. According to my understanding, this Zhou Zeyan is also not a good person. After marrying Zhou Jinbei, the first thing he did was to conceive Zhou Jinbei’s child and chase that little ingrate Zhou Zeyan out of the Zhou family!” ”

Only the children of the Xie family were qualified to inherit the Zhou family’s property.

Zhou Zeyan was nothing!

“Xie rongle smiled and said, “Aunt, Zhou Jinbei is so old. Can he still have children?” ”

“”An old man in his 70s or 80s can have children, not to mention that Zhou Jinbei is not even 50 years old this year!”Xie wanqiu continued, “Don’t worry. As long as you work hard, Zhou Jinbei will definitely be able to have children!” ”

“Alright.”Xie rongle nodded.

“Xie wanqiu continued, “Rongle, you have to make good use of this opportunity.” ”

“”Don’t worry, Aunty. I will make good use of it.” ”

Xie wanqiu nodded in satisfaction.

“After the transfer procedures were completed, Xie Wanqiu was arranged to be admitted to the second hospital overnight. ”

The next morning.

Zhou Xiang woke up and saw the news that popped up on her phone.

“When she saw the news, Zhou Xiang thought she was hallucinating. ”

It was as if she had rubbed her eyes several times to make sure that she was not seeing things.

She never dreamed that Zhou Zuolong would do something so extreme.

“Once the news was confirmed, Zhou Zuolong’s life would be over! ”

“Not only would Zhou Zuolong be finished, even Zhou Zeyan would be affected. ”

Zhou Xiang’s hand that was holding her phone was trembling. She immediately ran to Zhou Jinbei’s room door.

“She knocked on the door for a long time, but there was no response from inside. ”

“The maid walked over. “Madam, are you looking for Mr. Zhou?” ”

“Yes.”Zhou Xiang nodded. “Where’s Jinbei?”

“The maid said, “Mr. Zhou is having breakfast downstairs in the dining room.” ”

Breakfast!

“After such a big incident, Zhou Jinbei was still in the mood to have breakfast! ”

He was too ambitious!

Zhou Xiang quickly went downstairs.

“Downstairs, Zhou Jinbei was eating breakfast slowly. ”

It was obvious that he did not care about the news and the trending news.

“”Jinbei, have you seen the news?”Zhou Xiang sat opposite Zhou Jinbei. ”

“I have.”Zhou Jinbei’s tone was indifferent.

“Zhou Xiang said with a sullen face, “You’re still in the mood to eat after seeing it? Do you know how serious this matter is!” ”

“Zhou Jinbei drank a mouthful of milk. “Sister, the Emperor is really not in a hurry.” ”

“Zhou Jinbei!”Zhou Xiang snatched the milk from Zhou Jinbei’s hand. “Go and apologize to mom and dad right now and ask him to come forward and clarify!”

“Now, they could only ask Zhou Zuolong to come forward and clarify. ”

“Other than that, there was no other way! ”

“Zhou Jinbei was not angry. “Sister, if I were to apologize to them, would I have to wait until now?” ”

“”Jinbei,”Zhou Xiang continued, “Do you really want things to get out of hand?” ”

Zhou Jinbei looked out of the window and did not say anything.

“Zhou Xiang sighed, “Jinbei, can you even say that I’m begging you? Go and apologize to your parents! You’ve also angered them this time. Otherwise, they definitely wouldn’t have gone so far!” If there was no other way, who would be willing to do such an extreme thing? ”

“Actually, Zhou Xiang could somewhat understand Zhou Zuolong. ”

“Zhou Jinbei turned to look at Zhou xiang, “Sis, it was you who indulged them and tolerated them. That’s why they became like this! Can’t You Be Tough?” ”

“”Jinbei, those are our parents!”If there were no parents, would there be them? ”

“Zhou Jinbei said, “But they are also the murderers who killed Mom! If there was no mom, would there be us?” ”

“”Jinbei, Dad loves mom so much. Even if mom betrayed him, he would never abandon mom. He would never kill Mom!”Zhou Xiang trusted Zhou Zuolong very much, if Zhou Zuolong really did not have any feelings for Zhou Jinbei, he would not have performed a vasectomy for Wu Lan. ”

What kind of man would go to such lengths for a woman’s ancestral home?

But Zhou Zuolong had done it!

He had no regrets.

It was because of that vasectomy that Zhou Zuolong had not had a son or daughter with Xie Wanqiu for so many years.

“Every time she thought of this, Zhou Xiang’s heart ached for Zhou Zuolong. ”

She felt that Wu Lan had let Zhou Zuolong down.

“Zhou Jinbei understood Zhou Xiang’s personality. “SIS, I don’t want to argue with you right now.” ”

“Do you think I want to argue with you?”Zhou Xiang’s eyes were slightly red. “I don’t want to see Mother’s heart turn cold underground!”

“Wu Lan had sacrificed her life for love. Compared to Zhou Zuolong, she felt extremely guilty. ”

“Now that Zhou Jinbei had treated Zhou Jinbei and Zhou Zuolong in such a manner, not to mention Wu Lan, even her daughter would feel a chill down her spine when she saw it. ”

“”If you really don’t want mom to feel a chill down her spine underground, then listen to me. Don’t be deceived by them again!”Zhou Jinbei looked at Zhou Xiang. “Only by doing this will mom really feel a chill down her spine underground!” ”

“Seeing Zhou Jinbei like this, Zhou Xiang didn’t know what to say. ”

“Zhou Jinbei was usually a very shrewd person in life, but when he encountered this matter, he became muddle-headed. ”

He was truly a smart person who was muddle-headed for a lifetime.

He did not know when Zhou Jinbei would be able to see through the phenomenon and see the essence.

“”Jinbei, are you really not willing to go?” ”

“I’m Not Willing!”Zhou Jinbei’s attitude was firm.

Zhou Xiang sighed.

“Zhou Jinbei was not going to apologize, so Zhou Xiang had no choice but to go to the hospital herself. ”

“But when Zhou Xiang came to the hospital, she was dumbfounded. ”

Xie Wanqiu had been transferred to another hospital!

But the medical staff did not know which hospital she had been transferred to.

“Zhou Xiang was running around anxiously as she called Zheng Wanyin. “Wanyin, your grandmother has been transferred to another hospital?” ”

“”Yes, that’s right,”Zheng Wanyin said. ”

“Zhou Xiang continued, “Which hospital did your grandmother transfer to?” ”

“Zheng Wanyin lowered her voice and said, “Second aunt, grandfather is really angry this time. He did not allow me to say which hospital it was. I’m sorry...” ”

“”Wanyin,”Zhou Xiang said, “Just tell second aunt secretly. Don’t worry, second aunt will definitely not tell anyone else.” ”

“”Second aunt, it’s not that I don’t want to tell you, it’s just that I really can’t tell you...” ”

Zhou Xiang was about to say something when Zhou Zuolong’s voice came from the other end of the screen. “Yinyin!”

“Zheng wanyin said, “Second aunt, Grandpa is calling me, so I won’t say anything more to you.” ”

“After saying that, Zheng Wanyin hung up the phone. ”

“Zhou Xiang looked at the phone that had been hung up, his face full of melancholy. ”

“There were so many hospitals in Beijing. If Zheng Wanyin did not say, who knew which hospital Xie Wanqiu had transferred to! ”

“On the other end of the phone, Zhou Zuolong looked up at Zheng Wanyin. “The call was from Zhou Xiang?” ”

“Yes.”Zheng Wanyin nodded. “Second aunt asked me which hospital grandma transferred to.”

“Did you tell her?”Zhou Zuolong asked.

“No.”

“That’s good.”Zhou Zuolong was very satisfied with Zheng Wanyin’s performance.

Why did Zhou Xiang Call Zheng Wanyin?

It must be Zhou Jinbei’s intention.

“Zhou Jinbei came to the hospital to look for them, but found that they were gone, so he asked Zhou Xiang to call. ”

“Thinking of this, Zhou Zuolong’s face was full of joy. He knew that this little bastard, Zhou Jinbei, could not escape from his grasp! ”

“It had something to do with his early experiences, which led to Zhou Jinbei’s health not being too good, and he needed to go to the hospital for a regular check-up. ”

Today was the day Zhou Jinbei went to the hospital for a check-up.

“In order not to go to the hospital where Xie Wanqiu was, Zhou Jinbei specially went to the second hospital, which was very far away from the city hospital. ”

Zhou Jinbei had just arrived at the hospital hall when he was discovered by Xie Rongle.

“Although Xie Rongle had never seen Zhou Jinbei in person, she had seen Zhou Jinbei in a photo. ”

“In real life, Zhou Jinbei was no different from the photo. In fact, his temperament was even more pronounced. ”

This was a temperament that only the elites of society had.

It seemed that Xie Wanqiu was right. Zhou Jinbei had indeed come this time.

“For a moment, Xie Rongle’s heart raced. ”

“From now on, she would be Zhou Jinbei’s wife. ”

“Xie rongle turned around and went to the ward to hide the excitement in her heart. “Aunt, uncle, Zhou Jinbei has come.” ”
