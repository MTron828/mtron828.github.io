Was everyone blind?

“Zheng zikai smiled and said, “There’s another saying, ‘The word of a man is terrible.'”” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Seeing Zheng Zikai like this, Wang Zhishu shook her head helplessly.”

She felt that Zheng Zikai must have been possessed.

“Otherwise, he would not have blindly trusted ye Zhuo.”

“After Zhao Tong went on stage, in the blink of an eye, only the first place did not go on stage.”

“Seeing that she was about to go on stage to receive the award, Feng Xianxian’s palms were covered in a layer of sweat as she silently recited the acceptance speech in her heart.”

Everyone present today was the manager of the literary world. Even Li Zhentian was present.

She had to give a proper speech.

It made everyone’s eyes light up.

“Liu caiyi smiled and said, “Xianxian, don’t be nervous. Be Calm.””

“Feng Xianxian turned to look at Liu Caiyi and said, “Okay.””

“On the stage, the chief examiner adjusted the microphone, he smiled and said, “The most anticipated moment is coming! “I believe that everyone here is looking forward to today’s first place as much as I am! “I now announce that the first place in the assessment is also the first participant in the literary world to obtain a full score in the assessment for the past 15 years! Who Is She?””

“At this point, the chief examiner deliberately kept her in suspense. He looked around the stage, as if he wanted to say something, but he hesitated.”

“Seeing the chief examiner looking in her direction, Feng Xianxian became more and more nervous. Her heart was beating fast.”

Bang Bang Bang —

Feng Xianxian tried hard to calm herself down.

Wasn’t it just getting first place?

She had to be calm.

Calm.

She couldn’t lose her composure.

Today’s first place was just the beginning.

She would create more miracles in the literary world in the future!

“Seeing that the chief examiner was about to announce the first place, everyone held their breaths and looked at the Chief Examiner.”

“Under everyone’s expectant gazes, the chief examiner continued to announce, “Now, let’s welcome the first prize winner of the assessment competition, Ye Zhuo, to the stage!””

Ye Zao?

It was actually ye Zao!

“When these words were said, the audience fell silent. Everyone looked at each other and saw the doubt in each other’s eyes. They thought that they had misheard.”

It was not until ye Zao walked out of the audience seats that the crowd reacted.

They had not misheard.

The first place was really ye Zao!

How could ye Zao be first place?

Looking at ye Zao walking towards the stage.

Feng Xianxian’s face turned pale. She was ready to go on stage to receive the award.

But the final result was actually ye Zao.

The first place was ye Zao?

What right did ye Zao have?

What right did she have to get first place?

The first place should be hers.

Never in her wildest dreams did she expect that the first place was actually ye Zao!

What about her?

What was her place?

She couldn’t possibly not even enter the top ten?

It wasn’t just Feng Xianxian who was stunned.

Even Old Madam Lin and Liu Caiyi were stunned.

The expressions on these two people’s faces were each more interesting than the last.

Old Madam Lin looked at Ye Zhuo with a face full of disbelief.

Ye Zhuo got first place?

Then what about Feng Xianxian?

“Moreover, how did ye Zhuo get first place?”

Liu Caiyi furrowed her brows tightly.

She had always thought that the first place was Feng Qianxian.

She had never expected that Feng Qianxian would not even make it into the top ten.

This was not normal.

It was very abnormal.

“Feng Qianxian was quite talented, and with the answers she gave, how could she not even make it into the top ten?”

Liu Caiyi was puzzled.

“At this moment, ye Zhuo walked onto the stage.”

“The head examiner looked at the audience and said, “I believe that everyone is still very unfamiliar with this miss ye. Now, let me introduce her to everyone. This miss ye is Master Yu’s last disciple, Ye Zhuo, at the end of last year.””

“After he finished speaking, the head examiner handed the microphone to ye Zhuo and said, “Miss Ye, now, you will introduce yourself.””

“”Ye Zhuo, the mouth of a wooden leaf, burning brightly,”ye Zhuo said concisely.”

“Such a simple introduction, yet it revealed a domineering air that could not be ignored.”

“The chief examiner continued to ask, “Miss Ye, may I ask how you managed to hand in your paper two hours earlier and still get a full score?””

Ye Zao frowned slightly. “Is it very difficult to get a full score?”

Very... difficult?

Did you hear what he said?

“The chief examiner said, “Miss Ye, you may not know this, but this year’s examination paper is the most difficult one in the past fifteen years.””

“OH.”Ye Zhuo’s tone was indifferent.

Oh?

The most difficult examination paper in the past 15 years was exchanged for one of Ye Zhuo’s?

Everyone in the audience had looks of disbelief on their faces.

Liu Caiyi could not stand ye Zhuo’s arrogant face.

“She clearly did not have any real talent, yet she stood on the podium to receive the award.”

She must have cheated!

She had to expose ye Zhuo’s true face in front of everyone!

“With this thought in mind, Liu Caiyi immediately stood up. “Chief Li, I think this assessment is unfair.””
