“Sadness, sadness, disbelief, and all sorts of complicated emotions were mixed together, making it almost difficult for Chen Siyao to breathe. ”

“She originally thought that as long as Old Master Chen made a move, she would be able to smoothly become song Shiyu’s bride. ”

But reality gave him a heavy blow!

What was this!

What was this!

“Right at this moment, Chen Siyao suddenly thought of someone. ”

Miss Ye!

The door to her memories seemed to have been suddenly opened.

Miss ye and Mu Yourong were miscarried daughters.

“In other words, the little girl song Shiyu was looking for was very likely to be ye Zao. ”

“Most importantly, Chen Siyao clearly remembered that on the day of Old Madam Song’s funeral, Ye Zao had come to attend the funeral. ”

The song family was very respectful to ye Zao.

Could it be… Ye Zao?

“The person song Shiyu loved but couldn’t get, the person he wouldn’t marry for the rest of his life, was ye Zao? ”

“Thinking of this, Chen Siyao wiped her tears and immediately stood up from the ground. She made a call. “Hello, help me check if Shiyu has met Miss Ye in the past few days.” ”

“”Okay, please wait a moment.” ”

“It wasn’t a secret that ye Zao came to Nanhai, so not long after Chen Siyao made this call, a reply came from the other side. ”

Yes.

“Not only had ye Zhuo come to the South Sea, but he had also had dinner with song Shiyu. ”

There really weren’t many people who could make song Shiyu eat with them.

Was It really ye Zhuo?

“Chen Siyao narrowed her eyes, the expression in her eyes somewhat complicated. ”

“If it was that person, Ye Zhuo, Chen Siyao wouldn’t be convinced. ”

“Could it be that because ye Zhuo had saved song Shiyu once when he was young, song Shiyu couldn’t extricate himself from her? ”

She and song Shiyu had known each other since they were very young!

Why didn’t song Shiyu ever forget her.

Why was it so easy for ye Zhuo to get song Shiyu’s Love?

Chen Siyao bit her lip.

“However, from another perspective, she really couldn’t compare to ye Zhuo. ”

Ye Zhuo was very good-looking and was the first person in technology.

Fortunately.

“Fortunately, Ye Zhuo already had a fiancé. ”

“If ye Zao didn’t have a fiancé, then Chen Siyao would really have no hope at all. ”

“Thinking of this, Chen Siyao heaved a sigh of relief. She had seen ye Zao twice before, and with ye Zao’s wechat, it wouldn’t be difficult to ask ye Zao out. ”

“After thinking for a long time, Chen Siyao decided to ask ye Zao out. ”

She wanted ye Zao to help her.

“Chen Siyao edited a wechat message and sent it to Ye Zao. “Miss Ye, I’m Chen Siyao, a good friend that I’ve met from time to time. I heard that you’ve also come to Nanhai. I wonder if I can have the honor to treat you to a drink? “Yes.” ”CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“”If you have time, let’s meet at LM cafe at 12 noon tomorrow.”. “Okay.” ”

Ye Zhuo had a pretty good impression of Chen Siyao.

“In addition, Cen Shaoqing had been quite busy these past two days, so she didn’t have any special plans, so she agreed ”

“”Thank you for coming, Miss Ye.” ”

“The next day, at noon. ”

Ye Zhuo arrived punctually at the coffee shop he had arranged with Chen Siyao.

“”Over here, Miss Ye!”Chen Siyao waved her hand when she saw ye Zhuo. ”

“Ye Zhuo walked over. “Miss Chen, you’re here early.” ”

“Chen siyao smiled and said, “It just so happens that I have nothing to do.” ”

“After saying that, Chen Siyao handed the wine list to Ye Zhuo. “I don’t know what miss ye likes to drink. Please order it yourself. Don’t stand on ceremony.” ”

“Ye Zhuo had been a little angry recently, so he ordered a cup of small leaf kudingcha. ”

“Although it was a coffee shop, he could still order the traditional tea. ”

“Chen siyao continued, “I only found out that Miss Ye had come to Nanhai after hearing about it from Shi Yu. I wanted to treat you to a cup of tea.” ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled slightly, picked up the cup, and took a sip of tea. “I did meet brother song not long ago.” ”

“”A few days ago, I was talking to Shiyu about Miss Ye. I even said that Miss Ye is the girl I admire the most.”Actually, Chen Siyao had never talked to song Shiyu about Ye Zhuo. Everything she did was just to get close to Ye Zhuo. ”

“On the other hand, she wanted to indirectly tell ye Zhuo that her relationship with song Shiyu wasn’t ordinary. ”

“”Thank you.”Ye Zhuo took a sip of tea and thanked her. “Thank you for thinking so highly of me, Miss Chen.” ”

“Chen Siyao continued, “Miss Ye, you’re too modest. You have no idea how much my grandfather admires you. Just yesterday, he was comparing you to me.” ”

Chen Siyao wasn’t lying.

Old Master Chen really did admire ye Zhuo.

“Just then, the waiter brought over a plate of desserts. “The Peach Blossom Crispy Pastry you ordered.” ”

“Thank you.”Ye Zhuo thanked her.

“Chen Siyao glanced at ye Zhuo, weighing her words in her heart. ”
