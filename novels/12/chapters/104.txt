Chapter 105: 075: dinner, thousands of miles to thank you! 5

This caused Cen Shaoqing to think that girls’appetite was very small.

He did not expect that not all girls’appetite was so small.

If the four sisters knew that they did not dare to eat this or that every day on a diet, and that they were not as fit as those who ate and drank recklessly, they would probably be angered to death!

While ye Zhuo was eating dessert, Cen Shaoqing was sitting on a chair, holding a Buddhist bead in his hand.

Although no one said anything, the atmosphere was not awkward at all.

About ten minutes later, ye Zhuo finished his dessert and went to the bar to settle the bill. However, he was told that the bill had already been settled by Cen Shaoqing.

Ye Zhuo looked at Cen Shaoqing. “Mr. Cen, you said that I would treat you. Why did you go to settle the Bill?”

Cen Shaoqing smiled faintly and his slender fingers circled around the red Buddha beads, “It doesn’t matter who pays. If Miss Ye really feels bad, there’s a teahouse not far away. Miss ye can treat me to a drink! I’ll also ask Miss Ye for her chess skills!”

Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly. “You want to play chess with me?”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and his sexy Adam’s apple moved up and down. “En.”

Ye Zhuo took out his phone and looked at the time. It was not even 7 o’clock yet, so he nodded and said, “Okay.”

The two of them came to the door together. Cen Shaoqing opened the door of the passenger seat and invited Ye Zhuo in.

Ye Zhuo leaned in.

The car was very big and empty.

It was just like Cen Shaoqing’s whole person, so serious and meticulous.

After a while, they arrived at the entrance of the teahouse.

The two of them walked into the teahouse one after the other. Cen Shaoqing was a regular customer of the teahouse. As soon as he entered, he was warmly received by the manager. “Mr. Cen is here. This way, please.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

As the manager spoke, he secretly sized up ye Zhuo.

His eyes were filled with disbelief.

Usually, Cen Shaoqing would either come to drink tea alone or come with Li Qiandong.

He didn’t expect Cen Shaoqing to bring a girl over this time.

Moreover...

She was so beautiful.

He had long heard that Cen Shaoqing had a fiancée in Yunjing. Could this be Cen Shaoqing’s fiancée.

In a short period of time, the manager’s stomach was already filled with questions.

He came to Cen Shaoqing’s private private room.

The private room was decorated very simply and elegantly.

Everywhere they looked, they could see an antique-looking place.

Chess was placed on the table at the side.

“Please, Miss Ye.”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and sat down cross-legged.

Cen Shaoqing was sitting opposite her.

The manager brought over the golden melon tribute tea that had been brewed. The tea smoke curled up, blurring the faces of both of them.

In terms of chess skills, Cen Shaoqing was clearly not a match for ye Zhuo.

It had only been half a game, but Cen Shaoqing was already defeated.

If people who did not know saw this, they would think that Cen Shaoqing was deliberately going easy on him.

Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly. “I lost.”

Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “It’s normal to lose to dad. After all, as long as dad doesn’t want to lose, no one can win against Dad.”

Dad?

Ye Zhuo actually wanted to be his dad?

Cen Shaoqing looked at ye Zao in disbelief.

After saying that, ye Zao realized that he was not live streaming. He usually said that dad was used to it during live streaming, but he did not expect that he actually made a slip of the tongue in front of Cen Shaoqing.

Seeing Cen Shaoqing’s surprised look, ye Zao was slightly stunned.

Why was this Cen Shaoqing acting like an old man?

He did not even know about Dad’s joke.

“Mr. Cen doesn’t usually go online? And he doesn’t watch live broadcasts?”

Seeing the disdain in ye Zhuo’s eyes, Cen Shaoqing coughed lightly and changed the topic. “If Miss Ye were me, what would have happened?”

“Of course it would have happened this way!”Ye Zhuo picked up the black piece and placed it to the side, “It’s said that you lose a pawn to protect the cart, but that’s not entirely true. Sometimes, a small pawn can easily change the game and break the game! For example, this! Life is like chess, chess is like life, just like we can’t look down on anyone.”

The chessboard that had been settled suddenly became bright at this moment!

Cen Shaoqing’s eyes lit up. He also picked up a stone and placed it beside ye Zhuo’s hand. “This is what I should do next. If your cart comes, my cannon will eat your cart!”

“Mr. Cen, do you think you’ve won just like that?”Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly.

“What else?”Cen Shaoqing stared at the chessboard intently.

Could it be that ye Zao still had a backup plan?

Ye Zao smiled slightly. “If you eat my car, my horse will become a general! Mr. Cen, do you know what this is called?”

Cen Shaoqing did not expect ye Zao to really have a backup plan.

This is too incredible!
