He was simply an ingrate!

“Ye Zao stood up from the swing. “Duan Duan, Dong Dong, Nuo Nuo, Yang Yang, Rui Rui, let’s go over there and play, Okay?” ”

“Okay.”

The five little guys followed behind ye Zao and ran away happily.

“In fact, children were the most intelligent. ”

They could tell the difference between good and bad.

They could feel that Feng Xianxian was trying to please them with a purpose.

But Ye Zao was different.

The smile on Ye Zao’s face came from the bottom of his heart. There was no pressure at all when he was with her.

Feng Xianxian looked at their backs and stomped her feet angrily.

“Xianxian.”

Aunt Zhang suddenly appeared behind Feng Xianxian.

“What’s Wrong?”Feng Xianxian was shocked by Aunt Zhang’s sudden appearance. “Why are you so elusive?”

“Mrs Zhang continued, “Miss Qianhua asked me to come to you.” ”

Feng Qianqian nodded. “I understand.”

9 pm.

Feng Qianhua suggested to leave.

“Old Madam Lin said, “Let Jin City send you and Qianqian off.” ”

Feng Qianhua did not say a word.

She indeed lacked the time to be alone with Lin Jin city.

“Lin Jin city directly rejected her. “I’m not free, Mom. You can find someone else! I’ll go back to the East Wing First!”With that, Lin Jin city turned around and left. He did not want to stay in the west wing for another minute. ”

“Looking at Lin Jincheng’s back, Old Mrs. Lin was a little angry. ”

Not being free was just an excuse.

Ye Shu probably didn’t allow him to send her off!

Ye Shu stretched his hand too far.

“Seeing that old Mrs. Lin was about to get angry, Feng Qianhua smiled and said, “A chauffeur will come to pick us up. Aunt Lin, I won’t trouble brother Jincheng.” ”

“”Then I’ll ask the chauffeur at home to send you off.”Old Mrs. Lin looked at Aunt Zhang. “Aunt Zhang, ask Xiao Li to send Qianhua and Xianxian back.” ”

“Okay.”Aunt Zhang nodded and sent Feng Qianhua and her daughter out.

It was dark outside.

“Feng Qianhua looked at the darkness in front of her. “Aunt Zhang, do you think my persistence is right or wrong?” ”

She had guarded Lin Jin city for nineteen years.

“In the end, she got nothing. ”

Feng Qianhua was a little afraid that she would get nothing out of it.

“Aunt Zhang quickened her pace and stood shoulder to shoulder with Feng Qianhua. “Of course it’s right. Qianhua, you’ve guarded it for nineteen years. Are you going to give up at such a critical moment?” ”

“Of course, Feng Qianhua didn’t want to give up. ”

“But now, Lin Jincheng only had ye Shu in his heart. ”

He didn’t give her a chance at all.

“Aunt Zhang lowered her voice and continued, “Lin Jincheng and ye Shu still sleep on separate beds.” ”

“Sleep on separate beds?”Feng Qianhua’s eyes lit up. “Really?”

“”Absolutely.”Aunt Zhang nodded. “So, you mustn’t give up at such a critical moment.” ”

The depression in Feng Qianhua’s eyes disappeared instantly.

“”Thank you, Aunt Zhang.” ”

“If the relationship between Lin Jincheng and Ye Shu was so deep, why would they still sleep in separate beds? ”

This meant that the love between them had long passed its expiration date.

It was just a show.

“After all, Ye Shu had given birth to a son and a daughter for Lin Jincheng. ”

It was normal for Lin Jincheng to be grateful to her.

“Thinking of this, Feng Qianhua was full of confidence in herself again. ”

One day.

“She would kick ye Shu, this shameless mistress, out of the Lin family. ”

“Aunt Zhang continued, “Xianxian just won third place in the science and technology competition. The old lady was very happy and even asked her sons and families to send someone to attend Xianxian’s award ceremony. This shows that the old lady has already treated Xianxian as her biological granddaughter.” ”

“How can ye Zhuo compare to Xianxian?”

The pride in Feng Qianhua’s eyes became more obvious. “Aunt Lin really did this?”

“”Of course, I heard it for real.”Aunt Zhang continued, “It’s not easy to get the third-class award in the science and Technology competition. Xianxian has brought glory to the Lin Family!”! Do you think the old lady would be unhappy? If it were that little b * Tch Ye Zhuo, would she be able to get the third-class prize? I’m afraid she wouldn’t even be able to enter the science and Technology World!” ”

Ye Zhuo couldn’t compare to Feng Xianxian at all.

“After all, Feng Xianxian grew up with all kinds of training class presidents. She was proficient in all kinds of music, chess, calligraphy, and painting. ”

Could Ye Zhuo do it?

“Other than playing the piano, he didn’t know anything else. ”

“Hearing Aunt Zhang’s words, Feng Xianxian raised her shoulders. ”

She knew that no one could take away her position as the eldest daughter of the Lin family.

“Only ye Zao had taken it away now, and he would return it to her in the future. ”

“At this moment, ”

a black car stopped in front of the mother and daughter.

Feng Qianhua turned to look at Aunt Zhang. “I’ll go back first. You should go back too. The weather has been getting colder these few days. Please keep warm at night.”

Aunt Zhang nodded.

Feng Qianhua and Feng Xianxian got into the car.

Aunt Zhang watched the black car disappear into the night before she turned to leave.
