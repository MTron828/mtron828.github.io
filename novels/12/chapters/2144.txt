“”It’s pretty good,”Cen Yuying said. ”

“That’s good.”

Cen Haifeng walked up to Cen Shaoqing again. “Shaoqing.”

Cen Shaoqing did not say a word and just looked at Cen Haifeng.

“Cen Haifeng also felt ashamed, he continued, “In the blink of an eye, all of you have grown up. It’s father who has let you down. Father did not participate in your growth and did not fulfill the responsibility of a father. I have left all of You When you needed me the most. I’m sorry... “...”. Although he knew that the words ‘sorry’were powerless.., it was also very boring, but at this moment, other than being sorry, Cen Haifeng did not know what else to say. ”

“Cen Yuying sighed, she stood up and said, “Father, I know your difficulties, but all these years, grandmother and mother have suffered for real. When you left back then, all those people came to step on us. Do you know how difficult it was during that period of time? Mom was crying every day... ... .. ”

“Cen Haifeng was bitter, but Zhou Xiang was even more bitter than him. ”

“”Okay, young girl, the matter has passed. Let It Pass,”Zhou Xiang continued. ”

“The past went with the wind. In the days to come, she would live as before, not for anyone but herself. ” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Old Mrs. Cen sighed in her heart. She knew very well that there was no future for Zhou Xiang and Cen Haifeng. She turned to CEN Haifeng and said, “We are all tired. Make some arrangements. We need to rest.” ”

“”Okay.”Cen Haifeng nodded. “I’ve already arranged the rooms. Mom, come with me.” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen walked to Zhou Xiang’s side and held her hand. “Xiangxiang, no matter what choice you make, Mom will support you. From now on, you’ll Be Mom’s only daughter.” ”

“They had been mother-in-law and daughter-in-law for so many years. Even if they couldn’t be mother-in-law, they could still be mother and daughter. ”

“”Mom, thank you.” ”

“What nonsense are you saying?”

“After settling down in a place to rest, old Mrs. Cen went to Cen Haifeng. “Let me ask you, where is that sparrow? Why didn’t I see her?” ”

“Sparrow? What Sparrow?”Cen Haifeng was stunned.

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “It’s that Duanmu Sparrow!” ”

“”You said it was Duanmu Fenghuang, right?”CEN Haifeng continued, “She was locked up.” ”

“Locked up? What’s going on?”Old Mrs. Cen asked.

Cen Haifeng did not hide the truth and told old Mrs. Cen about the whole process.

“Hearing this, old Mrs. Cen frowned and snorted coldly, “I knew this Duanmu Sparrow was not a good person! She actually wanted to harm Xiangxiang! This kind of person should be locked up in prison for life! What kind of thing is that? A mistress still wants to enter the house!” ”

“After saying that, old Mrs. Cen continued, “This is the only thing that you did well!” ”

“If Cen Haifeng allowed Duanmu Fenfei to do nothing, it would be extremely annoying! ”

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Let me tell you, there is no chance between you and Xiang Xiang in the future! Don’t think about it anymore. Xiang Xiang forgiving you is already a virtue of your past life. “In the future, you just have to take care of Xiang Xiang. Don’t let her get hurt again.” ”

“”Okay.”Cen Haifeng nodded. “Mom, I know.” ”

Old Mrs. Cen sighed. “Why didn’t you think of this earlier? But you’re better than your father. At least you remembered! What about him? I didn’t even get a chance to say sorry to him!”

“She was old, so she didn’t want to be too calculative. ”

“But when she thought of it again, she felt a little sad. ”

She thought that her love was great and that it was great that she had stayed by the Cen family’s old master’s side all her life without getting married. But it was all bullshit!

“CEN Haifeng continued, “When I came, father’s spirit was already not very good.” ”

“There had always been a very strange phenomenon in the General Alliance. In the past, the General Alliance had never lasted past the age of fifty-five. ”

The reason why he was still fine until now was that the great elder and the National Master had found a panacea to hang on to. They were all waiting for Cen Shaoqing to get married and have children.

“However, the CEN family had a different Cen Shaoqing’s generation. Cen Shaoqing actually saw through the secular world and wanted to become a monk. ”

“During that time, the ones who were anxious were not only old Mrs. Cen and Zhou Xiang, but also the great elder and the National Master of the General Alliance. ”

“If not, with Cen Haifeng’s condition, how could he have lasted until now? ”

“Old Mrs. Cen raised her hand. “I don’t want to hear about him now. Anyway, he died decades ago. I’m tired, I need to go back and rest. Remember what I said.” ”

“Okay.”Cen Haifeng nodded.

The next morning.

“Old Mrs. Cen woke up early in the morning. According to the servant’s guidance, she came to the backyard to dance with her sword. ”

“The plants in the s galaxy were very different from those on Earth. Soon, old Mrs. Cen’s gaze was attracted by these strange plants. ”

“At this moment, a pleasant voice sounded from behind her, “Old Mrs. Cen, You’re exercising.” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen raised her head, “Who are you?” ”

“Duanmu Fengyu said with a smile, “Old Mrs. Cen, I’m Duanmu Fengyu. Oh right, you haven’t had breakfast yet, right? I specially made the food on Earth for you. Have a taste.” ”

“In order to please Old Lady Cen, Duanmu Fengyu put in a lot of effort. Not only did he study the delicacies on Earth, but he also memorized Old Lady Cen’s preferences. ”

“Just like what Mrs. Duanmu said, Old Lady Cen was not a difficult old lady to get along with. ”

“Otherwise, she would not be so satisfied with ye Zhuo. ”

“Her status was many times more honorable than ye Zhuo’s. If she lowered her status to please this pious old lady, the old lady would definitely like her very much. ”

“What Did You Say Your Name Was?”

“Duanmu Fengyu.”

“”What? Your Name Is Duanmu Sparrow?”Old Mrs. Cen scratched her head and said with a speechless expression, “Why is there another sparrow after a sparrow has just been locked up?” ”

“Duanmu Fengyu’s face turned green, but she had no choice but to maintain the smile on the corner of her mouth. “Old Mrs. Cen, you have misheard that my name is Duanmu Fengyu. I am the Phoenix’s Phoenix, and I share the concerns of the people.” ”

She was not a sparrow.

This old devout woman was simply too vicious.

“Old Madam Cen ignored Duanmu Fengyu and turned to look at the servant beside her. “Xiao Tao, let me ask you a question.” ”

“”Old Madam, please ask.” ”

“Old madam CEN continued, “Do you know that sparrows turn into Phoenixes?” ”

“Hearing this, Xiao Tao nodded in embarrassment. ”

“Old Madam Cen turned to look at Duanmu Fengyu, “See, I told you it was a sparrow, but you still refused to admit it! It’s just that the names given by your Duanmu family are really funny. It’s not enough to have a sparrow that wants to fly on a branch and become a Phoenix, but you have to have another one!” ”
