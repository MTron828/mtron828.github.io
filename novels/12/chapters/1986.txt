Zhou Xiang forced a smile. “I’m fine.”

“Why are Your Eyes Red?”Old Mrs. Cen frowned. “Who bullied you? Tell me! I’m going to fight with her!”

“When she said the last sentence, Old Mrs. Cen rolled up her sleeves, looking like she was going to fight. ”

Who Dared to bully her daughter-in-law!

She was too bold!

“”Mom, I’m really fine.”Zhou xiang smiled and said, “The wind blew the sand into my eyes! I’m Going Upstairs First!” ”

“Afraid that the old lady would notice something, Zhou Xiang immediately went upstairs. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen looked at Zhou Xiang’s back and turned to look at Cen Shaoqing. “Fifth girl, What’s wrong with your mom!” ”

Fifth Girl...

Cen Shaoqing’s hand that was twirling the Buddha beads paused.

“At first, he was very resistant to this nickname, but after ye Zhuo called him many times, he did not care so much. Just as he was about to speak.., old Mrs. Cen continued, “Don’t tell me that the wind blew the sand into my eyes! What sand! Do I look like a Fool to you, your grandmother?” ”

What era was this? Why was she still learning the tricks from the love drama.

“”Because of my dad,”Cen Shaoqing replied. ”

Old Mrs. Cen frowned slightly. “What happened?”

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “We found some parts of the shipwreck today.” ”

“”What?”Old Mrs. Cen asked, “Where was it found?” ”

Cen Shaoqing answered truthfully.

Old Mrs. Cen sighed.

“”Before we found the remains, your mother had a spiritual sustenance and thought that your father was still alive.”Old Mrs. Cen sighed, “Now that the remains have been found, your mother’s last spiritual sustenance has also disappeared.” ”

“Although Old Mrs. Cen and Zhou Xiang were not biological mother and daughter, their relationship was better than that of biological mother and daughter. Therefore, old Mrs. Cen also understood Zhou Xiang very well. ”

“After saying this, old Mrs. Cen continued, “After so many years, your mother should have let it go a long time ago. However, she is a stubborn person with deep feelings... It’s your father who has let her down.” ”

“When Cen Haifeng had his accident, Zhou Xiang was only in her twenties. ”

“If it had been anyone else, they might not have been able to keep watch. ”

“However, Zhou Xiang managed to keep watch. ”

“What about your sister?”Old Mrs. Cen continued to ask.

“Which sister are you referring to?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“Yuying.”

“CEN Shaoqing said, “Eldest sister went to country Y and hasn’t returned yet.” ”

“What about Yueya and Yueying?”Old Mrs. Cen continued to ask.

“Second sister and third sister went on a business trip.”

“Hearing this, old Mrs. Cen frowned slightly. “These girls usually run back and forth when they are not needed. Now that they are needed, they are nowhere to be seen! They are really annoying!”Cen Shaoqing was a boy after all, it was more or less inappropriate to ask him to comfort Zhou Xiang. ”

There was a saying that a child avoided his mother while a daughter avoided her father.

“”Forget it, I’ll go,”old Mrs. Cen said. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen was afraid that she would comfort Zhou Xiang, so she hugged her head and cried together with Zhou Xiang. ”

This was because her fate was very similar to Zhou Xiang’s.

Old Cen also died young.

“However, she was a little luckier than Zhou Xiang. ”

“When Old Cen left, she was 36 years old. ”

“Standing in front of Zhou Xiang’s door, Old Mrs. Cen took a deep breath, smiled, and patted her chest. “Don’t Cry, Don’t Cry! Baby, you’re the fattest!” ”

“At this point, old Mrs. Cen seemed to realize something and immediately changed her words. “Ah! No, I’m not fat! I should be the best! Baby, you’re the Best!” ”

“After cheering herself on, Old Mrs. Cen reached out and knocked on the door. ”

“”Xiang Xiang, Xiang Xiang.” ”

“Hearing Old Mrs. Cen’s voice, Zhou Xiang came back to his senses and immediately wiped the tears off his face. He turned around and looked in the direction of the door, “Mom, is that you?” ”

“”It’s me,”old Mrs. Cen answered. ”

“Zhou xiang smiled, “Mom, come in.” ”

“The next second, Zhou Xiang pushed the door open and entered. ”

“”Xiang Xiang, are you okay?”Old Mrs. Cen walked to Zhou Xiang’s side. ”

“Zhou xiang smiled and said, “I’m fine.” ” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Old Mrs. Cen sat down and reached out to touch Zhou Xiang’s face, she said with some heartache, “You still say you’re fine! Your eyes are swollen from crying! Xiang Xiang, it’s been so many years since the incident, there’s nothing to cry about! Besides, that heartless brat left his entire family just like that, what’s there to cry about! Don’t Cry! It’s not worth it for such a person!” ”

“Mom!”Zhou Xiang couldn’t help but hug old Mrs. Cen and burst into tears.

“Old Mrs. Cen patted Zhou Xiang’s back. “Good child, Mom knows that you feel wronged. Mom knows...” ”
