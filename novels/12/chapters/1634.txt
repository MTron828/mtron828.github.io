Translator: 549690339

Landing on Neptune was easier said than done!

“Old Xu smiled and said, “That’s why it’s good to hear it! It’s not right to be serious!” ”

“”What if Dr. YC really landed on Neptune?”Pan Tao continued to ask, “Even country C can land on the Moon, why can’t China Land on Neptune?” ”

“”The Moon is only 400,000 kilometers away from Earth, and Neptune is 4.5 billion kilometers away from Earth. Do you think this can be compared?”Lao Xu asked. ”

“Pan Tao calculated with his fingers and was shocked. “According to the speed of humans flying to the moon, it will take at least 200 years for humans to go to Neptune?” ”

“Yes.”Lao Xu nodded. “Do you still think that YC can land on Neptune Now?”

Pan Tao immediately shook his head.

Over here.

Ye Sen looked at the phone that was hung up and frowned slightly. He picked up his phone again and replayed the call.

“Old Xu Saw Ye Sen’s number and looked at Pan Tao with a smile. “Look, it’s calling again!” ”

“Pan Tao also smiled. “It seems that CEO ye really cares about you. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have called again and again!” ”

Old Xu picked up the call. “CEO Ye.”

“Ye Sen’s voice came from the other end of the phone again, “Old Xu! Don’t ignore what I said. If you miss today, it’ll be too late for you to get rid of it tomorrow! Old Xu, you must make good use of this opportunity!” ”

“As a good friend, Ye Sen really did not want to see Old Xu’s investment fail. ”

“Old Xu smiled and said, “President Ye, I won’t play dumb with you. To tell you the truth, your niece will never land on Neptune. Mankind will never realize the freedom of diamonds! President Ye, don’t blame me for not believing you. It’s just that such a statement is too funny. Don’t talk about me. Go outside and ASK. How many people will believe that your niece can land on Neptune?” ”

“”My eldest niece told me very clearly that she will definitely land on Neptune! I believe in my niece. Old Xu, please believe in me too!” ”

“Old Xu continued, “President Ye, I appreciate your kindness! Don’t worry, even if your niece really lands on Neptune and realizes the diamond freedom of the people, I will not blame you! I will only blame myself for not seizing the opportunity!” ”

“Since he had already said this much, there was no point in saying anything else. Ye Sen continued, “Alright, Old Xu, in that case, I’ll hang up first. You think about it carefully.” ”

“”Okay, I’ll hang up!”Old Xu hung up the phone. ”

“Pan Tao smiled and said, “This president ye is really funny. He actually has a phone on the left and a phone on the right. Tell me, does he like your batch of goods?” ”

“Hearing this, Old Xu narrowed his eyes, “If you didn’t say it, I wouldn’t have thought of it. Now that you mention it, I do remember! “It must be so. It’s not easy to find a source of diamonds these days. He’s in a hurry to get me to sell. Perhaps he wants to find someone to buy my diamonds at a low price! “I really didn’t expect ye Sen to be such a person! “To think that I have always treated him as a good friend. I didn’t expect him to treat me like this!” ”

Old Xu was a little angry!

He and Ye Sen were the kind of people who wouldn’t know each other unless they fought. He didn’t expect ye Sen to actually want to scheme against him.

“Fortunately, he was smart! ”

“Otherwise, he would have been schemed against by Ye Sen! ”

“Pan Tao continued, “I think you’d better not deal with such people in the future! Otherwise, you won’t even know when you’ve been schemed against!” ”

Old Xu nodded. “You’re right.”

“After hanging up, Ye Sen turned on his computer and continued to argue with others. ”

At the same time.

At the scene of the aircraft carrier’s lift-off ceremony.

“Five minutes later, Tang Xue came back with something. ”

“David saw Tang Xue and asked impatiently, “How is it? Did you get the Thing?” ”

“Tang Xue nodded and handed the thing to David. “Look, is this it?” ”

“David took the box from Tang Xue and opened it. In the middle of the box, there was a round pellet the size of a pill. ”

“Although it did not look big, its power could not be ignored. ”

Such a small nuclear bomb could destroy a small island in an instant.

The title of Country C’s country of weapons was not for nothing.

“David looked at Tang Xue and said, “Miss Tang, don’t worry. Dr. Cara will definitely not mistreat you!” ”

“Thank you.”Tang Xue bowed to David.

“If it were any other time, she might have avoided it. ” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“After all, this was the CEN base in China. ”

“But now, Tang Xue did not need to avoid it at all. ”

“After all, the CEN base was about to change its name. In the future, C country and the other six countries would be the owners of the CEN base. Everyone in the CEN base had to listen to Dr. Cara. ”
