“Chapter 1148: 249: face-smacking Zhao Xueyin, extremely domineering! 4”

Translator: 549690339

“After officer Wang and the others left, only ye Zhuo and the others were left in the ward. ”

“Auntie Wang hurriedly introduced them to Su Qiang. “Her father, this is President Ye.” ”

“”President Ye, thank you!”Su Qiang stood up and bowed to ye Zhuo. ”

“Traditional Chinese medicine emphasizes the importance of medical affinity. It’s also our fate to be able to cure your illness by chance. You Don’t have to be so polite.”

“For example, Granny Zhou did not have any medical fate with her. ”

...

“When he learned that Zhao Xueyin had been taken away by the police, Father Zhao was furious. ”

Idiot!

What an idiot.

Father Zhao did not expect that Zhao Xueyin would fall into ye Zao’s hands again and again.

“After finding many connections and paying a fine, father Zhao finally brought Zhao Xueyin out of the detention center ”

Zhao Xueyin followed behind Father Zhao without saying a word.

“Father Zhao was a person who cared a lot about his reputation. Outside, he would not easily lose his temper. ”

“When he returned home, he would face a storm in front of Zhao Xueyin. ”

Zhao Xueyin did not want to see this result either.

How could she have thought that Ma Jiayue would make a mistake.

She also did not think that ye Zao had such superb medical skills.

All of this was something that she did not expect.

PA —

The door was slammed shut.

The atmosphere in the car was heavy and depressing.

It was almost impossible to breathe.

Father Zhao sat in the front seat.

Zhao Xueyin sat in the back seat.

They did not speak the whole way.

The car was very fast.

“After about half an hour, they arrived at the Zhao family’s villa. ”

Zhao Xueyin followed Father Zhao just like that.

They had just entered the house.

PA —

A complete vase fell in front of Zhao Xueyin just like that.

Fragments scattered all over the ground.

The vase almost brushed past Zhao Xueyin’s forehead.

Almost.

Almost!

“Father Zhao’s grumpy voice came from the air, “Tell me! How many times has this been?” ”

“Zhao Xueyin’s lips paused, but she did not say anything. Her face was deathly pale. ”

This was the third time since ye Zao returned.

“First, he fired Sun Yiran. ”

“Then, he set up plan C to embarrass Zhao Xueyin in public. ”

“And now, he set Zhao Xueyin up to enter the detention center! ”

“”Dad, I’m sorry.”After a long while, Zhao Xueyin finally squeezed out these words from between her teeth. ”

“”Sorry? Did I come to hear you say sorry? If sorry was useful, would you still need to enter the detention center today?”Speaking up to this point.., father Zhao pointed at his face and said, “Do you know that my old face is almost ruined by you!” ”

The most important thing in a wealthy family was face.

“But today, Zhao Xueyin was actually locked up in the detention center! ”

“In order to find connections to bail Zhao Xueyin out, father Zhao begged his grandfather and grandmother to make it known to everyone. ”

Zhao Xueyin was also very upset.

“If she had known that things would turn out like this, she definitely wouldn’t have believed Ma Jiayue’s words. ”

“But now, it was useless to say anything! ”

“”Dad, I also didn’t know that things would turn out like this.”Zhao Xueyin raised her head to look at Father Zhao. “It was second aunt who told me that Doctor Ye Zao had died. She asked me to call the police and bring them over...” ”

“Father Zhao continued, “What exactly are you thinking? Do you have a brain? If you had a brain at all, you wouldn’t have thrown yourself into the detention center!” ” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“If Zhao Xueyin had a brain at all, she wouldn’t have taken her surname just like Ma Jiayue said. ”

A dead doctor?

“If ye Zao really had a dead doctor, would she still be so calm? ”

Father Zhao was very worried now.

“He was worried that if ye Zao sat firmly in the position of president, he would compete with Zhao Xueyin for the position of first seat. ”

“Originally, Father Zhao didn’t think much of this little girl, Ye Zao. ”

“In his opinion, what kind of achievements could a little girl achieve? ”

“However, according to the current situation. ”

Ye Zhuo was much more outstanding than Zhao Xueyin.

“Otherwise, Zhao Xueyin would not have been cheated by ye Zhuo again and again. ”

Zhao Xueyin was only the acting chief of the Shunxi Financial Group.

The financial group was about to re-elect the chief.

“If this situation continued,. ”

Zhao Xueyin would definitely be pushed out by Ye Zhuo.

“At that time, the Shunxi Financial Group would have a change of heart. ”

“Thinking of this, Father Zhao’s eyes were filled with worry. ”

Zhao Xueyin lowered her head.

She was indeed too rash in this matter

She should have investigated it clearly.

“However, the situation at that time was not in a hurry for her to investigate it clearly... ”

Because she was afraid that ye Zhuo would use the money to bribe sister-in-law Wang.

But wasn’t she doing this for the sake of the financial group?

She also wanted to drive ye Zhuo away.

She did not expect to be set up by Ye Zhuo instead.

Ye Zhuo did it on purpose!

Father Zhao did not understand the situation at all and only knew to scold her. Was it because she was not a boy?

“She had already suffered a bellyful of anger in the detention center today. Now that she was back, she had to suffer father Zhao’s anger! ”
