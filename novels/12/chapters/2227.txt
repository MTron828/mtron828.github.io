Translator: 549690339

Bai Jingshu was stunned.

“As if she did not expect that everyone was familiar with each other, she smiled and nodded. “Miss Shi, Mr. Lin. I am Bai Jingshu, white in color. I Am Jingshu, who is waiting for me in the corner of the city.” ”

“Shi Qingcheng shook hands with Bai Jingshu. “Shi Qingcheng, time is of the essence.” ”

“Then, Lin Ze extended his hand to Bai Jingshu. “Lin Ze, the Twin Woods Forest, the one who has helped each other.” ”

Bai Jingshu reached out her hand to hold Lin Ze’s hand.

“Lin Ze was about 1.8 meters tall. Standing in front of Bai Jingshu, he looked like a tall ancient tree. He stood alone and his aura was like an orchid, blocking out the sunlight above Bai Jingshu’s head. ”

Bai Jingshu had to raise her head to see his face.

“After a while, ye Han continued, “Miss Bai, are you here to do archeology again?” ”

Bai Jingshu nodded and smiled. “The capital city is a very charming city. I really like it here.”

“”Do you need us to come along?”Ye Han continued, “Today, My Brother is a tour guide. He grew up in the capital city and is very familiar with it.” ”

“Bai Jingshu continued, “Thank you. I still have to go to other places in a while, so I won’t trouble you guys.” ”

“”Alright then. My girlfriend and I will be in the capital during this period of time. If you need anything, you can contact me,”ye Han said. ”

“”Alright, thank you.”Bai Jingshu continued, “Then I’ll go over there first. Goodbye, everyone.” ”

“Take care.”

“Looking at Bai Jingshu’s back view, Shi Qingcheng said, “What’s the relationship between Bai Jingshu and Bai Mo?” ”

“The Bai family members had good genes. Although Bai Mo was petite, her facial features were really exquisite. This Bai Jingshu was even more exquisite than Bai Mo.. ”

“She smiled sweetly, her beautiful eyes filled with anticipation. ” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“”They’re cousins,”ye Han replied. ”

“Shi Qingcheng asked curiously, “Bai Mo is the older sister?” ”

“Ye Han shook his head. “No, Bai Mo is the younger sister.” ”

“Shi Qingcheng continued, “Then why didn’t you introduce Bai Jingshu to brother Ze? I think Bai Jingshu is much easier to get along with than Bai Mo. .” ”

Although Bai Mo looked at everyone with a smile on her face...

But her smile hid the sharpest blade.

“Ye Han explained, “I’m not that close to Bai Jingshu. We just know each other.” ”

He and Bai Mo could be considered good friends.

“”I see.”Shi Qingcheng nodded. She looked at Lin Ze and continued, “Brother Ze, what do you think of Bai Jingshu? If you like her, I can become good friends with her and then set you two up.” ”

“Just Like Ye Han, Shi Qingcheng also had the heart of a matchmaker. ”

“Lin Ze chuckled. “Thank you, but there’s no need for that. I’m not thinking about personal matters for the time being.” ”

“”Really, there’s no need for that?”Shi Qingcheng continued, “Brother Ze, we’re all on the same side. Don’t stand on ceremony.” ”

“”There’s really no need,”Lin ze said. ”

“Shi Qingcheng turned to look at ye Han and asked, “What’s Bai Jingshu like? I heard from you that she’s coming to Earth for archeology. Could it be that she comes here often?” ”

“”Yes.”Ye Han nodded and continued, “Bai Jingshu is different from the others. She likes to study the ancient cultures on Earth. She spends two-thirds of her time on Earth every year.” ”

“In the S Galaxy, earth was the lowest civilization and the people on Earth were also the lowest class of people. Bai Jingshu did the opposite. She liked to study the culture on Earth, so she naturally became the outlier in everyone’s eyes. ”

“”I really couldn’t tell that Bai Jingshu actually liked Earth so much,”Shi Qingcheng Sighed. ”

“After saying that, Shi Qingcheng asked, “Then what’s her personality like?” ”

“Ye Han shook his head. “I’m not too sure. She’s different from Bai Mo and doesn’t like to interact with people. In any case, she’s quite isolated. I rarely hear Bai Mo talk about Bai Jingshu.”Bai Jingshu’s parents didn’t have a high status in the Bai family, in addition, Bai Jingshu was not a particularly outstanding junior, so Bai Jingshu was a dispensable person in the Bai family. ”

“After saying that, ye Han continued, “I see that you’re quite interested in her?” ”

“Shi Qingcheng said, “Am I not concerned about brother Ze? Actually, I really think that Bai Jingshu is quite good.” ”

“Lin Ze rubbed his nose. “Thank you, but I really don’t want to think about this right now.” ”

“”This kind of thing isn’t something that you can just think about and not think about.”Shi Qingcheng continued, “When fate comes, even if you don’t want to think about it, you’ll have to kneel down and sing ‘conquer’.” ”

“”I won’t,”Lin ze said very calmly. ”

“”This isn’t something that you can just say you won’t.”Shi Qingcheng narrowed her eyes and turned to look at Lin Ze. “Brother Ze, you haven’t been in a relationship before, right?” ”
