“”It has nothing to do with Miss Ye. I’m not good enough,”song Chenyu said.”

“”How is it not related?”Cen Yuyan frowned slightly, “Ye Zhuo is a scheming white lotus. If she didn’t sow discord in front of Lu Xiu, I wouldn’t have such a big misunderstanding of you! I even caused you to be injured! “Although my fifth brother is a shrewd person, he is still a man. A man’s thoughts are far less meticulous than a woman’s! “I think my fifth brother was deceived by ye Zhuo’s White Lotus appearance! “Otherwise, how could he have coaxed my fifth brother to publicly admit her identity in front of so many media outlets!””

“I think that photo was exposed by her own people!”

“”My fifth brother is just too stupid. He couldn’t even see through such tricks and even held her in his hands. If it were me, I would have dumped her long ago!””

Cen Yuyan was filled with anger when she thought of this matter.

The person standing beside Cen Shaoqing should have been song Chenyu.

“However, he was intercepted by Ye Zhuo.”

“That was fine, but Song Chenyu was a Buddhist and did not want to compete with Ye Zhuo.” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“If song Chenyu had used some tricks, even a little, he would not have ended up in this situation.”

“One had to know that when Song Chenyu met Cen Shaoqing, Ye Zao was nowhere to be found!”

“Song Chenyu smiled. “Yuyan, don’t say that. You and Miss ye are going to be a family in the future. If you always have a problem with Miss Ye, how are you going to get along in the future?””

“Cen Yuyan hugged song Chenyu’s arm. “If you want to talk about sister-in-law, I only acknowledge you as my sister-in-law! Ye Zhuo won’t enter my eyes!””

Ye Zhuo wanted to become a family with her?

In her dreams.

She would never agree to that!

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “Fate is determined by heaven, and it’s not up to you to decide. Right, why don’t we go out for a walk? I’ve been staying at home for quite a few days!””

“Okay.”Cen Yuyan nodded.

Song Chenyu put on some makeup and a mask and went out with Cen Yuyan.

“In order not to highlight the mask on song Chenyu’s face, Cen Yuyan also put on a mask.”

The two first bought clothes and then a bunch of skincare products.

“Cen Yuyan had no financial source now, so she used song Chenyu’s card.”

“”Chenyu, don’t worry. When I have money, I will return this money to you immediately.””

“Song Chenyu said speechlessly, “Is there a need to be so distant between us?””

“Cen Yuyan hugged song Chenyu. “Chenyu, thank you.””

“Idiot.”Song Chenyu patted Cen Yuyan.

“This scene happened to be seen by Old Mrs. Cen, who was shopping.”

Old Mrs. Cen narrowed her eyes and took off the sunglasses on her face. She turned to look at Zhou Xiang beside her. “Do you think that’s the fourth girl?”

Zhou Xiang looked up and nodded. “It’s her.”

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Who’s the person beside her?””

“Zhou Xiang carefully identified her and continued, “It seems to be song Chenyu.””

Song Chenyu?

“Upon hearing this name, Old Madam Cen could not remain calm.”

Idiot!

He was simply an idiot.

“He had already been deceived by song Chenyu to such an extent, and now he was still fooling around with song Chenyu.”

Was he brainless?

“Old Madam Cen continued, “Xiang Xiang, go and call that girl over for me.””

“Alright.”Zhou Xiang nodded and walked over to call for her.

“When she saw Zhou Xiang, Cen Yuyan said in surprise, “Mom?””

“Song Chenyu politely said, “Auntie.””

Zhou Xiang nodded at song Chenyu and then looked at Cen Yuyan. “Your grandmother is here too. Come with me.”

Cen Yuyan followed Zhou Xiang’s footsteps.

“When she saw Cen Yuyan, old Mrs. Cen’s expression was not very good, but she did not scold her. She only said, “Why are you still with that fish?””

“Cen Yuyan said, “I misunderstood Chenyu the last time. Actually, Chenyu is a very good girl!””

“”Do you want me to say that you’re Stupid? Or do you want me to say something good about you?”Old Mrs. Cen hated that she had failed to live up to her expectations. “Hearing is believing, seeing is believing. Not only did you see it with your own eyes, but you also heard it with your own eyes. How could you be deceived by her?””

“”Chenyu didn’t lie to me. There was indeed a misunderstanding about this matter.”Seeing that old Mrs. Cen had such a deep opinion of Song Chenyu.., cen Yuyan continued, “Grandma, let me tell you the truth. Actually, the person who was truly scheming was ye Zhuo! The incident that night was also designed by Ye Zhuo. She almost caused me to misunderstand chenyu and even caused Chenyu to be injured!””
