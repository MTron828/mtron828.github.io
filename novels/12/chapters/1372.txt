“As his grandfather, what was wrong with him advocating his grandson’s marriage? ”

Was he going to let him watch helplessly as Cen Shaoqing was harmed by two women.

“Zhou Zuolong pointed at Zhou Xiang and said angrily, “Idiot, you’re an idiot! Letting Shaoqing get together with ye Zao will sooner or later harm Shaoqing and the entire Cen Family!” ”

“”It’s fine if Bai Tang has bad taste. After all, she’s old and it’s normal for her eyes to be blurry. But what about you? You’re my daughter! I, Zhou Zuolong’s daughter!” ”

Having a daughter like Zhou Xiang was simply embarrassing!

“Zhou Xiang only felt a buzzing sound in her ears. Her face was so painful that it was almost numb. In an instant, she felt as if she had returned to her childhood. ”

“Ever since her mother left, Zhou Zuolong had hit and scolded the siblings without any mercy. ”

“At that time, she would hide in bed and cry secretly. She would miss her mother and blame her mother at the same time. ”

“If her mother had not died, she would not be like this now. ”

“Of course, Zhou Zuolong had never told Zhou Xiang the true cause of Wu Lan’s death. ”

“Until now, Zhou Xiang still thought that Wu Lan had eloped with another man and died on the train tracks. ”

That’s right.

“Zhou Zuolong announced to the public that Wu Lan had eloped with a wild man. In the end, she failed to elope and died on the train tracks. ”

“Therefore, Zhou Xiang never dared to mention Wu Lan in front of Zhou Zuolong. ”

“Zhou Zuolong asked Zhou Xiang to change her name to Xie Wanqiu’s mother, so Zhou Xiang could only follow suit. ”

“”Old Man, don’t hit her anymore. We only have one daughter, Xiang!”Xie wanqiu took a step forward and hugged Zhou Zuolong’s arm. ”

Only Zhou Xiang had one daughter.

“If it wasn’t Zhou Xiang, would Xie Ying Die? ”

“If Xie Ying was Zhou Xiang today, Xie Ying would definitely not be like Zhou Xiang. ”

Unfortunately.

Xie Ying left too early.

The heavens were jealous of talented people.

“These words ignited the anger in Zhou Zuolong’s heart. He raised his hand and wanted to hit Zhou Xiang again, “Wanqiu, don’t Stop Me. Let Me Kill this evil daughter. I’ll kill her to pay for Ying ‘ER’s life! Just treat it as if I never raised this idiot!” ”

Xie wanqiu risked her life to block in front of Zhou Xiang.

“Zhou Zuolong pointed at Xie wanqiu and said, “Look at how your mother treated you. Look at how you treated your mother. Are you worthy of being a Daughter?” ”

“As expected, only good seedlings could raise good crops. With a mother like Wu Lan, what kind of daughter could she raise? ”

“Fortunately, Xie Wanqiu was teaching Zhou Xiang and Zhou Jinbei in the later stages. ”

“Otherwise, these two siblings would have been useless by now! ”

“However, Zhou Xiang was fine. Not only did she not thank Xie wanqiu, but she also repaid her kindness with enmity. She was an ingrate. ”

“Xie wanqiu continued, “Old Man, don’t blame Xiang Xiang. It’s all my fault as a mother...” ”

“”What’s wrong with you? Without You, would there still be this vile daughter?”Zhou zuolong continued, “Instead, it’s her who has repeatedly angered you into the hospital! Now, she still treats her kindness like a donkey’s liver and lungs!” ”

Who Was Zheng Wanyin? Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

She was the only person in the world that Xie Wanqiu was related to by blood.

“However, Xie Wanqiu was willing to let Zheng Wanyin marry into the Cen family, allowing Zheng Wanyin to relieve the CEN family of its suffering. ”

How many grandmothers were willing to let their own granddaughters sink into the Mire?

But Xie Wanqiu did it.

But what about Zhou Xiang?

“Not only did she not appreciate her kindness, she even felt that Xie Wanqiu had taken a liking to something in the Cen family. ”

What did the Cen family have?

Didn’t they just have a few lousy dollars?

“An outstanding girl like Zheng Wanyin, what kind of family couldn’t she marry? ”

Was there a need to keep an eye on the Cen Family?

“Anyone could understand this logic, but Zhou Xiang did not. ”

“Xie wanqiu looked at Zhou Xiang and continued, “Xiang Xiang, quickly apologize to your father. Lower Your Head and let your Father Forgive You!” ”

Lower her head?

“If she lowered her head, wouldn’t that mean that she agreed with Zhou Zuolong’s Words? ”

“Zhou Xiang knelt on the ground and cried, “Father, I’m begging you. Can you not do this? Shaoqing and Zhuoluo are truly in love. Zhuoluo is a very good, very outstanding girl!” ”

“Zhou Zuolong was already in a fit of anger, so when he heard these words, he became even angrier. “What did you say? Say It Again?” ”

“Things had already come to this point, yet Zhou Xiang was still able to say these words. ”

“She couldn’t really think that ye Zhuo was some Miracle Doctor Ye and the Chief of Shunxi Financial Group, right? ”

Did she not have brains?

“Zhou xiang continued, “I beg you to help these two children! Wanyin and Shaoqing are not compatible at all. I beg you not to randomly pick a couple.” ”

She and Cen Shaoqing were not compatible?

“When she heard this, a cold light flashed across Zheng Wan Yin’s eyes. ”

What did Zhou Xiang Mean?

Could it be that she was not even comparable to ye Zhuo.
