“However, although second elder nodded, he did not really want to apologize.”

“In any case, it was just a verbal agreement.”

“If he did not apologize, what could ye Zhuo Do?”

“Perhaps after a long time, Ye Zhuo would forget about this matter.”

“Guan Sheng continued, “And that Liu Caiyi, how do you plan to deal with Liu Caiyi?””

Second Elder raised his head in surprise. “What do you mean?”

“Guan Sheng said, “Liu Caiyi has repeatedly questioned Miss Ye’s plagiarism and has no intention of repentance. She has caused the Chinese art world to lose face. Such a person is definitely not suitable to stay in the Chinese art world. Her position will be temporarily replaced by Pingjiang.””

This could be considered as an explanation to ye Zhuo.

“After all, this matter was indeed unethical by the Chinese art world. If they did not show some sincerity, not only would they not be able to answer to Ye Zhuo, they would also not be able to answer to the literary world.”

One had to know that those people in the literary world were all extremely protective of their own shortcomings.

“Hearing this, second elder frowned slightly.”

“Among the younger generation, the person he admired the most was Liu Caiyi.”

“Now that Guan Sheng was going to punish Liu Caiyi, second elder was naturally unhappy. “This matter is my problem alone. How can it implicate vice-president Liu! vice-president Liu is a talented person!””

“Guan Sheng could barely control his emotions. “Shut up! If it weren’t for Liu Caiyi, the matter wouldn’t have ended up like this!””

“As he said that, Guan Sheng turned to look at elder Qi. “I’ll leave this matter to you.””

Elder Qi nodded. “Alright.”

“The second elder was very unwilling and continued, “The matter isn’t that serious, right? vice-president Liu is a talent in our Chinese art world. Aren’t you trying to boost the morale of others and diminish your own prestige?””

“In second Elder’s opinion, their Chinese art world could nurture talents of their own. There was no need for them to suck up to the literary world and Ye Zhuo.”

“Guan Sheng could hear the hidden meaning in second elder’s words. He sighed and said, “The literary world is no longer the literary world of the past. Just do as I say.””

“Second Elder wanted to say something more, but elder Qi stood up and said, “Let’s go. Let’s go out!””

Second Elder was dragged away by Elder Qi.

“Just as second elder left, an assistant came to inform Guan Sheng, “First Elder, chief Li and Master Yu from the literary world are here.””

“Second Elder had just accused Ye Zhuo of plagiarism, and chief Li and Master Yu from the literary world had arrived. It was obvious what they were here for.”

They were definitely here to protect their own!

“Guan Sheng hurriedly said, “Invite them to the VIP Lounge! I’ll be right there!””

“Okay.”The assistant nodded.

“Guan Sheng continued, “Make a pot of good tea and send it over.””

“After saying that, Guan Sheng added, “Go to the warehouse and get some of the purple cloud peak that I collected last year.””

Purple Cloud Peak was the best of the best tea.

“A single gram was sold for five figures. Of course, the most important thing was that there was no market for it. Guan Sheng had gone through a lot of connections and only bought 250 grams. Usually, Guan Sheng would not let anyone touch it.”

“Occasionally, he would want to taste it, but he was afraid of brewing it by counting the tea leaves.”

“But now, Guan Sheng could not care less about the pain. The most important thing was to appease master Yu and Guan Sheng.”

...

Ye Zhuo and Old Mrs. Cen did not go back immediately. There was a particularly popular food street nearby. The young and old went to the food street.

“”Yezi, do you like Durian?”Old Mrs. Cen asked.”

“”I quite like it,”ye Zhuo answered.”

Old Mrs. Cen was pleasantly surprised. “Really?”

Ye Zhuo nodded.

“”I also like eating durian, but they don’t like it! I’ve finally found a bosom friend this time!”Old Mrs. Cen said excitedly, “I know a stall selling roasted durian over there! Let’s go and try it.””

“Roasted durian?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly.

Can roasted durian really be eaten?

“Before ye Zao could react, he was pulled by Old Mrs. Cen to the stall selling roasted durian.”

“Although roasted durian sounded like a dark dish, there were many people who bought it. They all lined up.”

“Ye Zao said, “Grandma Cen, I’ll line up. Please go and take a seat.””

“”Okay.”Old Mrs. Cen nodded and continued, “I’ll go and buy stinky tofu. Do you want to eat stinky tofu?”” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“I can have one.”

“Then I’ll go.”Old Mrs. Cen went to buy stinky tofu.

Ye Zao continued to line up.

“Soon, it was ye Zao’s turn.”

“”Boss, I want two servings of roasted durian.””

“Okay.”

“Ye Zao continued to ask, “How much is it?””

“Two servings of 50 yuan.”

Ye Zao took out a 50 yuan note and handed it to the boss.

“The boss seemed to have not expected ye Zao to give him cash. He looked up at Ye Zao. After all, most young people nowadays paid with their mobile phones.”

“At this glance, the boss’s eyes were filled with surprise.”

“When she heard ye Zao’s voice just now, she had already felt that she was a beauty.”

She did not expect that she would be even more beautiful in person than she had imagined!

“The boss was slightly stunned. He handed the roasted durian to ye Zao. “Beauty, be careful not to burn it.””

“Thank you.”

Ye Zao took the roasted durian and sat down at the table.

Old Madam Cen had not returned from buying stinky tofu.

Ye Zhuo picked up her phone to reply to the message.

“When she opened her phone, she found that it was a message from director Feng.”

Director Feng told her that the first episode of “Village”had been scheduled for release.

Ye Zhuo was a little surprised.

“She had said that the news would only be released after a week, but she didn’t expect it to be approved so quickly.”

“[ ye, after this episode is released, you will definitely become popular. Do you want to consider registering for a Weibo account? ]”

“Actually, Ye Zhuo had a weibo, but he didn’t have a certificate. After all, she just wanted to be a bystander in peace.”

Ye Zhuo replied: [ I don’t want to sign up for a Weibo yet. ]

Director Feng was stunned when he saw ye Zhuo’s message.

He thought that ye Zhuo would definitely agree to sign up for a Weibo.

“After all, this was a rare opportunity.”

He didn’t expect ye Zhuo to directly reject it.

Did this person not want to be popular at all?

“Director Feng then sent a paragraph of text, [ Ye, I have a major female lead role to shoot. The female lead role has not been decided yet. I would like to invite you to audition for the female lead role. ]”

The female lead role for this major female lead role was originally song Chenyu.

“However, after meeting ye Zao, director Feng discovered that song Chenyu and the female lead’s temperaments were not just a little inferior.”

Ye Zao was simply a female lead that had walked out of the script!

“Although he said that he was inviting ye Zao to audition, it was actually just a formality.”

“As long as ye Zao nodded, the female lead’s role would be ye Zao’s.”

“[ thank you for your kindness, but my acting skills are not good. I might have to disappoint you. ]”

He rejected it.

Ye Zao still rejected it.

Director Feng scratched his head. He suddenly did not understand why ye Zao would agree to participate in “The village.”.

“Wasn’t the purpose of going on variety shows to become famous? Then, he could film a television series and become a big star?”

Why did ye Zao not have any intention of doing so?

“For a moment, director Feng suddenly had some doubts about ye Zao’s character.”

“However, it did not matter if ye Zao did not agree. He could look for Li Shang.”

“Li Shang was the boss of world of motion. Ye Zao was the contract anchor of world of motion. As long as Li Shang agreed, ye Zao would definitely agree.”

“Thinking of this, director Feng gave Li Shang a call. After explaining the purpose of his visit, Li Shang said directly, “Director Feng, I can’t make the decision on this matter either. You should talk to miss ye directly! As long as she has no problems, I have no problems here.””

Director Feng was stunned again.

“Li Shang was clearly the CEO of world of Xing, so why did he now have the illusion that ye Zhuo was the boss of world of Xing?”

Director Feng hung up the phone gloomily.

“At the Food Street, Ye Zhuo waited for a while. Then, old Mrs. Cen came over with something.”

“Not only did she buy stinky tofu, but she also bought other snacks and two desserts that ye Zhuo liked.”

“”Grandma Cen, thank you.””

“Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “Silly child, who’s with whom? By the way, is this roasted durian good?””

“I haven’t eaten it yet.”Ye Zhuo picked up a spoon and scooped a spoonful. “It’s not bad. It’s not as strange as I thought. Please try it.”

Old Mrs. Cen also took a bite. “I feel that it’s much better than the unroasted durian!”

“Ye Zhuo finished the roasted durian and started eating the stinky tofu. “By the way, Grandma Cen, the variety show I’m participating in has already been booked.””

“Really?”Old Mrs. Cen’s eyes lit up. “When will it start?”

“Ye Zhuo said, “Friday night at 8 pm.””

“Old Mrs. Cen subconsciously bent her fingers. “It’s already Tuesday today, which means that we’ll be able to watch it in three days.””

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Can we watch the trailer now?””

“”We should be able to watch it now,”ye Zao said.”

“Upon hearing this, Old Mrs. Cen immediately took out her phone, opened the app, and looked for the trailer.”

“There was a total of three minutes of the trailer. It only said that there was an unexpected new guest joining this season. In order to maintain the mysteriousness and viewership ratings, Ye Zao was not allowed to show his face throughout the entire process.”

“Old Mrs. Cen threw her phone to the side and said speechlessly, “I felt lonely watching it! This program team really knows how to keep me in Suspense!””
