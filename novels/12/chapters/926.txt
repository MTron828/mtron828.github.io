“Cen Yuyan turned around and left. “Wait, I’ll find someone to appraise it now!””

She didn’t believe that Zhou Rui and his parents would lie to her!

“Yuyan!”Zhou Xiang called out to Cen Yuyan.

Old Madam Cen patted Zhou Xiang’s hand. “Let Her Go!”

“Cen Yuyan came to a jade appraisal center. After the boss looked at the bracelet, he smiled and said, “Miss, this kind of table is the cheapest glass bracelet. It’s sold in the wholesale market by the catty. It’s not worth anything at all.””

Cen Yuyan’s expression was a little ugly. “I didn’t ask you about this. I just want to know if this bracelet was left behind 21 years ago!”

“The boss smiled and said, “Miss, what kind of joke are you making? ! There was no such technology 21 years ago! This is the kind that was mass produced on a machine.””

Cen Yuyan frowned. “Are you sure you didn’t see wrongly?”

“The boss continued, “I saw through this technology at a glance! How could I have seen wrongly? !””

“Cen Yuyan did not believe that Zhou Rui would lie to her. She went to several jade shops, but the results were the same.”

This was a jade bracelet that could not be any newer.

Cen Yuyan had never thought that Zhou Rui would lie to her.

Could it be that Zhou Rui was really with her because of her money?

“She loved Zhou Rui so much, but Zhou Rui lied to her!”

PA —

Cen Yuyan directly threw the cheap jade bracelet on the ground.

“Looking at the broken jade bracelet, Cen Yuyan felt extremely uncomfortable and wanted to find a place to cry.”

Cen Yuyan came to Song Chenyu’s residence.

“Because of his injury, song Chenyu had not returned to work and had been recuperating at home for the past few days.”

“When he saw Cen Yuyan come over, song Chenyu said in surprise, “Yuyan, didn’t you bring Zhou Rui home to meet his parents today? Why are you free to come to my place? Could it be that your family is dissatisfied with Zhou Rui?””

“Cen Yuyan was already extremely uncomfortable. When she saw song Chenyu, she immediately cried out, “Chenyu! They lied to me!””

“”Who lied to You?”Song Chenyu narrowed his eyes. “Yuyan, don’t cry first. Let’s talk slowly.””

“Cen Yuyan said, “Zhou Rui lied to me! Their entire family is lying to me!””

“Hearing this, Song Chenyu’s heart thumped.”

What was going on?

Could it be that Cen Yuyan had discovered something?

It shouldn’t be!

Zhou Rui had disguised himself so well. How would a fool like song Chenyu be able to see through it?

“Song Chenyu continued, “What exactly is the reason? Tell me slowly.””

Cen Yuyan sobbed as she told him what had happened.

Song Chenyu frowned without leaving a trace.

Idiot! RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The whole family was an idiot!

They were simply extremely stupid.

She never thought that mother Zhou would think she was smart enough to use a fake bracelet to fool Cen Yuyan.

“Even if Cen Yuyan was an idiot and she couldn’t tell anything, the Cen family were all shrewd people!”

Weren’t they just looking for trouble for themselves?

They were things that couldn’t do anything but ruin everything!

“Song Chenyu patted Cen Yuyan’s back, then, she said, “Yuyan, you’re too impulsive. Actually, you should have confronted Zhou Rui about this matter! “Although I’m not very familiar with Zhou Rui, there’s a phrase that goes like this: ‘looks come from the heart.’from Zhou Rui’s appearance, he’s not the kind of person who lies! “Moreover, from his eyes, I can see that he has you in his heart, and you’re all he has! “I feel that there’s definitely a misunderstanding in this matter!””

“”But the bracelet is indeed fake!”Cen Yuyan continued, “I feel that their family just thinks that I’m gullible, that I’m a Retard!””

“Cen Yuyan cared about Zhou Rui, but at this moment, she was very disappointed in the Zhou family!”

She really treated mother Zhou as her future mother-in-law.

But what about Mother Zhou?

She lied to Cen Yuyan like she was a fool!

“Song Chenyu took a tissue to wipe Cen Yuyan’s tears. “Yuyan, don’t say that. I really don’t think Zhou Rui is that kind of person!””

“After saying that, song Chenyu threw the tissue into the trash can. “I’m going to the bathroom. You need to calm down and think about everything that happened between you and Zhou Rui.””

Cen Yuyan nodded.

“Song Chenyu went to the washroom and made a call. Soon, the call was answered.”

“What’s wrong with you?”Song Chenyu’s voice was filled with anger.

“What’s Wrong?”Zhou Rui was very noisy. One could tell that they were at that kind of entertainment venue.

“Song Chenyu continued, “What’s with that bracelet? Who asked you to think that you’re smart enough to give her a broken bracelet?”Because the washroom’s soundproofing was very good, song Chenyu did not deliberately lower his voice.”
