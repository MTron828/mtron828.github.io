“Could it be that their son is not a Chen Shimei?”

“I heard from Old Yu’s wife that they were preparing for their wedding!”

“”As expected, when a man is rich, he will turn bad! Old Yu’s son just became famous, but he dumped his girlfriend! I think this girl has been with Yu Zifei for a long time, right?” ” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“”Yeah, it’s been two to three years!” ”

“”Not to mention other things, but the old Yu family’s actions are too unethical.” ”

“...”

“Everyone was discussing animatedly, and Zhang Pandi’s lips curled up. ”

“Now, Yu Zifei’s identity was no longer the same as before. If this matter continued to ferment, it would definitely attract the attention of the media. At that time, she would be the victim. Under the pressure of public opinion, Yu Zifei would have to accept her. ”

“Tian Zhifang stood in front of the window by the kitchen and saw this scene. She was so angry that she gritted her teeth. Although she was far away and could not hear what the crowd was saying, she could tell from their looks that they definitely did not say anything good. ”

“She could not let Zhang Pandi distort the truth downstairs. She had to protect Yu Zifei’s reputation, especially since Yu Zifei had just appeared on television. ”

“Tian Zhifang immediately put down the dishes in her hands and walked downstairs. When she passed by the living room, she happened to see a speaker. She picked up the speaker and went downstairs to explain to the crowd. ”

“”Dear neighbors, I, Tian Zhifang, have lived here for 30 years. Everyone should know my character very well!”Tian Zhifang held the speaker in her hand, then, she said, “This woman, her name is Zhang Pandi. She is the female pelvis that my son has been talking to for three years. My Son has poured out his heart and soul to her. The two of them even have a good view of the marriage room! “But what about her? “How did she treat my son? She felt that my son was useless following behind Miss Ye. She asked my son to withdraw from Miss Ye’s aircraft carrier project team and betray Miss Ye. My Son was unwilling to betray Miss Ye, so she threatened my son with a breakup! “Everyone present understood Zi Fei. Is Zi Fei someone who can betray a leader so easily? Zi Fei was determined not to betray Miss Ye, so this woman hooked up with a big leader in the blink of an eye! Who would have thought that the heavens would be enlightened and allow Miss Ye’s false aircraft carrier to succeed? Zi Fei also benefited greatly from it. Seeing that Zi Fei was now famous, this woman wanted to return to Zi Fei’s side! “Neighbors, come and judge. Do you think this kind of woman can be wanted?” ”

Tian Zhifang said a lot in one breath.

“Hearing this, the neighbors’attitudes immediately changed. ”

“I really didn’t expect this little girl to be this kind of person!”

“”Good division! If Zifei really marries this kind of person, then your old Yu family won’t have peace in the future!” ”

“”I told you, Zifei that child is not Chen Shimei!” ”

“I really didn’t expect that there would be such a shameless person in the world!”

“Zhang Panti lowered her head, her face alternated between green and white. It was very uncomfortable. ”

She never dreamed that today would happen.

“Even though Zhang Panti’s heart was strong, she could not accept such an accusation. She stood up from the ground, pushed aside the crowd and ran into the car. She lay on the driver’s seat and cried loudly. ”

She cried very sadly.

“In order to redeem Yu Zifei, she did not even care about her dignity and face, but what she got in return was criticism and abuse from everyone. ”

This was not the result she wanted!

“After crying for a long time, Zhang Pandi’s mood became a little more stable. Then she picked up her phone and took out a phone. ”

“Hello.”Yu Zifei’s voice came from the other side.

“Zhang Pandi said in a stifled voice, “Zifei, I want to see you, just once.” ”

“”There is no need for us to meet again.”Yu Zifei’s voice was very calm, “Zhang Pandi, we have no relationship now. Let’s leave some dignity for each other.” ”

“With that, Yu Zifei was about to hang up the phone. ”

“Zhang Panti seemed to know what he was doing. She cried and said, “Zifei, I’m right below your house! Can You Come Down and meet me? Please!” ”

Yu Zifei came to the window and saw Zhang Panti’s car.

“Wait for me.”

“Hearing that Yu Zifei was willing to meet her, Zhang Panti’s heart was filled with endless hope. ”

“After hanging up, Yu Zifei put on his coat and walked out the door. ”

“Seeing him like this, Yu Yuan asked curiously, “Brother Yu, where are you going?” ”

Yu Zifei turned around. “Zhang Pandi is waiting for me downstairs.”

Yu Yuan frowned slightly. “You’re going to meet her?”

Yu Zifei nodded.

“”Then I’ll go with you,”Yu Yuan stood up and said. ”

“Okay.”Yu Zifei nodded.

The two went downstairs together.
