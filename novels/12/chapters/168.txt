Chapter 169: 087: tearing a mistress apart, divorce! 5

Xia Xiaoman glanced at an dongliang. “If I don’t explain this clearly, I’m afraid I’ll be so disgusted that I won’t be able to eat it.”

Hearing this.

An Dongliang’s eyebrows twitched.

Could it be that Xia Xiaoman already knew about it?

It shouldn’t be possible, right?

Everyone said that their daughter was their father’s lover. An Lizi shouldn’t have betrayed him.

An dongliang smiled and said, “What’s the matter? Why are you making it sound so serious?”

Xia Xiaoman walked over and sat on the sofa. She looked at an dongliang and said calmly, “An dongliang, do you still want to live this life?”

An Dongliang’s heart skipped a beat.

An Lizi had really betrayed him!

“Xiaoman, what are you talking about! I don’t understand!”An dongliang tried to muddle through.

Xia Xiaoman took out the few photos from the sofa cushion and threw them on the table. “How do you explain this?”

An Dongliang’s face turned pale and decided not to explain. “Since you’ve already discovered it, I have nothing to say! Xiaoman, I’ve let you down, but you also know that love is something that can not be controlled!”

......

“I only have one question for you. Who Do You Choose, me, Lizi, this family and this B * Tch?”

From her mother’s point of view, Xia Xiaoman still wanted to take back this family.

Even if an Dongliang had already betrayed her.

As long as an Dongliang was willing to repent, she was still willing to give him a chance.

An Lizi was already so old. She could not let her child not have a father!

Moreover, an Lizi was already in her third year of high school this year. The third year of high school was the most important year in her life. She did not want an Lizi to lose her father and a very happy family in such an important year.

“I choose you!”An Dongliang said without hesitation.

“Okay!”Xia Xiaoman said, “Then, I’ll give you a Chance!”

An dongliang reached out and hugged Xia Xiaoman. “Xiaoman, thank you! You’re a good woman. I swear that I won’t let you down again!”

Xia Xiaoman sighed. “A prodigal son can never be changed. I hope that you really repent!”

“It’s true, I swear!”

When an Lizi came out for dinner, she was stunned to see that her parents were still the same as before. Disbelief was written all over her face.

She did not understand why her mother would forgive her father.

After dinner, while he was out for a walk, an Dongliang went to Liang Xinyi’s place.

Seeing him come over, liang xinyi asked curiously, “Didn’t you go back to accompany your wife and child? Why Are You Back Again?”

An Dongliang pinched his temples. “Don’t mention it! She found out about us. I may not be able to visit you in the next few days.”

Liang Xinyi rolled her eyes. “Was it your daughter who snitched?”

An Dongliang was stunned. “How did you know?”

Liang xinyi continued, “When I saw your daughter at the cinema yesterday, I knew that your daughter was not someone to be trifled with! She doesn’t have a father like you in her heart either!”

After saying this, Liang Xinyi hugged an dongliang. “Dongliang, you’re not going to break up with me, are you? I love you, I can’t Live Without You!”

An Dongliang kissed her. “Of course not! Don’t worry, I Won’t break up with you. It’s just that we can’t see each other for the time being.”

“What about your wife?”Liang Xinyi asked tentatively. “Aren’t you afraid that your wife Will Divorce You?”

An dongliang said, “Don’t worry! She Won’t divorce me!”

Liang Xinyi hugged an Dongliang. “Dongliang, I’ve been following you for five years without a name or status. Don’t you want to give me an explanation?”

It had been five years.

Liang Xinyi felt that she should get an answer as well.

The current liquidity of the An family was more than three million yuan. With the addition of the supermarket, it was at least 20 million yuan! 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

If an Dongliang and Xia Xiaoman divorced, they would get 10 million yuan!

With this 10 million yuan, she would be a rich lady in the future!

If it was not for an Dongliang’s money, she, a university student, would not have taken a fancy to a married man.

An Dongliang looked at Liang Xinyi. “I, I thought you didn’t care about this...”

Liang Xinyi had never mentioned this question in all these years.

Liang Xinyi narrowed her eyes, “Dongliang, there’s no woman who doesn’t care about status. However, if you’re in a difficult position, then forget it. I’m willing to wait for you. Even if you don’t give me status in your life, I don’t care.”

An Dongliang suddenly felt that Liang Xinyi was a thousand times more kind-hearted than Xia Xiaoman.

Xia Xiaoman was a jealous woman!

Didn’t he just raise a woman outside?
