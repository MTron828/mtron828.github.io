“What should I do?”Xie wanqiu did not seem to understand Zheng Wanyin’s words.

“Zheng wanyin continued, “Just, just get cousin-in-law to come over and apologize to you.” ”

“Hearing that, Xie Wanqiu’s expression turned cold. “Inappropriate? What’s inappropriate? Ye Zhuo should apologize to me!”If it was not for ye Zhuo, she would not have been so angry that she would have been hospitalized, and Zheng Wanyin would not have been expelled from ABA. ”

All of this was ye Zhuo’s fault.

“Zheng wanyin said, “But this matter really can’t be blamed on cousin-in-law. It’s all my own fault. My skills are inferior to others!” ”

“Zheng Wanyin was so outstanding, how could it be that her skills were inferior to others? ! ”

“”Who said it’s your fault? It’s clearly that little b * Tch Ye Zhuo’s fault!”Ye Zhuo was the main examiner. She could have given Zheng Wanyin a triple A, but not only did she not give her a triple A, she gave her an A instead! ”

Wasn’t this deliberately targeting Zheng Wanyin?

“Not only was it deliberately targeting her, it was also deliberately insulting her. ”

“Moreover, she had specifically instructed ye Zhuo to make sure that Zheng Wanyin got a Triple A. ”

“However, Ye Zhuo had taken her words as though they were nothing! ”

Ye Zhuo clearly did not take her as a grandmother seriously.

“If she did not let ye Zhuo apologize to her, Ye Zhuo would really think that she, a grandmother, was easy to bully! ”

This was simply outrageous!

“Zheng wanyin sighed, “If cousin-in-law doesn’t come, do you really plan to stay in the hospital forever?” ”

“”Not coming! ?”Xie wanqiu widened her eyes and said angrily, “If she dares not come, she can forget about marrying my grandson! I want to see how much courage she has to dare to disregard the words of a grandmother like me!” ”

“Xie Wanqiu was certain that ye Zhuo would definitely come, so she dared to say those harsh words! ”

“As long as ye Zhuo wanted to marry into the Cen family, he had to come and apologize to her. ”

“Otherwise, Xie wanqiu would not be able to hold back her anger. ”

“Zheng wanyin continued, “Grandmother, the family is peaceful and everything is prosperous. Otherwise, let’s just forget about this matter!” ”

“”You child are too kind! That’s why ye Zhuo dares to bully you like this!”Xie wanqiu narrowed her eyes. “This time, I will definitely kill that little slut’s prestige!” ”

“If a tiger didn’t show its might, did he think she was a sick cat? ! ”

“As the head of a family, she had to act like the head of a family. ”

Zheng Wanyin’s face was full of sorrow. “But I don’t think cousin-in-law would compromise so easily.” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“If ye Zao didn’t come and apologize to Xie wanqiu, how would Xie Wanqiu End Things? ”

“She couldn’t go back by herself, right? ”

Then Xie Wanqiu would lose face.

“Xie wanqiu could also hear the hidden meaning in Zheng Wanyin’s words. She chuckled and said, “Silly girl, don’t worry! That Little B * Tch Ye Zhuo will definitely come and apologize to me!”Even if ye Zhuo did not come and apologize to her, would cen Shaoqing let her go? ”

How was that possible!

Cen Shaoqing was her grandson. How could he help an outsider.

And Zhou Xiang.

She knew Zhou Xiang’s character too well.

She was as soft as mud.

Zhou Xiang dared to disobey her mother?

Cen Shaoqing and Zhou Xiang were on her side. How could ye Zhuo not come over and apologize to her?

Could it be that ye Zhuo wanted to break up with Cen Shaoqing?

“If they really broke up, that would be even better! ”

Xie wanqiu was worried that she could not break them up.

So.

There were only two results facing Ye Zhuo.

“First, she had to come over obediently and apologize to her. ”

“Second, she didn’t have to come over to apologize. ”

“If ye Zao came over to apologize, Xie Wanqiu could use this opportunity to kill ye Zao’s prestige. ”

“If ye Zao didn’t come over to apologize, she would get Cen Shaoqing to dump ye Zao. ”

These two outcomes were extremely beneficial to Xie wanqiu.

It could be said that she killed two birds with one stone.

“Thinking of this, the corners of Xie Wanqiu’s mouth curled up. ”

“Zheng Wanyin was still a little worried. “Grandma, it’s better to be safe than sorry...” ”

“Xie wanqiu smiled and patted Zheng Wanyin’s hand. “Wanyin! To be honest with you, I was actually hoping that ye Zao wouldn’t come and apologize to me.” ”

Zheng Wanyin was stunned for a moment.

“Xie wanqiu continued, “Zhou Xiang is my daughter, and Shaoqing is my grandson. Do you think that the two of them will try to influence others? As long as ye Zao dares to disregard me as his grandmother, I’ll immediately get Shaoqing to dump ye Zao.”No matter what.., she was still Cen Shaoqing’s grandmother. ”

A grandmother and a grandmother were the same role.

Cen Shaoqing respected the old lady cen as a grandmother.

How could he not respect her as a grandmother?

Cen Shaoqing respected the old lady cen so he accepted ye Zao and started a relationship with ye Zao.

Similarly.

Cen Shaoqing could also choose to dump ye Zao because he respected her.

Unless Cen Shaoqing did not even want her as a grandmother anymore.

Zheng Wanyin narrowed her eyes and understood Xie Wanqiu’s words.
