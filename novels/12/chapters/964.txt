“The top five trending articles on Weibo were all about song Chenyu, and the words before the articles were all ‘exploded’.”

“When he clicked on the trending articles, he could see the Zhou family’s parents standing in front of the camera, complaining about song Chenyu’s unfilial behavior.”

“In front of the camera, the Zhou family’s parents were dressed in shabby clothes, crying until their eyes were swollen. They looked as if song Chenyu had really abused them.”

“”I raised her up with all my might, but now she actually despises us as country bumpkins and refuses me and her father. If I had known this would happen, I wouldn’t have sent her to the city to study that year!””

“”You reporters, please give us a verdict. Is there such an unfilial daughter like her in this world?””

“”The year I gave birth to her, I almost died from dystocia. When I was young, I would always cling to her whenever there was anything good to eat or drink at home! Who knew that I would raise such an ingrate!””

“Father Zhou put his arm around mother Zhou’s shoulder. “Her mother, don’t be sad. It’s not Chenyu’s fault for not recognizing us. who asked us to be from the countryside? If we weren’t from the countryside, Chenyu would definitely recognize us.””

“After saying that, Father Zhou looked at the camera. “Please Don’t blame Chenyu. Actually, it hasn’t been easy for her for so many years. No matter what, we parents can’t drag her down.””

“After saying that, mother Zhou and father Zhou hugged each other and cried.”

The Zhou family’s parents’words and actions made the netizens furious.

“Just because the Zhou family’s parents were not from the city, Song Chenyu could disown him?”

Heartless!

She was simply too heartless!

“Celebrities lived under the spotlight. Their words and actions affected the values of the young generation, especially those underage fans.”

“A national idol could actually abandon her parents, so what right did she have to stand in front of the screen?”

She was simply a social tumor that affected the next generation of the motherland.

“Seeing the Zhou family’s parents acting in front of the camera, song Chenyu’s face turned pale. She opened her Weibo with trembling hands.”

The comments at the bottom of the Weibo were all to scold her.

“The number of comments at the bottom of the latest Weibo Post had already reached more than 100,000. What was even scarier was that the number of comments was still increasing rapidly.”

“[ I really didn’t expect you to be this kind of person! Previously, you pretended to be pitiful and said that you were an orphan on the show, but it turns out that you’re not an orphan at all! ]”

“[ so disgusting. You’ve become a bright and beautiful superstar, and now you don’t even care about your parents. ]”

“[ before, I thought that the matter with Yezi was song Yiwan’s fault. Now, it seems that it’s your fault! ]! Song Yiwan was clearly standing up for you. It was fine if you weren’t grateful to song Yiwan, but in the end, you still had to step on her! How disgusting! ]”

[ a person like you doesn’t deserve to stay in the entertainment industry. ]

[ I support song Chenyu to get out of the entertainment industry! ]

[ get out of the entertainment industry! ]

[ you don’t even care about your own parents. What right do you have to be a human? You’re an animal! Calling you an animal is an insult to animals! ]

[ people like you don’t deserve to live in this world! ]

[ unfilial son! Go To Hell! ]

“[ after watching the video, I was really angry! If it weren’t for your parents, would you be the person you are now? People like you are simply a cancer to society! ]”

“[ I really feel sorry for your parents. They are still speaking up for you even at this time, and they even asked us not to blame you! Ask yourself in your conscience, are you worthy of your parents? ]”

“[ I’ve been your fan for three years. Today, I have to say goodbye. ]”

[ I’m no longer a fan. Goodbye! ]

“[ I suddenly feel sorry for Song Yiwan. At that time, song Yiwan was clearly standing up for song Chenyu, but after the incident, song Chenyu turned around and bit song Yiwan! ]”

“I don’t understand how a person like you can still become a celebrity!”

“Not only were there unsightly comments, there were even people who photoshopped song Chenyu’s photo into a posthumous photo.”

“Song Chenyu’s hands were trembling, and layers of cold sweat appeared on her forehead.”

Never in her dreams did she expect that the Zhou family’s parents would cause such a scene.

“As a celebrity that was the focus of everyone’s attention, she was most afraid of such dirt.”

What should she do?
