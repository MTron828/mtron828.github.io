Translator: 549690339

“”You apologize on her behalf? What right do you have to apologize on her behalf?”Xie wanqiu got up from the bed, pointed at Zhou Xiang’s nose and scolded, “Get lost, get lost right now! I don’t want to see you!” ”

“Mom!”

“Xie wanqiu continued, “I’ll put my words here for you today. As long as ye Zao doesn’t come to apologize to me, I Won’t go back for a day!” ”

“”Why do you have to be like this!”Zhou Xiang continued, “I’m Zao Zao’s future mother-in-law. There’s no difference between me and Zao Zao. Is there any difference between me apologizing to you and Zao Zao apologizing to you? Isn’t that what you want? An Apology?” ”

“Hearing this, Xie Wanqiu became even angrier! ”

Zhou Xiang’s words clearly implied that he had already treated ye Zao as the Cen family’s daughter-in-law.

No Wonder ye Zao dared to be so arrogant.

“Xie wanqiu said angrily, “Future mother-in-law? Ye Zao wants to marry my eldest grandson. Did I agree to it? Zhou Xiang! I realize that you’re really getting bolder and bolder now. You Dare to make decisions on your own! Do you still take me, your mother, seriously? !” ”

Zhou Xiang also felt a little uncomfortable listening to these words.

Ye Zhuo was the Cen family’s granddaughter-in-law.

What did the Cen family’s marriage have to do with Xie Wanqiu?

“Although Zhou Xiang thought so in her heart, she did not dare to say it out loud. ”

“With Xie Wanqiu’s personality, if she said what she thought, Xie wanqiu would probably die of anger! ”

“Zhou Xiang said, “Mom, you’ve Misunderstood Zhuozao. Zhuozao is really a very good and outstanding girl. Not only me, Shaoqing’s grandmother also likes her very much.” ”

Cen Shaoqing’s grandmother?

Bai Tang?

Zhou Xiang was reminding her that her grandmother was not as good as Bai Tang?

Grandmother and grandmother were of the same generation.

“From a certain perspective, grandmother was many times closer than grandmother. ”

Cen Shaoqing’s marriage should have been approved by her grandmother.

Zhou Xiang only dared to treat her this way because she was too easy to talk to.

Xie wanqiu picked up the vase on the bedside table and threw it out. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Bang!

The vase was smashed into pieces.

“Zhou Xiang did not expect Xie wanqiu to suddenly make trouble. She was so scared that her face turned pale, ”

zheng Wanyin’s gaze shifted between Zhou Xiang and Xie wanqiu.

“Xie wanqiu continued, “Get lost! I don’t have a daughter like you!” ”

“Zhou Xiang did not want to leave. She was here to persuade Xie wanqiu to go back today, not to escalate the conflict. “Mom...” ”

“Zheng Wanyin walked over and pulled Zhou Xiang’s arm as they walked out. “Second aunt, Grandma is currently in a fit of anger. Let’s leave quickly.” ”

Zhou Xiang looked at Xie Wanqiu and could only follow Zheng Wanyin out.

Outside the ward.

“Zheng Wanyin took the initiative to speak up. “Second aunt, Grandma is old. Many times, she doesn’t consider things as comprehensively as a young person. I apologize on her behalf. Please don’t take it to heart.” ”

Zhou Xiang nodded. “I know.”

“After saying that, Zhou Xiang continued, “Wanyin, I know that you are a sensible and good child. Your Grandma listens to you the most. So, second aunt wants to ask you for something.” ”

“”If there’s anything, second aunt, you can just say it. You Don’t have to be polite with me,”Zheng Wanyin said. ”

Zhou Xiang held Zheng Wanyin’s hand. “Do you have any way to persuade your grandma to go back to her hometown?”

“Xie wanqiu had been staying in the capital all this while, so she could not calm down. ”

Persuade her to go back to her hometown?

Zheng Wanyin frowned without leaving a trace.

What did Zhou Xiang mean by this?

Did she dislike Xie Wanqiu for staying in the capital for too long?

“She did not dare to speak to Xie wanqiu herself, so she used her as a weapon? ”

This plan was really good.

Did she really think that she was the only smart person in the world?

“Zheng Wanyin raised her head slightly and continued, “Second aunt, even if you didn’t tell me, I knew what to do. To tell you the truth, I’ve been trying to persuade Grandma to go back since last night, but Grandma didn’t listen to me...” ”

“Hearing this, Zhou Xiang sighed. ”

Was she really going to make ye Zhuo apologize?

“Then what should we do?”

“After thinking for a while, Zheng wanyin said, “I have a way to reduce Grandma’s anger. Second aunt, do you want to try?” ”

“What Way?”Zhou Xiang looked at Zheng Wanyin hopefully.

“Zheng wanyin continued, “You know that Grandma likes cousin the most. If cousin comes to visit Grandma, Grandma will definitely be appeased.” ”

Ask Cen Shaoqing to come over?

“Hearing this, Zhou Xiang frowned slightly. ”

Would Cen Shaoqing come over?

“As a mother, Zhou Xiang knew Cen Shaoqing somewhat. ”

Cen Shaoqing did not really like Xie Wanqiu as a grandmother.
