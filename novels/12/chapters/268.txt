Translator: 549690339

“I’m not in the wrong. I’m not going.”Zhao Pingting turned her head.

She really could not stand in front of her mother and apologize. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Zhao Pingting would not listen to reason.

Zhao Yingjun had no choice. He shook his head helplessly and left Zhao Pingting’s room.

“Zhao Pingting’s mother was sitting on the sofa in the living room. When she saw Zhao Yingjun walk out of the room, she could not help but ask, “What did that wretched girl say?” ”

“”Mom, Pingting is still young. Don’t be angry with her.”Zhao Yingjun continued, “No matter what, she’s doing this for our own good. Look, her entire family bought gifts, but she didn’t buy them for herself.” ”

“Zhao Yingjun’s mother’s expression was a little ugly, “Then she should do what she can! She shouldn’t have looked at her own status! Could a single student like her buy those things? “You dare to spend so much money just because you’re living with us now. If we were to go to university in the capital in the future, wouldn’t we have emptied out all our assets?” ”

“Zhao Yingjun sighed and didn’t say anything more. He only said, “Tang Jia can return those things tomorrow. Don’t be angry. Go to bed early! I’m going back to sleep too.” ”

“Back in the room, Tang Jia was making the bed. ”

“You’re back!”

“Yeah.”Zhao Yingjun nodded.

“Tang Jia said while making the bed, “Do you think your sister is possessed today? “I’ve never seen her treat US so well. She’s actually so generous today. She even took out the new year’s money! “I’ve just looked up those things on the Internet. Once they leave the cabinet, it’s not a matter of quality. I don’t support returning or exchanging them. I think there’s an 80% chance that they can’t be returned!” ”

Tang Jia had been married for two years.

This was the first time she saw Zhao Pingting buying things for her family.

She felt that something was wrong with this matter.

But she couldn’t figure out what was wrong.

Could it be that smoke was rising from the grave of Old Zhao’s family?

“They can’t be returned?”Zhao Yingjun looked at Tang Jia in surprise.

“”Yeah,”Tang Jia continued, “If you don’t believe me, you can check it yourself.” ”

“Zhao yingjun frowned and said, “No, this thing must be returned! Otherwise, my mother will definitely suffer for a few days! How about this, Tang Jia, you go to the mall tomorrow to exchange it alone. Don’t Let Your Mother Follow You! If the other party doesn’t return it, we’ll pay for it ourselves!” ”

Pay for it ourselves?

“When she heard this, Tang Jia was immediately unhappy. ”

“”Zhao Yingjun, are you crazy? !”Tang Jia couldn’t help but raise her voice, “28,000 yuan! Why should we pay for it! Anyway, I won’t pay for it!” ”

“In order to buy a house, Tang Jia usually didn’t even want to do her hair. ”

“To ask her to pay 28,000 yuan at once, she might as well just kill her with a knife. ”

“Tang Jia! That’s my sister!”

“Tang Jia said speechlessly, “What’s wrong with your sister! Your sister made a mistake. Why should we pay for her?” ”

“Zhao Yingjun was also a little angry. He felt that Tang Jia did not understand him. No matter what, Zhao Pingting was still his sister. “What do you mean by paying for her? Although we paid for this 28,000 yuan, isn’t the item still here?” ”

“”Stop talking! There’s no discussion about this!”Not to mention 28,000 yuan, even if it was 2,800 yuan, Tang Jia would not be willing to pay. ”

“Zhao Yingjun could only comfort Tang Jia, “Isn’t it just 28,000 yuan? We don’t lack that 28,000 yuan! “Besides, didn’t you always say that you wanted to buy a dress for your mother? “Your mother’s figure is about the same as my mother’s. That qipao will definitely be very suitable for your mother to wear. She must be at least 10 years younger!” ”

“Tang Jia snorted coldly. “Forget it! My mother is just an ordinary commoner. She Won’t be able to wear such an expensive silk qipao! It’s more than 7,000 yuan! My mother will be heartbroken when she finds out!” ”

“”Just treat it as a gift for your mother!”Zhao Yingjun continued, “We’ve been married for seven to eight years. You haven’t bought her any expensive gifts yet!” ”

“”With this 7,000 yuan, I might as well buy my mother Gold!”! “Gold can at least increase its value. What can a piece of tattered clothes do? “Your sister is already 19 years old this year, not nine years old. When she bought those things again, she didn’t think about the consequences! “I can’t do something like cleaning up someone’s mess! “If you don’t want to argue with me, then don’t say anymore! “I won’t agree to it!” ”

“In order to avoid arguing with Tang Jia, Zhao Yingjun could only shut up. ”

Zhao Pingting did not sleep the whole night and woke up very early the next morning.

The first thing she did when she woke up was to apologize to Mother Zhao.

“”Mom, I’m sorry! I shouldn’t have lost my temper with you last night. It was my fault! I shouldn’t have wasted money on those useless things, but I’ve already bought them and can’t return them. If you want to scold me, just scold me.” ”
