“After drinking a mouthful of porridge, Cen Yuyan looked at Zhou Rui. “Zhou Rui, I’ll give you another chance. You really don’t have anything to tell me.” ”

“I really don’t.”

“Cen Yuyan put down the bowl and looked at Zhou Rui. “Zhou Rui, when you woke up this morning, you were hiding in the bathroom and talking on the phone. I heard everything.” ”

Zhou Rui was stunned. “I was clearly very quiet...”

“Cen Yuyan grabbed Zhou Rui’s hand and continued to ask, “Is there a problem with your company?” ”

“”It’s alright.”Zhou Rui already had a whole set of methods to deal with Cen Yuyan. “Yuyan, you don’t have to worry. It’s not a big problem.” ”

“I heard that some shareholders are starting to withdraw their capital. Isn’t it a big problem?”Cen Yuyan asked back.

“Zhou Rui sighed, “Yuyan, this is my matter. I don’t want you to get involved. If you’re with me, I want you to be happy. I don’t want you to know about these worries. The company is mine, and these worries are mine.” ”

“Cen Yuyan knew that Zhou Rui was thinking of her. “But if you don’t let me know about this, how can I Help You?” ”

“Zhou Rui looked at Cen Yuyan. “Yuyan, I know that you have the ability to help me, and I know that you really want to help me. But I don’t want to accept your help.” ”

“Why?”Cen Yuyan asked in disbelief.

“Zhou Rui continued, “Yuyan, you were born better than me, and your family background is better than mine. There is a huge gap between us. I don’t want people to say that I spend women’s money, and I don’t want people to talk about you.” ”

“At this point, Zhou Rui sighed, “Do you believe that many people now suspect that I’m with you because of money? “It’s not a big deal for a grown man like me to be wronged, but you’re my girlfriend. As my boyfriend, I should protect you and protect you. How can I let people talk about you?” ”

Zhou Rui displayed the image of a good man to the fullest.

“Cen Yuyan was also touched by him. At this moment, Cen Yuyan was willing to give up everything for Zhou Rui. ”

“”I’m not afraid of being talked about! “I’m also willing to spend money for you!”Cen Yuyan said emotionally, “You’re now my boyfriend, so we should share the good and the bad together. Now that your company has a problem, I, as your girlfriend, actually watch from the sidelines. How does this look?” ”

“Zhou Rui hugged Cen Yuyan emotionally and said with a raised voice, “Yuyan, thank you! Your words are enough. I’ll think of a solution for the company myself. Don’t worry, I’ll definitely have a solution.” ”

Cen Yuyan took out a card. “There’s five million in here. Take it for emergency. The password is my birthday.”

“”No, I can’t Take Your Card.”Zhou Rui directly rejected. ”

“Cen Yuyan said with a straight face, “Zhou Rui, if you don’t take this card, then we’ll break up!” ”

“Yuyan!”

“Quickly take it.”Cen Yuyan directly stuffed the card into Zhou Rui’s hand.

“Zhou Rui wanted to reject it again, but Cen Yuyan said, “Zhou Rui, think carefully before you speak, unless you want to break up with me.” ”

“No! I don’t want to break up with you!”

“Then keep it well.”

“With no other choice, Zhou Rui could only force Cen Yuyan to give him the card. ”

It was still easier to earn the money of a young miss. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Usually, song Chenyu would hesitate for a long time to ask for a million yuan. ”

Cen Yuyan immediately offered five million yuan!

“After breakfast, Zhou Rui drove Cen Yuyan back. “Yuyan, I have something to do at the company today, so I can’t accompany you. I’ll look for you again tonight.” ”

“”Go,”Cen Yuyan said considerately. “Work is more important.” ”

Zhou Rui sent Cen Yuyan upstairs before leaving.

“After getting into the car, Zhou Rui called Song Chenyu. “I’ve settled Cen Yuyan.” ”

“Think of a way to get her pregnant.”Song Chenyu’s voice came from the other end of the phone.

Pregnant?

“Zhou Rui was stunned. They had taken measures last night, so it was impossible to get pregnant. ”

“Isn’t this too fast?”

“Song Chenyu continued, “Only by getting Cen Yuyan pregnant can you completely establish yourself in the CEN family.”Other than Cen Yuyan, everyone in the Cen family was smart. If Zhou Rui did not get Cen Yuyan pregnant.., zhou Rui would never be able to get the Cen family’s approval. ”

Only a child could completely tie Cen Yuyan up.

“Zhou Rui was not a fool. He quickly understood song Chenyu’s intentions and continued, “Alright, I know what to do.” ”

“”En.”Song Chenyu continued, “If there’s any new progress, remember to tell me at any time. When you’re alone with Cen Yuyan, remember to restrain yourself. Don’t expose your Fox’s tail. Be careful.” ”

Zhou Rui was a dummy in front of Cen Yuyan. Everything was an act.

“If Cen Yuyan were to see through Zhou Rui’s true colors, then everything would be for naught. ”

...

On the other side.

Cao Wei had not given up on searching for information on ye Zao these days.

“He had thought that he would never have the chance to find out ye Zao’s true identity. After all, even a hacker God like Baron was helpless. He did not expect ye Zao to suddenly participate in a variety show. ”

“Looking at the figure on the television, Cao Wei narrowed his eyes slightly. ”

This girl had a face that could turn all living things upside down.

“She seemed to be indifferent to everything, but in fact, in this indifference, there was a ruthlessness that could not be ignored. There was also a hint of bandit aura. ”

“In order to understand ye Zao, Cao Wei patiently sat in front of the television and watched the entire episode. ”

“At the beginning, the few stars in the program had a lot of opinions about ye Zao. Even before she showed her face, they had already begun to isolate her. ”

“However, she used her strength to conquer them. ”

Catching snakes with her bare hands.

Driving a tractor.

Three meals a day for the contractors.

“Everyone was disdainful at the beginning, but now they were filled with admiration. All kinds of emotions could be clearly seen even through the television screen. ”

Even the attitude of the fans on the bullet screen changed a lot.

“Cao Wei’s hand fell on Ye Zhuo’s hand, which was cutting vegetables. ”

“To be precise, it was the position of the Little Red Mole. ”

This Little Red Mole was exactly the same as the Little Red Mole on ye Langhua’s hand.

This time.

Did he find the wrong person?

Was there a relationship between Ye Zhuo and ye Langhua?

Cao Wei immediately got someone to look up ye Zhuo’s information.

Time passed quickly.

“In the blink of an eye, it was time to record the second episode of the program. ”

Ye Zhuo arrived at the program team on time.

“Unlike the first time, Ye Zhuo received the warmest welcome from everyone as soon as he arrived at the small courtyard. ”

“Yin Wei immediately rushed out and hugged ye Zhuo. “Yezi, you’re finally here. I’ve been waiting for you for a long time.” ”

“I was delayed on the way here.”

“Wei Xingzhi handed over a Barbie doll. “Yezi, my daughter really likes you after watching the last episode of the show. This is a gift from her to you.” ”

“”Thank you.”Ye Zao continued, “What’s Your Daughter’s name?” ”

“Her name is fan fan. It’s been smooth sailing.”

Ye Zao turned to look at the camera and held the Barbie doll. “Auntie fan fan likes this Barbie doll very much. Thank you.”

“After saying that, ye Zao turned to look at the director. “Director Feng, don’t cut this part.” ”

“Chang Yu smiled and said, “Ye, teacher Feng’s daughter is eight years old this year. How Old Are You? You’re already calling yourself an Auntie.”Furthermore, it was in front of the camera. Most girls cared about their age very much, ”

“however, ye Zao did not seem to care about this at all. ”

He even called himself an Auntie.

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “I’m already old enough to be an aunt. I Can’t take advantage of a child.” ”

“Chang Yu asked curiously, “Yezi, how old are you this year?” ”

“20.”

“Yin Wei said in surprise, “F * ck, Yezi! You’re actually five years younger than me!” ”

“Chang Yu smiled and said, “That Yezi is two years older than me.” ”

“”Can you be a little more shameless?”Yin Wei smiled and said, “You’re already almost 30 years old, yet you’re still pretending to be young.” ”

“In the afternoon, the director assigned the two teams to explore the deep mountains. ”

The director’s team hid a treasure box at the top of the mountain.

Whichever team found the treasure box first would win.

The two teams set off at the same time.

The road up the mountain was not easy. The eight of them stopped halfway up the mountain and began to rest.

“Due to the climate in the east continent, there were many fruit trees hidden in the deep mountains. There were ripe wild fruits all year round. ”

Ye Zao took advantage of the time when everyone was resting to take a look around.

“Yin Wei was the first to notice that ye Zao had disappeared. She asked curiously, “Where’s Yezi?” ”

Chang Yu shook his head. “I don’t know. She was just here a moment ago.”

“Wei xingzhi said, “Could she have gotten lost? Should we go and look for her?” ”

Yin Wei nodded. “Then let’s go and look for her now.”

The environment on the mountain was complex to begin with.
