“Mother Tang continued, “It’s not a big deal that she jumped into the fire pit! I’m telling you, this time, if your uncle and aunt come to beg you, you’re not allowed to help them! That family of ingrates, none of them are good. If it wasn’t for you, would she, Tang Mi, have been accepted into the Cen clan’s base? “They, on the other hand, haven’t even said a word of gratitude all these years!”! “Especially that Tang Mi, not only did she not have the slightest bit of gratitude, she even said that she was accepted into the CEN base by relying on her own strength. If she was really that amazing, why did she die twice?” ” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Speaking up to this point, Tang continued, “That little slut Tang Mi, is just like her mother! One way in front of others, another way behind others!” ”

“Upon mentioning the matter of admission, Tang Xue was furious. Mother Tang was right, that whole family was ingrates. ”

“At that time, if it wasn’t for her sake, how could the examiner have accepted Tang Mi? ”

“Just based on that idiot, Tang Mi. ”

Not to mention three times.

“Even if she took the test thirty times, she wouldn’t be able to enter the CEN base. ”

“”I know, don’t worry. This time, even if they kneel on the ground and beg me, I won’t help them!” ”

“”That’s right!”Tang nodded, then she said, “There’s no favor in helping them! By the way, Xiaoxue, how’s your negotiation with C Nation Going? Have you signed the contract? Will they hand over the management rights of the CEN base to you?” ”

“”The contract was signed two weeks ago,”Tang Xue said. ”

“Tang was stunned, then she said, “You Child, why didn’t you tell us about such a big matter!” ”

“Tang Xue smiled and said, “Mother, Your Daughter’s Glory is still to come!” ”

Mother Tang nodded.

Her greatest pride in her life was to have an outstanding daughter like Tang Xue.

“They were both girls, and only Tang Xue could inherit the mantle of Old Master Tang. ”

As for Tang Mi?

She could only be Tang Xue’s assistant for the rest of her life.

“When the bet agreement expired, Tang Mi wouldn’t even have the chance to be Tang Xue’s assistant! ”

“At that time, the entire Tang Clan could only rely on Tang Xue to carry forward! ”

“Thinking of that scene, mother Tang was extremely excited. ”

“At that time, she would see how Xiao Qing could still be arrogant in front of her! ”

“Xiao Qing relied on the fact that he was born better than her. In front of her, he couldn’t wait to raise his head to the sky! ”

“After saying that, mother Tang continued, “Oh right, Xiao Xue, your third aunt called me and said that she wants to move your cousin to the CEN Group’s base. What do you think?” ”

“Has Bai Yun already graduated from university?”Tang Xue asked.

“”What University? She has already graduated from graduate school!”Tang continued, “Your third aunt only has one daughter, Yun Yun. If we can help her, we will. I guarantee that Yun Yun will definitely not be like that ingrate Tang Mi!” ”

“Bai Yun was Tang’s biological niece. As an aunt, she naturally hoped that her niece would be good! ”

“”Alright.”Tang Xue continued, “In a week’s time, the CEN family base will have an entrance exam. Please let Bai Yun Register first. I’ll inform the examiner when the time comes.” ”

“Mother Tang nodded. “Alright, then I’ll leave the matter of Yun Yun to you!” ”

“As long as Bai Yun isn’t that kind of ungrateful person!”Tang Xue said.

“Mother Tang smiled and said, “Little Xue, don’t worry. Yun Yun is definitely not that kind of person!” ”

“After saying that, mother Tang continued, “The next-door neighbor will definitely come and beg you soon. You have to be firm in your stance!” ”

“The aircraft carrier project team was not so easy to pull out of. If Tang Mi wanted to leave unscathed, she would still have to come and beg Tang Xue. ”

“Okay.”Tang Xue nodded.

“Mother Tang continued, “But don’t reject so quickly. Pretend to hesitate for a moment, okay?”She liked to see Tang Shengli and Xiao Qing acting submissively in front of her. ”

“If she directly rejected them, then she wouldn’t be able to see what she wanted to see! ”

“Got it.”

“As soon as she finished speaking, there was a knock on the door. ”

“”You’re here so quickly.”Tang hurriedly said, “Little Xue, go upstairs first!” ”

“Okay.”Tang Xue turned around and walked upstairs.

Tang walked over to open the door.

The door opened. The person who came was indeed Xiao Qing.

Xiao Qing was still holding something in his hand.

The corners of Mother Tang’s mouth curled up slightly.

“Usually, she did not see Xiao Qing give anything to their family. Now that she had something to ask of them, she only knew how to take things! ”

“”Her youngest aunt, why is she still here so late?”Mother Tang asked despite knowing the answer. ”

“Xiao Qing smiled and said, “Sister-in-law, I just forgot. This is a little local specialty that Shengli brought back from the south city. Take it and have a taste.” ”

Forgot?

A sarcastic look appeared in Tang’s mother’s eyes.
