“Fan Juan smiled and said, “You!” ”

“”Today is a happy day. Let’s not talk about her,”Li da long continued, “To be honest, what’s your impression of Hang Hang?” ”

“Very good.”Fan Juan nodded.

“She did not say anything against her heart, but it was really good. ”

“Fan Juan continued, “I’ve never seen such a sensible child like hang hang.” ”

“Li Dalong was very proud. “After all, she’s my daughter.” ”

Fan Juan nodded.

“Li dalong continued, “By the way, Hang, you’ve met him. When will you arrange for me to meet Qiang Qiang?” ”

Qiang Qiang was fan Juan’s son.

“Hearing this, fan Juan said, “Qiang Qiang said that he wouldn’t interfere in my matters. He’s currently abroad. He shouldn’t be back for a while.” ”

“Speaking up to this point, fan Juan continued, “Qiang Qiang’s attitude might not be as good as Hang Hang’s. When the time comes, don’t mind him.” ”

“Li dalong smiled and said, “Do I look like the kind of person who has a small tolerance?” ”

“In any case, he was not going to live with fan Juan’s son. ”

“Fan Juan continued, “In any case, it’s good that you know what you’re doing. That Child Qiang Qiang has always been like that since he was young. He doesn’t have much to say to a mother like me.” ”

“Okay.”Li Da Long continued to nod.

“Soon, the meal began. ”

Li hang prepared five dishes and a soup.

It was very sumptuous.

“Fan Juan could not help but praise, “Hang Hang is really skillful. The dishes on this table look very delicious.” ”

“”Thank you for your praise, Auntie fan. Dad, quickly bring Auntie fan to sit down. We’re all on the same side today. Tell Auntie fan not to stand on ceremony.” ”

Li Da Long turned to look at fan Juan. “Did you hear what Hang Hang said? Don’t stand on ceremony!”

“Fan Juan smiled and said, “You’re welcome, you’re welcome.” ”

The meal was very enjoyable

“Fan Juan was a very simple woman. She did not have too much scheming, so she naturally did not notice the perfunctory look on Li Hang’s face. ”

“After the meal, Li Da Long sent fan Juan back. ”

“After returning, Li da long looked at Li Hang. “How is it?” ”

Li Hang was stunned. “How is what?”

“Li da long continued, “How is your Aunt Fan?” ”

“Li hang smiled and said, “I think aunt fan is very good. She is much gentler than I thought. Although she is not as beautiful as my mother, she has something that my mother does not have. Therefore, I think she is a good woman who is very suitable for living. Dad, you must hold onto aunt fan well. You must not let her be snatched away by others.” ”

“Fan Juan was only in her forties. She could still give birth to a second child. At that time, even if she were to leave, Li Da Long would still have hope. ”

“As a daughter, she could only help Li da long to this extent. ”

“Hearing this, Li da long smiled and said, “Hang Hang, you summed it up very well. Don’t worry, I will cherish your aunt fan. I Won’t let her be snatched away by others.” ”

“Okay.”Li hang nodded.

“After handling Li da Long’s matter, Li Hang could finally respond to boss Wang with a peace of mind. ”

“At night, she called Zhou Cui Hua. ”

“Hearing that, Zhou Cui Hua said excitedly, “Hang hang, are you serious?” ”

Li hang nodded. “Yes.”

“”Then I’ll let your uncle Wang answer the call,”Zhou Cui Hua said. “Tell him yourself.” ”

“”Okay,”Li Hang said. ”

“Soon, boss Wang walked over and picked up the phone. “Hang Hang.” ”

Li Hang repeated what he had just said.

“Hearing that, boss Wang said happily, “Good, good, good. Hang Hang, hurry up and choose a time to settle the household registration matter. This kind of matter should be settled sooner rather than later.” ”

“”Yes, I know, Uncle Wang.” ”

“Boss Wang continued, “Hang Hang, uncle Wang has already prepared the room for you. You should move over to uncle’s house as soon as possible.” ”

“Okay.”

“”After you’ve finished talking to your father, tell uncle that uncle will send a driver to pick you up.” ”

“”Thank you, Uncle Wang.” ”

“”We’re all on the same side. There’s no need to be so polite. Besides, this is what an uncle should do.” ” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“After hanging up the phone, Li Hang began to think about how to tell Li Dalong. ”

“At noon the next day, Li Hang finally decided to confess to Li Dalong. ”

“”Dad, I want to tell you something. Do you have time now?”Li hang looked at Li Dalong with a serious and serious expression. ”

“Seeing her like this, Li da long smiled and said, “What do you want to tell me? Why Are You So Serious?” ”

“”Something very important,”Li Hang said. ”

“You have a friend?”Li Da Long asked.

Li hang shook his head. “No.”

“Then what is it?”Li Da Long asked curiously.
