Translator: 549690339

“He ziteng pressed his temples and continued, “Yaoyao, where are you now? Let Me Look for you.” ”

Xu Yao was different from other girls.

This was her first time.

This was the time when she needed someone to comfort her the most.

“”I want to be alone,”Xu Yao said. ”

Want to be alone?

“Hearing her say this, he ziteng became even more nervous and continued, “Yaoyao...” ”

“Xu Yao interrupted him and continued, “Ziteng, this kind of thing is consensual. Although you drank last night, I don’t blame you. You should rest well too. I’m hanging up now.” ”

“Xu Yao’s words were very artistic. Although some things could only be done by mutual consent, he ziteng was still drunk last night. ”

“She was a girl, how could her strength compare to he ziteng, a man? ”

She pushed all the questions to he ziteng.

“However, he ziteng did not find anything wrong. ”

“After saying that, Xu Yao directly hung up the phone. ”

“Looking at the phone being hung up, he ziteng frowned slightly and became even more worried. ”

“Judging from Xu Yao’s attitude, she should be very angry. ”

What should they do now?

Over here.

“As soon as Xu Yao hung up, mother Xu immediately came over. “How was it? It was he ziteng who called, right?” ”

“”Yes.”Xu Yao nodded, ”

“What did he say?”Mother Xu asked.

“Xu Yao said, “He said that he wanted to look for me.” ”

“Then what did you say?”Mother Xu asked.

“I said that I wanted to be alone.”

“Hearing that, mother xu smiled and said, “Yes, yes, yes! That’s what you should say! No matter what, girls have to be reserved.” ”

Men were a little hypocritical.

“Although on the surface they said that they liked girls who were more open, in fact, they preferred girls who were more subdued and pure. ”

“Xu Yao nodded. “Mom, I know.” ”

“Mother Kan looked around and lowered her voice. “It’s your first time with He ziteng, isn’t it?” ”

“Although she knew that Xu Yao wasn’t that kind of person, mother Xu was still a little worried. ”

“If it wasn’t Xu Yao’s first time, then her chances of winning would be much lower. ”

“After all, many men had a virgin plot. ”

“Xu Yao’s face was a little red. She nodded and said, “Okay.” ”

Mother Xu nodded in satisfaction.

Good.

Very good.

“Mother Xu asked again, “Was your ovulation period yesterday?” ”

“”Looking at the date, it should be,”Xu Yao said. ”

“Hearing this, mother Xu looked at Xu Yao’s stomach, and her eyes were filled with a satisfied smile. ”

The future glory of the Xu family would depend entirely on Xu Yao’s stomach!

“Once Xu Yao gave birth to the he family’s eldest grandson, then Xu Yao would truly be the best! ”

Would she still need to look at Xu Chaonan’s face in the future?

Xu Chaonan was nothing!

“Seeing mother Xu like this, Xu Yao said somewhat worriedly, “What if we can’t get pregnant?” ”

How could anyone get pregnant on the first try?

“Mother Xu was not worried about this problem at all. “There will always be a second time after the first time. This man, once he starts having sex, he won’t be able to stop! Especially someone as old as he ziteng.” ”

He ziteng was 28 years old and almost 30 years old!

Could a man who was almost 30 years old control himself if he suddenly ate meat? 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Of course not!

“As long as this kind of thing happened a few more times, there was no need to worry about not getting pregnant? ”

Xu Yao nodded and felt that what her mother said made sense.

“At this moment, he ziteng’s call came in again. ”

“Hearing the phone ring, mother Xu looked at Xu Yao and continued, “It’s he ziteng, right?” ”

“Yes.”Xu Yao nodded.

“”You answer it first,”mother Xu said. “But this time, you have to reassure him.” ”

Men could not always be hung up on.

“If they kept hanging on, it would backfire. ”

“Okay.”Xu Yao nodded and answered the phone.

“Soon, an anxious male voice came from the other end of the phone. “Yaoyao, are you really okay?” ”

“”I’m really okay. I’m just a little tired,”Xu Yao said. ”

Tired?

“Hearing this, he ziteng could not help but smile slightly. ”

It must be because he was too powerful that Xu Yao felt tired.

“”If you’re tired, you should rest more.”He ziteng continued, “Yaoyao, I’m your first man. Don’t worry, I’ll definitely be responsible for you.” ”

“Xu Yao said, “Yes, I believe in You.” ”

“”Then are you free tomorrow?”He ziteng asked tentatively. “If you’re free tomorrow, let’s go to the movies together in the afternoon.” ”

“If Xu Yao agreed to him, it meant that Xu Yao was not angry. ”

“If Xu Yao did not agree, then she would definitely be angry. ”
