Carl?

“Yaler frowned slightly. “Who’s Carl? The person I’m looking for isn’t Carl, I’m Looking for An!” ”

“Yaler had been on the streets for so many years, but he had never met an opponent. ”

This was the first time.

“Moreover, the opponent was a girl. ”

“It was fine if she was a girl, but she was still Chinese. ” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Although it was hard to see An’s face clearly, from her clothes and tone, one could vaguely tell that she was Chinese. ”

“After all, in the next few hundred years, China would be the most backward country. ”

It wasn’t a good feeling to be defeated by a girl from a backward country.

“Therefore, he had to find her. ”

It would be best if he could make An change his nationality and become her right-hand man to help him in the future.

It would be a waste for such a talent to be born in China.

“Thinking of this, alar pinched his fingers, and a look of determination flashed across his eyes. ”

“Hearing this, L smiled and continued, “Minister, I know you are looking for An, but you don’t even know who Carl is, so how could you find An?” ”

“”Who is Carl?”Alar turned to look at L, his eyes full of doubt. ”

“L continued, “Carl and An are partners.” ”

“”Partners?”Alar asked, “An has partners?” ”

“Yes.”L nodded.

Alar narrowed his eyes. “How did you know that Carl and An are partners?”

“L continued, “I just looked at the casino’s surveillance footage. An and Carl came together. Their behavior is intimate, so they must be partners.” ”

He just looked at the casino’s surveillance footage?

“Alar continued, “We looked at the casino’s surveillance footage several times, but we didn’t see An’s partner from the beginning to the end. Are you mistaken?” ”

“L lit a cigarette, and a faint smile appeared in his eyes. “You didn’t see Carl. Someone tampered with the surveillance.” ”

“Hearing that someone tampered with the surveillance, a faint light flashed in Yaler’s eyes. “So, you repaired the surveillance?” ”

“Yes.”L nodded.

“When?”Yaler followed up with a question.

“L said, “When we were adjusting the surveillance speed.” ”

“As he said that, he bent down and restored the computer to the surveillance camera. “Minister, come and take a look over here.” ”

Alar walked over.

The computer screen showed the location of the casino’s entrance.

Carl stood there as if he was waiting for someone.

“A moment later, a figure in white clothes and black pants appeared in his field of vision. ”

“Although there were a lot of people gathered at the casino’s entrance, she had an extraordinary temperament. She stood out like a crane among chickens. It was difficult for people not to notice her. ”

“When Carl saw her, he quickly ran over. ”

“Because the distance was too far, the surveillance camera did not capture the speaker of the two of them. ”

“However, from this surveillance camera, it could be seen that the two of them were very familiar with each other. ”

It was true that Yaler had not seen this surveillance camera before.

“After looking at the surveillance camera, Yaler turned to look at Hibbert. “There’s a mole in the casino.” ”

“Otherwise, this surveillance camera would not have been deleted for no reason. ”

Hibbert was stunned.

“If there really was a mole in the casino, it would be his negligence. ”

It was a mismanagement.

“After all, he had just taken over the management of the casino a few months ago. ”

“”It has nothing to do with the Mole,”L said immediately. “I suspect that An had someone hack this footage.” ”

Someone deliberately hacked the footage?

This reminded Yaler of the bounty on An’s head.

Who Was this An?

Who else did she offend?

Yala narrowed his eyes and did not say a word.

“Hearing that it had nothing to do with the mole, Hibbert heaved a sigh of relief, he continued, “Since you can fix the surveillance cameras that An entered, you must be able to fix the surveillance cameras that An left, right? We’ve searched for a long time, but we still haven’t found the surveillance cameras that An left!” ”

“L continued, “This isn’t a question of whether we can fix it or not, because An has never left the casino.” ”

“He didn’t leave? How is that possible!”Hibbert said in surprise.

“L said, “All the time is connected seamlessly. After An entered the casino, he really hasn’t left the casino, unless space and time are in disorder.” ”

“After he said that, L paused, as if he had thought of something. Then he continued, “Mr. Hibbert, is there a back door to the casino?” ”

“Hibbert thought for a moment and continued, “There is, but the back door has been sealed for ten years!”Not to mention a girl, even if ten strong men came, they would not be able to get out through the back door. ”

“Then how did she leave the Casino?”L narrowed his eyes. “Avoid the cameras?”

“”Impossible!”Hibbert directly denied it. “There are more than 500 surveillance cameras at the entrance of the casino, unless she can transform.” ”
