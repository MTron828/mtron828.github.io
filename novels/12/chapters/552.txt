Her granddaughter should have her surname.

She should be the one to choose her name!

“Zhao shuning smiled and said, “I told you not to worry with my brother around. Mom, Shall We Go Back Now?” ”

“We’ll go back.”Old Lady Lin nodded.

“Sun Peiyuan sent the two of them to the car. “Take care, both of you.” ”

In the car.

“Old Madam Lin looked at Zhao shuning. “Shuning, it’s all thanks to your brother. Ask him what time he’s free. I want to invite him over as a guest.” ”

“Zhao shuning said, “My brother has been busy with his promotion recently, so he might not have time to come over.” ”

“Another promotion?”Old Madam Lin was in disbelief.

Zhao Shuqi was 45 years old this year.

He had been promoted three times in the past three years.

His career prospects were boundless!

It seemed that the Zhao family’s position in the capital was about to change.

“Zhao shuning nodded with a smug look in her eyes. “My brother has been promoted three times in a row, so he’s been very busy recently.” ”

Promoted three times in a row?

“Hearing this, Old Lady Lin was even more surprised. “Then I’ll have to prepare a big red packet to celebrate with your brother.” ”

“Zhao shuning smiled and said, “We’re all family. Mom, you don’t have to be so polite.” ”

“Old Madam Lin hurriedly nodded. “Right, right, right! Shuning, you’re right. We’re all family! We’re all family!” ”

“Soon, the car stopped at the entrance of the Lin family manor. ”

“Auntie Zhang greeted them with a smile. “Old Madam, fourth madam, you’re back! How are things going?” ”

“Old Madam Lin nodded. “It’s done, it’s all done.” ”

“Aunt Zhang’s expression changed. “Then congratulations, Old Madam.” ”

Ye Zhuo had become Zhao Linzhuo?

Would Ye Shu and Lin Jincheng agree?

Just wait!

There would be chaos soon.

Aunt Zhang helped old madam Lin into the hall.

“Zhao shuning said, “Aunt Zhang, go and invite Jin Cheng’s family of four over. It’s such a joyous occasion, of course we have to announce it in front of them.” ”

“Hearing that, Old Madam Lin hurriedly nodded in agreement. “Yes, yes, yes! Aunt Zhang, quickly go and call them over.” ” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Aunt Zhang nodded. “Okay, I’ll go right away.” ”

Aunt Zhang turned around and left.

“While she was calling for people, she did not forget to call Feng Qianhua. ”

“Hearing that, Feng Qianhua said in surprise, “It’s really done?” ”

“Aunt Zhang smiled and said, “That’s right! Old Madam Lin and Zhao shuning just came back from the Public Security Bureau and are busy making me call for help! Qianhua, I have to say that you still have a way!” ”

“If Feng Qianhua had not proposed to change her surname, would old madam Lin have thought of this? ”

Feng Qianhua’s move could be said to be a murder without a trace.

She had directly asked Old Madam Lin and Zhao shuning to do it. She had not even touched the slightest bit of it.

“Feng Qianhua continued, “Please keep an eye on that side for me. Once the matter blows up, you can call me.” ”

“”Okay, don’t worry.” ”

“After Aunt Zhang hung up the phone, she turned around and walked toward the east wing. ”

“Just as she turned around, Ye Zhuo walked out from behind her. ”

Ye Zhuo narrowed his eyes slightly and looked very leisurely.

Aunt Zhang and Feng Qianhua were involved.

This matter seemed to be getting more and more interesting...

Not long after.

“Lin Jincheng, Ye Shu, Lin Ze, and Ye Zao appeared in the hall. ”

“Lin Jincheng walked forward. “Mom, why are you looking for us?” ”

“”I have something to announce.”Old Lady Lin continued, “From today onwards, my granddaughter will be Zhao Linzao.” ”

Zhao Linzao?

“Lin Jincheng frowned. “Mom, what are you talking about? What Zhao Linzao?” ”

“Don’t you understand human language?”Old Lady Lin glared at her disappointing son. “Zhao Linzao is the new name I gave my granddaughter!”

“Hearing this, Ye Shu stood up from her chair. “I said it! I don’t agree to change the name of my granddaughter!” ”

“”You don’t agree? What right do you have to disagree?”Old Lady Lin slammed the table loudly. “Ye Shu, let me tell you! This is our Lin Family! You Don’t get to tell us what to do about our Lin Family!” ”

“Mom!”Lin Jincheng frowned. “What do you want?”

“Old Lady Lin looked at Lin Jincheng. “Jincheng, I’m Your Mom! I’m the old lady of the Lin family. Don’t tell me that I can’t even make this decision now? I can call my granddaughter whatever I Want!” ”

She was the old lady of the Lin family.

She was the absolute authority of the Lin Family!

“After hearing what had happened, Lin Ze stood up angrily from his chair. “Grandma! You’ve gone too far! How can you change searing’s name so easily?” ”

“Madam Lin looked at Lin Ze with disappointment in her eyes, “Ah Ze, I see that I’m becoming less and less of a Grandma in your eyes! Don’t forget, who raised you when you were young? If it weren’t for me, would you have existed?” ”

“”I won’t forget your kindness in raising me,”Lin ze continued, “But don’t forget, if it weren’t for you carrying me away, I would have grown up by my mother’s side.” ”

Old Mrs. Lin’s face turned pale. She didn’t expect that she had really raised a wolf.

“She didn’t expect that her grandson, whom she had worked so hard to raise, would one day talk to her like that! ”

“She had allowed Lin ze to enjoy so many years of a wealthy life, but Lin ze did not appreciate her at all... ”

“If she had not carried Lin ze back, Lin Ze would have suffered so much behind ye Shu. ”

“As expected, Lin Ze still followed that B * Tch Ye Shu. ”

“If she had not been sitting on the chair, old Mrs. Lin might have already fallen to the ground. ”

“Old Lady Lin said angrily, “Don’t say that you’re changing her name! If I’m not happy, I’ll Change Your Name Too! As long as I don’t die, the Lin family’s matters will be decided by me!” ”

“Ye Shu was just about to stand up when she heard ye Zao say indifferently, “Mother.” ”

Ye Shu turned around to look at ye Zao.

“She saw that ye Zao was extremely calm. At this time, she still had the mood to elegantly trim her nails. ”

“After a while, ye Zao blew at his nails and looked up at Old Lady Lin. “I’m sorry, but you really don’t have the final say on this matter.” ”

“Her tone was indifferent, but her voice was firm. ”

“Especially her pair of cold eyes, which made Old Lady Lin subconsciously shiver. ”

Old Lady Lin frowned. She had lived for more than half her life. When had she ever been afraid of a wild girl?

“”I’ve already changed the name.”Old Lady Lin asked the maid to take out the information. “From now on, you’re Zhao Linzhuo!” ”

Ye Zhuo’s eyebrows remained the same. “You want my surname to be Zhao? Are You Worthy?”

“Impudent!”Old Lady Lin glared fiercely at Ye Zhuo. “You have no manners at all! Do you know who you’re talking to?”

At this moment.

An urgent phone call rang in the air.

“Zhao shuning frowned slightly and was about to hang up, but when she saw the call, she picked it up. “Brother.” ”

“”Zhao shuning! Do you know that the entire Zhao family is going to be implicated by you this time!”Zhao Shuqi’s voice sounded very panicked, “Hurry up and go to the Public Security Bureau with your old lady right now. Change Miss Ye’s name the same way you changed it!” ”
