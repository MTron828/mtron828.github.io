Translator: 549690339

“”Young Master Yu, have another bite.”Xian ‘er handed another skewer to Yu sunset. ”

Yu sunset opened his mouth and took it.

“Is it good?”Xian ‘er asked.

“Yu sunset said perfunctorily, “It’s alright.” ”

“Actually, he didn’t even taste the taste of the skewer before he swallowed it. ”

“Having received Yu Sunset’s affirmation twice in a row, Xian ‘er was very excited and continued, “Then I’ll roast another skewer for you.” ”

“Mm.”Yu Shaoqing nodded.

“At this moment, Yu Shaoqing actually saw Cen Shaoqing eating a skewer of grilled squid when he raised his head. His eyes immediately widened. ”

“Ever since he had known Cen Shaoqing, Cen Shaoqing had been a vegetarian. ”

“Back then, he had even persuaded Cen Shaoqing to eat some meat dishes properly. After all, only with meat and vegetables could one have a balanced diet. ”

How could a man eat grass all the time?

How could he endure it?

“However, Cen Shaoqing did not listen. He did not even take an egg, let alone meat dishes. ”

“The strange thing was that although Cen Shaoqing had always been a vegetarian, his body did not suffer from malnutrition and he had always maintained a good figure. ”

But now!

Cen Shaoqing had actually taken the initiative to eat meat dishes!

It was simply a wonder in the world.

“”Zixu, you’ve changed.”Yu Niannian walked to Cen Shaoqing’s side and said. ”

Cen Shaoqing turned his eyes slightly. “How have you changed?”

“”I’m not like you.”Yu Niannian continued, “You’ve never eaten meat dishes before.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing picked up a drumstick and said in a low voice, “Maybe this is the power of love!” ”

“After saying that, CEN Shaoqing added, “A person like you who is destined to be alone will never understand.” ”

Yu Niannian:”…”

Was he showing off just like that?

“Yu Niannian continued, “Do you think there is love in this world?” ”

“Do you like to ask nonsense so much?”Cen Shaoqing asked back.

“Yu Niannian looked at Cen Shaoqing and said, “Won’t the two of you break up?” ”

“No matter how beautiful a love was, it would never be able to withstand the torment of time. ”

“Although Cen Shaoqing’s love for ye Zao was now flourishing, there would eventually come a day when it would dissipate. ”

“Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads, his eyes filled with determination. “No.” ”

He and ye Zao would never be separated.

“”That’s not necessarily true.”Yu Luonian shook his head and continued, “I never believe that there is any love in the world.” ”

“You are too pitiful.”Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips opened slightly.

“”Pitiful?”Yu Niannian looked at Cen Shaoqing, his eyes filled with disbelief. ”

Who Did Cen Shaoqing say was pitiful?

He was pitiful?

How could he be pitiful?

“He could change four or five girls a day, how could Cen Shaoqing? ”

“If they did not break up, Cen Shaoqing would only be able to stay by Ye Zhuo’s side until he was old. ”

What was so good about staying by one woman for the rest of his life?

“If he had planted a hundred flowers, wouldn’t it smell good? ”

“”You say I’m Pitiful?”Yu twilight looked at Cen Shaoqing incredulously, his eyes filled with question marks. ”

“CEN shaoqing retorted, “People who don’t even want to believe in love naturally have never experienced love. Isn’t it pitiful?” ”

“”It’s not that I’ve never experienced love, I just don’t believe in love! Do you understand if I don’t believe in it? You’re the one who’s truly pitiful! I can have the love of many girls at the same time, can you do it?” ”

“After saying that, Yu Shaoqing continued, “What About You? Can you do it?” ”

Cen Shaoqing smiled and shook his head. “It seems that you really don’t understand love.”

A person who truly understood love would never say such words.

Yu Shaoqing was so angry that he was about to die.

“Cen Shaoqing was the one who should be pitiful, yet cen Shaoqing treated him like this. ”

“Those who were involved were confused, but those who watched from the sidelines were clear! ”

“I…”CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“”Do you want to eat mushrooms?”At this moment, ye Zhuo walked over from the side and handed CEN Shaoqing a bunch of roasted mushrooms. ”

“Eat.”Cen Shaoqing took the roasted mushrooms from ye Zhuo’s hands.

“”Mr. Yu, do you want to eat?”Ye Zhuo continued to ask. ”

“Yu Niannian originally wanted to say that he didn’t want to eat, but his words turned into “Thank you.” ”

“After taking the mushrooms from ye Zhuo, Yu Niannian took a bite. ”

“After he gently opened it, a fresh and sweet juice burst out from his mouth, followed by a faint cumin and chili flavor. ”

“The combination of sweet and slightly spicy didn’t make people feel disgusted. On the contrary, it was exceptionally delicious, making people unable to stop eating it. ”

Just three words.

It was very delicious.

“Yu Luonian looked at the roasted mushroom in his hand, and his expression was a little complicated. ”

“Is the Mushroom Delicious?”Cen Shaoqing asked in a low voice.

“Yes.”Yu sunset nodded his head honestly.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “My fiancée baked them.” ”

Yu Sunset:”…”

When did Cen Shaoqing become a wife-flaunting maniac?

…

On the other side.
