The two of them came to the side hall next door.

Old Mrs. Cen looked at Zhou Xiang. “What do you think of that Zhou Rui?”

“Zhou Xiang said, “He looks alright, but he’s a little younger. He doesn’t look that steady.””

There was a difference of eighteen years!

“”Age is not a problem.”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “I think that pretty boy with a glib tongue is not a good person. This fourth girl must have been deceived by him!””

“After saying that, old Mrs. Cen continued, “The fourth girl is a simple-minded person. If this matter is really successful, she will have to suffer in the future!””

“Then what do you mean?”Zhou Xiang asked.

“”I don’t agree with this matter,”old Mrs. Cen said.”

“Zhou xiang smiled and said, “Then you think the same as me. I also think that the two of them are not suitable to stand together. That Lu Xiu from before is not bad. Unfortunately, these two people are not fated.””

“Old Madam Cen nodded and said in agreement, “I also feel that Lu Xiu is not bad.””

“Although Lu Xiu was younger than Cen Yuyan, he was very steady and had his own field in the scientific and technological world.”

“Old Madam Cen sighed. “There are so many children in the family, but this fourth girl is the most worrying one. Age alone does not increase intelligence! She’s almost forty years old, and she’s always in a Daze!””

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Oh right, go and call the eldest girl over. I want to hear what the sisters have to say.””

“Okay.”Zhou Xiang nodded and turned to the hall to call Cen Yuying.

“Soon, Zhou Xiang brought Cen Yuying in.”

“Grandma.”

“Old Mrs. Cen said, “Eldest girl, what do you think of the boyfriend that the fourth girl found?””

“Cen Yuying shook her head. “He’s too young. He’s only twenty-one years old. Let’s not talk about anything else. Just his age alone is not suitable for the fourth girl. Also, I keep feeling that there’s something wrong with his eyes...””

“CEN yuying paused at this point, she continued, “Under normal circumstances, a twenty-one-year-old boy would not like a woman eighteen years older than him. I keep feeling that he’s here for the fourth girl’s money and our family’s background.””

“If Cen Yuyan wasn’t the Cen family’s fourth miss, would Zhou Rui take another look at Cen Yuyan?”

Definitely not.

“”In that case, you sisters don’t think well of the fourth girl and Zhou Rui either?”Old Mrs. Cen asked.”

Cen Yuying nodded.

“Although Cen Yueya and Cen Yueying didn’t say anything, Cen Yuying could tell that the two of them didn’t think much of Zhou Rui either.”

In the main hall.

Zhou Xiang called Cen Yuying to the side hall and did not come out for more than ten minutes. Anyone with a discerning eye knew what they were discussing.

“Zhou Rui was already quite nervous, and now he was even more nervous.”

Cen Yuyan was not worried at all.

“Zhou Rui was so good, so there was no reason for old Madam Cen and Zhou Xiang not to like Zhou Rui.”

“In a moment, Old Madam Cen, Zhou Xiang, and Cen Yuying walked out of the side hall.”

The Cen family was happily chatting with each other. Zhou Rui sat on the chair and felt quite uncomfortable.

“Cen Yuyan wanted to change the topic to Zhou Rui, but she couldn’t get a word in.”

“Today was obviously the day she brought Zhou Rui back to meet the parents, but what was the Cen family doing in this state?”

Did they know who was the main character today?

“Cen Yuyan was already feeling uncomfortable, and now it was even more uncomfortable.”

“If not for Zhou Rui’s presence, she would have left immediately.”

“Soon, it was time for dinner.”

“Zhou Xiang looked at Zhou Rui and smiled. “Little Zhou, it’s time for dinner. Why Don’t you stay at home and have a casual meal?””

Casual?

Stay at home and have a casual meal?

Shouldn’t Zhou Xiang have a special banquet to entertain Zhou Rui?

“After all, Zhou Rui was Zhou Xiang’s future son-in-law.”

“In Cen Yuyan’s eyes, Zhou Xiang had always been a fair and just mother.”

“But today, Cen Yuyan was extremely disappointed in Zhou Xiang.”

“Zhou Rui also faintly heard that something was wrong with this sentence and said with a smile, “Then Auntie, I Won’t disturb you. I’ll be leaving first.””

Song Chenyu was still the smartest.

“Before meeting the parents, song Chenyu had only revealed the attitude of the Cen family members, so he specially instructed Zhou Rui not to use a cold face to snub him.”

Cen Yuyan’s personality was especially strange.

“If Zhou Rui acted too lowly in front of the Cen family members, it would instead disappoint Cen Yuyan.”

“In front of Cen Yuyan, Zhou Rui had to have his own true personality.”

Only a different Zhou Rui could attract Cen Yuyan’s eyes.

“If Zhou Rui fawned over the Cen family, then he would be no different from Cen Yuyan’s previous boyfriends.”Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com
