Ye Zhuo looked up slightly. “I’m taking the driver’s license test.”

Taking the driver’s license test?

“”You, you don’t have a driver’s license yet?” ”

“Yes.”

Everyone was stunned.

How could a person who didn’t even have a driver’s license be so good at driving?

How could they bear the fact that they had a driver’s license?

“Ye Zhuo turned to look at the coach. “Coach Wu, can you tell me how to make an appointment for the test now?” ”

“Coach Wu was completely convinced. She continued, “You can make an appointment by downloading the 12123 app.” ”

“”Okay, thank you. I got it.”Ye Zhuo unfastened her seatbelt. “Then I’ll go back first.” ”

“After saying that, Ye Zhuo opened the door and got out of the car. ”

“Seeing her open the door and get out of the car, the people surrounding the car automatically made way for her. ”

“At this moment, ye Zao still didn’t know. ”

A video of a race was already trending on the internet.

“After leaving the driving school, ye Zao passed by a milk tea shop. ”

The weather was hot.

Ye Zao went in to buy milk tea.

“Just as he ordered the milk tea, a pleasantly surprised male voice came from behind. “Ye Zao?” ”

Ye Zao looked back slightly and saw Li Boyang. Two male classmates were standing beside him.

“Li Boyang continued, “Are you here to buy milk tea too?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Li Boyang continued, “These two are my classmates, Wei Jun and Qian Wenbin.” ”

“Hello.”Ye Zhuo smiled politely.

“”Hello, your kumquat lemon tea is ready.”The shop assistant’s voice came from behind. ”

“”Thank you.”Ye Zhuo turned around and took the lemon tea, then said to Li Boyang, “I’ll go back first.” ”

“Li Boyang wanted to say something more, but she had already walked out of the door. ”

“Just as ye Zhuo left, Wei Jun and Qian Wenbin asked curiously, “Who was that beauty just now, Li Boyang? Isn’t she too beautiful?” ”

“Her name is Ye Zhuo.”

“”Ye Zhuo?”Wei Jun continued, “Which school is she from? Can you introduce us?” ”

“Li Boyang glanced at Wei Jun, “She’s going to be my girlfriend soon, don’t let your imagination run wild.” ”

Wei Jun had only scored over 400 points in the college entrance examination.

How could ye Zhuo fall for him?

“You want to pursue her?”Wei Jun asked.

“Yes.”Li Boyang nodded.

“Wei Jun looked outside the door, “She’s so beautiful, will she fall for You?” ”

“Li Boyang’s eyes flashed with confidence. “Don’t worry, she’ll definitely agree to it!” ”

“Qian Wenbin said speechlessly, “Are you that confident? What if she doesn’t agree to it?” ”

Ye Zao was too beautiful.

She was the kind that could blow up the streets if she walked out.

“Li Boyang stood beside her. At most, he could make do with what he saw. ”

Only if ye Zao was blind would he take a fancy to Li Boyang.

“She will!”

Li Boyang knew ye Zao too well.

A person with a low academic background yearned to be with a person with a high academic background.

This could make up for her shortcomings.

“Now, not only did he get into a university, but he was also in Qinghua University. ”

It was impossible for ye Zao not to agree to him.

“Li Boyang continued, “Just you wait! Ye Zao will definitely become my girlfriend! When the time comes, I will bring her to treat you to milk tea.” ”

“What if she doesn’t agree to it?”The guards asked.

“Qian Wenbin said, “How about this? If ye Zao doesn’t agree to it, you can take over the stinky socks for me and the guards this month. How about that?” ”

“”Sure!”Li Boyang said, “If she agrees to it, you have to wash my stinky socks for a month!” ”

“Okay! No problem.”

Time passed quickly.

“In the blink of an eye, another three days passed. ”

“Zhao Pingting felt more and more uncomfortable these few days, as if she couldn’t breathe. ”

Her chest was still very painful.

“But fortunately, she could still hold on. ”

After work.

She went to the pharmacy to buy painkillers.

There were still three months left.

She had to hold on for these three months.

She just came out of the pharmacy.

Then she ran into Zhao Yingjun who had just come back from work.

“Zhao Yingjun asked curiously, “Pingting, are you not feeling well?” ”

“Zhao pingting smiled and said, “No, I’m just feeling a little uncomfortable with my throat. I’m going to buy some throat lozenges.” ”

“OH.”Zhao Yingjun nodded suspiciously.

“At night, when she was sleeping. ”

Zhao Yingjun and Tang Jia were chatting and talking about Zhao Pingting’s unusual behavior in the past two days.

“”Tang Jia, have you noticed that Pingting has lost a lot of weight recently? She doesn’t look too good either.” ” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Tang Jia was putting on a facial mask and said casually, “Hasn’t she been losing weight recently? It’s normal for her to lose weight!” ”

“Zhao Yingjun frowned and still felt that something was wrong. “Losing weight doesn’t have to make her look so bad, right? I even saw her coming out of the pharmacy today! Tang Jia, do you think something happened to Pingting?” ”
