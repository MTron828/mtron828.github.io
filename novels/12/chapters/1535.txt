“It’s really different.”Muse nodded.

“Tina frowned. “Kara, Muse, don’t tell me you guys don’t want to sign the betting agreement with YC?” ”

“”How can that be!”Dr. Kara chuckled. “One thing is another. I really admire YC, but that’s just admiration. As for the betting agreement, I must do it!” ”

Who did not want to make their country stronger?

“As long as they had the authority to manage the research base in China, the status of country C among the many countries would be more stable! ”

Gamira narrowed her eyes. “The Chinese are good at scheming. I suspect that YC set us up for today’s matter.”

“Set up?”Ovis did not understand what gamira meant. “What do you mean?”

“Gamira explained, “Let me ask you, do you all have a good impression of YC now, to the point that you don’t even have the heart to fulfill the bet agreement?” ”

“Other than Cara who did not nod, everyone else hurriedly nodded. ”

“”So, this is a trap!”Gamira continued, “YC is too sinister, I advise everyone to stay away from her.” ”

Why did YC sign the bet so readily?

It was because the whole internet was aware of it and they could not step down.

“They could not step down, and they could not bear the responsibility. They could only grit their teeth and sign the agreement. Then, they used a ploy to delude themselves into becoming friends with them. They were trying to turn a big issue into a small one, and a small one into nothing. ”

Did she really think that everyone else was a fool?

Little did she know that he had long seen through her little schemes. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Muse nodded. “Gamira’s analysis is right. In short, we must all work together and stand firm no matter what happens!” ”

“”Yes, we know.”The few of them nodded. ”

“On this side, Ye Zhuo had just walked out of the airport hotel when his phone rang. ”

Ye Zhuo picked up the phone. “Hello.”

“”Leader, are you done?”A low voice came from the other end of the phone. ”

“I just sent Dr. Cara and the others away.”Ye Zao looked at the surrounding lights.

“Where are they now?”Cen Shaoqing continued to ask.

“Ye Zao continued, “They’re at the airport hotel.” ”

“Give me ten minutes.”

“Before ye Zao could answer, the other end of the phone hung up. ”

Ye Zao couldn’t help but laugh.

“At this moment, the driver brought the car over. “Miss.” ”

“Ye Zao looked up slightly. “Uncle Wang, you can go back first.” ”

“”What About You?”Uncle Wang said worriedly, “It’s already very late!” ”

Ye Zao had brought Professor Cara and the others out for an entire day. It was already eleven o’clock at night.

“It’s alright. Cen Shaoqing will come and pick me up soon.”

Uncle Wang opened the door and got out of the car. “Then I’ll wait here with you.”

“”It’s okay, uncle Wang. You should go back quickly!” ”

Uncle Wang was a very responsible person. He was determined to wait for Cen Shaoqing with Ye Zhuo.

“Helpless, Ye Zhuo could only agree to wait with uncle Wang. ”

“At eleven o’clock at night, there were no more cars on the road. ”

Boom Boom Boom —

“The rumbling sound of a bicycle engine could be heard from the roadside. Then, a cool blue sports car appeared in everyone’s sight. ”

It was extremely fast.

“After a beautiful tailspin, the sports car stopped beside ye Zao. ”

“Cen Shaoqing was a very quiet person. Other than the time when he raced with Ye Zao in Yun Jing, he rarely drove a car like this. He also rarely drove a sports car, even though Cen Shaoqing was still the same as before, dressed in a long robe and holding a Buddhist bead in his hand, ye Zao saw a different person. ”

A wild and unruly him.

The car door opened automatically.

“Cen Shaoqing looked back slightly. “Leader, get in the car.” ”

“”Okay.”Ye Zhuo leaned into the car and looked at Uncle Wang. “Uncle Wang, you should go back quickly.” ”

“”Yes, Miss!”Uncle Wang nodded. ”

“Seeing the sports car disappear at the end of the road, uncle Wang drove back. ”

Buddhist music was playing in the sports car.

“Cen Shaoqing looked back slightly. “Leader, let me change a song for you.” ”

“”No need,”ye Zhuo said calmly. “It’s good to purify the soul.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips curved slightly, and the corners of his mouth curved slightly. “By the way, Grandma’s sweet soup is in the incubator.” ”

The Grandma Cen Shaoqing was referring to was naturally ye Langhua.

“You went to my Grandma’s Place?”Ye Zhuo asked.

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Ye Zhuo took out the sweet soup and said, “Speaking of which, I haven’t seen my grandmother for a long time.”Ever since he met ye Shu and her mother, ye Langhua and ye Shu stayed together for half a year. In the following days, ye Langhua returned to the small half month and reopened the small half month. He would return about once every two to three weeks. When he was free, he would go to a nearby temple to burn incense. ”

“In the past, ye Langhua never believed in these things. Ever since she found ye Shu, she began to believe in them. ”

“Then let’s Go Tomorrow?”Cen Shaoqing looked at Ye Zao.

“Sure.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

...

On the other side.

Zhang Qingqing pushed open the hotel door. She didn’t even take off her clothes. She just laid on the bed and let out a long sigh.

What should I do!

What should I do now?

“Although an Lizi had invited Lin ze out today, Lin Ze didn’t even look at her. ”

“Lin Ze didn’t take the water that she handed him. When she talked to him, Lin Ze also chose to ignore her... ”

“In short, in Lin Ze’s eyes, she was like an invisible person, even more invisible than air. ”

“As she counted the days, she couldn’t wait any longer. ”

“If she waited any longer, her stomach would swell. ”

“Ah!”Zhang Qingqing screamed.

“At this moment, Zhang Qingqing suddenly thought of a solution. ”

“Perhaps, she could use this method to take a gamble! ”

Three days later.

Today was Zhang Qingqing’s birthday.

An Lizi naturally wouldn’t miss her birthday.

“From their interactions that day, Zhang Qingqing could tell that the person buttface liked wasn’t her at all, but an Lizi. ”

“Therefore, as long as an Lizi appeared, dog two would definitely be there. ”

“If dog two was there, Lin Ze and the others would definitely appear as well. ”

“Early in the morning, an Lizi came to see Zhang Qingqing with a gift. “Qingqing, Happy Birthday.” ”

“Thank you.”Zhang Qingqing accepted the flowers and gift with both hands.

An Lizi had prepared a scarf.

“It was a semi-luxury item and cost 1,200 yuan. During the discount season, it only cost 950 yuan. ”

“Seeing this gift, Zhang Qingqing was a little angry. ”

Who was an Lizi looking down on.

“The Lin family was so rich, yet she only gave her a small shabby scarf. ”

She had thought that an Lizi would at least give her a six-figure handbag.

It turned out that she was thinking too much.

What was she to an Lizi?

Where was the beggar?

“Although she was very angry, Zhang Qingqing tried her best to hold it in. She smiled and said, “Thank you, Lizi. In this strange city, only you can remember my birthday.” ”

“”We grew up together. We’ve been friends for so many years. It’s too polite to say thank you,”an Lizi said. ”

“”Thank you.”Zhang Qingqing squeezed out two drops of crocodile tears, then she said, “Lizi, I still have some things to do during the day. Let’s go out tonight and sing. Call some of your friends. It’ll be more lively with more people. As you know, I don’t have many friends in the capital!” ”

“”Okay.”An Lizi nodded. “Then I’ll arrange the KTV. When I’m done, I’ll send you the address.” ”

“Okay.”

“After leaving Zhang Qingqing’s side, an Lizi went to arrange the hotel. She was prepared to personally arrange it, so that Zhang Qingqing could feel the warmth of home in this foreign land. ”
