Translator: 549690339

“”It’s no trouble. It’s my duty to serve Madam,”clan leader Qing said. ”

“Duanmu Huang Fei continued to ask, “Clan leader Qing, will the chief really not think about those things in the future?” ”

“”Duanmu Huang Fei, you really have a good plan!” ”

“At this moment, a dignified voice suddenly appeared in the air. ”

“Hearing this, everyone was stunned. ”

This voice...

Was It Cen Haifeng’s?

“Looking Up, it was indeed Cen Haifeng. ”

“Duanmu huangfei smiled and pretended that nothing had happened. “Haifeng, you’re awake.” ”

“Cen Haifeng did not look at Duanmu huangfei and continued, “Ouyang Li, Zhao Guoshi, how dare you use forbidden techniques on me!” ”

Ouyang Li and Zhao Guoshi were the names of the great elder and the National Master.

“”Mr. , Mr. Chief Alliance...”the great elder’s legs were shaking. ”

The National Master was also a little flustered.

“Cen Haifeng looked like he had not forgotten anything, right? ”

Clan leader Qing was also a little confused. It shouldn’t be!

“The whole process was so smooth, how could Cen Haifeng Not Forget Anything? ”

Clan leader Qing really couldn’t figure out what went wrong.

“At this moment, Cen Hai Feng turned to clan leader Qing and said, “From today onwards, the forbidden clan will forever ban the use of forbidden techniques. Those who violate this will be expelled from their nationality and exiled to the insect clan!” ”

The insect clan was the most terrifying planet.

“The criminals of Chang Yue, man Xing and the Allied countries were mostly imprisoned to the insect clan. ”

“Being locked up in the insect clan, under normal circumstances, there were only two outcomes. ”

Waiting to die and being eaten.

“Hearing this, clan leader Qing’s back was covered in layers of cold sweat. ”

“Their forbidden clan relied on this to survive. If they were not allowed to use forbidden techniques, how would they live in the future? ”

“Cen Haifeng seemed to have seen through his thoughts and continued, “As ordinary people live, you will live as YOU LIVE!” ”

“At this moment, chief Qing had no choice but to lower his head. “Yes.” ”

“Cen Hai Feng continued, “The two of you go back and wait for the notice.” ”

The National Master and the Great Elder were the leaders of the alliance. They could not touch them casually for the time being. They had to think of a foolproof plan.

“Hearing this, the Great Elder and the National Master looked at each other and saw doubt in each other’s eyes. ”

Wait for the notice?

Waiting for what notice?

Had Cen Haifeng Forgotten Everything?

“Cen Haifeng pressed his temples and said, “Let’s go back first. I’m tired.” ”

“Yes.”The National Master and the Grand Elder turned around and left.

“Duanmu fenghuang immediately walked forward. “Haifeng, let me help you in to rest.” ”

Cen Haifeng avoided Duanmu Fenghuang’s hand.

“Duanmu Fenghuang’s expression was a little stiff at this moment, but she quickly recovered and followed Cen Haifeng’s footsteps. ”

She couldn’t figure out what Cen Haifeng was thinking.

“”You should go back too,”Cen Haifeng said. ”

“”I’ll stay with you,”Duanmu Fengfei said. “The Doctor said that you’ll have to stay in the hospital for two days.” ”

“”Duanmu Fengfei, you don’t have to act in front of me anymore. I’ve thought of everything. You should go back and clean up. I’ve already asked someone to cancel our marriage.” ”

“From then on, Duanmu Fengfei had nothing to do with him. ”

“Hearing this, Duanmu Fengfei’s face instantly turned pale. “W-what did you say?” ”

“I’ve already said it clearly enough.”Cen Haifeng turned to look at her. “Do you want me to repeat it again?”

“Cen Haifeng’s face was gentle, and there was not even a hint of anger in his eyes. He was so calm that it seemed as if he was discussing with Duanmu fengfei what to eat the next morning. ”

PA —

“Duanmu Fengfei could not stay calm anymore. She swept the vase on the table away and looked at Cen Haifeng with tears in her eyes. “Cen Haifeng, I have accompanied you for twenty years, twenty years! What have I been in your heart for these twenty years?” ”

“Twenty years of marriage and companionship, and in the end, this was the result. ”

“”My marriage with you has always been a lie,”cen haifeng continued, “If my forbidden spell was lifted, do you think I would be with you?” ”

Absolutely Not!

But Duanmu Huangfei did not think so.

“She was more beautiful than Zhou Xiang on Earth, and she was born better than her. No matter who it was, they would choose her instead of Zhou Xiang! ”

“”Excuses, these are all your excuses! You just see me as Old and yellow, and my youth is gone! Cen Haifeng, Why Can’t you have a little bit of conscience?” ”

“”You can go.”Cen Haifeng’s voice was very calm. Compared to the angry Duanmu huangfei, he was so calm that it was as if nothing had happened. “I don’t want to argue with you.” ”

He also didn’t have the energy to argue.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m
