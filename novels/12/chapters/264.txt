Ranked 89th in the city.

“688 points had already exceeded the key points. Although it was a little difficult to go to Beijing University, there was still no problem for him to go to Qinghua University. ” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Seeing this score, Li Boyang was extremely excited. ”

He quickly ran downstairs.

“Mom! My results are out!”

“It was daytime, and the barbecue shop was not open yet. Qian Lingyu was cleaning up. When she heard this, she said excitedly, “Boyang, how many points did you get?” ”

“688!”Li Boyang answered.

“Really?”Qian Lingyu’s face was full of joy.

Li Boyang nodded. “It can’t be wrong.”

“Qian Lingyu put her hands together. “Buddha bless! It’s really Buddha bless!”Qian Lingyu’s nephew was also taking the college entrance exam this year. A few days ago, her sister-in-law called to show off that her nephew got a high score of 654 points. ”

She didn’t expect Li Boyang to score 688 points!

A full 34 points higher than her nephew.

Don’t look at the difference of only 34 points.

“In the college entrance exam, a difference of 34 points was equivalent to a difference in the Milky Way galaxy. ”

“Li Boyang could go to a famous school, with a focus of 985 points. ”

And her nephew could only go to a single college.

“Boyang! You’ve really done your mother proud this time!”

Li Boyang himself was very happy.

He had finally lived up to his mother’s expectations.

And he had also lived up to his own expectations.

Qinghua University!

And Ye Zao.

“If ye Zao knew that he had scored 688 points, he would definitely be in disbelief. ”

Li Boyang only wanted to immediately bring his report card and stand in front of ye Zao to share this joy with him.

“Then, he would conveniently confess to ye Zao. ”

He was a Qinghua student.

Ye Zao was a junior high school student.

Ye Zao would definitely feel honored to have a boyfriend from Qinghua University.

It would be a great honor to bring him out to meet his friends.

It would also be a great honor to tell his relatives and friends at home.

Li Boyang immediately picked up his phone and asked ye Zao to meet him.

He wanted to confess to ye Zao immediately!

...

Zhao Pingting’s stomach hurt a little today.

“Hence, she stood up to Ye Zao and the others. ”

“She had initially thought that she would be fine after taking some medicine, but who knew that the pain would still be unbearable after taking the medicine. Hence, she could only go to the hospital to have a look. ”

“After going to the hospital, the Doctor said that he wanted to do a CT scan. ”

“After a series of examinations, the doctor’s expression did not look too good. “Young Lady, did you come alone?” ”

Zhao pingting nodded.

“Where are your parents?”

“Zhao pingting said, “My parents are both at work.” ”

“The doctor frowned. “Other than your parents, is there no one else in your family?” ”

“”I have an elder brother and sister-in-law, but they are also at work.”Zhao Pingting felt that her chest pain was much better now. She smiled and said, “Doctor, if you have anything to say, just tell me directly. I am already an adult.” ”

“The doctor looked at Zhao Pingting with a complicated expression. “Young Lady, are you this year’s college entrance exam candidate?” ”

“”Yes.”Zhao pingting nodded. “Doctor, what does my illness have to do with the college entrance exam?” ”

“The doctor poured Zhao pingting a glass of water. “Young lady, sit down.” ”

“Zhao Pingting took the glass of water with both hands. She felt that things were not that simple. “Doctor, AM I... Am I suffering from some incurable disease?” ”

“The doctor sighed. “Young Lady, have you been feeling a little nauseous recently, followed by a slight chest pain and cough?” ”

“”Yes.”Zhao pingting nodded and continued, “Doctor, please tell me what illness I have! I can take it!” ”

The doctor looked at Zhao Pingting.

“After a long while, he slowly said, “Lung cancer.” ”

Lung Cancer?

Zhao Pingting felt her mind go blank.

How did this happen?

How did she get cancer?

“Although the doctor was used to seeing life and death, he still couldn’t bear to see Zhao Pingting like this. “Young Lady, medicine is so advanced now. As long as you cooperate with the treatment, you will definitely see Hope.” ”

“According to the medical records, Zhao Pingting was only 19 years old this year. ”

She was still a child...

“Zhao Pingting tried very hard to calm herself down. “Then, what is my current situation? Early or late stage?” ”

“Middle or late stage.”

“Hearing this, Zhao Pingting’s originally bright eyes dimmed in an instant, like stars that had lost their luster. ”

“However, she still forced a smile. “Then there’s no meaning to the treatment.” ”

“”Young lady, don’t be like this. No matter what, you have to give it a try. You’re still so young. Even if there’s only a 1% chance, you can’t give up.” ”

“Zhao Pingting smiled. “Doctor, my grandmother also died of lung cancer.” ”

It was precisely because her grandmother also died of lung cancer.

That was why she knew so much about cancer.
