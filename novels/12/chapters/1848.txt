“For a moment, Xu Xiao felt a little awkward. ”

“He ziteng immediately said, “That fifth brother is a germaphobe.” ”

“After knowing ye Zhuo, Cen Shaoqing’s personality had changed quite a lot. ”

“One had to know that before this, if Xu Xiao had greeted Cen Shaoqing, Cen Shaoqing probably would not have even nodded his head. ”

“Now, at least he was willing to nod his head at Xu Xiao. ” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Hearing this, Xu Xiao withdrew her hand somewhat awkwardly. ”

“He ziteng continued, “Fifth brother, then we won’t disturb you. When fifth sister-in-law arrives, you will greet her on our behalf.” ”

“En.”Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads and snorted lightly.

“After saying this, he ziteng brought Xu Xiao away. ”

“Walking out of the queuing area, Xu Xiao asked curiously, “So CEN fifth master really has a girlfriend! is his girlfriend the eldest daughter of the Lin Family?” ”

“Yes.”He ziteng nodded.

“Is the eldest daughter of the Lin family good-looking?”Xu Xiao asked curiously.

“He ziteng said, “Very good-looking.” ”

“Compared to me?”Xu Xiao looked at he ziteng expectantly.

She was the irreplaceable goddess in he ziteng’s heart.

“Therefore, in He ziteng’s heart, she must be the most beautiful. ”

“As for the eldest daughter of the Lin family, she had to stand aside in front of her. ”

“He ziteng turned his head slightly and looked at Xu Xiao. “The two of you are not from the same world, so you can not be compared.” ”

“Hearing this, Xu Xiao was a little unhappy! ”

What did he ziteng mean?

What did he mean by saying that she and the young miss of the Lin family were not from the same world?

Xu Xiao even suspected that she was not the goddess in he ziteng’s heart.

“What made Xu Xiao the most dissatisfied was that although he ziteng had been by her side for the past few days, he ziteng did not mention anything about being his girlfriend. ”

He ziteng had clearly said that he would wait for her.

“But now, he did not say anything. He could not let a girl like her speak first, right? ”

“The more Xu Xiao thought about it, the more annoyed she became. ”

“At this moment, Xu Xiao’s eyes lit up, as if she had thought of something. ”

Right.

This should be the way!

Another hour passed.

Ye Zhuo finally sat in the shop as she wished and ate the steaming freshly ground tofu.

“Freshly ground tofu was very different from the finished tofu she bought, regardless of whether it was the texture or the taste. ”

“Ye Zhuo ate one mouthful after another, feeling very satisfied. ”

“Seeing her like this, Cen Shaoqing suddenly felt that the two-hour wait was worth it! ”

“”Why aren’t you eating!”Ye Zhuo raised his eyes slightly. “Quick, try it. The taste of this tofu is really good.” ”

“As he finished speaking, Ye Zhuo picked up a piece of tofu and placed it into CEN Shaoqing’s bowl. ”

Cen Shaoqing took a bite.

“Ye Zhuo asked, “How is it?” ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “It’s really not bad.”

Cen Shaoqing did not send ye Zhuo home until nine o’clock in the evening.

The next day was a rest day.

“Although it was a rest day, ye Zao did not sleep in. He got up at seven in the morning to run. ”

“After running, he ate breakfast. ”

“After breakfast, he went to the study. ”

“When ye Zao walked out of the study again, it was already half past ten in the morning. ”

Ye Zao changed her clothes and was ready to go to the appointment.

“Today, she wore very simple clothes. ”

“She wore a white shirt and black jeans. Her long black hair was tied up high and tied into a bun, revealing her fair and long neck. Her entire body exuded a youthful aura. ”

“At 11:29 am, Ye Zhuo arrived at the entrance of the imperial court coffee shop on time. ”

“The moment she entered, a waiter welcomed her in. “Is that Miss Ye?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“The attendant continued, “Miss Ye, come with me.” ”

Ye Zhuo followed the attendant’s footsteps.

Only when they reached the door of the private room on the third floor did the attendant stop. “Mr. Jiuzhou will wait for you inside.”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

The attendant turned around and left.

Ye Zhuo reached out and knocked on the door.

“Very soon, the door came from inside. ”

“The person who opened the door was a very young man. “Miss Ye, please come in.” ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and raised his feet to enter.

“As soon as he entered the room, he saw a man sitting in front of the French window with his back facing her. ”

“Although it was only a back view, it gave off a sense of oppression that was beyond one’s reach, making one unable to breathe. ”

“At the same time, there was also a sense of familiarity that came with it. ”

Very familiar.

Who was this person?

Did she know him?

Ye Zhuo narrowed his eyes and opened his red lips slightly. “Mr. Nine Provinces.”

“Hearing this, the man who was sitting in front of the French window turned around slightly. ”

He revealed a face that could topple all living beings.

“His features were exquisite and his face was like a crown of jade. The sunlight shone through the window and sprinkled evenly on his face, making him appear even more abstinent. ”

This was... Cen Shaoqing!

“Surprise appeared on Ye Zhuo’s face. “Cen Shaoqing, why are you here? Where’s Jiuzhou?” ”

Cen Shaoqing curled his lips. “Didn’t I tell you that I’m nine provinces?”

Yes.

“Cen Shaoqing had said that he was nine provinces, but ye Zhuo did not take it to heart. ”

Who would have thought that Cen Shaoqing was really nine provinces!

“Are you really nine provinces?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“It’s true!”Cen Shaoqing raised his eyebrows.

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “I thought you were bragging.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing smiled and said, “Come here.” ”

Ye Zhuo walked over.

Cen Shaoqing reached out and grabbed her hand. He pulled her to his lap and sat her down.

“I’m here to talk business with you.”Ye Zhuo was about to stand up.

“Cen Shaoqing held her waist tightly and placed his chin on her shoulder. He said in a low voice, “Speak, I’ll listen.” ”

“”I have to find the memory that I lost before,”ye Zao said. ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “I know. But now is not the time.”

“Why?”Ye Zao frowned.

“Your current state is not suitable for hypnosis.”Hypnosis was a very physically exhausting thing.

“Ye Zao had not slept for five days and five nights to find Yu Zifei and the others not long ago. He was almost mentally and physically exhausted. If he forcefully hypnotized her at this time, it would definitely backfire! ”

“Then when can we do it?”Ye Zao asked.

“We’ll wait for another two days.”

“”Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly and continued, “Can you take out your phone?” ”

Phone?

“Cen Shaoqing was stunned at first, but he quickly reacted. He stood up and said, “I need to go to the bathroom.” ”

“Looking at Cen Shaoqing’s back, ye Zao frowned slightly. ”

Do I need to go to the washroom to get my phone?

“In the blink of an eye, another two days passed. ”

Ye Zao drove to the Cen family manor.

She had promised Cen Shaoqing that she would do a hypnosis today.

“When she arrived, Cen Shaoqing was about to leave the house. When he saw ye Zao coming over, Cen Shaoqing said, “Didn’t we agree that I would pick you up?” ”

“No need. I just wanted to get my hands dirty.”

“At this moment, a white samoyed rushed out of the House quickly. Its legs stepped on ye Zao’s body and gave him a warm hug. ”

“Ye Zao had some skills. If it were anyone else, they would have been knocked to the ground by the powerful impact. ”

“Great Great Grandson!”Old Mrs. Cen chased after him from the house. “Slow down! Even great grandma can’t catch up!”

“Seeing ye Zao appear outside, Old Mrs. Cen’s eyes instantly lit up. She threw away the dog leash in her hand. “Yezi! You’re here!” ”

“Great-grandmother CEN.”Ye Zao jogged over and hugged Old Mrs. Cen.

The two of them chatted for a while. Old Mrs. Cen went to walk the dog while ye Zao followed Cen Shaoqing upstairs.

The hypnosis location was chosen to be in the sunlight room on the third floor.

“Cen Shaoqing took out the hypnotic crystal. “Zhuo Zhuo, look at it. Don’t have any distracting thoughts in your mind. Slowly close your eyes.” ”
