Translator: 549690339

There were some traffic jams during this period of time. The original 30-minute journey had taken less than 40 minutes.

“In the car, Ye Shu asked an Lizi about Zhang Qingqing’s character, an Lizi said, “Qingqing grew up with me. Auntie, don’t worry. There’s nothing wrong with her character. I remember when she was young, she liked small animals very much. One time, her pet dog died and she cried for two whole days.””

“Ye Shu nodded. Listening to her, she was a very caring girl.”

“What about her family?”Ye Shu was a little annoyed by those unclear relatives.

She was also frightened by Zhou Xiang’s family.

“An lizi continued, “Her family members are very simple. There’s only one brother, and then her parents. The brother seems to have a girlfriend and is talking about marriage.””

“Ye Shu nodded. After some understanding, she was rather satisfied with Zhang Qingqing.”

“A moment later, the car stopped. The driver said, “Miss an, the address you mentioned is here!””

“Are We There Yet?”An Lizi asked.

“Yes.”The driver nodded.

An Lizi opened the window and looked around.

“With a glance, she saw Zhang Qingqing sitting by the roadside in a daze.”

“Ye Shu asked, “Is that the girl?””

“Yes.”An Lizi nodded.

Ye Shu looked over carefully.

“Zhang Qingqing was squatting on the plate, so her face couldn’t be seen clearly. Looking at her, she seemed to be a pretty obedient little girl.”

“Then let’s hurry over!”

An Lizi followed ye Shu’s footsteps.

“The two of them walked to Zhang Qingqing’s side. An lizi asked, “Qingqing, what’s wrong? What Happened?””

“Hearing an Lizi’s voice, Zhang Qingqing stood up and hugged an Lizi. She cried, “Lizi, you’re finally here! SOB SOB SOB...””

“”Child, don’t cry. Let’s talk things out.”Seeing Zhang Qingqing cry so sadly, Ye Shu couldn’t bear it.”

“Hearing the unfamiliar voice, Zhang Qingqing was stunned for a moment. She looked up at Ye Shu.”

“The person was about 30 to 40 years old. He was wearing an air-conditioning suit made of ZY technology. He had an air of nobility about him. Needless to say, he was a wealthy lady.”

There was a familiar figure between his brows.

Could This Be Lin Ze’s mother?

“Thinking of this, Zhang Qingqing narrowed her eyes. She had a plan in mind.”

“At this moment, an lizi continued, “Qingqing, let me introduce you. This is my aunt and Ah Ze’s mother.””

It seemed like her guess was right.

This person was indeed Lin Ze’s mother.

“Ye Shu immediately said, “Child, I’m Lin Ze’s mother. Ah Ze has already told me about your matter. If you have any grievances, just tell me.””

“An Lizi said, “Qingqing, don’t worry. My youngest aunt is a very good person.””

“Hearing this, Zhang Qingqing cried even more miserably.”

“”Child, What’s wrong with you?”Ye Shu supported Zhang Qingqing, “This pregnant person can’t be so emotional. Not only is it not good for adults, but it’s also very bad for the child! If you have any grievances, just tell aunt. Aunt will help you vent your anger!”” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“No matter what, Zhang Qingqing’s stomach had Lin Ze’s blood in it.”

“Although ye Shu didn’t really like Zhang Qingqing at first glance, now that things had happened, she could only accept it.”

“Moreover, an Lizi also said that Zhang Qingqing was a girl with a good character.”

“As long as her character was good, there would be no problems with Lin Ze. As a mother, she couldn’t do anything to break up the couple.”

“After all, Ye Shu herself was experienced. She didn’t want Lin Ze to experience her experience.”

“”Aunty, I know that my birth is not worthy of Lin Ze, but you can’t Insult Me! The child in my stomach is Lin Ze’s! If it wasn’t for his seed, do you think he would have proposed to marry me? “I’m doing it properly. If you don’t believe me, after the child is born, I can bring the child to have an appraisal! “But let me put it bluntly. Once the appraisal is done, this child will have nothing to do with Lin Ze in the future!””

“Ye Shu said, “Child, why would you say something like that? Did someone say something in front of you?””

“Zhang Qingqing cried very sadly. “Auntie, do you believe me?””

“”As long as Ah Ze believes you, I’ll believe you!””

“Hearing this, Zhang Qingqing was moved and hugged ye Shu. “Auntie, thank you!””

“As long as ye Shu believed in her, it was fine. Ye Zao?”

Who the hell was ye Zao!

Zhang Qingqing curled the corners of her lips.

Just wait.

She would chase ye Zao out of the Lin family sooner or later.

“”There’s no need to thank Auntie.”Ye Shu pulled Zhang Qingqing up from the ground and continued, “Tell Auntie What’s going on.””

“Zhang Qingqing took a deep breath, “Lin Ze’s sister just came to look for me. She... she suspected that the child in my stomach wasn’t Lin Ze’s. “Actually, I’m not blaming her. I understand her too. If it were me, I wouldn’t be able to accept it either! “After all, with my background, I really don’t Deserve Lin Ze. It’s normal for her to suspect me! “So, I don’t blame her. It’s because I don’t love myself. I got pregnant at a young age, but I can’t help but feel wronged. Auntie, do you know how it feels?””

“Looking at Zhang Qingqing, ye Shu felt as if she had seen herself before.”

“At that time, no one believed her either.”

But Ye Zao wasn’t the kind of person who didn’t know what was important and what wasn’t.

Unless there was some hidden reason behind this.

“Zhang Qingqing continued, “Auntie, I’ve already told Lin Ze. If Lin Ze isn’t willing to accept us, I’ll leave Beijing immediately and take the child out to live by myself! I’ll never appear in front of Lin Ze again. It was Lin Ze who proposed to get married!””

At the same time.

At the Cen family base.

Ye Zhuo received a call from ER Mao.

“Boss. I’ve already found out about the Zhang Qingqing you asked me to investigate!”

“Zhang Qingqing wasn’t a big shot. Her identity information hadn’t been encrypted. As long as she put in some effort, she would be able to find out about her.”

“”Speak,”ye Zao said concisely.”

“Er Mao continued, “This Zhang Qingqing became the mistress of an old man called Wu Youyu in May of the fifth year. She was his mistress for more than a year until Wu Youyu died in an accident in the second half of this year. Only then did the relationship end! “Then, I also found out that Zhang Qingqing was found to be pregnant in the hospital two months ago! But strangely, on the 23rd of this month, the day before yesterday, she went to the hospital again and bribed the Doctor to change the date of pregnancy on the report to one month ago.””
