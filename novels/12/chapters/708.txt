Ye Langhua waved her hand. “I can’t drink anymore.”.

“XI weiyue continued, “Even if it’s for Sister Half Moon, you have to drink more. What if Sister Half Moon comes back one day and your body collapses? What should I do?” ”

“When she heard this, Ye Langhua immediately took the bowl in Xi Weiyue’s hand and gulped down the bird’s nest. ”

Xi Weiyue narrowed her eyes.

A cold glint flashed across her eyes.

It was not wrong to say that ye Langhua was inferior to a dog.

“She was so good to Ye Langhua, but she was still inferior to that half a month who was already dead. ”

“She earnestly persuaded ye Langhua to drink all the bird’s nest, but ye Langhua refused to drink even half a mouthful. ”

“But when it came to the half a month, ye Langhua picked up the bowl and drank all of it. ”

Could it be that she was worse than a dead person?

“If it were not for ye Langhua being useful, she would not serve a crazy woman so indiscriminately. ”

“After drinking the bird’s Nest, ye Langhua put down the bowl and looked up at Xi Weiyue. “It’s getting late. Weiyue, you should go back and rest.” ”

“Xi Weiyue held ye Langhua’s hand. “Auntie, I still want to accompany you for a while.” ”

Ye Langhua patted Xi Weiyue’s hand. “Go back. I need to rest too.”

“”Okay.”XI weiyue nodded and stood up from the chair. “Then, Aunty, rest early. I Won’t disturb you anymore.” ”

Ye Langhua sent Xi Weiyue out of the door.

“On this side, Xi Weiyue had just walked out of ye Langhua’s courtyard when Yang Jiao walked out from not far away. “How is it?” ”

Xi Weiyue shook her head.

“Did you tell her about the Shunxi Financial Group?”Yang Jiao asked.

“”I did,”xi weiyue continued, “Mom, do you think we guessed wrong? The Shunxi Financial Group’s Ye family has nothing to do with Ye Langhua? “Think about it. If the Shunxi Financial Group’s Ye family really has something to do with her, it’s impossible for the Ye family to be completely silent after such a huge incident.” ”

Yang Jiao also felt that it was a little strange.

Ye Langhua’s love for Xi Weiyue was not an act.

“Now, Little Half Moon had already passed away. ”

Xi Weiyue looked so much like little half moon.

“Currently, Xi Weiyue was ye Langhua’s only heir. If ye Langhua had something to do with the Shunxi Financial Group, Ye Langhua would not just stand by and watch. ”

“Yang Jiao continued, “Even if the Shunxi Financial Group has nothing to do with Ye Langhua, that incident is still true! No matter what, we have to get that secret out of her!” ”

Xi Weiyue nodded.

...

The next morning was the first day of the New Year.

“Although ye Zhuo slept quite late last night, he woke up quite early in the morning. ”

“After washing up, Ye Zhuo went to the wardrobe to pick out some clothes. ”

“Although the temperature in the capital city had dropped to minus ten degrees Celsius, her clothes could be adjusted to the temperature, so she only needed to wear two thin clothes. ”

Today was the first day of the New Year.

“Therefore, Ye Zao chose a red coat. The sleeves of the coat were decorated with pearls, which perfectly complemented the pearls beside her ears. ”

Her skin was white.

“After the red coat on the bed, her entire face was so white that it was almost transparent. ”

Under his feet was a pair of black Martin boots.

It looked beautiful and wild.

“Ye Zao had just opened the door when little white walked over from the side. “The most beautiful person in the universe, Da Zao, Happy New Year. Congratulations on making a Fortune!” ”

“Happy New Year.”Ye Zao patted Little White’s head.

“Little White said aggrievedly, “Da Zao, it’s your fault if I become stupid in the future!” ”

“Ye Zhuoluo’s red lips parted slightly. “Don’t worry, I’ve installed the strongest AI for you. No matter what you do, you won’t become stupid.” ”

“Really?”Xiao Bai’s eyes lit up.

Ye Zhuoluo lit up the elevator. “When have I ever lied to You?”

“Xiao Bai immediately stretched his cute little head over. “Da Zhuoluo, feel free to take any pictures!” ” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Ye Zhuoluo couldn’t help but laugh.

Ding —

The elevator door opened.

Ye Zhuo walked in and pressed the button for the first floor.

“Soon, the elevator arrived at the first floor. ”

“”Happy New Year, Auntie!” ”

“The moment the elevator door opened, five little guys surrounded them. ”

“Today was the first day of the New Year. The five little guys were dressed very jubilantly, like a lucky doll. ”

“Happy New Year.”Ye Zhuo touched the heads of the five little guys.

“”Aunt, there are gold ingots in the morning. How many do you want to eat?” ”

“Gold ingots?”Ye Zao was stunned. What was that?

“Luo Luo smiled and said, “Aunt is a big idiot! She doesn’t even know about gold ingots! Gold ingots are just eggs!” ”

“There was a custom in the capital, and it was customary to call eggs on the first day of the new year gold ingots. ”

Ye Zao nodded. “Then I’ll just eat one.”
