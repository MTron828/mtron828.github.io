Auntie Lang did not let go of Little Half Moon’s hand even after they got into the car.

“However, Little Half Moon was unwilling to get close to Auntie Lang. She shook off Auntie Lang’s hand and sat beside Yang Jiao.”

Auntie Lang felt that the child hated him and her eyes could not help but turn red again.

“Yang Jiao looked up at Auntie Lang. “Sister, don’t be anxious. Why Don’t you stay at home for the next few days and spend more time with the child? After a while, she’ll naturally become intimate with you.””

Xi Muwen nodded. “Yang Jiao is right.”

“Aunty Lang continued, “Does Little Half Moon have any other family members?””

“Xi Muwen shook his head, “When we found her at the aid station, she was alone. She didn’t know what to ask her... “However, according to the staff at the aid station, she had been wandering for a long time before we found her ... So, she shouldn’t have any other family members.””

The sentence “Wandering for a long time”hurt Aunt Lang’s heart again.

“Back then, Little Half Moon was smart and cute. If it weren’t for her, Little Half Moon wouldn’t have become like this.”

It was all her fault.

It was all her fault.

“Xi Weiyue quickly comforted Aunt Lang. “Aunt, don’t be sad. No matter what, Sister Half Moon has been found now. Let bygones be bygones.””

“Xi muwen said, “Weiyue is right. Thankfully, Little Half Moon has already been found. Even if you’re sad and guilty, it’s useless. Why Don’t you be more practical?””

“The car was very fast, and they arrived at the Xi family home in no time.”

“When they got out of the car, Little Half Moon was still holding onto Yang Jiao’s clothes tightly. She did not dare to go near Aunty Lang. She looked like she was some kind of monster that ate people.”

“”Little Half Moon, let me hold your hand, okay? I’m your mother...”” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Little Half Moon hid behind Yang Jiao and looked at Aunt Lang warily.

“Xi Weiyue smiled as she looked at Aunt Lang, then, she said, “Aunt, why don’t we give Sister Half Moon some time to recover?”? Since they still had a lot of time to spend together in the future, there was no need to be in a hurry. I’ll first bring you to see the room my father prepared for Sister Half Moon. You can see if you want to add anything else.””

“Okay.”Aunt Lang wiped her tears.

“Xi Weiyue brought Aunt Lang to a sunny master bedroom on the third floor. “Look, this is Sister Half Moon’s room.””

The room was obviously decorated.

“A luxurious princess bed, thick carpet, all-european furniture...”

Aunt Lang was stunned. “Isn’t this your room?”

“Xi Weiyue smiled. “My father said that he owed Sister Half Moon too much these years, so he made my room available for Sister Half Moon. Actually, aunt, in my father’s heart, Sister Half Moon is much more important than me. In the past, before he found Sister Half Moon, my father would take a photo of Sister Half Moon several times a day! “She even secretly wiped her tears. Now that Sister Half Moon has been found, can you forgive my father?””

Aunt Lang sighed. “Let bygones be bygones!”

“It had been so long, and now that Half Moon had been lost and regained, Aunt Lang no longer wanted to dwell on the past.”

She was too tired from this life.

“For the next few days, she only wanted to stay by her daughter’s side and not do anything that she would regret.”

“XI weiyue said, “So you’re willing to forgive my father? If My father knew that you’ve forgiven him, he would definitely be very happy.””

“Aunt Lang walked into the room to take a look, then said, “Actually, your father doesn’t need you to vacate the room at all. Anyway, half a month won’t be long here.””

Xi Weiyue narrowed her eyes when she heard this.

Won’t stay here for long?

Could it be that ye Langhua wanted to bring that crazy woman out to live?

“”Aunt, are you going to bring sister half a month away?””

Ye Langhua nodded. “I want to bring her to the courtyard house.”

“XI weiyue continued, “Whether you bring sister Weiyue or not, this is my father’s kind gesture. This is also his love for sister Weiyue. I’ve lived by my father’s side for so many years, but sister half a month has suffered so much outside. My father wants to give everything to compensate her.””

Aunt Lang sighed.

It seemed that Xi Muwen’s life these years was not much easier than hers.

“Speaking of which, it was indeed not Xi Muwen’s fault when the child was lost.”

“After all, she was the one who lost half moon.”

“After so many years, she should let it go.”

“Then.., xI weiyue continued, “If you want to take Sister Half Moon away, I hope you can bring sister half moon back to see her. You know my father very well. He’s obsessed with his face and suffers a lot. If you don’t bring Sister Half Moon back, he definitely won’t be able to take the initiative to look for you.””
