He did not expect the tables to be turned today.

“How outstanding was ye Zhuo in school? That was why he, his uncle, benefited from it! ”

Zhou Jinbei was a businessman. He had a good eye for people.

He could tell that the respect in the counselor’s eyes was not an act.

“Zhou jinbei continued, “Counselor, you don’t have to work. I’m not thirsty.” ”

“The counselor smiled and said, “Then green tea it is! Bosses like you all like to drink green tea.”As he spoke, he went to make tea. ”

Zhou Jinbei felt like he was dreaming.

He really wanted to film this scene and let Zhou Zeyan take a look.

“After a while, the counselor handed the steaming hot green tea to Zhou Jinbei. “Uncle, drink it slowly. Be careful not to burn it.” ”

Zhou Jinbei took the green tea with both hands. “Thank you.”

“”You’re welcome.”The counselor sat down opposite Zhou Jinbei. “Uncle, is your eldest nephew Student Ye’s boyfriend?” ”

“Yes.”Zhou Jinbei nodded.

“The counselor sighed. “Your eldest nephew must have saved the solar system in his previous life to become student ye’s boyfriend in this life! “You must help me tell him to treat our student ye well. Otherwise, our entire chemistry department will not let him go.” ”

Ye Zhuo was too outstanding.

The counselor had been in the industry for so many years and had seen many geniuses.

“However, it was the first time he had seen such a perverted genius like Ye Zhuo! ”

Some people had high IQ and low eq.

“However, Ye Zao was not like this. ”

“Not only was her IQ high, but her EQ was also unusually high. ”

“Zhou jinbei smiled and said, “Don’t worry, my eldest nephew is a very responsible person. Otherwise, Zao Zao would not have taken a fancy to him. He would not bully Zao Zao.” ”

“The instructor adjusted his glasses and continued, “Actually, even if he wanted to bully classmate Ye, he might not be able to do so.” ”

“It was said that ye Zhuo’s skills were also very good. During military training, he had defeated the instructor in less than three moves. ”

“The instructors of Beijing University were all serious military officers who had received strict training. Not to mention ordinary people, even a martial artist might not be a match for him. ”

Not long after.

“Footsteps sounded outside the door, followed by a knock on the door. ”

“Student ye must be here.”The instructor raised his head. “Come in.”

Zhou Jinbei looked down at his watch.

“It was exactly 12:10 in the afternoon, which coincided with the ten minutes the counselor said. ”

Ka —

The door opened.

“A slender figure walked in from outside. She was wearing a wide mask. The mask was obviously a little big, which made her face look small and exquisite. ”

“As Ye Zao walked, she took off her mask, revealing a face as delicate as jade. The bright light shone on her porcelain-white face without any flaws. “Counselor, Uncle.” ”

The counselor nodded at Ye Zao.

Zhou Jinbei stood up from his chair. “Zao Zao.”

“Ye Zao casually put the mask into his pocket. “Uncle, let’s talk outside.” ”

“Okay.”Zhou Jinbei followed ye Zao’s footsteps.

There was a high-end coffee shop in the Western District of Beijing University.

“Although the expenses were high, the environment was indeed good. ”

“The two of them came to the coffee shop, and ye Zao ordered a cappuccino. ”

Zhou Jinbei ordered a cup of Blue Mountain Coffee.

“Only when the coffee was served did Zhou Jinbei get into the main topic. He took out an envelope and handed it to ye Zao. “Zao Zao, this is the original. See if you can repair it.” ”

“Ye Zao took the envelope and opened it to take a look. Just like in the photo, this letter was very badly damaged. In some places, one could not even see the ink. ”

“Not only that, there were also serious creases. ”

“Based on current technology, it was indeed difficult to repair, but it was not difficult for ye Zao to do so. ”

“After taking a look, ye Zao put it back into the envelope. “It can be repaired. If it’s fast, it’ll take five days. If it’s slow, it’ll take a week.” ”

“Hearing this, Zhou Jinbei heaved a sigh of relief. “Zao Zao, then I’ll leave it to you.” ”

“”Of course.”Ye Zhuo continued, “Oh right, I still have to thank uncle for the gift. It’s such a big pink diamond.” ”

“Zhou jinbei smiled and said, “Zhuozhuo, you’re saying that because you’re shabbily shabbily shabbily shabbily shabbily shabbily shabbily shabbily shabbily shabbily. How can a diamond of that grade be considered a pink diamond? That kind of supreme grade diamond is called a real pink diamond! “Unfortunately, the diamond mine has been too heavily mined these few years. I haven’t encountered a supreme grade pink diamond in many years. But don’t worry, when Uncle Encounters a supreme grade pink diamond, uncle will definitely keep it for you!” ”

“Zhou Jinbei only had one son, Zhou Zeyan. He really wanted a daughter. ”
