Just like people like song Chenyu.

“The Cen family didn’t like song Chenyu and were all slandering her. If it was anyone else, they would have long added insult to injury. ”

But song Chenyu didn’t.

“Not only did she not, she even spoke up for the CEN family. ”

“Song Chenyu and Zhou Rui were the same kind of people, the kind of people who didn’t want to fuss. ”

“When she thought of this, Cen Yuyan did not feel so bad. ”

Although God did not give her a good family member.

But God gave her the best lover and best friend.

There was no such thing as having the best of both worlds. She was already very satisfied with how things were now.

“CEN Yuyan continued, “Chenyu, my house has been taken back by my grandmother. I may have to stay at your place for a while.” ”

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “If this were in the past, you can stay as long as you want, but not now.” ”

“Why?”Cen Yuyan asked in confusion.

“Song Chenyu said, “Because you’re just a poor daughter now. Who is willing to give their house to a poor daughter to live in? I can’t get any benefits from you. Do you think I’m doing charity?” ”

“”Chenyu?”All of a sudden, Cen Yuyan felt that this song Chenyu was very unfamiliar. ”

Song Chenyu suddenly laughed softly. “Look at how scared you are. I’m just joking with you!”

Cen Yuyan also laughed. “I’m dumbfounded!”

“”But to be honest, it’s indeed not suitable for you to stay at my place now.”Song Chenyu suddenly straightened his expression. ”

“Why?”Cen Yuyan asked.

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “Because some people will be jealous.” ”

“Cen Yuyan understood the meaning of song Chenyu’s words in a second and said shyly, “He won’t be jealous.” ”

“Song Chenyu said, “You’re already a married man now. If you stay at my place again, what will it look like? Even if I let you stay, Zhou Rui will eat me up!” ”

“Speaking up to this point, song Chenyu continued, “Give me your phone.” ”

“What do you want?”Cen Yuyan asked.

“”To call Zhou Rui.”Song Chenyu smiled and said, “Ask him to come and pick you up.” ”

“Although Cen Yuyan said not to call Zhou Rui, she still handed the phone to Song Chenyu without hesitation. ”

Zhou Rui arrived very quickly.

“In less than half an hour, song Chenyu’s doorbell rang. ”

Song Chenyu bumped into Cen Yuyan’s shoulder. “Look at how nervous your family is about you. They probably left all their work behind.”

Cen Yuyan blushed. “You’re the only one who makes fun of me.”

“I’m telling the truth.”Song Chenyu pulled Cen Yuyan up from the sofa and walked out of the door. “Let’s go quickly. Don’t make Zhou Rui wait so anxiously.”

Cen Yuyan stood up with a half-push.

“The two of them opened the door, and sure enough, Zhou Rui was standing outside. ”

“Song Chenyu pushed Cen Yuyan into Zhou Rui’s arms. “I’ll leave Yuyan to you. Don’t bully her! I still have things to do, so I won’t keep you guys!” ”

“After saying that, he slammed the door shut. ”

“Cen Yuyan stood outside the door and shouted, “Chenyu, thank you.” ”

“Song Chenyu, who was inside the door, curled his lips slightly. ”

A Fool was a fool.

There was simply no hope.

“Outside the door, Zhou Rui looked at Cen Yuyan. “What’s going on? Didn’t I send you back? Did you have a conflict with your family?” ” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“En.”Cen Yuyan nodded.

“Zhou Rui sighed. “Your family didn’t have a good impression of me to begin with. This time, it will definitely be worse.” ”

“After saying that, Zhou Rui continued, “Why don’t I send you back and you apologize to your family?” ”

“”No!”CEN Yuyan said, “This matter was their fault to begin with. What right do they have to make me apologize? Zhou Rui, you don’t understand the cause and effect of this matter at all!” ”

Zhou Rui pulled open the car door. “Then let’s sit in the car and talk about it slowly?”

“En.”

The two of them got into the car and Cen Yuyan began to tell Zhou Rui the whole process.

“Hearing this, Zhou Rui frowned. “How can you make things so awkward with your family?”The awkward situation was secondary. The important thing was that old madam Cen had cut off Cen Yuyan’s source of income. ”

“Without money, how could she live? ”

How could she eat?

“After all, when Zhou Rui and Cen Yuyan were together, it was because Cen Yuyan had money. ”

“Otherwise, who would be willing to serve such an old woman? ”

“Hearing that the CEN family had cut off Cen Yuyan’s source of income, Zhou Rui really panicked. ”

He didn’t know what to do.

“”Zhou Rui, you have to be clear. I’m only making trouble with my family because of you! It’s fine if you don’t comfort me, but how can you still be angry at me!”Cen Yuyan felt extremely wronged. ”
