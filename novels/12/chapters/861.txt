“”It’s just a snake.”Ye Zhuo continued, “Since all of you are so afraid of it, I’ll put it over there.” ”

“Not only was the cauliflower snake not poisonous, but it also ate rats, which was considered a beneficial insect. ”

“”Go, go, Go!”Chang Yu hurriedly nodded. ”

“Yin Wei raised her voice and said, “Zhuo Zhuo, remember to put it further away. Don’t crawl back later.” ”

Ye Zhuo didn’t even look back as he made an ‘OK’gesture. The back view of the snake as it left was extremely cool.

“Looking at Ye Zhuo’s back view, Yin Wei, Wei Xingzhi, and Chang Yu swallowed their throats silently. ”

This little girl was really too fierce!

Liu Xie!

“If it were anyone else, they would have been scared to death. Not only was ye Zhuo not afraid, he even treated the snake as a pet. ”

“By the time ye Zao returned from releasing the snake, all the watermelons had been moved to the tractor. ”

“Ye Zao was a little surprised and said, “You guys are moving too fast!” ”

“”It’s okay. The main thing is that the tractor is in the ground, so it’s easier to move.”After saying that, Chang Yu continued, “Ye, where’s the key to the tractor? We can go home now.” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “The tractor doesn’t have a key.” ”

“It doesn’t have a key?”Chang Yu was very curious. “How can it be started without a key?”

Chang Yu wasn’t the only one who was curious. Wei Xingzhi and Yin Wei were also very curious. They all leaned their heads over.

Ye Zhuo took out a z-shaped handle. “Use this.”

Chang Yu had a face full of question marks. “What’s This?”

“Ye Zhuo explained, “This is a handle. It’s used to start the tractor.” ”

“Before the three of them could react, ye Zao inserted the crank into the engine hole and gently shook it twice. ”

Rumble —

The tractor made a loud noise.

The three of them looked at the tractor in surprise.

“Ye Zao turned to look at everyone. “Teacher Wei, Chang Yu, Wei Wei, the three of you sit at the back. I’ll drive the tractor to take you for a ride!” ”

The three of them immediately climbed onto the tractor.

Ye Zhuo started the tractor.

The Sun was setting in the west. The golden sunlight cast a layer of golden light on the tractor that was driving.

Behind them were Green Mountains and green waters.

“Looking at it this way, it looked like a perfect oil painting that made people gasp in amazement. ”

Yin Wei stood on the tractor and looked ahead. “This is my first time riding a tractor!”

“Chang Yu continued, “It’s also my first time riding on a tractor. What about you, teacher Wei?” ”

“Wei xingzhi smiled and said, “When I was filming a period drama, I sat on a tractor once, but that was three years ago.” ”

“The tractor rumbled along the way, looking extremely cool. ”

The camera of the production team followed them along the way.

“On the way, they bumped into song Chenyu and Lu Qi, who were carrying the watermelons back. ”

It had been more than an hour.

They had only carried a dozen watermelons back.

“Looking at the tractor that drove past him, song Chenyu thought he was seeing things. ”

“Song Chenyu turned to look at Lu Qi and said, “The tractor with the watermelon just now seemed to belong to their Red Team, right?” ”

“Lu Qi immediately questioned the director team, “Why do they have props and we don’t?” ”

Why did the red team have to work so hard to carry the watermelon back when they could use the tractor?

“The director smiled and said, “The red team borrowed the tractor from the villagers in the mountains. If you can borrow it, you can also borrow it! But the prerequisite is that the person driving the tractor must be a member of Your Blue Team! You Can’t ask for help from others!” ”

Lu Qi felt much better when she heard the director say that they could also borrow the tractor.

“Lu Qi turned to look at song Chenyu. “Chenyu, let’s wait for Xuancheng and Yi Wan.” ”

“Lu Qi didn’t know how to drive a tractor, so she could only ask Wang Xuancheng if he knew how to drive. ”

“If Wang Xuancheng knew how to drive a tractor, they wouldn’t have to be so tired. ”

Song Chenyu nodded. “Okay.”

The two of them stood where they were and waited for Wang Xuancheng and song Yiwan.

About five minutes later.

Wang Xuancheng and song Yiwan carried the watermelons over.

The two of them carried a total of five watermelons.

It was about 50 kilograms.

“Wang Xuancheng was still fine, but song Yiwan was so tired that her face was pale. ”

“She usually acted in both films and also participated in a few variety shows, but she wasn’t this tired. ” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“If it were not for the good viewership ratings of ‘village’, Song Yiwan would have fallen out with them long ago. ”

“”Xuancheng, Yiwan.”Song Chenyu waved at the two of them. ”

“The two of them immediately stopped in their tracks. “Chenyu, Lu Qi, what’s the matter?” ”

“Lu Qi asked, “Xuancheng, do you know how to drive a tractor?”? “There’s a tractor in the village. The director said that we can borrow a tractor from them, but the prerequisite is that the person driving the tractor must be us. With a tractor, we won’t have to be so tired.” ”

“Wang Xuancheng shook his head. “Although I don’t know how to drive a tractor, I know how to drive!” ”

The light in Lu Qi’s eyes completely disappeared at this moment. “Of course! I know how to drive too!”But so what if he knew how to drive? He had to know how to drive a tractor here!

“Lu Qi and Wang Xuancheng didn’t know how to drive a tractor, let alone song Chenyu and song Yiwan. ”

The four of them had no choice but to give up on the plan to drive the tractor and carry the watermelon back.

“Wang Xuancheng asked curiously, “Who is the person on the Red Team who knows how to drive a tractor?” ”

“Song yiwan continued, “Among them, teacher Wei is the most experienced. He should be teacher Wei, right?” ”

Lu Qi and song Chenyu only saw the members of the red team return in the tractor. They did not see who was driving the tractor at all.

But it should be Wei Xingzhi.

“After all, Wei Xingzhi’s age was obvious. ”

Who could drive a tractor nowadays?

“Even song Chenyu, who had extensive knowledge, couldn’t. ”

Not to mention ye Zhuo and Yin Wei.

In the small courtyard.

Ye Zhuo directly started the tractor and poured out the watermelon from the bucket. The other three moved the watermelon to the side.

“In less than ten minutes, the watermelon was neatly piled in the corner of the courtyard. ”

“After the director team weighed them, there was a total of 1,000 catties. According to the price of 10 yuan per 50 catties, 1,000 catties was 200 yuan. ”

The director team personally handed the money to Wei Xingzhi.

“Looking at the hard-earned 200 Yuan, Wei Xingzhi was full of emotion and said, “Let’s exchange it for 20 yuan of chicken feed first.”After saying that, Wei Xingzhi turned to look at the other three, “Yezi, Wei Wei, Chang Yu, what do you guys want to eat tonight? We can ask the director team to exchange it.” ”

“Yin Wei thought for a moment and said, “I want to eat boiled meat.” ”

“Chang Yu said, “I want to eat braised fish.” ”

“Ye Zhuo looked at Wei xingzhi and said, “Teacher Wei, I want some flour, glutinous rice flour, and a bag of sugar.”She had a habit of eating desserts after meals. Now that she had come to the program team, she could only rely on herself, she could only rely on herself. ”

“Wei Xingzhi nodded and turned to look at the director team. “If it’s fish, we can go to the fish pond to catch it ourselves. Then we’ll need a catty of streaky pork, a bag of flour, a bag of glutinous rice flour, a bag of sugar, and a bag of baking powder.” ”

“The director noted down these things and continued, “In thirty minutes, we’ll get someone to buy these things and send them over. It’s a total of 100 yuan.” ”

“”That expensive?”Wei xingzhi continued, “Can it be cheaper? Look at the four of us, we’ve been working hard all afternoon!” ”

“No!”The director shook his head.

The others also started to bargain with the director.

“However, the director was not cheap at all. ”

Wei Xingzhi endured the pain and handed the director a 100 yuan bill.

“After exchanging the ingredients and feeding the chicken, Chang Yu took fishing tools from the warehouse. “Then let’s Go Fishing First!” ”

“Sure!”

“Is this a fishing net?”Yin Wei asked curiously.

“Chang Yu explained with a smile, “This is an earth cage, and this is a fishing net.” ”

Yin Wei nodded.

The four of them walked towards the fish pond in a majestic manner.

“The fish pond was very large, covering an area of three Mu. ”

“The water was relatively clear, and there were even lotus flowers growing inside. At this time, it was the time when the lotus flowers were in full bloom. A gentle breeze blew over, bringing with it the fragrance of the flowers. Looking over, one would immediately feel relaxed and happy, and one could not help but think of that poem. ”

“The sky-reaching lotus leaves were boundless green, and the lotus flowers reflected the Sun were exceptionally red. ”

“This place is so beautiful!”Yin Wei exclaimed.

“Ye Zao nodded. “The Willows on the shore dye the green streams, and the fragrance of the lotus infuses the golden autumn. It is indeed very beautiful.”Before coming to this world, ye Zao had originally thought that the scene described in this poem did not exist at all. ”

“After coming, he realized that all the beautiful scenes he had read in the poem could be seen in real life. ”

“Hearing this, Wei Xingzhi raised his head and looked at ye Zao. ”

He had thought that ye Zao only had great strength and knew how to catch snakes.

He did not expect that this person was also very talented.

“These two lines were not as well-known as ‘sky-connecting lotus leaf Wuqiong Bi, Sun reflecting Lotus Flower Bie Yanhong’. If it was not for his extensive reading, he would not have been able to remember them. ”

This meant that ye Zao was not as simple as she looked.

Her ability might have exceeded everyone’s imagination.

“Yin Wei took out her phone. “Teacher Wei, Ye Zi, Chang Yu, shall I take a picture of the three of you?” ”
