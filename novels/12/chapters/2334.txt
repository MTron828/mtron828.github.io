“Okay.”Lin Ze nodded.

Bai Jingshu was preparing tea and snacks in the back room because Lin Ze had informed her last night that Ye Han and Shi Qingcheng would be coming with them today.

“In front of elder Bai, Lin Ze was too embarrassed to call for help directly. Ye Han could see the awkwardness between the two of them and broke the silence with a smile. “Sister Jingshu.” ”

Bai Jingshu raised her head slightly. “You’re here! Where’s Qingcheng? Why didn’t she come with you?”

“Ye Han said, “She was delayed by something. She’ll be here soon.” ”

“”Oh, I see.”Bai Jingshu nodded. “Take a seat first and have some tea.” ”

Lin Ze walked over to Bai Jingshu’s side and took the Teacup from her hand. “Let me do it.”

“This small detail caught elder Bai’s eye, and he felt even more certain that he had not misjudged Lin Ze. Lin Ze was a good child and a person worthy of being entrusted with his life. ”

“After sitting down, elder Bai looked at Lin Ze and continued, “Xiao Lin, does your family know about your relationship with Jingshu?” ”

“”Grandpa,”Lin Ze looked up at elder Bai, “I’ve already brought Jingshu back to visit her parents. They’re very satisfied with her.” ”

“”That’s good.”Elder Bai nodded with a smile. “I don’t want to brag, but this granddaughter of mine hasn’t had any other good qualities since she was young. She’s just very likable and she’s not too good-looking.” ”

To say that her looks were just so-so was definitely self-deprecating. Bai Jingshu had been the school’s most beautiful goddess since she was young.

“Otherwise, she wouldn’t have been pursued by so many people. ” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“”Jingshu is very outstanding. You’re too modest,”Lin ze said. ”

“Elder Bai took a sip of tea and continued, “Xiao Lin, how many people are there in your family? How many parents and brothers are there?” ”

“Although he had long understood Lin Ze’s family background, he still had to go through the necessary formalities. ”

“”I have a younger sister, my father has four older brothers, and my mother is an only child. My grandparents have already left, and only my grandmother is still alive.” ”

Lin Ze answered in detail.

“Elder Bai nodded. “Then, your father is the fifth son at Home?” ”

“Yes.”Lin Ze nodded.

“Elder Bai had a total of three sons. Unfortunately, these three sons were not great generals and could only be blessed by their ancestors. Otherwise, the three of them could only be ordinary civilians. ”

“In the early years, the three brothers fought each other for the inheritance. It was comparable to a palace war blockbuster. On average, they could put on a big show every three days. ”

“But now, it was much better. ”

“Therefore, elder Bai had never liked families with many brothers and sisters. ”

There were many things that troubled brothers.

Especially when Lin Ze’s father actually had five brothers.

“After a while, elder Bai continued to ask, “Then, how are the uncles of your father’s generation getting along with each other?” ”

“Although Old Master Bai admired Lin Ze, he did not want Bai Jingshu to be embroiled in intrigue the moment she married into the Lin family. ”

Bai Jingshu had been innocent since she was young and could not handle such intrigue.

“Hearing this, Bai Jingshu smiled and raised her head to answer this question for Lin Ze. “Grandfather, the uncles in his family are all very nice. I went to his house on the mid-autumn Festival and met a few uncles and aunts.” ”

“It wasn’t just the mid-autumn Festival. When Old Lady Lin passed away, Bai Jingshu had interacted with the Lin family’s relatives. ”

“The Lin family was very amiable. Whether it was the elders, peers, or the younger generation, they all treated her very well. ”

“Is that so?”Old Master Bai raised his head to look at Bai Jingshu.

“Bai Jingshu nodded. “Yes. If you don’t believe me, you can ask Ye Han.” ”

“Ye Han immediately nodded, “It’s like this, grandfather. Don’t worry. My uncles are all very kind. Although they’re not usually in the capital, when the time comes, or if they run into any big issues, they’ll gather together!” ”

“Ye Han also said whatever he wanted to say. He had been an orphan since he was young. If it weren’t for ye Zhuo bringing him back, he wouldn’t even have a proper home. Therefore, he was very envious of the Lin family’s way of getting along. ”

“Hearing this, elder Bai narrowed his eyes. So, this meant that not only were the brothers of the Lin family not scheming against each other, they were actually very harmonious? ”

This was really strange!

“At this time, Lin ze said, “Grandfather, don’t worry. I definitely won’t mistreat Jingshu. If you don’t believe me, you can come to my house anytime to investigate.” ”

“Elder Bai chuckled, “Xiao Lin, look at what you’re saying. I’m just asking casually. As you know, Jingshu is my favorite granddaughter. As for me, I want her to marry into a good family. I don’t want her to be mistreated.” ”
