Upstairs.

Cen Shaoqing was listening to the calming Buddhist music while cutting the window flowers. There was a pile of red paper on the table that had been cut. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“After cutting for a long time, CEN Shaoqing did not succeed. Instead, he managed to leave two wounds on his fingers. Blood dripped on the red paper, but it was not obvious.”

“Although he cut the red paper, CEN Shaoqing still did not give up.”

On the other side.

“After Cen Yuyan went upstairs, she dialed song Chenyu’s video.”

“”Chenyu, I’m sorry.”Cen Yuyan said with a face full of guilt, “I couldn’t convince my grandmother.””

“This result was within song Chenyu’s expectations. Ever since she went to the Cen family, song Chenyu knew that old Madam Cen was not very satisfied with her.”

“After all, Ye Zhuo was the granddaughter-in-law that old Mrs. Cen had personally chosen.”

It was only natural that old Mrs. Cen would favor ye Zhuo a little.

“However, song Chenyu would not be discouraged by this.”

Life was full of challenges.

To conquer Old Mrs. Cen and win her recognition was song Chenyu’s current task.

No one had ever disliked song Chenyu in his entire life.

Which of the country-level veteran actors that had worked with her had not praised her endlessly?

Old Madam Cen and those veteran actors were difficult to deal with?

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “What’s there to be sorry about? The New Year is a day for family reunion. As an outsider, it’s indeed inappropriate for me to go to Your House for the New Year. Don’t be angry with your grandmother.””

“CEN Yuyan continued, “My mother was about to agree, but my grandmother was the only one who firmly refused. I was almost angered to death by her! I even suspect that my grandmother has Alzheimer’s Now!””

Song Chenyu had always known that Zhou Xiang had a good impression of her.

“If ye Zhuo had not interfered, perhaps Zhou Xiang would have already introduced her to Cen Shaoqing.”

“Unfortunately, there were no ifs in this world.”

“Song Chenyu’s heart spun a thousand times, but the smile on his face remained. He continued, “Don’t be angry. Your grandmother did the right thing. Yuyan, you must have been angry with your grandmother just now, right?””

Cen Yuyan did not speak.

“Song Chenyu continued, “Yuyan, we are best friends. I don’t want you to have conflicts with your family because of me, especially your grandmother. Grandmother is already so old. Today is the New Year, and she is already old. Who knows how many days she will have like this in the future. I hope you can go and apologize to her.””

Cen Yuyan sighed in her heart.

“Old Mrs. Cen had slandered song Chenyu, but Song Chenyu was so magnanimous and even advised her to apologize to old Mrs. Cen. If it were anyone else, how could they be as magnanimous as song Chenyu?”

Yet old Mrs. Cen did not appreciate her kindness at all.

“Seeing that Cen Yuyan had not spoken, song chenyu continued, “Yuyan, are you listening?””

“Cen Yuyan finally reacted, “Chenyu, do you know what my grandmother said about you just now?””

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “The old lady has a mouth but doesn’t mean it. Don’t be calculative. Hurry up and apologize to grandmother.””

“”Alright, if you’re not calculative, why should I be calculative with her?”Cen Yuyan continued, “I’ll go in a while.””

“After chatting with song Chenyu, Cen Yuyan adjusted her mood and went downstairs to apologize to old Madam Cen.”

“”Grandma, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have used that attitude to talk to you just now. Please forgive me.””

“Old Madam Cen glanced at her. “Since today is the New Year, I won’t bother with you! Go upstairs.””

“Cen Yuyan wanted to say something, but she swallowed her words and turned around to go upstairs.”

“Looking at Cen Yuyan’s back, Zhou Xiang whispered to old Mrs. Cen, “Mom, do you think the fourth girl has grown up? She even knows to take the initiative to apologize!”The CEN Yuyan in the past would not be like this.”

“Old Mrs. Cen said, “It’s most likely that the fish gave it to me.””

“What?”Zhou Xiang was a little surprised.

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Don’t you understand? That fish wants to use this imbecile to gain a good impression of me! Do you really think I’m that old fool of the Lin Family? Playing this trick in front of me! She’s still young!””

“Zhou Xiang said with some doubt, “Are you so sure that the fish gave it to her?””

“”As a grandmother, don’t I know what kind of person my granddaughter is?”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “To put it bluntly, I already know what kind of SH * t she is going to take before she even raises her buttocks!””

“Old Mrs. Cen’s words were rough but not harsh. Thinking about it carefully, it was indeed reasonable!”

“After she finished speaking, Old Mrs. Cen instructed Zhou Xiang again, “Xiang Xiang, you are a good child in every way, but you are a little bit stupid. Let me tell you, don’t be deceived by that fish! Our Cen family’s granddaughter-in-law can only be Yezi!””
