“Chapter 1691: 352: high energy ahead, Big Brother Ye is on-line abusing dregs! 2”

Translator: 549690339

Lin Sha was in a coma due to sudden food poisoning.

“After the room manager called 120, he said, “Miss Lin, 120 said they will send a car over as soon as possible!””

Ye Zhuo frowned slightly. “I can’t wait for 120 to come over! Do you have a first-aid medical kit in Your Hotel?”

“Yes!”The manager nodded.

“Get Someone to bring it over immediately.”

“Okay.”

“The next second, Ye Zao picked Lin Sha up from the ground and put her on the bed.”

The manager was a little surprised to see her like this.

Lin Sha was at least 90 to 100 pounds. How could this little girl pick her up so easily.

The next scene surprised the manager even more.

Ye Zhuo took out the acupuncture bag and directly stabbed a silver needle into Lin Shasha’s forehead. His white fingertips twirled the silver needle and slowly rotated it.

“The manager said in surprise, “Miss Ye, what are you doing!””

“”Acupuncture,”ye Zhuo said calmly.”

Acupuncture!

Ye Zhuo looked like he was only seventeen or eighteen years old. Did she know acupuncture?

“The manager quickly took out his phone to take a video. “Then let’s make it clear in advance. Your personal acupuncture has nothing to do with our hotel. If anything happens to Miss Lin, you and your family can not blame our hotel!””

“”Don’t worry.”Ye Zhuo took out the second silver needle and said faintly, “If anything happens, I will bear the responsibility alone.””

“The manager continued, “I can take out my phone to take video evidence now. You Can’t go back on your words.””

“Okay.”

“In the blink of an eye, a few silver needles had been inserted into Lin Sha’s acupuncture points.”

“At the same time, the hotel staff brought the first-aid kit over.”

“Ye Zao continued, “Pass me the disinfectant alcohol.””

The manager passed the phone to the staff. “Continue recording.”

“Okay.”

The manager took out the disinfectant alcohol from the box and passed it to Ye Zhuo.

“Then, Ye Zhuo took out a black pill and was about to feed it to Lin Sha.”

“The manager was a little worried, “Is this a product without product? What if something goes wrong with it?””

“”I told you, if something goes wrong with it, I will take care of all the problems.”Ye Zhuo pinched Lin Sha’s mouth and fed the pill.”

The pill was made by Ye Zao. It could cure all kinds of poisons and melt in the mouth.

“A few seconds later, Lin Sha frowned. The next second, she opened her eyes.”

“The manager said in surprise, “You’re awake! Miss Lin is awake!””

“... Zao?”Lin Sha only felt a headache and her throat was burning.

“”Sister Sha Sha, don’t talk. Drink some water first.”Ye Zao helped Lin Sha sit up from the bed.”

The manager passed a glass of water to ye Zao.

Ye Zao passed the Glass of water to Lin Shasha’s mouth.

“As the water entered her throat, the burning sensation in her throat immediately lessened, as if it had been a long drought.”

“After a while, Lin Shasha said slowly, “Zao Zao, what happened to me?””

“”Food poisoning,”ye Zao said, “Think about it. Did you eat anything else besides lunch in the restaurant?””

“”No.”Lin Sha shook her head, “After lunch, I went to sleep. When I woke up, I was like this.””

“After saying that, Lin Sha seemed to have thought of something and said with a pale face, “Exam! Is it time for the exam? Did I miss the exam?””

“Lin Sha had missed the exam last year because of her appendix. If she missed the exam again this year, she would have no hope at all!”

“”There’s still half an hour before the exam. You should rest for ten minutes first. I’ll send you to the exam room later,”ye Zhuo said.”

“Hearing that she had not missed the exam, Lin Sha was relieved. “It’s good that you didn’t miss the exam!””

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Sister Sha Sha, think carefully now. After I left, did you and Zou Feifei really not eat anything else?””

“”No.”Lin Shasha shook her head. “By the way, where’s Zou Feifei? Is she okay?””

“She’s fine. I couldn’t get through to you on the phone just now. She even planned to come in with the housekeeping manager to see how you were doing.”

“Lin Shasha asked curiously, “You said that I had food poisoning, but we ate the same thing. Why are you fine and Zou Feifei is fine too?””

“”If that’s what I’m curious about,”ye Zao said.”

“At that moment, an ambulance arrived.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“The doctor examined Lin Sha. “So far, nothing seems to be wrong, but I still suggest that you all be admitted for observation.””

“”I still have the college entrance exam in the afternoon,”Lin Sha said”
