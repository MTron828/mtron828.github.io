Translator: 549690339

“Mike was a little speechless as he said, “It really isn’t...””

“Ten million!”

“Thirty million!”

“”Mike, please have mercy on a pitiful person like me! Yesen is my only son in this world. He can’t die, he can’t Die!””

“If Yesen died, who would the Zhao family rely on to pass on their legacy?”

“As long as he could save Yesen, he was willing to do anything for Father Zhao!”

Even if it cost his life!

“”Mr. Zhao,”Mike’s voice was a little helpless, “You’ve already bid 30 million. If I really have the antidote, would I not sell it to you? I really don’t have the antidote...””

“Father Zhao leaned against the wall and fell to the ground weakly, his face ashen.”

“Ah!”

Father Zhao used his hands to hammer the wall and burst into tears.

“Perhaps it was because the sound was too loud, there was a knock on the door. “Master, Are You Alright?””

“Master?”

Father Zhao was immersed in his own world and did not hear the Butler’s voice.

“The Butler was afraid that something would happen to Father Zhao, so he pushed the door open and entered.”

“The moment he entered, he saw Father Zhao lying weakly on the ground.”

The Butler was shocked and quickly ran over to help father Zhao up. “Master!”

“Old Zhang!”Father Zhao hugged the butler and cried out loud.

“”Master, What’s Wrong?”The Butler continued to ask.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“”I found a Ye, I found a Ye!””

“”That’s a good thing! Why are you crying!”The butler continued, “If people who don’t know know know know about this, they will think that something big has happened!””

“You don’t understand! You Don’t understand!”Father Zhao took a deep breath. “Prepare the car! Quickly prepare the car for me! I want to go to the first People’s Hospital in the city!”

“It was already past two in the morning. The butler said, “It’s already so late. Do you still want to go to the hospital?””

“I told you to prepare the car!”

“”Okay, I’ll go now!””

The Butler turned around and went to prepare the car.

“Soon, the car was ready.”

The butler and the driver sat in the front seat while Father Zhao sat alone in the back seat.

“Drive faster! Drive Faster!”

“The driver said with some difficulty, “Master, this is already...””

“At this moment, the butler tugged at the driver’s sleeve. The driver quickly changed his words, “Yes, master, I’m already speeding up!””

Father Zhao looked out of the car window anxiously.

Buddha bless!

Buddha bless!

He must bless Yesen well.

He must not get into any trouble!

“Father Zhao sat in the back seat and muttered to himself, “Buddha, Oh Buddha, as long as you can bless a ye to be fine, I’m willing to lose thirty years of My Life! Fifty Years!””

The Butler in the front seat twitched the corner of his mouth.

Lose Thirty Years of his life?

Father Zhao was already more than seventy years old this year. could he still live to be more than a hundred years old?

There weren’t many cars on the road at night.

“About 30 minutes later, the car arrived at the entrance of the hospital.”

“Before the car stopped, Father Zhao couldn’t wait to open the car door and get out. His footsteps were hurried, and several times, he almost fell on the road.”

The Butler followed behind. “Master! Wait for me!”

Father Zhao acted as if he didn’t hear the Butler’s voice. He ran all the way into the hospital hall and came to the information desk. “Where is my son? How is my son now?”

“The nurse on duty was still dozing off. When she saw Father Zhao like this, she was shocked. “Sir, don’t be anxious. Let’s talk slowly. May I know your son’s name?””

“Zhao Ziye!”Father Zhao blurted out.

“”Okay, please wait a moment.”The nurse began to search for the patient’s information.”

“A moment later, the nurse looked up at Father Zhao and said, “Sir, there is no patient named Zhao Ziye in our hospital!””

“No? How is that possible! How is it possible that there is no patient!”Father Zhao’s anger was ignited at this moment. “Are you a nurse or not? My Son is in this hospital! What have you done to my son?”

“The nurse was a little helpless and continued, “Old sir, let’s check. May I ask if it is the night of Little Zhao, the son of his children and grandchildren?””

“Yes!”Father Zhao nodded.

“The nurse lowered her head and looked at the computer screen again. “I’m sorry, but we really don’t have a patient named Zhao Ziye Here!””

“At this moment, Father Zhao seemed to have thought of something and continued, “Yesen! Leaf’s leaf, forest’s forest.””

“As he said this, Father Zhao recalled the scene of Yesen introducing himself when they first met.”

His A Ye was such a polite person.

“Thinking of this, Zhao’s father was filled with regret.”

Muddle-headed.

He was really too muddle-headed.

“Not only was he muddle-headed, he was also the world’s most unqualified father!”
