Even though ye Zhuo had temporarily brought benefits to the consortium.

But those were all temporary.

Could Ye Zhuo still rely on a man for his entire life?

“Hearing that, Zhao Xueyin hurriedly shook her head, “No! I don’t want to! Shunxi consortium is my father’s life’s work. I Can’t let it go to ruin!”” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“”Then listen to me! Don’t admit defeat! Once you lose, the Shunxi Financial Group will really be finished!””

“Zhao xueyin nodded very firmly, “En, Big Brother Si, I’ll listen to you.””

“Si lui smiled and said, “It’s good that you can think it through.””

He was just afraid that Zhao Xueyin wouldn’t be able to get over this hurdle.

“Then I’ll send you back now?”Si lui asked.

“Okay.”Zhao Xueyin nodded.

The lawyer drove away.

“The car was very fast. Half an hour later, the car stopped in front of the Zhao family’s villa.”

“The lawyer opened the door and got out of the car. Out of habit, he reached out his hand to Zhao Xueyin.”

Zhao Xueyin put her hand on the lawyer’s hand.

The lawyer held Zhao Xueyin’s hand and got out of the car.

“Seeing the two of them come in together, Father Zhao’s originally gloomy face revealed a smile. “Ah Lui is here.””

“Uncle.”

“Father Zhao asked the maid to make tea for Si Lui, then looked up at Zhao Xueyin. “Have you invited Qian Zhu?””

“Hearing the word Qian Zhu, Zhao Xueyin’s expression darkened.”

“Have you not invited her?”Father Zhao continued to ask.

Zhao Xueyin nodded. “Yes.”

“Si lui quickly explained for Zhao Xueyin, “Uncle, this is not Xue Yin’s fault. Qian Zhu and Ye Zhuo are in an improper relationship, so...””

The lawyer did not feel that there was anything wrong with this sentence.

Ye Zao had a boyfriend and was still fooling around outside. This was an improper relationship between a man and a woman.

It was also because society was different now.

“In the past, this kind of behavior would have been drowned in a pig cage!”

Ye Zao?

Why was it ye Zao again.

How many times had it been?

Father Zhao could not even remember how many times Zhao Xueyin had fallen at the hands of ye Zao!

“Every time she met ye Zao, Zhao Xueyin would change from a winning general to a defeated general.”

Ye Zao was like Zhao Xueyin’s nemesis!

“They were both girls, why was Zhao Xueyin inferior to ye Zao?”

“If ye Zao was a man, then forget it!”

Father Zhao was completely convinced that Zhao Xueyin had lost to a man!

But now.

Zhao Xueyin had actually lost to a little girl!

“Moreover, it was a little girl who was younger than Zhao Xueyin and had a lower education level than Zhao Xueyin.”

How could father Zhao Swallow this down?

“Father Zhao frowned and raised his head to look at Zhao Xueyin. With a cold face, he said, “I don’t understand! Does this ye Zhuo have three heads and six arms? Why do you always lose to her?””

“”Father, I’m sorry...””

“Father Zhao pinched his temples. After a moment, he let out a long sigh. “Forget it, forget it! It’s your fault for not being a man!””

“If Zhao Xueyin was a man, she definitely wouldn’t have lost so badly.”

“Hearing this, Zhao Xueyin felt very uncomfortable.”

“Could it be that just because she was a man, she could change the situation?”

She desperately wanted to prove in front of Father Zhao that she was not inferior to any other boy.

But she lost to Ye Zhuo.

She was unwilling.

Zhao Xueyin was truly unwilling.

She was waiting.

“One day, she would make ye Zhuo lose to her!”

She would let Father Zhao know.

She was not inferior to anyone.

“”Master! Master!”At this moment, the butler rushed in from outside.”

“What’s Wrong?”Father Zhao raised his head.

The butler glanced at si lui but did not say anything.

“Si Lui was a smart man and immediately said, “Uncle, I suddenly remembered that I have something to do, so I won’t Bother You Anymore!””

“Speaking up to this point, Si lui paused and then said, “Don’t blame Xue Yin for what happened to Qian You.””

“Yes.”Father Zhao nodded with a smile. “I was just saying. When have I ever really blamed her?”

“Hearing this, Si lui was slightly relieved and turned to walk out of the door.”

“Seeing si lui’s figure disappear outside the door, Father Zhao turned to look at the butler, “What’s Wrong?””

“The Butler looked a little excited, “Master, Master Five, Master Five’s assistant is here!””

“Father Zhao was a little incredulous, “Who did you say is here?””

“Master Five’s assistant!”The Butler repeated.

“Zhao Xueyin’s eyes lit up and quickly reacted, “You mean Master Five’s assistant? Master five of DK Financial Group?””

“Yes!”The Butler quickly nodded.

“Father Zhao also reacted at this time, “Then why don’t you quickly invite him in!””

That was Master Five’s assistant!

Master five of DK Financial Group.

Father Zhao was very excited now.

“It seemed that Zhao Xueyin was right, master five had indeed taken a fancy to her.”

“Otherwise, his assistant wouldn’t have suddenly come to the Zhao family.”
