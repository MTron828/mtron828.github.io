Chapter 82: 073: Going to the capital, the anniversary party! 3

Yesen repeated what he had just said.

This time, Yesen did not complain that Yesen was too long-winded.

They got on the plane.

Lin Sha smiled and said, “Zaozao, I didn’t realize before that uncle was so cute.”

“Didn’t he treat Mu Yourong like this in the past?”Yesen asked.

“No.”Lin Sha shook her head,

in the past, Mu Yourong despised ye Sen for being just a delivery man. She did not even want to talk to him. She even liked to ridicule him. She did not treat ye Sen as an elder at all.

Liking each other was mutual.

Since Mu Yourong despised ye Sen so much, Ye Sen naturally did not like Mu Yourong.

Therefore, Lin Sha had always thought that ye Sen was a very serious person.

She didn’t expect Yesen to be so cute.

It took four hours to fly from Yunjing to the capital city.

So, after the plane took off, Yesen put on an eye mask and began to take a nap.

Last night, the live broadcast lasted until three o’clock in the morning, which was a good time to catch up on sleep.

Just then, a piercing cry of a baby was heard in the air.

“Wah, wah, Wah...”

All the passengers on the plane were startled awake and looked towards the source of the sound.

It was a young couple. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The husband was holding the child and coaxing him.

The wife said with a red face, “I’m sorry everyone, the child choked when he was eating just now. I’m sorry, I’m Sorry Love.”

At this moment, the child’s crying stopped abruptly.

The husband said, “Shuxiang, quick, look, what’s wrong with the baby! Why is her face so Green!”

Chu Shuxiang looked down and was so shocked that her face turned pale. Her sobbing voice sounded, “Baby, Baby, are you okay?”

The child’s face was black and blue, and her lips were tightly shut. She looked as if she was about to die.

“Quickly give the child to me.”At this moment, a light voice appeared in the air.

Chu Shuxiang looked up and saw that the other party was a young girl around the age of seventeen or eighteen.

She was very beautiful.

It was the most suitable description to describe her as devastatingly beautiful.

It was just that she was a little young.

“You, what do you want to Do?”Chu Shuxiang looked at ye Zao with a guarded expression.

Ye Zao smiled faintly. “I know the Qi Huang technique. Quickly give the child to me, or else she will lose her life.”

Hearing this, not only were the young couple stunned.

Even the other passengers on the plane were stunned.

Such a young girl actually said that she knew Chinese medicine.

Wasn’t this a joke?

Chinese medicine was the quintessence of the nation left behind by the ancestors, and there were many mysteries in it. Normal people had to study for more than ten to twenty years before they could master it, so since ancient times, Chinese medicine had always been the elderly.

How many young people dared to say that they knew Chinese medicine.

Therefore, Ye Zao’s words were no different from a joke.

The young couple did not dare to trust ye Zao either.

At this moment, the child’s face turned from green to white at a speed visible to the naked eye. His body was also soft. The husband immediately cried out. He did not think too much and quickly handed the child to ye Zao.

“I beg you to save my baby!”

“Jianbang! You’re Crazy!”Chu Shuxiang looked at Zhou Jianbang in disbelief.

Then, she snatched the child back from ye Zhuo’s hands. “Give the child back to me!”

Zhou Jianbang hugged Chu Shuxiang. “Shuxiang, don’t be so agitated. Let this young lady try!”

The child was already on the verge of death!

Under such circumstances, she could only try her best.

It was better than watching the child die!

Chu Shuxiang struggled with all her might. “Zhou Jianbang, let go of me! She will cause the death of our baby!”

As a mother, Chu Shuxiang could not bear to see Zhou Jianbang hand over his own flesh and blood to a little girl who was not even an adult yet.

Zhou Jianbang looked at Ye Zhuo. “Little girl, Please!”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and carried the child. He half-squatted down and pinned the child on his knees.

Ye Zhuo first pressed a few major acupoints on the child’s body and then gently patted the child’s back.

After a series of movements, the child did not improve at all. Instead, it became more serious.

Lying on Ye Zao’s knees, he did not move at all, as if he had already died.

Seeing This!

The passengers on the plane all sucked in a breath of cold air.

The little girl was really too daring!

This was a human life!

“I knew that this little girl definitely did not know Chinese medicine!”

“This is too ridiculous!”

“I wonder how this little girl’s parents taught her! She really doesn’t know what’s good for her!”

“Poor little baby, she’s not even two years old yet...”

Listening to the voices of the crowd, Chu Shuxiang had already lost control.
