Chapter 71: Where’s My Mother?

Feng Qianhua patted Nanny Zhang’s hand. “The weather has been bad recently. It’s been cloudy and rainy. Your joints aren’t good. Remember to take care of yourself.”

“Alright.” Nanny Zhang nodded.

Both of their expressions were hidden under the heavy shadows.

Everything was said without saying.

Nanny Zhang did not reject Feng Qianhua’s gift anymore. She said, “It’s getting late. Drive carefully on the road.”

Feng Qianhua nodded.

Nanny Zhang did not leave immediately after Feng Qianhua left. Instead, she stood where she was and watched as the taillights of the car completely disappeared into the night. Then, she turned around and walked into the manor.

…

After Lin Shasha left, Ye Zhuo stayed at home to study the chip. She hoped that the temperature-adjustable clothes could be released on the market as soon as possible.

Then, she log into the international website to take on a few missions.

Because she was busy, Ye Zhuo didn’t go to the restaurant to help out in the evening.

The next morning, Ye Zhuo and Zhao Pingting were returning after a run. They had just reached the gate of the community, when suddenly, an extended version of a Lincoln came across her.

As the car door opened, six men in uniform stepped out of the car one by one and stood side by side in a row.

All of them were in black clothes and sunglasses.

It was very similar to the scene of the rich young ladies on TV.

It was so cool!

Then, an old lady with white hair walked out from inside like a star.

Seeing who it was, Ye Zhuo was stunned. “Granny Cen?”

Used to Granny Cen’s shabby clothes, Ye Zhuo was taken aback when she saw the old lady dressed so elegantly.

“Ye Zi!”

Madam Cen rushed over quickly and gave Ye Zhuo a big hug.

After not seeing her for so many days, her granddaughter-in-law was still as beautiful as ever!

Ye Zi was even more beautiful than her when she was young!

Madam Cen continued, “Ye Zi, did you get a shock just now? Did you think that you saw the wrong person?”

Ye Zhuo nodded. “A little.”

Madam Cen said with a proud face, “I already told you that my family owns a mine, but you still didn’t believe me!”

Ye Zhuo said, “Yes, I believe you now.”

This bodyguard, this ostentation, this small luxury car… the old lady’s family didn’t just have a mine.

Ye Zhuo would even have believed her if she said that her family had a banknote printing machine that specialized in producing banknotes.

Madam Cen continued, “My eldest grandson is really a handsome man and is loved by everyone!”

As she said this, Madam Cen winked at Ye Zhuo. “How about it? Do you want to consider my eldest grandson?”

It was said that an elderly person was like treasure.

This was not wrong at all.

Madam Cen was acting like a child.

Ye Zhuo subtly changed the topic. “Granny Cen, it’s so hot outside. Let’s quickly enter the house and talk! Before my mother went to the restaurant this morning, she specially made iced sour plum soup. It’s really delicious.”

“Alright.” Madam Cen nodded. She turned around and said to the five bodyguards, “Bring your weapons and follow me!”

Bring weapons?

Ye Zhuo was stunned.

Was Madam Cen going to fight?

Madam Cen smiled and explained, “Ye Zi, you were so nice to me before. You treated me to crayfish and coke, so I brought some gifts for your mother and your uncle.”

“Granny Cen, you’re too polite. I’ll welcome you as a guest anytime, but you really don’t have to spend money to buy anything.”

Madam Cen patted Ye Zhuo’s hand. “My house has mines! All these are nothing to me! Furthermore, I’ve only brought just a little over. Oh, right, Ye Zi, I also brought some Tibetan fragrant pig. Let’s walk a little faster. I heard that Tibetan fragrant pig is really delicious!”

Madam Cen had come to the Ye family residence once, so she was pretty familiar with the layout of the house.

As soon as they entered the Ye family residence, she began to instruct the bodyguards to arrange the gifts she had brought.

Ye Zhuo went to the kitchen to make tea for Madam Cen.

When she came out of the kitchen after making the tea, she was surprised to find that half of the living room was almost occupied by the gifts.

“Granny Cen, why did you bring so many things here?” What happened to just a little?

Madam Cen was stunned at first, then she said, “You mean all these? This is too much? Ye Zi, are you kidding me?” If not for the car being too small and could not fit more, she had intended to buy even more things for Ye Zhuo!

Ye Zhuo handed the teacup to Madam Cen and continued, “Granny Cen, you are not allowed to bring anything over when you come to visit me here in the future! Otherwise, I will be angry.”

Madam Cen took the teacup, looked around the house, and began to change the topic, “Right, Ye Zi, where is your mother?”

“Promise me first, then I will tell you.”

Back when she first met the old lady, Ye Zhuo had extended her hand to help the old lady, thinking that the old lady was a pitiful homeless. She did not expect anything in return.

Now that the old lady had brought so many gifts over, Ye Zhuo truly felt a lot of pressure.

Madam Cen muttered, “Ye Zi, why are you still treating me like an outsider?”

Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “It’s precisely because I don’t treat you like an outsider that I don’t allow you to bring anything over.”

Madam Cen rolled her eyes. “Then you have to come to my house for a visit when you have time!”

“Alright!” Ye Zhuo nodded.

“Pinky swear!” Madam Cen stuck out her little finger at Ye Zhuo. “The pinky swear will not change for a hundred years. Whoever goes against it will become a little flower dog!”

…

On the other side.

Beijing.

Madam Lin called Lin Ze into her room.

“Grandma, what did you want to see me about?”

Madam Lin glanced at Lin Ze and considered her words carefully before continuing, “Ah Ze, do you want your father to find you another mother?”

The response to Madam Lin was silence in the air.

There was no expression on Lin Ze’s face.

He was not surprised.

He was not angry.

He was not furious.

He was so calm that Madam Lin could not figure out what he was thinking.

Just as Madam Lin was about to say something, Lin Ze opened his mouth. “That person… is that Aunt Feng?”

“Yes, yes, yes!” Madam Lin immediately nodded.

Feng Qianhua usually treated Lin Ze very well, as if he were her own child.

There was no reason for Lin Ze not to like her.

Nanny Zhang’s words yesterday had woken her up from her dream.

If it weren’t for Nanny Zhang’s reminder, Madam Lin wouldn’t have thought of asking Lin Ze for help.

Lin Ze was Lin Jincheng’s only weakness.

Lin Jincheng couldn’t care about anyone but Lin Ze.

As long as Lin Ze had his eyes on Feng Qianhua, Lin Jincheng could only accept his fate.

As a mother, Madam Lin didn’t want to see her son alone forever.

As a grandmother, Madam Lin did not want to see her favorite grandson without a mother.

Feng Qianhua was gentle and kind, and she was so beautiful. She was also the lucky star of the Lin family. Other than her, no one else was worthy of Lin Jincheng.

After saying that, Madam Lin continued, “Ah Ze, do you want Auntie Feng to be your new mother?”

“No.” There was no emotion in Lin Ze’s voice.

Madam Lin was stunned.

She had always thought that Lin Ze liked Feng Qianhua very much.

After all, Feng Qianhua was so good to Lin Ze. When they were young, Feng Qianhua had taken care of Lin Ze quite a lot.

Lin Ze’s answer really surprised Madam Lin.

“Why?” Madam Lin asked.

“Because I have a mother of my own,” Lin Ze answered.

Madam Lin frowned. “But your mother is no longer around!”

Lin Ze looked at Madam Lin, “Grandma, you’ve always said that my mother is no longer around, but I’ve never seen my mother’s grave in my entire life. There’s no memorial tablet for her in our ancestral hall. Tell me, is my mother really no longer around?”

When Lin Ze was very young, he knew that he was different from others.

He had a special father.

He also had a mother whom he had never met.

In the past, he had been curious as to why other children had a mother but he did not.

At that time, Madam Lin’s answer was that his mother had died and was no longer with him.

But was his mother really gone?

Hearing this, Madam Lin was stunned again.

She didn’t expect Lin Ze to ask this.

For as long as she could remember, ever since Lin Ze could read and write, he had never asked questions about his mother.

Madam Lin had always thought that he didn’t care.

It turned out that it wasn’t that he didn’t care, but that he had always hidden it in his heart.

This child was so pitiful!

“Your mother is really dead!” Madam Lin sighed.

“How did she die?” Lin Ze continued to ask.

Madam Lin frowned slightly. When she thought of Ye Shu, her eyes were filled with disgust. “You just need to know that she’s dead. A dead person can’t be brought back to life. Why do you ask so much?”

“But why isn’t my mother’s memorial tablet in the ancestral hall? Why have you never taken me to her grave?”

Madam Lin felt a little sick when bombarded by Lin Ze’s questioning.

Was he questioning his grandmother’s words for the sake of a promiscuous woman?

She recalled the time when Lin Ze was a mere child. He did not even weigh four pounds back then. It was she, this old woman, who endured great pain and fed him little by little.

Did Ye Shu ever do her part as a mother?

Yet, Lin Ze was still thinking of her up to this day!

It was really chilling to the bone!

“Grandma, tell me, where is my mother?”

Madam Lin looked up at Lin Ze, with a pained expression and said, “When that woman gave birth to you, she abandoned your father and you, who had just been born, and ran away with another wild man! I didn’t expect that there would be a car accident on the way, and both of them died! Do you think that such a wicked woman with a bad history can enter our Lin family’s ancestral hall? Do you think that such a fickle woman is worthy of me bringing you to worship her?”

Ye Shu was a fickle woman to begin with, and she even gave birth to an unwanted bastard.

Madam Lin did not accuse her wrongly!

Madam Lin had not intended to take the initiative to tell Lin Ze about Ye Shu. However, since Lin Ze took the initiative to question her about it, there was no need for her to hide anything.

As days passed, Lin Ze was becoming more and more of a man. What if he suddenly saw Ye Shu one day and was bewitched by her?

Madam Lin would never allow Lin Ze to acknowledge a woman like Ye Shu as his mother!

Rather than letting Lin Ze keep thinking about this matter, it would be better to completely destroy that little thought in Lin Ze’s heart.

This was the first time he heard about his birth mother from Madam Lin, and it was so unbearable. Lin Ze couldn’t accept it immediately. “No! You’re lying! My mother isn’t that kind of person!”

Definitely not!

The mother in his dream was kind and amiable. She was a very kind and beautiful person. She was definitely not that kind of person.

Lin Ze was still a child after all. How could he accept such a blow? He almost burst into tears.

Madam Lin let out a long sigh.

“I’m your biological grandmother. Do you think I would lie to you?”

Lin Ze just looked at Madam Lin and did not say anything.

“Your Aunt Feng knows this better than anyone else. If you don’t believe me, you can ask your Aunt Feng.” Madam Lin continued, “Go and ask her if that woman has an illegitimate daughter behind your father’s back!”

After saying that, Madam Lin sighed, she said earnestly, “Your Aunt Feng is many times better than that woman! Back then, the person who was engaged to your father was also your Aunt Feng. That woman was shameless and stole your father away. She even cheated on him! Now, it’s only right and proper for your Aunt Feng to return to your father’s side. Ah Ze, I hope you can understand Grandma’s painstaking efforts.”

She scorned Ye Shu and painted her in extremely bad light. To her, Ye Shu wasn’t worthy at all!

It took Lin Ze a long time to find his voice after listening to Madam Lin’s words. “Where is my mother buried?”

“Shut up!” Madam Lin berated, “That woman doesn’t deserve you to call her mother! She is most unworthy of being a mother!”

“Is my mother not dead at all?” Lin Ze turned to look at Madam Lin.

“I told you! She’s not your mother!” After saying that, Madam Lin realized that she had raised her voice a little too loud, so she said, “Ah Ze, she’s really dead!”

“Is my mother really dead?” Lin Ze suddenly raised his head and looked into Madam Lin’s eyes.

That gaze did not seem like the gaze of an 18-year-old youth. His gaze pierced through Madam Lin.

Madam Lin looked away from Lin Ze’s eyes guiltily. “She’s dead!”

Why was a woman like Ye Shu still alive in this world?

It was better for someone like her to die early and be reborn early!

Madam Lin had never been like this before. She hoped that Ye Shu would die of a terminal illness as soon as possible.

Looking at Lin Ze’s expression, it was obvious that he was unwilling to give up.

“I want to see her.” Lin Ze continued, “Do you have a photo of her?”

“No!” Madam Lin sighed again, “Ah Ze, you’re always a good child in Grandma’s eyes! That kind of woman is really not qualified to be your mother! Only your Aunt Feng is qualified to be your mother! Regardless of family background or whatever, she is especially suitable for your father! She has waited for your father for half her life. Do you still have the heart to let her continue to wait?”

Nanny Zhang was right. How many more 18 years did a woman have?

Zhang Qianhua had given her best youth to Lin Jincheng. It was time for Lin Jincheng repay her in some way.

“She is not qualified to be my mother!” Lin Ze’s tone was very indifferent. “Grandma, anyone can be my stepmother, but Feng Qianhua can’t!”

“What’s wrong with you, child?! Your Aunt Feng has watched you grow up since you were young! How can you talk about her like that?!” Madam Lin started coughing violently.

This child usually looked quite sensible. Why was he so confused in front of the big and bad?! He would rather acknowledge a fickle woman as his mother than let Feng Qianhua become his mother.

Madam Lin’s cough became more and more serious. In the end, she wished she could cough out her lungs as well.

Lin Ze sighed and walked over to give Madam Lin a back massage.

Seeing Lin Ze come over to massage her back, Madam Lin felt a little better. No matter what, this child still loved and respected his grandmother.

Madam Lin held Lin Ze’s hand and wept, telling him that she would not live much longer. She did not want to see her son alone without a wife, and she did not want to see her grandson alone without a mother.

Feng Qianhua was such a good person.

Why did the father and son not accept her?

Madam Lin was so frustrated that she felt they would piss her to death!

Hearing his grandmother mention she was going to die soon, Lin Ze frowned and said, “I don’t like her, and I don’t like her daughter either.”

“Why?” Madam Lin looked at Lin Ze in confusion.

“There’s no reason.”

Logically speaking, over the years, Feng Qianhua had tried her best to please Madam Lin and Lin Ze.

Lin Ze should be able to accept her easily.

However, Lin Ze hated Feng Qianhua as much as he hated Feng Xianxian!

“Grandma,” Lin Ze continued, “I want to see my mother just once, can I?”

Ever since he was young, Lin Ze had never been this eager to see his mother like this.

He wanted to see whether his mother was the same as in his dream.

It was said that love was born from the heart. He wanted to see if his mother was really as unbearable as his grandmother said!

Moreover, he believed that his mother was still alive in this world.

He wanted to see his mother in person.

He wanted to ask her in front of her if she had really abandoned his father and him back then.

Otherwise, he would not be able to live with himself not knowing the truth!

He could not live with himself not knowing the truth!

He did not believe that there was really someone in this world who could be so cruel as to abandon her own flesh and blood.

“How many times do you want me to say it? That kind of woman is not qualified to be your mother!” As she spoke, Madam Lin covered her mouth and coughed again. “I don’t have a photo of her!”

“In that case, can you tell me her name and where she is from?” Lin Ze continued to ask.

With this information, he could go and ask his mother personally.

“I don’t know!” Madam Lin’s face suddenly darkened. She covered her mouth, wishing that she could cough out her lungs as well.

Did this child want to anger her to death?!

Madam Lin’s cough was usually the most intolerable. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Lin Ze patted Madam Lin’s back gently. “Grandma, don’t be angry. I won’t ask you again in the future.”

Seeing Lin Ze like this, Madam Lin couldn’t help but tear up.

The child was a good child.

It was a pity that he didn’t have a good mother!

It was all Ye Shu’s fault!

Ye Shu was an unforgivable sinner!

It was so pitiful that such a young child lost his mother!

Madam Lin held Lin Ze’s hand, “Ah Ze, everything that Grandma just told you is absolutely true. Otherwise, I would be struck by lightning! It’s okay if you don’t understand Grandma now. Grandma believes that one day, you will understand Grandma’s good intentions.”

The child was young.

He was still very much insensible.

Having lost her mother since she was young, Madam Lin could understand where the child was coming from.

After that, Madam Lin said again, “Your Aunt Feng is a good person. She’s a rare breed. She is devoted to your father. I really don’t want your father to miss out on having a lovely wife such as her! Don’t worry, after your Aunt Feng marries into our family, she will definitely treat you as her own flesh and blood…”

Lin Ze did not reply.

Just then, a servant came in with medicine. Lin Ze took the medicine and said, “Grandma, let me feed you.”

Madam Lin took the medicine and fell asleep. Before she fell asleep, Madam Lin held Lin Ze’s hand and told him to accept Feng Qianhua.

Lin Ze covered Madam Lin with the blanket and left the room.

Just then, the old butler came to look for Madam Lin.

“My grandmother is asleep.” Lin Ze closed the door softly.

The old butler nodded. “In that case, I’ll come back later.”

“Grandpa Butler.” Lin Ze spoke again. “I have something to ask you.”

“Young master, please speak.”

Lin Ze continued, “Grandpa Butler, how many years have you worked in our family?”

The Butler thought about it seriously. “It’s been 19 years.”

“Then you must know about my mother, right?” Lin Ze continued, “Can you tell me about my mother?”

Hearing this, the butler’s expression changed.

“I-I don’t know.”

Lin Ze prodded on, “Can you tell me her name?”

The butler shook his head.

“Where is she from?”

The butler shook his head once again.

“Grandpa Butler, I haven’t seen my mother since I was young. Don’t you think I’m a rather pitiful child to have grown up without a Mother?” Saying that, Lin Ze’s eyes turned a little moist.

Eighteen years.

He had only seen his mother in his dreams.

When he was in primary school, his teacher assigned him an essay with the title “A Letter to My Mother”. He could only write to his grandmother every time.

Only the butler would participate in parent-child activities.

The butler’s was a little moved. He had been in the Lin family for nineteen years. If he claimed that he did not know anything about what had happened back then, it would be fake.

Sigh!

The butler sighed and was about to say something when he saw Nanny Zhang and another servant walking over from the corner of his eye.

The words that were on the tip of his tongue immediately became, “Young Master, I really don’t know. Please don’t make things difficult for me! I still have something to do. I’ll be leaving first!”

Lin Ze looked at the butler’s retreating figure and sighed softly.

A moment later, Lin Ze took out his phone. “Li Wen, do you have time?”

They conversed for a while, then Lin Ze said, “I’ll see you at the usual place.”

After saying that, he hung up and walked out of the door.

Just as he was about to leave, he bumped into Lin Jincheng who was returning from the office.

“Ah Ze.”

“Dad.” Lin Ze stopped in his tracks.

“Where are you going? Do you need dad to send you?” Lin Jincheng was still as refined as ever, with a faint smile on his face.

“There’s no need.” Lin Ze looked at Lin Jincheng as if he had a thousand words to say, but when the words reached his mouth, there was only one left. “Daddy…”

“Ah Ze, what’s wrong?” Lin Jincheng could see that Lin Ze seemed to have something on his mind.

Lin Ze’s gaze fell on Lin Jincheng’s artificial limb, and the corners of his mouth revealed a smile. “It’s nothing, I’ll be leaving first.”

Lin Jincheng was a little worried. “If there’s anything, you must tell Daddy.”

Lin Ze nodded.

The noon sun was extremely scorching, but Lin Ze did not feel the heat at all. Instead, he felt a chill all over his body.

…

Half an hour later, a motorbike appeared on the winding mountain road at lightning speed. It was moving at a really high speed. It sped through big turns and small ones.

The motorbike was moving so fast that the friction between the tires and the ground caused green smoke to rise.

“F*ck! Brother Ze doesn’t want to live anymore!” Li Wen was originally holding a cigarette in his mouth, but when he saw this scene, the cigarette fell to the ground.

“What’s wrong with Brother Ze?” A fat boy beside him asked.

Another thin man patted the fatty. “He must be missing his mother again! Fatty Tiger and Li Wen, pay attention to what you say later!”

“Got it.” Fatty Tiger and Li Wen nodded.

Screech—

At this moment, a cool motorcycle stopped in front of them.

The helmet of the same color was taken off, revealing a young and energetic face with sharp edges.

It was Lin Ze.

“Brother Ze, catch it.” Li Wen threw a cigarette to Lin Ze.

Lin Ze tilted his head slightly and bit the cigarette.

He just held the cigarette in his mouth and didn’t light it. He said to the three of them, “Want to play?”

“Okay!”

The three of them nodded, put on their helmets, and jumped on the motorcycles. They then raced each other, speeding down the road.

While the four motorcycles were chasing each other, they experienced the excitement of adrenaline racing!

An hour later, four motorcycles stopped on the grass by the roadside.

The four teenagers were lying on the grass with their hands behind their heads, looking at the blue sky.

No one said anything.

A moment later, Lin Ze said, “Li Wen, Fat Tiger, Butt Face, what do you think of my grandmother?”

The three of them looked at each other and saw the doubt in each other’s eyes.

Fat Tiger said, “She’s alright! She’s quite passionate!”

Butt Face said, “How should I put it? I don’t know if it’s an illusion, but I feel that your grandmother doesn’t really like me hanging out with you.”

Butt Face’s family was the most ordinary of the four.

Every time he visited the Lin residence, Butt Face always felt that there was something wrong with Madam Lin’s gaze.

It felt as if she thought he would lead Lin Ze astray.

Over time, Butt Face didn’t really like visiting the Lin family residence.

Li Wen nodded in agreement. “I think so too.”

After saying that, Li Wen added, “And I heard from my grandmother that when she was young, she had a very strong personality. She wanted to grab hold of everything…”

Hearing Li Wen and Butt Face’s words, Lin Ze fell into deep thought.

He wondered…

Could it be that his mother came from an ordinary background and Madam Lin didn’t like her, which was why…

Thinking of this, Lin Ze suddenly sat up from the ground. “I must investigate it thoroughly!”

“Investigate what?” Li Wen, Fat Tiger, and Butt Face were all shocked.

Lin Ze continued, “Li Wen, how’s the investigation going?”

Li Wen shook his head, “Brother Zhao still hasn’t found any clues. I heard that many places back then produced that kind of candy. There were only a few candy wrappers, so we have no idea where they came from. However, one thing is certain. Because of the traffic, this kind of candy was only popular in the vicinity of where it was produced.”

Lin Ze thought for a moment before continuing, “Have you found out where those candies were produced?”

Li Wen tried his best to recall. “Bian Cheng, Chuan Yu, Yun Jing, and Hu Cheng! These four places seem to be the only ones.”

Lin Ze’s memory was pretty good. He immediately remembered these four addresses. He stood up from the ground and hopped onto his motorcycle. “I’m heading back first.”

Rumble!

The motorcycle kicked up dust as it sped away.

Fat Tiger scratched his head. “What do you think happened to our Brother Ze?”

Li Wen said, “He must be missing his mother. I think those paper cranes made out of candy paper must be related to Brother Ze’s mother.”

Half a month ago, Lin Ze suddenly brought a few old paper cranes made out of candy paper to him and asked him to help find out where the candy was being produced.

After checking, Li Wen found out that these candy paper cranes were 19 years old.

He didn’t know where Lin Ze got these candy paper cranes.

Fat Tiger looked in the direction where the motorcycle had disappeared and sighed deeply. “I heard that Madam Lin is going to find a stepmother for Brother Ze soon. Actually, our Brother Ze is quite pitiful.”

Li Wen frowned and said, “Don’t tell me she’s really going to let Feng Xianxian’s mother be Brother Ze’s stepmother?”

“I think it’s very possible!” Fat Tiger nodded.

Buff Face said, “It would be great if we can help Brother Ze. It’s obvious that Feng Xianxian’s mother isn’t someone easy to deal with. When that time comes, she will give Brother Ze a younger brother or something. What will happen to our Brother Ze then?”

Fat Tiger’s face was filled with worry. “It would be great if we can help brother Ze.”

Li Wen had an idea. “Fat Tiger, aren’t your grandmother and Brother Ze’s grandmother good friends? Why don’t you go back and ask your grandmother about Brother Ze’s mother?”

“Sure!” Fat Tiger nodded. “It just so happens that my grandmother’s birthday is coming up in a few days!”

…

On the other side.

Madam Cen stayed at the Ye family until the afternoon before taking a car back.

Thinking of Ye Zhuo’s beautiful face, Madam Cen’s heart stirred again. She said to the driver in the front seat, “Little Wang, I want to drop by the place where Shaoqing works.”

The Cen Group also had a branch in the Yunjing Province.

“Alright.”

Madam Cen said again, “Little Wang, how old are you this year?”

Listening to this familiar question, Little Wang’s temples twitched a few times. He remembered that the last time Madam Cen beat around the bush with him, it was to show off how beautiful her granddaughter-in-law was!

What did Madam Cen want to show off this time?

“I’m 28 this year.”

Madam Cen was stunned. “You’re already 28! Then you’re two years younger than Shaoqing. Do you have a girlfriend?”

“No,” Little Wang answered.

Madam Cen continued, “Didn’t your grandmother find you a beautiful wife?”

“No.” Little Wang shook his head.

Madam Cen leaned back in her chair with a smile on her face and sighed, “That’s right! After all, a good Chinese grandmother like me is rare to find these days! So, it’s normal that you don’t have a girlfriend!”

Xiao Wang was rendered speechless. So this time, she was here to show off herself.

The car soon arrived at where Cen Shaoqing worked.

Madam Cen got out of the car and went straight to where Cen Shaoqing worked.

“Brat! Guess who I went to see just now!”

“I can’t guess.” Cen Shaoqing held the Buddha beads in one hand and operated the computer mouse in the other, ordering his secretary to pour tea for Madam Cen.

“No sense of humor at all…” Madam Cen spread her hands helplessly. “No wonder you’re still single!”

Her heart ached for Ye Zi now. Would Ye Zi be suffocated to death by this brat in the future?!

“By the way, I have something to show you.”

Cen Shaoqing raised his head and looked at Madam Cen.

Madam Cen took out a scarf with Piglet’s page printed on it from her bag. “Do you think this scarf is cute?”

Cen Shaoqing nodded.

“Don’t you know how to speak?” Madam Cen slapped Cen Shaoqing directly.

“Cute.” Cen Shaoqing’s tone was indifferent.

Madam Cen rolled her eyes at him. “Don’t you know how to speak more than one word?”

“Very cute.”

Madam Cen said speechlessly, “Are you an emotionless speaking machine?”

Cen Shaoqing was speechless.

Madam Cen continued, “I’ll ask you again, is this scarf cute?”

“I think it’s very cute!” Cen Shaoqing answered word by word.

Madam Cen said proudly, “Of course, I picked it myself! How can it not be cute? Here, let me put it on for you. Put on Piglet and you’ll be a sociable person!”

Madam Cen reached out to tie Cen Shaoqing’s scarf, and Cen Shaoqing happened to stand up to take the documents.

Madam Cen was at most 1.6 meters tall.

Cen Shaoqing was nearly 1.9 meters tall.

There was no suitable stool for her to stand on, so she could only say, “Brat! Bend down for me!”

After saying that, she ridiculed, “What’s the use of being so tall? You can’t even get a wife!”

Facing Madam Cen childish attitude, Cen Shaoqing helplessly bent down slightly.

Madam Cen tied the scarf around Cen Shaoqing’s neck and looked him up and down before shaking her head in disgust, “So ugly! But everyone says that maternal genes are very powerful. It doesn’t matter if you’re a little ugly. My granddaughter-in-law is so beautiful. In the future, my great-grandson will definitely be super cute!”

Cen Shaoqing was once again rendered speechless.

After saying that, Madam Cen continued, “Brat, do you really not want to know where I went today?”

Cen Shaoqing shook his head. “No.”

Madam Cen took the opportunity to sit on the boss’ chair and crossed her legs.

She looked like an old lady blackmailer whom one could not afford to offend.

“I went to my granddaughter-in-law’s house.” Madam Cen glanced at Cen Shaoqing. “Shaoqing, do you really not want to know how beautiful she is?”

Ye Zhuo was so beautiful.

Madam Cen believed that as long as Cen Shaoqing saw Ye Zhuo, he would be like her. He would be charmed by Ye Zhuo and would want to marry Ye Zhuo right away.

Thinking of this scene, Madam Cen couldn’t help but cover her mouth and snicker.

“I don’t want to.” Cen Shaoqing’s tone was indifferent. Then, he added, “Grandma, I really have no intention of starting a family.”

In his life, he could at most have a confidant like Ye Zhuo.

Marriage was impossible.

It was impossible for him to get married in this life!

Madam Cen turned around and looked at Cen Shaoqing. “Brat, don’t be so full of yourself! I’m waiting for the day you run out of luck!”

“Let’s just wait then.” Cen Shaoqing said as he continued to twirl the Buddha beads.

Madam Cen fumed angrily. “How could I have a grandson like you who is nothing but a sand sculpture!”

Cen Shaoqing was rendered speechless.

…

On the other side.

After Lin Shasha went to the hospital for a check-up, she couldn’t wait to tell Zhang Qiang the good news.

As a new father, Zhang Qiang was also very excited. “Really? Shasha, are you really pregnant?”

Lin Shasha nodded.

“That’s great!” Zhang Qiang immediately picked Lin Shasha up and spun her around. “I have a son!”

Lin Shasha was speechless. “He hasn’t been born yet. How do you know it’s a son?”

Zhang Qiang smiled. “It’s definitely a son! My mother said that our Zhang family has the genes to give birth to a son. Shasha, let’s get married right away! I want to tell my parents the good news. They will definitely be very happy.”
