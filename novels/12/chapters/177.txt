Chapter 178: 086: Murder in prison! A big shot in the business world! 6

“Don’t worry, since I promised you, I Won’t go back on my word.”

Old Lady Cen smiled and said, “My family lives in No. 2 of Jinxiu Manor. Yezi, remember to come over early tomorrow! Remember to call me when you’re almost there! Forget it, I’ll call you!”

Ye Zhuo knew about Jinxiu Manor.

It was a famous wealthy district in Yunjing.

It was appropriate to describe the houses there as being worth every inch of land.

Living in such a place, Old Mrs. Cen was indeed worthy of being someone with a mine in her family! Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

After staying in the Ye family for an afternoon and repeatedly confirming that ye Zhuo would come tomorrow as promised, old Mrs. Cen reluctantly left the Ye family.

Ye Zhuo sent old Mrs. Cen to the entrance of the community.

The Cen family’s car was already waiting by the roadside.

The driver was still Xiao Wang.

After the Cen Old Lady got into the car, the smile on her face did not diminish. She leaned against the back of the chair and said, “Xiao Wang, have you been tired from driving recently?”

Xiao Wang was stunned, and a strange sense of familiarity arose.

The Cen Old Lady had taken the initiative to talk to him twice.

......

The first time was to show off that she had a beautiful granddaughter-in-law.

The second time was to show off that she was a good grandmother in China.

It was unknown what she was trying to show off this time.

It was really too difficult for him!

“Thank you for your concern, Old Mrs. Cen. I’m not tired.”

Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Have you found a girlfriend now?”

“No.”Little Wang shook his head.

Old Mrs. Cen frowned. “Last year, you were a single dog. A year has already passed. Why are you still a single dog?”

Xiao Wang:”...”it really pricked his heart!

After a long while, Xiao Wang finally managed to squeeze out a sentence. “Old Mrs. Cen, you’re so fashionable that you even know about being a single dog!”

Old Mrs. Cen was almost 90 years old this year.

It was not easy for a 90-year-old old man to be able to say such a popular internet phrase like being a single dog.

Xiao Wang recalled the last time when he told his grandmother that he was still a single dog, and his grandmother had slapped him without saying a word...

Old Mrs. Cen said with a proud face, “That’s right, I don’t only know about single dogs, I also Know About Singles’Day! Every year, on November 11th, it’s a festival for Single Dogs Like You! “Originally, my eldest grandson also wanted to celebrate this festival, but now, with the help of a good grandmother like me from China, he no longer needs to celebrate this festival! “He had no choice, who asked him to have such a good life! “To have met such a good grandmother like me! “If it weren’t for me, he would probably be like you, a single dog until now.”

Little Wang:”...”so it turned out that old Mrs. Cen was here to torture the dog today.

Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Little Wang, what do you think of my taste?”

Finally, I don’t torture the dog anymore!

Little Wang heaved a sigh of relief and nodded. “It’s pretty good.”Although Old Mrs. Cen was very old, there was really nothing to say about her outfit. Even a young man like little Wang couldn’t compare to her.

Old Mrs. Cen said proudly, “That’s right! If I didn’t have good taste, would I be able to lie to such a beautiful wife for my eldest grandson?”

Little Wang:”...”after taking such a long detour, in the end, he still could not escape the fate of being abused.

At the same time.

CEN Corporation.

In the top-floor office.

The man was dressed in a plain-colored long robe with a prayer bead in one hand and was reading documents with the other.

It was obviously a very simple action, but with every movement, he exuded a natural domineering aura that made it difficult to ignore.

“Knock, Knock, Knock.”Suddenly, there was a knock on the door.

The man raised his head slightly, revealing a pair of dark eyes. “Come in.”

The person who came was none other than Li Qiandong.

Li Qiandong was holding a stack of documents in his hand.

“Fifth brother, I need you to sign these.”

“Put them here.”

Li Qiandong continued, “By the way, fifth brother, do you know ZY Technology?”

“No.”Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddha beads with an indifferent expression.

Li Qiandong said with a face full of surprise, “Holy shit! Fifth Brother, you actually don’t know ZY! Let me tell you, this company is absolutely heaven-defying! They actually produced air-conditioned clothes! Do you know what an air-conditioned clothes is? It’s the kind of clothes that can adjust the temperature! ZY company has only been registered for a few months, and they’re already preparing to go public! Even the European and American markets are afraid of them!”

ZY technology company was an emerging industry, but its momentum was unexpectedly fierce! Every time a new product came out, no matter how high the unit price was, it would be snapped up.

Among them, the appointment of the gold-medal designer z was even arranged until after the new year.

With the current situation, it would not be long before ZY company would become a giant in the business world!
