“Chapter 2151: 443: at the family recognition banquet, she will be the most beautiful existence! 1”

Translator: 549690339

“At that time, those who will attend the family recognition banquet will all be people who support her. ”

“Naturally, ye Zao will also become a clown! ”

“Whenever Duanmu Feng thought of that scene, she would feel extremely excited. She wanted to immediately travel back to the day of the family recognition banquet and ruthlessly slap ye Zao in the face. ”

Ye Zao was just an ugly duckling. How could he compare to her?

“She would let ye Zao know that the ugly duckling could only be an ugly duckling forever, and that the White Swan would never be an ugly duckling! ”

“Mrs. Duanmu thought for a moment and continued, “I’m not too sure about the exact time. It’ll probably be in the next two days.” ”

“The Duanmu family’s position in front of the headquarters was no longer the same as before. As for the details of the family identification banquet, she wasn’t too sure either. ”

“Ever since Duanmu Fenfei was locked up, those who were on good terms with the Duanmu family couldn’t help but avoid him. ”

“At the thought of this, a heavy haze flashed across Mrs. Duanmu’s eyes. ”

“However, this was a good thing. ”

“If one didn’t experience some hardships, one would never know whether the person standing beside one was a ghost or a human. ”

“After saying this, Mrs. Duanmu continued, “Fengyu, the most important thing for you now is to arrange the family recognition banquet. You must remember that on the day of the family recognition banquet, you will be the main character. As for the others, they will all be your foil!” ”

Success or failure depended on this one move. Duanmu Fengyu had to seize this opportunity to become a phoenix in one leap!

“If she missed the family identification banquet, Duanmu Fengyu really wouldn’t have the chance to soar to the sky. ”

“As for jumping to her feet, it was naturally ye Zhuo. ”

Only ye Zhuo’s inferiority could bring out Duanmu Fengyu’s excellence.

“Looking at it from another perspective, it was actually a good thing that ye Zhuo could come to the alliance with Cen Shaoqing. If it wasn’t for Ye Zhuo, Cen Haifeng and the others would never have seen Duanmu Fengyu’s excellence. ”

“Yes.”Duanmu fengyu nodded. “I know.”

“Mrs. Duanmu continued, “Are you still in contact with Ye Han of the Chang Yue country and Leo of the insect race?” ”

“”Yes.”Duanmu fengyu continued, “Don’t worry. As long as I say the word, they will definitely come over to support us.” ”

“Duanmu Feng had a wide social network and knew how to conduct herself. She had a good relationship with Ye Han and Leo. She had even met Miss ye of the Chang Yue country once. Unfortunately, that Miss Ye had a cold personality and did not smile, if not, she and Miss Ye would definitely become bosom friends! ”

“That’s good.”Mrs. Duanmu nodded.

“Speaking up to this point, Mrs. Duanmu seemed to have thought of something. “Oh right, I heard that Ye Zhuo and miss ye of the Changyue Kingdom share the same name. Is that true?” ”

“”Yes,”duanmu feng continued, “Not only do their names look similar, they also look similar.” ”

This was also the most disgusting part of Duanmu Fengyu and Ye Zhuo.

“Miss Ye was dazzling. It was fine if she overpowered her in every aspect. After all, Miss Ye really had strength. ”

“Although she envied Miss Ye, she was not jealous. ”

But what was Ye Zhuo?

She was just an extremely ordinary earthling. Why should she overpower her?

Based on her face?

“If not for Mrs. Duanmu telling her to endure it, Duanmu Fengyu would not have been able to endure it. ”

“”You can make a fuss about this.”Mrs. Duanmu narrowed her eyes, then, she said, “Fengyu, think about it. Ye Han and Leo are both supporters of Miss Ye. What do you think they will do if they know that an imposter of Miss Ye has appeared in the Alliance?” ” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“If they wanted to overthrow ye Zao, they could not let Duanmu Feng make a move on them. ”

They had to borrow someone else’s hands.

“For example, Leo and Ye Han. ”

“Of these two people, one was the master of Long Yue and the other was the master of the insect clan. ”

They could crush ye Zao to death with just a finger.

“Hearing this, Duanmu Feng You’s lips curled up. “Mom, you’re right.” ”

Ye Han was ye Zao’s younger brother.

“If ye Han knew that someone was using ye Zhuo’s face to swindle people in the Alliance, would ye Han let it go? ”

There was also Leo.

“The bug race had always been brutal, and Leo was even more ruthless in killing people. Even duanmu Fengyu had spent a lot of effort to get Leo to look at her twice. ”

“Before he met Ye Zhuo, Leo and the Chang Yue country were sworn enemies. All he thought about was how to dominate the Chang Yue country. ”

Until ye Zhuo appeared.

The two of them could be considered to have known each other without fighting.

Leo had never submitted to anyone in his life. Ye Zhuo was the first and the only one.

“Therefore, Leo respected ye Zhuo a lot. ”

“Thinking of this, the curve on Duanmu Feng’s face became more and more intense. She then said, “Mom, I’ll go and contact Leo and Ye Han right now!” ”
