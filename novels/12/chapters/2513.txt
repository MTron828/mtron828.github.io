128 floors.

“Standing here, one could almost see the entire night sky of the South China Sea. ”

Pa..

“At this moment, the phone slid from his hand to the ground. ”

“The screen was lit, and one could vaguely see the content on the screen. ”

It was the Weibo trending page.

The top ten trending pages were basically all contracted by ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing.

News of their marriage had spread all over the world.

“Boss.”

“At that moment, his assistant walked in from outside the door and greeted song Shiyu respectfully. ”

Song Shiyu calmly picked up the phone on the ground and looked up at his assistant. “What’s Wrong?”

“The assistant continued, “Doctor Liu is here.” ”

Song Shiyu then remembered that today was his day for a routine check-up.

“”Let him in,”he said softly. ”

His indifferent voice sounded no different from usual.

“Okay.”The assistant nodded and turned to walk out of the door.

“Soon, doctor Liu came up with the medical kit. ”

“Boss song.”

Song Shiyu turned slightly. “Doctor Liu.”

“Doctor Liu continued, “How has boss song been feeling recently? Is there any discomfort?” ”

“”I’ve been doing quite well recently,”song Shiyu replied. ”

Doctor Liu did not quite believe song Shiyu’s words. He put down the medical kit and checked song Shiyu’s pulse.

“A moment later, he looked at song Shiyu in surprise. His eyes were filled with disbelief. ”

It had only been a few days!

Song Shiyu had actually recovered a lot!

“”Boss song, you haven’t touched those things in the past few days?” ”

Song Shiyu nodded. “Yes.” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“After saying that, he continued, “You’re right. A person should not only be responsible for others, but also be responsible for himself.” ”

“As a doctor, Doctor Liu was very gratified that song Shiyu had such an awareness. He smiled and said, “Boss song, if you can keep it up, you won’t be far from recovery.” ”

“”Yes, I’ll keep it up,”song Shiyu said. ”

“After saying that, song Shiyu continued, “Make your preparations. I’m preparing to return to Yun Jing Tomorrow.” ”

“Okay.”Doctor Liu nodded.

“After leaving song Shiyu’s place, doctor Liu whispered to the butler, “Boss song, have you encountered any good news recently?” ”

“The Butler was stunned. “Why do you say that, doctor Liu?” ”

“Doctor Liu continued, “Boss song has changed so much. Have you not noticed it at all?” ”

“The butler said, “Third Master’s schedule has indeed been much more stable recently. He has also taken his medicine on time. However, he has been at home recently and has not seen anyone.” ”

“Doctor Liu asked doubtfully, “Really?” ”

The Butler shook his head.

“Doctor Liu touched his chin and said, “That’s strange. I thought boss song had encountered something happy.” ”

“After that, doctor Liu continued, “Has boss song always been alone?” ”

“Yes.”The butler nodded.

Doctor Liu narrowed his eyes. “How can he be alone? hasn’t he thought of finding someone?”

“The Butler shook his head. “Third master has a cold personality. When the old lady was still alive, he could still talk about him. Now that the old lady is gone, he probably doesn’t want to have a family anymore.” ”

Saying that he was cold was just a euphemism.

Song Shiyu’s personality was very strange. He was temperamental. There had been people who sent women to him before.

Yan Huan was fat and thin.

But song Shiyu had never looked these people in the eye.

“Gradually, no one sent people to Song Shiyu’s side. ”

“Did he suffer a blow?”Doctor Liu was a little curious. “Or did he suffer emotional trauma before?”

A heart ailment needed a heart medicine.

Doctor Liu was a doctor. The first thing he thought of was how to solve song Shi’s problem.

“I’m not too sure about that either.”The Butler shook his head. “But third master should not have suffered emotional trauma before.”

How could a girl who was not in a relationship get hurt?

“The butler continued, “Maybe it’s his nature.” ”

“Doctor Liu did not quite agree with this statement. He continued, “No one is born like this. This kind of situation is mostly formed after birth.” ”

The Butler did not say anything.

“Doctor Liu continued, “Actually, I can tell that boss song is a good person.” ”

“At least, he did not do any bad things. ”

“The butler sighed softly. “Unfortunately, in this world, good people often do not get good karma.” ”

“Although the Butler did not say much, doctor Liu could read many things from his eyes. ”

Some words could only be understood without words.

“In the past, Song Shiyu did not fight for anything. He only wanted to live a good life, but the people around him did not let him go. ”

That was why he became what he was today.
