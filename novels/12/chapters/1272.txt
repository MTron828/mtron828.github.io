Xu Yao Knew Ye Zao.

That was because her sister Xu Yan and ye Zao were junior high school classmates.

Ye Zao was a delinquent in junior high school.

“When she reached the age of high school, because she didn’t pass, the Mu family spent money to let her enter North Bridge High School. ”

“But with a person like her, even if she spent money to enter high school, she wouldn’t be able to achieve anything. ”

Later on.

“When the Xu family moved to the capital, Xu Yao didn’t hear much about ye Zao. ”

“Later on, when Xu Yao heard about ye Zao, she had already gone from a high and mighty daughter of the Mu family to a fake daughter that everyone despised. ”

She had occupied the real daughter’s life for 18 years.

She was simply Shameless.

“Therefore, she didn’t have a good impression of ye Zao. ”

Xu Yao did not expect to see ye Zao in the Technical Department of the police station today.

How did captain Li Introduce Ye Zao Just Now?

The computer expert specially assigned by the higher-ups?

“Seeing Xu Yao like this, captain li said, “Xu Yao, do you know each other?” ”

“Xu Yao only then reacted and shook her head with a smile. She took the initiative to reach out her hand to ye Zao. “Hello, Miss Ye. I’m Xu Yao, a double Xu, Yao from the Yao Lake.” ”

“”Ye Zao. My mouth is made of wood, and my mouth is made of wood.”Ye Zao held Xu Yao’s hand. ” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“After introducing each other, ye Zao leaned into the chair and went straight to the point. “What time does the surveillance camera disappear from?” ”

Captain Li looked at Xu Yao.

“Xu Yao’s eyes were filled with mockery as she continued, “From 8:10 to 9:00.” ”

She wanted to see if ye Zao could really restore the surveillance footage.

“Okay.”

“Ye Zao pressed the keyboard with one hand and used the mouse with the other. The air was filled with the sound of typing, and his fair hands formed afterimages. ”

The collision between white and black was so beautiful that it was soul-stirring.

Captain Li did not understand computers.

“Seeing that ye Zao did not even lower his head to look at the keyboard and was typing so quickly, his eyes were filled with amazement. “This is called blind typing, right? It’s too fast! How many years of training do you have to do this!” ”

“If captain Li had a problem, it would be in the technical department. He did not even use a computer at all. Usually, he would have to search for half a day to Type A word on the computer. It was still the type where he would raise his index finger and look for letters one by one. For someone like ye Zao, he would open all ten fingers, the typing speed was so fast that it was too fast for one’s eyes to take in. Even if a professional saw it, he would probably be a little amazed. ”

“”It’s pretty fast indeed.”Xu Yao stood behind ye Zao and frowned slightly. She continued, “Is this really how you can repair the surveillance cameras?” ”

“As the saying goes, an expert watches the door while an amateur watches the show. ”

“Captain Li did not know much about computers, so he felt that ye Zao was very good at operating them so quickly! ”

“However, in the eyes of an expert like Xu Yao, Ye Zao was just messing around. There was no logic to it at all. ”

She did not know anything about computers at all!

It was simply a waste of time.

“”Captain Li, come out with me for a moment,”she said in a low voice. ”

Captain Li followed Xu Yao’s footsteps.

The two of them went outside.

“Captain li asked curiously, “Xu Yao, why did you have to come outside when you couldn’t say anything inside?” ”

“Xu Yao continued, “Captain Li, are you mistaken?” ”

“Mistaken about what?”Captain Li didn’t quite understand what Xu Yao meant.

“Xu Yao said, “Are you sure that ye Zhuo is a computer expert sent by the higher-ups?” ”

“Of course!”Captain Li nodded. “Miss Ye was personally brought to our task force by Chief Liu.”

Xu Yao frowned. “But ye Zao doesn’t know anything about computers!”

“Captain Li continued, “Isn’t miss ye quite amazing? She can type so fast! I think the typist, Xiao Nie, can’t even be faster than her!”The typist, Xiao Nie, could type more than 500 words in a minute. ”

But Captain Li didn’t see the shock that ye Zhuo brought when he saw Xiao nie type.

“Xu Yao explained, “Captain Li, it doesn’t mean that she doesn’t know about computers. Take reading for example. After reading a book and flipping through a book, can the results be the same?” ”

“After reading a book, it would take a few days to understand a book. ”

“But after flipping through a book, it would only take a few seconds. ”

Ye Zao’s current behavior was no different from flipping through a book.

Forcefully pretending to be 13!

“If that was the case, then captain Li would understand. Xu Yao was a top student and a computer science graduate, so she wouldn’t say anything. ”

But Ye Zao was brought over by Chief Liu.

“Captain Li narrowed his eyes and continued, “Are you sure that ye Zao doesn’t know about computers?” ”

“”Yes, I’m sure.”Xu Yao’s gaze was firm, then, she continued, “Captain Li, to tell you the truth, my sister and Ye Zao are classmates. Ye Zao’s reputation in our city didn’t sound good before. Adding up the four subjects in the middle school entrance examination, he only scored 15 points. “The high school entrance examination was invested by my family.” ”
