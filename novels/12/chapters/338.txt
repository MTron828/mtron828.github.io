“Because ye Shu had been urging ye Sen to bring Bai Wei back to meet her as soon as possible, ye Sen told Bai Wei about this matter. ”

“Hearing this, Bai Wei was extremely happy. ”

She could finally meet ye Shu.

“But she still pretended to be very nervous. “Ye Sen, what if your sister doesn’t like me? Will you break up with me?” ”

“Ye Sen smiled and said, “You’re So Nice. It’s impossible for my sister not to like you.” ”

“In Ye Sen’s eyes, Bai Wei was a rare good girl. ”

Bai Wei’s face was full of shyness. “I’m not as Nice as you say.”

“Ye Sen continued, “Then this Sunday morning. Do you have time? If you have time, I’ll pick you up!” ”

“Bai Wei hesitated for a moment. “I have two classes on Sunday morning, but it’s okay. I’ll just switch with another teacher.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Sen nodded.

“Because Bai Wei was going to be a guest on Sunday, on Saturday.., ”

“Because it was Saturday, there were a lot of people in the mall. ”

“Ye Zao held ye Shu’s arm and led her to a high-end skincare shop. “Mom, go buy some skincare products! Although your skin is in good condition, you are at the age where you should take care of it.” ”

“Ye Shu was 39 years old this year. Although there were no signs of aging on her face, if she didn’t take care of it, she would age very easily! ”

“Ye Shu originally wanted to refuse, but after hearing what ye Zao said, she didn’t refuse and followed ye Zao to the store. ”

“This was a very big brand skincare store. Sister counter was very perceptive. When she saw ye Shu and her daughter, she immediately greeted them warmly, “Ladies, what would you like to see?” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “This is my mother. Please recommend some moisturizing and wrinkle-resistant outfits to her.” ”

Sister counter immediately introduced them to Ye Shu.

“Ye Shu listened very seriously. “Alright, this one then.” ”

“Seeing that ye Shu was so straightforward, sister counter immediately recommended other suits to Ye Shu. “There’s a recent event. If you buy this suit together with the one that you’ve just taken a fancy to, you can enjoy a discount of 85% .” ”

“Ye Shu knew the marketing methods of the merchants. She smiled and said, “I’ll take this one first! I’ll buy it again when I’m done.” ”

“The shopkeeper was a tactful person. Hearing this, she immediately didn’t say anything more. She wrapped the things up and brought ye Shu to pay the bill. ”

“Ye Shu originally wanted to bring Bai Wei a set too, but she didn’t know what kind of Skin Bai Wei had, so she didn’t buy it for her. ”

“Slap!”

“In the originally quiet environment, a crisp slap was suddenly heard, followed by a sharp and mean voice: ”

“”Where’s your store manager? Quickly call her over, I want to file a complaint against you!” ”

This voice instantly attracted the attention of all the customers in the store.

Everyone turned to look at the source of the sound.

“However, not only did the main character of the incident not restrain himself, he became even more arrogant, looking like he was high and mighty. ”

“Half of the shopkeeper’s face was red and swollen after being slapped by her, and she lowered her head and sobbed. ”

“The store manager quickly ran over from the other side. “Miss Bai! This employee is new. She was careless and brought you unhappiness. I’m really sorry! Little Wang, hurry up and apologize to Miss Bai!” ”

This Miss Bai was called Bai Wei.

Bai Wei was a senior member of their store. She would come over every month to do maintenance.

“She was generous. Naturally, the store manager would not offend a senior member like Bai Wei because of an employee. ”

“Therefore, no matter whose fault it was, it was the employee’s fault! ”

“The employee who was beaten looked up at the store manager and said aggrievedly, “Store manager, this has nothing to do with me. She was the one who hit me first...” ”

“The store manager frowned and berated coldly, “Little Wang! Do you want to quit? !” ”

“The wages of high-end skincare stores were very high, and the commission was also high. Occasionally, there would be customers who gave tips. ”

“Back then, Little Wang had gone through a lot of trouble to become a shopkeeper. Naturally, she did not want to lose her job. At that moment, she could only endure the grievance and apologize. ”

“In the world of adults, what was the point of being wronged? ”

“Although Little Wang apologized, Bai Wei was still a little dissatisfied. ”

“The store manager then took out a beautiful gift box, “Miss Bai, for the sake of her being a new employee, adults should forgive her for her wrongdoings! “Oh right, this is a new model that just arrived in our shop. It has a very good hydrating effect!”! “I’m giving it to you now. I know that just a set of hydrating products will definitely not catch your eye, Miss Bai. Please take it as a small gift from our shop. Please accept it.” ”
