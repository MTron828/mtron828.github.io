Chapter 645: 150: a strong comeback. Feng Xianxian was dumbfounded. It turned out to be ye Zao! 1

Translator: 549690339

This was master Yu!

Ye Zao had to go a little further if he wanted to show off!

Did she think that she was some godly doctor?

She actually thought that she could cure Yu Zho.

It was simply a fantasy!

It was unreasonable.

“If anything happened to Master Yu, the entire Lin family would be in trouble. ”

Old Lady Lin was so angry that her entire body was trembling. She wanted nothing more than to make ye Zao disappear right before her eyes.

Lin Jincheng raised his head and looked at Old Lady Lin. “Mother! Zao Zao is not that kind of child who is fooling around! My illness was cured by taking the medicine that Zao Zao gave me! I believe that she will definitely be able to cure master Yu!”

Crazy!

Crazy!

Lin Jincheng was definitely crazy! Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

He actually believed that ye Zao would cure Master Yu.

This was a matter of life and death!

Lin Jincheng actually did not take it seriously.

“Old Lady Lin clutched her chest and pushed her back a few steps. Lin Qingxuan supported Old Lady Lin from behind. “Mom, I believe in Zao Zao too. Please let her try.” ”

Yes.

Lin Qingxuan also believed in ye Zao.

“This was because the ointment that ye Zao had given her to remove the swelling and silt was very effective. After applying it for less than a day, the bruise on her face disappeared without a trace. ”

“Even in foreign countries, Lin Qingxuan had never seen such an effective ointment. ”

“As far as he knew, that ointment was developed by Ye Zao himself. ”

No one with medical skills could develop a ointment?

“Seeing that Lin Qingxuan had said the same thing, Old Madam Lin was even angrier. ”

“This one or two, it was as if they had no brains! ”

They actually believed that ye Zao could cure diseases!

Feng Qianhua and Feng Xianxian looked at each other without saying a word.

Both of them could see the pride in each other’s eyes.

Ye Zao had really messed up today.

Just wait and see.

“Once master Yu breathed his last, Ye Zao was going to be in big trouble. ”

Ye Zao continued to apply the needles on his hands.

“Assistant Ma turned to look at Lin Jincheng and frowned. “Mr. Lin Si, Mr. Lin Wu, are you sure that your Lin family’s eldest daughter can really save Master Yu?” ”

“Lin Jincheng nodded seriously. “Yes, I’m sure.” ”

Lin Qingxuan nodded as well. “I’m sure too.”

“Assistant Ma turned on his phone and switched on the recording mode. “Mr. Lin Si, Mr. Lin Wu, I’m starting to record the video now! Let me ask you again. Are you sure that the Lin family’s eldest daughter Can Save Master Yu?” ”

Lin Jincheng nodded without any hesitation.

Lin Qingxuan was the same.

They all trusted ye Zao very much.

“Assistant MA continued, “Then let me say something ugly first. If anything happens to master Yu after receiving Miss Lin’s treatment, the Lin family will bear all the consequences!” ”

“Lin Jincheng said, “Zao Zao is my daughter. If anything happens, I, Lin Jincheng, will bear all the responsibility alone!” ”

“”And me,”Lin Qingxuan continued, “I’m also willing to take full responsibility for my eldest niece.” ”

“Qingxuan! Jincheng! Are you crazy?”Old Lady Lin was furious.

“Feng Qianhua said in a timely manner, “Fourth brother, Brother Jincheng, Zhonghua is just a child. Aren’t you guys too hasty in making such a decision?” ”

It wasn’t just hasty.

It was simply a disregard for human life.

“Lin Qingxuan raised her head to look at Feng Qianhua. “Qianhua, this is, after all, a family matter of our Lin family.” ”

She was secretly meddling in Feng Qianhua’s business.

“An awkward expression flashed across Feng Qianhua’s face before disappearing quickly. She continued, “But this is, after all, related to master Yu’s safety. Isn’t it not too good to let burning cause trouble like this? Aunt Lin is also thinking of the Lin family.” ”

Feng Qianhua was the only one who came out to speak up for her.

“Old Madam Lin looked at Feng Qianhua, her eyes filled with gratitude. ”

Old Madam Lin was completely disappointed with Lin Jincheng and Lin Qingxuan.

“Lin Qingxuan continued, “You don’t have to worry about this. We all believe in searing.” ”

With that said.

Feng Qianhua couldn’t say anything else.

Since they all believed in ye Zao so much.

Then they should suffer a little!

There would be times when they would regret it.

“Feng Qianhua’s lowered eyes flashed with a proud light. To her, this was not a bad thing! ”

“After master Yu died from the treatment, could ye Shu and ye Zao continue to stay in the Lin Family? ”

They could be considered to have suffered the consequences of their actions.

Old Lady Lin thumped her chest and stamped her feet. “An unfilial descendant! An unfilial descendant! How could our Lin family have such an unfilial descendant!”

“Feng Qianhua comforted Old Lady Lin. “Aunt Lin, don’t worry. What if a miracle happens?” ”

“If a miracle really happened that easily, then it wouldn’t be called a miracle. ”
