“After hanging up the phone, Li Qiandong ran to Mu Yourong’s side. “Yourong, I have a good friend who has come to cloud capital. I’m going to see him now. He’ll be back in a while.” ”

“Mu Yourong nodded. “Big Brother Li, you go and do your work.” ”

Li Qiandong arrived at the location he had agreed upon with he ziteng.

“Ziteng!”

He Ziteng waved at Li Qiandong. “Qiandong!”

“The two of them were very good friends to begin with. After not seeing each other for a long time, they immediately gave each other a big hug. ”

“Li Qiandong asked, “Ziteng, why have you come to Yun Jing?” ”

“He ziteng nodded. “Yes, I came to Yun Jing to acknowledge my master.” ”

“Acknowledge your master?”Li Qiandong asked in surprise. “Who are you looking for?”

He ziteng took out his phone and showed Li Qiandong a video.

It was a racing video.

“After watching the video, Li Qiandong said excitedly, “Ziteng, I know the person you are looking for!” ”

“Who is she?”He ziteng was also very excited.

“Li Qiandong continued, “She is the eldest daughter of the Mu family, Mu Yourong!” ”

“Li Qiandong had personally asked mu yourong about the racing video, and Mu Yourong had also admitted that this person was her. ”

“He ziteng’s family background was very good. With his help, Mu Yourong would definitely be able to make the MU group Rise Again! ” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Hearing this, he ziteng immediately grabbed Li Qiandong’s hand. “Qiandong! Quickly take me to see her!” ”

“Li Qiandong continued, “I might not be able to today. There’s been some unforeseen events in the Mu family recently, and she’s busy moving house. How about tomorrow? Let’s meet at the Imperial Cafe Tomorrow!” ”

“Although he ziteng was anxious to acknowledge him as his master, he was not in a hurry. He nodded and said, “Alright, then I’ll go and see Fifth Brother First!” ”

“After bidding he ziteng goodbye, Li Qiandong immediately told mu yourong the good news. ”

“Hearing this, Mu Yourong was very excited. ”

She knew about the he family.

Their family background was not inferior to the Li family’s.

“With He Ziteng and Li Qiandong as stepping stones, what was there to be afraid of? ”

“Although she was very happy, Mu Yourong did not show it. Instead, she hesitated, “Big Brother Li, something like this just happened at my house. I’m really not in the mood to talk about racing right now. Why Don’t you let Young Master he go back?” ”

It was not that she did not want to talk about racing.

“Without the help of the system, she would not be able to race at all. ”

“If he ziteng asked her to show off her driving skills, she would have something to deal with. ”

“Li Qiandong said, “Ziteng is very stubborn. He won’t give up until he sees you. Even if you don’t want to talk about racing with him now, it’s okay to meet him! “I’ve already arranged to meet him at the Imperial Cafe. You Can’t make things difficult for me, right?” ”

“Mu yourong continued, “Brother Li, since you’ve already agreed, I’ll go tomorrow to not make things difficult for you.” ”

“”That’s great! Yourong, thank you!” ”

The next day.

He Ziteng arrived at the Imperial Cafe as promised.

“Not long after he sat down, Li Qiandong brought mu yourong over. ”

“Li Qiandong took the initiative to introduce, “Ziteng, this is Miss Mu! The person driving the car in the video is her! yourong, this is he ziteng, who wants to acknowledge you as his master! He really admires you!” ”

“He Ziteng did not expect Mu Yourong to be so young and pretty. He immediately stretched out his hand. “Hello, Miss Mu. I’ve finally met you! Your driving skills are really very good!” ”

He ziteng really admired Mu Yourong.

“If he had not seen it with his own eyes, he would not have believed that a girl could actually drive so well. ”

“”Mr. He, you flatter me.”Mu Yourong was very modest. ”

“He ziteng handed the menu to Mu Yourong. “What would you like to drink, Miss Mu?” ”

Mu Yourong took the menu. “A cup of Blue Mountain will do.”

The three of them sat down to drink coffee. Li Qiandong intentionally brought up the topic of the Mu Corporation.

“He ziteng said, “Don’t worry, Miss Mu. Your Business is my business. I guarantee that the MU corporation will regain its former glory!” ”

“As long as she could successfully acknowledge him as her master, this small problem was nothing. ”

“Hearing this, Li Qiandong heaved a sigh of relief. ”

Mu Yourong was also extremely happy.

She knew that she would not live in that kind of slum.

“At this moment, a man in a suit and tie walked to the table and stopped. He said respectfully, “Young Master He.” ”

“Special Assistant Zhou?”He ziteng looked up in surprise. “Why are you here?”

“Special Assistant Zhou took out his tablet, then, he said, “Master Wu asked me to come. He asked me to show you this video to remind you not to be fooled! The real driver is someone else. It has nothing to do with Miss Mu!” ”

“After saying that, Special Assistant Zhou turned to look at Li Qiandong. ”

“”Young master Li, Master Wu also asked me to tell you one more thing: it’s not your fault for being stupid, but it’s your fault for coming out and embarrassing yourself!” ”
