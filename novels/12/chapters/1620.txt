“Ye Zao was sitting in the main control cabin, operating the system. There was almost no expression on his face, and he was extremely calm. ”

“Cen Jiang.”

“At this moment, ye Zao pressed the communicator beside his ear. ”

“”Miss Ye, please speak.”Cen Jiang quickly replied. ”

“Ye Zao continued, “Activate the defense system.” ”

“Okay.”Cen Jiang sat in front of the defense system’s seat and activated the main button. Blue laser beams immediately appeared in the air.

A cold electronic voice came from the air. [ the defense system has been activated! ]

“”Miss Ye, the defense system has been activated!”Cen Jiang continued. ”

“Okay.”Ye Zao’s voice was shallow. “Don’t turn it off before I speak.”

“Ye Zao tested the defense system. There were no problems, so he checked the flight system and the attack system. ”

“After confirming that there were no problems, ye Zao got down from the main cabin and said to his assistant beside him, “We have an early shift today. Let everyone get off work. Everyone has worked hard during this period of time!” ” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“”Okay.”The assistant nodded. “Thank you, Miss Ye!” ”

“When they learned that ye Zao had let everyone get off work early, everyone was very happy and almost cheered out loud. ”

Tang Xue called her personal assistant over. “Arrange a few people to follow ye Zao to prevent her from escaping!”

“What the Internet said was right. As the launch ceremony was getting closer and closer, and the aircraft carrier plan had failed, ye Zao must have already planned the route and was thinking of how to escape! ”

She could not let ye Zao escape!

“If ye Zao escaped, how would she slap ye Zao’s face and torture him? ”

“Okay.”The assistant nodded.

“Wait a minute.”Tang Xue called the assistant again.

“Do you have any other instructions?”The assistant turned to look at Tang Xue.

“Tang Xue continued, “Ye Zao is a very vigilant person. Arrange a few smart people and don’t let ye Zao find out! Inform me immediately if you find ye Zao entering or leaving the airport!”Earth was so big, once ye Zao escaped from China, it would be like looking for a needle in a haystack! ”

“Therefore, she had to make preparations in advance and not give ye Zao the slightest chance to escape! ”

“Alright!”The assistant nodded.

“Tang Xue waved her hand. “Alright, go and make the arrangements!” ”

The assistant turned around and walked out.

“Looking at the back of the assistant, Tang Xue narrowed her eyes. ”

“This time, ye Zao would be unable to escape even if he had wings! ”

On the other side.

Tang Mi came home from work.

“When Xiao Qing saw Tang Mi coming back, he said in surprise, “Why are you back so early today?” ”

“Tang mi massaged her temples and said somewhat tiredly, “I’ve been working overtime these few days, so miss ye told us to leave work early and let us have a good rest.”During this period of time, in the large C district, they would only get off work at 9:10 pm and go to work at 8:00 am. By the time they got home from work, it was already 11:00 pm! She was almost exhausted. ”

“How’s the construction of your aircraft carrier going?”Xiao Qing asked.

“She had been watching the news all day, and the more she read, the more anxious she became. ”

“Tang Mi was only responsible for the defense system, “I’m not too sure about the details, but judging from Miss Ye’s condition, there shouldn’t be any problems with the aircraft carrier taking off! “Mom, don’t worry. Whether it’s a blessing or a curse, it can’t be avoided! “Things have already come to this point. It’s useless for you to be anxious.” ”

“A month ago, Tang Mi was also a little anxious. She had thought of many outcomes. ”

What if the aircraft carrier plan failed?

“But the closer it was to the aircraft carrier taking off, the Calmer Tang Mi became. ”

“No matter what the outcome was, she would accept it unconditionally. ”

So what if the aircraft carrier plan really failed?

At least she had worked hard for it before.

“”You are a member of the aircraft carrier plan, and you don’t even have confidence in yourself. How can you tell me not to worry!”Xiao Qing frowned, “Tang Mi, I told you a long time ago that the aircraft carrier plan would never succeed. You didn’t listen to me! How is it now? Have you seen the result?” ”

“Tang mi smiled and changed the topic, then said, “Mom, I’m hungry. is the meal ready?” ”

“Xiao Qing knew that she was changing the topic. He said helplessly, “It’s already so late, and you’re still thinking about eating! The fire is about to burn!” ”

“As a parent, Xiao Qing couldn’t be in no hurry at all. ”

“”A person is iron rice and steel. No matter what, you can’t forget to eat!”Tang mi held Xiao Qing’s hand, she smiled and said, “Mom, I’ve said it before. Since I’ve chosen this path, I’ll never regret it! So, you don’t have to worry. Just accept the reality.” ”

Xiao Qing sighed.

Don’t worry.

“This sentence was easy to say, but it was not so easy to do. ”
