“”This thing really needs to be delivered by me personally before I can rest assured,”ye Lan said. ”

“Hearing this, autumn flute smiled and said, “What is it?” ”

“”You’ll know once you see it,”ye Lan said. ”

“With that said, autumn flute was a little curious. He looked at Ye Lan, but did not see any suspicious items in ye Lan’s hands. ”

Ye Lan raised her hand and high-fived.

Clap Clap Clap —

“No More, no less, just three times. ”

“Just as the applause ended, two assistants carrying boxes walked in from outside the door. “Chief Ye.” ”

“”Put it there,”ye Lan said. ”

“Okay.”The assistant nodded and carefully placed the box on the ground. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The dark red box looked a little old.

“What is this?”Qiu Di asked curiously.

“”You’ll know when you open it,”ye Lan said. ”

Open it and see?

Autumn flute raised his eyebrows slightly. He really couldn’t understand what ye Lan was up to.

“Ye Lan smiled and pulled Autumn Flute’s hand. “Young miss, open it.” ”

Autumn flute was pulled by ye Lan to the front of the box. She reached out and opened it.

“In an instant, the light was boundless. ”

It was that kind of blinding light.

What was this?

The autumn flute covered the confusion in her eyes and looked inside.

“In the next second, she saw a golden robe embroidered with a phoenix pattern lying in the chest. ”

“In the Chang Yue country, only the sovereign had the right to wear clothes embroidered with a phoenix pattern. ”

“If the autumn flute could wear this robe on the day of the election, how glorious would it be! ”

The most important thing was.

Ye Zao had worn this dress once before when he took office.

“If Qiu Di could wear it again, it also meant that ye Zao approved of her. ”

“At that time, would she still be afraid that Qiu di would not be able to win over the hearts of the people? ”

“Looking at this phoenix robe, a light flashed in Qiu Di’s eyes. ”

“She was originally thinking about how to get this phoenix robe, but unexpectedly, in the blink of an eye, Ye Lan had given it to her with both hands! ”

“The corners of Qiu Di’s mouth curled up, his eyes filled with pride. ”

“Ye Lan had not been able to successfully change the Ye clan’s base into the Qiu clan’s base. She had always felt that she had let down Qiu Di’s great love, so she had thought of a way to crack the password and take out this robe from the national treasury. ”

“Looking at the smile on Qiu Di’s face, she knew that her decision was not wrong! ”

Qiu Di should be very satisfied now.

“Ye Lan looked at Qiu Di and continued, “This Phoenix Robe is a little gift from me, young miss. Please accept it.” ”

“”Sister Ye Lan, how can I thank you?”Qiu Di looked at Ye Lan. ”

“Ye Lan smiled and said, “Young Miss, you shouldn’t have said that. After all, this is something that belongs to you.” ”

Qiu Di felt very comfortable when he heard this.

Ye Lan was right.

This phoenix robe should belong to her in the first place!

Could it be that a dead person like ye Zhuo wanted to compete with her?

“”No matter what, I still have to thank you.”Qiu Di held ye Lan’s hand, “Sister Ye Lan, to tell you the truth, you have solved a big problem for me. Miss ye only promised verbally to hand over everything in changyue to me. With this phoenix robe, I can give everyone a better explanation.” ”

“Ye Lan said, “Ye Zhuo is that kind of hypocrite! She deliberately wanted to see you as a joke!” ”

“”No, no, no,”qiu di immediately said, “I believe that Miss Ye is not that kind of person. Although she has hidden something from your background, I believe that there must be other reasons. “No matter what, the dead are already dead. Those of us who are still alive should give her face.” ”

Qiu Di’s words were too beautiful. It made ye Lan feel that Qiu Di was the daughter of an aristocratic family who did not have any heart.

“”What face does a person like her need?”Ye LAN continued, “Oh right, young miss, how is the investigation of my parents coming along?” ”

“The smile on Qiu Di’s face did not change. He continued, “Sister Ye Lan, regarding your background, Skynet is already going through the final procedures. I reckon that the Manxing Kingdom will send people over before the general election.” ”

They would send people over on the day of the election!

“In that case, she would be able to regain her status as the first princess immediately. ”

“Really?”Ye Lan asked in surprise.

“”Yes.”Qiu Di nodded. “Just yesterday, Skynet took a sample of you.” ”

“Ye Lan was so excited that she knelt down to Qiu di. “Eldest miss, you, you are practically my second parent!” ”

“At the end of her sentence, Ye Lan was already sobbing uncontrollably. ”

She was really very excited.

She had thought that she would never be able to find her parents in this lifetime and would never be able to reunite with them again.

It was Qiu di who had helped her!

It was not wrong at all to say that Qiu Di was her second parent.

“Qiu Di immediately walked over and helped Ye Lan Up. “Sister Ye Lan, this is just a simple task. You Don’t have to do this. I believe that if it were anyone else, they would definitely not be able to turn a blind eye.” ”
