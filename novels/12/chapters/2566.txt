“”Then think of two.”Bai Jingshu continued, “One for a boy and one for a girl.” ”

“Ye Zao said, “According to our family’s genes, there shouldn’t be a need to think of a girl’s name.” ”

“The Lin family had always only given birth to boys, not girls. ”

“”That might not be the case.”Bai Jingshu said, “Aren’t you the exception?” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “That’s true.” ”

“Not long after, Ye Shu finished organizing the acupuncture room and sent a message to ye Zao and Bai Jingshu. ”

“Ye Zao put down his phone. “Sister-in-law, let’s go. Mom sent a message over.” ”

“Okay.”Bai Jingshu stood up as well. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Little White appeared out of nowhere. “Da Zao!”

“”Is something the matter, Doggie?”Ye Zhuo turned around. ”

“Little White hesitated for a moment before continuing, “Scorch, I, you, you...” ”

Ye Zhuo narrowed his eyes. “Did you do something bad again?”

“”No, no!”Little White immediately waved his hand. ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Then what’s wrong with you?” ”

“Little White said, “Can I go and see my online friends?” ”

“Little White had become addicted to online chatting recently and had even registered a wechat account. Through a little shake, he had managed to meet quite a few people and had managed to make a particularly good netizen. ”

“Usually, they would chat together and eat chicken together. ”

“Through communicating with little white, he realized that the other party was actually a robot as well! ”

This made little white meet an old friend from another place!

“Meet some netizens?”This answer made ye Zhuo and Bai Jingshu very surprised.

Little White nodded and looked at ye Zao with anticipation.

“Without waiting for ye Zao to answer, little white continued, “Big Zao, I Promise You That I will never be cheated by anyone, and I will never be sold into the mountains!” ”

“Ye Zao continued, “Where are you going to meet him? Do you want me to send him off?” ”

“Little White widened its eyes and was extremely excited. It even changed the way it addressed ye Zao. “Daddy, can you send me off?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Little White said excitedly, “Thank you, daddy!” ”

“Long live burning!”

It wished it could sing a song right now!

“Afraid that ye Zao would go back on his word, little white stuck out its little finger. “Burning, let’s make a pinky swear! Whoever goes back on his word will be a puppy!” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zao made a Pinky swear with it.

Bai Jingshu looked at the two of them and laughed softly.

“After pinching it, little white continued, “We’ll meet tomorrow at 11 am. Can We set off at 10 am?” ”

“Sure.”Ye Zhuo nodded.

“Little White immediately circled around the spot. “Yay, yay, yay! Long live burning!” ”

“Ye Zhuo and Bai Jingshu continued to walk forward. Little White continued, “Burning, what are you guys going to do? Is there anything I can help you with?” ”

“”Go and order milk tea for me.”Ye Zao looked at Bai Jingshu. “Sister-in-law, do you want to drink it?” ”

Bai Jingshu shook her head. “I don’t have an appetite.”

“Little White said, “Then I’ll order two cups!”Bai Jingshu did not drink milk tea, so ye Zao could drink two cups each. ”

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded.

“Soon, they reached the acupuncture room. Ye Shu had prepared everything. Ye Zao let Bai Jingshu lie on the bed. “Sister-in-law, it might be a little painful at the beginning. Bear with it.” ”

“Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded.

Ye Zao took out the acupuncture bag and began to perform acupuncture.

“At first, it did hurt a little, but it soon stopped. It was replaced by a very comfortable feeling, as if her entire body was wrapped by a warm current. ”

“After the acupuncture, Bai Jingshu felt much more relaxed. “Zao Zao, thank you. I feel like I’m reborn now.” ”

“”Sister-in-law, we’re all family!”Ye Zhuoluo said with a smile. ”

“Ye Shu said with a smile, “Yes, yes, yes, we’re all family. Jingshu, do you have a better appetite now? Do you want to eat something?” ”
