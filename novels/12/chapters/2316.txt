“Hearing this, Father Yu was a little speechless and said, “We’re already an old married couple, what kind of surprise do you want?” ”

“”Dad, other than a surprise, there’s also a sense of ceremony. Mom has worked hard for so many years. You know what kind of temper you usually have.”Yu Zifei continued, “Only my mom can tolerate you. If it were anyone else, they would probably have divorced long ago.” ”

“You Little Brat!”Father Yu kicked Yu Zifei.

“”You father and son haven’t come out. What are you talking about in the kitchen?”At this moment, mother Yu’s voice came from the dining room. ”

“Hearing this, father yu immediately replied, “Nothing, nothing. We’ll serve the dishes immediately!” ”

“After saying this, father Yu put away the jewelry box and pretended that nothing had happened. He carried the dishes to the dining room. ”

Yu Zifei followed closely behind.

“There was plenty of time. Yu Zifei cooked five dishes and a soup. Although his cooking skills were not that good, he could still see it. It was not as eye-catching as he had imagined. ”

“Mother Yu smiled and said, “Zifei is really amazing! He actually made so many dishes.” ”

Yu Zifei picked up a drumstick for mother Yu. “Please try the taste of this drumstick.”

“”Okay.”Mother Yu nodded and lowered her head to take a bite. She smiled and said, “Good, it’s very good. It’s much better than what I made!” ”

“Yu Zifei picked up another drumstick for Father Yu. “Dad, you should try it too.” ”

“Father Yu took a bite. His expression was inexplicable. He turned to look at Mother Yu and saw that she was eating happily. He smiled and said, “Your mother is right. This drumstick is not good either. It’s even better than what your mother made!” ”

“”Really?”Yu Zifei felt that it was not easy to get his parents’approval. He continued, “I’ll try one too.” ”

Father Yu immediately blocked Yu Zifei’s chopsticks and smiled. “Of course you have to keep such delicious food for your mother and me. You can eat something else.”

Mother Yu nodded. “It just so happens that your father has been on a diet recently. Let him eat more chicken.”

“Since mother Yu had said so, father Yu could only nod with tears in his eyes. ”

“At the dinner table, they were having a good time. ”

“While they were chatting and laughing, father yu asked curiously, “By the way, zifei, how is the completion of Miss Ye’s Mars Oasis Project coming along? I see that the international news section has been publishing this news for the past few days.” ”

Transforming Mars was not a simple matter.

“As early as ten years ago, country C had used a Mars rover to land on Mars. According to research, Mars was not suitable for human survival. ”

“Ever since ye Zao announced the Oasis Project, there had been a lot of people waiting to see ye Zao and China make a fool of themselves. ” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Yu Zifei was a member of the OASIS project team. As a father and a Chinese, he certainly did not want the oasis project to fail. ”

“After saying that, Yu Zifei’s father continued, “Especially country C, I think they can’t wait to see Miss Ye make a fool of herself. During this period of time, you must be careful not to drop the ball at the most critical moment!” ”

“”En.”Yu Zifei nodded and continued, “I’m not at liberty to reveal the specifics. In short, Miss Ye will definitely not disappoint everyone.” ”

“That’s good.”Father Yu nodded and sighed. “Miss Ye is really amazing!”

“Although he had only met ye Zao once, Father Yu still had a deep impression of ye Zao. ”

“Before ye Zao, Father Yu thought that ye Zao was a middle-aged woman who was even older than him. However, he never expected that not only was ye Zao Young, he was even younger than Yu Zifei. ”

“However, it was this kind of young lady who had actually completed the miracle of an aircraft carrier ascending into the sky and surpassing the speed of light. ”

“Because of this, Dr. YC’s good name was already known to the whole nation. ”

“Not only did ye Zao appear in the history books of the country, but he also appeared in the history books of some foreign countries. ”

“Mother Yu continued, “Is your Miss Ye married now?” ”

“Yu Zifei shook his head. “Not yet, but it should be soon.” ”

“Miss Ye is about to get married. Shouldn’t your matters be put on the agenda?”Mother Yu changed the topic and turned to Yu Zifei.

“Yu Zifei smiled and said, “Alright, I’ll Hold On Tight.” ”

“”You should have held on tight.”Mother Yu continued, “I went to the morning market to see your uncle Lin this morning. Guess what I Saw?” ”

“Yu Zifei said, “His grandson knows how to be a bystander?” ”

“”What do you mean by a bystander? His grandson is already in the first grade!”Mother Yu continued, “Wang Long is the same age as you. Don’t let him become a grandfather and you don’t even know where your son is!” ”

“”Yes, yes, yes. I understand,”Yu Zifei replied. ”

“Mother Yu continued, “Every Time I urge you, you are always like this. You have to remember this in your heart.” ”
