The last time.

“Although Li Hang had made sufficient preparations, he still found it difficult to accept this at this moment. ”

“How could it be...”Li hang directly cried out.

“Come over quickly.”

“After saying this, the medical staff hung up. ”

Li hang quickly ran into the hospital.

He ran all the way to the ICU.

“The Doctor was already waiting at the door. Seeing that Li Hang had come over, he immediately let Li Hang put on the isolation suit. “Quickly go in.” ”

“Okay.”Li hang nodded and walked into the ward.

“Zhou cuihua had already woken up. When she saw Li Hang come in, she smiled and said, “Hang.” ”

“Mom.”Li hang immediately ran over and held Zhou Cuihua’s hand.

“Unlike her dying breath in the morning, Zhou Cuihua’s face was ruddy. There was a smile at the corner of her mouth. She did not look like a person who was about to die at all. ”

“”Doctor, are you mistaken? My mother is in such a good state of mind, how could she...” ”

“The doctor who was following behind sighed. “Theoretically speaking, your mother’s condition is like a flash in the pan.” ”

“This phenomenon was like the setting sun in the west. Although its light would make the sky brighter, it would not last too long and would soon darken. ”

“It was the same for the patient. Before she died, her condition would be much better than before she died. She would suddenly be able to talk and laugh, and she would be able to clearly explain her funeral arrangements. ”

Zhou Cuihua was currently in this state.

“The doctor continued, “If you have anything to say, say it as soon as possible.” ”

Zhou cuihua looked at the doctor. “How much more time do I have?”

“Although the doctor could not bear it, he still had to tell the truth. He could not let the patient leave with regrets. ”

“No more than tomorrow.”

No more than tomorrow.

“When she heard this, Zhou Cuihua’s expression was unclear. ”

“The doctor continued, “I’ll be right outside. If you need anything, you can call me.” ”

“After saying that, the doctor walked out of the door. ”

“After he left, only Zhou Cuihua and Li Hang were left in the ward. ”

“Mom! I Don’t want you to die!”Li Hang threw himself next to Zhou Cuihua and cried out loud.

“Zhou Cuihua didn’t expect things to turn out this way. When she was about to die, she remembered many things from the past. “Hang Hang, Mom has let you down.” ”

“If she hadn’t been jealous of Xia Xiaoman, she wouldn’t have divorced Li Dalong. As long as they didn’t divorce, things wouldn’t have turned out this way. ”

“She was about to die and wouldn’t know anything. However, Li Hang had suffered. ”

“”Mom, don’t say that.” ”

“Zhou cuihua held Li Hang’s hand and continued, “Hang Hang, have you contacted your father?” ”

“I have.”Li hang nodded.

“Zhou cuihua continued, “Then what did he say?” ”

“Li hang cried, “He still said the same thing. It has nothing to do with me anymore. So Mom, you can’t die. You have to live. If you die, what will I do?” ”

“Hearing that, Zhou Cui Hua’s expression instantly became vicious, “It’s said that a tiger doesn’t eat its own son. This Li Da Long! He’s not human! Even if I turn into a malicious ghost, I won’t let him go!” ”

Zhou Cui Hua was very hateful now.

She hated herself but why did she have to run the red light.

“At this moment, Zhou Cui Hua seemed to have thought of something and continued, “Right, Hang Hang, after I die, you have to make the driver responsible! Make them compensate! At least five million!” ”

“I can’t...”Li hang shook his head.

“Why?”Zhou cuihua asked.

“Li hang continued, “The driver who hit you died on the spot. His family is in the countryside and can’t even afford 100,000 yuan, let alone five million.” ”

Zhou Cuihua’s heart thumped.

She originally thought that her death would bring Li hang a sum of money...

She did not expect...

“”So Mom, you have to be strong. You have to help me find my father!”Li hang cried, “You can’t Die!” ”

“If she could not die, who would not want to live? ”

“At this point, Zhou Cuihua was no longer afraid of death. However, she was afraid that after she died, Li Hang would have no one to take care of him. ”

“Zhou cuihua continued, “Call your father now and tell him that I am about to die. You are his only biological daughter. He can not leave you alone!” ”

“No matter what happened, Li Hang was still Li Da Long’s only daughter. Li Da Long had to take care of him. ”

Li hang shook his head. “It’s useless. He’s already blacklisted me.”

“Did you tell him that I’m going to die?”Zhou cuihua asked.

Li hang nodded.

“Hearing this, Zhou Cuihua wished she could stand up and kill Li da long with a knife. ”

He was really inhuman!
