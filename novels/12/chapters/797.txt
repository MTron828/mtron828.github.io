Translator: 549690339

“If Lin Ze continued to stay by Ye Shu’s side, sooner or later, he would be taught a bad lesson by Ye Shu. ”

“In the past, Lin Ze was an excellent student. ”

What about Lin ze now?

“Not only was he an excellent student, he couldn’t even differentiate between good and bad. ”

Feng Xianxian was so good.

Lin Ze just couldn’t see it!

“Lin Ze frowned slightly. “Grandma, I Still Call You Grandma because you raised me since I was young! If you continue like this, sooner or later, people will turn against you!” ”

“”Since you know that I raised you, then you should know that without me, you wouldn’t exist!”Old Mrs. Lin frowned, “Lin Ze! I’m your grandmother! Your Biological Grandmother! When you were born, you weighed only three pounds. I raised you with all my effort. Is this how you repay me now?” ”

Old Mrs. Lin felt her heart turn cold.

This was the grandson that she raised.

She thought that Lin Ze was a filial and good child.

She didn’t expect to raise an ingrate.

“If she had known this would happen, she wouldn’t have raised Lin Ze in the first place. ”

“”I didn’t want to bring it up again,”Lin Ze’s tone was still the same. “Since you brought it up, I’ll repeat it again. If you hadn’t taken me away from my mother, I wouldn’t have been separated from my mother and son for so many years!” ”

“Old Mrs. Lin looked at Lin Ze in disbelief, and her eyes instantly turned red, “Good! Good! I’ve painstakingly raised you. It’s fine if you don’t know how to be grateful, but now you want to turn the tables! Raising You is better than raising a dog! Raising a dog also knows how to wag its tail at people! What about you? What do you know?” ”

“When she brought Lin ze back from Yunjing, Old Mrs. Lin was already sixty-two years old. ”

How could it be easy for a sixty-two-year-old old man to raise a newborn baby?

But How was Lin ze treating her now.

“The more old Mrs. Lin thought about it, the more bitter she felt. ”

It was unbearable.

“Lin Ze’s heart had long since turned cold toward Old Mrs. Lin, he continued, “Grandma, the heavens are good at reincarnation. Who would be spared by the heavens? Right now, you’re stirring up trouble in the family because of a Feng Xianxian! Sooner or later, Karma will find you! Perhaps, Karma is already on its way! When that time comes, it’ll be too late for you to regret it.” ”

Feng Qianhua had done bad things and thought that she could hide it from the world. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“In the end, she still got what she deserved. ”

Lin Ze believed that old Mrs. Lin would see the truth one day!

Inexplicably.

“Lin Ze’s words reminded Old Mrs. Lin of what Feng Xianxian had said, and she felt a chill in her heart. ”

No.

No.

Feng Xianxian definitely wouldn’t treat her like that.

Old Mrs. Lin comforted herself in her heart.

“Lin Ze didn’t want to say anything more, so he turned around and walked toward the dormitory door. ”

“Ah Ze! Don’t even you want to acknowledge me as a grandmother?”Old Mrs. Lin shouted.

Lin Ze walked inside without turning his head back.

Old Mrs. Lin couldn’t help but cry.

Was she really making the wrong choice?

Why couldn’t they accept Feng Xianxian?

“She was the old lady of the Lin family, and she was already in her eighties. She had walked on more bridges than they had walked on. Why couldn’t they understand her? ”

Were they trying to force her to death?

Old Mrs. Lin stood under the dormitory for a long time before she returned to Feng Xianxian’s apartment.

“At five in the evening, Feng Xianxian returned from outside. ”

“The moment she opened the living room door, she saw Old Madam Lin lying on the sofa. ”

Could it be that the medicine had taken effect?

Feng Xianxian narrowed her eyes. “Grandma.”

Old Madam Lin did not react.

Feng Xianxian took another step forward. “Grandma?”

Old Madam Lin still did not react.

“Just as Feng Xianxian heaved a sigh of relief, old madam Lin suddenly opened her eyes and looked at Feng Xianxian. “Xianxian, you’re back?” ”

Still not acting up?

“A glimmer flashed across Feng Xianxian’s eyes, but a smile appeared on her face. She walked over to Old Lady Lin and said, “Grandma, why are you sleeping on the sofa? Let me help you to your room!” ”

Old Lady Lin looked at Feng Xianxian and felt that she had misunderstood Feng Xianxian this morning.

Feng Xianxian was filial and sensible. She would definitely not harm her.

“If Feng Qianqian wanted to harm her, would she still be so concerned about her? ”

A misunderstanding!

It must be a misunderstanding.

“Old Madam Lin smiled and said, “It’s fine. The sofa is fine. I was waiting for you to come home. I didn’t expect to fall asleep while waiting.” ”

“Feng Qianqian helped old madam Lin into the bedroom and said, “Grandma, you can rest in the bedroom for a while. I’ll go and Cook.” ”
