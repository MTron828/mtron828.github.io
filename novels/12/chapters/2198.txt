“Man Wen said calmly, “There are still discussions.” ”

The issue of online voting was very easy to solve.

The problem now was what to do about the live voting later.

“If nothing unexpected happened, in a normal game, the winner would be man Xing. ”

“If it was just now, he still had hope to fight against man Xing, but now, there were so many people standing behind man Xing. ”

He really could not compete with man Xing Bo.

“Thinking of this, man Wen pinched his fingers. ”

“MAN XING also did not expect that man Wen, this good-for-nothing younger brother’s ranking, could actually be on par with his. He looked at man Wen thoughtfully. ”

It was also this glance that made man Xing see a sense of crisis.

It was very strange.

“Could it be that man Wen had really been pretending and hiding his strength all these years, just as she had thought? ”

“If that was really the case, man Wen was too terrifying! ”

How did he do it!

“Master Cao seemed to have seen through man Xing’s thoughts, he said in a low voice, “Xing ‘er, I’ve checked. The person who colluded with Man Wen is upper left Cheng. Those tickets must have been obtained by upper left Cheng’s Help!”Upper left Cheng was an old subordinate that man Jiangshan had placed great importance on, he had more prestige in man Xing country. ”

“However, he was an old subordinate after all. That prestige was only enough to get the tickets. If he wanted to compete with man Xing, he was still far from it! ”

“Hearing this, man Xing narrowed his eyes. “So it’s him.” ”

“Zuo Shangcheng was a very strange person. When he had not abdicated, he had valued man Wen. No matter what man Wen did wrong, he would defend man Wen in front of man Jiangshan. As for a truly outstanding person like her.., zuo Shangcheng did not seem to see it. ”

“Therefore, Manxing did not have a good impression of Zuo Shangcheng. ”

“Master Cao continued, “Therefore, Xing ‘er, don’t be anxious. Sometimes when miss is around, you will definitely be able to successfully ascend to that position.” ”

“Yes.”Manxing nodded. The sense of crisis in her heart dissipated a little.

“Soon, it was time for the live voting. ”

Almost all the important ministers of the Manxing Nation voted for man Xing.

“I support Miss Man Xing.”

“Miss Man Xing.”

“Man Xing...”

“Man Xing stood in front of the stage and bowed politely to everyone. “Thank you, thank you everyone. Please rest assured, I will definitely not disappoint everyone’s expectations.” ”

“There were many people who supported man Wen, but compared to man Xing, they were still far behind. ”

Manxing glanced at Manwen.

“When she took the throne, she would only Test Manwen. ”

To be merciful to the enemy was to be cruel to herself.

She must not give Manwen any chance to turn the tables.

“At this moment, some people who were close to upper left Cheng suddenly voted for Manwen. ”

“With this turn of events, Manwen would soon surpass Manxing. ”

“However, man Xing was not worried at all. ”

She still had Shi Qingcheng’s help.

“Shi Qingcheng was the successor of the Indigo Kingdom. With just one vote, she could throw off a few other people’s votes. ”

“At this moment, Shi Qingcheng stood up from her seat. ”

“Seeing Shi Qingcheng Stand Up, a faint smile appeared on man Xing’s face. ”

“Shi Qingcheng took out the voting device and entered the person’s name. Soon, a mechanical voice sounded, “Indigo Kingdom, Shi Qingcheng Votes for man Wen.” ”

Manwen?

Shi Qingcheng was actually here to support Manwen.

“At this moment, man Xing thought that he was hearing things, and his face turned pale. ”

How did things turn out like this?

Cold Sweat broke out on his back at this moment.

“Before man Xing could react, Leo stood up from his seat. “Zerg, Leo votes for Manwen.” ”

“Seeing Leo vote for Manwen, Manzai Bang was also stunned. ”

Wasn’t Leo here to support him?

Why did he vote for Manwen.

“After Leo stood up, Ye Han also stood up from his seat. ”

“”Changyue country, ye Han votes for Manwen.” ”

“”F galaxy, all members of JY team vote for Manwen.” ”

“”W Galaxy, the Wind Clan votes for Manwen.” ”

“...”

More and more people stood up and voted for Manwen.

“This time, not only Manxing was stunned, but everyone else was also stunned. ”

“No one expected that Shi Qingcheng, Leo, Ye Han, and the others were here to support manwen. ”

Manwen...

It was actually Manwen.

“Even Manwen himself did not expect that until now, he was still in a daze and felt that it was very unreal. ”

“The vice president walked to the front of the stage and said with a smile, “Mr. Manwen’s vote is 588 votes higher than Miss Manxing’s! I now announce that Mr. Manxing will be the 189th President of Manxing Nation.” ”
