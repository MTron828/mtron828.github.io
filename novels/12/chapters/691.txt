Translator: 549690339

What a joke of fate.

Liu Caiyi smiled. “Aren’t you going to invite me to your house for a cup of tea?”

“Feng Xianxian said a little awkwardly, “President Liu, I...” ”

Liu Caiyi reached out and patted Feng Xianxian on the shoulder. “I already know what happened. You’re very strong.”

Liu Caiyi only found out about the sudden change in Feng Xianxian’s life.

That was why she couldn’t wait to look for Feng Xianxian. She didn’t want Feng Xianxian to give up on entering the literary world because of this matter.

She also didn’t want a person who came from behind the scenes to show off in the literary world.

This was unfair to the truly talented people.

Feng Xianxian looked up at Liu Caiyi in surprise.

“Liu caiyi continued, “Miss Feng, all of this was done by your mother. It has nothing to do with you. I believe in your character. I also hope that you won’t be unable to recover from this setback.” ”

“”President Liu, thank you!” ”

“Liu caiyi smiled and said, “Aren’t you going to invite me to Your House for Tea?” ”

Who Was Liu Caiyi?

She was the vice president of the Chinese Arts Association.

“She was also the heir of the Liu family. She definitely could not stand the environment of a rented house. Not to mention Liu Caiyi, if Feng Qianxian was not putting on an act for Old Lady Lin, she would not be able to stand it. ”

“Feng Xianxian continued, “President Liu, there’s a coffee shop nearby. Why Don’t we go for a cup of Coffee?” ”

“Okay.”Liu Caiyi nodded. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The two of them walked towards the coffee shop together.

“Feng Xianxian handed the menu to Liu Caiyi. “President Liu, what would you like to drink?” ”

“Liu Caiyi said, “I’d like a cup of Blue Mountain.” ”

Feng Xianxian looked up at the waiter. “Two cups of Blue Mountain then.”

“”Alright, Please Wait a moment.” ”

“After the coffee was served, Liu Caiyi continued, “What plans does Miss Feng have next?” ”

“Feng Xianxian was stunned for a moment, and a self-deprecating look flashed across her face. “President Liu, what plans can a person like me have in the future?” ”

“”You’re underestimating yourself too much.”Liu Caiyi continued, “In my heart, you’re a person of great talent. I also hope that you can face up to yourself. At the same time, I also hope that you can participate in the assessment competition three months from now.” ”

Assessment competition.

“When she heard these three words, Feng Xianxian’s eyes lit up. “President Liu, can I continue to participate in the assessment competition of the literary world?”Feng Xianxian thought that after such a change in her life, she would never be able to participate in the assessment competition again. ”

She didn’t expect Liu Caiyi to be willing to continue helping her.

This was a pleasant surprise for Feng Xianxian!

“Of course.”Liu Caiyi nodded.

“”Thank you, President Liu!”Feng Xianxian stood up and bowed to Liu Caiyi. ”

“Liu caiyi smiled and said, “It’s just a matter of words. You Don’t have to do this. In the time to come, I hope you can prepare well for the assessment and make everyone’s eyes shine.” ”

Liu Caiyi hoped that Feng Xianxian could crush ye Zhuo.

“After all, Feng Xianxian had almost become master Yu’s disciple. ”

She also wanted Master Yu to regret it.

She wanted everyone in the literary world to know that ye Zhuo had entered through the back door.

“Feng Xianxian continued, “President Liu, don’t worry. I will definitely not let you down.”As a woman, Feng Xianxian could feel that Liu Caiyi also hated ye Zhuo. ”

“If it wasn’t to deal with Ye Zao, Liu Caiyi wouldn’t have helped her over and over again. ”

It was said that the enemy of an enemy was a friend.

“At this moment, Liu Caiyi was a noble to Feng Xianxian! ”

A noble who could help her deal with ye Zao!

“Seeing Feng Xianxian like this, Liu Caiyi nodded in satisfaction and continued, “Miss Feng, shall we add each other on wechat?” ”

“Sure!”

Feng Xianxian also immediately took out her phone.

The two of them added each other on wechat.

...

“The next day, Ye Zhuo and Old Mrs. Cen made an appointment to go shopping for the New Year. ”

“Because she had made an appointment with Ye Zhuo, Old Mrs. Cen got up early. ”

She was wearing a wine-red coat and a wine-red hair clip on her head. She looked very fashionable and exquisite.

“When she came downstairs, Cen Shaoqing was already eating at the dining table. ”

“Grandma.”

“Old Mrs. Cen walked over to Cen Shaoqing’s side, “How is your Grandma’s outfit today? Does it look good?” ”

Cen Shaoqing glanced at Old Mrs. Cen and didn’t comment.

“Old Mrs. Cen saw the disdain in Cen Shaoqing’s eyes and gave him a slap, “You Little Brat, what kind of expression is that? Don’t you know that white-haired Lord Grim never defeats a beauty? Even though I’m old now, when I was young, I was famous for being a great beauty! Do you know what a great beauty is? It’s the kind of beauty that everyone loves, the kind of beauty that only birds would be able to see! The only reason you can grow like this is because you inherited your grandmother’s good genes!” ”
