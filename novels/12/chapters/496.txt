“What’s going on? Hurry up and tell me!”Old Madam Feng said anxiously.

“The Butler raised his head to look at Old Madam Feng, his expression somewhat complicated. “Old Madam, you have to make preparations.” ”

“Hearing this, Old Madam Feng’s heart skipped a beat. ”

“The butler continued, “Family Head Lin suddenly announced the cancellation of the engagement banquet, and now the Lin family is in Chaos!” ”

Cancel the engagement banquet?

“Now that all the guests had arrived, the Lin family wanted to cancel the engagement banquet! ”

How was she going to explain this to the guests present?

“Old Madam Feng’s face turned pale and she stumbled back a few steps. Fortunately, the housekeeper held her in time, “Old Madam, don’t be anxious. There might be some misunderstanding!” ”

“Old madam Feng continued, “Did they say why they wanted to cancel the engagement banquet?” ”

“The Butler shook his head and tried his best to be tactful, “I’m not too sure about the details. I only know that family head Lin’s car was about to arrive, but it suddenly turned back halfway and announced that the engagement party was canceled.” ”

“Old Madam Feng pressed her temples and said weakly, “You go. Go and call the eldest madam over.” ”

The eldest madam was naturally referring to the Feng family’s eldest sister-in-law.

“The butler nodded. “Alright, I’ll go now.” ”

“Soon, Feng Qianhua’s wife arrived. When she heard about this matter, her face turned pale. “How can this be? Isn’t the Lin family bullying others? The engagement was agreed upon today. How can it be canceled so easily?” ”

“Feng Qianhua’s wife was extremely shocked. Although she could not stand Feng Qianhua and her daughter’s petty ways of achieving success, this was a major matter that concerned the entire Feng family. If she could get married to the Lin family, she could also benefit greatly from it. ”

“Now that the Lin family suddenly announced the cancellation of the engagement, how would she and the Feng family behave in the future? ”

“Old Mrs. Feng was completely exhausted and did not want to say another word, “Go and call the second, third, and fourth families. Go and settle the guests down. Tell them that today’s reception was not good and that the engagement banquet has been postponed. I will apologize to them another day.” ”

“Since things had come to this, they could only use the delay as an excuse. ”

“In this circle, besides power, face was also very important! ”

Old Madam Feng only begged the Lin family to temporarily cancel the engagement party. Everything was a misunderstanding.

“Okay.”Feng’s eldest sister-in-law nodded and immediately went to call the other three sisters-in-law.

“These four daughters-in-law of the Feng family, although they usually liked to be calculative, in the face of major events, they were not ambiguous at all. They quickly settled the guests down. ”

“After the guests dispersed, the originally noisy hall instantly became quiet. ”

Feng Qianhua and Feng Xianxian were still upstairs waiting for Lin Jincheng to pick them up.

“Suddenly, the door was pushed open. ”

It must be Lin Jincheng.

Feng Qianhua turned her head in surprise.

But the people who came were the four sisters-in-law of the Feng family.

The smile on Feng Qianhua’s face faded.

“Feng Xianxian said with some dissatisfaction, “First aunt, didn’t you go downstairs to get porridge for me and my mother? Where’s the porridge? and second aunt, third aunt, and fourth aunt, where are the things I asked you to take? Why did you come up empty-handed?” ”

“”It’s already so late, and you still want to eat porridge?”Fourth Sister-in-law’s face was stern. “Don’t talk about porridge! In the future, the two of you won’t even be able to drink water!” ”

“Feng Qianhua frowned. “Fourth sister-in-law, what do you mean by that?” ”

“Third Sister-in-law stood up, her face full of sarcasm. She looked completely different from before. “Don’t you know what I mean? The two of you should stop dreaming about Madam Lin and Miss Lin in the future!” ”

“Hearing this, Feng Qianhua’s heart skipped a beat, and a layer of sweat appeared on her back. “Third sister-in-law, what happened?” ”

“Not to mention Feng Qianhua, when she saw her four aunts acting like this, Feng Qianqian was a little flustered. She subconsciously grabbed Feng Qianhua’s wrist, not daring to be aggressive anymore. ”

Feng Qianhua’s eldest sister-in-law looked at Feng Qianhua. “You really don’t Know?”

Feng Qianhua shook her head.

“”Family head Lin announced that the engagement was canceled,”Feng Qianxian said word by word. ”

What?

The engagement was canceled?

How could this be?

It couldn’t be!

She had just met Lin Jincheng last night and everything was normal in Lin Jincheng. He had even discussed the matter at the engagement party with her. Everything was fine. Why would Lin Jincheng cancel the engagement party just like that?

It wouldn’t happen! Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Lin Jincheng wasn’t that kind of person.

“Feng Qianhua’s face turned pale immediately, but she had no choice but to calm herself down. “Sister-in-law, stop joking.” ”

It was fake.

It was definitely fake.

A few of her family’s sisters-in-law were jealous of her and that was why they were joking with her.
