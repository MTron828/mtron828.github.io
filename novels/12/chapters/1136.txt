Translator: 549690339

Zhao Xueyin looked at the lawyer.

The rest of the higher-ups also looked at the lawyer.

The hard work of the lawyer over the years was seen by everyone.

“If he didn’t have some ability, how could he be the chairman? ”

The lawyer raised his head slowly.

“For a moment, he didn’t know how to speak. ”

“If it was in the past, he would definitely support Zhao Xueyin without hesitation. ”

But now...

“On one hand, it was because ye Zhuo had done him a favor. ”

“On the other hand, he also felt that ye Zhuo’s plan was very excellent. ”

“If it was carried out according to Ye Zhuo’s plan, it would definitely bring considerable benefits to Shunxi Financial Group. ”

“After a moment of hesitation, Si lui raised his head and looked at Zhao Xueyin. “I... I also support President Ye’s plan.” ”

Support Ye Zhuo?

Zhao Xueyin was stunned. Her face turned slightly pale.

She even thought that she was hearing things.

Why would the lawyer support Ye Zhuo?

The lawyer clearly hated ye Zhuo that much.

What was going on?

Could it be... Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Even the lawyer had been tricked by Ye Zhuo?

Scumbag!

Ye Zhuo was a scumbag!

“”Since chairman Si also agrees with President Ye’s proposal, the majority will follow the minority. This matter is settled then!” ”

“I agree with manager Liu’s words!”

“I agree too!”

“Hearing everyone’s words, Zhao Xueyin almost couldn’t react in time. ”

Her questioning gaze swept past the lawyer.

“Meeting Zhao Xueyin’s gaze, the lawyer guiltily lowered his eyelids. ”

Zhao Xueyin must be very disappointed in him right now...

“After a moment, Zhao Xueyin retracted her gaze and said with a smile, “Since that’s the case, then we’ll carry out President Ye’s Plan!” ”

“Hearing this, all the higher-ups nodded in satisfaction. ”

“Zhao Xueyin continued, “If there’s nothing else, the meeting is adjourned.” ”

“After saying this, Zhao Xueyin sorted out the documents before turning around and walking out the door. ”

The Si lawyer looked at Zhao Xueyin’s back and felt extremely uncomfortable.

It wasn’t enough for now.

“After Zhao Xueyin calmed down a little, he would explain to Zhao Xueyin. ”

Zhao Xueyin came to the office and was so angry that she had a headache.

There was a buzzing sound in front of her eyes.

Ye Zao had only returned to the Consortium for a few days?

She had already convinced everyone.

She had even made the lawyer change sides!

What would happen if this went on for a long time?

No.

She could not let ye Zao continue to be so arrogant!

“At this moment, there was a knock on the door. ”

“Her assistant, Annie, turned around. “It’s Miss Jiang.” ”

“Normally, Annie would have let Jiang Xiaoyu in directly. ”

But today was different.

Zhao Xueyin was in a rage.

“When she heard the words ‘Miss Jiang’, Zhao Xueyin’s eyes lit up. “Let her in.” ”

“”Okay.”Annie nodded. “Miss Jiang, Miss Zhao will let you in.” ”

Jiang Xiaoyu walked in.

“Xueyin.”

“Zhao Xueyin stood up. “Xiaoyu, you’re here.” ”

“Jiang Xiaoyu said, “Are you busy now? If you’re not busy, why don’t we go shopping together?” ”

Zhao Xueyin shook her head. “I don’t think so.”

Jiang Xiaoyu looked at Zhao Xueyin. “Why do you look so sad?”

“I’m fine.”

Annie took the opportunity to interrupt. “You’re still mad at President Ye!”

“Miss Ye?”Jiang Xiaoyu was a little puzzled.

“At the same time, she also remembered what ye Zao said. ”

She said that she was just a pawn in Zhao Xueyin’s hands.

Jiang Xiaoyu’s expression didn’t change.

Miss Ye?

Zhao Xueyin furrowed her brows without leaving a trace.

“Just last night, Jiang Xiaoyu was still calling ye Zao and calling him shameless... ”

Why did it change today?

Could it be that even Jiang Xiaoyu changed sides?

“Thinking of this, Zhao Xueyin was extremely flustered. ”

How could this be?

“What happened to Miss Ye?”Jiang Xiaoyu asked.

“Annie continued, “When the morning meeting just started, I don’t know what method president ye used to actually get all the higher-ups of the consortium to support her! Even the chairman of the company was on her side... Miss Kang, what do you think this is It’s our fault that Miss Zhao is too kind to argue with her . . ...” ”

Is this an attempt to fan the flames?

Jiang Xiaoyu bit his lip.

It seems to have been the same last night.

“Under Anne’s fanning the flames, she indiscriminately went to find ye Zhuo’s trouble. ”

I ended up embarrassing myself.

What was this move called?

Killing without spilling blood?

Jiang Xiaoyu’s thoughts went back to many years ago.

“She remembered that when they went to school together, Zhao Xueyin was also like this. She would fan the flames by the ears of people she could not stand. ”

“Jiang Xiaoyu was also someone who could not stand to see her good friend being bullied. Every time, she would stand up for Zhao Xueyin. ”

“In the end, Zhao Xueyin forgave the other party on her behalf with a gentle and generous look. ”
