“Chapter 739: 166: Can Ye Zao do it? Old Lady Lin, who fainted from anger”

Translator: 549690339

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “Although we live with Old Lady Lin, we don’t live in the same courtyard. We don’t usually interact with each other.”In addition, Ye Shu wasn’t the kind of person who would cause trouble, so up until now.., they still got along quite peacefully. ”

...

On the other side.

The Cen family.

“The Cen Old Lady looked at Cen Shaoqing and asked curiously, “I heard that Zhuoluo’s fourth uncle is getting married. Is that true?” ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “It’s true. This is the invitation that fourth uncle gave me.”

“He married Zhuoluo’s classmate’s mother?”The Cen Old Lady continued to ask.

“Yes.”

The Cen Old Lady’s eyes were full of gossip. “Then can that old fool from the Lin family agree? Did she cause a ruckus?”

“Cen Shaoqing had never cared about such trivial matters, and Ye Zhuo was not a chatterbox. At this moment, he shook his head slightly. “I’m not very sure either.” ”

“You’re a sand sculpture! Nothing!”

“”Mom, you might as well ask me instead of him.”Zhou Xiang walked over from the other side. ”

“You know?”Old Mrs. Cen immediately raised her head to look at Zhou Xiang.

Zhou Xiang nodded and smiled. “Have you forgotten that Wenyin and I are good friends?”

“Only then did old Mrs. Cen remember this and hurriedly asked, “Then quickly tell me about it.” ”

Zhou Xiang sat on the sofa and began to talk about the Lin family.

“When she heard that old Mrs. Lin was still objecting to the matter between Lin Qingxuan and Xia Xiaoman, old Mrs. Cen sighed, “The fourth son of the Lin family has a tough life! He actually has such a mother! Other People’s grandsons saved the Milky Way in their previous lives. Did he destroy the Milky Way in his previous life?” ”

Zhou Xiang could not help but laugh.

Cen Shaoqing twirled the prayer beads and felt that he had been offended.

“Old Mrs. Cen looked at Zhou Xiang and gloated, “Do you think that old fool of the Lin family will die of anger if he finds out that Qingxuan and classmate Zhulao’s mother have already gotten married?” ”

“One had to know that Lin Qingxuan was old Mrs. Lin’s most obedient and obedient son. If even Lin Qingxuan did not listen to her and began to disobey her, old Mrs. Lin would probably collapse! ”

Old Lady Cen liked to see Old Lady Lin angry.

Zhou Xiang nodded. “Of course. She will definitely be very angry.”

“Old Lady Cen stood up and said, “Then after the wedding ends tomorrow, I will be the first to inform her!” ”

“”Mom, isn’t this a little bad?”Zhou Xiang asked hesitantly. ” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Old Lady Cen said, “What’s so bad about it!” ”

“In the blink of an eye, the next day arrived. ”

It was the day of Lin Qingxuan’s wedding.

“At half past six, Ye Zhuo came down from upstairs. ”

“Lin Ze held the fat brother Meow in his arms and sat in the dining room, waiting for Ye Zhuo. ”

“Ye Zhuo tilted his head and looked at Lin Ze. “Brother, are you alone at home? Have Mom and Dad gone out already?” ”

“Seeing ye Zhuo come down, brother Meow immediately jumped down from Lin Ze’s arms and ran quickly toward Ye Zhuo. ”

“Brother Meow.”Ye Zao took brother Meow.

“Lin Ze nodded and went to the kitchen to bring out the food. “Zao Zao, Hurry up and eat your breakfast. We’ll be leaving soon.” ”

Lin Jincheng had already left for Lin Qingxuan’s place.

There were still many things to prepare before picking up the bride.

Ye Shu went to accompany Xia Xiaoman.

“Xia Xiaoman didn’t have many friends in Beijing, so ye Shu went to be Xia Xiaoman’s bridesmaid. ”

“Ye Zhuo carried brother Meow in one hand and picked up a sandwich in the other. “Okay, let’s go together in three.” ”

“Three?”Lin Ze raised his head in confusion.

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Cen Shaoqing is already waiting for us outside.”

Cen Shaoqing.

It was Cen Shaoqing again.

“Lin Ze’s expression did not change, but he was a little depressed. Why was Cen Shaoqing everywhere? ”

“After breakfast, the siblings walked out of the door together. ”

“As expected, Cen Shaoqing was standing outside the door waiting for them. ”

“”Brother, Zao Zao.” ”

“Seeing the siblings, Cen Shaoqing smiled and went forward. ”

Brother?

Lin Ze’s eyes lowered.

“He was more than ten years younger than Cen Shaoqing, this old fox, but this old Fox called him ‘brother’very naturally. ”

“If it was an ordinary person, they really wouldn’t be as indifferent as Cen Shaoqing. ”

“Lin Ze continued, “Zhuozhuo, you take his car. I’ll ride there myself.” ”

“Previously, Lin Ze had always called CEN Shaoqing as Cen Wuye. ”

“Ever since Cen Shaoqing and Ye Zhuo got together, Lin Ze had used ‘he’to call Cen Shaoqing. ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Then take care on the road.”

“Okay.”

“After saying that, Lin Ze walked to the parking spot. ”

Ye Zao got into Cen Shaoqing’s car.

“Soon, they arrived at Lin Qingxuan’s new home. ”
