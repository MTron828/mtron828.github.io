Her appearance was somewhat unspeakably cold.

“In a moment, she took out her phone from her pocket and slightly lowered her eyes, as if she was sending a message to someone. ”

“Sun Shu was still lying on the ground, the bones in her body seemed to be broken. It would take a while before she could react. ”

Wait!

Little Slut!

She must teach this little slut a lesson!

Did Ye Zhuo really think that she could be so powerful?

“After coming here, she still wanted to leave unscathed? ”

What a joke!

Sun Yiguo had his own power in the capital. No one could shake him.

“More importantly, Sun Yiguo was her uncle. ”

She had been beaten to such a state by Ye Zhuo. Sun Yiguo would definitely seek justice for her!

“At that time, what faced ye Zhuo would be the most severe punishment. ”

While ye Zao was not paying attention.

“Sun Shu slowly moved into the office desk. There was a security system there. As long as she pressed the button, it would trigger the alarm. At that time, the security guards patrolling downstairs would rush in. ”

In the office on the other side.

“After Sun Yiguo received a call, his expression immediately changed. “Leader! This is a misunderstanding, definitely a misunderstanding! I’m going to investigate right away! Right away! I’ll definitely investigate this matter thoroughly!” ”

“After Sun Yiguo hung up the phone, he immediately went to look for Mr. Zhang. “Zhang Haiyuan, did you bring any new students back from outside today?” ”

“I did.”Zhang Haiyuan nodded.

“What’s her surname?”

Sun Yiguo prayed in his heart that it wasn’t that person.

It definitely wasn’t that person!

“If it was that ancestor, this matter really wouldn’t be able to end! ”

“Zhang Haiyuan said, “Your surname is Ye. What’s the matter?” ”

Ye?

“When he heard that, Sun Yiguo’s face turned pale. ”

It’s over!

It’s all over now!

“Zhang Haiyuan!”Sun Yiguo couldn’t contain his anger. “Who did you provoke? ! You had to provoke that ancestor! It’s over! Now we’re all going to be in trouble!”

“Zhang Haiyuan was a little confused. “CEO Sun, what are you talking about? Isn’t that just a 19-year-old little girl? What trouble can she bring us?” ”

“Sun Yiguo did not have time to explain and continued, “Quickly take me to see Miss ye Now!” ”

Miss Ye?

Zhang Haiyuan actually heard respect from this address.

Did he hear wrongly?

Wasn’t that just a little girl?

What was there to be afraid of?

“”CEO Sun, What’s wrong with you?” ”

“”What’s wrong? !”Sun Yiguo’s face was deathly pale and his entire body was drenched in cold sweat. “Thanks to you, our good days are about to come to an end! Hurry up and take me to see Miss Ye!” ”

Zhang Haiyuan was also frightened by Sun Yiguo like this. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Having known Sun Yiguo for so long, this was the first time he had seen Sun Yiguo so flustered. ”

“Zhang Haiyuan immediately said, “I just brought her to Sun Shu’s office! She should still be in the office at this moment! I’ll bring you there right away!” ”

“Before Zhang Haiyuan could finish his sentence, Sun Yiguo ran out. ”

Zhang Haiyuan hurriedly chased after him.

He was also a little flustered.

“Sun Shu’s office was quite a distance away from here. Sun Yiguo was sweating profusely from running. Just as he reached the office building, he saw a few security guards walking up the corridor with electric shock sticks in their hands. ”

“When they saw Sun Yiguo, they took the initiative to greet him. “Chief Sun!” ”

“Sun Yiguo said, “What are you all doing?” ”

“The leading security guard said, “The Alarm in Madam Sun’s office rang just now.” ”

The alarm rang?

“Sun Yiguo’s heart skipped a beat. “Let’s go, Let’s hurry up!” ”

The group of people ran upstairs.

The office door was closed.

Sun Yiguo didn’t even have time to open the door and kicked it open.

Bang!

Sun Shu saw the people outside the door and her eyes lit up. “Second uncle!”

That’s great!

Sun Yiguo and the others had finally arrived.

“That Little B * Tch, Ye Zhuo, was finished! ”

“When he saw ye Zhuo sitting on the swivel chair, Sun Yiguo’s expression turned even uglier. All the strength in his body was sucked out almost instantly. “M-miss ye!” ”

“You’re Sun Yiguo?”Ye Zhuo turned the phone in his palm.

“Sun Yiguo wiped the sweat off his forehead. “Yes, I am.” ”

“When she saw this scene, Sun Shu was stunned. ”

She almost thought that she was hallucinating.

She originally thought that Sun Yiguo was here to seek justice for her.

But why was Sun Yiguo so respectful to Ye Zhuo?

Was Sun Yiguo Crazy?

“Ye Zhuo continued, “As the founder of female Durban, can you explain to me what is female virtue? Why is it that as long as female virtue doesn’t have male virtue? Is Mr. Sun engaging in sexism? And is this educational institution legal?” ”

The barrage of questions left Sun a little breathless.
