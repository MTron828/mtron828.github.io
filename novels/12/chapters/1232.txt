“OH.”Wang Xinran nodded.

“Lisa, who was at the side, started to stir up trouble. “Then, Xiao Bai, who do you think is the most beautiful lady in Your Heart?” ”

“”Of course, they’re all beautiful!”Xiao Bai said. ”

“What if we have to choose one?”Lisa asked.

“”We have to choose one?”Xiao Bai Thought for a moment and said, “Then I’ll choose burning! Because she’s the most beautiful and powerful great burning!” ”

Everyone was convinced!

Who could find a second girl who was more beautiful than ye Zhuo in the whole consortium?

“Not to mention the Shunxi consortium, even the whole of China could not find a second girl who was more beautiful than ye Zhuo. ”

“Not the chief! The chief is not from the 33rd floor. You have to choose the most beautiful girl in the universe among us!”

“Little White said in distress, “This question is too difficult! Anyway, the burning sun is the most beautiful lady in the universe, the most beautiful lady in the Universe!” ”

Di Di di di —

“At this moment, an urgent voice sounded in the air. ”

“Before everyone could react, little white continued, “I’m sorry, Beautiful Ladies! I Can’t chat with You Anymore!” ”

“Why?”

“Whitey said, “Because my battery is out! I have to go back and recharge the duck!” ”

“Hearing this, everyone had to make way for Whitey to go back and recharge the duck. ”

Whitey immediately ran away.

“Running out of the door in one breath, Whitey looked back into the house. “As expected of me! I’m actually so smart! Those ladies are simply too scary!” ”

“Coming out of the cubicle, Whitey went to look for Brother Meow. ”

“”This silly cat is really too mischievous! It actually played hide-and-seek with me. If I catch it, I’ll beat its little bottom! HMPH!” ”

“From the 33rd floor to the 58th floor, there was still no sign of brother Meow. ”

“Whitey pushed open the door to ye Zao’s office. “Da Zao Zao, I Still Haven’t found the silly cat! What do you think we should do, Duck?” ”

“After saying that, there was no response from the office. ”

Whitey let out a weird ‘eh’sound and looked inside. Only then did it realize that the office was empty and ye Zao was not inside.

“At this moment, the sound of footsteps came from behind. ”

Whitey turned around in surprise.

It must be Big Zao who had brought the silly cat back!

“Big Zao!”

“”The chief went to a meeting?”Allie said with a smile, “Whitey, why are you looking for the Chief?” ”

“It turned out that it was not ye Zhuo who came back with the silly cat. Whitey’s face was full of disappointment as it continued, “Sister Allie, did you see the silly cat?” ”

“”Brother Meow?”Allie continued, “Is brother Meow missing? I just saw him sunbathing at the corner!” ”

“Really?”

“Yes.”Allie nodded.

“Whitey immediately asked, “When is it about?” ”

“Allie thought for a moment and said, “About an hour ago.” ”

“Whitey’s eyes lit up. “Ah! I know! There’s a cardboard box over there. Silly Meow likes to hide there and hide with me! Thank you, Sister Allie!” ”

“Cats liked small, sealed spaces, so they usually kept the express delivery boxes for brother Meow. ”

“You’re welcome.”Ally smiled. “Go and find brother Meow.”

“Okay.”Whitey immediately ran out.

The delivery box was in the corner.

“Whitey walked to the box and squatted down. It let out a mischievous laugh. “Silly meow, I’ve Found You Now! Face the strong wind!” ”

“When it opened the box, Whitey thought it would see a furry fat head. It did not expect the box to be empty. ”

There was nothing!

“Little White thought that it was seeing things. It said in confusion, “How could there be nothing? Did the silly cat hide somewhere else?” ”

Little White was very disappointed that it did not find brother Meow.

Little did it know.

Brother Meow was in an office just a wall away.

This was Zhao Xueyin’s office.

Big Fat Meow was locked inside. It kept scratching the door with its claws.”–”

“What Are You screaming for? !”Zhao Xueyin picked up the copper equipment beside the table and threw it over.

“Although brother Meow was fat, its agility was not any weaker than other meow. ”

It jumped forward and avoided the copper equipment.

Bang!

The copper equipment hit the ground and made a loud sound.

This stupid cat actually dared to dodge!

The B * Tch’s cat was also so cheap!

“Zhao Xueyin’s anger was ignited at this moment, walked over, grabbed brother Meow, and fiercely fell to the ground. ”
