Chapter 117: 078: an unknown past! Brother Ze, your birth mother might be in Yunjing! 3

Ye Zhuo was very clear about the thoughts of people like Qi bin. In the words of this era, he was like the Sea King.

A scumbag who spread his net wide and flirted with girls.

Qi bin did not expect to be rejected by Ye Zhuo.

The Qi family’s family background was not bad, and Qi bin was the only son in the family. He was doted on very much, and his monthly pocket money was above seven figures. He had been wandering around the ladies for so long, and he had always been invincible.

This was the first time he had suffered a setback.

What he had never been able to get was always the best. Not only did ye Zao’s rejection not discourage Qi bin, but it strengthened his desire to win ye Zao over.

He would first win ye Zao over.

When he was tired of playing with him, he would ruthlessly shake him off.

Ye Zao was just a fake daughter of the Mu family.

He had no status, no status, and no backing.

It was ye Zao’s honor to be able to win his pursuit.

Perhaps ye Zao was just jealous. Otherwise, why would she mention Miss Zhao, Miss Wang, and Miss Sun All of a sudden?

Wasn’t this how women behaved when they were jealous?

Yes!

They were definitely jealous.

“Miss Ye, you’ve misunderstood. I’m not familiar with those people at all. Moreover, I’m single now.”Qi bin continued, “Miss Ye, shall we add each other on wechat? If there’s time, let’s have a deep exchange.”

The last sentence was too suggestive.

“Just you?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly, the corners of his mouth curling into a faint smile. “Are you qualified?”

Qi bin frowned. “Don’t Be Shameless!”

There was too big a difference between the physique of a man and a woman. No matter what, a woman would always be at a disadvantage.

It was not as if Qi bin had never forced himself on her.

“You mean you want a one-on-one fight?”Ye Zhuo put down the wine glass, his left hand pinching his right hand. He pinched his knuckles so hard that they made cracking sounds as he looked down at Qi bin.

His eyes were filled with coldness.

His gaze was like looking at a clown.

Qi bin felt that his male dignity had been provoked by ye Zao. No woman had ever dared to talk to him like that! He reached out his hand and tried to hug ye Zao forcefully.

When Ye Zao was still in the Mu family, his reputation was already rotten to the core.

Qi bin did not think that anyone would stand up for ye Zao at this banquet!

Ye Zao gently raised his hand.

Just like that, he grabbed Qi bin’s wrist.

Actually, ye Zao preferred to move his feet rather than move his hands. However, it was a little inconvenient to wear a skirt today.

Bang —

Qi bin felt his entire body suddenly lose its gravity and he fell forward fiercely. He fell to the ground in a sorry state and his four feet were facing the sky.

The commotion over here was too loud and it attracted everyone’s attention.

A grown man actually fell to such a state. He was really too weak!

Ye Zhuo looked at Qi bin with a teasing look in his eyes. His tone was indifferent as he said, “Why is young master Qi so weak like a woman?”

As soon as he said this, the surroundings burst into laughter.

Qi bin lay on the ground, his facial features scrunched up. As the Crown Prince of the Qi group, when had he ever lost such a person?

He did not expect ye Zhuo’s skills to be so good.

Unfortunately, he could only bite off his teeth and swallow his blood.

It was already very embarrassing to begin with. If others were to find out that a grown man like him was actually beaten to such a state by a little girl, where would he put his face?

Qi bin endured the pain and crawled up, quickly escaping the banquet venue.

Ye Zhuo looked at his back and said in a shallow voice, “Young master Qi, be careful of your feet. Don’t fall into mud again!”

Song Shiyu stood at the side and witnessed the entire process. His pair of beautiful peach blossom eyes narrowed, and the depths of his pitch-black eyes were deep and heavy.

In a moment, he walked to ye Zhuo’s side. “Miss Ye.”

“Mr. Song is looking for me?”

Song Shiyu nodded slightly. “Yes.”

“Is something the matter?”

Song Shiyu continued, “Old Mr. Yang is looking for you.”

Ye Zhuo frowned slightly. “You didn’t find the wrong person this time?”

“I made a mistake just now.”Song Shiyu’s tone was gentle. “I hope Miss Ye doesn’t mind.”

Ye Zhuo continued to ask, “The Mr. Yang that Mr. Song mentioned, is that Mr. Yang from the capital?”

“Yes.”Song Shiyu was concise and made a ‘please’gesture. “Miss Ye, this way.” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Ye Zhuo followed closely.

Song Shiyu walked beside her and pointed the way.

After leaving the front hall, they had to walk through an open-air path before they could reach the back hall. It was currently the middle of winter, and although it did not snow in Yunjing, the temperature was still very low.

Song Shiyu instructed the servant to bring a down jacket for ye Zhuo to put on.

“Thank you, Mr. Song,”ye Zhuo continued, “But I’m wearing a suit that can adjust the temperature, so I don’t need to wear a down jacket anymore.”

“ZY technology?”Song Shiyu seemed to recall something.
