“It doesn’t hurt anymore.”Lin Ze shook his head.

“Seeing that Lin Ze was finally willing to speak, old Mrs. Lin was extremely excited. “Ah Ze, are you willing to forgive Grandma?” ”

“Lin Ze’s eyes were slightly red as he said, “Grandma, I’ve never been angry with you. I’m just sad. You’d rather believe in two outsiders than your own grandson. “In the past, I always thought that you were the person who understood me the best in the world!” ”

“Hearing this, Old Mrs. Lin’s heart ached again. ”

“This time, she had hurt the child too badly. ”

She had let the child down!

“Ah Ze! I’m sorry! I’m Sorry!”Old Mrs. Lin hugged Lin Ze in tears. “Grandma promises you that this will never happen again!”

“”Grandma, I also want to say sorry to you,”Lin ze continued, “At that time, I shouldn’t have left so impulsively, causing you to worry for so long!” ”

Old Mrs. Lin liked to hear these flowery words.

“Feng Qianhua and her daughter relied on these words to coax Old Mrs. Lin so much that she could not differentiate between east, south, west, and north. ”

He would definitely make Feng Qianhua and her daughter completely lose their trust in front of Old Mrs. Lin!

Lin Ze secretly clenched his fists.

“Hearing this, Old Mrs. Lin felt even more guilty. ”

“She had misunderstood Lin Ze, but not only did Lin Ze not blame him, he even apologized to her. ”

“”Good girl! I’m sorry! It’s Grandma who has let you down! Ah Ze, go home with Grandma...” ”

Lin Ze nodded.

“Seeing that old Mrs. Lin had personally apologized to Lin Ze, Li Wen, dog two, and fat tiger all heaved a sigh of relief. ”

“At least when Lin Ze went back, he didn’t have to suffer anymore. ”

Old Mrs. Lin said goodbye to Chu Su and left with Lin Ze.

“As soon as they got into the car, Lin Ze suddenly remembered something. “Grandpa Butler, Stop the car.” ”

“What’s Wrong?”

Old Mrs. Lin was also a little puzzled.

Lin Ze opened the car door and walked out. He quickly ran toward the Li family’s villa.

“Li Wen saw him return and asked curiously, “Brother Ze, why are you back?” ”

“”To take the cat,”Lin ze answered. ”

“Fat Tiger said, “Didn’t you say that you don’t have a cat?” ”

“”Take it and throw it away.”As he spoke, Lin Ze had already carried the cat. ”

“”No way! Brother Ze, you’re not going to give it to me even if you want to throw it away?”Fat Tiger especially liked small animals. ”

“You and it are incompatible with each other. It’s better to throw it away.”

Fat Tiger:”...”

“When Lin Ze got into the car again, there was a cat in his hand. ”

“Seeing that Lin Ze was actually carrying a dirty cat, Old Lady Lin frowned and was about to say something, but she swallowed her words. ”

Forget it!

“If the child likes it, then let him go. ”

“They had just gotten into a conflict today, so they couldn’t have any more grudges because of a cat. ”

Brother Meow was very obedient.

He lay in Lin Ze’s arms and didn’t move.

“After a while, the car arrived at the entrance of the Lin family manor. ”

“Lin Ze handed the CAT to the butler. “Grandpa Butler, please get someone to give it a bath. Buy some cat things and send them to my room.” ”

“Okay.”

“The Butler took the cat and asked, “Young master, do you want to keep it?” ”

Lin Ze frowned slightly and turned his head in disgust. “Who wants to keep such an ugly cat?”

“The housekeeper:”...”if you don’t raise it to bathe it and buy things for it, why do you have to send it to your room? ”

“When Aunt Zhang saw that the housekeeper and old Mrs. Lin had brought Lin ze back, she immediately called Feng Qianhua and asked her to get ready. ”

“After Lin Ze returned to his room, Old Mrs. Lin personally delivered some medicine to reduce the swelling. ”

“”Thank you, Grandma.” ”

“Seeing that Lin Ze was really not angry with her, old Mrs. Lin smiled and said, “This silly child, there’s no need to be polite with Grandma!” ”

This child was indeed worthy of being raised by her.

“And now, she was still being intimate with her. ”

“After saying that, old Mrs. Lin continued, “Grandma really didn’t do it on purpose today. When I heard that you actually touched that thing, my heart went blank. I immediately thought of your dead aunt...” ”

“”Grandma, I know.”Lin Ze nodded. “I understand you.” ”

“”Good, good, good child. I have never doted on you for nothing.”Old Mrs. Lin’s eyes were filled with relief. ”

“When they came out of Lin Ze’s room, Old Mrs. Lin asked someone to prepare ginseng soup for Lin Ze. ”

She even specially instructed the kitchen to prepare many of Lin Ze’s favorite desserts.

...

Yun Jing.

The window in the room was open.

“The spring breeze blew past, blowing the white curtains into the wind. The bay window was covered with a thick carpet. On the carpet was a small white table. At this moment, there was a pile of parts on the table. ”

Ye Zao sat cross-legged in front of the table and focused on fiddling with the parts in his hands.

“Zao Zao!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“At this moment, Ye Sen ran in from outside. ”

“”Uncle, what’s Wrong?”Ye Zao raised his eyes slightly. ”

“Ye Sen continued, “The company has a multinational contract to discuss in the afternoon. The other party is a foreigner. Zao Zao, can you go over and translate for Uncle?” ”

Because it involved company secrets.

Ye Sen was worried about finding a translator. He was also a dabbler.

It was also at this time that ye Sen deeply realized how important it was to learn English well.

“What time in the afternoon?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“3:30.”

“Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Okay.”After saying that, ye Zhuo continued, “Uncle, you should also learn English well? If I have something to do in the afternoon, what will you do?” ”

“”Zao Zao, you’re right! From today onwards, I’ll definitely learn English well!”Ye Sen’s gaze fell on the table in front of ye Zao and asked curiously, “Zao Zao, what’s That?” ”

“It’s our house’s sweeping robot. Don’t you recognize it?”Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly.

Sweeping robot?

How did it still look like a sweeping robot?

It was scattered all over the place. It was even worse than being dismembered... It was more like a pile of discarded parts... ...

Ye Sen widened his eyes. “How did you dismantle it like this?”

“Ye Zhuo said calmly, “This robot has too many bugs and too few functions! It can’t do anything other than sweeping the floor, and it’s not even clean! So I took it apart and reassembled it, giving it a big transformation.” ”

“”It’s already been dismantled like this, and it can still be assembled?”Ye Sen suspected that his eldest niece was bragging, but he had no evidence. ”
