Translator: 549690339

“”Chenyu isn’t the kind of person you’re talking about!”Cen Yuyan frowned. “Chenyu is a very good girl. You’ve misunderstood her too deeply! Besides, you don’t have the right to interfere in my social life!””

Song Chenyu wasn’t someone easy to deal with?

The person who was truly not easy to deal with should be ye Zao.

“First, he seduced Lu Xiu, then he blocked her moments.”

She saw that ye Zao was guilty!

She didn’t know why Old Lady Cen would take a fancy to such a person!

Song Chenyu was hundreds of times more outstanding than ye Zao!

“Old Lady Cen looked at Cen Yuyan, she tried her best to be calm and said, “Fourth brother, if you continue like this, sooner or later, you will be at a disadvantage with song Chenyu. At that time, don’t blame me for not reminding you.””

Why did song Chenyu Approach Cen Yuyan?

Wasn’t it because Cen Yuyan was Cen Shaoqing’s fourth sister?

“If Cen Yuyan was just Cen Yuyan, Song Chenyu would still bother with Cen Yuyan.”

“However, Cen Yuyan was still like a fool, unaware of being used by others.”

It was said that only old people would be muddle-headed.

“Cen Yuyan was only in her thirties this year, how could she be muddle-headed?”

Old Madam Cen was very puzzled.

“”Grandma, don’t worry, this kind of thing will never happen! Chenyu is my best friend. I understand her character and believe in her.”In Cen Yuyan’s eyes, song Chenyu was the most outstanding person in the world, so she couldn’t plot against others.”

“Moreover, she and song Chenyu were best friends.”

How could song Chenyu scheme against her!

“Old Mrs. Cen nodded. “Alright, as a grandmother, my responsibilities have been fulfilled. Whether you listen or not is up to you.”Cen Yuyan was already in her thirties this year. She couldn’t force her.”

“Being scolded by Old Mrs. Cen for no reason, Cen Yuyan felt very uncomfortable in her heart. She continued, “If there’s nothing else, I’ll leave First!””

Old Mrs. Cen waved her hand.

Cen Yuyan walked out. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Cen Yuyan had just arrived at the room when she picked up her phone to call song Chenyu and complain to Song Chenyu about Old Mrs. Cen.

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “Old people talk too much, and old trees have too many roots. Yuyan, don’t be angry with old Mrs. Cen.””

“Cen Yuyan didn’t expect that even though Old Mrs. Cen was slandering song Chenyu, song Chenyu could still speak up for old Mrs. Cen. “Chenyu, aren’t you angry at all?””

“Song Chenyu said, “What’s there to be angry about? No one is perfect. Even though I’m a celebrity, I can’t make everyone like me. Furthermore, old madam still has a misunderstanding about me. There’s no need for me to be angry with her.””

“Cen Yuyan sighed. “Chenyu, you’re too Buddhist!”It was obviously a big matter, but in song Chenyu’s eyes, it was like a small matter.”

“Song Chenyu continued, “Alright, go to bed early. You still have to go to the nursing home with me tomorrow.””

“Thinking that she would be able to see Lu Xiu tomorrow, Cen Yuyan immediately smiled. “Then you go to bed early too.””

“”Alright, good night.””

“”Good night, Chenyu.””

“After hanging up, song Chenyu’s expression immediately darkened.”

“Although she knew that old Madam Cen didn’t like her, she didn’t expect that old Madam Cen would have such a deep opinion of her.”

“At this moment, her phone rang again.”

Song Chenyu picked up the call. “Hello.”

“It’s me.”Lu Xiu’s voice came from the other end of the line.

“What’s wrong with Lu Xiu?”

“Lu Xiu continued, “I’m downstairs at Your House.””

Downstairs?

Song Chenyu frowned and immediately went to the window. She lifted the curtains and took a look.

“As expected, Lu Xiu was standing downstairs.”

“What’s the matter?”Song Chenyu asked.

“Lu Xiu raised his head and looked at song Chenyu’s window. “Chenyu, can you come down? I have something to tell you.””

“Song Chenyu narrowed her eyes and continued, “It might be a little inconvenient for me to come down now. Let’s talk about it tomorrow when we meet!””

She naturally knew what Lu Xiu wanted to say to her.

“However, she did not like Lu Xiu at all. The person she wanted to marry was Cen Shaoqing, so she would not go down.”

“Lu Xiu looked at song Chenyu’s window and continued, “I have something very important to say to you...””

“Song Chenyu directly interrupted Lu Xiu’s words. “Oh Right, Lu Xiu, I’ve even arranged for Yuyan to go to the nursing home tomorrow. Yuyan is my best friend. I don’t want to see her sad and sad.””

“”Chenyu, you know what I’m thinking.””

“Song Chenyu sighed. “But I don’t want to see Yuyan Sad and sad, and I don’t want to lose Yuyan as a friend because of me. Lu Xiu, if you care about me, don’t say such things in the future.””
