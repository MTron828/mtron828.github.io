“”You’ll be fine!”Ye Langhua held Old Lady Lin’s hand. “Believe me, don’t think so much. You haven’t seen Ah Ze and Zao Zao form a family yet!” ”

“Although Old Lady Lin couldn’t walk now, she looked pretty good. She didn’t look like she was about to die. ”

“Old Lady Lin continued, “I also want to see Ah Ze and Zao Zao form a family, but I know that I can’t wait until that day. Last night, I dreamt of his father in Jin city. He said that he would come and pick me up in a few days. He said that it would be very lively there.” ”

“Ye langhua comforted her, “Dreams are reversed. You will definitely be fine.” ”

“”Langhua, I’m not afraid of death now. Really.”Old Lady Lin looked at ye Langhua and said very seriously, “Not only am I not afraid of death, I’m actually looking forward to the arrival of death. It’s just that...” ”

“At this point, Old Lady Lin’s emotions suddenly broke down. She cried, “It’s just that I don’t have the face to see the children’s father!” ”

She really didn’t have the face to see him.

“Ye Langhua comforted old lady lin softly, “You’ve already made a change now. I believe that brother-in-law will definitely forgive you.” ”

“But even I can’t forgive myself. I’ve committed so many mistakes!”

Ye Langhua sighed.

“After crying for a while, Old Lady Lin’s emotions slowly improved. She looked at ye Langhua, then, she said, “Langhua, after I leave, please say something to Jiaojiao on my behalf. Say that I’ve let her down. I’m not a good grandmother. If there’s a next life, I’ll definitely make it up to her! And Ah Ze...” ”

Ye Langhua patted Old Lady Lin’s shoulder. “Didn’t I say it just now? Let bygones be bygones.”

“Old Lady Lin took out another small box. “Langhua, I left this small box for burning. After I leave, you must hand it over to burning.” ”

“Ye Langhua did not reach out to take it. “Elder sister, you’ll be fine. Besides, it’s best that you hand it over to burning.” ”

“”No, it’s best that you hand it over to her.”Old Lady Lin stuffed the box into ye Langhua’s hand. “Langhua, I’ll only be at ease if you hand it over to burning.” ”

“Speaking up to this point, old lady lin continued, “Langhua, how good would it be if I could start over in this life!” ”

“If she could start over in this life, she would definitely make up for all her previous mistakes. ”

“Ye Langhua did not say anything. How could she not want to start over in this life? If she could start over, she would definitely not lose her daughter and would not let ye Shu suffer so much. ”

It was a pity.

Life would never start over.

She chatted with Old Lady Lin until midnight before she got up and went back.

“Ye Shu saw that ye Langhua did not come back and was a little anxious, so she came over to look for her. The mother and daughter just happened to meet at the door of the north wing. ”

“Mother.”

“Ah Shu.”Ye Langhua raised her head to look at Ye Shu. She thought of Old Lady Lin’s words and felt a lot.

“Ye Shu held ye Langhua’s hand and said with concern, “Mom, why did you stay until now? Is it Grandma Ah Ze...”she was afraid that Old Lady Lin would make things difficult for ye Langhua. ”

“Ye langhua smiled and said, “Don’t worry, she didn’t make things difficult for me. She just told me some things from the bottom of her heart.” ”

“That’s good.”Ye Shu nodded. “I see that Grandma Ah Ze has also changed a lot in the past two years.”

“Ye langhua continued, “Ah Shu, the past is already in the past. I see that Grandma Ah Ze doesn’t have many days left, especially after what she said to me tonight. try to visit her more often in the future. “Life is actually just a dream. After waking up from a dream, there is nothing. Take advantage of the fact that she is now a child. Try to treat her as well as you can.” ”

There was only one life. One was born to be a person. The most important thing was not to leave any regrets in life.

One had to forgive and forget.

“”Yes.”Ye Shu said, “I was indeed a little unhappy two years ago, but now I can’t be bothered with those things in the past. Now, as long as there is a family meeting or other festivals, I will invite her over.” ”

“”Yes, that’s how a person should be.”Ye Langhua was very supportive of Ye Shu’s actions. ”

“In the blink of an eye, the third day arrived. ”

Today was the day Lin Ze brought his girlfriend home.

“Early in the morning, Ye Shu got up and got busy. She cleaned the house and instructed the kitchen to prepare some dishes. ”

Lin Jincheng also changed into a new set of clothes.

“After all, today was the day to welcome the new members of the family. ”

“As a father, Lin Jincheng knew Lin ze very well. He knew that Lin Ze was sincere. Otherwise, Lin Ze would never bring his wife home in such a big way. ”
