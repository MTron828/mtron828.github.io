Translator: 549690339

Ye Zao stretched out his hand and pinched his waist. “May I ask a certain someone if your internship has ended? is that all you can think about?”

Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads. “Then can we discuss this issue after my internship ends?”

“Ye Zao said, “We’ll talk about it after your internship.” ”

“”Zao Zao, what are the two of you whispering about?”Lin Ze walked over from outside. ”

“Seeing Lin Ze, CEN Shaoqing immediately let go of the hand around ye Zao’s waist. “Brother.” ”

“As long as he saw Lin Ze, CEN Shaoqing would repent once. ”

He shouldn’t have treated his younger brother-in-law that way back then.

His younger brother-in-law’s memory was also top-notch. He could actually remember things until he was three years old!

“Lin Ze glanced at CEN Shaoqing. His eyes clearly said, “Don’t bully my sister.”. ”

“At this moment, an Lizi came over with a bowl of soup. “Mom, did you ask the Doctor If You Can Eat Now?” ”

“”Not yet.”A c-section was different from a natural birth. A natural birth could be done while eating. However, one could not eat for more than ten hours before a c-section. Most importantly, one could not eat immediately after the surgery, one had to wait until the woman was well-ventilated. ”

“Before the woman was well-ventilated, she could not eat anything and could only drink a little water. ”

“Hearing this, Lin Qingxuan frowned and said, “You haven’t eaten since nine o’clock last night. It’s already past four o’clock in the afternoon! Why Don’t you eat a little first? How Can You Be Hungry? It shouldn’t be a problem to just eat a little, right?” ”

“Ye Zhuo turned to look at Xia Xiaoman and asked, “Fourth aunt, have you not breathed yet?” ”

“Not yet.”Xia Xiaoman shook her head.

“Ye Zhuo thought for a moment and took out a small bottle of pills from his pocket. “Then you should take one of these pills first. You can eat after you finish it.”The body of a parturient woman was already quite weak, so it was not good for her to be hungry all the time, it would ruin her body. ”

“Can you breathe after you finish this?”Xia Xiaoman asked.

“”Yes, I can breathe after I finish this.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. ”

Xia Xiaoman trusted ye Zhuo’s medical skills very much and immediately swallowed the pill.

The fragrant taste with a slight astringency was not that difficult to swallow. It was a little different from ordinary pills.

“It was not known whether it was because of the psychological effect or because of the medicinal effect. As soon as she swallowed the pill, she felt a lot better in her stomach. ”

The pain on the edge of the knife also gradually lessened.

“Everything was like an illusion. It was so unreal, but the changes in her body were real. ”

“Xia Xiaoman looked at ye Zao in surprise. “Zao Zao, what kind of medicine is this? The effect is too good!” ”

“”This is a multi-functional medicine.”It was already ranked in the top three on the pharmaceutical ranking list. Because the manufacturing process was quite complicated, Ye Zao was too lazy to do it, therefore, it was now a priceless existence on the list of medicines. ”

“If other people knew that ye Zao used MC pills to vent the air of the parturient woman, they would probably die of anger! ”

One had to know that this kind of MC multi-functional medicine could be used for life-saving purposes at critical moments. This was also why many rich people spent a lot of money to buy one.

“”I see.”Xia Xiaoman nodded. “Zha Zha, you’re really amazing. You know everything.”In Xia Xiaoman’s opinion, there was nothing in this world that Ye Zha didn’t know, ye Zha was almost an all-rounded existence. ”

“Just so-so.”Ye Zha gestured with his hand. “I only know a little bit.”

“Hearing this, an Lizi looked at ye Zao in surprise. ”

A Little Bit?

Are you sure it’s not a hundred million?

“If ye Zao is a little bit, then what is she? ”

Dog Shit?

Trash?

This damn Versailles literature.

“Lin Qingxuan looked at ye Zao. “Zao Zao, is your fourth aunt able to eat now?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Are you sure?”Lin Qingxuan was a little worried about Xia Xiaoman. “Should we get a doctor to take a look?”

“”No Need,”Xia Xiaoman said, “Just listen to burning. I’m hungry and want to drink some chicken soup first.” ” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Lin Qingxuan immediately picked up the chicken soup and fed it to Xia Xiaoman.

...

“After leaving the hospital, Cen Shaoqing took ye Zhuo to the pedestrian street. ”

She had an appointment with Lin Sha to go shopping together.

“Ye Zhuo went shopping with Lin Sha, but Cen Shaoqing couldn’t follow her. “I’ll go back to the company first. You can call me in advance when you’re done.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Cen Shaoqing drove away. At the same time, Lin Shasha walked over from the other side. “Zhuo Zhuo.” ”
