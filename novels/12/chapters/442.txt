Ye Zao couldn’t afford sunscreen.

“In these fifteen days, no matter how beautiful a person was, they would still be tanned. ”

“The latest campus Belle would only be selected after the military training ended. At that time, the tanned ye Zao was destined to be her foil. ”

“Thinking of this, Feng Xianxian curled her lips. ”

“”Xianxian,”Bai Xiaoman finished her makeup and looked at Feng Xianxian. “Are you ready? Are We leaving?” ”

They gathered at the sports field at eight o’clock. It was already half past seven.

“”I still have lipstick to put on,”Feng Xianxian said. ”

“Bai Xiaoman said eagerly, “Let me help you put on lipstick! I see that your makeup today is very light. It’s very suitable for lip-biting makeup.” ”

“Okay.”Feng Xianxian nodded.

“If someone was willing to be her maid, she would definitely be more than happy to do so. ”

“Bai Xiaoman was also very honored to be able to put on lipstick for Feng Xianxian. After all, Feng Xianxian was very generous! ”

“Li Yueyue looked at ye Zao and said in a low voice, “Let’s go first.” ”

Ye Zao nodded slightly.

The two of them walked in the direction of the sports field.

Beijing University had a total of three sports fields.

“Li Yueyue and ye Zao were both in class three, so the military training was also held together. ”

“Li Yueyue’s memory was not very good. “Ye Zao, which sports field are we training on again?” ”

“”Western training,”ye Zao answered. ”

The two of them walked towards the western sports field together.

“At this moment, there were already many students gathered on the sports field. ”

“Ye Zao was wearing a camouflage uniform in a well-behaved manner. Unlike the other girls, he did not deliberately dress himself up. He had a hat on his head, and the wide brim of the hat covered most of his face. Only a part of his fair chin was left, she also had red lips that were burning like fire. ”

“Although her face could not be seen clearly, her valiant and valiant aura was something that others could not replicate. ”

Very few people could dress up so nicely in a wide camouflage uniform.

“As they watched her walk towards the chemistry department, the group of boys on the field exploded. ”

“F * ck! This girl is from our Pharmaceutical Chemistry Department?”

“Did the person from northern film next door run to the wrong set?” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Dog two nudged Lin Ze’s waist. “Brother Ze, look at the pretty girl!” ”

“Although the two of them weren’t in the same dorm, they had chosen the same major, so they were very lucky to be assigned to the same class. ”

“Lin Ze raised his eyelids, and a valiant figure walked past the front of the group. If she wasn’t wearing a student’s camouflage uniform, people would believe that she was a female instructor. ”

“”I’m not interested,”Lin ze said faintly. ”

“Dog Two looked at Lin Ze. “No Way, brother Ze! It’s already university, and you’re still so resistant to girls?” ”

“”Troublesome.”From Lin Ze’s point of view, girls were especially troublesome. ”

“Dog two continued, “What if your father finds your mother and gives birth to a younger sister for you? What will you do?” ”

“”No,”Lin ze answered coldly. ”

“”When the younger sister is born, do you think you can throw it away?”Buttface continued, “Brother Ze, do you think you will become a sister-spoiling maniac?” ”

Buttface was very curious about what Lin Ze looked like when he became a sister-spoiling maniac.

“Lin Ze tilted his head and said coldly, “What are you thinking about?” ”

“Because of Feng Xianxian, he had hated girls since he was young. How could he become a sister-spoiling maniac? ”

Unless it was raining red!

“Buttface patted Lin Ze’s shoulder, “Actually, not all girls are like Feng Xianxian. Brother Ze, you have to try to let go of the knot in your heart! Just that girl just now, I keep feeling that she’s a bit like the main character of the incident that caused a sensation in the female dormitory building last night.” ”

It couldn’t be said that she was a bit like him.

“In any case, she was a lot like him! ”

“What female dormitory building?”

“Dog two began to explain to Lin Ze what had happened last night, “A total of four professors, and the presidents of two academies appeared together in the female dormitory building last night! Now, the forum was in an uproar. Everyone was very curious about the background of this new student! However, the photo on the forum wasn’t very clear, and I don’t know if this is the same person.” ”

Lin Ze didn’t continue.

He had never been interested in topics related to women.

Ye Zhuo and Li Yueyue walked into the line of class three.

The male-female ratio in class three was more even.

“The girls stood at the front of the line while the boys stood at the back. However, because the instructor hadn’t arrived yet, everyone stood together in a mess and talked about their own matters. ”

When they saw ye Zhuo walk over.

Everyone immediately started discussing.

“Dafa! She’s actually from our Class!”

“Pay attention and listen to what her name is later.”

Only when the instructor arrived did the crowd quieten down.

“The instructor was tall and burly, very handsome. The moment he appeared, the girls started screaming. ”
