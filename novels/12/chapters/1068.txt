“Is it really elder Zhang?”Cao Wei was also very incredulous.

“It’s true!”

“Then I’ll make the arrangements right away.”

On the other side.

Zhao Xueyin was sitting in front of the computer desk looking at the stock market situation.

“At this moment, there was a knock on the door. ”

“Come in.”

“The next second, the person outside pushed open the door. Zhao Xueyin looked up and saw Si lui walking in from the outside. Behind him was a handsome young hunk who walked to the middle school campus, the kind that could make all the students scream. ”

“Big Brother Si.”Zhao Xueyin stood up from her chair. “Little Zhang.”

“Little Zhang smiled and greeted, “Sister Xueyin, I heard from Big Brother Si that you have something to tell me personally.” ”

“Yes.”Zhao Xueyin nodded slightly. “You guys take a seat first. I’ll go pour some tea.”

“Si lui was about to say that there was no need to trouble her, but Zhao Xueyin had already walked over to make tea. ”

“In a flash, Zhao Xueyin brought the tea over to the two of them. ”

“Little Zhang took a sip of the tea. “Sister Xueyin, I’ve already drunk this tea. Now, you can at least tell me why you called me over, right?” ”

“It’s a good thing.”Zhao Xueyin smiled.

“What Good Thing?”Little Zhang asked.

“Zhao Xueyin continued, “I’ll introduce you to a girlfriend first.” ”

“Little Zhang said, “Sister Xueyin, I appreciate your kindness, but I already have a girlfriend now.” ”

“”Are you sure you don’t want it?”Zhao Xueyin continued, “The girlfriend I’m introducing you to is very beautiful. She can be said to be peerless in the world.” ”

“”Really?”Zhang Peng was born well. When he was in school, there were already a lot of girls lining up to chase after him. He could be considered to have seen countless women. What kind of beauty had he not seen before? ”

But he had never seen a beauty in the human world.

Especially when the word “Beauty in the human world”came out of Zhao Xueyin’s mouth.

“After all, Zhao Xueyin was a great beauty herself. ”

How beautiful was a person who could make Zhao Xueyin say that she was a beauty in the human world?

“Zhao xueyin smiled and said, “Little Zhang, when did I lie to You?” ”

“”Sister Xueyin, are you serious?”Zhang Peng was in disbelief. ”

“Zhao Xueyin nodded. “If I wasn’t serious, I wouldn’t have asked Big Brother Si to call you here! If you don’t believe me, Big Brother Si can also testify that he knows that girl.” ”

“Zhang Peng turned to look at Si Lui, who nodded seriously. “Your sister Xueyin didn’t lie to you! The other party is indeed extremely beautiful, but I can’t guarantee that you’ll be able to woo her!” ”

“As soon as he said that, Zhang Peng immediately patted his chest and said, “Big Brother Si, look at what you’re saying. When have I, Zhang Peng, ever failed to get a girl? Not only did I not fail, but I could even make the other party chase me!” ”

“Really?”Si Lu pretended to not believe him.

“”Of course it’s true!”Zhang Peng continued, “But the premise is that the other party is really as beautiful as you say, or else it won’t work!” ”

“Don’t worry.”Si lui patted Zhang Peng’s shoulder.

Si Lui and Zhao Xueyin chose Zhang Peng because Zhang Peng had an exquisite face.

“Back then, ye Langhua was trapped by love and didn’t hesitate to chase after Mu Wen. ”

The current ye Zhuo would definitely not be better than the ye Langhua of the past!

“In the blink of an eye, it was the second day. ”

Ye Zhuo arrived at Hibiscus moonlight as promised. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“She had always been a punctual person. She would not arrive early or late. At 11:30 am, she appeared at the door of Hibiscus moonlight on time. ”

Zhao Xueyin looked at the door and immediately sat up straight. “She’s Here!”

“Which one is ye Zhuo?”Zhang Peng narrowed his eyes. “The one wearing white clothes?”

“Zhao Xueyin nodded. “Yes, that’s her.” ”

“Zhang Peng’s eyes were filled with disgust. “No Way, Sister Xueyin! How can she be called a peerless beauty just like that?”He even wondered if Zhao Xueyin was blind! ”

“Not only was the girl they were walking towards right now extremely tanned, she was also fat and ugly, and she was big and burly! ”

How could she be considered a peerless beauty in the world?

“”Ye Zao, this way.”Zhao Xueyin waved at ye Zao. ”

“At this moment, a slender figure walked out from behind the girl in front of her. ”

“If one had to describe her in a poem, it would be: ”

“Only the peony was truly a national beauty. When the flowers bloomed, they would move the capital. ”

“After seeing her appearance clearly, Zhang Peng was stunned. ”
