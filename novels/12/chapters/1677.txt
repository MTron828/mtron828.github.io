Translator: 549690339

“”If Dr. YC really comes to Yunjing, I’m afraid the whole airport will be closed down! How can we even get close to the airport?” ”

Ning Lan felt that Zou Feifei’s words made sense.

“When a big shot like Dr. YC came, even the main roads of Yunjing city would be closed down, let alone the airport! ”

On the other side.

Ye Zao and Lin Shasha arrived at the Lin family home.

“Zhou Yuelian had already prepared dinner at home. Before she even entered the house, a fragrant smell assailed her nostrils, causing people to salivate. ”

Lin Shasha stood in front of the door and rang the doorbell.

“Soon, the door opened. ”

The person who opened the door was Zhou Yuelian.

“Ye Zao called out politely, “Aunt Lian, long time no see!” ”

“”Zao Zao Zao is here. Come in quickly, come in quickly!” ”

“Seeing ye Zao holding all kinds of things in his hands.., zhou yuelian scolded, “Zao Zao, you are such a child. How many times have I told you? Coming here is like coming to your own home. You Don’t have to bring anything!”! Why did you buy so many things? And you, Sasha! Why didn’t you stop Zao Zao from buying things? What a waste of money!” ” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Lin Shasha felt wronged. “Searing had people buy these things in advance and send them over! I couldn’t stop them even if I wanted to!”

“Zhou Yuelian turned to look at ye Zao and said, “Searing, if you come to buy things again next time, Aunt Lian won’t Welcome You!” ”

“Ye Zao held Zhou Yuelian’s arm and said with a smile, “Okay, Aunt Lian, I promise you that if you come again next time, you definitely won’t bring anything.” ”

“Zhou Yuelian smiled and said, “I shouldn’t have brought anything! Aunt Lian is very happy that you’re here! By the way, are your parents busy recently?” ”

“”They’re alright. They’ve always been like that,”ye Zao said ”

Zhou Yuelian nodded. “Then what about your brother? He’s not busy now. Why didn’t your brother come over to play?”

“”My Brother went to the C continent with his friends,”ye Zao said. ”

“I see. What about your uncle?”

“Ye Zao said, “My uncle is still the same. He runs both the company and the family every day.” ”

“Zhou Yuelian seemed to suddenly remember something and continued, “By the way, does your uncle have a girlfriend?” ”

Ye Zao shook his head. “I’m not sure either. I didn’t hear him say that he probably doesn’t have a girlfriend.”

“Lin Shasha saw through Zhou Yuelian’s meaning and said somewhat speechlessly, “Mom, you’re not thinking of being a matchmaker again, are you?” ”

“Zhou Yuelian had recently fallen in love with being a matchmaker. In half a year, she had already made two good marriages. ”

“Looking at the great marriage that she had personally made possible, Zhou Yuelian was filled with a sense of accomplishment. Whenever she saw an unmarried man or woman, she would want to set them up. ”

“”It’s none of your business.”Zhou Yuelian turned to look at ye Zao. “Zao, help me ask your uncle. If he hasn’t found a girlfriend, I really do have a good marriage.” ”

Ye Zao took out his phone. “Then I’ll ask my mom.”

“As an elder sister, Ye Shu had always been very worried about ye Sen’s marriage. She couldn’t wait for Ye Sen to get married and have children so that she could become an aunt! ”

“Unfortunately, ever since Bai Wei’s incident, Ye Sen had never found a girlfriend. ”

“Seeing that he was about to turn 40, how could ye Shu not be anxious? ”

“Other people were already over 40 years old, but ye Sen didn’t even have a girlfriend at 40. ”

“Zhou Yuelian nodded. “Okay, ask around.”. ”

Ye Zho sent a wechat message to Ye Shu.

Zhou Yuelian quickly went to pour water for ye Zho.

“”Mom, wait a minute.”Lin Sha ran over. ”

“What’s Wrong?”Zhou Yuelian turned to look at Lin Sha.

“Lin Sha continued, “Where’s the black tea I bought last time?” ”

“”It’s in the cabinet,”Zhou Yuelian said. ”

“Lin Shasha took out the black tea from the cabinet. “I’ll make a cup of black tea for searing! Mom, take out the pearls and defrost them.” ”

“Okay.”Zhou Yuelian nodded.

“Because all the ingredients were ready-made, it was not complicated to make the black tea. Ten minutes later, Lin Shasha came to the living room with the milk tea. “Searing, try it.” ”

“There was ice in the milk tea. It was cool and delicious, sweet but not greasy. The taste was very good. ”

“”It’s very good,”ye Zha said. ”

“Lin Sha was a little surprised to get ye Zha’s approval. Ye Zha was a big foodie, especially one who liked sweet things. It was a little difficult to get her approval. She smiled and said, “Really?” ”

“Yes.”

“At that moment, Zhou Yuelian walked out from inside. “Zao Zao, have you asked Your Mother?” ”

“”Yes, my mother said that my uncle is still single,”ye Zao said. ”

“Zhou Yuelian smiled and said, “Then maybe it will work. Zao Zao, let me tell you.”. The woman was a doctor. She had graduated from graduate school and worked at the first People’s Hospital in Yunjing City. Now, she had been transferred to the capital. Anyway, she was quite good and often went to various universities to give lectures! The most important thing was that the little girl had a good mind and a correct outlook on life! “Don’t young people nowadays talk about a correct outlook on life? “There is absolutely nothing wrong with the little girl’s outlook on life. The most important thing is that her family doesn’t have any burdens and she doesn’t have any troublesome relatives. She only has an elder sister. You Don’t have to worry about her being some kind of brother-supporting devil. Moreover, her parents are very kind. The little girl is an old child. Her parents are almost ninety years old. Right now, they are hoping that this little girl will have a good home.” ”
