“Old Lady Lin did not have time to think too much and nodded. “Okay, okay! Then let’s go quickly!” ”

Ye Zhuo pushed Old Lady Lin out of the door.

“Just as they reached the door, they saw Lin ze come in from outside. “Grandma.” ”

“Ah Ze is here.”

Ye Zhuo looked up slightly. “Are dad and uncle back?”

Lin Ze nodded. “Dad is already back! Uncle is still on the way. He should be arriving soon.”

“OH.”

The siblings pushed Old Lady Lin towards the east courtyard.

Lin Jincheng was standing in the courtyard chatting with Ye Shu.

“The couple was chatting about something as they wore smiles on their faces, especially ye Shu, who almost bent over with a smile. ”

“”Alright, Alright, stop smiling!”Lin Jincheng reached out and patted ye Shu’s back. “Look, I’m not smiling anymore!” ”

“Ye Shu stopped laughing and continued, “I don’t know what these two kids are up to! I asked them, but they didn’t say anything. They insisted on waiting for you to come back!” ”

Lin Jincheng raised his head and looked outside the door. “They’re here.”

Ye Shu turned around and indeed saw ye Zhuo and Lin Ze walking over. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The husband and wife immediately went forward to welcome them.

“Mom!”

“Old Madam Lin nodded. After so many days, when she saw Lin Jincheng and ye Shu again, Old Madam Lin still couldn’t help but feel guilty. “Jincheng, Ah Shu.” ”

Lin Jincheng took the wheelchair from ye Zhuo’s hands and smiled. “What do you siblings have to say? So Mysterious!”

“Ye Zhuo said, “Uncle isn’t here yet! Don’t be anxious.” ”

“With that said, Ye Shu became even more curious. ”

Ye Shu wasn’t the only one who was curious. Lin Jincheng was also very curious.

“About ten minutes later, ye Sen rushed in from outside the door. ”

“Uncle!”Ye Zhuo and Lin Ze immediately went up to greet him.

“Ye Sen smiled and said, “What big news do you siblings have to announce? Why are you in such a hurry to call me back?” ”

Lin Ze pulled ye Sen to sit down on the sofa.

“Ye Zhuo brought over a cup of tea. “Uncle, don’t worry. Have a sip of tea first.” ”

Ye Sen took a sip of tea.

“Ye Shu and Lin Jincheng couldn’t sit still anymore. They turned to look at Lin Ze and Ye Zhuo. “Now that your uncle is here, what’s the matter? Quickly tell us!” ”

“Ye Zhuo hesitated for a moment before continuing, “It’s about my mother’s background.” ”

Lin Jincheng was stunned.

Ye Shu was also stunned.

“A moment later, ye Shu asked in puzzlement, “Background? Is there something wrong with my background?” ”

Lin Ze took out the paternity test. “Take a look at this.”

Ye Shu took the paternity test and frowned slightly.

“What’s This?”Lin Jincheng looked over curiously. “Paternity test? Whose paternity test?”

“Ye Zao explained, “It’s my mother and Aunt Lang’s paternity test. Actually, my mother’s biological parents aren’t Yun Jing’s ye Dahai and Zhang Cuihua. Aunt Lang is her biological mother.” ”

PA —

The cup in Ye Sen’s hand fell to the ground.

Tea splashed everywhere.

“”Zao Zao, are you joking?” ”

How could it be?

How could ye Shu be someone else’s daughter?

“Ye Zao looked serious. “Uncle, I’m not joking.” ”

“How... How is that possible?”Ye Sen frowned.

“Seeing the words on the appraisal results, Ye Shu was stunned. ”

“Even if ye Dahai and Zhang Cuihua treated her badly, she had never thought that she was not their biological daughter. ”

But this seemed to explain why ye Dahai and Zhang Cuihua treated her badly.

Because she was not their daughter at all!

Lin Jincheng was also slightly stunned.

“Old Lady Lin was still rather calm. She raised her head to look at Ye Zhuo. “Zhuozhuo, are you referring to Aunt Lang as ye Langhua?” ”

“That’s right.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Upon hearing this, Old Lady Lin’s face was filled with astonishment. ”

She had never expected that ye Shu was actually ye Langhua’s daughter.

“”So, Ah Shu is... half a month?” ”

“Realizing this question, Old Mrs. Lin turned pale with fright. ”

“Of course, the person who was even more surprised was ye Sen. ”

He had always treated ye Shu as his biological sister...

“But now, Ye Shu had actually become someone else’s daughter. ”

What about him?

Would he not be ye Shu’s younger brother in the future?

Would he not be Lin Ze and ye Zhuo’s uncle?

“Thinking that they would not be family in the future, Ye Sen felt very uncomfortable. ”

“Ye Zao walked to Ye Sen’s side. “Uncle, don’t worry. You will always be our uncle!” ”

“”Zao Zao is right.”Lin Ze walked to Ye Sen’s side and held his arm. “No matter what happens, you will always be our uncle.” ”

“Seeing the siblings like this, Ye Sen was very touched. His eyes reddened as he hugged Lin Ze and ye Zhuluo. “Big nephew, big niece, thank you.” ”
