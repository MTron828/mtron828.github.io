“”Director you rest assured, I will not appear again tomorrow in the hospital.”Wang Dajun then opened his mouth. ”

He’ll leave the hospital.

“Director Han looked at him, then said: “Making a mistake is not terrible, terrible is not to know repentance.” ”

“After saying this, director Han paused for a moment. “Where are you going after leaving the hospital?”If he were to go to the logistics department, he could at least be a logistics department without any promotion. Although the head of the logistics department was not as glamorous as the chief physician, but much better than the average office worker. ”

“”Can not take the scalpel, I go where all the same.”Wang Dajun Way. ”

“Director Han some tired pinched temple, and then said: “You have considered it?” ”

“”Yes.”Wang Dajun nodded, words fall, Wang Dajun then said: “Director Han, you for my good I know, but I really have no face to come to the hospital.” ”

Director Han sighed softly. “It’s good that you’ve thought it through.”

“Wang Dajun continued, “Then I’ll be leaving first.” ”

“Okay.”Director Han nodded.

Wang Dajun turned around and left.

“The moment he turned around, his eyes instantly turned red and tears almost burst out of his eyes. ”

This was the place where he had worked for more than 20 years.

“Now, he had to leave in such a sorry state. ”

“At this moment, ye Zao, who was wearing a mask, walked towards him. ”

Wang Dajun subconsciously turned around.

No.

He could not let ye Zao find him in such a sorry state.

“It was obviously too late for him to turn around and not let ye Zao find him, because ye Zao had already seen him. ”

“Next, Ye Zao would definitely stop and mock him openly. ”

“After all, he was wrong this time. ”

Bear with it.

Bear with it for a while.

“No matter what ye Zao said to him, he would bear with it. ”

“Thinking about this, Wang Dajun pinched his fingers. As he used too much strength, his knuckles had already turned white. ”

“However, things did not develop in the direction that Wang Dajun had imagined. ”

“Ye Zao did not stop, nor did she mock him. She walked straight over, just like many other times. ”

“To her, Wang Dajun was still the same Wang Dajun. She would not attack Wang Dajun just because of a failed surgery. ”

“Wang Dajun was stunned. He turned around and looked at ye Zao’s back, not saying a word for a long time. ”

“In the end, he was still using the heart of a villain to measure the stomach of a gentleman. ”

Ye Zao was completely different from what he had imagined.

“At this moment, Wang Dajun seemed to have thought of something. He suddenly trotted forward and caught up with ye Zao. ”

“”Miss Ye, Wait!” ”

Ye Zao stopped and looked back.

“Wang Dajun was already defeated. He bowed to ye Zao and said, “Miss Ye, I’m Sorry!” ”

“After saying this, Wang Dajun quickly turned around and ran away. ” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

He had already used his lifetime’s courage to say that he was sorry. He had no face to face ye Zao directly.

Doctor Zhao looked at Wang Dajun’s actions and shook his head regretfully.

“If Wang Dajun had realized this earlier, he would not have ended up like this. ”

“”Miss Ye,”doctor Zhao turned to look at Ye Zhuo. “Weiwei is awake.” ”

“Awake?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“Yes.”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Then let’s go and see her.” ”

“Okay.”Doctor Zhao followed ye Zhuo’s footsteps.

“Soon, they arrived at Wei Wei’s ward. ”

Wei Wei had already woken up.

Liu Meilian was feeding Wei Wei some water.

“When she saw ye Zao come over, Liu Meilian immediately stood up and thanked him. “Miss Ye, you’re here! Take a seat! Miss Ye, you’re really our family’s Savior!” ”

“Liu Meilian’s face no longer had the usual malice on it. Now, she was truly grateful to ye Zao. ”

“If it wasn’t for Ye Zhuo, Weiwei would have been killed by Wang Dajun! ”

“”Miss Ye, you are a living God! If it wasn’t for you, how would our Weiwei still be alive?”Liu Meilian continued, “That Wang Dajun is a murderer. If it wasn’t for him, Weiwei wouldn’t have suffered so much!” ”

Liu Meilian said indignantly.

“Ye Zhuo ignored her and walked to Weiwei’s bed. He asked in a low voice, “How does Weiwei feel now?” ”

“Weiwei’s face was a little pale. “She’s fine. Thank you, thank you, Sister Ye.” ”

“”If you’re not feeling well, remember to call the Doctor,”ye Zhuo said. ”

“”Okay.”Weiwei looked at ye Zhuo and said, “Sister Ye, thank you! Thank you so much!” ”

“At the moment when the surgery failed and Liu Meilian and Xiang Chao said what they were thinking, Wei Wei was almost in despair! ”

“Fortunately, Ye Zhuo gave her another life. ”
