Chapter 157: 085: Lovely Old Mrs. Cen, my granddaughter-in-law is the most beautiful woman in the world! 1

After listening to the expert’s reply.

An Lizi was stunned.

Should she really not tell her mother about this?

Should she just let her mother be kept in the dark like this?

An Lizi continued to ask another question, [ hello, Expert. My mother is a hardworking and kind-hearted woman. She manages everything in and out of the house all by herself. If there is anything good to eat, she will leave it to me and my father. She loves me and my father very much. If I don’t say anything and just let her be kept in the dark like this, wouldn’t she be too pitiful... ? ]. ... ..

After typing this sentence, an Lizi was already in tears.

On one side was her mother, and on the other side was her father.

As a daughter, she really did not know what to do.

Her mother, Xia Xiaoman, was a typical housewife. Her husband was the god, and her son was the earth.

Xia Xiaoman was born in the countryside.

She and an Dongliang were in free love. After the two of them got married, they came to Yun Jing to fight together. Although they said that they would fight together, in reality, Xia Xiaoman was the one who was in the limelight.

In the beginning, Xia Xiaoman carried the burden and peddled all over the streets. She woke up early and went to bed late every day. As a result, Xia Xiaoman now looked more than ten years older than her peers. With an Dongliang standing beside her, she did not look like a husband and wife, she looked more like a brother and sister.

No one knew that Xia Xiaoman was only 41 years old this year.

......

From having nothing to owning a small supermarket and becoming a boss, Xia Xiaoman could be considered to have started from scratch.

It could be said that if it was not for Xia Xiaoman, an Dongliang would not have what he had today!

However, an Dongliang had betrayed her now.

If she did not see it with her own eyes, an Lizi would never believe that her father was such a heartless person.

Very soon, the expert replied again.

“Based on your description, I can tell that your mother is a very strong person. However, the stronger a woman is on the outside, the weaker she is on the inside! “If you really tell her about this, she will definitely fall apart. She might even do something drastic that you will regret! “If you are really doing this for your mother’s good, don’t tell her about this. In fact, sometimes, being kept in the Dark is also a happy thing

“As children, we only need to see our parents happy. Your father is very happy now, and your mother is very happy too. Isn’t that good? Why do you have to destroy this happiness with your own hands

“On the road of life, you will encounter many different kinds of things. You have to learn to forget, and also learn to grow up!”

An Lizi quietly listened to the voice message sent by the expert. She did not know what she felt.

In fact, the expert was quite right.

What if she told her mother about this and her mother could not bear the blow and did something extreme?

No!

She couldn’t lose her mother!

She couldn’t become an orphan without a mother.

An Lizi didn’t know when she fell asleep either.

She had a nightmare,

in the dream.

After her mother found out about this, she couldn’t bear the blow and jumped off a building to commit suicide.

Her brain matter and blood spilled all over the floor.

She didn’t have a mother anymore...

“Mom!”

An Lizi sat up from the bed with sweat all over her head. The images from the nightmare kept lingering in front of her, making her feel a lingering fear.

“Ding, Ding, Ding!”

Just then, a crisp alarm suddenly sounded in the air, pulling an Lizi’s thoughts back to reality.

An Lizi pressed the alarm clock back on.

After changing into her school uniform, she went to the bathroom to wash up.

“Lizi, you’re up.”Xia Xiaoman brought breakfast to the dining room and greeted an Lizi.

An Lizi wiped the foam from the corner of her mouth. “Where’s My Dad?”

“He’s sleeping,”Xia Xiaoman replied.

“Why isn’t he up yet?”An Lizi could not control her emotions and once again spoke up for her mother.

In this house.

Her mother was not only in charge of the house, she was also in charge of their food, clothing, accommodation, and travel.

She was also in charge of the outside world and was busy with the supermarket’s business.

What did an Dongliang do every day?

The thing that he did the most was to go out and buy goods.

In the past, an Lizi thought that her father really went out to buy goods.

Now it seemed like.

Going out to buy goods was just an excuse, right?

He was accompanying that mistress!

Xia Xiaoman was like a nanny, she was in charge of this and that.

What about an Dongliang?

An Dongliang was like a master. Not only did he not know how to be grateful, he even raised someone outside.

The more an Lizi thought about it, the angrier she got. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Seeing an Lizi like this, Xia Xiaoman frowned and said, “Lizi, what’s wrong with you? From last night onwards, your nose is not your nose and your eyes are not your eyes! Tell me, What’s wrong with you?”
