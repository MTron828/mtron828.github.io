The child was innocent.

Zhang Qingqing saw the changes in Lin Ze’s expression.

“Sure enough, no matter who it was, there would always be a weakness. ”

And Lin Ze’s biggest weakness was his growth experience.

Hitting the snake and striking the seven inches was indeed correct.

“Zhang Qingqing curled the corners of her lips and very well concealed the emotions in her eyes, she continued, “I think I already know your answer. Don’t worry, I Won’t disturb you in the future! This child has nothing to do with you! Goodbye!” Zhang Qingqing turned around and left. ”

“As she walked, she counted three in her heart. ”

She didn’t believe that Lin Ze wouldn’t fall for this provocation!

“”Wait!”At this moment, Lin Ze suddenly spoke. ”

“Do you have anything else?”Zhang Qingqing turned to look at him.

Lin Ze took a deep breath. “Whose child is it?”

“”Yours!”Zhang Qingqing continued, “If you don’t believe me, you can do a paternity test after you give birth! Lin Ze, you’re my first man!” ”

A paternity test had a method.

“Moreover, after the child was born, Lin Ze might not even think about doing a paternity test. ”

“”Let’s Get Married,”Lin Ze continued. ”

“He wanted to give the child a complete family. Even if he wasn’t ready to be a father, he would try his best to adapt. ”

“Hearing this, Zhang Qingqing was stunned. She looked at Lin Ze in disbelief. ”

She didn’t expect Lin Ze to get straight to the point so quickly.

Get Married!

She could marry Lin ze!

Zhang Qingqing’s eyes reddened as she walked to Lin Ze’s side. “Are you serious?”

“Yes.”Lin Ze nodded.

“”Thank you, thank you for being willing to give your child a complete home!”As she said that, Zhang Qingqing reached out to hug Lin Ze. Lin Ze flashed slightly and avoided Zhang Qingqing’s hug. ”

“If it was not for the child, he would have felt disgusted just by looking at Zhang Qingqing. ”

Proposing marriage was a man’s responsibility and a father’s responsibility!

“In short, he could not bear to see the child lose his father since he was young. ”

That kind of feeling was not good at all!

“Zhang Qingqing was not embarrassed and continued, “I know I can’t accept me for a while, but you are the child’s father after all. If you continue to be like this, it will be very detrimental to the child’s future growth!” ”

“”After the child is born, I will take care of it myself. You just need to take care of yourself,”Lin Ze said. ”

Zhang Qingqing was not a good mother to begin with. Letting her take care of the child was truly detrimental to the child’s future growth.

“There were some things that could be done slowly. Zhang Qingqing did not want to push Lin ze too hard. It would not be good if she made a fool of herself. Zhang Qingqing continued, “Then when are you going to go to my house to propose the marriage? To tell your parents about us?” ”

“”I will arrange this as soon as possible,”Lin ze said. ”

He did not know how his parents would react after hearing about this.

Lin Ze’s heart was in a mess. He felt very uncomfortable.

“Up until now, he still did not understand how things had come to this point! ”

“”Okay.”Zhang Qingqing nodded and asked, “You deleted my wechat?” ”

“Lin Ze did not answer her directly. Instead, he said, “Take down my number and call me if you need anything.” ”

“Okay.”Zhang Qingqing took out her phone. “What’s your phone number?”

Lin Ze gave her his phone number.

Zhang Qingqing saved his phone number.

“Lin Ze pinched his temples and continued, “Where are you from?” ”

Zhang Qingqing hid the pride in her heart. “I’ll ask my parents to come to Beijing directly. I’ll call you when they arrive.”

“Lin Ze nodded and looked at his phone. “I still have something to do, so I’ll leave first. I’ll talk to you after I’ve discussed it with my parents.” ”

“Okay.”

“After saying that, Lin Ze left the cafe. ”

“While driving, he was distracted by other things and almost bumped into the car in front of him. ”

Chi —

“Lin Ze stepped on the brakes, his face slightly pale. ” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Lin Ze laid his hands on the steering wheel and thought for a long time before turning around to go home.

“It was Saturday today, and Lin Jincheng and Ye Shu were both at home. ”

“Ye Shu kept a yard full of flowers and plants in the yard. Among them, the lilies were the most abundant. A gentle breeze blew out, bringing with it a faint floral fragrance, which was especially pleasant to smell. ”

“Ah Ze is back.”Ye Shu greeted Lin ze with a watering can.

Lin Ze nodded. “Mom.”

“After saying that, Lin ze continued, “Where’s Dad?” ”

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “Your dad is in the yard! Ah Ze, are you not feeling well? Why do you look so pale?” ”
