“Chapter 810: 178: Shunxi Financial Group, the mystery of the disappearance of half a month”

Translator: 549690339

It was as if she had known ye Zao for a very long time.

It was precisely because she had an inexplicable sense of familiarity with ye Zao that Aunt Lang gave the grasshopper that she had treasured for many years to ye Zao when they first met.

“If it wasn’t for the fact that her age wasn’t right, she would even suspect that ye Zao was the half a month that she had lost for many years. ”

Unfortunately.

Her age wasn’t right.

“Right now, Aunt Lang could only bury her longing for her daughter in the bottom of her heart and wait for the Little Half Moon. ”

The Little Half Moon was the place where her daughter went missing.

“She believed that if her daughter passed by this place one day and saw the Little Half Moon, she would definitely remember everything. ”

“Thinking of this, Aunt Lang’s eyes turned slightly red. ”

“Ye Zhuo looked at Aunt Lang, his brows and eyes curved. “Aunt Lang.” ”

“Aunt Lang forced back her tears. “Quickly follow me in. Two old ducks were sent over from the countryside this morning. Zhuozhuo, do you like the old duck vermicelli soup? If you like it, Aunt Lang will make it for you.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded and smiled. “I like eating the old duck vermicelli soup the most.”

“Aunt Lang nodded. “Okay, then I’ll go make the old duck vermicelli soup for you now. Shaoqing, take Zhuozhuo inside.” ”

“Okay.”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “There’s no rush to go inside. Cen Shaoqing, let’s go take a walk on the street. It’ll take some time for Aunt Lang to make the old duck vermicelli soup anyway.” ”

“Ye Zhuo had been in a hurry the last time and it was night, so he had yet to take a good look at this retro street. ”

“Aunt Lang said, “Right, right, right. Shaoqing, take Zhuozhuo around the neighborhood first. The old duck vermicelli soup will take at least half an hour. You guys can come back in half an hour.” ”

The two walked for half a month and strolled along the streets.

The walls were green and the tiles were flagstones.

On both sides of the flagstones were antique houses with two small lanterns hanging in front of every door.

Walking on such a small road gave people the illusion that they had traveled through ancient times.

The weather these days was not very good.

A layer of dark clouds covered the top of the street.

The Breeze was gentle and brought along a drizzle.

“It’s raining.”

Ye Zhuo pulled Cen Shaoqing and hid under the eaves.

“Walking in such an ancient town, the drizzle added a lot of charm. ”

“Ye Zhuo watched the raindrops drip down from the eaves, while the man next to her looked down at her. ”

It was affectionate.

It was as if she was the only one left in the world.

Ye Zhuo reached out to receive a drop of rain.

The two of them hid under the eaves for a while.

“Not only did the rain not decrease, but it was getting heavier. ”

It would not stop for a while.

“Cen Shaoqing saw that there was an umbrella seller not far ahead. “Leader, wait here for a while. I’ll go and buy an umbrella.” ”

“I’ll go with you.”Ye Zhuo’s gaze also landed not far away. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“”It’s not good for a girl to get caught in the rain.”After saying that, Cen Shaoqing rushed into the rain. ”

“About five minutes later, a tall figure appeared in ye Zao’s line of sight. ”

“The man was wearing a moon-white retro-styled long robe, with a bright red Buddhist bead in his right hand. There was a solemn and cold air in his refined and elegant manner, and his powerful domineering aura could not be ignored. His left hand was holding an oil-paper umbrella as he walked in the rain. ”

“In the mist, the man came with an umbrella, and his tall and straight figure seemed to blend into the misty rain of Jiangnan. ”

The man pursed his thin lips tightly. His facial features seemed to be covered with an impenetrable layer of frost. The flirtatious little red mole at the corner of his eye just happened to echo with the Buddha Pearl in his hand.

Ye Zao looked at him and smiled. “Why did you buy an umbrella?”

Cen Shaoqing stretched out his hand to ye Zao with a natural expression. “Because the shop only has one umbrella left.”

“Naturally, the shop only had one umbrella left. ”

It was because Cen Shaoqing did not want to be too far away from her.

“OH.”Ye Zhuo placed his hand on Cen Shaoqing’s hand.

The two of them walked together towards the small half moon.

“The oilpaper umbrella was not very big. Cen Shaoqing covered most of the umbrella above ye Zhuo’s head. In a short while, the rain drenched most of his shoulders. ”

“As she expected that it would not rain when ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing went out, Aunt Lang jogged over to deliver the umbrella to them. ”

“When she reached the corner, Aunt Lang saw two figures walking over from the opposite side. ”

Under the rain.

“The two of them were holding an umbrella. The Man’s face was like a crown of jade, and his temperament was extraordinary. One look and one could tell that he was a dragon and Phoenix among men. ”

“The little girl beside them was even more like a celestial being, and her entire body was shrouded in an aura that was like an orchid in an empty valley. ”

The misty rain and the ancient building behind them became the background panels for the two of them.

“Aunt Lang looked at the two people, the corner of her mouth unconsciously raised, quietly put away the umbrella in her hand, turned around and walked back. ”
