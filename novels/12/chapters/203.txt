Cen Shaoqing:”...”Ye Zao was really good to him.

“”Be careful!”At this moment, ye Zao suddenly grabbed Cen Shaoqing’s wrist. ”

“Even though there was a layer of cloth between them, Cen Shaoqing could still feel the warmth coming from the other party’s hand. ”

It was as if he had been electrocuted.

Cen Shaoqing stopped in his tracks and lowered his eyes in confusion.

The two of them. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

One was 1.71 meters.

The other was nearly 1.9 meters.

There was still a slight difference in height.

“From Cen Shaoqing’s angle, he could just see the exquisite contours of this person’s face. Looking down, he could see the beautifully curved collarbone. She was wearing a white shirt today. At this moment, due to her slightly bent back.., her collar was slightly open. ”

One could vaguely see the softness hidden in the white fabric. ... was soft.

“Realizing what it was, Cen Shaoqing’s face turned red and he immediately looked away. ”

Amitabha.

Don’t look at indecent things!

“At this moment, ye Zao’s voice came again. “There’s a puddle in front of you. Don’t you watch where you’re Going?” ”

Cen Shaoqing then realized that his feet had almost stepped into the puddle.

“Fortunately, ye Zao stopped him in time. ”

“”I didn’t pay attention just now. Thank you for the Reminder.”In just a moment, CEN Shaoqing’s expression returned to normal. He twirled the Buddhist beads in his hand and walked forward. ”

He looked calm.

“In fact, his heartbeat had already lost its rhythm. ”

“Soon, the two of them arrived at the foot of the mountain. ”

Cen Shaoqing came by car. “I’ll send you back first.”

“Don’t you need to wait for Grandma Cen and Aunt Xiang?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“No need.”Cen Shaoqing reached out and opened the car door. “A driver will come to pick them up.”

“Alright then.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and leaned into the car.

“About an hour later, the car stopped at the downstairs of the Ye family’s unit. ”

Ye Zhuo got out of the car to thank him.

“It’s my pleasure.”Cen Shaoqing got out of the car as well.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “It’s still early. Do you want to go to my house to have a cup of tea?” ”

“Sure.”

Ye Zhuo was stunned.

She was just being polite. She did not expect this person to agree.

“Come with me.”

Cen Shaoqing followed her footsteps.

“Ye Zhuoyuan thought that Cen Shaoqing was used to high-rise buildings and that he would more or less not be used to such a small space. After all, the Cen family’s living room was as big as their three-bedroom. ”

“However, Cen Shaoqing did not show any strange expression on his face. ”

“Ye Zhuoyuan brought the tea over. “Be careful, it’s hot.” ”

“Thank you.”Cen Shaoqing stood up and took the Teacup with both hands. He took a sip and a surprised look appeared in his eyes.

It was a very authentic golden melon tribute tea.

The temperature of the water was controlled just right.

“There was a faint aftertaste in the mouth. It was slightly bitter with some sweetness, soft and mellow. ”

“From this, it could be seen that ye Zhuo was also someone who knew tea. ”

“After finishing a cup of tea, Cen Shaoqing proposed to leave. ”

Ye Zhuo sent him out.

The two of them had just walked out of the unit building when they ran into Ye Sen who had just returned from the company.

“Zhuozhuo!”

“”Uncle.”Ye Zhuo then introduced ye Sen to Cen Shaoqing. “Fifth brother, this is my uncle. Uncle, this is my friend Cen Shaoqing.” ”

“Hello.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Ye Sen looked Cen Shaoqing up and down. He was very tall, very handsome, and very good-looking. With that extraordinary temperament around him, one could tell at a glance that he was a dragon and Phoenix among men! ”

“However, the more outstanding a man’s appearance was, the more likely he was to lie. ”

Especially a man like Cen Shaoqing.

He definitely did not lack women by his side!

He could not let ye Zao be deceived by a big pig’s Trotter! Let her follow ye Shu’s old path.

“Thinking of this, Ye Sen looked at Cen Shaoqing as if he was looking at [ a big fat pig is taking advantage of his family’s beautiful cabbage ] ! ”

“Ye Sen casually dealt with Cen Shaoqing and then held ye Zao’s hand. “Zao, let’s go home quickly.” ”

Ye Zao did not even have the time to greet CEN Shaoqing before he was dragged into the house by Ye Sen.

Cen Shaoqing was left standing on the spot with a slight frown.

He felt that ye Sen did not like him very much.

Was it an illusion?

In the house.

“”Uncle, what’s wrong? Is there an urgent matter for you to drag me back?” ”

“”It’s nothing. I’m just afraid that you’ve been deceived by someone. Back then, your mother...”. ... forget it ! It’s fine if you don’t say it ! Anyway, you must remember that some men may look bright and beautiful on the outside, but they are actually perverts dressed in sheep’s clothing ! They specifically lie to ignorant girls like you.” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “I admit to being a young girl, but I won’t admit to being ignorant! Uncle, don’t worry. Cen Shaoqing is not the kind of person you are talking about. Moreover, we are just ordinary friends. Don’t worry, I know what to do.” ”

“Thinking of Ye Zao’s ability, Ye Sen heaved a sigh of relief, but he still instructed, “In any case, you must be careful. Don’t be deceived by those human-faced, beast-hearted, and well-dressed pig trotters.” ”
