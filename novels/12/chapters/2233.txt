So that was the real point.

“Bai Jingshu said, “I don’t have that much charm to be pursued by second young master Du. It’s just a rumor.” ”

A rumor?

“When she heard this, Bai Mo looked up at Bai Jingshu. ”

She didn’t expect Bai Jingshu to have such a big appetite that even du Yaosheng didn’t like her.

Could it be that she really wanted to marry Manwen?

“Bai Mo smiled and said, “Sister, you’re too modest. We all know about this! Don’t hide it anymore!” ”

“”I really don’t,”Bai Jingshu said. “I can’t reach the second young master of the Du family. The two of you should stop joking around.” ”

“Bai Mo continued, “Sister, don’t be angry. We’re just casually talking. You know that girls like to gossip, right?” ”

Bai Jingshu hated awkward conversations the most in her life.

“Faced with two cousins who usually wanted nothing more than to be miles away from her, she really couldn’t continue the conversation. She made an excuse and said, “I suddenly remembered that grandfather has something to talk to me about. I’ll go over first.” ”

“Looking at Bai Jingshu’s back, Bai Mo narrowed his eyes. ”

“Bai Yuanyuan frowned and said, “This Bai Jingshu is really like a stone in the latrine!”She was smelly and hard! She tried to curry favor with Bai Mo in such a low manner, but Bai Jingshu turned a blind eye to it. ”

She really knew what she was!

Wasn’t she just a face?

“”No matter how good-looking she is, how can she be as good-looking as Miss Ye?”Bai Yuanyuan said unhappily, “What’s there to be proud of!” ”

“With her looks, how could she still look down on Du Yaosheng? ”

Little did she know that Du Yaosheng being able to take a fancy to her was already a blessing that she had cultivated for eight lifetimes.

“Bai Mo continued, “Bai Jingshu doesn’t seem to be fighting over anything. Time is peaceful, but she actually has a huge appetite.” ”

“In the entire Bai family, Bai Jingshu was the most ambitious. ”

It was a pity.

She lacked a mirror that could reflect her own reflection.

“She didn’t even know how much she weighed, yet she only knew how to fantasize. This kind of person was also disgusting. ”

“Bai Yuanyuan snorted coldly. Her tone was filled with disdain. “Mo Mo, you don’t know how many times better you are than her!” ”

Over here.

Bai Jingshu came to the back and chatted with the old man.

“Although the old man was in his nineties, he was still conscious. When he saw Bai Jingshu coming over, he smiled and said, “Jingshu, come here quickly. Grandpa has something for you.” ”

Bai Jingshu walked over. “Grandpa.”

“The Old Man took out a talisman paper tied with a red string and stuffed it into Bai Jingshu’s hand. He said kindly, “Jingshu, this is the marriage talisman that Grandpa specially asked for for you in the temple. I heard that it’s very effective. You must take it with you.” ”

This eldest granddaughter was the one that old master Bai was most worried about.

Bai Jingshu was different from the other granddaughters.

“She had a quiet personality and was not so scheming. She did not fight over anything, and even the things that she liked were so different from the rest. ” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

It was not easy to meet someone who appreciated each other. Old Master Bai hoped that she could find someone who truly understood her as soon as possible.

“Old Master Bai held Bai Jingshu’s hand tightly, he continued, “Jingshu, grandfather sincerely hopes that you can find someone who truly loves and understands you in the future. “After the two of you are together, you will be together for the rest of your life. Grandfather doesn’t want you to spend the rest of your life in disappointment and quarrels.” ”

“At this point, Old Master Bai paused. “Although grandfather hopes that you can start a family as soon as possible, grandfather doesn’t want you to start a family for the sake of starting a family. Marriage is not a mission, and you can’t make do with it. Grandfather hopes that you will be happy!” ”

Grandfather Bai’s words were spoken from the bottom of his heart.

Bai Jingshu was very touched by his words.

“In this family, the only person who truly cared about her was probably grandfather. ”

“Grandfather would care about whether she was happy or not, whether she was happy or not, and would make her refuse to make do with it. ”

“Her parents were more concerned about what kind of family she was going to marry into. It was as if she wasn’t marrying into a family, but married into a family instead. ”

“”Thank you, grandfather.” ”

Old Master Bai Chuckled. “What a silly child! I’m your grandfather. Why are you being so polite to me?”

“Bai Jingshu carefully put away the marriage talisman and continued, “Don’t worry, grandfather. I definitely won’t make do in the future. Find someone who understands me and understands me.” ”

“”Okay.”Old Master Bai nodded and smiled. “If your parents dare to Nag, Come find me. I’ll make the decision for you.” ”

“”Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded and rested her head on old master Bai’s shoulder. “Grandpa, do you have any requests for your future grandson-in-law?” ”

Old Master Bai shook his head. “I only have one request.”

“What request?”Bai Jingshu asked.

Old Master Bai smiled. “To treat you well. What You Love also loves you.”
