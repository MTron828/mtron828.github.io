“Xu Chaonan nodded and said, “It’s getting late. You should rest early.” ”

“”You too,”Xu Yao said. ”

On the other side.

At the He family home.

“The moment he ziteng reached home, he saw his parents sitting on the sofa in the living room, as if they were waiting for him to come back. ”

“”Dad, Mom, why aren’t you sleeping at night?” ”

“Father he didn’t say anything. Mother he smiled and looked up. “Ziteng, I heard that you’ve been chasing after a young lady recently, is that right?” ”

“That’s right.”He ziteng nodded.

“Mother he continued, “Which family’s young lady is she from? Tell your father and me about it.” ”

“He ziteng glanced at mother he and continued, “You already know about this matter, but you still don’t know which family’s young lady she is from?” ”

“The Xu Family?”Mother he asked.

“That’s right.”He ziteng nodded.

“Mother he picked up the cup and took a sip of water. “Ziteng, your father and I don’t agree to this matter, so you’d better not waste your time on her.” ”

Don’t agree?

Why?

Weren’t his parents always the most anxious about his personal matters?

“”Mother, why don’t you agree?”He ziteng asked. ”

“Mother he continued, “Your father and I have investigated. Xu Yao is quite a complicated young lady. She’s not suitable for you.” ”

Especially Xu Yao’s family.

Xu Yao’s father was a glutton and a lazybones. The reason why the Xu family could live the life they had now was all because of Xu Chaonan.

“If the Xu family did not have Xu Chaonan, they would be a pile of loose sand. ”

“When Xu Yao was in high school, she once had a passionate relationship. However, after she went back to her hometown with the man, they broke up! ”

The man’s family was in a difficult situation. He was famous for being poor in the local area. It was obvious why Xu Yao broke up with him.

The He family did not need a daughter-in-law who despised the poor and loved the rich.

“The He family’s parents did not place much importance on the woman’s family background, but the woman’s character must be good! ”

“After all, there was a saying that whether one was poor or not depended on their children and grandchildren. Whether one was rich or not depended on their daughter-in-law. ”

Choosing a good daughter-in-law was a crucial matter.

“Father he nodded. “Your mother is right. Marriage is not just a matter of two people, it is also a matter of two families. Take advantage of the fact that you do not have any feelings for her yet, and quickly stop.” ”

He ziteng frowned. “Father and mother! What are you talking about! I like Xu Yao. I just want to be with her. None of you can stop me!”

“Hearing that, mother he frowned. “Then do you know her? Do you know what kind of person she is?” ”

“He ziteng said, “I only know that I like her. Father and mother, do you dislike Xu Yao’s birth?” ”

Was birth really that important?

“In he ziteng’s opinion, liking her was enough. ”

“Moreover, he trusted Xu Yao. ”

Xu Yao was definitely not that kind of material girl.

“Mother he looked at He ziteng, then she said, “Ziteng, be reasonable. Your father and I are not against you dating. Nor are we overly demanding of a girl’s family background! We only hope that the woman has a good character, is kind, and is well-educated.” ”

“”Since it’s not that you dislike Xu Yao’s family background, then what does Xu Yao have that makes you unhappy?”He ziteng continued, “Mom, don’t you believe in your Son’s judgment?” ”

“Xu Yao was very kind and sensible. Putting aside the issue of family background, she was the most perfect daughter-in-law. ”

“In He Ziteng’s view, his parents obviously disliked Xu Yao’s birth, but they said it was another issue! ”

It was simply hypocritical! ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“”Ziteng, you don’t understand Xu Yao at all. Everything that Xu Yao has shown in front of you now is just an act. That’s not the real her at all!”Mother he continued, “In short, your father and I don’t agree with this matter. Think about it carefully!” ”

“After saying that, mother he stood up and left. ”

Father he also stood up.

“Looking at the backs of his parents, he ziteng was very helpless. ”

“This was the first time he had treated a girl so seriously, but his parents objected. ”

No.

No.

He could not give up on Xu Yao so easily.

“True Love was meant to go through trials and tribulations. He believed that one day, his parents would accept him and Xu Yao together. ”

“Thinking of this, he ziteng was full of confidence in the future. ”

“At around seven o’clock in the evening, Ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing returned to the Cen family manor. ”

“Seeing the two of them return, Old Mrs. Cen was especially happy. “Yezi is back! I thought you weren’t coming!” ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Since I promised you, how could I not come?” ”
