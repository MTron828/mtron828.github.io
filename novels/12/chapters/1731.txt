Chapter 1732: 258: the consequences of their actions will be disastrous! 6

Translator: 549690339

“No matter how powerful they were, they couldn’t fight against humans. ”

Humans were the masters of the universe.

“Roger!”

“Roger!”

Everyone braced themselves and fought against the mutants outside.

Bang Bang Bang!

“At this moment, the mutants outside were already trying to pry open the cabin door. ”

“The attack team fired many nuclear bombs, but they were all directly devoured by the mutants. ”

Soon.

The attack team’s nuclear bombs were depleted.

The defense team couldn’t hold on much longer either.

Boom!

“A group of mutants jumped to the top of the spaceship, causing the spaceship to shake violently. The interior of the spaceship could barely stand on its feet. ”

The smell of death assaulted them.

The atmosphere in the cabin was extremely tense.

This was Europa.

There were mutants eating humans outside again.

“If they died, there wouldn’t even be a corpse collector. ”

“They originally thought that Europa was a beautiful planet. After this successful landing, they would also obtain glory and become the first batch of humans to land on Europa. ”

Who would have thought that Europa was as dangerous as ye Zao said.

These mutants were even more terrifying.

They could even absorb nuclear bombs!

“”I don’t want to Die! My child has just been born, I haven’t held her yet.” ”

“”I don’t want to die either, I want to go back to Earth! God, please let us go back!” ”

“”Dad, Mom, I Miss You...” ”

“Director ma collapsed on the ground, his face devoid of life. ”

He recalled ye Zao’s words.

What did ye Zao say back then?

“She said that all the beauty of Europa was just a facade. As long as he logged into Europa, he would definitely regret it! ”

“At that time, director Ma only thought that ye Zao was bragging! ”

He did not expect that ye Zao’s words would come true!

Regret.

He was extremely regretful now.

He was so regretful that his intestines had turned green.

It was a pity.

There was no medicine for regret in the world.

Boom!

“At this moment, a loud sound came from above his head. ”

Director ma looked up and saw that it was a xenogeneic that had lifted the top of the spaceship and was screaming.

Just listening to it made one’s scalp go numb.

“The next second, a dark red claw reached in and grabbed two people! ”

“No! No! Let Go of me!”

“Help!”

The cabin was in chaos.

“Some cried, some shouted, and some ran. ”

Director Ma hid behind the attack platform and looked up.

“After the mutants grabbed the people, they tore them in half and swallowed them whole. ”

It was as simple as a human squeezing an ant to death.

It was even easier than squeezing an ant to death.

“Director Ma’s eyes were filled with fear. He curled up in a corner, his whole body trembling. ”

Boom Boom Boom —

The cabin was filled with the sound of items falling to the ground and the sound of escaping footsteps.

“Seeing the danger approaching him step by step, the working partners in the cabin disappeared into the air one by one. Director Ma quietly retreated. ”

“Behind the attack stage, there was a small first aid cabin with an emergency equipment inside. ”

Bang!

“After closing the door of the first-aid cabin. Director Ma took a deep breath, then immediately picked up the camera equipment inside and started recording, “Miss Ye, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have betrayed you, and I shouldn’t have disobeyed your teachings and forcefully landed on Europa. I was wrong! I was really wrong! But there is no medicine for regret in this world.” ”

“”As you said, Europa is a planet full of danger. All of its beauty is just a surface appearance... ... I was wrong, I was really wrong ! Professor Feng was killed because of me. If it weren’t for me, Professor Feng wouldn’t have died ... ...” ”

“At the end, director Ma almost burst into tears. ”

“But now, what was the use of crying? ”

Bang!

“In the next second, the first aid cabin was destroyed by the XENOGENEIC. ”

There was no place to hide now.

“Looking at the one close at hand, director Ma quickly pressed the send button. ”

“Then, director Ma picked up the gun on the side, pointed it at his temple, and pulled the trigger. ”

Bang!

Fresh blood dyed the wall on the side red.

“Compared to being torn in half, director Ma was more willing to die happily. ”

“At the same time, the video signal that director Ma recorded before firing the gun was transmitted to Earth. ”

The big screen that was already black suddenly lit up again.

Director Ma appeared in front of the big screen in a sorry state and said his last words.

“”Miss Ye, I’m sorry...” ”

“The message lasted about ten minutes. Apart from apologizing to Ye Zhuo, he also warned the others not to land on the Europa! ”

Because the danger level on the Europa was much higher than expected!

“As the roof of the first aid cabin was opened, the video ended and the big screen returned to darkness. ”

“When worker Xu called Ye Zhuo over, the video had already finished playing. ”

Cen Jiang clicked on the replay.

“Seeing director Ma’s regretful look, Ye Zhuo’s expression was indifferent. She did not have the sympathy to sympathize with a traitor. ”

“Where’s Professor Feng?”Ye Zhuo continued to ask.

“Cen Jiang said, “Professor Feng was...”the rest of his words were self-evident. ”

Ye Zhuo did not expect this. She thought that director Ma was the only person from country C to land on Europa. She did not expect these two people to land on Europa at the same time.

“”Okay, I got it!”Ye Zhuo turned around and walked out. ”

“Miss Ye!”Gu Si stood up from the chair.

“What’s Wrong?”Ye Zhuo looked back slightly and looked at Gu si.

“Gu Si bowed to ye Zao. “Miss Ye, I’m sorry. I apologize for my words and actions. At the same time, I also want to thank you. If it weren’t for you, we would have been the ones who died on Europa today!” ”

Country C.

Country C suffered heavy losses this time. Dr. Cara was filled with regret.

He thought that he could obtain precious resources from Onoba this time. He didn’t expect that he would suffer a double loss!

“Gamira said, “Professor, don’t worry. In China, besides Feng Qi and Ma Jianbang, there must be other people who possess the speed of light technology!” ”

“”Okay.”Professor Kara nodded. “Then, I’ll leave this matter to you!” ”

“Gamira said, “Don’t worry, I’ll definitely take care of this matter!” ”

“”Also, get someone to go to Feng Qi’s house.”Professor Kara continued, “We must get the Song dynasty national treasure that Feng Qi mentioned!” ”

Dr. Cara had a hunch.

“There must be other secrets hidden on the National Treasure of the Song dynasty. If it was only valuable, professor Feng wouldn’t be so nervous. ”

“Got it.”
