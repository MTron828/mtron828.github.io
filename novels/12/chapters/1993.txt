“In an instant, a beam of light shone ahead. ”

Ye Zao continued to swim forward.

“Although the depths of the trench were pitch black, there were still all kinds of marine life. ”

Some fish even ye Zao couldn’t name.

But it looked very delicious.

“If ye Zao didn’t have business, he would definitely catch one and taste it. ”

Time passed by slowly.

Cen Shaoqing had been standing in front of the yacht waiting for her.

“It had been an hour and fifty-three minutes since they agreed on two hours, but there was still no movement from ye Zao’s side. ”

“Cen Shaoqing’s expression did not change. He only held his hand on the railing. Because he had used too much strength, his knuckles had turned slightly white. ”

He was a little worried.

Could it be that ye Zao had encountered some danger at the bottom of the sea.

“Just as Cen Shaoqing was about to dive into the submarine, a person suddenly appeared on the surface of the water. ”

“”Cen Shaoqing, I’m back.” ”

She looked at Cen Shaoqing with a faint smile on her face.

“The black halter top contrasted with her jade-like skin, making her appear black and white. ”

Her black hair was completely draped behind her head under the baptism of the seawater.

“If there was one sentence that could describe the scene at this moment, it would be: ”

“Natural decoration, clear water out of hibiscus. ”

Cen Shaoqing took out his phone and captured the most beautiful scene.

“After taking the photo, Cen Shaoqing put his phone into his pocket and walked to the deck. He reached out his hand and said, “Come up quickly.” ”

Ye Zao swam over and put his hand on his.

Cen Shaoqing held her hand tightly and pulled her up gently.

“Maybe it was because he couldn’t hold back his strength, or maybe it was because of other reasons, Ye Zao fell directly into his arms after he landed on the deck. ”

“No matter what kind of clothing material it was, it would become transparent after being wet by the water. ”

Ye Zao’s body was very full.

“As long as Cen Shaoqing lowered his head, he could see that it was about to come out. ”

Don’t look when it’s indecent.

Cen Shaoqing silently moved his gaze away and looked at the surface of the sea.

“”I found a trench at the bottom of the sea, and then...” ”

“Before ye Zao could finish his sentence, Cen Shaoqing picked up a dry towel at the side and draped it over her shoulder. “The sea water is cold. Go take a shower first. Put on your clothes and come out. Be careful not to catch a cold.” ”

“Alright.”Ye Zao wrapped the towel tightly and ran in the direction of the bathroom.

He finally left.

“Cen Shaoqing heaved a sigh of relief. He walked to the refrigerator, opened the door, and took out a bottle of iced coke. ”

Gulp Gulp.

“In less than a minute, the bottle of coke was empty. ”

Cen Shaoqing threw the empty bottle into the trash can five meters away. He stood on the deck and blew at the sea breeze for a while before ye Zao walked out.

“”I found a trench at the bottom of the sea.”Ye Zhuo continued, “And I found a sunken ship in the trench.” ”

“Really?”Cen Shaoqing’s expression changed.

“Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and took out his phone. “Look, is this sunken ship the same as uncle’s?” ”

Cen Shaoqing took the phone and immediately shook his head slightly. “It’s not the same ship.”

“Isn’t it?”Ye Zhuo took the phone. “Do you have a photo of that ship? Let me take a look.”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. He took out the phone and took out the photo that had been preserved for many years.

“Ye Zhuo took the phone and took a look. He then said, “Do you think it’s this ship?” ”

“After saying that, he took out the phone that had already been put into his pocket with his left hand. He opened the photo and took out another photo of the sunken ship. ”

“When he saw this photo, Cen Shaoqing’s pupils constricted. “It’s this.” ”

“”It’s This?”Ye Zhuo frowned slightly and continued, “I went in to take a look at this sunken ship. It doesn’t look like an accident. It looks more like a man-made intervention. Moreover, there are no human remains inside.” ”

“Under normal circumstances, the ship would have been overturned at the bottom of the sea by the huge waves. The things inside, including the surface of the ship, would definitely be damaged. ”

“However, after ye Zao went in to take a look, he found that every piece of decoration inside was intact. ”

“It was just that it had been immersed in the sea for too long, and there were many sea creatures growing inside. ”

“Most importantly, there were more than 1,300 people on the ship back then. Even if all the people on the ship had been eaten up by fish due to the sinking of the ship, there should still be debris left behind. ”

“However, there wasn’t any. ”

“Judging from the condition of the ship’s preservation, there shouldn’t be any giant sea creatures nearby. If there were giant sea creatures, the various decorations on the ship had already been decorated, so it was impossible to preserve them completely. ”

“In other words, the people on the ship should have been moved away before the ship sank! ”

“Are you sure?”Cen Shaoqing looked at Ye Zhuo.

“Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Yes, I’m sure. Why don’t I accompany you down to take a look?” ”

“Can you still hold on with your physical strength?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“”No problem,”ye Zao said. ”
