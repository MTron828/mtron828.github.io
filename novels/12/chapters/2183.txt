“”So, Li Man wasn’t found by Li Man?”Asked ye Zhuo. ”

Leo shook his head.

Li Man was too well-hidden. Leo had used a lot of connections but still couldn’t find her.

Ye Zhuo frowned slightly.

It was impossible for Li Man to come to him for no reason.

There must be a reason behind this.

“Seeing how she was, Leo continued, “Father, do you want to investigate the reason for Li Man’s sudden appearance? Do you think there might be an explosion in the middle?” ”

“Although man Jiangshan and Zhao Dan had been sentenced, they were still the leaders of Manxing country. As long as Manxing filed an appeal, the interstellar court would have to reconsider. ”

“”No need,”ye burning continued, “I think I know the reason.” ”

“Leo asked curiously, “Father Burning, do you know who made Li man appear?” ”

“Yes.”Ye burning nodded slightly.

“Leo continued, “Can you tell me?” ”

“No.”

“Leo immediately followed ye burning’s footsteps. “Father Burning, am I still your good eldest son?” ”

On the other side.

“Man Wen also watched the live broadcast. His expression turned from anger to a slight smile. The moment he saw his parents being handcuffed, the huge rock weighing down on his heart finally disappeared. ”

Nineteen years.

“After nineteen years, those who hurt his sister finally got their comeuppance. ”

“Fan Mu was sitting next to man Wen. When he saw this scene, he turned to look at man Wen, he said with a sigh, “I really didn’t expect your eldest sister to be so miserable when she was young. She was lucky to survive like this! “Oh right, your parents are locked up. Your second sister will definitely take action next. What do you plan to do?” ”

“”Fair competition,”man Wen said. ”

“He had been lying low for so long, waiting for this day. ”

“No matter what, he definitely could not hand Manxing over to Manxing. ”

“Your second sister has connections and connections in Manxing. There are a lot of people who choose her. What do you have to compete with her fair competition?”Fan Mu asked.

“Man Wen continued, “She has a good plan, and I have a wall ladder.” ”

“Looking at man Wen like this, Fan Mu was a little speechless and said, “Brother, you still don’t know your current position, right? With your current reputation, it’s difficult for you to even make it onto the rankings. How are you going to compete fairly with her?” ”

“In order not to show off, Man Wen’s reputation in Manxing country had been extremely bad all these years. ”

“Man Wen continued, “Don’t worry, I’ll definitely make it onto the rankings.” ”

“”Alright, even if you make it onto the list, what about the voting segment later?”Speaking up to this point, fan mu narrowed his eyes and continued, “Don’t tell me you have a way? Did you look for your eldest sister?” ”

“If he had ye Zhuo’s help, Man Wen would definitely be able to ascend to the presidency. ”

“No.”Man Wen shook his head. “Even the paternity test said that she has nothing to do with me. You should also stop calling her my sister in the future.”

Ye Zhuo had completely lost all ties with the man family.

And he did not want to become ye Zhuo’s burden.

What man Wen could do now was to do his best and leave it to fate.

“”Speaking of the paternity test,”fan mu narrowed her eyes. “What’s going on? Why isn’t the relationship between Miss Ye and Auntie established?” ”

“Man Wen said, “Because she’s not my sister.” ” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“”Brother, this is boring. Why are you still pretending to be me?”Fan Mu tapped man Wen on the shoulder. ”

Man Wen did not say anything.

“Because of man Jiangshan and Zhao Dan’s sudden imprisonment, Manxing country was in an emergency crisis. ”

“Fortunately, the vice president was there to support it. ”

The country could not be without a ruler for one day. They had to choose a new ruler.

“The vice president could not become a full official for the rest of his life. As the president, he had to choose a successor from the man family. ”

“Man Jiangshan had three nephews, one son and one daughter. ”

“Man Wen had a good reputation. Even if he made the list, no one would choose him. ”

“As for man Jiangshan’s other three nephews, they were even worse than man Wen! ”

“Therefore, man Xing did not have to worry about the issue of the election at all. ”

What man Xing was most worried about was his parents.

Were they really going to let his parents stay in prison for ten years?

“”Xing ‘er, the most important thing for you now is to prepare for the election.”Master Cao walked to man Xing’s side. ”

“Man Xing turned around. “Man Wen is a good-for-nothing. Man Fei, man Qiang, and man Zang are not much better than man Wen. You Don’t have to worry about the election.” ”

“”But you can’t let your guard down. What if something unexpected happens?”Master Cao continued, “Just like this time.” ”
