Translator: 549690339

“Ye Zao was not a pushover. He looked at him and said, “Then come!” ”

“There were thousands of stars in her eyes. She blinked and blinked, as if she could charm people’s hearts. ”

Cen Shaoqing only felt that the giant beast that was locked in his heart had suddenly broken free from its cage and soared into the sky. It was unstoppable.

“Although the arrow was already on the bow, Cen Shaoqing’s calmness was still there. He let go of Ye Zao and stood up straight. Forget it, he really did not dare. ”

Cen Shaoqing turned around and left in a hurry.

Ye Zao looked at his voice and chuckled.

“”Mr. Cen, I thought you were very capable, but it turns out that you’re just so-so.” ”

Cen Shaoqing stopped in his tracks and looked back slightly. He looked at ye Zao and opened his thin lips. “I’ll write this down in my notebook.”

“When the time came, he would definitely get it back. ”

“Ye Zhuo chuckled. “Alright, I’ll wait.” ”

Cen Shaoqing turned around and walked towards the bathroom.

“After a while, Cen Shaoqing walked out of the bathroom. ”

He came to the lounge once again. Ye Zhuo was already asleep.

“Her sleeping face was peaceful, and it made people want to take a few more glances at her. ”

Cen Shaoqing sat beside her. He supported his chin with one hand and looked at her.

Four hours passed very quickly.

“The moment they landed, Ye Zhuo opened his eyes. “Are we here?” ”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “We’re here.”

Ye Zhuo turned to look at the direction of the clock.

“They had boarded the plane at nine o’clock in the evening, and it was one o’clock in the morning. ”

Cen Shaoqing picked up a thin coat and draped it over ye Zhuo. “The temperature difference in the South China Sea is quite large in the morning and evening. Drape your coat over your shoulders.”

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded.

The two of them walked towards the exit together.

Cen Shaoqing took the suitcase from the pilot. He held the suitcase with one hand and held ye Zao’s hand with the other.

“Have you found a place to stay?”Ye Zao continued to ask.

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Can we temporarily stay at the Seaside Villa Tonight?”

“He happened to have a villa at the seaside, which was not far from here. ”

“”Yes,”ye Zhuo continued to ask, “Then where are we going tomorrow?” ”

“”To the island tomorrow,”Cen Shaoqing answered. ”

“Yes.”

“Every time he went out with Cen Shaoqing, Ye Zhuo did not need to think because Cen Shaoqing could arrange everything properly. ”

On the other side.

Bai Mo had not been doing well recently.

She was looking forward to her parents finding her every day.

But there was no news.

Even Bai Yuanyuan had not received any news.

“”Is the meal ready? What are you waiting for?”At that moment, Liu Chao’s voice came from the living room. ”

Bai Mo’s thoughts were pulled back at that moment. “It’ll be ready soon.”

“In less than three months, Bai Mo had gone from a high and mighty heiress to a housewife who washed her hands and made soup. ”

Bai Mo had always thought that she was dreaming.

“Her life was supposed to be bright, but how did it become like this. ”

“When will it be ready?”Liu Chao’s dissatisfied voice sounded again.

Bai Mo immediately lifted the lid of the pot and began to fill it with soup. “It’ll be ready soon.”

“Not long after, Bai Mo brought the soup to the dining room. ”

Liu Chao looked at Bai Mo and frowned slightly. “What’s wrong with you today?”

“Bai Mo smiled and explained, “I have to cook the Soup for a while longer today.” ”

Liu Chao did not say anything else and began to eat.

Bai Mo came over from the kitchen with some food and sat down at the dining table to eat.

The air was a little quiet and there was only the sound of each other chewing.

“If Liu Chao looked up at Bai Mo at this moment, he would definitely realize that Bai Mo’s eyes were filled with monstrous hatred. ”

“Ever since she was trapped on Earth, Bai Mo had never stopped wanting to kill Liu Chao. ”

Liu Chao was such a lowly person!

“After eating, Liu Chao placed the empty bowl on the table. ”

Bai Mo immediately put down her bowl and went to serve Liu Chao Rice.

“Looking at Bai Mo like this, Liu Chao’s eyes were filled with satisfaction. ”

“Very soon, Bai Mo served the rice. ”

“Liu Chao continued, “We’ll go to the hospital in the afternoon.” ”

Bai Mo was stunned. “What for?”

“”To find out why you haven’t been able to get pregnant,”Liu Chao said. ”

Liu Chao’s biggest dream was to have a wife and children to heat up the bed.

Although Bai Mo was not his ideal type.

But the current Bai Mo was a qualified wife.

“Moreover, the Bai family’s genes were not bad, and their children would definitely be very outstanding in the future. ”

“Hearing this, Bai Mo’s heart was like a raging sea. She wished she could pick up the kitchen knife in the kitchen and directly Chop Liu Chao’s head. ”

“At this moment, Bai Mo could no longer hide the worries in her eyes. ”

Liu Chao threw down his chopsticks and directly slammed the table and stood up. “Why? Are you not happy giving birth to my child?”
