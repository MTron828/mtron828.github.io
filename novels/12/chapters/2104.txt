“”Hehe.”The spirit continued, “With your silly appearance, you’re still the number one in the universe! I think you’re the number one in the universe, are you kidding me?” ”

“Little White was furious. It placed its hands on its hips, “Get lost! Bite it!” ”

Rollie immediately rushed out and made a plop towards the spirit.

“Only the heavens knew that the spirit was most afraid of dogs. It flew high up and said proudly, “I can’t bite it, you can’t bite it! hahahaha! Stupid Dog, stupid dog, if you have the ability, bite me! Slightly slightly slightly!”In the end, she even made a face at little white and Rollie. ”

Little White was so angry that it wanted to bite someone. “This dog! It’s even more dog than little white!”

This scene made ye Zao Smile.

“At this moment, she received a text message. ”

“This was a text message from the s galaxy. They must have found something. Ye Zao immediately took out his phone and opened it. As expected, it was sent by ye Han via radio waves. ”

“Because there was a limit to the number of words, there were only seven words on the message ”

The sample had been successfully obtained.

Ye Zao narrowed his eyes. It seemed that the results would be seen soon.

“However, the current her was not as relaxed as she had imagined. ”

“Instead, her mood was a little heavy. ”

“The truth was getting closer and closer. If the one in the main alliance was really Cen Shaoqing’s father, how would Cen Shaoqing Face Him? ”

And Zhou Xiang.

“From the time she was in her prime until she was over 50 years old, she had kept the faithful love between them. ”

But now...

“Ye Zhuo’s heart was suddenly in a mess, but he still edited the text message and sent a message to CEN Shaoqing to inform him of this matter. ”

“After the message was sent, CEN Shaoqing did not reply immediately. ”

His current mood was also very complicated.

“A moment later, ye Zhuo’s phone rang. ”

It was Cen Shaoqing Calling.

“Ye Zhuo stood up from the rocking chair and said, “Dad, Mom, I’m going back to my room. Don’t Wait for me when I eat later.” ”

“”Then I’ll get someone to send it to your room later,”Lin Jincheng said. ”

“”Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and picked up the phone. As he spoke, he walked into the room. ”

He did not hang up the phone until half an hour later.

Ye Zao stood in front of the French window. “You haven’t eaten yet? How about you?”

“I’m eating now.”

“Just then, there was a knock on the door. “Miss, Sir asked me to bring you some food.” ”

“Ye Zao continued, “My dad asked someone to bring you some food.” ”

“”Then let’s video chat on wechat,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“”Okay.”Ye Zhuo hung up the phone and said to the door, “Come in.” ”

The maid came in with the food.

“Ye Zhuo asked, “What are we eating tonight?” ”

“”It’s hand-made ramen,”the maid replied. ”

“”OH.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. Looking at the maid, a faint light flashed in his eyes. “Are you new to our family?” ”

“”Yes.”The maid nodded. “Miss, it’s my first day at work today.” ”

“What’s Your Name?”Ye Zao asked.

“The maid continued, “You can call me Lan Fang.” ” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Ye Zao nodded slightly and continued, “You can go down first.” ”

“”Yes, miss.”Lan Fang turned around and walked out of the door. ”

“At this moment, ye Zao’s beautiful eyes narrowed slightly. He picked up the silver needle on the table and flicked it out. ”

Xiu.

The silver needle hit the back of Lan Fang’s neck.

Bang —

“The next second, Lan Fang fell to the ground, unconscious. ”

Ye Zao walked over and put his hand on Lan Fang’s wrist. A beautiful smile appeared on his face. Her guess was right. This was a core robot.

“Originally, because of Man Wen, it was not strange for a core robot to appear beside ye Zao. ”

“However, the strange thing was that this interstellar person was not man Wen. ”

“Ye Zao took out a tool and tore the core robot into pieces. Finally, she found a chip in a pile of parts. ”

Wang.

“In the S Galaxy, the biggest core robot processing factory was the Wang family. ”

But why would the Wang family place a core robot beside her?

Ye Zao narrowed her eyes.

It seemed that she still had to investigate this matter clearly.

“After studying it for a while, ye Zao put the core robot back. ”

“After a few minutes, the core robot returned to its original state and walked out. ”

“In the blink of an eye, the next day arrived. ”

Ye Zhuo had just woken up when he received a message from ye Han.

It was a copy of the results of the paternity test.

“However, Ye Zhuo did not open the document immediately. Instead, he called Cen Shaoqing and told him that the results of the paternity test were out. She would arrive at the Cen House in fifteen minutes. ”

“After making the call, ye Zao went to wash up. ”

“Fifteen minutes later, a Land Rover rushed out of the manor’s garage. ”

“Twenty minutes later, the Land Rover stopped at the entrance of the CEN residence. ”

The car had just stopped when Cen Shaoqing walked forward and opened the car door. “What’s the result?”

“Ye Zao continued, “I haven’t read it yet.” ”

“Regardless of the result, Cen Shaoqing should have opened the report personally. ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “There’s no rush. Let’s eat first.”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“After eating, the two of them went to the study room. ”

Ye Zhuo handed the phone to Cen Shaoqing. “Take a look.”

Cen Shaoqing took the phone and opened the information.

“The next second, his face turned slightly pale. ”
