“The young woman was stunned for a moment before continuing, “Sir, do you know her?” ”

The middle-aged man had an indescribable expression on his face.

Similar.

It was too similar!

“At this moment, he thought that he was hallucinating. ”

But she was already dead!

He had personally watched her turn into ashes. How could she appear on earth?

“”Go and call the young miss over,”the middle-aged man said. ”

“Okay.”The young woman nodded.

“After leaving the house, she flew into the air in a simple aircraft. ”

“Soon, the aircraft stopped in front of a circular building. ”

The young woman walked down from the aircraft.

“Just as she reached the door, she was stopped by the man guarding the door. ”

“The man was wearing a high-class uniform. His facial features were handsome. Standing at the door, he looked like a statue. ”

“Stop!”

“The young woman took off her glasses. “Hello, Captain Wu. I’m Yuan Yi. I’m here to see Miss under the orders of Officer Qiu.” ”

The man did not even look at Yuan Yi. “Identification.”

Identification?

“She had already announced her family name, but she did not expect Wu Han to still ask her for identification. ” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“She had been by Qiu Chang Town’s side for decades and had frequently appeared at various occasions. In Chang Yue, there was no one who did not recognize her. ”

Her face was the best pass.

She did not expect to be stopped today by someone who wanted to see her ID.

Yuan Yi was a little speechless.

“She had long heard that Wu Han, who was by Qiu Di’s side, was unapproachable and impartial. Other than Qiu Di, he treated everyone coldly. ”

“Previously, Yuan Yi did not believe him. Now that she saw him in person, Yuan Yi finally believed him. ”

“”Okay, wait a moment, I’ll Find Your ID.” ”

“Yuan Yi lowered her head to look for the id, but she found that she didn’t bring it at all. ”

“”Sorry, Captain Wu, I forgot to bring my ID. Can you scan the chip?”In changyue, everyone had a chip, and scanning the chip could get the identity information. ”

“”No,”Wu Han said expressionlessly. ”

“Yuan Yi sighed, “Captain Wu, can’t you just be flexible? I really have something urgent to see Miss! Besides, I have a chip, not a chip!” ”

“”Identification Card,”Wu Han said. ”

“”I already said that I didn’t bring my identification card,”Yuan Yi continued, “I’ve been by Officer Qiu’s side for 10 years! Can I still harm miss?” ”

“Wu Han repeated, “Identification Card.” ”

This Wu Han was really an iron wall. He didn’t show any mercy at all.

“”Okay, okay, okay. I’ll go back and get the identification card.”Yuan Yi put on her glasses again. Her mother had no choice but to return to the aircraft to get the identification card. ”

“Fortunately, Yuan Yi’s residence was not far from here. It only took about 15 minutes. ”

“”Captain Wu, let me show you the Identification Card.”Yuan Yi waved the identification card in front of Wu Han. “Can I go in now?” ”

“Wu Han took the id and scanned it according to the process. After the system finished scanning, Wu Han said, “Go in.” ”

“Yuan Yi walked inside. After a few steps, he turned back and looked at Wu Han. “Captain Wu, do you know how to Smile?” ”

Wu Han looked ahead expressionlessly as if he didn’t hear Yuan Yi.

“Seeing Wu Han like this, Yuan Yi shook his head helplessly and continued to walk inside. ”

“Soon, Yuan Yi arrived at the door of Qiu Di’s office and knocked on the door. ”

The door was pushed open from inside.

“Yuan Yi looked at the person who opened the door and said, “Secretary Zhou, I want to see miss. .” ”

“Secretary Zhou said, “Miss. . is having a meeting inside. Please wait a moment.” ”

“Okay.”Yuan Yi nodded. “How long will it be before it ends?”

“”About 15 minutes,”the secretary replied. ”

“Okay.”Yuan Yi immediately activated the communicator and told Qiu Changzhen the news.

Qiu Changzhen had been reading ye Zao’s information and frowned slightly.

It looked like him.

It was too similar!

The Girl in the information was at least 70% similar to that person.

Was it her?

“Thinking of this, Qiu Changzhen felt a sense of crisis. ”

“15 minutes passed quickly. After the meeting, Qiu Di walked out of the meeting room. ”

“As the only daughter of Qiu Chang Town, Qiu Di had been exceptionally outstanding since she was young. Her aura was very strong. ”

“She was only 25 years old, but she was already able to take charge of her own affairs. Her ability was even above Qiu Chang Town. ”

“”Yuan Yi, why are you here?”Seeing Yuan Yi, Qiu di frowned slightly. ”

“Yuan Yi stood up straight and saluted Qiu Di. “Eldest miss, the commander has something to ask of you. Please come with me.” ”

“Father? Why is Father Looking for me?”Qiu Di asked.

“Yuan Yi said, “I’m not too sure about the details. You’ll know when you arrive.” ”

“Qiu Di glanced at Yuan Yi, “Wait a moment.” ”
