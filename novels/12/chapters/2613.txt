“At this moment, old madam Wang suddenly opened her mouth and said with a smile, “I know, Zhengxuan. This is your girlfriend, right?” ”

“”Mom, don’t be like this. You’re scaring Cuihua.” ”

“Zhou cuihua immediately said, “It’s okay, it’s okay. Old people are always like this.” ”

“Boss Wang said a little embarrassedly, “My mom is just too excited. After all, I’ve been single for so many years.” ”

Boss Wang’s words made Zhou cuihua even more excited.

Although he didn’t personally admit anything.

But Zhou Cuihua could hear from his words that he had indirectly admitted their current relationship.

“In order to show that she was really filial and really liked the elderly, Zhou cuihua accompanied old madam Wang upstairs to chat for a long time. ”

Boss Wang brought Li hang downstairs to meet a few young people.

“After the banquet ended, boss Wang personally sent them back. ”

“When they got off the car, boss Wang seemed to have thought of something. “Hang Hang, wait a moment.” ”

“”What’s wrong, Uncle Wang?”Li Hang asked. ”

“Boss Wang said, “I almost forgot one thing. Here are ten music tickets. Take them.” ”

“”Thank you, Uncle Wang.”Li Hang took the tickets with both hands. “How much is the total? I’ll transfer it to you.” ”

“Boss Wang smiled and said, “We’re all on the same side. There’s no need to be so formal.” ”

“Zhou cuihua said from the side, “Although that’s what you said, Blood Brothers still have to settle scores! Zhengxuan, just tell hang!” ”

“”No need, no need. It’s just a small amount of money. Just treat it as my friends inviting Hang!”Boss Wang continued, “We’re a family! If you mention money again, I’ll be angry!” ”

“Zhou cuihua looked at Li Hang. “Hang Hang, why don’t you quickly thank your uncle Wang?” ”

“”Thank you, Uncle Wang.”Li hang immediately thanked her. ”

“You’re welcome.”

“Li hang continued, “Mom, aren’t you going to treat uncle Wang to a cup of tea?” ”

“”Yes, yes, yes. You See, I forgot about it.”Zhou cuihua continued, “I’m sharing a house with someone else. Zhengxuan, it’s fine as long as you don’t mind the mess at home.” ”

“”I don’t mind, I don’t mind! Why would I mind!” ”

“Li Hang said at the right time, “Then I’ll go back first.” ”

Zhou cuihua nodded. “You go back.”

“Boss Wang instructed, “Be careful on the road. Drive safely.” ”

“”Okay, uncle Wang.” ”

Zhou Cuihua brought boss Wang upstairs for tea.

“Although the living conditions in the neighborhood that Zhou Cuihua rented were not bad, it was still incomparable to a small house. ”

“However, boss Wang did not show any disdain on his face. ”

“Zhou cuihua rented a large bedroom, which was 30 square meters. ”

“”Zhengxuan, you take a seat first.”Zhou cuihua smiled and said, “I’ll pour you some tea. is black tea okay?” ”

“Yes.”Boss Wang nodded.

He quietly observed the environment of the rented house.

“Zhou cuihua must have cleaned the house before she went out, so the house was relatively clean and tidy. ”

“Soon, Zhou cuihua came over with tea. ”

“”Zhengxuan, have some tea. This is wild black tea that my hometown brought from home. You Can’t buy it outside.” ”

“Thank you.”Boss Wang took the Teacup with both hands.

“Zhou cuihua smiled and said, “I’ll lend you a word. A family doesn’t need to speak two languages.” ”

“”Yes, yes, yes.”Boss Wang continued, “Cuihua, I’ve met many people over the years, but you’re the most special one I’ve met.” ”

“Really?”Zhou cuihua asked.

Boss Wang nodded.

“Zhou cuihua said, “Actually, you’re the same. You’re the best man I’ve ever met.” ”

“Boss Wang was more handsome than Li Dalong, richer than Li Dalong, and more considerate than Li Dalong. ”

Zhou cuihua had already started the process. Why didn’t she get a divorce earlier so that she could meet boss Wang earlier!

“Boss Wang continued, “Do you know that there’s a saying that goes, ‘it’s too late to meet each other’?” ”

Zhou cuihua nodded. “Of course I know.”

“”The feeling I have for you is that it’s too late to meet each other,”boss Wang said. “I regret not meeting you earlier.” ”

“Zhou cuihua said very excitedly, “Me too. I have the same feeling for you too.” ”

It turned out that a true lover could really connect with his heart.
