“Okay.”

“Ye Zao nodded slightly and changed the route of the aircraft. Soon, the aircraft landed on the snowy ground. ”

They were about 200 meters away from the figure on the snowy ground.

“A gust of cold wind blew over, making people shiver involuntarily. ”

The temperature here was as low AS-280 degrees Celsius.

“Although she was wearing a winter suit, it still made people feel a bone-chilling cold. ”

“Cen Shaoqing first walked out of the aircraft, then stretched out his hand towards ye Zao and helped her down. “Be careful.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zao looked around. “It’s so cold.”

“Although she was a native of the s galaxy, she rarely came to the northwestern region. It would take a while for her to get used to the cold in the northwestern region. ”

One had to know that the coldest South Pole on earth was minus 90 degrees Celsius.

It was three times colder than the south pole here.

“Perhaps the man was hot-tempered, but Cen Shaoqing did not feel too cold. He lowered his head and zipped up ye Zao’s winter coat. Then, he took off the big scarf around his neck and wrapped it around ye Zao. ”

“Aren’t you cold?”Ye Zao asked.

“”No,”Cen Shaoqing said in a low voice. “This winter coat is very effective.” ”

“Then let’s go.”

“”Wait a minute,”Cen Shaoqing continued. ”

“What’s Wrong?”Ye Zhuo looked back and asked.

Cen Shaoqing half-squatted down. “Your shoelaces are untied.”

“As he spoke, he had already helped ye Zhuo tie his shoelaces. ”

“The two of them walked forward side by side. Ye Zhuo continued, “If that’s really uncle, remember to calm down. After all, we haven’t found the truth yet.” ”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Although two hundred meters was not far, the weather in the northwest region was too cruel. Not only was it very cold, but it was also accompanied by hurricanes. It took ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing three to four minutes to cover the distance that they could have covered in two minutes. ”

The man was lying on his side on the ground. He was wearing a white winter coat.

He looked to be in his forties or fifties.

“Although his eyes were closed, it was not difficult to tell that he was exactly the same as Cen Haifeng in the photo. ”

It was just that his facial features had some vicissitudes left behind by the passage of time.

Cen Shaoqing just stood there. No expression could be seen on his face.

He had once fantasized that one day he would be able to see his father again.

But he had never thought that this would be the scene when Father and son met.

“After so many years, things had changed. ”

“Ye Zhuo immediately walked over to save him. “Wake up, please wake up.” ”

“After shaking for a long time, CEN Haifeng still did not wake up. ”

Ye Zhuo turned to look at Cen Shaoqing. “Give me the water.”

Cen Shaoqing took out a cup of water.

Ye Zhuo took the cup and fed the hot water to Cen Haifeng.

The hot water entered his throat and CEN Haifeng slowly woke up. He slowly opened his eyes and the world in front of him became real. His five senses were also slowly recovering.

“Seeing that his condition had recovered a lot, ye zhuo fed him hot water again. ”

Gulp Gulp.

“This time, Cen Haifeng gulped down large mouthfuls, as if a thirsty traveler who was walking in the desert had suddenly found a source of water. ”

“After more than half of the hot water entered his stomach, Cen Haifeng’s vital signs gradually stabilized. ”

“Are you okay?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“Cen Hai Feng shook his head and looked around before he finally reacted, “Little girl, thank you for saving me.” ”

“Cen Hai Feng had always had a serious headache. This time, he came to the northwest region to dispel the forbidden technique in his body. ”

He kept feeling as if he had forgotten something very important.

“However, when he came to the northwest region, the patriarch of the ancient forbidden technique family told him that he did not have any forbidden technique on him. ”

“Helpless, Cen Haifeng could only go back. ”

“He came here secretly this time and didn’t bring his bodyguards and assistants. He didn’t expect that the weather in the northwest region was too harsh. In addition, he had a headache and fainted in the snow. ”

“If no one found him in the desolate northwest region, the consequences would be unimaginable. ”

“”You’re welcome.”Ye Zhuo continued, “Let me help you up first.” ”

“Okay.”Cen Haifeng nodded. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Let me do it.”Cen Shaoqing bent down slightly and helped CEN Haifeng up.

“Cen Haifeng’s footsteps were still a little unsteady, perhaps because he had just woken up. He half-leaned on Cen Shaoqing’s body and said, “Thank you.” ”

Cen Shaoqing pursed his lips and did not speak. His expression was cold.

“At this moment, although he was wearing a very ordinary human skin mask, his powerful aura was still there. ”

Cen Haifeng inexplicably felt that this young man by his side was very amiable.

“Even though he acted as if he was a thousand miles away from others, CEN Haifeng still felt very amiable. ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “It’s nothing. Our aircraft is nearby. Uncle, I don’t think you’re in a good condition right now. Why Don’t you come with us to the aircraft and rest for a while?” ”
