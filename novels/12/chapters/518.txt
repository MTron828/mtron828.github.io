“Seeing that Feng Qianhua liked it so much, Old Lady Lin asked with concern, “Did you make more stew for Qianhua?” ”

“Aunt Zhang nodded. “Don’t worry, I specially made more stew.” ”

“That’s good.”

...

At the Cen family home.

“Cen Shaoqing stood in front of the floor-to-ceiling window on the sixth floor, looking down at the ground. His gaze was somewhat profound, and his entire body emitted an aura that no one was allowed to enter. ” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Tomorrow was the Lin family’s family recognition banquet.

It would be a lie to say that he wasn’t nervous.

“After all, he had once been frivolous, but he had offended his future brother-in-law. ”

The air was playing Pleasant Buddhist music.

But Cen Shaoqing couldn’t calm down at all. He took out his phone and started searching: [ how to resolve the enmity between him and his brother-in-law? ]

“[ without knowing, what if he offended his future brother-in-law? ] ”

[ what does a 19-year-old boy like? ]

[ is a three-year-old child good at remembering things? ]

[ do children hold grudges? ]

“There was a reply below: [ Haha Brother, You’re dead meat! Whoever you offend, Go Offend Your Future brother-in-law! Let me tell you, children hold grudges the most! ] ”

“[ I’m just young, I’m Not Stupid! You offended me back then, I’ll definitely remember it! ] ”

“[ he abused his brother-in-law for a moment of pleasure, chasing his wife to the crematorium! ] ”

“[ F * ck! He even dared to offend his brother-in-law! Brother, you’re Amazing! ] ”

“[ chasing his wife is a long road, brother, you can do it! Remember to post the results when the time comes. ] ”

“Seeing these answers, Cen Shaoqing was a little upset. ”

“He wished he could go back to the time when he was 15 years old, slap away that stupid him, and then set up an incense table to worship Lin Ze. ”

Cen Shaoqing could only pray that his brother-in-law was magnanimous enough to forget about that matter.

Cen Shaoqing started to search again:

[ how do I curry favor with my future brother-in-law and father-in-law? ]

[ what kind of son-in-law does father-in-law like? ]

[ can father-in-law accept a son-in-law who is older than his daughter? ]

[ how do I become a son-in-law that everyone loves? ]

“At this moment, there was a knock on the door. ”

“Come in.”Cen Shaoqing turned around slightly and put his phone into his pocket. He twirled the prayer beads.

The door was pushed open.

“Old Mrs. Cen, who was wearing a piglet peppa t-shirt, walked in from outside. The old lady was not only wearing a piglet peppa t-shirt, she was also wearing slippers with piglet peppa on them. ”

“Grandma.”

“Old Mrs. Cen acknowledged and said with a kind look, “Shaoqing, it has been so long. Have you passed Yezi’s internship?” ”

Old Mrs. Cen could not wait to announce to everyone what an outstanding granddaughter-in-law she had.

Unfortunately.

“Cen Shaoqing had not passed his internship. The two of them had not announced their relationship yet, so she could not rashly announce it. ”

Internship?

CEN Shaoqing frowned without a trace.

“What he was worried about now was not his internship, but his father-in-law and brother-in-law. ”

“If he couldn’t pass the father-in-law and his brother-in-law, what could he do even if he passed the internship period? ”

“Not yet.”Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddha beads.

“”Not Yet?”Old Mrs. Cen couldn’t control her voice, and her expression changed instantly, “You’re a sand sculpture! Nothing! You haven’t even passed the internship period, and you still dare to be so leisurely! Don’t you know how popular Ye Zi Is?” ”

Cen Shaoqing rubbed his forehead. “It’s useless to be anxious about this kind of thing.”

“”Your grandmother was smart all her life, so how did she get a sand sculpture like you!”Old Mrs. Cen placed her hands on her hips. “You haven’t passed your internship yet, so don’t you know how to Sum Up Your Experience?” ”

Cen Shaoqing’s expression didn’t change. “Sum up what experience?”

“Of course it’s the experience of being in love!”Old Mrs. Cen paused. “Wait for me.”

“At this point, old Mrs. Cen turned around and walked downstairs. ”

“Not long after, old Mrs. Cen came back. ”

She was holding a stack of books in her hands.

“Old Mrs. Cen placed the books on the table. The first book on the table was president BA’s novel, “The overbearing president fell in love with me.”. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen patted the books, “See, these male protagonists in the books are your seniors! Don’t read those Buddhist scriptures all day long. Read more of these books that are useful to you! Look at how these seniors in the book pursue their wives! Look at you, then look at them!” ”

“When she said the last sentence, old Mrs. Cen had a look of disdain. ”

“”Look at the seniors in this book. In less than half a month, they’ve already confirmed their relationship with the female lead.” ”

“”This book is even more amazing! In less than three months, they’ve already received their marriage certificate!” ”

“And this one...”

“Old Mrs. Cen introduced each book to Cen Shaoqing one by one. Finally, she summarized her experience. “Actually, it’s very easy to become a qualified boyfriend. It can be summed up in six words.” ”
