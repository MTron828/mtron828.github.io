Translator: 549690339

“In the blink of an eye, only Chen Siyao and song Shiyu were left in the living room. ”

“Chen Siyao gulped and steadied herself. She took a few bold steps forward and placed the brown sugar ginger water on the coffee table. “Shiyu, drink it while it’s hot.” ”

“Seeing the fear in Chen Siyao’s eyes, song Shiyu looked down at the cat in his arms and continued, “Are you afraid of it?” ”

“Hearing this, Chen Siyao was delighted. ”

She noticed.

Song Shiyu actually noticed the change in her expression.

Would song Shiyu abandon it just because I’m afraid of cats? Or would he send it to a pet shop?

“Chen Siyao suppressed the excitement in her heart and said, “No, no.” ”

“”Since you’re afraid of cats, stay away from it. I’m also afraid that you’ll hurt it,”said song Shiyu indifferently, as if he was talking to a stranger. ”

“Chen Siyao was also stunned. She thought that song Shiyu would throw the cat away because of her, but he actually told her to stay away from the cat. ”

“Although she was a little surprised, Chen Siyao wasn’t sad. ”

“After all, the cat was song Shiyu’s pet, so it was normal for song Shiyu to Love Cats. ”

“Chen siyao smiled and continued, “Shiyu, you misunderstood. I’m not afraid of it. I’m not afraid at all.” ”

Song Shiyu didn’t expose Chen Siyao. He just looked at her and didn’t say anything else.

“Bai Jiayu, who was walking into the house, heard their conversation and shook his head helplessly. ”

“Although he had experienced love before, he still didn’t understand Chen Siyao’s love for Song Shiyu. ”

“For Love, Chen Siyao could give up everything. ”

Including pride and self-esteem.

This was something Bai Jiayu couldn’t do.

“Seeing Bai Jiayu come in, Chen Siyao smiled and looked up. “Jiayu, what do you want to eat for lunch? I’ll make it for you.” ”

“Bai Jiayu smiled and said, “I can eat whatever I want.” ”

“”Okay then,”chen siyao continued, “Then I’ll just do whatever I want.” ”

“Okay.”Bai Jiayu nodded.

Chen Siyao turned around and walked into the kitchen.

Bai Jiayu looked at song Shiyu. “Third brother.”

“”Mm,”song Shiyu replied. ”

“Bai Jiayu continued, “Third brother, will you marry and have children in the future?” ”

“”No,”song Shiyu said. ”

“Bai Jiayu peeled a piece of gum and put it in his mouth, then he said, “If, I mean if, if one day you want to get married and have children, you must give priority to siyao. I think Siyao is really a good wife and mother. Most importantly, she still likes you so much!” ”

“Chen Siyao didn’t go far. When she heard this, she paused and listened carefully to song Shiyu’s answer. ”

She was looking forward to it.

She was looking forward to song Shiyu’s answer. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“A moment later, song Shiyu said softly, “No, I will never get married and have children. Even if I do get married and have children one day, it won’t be with Chen Siyao.” ”

“Even if he was particular, he wouldn’t choose Chen Siyao. ”

“Hearing this, Bai Jiayu was stunned. Chen siyao, who was standing not too far away, was also stunned. ”

Her face was deathly pale.

She didn’t expect song Shiyu to say such a thing.

She even began to wonder why she had persisted for so many years.

“Bai Jiayu frowned slightly. “No Way, third brother. Siyao loves you so much. Aren’t you being a little too heartless to her? !” ”

“”Unrequited love doesn’t have no result.”Song Shiyu looked at Bai Jiayu and continued, “And love isn’t charity.” ”

Love was never charity.

“Because she was in the game, song Shiyu said those words. ”

“Outside the door, Chen Siyao was already in tears. ”

“In a moment, she wiped her tears and continued to walk to the kitchen. ”

“From the start, she had never planned to marry song Shiyu. She only wanted to protect song Shiyu. Now that she heard such an answer, what was the Big Deal? She was already mentally prepared, right? ”

“From the moment she fell in love with Song Shiyu, she had lost. What was the big deal about what she was going through now? ”

Chen Siyao came to the kitchen and began to cut and cook as if nothing had happened.

...

“After burning incense and worshipping Buddha from the temple, Ye Zhuo did not go home. Instead, he followed Cen Shaoqing to the Cen family manor to pay New Year’s greetings. ”

“On the first day of the New Year, other than Cen Yuyan, Cen Shaoqing’s other older sisters had all returned. ”

The living room was very lively.

“Seeing ye Zhuo return, the older sisters scrambled to give ye Zhuo red packets and gifts. ”

“Ye Zhuo could not reject their hospitality, so he could only accept them one by one. “Thank you, Big Sisters, Second Sisters, and third sisters. I wish the three of you a prosperous new year and all the best in the four seasons.” ”

“Cen Yueya smiled and said, “We’re all family, there’s no need to be so polite!” ”
