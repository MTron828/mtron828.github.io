“It was to remind song Shiyu that if it wasn’t for him back then, song Shiyu wouldn’t exist! ”

“In the past, song Shiyu would still pay for Old Master Chen’s words. ”

“But today, song Shiyu didn’t feel anything at all. ”

“”Shiyu?”Seeing that song Shiyu didn’t speak for a long time, Old Master Chen asked. ”

“Song Shiyu then continued, “Old Chen, thank you for your love. I really can’t afford it. To tell you the truth, if I can’t marry the person I want to marry, I’d rather be single for the rest of my life than suffer myself!” ”

The last sentence was a little too harsh.

“Song Shiyu had intended to say that. After all, Old Master Chen had already said it to such an extent. ” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“”Shiyu,”Old Master Chen also knew what song Shiyu meant. “Can you help me this one time! For the last time! It’s because I brought you back to spend the night when you were nine years old.” ”

“Song Shiyu had a bad temper to begin with, and Old Master Chen kept talking about it, so the anger in his eyes suddenly rose, he continued, “I took over the song family when I was twenty years old. I’ve helped the Chen Group many times over the years. I believe you should know that without me saying it!” ”

“Song Shiyu had never used such a tone to say anything. At this moment, Old Master Chen was a little confused. ”

What did song Shiyu Mean?

He didn’t agree?

Could it be that song Shiyu had already forgotten about his childhood? He had also forgotten that he had to repay the kindness of others?

“”Shiyu, I don’t quite understand what you mean,”Old Master Chen continued. ”

“”What you mean is that I no longer owe the Chen clan anything,”song Shiyu said straightforwardly. ”

He had already helped the Chen clan for eleven whole years!

“Old Master Chen looked at song Shiyu. At that moment, he felt that this young man was a stranger to him. ”

He was the child that he had watched grow up. How did he become like this after he grew up?

“If it had been the song Shiyu of the past, he would definitely not have rejected him! ”

He could even forget about saving his life. Song Shiyu was really capable!

Song Shiyu turned to look at the butler. “Go and get old Chen a cup of tea.”

“Although it sounded like he was getting a cup of tea, he was actually chasing him away! ”

Old Master Chen’s expression changed. His face was filled with self-mockery. “The threshold of the song family is getting higher and higher now. I have overestimated myself! Yaoyao is even more delusional!”

“After saying that, old master Chen turned to look at his assistant behind him. He gritted his teeth and said, “Let’s Go!” ”

“Yes.”The assistant immediately pushed Old Master Chen into his wheelchair.

“Song Shiyu said, “Butler Wu, send Old Master Chen Off.” ”

Butler Wu raised his feet and followed Old Master Chen and the others.

On the other side.

Chen Siyao was still at home waiting for good news from Old Master Chen.

Old Master Chen had already discussed the date of the engagement with her last night. It would be the 28th day of the next month.

The next day was the day of the wedding.

Chen Siyao looked at the almanac and felt that two months was a very suitable time.

She wanted to marry song Shiyu as soon as possible so that she wouldn’t have to wait too long.

“”Miss! Miss!”At that moment, the nanny’s voice sounded in the air. ”

“What’s Wrong?”Chen Siyao turned around.

“The nanny said excitedly, “Old master is back!” ”

Chen Siyao’s eyes lit up. “Really?”

“Of course it’s true!”

“Chen Siyao immediately ran downstairs. As expected, Old Master Chen was back. ”

“Chen Siyao was so excited that she ignored old master Chen’s expression. She ran over and said excitedly, “Grandpa, what did Shiyu Say?” ”

“Old Master Chen had personally come out. Song Shiyu had to repay the favor, so he would definitely be embarrassed to refuse. ”
