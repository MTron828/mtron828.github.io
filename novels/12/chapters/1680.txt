“The assistant was also very aggrieved. “President Ye, I told you, you were the one who said that you didn’t see any guests without an appointment!” ”

Only then did ye Sen remember that the assistant did come to look for him in the morning.

“But at that time, he was busy with the documents, and ye Shu called to urge him to get married, so he didn’t take this matter to heart. ”

“After all, there were quite a lot of people who came to see him every day! ”

But he didn’t expect that the person who came in the afternoon was gu deling!

“If he had known that this person was gu deling, even if he was busy, he would have gone down to have a cup of coffee with someone! ”

“But now, not only did he not treat anyone to coffee, he even put on the airs of a boss in front of people. ”

“Ye Sen regretted it too much. He put his things aside, picked up the car keys, and walked out of the office. ”

The assistant looked at Ye Sen in confusion.

Could it be that miss gu was special to Ye Sen?

“Soon, the car arrived at the hospital. ”

“Before entering the inpatient department, Ye Sen specially tidied up his clothes. After making sure that there were no problems, he walked to the entrance of the inpatient department. ”

Gu Dexin was staying in the single-room VIP ward.

“Standing in front of the ward door, Ye Sen was a little nervous. ”

He didn’t know if the incident in the morning had left a bad impression on gu dening.

“In a moment, the door opened. ”

The person who opened the door was gu dening.

“Seeing Ye Sen, he said in surprise, “Brother Ye.” ”

“Ye Sen organized his words in his mind, “Dening, thank you for the cold medicine. I was really too busy in the morning, so I didn’t go down to see you. I’m really sorry!” ”

“”It’s okay. Work is more important.”Gu De Ning smiled and said, “Come in quickly.” ”

“”Xiao Ye is here!”Gu de Xin, who was sitting on the bed, immediately put down her phone when she saw ye Sen. ”

“”Sister De Xin, are you feeling better now?” ”

“Much better.”Gu de Xin nodded.

Gu De Ning went to make tea for ye Sen.

“After staying in the ward for a while, Ye Sen suggested to leave. ”

Gu dening sent him downstairs.

The two chatted as they walked.

“Ye Sen looked at Gu dening out of the corner of his eye as he spoke, his heart beating a little fast. ”

“He felt that he definitely liked gu dening, but he was afraid that he would be rude to her. ”

“If Gu dening didn’t like him, then they wouldn’t even be friends anymore? ” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“At this moment, Ye Sen thought of a joke on the internet. He looked up at the sky and said, “Dening.” ”

“Okay.”Gu dening looked up at him.

“Ye Sen continued, “Look at the beautiful moonlight tonight.” ”

Gu dening adjusted her glasses and looked at the sky seriously. “Is there a moon tonight?”

It was cloudy in the capital today. The Sky was dark. There was no moon.

The so-called beautiful moonlight tonight was actually a confession.

It meant that I like you.

But Gu dening was busy with all kinds of medical experiments. How could she know the meaning of this sentence!

“Hearing this, Ye Sen’s heart turned cold. ”

Was Gu dening giving him a way out?

Or did gu dening not know the meaning of this sentence at all?

“Ye Sen was very nervous, but he did not show it on his face. He smiled and said, “I was joking with you!” ”

“GU dening said, “This joke is so cold.” ”

“Ye Sen continued, “Don’t worry, I have other jokes. There was a man whose surname was tie. He did not grow hair since he was young. May I ask what disease he has?” ”

“What disease?”Gu dening asked curiously.

“Ye Sen said, “You really don’t Know?” ”

“I don’t know!”Gu dening shook her head.

“Ye Sen smiled and said, “Of course, there’s nothing wrong with old tie!” ”

“PFFT!”Gu dening laughed out loud.

On the other side.

Cen’s base.

Professor Feng was doing an analysis in front of the laboratory table when his phone suddenly vibrated.

“Professor Feng took out his phone and took a look. In a split second, he deleted the message and walked out of the laboratory. ”

“At the same time, director Ma also walked over from the opposite side. ”

“Professor Feng.”Director ma greeted Professor Feng with a smile.

“Professor Feng nodded. “Director Ma, are you busy?” ”

“Yes.”

“Although the two of them didn’t talk much, they understood everything from each other’s eyes. ”

Professor Feng came to Tang Mi’s office and knocked on the door. “Tang Mi.”

Tang mi put down the test tube in her hand and walked over to open the door. “Professor Feng.”

“Professor Feng nodded. “Tang Mi, I have a problem here and I need to find Miss Ye. Did Miss ye say when she would be back?” ”

“I don’t know either.”Tang mi scratched her head. “Miss ye seems to have accompanied her friend to participate in the college entrance examination. She might be back after the college entrance examination.”

The college entrance examination ended on the 8th.
