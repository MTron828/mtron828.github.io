“Also, Ye Sen’s financial situation was very good. Gu dening marrying Ye Sen, there was no need to worry about whether the man was interested in Gu Dening’s money. ”

“Moreover, Ye Sen was also pretty good-looking. ”

“His facial features were exquisite, and he was 1.85 meters tall. ”

“If Gu dening could become a couple with him, it could be considered a man and a woman’s beauty. ”

“The more Gu Dexin looked at Ye Sen, the more she liked this brother-in-law. ”

Ye Sen was a little embarrassed by Gu Dening’s words.

The reason why he didn’t take any action was that he didn’t know if gu dening had a good impression of him too.

“When it came to relationships, if they didn’t expose the truth, they could still be friends. Once the truth was exposed, they wouldn’t even have the chance to be friends. ”

That was why he didn’t dare to confess.

“Now that he heard Gu Dexin say that, apart from feeling embarrassed, Ye Sen was more excited and in disbelief. ”

It turned out that they had always liked each other. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Seeing that ye Sen didn’t say anything, Gu Dexin was a little anxious. “Xiao Ye, did you hear what I Said?” ”

Ye Sen finally reacted and nodded. “I did.”

“”It’s good that you heard it.”Gu dexin continued to ask, “Then when are you going to confess to De Ning? Let me tell you, our De Ning is very popular. Just last night, someone even came to give her flowers!” ”

“Who?”Ye Sen asked nervously.

“”I don’t know who it is,”gu dexin continued, “But he is also a good-looking person. But don’t worry, our De Ning didn’t agree to it!” ”

Ye Sen heaved a sigh of relief.

“At this moment, gu dening walked over with a cup in her hand. “Brother Ye, have some tea.” ”

Ye Sen hurriedly stood up and took the cup with both hands. “Thank you.”

“GU dening continued, “Sister, what were you talking about with Brother Ye just now? You’re acting so mysterious!” ”

“Gu dexin smiled and said, “It’s a secret.” ”

Gu dening was a little speechless. “What’s worth keeping a secret?”

“”Anyway, I can’t let you know!”Gu dexin continued to ask, “Xiao Ye can already be discharged from the hospital. When Can I be discharged? I’m bored to death staying in the hospital all day long!” ”

“You can’t be discharged yet with your condition. We’ll have to observe you for a few more days!”Gu Dening said.

“Gu Dexin was a little speechless and said, “You like to make a fuss over nothing!” ”

“”Brother-in-law left you in my care, so I have to be responsible for you!” ”

Gu Dexin’s in-laws had already passed away. She had an only son who was studying in C nation. Her husband was a political figure and was usually very busy. He was often elusive.

“This time, when Gu Dexin was sick, he did not have time to take care of her, so he could only take care of Gu Dening. ”

Gu Dexin pursed her lips. “Your brother-in-law likes to make a fuss!”

“After sitting in the ward for a while, Ye Sen suggested to leave. ”

“Gu dexin hurriedly said, “Dexin, it’s inconvenient for me to move. Help me send Xiao Ye off.” ”

“Okay.”Gu Dexin nodded and followed ye Sen’s footsteps. “I’m just going to visit Miss Ye.”

The two of them talked as they walked.

Ye Sen was a little distracted.

Gu Dexin’s words kept echoing in his mind.

Did Gu decing really have him in her heart?

Ye Sen was a little nervous and secretly glanced at Gu decing.

“Gu decing asked curiously, “Brother Ye, why are you looking at me?” ”

“Ye Sen quickly denied, “I’m not looking at you, I’m looking over there! Look at that person’s eyes, there seems to be eye droppings.” ”

Gu dening tilted her head and saw a woman dressed fashionably and exquisitely.

“”There’s no eye wax. You must be mistaken,”gu dening said. ”

“Ye Sen continued, “Look carefully. The corners of her eyes are glowing! From the looks of it, she has quite a severe case of eye wax.” ”

Only someone who had a bad case of eye wax would have such a thick eye wax.

Gu dening laughed softly. “That’s not eye wax. That’s a type of eye makeup. She just applied pearl light on her eyes.”

“As expected of a straight man. Even with such good-looking eye makeup, Ye Sen thought it was eye droppings. ”

No wonder he was still single.

“”AH? !”Ye Sen touched his nose awkwardly. “I, I don’t know.” ”

“Not long after, they arrived at the ward. ”

Ye Sen pushed the door open and entered.

Ye Zao sat on the sofa and looked at his phone.

“Miss Ye.”Gu De Ning walked over.

“Ye Zhuo put down his phone. “Sister dening, I’ve said it many times. Just Call Me Zhuozhuo.” ”

How could ye Zhuo not see through Ye Sen’s feelings towards Gu Dening.

“Therefore, she had said it many times in front of Gu Dening, asking gu dening to call her by her name. ”
