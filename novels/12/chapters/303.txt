Today was the first time ye Sen had asked Bai Wei out for dinner.

Ye Sen had specially arrived ten minutes earlier.

“Not long after, Bai Wei arrived as well. ”

She had always been a punctual person.

“Mr. Ye.”

“Miss Bai.”Ye Sen stood up and pulled out a chair for Bai Wei.

“Bai Wei smiled. “Thank you, Mr. Ye.” ”

“Ye Sen said, “It’s too strange for us to come and go like this. You can just call me by my name.” ”

“”You’re a few years older than me, so I’ll call you brother Ye.” ”

“Ye Sen nodded. “Sure, no problem.” ”

“After saying that, Ye Sen handed the menu to Bai Wei. “Ladies first. You Order.” ”

“Bai Wei smiled and said, “I’ll just have a vegetable salad. You can order the rest, Brother Ye.” ”

“You’ll just have a vegetable salad?”Ye Sen asked.

“Bai Wei nodded. “A dance teacher has to maintain his figure. There’s nothing I can do.”Bai Wei was a folk dance teacher, so her image and temperament were very good. ”

“Ye Sen said, “Then it’s really hard to do your job.” ”

“Bai Wei smiled and said, “It’s not easy to do all kinds of jobs.” ”

Ye Sen nodded and agreed with Bai Wei.

“Although Bai Wei only ordered a vegetable salad,. ”

Ye Sen still ordered a table full of dishes.

“They had agreed that he would treat her, and he couldn’t let her eat grass. ”

“But Bai Wei was a person with a strong sense of self-control. From the beginning to the end, she only ate the vegetable salad in front of her. She only ate one or two mouthfuls of the other dishes. ”

Ye Sen was very surprised.

It was the first time he had seen such a self-disciplined girl.

“After eating, Ye Sen went to the bar to pay the bill. ”

“Which table are you at?”

“Ye Sen said, “Table 71.” ”

“The cashier operated the computer and said, “Table 71 has already paid the bill.” ”

“Already paid the Bill?”Ye Sen frowned slightly. “Who bought it?”

The cashier tiptoed and looked at the middle of the restaurant. “It’s the lady in the plaid dress.”

Who else but Bai Wei was wearing the plaid dress?

“Thinking about it, Bai Wei must have paid while she was in the bathroom. ”

Ye Sen did not expect Bai Wei to take the initiative to pay.

“He had a good impression of Bai Wei, and at this moment, it was even better. ”

“He came to the seat. “Bai Wei, we agreed that I would pay. How could I let you pay! I have already transferred the money to your wechat.” ”

“Bai Wei smiled and said, “Anyway, it’s just a treat. It doesn’t matter who pays. At most, you can just invite them back next time. I won’t accept the money.” ”

“Then it’s a deal. I’ll definitely invite them back next time!”

Bai Wei nodded. “No problem. I’ll remember it for you.”

“Ye Sen looked at his watch and said, “Let’s go watch a movie while we still have time.” ”

“Bai Wei hesitated for a moment, then nodded. “Sure.” ”

“With that, the two of them walked to the cinema on the third floor. ”

...

Ye Zhuo accepted the old lady’s invitation.

“In the world she lived in in her previous life, all the islands and oceans had been contaminated by various nuclear bomb experiments. The seawater had become stagnant water, and the marine life had ceased to exist. ”

She had only seen the original appearance of the ocean on television.

“She had been in this world for so long, and although Yunjing was considered a coastal city, she had not gone to the seaside to play once. ”

Tomorrow was the departure time.

Ye Zhuo planned to go shopping and buy some things that she needed.

First of all.

Bathing suits and sunglasses were essential.

“There were also beach shoes, Big Straw Hats... ”

“As Ye Zao walked, he wrote down the things he wanted to buy on his phone. ”

“Ye Zao!”

A pleasant male voice suddenly sounded behind him.

Ye Zao looked back slightly and saw Li Boyang walking towards her. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Li Boyang did not expect to see ye Zao here today.

He had a high score of 688 in the college entrance examination and had already received the admission letter from Qinghua University.

Li Boyang regretted his words. Why didn’t he bring the admission letter with him when he left the house.

“If he brought it with him, he could take this opportunity to confess to ye Zao with the letter. ”

“But even if he didn’t bring it with him, this matter couldn’t be delayed. ”

He had to confess to ye Zao as soon as possible.

“Ye Zao.”Li Boyang jogged to ye Zao’s side.

“What’s Wrong?”Ye Zao’s brows were still furrowed.

“Li Boyang continued, “I scored 688 points in the college entrance examination and have been accepted by Qing Hua University.” ”

“Ye Zao’s expression was calm. “Oh, Congratulations.” ”

Li Boyang was stunned.

Why was ye Zao’s reaction so calm?

688 points!

He was ranked 89th in the entire city!

There were tens of thousands of college entrance examinees in Yun Jing. How many people would be able to get such a high score like him?
