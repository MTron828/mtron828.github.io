Translator: 549690339

“Aren’t you going to stay here for the New Year?”Old Mrs. Cen asked.

Bai Shu shook her head. “There’s a big family here! What’s wrong with me staying here for the New Year?”

“That’s fine.”Old Mrs. Cen nodded. “I’ll get the housekeeper to book a flight ticket for you.”

On the other side.

At the airport.

“Although it was already midnight, the airport was still brightly lit.”

Cen Shaoqing came to the airport.

There weren’t many people.

Most of them were playing with their phones.

“Cen Shaoqing was the only one holding a buddha bead in his hand and looking forward with a serious face. He stood out among the crowd and exuded a noble and cold aura, which made people feel intimidated.”

One o’clock. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The plane landed on time.

“Because there was a certain distance between the landing point and the exit, they needed to take a 10-minute shuttle bus. Therefore, when ye Zhuo came out of the airport, it was already 1:15.”

“Here!”She saw Cen Shaoqing waving at her as she walked to the entrance.

“Ye Zhuo pulled her suitcase and walked over quickly while answering the phone. “Okay, Grandma Cen. You should sleep early. I saw Cen Shaoqing at the airport.””

“Good night.”

“Grandma called?”Cen Shaoqing asked after she hung up the phone.

“Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Yes, by the way, when did you arrive?””

“I just arrived.”Cen Shaoqing took the suitcase from her hand. He held the suitcase with one hand and held her hand with the other. “Did you eat on the plane? Are You Hungry?”

“”A little.”Ye Zhuo continued, “I’ve been in C Nation for a week. I really miss our chafing dish. Shall we go for chafing dish later?””

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“The two of them talked as they walked. Soon, they reached the door.”

“”Wait a minute,”Cen Shaoqing suddenly said.”

“What’s Wrong?”Ye Zhuo looked back slightly.

“It’s snowing outside. It’s very cold. Put on your coat.”Cen Shaoqing took out the down jacket that he had prepared earlier.

“It’s okay. I’m just walking a little. I’m wearing an air-conditioned jacket.”Ye Zhuo said.

“”You don’t have to worry about it,”Cen Shaoqing said as he wrapped the down jacket around ye Zao.”

Ye Zao suddenly thought of something.

‘your father thinks you’re cold.’

“Ever since he got together with Cen Shaoqing, ye Zao felt like he had an old father.”

“After putting on the down jacket, Cen Shaoqing tied a scarf around ye Zao and put on a hat. Looking at ye Zao who was wrapped tightly, CEN Shaoqing was satisfied. He held ye Zao’s hand again. “Let’s go.””

“You asked me to wear so much. Why are you only wearing so little?”Ye Zao asked.

“I’m a man. I can resist the cold. You’re a little girl.”

“”You’re sexist,”ye Zao said.”

“”I’m not,”Cen Shaoqing said.”

“You’re very...”

“Before ye Zao could finish his sentence, his red lips were covered by a thin lip. A strong hand hooked around her waist. The sky was covered with snow. The two of them hugged and kissed. The scene was so romantic that it was like they were filming an idol drama.”

A few minutes later.

Cen Shaoqing moved her lips away and kissed the corner of her mouth. He was a little out of breath.

“What are you doing?”

Cen Shaoqing looked at her with a serious expression. “I read in the book that the best way to stop a woman from crying and talking is to kiss her.”

“What nonsense book.”Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly.

“”Grandma gave it to me.”CEN Shaoqing continued, “There are 108 ways to chase a wife from the CEO and love your wife like your life romance novels. The ways to chase a wife are similar.”Through these romance novels.., cen Shaoqing could be said to have benefited a lot during this period of time!”

“Ye Zhuo said, “Grandma Cen still reads these kinds of books?””

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Don’t underestimate her.”

“”I didn’t expect Grandma Cen to be so trendy. She even reads romance novels.”Ye Zhuo continued, “You’re not allowed to learn bad things from books.”She also read romance novels. Other than the male protagonist who was devoted to love, there were also many negative teaching materials, some of the male protagonists appeared and read a book of criminal law.”

“”I know,”Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips lightly opened. “Mr. Shen, who dug his heart and lungs out, and Mr. Fu, who killed half of the female protagonist’s entire family, and crown prince Li, who killed the female protagonist’s entire family, are all negative teaching materials for me.””

“”Tsk,”ye zhuo smiled and said, “I didn’t expect you to read so much!””

“”MM-HMM.”CEN Shaoqing continued, “Not only did I read a lot, but I also learned a lot of skills.””

“What skills?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly. He was a little curious about the skills that could be learned from romance novels.

“Cen Shaoqing did not know what he had thought of, but it was very rare that his ears were slightly red. “It’s said in the books that between husband and wife, less talking and more doing is the foundation of Family Harmony.””
