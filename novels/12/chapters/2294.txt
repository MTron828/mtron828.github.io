“The capital?”Elder Bai asked.

“Yes.”Bai Jingshu nodded.

“She was very nervous right now. If her grandfather didn’t support her being with Lin Ze, perhaps no one would. ”

“After saying that, elder Bai didn’t say anything for a long time. He looked into the distance with a meaningful gaze. ”

“Grandfather?”Bai Jingshu called out.

Old Master Bai finally reacted and turned to look at Bai Jingshu. “What’s Wrong?”

“Bai Jingshu continued, “Grandfather, he and I are truly in love. I hope that you can help us.” ”

“Hearing that, Old Master Bai laughed out loud. “When did grandfather say that we can’t Help You?” ”

“Does that mean that grandfather has agreed to let us be together?”Bai Jingshu’s face was full of surprise.

“Elder Bai did not directly answer Bai Jingshu’s question. Instead, he asked, “What’s your character like, young man?” ” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“”There’s no problem with your character. Don’t worry about that,”Bai Jingshu said. ”

“Elder Bai turned to look at Bai Jingshu. “As long as it’s not the second Chen Yaosheng, grandfather will give you his blessing.”. ”

“”Grandfather, thank you!”Bai Jingshu was very excited. She did not expect her grandfather to agree to her and Lin Ze’s matter so quickly. ”

“After saying that, Bai Jingshu continued, “It just so happens that he’s in the S Galaxy Now. Shall I bring him to meet you?” ”

“”No need.”Elder Bai waved his hand. He had his own thoughts. “Just tell me his name and his family background.”As for his character, he wanted to personally take the test. ”

“No matter what, he could not let Bai Jingshu meet a second Chen Yaosheng. ”

Bai Jingshu nodded and started talking about Lin Ze’s family environment.

“Hearing this, elder Bai looked up in surprise. “You said he’s Miss Ye’s brother?” ”

“Yes.”

“Elder bai continued, “Why do I remember someone introducing him to Bai Mo before?” ”

“If it was someone else, it would be fine. Bai Jingshu and Bai Mo were cousins after all. If the two of them got entangled, it was inevitable that people would gossip about them. ”

“Furthermore, elder Bai did not want Bai Jingshu to be deceived. ”

“There was such a thing.”Bai Jingshu did not hide it. “They just got to know each other and did not actually develop.”

“Bai Mo and Lin Ze had not started, so Bai Jingshu felt that she did not need to bother about such things. ”

“”Did Lin Ze tell you this, or did you ask him yourself?”Elder Bai asked. ”

“Bai Jingshu said, “He told me himself.” ”

“On the night of his successful confession, Lin Ze had told her about his personal situation, including the few girls he had met in his life and the time he had been tricked. ”

“Although it was only the first day they had met, Lin Ze felt that the most important thing for them to do when they were together was to be honest. ”

Elder Bai nodded. “How long have you been with him?”

“”More than three months,”Bai Jingshu replied. ”

“”Three months isn’t enough to get to know a person completely.”Elder Bai stroked his beard, then, he said, “Jingshu, you should be with him first. Girls need to learn how to protect themselves. If he makes excessive demands, you have to reconsider whether he’s the person you should entrust your life to.” ”

Girls were always at a disadvantage when it came to matters between men and women.

“As the elder of the provincial party committee, grandfather Bai, who was Bai Jingshu’s grandfather, naturally did not want to see Bai Jingshu suffer. ”

“After he finished speaking, grandfather Bai continued, “Take Chen Yaosheng as an example. Before he revealed his true colors, do you also think that he’s the person you should entrust your life to?” ”

“Yes.”

“”That’s why, Jingshu, a girl should never trust anyone so easily. This world is definitely much crueler than you can imagine.”Elder Bai had experienced many things that no one had ever experienced before, he hoped that Bai Jingshu would be able to have a smooth life for the rest of her life. It was fine to be deceived once, but it must not happen again. ”

“Bai Jingshu nodded, she continued, “Grandfather, I will definitely keep an eye out, but please believe in Lin Ze. By the way, didn’t I tell you last time that someone came to save me in time for Chen Yaosheng’s incident? If it wasn’t for that person, I might have... “... “...”the rest of her words.., went without saying. ”

“Based on the situation at that time, if Lin Ze had not come in time, how could she still be the person she was now? ”

“Elder Bai was stunned and asked, “That person is Lin Ze?” ”

“Yes.”Bai Jingshu nodded. “It’s him.”
