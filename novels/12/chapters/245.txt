“The Auntie looked at Ye Shu, then she said, “Big Sister, my surname is Lan. You can just call me big sister Lan. Don’t worry, I will definitely not harm you! “The person I introduced to you has a house, a car, and a pretty face. If you marry him, you don’t have to do anything in the future. You just have to bear his child and take care of him at home!” ”

Ye Shu rejected her. “I really don’t need it.”

Sister Lan felt that ye Shu was quite arrogant.

“Although she was pretty, she was already married. How could a married woman compare to an unmarried girl? ”

It was already good enough that her brother didn’t mind her being married for the second time!

What else could she be picky about!

No wonder her man didn’t want her!

She deserved to be a widow!

“Although sister Lan thought so in her heart, her face was still smiling, and her words and words were still trying to get close to Ye Shu. ”

Her brother had been single for more than ten years.

“As an older sister, she had always felt guilty. If she could take this opportunity to talk to him about a wife, she could also fulfill her parents’wish. ” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

711 convenience store.

“Because the examination venue was nearby, there were people everywhere in 711. They even had to queue up to pay. ”

“Ye Sen picked up three umbrellas and three bottles of mineral water. Just as he was about to pay the bill, he suddenly saw a familiar person on the opposite shelf. ”

It was the young woman he met last time.

“”Hello, we meet again.”Ye Sen walked directly in front of her. ”

“The young woman was stunned for a moment before she reacted. “Oh, it’s you.” ”

The two of them walked to the cash register and lined up.

“Ye Sen smiled and said, “You paid for me last time. I’ll pay for you this time.” ”

“”No need, thank you.”The young woman declined politely. ”

“Ye Sen continued, “Don’t worry. Even if I pay you, I’ll help you the next time I meet someone who needs help in the convenience store.” ”

“The young woman smiled and said, “In that case, I won’t stand on ceremony.” ”

“No need to stand on ceremony.”Ye Sen directly paid the money.

“Walking out of the convenience store, Ye Sen continued, “Are you also here to send your child off for the College Entrance Exam?” ”

The young woman was stunned for a moment. “AH? I don’t have children yet!”

“”I’m sorry, I said something wrong. You’re so young, you shouldn’t be married yet, right?”Ye Sen asked. ”

The young woman nodded. “Yes.”

“Ye Sen reached out his hand to her. “Hello, my name is ye Sen. I’m Mu Ye, from the forest. If you don’t mind, you can make friends with me.” ”

“My name is Bai Wei. I’m White and Rose.”Bai Wei reached out and held ye Sen’s hand.

“Ye Sen had a good first impression of Bai Wei, so he asked tentatively, “Why don’t you add me on wechat?” ”

“The young woman hesitated for a moment, then nodded. “Okay.” ”

The two of them added each other on wechat.

“According to the wechat information, Bai Wei was 29 years old this year. ”

“Ye Sen casually browsed through her wechat moments. From the looks of it, she was probably single. ”

“Ye Sen continued, “My niece is taking the college entrance exam over there. It’s almost over. I’ll go over first. I’ll treat you to a meal when I have time.” ”

Bai Wei smiled and nodded. “You go ahead.”

“After saying goodbye to Bai Wei, Ye Sen jogged over to the exam hall. However, as soon as he reached the exam hall, bean-sized raindrops fell from the sky. ”

“Sis! Here’s an umbrella.”Ye Sen handed an umbrella to Ye Shu.

“Ye Shu smiled and took the umbrella. “It’s a good thing that you bought this umbrella in time. Otherwise, we would have been caught in the rain.” ”

“Sister Lan, who was beside her, quickly came over. “I didn’t bring an umbrella. Sister, let’s squeeze in.” ”

“Ye Shu actually didn’t like sister Lan, but she couldn’t refuse her. She could only smile and say, “Sure, this umbrella is big enough!” ”

“At this moment, the bell suddenly rang. ”

The exam was over.

The parents who were originally very calm were no longer calm. All of them were looking forward to it.

Because it was raining.

“Therefore, the children were all running out. ”

Ye Sen saw ye Zao’s figure in the crowd at the first moment and hurriedly ran over. “Zao Zao!”

“Uncle.”

“”Quickly open the umbrella.”Ye Sen smiled and said, “You didn’t let your mother and I wait for you outside back then. If it weren’t for us, you would have been drenched in the rain now!” ”

“Big Sister Lan was also looking for her son in the crowd. When she saw ye Sen Pick Up Ye Zhuo, she asked curiously, “Big sister, is that Your Daughter?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Shu nodded.

“Big Sister Lan said in surprise, “My God! Your Daughter is so beautiful!” ”

No wonder her academic results were not good. She spent all her effort on dating!
