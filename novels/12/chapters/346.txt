“Chapter 347: 108: The Smart Big Scorch, just break up, CEO’s wife Chauness! 7”

Translator: 549690339

“When two people like this stood together, even if they didn’t do anything, they could still form a beautiful scenery. ”

Ye Sen frowned slightly. He had seen this man before.

His name was Cen Shaoqing.

Cen Shaoqing definitely had bad intentions towards ye Scorch!

“Otherwise, why would he be so attentive towards ye Scorch? And he would always appear by Ye Zao’s side? ”

Handsome and rich men were all bad people!

They were irresponsible and had no sense of responsibility!

He could not allow ye Zao to be deceived by such a big pig trotter!

Ye Sen ignored Cen Shaoqing and walked directly to ye Zao’s side. “Zao Zao!”

“Uncle.”

“Cen Shaoqing followed and called out, “Mr. Ye.” ”

“Ever since he had met Ye Sen the last time, Cen Shaoqing knew that ye Zao’s uncle did not like him. ”

“Moreover, from ye Sen’s eyes, it could be seen that he was full of hostility towards him. ”

“Cen Shaoqing’s journey was smooth sailing. No matter who saw him, they had to respectfully address him as CEN fifth master. He had never met someone who hated him so much. ”

Cen Shaoqing narrowed his eyes. A faint light flashed in his deep eyes.

“Ye Sen casually nodded at Cen Shaoqing and then looked at ye Zao. “Zao Zao, where are you going?” ”

“Ye Zao said, “Fifth brother and I are going out for some business.” ”

“”What business do the two of you have?”Ye Sen frowned and pulled ye Zao to the side. He whispered, “Zao Zao, you must protect yourself well! You must not fall for the hoof of the pig! Call me if there’s anything!” ”

Ye Shu had been deceived by the well-dressed hoof of the pig back then.

“Although ye Zao was very powerful, in the end, she was only a nineteen-year-old child. ”

Her feelings were even more blank.

A person like Cen Shaoqing could tell at a glance that there was no lack of women around him.

He was afraid that ye Zao would not be able to withstand Cen Shaoqing’s flirting.

“Ye Zao nodded. “Uncle, don’t worry. I know how to protect myself. Moreover, Cen Shaoqing is a monk. You Don’t have to worry about problems that won’t happen at all.” ”

“Ye Sen said speechlessly, “Have you seen a few monks with hair on their heads?” ”

Monks?

How many people of noble birth would want to become a monk?

“Was it the bird’s nest abalone, big lobster, or the game world? ”

“They were both men, but ye Sen had long noticed that Cen Shaoqing was looking at ye Zao in a strange way! ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Don’t worry. I can assure you that Cen Shaoqing is really not that kind of person.” ”

“Ye Sen glanced at Cen Shaoqing, his eyes filled with vigilance. “In short, you have to be careful. Don’t let the Pig Trotter succeed.” ”

“”Yes, I understand.”Ye Zao nodded. ”

Ye Sen instructed ye Zao for a while more before letting ye Zao follow Cen Shaoqing.

They got into the car.

Cen Shaoqing took the initiative to speak. “Uncle... seems to have a misunderstanding about me?”

“Ye Zhuo said, “Don’t worry, I’ve already explained it to him.” ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and did not say anything more.

“Not long after, the car arrived at the CEN group’s building. ”

Ye Zhuo followed Cen Shaoqing all the way to the company and entered the CEO’s private elevator.

“Just as the two of them entered the elevator, the company’s wechat group exploded. ”

One had to know that Cen Shaoqing was famous for not getting close to women. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

His office was on the 23rd floor.

“From the 20th floor onwards, there were no female employees. ”

“Even the secretaries, assistants, and bodyguards around him were all men. ”

“After so many years, this was the first time they saw the opposite sex around Cen Shaoqing. ”

“[ I just saw a little girl beside master five! I don’t know if she’s our future CEO’s wife, but she’s super beautiful! She’s perfect for master five! ] ”

[ CEO’s wife? Didn’t you say that our master five has already seen through the mortal world? ]

“[ jpg ] even though he only managed to get a side view, his looks are really too good! His temperament is also very good. If he debuts, he’ll definitely dominate the entertainment industry! ] ”

This photo woke up a group of people.

[ CEO’s wife is hammered! ]

[ CEO’s wife is so beautiful. This Side View is amazing! ]

[ oh my God! Master Five is finally enlightened. I thought master five would really become a monk! ]

[ F * ck! These legs are so long and thin! ]

[ the CEO’s wife is Super Nice! ]

...

On the other side.

Ye Sen drove to the place where he had made an appointment with Lin Ze.

“Just as he parked the car, he saw Lin ze walking over. “Uncle Ye.” ”

“Ah Ze.”

Lin Ze was very happy to see ye Sen. He gave him a big hug.

“It was strange. Lin Ze was usually a very cold person. Other than his father and grandmother, he did not have a very close relationship with his uncles and aunts. ”

“However, he treated ye Sen differently. When he saw Ye Sen, he could not help but want to get close to him. ”

“Ye Sen continued, “Ah Ze, have you heard from your mother?” ”

Lin Ze shook his head.

“It was already the eighth day. He would be returning to Beijing in two days, but he still had nothing. ”

Ye Sen patted him on the shoulder. “Don’t be discouraged. We’ll find her in a day.”

“Okay.”Lin Ze nodded.

“Ye Sen continued, “There’s a restaurant over there. Shall we talk while we eat?” ”

“Okay.”Lin Ze nodded.

“The two of them walked into the restaurant. Lin Ze asked curiously, “Uncle Ye, do you have children?” ”

“No.”Ye Sen shook his head. “Your Uncle Ye is still single.”

“Hearing this, Lin Ze looked at him in surprise. ”

“Ye Sen smiled and said, “Why? Do you want to introduce a girlfriend to your Uncle Ye?” ”

“Lin Ze quickly shook his head. “No, no.” ”

“In a short while, the dishes were served. The two of them chatted as they ate, ye Sen continued, “Ah Ze, since your grandmother knows about your mother, you have to think of a way to get some information out of her. Otherwise, this sea of people has no information at all. It’s really too difficult to find a person!” ”

Lin Ze Sighed.”... My grandmother really hates my mother.”

“Yesen wanted to help Lin Ze, “Then what’s the situation in your family right now? Does your grandma know that you came to look for your mom this time? And your dad, your dad should know more about your mom’s situation than your grandma. Why Don’t you ask your dad?” ”

“Although he had known Lin Ze for some time, Yesen knew nothing about Lin Ze’s family. ”

Just a rough idea. Linze lost his mother when he was a kid.

I have a difficult grandmother at home.

And a father that Lyndsey never mentioned.

“”The situation in our family is very complicated.”Lin Ze took a sip of soda, he continued, “When I was born, my father had a very serious car accident and lost a leg. Now, whenever the weather is bad, he will have severe phantom limb pain. The car accident also brought him a sequela of memory loss. Occasionally, he will lose control of himself... “...”. “...” ”

“At this point, Lin Ze seemed to have suddenly remembered something, he continued, “Around March or April last year, my father’s spirit suddenly improved. He should have remembered many things during that time and even came to Yun Jing. However, a few days after he returned from Yun Jing, his condition suddenly became worse. From then on, he stayed in the sanatorium almost every day.” ”
