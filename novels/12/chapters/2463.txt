Chapter 2464: 517: it wasn’t bragging! 1

Translator: 549690339

It wasn’t bragging to say that Chen Siyao was outstanding.

“As a standard daughter of a wealthy family, Chen Siyao was proficient in zither, chess, calligraphy, and painting. She was proficient in three foreign languages. Although she couldn’t be considered outstanding since she was young, she was definitely not the worst. ”

“She was slightly famous in the socialite circle, and there were quite a few families that wanted to marry into the Chen family. ”

“However, none of them had caught Chen Siyao’s eye. ”

“Actually, there was another important reason. It was also one of the reasons Old Master Chen had his eye on the most. That was, Chen Siyao was the only daughter of the Chen family. If she were to get married, she definitely wouldn’t be able to marry her only son. ”

“However, Song Shiyu was different. ”

“The song family’s situation was simple, and song Shiyu didn’t have any special attachment to the family. Even if Chen Siyao got married and had a child whose surname wasn’t song, Song Shiyu wouldn’t have any objections. ”

“But if it was someone else, if the child’s surname was Chen, it definitely wouldn’t work. ”

Old Master Chen couldn’t just stand by and watch the song family cut off their descendants.

A man’s life was like a spring in the grass.

Wasn’t it all for the sake of having descendants?

“Old Master Chen sighed and continued, “Did you find out which girl Shiyu has been dating frequently recently?” ”

“If he wanted song Shiyu to lower his head, he had to find the right medicine. ”

He had to find the person song Shiyu liked and make her back down.

“In fact, Old Master Chen didn’t have such a deep obsession in the beginning. He wanted Chen Siyao to be with song Shiyu, but after so many days of consideration, he decided that song Shiyu was the most suitable for Chen Siyao. ”

“After all, the person Chen Siyao liked was song Shiyu. ”

“If he tried to force Chen Siyao to be with someone she didn’t like, it would be better for Chen Siyao to be with song Shiyu. ”

“Although it might be a little difficult at first, Old Master Chen believed that once song Shiyu accepted Chen Siyao, he would treat Chen Siyao well for the rest of his life. ”

He was loyal to Chen Siyao.

Old Master Chen knew song Shiyu very well.

The Butler shook his head. “Not yet.”

“With that, the butler continued, “Third Master Song’s schedule is very clear. Let alone having frequent contact with girls, he doesn’t even have a single girl he talks to.” ”

“Hearing this, Old Master Chen frowned slightly. ”

There was such a thing?

“But if song Shiyu didn’t have a girl he liked, why did he reject Chen Siyao? ”

“Are you sure?”Old Master Chen turned to look at the housekeeper in disbelief.

“”Absolutely!”The housekeeper said, “I’ve looked into it for a long time. Third Master song really doesn’t have any special girls by his side.” ”

Song Shiyu wasn’t the type of Playboy to indulge in debauchery.

“Old Master Chen’s brows furrowed deeply. He continued, “Since he doesn’t have anyone he likes, why did he reject Yaoyao?” ”

The housekeeper shook his head. “I’m not too sure about that either.”

He had only investigated song Shiyu’s personal circumstances and didn’t know the reason why song Shiyu rejected Chen Siyao.

Old Master Chen sighed.

“The housekeeper continued to comfort him. “Old Master, don’t worry too much. Perhaps eldest miss will find a better and more outstanding son-in-law in the future.”. ”

Old Master Chen shook his head. “No one will be more outstanding than Shiyu.”

No one would be more suitable for Chen Siyao than song Shiyu.

“”How about this?”Old Master Chen Thought for a moment and then said, “Follow me to Bai Jiayu’s place.” ”

“Are you going to look for Mr. Bai?”The Butler asked.

Old Master Chen nodded.

“”Then please wait for a moment. I will arrange for the driver,”the Butler said. ” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Okay.”Old Master Chen nodded.

“Soon, the driver was arranged. ”

“Twenty minutes later, the car stopped at Bai Jiayu’s residence. ”

The Butler pushed Old Master Chen out of the car.

“When he heard that Old Master Chen was coming, Bai Jiayu scratched his head. ”

“Why can’t this old master Chen Understand?”

“The assistant stood beside Bai Jiayu and continued, “Are you going to meet him or not?” ”

“”No,”Bai Jiayu continued, “Just say that I’m not at home due to something.” ”

“Naturally, he could not meet Old Master Chen at a time like this. ”

“For a person like Old Master Chen, it was fine if he was ignored, but once he was ignored, he would become more and more enthusiastic. ”

The assistant nodded. “Okay.”

“At that moment, Bai Jiayu seemed to have thought of something. “Wait a moment.” ”

“Do you have any other instructions?”The assistant asked.

“Bai Jiayu continued, “Don’t say that I’m not at home. Just say that I don’t have time to see him right now.” ”

He had to let Old Master Chen know his current attitude.

The assistant nodded.

“”Also, I have something to tell him,”Bai Jiayu continued. ”

“Go ahead.”The assistant said.

Bai Jiayu lowered his head and whispered a few words in the assistant’s ear.
