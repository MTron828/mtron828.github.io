“Chapter 1631: 344: the aircraft carrier lifts off, blood boiling! 5”

Translator: 549690339

“[ F * ck! This YC can’t really have run away, right? ] ”

“[ I don’t think so. After all, this matter is no longer solely YC’s business! If she runs away, the international department will not let her off either. ] ”

“[ when a dog is anxious, it jumps over the wall. When a rabbit is anxious, It Bites! If YC has run out of tricks, won’t she run? If she doesn’t run and stays here, will she be ridiculed? ] ”

“Professor Cara looked at the time while watching the live broadcast. He then whispered to professor William beside him, “Go and call that Chinese man over.” ”

William nodded. “Yes.”

“A moment later, professor Cara walked over with Tang Xue. “Professor Cara, this is Miss Tang, who has been working for us all this while.” ”

“”Hello, Professor Cara.”Tang Xue walked in front of Professor Cara and bowed. ”

Dr. Cara looked up. “Where’s Miss Ye?”

“Tang Xue lowered her voice. “I haven’t seen her since this morning. If I’m not wrong, she must have run away.” ”

Run Away?

Dr. Cara frowned. He had seen the comments on the live broadcast that ye Zao had run away. He had thought it was nonsense. He had thought that ye Zao was not the kind of person who would run away at the last minute. He had not expected ye Zao to really run away!

He did not expect that ye Zao was such a person.

“However, it was normal when he thought about it. ”

This bet was betting on the future of the entire Chinese scientific research community.

“After today, the Chinese scientific research community would be in darkness, and Ye Zao would also become the sinner of the entire China. ”

It was understandable that she would be afraid.

“”Since YC has already run away, there is no need to hold the Ascension ceremony today.”Dr. Cara held the microphone and turned to look at the man sitting in the first seat. “Mr. Cen Wu Ye, what do you think?” ”

Dr. Cara did not deliberately lower his voice. His voice traveled through the microphone and reached the ears of everyone present.

The live broadcast was also very exciting.

“Cen Shaoqing sat there with no expression on his face. He held the Buddha beads in his hands. “Dr. Cara, who told you that Dr. YC has run away? There are still 18 minutes before the launch ceremony. What’s The Hurry?” ”

“”Miss Tang, tell him whether or not Dr. YC ran away.”Dr. Cara then looked at Cen Shaoqing. “Miss Tang is Chinese. She Won’t speak for US Chinese.” ”

Tang Xue was still Chinese.

“However, William had promised her that after the launch ceremony, he would help her change her nationality and settle down in C country. She would officially become the representative of Cen’s base in China! ”

“At that time, she would be a citizen of country C, and she would no longer have to look at anyone’s expression. ” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Therefore, Tang Xue did not have to be afraid of anyone at this time. ”

“”Fifth master, I know that you and Dr. YC are boyfriend and girlfriend. You Don’t believe that Dr. YC would betray you, but that’s the truth!”Tang Xue continued, “The so-called aircraft carrier is just an empty shell. It can’t fly at all. You Don’t have to waste everyone’s time. Just declare it a failure.” ”

Cen Shaoqing narrowed his eyes.

He suddenly thought of Old Master Tang.

Old Master Tang was a truly talented person. He didn’t expect to have such a descendant.

“Dr. Cara chased after him step by step, “CEN fifth master, do you still think that Dr. YC didn’t run away? Everyone’s time is precious. I advise you to sign the document as soon as possible so that you don’t embarrass yourself. You have to know that you are facing the people of the World Now!” ”

“”It’s not certain who will embarrass themselves.”Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddha beads and said slowly, “Dr. Cara, please remember what you said now. Don’t go back on your words later.” ”

“Dr. Cara narrowed his eyes. At this time, Cen Shaoqing was still being stubborn. ”

No wonder China’s technology was so backward.

“Dr. Cara smiled. “Okay, then I’ll wait for another 18 minutes. I’ll Make You Chinese admit defeat!” ”

Some of the audience could not sit still anymore. They wanted to come up to the stage and give professor Cara a beating.

“However, it was not entirely professor Cara’s fault. ”

“If ye Zao had not humiliated himself, professor Cara would not have been able to find an excuse to humiliate them even if he wanted to. ”

But now...

Ye Zao had come up to them to be humiliated.

[ it’s so embarrassing! I Can’t watch anymore! ]

“You should have shot that YC! She ran away and left a group of people to clean up her mess!”

“I’m so angry!”

Time passed quickly.

10:17.

Ye Zao was still nowhere to be seen.

“Kara turned to CEN Shaoqing and said, “CEN fifth master, it’s time. Do you have anything else to say?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing looked up slightly and was about to say something when a voice suddenly appeared in the air, “There are still 30 seconds left before the launch ceremony. Dr. Kara, why are you so aggressive? I’m here, aren’t I?” ”
