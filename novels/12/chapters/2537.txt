Great-aunt always called Lin Qingxuan by her first name.

“It was fine to call her by her first name, but she had to add the word ‘Little’in front of it. ”

“It was always like this. A child who was not even eight years old would chase after Lin Qingxuan, who was almost 50 years old, and call her ‘Little Qingxuan’ ”

“Most importantly, this great-aunt especially liked to put on airs as an elder. ”

Lin Qingxuan could not get angry yet.

“Zhao pingting asked, “Does your father have to call her aunt?” ”

“Yes.”An Lizi nodded. “There’s nothing we can do about it. It’s her fault for being so Junior!”

“Zhao pingting smiled and said, “Then whoever marries this great-aunt of yours in the future will have a very high seniority!” ”

An Lizi nodded. “Exactly. I don’t know who will be so lucky in the future!”

...

On the other side.

At the hospital.

“Vivian was sitting on the hospital bed, staring blankly ahead. ”

“A nurse came in with lunch. “Vivian, it’s time to eat.” ”

Vivian shook her head. “I can’t eat.”

“The nurse smiled and said, “Did you order takeout again?” ”

“Ever since she received ye Zao’s approval, Vivian had hardly eaten anything from the hospital during this period of time. She had been eating takeout all the time. ”

“No.”Vivi shook her head.

“The nurse was in disbelief. She smiled and said, “Then the sun has risen from the west.” ”

“Where’s sister Ye?”Vivi continued to ask.

“The nurse said, “Miss Ye had something on today and didn’t come to the hospital.” ”

“Vivi nodded and continued, “I didn’t know why Miss ye allowed me to eat spicy hot soup and other unhealthy foods. Now I finally know.” ”

“The nurse noticed that something was wrong with Vivian’s expression and asked, “Vivian, are you okay?” ”

“A few days ago, Vivian was very optimistic and cheerful. ”

Why was she so depressed today?

“”I’m fine.”Vivian shook her head and asked, “Do you know why Miss Ye suddenly allowed me to eat spicy hotpot?”? ”

“The nurse smiled and said, “Of course, it’s because your illness has nothing to do with eating spicy hotpot.” ”

“Since it had nothing to do with eating spicy hotpot, why couldn’t she eat it. ”

“”Maybe,”Vivi said with a smile ”

She used to think so too. It was not until now that Vivi knew that ye Zao had let her eat spicy hotpot because he did not want her to have any regrets in her life.

“After all, she was a person who was about to die. ”

Ye Zao wanted her to be happy in the rest of her life.

Vivi knew that ye Zao was doing this for her own good.

“However, Vivi was still a little sad. ”

Because ye Zao had let her see the beauty of life again.

“If ye Zao had not given her hope in the beginning, she would not be in so much pain. ”

“Seeing that Vivi’s expression was getting more and more lonely, the nurse asked, “Vivi, what’s wrong? is your family here again?” ”

“No.”Vivi shook her head.

“Did you encounter something unhappy?”The nurse asked.

“Not really.”Vivi still shook her head.

“The nurse sat down and patted Vivi’s shoulder. She smiled and comforted her, “Vivi, don’t worry. Your illness will be cured soon. When Miss Ye comes back, I’ll arrange an operation for you.” ”

“Okay.”

“The nurse looked at Vivi and added, “If you encounter anything unhappy, you can tell me.” ”

“”I’m really fine,”Vivi said. ”

“The nurse gave a few more instructions and left. After all, she still had other patients. ”

“Not long after the nurse left, Dr. Wang came. ”

He took the stethoscope and examined Vivi.

“”Doctor Wang, am I going to die soon?”Vivi asked. ”

“Doctor Wang did not know how to answer Vivi. She was only a teenager, but if he did not tell Vivi anything, it would be too unfair for Vivi. ”

“After all, she would have to face reality sooner or later. ”

“”Your situation is not optimistic, maybe...”doctor Wang did not say a word and continued, “But don’t worry, I am already looking for a treatment plan. I will definitely make you recover.” ”

“After he finished speaking, doctor Wang continued, “I’ve looked at Miss Ye’s plan. She’s going to arrange an operation for you the day after tomorrow. If you don’t want to die on the operating table, remember to reject this operation.” ”

“Will you die on the operating table?”Vivi asked.

“Yes.”Doctor Wang nodded.

“Vivi nodded. “Okay, I understand.” ”

“After saying that, VIVI continued, “If you don’t operate and you don’t find the treatment plan, how much time do I have?” ”

“When she said that, there was no longer any expression on Vivi’s face. ” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Doctor Wang was hesitating whether he should tell Vivi the truth.
