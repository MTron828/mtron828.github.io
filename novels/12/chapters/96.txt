Chapter 97: 075: Heal and save, Brother and sister meeting 4

Otherwise, the Yang family would not have to face a situation where the tree fell and the monkeys scattered as soon as something happened to old master Yang.

Old Master Yang glanced at him indifferently. “You want to eat your father to death with this kind of nonexistent medicine?”

The medicine that Mu Yourong brought over had no other labels other than a box.

“Miss, Miss Keke Mu said that she is the descendant of Divine Doctor Hua Tuo...”

Old Master Yang angrily rebuked, “Do you believe me when I say that I am the Jade Emperor? A person in his forties doesn’t have the slightest bit of brain!”

Yang Danian would believe whatever others said. If it was not for the fact that Yang Danian looked very similar to him when he was young, old master Yang would have suspected that this son of his was his own!

This was because other than the fact that the two of them looked similar, they didn’t look like each other in any other way.

Yang Danian was scolded until he was drenched in cold sweat. He could only watch helplessly as Sun Fulian threw the medicine away.

At this moment, Old Master Yang suddenly turned his head. “Fulian, don’t throw it away yet.”

After all, it was someone else’s item, so it wouldn’t be good to throw it away.

If Mu Yourong came back and asked for it from him, what could he return with?

When the time came, there would definitely be some wrangling.

Sun Fulian nodded.

Seeing this, Yang Danian heaved a sigh of relief. was the old master willing to take the medicine given by Mu Yourong?

Just as Yang Danian thought that the old master was willing to believe mu yourong, the old master added, “Keep it well, just in case that Miss Mu comes back to take it again.”

Yang Danian really wanted to say a few words for Mu Yourong, but he did not have the courage.

Soon, the next day arrived.

The Yang family’s car was waiting outside the hotel on time.

Ye Zao put on his coat. “Sister Shasha, why don’t You Come with me? It’s fine for you to stay in the hotel alone anyway.”

Lin Shasha said, “Zao, you’re going to treat patients and save people. I don’t know anything. Will I cause trouble for You?”

Ye Zao smiled and said, “How can that be? I don’t know anyone there. Sister Shasha, if you’re there, you can just give me some courage.”

Lin Shasha thought about it and agreed. Ye Zao was just a little girl. What if he was bullied?

Two people were better than one person.

“Okay,”Lin Shasha jumped down from the bed, “Zao, I’ll go with you.”

Lin Shasha jumped up from the bed, quickly put on her down jacket, and went downstairs with ye Zao.

As soon as they walked out of the first floor of the hotel, a young man in a suit immediately came over, “May I ask if you are Little Miracle Doctor Ye?”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “I am.”

The young man made a “Please”gesture. “Miracle doctor, this way please.”

Ye Zhuo held Lin Sha’s hand and stepped forward.

This was a very luxurious car.

The little golden figure on the front of the car was particularly eye-catching in the snow.

F * CK, F * ck!

A Rolls-royce!

Lin Sha swallowed her saliva.

There were too many rich people in the capital!

They arrived at the splendid manor.

Lin Sha was immediately stunned.

She had only read about manors and castles in novels.

She did not expect to sit in a rolls-royce and arrive at the legendary manor today..

If this were to be spread out, no one would believe it.

Lin Sha nervously looked around. She did not dare to look around for fear of embarrassing ye Zao.

Soon, they reached the inside of the manor.

Grandfather Yang was waiting for ye Zao in the living room.

Hearing the sound of a car outside, he stood up immediately. “Fu Nian, let’s go pick up the young godly doctor.”

Sun Fu Nian quickly followed grandfather Yang.

When he came to the door, he saw that it was indeed ye Zao.

“Young Godly doctor, Miss Lin, please come in.”

Old Master Yang quickly welcomed the two of them in.

Perhaps it was because he knew that his illness had a hope of being cured, compared to yesterday, Old Master Yang was much more energetic.

He ordered the servants to bring food and then ordered the servants to pour tea.

Sun Fulian asked the servants to bring a wooden box. “Little Miracle Doctor, this is the acupuncture tool that you asked me to prepare yesterday. Take a look and see if this will work.”

Ye Zhuo put down the cup in his hand and opened the wooden box to take a look. “The tools are very complete. This will do.”

“Dad, is this the Divine Doctor That You Said Can Cure You?”At this moment, Yang Danian’s voice sounded in the air.

Yang Danian had originally thought that his father had really found a divine doctor.

He had not expected that this divine doctor was just a child in his teens..

What sort of nonsense was this?

What medical skills could a child have?

Mu Yourong was at least the descendant of the Divine Doctor Hua Tuo?

This child was it? DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

This father of his was truly getting more and more muddle-headed as he got older!

Putting aside the fact that a real divine doctor did not believe, believing in a child.
