“Ye Zao glanced at her, “It seems like you haven’t seen the situation clearly. It’s understandable that you want to become a person above others. After all, people go higher and water flows lower. But your green tea method is really disgusting! Lizi has a friend like you. It’s simply an insult to her!” ”

“Zhang Qingqing was also a human. She also had her pride, but now, ye Zao was actually rubbing her pride on the floor! ”

“In Ye Zao’s heart, what exactly was she? ”

“She was ye Zao’s future sister-in-law, the future young mistress of the Lin Family! ”

“Zhang Qingqing was currently unable to vent her anger. Before she married into the Lin family, she could not offend anyone in the Lin family.., “I’ve said it before. You Can Insult Me, but please don’t insult my child! He’s the Lin family’s flesh and blood. I can swear on my dignity! Please believe me!” ”

“Dignity?”Ye Zao chuckled. “Do you have such a Thing?”

“As long as Zhang Qingqing had even the slightest bit of dignity, she wouldn’t do such a thing! ”

Zhang Qingqing was so angry that she was trembling.

“She kept retreating, but ye Zao kept pushing his luck. ”

This was too much! This was too much!

“Looking at Ye Zao’s back, Zhang Qingqing’s eyes seemed to be filled with poison. She wanted nothing more than to curse ye Zao to death. ” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

It would be best if a large truck could rush over from the road and kill ye Zao without leaving a complete corpse!

“Unfortunately, she was not a prophet. She could not let the large truck kill ye Zao! ”

“As Ye Zao walked, he sent a message. ”

[ help me check on someone. ]

“The other side immediately replied, [ okay boss! Send it over! ] ”

Ye Zao sent Zhang Qingqing’s name over.

“When the other side received the message, they opened the sky eye system and searched for this name. They actually found that there were more than two million people with the same name in China. ”

“[ boss, is it that Zhang Qingqing? ] ”

Ye Zhuo opened the database and sent Zhang Qingqing’s background information.

“”This Zhang Qingqing, I need her life situation and emotional experience in the past year!” ”

“No problem.”

“Er Mao sat in front of the computer and searched all of Zhang Qingqing’s information. He frowned slightly and said, “Strange, why would boss look up such an ordinary person?” ”

“Logically speaking, the people around the big boss should be the big boss. ”

But this Zhang Qingqing was really too ordinary. She was so ordinary that she could not be found even if she fell into the crowd.

Er Mao hummed a little tune as he looked up Zhang Qingqing’s information.

“Ye Zhuo did not go home. Instead, he came to the base. ”

“At present, the aircraft carrier project was already at the most crucial step. They needed ye Zhuo to keep an eye on it at all times. ”

“After all, they didn’t have much experience before! ”

“As soon as ye Zao arrived at the base, Cen Hai came up to him. “Miss Ye!” ”

“What’s Wrong?”Ye Zao raised his eyes slightly.

“Cen Hai continued, “There’s a problem on the flight deck. I was just about to call you!” ”

Ye Zao frowned slightly. “Let’s go and take a look.”

“Okay.”Cen Hai followed ye Zao’s footsteps.

“The two of them arrived at the construction cabin. Old Zhang, who was in charge of the flight deck, saw ye Zao walking over as if he had seen his savior. “Miss Ye!” ”

“Ye Zao nodded. “Worker Zhang, which side is the problem?” ”

“Worker Zhang immediately took out the blueprints and continued, “Miss Ye, look. It’s the problem here. If we turn on the defense system, the flight system here won’t be able to function properly!” ”

“Ye Zhuo looked at the blueprint and said, “This isn’t a problem with the deck, it’s a problem with the defense system. Cen Hai, go and find Cen Jiang.” ”

“Cen Hai nodded. “Alright, I’ll go right away!” ”

Ye Zhuo walked towards the defense cabin.

“Zhang Gong continued, “Miss Ye, can we continue the construction of the deck?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“”Sure.”Zhang Gong smiled and said, “I’m relieved to hear that from you, Miss Ye!” ”

“Zhang Gong had participated in many scientific research projects in the past, but this was his first time on an aircraft carrier. Therefore, he did not dare to make any rash decisions when he encountered problems. ”

“After all, these processes were all linked together. As long as a problem occurred in one segment, it would cause problems in all subsequent segments! ”

“Most importantly, Ye Zhuo had also signed a gambling agreement with several other countries. ”

The agreed two-year period could not be delayed because of him.

“Once the construction period was delayed, the consequences would be unimaginable! ”

Ye Zhuo came to the defense cabin.

“Not long after, Cen Hai brought Cen Jiang over. ”

“”Miss Ye, you were looking for me!”Cen Jiang said respectfully. ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Who is responsible for the quality inspection of the defense module recently?”

“Cen Jiang said, “It’s Yu Gong.” ”
