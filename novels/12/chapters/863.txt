Translator: 549690339

“Chang Yu shook his head. “Of course, your brother Chang Yu is the best. Of course, the best is still teacher Wei!” ”

Wei Xingzhi was experienced.

“There were eight fish in total, and seven of them were caught by Wei Xingzhi. ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Then we’ll eat braised fish today, fish with bean petals tomorrow, boiled fish the day after tomorrow, and fish with pickled cabbage the day after tomorrow.” ”

“Yin Wei turned to look at Ye Zao. “Ye, you know how to do all these?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Boasting.”

“Chang Yu didn’t have any objection to ye Zao at this time. He also joked, “It’s definitely boasting!” ”

Ye Zao turned to look at the two of them. “Do you know what my friends call me?”

“I don’t know.”Yin Wei and Chang Yu shook their heads.

“Ye Zhuo said with a serious expression, “Everyone calls me God Ye. I’m already a god. How can I not be powerful?” ”

“Hahaha!”Yin Wei laughed out loud.

“Chang Yu said, “God ye is nothing. My friends call me the most powerful in the world!” ”

Ye Zhuo supported himself on the boat with a smile on his face.

“Very soon, the boat stopped at the side. ”

The four of them carried the fish and the lotus leaves they had picked back to the small courtyard.

The tractor was still parked in the courtyard.

“Wei xingzhi said, “Yezi, why don’t you send this tractor back to Uncle First?” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded. “I’ll go right away.”

“Ye Zhuo sent the lotus flowers into the house and turned to look at Wei Xingzhi. “Teacher Wei, why don’t you bring two fish to thank uncle?” ”

“”It’s my pleasure.”Wei Xingzhi nodded. “Uncle is so enthusiastic. You should bring two fish over. Yezi, you’re the most thoughtful one!” ”

Ye Zhuo took a bag and put the fish in it. He hung it on the tractor and drove it to master’s place.

Yin Wei looked at ye Zhuo’s back and sighed. “Yezi is really amazing! I admire her so much!”

“Before this, Yin Wei had never seen a girl like Ye Zhuo. ”

She was very confident.

She was very beautiful.

“More importantly, she was not arrogant at all. ”

She did not think that she would be complacent about everything.

“From the beginning to the end, she was unperturbed. ”

She did not look like a teenage girl at all.

Yin Wei was not the only one who was surprised.

“There were also the other two members of the Red Team, Wei Xingzhi and Chang Yu. ”

These two people thought that ye Zhuo was just an internet celebrity who came in through the back door.

They did not expect that this person had strength and looks!

He was simply omnipotent.

“It was easy to imagine that after this episode’s broadcast, Ye Zhuo would definitely become famous overnight. ”

“On this side, Ye Zhuo drove the tractor into the uncle’s courtyard. ”

The uncle and the aunt were preparing dinner in the house.

“When they heard the sound, the two of them walked out of the house. ”

“”Uncle, aunt,”ye Zhuo called out politely. ”

“The uncle smiled and said, “Young Lady, is my tractor running okay?” ”

“”It’s very good!”Ye Zhuo took the two fish out of the car. “Uncle, thank you for lending me the tractor. This is a gift from our program team. Please accept it.” ”

“The uncle refused, “Didn’t I just borrow a tractor? You Don’t have to be so polite!” ”

“The aunt also said, “Take the fish back and eat it yourself! I see that there are quite a few people here. If the food is not enough, you can come to our vegetable garden to pick it!” ”

The people in the mountains were especially enthusiastic.

“Ye Zhuo stuffed the fish into the aunt’s hands, “Uncle, aunt, we just fished this fish in the fish pond. We can not afford to finish it even if we fished a lot of it. You guys can be your subordinates. If you don’t accept it, I will be too embarrassed to come and borrow a tractor next time.” ”

“After saying this, the aunt was finally willing to accept it. She held ye Zhuo’s hand and said, “Young lady, if you want to borrow a tractor, you can come and borrow it at any time. Don’t stand on ceremony with us.” ”

“”Okay, thank you.”Ye Zao bowed slightly. ”

“After returning the tractor, Ye Zao walked back. When he passed by the program team’s vegetable garden, he picked some vegetables and garlic and went back. ”

“After he went back, ye Zao went to the kitchen and started cooking. ”

“Yin Wei walked in from outside. “Yezi, let me help you.” ”

“Ye Zao did not stand on ceremony. He smiled and said, “Then help me wash the vegetables in the basket.” ”

“”Okay.”Yin Wei picked up the basket and continued, “Do you want to wash all of these?” ”

“”Yes, wash them all.”Ye Zao nodded slightly. ”

“Yin Wei was not the kind of rich young lady who would not touch the sun. Although she did not know how to cook, there was no problem in washing the vegetables. ”

The vegetables were washed very quickly.

Ye Zao began to cut the vegetables.

Yin Wei started a fire under the stove. She originally thought that ye Zao only knew how to cook.

She didn’t expect that this person was even more professional than a chef.

“An ordinary white radish, in her hands, turned into an exquisite hibiscus flower in less than three minutes. ”

“Ye Zao put the carved carrots into the plate to make decorations, and then began to kill the fish, sliced fish. ”

“The whole movement was smooth and smooth, without even a frown. ”

“Seeing this, Yin Wei couldn’t bear to blink her eyes. ”

Amazing!

Ye Zao was simply too amazing.

“Not long after, the small courtyard was filled with a seductive fragrance. ”

“At this moment, team blue had finally brought back all the watermelons. ”

Lu Qi slumped on the ground without any form of image. “I’m so tired.”

Wang Xuancheng sniffed. “It smells so good! I didn’t expect the sunken fish to be so good at cooking!”

Who else but song Chenyu could cook such a delicious meal?

“Lu Qi smiled and said, “We’re going to have a feast tonight!” ” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Wang Xuancheng rubbed his belly. “Lu Qi, are you hungry?” ”

“Lu Qi nodded. “Yes! How about you?”They had been working all afternoon. Up until now, they had eaten nothing but water. How could they not be hungry? Lu Qi even felt that she could eat three cows right now! ”

Wang Xuancheng also nodded. “I’m really looking forward to Chenyu’s dinner!”

“Song Chenyu’s dishes smelled so good, so it would definitely taste better! ”

“Thinking of this, Wang Xuancheng swallowed his throat. ”

“Lu Qi stood up from the chair and said, “Let’s go outside and take a look first! We can eat when we come back later!” ”

“Okay.”Wang Xuancheng nodded and the two of them walked outside.

Song Chenyu was indeed cooking in the kitchen.

“However, this meal was very frustrating. ”

“Although she had learned to cook, when she learned to cook, the ingredients and seasonings were prepared by the chef in advance. Even the onions, ginger, and garlic were cut by others. ”

But now...

She had to do everything herself.

She had to wash the dishes and cut the meat herself.

She even had to kill the fish herself.

“Moreover, there was no rice cooker in the mountains, so she had to use firewood to cook rice. Usually, she used the rice cooker to cook rice. Now that it was suddenly changed to firewood, she could not control the heat at all. ”

Although she had song Yiwan’s help.

“However, song Yiwan was the type of person who would get more and more busy the more she helped. ”

“In less than three minutes, song Yiwan had already broken two bowls. ”

“Song Chenyu looked at song Yiwan and tried his best to suppress the anger in his heart. He then said, “Yiwan, it’s been a tiring day. Why Don’t you go and rest for a while? I’ll take care of the kitchen.” ”

“Song Yiwan walked down the stairs. “Chenyu, thank you for your hard work.” ”

“She had already broken two bowls. If she continued to stay in the kitchen, her image would be ruined. ”

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “My biggest interest is cooking. It’s not hard to do what I like to do.” ”

“Song yiwan flattered, “Chenyu, you’re really amazing! Unlike me, I only know how to eat.” ”

“After song Yiwan left, song Chenyu continued to cook. ”

“After working for more than an hour, song Chenyu finally finished cooking a vegetable dish. ”

“At this moment, Lu Qi walked in from the kitchen and said with a smile, “Chenyu, did you cook braised fish in brown sauce? I could smell the fragrance outside the courtyard. Your cooking is simply superb!” ”

“Song Chenyu was a little embarrassed, but he had to answer, “I haven’t killed the fish yet.” ”

“Lu Qi was also a little embarrassed. He touched his nose and said, “Is there anything I can help you with?” ”
