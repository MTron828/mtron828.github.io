“Hearing this, Tang Mi’s expression changed. ”

Oh No!

How did this matter get discovered by Xiao Qing?

“Yes.”Tang mi nodded.

“Since Xiao Qing had already discovered it, then there was no need for her to hide it! ”

“You stupid girl! Who allowed you to join the aircraft carrier project team?”

Tang mi lowered her head and didn’t say anything.

“You joined the aircraft carrier project team?”Tang Shengli turned to look at Tang Mi.

Tang mi nodded.

“Really?”Tang Shengli immediately asked.

“”Yes,”Tang Mi said. ”

“Tang shengli asked again, “When did you join?” ”

“Tang mi thought for a moment and then said, “Last year.” ”

“Tang shengli laughed out loud. “You Child, why didn’t you say hello to your mother and me? ! Good, good, good! This is a good thing!” ”

Tang mi looked at Tang Shengli in surprise. She even thought that she was hallucinating.

“”Good thing? Tang Shengli, I think you’re Crazy!”Xiao Qing walked over, he pinched Tang Shengli’s ear. “That miss ye from their base just signed a betting agreement with C Nation not long ago. Have you thought about the consequences?” ”

“After saying that, Xiao Qing turned to look at Tang Mi. “Leave the aircraft carrier project team immediately!” ”

“Why?”Tang mi frowned.

“”Why? Tell me why!”Xiao Qing continued, “Are you going to watch your bright future be destroyed in your hands?” ”

“Tang mi said firmly, “I believe that Miss Ye will definitely be able to build our own aircraft carrier!” ”

“”I think you’re Crazy!”Xiao Qing continued, “I’ll give you three days to leave the aircraft carrier team immediately! Otherwise, you won’t be our daughter!” ”

“In Xiao Qing’s eyes, Tang Mi’s actions were no different from destroying her own future. ”

“Ye Zhuo had signed a bet agreement. If the aircraft carrier project failed, those who participated in the construction of the aircraft carrier would be nailed to the pillar of shame. ”

Tang Mi was Xiao Qing’s daughter. She knew Tang Mi very well. Tang Mi loved scientific research more than her own life.

“If the aircraft carrier project failed, Tang Mi would never be able to set foot in the scientific research world again. ”

“Tang mi bit her lip and continued, “Now that the matter has been settled, I Can’t quit halfway! Even if I really quit the planning team, no department would be willing to take me in!” ”

“Xiao Qing continued, “I’ll talk to Xiaoxue about this! Xiaoxue will definitely have a way! If it really doesn’t work out, I’ll go to the primary school and ask you to be her assistant! In short, you should resign immediately!” ”

“Speaking up to this point, Xiao Qing sighed and continued, “Tell Me, why can’t you learn from Xiaoxue? Look at how much Xiaoxue has.” ”

He had to admit that Tang Xue was quite amazing.

“Back then, Tang Xue only took the exam once and was accepted by the CEN base. ”

Tang Mi took the exam three times instead.

It was only until the last time that she was accepted by the CEN base.

“”Mom, don’t mind my business! “I won’t be Tang Xue’s assistant, and I Won’t resign!”Tang mi continued, “I just want to be by Miss Ye’s side! “I want to complete the aircraft carrier project with the people from Area C!” ”

Xiao Qing was so angry by Tang Mi’s words that he laughed.

Complete the aircraft carrier project?

“”Do you think building an aircraft carrier is as easy as building a plane?”Xiao Qing continued, “I’ve seen the news. Your Miss Ye, who doesn’t know the immensity of Heaven and earth, still wants to talk about building an aircraft carrier that can reach the speed of light and land on the eight planets! “You’re also a scientist. I don’t think I need to explain to you what the speed of light represents, right? “Do you think the current civilization of mankind can build an aircraft that can surpass the speed of light?” ”

There were a total of level seven civilizations in the universe.

A level one civilization could use all the resources on the planet they were on.

A level two civilization could freely control the energy output of the planet they were on.

Only a level five civilization could build an aircraft that could surpass the speed of light.

“Humanity was currently in a Level 1 civilization. They had not even reached level 2, yet they were dreaming of landing on the eight planets and flying out of the Solar System. Wasn’t this a dream? ” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

It was precisely because Tang Mi loved scientific research and her work that Xiao Qing did not want to do something that he would regret.

“”Why not? You haven’t even tried, how do you know you can’t?”Tang mi continued, “Miracles are created with your hands, not imagination!” ”

“”I think you’re Crazy!”Xiao Qing continued, “I’ll give you one last chance. Leave the aircraft carrier project team tomorrow!” ”
