“Zhou ziyue continued, “If the baby cries again next time, you can try this method.””

“”Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded and asked curiously, “Ziyue, how do you know so much?””

“Zhou ziyue, an unmarried little girl, actually knew something that even her child’s mother didn’t know. This was too rare.”

“Zhou ziyue explained, “When I was in college, I studied neonatal care, so I know a little about it.””

“”I see.”Bai Jingshu continued, “So What do you do now?””

“”I’m a kindergarten teacher,”Zhou Ziyue replied.”

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “No wonder.””

“Zhou Ziyue maintained a faint smile on her face and said, “Why don’t we add each other on wechat? If you encounter any problems in the future, you can look for me.””

“Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded and took out her phone. “I’ll scan you.”

“Zhou ziyue said, “It’s not convenient for you to carry the baby. Let me do it.””

“Okay.”Bai Jingshu pulled out her QR code.

Di —

The sound of a notification indicating that they had successfully added each other as friends rang out.

“After adding Bai Jingshu on wechat, Zhou Ziyue was surprised to discover that Bai Jingshu was a writer. “Are you a writer?””

Bai Jingshu nodded.

“This was the first time Zhou Ziyue had met a writer in real life. She smiled and said, “So writers are so beautiful. I thought writers were the kind of otaku girls who wear thick glasses.””

“Bai Jingshu said, “I was indeed short-sighted before, but I corrected it later.””

“Zhou ziyue continued, “I really like your ‘The Great Ming Dynasty’. Can you give me an autograph?””

“Sure.”Bai Jingshu nodded.

Zhou Ziyue took out her hand again. “Let’s take a photo together. This is my first time successfully chasing after a celebrity!”

“Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded.

“Zhou Ziyue took a few photos and asked, “Can I post it on wechat? Use the photo we took just now.””

“Sure.”

“After a short period of time together, Bai Jingshu realized that she and Zhou Ziyue got along quite well.”

“At the very least, Zhou Ziyue was a person who knew her limits and knew how to advance and retreat.” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“If it was anyone else, they probably wouldn’t ask for her opinion like Zhou Ziyue did.”

Zhou Ziyue edited a friend circle and posted it.

[ I didn’t expect that the author of ‘The Great Ming Dynasty’was actually my cousin and sister-in-law! I can be considered to have succeeded in chasing after celebrities! ]

“‘The Great Ming Dynasty’was a very popular novel. After it was adapted into an IP, it became even more popular in China.”

“After Zhou Ziyue posted it on her wechat moments, it immediately attracted a crowd of people to watch.”

“In less than ten minutes, the comments on her wechat moments had increased to fifty.”

“”Wow Wow Wow! I really like the author, Da Da!””

“Can you help me get an autograph book?”

“Oh my God! I didn’t expect the author of the Great Ming dynasty to be related to you!”

“I’m so envious!”

“I want to have a cousin like her too. Forget it... My Cousin doesn’t deserve her!”

“...”

“Looking at the comments of the crowd, Zhou Ziyue’s brows unconsciously curved up. This was the first time she felt the feeling of being chased by others.”

It was... not bad.

“However, Zhou Ziyue did not indulge in this feeling. She quickly put away her phone and looked at Bai Jingshu. “Jingshu, you’re really talented!””

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “I can’t say that I’m very talented. I just like history better than ordinary people.””

“Nowadays, many novels and TV series on the market were changing history.”

Bai Jingshu’s greatest success was that she was restoring history.

What she presented in front of everyone was the true Ming dynasty.

“Even if it was just a small detail, she would have to ponder over it for a long time.”

“Zhou ziyue continued, “You’re too modest.””

Bai Jingshu smiled.

...

“Before long, Zhou Ziyue looked at the time and said, “Jingshu, it’s time for me to go out with my mom and the others.””

“”Okay, you go ahead,”Bai Jingshu said.”

Zhou Ziyue turned around and left.

Ye Shu and ye Sui were already in Zhou Ziyue.

“Lin Jincheng was also there. He looked at ye Shu and said, “It’s not easy for second sister and the others to come to the capital. Bring them to have fun.””

Ye Shu nodded. “I know.”

“Ye Sui continued, “I didn’t come here often in the past, but now I Have Little Shu!””

“In the future, the capital would also become her second hometown.”

“Lin Jincheng added, “You two sisters can indeed walk around more often when you have nothing to do.””

“After saying that, Lin Jincheng looked at Ye Shu. “Where are you planning to go today?””

“Ye Shu said, “I’m going to Tonggong Alley first, then to the Great Wall.””

“Okay.”Lin Jincheng nodded.

“After saying that, ye Shu said, “Second sister, if you’re not in a hurry to go home, we can still go to Fu Hai the day after tomorrow.””

Fu Hai was one of the capital’s most unique attractions.

“However, due to the large number of visitors, in order to maintain the attraction, it was only open to the public on Wednesdays and Fridays.”

“Ye Sui smiled and said, “No rush, no rush. Xiao Shu, to tell you the truth, we are here to settle down in the capital. You and brother-in-law are both capable people. We will leave the matter of settling down and buying a house to you!””

“”Settling down in the capital?”Ye Shu said, “That is not a small matter! Have you discussed it with brother-in-law?””

“”He’s more than happy to settle down in the capital!”! “What’s there to discuss!”Ye Sui continued, “Little Shu, it’s only because of you and brother-in-law that your brother-in-law and I dare to dream of settling down! Otherwise, we’ll be cooped up in that small place, yunjing, for the rest of our lives! Ziyue, quickly come and thank your aunt!””

“Thank...”

Zhang Ziyue was about to say something when Lin Ze walked over from the side. “Don’t be in a hurry to say thank you.”

“”Ah Ze, what do you mean?”Ye Sui looked at Lin Ze.”

“Lin Ze continued, “You grew up with my mother, and you’re a few years older than her, so I respectfully address you as second aunt. “As the saying goes, people have to move on. So, I don’t want to pursue the things that happened to my mother anymore, but you can’t climb up the ladder!””

Ye Sui was stunned.

She didn’t expect Lin Ze to say such a thing so bluntly.

He really didn’t have any upbringing.

“He was just a junior, what right did he have to criticize her in front of her!”

She didn’t know how ye Shu taught him!

“But at this moment, ye Sui could only keep a straight face, she smiled and said, “Ah Ze, did you misunderstand something? Your mother and I, we are Biological Sisters! “What do you mean by growing up together? We are more than just fated to grow up together!”! “As the saying goes, blood is thicker than water. Blood-related sisters should help each other out!””

“Ye Sui paused and continued, “Actually, I was just casually mentioning the matter of settling down. If you guys are really in a difficult situation, then forget it.””

“Lin Ze wanted to say something else, but ye Shu held his wrist. “Forget it, forget it.””

“Many things had happened over the years, and Ye Shu suddenly understood that life was just a show”

“On this stage, there would be good people and bad people, and there would also be people like ye Sui.”

“”Anyway, she still has to go back.””

“Since ye Shu had spoken, Lin Ze couldn’t say anything more. He just said, “Settling down depends on the policies of the capital. It’s not like my mom can settle down just because she says so.””

“Lin Jincheng also said at this moment, “Alright, Little Shu, quickly bring second sister and Ziyue out.””

“Okay.”Ye Shu nodded. “Let’s go.”

“Ye Sui felt very uncomfortable, but he could not say anything else. He left with Ye Shu.”

Beijing was much more prosperous than Yun Jing.

The traffic was naturally very congested.

“Ye Sui sat in the back seat. “Little Shu, I saw on the television that rich people always fly helicopters when they go out! It’s so congested when they drive!””

“”SIS, that’s just what the television said,”ye Shu said. “You also have to follow many rules when you fly a helicopter. You Can’t just fly it whenever you want.””

“Ye Sui said with some dissatisfaction, “I think you just don’t want to sit for me.””

Ye Sui understood ye Shu too well.

She was timid and afraid of trouble.

“She was no longer in the Lin family, but no one would speak up for ye Shu.”

“Ye Shu said, “You can think whatever you want.””

“”Little Shu!”Hearing this, Ye Sui looked at Ye Shu in surprise. “How did you become like this now!””

The Ye Shu in the past was not like this.

“If it was in the past, Ye Shu would definitely bring her to the helicopter immediately.”

“Ye Shu looked at ye Sui. “People change. Moreover, there is a limit to how much a person can endure.””

Ye Sui was stunned.

Zhou Ziyue was also stunned because her impression of her aunt was the same as ye Sui’s.

“It seemed that ye Shu, who had become a rich lady, had really changed a lot.”

“Ye Sui quickly reacted and said with a smile, “Little Shu, what are you talking about! We Are Biological Sisters! As a sister, you have become rich. Can’t you help a sister like me?””

“Speaking of this, ye Sui paused and said, “Back then, when you were in trouble, I gave you all the money I had! If it weren’t for me, would I have the current you?””
