This was a blessing that others couldn’t even hope for.

“Mother Li smiled and said, “Not just classmates, I heard that they’re roommates too.” ”

“”Is that so?”Father Li didn’t know much about Li Yueyue’s roommates. It was said that girls avoided their fathers. Usually, it was mother Li who had more contact with Li Yueyue. ”

“Of course it’s true!”Mother Li nodded.

“Father Li suddenly remembered something and continued, “By the way, why did Shuyi come to us just now?” ”

“”I’m not sure.”Mother Li shook her head. “Who cares about her? If she comes, we will greet her with a smile. If she goes, we will greet her with a smile as long as we don’t lose our manners.” ”

“Mother Li also didn’t like Li Shuyi, her eldest niece. ”

Because Li Shuyi was too arrogant.

Although Li Shuyi was indeed capable.

“But even if she was capable, she could not be so arrogant! ”

“Ye Zhuo was much more powerful than Li Shuyi, but ye Zhuo was not arrogant at all. ”

“The pot of water did not make a sound, and half the pot of water jingled. ”

“After that.., mother Li continued, “It’s not our Yueyue’s fault for not getting along well with Shuyi. Look at her just now, she was so overbearing! It was as if she was the president of C Nation! She was simply uncultured! I wonder how second brother and second sister-in-law usually teach her! Fortunately, Miss Ye and Cen Fifth Master were unwilling to lower themselves to her level!” ”

“If it were anyone else, even if they did not know who cen fifth master and Ye Zhuo were, they would at least greet them politely. ”

“Li Shuyi, on the other hand, did not even say a word of courtesy. ”

She simply did not take their uncle and aunt seriously.

“After all, Cen Shaoqing and ye Zhuo were their guests. If Li Shuyi did not respect her guests, it meant that she did not respect them. ”

“Father Li also knew that Li Shuyi’s attitude was a little bad, but he could not do anything about it. He was only Li Shuyi’s uncle, and he could not help his brother educate his niece, “She’s still someone else’s daughter, let her go! Anyway, others are poking at second brother’s backbone, not ours.” ”

“Speaking up to this point, father li paused and continued, “The cultural education she received is also different from ours. Yueyin, don’t lower yourself to the level of a child.” ”

“Mother Li said, “I can’t be bothered with your family’s troubles.” ”

Father Li nodded carefully.

“Just then, mother Li seemed to have thought of something and continued, “I heard that your mother is coming back.” ”

“”What?”Hearing this news, Father Li was also greatly troubled. ”

The old lady of the Li family knew nothing but to torment people.

“Back then, because she opposed the marriage between Li Sanzhu and Fang Yueyin, she directly cut off the mother-child relationship with Li Sanzhu and then followed the second son of the Li family to live abroad. In the end, she even moved her household registration there, he became a new C Nation citizen. ”

“Later, an accident happened. Li Sanzhu made a windfall and started a breeding business. Only then did Old Lady Li take a good look at Li Sanzhu and Fang Yueyin. ”

“However, it had been a long time since Old Lady Li had returned to the country. ”

It had been four to five years since the last car had returned to the country.

“Thinking back to the last time Old Lady Li had returned to the country, Li Sanzhu’s scalp still felt numb. ”

“Although Old Lady Li was his biological mother, he still could not stand Old Lady Li. ”

“Fang yueyin said, “I heard from second sister-in-law that old lady seems to be returning to the country to retire.” ”

“”Retire to the country to retire?”Hearing this news, Li Sanzhu was immediately dumbfounded. ”

“When Fang Yueyin saw Li Sanzhu like this.., he smiled and said, “I’m not even dumbfounded yet, but you’re dumbfounded first! “That’s your mother. Anyway, let me put it this way. I Won’t refuse to provide for your mother in her old age. It’s our children’s duty to provide for the elderly. She’s good and I’m good, but if your mother wants to do it when the time comes, Don’t blame me for being impolite!” ”

“Fang Yueyin was not the kind of person who would be unreasonable. She was also someone else’s mother. In the future, she would also have to be someone else’s mother-in-law. Therefore, she wanted to set a good example for the children. ”

She was determined not to be a negative example for the children.

“Li Sanzhu was extremely touched by his wife’s understanding. He reached out and hugged Fang Yueyin. “Yueyin, thank you.” ”

“Old Lady Li had done many outrageous things to Fang Yueyin previously. She had thought that after Old Lady Li brought up the matter of returning to the country to retire, Fang Yueyin would definitely not agree. She had not expected Fang Yueyin to agree! ”

No wonder the ancient people said that one should marry a good wife.

“”Don’t be in a hurry to thank me. Did you hear what I Said?”Fang Yueyin looked at Li Sanzhu and continued, “The prerequisite is that your mother doesn’t do it. If she does, don’t blame me for turning hostile and refusing to acknowledge her!” ”

“Li sanzhu smiled and said, “Don’t worry about that. If she does it, I won’t be able to tolerate it, not to mention you.” ”
