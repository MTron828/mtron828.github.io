“Ye Zao slightly raised his eyes and saw a slender figure. His thin lips were tightly pursed, and his sharp and cold facial features were hidden under the crystal lights. He was different from the man in a suit and tie at the cocktail party. ”

“He was wearing a plain white long gown with intricate patterns embroidered on the cuffs. In his hands was a string of polished red Buddha beads, which made his hands look fair and slender. ”

“He looked cold and self-controlled, as if he could return with the wind at any time. ”

It was Cen Shaoqing.

“Thank you for the compliment.”Ye Zhuo picked up a piece of exquisite dessert and handed it to him. “This Baklava is not bad. Do you want to try it?”

“Cen Shaoqing reached out to take it and tasted it, but his expression did not change. ”

It was sweet and sweet.

His entire nasal cavity was filled with this sweet and greasy taste.

He did not know how she was eating so happily.

“How is the taste?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“”Yes, very good.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. ”

“Ye Zhuo continued to recommend to CEN shaoqing, “Not bad, right! And this princess cake is also very good! Do you want to try it?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing was very resistant to these sweet desserts in his heart, but his hand still took it very honestly. ”

Cen Shaoqing did not reject any of the cakes that ye Zhuo recommended.

He ate them one by one.

He did not waste any of them.

“Seeing that Cen Shaoqing also loved desserts so much, ye Zhuo felt as if he had a thousand cups of wine but few confidants. “The best dessert I’ve eaten is in Aki...” ”

“At this point, Ye Zhuo finally realized that this was no longer the world that she lived in. He immediately changed his words and said, “It’s in a very, very far place.” ”

“”Let’s try it together if we have the chance?”Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads, his expression unchanged. ”

“Ye Zao took a big bite of the mousse cake. “If we have the chance, we can try it together.”Unfortunately... ... She didn’t know if she could return to the previous world. ”

“Then it’s settled.”

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly and brought a piece of dessert for CEN Shaoqing.

Li Qiandong was dumbfounded when he saw this scene.

He raised his hand and rubbed his eyes.

“However, the scene in front of him did not change at all. The person who was eating the dessert was really Cen Shaoqing! ”

“Moreover, if he remembered correctly, Cen Shaoqing was not only a vegetarian, but he also did not like to eat sweet things. ”

“Li Qiandong had known cen Shaoqing for so long, but Cen Shaoqing had not even eaten a birthday cake! ”

But today!

CEN Shaoqing was actually eating dessert.

Could it be that he had met a fake CEN Shaoqing in the past?

Mu Yourong also saw this scene.

She was so upset that she furrowed her brows.

What right did ye Zhuo have?

What right did he have to be so close to Fifth Master Cen?

The person standing next to fifth master Cen should be her!

“”Big Brother Li, Sister Ye Zhuo seems to be very familiar with fifth master?”Mu Yourong, who was at the side, spoke as if it was unintentional. ”

“Afraid that Mu Yourong would misunderstand, Li Qiandong hurriedly explained, “Yourong, don’t misunderstand. I asked fifth brother before, he doesn’t have any romantic feelings towards the Great God! They are just very ordinary friends.” ”

No romantic feelings?

“Mu Yourong narrowed her eyes, and a faint light appeared in the depths of her eyes. ”

Why would Li Qiandong explain this to her all of a sudden?

Could it be... that fifth master Cen had already fallen in love with her?

“Fifth Master Cen was afraid that she would misunderstand, so he had Li Qiandong explain it to her. ”

“After all, Li Qiandong and fifth master cen were the best of brothers. There were no secrets between him and Fifth Master Cen. ”

So!

Fifth Master Cen had definitely fallen in love with her.

“It seemed that everything was developing according to her guess. At the family identification banquet that night, fifth master Cen had already noticed her. ”

“Otherwise, why would Li Qiandong explain all this to her for no reason? ”

“If fifth master Cen did not care about her at all, why would Li Qiandong bother? ”

It made sense when she thought about it!

How could a lowly person like ye Zhuo catch the eyes of Fifth Master Cen?

“The reason why Fifth Master Cen had gone to speak to ye Zhuo was probably to attract her attention. After all, Ye Zhuo had once occupied the magpie’s nest and replaced her position! ”

“With this thought in mind, Mu Yourong felt that the grievances she had suffered before were nothing. ”

“After all, fifth master Cen loved her. ” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Once she married Fifth Master Cen, in the entire Hua Nation, who would dare to look down on her? ”

“Mu Yourong smiled slightly and said deliberately, “I was just asking out of curiosity. However, I think that fifth master and sister Ye Zhuo are quite compatible.” ”

She had said this on purpose.

She had to let Cen Shaoqing know through Li Qiandong that she was different from other coquettish bitches.

Only by doing the opposite could cen Shaoqing be unable to extricate himself from her!

“Li Qiandong said, “Although they look quite compatible, I feel that the Almighty and fifth brother are somewhat unsuitable to be together. The Almighty is so powerful, and fifth brother is also so powerful. Fifth Brother is more suitable for a little bird-doting girl like you.” ”
