Cen Yuyan was right.

“No matter what, she was Cen Shaoqing’s sister. As long as Cen Yuyan made a move personally, ye Zao would have to post a clarification on Weibo. ”

“Once ye Zao posted a clarification on Weibo, this matter would not affect her at all. She could even gain a wave of popularity because of this matter. ”

It was really a blessing in disguise.

Song Chenyu turned around and walked towards the ward.

Cen Yuyan came to Ye Zao’s residence.

The person who opened the door was ye Zao.

“Fourth sister.”

Cen Yuyan looked into the house. “Is Shaoqing not here?”

“”He’s sleeping upstairs,”ye Zao replied. ”

Cen Shaoqing had been catching a plane for the whole day and was currently sleeping upstairs.

Cen Yuyan had a rough idea and followed ye Zao into the house.

This was a two-story house.

It was located in the center of the city.

The transportation was convenient and there were scenic spots nearby.

“In addition, the East continent’s climate was good and it was close to the sea. It was very suitable for retirement, so ye Zao bought this house when he participated in the first episode of the program. ”

“When he reached the house, a robot brought him tea. ”

“Cen Yuyan looked at Ye Zao and said earnestly, “Zao Zao, Ah, I know that you’re a reasonable and good girl. I came here this time because I have something to tell you.” ”

Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Go ahead.”

“Cen Yuyan looked at Ye Zao, “I saw Chenyu apologizing to you on Weibo, but in the end, this matter was not Chenyu’s fault. She was also one of the victims. “I hope that you can delete that Weibo Post and post a new one to clarify that this matter has nothing to do with her.” ”

“”If it’s not song Chenyu’s fault, then fourth sister, whose fault do you think it is?”Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly. ”

“Cen Yuyan’s expression turned cold, “Do you really want me to say such harsh words? “Ye Zao, on account that you’re Shaoqing’s girlfriend, I won’t argue with you about Chenyu apologizing. However, you must immediately post an apology to Chenyu on Weibo! Otherwise, this matter won’t end!” ”

“Cen Yuyan’s last sentence was loud and clear. It was as if if ye Zhuo did not apologize and post a clarification on Weibo, she would teach ye Zhuo a lesson. ”

“Without even thinking, it was obvious that ye Zhuo must be very flustered right now. ”

“She was the Cen family’s fourth miss, Cen Shaoqing’s biological sister. ”

Making her angry was making Cen Shaoqing angry!

“Most importantly, Cen Shaoqing had always respected her as his sister. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen had forced ye Zhuo into Cen Shaoqing’s hands. Cen Shaoqing did not like ye Zhuo at all, so he must have been tired of ye Zhuo long ago. ”

It was just that he had never found an opportunity to get rid of Ye Zhuo.

“Taking advantage of this opportunity, CEN Shaoqing could just get rid of Ye Zhuo. ”

“Actually, Ye Zhuo also knew his own situation. ”

Wasn’t she just relying on Old Lady Cen’s blurred vision to like her?

If Old Lady Cen wasn’t there...

What would ye Zao Be?

Ye Zao couldn’t even compare to song Chenyu’s little finger.

But this was the east continent.

“Old Lady Cen was thousands of miles away in the capital, and right now, there was no one to support ye Zao! ”

Would Ye Zao Dare to challenge her?

In less than three seconds...

Ye Zao would apologize to her.

“Cen Yuyan curled her lips slightly and continued, “If you don’t know how to do it, send me the password for Your Weibo account. I’ll get someone to do it.” ”

“Ye Zao looked at Cen Yuyan like this, his eyes sparkling, “I can understand if you want to be a dog for Song Chenyu. After all, everyone is blind at times, but is it really good for your brain to be like this? After all, you’re Cen Shaoqing’s fourth sister. Can’t you give Cen Shaoqing some face?” ”

Lick a dog?

Blind?

And she even said that she had embarrassed Cen Shaoqing?

“Cen Yuyan thought that she was hearing things. She originally thought that ye Zao would lower himself and apologize to her, but she did not expect that ye Zao would actually dare to say such words to her. ”

This was really heaven-defying!

Did Ye Zao really think that Cen Shaoqing loved her?

Cen Shaoqing was merely putting on an act for her to see.

Cen Yuyan had never been scolded like this by someone pointing at her nose. She was so angry that her entire body was trembling. She pointed at ye Zao and could not say a word for a long time.

“Ye Zao’s tone was shallow as he continued, “On account of Cen Shaoqing, I don’t want to argue with you about today’s matter. You can leave.” ”

Don’t want to argue with her?

Cen Yuyan was about to faint from ye Zao’s anger.

Just who didn’t want to argue with whom?

Ye Zao really treated her as a human!

How disgusting!

“Cen Yuyan’s expression instantly changed, “Ye Zhuo! I’m Shaoqing’s fourth sister! Don’t think that just because my grandmother likes you, you can be arrogant! Let me tell you! As long as I don’t approve of you, you can never marry into our Cen family!” ”

“Is that so?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly.

“At this moment, soft footsteps sounded from upstairs. ”

Cen Yuyan turned around to look.

She saw a slender figure slowly walking down the stairs with a string of Buddhist beads in his hand.

Cen Yuyan’s eyes lit up when she saw who it was. “Shaoqing! You’re finally down!”

Cen Shaoqing looked at Cen Yuyan with a layer of frost in his eyes. “Repeat what you said just now.”

What was Cen Shaoqing doing here?

“Of course, he was here to support her and vent her anger. ”

“She was Cen Shaoqing’s fourth sister, but ye Zhuo was so arrogant. ”

“Cen Shaoqing did not like ye Zao to begin with. This time, Ye Zao had hit the gun’s muzzle. ”

“Moreover, Cen Shaoqing was the most protective. ”

“Although Cen Shaoqing was a Buddhist, if anyone crossed his bottom line, it would be over. ”

Who was Cen Shaoqing’s bottom line?

“Of course, it was her fourth sister! ”

“Cen Yuyan became more and more proud and began to complain, “Shaoqing, you also know that Chenyu is my best friend. She is an extremely kind-hearted girl, but is kindness enough for ye Zhuo to bully her as he pleases? “Chenyu was also a victim of that incident, but ye Zhuo actually made Chenyu, the victim, apologize to her! “I asked her to delete her Weibo to clarify that this incident had nothing to do with Chenyu, but she actually scolded me! She called me blind and called me a dog-eater!” ”
