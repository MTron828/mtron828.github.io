8 minutes.

“Not only did she solve all the problems, she even wrote a script! ”

Just how strong is she?

“Even the best hackers can’t compare to her, right? ”

“This time, not only Li Hua and Liu Qiang were stunned, even the entire program department raised their heads to look at Ye Zhuo. ”

Their eyes were filled with shock!

No one had expected that the boss’relatives would be so shameless!

“Most importantly, they were beautiful. ”

“Liu Qiang nodded. “O-okay, I got it.” ”

“Whether it was Li Hua or Liu Qiang, the two of them no longer dared to look down on ye Zhuo. ”

“Ye Zhuo turned to look at the secretary. “Sister Wu, let’s go up.” ”

The secretary nodded and followed ye Zhuo’s footsteps.

After the two of them left.

The entire program department was Abuzz with discussion.

“D * MN! I didn’t expect Miss Ye to be so amazing!”

“”It’s fine if she’s amazing, but she’s so beautiful! If this were the entertainment industry, all the Divas and movie Queens would have to stand aside, right?” ”

“What kind of relationship do you think she has with our boss?”

“I think she often comes to the company. Could it be that she’s here on behalf of our Boss?”

“I think it’s very possible!”

“...”

The two of them sat in the CEO’s private elevator and went straight to the top floor.

Ding Dong —

The elevator’s reminder sounded.

“Zhao Yang rubbed his eyes and said with a smile, “Our CEO ye is here.” ”

He knew that ye Zhuo would not be late.

“Hearing this, Mu Yourong hurriedly sat up straight and adjusted her posture. ”

She had to greet CEO ye in her best mental state!

CEO Ye was experienced and knowledgeable. A man like him would definitely have seen all kinds of women.

But only she could give CEO ye a different feeling!

She would definitely be able to make CEO ye see her in a different light!

“For today’s meeting, Mu Yourong not only meticulously dressed up, she even put on a beheading male lipstick. ”

Tap Tap Tap —

The footsteps were getting closer and closer.

“Mu Yourong was inexplicably a little nervous. She had dressed up so beautifully, and had made ample preparations. What if President Ye was a fat pig with a big head and big ears? ”

“However, judging from the degree of respect Zhao Yang had for President Ye, he was probably not some fat pig with a big head and big ears. ”

“On the contrary, he was very likely a young genius! ”

With this thought in mind

Two streaks of red secretly crept onto Mu Yourong’s face.

Which girl didn’t like Handsome Guys?

If it wasn’t for the fact that she already had fifth master Cen.

This CEO Ye was also a pretty good choice.

“After all, ZY was also an enterprise with a boundless future! ”

“Unfortunately, after having fifth master Cen, this CEO ye of Zy was destined to only be a male supporting actor in a television drama. ”

He would become an existence that served as a foil to her.

Mu Yourong puffed out her chest and raised her head to look outside the meeting room’s door.

“Through a layer of glass, Mu Yourong saw the familiar figure she had seen in the program department’s cubicle ten minutes ago. ”

Ye Zhuo?

Why was Ye Zhuo here?

How could a lowly person like ye Zhuo deserve to be in ZY’s conference room? FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Could it be that she was also here to discuss a live broadcast endorsement deal?

“If ye Zhuo could really win ZY’s endorsement deal, it would definitely cause a sensation in the live broadcast industry. ”

“After all, ZY produced air-conditioning clothes that could adjust the temperature. ”

There was no other company in the world that could replicate this kind of high-tech.

“Most importantly, ZY did not have any endorsers yet. ”

“Once the contract was successfully signed, Ye Zao would be Zy’s first spokesperson! ”

Unfortunately.

This was impossible.

“With her around, ye Zao did not even have the qualifications to step into this meeting room. ”

“Mu Yourong curled the corners of her lips and turned to look at Zhao Yang. Her eyes were filled with disgust. “President Zhao, Your ZY is a listed company after all. Why are you letting all kinds of random people in?” ”

Zhao Yang was stunned. He did not quite understand what Mu Yourong meant. “What random people?”

“Mu Yourong’s gaze turned to the door. “Look! Isn’t that it? I really don’t like that little streamer outside. If you still want me to cooperate with you, then get her as far away as possible!” ”

What right did a person like ye Zao have to sit at the same conference table as her?

It was too degrading!

“Zhao Yang looked over in confusion. When he saw that it was ye Zao, he hurriedly stood up and walked over. ”

“Without even thinking, he knew that Zhao Yang was definitely there to chase ye Zao away. ”

“After all, compared to her, what was ye Zao? ”

Could Ye Zao bring huge benefits to Zy?

“Mu Yourong pinched her earring, the corners of her mouth curling into a smug smile. ”

“If ye Zao knew that Zhao Yang was here to chase her away, he would definitely not accept it. He might even pester her and do something shameless. ”

There were so many ugly things to do.

“Mu Yourong looked outside calmly. Thinking about ye Zao’s embarrassing state, the smug look in her eyes became even more obvious. ”
