Translator: 549690339

“”Let’s go to the fifth floor first,”old Mrs. Cen replied. ”

“Although Old Mrs. Cen and ye Zao had made the decision, Cen Shaoqing did not have any objections. He pushed the shopping cart and followed behind the two of them like a little follower. ”

It was the 26th day of the twelfth lunar month. The New Year in the supermarket was very interesting.

“When they went from the fifth floor to the first floor, it was already twelve o’clock. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen looked at Ye Zhuo. “Ye, are you hungry? Why don’t we find a place to eat first and then continue shopping after we finish eating?” ”

“Sure.”Ye Zhuo nodded. “It just so happens that I’m a little hungry too.”

“Cen Shaoqing carried the big and small bags in his hands and said, “Grandma, go find a place to eat with Zhuozhuo first. I’ll send the things to the car.” ”

“”Okay, you go ahead.” ”

“After Cen Shaoqing left, Old Mrs. Cen and ye Zhuo discussed what to eat. ”

“Why don’t we eat Japanese food?”Ye Zhuo suggested.

“Old Mrs. Cen nodded. “Sure, I haven’t eaten Japanese food for a long time.” ”

The two of them walked to the Japanese food store together.

Cen Shaoqing went to the underground garage and put the things in the trunk.

“Today was the day Feng Xianxian moved from a cheap rental house to a bachelor apartment. After she moved here, she went to the nearby supermarket to buy things. ”

She did not expect to meet an impossible person in the basement.

Was this Cen Wuye?

“From Feng Xianxian’s point of view, she could just see the exquisite side profile of that person. ”

“He was carrying the things into the trunk. It was originally a very casual action, but when he did it, he exploded with a powerful aura that made people fearful. ”

Bang Bang Bang —

“At this moment, Feng Xianxian could clearly hear her own heartbeat. ”

It was CEN fifth master.

CEN fifth master that everyone in the capital wanted to climb up to.

“If it wasn’t for Ye Zhuo, CEN fifth master would already be her fiancé. ”

“Thinking of this, Feng Xianxian clenched her fists. ”

Slut!

Ye Zhuo was a slut who stole someone else’s fiancé.

“At this moment, a scene suddenly flashed in front of Feng Xianxian’s eyes. ”

Feng Xianxian picked up her phone and opened the photo album.

The two photos were still there.

These were the photos of ye Zao being kept by that old man and getting the old man to drive over to pick him up.

If Cen Shaoqing saw these two photos…

What would happen?

Feng Xianxian smiled.

It seemed that she had to think of a way to let Cen Shaoqing see these two photos.

“Cen Shaoqing put the things in the trunk and called Ye Zhuo. “Leader, where do you eat?” ”

“At a Japanese food shop on the sixth floor.”Ye Zhuo’s voice came from the other end of the phone. “Take the elevator from door No. 5. You can see this shop when you come out of the elevator on the right and turn left.”

“”Okay, I’ll be there right away.” ”

“As Cen Shaoqing spoke, he walked toward the elevator in the direction of door number five. ”

“Seeing ye Zhuo pick up the phone, Old Mrs. Cen asked curiously, “Who called?” ”

Ye Zhuo smiled and looked at Old Mrs. Cen. “The fifth girl called.”

“Hearing the nickname of the fifth girl, Old Mrs. Cen couldn’t help but laugh out loud. Only ye Zhuo dared to call Cen Shaoqing so openly. ”ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Cen Shaoqing on the other end of the phone:”…”

…

“Soon, it was the 28th of December. ”

Today was the day Lin Qingxuan brought his girlfriend home to meet her parents.

Xia Xiaoman woke up very early. Today was the first time she met Lin Qingxuan’s family. She took it very seriously and was currently sitting in front of the dressing table putting on makeup.

“An Lizi picked out a lipstick for Xia Xiaoman. “Mom, this color doesn’t only make it white, it’s also very generous. You can use this today.” ”

“Okay.”Xia Xiaoman reached out to take it.

“An lizi continued, “Mom, are you nervous?” ”

“”A little.”Although Xia Xiaoman really wanted to say that she wasn’t nervous, she was indeed a little nervous. ”

“An Lizi was also a little nervous. “Mom, why don’t I not go today? It’s your first time coming here today, and you brought me along. Wouldn’t that be bad?”Nowadays, many people cared about the woman bringing the child along. An Lizi was afraid of her presence, it would destroy the Lin family’s impression of Xia Xiaoman. ”

An Lizi had met Lin Qingxuan.

“She really liked this uncle, Lin Qingxuan. ”

It wasn’t easy for Xia Xiaoman to open her heart to accept another person. She didn’t want Xia Xiaoman to lose Lin Qingxuan because of her.

“”No.”Xia Xiaoman held an Lizi’s hand, “Lizi, you have to go. I’ve never hidden anything from your uncle Lin. If your uncle Lin’s family doesn’t accept your existence, then there’s no need for us to continue.” ”

Xia Xiaoman treated this relationship very seriously.

“Since she had decided to visit her parents, then she wouldn’t hide anything. ”

“If Lin Qingxuan wanted to marry her, then he and his family had to accept an Lizi. ”

“But mom…”

“Xia Xiaoman directly interrupted an Lizi’s unfinished words. “Lizi, you have to go. If you don’t go, I’ll call your uncle Lin right now and say that I won’t go either.” ”

“”Don’t call, don’t call!”An Lizi was shocked. “I’ll Go! I’ll Go!” ”

“Xia Xiaoman was satisfied and said, “Go and change your clothes. Your Uncle Lin will be here soon.” ”

“Okay.”An Lizi nodded.

Lin Qingxuan arrived as soon as the mother and daughter changed their clothes.

They got into the car.

“Lin Qingxuan said, “Xiaoman, Lizi, there are a lot of people in our family. Don’t be nervous when we arrive.” ”

“An lizi asked curiously, “Uncle Lin, how many people are there in your family?” ”

“Lin Qingxuan said, “I have three brothers and a younger brother. Brother, sister-in-law, brother, sister-in-law, nephew, niece, and daughter-in-law. There are more than thirty people in total.” ”

More than thirty people?

“An Lizi was shocked by this number. “Then, then are they all here today?” ”

“Lin Qingxuan nodded. “Yes, they’re all here.” ”

“After saying that, Lin Qingxuan continued, “But Lizi, don’t be nervous. You might even meet someone you know today.” ”

“An lizi asked curiously, “Who is it?” ”

Lin Qingxuan remained mysterious. “You’ll know when we get there.”

Xia Xiaoman did not say anything. She planned to give an lizi an unexpected surprise.

“Not long after, the car arrived at the Lin family manor. ”

“They had long known that Lin Qingxuan’s family background was not ordinary. Now that they saw the Lin family living in the manor, Xia Xiaoman and an Lizi were not too surprised. ”

Everyone from the Lin family had gathered in the main hall to wait for Lin Qingxuan.

“At this moment, when they heard the sound of the car engine, Old Lady Lin stood up excitedly. “He’s Here!” ”

The rest of the Lin family members were also very excited.

Lin Qingxuan led his men to the main hall.

“Seeing so many people, it would be a lie to say that she wasn’t nervous. An Lizi swallowed her saliva with difficulty. Suddenly, she saw a familiar figure in the crowd. ”

Holy Sh * t!

Was that ye Zao?

“Scorch!”
