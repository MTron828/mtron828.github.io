“Chapter 2007: 420: Trash! Miss ye will always be here, and her faith will never end! 3”

“It had followed ye Zao all the way here, and it knew how difficult ye Zao’s life was. ”

“People only knew that the 18-year-old miss ye was famous all over the world, but they did not know the sadness behind this name. ”

“It’s also my fault.”Ye Zao looked into the distance.

“”What?”Yi Ling looked at Ye Zao, her eyes full of confusion. ”

She did not understand why ye Zao would say something to blame her.

Ye Zao pursed his lips and did not speak.

The eighteen-year-old ye Zao was too confident in himself.

She thought that there would never be a traitor by her side.

Little did she know.

The people closest to her actually wished for her to die every day.

“Yi Ling continued, “Da Zao Zao, since you know that the eight great families betrayed you, why haven’t you killed them?” ”

“With ye Zhuo’s ability, killing the people of the eight great clans was as easy as crushing an ant. ”

“I haven’t found out who the mole is.”Ye Zhuo only suspected that there was a mole in the eight great clans.

“Yi ling narrowed her eyes, “Great burning, you mean that the eight great clans didn’t all betray you?” ”

“”To be precise, it should be one of the eight clan leaders.”Ye burning said. ”

“If the eight great clans had all betrayed her, then the current situation would not be like this! ”

“”Then who is he? The second clan leader?”Yi Ling said, “Among the eight clan leaders, he is the most stingy. He is so stingy that he can’t even bear to give me a hundred spirit fruit! It must be him!” ”

“”Before we find conclusive evidence, every single one of them is a suspect.”Ye Zao said. ”

“Yi Ling said angrily, “When we find that traitor, we must cut him into pieces! Tear him into pieces!” ”

“Let’s go.”Ye Zao turned his eyes slightly.

Yi Ling immediately flapped her wings and followed ye Zao.

On the other side.

Ye clan base.

Ye Lan had been preparing for the day of the general election these few days.

She had gathered everyone from the Ye family’s base together.

“Ever since ye Zao’s accident, this was the first time ye Lan had gathered everyone together for a meeting. ”

Everyone was discussing animatedly. They did not know what ye Lan wanted to do.

“Ye Lan stood on the rostrum and looked at the noisy crowd below the stage. She raised her hands lightly and said, “Everyone, quiet down.” ”

Most of the people below the stage were ye Zao’s old subordinates.

They were very loyal to ye Zao.

“Although everyone was quite unconvinced of Ye Lan, at this moment, they could only quiet down and look at Ye Lan on the stage. ”

Ye Lan looked at the people below the stage who had quieted down. Her eyes were filled with satisfaction.

“”Next, I want to announce something to everyone. From today onwards, our Ye clan base will officially be renamed as the Qiu Clan Base!” ”

“As soon as she finished speaking, someone immediately carried in a majestic plaque from outside the door. ” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

On the plaque were four large words:

Qiu family base.

The day of the general election was about to arrive. She had to let Qiu di see the heart of her city.

Changing the ye family base into the Qiu family base was only her first step.

Qiu family base!

“As soon as these words were said, the audience instantly went into chaos. ”

“”The Ye clan’s base was painstakingly established by Miss Ye. Although Miss Ye is no longer here, the Ye clan’s base is also Miss Ye’s! Ye Lan, don’t you think that you’re going too far by doing this?” ”

“Ye Lan! You have no right to change the name of the base!”

Who the hell was Qiu Di?

What right did she have to occupy ye Zao’s base?

“In order to rise to a higher position, ye Lan actually used ye Zao’s territory to curry favor with Qiu Di. It was simply too disgusting! ”

“I don’t agree!”

Some people were so angry that their eyes were red.

They didn’t understand why ye Zao left just like that!

“If ye Zao was here, would ye Lan Dare to be so arrogant? ”

“An old man with white hair stood out from the crowd, he pointed at Ye Lan and said in a pained manner, “Ye Lan, I’ve always thought that you’re a good child with a conscience! But who knew that I was actually blind to see the wrong person! ! Ask yourself, do you still have a conscience ! If it weren’t for Miss Ye back then, you would still be a homeless orphan until now ! Yet, you treat miss ye like this in the blink of an eye ! Aren’t you afraid that Miss Ye will be disappointed?” ”

Perhaps even ye Zao himself did not expect that the person she regarded as her younger sister would betray her!

Not to mention ye Zao.

“No one present had expected that one day, ye Lan would become like this. ”

“Hearing these words, Ye LAN’s expression changed. Her proud expression was replaced by a look of shame, “Dai Sheng! Don’t take advantage of your old age to flaunt your seniority here! So what if I’m a homeless orphan? There’s no need for you to remind me here that I’m a homeless orphan. A homeless orphan. Today, I still stand here and become a guide for people like you who have a good family!” ”
