Translator: 549690339

Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Yes.”

Yes.

Holy shit!

Ye Zao was really one!

These two siblings were too amazing. One was the top scorer in the arts while the other was the top scorer in science.

“It was one thing for them to have two top scorers, but these two were actually the school Belle and the school Belle. ”

What kind of godly genes were these?

“Fat Tiger hurriedly stood up. “Hello, Little Sister. I’m Fat Tiger. You Can Call Me Brother Tiger.” ”

“”Little sister, I’m dog two, Brother Dog.” ”

“”Little sister, I’m Mosquito, brother Mosquito.” ”

“”Brother Tiger, Brother Dog, brother Mosquito.”Ye Zhuo stood up. ”

“Fat Tiger, dog two, and Li Wen had never experienced the feeling of having a little sister before. Suddenly having a little sister made the three of them especially excited. “Little sister, quickly sit down.” ”

Ye Zhuo leaned over and sat down.

Lin Ze immediately brought the dessert in front of Ye Zhuo. “This is their new product. Have a taste.”

Ye Zhuo was a person who couldn’t move around when he saw the dessert. He immediately picked up the dessert.

“”Younger sister, which Department are you from?”Fatty Tiger asked. ”

“Chemistry Department.”

“Fatty tiger said in surprise, “Chemistry department? Then there must be very few girls in your department.” ”

“Under normal circumstances, very few girls would choose the chemistry department. ”

“It’s not too bad.”Ye Zhuo thought for a moment. “There are a total of eight girls in our class.”

...

“In the blink of an eye, it was the sixth day of the first month. ”

“Ye Shu, Lin Jincheng, Ye Sen, Ye Zhuo, and Lin Ze, the family of five, set off for Yun Jing. ”

“Four hours later, the plane landed at Yun Jing Airport. ”

The temperature in Yun Jing was higher than that in the capital.

“The capital was now a vast expanse of whiteness, and the temperature had reached-10 degrees Celsius. The lowest temperature in yunjing was only 15 degrees Celsius. ”

“After a long time, Lin Jincheng stood at Yunjing Airport once again, his heart filled with emotion. ”

He had come to Yunjing a year ago for the sake of ye Zhuo’s background.

“At that time, he had no time to care about the changes in yunjing. ”

“Looking at it from a new perspective, the changes in Yunjing were really too great. ”

High-rise buildings were springing up like mushrooms after a rain.

“Because they had been arranged in advance, someone came to pick them up outside the airport. ”

“Not long after, the car stopped at the entrance of the residential area that ye Zao had rented before. ”

It was a very ordinary residential area.

“Lin Ze had never lived in such a residential area before, so he couldn’t help but feel a little sad. What kind of life had his mother and sister been living in. ”

Especially when he remembered that ye Shu had once lived in the basement.

“If even the neighborhood was like this, wouldn’t the basement’s environment be even worse? ”

“The more Lin ze thought about it, the more uncomfortable he felt. ”

“In fact, he had been to this neighborhood before. ”

“But at that time, he didn’t know that his mother, uncle, and sister lived here. ”

The five of them walked in and soon arrived at the door of their house.

Ye Shu took out the key and opened the door.

“The house was very clean. The windows on the balcony were open, and there was no strange smell in the air. The plants in the flower pots were also very vibrant. ”

Lin Jincheng quietly sized up the furnishings in the house.

“The space was very small, but the decorations were very warm. It was actually not inferior to the Lin family’s large manor. ” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Ye Shu smiled and looked at Ye Zhuo. “The house is still the same. There’s not even a speck of dust. It must be your aunt Lian who often comes to clean.”

Ye Zao nodded. “Aunt Lian basically comes to visit once every three days.”

“Who’s Aunt Lian?”Lin Ze asked curiously.

“Ye Shu explained, “Aunt Lian is my best sister. She has helped me a lot over the years. Let’s clean up at home today and visit your Aunt Lian’s house tomorrow.” ”

“In order to give Zhou Yuelian a surprise, ye Shu specifically did not tell Zhou Yuelian and the others that they would be coming back today. ”

Lin Ze nodded.

“Lin Jincheng said, “We should really thank her.”He had disappeared for so many years. Without Zhou Yuelian’s help, Ye Shu and the others really did not know how they would survive. ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Oh right, Mom, how are we going to sleep tonight?” ”

There were only three rooms in the house.

There were five people now.

“Ye Sen said, “That’s simple. Ah Ze will sleep with me tonight. You guys can still sleep in your own rooms.” ”

Lin Ze nodded in agreement.

Ye Shu went to make the bed while Lin Jincheng helped clean up.

Ye Sen took a call and left in a hurry.

“In the blink of an eye, there were only four people left in the house. ”

...

At the same time.

Song family.

Song Shiyu stood in front of the French window in the study and looked down at the scenery below him. His eyes were filled with a layer of haze that could not be dispersed.

“At that moment, there was a knock on the door. ”

“”Come in,”song Shiyu said without turning his head. ”

The assistant pushed the door open and came in. “Boss.”

“”Speak,”song Shiyu said in a deep voice. ”

“The assistant continued, “Miss Ye is back.” ”
