“When she saw Li Xiang walk out of the aircraft in one piece and stand in front of her, mother Li was stunned! ”

This was her daughter!

It was nothing!

Li Xiang was fine.

Li Xiang had come back alive!

Was she hallucinating? Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Mother Li stood there in a daze. She had lost consciousness and her eyes were filled with disbelief.

Was the person standing there really her daughter?

Li Xiang ran over and hugged mother Li. “Mom! I’m back.”

Only after being hugged by Li Xiang did mother Li React.

It wasn’t an illusion.

It wasn’t an illusion.

She was back.

Her daughter was back!

“Think! Think!”Mother Li cried out in excitement.

She thought that she would never see Li Xiang again.

She did not expect...

“She did not expect that just when she was close to despair, the heavens would let her see hope again. ”

“Mother Li never dreamed that in her lifetime, the two of them would be able to meet again. ”

“Li Xiang patted mother Li’s back gently and comforted her, “Mom, Don’t cry. I’m fine now, right?” ”

“Although Li Xiang said that she was fine,. ”

Mother Li still could not control herself.

Five days.

“For five whole days, there was nothing on Mars. How did Li Xiang spend these five days? ”

“”Let me think, you’ve suffered!” ”

“Li Xiang smiled and said, “Mom, I’m really fine. Just treat it as if I went on a trip for these five days.” ”

“At this moment, Li Xiang’s father walked out from inside. ”

“When he saw that mother and daughter wanted to use it together, father Li stood rooted to the ground. ”

PA —

The phone in his hand dropped to the ground.

“”Dad.”Hearing the noise, Li Xiang looked up. ”

“Li Xiang’s father pursed his lips. He wanted to respond to Li Xiang, but he couldn’t say anything. ”

It was like a fishbone stuck in his throat. It was especially uncomfortable.

“After a long while, Li Xiang’s father finally reacted. He walked to Li Xiang’s side and patted Li Xiang’s shoulder. “It’s good that you’re back. It’s good that you’re back.” ”

The scene of the family reunion was very touching.

“Seeing this scene, Tian Zhifang, who had walked out from the side, was stunned. She turned to look at her assistant and said, “That... that’s their daughter, Li Xiang?” ”

The assistant beside her was also stunned. He stared at this scene with his mouth agape. “It... It’s Li Xiang!”

It really was Li Xiang!

“Tian Zhifang couldn’t react in time. She then turned to look at her assistant and said hopefully, “Li Xiang is already back. That zifei must have returned safely as well. Little Wu, don’t you agree?” ”

He would.

He definitely would.

“After all, Li Xiang and Yu Zifei were on the same aircraft. ”

“So, Yu Zifei must be fine. ”

“The assistant was stared at by Tian Zhifang. For a moment, he didn’t know how to answer. If he was right, what if something happened to Yu Zifei? ”

“After all, the only person standing in front of everyone was Li Xiang. ”

“But if she said anything wrong, Tian Zhifang would definitely be heartbroken. ”

“Therefore, she couldn’t say anything now. The assistant turned his gaze to Li Xiang and shouted, “Li Xiang.” ”

Li Xiang looked up and smiled. “Qin Keru!”

The two of them were both assistants and graduates of the same school. They usually had a very good relationship.

Qin Keru was really happy that Li Xiang could return safely.

“When she heard Li Xiang’s voice again, Qin Keru’s eyes turned red and she jogged over. “Li Xiang, you’re finally back!” ”

Li Xiang wiped away Qin Keru’s tears. “Why are you crying? I’m Fine Again!”

Qin keru sized up Li Xiang.

“Although it had only been five days, the changes on Li Xiang’s body were not small at all. The color of his skin was very bad, and he had lost a lot of weight. ”

“Mother Li kept on nagging, “I’ve lost weight, I’ve lost weight!”She wanted to go back and give Li Xiang a good tonic. ”

“Li Xiang smiled and said, “There’s no need for a tonic. It’s just right. It saves me from losing weight.” ”

“Usually, if one wanted to lose weight, they would not be able to achieve such an effect! ”

This could be considered a blessing in disguise.

“”You Child, at what time are you still joking!”Li Xiang had lost so much weight. As a mother, it was too late for her to feel sorry for her, but Li Xiang could still smile. ”

How heartless.

“”Mom, I’m serious.”Li Xiang continued, “I think my body is just right now.” ”

“Seeing this scene, Tian Zhifang was trembling. ”

Li Xiang was back. Where was Yu Zifei? Where was her son?

Where did Yu Zifei go?

Could it be...

Yu Zifei was the only one who died?

No!

No!

Yu Zifei would be fine.

“Although she comforted herself in her heart that Yu Zifei would be fine, Tian Zhifang still couldn’t control herself and almost burst into tears. ”
