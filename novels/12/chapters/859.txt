“Song Chenyu said a little embarrassedly, “That’s not good, right? Moreover, the watermelon is so heavy, how can we let the two of you come? The two of US should also participate.” ”

Song Yiwan nodded. “I think Chenyu is very right.”

Lu Qi looked at song Chenyu. “Food is the most important thing for the people. You Cook is the most important thing. How can you have the strength to work if you’re not full?”

“Wang Xuancheng smiled and said, “Lu Qi is right. The two of you should go back quickly.”This kind of variety show showed one’s character and grace. If song Chenyu and song Yiwan were left to do heavy work at this time, they would definitely be criticized badly! ”

“If they let song Chenyu and the others go back, after the show was broadcast, it would attract a wave of favorability. ”

“Song Chenyu continued, “It’s still early, so there’s no rush to cook. There are so many watermelons. Just the two of you won’t be able to do it. How about this? The four of us will divide the work and carry the watermelons back? With the men and women working together, it won’t be tiring to do the work.” ”

“Although song Chenyu had never participated in a variety show before, she knew that she couldn’t go back to rest at this time. ”

She had to stay behind to share the joys and sorrows of her teammates.

Only in this way would she be able to pull people along.

“Moreover, she was injured when she mowed the grass just now. ”

Working with injuries would win the sympathy of the audience even more.

“When that time came, she might even make it onto the trending searches. ”

Song Chenyu did not want to waste this chance to make it onto the trending searches.

“After saying that, song chenyu continued, “I’ll be in a group with Lu Qi. Yi Wan, you’ll be in a group with Xuancheng.” ”

“Song Yiwan nodded. “Sure, no problem.” ”

The few of them began to work together to carry the watermelons back.

Carrying watermelons was much more tiring than mowing the lawn.

“Three watermelons would weigh 50 to 60 kilograms. The boys could still bear it, but Song Chenyu and song Yiwan had only taken a few steps before they had to rest. ”

On the red team’s side.

“Looking at the watermelons that had been picked, Wei Xingzhi also suggested that the two girls should go back first. This kind of heavy work should be done by the boys. ”

“Ye Zhuo looked at the watermelons in the ground, then raised his head to look at the Sun. “If the two of US go back, there are so many watermelons. How long will the two of you have to move until? We have to think of a way.” ”

“”It’s fine,”Chang Yu answered with a smile, “Teacher Wei and I are working together, and we will be done moving very soon. The two of you should go back and rest for a while! We have been busy for the whole afternoon. Both of US men are exhausted, not to mention you two little girls.” ”

“At this moment, a rumbling sound came from not far away. ”

Ye Zhuo narrowed his eyes and turned around to walk back.

Wei Xingzhi was stunned.

Chang Yu was also stunned.

Ye Zao went back just like that?

Even Yin Wei was a little stunned.

“After spending an entire afternoon with ye Zao, she realized that ye Zao was not that kind of delicate little girl. ”

Perhaps she was really tired.

“Yin Wei turned to look at Wei Xingzhi and Chang Yu. “Teacher Wei, Chang Yu, Ye Zi might be too tired. Shall we start the three of us?” ”

Tired?

“After working for the entire afternoon, who wouldn’t be tired? ”

They had only casually asked ye Zao to go back.

They hadn’t expected ye Zao to really go back...

He wasn’t polite at all.

It was different with a backer!

“Once ye Zao went back, he would have one less person to work with. With so many watermelons, how long would they have to work? ”

“The two of them had a good impression of ye Zao when they were cutting the grass, but it instantly disappeared without a trace. ”

The people from the directing team were also a little surprised. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

None of them had expected ye Zao to suddenly leave.

A few cameramen immediately followed ye Zao’s footsteps.

“Wei Xingzhi slowed down and looked at Yin Wei. “Wei Wei, why don’t you go back and rest too? Chang Yu and I will be fine here.” ”

“Chang Yu nodded. “Teacher Wei is right. Wei Wei, you should go back and rest too. After all, Ye Zi has already gone back.” ”

“Yin Wei smiled and said, “There’s no need. I’ll stay behind and help. Then, we’ll go back together.” ”

“Ye Zhuo did not go back. Instead, he came to a small farm yard. ”

The rumbling sound just now came from here.

“To be precise, it came from a tractor in the yard. ”

Ye Zhuo walked up and knocked on the door. “Is Anyone Home?”

“The camera crew did not know what ye Zao was trying to do, so they pushed the camera over. ”

“At that moment, the door opened. ”

The person who opened the door was an old man with white hair.

“”Hello, Old Man.” ”

“The program team had to communicate with the villagers before filming in the village, so when the old man saw the camera behind ye Zao, he was not surprised. He smiled and said, “Hello, little girl. Do you need something?” ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Uncle, I just heard the sound of a tractor. May I borrow your family’s tractor?” ”
