“Cen Shaoqing and ye Zao had agreed to Hypnotize Ye Zao at 11 o’clock. He went to pick ye Zao up at 10:30, but ye Zao suddenly had the urge to drive, so he drove himself here in advance. ”

They drove madly and arrived at the Cen Manor in less than 15 minutes.

“”I wanted to drive, so I came here by myself.”Ye Zao smiled and said, “Grandma Cen, have you eaten?” ”

“”I have.”Old Mrs. Cen nodded and said with a smile, “If I knew you would come so early, I would have waited for you to eat with me.” ”

“I brought some cake for you.”Ye Zhuo handed the bag in his hand to old Mrs. Cen.

“”Your mother made it herself, right?”Old Mrs. Cen asked. ”

“”Yes, she did.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “I love eating the cake your mother made personally!” ”

“Not only was ye Shu a good cook, but her glutinous rice cake cooking skills were also unprecedented. ”

“Every time, old Mrs. Cen could eat a lot. ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “And this, this is the healthy dog food that my mother made for Da Liang.” ”

“Because she had a dog at home, ye Shu often made dog food herself. ”

“When she learned that ye Zao had drunk and brought back a samoyed, she made more. ”

“Really? Your mother even made dog food for Da Liang?”Old Mrs. Cen asked in surprise.

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “That’s it.”

“Hearing this, Da Liang seemed to understand. She ran over from not far away and rubbed her dog head against ye Zhuo’s leg. She began to act coquettishly. ”

Ye Zhuo stroked her dog head. “Da Liang.”

“Woof!”Big Beauty barked at Ye Zao.

“”Zao Zao, let me tell you. Big Beauty is very smart!”Old Mrs. Cen held ye Zao’s hand and said somewhat excitedly. ”

“What do you mean?”Ye Zao asked.

“Old Mrs. Cen immediately demonstrated to Ye Zao. “Big Beauty, sit.” ”

Big Beauty immediately sat on the ground and stared at Old Mrs. Cen with a pair of cute big eyes.

“Old Lady Cen said again, “Lie.” ”

“After receiving instructions, big beauty immediately lied down on the ground. ”

“Shake hands.”Old Lady Cen placed her hand in front of big beauty and put her dog paw on Old Lady Cen’s hand.

“My Great great-grandson is awesome!”Old Lady Cen rewarded Big Beauty with a freeze-drying.

“After receiving the freeze-drying, big beauty left in satisfaction. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen turned to look at Ye Zhuo again. “What do you think, Yezi? Da Liang is pretty and smart, right?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Smart!”

“At this moment, Old Mrs. Cen received a message and looked up at Ye Zhuo. “Yezi, Old Mrs. Zhou sent me a wechat message. I’m going to take da Liang on a blind date. Go upstairs and look for Shaoqing. He’s at the gym now.” ”

“”Okay, you go ahead.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. ”

Old Mrs. Cen found pretty and left with her.

Ye Zhuo sent old Mrs. Cen out.

“After sending Old Mrs. Cen out, Ye Zhuo walked upstairs. ”

The Cen family’s Gym was on the third floor. Ye Zhuo had just walked to the corridor when he saw Cen Shaoqing lifting a barbell through the glass.

He was half-naked and could clearly see eight strong abdominal muscles and the perfect mermaid line.

“Tiny beads of sweat crawled out from his pores, adding a sense of charm. ”

This scene was very striking. Even a cold person like ye Zhuo was a little stunned when he saw this scene.

“At this moment, Cen Shaoqing looked back slightly and met ye Zhuo’s gaze. The corners of his mouth curled slightly. ”

“Immediately, he put down the barbell in his hand, picked up the white towel on the side, wiped his sweat and walked out of the door. ”

“How is it?”Cen Shaoqing walked to ye Zao and opened his thin lips.

“How is what?”Ye Zao was stunned.

“Cen Shaoqing leaned forward slightly and said in a low voice, “Are you satisfied with my figure, Madam?” ”

The two of them were very close to each other. The warm breath sprayed on ye Zao’s ears like a weak electric current.

“At this moment, ye Zao’s heartbeat accelerated and he almost couldn’t control himself. “I can barely see.” ”

“You can only barely see?”Cen Shaoqing raised his eyebrows slightly.

Ye Zao looked up calmly. “What else can I do?”

“Cen Shaoqing reached out and covered her hand. Then, he brought her hand to his abdominal muscles. “Then, Madam, try to feel how it feels.” ”

It was a little hard. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The texture was clear.

“Ye Zao pressed hard, but he found that he couldn’t move it at all. ”

Are all men’s muscles this hard?

“How is it?”Cen Shaoqing’s tone was low.

“It’s okay.”Ye Zao’s ears were slightly red as he seemed to have thought of something.

“Cen Shaoqing stopped teasing her and continued, “Didn’t we agree that I would pick you up? Why are you here by yourself?” ”
