“Mother Zhou very well concealed the greed in her eyes and said with a smile, “So what if you came? What’s the point of bringing gifts!”” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Just accept it.”Cen Yuyan stuffed the gift box into mother Zhou’s hands.

Mother Zhou still wanted to refuse.

“Zhou Rui said with a smile, “Mom, this is Yuyan’s filial piety.””

“Mother Zhou smiled and said, “Since it’s Yuyan’s filial piety, then I won’t stand on ceremony.””

“You don’t have to stand on ceremony with me.”

“It was mother Zhou who had been talking to Cen Yuyan the whole time. Father Zhou sat on the sofa and didn’t say a single word. The whole process was like a backdrop. Cen Yuyan found an opportunity to call Zhou Rui out, she said with some worry, “Zhou Rui, is uncle not satisfied with me?””

Zhou Rui was stunned. “You’re so good and so careful. How can my father not be satisfied with you? Don’t let your imagination run wild!”

Cen Yuyan frowned. “But I don’t think uncle has said a single word.”

“Zhou rui smiled and explained, “My father is that kind of taciturn character. Don’t look at him as if he hasn’t said a single word. In fact, he’s very satisfied with you in his heart! Maybe he even has a name for his future grandson.””

“Hearing this, Cen Yuyan said somewhat embarrassedly, “Really?””

“Of course it’s true.”

“Hearing Zhou Rui say this, Cen Yuyan felt much more at ease, and the two returned to the house again.”

It was soon time for lunch.

“Mother Zhou and the nanny had prepared lunch together, making a table full of dishes.”

It was not until the afternoon that Cen Yuyan proposed to leave.

“Mother Zhou held Cen Yuyan’s hand reluctantly. “Yuyan, you have to come to our house often in the future. I like you very much the moment I see you.””

“”Don’t worry, I will.”Cen Yuyan nodded.”

“Mother Zhou continued, “Oh right, Yuyan, I still have something to give you. Don’t be in a hurry to leave.”After saying that, mother Zhou walked into the room.”

“Zhou Rui chimed in, “Mom, what good stuff do you want to give Yuyan? I’m telling you, you can’t be biased.””

“So what if I’m biased!”

“Zhou Rui tilted his head to look at Cen Yuyan and said with a bitter face, “Yuyan, my mom is a classic case of having a daughter-in-law and forgetting her son.””

Cen Yuyan lowered her head in embarrassment.

She originally thought that the Zhou family’s parents would have a lot of opinions about her.

She didn’t expect that this meeting would be so smooth.

“Not long after, mother Zhou walked out of the room with a red cloth in her hand.”

“Mother Zhou walked in front of Cen Yuyan and removed the red cloth layer by layer. Not long after, a jade bracelet was revealed from the red cloth.”

“Cen Yuyan was used to seeing good things. With a glance, she could tell that this was a worthless fake.”

A worthless fake. Was It Worth Mother Zhou’s attention?

Or did she misjudge the Zhou Family?

Cen Yuyan narrowed her eyes.

“Mother Zhou held Cen Yuyan’s hand, with red eyes, she said, “Yuyan, this jade bracelet was given to me by Rui Rui’s grandmother. Now, I’m passing it to you. In the future, we will be a family. This family doesn’t speak in two different ways. In fact, our Zhou family only developed in Rui Rui’s hands. In the past, we were farmers digging for food in the fields. This bracelet is a fake. It’s not worth anything at all! “I know that rich young ladies like you will definitely not like this kind of thing! “But in our Zhou family, it is not as simple as a bracelet. It represents the Zhou family’s inheritance!””

“In fact, this bracelet was not passed down from Zhou Rui’s grandmother at all. This was why mother Zhou bought three of them at a street stall for 100 yuan.”

It was to fool Cen Yuyan.

Mother Zhou was very cheeky. She could not bear to spend money to buy a real jade bracelet for Cen Yuyan.

“Hence, she made up such a lie.”

“How could Cen Yuyan see through Mother Zhou’s tricks? She was extremely touched. “Auntie, don’t worry. I will definitely treasure this bracelet.””

“Good child.”Mother Zhou nodded in satisfaction and helped CEN Yuyan put the bracelet on her hand.

“Then, the Zhou family’s parents personally sent Cen Yuyan into the car and instructed Zhou Rui to drive carefully.”

“Looking at the car that disappeared into the distance, the Zhou family’s parents removed all the disguises on their faces. The two of them walked back into the house and opened Cen Yuyan’s gift.”

“Cen Yuyan gave Father Zhou a set of antiques, while she gave mother Zhou a set of luxury accessories.”

“Mother Zhou sighed, “In the end, it’s the Cen family’s fourth young miss. She’s really generous. She’s much better than that wretched girl! Our son is really capable, unlike that wretched girl!””

“Father Zhou looked at mother Zhou and continued, “This matter is all thanks to Chenyu. If it wasn’t for Chenyu pulling strings, Rui Rui Rui wouldn’t have been able to get to know Cen Yuyan. So don’t keep talking about that wretched girl, keep talking about her!””
