Translator: 549690339

The Mu family.

Mu Yourong had been staring at her phone waiting for a call.

“Time passed by minute by minute, but she had not received any calls. ”

What was going on?

It was already past two in the morning.

Could it be that the group had not succeeded yet?

“Mu Yourong paced back and forth in the room, her face full of anxiety. ”

Could something have gone wrong?

Ye Shu was just a middle-aged woman with no strength to tie a chicken. She had specially asked Liu Xiaodie to find eight men!

“So, there shouldn’t be any problems. ”

She just needed to wait for a reply with peace of mind.

This time!

She had to make ye Shu and her daughter lose their reputation in Yun Jing.

“Thirty minutes later, Mu Yourong finally received a call. ”

It was from the other party.

It had definitely been done!

“Mu Yourong’s eyes lit up, and a smile appeared on her face. She quickly picked up the call. “When will the photos be sent over?” ”

“It was unknown what was said on the other end of the call, but Mu Yourong’s face turned pale. Her smile froze on the corner of her mouth, and she was so angry that she smashed her phone against the wall. “Trash! A bunch of trash!” ”

Mu Yourong had never thought that her plan would fail.

She had never thought that ye Shu would be able to escape from the hands of eight men!

Just what was going on?

She had thought that she could destroy ye Shu’s reputation in one fell swoop and make her life a living hell. She had never thought that she would end up with nothing.

Mu Yourong’s facial features were twisted into a ball and her entire body was trembling.

“After a long while, Mu Yourong pulled out the phone card and threw it into the toilet to flush it. ”

“Seeing the phone card disappear into the toilet, Mu Yourong narrowed her eyes. ”

“This time, she was lucky enough to let ye Shu escape. Next time, Ye Shu would not be so lucky! ”

“”System, help me check ye Shu’s current situation and her schedule for this period of time!” ”

There was no reply in her mind

Mu Yourong bit her lip. Only then did she realize that the system had already disappeared.

When would the system be able to return?

No!

She could not lose the system!

Absolutely Not!

“Mu Yourong tightly gripped the edge of the basin, because her knuckles had already turned slightly white from overexerting herself. ”

“In the blink of an eye, the next day arrived. ”

“Ye Shu was still the same as before. She woke up early in the morning, as if the incident from last night had never happened. ” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

She went to the kitchen and found ye Zao already cooking porridge.

“”Zao Zao, why are you up so early? Come out quickly, I’ll Cook!”Ye Shu put on an apron. ”

“Ye Zao turned his eyes slightly and said with a smile, “I’ve already made it. We Can Eat Now.” ”

“Ye Shu knew what ye Zao was worried about. She looked at ye Zao and said seriously, “Zao Zao, don’t worry. Mom Is Fine Now!” ”

“Ye Zao continued, “Mom, from today onwards, there will be a special driver to take you to and from work.” ”

“”Okay.”In order to make ye Zao Feel at ease, Ye Shu nodded. ”

“Not long after, Ye Sen also got up. ”

The family of three sat at the dining table and ate.

“Ye Zao took a bite of his fried dough stick. “Mom, why don’t I sign you up for a Sanda Class? Practicing Sanda can not only train your body, but it can also improve your ability to defend yourself.” ”

“Right now, Ye Shu’s value was increasing day by day. Even without mu yourong, there might still be others in the future. ”

“It was easy to dodge an open spear, but difficult to defend against an arrow in the dark. ”

Only when one was strong could one truly be strong!

“Ye Sen nodded in agreement. “I think what Zao Zao said makes sense. Sister, it’s better to rely on yourself than anyone else! What if one day, Zao Zao and I aren’t by your side? What will you do?” ”

Ye Shu hesitated for a moment and then nodded.

“After what happened last night, Ye Shu was also extremely afraid. ”

“If ye Zao and Ye Sen hadn’t arrived in time last night, the consequences would have been unimaginable. ”

“As a mother, it was fine if she couldn’t protect ye Zao, but she couldn’t drag ye Zao down either. ”

She had to work hard to become stronger!

“Therefore, after dinner, ye Zao accompanied ye Shu to sign up for the adult Sanda class. ”

“Ye Sen also wanted to go with her. Ye Shu smiled and said, “Why are you following me? Go and do your work! The company is so busy now!” ”

“Ye Zao said, “Uncle, I will accompany my mother there. It is meaningless for you to follow her there. On the contrary, it is a waste of time.” ”

“The incident last night still left ye Sen with lingering fear. He continued, “Zao Zao, call me if there is anything.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded.

...

“With the help of Li Qiandong, the MU group, which had already been on the right track, withdrew their investments overnight. At the same time, a mysterious force was suppressing them in the dark. ”

“President Mu is in trouble! The land in the South has been snatched by the Zhang Group!”
