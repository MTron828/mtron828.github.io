“I checked the score with Zhonghua.”

“Okay.”Zhou Yuelian nodded.

On the other side.

Lin family manor.

“After receiving Zhou Yuelian’s call, ye Shu called ye Zhonghua. “Zhonghua, did you know that Your Sister Shasha got first place in the city?” ”

“I know.”Ye Zhonghua smiled and said.

“That’s great! Now your Aunt Lian doesn’t have to worry about Shasha anymore!”Ye Shu was really happy for Zhou Yuelian’s family.

“Back when she was in Yunjing, she might not have been able to survive without Zhou Yuelian’s help. ”

“Although she and Zhou Yuelian were not blood-related sisters, the friendship between them was better than many blood-related sisters. ”

Time passed quickly.

“In the blink of an eye, two months had passed. ”

Lin Shasha had applied for a university in the capital. Her parents had sent her to school and also came to visit the Lin family.

This was the first time they had come to the Lin family manor.

“Although they had long heard that Lin Jin city was very rich and that the Lin family was very powerful in the capital, seeing it with one’s own eyes and hearing it with one’s own ears were two different things. ”

“Zhou Yuelian was extremely shocked. “Ah Shu, your house is too big!” ”

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “Sister Lian, you have to stay in the capital for a few more days this time.” ”

“Okay!”Zhou Yuelian nodded.

“In the next few days, Ye Shu and Lin Jincheng accompanied Lin Jinshui and Zhou Yuelian to visit all the famous scenic spots in the capital. ”

“On the day of the report, Ye Zhuo accompanied Lin Shasha. ”

“Looking at the welcoming slogan on the campus gate and the freshmen coming and going around her, Lin Shasha said emotionally, “Zhuo Zhuo, I really didn’t expect to be able to step into the university gate in this life.”That feeling.., only those who had experienced it would understand, such as the current Lin Shasha. ”

“Ye burning said with a smile, “Sister Shasha, there are many things you can’t imagine in life. There is nothing you can’t do, only things you can’t imagine.”As long as you work hard, time will give you the results you want. ” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Lin Shasha held ye burning’s hand tightly. “Burning, it’s good to have a friend like you.” ”

...

“After more than two months, almost three months of hard work, Professor Feng and director Ma finally succeeded in developing a light-speed spaceship. ”

Professor Cara could not wait to release this news and announce that country C would land in Europe on September 8th.

“As soon as this news was released, the entire technology network was in an uproar. ”

-LOUR GREATrCOUNTRYnCry c is mighAre are we finally going to landEuroperoIe? i’m so excited! ]

[ what’s so great about the speed of light? We can still develop a spaceship that can travel at the speed of light! ]

[ why did professor Cara announce this news in advance? What if he was discovered and followed us to land in Europe? ]

[ what’s the use of regretting! We’re going to land in Europe soon. All the resources on Europe are our nation’s! ]

Three days later.

The day the spaceship landed in Europe.

“During the landing process, it was broadcasted live. ”

“Professor Feng and director Ma put on their spacesuits. Before they landed in Europe, Professor Feng said to Dr. Cara, “Doctor, please take care of my mother! Please bring back Suyu!” ”

Dr. Cara nodded. “Don’t worry.”

“Please!”Professor Feng bowed to professor Cara and walked into the spaceship.

The spaceship was very big.

“However, compared to an aircraft carrier, it was still a little shabby. ”

“After eight hours of flight, the spaceship finally landed on Europa. ”

“As expected, Europa was peaceful with Green Mountains and green rivers. It was a paradise for animals and plants. ”

[ Europa is so beautiful! ]

[ just like heaven! ]

[ he must be regretting it now. ]

[ didn’t YC say that Europa was dangerous? It’s a slap in the face. ]

“Professor Feng stood on the spaceship and looked at everything about Europa. He said excitedly, “Beautiful! It’s so beautiful!” ”

“Director Ma was also very excited. “Quick, put down the elevator! We need to go down and collect samples.” ”

“Soon, the pilot put down the elevator and the two of them walked down. ”

“The aerial camera hovered above the two of them, broadcasting everything to everyone. ”

“Professor Feng walked in front, and director Ma walked behind. ”

“”Director Ma, do you feel that the vegetation on Europa is thicker than on Earth?” ”

“After saying that, director Ma did not respond. ”

“Instead, the air fell into a strange silence. ”

Professor Feng took a few steps forward and felt that something was wrong. He turned around to look.

“When he saw this, his face immediately turned pale. ”
