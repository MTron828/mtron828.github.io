“Soon, Zhou Zuolong’s voice came from the other side. ”

“”Hello, yinyin.” ”

“Grandpa.”

“”Yinyin, how are you doing in Beijing? is there anyone who has wronged you?” ”

“Zheng wanyin smiled and said, “With grandma around, who would dare to bully me?” ”

“”That’s good.”Zhou zuolong continued, “Oh right, Where’s your grandma? I called her, but she hasn’t picked up.” ”

Zheng Wanyin’s heart was pounding in her throat.

“The reason she called Zhou Zuolong was to tell him about Xie wanqiu, but she couldn’t bring herself to say it. ”

She still lacked consideration for this matter.

“Although Zhou Zuolong treated her very well and was even closer to her than his biological granddaughter, she was not Zhou Zuolong’s biological granddaughter after all. ”

The two of them were not related by blood.

“Once Zhou Zuolong found out about this, he would definitely divorce Xie wanqiu. ”

“Xie wanqiu had left the Zhou family, and she was not related by blood to Zhou Zuolong. Would Zhou Zuolong still treat her as his biological granddaughter like before? ”

It was definitely impossible!

“At that time, there would only be one outcome facing her. Just like Xie wanqiu, she would be kicked out of the house. ”

The reason why her life was so comfortable was all because of Xie wanqiu.

“If it weren’t for Xie wanqiu, she wouldn’t have gotten to where she was today. ”

So...

She couldn’t betray Xie Wanqiu.

She couldn’t!

“Zheng Wanyin pinched her fingers and said in a relaxed tone, “Grandpa, you don’t have to worry. Grandma is currently resting, so you have to mute your phone. Otherwise, I’ll wake her up for you.” ”

“”Asleep? Forget it if she’s asleep!”Zhou zuolong said, “Let your grandma have a good sleep.” ”

“Okay.”

“Zhou zuolong continued, “Oh right, yinyin, how have you been in Beijing these few days? When will your grandma be discharged from the hospital?” ”

“”We’re fine. You Don’t have to worry.”Zheng wanyin continued, “Grandma’s health is fine. She just needs to be hospitalized for observation.” ”

“Okay.”

“A few minutes later, Zheng Wanyin hung up the phone. Her expression was unclear. ”

She felt that she had let Zhou zuolong down by doing this.

But there was nothing she could do.

She could not ruin her future with her own hands.

“Moreover, Xie Wanqiu was still her biological grandmother after all. Her bones were broken and her tendons were connected. ”

“If she told Zhou Zuolong about this matter, not only would Zhou Zuolong divorce Xie wanqiu, but Xie wanqiu would also definitely not forgive her! ”

“At that time, the gains would not be worth the losses. ”

“Therefore, Zhou Zuolong still could not know about this matter. ”

“Actually, it was not a big deal. ”

What if Zhou Zuolong was also secretly eating outside!

“One could not tell the heart from the face, just like how she did not expect Xie wanqiu to secretly eat outside. ”

“Born as a person, who would not want to have both fame and fortune? ”

“Zhou Zuolong must have done something wrong to Xie wanqiu first. Otherwise, Xie wanqiu would not be like this. ”

“Although Xie Wanqiu was not a particular person, there was nothing wrong with her worldview. As her granddaughter, Zheng Wanyin knew Xie wanqiu very well. ”

She believed that Xie wanqiu would not do something immoral.

“Therefore, Zhou Zuolong must have betrayed Xie Wanqiu first! ”

“If Zhou Zuolong wanted to blame someone, he should blame himself. ”

Who asked him to betray Xie wanqiu first?

This matter had nothing to do with her.

“Thinking of this, Zheng Wanyin felt much better. ”

“Zheng Wanyin looked at herself in the mirror and took a deep breath. Then, she took the oil tea fruit and walked out of the bathroom. ”

“After walking two rounds in the hospital garden, Zheng Wanyin returned to the ward. ”

The ward door had been closed.

Zheng Wanyin reached out and knocked on the door.

“In a moment, the door was opened. The person who opened the door was none other than Wu Youyu. ”

“When he saw Zheng Wanyin, Wu youyu smiled and said, “Yinyin is back.” ” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Grandpa Wu.”Zheng Wanyin’s expression was normal and there was nothing abnormal about it.

“Wu youyu continued, “Your grandmother was still talking about you just now! She said why you haven’t come back yet.” ”

“Zheng wanyin said, “There are too many people lining up!” ”

“After saying that, Zheng Wanyin walked in and said loudly, “Grandma, I bought the oil tea fruit that you like.” ”

“Zheng Wanyin did not know whether it was an illusion or a psychological reaction, but she felt that there was a strange smell in the ward. ”

It smelled very bad.

“Xie wanqiu took the oil tea fruit with both hands and said with a smile, “Thank you for your hard work, yinyin.” ”

“”Grandma, what are you saying?” ”

“Wu Youyu walked over. “WANQIU, it’s getting late. I’ll go back First!” ”

“Xie wanqiu nodded. “Brother Youyu, thank you for coming to see me today! yinyin, Send Grandpa Wu off for me.” ”

“Okay.”Zheng Wanyin nodded and sent Wu Youyu out.
