“Chapter 1156: 250: the great burning hands, walking towards the peak of the financial world! 4”

“Of course, Annie would not tell the lawyer what happened in the office, “You Mean Miss Jiang!”! Miss Jiang came to the financial group to look for Miss Zhao. Miss Zhao thought that Miss Jiang was here to reconcile with her. She did not expect that Miss Jiang was here to break up with Miss Zhao. She even said a lot of nasty things! It was fine if she said nasty things, but she still pretended to be wronged! In fact, the one who was wronged was our Miss Zhao ”

“”It’s also because Miss Zhao has a kind heart that she let her in! If it were me, I wouldn’t even bother to talk to her!” ”

“With that said, the lawyer roughly knew what was going on. ”

Jiang Xiaoyu first went to look for ye Zhuo.

“After hearing a lot of bad things from ye Zao, he then went to look for Zhao Xueyin. ”

The lawyer had previously thought that ye Zao was not the kind of person who would gossip behind others’backs.

Now it seemed that.

He had misjudged the person.

“Ye Zao not only knew how to gossip, but he was also very scheming. ”

“Otherwise, he would not have deceived Jiang Xiaoyu to such an extent. ”

“After all, Jiang Xiaoyu and Zhao Xueyin were best friends in the past! ”

“If it weren’t for ye Zao, the two of them wouldn’t have gotten to where they are today. ”

Jiang Xiaoyu was also an idiot.

She actually listened to ye Zao’s words.

“Could it be that ye Zao, a person she had only known for a few days, was inferior to Zhao Xueyin, a good friend she had known for many years? ”

“Annie paused at this point, then, she continued, “Originally, because of Miss Jiang’s matter, Miss Zhao’s mood was already very bad. In the meeting room, president ye even deliberately set Miss Zhao up! How could Miss Zhao not be angry? Haven’t you noticed? Ever since President Ye came to the consortium, everything has changed!” ”

“Hearing this, Si Lu frowned. ”

It seemed that everything had started to change after ye Zhuo returned to the Shunxi Consortium.

Even he was almost fooled by Ye Zhuo.

“Annie looked at Si Lu’s face and said, “President si, if there’s nothing else, I’ll go back first.” ”

“Go ahead.”Si lui nodded.

Annie walked forward.

Si lui looked in the direction of the meeting room with a very ugly expression.

...

On the other side.

Jiang Xiaoyu returned to the Jiang Corporation.

“When Jiang Chao saw Jiang Xiaoyu return, he said excitedly, “Xiaoyu, what did Miss Zhao Say? Did she agree to cooperate?” ”

Jiang Xiaoyu shook her head.

“Seeing this, the light on Jiang Chao’s face instantly disappeared. ”

It’s over.

It’s over now.

“Zhao Xueyin didn’t agree to cooperate, and her only hope was destroyed. ”

“”But don’t worry, Dad,”Jiang Xiaoyu continued, “Although Zhao Xueyin didn’t agree to cooperate, president ye of Shunxi Financial Group agreed to cooperate with us.” ”

President Ye?

Jiang Chao was stunned.

Who Was President Ye?

Was It Miss Ye who just came back?

“Elder Ye’s descendant?”Jiang Chao turned to look at Jiang Xiaoyu.

“Yes.”Jiang Xiaoyu nodded. “Miss Ye’s ability is extraordinary. She will definitely be able to help us get through this difficult time.”

“Jiang Chao frowned. “She just returned to the Shunxi Financial Group. She can’t even protect herself, and she still wants to help us? I’m afraid she has the heart but can’t do anything, right?” ”

The problem the Shunxi Financial Group encountered this time was not a small one.

“If Zhao Xueyin were to handle it, they might be able to tide over the difficulties. ”

Ye Zhuo...

Was not capable enough.

Was not experienced enough.

Had a shaky foundation.

“Jiang Xiaoyu said, “Dad, you have to believe me. Miss Ye is a very outstanding person! Since she promised me, she will definitely do it!” ”

“Jiang Chao asked curiously, “Xiaoyu, are you very familiar with Miss Ye?” ”

“Yes.”Jiang Xiaoyu nodded. “She is my best friend.”

“Jiang Chao said, “What about Miss Zhao? Didn’t you have the best relationship with Miss Zhao in the past? Why did you become Miss Ye Again?” ”

“”Zhao Xueyin?”Jiang Xiaoyu’s expression could not be described clearly. “In the past, I was blind to think of her as a good friend! From now on, I don’t know this person!” ”

Jiang Chao was stunned.

What was going on? Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Jiang Xiaoyu didn’t explain in detail what happened between her and Zhao Xueyin, then, she said, “Dad, just believe in Miss Ye this once! Miss Ye is Old Ye’s descendant. Didn’t you always talk about Old Ye in the past? Could it be that Old Ye’s descendant is not as good as Zhao Xueyin?” ”

The current Jiang Financial Group was isolated and helpless.

“Other than choosing to believe in Ye Zhuo, Jiang Chao had no other choice. ”

Jiang Chao sighed. “Forget it! Just believe in her this once!”

“Jiang Xiaoyu smiled and said, “I’ve made an appointment with Miss Ye to meet tomorrow at 11 am. Remember to make preparations.” ”

“En.”Jiang Chao nodded.

“At this moment, Jiang Xiaoyu’s phone rang. ”
