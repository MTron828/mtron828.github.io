“Chapter 1070: 236: great burning hands to educate Zhao Xueyin, this woman is too fierce! 1”

Translator: 549690339

Zhang Peng originally thought that the five big and three fat man walking in front of Ye Zhuo was ye Zhuo.

“Unexpectedly, the real ye Zhuo was completely concealed by the Fat Man’s body. ”

“She just walked there. The white light of the restaurant was on her body. At this time, it was floating outside. A snowflake landed mischievously on her hair. At this time, it had not melted yet, adding a bit of luxury to her national color face. ”

“Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. Such ordinary words could not describe her beauty. ” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Zhang Peng had seen many beautiful women, but this was the first time Zhang Peng had seen someone like Ye Zhuo. ”

“Zhao Xueyin pushed Zhang Peng without leaving a trace. Then, she looked at Ye Zhuo. “Ye Zhuo, you’re here.” ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. Zhang Peng also reacted at this moment. He immediately retracted his gaze and sat up straight.

“Zhao Xueyin continued, “Ye Zao, let me introduce you. This is my good friend, Zhang Peng. He just happened to be free today, so he came with me. You Don’t mind, right?” ”

“I don’t mind.”Ye Zao’s tone was indifferent.

“Zhao Xueyin smiled and looked at Zhang Peng. “Zhang Peng, this is Ye Zao. The leaves of the leaves burn brightly.” ”

“Zhang Peng immediately stretched out his hand towards ye Zao. “Hello, Miss Ye. I’m Zhang Peng.” ”

Ye Zhuo extended his hand to shake his hand.

“Zhao Xueyin’s gaze silently moved between Ye Zhuo and Zhang Peng. “Alright, let’s quickly sit down! Zhuozhuo, what do you like to eat? You order the dishes.” ”

“Thank you.”Ye Zhuo took the menu and ordered a few dishes.

Zhang Peng sat opposite ye Zhuo and appeared particularly nervous. His hands were crossed and he completely lost his usual calmness as he loitered among the flowers.

“Zhao Xueyin looked at Zhang Peng and narrowed her eyes. She smiled and said, “Ye Zao, last time I heard you say that you are a student of Beijing University.” ”

The reason she invited Zhang Peng over was because she liked Zhang Peng’s flirting skills and his looks.

She did not expect Zhang Peng to be as nervous as a quail in front of ye Zao. He did not even have the courage to raise his head to look at Ye Zao.

Trash!

Zhao Xueyin’s eyes were filled with disappointment.

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Zhao Xueyin turned to look at Zhang Peng and said with a smile, “What a coincidence! I remember that Zhang Peng also studied at a university in the capital for a period of time as an exchange student?” ”

“”Yes, yes, yes!”Zhang Peng also reacted at this time. “In that case, Miss Ye and I are schoolmates! What year is Miss Ye in this year?” ”

“Sophomore year.”Ye Zao’s tone was indifferent.

“”OH.”Facing ye Zao, the usually eloquent Zhang Peng actually couldn’t say a single dirty word. ”

“Actually, this wasn’t Zhang Peng’s fault at all. It was only ye Zao’s aura that was too strong. ”

Zhao Xueyin creased her brows without leaving a trace.

“In a short while, the dishes were served. ”

Zhao Xueyin and Zhang Peng were like chewing wax. Only ye Zao was eating very happily.

“In her life, only food and time could not be let down. ”

“Zhao Xueyin stood up and said, “Ye Zhuo, you eat first. I’m going to the washroom.” ”

“Go ahead.”Ye Zhuo’s voice was shallow.

“Knowing that Zhao Xueyin had something to say to him, Zhang Peng stood up as well. “Miss Ye, I’m going to the washroom too.” ”

“Okay.”

“Sure enough, just as Zhang Peng walked to the door of the washroom, he saw Zhao Xueyin standing there waiting for him. ”

“Sister Xueyin.”

“Zhao Xueyin’s expression was a little ugly. “Little Zhang, what’s wrong with you? I see that you’re usually quite smart. Why are you always dropping the ball today?” ”

“Zhang Peng scratched his head. “Sister Xueyin, that Ye Zhuo’s aura is too strong. I Can’t hold it in at all!”Not only could he not hold it in, Zhang Pengyu was also a little afraid. When he saw ye Zhuo’s eyes, he could not help but feel inferior... ”

“Zhao Xueyin said, “Isn’t she just a little girl? What can’t you hold it in?” ”

Zhang Peng Sighed.

“Zhao Xueyin looked at Zhang Peng and continued, “Do you know ye Langhua?” ”

“Zhang Peng first shook his head, then quickly nodded. “I know!” ”

“Zhao Xueyin said, “Ye Zhuo is ye Langhua’s granddaughter!” ”

“When he heard this, Zhang Peng looked at Zhao Xueyin in surprise. ”

“Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes. “Xi Muwen is just a poor kid from the countryside. He can even handle the daughter of a rich family, ye Langhua. Are you afraid that you won’t be able to handle Ye Zhuo?”Zhao Xueyin paused, then, she continued, “I was kind enough to introduce ye Zhuo to you. If you think that you can’t handle her, then I’ll have to find someone else!” ”

“Back then, Xi Muwen was still no match for the current Zhang Peng! ”
