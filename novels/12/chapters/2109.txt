“After a long time, the sky outside the window had gradually darkened, and he did not know that he was tired. ”

Until the sound of a phone rang in the air.

Cen Shaoqing unhurriedly removed the trap and walked over to answer the phone.

The phone call was from ye Zhuo.

Ye Zhuo told him that he could set off to S Galaxy Tomorrow afternoon.

“After hanging up the phone, Cen Shaoqing did not continue to practice boxing. Instead, he went to take a shower. ”

“When he arrived downstairs, Zhou Xiang had already returned. ”

“Cen Yueying’s youngest son, Tong Tong, followed Zhou Xiang back. ”

“Uncle!”

Cen Shaoqing walked over and patted Tong Tong’s head. “Why are you here?”

“Tong tong smiled and said, “I miss grandma and Great-grandma!” ”

“Old Madam Cen chuckled and said, “Come, come, come. Let Great-grandma take a look!” ”

Tong Tong skipped over. “Great-grandma!”

“Old Madam Cen continued, “You’ve grown a lot taller! Where’s Your Mother? Why didn’t the Third Girl Come With You?” ”

“The third girl went on a business trip! So I came with Grandma!”

“Old Madam Cen smiled and said, “If you dare call your mother the third girl, be careful that she’ll beat you up!” ”

Tong Tong immediately covered his mouth with his hand.

“Old Mrs. Cen looked at CEN Shaoqing and said, “Look at how Cute Tong Tong is. When can you give birth to a great-grandson for me to play with?” ”

“CEN Shaoqing said, “Zhongruo is still young.” ”

“”At least you are sensible.”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Although I hope to have a great-grandson, zhongruo is still young. You must not bully her. If I find out that you are bullying her, be careful of your lackeys!” ”Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“”Don’t worry, I know what to do.”Cen Shaoqing’s tone was low. ”

“It’d better be like that.”Old Mrs. Cen snorted.

“Zhou xiang smiled and said, “Mom, don’t worry. Shaoqing is the same as his father. He will never do anything out of the ordinary when it comes to dating.” ”

“”Who knows if he has inherited Haifeng’s excellent genes,”old Mrs. Cen said. ”

“Hearing these words, Cen Shaoqing felt a little upset. ”

Zhou Xiang and old Mrs. Cen both trusted Cen Haifeng very much.

“If they knew that Cen Haifeng had actually done such a thing, how would they collapse? ”

Especially Old Mrs. Cen.

“What she faced was not only the problem of her son, but also the betrayal of the Cen family’s old master. ”

“The old man was already so old, how could she bear these things? ”

“”Shaoqing, what are you thinking about?”Zhou Xiang patted Cen Shaoqing’s arm. ”

“Cen Shaoqing smiled slightly, “It’s nothing. By the way, Mom, Grandma, I’m going on a long trip with Zao Zao Tomorrow afternoon. “I might need some time to come back. I might not be able to keep in touch with you during this period of time. You guys stay at home and take good care of yourselves.” ”

“Where can we not keep in touch?”Old Mrs. Cen asked curiously.

“CEN Shaoqing said, “It’s a very confidential experiment.” ”

“Is it on Mars?”Zhou Xiang asked.

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Zhou xiang continued, “Don’t worry. We will take good care of ourselves at home. But you, you must take good care of Luoluo.” ”

“”Your mother is right.”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Luoluo is a girl after all. When she goes out, she must protect Luoluo!” ”

“I know.”

“”Then when will you come back?”Zhou xiang asked, “Will the experiment end on that day?” ”

“”I’m not too sure about the exact time. It may take one to three months,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“That long?”Old Mrs. Cen frowned.

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “This experiment is more important.”

“”I still say the same thing. Take good care of my granddaughter-in-law. If I come back and find that Ye Zi is missing a single hair, I will hold you responsible!” ”

“”Don’t worry,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“After repeatedly explaining a lot, old Mrs. Cen finally felt at ease. ”

The next afternoon.

Ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing set off for the s galaxy.

Ye Shu prepared a lot of things for ye Zhuo to bring along.

“It was almost a day and a half’s journey. With these food and Cen Shaoqing around, Ye Zhuo was not bored. ”

A Day and a half quickly arrived.

Ye Han had been waiting at the interstellar shuttle’s landing spot for a long time.

“As soon as the interstellar shuttle arrived, he walked forward. “Sister! Mr. Cen!” ”

“Although he had always called Cen Shaoqing brother-in-law in front of ye Zhuo, in front of Cen Shaoqing, he had always called him Mr. Cen. ”

He could not let Cen Shaoqing see that he had already acknowledged him as his brother-in-law.

“As a man, no one understood men better than him. ”

Those that were too easy to obtain were basically not cherished.

“If he acknowledged Cen Shaoqing so easily, what if Cen Shaoqing did not cherish ye Zao in the future? ”

“Ye Zao walked down from the shuttle. “Ye Han, Mom brought a lot of things for you. They’re inside. Go get them yourself.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Han nodded and went in to get the things.

Ye Zhuo brought Cen Shaoqing to her previous residence and briefly introduced her to him.

“Not long after, Ye Han also walked in and took out a document to pass to Cen Shaoqing. “Mr. Cen, this is the Cen family’s information in the main alliance. Oh right, you have a fiancée in the main alliance.” ”
