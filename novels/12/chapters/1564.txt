Translator: 549690339

“It was just a rumor that she was kept by Wu Youyu, but it was true that she was raped by Lin Ze and was pregnant with Lin Ze’s child! ”

It was already very obvious that public opinion would be on that side!

“Therefore, Zhang Qingqing was not afraid at all. ”

“Lin Ze was in a dilemma this time. No matter what, he had to marry her! ”

“Mother Zhang nodded with a smile, “I think Qingqing is right. Old Zhang, just listen to Qingqing! “If Qingqing marries into the Lin family, then we will become in-laws of the Lin Family! “When the time comes, the Lin family’s property will be Qingqing’s, and if it’s Qingqing’s, Won’t It Be Ours?” ”

Father Zhang hesitated for a moment before turning to look at Zhang Qingqing. “Are you sure this is okay?”

“Zhang Qingqing nodded seriously. “Dad, just listen to me!” ”

“Okay!”

“Life was a gamble. If they won, it would be a huge fortune. To them, this deal was not a loss at all! ”

“Soon, Liu Pan arrived. ”

“That night, a newspaper reported an exclusive. In less than an hour, the news had 20 million views and more than 50,000 comments! ”

“At the same time, there were three hot searches on Weibo. ”

Each of them had the logo of ‘explosive’.

# the Crown Prince of the Lin family is suspected of rape #

# the LIN Group #

# the Crown Prince of the Lin family raped and caused the woman to get pregnant #

The comments section was very hostile.

[ rich people can really do whatever they want! My heart aches for this girl. ]

[ I didn’t expect this kind of thing to happen in 2002! ]

“”Everyone, stand up. Don’t bow down to the evil forces and seek justice for Miss Xiao Zhang!” ”

“Oh my God! I originally thought that the LIN Group was the most humane company in the country. I didn’t expect the future successor to be like this!”

“”This Lin Group’s crown prince is too much of a fraud. If it was my son, he would have broken his leg long ago.” ”

[ we must all unite and boycott the LIN Group together. ]

Zhang Qingqing browsed through the comments of the netizens one by one. The corners of her mouth were filled with a proud smile.

The reactions of the netizens were even more intense than she had imagined.

Good.

This was really great.

“Zhang Qingqing narrowed her eyes, took out her phone, and changed her Weibo name to [ victim Xiao Zhang ] . Then, she posted a Weibo post. ”

“Victim Xiao Zhang: [ hello everyone, I am the victim Xiao Zhang. ]. On November 23,2002, my friend booked a floor at the Chao Feng Club to celebrate my birthday. That night, seven or eight people came, and among them, young master Lin of the Lin Group, Lin Ze, was one of them... ”

“After this happened, I was very scared. I didn’t know how to face myself, and I didn’t know how to face my parents. So, I could only pretend that nothing had happened. Before dawn, I left the club. Time passed day by day. Every day, I tried to convince myself to forget this matter. Because I knew that I was just an ordinary family’s daughter. I couldn’t get justice for myself! Time passed quickly. Just as I was about to forget that unbearable night, a report broke the silence. That day, I wasn’t feeling well, so I went to the hospital for a check-up. Unexpectedly, the result was that I was pregnant! ”

“At that moment, I felt like my sky was about to collapse! How could I be pregnant with his child! ! I thought about having an abortion, but the Doctor said that my constitution was special and wasn’t suitable for an abortion. If I aborted this child, I would never have the chance to have a child again! ”

“I had no choice but to keep this child. I could only thicken my skin and look for Lin Ze, but who knew... ! ... Lin Ze actually refused to acknowledge this child. He suspected that the child wasn’t his. Actually, I knew that he didn’t doubt the child’s origin, but he felt that I wasn’t worthy of him! Yes, I admit that my family background was ordinary. I wasn’t worthy of him at all. ! But back then, if he hadn’t drugged me, I wouldn’t have been pregnant with his child! ... Now, I didn’t want to pursue his responsibility. I just wanted him to bear the responsibility of a father! [ picture jpg ][ picture jpg ][ picture jpg ] ”

“At the back of the essay, there were five pictures. The first was Zhang Qingqing’s pregnancy report, the second was the blood on the white sheets, and the third was the picture of Lin Ze lying on the bed. ”

“Zhang Qingqing pushed all the questions onto Lin Ze, and even reversed black and white, accusing Lin ze of drugging her. ”

“Soon, this little essay became a hot search topic. ”

“Zhang Qingqing’s fan count went directly from two digits to three digits, four digits, and finally five digits and six digits. ”Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))
