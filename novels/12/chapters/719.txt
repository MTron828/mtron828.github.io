“Chapter 720: 160: This is my younger sister, Ye Zhuo! 3”

Translator: 549690339

“Song Chenyu Thought for a moment, then, he said, “I feel that Lu Xiu seems to like Miss Ye. I grew up with Lu Xiu since young, so I know Lu Xiu quite well. I know that he’s a bit of a loner. Other than doing scientific research, he rarely interacts with others. However, he treats miss ye very differently. Not only did he take the initiative to call Miss Ye Daddy, did you notice the look in his eyes? “When he saw Miss Ye, his eyes lit up! It was as if he saw the whole world! “To be honest, I’ve never seen Lu Xiu like that before!””

“Hearing this, Cen Yuyan’s brows immediately furrowed tightly. The scene she saw at He Ziteng’s house immediately appeared in front of her eyes.”

“At that time, Lu Xiu’s expression when he looked at ye Zao was indeed very abnormal.”

Ye Zhuo was too shameless!

“He clearly had Cen Shaoqing, yet he still had delusions of wanting to interfere between her and Lu Xiu!”

“When she said this, song Chenyu patted Cen Yuyan’s hand, she comforted her, “Actually, I was just guessing blindly. Whether or not I really like her, I’m not too sure either. Yuyan, don’t take it to heart. I didn’t mean anything by what I said. I just wanted you to have some idea.””

“Cen Yuyan said angrily, “If ye Zao dares to seduce Lu Xiu, I’m not done with her!””

“Song Chenyu quickly reminded Cen Yuyan to pay attention to her volume. “Yuyan, I already said that I was just guessing. Did you really take it seriously? I believe that Miss Ye wouldn’t do such a thing!””

“Zhou Xiaowan fanned the flames by the side, “A pretty little girl like ye Zao likes to attract bees and butterflies outside to prove her charm! She’s proud of it! She’s already fifth master Cen’s girlfriend, yet she’s still so restless!””

“Song Chenyu said, “You can’t say that. I don’t think Miss Ye did anything. If you want to say that you like her, it’s Lu Xiu who fell in love with Miss Ye first.””

“Song Chenyu’s words seemed to be an excuse for ye Zao, but in fact, it was a disguised form of smearing ye Zao’s reputation.”

“The more Cen Yuyan heard, the angrier she got. She wanted to immediately go and argue with ye Zao.” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

What was so great about being pretty?

“Just because she was pretty, she could hook up with other people and attract other women?”

“Song Chenyu reached out and patted Cen Yuyan’s back, “Alright Yuyan, don’t be angry. I’m just guessing. It’s easy to get wrinkles if you’re angry. It’s not worth it to get wrinkles for such a small matter! “Besides, we still have to go to the nursing home with Lu Xiu tomorrow! “It won’t look good if you get wrinkles!””

The anger in Cen Yuyan’s heart dissipated a little.

Old Madam Cen glanced over several times.

“Her instincts told her that song Chenyu, Cen Yuyan, and Zhou Xiaowan were whispering together. Nothing good was going to happen.”

“Old Madam Cen looked at Cen Yuying, Cen Yueya, and Cen Yueying, “Big Girl, second girl, and third girl, let me tell you, you are not allowed to imitate that idiot fourth girl! Yezi had almost slapped song Chenyu’s face until it was swollen, but this idiot was still holding the ugly fish’s smelly feet! I really don’t know what she’s thinking!””

Thinking about eating farts?

“Cen Yuying was a little confused. She did not know what song Chenyu was thinking. “Grandma, what do you mean by that?””

“Old Mrs. Cen said, “What do you mean? That ugly fish wants to squeeze into Yezi’s position! She doesn’t even look at herself in the mirror to see how much she weighs!””

“Cen Yueya smiled and said, “Grandma, don’t worry. Look at Shaoqing’s strict wife. Do you think song Chenyu has any hope of stealing someone else’s position? Moreover, do you think that song Chenyu is half as good-looking as searing? It’s just a clown. You Don’t have to care at all!””

Cen Shaoqing had changed so much because of ye searing.

From the principle of never getting married to the law of truth.

From the principle of vegetarianism to the principle of no restrictions on meat and vegetables.

“Other than ye Zao, no one could break Cen Shaoqing’s taboos.”

“To Cen Shaoqing, Ye Zao was a unique existence.”

“CEN yueying nodded. “I think what second sister said makes sense. Grandma, Song Chenyu is just a clown. You Don’t have to take him seriously.””

“Old Madam Cen felt that what the two sisters said made sense, so she nodded as well.”

“However, she didn’t understand why the eldest, second, and third were so smart while Cen Yuyan was so stupid?”

Could it be that Cen Yuyan’s genes had mutated?

Old Madam Cen frowned.

...

“At 3:30 pm, Cen Shaoqing sent ye Zhuo back.”

“After a day of snow, it was a vast expanse of whiteness outside. The traffic on the road was also relatively slow.”

“Cen Shaoqing turned up the temperature of the air-conditioning. “Leader, when are you preparing to return to Yunjing?””
