“Man Wen didn’t say anything. He stood up and saw the card on man Xing’s desk. He picked it up and asked, “What’s the password?” ”

“It’s my birthday.”Man Xing pressed his temples.

Man Wen put the card into his pocket with satisfaction. “Let’s go.”

“Looking at man Wen’s back, man Xing sighed helplessly. ”

“On the other side, Zhao Dan contacted man Xing as soon as man Wen left. ”

“Xing ‘er.”

“Man Xing looked at his mother in the video and said with a smile, “Mom, have you seen elder sister?” ”

“Hearing this, Zhao Dan was stunned. “Xing ‘er, you know?” ”

“Man Xing nodded. “This is a good thing. After 19 years, I thought I would never see elder sister again.” ”

“Looking at the sensible man Xing and thinking about the wall that he had met with Ye Zhuo today, Zhao Dan’s face darkened a little, he continued, “Your eldest sister wasn’t raised by my side after all. She might not be as intimate as you think. Don’t have too much hope for her.” ”

“MAN XING smiled and said, “Blood is thicker than water. No matter what eldest sister is like now, I believe that one day, eldest sister will understand you and father.” ”

“”En.”Zhao dan nodded and continued, “Oh right, did Wen er come to you to ask for money? If he comes to you to ask for money, you must not give it to him! That child is getting more and more insensible!” ”

“...”man Xing’s expression was a little ugly. “That man Wen has already taken my card.”

“This child!”Zhao Dan sighed.

“Among her son and daughter, she was most satisfied with man Xing. Other than ye Zhuo, she was most dissatisfied with man Wen. ”

“Man Wen was just a boy, but he did not have any sense of responsibility. He did not do his proper job all day and could not even compare to half of man Xing. ”

“Seeing his mother like this.., mAN XING smiled and said, “Mom, you don’t have to worry. Man Wen is still a child. When he’s older and has a family, he’ll know how hard you’ve worked! “He’s not a bad person by nature. It’s just that he’s too young now and doesn’t see much of him. He’s a little immature in all aspects. Isn’t there a saying, ‘only when you raise a child will you know how kind your parents are’?” ”

“Seeing man Xing like this, Zhao Dan sighed in her heart. ” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Indeed, there were nine sons born from dragons, each with their own differences. ”

“They were both children born from her womb, yet man Xing was so sensible. As for man Wen and Ye Zhuo, they were simply... ”

“Man Wen was still alright. At the very least, he was still quite respectful to his mother, but what about Ye Zhuo? ”

He had no respect for his elders!

“Thinking about the experience in the afternoon, Zhao Dan was still a little angry. ”

What the hell!

He really didn’t put her in his eyes at all.

“MAN XING smiled and said, “Mom, you and dad are both so outstanding. It’s said that a tiger father does not have a dog son. Please believe me. Man Wen is just a little immature for the time being. In time, he will definitely shine in everyone’s eyes.” ”

Man Wen did not study hard in school either. He had not even graduated from high school before he was expelled by his teacher. These words were just used to comfort Zhao Dan.

How could such a person have any great prospects?

“However, Zhao Dan did not think so. ”

“Man Xing was a very outstanding person in her eyes. He had a very good eye. Since man Xing had said so, then man Wen would definitely not be too bad. After all, they were siblings of the same mother. ”

Just like Ye Zhuo.

“Although ye Zhuo did not have much upbringing, the genes in her bones were still there. Even though she had been wandering since she was young, she was still very outstanding. Otherwise, how could a girl become the ruler of Changyue? ”

It was simply impossible!

Zhao Dan smiled and nodded. “Yes.”

“After saying that.., zhao dan continued, “Xing ‘er, although you are Wen ‘er’s elder sister, you are not much older than him. In the future, you don’t have to spoil him, nor do you have to secretly give him money to spend! “He is a boy. How can you ask for money from your family all day long! “If we can support him for a while, can we support him for a Lifetime?” ”

“Other families were all mothers who spoiled their sons. When it came to their families, they had become older sisters who spoiled their younger brothers. ”

Man Xing really doted on Man Wen.

She would practically give him whatever he asked for.

“When he was young, if man Wen failed his exams or was reprimanded at school, Man Xing would help him out. In addition, man Xing was sensible and obedient, and her grades were good. The teachers were willing to give her face. ”

Manxing nodded. “I know.”

“Zhao dan continued, “Then that’s all for now. Xing ‘er, mom isn’t by your side. Take good care of yourself.” ”

“”Yes, Mom, take good care of yourself too. Bring elder sister home early.” ”

“Okay.”

“Although Zhao Dan did not like Ye Zhuo, Ye Zhuo was her child after all. Even if she did not think for Zhao Dan, she had to think for Manxing. To become a manxing, she had to borrow ye Zhuo’s power. ”
