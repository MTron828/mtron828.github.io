Chapter 109: 077: setting people up, Birthday Banquet Scene 2

After all, that was the high and Mighty Cen Fifth Master.

Now it seemed that his daughter was simply a fairy of the nine heavens that was even more noble than a Phoenix!

CEN fifth master would sooner or later bow down to his daughter’s skirt.

At that time, he would be CEN fifth master’s father-in-law.

The entire CEN group would have to give half to their family!

After Mu Yourong gave birth to the child and stabilized her position, the entire Cen family would belong to the Mu family!

The more he thought about it, the more excited he became.

Shen Rong walked over with a cup of tea in her hand. “What are you two talking about? Why are you chatting so happily? Come, have a sip of tea.”

Mu Yourong took a sip of tea.

Soldier Mu told Shen Rong about what had happened.

When Shen Rong heard that Mu Yourong was actually the savior that old master Yang was looking for, her reaction was even more excited than soldier Mu’s.

She had only heard about old master Yang from the circle of ladies today.

She did not expect that the main character of this matter was her daughter!

If this was found out by those aristocratic ladies, they would die of envy!

In the future, she would be a c-list position in the circle of aristocratic ladies.

Those aristocratic ladies who looked down on her now would have to come over and beg her in the future.

The corners of Shen Rong’s mouth were almost at the edge of her ears. She knew that her daughter was not something to be trifled with.

Sooner or later, she would soar to ninety thousand Li!

“Fortunately, we broke off the engagement with the Cen family. How could that rundown family of the Cen family be worthy of my daughter!”Shen Rong continued, “Oh right, Old Mu, is the Cen family still in the cloud capital? We can’t let them see yourong. What if they know that yourong is now Old Master Yang’s Savior and refuse to leave our family?”

With a rundown family like the Cen family, what shameless things could they not do?

Shen Rong felt disgusted whenever she thought of the appearance of that old woman from the Cen family and Zhou Xiang’s marriage proposal.

How many years ago was the engagement!

They actually still had the face to take it seriously.

“They are penniless now. Even if they want to leave, they can’t,”Mu Yourong continued. “The last time I saw that old woman from the Cen family, she even began to beg on the streets!”

“Really?”Shen Rong asked in surprise.

She recalled how glorious the Cen family had been in the cloud capital back then!

She had not expected that they would also have this day!

While she was surprised, a gleeful glint flickered in Shen Rong’s eyes.

Back then, they had looked up to the Cen family and had to look at the Cen family’s face in every matter. They had even spared no expense in using their unborn daughter to curry favor with the CEN family. Now, the tables had finally turned!

Mu Yourong nodded. “I saw it with my own eyes. How could it be fake?”

If the Cen family had not fallen, how could old lady cen have dressed like that?

Mu Yourong recalled that night in front of the barbecue stall, Old Lady Cen’s shabby clothes.

It was simply pitiful!

Soldier Mu narrowed his eyes. “In short, yourong, you should stay as far away from them as possible. The Cen family is no longer on the same side as us.”

“You don’t need to say this. I know,”Mu Yourong said.

Since she had lived a new life, she naturally had to wear the heaviest crown and marry the noblest man.

Otherwise, what was the point of her living a new life?

Therefore, Mu Yourong would do the same as in her previous life. Once she returned, she would break off the engagement with the Cen family.

In her previous life, her mistake was that she should not have married that person and ruined her life.

Not in this life!

Wasn’t ye Zao becoming more and more dazzling?

Then let ye Zao marry him!

She wanted the her in her previous life to become the ye Zao in this life!

Thinking of this, a bright light flashed in Mu Yourong’s eyes. She continued, “Right, father and mother, I want to discuss something with you.”

“Speak.”Soldier Mu turned his head.

Mu yourong continued, “In a while, I’m going to send a new year present to the Ye family. I hope mother can accompany me.”

“What? Send a new year present to the Ye Family?”Shen Rong widened her eyes in shock, her eyes filled with disbelief. “Yourong, you mean the Ye Shu Family?”

“Yes.”Mu Yourong nodded very calmly.

Shen Rong said speechlessly, “Yourong, you must have a fever!”

It was one thing for Ye Shu, that shameless slut, to have swapped her daughter, but she had even tortured mu yourong for so many years!

Mu Yourong was still thinking of giving her a new year present!

She was really crazy!

“I don’t have a fever, Mom. I’m very clear-headed now.” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Why?”Shen Rong continued, “It’s not that you don’t know how ye Shu has treated you all these years. Even if I killed her with a knife, I wouldn’t feel relieved. You actually want to give her a new year present!”

Mu Yourong did not directly answer Shen Rong’s question. She continued, “Mom, do you know about the song family?”
