“Chapter 666: 152: the truth has been dug out layer by layer. The secret of the health-preserving soup, Old Lady Lin was filled with regret! 4”

Translator: 549690339

“Old Lady Lin held the appraisal report in her hands, her eyes unable to reveal any expression.”

“If what ye Zao said was true, then what kind of person had she raised by her side all these years?”

But Feng Qianhua’s consistent delivery of health-preserving soup to her for more than ten years was not fake either.

“If Feng Qianhua was really that vicious, would she still give her the health soup?”

“At this moment, ye Zao’s voice sounded again. “Actually, Feng Qianhua did more than that. Grandma, do you still remember the health soup that you drink every afternoon?””

Health Soup?

Old Lady Lin suddenly raised her head to look at Ye Zao.

Could there be a problem with the health soup?

“At this moment, Feng Qianhua was completely flustered. “B * Tch! Shut Up! Shut up for me!”She had never expected that ye Zao would even know about the matter of the nourishing soup!”

Little B * Tch!

How did this little B * Tch do it?

What should she do now?

“TSK.”Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly. “You’re angry from embarrassment?”

“Aunt Zhang looked at ye Zao, her eyes emitting a cold and sinister light.”

She couldn’t let ye Zao say these things out loud.

She couldn’t!

“If these things were exposed, then Feng Qianhua would be finished.”

“No matter what, she had to protect Feng Qianhua and her daughter.”

She couldn’t let Feng Qianhua and her daughter be threatened.

“Aunt Zhang clenched her hands into fists, grabbed a vase on the table, and ran in the direction of Ye Zao. From the way she looked, it was obvious that she wanted to perish together with him.”

She was almost 60 years old.

Ye Zao was only 19 years old this year.

“On the road to the Netherworld, she would not lose out if she could take ye Zao with her.”

As long as ye Zao left.

All of this could be confirmed with death!

“All of this happened too quickly, and almost no one could react in time.”

Just as ye Zao was about to counterattack.

“A figure rushed over quickly, blocked in front of ye Zao, and raised his leg to kick aunt Zhang.”

Bang —

Aunt Zhang smashed the vase onto the ground because of the penetration force.

The fragments scattered all over the ground.

“By the time everyone reacted, Aunt Zhang had already been stepped on by Lin Ze.”

Ye Zao was a little surprised.

She did not expect that this brother’s skills were so good.

“Are you okay?”Lin Ze looked at ye Zao.

“I’m fine.”Ye Zao shook his head slightly.

Lin Jincheng reacted at this moment and immediately called for the security guards to restrain Aunt Zhang.

Aunt Zhang did not expect Lin Ze to suddenly appear.

She originally wanted to perish together with ye Zao!

“Although she was already controlled by the security guards, she was still unwilling to give up and struggled desperately, “Let go of me! All of you, let go of me! Old Madam, you must not believe the nonsense of this little slut! Miss Qianhua is a very filial and good child!””

Lin Jincheng instructed the bodyguards to gag Aunt Zhang.

“After the gag, the air instantly returned to silence.”

Old Madam Lin stood up and looked at Ye Zhuo. “What’s wrong with the health soup? Go On!”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “You’ll have to ask Feng Qianhua about this. You’ve always treated her like your own daughter. Ask her what she put in your health soup? “Why do you rely on the health-preserving soup every day? If You Don’t drink it, you’ll cough non-stop and even cough up blood!””

“Qianhua?”Old Lady Lin turned to look at Feng Qianhua with a terrifyingly cold gaze.

Ye Zhuo’s words made her think of many things.

“Over the years, her body had been deteriorating day by day. Every day when it reached eleven o’clock, she would subconsciously think of Feng Qianhua’s health-preserving soup.”

“Moreover, that kind of desire was emitted from her bones.”

“As long as she did not drink it for a day, the bones in her body would be as if there were tens of millions of ants gnawing on them.”

“In the past, Old Madam Lin had never felt that there was anything wrong with these heads.”

“But now that she thought about it, it was simply terrifying!”

This was clearly the state when her drug addiction kicked in.

Could it be.

There was something wrong with this health-preserving soup?

Old Lady Lin’s gaze changed again and again.

Feng Qianhua shook her head with reddened eyes. “Aunt Lin! I didn’t! I didn’t put anything in! Please believe me! I really didn’t!”

She had always been very cautious about these things.

How did ye Zao Find Out?

What exactly was going on?

It didn’t matter.

“Even if ye Zao found out, it didn’t matter.”

“To be on the safe side, for so many years, she had personally brewed medicine for Old Lady Lin and never put her hands on others.”

Even the dregs of the medicine were sent far away. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Ye Zao would definitely not be able to obtain any evidence.

She could not panic.

The current her could not panic.

Feng Qianhua tried her best to calm herself down.

“Ye Zao then took out another set of test results, “These things are not things that you can deny just because you want to! This is the test results of the health preserving soup. According to the test results, there are a total of 23 medicinal ingredients in the health preserving soup. Three of them are addictive poisons. If you take them for a long time, not only will you become dependent on them, but it will also cause damage to your body. Grandma, you have been drinking it for more than ten years. Your body’s organs must be starting to fail by now.””
