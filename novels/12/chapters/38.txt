Chapter 39: It Was Amazing!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In Li Qingyue’s perception, Mu Yourong was an all-powerful person who could do anything. In fact, it was Mu Yourong who provided her with the information regarding the Annox Parasite.

Before encountering Mu Yourong, Li Qingyue was using a very common slow poison on Yi Tao. It was a stealthy poison that could not be traced from clinical testing. However, if this incident were exposed, she would be doomed!

Nonetheless, the Annox parasite was different because it was a parasite, after all. Moreover, Yi Tao had a history of traveling abroad, so no one would be able to figure out that someone intentionally caused Yi Tao’s illness.

Therefore, given the information she received from Mu Yourong, Li Qingyue felt relieved that Ye Zhuo’s prescription was utterly useless. “Yourong, I can now be at ease with your confirmation.”

Mu Yourong smiled faintly and raised her cup to Qingyue. “May our friendship last.”

“To long-lasting friendship.” Li Qingyue raised her cup as well. “Yourong, I must say that I think that fake sister of yours is really different from the past…. Should you keep an eye on her?”

Mu Yourong smirked. “She’s just a deadbeat who can’t do anything, never mind her.” Mu Yourong was a little threatened by Ye Zhuo in the beginning, but she paid no attention to Ye Zhuo anymore now.

She had been reborn, so she was well aware of many advantageous opportunities; furthermore, she had the system and Goldfinger with her now, in addition to being the daughter of a wealthy family.

What did Ye Zho have? Not only did Ye Zhuo have nothing, on the contrary, she was the bastard child of a mistress that everyone despised.

…

Ye Zhuo was rather busy recently.

She was busy renovating the shop on one hand while she was working on completing the OS system on the other. To compound to her work, she still had to find time to guide Ye Shu on her cooking skills.

The main cuisine served in the restaurant was ‘rabbit’ hotpot. Even though rabbits were really cute, rabbit meat was truly delicious too.

The main job when it came to preparing the hotpot was to stir-fry the hotpot base. Ye Shu began fumbling her way step by step according to the recipe given by Ye Zhuo. Nonetheless, it did not take long before an enticing fragrance wafted out of the kitchen.

Ye Sen returned home after delivering parcels. He could feel that he was almost drooling upon smelling the fragrance from the kitchen. “Sis, what are we having for dinner tonight?”

“We’re having rabbit hotpot.” Ye Shu’s voice was heard coming from the kitchen. “Take a shower first, and dinner will be ready when you’re done.”

“Alright.”

Ye Shu had already served the hotpot on the table when Ye Sen came out of the shower. A layer of chili oil floated on the surface of the boiling soup while a ring of blanched vegetables, meatballs, duck blood, bacon, and beef slices surrounded the side of the hotpot… One would drool from hunger just at the sight of it.

“Whoa! It smells amazing! My sis is awesome!” Ye Sen gave Ye Shu a thumbs up. “Sis, with your cooking skills, we will certainly be able to make a good profit from the opening day!”

Ye Shu smiled and said, “Stop being verbose, tell Zhuo Zhuo to come for dinner, quick. I’m going to make a hotpot dipping sauce.”

“Alright.” Ye Sen nodded and came to the door of Ye Zhuo’s room. He shouted aloud, “I’m coming in, my niece.”

“Come in; the door is not locked.”

As soon as Ye Sen opened the door, he saw Ye Zhuo seated in front of her laptop with her hands typing away on the keyboard swiftly. Her fair, jade-like fingertips formed a sharp contrast with the black keyboard.

One of her hands was clutching the mouse while she cradled a phone between her head and her shoulder as if she was on a call with someone. “If the silver one is not available, use the white then. It doesn’t matter which brand it is, but it has to support environmental protection! The formaldehyde must not exceed the prescribed limits….”

The warm light cast a layer of faint glow on her face while the calmness and quietness of life looked great on her. Ye Sen was dumbstruck in bewilderment.

He had never known that a person could operate a laptop so swiftly while talking on the phone… Could it be that this was how a legend did two things at once? It was amazing!

Ye Zhuo’s hands were moving faster and faster, just like the speed of his hands when he was playing a game.

Furthermore, the laptop screen was displaying symbols that Ye Sen could not read.

It looked just like an alien language that was constantly transforming such that the sight of it made Ye Sen dizzy.

In an instant, Ye Zhuo hung up the call and shifted her gaze to look toward Ye Sen. “Are you looking for me, uncle?”

Ye Sen recovered from his temporary daze in surprise. “Oh, dinner’s ready.”

“Uncle, you can start with my mom first. Don’t need to wait for me.” Ye Zhuo continued to use her hands. “I will join when I’m done with this and have saved it.”

Ye Sen knew that Ye Zhuo was doing something important, so he did not disturb her anymore. He said, “Do finish up quickly so that you can have dinner. We are having hotpot tonight.”

“Alright.” Ye Zhuo nodded.

About 15 minutes later, Ye Zhuo completed the final code, clicked save, and checked to make sure that there was no other issue. Then, she came to the living room for dinner.

At that time, Ye Sen was seated on the sofa playing games in the living room. On the other hand, Ye Shu was studying a book on owning a shop and managing it.

She did not have much experience in owning a shop, but she had a rather intelligent brain, so she could count on studying to gather more experience to avoid any detours.

“Mom, uncle, have you both eaten?” Ye Zhuo asked in astonishment.

Ye Sen was busy playing games, so Ye Shu responded at once as she closed the book. “We haven’t eaten yet; we’re waiting for you.”

“Mom, there’s no need to wait for me during meals next time. You’ll just need to leave some for me,” said Ye Zhuo.

“The meal tastes better with more people.” Ye Shu turned on the induction cooker, and the fiery red soup immediately started to boil again. “Zhuo Zhuo, go and bring over the Coke in the fridge.”

Upon saying that, she raised her head and turned toward Ye Sen. “Ye Sen! Stop playing games! Come and eat now, quick!”

“Coming, coming!” Ye Sen walked to the dining table with his phone clutched in his hand and took a seat.

Meanwhile, Ye Zhuo came with the Coke. She noticed that Ye Sen was fully absorbed in the game, so she could not refrain herself from asking, “Uncle, what is that game you are playing?”

“King of Glory.”

“King of Glory? Is it fun?” Ye Zhuo asked.

“It’s really fun!” Ye Sen held the phone with both his hands with an excited expression on his face. “Stop running if you dare! Why are you running? F*ck! F*ck! Someone is hiding in the bushes! Come and save me, quick! Monkey, come and save me, quick! This monkey must be an elementary school student, right? Do you even know how to play? Stupid monkey!”

“How do you know that your teammate is an elementary school student?” Ye Zhuo asked out of curiosity.

Ye Sen replied, “His skill is so amateur... I can tell that he is an elementary school student just from my intuition.”

A person with amateur skills must be an elementary school student?

Ye Zhuo blanched her favorite minced shrimp in the hotpot and thought to herself how it was unfortunate that elementary school students had to bear the blame. Nonetheless, it did not take long before the minced shrimp was cooked.

Ye Zhuo scooped out a piece of minced shrimp and took a small bite. The spicy, umami, fragrant hotpot soup base concealed the fishy stench of the minced shrimp. It seemed chewy yet smooth with the unique scent of rabbit meat. It made one feel like having the second bite right after taking the first and wishing that one could swallow everything, including their tongue. It was irresistible!

The minced shrimp was made by Ye Shu herself, so she looked at Ye Zhuo nervously. “What do you think, Zhuo Zhuo?”

“It’s delicious! It’s really scrumptious!” Ye Zhuo gave Ye Shu a huge thumbs up. “I’ve never tasted minced shrimp that is so delicious.”

“Really?” Ye Shu was in disbelief.

Ye Zhuo nodded and picked up a piece of minced shrimp for Ye Shu too. “Taste it yourself, mom.”

Ye Shu took a bite and looked rather astonished as well. It was apparent that she genuinely had not expected the minced shrimp to taste this good! After tasting the minced shrimp herself, Ye Shu was confident in the restaurant’s future business! She was fully motivated at once!

After dinner, Ye Sen asked, “My niece, so how’s the renovation with the restaurant now?”

Ye Zhuo updated, “The renovation will be done in a week. When the papers from above are approved, we will be able to open for business.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“So soon?” Ye Sen asked in surprise.
