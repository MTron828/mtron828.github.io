“On the other side, after Lin Qingxuan heard that Wu Mei had been slapped because of him, he was also very upset. He immediately came to visit Wu Mei with Xia Xiaoman. ”

“”Sister-in-law, I’m sorry. I’ve made you suffer so much because of us.” ”

“Wu Mei raised her head and looked at Lin Qingxuan. “Qingxuan, you don’t have to take this matter to heart. We’re family. As long as you and Xiaoman live a good life, sister-in-law’s slap is nothing.” ”

“As her sister-in-law, Wu Mei also hoped that Lin Qing Xuan could continue to be happy in the future. ”

“Lin Qing Xuan nodded. “Sister-in-law, don’t worry. We will definitely not let down your painstaking efforts.” ” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“After leaving Lin Qing fan and Wu Mei’s place, Lin Qing Xuan planned to return to the Lin family and explain this matter clearly to Old Lady Lin. It was not a good idea to continue hiding like this. ”

“Xia Xiaoman said, “I’ll go back with you.” ”

“Lin Qingxuan shook his head. “I can go back alone. My mother is currently in a rage. She will definitely make things difficult for you.”Not only that, her words would also be very unpleasant. ”

“As a son, Lin Qingxuan knew Old Lady Lin too well. ”

“Xia Xiaoman reached out and held Lin Qingxuan’s hand. “We’re husband and wife now. Since we’re husband and wife, we should advance and retreat together. We’ll face all the storms and setbacks together.” ”

“Lin Qingxuan was very touched when he met Xia Xiaoman’s determined gaze. Then, he nodded. “Xiaoman, thank you.” ”

“”Since we’re husband and wife, there’s no need to say thank you.” ”

“When the two of them arrived at the Lin family home, Old Mrs. Lin was lying on the bed and sighing. ”

“Mom!”

Old Mrs. Lin sat up from the bed when she heard Lin Qingxuan’s voice.

She knew that Lin Qingxuan would definitely come back to look for her.

She was Lin Qingxuan’s mother. Could it be that Lin Qingxuan would really sever the mother-son relationship with her?

How was that possible?

“However, when Old Madam Lin saw Xia Xiaoman beside Lin Qingxuan, her expression immediately changed. “Why did you bring her back?” ”

“Xia Xiaoman took a step forward. “Old Madam, I know that you have never liked me, but I am now husband and wife with Qingxuan. I hope that you can accept me.” ”

“”Accept you?”Old Lady Lin could not contain her anger. “Unless I die! Otherwise, our Lin family will never acknowledge you! Why Don’t you see which part of you is worthy of our Lin Family!” ”

“Xia Xiaoman was not angry either, she continued, “In the entire Lin family, other than you, everyone else agrees that I am together with Qingxuan. So, whether you admit it or not, I have already entered the Lin family. From now on, I am a member of the Lin family.” ”

Old Madam Lin was furious.

As expected!

“After Xia Xiaoman married Lin Qingxuan, she revealed her true colors. ”

Shameless!

Shameless!

“Old Madam Lin turned to look at Lin Qingxuan. “Lin Qingxuan, I want you to divorce her immediately!” ”

“”Mom, I Won’t divorce Xiaoman.”Lin Qingxuan’s attitude was very firm. ”

“Old Madam Lin continued, “Let me tell you, there’s no me in this family, there’s no her, there’s no me! You have to divorce her!” ”

“”Mom, don’t worry,”Lin Qingxuan said, “We won’t live here after we get married, so you don’t have to worry about this.” ”

Old Mrs. Lin took a deep breath. “Then we’ll break off the relationship between mother and Son! You can choose between me and this B * Tch!”

Would Lin Qingxuan dare to break off the relationship between mother and son with her?

As soon as she said that.

The air immediately became quiet.

Sever their mother-son relationship?

“”Mom, do you have to do this?”Lin Qingxuan raised his head and looked at Old Lady Lin with a complicated expression. ”

A smug look flashed across Old Lady Lin’s eyes. “Yes! You have to make a choice today!”

Xia Xiaoman wanted to succeed in her position?

No Way!

“”Xiaoman...”Lin Qingxuan turned to look at Xia Xiaoman, his eyes filled with a thousand words. ”

“Xia Xiaoman smiled at him. “No matter what choice you make, I will respect you.” ”

“No matter what, Old Lady Lin was Lin Qingxuan’s mother. ”

“If Lin Qingxuan chose Old Lady Lin, she would let go. ”

“Seeing this, the smug look in Old Lady Lin’s eyes became more obvious. ”

She knew that this trick would definitely work.

“No matter what, she was Lin Qingxuan’s mother. She was pregnant with Lin Qingxuan for ten months and gave birth to him. Could it be that Lin Qingxuan would abandon her as his mother because of a woman? ”

How was this possible?

What was the use of Xia Xiaoman’s methods?

“In the end, Xia Xiaoman could only hope for nothing! ”

“Lin Qingxuan closed her eyes and let out a breath of turbid air. She turned to look at Old Madam Lin. “Since that’s the case, Mom, don’t blame your son for being unfilial!” ”
