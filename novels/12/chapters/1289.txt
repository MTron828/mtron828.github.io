The White Shadow was the number one bounty hunter.

“According to legend, it was fine if the white shadow did not make a move. ”

“Once he made a move, he would not return empty-handed. ”

“Don’t panic.”Ye Zhuo’s index finger twirled around his black hair. “Records are meant to be broken.”

“Carl chuckled. “I knew you would say that. By the way, I’ll be coming to China in three days.” ”

“OH.”

“Carl said, “An, I’ll look for You When I get to Beijing.” ”

“We’ll see.”Ye Zhuo opened the forum. “I’ll hang up first.”

“Seeing the phone being hung up, Carl was depressed again. ”

Over here.

“Looking at the interesting comments on the forum, Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly. ”

A 500-pound fatty?

Killing a person with one slap?

What was more exaggerated was that there were actually people who said that she ate children...

Three children with one meal.

At the same time.

China.

On the third floor of Ranito Casino.

Yala was sitting in his office chair with a cigarette in his mouth. He turned to look at his assistant beside him. “Who increased the bounty on An?”

The assistant shook his head. “I’m not too sure.”

Yala narrowed his eyes. “Investigate.”

He had to investigate.

Because An was his prey.

“Yaler had been in the industry for more than 30 years, and he had never lost to anyone before. ”

An was the first.

“He had studied the surveillance footage for two months, but he still could not figure out how she had cheated at the gambling table. ”

“If she had not cheated at all, that was impossible. ”

Nine out of 10 bets would explode.

“After saying that, yaler continued, “Have you found out her Chinese name?” ”

“The assistant said, “Her identity has been encrypted. It’s currently untraceable.” ”

Encrypted.

It was actually encrypted.

“At this point, the assistant seemed to have thought of something and continued, “Oh right, the person who increased the bounty with An and Hacker Z.” ”

Hacker Z. was originally ranked sixth.

“But now, it was ranked second. ”

Could it be that both of them had offended the same person?

Yale exhaled a mouthful of smoke.

This matter was very strange.

...

“When Father Zhao learned of Mike’s arrest, he panicked. ”

What should he do?

What should he do now?

How was Mike captured?

Wasn’t he an international assassin?

“Captain Li sat opposite him. “Zhao Zhenfei, Mike has already told us everything that happened. Don’t be stubborn.” ” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“”No, I didn’t. He is accusing me! I don’t even know Mike!” ”

Captain Li looked at officer Wang beside him.

“Officer Wang immediately took Mike’s testimony and walked to Zhao Zhenfei’s side. “This is the record of the eight times you asked Mike to do this in the past ten years. If you think that this evidence is still insufficient, we still have audio evidence.” ”

Eight times in the past ten years?

“Upon hearing this, Father Zhao’s face turned pale. ”

They had found out!

They had actually found out!

“”I admit it! I admit it!”Father Zhao was like a deflated rubber ball, his blood flowing backwards. “I admit it all!” ”

“At this point, there was no point in resisting. ”

“Father Zhao continued, “However, I have one condition.” ”

“Speak.”Captain Li looked at Father Zhao.

“Father Zhao said, “I want to meet my son.” ”

He was very clear about his ending.

“If he did not meet ye Sen now, he might not have the chance to meet him again in the future. ”

It was all his fault.

He had let ye Sen down.

“From a father’s point of view, captain Li could understand father Zhao’s current feelings. He turned to officer Wang and said, “Little Wang, go make the arrangements.” ”

Officer Wang nodded. “Alright.”

“Father Zhao said, “Thank you! Thank you!” ”

Captain Li pressed the cigarette butt into the ashtray.

The next day at 11 am.

Ye Sen saw Father Zhao at the police station.

“In just a few short days, Father Zhao had aged by more than a few years. ”

“”Sen, sen.”Father Zhao held ye Sen’s hand tightly, with red eyes, he said, “I’m sorry, but please believe me. I really didn’t mean to hurt you. Before looking for Mike, I didn’t know that you were my biological child...” ”

Ye Sen didn’t have any expression on his face.

“Although Zhao Zhenfei was his biological father, they didn’t get along well with each other, so they didn’t have much father-son relationship. ”

“”Sen, now that I’m about to leave, you should be kind when you’re about to die. “You Child, your personality is like your mother’s. You Don’t have any heart, and you’re not good at scheming. You’ll definitely suffer in the future! Fortunately, you have a good sister, Ye Shu although you do not have blood relations, but I can see that she really treats you as a brother... . .” ”

“Speaking of this, Zhao Zhenfei touched his tears, and then said: “In my life, the two people I am most sorry for are you and your mother... Your Mother is a very good, very kind woman...” ”
