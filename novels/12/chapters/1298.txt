A person like Bai Tang could actually live to a hundred years old!

God was really unfair!

“Zheng wanyin smiled and said, “Grandma, it’s already the 21st century. Why are you still engaging in feudal superstition? ! That’s all a lie. If he could really predict the future, wouldn’t he be rich just by buying a lottery ticket? Why did he still stay here to set up his stall?” ”

Zheng Wanyin was a highly educated person.

She never believed in these things.

She didn’t believe in fortune-telling either.

“With that said, Xie wanqiu felt a lot better. ”

It was a lie.

That fortune-teller must be lying.

“Just like Zheng Wanyin said, if he was really that good, he could just go and buy the lottery ticket. ”

Why did he have to set up a stall?

Cultured people were different after all.

Their brains were much more flexible than hers.

“”In that case, Bai Tang might not be able to live for a long time?”Xie wanqiu raised her head and asked. ”

“”People have their own fortunes and misfortunes. No one can guarantee these things,”Zheng Wanyin said curiously. “Grandma, who is Bai Tang?” ”

She vaguely remembered that the Cen family’s old lady was surnamed Bai.

“Xie wanqiu said, “She’s a very disgusting person. You Don’t know her.” ”

“”OH.”Zheng Wanyin nodded. “By the way, grandma, it’s getting late. Why Don’t we go back first? Don’t let eldest cousin and third cousin wait for us.” ”

“What time is it?”Xie wanqiu asked.

“Eleven.”Zheng Wanyin looked at her watch and answered.

“Xie wanqiu continued, “There’s no rush. Let’s eat first before we go back.” ”

“Since the sisters didn’t take her but grandma, she didn’t need to be polite with them. ”

“Zheng Wanyin opened her mouth and said awkwardly, “Grandma, that’s not good...” ”

“I’m here. You Don’t have to be afraid of them.”

“Zheng wanyin continued, “Second aunt and the others must be waiting for us to go back for dinner.” ”

“Then let them wait!”

“As a junior, what was wrong with waiting for her grandma to Eat? ”

This was what a junior should do!

“Zheng Wanyin could not convince Xie wanqiu, so she could only eat with them. ”

On the other side.

At the CEN residence.

Cen Yuying and Cen Yueying had returned early.

“Cen yueying smiled and said, “What’s wrong, Big Sister? I Was Right!” ”

“CEN yuying said, “Yes, yes, yes. You’re Amazing!” ”

“CEN yueying continued, “You still don’t know who our grandmother is? When we went to her house when we were young, I remember clearly how she treated us and how she treated her biological daughter.”Cen yueying did not like Xie wanqiu, when they were young, she did not like her. ”

She even resisted.

“She probably felt that children did not have memories. When the four of them went to the Zhou family when they were young, Xie wanqiu often rolled her eyes at them and scolded them. ”

“When they were a little older and they entered university, Xie Wanqiu seemed to have changed into a different person. ”

She called them three girls and little yueying.

“If people who did not know about this saw it, they would really think that Xie Wanqiu was a great grandmother! ”

“Fortunately, the two families did not live together. Otherwise, CEN yueying really could not stand it. ”

She really did not know why her grandfather would like Xie Wanqiu.

“CEN yuying continued, “The old lady is old. It is not easy for her to come to the capital. If she can be more tolerant, she should be more tolerant. It is better to be less troublesome.” ”

“Cen yueying glanced at CEN Yuying. “Believe it or not, she must have come here with a belly full of bad ideas! She might want to do something evil again!” ”

“”This is the Cen family, not the Zhou family!”Cen Yuying looked at Cen Yueying. “If she wants to do something evil, she has to see whether our grandmother agrees or not!” ”

“Cen Yuying knew Zhou Xiang’s character very well, so she directly brought up Old Lady Cen. ”

“Cen yueying smiled and said, “Big sister, you’re right.”Old Lady Cen was not a simple person. How could she let Xie Wanqiu do something so easily? ”

“At this moment, Zhou Xiang walked out from the inner room. “The meal is ready. has your grandmother not come yet?” ”

“”Yes.”CEN yuying continued to ask, “Where did they go?” ”

Zhou Xiang shook his head. “They went out with Wanyin early in the morning. I’m not sure either.”

CEN yueying stood up from the sofa. “I’m hungry. Why don’t We Eat First!”

Zhou Xiang frowned. “This... This isn’t very good!” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“According to Xie Wanqiu’s character, if everyone did not wait for her to eat, she would definitely be unhappy. ”

“There’s nothing bad about it.”Old Mrs. Cen walked in from outside. “The children will eat first if they’re hungry!”
