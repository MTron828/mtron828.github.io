Translator: 549690339

Although Cen Shaoqing was talking about retirement.

“In fact, it was expulsion. ”

She had dedicated her life to the base.

“She did not expect that in the end, she would have the reputation of being expelled. ”

She had just been slapped in the face by Ye Zhuo. It was the time when she lost face. She had hoped that Cen Shaoqing would seek justice for her in front of everyone.

Who knew that Cen Shaoqing would actually throw her a retirement letter.

How was she going to gain a foothold in front of everyone?

Professor Yue did not believe this to be true.

She also did not expect that CEN Shaoqing would do this for ye Zao!

She was not reconciled!

Professor Yue was really not reconciled.

“”Fifth Master.”Professor Yue raised his head and looked at Cen Shaoqing, “Ever since the establishment of the base, I have been following behind you. Along the way, I can be considered as half an elder of the Cen family base, not to mention my great achievements! What you have done is really disappointing!” ”

“Elder?”Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads and looked up at Professor Yue. His deep eyes could not see the end of it. “You think you can take advantage of your seniority just because you are an elder?”

Take advantage of her seniority?

Professor Yue’s heart skipped a beat. He could not breathe in or out. He felt extremely uncomfortable.

She had never thought that she would actually take advantage of her seniority in Cen Shaoqing’s heart!

“She had dedicated her life to the Cen family’s base, but she had never thought that in the end, it would end up like this. ”

Ridiculous. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Truly ridiculous!

“Professor Yue took a deep breath, “Fifth master, you will regret what you did today one day. King Zhou of the Shang dynasty, King Zhou you of the Western Zhou dynasty, and Li Longji of the Tang dynasty are all examples of you! The Cen family’s base will definitely be destroyed by ye Zao’s hands!” ”

“After saying this, professor Yue turned around and left angrily. ”

There was no need to wait for too long.

“At most, half a month. ”

“At least, three days. ”

“According to ye Zao’s method of storing the nuclear reactor, there would be problems in less than half a month. ”

“At that time, the nuclear reactor would leak and cause a large area of radiation. She wanted to see how CEN Shaoqing would end up! ”

“Professor Yue came all the way to the office, packed his things, and prepared to leave. ”

“After packing all his things, professor Yue went back to the department and said goodbye to the staff. “Everyone, be quiet.” ”

“Hearing this, the staff all looked up at Professor Yue. ”

“Professor Yue continued, “I have an announcement to make.” ”

An announcement?

“Hearing this, everyone was in a heated discussion. They were all wondering if ye Zhuo was going to apologize to professor Yue in public. ”

“With professor Yue’s position in the department, Cen Shaoqing would definitely make ye Zhuo apologize in public. ”

“Professor Yue’s proud disciple stood up. “Teacher, you’re an old senior in the base. Miss ye has only been here for a few months. She didn’t give you face so easily. Please don’t forgive her so easily.” ”

“Sun Yu is right. We can’t forgive her so easily!”

A group of people echoed Professor Yue’s words.

“Professor Yue looked at everyone with a guilty expression. “I’m sorry, I’ve Disappointed Everyone!” ”

Disappointed?

What was going on?

Everyone looked at Professor Yue in confusion.

“Professor Yue continued, “You can’t wait for Miss Ye’s apology.” ”

“Why?”

“Professor Yue looked at the crowd and said with some difficulty, “Because, because, I’ve retired.” ”

Retired?

Professor Yue was going to retire?

“There was a moment of silence in the air. Sun Yu stood up and said, “Teacher, if I remember correctly, you are not yet old enough to retire this year, right?” ”

“The retirement age for Chinese women was 55 years old, but Professor Yue was not even 50 years old this year, so how could he possibly retire. ”

“Moreover, this was too sudden! ”

Professor Yue had clearly gone up today to study nuclear fission with them.

How could he say that he would retire just like that!

“Hearing this, Professor Yue’s face was full of a bitter smile, but he still raised his head and pretended that nothing had happened. “It’s okay, I’ll retire early and enjoy my life. It’s just a pity that I won’t be able to work with everyone in the future.” ”

“”Why?”Everyone asked, “Professor Yue, why did you suddenly retire?” ”

Professor Yue shook his head. “It’s nothing. I just retired. Don’t people retire when they reach their age? I just retired a little earlier than others.”

Was it a little earlier?

“Actually, it was more than seven years earlier! ”

“To researchers, seven years was extremely precious. ”

But now...

“After he finished speaking.., professor Yue continued, “In the future, when I’m not around, I hope that everyone will work hard and not bring trouble to the members of the other departments. “After I leave, master five will definitely arrange for a new professor to come over. Remember to cooperate well with the new professor... “. “...” ”
