“Hearing this, man Jiangshan immediately turned around and asked, “What did the divination say?” ”

Master Cao smiled and did not say anything. He used his hand to write a word on the table.

Moon.

“Seeing this, man Jiangshan was shocked. ”

“”Master Cao, this...” ”

“Master Cao smiled and shook his head. He continued, “You don’t need to be anxious. The Sun, Moon, and stars, the Sun and Moon are in front, and the stars are behind. If the Princess of man Xing wants to achieve great things, she has to borrow the power of her elder sister.” ”

“What do you mean?”Man Jiangshan asked. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“”Miss Ye is the ruler of changyue. If we recognize her, the two countries will become one. For the Princess of Manxing and the Princess of Manxing, it is definitely not a bad thing,”master Cao said. ”

“Hearing this, man Jiangshan frowned slightly. “But you also said that the full moon is born to restrain her parents and younger sister...” ”

“”It’s okay,”master Cao continued, “Firstly, her surname is Ye. Secondly, she can follow the method of resolving the problem nineteen years ago. “Secondly, she is your biological daughter after all. The two of you share the same blood. Do you really have the heart to let her wander outside?” ”

“Are you sure you want to do this?”Man Jiangshan asked.

“Master Cao said, “Whether you want to do it or not depends on your choice.” ”

Man Jiangshan narrowed his eyes.

“Master Cao stood up from his chair. “I still have something to do. I’ll be leaving first. Mr. President, please consider it carefully.” ”

Man Jiangshan nodded.

“After master Cao Left, man Jiangshan pondered for a long time before finally deciding to listen to master Cao’s advice. ”

“The next morning, he contacted Zhao Dan. ”

“Zhao Dan did not sleep the entire night. When he received man Jiangshan’s video call, he still looked a little tired. ”

“”If you have nothing else to do, go and walk around with Miss ye more. Don’t come back in a hurry,”said man Jiangshan. ”

“Hearing this, Zhao Dan thought he was hearing things. “W-what did you say?” ”

“Man Jiangshan repeated what he had just said, “I’ve thought about it. After all, the full moon is our eldest daughter. It’s our parents’fault to lose her. Now that we’ve finally found her, we naturally want to reunite as a family. Xing ‘er and Wen ‘er are all waiting for her sister to come back.” ”

“In just one night, the entire country seemed to have changed into a different person. ”

“After saying that, the entire country continued, “All these years, it’s our parents who have mistreated her. In the future, let her stay by our side. The four of us will have a good time together as a family.” ”

“But...”Zhao Dan still didn’t understand what was going on. “But what about Xing ‘er?”

The daughter who had sacrificed herself had already been sacrificed. She couldn’t possibly affect a daughter with a limitless future!

“”The full moon is also our daughter, and she’s our eldest daughter,”man Jiangshan said righteously. “As parents, we can’t be biased against each other! This isn’t fair to the child! Don’t ask so many questions. Just do as I say!” ”

“”Okay, I got it.”Zhao Dan nodded. ”

“She had been married to man Jiangshan for so many years, and she knew that man Jiangshan would not make a decision for no reason. He must have his reasons for doing so. ”

“Thinking of this, Zhao Dan recovered a little. He went to the bathroom to familiarize himself with it. After getting dressed, he drank a bottle of top-notch nutrient solution and then took an aircraft to Siyu Pavilion. ”

Siyu Pavilion was ye Zao’s residence.

“The construction was not as prosperous as he had imagined. On the contrary, it was very simple. ”

“”Miss Ye.”Zhao Dan walked to ye Zao’s side, his face full of a kind smile. ”

“Looking at Ye Zao, she seemed to see her daughter when she was young. ”

“The full moon when she was young was exceptionally intelligent, lively and cute... ”

“In the blink of an eye, nineteen years had passed. ”

“”Madam.”Ye Zhuo walked over, his tone clear and shallow. ”

“Zhao Dan held ye Zhuo’s hand and said gently, “I don’t know what’s going on. I just feel very familiar when I see Miss Ye. It’s as if we’ve met somewhere before.” ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled slightly and pulled his hand out. “Madam, please take a seat.” ”

“After saying that, he turned to the butler beside him and said, “Pour tea for Madam.” ”

“Yes.”The butler nodded.

“Upon hearing that, Zhao Dan said in surprise, “So Miss ye also likes to drink tea?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Zhao dan smiled and said, “Then the two of us are really fated. I also like to drink tea very much.” ”

“Ye Zhuo did not reply and said with a smile, “Why did madam come to look for me?” ”

“”It’s not a big deal.”Zhao dan continued, “It’s just that I suddenly felt a little uncomfortable in the assembly hall yesterday, so I went back early and specially came to apologize to Miss Ye.” ”

“”Madam, you’re too kind,”ye Zhuo replied indifferently. ”

“Zhao Dan looked at ye Zhuo and continued, “I heard that Miss Ye grew up in an orphanage. I wonder if Miss Ye has thought of looking for her parents all these years?” ”
