“Chapter 1989: 416: successfully launched, the Cen family’s ultimate secret! 5”

Translator: 549690339

She was able to persist for so many years thanks to Old Mrs. Cen.

“Ever since she married into the Cen family, old Mrs. Cen treated her like her own daughter and never made things difficult for her. ”

Over here.

Old Mrs. Cen had just turned around when she could not control herself.

Tears poured down like rain.

“She lost her husband at the age of 36 and her son at the age of 56. Her life was like a coptis, bitter and astringent. ”

“You are useless. Why are you crying? What is there to cry about?”Old Mrs. Cen patted herself. “You are already so old. How can you be so pretentious? Aren’t you afraid of being laughed at?”

“As she spoke, Old Mrs. Cen seemed to have realized something. She continued, “I am not old! I Am Not Old at all!” ”

The little fairy will never be old!

“As she thought about it, old Mrs. Cen’s mood improved a lot. She hummed a little tune as she walked downstairs. ”

“The servant beside her witnessed everything.”...”she suspected that the old lady was an oscar-winning actress. She could laugh and cry freely, but she had no evidence. ”

Old Mrs. Cen walked downstairs and saw the servant standing there. She was shocked. She thought about how she had laughed and cried just now and felt very embarrassed.

“After all, she was an old lady in this family. Crying and laughing at the same time was too embarrassing! ”

“The servant immediately waved her hand three times. “Old Mrs. Cen, I didn’t see anything just now! I swear!” ”

Old Mrs. Cen nodded in satisfaction. “That’s more like it!”

The servant heaved a sigh of relief.

“Old Mrs. Cen walked to the sofa, adjusted the radio, and continued to listen to the play. ”

She babbled.

“”... Last Night, I met my wife in a dream. She brought brother Jing home, and we looked at each other with speechless tears on our faces... I woke up from a dream, and my wife, Jiao Er, was nowhere to be seen...” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen closed her eyes slightly, and a drop of transparent liquid slipped past the corner of her eye. ”

“The first time she heard it, she did not know what it meant, but when she heard it again, she was already the person in the song. ”

“The maid looked at Old Mrs. Cen curiously, feeling a little puzzled. ”

“She had been working for the CEN family for so many years, and the Cen Old Lady had always been smiling and welcoming. She had never blushed easily with anyone, and she had never been like this before. ”

This was the first time.

What happened to the old lady?

Did she quarrel with Zhou Xiang?

“Thinking of this, the maid turned her head and looked upstairs. ”

“Logically speaking, with Zhou Xiang’s temper, he should not have had any conflict with the Cen Old Lady. ”

That was strange.

Or was it related to the radio.

It was already the 21st century.

The radio had long been obsolete.

“But every time old Mrs. Cen listened to a play, she liked to hold the radio. ”

“The servant didn’t dare to speak, so she could only go to the butler. ”

“Hearing this, the butler frowned slightly. ”

“The Butler had been at the CEN residence earlier, so he could roughly guess why old Mrs. Cen was in a bad mood. ”

“After a while, the housekeeper looked at the maid and said, “Be more alert and pretend that you didn’t see anything!” ”

“The maid immediately nodded. “I know, don’t worry.” ”

The housekeeper nodded.

“The Cen family’s matters were more complicated. As a maid, it was better for many to interrupt. ”

“After sending Zhou Xiang home, Cen Shaoqing came to Mars. ”

Ye Zhuo was still in the laboratory studying the plain jade.

“However, even after studying it for a while, she still did not discover the secret of the Jade. ”

She even suspected that Cen Shaoqing was mistaken.

“At this moment, her waist was hugged from behind. Then, a warm body leaned over. He placed his chin on her shoulder and closed his eyes slightly. ” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

He did not speak.

“After a while, ye Zhuo continued, “What’s Wrong?” ”

“I’m a little tired.”His low voice carried a rare sense of laziness and exhaustion.

“After knowing Cen Shaoqing for so long, this was the first time ye Zhuo had heard him say that he was tired. ”

“”If you’re tired, then rest well.”Ye Zhuo continued, “I’ll go back with you.” ”

“It’s okay.”Cen Shaoqing tightened his arms. “I’ll hug you for a while.”

“After a while, Cen Shaoqing finally let go of her. ”

Ye Zao looked back slightly. “How are you now?”

“”Much better,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“Ye Zao continued, “How’s uncle’s matter going?” ”

“”So far, we haven’t found the exact sea area of the sunken ship,”cen Shaoqing continued, “So many years have passed, and the sea is stormy. It’s almost impossible to find the sunken ship.”Although he knew that it was impossible.., but Cen Shaoqing still persisted after so many years. ”

“”Don’t worry. Hard work pays off,”ye Zao said. ”

“”Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and continued, “How’s the matter with the Jade?” ”

Ye Zao shook his head slightly.

“Cen Shaoqing picked up the jade on the table. As if he suddenly thought of something, he exerted force with his fingers and snapped it. ”

Snap!

The originally intact plain jade broke into two pieces in an instant.

“Without waiting for Ye Zhuo to say anything, CEN Shaoqing snapped it again. ”

Snap!

The two pieces broke into four pieces.

Cen Shaoqing placed the Buddha beads on the table and took the four pieces of plain jade. He walked to the interstellar shuttle and installed the pieces into the groove.

Beep.

The originally quiet interstellar shuttle had a reaction at this moment.

Ye Zhuo looked back at Cen Shaoqing. “Success!”
