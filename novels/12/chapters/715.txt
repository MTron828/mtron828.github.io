Translator: 549690339

“Old Mrs. Cen walked over and said with a smile, “What’s so fun about a competition? It’s only fun if we add a little bit of luck!””

“”Sure, old Mrs. Cen, what kind of luck are you talking about?”Zhou Xiaowan asked.”

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “That... Ah No, if song Chenyu loses, the three of you will line up to call my granddaughter-in-law daddy!””

Line up to call daddy!

“The moment she thought of that scene, old Mrs. Cen became extremely excited.”

“When the time came, it would definitely be very exciting!”

“Old Mrs. Cen might be old for victory, but her mentality was still young!”

“How is it? Do the three of you dare to play?”Old Mrs. Cen raised her head to look at Zhou Xiaowan.

Cen Yuyan didn’t expect Old Mrs. Cen to interfere.

“She didn’t expect Old Mrs. Cen to help her out. She smiled and said, “Grandma, this isn’t fair. What if Zhuozhuo loses?”” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Old Mrs. Cen rolled her eyes at Cen Yuyan. “Nonsense! How can my granddaughter-in-law lose?”

“”That’s not certain. What if she loses?”Cen Yuyan smiled. “Grandma, since it’s a bet, then we have to be fair and just. You Can’t favor Zhuozhuo just because she’s your future granddaughter-in-law.””

“Ye Zao replied indifferently, “That’s easy. Whoever loses will call me daddy.””

“Alright! It’s a deal!”Cen Yuyan turned to look at ye Zao.

“When she heard this, Old Madam Cen was a little worried.”

She was afraid that she had dug a hole for ye Zao.

Even though she was very confident that ye Zao would not lose.

But what if...

“If she knew earlier, she should not have spoken so quickly!”

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “I’ve thought about it. This wager is not good. Why don’t we change to a more realistic wager?””

“Cen Yuyan turned to look at Old Mrs. Cen. “Grandma, if you say anything, it will be impossible to take back what was spilled. If you want to go back on your word now, it’s already too late.””

Old Mrs. Cen wanted to go back on her word now?

No Way!

Ye Zao was definitely going to call her ‘father’Today!

Cen Yuyan felt extremely happy just thinking about that scene.

Ye Zao calling song Chenyu ‘father’in front of so many people...

Would ye Zao still have the face to meet people in the future?

He definitely wouldn’t have the face to meet people.

“At the same time, Song Chenyu also didn’t expect such an unexpected surprise.”

The current Old Madam Cen was simply a divine assistant to her!

“Ye Zhuo looked at Old Mrs. Cen, hinting that she should not worry.”

“When she met ye Zhuo’s gaze, old Mrs. Cen inexplicably heaved a sigh of relief.”

Don’t Panic!

She could not panic!

She had to trust ye Zhuo.

“In order to prevent Old Mrs. Cen from regretting, Cen Yuyan immediately had the club’s staff set up the chess table.”

“Ye Zhuo and song Chenyu sat at two ends of the table respectively. A bunch of onlookers surrounded the two of them, ready to watch the show.”

“One of them was a big celebrity in the entertainment industry, while the other was CEN Shaoqing’s girlfriend.”

“No matter who lost, it would be a big show of the year.”

“In order to be fair and just, the first step was to guess the go game.”

“In chess, the person holding the red go first.”

“Song Chenyu said, “Miss Ye, why don’t we skip the guessing game? I’ll let you take one step, and you take the Red Go.””

It was said that it was better to make the first move.

“Therefore, in chess, the person holding the red chess piece had a higher chance of winning.”

“However, song Chenyu was very confident in herself.”

“She believed that even if she took the black chess piece and made a move later than ye Zhuo, she would definitely win against Ye Zhuo.”

“After all, she had been in contact with chess since she was young.”

Not to mention ye Zhuo.

“Even the president, Old Master song, was once defeated by Song Chenyu.”

What was Ye Zhuo?

“Therefore, song Chenyu didn’t care who took the first step.”

“”Since it’s a competition, we have to follow the rules of the competition.”Ye Zhuo’s tone was indifferent. “If miss song really gives in to me, then my victory will be unfair.””

Win?

Ye Zhuo actually thought that she would win?

“A layer of sarcasm was enshrouded in song Chenyu’s eyes, but he didn’t show it in the end.”

“Alright.”Song Chenyu nodded. “Then we’ll listen to Miss Ye. Let’s play go.”

“Since ye Zhuo did not appreciate her kindness, then don’t blame her for being impolite!”

“In the game of go, Song Chenyu successfully got the red piece.”

What was this called?

This was called a good start.

“Song Chenyu looked up at Ye Zhuo. “Miss Ye, I’ll make a move first.””

“Please.”

Song Chenyu was the first to move.

“Ye Zao’s gaze was indifferent. Without any hesitation, he took a step forward.”

“In this exchange, song Chenyu had eaten ye Zao’s cart, Cannon, and horse.”

“However, in the blink of an eye, Ye Zao had lost five generals.”

“Then, he looked at Ye Zao.”

He had only eaten three of song Chenyu’s minions.
