Perhaps he had experienced too much.

“When Lin Ze talked about Lin Jincheng, he did not have much expression on his face. ”

“Now that he thought about it, something must have happened to Lin Jincheng when he came to Yun Jing last year. ”

“Otherwise, his illness would not have suddenly worsened after he returned. ”

“Thinking of this, Lin Ze frowned. ”

He didn’t know what Lin Jincheng had experienced at that time.

“Ye Sen raised his head to look at Lin Ze. “So, your father also came to Yun Jing to look for Your Mother?” ”

“Lin Ze nodded. “I think that should be the case. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have come to Yun Jing for no reason.” ”

“”Did he see your mother?”Ye Sen continued, “It’s been so many years. Your mother might still be alone, but she might have remarried and remarried. Your father couldn’t accept this blow, so his illness worsened.” ”

Yesen had thought that Lin Ze’s father was a jerk.

He had ignored his mother for so many years.

“Now, it didn’t seem like it was all what he had imagined. ”

Lin Ze’s father hadn’t had an easy life all these years.

“Yesen ate a mouthful of peanuts and continued, “However, it’s also possible that your father couldn’t find your mother in Yun Jing, and his illness suddenly worsened, so he had no choice but to return to the capital.” ”

“Hearing this, Lin Ze’s expression changed. “Uncle Ye, which of these two possibilities do you think is more likely?” ”

“Was it because his mother’s remarriage caused his father to suffer a huge blow and return to the capital, or was it because his father’s illness suddenly became serious that he returned to the capital? ”

“Ye Sen raised his cup. “I think both possibilities are very high. It’s been 19 years, and it’s only natural for your mother to remarry! If she’s still waiting for your father, that means she’s a rare and good woman.” ”

Lin Ze also took a sip of his drink. “But can there really be such a person in the world? Not getting married for 19 years?”

“”Why Not!”Ye Sen continued, “I have an older sister who was cheated by a scumbag when she was young! She even gave birth to a daughter, my eldest niece! After the scumbag disappeared, she raised the child alone and is still single! “It’s a pity that my sister didn’t meet a good man like your father!” ”

“At the end, Ye Sen sighed. ”

Ye Shu’s life was really too bitter.

“In the first half of her life, she met the scumbag, and later, she carried the wrong child in the hospital. ”

“Fortunately, ye Zao came back. ”

“Mu Yourong was not a good person at all. She urged ye Shu to sell her blood, and then she urged ye Shu to sell her kidney. ”

“If it wasn’t for ye Zao, who knows what kind of life they would be living now. ”

Lin Ze looked at Ye Sen in surprise.

He didn’t expect Ye Sen to have a story.

“Ye Sen smiled and patted Lin Ze’s shoulder. “So, Ah Ze, we men must be responsible. We can’t do that kind of thing where we abandon our wives and daughters! Otherwise, we shouldn’t provoke them. Once we provoke them, we have to be responsible as men!” ”

Ye Sen was a very responsible man.

“Unfortunately, he had never met a good man. ”

“”Yes, Uncle Ye, I know.”Lin Ze nodded firmly. ”

“Have you ever tried to ask your mother beside your grandmother?”Ye Sen continued to ask.

“”Yes.”Lin Ze nodded. “But my grandmother doesn’t like my mother very much. She even found me a stepmother and stepsister. She likes that Auntie very much, but I don’t like her, and I don’t like that sister either.” ”

“Ye Sen asked, “What about your father?” ”

Lin Ze shook his head. “He doesn’t like her either.”

Ye Sen frowned. “It seems that all the problems in your family are your grandmother’s fault.”

“From Lin Ze’s words, it was not difficult to analyze that Lin Ze’s grandmother was a person with a deep sense of family status. ”

“She looked down on Lin Ze’s mother, so she had been preventing them from recognizing each other. ”

“Fortunately, Lin Ze was a good child. After so many years, he had never forgotten to look for his mother. ”

“Yes.”Lin Ze nodded. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Ye Sen continued, “The person who solved the problem still has to be the one who solved it. So, you still have to look for an answer from your grandmother. “Ah Ze, you’re a good child. I believe that your mother is definitely a good woman, just like my sister! “So, don’t give up on looking for your mother, and don’t let each other’s lives leave any regrets.” ”

“With Ye Sen’s words, Lin Ze was filled with anticipation for his mother. ”

He was looking forward to the day he met his mother

“The two of them chatted for a long time. It wasn’t until four in the afternoon that Ye Sen sent Lin ze back to the hotel, “Ah Ze, I have to go to country P for a business trip tomorrow. I Won’t be able to send you back to Beijing the day after tomorrow. Remember to send me a message when you arrive in Beijing.” ”
