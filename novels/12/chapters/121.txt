Chapter 122: 079: confirmed date of return, strange bite Mark 1

Lin Ze held his phone tightly as Li Wen’s words echoed in his mind.

It was hard to tell whether his expression was sad or happy.

Seeing that there was no reply, Li Wen asked curiously, “Hello? Brother ZE, are you listening?”

”...”there was still no reply.

“Brother Ze?”

Just as Li Wen was wondering if his phone was broken, Lin Ze’s voice finally came from the other end of the screen. “Are you sure it’s in Yun Jing?”

Perhaps even Lin Ze himself did not expect that his voice was trembling when he said this.

It had been eighteen years.

This was the first time he had heard news about his birth mother.

To Lin Ze.

There was no better new year’s gift than this.

“Yes, brother Ze.”Li Wen continued, “Brother Zhao found the address of the factory and confirmed that it’s from Yun Jing.”

“Mosquito.”

“Sigh.”

Lin Ze looked up at the sky and a smile slowly appeared on his lips. “Happy New Year.”

“Happy New Year, brother Ze.”Li Wen continued, “Brother Ze, do you want to come out early in the morning to set off fireworks?”

“Okay.”

After hanging up, Lin Ze went to the restaurant.

Old Mrs. Lin looked up at Lin Ze. “Who was that?”

“It was a classmate,”Lin ze answered.

“That dog two?”

Lin Ze didn’t say anything.

Old Mrs. Lin thought that Lin Ze had tacitly agreed. “How many times have I told you? You and dog two are not on the same team! Why Won’t You Listen?”

“Mom, ZE has his own circle of friends. You’d better not interfere,”Lin Jincheng said indifferently.

“What?”Old Mrs. Lin Glanced at Lin Jincheng. “Now I don’t even have the right to care about my own grandson?”

“I didn’t mean that,”lin Jincheng continued, “But ZE has grown up now. He knows what kind of friends he should make and what kind of friends he shouldn’t make.”

“If I don’t do anything, Will I let Ah Ze learn from you?”Old Mrs. Lin suppressed her anger. “It’s New Year’s Eve today. I don’t want to argue with you.”

After saying that, old Mrs. Lin looked at Lin Ze. “Ah Ze, I asked your aunt Feng to come to our house for the reunion dinner. What do you think?”

There were three people in the house.

As long as Lin ze agreed to let Feng Qianhua come, Lin Jincheng had nothing to say.

“Grandma, I don’t like Auntie Feng.”Lin Ze sat down. “I don’t want her to be my mother, and I don’t want her to come over to our house for the New Year.”

This was the first time Lin Ze had voiced his thoughts in front of old madam Lin in front of Lin Jincheng.

“Pa!”

Old Madam Lin slammed the table and stood up. The anger that she was holding back exploded in an instant. “You two, father and son, one or two of you, are you trying to anger me to death?”Old Madam Lin didn’t want to get angry during the New Year.

But she could not help it.

Feng Qianhua was so good, a thousand times better than that b * Tch Ye Shu, ten thousand times better. How could she not be worthy of Lin Jin City?

“Cough cough cough...”after getting angry, old Mrs. Lin clutched her chest and started coughing violently.

“Old Mrs. Lin, are you alright?”Aunt Zhang quickly came over to help old Mrs. Lin calm down. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Jin city, Young Master, Old Mrs. Lin’s health is not good to begin with. Why do you have to make old Mrs. Lin angry during the New Year?”Aunt Zhang Sighed, she continued, “Although I am only a servant of the Lin family, there is one thing I must say. Miss Qianhua has sacrificed too much for this family and for the old lady. If not for Miss Qianhua giving the old lady health soup day after day, would the old lady be where she is now? “Even her biological children could not be so considerate, but Miss Qianhua has done it! “Even the coldest stone will be warmed, let alone the hearts of the people.”

These words were accusing Lin Jincheng and Lin Ze of having no heart.

Anyone with eyes could see what Feng Qianhua had done for the Lin family all these years.

But only Lin Jincheng and Lin Ze could not see it.

Aunt Zhang had worked for the Lin family for nearly twenty years and had always been by Old Lady Lin’s side. With Old Lady Lin’s support, she was not afraid of offending Lin Jincheng and his son with her words.

And aunt Zhang’s words had indeed touched Old Lady Lin’s heart.

Feng Qianhua was so good and had given so much over the years.

But the father and son turned a blind eye to it!

They had no conscience at all!

Now even Aunt Zhang, an outsider, knew to stand up for Feng Qianhua.

“Mom, don’t be angry.”Lin Jincheng raised his head to look at Old Lady Lin. “I can promise you anything else, but I can’t do this. I told you a long time ago that it’s impossible between Qianhua and me!”
