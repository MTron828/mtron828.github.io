Li Yueyue did not have much interest in the award. Her main goal was to meet the legendary Niu Hulu.

She was somewhat curious about what the Dark Horse of the science and Technology World looked like!

Ye Zhuo raised an eyebrow. “Didn’t Feng Xianxian Study Finance?”

“Li Yueyue replied, “Her second major is computer science!””

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“When they arrived at class, everyone was discussing about the science and technology awards. Although they were in the chemistry department, many of them had studied computer science in their second major.”

...

At a cafe on the way.

“Although it was not even two o’clock in the afternoon, Li Shang had arrived early.”

“”Sir, what would you like to drink?””

“A glass of blue mountain will do.”Li Shang placed the computer on the table and started working.

“Okay.”

“Time passed by minute by minute. At 2:40, Li Shang closed the computer and went to the bathroom.”

“He tidied up his clothes in the bathroom and washed his face, afraid that he would leave a bad impression on his boss who he had never met before.”

“When he returned to his seat, it was already 2:50.”

Li Shang looked up at the door.

No one came in.

“Another five minutes passed. When Li Shang raised his head again, he saw a middle-aged man walking in with a briefcase.”

“He had a Mediterranean hairstyle, a beer belly, and a Golden Pi Xiu on his wrist.”

He looked like he didn’t lack money. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Could This Be President Ye?

Li Shang frowned.

This seemed to be different from what he imagined president ye to be.

“He imagined president ye to be around 30 years old, young, promising, and Talented.”

“Seeing the middle-aged man walking straight towards them, Li Shang stood up from his chair and asked, “Excuse me, is this CEO Ye?””

“The middle-aged man looked at Li Shang and said, “You have the wrong person. My surname is not Ye.””

So it was not CEO Ye.

Li Shang apologized and sat down.

“At this moment, the coffee shop’s door was pushed open again.”

Li Shang looked up.

She saw a slender figure walking in from outside. She was wearing a simple white shirt and a black cap on her head. The wide brim of the cap covered her facial features.

Her legs were long and straight.

“Although her face could not be seen clearly, she still gave off a cold and chilly feeling. A powerful aura erupted from her body.”

Every step created a breeze.

Li Shang was stunned. University students nowadays were already so stylish?

“Before Li Shang could react, a figure stopped in front of him. “Mr. Li.””

Li Shang raised his head and saw the face hidden under the brim of his hat.

Her features were as beautiful as a painting and could topple countries and cities.

This... This was the Ye of Sitara YC?

Li Shang had watched the live broadcast video of Miao Yin’s third anniversary party.

“Her face was very different from the internet celebrities’faces. It was very recognizable, and he would not be mistaken.”

“YC?”Li Shang did not expect to bump into YC himself in the coffee shop today.

“Ye Zao smiled and extended his hand towards Li Shang. “I’m Sitara YC’s Ye, and also bei Feng Qizhen.””

Bei Feng Qizhen?

“The shock in Li Shang’s eyes turned to disbelief. After a long while, he finally reacted. “You... You’re CEO Ye?””

Ye Zhuo nodded his head slightly.

It was really him!

“Even in his dreams, Li Shang had never expected that the Ye of Sitara YC and bei Feng were actually the same person.”

This was too unbelievable!

How Old Was Ye Zhuo?

Nineteen years old!

“A Kid who had just entered university, was he really that powerful?”

Or was she here on behalf of her boyfriend?

“For a moment, Li Shang could not believe his eyes.”

“He had met many people in his life, but it was the first time he had met someone as young as ye Zhuo who had such a brain. Therefore, he could not help but be suspicious.”

“Although he was suspicious, Li Shang still said respectfully, “Have a seat, President Ye.””

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and leaned over to sit down.

“Li Shang continued, “President Ye, what would you like to drink?””

“Cappuccino is fine.”

Li Shang waved at the waiter. “A cappuccino.”

“Okay.”

“Not long after, the cappuccino was served.”

Ye Zhuo took a sip and narrowed his eyes in satisfaction.

“A moment later, she put down the cup and looked at Li Shang. “By the way, didn’t you say that there was a contract that you needed me to sign?””

“That’s right.”Only then did Li Shang remember the serious matter and took out the contract from her bag.

Ye Zhuo took the contract and looked at it at a glance. “This contract can not be signed.”

“Why?”Li Shang was a little surprised.

“Ye Zhuo handed the contract to Li Shang. “Look, there are problems here and here.””

“Li Shang took the contract and looked at the areas pointed out by Ye Zhuo carefully. Only then did he realize that there was a problem, “We have worked with PL many times. I didn’t expect such a problem to appear this time! Fortunately, CEO Ye, you found it in time!””
