Captain Li walked outside to smoke.

“Just as he lit up the cigarette, chief Liu walked over. “How’s Zhao Zhenfei doing? The higher-ups are taking this case very seriously!” ”

Captain Li handed chief Liu a cigarette.

Chief Liu waved his hand.

“Captain Li continued, “Zhao Zhenfei hasn’t been willing to let go.” ”

“”Even a snake has seven inches, let alone a human.”Chief Liu continued, “We must think of a way to close the case as soon as possible!” ” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Captain Li took a puff of smoke. The thick smoke covered the sadness in his eyes. He nodded and said, “Okay.” ”

“After taking a puff, captain Li came to the interrogation room. “Zhao Zhenfei, I’m giving you a chance to redeem yourself. It depends on whether you can catch him or not!” ”

“Father Zhao leaned back in his chair and said helplessly, “Officer, I’m Innocent! Why Don’t You Believe Me?” ”

“Captain Li asked, “Where is Mike?” ”

“I don’t know Mike!”Father Zhao denied it.

“”As long as you tell us where Mike is hiding or help us contact Mike, we can give you a lighter sentence.” ”

“”I don’t know!”Father Zhao said, “Officer, I’m begging you, please don’t make things difficult for me, Okay?” ”

“”It seems that you still don’t know how serious the consequences of hiring someone to kill someone are,”officer yin continued, “According to Article 232 of the criminal law, whoever intentionally kills someone will be sentenced to death and life imprisonment! Someone like you will be sentenced to life imprisonment at the very least! However, it’s different if you cooperate with us! After all, Mike is a professional killer. Zhao zhenfei, you and your son have only just met. You should think about him even if you don’t think about yourself! I heard that you not only have a son, but also a daughter! You also have a son and daughter. Why do you have to do this?” ”

These words made Zhao’s father feel very uncomfortable.

“If this had not happened, then he would be the proud person in the world right now. ”

But now...

Did he really have to tell the whole truth?

No!

No.

“If he did not tell the whole truth, he still had the possibility of being released. ”

“Once he admitted it, there was no turning back! ”

He couldn’t admit it.

He definitely couldn’t admit it!

“”When you police work a case, do you all like to beat yourself up and confess like this?”Father Zhao looked at officer Yin. “If you didn’t do it, then you didn’t do it. Why are you forcing me to admit it?” ”

Officer Yin was about to lose his patience. “Are you sure you won’t say it?”

“I really don’t know!”

“Officer Yin nodded. “Alright! Then just you wait! When we catch Mike, you’ll be finished!” ”

Catch Mike?

How could mike be caught so easily?

“If Mike was really that easy to catch, he wouldn’t have become an international top assassin. ”

On the other side.

At the hospital.

Zhao Xueyin was thrown directly to the ground floor of the hospital.

“Ever since ye Zao appeared, she could not remember how many times she had been humiliated like this! ”

Nemesis.

Ye Zao was simply the nemesis of her life!

Zhao Xueyin stood up and walked back into the hospital. She had to find Ye Sen and make him forgive her.

She was Ye Sen’s sister.

Her only sister.

Ye Sen could not deny her.

“Zhao Xueyin had just gotten off the elevator when she was stopped by two bodyguards. “Does this lady choose to go down by herself, or do you want us to do it?” ”

“”I want to see my brother!”Zhao Xueyin looked into the room and shouted hysterically, “Brother! Brother! I’m Xueyin, you can’t do this to me! Quickly come out and see me, okay? Brother!” ”

The voice was very loud.

“However, there was no movement from Ye Sen’s side. ”

“In the next second, Zhao Xueyin was taken away by two bodyguards. ”

“On the way, countless people turned to look at the prime minister. ”

In the ward.

“Ye Sen looked at ye Zao, “Zao Zao, I don’t think I need to be hospitalized anymore. Why Don’t we go back?”The main reason was that he did not want to face Zhao Xueyin again. ”

It was too disgusting!

“Unfortunately, people could not choose their own birth. ”

“Sure.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“That’s Great!”Ye Sen’s eyes lit up. “Then we’ll leave immediately!”

“After saying that, Ye Sen seemed to have thought of something and continued, “Wait a moment!” ”

“What’s Wrong?”Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly.

“Ye Sen continued, “T-ah, doctor Gu’s sister seems to be in this hospital as well. I’ll go and greet her before leaving!” ”

“Then you can go. I’ll wait for you here.”

Ye Sen nodded and walked out. He had only taken a few steps when he turned back.

“Ye Zhuo asked curiously, “Why are you back?” ”

“Ye Sen said, “I forgot to ask which Ward Doctor Gu’s sister is staying in. Why Don’t We Forget About It!” ”
