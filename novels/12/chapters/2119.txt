Translator: 549690339

“”Thank you for your kind intentions, Miss Zhuo.”Cen Haifeng declined politely. “I won’t trouble you anymore, Miss Zhuo. I can go back by myself.” ”

“That’s fine too.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Just then, Cen Shaoqing returned from outside. ”

Cen Haifeng went up to greet him. “Mr. Shao is back.”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and did not say anything.

“Cen Haifeng cupped his hands at CEN Shaoqing and continued, “Mr. Shao, I’ve Troubled You and Miss Zhuo for the past few days. After you return on my behalf, I’ll definitely come and visit the two of You Again!” ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Uncle Cen, you don’t have to be so polite.” ”

“”This is what I should do.”If he could successfully remove the forbidden spell and restore his mind, then ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing would be his big benefactors. ”

“After saying that, CEN Haifeng continued, “Benefactors, I’ll be going back first.” ”

Ye Zhuo sent Cen Haifeng out.

...

Cen Haifeng had not returned for nearly a month.

“Now that he had finally returned, Duanmu Phoenix Fei was very excited. She immediately went up to him and said, “Haifeng, you’re back.” ”

“For some reason, when Cen Haifeng saw Duanmu Phoenix Fei again, he felt very disgusted. He turned his head away and acknowledged her. ”

“Duanmu fengfei felt uncomfortable when she felt his coldness. Cen Haifeng hadn’t thought of anything yet, but his attitude toward her was like this. If Cen Haifeng thought of anything, would she still have a place in the headquarters? ”

She had accompanied Cen Haifeng for twenty years.

“In these twenty years, she didn’t even want her own child for Cen Haifeng. ”

She had given up too much for Cen Haifeng.

But what about Cen Haifeng?

Did Cen Haifeng Treat Her as a wife?

“Fortunately, she had found the great elder and the National Master in advance. ”

“Duanmu Huang Fei continued, “Haifeng, sister-in-law and Fengyu are here. They’re in the back hall. Do you want to go take a look?” ”

Cen Haifeng was not in the mood to deal with the Duanmu family. “I have a headache.”

“If it were any other time, Duanmu Fenghuang Fei would have been heartbroken to hear Cen Haifeng say that he had a headache. ”

But now...

He wouldn’t.

Because CEN Haifeng had asked for it.

“”Then you go and sleep for a while.”Duanmu Fenghuang Fei continued, “I’ll go to the back hall and come over to see you later.” ”

“Okay.”

“Duanmu Fenghuang flew to the back hall. Hearing that Cen Haifeng had a headache, Duanmu fenghuang immediately stood up. “Aunt, is Uncle Alright? Why don’t we go and See Him?” ”

“Mrs. Duanmu said, “Fengyu is right. is brother-in-law alright?” ”

“”It’s not a big deal,”Duanmu Huang Fei continued, “It’s probably because of the forbidden technique. I’ve already contacted the Great Elder and the National Master. They will come over to reinforce him soon and completely seal his memory.” ”

“Mrs. duanmu nodded and said, “Sister, you should have done this a long time ago.” ”

“Duanmu Huang Fei smiled and said, “I was the one who was in the middle of this.”He wouldn’t do it again in the future. ”

“”Sister, since you have other matters to attend to, Feng Yu and I will leave first.”Mrs. Duanmu stood up and said. ”

“I’ll send you off.”

“After sending Mrs. Duanmu and Duanmu Feng Yu back, the Great Elder and the Imperial preceptor arrived. ”

“Mrs. Duanmu brought the two of them to the bedroom and knocked on the door. “Hai Feng, the Great Elder and the imperial preceptor are here.” ”

There was no response from inside.

“Duanmu Feng and the national master turned to look at the two of them and said, “They might have fallen asleep. Let’s go in.” ”

“Okay.”The great elder nodded.

Duanmu Feng pushed the door open and entered. The Great Elder and the National Master followed.

“As expected, Cen Haifeng fell asleep on the bed. ”

“Should we wake him up?”Duanmu Huangfei looked up at the great elder and the National Master.

“No need.”The National Master waved his hand.

“Mrs. Duanmu nodded and took a few steps back, leaving the space and time to the great elder and the National Master. ”

“The Great Elder and the National Master took out the tools needed to strengthen the forbidden spell, put down the curtain in the bedroom, and began to strengthen the forbidden spell. ”

Duanmu Huangfei sat outside the curtain and couldn’t see anything clearly. He was a little anxious.

Time passed by minute by minute.

“Half an hour later, the curtain was finally lifted. ”

“Duanmu Huangfei immediately went up and asked, “How is it?” ”

“The great elder smiled and said, “Madam, don’t worry. From now on, the main alliance will never think of anything.” ”

“Really?”Duanmu Huangfei was overjoyed.

“Of course it’s true.”The great elder nodded.

They were still very confident in themselves.

“Duanmu Huang Fei bowed to them. “Great Elder, Imperial preceptor, thank you very much.” ”

“”Madam, this is what we should do.”The imperial preceptor continued, “Then we’ll take our leave first.” ”

Duanmu Huang Fei raised his leg to send them off.

“The Imperial preceptor stopped them. “Madam, please wait. The main alliance really needs someone to take care of it now.” ”

“Okay.”Duanmu Huang Fei nodded and stopped walking to the bedside.

Cen Haifeng lay on the bed with his eyes closed and his face drenched in cold sweat. It was as if he had fallen into a nightmare.

Duanmu fengfei took a tissue to wipe Cen Haifeng’s sweat.

She did not understand why CEN Haifeng still could not forget those people on Earth after so many years.

What was so good about those low-level Earthlings?

“And that mistress called Zhou Xiang, what qualifications did she have to stand shoulder to shoulder with her? ”

“Only she was Cen Haifeng’s official wife. Even if Zhou Xiang had a child with Cen Haifeng, she could only be a mistress for the rest of her life! ”

A mistress that could not be seen in the light.

“If Cen Haifeng had not insisted on bringing them back, she would not have invited the national master and the Great Elder to reinforce the forbidden technique. ”

“Xiang Xiang! Xiang Xiang! Xiang Xiang!”

“At this moment, Cen Haifeng suddenly shouted. Although he was dreaming, one could still hear the urgency in his voice. ”

“Don’t Leave Me!”

“Hearing this, Duanmu Fengyu’s expression instantly turned cold. ”

Just wait.

She would get someone to kill that mistress immediately!

“Just as Duanmu Huang flew up, someone suddenly grabbed her wrist. “Xiangxiang!” ”

Cen Haifeng suddenly sat up from the bed.

“Duanmu Huang flew back and looked at Cen Haifeng. She tried her best to hide the resentment in her heart and said with a smile, “Haifeng, you’re awake.” ”

Cen Haifeng looked at Duanmu Phoenix and narrowed his eyes. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Seeing Cen Haifeng like this, Duanmu Phoenix felt a little scared. ”

“In an instant, it was as if Cen Haifeng had suddenly changed into a different person. ”

“”Hai, Haifeng?” ”

“Get lost!”

“Hearing this, Duanmu Phoenix looked at Cen Haifeng in disbelief. ”

“In the past, no matter how much Cen Haifeng hated her, he would never say this word to her. ”

“”Haifeng, What’s Wrong? Are you not feeling well?”Duanmu huangfei walked over and touched his forehead. “We’re husband and wife. Can’t you tell me what you want to say?” ”

“Cen Haifeng Waved Duanmu Huangfei’s hand away. “Only Zhou Xiang is my wife! Duanmu huangfei, how long are you going to lie to me? !” ”
