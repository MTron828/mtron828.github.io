“However, Ye Han had graduated early, and because she had to carry out some missions, she continued to stay in the school as an instructor. She had only recently returned to the country. ”

“No.”Ye Zhuo shook her head slightly.

“At this moment, ye Han jogged over from the side. ”

“Seeing ye Han come over, Shi Qingcheng immediately walked over and asked, “Why didn’t you tell burning when we were classmates?” ”

“Ye Han said naturally, “What’s there to talk about? Didn’t you also not tell my sister?” ”

Shi Qingcheng rolled her eyes at him. “I didn’t tell her because I thought you would.”

“Besides, she had been busy getting stronger all these years. She was so busy that she didn’t even have time to see ye Zao, so how would she have the opportunity to tell ye Zao All This? ”

“Then you didn’t tell me that you didn’t tell her. How would I know if you told her or not?”Ye Han said.

Shi Qingcheng raised her leg and kicked ye Han. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Ye Han dodged and accurately dodged the attack. He turned to look at Ye Zhuo. “Sister, are you leaving now?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Shi Qingcheng asked curiously, “By the way, who are you going to support?” ”

“My younger brother.”Ye Zhuo did not want to hide anything from Shi Qingcheng.

Shi Qingcheng widened her eyes. “Are you talking about man Wen?”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Shi Qingcheng continued, “Zhuo Zhuo, what are you doing? Are You Stupid? The entire family treated you so badly, yet you’re still going to support man Wen!” ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Man Wen is different from what you imagined.” ”

“No matter which angle one looked at it from, Man Wen was a qualified younger brother. ”

“Shi Qingcheng seemed to have suddenly thought of something. “Then, are you going to help Manwen fight for the position of President?” ”

“”Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and continued, “However, in order not to cause unnecessary misunderstandings, I won’t appear. I’ll leave everything to You!” ”

“”Miss Ye, don’t worry. Just hold onto us!”Mr. Feng stood up and said. ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Also, if Manwen asks, don’t mention me.” ”

“”Why?”Leo was a little puzzled. “It’s fine if you don’t want others to know, but you don’t want Manwen to know?” ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “I don’t want him to have a psychological burden.” ”

Just like Manwen did all those things for her and didn’t want her to know.

“Leo nodded. “Alright, Miss Ye, I understand. Don’t worry. Since you said that you want to hide it from Manwen, then our mouths will definitely be tightly shut.” ”

“En.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Not long after, the aircraft stopped in front of the election hall. ”

“Hearing the sound of the aircraft, everyone in the hall couldn’t sit still anymore. They stood up and looked out of the window. ”

“Seeing the scene outside, the people started to discuss. ”

“I think I saw leader Leo’s Flying Machine!”

“”Is that Shi Qingcheng, the successor of the Aquamarine Country?” ”

“DAMN! JY squad!”

“Mr. Feng!”

“”The last time we saw such a big group, it was at the family recognition banquet of the main alliance, Right?” ”

“”Right, right, right! are our eyes playing tricks on us? Why would these big shots suddenly appear here?” ”

“Don’t tell me they’re here to support someone?”

“...”

“Hearing the discussions, man Xing also looked out of the window. ”

“Seeing Shi Qingcheng, man Xing’s eyes lit up. ”

“Shi Qingcheng was her teacher in school. Could it be that Shi Qingcheng knew that she was participating in the election today, so she had specially come over to help her? ”

“There was also Leo, the JY team, Mr. Feng... ”

“Manzabang, who was at the side, had all his emotions written on his face. He turned around and looked at his father, “Dad! Dad! Look, chief Leo is Here! He must be here to support me!” ”

“Hearing this, a mocking expression flashed across Manxing’s face. ”

She had thought that Manzabang was different from before.

A Fool was a fool.

Would Leo come for a piece of trash like him who could not be helped?

What a joke!

Did he think that he was some big shot in front of Leo?

Wasn’t he being too arrogant.

“”Xing ‘er, do you want to go out and welcome them?”Master Cao asked man Xing in a low voice. ”

Man Xing shook his head. “No need.”

“These people came voluntarily. Even if she didn’t go out to welcome them, they would support her. ”

“If she went out to welcome them at this time, it would lower her status. ”

“She was sitting here right now, waiting for them to come and support her. ”

It wasn’t that Manxing was narcissistic.

It was that she was very sure that these people were coming for her.

“After all, there were only her, Manwen, Manzai Bang, and Manfei sitting here. ”

“Manzai Bang was like a pot of water that didn’t make a sound, half a pot of water that jingled. ”
