Yu sunset was in a bad mood. He turned to look at Ye Zao.

Xian ‘er was going to make things difficult for ye Zao.

“But now, she was actually chatting so happily with ye Zao. ”

What was this?

“Yu sunset looked at Cen Shaoqing again and said, “Then tell me, how many other unknown identities does your little girlfriend have?” ”

“A lot.”Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads.

A Lot? VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“How many is a lot?”Yu Niannian asked.

Cen Shaoqing took a sip of his drink. “I didn’t count it carefully.”

“After saying that, CEN Shaoqing continued, “Just be careful. She has a bad temper. I don’t even dare to provoke her.” ”

Yu Niannian looked at Cen Shaoqing and suddenly didn’t know what to say.

He did not even know how things had suddenly become like this.

“”Cen Shaoqing.”At this moment, ye Zhuo’s voice suddenly came from the air. ”

“Hearing this, Cen Shaoqing immediately stood up and walked towards ye Zhuo. ”

“Leader.”

“”Accompany me to the washroom,”ye Zhuo said. ”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing followed ye Zhuo’s footsteps.

“Xian ‘er looked at the backs of the two people and sighed after a long while, “So the Great God is like us, he needs someone to accompany him when he goes to the washroom.” ”

She had thought that only ordinary people like them needed someone to accompany them when they went to the toilet.

Yu Mumu walked over.

“Hearing the sound of footsteps, Xian ‘er immediately looked up. “Young Master Yu!” ”

“Yes.”

“Xian ‘er continued, “I want to take a photo with Miss Ye in a while. Can you help me tell Miss Ye?” ”

She was a little embarrassed to speak.

Yu Mumu had suffered a blow and could not say anything at the moment.

“Young Master Yu.”

“Seeing that Yu Mumu did not speak for a long time, Xian ‘er called out. ”

Yu Mumu still did not answer.

Xian ‘er waved her hand in front of Yu Mumu’s eyes. “Young Master Yu!”

Yu Mumu finally reacted. “What’s Wrong?”

“Xian ‘er continued, “I’d like to take a photo with Miss Ye. Can you help me tell Miss Ye?” ”

“”Have you forgotten your duty?”Yu Niannian continued, “I’m here to ask you to take a photo with her?” ”

“At a time like this, he still wanted to take a photo with her. was he a pig’s brain? ”

Xian ‘er looked at Yu Niannian with some grievance. “That’s God Ye!”God Ye still needed to probe?

This sentence made Yu Niannian instantly wither.

That’s right.

That’s God Ye!

“Xian ‘er continued, “Young master Yu, I remember that you’re also a fan of God Ye, right?” ”

“Although Yu Mumu did not want to admit it, he could only nod at this moment. ”

“Xian ‘er continued, “Then let’s take a photo with God ye later?” ”

Yu Mumu did not say anything.

No one could understand his current mood.

“Not long after, Ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing returned. ”

“Xian ‘er immediately stood up. “God Ye, Yu Shaoqing and I are your fans. Can We take a photo with you?” ”

“Sure.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“”Thank you, God Ye.”Xian ‘er immediately took Yu Shaoqing’s hand and handed the phone to Cen Shaoqing. “CEN fifth master, thank you for your trouble.” ”

Cen Shaoqing took the phone and took a photo with the three of them.

Kacha.

A photo was taken.

...

On the other side.

Song Shiyu went to the Snack Street that he had gone to yesterday.

He ordered all the things that he had eaten yesterday.

“Cold noodles, stinky tofu, Guan Dong cooking... ”

The only difference was that there were two people yesterday and one person today.

“Boss.”

“Seeing him like this, the assistant couldn’t help but ask, “The Doctor said that you really can’t eat such things anymore?” ”

“Song Shiyu’s current condition was very bad, and the Doctor had also warned him many times. ”

Song Shiyu did not say anything. He just ate like this.

“Boss...”the assistant said hesitantly.

Song Shiyu still did not say anything.

The assistant sighed a little helplessly and silently took out his phone to send a message to doctor Liu. He did not say anything else.

“After doctor Liu received the message from the assistant, he immediately rushed over. ”

Doctor Liu directly took away the cold noodles in song Shiyu’s hands. “You can’t eat anymore.”
