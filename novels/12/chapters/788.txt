“Uncle Zhou continued, “We just want to seek justice for our sister-in-law. Your father left early, so we can’t just stand by and watch our sister-in-law get bullied. Why Don’t you lend a Hand?””

These words were so grand that Lin Jincheng was speechless.

“Uncle Zhou...”

“Sign it.”Uncle Zhou pushed the contract forward.

Lin Jincheng looked troubled.

“”Dad, since the GRANDPAS want to withdraw their investment, let them withdraw.””

“At this moment, the office door was pushed open.”

Lin Jincheng looked up.

“He saw a slender figure walk in from outside the door. Behind her was a boundless snow light, like the light of dawn illuminating the darkness.”

“Zao Zao!”

“Ye Zao walked in from outside. “Dad, sign it.””

Lin Jin Cheng looked at ye Zao with some difficulty. “This...”

Ye Zao handed the pen to Lin Jin Cheng.

Sign It?

Uncle Zhou and the other shareholders raised their heads to look at Ye Zao.

Their eyes were filled with disdain.

“Ye Zao said it was easy. Did she know that once Lin Jin Cheng signed it, he would face a funding loophole that could not be filled with knowledge.”

No wonder the outside world said that ye Zao was a good-for-nothing.

“Now, it seemed that the reason why the rumors could spread was not without reason.”

A good-for-nothing was a good-for-nothing!

“After saying that, Ye Zao looked at Uncle Zhou and the few shareholders and continued, “Grandfathers, once my father signs the contract, you can not go back on your words. Are you sure you want to withdraw your investment?””

Go back on your word?

Why would they go back on their word?

“In any case, they would be able to purchase the LIN Group at a low price soon.”

“Uncle Zhou smiled and said, “Don’t worry, we will never go back on our word.””

“”That’s good.”Ye Zhuo nodded and looked at Lin Jincheng. “Father, since the grandfathers have said so, you can sign the contract without worry.””

Lin Jincheng took the pen that ye Zhuo handed over and quickly signed the contract.

“Since things had come to this point, he could only sign it.”

There was always a way out.

“When Uncle Zhou saw Lin Jincheng sign the contract, he was afraid that Lin Jincheng would regret it in the next second, so he immediately snatched the contract. After confirming that there were no problems, a smile appeared on his face, “Jincheng, your other uncles and I, although we have withdrawn our investment, our hearts are still with the LIN Group. If the group can’t Hold On one day, you must inform us. Don’t worry, we are all on the same side. When purchasing the group, we will definitely not deliberately lower the price. We have to let the four of you have some days to live.””

Lin Jincheng’s expression was a little unsightly.

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “I’m afraid I’ll have to disappoint you. I’ll fill in the remaining holes in the Lin group’s funds.””

“Speaking up to this point, ye Zao took out a black card and placed it on the table.”

Uncle Zhou immediately recognized that it was a diamond grade black card.

Black Card?

This was the black card of the world’s largest bank. It was said that only three people in the world had such a diamond grade black card.

Even Uncle Zhou had only seen such a black card on the internet.

“Then, where did ye Zao come from?”

Could it be an imitation? was she trying to trick them?

“Otherwise, with just ye Zao alone, how could she have such a black card.”

Right.

It was definitely fake.

A sarcastic look flashed across Uncle Zhou’s eyes.

“With just this little trick of Ye Zao’s, he still wanted to trick him?” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

It was simply ridiculous!

“Uncle Zhou smiled and said, “Then I wish you all good luck.””

“Ye Zhuo smiled. “Thank you, Grandpa Zhou, for your kind words. We will definitely get better and better.””

Uncle Zhou snorted coldly and walked out with a few shareholders.

“Lin Jincheng rubbed his temples, looking slightly tired.”

“Ye Zhuo looked at Lin Jincheng. “Dad, if there’s nothing else, I’ll be leaving first.””

“Okay.”Lin Jincheng nodded. “Do You Need Me to drive you?”

“”No need. I drove here.”Ye Zhuo continued, “By the way, Dad, the password of that bank card is Mom’s birthday.””

Password?

Lin Jincheng was stunned. He couldn’t react in time. Could it be... ? ... that this card was real?

“Just as Uncle Zhou and the others thought, Lin Jincheng thought that this card was copied by Ye Zhuo.”

“”Dad, What’s with your expression?””

“Lin Jincheng picked up the black card, his face full of disbelief. “Zhuozhuo, is this card real?””
