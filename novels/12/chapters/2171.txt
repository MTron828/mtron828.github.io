Take Man Xing for example.

“If man Xing really wanted to stop man Jiangshan and Zhao Dan, he would not have waited until now. ”

Leo looked at Mo Gilan in disbelief. “You mean that the little girl just now was all an Act?”

“What do you think?”Mo Gilan asked back.

Leo scratched his head. “Then she was too good at acting! I couldn’t tell!”

“He saw how sincere Manxing was and even apologized to ye Zhu, so he thought Manxing was the only good person in the family. ”

He didn’t expect...

“Leo couldn’t trust Mo Gilan. He turned to Mr. Feng and said, “Mr. Feng, tell me, is she pretending?” ”

He was afraid that Mo Gilan was trying to trick him.

“Mr. Feng Thought for a while and said, “Manxing is definitely not a simple person. Maybe everything that’s happening now has something to do with her.” ”

“Hearing that, Leo frowned. “No, it can’t be?” ”

“Mr. Feng continued, “Did she just say that she wants to persuade Manjiangshan and Zhao Dan?” ”

Leo nodded. “Yes.”

“Just wait.”Mr. Feng looked at Leo. “She will contact us tomorrow and say that she has tried her best and will apologize to miss ye again.”

“Is that true?”Leo expressed his doubt.

“Mr. Feng smiled and said, “Whether it’s true or not, you will know the answer tomorrow.” ”

“What if she really convinced man Jiangshan and Zhao Dan not to go to the Intergalactic Court?”Leo asked back.

“Mr. Feng said, “That means that she is indeed a good person. I was worried too much.” ”

“Then you must be worried too much. You must be worried too much! I think man Xing is definitely not as complicated as you think!”Leo had some friendship with man Xing. “I believe that man Xing will definitely be able to convince man Jiangshan and his wife!”

“Mogilan said at this time, “Why don’t we make a bet?” ”

“What Bet?”Leo asked.

“Mogilan smiled and said, “Let’s bet on this matter. If it is as Mr. Feng said, you will wear women’s clothing and walk around the Central Street.” ”

“What if Mr. Feng is thinking too much?”Leo asked back. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Mogilan said, “Then I will wear women’s clothing!” ”

“Leo Thought for a moment and then said, “Just wearing women’s clothing is not enough. You also have to put on makeup.” ”

“”Yes.”Mo Gilan nodded. “If you lose, you also have to put on makeup. As for what kind of women’s clothing, it has to be decided by the person who wins.” ”

“Okay!”Leo nodded. “It’s a deal!”

“It’s a deal!”Mo Gilan and Leo high-fived as an oath.

The news of ye Zhuo agreeing to the paternity test soon spread to the country of changyue.

Man Jiangshan felt that it was a little strange. He thought that ye Zhuo would refuse.

“However, Ye Zhuo directly agreed and set a time. ”

“”Zhao Dan, don’t you think that this is very strange?”Man Jiangshan turned to look at Zhao Dan. ”

“Zhao Dan was taking care of his hands, “Strange? What’s Strange?” ”

“”It’s strange everywhere!”Man Jiangshan continued, “Why did ye Zao agree to the paternity test?” ”

“”She’s riding a tiger and can’t back down. Other than agreeing, does she have any other choice?”Zhao Dan asked. ”

“If ye Zao dared to refuse at this time, the people of s galaxy would not let him go either. ”

“Man Jiangshan continued, “But if she agrees to the paternity test, how will she step down?” ”

“If she directly refused, at least there was a reason to explain. ”

Unless...

Ye Zao was really not related to them at all.

“Don’t think about that nonsense. She’s at her wit’s end now.”Zhao Dan applied the lotion evenly on the back of her hand. “I would never mistake my own daughter!”

“In fact, before ye Zao was ten years old, Zhao Dan had been quietly paying attention to ye Zao. ”

“She knew that ye Zao was wandering around, and she also knew that ye Zao had eaten his last meal and had not eaten his next. ”

“As a mother, seeing her daughter living such a miserable life, she was really very upset. ”

“When Ye Zao was suffering, she even prayed to the heavens to give ye Zao a quick death, not to torture an innocent child anymore. ”

But this child was like a cockroach that could not be beaten to death.

“No matter what she experienced, she always held her breath. ”

“She remembered that one year, the weather in Changyue suddenly became abnormal. It was snowing in June, and this snowstorm had frozen countless homeless vagrants to death. ”

Ye Zao was also one of them.

“Just when Zhao Dan was glad that ye Zao was finally free from suffering, the little child actually crawled out from the snow. ”

“Wherever she crawled, there was a long trail of blood. ”

“Later, Zhao Dan could no longer endure such torture. She could not watch her daughter suffer, but she could not do anything. She was a mother. No matter what, a mother would always remember her child. Therefore, Zhao Dan was ruthless and directly destroyed the tracking device that was bound to ye Zao. She knew that only in this way.., could she completely let go of this daughter. ”
