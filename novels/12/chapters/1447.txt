“Lian jianbang continued, “Make another chip.” ”

Make another chip?

“Professor ma said, “We have to deliver the chip in two days. There’s no time to make another chip!”Making a chip would take at least a week to ship. ”

“Lian jianbang said, “Then we can only ask for Help!” ”

“Is there no other way?”Professor Ma asked.

“Lian Jianbang stroked his beard. “If even I can’t solve the problem, do you think there’s anyone else who can?” ”

This sentence stunned professor Ma.

“Lian Jianbang was a national-level scientific researcher and had a reputation internationally. Although he had retired from the front line for many years, the current scientific research world still had a legend of Lian Jianbang. ”

Professor Ma thought for a while and turned to his assistant. “Go and invite Master Five.”

Inviting professor Yue back was not something he could invite just like that. It had to be done by Cen Shaoqing.

“”Okay, Professor Ma.”The assistant nodded and walked out of the door. ”

“As soon as the assistant left, Lian Jianbang asked curiously, “I heard that the leader of your base is a young man?” ”

“Professor ma nodded. “Indeed, he is quite young.” ”

“He is so young. Can His strength keep up?”Lian Jianbang asked.

“Professor ma smiled and said, “If his strength can’t keep up, can he create such a large base?” ”

“”That’s true.”Lian jianbang smiled and said, “But if he can crack this password, then I will be truly convinced by him!” ”

“Professor ma said, “Old Lian, what you said is not right. You Can’t even decipher the password, let alone a young man!” ”

“”Ai, the younger generation of the Yangtze River is pushing the younger generation forward. The younger generation died on the beach! If he can’t decipher this password, then it means that he doesn’t have much ability!” ”

Professor Ma waved his hand repeatedly. “I can’t Beat You!”

“Not long after, the assistant invited Cen Shaoqing over. ” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Lian jianbang elbowed professor Ma. “That young man is the leader of your base?”

“Yes.”Professor ma nodded.

Lian Jianbang stroked his beard. “This young man is younger than I thought. His style of dress is quite unique. He looks like a real person. I just don’t know how strong he is!”

“As he spoke, Cen Shaoqing walked to Professor Ma’s side and asked, “Professor MA, did something go wrong when you sent someone to look for me?” ”

Professor Ma stood up and told Cen Shaoqing about the problem he had encountered.

“Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and put down the Buddha bead in his left hand. He leaned over and fiddled with the computer for a while. Then, he raised his head and said, “The password has been cracked. Just inform the production team to continue production.” ”

Cracked?

Three Seconds?

So Fast?

Lian Jianbang stroked his beard. He was indeed a young man. He was too impatient.

“Little did he know that after cracking a password, there were all kinds of passwords coming at him from behind. ”

“Professor Ma walked over and said, “Master Five, you don’t know. This password is like a weed. The spring breeze blows...”the rest of his words were stuck in his mouth and turned into shock! ”

The computer screen displayed a line of English:

“Cracked, successfully! ”

The decryption was successful.

Cen Shaoqing picked up the Buddha bead. “Any more questions?”

“Professor Ma gulped. “No, no more questions.” ”

“Lian jianbang said in disbelief, “The decryption was successful?” ”

Professor ma nodded.

Lian Jianbang immediately walked over to take a look.

“When he saw the computer screen, his face was also filled with disbelief. Just as he was about to raise his head and say something to Cen Shaoqing, he realized that Cen Shaoqing had already walked out of the door. ”

“Lian jianbang hurriedly asked, “Who is that young man? Why is he so powerful!” ”

“Didn’t I tell you just now? He’s the person who founded the Cen family base!”Professor Ma said.

“”Powerful! He’s really too powerful!”Lian Jianbang said with a sigh, “It’s true that when a young man is strong, the country is strong! Old Ma, let me tell you, I’ve met people in my life that I’m convinced of. That young man just now is the first!” ”

“Professor ma said, “I heard that Miss Ye is even more amazing.” ”

“Miss Ye? Who’s Miss Ye?”Lian Jianbang asked.

“Professor ma explained, “Miss Ye is fifth master’s girlfriend!” ”

“Lian jianbang asked curiously, “Really? You’ve seen Miss Ye?” ”

“Professor Ma shook his head. “I’ve never seen her before, but I’ve heard of her. Old Lian, do you know that Dr. YC who studies the Space Mothership?” ”

“I know.”

“Professor ma continued, “Dr. YC is Master Five’s girlfriend.” ”

“”F * ck!”The old man was so excited that he even blurted out the internet buzzwords. From this, one could see how shocked he was. ”

“In fact, when the news of the space mothership first came out, he had scoffed at it. But after meeting Cen Shaoqing today and knowing that Dr. YC was Cen Shaoqing’s girlfriend, Lian Jianbang now somewhat believed it, dr. YC could really build a space mothership. ”

“After all, Cen Shaoqing could crack a password in three seconds that he thought only the person who set the password could crack. ”

“If boyfriends were so amazing, his girlfriend would definitely not be too bad. ”

“Lian jianbang excitedly grabbed professor Ma’s hand. “Old MA, if there’s a chance, you must introduce me to this Miss Ye.” ”

“Sure.”Professor ma nodded.

“After the password was cracked, the production team continued to produce. ”

“In the blink of an eye, it was the day before the base delivered the goods to country L. ”

Professor Yue had thought that Cen Shaoqing would come to her house many days in advance to apologize to her. He had never expected that Cen Shaoqing would be able to delay until the last day.

“Early in the morning, the door was knocked. ”

Wan Sheng ran over to open the door.

“Professor Yue said, “Wait.” ”

“What’s Wrong?”Wan Sheng turned around.

“Professor Yue continued, “We can’t let him come in so easily!” ”

“The door had not been opened inside, and Tang Xue was anxious to death outside. ”

She just had to ring the doorbell and knock on the door with her hands.

“After knocking for about ten minutes, Professor Yue motioned for Wan Sheng to open the door. ”

“As soon as Wan Sheng opened the door, he saw Tang Xue, who looked anxious. ”

“”Little Tang, what happened? Why are you in such a hurry?” ”

It was not surprising that it was professor Tang Xue Yue who came from outside.

“It must be because Cen Shaoqing couldn’t bring himself to do it. He thought that she had always been good to Tang Xue, so he wanted Tang Xue to come and intercede for him. ”

“”Uncle Wan, is Aunt Yue Inside?” ”

“Yes.”Wan Sheng nodded.

“Tang Xue ran all the way inside. “Aunt Yue, Aunt Yue! Something Bad has happened!” ”

“”What’s Wrong?”Professor Yue handed Tang Xue a glass of water. “Drink some water first. If you have something to say, say it slowly.” ”

“Tang Xue couldn’t drink any more water now. With a pale face, she said, “Member a 2 has successfully completed the order. The goods have been delivered ahead of schedule!” ”

“What?”Professor Yue’s face also turned pale.

How could this be?

Cen Shaoqing didn’t come to beg her. How did they crack the password?
