Translator: 549690339

Zhang Qingqing looked at her phone with disbelief written all over her face.

How could this be?

What on Earth happened!

Zhang Qingqing’s comments section was filled with curses.

[ scheming woman is Shameless! ]

[ F * ck! I’m accompanying the old man and being his lover. ]

[ I still don’t know whose child this child is! ]

[ whose child is it? It’s already very obvious. It’s definitely that old man’s! ]

[ Lin Ze is also unlucky! ]

[ he’s indeed quite unlucky. He was actually pestered by such a disgusting woman! ]

“[ F * ck! I was quite sympathetic to her at first. For her sake, I forwarded a lot of Weibo posts. I even went to Yezi’s Weibo to scold her for a long time. I didn’t expect the situation to turn around like this! ]” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“It’s obvious that master Lin has fallen into a trap! He was set up by a scheming woman!”

“This must be the legendary green tea bitch! I’ve really seen it for myself!”

“This woman has really refreshed my worldview! How can there be such a shameless person in the world?”

“”From the looks of that old man, he should be able to be her father, right?””

“”Not just a father, he can even be a grandfather!””

“Zhang Qingqing flipped through the comments, her fingers trembling.”

“In a moment, she switched her phone to the hot search page and saw a hot search.”

# Little Miss Zhang’s incident has turned around #

“Zhang Qingqing clicked on this hot search and when she saw the content, she fell straight down on the sofa.”

All she saw were photos of her and Wu Youyu together.

“Some were walking hand in hand, some were kissing, and some were unsightly!”

There were also her and Wu Youyu’s chat records.

How did these photos get online?

Wasn’t Wu Youyu already dead?

“Zhang Qing Qing took a deep breath, almost unable to breathe.”

“At this moment, father Zhang rushed in from outside. “What’s going on? You were really... really...””

Father Zhang couldn’t say the remaining two words!

He didn’t believe that Zhang Qingqing would be kept by someone else!

He also didn’t believe that these photos were real.

“Although the Zhang family wasn’t a high-class family, they were still a respectable family. Zhang Qingqing was also raised in his hands. He wouldn’t allow Zhang Qingqing to do such a shameful thing!”

That man looked even older than him!

Wasn’t Zhang Qingqing embarrassing him?

“”Vile daughter! Vile daughter! Look at what you’ve Done!”Father Zhang pointed at Zhang Qingqing and scolded angrily, “No wonder the Lin family doesn’t want you! You Shameless Thing!””

“As he said that, Father Zhang was about to raise his hand to hit Zhang Qingqing.”

“Mother Zhang immediately blocked in front of Zhang Qingqing, “Her father! You Can’t hit him! You Can’t hit him! Although Qingqing did something wrong, she’s still a person with a body now!””

“Father Zhang was furious, but when he heard mother Zhang’s words, he still put down his hand and looked at Zhang Qing Qing. He continued, “Let me ask you, whose bastard child is in your stomach?””

“”Lin Ze’s! It’s Lin Ze’s!”Zhang Qing Qing’s eyes were red. “Father, you have to believe me! The child really is Lin Ze’s! The Lin family didn’t want to take responsibility, so they created all this! You have to believe me!””

“Father Zhang was very angry, “What’s the use of me believing! Do you think the Lin family will let someone like you in? How could I have such an embarrassing daughter like you!””

“”Dad, I didn’t do it on purpose!”Zhang Qingqing cried, “I was forced! I had no choice! I really was forced!””

“Mother Zhang also cried and pleaded for Zhang Qingqing, “Her dad, at this time, Don’t blame Qingqing! Quickly think of a way for Qingqing!””

“Father Zhang narrowed his eyes. “Since the Lin family won’t let us have it easy, then we’ll go all out!””

“What are you going to do?”Mother Zhang asked.

“Father Zhang continued, “Come out with me!””

Mother Zhang nodded.

Father Zhang turned to look at Zhang Qingqing. “Don’t Cry Anymore! You’re such a disgrace! Can crying solve the problem now?”

Zhang Qingqing stopped crying.

“Thirty minutes later, a new hot search was added to the trending searches.”

# Little Zhang’s parents speak #

“In the video, Zhang Qingqing’s parents appeared in front of the camera with tears streaming down their faces.”

“I’m Little Zhang’s Zhang Qingqing’s father. Beside Me is my lover and Zhang Qingqing’s mother. I’m sorry for taking up everyone’s public resources here.”

“”First of all, as a father, I apologize for my daughter’s behavior. She’s young and insensible. She didn’t even know that she had been deceived. “Our family’s conditions aren’t bad. Her mother and I are both businessmen. Qingqing has been in our hands since she was young. It’s absolutely impossible for my daughter to be kept by someone else!””
