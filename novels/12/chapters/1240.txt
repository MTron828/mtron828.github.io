Liu Sanniang was speechless.

“At this point in time, Father Zhao was still thinking about the Qian family’s marriage. ”

“Liu Sanniang said directly, “I can’t be Miss Zhao’s matchmaker anymore. Mr. Zhao, you’d better find another expert!” ”

The cat abuse incident was now widely known.

Not to mention the Qian family.

Even an ordinary family would not be willing to let such a vicious woman like Zhao Xueyin marry into their family.

No wonder Qian Dafu had that reaction.

“Now, the netizens had already written in blood that Shunxi Financial Group had fired Zhao Xueyin. If the Qian family were to marry the Zhao family in this storm, the entire Qian Financial Group would be implicated. ”

Qian Dafu’s move was a wise move to protect himself and also to stop the losses in time.

“After saying that, Liu Sanniang turned around and left. ”

Father Zhao looked at Liu Sanniang’s back view and was so angry that his face turned red.

“After a while, Father Zhao looked at the butler. “Contact Yue le news and delete that news immediately!”The most important thing was to delete the news immediately! ”

“As long as they deleted the news, once the heat of this matter was over, there would be a day when everyone would forget about this matter. ”

“Alright.”The butler nodded. “I’ll do it right away.”

“The Butler returned very quickly. “Master, the editor-in-chief said that this piece of news is too popular. He will only withdraw it at this number.” ”

“Seeing the Butler make a ‘ten’gesture, father Zhao asked, “100,000?” ” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The Butler shook his head.

“A Million?”Father Zhao continued to ask.

The Butler continued to shake his head.

“Could it be 10 million?”Father Zhao frowned.

“The butler nodded, “It’s 10 million.” ”

“”10 million?”Father Zhao said angrily, “Why don’t they rob it?” ”

“The Butler looked a little troubled, “Their chief editor said that it’s only 10 million. If you want to delete it, then withdraw it. If you don’t withdraw it, no one will force you. Do you, do you want to withdraw it?” ”

“Ten million was indeed a little too much, but who asked the other party to grasp their weakness! ”

“Withdraw!”

Father Zhao gritted his teeth.

“What Zhao Xueyin had lost was not only his face, but also the entire Zhao family’s face. ”

“If this matter was not suppressed, then the Zhao family would really be unable to establish itself in the financial world in the future. ”

Public opinion would crush people to death.

The power of the masses was limitless.

“Hearing this, the butler nodded. “Okay.” ”

“Five minutes later, when Father Zhao opened the app again, the trending video was gone. ”

“Indeed, money could make the world go round. ”

“Just as Father Zhao heaved a sigh of relief, a new cat abuse trending suddenly appeared. ”

In just ten seconds.

“Father Zhao watched helplessly as the number of comments on the video went from 0 to 1W, followed by 10W, 15W... ... the popularity was getting higher and higher every second. ”

This was too untrustworthy.

“They had clearly agreed to delete the video, what was going on now? ”

This was too lacking in the spirit of a contract!

Father Zhao called the butler over with a cold face.

“”Master, don’t be anxious. I’ll go and contact chief editor Wu right away.” ”

“Go quickly!”

“Soon, the Butler returned. He did not know how to open his mouth. “Master...” ”

“Speak!”Father Zhao’s expression was extremely cold.

“The Butler kept wiping the cold sweat off his forehead, “Editor-in-chief Wu said that the video that was just commented on for a million yuan has indeed been deleted. The new video that appeared now was uploaded by another user. It has nothing to do with them. If you want to continue to delete the video, you can take out another ten million yuan...”. :. .” ”

Robbery by fire!

This is robbery by fire!

This is outrageous!

“”Pa!”Zhao fu directly pounded the table to rise, the blue vein on the face bulges. ”

“The steward braced himself and said, “What do you think we should do about this?” ”

“Give them another ten million!”

“At this point, we can only continue to pay the money. ”

He doesn’t believe there’s gonna be any more hits.

“Okay.”

The Butler immediately went to do it.

“Another five minutes passed. When Father Zhao turned on his phone again, a new video appeared. ”

“And this time, it was not one, but ten! ”

“This time, it was not only Zhao Xueyin who was exposed, but also his father! ”

“Having a daughter who was cruel and bloody, presumably her father would not be any better. ”

There were also powerful netizens who even dug up the past of Father Zhao’s adult life.

“Looking at those past events, Father Zhao’s hands were trembling with anger. ”

He had always paid attention to his reputation.

But the news that was trending on the internet was simply rubbing his reputation on the ground.

It was intentional!

Someone must be manipulating it from behind.

“Otherwise, the cat abuse video would not have been posted online. ”

I do not know Zhao Xueyin exactly offended someone!

Just then Zhao Xueyin came down from upstairs.
