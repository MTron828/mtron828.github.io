The three sisters immediately sat down.

“CEN Shaoqing said slowly, “Grandma, Mom, Big Sister, second sister, and third sister, what I’m going to say next might be a little hard for you to accept. You must be mentally prepared.” ”

“Okay.”Cen Yuying nodded.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Dad is still alive. He wasn’t taken away from the shipwreck.” ”

“As soon as he said that, it was as if a pause button had been pressed in the air. ”

There was no sound around them.

“”What... What did you say?”Zhou Xiang held Cen Shaoqing’s hand tightly. Her face was full of disbelief as she widened her eyes and asked, “Shaoqing, what did you say? What happened to Your Dad?” ”

Old Mrs. Cen and the other three sisters also looked surprised.

“If they had not heard Zhou Xiang’s words, they would have thought that they were hearing things. ” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Cen Haifeng was not dead?

“If Cen Haifeng was not dead, then where was he now? ”

“So many years had passed, why had he never returned home? ”

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “He is not dead.” ”

Not Dead?

Cen Haifeng was not dead!

“”Shaoqing, are you kidding me?”Zhou Xiang looked at Cen Shaoqing. ”

“”I’m not joking with you,”Cen Shaoqing said. “He’s indeed not dead.” ”

“Hearing this, Zhou Xiang’s face was filled with both tears and laughter. ”

Her long-cherished wish had finally come true!

“Then where is he now?”Old Mrs. Cen stood up from her chair. “Tell that unfilial son to get out! I want to ask him personally why he hasn’t returned home after so many years!”

“Thinking of Zhou Xiang’s suffering all these years and the tears she shed in the dead of night, Old Mrs. Cen was furious. ”

“”Grandma, don’t be anxious. Let me tell you slowly,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

Old Mrs. Cen sat back down on the sofa. “Tell me.”

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Outside the Milky Way, there is a galaxy called the s galaxy. There are a total of four countries in the S galaxy. They are changyue, Manxing, the bug race, and the General Alliance. Among them, the General Alliance is the leader of the other three countries... ... ...” ”

“”Stop, Stop!”Old Mrs. Cen said impatiently, “I asked you to tell me about your father, why are you talking about this with me?” ”

She was not interested in listening to this now.

“Please listen to me.”

“”Okay.”Old Mrs. Cen nodded, “Continue.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing continued, “The General Alliance has always had an unwritten rule. The future leaders must be born and raised on Earth until they get married and have children before they are brought back by the General Alliance. After they are brought back by the General Alliance...” ”

“Hearing this, Cen Yu reacted and looked at Cen Shaoqing. “Shaoqing, you mean that our father is the leader of the General Alliance.” ”

“”Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and continued, “Not only our father, but also grandfather, great grandfather, great grandfather, great grandfather, great grandfather, great grandfather... They are all the leaders of the General Alliance.” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen’s face was slightly pale. “Then, then your grandfather didn’t leave by accident?” ”

“Yes.”

“Then why didn’t grandfather and Father Come Back?”Cen Yuying frowned.

“”In the main alliance, there is an ancient forbidden spell that has been passed down for many years. Those who are affected by the forbidden spell will forget about their future,”Cen Shaoqing said slowly, “They are affected by the forbidden spell and forget everything. After they return to the main alliance, they will get a new wife.” ”

Get a new wife?

“Hearing this, Zhou Xiang raised her head and looked at Cen Shaoqing. There was no expression in her eyes. ”

“After a long while, she raised her head to look at Cen Shaoqing. “What did you say?” ”

“”Mom, I don’t want to lie to you.”Cen Shaoqing looked at Zhou Xiang and continued, “He already has a wife in the General Alliance.” ”

He has a wife.

He has a wife.

“A smile appeared on Zhou Xiang’s lips. Then, her vision went dark and she fainted just like that. ”

“Mom!”

The three CEN sisters immediately pounced on her.

“Old Mrs. Cen sat on the sofa, unable to regain her senses for a long time. ”

“She never thought that one day, she would hear the news of CEN Haifeng in such a way. ”

Live.

Marry another.

Abandon their wives and children.

“No matter what kind of excuse they had, abandoning their wives and children to marry another, they were all full of scumbags. ”

Poor Zhou Xiang had actually stayed by his side for so long.

“Thinking of this, Old Mrs. Cen turned to look at Zhou Xiang. “Xiang Xiang, Xiang Xiang, are you okay?” ”

“Zhou xiang fainted on the sofa. No matter how the three CEN sisters performed first aid, she showed no signs of waking up. ”

Cen Shaoqing contacted the family doctor.

“Old Mrs. Cen walked up to Cen Shaoqing. “Shaoqing, what is going on?” ”

“”It’s exactly what I told you.”CEN Shaoqing continued, “He lost his memory and married someone else.” ”

“”How did you know? Could it be a mistake?”Old Mrs. Cen asked, “Your father died a long time ago! That person is definitely not your father!” ”

Old Mrs. Cen would rather believe that Cen Haifeng had died than face the fact that Cen Haifeng had lived and married someone else.

“”No.”Cen Shaoqing shook his head. “To tell you the truth, I did not go out with burning to do experiments. Instead, we went to the General Alliance.” ”

“”So, you saw that unfilial son?”Old Mrs. Cen asked. ”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Then why didn’t you beat him to death!” ”

“”Grandma, now is not the time to joke,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“Who joked with you?”Old Mrs. Cen looked at Cen Shaoqing.
