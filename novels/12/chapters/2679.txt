Translator: 549690339

“Okay.”

“The butler continued, “Do you have any dietary restrictions?” ”

“”Dietary restrictions?”Ye Sui was stunned for a moment, then he said, “No dietary restrictions.” ”

“What would you like to drink?”The Butler asked.

“Ye Sui asked, “What do you have?” ”

“”We have milk tea and various fruit juices, as well as coffee and milk.” ”

“Ye Sui said, “Two cups of Orange Juice.” ”

“”Okay, please wait a moment.” ”

The Butler went to prepare the food.

“Soon, a servant pushed the dining cart over. ”

The food was very sumptuous.

“There were only two people, but there were eight dishes. ”

“The dishes looked, smelled, and tasted good. They were more delicious than any of the cuisines ye Sui had ever eaten. ”

“Ye Sui continued, “This is how it feels to be a master. If you follow Feng Yang, you won’t be able to have this kind of life for the rest of your life.” ”

“How do you know that Feng Yang won’t become a person above others in the future?”Zhou Ziyue asked.

“Hearing that, ye Sui laughed out loud. “Become a person above others? How can he become a person above others? Do you think that anyone can become a person above others?” ”

Crazy!

Zhou Ziyue was really crazy!

She actually thought that Feng Yang could also become a person above others.

What right did Feng Yang have?

What a joke!

“Zhou ziyue continued, “Mom, don’t look down on Feng Yang. In this world, there are many rich people who started from scratch!” ”

“So you believe that Feng Yang can also start from scratch?”Ye Sui asked.

“Without waiting for Zhou Ziyue to say anything, ye Sui continued, “I said, I will never interfere in your affairs again! If you are willing to follow Feng Yang, no one will stop you! As a mother, I have done my duty. The rest of the road is up to you. It has nothing to do with me!” ”

“The more ye Sui said this, the more uncomfortable Zhou Ziyue felt. ”

She stopped talking and lowered her head to eat.

“Ye Sui wished he could slap Zhou Ziyue and wake her up. However, she was his daughter after all. If she really had to slap Zhou Ziyue, she really couldn’t bear to part with her. ”

In the front hall.

The full moon banquet was still going on.

Ye Shu walked to Lin Jincheng’s side and told him about ye Sui.

“Hearing this, Lin Jincheng asked, “When did they arrive?” ”

“”Just now,”ye Shu answered. ”

“Lin Jincheng continued, “Have you settled down?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Shu nodded.

“”It’s good that you’ve settled down,”Lin Jincheng continued, “Ye Sui helped us before. Don’t mistreat her.” ”

“Lin Jincheng was a person who knew how to repay kindness. Although ye Sui’s character wasn’t good, he had helped them before. ”

“I know that.”

“Lin Jincheng continued, “Only ye Sui and her mother came?” ”

“”I think so,”ye Shu said. ”

“Ye Shu’s relationship with the others had been completely severed, so they didn’t have much face to come. ” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Lin Jincheng pinched his temples. “Ye Sui must have come with a purpose. As long as it’s not something too excessive, try to comply with her.” ”

“Although a long time had passed, Lin Jincheng was still clear about ye Sui’s character. ”

Ye Sui suddenly came to their door. He must have a purpose.

“Okay.”

“After the full moon banquet ended, Ye Shu told Lin Ze and ye Zhuo about this matter. ”

“Lin Ze was not very clear about ye Sui’s character. “Mom, as long as it’s not some top-notch relative, it’s fine.” ”

“Ye Shu said, “Your second aunt’s character is a little bad, but she’s not an unreasonable person.” ”

“”Second aunt?”Ye Zhuo continued, “When you were down and out, why didn’t you see this second aunt come to help you in the midst of a difficult situation? The icing on the cake comes quickly.” ”

She didn’t recognize this second aunt.

“Ye Shu explained, “She was a little snobbish, but when I was in the most difficult time, she lent me three hundred yuan. If I didn’t have that three hundred yuan, I really didn’t know what to do at that time.” ”

“”You returned 600 yuan in the end, right?”Ye Zhuo asked back. ”

Ye Shu didn’t say anything.

“Am I right?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“Ye Shu said, “At that time, no one’s life was easy. Let’s not bother with the matter of a few hundred Yuan with her.”Now that ye Sui had come from afar, ye Shu thought, let the past be the past.., there was no point in dwelling on the past. ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “You can repay the favor you should repay. I’m just reminding you not to be ordered around like a fool.” ”

“”Don’t worry, I Won’t,”Ye Shu said. ”

“At this moment, ye Zhuo’s phone rang. ”

“Picking up the phone, ye Zhuo’s expression changed. “Okay, I’ll be there right away.” ”

“After hanging up, she looked at everyone. “Dad, Mom, I still have something to do. I have to go to the base and won’t be back tonight.” ”

“Then you should hurry up and get busy!”

“Lin Jincheng immediately picked up the car keys. “Zao Zao, let me send you off!” ”

“”No need. Cen Shaoqing is here to pick me up.”Ye Zao said, “He’s already at the door.” ”

“Hearing this, Lin Jincheng could only put down the car keys and watch ye Zao’s back disappear outside the door. ”

“Ye Shu continued, “Ah Ze, go and call Jingshu over. I’ll bring you to meet second aunt.” ”

“Okay.”Lin Ze nodded slightly.

“Not long after, Lin Jincheng, Ye Shu, Lin Ze, and Bai Jingshu arrived at the guest room. ”

Ye Shu reached out and knocked on the door.

“Soon, the door opened. ”

“It’s Little Shu!”Ye Sui was rather enthusiastic.

Ye Shu nodded. “Sister.”

“Ye Sui saw that there were other people behind ye Shu. He opened the door and said, “Come in and talk.” ”

The few of them walked inside.

“When they reached the inner room, Ye Sui looked at Lin Jincheng. “Qing Cheng, long time no see. You’re still the same as when you were young.” ”

Qing Cheng.

“It had been a long time since someone had called him by this name. In an instant, Lin Jincheng seemed to have returned to the past. ”

“Second sister.”

“Ye Sui looked at Lin Ze again. “This is Ah Ze, right?” ”

“Second aunt.”Lin Ze greeted her politely.

“What about this person? Is this burning?”Ye Sui looked at Bai Jingshu with some uncertainty.

“She had seen ye Zao once before and felt that ye Zao did not look like this either, but she was not sure either. ”

“”This is Ah Ze’s wife, Bai Jingshu.” ”

“Bai Jingshu said politely, “Second aunt.” ”

“Ye Sui said in surprise, “Oh my God! Ah Ze already has a wife! Our Ziyue is still single!” Ye Sui held Lin Ze’s hand. “Ah Ze, do you have any single young men by your side? Introduce one to your cousin.” ”

Those who could become good friends with Lin Ze were all wealthy.

“Lin Ze pulled his hand back without a trace. “Okay, second aunt. I’ll keep an eye out for you.” ”

“”Okay, then I’ll have to trouble you.”Ye Sui praised, “Such a good child!” ”
