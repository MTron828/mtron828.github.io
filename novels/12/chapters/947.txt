Translator: 549690339

She originally wanted to have a good talk with Cen Yuyan.

But Cen Yuyan had no intention of having a good talk with her at all.

“”Mom, what are you doing?”Cen Yuyan was stunned for a moment before she reacted.”

“Zhou Xiang said, “I’m letting you wake up! Fourth Lass, you’re really disappointing me more and more! Just like what your grandmother said, sooner or later, you’ll regret it! When that time comes, don’t come crying in front of me!””

“Cen Yuyan wiped her face. “The ones who should regret it are all of you! Mom, just wait and see! Sooner or later, all of you will see the truth, and Zhou Rui will also make all of Your Eyes Light Up!””

“At that time, other than her, no one else would be able to climb up to Zhou Rui!”

Zhou Xiang picked up her bag and turned around to leave.

“Zhou Rui was waiting outside the door. When he saw Zhou Xiang walk out of the room with a body full of anger, he was shocked. “Auntie?””

Zhou Xiang did not even look at him and walked past him directly.

“Then, Cen Yuyan walked out as well.”

“”Yuyan, what happened? Did you and Auntie Quarrel Again?”Zhou Rui hurriedly asked.”

“Cen Yuyan said, “Anyway, we’re not a family anymore.””

“Zhou Rui frowned without a trace. “Auntie Yuyan is already so old. Don’t lower yourself to her level. In the end, she’s doing this for your own good...””

Cen Yuyan turned to look at Zhou Rui. “Stop talking. I don’t want to hear this right now!”

She could finally see that the CEN family had no place for her now.

“Luckily, she had found a good boyfriend.”

“Otherwise, she really didn’t know what she should do next.”

Zhou Rui didn’t say anything more and helped Cen Yuyan into the car.

“In the blink of an eye, another week passed.”

“This morning, Cen Yuyan had just woken up to change her clothes when she felt dizzy and then fainted.”

“When CEN Yuyan woke up again, she was lying on the hospital bed.”

“Seeing that she had woken up, Zhou Rui said excitedly, “Yuyan, you’re Awake?””

Cen Yuyan felt very uncomfortable and pinched her temples. “What’s wrong with me?” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Zhou Rui held Cen Yuyan’s hand and said, “Yuyan, you’re pregnant.””

“What?”Cen Yuyan was stunned.

Pregnant?

“Zhou Rui nodded. “Yes, you’re pregnant. We’re going to be parents.”Zhou Rui was very excited. He had waited for so long and finally had this child.”

“In the future, he would be the legitimate son-in-law of the Cen family!”

He would also be the future successor of the CEN family.

“CEN Yuyan continued, “But don’t we always have contraception? How can I be pregnant?”Cen Yuyan did not want to have a child, firstly, she was too old. There would definitely be risks during childbirth. How many elderly pregnant women had died in the delivery room?”

“Secondly, she did not like children. Not only did she not like them, she also hated them.”

“Now that she heard that she was actually pregnant, other than being in disbelief, Cen Yuyan found it hard to accept.”

How could she be pregnant?

“Although Zhou Rui had said that he wanted to have a child before, Cen Yuyan had never taken it to heart.”

That was because they had always used contraception.

“She thought that Zhou Rui did not like children like she did, and that he had always said that he wanted to have a child.”

She did not expect that she was actually pregnant.

“Zhou Rui held Cen Yuyan’s hand and said, “This shows that this child is fated to be with us. He is destined to become a family with us.””

“This child can not be taken.”Cen Yuyan withdrew her hand.

“Why?”Zhou Rui looked at Cen Yuyan in disbelief.

Can not be taken?

“Without a child, how could he firmly tie down the label of Cen family’s son-in-law?”

This child had to stay.

“Cen Yuyan said, “There’s no such thing as having a child in my life plan.””

“Zhou Rui frowned. “Yuyan, you’ve changed. You’re different from before. You clearly promised me that you would give birth to a child for me.””

“At this point, Zhou Rui stood up and looked at Cen Yuyan with a self-deprecating look in his eyes, “That’s right. You’re a young miss from a rich family. I’m just from the countryside. How can you really like me? It’s fake! All of this is fake!””

“Hearing Zhou Rui’s words, Cen Yuyan panicked and quickly said, “Zhou Rui, it’s not like that. It’s not that I don’t love you. I just don’t want this child!””

“”A child is the crystallization of love. Since you love me, Why Can’t you accept our child?”Zhou Rui looked at Cen Yuyan. “You’ve clearly changed your heart!””

“Having been with Cen Yuyan for so long, Zhou Rui understood Cen Yuyan too well. Cen Yuyan was a person who could be tricked with just a little provocation.”
