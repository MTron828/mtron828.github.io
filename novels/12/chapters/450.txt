Oh My God!

It’s true!

Li Shang’s face was filled with disbelief.

“Meanwhile, a bigger search engine was already on the list. ”

# Sitara YC’s Ye has signed with the world! #

# the world! #

# Sitara YC’s Ye #

“Seeing these hot searches, Li Shang screenshot and sent it to Ye Zhuo. [ don’t need to find a marketing number to send out a draft, this side has already been on the hot search engine! ] ”

Ye Zhuo was stunned.

She didn’t expect it to be so fast.

Because she had just changed the information.

It hadn’t even been three minutes.

“If ye Zhuo wasn’t a tech guru, she would have even suspected that these people had installed surveillance cameras on her body. ”

“Many fans followed the hot searches and left messages on ye Zhuo’s previous videos, asking if the hot searches were real. ”

“Ye Zao then released a statement: [ Yes, I have officially signed a contract to travel the world! ]! Babies, please rest assured, ye Zao is still the same old ye Zao! Nothing will change because of the signing company. Then, because of the recent military training, there will be no live broadcast for the time being. Let’s meet in half a month. ] ”

[ see you in half a month. ]

“-LSB- congratulations,Zao zao! ] ”

“Go for it, leaf. Regardless of whether you have signed with a company or not, whenever you turn around, your fans will be there ”

“I’m guessing that the CEO of World Under Heaven Is Lady Boss, because I just checked. World Under Heaven is a new company that has just registered. Lady Boss spent a lot of money for leaf. It’s not a big deal to open a company, right ”

[ F * ck! F * ck! The real-life story of the overbearing CEO and his little wife! ]

[ lady boss is too awesome! 666666! ]

“For a moment, everyone was hooked on the couple between Ye Zhuo and the mysterious lady boss! ”

“Not long after, the news that Sitara YC’s Ye had signed with world under heaven was known by everyone. ”

“After many streamers learned of this news, they did not hesitate to cancel their contracts with the current company at all costs. They all signed with World Under Heaven. ”

“In less than three days, world of Xing had more than 30 popular streamers! ”

Li Shang was so busy that she finally found the feeling she had before.

Ye Zhuo had been busy participating in military training.

“Because he had his period, his condition was not very good. ”

“Fortunately, Gu Zuocheng did not make things difficult for her. ”

The Cen family.

“Cen Shaoqing had been back for more than ten days, but the CEN sisters still had not seen their legendary future sister-in-law. ”

“Cen Yueya was extremely anxious. “Five, Shaoqing! When are you going to bring my sister-in-law back for me to see?” ”

“Hearing this, Cen Yueying, the third sister, also came over. “That’s right, Shaoqing, when are we going to see our future sister-in-law?” ”

The two sisters were really too curious.

What kind of person would be able to attract Cen Shaoqing’s heart? Damn it

“Cen Shaoqing sat in front of the desk, holding the Buddhist beads in one hand and turning a page of the Buddhist scriptures on the desk with the other. When he heard this, he slowly lifted his eyelids. Following this action, the Red Mole at the end of his eyes also became lively, it added some charm. “No Rush.” ”

“”No Rush?”Cen Yueya’s eyes widened. “Your second sister is about to explode from anxiety, okay?” ”

Cen Shaoqing continued to read the Buddhist scriptures.

“Cen yueying walked to Cen Shaoqing’s side. “Shaoqing, please satisfy my and second sister’s curiosity! Why Don’t you tell me my Sister-in-law’s name? Second sister and I will go directly to the capital university to look for her!” ”

“”Yes, yes! Third Girl is especially right!”Cen Yueya hurriedly nodded. ”

“No.”Cen Shaoqing directly refused.

Cen Yueya frowned. “Why?”

Cen Shaoqing raised his eyes and glanced at CEN Yueya. “You will scare her.”

“Your sister is as beautiful as a flower. She is naturally beautiful. She is like a fish that has fallen from the sky. She is devastatingly beautiful. She is peerless in her generation. She has the beauty of a nation. She is from a small family. She is slim and graceful. She is like a willow that has fallen into the wind. She is like a beautiful flower that shines on the water. How can she scare people?”

Cen Yueya placed her hands on her hips and said a whole bunch of words in one breath. She did not even breathe.

“Cen Yueying, who was beside her, was stunned. She gave Cen Yueya a thumbs up. “Second sister, you’re Awesome!” ”

“Cen Yueya raised her head proudly. “Of course! Otherwise, how could I be your second sister!”As she said that, Cen Yueya looked at Cen Shaoqing. “When are you going to bring her back to see us? Otherwise, I’ll go to the capital university to look for her!” ”

Cen Shaoqing felt a headache coming on as he pinched his temples. “I have to ask her.”

Ye Zhuo’s military training was still five days away.

Cen Shaoqing had not seen her for more than ten days.

Cen Yueya patted Cen Shaoqing on the shoulder. “Sister has a question for you.”

“Ask.”Cen Shaoqing answered concisely.

“CEN Yueya continued, “If you two get married in the future, will you be strict with your wife?” ”
