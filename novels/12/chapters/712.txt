Old Mrs. Cen rolled her eyes at Cen Yuyan.

What a brainless thing!

How could she have such a brainless granddaughter?

“”Yuyan is right. Let’s all take a seat first,”song Chenyu followed. ” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Because the CEN family had joined in, the others in the private room became much more reserved. ”

Old Mrs. Cen pulled ye Zhuo to sit beside Cen Shaoqing.

“After sitting down, Old Mrs. Cen said in a low voice, “Ye, let me tell you, that ugly fish is not a good person! She’s just a scheming little lotus! You mustn’t be like the ignorant fourth brother and have a heart-to-heart with her!” ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “I know.”

“Having fought with song Chenyu so many times, she naturally knew what song Chenyu was thinking. ”

“Madam Cen was afraid that Ye Zhuo would be deceived by song Chenyu, so she continued, “Ye, you know who the ugly fish I’m talking about is, right?” ”

“I do.”

“Then who do you think I’m talking about?”Madam Cen continued to ask.

Ye Zhuo lowered his voice. “Song Chenyu?”

“”Yes, yes, yes!”Madam Cen laughed out loud, “You really know me, Ye Zi!”! “The ugly fish I’m talking about is her!”! She’s really a clown who doesn’t know her place. She looks so ugly in clothes, and she thought she was so pretty! It’s fine if she’s pretty, but she’s so ugly, and she’s still pretending! The most interesting thing is that she actually claims to be the number one beauty in the entertainment industry!” ”

“In old Madam Cen’s view, song Chenyu couldn’t even compare to a strand of ye Zao’s hair. ”

She didn’t know where song Chenyu’s sense of superiority came from in front of ye Zao!

“Yet, CEN Yuyan still wanted to get involved. ”

She was like a fool.

“Old madam CEN continued, “Yezi, if only that stupid fourth brother was half as smart as you! Ugly fish was about to sell her, yet she was still counting the money for ugly fish! Thinking of my illustrious reputation, how could I have such a silly granddaughter!” ”

She was too silly!

“She was so silly that old lady cen couldn’t bear to look at her. It was better for her to take a look at her granddaughter-in-law, the most beautiful woman in the universe, to wash her eyes! ”

This private room was very big.

“There were all kinds of entertainment facilities in it. After sitting for a while, everyone became less reserved and began to move around. Some played billiards, and some began to play truth or Dare. ”

“Do you want to try that Dart?”Cen Shaoqing peeled an orange and handed it to Ye Zhuo.

“It’s a little sour.”Ye Zhuo tasted an orange and turned to look at the dart board not far away. “You mean that one?”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“It’s no big deal.”Ye Zhuo stood up and walked over.

Cen Shaoqing also stood up.

“This dart board was about five meters away from the dart board, and its height was 1.8 meters. ”

“On the ground, there were a bunch of darts that missed. ”

“If you wanted to hit the darts, not only did you have to find the right direction, but you also had to have strength. ”

“Otherwise, even if you threw the darts, the darts could not be stuck on the dartboard. ”

Ye Zao picked up a dart and was about to throw it.

Bang!

A dart flew out from the side.

It hit the Red Bull’s eye.

Someone had made a move before her.

Ye Zao looked up slightly and saw the gentle-looking song Chenyu.

That’s right.

This dart was thrown by song Chenyu.

“Song Chenyu smiled at Ye Zao. “Miss Ye, do you also like to play with darts?” ”

“”It’s average,”ye Zao said indifferently. ”

Average?

He probably couldn’t hit it at all?

Darts were not something that girls could play with.

Song Chenyu had also practiced darts for the sake of filming.

He did not expect it to come in handy today!

He even showed off his skills in front of Cen Shaoqing.

“Cen Yuyan walked over from the side and said with a smile, “You hit the bull’s-Eye! Chenyu, you’re so amazing!” ”

“Song Chenyu smiled at Cen Yuyan and said humbly, “I was just throwing it for fun. It’s not considered amazing. It can’t be compared to a professional.” ”

“CEN Yuyan continued, “You can hit the bull’s-eye just for fun. Isn’t that amazing? Then wouldn’t someone like me be called Trash?” ”

“Seeing this scene, the Cen old lady on the side frowned unhappily, “How can there be this ugly fish everywhere? Isn’t it just a Dart? What’s so great about it!”! ”

”

“Cen Yueying, who was at the side, smiled and said, “Grandma, I’ve seen it. The throwing distance of this club’s darts is much farther than the professional darts competition distance! Song Chenyu is a girl. It’s really not easy for her to hit the target in one shot.” ”

“Although Cen Yueying was a girl, she liked to watch darts competitions very much. She had also practiced in her spare time, but she was not as good as song Chenyu. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen snorted coldly. “Third girl, Yezi is your sister-in-law. Why are you always trying to influence others?”Old Mrs. Cen did not want Cen Yueying to praise song Chenyu! ”
