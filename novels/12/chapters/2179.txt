Li Man.

“After so many years, Li man actually appeared. ”

“Looking at the white-haired old man on the stage, Zhao Dan, who was in the plaintiff’s seat, was a little unsteady, and his breathing was a little hurried. ”

“Wasn’t Li Man already dead? Even they couldn’t find Li Man, so why would li man suddenly appear in the Intergalactic Court? ”

No.

This wasn’t the real Li Man.

“Back then, after Li Man sent the full moon away, the whole country sent people to silence her. They couldn’t reveal their dirty laundry. In order to prevent Li Man from trying to escape, they sent people to guard Li Man’s hometown for more than three months, in the following years, they had been paying close attention to Li Man, but there had been no news of Li Man. ”

“At this point, they were completely relieved. ”

“But now, she had actually become a witness on the stage, which Zhao Dan could not accept. ”

“Not only Zhao Dan, but even Man Jiangshan, who had always been calm, could not accept it. ”

“If this person was really Li Man, then everything would become a reality, and the charge of abandoning them would be established! ”

“For a moment, cold sweat broke out on man Jiangshan’s forehead. ”

The bullet screen was also somewhat interesting.

“”My God, if this woman is really Li Man, then this couple is too terrifying. A tiger does not eat its own son, but they even harmed their own daughter, so what qualifications do they have to be the parents of the people?” ”

“”I think everyone should not randomly pick sides for the time being. Just a second ago, we thought that Miss Ye was an unfilial daughter, but in the blink of an eye, things have turned out this way. Who knows if there will be other reversals later on?” ”

“[ yes, the analysis above is very reasonable. Perhaps this is a trap. From the perspective of parents, no parent would lay their hands on their own flesh and blood. ] ”

“[ from now on, I will stand by Miss Ye. ]. Regardless of whether the full moon princess was thrown away by man Jiangshan and Zhao Dan, the two different faces of the husband and wife were real. When they learned that miss ye was the female monarch of changyue, they shamelessly went to her door to acknowledge their daughter. They immediately changed their faces when Miss Ye had just taken the throne. Now that Miss Ye had become the future First Lady of the alliance, they had the same face again! Publicly announcing their relationship with Miss Ye on the Star Network. Looking at it from another perspective, if the full moon princess had not died, the person who would be blamed here would be the full moon Princess ”

“Damn! Thinking about it this way, man Jiangshan and his wife are indeed very scary ”

Maybe it was ye Zao who was scheming from the beginning to the end

“For a time, the internet was endlessly debating. ”

“Zhao Dan naturally knew that the current situation was very unfavorable for him. He raised his head and looked at the stage, then he said, “No! You’re Not Li Man! Comrade judge, she’s lying! This woman and ye Zao are working together to harm us! Since ye Zao can make a fake video, he can find a fake witness!” ”

Li Man was already dead.

“Even if ye Zao found someone who looked like Li Man, he would not be able to hide the truth. ”

“Ye Zao looked up slightly. “Mrs. Man kept saying that I wanted to harm you. May I ask, why would I want to harm you? If you had not come to me again and again, I would not have dug up such an old story.” ”

“In the beginning, Ye Zao also wanted to be able to recognize his biological parents and reunite with his family. ”

“However, ever since she found out that she was intentionally thrown away by the man Jiangshan couple, she had never thought about it again. ”

“The Man family had given her life. The Ye Zhuo from before was already dead, and they were even. ”

She was alone and beautiful.

“However, at this moment, the man family came after her. For the first time, Ye Zhuo’s design made the man family give up on this idea. However, when they found out that their daughter was still useful, they shamelessly chased after her, ye Zhuo had never seen such a shameless person. ”

“She knew very well that if the decision was made continuously, it would lead to chaos. If the entire family came after her again, there would only be more and more trouble in the future. ”

She had to cut the Gordian knot in one go and cut off all the trouble in the future.

Zhao Dan was also very regretful now.

“If she had known earlier, she would not have provoked such a trouble. ”

“But now, instead of eating the pork, he had provoked a whole lot of trouble. ”

“Zhao Dan narrowed his eyes, and a plan came to his mind, “It was you! It was you who caused the death of the full moon! You wanted to replace the full moon but couldn’t, so you were so ashamed that you killed her! In the end, you were afraid that your plot would be exposed, so you conspired with this woman to frame us! Ye Zao, you are really too vicious!” ”

Yes.

It must be like this.

“Ye Zao was about the same age as the full moon. After learning the true identity of the full moon, she plotted to kill the full moon. She wanted to replace the full moon to enjoy wealth and glory in the full star country. Therefore, after ye Zao took the throne, she wanted to go to the full star country. ”Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com
