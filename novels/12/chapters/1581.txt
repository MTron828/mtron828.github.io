“Chapter 1582: 239: it’s actually her, making things difficult in public. What can’t She Do? (there’s something else to talk about.)3”

Translator: 549690339

“Although Zhao Jiadong was a bit of a scumbag, he still knew his own limits. After saying that, he continued, “Don’t do those things that can’t be done in public. You’ll embarrass me!””

Who Was Cen Shaoqing?

“He was only thirty years old, but he was already known as CEN Fifth Master of the capital.”

Zeng Rou did not even have the right to serve him foot-washing water in front of him. Zeng Qiuwen was not dreaming. She was dreaming!

“Zeng Qiuwen rolled her eyes at him. “I know, I know!””

“”You can’t just know. You have to remember this for me!”Zhao Jiadong continued, “Don’t embarrass me!””

Zeng Qiuwen did not say anything else.

“Actually, she also knew that Zeng Rou was not good enough for Cen Shaoqing, but she still could not help but dream.”

“Soon, the two of them arrived at the front hall.”

“When did Shaoqing get here? Why didn’t you call me in advance so that I could arrange for someone to pick you up!”Zhao Jiadong walked to Cen Shaoqing’s side with a smile.

“Although Zhao Jiadong was an elder, standing in front of Cen Shaoqing, Zhao Jiadong did not feel like an elder at all.”

“Cen Shaoqing’s aura was too strong, so strong that Zhao Jiadong almost could not breathe.”

“”I have a chauffeur, there’s no need to trouble little uncle.”Cen Shaoqing’s tone was indifferent.”

“”We’re all family! How is this troublesome?”Zhao Jiadong’s gaze glanced at ye Zhuo who was beside Cen Shaoqing and continued, “This is?””

“Without waiting for Cen Shaoqing to speak, Bai Shu smiled and continued, “This is Shaoqing’s girlfriend, Ye Zhuo. Zhuo Zhuo, this is your little uncle, Zhao Jiadong.””

“Ye Zao greeted politely, “Hello, little uncle.””

“”Good, good, good!”Zhao Jiadong looked at ye Zao, his eyes filled with surprise, “Shaoqing! I didn’t expect little uncle to see you looking for a girlfriend in your lifetime! This is little uncle’s honor! Tonight, you must accompany little uncle for a few drinks!””

“Ye Zao was too beautiful. Zhao Jiadong boasted that he had seen countless women, both at home and abroad, but he had never seen someone like ye Zao.”

Zeng Qiuwen actually had the delusion of marrying Zeng Rou to Cen Shaoqing.

Zeng Rou did not even look at herself in the mirror to see how much she weighed.

Not even half. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Zeng Rou was probably not even one-thousandth of ye Zao.

“”You only know how to drink!”Bai Shu continued, “Oh right, Shaoqing, Zao Zao. Let me introduce you again. This is your little cousin, Zeng Qiuwen.””

Zhao Jiadong was already forty-nine and almost fifty years old.

“However, Zeng Qiuwen looked to be at most twenty-five or twenty-six years old. If Bai Shu had not introduced them, Ye Zhuoluo would have thought that they were father and daughter.”

“Looking at Zeng Qiuwen’s facial features and Zeng Rou’s, there were many similarities...”

Could it be that there was some connection between the two?

“Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly and turned to look at Bai Shu. “Auntie, isn’t my little cousin surnamed Du?””

Zhao Jiadong’s first wife was surnamed Du. She was a very gentle woman.

“Cen Shaoqing had long heard that Zhao Jiadong did not have a good style outside. However, he did not expect that Zhao Jiadong would be able to straighten out the woman outside so quickly.”

Although he was also a man.

“However, he looked down on men who were unfaithful to love the most.”

“If a man was unfaithful to the person next to him, what else could he do?”

“This...”Bai Shu’s eyes flashed with embarrassment.

“Zeng Qiuwen smiled to ease the awkwardness. “Mom, I’m about the same age as master five. You Don’t have to call me by my first name.””

“Bai Shu smiled and said, “Right, right, right. Just call me by my first name.””

“In fact, Bai Shu did not approve of Zhao Jiadong having an affair.”

But it had already happened. What else could she do?

Who asked her to have such a son!

She could not let her beat Zhao Jiadong to death!

“Moreover, Zeng Qiuwen was pregnant with the Zhao family’s child.”

“No matter what, she could not watch the Zhao family’s child wander outside.”

“Seeing this scene, ye Zao understood.”

So Zeng Qiuwen was a mistress.

No Wonder Xuan Xu was so big.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Aunt, Zao Zao and I still have to go to little aunt’s place to take a look, so we won’t disturb you anymore!””

“Bai Shu immediately followed Cen Shaoqing’s footsteps, “Shaoqing, then will you come for dinner tomorrow? Aunt is getting old, and I don’t know how many years I can live. In the future, I won’t be able to see her even once!””

“Looking at Bai Shu’s wrinkled face, ye Zhuozhuo couldn’t bear to see her, so he continued, “Aunt, don’t worry. We will definitely come for dinner tomorrow, and we will inform you in advance!””

“”Okay! Okay!”Bai Shu smiled and said, “Zao Zao, then it’s a deal!””

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“After leaving the Zhao family, Cen Shaoqing asked the driver to go back first. He drove ye Zao to Baizhi’s house.”
