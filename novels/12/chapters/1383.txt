“”It’s nothing. My father is a hot-tempered person. You know how he gets violent when he doesn’t get along with someone.”. “Speaking of which, Zhou Xiang paused and continued, “Mom, don’t worry. My father was very gentle. You Can’t see anything now.” ”

“”You’ve applied the medicine. If you hadn’t applied the medicine, you would still be swollen!”! “How could a biological father beat his own daughter like that?”Old Mrs. Cen frowned. “You’re the only one who’s so stupid to let them beat and scold you. Look at Jinbei and look at you. If you were half as sober as Jinbei, I wouldn’t have to worry so much about you.” ”

Zhou Jinbei was much more shrewd than Zhou Xiang.

“Up until now, Zhou Jinbei still refused to call Xie Wanqiu ‘mother’. ”

But Zhou Xiang had long changed her way of addressing Xie wanqiu.

“Zhou Xiang had a good heart, so she thought everyone was very kind. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “You haven’t told me why your father would hit you!” ”

“”Mom, didn’t I just say it? My father has a very bad temper. He would hit you if there was a disagreement. Actually, it’s nothing.” ” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Really?”Old Mrs. Cen asked.

“Of course it’s true. Why do you think they did it?”Zhou Xiang asked back.

She couldn’t tell old Mrs. Cen the real reason.

“If Old Mrs. Cen knew the truth, she would definitely not let it go. ”

“At that time, the matter would only get bigger and out of control. ”

“In this case, she still had room for redemption. ”

Old Mrs. Cen knew that Zhou Xiang had not told her the truth.

This child was too calculative.

“If it was anyone else, who could tolerate such parents? ”

But Zhou Xiang could!

“Not only could she, but she also spoke up for them everywhere. ”

“”Xiang Xiang,”old Mrs. Cen reached out and held Zhou Xiang’s hand. “Remember, no matter what happens, I will always be your strongest support. If you encounter any difficulties, you must tell me.” ”

“I know.”Zhou Xiang nodded.

“With that, old Mrs. Cen did not say anything else. “It’s getting late. You should go to bed early.” ”

“Zhou Xiang nodded. “Mom, you should go to bed early too.” ”

“I know.”

“In the blink of an eye, the next day arrived. ”

Zhou Jinbei came to Dr. William’s studio.

The car had just parked when old Zhang ran excitedly to Dr. William’s office. “Dr. William! Dr. William!”

Dr. William put down the document in his hand. “Zhou Jinbei is here?”

Dr. William gave him a thumbs up. “You’re really amazing! Zhou Jinbei is already in the parking lot.”

“Dr. William smiled and said, “Don’t make a fuss. As I said, as long as he sends a will to repair it, he must come and find me.”He was a top expert in C nation. ”

He had come to China this time to conquer everyone.

Professor William had already formulated a plan.

“First, he would possess all of Zhou Jinbei’s assets. Then, he would use Zhou Jinbei’s assets to create a country of technology that belonged to him. ”

“At that time, he would be standing at the top of the world of technology! ”

“As long as he thought of this, professor William’s eyes would be filled with light. ”

It was as if he had already dominated the country of technology.

“Old Zhang continued, “Professor, I’ll go outside to welcome Zhou Jinbei.” ”

“Go ahead.”Professor William waved his hand.

“Old Zhang came to the door of the studio. Just as he stepped out of the door, he saw Zhou Jinbei walk in. ”

“”Brother Zhou, you’re here.” ”

Zhou Jinbei looked at Old Zhang. “Brother Zhang.”

“”Come in, please.”Old Zhang gestured for him to come in. “I knew that you were filial. No matter what you did, you wouldn’t give up on repairing the will.” ”

“Zhou jinbei continued, “You’re on the same side as Dr. William. You approached me just to introduce me to Dr. William.” ”

“Old Zhang was not embarrassed. He smiled and said, “Brother Zhou is indeed a smart man. You’ve seen through it!” ”

So what if Zhou Jinbei had seen through it?

Would Zhou Jinbei give up on repairing the will?

Zhou Jinbei did not have any expression on his face. “I should have seen through it long ago.”

“From the very beginning, old Zhang’s motives had been very impure. ”

“He had been smart all his life, but he had been muddle-headed for a while. He foolishly confided in old Zhang and even called him brother. ”

“Old Zhang smiled and said, “Actually, it’s not too late to see through it now. Brother Zhou, don’t worry about why I approached you. You just need to know that Dr. William can help you repair your will.” ”

“After all, this was Zhou Jinbei’s ultimate goal. ”

The two of them walked and soon arrived at Dr. William’s office.

Old Zhang reached out and knocked on the door.

Dr. William’s voice came from inside. “Come in.”

“Old Zhang pushed the door open and entered. “Dr. William, Mr. Zhou has arrived.” ”

“Sit down.”Dr. William looked at the chair opposite him.

Zhou Jinbei leaned over and sat down.

Dr. William gave Old Zhang a look.

“Old Zhang immediately understood and took out the contract that he had prepared earlier. “Brother Zhou, take a look. This is the contract. If you feel that there’s no problem, sign it.” ”

“Zhou Jinbei looked at the contract, his eyes full of ridicule. ”

This old Zhang really treated him like a fool.

“The contract clearly stated that Dr. William only had a 50% chance of repairing the will. Once the contract was signed, the restoration plan would be immediately carried out for a total of two months. ”

“After two months, regardless of whether the will could be successfully repaired or not, all of Zhou Jinbei’s assets would belong to Professor William. ”

This contract was even more overbearing than the overbearing clause.

“Seeing that Zhou Jinbei held the contract and did not speak for a long time.., old Zhang continued, “Brother Zhou, all these years, you’ve flown to so many countries. You should know that currently, there’s no technology to repair it, but professor William has a 50% chance. Although the contract said that it was only 50% , actually, professor William has a 100% chance. It’s just that Professor William is low-key and doesn’t want to clearly mark it out.” ”

“Zhou jinbei sneered, “Then he’s really low-key.” ”

Only someone like old Zhang could say something like that.

“Old Zhang didn’t see Zhou Jinbei’s mockery and continued, “So, Brother Zhou, hurry up and sign it! After this mountain, there won’t be this temple anymore!” ”

“”Where’s my original copy?”Zhou Jinbei flipped through the contract, “You Lost It?” ”

“”Don’t worry, I didn’t lose it. It’s Here!”Old Zhang took out an envelope from his pocket. ”

“Zhou Jinbei took the envelope. After confirming that there was nothing wrong with the will, he stood up from his chair. “I still have something to do. Excuse me!” ”

“”Brother Zhou, you haven’t signed it yet!”Old Zhang stood up and said. ”

Zhou Jinbei turned to look at Old Zhang. “Who said I’m going to cooperate with you?”

Not cooperating?

“Old Zhang’s face was full of disbelief. “Brother Zhou, what do you mean? Don’t you want to fix the will and restore Auntie’s innocence?” ”

“Dr. William is the only one who can fix the will!”

“Zhou Jinbei looked at Old Zhang, “The only one? Dr. William is such a big face! Our China is a great country with many talents. There are many people who are more powerful than him. Only a frog at the bottom of a well with short-sighted vision would say such a ridiculous thing!” ”
