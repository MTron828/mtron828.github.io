Chapter 1922: 387: teaching people to behave

Translator: 549690339

Sandalwood incense burned in the air.

“Green smoke curled up, making the two of them look like celestial beings. ”

“”Old Lady, who are you?”Seeing Old Lady Li come in, Ye Zhuo put down the chess piece in his hand and looked back. ”

“Old Lady Li Smiled. “Miss Ye, right? I’m Yueyue’s grandmother.” ”

“Ye Zhuo had never been resistant to old people. He got down from the couch and said, “Old Lady, please take a seat.” ”

“Thank you.”Old Madam Li sat at the table.

“Ye Zao poured her a cup of tea. “Old Madam, I should be the one to visit you. Instead, I let you come to my place.” ”

Old Madam Li took the tea that ye Zao handed over and narrowed her eyes slightly.

She had thought that Miss Ye was very powerful!

“Now, it seemed that other than her face that could still be seen, she was completely useless! ”

“But thinking about it, she was a guest. To Ye Zhuo, she was now the one living under someone else’s roof. In front of her master, couldn’t she be a little disrespectful? ”

“Thinking of this, old madam Li became more confident. She raised her chin and looked at Ye Zhuo. “Miss Ye, to be honest, I came here to discuss something with you.” ”

“Please speak.”Ye Zhuo drank a mouthful of tea.

“Old madam Li continued, “Shuyi is my eldest granddaughter. That child is still young and has no rules in her actions. Miss Ye, why do you have to lower yourself to the level of a child?” ”

“Is being young a reason to be Shameless?”Ye Zao raised his eyes slightly.

“It was clearly a very simple sentence, but it was loud and clear. ”

Old Madam Li did not expect that ye Zao would suddenly throw a tantrum like a spring breeze a second ago. Old Madam Li’s heart trembled.

“No matter how bad Li Sanzhu said it, it was just that he did not know how to behave. Yet, ye Zao directly said that he did not know shame! ”

Wasn’t this saying a little bad?

“Old Madam Li tried her best to maintain the smile on her face, “Miss Ye, what you said is a little wrong. There are some things that can not be answered with one slap. If we did not receive any instructions, I think our Shuyi would not have rushed to CEN fifth master’s room.” ”

Perhaps fifth master Cen had sent Li Shuyi to his room.

“In this way, fifth master Cen would still have to be responsible for Li Shuyi! ”

PA!

“Ye Zhuo gently placed the cup on the table. His red lips parted slightly, and his clear and shallow tone carried a hint of coldness and awe. ”

“”I respect you as Yueyue’s grandmother, so I let you off a little. I didn’t expect you to take an inch and take a mile. You Don’t know what’s good for you. “With a shameless granddaughter like Li Shuyi, if it were someone else’s grandmother, she wouldn’t have the face to meet people. How are you, Old Lady? Not only are you not ashamed, you’re even proud of it!” ”

“Old Lady Li’s hand that was holding the cup of water was trembling. She looked at Ye Zhuo in disbelief, and her entire face turned pale. ”

She had never dreamed that ye Zhuo would speak like this!

Why did ye Zhuo not give her any face at all?

“”Old Madam, as a grandmother, you have to act like a grandmother,”ye Zhuo continued. “You have to set a good example for the younger generation! If the upper beam is not upright, the lower beam is crooked. Li Shuyi is the best example.” ”

“After saying that, Ye Zhuo looked outside the door and said in a clear and shallow tone, “Feng Yue, send the guest out.” ”

“Feng Yue walked in from outside. “Please, Old Madam!” ”

Old Madam Li was completely dumbfounded!

She had always been the Li family’s high and Mighty Old Madam. When had anyone ever dared to treat her like this. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Moreover, this was the Li family. How could ye Zhuo not give her any face at all. ”

“No matter what, she was someone who had lived half her life. ”

How Old Was Ye Zhuo?

Old Madam Li stood where she was and was unwilling to leave.

“Ye Zhuo stood up. “Old Madam Li, I’m giving you a way out, but you won’t budge. Then don’t blame me for not giving you any face.” ”

Old Madam Li was so frightened that her face turned pale. She immediately followed Feng Yue’s footsteps.

“All the way to the door, old madam Li’s legs were shaking. ”

Too Powerful!

Ye Zao was simply too powerful!

She originally thought that ye Zao was a soft persimmon. She did not expect that ye Zao would kill without spilling blood.

What should she do now?

“On this side, old madam Li had just left when Li Yueyue arrived. “Da Zao Zao, did my grandmother come to look for you just now? What did she tell you? Are You Alright?” ”

“I’m fine.”Ye Zhuozhu raised his eyebrows slightly. “But I don’t know if your grandmother is okay.”
