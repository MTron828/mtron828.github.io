“Ye Zhuo has such a brain?”Si lui turned to look at Zhao Xueyin. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Ye Zhuo was arrogant and conceited. If she had a brain, she wouldn’t have publicized the completion of the aircraft carrier plan within two years. ”

Today’s incident was really not ye Zhuo’s doing.

“Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes. “Big Brother Si, then what do you think happened today?” ”

“Elder Zhang.”Si lui slowly spat out two words.

“Elder Zhang?”Zhao Xueyin asked.

Si lui nodded. “Yes! Ye Zhuo is just a marionette. The one controlling him from behind is elder Zhang.”

Zhao Xueyin sighed. “Elder Zhang and my dad have never been on good terms. It’s not hard to understand why he did this.”

“Si lui patted Zhao Xueyin’s shoulder. “Xueyin, don’t think too much. Everything will be fine when it gets to the end. It’s just a marionette. You Don’t have to worry so much about it.”The rest of the way.., he would help Zhao Xueyin pave the way for the rest of the journey bit by bit. ”

“Zhao Xueyin looked at the lawyer. “Big Brother Si, it’s a good thing that you’re by my side. Otherwise, I wouldn’t know what to do.” ”

“”Don’t worry, I’ll always be by your side,”the lawyer said. ”

“Thank you.”Zhao Xueyin was moved as she hugged the lawyer.

The lawyer rubbed Zhao Xueyin’s head. “Silly Girl.”

“This ‘Silly Girl’made Zhao Xueyin wake up completely. She wanted to push the lawyer away, but she was afraid of hurting the lawyer, ”

what if she pushed the lawyer away and the lawyer couldn’t get over it?

“The lawyer liked her so much. If she pushed the lawyer away, the lawyer would definitely not get over it. ”

Their friendship would stop there.

No.

No.

She couldn’t push the lawyer away.

“But if she did not push the lawyer away, would the lawyer misunderstand something? ”

She still had to marry master five in the future!

“For a moment, Zhao Xueyin entered a dilemma. ”

She could only sigh in her heart.

“Fortunately, there was no third person who saw her. She could hug him. Since she could not be with the lawyer, she could use this hug to make up for the regret of not being able to be together. ”

“After a while, Zhao Xueyin let go of Si lui with a natural expression. “Big Brother Si, it’s getting late. I should go back.” ”

“Si lui said, “I’ll send you.” ”

“Zhao Xueyin couldn’t refuse Si lui, so she could only nod. “Then I’ll have to trouble you, Big Brother Si.” ”

“You don’t have to trouble me.”

Si lui drove Zhao Xueyin to the Zhao residence.

“Although Father Zhao wasn’t in the consortium, he knew everything that happened in the consortium during the day. ”

Zhao Xueyin had just walked into the living room when she saw Father Zhao sitting on the sofa with a dark face.

“Dad.”Zhao Xueyin walked over and called out.

“Father Zhao continued, “What happened during the day today?” ”

“I was careless.”Zhao Xueyin lowered her head.

Father Zhao picked up the Teacup on the table and smashed it onto the ground.

PA!

“What a disgrace! You actually lost to a little girl!”

It would have been fine if he had lost to someone else.

But Zhao Xueyin just had to be stepped on by Ye Zao.

“In the past, Father Zhao was always suppressed by the old man. ”

Who would have thought that it would be the next generation.

Zhao Xueyin let ye Zao suppress her again.

How could father Zhao Swallow this resentment?

“The Si lui hurriedly explained, “Uncle, you misunderstood! Xueyin didn’t lose to Ye Zao. It was elder Zhang who tricked us.” ”

“If it wasn’t for elder Zhang, what would ye Zao Be? ”

Ye Zao couldn’t even be considered as Zhao Xueyin’s pinky finger.

“Hearing this, Father Zhao narrowed his eyes. “What do you mean?” ”

“The lawyer continued, “Ye Zao doesn’t know anything about financial issues. He’s arrogant and conceited. Everything is under elder Zhang’s control!” ”

“Father Zhao slammed the table and stood up, he said angrily, “That old fellow, Zhang Yifeng! So many years have passed, and I thought he had settled down! I didn’t expect him to still be so unrepentant! Do you really think that you can turn things around just by bringing a little girl over? Dream On!” ”

“The lawyer picked up a glass of water and handed it to Father Zhao. “Uncle, anger hurts the liver. Please drink some water first.” ”

“Father Zhao took the glass of water from the lawyer, and the anger on his face dissipated a little. “We have to chase ye Zhuo out of the consortium immediately!” ”

“Zhao Xueyin frowned. “With Zhang Yifeng by her side, it might be a little difficult.” ”

“”Idiot!”Father Zhao looked at Zhao Xueyin. Women were women after all, with long hair and short knowledge. “That old thing Zhang Yifeng, can he still stay by her side at all times?” ”

...

On the other side.

Elder Zhang brought ye Zhuo to the ye residence.

“This residence had not been lived in for more than thirty years. However, because people often came to manage it, it did not look so bleak. ”

The residence still maintained the decorations from the 1960s and 1970s.
