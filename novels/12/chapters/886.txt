Translator: 549690339

Song Chenyu sent a hug emoji under song Yiwan’s comments.

“Song Yiwan’s fans had increased by more than two million because of this matter, and countless advertising endorsements came knocking on her door. In less than two days, she received a job offer that went soft on her.”

“The moment song Chenyu’s Weibo post was posted, it immediately went on the hot searches in less than three minutes.”

[ sob SOB SOB! I feel so bad for my sister. She didn’t even dare to make a sound when she was bullied. ]

“[ don’t be afraid, Chenyu! You still have us fans behind you! We will definitely fight against the evil forces to the end! ]”

[ I’m really going to be angered to death by that disgusting Internet celebrity! She hasn’t even shown her face since the incident. What kind of backing does she have? ]

[ please give us justice in exchange for Sunfish’s Justice! ]

[ a certain internet celebrity should get out of the entertainment industry! ]

“[ sunfish, we’re all waiting for you to sue her. She’s suspected of intentional murder! It’s best to let her rot in prison! ]”

[ we support Sunfish’s lawsuit! ]

[ it’s best to sue the program team as well. ]

“After seeing song Chenyu post on Weibo, Ye Zhuo slowly edited a Weibo post.”

“Today, he had to eat melon properly: [ after waiting for such a long time, Miss song finally responded. Since miss song claims that she doesn’t remember what happened, then I’ll help you recall it. [ video ][ photo JPG ]@song Chenyu V,@song Yiwan v. ]”

The video was not long for a total of five minutes.

The picture was an explanation of the ‘standard sentencing for libel cases’.

“The moment this Weibo post was posted, it immediately attracted the attention of the entire Internet, and the hot searches immediately followed.”

[ song Yiwan is so F * * King Disgusting! ]

[ I support leaf in suing song Chenyu and song Yiwan! ]

[ the person above is outstanding! ]

“[ I didn’t expect the waters in the entertainment industry to be so deep! They even created a palace drama! If Ye Zi didn’t have this video, wouldn’t he be exposed online? ]”

[ to think that I trusted song Yiwan and song Chenyu so much. These two are simply a pair of vicious sisters! ]

“[ wow, that’s so disgusting! I was feeling sorry for Song Chenyu just now! ]”

[ this reversal is really unexpected! ]

“[ actually, leaf is really quite kind. She didn’t release this video before. She probably wanted to give song Chenyu a chance and wait for song Chenyu to come out and clarify himself. She didn’t expect song Chenyu to actually bite back and push all the blame onto her. ]”

“Very quickly, the words ‘song Chenyu, song Yiwan, get out of the entertainment industry’appeared on the hot searches.”

The Weibo trending topics were instantly occupied by song Chenyu and song Yiwan.

“When song Yiwan saw these trending topics, she was so scared that her face turned pale.”

Where did ye Zhuo get the video?

And the angle was so clear.

What should she do now?

Song Yiwan was panicking. She didn’t know what to do. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Public opinion could lift up a person, but it could also destroy a person.”

“The next second, song Yiwan received a call from her manager. “Song Yiwan, what are you doing? Do you know that you’re in Big Trouble? Come to the company right now!””

“”Okay, I, I’ll be there right away.”At this moment, song Yiwan’s lips were trembling.”

“Song Chenyu was awakened by the sound of an emergency electric arc. He picked up the phone. “Hello, brother Tao, what’s the matter?””

“Trending? What’s wrong with Trending?”

“Song Chenyu had thought that it was a trending search about ye Zao. With her response, did ye Zao Want to turn things around?”

It was simply wishful thinking.

Song Chenyu clicked on the hot search page and saw the hot search page and ye Zao’s response and video. She was dumbfounded. The cold sweat on her forehead almost appeared in an instant. She even thought that she was hallucinating.

It was not until she clicked on the video that song Chenyu realized that it was not an illusion.

“”Brother Tao, what should I do now?””
