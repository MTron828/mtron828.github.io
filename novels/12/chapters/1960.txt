Translator: 549690339

“Mi Chen did not answer father he directly. Instead, she said, “Mr. HE, there is a medical term called miracle. I believe that Ziteng will definitely create a miracle.” ”

Create a miracle?

How could that be possible!

Unless the sun came out from the west.

“If not, he ziteng would never be able to create a miracle. ”

He had seen it just now.

“He ziteng’s liver, liver, spleen, and lungs were all severely injured. At the same time, there was also a very serious internal bleeding. ”

“If he ziteng did not die, he would only be a paralyzed vegetable on the bed forever. ”

“Hearing this, father he smiled and said, “Then I’ll rely on your good words, doctor Mi!” ”

“Old Mr. He is too polite.”

“Hearing what Mi Chen said, he ziteng was also full of confidence in himself. ”

He felt that he would definitely wake up.

“After all, he was now very clear-headed. ”

“How many people could be like him, lying in bed after such a serious car accident and still maintaining such a clear-headed state of mind. ”

A miracle!

They were waiting for him!

“The next second, Xu Yao walked in from outside. ”

“Uncle.”

“Father he turned to look at Xu Yao and said, “Yaoyao, let me introduce you to doctor Mi Chen.” ”

“Xu Yao said, “Uncle, there’s no need to introduce him. I know Doctor Mi.” ”

“How did you two meet?”Father he asked in surprise.

“Xu Yao smiled and said, “Doctor Mi was the one who bandaged my hand previously. Moreover, Ziteng and doctor mi are very good friends. Doctor mi often goes to the house with Ziteng as a guest!” ”

“Is that so?”Father he asked.

“”Yes.”Xu Yao nodded and continued, “Where’s Auntie?” ”

“Father he continued, “She has something to do when she goes back. I have to go back in a while too. I’ll have to trouble you to take care of Ziteng here.” ”

“”It’s not hard,”Xu Yao said gently. “I’m Ziteng’s girlfriend. It’s my responsibility to take care of ziteng.” ”

Father he glanced at Xu Yao and was very grateful to her.

“During this period of time, it was all thanks to Xu Yao taking care of He ziteng. ”

“It could be seen that when Xu Yao took care of He ziteng, she was more responsible than their parents. ”

Xu Yao would definitely be a good wife and daughter-in-law in the future.

Mi Chen began to apply medicine to he ziteng.

“”Xu Yao, come over and help,”mi Chen said. ”

“Okay.”Xu Yao immediately went over.

“Father he looked at the time. It was almost time. He continued, “Yaoyao, doctor mi, I’ll be out for a while. I’ll be back soon.” ”

Xu Yao nodded. “You can go and do your work.”

Father he walked out of the ward.

The ward returned to silence.

The two of them spoke.

“After a while, Xu Yao went to lock the door of the ward. She walked behind Mi Chen and said in a low voice, “Do you know that I Miss You?” ”

“”Me too,”Mi Chen replied. ”

“Both of their voices were very soft. Although he ziteng was still conscious, his eyes were closed. He couldn’t tell what they were doing. He also didn’t expect that his trusted doctor mi.., had already gotten together with her girlfriend. ”

“A moment later, the sound of a kiss seemed to come from the air. ”

Did he hear it wrong?

He ziteng was a little suspicious of his ears.

He must have heard it wrong! VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

There was no one else in the room other than Xu Yao and Mi Chen. How could there be the sound of a Kiss?

He must have heard it wrong!

“”Yaoyao, do you love me?”At this moment, Mi Chen suddenly said. ”

“At this moment, he ziteng thought he was hearing things. ”

Was this really Mi Chen’s voice?

“”Are you crazy?”Xu Yao whispered, “Aren’t you afraid that he ziteng will hear you?” ”

“Seeing how careful she was, he ziteng smiled and said, “Don’t worry. He ziteng will forever be a cripple. No matter what we do, he won’t be able to hear us.” ”

“Are you sure?”Xu Yao asked tentatively.

“Of course.”

“That’s good.”Xu Yao heaved a sigh of relief. She was really afraid that he ziteng would hear them.

“Seeing her like this, Mi Chen smiled and said, “Baby, what are you afraid of? So what if he can hear us? Can he still get up?” ”

“Xu Yao continued, “How are he ziteng’s injuries? Can they still be healed?” ”

“Mi Chen curled her lips and hugged Xu Yao as she sat down by the bed. “Baby, don’t worry. He ziteng is destined to be a cripple for the rest of his life!” ”

“Really?”Xu Yao asked.

“You don’t believe me?”Mi Chen reached out to pick up Xu Yao’s lower body and kissed it.

He ziteng was completely dumbfounded.

He didn’t know what was going on with him.

How could he have heard such words!

Did he really not hear wrongly?

What was going on between Mi Chen and Xu Yao?

When did the two of them get together?

“Hearing the ambiguous voices in the air, he ziteng wanted nothing more than to wake up immediately and personally tear the faces of this adulterous couple apart. ”

Never in his wildest dreams did he expect that his most beloved girlfriend and his most trusted brother would betray him.

Why on Earth was this?

How did things turn out like this?

He could hardly believe that this was real.

But the voices in his ears kept reminding him that this was real!

This was real!

“After an unknown amount of time, the two people who were entangled with each other finally let go of each other. ”

“Xu Yao’s face was very red. “Oh right, Mi Chen, there’s one more thing.” ”

“”Speak,”Mi Chen said. ”

“Xu Yao continued, “I heard from the He family’s parents that there’s a Miss ye who has exceptional medical skills that might be able to cure he ziteng. What do you think we should do if that ye guy really cures he ziteng?” ”

Cure Him?

How could that be possible!

“Upon hearing this, Mi Chen laughed out loud. ”

“What are you laughing at?”Xu Yao asked.

Mi Chen reached out and hugged Xu Yao’s arm. “I’m laughing at how naive you are!”

Xu Yao frowned.

“Mi Chen continued, “Let me put it this way. In a situation like he ziteng’s, even if Hua Tuo were alive, he wouldn’t be able to cure him! Not to mention, he’s just an amateur!” ”

What Miss Ye? He had never even heard of her. How could she possibly cure he ziteng?

It was impossible!

“Mi Chen was also an excellent doctor. Hearing what Mi Chen said, Xu Yao immediately heaved a sigh of relief. ”

“Mi Chen hugged Xu Yao and kissed her. “Don’t worry. After I get rid of those two old men, no one will be able to disturb our private time!” ”

What!

Mi Chen wanted to make a move on her parents.

“When he heard this, he ziteng became anxious. ”

No.

Absolutely not.

He had already become like this. His parents couldn’t have any more accidents.

“When she heard this, Xu Yao’s face turned pale. “You still want to make a move? !” ”

Still want?

Why did Xu Yao say that she still wanted to make a move?

Could it be.

His car accident...

Was also man-made.

Or could it be that Mi Chen and Xu Yao were the ones who caused his car accident?

He ziteng’s heart chilled to the extreme.

He had never known that he had two ingrates by his side.

“”Don’t worry, not now,”mi chen continued, “We’ll carry out this plan after the bastard child in your stomach is born.” ”

“After the child in Xu Yao’s stomach was born, the He family would definitely carry out the plan wantonly. ”

“At that time, once the two old men in the He family were in trouble, Xu Yao and the child would become the only heirs. ”

Mi Chen had planned everything out.

“Xu Yao was not very brave. Ever since he ziteng’s accident, she had been worried that the police would find out something, she held Mi Chen’s arm and said, “Take it easy. He ziteng’s matter isn’t over yet! What if the police find out something? “Oh right, did you clean up the traffic recorder when you tampered with the car?” ”

“”Don’t worry, you don’t have to remind me of that.”Mi Chen continued, “If the police had really found something, I wouldn’t be standing here and talking to you.” ”

“Xu Yao continued, “No matter what, you have to be careful. After all, you are involved in this matter. If the police found out, you would be finished!” ”

“Mi Chen did not take these words to heart. She smiled and said, “Baby, are you concerned about me?” ”

“Nonsense!”Xu Yao said.

He ziteng listened to every single word.

It really was!

It was really them.

“The original name of the brake failure was not an accident, but a premeditated plan. ”

When did this pair of dog and woman get together?

Why didn’t he feel anything at all!

He ziteng was very angry now. He wanted to get out of bed immediately and kill this pair of dog lovers.

“But now, he could do nothing. ”

He couldn’t even move a finger.

He ziteng started to panic.

He was really panicking!

“If he continued like this, what would his parents do? ”

His parents were still kept in the dark by Xu Yao!

He had let his parents down. He should have listened to their advice at that time. He should not have continued to listen to their opinions.

He ziteng wanted to kneel in front of his parents and repent.

“After an unknown amount of time, he ziteng’s consciousness became blurry and clear again. Finally, he heard his parents’voices. ”

“”Yaoyao, it’s been hard on you to take care of ziteng for one day. This is the chicken soup that I specially asked the chef at home to make for you.” ”

“Xu Yao said gently, “Thank you, Auntie. It’s not hard at all for me. Please sit down.” ”

“Mother he looked around and continued, “Where’s doctor Mi?” ”
