“No matter what, Bai Mo did not want to go to Earth. ”

“In Bai Mo’s eyes, Earth was a low-grade planet. ”

“Not only was the environment dirty and messy, but people were also low-grade people! ”

They were just a group of low-grade people. What right did they have to stand with her? Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

She looked down on the people of Earth from the bottom of her heart.

“If Lin Ze had not become the heir of the Shangguan family in one leap, she would not have sided with Lin Ze. ”

“Bai Mo continued, “Yuanyuan, there’s no need to go to Earth, right? I think Galaxy F is pretty good. Lin Ze will go to Galaxy F in the future anyway.” ”

“”No.”Bai Yuanyuan shook her head and said firmly, “You have to go to Earth First.” ”

“”Why?”Bai Mo looked at Bai Yuanyuan, puzzled. ”

What reason did she have to go to earth?

“Bai Yuanyuan narrowed her eyes and continued, “Earth is Lin Ze’s home planet. He has special feelings for Earth. Do you know why he could accept Bai Jingshu so quickly?” ”

“”Because Bai Jingshu is my substitute,”Bai Mo said. ”

Bai Mo was very confident about this.

“If Bai Jingshu was not her cousin, Lin Ze would not have taken over Bai Jingshu. ”

Poor Bai Jingshu thought that Lin Ze loved her so much.

“Thinking of this, Bai Mo’s eyes were filled with ridicule. ”

She would be able to let Bai Jingshu see the reality soon.

“Hearing this, Bai Yuanyuan shook her head. “No, it’s not just that.” ”

“Although Bai Jingshu was Bai Mo’s cousin, that was not the main reason. ”

“Then what else is there?”Bai Mo asked curiously.

“Bai Yuanyuan analyzed, “Because Bai Jingshu likes Earth. Her love for Earth almost surpasses that of the s galaxy.” ”

“Bai Jingshu was a fanatic fan of earth. Not only did she like Earth, but she also loved Earth’s ancient culture. ”

“Before Lin Ze, everyone in the S Galaxy had mocked Bai Jingshu for being mentally ill. ”

“But now, who dared to mock Bai Jingshu like that? ”

“If Bai Jingshu had not gone to earth, she would not have gotten to know Lin Ze, much less be together with him. ”

“”Momo, if you want to win Lin Ze back, you have to do what he wants! You’re the person he likes to begin with. As long as you take the initiative a little and let him see how good you are, you’ll make him really want you!”Relationships had to go both ways, lin Ze had already taken the initiative. Now was the time for Bai Jingshu to take the initiative. ”

“Lin Ze was originally from Earth. Naturally, he did not like people to belittle his planet. ”

What he needed was praise. Someone could discover the beauty of Earth.

“It was at this moment that Bai Jingshu appeared. Not only did Bai Jingshu like Earth, but she also understood earth. Most importantly, she was Bai Mo’s cousin. They were both girls from the Bai family. There were many similarities between them. If not.., lin Ze would definitely not have chosen Bai Jingshu. ”

“Hearing this, Bai Mo nodded. ”

She felt that what Bai Yuanyuan said made a lot of sense.

The reason why Bai Jingshu was so lucky to be Lin Ze’s wife was also because she had always liked Earth’s culture.

“”So, Momo, you have to go to Earth this time,”Bai Yuanyuan looked at Bai Mo and said very seriously. ”

“Okay.”Bai Mo nodded. “I understand.”

“Bai Yuanyuan added, “Not only do you have to go, but you also have to understand Earth and love it. Let Lin Ze see that Bai Jingshu isn’t the only one who likes Earth in the S Galaxy.” ”

“In the current s galaxy, other than Bai Jingshu, there was no one else who loved Earth’s culture as much as Bai Jingshu. ”

Bai Jingshu needed a strong competitor.

Lin Ze also needed to see other girls who were more outstanding than Bai Jingshu.

“Bai Mo narrowed her eyes and continued, “Yuanyuan, you’re right! Then I’ll make some preparations. We’ll set off in the next few days.” ”

“”Okay.”Bai Yuanyuan continued, “Momo, if you’re Rich, you mustn’t forget me.” ”

“”Don’t worry.”Bai Mo smiled and said, “I won’t forget anyone.” ”

Bai Yuanyuan was simply a guiding light on her path in life.

“If she married Lin ze successfully, she would definitely pull Bai Yuanyuan up as well. There were so many powerful people in Galaxy F. if she were to introduce any one of them to Bai Yuanyuan, she would become a top-notch noblewoman in the future. ”

“With Bai Yuanyuan as a military advisor, they could support each other in Galaxy S and share the glory together! ”

“Thinking of this, Bai Mo was a little excited. It was as if she could already see the future. ”

“Hearing Bai Mo’s promise, Bai Yuanyuan smiled and said, “Mo Mo, thank you!” ”

“”We are good sisters,”Bai Mo said. “You helped me. I will definitely not mistreat you.” ”
