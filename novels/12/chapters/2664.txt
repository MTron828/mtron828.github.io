A newborn child received a long-life lock prepared by an octogenarian. This was also a kind of beautiful blessing.

“”This is what I should do,”old Mrs. Cen said with a smile. “It’s just a small lock. Oh right, Ah Shu, why didn’t I see your mother?””

“On a day like today, ye Langhua should not be absent.”

“Ye Shu said, “My mother went to country L a month ago. She’s already on her way back.”” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Ye Langhua had worked hard for half of her life before she finally found her biological daughter. It was also time for her to enjoy herself, so ye Shu had arranged a lot of travel plans for her.”

“I see.”Old Mrs. Cen nodded.

“At this moment, there was a knock on the door again.”

Du Du du.

“I’ll go and open the door.”Ye Zhuo jogged over to open the door.

“I’ll go.”Lin Ze ran over to open the door before ye Zhuo.

“Ah Ze!”

“Outside the door were Xia Xiaoman and Lin Qingxuan, as well as Xiao Lin Zhi and an Lizi’s family of four.”

“Fourth uncle and fourth aunt.”Lin Ze greeted them politely.

“Xia Xiaoman asked a little excitedly, “AH ze, what did Jingshu give birth to?””

“Xiao Lin Zhi said, “Eleventh sister-in-law, can you give birth to a little Teddy for me?”He had wanted a little teddy for a long time, but unfortunately, Xia Xiaoman had never let him take care of it.”

“Hearing this, Xia Xiaoman immediately said, “What nonsense are you talking about, child? Of course, your sister-in-law gave birth to a little nephew for you! What little Teddy!””

“”OH.”Xiao Lin nodded, not fully understanding.”

“Xia Xiaoman looked at Lin Ze and said a little embarrassedly, “Ah Ze, I’m sorry. A child is not sensible.””

“Xiao Lin also apologized, “Brother Eleven, I’m sorry.””

“Lin Ze bent down and picked up little Lin Zhi. He smiled and said, “It’s okay, it’s okay. A child’s words are fearless.”After saying that, Lin Ze turned to look at Xia Xiaoman and the others, then, he said, “Fourth uncle, fourth aunt, Sister Lizi, come in quickly. My parents are inside.””

“”Okay, okay, okay.””

The few of them followed him in.

“”Dad, Mom, fourth uncle, fourth aunt, and the others are here,”Lin ze said.”

“Xia Xiaoman walked directly to the bed. “Oh my God, this doesn’t look like a newborn baby. How much did this baby weigh?””

“”Eight pounds, three ounces,”Bai Jingshu said.”

Xia Xiaoman smiled. “No wonder! Our Ah Zhi seemed to weigh only a little more than five pounds at that time.”

Bai Jingshu smiled. “The doctor also said that children weighing more than eight pounds are rare.”

“Xia Xiaoman continued, “Jingshu, thank you for your hard work. It’s not easy for a child that weighs more than eight pounds to give birth naturally.””

“Bai Jingshu said, “Actually, it’s not that bad. I didn’t feel much pain when I gave birth, but it was a little unbearable when I sewed it up. Fortunately, it was only for a short while.””

“Xia Xiaoman picked up the child and continued, “Little baby, you must be filial to your mother in the future!””

“This was also the first time that Xiao Lin Zhi had seen a child younger than him. He stood on his tiptoes curiously and said, “Mommy, Mommy, is this little brother or little sister?””

“Xia Xiaoman said casually, “Little brother.””

“After saying that, she suddenly remembered something and said with a smile, “What little brother? This is your little nephew. He’s going to call you little uncle. You Can’t call him that blindly.””

“Although Little Lin Zhi was young, his seniority in the Lin family was not low. After all, he was of the same seniority as Lin Ze.”

“When he heard this, little lin zhi said, “No, I’m not an uncle! I’m a little brother.””

“As he said this, he pointed at Lin Jin Cheng and said, “Little uncle already has a beard. I don’t even have one.””

“He was young, so when he said these words, his childish voice made the adults in the room burst into laughter.”

Xia Xiaoman squatted down and explained everything to Xiao Lin Zhi.

“However, Xiao Lin Zhi was only a four-year-old child after all. How could he know so much? “Anyway, I’m not a little uncle!””

Xia Xiaoman was a little helpless.

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “Xiaoman, it’s just a child. It’s okay to call him anything. Anyway, he’ll know when he grows up.””

Xia Xiaoman nodded. “That’s all we can do.”

Bai Jingshu looked at Little Lin Zhi and smiled as well. “Our Ah Zhi is already an uncle at such a young age.”

“Little Lin Zhi said, “Eleventh sister-in-law, I’m not an uncle. I’m still a child!””

“At this moment, Ye Zhuo squatted down and looked at little Lin Zhi. “Ah Zhi, age and seniority are different. Do you know what little baby will call me and Big Sister?””

Xiao Lin Zhi shook his head. “He will call sister and aunt. He will call me aunt.”

“Why not sister?”Xiao Lin Zhi tilted his head and asked.

“Ye Zhuo said, “Seniority is the same as seniority. Me, sister, and you, including your eleventh brother and eleventh sister-in-law, are all on the same level. The newborn baby is one level lower than us, so he has to call you uncle and call us aunt.””
