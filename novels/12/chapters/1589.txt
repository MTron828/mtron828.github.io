“Chapter 1590: 239: directly beating them up, too late for regrets! 5”

“Zhao youling snorted coldly, “Is it me who speaks harshly, or are you the one who does things unsightly?””

“As she finished speaking, Zhao youling sized up Zeng Qiuwen and Zeng Rou, then, she said, “Some people have climbed up a high branch by using unpresentable means, yet they still want to attain enlightenment by themselves. Even if a chicken or a dog rises to heaven, she doesn’t even take a look at whether this dog has the qualifications!””

Zhao youling’s words almost pointed at Zeng Rou’s nose and scolded her.

Zeng Rou’s entire body was trembling.

“Zeng Qiuwen was so angry that her face had turned pale. However, she had no choice but to lower her head under the eaves.”

“Zhao Jiadong frowned and said, “Sister, Qiuwen is pregnant now! Can’t you say less?””

“Then can’t she do two things that are not proper?”Zhao youling asked back.

Zhao youling disliked Zeng Qiuwen very much.

“Du Yingying had been married to the Zhao family for twenty years. Other than not giving birth to a child for the Zhao family, she had done a lot of hard work for the Zhao family. Without du Yingying back then, how could the current Zhao family exist?”

“Zhao Jiadong, on the other hand, had gotten together with this vixen in the blink of an eye. They did not even talk about the relationship between husband and wife.” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“”This has nothing to do with Qiuwen! Fine, I won’t tell you anymore!”Zhao Jiadong turned to look at Zeng Rou. “What are you standing there for? Get lost!””

Zeng Rou ran away crying.

“At this moment, Zeng Qiuwen clutched her stomach. “It hurts! It hurts! Jiadong! My stomach isn’t feeling well!””

“”Qiuwen, are you okay?”Zeng Qiuwen was pregnant with his only child. Zhao Jiadong was very nervous. He immediately carried Zeng Qiuwen and hurried to the bedroom. Before he left, he turned to look at Zhao youling, “SIS, if anything happens to the child in Qiuwen’s belly today, I’m not done with you!””

“Zhao youling snorted. “What a vicious dog! Even if such a person gives birth to a son, he is still a Prodigal!””

“On this side, Zeng Rou had just returned to her room when the Zhao family’s butler came over. “Miss Zeng, you have half an hour to pack your things and leave this place!””

Leave?

Zeng Qiuwen actually asked her to leave?

She thought that everything would be fine after she returned to her room!

She did not expect the butler to chase her away.

“”Where’s my sister! I want to see my sister!”Since she had come to this rich and noble place, how could Zeng Rou Bear to leave?”

“”Third mistress doesn’t have time to see you! However, she did ask me to pass on a message to you. She Won’t be coming here anymore. She doesn’t have a sister like you.””

Zeng Qiuwen was a person who knew what was going on.

“After this incident, Zeng Rou no longer had a place in the Zhao family. Even if she used the child in her stomach to forcefully keep Zeng Rou here, it would only be a disgrace.”

“Therefore, Zeng Rou had to.”

“Hearing this, Zeng Rou’s face instantly turned from pale to pale.”

No.

She couldn’t leave.

“Seeing her like this, the Butler looked at his watch and continued, “Miss Zeng, you still have 28 minutes left. If you don’t pack your things and leave within 28 minutes, don’t blame us for being rude.””

“”You, you dare!””

“The Butler smiled. “Then Miss Zeng, let’s see if we dare.””

Zeng Rou knew that the butler would not dare to do anything to her.

“After all, she was the third wife’s cousin, and the Butler was just a servant. As a servant, how could he dare to be rude to his master?”

Zeng Rou sat on the stool. She wanted to see what the butler could do to her if she did not leave!

Half an hour later.

“The butler spoke again, “Since Miss Zeng is not cooperating, we can only force you to leave. Guards!””

Zeng Rou looked up at the butler with her eyes wide open.

“As soon as the Butler finished speaking, someone walked in from outside, “Butler.””

“Drag this woman out!”

“Yes!”

“”I’ll see who Dares!”Zeng Rou stood up from the stool and said angrily, “I’m the biological cousin of the third mistress of the Zhao family!””

“Unexpectedly, the three bodyguards did not seem to hear Zeng Rou’s words. One on the left and the other on the right, they directly lifted Zeng Rou up.”

“”Let go of me! Sister! Brother-in-law, save me!”Zeng rou shouted desperately, but she did not call Zeng Qiuwen over. Instead, she attracted a bunch of servants who were watching the show.”

“Serves her right!”

“Retribution!”

“”Seeing how arrogant she usually is, I thought she could become one of the masters of this courtyard. I didn’t expect retribution to come so quickly!””

“Although Zeng Rou was not a proper relative of the Zhao family, she usually put on airs to her servants, which was even bigger than a proper owner.”

That was because the servants of the Zhao family did not like her very much.

Soon.

Zeng Rou was thrown outside the Zhao family’s villa.
