Chapter 148: 084: Retribution for evil. Lin Ze has come to yunjing! 7

Unfortunately, he was not some overbearing CEO and had never had a one-night stand with anyone.

Lin Ze followed ye Sen and arrived at the small restaurant.

Ye Sen ordered a bottle of white wine for himself and a glass of fruit juice for Lin Ze. “You’re just a child. It’s the time for you to grow up. You Can’t drink wine recklessly.”

“OH.”Lin Ze nodded.

No one had ever said that to him since he was young. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Grandma was old, and she had nothing else to say other than asking him to accept Feng Qianhua.

His father was always in the hospital or in the office.

After the dishes were served, ye Sen poured himself a glass of wine. “Can you tell uncle why you’re Crying?”

Lin Ze took a SIP of the juice and tried his best to suppress the bitterness in his heart. “I, I...”I tried for a long time, but in the end, I still couldn’t say it.

“It’s okay if you don’t want to say it. Let’s eat.”Ye Sen picked up a drumstick for Lin Ze with his chopsticks.

Looking at the drumstick in the bowl, Lin Ze said in a hoarse voice, “I can’t find my mother...”

He was only a nineteen-year-old boy after all.

No matter how strong and invincible he was, he was still a teenager.

But he also had a weak side.

“Don’t Cry, Don’t Cry!”Ye Sen was shocked and quickly stood up to wipe Lin Ze’s tears. “Did you get separated from your mother?”

Lin Ze shook his head.

“Did your father divorce your mother?”

Lin Ze still shook his head.

“Then what happened?”

Lin Ze took a deep breath and took a sip of juice, “I was brought up by my grandmother. I haven’t seen my mother since I was young. My grandmother said my mother is dead, but I didn’t believe it! She Can’t be dead! She must still be alive!”

He hadn’t even had the chance to see her.

How could she be dead? !

Ye Sen roughly understood what had happened and patted Lin Ze’s shoulder. “Don’t cry. As long as you’re sure that she’s still alive, you’ll find her one day! Right, do your grandmother and the others know that you came out to look for your mother?”

Lin Ze shook his head. “I told them that I went to sea city for a vacation. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have let me come.”

The term ‘mother’was like a forbidden word in the Lin family.

No one could mention it.

Ye Sen sighed. “Little brother, What’s Your Name? How about this, leave me your phone number. I’m a native of Yunjing. If I hear from your mother, I’ll give you a call.”

Lin Ze gave his cell phone number. “My Name Is Lin Ze. I’m Shuangmu Lin. I’m Chuan Ze.”

Lin Ze?

Ye Sen looked up at Lin Ze and continued, “My name is ye Sen. Ye of Ye, Lin Lin. You can call me Uncle Ye.”

...

At the same time, in Beijing.

Feng Qianhua stood on the balcony to answer the phone.

Suddenly, her expression changed. “What did you say? Yun Jing! He went to Yun Jing!”

If Lin Ze went to Yun Jing, then those secrets would not be able to be hidden anymore!

Feng Qianhua’s heart was in an unprecedented panic.

Could it be that her eighteen years of hard work had gone down the drain just like that?

No!

She was unwilling!

“Don’t be anxious. Lin Ze doesn’t have any clues now. He won’t be able to find ye Shu,”the person continued. “Our top priority is to get the Lin family to quickly call Lin ze back! If he continues like this, something bad will happen sooner or later!”

“I got it.”Feng Qianhua hung up the phone and went to the Lin family.

“Aunt Lin! Something Bad Happened!”

“What’s wrong? Why Are You So Anxious?”Old Mrs. Lin put down the ginseng soup in her hand.

Feng Qianhua continued, “Xianxian’s classmate told Xianxian just now that Ze didn’t go to sea city at all. Aunt Lin, are you sure ze went to sea city?”

Old Mrs. Lin nodded. “That’s what he told me!”

“Did something happen on the way?”Old Mrs. Lin frowned. “Where’s the Butler? Butler, quickly check young master’s whereabouts!”

The Butler immediately sent people to investigate.

After a while, they found Lin Ze’s whereabouts. The Butler’s expression was a little strange. “Old Lady, Young, young master, he, he...”

“What happened to him?”Old Lady Lin asked impatiently.

The butler continued, “He went to Yun Jing!”

Yun Jing!

Old Lady Lin was stunned on the spot.

What was Lin ze going to Yun Jing for?

Was he going to look for ye Shu!

This heartless child.

She had pulled him up so much, yet he went to look for that fickle woman, Ye Shu, without even saying a word.

Did he still have a grandmother in his heart?

“Evil creature! Evil creature!”Old Mrs. Lin slammed the table and stood up in anger.

“Aunt Lin, don’t be angry.”Feng Qianhua quickly stood up and supported Old Mrs. Lin. “Ah Ze is just a child. What can he know? Or, he’s just going to Yunjing to play.”

Old Mrs. Lin did not answer Feng Qianhua directly. Instead, she said to the butler, “Immediately arrange for someone to bring that evil creature back from Yunjing!”

“Yes, Old Mrs. Lin.”The housekeeper immediately made the arrangements.

Looking at the housekeeper’s back, Old Mrs. Lin sat back on the chair and could not help but cough loudly.

Feng Qianhua calmed old Mrs. Lin down. “Aunt Lin, perhaps ah ze just misses his mother. You must not be angry.”

“That fickle woman, is she worthy of being Ah Ze’s mother?”Old Mrs. Lin could not contain her anger, “Back then, he was only this little, like a cat! I worked hard to raise him up. If it wasn’t for me, would he still be alive today?”

Thinking about those past events, old Mrs. Lin was extremely angry.

She was angry at Lin Ze for not being sensible.

She was angry at ye Shu for being promiscuous.

Feng Qianhua continued, “Ah Ze is still young now. When he grows up and becomes sensible, he will know how difficult it is for you.”

“Grow up? How much more do you want him to grow up?”Madam Lin looked at Feng Qianhua. “He is already 19 years old now! He will be going to university soon! Qianhua, tell me, how much more do you want him to grow up to understand?”
