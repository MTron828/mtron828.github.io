Translator: 549690339

“When the reason was mentioned, Mrs. Duanmu’s expression turned a little ugly. “I don’t know what your uncle is up to! He suddenly decided to bring all the family members on Earth!” ”

“What?”

“Upon hearing this, Duanmu Fengyu immediately lost her composure. ”

What was Cen Haifeng doing?

Was he still asleep?

“If he really brought the whole family here, then what was Duanmu Fengfei? ”

“Not to mention Duanmu fengfei, even she was very angry when she heard this! ”

“Besides, what else did those low-level earthlings do besides being used as fertility tools? ”

What qualifications did they have to come to the General Alliance?

What qualifications did they have to live with Duanmu Fengfei?

Weren’t they deliberately trying to disgust people?

“”Uncle...”Duanmu Feng narrowed her eyes and continued, “Is uncle just saying that, or is he serious?” ”

“Mrs. Duanmu looked around and said, “Let’s talk inside.” ”

“There were so many people outside, so how could they talk about this? ”

“Okay.”Duanmu Feng nodded and followed Mrs. Duanmu into the house.

The two of them walked into the house together.

“Duanmu Fengyu closed the doors and windows and continued, “Mom, what’s going on with uncle? He can’t be serious, right?” ”

“Mrs. Duanmu said, “He seems serious. Otherwise, your aunt wouldn’t have called me over.” ”

“Hearing this, Duanmu Fengyu frowned. ”

She didn’t expect things to turn out this way.

She didn’t expect Cen Hai Feng to make such a request.

“What did your Aunt Say?”Duanmu Feng and Mrs. Duanmu asked.

“”Of course, your aunt is unwilling,”Mrs. Duanmu continued, “But you should know your aunt’s character. In the past two years, she has become increasingly unable to control your uncle. Sigh...” ”

“At the end of her sentence, Mrs. Duanmu sighed. ”

Duanmu fengyu frowned.

“At this moment, Mrs. Duanmu seemed to have thought of something. She looked at duanmu Fengyu and said, “And did you know that your uncle also requested to bring back that woman from Earth!” ”

“Zhou Xiang?”Duanmu Fengyu asked.

“”Yes.”Mrs. Duanmu nodded and continued, “Not only her, but also Dongli’s current girlfriend.” ”

“”What?”This time, Duanmu Fengyu was completely unable to remain calm! ”

“Now, it was not only Duanmu Fenfei’s problem, but also her problem. ”

If she really brought back that woman from Earth.

Then what would she do?

Duanmu fenfei would not allow her man to have other women when he had him!

Even if he did not have a status.

Her pride and self-esteem would not allow her to commit to such a marriage!

“At this moment, Duanmu Fengyu’s face turned pale. ”

She felt as if she had eaten a fly.

“”But Fengyu, don’t be too anxious.”Mrs. Duanmu patted Duanmu Fengyu’s shoulder. “With your aunt around, she won’t allow such a thing to happen.” ”

“Duanmu fengyu continued, “Mom, have you seen Uncle Today?” ”

“No.”Mrs. Duanmu shook her head. “But your aunt still has an appointment with me tomorrow. I’ll go over tomorrow.”

“Can I go with you?”Duanmu Fengyu asked. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Upon hearing this, Mrs. Duanmu shook her head and continued, “I’m afraid that’s not appropriate, right? After all, this is a matter between elders.” ”

“Mrs. Duanmu’s words were reasonable. Duanmu Fengyu thought for a moment and said, “Mom, please tell aunt properly. Don’t let her agree to this!” ”

“”I know.”Mrs. Duanmu nodded. “Actually, your aunt isn’t willing either. When I went over today, her eyes were red. She must have quarreled with your uncle...” ”

“Duanmu Fengfei had been Cen Haifeng’s wife for the rest of his life, and now he was suddenly going to be his first wife. No one could stand it! ”

“”Mom,”Duanmu Fengfei looked at Mrs. Duanmu and said, “I still want to go to Earth.” ”

“Just as Duanmu Fengfei gave up the idea of going to Earth, this thought appeared again ”

“”No.”Mrs. Duanmu held Duanmu Fengyu’s hand. “No, you can’t take such a risk now! If someone finds out, you’ll be finished!” ”

“”Mom, I won’t tell. If you don’t tell, I won’t be found out,”Duanmu Fengyu said. ”

“”No.”Mrs. Duanmu’s attitude was very firm, “Fengyu, your bright future has just begun. Your future will be bright. If you make a mistake now, not only will you be unlucky, but the entire duanmu family will also be unlucky!” ”
