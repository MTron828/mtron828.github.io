“”Alright.”Song Shiyu nodded and continued, “How do you want me to cooperate with you?” ”

“The surprise came too suddenly, making doctor Liu very incredulous. He turned to look at song Shiyu and said, “Boss song, Wait a moment. I’ll make a plan. Your eating habits and rest habits will follow the plan.” ”

“Okay.”Song Shiyu nodded slightly.

“Doctor Liu continued, “Then I’ll go back and make a plan now.” ”

“Doctor Liu was eager to cure song Shiyu. Firstly, because he was a doctor. ”

“Secondly, because of his reputation. ”

“It had been a while since he came to the song family, but not only did song Shiyu not get better, he was getting worse. Those who knew knew knew that it was song Shiyu who did not cooperate, and those who did not know thought that it was because his medical skills were too poor! ”

What doctors cared about the most was reputation.

“Let’s go to my study.”Song Shiyu stood up.

Doctor Liu was stunned. Song Shiyu had really changed a lot today. He did not even dare to acknowledge him anymore.

“”Okay, okay.”Doctor Liu immediately stood up and followed song Shiyu’s footsteps. ”

The two of them walked upstairs to the study.

Song Shiyu turned on the computer and let Doctor Liu operate it. “This is a printer. You can use it directly.”

“”Thank you, Boss Song.”Doctor Liu was a little overwhelmed by the favor. ”

Song Shiyu today was too abnormal!

What was wrong with him?

“Song Shiyu smiled and said, “I should be the one thanking you.” ”

“After all, it was doctor Liu who was treating him. ”

“”Boss song,”doctor Liu asked hesitantly as he prepared the plan, “Why did you suddenly think it through?” ” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Song Shiyu peeled a cream candy. “I... I suddenly feel that living is pretty good.”

Yes.

At least there was hope to live.

“If he died, there was no hope at all. ”

Doctor Liu was stunned.

So it turned out that song Shiyu had not cooperated with the treatment before because he did not want to live anymore?

The world of the rich was really complicated and difficult to understand!

“Song Shiyu had everything he wanted. He had a mansion, a luxury car, fame, beauty, and everything else. ”

But such a person actually didn’t want to live anymore.

This was the first time doctor Liu had met such a simple and plain rich person.

“”You won’t suddenly Change Your Mind Midway, right?”Doctor Liu was a little worried and asked. ”

“”Don’t worry, I Won’t,”song Shiyu said. ”

Doctor Liu nodded. “That’s good.”

“Immediately, doctor Liu was filled with confidence. He would definitely be able to cure song Shiyu. ”

On the other side.

Old Master Chen returned home.

“Chen Siyao was waiting for him in the living room. When she saw Old Master Chen come over, Chen Siyao immediately ran over. “Grandpa!” ”

“Yaoyao.”Old Master Chen smiled.

“Chen siyao continued, “Did you go to Shiyu’s Place?” ”

“Looking at Chen Siyao’s hopeful face, Old Master Chen suddenly didn’t know how to answer. ”

Song Shiyu was too heartless!

“He had already done what he had to do, but Song Shiyu wasn’t willing to accept Chen Siyao. ”

There was nothing he could do!

“I went.”Old Master Chen nodded.

“Seeing old master Chen’s complicated expression, Chen Siyan suddenly had a bad feeling. ”

“”Grandpa, Shiyu...” ”

“Old Master Chen Sighed and grabbed Chen Siyao’s hand. “Yaoyao, you have to trust Grandpa. You’ll definitely find someone better in the future.” ”

Song Shiyu was nothing!

He was just an ingrate. He wasn’t worthy of Chen Siyao at all.

Chen Siyao’s eyes turned red instantly.

She didn’t expect song Shiyu to reject Old Master Chen.

Did he hate being with her that much?

He couldn’t even get old master Chen to step in?

“”Yaoyao, Yaoyao,”seeing Chen Siyao like this, old master Chen immediately said, “Yaoyao, don’t Be Like This! Song Shiyu isn’t the only man in this world. You...” ”

“Before Old Master Chen could finish his sentence, he was interrupted by Chen Siyao. “But he’s the only one I love!” ”

There was only one song Shiyu in this world that she loved!

“”Yaoyao, wake up.”Old Master Chen sighed, “I also want to have a proper relationship with him, but he just doesn’t want to accept you! In order for the two of you to be together, I don’t even want this old face anymore. It’s not sweet to force things. Give up.” ”

It’s not sweet to force things...

“When Chen Siyao heard this, her face was filled with a pale smile. ”

“”Grandfather, is there no other way?”Chen Siyao wasn’t willing to give up just like that. She held old master Chen’s hand tightly and said in a sobbing voice, “I’m begging you, grandfather. Please think of another way!” ”

She couldn’t live without song Shiyu.

“From the moment she met Song Shiyu, she had fallen deeply in love with him. ”
