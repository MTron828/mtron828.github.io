Translator: 549690339

Cen Yuyan felt a little uncomfortable listening to these words.

“Actually, what Zhou Rui said was quite right. ”

“No matter how Zhou Xiang treated her, she was still Zhou Xiang’s daughter. If Zhou Xiang didn’t exist, she wouldn’t exist... ”

She shouldn’t turn a blind eye to Zhou Xiang.

“Thinking of this, Cen Yuyan turned to look at Zhou Rui. “Alright, I’ll listen to you.” ”

“Zhou rui smiled and said, “Where is Auntie Waiting for you? I’ll send you over.” ”

“Cen Yuyan said, “At a teahouse on Haibo Road.” ”

“”Alright.”Zhou Rui took out a jacket and draped it over Cen Yuyan. “The temperature is low at night, so it’s draped over the shoulders.” ”

“Okay.”Cen Yuyan nodded.

The two of them went out together.

“Soon, they arrived at the teahouse on Haibo Road. ”

“Zhou Xiang sat by the window. The moment Cen Yuyan got off the car, she caught sight of Cen Yuyan’s figure in the crowd, as well as Zhou Rui, who was walking beside Cen Yuyan. ”

Zhou Xiang frowned slightly.

“Cen Yuyan was born into a wealthy family and had been pampered since she was young. She had seen many celebrities and dignitaries since she was young. Logically speaking, she should not have been deceived by a gigolo like Zhou Rui. ”

“However, Cen Yuyan had fallen for it. ”

Zhou Xiang sighed.

“At that moment, a member walked in from outside the door. “Mom.” ”

Zhou Xiang raised his head slightly. “Have a seat.”

Cen Yuyan sat opposite Zhou Xiang.

“Why are you looking for me?”Cen Yuyan looked at Zhou Xiang.

“Zhou Xiang said, “I feel that the two of us should have a good talk.” ”

Cen Yuyan nodded.

“Zhou Xiang continued, “Your father left early. All these years, Shaoqing has been supporting the family. If it wasn’t for Shaoqing, our family wouldn’t be where we are now!”! “Now, Shaoqing has finally opened her heart and found her true love. Zhuluo is a very good and outstanding girl. Everyone in the family, including your three sisters, likes Zhuluo very much. Why do you have such a deep opinion of Zhuluo?” ”

“After Cen Haifeng left, Zhou Xiang only felt that the sky had collapsed. ”

Her world was in darkness.

It was Cen Shaoqing who used his tender shoulders to shoulder the sky for her and the Cen family. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

How Old was Cen Shaoqing at that time?

Eighteen years old.

No one knew what an eighteen-year-old boy had gone through to carve out a bloody path in the business world and nail the CEN family to the top of the business world.

“Later, Cen Shaoqing’s mind was completely focused on the business world. ”

“It was not easy for him to have free time, so he ran to the temple. ”

Zhou Xiang was really worried.

She was worried that Cen Shaoqing would one day understand the mortal world and her son would never come back.

Fortunately.

“Fortunately, Cen Shaoqing’s life walked into a girl named Ye Zhuo. ”

It was ye Zhuo who let Cen Shaoqing see the beauty of tomorrow.

“Therefore, besides liking ye Zao, Zhou Xiang was more grateful to him. ”

“Because to her, Ye Zao was not only her future daughter-in-law. ”

She was also the salvation.

The salvation of the Cen family!

“Thinking of this, Zhou Xiang sighed softly, then, she said, “Your grandmother is not a muddle-headed person. Everything she did was for your own good. “Yuyan, just listen to my advice and break up with Zhou Rui as soon as possible. Also, Song Chenyu is not the same as you. I think you know very well why she is so close to you.” ”

“Cen Yuyan looked at Zhou Xiang, “Mom, you have a misunderstanding about Chenyu and Zhou Xiang, so I understand your feelings now. “Please put yourself in My Shoes. In My Eyes, Ye Zhuo and the Chenyu in your eyes are the same person as Zhou Rui. Can you understand my feelings now?” ”

“You can’t only care about your own psychological feelings. You should also think about me. Have you ever thought about why I have such a big opinion of Ye Zhuo? “Because ye Zao has done many disgusting things! “It was her doing that caused the misunderstanding between me and Chenyu last time!”

“Enough! Stop Talking!”Zhou Xiang scolded in a low voice. There was anger in her eyes. “Zao is not that kind of person!”

Zhou Xiang was the same as Old Lady Cen. She could not bear to hear others say anything wrong about ye Zao.

“In her eyes, Ye Zao was the best and most outstanding little fairy in the world. His weight was even more important than Cen Shaoqing in her heart. ”

“Now that Cen Yuyan had spoken so eloquently to ye Zao, how could Zhou Xiang endure it? ”

“CEN Yuyan said, “See, you’re favoring ye Zao. In Your Eyes, Ye Zao is more important than me, your biological daughter. You and Grandma are the same person! “Actually, Shaoqing doesn’t love ye Zao at all. He’s just putting on an act for all of you! “Do you really think that Shaoqing likes ye Zao so much? “Ye Zao, is she worthy?” ”

Zhou Xiang picked up the Teacup on the table and threw it at Cen Yuyan’s face.
