“”Then take care on the road,”Bai Jingshu instructed. ”

“”Okay, I will.” ”

Bai Jingshu stood at the door and watched Chen Yaosheng leave.

“At this moment, Chen Yaosheng seemed to have remembered something. He stopped and looked back at Bai Jingshu, “Oh right, Jingshu, don’t feel pressured by my words today. It’s hard to find a good friend. In fact, I think that even if we can’t be a couple, it’s still not bad to be good friends.” ”

“Chen Yaosheng acted gentlemanly and generous. In addition, he had a good appearance and had a common language with Bai Jingshu. ”

Very few girls could reject such a man.

“At this moment, Bai Jingshu even thought of directly agreeing to Chen Yaosheng. ”

“Coincidentally, her parents were also urging her. ”

“However, she still managed to suppress this impulsive thought in time. ”

Impulsiveness was the devil.

She still had to think about it carefully

“Bai Jingshu smiled and nodded. “Yes, don’t worry. I will definitely think about it carefully.” ”

“”Okay, I’ll wait for you.”Chen yaosheng continued, “After you’ve thought about it, just contact me directly. In order to prevent it from affecting your thoughts, I won’t be chatting with you during this period of time.” ”

“Okay.”

“Then I’ll be leaving first. You should rest early tonight.”

“You too.”

“After saying goodbye to each other, Chen Yaosheng turned around and left. Very quickly, his back disappeared from the line of sight in front of him. ”

Bai Jingshu stood there for quite a while before she turned around and left.

On the other side.

Bai Mo had successfully obtained the itinerary for Manwen.

It was different from the image of a silkpants from before.

“Manwen no longer went to any romantic places, nor did it have any romantic news. ”

Bai Jingshu returned to the s galaxy and arrived at the Bai family’s old residence.

“Old Master Bai was sitting on a recliner in the courtyard, basking in the sun. ”

“Grandfather!”

“Hearing Bai Jingshu’s voice, Old Master Bai immediately stood up from the recliner. “Jingshu is here!” ”

“Bai Jingshu walked over to Old Master Bai’s side and held his arm. “Grandfather, why are you basking in the sun alone? Where’s Auntie Zhou?” ”

“Old Master Bai had a terminal case of indirect dizziness. He couldn’t be without people around him, otherwise, it would be very dangerous. ”

“”It’s fine, it’s fine. I know my own body very well.”Old Master Bai waved his hand and continued, “Jingshu, why did you suddenly come back?” ”

“”I missed Grandpa, so I came back to see him,”Bai Jingshu said. ”

“Old Master Bai smiled and said, “You Really Miss Grandpa?” ”

He could tell at a glance that his granddaughter had something on her mind.

“”As expected, you can’t hide anything from Grandpa.”Bai Jingshu held Old Master Bai’s arm. “Grandpa, someone is wooing me. Do you think I should agree to it?” ”

“”Judging from your appearance, you should have a good impression of him, right?”Old Master Bai asked back. ” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Bai Jingshu thought for a moment, then, she said, “I don’t know how to describe our relationship. I don’t hate him, but I don’t seem to like him that much either. However, we have many hobbies in common. For example, we like the same books, and our tastes are very similar. He likes what I like, and I like what he likes. “But right now, I don’t know what to choose.” ”

Elder Bai looked at Bai Jingshu. “How long have you two known each other?”

“”Yes, if you’ve known each other, you’ve known each other for a long time, but we officially met half a month ago,”Bai Jingshu continued. “I had a deep misunderstanding about him before. I felt that he wasn’t from the same world as me, but after getting along with him, I realized that he was quite a nice person. “He’s very different from what I imagined.” ”

“Bai Jingshu had never been in a relationship before, nor had she ever liked anyone. She didn’t know what she wanted or liked. ”

“You can tell in ten days that he’s from the same world as you?”Old Master Bai asked.

Bai Jingshu hesitated for a moment but didn’t say anything.

“Old Master Bai continued, “Men and women think differently. “They like to conquer, and conquering will give them a sense of accomplishment. For this sense of accomplishment, they will do anything. “Jingshu, I feel that the time you’ve known each other is still too short. “You should get to know each other better.” ”

“”Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded. “Grandpa, I understand.” ”

“Old Master Bai smiled and said, “Jingshu, don’t put too much pressure on yourself. My words can only guide you, not help you choose. “If you feel that the time is right and you understand the other party’s character very well, then you don’t have to worry so much and can openly start a relationship.” ”

“Mm.”

“As he said this, elder Bai seemed to have suddenly thought of something and continued, “Where are you from, young man?” ”
