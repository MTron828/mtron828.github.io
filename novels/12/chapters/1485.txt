“”Boss, they stopped the car.”The driver in the driver’s seat looked back at the back seat. ”

“”Slow down,”the man in the back seat said. ”

“Okay.”The driver immediately slowed down.

“At this moment, they saw the white car driver in front open the door and get out of the car. Then, a young girl sat in the back seat. ”

The driver immediately reported the situation to the man in the back seat.

“The man narrowed his eyes and did not say anything. Instead, he said, “Just remember what the princess said.” ”

“Got it.”

Jin Yuyan was a ruthless person.

“If she could not get it, she would destroy it! ”

“Ye Zhuo and Bai Xiaosu were in a foreign country. Even if something went wrong, no one would be able to find out anything. ”

“Besides, Jin Yuyan had done her research. Under ye Zao’s guidance, Bai Xiaosu’s shooting skills had improved by leaps and bounds. It would not be a problem for her to get first place. If she did not take action, Korea would not even be able to get into the top three! ”

Therefore.

Bai Xiaosu and ye Zao had to disappear from this world today.

Over here.

“Ye Zao was already sitting in the driver’s seat. He fastened his seatbelt and started the engine. “Xiaosu, sit tight.” ”

“Bai Xiaosu nodded. “Miss Ye, please take care of your safety.” ”

“Okay.”

“The next second, the car that was originally parked on the spot rushed out quickly. ”

It was extremely fast!

It was so fast that it was hard for people to react.

The driver in the Toyota Meikary was stunned.

The car in front.

Was the driver really a little girl?

The Man in the backseat narrowed his eyes. “What are you daydreaming about? Hurry up and follow her!”

“Okay!”The driver quickly reacted and sped up to catch up with the car in front.

Ye Zao looked at the little tail that had caught up in the rearview mirror and curled his lips slightly.

You want to play?

Then I’ll play along with you!

“Ye Zao stepped on the accelerator to the bottom and drifted over, leaving the car far behind. Then, he hid in the traffic. ”

“Bai Xiaosu leaned on the back window and said excitedly, “We lost them! Miss Ye, we lost them!” ”

“It’s not that simple.”

“”Ah?”Before Bai Xiaosu could react, the Black Toyota Meikary caught up again. ”

“Moreover, it looked like it was going to crash at any moment. ”

The car was destroyed and people were killed!

These four words popped up in Bai Xiaosu’s mind.

It had to be like this!

The other party was planning this.

“Thinking of this, the color on Bai Xiaosu’s face immediately disappeared. “Miss Ye, their, their goal is to destroy our car and kill us?” ”

“Yes.”

Ye Zao’s beautiful eyes narrowed.

“In front of them was a viaduct, and under the viaduct was a forest. ”

They were still one kilometer away from the viaduct.

“Ye Zao turned the steering wheel and drove on the far right side of the road, preparing to get on the viaduct. ”

The car behind them followed closely.

“The Man in the back seat opened the window and looked at the road condition, then said, “The viaduct in front is a place where traffic accidents are easy to happen. It’s the most suitable place to do it. Remember to throw it accurately!” ”

“Understood.”The driver whistled.

He was the best at creating traffic accidents.

“Otherwise, Jin Yuyan would not have invited him over. ”

The driver sped up. He held the steering wheel with one hand and picked up the miniature bomb that he had prepared beforehand with the other. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“”Miss Ye! They’re chasing us!”Seeing the scene in the rearview mirror, Bai Xiaosu’s face turned pale. He had never felt that death was so close to him. ”

“Don’t panic.”

Ye Zao was still calm. He calmly avoided the car in front of him and then suddenly turned the steering wheel to the left.

He directly passed a huge off-road vehicle!

The car following behind did not expect ye Zao to suddenly make such a move.

“Even more unexpectedly, there was an off-road vehicle in front of ye Zao. The driver’s face was pale. In order to avoid hitting the off-road vehicle, he suddenly stepped on the brakes! ”

Chi!

The wheels scraped against the ground with a loud sound.

Bang!

“Just as the driver was about to heave a sigh of relief, his eyes suddenly widened. There was actually a huge bend in front of him. At this moment, it was too late for him to brake again, he could only watch helplessly as the car fell off the 100-meter-high high education bridge. ”

Boom.

It was deafening.

“The moment the car fell, it exploded and flames shot into the sky. ”

“Fortunately, there was a forest below. Otherwise, the consequences would have been unimaginable. ”

Bai Xiaosu watched the scene outside from the car window. His heart was racing. They were almost the ones who were almost killed.

“After a long while, Bai Xiaosu finally reacted. He took a deep breath and looked up at Ye Zao. ”

Ye Zao was still as calm as ever. It was as if she wasn’t the one who had caused the car accident.

“It was a serious car accident, but her hands were still clean. ”

On the other side.

Jin Yuyan had been waiting for the news.

“At this moment, the phone rang. Jin Yuyan quickly picked up the call. She didn’t know what was said on the other side, but Jin Yuyan frowned. “What? !” ”
