On the other side.

“After the communication with Mario was cut off, Ye Zao put on her lab coat and entered the laboratory. ”

“Miss Ye!”

“Seeing her enter, worker xu said in surprise, “Didn’t you already get off work?” ”

“Ye Zao said, “It’s not a big deal to go back. Have the test results come out?” ”

“Even if she went back now, she wasn’t in the mood to rest. ”

She might as well come to the laboratory and study with everyone.

Worker Xu shook his head. “There’s still one more program left.”

“After all, they had never seen such a strange beast before. Many things were new to them, so the data wasn’t easy to grasp. The slightest mistake could result in mistakes. ”

“”Bring me in to take a look,”ye Zhuo continued. ”

“Come with me.”Worker Xu immediately went forward to lead the way.

“As soon as he entered, he saw a tall and well-built figure standing in front of the experiment table. ”

“He just stood there, slightly rolling up his sleeves, and was injecting something into his arm. ”

“The action was very simple, but his entire body was bursting with an aura that could not be ignored. ”

“”Cen Shaoqing!”Although his face was almost completely hidden under the mask, Ye Zhuo still recognized him at a glance. ”

“Hearing this, the man looked back slightly and was stunned for a moment. ”

“As if he didn’t expect the person to be ye Zhuo, he immediately hid the syringe and pretended as if nothing had happened. “Leader, why are you here?” ”

“What did you hide?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“”Nothing,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

Ye Zhuo’s beautiful eyes narrowed. “Really nothing?”

“It’s really nothing.”

“Little Chen.”Ye Zao looked at Cen Shaoqing’s assistant.

The assistant was also in a difficult position.

On one side was the leader.

On the other side was the leader of the leader.

It was not good to offend anyone.

“After holding it in for a long time, the assistant looked at Ye Zao. “Miss Ye, I don’t know anything.” ”

He was just an assistant.

Ye Zao turned around and looked at Cen Shaoqing. “Speak for yourself.”

Cen Shaoqing felt his scalp go numb.

How could he have known that ye Zhuo would suddenly come over.

The assistant was so frightened that he did not even dare to raise his head.

He was transparent.

He was transparent.

He could not see or hear anything.

“Cen Shaoqing smiled at Ye Zhuo. “It’s really nothing. By the way, didn’t you get off work? Did you forget something? Go back quickly. I’ll be fine as long as I’m in the laboratory.” ”

“Stop changing the topic.”Ye Zhuo looked at Cen Shaoqing. “I’ll give you another chance to show off.”

“”It’s really nothing,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

Ye Zhuo walked to Cen Shaoqing’s side. “Give me your hand.”

Give me your hand?

How could he give me his hand in the current situation!

Wouldn’t he be exposed if he gave me his hand!

No.

But he couldn’t ignore ye Zhuo’s words.

Cen Shaoqing immediately signaled to his assistant.

“The assistant reacted and was about to take a step forward, but ye Zao noticed him. “Little Chen, just stand there.” ”

“After saying that, ye Zao turned to look at Cen Shaoqing. “You, stretch out your hand. Stop fooling around.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing raised his hand to touch his nose, but he refused to take out his hand that was hidden behind his back. ”

“At that moment, ye Zao grabbed his hand. ”

“When she saw what was in Cen Shaoqing’s hand, she was stunned. Her eyes were filled with disbelief. “What are you doing?” ”

Cen Shaoqing was about to explain.

“The assistant understood that he could no longer be transparent. He immediately stood up and said, “Miss Ye, it’s like this. No one in the lab knows if there are any harmful ingredients in the c 1 potion, so...” ”

“”So, you’re using yourself as an experiment?”Ye Zhuo looked at Cen Shaoqing. ”

Cen Shaoqing glared at the assistant. “I want you to keep your mouth shut!”

The assistant shuddered in fright.

“This isn’t just about Xiao Chen.”Ye Zhuo turned to look at Xiao Chen. “You can go home first.”

“”Thank you, Miss Ye.” ”

“With Ye Zhuo’s words, he wasn’t afraid that Cen Shaoqing would vent his anger on him. ”

“After all, Ye Zao was the leader of a leader. ”

“After the assistant left, ye Zao frowned slightly. “Are you crazy? Do you know how dangerous it is for you to do this? !” ”

C 1 was one of the ingredients used to conquer the exotic beast virus.

“If anything went wrong, the consequences would be unimaginable! ” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Cen Shaoqing was too bold. He actually dared to use himself as an experiment.

“”It’s fine. Look, I’ve been injected for a few minutes. isn’t everything fine?”Cen Shaoqing helped Ye Zao push his messy hair to the back of his head. “Also, I believe in You.” ”

I believe in you.

“It was only a very simple word, but it was loud and clear. ”

C1 drug was developed by Ye Zao. The ingredients were very bold and had many fatal toxins.

“Therefore, no one dares to try it out. ”

“Most importantly, this kind of medicinal mice or other animals can not be replaced at all. ”
