“Lin Qingxuan felt that what ye Zao said was very reasonable. She smiled and said, “Thank you, Zao Zao! Fourth Uncle really listened to you today. It’s better than ten years of studying!” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Fourth uncle, it’s good that you can understand this logic.” ”

She was most afraid that Lin Qingxuan would go into a dead end.

“Lin Qingxuan looked at Lin Jincheng and ye Shu. “Jincheng, sister-in-law, I’ll be leaving first then!” ”

“Lin Jincheng followed Lin Qingxuan’s footsteps and asked worriedly, “Fourth brother, where are you going?” ”

“Lin Qingxuan raised her voice and said, “To where I should go!” ”

“Ye Shu walked over from behind and said with a smile, “I’m definitely going to look for sister Xiaoman.” ”

“Lin Jincheng looked at Lin Qingxuan’s back as she disappeared into the night and continued, “I hope that fourth brother and Madam Xia will have a good ending.” ”

“Ye Shu said, “Don’t worry. I can tell that fourth brother has already thought it through. He and sister Xiaoman will definitely have a good ending.” ”

Lin Jincheng nodded.

“In fact, Lin Qingxuan really went to look for Xia Xiaoman. She even specially brought the proposal ring that she had prepared beforehand. ”

“Although it was already past nine o’clock in the evening, when Xia Xiaoman received a call from Lin Qingxuan, she still went outside immediately. ”

Lin Qingxuan stood under the street lamp and waited for her.

“Under the dim yellow light, Xia Xiaoman saw that his waist was straight. Suddenly, it rang. Lin Qingxuan was also a member of the army. ”

“Xiaoman!”

Xia Xiaoman walked to Lin Qingxuan’s side. “Why did you call me out so late?”

“I did!”Lin Qingxuan nodded. “And it’s a major event in my life.”

“Before Xia Xiaoman could react, Lin Qingxuan suddenly knelt down on one knee and opened the box of the diamond ring. “Xiaoman, can you marry me?” ”

Propose?

Xia Xiaoman was stunned for a few seconds before she realized that Lin Qingxuan was proposing to her.

“Lin Qingxuan continued, “Xiaoman, don’t worry. I’ll take good care of you for the rest of my life. I’ll also take care of Lizi as my own flesh and blood.” ”

“Xia Xiaoman didn’t immediately take the diamond ring. Instead, she said, “Did your mother agree to your proposal?” ”

“Lin Qingxuan looked into Xia Xiaoman’s eyes. “Xiaoman, it’s between you and me when I’m with you. It has nothing to do with my mother! Even if she doesn’t agree, I still want to be with you!” ”

“After saying that, Lin Qingxuan took out the household register from his bag. “I’ve thought it through. Let’s go to the Civil Affairs Bureau to get our marriage certificate tomorrow!” ”

“Have you really thought about it?”Xia Xiaoman looked down at Lin Qingxuan.

“Lin Qingxuan nodded seriously. “Yes, I’ve already thought about it.” ”

“No regrets?”

“”Never!”Lin Qingxuan held the diamond ring and the Household Register. “Xiaoman, please marry me.” ”

“Actually, Xia Xiaoman wanted Lin Qingxuan to have an attitude. ”

She didn’t want her partner to be a Mama’s boy who had to listen to his mother.

“She was very surprised that Lin Qingxuan could have such a change. She thought that Lin Qingxuan would hesitate for a long time, but she did not expect Lin Qingxuan to make a decision so quickly. ”

“Xia Xiaoman passed her hand to Lin Qingxuan, her eyes watery. “Okay, I promise you.” ”

Lin Qingxuan immediately held Xia Xiaoman’s hand and put the diamond ring on her ring finger.

“At this moment, Lin Qingxuan’s hand was shaking. ”

“In his dreams, he had dreamed countless times of him putting the diamond ring on Xia Xiaoman. He didn’t expect that the day would come so soon. ”

“”Xiaoman, thank you.”Lin Qingxuan slowly planted a kiss on Xia Xiaoman’s ring finger. ”

“That night, Lin Qingxuan and Xia Xiaoman spent the night in a nearby hotel. ”

“At 9:30 am the next day, the two of them appeared at the entrance of the Civil Affairs Bureau and successfully received their marriage certificate. ”

“After receiving their marriage certificate, Lin Qingxuan and Xia Xiaoman brought an Lizi to a restaurant to eat and celebrate. ”

“An Lizi was very happy when she heard that Xia Xiaoman and Lin Qingxuan had already received their marriage certificate. This time, she really became ye Zhuo’s cousin. ”

“An lizi smiled and said, “Uncle Lin, when are you going to prepare the wedding with my mother?” ”

“Lin Qingxuan said, “Your mother and I have already discussed it. The wedding will be held on the eighth day of next month.”After the wedding, they would go on a honeymoon trip. ”

“At their age, of course, they would do whatever was romantic. ” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Really?”

“Yes.”Lin Qingxuan nodded.

“After eating and sending the mother and daughter home, Lin Qingxuan returned to the Lin family and couldn’t wait to tell Lin Jincheng and ye Shu about him and Xia Xiaoman getting married. ”

“Hearing this, Ye Shu said in surprise, “Really?” ”

She didn’t expect that Lin Qingxuan would get the marriage certificate in one night.

Lin Qingxuan nodded. “It’s true.”

“Afraid that Ye Shu and Lin Jincheng wouldn’t believe it, Lin Qingxuan even took out the marriage certificate. ”

“After seeing the marriage certificate, ye Shu dared to believe it. ”

“Lin Qingxuan continued, “I plan to hold the wedding with Xiaoman on the eighth day of next month and live with Xiaoman after the wedding.” ”

“”Fourth brother, have you thought about it?”Lin Jincheng raised his head to look at Lin Qingxuan. ”

“”Yes, I have.” ”

“Lin Jincheng continued, “Since you have thought about it, don’t let fourth sister-in-law down.” ”

“”Don’t worry, I won’t let her down.” ”

“After saying that, Lin Qingxuan continued, “Jincheng, what do you think we should do if mom doesn’t help us host the wedding?” ”

“Lin Jin Cheng said, “Elder brother is like a father, and elder sister-in-law is like a mother. If it really comes to that, let elder brother and sister-in-law be your wedding witnesses!” ”

“With Lin Jin Cheng’s words, Lin Qingxuan felt much more at ease. ”

“In the following days, Lin Qingxuan did not go to look for Old Lady Lin anymore. She was at ease with Xia Xiaoman to prepare for their new home and the necessities for the wedding. ”

“The day before the wedding, Lin Qingxuan looked for Old Lady Lin. “Mom, I’m getting married. I hope you can come to my wedding.” ”

“Married?”Old Lady Lin frowned. “With who?”

“Xiaoman.”

Xia Xiaoman.

It was Xia Xiaoman again.

Old Lady Lin was furious. “How many times have I told you? I don’t agree to the two of you being together.”

“Lin Qingxuan continued, “Whether you agree or not, we have to be together. The wedding is scheduled for tomorrow.” ”

“”Lin Qingxuan, for that woman, you don’t even want your own mother anymore?”Old Lady Lin was trembling with anger. ”

“Lin Qingxuan bowed to Old Lady Lin. “Mother, that’s all I have to say.” ”

“After saying that, Lin Qingxuan turned around and left. ”

“Old Lady Lin shouted at Lin Qingxuan’s back, “Come back! Come back quickly!” ”

Lin Qingxuan acted as if he didn’t hear her.

“Auntie Wang supported Old Lady Lin and said worriedly, “Old Lady, do you think Qingxuan will really marry Xia Xiaoman?” ”

“Don’t worry! He doesn’t have the guts!”Old Lady Lin understood her son.

“Without her consent, Lin Qingxuan didn’t dare to marry Xia Xiaoman at all. ”
