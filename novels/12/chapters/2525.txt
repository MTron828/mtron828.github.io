“”Grandpa,”Lin Ze put down his teacup and continued, “I’m married to Jingshu. You’re being too polite. My House is her house, and my parents are her parents.” ” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Elder Bai looked at Lin Ze with a gratified look in his eyes.

It was really important to teach by example.

“Lin Jincheng and ye Shu were both very kind people, and so was Lin Ze. ”

“Elder bai continued, “Ah Ze, I’m getting old. I don’t know which comes first, tomorrow or the accident. My only wish right now is to see Jingshu and the child live happily ever after. I watched Jingshu grow up. That child’s personality is quite gentle, but it’s inevitable that she’ll have her own temper. I hope you can be more tolerant of her in the future.” ”

“At this point, Old Master Bai’s eyes turned slightly red. He sobbed, “Jingshu is different from the other children. Once I leave, she won’t have a family anymore!” ”

This was what Old Master Bai was most worried about.

“If a girl was wronged in her in-laws’family, the first thing she would think of would definitely be her family. ”

But Bai Jingshu didn’t have a family.

It was better to have no parents like that.

“As one gets older, especially at Old Master Bai’s age, one should consider one’s own future. ”

Old Master Bai did not have anything else that he could not let go of.

The only person he could not let go of was Bai Jingshu.

“It’s all my fault for not teaching my son well! I’ve harmed Jingshu!”Old Master Bai wiped away his tears.

“Children were born with a blank sheet of paper. No matter how adults taught them, the blank sheet of paper would develop in any direction. ”

“When elder Bai was young, he was often away from home. By the time he came to his senses, the children’s worldviews had already been formed. How could there be any hope of redemption? ”

“All these years, elder Bai had always regretted it. ”

He regretted that he had not done his duty as a father back then.

“Unfortunately, he was already in his eighties. There was no use in regretting it. ”

“”Grandfather, please don’t say that. You’ve already done very well. Other things have nothing to do with you,”Lin Ze continued. “Don’t worry. I’m Jingshu’s backer. I definitely won’t let her suffer any grievances.” ”

“Elder Bai looked up at Lin Ze and smiled with tears in his eyes. “Ah Ze, I believe in You!” ”

...

Time passed quickly.

“In the blink of an eye, ten days had passed. ”

On the 17th.

Lin Ze and Bai Jingshu arrived home on time.

“Ye Shu was really worried after not seeing Bai Jingshu for ten days. When she saw Bai Jingshu, she immediately went up to her and asked, “Did Jingshu have any other reactions during this period of time? Did you feel uncomfortable after staying in the shuttle for three days?” ”

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “Don’t worry, Mom. I’m fine everywhere. There’s nothing uncomfortable about me.” ”

“”That’s good.”Ye Shu grabbed Bai Jingshu’s hand and looked behind the two of them. Then, she said, “Didn’t I tell you to have your grandfather come and stay with us for a while? Why didn’t he come?” ”

“Bai Jingshu said, “Grandfather said that he was too lazy to go back and forth.”The thing that people feared the most when they were old was traveling back and forth. ”

Especially long distance travel.

“Elder Bai had already come to Earth previously and fulfilled his wish. Now, he no longer had any obsession to come. ”

“Ye Shu nodded. “That’s true. Old people are getting old, and they really don’t want to go back and forth. If you have time in the future, you can go back and visit Grandpa more often.” ”

“”Okay.”Lin Ze nodded. “Mom, don’t worry. Jingshu and I will definitely go back and visit Grandpa often.” ”

“”Okay.”Ye Shu continued, “Let’s go back quickly.” ”

“When they returned to the living room, Lin ze continued, “By the way, Mom, is there anyone from fifth brother’s family coming tomorrow?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Shu nodded.

Lin Ze looked around the living room. “Is burning not at home?”

“”Yes. I’ve been quite busy these past few days,”ye Shu said. “I heard that there’s a very strange patient who’s quite troublesome.” ”

“Patient?”Lin Ze frowned slightly.

Ye Shu nodded. “I’m not too sure either. I heard that the little girl is quite young. She’s only fourteen.”

“Bai Jingshu asked, “Is it a very serious illness?” ”

“”Yes, I heard that it is.” ”

“Bai Jingshu said regretfully, “It’s such a pity that she’s only fourteen. I hope that the little girl can recover soon.” ”

“Lin Ze placed his hand on her shoulder. “Don’t worry. With the burn, the young lady will definitely be fine.” ”

At the hospital.

Wei Wei’s condition had not improved in the past few days.

“However, she was actually quite happy. ”

At least she could eat whatever she wanted these few days.

Ye Zhoutong talked to doctor Wang as he walked towards the ward.
