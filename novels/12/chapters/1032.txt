Remove her identity as the heir?

Xi Weiyue narrowed her eyes when she heard this.

Her identity as the heir was personally acknowledged by ye Langhua!

What right did Zhao Xueyin have to be removed?

The reason why Zhao Xueyin wanted to remove her identity as the heir must be because she was jealous of her!

“She was so outstanding and was also grandfather Ye’s heir. Her shares were higher than Zhao Xueyin’s. Once she joined the Shunxi Financial Group, would others still be able to see Zhao Xueyin?”

That was why Zhao Xueyin wanted to kick her out of the Shunxi Financial Group!

But was she that easy to bully?

Did Zhao Xueyin really think that she was a pushover?

That she could be controlled by others?

“Xi Weiyue raised her head to look at Zhao Xueyin. Her eyes were filled with ridicule. “Revoke my status as the successor? Just based on you? Miss Zhao, I think you’re Dreaming!””

“Zhao Xueyin’s expression did not change. She turned to look at Si lui and her voice was still gentle. “Big Brother Si, please ask her to leave.””

“Si Lui was stunned. When he saw Zhao Xueyin’s determined expression, he turned to look at Xi Weiyue. “Miss XI, Please!””

“XI weiyue said angrily, “I am my grandfather’s heir! My grandfather owns 60% of the shares of the Shunxi Financial Group! None of you have the right to revoke my status as heir!”” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Zhao Xueyin looked at Xi Weiyue. “Miss XI, I will persuade you nicely. Please have some self-respect! Don’t refuse a toast only to be forced. Girls still have some dignity.””

“Her tone was gentle, but every word seemed to carry a knife. A normal person would not be able to withstand it.”

“Xi Weiyue laughed out loud. “I’ve never been forced to drink a forfeit before! Today, I’d like to see what it’s like to be forced to drink a forfeit!””

Zhao Xueyin glanced at the lawyer.

The lawyer immediately understood and pressed the communicator on his chest. “Get the security team to go up to the 58th floor!”

“Roger.”A reply came from the other end of the communicator.

Xi Weiyue narrowed her eyes.

“The security team came very quickly. There were six people in total. Not only were they equipped with electric batons, they were also equipped with guns. “Chairman, what can I do for You?””

“Si Lu turned to look at Xi Weiyue. His gaze was very cold as he said, “Throw this person out!””

“Even though XI Weiyue was the successor that ye Langhua had personally acknowledged, Zhao Xueyin had never been an impulsive person. Since she had said so, she must have had her own reasons.”

The lawyer had absolute trust in Zhao Xueyin!

“”Yes, Chairman.”The leading security officer nodded and glanced at the team member beside him.”

The team member immediately understood and reached out to touch the stun baton on his waist.

“Xi Weiyue just stood there with her chin slightly raised. She said arrogantly, “I’m Grandfather Ye’s only heir, the future chief of the Shunxi Financial Group! I’d like to see which one of you dares to Touch Me!””

Would they dare to touch her?

Of course not!

“Seeing that the security guards stood there without taking any further action, the smug look in Xi Weiyue’s eyes became even more intense.”

She knew that they wouldn’t dare!

“But in the next second, Xi Weiyue was stunned.”

“When a security guard walked to Xi Weiyue’s side, he directly lifted her up and dragged her away.”

How Could Xi Weiyue be a match for a few strong men!

“Moreover, she also did not expect that Zhao Xueyin would really dare to lay a hand on her!”

Rebel! Rebel! This was simply rebel!

Could it be that Xi Weiyue did not want to stay in Shunxi Financial Group anymore?

“XI weiyue shouted angrily, “Let go of me! How dare you! You’re too bold! How dare you treat me like this, you’re all finished! Believe it or not, I can make you all not see the sun tomorrow with just one sentence!””

The few security personnel acted as if they did not hear Xi Weiyue’s words.

Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes.

“In the blink of an eye, Xi Weiyue was dragged out of the office.”

“The lawyer then turned to look at Zhao Xueyin. “Xueyin, is it really okay for us to treat Xi Weiyue like this?””

“Even though ye Langhua had not been in the financial world for many years, elder ye had a very high prestige in the financial world. If XI Weiyue really blew the matter up, it would not sound good if word got out, especially now that Zhao Xueyin was building up her connections.”

“If any rumors were to spread at this time, it would have a great impact on Zhao Xueyin!”

“Zhao Xueyin smiled slightly. “Don’t worry, Big Brother Si! I know what you mean. The call just now was from President Zhou. It was ye Langhua who personally removed Xi Weiyue’s identity as the heir.””

Si Lui was stunned.

Why would ye Langhua suddenly remove Xi Weiyue’s identity as the heir?

“The heir was not a child’s play. Although ye Langhua was not as glorious as she used to be, she was not muddle-headed.”

“Such a thing that went back on her words, she was not the kind of person who would joke about such things.”
