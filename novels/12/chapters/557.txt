“I don’t care.”Ye Zao sat on the sofa with an old man and crossed his legs. “Look at my brother.”

Ye Sen patted her with the thing in his hand. “Can’t a girl sit more elegantly?”

“”What’s there to be afraid of?”Ye Zao’s tone was indifferent. “Anyway, I already have a boyfriend.””

He didn’t have to worry that no one would want him.

“Ye Sen looked outside the door and continued, “Does ah ze know that you’re with Shaoqing?””

“Ye Zao shook his head and said in a suppressed voice, “I don’t know yet.””

“Then what do you plan to tell them?”Ye Sen asked again.

Ye Zao narrowed his eyes. “Let’s Wait a little longer.”

“Not long after, Lin Ze walked in from outside. Ye Sen asked Lin Ze what he wanted to eat.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Lin Ze said, “Let’s go to the riverside restaurant.””

The Riverside restaurant was famous for desserts.

How could a big boy like to eat desserts?

It was obvious that Lin Ze was there because of ye Zao.

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Brother, I ate a lot of desserts with my friends during the day. I don’t want to eat desserts now. Pick a place you like.””

“Lin Ze said, “I also like to eat desserts.””

“Although he hadn’t spent much time with Ye Zao, Lin Ze knew that ye Zao valued desserts. Even if she ate desserts every day and every meal, she could still do it.”

...

The Lin family.

“Because of Zhao Shuqi’s two slaps, Zhao shuning’s face was swollen like a pig’s head.”

“Lin Qingxuan was shocked when she saw Zhao shuning suddenly become like this. “Shuning, what happened to you?””

Zhao shuning gritted his teeth. “It’s all because of that good niece of yours!”

“Zha Zha?”Lin Qingxuan frowned. “What’s wrong with Zha Zha?”

Zhao shuning embellished the story.

Lin Qingxuan frowned slightly. “I’ve already told you not to get involved in this matter...”

“”Lin Qingxuan, what do you mean? Are you saying that I brought this on myself?”Zhao shuning glared at Lin Qingxuan, “If it weren’t for your brother and your niece, would something have happened to my brother? Would I have been slapped twice by my brother? Now my brother wants to cut off all ties with me! This is all your fault! It’s all your family’s fault!””

“At the end of his sentence, Zhao shuning directly went hysterical.”

“Lin Qingxuan was silent for a moment before taking out a small bottle. “Shuning, I have some ointment that can quickly remove bruises and swelling. Try It.”As he spoke, Lin Qingxuan unscrewed the lid of the ointment and applied it on Zhao shuning.”

The ointment didn’t smell very good. Zhao shuning frowned. “Where did you get the ointment?”

“Lin Qingxuan was about to say that it was given by ye Zhuo, but when she thought of Zhao Shuning’s resistance towards ye zhuo, she said, “I bought this from the pharmacy this morning. It’s very effective.””

“Zhao shuning looked up and saw that there was indeed no trace on Lin Qingxuan’s face. “Continue applying it. After you’re done applying it, go wash the clothes in the bathroom.””

“Zhao shuning’s body was golden and precious. She could not wear machine-washed clothes, but she was worried that the nanny at home would wash them. She was afraid that they would spit on her clothes, so the task of washing the clothes fell to Lin Qingxuan.”

Lin Qingxuan had washed Zhao shuning’s clothes for more than twenty years and was already used to it.

“”Okay.”After saying this, Lin Qingxuan hesitated for a moment and then asked, “Shuning, when can we adopt a child?””

“Let’s wait. There’s still no news from the countryside.”

“Lin qingxuan nodded and said, “How about we adopt a son and a Daughter?””

A son and a daughter?

Zhao shuning frowned and turned to look at Lin Qingxuan. “What do you mean?”

“Lin Qingxuan said, “It’s more lively with two children at home.””

“Zhao shuning snorted, “Lin Qingxuan, don’t think that I don’t know what you’re thinking! It’s been so many years, and everyone says that I can’t have children. I think you also think that I can’t have children! Lin Qingxuan, let me tell you, the one who can’t have children is you!””

“”Shuning, I didn’t mean that...”he only envied Lin Jin city for having a pair of outstanding children, so he also wanted to adopt a son and a daughter.”

“”If you didn’t mean that, then what did you mean?”Zhao shuning cried, “Lin Qingxuan, ask yourself, do you still have a conscience? ! Are You a man or not? ! I’ve sacrificed so much for your Lin family, but in the end, you still despised me! If I hadn’t married you back then, I would have children now! Why Did I marry you? Because I love you, but you trashed me just because I love you”

Now My Brother is going to disown me! Do you want to disown me too
