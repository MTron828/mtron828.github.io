Lin Jincheng nodded. “Quickly go back and rest.”

“After ye Zhuo left, only Lin Jincheng and Lin Qingxuan were left in the pavilion. ”

“Fourth brother?”

“Lin Qingxuan turned to look at Lin Jincheng. “Jincheng, I’ve been married to Shu Ning for 21 years. Do you think she would lie to me?” ”

“Lin Jincheng sighed. “Fourth brother, if this matter is really like what Zhonghua said, what do you plan to do?” ”

“It won’t happen. Shuning won’t lie to me.”

“Lin Jincheng continued, “We’ll know if she’s lying to you or not when we go to the hospital tomorrow.” ”

“Lin Qingxuan’s voice was a little shaky. “Can... can I not go to the hospital?”He and Zhao Shuning had been married for twenty-one years. If he went to the hospital for a checkup now, wouldn’t he be letting down Zhao shuning’s efforts all these years? ”

Wasn’t the couple’s life based on mutual trust?

“If the results of the checkup came out and it was still his fault, wouldn’t that be unfair to Zhao shuning. ”

Lin Qingxuan didn’t want to disappoint Zhao shuning.

He also didn’t want to betray Zhao shuning spiritually.

“After all, Zhao Shuning had given up too much for him. ”

“If it was still his fault, how could he face Zhao Shuning? ”

“”Fourth brother!”Lin Jincheng frowned, “This is a major event in life, you have to go!” ”

“If he didn’t know the secret, then forget it. Now that he knew the secret, he had to bring Lin Qingxuan to investigate it! ”

Give Lin Qingxuan Justice.

Lin Qingxuan took a deep breath.

“Seeing him like this, Lin Jincheng’s tone softened, “Fourth brother, going to the hospital for a re-examination is your responsibility! It’s also your responsibility to fourth sister-in-law! So you have to go! Haven’t you always wanted a child of your own? What if fourth sister-in-law is really lying to you?” ”

Lying? FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Would Zhao shuning really lie to him?

“I. . .”Lin Qingxuan felt a little dizzy. “I want to be alone.”

Lin Jincheng sighed. “I’ll accompany you.”

The two brothers stayed in the pavilion until the second half of the night before returning to each other’s rooms.

“Just as Lin Qingxuan pushed open the door, a glass flew over. ”

“Lin Qingxuan subconsciously flashed, and the glass fell to the ground. ”

Bang!

The pieces scattered in all directions.

“Lin Qingxuan! You Didn’t sleep at night. Where did you go?”Zhao shuning appeared in front of Lin Qingxuan with a ferocious look. “Let me ask you! Did you have a night out with a lover?”

Zhao shuning couldn’t accept that Lin Qingxuan had another woman outside.

“In this life, no one could get close to Lin Qingxuan except for her! ”

“At the thought of Lin Qingxuan sneaking out behind her back, Zhao Shuning was furious. ”

What could be good about going out in the middle of the night?

“Lin Qingxuan explained, “No, I talked to Jin Cheng Downstairs.” ”

“Talking? What can’t be said in the day but at night?”Zhao shuning couldn’t help but slap Lin Qingxuan’s face. “Lin Qingxuan! You’re lying!”

“Lin Qingxuan’s head was numb from the slap and his ears were buzzing. “Shuning, I’ve never had a lover. I was really chatting with Jin Cheng in the garden.” ”

“Zhao shuning narrowed her eyes, “Lin Qingxuan! Don’t think that I don’t know what you’re thinking! Aren’t you just envious that Lin Jin city has twins? But you can’t have children yourself, can you blame me? Don’t you think that I don’t want to have children? You Can’t have children yourself, so do you want to blame the problem on Me?” ”

“”Shuning,”Lin Qingxuan wiped the blood from the corner of her mouth. “I know that this is my own problem. I’ve never blamed you.” ”

Lin Qingxuan didn’t understand how humble she had to be for Zhao shuning to be satisfied.

“In order to not make Zhao shuning worry, he never talked to the opposite sex under Zhao Shuning’s eyes. ”

He got home before 9 o’clock at night.

He had to report his daily schedule.

He also had to be responsible for washing Zhao shuning’s clothes...

“Maybe it was because he had a guilty conscience, Zhao shuning never dared to believe Lin Qingxuan’s words. The more Lin Qingxuan explained, the more she felt that Lin Qingxuan was abnormal. ”

She couldn’t control her emotions.

“”You Didn’t blame me? You Didn’t blame me, so why did you sneak out behind my back? “I know, I’m old now, and my skin is flabby. I can’t compare to some vixens! “But was I like this from the beginning? “When I, Zhao shuning, was with you, I was also a beautiful little girl! It was you who forced me into this State!” ”

“Speaking up to this point, Zhao shuning choked and said, “You made me lose my right to be a mother. Now that I’m Old and past the optimal age to give birth, you want to abandon me? No Way!” ”
