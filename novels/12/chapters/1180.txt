Chapter 1181: 254: her face was pale. She had actually lost to someone she had never taken a fancy to! 3

Translator: 549690339

“After all, Qian Zhuo was a national player.”

It was normal for her to have a weird temper.

“...”Zhao Xueyin was still silent on the other end of the phone.

“Xueyin?”

“...”

“”Xueyin, it doesn’t matter if you can’t invite Qian Zhuo for a while. Back then, Liu Bei invited Zhuge Liang out of the mountain and even visited the cottage three times! At worst, we can also visit the thatched cottage three times! I believe that Qianzhu will definitely be moved by Your City Heart.””

Visit the thatched cottage three times?

Let her visit the thatched cottage three times to ye Zhuo?

What right did ye Zhuo have?

Ridiculous!

It was simply ridiculous.

“Ha!”

Zhao Xueyin sneered.

“This time, the lawyer was a little anxious.”

Things did not seem to be as simple as he thought.

“The lawyer knew Zhao Xueyin very well. If nothing particularly serious had happened, she would not be like this.”

Something must have happened!

“Thinking of this, Si Lui’s eyebrows jumped. He then asked, “Xueyin, where are you now?””

“Hearing this, Zhao Xueyin finally reacted. She looked at her surroundings and stammered, “I. . . I’m at the Financial Center.””

“Si lui continued, “Then stand there and don’t move. I’ll come to pick you up right away.””

“... Okay.”

“Si lui soon arrived. The car didn’t even stop before he jogged over. “Xueyin, are you okay?””

“”Big Brother Si...”Zhao Xueyin looked up at Si Lui, her eyes red.”

“Seeing that Zhao Xueyin was about to cry, Si Lui was heartbroken. “What happened? Who bullied you?””

“No.”Zhao Xueyin shook her head.

Si Lu frowned and pulled Zhao Xueyin’s hand. “Why is it so cold?”

Zhao Xueyin’s hand was frighteningly cold.

“”It’s, it’s nothing.””

Si Lu looked at Zhao Xueyin. “Let’s get into the car first.”

Zhao Xueyin and Si Lu got into the car.

“After getting into the car, Si Lu continued, “Xueyin, what exactly happened? Did Qian Zhuo Bully You?””

Zhao Xueyin did not say anything.

“The lawyer continued, “For a national player like Qian Zhuo, his temper is definitely different from that of a normal person. Now that we have something to ask of him, why don’t you bear with it?””

“”Big Brother Si.”Zhao Xueyin looked up at the lawyer. “Do you, do you know who Qian Zhuo is?””

“Who is Qian Zhuo?”The lawyer raised his head and asked.

Zhao Xueyin took a deep breath. “Ye Zhuo is Qian Zhuo.”

“What?”Si Lui’s expression changed. He thought he was hearing things.

Ye Zhuo was actually Qian Zhuo?

How was that possible!

“Zhao Xueyin’s eyes were red as she said, “Brother Si, you didn’t hear wrong! Qian Zhuo and ye Zhuo are the same person! Brother Si, Ye Zhuo is too outstanding. I Can’t defeat her... ... She’s still so young, but she has already achieved so much in both the technology and Design Worlds ... ..”

“”Not only in the technology and design worlds, but she also has a lot of business talent! Forget it! I’m completely convinced that I lost to someone like her!””

“At the end of her sentence, Zhao Xueyin almost burst into tears.”

The lawyer furrowed his brows tightly.

Never in his wildest dreams did he expect that ye Zhuo and Qian Zhuo were the same person.

Just hearing it like that made the lawyer find it hard to accept.

“Not to mention, Zhao Xueyin had experienced it herself.”

“Did ye Zhuo Bully You?”The lawyer asked.

“Zhao Xueyin shook her head, her eyes filled with self-mockery. “No, she didn’t bully me. I was asking for it!””

She didn’t?

How could she not!

It was clearly Zhao Xueyin who was kind and unwilling to say it out loud.

“Thinking of the grievances Zhao Xueyin had suffered in there, the lawyer felt very uncomfortable.”

He could not bear to see Zhao Xueyin suffer a little bit of grievance!

“After saying that, Zhao Xueyin continued, “Ye Zhuo is too amazing! I’m not her match at all. Big Brother Si, I might have to disappoint you all!””

“Si lui frowned tightly and continued, “Ye Zhuo is only 20 years old this year and has not even graduated from university yet. It’s impossible that she is just a shallow drinker! There must be a trick behind this!””

It was impossible for a normal person to achieve success in so many fields at the same time.

“Moreover, Ye Zhuo was a girl.”

Let alone a girl.

The identity of Ye Zhuo that had been exposed was something that many men could not achieve.

What right did ye Zhuo have?

With her face?

Therefore.

There must be a problem.

“Zhao Xueyin looked up at Si lui. “But if ye Zhuo isn’t Qian Zhuo, who is the real Qian Zhuo? Why can’t the real Qian Zhuo come out to see me?””

Si lui narrowed his eyes. “The real Qian Zhuo should be a man.”

Si Lui’s intuition had always been very accurate.

Even though he had never seen Qian Zhuo before.

But he could feel that Qian Zhuo was definitely a man. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“After all, What Ye Zhuo was best at was to rely on men to get to the top.”

“Although some men were very talented, they did not have much emotional intelligence. With just a few words from a woman, they could not even differentiate between north, south, east, and West!”
