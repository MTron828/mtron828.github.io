Only then did ye Shu react. “Hello!”

“”Hello, Child.”Elder Zhang held ye Shu’s hand. “Child, you look exactly like your mother when she was young.” ”

“Old Madam Lin looked at elder Zhang and then looked behind him. She asked curiously, “Why are you the only one here? Where’s Lang Hua?” ”

“After all, it was a joyous occasion for mother and daughter to reunite. How could a mother not come? ”

Could it be that ye Langhua was so happy that she fainted?

Elder Zhang Sighed and told Old Mrs. Lin what had happened.

“After listening to the whole process, old Mrs. Lin was very angry. “Let’s go to the XI family now!” ”

“Go to the Xi family for what?”Elder Zhang was stunned.

“”We’re going to the Xi family to get justice for Ah Shu!”Old Mrs. Lin continued, “Ah Shu is Lang Hua’s biological daughter, why should Xi Muwen get what he wants!” ”

“Those who were in the middle were confused, but those who were not were clear. ”

Old Mrs. Lin also understood ye Lang Hua. She felt that the current ye Lang Hua was the same person she was back then.

She needed someone to wake her up.

“”Okay, I’ll go with you!”Elder Zhang stood up and pushed Old Mrs. Lin’s wheelchair forward. ”

“Old Lady Lin turned to look at Ye Shu. “Ah Shu, wait at home! Don’t worry, we’ll be back soon!” ”

“Before ye Shu could say anything, the elder pushed Old Lady Lin’s wheelchair far away. ”

Lin Jincheng reached out and put his hand on ye Shu’s shoulder. “Just let them go. It’s been so long. Mom also wants to do something for you.”

“Okay.”Ye Shu nodded.

“Ye Sen frowned unhappily, “Ye Langhua is acting like my sister is going to throw herself at her!”! The paternity test was already out, but she still didn’t believe it! No wonder she was cheated so miserably 30 years ago! She learned from her mistakes. Why does she even have half a mind?” ”

“If it were anyone else, they would have fainted from joy when they finally found their daughter who had been lost for more than 30 years! ”

But Ye Langhua did not believe that ye Shu was her daughter!

This was ridiculous to the extreme!

“Ye Zhuo agreed with Ye Sen’s words, but she was still a junior, so it was not appropriate for her to interfere in such matters. ”

She was only responsible for investigating the ins and outs of the matter.

“Next, it was up to Ye Shu to decide. ”

“Lin Ze did not say anything either. He turned to look at ye Sen. “Uncle, shall we go upstairs?” ”

The rest of the time was left to Lin Jincheng and ye Shu to discuss.

“Okay.”Ye Sen nodded and followed Lin Ze’s footsteps.

The Lin family and XI family were an hour away by car.

“When the housekeeper came to look for Auntie Lang and said that the Lin family’s old lady was looking for her, Auntie Lang frowned slightly, but she did not refuse to meet her. She looked up at the housekeeper. “Go Tell Old Lady Lin to meet her at the nearby Lucky Star Teahouse.” ”

“Okay.”The housekeeper nodded.

“Hearing the conversation between Aunt Lang and the housekeeper, Jiang Yan walked over and said, “Mom, why don’t I go with you?” ”

“Aunt Lang shook her head and said, “You haven’t fully recovered yet. You should rest at home first.” ”

The main reason was that she did not want to let little half a month suffer any more grievances.

The Lin family’s old lady was a shrewd person. There was nothing good that could come out of her mouth.

“Alright then.”Jiang Yan nodded.

“After arriving at the Lucky Star Teahouse, Aunt Lang realized that it wasn’t just Old Lady Lin who had come. It was also elder Zhang. ”

“Seeing this scene, Aunt Lang had an idea. ”

It seemed that they had come because of the financial world.

“Aunt Lang walked over. “Elder Zhang, Old Lady Lin.” ”

“Old Lady Lin looked at Aunt Lang and said with a smile, “Lang Hua, speaking of which, we’re all on the same side. You can just call me by my name!” ”

“Aunt Lang smiled and sat opposite the two of them, “I know why you are here today. Elder Zhang, I have already told you many times that I will not return to the financial world. Moreover, I have already passed the recommendation letter to the lawyer. The lawyer has already brought Weiyue back to the financial world! Just give up on this idea!” ”

“Old Lady Lin Glanced at Aunt Lang, “Forty years ago, you were like this. Forty years later, you’re still like this! “Ask Elder Zhang, did he come to you because of the financial world? “He came to you because of half a month! “Since I’m here today, I won’t beat around the bush with you. My daughter-in-law, Ah Shu, is the real half a month, the fake XI family! It’s XI Muwen’s fake! You! Quickly wipe your eyes clean!” ”

“Seeing ye Langhua like this, old madam Lin could understand the Lin family from before. ” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Back then, they must have been like her now, wanting to slap ye Langhua awake. ”
