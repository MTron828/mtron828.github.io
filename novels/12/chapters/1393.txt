Translator: 549690339

“Hearing that Zhou Zuolong had misunderstood her, Zhou Xiang was very anxious and quickly explained, “Dad, I didn’t mean that. What I meant was that I came to pick up Wan Yin. Don’t worry, My Mom, she also welcomes Wan Yin very much.” ”

Mom?

“Zhou Xiang called Old Mrs. Cen ‘Mom’, both in words and in words, she was so protective of old Mrs. Cen. ”

“In his words, he had already treated old Mrs. Cen as his own mother. ”

What about Xie Wanqiu?

Zhou Xiang was not even this close to Xie wanqiu. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“One had to know that Zhou Xiang was raised by Xie wanqiu. If not for Xie wanqiu, would there be Zhou Xiang? ”

Ingrate!

Zhou Xiang was an ingrate!

“Zhou zuolong continued, “Zhou Xiang, ask yourself, are you that good to your own mother? That old woman from the Cen family, you’re so protective of her, you can’t even bear to let her come to the hospital! “Today, I’ll put my words here. If I don’t see that old woman from the Cen family come to the hospital personally to pick up yinyin, you’ll never be able to see Yinyin enter the CEN family.” ”

“Xie Wanqiu’s eyes were slightly red, “Old Man, don’t say that. Xiangxiang is also very good to me. After all, the Cen family’s old lady is her mother-in-law. They say that the relationship between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law is the most complicated and difficult to get along with. It’s also not easy for her to get along with her mother-in-law so well. I never blame Xiangxiang!” ”

“In front of Zhou Zuolong and Zhou Xiang, Xie wanqiu would always play the weak side. ”

“No matter what, she could win Zhou Zuolong’s sympathy. ”

“Otherwise, she would not have been able to control Zhou Zuolong steadily for so many years. ”

Zhou Zuolong pointed angrily at Zhou Xiang. “Look at how your mother treats you. Look at how you treat your mother!”

“The relationship between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law was so difficult to get along with. Zhou Xiang could get along so well with Old Lady Cen, but Zhou Xiang treated Xie Wanqiu so well. ”

Could it be that Xie wanqiu could not compare to Bai Tang’s mother-in-law?

Zhou Xiang was scolded until he could not even raise his head.

“Zhou zuolong continued, “Did you hear what I Said?” ”

“Zhou Xiang said, “I did. Father, it was all my fault in the past. Don’t worry. I will treat you and mother well in the future.” ”

“Zhou zuolong said, “Also, get that old woman from the Cen family to pick up yinyin. Did you hear that?” ”

“”Dad,”Zhou Xiang said with some difficulty, “Dad, you know my mother-in-law’s temper. She can’t come just because I asked her to.” ”

“This time, Zhou Xiang did not dare to call old Mrs. Cen ‘Mom’again. ”

“Unless the sun rose from the west, Old Mrs. Cen would only come to the hospital to pick up Zheng Wanyin. ”

“Otherwise, it was impossible! ”

“”You can think of a way yourself,”Zhou Zuolong said. “I just want to see the result!” ”

“”Dad!”Zhou Xiang looked like he was about to cry. “You, aren’t you making things difficult for me?” ”

“”To be able to marry such a good daughter-in-law like yinyin, the CEN family must have been blessed for countless lifetimes. If it wasn’t for your mother’s concern for you, do you think I would agree to this? You have to figure out who is making things difficult for whom? “The Cen family wants to marry such an outstanding daughter-in-law like yinyin, and they also want Yinyin to come knocking on their door. The Cen family doesn’t have to worry about anything. They just sit back and enjoy the fruits of their labor. How can there be such a good thing in the world?” ”

“It was also because Xie Wanqiu was kind-hearted. If it were any other stepmother, who would be willing to let their only granddaughter marry far away? ”

“Yet, Zhou Xiang and the Cen family still wanted more. ”

It was really disgusting.

“”Dad,”Zhou Xiang continued, “My mother-in-law really can’t come to the hospital. Please let me bring Wanyin Back!” ”

“Impossible!”Zhou Zuolong’s attitude was very firm.

“Zhou Xiang turned to look at Xie wanqiu. “Mom, please help persuade Dad.” ”

“Xie wanqiu sighed, “Xiang Xiang, although it seems like I’m in charge of our family on the surface, it’s actually your dad who makes the decisions. Even if I say it, your dad might not necessarily listen to me. Moreover, what your dad said is also right. We can’t let outsiders say that Yinyin is willing to sacrifice herself. “Yinyin is the only bloodline that Ying ‘ER has left. Your grandfather and I can’t bear to see yinyin suffer such injustice.” ”

How could Xie Wanqiu’s granddaughter be a pervert.

“If one were to say that she was a pervert, it would be the CEN family! ”

“If the Cen family was not the number one family in China, Cen Shaoqing would not be a match for Zheng Wanyin. ”

Zhou Xiang also sighed.

“Xie wanqiu continued, “Xiangxiang, don’t be anxious. Things will work out when they get to the end of the bridge. You get along so well with the old lady of the Cen family. Even though you are not a mother and daughter, you are better than them. I believe that she will definitely listen to you.” ”

“”This isn’t about getting along well or not getting along well. Mom, you don’t know my difficulties. If she doesn’t come, I can’t force her to come.” ”

Xie wanqiu rolled her eyes. “Then I’ll give you an idea.”

“”Go Ahead,”Zhou Xiang said. ”

“Xie wanqiu continued, “Crying, making a scene, and hanging yourself. You’re the only daughter-in-law of the CEN family, and Haifeng left early. Don’t tell me that the old lady of the Cen family Will Just Watch You Die?” ”

Of course not!

Zhou Xiang was stunned. “Is... is this okay?”

“According to Old Lady Cen’s personality, if she dared to use hanging to threaten her, Old Lady Cen would definitely hand her a rope. ”

“If she jumped off a building, old lady cen might even feel that she wasn’t jumping fast enough. ”

“Therefore, crying, making a scene, and hanging herself three times were completely useless to Old Lady Cen! ”

“Having been with Old Lady Cen’s mother-in-law for so many years, Zhou Xiang knew Old Lady Cen’s personality too well. ”

“”Why not?”Xie wanqiu said, “Xiangxiang, yinyin is your biological niece. Could it be that you’re not willing to do such a small thing for her?” ”

“These words were a little harsh. Zheng Wanyin was not related to Zhou Xiang in the first place. If word got out, outsiders would think that she was mistreating her niece. ”

“Zhou Xiang said, “Mom, that’s not what I meant. I just feel that this method might not be feasible.” ”

“”I think you just don’t take Yinyin as your biological niece.”Zhou Zuolong turned to look at Zhou Xiang, then he said, “Don’t forget how Ying ‘er died! If it wasn’t for you, would Ying ‘ER have died? If it wasn’t for you, would yinyin have become an orphan without parents?” ”

“If Zhou Xiang had not interfered, Xie Ying would have been the one who married Cen Haifeng. ”

“If Xie Ying had married Cen Haifeng, Zheng Wanyin would have been the Cen family’s eldest daughter. ”

Zhou Xiang felt wronged when she mentioned this matter.

“She was the one who knew Cen Haifeng first, and she was the one who was dating Cen Haifeng. When Xie Ying found out about this, she wanted to replace her, but she couldn’t. She felt resentful and twisted the truth, she lied to Zhou Zuolong and Xie wanqiu that she was the one who was in a relationship with Cen Haifeng. ”

This led Zhou Zuolong and Xie Wanqiu to believe that Xie Ying’s death was her fault all these years.

Little did they know that she was also a victim.

“Now that Xie Ying was already dead, the dead were the most important. She could not argue with a dead person about right and wrong. ”

“Zhou zuolong continued, “Zhou Xiang, unless you want to sever your father-daughter relationship with me, otherwise, let that old lady of yours come over!” ”

“Dad...”

“Xie wanqiu held Zhou Xiang’s arm. “Okay, okay, Xiang Xiang, your dad is tired. You should go back quickly and let your dad have a good rest.”As Xie Wanqiu spoke, she brought Zhou Xiang outside. ”

“When they came outside, Xie wanqiu lowered her voice and said, “Xiang Xiang, it’s not like you don’t know your dad’s personality. He’s exactly the same as Jin bei. You have to go along with what he says. You Can’t go against him!” ”

“”But mom, I really can’t do anything to my mother-in-law. What if my mother-in-law doesn’t come?”Zhou Xiang said. ”

“”Human actions matter. As long as you think of a way, your mother-in-law will definitely come.”Xie wanqiu continued, “I know of a medicine that won’t really kill you after you drink it, but it will be very scary. Although you may suffer some pain, you have to let your mother-in-law see your determination. Moreover, yinyin is your biological niece. You know how outstanding she is. If your mother-in-law is unhappy now, she will definitely thank you in the future. So, you don’t have to worry at all!” ”

“After all, Zheng Wanyin was the only one who could save the Cen family from disaster. ”

“Unless old Madam Cen was a fool, she would definitely be very grateful to Zhou Xiang. ”

Zhou Xiang frowned.

“Xie wanqiu secretly slipped a bottle of medicine into Zhou Xiang’s hands, “Xiangxiang, do you really want to sever the relationship between father and son with your father? “Shaoqing is not an ordinary person, and the Cen family is not a small family in the capital. If word gets out, it will not be good for you, Shaoqing, or the CEN family!” ”

Zhou Xiang’s heart skipped a beat when he heard this.

Xie Wanqiu was right.

“There were many disputes in the powerful family. Moreover, CEN Shaoqing stood high up. If something really happened, outsiders would not know how to discuss it! ”

“Xie wanqiu saw Zhou Xiang’s expression. “Xiangxiang, you are a smart child. I think you should know what to do, right?” ”
