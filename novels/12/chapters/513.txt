“Ye Zhuo saw through ye Shu’s worries. “Mom, you don’t know what to choose?” ”

Ye Shu looked at Ye Zhuo and nodded.

“”Just follow your heart.”Ye Zhuo smiled, “Don’t feel pressured. No matter what choice you make, I will support you! “If you don’t want to accept him, then we can continue living our lives. We don’t have to look at each other’s opinions. We can still live well without them! “If you are willing to accept him, then I will be very happy to have a brother and a father.” ”

Ye Shu now lacked a spiritual guide.

“Otherwise, she would forever be trapped in her inner world, in a dilemma. ”

“Ye Shu did not expect ye Zao to be so calm. She asked in surprise, “Zao Zao, do you really think so?” ”

“Ye Zao nodded with a smile. “Of course. When have I ever lied? It’s because you think things are too complicated.”After saying that, Ye Zao looked at ye Sen. “Uncle, do you want to have a big nephew?” ”

Ye Sen nodded. “Ah Ze is quite good. I like him very much.”

“Ye Zao bit the straw and turned to look at Ye Shu, “Mom, life is so long. No matter what, we should live for ourselves. There are all kinds of things in this world, but there is no medicine for regret. “No matter what choice you make, as long as you don’t regret it in the future, it’s the best choice!” ”

“Hearing that, Ye Sen immediately gave ye Zao a thumbs up. ”

That’s great!

This niece of his could always remain so clear-headed no matter what.

“Ye Zao’s words woke her up from her dream, and Ye Shu instantly felt much more relaxed. ”

She thought that she already had the answer in her heart.

“”Thank you, Zao Zao.”Ye Shu walked over and hugged ye Zao. ”

“Although ye Zao was not old and was still a child in her teens, most of the time, she was wiser than an adult with rich social experience! ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Mom, you didn’t Sleep well last night. After breakfast, go to sleep. Don’t think about the rest and just follow your heart.” ”

Ye Shu nodded and smiled.

...

Three days passed quickly.

“Early in the morning, Lin Jincheng brought Lin Ze to the ye family with flowers in his hands. ”

“”Mom.”Lin Ze was not a talkative person. In the Lin family, he could keep not calling Old Mrs. Lin for a day, but when he saw ye Shu, he could not control himself. ”

Calling her ‘Mom’was almost subconscious.

“”Ah Ze.”Seeing Lin ze again, ye Shu’s eyes reddened. ”

Nineteen years.

They had been separated for nineteen years.

“Before this, she didn’t even know that she had a son in this world. ” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Lin Ze walked over and hugged ye Shu.

“Seeing the mother and son like this, Lin Jincheng felt a little uncomfortable. He turned his head to look at the other side and tried to hold back his tears. ”

“Ye Zhuo walked out of the kitchen with milk in his hands. “Dad, brother, you haven’t had breakfast yet, right? Sit Down and have breakfast with us first.” ”

At this moment.

Lin Jincheng was stunned.

Lin Ze was also stunned.

No one had expected ye Zhuo to suddenly change his words.

She had clearly not shown how much she welcomed them the last time they were at the Ye family home.

Lin Jincheng could not help but tear up.

Ye Sen walked in from behind and patted Lin Jincheng on the shoulder. “Don’t Cry! How can a grown man always cry like that? Let’s eat. Let’s talk after we finish eating.”

“”Yes, yes.”Lin Jincheng smiled and said, “Let’s eat. Let’s eat first.” ”

The family of five sat together and ate.

“This was clearly the first time their family had sat at the same table to eat. However, that kind of tacit understanding made them feel like family members who had lived for many years. ”

“Lin Jincheng picked up an egg and slowly peeled the shell. Then, he ate the egg yolk and put all the egg whites into ye Shu’s bowl. ”

“When he was with Ye Shu, Ye Shu was still a little picky eater. ”

“She didn’t eat ginger, carrots, onions, or egg yolks. Every time, he ate the egg yolk. ”

He looked at the egg whites in the bowl.

It would be a lie to say that ye Shu didn’t feel anything at all.

She didn’t expect that Lin Jincheng would still remember her childhood habits after so many years.

“If it weren’t for Lin Jincheng, she might have forgotten that she used to be picky with her food. ”

“After dinner, Lin Jincheng took the initiative to clear the table and wash the dishes. ”

Ye Shu walked to his side. “There’s a dishwasher at home. Just put it in The Dishwasher.”
