Chapter 1385: 285: so angry that his face changed

Translator: 549690339

“Hearing this, Old Zhang almost couldn’t believe his ears.”

He also couldn’t believe that the person standing in front of him was Zhou Jinbei.

What nonsense was Zhou Jinbei saying?

“What he meant was, he had already found someone who could repair the will?”

“But in all of China, besides Dr. William, who else could have this ability.”

“Not to mention China, even country C and several other countries could not find such a person.”

“”Brother Zhou, do you know what you are talking about!”Old Zhang continued, “Now hurry up and apologize to Dr. William, and ask the doctor not to lower himself to your level! The Doctor is magnanimous. As long as you sincerely apologize, he will definitely forgive you!””

“I know very well what I am doing. You want me to apologize to him? In Your Next Life!”

“After saying this, Zhou Jinbei turned around and left.”

“Old Zhang immediately chased after him. “Zhou Jinbei, you will regret it!””

“Just as Old Zhang was about to say something else, doctor William Gently raised his hand. “There’s no need to chase after him.””

“Doctor?”Old Zhang looked up at Doctor William.

“Dr. William continued, “Don’t worry. He’ll be back to look for me in less than three days.””

Dr. William’s information network was very wide.

“At present, China did not have a sophisticated machine that could repair letters, so even he was only 50 percent sure.”

And he had the most advanced technology in the world.

“In terms of technology, China could only rank in the top 20 in the world.”

It was 19 places behind.

“Although in last year’s science and Technology Competition, Dr. YC became the Dark Horse of the world and won the first place.”

But that was only Dr. YC alone.

How could Dr. YC single-handedly drive the entire technology of China?

“Now, Zhou Jinbei swore that he had found someone who could repair the letters. It was obvious that he had been deceived.”

Could it be that Zhou Jinbei could still find Dr. YC?

It was impossible! !

“Dr. YC’s whereabouts were mysterious. At the moment, he had only shown his face at the science and Technology Conference. Most importantly, Dr. YC was currently busy implementing the aircraft carrier plan.”

She had no time to care about Zhou Jinbei at all.

“Therefore, Zhou Jinbei could only come back to beg him in the end.”

Old Zhang nodded.

“Professor William narrowed his eyes and continued, “At that time, it won’t be as simple as asking for all the assets under Zhou Jinbei’s name.””

“What else do you want?”Old Zhang asked doubtfully.

“One of his hands.”A light flashed in Professor William’s eyes.

One Hand?

Old Zhang gulped. “You... You’re joking.”

Professor William turned to look at Old Zhang. “You Think I’m joking with You?”

Old Zhang felt that he had misunderstood professor William’s meaning. He couldn’t really ask Zhou Jinbei to use one hand. This was too bloody!

“After thinking for a moment, old zhang said tactfully, “Then do you want his left hand or his right hand?””

“Right hand.”

Old Zhang’s face turned pale. This professor William was really serious!

“Professor William operated the keyboard and continued, “Isn’t there an old saying in your country, ‘kill the chicken to make an example of the monkey’? I want one of his hands to let others know that I, William, am not the kind of person who can be easily fooled!””

“Old Zhang wiped the cold sweat off his forehead. “Alright, I got it.””

“Professor William continued, “You can go down first. If there’s anything, I’ll call you.””

Beijing University.

In the chemistry department’s laboratory.

“A person wearing a white protective suit was standing in front of him doing an experiment. At this moment, the counselor ran over and said, “Student Ye, someone is looking for you.””

Ye Zhuo placed the glass tube in his hand on the shelf. “Who is it?” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“The counselor thought for a moment and said, “He said he’s Zhou Jinbei.””

“Ye Zhuo picked up another green glass tube. “Counselor, my experiment will be over in 10 minutes. Please go out and let my uncle wait for a moment.””

“He’s also your uncle.”The counselor was stunned.

Because he had seen ye Sen before.

But Ye Sen did not look like this.

Ye Zao nodded slightly. “He’s my boyfriend’s uncle.”

“”Okay, I’ll go now.””

“The counselor trotted to the office and said with a smile, “Uncle, please wait a moment. Student Ye will be out in 10 minutes.””

“Zhou Jinbei said in surprise, “How did you know that I’m Ye Zhuo’s uncle?””

“The counselor explained, “Student ye said so. By the way, uncle, what would you like to drink? Green tea or coffee?””

The counselor was so enthusiastic that Zhou Jinbei was not used to it.

“Zhou Zeyan was a troublemaker. Every time the counselor called him, he would complain, causing him to have to bow down to the counselor every time he went to school.”
