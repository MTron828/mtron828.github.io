S galaxy.

“Bai Mo contacted Chen Yaosheng, wanting to ask him if he had succeeded. However, he realized that he could not contact Chen Yaosheng no matter what. ”

It was as if Chen Yaosheng had vanished from the face of the Earth.

Bai Mo frowned tightly.

That shouldn’t be.

“”Mo Mo!”At this moment, Bai Yuanyuan’s voice sounded in the air. ”

Bai Mo turned around. “What’s Wrong?”

“Bai Yuanyuan continued, “I heard that man Wen is going to Lzhou today. Do you want to go over and take a look?” ”

“How did you know?”Bai Mo asked.

“”I bought the news with money. It’s 50% true,”Bai Yuanyuan told the truth. ”

50% true...

“Hearing this, Bai Mo hesitated. ”

“”Momo, if you go, I’ll go with you.” ”

“Okay.”Bai Mo nodded.

“She could ask about Chen Yaosheng later, but she and Manwen’s matter could not be delayed. ”

The two of them took the aircraft and came to L continent.

Manwen was here to inspect the work.

“He had just taken office, so it was inevitable that he would deceive his superiors and subordinates. ”

“No matter what, it was always the same. What he heard was false, and what he saw was true. ”

Bai Mo stood where she was and looked at Manwen with narrowed eyes.

It seemed like the news was right.

Man Wen had indeed come.

Bai Mo turned to look at Bai Yuan Yuan. “You can go back first. There’s no need to wait for me.”

“Ah?”Bai Yuan Yuan was stunned.

“Bai Mo repeated, “You go back first.” ”

Bai Yuan Yuan was a little prettier than her.

“Men were all visual animals, and beauty and ugliness were all compared. ”

She could not let herself be a threat.

“Therefore, Bai Yuanyuan couldn’t stay any longer. ”

“OH.”Bai Yuanyuan nodded. She was more or less unwilling to accept this. She felt that Bai Mo was trying to burn the bridge after crossing it.

“Bai Mo adjusted her expression and smiled appropriately. She walked to man Wen’s side and said, “Brother Man Wen, what a coincidence! I really didn’t expect to meet you here!” ”

Man Wen was stunned when he saw Bai Mo. he was a little stunned.

Who Was She?

“Bai Mo saw the confusion in man Wen’s heart and continued, “I’m Bai Mo! Bai Jingshu is my cousin!” ”

It would be a lie to say that she didn’t mind.

“They had clearly known each other before, but man Wen didn’t remember who she was! ”

What was this?

“She was so much more outstanding than Bai Jingshu, so why didn’t Man Wen remember her? ”

This was an insult to her!

Only then did Manwen remember. “Hello.” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Bai Mo continued, “Brother Manwen, is my sister not with you today?” ”

“”No,”Manwen said. ”

“”OH.”Bai Mo nodded and said with some hesitation, “Brother Manwen, I... I... Can I ask you something?” ”

“What is it?”Manwen asked.

“Bai Mo continued, “My aircraft is broken. Can I trouble brother Manwen to give me a ride?” ”

“Is the flying machine broken?”Man Wen asked.

“Yes.”Bai Mo nodded.

“Man Wen continued, “Get Someone to fix it for you. I still have something to do.” ”

“”I don’t know anyone here.”Bai Mo looked delicate and weak. “Brother Man Wen, I only know you...” ”

“”I have the phone number of the repairman here. They are online all day long. I will ask the Secretary to give you the contact information in a while,”man Wen said. ”

“”I’m... I’m a little scared, Brother Man Wen. This is the first time I’ve traveled so far by myself!” ”

Man Wen rubbed the space between his eyebrows impatiently.

“He had been in the dungeon for a long time, so he naturally knew what Bai Mo was planning. ”

“However, since she was Bai Jingshu’s cousin, he couldn’t act out directly. ”

“At this moment, Bai Mo accidentally dropped the communicator in her hand on the ground and immediately bent down to pick it up. ”

“When she bent down, she accidentally exposed her ample bosom. ”

“Bai Mo immediately raised her hand to cover her chest, her face flushed red. ”

“Manwen must have seen it just now, right? ”

He must have seen it.

Weren’t those the few things that men cared about?

Face and chest.

“Bai Mo raised her head with a red face and ears. She originally thought that she could see Manwen’s similarly bashful face, but who knew that not only did Bai Mo not see Manwen’s bashful face, she did not even see Manwen’s figure. ”

Where was Manwen?

“Bai Mo frowned slightly, and her entire person instantly felt bad. She had thought that she could let Manwen see the fullness that she was so proud of. ”

Who knew that Manwen would actually leave!

Where did Manwen go?

“Bai Mo was so angry that she stomped her feet, but she could not find any outlet to vent her anger. ”

“At this moment, the sound of footsteps came from behind. ”

Manwen must have come!

“Bai Mo immediately returned to her gentle and generous appearance, turned around and looked back. “Manwen...” ”

“When she saw the person who had come, the rest of her words stopped abruptly. ”

“Because the person who had come was not man Wen at all, but someone else! ”

“”Excuse me, is this Miss Bai?” ”

“”I am,”Bai Mo said. ”
