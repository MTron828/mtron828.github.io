Translator: 549690339

It can be repaired!

Ye Zao said it can be repaired!

“Hearing this answer, Zhou Jinbei was ecstatic. ”

“After waiting for so many years, he finally got this result. ”

“This time, he didn’t have to beg that Dr. William anymore. ”

“”Really?”Zhou jinbei continued, “My Nephew’s wife, can you really repair this letter?” ”

“Ye Zao nodded slightly. “From the photo, there shouldn’t be any problem. However, because you don’t have the original, the repair time might be a little longer. Uncle, are you waiting to use it?” ”

“What if there’s an original?”Zhou Jinbei immediately asked.

“Ye Zao Thought for a moment. “If there’s an original, it’ll probably take about a week.” ”

A week!

“Hearing this answer, Zhou Jinbei did not know what to say. He thought that ye Zhuo would say that it would take about three to four months, but he did not expect that a week would be enough, “That’s great. So, in a week, I will be able to see the letter that has been successfully restored?” ”

“Ye Zhuo looked up at Zhou Jinbei and continued, “Uncle, do you have the original?” ”

“Yes.”Zhou Jinbei quickly nodded.

“”Then you’ll be able to see it in a week. If you’re lucky, you might even be able to see it ahead of time.”It was not difficult to repair the letter, but it required precise equipment. In this world, many equipment could not keep up with it, ye Zhuo could not be too precise about the time. ”

“”Thank you, great nephew’s wife! Thank you!”Zhou Jinbei was very excited now. ”

“Although ye Zao did not look big, the aura around him was not something that an ordinary person could have. Even as an elder, standing in front of ye Zao, he felt that he was more than a head shorter. ”

“In addition, Zhou Jinbei had just witnessed ye Zao’s ability. ”

Turning an ordinary wristwatch into a small laptop.

This ability was something that even professor William did not have.

“Therefore, Zhou Jinbei firmly believed in ye Zao. ”

“Ye Zao slowly put the wristwatch on his wrist and said with a smile, “It’s not too late for you to thank me after I have successfully restored the envelope.” ”

“”Eldest nephew’s wife, I believe in you. You can definitely restore it successfully,”Zhou Jinbei continued, “Tomorrow, I will bring the original to you tomorrow!” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Old Mrs. Cen asked curiously, “Brother-in-law, is that letter very important to you?” ”

“”It’s important, very important.”Zhou Jinbei rubbed his eyes. “It’s more important than my life!” ”

“If he had not met ye Zao, he would definitely have agreed to Dr. William’s conditions. ”

“Even if he had to go bankrupt, he had to repair the will and restore the truth of that incident. ”

He could not let his mother suffer such grievance.

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “What is the letter about?” ”

“Zhou Jinbei said, “You’ll know when it’s restored.” ” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Old Mrs. Cen nodded and did not ask further.

“Zhou Xiang came out with a fruit plate. “Jinbei, what are you guys talking about?” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen was about to speak when Zhou Jinbei spoke before her. “SIS, it’s nothing. We’re just talking about common things.” ”

“”Yes, yes, yes.”Old Mrs. Cen could tell that Zhou Jinbei might not want Zhou Xiang to know about this, so she nodded in agreement. ”

“Zhou Xiang did not think too much about it. She placed the fruit plate on the coffee table. “Everyone, eat your fruits. The Lotus Mist that just arrived today is especially sweet.” ”

Cen Shaoqing picked up the lotus mist and ate it slowly.

“Ye Zhuo raised his head and asked, “Is it delicious?” ”

“The Lotus Mist looked very good. It was so red that it was tempting, but the taste... ... He really did not dare to compliment it. ”

“Ye Zao did not have a long memory. Every time he took a bite, he would despise it. However, every time he saw the lotus mist, he could not help but take a bite. ”

“Cen Shaoqing was fine by the side. If she could not finish it, she would throw it to Cen Shaoqing. If Cen Shaoqing was not around, she could only bite down and finish the Lotus Mist. ”

“Ye Zao had experienced hardship before. She had experienced the hardship of not having food. Therefore, no matter how terrible the food was, as long as she took a bite, she would insist on finishing it. ”

“Cen Shaoqing tilted his head slightly. “In your words, it’s eating grass.” ”

Eating Grass?

“What’s the taste of Grass?”Ye Zao once again forgot the taste of the Lotus Mist.

Cen Shaoqing handed the Lotus Mist that he had taken a bite of to Ye Zao. “Try it.”

Ye Zao took a bite.

“After the red skin was bitten open, there was a white fruit pulp. It was very watery, and there was a hint of sweetness in the fragrance. Then, there was a strong smell of green grass. ”

“You should eat it yourself.”Ye Zao frowned in disdain. “How can there be such an awful fruit in the world?”
