“Looking at the girl standing in front of her, Zhang Qingqing felt a great sense of oppression. She almost couldn’t breathe. It was very depressing. ”

“But when she thought about how this person in front of her was about to become her sister, the aunt of the child in her belly, Zhang Qingqing felt much better. ”

So what if ye Zao was powerful?

She would still have to call her sister-in-law in the future!

“Zhang Qingqing calmed herself down and smiled appropriately. “I’m Zhang Qingqing. You’re Lin Ze’s sister, right? Please take a seat!” ”

“Ye Zao must have come to look for her out of the blue because he was concerned about her. After all, she was pregnant with Lin Ze’s child. Her child would be the future heir of the Lin Family! ”

How could ye Zao Not Care?

Ye Zao leaned over and sat opposite Zhang Qingqing. There was no expression on his face.

Only then did Zhang Qingqing see ye Zao’s face clearly.

It would be a lie to say that she was not shocked!

“Beautiful. She was really too beautiful. Up Close, there was almost no blemish on ye Zao’s face. ”

“It had to be said that the genes of the Lin family were really too good. Lin Ze was so handsome, and Ye Zao was so beautiful. This brother and sister pair were like dragons and phoenixes among men. ”

“Zhang Qingqing subconsciously touched her belly. In the future, her child would definitely be born like dragons and phoenixes among men! ”

“Thinking of this, the corners of Zhang Qingqing’s lips curled up. Her heart was filled with joy. ”

“Three generations of her family were born as ordinary workers. In her generation, she was finally going to turn things around! ”

“I heard that you’re Pregnant?”Ye Zao raised his eyes slightly.

“Yes.”Zhang Qingqing nodded.

“How long has it been?”Ye Zao continued to ask.

“Ye Zao clearly did not say anything, but Zhang Qingqing was a little nervous. This kind of nervousness came from the depths of her heart, and she almost could not control it. ”

“”One, one month,”Zhang Qingqing replied. ”

“The corners of Ye Zao’s mouth curled slightly, and his eyes deepened. “Are you sure it’s not two months?” ”

Two months?

Zhang Qingqing’s face turned pale.

Could it be that ye Zao had seen through something?

No!

It couldn’t be!

Ye Zao was just a little girl. What did she know?

He was definitely trying to trick her! Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Did he really think that she was that easy to trick?

“Zhang Qingqing narrowed her eyes, she smiled and said, “Little sister, look at what you’re saying. Two months ago, your brother and I hadn’t developed to this extent! How could we possibly be pregnant! If you don’t believe me, I have a report here. Just take a look and you’ll know!” ”

“As Zhang Qingqing spoke, she took out the report. ”

“Anyway, she had a report, so what was there to be afraid of! ! ”

“Did you wake up in the morning and look in the Mirror?”Ye Zao picked up his cup and took a sip of coffee. He raised his head to look at Zhang Qingqing and asked.

Did you wake up and look in the mirror?

Zhang Qingqing was stunned for a moment. She didn’t quite understand the meaning behind ye Zao’s words.

“Ye Zao opened his red lips and continued, “If you didn’t look in the mirror, you could still look in the mirror now! With your low-end green tea, do you think you are worthy to be my sister-in-law?” ”

Zhang Qingqing’s heart turned cold. She thought that ye Zao was here to care for her and give her warmth. Who knew that ye Zao was here to insult her!

Don’t you know that pregnant people can’t be angry?

What if it affects the fetus?

“”You! What are you talking about!”Zhang Qingqing stood up from the chair, with red eyes, she said, “I know that you rich people look down on us poor people! But what I am carrying is indeed your brother’s flesh and blood! You Can Insult Me, but you can’t insult my child! The child is innocent!” ”

“”Speak, whose child is it!”Ye Zao couldn’t be bothered to put on an act with Zhang Qingqing. ”

Ye Zao had been a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner for many years and his medical skills were superb. He could almost tell at a glance that Zhang Qingqing’s pregnancy cycle was more than one month.

A hospital report was nothing at all.

“As long as she wanted to, she could get a pregnancy report for ten months, let alone one month. ”

“Just from the report alone, she wanted to pin this child on Lin Ze. Zhang Qingqing was too naive! ”

Zhang Qingqing was panicking. She did not understand why ye Zao would say something like that. She tried her best to calm herself down. “The child is your brother’s!”

“”Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly and stood up from the chair. “You’re not going to say it, right? I naturally have a way to find out.” ”

“After saying this, ye Zao turned around and left. ”

Find out.

Did Ye Zao really have a way to find out?

Zhang Qingqing gulped and chased after ye Zao’s back. “Sister! Sister!”

Ye Zao looked back slightly. “I’ve said it before. You’re not qualified to be my sister-in-law!”

“Zhang Qingqing continued, “Since you don’t like it, then I won’t call you sister! “Miss Ye, please believe me. The child in my stomach is really your brother’s flesh and blood, your future nephew! “If you don’t believe me, you can ask Lizi. Lizi can testify for me! “I’ve said before that you can not let your brother take responsibility. It was your brother who decided to marry me!” ”
