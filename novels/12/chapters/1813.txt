Ye Zhuo’s alcohol tolerance was not bad.

“Unfortunately, her parents and Cen Shaoqing usually did not allow her to drink. ”

“Li Yueyue was a well-behaved girl at home and did not drink much. When she heard that ye Zhuo was going to drink, her eyes immediately lit up and she temporarily forgot about her sadness. “Where are we going?” ”

“Ye Zhuo took out his phone and continued, “There’s a Qing bar nearby. Do you want to go take a look?” ”

“Bar?”Li Yueyue asked. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Ye zhuo nodded slightly, “It’s considered a kind of bar! But Qing bar is a leisure bar. The environment is much more elegant than a bar.”It was not as mixed as a bar. ”

“After saying that, ye Zhuo continued, “Do you want to go?” ”

“”Yes, yes!”Li Yueyue nodded hurriedly. ”

“Then let’s go.”Ye Zhuo reached out and opened the door of the passenger seat.

Li Yueyue sat in the passenger seat.

Ye Zao went to the other side and sat in the passenger seat.

Ye Zao’s favorite music was playing in the car.

“”... the rain of falling flowers, your swaying beauty, the fragrance of the flowers, bring back the love of the past, turn into duckweed and lie in the middle of the lake...” ”

“Li Yueyue asked curiously, “What Song Is This? It’s so nice to listen to!” ”

“Ye Zao said with a proud face, “Of course, how can my Prince Charming’s song not be nice to listen to?” ”

This song was the first song ye Zao heard after he came to this world.

“In the future, he would be unable to extricate himself! ”

“Most importantly, the singer’s personality was also very charming! ”

“Hearing this, Li Yueyue said in surprise, “Da Zao Zao, you actually have a Prince Charming too!”She thought that ye Zao’s Prince Charming was Cen Shaoqing! ”

She did not expect that ye Zao’s Prince Charming was actually a singer.

“Of course I have a Prince Charming!”Ye Zao said.

“Does master five know?”Li Yueyue followed up with a question.

“”Take a guess,”ye Zao said. ”

“Li Yueyue smiled and said, “I guess he definitely doesn’t know.” ”

“Although she did not have much contact with Cen Shaoqing, Li Yueyue could tell that Cen Shaoqing was a very insidious and black-bellied person. ”

“If he knew that ye Zao actually had a Prince Charming behind his back, he would probably die of jealousy. ”

Ye Zao smiled and did not say anything.

“In fact, Cen Shaoqing really did not know anything about her Prince Charming. ”

“”Oh Right, Zao Zao, what’s the name of this song?”Li Yueyue continued to ask. ”

“Ye Zao said, “Between the mountains and the rivers.” ”

“Unlike other singers, her Prince Charming had a unique style. He was his own style and was filled with imagination and speculation that surpassed reality. He had a very unique personality charm. ”

“Li Yueyue immediately opened the music app, searched for the name of the song, and added the song list. ”

“After adding the song list, Li Yueyue suddenly saw a song from the song list. ”

“Golden Mao Ling, Yau Tsim Mong. ”

“This was a very unpopular song. There were only three to four hundred comments on the music app. If it wasn’t for Ouyang Nai’s introduction, she might never have known that such a good song existed in the world. ”

“When she recommended this song, Ouyang Nai was still her boyfriend. ”

Now...

“Thinking of Ouyang Nai, Li Yueyue’s expression became a little sad. ”

“Seeing the change in Li Yueyue’s expression from the rearview mirror, ye Zhuo continued, “Has Ouyang Nai broken up with You?” ”

“”Not yet,”li yueyue continued, “But it’s no different from breaking up.” ”

“Looking at Ouyang Nai’s performance when she answered the video, she knew that he looked down on her from the bottom of his heart. ”

“Ye Zhuo held the steering wheel with one hand and patted Li Yueyue’s shoulder with one hand. “I can’t find two-legged toads. Two-legged men are everywhere. The Old Ones won’t go, and the new ones won’t come.” ”

“Okay.”Li Yueyue nodded.

“At this moment, Li Yueyue’s phone rang. ”

She picked up the phone and saw that it was a message from Ouyang Nai.

“[ Li Yueyue, I don’t think we are suitable for each other. Let’s break up. ] ”

“Although she knew why Ouyang Nai wanted to break up, Li Yueyue was still a little angry. She replied, [ why? What’s not suitable? If it’s not suitable, why did you come to provoke me in the first place? ] ”

“Ouyang Nai had spent almost two months chasing her. After being together with her, she broke up with Ouyang Nai in less than half a month. ”

What was this?

“Li Yueyue had grown up on the grassland and had always had a bad temper. When she saw the message from Ouyang Nai, she wanted to jump out of the screen and give Ouyang Nai a few tight slaps. ”

Why?

“Ouyang nai frowned slightly. From Li Yueyue’s tone, it seemed that she did not want to break up with him! ”

That’s right!

“He was so well-off. His parents were high-level executives, had a house and car in the capital, and had a local household registration. Not to mention Li Yueyue, any other girl would probably be reluctant to break up with him! ”

“However, Li Yueyue did not even look at her status. She was the daughter of a herdsman, yet she wanted to climb up to him? ”
