Chapter 53: I’ll Carry You

If this was considered bad business, what was theirs?

Extremely bad?

Non-existent?

In fact, He Fengxian was also very speechless!

She couldn’t even believe the scene in front of her eyes.

What on Earth is going on?

Why was Ye Family’s Private Kitchen doing so well? It was so far away from anywhere else, where did these people come from?

He Fengxian’s back was covered in a layer of cold sweat. Her heart was filled with mixed feelings—jealousy, envy, and an indescribable feeling.

“Fengxian, I’m asking you a question! Is this really Ye Family’s Private Kitchen?”

“Yes.” He Fengxian nodded with difficulty.

Although she didn’t want to admit it, this really was Ye Family’s Private Kitchen.

Right at that moment, Ye Shu stepped out of the restaurant. She was taking out the trash. When she saw He Fengxian, she took the initiative to greet her. “Big Sister He, I’m busy now, so I won’t invite you in for a chat.”

He Fengxian squeezed out a stiff smile. “Y-Yes, I can see that you’re busy! Go ahead. Your business is more important.” She had originally come to see Ye Shu to laugh at her, but unexpectedly, she was the one who ended up embarrassed instead.

“Let’s go back.” He Fengxian pulled Big sister Li away.

Big Sister Li asked curiously, “Why do you think her family’s business is so good? On this street, other than the one selling crayfish, I think her family’s business is the best!”

He Fengxian felt very uncomfortable. It was clearly a store with an extremely poor location, so why was business so good?

She did not know what methods the mother and daughter had used.

It was really infuriating!

Big Sister Li continued, “Do you think Zhang Ji’s Stewed Pork Rice would die of anger if she knew that Ye Family’s Private Kitchen was doing so well?”

Hearing this, He Fengxian’s eyes lit up.

‘That’s right! I shouldn’t feel bad. The one who should be feeling bad right now is Zhang Ji’s Stewed Pork Rice.

‘If Zhang Ji’s Stewed Pork Rice knew that the shop lot they sold was not a trash location but a place with good feng shui, she would definitely regret it so much that her intestines would turn green!’

Thinking this, He Fengxian said, “That goes without saying! She will definitely die of anger!”

After returning, He fengxian thought of a way to let Zhang Ji next door know about this matter.

When the aunt who had sold the shop lot to Ye Zhuo heard the news, she was in disbelief.

At that time, the store’s business didn’t fare too well because the location was too remote. That was why she decided to sell the shop lot. How long has it been since Ye Zhuo bought it over?

It had not even been half a month, and her business was already faring so well?

‘Could it be fake news?’ ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The aunt decided to go out and find out the truth. After announcing it her family, the aunt headed over to Ye Family’s Private Kitchen.

When she saw the restaurant, the aunt was completely dumbfounded. The was a long queue outside of the restaurant!

“Oh my God!” The aunt exclaimed and rubbed her eyes a few times in disbelieve, but the scene in front of her did not change.

It was real!

When Ye Zhuo had bought over the shop, the aunt had even silently mocked Ye Zhuo for being a fool, and that she would definitely lose money.

This was like a slap that to her face, and it had come so quickly! If she had known that this was a good place with good feng shui, she would not have sold it!

The aunt regretted it so much! An indescribable feeling rose in her heart. This good business should’ve belonged to her and her family! However now, Ye Zhuo was the one benefitting from it!

In the shop, Ye Zhuo and Ye Shu were busy working.

Fortunately, the rabbit heads were braised in advance, and the hotpot seasoning was processed in advance, so there was no need to process it on the spot. Otherwise, they would really be too busy.

After the night shift ended, Ye Shu checked her accounts and found that the returns for the day was double of the amount they had earned yesterday!

“Zhuo Zhuo, we made 6,000 yuan today!”

Ye Zhuo smiled and looked back at her mother. “Mom, I told you, our business will get better and better.”

Ye Shu was really happy to have more hope every day. Even her complexion was much better than before.

…

The next day, Chen Xiaoxi, Bai Nana, and Auntie Chen, who came to apply for the job the day before, came to work.

Currently, there were three more people working in the restaurant. Ye Zhuo had offered them a higher salary compared to the other shops, so the three of them worked very seriously. Ye Zhuo and Ye Shu also felt much more relaxed.

As the promotion was done well, the restaurant got busier and busier. Gradually, just the few of them was not enough to handle all the work in the restaurant, so Ye Zhuo hired two more people.

Days passed. Before Ye Zhuo started school again, Ye Shu wanted to take Ye Zhuo to Zhou Yuelian’s house for a visit. She also wanted to tell Zhou Yuelian about the opening of her new restaurant.

Over the years, Zhou Yuelian had been a great help to her in all aspects of her life. Ye Shu wanted to take this opportunity to properly thank Zhou Yuelian.

After Ye Shu told Ye Zhuo about this idea, Ye Zhuo nodded in agreement. “It just so happens that Sister Shasha is not working tomorrow. Why don’t we go there tomorrow?”

The next day, the mother and daughter bought a lot of gifts and set off to Zhou Yuelian’s house.

Zhou Yuelian’s house was situated in an old neighborhood. The environment couldn’t be compared to the new neighborhood, but it wasn’t too bad either. It was considered as a neighborhood for middle income families to stay in Yunjing.

Zhou Yuelian welcomed Ye Shu and Ye Zhuo’s arrival.

“Shasha! Your Aunt Shu and Zhuo Zhuo are here!” Zhou Yuelian continued, “Ah Shu, Zhuo Zhuo, come in and have a seat.”

Seeing the gift bags that the mother and daughter had brought with them, Zhou Yuelian scolded, “Ah Shu! It’s enough that you brought your daughter here to visit me! Why did you have to buy so many things for us? These things don’t cost money? Did your money come from a flood?” Zhuo Yuelian was very well aware that Ye Shu had been struggling to survive financially all these years. She really did not wish for Ye Shu to spend this money unjustly.

Ye Shu said, “I didn’t spend much money! Besides, Little Lian, haven’t you bought a lot of things for me all these years?”

Zhou Yulian said, “It’s not a competition!”

Ye Shu smiled and said, “That’s right! It’s not a competition! I only bought these few things. If you don’t accept them, you’re treating me as an outsider!”

Zhou Yuelian patted Ye Shu. “Look! You’re bringing me in circles.”

At that moment, Lin Shasha rushed out of the room. “Zhuo Zhuo!”

“Sister Shasha!” Ye Zhuo reached out and hugged Lin Shasha.

Zhou Yuelian’s husband, Lin Jinshui, also came out of his room.

Ye Shu introduced him to Ye Zhuo. “Zhuo Zhuo, come greet Uncle Lin.”

“Hello, Uncle Lin.”

Lin Jinshui was a very simple and honest middle-aged man.

He was a little chubby.

He smiled and replied, “Big niece looks like Ah Shu.”

After he said that, Lin Jinshui continued, “Then, Little Lian, you stay at home and entertain them. I’ll go buy some ingredients for the meal!”

“Alright!” Zhou Yuelian continued, “Ah Shu likes to eat pickled fish. Remember to buy a fat fish!”

“Got it,” Lin Jinshui replied.

Ye Shu said a little embarrassedly, “We’ll just make do with whatever you have at home. Brother-in-law, there’s no need to go shopping. It’s too troublesome!”

Zhou Yuelian put her arm around Ye Shu’s shoulder. “What’s so troublesome about that? We want to eat it too. Let him go. Let’s head inside for a chitchat.”

The living room of the Lin family was very tidy. The windows were bright and clean.

Lin Shasha immediately poured some water for the two guests, while Zhou Yuelian went to cut some fruit.

As Lin Shasha was passing the glass of water to Ye Zhuo, she saw her phone on the coffee table. She said, “Zhuo Zhuo, are you playing a game? Let’s play a game together!” She was actually in the middle of a game right before Ye Shu and Ye Zhuo arrived at her home. When she heard her mother saying that Ye Zhuo had come to their house, she was so excited that she ran out without even finishing her game.

Ye Zhuo asked, “What game are you playing?”

“Honor of Kings!” Lin Shasha answered.

Ye Zhuo raised her eyebrows slightly, “I think the game that my uncle likes to play is Honour of Kings. Is it really that fun?”

“It’s fun!” Lin Shasha said excitedly, “I’m a Silver! Do you want to play? I’ll carry[1] you!”

[1] “Carrying” is a term used in team games where one person wins the match for everyone else. Basically, the rest of the team was either useless or just played a supporting role to the one person who “carried” the team.
