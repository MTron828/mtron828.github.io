Doctor Liu got out of the car and nodded. “How is boss song doing recently?”

“Butler song said, “Boss has been living a very regular life recently. He no longer eats junk food. Don’t worry, he is very cooperative with your plan now.” ”

“”That’s good.”Doctor Liu picked up the medical kit and continued, “Let me check his various indicators.” ”

“”Okay, the boss is in the back garden. Please follow me.” ”

Doctor Liu nodded and followed Butler song.

“The two of them went all the way to the back garden of the song family. Only then did they see song Shiyu standing by the pond, leaning on the pillar of the pavilion, feeding a group of brightly colored koi fish. He looked a little lazy. ”

“He was wearing a white shirt. The first button was unbuttoned, revealing his exquisite collarbone and sexy Adam’s apple. ”

The sunlight seeped through the leaves and sprinkled on the white shirt.

“For some reason, he looked like he had lived a peaceful life. ”

“No matter which angle one looked at him from, one would not be able to tell that there was a killing intent hidden in this person. ”

“Third Master.”The Butler walked over.

Song Shiyu threw all the last fish food in his hands into the pond and looked back slightly. “What’s Wrong?”

“The butler said respectfully, “Doctor Liu is here to examine your body.” ”

Song Shiyu turned around and walked into the pavilion.

“Doctor Liu immediately followed him and placed his hand on song Shiyu’s pulse. After a moment, he said slowly, “Boss song is recovering very well. You just need to rest in peace for the rest of the time.” ”

“Okay.”Song Shiyu nodded slightly.

“After thinking for a moment, doctor Liu continued, “Boss song, there’s something I don’t know if I should say or not.” ”

“Song Shiyu looked up. “Whether you should say it or not, you’ve already said it.” ”

Doctor Liu choked. “I just went to Miss Chen’s place.”

Song Shiyu did not say anything.

“Doctor Liu did not know what song Shiyu meant, so he continued, “Miss Chen’s condition is very bad now. She hasn’t eaten for four days. If this continues, she might...” ”

“Before he could finish his sentence, song Shiyu interrupted him coldly, “Am I a Doctor?” ” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“”No,”doctor Liu said. ”

“Saving lives should be the responsibility of the Doctor.”

“But Miss Chen...”

“Butler song said at this moment, “Doctor Liu, you have crossed the line.” ”

“Song Shiyu’s face had already turned cold. If doctor Liu continued, he would not be happy. ”

Doctor Liu also reacted at this moment and immediately shut his mouth.

“Butler song continued, “Doctor Liu, do you have anything else?” ”

“”Not for the time being,”doctor Liu replied. ”

“”Then please follow me,”Butler Song continued. ”

Doctor Liu followed Butler Song’s footsteps.

“”Doctor Liu, this way please.” ”

“Okay.”Doctor Liu nodded.

“When they reached the door, Butler song lowered his voice and said, “Doctor Liu, if you don’t want to set yourself on fire, you shouldn’t mention anyone from the Chen family in front of Third Master.” ”

“Why?”Doctor Liu felt that it was a little strange.

“After all, before this, song Shiyu had always taken care of the Chen family. ”

“Butler song continued, “This matter is none of our business. You shouldn’t interfere either.” ”

“But Miss Chen is going to die soon!”Doctor Liu frowned.

“”That’s her business!”Housekeeper song continued, “It’s not like our third master put a knife to her neck and forced her to go on a hunger strike.” ”

Doctor Liu widened his eyes. “You also know about her hunger strike?”

“He thought that no one in the song family knew about it, so they all knew about it. They could only watch as Chen Siyao walked step by step into Hell. ”

“Housekeeper song nodded. “In short, just don’t mention this in front of third master.” ”
