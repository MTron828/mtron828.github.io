“Does everyone have to gather in the central square?”Someone in the crowd asked.

“Yes.”William nodded. “All of us have to go.”

Exotic beasts fed on humans. Only when they could not find any humans in the city would they collectively go out to look for humans.

“After the exotic beasts gathered, they would have the opportunity to launch the virus. ”

They would be annihilated in one fell swoop!

“Right at this moment, a young man in a suit walked out from the crowd. Because he had been running for his life for the past few days, the suit on his body was already covered in dust. He looked extremely pathetic. “You’re using us as bait!” ”

“To put it nicely, it was a gathering, but it was actually a bait. ”

“After all, the exotic beasts fed on humans. ”

“When these words were said, everyone began to discuss. ”

The word ‘bait’was too terrifying.

The slightest bit of carelessness would cause the exotic beasts to swallow them whole.

This was especially so for those who had witnessed the exotic beasts swallowing humans with their own eyes.

That scene was something they would never be able to forget for the rest of their lives.

“Are you using us as bait?”

“What right do you have to push us out!”

“Why don’t you use yourself as bait!”

“I see that you and that Mario are on the same side. You guys have a good tradition with the exotic beasts. Let’s all gather at the central plaza so that the exotic beasts can eat us directly!”

“”Right, that must be the case! After all, the exotic beasts were groomed by that Mario Exotic Beast!” ”

“That’s too scary!”

“The citizens had finally calmed down, but at this moment, they were once again enraged. ”

“The young man continued, “Everyone, don’t believe these two people! They are not good people!” ”

“Everyone agreed, “Right! Everyone, don’t believe him!” ”

“Looking at the scene in front of him, William was stunned for a moment. ”

There was not much time left.

“It would take about 30 minutes to get to the central square from here, but they had to avoid the exotic beasts along the way. It would take at least more than an hour to avoid being discovered by the exotic beasts. ”

“”I admit that doing so would indeed take a great risk, but now, is there a better way than this?”William continued, “At the very least, we have Miss Ye’s help now! “The time we agreed with Miss Ye is one hour and 30 minutes later. If we exceed this time, we might never be able to walk out of this place!” ”

“After a pause, William continued, “If everyone wishes to leave this prison, if everyone believes Miss Ye’s words, then follow me.” ”

“With that, William turned around and left. ”

Mario limped with one leg as he followed William’s footsteps.

The young man looked at the backs of the two of them with a complicated expression in his eyes.

Perhaps he shouldn’t be so cowardly.

Fortune comes from danger.

“Although they were going to be bait, they really had no other choice but to be bait. ”

They could not just sit here and wait for their deaths!

“William!”The young man shouted.

“Hearing that, William turned around. ”

“The young man continued, “William, I’ve decided to trust you this time!” ”

“After saying that, he followed William’s footsteps in large strides. ”

William looked at him. “We should all trust Miss Ye.”

“It was a very simple sentence. It did not contain any special emotions, but it somehow made people feel a lot more confident. ”

It was all because this sentence contained the words ‘Miss Ye’.

“The young man nodded. “Yes, we should all trust Miss Ye!” ”

Miss Ye was an eternal God! Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The originally hesitant crowd also followed their footsteps at this time.

L continent wasn’t big.

But it wasn’t small either.

“After this happened, everyone hid in a unified emergency shelter. ”

“Some shelters were discovered, while others were temporarily safe. ”

“At this time, everyone received the news and rushed to the central plaza. ”

Those who really couldn’t rush to the central plaza in a short time hid in the emergency shelter.

“An hour and twenty minutes later, everyone gathered in the central square. ”

“According to William, everyone fought in a circle. The old man and the child stood inside while the young man stood outside. ”

“It was something that had been discussed in advance, but at this time, a small situation happened in the crowd. ”

The old men who were standing inside seemed to have discussed it. They all walked out and stood outside the young man.

The young men were naturally unwilling to let the old men protect them.

“After all, respecting the old and loving the young were traditional virtues that could not be forgotten at any time. ”

“At this moment, an old man with grizzled hair walked onto the stage, held the microphone and said, “Everyone, listen to me. It’s already very hard for you young men to earn money to support your families. Let us protect you all for once.” ”
