“”No Way!”Bai Jiayu said in surprise, “Is it really for her?” ”

“Although he and song Shiyu had been good friends for many years, Bai Jiayu still couldn’t figure out song Shiyu’s personality. ”

He only knew a little about that little girl.

Song Shiyu turned a page of the document in his hand. “You’re overthinking it.”

“Bai Jiayu narrowed his eyes and continued, “Oh right, that sister of yours is trending. It’s quite troublesome. It’s not easy for a little girl like her to survive in the entertainment industry for so many years...” ”

“What trending?”Song Shiyu raised his head to look at Bai Jiayu.

“You still don’t Know?”Bai Jiayu asked in surprise.

“I don’t know.”Song Shiyu shook his head.

“He had never paid much attention to the entertainment news, so even if he had Weibo on his phone, it was just for show. ”

“Bai Jiayu continued, “You’ll know when you look at the trending topics on Weibo. Right now, the entire trending section is about your sister.” ”

“Song Shiyu did not immediately turn on his phone. Instead, he said, “Do you have anything else?” ”

“Bai Jiayu said, “There’s one last thing.” ”

“”Speak,”song Shiyu said concisely. ”

“Bai Jiayu continued, “Besides the venue tonight, there’s another venue tomorrow night. Brother song, are you sure you want to keep your body as still as Jade?” ”

Song Shiyu raised his hand and pointed at the door. “The door is over there.”

“”I’m not joking with you,”Bai Jiayu continued, “Seriously, there’s a robot boxing match at the science and Technology Hall in a few days. Do you want to go?” ”

Song Shiyu was very interested in robots. A subsidiary of the song group produced robots.

“The exact time.”

“Bai Jiayu said, “On the night of October 30th.” ”

“Song Shiyu hesitated for a moment. “We’ll see when the time comes.”He had quite a busy schedule these few days, so he might not have the time. ”

“Bai Jiayu nodded and said, “Then I’ll take my leave first.” ”

“Okay.”

Bai Jiayu turned around and left. Only then did song Shiyu pick up his phone and Open Weibo. He lowered his head to look at the trending topics on Weibo and narrowed his eyes.

“A moment later, he tapped his desk with his fingers, picked up the microphone, and dialed the internal line. “Let Secretary Yang come in for a moment.” ”

“His voice was very cold. Even through the microphone, it made people’s hearts tremble. ”

“Soon, Secretary Yang came in. “Boss, you’re looking for me.” ”

Song Shiyu frowned slightly. “Why didn’t anyone tell me about the trending topic on Weibo?”

“Secretary Yang asked somewhat uncertainly, “Are you referring to miss song?” ”

Song Shiyu nodded slightly.

Secretary Yang was stunned.

“Although song Chenyu was song Shiyu’s younger sister, song Shiyu usually did not care about her. ”

He did not expect song Shiyu to suddenly ask about the trending topic on Weibo.

“Secretary yang hurriedly said, “Boss, I’ll get the public relations department to handle this matter.” ”

“Although there was a lot of commotion on Weibo, song Shiyu was, after all, Song Shiyu. ”

“As long as he appeared, there would be a way to calm things down. ”

Song Shiyu gently raised his hand. “How did song Chenyu get injured?” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Song Shiyu saw that incident in the comments on Weibo.

“More accurately speaking, his gaze was attracted by ‘leaf’. ”

“If he remembered correctly, in village 2, everyone called Ye Zhuo ‘Yezi’. ”

“Song Shiyu did not use Weibo and did not pay much attention to song Chenyu’s matter. Naturally, he did not know that song Chenyu was injured on the program team, nor did he know that she had collaborated with song Yiwan to frame ye Zhuo. ”

“When he saw the comments on Weibo, song Shiyu frowned. ”

Injured?

Song Chenyu was injured?

It had been a few months since song Chenyu was injured.

Could it be that song Shiyu wanted to settle the old scores with him?

Secretary Yang looked up at song Shiyu and felt that this person’s face was frighteningly dark.

It looked like he was really angry.

It looked like ye Zhuo was going to be unlucky.

“Secretary Yang gulped. “It’s like this. When Miss song was filming village 2, she was injured on the production team...”regarding that matter, secretary Yang was the only one who knew the whole story. ”

“From a bystander’s point of view, this incident had nothing to do with Ye Zao. Ye Zao was almost implicated. ”

But song Shiyu was song Chenyu’s brother!

The person who was being bullied was song Chenyu.

Song Shiyu would definitely not let ye Zao off so easily.

“After listening to the whole story, song Shiyu continued, “Send me all the videos and responses.” ”

“Okay.”Secretary Yang nodded.

“Ten minutes.”Song Shiyu continued.
