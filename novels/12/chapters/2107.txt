“Didn’t you buy dessert?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“Aunty said she would give up dessert for you.”Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips opened slightly. “You can’t eat anymore today.”

“”Anyway, my mother isn’t here right now.”Ye Zhuo said. ”

“Eating too much candy is indeed bad for your body. You have to learn to control yourself.”Cen Shaoqing reached out and rubbed ye Zhuo’s head. “Why are you acting like a child?”

“”You’re the one acting like a child.”Ye Zhuo continued, “Cen Shaoqing, do you feel that you’re becoming more and more like a person?” ”

“Like who?”Cen Shaoqing raised his head and asked.

Ye Zhuo smiled slightly. “My Dad.”

Lin Jincheng often said the same thing.

Why are you acting like a child.

“Nonsense.”Cen Shaoqing pinched her face.

“”I’m serious,”ye Zhuo continued, “Just from the manner and tone of your voice, you look exactly like my father.” ”

Cen Shaoqing was thirty-three this year.

He was not much older than Lin Jincheng.

“However, Cen Shaoqing took good care of himself. Perhaps it was because he was a vegetarian, but he looked like he was at most twenty-five or twenty-six. ”

“At this moment, the stall owner brought the food over. ”

Ye Zao’s gaze was instantly attracted by the delicious food and he began to eat heartily.

Cen Shaoqing also heaved a sigh of relief and lowered his head to eat.

“The smelly tofu that had just been fried was paired with a secret spicy ingredient. With one bite, it was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. There was a hint of fragrance amidst the stench. The unique taste of the smelly tofu exploded in his mouth and it was almost irresistible. ”

Ye Zao ate a few pieces in one go. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Cen Shaoqing did not like things with too strong a taste. He ordered a plain cloud tun. At this moment, Ye Zhuo handed over a piece of stinky tofu and said, “Have a taste?” ”

“The black stinky tofu had a layer of sauce wrapped around its surface. With coriander and green onions, it looked very tempting. ”

Cen Shaoqing hesitated for a moment.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “The stinky tofu and the snail powder are two things that can only be eaten 0 times or countless times. Believe me, as long as you eat this one bite, you will fall in love with it.” ”

“Hearing this, Cen Shaoqing opened his mouth to take it and gently bit it open. ”

How should I put it...

This was a taste that could not be described with words.

“At first, it might be a little unacceptable, but as he slowly chewed on it, he found that the taste was indeed very good, making him forget to return. ”

No wonder his leader liked to eat it so much.

“Do you want another one?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

Ye Zhuo handed another piece to Cen Shaoqing’s mouth.

The scene on this side was all seen by a group of couples at the next table.

“The man said, “Look at other people’s girlfriends. They even feed their boyfriends. What About You?” ”

“The woman rolled her eyes at him and continued, “From their looks, I can tell that the man is richer than the woman, so the woman is trying to please him! What about you? What do you have?” ”

“If the man was not better than the woman, the woman would never feed the man herself. ”

“Hearing this, the man immediately shut up. ”

Who asked him to be poor!

“When he was rich, he would hug both sides and immediately get rid of this ugly woman. ”

Cen Shaoqing ate three pieces of stinky tofu in a row.

“Soon, the stall owner came over with a plate of fried skewers. ”

“Inside were fried golden crabs, mantis shrimps, chicken wings, beef and mutton skewers. ”

“Cen Shaoqing put on his disposable gloves and took advantage of the time when ye Zhuo was eating stinky tofu to peel off the shells of the crabs and mantis shrimps. Because ye Zhuo liked to eat these things, he specially developed a set of rapid peeling methods, in less than a few minutes, he peeled a plate of beautiful crab meat and shrimp meat. ”

“After peeling the shells, Cen Shaoqing picked up the chicken wing and split the two bones inside. ”

“In the blink of an eye, a plate of roasted chicken wings turned into boneless chicken wings. ”

Ye Zao ate them one by one happily.

“When the woman at the next table saw this scene, she looked at the man opposite her who was poor, poor, and did not know how to feel sorry for his girlfriend. She felt extremely depressed. ”

“She originally thought that the gap between them was too big, so the woman had been trying to curry favor with the man. Who would have thought that the man was even more attentive than the woman. ”

She had never seen a man who could pick out the bones of the chicken wings in his girlfriend’s bowl when they ate together.

It was simply infuriating to compare people.

What kind of Immortal Love was this?

“After eating all the food, Ceng Shaoqing handed the coke to Ye Zao. ”

“Barbecue and Coke, it was a perfect match. ”

“After eating, the two walked around the university town for a while before driving back. ”

Back home.
