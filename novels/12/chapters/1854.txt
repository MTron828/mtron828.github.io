“All these years, old Mrs. Cen had never lost to Old Mrs. Zuo. The only one who lost to Old Mrs. Zuo was her great-grandson. She was a little unhappy, but this did not stop her from liking the children on the ground, she squatted down and asked, “Baby, What’s Your Name?” ” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“The little guy said obediently, “My name is Zuo Zihan. I’m three years old this year!” ”

“Looking at the cute and cute little friend, Old Mrs. Cen couldn’t wait to take him home immediately. ”

What a pity!

This wasn’t her great-grandson.

“”Good, that’s great!”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Do you know what your great-grandmother’s name is?” ”

The little guy nodded. “Her name is Li Cuihua!”

Li Cuihua!

This little guy really dared to say that.

“One had to know that in the past, Old Mrs. Zuo cared the most about people calling her by her name. ”

“The people who were with her, this one was called poetic sentiment, that one was called Hua Yi, and she was called Cui Hua! ”

“PFFT!”Old Lady Cen laughed out loud.

The smile on Old Lady Zuo’s face could not be maintained. How could she have thought that old lady cen would ask such a strange question.

Western education was somewhat different from Chinese education.

“In China, it was extremely disrespectful for a junior to address an elder by his or her name. ”

“However, in the west, this was a very common thing. Hence, the little guy held the entire family’s name. ”

“If the little guy did not suddenly mention it, Old Lady Zuo would have forgotten that she had such a country bumpkin name! ”

“Seeing Old Lady Zuo’s face turn green and white, Old Lady Cen felt a little better. She smiled and said, “Good boy, well said. Great-grandmother will reward you with a Lollipop.” ”

“After saying that, the servant came over with the Lollipop. ”

“The Little Guy took the lollipop from the servant and said politely, “Thank you, great-grandmother.” ”

“”You’re welcome,”Old Lady Cen said with a smile. ”

“The little guy skillfully peeled off the lollipop and walked to Ye Zao. He smiled and said, “Sister, you’re so beautiful. I like you.” ”

Children liked ye Zao without any disguise. He really liked ye Zao.

“It was not only because ye Zao was beautiful, but also because of the amiable temperament on her body, which made people unconsciously want to get close to her. ”

“Ye Zao slightly bent down, picked up the little guy and sat on his lap. He corrected him, “Do you know you have to call me Auntie?” ”

“”But you are clearly sister,”the little guy said. ”

“His mother had already taught him to call her auntie when he was older. The young and beautiful ones had to call her sister, and the gray-haired ones had to call her grandma. ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Sure, as long as you are happy.” ”

Being called sister was also a joyful thing.

“Very soon, CEN Shaoqing came out. ”

“Old Lady Zuo looked at Cen Shaoqing and ye Zao, and the more she looked at them, the more she felt that the two of them were a perfect match. ”

“At the same time, she also felt a little emotional. ”

“She did not expect Cen Shaoqing to also find a girlfriend and start a family. Moreover, he did not want to make a name for himself, but he was able to make a name for himself. ”

He had found such a beautiful girlfriend!

“”Shaoqing, when are you going to hold the wedding with Zhonghua?”Old Mrs. Zuo asked. ”

“CEN Shaoqing said, “There’s no rush.” ”

“”There’s no rush!”Old Mrs. Zuo said, “You’re already in your thirties, right? Our Xiao Feng is three years younger than you. Zihan is already three years old!” ”

Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted slightly. “Zhonghua hasn’t graduated yet. We’ll talk about it after she graduates.”

“”Oh, is that so!”Old Mrs. Zuo nodded. ”

She had thought that Cen Shaoqing did not want to be responsible for ye Zhonghua!

It turned out that ye Zhonghua had not graduated yet!

It seemed that Cen Shaoqing was more involved with ye Zhonghua than she had imagined.

This child had suffered a huge setback this time!

Old Mrs. Cen was still secretly counting with her fingers when ye Zhonghua would graduate.

Ye Zao was now in his third year of college.

There was still a year left.

Old Mrs. Cen was extremely excited at the thought that she would soon be able to hold her great-grandchild.

She had to take good care of her body and smoothly see the birth of her great-grandchild.

“Ye Zao and Cen Shaoqing’s genes were both so good. Her great-grandchild must be both smart and cute, just like the Carp doll in the New Year Picture. ”

“The more old Mrs. Cen thought about it, the happier she became. Her eyes almost narrowed into slits. ”

“Soon, it was time to eat. ”

The chef cooked a big table of dishes.

“When they were eating, Sun Fanghua was even more surprised. ”

Because Cen Shaoqing had been serving ye Zhuo the entire time.

“Peeling prawns for her, splitting crab roe... ”

“At the same time, Sun Fanghua was also somewhat envious of Ye Zhuo. ”

“As a woman, Ye Zhuo was really too blessed! ”

She had never eaten a single prawn that Zuo Lu peeled for her.

“After eating, at around four o’clock in the afternoon, old Mrs. Zuo and Mrs. Zuo proposed to leave. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen held old Mrs. Zuo’s hand, somewhat reluctant to let her leave. ”
