“Yes.”Bai Mo nodded. “I’m sure.”

“After learning that Bai Jingshu had gone back, man Wen heaved a sigh of relief. After all, she was on Earth, so it was normal for him to not be able to contact her. He then said, “Thank you, I understand.” ”

“”Brother Man Wen, you don’t have to be so polite with me,”Bai Mo said with a smile. ”

“Man Wen said, “I still have some matters to attend to, so I’ll take my leave first. You can just charge me for the coffee.” ”

“”Brother Man Wen, you go ahead and don’t worry about me,”Bai Mo said understandingly. ”

“Looking at man Wen’s back, Bai Mo narrowed her eyes. ”

“Man Wen was much more difficult to navigate than she had imagined, but fortunately, she still had Bai Jingshu as a friend. ”

“Since Bai Jingshu could become friends with Man Wen, she could definitely do the same! ”

Didn’t this couple start out as friends?

Bai Jingshu had been hungry for almost three days.

She had been sitting on the bed for the past three days and couldn’t muster up any strength.

“She was very hungry, and her hunger for food had reached its peak. ”

She even felt that she could eat up a mountain if she was given one.

“However, the smell of roasted chicken drumsticks drifted over from the door. ”

“Then, the servant’s voice rang out. “Eldest miss, this chicken drumstick is just right. It’s sizzling with oil, and its mouth is full of oil. Add some chili powder and cumin powder, and the taste is simply superb. Don’t you think you should have a bite?” ”

“Bai Jingzhu looked in the direction of the door, her eyes full of desire. ”

But she couldn’t compromise. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Absolutely Not!

“”Miss, if you don’t like drumsticks, Mr. and Mrs. have also ordered other delicious dishes. There are steaming noodles and meat dumplings...” ”

Bai Jingzhu couldn’t help but swallow her throat.

“At this moment, Bai Jingfei walked over. “She still won’t eat it?” ”

“Yes.”The maid nodded.

“Bai Jingfei was a little speechless. “Bai Jingzhu, what’s wrong with you? I advise you to Stop Now! Be careful not to make things worse. You’ll really lose your life!” ”

“I’m not afraid.”Bai Jingzhu’s weak voice came from inside.

It seemed like she was starving!

“Bai jingfei continued, “I say, are you sick? Isn’t the Chen family pretty good? If I Were you, I would marry them directly. But you, you don’t know how Lucky You are and want to Die!” ”

Bai Jingzhu didn’t say anything else.

“”Bai Jingzhu, I have looked down on you since you were young. I still look down on you!”Bai jingfei continued, “What kind of sister do you think you are? ! Other People’s sisters would do their best to earn a good future for their younger sister. But you, you would rather starve to death than give your younger sister some face!” ”

Bai Jingfei was disappointed that her iron was not strong enough.

“If Bai Jingshu agreed to marry into the Chen family, although she would not be able to obtain star energy, the circle she would come into contact with in the future would change. ”

“But now, Bai Jingshu was actually like this. ”

“Bai jingfei continued, “Why am I so unlucky? I was born into such a family. My parents are biased, my older sister is selfish, and my younger brother, stop talking about it! “Bai Jingshu, can’t you think about our big family? “Why are you so selfish?” ”

There was still no response.

Bai Jingfei did not say anything more and turned around to go downstairs.

“In the blink of an eye, it was the fourth day. ”

Bai Jingshu still refused to give in.

“This time, even Bai Jiacheng and Zhou Ying were a little anxious. ”

“Bai Jiacheng said angrily, “An evil daughter! She’s simply an evil daughter!”The daughters of other families were here to repay their kindness, but Bai Jingshu was here to collect the debt. ”

“Zhou Ying continued, “Why don’t we stop forcing her? Today is already the fourth day. What if something happens due to hunger?” ”

“Then clone one!”Bai Jiasheng said.

“Nowadays, S star system’s technology was advanced, and cloning technology was already very advanced. However, due to certain reasons, cloning technology had been banned. ”

“Hearing this, Bai Jingfei, who was drinking water, frowned. ”

Clone One?

Zhou Ying narrowed her eyes. “You’ve found a way?”

Cloning a sensible and obedient daughter was indeed a good idea.

“However, once she was caught, the consequences would be unimaginable. ”

“”Of course, I’m prepared for anything,”said Bai Jiasheng. ”

“If it weren’t for the fact that they had no choice, as parents, who would be willing to do this! ”

This was all because of Bai Jingzhu!

Bai Jingfei put down her cup and walked upstairs.

“The maid was still waiting at the door. When she saw Bai Jingfei walk over, she immediately greeted her. ”

“Bai jingfei continued, “I’ll go in and persuade her.” ”

“The maid said awkwardly, “Second miss, Mr. and Mrs. said that no one is allowed to go in and see the eldest miss.” ”

“”Did my parents say that even I’m not allowed to go in and take a look? You’re just a maid in our house. As long as I’m unhappy, you don’t have to come tomorrow!” ”

“Hearing this, the servant hesitated for a moment before continuing, “Then you can go in and take a look, but don’t stay too long.” ”

“Got it.”Bai jingfei nodded.

The servant opened the door and let Bai Jingfei in.

“Hearing the sound of the door opening, Bai Jingshu, who was on the bed, raised her eyelids. She wanted to say something, but she didn’t have much strength. ”

“Bai jingfei continued, “You’re Not Dead Yet? Not bad, you’re quite tenacious!” ”

“W-what are you doing here?”Bai Jingshu asked weakly.

“”I’m here to see if you’re dead or Not!”Bai Jingfei walked to the bed and sat down. She reached out and pinched Bai Jingshu’s chin, forcing her to open her mouth. Then, she threw a black pill into Bai Jingshu’s mouth. ”

Bai Jingshu no longer had the strength to struggle. She could only let the pill melt in her mouth.

“”Listen, you mustn’t Die! Otherwise, your trip to the mortal world will be in vain!” ”

“After saying this, Bai Jingfei left the room. ”

“Bai Jingshu looked at Bai Jingfei’s back. For some reason, after eating a pill, she felt her hunger lessen significantly. ”

“The maid paced back and forth in front of the door. When she saw Bai Jingfei finally come out, she breathed a sigh of relief. “Second miss!” ”

Bai Jingfei looked at the maid. “Have my parents been here?”

“No.”The maid shook her head.

Bai jingfei nodded and turned around to head downstairs.

“Bai jingfei came all the way to the old house. She searched the hall but could not find old master Bai, so she found the butler of the old house. “Where’s My Grandfather?” ”

“”Old Master is taking an afternoon nap,”the butler replied. ”

“I’ll go in and take a look.”

“The Butler stopped Bai Jingfei. “Miss Jingfei, you can’t go in!” ”

“Old Master Bai’s favorite granddaughter was Bai Jingzhu. Bai Jingfei had always been a snob since she was young, so she didn’t really like Old Master Bai. ”

“If she rushed in recklessly, she would definitely be scolded. ”

“Bai jingfei said, “I have something urgent to find grandfather!” ”

“After saying that, she waved the butler’s hand away and went straight into the bedroom. ”

“Grandfather!”

Old Master Bai was woken up by Bai Jingfei’s voice. “What’s Wrong?”

“Bai jingfei continued, “Grandpa, please go and save my sister! She’s going to starve to death by my parents!” ”

“”What’s Going On!”Hearing this, elder Bai immediately woke up. ”
