Translator: 549690339

“Believe in Miss Ye!”

Someone in the crowd shouted out loud.

“”Mommy, I’m Scared.”The young child curled up in his mother’s arms and was so scared that his face turned white. ”

His mother hugged the child tightly. “Don’t be scared. Miss ye will come and save us.”

The child nodded. “Is Miss Ye more powerful than Superman?”

“”Yes, Miss Ye is more powerful than Superman!” ”

Superman was only a virtual character.

But Miss Ye was real.

“The child continued, “Then I won’t worship Superman in the future. I want to worship Miss Ye!” ”

The footsteps and roars of the exotic beasts were getting closer and closer.

The mother hugged the child tightly.

“William looked at the dense mass of exotic beasts, his face full of fear. ”

He had never seen so many exotic beasts gathered together.

It was too terrifying.

“Buddy...”William’s voice trembled as he looked at Mario. “What do we do now?”

There was no fear on Mario’s face as he looked straight ahead. “Wait for Miss Ye!”

Or wait for Miss Ye.

William felt that Mario was possessed.

What time was it? He was still waiting for Miss Ye.

It was very obvious that ye Zao wouldn’t come again.

“”She won’t come.”William continued, “We’ve all been deceived by her.” ”

“William was extremely regretful now, regretting why he had brought everyone to the central plaza. ”

“If they hadn’t come to the central plaza, they might still have been saved. ”

“But now, they could only become food for the exotic beasts. ”

“”Miss Ye won’t lie.”Mario continued, “I believe in her.” ”

William didn’t know what to say either.

It was too difficult for Mario.

“When he should have believed in ye Zao, he didn’t believe in ye Zao. When he shouldn’t have believed in ye Zao, he firmly believed in ye Zao. ”

“”What if she lied to You?”William continued, “There are only five seconds left.” ”

“Mario didn’t say anything. He raised his head to look at the sky, hoping that ye Zao would appear. ”

“On the other hand, William was looking at the constantly approaching exotic beasts, hoping for a miracle to appear. ”

He was no longer looking forward to ye Zao.

This was because he knew that ye Zao wouldn’t appear anymore.

“Instead of looking forward to the people who wouldn’t appear, it would be better to look forward to a miracle. ”

Everyone’s faces were filled with terror.

“After all, this was an exotic beast that ate people without batting an eyelid. ”

“The elders stood at the outermost layer, their faces filled with determination. Faced with the constantly approaching exotic beasts, they didn’t have the slightest intention of retreating. ”

“They were old, so it didn’t matter if they died. ”

But the young people behind them couldn’t be harmed!

“As long as there were young people around.., ”

“after the exotic beasts appeared, they didn’t immediately launch an attack. Instead, they quickly surrounded the central plaza. ”

“Looking at it this way, it was extremely terrifying. ”

“William’s face broke out in cold sweat, and he was also increasingly regretful. He shouldn’t have brought everyone to the central plaza. ”

I’m sorry...

“Mario said softly, “William, old friend, do you believe in Miss Ye?” ”

“”I used to,”William said. ” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

He no longer believed in her.

That was because they were already the prey of the exotic beasts.

“Mario continued, “Believe me, Miss Ye will definitely come.” ”

“Looking at Mario like this, William shook his head helplessly. ”

“At this point in time, Mario was still so stubborn. ”

Bang Bang Bang.

“At this moment, the exotic beasts that had surrounded everyone began to press on. ”

Everyone could only hold each other’s hands tightly as they retreated step by step.

“Seeing that the circle was getting smaller and smaller, and that the time that he had agreed with Ye Zhuo had reached the last second, the light in William’s eyes completely disappeared. ”

No one had noticed that the originally still white clouds in the sky had suddenly become infinitely large.

“They’re here!”

“Mario’s pupils dilated at this moment, his eyes filled with shock. ”

Perhaps no one had expected that the Chinese aircraft would disguise themselves as the white clouds in the sky.

He had known that ye Zao would definitely come!

He had not trusted the wrong person.

“At this moment, countless smoke bombs were thrown down from the aircraft. ”

William raised his head to take a look.

He saw that the originally calm and tranquil sky had suddenly been filled with countless aircraft.

They had really come!

“At this moment, William’s face was filled with disbelief. ”

He hadn’t expected ye Zao to appear on time.

As expected of ye Zao!

He was indeed worthy of People’s Trust.

“Seeing the smoke bombs suddenly thrown down from the aircraft, everyone was extremely alarmed. ”

“Mario immediately picked up the loudspeaker and continued, “Everyone, don’t worry. Miss ye said that these smoke bombs will not cause any harm to humans!” ”

“With these words, everyone felt much more at ease. ”

“After the smoke bombs came into contact with the ground, there wasn’t any particularly obvious smell. ”
