“At most, she could live a normal life from now on. ”

Ye Lan got up from the ground and walked towards the aircraft.

“Although she was no longer the chief of the ye base, her connections were still there. ”

Ye Lan adjusted her emotions and went to the population bureau to input the DNA into the database.

“The staff looked at Ye Lan. “Ms. Ye Lan, please wait for a while. We will inform you when the report is out.” ”

“How much longer do you need to wait?”Ye Lan asked.

“”About two hours,”the staff member replied. ”

Ye Lan was stunned. “So Soon?”

She had also come to the Census Bureau to check before.

“But at that time, the staff member’s reply to her was always unsearchable ”

It was all ye Zao’s fault.

It was all ye Zao’s fault.

“If ye Zao had not stopped her from looking for her parents, she would not have been deceived by Qiu Di. ”

“Ye Zao could not find her biological parents, but he still had to stop her from looking for her parents! ”

How could there be such a disgusting person in the world?

“”Because your information was previously encrypted, it is in an unsearchable state.”The staff member continued, “Today is a rest day. If it was a working day, it would be even faster.” ”

Ye Lan nodded.

The process of waiting was very torturous.

“But when she thought about how she would be able to meet her parents soon, even if her family was not that prominent, ye Lan felt very satisfied. ”

“In fact, there was nothing bad about the life of an ordinary person. ”

She liked the life of an ordinary person.

“Time passed by minute by minute, and soon, two hours had passed. ”

The staff member walked over with the information.

“”Hello, Ms. Ye Lan.” ”

“Hello.”Ye Lan immediately stood up from her chair.

“The staff member passed the information to ye Lan and said, “This is all the information about your family. Please take a look. I hope you can untie the knot in your heart and reunite with your family as soon as possible.” ”

“Thank you.”Ye Lan took the information.

“She did not open it immediately. Instead, she brought the information back to her residence. After burning incense and cleaning her hands, she opened it. ”

The first page was her father’s information.

Zuo Shunguo.

Male.

50 years old.

“Seeing this, Ye Lan frowned slightly. ”

Zuo Shunguo?

Why did she feel that this name was a little familiar.

It seemed that the scumbag that Grandma Fei had mentioned was called Zuo Shunguo.

Could it be...

Things were really as Grandma Fei had said.

“Her father was a scumbag who sold his daughter for Glory. Her mother was dead, and her sister had been sold? ”

No.

It wouldn’t be like that.

It definitely wouldn’t be like this.

Ye Lan comforted herself in her heart and tried her best to calm herself down. She continued to read.

“Changyue country, Donglin country, native place, full. ”

“Zuo Shunguo had a long-term alcoholism and a violent personality. He had two daughters with his wife. His eldest daughter, Zuo Shiqing, lived in a small red house and sold her arts. His youngest daughter, Zuo Huayi, was taken out by her mother at a young age. Her whereabouts were unknown. ”

“Ye Lan’s fingertips were trembling from the beating, but she still turned to the second page. ”

Murong Qi.

Female.

50 years old.

A native of Changyue and Donglin. She was born in Manchuria.

“In 10042, because she could not stand her husband’s domestic violence, she ran away from home with her youngest daughter. After that, she died in an accident. ”

Zuo Shiqing.

Female.

22 years old.

A native of Changyue and Donglin. She was born in Manchuria.

“In 10058, she was sold into the little red mansion by her father. ” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Seeing this, Ye Lan couldn’t help but burst into tears. ”

Why.

Why did fate play such a joke on her.

“How could she have such a father, such a mother, and such a sister! ”

She just wanted to have a family.

“Even if there was only one in the family, she would accept it. ”

“But now, reality had played such a joke on her. ”

“Even in her dreams, ye Lan did not expect that everything that Grandma Fei told her was true. ”

Everything was true!

“”Sister, sister, I’m Sorry!”Ye Lan shouted, “I’m Sorry!” ”

“If she had known earlier, she would not have betrayed ye Zhuo no matter what. ”

This was all her fault!

“If it were not for her betrayal, ye Zao would not have died. ”

“Ye Zao had treated her so well and given so much for her, but she had repaid kindness with enmity. ”

Regret.

“Ye Lan was really regretful, so regretful that even her intestines turned green. ”

“Thinking of her previous foolish self, Ye Lan could not stop crying. ”

Now...

Did she still have a chance to redeem herself?

“Right at this moment, ye Lan seemed to have thought of something. She immediately stood up from the chair, wiped the tears off her face, and walked out of the door. ”

She was going to look for Grandma Fei.

“Grandma Fei treated her better than her own granddaughter. If she made a mistake and repeatedly came to persuade her, Grandma Fei would definitely forgive her. ”

“Ye Zhuo and Grandma Fei were like blood-related grandchildren. As long as Grandma Fei forgave her, Ye Zhuo would definitely forgive her too. ”

“Thinking of this, Ye Lan felt much better. ”

The flying machine was very fast.
