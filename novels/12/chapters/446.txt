“”This safe is the latest model from Thailand. The security system is especially strict. If I’m not wrong, there’s an English website on the far left. Send me that website.””

“”Okay.”After hanging up, Lin Ze found the website on the left side of the safe and sent it to the other party.”

“After doing all this, a voice came from downstairs.”

It was madam Lin and the others.

Lin Ze frowned slightly and quickly restored the room to its original state. He carefully came out of the room and walked downstairs.

“Meow.”

A fat cat rushed down from the cat rack and jumped into Lin Ze’s arms.

Lin Ze carried the cat downstairs.

“Seeing Lin Ze, Madam Lin said in surprise, “Ah Ze, why are you back?””

Lin Ze’s expression was the same as usual. “I came back to get some clothes.”

“Old Mrs. Lin said, “How can you come back on your own after getting some clothes? Just give Xiao Liu a call and ask him to send them over to you.””

“I’m not used to other people entering my room.”

“”Since you’re already back, you can stay at home for dinner. Your Aunt Feng will be cooking tonight.”On the other hand, old Mrs. Lin also wanted Lin Ze and Feng Qianhua to develop a relationship.”

“”I’ve already eaten. Grandma, you guys can eat. I’ll be leaving first.”Lin Ze rubbed his cat and walked out of the door.”

“Seeing Lin ze like this, Madam Lin’s eyes flashed with displeasure.”

“Lin Ze would always be like this. No matter how good Feng Qianhua was to him, he would always be impervious!”

It was as if he had no heart.

Feng Qianqian was many times more sensible than him.

“Old Mrs. Lin did not understand. She was the one who raised Lin Ze. Moreover, Feng Qianhua often brought Feng Qianqian to visit him when he was young. Why did he not have any feelings for Feng Qianhua at all.”

“If Feng Qianqian could treat Lin Jincheng as her biological father, why couldn’t Lin Ze treat Feng Qianhua as his biological mother?”

Was it because Lin ze crawled out from Ye Shu’s stomach?

Ye Shu’s blood flowed in his bones?

“But not only was ye Shu fickle-minded, she hadn’t even fulfilled her responsibility as a mother for a day. As long as Lin Ze knew his limits, he should also know that a mother like ye Shu shouldn’t be concerned about her.”

Because she wasn’t worthy.

Feng Qianhua was more qualified to be a mother than she was.

“She didn’t know when Lin Ze, this child, would become sensible.”

“The more she thought about it, the more uncomfortable she felt.”

“”Auntie Lin, is Ah Ze back?”Feng Qianhua walked in through the back door.”

“”Yes.”Old Mrs. Lin continued, “He said he came back to get his clothes.””

“”OH.”Feng Qianhua nodded. “Then I’ll go back to the kitchen. If Auntie Lin needs anything, just call me.””

“”Okay.”Old Mrs. Lin smiled and said, “Qianhua, thank you for your hard work!””

“”No, it’s my pleasure.””

“Looking at Feng Qianhua’s back, Old Mrs. Lin seemed to have thought of something. She quickly picked up her phone and made a call.”

Soon.

The call was connected.

“Secretary Zhang?”

“”Old Mrs. Lin, it’s me.””

“Old Mrs. Lin continued, “Is Jin Cheng by your side?””

“Secretary Zhang replied, “President Lin went to the sanatorium after settling official business.””

“Did you manage to do that?”

Secretary Zhang was holding a document on the other end of the phone. His face was full of hesitation. He had been by Lin Jin Cheng’s side for more than five years. He knew how difficult it had been for Lin Jin Cheng all these years.

To make him betray Lin Jin Cheng.

He really couldn’t do it.

“Secretary Zhang!” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Old Madam Lin’s voice sounded again.

“Secretary Zhang opened his mouth. “Old Madam, I...””

“Madam Lin suddenly shouted, “Secretary Zhang, don’t you want to save your children? If you don’t want to save them, I’ll immediately stop the hospital’s medication!””

“Secretary Zhang had a son and a daughter, aged 10 and 12 years old.”

“Earlier this year, he was suddenly diagnosed with uremia.”

“For uremia, a single round of hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis was not a small expense. If he were to receive a kidney transplant later on, it would be a huge sum of money!”

“Thinking of his young children, Secretary Zhang’s eyes suddenly turned red. “Old Lady, don’t Be Like This! I’ll do it right away!””

“I’ll wait for your news.”Only then was Old Lady Lin Satisfied.

“After hanging up the phone, secretary Zhang looked at the documents in his hands and then looked at the safe in the corner of the office.”

“In his dilemma, he still walked to the safe and opened it.”

There was only one diary in the huge safe.

“The owner of the diary was Lin Jincheng, which recorded all his memories of Ye Shu.”
