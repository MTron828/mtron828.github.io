Lin Ze held Bai Jingshu’s hand. “Mom is right. Don’t worry too much. Grandpa will definitely be fine.”

“Okay.”

Downstairs.

“Ye Shu was also a little anxious, she looked at Lin Jincheng and said, “Elder Bai’s health is so bad. His only wish now is to see the child. If the old man can’t see the child, it will be a lifelong regret. It would be great if the old man could see the child.””

Lin Jincheng sighed softly. “This matter is also difficult to handle.”

“Luoluo?”Ye Shu looked at ye Zao beside her. “You always have many ideas. Come up with a solution!” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“In Ye Shu’s eyes, Ye Zao was simply an omnipotent existence.”

“Ye Zao said, “Mom, it’s impossible to bring the baby back. I can only think of a way to let them see him.””

“Ye Shu nodded and said with a smile, “Yes, yes, yes, we can just meet him once.””

There must be a way.

It was just a little difficult.

“Ye Zhuo looked at Ye Shu. “Mom, tell sister-in-law not to be anxious.””

“Okay.”

Time passed very quickly.

“In the blink of an eye, a month had passed.”

The Lin family’s eldest grandson’s full moon wine naturally couldn’t be too casual. Lin Jincheng had invited many guests.

Ye Han and Shi Qingcheng also came.

“It had already been a month. The child, who was originally only a little more than eight pounds, now weighed 16 pounds. His two big eyes looked limpid and especially cute.”

Shi Qingcheng picked up the child. “Oh my God! This is too cute! It doesn’t look like a child who just got a full moon.”

“For some reason, Bai Jingshu and Lin Ze weren’t fat, but the baby they gave birth to grew fat like crazy. Other People’s children grew at most five or six pounds a month, but the little iron pillar grew eight pounds! It looked a little bigger than a two-month-old child.”

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “You and ye Xiaohan should get married earlier and give birth to one as well. It’s even cuter than our little iron pillar.””

“Shi Qingcheng said a little embarrassedly, “We’re not in a hurry.””

“”Ye Xiaohan,”Bai Jingshu turned to look at ye Han and continued, “You have to be more proactive!””

“Ye Han smiled and said, “I’m already being proactive enough. Qingcheng isn’t in a hurry, so there’s nothing I can do.””

No one was more proactive than him!

“Bai Jingshu continued, “Then you guys won’t be later than searing, right?””

“Shi Qingcheng nodded. “If nothing unexpected happens, it should be.””

“Hearing that, Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “Ye Xiaohan, looks like you have to create some accidents.””

“”Jingshu, what are you talking about!”Bai Jingshu pushed Bai Jingshu a little embarrassedly.”

“After all, the words ‘create accidents’didn’t seem normal no matter how one looked at it.”

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “Look at you. I only said ‘create accidents’. What did you think of?””

Shi Qingcheng picked up the child. “I’ll play with the baby and ignore you!”

Bai Jingshu smiled.

“Shi Qingcheng held the baby and chatted with Ye Han. “Ye Xiaohan, who do you think little tie Zhu looks like?””

“Ye Han looked at the child seriously and said, “I think he looks more like brother Ze.””

“Shi Qingcheng said, “Why do I feel like he’s burning? Look at his Phoenix eyes. They’re exactly the same.””

“Ye Han lowered his head and looked at her again. “If that’s the case, he does look a little like my sister.””

Bai Jingshu stood at the side and smiled at Lin Ze. “Look at how professional Qingcheng is with her baby. Do you still remember the first time you held a baby? It was like hanging a frog!”

“Lin Ze said, “Her sister has already given birth to three children. How can she not be professional?””

Bai Jingshu smiled. “Really?”

Lin Ze nodded. “I heard it from ye Xiaohan too.”

“”Her sister is so amazing!”Bai Jingshu was really impressed. She had felt the pain of giving birth to one child, yet Shi Qingcheng’s sister had given birth to three in one go!”

“”Sister-in-law.”At this moment, ye Zao’s voice sounded in the air.”

Bai Jingshu looked back slightly. “Zao Zao.”

“Ye Zao walked in from outside and gave Bai Jingshu a black communicator. “Sister-in-law, you can contact tie Zhu’s great-grandfather now.””

Bai Jingshu’s face was filled with disbelief. “Really?”

“”Yes.”Ye Zao nodded and continued, “But it’ll only take thirty minutes at most.””

“Bai Jingshu was very excited. “Enough, enough, thirty minutes is enough! Zao Zao, Thank You!””

“”Sister-in-law, we’re all family.””

Bai Jingshu hugged ye Zao.

“Lin Ze stood behind Bai Jingshu, looked at ye Zao, and silently gave her a thumbs up.”

Bai Jingshu could not sleep because of this. Ye Zao had finally fulfilled her wish.
