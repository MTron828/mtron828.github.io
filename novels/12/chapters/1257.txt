“Xiao Wang did not know how to explain, “Miracle Doctor Ye is just a seventeen or eighteen-year-old girl... but, maybe this is the legendary genius.” ”

A layer of cold sweat appeared on Doctor Li’s head.

Who did he just reject?

Miracle Doctor Ye!

“At this moment, Xiao Wang continued, “Oh right, doctor Li, the director wants you to go to his office immediately.” ”

“Got it.”

“Doctor Li picked up the glasses on the table, put them on, and hurried in the direction of the director’s office. ”

“Soon, they arrived at the director’s office. ”

The door was open.

“From the open door, they could see that the director was talking to a young girl. ”

“The deputy director and director Ma were standing at the side, cautious. ”

The young girl looked to be about seventeen or eighteen years old.

Her skin was porcelain white.

“Her facial features were exquisite like a painting, her eyebrows were alluring, and her skin was as smooth as cream. ”

“Although she was young, her aura was very strong. ”

It could not be ignored.

“It made director Zhang, who was sitting opposite her, look like a passerby. ”

How could a child from an ordinary family have such an aura?

Doctor Li tried his best to calm himself down. He took a deep breath and reached out to knock on the door. “Director Zhang.”

The conversation in the office was interrupted by Doctor Li. Director Zhang raised his head slightly and saw doctor Li outside the door. His expression did not look too good. “Come in.”

Doctor Li walked in.

“Director Zhang continued, “This is Miracle Doctor Ye. Hurry up and apologize to Miracle Doctor Ye!” ”

Ye Zhuo raised his hand slightly. “There’s no need to apologize. I just want to understand my uncle’s treatment plan with Doctor Li.”

“Although ye Zao had said that there was no need to apologize, doctor Li still bowed and apologized sincerely. ”

He should not judge a person’s ability based on their age.

He should not have rejected ye Zao even more.

“After apologizing, doctor Li picked up a document and handed it to Ye Zao. “This is the detailed medical condition and medication records. Please take a look.” ”

Ye Zao took the document and read ten lines along the way. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“She read it very quickly, which made people subconsciously doubt whether she had seen it clearly or not. ”

“A moment later, ye Zao put down the document. “My uncle’s condition should be a virus infection. So these measures of yours treat the symptoms but not the root cause.” ”

Ye Sen’s external injuries had basically been dealt with.

“But because the virus infection was in the body, it would appear in this state. ”

“”Virus infection?”Doctor Li continued, “Miracle Doctor Ye, did you see wrongly? I didn’t find any virus.” ”

“”Mr. Ye obviously lost too much blood. In addition, his lungs were seriously injured and he couldn’t breathe normally. This caused him to be unconscious and unable to recover.” ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “I went to the ward to take a look. This is a very rare virus. With the current equipment, it might not be able to detect it.” ”

“A virus that even the equipment could not detect, how could ye Zao be able to detect it with his eyes? ”

This was a little too exaggerated!

“Even though doctor Li admired Miracle Doctor Ye very much, he still felt a little incredulous. “Are you sure?” ”

It was true that ye Zao had cured cancer.

But Cancer was the oncology department after all.

This could only mean that ye Zao was an oncologist.

But Ye Sen had suffered external injuries!

“Ye Zao nodded. “Currently, I have already prepared the treatment plan. I need your cooperation.” ”

“Doctor Li frowned. “Miracle Doctor Ye, but I don’t think that your uncle has a virus infection.” ”

Director Zhang coughed lightly.

Doctor Li did not say anything else.

“Ye Zao turned to look at director Zhang. “Then, I’ll have to trouble director Zhang to assign a few people to help me.” ”

“”Sure, no problem.”Director Zhang nodded. ”

“After saying that, director Zhang continued, “When is godly doctor ye going to perform the surgery?” ”

“”Tomorrow,”ye Zhuo answered. ”

“”Okay, no problem.”Director Zhang continued, “Do you have any other arrangements?” ”

“”Nothing else,”ye Zhuo said. ”

“Director Zhang said, “If you do, you must directly bring it up.” ”

“Okay.”

“After arranging the surgery tomorrow, Ye Zhuo and ye Shu left the office together. ”

“After ye Zhuo left, director Zhang looked at Doctor Li and said angrily, “You dare to question Miracle Doctor Ye’s diagnosis! Are you worthy of her current position in the medical world?” ”

“Ye Zhuo had made great contributions to the medical world. At present, the leaders of the medical world were already making arrangements to make a bronze statue of Ye Zhuo! ”

“At that time, Ye Zao’s bronze statue would stand in front of hospitals all over the world! ”

“When he first received the news from the medical world, director Zhang was completely flustered. ”

“He thought that even he, the director, would be implicated. ”

“Fortunately, ye Zao did not pursue the responsibility. ”

“Doctor Liu continued, “Director, you don’t understand the situation. Ye Sen really isn’t infected by the virus! Everyone makes mistakes. We can’t assume that she won’t make mistakes just because she is Miracle Doctor Ye!” ”
