Find it back?

“These three words sounded easy, but how was he going to find it back?”

Zou Feifei’s lowered eyes were full of sarcasm.

“If the hacked surveillance cameras could be found again, then there would be no hackers!”

“Zou feifei pretended to be surprised and said, “How could this be? That restaurant was too unscrupulous! Even the surveillance cameras could be hacked! Could it be that the merchants had stolen their own surveillance cameras? There was a problem with the food in their restaurant, so they made it up and said that the surveillance cameras had been hacked!””

“Lin Sha felt that what Zou Feifei said made sense. She looked up at ye Zao and said, “Zao Zao, don’t You Think So?””

“Ye Zao smiled faintly and said, “This kind of thing can only be concluded after the police restore the surveillance cameras.””

“That’s true.”Lin Sha nodded.

The three of them talked while walking.

“After returning to the hotel, Zou Feifei was worried. He sent a wechat message to ask the other party if the hacked surveillance cameras would be restored.”

“After a while, the other party replied, [ don’t worry, they won’t. ]”

“Seeing this reply, Zou feifei heaved a sigh of relief.”

It was good that it didn’t happen.

She was really afraid that the police would really restore the surveillance cameras.

“After chatting, Zou Feifei deleted the chat records on wechat.”

On the other side.

Lin Sha came out of the bathroom after taking a shower.

“Ye Zhuo asked, “Sister Sha Sha, how are you feeling now? Are you feeling unwell?””

“”No, I’m fine.”Lin Shasha smiled and said, “With a great doctor like you around, how could I be feeling unwell?””

“”That’s good,”ye Zhuo said.”

“Lin Shasha continued, “Zhuo Zhuo, are you suspecting Zou Feifei?””

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“”It can’t be her, right?”Lin Shasha continued, “I think she’s a good person. Besides, she doesn’t have to do this! I don’t have any enmity with her.””

Lin Sha couldn’t figure out Zou Feifei’s motive for doing this.

“”You can’t judge a book by its cover,”ye Zhuo said while tapping on the keyboard, “She must have a reason for doing this.””

Lin Sha frowned.

“The next second, the progress bar on the computer screen, which was originally only 30% , suddenly became 100% !”

The restoration was complete.

Ye Zhuo clicked on the video play button.

“Seeing the scene of Lin Sha going to the bathroom, he pressed the pause button. “Sister Sha Sha, come here.””

“What’s Wrong?”Lin Sha walked over curiously.

Ye Zhuo pressed the play button. “Look here.”

“What’s wrong here?”Lin Sha asked curiously.

“Look down.”Ye Zhuo’s red lips opened slightly.

Lin Sha nodded.

The scene continued to play.

“After Lin Sha walked into the bathroom, Zou Feifei quickly took out a pill from his pocket and put it into Lin Sha’s Drink Cup. He also quickly picked up the cup and shook it.”

The white pill quickly melted into the water.

“Seeing this scene, Lin Sha’s eyes widened in disbelief. She never dreamed that Zou Feifei would put something in her drink.”

Scary!

Too scary!

“At this moment, Lin Sha suddenly remembered something and continued, “No wonder when we left, she said that she didn’t finish her drink! I saw that she was drinking, so I drank mine too!””

“But she didn’t think much of it. Now that she thought about it, Zou Feifei was simply too scheming!”

Ye Zao was right. Zou Feifei had been approaching her with a purpose from the beginning.

But why did Zou Feifei do that!

What was her motive?

“Lin Sha continued, “Zao, let’s hurry and give these things to the police!””

“”If you want to get a conviction, these things are useless.”What if Lin Sha said that the particles thrown in were sugar pills?”

“What else do you want?”Lin Sha asked.

Ye Zao clicked the mouse. “Wait a little longer.”

“Five minutes later, ye Zao successfully hacked into the other party’s IP, hacked into wechat, and successfully found the wechat chat history between him and Zou Feifei.”

“I found it.”

“What did you find?”Lin Sha asked.

“Ye Zao said, “I sent a screenshot to your wechat.””

“Lin Sha opened wechat and saw the screenshot. She was so angry that her face turned pale. “This Zou Feifei, I trusted her so much! How could she treat me like this! Let’s Go! Zao Zao, let’s go to the police station now.””

“”I have already sent the evidence to the police station,”ye Zhonghua said.”

“”Zhonghua, thank you. If it weren’t for you, I would have missed the exam today!”Lin Sha looked at ye Zhonghua.”

“”Sister Sha Sha, what are you talking about!”Ye Zhonghua smiled and said, “We are friends.””
