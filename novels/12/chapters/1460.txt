“”It’s fine, it’s fine.”Auntie Sun smiled. “It’s been so many years. I’ve long forgotten about it. Maybe it’s because that child isn’t fated to be with me.” ”

“At this point, Auntie Sun sighed softly. “There’s always something in life, but there’s always something in life. Don’t force it!” ”

“Hearing this, Xia Xiaoman’s heart instantly turned cold. ”

“Perhaps not having a child with Lin Qingxuan was her life. “Auntie Sun, you’re right. Perhaps, this is life!” ”

“Auntie sun immediately said, “Madam, I didn’t mean that! I was talking about myself, I wasn’t talking about you. You’re So Rich, you’ll definitely have your own child with Sir.” ”

“Money? What’s the use of money? Can you use money to buy a child?”Xia Xiaoman said with a smile.

“Auntie sun continued, “Madam, although money is useless, you can’t do without it. The poor envy the rich. It’s better to have money than to have no money.” ”

“After saying that, auntie sun continued, “By the way, Madam, I want to talk to you about something.” ”

“Xia Xiaoman picked up the medicine, blew on it, and then said, “Go ahead.” ”

“Auntie sun said, “Isn’t the family still lacking an hour of work? “It just so happens that my daughter has a school holiday these few days, so I want her to come over and give it a try. The children nowadays aren’t like us back then. They haven’t experienced any hardships. I want to let her know that this money isn’t that easy to earn.” ”

“Sure.”Xia Xiaoman nodded. “Let her come over.”

“”Thank you, Madam, thank you, Madam!”Auntie Sun couldn’t help but bend over. ”

“Xia Xiaoman said, “You’re welcome. By the way, how old is Your Daughter?” ” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“”23,”Auntie Sun answered. ”

“”She’s three years older than my daughter. She should be graduating from college soon, right?”Xia Xiaoman asked. ”

Auntie Sun shook her head. “My daughter was very stupid when she was young. She stayed in primary school for a few years and only went to college today.”

“OH.”Xia Xiaoman drank a mouthful of medicine.

Auntie Sun immediately passed the candied fruit to her.

“After drinking the medicine and eating breakfast, Xia Xiaoman went to work. ”

Auntie Sun and a group of servants began to clean up.

“Although Auntie Sun was highly appreciated by Xia Xiaoman and Lin Qingxuan, she did not put on airs in front of the other servants. Instead, she was very amiable and smiled at everyone. Therefore, everyone liked her, when they heard that her daughter was going to work here as a part-time worker, everyone welcomed her. ”

“At this moment, Auntie Sun’s phone rang. ”

“Auntie sun said, “It must be my daughter calling.” ”

She took out her phone and saw that the person calling was Sun Jiayi.

“”Hello, Jiayi! Okay, I’ll come out to pick you up right away!” ”

“After hanging up the phone, Auntie Sun came out of the door. ”

“Carrying her bag, Sun Jiayi stood outside the door. ”

“The 23-year-old Sun Jiayi had dyed yellow hair, wavy curls, and an exaggerated round earring. She looked slightly older than her actual age. In short, she didn’t look like a 23-year-old girl. ”

“Jiayi!”Auntie Sun ran over.

“Sun Jiayi looked at the surrounding environment and spat, “What kind of lousy place is this! There’s not even a bus, and rich people live in this kind of place?” ”

The villa that Lin Qingxuan bought was located halfway up the mountain.

“It was an authentic Pan Shan apartment. After buying the apartment, Lin Qingxuan bought the entire mountain for the sake of peace. Therefore, in the entire large villa area, only the Lin family lived in an elegant environment with beautiful mountains and rivers, it just looked a little desolate. ”

“”What do you know!”Auntie Sun lowered her voice and said, “When you took the bus, did you see this mountain?” ”

“Yes.”Sun Jiayi nodded.

“Auntie sun continued, “This entire mountain belongs to Mr. Lin.” ”

An entire mountain?

“The average house price in the capital was around 80,000 yuan per square meter. ”

Sun Jiayi could not imagine how much it would cost to buy a mountain on the busy roads in the capital.

Amazing.

It was really too amazing!

“Sun Jiayi said in disbelief, “Really?” ”

“”This child! Why would I lie to You?”Auntie Sun pulled on Sun Jiayi’s hand. “Quickly follow me in. Remember to call someone to find out later, okay?” ”

“”I know. How Annoying!”Sun Jiayi said, “How many times have you repeated it at home!” ”

“Am I not afraid that you will forget?”

The mother and daughter walked into the hall together.

“At this moment, Sun Jiayi’s eyes lit up. ”

“At this moment, there were only two words in her mind ”

The imperial palace.

“Other than the imperial palace, she couldn’t think of anything else. ”

She originally thought that the Lin family’s villa in the Deep Mountains and forests would definitely be nothing to look at.

She didn’t expect that the villa would actually be decorated so luxuriously.

She even saw a painting in the corridor that she could only see in the history books.
