Translator: 549690339

“After ten years, man Jiangshan and Zhao Dan had grown old! ”

“Besides, they were both people who cared the most about their reputation. They were the top people in Manxing country. If they were to be locked up in prison for ten years, they wouldn’t be able to stand it. ”

“Master Cao frowned slightly, “Mister and madam have committed unforgivable mistakes. A prince who breaks the law is as guilty as a commoner. Xing ‘er, if you want to succeed, you can’t let this matter become your burden. “What you need to do now is not to think of a way to bail them out, but to face the people and apologize to them!” ”

Blindly whitewashing the manjiang-shan couple would only increase the disgust of the people.

“At this point, the Manjiang-shan couple could not whitewash it at all. ”

“”Master, do you mean to let me watch them go to jail without doing anything?”Manxing looked at master Cao, his eyes full of disbelief. ”

Master Cao nodded.

“At this time, not only could man Xing not interfere with the affairs of man Jiangshan and Zhao Dan, but he also had to try his best to distance himself from them. He could not bring trouble upon himself. ”

“”But they are my parents!”MAN XING continued, “Their only hope now is me, I...” ”

“Master Cao interrupted man Xing, “Xing ‘er, people who achieve great things have no feelings! After the founding of the Ming dynasty, how many heroes did Zhu Yuanzhang kill to serve him?” ”

“Master...”

“Master Cao Sighed, “I know this is very difficult for you, but you have to do this. “Xing ‘er, you have to get used to everything. This is just the beginning. You will face more choices in the future. One wrong step leads to another. Once you make a mistake, you will never be able to turn back!” ”

Man Xing felt very painful in her heart.

“Man Jiangshan and Zhao Dan were her biological parents. As a daughter, she could not watch her biological parents suffer and not care about them. ”

“However, what master Cao said made sense. ”

“If she made the wrong choice at this time, she would never be able to turn back. ”

“On one side was her parents, and on the other side was power. ”

How was she going to choose?

“”Xing ‘er, you’ve been working hard for nineteen years. Are you going to give up at this critical moment?”Master Cao continued. ” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Man Xing turned to look at master Cao. “Master, isn’t there a way to get the best of both worlds?” ”

Master Cao shook his head.

“A moment later, master Cao said, “Unless...” ”

“Unless what?”Man Xing immediately asked.

“Master Cao said, “Unless the full moon did not die, unless you can overthrow the previous evidence!” ”

“A person can not be resurrected after death. The evidence has been verified by an authority. How can it be easily overturned?”Man Xing asked back.

“Master Cao nodded, “It’s good that you understand this principle! So there is only one path in front of you.” ”

How could there be so many ways to get the best of both worlds?

Man Xing sighed.

“Seeing that the disciple that he had groomed was actually so indecisive and did not have the slightest bit of determination of a superior, a disappointed light flashed across master Cao’s eyes. “Think about it carefully and give me an answer once you’ve thought it through.”With that, master Cao turned around and left. ”

“Looking at Master Cao’s back view, man Xing hurriedly said, “Master, Wait!” ”

Master Cao stopped and looked back. “What’s Wrong?”

“I’ve thought it through!”

A smile appeared on Master Cao’s lips. “Have you really thought it through?”

“Yes.”Man Xing nodded. “I’ll listen to Master.”

As for her parents...

Ten years was just a blink of an eye.

She would send someone to the prison to tell them not to be anxious.

“Master Cao nodded in satisfaction. “Xing ‘er, that’s right. After so many years, you will definitely thank yourself for who you are now.” ”

“”The person I should be thanking more should be you, master,”man Xing looked at master Cao and said. ”

“The corners of master Cao’s mouth curled up into a loving smile. He patted man Xing’s head and said, “Master is very happy today. Xing ‘er, you have finally grown up.” ”

“If one wanted to become a superior, there was one thing that one had to give up. ”

Compassion.

There was no superior who did not climb up slowly by stepping on bones.

“”There is one more thing,”master Cao continued. ”

“”Master, please speak,”Manxing said. ”

“Master Cao said, “Come close to my ear.” ”

Manxing did as he was told.

Master Cao whispered in Manxing’s ear.

“After saying that, man Xing frowned slightly and said in a pale voice, “Master...” ”

“Master Cao shook his head and made a gesture of silence, “Xing ‘er, you have to do this now. Only when they are gone can you get out of the mud without getting dirty.” ”

“But...”

“”Don’t worry, I will arrange it well. No one will find out anything.”Master Cao continued, “They are all extremely shameless people. What we are doing is a kind of relief for them.” ”
