“In Tang Xue’s eyes, Cen Shaoqing was the supreme existence. ”

“At the same time, Cen Shaoqing was also the person she had always admired. ”

“In her opinion, it should be ye Zhuo who should curry favor with Cen Shaoqing. ”

“After all, Cen Shaoqing’s status was noble. ”

How did it become CEN Shaoqing who curry favor with Ye Zhuo Now?

Leader?

A leader was the way a subordinate addressed a superior.

Could Ye Zao be worthy of Cen Shaoqing’s title of leader?

“This title of Leader made Tang Xue Feel a little uncomfortable, and her face turned slightly pale. ”

“Hopefully, Cen Shaoqing’s feelings for ye Zao only lasted for three minutes. ”

“Tang Xue suppressed the messy thoughts in her heart and took a few steps forward. She smiled and said, “Miss Ye, remember to come to the base often when you have time.” ”

Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Tang Xue took out her phone and continued, “Oh right, Miss Ye, shall we add Wechat?” ”

“Tang Xue wanted to approach ye Zao Step by step and get to know ye Zao. If possible, she even wanted to become good friends with Ye Zao. ”

“The first step to becoming good friends was, of course, to add wechat. ”

Ye Zhuo would be eighteen or nineteen years old at most this year.

Most children of eighteen or nineteen years old were more naive and liked to share their thoughts with others.

It just so happened that Tang Xue was addressed as a caring elder sister in the experimental base.

Perhaps.

She could give ye Zhuo some pointers when he was confused.

“Ye Zhuo declined politely. “I’m sorry, my phone is out of battery.”Ye Zhuo did not have many good friends in his previous life. In this life, she did not refuse to make friends, but she could not like Tang Xue. ”

“With regards to people she did not like, Ye Zhuo did not even bother to brush them off. ”

His phone was out of battery?

All he needed to do to add wechat was to report his phone number. What did it have to do with his phone running out of battery?

“Tang Xue was not a fool. She could naturally understand the meaning behind ye Zhuo’s words. “Alright, next time then.” ”

Ye Zhuo smiled faintly.

Cen Shaoqing greeted elder Zhao and left the experimental base with Ye Zhuo.

Tang Xue looked at the backs of the two of them and her expression was very ugly.

She originally wanted to find a time to invite ye Zao out for tea after adding ye Zao’s wechat.

She did not expect ye Zao to reject her.

“In the experimental base, Tang Xue was very popular. ”

“Even professor Yue, who was so serious, praised her endlessly. ”

But today.

Ye Zao actually rejected her.

“From the beginning to the end, she was very respectful to ye Zhuo and did not do anything that made ye Zhuo dislike her. ”

Why would ye Zhuo reject her goodwill?

“”Sister Xue, What’s Wrong?”Cen Jiang saw that Tang Xue was in a daze and asked. ”

“Nothing.”Tang Xue withdrew her gaze.

“Cen Jiang continued, “Sister Xue, do you feel that Fifth Master is a good match for Miss Ye?” ”

“Yes.”Tang Xue’s lips curled into a stiff smile as she nodded.

“”I really hope that master five can bring miss ye around the base more in the future. It would be even better if Miss Ye could join our laboratory!”Cen Jiang was very much looking forward to ye Zhuo joining the laboratory, “Sister Xue, do you wish for Miss Ye to join us?” ”

“Ye Zhuo had yet to join the laboratory and Cen Jiang had already gone crazy. If ye Zhuo joined the laboratory, wouldn’t Cen Jiang Go Crazy? ”

“Tang Xue said softly, “Miss Ye is a talent. Of course, I hope that Miss Ye can join our laboratory.” ”

“Cen Jiang said with a face full of longing, “If only master five could think like us.” ”

Tang Xue smiled.

“Cen Hai added from the side, “Our laboratory is so tiring. Master five would definitely not be willing to let miss ye come over.” ”

“That’s true.”Cen Jiang nodded with a face full of regret.

On the other side.

Cen Shaoqing and ye Zao got into the car.

Cen Shaoqing turned to look at ye Zao. “Are we going to watch a movie now?”

“Sure.”Ye Zao took out his phone. “Let me see if there are any good movies.”

“At this moment, Cen Shaoqing seemed to have suddenly thought of something and continued, “Shall we watch a horror movie?” ”

“”Sure.”Ye Zao continued, “Let me see if there are any horror movies.” ”

“”I think there’s a movie called Ghost Next Door That’s not bad,”Cen Shaoqing continued. ”

“”Let me see.”Ye Zao looked at his phone and continued, “Then let’s watch ghost next door.” ”

“Soon, they arrived at the cinema. ”

“At 4:30 in the afternoon, there was a long queue at the entrance of the cinema to collect tickets. ”

“Cen Shaoqing turned to look at ye Zao. “Leader, please sit here for a while. I’ll go and line up to collect the tickets.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and found an empty seat in the rest area to sit down.

“After sitting down, Ye Zhuo took out his wireless headphones. Pleasant music came out of the headphones, blocking the noise from the outside world. ”
