“”Okay, okay! Then thank you, Aunty!”Li Yueyue was forthright and never beat around the bush. ”

They went back together.

“Today, the driver drove here. ”

The extended Lincoln.

Seeing this car.

Li Yueyue was a little surprised.

The price of this extended Lincoln was around eight figures.

Li Yueyue couldn’t help but recall the first day she met ye Zao.

She said that her uncle was a courier.

Her mother was a caterer.

As for her father who came back later.

Ye Zao said that he sold furniture.

If the situation was really as ye Zao said.

Could their family afford Lincoln?

Could they afford a driver?

It seemed that her roommate was also keeping a low profile.

The driver opened the car door.

Ye Zhuo and Li Yueyue sat in the back seat.

“Lin Ze, Ye Shu, and Lin Jincheng sat in the front seat. ”

“Not long after, they arrived at the Lin family’s manor. ”

“Ye Zhuo pulled Li Yueyue and introduced the manor’s branch to her. “I live in the east wing with my parents and my brother. My fourth uncle temporarily lives in the north wing, and my grandmother lives in the west wing.” ”

“Li Yueyue asked in surprise, “You have a grandmother?” ”

“”Yes.”Ye Zhuo continued, “She raised my brother.” ”

What a coincidence.

“At this moment, Aunt Zhang helped Old Lady Lin to walk over. ”

“Is that your grandmother?”Li Yueyue asked.

“Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and said in a low voice, “My grandmother is the same as Feng Xianxian. She’s a bit snobbish. If you say something unpleasant later, don’t take it to heart.” ”

“OH.”

“After saying that, ye Zao brought Li Yueyue to Old Lady Lin. “Grandmother, this is my classmate, Li Yueyue.” ”

“No matter how much Old Lady Lin disliked ye Zao, she would not show it in front of outsiders. ”

The bigger picture still had to be taken into consideration.

“Moreover, this person was ye Zao’s classmate. ”

Ye Zao had one identity as a doctor.

Perhaps Li Yueyue was also a doctor!

People in the science and technology world could not be offended.

What if they could kick ye Zao out and help Feng Xianxian develop her network.

“”Hello, Grandma,”Li Yueyue greeted her. ”

“Hello.”Old Mrs. Lin nodded and a kind smile appeared on her face. “Are you and Zao Zao University classmates?”

“”Yes.”Li Yueyue felt that old Mrs. Lin was a very kind old woman, which was somewhat different from what ye Zao had described. ”

Could it be that there was some misunderstanding between the grandfather and grandson?

“”Then you must be a talent in the science and Technology World, right?”Old Mrs. Lin continued to ask. ”

Li Yueyue shook her head in embarrassment. “I’m not as smart as Zao Zao.”

Not in the science and Technology World?

“The smile on Old Mrs. Lin’s face disappeared a little, and she continued to say, “Then where are you from?” ”

“I’m from the Prairie.”

The grasslands?

Wasn’t that just a savage land?

“Then who are your parents?”

“Li Yueyue said, “My family raises sheep. My parents raise sheep too.” ”

Raise sheep?

Wasn’t that what a herdsman was?

The little smile on Old Madam Lin’s face disappeared completely in an instant.

Ye Zhuo was indeed a dog that could not change its ways!

“He was in the aristocratic circle and was even a great doctor. Yet, he was actually hanging out with the daughter of a herdsman. ”

She even invited people to her house!

She was not afraid of dirtying the Lin family’s doorsill.

“As expected, a tanuki cat was a tanuki cat! ”

“Even if she was dressed in a dragon robe, she did not look like a crown prince! ”

It was embarrassing.

“Looking at Old Mrs. Lin’s expression, which was faster than flipping through a book, Li Yueyue was stunned. ”

“At first, she thought that ye Zao had some misunderstanding with old Mrs. Lin. ”

“Now, it seemed that ye Zao was absolutely right. ”

This old lady was really too terrifying!

Li Yueyue tugged on ye Zao’s sleeve.

“Ye Zao continued, “I’ll bring my classmate back to the east wing first.” ”

“After saying that, he pulled Li Yueyue and walked to the other side. ”

“When they could no longer see Old Lady Lin’s back, Li Yueyue patted her chest and said, “D * MN! Big Zao Zao, your grandmother is too scary!” ”

“Old Lady Lin’s cheekbones were very high. She was old and there was no collagen on her face. The moment her face completely collapsed, it was truly terrifying. ”

“Is she really your biological grandmother?”

Ye Zao nodded slightly. “She’s the real deal.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Li Yueyue sighed. “Then it’s a miracle that your brother was not raised by her!”

It was said that the apple does not fall far from the tree.

It was unbelievable that Lin Ze could still be so outstanding under the teachings of Old Lady Lin!

“I also think that it’s not easy for my brother.”

Lin Ze had stayed by Old Lady Lin’s side for nineteen years. It was indeed a miracle that he was not influenced by Old Lady Lin.

...

“Old Lady Lin looked in the direction where ye Zhuo and Li Yueyue had left and frowned. After a moment, she turned to look at Aunt Zhang. “Go and call Jin city over for me!” ”
