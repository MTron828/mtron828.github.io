“Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “Everyone has to die. Everyone has to experience it. What’s there to be afraid of!” ”

“At this point, old Mrs. Cen continued, “Everyone says that good people live a long life. Your stepmother has done some wicked things. She definitely won’t live as long as me! Perhaps, I can even send her off!” ”

Zhou Xiang nodded in agreement.

“Walking out of old Madam Cen’s room, Zhou Xiang was called to Xie Wanqiu’s room. ”

“Zhou Xiang walked over to Xie Wanqiu’s side. “Mom, you called for me.” ”

“Xie wanqiu nodded. “Let me ask you. I’ve been coming to your house for so many days. Why haven’t the four girls, Yuying and Yuaya, shown their faces?” ”

“Zhou Xiang said, “I haven’t had the chance to tell them yet!” ”

“Xie wanqiu glanced at Zhou Xiang. “I thought it was because of the four of them, but it turns out it’s because of you as a mother!” ”

“Zhou Xiang explained, “Mom, Yuyan is currently living abroad. The second girl, Yuaya, is also on a business trip in Paris.” ”

“What about Yuying and Yuying?”Xie wanqiu asked.

“Zhou Xiang said, “I’ll tell them right away.” ”

“Xie wanqiu nodded and continued, “What about Shaoqing’s girlfriend? What’s her name? Ye Something?” ”

“”Ye Zao,”Zhou Xiang said. ”

“”Yes, it’s her! Why didn’t she come to see me?”She was Cen Shaoqing’s grandmother. If ye Zao wanted to marry into the Cen family, he had to go through her. ”

But Ye Zao was great!

“Up until now, he had not even shown his face. ”

“Zhou Xiang felt a headache coming. “Mom, Shaoqing is not at home right now, so it’s not convenient for Zao to come alone. Besides, Zao is quite busy!” ”

“”Busy?”Xie wanqiu looked at Zhou Xiang. “Are you not taking me, your elder, seriously because you’re busy?” ”

What was there to be busy about for a girl!

“If a girl was busy, how could a man be busy? ”

“Zhou xiang continued, “Don’t worry. When Shaoqing comes back, he will definitely bring Zao to see you.” ”

“Xie Wanqiu was very dissatisfied. “You’re a mother-in-law. Why Can’t you show the courage of a mother-in-law? Being controlled by a little girl like this, I think you will be like this for the rest of your life!” ”

“Zhou Xiang liked ye Zhuo very much. She could not bear to see Xie wanqiu talk about ye Zhuo like that. “Mom, burning is a very good person! Don’t say that!” ”

“”I think you don’t even care about me as your mother anymore!”Xie wanqiu snorted coldly and continued, “You can leave First!” ”

“After all, she was not her biological daughter. ”

It was normal for her to not be so considerate.

Zhou Xiang did not say anything more and turned around to walk out.

Xie wanqiu looked at Zhou Xiang’s back and her eyes were filled with darkness.

B * Tch!

Putting on airs as a rich lady in front of her?

“If it was not for her, Zhou Xiang would have died long ago! ”

She did not have the slightest bit of gratitude.

“Second aunt.”Zhou Xiang had just walked to the corner of the stairs when she saw Zheng Wanyin walking upstairs with exquisite snacks in her hands.

“”Wanyin, why aren’t you sleeping at this time of Night?”Zhou Xiang asked. ”

“Zheng wanyin smiled and said, “I have nothing to do at home, so I studied the cooking of hibiscus cakes online. I just made it and was about to bring it up for you to try.” ”

“The Zheng family was the same as the Zhou family, having a hundred-year-old scholarly pedigree. ”

“Therefore, Zheng Wanyin had been practicing zither, chess, calligraphy, and painting since she was young. ”

She had even read ‘virtuous women’and ‘virtuous women’s ring’several times.

“Nowadays, there were very few girls like Zheng Wanyin who followed the virtuous women’s principles. ”

“Zhou Xiang said in surprise, “You made this yourself?” ”

“”Yes.”Zheng wanyin nodded and handed the tray to Zhou Xiang. “Second aunt, please try it.” ”

“Zhou Xiang picked up a piece of hibiscus cake. It was soft, glutinous, and sweet. It melted in her mouth. “It’s not bad.” ”

“After receiving Zhou Xiang’s praise, Zheng Wanyin was very happy. “Try another piece.” ”

Zhou Xiang picked up another piece. “Good! I’m sure you’ll like this too.”

Ye Zao loved desserts the most.

And he didn’t get fat.

This was what Zhou Xiang envied the most.

“Zheng wanyin asked curiously, “Second aunt, are you talking about your future cousin-in-law?” ”

“Yes.”Zhou Xiang nodded. “Your cousin-in-law really likes to eat desserts.”

“Really?”Zheng Wanyin asked.

How many girls nowadays really liked to eat desserts?

Weren’t they afraid of gaining weight?

Many of them were just putting on airs in front of outsiders.

“If ye Zhuo really liked to eat desserts, then it was really not simple. ”

“Yes.”

“Zheng wanyin sighed and said, “I used to think that cousin would really die alone for the rest of his life. I didn’t expect that he would be conquered by cousin-in-law. Cousin-in-law must be a very outstanding person!” ” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“In the past, Cen Shaoqing ate vegetarian and prayed to Buddha. ”

“Every time he came to the CEN residence, as long as Cen Shaoqing was at home, he would be able to hear the music of the ‘Curse of Great Sorrow’in the hall. ”
