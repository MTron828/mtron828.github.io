“Ye Zao.”

“Gu Zuocheng nodded. “Go to the side and rest for a while.”After saying that, he turned around and said to the other students, “Let’s continue!” ”

Song Ruxue was stunned.

The other people who were waiting to watch ye Zao’s show were also stunned.

They originally thought that ye Zao was a piece of scrap metal.

They did not expect that this person was actually a King!

It was not until five o’clock in the evening that the day’s military training ended.

Li Yueyue held ye Zao’s hand and returned to the dormitory. “Zao Zao! You were really too cool today! You Don’t even know how wonderful King Gu’s expression was back then!”

“”Just average, third place in the world.” ”

The two of them said as they returned to the dormitory.

Feng Xianxian and Bai Xiaoman were not in the dormitory.

“Li Yueyue started to remove her makeup. “Zhuozhuo, let’s go out for dinner after we shower. I haven’t eaten outside of school yet!” ”

“Ye Zhuozhuo nodded slightly. “Alright, I’ll go take a shower first.” ”

“After Li Yueyue removed her makeup, she went to the bathroom to wash her face. At this moment, she accidentally kicked over Feng Xianxian’s personal trash can. ”

“In order to show that she was different from them, the trash can that Feng Xianxian used was a famous luxury brand. There was even a layer of gold foil on the outside of the trash can. ”

It looked very high and mighty.

Li Yueyue quickly squatted on the ground to pick up the trash.

“Just as she was throwing the trash away, Li Yueyue saw a familiar thing in the deepest part of the trash can. ”

That was —

The milk slice that she gave Feng Xianxian!

Li Yueyue did not mind the dirt. She directly reached into the trash can and took out the bag.

As expected.

This whole bag was filled with milk slices that she gave Feng Xianxian.

“In an instant, the smile on Li Yueyue’s face disappeared without a trace, and her anger rose in all directions! ”

These milk slices were all made by Li Yueyue’s mother personally.

They were all natural and did not have any additions.

“In Li Yueyue’s eyes, these were priceless treasures. ”

“After all, her mother usually did not make things easily. ”

“Feng Xianxian could not accept her things, and she could also despise her. However, she should not accept them and throw them into the trash can in the blink of an eye after accepting them. ”

This was a form of disrespect!

“Li Yueyue hugged the bag of milk slices and was so angry that her whole body was trembling. After a long while, she stood up from the ground, peeled a piece of milk slice, put it into her mouth, and then put the rest of the milk slices into the cabinet. ”

Ye Zao’s cabinet was right next to hers.

“Through the transparent glass, one could see that ye Zao had already eaten more than half of the milk slices. ”

“Not long after, Ye Zao came out of the bathroom after taking a shower. “Yueyue, do you want to take a shower?” ”

“Right away!”Li Yueyue carried her pajamas and walked out of the bathroom.

“While Li Yueyue was taking a shower, ye Zao turned on the computer and checked Zhang Dahai’s situation. ”

“According to the monitor, Zhang Dahai did not give up on investigating her and Ye Shu. ”

Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly and checked the chat records of Zhang Dahai’s major communication tools through the monitor.

“At this moment, ye Zao found a person named ‘waiting for a city’on Zhang Dahai’s wechat list. Something was not right. ”

Waiting for a city?

Who Was this person?

“At the same time, the door of the dormitory was opened from the outside. ”

Feng Xianxian and Bai Xiaoman walked in from the outside.

“”Xianxian, the culinary skills of the three-star Michelin restaurant’s chef are really too good! I’ve never eaten such delicious foie gras! And that sashimi is also not bad!” ”

“Feng Xianxian smiled and said, “If you like it, I’ll bring you there next time.” ”

Bai Xiaoman did not expect to have a surprise. “Really?”

“Of course it’s true.”

“As she spoke, Feng Xianxian’s gaze swept past ye Zao. ”

“She saw ye Zao sitting in front of the computer, constantly typing on a black screen. ” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

He turned a deaf ear to their words.

Feng Xianxian curled her lips.

“Ye Zao was faking it, right? ”

“A bumpkin from the countryside had never been to a three-star Michelin restaurant. Now, ye Zao must be very jealous of her. ”

What a pity.

Some statuses could not be jealous.

She was born to be the eldest daughter of the Lin family.

“After a while, Li Yueyue came out of the bathroom. “Zao Zao, let’s Go Eat.” ”

“Feng Xianxian held a handbag and stood next to Li Yue Yue with a smile. “Yue Yue, thank you for the milk. This is a return gift I prepared for you! ZY’s latest temperature-adjustable air-conditioner.” ”

Feng Xianxian did not really want to be friends with Li Yue Yue.

She just wanted to bribe Li Yue Yue so that Li Yue and Bai Xiaoman would be on her side and isolate ye Zhuluo together!

Isolation was the most terrifying cold violence!

She had to let ye Zao know what it meant to be a noble in the capital!

Those who offended her would not have a good ending.
