Although he did not want to admit that ye Zao had been resurrected.

The truth was right before his eyes.

“Other than ye Zao, who else would have the ability to do so ”

“”Ha...”hearing this, the great witch doctor laughed out loud. ”

“Autumn flute and autumn town, the father and daughter, looked at each other. No one understood what the Great Witch Doctor meant. ”

“After a while, the great witch doctor raised his eyes and looked at the father and daughter. His eyes were filled with viciousness. “Ye Zao wants to be reborn? In Your Next Life!” ”

“In this life, ye Zao could only be treated as a dead person. ”

“Qiu Chang Zhen immediately said, “You mean, ye Zao did not come back to life?” ”

“”Old Mister Qiu, Don’t you think your idea is ridiculous?”The Great Witch Doctor asked. ”

“Qiu Changzhen said, “Then could it be that ye Zao was faking his own death?” ”

“If ye Zao had faked his own death in the beginning, then all of this could be explained. ”

“”Impossible!”When ye Zao died, the great witch doctor had specially injected a lethal poison into ye Zao’s body just in case. ”

Ye Zao could not have survived!

“”Then what happened?”Qiu Changzhen continued, “Great Witch Doctor, who do you think has the ability to steal ye Zao’s corpse, and who could take away the clothes spirit from the Qiu family’s confinement room? “Don’t you think that when these two things are linked together, it’s very suspicious?” ”

“What about that ye Han?”The Great Witch Doctor placed the snow rat into a cup of unknown liquid.

“As soon as it was placed in, the snow rat fused with the liquid inside. ”

“Qiu Changzhen’s scalp was slightly numb as he watched, and he continued, “Ye Han is currently at red-blue Mountain.” ”

“”Red-blue Mountain?”The great witch doctor frowned and turned on the equipment at the side. Instantly, a transparent screen appeared in the air. What appeared on the transparent screen was not any other scene, it was the image of Ye Han fighting a level three armored beast with all his might. ”

The background of the image was red and Blue Mountain.

This meant that this matter had nothing to do with Ye Han.

“”Great Witch Doctor, what do you think we should do now?”Autumn town continued to speak. ”

“”If the enemy doesn’t move, I Won’t move,”the Great Witch Doctor continued to speak. “It’s just a few remnants of Ye Zhuo. There’s nothing to be afraid of.” ”

Not many people knew the truth of this matter.

Some of them were silenced by the Great Witch Doctor.

It was normal for there to be a few random bugs that slipped through the net occasionally.

These random bugs could only do small things in the dark and could not threaten them at all.

“Moreover, so what if ye Zao was really resurrected? ”

“Back then, since he could quietly make ye Zao disappear from that experiment, this time, he could also kill ye Zao! ”

Killing ye Zao would be as easy as making an ant?

“Moreover, there was no medicine in this world that could bring people back to life. ”

“Is it really not ye Zao who has been resurrected?”Qiu Changzhen asked worriedly.

“”Old Mister Qiu, do you really want to know whether a dead person can be resurrected?”The Great Witch Doctor looked at Qiu Changzhen. ”

Qiu Changzhen nodded.

“He didn’t want to know, but he was worried and afraid. ”

“It wasn’t easy for the Qiu family to get to where they were today. If ye Zao was resurrected, then everything would be for naught. ”

“Not only would it be for naught, but the QIU family might also disappear from this world. ”

Therefore.

Ye Zao must not be resurrected! Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“The Great Witch Doctor picked up a syringe and squeezed out the excess air in it. Then he said, “It just so happens that I’ve been studying the secrets of the dead for the past few days. Why don’t Old Mister Qiu be experimented on as a sacrifice? What if you were resurrected?” ”

“At the end of his sentence, the great witch doctor walked towards Qiu Changzhen. ”

Qiu Changzhen was so frightened that he kept backing away.

“”No, no, no. Great Witch Doctor, don’t joke about me.”The Great Witch Doctor was a sinister person. He would do anything to achieve his goal. Qiu Changzhen’s face turned pale. “A person’s death is like the extinguishing of a lamp. How could he come back to life?” ”

He did not want to risk his life in order to verify whether ye Zao had really come back to life.

He had yet to see Qiu di take up the position of female sovereign.

“Most importantly, he had yet to see the Qiu family being crowned with the country’s surname. ”

“In short, he could not afford to have anything happen to him right now! ”

“”Since Old Mister Qiu understands this logic, what are you still worried about?”The great witch doctor retorted. ”

“Hearing this, Qiu Changzhen was stunned. ”

What the Great Witch Doctor said seemed to make sense.

“If it really was ye Zao who had returned, based on Ye Zao’s personality, he would have long returned to take revenge. Why wait until now? ”

“Therefore, that person was definitely not ye Zao! ”

“Qiu Changzhen immediately said, “The Great Witch Doctor’s words really woke up the person in the dream. Don’t worry, I know what to do now!” ”
