“Chapter 1099: 243: Master Technology, Control Finance! The all-powerful great burning! 1”

Translator: 549690339

Ye Zao was only 20 years old.

Who would submit to a little girl under President Yu’s command when he had a high position?

It would have been fine if ye Zao had real talent.

“Unfortunately, ye Zao only had a body of skin and only knew a little about scientific research. ”

There were specialties in the field of technology.

This was not the world of technology.

“Even if this was the scientific and technological world, so what? ”

Ye Zhuo had boasted that he would be able to build an aircraft carrier within two years.

Who in the scientific and technological world didn’t despise ye Zhuo at the moment.

Just you wait.

The good show was still to come.

“Thinking of this, Zhao Xueyin slightly curved her lips. She turned around and took out a document from the file cabinet and handed it to Ye Zhuo. “Sister Ye Zhuo, this is the information left behind by President Yu. Take a look.” ”

Ye Zao took the document and quickly flipped through it.

Ten lines at a glance.

The problems left behind by President Yu were not as simple as what Zhao Xueyin had described.

Many problems had been delayed for more than ten years and had yet to be resolved.

“Actually, the position of president was a mess. ”

“Actually, Zhao Xueyin’s motive was very clear. ”

She was waiting to see her make a fool of herself.

“Ye Zao’s brows remained the same. His expression did not change. After a moment, he handed the document to Zhao Xueyin. “I’ve read it well.” ”

“So Fast?”Zhao Xueyin was taken aback.

“Mm.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. There was no expression on his clear face.

“There were more than thirty pages of information in total. Even if one read every page for a minute, it would still take half an hour. ”

How many minutes did ye Zhuo read it?

Not even five minutes.

“Even if you wanted to pretend to be thirteen, you shouldn’t act like that, right? ”

Don’t you know how to act according to one’s ability?

Did you really think that her grandmother had the title of a talented woman in the golden age and that she was also a talented woman?

This kind of person was actually quite disgusting.

“Zhao Xueyin smiled slightly, then she said, “Sister Ye Zao is indeed Aunt Lang’s granddaughter. She really has the style of Aunt Lang back then! “She actually finished reading all the information in less than five minutes. If it were me, with so many things, it would take at least half an hour.” ”

“I’m used to it.”Ye Zao’s tone was indifferent.

“In Ye Zao’s previous world, Ye Zao had lived like this almost every day, so she didn’t think much of it. ”

“Seeing ye Zao like this, the mocking expression on Zhao Xueyin’s face became even more obvious. ”

Heh.

He’s quite confident?

Did she understand what was written on the information?

It had only been two to three minutes. She probably didn’t even know how many pages the information had.

On this document were all the various problems that President Yu had sorted out.

They were just waiting for the next president to deal with them.

“If ye Zao really understood it, his reaction wouldn’t be so calm! ”

Unless ye Zao really had the ability to solve problems.

But...

Did She?

Could she settle all these problems?

Just the transnational cooperation case was enough to give her a headache.

Not to mention two or three minutes.

“Even if ye Zhuo was given two hours, it would be difficult for ye Zhuo to understand what was written in those documents. ”

“Zhao Xueyin herself was a business genius. When she was ten years old, she helped Father Zhao read the documents together. ”

“When she was fifteen years old, she set up Project Z. ”

But even she could not read all the documents in such a short time.

Ye Zhuo could do it?

Why did ye Zhuo have to pretend like this?

Could it be... because of the lawyer?

“Thinking of this, Zhao Xueyin raised her head and looked at the lawyer beside her. ”

She had an answer in her heart.

“Ye Zhuo was trying to attract the lawyer’s attention, right? ”

What was this kind of behavior called?

Scum.

Sea King.

This kind of people were usually very narcissistic. They relied on their good looks to think that all the men in the world should like them.

They were attracted to them.

And then they used the men’s likes to achieve their own goals!

Little did they know.

“In the eyes of others, they were not worth mentioning at all. ”

Would lawyer Si take a liking to a girl like Ye Zhuo?

Absolutely impossible!

Not to mention that lawyer Si had her in his heart now.

Even if lawyer Si did not have her in his heart.

He would not like a girl like ye Zhuo who was pretentious.

Not to mention liking her.

Si lui would not even take a second look at a person like ye Zao! Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Ye Zao thought that he was very good at acting and no one would be able to see through him.

“But who was she, Zhao Xueyin? ”

She saw through ye Zao’s true colors at a glance.

“Zhao Xueyin very well concealed the mocking look in her eyes. She looked at ye Zao and continued, “Sister Ye Zao, you are really amazing! If I had half of your talent, I would not be like this.” ”

These words were full of praise and sarcasm.

“Ye Zao smiled slightly and took all of Zhao Xueyin’s praise. “Thank you, but talent is not something that you can be envious of.” ”

“Her tone was faint, but it was forceful. ”
