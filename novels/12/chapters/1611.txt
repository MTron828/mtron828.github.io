“Tang Xue frowned slightly and continued, “Minister Liu, I do have a cousin named Bai Yun! But she will definitely not cause trouble in the broadcast room!””

Bai Yun had already been arranged internally by her!

Was she so full of herself that she wanted to cause trouble in the broadcast room?

Minister Liu looked at Tang Xue. “Come and take a look and you’ll know!”

Tang Xue nodded and followed minister Liu’s footsteps.

“Bai Yun was sitting in the interrogation room. When she saw Tang Xue coming over, she immediately stood up from her chair and said excitedly, “Sister, you’re here!””

“After saying that, Bai Yun turned around and looked at the other people in the interrogation room, she said proudly, “I knew my cousin would definitely come and save me! You guys are finished! Sister, these people bullied me just now. You Must Get Justice for me!””

“Tang Xue never expected that the person in the interrogation room was really Bai Yun. Her expression turned cold as she continued, “Shut Up!””

Bai Yun was shocked by Tang Xue and immediately shut up.

“Tang Xue turned to look at minister Liu and smiled apologetically, “Minister Liu, I’m really sorry! Bai Yun is indeed my cousin. She’s young and insensible. I’ll apologize for bringing trouble to You!””

“Seeing Tang Xue like this, Bai Yun was displeased. “Sister! Why are you apologizing to her! I’m clearly the one who’s been wronged! Sister, you don’t even know, they’re simply too much...””

“I told you to shut up!”Tang Xue’s eyes were about to spew fire.

Idiot!

She really didn’t know why mother Tang would introduce such an idiot.

“Seeing that Tang Xue was really angry, Bai Yun finally shut up.”

“Tang Xue continued, “Apologize to minister Liu!””

“Bai Yun looked at minister Liu and said unwillingly, “I’m Sorry.””

Bai Yun was very confused.

“Could it be that Tang Xue, a dignified doctor, was not even comparable to the head of the security department?”

She actually wanted her to apologize to the head of the security department!

“In Bai Yun’s eyes, minister Li was not much different from a doorman!” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Minister Liu continued, “Miss Tang, if you are sure that this is your cousin, just sign here and you can take her away!””

“As he said that, minister Liu handed the document and pen to Tang Xue.”

“Tang Xue took the document and pen and signed on it. “Thank you, Minister Liu, for the trouble.””

“Minister Liu said, “Miss Tang, if you hadn’t come here personally, I wouldn’t believe that you have such a cousin! I’ve really opened my eyes today!””

His words were clearly filled with mockery.

She didn’t know what shameful thing Bai Yun had done! To make minister Liu Not give her face.

“Tang Xue put on a fake smile. “I’ve made a fool of myself, Minister Liu!””

“After saying that, Tang Xue turned to look at Bai Yun. “Let’s Go!””

“Bai Yun followed Tang Xue’s footsteps and asked in a low voice, “SIS, isn’t that person just a small minister? Why are you so respectful to him! You’re the youngest female doctor in the base! Don’t Tell Me You’re afraid of Him?””

“”Do you know who minister Liu Is? He is from the PL. He even has the right to directly convict you and put you in jail!”Tang Xue continued, “Let alone me, even if my grandfather is still alive, I have to give minister Liu some face!””

Bai Yun sucked in a breath of cold air. She really didn’t expect that a small minister of security would be so powerful!

No Wonder Tang Xue was so wary of him and so respectful towards Head Liu.

It seemed that the CEN base was indeed different from other places.

“Bai Yun wanted to say something more, but Tang Xue saw through her intentions and continued, “Shut up and don’t speak!””

Bai Yun had no choice but to shut up.

“But in her heart, she was snorting coldly. What was so great about this Tang Xue that she even gave her a look.”

“Along the way, Tang Xue held back her anger and did not make a sound.”

“However, she could clearly feel that wherever people passed by, they would point and point at her and Bai Yun.”

“When they arrived at the office, Tang Xue looked at her assistant. “You go out for a while!””

“”Okay.”The assistant nodded and walked out of the door, closing the office door at the same time.”

“Tang Xue turned to look at Bai Yun and said angrily, “Let me ask you, how did you get brought to the interrogation room by the security team?””

“Speaking of this matter, Bai Yun felt extremely aggrieved, “Sis! I wasn’t even accepted for that assessment! Didn’t you say that you already had a good relationship with the higher-ups? Didn’t you say that I had already been chosen internally? But why didn’t the broadcaster announce my name, and even said that I hadn’t been accepted at all! I couldn’t take it anymore, so I went to look for the broadcaster to argue with him. Who knew that not only did the broadcaster not help me investigate, he even mocked me. In the end, he even called the security team over... ... ..”
