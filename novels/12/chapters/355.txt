Translator: 549690339

“Let me feed you.”Cen Shaoqing picked up Yesen’s bowl.

“My dear uncle, it’s not wrong to curry favor with Yesen. ”

“Seeing this scene, the assistant was stunned. ”

He even thought that he was hallucinating.

“Having been by Cen Shaoqing’s side for so long, he had never seen Cen Shaoqing being so humble. ”

He... he actually had to feed someone else?

Who exactly was this Mr. Ye?

Could he be some invisible big shot?

“Ye Sen hurriedly waved his hand. “No need, no need. I just have a head injury and my hand is fine. I can do it myself.” ”

“With that, he took the bowl from Cen Shaoqing’s hand and began to eat. ”

Cen Shaoqing also began to eat his grass.

“After eating, Cen Shaoqing put down his chopsticks and wiped his mouth with a tissue. “Mr. Ye, I still have some small matters to deal with in the afternoon. Let Little Zhang take care of you here. If you have anything to say, just tell him.” ”

“The assistant immediately stepped forward. “Hello, Mr. Ye. I’m Little Zhang.” ”

Ye Sen also immediately put down his chopsticks. “Then you can go and get busy. Don’t worry about me. Let Little Zhang leave too. I feel like I don’t have anything else to do. I don’t need anyone to take care of me! I can be discharged in the afternoon.”

Ye Sen still had a very important cooperation case to discuss in the afternoon.

He had spent a few days with great difficulty to settle the project manager. He could not let a small injury delay his official business.

“Besides, when he was young, what injury had he not received? ”

Ye Sen really did not care about such a small injury!

“Cen Shaoqing seemed to see through ye Sen’s worries and continued, “You don’t have to worry about the contract. I have already arranged it. In the afternoon, someone will come over to dock with you. You just need to be responsible for signing it.” ”

Ye Sen was stunned.

The contract he wanted to discuss was not a small company.

It was a listed company in Country P.

Cen Shaoqing had arranged it with just one sentence?

So Powerful?

Ye Sen could not help but suspect that Cen Shaoqing was bragging.

“Even if Cen Shaoqing was powerful in China, this was country P after all! ”

Cen Shaoqing could still extend his hand to country P?

Was He that capable?

“Cen Shaoqing then instructed his assistant, Xiao Zhang, “Remember to take good care of Mr. Ye.” ”

“”Okay, don’t worry.”Xiao Zhang nodded respectfully. ”

“Cen Shaoqing stood up and looked at ye Sen. As he counted the Buddha beads, he said, “A concussion is not a small problem. You can rest well and look for Xiao Zhang if you need anything. I’ll be back later.” ”

“Although his tone was indifferent, it carried a sense of deterrence that could not be resisted. ”

“Ye Sen was stunned. For a moment, he could not even say a word of rejection. He could only watch as Cen Shaoqing turned around and left the ward. ”

“Not long after Cen Shaoqing left, Ye Sen wanted to pay for the medical fees and then leave the hospital. ”

“This was country P, not in China. He could not trouble Cen Shaoqing too much. ”

“Little Zhang stopped ye Sen and said with a troubled look, “Mr. Ye, master five specifically told me not to let you leave the hospital. If anything happens to you, I can’t explain it to master five!” ”

“Ye Sen said, “Don’t worry, I will explain it to him clearly and not let him find trouble with you.” ”

“”No, you really can’t leave the hospital.” ”

“At this moment, there was a knock on the door outside the ward. ”

Xiao Zhang walked over to open the door.

He saw two blond-haired and blue-eyed people from country P.

“Xiao Zhang brought the two people in and took the initiative to introduce them to ye Sen. “Mr. Ye, this is Milo, the person in charge of Yuaeon. Regarding the cooperation, you can talk to him directly.” ”

“Milo immediately handed a document to ye sen. he said respectfully, “Hello, Mr. Ye. I’m Milo. This is the contract that I drafted overnight. If there are no problems, you can sign it.” ”

Ye Sen was stunned.

This was Milo.

“Because he had just met Milo three days ago. At that time, Milo was still arrogant and looked down on the Chinese people. He needed to make an appointment three months in advance to see him. Otherwise, there was no deal. ”

“In order to meet Milo, Ye Sen had spent a lot of money. ”

He did not expect Milo to be a different person today!

Ye Sen felt that he was dreaming and secretly pinched his thigh.

It hurt.

It was not a dream!

It really was not a dream! Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Ye Sen then took the contract and flipped through two pages.

“The various treaties on the contract were not only very reasonable, but also gave party B a lot of advantages. ”

“Under normal circumstances, in a multinational cooperation contract, party A’s father would more or less have some overbearing clauses. ”

“Ye Sen frowned slightly and could not help but be curious, what was Cen Shaoqing’s identity? ”

“In a prosperous country like country P, he could do whatever he wanted. ”

His identity was definitely not as simple as a rich second generation.
