“Fat tiger said, “Even brother ZE has found a partner. What should we do?” ”

“Dog two flipped a page of the menu and continued, “Remove the ‘we’, thank you.” ”

Fat Tiger was stunned. “Remove the ‘we’? What does that mean?”

“Li Wen mercilessly mocked, “It means that you’re the only single dog here.” ”

Fat Tiger was so frightened that he stood up from his chair. “You guys have dogs outside too?”

Li Wen didn’t say anything.

Buttface calmly looked at the menu.

Fat Tiger was so anxious that he was red. “Hurry up and say it! Hurry up and say it! Why am I the only single dog here! When did you guys start dating?”

“Li Wen took a sip of his tea and looked up with a smile. “I haven’t even started dating yet. Buttface, you should know! Cousin Ze!” ”

“”An Lizi?”Fat tiger asked, “Did buttface really have a secret relationship with an Lizi?” ”

“What secret relationship? Can you be more civilized? We are unmarried men and women. How could we have a secret relationship?”Buttface turned to look at Fat Tiger.

Fat Tiger was on the verge of tears. “When did this happen? Why didn’t I Know About It? You guys are so bad. You actually went behind my back and fell in love!”

“”I’m going to confess my love next week,”buttface replied. ”

“He and an Lizi had already formed a relationship. Both of them had each other in their hearts. They would say goodnight to each other, but they lacked a sense of ceremony. ”

“Upon hearing this, fat tiger heaved a sigh of relief and said with a smile, “So you haven’t confessed your love yet! I was scared to death!” ”

“After saying this, fat tiger continued, “You haven’t even confessed your love yet. You’re also a single dog.” ”

“I won’t be next week.”There was a smug look on dog two’s face.

“Fat Tiger said unwillingly, “I want to fall in love too. I want to Chase Girls Too!” ”

Dog two looked at him. “Who are you chasing?”

“Hearing that, dog two immediately wilted. ”

That’s right.

Who was he chasing?

He had never met anyone that he particularly liked in his entire life.

“Besides, he was too close to his friends, so there was nothing he could do. ”

Fat Tiger was so angry that he sat down. “I’ll go home and ask my mom to arrange a blind date for me!”

“That’s a good idea.”Dog two nodded.

Li Wen nodded in agreement.

“Before long, Lin Ze and Bai Jingshu had almost finished eating. ”

“Bai Jingshu suggested, “Let’s go watch a movie?” ”

This was the first time Bai Jingshu had made such a request to a boy.

She felt a little uneasy.

“Okay.”Lin Ze nodded. “What movie do you want to watch? I’ll book the tickets.”

Bai Jingshu took out her phone. “You were the one who paid for the meal just now. I’ll buy the movie tickets.”

“That’s fine too.”Lin Ze nodded.

Bai Jingshu opened the booking app and looked up at Lin Ze. “Can I watch a horror movie?”

“”No problem,”Lin ze said. ”

“Bai Jingshu continued, “I think there’s a new horror movie that’s not bad. Why don’t we watch a horror movie?” ”

“Okay.”Lin Ze did not have any objections.

The two of them stood up and set off for the cinema.

The cinema was just in the dining hall. It was just a few steps away. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“On Sunday, there were many people coming to watch the movie, and they were all couples who were in and out. ”

“Bai Jingshu went to get the tickets, and the two of them went to the theater. ”

“Soon, the movie began to play. ”

“The atmosphere in a horror movie was very intense and suspicious. It was a little exciting. Bai Jingshu was very brave, or else she wouldn’t have chosen a horror movie. ”

“However, there were often young couples around who were scared out of their wits. ”

“The couple sitting on Bai Jingshu’s left side, the girl, got into the boy’s arms. Looking at Lin Ze’s side, the two of them could actually see each other kissing while watching a horror movie. ”

“At this moment, Lin Ze suddenly turned around and met Bai Jingshu’s gaze. ”

“Under the not-so-dim lighting, the two of them could clearly see each other’s faces. ”

“Bai Jingshu’s face turned hot and she suddenly felt a little awkward, especially in such an environment. ”

The atmosphere was subtle.

Lin Ze immediately reacted and coughed lightly. “Are you coughing?”

“I’m fine.”Bai Jingshu felt that her voice had changed.

Lin Ze bent his back and stood up. “I’ll go buy some drinks. What do you like to drink?”

“”Anything,”Bai Jingshu said. ”

Lin Ze bent his back and walked out of the broadcast hall.

“Compared to the stuffy broadcast hall, the air inside was much fresher. Lin Ze took a deep breath and walked towards the vending machine that sold milk tea. He chose two cups of pearl milk tea that were more acceptable to girls. ”

“Brother!”

“At this moment, a surprised voice suddenly appeared in the air. ”

Lin Ze turned his head and saw ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing walking over.

“Zhuozhuo.”

“Ye Zhuo walked over with a smile. “Brother, you’re here to watch a movie too?” ”

“”Yes.”Lin Ze nodded. “I’m here with, with an ordinary friend.” ”
