“Yang Wenyin shook her head. “Don’t talk about Qianhua! I even want to see that girl Xianxian! What a good daughter! Compared to that idiot, she’s a hundred times better! Who knows what Jin City is thinking!””

“”Hello, second and third Aunties.””

“Just as they were speaking, a gentle female voice suddenly sounded in the air.”

The two of them looked up and saw that it was Feng Xianxian.

“Feng Xianxian was wearing light makeup tonight. Her fitted cheongsam accentuated her beautiful figure. She looked like a jade from a small family. Her outfit was completely different from her usual outfit, which made people’s eyes light up.”

“Feng Xianxian could feel that from the moment she entered the door, a lot of people were looking at her.”

“In fact, there was no lack of beautiful women in this circle.”

“However, there were very few people who were as beautiful as her.”

“”Isn’t this Xianxian? It’s only been a while, and Xianxian has become prettier again!”Zhang Zhenzhen held Feng Xianxian’s hand, unwilling to let go. She wanted a daughter too much, but unfortunately, all four of them were brats.”

“Looking at Feng Xianxian now, she felt that Feng Xianxian was good in every way.”

“Feng Xianxian smiled and said, “Second aunt, you should be the one who has become younger. I almost didn’t recognize you when you stood with third aunt just now.””

“Yang Wenyin said, “Look at what you said to your child. Am I not young anymore?””

“”Of course you’re Young! Not only are you young, you’re also beautiful! Two Aunties, you usually bring Wen Wen and Tai tai out to play, so you must often be misunderstood as mother and son, right?””

Wen Wen and Tai Tai were the grandsons of Zhang Zhenzhen and Yang Wenyin.

“When they heard this, the two of them were so amused by Feng Xianxian that they could not close their mouths.”

There was no woman who did not like to be praised for being young.

“After saying this, Feng Xianxian continued, “Aunties, has uncle Lin brought his new aunt here?””

Zhang Zhenzhen shook her head. “Not yet. There’s still about half an hour before the appointed auspicious time.”

“”I see.”Feng Qianqian continued, “Then I’ll go in and take a look first. I’ve also prepared a gift for my new sister. I’ll have to arrange for someone to carry it in.””

“”Okay, okay, okay. You Go First.””

“It was also because Feng Qianqian was kind. If it was someone else, they might not have been so magnanimous as to prepare a gift for that idiot.”

“After all, Feng Qianqian had almost taken the position of the Lin family’s eldest daughter.”

Feng Xianxian walked into the banquet hall step by step.

“With every step she took, she could feel more gazes on her.”

“Feng Xianxian raised her chin, her eyes filled with pride. Tonight, she would definitely crush that idiot and become an existence that would amaze everyone.”

“At this moment, there was another commotion at the door, causing all the guests in the banquet hall to look in that direction.”

“Is this the Cen family’s old lady and Cen Fifth Master?”

“Didn’t they say that CEN fifth master is a quiet person and never participates in such banquets?”

Some people at the side whispered amongst themselves.

“Feng Xianxian turned around and her gaze was immediately attracted by the Lanzhi Jade Tree’s figure in the crowd. For a moment, she was actually stunned.”

She remembered that the last time she saw CEN fifth master was two years ago.

“At that time, she had already felt that fifth master Cen was an amazing person.”

“When they met again, the shock he gave her was no less than two years ago.”

Feng Xianxian pursed her lips.

Everyone said that fifth master Cen did not like to attend banquets.

“Then, why did fifth master Cen make an exception this time?”

Could it be... because of her?

“After all, Old Lady Lin had just mentioned the matter between her and fifth master Cen in front of Old Lady Cen last time.”

Then fifth master Cen must have come to see her today.

“Thinking of this, Feng Xianxian’s cheeks flushed red and her heart beat faster.”

“Tonight, she would definitely not let fifth master Cen Down!”

Definitely Not!

“”Xianxian, this qipao of yours looks really good tonight? Where did you buy it? Tell me, I’ll go buy one too.”A few girls who were close to Feng Xianxian walked over.”

Feng Xianxian came back to her senses and smiled. “My grandmother custom-made it for me in Little Jiangnan. You Can’t buy it outside.”

“Of course, these people knew that the grandmother Feng Xianxian was referring to was Old Lady Lin.”

“After all, Old Lady Lin usually treated Feng Xianxian like her eyeballs hurt.”

“Although Lin Jincheng was about to acknowledge his biological daughter, an idiot wouldn’t pose much of a threat to Feng Xianxian.”

“As for the Weakling’s biological mother, she was no match for Feng Qianhua.”

“In everyone’s eyes, tonight’s banquet was basically to clear the name of Feng Qianhua and Feng Qianxian.”

The banquet started at 10 o’clock.

“There were still five minutes before the banquet started, and the main and secondary seats were already full.”
