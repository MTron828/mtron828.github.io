Translator: 549690339

What a pity.

“Ye Sui did not notice Zhou Ziyue’s expression and said with a smile, “What do you mean it’s over! Ziyue, what are you saying?” ”

Zhou Ziyue was stunned and could not say a single word.

Regret.

She was very regretful now.

She regretted why she had to create trouble.

“She had thought that she had always been very smart, but she did not expect that from the beginning to the end, she was the clown. ”

“”Ziyue, what’s Wrong?”Ye Sui nudged Zhou Ziyue. ”

“Zhou Ziyue looked up at ye Sui, and at that moment, tears fell directly from her eyes. “It’s fake, it’s all fake! It’s all fake!” ”

“”What’s Wrong?”Ye Sui was still immersed in the beautiful dream that Ye Shu was going to be unlucky and that their family was going to be rich. He continued, “Everything Is Fake?” ”

“Zhou ziyue cried, “Mom, we have nothing! We shouldn’t have come to the capital in the first place!” ”

“If she hadn’t come to the capital, none of this would have happened, and she wouldn’t have broken up with Feng Yang. ”

She regretted it.

Zhou Ziyue really regretted it!

“What’s Wrong?”

“At this moment, there was a knock on the door. ”

“I’ll open the door first.”Ye Sui walked over to open the door.

The door opened and a staff member stood outside.

“Are they ye Sui and Ms. Zhou Ziyue?”The hotel staff member asked.

Ye Sui nodded. “Yes.”

“The staff member continued, “Please Pack your things and go to the front desk to go through the formalities. Leave the hotel.” ”

“”Leave the hotel? Why?”Ye Sui continued, “Is it ye Shu who came to pick us up?” ” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“The staff looked at ye Sui and said, “There are also ye Dafu and Ms. Yao Cuifen who are with us. Please leave our hotel as soon as possible.” ”

Ye Sui was still a little confused.

“Until the staff left, ye Sui still didn’t understand what had happened. ”

“”Ziyue, what’s going on!”Ye Sui continued, “Ye Shu didn’t come either. Why did the hotel suddenly stop letting us stay?” ”

“”Ziyue, say something!”Seeing that Zhou Ziyue didn’t say anything, ye Sui reached out and pushed her. ”

Only then did Zhou Ziyue react. “Let’s go back.”

“If this continued, they wouldn’t be able to stay in the capital city any longer. ”

They could only leave first.

“”Go Back?”Ye Sui widened his eyes speechlessly. “Damn girl, are you crazy!” ”

How could she go back in this situation?

“Zhou ziyue continued, “Don’t you understand what happened?” ”

Ye Sui narrowed his eyes and turned on his phone again.

“After ye Sui figured out what happened, he was dumbfounded. He looked at Zhou Ziyue and asked, “What, what’s going on?” ”

Why did the public suddenly attack them? !

“Zhou ziyue continued, “Now you understand why the hotel doesn’t let us stay here, right?” ”

“What about our Villa?”

“Hearing that, Zhou ziyue said speechlessly, “What time is it? You’re still thinking about the villa? !” ”

Ye Sui was unwilling.

He was very unwilling.

“”It’s all because of you, you wretched girl!”Ye Sui slapped Zhou Ziyue’s face. “I already said that I’m not leaving, but you insisted on leaving! Now Isn’t It Better!” ”

“When he left the Lin family, ye Sui had already felt that this matter was a little unreliable. It was Zhou Ziyue who insisted on moving away! ”

“Now, it was enough! ”

Ye Sui was really angry!

“Didn’t you have a way? Didn’t you have a way? Why aren’t you saying anything now?”Ye Sui was so angry that he was about to cry.

Zhou Ziyue’s face was ashen. “I didn’t expect things to turn out like this...”

She really didn’t expect it.

“”Mom, stop talking. Let’s leave quickly.”Zhou Ziyue knew how big the impact of this matter was. She continued, “And Grandpa and Grandma.” ”

“Since things had developed to this point, ye Sui wasn’t willing to leave just like that. “I’m not leaving! I’m Ye Shu’s sister. Why should I leave!” ”

Zhou ziyue frowned. “Haven’t you realized the seriousness of the situation?”

“You still have the nerve to say that!”Ye Sui got angrier the more he thought about it. He slapped Zhou Ziyue’s face again. “I think you’re sick! I must have lost my mind to believe your nonsense!”

The current ye Sui was very regretful.

“If she had not listened to Zhou Ziyue and moved out of the Lin family, she would still be living in the Lin family. ”

At least there was hope if she lived in the Lin Family!

But now!

“There was no hope, there was nothing! ”

“Go and apologize to me now! Go and apologize to ye Shu! Ask her to forgive you!”

Zhou Ziyue just sat on the ground with no life on her face.

She came to the capital.

She felt that her life was a joke.

A clown who had been played.

“”We shouldn’t have come from the beginning.”Zhou Ziyue looked up at ye Sui. “If we hadn’t come, so many things wouldn’t have happened.” ”

“Thinking back to everything that had happened in the capital, ye Sui felt very uncomfortable. ”

“First, he was fooled by Ma Lu, and then he broke up with Feng Yang... ”

Their ten-year relationship was all ruined by her hands.

Zhou Ziyue suddenly broke down and burst into tears.

Ye Sui looked at Zhou Ziyue and was so angry that he wanted to kill her with a knife!

“How could I give birth to such a useless thing like you!”

“At this moment, ye Sui seemed to have thought of something. He held Zhou Ziyue’s hand and said, “Get Up! Get Up quickly! You Go and contact Xiao Ma and ask him to think of a way!” ”

“The Lin family had power and influence in the capital, but the Ma family was not bad either! ”

“With Ma Lu around, this matter would definitely be resolved perfectly. ”

“Thinking of Ma Lu, ye Sui regretted the slap that he gave Zhou Ziyue just now. ”

“”It’s impossible for me to be with him,”Zhou Ziyue said in a daze. ”

“”Why?”Ye Sui widened his eyes, which were full of disbelief. ”

Zhou Ziyue’s eyes were full of self-mockery. “Do you really think that he likes me?”

Ma Lu was just playing with her.

“Thinking of this, Zhou Ziyue’s heart went cold, and she felt very uncomfortable. ”

“”What do you mean?”Ye Sui looked at Zhou Ziyue, his eyes full of disbelief. ”

“He was just playing with me! Did you take it seriously?”Zhou Ziyue laughed.

Ye Sui stared at Zhou Ziyue. “What did you say! Say It Again!”

Zhou Ziyue bit her lips.

Ye Sui was so angry that his face turned white. He grabbed Zhou Ziyue’s shoulder and shook it hard. “What’s wrong with you! What’s wrong with you!”

Zhou Ziyue was her only hope!

“But now, that hope was gone! ”

Zhou Ziyue’s face was devoid of any expression. She was like a marionette.

“At this moment, the door was pushed open from the outside. It was ye Dafu and Yao Cuifen. ”

“Xiao Sui! What are you doing? ! What happened between the mother and Daughter?”Yao Cuifen looked at the mother and daughter sitting on the ground. Her face was full of surprise.

Neither of them said anything.

“Yao cuifen continued, “Why is the hotel suddenly not letting us stay? is Little Shu coming to pick us up?” ”

“At this moment, Yao Cuifen was still immersed in the joy of being picked up by Ye Shu to enjoy her life. ”
