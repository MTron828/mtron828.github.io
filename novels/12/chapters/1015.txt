“Although the counselor did not know what kind of achievements ye Zao had in the medical world, the people who came to find ye Zao were all big shots in the medical world. It could be seen that ye Zao’s status in the medical world was not simple.”

“If he did not ask clearly, the counselor really did not dare to let Cao Wei and elder Zhang Meet Ye Zao.”

“Cao Wei immediately handed a business card to the counselor. “Counselor Jia, my surname is Cao! We are looking for miss ye for something very important to say. Please excuse us!””

“The counselor looked at Cao Wei’s business card and said in surprise, “Mr. Cao is from the Shunxi Financial Group! ?””

The Shunxi Financial Group was ranked second in China and ninth in the world.

“Although the counselor was from the chemistry department, he had heard about the Shunxi Financial Group from the professors in the finance department!”

Cao Wei nodded.

“The counselor continued, “Then please wait here for a while. I’ll go ask ye Zhuo if he’s willing to meet you!””

“”Okay, thank you!”Cao Wei continued, “Please tell Miss ye that we have something very important to tell her!””

The counselor nodded. “Alright.”

Ye Zhuo had a full class today.

It was time to end class.

“Suddenly, someone came to look for her. “God Ye, the counselor is looking for you!””

Ye Zhuo took off his wireless earpiece. “Counselor?”

“”Yes.”The student continued, “The counselor is waiting for you downstairs.””

Ye Zhuo came downstairs.

“When the counselor saw ye Zhuo, she immediately trotted over. “Student ye Zhuo.””

“Ye Zao smiled faintly. “Counselor, are you looking for me?””

The counselor handed Cao Wei’s business card to Ye Zao. “I’m not looking for you. This Mr. Cao and an old man are looking for you.”

Ye Zao took the business card and frowned slightly.

Cao Wei from Shunxi Financial Group.

Was she familiar with this person?

“A moment later, ye Zao looked up at the counselor. “Where are they now?””

“The counselor said, “They’re in my office.””

Ye Zao nodded. “Then I’ll go with you to take a look.”

“Okay.”

Ye Zao followed the counselor’s footsteps.

“About seven to eight minutes later, they arrived at the office.”

“Seeing ye Zao come over, Cao Wei immediately stood up from his chair. “Miss Ye!””

“Ye Zao nodded slightly. “I’m sorry, but who are you?””

“I’m Cao Wei.”Cao Wei then introduced elder Zhang next to him. “This is elder Zhang from Shunxi Financial Group.”

“Elder Zhang raised his head to look at ye Zao, his eyes flashing with astonishment.”

“If this person in front of him was really ye Langhua’s granddaughter, then Shunxi Financial Group could see Hope!”

“Although this girl looked like she was only 18 or 19 years old, her powerful aura could not be ignored.”

“Even if he, who had experienced many hardships, stood in front of her, he still felt inferior!”

“Elder Zhang quickly reacted. “Hello, Miss Ye.””

“Hello.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “May I ask why the two of you have come to look for me?”

“Cao Wei said, “We have come to look for you this time because we have something to discuss with you about your mother, Ye Shu.”” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“My Mother?”Ye Zao frowned without leaving a trace.

“”Yes.”Cao Wei continued, “But this is not a place to talk. Why don’t we find a quiet place to talk?””

“Sure.”Ye Zao reached out his hand and brushed the hair behind his ear. “Then let’s go to the coffee shop next to the school?”

“Okay.”

“Seeing that ye Zao was going to go out with Cao Wei and the others, the counselor was a little worried and said, “Student Ye Zao, why don’t I Go With You?””

“Ye Zhuo was their school’s and even their class’s favorite. If something really happened, he wouldn’t be able to bear the responsibility!”

“Ye Zhuo turned to look at the counselor and said, “You don’t have to worry. I’ll be fine.””

“The counselor continued, “Then let’s keep in touch.””

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

Ye Zhuo followed Cao Wei and elder Zhang to the coffee shop.

“After sitting down, Cao Wei went straight to the point. “Miss Ye, I’ll cut to the chase. I’m here to talk to you about the background of your mother, Ye Shu.””

“My Mother’s background?”Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly.

Could there be another reason behind ye Shu’s background?

“Cao Wei nodded and took out a document and handed it to Ye Zao. “Miss Ye, this is the information I found in Yun Jing. Please take a look.””

Ye Zhuo took the document and flipped through it with her eyes lowered.

“Although she read it very quickly, it did not affect the quality.”

It would be a lie to say that she was not shocked after reading all the contents of the document.

“Although ye Shu did not look like a member of the Ye family, she had never thought that ye Shu was not ye Dahai’s daughter.”
