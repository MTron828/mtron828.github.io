Cheering.

Even song Chenyu’s fans cheered along.

The scene went out of control for a while.

“Cen Yuyan turned to look at the big screen in disbelief, her face immediately turning pale. ”

She did not expect ye Zao to Really Pass!

“At this time, the black car was already far ahead, while the red car was still passing the consecutive hairpin turns. ”

“He ziteng was also extremely excited. Just a moment ago, he was still breaking out in cold sweat because of ye Zao’s accident. Unexpectedly, in the blink of an eye, Ye Zao had used his strength to prove himself. ”

Amazing!

He was really too amazing.

“In the Red Car, song Chenyu was even more in disbelief. ”

“She had never thought that one day, she would lose to a girl who was younger than her. Other than that face, there was nothing else that could compare to her. ”

No.

She could not lose.

She could not lose to ye Zao in front of Cen Shaoqing.

Song Chenyu sped up and tried to overtake ye Zao.

Unfortunately.

Ye Zao did not give her the chance to overtake at all.

“Thirty seconds later, the black car stopped at the finish line. The car door opened and a slender figure walked out. She wore simple white clothes and black pants. Her hair stood up high, revealing a fair and beautiful swan neck. ”

She walked slowly toward the audience seats.

“Her long legs were thin and straight. The hem of her white shirt was tied at her waist, giving off an unruly and bandit-like air. ”

She was so handsome that she wanted people to whistle.

“All the mockery, doubt, and disdain turned into affirmation and cheers at this moment. ”

A round of warm applause broke out in the spectator area.

“”God, you are so handsome!”He ziteng could not suppress the primal power in his body and ran over excitedly. ”

“If Cen Shaoqing had not been watching from behind, he would have even wanted to give ye Zao a hug. ”

“Just so-so.”

Cen Shaoqing stretched out his hand towards ye Zao. “It’s been hard on you.”

Ye Zao placed his hand on his. “It’s actually quite exciting.”Ye Zao really liked the adrenaline rush brought by racing cars.

The two of them walked to the viewing area together.

“Cen Yuyan’s expression was very ugly, but she still forced a smile. “Zao Zao, Congratulations.” ”

“Thank you.”

“After ye Zao sat down in the viewing area, the Red Car finally stopped at the finish line. ”

Song Chenyu did not even know how she got off the car.

She was very confused.

“She had always been very confident in herself because she had the ability to do so. Otherwise, she would not have gone from an ordinary 18th-tier to a publicly acknowledged goddess in the entertainment industry in just three years. ”

But today.

She had actually lost to ye Zao.

A 19-year-old little girl.

She had underestimated ye Zao.

Song Chenyu took a deep breath and tried her best to calm herself down.

“Since things had come to this, she could not act too coy. ”

She had to accept everything generously.

“I didn’t expect Miss Song to actually lose.”

“”I thought that other than song Chenyu, no one else in the car racing world could take first place.” ”

“This is called ‘the strong are stronger than the strong’!”

“”Am I the only one who feels that not only is Miss Ye’s driving skills better than song Chenyu’s, but she’s also prettier than song Chenyu?” ”

“Nonsense! We’re not blind!”

“...”

“Song Chenyu walked over step by step. Hearing the discussions of the crowd, her face turned slightly pale. She could only secretly rejoice that this was just an impromptu competition. ”

“If it was a formal competition, how could she raise her head in front of all the major media outlets? ”

Ye Zhuo was an internet celebrity.

She was a celebrity.

“All along, only internet celebrities lost to celebrities. When had a celebrity ever lost to an internet celebrity. ”

“When she saw song Chenyu walking over, Cen Yuyan immediately went up to him. “Chenyu, are you alright?” ”

Song Chenyu shook his head. “I’m fine.”

“CEN Yuyan continued, “Yuyan, don’t listen to these people’s nonsense! With your driving skills, how could you lose to Ye Zhuo? Are you feeling unwell somewhere?” ”

Cen Yuyan worshipped song Chenyu very much.

Song Chenyu was her idol.

She did not believe that song Chenyu would lose to Ye Zao.

There must be a reason behind this.

Definitely.

“After saying that, song Chenyu walked to Ye Zao’s side. “Miss Ye has really opened my eyes today!” ”

“Ye Zao smiled slightly. “Winning and losing are common occurrences in war. Miss Song, please don’t take it to heart.” ”

“”How can that be?”Song Chenyu smiled and said, “Being able to lose to such a powerful opponent like Miss Ye is also a form of training for me. Miss Ye, is it convenient for you to add me on wechat?” ”

“”I’m sorry,”Ye Zhuo rejected tactfully. “I didn’t bring my phone today.” ”

The smile on song Chenyu’s face did not diminish. “Then let’s do it another day.”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Cen Yuyan, who was at the side, was a little unhappy. ”

Didn’t bring a cell phone?
