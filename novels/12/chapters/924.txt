“Zhou Rui.”

“As expected, when she saw that Zhou Rui wanted to leave, CEN Yuyan immediately stood up as well. ”

Zhou Rui smiled and looked at Cen Yuyan. “Today is Sunday. You stay at home and accompany aunt and the others. I’ll go back first. You Don’t have to worry about me.”

“After saying that, Zhou Rui turned to look at Zhou Xiang and old Madam Cen. “Then, aunt and grandmother, I Won’t disturb you.” ” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Zhou Xiang nodded.

“Cen Yuyan looked at Zhou Xiang, her eyes filled with disappointment. She originally thought that Zhou Xiang would say something to make Zhou Rui stay, but Zhou Xiang didn’t even say anything to make him stay. ”

“Not only did Zhou Xiang not say anything, the Cen family’s older sisters and brother-in-law also didn’t say anything. ”

They were as cold as a group of strangers.

Zhou Rui turned around and left.

Cen Yuyan immediately followed Zhou Rui’s footsteps.

“”Yuyan, why did you come out?”Zhou Rui turned his head to look at Cen Yuyan. ”

“”I’ll go with you,”Cen Yuyan said. ”

“Zhou rui smiled and said, “Why are you going with me? Quickly go back. Auntie and the others were already very dissatisfied with me. If you go with me again, they will definitely have a deeper opinion of me.” ”

“Cen Yuyan sighed. “Zhou Rui, I’m sorry. I didn’t expect my mother and the others to be like this...” ”

“”It’s fine.”Zhou rui continued, “Actually, I already expected this outcome before I came with you. But I believe that one day, I will use my heart to move Auntie and the others.” ”

“At this moment, the Butler came out of the house. “Mr. Zhou, please wait a moment.” ”

“What’s Wrong?”Cen Yuyan turned around.

The Butler held the gift box that Zhou Rui had brought. “Old Madam asked me to return this to Mr. Zhou.”

Cen Yuyan was so angry that her entire body was trembling.

Zhou Rui held Cen Yuyan’s hand with one hand and took the gift box that the housekeeper handed over with the other.

“After returning the gift box to Zhou Rui, the housekeeper turned around and left. ”

“Cen Yuyan said in an angry tone, “My grandmother and the others have really gone too far!” ”

Sending goose feathers from a thousand miles away was a light gift with a heavy meaning.

“Zhou Rui had bought the gifts for them out of goodwill, but not only did they not appreciate it, they even returned the gifts. ”

Who was he slapping in the face?

He was slapping her in the face!

“After all, Zhou Rui was her boyfriend, their future son-in-law, their grandson-in-law! ”

“”Alright, don’t be angry,”Zhou Rui continued, “I was born into a humble family, but you are the Cen family’s eldest daughter. Perhaps in their eyes, I am not worthy of you at all. “Actually, this is also normal. Grandma and Auntie took you as their biological granddaughter and daughter, so they did not agree to this. This shows that they have taken a liking to you!” ”

Cen Yuyan didn’t expect Zhou Rui to still speak up for Old Madam Cen and Zhou Xiang.

“If it were anyone else, would they have the same magnanimity as Zhou Rui? ”

Such a good son-in-law was simply hard to find even with a lantern in hand.

“Yet, Old Madam Cen, Zhou Xiang, and the others didn’t know how to cherish it. ”

“After she finished speaking.., zhou Rui continued, “Yuyan, although they aren’t satisfied with me now, I believe that one day they will be satisfied with me. Alright, you should go back quickly. “Auntie and the rest must have a lot to say to you now. You are too impatient. Don’t argue with them on such matters. Calm down. No matter what, they are your family.” ”

“Yes.”Cen Yuyan nodded. “I know. Drive carefully on the road.”

“Okay.”Zhou Rui smiled. “I’ll call you when I get home.”

Cen Yuyan waved at him and watched Zhou Rui get into the car before she turned around and walked into the house.

“When she entered the house, Cen Yuyan looked at Zhou Xiang. “Mom, why did you treat Zhou Rui like that?” ”

“Zhou Xiang said, “That little boy doesn’t suit you.” ”

“Where doesn’t suit you?”Cen Yuyan asked in return.

“”Nowhere.”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Fourth Girl, you’re thirty-nine this year, not nine. Can’t you tell what that gigolo is thinking?” ”

“Cen Yuyan was about to faint from old Mrs. Cen’s words, but she still tried her best to calm herself down. “Grandma, Zhou Rui is not a gigolo! He’s my boyfriend! How can you say that about him!” ”

“”Not a gigolo, not a gigolo. Let me ask you, why does he like you?”Speaking up to this point, old Mrs. Cen raised her head to look at Cen Yuyan, “Does he like that you’re older than him? Or does he like that you have a brain like a fish? I beg you to grow some brains, okay?” ”

“”Grandma, this is an insult to Zhou Rui’s personality!”CEN Yuyan continued, “You don’t understand him at all. He’s not the kind of person who relies on women!” ”

“”If he doesn’t rely on women, will he be with you?”Old Mrs. Cen lowered her head to look at Cen Yuyan. “Cen Yuyan, if your name isn’t Cen Yuyan, if you’re not the Cen family’s fourth miss, do you think Zhou Rui will still bother with you?” ”
