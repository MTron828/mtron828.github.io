“Chapter 301: 103: The Wise Brother Ze, the Old Lady Cen, the King of tricks! 3”

“Are you worthy?”Lin Ze’s tone was cold and his eyes were full of sarcasm.

Feng Qianhua was stunned.

She had wanted to use this opportunity to influence Lin Ze.

She didn’t expect that Lin Ze would not be swayed by force or persuasion.

“She had already lowered her stance so much, but Lin ze still treated her harshly. ”

A bastard was a bastard!

He didn’t know how to appreciate favors!

He didn’t know how to judge the situation at all!

“Feng Qianhua thought about it and tried her best to make herself look more pitiful. She started to give Lin Ze some medicine, “Ah Ze, you don’t like me! I Don’t Blame You! However, what I said is true! You’re a good child. You should be able to understand these principles! If your mother is really a good mother, will she always ignore you?” ”

She absolutely could not allow them to recognize each other as mother and Son!

“This mother and son pair of hers had turned against each other, turning against each other! ”

“”If it’s useful to sow discord between us, I won’t be called Lin Ze anymore.”She might as well change her name to Lin silly. ”

After saying this.

Lin Ze turned around and left.

Feng Qianhua looked at Lin Ze’s back view and was so angry that her face turned pale.

B * Stard!

B * Stard!

Lin Ze was a B * Stard!

“Not long after Lin Ze left, Aunt Zhang walked out from the side. “How is it?” ”

Feng Qianhua tried hard to suppress the anger in her heart and shook her head. “This little bastard won’t listen to force or persuasion. It seems that we still have to think of other ways.”

She didn’t believe it.

She still couldn’t teach a nineteen-year-old kid a lesson!

“Aunt Zhang narrowed her eyes and a sinister look flashed across her eyes. “If I had known this would happen, I wouldn’t have let this little bastard live nineteen years ago!” ”

“Nineteen years ago, Lin Ze was still a baby in infancy. He had not been fed by his mother. Even if something had really happened, no one would have suspected anything. ”

But now.

Lin Ze was already nineteen years old!

“It’s no use talking about this now.”Feng Qianhua retracted her gaze.

“After saying that, Feng Qianhua continued, “I heard that your old cold legs were acting up again a few days ago. Are you feeling better now?” ”

Aunt Zhang nodded. “I’m much better now.”

Feng Qianhua sighed and reached out to hold Aunt Zhang’s hands. “It’s been hard on you all these years.”

“Aunt Zhang smiled and said, “No, it’s not hard at all.” ”

It had been so many years.

“Seeing that Feng Qianhua was about to see the light of day, she did not feel that it was hard at all. ”

Feng Qianhua took out a bank card from her pocket. “It’s not much. Please take it.”

“”I have enough money,”aunt Zhang refused. ”

“Feng Qianhua smiled and said, “You can keep this money for your retirement. Don’t take it out. Young people have hands and feet. They can earn it themselves! You have to plan for yourself. When you’re old, you should leave a way out for yourself.” ”

Aunt Zhang nodded. There were thousands of thoughts in her eyes before she accepted the bank card.

...

At the same time.

At the CEN Group.

“Li Qiandong rushed to the top-floor office excitedly. “Fifth brother! Fifth brother, have you seen the news?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing was holding a Buddhist bead in his hand. He was dressed in a plain, buttoned-up robe and was leaning against the back of his chair with his eyes closed to rest. ”

“He looked like a Buddha, but also like a celestial being. ”

His aura was transcendent.

“After a moment, he slowly opened his eyes. “What’s Wrong?” ”

His thin voice was covered in a layer of ice.

It was slightly cold.

“Li Qiandong held his phone and said excitedly, “Fifth brother! Yun Jing has produced a Godly Doctor Who can cure cancer! It’s even trending internationally now!” ”

Cure cancer?

Cen Shaoqing raised his eyebrows slightly. “Is there such a thing?”

Cancer was equivalent to death.

“Once One got cancer, it was like facing the death penalty. ”

“Although there were top experts in various countries around the world who had been researching cancer antibodies, after more than ten years of research, there was still no sign of it. ”

“Even technology, medical skills, and the most developed country, country P, were unable to cure cancer. ” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

There was such a talent in Yunjing?

“”It’s true! Now, the number one people’s Hospital in Yunjing is packed to the brim!”Li Qiandong was very excited, “I have to say, this miracle doctor ye is really too capable!”! Various countries all over the world sent experts over to discuss academic knowledge with Miracle Doctor Ye. Unfortunately, Miracle Doctor Ye did not have the time to pay attention to them! Not only did miracle doctor ye not show his face, but he also declined interviews from all the major media reporters! Now, the Internet has exploded!” ”

“Miracle Doctor Ye?”Cen Shaoqing’s hand that was holding the Buddha bead paused.

“That’s right! It’s Miracle Doctor Ye.”Li Qiandong nodded.

Cen Shaoqing narrowed his eyes.

He thought of someone.

Ye Zao.

Ye Zao’s medical skills were very good.

She was the one who cured old lady Cen’s illness.

Thinking of this person’s abilities.

Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads.

Could it be...

It really was her?

“”Fifth brother, what are you thinking about?” ”

“Ye Zhuo.”Cen Shaoqing did not hide it.

“Li Qiandong also thought of something at this time and said in surprise, “I remember that the old lady’s illness was cured by the great god, right?” ”
