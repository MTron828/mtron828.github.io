“Hearing the Vice President’s voice, Man Wen was stunned. ”

He felt like he was in a dream.

He originally thought that these people were here to support man Xing and man Zai Bang.

Who would have thought that there would be such a reversal.

“Not only did they not support man Xing and man Zai Bang, they were here to support him instead. ”

“For a moment, man Wen was unable to react. ”

“Seeing that he did not move for a long time, fan mu reached out and pushed Manwen. “Manwen! Go quickly! What are you waiting for!” ”

“Okay.”Only then did Manwen react and walk up to the stage.

“The vice president passed the Manxing country’s presidential seal to him. “Mr. Manwen, Congratulations.” ”

Manwen took the seal with both hands. “Thank you.”

“At the same time, the audience broke out into an earth-shattering applause. ”

“The manxing country’s election was absolutely fair and just. The fact that man Wen could win the support of Shi Qingcheng, Ye Han, Leo, Mr. Feng, and other big shots was enough to prove his strength. ”

“Man Xing looked at man Wen’s figure, and her eyes almost spat fire. ”

She had never expected that she would lose to man Wen.

What exactly did man Wen have?

“Although she was very angry, man Xing did not show it. ”

The etiquette she had received since she was young told her that she could not do anything embarrassing in public.

Hold it in.

She had to hold it in now.

It was never too late for a gentleman to take revenge!

“Therefore, if she looked at man Xing like this, she would not be able to tell anything. ”

“At this moment, master Cao suddenly spoke. ”

“Wait!”

“If man Xing could swallow this, he could not swallow it. ”

He had made a mistake.

“In master Cao’s opinion, Shi Qingcheng and the others must have made a mistake. ”

Man Xing was better than man Wen in every way. Why did he let man Wen take away what should belong to man Xing?

They should have come to support man Xing. It was just that they had voted wrongly.

“Man Xing was his disciple whom he had raised. Just like his own daughter, master Cao’s greatest wish was to see man Xing achieve great things. ”

“Now, Manwen had suddenly snatched the things that belonged to Manxing. How could master Cao Bear It? ”

“The vice president looked at Master Cao. “Master Cao, is there anything else?” ”

Master Cao stood up from his seat. “Everyone here has witnessed Miss Manxing’s abilities. May I ask what Mr. Manwen has achieved?”

“The moment he said this, the entire place fell silent. ”

“Leo stood up and continued, “Then may I ask master Cao to give an example of Miss Manxing’s achievements. Did she pacify the war, or did she have first-class military merits in the Military Academy?” ” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“This time, it was master Cao’s turn to be stunned. ”

Manxing was indeed very outstanding.

“However, Manxing did not have any of these achievements. ”

Manxing’s excellence lay in her usual excellence.

“However, master Cao was not flustered. He continued, “Although Miss Manxing did not have any outstanding achievements, she is extremely talented and well-versed in all kinds of military books. She is more qualified than the other three successors to the position of President.” ”

“Shi Qingcheng stood up and continued, “The position of president is the aspiration of the people. Manxing was my student previously. Her talent can not be denied. However, the position of president is an unconquerable mountain to her.” ”

The position of President was an unconquerable mountain to her?

Manxing was so angry that she was about to laugh!

“If she was unable to conquer the position of president, then what did manwen have? ”

Manwen could not even be compared to one of her little fingers!

“However, these words came from Shi Qingcheng’s mouth. ”

“Shi Qingcheng was her teacher. In this world, there was no one who understood her students better than a teacher. ”

What did man Wen Do to make Shi Qingcheng favor her so much.

To make Shi Qingcheng even say such a lie!

“Master Cao laughed and fought back, “If even Man Xing isn’t qualified, then what right does man Wen have? How many military books has man Wen Read? Officer Shi, you don’t Understand Man Wen at all. If the position of the President in man Xing is an unconquerable mountain, then to man Wen, it’s like a drop in the ocean.” ”

“Talking about war on paper is far from being as strong as actual connections. Mr. Manwen has the support of US people. We are Mr. Manwen’s capital.”Ye Han and Mr. Feng stood up from their chairs.

“”If they are not enough, there’s still us.”Shi Qingcheng, Leo, and the members of the JY team stood up as well. ”

“When man Xing saw this scene, he couldn’t help but feel angry in his heart. ”

Are these people crazy? !

They actually supported man Wen.

What the Hell was Man Wen.

“Man Xing’s hands were clenched into fists. Because he had used too much strength, his knuckles had already turned slightly white. ”

“The vice president looked at master Cao and continued, “Master Cao said that Miss Man Xing is extremely talented. Why isn’t there anyone who supports man Xing?” ”
