Translator: 549690339

Can an aircraft carrier be developed just like that?

“If an aircraft carrier was really that easy to develop, more than 200 countries around the world would not have waited until now! ”

Could it be that so many experts from all over the world added together were not even comparable to one ye Zao?

...

On the other side.

Shunxi Financial Group.

Si lui returned with the information he had found.

“Zhao Xueyin took the information and smiled, “Big Brother Si, thank you for your hard work.” ”

“”It’s my pleasure.”Si lui continued, “Ye Shu’s children are not simple people.” ”

“What do you mean?”Zhao Xueyin asked.

“Si Lui was silent for a moment, “You’ll know when you look at the information.” ”

“Zhao Xueyin opened the information. The more she read, the more serious her expression became. ”

“Just as the lawyer had said, even though ye Shu was just a country bumpkin, Lin Ze and ye Zhuo were both exceptionally talented. ”

“Not only did these two siblings get into Beijing University at the same time, they were also the top scorers in the college entrance examination! ”

It was not unusual for them to get into Beijing University.

But getting into the top scorer was different.

Zhao Xueyin was also the top scorer back then. She knew how difficult it was to get into the top scorer.

“Back then, she worked hard for a month without eating or sleeping. She did many sets of papers before she managed to get into the top scorer without any danger. ”

But these two siblings from the Lin family actually both got into the top scorer.

And their scores were so high.

749 points!

And this was a naked score.

What surprised Zhao Xueyin even more was that ye Zhuo was also a doctor YC in the science and technology world.

“When she saw this information, Zhao Xueyin could hardly believe her eyes. ”

She froze for a few seconds before she could believe it was real.

Ye Zao was the dark horse that shocked the entire science and Technology World last year!

One had to know that ye Zao was only nineteen years old this year.

Many people couldn’t reach ye Zao’s level even if they spent their entire lives.

“Zhao Xueyin was a very outstanding person. Ever since she was young, she had been the child of other people’s parents. No one had ever given her such a sense of crisis. ”

Especially ye Zao.

A 19-year-old doctor!

“Fortunately, Lin Ze was much more mediocre than ye Zao. ”

“If Lin Ze was the same as ye Zao, then Zhao Xueyin really didn’t know what to do! ”

“The lawyer saw the worry in Zhao Xueyin’s eyes and said, “Xueyin, you’re also a professor in the academic world. You’re just a doctor in the science and technology world. There’s no need to take it to heart.” ”

“Zhao Xueyin raised her head to look at the lawyer. “But ye Zao is only 20 years old this year. Moreover, Ye Zao became famous in the Science and Technology World last year!” ”

“Last year, Ye Zao was 19 years old. ”

“At 19 years old, he could conquer the science and technology world and make those big shots call him daddy willingly. ”

Such a person was too scary. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Zhao Xueyin was a very self-aware person. She was already 26 years old this year.

“When she was 19 years old, she was still a nobody in the academic world. ”

She spent a whole eight years to become a professor.

How could she compare to Ye Zhuo?

“Thinking of this, Zhao Xueyin furrowed her brows tightly. ”

“Si lui continued, “Xueyin, have you heard of Shang Zhongyong? Sometimes being famous at a young age is not a good thing.” ”

“What do you mean?”Zhao Xueyin raised her head to look at Si lui.

“The lawyer did not think that ye Zhuo had anything to be afraid of, “Ye Langhua is a good example. Back then, the nineteen-year-old ye Langhua could be said to be extremely glorious. She did not lose to the current ye Zhuo at all. It could be said that she was even more dazzling than the current ye Zhuo! But in the end? Who would have thought that the talented lady of the Golden Age, who was famous throughout the capital, would actually be destroyed by the hands of a man? “She became a joke in the capital!” ”

Ye Langhua was much more famous than ye Zao now.

Ye Zao was only a doctor in the science and technology field.

“Ye Langhua was a woman of Honor back then, but she also had her own achievements in other fields. ”

“Compared to ye Langhua, Ye Zao was not just a little bit inferior. ”

“Even someone as powerful as ye Langhua had to bow to the word ‘love’, not to mention ye Zao, who was not as talented as ye Langhua. ”

Zhao Xueyin was different from ye Zao.

Zhao Xueyin’s position today was all because she had climbed up step by step.

“Ye Zao was talented. The heavens would reward him with food. Even if he did not work hard, he could still obtain everything. ”

“After all, she had a good grandmother. ”

“Hearing this, Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes. “Big Brother Si, do you mean that ye Zao will also follow ye Langhua’s Path?” ”

“Si lui nodded. “That’s entirely possible! There’s an old saying in China that goes, ‘when the beam is not upright, the beam is crooked.’ye Langhua and Ye Shu’s mother and daughter’s love path is rather bumpy. When it comes to Ye Zhuo, it naturally won’t be any better.” ”

Ye Langhua had been deceived by Xi Muwen for more than 30 years.

Ye Shu and Lin Jincheng had also been bumpy for decades.

“If Lin Jincheng had not brought ye Shu back from Yun Jing, Ye Shu would still be a single mother of an unmarried daughter. ”

“The mother and daughter were in the same boat. They were both love-struck, so how good could ye Zhuo be? ”

“No matter how powerful ye Zhuo was, he would not be able to escape this calamity! ”

“To put it nicely, he was a love-struck person, but in reality, he was ignorant and stupid! ”

“If ye Langhua had a brain, she would not have been deceived like that by Xi Muwen! ”

“Therefore, in Si Lu’s opinion, ye Zhuo was not worthy of being Zhao Xueyin’s opponent. ”

“After saying that.., si lui continued, “There’s also a saying that goes, ‘when your talents run out, Ye Zhuo might end up worse than ye Langhua in the future!'”! “Although ye Zhuo is doing well now, who can guarantee that she will continue to do well? But you are different. All of your achievements have been earned through your own efforts!”! “Xueyin, you have to learn to face yourself squarely and have confidence in yourself.” ”

“Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes and felt that Si lui’s words made sense. Ye Langhua was such a powerful person, yet she fell from the altar in an instant. ”

Ye Zhuo was ye Langhua’s granddaughter. How could she escape her fate?

“”Oh right,”Si lui seemed to have thought of something and continued, “There’s something very strange.” ”

“”Big Brother Si, what do you think?” ”

“Si lui said, “Ye Zhuo didn’t have a good reputation before she was recognized by the Lin family. I heard that she couldn’t even recognize a few simple Chinese characters. I especially went to look it up. She only scored less than 30 points in the six subjects of the monthly high school examination. It wasn’t until she was in her third year of high school that she seemed to suddenly have an epiphany. It was as if she had changed into a different person.” ”

One had to admit that ye Zhuo had changed a lot!

It was puzzling!

Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes. “There’s such a Thing?”

“It’s absolutely true.”Si lui nodded and took out another piece of paper from his briefcase. “This is ye Zao’s previous results.”

“Zhao Xueyin took it and looked at it. Ye Zao’s results in all the subjects were indeed unbelievably low. If she had not seen it with her own eyes, who would believe that it was the same person? ”

But it just had to be the same person.

It seemed that there were still many stories hidden in ye Zhuo’s body.

“A moment later, Zhao Xueyin put down the report card and looked up at Si lui. “Is ye Langhua trying to raise her biological daughter to become Old Master Ye’s successor?” ”
