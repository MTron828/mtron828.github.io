Miss ye is the person Xiao Tao worships the most!

“However, such words could not be said directly in front of old Madam Cen. Xiao Tao smiled and said perfunctorily, “Then your granddaughter-in-law is really amazing!” ”

“Old Madam Cen saw the perfunctory look on Xiao Tao’s face and continued, “You’ll know in the future.” ”

...

“On the other side, Duanmu Feng and her eyes were red as they ran all the way back to the Duanmu family. ”

“Mrs. Duanmu was standing at the door. Seeing her like this, she immediately went up to her and asked with concern, “What happened? Did you hit a wall?” ”

Duanmu Feng didn’t say anything. She just hugged Mrs. Duanmu and cried bitterly.

She was really too sad and wronged!

“She had never been scolded by anyone in her entire life. Today, she was actually scolded by a lowly person from Earth! ”

“Most importantly, she could only endure and not resist! ”

“Did the old lady suffer because of you?”Mrs. Duanmu asked calmly.

“In her opinion, this was extremely normal. ”

“Today was the day that Duanmu Feng and the old lady met for the first time. The old lady was used to seeing that earthling, so she could not accept Duanmu Feng and the old lady for a moment. This was also human nature. ”

“What Old Lady? I think she is clearly an old devout woman! An old witch...”

“Duanmu Feng and old Madam Cen wanted to continue, but Mrs. Duanmu covered her mouth and continued, “Alright, Alright. The curse comes from the mouth.” ”

“”Mom!”Duanmu Feng and old madam CEN continued, “You don’t even know how that old devout woman insulted me today! I was kind enough to make her some snacks, but not only did she not appreciate my kindness, she even scolded me for dreaming of becoming a Phoenix! She said that I was a mistress! Who is the real mistress? !” ”

Duanmu Fengyu was so angry that tears streamed down her face. Only in front of her mother did she dare to cry so recklessly.

“Let’s talk inside.”Mrs. Duanmu pulled Duanmu Fengyu into the house.

“After entering the house, Mrs. Duanmu continued, “Fengyu, you are someone who wants to achieve great things! How Big of a deal is this? are your tears so worthless?” ”

Mrs. Duanmu didn’t expect that Duanmu Fengyu’s ability to withstand pressure was so small.

“”Mom, you weren’t there. You Can’t even empathize with what I’m going through!”Duanmu fengyu cried. “I’m not a mistress. Why should I be wronged like this!” ”

This made Duanmu fengyu think of a sentence. The master was wandering while the clown was in the hall.

Who Was Ye Zhuo?

What right did she have to stand by Cen Shaoqing’s side. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

She was the most qualified person to stand by Cen Shaoqing’s side and look down on the world with him.

“Mrs. Duanmu continued, “Mom knows that you’ve been wronged, but this is the path you must take. During this period of time, even if the old lady hits you and scolds you, you can only endure it, not to mention being wronged!”If one wanted to achieve great things.., in order to achieve great things, the first thing they learned was the word ‘endure’. ”

“”But how long do I have to endure?”Duanmu fengyu said aggrievedly, “That old witch has no humanity at all. She’s unreasonable!” ”

“”Fengyu, don’t tell me that with your ability, you can’t even subdue an old lady who came from Earth?”Mrs. Duanmu countered with a question. ”

Even ye Zhuo was able to win the old lady’s favor. Could it be that Duanmu Fengyu was inferior to Ye Zhuo?

“”Mom, do you know? That old lady is completely impervious!”Duanmu Feng said, “In front of her, no matter what I say or do, it’s all wrong! Moreover, her words are especially unpleasant!” ”

“Upon hearing this, Mrs. Duanmu narrowed her eyes. “She’s not the one who is impervious.” ”

“What do you mean?”Duanmu Feng asked.

“Mrs. Duanmu continued, “Feng You, you must remember that other than ye Zao being your enemy, everyone else is your ally. You must rope them all in! Do you know why the old lady used harsh words to heavily injure you?” ”

“I don’t know.”Duanmu fengyu shook her head.

“”It’s because of ye Zao.”Mrs. Duanmu analyzed, “Older people have soft ears. In addition, Dongli and ye Zao have known each other for a long time, so they have preconceived ideas. In the old lady’s eyes, Ye Zao is her granddaughter-in-law. So, no matter what ye Zao says, the old lady thinks that she’s right!” ”

A faint light flashed in Duanmu Fengyu’s eyes. “Are you saying that ye Zao spoke ill of me in front of the old devout woman?”

“”This is inevitable.”Mrs. Duanmu continued, “After all, you are now ye Zao’s only competitor. As long as she can make you quit, she will be in charge of the General Alliance in the future!” ”

“At this point, the corners of Mrs. Duanmu’s mouth curled up into a faint smile, “But ye Zhuo is still thinking too simply. Perhaps she can pass the Cen family’s test, but can she pass the state preceptor and the Great Elder’s Test? After so many years, when has it ever been the turn of an Earthling to make the decision in the General Alliance?” ”
