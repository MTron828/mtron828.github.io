“Chapter 841: 184: the all-powerful great burning, painting a tiger but not a dog”

Translator: 549690339

Dog Shit?

Trash?

“Old Mrs. Cen tried her best to calm herself down, “You can pick out a bone from an egg. If everyone is like you and looks at your work with a magnifying glass, then there is almost no flawless painting in this world.” ”

Ye Zao never felt that her painting skills were very good.

She was only painting to calm her heart and regulate her emotions.

Ye Zao could not stand still when he was suddenly praised by Old Mrs. Cen.

“He remembered that when he was in the other world, someone had once criticized her painting for being a dog instead of a tiger. ”

“From then on, she never said that she could paint anymore. ”

“After all, compared to the big boss, she was just a piece of trash. ”

“Ye Zhuo looked at Old Mrs. Cen and continued, “Grandma, are you kidding me?” ”

“In Old Mrs. Cen’s eyes, Ye Zhuo’s painting was simply a masterpiece. ”

It was the kind that could shock the Chinese art world.

“Yet, the person involved still looked indifferent and even threw the painting away as if it was trash. ”

This was simply a reckless waste of a god’s gift!

“”Who’s kidding you!”Old Mrs. Cen looked at ye Zhuo, “I’m very serious now! Very serious! Very serious! Ye, your painting is really very good!” ”

“Ye Zao thought that old Mrs. Cen was trying to cheer her up and said with a smile, “Of course, I’m so good-looking. How can my drawing not be good-looking?” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen was amused by Ye Zao and laughed out loud, “Yes, yes, yes! Our good-looking little girls are super good at drawing!” ”

“After saying that, old Mrs. Cen continued, “Right, Yezi, can you give me a drawing that you drew?” ”

“Sure.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and pointed at the painting on the table. “Do you think this one is okay?”

The painting on the table was clearly just finished.

The fragrance of ink and wash still lingered in the air.

“Old Mrs. Cen looked at the painting in front of her very seriously, and even took out her eyes from her pocket. ”

The whole painting could only be described with two words.

It was majestic.

The painting was arranged in a manner that was from far to near. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Two or three rows of white cranes flew in front of the mountain that was as tall as the clouds.

“There was a thatched cottage built at the foot of the mountain, and two plum trees were planted beside the thatched cottage. Heavy snow was drifting in the sky, and red plums were blooming in full bloom amidst the heavy snow, causing people to feel awe and respect. ”

“Looking further ahead, they saw two children building snowmen in the snow. ”

“Looking further ahead, she saw a natural lake. ”

There was a lone boat floating on the lake.

In front of the lone boat sat an old fisherman.

Even the expression of the old man was deeply drawn.

“In the entire painting, not to mention holding a magnifying glass, even if she held a microscope, she could not find a single flaw. ”

Old Mrs. Cen felt like she was dreaming and pinched her thigh hard.

It hurt.

She wasn’t dreaming!

“”Yezi, how much do you sell this painting for?” ”

“Sell?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly. “Can this painting be sold?”

“”Your painting is so good, of course it can be sold! “Not only can it be sold, it’s the kind that people are fighting for!”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Yezi, let me tell you, this painting of yours is simply a masterpiece. You Can’t just give it away! And you can’t just throw it away like trash!” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Alright, I won’t throw it away.” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen raised her head to look at Ye Zao. The more she looked, the deeper the smile on her face became. ”

Her granddaughter-in-law was really amazing!

“She knew how to fight, draw, finance, and program. She was simply the most amazing granddaughter-in-law in the universe. ”

“At this moment, there was another knock on the door. ”

“Come in.”Ye Zao looked up slightly.

“The next second, the door was pushed open from the outside. ”

“Ye Shu came in with a fruit plate. “Auntie Cen, have some fruit.” ”

“”Thank you, Ashu.” ”

“Ye Shu placed the fruit plate in front of old Madam Cen and said with a smile, “Why are you being so polite with me?” ”

Ye Shu placed the plate in front of the fruit and left.

“Old Madam Cen looked at Ye Zao. “Zao Zao, shall we play a game?” ”

“Sure.”

“Old Mrs. Cen liked to play pesticide very much, so she often teamed up with Ye Zao. ”

“Ye Zao took out his phone, opened pesticide, and clicked to invite Old Mrs. Cen. ”

“Not long after, the two of them entered the game page. ”

Ye Zao chose Yuan Ge.

“Old Mrs. Cen only knew how to play No. 7 Luban. Just as she was about to choose No. 7 Luban, she realized that her teammate had chosen No. 7 Luban. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen was not in a hurry. She immediately took out her trump card and started typing: [ I’m a primary school student. I only know how to play No. 7 Luban. I, Luban, am very good at it! If you don’t give me Luban, we will definitely lose! ] ”

“Seeing the text that old Mrs. Cen sent out, Ye Zhuo laughed lightly. “Grandma Cen, are you good at this?” ”
