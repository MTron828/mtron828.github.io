“Xia Xiaoman said, “This cousin of mine has always liked to compare herself to others since she was young. Now that she sees that I’m living so well, she must be feeling terrible! She’s feeling terrible from both sides. I Can’t be bothered to pretend anymore! Anyway, she didn’t come here to visit us sincerely.” ” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“As a cousin, Xia Xiaoman knew Zhou Cuihua too well. ”

“Lin Qingxuan hugged little lin zhi and said, “Wouldn’t it be a little bad if this news reached your relatives’ears?” ”

“No matter what, Zhou Cuihua was Xia Xiaoman’s relative. If this news reached Xia Xiaoman’s hometown, Xia Xiaoman would definitely be criticized. ”

“”She hasn’t returned to her hometown for many years. You Don’t have to worry about this.”Xia Xiaoman knew Zhou Cuihua too well, so she naturally knew Zhou Cuihua’s current situation. ”

“Lin Qingxuan nodded. “Alright, you can make the decisions on these matters.” ”

“Xia Xiaoman continued, “I didn’t ask him to stay tonight. I think she would be too embarrassed to come here in the future.” ”

“”Oh right, she also brought a bottle of wine over today.”Lin Qingxuan seemed to have thought of something and continued to say. ”

“What wine?”Xia Xiaoman asked.

“Lin Qingxuan continued, “I’ll bring it over for you to see.” ”

“A moment later, Lin Qingxuan brought the wine over. “I heard that it was produced in the 1980s and has been in storage for a long time. See how this wine is handled.” ”

“A bottle of wine that was worth more than 100,000 yuan was nothing to Lin Qingxuan, but to Zhou cuihua, it was a considerable income. ”

“Xia Xiaoman took the wine and said with a smile, “This cousin of mine really put in a lot of money this time.” ”

“After saying that, Xia Xiaoman continued, “Get someone to send this wine back.” ”

“”Isn’t this a little bad?”Lin Qingxuan said, “No matter what, this is still a gesture from her.” ”

“Xia Xiaoman thought for a while and said, “How about this, I’ll bring something over while I’m at it. Just say thank you for her kindness, but no one in our family drinks.” ”

“That works too.”Lin Qingxuan nodded.

Xia Xiaoman then arranged for the butler to return the wine to Zhou Cuihua.

On the other side.

On the road.

“Zhou cuihua was driving while chatting with Li Hang. “Hang, does an Lizi’s stepfather have any other children?” ”

“”I’m not too sure about that either,”li hang continued, “But at his age, he shouldn’t have no children at all.” ”

“Zhou cuihua nodded, “I think so too.” ”

The mother and daughter both had their own thoughts and soon reached home.

“Just like yesterday’s Li Hang, they returned to the apartment building again. No matter how Zhou Cuihua looked at it, she didn’t like it. ”

What right did Xia Xiaoman have to live in a big villa while she had to live in such a small shabby house?

She was unwilling to accept it.

“Mom went in.”Li Hang pulled Zhou Cuihua’s arm and the mother and daughter walked into the apartment building together.

“Not long after the two of them returned home, the urgent sound of a doorbell rang in the air. ”

“Ding Dong, Ding Dong — ”

Li hang immediately ran over to open the door. “You’re here.”

“The moment the door opened, Li Hang was stunned. “T-butler Grandpa.” ”

“That’s right, the person who came was the butler of the Lin family. ”

“The Butler gave a formal smile. “Hello, Miss Li. May I know if your mother is at home?” ”

“”Yes, she is.”Li hang nodded and took a few steps back. “Please come in.” ”

“Li hang shouted into the house, “Mom, come out.” ”

Zhou Cuihua walked out of the house. “What’s Wrong?”

“When she saw the butler, Zhou Cuihua immediately smiled. “Butler Wu, why are you here?” ”

“”My wife asked me to come.”The Butler placed the things in his hands on the ground, then she said, “And these things are what my wife asked me to bring to you. She said thank you for taking the time to visit her today and for bringing so many expensive gifts, but no one at home drinks.” ”
