“Bright Red Strawberries, big juicy peaches, sweet lychees, plump and juicy red bayberries... ”

“Zhou Xiang reached out and brought the lychees and the Garbo fruit to ye Zao. “Zao Zao likes lychees and Garbo fruits the most. Today’s Garbo fruit is especially sweet. Zao Zao, try it.” ”

“”Thank you, Auntie.”Ye Zao picked up a fruit and took a bite. The Juice was overflowing, and it was indeed very sweet. ”

“Zhou xiang smiled and said, “You Child, why can’t you change your bad habit of being polite! Shaoqing!” ”

“”Yes,”Cen Shaoqing answered. ”

“Zhou Xiang said, “What are you waiting for? Peel the lychee for Zao Zao.” ”

“I can do it myself.”Ye Zao picked up a lychee.

Zhou Xiang immediately took the lychee from ye Zhuo’s hand. “The shell of the lychee is particularly harmful to the nails. Just let Shaoqing do it. His skin is rough and his flesh is thick. He’s suitable for this kind of work.”

“Mom is right.”Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips opened slightly.

Xie Wanqiu was feeling a little uncomfortable.

Let Cen Shaoqing Peel the lychee for Ye Zhuo?

Zhou Xiang was the one who thought of it.

She was still sitting here as a grandmother. Did Zhou Xiang not know to let Cen Shaoqing Peel the lychee for her?

Did he want her to do it herself?

Zheng Wanyin was also here.

Zheng Wanyin was also a girl and Cen Shaoqing’s cousin.

Zhou Xiang didn’t know how to feel sorry for Zheng Wanyin?

Asking Cen Shaoqing to Peel Lychees for Zheng Wanyin?

Wasn’t it normal for this cousin to care for his cousin?

Zhou Xiang clearly didn’t put her and Zheng Wanyin in his eyes.

Xie wanqiu held her breath in her heart.

She felt a little uncomfortable.

Zheng Wanyin was even more surprised when she saw that Cen Shaoqing really started peeling lychees for ye Zao.

She was a little confused.

Was it because Cen Shaoqing really liked ye Zao.

Or was it because Zhou Xiang and old Mrs. Cen really liked ye Zao.

“After all, Cen Shaoqing only started peeling lychees for ye Zao after listening to Zhou Xiang’s words. ”

“After chatting for a while, Zhou Xiang said, “I’ll go to the kitchen to take a look.” ”

“”Second aunt, let me help you.”Zheng Wanyin stood up from the sofa. ” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Zhou Xiang said, “The kitchen is very oily. Don’t follow me.” ”

“It’s okay. I’m not that delicate.”Zheng Wanyin smiled and followed Zhou Xiang’s footsteps.

“The two of them came to the kitchen. Zhou Xiang instructed the chef, “Zao Zao came over today. Remember to heat up some of the dishes a little more. By the way, has that Stinky Mandarin fish been delivered?” ”

“The chef said, “It’s already been sent over.” ”

“”Remember to cook it,”Zhou Xiang continued, “The last time searing came over, the Smelly Mandarin fish at home were all eaten. This time, we must let searing eat it.” ”

The smelly mandarin fish of the Cen family were all sent over from the Cen Old Lady’s cousin’s house.

“The Cen Old Lady’s cousin had married into Huizhou, where the smelly mandarin fish was abundant. ”

The smelly mandarin fish they bought outside were not authentic from Huizhou.

The head chef nodded. “Okay.”

“Does cousin-in-law like to eat smelly mandarin fish?”Zheng Wanyin asked curiously.

“Zhou Xiang said, “She likes to eat smelly tofu very much. She hasn’t eaten smelly mandarin fish before. However, people who like to eat smelly tofu should also like to eat smelly mandarin fish, right?” ”

Like to eat stinky tofu?

Zheng Wanyin raised her eyebrows.

“Last night, she had heard Zhou Xiang say that ye Zao liked to eat desserts. ”

“Today, it had become that he liked to eat spicy food and stinky food! ”

What exactly did ye Zao Like to eat?

“Although she had some doubts in her heart, Zheng Wanyin did not show it. She continued, “By the way, second aunt, how did cousin and cousin-in-law meet? Did they fall in love freely, or were they introduced by someone else?” ”

There was a very famous ‘socialite training class’that came out of the training class. It was either marrying a best actor in the entertainment industry or marrying a bachelor.

Zheng Wanyin was a little suspicious. Ye Zhuo also came out of the training class.

“Otherwise, why would the character design be so strange? ”

“Zhou Xiang said, “It can be considered as being introduced by someone else. It can also be considered a free relationship. The process is very complicated, and it’s a little hard to explain.” ”

“Then what happened?”Zheng Wanyin asked.

“When she saw how curious Zheng Wanyin was.., zhou Xiang explained, “Actually, Shaoqing’s grandmother was the first to know Zhuluo. His grandmother was very satisfied with Zhuluo. Unfortunately, Shaoqing was still unmarried at that time. Then, one day, Shaoqing suddenly said that he had a girlfriend, and then he brought Zhuluo back. In fact, it was his grandmother who set him up!” ”

“If not for Old Lady Cen’s goading, Cen Shaoqing would still be lying to himself! ”

Zheng Wanyin nodded.

So it was Old Lady Cen’s matchmaking. No Wonder Old Lady Cen liked ye Zhonghua so much.

Zheng Wanyin finally found the reason.

“Soon, the two returned to the living room. ”

“Coincidentally, Cen Yuying, Cen Yueya, and Cen Yueying also returned at this time. ”
