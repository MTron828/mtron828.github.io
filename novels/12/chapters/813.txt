“However, she suddenly received a call from Xi Muwen. ”

“On the phone, Xi Muwen said that he had something urgent to ask her to go back. ”

Xi Weiyue could only go back first.

Back at the Xi family home.

“Xi Muwen and Yang Jiao were sitting on the sofa in the living room, waiting for Xi Weiyue to go back. ”

“”Father, why are you in such a hurry to call me back? What’s the urgent matter?” ”

“Xi Muwen stood up and said, “I heard from you last time that you wanted to join the Shunxi Financial Group. How is it going?” ”

“Xi Weiyue was a little speechless and said, “Father, do you think that the Shunxi Financial Group is some small company? Anyone can enter as they please! The old woman didn’t give me permission to enter the Shunxi Financial Group. Father, do you think that old woman really has a relationship with the Shunxi Financial Group?” ”

The Shunxi Financial Group was the second largest financial group in the financial world.

Joining the Shunxi Financial Group was even harder than ascending to the heavens.

Xi Muwen took a puff of his cigar and sank into his memories.

“When he married into the Ye family back then, the old man in the Ye family guarded against him like he was guarding against thieves. He didn’t allow him to come into contact with anything related to the ye group. ”

“Later on, if it wasn’t for the fact that grandfather Ye was suddenly lost for half a month and was unable to recover from his illness, he would still be a dog raised by the Ye family until now! ” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Every time he thought of this, Xi Muwen couldn’t tolerate it. ”

This was a stain on his life!

“Fortunately, things developed more smoothly after that. ”

“Regarding the Shunxi Financial Group, he saw two mysterious people come to look for grandfather ye when grandfather Ye was still alive. At that time, Xi Muwen had already sensed that something was wrong, and there was a door between them, he heard the words “Shunxi Financial Group”. ”

“Therefore, he had always felt that the ye family was related to the Shunxi Financial Group, even though ye Langhua had never admitted it. ”

“Xi Muwen exhaled a puff of smoke and continued, “I dare to guarantee that ye Langhua is definitely related to the Shunxi Financial Group. I just don’t know how long she will keep her mouth shut.” ”

It had been more than thirty years.

Xi Muwen had been waiting for ye Langhua’s answer.

“However, ye Langhua had always denied it. ”

There was still that secret.

“He had searched the entire ye family, but he still could not find that treasure map. ”

“The Ye family’s ancestors were local wealthy merchants. After the war, the Ye family’s great grandfather had buried the gold, silver, and jewelry that had been passed down from generation to generation. ”

This was what ye Langhua had told him personally when he and ye Langhua were dating.

“Therefore, this matter could not be faked. ”

“When ye Langhua was dating him, she trusted him very much and had told him almost everything. Xi Muwen now regretted not getting more useful information from ye Langhua back then. ”

“However, it was useless to regret now. ”

“When he thought of this, Xi Muwen narrowed his eyes. ”

“Yang Jiao sighed. “If she doesn’t say anything, then wouldn’t our efforts be in vain?” ”

“Ever since ye Langhua had gone missing for half a month, her health had not been good. ”

What if she died one day?

Xi Muwen frowned. “Don’t say such disheartening words.”

“”Is this disheartening? I’m telling the truth!”Yang Jiao continued, “Oh right, you haven’t been to Yun Jing for many years. How is that Little Bastard Now? Don’t come back one day!” ”

Xi Muwen’s eyes were filled with disgust when he heard that.

The little bastard that Yang Jiao mentioned was Xi Muwen and ye Langhua’s biological flesh and blood.

Half a month.

“Back then, the loss of half a month was not an accident. ”

All of this was XI Muwen’s plan.

“Xi Muwen was a person with high self-esteem. Because he was labeled as a son-in-law, he had been looked down upon by countless people outside. He had even been called a sugar daddy. ”

No one could see his hard work!

“Therefore, Xi Muwen decided to do something about it. ”

“After little half a month was born, the Ye family’s old patriarch and ye Langhua treated her as the apple of their eye. They held her in their mouths and held her in their hands for fear that she would fall. ”

“At this moment, Xi Muwen knew that his chance had come. ”

As long as something happened to little half a month.

The father and daughter of the Ye family would definitely not be able to withstand the blow.

The facts proved that.

He was right.

“After half a month went missing, the father and daughter of the Ye family died and went crazy. ”

“In less than half a year, Xi Muwen had turned the ye group into the XI group, and from then on, they were labeled as ‘living off women’. ”

“After sending half a month away, Xi Muwen specifically told that family that they could not send half a month to school. They only needed to give half a month food and not starve to death. ”

“Furthermore, the family had a daughter who was about the same age as Xiao Banyue, but she died of an acute illness. ”

Xi Muwen gave them a sum of money and had them secretly bury the dead child. He had Xiao Banyue replace the dead child.
