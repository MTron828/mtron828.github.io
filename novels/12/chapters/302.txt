Zhou Xiang:”! ! !”

“”Ah No!”Old Lady Cen immediately corrected her. “You’re wrong. Don’t worry, I’m not a bad person!””

“Zhou Xiang:”...”Hur Hur, she almost believed it.”

“After saying that, old lady cen continued, “Will that brat be back for dinner tonight?””

“He should be.”Zhou Xiang nodded.

“Old Mrs. Cen Winked at Zhou Xiang. “Xiang Xiang, just wait and see.””

Zhou Xiang knew.

Her mother-in-law was going to trick her family’s silly son again.

At night.

Cen Shaoqing came back on time for dinner.

“Halfway through dinner, Old Mrs. Cen suddenly put down her chopsticks. “Xiang Xiang, have you contacted Ze Yan recently?”” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“”No, why?”Zhou Xiang was confused.”

“Before she could react, her mother-in-law had already started to trick her silly son.”

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Didn’t you tell me this morning that you wanted to go to a private island to play? I was thinking of getting Yezi to go with us. You said that the three of us girls would definitely not be safe on the island! At this time, we need a boy to protect us! “I think Ze Yan is not bad. We can use this opportunity to set him up with Yezi! “Don’t you think this is a good thing that kills two birds with one stone?””

“When he heard the words ‘three girls’, the vegetable leaves in Cen Shaoqing’s mouth almost spurted out.”

His grandmother often said shocking things.

“However, when he heard Zhou Ze Yan’s name, Cen Shaoqing’s face instantly darkened.”

Why was he everywhere!

“”Grandma, Zeyan has to go to work tomorrow. He doesn’t have time to go to the island with you guys for a vacation.”Cen Shaoqing slightly raised his eyes.”

“Old Mrs. Cen chuckled and said, “I didn’t say it was tomorrow. How Do You Know It’s Tomorrow? Even if you have to go to work, you can still ask for leave! Work is never finished. Talking about a wife is a major event in life. Do you think everyone is like you? All day long, Amitabha, Amitabha! What do you mean, no wife, no marriage! Ren Zeyan wants to start a family! The leaf is so outstanding, if Ze Yan doesn’t make a move again, how to do by other Big Pig Trotters snatched away?””

“What the Cen Old Lady said is very reasonable, even Zhou Xiang listens to a Leng Leng Leng Leng Leng.”

“Cen Shaoqing put down his chopsticks, “Ze Yan is still in the internship period, unjustified leave, it will affect the graduation results.””

“Aren’t you cousin Zeyan? Can’t you be flexible about cousin Zeyan’s life-long affairs?”Old Mrs. Cen was speechless.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Even though I’m his cousin, I still have to do my job! Otherwise, what will the people below think?””

“Old Mrs. Cen was unhappy. “I don’t care! We have to let Zeyan go. If Zeyan doesn’t go, who will be in charge of our safety?””

Cen Shaoqing thought about it seriously. “Why don’t I Go?”

He thought about it.

He was still the most suitable person to go.

It wasn’t about love.

“He just felt that after working for so long, it was time for him to go out and adjust his mood.”

“Hearing this, Zhou Xiang’s eyes lit up.”

She really didn’t expect Cen Shaoqing to agree.

“Sure enough, love made one sink into oblivion.”

Cen Shaoqing clearly had his heart set on Ye.

“However, he was completely unaware of it.”

No wonder Old Lady Cen always thought of all sorts of ways to trick him.

Old Lady Cen looked at Cen Shaoqing with disdain. “Aren’t you an unmarried man? Why are you following me? Are you delaying Yezi’s youth?”

Cen Shaoqing:”...”his own grandmother?

“A while ago, Old Lady Cen was still trying her best to set him up with Ye Zao.”

She did not expect that her attitude would change so quickly.

No wonder they said that women were like needles at the bottom of the ocean!

Cen Shaoqing continued to count the Buddhist beads. “Whether or not I am a celibate or not is not in conflict with protecting your safety.”

Old Mrs. Cen glanced at him. “I have an appointment with Yezi. We will leave on Wednesday afternoon. Do you have time?”

“I’m not busy during this period of time.”Cen Shaoqing’s tone was indifferent.

Not Busy?

“When the CEN group’s higher-ups heard this, they silently cried and fainted in the toilet.”

“Then that’s it! Sigh!”Old Mrs. Cen sighed. “It’s such a pity! I originally wanted to Matchmake Yezi and Ze Yan. The heavens don’t make it good.”

Zhou Xiang secretly praised Old Mrs. Cen’s acting skills.

“Cen Shaoqing replied indifferently, “Maybe it’s because they’re not fated. Grandma, don’t randomly pick a couple.””

“”Don’t you know that there’s a saying, ‘love grows with time’?”Old Madam Cen said speechlessly, “It’s a sand sculpture! You won’t understand even if I tell you! It’s nothing!””

Cen Shaoqing:”...”

He suspected that he was not his biological grandson.

Zhou Zeyan was.

Zhou Xiang covered her mouth and snickered.
