Chapter 669: 153: Feng Qianxian committed suicide and made a wedding dress for someone else! 1

Translator: 549690339

Old Mrs. Lin had just undergone a full-body check-up.

“The doctor told her that her body had been severely corroded by the poison and there was too much residual poison. In the following days, she could only rely on drinking Chinese medicine to detoxify her body. It would be best if she could detoxify the poison, but if she could not.., then her life could be threatened at any time.”

This was all caused by Feng Qianhua!

“If it wasn’t for Feng Qianhua, she wouldn’t have become like this!”

It was all Feng Qianhua!

“When she saw Feng Qianxian, Old Lady Lin was even more furious.”

She treated Feng Qianxian like her own granddaughter.

“She even forced ye Zhuo to break up with Cen Shaoqing for her, but what about Feng Qianxian?”

How did Feng Qianxian treat her?

Feng Qianqian had actually drugged her together with Feng Qianhua.

“Seeing that Old Lady Lin did not speak for a long time, Feng Qianqian asked curiously, “Grandma, Why aren’t you saying anything? Did Something Happen?””

“It was also at this moment that Old Lady Lin reacted. Looking at Feng Qianqian’s face, she was almost unable to contain her anger. She gave Feng Qianqian a slap on the back, “Who’s your grandma? Who are you calling Grandma? You Heartless Little Bitch! Ingrate! Get lost! Get lost!””

Everything happened too quickly. Feng Qianqian did not even have time to react.

A red palm print appeared on her left cheek instantly. Her face was burning with pain and her ears were buzzing.

Hit Her?

Old Mrs. Lin actually hit her!

Why would old Mrs. Lin hit her?

Feng Qianhua had been arrested by the police.

And now Old Lady Lin was treating her like this.

Could it be that this matter had something to do with it?

Or was Feng Qianhua’s actions exposed?

“Thinking of this, Feng Xianxian’s eyes twitched.”

It wouldn’t happen.

It wouldn’t happen!

“Feng Qianhua had always been very cautious. Besides, some things had already been going on for nineteen years. How could Old Lady Lin find out?”

There must be a mistake!

“Feng Qianqian covered her face and tried to calm herself down. She looked at Old Lady Lin and tears rolled down her cheeks. “Grandma, what did I do wrong? Are you going to treat me like this?””

“Old Lady Lin glared at Feng Qianqian fiercely. “Shut up, you little slut! Who’s your grandma!””

Little Slut?

“Not only did Old Lady Lin hit her, she even called her a little slut.”

Feng Xianxian had grown up in Old Lady Lin’s hands since she was young. When had Old Lady Lin ever hit and scolded her like that?

Could it be that Feng Qianhua’s deeds had really been exposed?

“”Grandma, what happened to you? Why did you suddenly become like this? When I found out that you were sick and hospitalized, I didn’t even attend class and ran over to see you... “...”. “Why did you do this to me?”Feng Xianxian said with a grievance, “Grandma, I have always thought that you are a kind, fair and just person! “What exactly happened? Can you please tell me?””

“Looking at the child who grew up by her side, Old Mrs. Lin couldn’t put on any expression.”

“Before ye Zao was found, the Lin family had only given birth to sons and no daughters.”

“Therefore, after Feng Qianhua gave birth to Feng Xianxian, Old Mrs. Lin was very happy and treated Feng Xianxian more closely than her own grandson.”

Feng Xianxian was always a part of the things that she prepared for Lin Ze.

“From babbling to learning to walk, and now to becoming a slim little girl, Old Mrs. Lin had always been involved in Feng Xianxian’s growth.”

She never thought that one day she would stand against Feng Xianxian!

This blow was also very big for Old Mrs. Lin.

She regretted not recognizing people clearly.

“If she had known the true colors of Feng Qianhua and her mother, things would definitely not have developed to this state.”

“Old Mrs. Lin looked at Feng Xianxian and said, “You can go. Don’t come looking for me again! I don’t want to See You Again!””

“”Grandma!”Feng Xianxian immediately knelt down to old Mrs. Lin. “Please tell me what happened, okay? I beg you!””

“Go and ask your mother what she did!”Old Lady Lin turned her head.

“”Grandma!”Feng Xianxian said in a hoarse voice, “Although you slapped me, I Don’t blame you. I know that something must have happened! I don’t beg you to forgive me, I Only Beg You to tell me the truth!””

Old Lady Lin looked up at the bodyguard outside the door. “Get her out of Here!”

“”Yes, Old Lady.””

Feng Xianxian was dragged out of the door by the bodyguard.

“Feng Xianxian sat on the ground, her eyes dark.”

No Way!

She couldn’t admit defeat so easily.

“She had to pull herself together, clarify the matter, and then beg Old Lady Lin to forgive her.”𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m
