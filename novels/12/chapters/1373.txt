Even ye Zhuo could be together with Cen Shaoqing.

Why couldn’t she?

How could she not be comparable to Ye Zhuo?

Could it be that it was this face.

“Zheng Wanyin reached out to caress her own face, and then.., her eyes reddened as she said, “Grandfather, it’s not sweet to force things. Furthermore, cousin is so outstanding, and I look so ordinary. I’m not even a passer-by. “I’m not worthy of Cousin at all. Please don’t force second aunt. Don’t make things difficult for cousin. It’ll make everyone unhappy.” ”

“Zhou Xiang was not a scheming person. subconsciously, he felt that Zheng Wanyin was right. “Wanyin is right. Dad, please don’t interfere in this matter! I’m begging you!” ”

Zhou Xiang actually felt that Zheng Wanyin was right?

Did she mean that Zheng Wanyin was not worthy of Cen Shaoqing?

“In Zhou Zuolong’s heart, Zheng Wanyin was his most outstanding granddaughter. In this world, there was no one who could compare to Zheng Wanyin! ”

But Zhou Xiang was actually not worthy of Cen Shaoqing.

“Xie wanqiu, who was beside him, was also very angry. ”

“If she was not his biological daughter, then she was not his biological daughter. ”

“If Zhou Xiang was Zheng Wanyin’s biological second aunt today, how could Zhou Xiang say such words? ”

Ingrate!

“”Vile daughter, let me ask you, how is it that Yinyin isn’t good enough for Shaoqing!”If she wasn’t good enough, it should be that Cen Shaoqing wasn’t good enough for Zheng Wanyin, but it wasn’t Cen Shaoqing’s turn to say that she wasn’t good enough. ”

“”Face, can face be used as food?” ”

“Although Zhou Zuolong had never seen ye Zao, he had heard of ye Zao and knew that Ye Zao was good-looking. ”

But what was the use of being good-looking?

Zheng Wanyin had inner beauty.

Did Ye Zao Have It?

Ye Zao was just a socialite who played the role of Xi Xi.

“Zhou xiang continued, “Dad, it’s not a matter of whether you’re worthy or not, but Shaoqing doesn’t have that kind of intention towards Wanyin at all. The person he loves is Zao Zao!” ”

“”Bai Tang forced ye Zao onto Shaoqing! If it wasn’t for Bai Tang’s unnecessary actions, Shaoqing and yinyin might have already gotten married!” ”

Why didn’t Cen Shaoqing fall in love after so many years?

Perhaps it was because he was waiting for Zheng Wanyin!

“After all, Zheng Wanyin, Little Cen Shaoqing, was quite a few years old. ”

“The more Zhou Zuolong thought about it, the more he felt that this was the case. He continued, “Zhou Xiang, listen well. I only acknowledge yinyin as my granddaughter-in-law! I Won’t acknowledge anyone else!” ”

Cen Shaoqing wanted to be together with ye Zao unless he died!

“Otherwise, ye Zao would never be able to enter the Cen family. ”

“He was Cen Shaoqing’s grandfather. He did not have any other power, but he still had such little power! ”

“”Dad, CAN’T I just take it as I’m begging you?”At this moment, Zhou Xiang was very desperate. ”

She thought of Wu Lan again. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“If Wu Lan had not betrayed Zhou Zuolong, she definitely would not be in this situation right now. ”

“All these years, Zhou Zuolong had vented all his resentment towards Wu Lan on her head. ”

“After all, it was Wu Lan who had betrayed Zhou Zuolong. ”

“Therefore, all these years, Zhou Xiang had no regrets about what Zhou Zuolong had done. ”

“Now, Zhou Zuolong only wanted to slap Zhou Xiang awake. ”

How could he have such a stupid daughter?

She was simply as stupid as a pig.

“Some people could see through it easily, but Zhou Xiang was indifferent no matter what others said. It was as if she was living in her own world. ”

Self-deception.

“Xie wanqiu took a step forward and walked to Zhou Xiang’s side. She half-squatted down, she said earnestly, “Xiangxiang, listen to your father! Your father is also doing this for your own good. Think carefully. How many parents in this world would harm their children? I Won’t, and your father won’t!” ”

“At this point, Xie wanqiu paused and sighed, “Although I’m not your biological mother, I still hope that you can live a good life more than anyone else! “Your father and I are almost 200 years old together. We’ve crossed more bridges than you have. It’s said that the onlooker sees clearly, but the person in the middle is confused. You’re the person in the middle now. So, just listen to your father! We Won’t harm you. One day, you’ll understand that everything we’ve done is for your own good!” ”

“”Mom!”Zhou Xiang looked up at Xie wanqiu. “If you really want my good, please don’t interfere in the matter between Shaoqing and Zhuozhu!” ”

“Xiang Xiang!”Xie Wanqiu’s eyes were full of resentment.

“Zhou Xiang grabbed Xie Wanqiu’s hand. “Mom, please advise Dad! He always listens to you the most. Please let him fulfill Shaoqing’s wishes!” ”

“No matter what, Zhou Zuolong was her father. ”

Zhou Xiang did not want to see the father and daughter falling out.
