Translator: 549690339

Man Xing had never admired anyone in his life.

Miss Ye was the first.

Miss ye was famous in Changyue alone. Man Xing had thought that Miss Ye was born into a big family and was a noble daughter raised by a noble family. He did not expect that Miss Ye had been a wandering orphan since she was young.

“When he learned that Miss Ye was the eldest sister who had been wandering outside since young, man Xing’s face was full of disbelief. He continued, “Father, has this matter been confirmed? Is Miss Ye really the eldest sister?” ”

“”Basically, it has been confirmed.”Man Jiangshan nodded. “She is your eldest sister.” ”

“In this world, no parent would mistake their own child. ”

“Just like Zhao Dan, it was almost the first time that man Jiangshan saw ye Zhuo. He could confirm that she was the full moon who had disappeared for many years. ”

“MAN XING continued, “Then when will you and mother bring your eldest sister back?” ”

Man Jiangshan looked out of the window. “Your elder sister is still angry. We don’t know when she will come back.”

“”Elder sister has been wandering outside for so many years. It’s normal for her to be angry.”Man Xing gave man Jiangshan a vigorous massage. “Dad, I think we should all go to changyue to invite elder sister.” ”

All of them?

It was true that ye Zhuo was the ruler of Chang Yue.

“But no matter how powerful she was, she was still the daughter of Man Jiangshan, the descendant of their entire family. ”

“If it was really the whole family, ye Zhuo would think that she was very powerful! ”

She must not develop such an arrogant character for her before she recognized ye Zhuo.

“Man Jiangshan said, “You and Wen Er just stay at home. Leave the rest to your mother. As for the matter of the full moon, you don’t have to worry about it.” ”

“”Okay.”Man Xing nodded, “Dad, if anything happens to eldest sister, please remember to tell me. Eldest sister grew up in a different environment from me and Man Wen. We have to consider many things from her point of view.” ”

Man Wen was man Xing’s younger brother.

“Man Jiangshan turned to look at man Xing, his eyes filled with satisfaction. He had a total of three children in his life, and only man Xing suited him the most. ”

“Man Xing was not only sensible, beautiful, and talented. He was a lucky star. Man Jiangshan had always believed that it was all man Xing’s fault that man Xing had developed to this point! ”

“If it were not for man Xing, man Xing would have perished a long time ago. ”

Man Xing simply had no flaws.

“Man Jiangshan sighed, “If your eldest sister was half as sensible as you, your mother and I wouldn’t have to worry so much.” ”

“”Dad, please don’t say that,”man Xing continued, “If eldest sister heard what you said, she would definitely be sad. “She received a completely different education from me when she was young, and her family environment is also different. No one is perfect. If I had the life experience of my eldest sister, I’m afraid I would have been defeated by reality.” ”

Ye Zhuo had been starving since she was young. The people and things she saw were all at the lowest level.

“Meanwhile, she was well-fed, receiving the highest level of education, and her friends were all nobles. ”

“Naturally, these two people could not be compared ”

“If it were anyone else, they would not have ye Zhuo’s achievements. ”

“However, man Jiangshan did not think so. He smiled and said, “Xing ‘er, I’m not bragging. If you were her, you would only be more outstanding than her.” ”

Man Xing was the daughter of Man Jiangshan. No one knew man Xing better than his father.

“After coming out of man Jiangshan’s office, man Xing returned to the study room. ” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Sister!”

Man Xing looked up at the youth outside the door. “What’s Wrong?”

“Give me money.”The youth walked in and looked at man Xing like a master.

“You want money again?”Man Xing frowned slightly. “Didn’t I just give you a card a few days ago? You Can’t go on like this! A man is a man. Money is all he talks about. How can he support his family in the future?”

“”Don’t I Still Have You?”Man Wen sprawled on the chair. “Besides, without my good-for-nothing, how can you show Off Your Excellence?” ”

“Man Wen! You’re already nineteen years old this year!”Man Xing said.

“In manxing country, a 16-year-old would be an adult. ”

Man Wen was already nineteen years old!

A 19-year-old person didn’t have any character at all. He only knew how to play with women and hang out with his friends. He was simply a good-for-nothing.

“Even Manxing, his biological sister, was a little disappointed. ”

“”So what if he’s 19?”Manwen said speechlessly, “He’s not your younger brother at 19?” ”

“How much does it cost?”Manxing asked.
