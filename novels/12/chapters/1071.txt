“Zhang Peng carefully walked over from behind. “Then what sister Xueyin, I’ll be leaving first.” ”

Zhao Xueyin nodded.

Zhang Peng immediately ran away.

...

“Just as Zhang Peng walked out of the restaurant, he saw ye burning get into an SUV that was extremely cool. ”

“A few seconds later, the SUV disappeared into the traffic. ”

“Zhang Peng stood there with his mouth agape. After a long while, he said in a daze, “So Cool!” ”

This was the first time Zhang Peng had seen a girl drive a car so well.

He did not know what Zhao Xueyin was thinking. She actually thought that he could catch up to a girl like ye Zao!

“Thinking of this, Zhang Peng shook his head speechlessly. ”

In the SUV.

Ye Zao received a call.

It was from Cen Jiang. Ye Zao held the steering wheel with one hand and picked up the phone with the other. “Hello.”

“”Miss Ye, it’s me.” ”

“”Speak,”ye Zao said concisely. ”

“”Miss Ye, do you have time to come to the base now?” ”

“There was a crossroad ahead, so ye Zao was going straight. Hearing this, he suddenly turned the steering wheel. “I’ll be there soon.” ”

Chi —

“The tires scraped against the ground, creating a cloud of green smoke. ”

The driver in the car behind was stunned. “D * MN! This woman is too fierce!”

“Half an hour later, the handsome SUV stopped steadily at the entrance of the base. ”

“The car door opened, and a handsome and slender figure leaned out of the car. There was light snow floating in the air, and it was unknown what had turned into a heavy snowfall. The sky was filled with flying snow, and the figure in the wine-red coat.., it was as dazzling as the red plum blossoms blooming in the cold winter. ”

“”Is that Miss Ye?”Just then, the gate of the base opened, and two little girls walked out. ”

“It’s Miss Ye!”

The round-faced little girl’s eyes were almost sparkling. “Miss Ye is so beautiful! No wonder even master five was conquered!”

“As they spoke, Ye Zhuo had already walked in front of the two. ”

“The round-faced girl mustered up her courage and said, “Miss Ye!” ”

“Hello.”Ye Zhuo lowered his eyes slightly.

“After receiving ye Zhuo’s reply, the round-faced girl was so excited that she almost jumped up. She did not expect ye Zhuo to respond to her. ” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“The round-faced girl continued, “Miss Ye, can we... can we take a photo with you?” ”

“Sure.”Ye Zhuo never refused a kind request.

“That’s Great!”

“After successfully taking a photo with Ye Zhuo, the two girls were still a little confused. ”

Who would have thought that ye Zhuo would be so approachable?

“The round-faced girl held her phone and said, “Miss ye is really, really great!” ”

On the other side.

“Ye Zhuo had already walked to the office. Just as he took off his coat, someone knocked on the office door. ”

“”Come in,”ye Zao said faintly. ”

“Cen Jiang jogged out of the office and looked at Ye Zao. “Miss Ye, you’re finally here!” ”

“”What happened?”Ye Zao rolled up his sleeves, revealing a fair and beautiful arm. ”

“Cen Jiang continued, “There was a technical problem during the construction process. You may need to come over personally to take a look.” ”

“Okay.”

Ye Zhuo followed Cen Jiang to the construction warehouse.

“The construction warehouse was very large, covering an area of 10 hectares. At this time, the plan to develop an aircraft carrier was already in full swing. Everyone was doing their jobs in an orderly manner. ”

“”Old Nie! Old Nie! Miss Ye Is Here!”Just as they stepped into the construction warehouse, Cen Jiang pressed the communicator on his chest. ”

“”Team leader Cen Jiang, we are in area c.”old Nie’s voice came from the other end of the communicator. ”

“Cen Jiang turned to look at Ye Zhuo. “Miss Ye, come with me.” ”

Ye Zhuo followed Cen Jiang’s footsteps.

Old Nie and a group of researchers were discussing the welding work in Area C.

“Aircraft carriers were space tools, so the welding work had to be precise. However, they had found many masters, but they were unable to do it exactly as described in the blueprint. ”

“Cen Jiang brought ye Zhuo to old nie and the group of researchers. “Old NIE, let me introduce you. This is Miss Ye.” ”

Old Nie looked up and saw ye Zao with long hair draped over his shoulders.

The little girl was very beautiful.

It was just that...

She was a little young.

Too Young!

“When old nie first received the aircraft carrier design from Cen Jiang, he was still full of confidence. He felt that this miss ye, whom he had never met before, would definitely be able to lead them to develop the most powerful aircraft carrier and make the whole world cheer for them! ”

“When old nie first saw the aircraft carrier design, he was shocked, but now he was disappointed. ”

This...

Wasn’t she just a little girl?

She looked a few years younger than his daughter.
