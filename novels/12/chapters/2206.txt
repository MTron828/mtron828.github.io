“Director Zhao knelt on the ground, his expression pained. ”

“Man Wen stood up from his chair and said, “Since there are no accomplices, I can only do things professionally. Men!” ”

“As soon as he said that, someone immediately walked in from outside. “Mr. President!” ”

“Man Wen continued, “Zhao Shan Dong embezzled...” ”

“Before he could finish, Zhao Shan Dong said, “I’ll tell you! I’ll tell you! I’ll tell you everything!” ”

“His daughter was Zhao Shan Dong’s lifeline. Everything he did was for his daughter. No matter what, he could not let his daughter get hurt. ”

“For his daughter, he would give up everything! ”

Man Wen lowered his eyes and glanced at Zhao Shan Dong before waving his hand.

The guards standing behind Zhao Shan Dong immediately retreated.

Man Wen threw a pen and a piece of paper to Zhao Shandong. “Write down everything you know on this.”

Zhao Shandong picked up the pen and paper.

On the other side.

Cen Shaoqing and ye Zhuo walked hand in hand on the Flowing Street.

“This was the main street of the main alliance. It was bustling with lights, wine, and traffic. It was especially bustling. ”

“However, even such a bustling scene had become the backdrop for the two of them. It had become the most eye-catching scenery in the city without a sound. ”

“I’ve already settled most of my matters here. I’ll be able to return in two days.”Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted slightly. “Do you think the day after tomorrow will do?”

“”The day after tomorrow might not do. Let’s Wait a little longer,”ye Zao said. ”

“CEN Shaoqing asked, “Have you not settled the matter with man Wen?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“She did not want to interfere in the matters of the man family either. However, man Wen was her biological younger brother after all. Moreover, no matter which angle one looked at it from, Man Wen was a qualified younger brother. ”

“Before dealing with the matter of man Wen, even if she went back, Ye Zhuo wouldn’t be at ease. ”

“Why don’t you go back first?”Ye Zhuo looked at Cen Shaoqing.

“I’m not in a hurry.”Cen Shaoqing held the Buddha bead in his left hand. “I’ll go back when you go back.”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

In a 33-story building on the side.

“A young and beautiful woman was sitting by the window. She witnessed everything on the street, and her eyes were filled with viciousness. ”

She was now very sure that Ye Zao was the full moon.

But she didn’t understand why ye Zao and Zhao Dan’s personal relationship didn’t work out.

What exactly happened?

“If it was the result of the parent-child relationship, she would be standing by Cen Shaoqing’s side now. ”

She would never be as selfish as ye Zhuo and request Cen Shaoqing to return to Earth.

She would always be by Cen Shaoqing’s side.

Unfortunately.

She did not have the chance.

“The paternity test was done, man Jiangshan and Zhao Dan were no longer alive. There was no evidence to prove that ye Zhuo was a full moon. ”

“However, man Xing was not convinced. ”

She and Ye Zhuo were sisters from the same mother. She was born noble and was respected by the world. Why did she become like this now?

She should have been more outstanding than ye Zao!

How could ye Zao enjoy all of this with peace of mind.

All of this should have been hers.

Ye Zao.

It was all ye Zao. It was ye Zao who took what belonged to her.

“Ye Zao, this Shameless B * TCH. If it was not for ye Zao’s interference, things would not have become like this. ”

“If it was not for ye Zao, she would already be the president of Manxing Country. What would happen to Manwen? ”

She was also ye Zao’s sister. Why did ye Zao Only Treat Manwen Well? CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Did Ye Zao put her sister in his heart when he did this.

Why!

Why!

“No matter how Manxing thought about it, she could not figure out why? ”

Why did ye Zao not help her even when he helped Manwen.

She was obviously much better than Manwen!

Manxing’s mind was completely filled with hatred.

Pa..

She smashed an antique vase.

The pieces scattered all over the ground.

“Xing ‘Er.”Master Cao pushed the door open and entered. He was shocked by the scene in front of him.

Manxing only reacted when she heard master Cao’s voice. She turned around and looked at master Cao. “Master.”

“What happened to you?”

“”Nothing.”In just a moment, man Xing’s face did not look any different. “I just accidentally broke a vase.” ”

“Master Cao Glanced at man Xing and continued, “Xing ‘er, don’t think too much now. Everything will be done according to the plan. This time, there will be no mistakes.” ”

“”Master,”man Xing suddenly said. ”

“What’s Wrong?”Master Cao looked up.

“Man Xing continued, “Ye Zhuo is the full moon.” ”

“What did you say?”Master Cao was a little shocked.
