“Although she looked normal now, the toxins in her body could threaten her life at any time if she couldn’t get rid of them. ”

“Thinking of this, an itch suddenly appeared in Old Lady Lin’s throat. She covered her mouth and coughed desperately. ”

“In the end, the people in the room acted as if they didn’t see her. ”

Especially ye Zao.

“Ye Zao was also a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner, but she turned a blind eye to it. ”

“At a time like this, she still had the mood to play with her five children. ”

This was her biological granddaughter.

Her biological granddaughter.

“She had already apologized to ye Zao, so why couldn’t Ye Zao forgive her? ”

“Now, she was already critically ill. ”

But Ye Zao did not save her.

“The more she thought about it, the more uncomfortable she felt. Her heart was filled with anger. At this moment, she suddenly thought of Feng Xianxian. ”

“If it was Feng Xianxian, she would definitely not be like ye Zao. ”

Feng Xianxian was a good and understanding child. She would definitely understand her.

“Thinking of this, Old Lady Lin went to the kitchen and instructed the servants to bring food to Feng Xianxian. “Xianxian that girl likes seafood. Auntie Wang, please prepare more seafood.” ”

“After saying that, old Mrs. Lin instructed, “Sister Wang, remember to tell Xianxian that the weather is getting colder. Tell her to take good care of herself. If she needs anything, remember to call me and tell me not to trouble herself.” ”

“”Okay.”Sister Wang said, “I will tell Miss Feng.” ”

“After thinking for a while, old Mrs. Lin continued, “Forget it, sister Wang. I’ll go with you to see Xianxian.” ”

“Auntie Wang asked in surprise, “You’re going to Miss Feng’s residence too?” ”

Old Lady Lin nodded.

It had been a long time since she had seen Feng Xianxian. She wouldn’t be at ease if she didn’t go with Auntie Wang personally.

They got into the car and followed Auntie Wang to Feng Xianxian’s residence. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“After Feng Xianxian left the Feng family, she was currently renting an ordinary residential area. ”

“Because the parking spaces in the residential area were tight, they did not allow outside vehicles to enter. Old Lady Lin and Auntie Wang got out of the car and walked into the residential area. ”

“Old Lady Lin had never been to such a residential area. As soon as she stepped into the residential area, she frowned in disgust. ”

“Dirty, messy, broken! ”

“If she was not careful, she would even step on the feces of stray cats and dogs. ”

How was this a place for humans to live?

Old Lady Lin looked at Auntie Wang and frowned. “Xianxian has been living here during this period of time?”

“Yes.”Auntie Wang nodded.

Old Lady Lin’s frown deepened.

“After all, Feng Xianxian was raised in her hands. How could she live in such a shabby place? ”

“In a short while, the two of them arrived at the unit that Feng Xianxian was currently living in. ”

Feng Xianxian lived on the third floor and did not have an elevator.

“When they reached the third floor, Old Lady Lin was so tired that she could hardly breathe. She could not imagine how Feng Xianxian could adapt to it. ”

It was all Feng Qianhua’s fault!

This was all Feng Qianhua’s fault!

“If it was not for that vicious woman, Feng Qianhua, how could Feng Xianxian end up here today? ”

A good child does not have a good mother.

“The More Old Lady Lin thought about it, the more her heart ached for Feng Xianxian. ”

Sister-in-law Wang reached out to knock on the door.

“Very soon, the door opened. ”

“Seeing the person outside the door, Feng Xianxian said in surprise, “Grandma, Why are you here!” ”

“Old Lady Lin said with red eyes, “Xianxian, you’ve suffered! Why didn’t you tell Grandma before that you live in a place like this?”Every Time Old Lady Lin, wen, and Feng Xianxian were living well, feng Xianxian smiled and said that she was living well and did not need Old Lady Lin’s help. ”

Old Lady Lin thought that Feng Xianxian was really living well.

She did not expect...

This child had been lying to her.

“The More Old Lady Lin thought about it, the more uncomfortable she felt. ”

“She felt sorry for Feng Xianxian for not having a mother at such a young age, but also for her understanding. ”

“As long as Feng Xianxian told her the truth, she would not let Feng Xianxian live in a place like this. ”

“Feng Xianxian smiled and said, “Grandma, this place is actually very good. You Don’t have to worry about me. There are thousands of residents in our neighborhood! If other people can live in it, why can’t I?” ”

Old Lady Lin Sighed.

“Feng Xianxian continued, “Grandma, please come in and take a seat.” ”

Old Lady Lin followed Feng Xianxian into the house.

It was a very small space.

“The bathroom and the kitchen were all squeezed together. There wasn’t even a window. The moment they walked in, they felt suffocated and their nostrils were filled with a damp and moldy smell. ”

This place couldn’t even compare to the Lin family manor’s toilets.

“Old Lady Lin couldn’t stay for even half a second. She grabbed Feng Xianxian’s wrist and said, “Let’s Go! Xianxian, let’s Go! We’re not staying here anymore!” ”
