Translator: 549690339

Elder Zhang looked up with a smile. “What’s the matter?”

“Cao Wei said, “I haven’t seen you all day. You didn’t pick up my calls. If you don’t come back soon, I’m going to call the police!” ”

“”I went to Lingyun Temple! Maybe there was no signal in the mountains, so I didn’t see you when I left, so I didn’t tell you.”Elder Zhang looked at Cao Wei, sweeping away the snow on his body, he asked, “By the way, how are the preparations for the welcoming banquet going?” ”

“Cao Wei continued, “Don’t worry, everything is ready.” ”

Elder Zhang nodded. “That’s good! When are the dates set?”

“Cao Wei continued, “I wanted to talk to you about this! I’ve looked for Lingyun Temple’s master and he said that the 26th and 28th days are more suitable for the welcoming banquet. Which Day do you think is suitable for these two days?” ”

The welcoming banquet was not a small matter. They had to arrange a good day.

People in the financial world believed in these things.

“However, the exact date was up to elder Zhang. ”

“Solar calendar?”Elder Zhang asked.

“Yes.”Cao Wei nodded.

“Elder Zhang continued, “Then let’s make it 26th. Today is the 23rd day of the solar calendar. There are still three days left. Can We make it in three days?” ”

“”We can make it in time.”Cao Wei continued, “Then I’ll make the arrangements.” ” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Okay.”

“After saying that, elder Zhang added, “Remember to hold this welcoming banquet in a grand manner! All the important figures in the financial world must send an invitation!” ”

“”Then, should DK consortium send it?”Cao Wei hesitated and asked. ”

DK consortium was ranked first in the international financial rankings.

It was also the only Chinese consortium in the top three of the international rankings.

DK Consortium?

“Elder Zhang frowned. “Forget about DK. Even if we give them an invitation, they might not like us.”Why did he have to be so cold? ”

“”Okay.”Cao Wei nodded. “It’s already so late. You must have not eaten yet, right? I asked the kitchen to save some food for you. Please go in and eat.” ”

Elder Zhang was indeed hungry after coming back so late. He quickened his pace and walked in.

Time passed quickly.

“In the blink of an eye, the next day arrived. ”

Cen Shaoqing drove ye Zhuo to the financial world.

Elder Zhang had been waiting for the entrance of Shunxi Financial Group for a long time.

“At 10:10 am, Cen Shaoqing’s car stopped at the entrance of Shunxi Financial Group on time. ”

Elder Zhang immediately went up to greet him. “Zhuozhuo! CEN fifth Master!”

On the 58th floor of Shunxi Financial Group.

“Zhao Xueyin stood in front of the French window, holding a telescope in her hand as she looked downstairs. ”

Cen Shaoqing had actually come.

It looked like ye Zhuo had really fallen in love with Cen Shaoqing.

The corners of Zhao Xueyin’s lips curled up.

The lawyer put down the binoculars. “Who is the man standing next to Ye Zhuo?”

“”Cen Shaoqing,”Zhao Xueyin said slowly. “Ye Zhuo’s boyfriend.” ”

“Ye Zhuo has a boyfriend?”The lawyer was very surprised.

“”Yes.”Zhao Xueyin nodded slightly. “As you said, Ye Zhuo has followed in ye Langhua’s footsteps.” ”

“Not only did she follow in ye Langhua’s footsteps, she would be even more miserable than ye Langhua in the future. ”

“Back then, ye Langhua was very infatuated with Xi Muwen. ”

“However, she hadn’t reached ye Zhuo’s level yet. ”

Si Lu picked up the binoculars and looked down again.

He didn’t know why.

He still felt like he had seen Cen Shaoqing somewhere before. “This person is so familiar.”

“Who?”Zhao Xueyin asked.

“”Cen Shaoqing,”the lawyer answered. ”

“Zhao Xueyin said, “Cen Shaoqing has been on camera with Ye Zhuo. You might have seen him on television.” ”

“Maybe.”The lawyer still felt that it was a little strange.

Cen Shaoqing?

The Bai Family?

Could it be that Cen Shaoqing was related to DK Financial Group?

“Although he thought so in his heart, he did not say it out loud. ”

What if he was wrong?

“If Cen Shaoqing was really related to the Bai family, would he take a fancy to Ye Zhuo? ”

“After saying that, Zhao Xueyin put down the binoculars and turned to look at Si lui. “Miss Ye has officially returned to XI Financial Group. Brother Si, please go to the door to welcome her on my behalf.” ”

“Okay.”Si lui nodded.

“Not long after, Si lui appeared downstairs. “Elder Zhang.” ”

“Chairman Si.”Elder Zhang nodded slightly.

“The lawyer looked at Ye Zhuo. “Elder Zhang, this must be Miss Ye, right?” ”

This was the first time the lawyer had seen ye Zhuo in person.

She was very beautiful.

“She was more than three times brighter than on television, and her facial features were very recognizable. ”

“Unfortunately, she was too impetuous. ”

“Perhaps it was because she had become famous at a young age, coupled with the fact that she was grandfather Ye’s descendant, she could clearly see the shadow of arrogance in Ye Zhuo. ”

Compared to Zhao Xueyin.

Ye Zao’s difference was not just a little bit.

“The lawyer was most disgusted with Ye Zao, who was shamed by his ancestors and relied on his connections to get to the top. ”
