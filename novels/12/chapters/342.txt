The eyes are the window to the soul.

“In her past and present life, Ye Zhuo had seen all kinds of people. It was not the first time she had seen someone like Bai Wei who was good at disguising herself. ”

“”Dance teacher,”ye Sen replied. ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled slightly, “People who practice dance all year round will have especially developed leg muscles, and they won’t be able to lose weight. Look at Bai Wei’s legs, the muscles are loose and have no elasticity. It’s obvious that it’s caused by a lack of exercise! “Uncle, do you think a dancing teacher will have a lack of exercise?” ”

“Dancing mainly depended on the movement of the legs. Over time, the legs would form strong muscles, which became thicker and thicker. The muscles were especially developed. ”

“Looking at Bai Wei’s legs, she didn’t look like a person who practiced dancing all year round. ”

“Ye Sen was stunned, and his eyes were full of disbelief. ”

“Seeing ye Sen like this, Ye Zao took a bite of an apple. “Uncle, if you don’t believe me, you can look at your arm. You deliver packages all year round, so the muscles in your arm must be more developed than normal people.” ”

Ye Sen lowered his head and looked at his arm.

The muscles were indeed very developed.

“Ye Sen licked his lips. “Your Aunt Bai pays a lot of attention to her figure. Every time she orders a meal, she only orders a vegetable salad. Her thin legs may have something to do with her self-discipline.” ”

“”Dancing is a sport that consumes a lot of physical energy. For example, if you only eat a few vegetable leaves every day to deliver packages, can you run?”Ye Zao continued to bite the apple, “Even if her thin legs are related to diet, what about her lack of muscles on her legs? You should know that being thin has nothing to do with muscles, right?” ”

Ye Zao’s words were very reasonable and there was no way to refute it.

Ye Sen’s face was slightly pale.

Could it be that Bai Wei really lied to him?

“After saying that.., ye Zao continued, “Uncle, look at Bai Wei’s face again. Although her makeup today is very appropriate, no matter how thick the makeup is, it can’t hide the tired look on her face. Her eyes are still slightly red. Do you know what caused this?” ”

Ye Sen shook his head.

“Ye Zao threw the apple core away. “This is caused by often staying up all night and turning day and night upside down. This means that Bai Wei is most likely not a dance teacher at all, but often works the night shift.” ”

“With that, the apple core fell into the trash can ten meters away without any error. ”

“Maybe she often stays up all night? Don’t young people nowadays like to stay up all night?”Ye Sen asked in return.

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Staying up late and staying up all night are two different concepts. Simply staying up late doesn’t have the same situation as her. From her looks, she has been upside down for more than ten years.” ”

Ye Sen was stunned again.

“If what ye Zao said was true, then what exactly did Bai Wei Do? ”

Why did she lie to him?

“”Uncle, there are a lot of jobs on the night shift. Have you ever thought about why Bai Wei didn’t tell you about her work and instead said that she was a dance teacher?”Ye Zao asked. ”

“In fact, ye Zao already had the answer in his heart. ”

The culture of Chinese medicine was extensive and profound.

“From Bai Wei’s facial features and walking posture, one could tell that she was a person with a rich nightlife. ”

“”I. . . I don’t know.”Ye Sen’s face was expressionless. He raised his head to look at Ye Zao. “Zao Zao, are you mistaken? Besides, can you tell that Bai Wei often works the night shift just by looking at her?” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Do you know what traditional Chinese medicine emphasizes?” ”

“I don’t know.”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Traditional Chinese medicine emphasizes looking, smelling, asking, and cutting. Looking depends on the complexion; smelling, listening to the other party’s breath; asking, referring to asking about the symptoms; cutting; feeling the pulse. When an insider looks at Bai Wei’s complexion, he can tell that she often works the night shift.” ”

Ye Sen was speechless.

“”Uncle, do you not believe what I Said?” ”

“”I don’t believe it,”Ye Sen said. ”

“After all, Bai Wei was his girlfriend. He really couldn’t accept ye Zhuo suddenly telling him this. ”

How could this be?

Bai Wei was obviously a very good girl.

“Ye Zhuo smiled slightly. “If you don’t believe it, I have a way to verify whether what I said is true.” ”

“What Way?”

Ye Zao walked to Ye Sen’s side and whispered to him.

Ye Sen nodded.

“Soon, the meal was ready. ”

“Ye Sen went to the kitchen to serve the dishes. When he saw Bai Wei, he wanted to ask all the questions in his heart, but when he thought of ye Zao’s words, he held back and tried to pretend that nothing had happened. ” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“”Bai Wei, thank you for your hard work today.” ”
