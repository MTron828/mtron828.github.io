“The driver took the money and realized that song Chenyu looked familiar. “You, you are that Big Celebrity Song Chenyu, right?””

“Although song Chenyu was wearing a mask, one could vaguely see his facial features. In addition, Cen Yuyan was wearing extraordinary clothes and even called Song Chenyu Chenyu Chenyu Chenyu Chenyu Chenyu Chenyu. Therefore, the driver immediately thought of Song Chenyu.”

“Song Chenyu said, “You have the wrong person.””

“”I didn’t get the wrong person! You are that Big Celebrity, song Chenyu! I have seen the reality show that you participated in.”The driver said excitedly, “Big celebrity, can you give me an autograph?””

Autograph?

Give it to such a person?

“Song Chenyu continued, “I’m sorry, you really got the wrong person. I have other things to do.””

“After saying that, he pulled Cen Yuyan away.”

The chauffeur quickly took out his phone and took a few photos of Song Chenyu’s back.

“Song Chenyu and Cen Yuyan chatted as they walked. “Yuyan, why did you suddenly come back? Didn’t Zhou Rui send you back?””

“”Don’t mention it!”Cen Yuyan frowned. “Sometimes, I wonder if I’m my mother’s biological daughter!””

Song Chenyu was stunned. “What happened?”

Cen Yuyan told Song Chenyu about what happened at the Cen family.

“Hearing this, song Chenyu frowned slightly.”

“The Cen family and Cen Yuyan were in such a mess, which was beyond song Chenyu’s expectations. “Yuyan, didn’t I tell you not to quarrel with Aunty and Grandma? If you have something to say, say it properly. After all, they are doing it for your own good.””

“There’s no way to say it properly.”Cen Yuyan was still angry at the mention of this matter. “You didn’t see the way my grandma looked at that time!”

Old Mrs. Cen looked as if she had done something outrageous.

She wanted nothing more than to slap her to death.

“Song Chenyu continued, “But I think Grandma likes miss ye quite a lot.”? Zhou Rui and miss ye are about the same age and are both young people. Why is there such a big difference? “Is it because Zhou Rui’s performance isn’t good enough to make Grandma Unhappy?””

“Biased!”Cen Yuyan sneered. “My Grandma personally took a liking to ye Zao. How could she not like him? I chose Zhou Rui myself. She just doesn’t like Zhou Rui in any way!”

“In the past, Cen Yuyan only felt that old Mrs. Cen was a little muddle-headed due to her age, and that she couldn’t recognize people clearly.”

It was only now that Cen Yuyan finally understood.

“Not only was old Mrs. Cen muddle-headed due to her age, she couldn’t recognize people clearly, and she was even biased.”

“Putting her biological granddaughter aside, she didn’t like her biological grandson-in-law and liked an outsider instead.”

It was polite to say that she couldn’t recognize people clearly!

It was simply extremely stupid! RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Cen Yuyan was so angry that her liver hurt whenever she thought of old lady cen talking about Zhou Rui like that.

“Song Chenyu continued, “Then what do you plan to do now? After all, they are your family. Do you really want to sever ties with them?””

“”As long as I can be with Zhou Rui, I’m willing to do anything!”Cen Yuyan had a determined look on her face.”

“Then does Zhou Rui know about this?”Song Chenyu asked.

Cen Yuyan shook her head. “I haven’t told him yet.”

“Song Chenyu continued, “Yuyan, I feel that you’ve acted a little too rashly in this matter. Although Aunty and Grandma are temporarily unable to accept Zhou Rui, you can slowly persuade them. Why do you have to make things so difficult for them?””

“Cen Yuyan said, “I just want to use practical actions to tell them that Zhou Rui isn’t the kind of person they say he is! “I like Zhou Rui, and Zhou Rui likes me too! “Even if I’m not the Cen family’s fourth young miss, Zhou Rui will still treat me as usual! “Chenyu, do you understand? “I just can’t swallow that anger!””

“To Cen Yuyan, Zhou Rui was the most important person in her life. No one could insult Zhou Rui.”

Cen Yuyan would definitely be angry if old madam Cen directly called Zhou Rui a gigolo?

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “Don’t worry, Zhou Rui is definitely not that kind of person. When the time comes, your family will definitely regret it.””

“”Chenyu, the only person who understands me now is you.”Cen Yuyan hugged song Chenyu.”

“Song Chenyu patted Cen Yuyan’s back, “Silly, actually, your family also cares about you. Otherwise, they wouldn’t object to you being together with Zhou Rui. The reason why they object to you being together with Zhou Rui is because they don’t understand Zhou Rui. “They think that Zhou Rui is here for your identity, but in reality, he’s not. As time goes by, People’s hearts will be revealed. I believe that one day, they will understand you and bless you.””

“What did he mean by a true best friend, a true good friend!”
