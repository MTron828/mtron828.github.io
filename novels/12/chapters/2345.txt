“Standing on the long street of the capital and looking at the bustling crowd, elder Bai’s eyes suddenly turned sour. ”

“He remembered the first time he set foot on this land. He was twenty years old. In the blink of an eye, sixty-three years had passed. ”

“Sixty-three years, more than twenty thousand days and nights. The earth had changed a lot. ”

“Is Chang ‘an street in front?”Elder Bai asked slowly.

“”Yes.”Lin ze nodded and continued, “Grandpa, have you been to the capital before?” ”

“”Yes.”Elder Bai did not deny it. He continued, “When I came here, the capital was not like this.” ”

“Looking at the familiar Chang ‘an street, he felt as if he had returned to the past. ”

“Bai Jingshu said in surprise, “Grandpa, you actually came to Earth. I’ve never heard you mention it before.” ”

“”That was many years ago.”Elder Bai smiled with tears in his eyes. “If I hadn’t returned to Earth today, I would have forgotten about it.” ”

“Elder Bai seemed to have thought of something. He straightened his body and said, “Jingshu, let’s go to your place first.” ”

“There’s no need to go to Jingshu’s place. My parents have arranged a hotel for you. Please wait for a moment. They’re on their way.”

“”No, no, no, this is too troublesome!”Elder Bai waved his hand. ”

“”Jingshu, Ah Ze!” ”

“At this moment, Ye Shu’s voice sounded in the air. ”

Bai Jingshu looked up. “It’s uncle and Auntie! Auntie!”

“Elder Bai scrutinized the two figures walking over. From their looks, ye Shu and Lin Jincheng were very kind people. ”

“Ye Shu and Lin Jincheng walked over. “This is Jingshu’s grandfather, Old Master Bai, right?” ”

“I am.”Old Master Bai nodded. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Lin Jincheng immediately stretched out his hand towards old master Bai. “Hello, Old Master. I Am Lin Ze’s father, Lin Jincheng. This is my wife, ye Shu!” ”

“”Hello, Old Master.”Ye Shu followed behind. ”

“”Mr. Lin, Mrs. Lin,”Old Master Bai said. ”

“Lin Jincheng smiled and said, “Old Master, you’re an elder. You can just call us by our names. We were supposed to visit you, but you came instead. I’m Sorry!” ”

“”It’s the same for the children. It doesn’t matter who comes,”old master Bai said with a smile. ”

“Lin Jincheng continued, “Old Master, let’s go to the hotel first. If you don’t want to stay in a hotel, you can stay in our manor!” ”

“Old Master Bai said, “It’s fine for me to stay at Jingshu’s place. Xiao Lin’s parents, you don’t have to do anything.” ”

“How can we do that! You came all the way here. We should let you stay at the best place!”Lin Jincheng said.

“”There’s really no need.”Old Master Bai smiled and said, “We’re all family. I Won’t stand on ceremony with you. If I want to stay at a hotel, I’ll just stay there.” ”

“Hearing elder Bai’s words, Lin Jincheng no longer insisted. ”

There was actually another reason why elder Bai insisted on staying at Bai Jingshu’s place. He wanted to observe on the spot if Bai Jingshu’s life on earth had been good.

Elder Bai stayed in the capital for three days.

“On the first day, he agreed with Lin Jincheng and Ye Shu on the wedding date for Lin Ze and Bai Jingshu. ”

The date was set for the eighth day of the next month.

“Although the time was a little tight, it was enough to use the time to prepare for the wedding. ”

“On the second and third day, elder Bai walked around the places he had walked around many years ago. ”

“He was old, and Bai Jingshu wanted to follow him, but elder Bai didn’t let her. ”

“The scenery and things were still the same, but the person from back then was long gone. ”

“Looking at the peach blossom sticking out from the wall, a poem appeared in front of Old Master Bai’s eyes. ”

“His face was nowhere to be seen, and the peach blossom was still smiling in the spring breeze. ”

“Looking at the swaying peach blossom in the wind, Old Master Bai’s eyes instantly turned red. ”

What was Life?

“If time could be repeated, he would definitely say goodbye to his past self and follow his heart. ”

What a pity.

There was no longer any youth left in him. All that was left for him was endless regret.

“On the fourth day, Old Master Bai followed Bai Jingzhu back to the s galaxy. ”

“After returning to the s galaxy, Bai Jingzhu was at the old residence preparing for the wedding. ”

“When Bai Sanfeng found out about this, she was so angry that she shook her head. “This is crazy! Just wait and see. Sooner or later, the two of them will regret it!” ”
