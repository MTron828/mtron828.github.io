Translator: 549690339

Sun Yiguo also apologized.

He looked as humble as he could be.

“Not to mention Old Lady Lin, even Feng Qianhua and Feng Xianxian were stunned. ”

What happened to Zhang Haiyuan?

“There was also Sun Yiguo, who was beside Zhang Haiyuan. ”

“If they were not mistaken, Sun Yiguo was the founder of female Durban! ”

“Ye Zao raised his eyes slightly. “Alright, you can go back now.” ”

“”Thank you, Miss Ye!” ”

The two of them felt as if they had been granted amnesty and quickly turned around to leave.

“This scene made Feng Qianhua, her mother, and Old Lady Lin a little dumbfounded. ”

Especially Feng Xianxian. Her face was filled with disbelief and her face was slightly pale.

What was Ye Zao’s background?

Why were Sun Yiguo and Zhang Haiyuan so afraid of her?

Could it be... because of fifth master Cen?

“After all, Fifth Master Cen was an existence that could control the skies in the capital. ”

“She originally thought that after ye Zao entered female Durban, he would no longer pose a threat to her. ”

She did not expect...

This little slut’s methods were really brilliant!

“Ye Zao clapped his hands and stood up from his chair. “Grandma, if there’s nothing else, I’ll go back first.” ”

For a moment.

Old Madam Lin actually forgot to react and let ye Zhuo leave just like that.

Because all of this was really too mystical.

Who would have thought that the two female Durban leaders would worship ye Zhuo as their ancestor?

“After a long while, old madam Lin finally reacted and turned to look at Aunt Zhang. “Aunt Zhang, give a call to the female Durban to ask what’s going on!” ”

“Okay.”Aunt Zhang nodded.

“Sun Yiguo originally wanted to send this living ancestor, Ye Zhuo, back in one piece and everything would be fine. ”

“Unexpectedly, on his way back, female Durban was banned because of its lack of business qualifications and illegal teaching. A few people in charge were also brought to the police station. Many media reporters came upon hearing the news and wanted to get first-hand news. ”

“At the same time, Aunt Zhang also heard the news and said with a slightly pale face, “Old, old lady, female Durban has been banned!” ”

“What?”Feng Qianhua said in surprise.

“A bitter smile appeared on Feng Xianxian’s lips. “This should be Cen Wuye’s handiwork, right? It seems that he really loves sister ye Zhuo to death...” ” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Seeing Feng Xianxian like this, Old Lady Lin’s heart ached terribly. She turned to look at Feng Xianxian, “Xianxian, don’t worry. Even if the sky collapses, grandma is still here! In My Heart, besides you, no one else is worthy of Shaoqing! Grandma will definitely make the decision for you!” ”

“Although Old Lady Lin was comforting her, Feng Xianxian still felt very uncomfortable in her heart. ”

What right did ye Zao have?

What right did he have to win Cen Shaoqing’s love and save himself from danger time and time again?

What was there in her body that was not comparable to ye Zao?

CEN fifth master should be hers!

What right did ye Zao have to compete with her?

She was just glad that ye Zao had entered female Durban.

“In less than three hours, she was slapped in the face! ”

How could this kind of feeling feel good?

...

“Ye Zao returned to his room and took a shower. Not long after, he wore a white halter top and a towel as he walked out of the bathroom. His wet hair was dripping water from his collarbone. ”

Thin waist and long legs.

It was a scene that made one’s blood boil.

“Walking to the small room on the right side of the bedroom, ye Zao opened the First Aid Kit and took out a syringe. He squeezed out the excess air inside and stabbed it into his arm. ”

“The sharp and thin syringe pierced through the veins. Soon, bright red blood was drawn out. It was clearly a shocking scene, but ye Zao did not even frown. ”

“After drawing a tube of blood, he randomly picked up a cotton swab and pressed it on the eye of the needle. Then, he squeezed the blood that had just been drawn out into ten mini-sized devices. ”

Ye Zao spent nearly half a month to develop these ten small devices to do blood tests.

“Because it had been a long time, the devices in this world were unable to detect blood problems. For the day when the truth was revealed, Ye Zao had personally developed one. ”

Beep —

The sound of the instrument could be heard in the air. Ye Zao looked at the changes on the instrument and raised his eyebrows slightly.

“According to the analysis results, the original owner had been fed a drug called piperazine when he was young. ”

The main effect of this drug was to suppress mental illness.

“However, if a normal person ate it by mistake, it would have the opposite effect and cause hallucinations. ”

“The original owner had just been born at that time, so he had become slower than a normal person. ”

To give such a small child such a drug...

What kind of vicious person would be able to do that?

“Ye Zao originally didn’t have much idea about this matter, but after staying in the Lin family for so long and getting to know Feng Qianhua and her daughter, she gradually had a sense of direction. ”

Feng Qianhua wanted to replace ye Shu and become Lin Jincheng’s wife.

“This matter definitely had something to do with Feng Qianhua, including deliberately swapping two children. It was definitely her doing. ”

“Thinking of this, Ye Zao turned on the computer, logged into the sky eye system, and continued to search for the truth of the incident back then. ”

“”Beautiful Big Zao, do you want to have some supper?”Xiao Bai slid in from outside the door. ”

“”I don’t want to eat,”ye Zao said without raising his head. “Help me find out who were the medical staff on duty in the obstetrics and gynecology department of Yunjing Hospital on the day I was born.” ”

Feng Qianhua wanted to switch out two children. It was impossible for her to do it alone without the help of the medical staff.

“After all, the Mu family’s position in Yunjing at that time was already very prominent. ”

And Ye Shu was only a single mother at that time. One was poor and the other rich. The wards they lived in were different. How could these two children be switched out?

“Okay!”

“Xiao Bai was very efficient. He quickly found the staff on duty. “Da Zhuozhu, there were ten nurses on duty in the obstetrics department and two doctors!” ”

“Ye Zhuozhu was born at three o’clock in the morning, so he only needed to check the doctors and nurses on the night shift. ”

“Read it for me.”

Xiao Bai read it slowly.

“When he heard a name, Ye Zhuozhu frowned slightly. “Xu Lanyue? Is this a doctor or a nurse?” ”

Xu Lanyue?

“If she remembered correctly, Feng Qianhua’s biological mother, sister-in-law Zhang’s original name was Xu Lanying. ”

Could it be that Xu Lanyue had some relationship with Xu Lanying?

“Xiao Baibai continued, “She’s a doctor.” ”
