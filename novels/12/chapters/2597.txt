Translator: 549690339

“Zhou cuihua said, “This is mine!” ”

“I bought it with my hard-earned money. Don’t even think about bringing it to that adulterer!”Li Da Long’s attitude was very firm.

“Zhou cuihua originally wanted to argue with him, but when she thought of how it was better to leave things alone, she did not say anything in the end. ”

“When she was like Xia Xiaoman and married a rich man, she would have all the jewelry she wanted? ”

What was this little piece of jewelry?

“Li dalong continued, “Zhou cuihua, you have to leave the house with nothing!” ”

“Do you really think you have any wealth?”Zhou cuihua looked up at Li Dalong. “I don’t want your things either!”

Li Dalong’s little things couldn’t even be compared to Lin Qingxuan’s little finger!

She really didn’t know where Li Dalong got his confidence from!

“Zhou Cui Hua tidied up her clothes and did not plan to take anything else. She continued, “I will be staying out tonight. Do you have any objections to meeting me at the entrance of the Civil Affairs Bureau at 9:30 Tomorrow Morning?” ”

“”Sure.”Since things had developed to this point, Li Da Long did not want to hide anything anymore. ”

Zhou Cui Hua turned around and went into the living room. She greeted Li Hang and was ready to leave.

“Li hang looked at Zhou Cuihua. “Mom, are you really leaving?” ”

Li Hang felt extremely uncomfortable when things developed to this point.

She didn’t expect her parents to walk down the path of divorce.

“Zhou cuihua nodded. “I can’t stay in this house for even a minute. Hang, if you don’t want to leave with mom, then mom will leave first.” ”

Li Hang couldn’t stop Zhou Cuihua and could only watch her leave.

“At this moment, the bedroom door was opened again. ”

“Wait a minute!”Li Da Long’s voice came from the air.

“What else do you want?”

Li Da Long walked in front of Zhou Cuihua and directly grabbed the key in her hand. “I bought the car too!”

“Zhou Cuihua was stunned at first. “Okay, here you go!” ”

“She had said that she wouldn’t take a needle from Li da long, so she wouldn’t take anything from him! ”

Zhou cuihua turned around and left.

The summer night was very lively.

“After walking out of that house, Zhou Cuihua felt her entire person had become much more relaxed. ”

“In the future, she was finally no longer that housewife who was nothing. ”

“She would be like Xia Xiaoman, living out her true self. ”

“Zhou cuihua originally wanted to return to her parents’house, but thinking that she still had to go to the Civil Affairs Bureau tomorrow morning, she did not return to her parents’house. Instead, she found a hotel to stay. ”

Although she didn’t take anything from Li Dalong.

But she still had some private money in the Li family all these years.

“At nine o’clock the next morning, Zhou Cuihua appeared in front of the Civil Affairs Bureau. ”

“When it was time for the appointment, Li Dalong arrived. ”

“Although it had already been a night, Li Dalong was still very angry. ”

How could he have imagined that Zhou cuihua would silently put on a hat for him.

“After going through the process, the two of them successfully obtained the divorce certificate. ”

Zhou cuihua was overjoyed and immediately called Li Hang to ask him out.

“”Hang Hang, look, what’s This?” ”

“Li Hang looked at the divorce certificate and frowned slightly. “Mom, you’re too impulsive!” ”

“”How am I impulsive! Your dad doesn’t have the ability, don’t tell me he won’t allow me to imitate Xia Xiaoman and find a capable stepfather for you?”Zhou cuihua was very confident in herself. ”

She believed that she would definitely marry better than Xia Xiaoman.

“Li hang continued, “Mom, this kind of opportunity doesn’t come often. Nowadays, it’s hard for many college students to find a financial backer, not to mention...”although Li Hang didn’t finish, what he said next was self-evident. ”

Zhou Cuihua had already reached her age.

It was impossible for her to find a millionaire at her age.

“”What About Me?”Zhou cuihua looked at li hang and said, “Don’t tell me that in your eyes, your mother can’t be compared to the half-aged Xia Xiaoman? “Let me tell you, I, Zhou Cuihua, can not only do what Xia Xiaoman can do, but I can do it even better!” ”

“At this point, Zhou cuihua continued, “Hurry up and move out from your father’s place.” ”Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com
