There was a moment of silence in the air.

“After a moment, Cen Shaoqing looked up at He ziteng and said slowly, “How are we going to chase him?” ”

Cen Shaoqing had been to the Middle East’s troubled region with his bare hands.

He had been shot.

“When he was eighteen, he had discussed the next 11-figure contract with an international giant face-to-face. ”

“In just 13 years, he had grown from a young man to a tycoon in the business world. He had firmly secured his position as the leader of the business world. What kind of storms had he not encountered? ”

“Hearing this, he ziteng was stunned for a moment and did not react for a moment. “What do you mean by how to pursue him?” ”

Cen Shaoqing enunciated each word clearly. “How to pursue ye Zhuo?”

“At this moment, he ziteng thought that he had heard wrongly. ”

Cen Shaoqing actually asked him a question!

Cen Shaoqing was an omnipotent image in his heart!

He did not expect that there was someone in this world that Cen Shaoqing did not know how to woo.

Even though he did not know how to woo.

He ziteng was 28 years old this year and was still single. He had zero combat experience.

Cen Shaoqing’s question really stumped him!

But —

“Fortunately, he was different from Cen Shaoqing. ”

“Cen Shaoqing liked to recite scriptures and Buddha in his free time, while he liked to surf the internet. In the online world, he had more or less accumulated some experience, “Fifth brother, you’ve finally asked the right person! Speaking of chasing girls, I have a lot of experience. As long as I make a move, I guarantee that you’ll catch up with my idol in no time...”. ”

“”Cut the crap,”Cen Shaoqing said lightly. ”

“He ziteng shut up and continued, “First of all, girls are a very strange creature. They often like to say the opposite. If you decide to chase my idol, you have to figure out my idol’s psychological activities.” ”

Cen Shaoqing frowned. “Give me an example.”

“He ziteng coughed lightly. “Brother Five, I’m a little thirsty.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing looked up at him, then stood up and went to get water for he ziteng. ”

“He ziteng said, “Fifth brother, I want to drink happy otaku water.” ”

Cen Shaoqing raised his eyebrows slightly.

“He ziteng was stunned, and a chill rose in his heart. He was really too arrogant. He actually dared to bargain with Cen Shaoqing! ”

“Immediately, he ziteng stood up and took the mineral water that Cen Shaoqing handed over. “Fifth brother, I’m joking with you! Actually, mineral water is very good! I really like drinking mineral water!” ”

“After saying that, he unscrewed the cap and gulped down two mouthfuls of water. He ziteng continued to impart his experience, “Brother Five, do you know what it means to say the right thing instead of the right thing? “For example, when the two of you were shopping, you saw a dress. If you asked her if she liked this dress, if she shook her head, then she would definitely like it! “At this time, if you immediately bought this dress, she would definitely be very happy ” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“”Because Oriental women are more shy, they are not good at expressing their true thoughts. Especially in front of the person they like, so at this time, you have to pay attention! In short, if she denies it, if she says she doesn’t like it in front of you, then she definitely likes it! So, you have to know how to cater to their thoughts!” ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

So the gap between girls and men was so Big?

“If she liked the right words, she would say the opposite... ”

“At this point, he ziteng continued, “Fifth brother, as long as you remember my words, you will definitely be able to woo my idol! At that time, my idol will become fifth sister-in-law!” ”

“When he heard the term ‘fifth sister-in-law’, the corners of Cen Shaoqing’s mouth curled up slightly. ”

This term was not bad.

He liked it very much.

“”Fifth brother, you can do it! I believe that you will definitely be able to woo my idol!” ”

Cen Shaoqing did not say a word.

“He ziteng continued, “Fifth brother, when do you decide to woo my idol? It’s better to choose the right time, or tomorrow! I think song Shiyu has already asked my idol out today. In the long run, if something happens to the two of them, it will be too late for you to regret it!” ”

Cen Shaoqing still didn’t say anything.

“Just as he ziteng thought Cen Shaoqing was going to refuse, Cen Shaoqing picked up the phone and dialed the internal line. “Hello, Special Assistant Zhou, cancel all my appointments for Tomorrow!” ”

Special Assistant Zhou on the other end of the phone was stunned.

“In Special Assistant Zhou’s eyes, Cen Shaoqing was a workaholic who never canceled his work carelessly. ”

Did the sun rise from the west today?

It was really too strange!

Special Assistant Zhou subconsciously turned his head to look out of the window.

“Not to mention Secretary Zhou, even he ziteng was stunned. ”

He also did not expect Cen Shaoqing to make a decision so quickly.

This was too decisive!

It seemed that Cen Shaoqing really loved ye Zhuo to death.
