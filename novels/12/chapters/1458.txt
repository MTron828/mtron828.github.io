It was also at this moment that Carl saw the reflection on the ground.

“Seeing that the wooden stick was about to fall on the back of his head, Carl dodged. ”

Bang!

It hit nothing!

“The person who ambushed Carl did not expect that Carl would notice him, nor did he expect that Carl would be so agile. ”

“Just as Carl turned to counterattack, the person who ambushed Carl suddenly got into the back seat of the taxi. ”

Whoosh —

“The car started the engine, and a cloud of dust rose in the air. The taillights disappeared into the night. ”

Carl narrowed his eyes. It seemed like he wasn’t hallucinating.

Someone had been watching him since he got off the plane.

Who were these people?

“Over the years, Carl had offended a lot of people on the street. For a moment, he couldn’t figure out who these people were. ”

Carl walked around downstairs for a few rounds before returning to the apartment. He activated the apartment’s security system and heaved a sigh of relief.

On the other side.

China.

Beijing.

“At eight o’clock in the evening, Lin Qingxuan and Xia Xiaoman returned to the villa. ”

“The maid, Auntie Sun, welcomed them. “Sir and Madam are back.” ”

“Auntie Sun.”Xia Xiaoman handed the coat in her hand to Auntie Sun.

“Auntie Sun took the coat and said with a smile, “It’s snowing outside. I made some ginger soup. Sir and Madam, please drink some ginger soup to drive out the cold.” ”

“”Auntie Sun, you’re Too Kind.”Xia Xiaoman looked at Auntie Sun. ”

“Auntie Sun came to work in the villa last year. Ever since she came to the villa, she worked seriously and didn’t talk much. Everyone in the Villa had a good impression of her. ”

“Sister-in-law sun smiled and said, “Madam, you must be joking. This is all part of my job.” ”

“After saying that, sister-in-law sun hung up her coat and continued, “Madam, drink the ginger soup while it’s hot. It Won’t have any effect if it’s cold.” ”

Xia Xiaoman nodded. She reached out to pick up the ginger soup and took a sip. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“When the warm ginger soup entered her mouth, she immediately felt her entire body warm up. ”

“After drinking the ginger soup, Xia Xiaoman turned to look at Lin Qingxuan. “You should drink it too.” ”

“Actually, Lin Qingxuan hated ginger a little. Usually, he would pick out the ginger from the stir-fried vegetables. ”

It was simply too difficult for him to drink ginger water.

“Lin qingxuan frowned and said, “This thing smells too bad. I Can’t drink it.” ”

“Xia Xiaoman smiled and said, “You’re already so old. Why are you afraid of drinking this?” ”

“Lin Qingxuan repeatedly rejected her. “My body is healthy, so I’m not afraid of any cold air entering my body.” ”

“Auntie sun continued, “Sir, good medicine tastes bitter. Drinking this ginger soup won’t do you any harm.” ”

“”Auntie Sun is right.”Xia Xiaoman nodded. “If you really can’t drink it, then pinch your nose.” ”

“Since Xia Xiaoman had already said so, Lin Qingxuan couldn’t refuse anymore. He pinched his nose and finished the entire bowl of ginger soup. ”

“After finishing the ginger soup, Auntie Sun took the bowl to the kitchen to wash it. ”

“Looking at Auntie Sun’s back, Xia Xiaoman turned to look at Lin Qingxuan. “How much is Auntie Sun’s salary now?” ”

“Lin Qingxuan said, “It seems to be 8,500 yuan.” ”

“The capital was not like other places. In the circle of aristocrats, the prices were high, and the wages were much higher than other places. ”

“Xia Xiaoman thought for a moment and then said, “Auntie Sun is so serious in her work and she’s a good person. Why Don’t we raise her salary to 10,000 yuan?” ”

“Sure.”Lin Qingxuan nodded. “I’ll listen to you. I’ll go talk to the butler in a while.”

“Auntie Sun took the bowls to the kitchen and washed them carefully. Then, she took them to the disinfection cabinet to sterilize them. ”

“After doing all this, Auntie Sun was ready to go home from work. ”

“The Butler walked over with a smile. “Auntie Sun, are you ready to go home?” ”

“Auntie Sun nodded. “Butler, do you still have something to do?” ”

“The butler continued, “Sir just came to look for me. He said that you have performed well recently and he wants to give you a raise.” ”

“AH? Really?”Auntie Sun said in surprise.

“The butler said, “Of course it’s true. Sir said that your salary will be increased from 8,500 to 10,000.” ”

“”Thank you, sir. Thank you, Butler.”Auntie Sun quickly bowed to express her gratitude. ”

“The butler smiled and said, “You’re welcome. You fought for this yourself.” ”

“Auntie sun said, “If there’s nothing else, I’ll go home first. My husband is still waiting for me to go back and Cook.” ”

“Go.”The housekeeper nodded.

Auntie Sun walked out.

It was snowing heavily outside.

“Half an hour later, Auntie Sun returned home. ”

“”You’re back.”Auntie Sun’s husband, Liu Fuhai, opened the door. He was still wearing an apron. ”

“Auntie sun said, “Have you already cooked?” ”

“Yes.”Sun Fuhai nodded. “Come in quickly. Let’s warm up and wash our hands. Then we can eat.”

Auntie Sun walked into the house and looked around. “Jiayi didn’t come back?”
