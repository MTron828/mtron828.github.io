“Chapter 1050: 232: Big Brother Ye, she is omnipotent! 6”

“Ye Zhuo was silent for a moment before he continued, “How many workers do we currently have under US that can be mobilized?” ”

“”About 300,”Cen Hai said. ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Then Let’s start tomorrow! Let’s do some preparations today.”

“Alright.”Cen Hai nodded.

Ye Zao stayed in the laboratory for the entire day and did not leave until around 7 pm.

Cen Jiang just happened to bump into Tang Xue who was walking out after sending ye Zao back. “Sister Xue.”

Tang Xue nodded. “Sending Miss Ye Off?”

“That’s right.”

“Tang Xue continued, “I saw that Miss ye stayed at the base for a day. Has your plan to develop an aircraft carrier already been implemented?” ”

“Speaking of this, Cen Jiang was extremely excited. “Today, I just did some preparatory work. Tomorrow, we’ll officially start work!” ”

“OH.”

“Cen Jiang continued, “Sister Xue, our research team is still lacking one person. Why don’t I Tell Miss Ye to let you come over?” ”

Cen Jiang had a good impression of Tang Xue.

Developing an aircraft carrier was not a small matter.

“Once the research was successful, it would be a national celebration. If Tang Xue joined the team, then even Tang Xue’s status at the base would rise along with it! ”

“Cen Jiang continued, “Miss ye said that not everyone can join our research team, but I have a good relationship with Miss Ye. As long as I tell her, she will definitely agree!” ”

“Hearing this, Tang Xue’s eyes were filled with speechlessness. ”

Not everyone could join Ye Zhuo’s research team?

This ye Zhuo really knew how to flatter himself! Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

It was obvious that everyone was avoiding him!

“Tang Xue smiled and said, “Cen Jiang, thank you for your kindness, but I’ve been quite busy recently. I still have a project to do, so I won’t join in the Fun!” ”

“”Ah! That’s such a pity!”Cen Jiang continued, “Sister Xue, let me tell you, I saw Miss Ye’s design today. Miss ye is really amazing! “I have a feeling that she will definitely be able to design an aircraft carrier that will amaze the world!” ”

An aircraft carrier that will amaze the world?

“Tang Xue’s face was full of sarcasm. At the same time, she sighed. Ye Zhuo’s brainwashing method was really brilliant. Not only did it make the four brothers, Jianghe, Huhai, and Tang Mi believe in her without a doubt, even Cen Shaoqing was fooled by her. ”

“Thinking that they would wake up sooner or later, Tang Xue’s heart was extremely happy! ”

“At that time, Ye Zhuo would definitely die a horrible death! ”

“Tang Xue looked at Cen Jiang, she said meaningfully, “Cen Jiang, from the moment you entered the base, I’ve watched you grow. Sister Xue, let me tell you something from the bottom of my heart. If you can quit, you’d better quit as soon as possible! Otherwise, you’ll get into trouble!” ”

“Cen Jiang was stunned. “Sister Xue, what do you mean?” ”

“Tang Xue continued, “Don’t tell me you really think that miss ye can develop an aircraft carrier?” ”

“You don’t believe Miss Ye?”Cen Jiang asked.

“Tang Xue didn’t answer Cen Jiang directly. Instead, she said, “Ask around in the base. How many people believe that Miss ye can develop an aircraft carrier?” ”

“Cen Jiang frowned slightly. “In any case, I believe that Miss ye can definitely do it!” ”

“Tang Xue smiled helplessly. “Cen Jiang, as a friend, I can only say this much. As for whether or not I will listen to you, that’s up to you!” ”

“After saying that, Tang Xue turned around and left. ”

“Cen Jiang looked at Tang Xue’s back and muttered softly, “It’s fine if you don’t want to come, but why are you slandering my goddess?” ”

Ye Zhuo went to the base for five consecutive days.

He left early and returned late every day.

“It was Saturday, and an Lizi and Zhao Pingting had invited her out to watch a movie. ”

“An lizi smiled and said, “Zao Zao, what have you been busy with these few days? I’ve gone home a few times, but you’re nowhere to be seen! Are you busy dating master five?” ”

Zhao Pingting looked at ye Zao with a gossipy expression.

Ye Zao took a sip of milk tea. “Cen Shaoqing went abroad on business. I have other things to do these few days.”

“What’s the matter?”Zhao Pingting was a little curious.

“Ye Zhuo looked up slightly. “You might not believe me if I tell you, but I’m developing an aircraft carrier.” ”

“Aircraft carrier? What aircraft carrier?”An Lizi was stunned.

Zhao Pingting’s face was also filled with question marks.

Ye Zhuo slowly spat out four words. “An aircraft carrier.”

“PFFT!”

An Lizi could not help but spit out the milk tea in her mouth. “Why didn’t you say that you’re developing Noah’s Ark!”

“Noah’s Ark?”Ye Zao rubbed his chin. “We can only consider it after the aircraft carrier is successfully developed.”

“Zhao Pingting took a tissue to wipe an Lizi’s mouth. “Zao Zao, we’re serious!” ”
