“”Zhou Xiang! Yinyin is your biological niece!”Xie wanqiu continued, “Is this how you treat your second aunt?” ”

“What About Me?”Zhou Xiang was confused. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Xie wanqiu pointed at Zhou Xiang’s nose and was so angry that she almost cursed. However, this was a public place after all.., “You really have the guts to ask Yinyin to apologize to ye Zao! It’s already a great thing that I didn’t ask ye Zao to apologize to yinyin! You actually asked Yinyin to apologize to ye Zao!” ”

“Zhou Xiang frowned. “Mom, you’re too unreasonable! This is clearly Wanyin’s fault!” ”

“Usually, Xie Wanqiu could bully her a little, but now that she was married and had a family, even if Xie Wanqiu wanted to bully her, her hands wouldn’t be able to stretch out that long. Besides, she was already used to it. ”

But Xie Wanqiu wanted to bully ye Zao?

Inverting black and white?

No.

Xie wanqiu clutched her chest. She was so angry that she almost couldn’t breathe.

“Zheng wanyin cried and said, “Grandma, please don’t be angry. Second aunt is right. This matter was my fault in the first place. It was my own fault for not being able to match up to her. I shouldn’t have doubted that there was a problem with the assessment. I’m sorry, I’m sorry...” ”

“Seeing Zheng Wanyin like this, Xie Wanqiu’s vision went dark. She fainted just like that. ”

She really fainted.

She was so angry.

“Zheng Wanyin was shocked. “Grandma! Grandma, Are You Alright? !” ”

Zhou Xiang did not expect Xie wanqiu to faint right away. “Mom!”

“”Second aunt, what should we do?” ”

“How would Zhou Xiang know what to do? She continued, “Let me try strangling her.” ”

“She pinched her hard, but Xie Wanqiu did not have any reaction. ”

“Zhou Xiang pinched again, but Xie wanqiu still did not have any reaction. ”

“Call 120.”Zhou Xiang turned to look at Zheng Wanyin.

“Zheng Wanyin nodded, took out her phone, and dialed 120 with trembling hands. ”

A moment later.

The sound of 120 ambulance was heard outside.

Zhou Xiang and Zheng Wanyin followed her to the hospital.

“After some first aid measures, Xie WANQIU finally woke up. ”

Zheng Wanyin was in the ward with Xie Wanqiu.

“Zhou Xiang went to the Doctor’s office. “Doctor Liu, how’s My Mother’s condition?” ”

“Doctor Liu smiled and said, “Don’t worry. The old lady’s condition is very good. It’s just that she’s short of breath, which caused her to fall into a temporary coma.” ”

“Are there any sequelae?”Zhou Xiang was a little worried.

“Doctor Liu shook his head. “Don’t worry, there aren’t any. If the old lady’s physical condition is bad, there will definitely be sequelae. However, the old lady’s various indicators are very good. There won’t be any sequelae.” ”

“Zhou Xiang heaved a sigh of relief. “Then, then do we still need to stay in the hospital?” ”

“”There’s no need to stay in the hospital,”doctor Liu continued. “However, if you’re worried, you can stay in the hospital for half a day. You can go back tomorrow.” ”

“”Okay, thank you, doctor Liu.”Zhou Xiang bowed and thanked Doctor Liu. ”

“”Mrs. Cen, you’re too polite.” ”

“Having been in the industry for so many years, Zhou Xiang was the most unassuming wealthy lady that doctor Liu had ever met. ”

She was one of a kind.

“If not for her colleagues telling him about it, she would have thought that Zhou Xiang was just an ordinary wealthy family. ”

On the other side.

In the ward.

“Zheng wanyin cried, “Grandma, do you know that you scared me to death just now!” ”

“Xie wanqiu patted Zheng Wanyin’s head. “Silly child, what’s there to be scared about! Grandma is fine. Oh right, where’s that B * Tch Zhou Xiang?” ”

“Zheng Wanyin sniffled. “Grandma, don’t talk about second aunt like that. She actually cares about you a lot too.” ”

“Cares about me? I think she can’t Wait for me to Die! She doesn’t know what’s good for her. It’s better to raise a dog than her!”Xie Wanqiu was really angry.

Back when she came to the Zhou family.

How Old was Zhou Xiang?

13 years old.

A 13-year-old child didn’t know anything. Zhou Xiang would do whatever she asked Zhou Xiang to do.

“She told Zhou Xiang to go east, but Zhou Xiang would never dare to go west. ”

She thought that she could hold Zhou Xiang in her hands for the rest of her life.

Who would have thought.

Zhou Xiang would be chosen by the CEN family by accident.

“In fact, Xie Wanqiu originally wanted to marry Zheng Wanyin’s mother to the Cen family. ”

Zhou Xiang was shameless.

She must have deliberately seduced Cen Haifeng!

The appearance of the Cen family made Zhou Xiang’s fate turn around.

The poor girl became the rich lady that everyone envied.

“Later on, the CEN family directly became the number one family in China. ”

“Seeing Zhou Xiang’s status getting higher and higher day by day, Zheng Wanyin’s mother became anxious and gradually fell into depression. She was so angry that she died. ”

“After Zheng Wanyin’s mother died, Xie Wanqiu saw that Zheng Wanyin was really too pitiful alone, so she carried Zheng Wanyin over and raised her. ”
