“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“After saying that, old Mrs. Cen looked at the servant next to her and continued, “Go to the kitchen and tell the head chef to add more dishes. There will be guests coming in a while.” ”

“”Okay, old Mrs. Cen.” ”

“Soon, the servant brought Old Mrs. Zuo and Mrs. Zuo in. ”

“The Zuo family’s old lady looked about the same age as the Cen family’s old lady, while Madam Zuo was relatively much younger. ”

Beside the two of them stood a very cute child in a suit.

“”Elder sister, we haven’t seen each other for many years.”Old Lady Zuo walked over quickly and held Old Lady Cen’s hand with both hands, her eyes slightly red. ”

“Seeing her old friend again, Old Lady Cen was very excited. “I thought you would never come back in this lifetime! It’s like a Dream!” ”

“”The capital is where I was born and raised. How could I not come back!”Although she had lived abroad for many years, old Mrs. Zuo’s family were all Chinese nationals. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen held old Mrs. Zuo’s hand tightly and said in a raspy voice, “It’s good that you’re back. It’s good that you’re back.” ”

“The two sisters talked for a while before Mrs. Zuo greeted her from behind. “Aunt Tang, long time no see.” ”

“Madam Zuo was Old Madam Zuo’s daughter-in-law, and her name was Sun Fanghua. ”

“Old Madam Cen looked at Sun Chuanghua and smiled. “Fanghua has changed! If I met her on the street, how would I be able to recognize her!”Although she was already 45 years old, Sun Fanghua took good care of herself and did not notice her actual age at all. ”

“Sun Fanghua looked at old madam Cen and said, “You have also changed.” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen nodded. “Yes, I have changed. I have become old.” ”

“”No, you are not old at all.”Sun fanghua smiled and said, “You are getting younger and younger as you live!” ”

“This wasn’t any flattery. Although Old Mrs. Cen was old, she was still very energetic. ”

Her hair was white and her face was young.

“Old Mrs. Cen said, “She is almost 90 years old. If she isn’t old, she will become a demon. By the way, let me introduce you. This is my future granddaughter-in-law, Ye Zao.” ”

“After saying that, old Mrs. Cen looked at ye Zao and said, “Come, Ye. This is your Grandma Zuo, and this is Auntie Sun.” ”

“Ye Zao greeted politely, “Grandma Zuo, Auntie Sun.” ”

“Looking at Ye Zao, Old Mrs. Zuo and Sun Fanghua’s eyes were filled with shock. ”

“Before this, Old Mrs. Cen had once sent a photo of ye Zao to Old Mrs. Zuo. ” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The Ye Zao in the photo was already very beautiful. It was so beautiful that it could topple countries and cities. It was so beautiful that it did not seem like it was from this world.

“At that time, Mrs. Zuo had even joked that beauty techniques were too powerful now. Old Lady Cen was also someone who cared about her face. She always wanted to be first in everything and wanted to surpass Zuo Feng. ”

Zuo Feng was the only grandson of Old Lady Zuo and also the son of Mrs. Zuo.

“Therefore, this was definitely photoshopped. Who would be so beautiful. ”

Who would have thought...

“Who would have thought that after seeing her in person, she would actually be more beautiful than her photos. ”

“It was always the photos that were more beautiful than people, but when it came to Ye Zhuo, it was actually people who were more outstanding than the photos! ”

This was too unbelievable!

“”This, this is Shaoqing’s girlfriend?”After a long while, Old Lady Zuo finally reacted and asked. ”

“”Yes.”Old Lady Cen said, “How is it? My future granddaughter-in-law is not bad, right?” ”

Old Lady Zuo nodded repeatedly. “Beautiful. She’s really too beautiful!”

“Hearing this, Old Lady Cen’s face was full of arrogance. If she had a tail, it would definitely be up in the sky by now. “That’s right! I personally chose my granddaughter-in-law. How can she not be beautiful?” ”

“Old Mrs. Zuo did not want to lose to old Mrs. Cen like this. She pulled up the child beside her and said, “Quick, call her great-grandmother.” ”

Great-grandmother?

Old Mrs. Cen was stunned.

“Old Mrs. Zuo smiled and said, “Elder sister, I forgot to tell you. This is Xiao Feng’s child, which is also my great-grandson.” ”

Great-grandson!

Old Mrs. Cen was stunned.

“Her great-grandson was still a dog, but her good sister already had a great-grandson who knew how to play along! ”

Comparing real people was infuriating.

“The child was about three or four years old. He looked at Old Lady Zuo with a confused expression and said, “Aren’t you my only great-grandmother?” ”

“Old Lady Zuo said, “Great-grandmother and this great-grandmother are the best sisters, so she is also your great-grandmother.” ”

“Old Lady Cen gulped and continued, “That’s not right! When did your Xiao Feng have a son? Why didn’t I know?” ”

“Old Lady Zuo smiled and said, “Isn’t this to give you a surprise?” ”

What a big surprise!
