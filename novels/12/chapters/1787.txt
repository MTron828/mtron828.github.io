“Why would a woman want a divorce? Of course, it was because her family life was not happy. ”

“As long as Wang Qiong and Xu Zhizhi talked more about the disadvantages of marriage in front of Xu Chaonan and combined with Xu Chaonan’s previous relationship experience, she would definitely not think about marriage anymore. ”

“Thinking of this, the corners of mother Xu’s lips curled up. ”

“Xu Xiao continued, “Mom, if you have nothing else to do, I’ll go up First!” ”

“You go ahead.”Mother Xu nodded.

“When she walked up the spiral staircase, Xu Xiao looked back at her mother. She always felt that the manicurist was a little strange, but she could not tell what was strange. “Mom, let me know when your nails are done.” ”

“What do you want to Do?”asked Xu Xiao’s mother.

“”I want to do my nails too,”said Xu Xiao. ”

“”It’s better not to! Your Aunt hates little girls doing their nails the most.”Xu Chaonan might have been a leader for a long time. Sometimes, even his sister-in-law lectured him without mercy. ”

Xu Xiao pursed her lips and was a little dissatisfied.

It was so annoying!

“A 20-year-old girl was at the age where she loved to look beautiful, but Xu Chaonan did not allow it. It was as if he had reached menopause. ”

...

On the other side.

Beijing University.

Ye Zao came to the dormitory.

Li Yueyue was putting on makeup in front of the mirror.

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Yueyue, when did you learn how to put on makeup?”Before this, Li Yueyue had only put on water cream. She did not even have a lipstick. ”

“Now, on the makeup table, there was foundation fluid, powder, blush, eye shadow, false eyelashes, and everything else. ”

“”I learned it from the beauty makeup blogger!”Li Yueyue said, “I didn’t expect makeup to be so fun! Zao Zao, sit over here. I’ll rub off your makeup too.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zao sat over.

“Ye Zao’s skin was very white. If one looked closer, one couldn’t even see his pores. ”

It was as white as jade.

“In the past, when Li Yueyue did not learn how to do makeup, she did not think much of it. Now, when she looked at ye Zao’s face, she only felt that it was amazing. ”

“With such a good foundation, it would be very easy for her to put on makeup. ”

She did not have to worry about the problem of the powder or the powder. It was simply the favorite of makeup artists!

“Li yueyue sighed, “When my skin can be half as good as yours, I will be satisfied!” ”

“Ye Zao said, “Your skin is also pretty good.”Li Yueyue’s facial features were exquisite, and her eyes were big. It was different from the rough and wild grassland style in her impression. She was the kind of sweet and cute wind. ”

“”What’s so good about it!”Li yueyue frowned and said, “Not only are my pores big, they’re also dry. The makeup card powder was stuck! I apply a mask almost every day, but it’s still the same!” ”

“Ye Zao said, “You can’t apply a hydrating face mask every day. It’s best to apply it twice a week.” ”

“Is that so?”Li Yueyue asked.

“”Of course.”Ye Zao nodded slightly. “When things reach their extreme, they will reverse.” ”

“I see.”Li Yueyue picked up the sunscreen and smeared it on ye Zao’s face. “Then I will apply a face mask twice a week from now on.”

“Okay.”

Ye Zao’s foundation was very good. There was no need to apply isolation. He only needed to apply a layer of sunscreen and isolation.

“Li Yueyue habitually picked up the fake eyelashes and wanted to stick them on ye Zao. However, when she saw ye Zao’s eyelashes, she was completely dumbfounded! ”

“Ye Zao’s eyelashes were like a small, thick fan. Under the thick eyelashes, there was a pair of eyes as clear as lake water. They were sparkling and could inadvertently seduce one’s soul. ”

“Although Li Yueyue’s eyelashes were not short, she still needed to wear fake eyelashes. Ye Zao was simply an eyelash essence! ”

His eyelashes were so long that it made people jealous!

It was really infuriating to compare people.

How could someone be so beautiful?

“Li Yueyue put down her eyelashes, picked up her lipstick, and bent down to apply it on Ye Zao. ” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Ye Zao’s lips were crimson red, so Li Yueyue chose a vintage red one. ”

“Vintage Red was the kind of red color. The color of the skin was slightly darker and could not be suppressed at all. However, when it was applied on ye Zao’s lips, the red color seemed to pale in comparison. ”

“Ye Zhuo looked at himself in the mirror for a while and then said, “By the way, yueyue, how did your conversation with Brother Wei Go? Is there any possibility for it to develop?” ”

“”To be honest, it didn’t go well!”Li Yueyue shook her head. ”

“Why do you say that?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“”I feel that his personality is a little incompatible.”Li Yueyue continued, “He would send me three messages every day. He would ask me if I woke up in the morning, ask me if I had lunch, ask me when I went to bed at night, and even tell me that it’s not good for a girl to stay up late, and that it will cause wrinkles! “I invited him to play King, and he said that he wanted to write a thesis! “He also told me that I can’t be addicted to online games, and that this will affect the IQ of future children! “I said that my stomach hurts, and he told me to drink more hot water... “... “...” ”
