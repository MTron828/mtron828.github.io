Translator: 549690339

A car accident?

Zhou Cuihua?

How was that possible!

She had just met Zhou Cuihua yesterday.

There was a mistake!

There must be a mistake!

“Li hang continued, “You must have made a mistake!” ”

“Are You Li Hang?”The policeman on the other end asked.

“”Yes,”Li Hang replied. ”

“Then is your mother called Zhou Cuihua?”The policeman continued to ask.

“Yes.”

“That’s right.”The police officer sounded a little anxious. “Your mother’s condition is very serious now. You should come over quickly.”

Zhou Cuihua was hit by the cement tanker when she was crossing the road. She was unconscious on the spot.

The cement tanker driver died on the spot in order to avoid Zhou cuihua.

“Li Hang’s expression was unclear. He continued, “My mother... my mother...” ”

Why did fate have to go against her.

He had hoped that Zhou cuihua would be able to find Li Dalong and let her return to her previous life.

“But now, Zhou Cuihua was gone... ”

Then what about her?

What should she do?

“The police officer could understand Li Hang’s current mood very well. He continued, “Little girl, don’t be anxious. I’ll send you the specific address after I hang up the phone. Hurry over after you pack up.” ”

“Okay.”Li hang hung up the phone.

“Not long after, Li Hang received a text message. ”

It was the specific address of the hospital.

“At this moment, Li Hang really wanted to cry, but she could not cry. This was the company. ”

“Even if she wanted to leave, she had to leave in a dignified manner. She could not let others see her as a joke. ”

Li Hang tried his best to calm himself down. He took his things and walked out.

“Soon, Li Hang arrived at the entrance of the group. ”

“He first went to the dormitory, then to the hospital. ”

“After standing there for a while, Li Hang confirmed the route. ”

“There was no one in the dormitory, so Li Hang packed his things. ”

She never thought that she would move out today after moving into the dormitory yesterday. She never thought that something would happen to Zhou cuihua.

What should she do?

What should she do now!

An Lizi!

All of this was an Lizi’s and her mother’s fault!

“If it wasn’t for them, Zhou Cuihua wouldn’t have divorced Li Dalong for no reason! ”

“If it wasn’t for them, Zhou Cuihua wouldn’t have spent all her private money on the detective agency. ”

B * Tch!

An Lizi and her mother were B * tches.

“”Die a horrible death!”Li Hang picked up the vase on the table and smashed it on the ground. “An Lizi, you will get your retribution!” ”

“After a long time, Li Hang walked out of the dormitory with his suitcase. ”

The sunset dragged her back.

Li Hang got on the bullet train to Jiangde Province.

“Five hours later, Li Hang appeared at the city hospital in Wuling City, Jiangde Province. ”

“As soon as he got off the train, the police called him. ”

“”Little girl, have you arrived?” ”

“”I just arrived at the high-speed railway station,”Li Hang answered. ”

“The police continued, “Alright, I’ll wait for you at the hospital entrance.” ”

“Okay.”

“It was Li Hang’s first time in Wuling City, so he was very unfamiliar with everything here. After going around in circles for nearly two hours, he finally arrived at the hospital entrance. ”

“After getting out of the car, she called the police. ”

“”Hello, officer Li, I’m here.” ”

“Officer Li held his phone and looked for Li Hang’s figure in the crowd. “Little girl, are you wearing a blue dress?” ”

“”I am,”Li Hang said. ”

“Officer Li put down his phone and jogged over to Li Hang. “Little girl, Are You Li Hang?” ”

“I am.”

Officer Li Looked Li hang up and down.

The little girl was about twenty-three or twenty-four years old. Her eyes were very swollen. She should have just cried.

“”Little girl, are you the only one here? Where’s the rest of your family? Where’s your father?” ”

Li hang looked at officer Li. “My parents got divorced.”

My parents got divorced and my mother got into an accident.

It was really too tragic!

“Officer Li Sighed. “I’m sorry, please come in with me quickly. First, go and see your mother. Then, I’ll tell you about what happened. You can follow me back to the police station to make a backup.” ”

“Okay.”Li hang nodded.

“Soon, Li Hang came to the ICU in a bacteria-proof suit. ” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“The attending doctor introduced to Li hang, “The patient has a comminuted fracture all over her body and intracranial bleeding. The current situation is not optimistic. You have to be mentally prepared. She may lose her heartbeat at any time.” ”

Zhou Cuihua was lying on the hospital bed with tubes inserted all over her body. Her vital signs could no longer be seen.

“Even though Li hang usually looked down on this mother, when he saw Zhou cuihua lying on the hospital bed like this, his eyes turned red and he could not help but burst into tears. ”
