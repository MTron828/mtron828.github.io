Chapter 2233: 468: the icing on the cake! 1

Translator: 549690339

Personally promoting a marriage was a good thing.

Bai Mo looked at Bai Jingshu not far away and smiled.

“Bai Yuanyuan continued, “Mo Mo, why do I not understand what you’re saying?” ”

“You don’t need to understand.”Bai Mo turned around and looked at Bai Yuanyuan. “Who is the person who is chasing after Bai Jingshu?”

“”It’s Du Yaosheng, the younger brother of the head of the Du family,”Bai Yuanyuan replied. ”

“”The du family is a truly prestigious family. If my cousin could marry into the du family, it would be her fortune.” ”

“Bai Yuanyuan continued, “I don’t know what kind of dumb luck Bai Jingshu has. Manwen seems to be interested in her. Du Yaosheng is even more infatuated with her. He fell head over heels for her.” ”

“Du Yaosheng was not some good-for-nothing. Although he was not as outstanding as the head of the Du family, he was definitely one of the best among the children of the rich and powerful. ”

Even Bai Yuanyuan might not be able to marry a man like du Yaosheng in the future.

How could Bai Yuanyuan be convinced by this.

“Other than her looks, what else could Bai Jingshu be like? ”

Oh.

Bai Jingshu also knew how to write a few big words to make people happy.

“However, Bai Jingshu knew nothing about technology. She only knew how to study backward historical ideas in her notebook all day long. ”

“At this point, Bai Yuanyuan sighed, “It seems like what my mother said is true. Girls are really like canola seeds. It’s useless to be outstanding. We need to find a good place to grow roots and sprouts. Only then can we grow stronger and stronger in the future.” ”

“To put it simply, a girl could not be outstanding, but she had to marry an outstanding man. ”

Bai Mo also agreed with this view. “It’s not enough. It’s important to be outstanding.”

A truly outstanding man would not fall for a tacky woman.

“”Bai Jingshu is only lucky for the time being,”Bai Mo continued, “She has no inner self. Even if she really gets together with Manwen in the future, she will only be abandoned.” ”

“The beauty of a ruler was in decline, but love was in decline. The virtue of a ruler was in the long run. ”

“Hearing this, Bai Yuanyuan felt much better. ”

“Someone like Bai Jingshu, who was only beautiful on the outside, would be abandoned sooner or later. ”

“Bai Mo raised his hand to tidy up his hair and said, “Let’s go over there.” ”

“Where are we going?”Bai Yuanyuan was stunned.

Bai Mo smiled gently. “Let’s go and say hello to cousin.”

“OH.”Bai Yuanyuan immediately followed Bai Mo’s footsteps.

The two of them came to Bai Jingshu’s side.

“Bai Jingshu lived up to her name. She was quiet and didn’t have many twists and turns. She knew that she wasn’t the same as Bai Mo and Bai Yuanyuan, so she didn’t have much interaction with the two of them. ”

“They rarely met each other, and even if they did, they would only nod at most. ”

“But today, Bai Mo actually changed his usual behavior and walked up to greet her warmly. “Sister.” ”

“He called her ‘sister’very warmly. If people didn’t know about it, they would think that Bai Mo was Bai Jingshu’s biological sister. ”

“”Momo, Yuanyuan,”Bai Jingshu greeted politely as well. ”

“Bai Yuanyuan had always been a person who would talk to anyone she met. Even if she did not like Bai Jingshu in her heart, she would not show it. ”

“”Sister Jingshu, it’s been a long time since we last met. You’ve become more beautiful again.” ”

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “Thank you, but you’re even more beautiful.” ” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Bai Mo walked forward and held Bai Jingshu’s arm.

Bai Jingshu was stunned. She furrowed her brows without anyone noticing. She subconsciously felt that Bai Mo was a little abnormal today.

“She had a clear view of herself and knew that her interests and preferences were different from those of ordinary people. As a result, the sisters in her family were more or less displeased with her. ”

“Because of this, her parents had talked to her many times. ”

“However, she could not change the affection in her bones. ”

“Her parents had spoken and criticized her. As time passed, when they saw that she could not change it, they let her be. ”

“When children grew up, it was not up to their parents. ”

“Fortunately, Bai Jingshu was a girl. No matter what a girl did, she could still get married in the future. She was not like a boy. If she did not learn well, it would be difficult for her to get married and have children in the future. ”

It could also be understood as Bai Jingshu being abandoned by her parents.

“In large families, only boys were specially nurtured. ”

Girls were the foil to the icing on the cake.

It was better than nothing.

“Since Bai Mo and Bai Yuanyuan were acting so strangely today, there must be something else going on. ”

There must be something fishy going on.

Bai Jingshu maintained her smile and kept her composure.

“Bai Yuanyuan smiled and said, “How can I compete with you, Sister Jingshu?” ”

“As they spoke, Bai Yuanyuan and Bai Mo looked at each other and said, “Sister Jingshu, I heard that the second young master of the Du family is chasing you, right?” ”
