“It was clearly a very simple action, but it inadvertently emitted a noble and cold aura, making people somewhat afraid to look directly at it. ”

“Feng Xianxian looked at Cen Shaoqing, a look of infatuation appearing in her eyes. ”

“When she thought about how she would be CEN fifth master’s Pillow Person in the future, Feng Xianxian could not help but feel a surge of emotions. ”

Fifth Master Cen.

It was hers!

No one could take it away from her.

Lin Jincheng brought ye Shu and ye Zhuo to get to know everyone in the banquet hall before returning to the main table.

“At this moment, a middle-aged couple who seemed to be very loving walked over. ”

“This was the fourth son of the Lin family, Lin Qingxuan, and his wife, Zhao shuning. ”

“Zhao shuning was a relative of Old Lady Lin’s family, so she especially favored this fourth daughter-in-law. ”

“Lin Qingxuan and Zhao shuning had lived abroad for many years, so they didn’t expect to suddenly appear at the banquet today. ”

“Seeing Lin Qingxuan and Zhao shuning appear on time, Feng Qianhua heaved a sigh of relief. ”

“”Mom!”Seeing Old Lady Lin, Zhao shuning hugged her excitedly. ”

“Perhaps because they had lived abroad for many years, Zhao shuning and Lin Qingxuan both spoke English. ”

“Old Lady Lin smiled and said, “Qingxuan, shuning, I thought you guys wouldn’t come back! I didn’t expect you guys to actually come back!” ”

“Zhao shuning said, “Our family is celebrating the import of an additional child. How Can Qingxuan and I not come back? Oh right, which one of you is the fifth sister-in-law and eldest niece?” ”

“At the mention of this topic, a hint of unhappiness appeared in Old Lady Lin’s eyes, but she couldn’t show it in front of everyone. ”

“Lin Jincheng continued, “Fourth brother, fourth sister-in-law, this is Ye Shu, and this is my daughter, Ye Zao.” ”

Zhao shuning turned around to look.

The mother and daughter were rather good-looking.

It was a pity.

Their birth was a little bad.

It was said that ye Shu had not even graduated from middle school.

As for ye Zao...

He was a complete idiot.

“Although Zhao Shuning lived abroad all year round, because of Feng Qianhua and old Madam Lin, she had a clear understanding of the Lin family’s affairs. ”

“Like Old Lady Lin, she felt that Feng Qianhua was the most suitable person for Lin Jincheng. ”

“No matter what, Feng Qianhua came from a prestigious family. If she followed Lin Jincheng out, at least she wouldn’t embarrass the Lin family. ”

“Moreover, Feng Qianhua had waited for Lin Jincheng for nineteen years. ”

The two of them were a perfect match.

“As far as she knew, if it weren’t for Ye Shu’s sudden appearance, Feng Qianhua would have already married Lin Jincheng. ”

“In Zhao Shuning’s eyes, Ye Shu’s actions were no different from a mistress! ”

She was a mistress.

“Not only did she snatch Lin Jincheng away nineteen years ago, but she also snatched Lin Jincheng away from Feng Qianhua nineteen years later. ”

She was too shameless!

“Therefore, after hearing about this matter, Zhao shuning immediately rushed back from abroad to support Feng Qianhua and her daughter. ”

Lin Qingxuan couldn’t make the decision at home. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“And because she couldn’t have children, she always felt sorry for Zhao shuning. Therefore, Zhao shuning made all the decisions at home. ”

“Zhao shuning smiled and said, “So this is fifth sister-in-law and niece! Hello, fifth sister-in-law, I’m Zhao shuning. We will be a family in the future. Please take care of me.” ”

“Ever since she came back, Zhao shuning had been speaking in English. ”

She was doing this to embarrass ye Shu.

A person who couldn’t even speak English had no right to enter the Lin family.

Feng Qianhua had been waiting for this moment for a long time.

No one knew ye Shu better than she did.

“After Ye Shu finished her second year of junior high, she didn’t continue to study. All these years, she had been working as a waitress at a food stall. Now, although she was wearing a gorgeous gown and standing in front of Lin Jincheng, she still couldn’t change, deep down, she was a lowly person! ”

The dignified matriarch of the Lin family couldn’t even speak English!

“If this were to spread, she would definitely be ridiculed! ”

“After Zhao Shuning finished speaking, the air became somewhat quiet. ”

Everyone was waiting for Ye Shu’s answer.

“Although ye Zhuo had already proven his strength, this could only prove herself at most. ”

Zhao shuning’s arrival reminded everyone that ye Shu was someone who hadn’t even finished junior high school.

English was the universal language.

“If ye Shu couldn’t even speak English, then she really didn’t have the right to hold on to the position of the matriarch of the Lin family. ”

“Old Madam Lin looked at ye Shu like that, and her eyes were almost spitting fire! ”

Embarrassing!

Too embarrassing!

“She couldn’t even speak English, yet she had the nerve to seduce Lin Jincheng and dream of becoming the matriarch of the Lin family! ”

She didn’t even consider how much she weighed.

“When Lin Jincheng and ye Shu met, Ye Shu didn’t know English at all. Hearing Zhao Shuning’s words, Lin Jincheng said, “Fourth sister-in-law, you’ve already returned to the country. Shouldn’t you speak our mother tongue?” ”
