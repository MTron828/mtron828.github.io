Translator: 549690339

It was especially pleasant to hear.

“Ye Zhuo looked up at him and said in a clear and shallow tone, “I want to discuss something with you.” ”

Cen Shaoqing lowered his eyes slightly and the corners of his mouth curled up. “Just inform the leader directly if there’s anything.”

“Ye Zhuo did not want to quibble with him, he smiled and said, “Yueyue just came over to look for me. She said that on the grasslands, it’s always the 28th of the twelfth lunar month before the New Year. She suggested that we stay and wait until the 29th of the new year before leaving. Is there any problem on your side? “If there is no problem, I want to stay on the grassland and wait until the New Year.” ”

“”No problem,”Cen Shaoqing said. “Leader, you can decide on such a small matter.” ”

“Really?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly.

“”Really, there is no problem,”Cen Shaoqing said. “The new year on the grassland should be very lively.”He was not a person who liked to join in the fun. People who liked Buddhism liked peace and quiet. Ever since he was with Ye Zhuo.., he had forgotten how to write the word peace and quiet. ”

This kind of experience was very wonderful.

He had experienced all the things that he thought he would never experience before.

“Although his face hurt a little, he was really satisfied. ”

“Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Yes, Yueyue said the same thing. So it’s settled then?” ”

“Yes.”

“Ye Zao continued, “I’ll Call My mom and tell them.” ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “I’ll let Grandma Know later.”

Time passed by a little too quickly.

“In the blink of an eye, two days had passed. ”

“During these two days, Li Sanzhu and Fang Yueyin had not made a single move. This made Li Shuyi a little anxious. She walked to her mother’s bedroom and said, “Mom, didn’t you say that they would definitely come to look for you within three days?” ”

“Linda was busy putting on her face mask. When she heard this, she looked at Li Shuyi and said, “I said three days. How many days is it now? Why are you in such a hurry?” ”

“But it’s already been two days.”Linda frowned. “What if they don’t Come?”

“”They won’t not come.”Linda narrowed her eyes. “Tomorrow, they will definitely come tomorrow.” ”

She understood the nature of the Chinese people too well.

They were extremely greedy.

Many people had gone to great lengths to obtain the nationality of C Nation. How could Li Sanzhu and Fang Yueyin let go of this opportunity for nothing?

This was a great thing that could reach the sky in one step.

“”Mom, are you sure that they will really come tomorrow?”Li Shuyi asked in disbelief. ”

“Yes.”Linda nodded with great confidence.

“Li Sanzhu and Fang Yueyin were real bumpkins. They were born in humble circumstances. Now that an opportunity to change their fates was right in front of them, how could these two let it go? ”

“After saying that, Linda looked at Li Shuyi and said unhurriedly, “How many times have I told you to be calm when you encounter things? Don’t be like your father, like a country bumpkin from the countryside! You don’t have the slightest bit of knowledge!” ”

“Although Linda liked Li Erzhu very much, it was true that she did not like Li Erzhu from the bottom of her heart. ”

But who asked her to love Li Erzhu?

True love could surpass all obstacles.

Regardless of height or status.

Li Shuyi nodded. “Got it.”

Her mother was right. Perhaps this was a trap set up by Li Erzhu and Fang Yueyin.

They must not fall for it!

“After a while, Linda turned to look at Li Shuyi and continued, “Right, if they come to see me tomorrow, you can say that I’m not here.” ”

“Why?”Li Shuyi did not understand Linda’s intention.

“Linda smiled and continued, “Don’t they like to keep people in suspense? Then let them keep it up!” ” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“She had to make Li Sanzhu and Fang Yueyin, this disgusting couple, behave! ”

“Otherwise, she wouldn’t have come from the Jones family! ”

“Thinking of this, the corners of Linda’s lips curled up. ”

“Li Shuyi instantly understood her mother’s intentions and continued, “Alright, I got it.” ”

Linda nodded.

“Li Shuyi continued, “Mom, I’ll go out first.” ”

“Go Out.”Linda waved her hand.

Li Shuyi went outside.

“Ai Ru walked over and asked, “How is it?” ”

“”Don’t worry, My mom knows what she’s doing.”Li Shuyi said, “My mom said that they will definitely come looking for me personally tomorrow! However, my mom will definitely not agree so easily.” ”

“Ai Ru said, “That’s good.” ”

“At this moment, a servant came over and said, “Miss. .” ”

“What’s the matter?”Li Shuyi asked.

“The servant continued, “Third mistress is here. She said that she has something to ask Madam.” ”

Third Mistress?

Fang Yueyin!

“Hearing this, Li Shuyi’s eyes lit up. A moment ago, she had been worried that Fang Yueyin would not come and beg them. She had not expected that Fang Yueyin would come so quickly. ”
