“Master five seemed to be supporting ye Zhuo, but in fact, he was supporting the entire Shunxi Financial Group. ”

“After all, she was now the acting chief of the Shunxi Financial Group. ”

“Otherwise, master five wouldn’t have sent gifts to Ye Zhuo for no reason. ”

“It must be known that before this, DK Financial Group and Shunxi Financial Group didn’t have any contact. ”

Not to mention Shunxi.

DK was ranked first in the global financial ranking.

It was always others who tried to curry favor with DK. When had DK ever tried to curry favor with any other financial group?

Shunxi was the first!

“At the International Financial Conference two months ago, Zhao Xueyin knew that master five would attend the conference, so she made ample preparations. ”

She was several streets ahead of the other foreign participants.

She became the only Chinese woman among the top five participants.

She was unique.

It would be difficult for master five not to notice her.

It also corresponded to that saying.

“If you bloom, the butterfly will come. ”

So...

Master five had fallen in love with her?

“Otherwise, master five wouldn’t have lowered his status and sent Li Ruo to deliver the gift. ”

“Other than that, there was no other reasonable explanation. ”

“The more Zhao Xueyin thought about it, the more excited she became. Her heart was about to jump out of her chest. ”

Bang Bang Bang —

One after another.

Zhao Xueyin had never felt this kind of feeling before. It was as if she could touch the fifth master as long as she stretched out her hand.

“Close, very close. ”

It turned out that the distance between her and the fifth master had unknowingly become so close.

“Although she was very excited, Zhao Xueyin still tried very hard to control herself. ”

Steady.

She had to steady herself now.

Master five was not a simple person.

This was just the beginning.

She had to make master five marry someone else.

“Since master five had already seen her now, she had the ability to make master five marry someone else. ”

“Zhao Xueyin’s beautiful eyes narrowed, and her eyes were full of determination. ”

“Hearing Li Ruo say that master five had prepared a gift for ye Zhuo, the surrounding people discussed animatedly. ”

“Oh my God! Don’t Tell Me Miss Ye and master five know each other?”

“A hero can not overcome a beauty. is master five courting Miss Ye?”

“Holy shit! It Can’t be!”

“”Think about it carefully. Did Shunxi Financial Group and DK Financial Group have any relationship in the past? Once Miss Ye returned, master five eagerly asked Vice Chief Li Ruo to bring a gift over. Isn’t it obvious?” ”

“What you said seems to make sense.”

“You guys are too good at imagining things! What if they’re just ordinary friends?”

Master five wooed ye Zhuo?

“Hearing this, Zhao Xueyin’s eyes were filled with mockery. ”

It was so funny!

Did Ye Zhuo really think he was something?

Would master five take a fancy to someone like her?

It was simply a fantasy!

But this was also good.

“Now everyone had misunderstood that master five was pursuing ye Zao and was interested in ye Zao. When the truth was revealed, they would see how ye Zao would still have the face to establish himself in the financial world! ”

“At that time, she would be the first lady of the financial world. ”

What was ye Zao?

He was a rat that everyone wanted to beat!

“Thinking of this, Zhao Xueyin’s face was full of joy. ”

“At this moment, two strong men carried a box covered with a red cloth and walked inside. ”

Li Ruo looked back slightly. “This is the gift that fifth master prepared for Miss Ye.” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“When she said this, everyone discussed animatedly. ”

“This gift looks so special.”

“Guess what’s inside?”

“Could it be a thousand roses?”

“”1,000 roses? I think you’ve watched too many idol dramas!” ”

“Oh my God! I’m so looking forward to it!”

Facing the gifts that were brought in.

Elder Zhang was also very puzzled.

“He had been in the financial world for so many years, but this was the first time he had seen Li Ruo So Humble. ”

“If it were any other time, he wouldn’t even be able to say a word to Li Ruo. ”

Not to mention talking.

He even had to make an appointment to meet her.

“After all, Li Ruo was the deputy chief of DK Financial Group. ”

But today.

“Not only did Li Ruo come to the banquet, but she also brought a gift on behalf of master five. ”

What was the purpose of DK Financial Group?

Or did ye Zhuo know master five of DK?

“Elder Zhang narrowed his eyes, then looked up at Li Ruo and said with a smile, “Master Five is really too courteous! We are already honored that you can come to miss ye’s welcoming banquet. We can’t accept such an expensive gift!” ”

“Li Ruo said with a smile, “It’s not expensive. It’s just a small token from fifth master. Where’s Miss Ye? Fifth Master said that Miss Ye has to personally unveil the red silk.” ”

Want Ye Zhuo to personally unveil it?

Could it be that ye Zhuo and fifth master really knew each other?

Elder Zhang lowered his head and looked at his assistant beside him. “Go and call miss ye over.”

“Okay.”

“It was not easy for ye Zhuo to get to know all the seniors in the financial world behind elder Zhang. At this moment, she was eating heartily in the dessert area. She did not expect that elder Zhang would send someone over to call her after she had only eaten three pieces of dessert. ”
