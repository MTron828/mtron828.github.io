How did things turn out like this?

Was the oasis project going very smoothly? Was all this just ye Zao’s plan?

No. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Impossible!

This is impossible!

Ye Zao was lying.

He was definitely lying.

The conditions on Mars were very harsh. How could the OASIS project be completed so easily?

The reason ye Zao did this was to avoid the bet agreement.

“After all, it was no longer a matter of whether the oasis project could be completed smoothly. ”

“Once ye Zao announced the failure of the OASIS project, the BET agreement would take effect and China would lose its base and aircraft carrier forever. ”

The price was too high!

Could Ye Zao afford it?

Ye Zao must be very nervous at this moment.

“Thinking of this, Mi Jiadi looked up at Ye Zao and narrowed his eyes. ”

He wanted to personally expose ye Zao’s lie.

“Mi Jiadi stood up slowly and looked at ye Zao. “As everyone knows, Mars is 400 million kilometers away from us. Dr. YC, did you finish the OASIS project or not? Isn’t it all up to you?” ”

“Right now, other than ye Zao’s spacecraft, no other country could land on Mars at all. ”

“As long as they could not land on Mars, they would not be able to personally witness whether or not ye Zao was lying. ”

“Hearing this, everyone came to their senses. ”

They all nodded in agreement.

“”Dr. Mi Jiadi’s words make sense.”The top scientific research expert of country L stood up from his chair. “Now that none of us can land on Mars, how can we verify whether or not the oasis project has been completed on time?” ”

“I also support Dr. Mi Jiadi.”

“”Dr. YC, you can’t prove it with words. You have to show some proof.” ”

More and more people supported Mi Jiadi.

“As long as ye Zhuo could not show proof, there was no way to prove that the OASIS project was successfully completed. ”

“In fact, there was another reason why these people supported Mi Jiadi. ”

The Oasis project was originally a gamble.

“When everyone knew that this project would not be completed, when they chose to gamble, they all chose China to lose. ”

“Now that China won, they, including their relatives and friends, would face huge losses. ”

“Therefore, this gamble had to be ye Zao’s loss. ”

“No matter what schemes ye Zao had, they had to follow Mi Jiadi and expose them one by one. ”

“Wen Zhi, who was originally panicking, slowly calmed down. ”

No panic.

He could not panic now. Ye Zao was just putting on an act.

“If ye Zao had been acting before, the entire base would not have accompanied ye Zao in acting. ”

The Oasis project had failed!

“Ye Zao listened to everyone’s doubts, but there was no change in her expression. After a moment, she continued to speak, “I can understand everyone’s feelings. After all, what you hear is false, and what you see is true. Now, please board the aircraft carrier and witness this visual feast together with the live broadcast audience around the world!” ”

“As she finished speaking, the enormous aircraft carrier appeared from the clouds, blocking the sun above everyone’s heads. ”

The suspended flight of stairs descended from the aircraft carrier and landed on the ground.

“Under the sunlight, the silver staircase reflected a dazzling light. ”

“”Everyone, please.” ”

“Ye Zao made a ‘please’gesture, and Yu Zifei, Tang Mi, and the others were already arranging for everyone to take their places. ”

There were a total of 200 people in the open square.

These 200 people were all research bigwigs and leaders from various countries around the world.

“One by one, they went up the stairs. ”

“Looking at their backs, Mi Jiadi was a little stunned. ”

Could it be that ye Zao really completed the Oasis Project.

“Otherwise, why would ye Zao Dare to take everyone to Mars? ”

No.

No.

How could ye Zao really complete the Oasis Project!

He wanted to see what other tricks ye Zao wanted to play.

Dr. Mi Jiadi followed him onto the aircraft carrier.

This was Mi Jiadi’s first time landing on an aircraft carrier. The internal structure of the aircraft carrier surprised him!

“Although he knew that the aircraft carrier used a lot of high-tech technology, he was still shocked when he saw these technologies with his own eyes. He could not help but look up at ye Zao again, his eyes filled with scrutiny and pity. ”

It was a pity that a talent like ye Zao was not born in C Nation.

“If ye Zao was from C Nation, they would definitely become friends. ”

“Unfortunately, they were on the opposite side! ”

The opposite side would never become friends.

“At the same time, Mi Jiadi was also somewhat impressed. ”

“Firstly, it was because of ye Zao’s age, and secondly, it was because of ye Zao’s gender. ”
