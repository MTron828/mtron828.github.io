“However, Mu Yourong did not run into Li Qiandong by chance until nightfall. ”

“”System! Where the hell have you been!”Mu Yourong clenched her fists and smashed them hard on the steering wheel, her expression very ugly. ”

“If the system was here, she would not have run into walls everywhere. ”

“Just then, her phone rang. ”

Mu Yourong took a deep breath and picked up the phone. “Dad.”

“”Yourong, how is it? Have you seen Cen Wu Ye and Young Master Li?”Soldier Mu sounded very anxious. ”

“Mu Yourong tried her best to calm herself down. “Dad, don’t be anxious. I will definitely resolve this matter!” ”

“It had only been a day, and the MU corporation was already half empty. How could soldier Mu not be anxious? ”

“Then hurry up. Dad will wait for your news.”

“”Okay.”Mu Yourong hung up the phone, her brows tightly knitted together. ”

“At this moment, she suddenly thought of a place. ”

“Darkness Bar.., ”

she remembered that the system had mentioned before that Li Qiandong was a regular customer of this bar.

He would go there several times a week.

So...

“If she went to Darkness Bar, she would definitely meet Li Qiandong. ”

“Soon, the car stopped at the entrance of the bar. ”

“At the same time, the black car that had been following her all along also stopped at the entrance of the bar. ”

Five strong men walked out of the car and walked into the bar one by one.

The bar was filled with drunken debauchery and a mixture of dragons and snakes.

Mu Yourong searched the crowd for Li Qiandong’s figure.

Unfortunately...

There was none.

“Li Qiandong, whom she could normally easily see, seemed to have vanished from the face of the Earth at this moment. ”

“Although she could not find Li Qiandong in the bar, Mu Yourong did not intend to give up just like that. ”

She went to the bar counter at the entrance and ordered a glass of Blue Hawaiian.

She was gambling.

She was betting that Li Qiandong was there.

“As long as Li Qiandong was in this bar, he would definitely see her. ”

Mu Yourong had just sat down on the high chair when she was accosted by a middle-aged man. “A beauty alone? Making Friends?”

Mu Yourong raised her head in disgust. “Do you deserve it?”

“Little did she know that the moment she raised her head, the man standing next to her conveniently threw a white pill into her glass. ”

The white pill melted when it came into contact with water.

“By the time Mu Yourong raised her glass, the white pill had already disappeared without a trace. ”

The alcohol content of the Blue Hawaii was not high.

“But after drinking a cup of wine, Mu Yourong felt Dizzy. ”

Her head was heavy and her feet were light.

“Her entire body was hot, and her face was extremely red. ”

Mu Yourong pressed her temples and stumbled towards the washroom. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“”Miss, Are You Alright?”The middle-aged man who had tried to hit on Mu Yourong earlier immediately walked over and hugged her. ”

“Mu Yourong’s consciousness was completely muddled, and she fell into the man’s arms. “Hot, so hot...” ”

The man gave his companion a look.

“Immediately, four men surrounded her. ”

They led Mu Yourong out of the door.

This kind of thing often happened in bars.

So the guests were already used to it.

“Just like that, Mu Yourong was led by five people to a cheap hotel. ”

...

“When Mu Yourong woke up again, she only felt dizzy and Dizzy. Her entire body was very uncomfortable, sore and painful. ”

She remembered ordering a glass of Blue Hawaii at the bar last night.

“After drinking the Blue Hawaii, she seemed to be drunk. ”

And then?

She was taken away by someone she didn’t know?

“At this moment, an extremely unbearable scene suddenly appeared before Mu Yourong’s eyes. ”

Mu Yourong’s face instantly turned white.

Was that a dream?

Mu Yourong’s hands subconsciously gripped the blanket under her.

Sheets?

Where did the sheets come from?

“Mu Yourong lowered her head and looked down. With this look, she instantly sobered up and screamed in fear, “Ah!” ”

Who were these five people?

Why were there five unfamiliar men on her bed?

“Pa!”

“One of them raised his hand and slapped mu yourong, “Slut! What are you shouting for!” ”

“A piercing pain came from her face, but at this moment, this pain could no longer compare to the panic in Mu Yourong’s heart. With a trembling voice, she said, “Beast! Bastard! What have you done to me?” ”

“Hearing this, a burst of laughter immediately came from the room. ”

“”Brothers, this B * tch is asking us what we did to her last night? Why don’t we help her recall?” ”

“Mu Yourong looked at these five men, and scene after scene suddenly appeared in her mind. ”

It was like a movie playing.

She remembered.

She remembered everything.

“At this moment, humiliation, unbearable, and assault covered mu Yourong’s entire body. ”

“Mu Yourong hugged the blanket tightly and cried, “Call the police! I want to call the police!” ”

“”Call it in.”A cell phone was thrown over. “Since your eldest miss mu is shameless, what does it matter if we small fry spend two years in prison?” ”
