“Since he had already bought the items, he naturally had to give them to elder Bai. ”

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “What if you don’t pass the test? Won’t these things be given away for Nothing?” ” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Do you really hope that I Won’t pass the test?”Lin Ze turned to look at Bai Jingshu and asked with a smile.

“”Of course not. I’m just making an analogy.”As she said this, a worried expression appeared on Bai Jingshu’s face. She continued, “But I don’t know what Grandpa’s test criteria are either. You’d better pay more attention in the near future.” ”

“”Yes, I know that.”Lin Ze nodded. “Don’t worry. I’ll definitely work hard to make Grandpa like you. Then, I’ll marry you as soon as possible.” ”

Bai Jingshu’s face was slightly red.

Lin Ze held Bai Jingshu’s hand. “Let’s go for a stroll by the beach.”

“Okay.”

The two of them went to the beach.

“Today was a rest day. There were a lot of people going for a stroll by the beach. In the air above the sea, all sorts of flying machines were circling around. It was very lively. ”

“Bai Jingshu continued, “I’ve arranged to meet Manwen on Sunday. You’ll go with me.” ”

“”So you’ve arranged to meet him,”Lin ze said with a smile. “No Wonder I asked him out last night. He said that he already has an appointment on Sunday.” ”

“”Yes,”Bai Jingshu continued, “I’ve been friends with Manwen for life and death. We’ve been through thick and thin together. We’ve promised each other that if anyone has a partner first, we must tell each other.” ”

“At that time, Bai Jingshu thought that she would probably die alone. She did not expect that she would always be surprised. ”

“How did you and Manwen Meet?”Lin Ze was a little curious.

“Bai Jingshu smiled and sank into her memories, she continued, “When I met him, he was twelve years old. At that time, I liked the culture of Earth. He was a profligate son and we did not have any friends. Then, it was as if we met another version of ourselves. Later on, the three of US became good friends who talked about everything and experienced many things together.” ”

“”The three of you?”Lin Ze asked curiously, “Who else is there?” ”

“”There’s someone called Fan Mu,”Bai Jingshu continued, “But fan mu is now an instructor at the Military Academy.” ”

“I see.”Lin Ze nodded.

...

On the other side.

Bai Mo arrived at the place where the Manwen Association would be held.

“Half an hour later, Manwen and his assistant appeared. ”

“Bai Mo immediately took out a small mirror and tidied up her makeup. After confirming that there were no problems, she walked out and pretended to be surprised. “Brother Manwen, what a coincidence!” ”

“When he heard Bai Mo’s voice, Manwen furrowed his brows. Why was it Bai Mo again? ”

“These past few days, Bai Mo would always appear in front of him, unintentionally or unintentionally. She was like a fly that he couldn’t shake off. Manwen was also very helpless. If it wasn’t for the fact that she was Bai Jingshu’s younger sister.., man Wen would have asked her to leave long ago. ”

“Bai Mo jogged over. “Brother Man Wen, where are you going?” ”

“”I’m here on official business,”man Wen said. ”

“”OH.”Bai Mo nodded. “Brother Man Wen, have you been very busy these days?” ”

Man Wen couldn’t be bothered to deal with Bai Mo anymore. He just nodded.

“Bai Mo continued, “Brother Man Wen, my sister came back two days ago. Have you guys met?” ”

“”Not yet.”Bai Jingshu had asked him out before, but Manwen had been quite busy these past few days, so she had pushed it back a few days. ”

“Bai Mo looked at manwen and continued, “Oh right, Brother Manwen, my sister has found a boyfriend.” ”

“Really?”Manwen asked.

“Bai Mo nodded and continued, “Of course it’s true. Can I still lie to you about my sister?” ”

“What a good Bai Jingshu. The reason why she hid it from man Wen was definitely because she wanted to be two-timing. Luckily, she had exposed it in time. She did not expect Bai Jingshu to be so shameless when she looked at how happy she was. ”

She even wanted to be two-timing.

“This time, man Wen should be able to see Bai Jingshu’s true colors. ”

“Bai Mo observed man Wen’s expression and continued, “Brother Man Wen, my sister is so close to you. Didn’t she tell you?” ”

“What are you trying to say?”Man Wen looked at Bai Mo..

“Bai Mo was stunned. “Brother Man Wen, i...” ”

“Before she could finish her sentence, man Wen had already planned to.., “Bai Mo, you don’t have to sow discord in front of me. I know what you’re trying to do. “The reason why I’ve been holding back and not falling out is because you’re sister Jingshu. I also hope that you have some self-awareness. Girls should try not to embarrass themselves and not embarrass themselves. Your eating style is really too ugly.” ”
