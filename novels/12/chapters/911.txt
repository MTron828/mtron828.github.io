“Chapter 912: 212: it’s too late to regret, I have half a month’s worth of news! 5”

Translator: 549690339

Cen Yuyan was song Chenyu’s fan group operating officer.

Cen Yuyan’s sudden withdrawal from the group caused the other fans in the fan group to discuss animatedly.

“Song Chenyu edited a paragraph and sent it out: [ Yan Yan has been feeling a little unwell recently, so she has temporarily withdrawn from the group. Don’t worry, everyone, she will return. After that, I’ll have to trouble zhizhi to temporarily take over Yan Yan’s job. ] ”

“[ okay, Chenyu. ] ”

“After comforting her fans, song Chenyu opened other social media accounts and realized that Cen Yuyan was nowhere to be seen. ”

It seemed that Cen Yuyan was really angry this time. She was serious about severing ties with her.

Song Chenyu frowned slightly.

What should she do now?

It looked like she had to think of a way.

“Fortunately, Cen Yuyan was a brainless person. ”

“If it was someone else, it would be a little difficult to resolve. ”

Song Chenyu made a call. “Zhou Rui.”

“It had always been Zhou Rui who called Song Chenyu. He did not expect song Chenyu to call him as well. Zhou Rui asked in surprise, “Song Chenyu? Why are you looking for me?” ”

“I had a misunderstanding with Cen Yuyan and I need your help.”

“”Sure, no problem.”Zhou Rui continued, “Five million.” ” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Song Chenyu frowned. “Has Cen Yuyan not fed you yet?”

“Who would complain about having more money?”Zhou Rui asked back.

“Song Chenyu had indeed earned a lot of money over the years, but the Zhou family was like a bottomless pit that could not be filled at all. If she continued to satisfy them unconditionally, the consequences would be unimaginable. ”

“Song Chenyu continued, “If that’s the case, then it’ll be meaningless. In any case, Cen Yuyan has already fallen out with me, so let’s shed all pretense of cordiality together!” ”

“The last sentence was ruthless and ruthless, causing Zhou Rui’s brows to twitch. ”

“In the past, he was unafraid of wearing shoes when he was barefooted, but it was different now. If Cen Yuyan knew everything, how would he marry Cen Yuyan? How could he inherit the Cen family’s assets? ”

“”Let’s talk it out!”Zhou Rui continued, “We’re all on the same side, why are you so angry? Tell me, how do you want me to help you?” ”

“I need to see Cen Yuyan.”

“When she and Cen Yuyan were good friends, it was easy for them to meet. But now, Cen Yuyan had blocked all her social media accounts. Without Zhou Rui’s help, it was even harder to see Cen Yuyan. ”

“Zhou Rui continued, “Then let’s go to Pearl Square at eight tomorrow night. I’ll go there with Cen Yuyan to watch a movie.” ”

“Sure.”

Song Chenyu narrowed his eyes on the other end of the phone.

Zou family.

Cen Yuyan calmed down after a while. She went to the bathroom to wash her face and walked to the banquet hall.

Today was Tian Tian’s 10th birthday party after all. The capital especially valued the child’s 10th birthday. It was not good for her fourth aunt to be absent for no reason.

“Just as she walked into the banquet hall, she saw ye Zhuo talking to his three older sisters. ”

Cen Yuyan felt a little embarrassed when she recalled the various misunderstandings she had towards ye Zhuo in the past. It was all song Chenyu’s fault.

It was all song Chenyu’s fault.

“If song Chenyu had not accused ye Zhuo of seducing Lu Xiu, she definitely would not have had such a prejudice against Ye Zhuo. ”

“Cen Yuyan walked over to greet him. “Eldest sister, second sister, third sister, Zhuozhuo.” ”

“The fourth girl is here.”

“Ye Zhuoluo was no different from before. He smiled at Cen Yuyan. “Fourth sister.”From Cen Yuyan’s appearance, it was most likely that she was awake. Hopefully, she could stay awake forever. ”

“Although song Chenyu was a few levels higher than CEN Yuyan, if Cen Yuyan was tricked by song Chenyu again, she could only blame herself for being stupid. ”

...

“After Tian Tian’s birthday party ended, Cen Yuyan returned to the CEN family. ”

“When Old Madam Cen saw her return, she said, “Did you see the Ugly Fish’s true face?” ”

“Old Madam Cen was feeling a little unwell today. Because it was a small problem, she did not trouble ye Zao. She went to the hospital by herself, which was why she did not make it to Tian Tian’s birthday party. ”

“Look carefully.”Cen Yuyan looked dejected.

“Old Mrs. Cen rolled her eyes at her and continued, “It’s good that you’ve seen clearly. It’s not too late to see clearly now. I’m really afraid that you’ll be deceived by that ugly fish for the rest of your life!” ”

“Cen Yuyan lowered her head, feeling very uncomfortable in her heart. ”

It was only after she saw song Chenyu’s true face that she understood old Mrs. Cen’s feelings at that time.

“If she could turn back time, she would definitely choose to travel back in time and hammer her previous foolish self to death. ”

Unfortunately.

She couldn’t turn back time.

Old Mrs. Cen glanced at Cen Yuyan. “I heard from your second sister that you found a boyfriend?”
