Who Didn’t know that China was a backward country.

“Therefore, in the hacker world, no one would put Chinese hackers in their eyes. ”

Who would have thought that Baron would fall at the hands of Chinese people.

“After thinking for a while, William continued, “Were you careless?” ”

“Baron said, “A week ago, I had the same thoughts as you. However, the other party might not be Chinese and just temporarily work in China.” ”

“William smiled and said, “No matter who he is, as long as the two of US work together, we will definitely be able to make him surrender.” ”

“Then you go online now. Let’s talk online.”

“”Sure,”William replied. ”

“After hanging up the phone, William went online. ”

“Although the two of them had not worked together for a long time, they still had a tacit understanding. ”

“Seeing that they were about to succeed in cracking the firewall, William smiled and said, “I thought this firewall was very powerful, but it turns out that it’s just so-so.” ”

“Baron had been dealing with the other party for more than a week, so he knew that things were not that simple. “We can’t be happy too early. There were a few times when the progress bar had reached 99% , but it still fell short.” ”

“Is that so?”William did not take this matter to heart.

Success!

The originally stiff firewall was broken in an instant.

Baron looked at the computer screen in disbelief.

William’s laughter rang out once again. “Didn’t you say that everything would be for naught?”

“Impressive!”Baron gave William a thumbs up.

“At this moment, William’s expression suddenly changed on the other end of the screen. ”

“What’s Wrong?”Baron asked.

William frowned tightly. “Look at the computer screen.”

Baron looked up.

What he saw on the computer screen was a picture of an inverted thumb.

It was full of irony.

“At this moment, a line of text slowly appeared on the screen: [ two foolish sons, Daddy doesn’t have time to play with you now. If you attack our database again, do you believe that Daddy will sell your personal information and address to the bounty hunter? ] ”

“At the bottom of the text, the precise location of the two was shown. ”

Baron and William were both people who were put on bounty by various countries.

“If this information was leaked, their lives would be in danger. ”

“At this moment, Baron and William’s faces turned pale. ”

Especially William’s.

“At first, he did not take him seriously. ”

He did not expect him to be so powerful!

Who was this person?

“Baron reacted at the first moment. He immediately followed the web page that the other party sent and edited a paragraph and sent it, “Sorry, Dad! We were wrong! We were blind! Please show mercy and let us off!” ”

“Compared to his life, calling him daddy was nothing? ”

William also quickly begged for mercy. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“It won’t be the third time.”

“”Daddy, don’t worry. There won’t be a next time. We swear!” ”

“As soon as this paragraph was sent over, everything on the computer screen disappeared. Everything returned to normal, as if nothing had happened. ”

William’s face was slightly pale as he panted heavily.

“Baron was also quite frightened. “William, do you think the other party will go back on their word?” ”

“Once their address was discovered by the bounty hunters, the consequences would be unimaginable. ”

“Baron never expected that he would provoke such a thorn. He also never expected that one day, he would fall into the hands of his peers. ”

“”Probably, probably not.”William was quite uncertain. ”

“Baron continued, “Why don’t we run?” ”

“”If the other party really sells our address to the bounty hunter, there’s no point in running. Unless we never touch electronic products in our lives, otherwise, he’ll have a way to track us.” ”

Baron Sighed.

“William comforted him, “Since he has already promised us that he won’t sell the information to the bounty hunter, I believe that he will definitely keep his promise. Don’t worry too much.” ”

“Okay.”

...

On the other side.

At the picnic spot.

Song Chenyu called Cen Yuyan to the side.

“Cen Yuyan was still holding a freshly roasted kebab in her hand. “Chenyu, do you have something to say to me?” ”

“Song Chenyu nodded and continued, “Yuyan, the weather today is pretty good. Why Don’t you take advantage of today to confess to Lu Xiu and give yourself a chance as well as Lu Xiu?” ”

“What if he rejects me?”Cen Yuyan was a little worried.

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “It’s not easy to find two-legged toads. Two-legged men are everywhere. You have such good conditions and are so beautiful. If Lu Xiu rejects you, it means that he has bad taste.” ”

“After saying that.., song Chenyu continued, “Both of you are not young anymore. There are some things that you have to say. Hiding them will only delay each other. Yuyan, in my heart, you have always been a person who can take things and let them go. You Dare to take responsibility.” ”
