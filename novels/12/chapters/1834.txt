“Qiu Di raised his head slightly and continued, “Father, Do You Trust Me?” ”

“I do.”Qiu Changzhen nodded.

“He only had one daughter. If he didn’t trust Qiu Di, who else could he trust? ”

“Moreover, Qiu Di was indeed very outstanding. ”

Qiu Di made him believe.

It was just that he was a little worried.

“After all, the relationship between the eight great clans, Ye Zhuo and ye Han, was not shallow. ”

“If anything went wrong at this moment, then one wrong step would result in a complete loss! ”

“Autumn flute continued, “Since you believe in me, then don’t ask too much.” ”

“If ye Han could remember anything, he would have remembered long ago, so why wait until now? ”

So what if the eight great clans saw something?

“The eight great clans were so powerful, but didn’t Ye Zhuo still die? ”

“Autumn town scratched his head. “Di’er, I keep feeling that what you’re doing is too risky. Why Don’t you quickly call Ye and Wu Han Back? You Can’t be too careful!” ”

“”Father, you’ve been so careful for so many years. What did you get in the end?”Autumn town turned to look at autumn town. ”

Autumn town had been careful all his life. He didn’t dare to do this or that. He was afraid that he would accidentally do something wrong and expose himself.

And in the end?

“Not only did he fail, but he was even surpassed by a little girl named Ye Zao. ”

What was ye Zao?

“If it were not for her hesitation back then, ye Zao would have been her servant. ”

“Even now, Qiu Di was very regretful. ”

She regretted why she did not keep ye Zao back then.

But what happened in the past was already in the past.

“Even if she regretted it, there was nothing she could do. ”

“She could only watch helplessly as ye Zao became more and more outstanding, and in the end, his name shook the world. ”

“If it wasn’t for ye Zao, how could she be like this now? ”

“Thinking of this, a sinister light flashed in Qiu Di’s eyes. ”

“Hearing this, Qiu Changzhen was directly stunned. He opened his mouth but didn’t say anything. ”

Because what Qiu di said was very right.

“His whole life was because he had taken care of too many things, which was why he couldn’t accomplish anything. ”

The words that filled Qiu Changzhen’s heart turned into a sigh.

This was all he had in his life. What happened next would depend on Qiu Di.

“Fortunately, Qiu Di was different from him. ”

“Qiu di continued, “Father, don’t worry. I will definitely not let you down.” ” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Qiu Changzhen nodded. He could not help but ask, “Are there really no problems with the eight great clans?” ”

“”You don’t trust me, so why don’t you trust the Witch Doctor?”Qiu Di asked. ”

Witch Doctor!

“Hearing this, Qiu Chang Zhen’s eyes widened in disbelief. “You, you mean, the Witch Doctor has made a move!”The Witch Doctor was the most powerful evil doctor in changyue country besides Ye Zhuo! ”

“However, ever since he failed to compete with Ye Zhuo three years ago, he began to live a secluded life and disappeared without a trace. Qiu Chang Zhen never thought that the witch doctor would be involved in Ye Han’s matter! ”

“However, thinking about it, it was understandable. In changyue, the Witch Doctor’s biggest competitor was ye Zhuo. ”

“With Ye Zhuo’s death, he had nothing to worry about! ”

“”Yes.”Autumn flute nodded. “So, father, there’s no need for you to worry about something that you didn’t do.” ”

“Hearing this, autumn town heaved a sigh of relief. ”

“”Di’er, then I’ll wait for Your Good News.”Autumn town smiled and looked at autumn flute. ”

Autumn Flute’s lips curled up.

“Autumn town continued, “Right, have you checked on that low-class person?” ”

“The low-class person was naturally ye Zhuo, who was on Earth. ”

Autumn flute maintained his smile. “I’ve already checked. There’s nothing to be afraid of.”

“”Alright.”Autumn town stood up from his chair. “Di’er, I’ll be leaving first.” ”

“I’ll send you off.”Autumn flute followed autumn town’s footsteps and sent autumn town to the door.

“When he reached the door, Qiu Changzhen looked like he wanted to say something but hesitated. ”

“Seeing him like this, Qiu di said, “If you want to say something, just say it.” ”

“Qiu Changzhen nodded and continued, “If you have time, go back and see your mother. It hasn’t been easy for her all these years.” ”

“Is she my mother?”Qiu Di looked at Qiu Changzhen.

Qiu Di’s mother was her stepmother.

“Back then, when her stepmother came to the Qiu family, Qiu Di was only nine years old. ”

How could a nine-year-old child accept his father’s second wife so easily?

She always felt that this new mother was here to snatch her father away from her.

“Sure enough, in the second year of their marriage, the new mother became pregnant with a second child. ”

“However, very soon, the stepmother miscarried and could never get pregnant. Therefore, over the years, the stepmother and father did not have children. ”

“Therefore, her stepmother treated Qiu di as her own flesh and blood. ”

“Unfortunately, she was not her own flesh and blood. After all, she was not her own flesh and blood. Qiu Di could not treat her stepmother as her own mother. She felt that her stepmother was just pretending and ignored her concern. After she became an adult, she immediately moved out of the Qiu family. ”

“Up until now, Qiu di still could not face her stepmother. ”

“Qiu Changzhen Sighed and did not continue this topic. “Di’er, just send her here. You should go back quickly.” ”

Qiu Di turned around and left.

“Looking at Qiu Di’s back as she turned around and left, Qiu Changzhen sighed. Qiu Di was still unwilling to accept Zhuang ru. What should he do? ”

“”Officer Qiu.”At this moment, the assistant’s voice sounded beside him. Qiu Changzhen finally reacted and turned around to board the aircraft. ”

The aircraft soon disappeared into the air.

“Not long after Qiu Changzhen left, Wu Han returned. “Miss, this is the information on the transstellar case you requested.” ”

“Qiu Di reached out to receive the information and continued, “Did Shangguan Jue say anything to you?” ”
