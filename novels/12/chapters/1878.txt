Translator: 549690339

“After asking one question for a long time, he ziteng was very nervous. ”

What if Xu Yao had a problem with him?

It was not easy for him to catch up with Xu Yao.

He ziteng held his breath and listened to the other side’s answer.

One second.

Two seconds.

Time passed little by little.

“It was clearly only a few seconds, but he ziteng felt that every second was like a year. ”

“After a long while, he finally received an answer. “Sure.” ”

“Really?”He ziteng was ecstatic. He thought he was hearing things.

“Xu Yao smiled and said, “Of course it’s true. Isn’t it just going to watch a movie? How can I Lie to You?” ”

“”Okay, then it’s settled.”He ziteng continued, “I’ll contact you tomorrow.” ”

“Okay.”

On the other side.

“After hanging up Xu Yao’s call, he ziteng was a little excited. ”

“He was originally regretting why he drank last night. If he didn’t drink, he wouldn’t have had sex after drinking. ”

“Now, he didn’t regret it at all! ”

He was even secretly happy.

He was actually Xu Yao’s first man.

“After all, girls nowadays were more open-minded. It was really not easy to find a girl who was still pure. ”

“When he thought of the blood stains on the white sheets, he ziteng could not help but smile. ”

He could not help but want to share this matter with others.

He ziteng took out his phone and made a call.

“When his good friend heard this, he teased with a smile, “Brother, are you sure it was not made up the day after tomorrow?” ”

“Nowadays, technology was so advanced. There was nothing that could not be done if one could not think of it. ”

“Hearing this, he ziteng said speechlessly, “Liu Zetian, what nonsense are you talking about! I think you’re just jealous of me!” ”

“”Jealous my ass,”Liu Zetian continued, “But, brother, be careful. Conservative girls like this are especially hard to get rid of. When the time comes, you can’t even get rid of them even if you want to! They’re like dog skin plaster!” ”

Girls like this valued their first time more. They believed that the boy who took away their first time had to be responsible for themselves.

Liu Zetian was more open in the circle. He was usually not willing to touch more conservative girls.

Unless it was the kind that clearly marked the price.

“Hearing this, he ziteng said very excitedly, “What are you talking about! Am I that kind of irresponsible man? Since I want her innocence, I will definitely be responsible for her!” ”

“Liu Zetian was a little speechless and said, “Brother, you are too excited. I am just giving you a suggestion. Since you are so serious, then I wish you two have a child soon.” ”

“Speaking up to this point, Liu Zetian paused and continued, “But, are you really sure about that woman?” ”

“”Yes.”He ziteng said very firmly, “I am sure! It is her. Other than her, I don’t want anyone else.” ”

“He had reached his age, and he really liked Xu Yao. ”

Xu Yao was very good in all aspects.

What was he not satisfied with?

“Hearing this, Liu Zetian was very shocked. ”

He could not believe that a steel-like straight man like he ziteng would one day fall in love and be unable to extricate himself.

“Are you serious?”Liu Zetian asked.

“”Yes, very serious.”He ziteng continued, “So don’t joke about her. I don’t like it.” ”

“Liu Zetian smiled and said, “It’s not easy, brother! What do you mean by bringing her out for everyone to see?” ”

“”Soon, soon.”He ziteng continued, “Wait for me to discuss with her, then bring her out to see everyone.” ”

“Hearing that he ziteng did not seem to be joking, Liu Zetian continued, “Brother, when did you meet that woman? Don’t be fooled by her.” ”

Liu Zetian had been in the circle all year round and had seen all kinds of tricks.

“He ziteng was one of his good brothers, and he didn’t want to see he ziteng fall for her tricks. ”

“”Don’t worry, she’s not that kind of person,”he ziteng said. ”

“Liu Zetian frowned slightly. “You’ve only known that woman for a few days! How can you trust her so much?”Perhaps because he had seen it many times, Liu Zetian was a person who didn’t believe in love. ”

The so-called love relied on one thing to protect it.

That was money.

“Without Money, forget about love, even the most basic kinship could not be protected. ”

“”What do you mean by that woman, that woman! She has a name! Her name is Xu Yao.”He ziteng continued, “If you continue like this, I’ll be angry!” ”

“Xu Yao?”Liu Zetian raised his eyebrows. “Her aunt is Xu Chaonan?”

“I think so... do you know her?”He ziteng asked.

“Liu Zetian continued, “I don’t know her, but I heard my dad talking about Xu Chaonan! If Xu Yao is really Xu Chaonan’s niece, then she is not an ordinary person.” ”
