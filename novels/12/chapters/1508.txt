“Faced with Ye Zao’s questioning, Sun Jiayi was inexplicably flustered. ”

“Her eyes were clear, as if she could dig through layers of truth to find the most fatal answer and see through People’s hearts. ” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Sun Jiayi swallowed her throat and raised her head.

An illusion.

It must be an illusion.

“In terms of age, ye Zao was three years younger than her. What would a 20-year-old girl know. ”

“Sun Jiayi calmed herself down and said, “Missy, my mother brewed the medicine.” ”

Ye Zhuo turned his eyes slightly and looked at Xia Xiaoman.

“Xia Xiaoman immediately reacted. “Butler, go and call Auntie Sun over.” ”

“”Yes, Madam.”The Butler was very puzzled. ”

Could there be a problem with the medicine?

“But Auntie Sun was very serious in her work. Every time she brewed the medicine, she would personally stand by her side. There shouldn’t be any problems. ”

The Butler walked quickly to the side hall where Auntie Sun was cleaning.

“Auntie Sun!”

“Butler!”Auntie Sun raised her head.

What was the Butler doing here?

Could it be because of master Feng?

Didn’t she already explicitly reject the butler?

How could he still have the nerve to come!

An impatient look flashed across Auntie Sun’s eyes. This Butler was really bad. He didn’t even have the slightest discernment.

“Just as she was thinking of how to reject the butler, the butler continued, “Auntie Sun, Madam is looking for you. Come with me.” ”

Auntie Sun’s refusal stopped at the tip of her tongue.

Xia Xiaoman was looking for her?

Why was Xia Xiaoman looking for her?

“Auntie Sun placed the feather duster on the table and continued, “Butler, did madam say what she was looking for me for?” ”

“”No,”the butler shook his head, “Come with me quickly. Madam seems to be in a hurry.” ”

Ye Zhuo only asked who brewed the medicine and did not clearly indicate that there was a problem with the medicine. He could not directly tell Auntie Sun that there was a problem with the medicine brewed by her. What If ye Zhuo wanted to praise Auntie Sun for making a good medicine?

“Okay.”Auntie Sun wiped her hands on the apron and followed the housekeeper’s footsteps.

“When they reached the front hall, they saw Sun Jiayi standing in front of Ye Zhuo and Xia Xiaoman. A bunch of relatives of the Lin family were also gathered in the living room. Some were playing mahjong while others were chatting. ”

“On the table in front of Xia Xiaoman, there was a bowl of medicine. ”

“Seeing this bowl of medicine, Auntie Sun’s heart skipped a beat. ”

“Fifteen minutes ago, she had asked Sun Jiayi to bring this medicine over. Normally, Xia Xiaoman would have drank it while it was still hot because she was afraid that the effects of the medicine would wear off. However, today, she had not drank it yet. ”

Could it be...

They had discovered something?

Auntie Sun licked her lips nervously.

“The Butler walked to the front and said, “Madam, Auntie Sun is already here.” ”

“Xia Xiaoman nodded and looked at ye Zao. “Zao Zao, this is Auntie Sun. If you have anything to say, just ask her directly.” ”

So it was ye Zao who was looking for her.

Auntie Sun narrowed her eyes.

Ye Zao was only twenty years old. She could really tell that there was something added to the medicine.

“However, the thing that she added was colorless and tasteless. Even if she tasted it personally, she would not be able to tell what it was. Otherwise, Xia Xiaoman had been drinking it for almost half a year and she would not be able to drink anything! ”

“If she could really be discovered so easily, Xia Xiaoman would have already discovered that the medicine was not right. ”

“Therefore, it was definitely not because of the medicine. ”

“Thinking of this, Auntie Sun calmed down and walked in front of Ye Zhuo. “Miss. .” ”

“Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and continued, “Have you always been in charge of brewing my fourth aunt’s medicine?” ”

“”Yes,”Auntie Sun said. ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “During the process of brewing the medicine, have you ever left the kitchen?” ”

“No.”Auntie Sun shook her head.

“”Since you haven’t, then how did you get the birth control pill in this medicine?”Ye Zhuo’s voice suddenly turned cold. “Why did you put the birth control pill in my fourth aunt’s medicine?” ”

“Hearing this, Auntie Sun’s face turned pale. She thought she was hearing things. ”

“How, how could this be? ”

How did ye Zao Find Out?

Sun Jiayi was also dumbfounded. His entire body was ice-cold.

“Even the others beside him were shocked by ye Zao’s words, especially Xia Xiaoman. “Zao Zao, what, what did you say? Birth Control Pill?” ”

“Ye Zao nodded, “Yes, there are birth control pills in this pill.”. “Fourth aunt, do you remember when I checked your pulse, I said that you had taken birth control pills before?”? “I thought it was the birth control pills left on the vegetables I usually eat. I didn’t expect that there was a mole in the family!” ”

Ye Zao really didn’t expect that the problem was actually the servants in Xia Xiaoman’s house.

The maid drugged the employer!

It was simply unheard of!

“Auntie Sun almost lost her balance, she hurriedly said, “No! I didn’t! I didn’t put any birth control pills in it! Missy! You Can’t accuse people without reason. Although I’m a maid, I also have human rights and dignity! Without any evidence, what right do you have to say that I put birth control pills in the pills ”
