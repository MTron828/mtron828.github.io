Cen Shaoqing:”...”painful.

He was used to standing at a high place and was even more used to strategizing. Everything was in his hands.

He never felt that his life plan would be interrupted by someone.

“Therefore, he did not care about the law of true fragrance. ”

“He did not expect that in the end, he would still bend his back for someone. ”

“A beauty’s bed, a hero’s tomb. ”

This sentence was absolutely correct.

“Seeing that Cen Shaoqing had not said a word, old Mrs. Cen became even more proud. She stood on the small stool and even crossed her legs. ”

“Because she was too proud, she did not expect that Cen Shaoqing, who had an unstable center of gravity, would almost fall down. Cen Shaoqing was quick-witted and pulled old Mrs. Cen’s arm without any resentment, “Be careful. I’ll help you down. It’s cold at the top, so it’s best to be grounded.” ”

“”Brat, are you finding me short?” ”

Cen Shaoqing opened his thin lips slightly. “You said it yourself.”

“The old lady directly gave Cen Shaoqing a crutch, “Don’t look down on your grandmother. I’m a little short now. When I was young, I was a great beauty whose name shook Jiangnan! Many people cried and shouted that they wanted to marry me! Those who chased me hand in hand could circle the earth ten times! “Back then, if it wasn’t for your grandfather’s flowery words that deceived me, do you think I would have followed him?” ” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Recalling the past, old Mrs. Cen raised her chin proudly. ”

“It was the first time Zhou Xiang heard Old Mrs. Cen talk about the past. With a curious face, she said, “Mom! Really?” ”

“Then how could it be fake?”Old Mrs. Cen raised her chin even higher.

After Cen Shaoqing went to the company.

Zhou Xiang also began to discuss with old Mrs. Cen about returning to Beijing.

...

On the other side.

The song family.

Song Shiyu was sitting in the study. His assistant was standing in front of the desk reporting to him about his work.

“After reporting about his work, his assistant looked up at song Shiyu and said, “Boss, Miss Ye and Cen Fifth Master are together.” ”

Together?

Was it the one that he understood?

Song Shiyu’s face turned dark in an instant. “When did this happen?”

“The assistant mustered up his courage and said, “Last Night.” ”

The air became very oppressive in that instant.

“Just as the assistant thought that song Shiyu was about to lose his temper, song Shiyu suddenly looked up and said, “You can go out.” ”

“As if he had been granted amnesty, his assistant immediately walked out of the door. ”

“Song Shiyu pulled open the drawer, took out a milk candy, and opened the candy wrapper. ”

It was not until the sweet taste of the milk candy spread on the tip of his tongue that the hostility in his eyes dissipated a little.

“Song Shiyu leaned back in his chair and looked at the ceiling, his eyes so dark that they could not see the bottom. ”

“”Little brother, don’t be afraid. I’m here with you.” ”

“”Little brother, does it hurt? Just Bite Me and it won’t hurt anymore.” ”

The young man curled up in the corner opened his mouth and bit the girl’s arm.

He had thought that he would hear the girl’s cry.

But he did not.

“Not only did she not cry, but she revealed a row of white teeth. She smiled at him and said, “Little brother, it doesn’t hurt at all.” ”

“In the darkness, that smile was like the brightest sunshine, dispelling the haze in his heart. ”

“From then on, Song Shiyu made up his mind that he would spend his whole life to protect this smile. ”

Song Shiyu’s eyes replayed the encounter that day at the Dragon King’s Temple Mountain.

On the first day of the New Year.

He had a sudden idea. He dismissed his bodyguards and assistants and walked up the mountain alone.

“At the Temple Fair, he saw a different side of her. ”

“Among the crowd, he saw her at a glance. ”

She was very confident.

She was also very flamboyant.

Her whole body exuded a unique charm.

“When he was going down the mountain, his low blood sugar suddenly flared up. If she hadn’t helped him in time, the consequences would have been unimaginable. ”

“Then, she handed him a big white rabbit. ”

“In the past, he had never eaten sugar. ”

It was also this piece of candy that completely opened the door to his memories.

“Later on, in order to confirm that she was her, he did not hesitate to use old madam song’s illness to trick her into coming to the song family. ”

As expected.

Just as he thought.

She was her!

“At this moment, there was a knock on the door. ”

Song Shiyu did not answer.

“”Shiyu, it’s me,”sister Hong’s voice sounded from outside the door. ”

“Come in.”

Sister Hong came in from outside the door.

“Sister Hong was Old Madam Song’s personal assistant when she was alive. She had followed Old Madam Song for more than ten years, and Old Madam song treated sister Hong Like family. Therefore, song Shiyu respected sister Hong very much. ”

“Sister Hong was nearly forty-five years old, but she maintained her appearance very well. There were almost no traces of age on her face. ”

“Sit.”

Song Shiyu pointed at the chair and said.

“Sister Hong did not sit down immediately. Instead, she pulled open the curtains and said, “The weather outside is very good. You should open the window to get some fresh air.” ”
