“Li Wen said, “You two go ahead and play. I Won’t participate.”Although he didn’t drink too much, his head was still dizzy. ”

“Zhang Qingqing said, “It’s too boring to play with two people.” ”

“”That’s right, that’s right.”Fat Tiger patted Li Wen. “Mozzie, this is a rare opportunity. Don’t be such a Killjoy!” ”

“Helpless, Li Wen had no choice but to agree to play with the Liquor Enforcement Order. ”

“Zhang Qingqing did not know anything else, but she was best at the Liquor Enforcement Order. She had previously taken a part-time job at a KTV and met Wu Youyu at a KTV. ”

“However, Fat Tiger was also a little powerful. After a few rounds, Zhang Qingqing had also drunk a few glasses of white wine. Fortunately, the container for the white wine was not big, and she had drunk quite a lot of beer before. Not long after, Zhang Qingqing fainted. ”

“When Zhang Qingqing woke up again, it was already past five o’clock in the morning. ”

The private room was very quiet.

“Li Wen and fat tiger fell asleep on the ground, while dog two was lying on the coffee table. ”

Ouyang Qian should have returned to her room.

“Looking at the scene in front of her, Zhang Qingqing was stunned for a moment. Then, she quickly reacted. She was almost delayed by this group of people! ”

She immediately stood up and walked to Lin Ze’s room.

The door of the room could not be opened. It must have been locked from the inside.

“Zhang Qingqing narrowed her eyes. Fortunately, she was prepared. ”

“In a moment, Zhang Qingqing took out a bunch of keys from her pocket. After she matched the room number, Zhang Qingqing opened the door from the outside and quietly walked in. ”

Lin Ze was sleeping on the bed.

His breathing was very shallow.

“There was no snoring, and there was no stench of feet in the room. He was as quiet as a prince. ”

“Thinking that she would be this man’s wife in the future, Zhang Qingqing was extremely excited and filled with a sense of superiority. ”

“At this moment, Lin Ze turned over on the bed. ”

“Zhang Qingqing was shocked. She held her breath, afraid that Lin Ze would wake up at this time. ”

“Fortunately, he didn’t. ”

It seemed that the effect of this medicine was pretty good.

“Because she was afraid that Lin Ze would hurt the child in her stomach, Zhang Qingqing didn’t give him any random medicine. Instead, she gave him a special medicine. After taking it, he would feel like he was drunk, and his limbs would ache, soon, he fell into a coma without any consciousness. ”

“Zhang Qingqing quietly walked to the side of the bed and lifted a corner of the quilt. Then, she took out a dagger and cut open her arm. Blood dripped onto the bedsheet. ”

A red plum blossom instantly bloomed on the bedsheet.

“Finally, Zhang Qingqing took out a bottle of spray and sprayed it in the air a few times. Soon, a strange smell filled the air. ”

“After doing all this, Zhang Qingqing threw the things into the trash can outside and returned to her room. She sat by the desk and wrote a note. ”

“After writing the note, Zhang Qingqing pressed the note on the bedside table, then closed the door and left. ”

“Before she left, Zhang Qingqing turned her head to look at Lin Ze, who was sleeping on the bed, and the corners of her lips curled up. ”

“The next morning, the strange smell in the room had not dissipated. ”

“When Lin Ze woke up, he felt that something was not right. ”

“But he could not remember what was wrong. Lin Ze pressed his temples, then began to get dressed and get ready to get up. ”

“Lifting the blanket, he looked at the blood on the bed and frowned. ”

Why was there blood on the bed?

“Just then, he saw the note on the bedside table: ”

“Lin Ze, thank you for a wonderful night. ”

“I know you didn’t mean it, it was just a drunken loss of control. ”

“Don’t worry, I won’t Pester You. ”

– Zhang Qingqing.

“Looking at the note, Lin Ze frowned. ”

What does Zhang Qingqing Mean?

Did something happen to them?

But why can’t he remember anything?

“But if nothing happened to them, what’s with the blood on the bed? What’s with the strange smell in the air? ”

Or is this Zhang Qingqing’s plan?

Lin Ze scratched his head in distress. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“At this moment, there was a knock on the door. ”

“Lin Ze put away the note and walked over to open the door. “Brother Ze, you’re awake!” ”

It was dog two.

Lin Ze nodded.

“”Ah Ze, have you seen Qingqing?”An Lizi walked over from behind. Perhaps due to her hangover, her expression was still a little ugly. ”

Lin Ze glanced at an Lizi and shook his head.

“An lizi asked curiously, “Then where did she go? I haven’t seen her since I woke up. Could she have gone back first?” ”

“”She must have gone back first,”dog two added. “She’s not a child anymore. Could she have run away?” ”

An Lizi nodded. “That’s true.”

“Lin Ze looked at his watch and continued, “What About Fat Tiger and Mozzie? Are they sober?” ”
