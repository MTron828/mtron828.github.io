“Old Mrs. Lin looked at Feng Qianhua apologetically. “Qianhua, Ah Ze has misunderstood you. Don’t blame him.” ”

“”Aunt Lin, look at what you’re saying. I’ve always treated Ah Ze as my own child. How can I blame him?”After saying that, Feng Qianhua continued, “Besides, that incident was my responsibility to begin with...” ”

Feng Qianhua looked guilty.

“It’s not your fault!”Old Mrs. Lin patted Feng Qianhua’s hand. “How Can It Be Your Fault? You mean well! Don’t say that again!”

“Feng Qianhua took out a beautiful gift box, “Oh right, Aunt Lin, the college entrance exam is coming up soon. This is a gift I specially prepared for Ah Ze. “As you know, Ah Ze doesn’t like me very much right now, so please pass it to him. Please don’t tell him that I bought this.” ”

“Old Madam Lin patted Feng Qianhua’s hand. “Qianhua, it’s been hard on you.” ”

“”Of course,”Feng Qianhua said with a smile. ”

“”By the way, why didn’t Xianxian come with you?”Old Madam Lin asked. ”

“Feng Qianhua smiled and said, “Isn’t the college entrance exam coming soon? That child is not as smart as Ah Ze. It’s said that stupid birds fly first, and she wants to get into a better school. Well, she’s studying at home now.” ”

“”Who said that Xianxian is not smart! If she’s not smart, can she get back first place?”Old Mrs. Lin continued, “But ah ZE, the college entrance exam is coming soon, and he didn’t even read a book! Sigh! This child!” ”

“Speaking up to this point, old Mrs. Lin Sighed. ”

“As the saying goes, without comparison, there’s no harm. ”

“Originally, she also thought that Lin Ze had been doing quite well recently, but when she heard Feng Qianhua say that Feng Xianxian was reading at home, Old Mrs. Lin’s heart became uneasy again. ”

“It was near the college entrance exam, and Feng Xianxian knew that she was reading at home, while Lin Ze went out to play ball! ”

“Feng Qianhua smiled and said, “AH ZE is gifted and intelligent. Even if he doesn’t read, he can still get good results!” ”

“”This child is smart, but he doesn’t put his mind on his studies,”old Mrs. Lin continued, “He definitely can’t beat Xianxian!” ”

“Of course, Lin Ze couldn’t beat Feng Xianxian! ”

“Feng Qianhua sneered in her heart, but she didn’t show it on her face. ”

“”Aunt Lin, studying isn’t the only way out now. Besides, Ah Ze is going to take over brother Jin Cheng’s position in the future. Whether he has a degree or not is no longer important to him. So, you don’t have to worry about this at all.” ”

“Old Madam Lin was even more upset. “In the past, when Jin Cheng went to school, his grades were very good. He always came first in his age. I wonder who this child looks like!” ”

Who does he look like?

Who else could he look like?

Feng Qianhua narrowed her eyes.

Of course he looks like ye Shu!

“If Lin Ze was born between her and Lin Jin Cheng, he definitely wouldn’t be like this! ”

What a pity.

Lin Ze had the bloodline of a lower class.

“Old Madam Lin also thought of ye Shu at this time. She waved her hand and said, “Forget it, forget it! Let’s not talk about this anymore!” ”

Talking about it would only cause more trouble!

...

Today was the 6th of June.

The day before the college entrance examination.

The atmosphere of study in the class had obviously changed.

“Everyone began to crazily add wechat, leave their contact details, take group photos, and write blessings... ”

Zhao Pingting quickly flipped through the answers to 53 and wrote three words on the last page.

Song ANBEI.

This was the name of the person she had always liked.

“The first time she saw him was at the military training ground. He was wearing an ugly camouflage uniform, but it caught her attention. ”

He was going to take the exam tomorrow.

He turned around in two different directions.

She didn’t know if she could meet him again in the future.

“Zhao pingting stared at the name for a long time before she suddenly looked up at Ye Zao. “Zao Zao, do you like anyone in school?”Zhao Pingting was suddenly very curious. Ye Zao was so beautiful.., which boy could catch her eye. ”

“”Ah?”Ye Zao was stunned at first, then shook her head. ”

“She had always been single in her previous life. In this life, she had never considered this question. ”

Perhaps she had experienced too much in her previous life.

Ye Zhuo was not particularly looking forward to love.

Zhao Pingting was not surprised to see this answer from ye Zhuo.

Because she really could not imagine who would be worthy of Ye Zhuo.

“You Do?”Ye Zhuo asked.

Zhao pingting nodded.

“Ye Zhuo asked curiously, “Who?” ”

“Zhao Pingting hesitated for a moment before continuing, “Song Anbei from the Rocket Class 3.” ”

Song Anbei?

She didn’t seem to have any impression of this person.

Ye Zhuo rubbed his chin. “Is he handsome?”
