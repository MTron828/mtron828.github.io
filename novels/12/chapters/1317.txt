Chapter 1318: 275: What a piece of trash! Zheng Wanyin’s face was swollen! 2

Translator: 549690339

Anyone who thought about it would know that this was not normal.

It was very abnormal!

“The assessment this time was not difficult. Otherwise, Zheng Wanyin would not have handed in her paper half an hour earlier. ”

The CEO narrowed his eyes. “Are you doubting the fairness of our assessment this time?”

“At that moment, there was a knock on the door. The CEO said, “Come in.” ”

Ling Yue walked in from outside. “Chief Executive.”

“Seeing Ling Yue, the chief executive’s expression softened. He continued, “Ling Yue, go back and rest first. As for the details, I’ll get su Pei to hand them over to you.” ”

Ling Yue nodded. “Okay.”

“Ling Yue turned around and walked out of the door, not forgetting to close the door. ”

“Zheng Wanyin looked up at the chief executive. “Chief executive, it’s not that I’m questioning the fairness of the assessment. It’s just that this assessment is unfair. I heard that even Bai Xiaosu got a 3a.” ”

How could someone like Bai Xiaosu get into 3A? Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“The CEO frowned. He had always thought highly of Zheng Wanyin, but this time, Zheng Wanyin’s performance had disappointed her. ”

“Everyone said that Bai Xiaosu had been ostracized and ostracized in the core group. At first, the CEO did not believe it. ”

But now it seemed...

This matter was most likely true.

The CEO could understand why others looked down on Bai Xiaosu and ridiculed him.

But who was Zheng Wanyin?

Zheng Wanyin was a subordinate that he thought highly of. He had high hopes for her.

But Zheng Wanyin said such a thing.

“The CEO looked up at Zheng Wanyin and spoke as gently as possible, “Bai Xiaosu got into triple A with his own ability and was promoted to the management level. “Zheng Wanyin, as I said earlier, it’s normal to make a mistake. If you don’t do well this time, try again next time. “You have to learn to find problems with yourself and not question the fairness of the assessment. “If every candidate is like you, then the assessment will lose its original meaning!” ”

ABA was an international alliance organization. There were international notaries at the scene of the assessment. There would definitely not be any cases of cheating and covering up.

Zheng Wanyin questioned the fairness of the assessment and even questioned the CEO’s personality.

“The CEO had been in this position for so many years, but this was the first time he had received such doubts. ”

Zheng Wanyin did not get the ideal result in her own assessment. Was it useful for her to complain now?

The CEO suppressed the dissatisfaction in his eyes.

“When she heard the CEO’s words, Zheng Wanyin’s face was filled with disbelief. ”

Looking for problems with herself?

What problems did she have?

“Every time she took the mock exam, she could get results above 2A. ”

“But this time, she only passed the 1A mark. ”

“If the exam questions this time were very difficult, it would be fine. ”

“But this time, the exam questions were not difficult at all. ”

“Even if one thought about it with their toes, they would know that this was very abnormal! ”

“The CEO made it sound so beautiful, but in fact, he was not protecting ye Zao. ”

Just because ye Zao was Cen Shaoqing’s girlfriend?

Disgusting!

It was simply disgusting.

“After the CEO finished his sentence, he felt that his words were a little harsh. He continued, “Zheng Wanyin, I can understand your current feelings, but if you didn’t get in, you didn’t get in. You are still young, there will be plenty of opportunities in the future! Go Back!” ”

Go back.

“What the CEO meant was, let her just let it go? ”

Let It Go?

Let It Go just like that? !

“When she heard this, Zheng Wanyin’s heart turned cold. She continued, “CEO, you have always been a fair and just existence in my heart. I believe that you will definitely uphold justice for me!” ”

Uphold Justice?

“When he heard this, the CEO was so angry that he laughed. “You didn’t do well in your exams, how Am I supposed to uphold justice for you? !” ”

It was a good thing that Zheng Wanyin said this.

“”I would like to take a look at Bai Xiaosu’s and my test papers,”Zheng Wanyin said. ”

The CEO frowned slightly. “You suspect that we swapped your and Bai Xiaosu’s test papers?”

It was a fantasy!

This was simply a fantasy!

How could they swapped the test papers and impersonate Bai Xiaosu?

Zheng Wanyin bowed to the CEO. “I was forced to do so. I just wanted to seek justice.”

The CEO massaged his temples. “Are you sure you want to see it?”

“”Yes, I’m sure.”Zheng Wanyin nodded. ”

“After the assessment competition ended, the examinees would not be able to see the test papers. ”

Ye Zhuo was probably aware of this as well. That was why he dared to brazenly swap out her and Bai Xiaosu’s test papers.

“The CEO continued, “Zheng Wanyin, I’ll say it again. There will never be any incidents of cheating or impersonating in our ABA. The test papers have already returned to the highest official. If you want to look at the test papers, you must report it. Once this report is submitted, it will directly affect whether you can continue to stay in the ABA!” ”
