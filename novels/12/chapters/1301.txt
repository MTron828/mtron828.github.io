Translator: 549690339

“Zheng wanyin said softly, “There’s no need to go through so much trouble. Mr. Carl isn’t an outsider. I can go pick him up myself.” ”

Xie wanqiu nodded with a smile. “Alright then.”

“Xie wanqiu originally thought that after she finished speaking, the others would be shocked beyond words. ”

That was Mr. Carl.

“However, there were no special emotions on everyone’s faces. ”

“Especially Old Mrs. Cen. Not only did she not have any special emotions, she even jogged to ye Zao’s side. “Yezi is here. Is It Cold Outside?” ”

“It’s alright.”Ye Zao held old Mrs. Cen’s hand in a somewhat intimate manner. “It’s not cold.”

“When he looked at Zhou Xiang again, he could only see ye Zao. ”

“It was fine if Bai Tang, this damn old woman, was like this. ”

Who Was Zhou Xiang?

Zheng Wanyin’s biological second aunt.

“Although the two of them were not related by blood, Zhou Xiang had watched Zheng Wanyin grow up. ”

“Logically speaking, they should be more intimate than their biological aunts and nephews. ”

But what about Zhou Xiang?

At least there was no distinction!

How long had Zhou Xiang known ye Zhuo?

One Year?

Two years?

“As Zheng Wanyin’s second aunt, Zhou Xiang actually did not care about Zheng Wanyin’s feelings at all. ”

Moreover.

Was Ye Zhuo Half as outstanding as Zheng Wanyin?

Zheng Wanyin and Mr. Carl were good friends!

Was Ye Zhuo Alright?

Zhou Xiang was a blind person!

She mistook the fish eye for a pearl.

What qualifications did she have to be Zheng Wanyin’s second aunt?

“Only Zheng Wanyin was a kind and good child. She was willing to call Zhou Xiang second aunt, and even called him so affectionately. ”

“Thinking of this, Xie Wanqiu’s eyes were filled with a cold light. ”

“Zheng Wanyin lowered her head slightly. Her tone was gentle, and there was a hint of envy in her voice. “Grandma, look at how beautiful my future cousin-in-law is. No wonder she managed to conquer someone as cold and aloof as my cousin!” ”

Cen Shaoqing had always been a cold and aloof existence.

Zheng Wanyin had never seen someone as cold and aloof as Cen Shaoqing in her entire life.

This kind of coldness kept people at a distance of a thousand miles.

“But in front of ye Zhuo, that kind of distance seemed to disappear into thin air. Damn ” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“”Beautiful? What’s the use of being beautiful!”Xie wanqiu snorted. “No matter how beautiful you are, you’re just a piece of skin!” ”

“Zheng wanyin smiled and said, “That’s not true. Actually, being good-looking is also an advantage. If I could grow up to be like my cousin-in-law, I’m afraid I would wake up from my dreams laughing.” ”

“No matter when, beauty was the best weapon. ”

Unfortunately.

There were no natural beauties in this world.

Zheng Wanyin had always known this truth.

“Therefore, over the years, she had been fine-tuning her appearance, which resulted in her current appearance. ”

“With Ye Zhuo’s appearance, he should have been in and out of the hospital many times, right? ”

Zheng Wanyin touched her face and felt that she still lacked perseverance.

“Skinning, bone cutting, chin pad, nose augmentation, breast augmentation, and eye opening all required a lot of risks. ”

Especially eye opening.

“If the surgery was not done properly, it would aggravate the risk of blindness. ”

“Regardless of the risks, the surgery was still very painful. ”

“At the end of last year, Zheng Wanyin went for a bone cutting. ”

She had shaved her cheekbones.

“Because it was a face surgery, she could not have general anesthesia. She knew the procedure very well. The doctor first removed the partial skin of the face and then used tools to Polish it. ”

It was so painful that she could not breathe.

“Even though a year had passed, Zheng Wanyin could still dream about that scene when she occasionally had a dream in the middle of the night. ”

She was so scared that she broke out in cold sweat. She was glad that she was not on the operating bed.

Ye Zao was so beautiful. He must have had all the surgery done on his body.

Amazing.

He was really amazing.

“Zheng Wanyin was filled with admiration. She only had to perform two small surgeries, cutting the bone and opening the corner of her eyes. She already felt that it was terrifying. She did not know how someone like Ye Zao, who had moved his entire body, managed to persevere. ”

If only she had the perseverance and perseverance of ye Zao.

It was not without reason that ye Zao was able to make Cen Shaoqing see him in a new light.

“At this moment, Cen Shaoqing brought ye Zao into the house. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen immediately said, “Zao Zao, this is Shaoqing’s grandmother, Old Mrs. Zhou. This is old Mrs. Zhou’s granddaughter, Zheng Wanyin. Wanyin is about the same age as you. You can just call her cousin.” ”

“Although Old Mrs. Cen did not like Xie wanqiu, this person was, after all, Cen Shaoqing’s grandmother. ”

It was time to leave.

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said politely, “Grandma, Wanyin’s cousin.” ”

“Although ye Zhuo was a few years younger than Zheng Wanyin, Cen Shaoqing was Zheng Wanyin’s cousin. ”

“Therefore, according to seniority, Ye Zhuo had to call Zheng Wanyin’s cousin. ”

“Xie wanqiu smiled as she held ye Zao’s hand, “This must be Zao Zao! I’ve heard Shaoqing’s grandmother mention you a long time ago. She said that you’re a little girl that everyone loves. Now that I’ve seen you, you’re indeed adorable! Shaoqing has a good eye!” ”
