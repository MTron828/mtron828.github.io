“If Shen Linlin did not love Sun Yu, she would come to look for Sun Yu again and again. Did she want to throw herself at her? ”

“Really?”Sun Yu said.

“”Of course it’s true!”Mother Sun nodded, she said with a firm face, “I’m also a woman, and I know Women Better Than You! Believe me, as long as you apologize to her and put in enough effort on the surface, she will definitely reconcile with you!”Even if Shen Linlin could not help Sun Yuzhong return to the base, sun Yu had a girlfriend who worked at the CEN group base. It was enough for her to brag in front of others. ”

“After listening to Mother Sun’s words, Sun Yu found some comfort. She perked up and said, “I’ll go look for her now!” ”

Mother was right. Shen Linlin definitely still had her in her heart.

“If he took the initiative to look for Shen Linlin, Shen Linlin would definitely be very happy. ”

“”Remember to buy a bunch of flowers to bring with you,”mother Sun said. ”

“I know.”Sun Yu nodded.

Sun Yu came to the flower shop and bought a bunch of flowers. She stood at the intersection that Shen Linlin had to pass when she got off work and waited for her.

“An hour later, she finally saw Shen Linlin’s figure. ”

“Sun Yu immediately trotted over to Shen Linlin. “Linlin, you’re off work. I came specially to pick you up.” ”

Shen Linlin acted as if she did not see Sun Yu and took a detour to walk away.

“Sun Yu panicked and immediately caught up to Shen Linlin, blocking her way, “Linlin! Other than coming to pick you up, I also want to apologize to you. I’m sorry, I was wrong. It was all my fault a few days ago. I shouldn’t have treated you like that! Please forgive me!” ”

“Only then did Shen Linlin speak. “Sun Yu, we’ve already broken up. I’ve thought a lot these few days. We’re really not suitable for each other, be it in terms of character or outlook. From now on, let’s just go our separate ways.” ”

“”Linlin, don’t be like this. I really know my mistake!”Sun Yu continued, “Please forgive me!” ”

“Shen Linlin looked at Sun Yu. “You only knew to look for me after being expelled from the base. Sun Yu, do you really think I’m an idiot? It’s too late to say sorry now!” ”

Shen Linlin was not the kind of idiot who was used by others.

“After experiencing this, she had also seen clearly what kind of person Sun Yu was. ”

It was pretty good.

Finding out now was better than finding out after they got married.

“”Linlin!”Sun Yu immediately knelt on the ground. “Linlin, please forgive me. If you don’t forgive me, I’ll kneel on the ground and never get up!” ”

“”Then you’ll kneel on the ground forever!”After saying that, Shen Linlin turned around and left. ”

“Seeing that Shen Linlin had no intention of turning back, Sun Yu immediately caught up with Shen Linlin. “Linlin, what do you want me to do to make you forgive me? As long as you say it, I can do it!” ”

“”Sun Yu, I’ll say it again. We’ve already broken up! From now on, you go your way and I’ll go my way!” ”

“Linlin!”Sun Yu reached out and grabbed Shen Linlin’s wrist.

“Let go of me!”Shen Linlin frowned tightly.

Sun Yu’s strength was too great. She couldn’t break free at all. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“”No! If you don’t forgive me, I won’t Let Go!”Sun Yu said as she hugged Shen Linlin. “Linlin, just forgive me! Linlin!” ”

“Shen Linlin was a girl. This girl’s strength was inferior to that of a man. Moreover, Sun Yu was being a scoundrel. ”

“At this moment, Shen Linlin suddenly saw a familiar figure and shouted, “Mr. He! Over Here!” ”

The man immediately turned around and jogged over. “Miss Shen!”

“Shen Linlin continued, “Mr. HE, quickly save me. This person is being a scoundrel!” ”

“When he was tall and strong, nearly 185 centimeters in height. He was more than half a head taller than Sun Yu, who was 172 centimeters tall. He walked over and pulled lightly, separating the two of them. ”

Shen Linlin immediately hid behind when he.

“Sun Yu said, “Who are you? Why do you usually interfere in the matters between me and my girlfriend?” ”

When he turned to look at Shen Linlin.

“Shen Linlin said, “He’s my ex-boyfriend.” ”

Ex-boyfriend?

“When he looked at Sun Yu up and down when he heard this. Finally, he said, “Your taste is really bad.” ”

“When he looked up at Sun Yu after he said this, “Mr. Sun, right? I’m Miss Shen’s blind date. My surname is he.” ”

“When she heard this, Sun Yu was furious. She scolded, “Shen Linlin, you B * TCH. You’ve only broken up with me for a few days and you can’t stand the loneliness and want to find a man. I...” ”

“At this moment, when did she open her mouth again and took out a recording pen, “Mr. Sun Yu, I forgot to introduce myself just now. I’m a lawyer. Please be careful with your words and actions. Otherwise, my future girlfriend has the right to appeal to you.”. Attacking, insulting, and slandering others already constituted a crime. According to Article 246 of the criminal law, if the circumstances are serious, the penalty is up to three years of fixed-term imprisonment, criminal detention, control, or deprivation of political rights!” ”
