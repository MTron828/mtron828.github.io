It was very similar to the superhuman he saw in sci-fi movies.

He wanted to kill Lin Ze with his own hands!

“Lin Ze also noticed the changes in Chen Yaosheng. He frowned slightly, tightened his grip on the drum stick, and prepared himself to defend against the enemy. ”

Bang!

“At this moment, Chen Yaosheng threw a punch. ”

Lin Ze dodged backward and avoided the punch just like that.

“Chen Yaosheng attacked again, pressing forward step by step. The steel armor had made his reaction speed much faster. ”

Lin Ze countered every move.

“Seeing that Lin Ze was not a match for Chen Yaosheng, Bai Jingshu shouted, “Mr. Lin, run! Don’t worry about me!” ”

Lin Ze acted as if he did not hear her.

“Chen Yaosheng followed up with a flying kick and kicked Lin Ze in the stomach, sending him flying into the air. ”

Bang!

Lin Ze was like a kite with a broken string. He was thrown onto the wall and spat out a mouthful of blood.

It looked a little tragic.

Bai Jingshu blamed herself and tears fell like rain. She had let Lin Ze down.

What should she do now?

There was only one way in front of Bai Jingshu.

That was to beg Chen Yaosheng not to hurt Lin Ze.

“”Stop! Chen Yaosheng, Stop!” ”

“Who do you think you are?”Chen Yaosheng turned to look at Bai Jingshu.

“Bai Jingshu cried, “Chen Yaosheng, this is just a grudge between us. There’s no need to drag innocent people into this. I’ll agree to whatever you want! Please let him go!” ”

“Hearing this, the corners of Chen Yaosheng’s mouth curled up. His eyes were filled with disdain. “Only now do you want to admit defeat? I’m telling you, it’s Too Late!” ”

No one had ever dared to disfigure Chen Yaosheng.

Being injured by an ordinary person like Lin Ze was a humiliation to Chen Yaosheng.

“In the S Galaxy, no one had ever been disfigured by an earthling. ”

“After saying this, Chen Yaosheng directly slapped Lin Ze’s head. ”

This slap could be fatal.

“Mr. Lin!”

“Bai Jingshu cried out in pain, and her facial features lost control. ”

Lin Ze narrowed his eyes as he looked at the falling palm.

Was he really going to lose his life just like that?

No.

Lin Ze tightened his grip on the drum stick in his hand and used the strength of a survivor!

“Even if it was really like hitting a rock with an egg, he still wanted to give it a try! ”

Bang!

“After a loud bang, Chen Yaosheng fell to the ground. ”

Lin Ze held the drum stick in his right hand and covered his chest with his left hand as he stood up from the ground.

Bai Jingshu slowly opened her eyes. This was what she saw.

Her eyes were filled with disbelief.

Nothing.

Lin Ze was actually fine.

“At this moment, there were only two words in Bai Jingshu’s mind. ”

A desperate counterattack!

“Then, she saw that the person on the ground was actually Chen Yaosheng. ” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Chen Yaosheng’s face was also filled with disbelief.

He had never dreamed that he would be defeated by a low-level earthling.

“Chen Yaosheng felt that the power of his steel armor was slowly dissipating until it disappeared without a trace. The steel armor disappeared, and soon, he returned to his original appearance. ”

The only difference was that his body was covered in wounds.

“Lin Ze dragged his heavy steps and walked to Bai Jingshu. He reached out his hand and said, “Let’s go.” ”

“Looking at the hand in front of her, Bai Jingshu did not know what to feel. ”

She was overwhelmed with emotion.

She had never felt so shocked by anyone before.

“He was standing right in front of her. Behind him was a boundless light, giving her hope. ”

“Seeing that Bai Jingshu did not move for a long time, Lin ze continued, “You can’t Move?” ”

“”Yes,”Bai Jingshu replied. ”

She really could not move now. It was as if all her strength had been sucked out of her. She felt very uncomfortable.

Smack.

Lin Ze threw the drum stick on the ground and bent down slightly to pick Bai Jingshu up.

“Before Bai Jingshu could react, she had already been lifted into the air. From her angle, she could see Lin Ze’s lower jaw. ”

He was very thin.

“However, his arms and arms were firm and strong, giving her an endless sense of security. ”

Bai Jingshu could clearly hear his heartbeat.

“It was as if it was contagious. At this moment, Bai Jingshu’s heartbeat was also speeding up. ”

“Just as she was about to leave the house, Bai Jingshu suddenly thought of something and said, “Wait a moment.” ”

Lin Ze stopped in his tracks. “What’s Wrong?”

“What about him?”Bai Jingshu asked.

He was naturally referring to Chen Yaosheng.

Lin Ze continued to walk out. “Someone will come and clear the area later.”

“Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded.

Lin Ze carried Bai Jingshu and walked all the way out of the house.

His car was parked outside.
