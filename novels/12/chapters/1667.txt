“Chapter 1668: 349: you, Miss Ye, or you, Miss Ye! 5”

Translator: 549690339

Professor Feng shook his head.

“After studying Europa for so many years, professor Feng had indeed never seen any danger on Europa. This was also the reason why she was puzzled by Ye Zhuo’s refusal to let them land on Europa. ”

“”Then it’s fine!”Director ma smiled and said, “Let’s set the landing point here! Moreover, we have an aircraft carrier. The supply system of an aircraft carrier is the best in the world. Even if there is really any danger, we don’t have to worry!” ”

“”Okay.”Professor Feng nodded. Then, he said, “Do we really not have to report the situation on Mars to master five?” ”

“If he didn’t say it, professor Feng would feel a little uneasy. ”

“But if she was asked to say it, she felt unwilling. In short, it was very difficult. ”

“Just like director Ma, she wanted to board Europa even in her dreams. Europa was her lifelong dream! ”

“However, with ye Zao around, it was impossible to ascend to Europa! ”

“This time, Ye Zao’s accident on Mars was a very good opportunity for them. ”

“”Why are you so wishy-washy?”Director Ma was a little impatient. He stood up and said, “If you want to tell Master Five, you can go now! I absolutely won’t Stop You! Just don’t regret it!” ”

“Professor Feng quickly stood up and explained, “Director Ma, I didn’t mean it that way. You’ve Misunderstood Me!” ”

“Director ma glanced at Professor Feng. “Since you didn’t mean it that way, then just pretend that nothing happened and wait for the result quietly!” ”

“Yes.”Professor Feng nodded. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“In fact, there was no need to wait for the result. ”

Ye Zhuo was definitely doomed now.

“Ma Fangfei was not the kind of child who did not know her limits. If the situation was not critical, she would never have told director Ma about this matter. ”

On the other side.

“Just as Cen Jiang was preparing everything and starting the aircraft to set off, a cry of surprise suddenly came from the communicator, “Look, what is that?” ”

A small black dot was flying over from the side of the rolling magma.

“As the Black Dot got closer and closer, they could vaguely make out the appearance of the spacecraft. ”

Spacecraft!

“On Mars, other than them and Ye Zhuo, there was no other spacecraft. ”

“If this spacecraft was not an alien creature, it must be ye Zhuo. ”

“Cen he kept adjusting the focus of the telescope. Finally, a smile appeared on his taut face. “Miss Ye! It’s Miss Ye’s spacecraft! Miss ye is back!” ”

“”Quick, let me take a look at the telescope!”Cen Hu snatched the telescope from CEN he’s hand. ”

“Seeing the flying device becoming clearer and clearer on the telescope, Cen Hu was so excited that he was about to cry. ”

It was indeed ye Zao’s flying device.

No one could understand what he was feeling right now.

Only Ma Fangfei and the others excitedly waved at the flying device. “Miss Ye! Miss Ye!”

“Cen Jiang, who was sitting in the aircraft, looked up and indeed saw ye Zao’s spaceship. ”

Cen Jiang quickly set up a flight path to return to the aircraft carrier runway.

Rumble —

Cen Jiang had just stopped when ye Zao’s aircraft steadily stopped beside him.

“Miss Ye!”Everyone immediately surrounded ye Zao.

Ye Zao pushed open the cabin door and looked at everyone. His jade-like face was full of confusion. “What happened to you guys?”

“”Sob, sob, sob...”Ma Fangfei hugged ye Zao and cried. “There was a huge explosion in the northwest region. We thought, thought...”Ma Fangfei could not say the rest of her words. ”

Ye Zao chuckled. “You thought something happened to me?”

“Yes.”Ma Fangfei nodded.

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Don’t worry, I’m Fine.” ”

“In fact, it was just a little bit. Ye Zao had almost brushed past the grim reaper. ”

“She had always been used to reporting good news but not bad news. Since she was fine, there was no need for everyone to be nervous. ”

“Ma fangfei sighed and said, “As expected, Miss Ye is still Miss Ye!”If it were anyone else, under such circumstances, they would probably have been in trouble long ago! ”

“”Oh right,”ye Zao continued, “How are the collection of your samples coming along?” ”

“Ma fangfei said, “Almost all of them have been collected.” ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Alright. Then we can go back after making some preparations.”

“With Ye Zhuo’s return, the atmosphere in the aircraft carrier returned to normal. Everyone was chatting and laughing, and it was very harmonious. ”

An hour later.

Professor Feng and director Ma were analyzing the situation on the Europa as they walked out.

Bang!

“At this moment, a person ran in from outside and collided head-on with director Ma. ”

“Director Ma was caught off guard and almost fell to the ground. Fortunately, Professor Feng reached out to hold him in time. ”
