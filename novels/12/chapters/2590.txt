Zhou Cuihua did not expect this to be the result of her visit to the Lin family.

“She thought that Lin Qingxuan would stop Xia Xiaoman’s behavior, but she did not expect Lin Qingxuan to have no reaction at all. He even asked her to bring the wine back! ”

This was more or less an insult!

“”Mom, what do you think is going on with this rich businessman?”Li hang was very curious now. ” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Lin Qingxuan was already 50 years old. It was one thing for a second-marriage man to not have children, but after marrying Xia Xiaoman, he was still so obedient to Xia Xiaoman. ”

Li hang was even wondering if Xia Xiaoman had bewitched Lin Qingxuan!

Zhou Cuihua was also very speechless now. “Who knows what’s Going On!”

Everything was different from what she had imagined.

“At this moment, Li Hang seemed to have thought of something and continued, “Mom, under what circumstances would a man not have children after being married for so many years? Especially when this man is a wealthy businessman.” ”

“Even an ordinary family knew the importance of having an heir, let alone a wealthy businessman with millions in assets? ”

Were wealthy businessmen not afraid of having no heirs?

“Therefore, Lin Qingxuan and Xia Xiaoman felt that it was strange no matter how they looked at it. ”

“Hearing this, Zhou Cuihua narrowed her eyes and continued, “Either a man can’t give birth, or a woman can’t give birth.” ”

“”But Lin Qingxuan is a rich businessman after all. If he really can’t give birth, then where did the child between him and Xia Xiaoman come from?”? “If his ex-wife can’t give birth, then why would the two of them suddenly divorce after so many years?” ”

“Li hang paused and continued, “And no successful man would tolerate his wife not giving birth, right?” ”

“If Lin Qingxuan’s ex-wife really couldn’t give birth, Lin Qingxuan wouldn’t have lived with her for so many years. ”

“Hearing this, Zhou Cuihua was enlightened. She looked at Li hang and said, “So Hang, you’re saying that there’s something wrong with the rich businessmen?” ”

“Li Hang said uncertainly, “I’m not sure either. But according to normal reasoning, it should be like this.” ”

“If the person with a problem was Lin Qingxuan, then the person with the biggest problem was Xia Xiaoman. ”

“Thinking of this.., li hang continued, “We can’t rule out the possibility that Xia Xiaoman is a mother relying on her son. She was the rich businessman’s mistress in the past. The rich businessman wanted to have a child for many years. Xia Xiaoman suddenly became pregnant. The rich businessman must be very happy, so he immediately divorced his ex-wife and married Xia Xiaoman.” ”

“”Right, right, right! You’re right! It must be like this!”Zhou Cuihua agreed with Li Hang’s words. ”

“If it wasn’t for the fact that the mother was a mistress who relied on her son, what right did Xia Xiaoman have to marry into a rich family? ”

“Zhou cuihua continued, “The Xia family is also not a good family. They actually produced such an immoral thing like Xia Xiaoman! What’s wrong with being a mistress?” ”

How disgusting!

Zhou cuihua could not wait to announce this result to the world.

She wanted to let everyone know that Xia Xiaoman was a shameless mistress.

“”Mom, you’re focusing on the wrong place,”Li Hang said. ”

“Zhou Cuihua was stunned for a moment and did not react. She continued, “What do you mean?” ”

“Li hang continued, “Mom, you’re not surprised at all. Why did the rich businessman and his ex-wife never get pregnant? Did they get pregnant with Xia Xiaoman so quickly?” ”

“This sentence was like waking up the person in the dream, and it instantly enlightened Zhou cuihua. ”

“Zhou cuihua, who came back to her senses, covered her mouth and said incredulously, “Oh my God! Oh My God! Xia Xiaoman is too bold!” ”

“After saying that, Zhou cuihua continued, “So who’s the bastard now?” ”

“Li hang shook his head, “I’m just guessing.” ”

“”No, no, no, this isn’t just a guess!”Zhou cuihua said, “I think it’s most likely true! Otherwise, why didn’t the rich businessman have any other children before? He had a child with Xia Xiaoman all of a sudden! Xia Xiaoman is too bold!” ”

“If it were anyone else, who would dare to do such a thing? ”

Perhaps only the television would dare to do such a thing?

“Li hang said, “Actually, I didn’t expect it either.” ”

“After all, before the incident with an Dongliang, Xia Xiaoman was just an ordinary rural woman in her eyes. ”

“Moreover, she did not care about her appearance and had a dusty face all day long. ”

Who would have thought that she would turn out like this!

“The corners of Zhou Cuihua’s mouth curled up into a smile as she continued, “Hang Hang, do you think that Xia Xiaoman and an Lizi, these old B * tches and B * tches, would still be living their lives if the wealthy businessmen knew about this?” ”
