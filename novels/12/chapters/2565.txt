“”Linda, you don’t have to go through so much trouble,”Vivi said. ”

“It’s not a problem. It’s decided.”Linda asked Vivi some more questions before she turned around and left.

“After Linda left, Vivi sat at the computer desk and began to draw. ”

Only Vivi who was immersed in the comic world was the happiest.

It was as if she had become a character in the comic.

Her emotions would be affected by the plot of the comic.

“Sometimes she would frown, sometimes she would smile. ”

“Liu Meilian originally wanted to use public opinion to make the hospital pay, but she didn’t expect things to turn out like this. ”

“Not only did she not get a single cent, but she was also scolded. ”

“”This little B * Tch!”Liu Meilian was so angry that she cursed, “I shouldn’t have given birth to her back then! I should have strangled her to death!” ”

Zhou Si watched Liu Meilian from the side and felt that such a mother was terrifying.

Zhou Zhe also stared at Liu Meilian with his mouth agape.

The trajectory of their lives had already undergone a qualitative change from this moment on.

They were being taught by their own words.

“After all, parents were the best teachers for their children. ”

...

On the other side.

The Lin family.

“Although Bai Jingshu didn’t have any reaction during the early stages of pregnancy, she had been reacting badly recently. ”

She couldn’t eat anything.

“Her face was sallow and sallow, as if she had aged more than ten years. ”

“Ye Shu was very anxious. “I wasn’t like this when I was pregnant with Ah Ze and burning! Jingshu, should we go to the hospital to have a look?” ”

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “Mom, I’m really fine. The Doctor said that this is all normal.” ”

“”But your face is really too ugly!”Ye Shu continued, “Don’t ruin your body because of pregnancy!” ”

“”Mom, I know my own body. Don’t worry, I’m really fine!” ”

Ye Zao was still a little worried. “Zao Zao has been too busy these few days. He hasn’t been home for a long time. Why don’t I let Zao Zao Show You?”

“”Mom, did you miss me?”As soon as she said this, ye Zao walked in from outside. ” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Ye Shu thought that she was hallucinating. When she turned around, she saw ye Zao and said in surprise, “Zao Zao!” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Mom, sister-in-law.” ”

“Zao Zao.”

Ye Shu immediately grabbed ye Zao’s hand and looked up and down. She looked left and right. “You’ve lost weight!”

“”Mom, I haven’t been home for a week. How can it be as exaggerated as you say? You’ve lost weight already?”Ye Zao turned to look at Bai Jingshu and said in surprise, “Sister-in-law, why do you look so pale?” ”

“Ye Shu said, “Quick, let your sister-in-law take a look. Her reaction has been very strong recently. She can’t eat anything and her feet are swollen.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“After saying that, Ye Zhuo checked Bai Jingshu’s pulse. ”

“A moment later, she let go of Bai Jingshu’s wrist and said, “Mom, don’t worry. This is a normal pregnancy reaction. She’ll be fine after a while.” ”

“”I already said that I’m fine, but mom still doesn’t believe me!”Bai Jingshu smiled at Ye Shu. “You Believe me now, right?” ”

“Ye Shu continued, “Then is there any way to improve it? If this continues, how can the adult’s body endure it?” ”

“Ever since Bai Jingshu married into the Lin family, ye Shu had always treated her as her own daughter. Seeing how Bai Jingshu had worked so hard, Ye Shu, as her mother, saw it and felt pain in her heart. ”

“Ye Zhuo said, “It’s just that the medicine is poisonous. How about this? I’ll give sister-in-law a few injections. It should be able to improve the situation.” ”

“”Okay, okay, okay.”Ye Shu immediately nodded. “Then I’ll get someone to prepare the acupuncture room now.” ”

“Okay.”

Ye Shu went to the acupuncture room.

Ye Zhuo chatted with Bai Jingshu.

“”Sister-in-law, have you and my brother named the Baby Yet?” ”

Bai Jingshu shook her head. “Your brother and I have always decided to let you name the baby.”

“Let me name it?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“”Yes.”Bai Jingshu said, “Your brother and I are both useless at naming names. Zhuo Zhuo, give your future niece and nephew a name.” ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Sister-in-law, naming should be your forte. I’m the real useless at naming names.”Bai Jingshu was a historical writer who dabbled in literature, so she should be good at this aspect. ”

“Bai Jingshu immediately shook her head. “No, no, no. I really don’t know how to name names. Every time I name a character in a virtual reality, it gives me a headache. Zao Zao, I’ll leave the matter of naming to you. When the time comes, I’ll get your brother to give you a big red packet!” ”

“She was really useless at naming names. She was not modest at all. She had once used the north, south, east, west, and north to name characters. ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Since sister-in-law says so, then I’ll have to think about it carefully.” ”
