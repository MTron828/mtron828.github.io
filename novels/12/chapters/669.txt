“Feng Xianxian had fawned over Old Lady Lin for so many years, and no one knew her better than she did. ”

“Feng Qianhua suddenly thought of someone. She quickly stood up from the ground, took out her cell phone, found a contact in her address book, and made a call. ”

“An hour later, Feng Xianxian appeared at the police station and saw Feng Qianhua, who was being detained. ”

“Although it had only been a few hours, Feng Qianhua seemed to have aged more than ten years. ”

“Mom!”

“Seeing Feng Qianhua like this, Feng Xianxian’s heart tightened. ”

“The Feng Qianhua in her eyes had always been bright and beautiful, high and mighty. When had she ever been so down and out? ”

“”Xianxian, I’m sorry...”seeing Feng Xianxian, Feng Qianhua’s face was full of tears. ”

She thought that she could give Feng Xianxian a bright future.

She didn’t expect that she would drag Feng Xianxian down in the end.

“Feng Xianxian asked with red eyes, “Mom, what happened?” ”

Feng Qianhua looked at the wound on Feng Xianxian’s face. “Did that old woman hit you?”

“Yes.”Feng Xianxian nodded.

“Hearing that, Feng Qianhua felt even more guilty. “Xianxian, I’m sorry. It’s all Mom’s fault for dragging you down...” ”

“If she had been a little more ruthless back then, she would not have left so many problems behind. ”

Feng Qianhua felt both regret and guilt at the same time.

She felt very uncomfortable.

“Feng Qianxian narrowed her eyes. “Mother, now is not the time to be sad. We don’t have much time left. Tell me first, what’s going on! have those things been discovered?” ”

She had to know the reason before she could think of a way to solve it.

Feng Qianhua nodded and told her what happened.

Feng Qianqian frowned deeply when she heard that.

She thought that the Lin family had found out that Feng Qianhua had swapped out ye Zao nineteen years ago. She did not expect that the truth about Lin Jin city’s car accident and the secret of the health soup had been discovered!

It seemed that the matter was indeed a little tricky.

“Seeing that visiting hours were about to end, Feng Qianqian continued, “Mom, take good care of yourself inside. Don’t worry about me. I’ll think of a way to come and see you again when I have time!” ”

“Feng Qianhua nodded and said in a raspy voice, “Qianqian, you have to take good care of yourself on your own. If the Feng family bullies you, you have to bear with it and calm down for a while.” ”

The person Feng Qianhua was most worried about was Feng Xianxian.

She was afraid that the Feng family would make things difficult for Feng Xianxian if something happened to her.

“Feng Xianxian was beautiful and had excellent grades. In their eyes, she was a very good tool for marriage. ”

“Moreover, Feng Xianxian and old madam Feng were not related by blood. In order to achieve her goal, old madam Feng would do almost anything. ”

“After saying that, Feng Qianhua continued, “Xianxian, if it’s possible, think of a way to sever ties with the Feng family and leave the Feng family forever.” ”

“Now, she had completely fallen out with old madam Lin. ”

“Feng Xianxian had no backing. If she continued to stay in the Feng family, only death awaited her. ”

Leaving the Feng family was the best choice.

“Feng Xianxian raised her head to look at Feng Qianhua. “Mom, I know what to do! Don’t worry, I will take good care of myself.” ”

“Since things had come to this point, retreating would not solve any problems. ”

The best way to solve the problem was to face it head-on.

“As long as she did not lower her head, no one could make her lower her head! ”

Feng Qianqian clenched her fists.

“After leaving the police station, Feng Qianqian did not return to the Feng family. Instead, she went to the hospital. ”

The Lin family’s bodyguards stood in front of the ward and did not allow Feng Qianqian to enter.

“Feng Qianqian knelt on the ground and knelt in front of old lady Lin’s ward. “Grandma, I beg you to meet me!” ”

“Get lost!”

Old Lady Lin’s voice came from inside.

“Feng Xianxian continued, “I beg you to meet me and let me explain things clearly. When the time comes, if you ask me to get lost again, I will definitely not say another word! If you don’t agree with me, I will never be able to get up from my knees!” ”

Old Lady Lin did not say another word.

Feng Xianxian did not get up either.

...

On the other side.

At the Lin family manor.

“After settling the matter from nineteen years ago, the dark clouds hanging over the Lin family disappeared. ”

Lin Jincheng rolled up his sleeves. “I’m happy today. I’ll Cook Tonight! What do you three want to eat? I’ll Cook.”

“You Can Cook?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly.

Lin Ze hugged brother Meow and looked up at Lin Jincheng.

“After living with Lin Jincheng for so many years, he had never known that Lin Jincheng could cook. ”
