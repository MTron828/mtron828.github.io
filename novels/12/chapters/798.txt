“Chapter 799: 176: Old Mrs. Lin’s retribution, the burning began to torture the dregs! 3”

Translator: 549690339

Gao Di said that the effect of the medicine would take 10-24 hours to take effect.

“If the medicine was fine, even if old Mrs. Lin was fine now, she wouldn’t be able to hold on for long.”

She would just wait a little longer.

“Thinking of this, Feng Xianxian narrowed her eyes and turned to walk in the direction of the restaurant.”

“Soon, Feng Xianxian had prepared three dishes and a soup and asked Old Lady Lin to come out for dinner.”

“Old Lady Lin walked out of the bedroom. Before she reached the dining hall, she felt her head heavy and her legs light up. Her vision went black and she fell to the ground.”

Bang —

The Loud Sound gave Feng Xianxian a fright.

Feng Xianxian turned her head and saw that Old Lady Lin had fallen to the ground.

The effects of the medicine had taken effect!

“However, in order to ensure that nothing went wrong, Feng Xianxian did not immediately reveal her true thoughts. She immediately walked to Old Lady Lin’s side and asked with concern, “Grandma, Are You Alright? Let me help you up.””

“Seeing Feng Xianxian running over anxiously, Old Lady Lin’s eyes turned red.”

She had not seen the wrong person.

She had not seen the wrong person.

Her fall this time had nothing to do with Feng Xianxian. It was just an accident!

Feng Xianxian helped Old Lady Lin Stand Up.

“But at this moment, Old Lady Lin’s limbs were stiff and her mouth and eyes were slanted. She couldn’t even speak a complete sentence, so how could she stand up?”

It was also at this moment that Feng Xianxian dared to confirm that the drug was really acting up.

Gao Di didn’t lie to her.

This medicine could really cause a person to suffer a stroke! 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Thinking of this, Feng Xianxian was ecstatic.”

Good!

This was really great!

“”Mom, I’ve Avenged You,”Feng Xianxian said with trembling lips, unable to hold back her tears.”

“Although Old Lady Lin had suffered a stroke, her consciousness was still clear.”

“Hearing this, her eyes were filled with shock.”

No.

It couldn’t be.

“Feng Xianxian wouldn’t harm her. Old Lady Lin looked at Feng Xianxian and tried her best to utter a broken syllable, “Xianxian, Xianxian, save, save, save...””

Feng Xianxian looked down at Old Lady Lin with a smile on her lips. “Do you want to Say Save You?”

“Old Lady Lin’s eyes were wide open, filled with panic and disbelief.”

How could this be?

She was so good to Feng Xianxian.

Why did Feng Xianxian want to harm her?

Why?

“”Old Woman, let me tell you, no one can save you now!”At this moment, Feng Xianxian was so unfamiliar that she was like a different person. She had removed all her disguises, “From the moment you personally sent my mother to prison, you should have thought of today! Let me tell you, I actually know that my mother poisoned you! I even helped my mother boil the medicine! I’ve been waiting for this moment! The heavens have eyes, retribution is not pleasant! Old Woman! I finally saw you get your retribution with my own eyes!””

“In order to please Old Lady Lin, Feng Xianxian had disguised herself for far too long.”

“At this moment, she no longer wanted to disguise herself.”

“Throughout the whole process, Old Lady Lin just looked at Feng Xianxian, her eyes filled with sadness.”

She really thought of Feng Xianxian as her biological granddaughter.

“Otherwise, she would not have believed in Feng Xianxian after what happened this morning.”

“She thought that if she thought of Feng Xianxian as her biological granddaughter, Feng Xianxian would also think of her as her biological grandmother.”

But she was wrong.

She was really wrong.

Feng Xianxian was a poisonous snake that could bite people.

Everyone else could see Feng Xianxian’s true face.

Only she.

“Only her old eyes were dim, and she was deceived by this poisonous snake.”

Old Lady Lin never dreamed of today.

“Feng Xianxian continued, “Old Lady, do you want to know why you suddenly had a stroke?””

“At this point, Feng Xianxian paused. “Because of the cup of red date water last night.””

Red date water.

It was indeed the cup of red date water.

“If not for the fact that the pain in her body had not completely disappeared, Old Lady Lin would have thought that she was dreaming.”

She wished that this was a dream!

She could not believe that this was real.

A granddaughter that she had doted on for twenty years would actually harm her.

“For Feng Xianxian, Old Lady Lin had even turned against her own son, grandson, and granddaughter.”

“In the end, she ended up like this.”

Retribution!

Feng Xianxian was right.

This was retribution!

A hot tear fell from the corner of Old Lady Lin’s eyes.

She regretted it.

She really regretted it.

She regretted not listening to what Lin Jincheng and the others said.

She regretted not recognizing people clearly.

She made the people who were really good to her heart cold.

Raising a tiger as a threat.

Eating the consequences.

“After saying this, Feng Xianxian stood up and walked towards the study.”

“Old Lady Lin was lying on the ground, unable to move her hands and feet. Even turning her head had become a luxury. She could only look at the ceiling. She tried to open her mouth to call for help, but she could not even utter a single syllable.”
