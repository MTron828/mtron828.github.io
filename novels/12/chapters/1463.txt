“Chapter 1464: 311: Ye Zao’s move, ABA’s youngest executive officer! 6”

Translator: 549690339

Aaron raised his right hand. “It doesn’t matter who I am. What’s important is that I know the person I’m looking for is you.”

Boom!

Carl only felt his vision go black before he fell to the ground.

Aaron looked at the two assistants. “Bring him back.”

“Yes.”

“Aaron pressed the hat on his head. His facial features also changed, immediately turning into the appearance of the deputy executive officer. ”

“When the office door opened again, the ‘Deputy Executive Officer’swaggered out of the office with two assistants. ”

The past staff greeted Yala respectfully.

Yala nodded.

“It was very easy, almost effortless, to leave the SELEAD branch. ”

“After walking out of Selead’s door, Yala turned around and looked inside, his face full of a mocking smile. “Selead is just so-so.” ”

“When Carl woke up again, it was a completely unfamiliar environment. ”

“A man in uniform walked over and said respectfully, “Mr. Carl, you’re awake. Do you need any help?” ”

“Carl suddenly didn’t understand the situation. He pinched his temple and asked, “Where is this?” ”

“The man continued, “This is RANIDOU’s headquarters. Minister Yaler personally invited you here.” ”

Carl then remembered the scene before he fainted.

Ranidu’s headquarters.

Minister Yalel.

“Could it be that the man just now was ranidu’s behind-the-scenes boss, Yalel? ”

Carl narrowed his eyes.

He thought that he should know something.

“At this moment, footsteps sounded in the quiet space. ”

“Carl turned around and saw Hibbert, who had lost to ye Zao that day. ”

“If ye Zao had not suddenly appeared and won against Hibbert, Hibbert would have been the new gambling king of ranito. ”

Unfortunately.

There were no ifs in this world.

“”Mr. Carl, our minister invites you!”Hibbert made a ‘please’gesture. ”

Carl narrowed his eyes and did not say anything. He walked forward.

“After walking for about ten minutes, they finally arrived at a room. ”

This was a billiard room.

Aaron was holding a billiard stick and bending over to play billiard.

PA!

He scored all in one shot.

“This was also the case. Aaron looked up at Carl. “Mr. Carl, do you want to play a round?” ”

An assistant immediately handed Carl a billiard stick.

“Carl raised his hand to reject. “Sorry, I don’t know how to play this.” ”

“Aaron said regretfully, “That’s such a pity. I originally wanted to play a round with Mr. Carl.” ”

“Carl smiled and said, “Secretary Arles, I’m not going to beat around the bush. Just tell me what you want to talk to me about!” ”

“Mr. Carl is really a straightforward person. I like to greet straightforward people.”Arles put the pool cue aside and looked up at Carl. He went straight to the point. “I want to see An.”

See Ye Zao?

Carl’s expression did not change.

Why did alar want to see ye Zao?

It must be revenge!

“After all, Ye Zao had caused such a huge loss to ranidou. ”

Ye Zao had only won one round against Hibbert at the gambling table.

It was just this one round that had broken Alar’s overall plan!

It had made Alar’s nearly 10 years of hard work go down the drain just like that.

So.

He absolutely could not let Yala see ye Zao. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“”An? Who is An? I’m not familiar with her!”Carl continued, “Minister Yala, you may have found the wrong person.” ”

Yala clapped his hands.

An assistant immediately turned on the projector. The big screen behind Yala immediately played the surveillance video.

Carl narrowed his eyes.

Didn’t he delete this surveillance video?

How did they recover it?

Yaler lit a cigar. “Mr. Carl still says he doesn’t know An?”

“Carl stood up and looked at the surveillance video carefully, he said incredulously, “You mean she’s An? Sorry! “I really don’t know. That day at Ranito’s door, it was the first time I saw her. I really don’t know her well! “We don’t even have a way to contact each other. If you don’t believe me, you can check my phone!” ”

“As he spoke, Carl took out his phone. ”

“”Mr. Carl, you have to know,”Yaler’s voice suddenly became fierce, “Since I can bring you here from the ABA branch quietly, I can make you disappear from this world quietly.” ”

“”I really don’t know An!”Carl was helpless. “Even if you really want me to disappear from this world, there’s nothing I Can Do!” ”

“”Don’t worry, I’m not looking for trouble with An. I’m looking for her to talk about cooperation.” ”

“But I really don’t know her!”Carl said.
