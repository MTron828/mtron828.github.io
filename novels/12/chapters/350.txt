“Chapter 351: 109: Great Burning’s first kiss with Master Five, Old Madam Song’s death! 4”

Translator: 549690339

“After dinner, Cen Shaoqing sent ye burning back. ”

“As soon as the car stopped, Cen Shaoqing saw ye Sen standing there. ”

“If he wasn’t mistaken, Ye Sen was still holding a steel pipe in his hand. ”

“Seeing ye burning get out of the car, Ye Sen quickly ran over. ”

“”Uncle, why are you here?” ”

“Ye Sen held the steel pipe in his hand. “Zao Zao, I recently learned two new boxing techniques. Let Me Show You!” ”

Boxing techniques?

Ye Zao looked at Ye Sen in bafflement.

“Ye Sen looked at Cen Shaoqing faintly and then said, “I’m not targeting anyone. I’m just trying to liven up the atmosphere.” ”

“After saying that, Ye Sen started to perform military boxing. ”

“After performing a set of military boxing, he even bent the steel pipe with a snap. ”

“What Ye Sen meant was, if anyone dared to bully his niece,. ”

He would make that person become the steel pipe in his hands!

“Cen Shaoqing:”...”he suspected that ye Sen was referring to him, but he had no evidence. ”

“Ye Sen raised his chin at Cen Shaoqing. “Mr. Cen, what do you think of my boxing style?” ”

“It’s very good!”Cen Shaoqing complimented.

“Ye Sen continued, “It’s already very late. I Won’t leave Mr. Cen at home to drink tea. Take care, Mr. Cen.” ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Ye Sen took ye Zao’s wrist. “Eldest niece, we’re going back.” ”

Ye Zao turned around and waved at Cen Shaoqing.

Cen Shaoqing did not drive away until the two figures disappeared into the corridor.

Ye Zao and Ye Sen returned home.

Ye Sen leaned the steel pipe against the wall.

“Ye Zao looked at the bent steel pipe and asked, “Uncle, when did you become so powerful?” ”

“”I’ve trained your uncle, okay?”Ye Sen rolled up his sleeves and showed ye Zao his biceps. ”

Ye Sen’s biceps were very well developed. It was obvious that he was not someone to be trifled with.

“After saying that, ye sen continued, “I believe that after tonight, that Cen won’t dare to have any improper thoughts towards you! Otherwise, I’ll make him become that steel pipe.” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “You’ve really misunderstood Cen Shaoqing.” ”

“Ye Sen opened a can of Coke. “Whether there’s a misunderstanding or not, it’s always right to take precautions.” ”

...

“Soon, it was the next day. ”

“In the morning, Ye Zhuo drove ye Sen to the airport. ”

She had just gotten her driver’s license. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Ye Sen sat in the front passenger seat and said nervously, “Big niece, can you do it? Why don’t I take a ride there?” ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Don’t worry, my skills are very good.” ”

“Really?”Ye Sen asked suspiciously.

“He had only gotten his driver’s license for less than three days, how good could his skills be? ”

“Moreover, the female driver also had the title of a road killer. ”

Ye Sen was really a little worried.

“”Of course it’s true.”Ye Zao skillfully started the engine and tilted his head to remind ye sen, “Uncle, Fasten Your Seatbelt.” ”

Ye Sen lowered his head and fastened his seatbelt.

“Ye Zao continued, “Uncle, there is serious racial discrimination in country P. during this period, many people are holding demonstrations. If you can not go out at night, try not to go out! Also...” ”

Ye Sen nodded.

He suddenly had the illusion that ye Zao was the Elder.

How could an elder go out and the younger generation be busy explaining this and that?

“However, there was no sense of dissonance. ”

“After explaining everything, ye Zao stepped on the accelerator. “Uncle, sit tight! We are about to set off!” ”

“Ye Sen gulped and suddenly felt a little nervous. “Zao Zao, why don’t I Drive? When you come back, you can find a designated driver.” ”

“As soon as he said this, the car rushed out. ”

It was extremely fast!

It was like an arrow that had left the bow.

Even an experienced driver like ye Sen usually did not dare to be so fierce.

Ye Zao was indeed a newborn calf that was not afraid of Tigers.

“Ye Sen said, “Zhuozhuo, slow down. This speed is too fast.” ”

“Isn’t this slow enough?”Ye Zao looked back at Ye Sen with a puzzled look in his eyes.

“”Isn’t this fast enough?”Ye Sen looked at the speedometer, his face pale with fear. “It’s, it’s already 120 yards!” ”

Ye Zao’s tone was indifferent. “It’s only 120 yards.”

“Only?”Ye Sen was stunned. “You don’t want to live anymore!”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Don’t worry about me driving.”As Ye Zao spoke, he sped up. ”

“Zao Zao! There’s a car in front! Slow down! Slow down!”

“Don’t Worry!”Ye Zao calmly controlled the steering wheel.

“With a beautiful tail flick, he steadily passed the car in front. ”

The driver in front thought that his eyes were playing tricks on him. He immediately rolled down the window and looked ahead. “Holy shit! Awesome!”

The other drivers on the road stared at the car in front with their mouths Agape.
