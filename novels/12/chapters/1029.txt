“She had never felt that ye Dahai and his wife were not her biological parents, so she had never expected anything from them. ”

“For a moment, Ye Shu was stunned as well. She stood there, not knowing how to react. ”

“Aunt Lang looked at Ye Shu. The tears that had already stopped suddenly surged again, and memory fragments appeared in front of her eyes one after another. ”

Every scene was half a month’s smiling face.

Every scene could overlap with ye Shu’s face.

She was too muddle-headed!

Too muddle-headed!

“The child looked so much like her, but she did not realize it at all. ”

“When she first met Ye Shu, she should have thought that ye Shu was half a month old. ”

“Aunt Lang wanted to hug ye Shu, but her feet seemed to be filled with lead, and she could not take even half a step forward. ”

“After a while, Aunty Lang finally reacted. She walked over to Ye Shu’s side and hugged her. She was so excited that she started babbling incoherently. “Ah Shu, Xiao Banyue, child, I’m sorry...” ”

“Aunty Lang had a thousand words to say, but at this moment, other than apologizing, she could not say anything else. ”

Her heart was filled with both happiness and pain.

She had mixed feelings.

Perhaps only someone who had experienced this kind of emotion could truly empathize with it.

“If she had seen Xi Muwen’s true face earlier, she would have been able to reunite her mother and daughter earlier. She would not have wasted so much time... ”

“Being hugged by Auntie Lang like this, Ye Shu’s eyes were slightly red. As a bystander, after hearing Auntie Lang’s story, she knew that it had not been easy for Auntie Lang all these years. “Don’t Cry...” ”

“After a while, Auntie Lang managed to control her emotions and followed ye Shu into the house. ”

Lin Jincheng called Elder Zhang and Cao Wei into the house.

“”Ah Shu, I should have found you a long time ago. It’s all my fault. I shouldn’t have listened to XI Muwen’s words. He’s simply unscrupulous! “He could even do this to his own daughter!”Auntie Lang sobbed. “Thank God, thank God you’re okay...”. “...”. “...” ”

“Ye Shu frowned slightly and continued, “You said that I lost it when I was three years old, but I have no impression of you at all! For the sake of caution, Aunt Lang, why don’t we do another paternity test?” ”

Ye Shu was very nervous now.

“If it was a blunder, wouldn’t it be awkward? ”

“A three-year-old child already had his own memories, but ye Shu did not remember anything about Aunt Lang. ”

“”That’s right! You’re My Little Half Moon! This time, I won’t admit my mistake again!”Aunt Lang held ye Shu’s hand tightly, unwilling to let go. ”

“Ye Shu still felt that this matter was a little precarious. Just as she was about to say something, a clear and shallow voice sounded in the air. ”

“”The reason why you don’t have any memories from before you were three years old is because XI Muwen specially left you outside to freeze for a night before he brought you to Yun Jing. That night caused you to have a high fever, and XI Muwen purposely did not give you any fever medicine. His original intention was probably to burn your brain. Unexpectedly, after your fever subsided, other than losing your memory, that high fever did not cause any other side effects.” ”

Xi Muwen was very smart.

He knew that half a month would definitely look for ye Langhua after she woke up.

“The three-year-old child was eloquent, and half a month was smart. She knew ye Langhua’s name, knew her home address and phone number, and even knew to call the police. ”

“As long as there was a chance, she would very likely call the police to find it herself. ”

“Therefore, Xi Muwen would not rest until half a month turned into a fool. ” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“When she heard this, Ye Langhua raised her head to look at ye Zao with a face full of disbelief. “Zao Zao, what did you say?” ”

“Ye Zao continued, “If you don’t believe me, you can take my mother to the hospital to get a brain CT..” ”

Ye Langhua covered her mouth and almost cried out loud.

“”Crying won’t solve any problems,”ye Zao continued, “You should cheer up and let Xi Muwen’s family of three get what they deserve. In fact, you should have done this thirty-six years ago!” ”

“Ye Zhuo had always been a vengeful person. If she was ye Langhua, she wouldn’t have waited until now. ”

“Elder Zhang’s eyes lit up. “I think Miss Ye is right! Langhua! Xi muwen, that scum, made the two of you suffer for so many years. You should let them get what they deserve!” ”

“Ye Langhua had been curled up in her turtle shell for thirty-six years. At this moment, she no longer had the arrogant look she had back then. Looking at Ye Zhuo now, she seemed to see herself back then. ”

Ye Langhua’s gaze became firmer bit by bit. She nodded slowly. “Alright!”
