Lin Ze’s handwriting had been practiced.

“It was well-balanced, and the strokes were horizontal. ”

It was very good-looking.

The reporter took the notebook with both hands and couldn’t help but take another look at Lin Ze.

Lin Ze was indeed worthy of being the top scholar in the liberal arts.

Just this stroke.

“Even someone like her, who was from the Chinese department, couldn’t compare to it. ”

“”Thank you, Lin Ze. My son usually studies very hard too. If he knew that this sentence was written for him by this year’s top scholar in the liberal arts, he would definitely be very happy!” ”

“You’re welcome. I wish your son the best in the college entrance examination next year.”

The reporter continued to thank him.

“After the interview, the reporter left the Lin family home. ”

Old Mrs. Lin took out her phone and wanted to inform every relative in the family about Lin Ze being the top scholar in the liberal arts.

“”Grandma, I’m going upstairs to rest.” ”

“Old Mrs. Lin said lovingly, “Go on, go on. When we eat later, I’ll ask Xiao Zhao to bring the food to your room.” ”

Lin Ze nodded.

“Feng Qianhua said, “Aunt Lin, I Won’t Disturb You Then. I’ll take Xianxian back first.” ”

“Old Mrs. Lin continued, “Wait a minute, Xianxian. Grandma promised you that as long as you do well in the exam, she will give you a surprise. What do you want? Grandma will get someone to buy it for you.” ”

“Feng Xianxian tried her best to smile. “Thank you, Grandma. There’s no need. I was just joking with you just now.”Feng Xianxian originally wanted to show off her high score in front of Lin Ze, who knew that Lin Ze would get the top scorer in the liberal arts? ”

What was the difference between this and humiliating himself?

Feng Xianxian did not have the face to ask for anything now!

“”How can it be considered a joke! Since Grandma promised you, she will definitely do it!”Old Mrs. Lin said seriously, “Tell me, what do you want?” ”

“Feng Qianhua smiled and said, “Aunt Lin, you don’t have to be so polite. This child doesn’t lack anything. She just wants to make you happy!” ”

“Old Madam Lin said, “Ah Ze got the top scorer in the liberal arts and Xianxian also got the third place in the city. If she’s happy today, I’ll buy whatever Xianxian wants for her.” ”

Feng Qianhua’s expression turned ugly for a moment. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

So.

Feng Xianxian was only basking in Lin Ze’s glory?

What was this!

No Way!

She had to think of a way to give birth to a child for Lin Jincheng.

The child she gave birth to.

Would definitely be a thousand times better than that B * Tch ye Shu!

Ten Thousand Times!

“”Aunt Lin, there’s really no need!”Feng Qianhua said with a smile, “Ah Ze was the top scholar in the liberal arts. He should be the one you should reward the most!” ”

These words finally hit the bottom of old Mrs. Lin’s heart.

“”Yes, yes, yes! I was just thinking about what surprise I should prepare for Ah Ze! This child doesn’t lack anything, and I don’t know what he wants...”at the end of her sentence, Old Mrs. Lin’s voice was filled with worry. ”

“Hearing this, Feng Qianhua’s expression changed again. She knew that this old hag had no intention of preparing a gift for Feng Xianxian. ”

For a moment.

Feng Qianhua even questioned her many years of persistence.

Was her persistence really meaningful?

She was so good to Old Mrs. Lin.

“In the end, what did she get? ”

This old hag kept saying that she treated her as her daughter-in-law.

But did she really keep her words to herself?

“In Old Lady Lin’s heart, there was only Lin Ze, her biological grandson. ”

Those who were close to each other were always close to each other.

“Thinking of this, Feng Qianhua’s eyes flashed with a hint of sarcasm. “Aunt Lin, we’ll go back first.” ”

“Old Lady Lin smiled and said, “I’ll get the driver to send you back.” ”

“”No need to trouble you, Aunt Lin. I drove here.” ”

“Old Mrs. Lin instructed, “Then drive slowly.” ”

“I know.”

Old Mrs. Lin sent Feng Qianhua to the door.

Feng Qianhua and Feng Xianxian got into the car.

It was very quiet in the car.

Feng Qianhua had lost so much face today that Feng Xianxian did not even dare to make a sound.

She was afraid of adding fuel to the fire.

“All the way back to the Feng family, Feng Qianhua did not say a word. ”

“If she didn’t die in silence, she would explode in silence. ”

Feng Xianxian was very scared.

“When she got home, Feng Xianxian took the initiative to pour Feng Qianhua a glass of water. “Mom, have some water.” ”

“PA –”

Feng Qianhua directly waved away the glass that Feng Xianxian handed over.

The boiling hot tea was poured all over Feng Xianxian’s hands.

Her fair skin was burning red.

“”Mom, I’m sorry! I was wrong!”Feng Xianxian was so scared that she directly knelt on the ground. ”

“Feng Qianhua didn’t say anything, but her eyes were full of anger. ”

Feng Xianxian was her proudest daughter.

“Since she was three years old, she had sent Feng Xianxian to all kinds of training classes, so that she could cultivate Feng Xianxian into a talented girl that everyone knew. ”
