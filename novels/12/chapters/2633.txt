Turn off the phone?

Why would boss Wang turn off the phone at this time?

What was going on?

“Li Hang tried his best to calm himself down. He turned his head to look at the man beside him and continued, “Wait a moment, this must be a misunderstanding. I am contacting my Uncle Now.””

Boss Wang did not need to rent a house to deceive them.

“The only explanation was that the house belonged to boss Wang. The people under him did not know and thought that they were tenants, so they could collect the rent.”

“After all, boss Wang was the boss of a real estate company.”

“”Okay, contact him first.””

“Li hang opened wechat again and dialed a voice call. However, the screen showed ‘you are not a friend in the other party’s contact list’.”

He was blacklisted.

Li Hang was stunned. She did not expect boss Wang to blacklist Zhou Cuihua.

Everything happened too suddenly.

“Li Hang looked at Zhou cuihua and asked, “Mom, have you and uncle Wang quarreled recently? Or did you make Uncle Wang Unhappy?””

“”No!”Zhou cuihua continued, “We have been chatting very well these few days.””

Li Hang opened other social media apps and found that boss Wang had blocked all of Zhou Cuihua’s accounts. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Immediately, Li Hang took out his phone again, and the result was the same.”

“The staff at the side was a little anxious and continued to speak, “Ladies, if you don’t intend to renew the lease, please move out before noon today at 12 o’clock. If you want to renew the lease, please renew the rent for a month first.””

Li Hang did not know how to react.

“Although she did not want to admit that boss Wang had lied to Zhou Cuihua and them, that was the truth.”

“If it was a misunderstanding, boss Wang would not have blocked them at all.”

What should they do now?

Li Hang tried not to lose his composure in front of others and tried his best to maintain his smile. “May I ask if the person who checked in was called Wang Zhengxuan?”

The staff member flipped through the information in his hands and nodded. “It was him.”

It was really rented.

“Li hang continued, “Alright, I got it. Thank you. We will move out before 12 o’clock.””

“”Alright.”The staff member nodded. “Ladies, I will be leaving first. If there is anything you need, you can contact me at any time.””

“Alright.”

The staff member turned around and left.

“Looking at the staff member’s back view, Li Hang’s expression was slowly breaking down.”

“Zhou Cuihua’s face was pale. She looked at Li hang and said, “What about hang? Your Uncle Wang Won’t lie to me! Why would he lie to me!””

There was no need for a person to spend so much money to lie to her.

“He won’t lie to me!”

Li Hang’s expression was also very ugly. “When was the last time you contacted him?”

“Zhou cuihua said, “When I just woke up in the morning, we even contacted each other. Oh right, he also said...””

Zhou cuihua could not continue what she was about to say.

“Li hang immediately asked, “What else did he say?””

Zhou cuihua gulped. “He said that he would give me a mysterious gift today.”

Zhou Cuihua was still looking forward to this gift in the morning.

Could it be...

“The more Zhou Cuihua thought about it, the paler her face became.”

“”Hang Hang, what should we do now?””

Zhou Cuihua was very flustered.

What if boss Wang was really a swindler?

“In order to find a rich businessman and live the life of a rich wife like Xia Xiaoman, Zhou Cuihua now had nothing.”

She even gave the last sum of money to the detective agency.

How was she going to live in the future?

Especially since she moved Li Hang’s account from Li Dalong’s side. What was Li hang going to do in the future?

“”How would I know what to do!”Li Hang was furious. “When you divorced my father and insisted on moving my account out, why didn’t you think of this!””

Li Hang was very angry now!

It was all Zhou Cuihua’s fault!

It was simply not enough to accomplish anything.

“If it were not for Zhou cuihua, she would not have come to this point.”

“”How did I know that things would turn out like this!”Zhou cuihua almost burst into tears. She continued, “Hang Hang, don’t be anxious. Maybe your uncle Wang is just joking with us!””

“Hearing this, Li Hang’s expression changed.”

Rich people like to play probing games...

Maybe boss Wang was standing in front of the camera looking at them at this moment.

Right.

It must be like this.

“Li hang sorted out his emotions and continued, “Mom, I Don’t Blame You. I just feel that your decision back then was too arbitrary!””
