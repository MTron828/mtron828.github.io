“[ is there something wrong with the person above? If Miss Ye really loves vanity, then there’s no need for the Zen throne! ] ”

“[ but this is indeed a suspicious point! She’s obviously not the daughter of another person, yet she still wants to pretend! I feel that ye Zao is quite scheming! ] ”

“After a moment, ye Zao continued speaking, “I think everyone must be very curious. Why did I pretend to be the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Manman before this? “Because the real full moon princess is my best friend. We met when we were wandering. She had been waiting for her family to bring her back. Unfortunately, this wish was buried with her in that snowy day ”

“”At that time, we were twelve years old. Every day, she hoped that her parents could find her. “Until the day before her death, she still asked me to help her find her biological parents. All these years, I have never given up on finding her family... “Until recently, I finally found the long-forgotten truth. Now, let’s go back to nineteen years ago.” ”

“With that, Ye Zhuo pressed the button on his wristwatch. ”

“Soon, a transparent video appeared in the air. ”

“Hearing this, Zhao Dan already had an ominous premonition in her heart. She wanted to say something to stop ye Zhuo, but she couldn’t find any way. ”

What should she do!

“In an instant, Zhao Dan’s face was covered in layers of cold sweat. ”

“At this moment, images gradually appeared on the air screen. ”

“These people were man Jiangshan, Zhao Dan, and the woman holding the child. ”

The location was man family. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Man Jiangshan said, “Li Man! Send her away immediately, as far away as possible!” ”

“The woman holding the child was a little hesitant. She raised her head and looked at man Jiangshan. “But, but she is your and Madam’s biological daughter.” ”

“Moreover, the child was still so young. If she really wanted to throw it away, she would not be able to do it. ”

“However, man Jiangshan’s attitude was extremely cold. ”

“Zhao dan cried and said, “She is only two years old! If something happens to the full moon, what will we say to the public?” ”

“Just say that she is missing!”Man Jiangshan said.

It was just a child that was lost. No one would suspect anything.

“Zhao dan continued, “But she is our child!” ”

“Man Jiangshan looked at Zhao Dan and said angrily, “A woman’s benevolence! From now on, this vile spawn has nothing to do with our man family! Unless you want us all to be killed by her!” ”

Zhao Dan did not speak anymore. He only cried silently. His eyes were extremely red and swollen.

“Li Man raised her head to look at man Jiangshan and asked carefully, “Sir, then, then where are you sending the Little Princess?” ”

“”Shut up! Li Man, give me the pig! From now on, there is no full moon princess in man Xing Kingdom! The One in your arms is a dog! I have already done my best to spare her life!” ”

“If it were anyone else, they would have crushed this little disaster to death. ”

“The child in Li Man’s arms did not know that she was about to be abandoned, nor did she know what she was dreaming about. She laughed out sweetly. ”

“As soon as she finished speaking, man Jiangshan continued, “Send him to the eternal glacier in the state of Changyue.” ”

What kind of place was the Eternal Glacier?

It was comparable to Hell on Earth!

Sending the child to such a place was a dead end.

“However, man Jiangshan and Zhao Dan had given a death order. Li Man was only a nanny, so she could only listen to them. Thus, she sent the child to the eternal glacier overnight. ”

“Through the surveillance camera, Zhao Dan saw the full moon abandoned in the ice and snow, isolated and helpless. ”

“As a mother, how could she accept such a scene? ”

She cried until she fainted.

“She thought that after one night, the child, who was less than two years old, would definitely die. Who knew that the next day, Zhao Dan turned on the surveillance camera again, but the child did not die! ”

“However, although she did not die, half of her life was gone. ”

“She stumbled from the Eternal Glacier to the downtown area. From a princess who lived in luxury, she became a street urchin. She ate her fill, used the sky as her blanket, and used the earth as her bed. ”

“After all, she was her own daughter. Zhao Dan looked at her daughter who was living on the street through the monitor, crying all day long. ”

“Until one day, Zhao Dan was diagnosed to be pregnant again. ”

“The doctor warned, “Madam, this fetus is unstable. You must pay attention to rest and maintain a happy mood. Otherwise, it will increase the risk of miscarriage!” ”

“She had just lost a daughter, and now there was a child. ”

“Zhao Dan felt that this was a gift from God. No matter what, she must give birth to this child properly and not let her suffer anymore. ”

“At night, Zhao Dan turned on the monitor again. ”

At that time.

The state of Changyue was experiencing a once-in-a-century snowstorm.
