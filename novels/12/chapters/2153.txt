It was a competition to see who gave the most extravagant gifts.

Guangxing also found ye Han at the first moment. “Mr. Xiao Ye! Mr. Xiao Ye!”

Ye Han looked up from a pile of documents. “What’s Wrong?”

“”Is my grandmother really back?”Until now, Guangxing had always thought that ye Zhuo was his grandmother. ”

“Yes.”Ye Han nodded.

“”That’s great! Thank you, Mr. Little Ye!”Guangxing bowed to Ye Han and then left. ”

“After ye Han left, the evil doctor rushed in again. “Chief Little Ye! Chief Little Ye!” ”

“Without waiting for the evil doctor to speak, ye Han directly said, “Yes, my sister is back. She is the girlfriend of the young master of Dongli!” ”

The evil doctor was just about to open his mouth.

“Ye Han beat him to it and said, “You’re welcome!” ”

The evil doctor simply did not say anything and turned around to run out.

“Following that, a lot of people came. ”

“Ye Han recorded a holographic video and placed it at the door. As long as he entered the password, he could watch it while he himself closed the door to handle official business. ”

Manxing country.

“Zhao Dan put on a coat for Manxing who was practicing his calligraphy. “Xing ‘er, do you want to go with your father to the Alliance’s family recognition banquet?” ”

“”Yes,”said man Xing. ”

“This was a rare occasion, so of course she wanted to go. ”

“Zhao dan continued, “By the way, Xing ‘er, have you heard?” ”

“What?”Asked man Xing.

“”It’s about the rumors about that Earthling,”said Zhao Dan. “Some people said that she did it according to ye Zao’s appearance, and some people said that Leo was so angry that he flew directly to Changyue!” ”

“Is that so?”Man Xing asked.

“”Yes.”Zhao dan nodded and continued, “I heard from Merrill Lynch that the husband of a friend of Merrill Lynch’s is Leo’s adjutant. I heard that lightning struck and caused a great fire. The entire mahogany table was smashed into pieces!” ”

“Man Xing did not speak, and his hand that was practicing calligraphy did not stop. ”

“Then how did ye Han React?”Man Xing asked in a flash.

Zhao Dan shook his head. “I’m not too sure about that.”

It was still quite difficult to plant spies in changyue.

“After saying that, Zhao Dan continued to add, “Although ye Han’s position was snatched from ye Zao’s hands, in order to put on an act, he definitely had to show that he was very angry!” ”

“Man Xing did not directly answer Zhao Dan’s question. Instead, he said, “Mom, what do you think of my handwriting?” ”

Zhao Dan lowered his head and saw a beautiful big word written on the snow-white paper.

High.

“”High?”Zhao Dan frowned slightly. “Xing ‘er, what does this word mean?” ”

“MAN XING smiled and said, “Isn’t Duanmu Feng’s move of killing without spilling blood high?” ”

“Killing without spilling blood?”Zhao Dan asked.

“Man Xing nodded and asked in return, “Mom, who do you think spread the rumors about ye Zhuo’s plastic surgery and the fake?” ”

“Zhao Dan shook his head at first, then quickly reacted. “Could it be Duanmu Feng and Ye Zhuo?” ”

“”Yes,”man Xing continued, “Duanmu Feng and Ye Zhuo want to use ye Zhuo to stir up the anger of everyone. Elder sister holds a very important position in their hearts. When they learn that young master Dongli’s girlfriend is actually a replica of elder sister, when the General Alliance announces the relationship between Ye Zhuo and Young Master Dongli, Leo, Ye Han, and the others will unconsciously stand on Duanmu Feng’s side. At that time, Duanmu Feng and Ye Han can rightfully sit back and reap the benefits of the others.” ”

“From the moment Zhao Dan mentioned this matter, Manxing had already analyzed the reason behind it. ”

“If not, the alliance would definitely not have made such a statement for no reason ”

Zhao Dan narrowed his eyes. “I didn’t expect Duanmu Feng to be so scheming!”

The corners of Manxing’s mouth curled up slightly. “The Duanmu family is different from the past. They were born in troubled waters and want to occupy a high position. How can they not be scheming?”

“As long as it was related to power, there was no such thing as innocence. ”

Man Xing would not look down on anyone just because of their appearance.

“Zhao dan continued, “Then is Duanmu Feng going to win this time?” ”

“”That depends on how much young master Dongli likes Ye Zhuo.”Man Xing turned to look at Zhao Dan. “Mom, how much do you think I look like elder sister?” ”

“Hearing this, Zhao Dan raised his head to look at man Xing. ”

“MAN XING had inherited the good genes of his family, so he was very beautiful. However, he did not have much in common with Ye Zhuo. ”

“If one had to say that they were alike, there were times when man Xing’s demeanor and manner of speaking were indeed very similar to ye Zhuo. ”

“”About twenty to thirty percent,”Zhao Dan continued, “My daughter is so beautiful that she is like nature itself. She is unique and not a copy of anyone else.” ”

“It was undeniable that ye Zhuo was indeed very beautiful, but the stars were not bad either. ”Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com
