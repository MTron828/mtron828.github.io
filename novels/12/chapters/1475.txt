“Chapter 1476: 314: terrifying, torturing him non-stop! 1”

Translator: 549690339

Ye Zao being able to go alone to ranidou and bring Carl out unharmed was enough to prove her ability!

“If Smith still had doubts about ye Zao in the morning, then now, Smith did not have any doubts at all!”

She believed in ye Zao.

“Although the little girl in front of her was young and slim, the power contained in her body was infinite.”

“Thinking of this, Smith continued, “Please Promise me, Miss Ye.””

“”Miss Smith, go ahead.”Ye Zhuo turned to look at Smith.”

“Smith continued, “Because of the surveillance, L hacked all the computers in our SELEAD branch. I hope...””

“Smith found it difficult to say the rest. After all, she did not trust ye Zhuo and thought that Polly had restored the surveillance.”

Smith was very regretful now. He regretted that he did not trust ye Zao back then.

“”So, Miss Smith, you hope that our Miss Ye can help you fight against L. Restore the system, right?”Bai Xiaosu said from the side.”

“Yes.”Smith nodded.

“Bai xiaosu smiled and said, “But isn’t the person who restored the surveillance to Mr. Polly? “Miss Ye doesn’t even have the ability to restore the surveillance. How can she help you fight against L. ? “Miss Smith, you should say this to Mr. Polly. I believe that Mr. Polly will definitely be able to successfully defeat L.””

Ye Zhuo was indifferent to fame and fortune. He could let this matter go.

But Bai Xiaosu could not swallow his anger.

“Ye Zhuo was clearly the one who restored the surveillance, but Smith allowed Adar to forcefully pin the credit on Polly.”

“If L didn’t come looking for him, then wouldn’t the credit belong to Polly?”

This was too unfair to ye Zao.

“Smith looked guilty. “Leader Bai, this is all a misunderstanding. The person who restored the surveillance has always been Miss Ye. It has nothing to do with Polly!””

“Is that so?”Bai Xiaosu put on a fake smile.

“Yes.”Smith nodded.

“Bai Xiaosu continued, “Miss Smith, don’t you think that what you said is too simple? If it wasn’t for the fact that Polly couldn’t handle L. , wouldn’t the misunderstanding continue?””

“Smith was stunned for a moment, then he turned to yadar, “Yadar, hurry up and bring Polly over to apologize to Miss Ye.””

Yadar was very unwilling.

“The surveillance footage was clearly restored by Polly, yet ye Zao shamelessly said that she was the one who restored it and even made him apologize!”

On what basis?

Yardar did not want to apologize.

“Polly walked over to Yardar’s side. “Mr. Yardar, let’s go and apologize to her.””

Yardar snorted coldly. “What right does she have to make me apologize to her?”

“Polly lowered his voice and said, “Mr. Yardar, do you think she can contend with L. ?”” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Just her? She doesn’t even have the right to serve L. Tea and water!”

“It was not that Yardar looked down on ye Zao, but ye Zao really did not have the ability to do so.”

“When Country F had computers, the Chinese still had small braids!”

Ye Zao wanted to defeat L. ?

Dream On!

“Polly smiled and said, “So, let’s go apologize first. There’s a saying that the higher you stand, the worse the fall.””

“Hearing that, Adar narrowed his eyes.”

He felt that Polly was right.

“If they apologized to ye Zao now, Ye Zao would not be able to defeat L. Let’s see how ye Zao would raise his head in front of everyone!”

“”Mr. Adar, let’s go.””

Adar nodded and followed Polly’s footsteps. The two of them walked to ye Zao’s side.

“”Miss Ye, it was all my fault before. You were the one who restored the surveillance cameras. I shouldn’t have taken away the credit that belongs to you. There’s a saying in China that the Prime Minister can hold a boat in his stomach. I hope that you won’t lower yourself to the level of a small fry like me.” Polly bowed deeply to ye Zao.”

“Adar also apologized, “Miss Ye, I’m also at fault in this matter. I hope you won’t hold a grudge against me!””

“Although Polly and Adar were apologizing, ye Zao could see from their eyes that they were looking at a joke.”

“Ye Zao was originally too lazy to intervene in this matter. After all, her purpose in coming to C Nation was to save Carl. Now that Carl was fine, it was time for her to go back.”

Now.

“Since someone was looking for trouble, wouldn’t she be a disappointment if she didn’t make a move?”

“Ye Zao smiled faintly. “As a man, you don’t care about the faults of a villain.””

The smile on Adar’s face froze at the corner of his mouth.

He was just being polite when he said that a man didn’t care about the faults of a villain.

But the meaning behind ye Zao’s words was clearly that he treated him as a villain!
