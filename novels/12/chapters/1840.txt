“”Witch Doctor.”The chief suddenly thought of the witch doctor, “Perhaps, this matter is related to the Witch Doctor.” ”

“In the Chang Yue country, the only person who could be compared to ye Zao in terms of medical skills was the Great Witch Doctor. ” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“But the Great Witch Doctor disappeared three years ago.”The three chiefs said.

“Three years ago, after the Great Witch Doctor was defeated by Ye Zao, he disappeared without a trace. After that, he never appeared in public again. ”

“In recent years, there were even rumors that the great witch doctor had died. ”

“The great patriarch continued, “All the rumors were spread by the Great Witch Doctor himself. It’s easy for him to disappear. Similarly, it’s easy for him to return. Ever since he lost to Miss Ye, the Great Witch Doctor has been unwilling. That’s why he teamed up with Qiu Di to create an accident.” ”

“The strong stood at the very top, so naturally, there were people who were envious and coveting. ”

The Great Witch Doctor and autumn flute were among them.

The three clan leaders nodded. “What the great clan leader said makes sense.”

On the other side.

Autumn Flute’s office.

“After learning that autumn flute had successfully obtained the star-crossing case, autumn flute was very excited and immediately rushed over from her office. ”

“After checking it, autumn flute said, “Ye Zao has set the permissions on the information. Other than ye Zao, no one else can open it.” ”

“Hearing this, autumn flute frowned. ”

“If no one else could open it, then what was the difference between the information of the star-crossing case and a piece of white paper to her? ”

“”Father, is there no other way?” ”

“Autumn town hesitated for a moment, then nodded and said, “Yes.” ”

“What Way?”Autumn flute immediately asked.

“To find the person with the Phoenix Life!”Autumn Town said.

The person with the Phoenix’s life?

“Autumn flute curled the corners of her lips. “Father, do you think that other than me, who else could be a person with the Phoenix’s life?” ”

She was the high and Mighty Phoenix!

A Phoenix reborn from the flames!

Ye Zhuo was just a sparrow.

“Autumn town looked at autumn flute and continued, “Then drop a drop of blood on this.” ”

Autumn flute bit her fingertip and dropped a drop of blood on it.

The bright red blood was quickly absorbed by the data.

“Seeing this, Qiu Changzhen was very excited. ”

Because this was the sign of a Phoenix’s life.

Good!

This was really too good!

“He did not expect that after so many years, the Qiu family had finally produced a Golden Phoenix! ”

“But in the next second, Qiu Changzhen was stunned. ”

Because the blood that had already been absorbed appeared at this moment.

Qiu Changzhen’s pupils gradually dilated.

“Qiu Di also felt that something was wrong. He raised his head and asked, “Father, what’s going on?” ”

“”You, you, you might not be a phoenix life,”Qiu Changzhen said. ”

“Although he was very unwilling to say this, Qiu Changzhen had no choice but to open his mouth. Damn ”

“Hearing this, Qiu Di’s face was filled with disbelief. “No, it can’t be! How can I not be a Phoenix Life! I am a Phoenix Life! I am a Phoenix Life!” ”

“Seeing Qiu di like this, Qiu Changzhen immediately said, “Di’er, don’t be so agitated. It’s possible that I’ve made a mistake!” ”

“Then what do we do now?”Qiu Di asked.

“Qiu Changzhen continued, “Then there’s only one method left.” ”

“What method?”

“Qiu Changzhen said, “Go to the base.” ”

“”Go to the base?”Qiu Di also reacted at this time. “Father, you want to see Ye Zhuo’s body?” ”

Autumn town nodded. “Yes.”

“After all, only ye Zhuo could open the cross-star file. ”

“”Okay, then let’s go now.”Autumn flute stood up and said. ”

“Okay.”

The two turned around and walked out.

“The Fierce Wind roared outside, and the drizzling rain suddenly turned into heavy rain. ”

“Seeing ye Han standing in the rain with only an umbrella, autumn town frowned slightly and said, “Di-er, that’s Ye Han after all.” ”

“”Father,”Qiu di slowly turned his head and looked at Qiu Changzhen, correcting him, “He is Wu Han.” ”

“Qiu Changzhen said, “Aren’t you afraid that he will turn against you by treating Wu Han like this?” ”

“”He won’t.”Qiu di continued, “Father, don’t worry about these things that won’t happen.” ”

“”But acid rain is corrosive.”Qiu Changzhen continued, “At this rate, how many more years Can Wu Han Last?” ”

“Qiu di snorted coldly, “Why do you care about a dog?” ”

“Soon, it would be the day of the general election. ”

“As long as she sat on that throne as she wished, Ye Han would be of no use to her. ”

She wanted to slowly torture ye Han to death.

“Qiu changzhen frowned, “Di’er...” ”

“”Alright, you don’t have to say anymore.”Qiu di said impatiently, “I know what to do.” ”

“Hearing that, autumn town no longer said anything more. ”
