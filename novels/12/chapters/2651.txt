“Chapter 2652: 573: a new life, a new beginning”

“Although Sun Guixiang sympathized with Li Hang, if Li Hang made her do something that cost her money, then she wouldn’t do it!”

“In this day and age, which family didn’t want a life?”

“But Li Hang was not only a girl, but also a top student. He basically didn’t have to worry about finding a job. If he got married in the future, he wouldn’t have to worry about marrying a local.”

“If he treated Li hang as his biological daughter, she would be the one who would benefit in the future.”

“After all, Li Hang did not have a biological mother now, and his biological father did not want her anymore.”

“If Li Hang was a boy, then Sun Guixiang would not do such a loss-making business.”

“A boy not only had to get married and have children, but he also had to buy a marriage house.”

Who would be willing to do a loss-making business?

“When Li Hang heard Sun Guixiang’s words, he was very touched. He looked at Sun Guixiang and said, “Auntie, thank you.””

“Sun Guixiang held Li Hang’s hand and said, “You silly child, why are you being so polite with Auntie? From now on, we are one family. Don’t talk about two families as a family.””

“Okay.”Li hang nodded.

Zhou Xiatian looked at Sun Guixiang and felt very gratified.

“He had thought that his wife would object to this matter, but he did not expect Sun Guixiang to be so sensible. Damn”

“In fact, this was how a family should be.”

“Li hang continued, “Aunt, I plan to look for a job after I go back. If it’s possible, I’ll stay in the company dormitory.””

“Although Zhou Xiatian and Sun Guixiang said that she could stay in the Zhou family and treat her as their biological daughter, she was still an outsider.”

It was not suitable to stay at uncle and aunt’s house all the time.

“”What company dormitory! Besides, it’s not easy to find a job now!”At this point, Sun Guixiang looked at Zhou Xiaowen and continued, “Xiaowen, is your company still lacking people?””

“Yes.”Zhou Xiaowen nodded.

“Sun guixiang continued, “Then introduce your sister in.””

“Sun Guixiang was talking about her sister, not her cousin. This sentence made Li hang even more moved and regretted his previous actions.”

“If she had not done it, how would things have developed to this point.”

A good family had just been broken up like that.

“Things have changed, but people have changed.”

“Li hang sighed in his heart, his face full of loneliness.”

“Zhou Xiaowen looked at Li Hang. “Hang, do you want to try joining our company?””

“Li Hang had graduated from a famous school, so it was not difficult for him to join their company. As long as Li Hang was willing, Zhou Xiaowen would arrange for her to join.”

“Li hang nodded. “Brother, I’ll have to Trouble You Then.””

“The company that Zhou Xiaowen was locked in was also a foreign company. The benefits and treatment were very good. Moreover, Zhou Xiaowen was a leader in the company. With Zhou Xiaowen taking care of her, her situation in the company would be better.”

“”Okay, then I’ll go back and make some arrangements. Wait for me to inform you to go to work,”Zhou Xiaowen said.”

“Okay.”Li hang nodded.

“Sun guixiang continued, “Hang Hang, your brother’s company is close to home. After you go to work, don’t stay in the dormitory! “What’s so good about a dormitory? There are messy people living in a house, and some people are especially unhygienic. You’d better stay at home with us!””

“Since she had already decided to accept Li Hang, Sun Guixiang naturally wouldn’t let Li Hang live outside.”

“Once a person was far away, their feelings would become distant.”

“Hearing that.., zhou Xiaxia immediately nodded and echoed, “Your aunt is right. You are a girl, living alone outside is always worrying. If anything happens, your mother will not forgive me even in the Netherworld.””

“Sun Guixiang held Li Hang’s hand tightly and continued, “Hang Hang, in any case, I will not let you move out. If you leave, I will hold your hand tightly.””

Li hang was very touched. He felt more and more sorry for Zhou Xiatian and Sun Guixiang.

In the future.

“When she had the ability, she would definitely repay him well.” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“If it wasn’t for Zhou Xiatian and Sun Guixiang this time, she didn’t know how she would have survived this.”

At night.

Sun Guixiang sat in front of the dressing table in the bedroom and applied skincare products.

Zhou Xiatian washed up and walked out of the bathroom.

“”I’m done washing up,”Sun Guixiang asked.”

“”Okay.”Zhou Xiaxia nodded and looked up at Sun Guixiang. “Guixiang, thank you.””

“Sun guixiang smiled and said, “Thank me for what?””

“Zhou Xiaxia continued, “Thank you for accepting Hang Hang.””

“If Sun Guixiang did not accept Li Hang, then Li Hang would be a homeless orphan now.”

“Sun Guixiang said, “Your heart aches for this niece of yours, Hang Hang. As your aunt, my feelings are the same as yours.””

“At this point, Sun Guixiang sighed, then, she said, “No matter what, I still feel that Li Da Long is not a human. Hang Hang is his biological daughter, but he is like an outsider! “It’s fine if he doesn’t care about hang, but Cuihua is his wife after all. It’s said that a husband and wife have a hundred days of grace. Cuihua has already left, but he doesn’t even show his face!””
