“Mother Xu was standing downstairs. When she saw Xu Xiao coming down, she immediately went up to her and asked, “How was it? What did your Aunt Say?” ”

“”Nothing much,”Xu Xiao replied. ”

“Seeing that Xu Xiao’s face was even longer than a donkey’s face, mother Xu could guess the content of their conversation. ”

“Xu Chaonan was very pessimistic about the matter between Xu Xiao and he ziteng. Previously, he had also looked for the couple. Seeing that they were unable to persuade Xu Xiao, he had no choice but to personally make a move. ”

“”Xiao Xiao, ignore her. I think she just can’t stand seeing US mother and daughter Get Along!”Mother Xu continued, “To put it bluntly, she is jealous of you! Jealous that you are younger than her, jealous that you married better than her!” ”

“”Mom, I know. Don’t worry. I will never give up on he ziteng.”It was not easy for her to hook up with he ziteng, so how could she give up just because of a few words from Xu Chaonan. ”

“Seeing Xu Xiao like this, mother Xu heaved a sigh of relief. ”

...

“After Xu Chaonan left the Xu family home, he went to a restaurant. ”

She was having dinner with her best friend from school.

“Unlike Xu Chaonan, the child of her best friend, Zhou Ying, was already 16 years old this year and was about to enter university. ”

Xu Chaonan told Zhou Ying about Xu Xiao.

“Hearing this, Zhou ying frowned and continued, “Back then, if only you could have had a child of your own! This niece is still different from her own child.” ”

“Xu Chaonan picked up his glass and took a sip of wine. “Actually, Xiao Xiao is quite obedient. It’s just that it’s easy to fall for her sometimes.” ”

“Zhou Ying did not want to comment more on Xu Xiao and continued, “Aren’t you going to find someone? Actually, at your age, finding someone and having a child is completely within your means.” ”

Xu Chaonan shook his head.

She was very busy and did not have the time to think about such nonsense.

“Moreover, Xu Chaonan was a little afraid of marriage. ”

“What was so good about marriage? If she met someone like Xu Xiao’s father who did not know how to earn his own money, it would be fine. But if she had to earn money to support him, then it would be meaningless. It would be better to be alone. ”

“Zhou Ying said, “Actually, I sometimes envy you, but sometimes I don’t Envy You.” ”

“Xu Chaonan smiled and continued, “I should be the one who is envious of you. A husband and wife love each other and have two children. Zhou Ying, you are simply a winner in life.” ”

“Zhou Ying was a little speechless and said, “I think you are just here to mock me. I’m already an old woman, what’s there to envy?” ” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“I’m serious.”Xu Chaonan raised his cup again. “I really envy you.”

“Many times, Xu Chaonan thought that it would be great if she could have a child of her own. ”

What a pity.

Things did not go as planned.

On the other side.

At the Qiu family home.

“Qiu Di sat in the laboratory and looked at the information sent over by the eight great families. She frowned slightly and said, “Wang Yue, come over here for a moment.” ”

“The assistant took a step forward. “Miss, do you have any orders?” ”

Qiu di knocked on the table. “Do you need me to ask? What’s with this information? What I want to see is about the LS star transference case. What did you give me?”

“After saying this, Qiu di continued, “Immediately go and bring me the information on the star transference case!” ”

“Hearing this, the assistant looked a little troubled. He continued, “Miss, this...” ”

“What’s wrong? Is it difficult for me to get you information?”Qiu Di raised her head and asked.

“The assistant continued, “Young Miss, you don’t know. The last time I went to get information, the person-in-charge of the eight great families said, said...” ”

“Said what?”Qiu Di Glared at the assistant.

“The assistant looked at Qiu di and said, “He said that apart from Miss Ye, no one else has the right to look through the information on the interstellar case.” ”
