Chapter 89: 074: face-smacking with strength, stunning everyone! 3

[ Our Rong Rong is No. 1! Some shameless rookies, if you lose, don’t pretend to be a white lotus flower crying and acting pitiful. ]

[ waiting for Rong Rong to teach the white lotus flower how to behave! ]

[ the large-scale face-smacking scene is about to begin. Ahhhh, the video has already been recorded. Wait for Rong Rong to crush the rookies! ]

[ waiting for cheating dogs to repent and apologize! ]

[ I’m so excited! I’m so happy! ]

After the two sides had settled on their bet, the game began.

With the help of the system, Mu Yourong very carefully made her first move.

Ye Zao did not consider it and immediately placed a stone behind him.

Mu Yourong came menacingly.

In less than three minutes, she had eaten five of ye Zao’s stones.

On Ye Zao’s side, she actually did not eat a single stone and was at a disadvantage.

Mu Yourong smiled at Ye Zao. “The outcome has already been decided. I don’t think there’s a need to continue playing, right? If you continue playing, it will only be a waste of time.”

Ye Zao slowly placed a piece down and said in a shallow tone, “It’s not the end yet. Why are you in such a hurry?”

Mu Yourong curled the corners of her lips, “Since young miss is unwilling to give up until she reaches the Yellow River, then I will play with you until the end. However, even if I play until the end, it won’t change the outcome! “Miss, everyone makes mistakes. Even though you cheated before, your chess skills are still pretty good. “I’ve been playing chess for a few years, you don’t have to care so much about winning or losing.”

She had the top-tier chess skills given by the system.

What did ye Zhuo have? RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Even if she was different from before, she still couldn’t beat herself!

[ hahaha! Rong Rong is really amazing! ]

[ cheating dog is really shameless! It’s still struggling on the verge of death! ]

[ Rong Rong is awesome! ]

[ cheating dog, you only know how to waste time. Don’t you know that our Rong Rong’s time is very precious? ]

[ a loss is a loss. What’s the point of wasting time? ]

In the audience stands.

Li Qiandong only stared at the go game on the big screen and said in surprise, “Miss Mu is really too amazing! The God is going to lose, holy shit! Could it be that the god really cheated on the live broadcast last time?”

As he spoke, Mu Yourong ate another piece from ye Zao.

If ye Zao was really that amazing and could win against ye Zao, then she would not be at a complete disadvantage in this PK.

But now.

Ye Zao was not only at a complete disadvantage, he was completely defeated.

Faced with Mu Yourong’s powerful attack, she had no ability to counterattack.

This could only mean one thing.

Ye Zhuo had really cheated.

If she had not cheated, it would have been impossible for her to win against Mu Yourong so easily on the previous live broadcast.

“I really didn’t expect that the god would cheat...”Li Qiandong could not tell what he was feeling.

To be honest.

Ye Zhuo’s actions had really disappointed him a little.

Although it was normal to want to win, it was not right to cheat.

If everyone was like Ye Zhuo, wouldn’t the Chess Circle Be in chaos?

“She didn’t cheat.”A low voice sounded from the side. “Also, she won’t lose.”

Hearing this, Li Qiandong turned to look at Cen Shaoqing.

Cen Shaoqing was staring at the big screen with a faint smile in his eyes.

This person’s chess moves were still the same as before.

It seemed to be unorganized, but in reality, every step was filled with traps.

The slightest carelessness would cause one to fall into her trap.

Mu Yourong seemed to have the upper hand, but in reality, she had already walked step by step into her trap.

Seeing Cen Shaoqing like this.

Li Qiandong sighed helplessly.

He felt that Cen Shaoqing was bewitched.

Ye Zao was clearly about to lose.

Yet, he still believed that ye Zao would win...

Did he bring his own filter when he looked at ye Zao?

Although ye Zao was a big shot in science and Technology and was very powerful, cheating was cheating. Why did Cen Shaoqing choose to avoid it?

Could it be that if he did not admit it, Ye Zao did not cheat?

At this moment.

A clear and shallow voice sounded in the air.

“General! Senior M, thank you for letting me win.”After saying this, ye Zao moved the carriage in front of the commander.

At this moment, Mu Yourong’s commander was surrounded by soldiers on both sides. He could only advance forward and could not walk on either side.

Therefore, there was only one way to face Mu Yourong.

General ye Zao!

“Holy shit!”Li Qiandong felt as if his face had been ruthlessly slapped by someone.

Mu Yourong lost?

How Could Mu Yourong lose?

What was going on?

Ye Zao’s side had clearly been completely defeated and only one carriage was left to cross the river. On Mu Yourong’s side, there were still two cannons, two carriages, two horses...

This was also inconceivable!

If he had not seen it with his own eyes, he would never have believed that this was real.

What was this called?

A strong counterattack?

“Do you know what this is called in the game of Go?”Cen Shaoqing’s voice sounded a little faint. “This is called a blind eye that can not see Mount Tai. In chess, one can not win by eating many pieces. It emphasizes on strategy and brains.”
