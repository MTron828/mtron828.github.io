“Her husband had left early, and she had painstakingly raised her child by herself. Now that she was at an age where she should be enjoying her life, her son had treated her like this! ”

How could there be such a son in the world?

Fang yinyue!

This was all Fang yinyue’s fault!

“Old Madam Li continued, “Now, I’ll give you two choices. Either divorce Fang yinyue, or go to Cen Wuye and explain this matter clearly! It’s your choice!” ”

“Seeing that his mother was going overboard with her words, Li Sanzhu stood up from his chair. “Since you’ve already said so, I’ll tell you the truth! Li Shuyi brought this upon herself! She’s going to jail for sure!” ”

“Hearing this, old madam Li almost couldn’t catch her breath. ”

Unfilial Son!

“”What, what did you say! Say It Again!”Old Madam Li pointed at Li Sanzhu and asked. ”

“Li Sanzhu said, “I’ve said what I should say. Let’s leave it at that!” ”

“After saying that, Li Sanzhu turned around and left. ”

“Looking at Li Sanzhu’s back, Old Lady Li’s eyes were filled with disbelief. She had never thought that Li Sanzhu would treat her, his mother, so disrespectfully. ”

The previous Li Sanzhu was not like this!

Old Lady Li was so angry that she almost vomited blood. “Li Sanzhu! Stop right there!”

Li Sanzhu acted as if he didn’t hear her.

“”Li Sanzhu, if you don’t stop right there today, you’ll have to wait to collect your mother’s corpse!” ”

“After these harsh words were released, Li Sanzhu still didn’t stop. ”

Old Madam Li looked at Li Sanzhu’s back and her legs were unsteady. She fell onto the chair behind her and panted heavily.

Li Sanzhu walked all the way home.

“Seeing his angry face, Fang yinyue didn’t ask any more questions. Instead, she poured Li Sanzhu a glass of water. “Calm down. No matter what, she’s your mother and an elder. There’s no need to lower yourself to her level.” ”

Li Sanzhu turned to look at Fang yinyue. “Do you know what she just said to Me?”

“What did she say?”Fang yinyue asked.

“Li Sanzhu told Fang yinyue what had happened. He thought that Fang yinyue would be very angry, but unexpectedly, not only was Fang yinyue not angry, she was smiling instead. ”

“Li Sanzhu was furious. Seeing Fang yinyue like this, he said gloomily, “Aren’t you angry at all?” ”

“”If I knew your mother was such a person, why would I be angry?”Fang yinyue continued, “If I were like you, I would have been angry to death long ago!” ”

The disgusting things that Old Lady Li had done were not just these.

“Hearing this, Li Sanzhu’s eyes were filled with guilt. “I’m sorry, yinyue. I’ve let you suffer all these years.” ”

“Previously, Fang yinyue had also mentioned the matter of Old Lady Li beside him, but at that time, he had not taken it to heart. He had thought that the conflict between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law could not be avoided. He had only asked Fang yinyue to give way! ”

It was only until today that Li Sanzhu truly understood fang yinyue’s situation.

“At that time, Fang yinyue must have been even angrier than he was now! ”

“”There’s nothing to be wronged. It’s all in the past anyway.”As long as Li Sanzhu remembered how good she was, it was fine. Fang yinyue was not the kind of person who would not give up without reason. ”

Li Sanzhu sighed. “My mother was clearly not like this in the past.”

“”People change,”Fang yinyue said. ”

“After saying that, Fang yinyue continued, “Your mother has a good temper to begin with. This time, she said some harsh words to you. Why Don’t you go over and take a look? Otherwise, she might really do something!” ”

“”She’s making trouble without reason. What can I Do? !”Li sanzhu continued, “If something really happens to her, at most, I’ll just rest for a few more days and take care of the important matter! “She’s looking for death herself. What does that have to do with me?” ”

“If she were to follow Old Lady Li’s orders, Old Lady Li would definitely push her luck in the future! ”

“Seeing Li Sanzhu like this, Fang yinyue shook her head helplessly. ”

“At this moment, the phone rang in the living room. ”

“The maid walked over to pick up the phone. “Sir, it’s for you.” ”

Li Sanzhu walked over to pick up the phone.

“Very soon, Li Erzhu’s voice came from the other end of the phone. “Sanzhu, it’s bad! Mom Can’t take it anymore and is trying to hang herself. Quickly come over and apologize to mom and ask her to forgive you!” ”

“As Li Erzhu spoke, he turned to look at Linda and Old Madam Li, hinting for the two of them to make some noise. ”

“Seeing this, Linda immediately cried, “Mom, Mom, don’t Be Like This! If anything happens to you, what should we do?” ”

“”You let me die! Let Me Die! Anyway, there’s no point for me to live in this world!” ”
