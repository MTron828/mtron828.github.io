“Chapter 820: 179: face smacking. Lord Five: This is my girlfriend, ye Zao! 5”

Translator: 549690339

Or did ye Zao wear some special gloves on his hands?

“It should be like this, right? ”

“Although this was what she thought, Tang Xue still smiled and said, “Miss ye is really amazing.” ”

“It’s no big deal.”

Tang Xue’s expression did not change as she accompanied ye Zao to stroll around another place.

“In the blink of an eye, two hours had passed. ”

Ye Zhuo came to Cen Shaoqing’s side. “Have you not settled it yet?”

“Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly. “The problem from before has already been settled. Now, we have encountered a new and thorny problem. Why don’t I Get Cen Jiang to send you back first?” ”

“What problem? Can you let me take a look?”Ye Zhuo asked.

Professor Yue was about to speak when Cen Shaoqing nodded. “Sure.”

Cen Shaoqing then turned to Cen Jiang. “Go and bring the design over.”

“Okay.”

Professor Yue frowned slightly.

He felt that Cen Shaoqing was too hasty.

“This was research, not a game. What would a child like ye Zhuo know. ”

“Professor Yue adjusted his glasses and smiled at Ye Zhuo. “Miss Ye, have you graduated from university this year?” ”

“Not yet.”Ye Zhuo shook his head.

“She hadn’t even graduated from university, so how could she understand the scientific research design? ”

“Professor Yue turned to look at Cen Shaoqing. “Master Five, why don’t We Wait a little longer? We’ll talk about it when Zisu comes back.”Zisu was an expert in this area, and because she had other matters to attend to, she was temporarily not in the base. ”

“Let me take a look first.”

“At this moment, Cen Jiang came over with the design. “Miss Ye, here.” ”

Ye Zhuo took the design and smiled. “Do you have a computer for me to use?”

“Naturally, the computer in the laboratory could not be used by Ye Zhuo. Professor Yue said, “Cen Jiang, go get a computer.” ”

“Cen Jiang was about to speak when CEN Shaoqing continued, “Just use mine.” ”

“Here.”Cen Shaoqing held ye Zhuo’s hand and brought her to sit in front of his computer.

Nonsense.

This was simply nonsense. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Professor Yue’s face was full of worry.

Cen Shaoqing was too indulgent with ye Zao.

“According to the current situation, Cen Shaoqing would eventually be dragged down by ye Zao Step by Step One day. ”

Ye Zao turned on the computer and skillfully opened the electronic version of the design.

“In the next second, her ten fingers quickly jumped on the keyboard, and the air was full of crackling sounds. ”

Her actions confused the people beside her.

What was she doing?

Changing the design?

Or changing the data?

Everyone was an elite of the base. Everyone could tell at a glance if ye Zhuo was fixing the flaws in the design.

“At this moment, ye Zhuo was clearly messing around. ”

Playing some fake tricks.

Professor Yue’s eyes were filled with anger. Young people nowadays really didn’t know their limits.

“Pretending to know what they didn’t know, pretending to know what they didn’t know. ”

What was even more ridiculous was that he actually showed off his skills in front of a group of experts.

Love was indeed not a good thing.

“Cen Shaoqing was such a wise person, but he actually took a liking to ye Zhuo. ”

“Professor Yue tried his best to calm himself down and not lose his temper. After all, Ye Zhuo was Cen Shaoqing’s girlfriend. If he really lost his temper, wouldn’t it be embarrassing for Cen Shaoqing? ”

Tang Xue observed professor Yue’s expression without changing her expression.

“Fortunately, Ye Zao was Cen Shaoqing’s girlfriend. If ye Zao was not Cen Shaoqing’s girlfriend, Professor Yue would have flipped the table by now. ”

She originally thought that ye Zao was smart.

She did not expect that she had overestimated ye Zao in the end.

“As long as Ye Zao was smart, he would not mess around with the things in the laboratory. ”

Although ye Zao’s luck was indeed very good.

“However, fixing the flaws in the design was not something that could be done with just good luck. ”

This required real materials.

“Professor Yue looked at ye Zao and felt that his patience had reached its limit. To her, time was life. Every inch of time was precious. ”

Her time was not for ye Zao to waste.

“Professor Yue suppressed the dissatisfaction in his heart and tried his best to be tactful. “Miss Ye, if it’s not done well, we won’t trouble you. We’ll get someone to handle it later.” ”

Ye Zao released the mouse and looked up at her.

“Seeing that ye Zao did not make any next move, professor Yue heaved a sigh of relief. She was afraid that ye Zao would not be able to let go of his face and continue to waste his time. ”

“To professor Yue’s surprise, ye Zao continued, “I have already fixed all the loopholes. Professor Yue, see if there are any other problems.” ”

Fixed?

Professor Yue thought that he was hearing things.

How long had it been?

Three minutes.

She had solved it in just three minutes?

Impossible!

This was impossible!

“After saying this, ye Zao stood up from his chair. ”

“Professor Yue immediately sat in front of the computer and reached out to press the mouse. He flipped through the design and system data, his eyes filled with shock. ”

Three minutes.

Only three minutes.

Ye Zao had solved all the problems.

“Elder Zhao, who was standing behind Cen Shaoqing, was even more surprised. He looked up at ye Zao and said, “Miss Ye, you, you really haven’t graduated from University Yet?” ”

Ye Zao smiled slightly. “No.”

“”When a young man is strong, the country is strong.”Elder Zhao gave ye Zao a thumbs up. “Miss Ye, you’re really amazing! It looks like our generation is really going to retire!” ”

“You flatter me.”Ye Zao’s expression was indifferent. There was not a hint of complacency on his face. He was much more stable than his peers.

Professor Yue was still confused. She had never thought that ye Zao would fix the loophole.

But the truth was right in front of her.

She had no choice but to believe that it was true!

Tang Xue raised her head and looked at ye Zao.

She had thought that ye Zao was a Missy who did not know anything.

But now it seemed.

That was not the case.

But Ye Zao was only eighteen or nineteen years old.

She had not graduated from university yet.

How did she do it?

“If she was a genius, she would not still be in university. ”

Which genius did not skip a grade?

“In China, there were a lot of people who became phd professors at 18 or 19 years old. ”

But Ye Zao was still a university student.

This was too strange.

“Tang Xue had always thought that her talent was not bad, but compared to ye Zao, who could repair the design in three minutes, she was not just a little bit inferior. ”

“For a moment, Tang Xue’s heart was filled with countless thoughts. ”

“If she said that she did not feel uncomfortable, then it was definitely a lie. ”

She was older than ye Zao and had entered the industry earlier than ye Zao.

There was no reason for her to lose to Ye Zao...

“Cen Jiang looked at ye Zao excitedly. “Miss Ye, you’re really too amazing! From now on, you’re my goddess. Can I Shake Your Hand?” ”

“At this moment, Cen Jiang felt a chill at the back of his neck. He looked up and saw Cen Shaoqing’s death gaze. ”

“Cen Jiang immediately changed his words. “There’s no need to shake hands! Miss Ye, can you give me an autograph?” ”

Goddess?

“Upon hearing this term, Tang Xue looked at Cen Jiang. ”

“If she remembered correctly, she was still Cen Jiang’s goddess not long ago. ”

She did not expect that.

Things had changed so quickly.

“After today, how many people’s goddesses would ye Zhuo become? ”

“It should be everyone, right? ”

“A real goddess, a fake goddess, who would be able to tell the difference between real and fake? ”

“Even Cen Shaoqing wouldn’t be able to tell the difference, right? ”

“Who would have thought that in less than half a day, ye Zhuo had conquered the people of the experimental base? ”

“Ye Zhuo looked at Cen Jiang. “Do you have a pen?”Regarding the matter of signing autographs, Ye Zhuo was already familiar with it. ”

“”Yes!”Cen Jiang nodded and immediately took out a marker pen from his pocket. “Miss Ye, you can sign here.” ”

Ye Zhuo picked up the marker pen and signed Cen Jiang’s clothes.

“”Leader, shall we go back?”Cen Shaoqing looked at Ye Zhuo. ”

“Yes.”

What did Cen Shaoqing Call Ye Zhuo?

Leader?

Tang Xue narrowed her eyes.

Was this leader the leader she understood?
