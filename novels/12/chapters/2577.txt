“”Thank you.”An lizi smiled and said, “I also wish you can find your other half as soon as possible.” ”

“Yeah.”Li hang nodded. “I hope so too.”

“As he spoke, Li Hang had already grabbed an Lizi’s arm. “Lizi, time really flies! I remember when we were young, we even played house together!” ”

“Thinking back to the past, an Lizi was also filled with emotions. “Yeah.” ”

“Li hang chatted about other things before finally returning to the main topic. “Oh right, Lizi, I just saw a very strange person. Is she a relative of your family?” ” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Who?”An Lizi asked.

“Li hang said, “She’s about thirty years old. She dresses like a little child. I saw that everyone called her Miss Guanghua.” ”

“An Lizi said, “Oh, you mean Aunty Guanghua. She’s the daughter of my father’s old friend, and also the successor of the Soaring Enterprise.” ”

“The successor of the Soaring Enterprise?”Li hang widened his eyes in disbelief.

Successor?

A crazy woman?

“”Yeah.”An Lizi nodded. “Actually, Aunty Guanghua doesn’t have much of a problem. She’s just a little different from normal people.” ”

“Li hang smiled and said, “I see.” ”

“”Actually, when I first met Aunt Guanghua, I wasn’t used to it. After getting along with her for a long time, you’ll realize that she’s smarter than most people,”an Lizi continued. ”

“Really?”Li Hang asked.

“Yes.”

“Li hang turned his head and looked in the direction of Guanghua. He then said, “Oh right, Lizi, I have a favor to ask of you.” ”

“What is it?”An Lizi asked.

“Li hang scratched his head. “Actually, it was someone else who asked me.” ”

“Tell me.”

“Li hang continued, “Does your good friend Zhao pingting have a boyfriend?” ”

“”I don’t think so,”an Lizi replied. ”

“”That’s Great!”Li hang continued, “Wang Bin Fell in love with your good friend at first sight. He asked me to help him set up a connection. Can you help me ask your good friend’s opinion?” ”

“Hearing this, an Lizi immediately frowned. “Is Wang Bin Sick? Is it over?” ”

“”What’s Wrong?”Li Hang asked with some confusion, “Why did he suddenly have such a big reaction?” ”

“An Lizi said, “Go and tell Wang Bin to stop thinking about my friend!” ”

“What’s Going On?”Li Hang asked.

“Nothing much! It’s just that he’s not worthy!”An Lizi was not afraid of offending Wang Bin.

“If there weren’t so many people today, she would have kicked Wang bin out directly! ”

“Li hang narrowed his eyes, he smiled and said, “To be honest, I don’t like Wang bin very much either, but he’s our cousin! “You, it’s fine if you endure it, but at most, you won’t associate with people like him in the future! “Anyway, I won’t be living with him in the future, so I still have to work on my reputation.” ”

“At this moment, dog two walked in from outside. “Lizi!” ”

“”Here,”an Lizi answered. ”

“Dog two continued, “Auntie has something to talk to you about.” ”

“”I’m here,”an Lizi replied. Then, she looked at Li Hang. “Then, I’ll be leaving first.” ”

“Okay.”Li hang nodded.

An Lizi followed dog two’s footsteps and the two of them walked out.

“An lizi asked curiously, “Why did my mom call me?” ”

“Dog two smiled and said, “Auntie didn’t call you.” ”

An Lizi instantly reacted and reached out to pat dog two. “You’re good! You’re quite perceptive!”

“Actually, she really hated Li Hang. ”

“At a very young age, an Lizi had already discovered Li Hang’s hypocrisy. ”

“But she had no choice. After all, Li Hang was her cousin. Sometimes, they still had to maintain their relationship. Even if they didn’t respect the monk, they still had to respect Xia Xiaoman. ”

“”Of course.”Buttface continued, “I’m already at your house. When are you coming back to my house with me?” ”

An Lizi thought for a moment. “I’ll discuss it with my parents tonight.”

“Okay.”Buttface held an Lizi’s hand tightly. “It’s not a day or two that my parents want to see their future daughter-in-law.”

“”What if I’m not the ideal daughter-in-law for uncle and aunt?”An lizi continued, “The most difficult relationship in the world is that of a mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. I’m not good at pleasing others. If I have a conflict with your mother in the future, which side are you on?” ”

“”I’m on the side of the truth,”buttface said. ”

An Lizi was a little speechless. “Can’t you say that you’re on my side?”

“Buttface smiled and said, “Don’t worry. My mother is very easy to get along with. Moreover, she’s very busy. She’s busy with work and traveling. She absolutely has no time to create conflict with you! “Even if you two really have a conflict, I will help the truth and not the family.” ”

“Buttface’s mother was a typical career-oriented woman. It was said that on the day she gave birth to buttface, she was still busy discussing cooperation with others. Buttface was born in an ambulance. ”

“Can’t You Coax Me?”An Lizi asked.

“Buttface said very seriously, “This kind of thing will last a lifetime. If I really coax you with the tone of a little girl, it means that I am not worth marrying, so I won’t Coax You. “Every word I say to you now, every word, is from the bottom of my heart.” ”

“An lizi smiled and said, “You’re a straight man of Steel!” ”

A straight man who didn’t even know how to coax his girlfriend.

“Buttface said, “Straight men who give their girlfriends lipstick are all death Barbie fans. When have I ever given you death Barbie fans?” ”

“After saying that, buttface continued, “I heard from brother Ze that when master five was chasing after searing aring, not only did he give a bunch of death lipstick, but he also gave a bunch of pink dresses.” ”

“Ye Zao had also shared this matter with an Lizi and the others, so when an Lizi heard this, she immediately laughed out loud, “Yes, yes, yes, there was such a thing. At that time, I was laughing my head off! I always thought that this kind of steel straight man only existed in jokes!”Who would have thought that.., there was such a thing in reality, and it was even a pursuer of her good friend! ”

“Buttface continued, “So I’m still straight?” ”

“Just a little better than straight men.”An Lizi made a gesture.

“Buttface smiled and said, “Just a Little?” ”

“”What else do you think?”An lizi continued, “Although master five had a little bit of a straight man in the early stages, he corrected himself in time! Moreover, he stood unreservedly on burning great’s side.” ”

“”People are different from each other.”Buttface continued, “You just have to remember that I will never lie to you. I Won’t let you down.” ”
