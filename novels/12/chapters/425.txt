Already together?

“This isn’t an illusion, right? ”

The thousand-year-old monk has finally opened his eyes!

“As soon as these words were said, the air immediately fell silent. ”

Old Mrs. Cen and Zhou Xiang stared at each other. They could see the shock and excitement in each other’s eyes.

“Old Mrs. Cen was the first to react. She immediately threw away her chopsticks and walked to Cen Shaoqing’s side. She held Cen Shaoqing’s face with both hands and her face was filled with a kind smile, “Aiyo! My dear eldest grandson, did grandma hear wrongly? Did you really trick my dear granddaughter-in-law into your hands?” ”

Kiss my eldest grandson?

Cen Shaoqing raised his eyebrows slightly.

He suspected that there was something wrong with his ears.

“After all, before this, old Mrs. Cen had always called him ‘Smelly Kid’, ‘Big Pig Trotter’, and ‘sand sculpture toy’... ”

When had she ever treated him so well?

“Cen Shaoqing picked up the Buddha Pearl and said in a low voice, “Correction, it’s a chase, not a scam.” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen was so happy that she could not even see her eyes. “Yes, yes, yes, it’s not a scam! It’s a chase. Aiyo, my eldest grandson has finally understood. He could actually trick such a beautiful leaf.” ”

“Although Old Mrs. Cen was already mentally prepared that ye Zao would be her biological granddaughter-in-law, when Cen Shaoqing really managed to woo Ye Zao, she was still extremely excited! ”

That was ye Zao.

“In old Mrs. Cen’s eyes, Ye Zao was omnipotent. ”

The most beautiful ye Zao in the universe!

“Zhou Xiang still felt that all of this was a little unbelievable. He turned around and looked at Cen Shaoqing. “Shaoqing, you’re not fooling around with your grandmother and me, are you?” ”

Cen Shaoqing had been single for thirty-one years.

He had been a vegetarian for more than ten years.

Zhou Xiang had once thought that he would be a bachelor for the rest of his life.

Did he manage to woo her just like that?

“That shouldn’t be possible, right? ”

Cen Shaoqing raised his eyes slightly. “I’m not fooling around with you.”

Holy shit!

It was true!

“Zhou Xiang said in surprise, “Does that mean that searing hot is going to become my daughter-in-law soon? No, I have to immediately video chat with the eldest, second, third, and fourth brothers and tell them the good news!” ”

“”Don’t be anxious,”Cen Shaoqing said slowly. ”

“What’s Wrong?”Zhou Xiang happened to take out his phone.

Cen Shaoqing ate a mouthful of green vegetables. “I’m still in my internship period.”He was even more afraid that his passionate sisters would scare ye Zao.

“Especially his second sister, Cen Yueya. ”

She was practically the second old lady cen.

Internship period?

Old Lady Cen and Zhou Xiang were both stunned.

“Old Lady Cen frowned. “You’re a sand sculpture! You’re nothing! I thought I had already gotten Yezi, but after all this time, you’re just an intern!” ”

“Cen Shaoqing:”...”one second ago, he was kissing his eldest grandson, and the next, he was a sand sculpture. ”

“Heh, a woman. ”

“Zhou xiang smiled and said, “With Shaoqing’s blockhead, it’s already not bad if he can become an intern! An intern at least has the chance to become a full-time employee, but a normal friend doesn’t even have the chance to become a full-time employee.” ”

“Being comforted by Zhou Xiang, old Mrs. Cen’s mood was much better, she smiled and said, “That’s true. My granddaughter-in-law is so well-off. She’s beautiful, has a small waist, and has long legs. She should give this brat a taste of his own medicine! Let him know what it means to be arrogant for a moment and then chase his wife to the crematorium! I remember that some people used to swear that they would never get married!” ”

“At the end of her speech, old Mrs. Cen imitated the old Cen Shaoqing and said his classic words. ”

“”Mom, Grandma, do you think that the meaning of life is to marry and have children, then marry and have children, and so on until the end of Life?” ”

Zhou Xiang was amused by Old Mrs. Cen’s lively performance and burst into laughter. She could not even straighten her back.

“Cen Shaoqing ate the vegetables as if nothing had happened. His eyes and brows remained the same, as if he hadn’t seen anything. ”

“After a while, he put down his chopsticks. “Grandma, Mom, I’m done eating. I’m going to the office first.” ”

“”Stop right there, you little brat!” ”

Cen Shaoqing stopped in his tracks and looked back slightly. The sunlight shone in through the window and just happened to pass by his facial features.

Old Mrs. Cen was stunned.

She suddenly realized that this little brat of hers looked quite decent. No wonder he could become an intern.

“Do you still have something on?”Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips opened slightly.

“Only then did old Mrs. Cen React. She picked up the small stool at the side and walked to Cen Shaoqing’s side. Without saying a word, she stood on the small stool and reached out to Pat Cen Shaoqing’s shoulder, “I want to know now, does the face of some unmarried people hurt?” ”
