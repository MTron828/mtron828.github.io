Translator: 549690339

“The voice was very faint, but it was loud and powerful. It was as if it was tainted with a layer of magic power and could calm people’s hearts. ”

Everyone looked back one by one.

They saw that a ray of light suddenly lit up in the originally dark sealed space.

It was as if the dawn had shone into the darkness.

“”Miss Ye, it’s Miss Ye!” ”

“”That’s great! Miss Ye, we’ll Be Fine, right?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

The snow-white light seemed to coat her face with a faint halo.

“In an instant, everyone seemed to have found their backbone. ”

“Seeing this light, Si Lu slowly calmed down. Leaning against the elevator, he took a deep breath, as if he was exhausted. ”

“”Everyone, calm down. Listen to Miss Ye. Soon, a rescue team will come to save us!” ”

“A slightly chubby man squatted down and hugged his head with both hands. A sobbing voice sounded, “It’s no use. I just pressed the rescue button. This button is broken! There’s no signal in the elevator either. This is the tenth floor. If the elevator loses control and falls to the second floor, then we’re Dead!” ”

“”How can this be? Such a high-end hotel, and the button is actually a decoration. I want to complain to them!” ”

“Then what do we do now?”

“Once these words were said, the people who had already calmed down instantly became restless again. ”

“”It’s okay. My phone has a signal. Soon, someone will come over.”Ye Zhuo’s tone was light. He was not scared by the sudden change at all. ”

He was so calm that he did not look like a 20-year-old girl.

“”Miss Ye, are you serious? Your phone really has a signal?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Ye Zao’s phone looked ordinary, but it had been modified. No matter where it was, it would not lose its signal. ”

Creak —

“At this moment, a heavy sound came from the elevator box. ”

“This sudden sound, in the tense atmosphere of the elevator box, was particularly strange. ”

“It was as if the next second, the elevator would not be able to withstand it and fall down violently. ”

“At the same time, the elevator also began to shake. ”

It was like swinging on a swing.

“Everyone looked up at the top of the elevator, their eyes filled with fear. ”

“”What should we do? What should we do? Is it, is it going to fall down?” ”

“I don’t want to Die! I really don’t want to die!”

“Mom! Come and save me!”

“Dad! My Son is unfilial. I Can’t take one last look at you!”

The people they knew and didn’t know hugged each other and cried uncontrollably. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Ye Zao’s voice sounded again. “This is just the self-protection mode of the elevator when it malfunctioned. It Won’t fall.”

Creak —

“At this moment, the elevator door that was originally tightly shut suddenly opened. ”

Chi —

“It’s Open! It’s Open!”

“That’s great! We can get out!”

“Looking at the elevator door that was slowly opening, everyone was elated and broke into smiles. ”

But in the next second.

The smiles on everyone’s faces froze at the corners of their mouths.

“This was because after the elevator door opened, there wasn’t an exit outside, but a wall that faced everyone. ”

“After experiencing great sorrow, everyone became overjoyed because of the opening of the elevator doors. With great difficulty, they finally saw Hope, and the elation turned into great sorrow! ”

“How could this be?”

“Ah!”Someone could not help but burst into tears.

Chi —

The elevator sank down again.

The elevator doors dropped down a section.

“Coincidentally, this section revealed half of the exit. It was just enough to accommodate a person and climb out from inside. ”

“Shall we climb out?”

“This elevator is very spooky. What if the elevator door drops down again when we climb out?”

“I don’t dare to climb!”

“Neither do I!”

He was born a human.

Who Wasn’t afraid of Death?

“Some people were eager to try, but they withdrew their feet at the critical moment. ”

“If something happened to the elevator while they were climbing, the consequences would be unimaginable. ”

Si Lu pinched his fingers.

No.

He couldn’t just sit here and wait for death.

Si Lu walked out and climbed up.

“At this moment, someone grabbed his wrist. “Be careful!” ”

Si Lu was pulled down by a huge force.

At this moment.

Boom!

The elevator sank again.

There was another wall facing everyone.

“Seeing the lawyer being pulled down by ye Zao, everyone gulped. ”

Close call!

It was too close!

“If ye Zao had been a step slower, the lawyer would have been cut in half by the elevator. ”

The lawyer looked at the closed elevator door and took a deep breath.

After a long while.

The lawyer turned to look at Ye Zao. “Thank you.”
