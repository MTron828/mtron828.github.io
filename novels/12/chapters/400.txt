“Mu Yourong was so angry that her entire body was trembling. She did not expect that not only did Shen Rong not take the initiative to admit her mistake, but she also thought of a way to save Cen Shaoqing with her. Instead, she pushed all the responsibility onto her head! ”

What was this?

Was Shen Rong still worthy of being a mother?

“”Shut up!”Mu Yourong shouted hysterically. “Shut up! It’s all your fault! It’s all your fault! Nineteen years ago, you did not fulfill your obligation to raise me! Nineteen years later, you personally destroyed my good marriage! Why Don’t you all die!” ”

Shen Rong’s face immediately paled.

She had never thought that Mu Yourong would say such a thing to her.

Was this person in front of her really her daughter?

Even ye Zao knew to kowtow and kneel before the Mu family when he left to thank them for their many years of nurturing!

“Shen Rong did not quite understand why mu yourong had suddenly become like this, with red eyes, she said, “Yourong! You, how can you say such things about your father and me? It’s not like we intentionally carried the wrong child! Do you think we want that?” ”

“Mu Yourong looked at Shen Rong, and a terrifying thought suddenly flashed through her mind. What would happen if Shen Rong directly disappeared? ”

Shen Rong had disappeared.

She was the only person left in this world…

“The Cen family and the Mu family had been friends for many years. The Cen family definitely could not bear to leave her alone to face life. Perhaps, they might even be soft-hearted enough to bring her back. ”

“At that time, she would still be Cen Shaoqing’s fiancée. ”

“After all, it was not her wish to break off the engagement at that time! ”

“Thinking of this, Mu Yourong’s expression changed. She cried, “I’m sorry, Mom, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to make you angry! I just feel too uncomfortable! Mom, I hope that you can understand me…” ”

“”It’s okay, it’s okay!”As a mother, Shen Rong would not blame her child. She quickly reached out and hugged mu yourong, “Good child, it’s fine! Mother Won’t Blame You! Just treat it as if you and Cen Shaoqing are fated to be apart! There are so many good men in the world, and you are so outstanding. I believe that you will meet a better man in the future!” ”

“Hearing this, Mu Yourong’s eyes flashed. Other than Cen Shaoqing, what good man was there in this world? ”

She wanted to marry Cen Shaoqing!

She had to marry Cen Shaoqing!

Those who prevented her from marrying Cen Shaoqing were all stumbling blocks!

All stumbling blocks!

“Mu yourong continued, “Mother, you haven’t eaten yet, right? I’ll go and Cook for you.” ”

“In her previous life, in order to please song Shiyu. ”

“Some time before her marriage, she had painstakingly practiced her culinary skills. ”

“When she ate the food that her daughter had personally cooked, Shen Rong instantly felt no anger in her heart. ”

The next morning.

“Mu Yourong woke up early and put on some light makeup. Then, she went to the market to buy some bones to make soup. ”

“When she returned, Shen Rong was sitting on the sofa playing mahjong with her phone. ”

“Mu Yourong poured a glass of water for Shen Rong. “Mom, drinking a glass of water in the morning can help soothe your intestines.” ”

Shen Rong took the water and drank it in one gulp.

“Mu Yourong narrowed her eyes, then, she said, “Oh right, Mom, I have something to do outside. I’m making bone soup on the gas stove. After an hour, please remember to turn off the fire. I Won’t be back for lunch. Please make do with some bone soup.” ”

“Okay.”Shen Rong nodded.

“Mu Yourong took her bag and went out. Before she went out, she even looked back at the bone soup on the stove. ”

“She had arranged to meet Li Qiandong. At this moment, Li Qiandong was standing downstairs waiting for her. ”

“Li Qiandong was Cen Shaoqing’s good brother. Right now, she had to tightly grab hold of Li Qiandong as a stepping stone. ” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Li Qiandong felt especially guilty when he saw Mu Yourong. She was currently at a low point in her life, but he could not help her in any way. ”

…

On the other side.

Cen Shaoqing and Ye Zhuo had arranged to meet at 10:30 on the Winding Mountain Highway.

It was only eight o’clock when he ziteng arrived at the CEN residence. Old Mrs. Cen was watching the Huangmei Opera in the living room.

“When she saw he ziteng, old Mrs. Cen thought she was seeing things. “Little he? !” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen.”

“Old Mrs. Cen asked curiously, “When did you come to Yun Jing?” ”

“He ziteng said, “I just arrived yesterday! By the way, where’s fifth brother?” ”

Old Mrs. Cen looked at the clock on the wall. “He’s upstairs working out in the gym!”

“I’ll go up and look for him.”He ziteng ran upstairs.

Cen Shaoqing was indeed working out in the gym.

“Unlike his usual long-sleeved shirt, he was currently naked, revealing his strong chest, eight-pack ABS, and perfect mermaid line. ”

His body was covered in a thin layer of sweat.

He was bursting with hormones!

Even a professional fitness trainer would be surprised to see him.
