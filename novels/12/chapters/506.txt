Old Mrs. Cen controlled her urge to hit him. “My granddaughter-in-law scored 749 points in her college entrance exam! What was that so-called Xianxian’s score?”

Old Mrs. Lin suddenly fell silent. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Compared to her score, Feng Xianxian seemed to be slightly worse. ”

“After saying that, old Mrs. Cen asked again, “Does that so-called Xianxian know Chinese Medicine?” ”

“”No,”old Mrs. Lin answered. ”

“Then does she know how to build robots?”

“No.”

“Does she know how to program?”

“No.”

“Does she know how to design?”

“No.”

“Does she know how to catch snakes with her bare hands?”

“No.”

“...”

“Old Mrs. Cen asked more than ten questions in a row, but Old Mrs. Lin’s answer was no. ”

“”I’m sorry, my granddaughter-in-law knows all this!”Old Mrs. Cen said with a proud face. ”

“She doesn’t know anything, and she still wants to compete with her precious granddaughter-in-law? ”

Nothing!

“Old Mrs. Lin:”...”May I ask if your granddaughter-in-law is a God? Old Mrs. Lin felt that old Mrs. Cen was bragging. After all, this person loved to brag when he was young! ”

How could there be an all-rounder in this world?

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Don’t blame me for not reminding you. That little girl just now used sweet words. One look and you can tell that she’s not an honest and good child. She can’t even be compared to the little finger of my granddaughter-in-law! “You have to be careful. She’s already so old! “Can’t you be a little more careful? “All day long, your own grandson doesn’t get close to you. To get close to an outsider! “I don’t know what you’re after!” ”

Loneliness?

“Old Mrs. Lin felt that old Mrs. Cen was trying to sow discord, “Xianxian was taught very well by Qianhua. She’s a good child, so don’t think too much of her! Also, although I’ve never met your granddaughter-in-law, I can feel that she’s not suitable for Shaoqing!” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen stood up in a Huff and placed her hands on her hips. “Are you saying bad things about my granddaughter-in-law? Be careful, or I’ll turn hostile and show you!” ”

“”Look, Look! I haven’t even said a word, and you’re already like this!”Old Mrs. Lin continued, “Your Shaoqing is a vegetarian, Xianxian is also a vegetarian, Xianxian is both talented and beautiful, and she’s worthy of your Shaoqing!” ”

“”In this world, other than my granddaughter-in-law, no one is worthy of Shaoqing! No, that’s not right! If you say that you’re not worthy, it’s because Shaoqing isn’t worthy of my granddaughter-in-law!”Old Mrs. Cen picked up the dragon-headed walking stick, “Take care of yourself! I’m going back First!” ”

“No wonder Lin Jincheng stayed in the sanatorium all year round. With such a mother, no one would be able to stand it. ”

Old Mrs. Lin felt that old Mrs. Cen was too old and muddle-headed to argue with her.

“If Old Mrs. Cen was not old and muddle-headed, why would she say such nonsense about how Shaoqing was not worthy of the woman. ”

“As soon as Old Mrs. Cen returned home, Zhou Xiang asked, “Mom, you went to the Lin Family? How is Old Mrs. Lin Doing?” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen said angrily, “Nothing much. I think she has Alzheimer’s.” ”

“Alzheimer’s?”Zhou Xiang was stunned. “It’s that serious?”

“Old Mrs. Cen nodded as if it was a serious matter, “Deaf, blind, and impervious to salt and oil, how can it not be serious? Xiangxiang, if I Have Alzheimer’s in the future and become as deaf and blind as Zhao fangyue, please don’t show mercy and hit me hard to wake me up!” ”

Zhou Xiang was still immersed in the news of Old Lady Lin Getting Alzheimer’s.

“She was somewhat puzzled. Old Lady Lin was such a shrewd person, how could she get Alzheimer’s? ”

...

Lin Jincheng’s car soon stopped in front of the hospital.

The father and son got out of the car and walked into the hospital.

Lin Ze originally thought that Lin Jincheng came to the hospital to hang the surgery department to look at the injuries on his face.

He did not expect Lin Jincheng to come directly to the identification department.

“When Lin Jincheng handed two strands of hair to the doctor, Lin Ze realized what Lin Jincheng was trying to do. He said angrily, “Dad! You Don’t believe my mom?” ”

He did not expect that Lin Jincheng would not believe ye Shu!

“When he thought of the nineteen years ye Shu had waited for him, Lin Ze felt very uncomfortable! ”

“Lin Jincheng’s voice was very calm. “It’s not that I don’t believe your mom, but I want to give your mom an explanation.”Ye Zao looked so much like him. How could he not believe ye Shu? ”

“He was already very regretful now. At that time, he did not understand the truth and misunderstood ye Shu. ”

He and ye Shu missed nineteen years because of the misunderstanding.

“For the rest of his life, Lin Jincheng did not want to see ye Shu suffer a little bit of injustice. ”

“This matter started because of a paternity test, but also because of the end of the paternity test. Old Lady Lin was stupid and stubborn. Without the paternity test, she would not believe that ye Shu did not cheat! ”
