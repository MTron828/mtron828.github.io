“Why are you such a hypocrite!”

Cen Shaoqing chuckled. “You’re the one who insisted on asking.”

Ye Zhuo gently pinched Cen Shaoqing’s face.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “It’s okay. My eyelashes are so long and I’m so handsome. I’m still your boyfriend!” ”

“”Mr. Cen, when did you become so narcissistic?”Ye Zhuo chuckled. ”

“”Because I trained my girlfriend well,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

Ye Zao:”…”How did she manage to train such a boyfriend.

She did not know since when she could not beat Cen Shaoqing.

Cen Shaoqing was clearly not like this in the past.

“After a moment, ye Zao put down the sunscreen and continued, “It’s done.” ”

“Is it done?”Cen Shaoqing opened his eyes.

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

Cen Shaoqing stood up. “Then I’ll be leaving first.”

“Go.”

Cen Shaoqing walked out of the house.

The driver was already waiting.

Cen Shaoqing walked straight into the back seat.

The car sped along and soon stopped in front of an ancient courtyard house.

The buildings in the South China Sea were more uniform and rarely had a courtyard house.

“However, this courtyard house was at least a hundred years old. ”

“The car had just stopped when a middle-aged man, who looked like a butler, walked out of the car. He looked at Cen Shaoqing and bowed respectfully. “CEN Fifth Master.” ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“The butler continued, “Follow me.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing followed the butler’s footsteps and passed through the hall, arriving at the tea room in the backyard. ”

“The tea room was decorated very elegantly and quietly. The beaded curtains jingled, and the room was still filled with the faint fragrance of tea. ”

Anyone who was proficient in the way of tea would definitely be able to smell it. This was the purple mountain tea from the peak of the Cloud Mountain.

The purple mountain tea was especially precious. It was so precious that it could be compared to the environment. It was sold in grams.

“Moreover, it was not something that could be bought with money. ”

“”Zixu.”Suddenly, a pleasant male voice came from inside. “You’re 15 minutes late.” ”

Cen Shaoqing lifted the pearl curtains and came to the tea room. He sat opposite the man. “Is that so?”

The man pointed at the clock hanging on the wall.

It was exactly 15 minutes from the appointed time.

Cen Shaoqing picked up a cup of tea and took a sip.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

It tasted bitter and sweet. It was a good tea!

“When did you come back?”Cen Shaoqing put down the Teacup and asked.

“”Half a month ago.”The man continued, “You were never late before.” ”

“That was before.”Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted.

“You’ve changed.”The man looked up at Cen Shaoqing.

Cen Shaoqing was noncommittal. “People change.”

The man frowned slightly. “Have you really found a girlfriend?”

“Not a girlfriend.”Cen Shaoqing corrected him. “Fiancée.”

A girlfriend and fiancée were two different concepts.

“Are you serious?”The man looked at Cen Shaoqing with disbelief in his eyes.

“Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and continued, “It’s time for you to find one.” ”

“Hearing this, the man frowned and said, “I will never get married.” ”

He did not need a woman

Cen Shaoqing shook his head gently.

The man sitting opposite him was called Yu Niannian.

He was Cen Shaoqing’s good friend when he was listening to Buddhist music in the temple ten years ago.

“Just like Cen Shaoqing, Yu Niannian had seen through the secular world and wanted to become a monk. ”

The only thing different from Cen Shaoqing was that Yu Niannian did not mind eating and there was no lack of women around him. He just felt that there was no woman in the world who was worthy of him.

Even less qualified to enter the hall of marriage with him.

“To him, a woman was just a piece of clothing and a pair of shoes. ”

“When he felt that it was no longer interesting, he could throw it away and change into a new pair. ”

His life should not be restricted by just one woman.

“In order to prevent himself from being blackmailed by women, he even went to have a vasectomy in his old age. However, every time he had sex with those women, he still pretended to use contraception. ”

“Over the years, there were many women who made him like a father. ”

“Therefore, he felt that women were not good things. They were all obstacles in the way of success for men. ”

“Why are you shaking your head?”Yu sunset asked.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “You will regret it.” ”

“Regret what?”Yu sunset asked.

“Regret what you said and did today.”

“After all, the former CEN Shaoqing was more confident than the current Yu sunset. ”

“In the end, he still fell in love and could not extricate himself. ”

“If time could be reversed, he would definitely not be so confident. ”

“Hearing this, Yu sunset laughed out loud. “How is that possible!” ”

“Why is it impossible?”Cen Shaoqing asked back.

“Yu sunset continued, “Zixu, I have seen more women than you wear clothes. I know women better than you! Women are all trouble. Just play with them. Don’t get serious with them! If you’re nothing, they won’t even look at you.” ”
