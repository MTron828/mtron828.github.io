“Chapter 1430: 306: face-smacking, Big Burning Domineering cover-up! 4”

Ye Zhuo bypassed the abandoned factory and walked all the way to the main gate of the base.

“Because the Cen family’s base made secret weapons and had signed a confidentiality agreement, the entire base’s address had been crossed off the map. That was why they had built an abandoned factory in front of the base to cover their tracks. ”

Area C.

Tang Xue brought Professor Yue and the base’s two elders to the construction warehouse.

These two people were elder Wu and elder Zhao.

Professor Yue’s expression was very ugly. “Where’s Cen Jiang? call him over!”

“Cen Jiang was the head of the large C area. Without Ye Zhuo, he was the head of the large C area. ”

“Since such a big incident had happened, he naturally had to look for Cen Jiang immediately. ”

“Now that the entire large C area had gone to the nuclear reactor, the matter was already in a mess. Professor Yue, Tang Xue, and elder Wu and elder Zhao had appeared at this time. It was obvious what they were here for, the assistant said with some embarrassment, “Professor Yue, I’m really sorry. Our district chief is not here right now. Please wait for a moment!” ”

“”Wait for a Moment?”Professor Yue’s face turned cold. “Do you know the consequences of a nuclear reactor leak? At that time, our entire base will suffer! Can you bear the consequences?” ”

She had long known that ye Zao’s space carrier plan would go awry. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“A little girl, who had just turned 20 years old, was lucky enough to get first place in the science and technology competition, but she already thought that she could build a space carrier! ”

Wasn’t this a fantasy?

Why would she use a nuclear reactor as raw material.

This was simply nonsense!

“Country C was the most technologically advanced country in the world. It had built a space carrier 30 times, but had not succeeded in ascending to heaven. What about a 20-year-old girl like her? ”

“Most importantly, other countries used nuclear power or fuel oil as fuel to build their aircraft carriers. ”

Professor Yue now suspected that ye Zao did not understand aircraft carriers at all. She was just talking on paper and joking about the resources of the CEN base.

“The assistant was shocked by Professor Yue. “Professor Yue, don’t worry. I’ll Contact District Chief Cen right away.” ”

“About a minute or two later, Cen Jiang came running over in his isolation suit. ”

“”Professor Yue, Elder Zhao, elder Wu! Why are you here?” ”

“Elder Wu, who had been silent all this while, opened his mouth. “Dajiang, where’s Miss Ye?” ”

“Miss Ye isn’t here yet.”

“Did you inform her?”Professor Yue continued to ask.

Cen Jiang nodded. “We did.”

“Then why isn’t she here yet?”Professor Yue narrowed his eyes.

A glimmer flashed across Tang Xue’s eyes. Could it be that ye Zao heard that the nuclear reactor had malfunctioned and did not dare to come?

“However, thinking about it, it was normal. If the nuclear reactor was leaked, ye Zao would be in Big Trouble! ”

“Cen Jiang continued, “Miss Ye is already on her way.” ”

“Tang Xue said, “District head CEN, could it be that your miss ye was scared away when she heard this news?” ”

“No.”Cen Jiang trusted ye Zhuo very much. “Miss Ye isn’t that kind of person.”

“Tang Xue continued, “I was just joking. Don’t take it seriously. In the entire base, who doesn’t know that Miss Ye isn’t the kind of person who would run away at the last minute! I also believe that she wouldn’t run away!” ”

“Cen Jiang could hear the hidden meaning behind Tang Xue’s words, but now wasn’t the time to argue. ”

“Professor Yue continued, “Quickly bring us to the nuclear reactor to take a look.” ”

“Cen Jiang nodded. “Everyone, follow me.” ”

The few of them followed Cen Jiang’s footsteps.

“Before long, they arrived at the nuclear reactor storage room. ”

“Under normal circumstances, nuclear reactors were built underwater because that was the only way to reach a critical point. ”

“But when the Cen family opened the door to the storage room, the few of them were shocked. Their faces were filled with disbelief. ”

“In the center of the storage room, there was a huge nuclear reactor apparatus. Through the apparatus, one could see that there was a scary blue light inside. The alarms on the apparatus were all red, there was a possibility of explosion leakage at any time. ”

“Seeing this situation, professor Yue’s face turned pale. “Nonsense! Nonsense! Who told you to reserve a nuclear reactor like this? Aren’t you waiting for something to Happen?” ”

“After saying that, professor Yue continued, “Cen Jiang, quickly arrange for someone to activate the emergency button. Seal the entire storage room and speed up the operation of the nuclear reactor!” ”

Speed up the operation of the nuclear reactor?

Professor Yue’s action was to shut down the nuclear reactor.

“Because the entrance to the nuclear reactor was not closed. Even if it was closed, the nuclear fission was still going on. Therefore, what they needed to do now was to speed up the operation and consume all the nuclear materials before the leak, in order to achieve a true shutdown! ”
