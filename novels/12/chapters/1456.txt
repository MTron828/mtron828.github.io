“Fourth aunt.”

“Fourth aunt.”

Ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing called out at the same time.

“At this moment, Ye Sen walked over from the side and grabbed Cen Shaoqing’s wrist. “Shaoqing, come over here. We just happen to be one person short of playing mahjong!””

Playing Mahjong?

“Cen Shaoqing touched his nose. “That uncle, I don’t know how to play Mahjong.””

“Before Cen Shaoqing met ye Zao, his biggest hobby in his free time was to recite Buddhist sutras or go to a temple to live.”

As for playing mahjong.

He really didn’t know how to.

“You don’t know how to play Mahjong?”Ye Sen was stunned. “How can a man not know how to play mahjong! Let Me Teach You!”

Ye Shu patted ye Sen on the side. “Don’t spoil the child!”

“In Ye Shu’s eyes, a man who didn’t Gamble and didn’t go whoring was a good man.”

Cen Shaoqing was very suitable for her son-in-law.

“After all, in this world, there really weren’t many men who didn’t even know how to play mahjong.”

“”Don’t worry, sister, I know what to do!”Ye Sen continued to pull Cen Shaoqing. “Go, go, go, Shaoqing, let’s go over there!””

Cen Shaoqing followed ye Sen to the side.

“Sitting at the table were Lin Qingyang’s youngest son, Lin Zhong, and Lin Qingyun’s third son, Lin Zhao. With Ye Sen, it just so happened that one of the three was missing.”

“”Seventh cousin, little cousin,”Cen Shaoqing called out politely.”

“Lin Zhao and Lin Zhong were already used to being called brother by someone older than them. They smiled and said, “Shaoqing, come! Oh right, where’s little twelve?””

“CEN Shaoqing said, “Zao is over there talking to fourth aunt.””

Lin Zhao nodded.

Cen Shaoqing sat down on the chair.

“Ye Sen also sat down immediately. “Shaoqing, I’ll tell you about the rules of Mahjong in a while!”After saying that, he looked at Lin Zhao and Lin Zhong. “This is Shaoqing’s first time playing mahjong. You two have to be more tolerant!””

“Lin Zhao and Lin Zhong were a little surprised. “Shaoqing, you don’t even know how to play Mahjong?””

“I’ve never played it before.”

“Lin Zhong continued, “If you hadn’t met our little twelve, wouldn’t you have really become a monk?””

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

Lin Zhong had previously thought that the rumors were a little unbelievable.

“Who would really give up their wealth to become a monk, especially a person of high status like Cen Shaoqing.”

“Now, they really believed him!”

“Otherwise, would cen Shaoqing not even know how to play mahjong?”

“Ye Sen told Cen Shaoqing about the rules of Mahjong. “Shaoqing, do you understand?””

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Almost.”

“”Since you understand, let’s begin!””

“The few of them took advantage of CEN Shaoqing’s newness and won three rounds in a row. Lin Zhong raised his head to look at Ye Sen, “Uncle, why don’t we start from the bottom? We won’t play with money anymore. We’ll play with turtles and lose one round. Everyone draw a stroke on each other’s faces. After that, we’ll take photos and post them on wechat Moments!””

Drawing turtles on CEN fifth master’s face and posting them on wechat moments made Lin Zhao very excited.

“Hearing this, Lin Zhao immediately nodded. “I agree with Ah Zhong’s words!””

“Ye Sen turned to Cen Shaoqing. “Shaoqing, what about you?””

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“”Then it’s decided.”Ye Sen continued, “I’ll start drawing turtles from the bottom.””

Half an hour later.

“There were two little turtles in the forest. He looked at Ye Sen with a sad face. “Uncle, are you sure that Shaoqing is a newbie?””

How could a newbie play so well?

“At first, they wanted to draw a few little turtles on Cen Shaoqing’s face.”

“Unexpectedly, Cen Shaoqing’s face was still clean, but there were two little turtles on their faces.”

“Ye Sen also lost miserably. He looked up at Cen Shaoqing and asked, “Did you secretly record the cards?””

“Cen Shaoqing raised his eyebrows slightly and asked curiously, “There are only 108 cards in total. Do I need to record them?””

Ye Sen:”...”are you still human?

Why are these two so perverted!

Ye Sen suddenly remembered the first time ye Zhuo went home and went to the casino with him.

In a flash.

So much time had passed

On the other side.

Ye Zhuo was sitting on the sofa and chatting with Xia Xiaoman.

“Recalling that Xia Xiaoman had asked her about the baby and even prescribed some pregnancy medication, ye Zhuo lowered his voice and said, “Fourth aunt, how are your medications?””

“In fact, if ye Zhuo had not asked, Xia Xiaoman would have taken the initiative to ask. She really wanted to have a child with Lin Qingxuan, but it had been such a long time and she had taken the medication, but her body had not responded. If this continued.., xia Xiaoman was starting to doubt whether she had some hidden illness!”Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates
