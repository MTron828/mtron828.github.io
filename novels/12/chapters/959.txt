“At that moment, the driver thought that he was about to become a murderer.”

He didn’t expect that the little girl sitting in the front passenger seat would suddenly make a move. That was why the car stopped steadily and didn’t hit anyone.

“As long as he thought of the scene just now, the driver’s heart would not stop thumping, and cold sweat dripped down his forehead.”

The Girl in the passenger seat was very young.

“Her side profile was exquisite and clear, and the dim yellow light in the car coated her face with a faint halo. Although she had just saved someone, there was no obvious change of expression on her face, not even the slightest ripple.”

“She was wearing a simple white sweater, but it gave people the illusion of a gorgeous dress.”

Rulan’s temperament also carried a bit of unruly bandit aura.

“Beautiful, but also gorgeous.”

“The girl looked back slightly, revealing a face that looked like a painting. Her tone was shallow. “You’re welcome.””

“The driver continued, “Little girl, What’s Your Name? Are you from Beijing University? I’ll definitely give you a brocade flag tomorrow!”Other than giving a brocade flag, the driver could not find a better way to express his gratitude.”

“”No need.”Ye Zhuo continued, “It was just a matter of convenience.””

“Although it was just a matter of convenience for ye Zhuo, to the driver, it was a life-saving grace.”

“If she had not acted in time, he would have been brought to the police station for questioning.”

“Moreover, it was the kind where one body and two lives were lost.”

“Little girl...”

“The driver wanted to say something more, but ye zhuo reminded him, “Be careful of the car in front.””

The driver immediately turned his head and looked ahead. He turned the steering wheel and avoided the car in front.

“On the other side, Cen Yuyan arrived at Zhou Rui’s residence.”

The house was still the same as when she left.

Cen Yuyan truly wanted to live with Zhou Rui.

“Therefore, from the day they received their marriage certificate, she began to seriously decorate their home.”

It was a three-bedroom house with a living room. Every piece of decoration was personally chosen by her.

“She did not expect that one day, she would leave this place in such a way.”

“In fact, she had never thought of leaving Zhou Rui and this home.”

“Back then, she was so happy when she was busy decorating this house. Now, she felt disgusted.”

Yes.

Disgusted.

So disgusting that it made people want to throw up.

Cen Yuyan couldn’t stay here for even a second. She picked up the password box and started to pack up her things.

“After living here for more than four months, CEN Yuyan really had a lot of things that belonged to her.”

“The things that she brought with her were all packed into her suitcase. If she couldn’t take them with her, she would pack them up and throw them into the trash can.”

“When she packed up the big diamond ring that Zhou Rui gave her, Cen Yuyan originally wanted to throw the diamond ring away.”

“But after thinking about it, she still did not throw it away.”

“Right now, she was in need of money, so she could not throw things away!”

“Half an hour later, Cen Yuyan packed up all her things and pulled her suitcase out of the residential area. She got into a taxi and said, “Master, please go to Boyi Hospital.””

Boyi Hospital was a private hospital. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Cen Yuyan wanted to have an abortion at a regular hospital, but she needed her family members to sign it. Now that she had caused such a ruckus with her family, she was too embarrassed to go back and ask them to sign it for her.”

“So, she could only go to a private hospital.”

“Very soon, the car stopped at Bo Yi Hospital.”

“As long as the money was in place, the private hospital could immediately arrange for the surgery.”

“As soon as CEN Yuyan entered the hospital, the Doctor arranged for her to have the surgery.”

“Before the surgery, she needed to undergo a series of examinations. Although it was a private hospital, the doctor was still very ethical, she held the report sheet and said, “Miss Cen, the fetus is currently very healthy and is developing very well. Moreover, it’s a boy. Are you sure you don’t want it?””

“I don’t want it.”Cen Yuyan shook her head. There was not a trace of longing in her eyes.

“She did not like children to begin with. If it was not for Zhou Rui, she would have aborted the child long ago.”

“Now that she had seen through Zhou Rui’s true colors, she naturally would not keep the child.”

“The doctor continued, “Then why don’t You Sign Your Name Here?””

Cen Yuyan took the pen and quickly signed her name.

“Perhaps it was because the mother and son were connected by heart. After signing, Cen Yuyan felt the little life in her stomach kick her.”

Cen Yuyan was stunned and tears instantly welled up in her eyes.

Had she ever looked forward to this little life?

“As a mother, the moment she decided to keep him, she had looked forward to the day this child was born.”

But now...

This child could not be kept.

Thousands of words turned into three words.

I’m sorry.

“The doctor seemed to have seen Cen Yuyan’s hesitation. “Miss Cen, the surgery hasn’t started yet. If you regret it, it’s still not too late.””
