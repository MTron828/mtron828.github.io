“Chen Siyao looked at doctor Liu and said calmly, “You’re not me.” ”

“Doctor Liu wasn’t her, so she couldn’t empathize with her. ”

“Material life wasn’t important to her at all. As long as she could be together with song Shiyu, she could do anything. ”

Even if it was eating chaff and eating vegetables.

“Doctor Liu Sighed. “Sometimes, I really wish that I could develop a real love-forgetting water so that you guys can walk out of love!” ”

“”Doctor Liu,”Chen Siyao looked up at doctor Liu and continued, “Then you’re really wrong.” ”

“Even if there really was love forgetting water, she wouldn’t drink it. ”

“Even if it was a one-sided love, she would drink it willingly. ”

Doctor Liu shook his head helplessly.

He really couldn’t understand these people.

“Doctor Liu continued, “Miss Chen, you only have one life. If something really happens to you, you really won’t be able to see boss song anymore! Could it be that you’re willing to part with Boss Song?” ”

He could finally see that there was only one song Shiyu left in Chen Siyao’s life now.

“Apart from Song Shiyu, she couldn’t hear anything else. ”

“Hearing this, Chen Siyao was stunned. ”

She couldn’t bear to let go.

She hoped that she could see song Shiyu every minute of her life.

But she couldn’t let go of the child and get trapped!

She had to make up her mind.

“”Doctor Liu, there’s no need to say anymore.”Chen Siyao closed her eyes tiredly. “You can go. I’m tired.” ”

“”Miss Chen, I’m a doctor! How can I just leave in your current condition?”Dr. Liu asked. ”

Chen Siyao closed her eyes. “I refuse treatment.”

“Then, she continued, “Little Xu, send the guest out.” ”

Little Xu walked forward and looked at Dr. Liu with a troubled expression.

“Chen siyao said again, “Send the guest out!” ”

“Little Xu could only bite the bullet and say, “Dr. Liu, please.” ”

“”Miss Chen!”Doctor Liu frowned and said, “You’re not responsible for yourself, and you’re not responsible for your family!” ”

Chen Siyao didn’t say anything else.

“She had already achieved her goal, so it was unintentional for her to say anything more. ”

“Little Xu continued, “Doctor Liu, Please!” ”

“Helpless, doctor Liu could only turn around and walk out. ”

“When he reached the door, Little Xu lowered his voice and said, “Doctor Liu, you’ve seen our eldest Miss’s situation. There’s only one way to save our eldest miss now.” ”

“What Way?”Doctor Liu asked.

“Little Xu turned to look at the room and continued, “Our eldest miss has a mental illness. We need to treat it appropriately.” ”

What kind of medicine was needed for a mental illness?

“Of course, it was a heart medicine! ”

“Doctor Liu seemed to understand something, but he didn’t seem to understand anything. ”

“After a while, little xu continued, “Doctor Liu, please tell third master the truth about our eldest miss’situation when you go back. As long as third master can come, our eldest miss will definitely be fine!” ”

Doctor Liu suddenly came to a realization.

He finally knew why Chen Siyao invited him but didn’t let him treat her!

It turned out that Chen Siyao’s real goal was song Shiyu!

“Doctor Liu nodded. “Okay, don’t worry. I’ll definitely explain Miss Chen’s condition to boss song!” ”

“”Then I’ll have to trouble you, doctor Liu,”little Xu said. ”

“Doctor Liu continued, “It’s just a small matter. Saving a life is better than building a seven-storied pagoda.” ”

“After that, doctor Liu added, “If you have time, you should also try to persuade Miss Chen. She’s just a man. In this world, good men are everywhere. There’s no need for her to hang herself on a tree. It’s not worth it!” ”

“A troubled smile appeared on Xiao Xu’s face. “If she had listened to our words, then Miss Chen would not be like this.” ”

Doctor Liu Sighed. “Miss Chen is a rare infatuated child. It’s a pity that she didn’t meet the right person.”

“Little Xu didn’t respond. He continued, “Doctor Liu, I’ll leave this matter to you. Please make sure that third master knows about our eldest miss’s current situation.” ”

“”Don’t worry,”doctor Liu said. ”

“No matter what purpose Chen Siyao had for him to come here, this was still a human life. He couldn’t just ignore it. ”

“”Then I’ll leave it to you, doctor Liu,”little Xu said. ”

“”It’s nothing,”doctor Liu continued. “Please wait here.” ”

Little Xu nodded but didn’t leave immediately. He just stood there and watched doctor Liu leave. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“In a moment, doctor Liu’s car disappeared from sight. ”

Only then did little xu turn around and walk back.

Doctor Liu came all the way to Baiyun Residence.

“Seeing Doctor Liu’s car, Butler song immediately came out to greet him. “Doctor Liu.” ”
