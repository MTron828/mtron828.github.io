Chapter 145: 084: Bad Karma, Lin Ze came to cloud capital! 4

“Okay.”Ye Sen took the book with both hands.

After flipping through a few pages, ye Sen continued, “Niece, Guess What I saw downstairs just now?”

“What?”Ye Zhuo asked.

Ye Sen said, “I saw a top-class luxury car! The Silbe! And it’s a limited edition!”

“What’s so strange about that?”Ye Zao said faintly.

“Do you know how much the Silbe is for sale?” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“How much?”Ye Zao asked cooperatively.

“I’ll scare you to death if I tell you!”

After saying that, Ye Sen made a ‘ten’with both hands. “One billion!”

“OH.”Ye Zao said faintly.

“Oh?”Ye Sen looked at Ye Zao in surprise.

One billion in exchange for ye Zao’s faint ‘oh’?

Wasn’t she surprised?

This was one billion!

It was not ten yuan.

Ye Zao raised his eyelids and glanced at ye Sen. his tone was so calm, “I know, don’t worry! I’ll buy ten for you in the future!”

Ye Sen:”? ? ?”

He suspected that his niece was bragging, but he had no evidence.

Ye Sen continued, “There’s only one reason why such a luxurious car like the SILBE can appear in our shabby neighborhood!”

“Huh?”Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly.

Ye Sen looked as if he knew everything, “The guy in the car must be a domineering CEO or a big shot in the business world. His little wife lives in our neighborhood. Today, he had a conflict with her little wife...”

Ye Sen was completely immersed in his own plot.

“Wake up, uncle! There aren’t so many stories about domineering ceos and little wives in this world,”ye Zao heartlessly interrupted ye Sen’s imagination.

...

Night gradually fell, and the hazy night sky covered a luxurious sports car.

Under the lights of the street lamps, it could be seen that this was a limited edition silbet sports car.

There were no more than ten cars in the world!

The window was open.

From the outside, one could see the man’s well-defined side face. The dim light coated his face with a layer of gauze, and his already somewhat indistinct face was now even more faintly discernible.

He was wearing a plain-colored long robe with a string of dark red buddhist beads between his fingers.

His fingers were casually placed on the window as he gently stroked the Buddhist beads. The dark red Buddhist beads were particularly eye-catching when he used his fair fingers.

Music flowed in the carriage.

Through the window, one could faintly hear that this was a passage of the “Great Sorrow Mantra”.

After a long while, the man finally withdrew his hand and used the hand that was holding the Buddhist beads to pick up the lighter.

“Pa!”

Faint Blue Flames shot out from the man’s fingertips, illuminating the man’s exquisite side profile.

If this person wasn’t Cen Wuye, who else could it be?

He didn’t know what had happened to him either.

He had just returned to cloud capital today.

Almost as soon as he got off the plane, he drove the car here as if by some strange coincidence.

After parking the car, his restless heart suddenly stopped at this moment. The scene of him playing chess with Ye Zhuo suddenly appeared in his mind.

Her voice was still ringing in his ears.

She said,

“You’re too stupid!”

“It’s normal to lose to me. Don’t mind it.”

“Life is like chess, chess is like life. Never be deceived by false appearances. One wrong step, one wrong step. Mr. Cen, thank you for letting me win!”

Thinking of this, Cen Shaoqing slowly exhaled a puff of smoke. His eyes narrowed slightly, and the depths of his deep eyes were pitch black.

It was like a bottomless well.

This was ye Zao’s home.

The spot where he parked his car was right below the apartment building where ye Zao’s home was located.

Could it be... that he had fallen in love with ye Zao?

No!

This was impossible!

How could he fall in love with a little girl?

He only admired ye Zao.

He admired her chess skills.

He admired her technological talent.

He admired her knowledge...

He had never interacted with a woman in his life. He was not used to being so close to a little girl all of a sudden. He would have a strange feeling in his heart.

After a long time, he would get used to it.

It had nothing to do with romance.

It was also not about love.

Thinking of this, Cen Shaoqing heaved a sigh of relief. He extinguished the half-lit cigarette and threw away the cigarette butt.

PA —

It seemed like he threw it away casually, but the cigarette butt was thrown into the trash can ten meters away.

The car window was raised, and the man’s handsome and cold face was completely cut off inside the car window.

The man held the Buddhist beads in one hand and pressed the other hand on the steering wheel. He looked ahead and started the engine.

The black car left, leaving only dust on the ground.

When the dust fell, everything returned to normal.

Who would have noticed that not long ago, a luxury car had been parked here for nearly an hour?

...

The Ye family.

In the following days, as long as Ye Shu and Ye Sen were free, they would study English.
