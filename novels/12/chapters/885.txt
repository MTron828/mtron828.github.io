# song Yiwan reported YC’s Ye in her real name! #

[ I knew there was an inside story! ] 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“[ justice may be late, but it will never be absent! I hope that the perpetrator will be severely punished by the law! ] ”

[ such a disgusting person should be locked up for Life! ]

“[ if not for this photo, would the director of the program team have covered it up for her? ] ”

“[ my heart aches for her. It’s one thing to be forced to film with such a person, but now she’s being bullied to this extent! ] ”

“[ more importantly, that B * Tch doesn’t have any remorse at all! ] ”

[ how F * CKING disgusting! ]

Ye Zhuo scrolled through Weibo one by one. There was not the slightest expression on his handsome face.

“At first, there were only five or six trending searches. ”

“Now, she had actually taken over all the trending searches. ”

“Moreover, the names of the trending searches were constantly changing. ”

It could be seen that someone was controlling the comments behind the scenes and removing the trending searches.

Ye Zao narrowed her eyes.

“At this moment, a strong shadow came down from above her head. Then, her phone was taken away. A wine-red tassel swept across the back of her hand, and a low voice rang in her ears. ”

“Don’t look at your phone for a while. I’ll handle the rest.”

“Ye Zhuo raised his eyes slightly and saw an overly cold face. His thin lips were slightly pursed, and there was a layer of frost between his brows and eyes. ”

“Why are you here?”

“Cen Shaoqing’s face was dark. “Why didn’t you tell me that such a big thing happened?”Cen Shaoqing rarely paid attention to matters in the entertainment circle. If it weren’t for ye Zhuo’s participation in “Country”and the fact that he had been on the hot searches list many times.., he would have definitely missed this. ”

“After seeing these hot searches, Cen Shaoqing put down everything in his hands and flew to the east continent without even changing his slippers. ”

Ye Zhuo’s eyes were indifferent. “It’s a small matter. Don’t take it to heart. It’s better than not telling you.”

“”Ancestor.”Cen Shaoqing pinched his temples. “Now that the entire hot search page has exploded, how can it be a small matter?” ”

Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly. “So you’re the one who is controlling the comments and removing the trending page?”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“After learning about this matter, CEN Shaoqing immediately notified the public relations department and immediately removed the trending page to control the comments. ”

“However, this matter was too hot. ”

“With one trending page removed, dozens of trending pages appeared again. ”

Public opinion was the most difficult to control.

“Afraid that ye Zao would let his imagination run wild, Cen Shaoqing did not even change into his slippers and dared to come over without stopping. ”

“Unexpectedly, this person did not take this matter to heart at all. ”

“”There’s no need to remove the trending topic. The bigger this matter is, the better.” ”

Cen Shaoqing looked back at her and opened his thin lips slightly. “You have a video?”

“Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Now it’s up to how song Chenyu will respond. Currently, the netizens are very enthusiastic and the matter has reached a climax. Song Chenyu will definitely post a response on Weibo tonight.” ”

“Knowing that ye Zao had evidence, Cen Shaoqing heaved a sigh of relief and immediately contacted the public relations department. ”

“Song Chenyu had actually woken up a long time ago. Looking at Weibo being paralyzed time and time again, song Chenyu’s eyes were filled with pride. ”

Ye Zao wanted to fight with her?

He was still too inexperienced.

“With the situation that had developed to this point, Ye Zao was now an existence that everyone wanted to beat up. ”

He was not even a street rat.

“Song Chenyu asked his assistant to bring some makeup, put on a weak makeup, took a selfie, and edited the text to post on Weibo. ”

“Song Chenyu V: [ I’m sorry for making everyone worry for so long. I’m much better now. The Doctor said that I can be discharged from the hospital and go home soon. Thank you, Yvonne, for protecting song. ]. ”

“I really like what Yvonne said: Justice may be late, but it will never be absent. ”

“Actually, I don’t remember what happened that day very clearly. I only remember that I had a few words with leaf at that time, and then I fell into the ditch behind me. When I woke up again, I was already in the hospital. ”

“In addition, I’m very well now. Thank you for your concern. Although the Doctor said that the wound on my forehead might leave a scar, it’s okay. I can cover it with more concealer! Little Cuties, promise me that if you see this scar in front of the camera in the future, you’ll also have to pretend not to see it. [ photo JPG ] ”

“Once this Weibo post was posted, it was equivalent to confirming ye Zao’s crime. ”

“Although song Chenyu did not directly point out that ye Zao was the one who pushed her, between the lines, it was full of accusations against ye Zao. ”

Every word was bloody and every sentence was heart-wrenching.

“Seeing song Chenyu’s response, song Yiwan immediately responded to her on Weibo: [ Chenyu is so happy to see that you are fine. I look forward to your return. ] ”
