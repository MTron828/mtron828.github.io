“Chapter 1738: 358: tell me honestly, I’m from 200 years later, the jealous Fifth Master! 6”

Translator: 549690339

“Hearing this, Cen Shaoqing almost couldn’t catch his breath, but he still tried his best to calm his emotions and pretended not to care. He continued, “Then he definitely hasn’t done it as many times as I have!” ”

“For some unknown reason, when a man met a love rival, he always wanted to compete and determine the winner. ”

Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly. “That may not be the case.”

Cen Shaoqing was provoked. He once again covered her lips and took a bite.

“At first, he wanted to bite her hard, but in the end, he couldn’t bear to. ”

“His thin lips covered her lips. After a while, he slowly said, “Leader, don’t mention him in front of me in the future, Okay?” ”

“... I admit that I’m a little jealous.”His voice sounded a little aggrieved.

Ye Zao chuckled and looked at him. “Just a Little?”

“”A little more than a little.”The low voice sounded again, and it was a little hoarse. ”

“Ye Zao frowned slightly. She realized a detail. Every time they kissed, Cen Shaoqing’s voice would change a little. ”

He seemed to be restraining something.

“After a while, ye Zao continued, “Mr. Cen, are you a pig?” ”

Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted slightly. “It depends on whether you’re a sow or not.”

Ye Zao:”...”

Why didn’t she realize before that this person was so evil.

“”Leader, can you promise me?” ”

“What?”Ye Zao asked.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Don’t mention that person in front of me in the future. I’m afraid that I won’t be able to control myself.” ”

“For example, now. ”

“A man could not be stimulated, not to mention a man who had been pure of heart for so many years. ”

“At the moment, he only had one thought. ” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Immediately execute her on the spot!

“Do you know what his name is?”Ye Zhuo continued to ask.

Cen Shaoqing bit her. “I don’t want to know.”

“”No, you want to know.”Then, ye Zhuo whispered a name. ”

“Cen Shaoqing was stunned. Then, he said angrily, “That man actually has the same name as me!” ”

“In all aspects, his conditions were similar to his, so he tolerated it! ”

“However, Cen Shaoqing really could not tolerate the matter of having the same name. ”

Who could tolerate it but who could not tolerate it!

“Seeing his serious look, ye Zhuo laughed even louder. ”

“Sure enough, it was not unreasonable to say that no love could make people lower their intelligence. ”

“Fortunately, she had always maintained her consciousness! ”

“It was also at this time that Cen Shaoqing finally reacted. The Sour feeling in his heart instantly disappeared without a trace. “Leader, say it again! I didn’t hear it clearly just now.” ”

“Forget it if you didn’t hear it clearly.”Ye Zao pushed his hand away and walked forward.

“”Leader, you didn’t deceive me, right?”Cen Shaoqing immediately caught up with her steps. ”

“”I did,”ye Zhuo said. ”

“I know I didn’t trick you.”Cen Shaoqing held her hand tightly and suddenly felt very good. “There’s a dessert house ahead. Let’s go eat dessert.”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“The business of this dessert house was good. As soon as they entered, they could see many young couples. ”

Cello music was playing in the air. The environment was elegant and very suitable for dating and talking about cooperation.

The two of them picked a seat and sat down.

Ye Zhuo took the order tablet from the waiter and ordered his favorite desserts. He also ordered a cup of tea and a pastry for Cen Shaoqing. “That’s all. Thank you.”

“”Okay, I’ll check with you.” ”

“Okay.”

“After checking, the waiter took the tablet and walked inside. At this moment, CEN Shaoqing said slowly, “Wait a minute.” ”

“Do you need anything else?”The waiter turned around and asked.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “I will pay for all of your customers’expenses today.” ”

“The waiter was stunned. “Are... Are you sure?”Their dessert house was a high-end dessert house. A cup of tea was sold for around three digits. Most importantly, their customer flow was very good. If they really booked the entire place.., it was not a small amount. ”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“This was not a small matter. She could solve it by herself. She continued, “Then... Then I’ll get our manager to come over.” ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“After the waiter left, Ye Zhuo smiled at Cen Shaoqing. “Why do you suddenly want to pay for all the customers in this shop?” ”

“”I’m in a good mood,”Cen Shaoqing said lightly. ”

He was in a good mood and wanted to do something.

“Soon, the waiter came over with the manager. ”

“After the manager and Cen Shaoqing confirmed this matter, they announced the good news to the customers who arrived today. ”

“In a moment, ye Zao ordered something and it was served. ”

“Looking at the steaming white tea in front of him, cen Shaoqing continued, “I want another glass of iced lemon water.” ”

“”Okay, please wait a moment.” ”

“It was autumn now, and Cen Shaoqing actually wanted to drink iced lemonade. Ye Zao asked curiously, “Are You Hot?” ”

Cen Shaoqing coughed lightly. “I think I’m a little hot.”

“I also heard that your voice is a little off. Why don’t I Take Your Pulse?”

Take your pulse?

He could even take your pulse!

What if ye Zao found something?

“Thinking of this, Cen Shaoqing immediately retracted his hand. “It’s nothing. I’m just a little hot. I just need to drink some lemonade.” ”

“Just then, the waiter served ye Zao’s favorite dessert. Ye Zao had no time to care about anything else. He continued, “Alright then! If it really doesn’t work, you can look for me again.” ”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and opened his mouth to drink the ice-cold lemonade.

“The cold liquid entered his throat. Although it suppressed the heat in his body well, it was still a bit of a temporary solution. ”

He did not know when he would truly end his days of eating vegetarian and chanting Buddha!

...

On the other side.

At the Feng family’s villa.

Aunt Wu was overjoyed when she heard the news that Professor Feng had given his life for scientific research in C Nation.

“With professor Feng gone, no one would be able to threaten her in the future! ”

“As long as she coaxed this old fart in her family, she would be able to inherit the Feng family’s property smoothly. Thinking of this, the corners of Aunt Wu’s mouth were filled with a proud smile. ”

“If this person was lucky, even God would help him. ”

“”Mom, I heard that her daughter died!”Yang Ting ran in from outside, her eyes filled with excitement. ”

“”Yes, it was reported on the news. How could it be fake?”Auntie Wu asked back. ”

“Yang ting smiled and said, “Then we won’t have any worries anymore!” ”

“”Who says so?”Auntie wu sighed and continued, “Tingting, in the future, we must treat that old lady twice as well! We must not let her property be taken away by others!” ”

“”Don’t worry, Mom!”Yang Ting nodded. ”

In the bedroom on the third floor.

“The old lady sat on the head of the bed, feeling uneasy. ”

It was as if something big had happened.

“It was said that mother and daughter were connected. Although the old lady had not received the news or seen the news, she could feel that something was wrong. Her heart was in a panic and it hurt a little. ”

It was as if her flesh and blood were separated.

“In a moment, the old lady stood up from the bed and walked to the French window. She stopped and looked into the distance. ”

“At this moment, there was a knock on the door. “Old Lady, are you inside? Someone is looking for you outside.” ”
