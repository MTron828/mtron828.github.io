“Chapter 665: 152: the truth has been dug out layer by layer. The secret of the health-preserving soup, Old Lady Lin was filled with regret! 3”

“If all these were true, there would definitely be rumors spread, but she had never heard any rumors at all. ”

What Mrs Zhang was Feng Qianhua’s biological mother.

It was simply nonsense!

“”Qianhua! I believe you.”After saying that, Old Lady Lin looked at Ye Zhuo again. “Shut up! Do you really think that I will believe your one-sided words?” ”

“Hearing that, Feng Qianhua heaved a sigh of relief. ”

As long as Old Lady Lin believed her.

So what if ye Zao knew everything?

Did Ye Zao have any evidence to prove all of this?

“Although Xu Lanyue was standing right here, Feng Qianhua did not believe that her biological aunt would betray her. ”

“After all, she had treated Xu Lanyue quite well all these years. ”

“At this moment, Xu Lanyue, who had not spoken all this while, took a step forward, “Old Madam, my name is Xu Lanyue. I’m sister-in-law Xu Lanyue, and I’m also Feng Qianhua’s aunt. “Back then, I was the one who used my authority to issue my sister’s death certificate to her. “I can testify for Miss Ye. Everything Miss Ye said is true! “Because I’ve participated in all of these things before, I’m willing to pay the price for everything I’ve Done!” ”

Things had already come to this.

“Although she had let down her sister and niece, she only wanted to protect her son. ”

“She was already over sixty years old, and it was fine for her to go to jail. ”

But her son was still young.

She could not drag her son into jail.

“Feng Qianhua did not expect Xu Lanyue to suddenly switch sides, and her eyes widened. “You’re talking nonsense! I don’t have an aunt at all! My mother is old Madam Feng! Who Do you think you are!” ”

“Aunt Zhang added, “There are no sentient beings! You’re simply making things out of nothing! Old Madam, please don’t believe these people’s Nonsense!”After saying that, Aunt Zhang turned to look at Ye Zhuo. ”

“”Eldest miss, I know that you’ve always been very jealous of Miss Qianhua and her daughter! I hate that old madam likes Xianxian and doesn’t like you, her biological granddaughter! But you can’t make up such unrealistic words to frame them just because you’re jealous of them! “You should find the problem from your own perspective. Why does the Old Lady Prefer Xianxian to you? !” ”

“In just a few sentences, aunt Zhang threw all the blame on ye Zao. ”

How Old was ye Zao?

Nineteen years old!

A nineteen-year-old little girl still wanted to fight with her!

It was simply a fantasy!

“She had been by Old Lady Lin’s side for so long, and no one knew her better than she did. ”

Old Lady Lin would never believe ye Zao just because of a few words from ye Zao.

“Not only would she not believe her, but she would also make Old Lady Lin hate her even more. ”

What ye Zao did was no different from shooting himself in the foot.

Ye Zao took out a paternity test from his bag unhurriedly. “Then how do you explain this paternity test? It clearly states that Feng Qianhua is your biological daughter!”

Paternity Test?

Ye Zao actually did a paternity test!

When did she do it?

Aunt Zhang’s expression immediately changed.

“Bring it over for me to take a look!”Old Mrs. Lin frowned.

Ye Zao handed the paternity test to Old Mrs. Lin. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Old Mrs. Lin’s hands trembled as she received the paternity test that ye Zao handed over.

Yes.

That’s right.

“On the paternity test report, it clearly stated that Feng Qianhua and aunt Zhang were biological mother and daughter. ”

How could this be?

Old Mrs. Lin frowned tightly.

Could it be that things were really as ye Zao Said?

“The car accident in Lin Jin city, including the subsequent events, were all done by Feng Qianhua herself? ”

“”Fake! Your paternity test is fake!”Feng Qianhua stared at ye Zao tightly, “Technology is so advanced nowadays, I can have as many paternity test results like this as I want! Old Mrs. Lin, you must not be deceived by her! This paternity test result is fake!” ”

Feng Qianhua was really a little flustered.

She thought that she could fool old madam Lin about this matter.

“Ye Zhuoqian curled her lips slightly. “If you doubt that this paternity test is fake, we can go to the hospital now to redo the test. Under the emergency situation, the report can be issued in three hours. Do you dare to go?” ”

“”I’m not going! Why should I go?”Feng Qianhua looked at Old Madam Lin, “Aunt Lin, don’t believe her! I didn’t do these things, I really didn’t! Aunt Zhang has nothing to do with me! She’s not my biological mother! My biological mother is old Madam Feng!” ”

“”It’s not that you’re not going, you’re just too guilty to go.”Ye Zhuo continued, “Because you and aunt Zhang are biological mother and daughter!” ”

“Aunt Lin! Believe me!”
