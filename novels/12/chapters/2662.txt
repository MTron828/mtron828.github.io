Ye Zao: ...

“Ye Shu continued, “Come Shaoqing, come and hold the baby.” ” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Me?”Cen Shaoqing was stunned.

“”Yes.”Ye Shu nodded. “You should get used to it first. Otherwise, when you have a child with Zao Zao, you won’t be able to hold it.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing hesitated. It was not that he did not dare to hold the baby, but he was a little afraid. ”

The newborn baby was so small.

“His hands were small, his feet were small, and his face was small. What if he accidentally broke his hands and feet? ”

“Cen Shaoqing had never held such a small child before, so he was really a little flustered. ”

“Ye Shu handed the child to Cen Shaoqing, “Shaoqing, try it. Don’t be nervous. First, put your left hand here, and then put your right hand here. Yes, yes, yes, that’s it. See, isn’t this good? Everything is difficult at the beginning.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing was holding the child in his arms. He felt that it weighed more than ten million pounds. It was small and soft. No matter how he held it, he felt that something was wrong. He was afraid that he would strangle the child, but he was also afraid that he would drop the child if he held it too loosely. ”

“”How is it?”Ye Shu continued to ask, “Do You Feel Better Now?” ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Much better.”

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “The child just needs to be hugged more. It will be much better if you hug him more.” ”

“Okay.”

“At this moment, CEN Shaoqing’s expression changed. ”

“Ye Shu noticed the change in his expression and immediately asked, “What’s Wrong?” ”

“CEN Shaoqing said, “He, he, he seems to have peed.” ”

“Peed?”Ye Shu asked.

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

Ye Shu immediately took the child. “Let me take a look.”

“Just as she reached out to carry the child, ye Shu touched the hot liquid and said with a smile, “Sure enough, he peed. This little bastard, why did he pee on Uncle?” ”

“After saying that, Ye Shu looked at Lin Jincheng. “Go and get the baby’s diaper.” ”

“Okay.”Lin Jincheng nodded and immediately went to get the diaper.

“The husband and wife were busy changing the baby’s diaper. Cen Shaoqing bent slightly and looked at him very seriously, like a primary school student listening to a lecture. ”

This scene amused ye Zhuo. “Why are you looking at him when he’s changing his diaper? Do you want to wear one too?”

“CEN Shaoqing said, “I’m learning.” ”

“Learning what?”Ye Zhuo asked.

What was so good about changing a diaper?

Cen Shaoqing didn’t say anything. He continued to watch Lin Jincheng and ye Shu change the child’s diaper.

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “Look at this little guy being lazy. He can even fall asleep while changing a diaper.” ”

“As soon as he said that, the little guy who was sleeping soundly started crying loudly, as if he was refuting ye Shu’s words. ”

“”This is too magical!”Ye Shu looked at Lin Jincheng. “Jincheng, did you hear that?” ”

“Lin Jincheng also felt that it was very magical. “I heard it, I heard it.” ”

“This was the first time that the two of them were grandparents. No matter how the child reacted, they felt that it was very novel. ”

“At this moment, Cen Shaoqing walked to ye Zao’s side. “Leader.” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao raised his eyes slightly.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “I’ve learned it.” ”

“Learned what?”Ye Zao felt that it was somewhat baffling.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “I’ve learned how to change diapers.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing lowered his voice and whispered into ye Zao’s ear. He slowly said, “From now on, I’ll be the contractor for our daughter’s diapers.” ”

“What if it’s a son?”Ye Zao asked.

“”Then there’s still a sister-in-law,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“”How Can You Be Like This!”Ye Zao said, “What era are we in? Why are you still sexist?” ”

“CEN Shaoqing said, “Because a daughter needs to be well-off and a son needs to be poor. I don’t want the Little Princess that I’ve worked so hard to raise to be coaxed away by a dog man after she grows up.” ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “What you said does make sense.”

“At that moment, Bai Jingshu was pushed out of the delivery room. ”

“Ye Shu and Lin Jincheng immediately carried the child forward. “Jingshu, how are you now?” ”

“”I’m very well. Parents, you don’t have to worry.”Bai Jingshu did seem to be in a good condition. ”

“Where’s the child?”Bai Jingshu asked immediately.

“”Here, here.”Ye Shu immediately placed the baby next to Bai Jingshu. ”

Bai Jingshu turned her head and frowned slightly. “It’s so dark! Did I carry the wrong baby?”It was completely different from the white and tender baby that she had imagined.

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “It’s not dark, it’s red. All newborn babies are like this. They’ll be fine in a few days.” ”

“Really?”Bai Jingshu asked.

“Of course it’s true.”Ye Shu nodded.

Bai Jingshu reached out and carefully poked the child’s forehead. “But he’s really ugly.”

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “He’ll look good if he’s raised.” ”

Bai Jingshu smiled and nodded.

“When they returned to the ward, ye Shu said, “I’ll call the housekeeper to send over some chicken soup.” ”

“Upon hearing this, Cen Shaoqing said, “There’s no need, Aunty. My grandmother and my mother are on their way here right now. They brought chicken soup.” ”

“As soon as he said this, there was a knock on the door. ”

Ye Zhuo walked over to open the door.

“Aunt Xiang! Grandmother Cen.”

“That’s right, the people outside were Zhou Xiang and Old Lady Cen. ”
