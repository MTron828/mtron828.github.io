“”Welcome, Miss Ye!””

“No one knew who said this at the meeting table, but everyone started clapping.”

“”Thank you, everyone.”Ye Zhuo bent down slightly.”

“Cen Hai raised his hand and said, “Miss Ye, are you officially joining our base?””

“Sort of.”Ye Zhuo’s tone was clear and shallow.

“Hearing the affirmative answer, Tang Xue’s heart tightened.”

It was so uncomfortable that she couldn’t breathe.

“Ye Zhuo hadn’t even joined the base, yet these people were already talking about ye Zhuo.”

“If ye Zhuo joined the base, would the base still have her say in the future?”

Tang Xue’s heart was very uncomfortable. She didn’t even hear what Cen Shaoqing was saying on the stage.

She only vaguely heard two words.

Space Mothership.

“When she heard this word, Tang Xue looked up at Cen Shaoqing. Her eyes were filled with disbelief.”

Developing a space mothership?

And it was successfully developed within two years!

Wasn’t this a fantasy?

Could this be the legendary love brain?

Cen Shaoqing actually believed that ye Zao could develop a space mothership!

How could ye Zao not say that she could fly into the sky?

Tang Xue was not the only one who thought so. The others were also stunned. They felt that Cen Shaoqing was dreaming.

“”Master five, the aircraft carrier is not just for show. Let’s not talk about the labor and cost. Do you think that we have the technology now?””

“”Master five, I also think that your decision is inappropriate.”Even director Zhao, who had always supported Cen Shaoqing and ye Zao, felt that this idea was too bold.”

“”This kind of thing is not child’s play. Once we decide to implement the plan, there will be thousands of pairs of eyes staring at us. If we can’t develop it within two years, wouldn’t it be a disgrace?””

“”Professor Yue is right. The development of an aircraft carrier needs to be reported. If the development fails at the deadline, who will bear the consequences?””

“”Think again, master five!””

Cen Shaoqing leaned slightly and rested his hands on the conference table as he looked at everyone.

“It was originally a very casual action, but it exploded with a powerful aura. The originally noisy conference table instantly quieted down.”

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “This matter has been decided. Those who are willing to form a scientific research group with Miss Ye, stand on Miss Ye’s side.””

There was a few seconds of silence in the air.

Everyone looked at each other. Not a single one of them was willing to follow ye Zao.

Huala —

“At this moment, Cen Hai stood up. “Miss Ye, can I join your research group?””

“It’s my honor.”

Cen Hai walked to Ye Zao’s side.

Tang Xue glanced at Cen Hai with a mocking expression on her face.

Cen Hai was an idiot.

Just wait.

“Sooner or later, he would cry.”

Huala —

“Cen Hu, Cen Jiang, and Cen he also stood up.”

“”Miss Ye, we also want to join your research group.””

“It’s my honor.”

“After the four brothers of Jianghe Hu Hai all stood beside ye Zao, the people at the conference table looked at the four of them as if they were looking at four madmen.”

Who would believe that someone could develop an aircraft carrier in two years?

Wasn’t this a joke about their own future?

“”Miss... Miss Ye, i... I’ll Join Your Research Group?”A short-haired girl wearing glasses stood up from her chair.”

“This girl was called Tang Mi. Because she stuttered when she was nervous, she had a nickname called Little Stutterer.”

“You’re very welcome.”

“Thank you.”Tang mi bowed slightly and walked to ye Zhuo’s side.

“Little Stutterer.”Cen Jiang Winked at Tang Mi.

“After Tang Mi, no one else stood up.”

“CEN Shaoqing said, “Is there anyone else who is willing to join Miss Ye’s research group?””

The meeting table was completely silent.

They weren’t fools.

They would never join such an unrestrained group.

“Seeing that no one was talking, CEN Shaoqing continued, “Alright, today’s meeting is over. Meeting adjourned.””

The others walked out of the meeting room one after another.

Ye Zhuo and her research group members stayed in the meeting room.

“Just as they walked out of the meeting room, the sound of discussion spread. “Do you think Master Five has gone crazy?””

“”Professor Yue, director Zhao, director Wang, you are all old people of the base, you must persuade Master Five! Although heroes can not overcome the beauty barrier, master five can not joke about the future of the base!””

“Yes!”

“Professor Yue, director Zhao, and director Wang’s expressions were a little ugly.”

None of them expected that Cen Shaoqing would turn out like this.

“For a woman, he didn’t even distinguish right from wrong!”

“Although ye Zhuo’s ability was undeniable, it was an aircraft carrier!”
