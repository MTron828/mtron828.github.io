“Chapter 408: 118: The Great Burning Trap reveals Mu Yourong’s true colors, and Li Qiandong breaks down! 4”

Translator: 549690339

It was said that men do not fight with women.

But he could not hold it in any longer.

Ye Zao was really too much!

“Even if Mu Yourong could hold it in, he could not! ”

“Today, he had to teach ye Zao a lesson on behalf of Mu Yourong. ”

“Otherwise, she would really think that there was no one backing mu yourong. ”

Ye Zao did not Dodge.

“He just stood there, extremely calm, and gently lifted his foot. ”

Bang!

Li Qiandong fell to the ground just like that.

It was so painful that his facial features were all twisted together.

“Big Brother Li.”

Mu Yourong was scared to death and hurriedly ran over to pull Li Qiandong up.

Layers of cold sweat appeared on Li Qiandong’s forehead.

It was extremely painful.

It hurt.

It really hurt too much!

“Mu Yourong raised her head to look at ye Zao and angrily said, “Ye Zao! How could you treat big brother Li Like This!” ”

“Ye Zao pointed at the ceiling. “He was the one who made the first move. I was acting in self-defense, and I have the surveillance cameras as proof. Why, do you want to call the police? If you want to call the police, I’ll wait for the police to come.” ”

“You!”Mu Yourong was furious.

“Ye Zhuo raised his hand and tidied up the loose hair by his ear. “If you don’t dare to call the police, then I’ll take my leave first.” ”

“With that, she turned and walked out of the door. ”

“Looking at ye Zhuo’s back, Li Qiandong only wanted to give himself a vicious slap. If it weren’t for his incompetence, he wouldn’t have let ye Zhuo be so arrogant! ”

“Mu Yourong helped Li Qiandong to a chair at the side and sat him down. “Big Brother Li, are you alright?” ”

He couldn’t even defeat a woman.

He had even lost face in front of the woman he loved. This made Li Qiandong feel extremely ashamed.

It was all his fault for not being outstanding enough!

He couldn’t even protect the woman he loved.

“”Yourong, I’m sorry. It’s all my fault for being useless...” ”

“”Big Brother Li,”Mu Yourong immediately covered Li Qiandong’s mouth. “You don’t have to say sorry. You’ve already helped me a lot.” ”

“Li Qiandong sighed. “Yourong, you’re a good girl. Unfortunately, fifth brother has too deep a misunderstanding of you. Even when aunt passed away, they...” ”

Mu Yourong bit her lip. “You told them about my mother?”

“Yes.”Li Qiandong nodded.

“Mu yourong said, “Didn’t I tell you not to tell them about this?”Actually, Mu Yourong’s original intention was to pass this matter on to the Cen family through Li Qiandong. ”

But who knew that the Cen family would actually be indifferent!

“Mu Yourong subconsciously touched her belly and cried, “It’s normal that they didn’t come. After all, my parents treated grandmother and Aunt Xiang so well when they were alive. If it were me, I wouldn’t be able to forgive my parents...” ”

“Li Qiandong said, “But aunt has already left! The dead are the most important! Moreover, those matters have nothing to do with you!” ” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Mu Yourong’s face was full of tears as she continued, “Big Brother Li, can you help me with something?” ”

“What is it?”Li Qiandong asked.

Mu Yourong hesitated for a moment. “I want you to use your name to ask fifth master out. I have something to say to fifth master.”

Li Qiandong nodded. “Sure!”

“”Thank you, Big Brother Li!” ”

“After leaving the funeral home, Li Qiandong called Cen Shaoqing and asked him to meet him at a hotel. ”

Cen Shaoqing agreed without even asking for the reason.

“After making an appointment with Cen Shaoqing, Li Qiandong called mu yourong. ”

Mu Yourong was very excited after hearing this.

She finally had a chance to be alone with Cen Shaoqing!

“Mu Yourong specially put on teardrop makeup and wore a white dress, looking very charming. ”

“After she was ready, Mu Yourong took out a bottle of transparent medicine from the drawer and put it in her bag before walking out. ”

This medicine had a hallucinogenic effect.

“Regardless of whether it was a man or a woman, a single drop would cause them to fall. ”

“Unless they had taken the antidote beforehand, they would lose consciousness even if they smelled it. ”

It was the same medicine that Mu Yourong had gotten from the system when the system was still around.

It was a pity that she had kept such a trick up her sleeve.

“Otherwise, where would she get such a medicine now? ”

Mu Yourong felt goosebumps all over her body as she walked from her room to the living room.

She had to seize this opportunity.

She had to take down Cen Shaoqing!

“At that time, she would take the position of the Cen family’s young madam. ”

“As a person who had been reborn, Mu Yourong believed in supernatural events. She was truly a little afraid that Shen Rong had died in this room. ”

“But on the other hand, Shen Rong had been poisoned because she had forgotten to turn off the gas stove! ”

What did this have to do with her?

“Even if she was a ghost, Shen Rong could only be a wronged ghost. ”

“With this in mind, Mu Yourong was no longer afraid and continued to walk out. ”

“When she arrived at the hotel, Cen Shaoqing had not arrived yet. ”

Mu Yourong went to the bathroom to tidy up her appearance and put the medicine in her pocket. She was ready to break the bottle at any time and make Cen Shaoqing lose consciousness.
