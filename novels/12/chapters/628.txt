“”Silly child, we’re all family. What’s there to thank!” ”

“Zhou Xiang came over and said, “Zhuozhuo, you haven’t come over to play for a long time! If you’re free this Saturday, you must come over to play with Shaoqing!” ”

“Alright.”

The three of them chatted for quite a while before hanging up the video call.

“Just as ye Zhuo hung up the phone, the doctor came over with the report. “Miss Ye, the test results you requested are out.” ”

Ye Zhuo took the report with both hands. “Thank you.”

“You’re welcome.”

Ye Zhuo looked at the report with a glance and the corners of his mouth curled up slightly.

It seemed that her guess was right.

Aunt Zhang and Feng Qianhua were biological mother and daughter.

Ye Zhuo put the test report into his bag and turned around to walk downstairs.

“Just as he walked out of the hospital door, he saw an acquaintance. ”

“Zao Zao!”

“Aunt Xia!”Ye Zao turned around and saw Xia Xiaoman.

“Xia Xiaoman smiled and said, “Zao Zao, I didn’t expect it to really be you! Are you not feeling well at the hospital?” ”

“Ye Zao said, “I’m here to get a report. What About You, Aunt?” ”

“Xia Xiaoman continued, “I’ve been catching a cold recently, so I came to the hospital to take a look.” ”

“OH.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

The two of them chatted as they walked.

“At this moment, a low-profile mercedes-benz stopped by the roadside. “Zao Zao!” ”

“The car window rolled down, revealing a cool and handsome face. ”

“Fourth uncle!”

Lin Qingxuan nodded and opened the car door to get out. Her gaze fell on Xia Xiaoman who was beside ye Zao. “This is?”

“Ye Zhuo took the initiative to introduce her. “This is my classmate’s mother, Auntie Xia. Auntie Xia, this is my fourth uncle.” ”

“Lin Qingxuan extended her hand towards Xia Xiaoman. “Hello, Madam Xia.” ”

“Mr. Lin.”Xia Xiaoman shook hands with Lin Qingxuan.

“Lin Qingxuan continued, “May I ask if we’ve met before? I don’t mean anything by it. I just feel that Madam Xia looks a little familiar!” ”

“Xia Xiaoman also felt that Lin Qingxuan looked a little familiar. Something seemed to suddenly appear in front of her eyes. “We should have met at the hospital before, right? Did I accidentally bump into You?” ”

“It had been a while since she last met Lin Qingxuan. At that time, Xia Xiaoman apologized to Lin Qingxuan, but Lin Qingxuan did not react at all. He left without saying a word. ”

She thought that Lin Qingxuan was a mute.

“Lin Qingxuan also remembered what had happened at the hospital that day. “Yes, yes, yes! It was that day!”That was the most important day of his life, it was also the day of his rebirth. If he hadn’t gone to the hospital that day, he would still be living under Zhao Shuning’s deception. ”

“Ye Zhuo said in surprise, “Fourth uncle, do you know Aunt Xia?” ”

“Lin qingxuan smiled and said, “We met once before.” ”

Xia Xiaoman nodded as well. “Yes.”

“Xia Xiaoman then continued, “Zao Zao, if you have time, come visit Auntie. Auntie has something to do today, so I’ll be leaving First!” ”

“”Alright, you can go ahead.” ”

Lin Qingxuan looked at Ye Zao. “Where are you going? I’ll send you.”

“Then I’ll have to trouble fourth uncle to send me home.”Ye Zao opened the door of the passenger seat.

“Okay.”Lin Qingxuan nodded.

“After getting into the car, Lin Qingxuan asked curiously, “Zhuozhuo, does your classmate’s family also live in the capital?” ”

“Ye Zhuo said, “Her family is in Yun capital, but she has moved to the Capital Now! Oh right, fourth uncle, aunt Xia is also single.” ”

The last sentence was very suggestive.

“Lin qingxuan smiled and said, “This child!” ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “I heard that grandmother has been looking for a fourth aunt for you recently?” ”

“”I don’t have any plans in this area right now. Your grandmother only knows how to mess around!”Because of Zhao shuning, Lin Qingxuan had been staying abroad for more than ten years. Now, he only wanted to live quietly in his hometown for a period of time. ”

“After everything was settled, he would return abroad to consider other matters. ”

The Lin family.

“Even when she returned home, Old Lady Lin was still furious. ”

She had thought that she would be able to settle the matter between Feng Xianxian and Cen Shaoqing by going to the CEN family home today. She had not expected that old lady cen would be so unappreciative! Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

She actually looked down on Feng Xianxian.

She was really capable!

“Other than being stupid, Old Lady Lin did not have any other words to describe old lady cen. ”

“Seeing Old Lady Lin Return, Aunt Zhang quickly came up to her. “Old Lady, how was the discussion at the Cen Residence?” ”

“According to Old Lady Lin and Old Lady Cen’s friendship, the two of them must have had a very pleasant exchange. ”

Old Lady Lin was ye Zhuo’s biological granddaughter.

“Even her biological grandmother did not like ye Zhuo, how could old lady Cen Like Him? ”

A discerning person should know to choose Feng Xianxian.

Old Madam Lin’s eyes were filled with anger. “I think Bai Tang is becoming more and more stupid as she grows older! Her old eyes are blurred! She’s delaying the future generations!”

“Aunt Zhang narrowed her eyes, and an ominous premonition arose spontaneously. “Old Madam, what’s Going On?” ”

“Old Madam Lin did not directly answer aunt Zhang’s question. She continued, “Go and bring me the business card of the female Durban Representative!” ”

“Alright.”Zhang Sao nodded and ran to get the business card.

“Soon, Zhang Sao came over with the business card. “Here you are, Old Mrs. Lin.” ”

“Old Mrs. Lin took the business card, picked up her phone, and made a call. ”

“After the call, old Mrs. Lin continued, “In a while, the woman in charge of Durban will come. Zhang Sao, arrange for someone to go to the door to receive her.” ”

The security of the Lin Manor was very good. Not just anyone could enter.

“Okay.”

Aunt Zhang nodded.

“Half an hour later, Aunt Zhang brought in a middle-aged man with a mustache and a strong build. “Old Lady, this is the person in charge of our daughter Durban, Mr. Zhao.” ”

“”Hello, Mr. Zhao.”Old Mrs. Lin greeted him with a smile. ”

“Old Lady Lin.”

“Old Lady Lin then arranged for the servants to make tea for Mr Zhang and then gave him a big red packet, “Mr Zhang, my granddaughter has just returned from the countryside. She has no respect for her elders, is rebellious, and has no manners at all. I wonder if you have any way to get her to correct her bad conduct?” ”

“Mr. Zhang smiled and said, “Don’t worry, Old Lady. No matter how bad a child is, as long as they are in my hands, they will be taught to be obedient, sensible, and reasonable!” ”
