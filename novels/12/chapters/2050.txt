“Chapter 2051: 427: Nirvana of the Phoenix, return of the fire of Desire! 1”

Ye Zhuo.

These two words were very clear and cold.

“The voice was not loud, but it was loud and clear. ”

“Hearing this, everyone looked towards the source of the sound. ”

They saw a slender figure slowly walking towards them.

Against the light.

“She wore a black cap on her head, and it was hard to see her face clearly. As she walked, a powerful aura erupted from her body, causing people to not dare to look directly at her. ”

“The six clan leaders looked at the person who came, and cold sweat broke out on their foreheads. They took a few steps back in disbelief. ”

“Who, who was that? ”

Ye Zao?

No!

It couldn’t be!

Ye Zao was already dead.

That wasn’t Ye Zao.

It definitely wasn’t Ye Zao.

“The six clan leaders tried their best to calm themselves down. Although they tried to persuade themselves to calm down, the cold sweat on their foreheads couldn’t be stopped, and their hands and feet were trembling. ”

Qiu di frowned slightly.

“Ye Zao’s body had been frozen in the liquid nitrogen room for several months. Not only had he disappeared a few days ago, how could the dead be revived in this world? ”

It was simply absurd.

Qiu Di narrowed his eyes. It was obvious that this was Li Zi Yue’s trick.

So he had found an imposter who looked like ye Zao to scare her.

“If she wanted to find someone who looked like her, she should find someone who didn’t even dare to show her face. What was going on? ”

It was one thing to lie to clan leader six with such a small trick.

She wanted to lie to her?

It was impossible!

Did she really think that she was made of paper?

Qiu Di curled her lips.

“She was an idiot, and she thought that she was an idiot? ”

She was extremely stupid.

“Qiu Di turned to clan leader six and comforted him in a low voice, “Don’t panic, Ye Zhuo is already dead.” ”

“That... that...”the sixth clan leader stammered.

“That’s a fake.”Qiu Di said.

“”But, but...”the sixth clan leader looked at the person who came, “But she looks too similar! Could it be that ye Zhuo really came back?” ”

“The more he spoke, the more anxious the sixth clan leader became. His voice couldn’t help but tremble. ”

“She doesn’t even dare to show her face. What are you afraid of?”Qiu Di said.

“If she really was ye Zhuo, would she not even dare to show her face? ”

It was very obvious.

The person who came was not ye Zhuo at all.

He did not know what the sixth chief was panicking about!

He had lived for so many years in vain.

He did not even have a single opinion when he encountered matters.

“Hearing Autumn Flute’s analysis, the sixth chief calmed down a little. ”

Right.

That was a fake who did not dare to show her face.

There was nothing to be afraid of at all.

The six clan leaders took a deep breath.

Seeing this.

The people below the stage were all stunned.

They looked at the figure walking up the stage. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

His gaze was fervent.

“Miss Ye!”

“It’s Miss Ye Who’s Back!”

“The eyes of the first clan leader instantly turned red. Looking at the person who had come, he was unable to speak for a long time. The faith that had disappeared from his heart instantly returned. ”

The other six clan leaders were also very excited.

He was back!

Ye Zhuo had finally returned.

“Other than being excited, the second patriarch was also a little puzzled. They had clearly seen ye Zhuo’s remains... ”

“At this moment, why would ye Zhuo appear here again? ”

“The second patriarch looked at the first patriarch and continued, “Big Brother, do you think this is Miss Ye?” ”

The first patriarch was stunned. “What do you mean?”

“”Others may not know, but don’t we brothers know?”The second patriarch continued, “Miss Ye has already left for several months. How, how could...” ”

The rest of the words were already self-evident.

It was also at this time that the first patriarch recalled what happened a few months ago.

Indeed.

“At that time, they had already seen ye Zhuo’s remains. ”

“The second patriarch continued, “I also hope that Miss Ye can return, but this matter is really too inconceivable.” ”

“”I dare to confirm that it’s Miss Ye!”The fifth patriarch spoke at this time. “Even though I can’t explain what exactly happened, i absolutely won’t mistake Miss Ye!” ”

“The seventh patriarch said, “I support fifth! That’s Miss Ye!” ”

“”But Miss Ye has already left!”The second patriarch continued, “What if someone with ulterior motives is impersonating Miss Ye?” ”

He also wanted ye Zhuo to come back to life.

But the facts were the facts.

It couldn’t be said that ye Zhuo had come back from the dead!

“If someone was impersonating ye Zhuo, the consequences would be unimaginable! ”

“”It can’t be! We must have made a mistake! Miss Ye isn’t dead at all!”The seventh patriarch continued, “That’s Miss Ye!” ”

“The fifth patriarch said, “Old Qi is right! Miss Ye isn’t dead at all!” ”

“The second patriarch sighed, “Fifth, seventh, I can understand your feelings. I’m the same as you. I also hope that Miss Ye isn’t dead and that Miss Ye can continue to be our leader, but...”the following words.., the second patriarch couldn’t say it no matter what. ”
