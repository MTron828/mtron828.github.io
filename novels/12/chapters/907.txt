“”Fourth aunt, What’s Wrong?”Tian Tian tugged at the corner of Cen Yuyan’s clothes.”

“Cen Yuyan finally reacted. She lowered her head to look at Tian Tian and suppressed the anger in her heart. “Tian Tian, fourth aunt is fine. Don’t speak for now.””

“OH.”Tian Tian nodded.

The conversation next door continued.

Cen Yuyan took a deep breath and took a step forward to look at the opposite side.

There was a hibiscus flower in the small garden.

“From Cen Yuyan’s angle, she could see the two of them standing face to face. Behind them was a blooming hibiscus flower. Although the night was dark, under the illumination of the street lamps.., cen Yuyan could clearly see the expressions on their faces.”

“”Lu Xiu, I’ve already told you. Liking doesn’t necessarily mean possessing. You can turn this liking into a blessing and protection! Don’t you want to see me obtain happiness?””

“”So, I can’t be the person who gives you happiness, right?”Lu Xiu asked.”

Give her happiness?

A mocking expression flashed across song Chenyu’s lowered eyes.

Lu Xiu didn’t even take a piss to reflect on himself.

How could he be worthy of her?

“If Lu Xiu wasn’t still useful to her, she wouldn’t even bother to deal with him.”

“Song Chenyu narrowed her eyes and looked up at Lu Xiu. “Lu Xiu, do you have to do this? Isn’t our current situation pretty good?””

“Looking at song Chenyu in front of him, Lu Xiu felt a little unfamiliar.”

Was the person in front of him still the little girl from back then?

“Lu Xiu exhaled and lowered his voice. “Chenyu, are you using me as a spare tire?””

“Although Lu Xiu really didn’t want to say this,.”

He felt that ye Zhuo was right.

“Liking meant liking, and disliking meant disliking.”

“If song Chenyu kept being so ambiguous, then she was using him as a spare tire.”

No man would be willing to be a spare tire for the woman he liked.

“Lu Xiu was almost 30 years old. He was an only child at home, so he didn’t have many years left.”

“Right now, he only wanted an answer from song Chenyu.”

“Song Chenyu panicked. “Lu Xiu, why do you think this way?””

“Lu Xiu continued, “Chenyu, you’ve always known my intentions. In the past, you couldn’t agree to it because of Cen Yuyan’s concerns. I understand you, but now, Cen Yuyan has already found her own happiness. I don’t understand what other concerns you have! “I don’t want to force you. I only want an answer from you. If you like it, then you like it. If you don’t like it, then you don’t like it. Is this so difficult for you?””

Song Chenyu didn’t know why Lu Xiu had become like this.

“To song Chenyu, Lu Xiu was the marionette in her hand. It was something in her hand that she could give up everything for.”

“But now, this marionette suddenly had its own thoughts. Song Chenyu couldn’t accept it at all!”

When she heard this.

Cen Yuyan’s already pale face turned pale at this moment.

She had always known.

“In other words, song Chenyu had always known that the person Lu Xiu liked was her. Song Chenyu clearly knew that the person Lu Xiu liked was her, but he still pretended to give her advice and even made her confess to Lu Xiu.”

“She was like a fool, being played around by Song Chenyu.”

“The more Cen Yuyan thought about it, the angrier she got. A sense of humiliation that she had never felt before surged into her heart. She bit her lips tightly, and her entire body was trembling.” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“At this moment, CEN Yuyan could no longer control the monstrous emotions in her body. She rushed over and directly gave song Chenyu a slap before song Chenyu could react!”

Pa..

This slap made song Chenyu dumbfounded.

“Lu Xiu reacted immediately and pulled song Chenyu behind him. He glared at Cen Yuyan. “Cen Yuyan, what are you doing? !””

“”Lu Xiu, this is between me and song Chenyu. Get Out of my way!””

It was also at this moment that song Chenyu reacted. Her heart was filled with panic.

She did not expect Cen Yuyan to hear everything.

How much did Cen Yuyan Hear?

“Song Chenyu tried his best to calm himself down. He walked out from behind Lu Xiu and raised his head. “Lu Xiu, you go first!””

“Chenyu...”Lu Xiu was very worried about song Chenyu.

“Go!”

“Lu Xiu looked at song Chenyu, then turned to CEN Yuyan and warned, “Cen Yuyan, if you dare to hurt Chenyu again, I won’t let you off!””

“Cen Yuyan sneered, “What a pair of lovers! So I’m the only one who’s a fool!””

“”Lu Xiu! Leave quickly!”Afraid that Lu Xiu would say something, song Chenyu shouted at Lu Xiu.”

“Lu Xiu lowered his head and looked at song chenyu, “Call me if there’s anything!””
