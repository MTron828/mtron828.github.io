“Actually, the s galaxy was the same as Earth, there was no kneeling ceremony. ”

“However, ye Zao had done a great favor to the Feng clan, so Mr. Feng swore that all members of the Feng clan must kneel down on one knee to thank ye Zao for saving their lives. ”

“Even though ye Zao had said many times that there was no need to kneel, they still maintained this rule until now. ”

Seeing this scene.

The guests thought that they were hallucinating.

What did Mr. Feng Call Ye Zao?

Miss Ye?

What did Leo Call Ye Zao?

Father Zao?

“In the s galaxy, other than that Miss ye who could make Mr. Feng and Leo respect her so much, there was really no one else who could call her that. ”

Could it be that the person on the stage was Miss Ye?

This was too shocking!

“Just a second ago, Ye Zao was still a fake. ”

“”Mr. Feng, get up quickly.”Ye Zao helped Mr. Feng Up with one hand. ”

“Mr. Feng stood up from the ground. “Congratulations, Miss Ye.” ”

“Thank you.”

“Mr. Feng looked at Cen Shaoqing again. “Congratulations, Young Master Dongli.” ”

“Then, without waiting for Cen Shaoqing to speak, mr. Feng continued, “No matter what, Miss Ye will always be our Miss Ye. If Young Master Dongli treats miss ye badly, even if it’s the entire alliance, even if we have to risk our lives, we would still dare to provoke him.” ”

These words were a reminder and also a warning.

These people were ye Zao’s capital!

Whoever dared to go against ye Zao would be going against them!

“Once these words were said, the JY team, Leo, Ye Han, the elders of the eight great clans, as well as the big shots from all sides, all stood behind ye Zao. ”

What was haughty.

This was haughty.

Cen Shaoqing had never been threatened by anyone in his entire life.

This was the first time.

“However, he admitted defeat. He was willing to drink as if it was his own. ”

“Cen Shaoqing turned around slightly and faced the crowd. He opened his thin lips and said, “Don’t worry, everyone. I will not let ye Zao Down in this life. If I break my oath, I will be at your disposal!” ”

“Today, he was not dressed in plain clothes. Instead, he was dressed in a suit and leather shoes. His imposing manner was like a rainbow. It was clearly a very simple sentence, but it was not something that could be interfered with. ”

It was powerful.

“Some people were born to be dragons and phoenixes among men. Even if they stood there and did nothing, they could still leave others in the dust. ”

“Mr. Feng nodded and continued, “With young master’s words, I’m relieved. Now, can young master please explain about Miss Duanmu’s matter? We Can’t let Miss ye be seriously injured by rumors for no reason!” ”

“Cen Shaoqing continued to speak, “The rumors about me and Duanmu Feng being engaged are just rumors. From the beginning to the end, Duanmu Feng and I are just strangers who have never met before. How can there be an engagement? “Whether in the past or in the future, my girlfriend and fiancée are only ye Zhuo.” ”

With that said.

The audience was silent.

No one expected Cen Shaoqing to give such an answer.

“Initially, everyone thought that Cen Shaoqing would say that he and Duanmu Fengyu had already broken off their engagement ”

“However, he directly denied the engagement with Duanmu Fengyu. ”

“They also did not expect that the person standing beside Cen Shaoqing was actually Miss Ye, who was high and mighty and looked down on the world. ”

“Especially Duanmu Fengyu, she was completely dumbfounded. ”

She could not even react in time.

She had originally wanted to see ye Zao make a fool of himself.

She had never thought that ye Zao would slap her in the face.

What was going on?

How did ye Zao turn into Miss Ye?

“If ye Zao was Miss Ye, then what was she? ”

What was she?

“Ye Zao was clearly the mistress who had interfered in other people’s feelings, but now, she was the one who interfered in other people’s feelings. ”

She was unwilling.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

She was really unwilling.

“But at this moment, no matter how unwilling she was, she could only endure it. ”

The person who should have been standing by Cen Shaoqing’s side tonight should have been her.

“Ye Han, Mr. Feng, Leo, JY team, and the others should have come to support her! ”

Why did ye Zao snatch them away!

How did ye Zao become the high and Mighty Miss Ye?

What exactly happened?

“”If I were Duanmu Fengyu, I would just find a hole in the ground and hide in it!” ”

“Others are still waiting to be the future wife of the Chief Alliance!”

“”She thinks that if her aunt can become the wife of the Chief Alliance, she can definitely do it! How Shameless!” ”

The sarcastic voice penetrated Duanmu Fengyu’s ears.

Humans.

They were too realistic.

“Even if they were separated from the hypocritical earth, they would never change. ”

“Before the banquet started, they were still flattering her, but in the blink of an eye, she had become that shameless person. ”
