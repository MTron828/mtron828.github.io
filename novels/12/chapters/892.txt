Translator: 549690339

“Ye Zao’s eyes were indifferent as he looked at Cen Yuyan. “Since fourth sister already knows that she’s wrong, then forget it.””

“Cen Shaoqing lowered his head and looked at Cen Yuyan, “Just because I don’t tell you some things doesn’t mean that I don’t know. I don’t want to ask about your personal matters. “But if you provoke Zao again next time, Don’t blame me for not caring about blood and family ties. “Listen carefully, Luoluo is my final line!””

Final line.

Cen Yuyan never dreamed that ye Zhuo was actually Cen Shaoqing’s final line.

“Then what was she, his fourth sister?”

“In Cen Shaoqing’s heart, did he still have her, his fourth sister?”

Cen Shaoqing’s words made Cen Yuyan break out in cold sweat. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“As he finished speaking, CEN Shaoqing pressed the communication device on his ear. “Come in and take Cen Yuyan away.””

Cen Yuyan did not have time to react before she was taken away by Cen Shaoqing’s two assistants.

He did not care about the relationship between brother and sister at all.

“Cen Yuyan originally thought that this trip would bring justice to Song Chenyu, but she did not expect that not only did she not get justice, but she was even slapped twice by Cen Shaoqing.”

“In the end, she was dragged out like a dead dog.”

Cen Yuyan couldn’t accept this at all.

Cen Yuyan was too embarrassed to go back and see song Chenyu after getting into such a sorry state with Ye Zao.

“She was Cen Shaoqing’s fourth sister, but she was slapped twice by CEN Shaoqing because of an outsider. Where was she supposed to put her face?”

No.

She couldn’t let song Chenyu know that she was slapped by Cen Shaoqing.

It wasn’t just that she couldn’t let song Chenyu know.

She had to hide it from the others as well.

Cen Yuyan clenched her fists tightly.

The person Cen Shaoqing liked should be song Chenyu.

“If it was song Chenyu, she would definitely not treat herself this way.”

Just wait.

“One day, Cen Shaoqing would regret it.”

Cen Yuyan lowered her head and walked towards the hospital.

“After the doctor saw Cen Yuyan’s injury, he frowned and said, “Miss, are you being abused? Do you need help? Your injury has already caused a slight concussion!””

The doctor had met many women who had been abused.

He had also helped many people to call the police.

“Seeing Cen Yuyan’s injury like this, the doctor subconsciously thought that Cen Yuyan had been abused.”

“Hearing that she had been beaten up by Cen Shaoqing to a mild concussion, Cen Yuyan was even more furious.”

She was Cen Shaoqing’s biological sister.

But Cen Shaoqing had done such a ruthless thing to her!

What was so good about ye Zao?

He had actually charmed Cen Shaoqing to this extent.

“Seeing that Cen Yuyan did not speak for a long time, the doctor continued to ask, “Miss, do you need help?””

“”Thank you, no need.”Cen Yuyan finally reacted and raised her head to look at the doctor.”

“The doctor nodded and continued, “You need to be hospitalized for observation for three days. Go and settle the hospitalization procedures first.””

“Okay.”Cen Yuyan nodded and stood up to walk to the first floor.

Song Chenyu’s side.

Song Chenyu had been observing the situation on Weibo.

“Logically speaking, Cen Yuyan had already found ye Zao.”

But why had ye Zao not posted a clarification on Weibo?

“Not only did he not clarify, he did not even delete the reply that tagged her.”

What was going on?

Could it be that ye Zhuo was unwilling to delete it?

“However, Cen Yuyan was Cen Shaoqing’s elder sister after all.”

Wasn’t Ye Zhuo afraid of making Cen Shaoqing unhappy?

“She was much younger than Cen Shaoqing to begin with, and there was no love between the two of them. It was all because of Old Lady Cen’s matchmaking...”

“If ye Zhuo offended Cen Yuyan,.”

Would Cen Shaoqing Forgive Ye Zhuo?

Definitely Not!

“Song Chenyu had known Cen Yuyan for a few years. Cen Shaoqing might be cold to outsiders, but he still respected Cen Yuyan as his sister.”

Cen Shaoqing would definitely not fall out with Cen Yuyan over ye Zao.

Therefore...

Ye Zao had to delete Weibo!

He had to apologize and ye Zao had to say it too!

Ye Zi was definitely going to suffer this loss.

“In the end, she would still be the winner in life.”

“Thinking of this, the corners of Song Chenyu’s lips curled up.”

She was waiting for ye Zao to personally post an apology to her on Weibo.

“When that time came, the scene would definitely be lively.”

“Chenyu.”

“Her manager, brother Tao, pushed the door open and entered.”

“”Brother Tao, What’s Wrong?”Song Chenyu looked up.”

“Brother Tao continued, “Chenyu, Miss Ye’s matter hasn’t gone down yet. Try to be careful these few days and don’t frequently log in on Weibo.””

“”Okay.”Song Chenyu nodded and continued, “Oh right, brother Tao, I think I should be discharged soon. Don’t I still have two commercials to shoot the day after tomorrow?””

She started shooting commercials before she was fully recovered.

Which female celebrity in the entertainment industry was more dedicated than her?
