“Seeing song Chenyu here, Cen Yuyan didn’t even have the mood to watch the movie. She turned around and walked out. ”

Song Chenyu immediately followed Cen Yuyan.

“Cen Yuyan had come in Zhou Rui’s car today. Now that Zhou Rui had something to do and left, CEN Yuyan could only call the driver to pick her up. ”

“But when she picked up her phone to make a call, Cen Yuyan was dumbfounded. ”

Her phone was out of battery.

“Song Chenyu immediately took out his phone. “Yuyan, I’ll let you use my phone.” ”

“I don’t want it!”Cen Yuyan put her phone back into her bag and turned to walk to the roadside.

Song Chenyu also followed Cen Yuyan’s footsteps.

He didn’t say anything and just followed Cen Yuyan.

Cen Yuyan turned to look at song Chenyu. “Can you not follow me?”

“Song Chenyu looked at Cen Yuyan, “Yuyan, I didn’t know that Lu Xiu liked me before. If it wasn’t for Lu Xiu’s sudden confession, I wouldn’t have known about this at all! We’re best friends. What benefits do you think I have by lying to you?” ”

“”Do you know that you know in your heart!”Cen Yuyan continued, “Song Chenyu, I’ve already been lied to by you once. Do you think I’ll be lied to again? Do you really think I’m a Fool?” ”

“Yuyan...”song Chenyu’s eyes were red from crying. “Please believe me. I really didn’t lie to you. I don’t know how things turned out like this...”

Cen Yuyan didn’t want to listen to Song Chenyu’s nonsense. She turned around and continued walking.

“She originally wanted to walk to the main road and take a taxi back, but she didn’t expect to actually walk into a small alley. ”

Song Chenyu still followed behind her.

“It was still very lively at eight o’clock at night, and residential buildings were on both sides of the alley, so it wasn’t that scary. ”

“Song Chenyu looked upstairs, and an old lady holding a flower pot looked at her. ”

“Three, two, one. ”

The flower pot that was originally in the old lady’s hand suddenly fell down.

“”Yuyan, be careful!” ”

“Before Cen Yuyan could react, her entire body was pushed away by song Chenyu. ”

“Cen Yuyan was shocked. By the time she reacted, song Chenyu was already on the ground with blood all over his face. ”

“Chenyu! Are You Alright? Don’t Scare Me!”Cen Yuyan took out her phone from song Chenyu’s bag with trembling hands and called the ambulance.

“Soon, the ambulance arrived. ”

Song Chenyu was sent to the emergency room.

“Half an hour later, the emergency room’s door opened and Cen Yuyan immediately walked over. “How is it, doctor? Is My Friend Alright?” ”

The Doctor took off his mask. “The wound on the injured person’s head is a little deep. Just the surface layer alone has more than 30 stitches. She needs to be hospitalized for observation for three days. Go to the first floor to go through the hospitalization procedures.”

“Hearing this, Cen Yuyan was shocked. ”

“She did not expect song Chenyu to be injured so deeply. If song Chenyu had not pushed her away in time, she would be the one injured now. ”

Cen Yuyan recovered after a while and went to the first floor to go through the hospitalization procedures.

“After going through the hospitalization procedures, Cen Yuyan came to the ward. Song Chenyu was already awake. When he saw Cen Yuyan coming over, he immediately smiled and asked, “Yuyan, are you alright?” ”

Cen Yuyan’s nose turned sour.

“Song Chenyu was clearly the one who was injured, but Song Chenyu was concerned about whether she was alright. ”

“”I’m fine, but you almost died.”Cen Yuyan took out her phone and placed it on the bedside to charge it. “The Doctor said that you had more than thirty stitches on your head. Does it hurt?” ”

“”It doesn’t hurt.”Song Chenyu shook his head and continued, “Yuyan, can you forgive me?” ”

Cen Yuyan didn’t say anything.

“Although song Chenyu had saved her once, she still couldn’t get over that hurdle. ”

“Song Chenyu continued, “Yuyan, please believe me. Before this, I really didn’t know that Lu Xiu liked me. I was also very surprised when he suddenly confessed to me last night! I don’t even know why he did that!” ”

“”Later, when I went back, I thought about it. The reason he did this was probably to sow discord.” ”

Sow discord?

“When she heard this, Cen Yuyan raised her head and looked at song Chenyu. ”

“Song Chenyu continued, “Yuyan, I grew up with Lu Xiu. If he really liked me, he would have confessed his love long ago. Why did you wait until last night? Did you really not think about the reason?” ”

“What reason?”Cen Yuyan asked.

“Song Chenyu continued, “Someone instructed him to do this behind the scenes. The goal is to sow discord between us.” ”

Cen Yuyan narrowed her eyes.

Was that really the case?

“Then, who was the person who instructed Lu Xiu behind the scenes? ”
