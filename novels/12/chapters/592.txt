“After all, Old Mrs. Lin had been trying to fix up Feng Qianhua and Lin Jincheng. ”

“But now, Lin Jincheng had already found ye Shu. They were also meddling in Feng Xianxian’s matter. What was going on? ”

“Didn’t you hear what I Said?”Old Mrs. Lin continued to ask.

“The few of them looked at each other, hesitating. ”

“Seeing this, Old Mrs. Lin became even angrier. ”

They had turned against her!

They had turned against her!

“Now, they actually didn’t listen to her. ”

This must be ye Shu instigating something behind her back.

If it weren’t for Ye Shu...

They wouldn’t be so bold.

“After a while, Wu Mei stood up and said, “I heard it! Don’t worry, Mom. We’ll all go to Xianxian’s award ceremony on Saturday.” ”

The others nodded in agreement.

Only then was old Mrs. Lin satisfied.

“After discussing this matter, old Mrs. Lin came to the hall. ”

“Feng Qianhua walked to Old Mrs. Lin’s side and said in a low voice, “Aunt Lin, I have something to discuss with you.” ” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“What is it?”Old Mrs. Lin asked.

“Feng Qianhua looked at Lin Qingxuan, who was chatting with her brothers. “Aunt Lin, look at my brothers. All of them have children, and only my fourth brother is alone. I feel really uncomfortable looking at him.” ”

“Hearing this, Old Madam Lin Sighed, “Don’t talk about you. As a mother, I feel even worse! This is all my fault. If I hadn’t insisted on marrying Zhao shinning to Qingxuan, Qingxuan wouldn’t have fallen to this State!” ”

Lin Qingxuan should have had a full house too.

This was all her fault!

It was all her fault!

She was the one who had harmed her son.

“Thinking of this, Old Mrs. Lin’s eyes reddened again. ”

“Feng Qianhua comforted old Mrs. Lin, “Aunt Lin, don’t blame yourself. After all, you were doing this for fourth brother’s good. How many mothers would harm their own sons? No one expected this to happen. Even I didn’t expect Shu Ning to be such a person!” ”

Feng Qianhua’s words hit right into old Mrs. Lin’s heart.

Although she had always said that she was to blame for this matter.

But she was also thinking for Lin Qingxuan’s sake.

Her motive was for Lin Qingxuan’s own good.

“Although Lin Qingxuan said that he was not to blame for this matter, old madam Lin knew that Lin Qingxuan was still blaming her from the bottom of her heart. ”

Even her other sons and daughters-in-law felt that this matter was her fault.

“Now, only Feng Qianhua could understand her. ”

“Old Madam Lin looked at Feng Qianhua. “Qianhua, it would be great if Qingxuan could think like you. Tell me, how many mothers in the world would harm their sons?” ”

“Feng Qianhua smiled and said, “Aunt Lin, maybe fourth brother didn’t blame you at all. You guessed it yourself!” ”

Old Madam Lin Sighed and didn’t say anything.

“Feng Qianhua continued, “Aunt Lin, have you ever thought of introducing fourth brother to someone who can live? Fourth Brother is only in his early forties this year. It’s still not too late to have a child while he’s still young.” ”

“”I’ve thought about it, but I haven’t met anyone suitable!”Old Mrs. Lin looked at Feng Qianhua. “Qianhua, do you have anyone suitable by your side?” ”

“Lin Qingxuan was already forty-two years old this year, so there was indeed no room for delay. ”

“Feng Qianhua hesitated for a moment before continuing, “I do have one, but I don’t know if fourth brother would like it.” ”

Madam Lin’s eyes lit up. “Oh? Which family’s Lady?”

“The Jiang family.”

“The Jiang Family?”Madam Lin Thought for a moment. “Does the Jiang family have a lady of the right age?”

“Feng Qianhua said, “Do you know the second daughter of the Jiang family, Jiang Suran?” ”

Jiang Suran?

“Although the Jiang family was also part of the rich and powerful circle, Old Madam Lin didn’t know about Jiang Suran because her family had almost never been around. ”

“”Tell me about this Jiang Suran,”old madam Lin said. ”

“Feng Qianhua pulled old madam Lin to sit down on the sofa and continued, “Jiang Suran is 38 years old this year. Although she’s not young, she’s still a virgin and has never been married.” ”

“Feng Qianhua paused, then, she continued, “And I heard that Jiang Suran took a female morality training course and spent two years in it. I Can’t guarantee anything else, but if fourth brother were to be with Jiang Suran, Jiang Suran would definitely be a good wife for her husband and children.” ”

Female Durban?

“Hearing this, Old Madam Lin was a little surprised. “Really?” ”

“Female Durban mainly focused on the promotion of ‘female morality’as the main content of the training class. Female Durban’s students had to do it: not fighting back, not responding to curses, not accepting things as they were, and never getting divorced. ”

“Husband as the sky, son as the Earth. ”
