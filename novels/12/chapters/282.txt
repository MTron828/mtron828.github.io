Ye Zao nodded. “Do you know where Pingting’s ward is?”

“”Yes, let’s go quickly.” ”

Ye Zao followed an Lizi’s footsteps.

“Soon, the two of them arrived at the inpatient department, Zhao Pingting’s ward. ”

Ye Zao knocked on the door. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Soon, the door opened. ”

The person who opened the door was Zhao Pingting.

“Zao Zao! Lizi!”

“An Lizi’s eyes were red. “Pingting, are you alright?” ”

Zhao Pingting smiled and shook her head. “I’m Fine! Come in and have a seat!”

“Seeing ye Zao and an Lizi, Zhao Pingting was in a bad mood. Zhao Pingting’s parents, Zhao Yingjun, and Tang Jia were all in the ward. Zhao Pingting introduced ye Zao and an Lizi to her family. ”

“”Dad, Mom, Big Brother, sister-in-law, this is my classmate, Zhuo Zhuo. This is Lizi.” ”

“Ye Zhuo and an Lizi also greeted them politely. “Hello, uncle and Auntie! Hello, Big Brother and sister-in-law!” ”

“”Hello, Hello.”Zhao Pingting’s mother stood up and said, “Thank you for coming to visit Pingting.” ”

Ye Zhuo and an Lizi were Zhao Pingting’s first classmates to visit her after her accident.

“Therefore, her family was very polite to them. ”

Tang Jia was busy pouring water for the two of them.

An Lizi placed the things on the cabinet in front of the bed. “Pingting is our best friend. It’s our duty to visit her.”

“Ye Zhuo took the water from Tang Jia with both hands. “Thank you, sister-in-law.” ”

“You’re welcome.”It was also at this moment that Tang Jia saw the face hidden under the hat clearly.

What a beautiful girl!

Tang Jia sighed in her heart.

“Ye Zhuo drank a mouthful of water and turned to look at Zhao Pingting. “Pingting, what did your doctor say?” ”

“Zhao pingting smiled and said, “Lung cancer is in the middle and late stages. There’s no medicine left to treat it. Now, we can only treat it with radiation.” ”

“”Radiation treatment?”Ye Zhuo frowned slightly and reached out to put his hand on Zhao Pingting’s wrist to listen to her pulse. After a moment, she slowly opened her mouth, “The cancer cells have already begun to metastasize to the bone. Radiation therapy is no longer of any use. It will only increase the pain. Pingting, I am confident that I can cure your lung cancer. Are you willing to believe me?” ”

Hearing this.

Zhao Pingting was stunned.

The other people standing at the side were also stunned.

Ye Zao said that she could cure lung cancer?

How Old was she?

Was she eighteen years old?

“Zao Zao?”

“Ye Zao continued, “As long as you are willing to believe me, I will immediately negotiate with the hospital and arrange for an operation for you.” ”

Zhao Pingting looked at ye Zao’s face and then nodded firmly. “Okay! I believe you!”

“Mother Zhao could not help but say, “Little girl, you and our Pingting are classmates. It’s already very pitiful for her to have this kind of illness now. Don’t joke around with her!” ”

“”Auntie, I’m not joking.”Ye Zhuo turned to look at Mother Zhao. ”

“In fact, it was not just mother Zhao. ”

The other people in the ward also thought that Ye Zhuo was joking.

“Zhao pingting quickly said, “Mom! I’m not joking anymore! I believe her. Oh right, she was the one who told me about the weight loss recipe!” ”

“When it came to the weight loss recipe, mother Zhao’s expression changed. ”

“Before this, Zhao Pingting was very fat. ”

She tried many methods but failed to lose weight.

“Ever since she used a secret recipe, she had successfully lost more than 80 pounds! ”

“Zhao pingting continued, “Dad, Mom, Big Brother, sister-in-law, there’s no way to cure my illness in the hospital. Since Zhuojiao said there’s a way, let her try! “Anyway, I’m already like this now. How Bad Can I be? “Furthermore, Zhuozhu studied Chinese medicine and received the guidance of an expert. I believe in her ability!” ”

That’s right!

Advanced stage lung cancer!

“There was still hope if she tried. If she didn’t try, there wouldn’t even be hope. ”

“Father Zhao stood up and said, “Pingting, Dad believes in you and also in your classmate.” ”

“Since Father Zhao had spoken, the others did not say anything else. ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Uncle, who is Pingting’s attending physician? Can you bring me over?” ”

“Sure.”Father Zhao nodded.

Ye Zhuo followed Father Zhao’s footsteps.

They arrived at the door of the attending physician’s office.

The attending physician’s name was Zhu Zheng.

“”Hello, doctor Zhu. My surname is Ye.”Ye Zhuo directly stated his purpose of coming, “I am a descendant of traditional Chinese medicine. I have been studying cancer for a long time. I am 100% confident that I can cure my classmate Zhao Pingting’s lung cancer. I hope that your hospital will cooperate with me. In return, I can pass on the method to cure cancer to the doctors of your hospital without reservation.” ”

Cure cancer?

“If cancer could be cured, it would benefit all mankind! ”

What a pity!

There was no medicine to cure cancer.

“”Little girl, How Old Are You? Do you know what you are talking about? Cure Cancer?”Even the director of their hospital did not dare to say that. This little girl was really bold! She dared to brag like that! ”

“I can really cure cancer.”

“Zhu Zheng smiled and said, “I won’t say anything else. Do you have a doctor’s certificate, a pharmacist’s certificate, and a Chinese Medical Doctor’s Certificate?” ”

Ye Zhuo did not say anything. She lowered her head and rummaged through her bag.

“Seeing her like this, Zhu Zheng knew that she was feeling guilty, so he used the action of rummaging through the bag to cover up his embarrassment. He continued, “You don’t even have these basic certificates. Are you telling me that you can cure cancer?” ”

“As soon as he said this, Ye Zhuo took out three books from her bag and placed them on the table. “These are my doctor’s certificate, Pharmacist’s certificate, and a Chinese medical doctor’s certificate.” ”
