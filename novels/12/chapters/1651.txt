Translator: 549690339

“When Cen he saw this report from C Nation, he was stunned. ”

He did not think that Dr. Cara would have such a flashy operation.

“He had clearly signed the bet agreement, and now he was denying it! ”

This Dr. Cara was too shameless!

As soon as he finished speaking.

“Cen he immediately handed the tablet to ye Zhuo, he said angrily, “Miss Ye, Look, this is Dr. Cara’s international statement. Not only did he not admit to the bet agreement, he even accused us of secretly changing the contents of the agreement! Most importantly, the notary office even showed him the proof!” ”

“Ye Zao took the tablet, but there was no expression on his handsome face. ”

It was as if she knew about this in advance.

“C country was a technological country, so Dr. Cara was naturally unwilling to hand over his base! After all, Dr. Cara had taken a liking to the Cen family’s base from the very beginning! Even he himself probably did not expect that he would lose both his wife and his soldiers. ”

“Therefore, Ye Zao was not surprised that such a thing had happened. ”

“Seeing ye Zao like this, cen he asked curiously, “Miss Ye, aren’t you angry at all?” ”

One had to know that he was so angry that he was dumbfounded!

“It was clearly Dr. Cara who did not have any spirit of the contract. Not only did he break the contract, but now he was also blaming all the blame on ye Zao, saying that ye Zao had changed the content of the agreement. ”

“If it were anyone else, ye Zao would probably have lost control long ago. ”

“Seeing how calm ye Zao was, Cen he thought that he was hallucinating and reached out to wipe his eyes. ”

But the truth told him that ye Zao was not angry.

“It’s not worth it to be angry with such a person.”Ye Zao’s tone was indifferent. It was clear that he did not take this matter to heart.

“”I also know that it’s not worth it to be angry with such a person, but we have to find a way to solve the matter.”CEN he continued, “We can’t let Cara throw a bucket of SH * t on us for no reason!” ”

“”There’s no rush.”Ye Zhuo sat down and studied the ice crystal again, his eyes indifferent. ”

“The ice crystal was blue and transparent. Under the illumination of the lights, it flashed with seven-colored light. It plated on her fair hand, adding a bit of coldness to it. ”

“Seeing that she was neither arrogant nor impatient, cen he was extremely anxious, “It’s already on fire, Miss Ye. You still say there’s no rush!”! This bet was proposed by Kara first. Now, not only did he not admit it, he even caused so many disgusting things! “Do you think he’s still human? “Miss Ye, are you really going to suffer this loss?” ”

“At this moment, Tang Mi walked out with a smile. “Erhe, don’t worry! Miss Ye isn’t picky about food. She eats everything, but she doesn’t suffer any losses.” ”

“Having been by Ye Zao’s side for so long, Tang Mi really understood ye Zao too well. ”

“Although C nation’s operation was somewhat unexpected, Tang Mi believed that ye Zao definitely had a way to resolve it. Otherwise, ye Zao wouldn’t be so calm. ”

“Hearing this, Cen he turned to look at Tang Mi. “Then does Miss Ye have a way?” ”

Tang mi nodded. “En. Don’t worry. Miss ye definitely has a way to resolve it. Go back and tell everyone that you don’t have to worry with Miss ye around.”

“CEN he nodded, feeling much more at ease. ”

“Ye Zao slightly raised his eyes and continued, “Have the people we’ve arranged for the past already arrived in C Nation?” ”

“”They did arrive, but they were refused entry,”Cen he said. ”

Ye Zhuo’s beautiful eyes narrowed. “Refused entry?”

“”Yes.”CEN he continued, “Miss Ye, should we let them return first?” ”

“No need.”Ye Zhuo’s tone was slow. “Call worker Xu and tell him that Kara will personally apologize to them before today.”

“Really?”Cen He’s eyes lit up.

Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“That’s great! Then I’ll immediately tell worker Xu and the others about this good news!”

“”Okay, go.” ”

Cen he turned around and walked out of the door.

“As soon as he walked out, Cen Hai immediately came up to him and asked anxiously, “How is it? What did Miss Ye Say?” ”

“Don’t worry. Tang Mi said that miss ye will eat anything but lose.”Cen he patted Cen Hai’s shoulder. “Miss Ye has a lot of ways to treat them.” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Cen Hai scratched his hair and asked curiously, “What methods does miss ye have?” ”

“”I don’t know the specifics either. Anyway, Miss Ye has a way!”CEN he continued, “Miss ye also said that before today, she will definitely make Kara personally apologize to worker Xu and the others!” ”

“Really?”Cen Hai asked in disbelief.

“”Of course it’s true!”Cen he smiled and said, “When has miss ye ever lied and bragged?” ”
