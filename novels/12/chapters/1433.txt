“In the end, professor Yue sobbed. Anyone with a discerning eye could see that professor Yue had been wronged. ”

“Seeing professor Yue like this, everyone discussed and guessed what kind of wrongs professor Yue had suffered. ”

“A moment later, Sun Yu stood up and said, “Teacher, are you retiring early because of Miss Ye’s matter?” ” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Professor Yue was silent for a moment before continuing, “Actually, it has nothing to do with Miss Ye. It’s because I shouldn’t have offended Miss Ye. Being retired early is a punishment that I should accept.” ”

So it was really because of ye Zhuo!

“Hearing this, Sun Yu said angrily, “On what basis? It was clearly miss ye who bullied others first. On what basis should I let you retire?”Professor Yue had been in the base for nearly twenty years, he had made a lot of contributions to the base. What had ye Zhuo done for the base? ”

“Moreover, this was in itself ye Zhuo’s fault! ”

On what basis did she let Professor Yue retire?

“Although it sounded like a retirement, it was actually a dismissal. ”

The most important thing was that the early retirement pension was only one-fifth of the full-age retirement pension.

“In other words, professor Yue himself had a pension of fifty thousand yuan. Now, he could only get ten thousand yuan. The honor that should have been given to professor Yue would also not be given to him. ”

“If a big shot like professor Yue were to retire at the age of full age, she would be hired by some universities to be a professor. ”

But Now?

“Professor Yue had been retired early, and her resume had been added with a disgraceful stroke. Without Cen Shaoqing’s guarantee and recommendation, no university would be willing to hire her! ”

“Whether it was from the point of view of money or honor, early retirement was very disadvantageous to Professor Yue! ”

“Hearing these words, the other members of the department were also indignant. ”

Indignant!

It was really infuriating!

Was there any justice in this world?

“The one who was wronged was obviously professor Yue, but now, professor Yue was actually retired early! ”

“”We should have gotten ye Zhuo to get out of the base!”Sun Yu continued, “Ever since ye Zhuo came to the base, the base has been in a mess. The most ridiculous thing is that she still made some big talk about building a space mothership. Not only is it a waste of resources, it has also affected the safety of our lives!” ”

“As soon as she said that, the members of the department immediately nodded in agreement. ”

“”Let alone a space mothership, I don’t think she can even build a space ship!” ”

Building a space ship required many years of space experience as well as scientific research foundation.

What did ye Zao have?

Did she have space experience or scientific research foundation?

Didn’t Ye Zao get first place in the science and Technology competition once?

Who knew if she cheated!

“I really don’t know why master five trusted her so much!”

“It’s because of her face!”

“I never thought that one day our master five would also be distracted by beauty! No wonder there were so many stupid emperors in ancient times!”

“Sun Yu interrupted the crowd, “It’s useless to talk about other things now. The most important thing now is how to get justice for Professor Yue! The one who should get lost is ye Zao. We can’t let Professor Yue suffer this injustice for nothing!” ”

“”Sun Yu is right. If you want to get lost, it’s Ye Zao who should get lost!”A tall girl stood up and said, “Why don’t we work together and find master five to reason with! “If master five doesn’t give us an answer, we will go on a collective strike!” ”

“Sun Yu immediately raised her hand and shouted, “Collective strike!” ”

“When he shouted, everyone immediately shouted, “Strike! Strike!” ”

Professor Yue looked at everyone and felt a little excited.

“She had long known that she had a great influence. There were more than fifty members in the department. If all fifty of them really went on strike, the nuclear project would not be able to continue, and the nuclear project would not be able to continue, the experimental report would not be able to be submitted within the stipulated time, and the order would not be completed on time. ”

“At that time, the base would be in a half-paralyzed state. She did not believe that Cen Shaoqing would dare to take such a risk. ”

The members of the department also had the same thoughts as professor Yue.

“They were all important technicians. In Zone B of the Cen’s base, they were like hearts. ”

What was the most important thing in the human body?

“Of course, it was the heart! ”

“Once the heart stopped beating, then this person would not be able to change anything. ”

“As long as they worked together, they would definitely be able to make Cen Shaoqing compromise and bow his head to Professor Yue. ”

“Seeing everyone like this, although Professor Yue was quite happy, she did not show the slightest bit of it, “I appreciate everyone’s kindness, but it’s really not worth it to do this for me. In fact, it’s really good to retire early. I don’t feel wronged at all. There’s no need for all of you to challenge Master Five for me.” ”
