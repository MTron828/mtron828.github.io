Chapter 197: 089: Lin Jin city’s secret, the trap-digging brother Ze, domineering online! 3

Ye Zao prepared to tidy up her room.

All she could see in her room were electronics. The computer mainframe, the green circuit board, the PCBA, the diode...

The scariest thing was that there were soldering tools.

If she hadn’t seen it with her own eyes, no one would believe that this was a girl’s room.

After tidying up his room, Ye Zhuo took the watering can and went to spray water on the plants in ye Shu’s room.

Ye Shu was a very clean person.

The room was also tidied up neatly. There wasn’t even a single wrinkle on the Quilt.

Ye Zhuo slowly sprayed water on the plants.

“PA –”

He accidentally knocked the book on the table.

Ye Zao picked up the book.

It was a Chinese version of a famous foreign novel.

“Jane Eyre”

......

The cover of the book had been worn white, and it looked like it had been there for many years.

Ye Zao casually flipped through a few pages of the book, and a photo that was sandwiched in the book suddenly appeared in front of him.

This was a photo that felt very old.

There was a man and a woman in the photo.

Ye Zao did not recognize the man.

But the woman was obviously the young Ye Shu.

In fact, the current ye Shu did not look much different from the person in the photo.

It was just that.

At that time, she looked much more immature than she did now. Her eyes were bright, and it could be seen from her eyes that she loved the man standing next to her terribly.

The man was very tall, with thick eyebrows and big eyes. His facial features were extremely handsome.

Standing next to the woman, he looked like a man and a woman!

Ye Zao narrowed his eyes slightly.

If she guessed correctly, this man should be her cheap father, right?

Don’t say.

He looked quite decent.

No wonder he could trick the 19-year-old ye Shu’s unmarried daughter. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows and put the photo back.

...

On the other side.

The Mu family.

Mu Yourong completed three missions under the guidance of the system.

Although three missions were not a lot,.

It still caused a stir on the international science and Technology website.

After all, Mu Yourong’s account was still a newcomer, and she was also a woman.

On this website, women were a rare species.

During this period of time, there had been people taking the initiative to add Mu Yourong as a friend.

Mu Yourong, who was in front of the screen, curled the corners of her lips. She knew that she would definitely become the most eye-catching existence.

Now, Niu Hulu YC and Hua en would definitely have noticed her.

At that time, the two giants of the technology world would become her vassals!

A woman’s success was not only her career.

It was also her personality and charm.

At this moment, a system notification sounded in her mind: [ warning! Li Qiandong’s favorability towards you has decreased from 80% to 20% . Host, please immediately think of a way to increase your favorability! ]

Hearing this, mu yourong frowned, “What’s going on?”

The system continued: [ host, it’s been a long time since you’ve shown your presence in front of Li Qiandong! ]

“Can you find Li Qiandong’s whereabouts now?”

[ I’ll try. ]

Due to Mu Yourong’s performance on the international website, the system had already leveled up by two levels. In a short while, the system found out Li Qiandong’s itinerary.

Looking at Li Qiandong’s itinerary.

Mu Yourong had a plan in her heart.

In a short while, Mu Yourong was dressed neatly and walked out of the Mu residence.

On the road where cars were coming and going.

The green lights flickered, alternating with the yellow lights. At this moment, a little boy rushed out quickly.

“Beep!”

A piercing whistle sounded behind him.

At this moment, a figure rushed out quickly and protected the little boy in front of him.

The moment she held the little boy in her arms, a calculating light appeared in Mu Yourong’s eyes.

“Bang!”

The two of them were knocked to the ground.

The car door was opened and a man in a suit walked out of the car.

“Are you guys okay?”

This person was none other than Li Qiandong.

“I’m fine.”Mu Yourong raised her head slightly.

“Miss Mu!”Li Qiandong said in surprise.

“Mr. Li.”Mu Yourong greeted Li Qiandong and pulled the child up from under her. “Little friend, are you alright?”

The child was so frightened that his face turned pale.

At this moment, a middle-aged woman rushed over from the crowd and hugged the child tightly in her arms. “Dongdong, are you alright? You scared me to death!” Youyou turned to look at Mu Yourong. “Miss, thank you so much! If it weren’t for you, my son’s life would have been lost today!”

“Thank you!”

Mu yourong smiled and said, “I’m fine, but as parents, you really have to be careful. When you cross the road, you must take good care of the child!”
