“Boss Wang was very concerned about Zhou cuihua, so the call came right away. ” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Looking at boss Wang’s call, Zhou Cuihua’s mouth was full of a sweet smile, and her heart beat faster. ”

Zhou cuihua slid the phone to answer.

Boss Wang’s worried voice came from the other end of the phone. “Hello.”

“Zhengxuan.”

“Hearing Zhou Cuihua’s voice, boss Wang said anxiously, “Cuihua, What’s wrong? Did Something Happen?” ”

“”Nothing. I’m just feeling a little unwell. You Don’t have to worry,”Zhou Cuihua said. ”

“Then where are you now?”Boss Wang continued to ask.

“Zhou cuihua said, “I’m at home.” ”

“Boss Wang immediately said, “Then I’ll come over to see you.” ”

“Hearing that, Zhou cuihua hurriedly said, “No, no. I’m really fine. You Don’t have to come over.” ”

“Although she said that, boss Wang was still worried. He continued, “Why don’t I Come and take you to the hospital?” ”

“Zhou cuihua smiled and said, “I’m really fine.” ”

“Just then, boss Wang’s secretary came over to ask about official matters. Zhou cuihua immediately said understandingly, “Zhengxuan, you should go and get busy. Don’t worry about me. Work is more important. I’ll hang up first.” ”

“After saying that, Zhou cuihua hung up the phone. ”

“After hanging up the phone, a smile appeared on the corner of Zhou Cuihua’s mouth. ”

What Zhou Cuihua didn’t expect was that boss Wang actually came to the rental house personally half an hour later.

“The moment the door opened, Zhou Cuihua was dumbfounded. ”

She didn’t expect boss Wang to suddenly appear. She subconsciously raised her hand to cover her face.

“Boss Wang immediately noticed her abnormality and asked, “Cuihua, what happened to you?” ”

“N-nothing. I just accidentally fell while walking.”Zhou cuihua subconsciously hid the truth.

“Boss Wang continued, “You fell on your face?” ”

“At this point, boss Wang seemed to have thought of something and continued, “Is it your ex-husband?” ”

“Zhou cuihua immediately denied it. “It’s not him, Zhengxuan. I’m really fine. Don’t bother about it.” ”

“Her marriage with Li Da Long had always been ambiguous. If she were to drag Li da long into it at this time, Zhou Cuihua was worried that boss Wang would find out something. ”

“At that time, the gains would not make up for the losses. ”

“Hearing that, boss Wang continued, “Cuihua, you don’t treat me as an outsider. If you encounter anything in the future, remember to tell me immediately.” ”

“Okay.”Zhou cuihua nodded.

“Boss Wang didn’t ask further and continued, “By the way, did you apply ice on your face? Ice can reduce swelling.” ”

“Zhou cuihua said, “I’ve already applied ice on it just now.” ”

“”That’s good.”Boss Wang nodded, ”

“zhou cuihua continued, “Come in and take a seat.” ”

“Boss Wang followed her in and looked at the environment of the rented house. He then said, “Cuihua, it’s really not suitable for you to recuperate here. It’s not convenient for you to do anything. If you don’t mind, you can move to my place first.” ”

“At this point, boss Wang paused, then, he said, “Don’t worry. I have no intention of taking advantage of you. My Place is big, and there are servants who can serve you. No matter what you do, it’s much more convenient. “Moreover, you should understand my thoughts. I’m not easily moved. You’re the person who makes me want to be responsible for my whole life.” ”

Zhou Cuihua was very happy.

Boss Wang invited her to stay at his house. What did this mean?

It meant that boss Wang had already acknowledged her from the bottom of his heart!

It meant that she was the future mistress of the Wang family!

Good!

This was really great!

“Zhou Cuihua was very excited now, but she still had to be reserved. She couldn’t let boss Wang look down on her. ”

“”Zhengxuan, I know what you mean, but with my current status, it’s not appropriate for me to go to your house, right?” ”

“”There’s nothing inappropriate about it. I don’t lack anything at my place. I just lack a female host.”Boss Wang paused at this point, then he said, “Cuihua, perhaps you will think that my decision is a little frivolous. After all, we have only known each other for less than a month, but please believe me. I’m absolutely sincere to you!” ”

Zhou Cuihua was very touched. “I don’t doubt you. I just feel that it might be a little too soon.”

“Zhou Cuihua was not only touched, she was also very excited. ”

This was great!

She was finally going to become the mistress of the Wang family!

“Boss Wang continued, “I won’t force you to stay at my place. If you think that it’s suitable, we can get married. If you think that I’m not good enough for you, then our marriage will have nothing to do with each other. “We have to get used to each other. Let’s live under the same roof and get used to each other.” ”
