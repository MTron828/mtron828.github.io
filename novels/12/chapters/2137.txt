Man Xing rubbed her forehead with a headache.

“After all, Man Wen was her biological brother. Seeing him like this, man Xing felt very sad. ”

“”Are you going to give it to me or not? I am your biological brother!”Man Wen continued, “If you don’t give it to me, I will go to my parents!” ”

“”Don’t!”Man Xing grabbed man Wen’s hand, “Don’t go look for your parents. They are already old. Can’t you ask them for money every time you look for them? Aren’t you afraid that their hearts will ache?” ”

“What does this have to do with me?”Man Wen said indifferently.

“”This will only happen once. It Won’t happen again!”Man Xing took out his card, he said earnestly, “Man Wen, you’re no longer a child. You’re a man. You Can’t just ask for money. You have to learn to grow up. If you’re not my only brother, I’ll definitely...” ”

“Before man Xing could finish his sentence, he was interrupted impatiently by man Wen. “Alright, Alright. Aren’t you annoying? I got it! You’re like an old mother!” ”

“After saying that, he took the card from man Xing’s hand. His entire action was done in one go. It was as if man Xing owed him money. ”

Man Xing shook his head helplessly.

“I’m leaving First!”Man Wen waved his hand at man Xing without turning his head.

“Man Xing raised his voice and shouted, “Man Wen, mind your own business. Let your parents worry!” ”

Man Wen did not respond to her.

“This kind of thing was not rare in the man family. The servants all looked at man Wen and whispered, “Say, our young lady is so outstanding. Why is the Young Master So Terrible? Is it a genetic mutation?” ”

Man Xing and Man Wen were simply two extremes.

The Manxing siblings were so outstanding that they were like dazzling stars. It was almost impossible to open one’s eyes.

As for Manwen?

“He was simply so ordinary that he could not be any more ordinary. Even if he fell into a crowd, he would not be able to find it. ”

“The person next to him immediately said, “If we are talking about a genetic mutation, it must be the young miss’genetic mutation!” ”

“Why?”

“”Have you forgotten? Our young Miss was born to be the lucky star of the Manxing Nation! “The young master also has an older sister called the full moon. I heard that the full moon was born to be a disaster star. I don’t know how many disasters it brought to the Manxing kingdom, but fortunately, it was lost later! “Otherwise, how could our Manxing Kingdom have its current prosperity!” ”

“The full moon princess had always been a secret in the Manxing kingdom, except for some old people who stayed in the family. ”

“Man Jiangshan and Zhao Dan wanted face, so how could they admit that they had given birth to a jinx! ”

“Even though the full moon was lost later, man Jiangshan and Zhao Dan still pretended to be in great pain, so as to create a good image of their parents. ”

“Of course, these things could not be spread to the public. ”

“”Yes, yes, yes, our Manxing country should thank Miss!” ”

The conversation of the servants was heard by Manxing. She smiled slightly.

Manwen came to the secret base with Fan Mu.

“How is it? Did you get the money?”Fan Mu asked.

“Yes.”Manwen nodded and took out a card from his pocket.

“Fan Mu took the card and sensed it on the sensor. She smiled and said, “80 million star dollars. Your sister really has nothing to say to you.” ”

“”Cut the crap,”man Wen continued, “Get the money out first.” ”

“Naturally, the money that man Xing gave could not be used directly. It had to be obtained through the machines in the entertainment venues before it could be used. ”

“Otherwise, with man Xing’s suspicious personality, he would definitely ask where the money went. ” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Fan Mu swiped the card and said, “Should I say it or not? Man Xing is indeed generous to you.” ”

“Do you think it’s easy to raise a good-for-nothing?”Man Wen looked at Fan Mu.

Fan Mu smiled. “That’s true.”

“After saying that, fan mu continued, “Luckily, you weren’t bewitched by money and weren’t raised crooked. Do you think your sister would be shocked if she knew the real you?” ”

Man Xing had always thought that man Wen was an idiot and had been controlled by her. Little did she know that a dog that would bite wouldn’t bark.

“Moreover, Man Wen was a blood-thirsty wolf. ”

Man Wen did not say anything.

“The next second, Fan Mu handed the card to man Wen. “It’s done.” ”

Man Wen took the card.

“Fan Mu continued, “By the way, have you heard about something?” ”

“What is it?”Man Wen asked.

“”Young Master Dongli is going back to his country!”At this point, an excited look flashed across fan mu’s eyes. ”

“With the new emperor on the throne, some of the laws and regulations of the neighboring countries would also be changed, and various benefits would be introduced. ”

“So What?”Man Wen asked.
