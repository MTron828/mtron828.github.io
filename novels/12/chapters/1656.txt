“Chapter 1657: 347: light speed slaps face, Tang Xue goes to jail! 6”

Translator: 549690339

“Elder sun continued, “Mrs. Tang, it’s not that I don’t want to show mercy, but there’s really no turning back for this matter! Xiaoxue has indeed gone too far. No matter what, she can’t do something like betraying the base! Not to mention that fifth master can’t forgive her, if it were me, I wouldn’t be able to forgive her either.” ”

“”Elder Sun, don’t forget. If it wasn’t for our old master, would we have you? “Xiaoxue is the old master’s only heir. Aren’t you afraid that the old master will be disappointed underground by treating Xiaoxue like this?”Mother Tang said angrily. ”

“Hearing this, elder Sun was also angry. “Mrs. Tang, please don’t forget that Miss Tang Mi is also the old master’s Heir!” ”

“Compared to Tang Mi, Tang Xue was not just a little inferior. ”

“Hearing this, mother Tang was immediately stunned. ”

“She never dreamed that one day, Tang Mi’s little stutter would surpass Tang Xue. ”

“One had to know that when Old Master Tang was still alive, Tang Mi was a little girl who was inferior to Tang Xue in every way! ”

Old Master Tang simply did not take a liking to Tang Mi!

“In fact, even grandfather Tang didn’t expect that a granddaughter whom he had never taken a proper look at would be able to shoulder the responsibility of developing the Tang family. ”

“After saying this, elder sun continued, “Miss Tang Mi is so outstanding and has quite the demeanor of grandfather Tang. I believe that grandfather Tang will be very pleased when he realizes this!” ”

“After saying that, elder sun directly hung up the phone. ”

Mother Tang wished she could smash the phone right away!

Tang Mi was outstanding?

“If Tang Mi didn’t take advantage of ye Zao, she would still be serving tea and water at the CEN Group’s base. Tang Xue was the one who was truly capable. ”

At this moment.

Ding Dong —

The doorbell suddenly rang in the air.

Mother Tang took a deep breath and smiled as she went to open the door.

“She was Mrs. Tang. No matter what, she could not lose her poise. ”

“As soon as the door opened, she saw a few tall men in uniform standing outside. ”

“”Hello, is this Tang Xue’s Home?” ”

“Tang Xue had a wide network and often made friends with people from all walks of life. Tang only treated these people as Tang Xue’s friends. She smiled and said, “I’m Tang Xue’s mother. Are You Xiaoxue’s friends?” ”

“The Man Standing in front took out his documents and continued, “This is my police officer’s badge and arrest warrant. Ms. Tang Xue has committed serious violations of the law. Please ask her to come with us immediately.” ”

Violations of the law?

Tang Xue had violated the law?

“Mother Tang’s face turned pale. “Officers, you must have made a mistake! My daughter, Tang Xue, is well-behaved and sensible. Not only is she a doctor, but she’s also a high-ranking leader of the CEN base. She won’t do anything illegal!” ”

“”Don’t worry, the law is fair and just. We also pay attention to evidence when handling cases. If Tang Xue really did not do anything illegal, we will not falsely accuse her.”Without conclusive evidence, they would not rashly arrest her. ”

“Tang still shook her head. “No, that won’t happen! You must have made a mistake!” ”

“”Where’s Tang Xue?”The leading officer continued, “Please ask her to come out with us.” ”

“Mother Tang said, “I don’t know. I don’t know where she went.” ”

“The officer continued, “Covering up for a suspect is equivalent to committing a crime. Please think carefully before you say anything.” ”

There was no such thing as a favor in front of the law.

“Mother Tang was on the verge of collapse. She did not know why trouble would come knocking on her door one after another. At a time like this, covering up for Tang Xue was not an option. She could only tell the truth, “She’s sleeping in her room. Officer, please believe me. My daughter will not do anything illegal...” ”

“The officer interrupted mother Tang, “Please let Tang Xue come out for a moment.” ”

“”... I, I, I will go get her.” ”

The officer turned around and looked at the policewoman behind him. “Follow her for a moment.”

The policewoman nodded. “Okay.”

“When Tang Xue was woken up by Tang and saw the policewoman in the room, she was stunned. ”

Did she break the law?

What law did she break?

“At this moment, Tang Xue suddenly thought of the message she sent to William and the interactions she had with C nation during this period. Cold sweat broke out on her forehead almost immediately. ”

She had thought that Cen Shaoqing would not bother about these things with her.

She did not expect...

She did not expect these people from the inspection bureau to come looking for her.

Spies... treason...

These were not minor crimes.

What should she do?

What should she do now?

“Tang Xue had thought that after the aircraft carrier project ended, she would be a C citizen, so she did not think too much about it at that time. ”

“After all, after she became a C citizen, the laws of China would not be able to restrain her! ”

Who would have thought that ye Zao’s aircraft carrier plan would actually succeed!

Tang Xue’s strength seemed to have been sucked out at this moment. Her blood flowed backwards and she almost couldn’t breathe. She could only let a pair of cold handcuffs be cuffed to her wrist.

“Tang cried and asked, “Xiaoxue, Tell Mom, what exactly happened? Why did they say that you broke the law?” ”

“Tang Xue held her mother’s hand tightly and said in a hurried tone, “Mom, you must get me a lawyer! Get Me the best lawyer!” ”

“In a moment, Tang Xue was pulled away by a few people and brought into the police car. ”

“Tang ran out and shouted, “Xiaoxue, don’t worry, Mom will get you the best lawyer! Wait for Mom!” ” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Until the police car disappeared on the road ahead, Tang was still squatting on the ground and crying. ”

“At this moment, a voice came from the air. ”

Tang looked up and saw Tang Mi and Xiao Qing walking towards her while talking and laughing.

No.

She couldn’t let this mother and daughter pair see her as a joke!

Her pride and self-esteem didn’t allow them to see this.

Tang tried her best to control her emotions. She withdrew her tears and smiled. She stood up from the ground and walked into the house as if nothing had happened.

“Seeing Tang, Tang mi asked, “Mom, What’s wrong with Auntie? Should we go and take a look?” ”

“”Don’t go!”Xiao Qing continued, “Your Auntie has a weird temper. She doesn’t like others to laugh at her. The way she looked just now was because she didn’t want us to see her abnormality. If you go and look for her now, not only will she not appreciate your kindness, she will even think that you are deliberately looking at her as a joke!” ”

Xiao Qing had been Tang’s sister-in-law for more than ten years. He really knew her personality too well!

“Hearing this, Tang mi nodded. “Alright then!” ”

“After returning to the house, Tang Mi closed the door and burst into tears. ”

“After crying, she went to contact Tang Shengjun, who was on a business trip. ”

“When he found out that his daughter was in trouble, Tang Shengjun immediately rushed back from overseas overnight. ”

The next morning.

Monday.

Old Nie came to the base to work as usual.

“When he arrived at the department in the morning, he was informed by his colleagues that the Tang family’s laboratory had been disbanded. ”

Old Nie’s face turned pale.

“He already knew about the smooth lift-off of the aircraft carrier, but he didn’t expect that this matter would directly affect the Tang family’s laboratory! ”

“The laboratory has been disbanded. Then what about us?”Old Nie asked.

“His colleague shook his head and sighed. “How would I know! I’m really regretting it now. I shouldn’t have left Miss Ye’s aircraft carrier project team in the first place! Old Nie, do you regret it?” ”

“Of course, old Nie regretted it! ”

“He regretted it so much that his intestines turned green, especially when he saw Yu Zifei appear on television to be interviewed. ”

Yu Zifei was his disciple.

But what about him?

He wasn’t doing as well as Yu Zifei!

“If he hadn’t left the aircraft carrier project team, where would Yu Zifei have the chance to join? ”
