“A moment later, the assistant came into the hall. “Old Mr. Chen, I’m really sorry. Our husband is not available to see you right now.” ”

Not available?

Old Master Chen was stunned.

“Bai Jiayu was clearly at home, but he said that he was not available to see him! ”

How was this not available? This was clearly an excuse!

It was Bai Jiayu who did not want to see him at all.

“Old Master Chen looked up at the assistant and continued, “I wonder what Mr. Bai is busy with?” ”

“The assistant said, “Mr. Bai is handling official business.” ”

“After saying that, the assistant continued, “My husband has another message for you.” ”

“”Tell me about it,”old master Chen said. ”

“The assistant looked at Old Master Chen and hesitated for a moment before saying, “My husband said that we should let the juniors handle their own affairs. The seniors should act like seniors.” ”

He really had to act like an elder?

What did Bai Jiayu mean by this?

Was he mocking him for not acting like an elder?

“Old Master Chen had already lived for so long. No matter who saw him, they would all be respectful. But today, he was actually ridiculed by Bai Jiayu. ”

How could old master Chen endure this?

“Old Master Chen’s face was red from anger, but he still held back the anger in his heart. He did not let it out directly and continued, “What else did your master Bai Say?” ”

“The assistant continued, “Not for the time being.”. ”

“Old Master Chen looked at the assistant and continued, “Your Mr. Bai has nothing to say to me, but I have something to tell your Mr. Bai.” ”

“”Please speak,”the assistant said respectfully. ”

“Old Master Chen continued, “I want to give Mr. Bai an idiom.” ”

“At this point, Old Master Chen paused and continued, “A dog relies on its own strength.” ”

One sentence had two meanings.

The first meaning was that Bai Jiayu borrowed song Shiyu’s power.

“In the past, the Bai family had no right to criticize the Chen family. ”

The other meaning was that Bai Jiayu’s assistant relied on the power of others.

Old Master Chen was not afraid that Bai Jiayu would be angry.

“After all, it was Bai Jiayu who was rude first. ”

“Moreover, with the current status of the Chen family, there was no need to fear the Bai family. ”

“However, Old Master Chen had forgotten the most crucial point. ”

The Chen family’s achievements today were all because of this

“The assistant’s expression did not change. He said respectfully, “Alright, Old Master Chen. I will definitely pass the message to our master.” ”

Old Master Chen turned to look at the butler. “Let’s go.”

The Butler immediately pushed Old Master Chen Out.

The assistant looked at their backs and turned to walk towards the study.

“Bai Jiayu stood in front of the floor-to-ceiling window and looked at Old Master Bai’s figure. He then asked, “They left?” ”

“Yes.”The assistant nodded. “Yes.”

“After saying that, the assistant hesitated for a moment before continuing, “Old Master Chen said that he has a message for me to pass on to you.” ”

“What message?”Bai Jiayu asked with interest.

What message...

This really made it difficult for the assistant to speak.

“With that thought in mind, the assistant looked troubled. ”

Bai Jiayu turned to look at the assistant. “Tell me about it.”

“The assistant gulped. “He said, said... said that he has an idiom to pass on to you.” ”

“”Say it.”Bai Jiayu continued, “What idiom?” ”

“The assistant continued, “Dog, dog...” ”

The assistant could not say the next few words no matter how hard he tried.

Bai Jiayu’s temper could not be considered good.

Bai Jiayu laughed out loud. “A dog relies on others’Power?”

The assistant nodded. “Yes.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“He had thought that Bai Jiayu would be very angry, but unexpectedly, Bai Jiayu did not not get angry. Instead, he was smiling. ”

“”Sure, this idiom is used very well.” ”

“Old Master Chen’s idiom was indeed used correctly, but the target was not. ”

The Chen family was the real dog that relied on the power of others!

“If it was not for song Shiyu’s help, how would yun Jing still have the Chen family’s shadow? ”

The Chen family was getting worse with each generation!

“Now that they had offended song Shiyu, it looked like the Chen family was going to be in deep trouble this time. ”

The assistant looked at Bai Jiayu curiously. “You... You’re not angry?”

Bai Jiayu chuckled. “Why would I be angry?”

The assistant looked at Bai Jiayu but didn’t say anything.

Old Master Chen got into the car. He was still very angry. He looked up at the driver in the front seat. “Let’s go to Bai Yun residence.”

Bai Yun residence was song Shiyu’s residence.

“Old Master Chen had thought about it. He had to settle this matter within a short period of time. After all, Chen Siyao was still waiting for his good news. ”

“No matter what, he owed song Shiyu a favor. ”

He didn’t believe that song Shiyu could do anything to him!

Song Shiyu was doing his duty by helping him.
