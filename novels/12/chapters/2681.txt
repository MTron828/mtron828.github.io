It was obvious that ye Shu wasn’t someone who knew how to be grateful. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“If ye Shu had known how to repay kindness, things wouldn’t have ended up like this. ”

There was only about two thousand yuan in a red packet.

“Not to mention that ye Sui was ye Shu’s sister, just based on the fact that ye Sui had helped ye Shu before, Ye Shu shouldn’t have neglected ye Sui this much! ”

“The more Zhou Ziyue thought about it, the more she felt that something was wrong. She looked at ye Sui and continued, “Mom, why don’t We Leave?” ”

“Leave?”Ye Sui’s eyes were filled with surprise. “Why?”

She did not come all the way to the capital just to make a trip to the capital.

“Zhou ziyue continued, “It’s obvious that little aunt doesn’t treat you as her sister. There’s no need for us to look for trouble here.” ”

“”There’s only 2,000 yuan in a red packet. She thinks she’s trying to get rid of beggars!” ”

They would pay 800 Yuan for a ticket on the high-speed train to Beijing.

“It was 1,600 yuan for the two of them. ”

“What was the use of ye Shu giving them a red packet of 2,800 yuan? ”

“”Don’t worry,”ye Sui continued, “Let’s wait and see.” ”

She had all sorts of ways to make ye Shu bleed.

“”Mom, it’s obvious that their family looks down on us!”Zhou ziyue continued, “I can’t stand this injustice!” ”

“”How can we achieve great things if we don’t suffer?”Ye Sui continued, “Just wait! Soon, our family will be able to buy a villa in Beijing!” ”

“Ye Shu had already eaten meat, yet she was still not allowed to drink some soup? ”

What was a villa to ye Shu?

“Zhou ziyue shook her head, “I think you should stop Dreaming.” ”

“”Just wait and see!”Ye Sui continued, “Also, you and Feng Yang should be cut off! Don’t drag your feet, when that time comes, nothing will happen!” ”

“I know...”Zhou Ziyue said.

“”What else can you say besides saying that you know?”Ye Sui poked Zhou Ziyue’s forehead and continued, “Every time I say something, you won’t listen to me. You’ll be the one at a disadvantage!” ”

She really didn’t understand what was so good about Feng Yang that made Zhou Ziyue so loyal!

Zhou Ziyue didn’t say anything.

“From the beginning, she and Feng Yang weren’t playing around. She had already met Feng Yang’s parents. ”

“What she liked was not only Feng Yang, but also Feng Yang’s family. ”

“Feng Yang’s mother was a high school teacher, and his father was a middle school teacher. He could be considered to be from a scholarly family. Moreover, Feng Yang’s mother liked her very much. As long as she went, no matter how busy Feng Yang’s mother was, she would always prepare a big table of food. ”

The Little Sisters beside Zhou Ziyue were all very envious of Zhou Ziyue.

“Ye Sui did not want to say anything else, but he could not help but say, “Feng Yang, that poor boy, apart from giving you a stable life, he can’t give you anything else!” ”

A stable life.

These five words were a little stimulating to Zhou Ziyue.

She suddenly thought of her junior high school deskmate.

“Getting married, having children. ”

These six words were the current situation of Zhou Ziyue’s deskmate.

“Ye Sui continued, “Mother Feng Yang is still young. There are still more than ten years before she retires! “If you marry Feng Yang, once you have children, then you will be a complete housewife! “Once a woman deviates from society, then there will be no meaning to her existence!” ”

“At this point.., ye Sui continued, “Look at Bai Jingshu. After she marries into the Lin family, she’ll become a rich lady! She just had a full moon child, and she’s already hired two! Can the Feng family hire a wife for you? When the time comes, you’ll be a wife yourself! “If Feng Yang is an honest man, then forget it. But if Feng Yang were to cause any trouble outside, what would you do?” ”

“Hearing this, Zhou Ziyue bit her lips. ”

“Ye Sui continued, “Anyway, I’ve told you everything I need to say. Think it over yourself. Don’t blame me for not explaining myself to you!” ”

“”Mom, please stop talking!” ”

“Zhou Ziyue couldn’t take it anymore. Her heart was getting more and more panicked. She didn’t want to live like her deskmate, but she liked Feng Yang very much. ”

“Right now, she was feeling very conflicted and uncomfortable. ”

Ye Sui looked at Zhou Ziyue. “It’s up to you. I Can’t be bothered with you anymore!”

“After saying that, ye Sui added, “Right, whether you want to break up with Feng Yang or not, remember to build a good relationship with Bai Jingshu.” ”

She had observed that Bai Jingshu had quite a high status in the Lin family.

“Moreover, Lin Ze was the only boy in the Lin family. In the future, Bai Jingshu would be the mistress of the Lin family. If Zhou Ziyue could build a good relationship with Bai Jingshu, there would only be benefits and no harm. ”

“Okay.”Zhou Ziyue nodded.

On the other side.

In Lin Ze’s room.

“Bai Jingshu was carrying the child. As she fed her, she asked curiously, “What’s going on with second aunt? Didn’t you say that Grandma only has one daughter?” ”

“Lin Ze said, “She and my mom aren’t Biological Sisters.” ”

“Not Biological Sisters?”Bai Jingshu was even more curious. “Then what’s going on?”

“Lin Ze said, “She’s the older sister of Mom’s adoptive parents.” ”

“Bai Jingshu had heard about ye Shu before. She nodded and said, “I see. Her surname is ye too. I thought that she and mom were Biological Sisters!” ”

Lin Ze nodded. “The family that adopted mom back then had the surname Ye.”

“After saying that, Lin Ze seemed to have thought of something and continued, “That mother and daughter pair aren’t easy to deal with. Try not to interact with them too much.” ”

“Even though he hadn’t interacted with ye Sui much, Lin Ze could tell that ye Sui was definitely not a good person. ”

“The mother and daughter pair had to be aware of fame and fortune, especially when ye Sui asked Lin Ze to introduce a boyfriend to Zhou Ziyue. ”

Some people could tell the truth with just a few words.

Bai Jingshu was too naive. Lin Ze was afraid that she would be used by the two of them.

“Then why did mom take them in?”Bai Jingshu asked.

“Lin Ze continued, “It seems like mom and dad are returning her a favor.” ”

“Lin Ze didn’t want to interfere with the matters of the previous generation. Besides, it was a fact that ye Sui had helped ye Shu before. If he didn’t let ye Shu return the favor, Ye Shu wouldn’t feel at ease either. ”

“Bai Jingshu nodded. “Okay, I got it.” ”

“After saying that, Bai Jingshu continued, “How long will they stay here? I don’t think they want to go back anytime soon.” ”

Lin Ze frowned.

He had always hated dealing with such things.

“”I’ll Ask Mom Tomorrow,”Lin Ze said. ”

“You should.”

The next morning.

“Bai Jingshu was taking a stroll in the garden with the child in her arms. As she carried the child, she spoke to the child. “Tiezhu, Tiezhu, do you think the flowers in the garden are pretty?” ”

“Tiezhu was only a month old, so he had no idea what Bai Jingshu was talking about. He just stared at Bai Jingshu with wide eyes. ”

“At this moment, Little Tiezhu, who had been quiet, suddenly burst into tears. ”

“What’s wrong? What’s Wrong?”Bai Jingshu immediately carried the child and began to sway him. “Are You Hungry?”

The child did not drink the milk even after being fed. He was crying very hard.

“At this moment, a gentle female voice suddenly appeared by the side. “Let me do it.” ”

“Before Bai Jingshu could react, the child in her hand was carried away by someone. ”

“”Don’t Cry, Don’t cry. The baby doesn’t cry anymore.”The other party only coaxed the child a few times. The child, who was crying very hard, stopped crying instantly. ”

Bai Jingshu was extremely surprised. Only then did she realize that the person carrying the child was Zhou Ziyue.

“Ziyue.”

“Zhou Ziyue looked at Bai Jingshu with a smile and continued, “Newborns usually have intestinal cramps. If you carry him like this and Pat Him Gently, he won’t cry anymore.” ”

“Really?”Bai Jingshu asked.

“”Yeah.”Zhou ziyue smiled and said, “You try it.” ”

“Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded and reached out to take the baby.

“Zhou Ziyue guided her from the side. “Yes, yes, yes. This way, and then this way.” ”

“You Really Won’t cry anymore.”Bai Jingshu looked at Zhou Ziyue with joy in her eyes.
