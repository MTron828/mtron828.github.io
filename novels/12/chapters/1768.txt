“Soon, they arrived at the door of Cen Shaoqing’s office. ”

Special Assistant Zuo was standing at the door and talking to a young woman.

“Seeing ye Zao Come Over, special assistant zuo immediately said, “Miss Ye.” ”

Ye Zao nodded slightly and pushed the door open to enter.

“Seeing this, the young woman asked curiously, “Why can she enter but I can’t? They’re both women, and you still want to be special?” ”

“”Do you know who that is? Miss Ye!”Special assistant zuo continued, “Can you compare to miss ye?” ”

“The young woman said in surprise, “Is She Dr. YC?” ”

“Yes.”Special Assistant Zuo nodded.

“The young woman let out a long sigh. “That really can’t be compared! Here, take the document!” ”

Special Assistant Zuo took the document.

The young woman turned around and left.

Cen Shaoqing’s office was very quiet. A single song was playing in the air.

“At this moment, Cen Shaoqing was making tea. ”

“He sat in front of the tea table and stared intently at the tea set. The curling smoke of the tea made his face faintly discernible, and the noble room was shrouded in coldness. ”

“As the sound of footsteps approached, Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly. ”

“He hated it the most when his assistant or secretary came in and out of his office casually. Just as he was about to scold him, he raised his head and saw Ye Zhuo. He immediately stood up from his chair. “Leader, you’re here.” ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and walked over to sit opposite Cen Shaoqing. “I came to ask you something.”

“What is it?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

Ye Zhuo took out his phone and pointed at the news content on it. “Is this your doing?”

“”Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and poured a cup of tea for Ye Zhuo. “Leader, drink some tea to moisten your throat.” ”

Ye Zhuo took the Teacup. “I knew it was you.”

“I plan to help Dansen get to the top. What do you think?”Cen Shaoqing continued to ask.

“Kala was the pillar of C Nation’s scientific research world. Now that this pillar had fallen, they definitely needed to find someone to replace it. ”

Dansen was a very good candidate.

“Who is Dansen?”Ye Zao asked.

Cen Shaoqing handed a document to ye Zao. “Take a look.”

Ye Zhuo took the document and flipped through two pages.

“Dansen had been an orphan since he was young. He was also a spy carefully groomed by Cen Shaoqing. All these years, he had been sending information to the base. ”

“After reading through Dansen’s information, Ye Zhuo said, “This person is indeed not bad. I just don’t know if he can pass the election.” ”

The position of Dr. Cara was not so easy to take.

He had to go through many tests.

Cen Shaoqing curled his lips slightly. “You don’t have to worry about that.”

“Ye Zao took a sip of tea and continued, “Right, who did you send over? Will the International Department find out?” ”

“Find out?”Cen Shaoqing chuckled. “Just based on that bunch of trash from the International Department?”

He looked a little arrogant.

“However, he did not look out of place at all. ”

It was as if he was supposed to

“Seeing him like this, ye Zao felt relieved and continued, “Is there any food in the fridge?” ”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing stood up. “What do you want to eat? I’ll go get it for you.”

Ye Zao didn’t stand on ceremony with her. “Doughnut chocolate.”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Ever since he had confirmed his relationship with ye Zao, Cen Shaoqing’s refrigerator in every office had all kinds of desserts in it. ”

“Soon, CEN Shaoqing came over with donuts and chocolate. ”

Ye Zhuo liked to eat chocolate while drinking tea.

“There was a hint of sweetness in the bitterness of chocolate, and a hint of fragrance in the bitterness of tea. The two flavors blended together and made people feel comfortable. ”

“After drinking the tea and eating the chocolate, it was already two o’clock in the afternoon. Ye Zhuo received a wechat message from ye Shu. “My mom sent me a wechat message. She said that there will be a family gathering tonight. Do you want to go back with me?” ”

“Sure.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

He couldn’t miss anything. He couldn’t miss such a big family gathering.

“After work that night, Cen Shaoqing went to ye Zhuo’s office to wait for her. ”

“After ye Zhuo was done with his work, he walked to Cen Shaoqing’s side and handed him the wine-red coat. “Hold it for me.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing took the coat, and Ye Zhuo handed him the backpack. “And this.” ”

“After saying that, ye Zhuo continued, “Wait for me outside. I’ll go into the lab and come out right away.” ”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing took ye Zhuo’s things and walked out of the door.

“Along the way, everyone looked curiously at Cen Shaoqing. ”

“Although everyone had long been used to Cen Shaoqing and ye Zhuo being boyfriend and girlfriend, they were still very surprised to see Cen Shaoqing holding ye Zhuo’s clothes and bag like a porter. ”
