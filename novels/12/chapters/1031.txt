Chapter 1032: 227: Mother and daughter recognize each other and disqualify XI Weiyue from inheriting! 6

Translator: 549690339

Xi Weiyue narrowed her eyes when she heard this.

It seemed like her intuition was not wrong.

This Miss Zhao was indeed not some small fry.

“”Then, chairman Si, are you taking me to see Miss Zhao Now?” ”

“The lawyer nodded. “Yes. Miss XI, please follow me this way.” ”

Zhao Xueyin’s office was on the southeast side of the 58th floor.

“Soon, the lawyer brought Xi Weiyue to Zhao Xueyin’s office and knocked on the door. ”

Knock Knock Knock —

“About ten seconds later, a beautiful female voice came from inside. “Come in.” ”

“”Miss XI, come in with me.” ”

Xi Weiyue nodded and followed the lawyer’s footsteps.

“The moment she entered, she saw a young woman sitting in front of a mahogany desk, processing documents. When the lawyer spoke, she slowly raised her head and looked at the two of them. ” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“”Miss Zhao, this is the heir that Aunt Lang recommended, Xi Weiyue, Miss XI.” ”

“Miss XI.”Zhao Xueyin put down the pen in her hand and looked up at Xi Weiyue.

Xi Weiyue was stunned.

She had thought that Zhao Xueyin was just an ordinary girl.

“However, whether it was her appearance, her doubts, or her temperament, they were all beyond her imagination. ”

“Zhao Xueyin had a standard oval face, Moe eyebrows, and white teeth. She wore a snow-white dress, and she was as beautiful and generous as a fairy standing in the clouds. ”

There was also a layer of dignity around her.

“Seeing Zhao Xueyin like this, Xi Weiyue instantly felt ashamed of her inferiority. ”

“But at this time, Xi Weiyue obviously could not be timid. ”

She had to stand tall.

“According to her rank, she was much higher than Zhao Xueyin. ”

“Grandfather ye alone accounted for 60% of the shares of the Shunxi Financial Group, while the Zhao family only accounted for 25% . ”

“Thinking of this, Xi Weiyue raised her chin and looked at Zhao Xueyin. She said in a neither servile nor overbearing manner, “Miss Zhao.” ”

“Xi Weiyue thought that she had concealed her emotions well, but she was still seen through by Zhao Xueyin with a single glance. ”

Zhao Xueyin’s eyes were filled with a layer of ridicule.

“After all, she was born into a small family. Even if she was plated with a layer of gold, it would not be able to conceal the aura of a downtrodden person on her body. ”

Difficult!

“Zhao Xueyin’s expression did not change. She nodded lightly and looked at si lui, “Brother Si, take Miss XI to familiarize herself with the working environment of our consortium first. Then, the reception team on the first floor is still short of one person. First, arrange for Miss XI to go to the reception team.” ”

Reception team?

Xi Weiyue frowned slightly.

“She was, after all, grandfather Ye’s heir. Zhao Xueyin actually arranged for her to go to the reception team! ”

What a joke!

“Zhao Xueyin seemed to have seen the look in Xi Weiyue’s eyes, then, she said, “Miss XI, you’ve just arrived at the consortium. To prevent people from gossiping about you, you’d better start from the most basic level. Otherwise, you won’t be able to convince the public! “Don’t look down on the reception group. Although the work of the reception group looks simple, in fact, there’s a lot more to it!” ”

“What if I don’t go?”Xi Weiyue sat directly opposite Zhao Xueyin.

Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes.

“XI weiyue said bluntly, “Miss Zhao, my grandfather is the largest shareholder of the consortium. I think you should know how much shares your Zhao family has, right? !” ”

“Not only was Zhao Xueyin not angry, she was smiling instead. “It’s indeed my inconsiderate consideration! Then, Miss XI, which department do you want to go to?” ”

“At this moment, a rapid ringtone sounded in the air. ”

“Zhao Xueyin picked up the phone. “Okay, I got it.” ”

“After hanging up, Zhao Xueyin looked at the lawyer. “Brother Si, please take the unimportant people out.” ”

The lawyer was stunned.

“Other than him and Zhao Xueyin, there was no one else in this office. ”

Could it be...

The person Zhao Xueyin was talking about was Xi Weiyue?

“Xi Weiyue reacted at this moment and said angrily, “Zhao Xueyin, who are you calling an insignificant person?” ”

“Zhao Xueyin looked at Xi Weiyue and said word by word, “Miss XI, I’m officially announcing that your identity as the heir has been revoked!” ”
