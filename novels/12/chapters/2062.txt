Translator: 549690339

“Zhao Dan immediately walked forward and asked, “Hello, May I ask if Miss Ye is still in a meeting?” ”

“Xiao Fen said, “Yes, Madam. Is there something urgent you need to speak to miss ye about?” ”

“”There’s nothing urgent,”Zhao Dan continued, “May I ask when Miss Ye will be able to finish her work?” ”

The assistant smiled and shook his head. “I’m not too sure about that either.”

“With that, the assistant continued, “Madam, if you have something urgent, I can help you pass on the message to Miss Ye.” ”

“”It’s fine. There’s no need to trouble yourself,”Zhao Dan said. ” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“The assistant nodded and continued, “Madam, if there’s nothing else, I’ll go over to do my work first.” ”

“”En, you go ahead,”Zhao Dan continued. ”

The assistant turned around and walked out of the door.

“Zhao Dan looked at the back of his assistant, his expression a little ugly. ”

What kind of meeting was it that required such a long time? It was clearly because ye Zhuo did not want to see her.

No upbringing meant no upbringing.

“Even if she was standing at the top of changyue, she still could not change her habits. She could not compare to her star. ”

“Zhao Dan suppressed the anger in his heart and walked out. When he reached the door, he saw ye Han. ”

“Ye Han walked over. “Madam, are you leaving?” ”

“There was not a trace of anger on Zhao Dan’s face. Instead, it was filled with a smile. He continued, “Miss ye is really a busy person. I Won’t disturb her. I’ll visit her another day!” ”

“I’ll send madam off.”Ye Han followed Zhao Dan’s footsteps.

“Zhao Dan said, “Mr. Xiao Ye, you don’t have to be so polite.” ”

“”Madam is an honored guest. It’s only right for me to send her off.”Ye Han continued, “My sister is really too busy to get away. Otherwise, she should have been the one to send you off.” ”

“”Mr. Xiao Ye, you’re too kind,”Zhao Dan said. ”

“After sending Zhao Dan onto the aircraft, ye Han continued, “I hope madam can forgive me for my inconsiderate hospitality.” ”

“”Miss, sir, what are you talking about!”Zhao dan smiled and said, “Help me to tell Miss ye that I left without saying goodbye today. Tell her not to take offense and come back another day.” ”

“Ye Han nodded. “Alright, I’ll definitely bring Madam’s words.” ”

“Watching as the aircraft gradually moved away from his sight, ye Han retracted his gaze and walked back. ”

“Inside the aircraft, Zhao Dan was a little angry and immediately contacted man Jiangshan. ”

“When he heard this, man Jiangshan smiled and said, “What’s there to be angry about with your own daughter? Besides, it’s normal for her to be angry. After all, we’ve lost her for so many years.” ”

“Even a clay figurine had a third of a temper, let alone a human? ”

“When he heard this, Zhao Dan’s anger subsided a little and he continued, “I understand this logic too, but she should never, never, never, never, never, never, never have any manners! If it were Xing ‘er, she definitely wouldn’t be like this!” ”

“Man Xing had been raised well since she was young, and she had grown up even more beautifully. ”

What did it mean to be both talented and beautiful?

Man Xing was truly talented and beautiful.

“As for Ye Zhuo, he could only look at that face. He had no upbringing at all. ”

“Zhao Dan was originally filled with guilt towards her eldest daughter. After all, it was their parents who had let down this daughter. However, after today, she no longer felt any guilt towards ye Zhuo. ”

This was because ye Zao simply did not deserve her guilt.

“She originally thought that her eldest daughter was like Manxing, obedient, sensible, and understanding. However, things were not like this at all. ”

Zhao Dan was even starting to wonder how ye Zao had gotten to that position.

Was it a shortcut?

“In short, if it was Manxing, she would definitely welcome her warmly today. ”

“After all, they did not intentionally lose her back then. ”

“As a parent, who would watch their child become a vagrant? ”

“However, when Zhao Dan saw the five-year-old little full moon from the remote monitor, she cried her eyes out. After all, that was her daughter who had been pregnant for ten months! ”

She wanted to rush over and pick up the child.

But she couldn’t.

She had to be responsible for the people of Manxing.

“From then on, Zhao Dan cut off all contact with the little full moon. ”

“Because she was afraid that if she took one more look, her heart would soften. ”

“Therefore, during the ten years of service, she had never seen the full moon again until this election. ”

She even thought that the full moon had died.

“Who would have thought that not only did she not die, but she was also alive and well, and had become the ruler of changyue. ”

“But thinking about it, it made sense. ”

“After all, she was the daughter of her and man Jiangshan. ”

“Like father, like son. ”

It was all because of their good genes.

“Man Jiangshan continued, “No one is perfect. Not everyone is like our Xing ‘er.” ”

“”You’re right.”Zhao Dan sighed. “Indeed, not everyone can be compared to our Xing ‘er.” ”
