“Uncle fu smiled and said, “Are you really not leaving?” ”

“I’m really not leaving.”Si lui nodded very seriously.

“”It’s good that you’re not leaving.”Uncle Fu continued, “Young Master, you have no idea how much the old master has been looking forward to your return all these years!” ”

Old Master Jin scratched his hair in embarrassment.

Zhao family.

“After a long time, Zhao Xueyin finally calmed down and went upstairs to apologize to Father Zhao. ”

“”Dad, I’m sorry. I was too impulsive this afternoon. I shouldn’t have treated you like that.” ”

“Father Zhao sighed and did not directly answer Zhao Xueyin’s words. Instead, he said, “I’ve already gotten people to suppress the popularity of the photo. The chief election is in a few days. How are your preparations?” ”

Preparations?

“Originally, Zhao Xueyin had already made all the necessary preparations. ”

“Currently, half of the board of directors supported her. ”

And more than half supported ye Zao.

“Once her relationship with master five was confirmed and the two large financial groups joined hands, would those people still dare not support her? ”

But now...

All of their efforts were in vain.

Zhao Xueyin pinched her fingers and did not say anything.

“Two months ago, she was still determined to get the chief seat. ”

She did not know when it started.

It had become like this.

“A moment later, Zhao Xueyin continued, “Currently, the most difficult person to deal with is Han Laoshan. As long as Han Laoshan is on my side, there won’t be any problems.” ”

Han Laoshan had followed old master ye all the way here. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Actually, at the beginning, Han Laoshan did not support ye Zhuo. ”

Later on.

“Under ye Zhuo’s bewitchment, Han Laoshan also defected. ”

“Following Han Laoshan’s defection, the remaining large group of people also defected. ”

Therefore.

This chief election was very disadvantageous to her!

“Thinking of this, Zhao Xueyin frowned deeply. ”

Father Zhao looked at Zhao Xueyin and stood up. “Come with me.”

Zhao Xueyin followed Father Zhao’s footsteps.

The two of them arrived at the study.

Father Zhao took out a document and handed it to Zhao Xueyin.

“What’s This?”Zhao Xueyin asked curiously.

“Father Zhao continued, “Open it and take a look.” ”

“Zhao Xueyin opened the document bag and after seeing what was inside, the desolate expression on her face instantly turned into joy. “Dad! How did you know about this?” ”

“With this, why would she be afraid that Han Laoshan would not support her? ”

“Father Zhao lit a cigarette. “I’ve told you before that as a person, you have to leave a way out for yourself, but you never listen to me! If the lawyer was here, he would definitely be a capable assistant!” ”

Zhao Xueyin remained silent.

In the teahouse.

Zhao Xueyin sat by the window and kept looking out.

At this moment.

An old man with white hair and a thin figure walked over.

“When she saw who it was, Zhao Xueyin immediately stood up from her chair. “Uncle Han.” ”

That’s right.

The person who came was Han Luoshan.

“Xueyin.”

“”Uncle Han, please take a seat.”Zhao Xueyin poured a cup of tea for Han Luoshan. ”

Han Luoshan sat opposite Zhao Xueyin.

“Zhao Xueyin continued, “Uncle Han, I’m really sorry for calling you out on such a cold day. Oh right, is Big Brother Han feeling better?” ”

“Han Laoshan was stunned when he heard this. He looked up at Zhao Xueyin, “You, you, how did you know?” ”

“Han Laoshan and his wife had an only son, Han Dongliang. ”

He was thirty-six years old this year.

He was unmarried.

“Half a year ago, Han Dongliang suddenly became unable to speak due to a common cold. He was bedridden. ”

“Until now, Han Dongliang was still lying in bed, unable to take care of himself. He was in critical condition. ”

“But the news that Han Dongliang was sick, the Han family did not disclose it to the public. ”

How did Zhao Xueyin Know?
