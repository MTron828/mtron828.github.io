Translator: 549690339

Soon!

“Things were progressing along the path of her previous life. Soon, Ye Zao would become song Shiyu’s guinea pig. ”

Ye Zao would die a very pitiful death!

Ye Zao would die without a complete corpse just like her in her previous life!

“Thinking of this, Mu Yourong felt extremely comfortable. ”

She was waiting for the day when ye Zao would be tortured by Song Shiyu.

...

At the CEN residence.

Old Madam Cen was chatting with Zhou Xiang.

“”Xiang Xiang, do you think there was any progress between Shaoqing and Yezi on the island last time?” ”

Zhou Xiang nodded. “I think there was.”

“Hearing this, the corners of old Madam Cen’s mouth curled up into a smile. She continued, “Do you think there were any scenes that were inappropriate for children when they were alone?” ”

“Zhou Xiang was a little speechless. “Mom, what are you thinking about? Our Shaoqing is a gentleman. He can’t do those things.” ”

“As a mother, Zhou Xiang knew Shaoqing too well. ”

“If he had any other thoughts, he wouldn’t still be a virgin until now. ”

“”You don’t understand this, do you?”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Don’t look at some people who appear to be pure-hearted and unlustful. They don’t care about anything. Once they are enlightened, they will be full of evil thoughts! I know the men of the Cen family too well! Back then, your father-in-law was also so gentle and refined. In fact, in the mainland, he was very evil! “Don’t tell me that your man didn’t have any fancy tricks back then. He was especially well-behaved!” ”

“If he was really well-behaved, he wouldn’t have had five children in one go. ”

“Zhou Xiang’s face blushed suspiciously. “Mom, what are you talking about!” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen said speechlessly, “Look at you, why are you blushing! You’re Not a big girl!” ”

“Just then, Cen Shaoqing walked in from outside. ”

The mother-in-law and daughter-in-law immediately stopped the topic. Zhou Xiang opened the lid of the incense burner and was ready to change to a stick of sandalwood.

“”Mom, Grandma.”Cen Shaoqing took the initiative to greet the two of them. ”

“Zhou Xiang held the sandalwood in his hand. “Shaoqing, lend me your lighter.” ”

“I don’t have a lighter.”

“Where’s your lighter?”Zhou Xiang asked.

“CEN Shaoqing said concisely, “I threw it away.” ”

“Zhou Xiang said in surprise, “Why did you throw it away? Don’t you smoke anymore?” ”

“I quit.”Cen Shaoqing’s tone was indifferent.

“You quit smoking?”Zhou Xiang asked in disbelief.

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“This time, even old Mrs. Cen was stunned. ”

Cen Shaoqing had been smoking for more than ten years.

He quit just like that?

“Why did you quit smoking?”Zhou Xiang asked.

“CEN Shaoqing said, “Because smoking is not good for the body.” ”

Zhou Xiang and old Mrs. Cen looked at each other.

They could see the doubt in each other’s eyes.

They had told Cen Shaoqing countless times that smoking was harmful to health.

But Cen Shaoqing had never listened to them seriously. He had been smoking for ten years.

Why did he suddenly stop smoking now?

There must be something fishy going on!

There must be something fishy going on!

“”Shaoqing, why did you suddenly stop smoking? Did Something Happen?”Zhou Xiang asked. ”

“Nothing.”Cen Shaoqing walked upstairs.

“Zhou Xiang turned to look at Old Mrs. Cen. “Mom, do you think this is strange?” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen nodded. “Xiang Xiang, do you think it’s possible that Yezi doesn’t like smoking, so Shaoqing gave up smoking?” ”

“Zhou Xiang frowned. “I don’t think so. Shaoqing doesn’t know that he has fallen in love with searing. He can’t even be bothered to listen to us. Would he listen to Searing’s Words? It should be impossible, right?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing had yet to face his feelings, so how could he listen to Ye Zao’s words. ”

“Moreover, from Zhou Xiang’s point of view, Cen Shaoqing was a very chauvinistic person. He would not listen to the words of a little girl. This was not in line with his style. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “That may not be the case. What if this is really the work of Yezi? After all, Yezi is so outstanding. If that Brat doesn’t coax Yezi, what if Yezi doesn’t want him?” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen was an optimist. No matter what, she liked to think in a positive direction. ”

“Zhou Xiang said, “I hope it’s what you think, but I think the possibility is too small! It’s also possible that Shaoqing himself realized that smoking is bad, so he didn’t smoke!” ”

...

On the other side.

Ye Sen thought for a long time and finally decided to confess to Bai Wei.

He felt that Bai Wei was the girl he was looking for.

Ye Sen bought a bunch of roses and planned to confess his love to Bai Wei at dinner tonight.

“That night, Ye Sen specially came to the restaurant 20 minutes earlier and prepared everything in advance. ”

“At eight o’clock, Bai Wei arrived as promised. ”

“Bai Wei was still the same as before. In order to maintain her figure, she only ordered a vegetable salad. ”

“Ye Sen looked at Bai Wei. “Bai Wei, I have something to tell you.” ”

“Go ahead.”Bai Wei took out a tissue and wiped her mouth elegantly.

“Ye Sen mustered his courage. “Bai Wei, I know what I’m going to say next might be a little abrupt, but I swear, I mean it from the bottom of my heart!” ”

A smug look flashed across Bai Wei’s eyes.

“Ye Sen was going to confess to her, wasn’t he? ”

That was great!

“Ye Sen continued, “Bai Wei, I like you! I hope you can be my girlfriend.”Speaking up to this point, Ye Sen took out the roses that he had hidden earlier. ”

“Bai Wei pretended to be very surprised. “Ye Sen, you?” ”

“”Bai Wei, I really like you!”Ye Sen handed the roses to her. ”

“I. . .”Bai Wei hesitated.

Ye Sen looked at Bai Wei with pleading eyes.

“After a long while, Bai Wei took the rose. “Then let’s... Try.” ”

“”Really?”Ye Sen was overjoyed. “Bai Wei, you accept me?” ”

“Bai Wei nodded and continued, “Have you told your sister about us? Will she not like me?” ”

“”No!”Ye Sen said, “My sister is a very good person! She will definitely like you! You will know when you see her!” ”

Bai Wei looked at ye Sen. “When are you going to take me to see your sister?”
