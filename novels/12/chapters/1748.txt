“Auntie Wu finally reacted and said with a smile, “So the eldest miss is back! Please come in, the old lady hasn’t woken up yet.” ”

Feng Ying nodded and went in with Auntie Wu.

“Yang Ting was sitting in the dining room eating breakfast. When she saw Auntie Wu come back with a person, she asked curiously, “Mom, is there a guest in the house?” ”

“”What nonsense are you spouting! This is the old lady’s granddaughter!”After saying that, she looked at Feng Ying with a smile. “Miss, please don’t mind her. This is my daughter, Yang Ting!” ”

Yang Ting was completely dumbfounded!

Didn’t they say that the old lady’s granddaughter was overseas?

Why was she back?

Why was she back at this time?

Was she back to snatch the property?

Feng Ying frowned slightly. “Why do I feel that the two of you treat this place as your own home?”

“”No, no!”Auntie Wu quickly explained, “Miss, you’ve misunderstood. We have no such intention! It’s the old lady who is afraid of the dark and loneliness. That’s why she asked the three of us to move in and live with her! “If you don’t like it, we’ll move out immediately!” ”

“Feng Ying continued, “I’ll come back to accompany Grandma in the future and be filial to her. You guys should move back quickly!” ”

The Feng family’s villa was not for the servants to live in!

“Feng Ying was the old lady’s granddaughter and the owner of the family. At this moment, even if Auntie Wu was unwilling, she could only nod her head. “Alright, eldest miss, I understand. Don’t worry, we will move out immediately.” ”

“Yang Ting stood at the side, feeling extremely uncomfortable. She had thought that she would be able to turn things around this time and become the eldest miss of a rich family! ”

Who would have thought!

Who would have thought that Cheng Yaojin would suddenly appear out of nowhere.

“This Feng Ying was really shameless. Usually, she did not come out to show filial piety. Seeing that the old woman was about to die, she came out to fight for the family property! ”

Wasn’t it disgusting? Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“”Move out today!”Feng Ying’s face was stern as she sized up Wu Sao and her daughter, “Don’t think that I don’t know what you are thinking! A servant is a servant, and you want to become a Phoenix on the branch? You’re daydreaming! You don’t even have the slightest self-awareness! “My Grandmother has me, her biological granddaughter. No one can take advantage of this!” ”

“”Miss, don’t worry. I’ll move out today!” ”

Feng Ying glanced at Auntie Wu and turned to walk upstairs.

“Looking at Feng Ying’s back leaving, Yang Ting was extremely uncomfortable. She walked to Auntie Wu’s side and said, “Mom! What should we do now? Are We really going to move out?”The fat that was in her mouth was snatched away just like that, yang Ting was really unwilling! ”

“”If we don’t move, can we still stay here?”Auntie Wu’s face was also filled with depression. She continued, “Quickly go and greet your father! Let him be mentally prepared!” ”

Yang Ting nodded and could only nod.

Her mother was right. This was the Feng family. They couldn’t just stay here!

Feng Ying came to the third floor and knocked on the door.

“Perhaps she didn’t expect someone to come so early, but no one answered for a long time. ”

It wasn’t until Feng Ying found the key and was ready to open the door that the door opened from the inside.

“It had been decades since they last met. The old lady seemed to have aged a lot. If she hadn’t grown up in front of the old lady, Feng Ying wouldn’t dare to recognize her. ”

She couldn’t believe that this was the grandmother who had raised her since she was young.

“”Grandma, Grandma,”Feng Ying said with a choked voice. ”

“Looking at Feng Ying who was standing in front of her, the old lady was a little stunned. “You, you, you are Xiao Ying?” ”

“”It’s me! Grandma, I’m Xiao Ying!”Feng Ying cried out in pain, she hugged the old lady. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, Grandma. I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have not come back to see you for so long! Grandma, I’m Sorry!” ”

The scene of the grandfather and grandson meeting was a little touching.

The old lady’s face was also full of tears.

“”It’s good that you’re back. It’s good that you’re back.”After a long while, the old lady finally controlled her emotions and continued, “Xiao Ying, you’re not going to C country this time, right?” ”

Not going to C Country?

How could that be!

“Feng Ying continued, “Grandma, I came back to take you there to enjoy life together. My mother has left, and you’re the only family I have now!” ”

“Hearing this, the old lady’s expression immediately changed. ”

“”So, you are going back to C Nation?” ”

“Feng Ying nodded. “Grandma, don’t worry. I Won’t leave you alone this time. I will take you back with me.” ”

“You can go.”The old lady withdrew her hand. “Just pretend that I never had a granddaughter like you!”

“Seeing this, Feng Ying was stunned. She thought that Feng Qi’s saying that the old lady didn’t want to go to C country was just an excuse. She didn’t expect that the old lady really didn’t want to go! ”
