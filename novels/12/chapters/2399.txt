“Fifth Master.”Someone called out in the air.

“The others also turned around at this time. As expected, they saw Cen Shaoqing walking over and greeted him respectfully. ”

“He was wearing his lab coat as he walked into the laboratory. In a low voice, he asked, “Is Miss ye inside?” ”

“Miss Ye is.”

Cen Shaoqing did not say anything else and continued walking inside.

“When everything was almost done, ye Zao realized that Cen Shaoqing had arrived. He took off his mask and asked in surprise, “When did you come?” ”

“”It’s been almost three hours,”cen shaoqing continued, “I saw that you were in a good state, so I didn’t call you.” ”

“This was ye Zao’s charm. As soon as she entered the laboratory, she would immediately enter a good state. No one could influence her. ”

“Ye Zao continued, “Now that we’re almost done with our work, shall we go out and eat something?” ”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and followed ye Zao’s footsteps.

“Although it was only a temporary base, a rest room had been built. ”

“At this time, there were already many people sitting in the lounge eating. ”

Ye Zhuo sat on the chair and waited for CEN Shaoqing to get the food.

“From Ye Zhuo’s angle, he could just see Cen Shaoqing queuing up. ”

“He did not use his privilege. Instead, like everyone else, he queued up to get the food. ”

“However, his aura was strong. Even though he was hidden in the crowd, people could still see him at a glance. ”

“After waiting for about ten minutes, CEN Shaoqing walked over with food in his hands. “There’s no more pickled fish. I’ve ordered a super spicy red blood curd.” ”

“Recently, Ye Zao had been especially obsessed with pickled fish. Whenever he went to eat, he would order pickled fish. ”

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

Cen Shaoqing placed the food on the table one by one.

“Because they were all small portions, CEN Shaoqing ordered a variety of dishes. ”

“There were hairy blood curd, cold-mixed fern root powder, fried chicken, mapo tofu, and so on. ”

There were also two desserts.

“Ye Zhuo took out disposable chopsticks and continued, “When did you know that I was coming?” ”

“You still have the nerve to say that? Why didn’t you tell me that you were coming to Lzhou?”Cen Shaoqing raised his eyebrows slightly.

“Indeed, Ye Zhuo did not have the time to inform Cen Shaoqing. He touched his nose guiltily and said, “I saw that you were quite busy.” ”

Cen Shaoqing picked up his cup and took a sip of water. “It’s alright. I’ve already finished what I needed to do.”

He had originally planned to prepare a proposal after he was done with what he was doing. Who knew that such a thing would happen halfway through.

His plans could not keep up with the changes.

“At the thought of this, Cen Shaoqing’s eyes dimmed and he continued to drink. ”

Why was it so difficult for him to get his hands on a beauty?

“Ye Zhuo picked up a piece of fresh duck blood and placed it in Cen Shaoqing’s bowl. He then said, “The duck blood cooked by the chef is very delicious. You should try it too.” ”

Duck Blood?

“Cen Shaoqing instinctively resisted, but he still picked it up and tasted it. ”

“Ever since he got together with Ye Zhuo, he had started to eat almost everything. ”

“The taste was not as bad as he had imagined. It was very similar to tofu, but it was much more tender and smooth than tofu. ”

“Is it good?”Ye Zhuo asked.

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “It’s not bad.”

“After the defensive line was established, Ye Zhuo had the international department issue a statement. ”

“From today onwards, if the people of L continent wanted to leave the island, they could take a boat and leave immediately. When the strange beasts of L continent reached a point where they could no longer control them, they would seal off the exit. ”

“After this statement was issued, it immediately caused a huge uproar in L continent. ”

People wanted to flee the island.

“Of course, most people said that they believed in Mario and wanted to work with L continent. ”

“So, 100,000 people left L continent that day. ”

“Mario thought that the people of l continent would believe him unconditionally. When he saw that nearly two-thirds of the people left the island, it would be a lie to say that he didn’t feel anything. ”

“However, he wasn’t too sad. ”

“One day, these people would know that his choice wasn’t wrong. ”

There was always speculation behind success.

Mario stood up from his office chair and walked towards the laboratory.

“Just as he arrived at the laboratory, he heard a roar. ”

Mario didn’t find it strange and continued to walk in.

He saw that the three exotic beasts that were only the size of birds a few days ago were now the size of elephants.

“Because they had three heads, they looked extremely terrifying. ”

“Hearing Mario’s footsteps, the exotic beast immediately turned around and knelt down on one knee with its head lowered. Like a pet dog, it begged Mario to pet it. ”
