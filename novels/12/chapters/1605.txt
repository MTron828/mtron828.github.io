“”Unless the aircraft carrier project team is disbanded, otherwise, I will never leave this world!”Tang mi’s attitude was firm. ”

Xiao Qing frowned and turned to look at Tang Shengli. “Look! Look! This is the good daughter you’ve Spoiled!”

“Our daughter isn’t wrong! How do we know that the aircraft carrier project won’t work if we don’t try!”Tang Shengli said.

“This is outrageous!”Xiao Qing grabbed Tang Shengli’s ear. “What did you say just now? Who Isn’t wrong?”

“Tang Mi was still young, so it was fine if she wasn’t sensible. However, she didn’t expect Tang Shengli to be insensible as well. ”

“Tang Shengli waved Xiao Qing’s hand away, then, he said, “Her mother, I can let you make the decisions about other things in the family! But this is the only thing that can’t be done! So what if her daughter joins the aircraft carrier project team? Young people should have ideals and aspirations! So what if they fail? At least her daughter has once worked hard and strived for her ideals!” ”

“After saying that, Tang Shengli looked at Tang Mi. “Daughter, don’t listen to your mother’s nonsense! I support you! I also believe in You and Miss Ye!” ”

Tang mi looked at Tang Shengli in disbelief. “Dad! Do you really support me?”

Tang shengli patted his chest. “Of course! When have I ever lied to you? Go Chase your dreams! Mom and dad will never hold you back!”

“”Thank you, Dad!”Tang Xue hugged Tang Shengli excitedly. ”

“Tang shengli smiled and said, “This child!” ”

“”Tang Shengli!”Looking at the father and daughter who looked like a pair of clowns, Xiao Qing was extremely angry. “Are you crazy? Do you know what you’re talking about?” ”

“”I’m Not Crazy!”Tang Shengli looked at Xiao Qing. “In short, you don’t have to care about this matter. I support my daughter!” ”

“”Thank You, Dad! Dad Is So Nice!”Tang Mi was so happy. She thought that she wouldn’t be able to get past her parents, but she didn’t expect Tang Shengli to support her so much. ”

Xiao Qing massaged her temples. “Tang Shengli!”

“”Honey, don’t be angry!”Tang Shengli walked over and supported Xiao Qing. He continued, “It’s right for young people to pursue their dreams! Didn’t the books say that a life without dreams is just a salted fish!” ”

“Is that her dream? That’s her dream! Daydreaming! Impossible!”

“Tang shengli continued, “Honey, whether it’s a dream or an ideal, setting a goal is the right thing to do! “Especially at our daughter’s age, she should chase after the light and strive for her own goal! “No matter if she succeeds in the end, at least she won’t leave any regrets for her youth. “Whose youth isn’t crazy?” ”

“Speaking up to this point, Tang Shengli sighed and said proudly, “Her mother, you’ve been through it. You should be able to understand our daughter’s current mood!” ”

“After hearing this, Xiao Qing’s expression calmed down a little. He looked at Tang mi and said, “Have you thought about the consequences of failure?” ”

“I have!”Tang mi nodded.

“Can you accept it?”Xiao Qing asked.

“Tang mi looked at Xiao Qing and said, “I can accept it! Just like Father said, I don’t want to leave any regrets for my youth! Even if my plan fails, I’m willing to bear the consequences!” ”

“Looking at the stubborn Tang Mi, Xiao Qing sighed helplessly! ”

“Through her daughter, she seemed to see herself when she was young. ” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“If she had been so brave at that time, she wouldn’t have left any regrets! ”

“Unfortunately, there were no ifs in life, only the present. ”

“”As long as you think it through!”Xiao Qing continued, “If you fail, you’re not allowed to cry beside me!” ”

“”Don’t worry, I Promise I won’t!”Tang mi smiled and said, “Thank you, Mom! Thank you, Dad!” ”

“Silly girl!”Tang Shengli patted Tang Mi’s head.

“Xiao Qing looked at Tang Mi, his eyes full of worry. ”

“Although she knew that the aircraft carrier plan might not succeed, as a mother, she could only respect Tang Mi. ”

As long as Tang Mi didn’t regret it.

“Xiao Qing looked at Tang mi and added, “Tang Mi, you have to think carefully. Sometimes, dreams can’t be done just by being hot-blooded!” ”

“”Yes, Mom, I know.”Tang mi continued, “Since I made this choice, I have thought about it carefully.” ”

“Whether she succeeded or failed, she wouldn’t regret making this decision. ”

“Xiao Qing looked at his daughter and didn’t say anything more, because she saw the determination in Tang Mi’s eyes. ”

Since that was the case.

Then let her try.

What if she succeeded!

On the other side.

“Tang looked at Tang Xue and asked curiously, “Why didn’t you tell me that Tang Mi had joined the aircraft carrier project team?” ”

Tang Xue ate a sliced pear. “It’s not a big deal!”
