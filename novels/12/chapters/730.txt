Translator: 549690339

She thought that Lin Qingxuan was like most men who would change their minds and dislike the old.

She did not expect that Lin Qingxuan was not that kind of person at all

“Even when she saw a young girl who was younger, prettier, and more qualified than Xia Xiaoman, Lin Qingxuan was still unmoved. She even begged Old Lady Lin bitterly.”

“Old Lady Lin narrowed her eyes and spoke angrily, “That Xia Xiaoman is a troublemaker! She hasn’t even passed the door yet, and she has already caused chaos in our Lin family! If they really get together, would qingxuan still have me as a mother in her eyes?””

Want her to agree to Lin Qingxuan and Xia Xiaoman getting together?

Impossible!

Who Was Xia Xiaoman?

“Auntie Wang continued, “As the saying goes, when a rabbit is anxious, it will bite. Aren’t you afraid that you will force Qingxuan into a corner?””

Old Madam Lin took a sip of tea. “Don’t worry! He won’t dare! Unless he doesn’t want me as his mother anymore!”Would Lin Qingxuan abandon her mother for a woman?

Of course not!

Lin Qingxuan valued filial piety the most.

“Old Master Lin had left early. He could understand how difficult it was for Old Madam Lin. Back then, it was old madam Lin who forced Lin Qingxuan to break up with her first girlfriend in the same way.”

Practice makes perfect.

That was why Old Lady Lin was so confident.

“Auntie Wang was still a little worried. “Old lady, apart from bringing up a child, Xia Xiaoman doesn’t have any other flaws. Otherwise...””

“Hearing that, Old Lady Lin immediately frowned. “No flaws? In terms of family background, how can Xia Xiaoman match up to our Lin Family? What kind of socialite can’t you find like Qingxuan? Who does Xia Xiaoman think she is?”” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Auntie Wang stopped talking.

Her advice was harsh to the ears.

“She had better do her job well. If she made the old lady unhappy, it would not be worth it to lose her job.”

“After being rejected by Old Lady Lin, Lin Qingxuan felt extremely uncomfortable.”

“Xia Xiaoman was still waiting for his reply, but Old Lady Lin’s attitude was so firm.”

He did not know how to tell Xia Xiaoman.

Lin Qingxuan stood up from the ground and walked towards his own courtyard. He pushed open the door of the wine storage room and began to search for wine.

It was said that one would get rid of a thousand worries after getting drunk. He was looking forward to Old Lady Lin helping them after getting drunk.

“After coming out of the wine storage room, Lin Qingxuan had a few bottles of wine in his hands.”

“Immediately, a servant told Old Lady Lin about this matter.”

“Old Lady Lin said, “Let him go! If he wants to drink, let him drink! After he sobers up, he will naturally know that I’m doing this for his own good!””

...

On the other side.

At the airport.

Ye Zao had just alighted from the plane when he saw a familiar figure at the airport’s entrance.

“He was dressed in a retro-styled long gown with a black knee-length coat draped over it. In his hand was a string of bright red Buddhist beads. Although he did not do anything, just standing there like that still made people feel intimidated.”

“In the crowd, his figure stood out like a crane among chickens, especially eye-catching.”

“Ye Shu said with a smile, “Isn’t that young master?””

“Lin Jin Cheng nodded. “That’s right, it’s little cen.”Initially, Lin Jin Cheng was still not used to calling him ‘little cen’because subconsciously, Cen Shaoqing had always been the fifth CEN who was the undisputed master of the capital.”

“But now, he could call him ‘Little Cen’easily.”

Lin Ze’s gaze swept past CEN Shaoqing and his tone was rather displeased. “He’s really attentive.”

“Although he already knew that Cen Shaoqing was ye Zao’s boyfriend, Lin Ze still did not want to accept this fact.”

“His sister was as beautiful as a flower. How did Cen Shaoqing, this old Fox, manage to woo her?”

“He had originally thought that ye Zao’s interest in Cen Shaoqing was only temporary. After this newness, Ye Zao would definitely lose interest in Cen Shaoqing.”

“Now, it seemed that the matter was more complicated than he had imagined.”

Ye Zao smiled as he walked forward. “When did you arrive?”

“It was said that a day of absence was like three years. He had not seen ye Zao for a week. Seeing ye Zao now, Cen Shaoqing felt a myriad of emotions in his heart. He felt that ye Zao seemed to have lost a lot of weight.”

“He wanted to hug ye Zao, but since Lin Jincheng and ye Shu were both present, he took the suitcase from ye Zao. “We just arrived. Did your journey go smoothly?””

Ye Zao nodded. “Very Smooth.”

“”Xiao Cen, how did you know that we were coming back today?”Lin Jincheng smiled at Cen Shaoqing.”

“Of course I told him.”Ye Zao looked back at Lin Jincheng.

“Lin Jincheng nodded and sighed in his heart. As expected, when a woman is old, she can’t be kept.”

Ye Zao was already 20 years old this year. He didn’t know how many years he could stay by their side.
