“Chapter 1588: 239: beat her up, too late for regrets! 3”

Translator: 549690339

Didn’t this rich family value birth?

“If Cen Shaoqing knew about ye Zao’s background, would he still be together with ye Zao?”

“Are you sure she’s an illegitimate daughter?”Zeng Qiuwen looked at Zeng Rou.

“”Yes, I’m sure.”Zeng rou nodded and continued, “I’ve known her since I was young! How could I Be Wrong?””

Zeng Qiuwen snorted coldly. “So what if I’ve known her since I was young? I still underestimated her!”

Zeng Rou was speechless and bit her lip.

No.

She had to turn the tables!

“After saying that, Zeng Qiuwen continued, “Just give it a rest! Don’t mess around with those things! Don’t you know that there’s a saying that goes, ‘If you’re smart, you’ll be fooled by your own cleverness’?”What kind of person was Cen Shaoqing, before he got a girlfriend, how could he not know the woman’s family background clearly?”

Zeng Qiuwen now had some doubts. Was it right or wrong to bring Zeng Rou to the Zhao family!

“She wanted to build herself a helper, not let Zeng Rou pull her crotch.”

Why didn’t she realize that Zeng Rou was so stupid in the past?

“Yes.”Zeng rou nodded reluctantly.

She had to prove to Zeng Qiuwen that she was not smart and was instead fooled by her own cleverness!

Ye Zao was just an unpresentable person.

Ye Zao was just not good enough for Cen Shaoqing!

“Thinking of this, Zeng Rou narrowed her eyes.”

Over here.

“Bai Shu looked at ye Zao and continued, “Zao Zao, go to your little aunt’s place. How is your little aunt’s health?””

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Don’t worry, little aunt’s health is quite good.””

“What about your uncle-in-law?”Bai Shu asked again.

“Ye Zhuo said, “Little aunt’s uncle-in-law’s health is also very good.””

“”That’s good.”Bai Shu continued, “When I have some free time in a few days, I’ll go and visit them. We’re old, and we’ll see each other less in the future. Between these sisters, there’s only this one life and no afterlife.””

“Speaking up to this point, Bai Shu raised her head and looked at Cen Shaoqing. “Shaoqing, when you go back, you should also advise your grandmother to let bygones be bygones.””

“Cen Shaoqing raised his eyes slightly and continued, “Aunt, don’t worry. My grandmother has already planned to visit little aunt in the next few days. It’s just that there are guests at home recently, so she can’t find the time.””

“Really?”Bai Shu asked in disbelief.

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Bai Shu smiled and said, “Then I’m really happy! These two old sisters have finally thought things through!””

“After saying that, Bai Shu continued, “Shaoqing, it’s not easy for you to come here with Zhuozhuo. You have to accompany Zhuozhuo here and have a good time.””

“”Our Flight is at 12 o’clock tomorrow afternoon,”Cen Shaoqing said.”

“Leaving so soon?”Bai Shu was stunned.

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “I still have other things to deal with when I go back.”

“Bai Shu still wanted to keep Cen Shaoqing around. She looked for Ah Niu and said, “Grandma, cousin is busy with his official business. Don’t delay his official business.””

“”That’s true.”Bai Shu nodded and looked up at Cen Shaoqing, then said, “Shaoqing, if you have time, remember to bring Zhonghua over often!””

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Seeing this scene, Zeng Rou narrowed her eyes.”

Ye Zhonghua was leaving tomorrow.

She had to make ye Zhonghua embarrassed tonight.

What should she think of?

Zeng rou bit her lip.

Ye Zao knew French.

What else could ye Zao not know?

It just so happened that she was good at it.

Zeng Rou was a little distressed.

“She had indeed learned a lot at home, but this was the Zhao family, and the others might not know less than her...”

It would not be good if she made a fool of herself and made a wedding dress for others. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

It seemed that.

She still had to start with ye Zao’s birth.

The Zhao family definitely did not know about ye Zao’s background.

“If they knew that ye Zao was the daughter of a mistress, the scene would definitely be very interesting.”

“Up until now, this method was very safe for Zeng Rou!”

Could Ye Zao still defend himself against this issue of his background?

“A moment later, Zeng Rou looked up at ye Zao and asked, “Zao Zao, I heard that Auntie and your uncle have gone to the capital, right?””

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Zeng rou smiled and said, “No wonder I didn’t find you when I went to the basement of Your House last time! So they really went to the capital!””

Basement?

“As soon as she said that, everyone looked at each other and saw doubt in each other’s eyes.”

Why would ye Zao Live in the basement?

“Fan Yiyi, a distant cousin of the Zhao family, smiled and said, “Xiao Rou, are you mistaken? Why would miss ye live in the basement?””

“”I’ve known Zhuozhuo for more than ten years. How could I be mistaken?”Zeng rou continued, “Oh right, zhuozhuo, is Auntie still single? If it were up to me, I’d say that Auntie is already old. It’s not good for her to always be single! “Although there were always people discussing Auntie’s lifestyle and even suspecting that you’re an illegitimate daughter, that was just a rumor after all. Searing, you go back and ask Aunty not to care about those things, people have to move on!””
