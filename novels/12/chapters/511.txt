“Okay.”Feng Qianhua nodded. “Then I’ll have to trouble you.”

“Aunt Zhang smiled and said, “Why are you still telling me that it’s not troublesome?” Aunt Zhang comforted her again. “Qianhua, don’t be too concerned about the engagement party. As long as the old lady’s heart is still on your side, then we still have a chance of winning! “A half-old ye Shu with a little bastard doesn’t pose a threat to you at all. In this world, even after getting married, you can still get a divorce. You’ve waited for nineteen years. Are you still afraid of this one and a half years?” ”

“”I know.”Feng Qianhua continued, “It’s getting dark. You can drop me off here.” ”

Aunt Zhang stopped in her tracks and instructed Feng Qianhua to drive carefully.

“Perhaps it was because old madam Feng had instructed her to, after returning to the Feng family, Feng Qianhua did not receive any ridicule from the four sisters-in-law. ”

Feng Xianxian was practicing her tea ceremony in the teahouse.

Feng Qianhua pushed the door open and entered. “I saw Old Madam Cen today.”

Feng Xianxian nodded.

“How do you feel?”

Feng Xianxian put down the cup in her hand. “I feel that old Madam Cen’s first impression of me is quite good. She even smiled at me!”

“Hearing this, Feng Qianhua was very satisfied. ”

“One had to know that the old Mrs. Cen was not an easy-going old lady. In the circle, no young lady from any family could win the favor of old Mrs. Cen. ”

And no one could make old Mrs. Cen happy.

Feng Qianqian was the first.

“After saying this, Feng Qianqian continued to ask, “Mom, did uncle Lin tell you why he suddenly canceled the engagement? When will you two hold the engagement party again?” ”

Feng Qianqian was very concerned about this matter.

“After all, it was related to when she could change her surname. ”

“Although she was now publicly acknowledged as the eldest daughter of the Lin family, she was still a little lacking compared to the legitimate one. ”

“Feng Qianhua looked at Feng qianqian and said slowly, “Your uncle Lin has already found that little bastard.” ”

What?

Found Him?

“Feng Qianqian was stunned and her face turned pale. “Mom, what did you say?” ”

“If Lin Jincheng found his biological daughter, what would she do? ”

She was the eldest daughter of the Lin Family!

That Bastard had disappeared for 19 years. Why would he come back?

“Feng Qianhua continued, “But you don’t have to worry too much. That Bastard is a famous waste in Yun Jing City. He’s also a joke that everyone talks about after dinner. He can’t be compared to you.” ”

“It’s actually a good thing for you to have her back.”

The good and the bad had to be compared.

“Feng Qianqian was already outstanding enough. If she were to bring back a trash who didn’t know anything, it would make Feng Qianqian even more outstanding. ”

“When that time came, the outside world would think that Feng Qianqian was more suitable to be the Lin family’s eldest daughter than the real eldest daughter of the Lin Family! ”

“Meanwhile, Lin Jincheng’s impression of ye Shu was still stuck at 19 years ago. ”

“19 years ago, Ye Shu was already a little girl. Now, Ye Shu was already a middle-aged woman. In addition, Ye Shu was also a person who didn’t have any knowledge or education and couldn’t even distinguish 26 English letters. Lin Jincheng was well-informed and knowledgeable, it was impossible for him to have any common language with ye Shu! ”

“Perhaps, in a few days, Lin Jincheng would dislike ye Shu. ”

Ye Shu was just a vulgar village woman. She wasn’t worthy of Lin Jincheng at all. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“At that time, Lin Jincheng would realize that only she and he were a match made in heaven! ”

A pair made from the earth.

“Hearing Feng Qianhua’s words, Feng Xianxian felt a lot better. The corners of her mouth curled up into a smile. “Mom, you’re right! A Little Bastard can’t compete with me in anything. What can he use to fight me?” ”

“Feng Qianhua continued, “The Lin family will definitely hold an identification ceremony in the next few days. Remember to make preparations.” ”

“Judging from Lin Jincheng’s intentions, Feng Qianhua knew that an identification ceremony was definitely necessary. ”

“At the identification ceremony, it was the best time for Feng Qianqian to step on Ye Zao. ”

“Okay.”Feng Qianqian instantly understood what Feng Qianhua meant.

“If she remembered correctly, Lin Ze hated dealing with girls, and he disliked his sister even more. ”

“When that time came, the family identification party would definitely be very lively! ”

“That Little Bastard, if he wanted to secure his position as the eldest daughter of the Lin family, he probably wouldn’t even be able to get past Lin Ze. ”

Feng Xianxian had grown up with Lin Ze since young. She knew Lin ze too well.

Lin Ze wasn’t a good brother!

“If Lin Ze was willing to accept his sister, Feng Qianhua would have married into the Lin family a long time ago. ”

“She had also become the eldest daughter of the Lin family a long time ago. Even though she was so outstanding, she still couldn’t get Lin Ze’s approval. How could that little bastard who didn’t know anything do it? ”

Feng Xianxian couldn’t wait for the family reunion to come earlier.
