“Sun Yu looked at everyone’s expressions and continued, “Everyone, we’ve been in the Cen family for so many years, have any of you heard of a 2 member?””

A 2 member?

“When they heard this, everyone looked at each other. They could see the confusion in each other’s eyes.”

“After so many years, they really hadn’t seen any a 2 member in the base.”

“Brother Sun is right. Master five must have run out of ideas and thought of this to scare us! So that we can all go back to work!”

“”Yes, yes, yes, that must be the case!””

“We can’t be deceived by master five!”

“Sun Yu said, “I have already thought of it for everyone. When master five comes to beg us to go back, we have to make an additional request to master five.””

“What request?”

“Sun Yu faced everyone and said with a smile, “An increase in annual salary. Everyone, how about this number?”At the end, Sun Yu made a ‘7’gesture.”

“Alright!”

Everyone cheered.

Who Didn’t like an increase in salary?

“It was also at this moment that someone asked, “What if master five doesn’t give us an increase in annual salary?””

“Sun Yu said, “Do we still remember the last order before the strike?”” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Old Qian stood up and said, “Is it the batch of goods ordered by country L?””

“”Yes.”Sun Yu nodded, then, she said, “The most crucial step of the batch of goods ordered by country L is still in Professor Yue’s hands. Professor Yue has already told me that she will definitely help everyone fight for the wish of a raise in their annual salary!””

“Upon hearing this, everyone immediately cheered, “Long live professor Yue!””

“Professor Yue!”

“Sun Yu raised her hands to signal for everyone to be quiet and continued, “So, everyone just have to wait patiently. Don’t worry, professor Yue will not let everyone down!””

“We will listen to Professor Yue.”

On the other side.

Cen’s base.

“Professor MA was familiarizing himself with the overall work flow of the research room when suddenly, Tang Ruye came over. “Professor Ma!””

“What’s Wrong?”Professor Ma put down the document in his hand and looked up at Tang Ruye.

“Tang ruye continued, “Professor MA, there’s a problem with the quality inspection team. Please come over and take a look.””

Professor ma nodded and locked the computer screen to follow Tang Ruye’s footsteps.

“Soon, the two of them arrived at the quality inspection team together.”

“The team leader, Chu Liang, stood up and said, “Professor Ma, look at this chip. It has never passed the quality inspection, but I can’t see what the problem is.””

“Move aside.”

Chu Liang stood up and gave his seat to Professor Ma.

“Professor Ma sat in his chair and placed the chip with the problem under the microscope, observing it carefully.”

“Soon, he found the problem and looked up at Chu Liang, “Inform the production team to temporarily stop production. A program on the chip has been added with a password. Now we need to crack the password and reset it. Before the program is set, the production team should not act Rashly.””

“Chu Liang nodded. “Okay, I understand.””

Professor Ma brought the chip back to his office.

“Professor Ma had thought that cracking the password would be very easy. He had not expected that after cracking the password, there would be another one.”

It was just like the poem.

“The wildfire would not burn out, and the spring breeze would blow again.”

“Professor ma frowned. Master five had asked him to accept section B because of his trust in him. No matter what, he could not betray Cen Shaoqing’s trust.”

“When it was time to get off work, the lights in Professor Ma’s office were still on.”

Professor Yue sat on the sofa and talked to Tang Xue on the phone. His eyes were full of smiles. “Is that so? You haven’t Gone Back Yet?”

“Tang Xue said, “Yes, I heard from the person with the same name as Sun Yu that Ma Jianguo has been studying for an entire afternoon!”Ma Jianguo was Professor Ma’s real name.”

“”Let alone an entire afternoon, even if he studies for an entire year, he wouldn’t be able to come up with anything like Chou Yin Mao!””

“”That’s right.”Tang Xue flattered, “Aunt Yue, the password that you set, not to mention Ma Jianguo, I’m afraid that even if fifth master personally does it, he wouldn’t be able to crack it!””

“Professor Yue looked at the clock hanging on the wall and said with a smile, “Alright, Alright. Xiaoxue, it’s getting late. You should go back earlier. I need to rest.””

“Tang Xue said, “You’ve been in the base for so many years and haven’t had a good rest. You should take this opportunity to have a good rest. Goodbye.””

“”Goodbye.”After saying this, professor Yue hung up the phone.”

“After hanging up the phone, professor Yue hummed a tune and walked towards the bedroom.”

“Seeing her like this, Wan Sheng said, “Hongyan, Lord fifth called you?””
