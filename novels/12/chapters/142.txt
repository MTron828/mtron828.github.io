Chapter 143: 084: Retribution for evil. Lin Ze came to Yun Jing! 2

Hearing this, Lin Xiaowei’s eyes turned even redder. “Xiao Xuan, Xiao Xuan went in too...”

“Where did she go?”Ye Dafu looked puzzled.

Lin Xiaowei told them what happened, “Big Sis was afraid that you guys would be worried, so she didn’t let us tell you. Big Brother-in-law was fired by the hospital. Big Brother-in-law was fired by the hospital. Their family’s villa has been sold, and their car has been mortgaged...”

This was really a case of the house falling into the rain at the same time.

Ye Dafu’s face instantly turned pale.

He was sad not because of the sudden change in ye Shuang’s family, but because he was worried that without Lin Xuan’s help, Ye Shuai would not be able to come out.

“Then get Shuai Zi a lawyer! Get the best lawyer! Oh right! We still have to arrange things from top to bottom. Don’t worry about the money. If it’s really not enough, our family can sell the house!”

Although the ye family was not very rich.

They still had some money.

After all, when they were demolishing the house back then, they had split five houses in one go.

Now, they had two houses to live in.

Three more were rented out!

Three houses could be sold for at least six or seven million.

Lin Xiaowei wiped away her tears. “Alright! I’ll Go Now!”As long as ye Shuaizi could come out safely, not to mention selling one house, she was willing to sell all of them.

Today was the Day Ye Shu was discharged from the hospital.

Early in the morning, Ye Sen came over with fresh flowers in his hands to pick up ye Shu.

“Sis! Congratulations on being discharged!”

“You’re the only one with a lot of tricks!”Ye Shu received the flowers with one hand.

Ye Zhuo followed behind her to carry her luggage. Fortunately, it was summer and her clothes were thin, so the mother and daughter did not have much luggage.

“Uncle, are you going on a blind date wearing such a handsome outfit today?”Ye Sen, who had never liked to dress up, actually wore a new outfit today. He was wearing a handmade suit and black patent leather shoes. Ye Sen’s foundation was not bad, so with such a dressing up.., he looked like he was going on a blind date.

“What do you mean by handsome?”Ye Sen took the bow from ye Zao. “Your uncle is originally handsome, okay?”

Ye Shu:”...”she finally understood why ye Zao always liked to look at himself in the mirror and say, “How come I’m so Handsome!”

As the saying goes, a nephew looks like an uncle.

It turned out that these things were inherited.

Narcissism was not without reason.

They got into the van and arrived home in a short while.

Ye Zao found a vase and kept the fiery red roses in it. The originally clean living room suddenly had a bunch of roses, which looked quite eye-catching.

The air was filled with the scent of perfume roses.

It smelled very good.

At noon, Ye Zao ordered takeout from a restaurant that focused on health food.

During lunch, ye Zao tried to tell ye Shu about the recent happenings in the Ye family.

“Mom, Lin Haifu raised a mistress outside and was reported by ye Shuang. Now, he has been dismissed by the hospital. Lin Xuan is still in the detention center because she perjured herself. It’s very likely that she will be sentenced!”

Ye Shu was stunned.

Obviously, she did not expect that in just a few days, ye Shuang’s family would have such a huge change.

She had clearly seen ye Shuang a week ago.

At that time, she was still a high and mighty lady!

“Mom, if aunt comes to beg you, will you help her?”

Ye Shu said, “I’m not a big shot, how can I help her?”

“What if she asks you to give her money?”Ye Zhuo continued to ask.

Money was easy to handle.

Ye Shuang had already moved from the Big Villa to the basement, in case she came to beg ye Shu.

Ye Zhuo was afraid that ye Shu would be soft-hearted again.

“No.”Ye Shu’s expression was calm. “I have nothing to do with them now.”

After experiencing the pain of losing a finger.

Ye Shu was already extremely disappointed with those so-called relatives.

The main road was facing the sky. They could just walk to one side.

Seeing ye Shu like this, ye Zhuo continued, “Also, something happened at home. Commander ye is suspected of fraud and has been arrested. They are now looking for ways to sell the house and make some connections to save Commander Ye.”

Ye Shu was stunned again.

What a coincidence. Why did something happen at the same time? Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

And it happened after she lost her finger?

Could it be ye Zao?

Thinking of this, Ye Shu felt that she was overthinking.

No matter how powerful ye Zao was, he was only 18 years old.

How could an 18-year-old child have such great abilities!

Ye Shu looked at ye Zao and said seriously, “Zao, don’t worry. Mom has really let go. In the future, whether life or death at home has nothing to do with me!”

Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Mom, I’m much more relieved that you can think like this.”

“Silly child.”After saying that, ye Shu continued, “Zao Zao, Mom wants to ask you something?”
