“Upon receiving ye Zao’s affirmative answer, Bai Jingshu was instantly stunned. She simply could not believe that this was real! ”

She was pregnant?

How was that possible!

“Although she had always wanted to have a child, she did not have any signs of pregnancy at all. ”

“”Zao Zao, did you make a mistake?”Bai Jingshu looked at ye Zao and continued, “Recently, other than my poor sleep, everything else is normal.” ”

She ate well and drank well.

Her appetite was even better than before.

“Under normal circumstances, her appetite should have deteriorated after pregnancy. ”

“Although she had never been pregnant, she had watched television before. ”

“On television, whenever the female lead got pregnant, she would definitely throw up and suffer from all sorts of loss of appetite and listlessness. ”

“However, Bai Jingshu did not have any of these symptoms. ”

“Not only did her appetite not deteriorate, it was even better than before. ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Don’t worry, there won’t be any mistakes. According to the pulse, it should be five weeks.” ”

“”Five weeks?”Ye Shu continued, “Five weeks means a month?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Bai Jingshu was still in disbelief. She looked up at ye Zao and asked, “Zao Zao, am I really pregnant?” ”

“Really.”

“Then why didn’t I throw up?”Bai Jingshu asked. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Everyone’s pregnancy reaction is different. Sister-in-law, don’t be misled by those TV dramas.” ”

“Really?”Bai Jingshu asked.

“”Of course it’s true.”Ye Zao stood up. “Sister-in-law, let’s go to the hospital now. You still have to undergo a comprehensive check-up.” ”

“”Go, go, Go!”Ye Shu continued, “I’ll contact Ah Ze to come back now!” ”

“I’ll contact him!”Lin Jincheng said.

Lin Jincheng had not said a single word since just now.

He was going to be a grandfather!

“Bai Jingshu raised her head to look at Lin Jincheng. “Dad, it’s better not to contact ah ze. He’s been very busy these few days. This isn’t a big deal. I’ll just go to the hospital. There’s no other use for him to come back.” ”

“”That’s not a big deal!”Ye Shu said, “Ah Ze is the child’s father!”! He should be the first to know about this news. No matter how important it is, it’s not as important as his wife and child! Jincheng, quickly contact ah ze. I’ll arrange for the chauffeur. Let’s go to the hospital immediately!” ”

“Bai Jingshu was stunned. “Mom, are we still going to the hospital now?” ”

It was already past seven in the evening!

Ye Shu nodded. “Yes!”

Bai Jingshu felt that everyone was being a little too grand.

Wasn’t it just a pregnancy?

“Ye Zhuo saw through Bai Jingshu’s thoughts and smiled. “Sister-in-law, just listen to Mom and Dad! If you don’t go to the hospital tonight, they’ll probably have a hard time sleeping.” ”

“Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded and subconsciously placed her left hand on her abdomen.

Was there really a baby already here?

Why was everything so surreal?

“Bai Jingshu turned to look at ye Zao. “Zao Zao, am... am I really pregnant?” ”

“Ye Zao chuckled. “Sister-in-law, do you still not believe in my medical skills?” ”

“”It’s not that I don’t believe in you, but I just find it unbelievable.”Bai Jingshu held ye Zao’s hand and continued, “Zao Zao, do you know how much your brother and I hope to have a child?” ”

“They had been married for some time and did not have any contraception. However, they had never been able to get pregnant. Although no one urged them, Bai Jingshu was still anxious. ”

“Now that the child had suddenly arrived, it made Bai Jingshu feel very surreal. ”

She felt as if she was dreaming.

“Ye Zao smiled. “Sister-in-law, I’ve said before that we can’t force our children’s fate, and we can’t be anxious either. When the day comes, it will naturally come.” ”

Bai Jingshu nodded. “You’re right.”

It wasn’t just a matter of time.

“On the other side, Ye Shu had already arranged for a car. ”

Lin Jincheng also contacted Lin Ze.

“Ye Shu asked, “When will ah ze be back?” ”

“”He said he’ll be home soon,”Lin Jincheng replied. ”

“Ye Shu thought for a moment and then said, “Call Ah Ze and tell him to go straight to the hospital. It’s closer to the hospital. Let’s go straight to the hospital now.” ”

“Okay.”Lin Jincheng nodded and contacted Lin ze again.

“Ye Shu came to the living room. “Jingshu, zhuoluo, let’s Go First! I asked your father to contact Ah Ze and tell him to go to the hospital first!” ”

Ye Zhuoluo helped Bai Jingshu get up from the sofa.

The few of them walked out of the door together.

The nanny van had already stopped outside the door.

The hospital was about thirty minutes away from the Lin family manor.

“Ye Shu was anxious, but she did not dare to let the driver drive too fast. She turned to look at Ye Zao. “Zao Zao, Tell Jingshu if there are any taboos during pregnancy.” ”
