“”Miss Ye, I won’t bother you anymore. I’ll go back first,”the old lady continued. ”

“”I’ll get someone to send you back,”ye Zao said. ”

“”No need,”the old lady refused with a smile. “There’s a driver waiting for me outside.” ”

“”That’s fine.”Ye Zao nodded slightly. “By the way, I’ll leave a number for you. If you encounter any difficulties in the future, or if you’re bored at home and want to find someone to chat with, you can call me anytime.” ”

“As Ye Zhuo spoke, he picked up his notebook and pen from the table and wrote down his phone number to the old lady. ”

“The old lady took the notebook with both hands. “Thank you, Miss Ye.” ”

“You’re too polite.”

Ye Zhuo sent the old lady out of the base and watched the car disappear into the air before walking into the base.

“Ceng Hu followed behind ye Zhuo, he couldn’t help but sigh. “Feng Qi’s mother is completely different from Feng Qi. I really don’t know why the old lady has a daughter like that! It’s fine if the daughter is like that, but the granddaughter is also like that!”Other people had saved the Milky Way in their previous lives, ceng Hu now suspected whether the old lady had destroyed the Milky Way in her previous life! ”

Ye Zhuo thought seriously for a moment. “Maybe there’s something wrong with Feng Qi’s paternal genes. But it has something to do with the acquired effects.”

Cen Hu nodded.

On the other side.

The Feng family.

“Feng Ying almost turned the old lady’s room upside down, but she couldn’t find Suyu. ”

Where was Suyu?

Feng Ying was a little anxious.

“If she couldn’t find Suyu, how was she going to explain to Tina? ”

“Where did grandma hide the Thing!”Feng Ying frowned.

“At this moment, the sound of a car engine came from downstairs. ”

Is the old lady back?

Feng Ying’s eyebrows jumped and she immediately went to the balcony.

“Sure enough, the old lady was back! ”

“Seeing the old lady, Feng Ying immediately ran back to her room and tidied up the things inside. ”

“Ten minutes later, Feng Ying pretended that nothing had happened and came downstairs. “Grandma, you’re back.” ”

“Yes.”The old lady nodded.

“Feng Ying continued, “Grandma, what do you want to Eat Tonight? I’ll make it for you.” ”

“The old lady smiled and said, “I’ll eat anything.” ”

“Then I’ll make my best dishes.”

“Okay.”The old lady nodded.

“In order to please the old lady, Feng Ying cooked a big table of good dishes that night. She also wanted to ask about the situation of the vegetable jade, but she swallowed the words at the tip of her tongue, not knowing how to say it. ”

Feng Ying grew up by the old lady’s side. She knew that the old lady was not easy to fool.

But now time was so tight.

“”Grandma, your teeth are not good. Eat more tofu soup. This tofu soup is very delicious.”Feng Ying scooped some tofu soup for the old lady. ”

“The tofu soup was sour and spicy, very appetizing. It was very suitable for the elderly with bad teeth. ”

“Okay.”The old lady nodded and took a bite of the tofu soup.

“How is it? Do you think it’s Delicious?”Feng Ying asked impatiently.

“”It’s Delicious.”The old lady nodded. “Xiao Ying, as long as it’s made by you, I like to eat it.” ”

“Then try this again.”Feng Ying picked up some pork stewed noodles for the old lady.

The noodles and pork were stewed until they were soft and rotten. They melted in the mouth and were very suitable for the elderly.

And the pork stewed noodles were the dishes of the old lady’s hometown.

“Feng Ying put food into the old lady’s Bowl and said, “Grandma, do you still remember what day it is Tomorrow?” ”

“Yes.”The old lady nodded. “Tomorrow is your birthday.”

“Feng Ying said in surprise, “I didn’t expect you to remember! I thought you had forgotten!” ”

“The old lady smiled and said, “How could I forget your birthday!” ”

“Then what are you going to give me for my birthday?”Feng Ying continued to ask.

“The old lady asked, “What do you want?” ”

Feng Ying’s eyes rolled around. “Are you going to give me whatever I want?”

“”Yes.”The old lady nodded. “You are my only granddaughter. If I don’t give it to you, who else can I give it to? Can I leave it to an outsider?” ” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“”Thank you, Grandma!”Feng Ying hugged the old lady’s neck intimately and asked tentatively, “Grandma, are you really going to give me anything I Want?” ”

“Of course!”The old lady patted Feng Ying’s hand. “When have I ever lied to You?”

“”Then...”Feng Ying hesitated for a moment and then said, “I, I want the plain jade, is that okay?” ”

“”Yes!”The old lady smiled and said, “That plain jade was meant to be kept for you. It doesn’t matter if I give it to you sooner or later. I will give it to you tomorrow on your birthday.” ”
