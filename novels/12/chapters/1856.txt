“”Don’t worry, my body is very strong.”She could not wait to solve all the puzzles. How could she wait for a week? ”

Cen Shaoqing looked ahead and focused on driving. He did not say anything.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “If you hypnotize me, I will end your internship early. How about that?” ”

“Hearing that, Cen Shaoqing remained silent. ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “I know you’re worried about me, but don’t worry, my body is really good! I promise you, nothing will happen to me! I’m a doctor, do you think I can still perform stewing myself in an iron pot?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing was right. Hypnosis was indeed bad for her body, but it was within the range that she could withstand. ”

“Be Good.”Cen Shaoqing held the steering wheel with one hand and patted ye Zao’s head with the other.

“Soon, the car stopped at the entrance of Beijing University. ”

Ye Zao got out of the car. “I’ll be leaving first.”

Cen Shaoqing stood in front of the car and nodded slightly. “Go. I’ll pick you up at night.”

“”You can come the day after tomorrow.”Ye Zao continued, “We have exams tomorrow. I’ll stay in the dormitory tonight.” ”

“Speaking of which, Ye Zhuo had not stayed in the dormitory for a long time. ”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Watching ye Zhuo’s figure disappear in front of him, Cen Shaoqing turned around and got into the car. ”

Ye Zhuo came all the way to the laboratory. The professor was already waiting inside.

Two days later.

Winter vacation officially began.

“Originally, Li Yueyue was going to take the green train home. ”

“But father Li was worried and insisted on flying over to pick up Li Yueyue. Helpless, Li Yueyue could only follow her father to the airport. ”

The father and daughter chatted as they walked.

“This scene was coincidentally seen by Ouyang Nai, who was walking in front. ”

Ouyang nai frowned slightly. Li Yueyue?

What did Li Yueyue want?

She chased him all the way to the airport!

A poor student like Li Yueyue definitely wasn’t here to take a plane.

Was She Rich?

“At this moment, Ouyang Yuan stopped in his tracks. “Xiao Nai, wait a moment. I’ll go and summon boss Li.” ”

“Ouyang Yuan was Ouyang Nai’s father. Due to his work, he had met many bosses. ”

“Okay.”Ouyang Nai nodded.

“Ouyang Yuan jogged over. Ouyang Nai took out her phone to take a look. When he looked up again, he saw his father standing beside Li Yueyue and the middle-aged man. ”

Could it be that the boss Li that his father was talking about was the middle-aged man beside Li Yueyue?

What was the relationship between Li Yueyue and him?

Could she be a mistress?

“Thinking of this, Ouyang Nai had goosebumps all over her body. ”

She didn’t expect that Li Yueyue was such a woman!

“Soon, Ouyang Yuan came back. Ouyang nai asked curiously, “Dad, was that boss Li just now?” ”

“Ouyang Yuan nodded and said, “The one next to him is his daughter, Li Yueyue. She’s also from Beijing University.” ”

Boom.

Something exploded in Ouyang Yuan’s mind.

Who Was Li Yueyue?

Boss Li’s Daughter?

How could that be!

Li Yueyue’s family was just a cattle breeder. How could she be boss Li’s Daughter?

No!

This was impossible!

Ouyang Nai took a deep breath.

“Ouyang Yuan asked curiously, “Little Nai, what’s wrong? Are you not feeling well?” ”

Ouyang Nai shook her head. “No.”

“After saying that, ouyang nai continued, “Dad, Wait for me here. I’ll be back soon.” ” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Ouyang Nai jogged all the way to Li Yueyue’s side.

“Li Yueyue.”

“What’s Wrong?”Li Yueyue looked at Ouyang Nai.

“Ouyang nai continued, “Didn’t you say that your family raised cattle? You Lied to me!” ”

“Li Yueyue looked up at Ouyang Nai. “Our family not only raises cattle, but all the cattle and sheep in the grassland belong to our family.” ”
