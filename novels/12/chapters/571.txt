This made Old Lady Lin even more partial to her.

“Furthermore, Zhao shuning was so filial. ”

“Zhao shuning helped Old Lady Lin Wipe Her face as she said, “Mom, what are you talking about? I’ve never felt that our Lin family has let me down in any way. We’re all one family. It’s too much for you to say these things.” ”

“Old Lady Lin Sighed. “Good child, I’ve let you down.” ”

“As a woman, Old Lady Lin could understand Zhao Shuning’s pain. ”

“So, even if she knew about what happened last night, Old Lady Lin still turned a blind eye. ”

Zhao shuning couldn’t have children because of Lin Qingxuan. Shouldn’t she let Zhao shuning vent a little?

There was no such thing in the world!

Zhao shuning helped Old Lady Lin wipe her face again. “I’m not wronged. It’s my fortune to be able to marry into the Lin family. I’ve never felt wronged.”

Old Lady Lin was very gratified.

Older people could not tolerate disobedience.

“”Oh right, what time did you and Li Yibiao Meet?”Old Lady Lin continued to ask. ”

“Zhao shuning said, “We only agreed to meet this morning. We didn’t agree to meet at what time.” ”

Old Lady Lin nodded. “It’s good that he can come.”

“Zhao shuning helped Old Lady Lin to the dining room. “Mom, don’t worry. He will definitely come.” ”

“In the dining room, the dishes were already placed on the table. ” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Old Lady Lin’s breakfast was very exquisite.

“There were steamed crystal shrimp dumplings, fried eggs, red date cake, lean meat porridge with preserved eggs, wonton noodles... ”

“Old Lady Lin sat down to eat. “Shuning, sit down and eat with us.” ”

“Zhao shuning smiled and said, “I’ve already eaten.” ”

“After saying that, Zhao shuning said, “Mom, when do you think we should set the wedding date when Li Yibiao will come over to discuss the wedding?” ”

“What do you think?”Old Lady Lin asked.

“Zhao shuning narrowed his eyes, “As the saying goes, the faster the knife, the better. In my opinion, the faster the better!”! “If Li Yibiao Likes Ye Zao, it would be best if Li Yibiao brings ye Zao back to spend a few days with him. If the two of them get together, they have to develop a relationship!” ”

“When the time came, even if Lin Jincheng objected, it would be useless. ”

“At this point, Zhao shuning sighed and said worriedly, “I just don’t know if ye Zao is willing. After all, Li Yibiao is already so old.” ”

Zhao shuning hated ye Zao.

She wished that ye Zao would immediately disappear from her sight!

“”She dares to disagree!”Old Lady Lin slammed her chopsticks on the table. “As a grandmother, I’ve already made a decision, but it’s not up to her!” ”

Old Lady Lin felt that she was the most authoritative existence in the Lin family.

She couldn’t allow anyone to disobey her!

“And that Disobedient Wild Girl, Ye Zao, was even worse! ”

“The corners of Zhao Shuning’s mouth curled up into a smile as he continued, “Then, we can’t let Jin City know about this for the time being. According to his personality, if he finds out about this, he will definitely cause a ruckus with us.” ”

“Yes.”Old Lady Lin nodded.

...

At the same time.

At the hospital.

“Standing at the entrance of the hospital, Lin Qingxuan was a little nervous. ”

He was afraid of the same outcome.

“”Fourth brother, let’s go in quickly.” ”

“Lin Qingxuan took a deep breath. “Jin Cheng, why don’t We Forget About It?” ”

He was a little afraid of facing the result.

“Lin Jin Cheng grabbed Lin Qingxuan’s wrist. “Fourth brother, you have to give yourself an explanation this time.” ”

Lin Qingxuan followed Lin Jin Cheng to the hospital.

They hung up the infertility department.

There were many items to check for infertility.

“After the examination, they still had to wait for an hour before they could see the results. ”

Lin Qingxuan sat on the blue plastic chair in the waiting area. His brows were furrowed and his eyes were filled with unease.

“”Fourth brother, don’t worry,”Lin Jincheng comforted him. ”

Lin Qingxuan smiled. “Don’t worry.”

“After saying that, Lin Qingxuan took out a cigarette and handed it to Lin Jincheng. “Have a cigarette?” ”

Lin Jincheng waved his hand and refused.

“You quit?”Lin Qingxuan was a little surprised.

One had to know that Lin Jincheng used to be a heavy smoker.

“”Yes.”Lin Jincheng smiled and said, “Burning said that smoking is not good for the body, so I quit. Fourth Brother, you should smoke less.” ”

“Lin Qingxuan said, “I have smoked for more than ten years. How can I quit in such a short time? Then I will go outside to smoke and go out to get some fresh air!” ”

“Okay.”Lin Jincheng nodded.

“Lin Qingxuan took the cigarette and walked outside. He stood on the steps and lit the cigarette. Just as he took a puff, he was hit by someone. ”

PA —

The lighter and the cigarette case fell to the ground.

“Then, a pair of hands picked up the things that fell to the ground and handed them to him. ”
