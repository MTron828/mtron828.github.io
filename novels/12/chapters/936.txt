“Chapter 937: 210: the whole Internet is in an uproar, never admit defeat! 1”

“The next second, all the reporters were stunned.”

Internship?

“Who could believe that Cen Wuye, chasing his wife, actually wanted an internship?”

Everyone thought that they were hearing things.

“Hearing this, song Chenyu’s face immediately turned pale.”

She did not expect Cen Shaoqing to actually admit his relationship with Ye Zhuo in front of the camera.

Not only did he admit it.

He also indirectly raised ye Zhuo’s status.

Internship.

The man she was desperately chasing was just an intern in ye Zhuo’s eyes!

And he was so humble.

What was this?

What was so good about Ye Zhuo? Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Was Cen Shaoqing Blind?

She was so outstanding and brilliant. She knew Cen Shaoqing before ye Zhuo. Why did Cen Shaoqing not like her?

She should be CEN Shaoqing’s girlfriend!

“A reporter quickly reacted and continued, “CEN fifth master, do you mean that you’re still Miss Ye’s intern boyfriend?””

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“The reporter immediately handed the microphone to Ye Zhuo. “Miss Ye, may I ask what you’re thinking of letting Cen fifth master become an official?””

“Cen Shaoqing turned his head to look at ye Zao, his eyes filled with anticipation.”

He also wanted to know when his internship would end.

“Ye Zao’s tone was faint, and there seemed to be a faint layer of snow between his brows. “That depends on his performance.””

“Cen Shaoqing seemed to be in a good mood today, so the reporter mustered up his courage and asked, “CEN fifth master, I heard that you’re an anti-marriage activist. May I ask if you and Miss Ye will step into marriage?””

So what if Cen Shaoqing admitted that Ye Zao was his girlfriend?

The most important thing was to get married.

Cen Shaoqing had once said in front of the media that he was an unmarried man.

Would he marry ye Zao if he was an unmarried man?

Definitely Not!

“Upon hearing this, song Chenyu felt much better. He raised his head and looked over again.”

“Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “The great literary hero, Shakespeare, once said that all relationships that do not aim at marriage are hooliganism.””

“After a long while, the reporter finally reacted and continued,”... So, you mean that you will step into the marriage hall with Miss Ye?””

“”Yes.”Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted slightly. “If Zhuo Zhuo is willing to marry me, it will be my fortune for three lifetimes.””

Marry down.

He was talking about marrying down.

The reporters almost thought that they were hearing things.

The Cen family was the number one family in Huaxia.

“But in his eyes, if ye Zao could marry him, he would marry down instead of climbing up the social ladder.”

It was enough to show ye Zao’s position in Cen Shaoqing’s heart.

“Song Chenyu’s already pale face was now as white as a sheet of paper. She looked at the two figures, her hands clenched into fists, and her whole body was trembling.”

“There were too many reporters at the scene. In order to prevent others from taking pictures of her, song Chenyu turned around and walked inside.”

“On this side, the reporters wanted to ask more questions, but Cen Shaoqing directly escorted ye Zao to the press conference.”

None of the reporters behind them dared to chase after them. They could only let the cameraman take a few pictures of the two’s backs.

Cen Shaoqing was in a good mood today.

“If it was any other day, these reporters would not be able to post anything they took.”

“The press conference was still going on. At this time, Weibo was already exploding.”

“[ F * ck, I did not expect things to turn out this way! ]”

[ I feel that those reporters are so miserable. They are fed dog food again and again. ]

[ I like this kind of face slapping! ]

“[ ah, ah, ah, this is too doting! Did you guys notice Cen Wuye’s choice of Words? He is talking about marrying down. ]”

[ our Yezi is so outstanding. He is already a high social climber. ]

“[ he looked at Cen Wuye and then looked at his boyfriend who was sleeping at the side. Without saying anything, he gave him a kick. ]”

“[ as expected, the richer a man is, the more monogamous he is. Only those who don’t have money do those disgusting things outside! ]”

[ add one above. ]

“[ hahaha, those who said that Ye Zi was kept as a mistress have been slapped in the face! ]”

“[ kept as a mistress can still be considered as a mistress, but the mistress has changed from Ye Zi to Cen Wuye. ]”

[ I now seriously suspect that Cen Wuye found someone to expose those two photos in order to confirm his relationship with Ye Zi. ]

[ please be more confident above. Remove the suspicion. The photos that were trending in the search earlier must have been released by Cen Wuye. ]

[ I agree with the person above. ]

“[ in order to become an official, Cen Wuye is going all out. ]”
