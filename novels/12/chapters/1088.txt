“Si Lu walked over and said politely, “Uncle.” ”

Father Zhao held Si Lu’s arm. “The kitchen has already prepared the dishes. We’re just waiting for you guys to come back. Let’s go and eat.”

Si Lu followed Father Zhao in the direction of the restaurant.

Zhao Xueyin followed behind them.

“The housekeeper began to arrange for the dishes to be served in the kitchen. Although there were only three people eating at night, the dishes were very rich and filled the entire table. ”

Father Zhao kept putting food into Si Lu’s bowl.

Zhao Xueyin ate the entire meal as if it were wax.

“After eating, she chatted with Father Zhao for a while before Si Lu suggested leaving. ”

“Father Zhao smiled and said, “Today is the LABA festival, and it’s already so late. Why Don’t you stay at home and rest for the night?” ”

“”No.”The lawyer glanced at Zhao Xueyin and politely refused, “I have something to do when I go back.” ”

“”Since you have something to do, I won’t keep you,”father Zhao continued, “Xueyin, go and see Ah Lui off.” ”

“Okay.”Zhao Xueyin stood up.

“The lawyer looked at father Zhao and said, “Uncle, I’ll be leaving first.” ”

“”It’s snowing outside. Drive slowly on the road,”Father Zhao instructed. ”

Si Lu nodded. “I know.”

“After saying that, Si Lu turned around and walked towards the door. ”

Zhao Xueyin followed his footsteps.

“At this moment, father Zhao suddenly said, “Ah Lu, wait a moment.” ”

“”Uncle, is there anything else?”Si Lu turned around and looked at Father Zhao. ”

“Father Zhao said, “There was a lot of preserved laba garlic in the kitchen today. I’ll get the butler to bring some for you.” ”

“”Thank you, Uncle.” ”

“Father Zhao smiled and said, “A family doesn’t talk like two families. You’re being too polite.” ”

“Soon, the butler ran over with the preserved laba garlic in his hand. “Mr. SI, here. This preserved laba garlic was just preserved. You’ll have to wait for ten days to half a month before you can eat it.” ” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Okay.”Lawyer si nodded.

Zhao Xueyin sent lawyer si out of the door.

“When she came back, it was still snowy, but now it was snowing heavily. ”

“Si lui stopped in his tracks. “I’ll send you here. It’s cold outside, you should go back quickly.” ”

“Zhao Xueyin nodded and reminded him, “It’s a snowy day and your vision isn’t good. Drive safe.” ”

“Si lui smiled and said, “I will, don’t worry.” ”

“Seeing Si Lui’s back disappear under the sky full of snow, Zhao Xueyin turned around and went back into the house. ”

“When she returned to the hall, Zhao Xueyin’s expression was obviously not good, “Dad! Didn’t I say that I won’t marry anyone other than Master Wu? What are you trying to do? I’m begging you, please don’t be a couple anymore! I’m really under a lot of pressure! I don’t even know how to face brother Si!” ”

Father Zhao slammed the cup on the table. “What? Are you trying to teach me how to do things again?”

“”Dad, that’s not what I meant.”Zhao Xueyin did not know how to explain. “I just feel that you’re making me look bad!” ”

“Father Zhao’s expression was also very ugly, “Who doesn’t know how to dream! ! You also want to marry Master Five, and she also wants to marry Master Five. Can Master Five marry all of you! ! I’m doing this for your own good! “If Master Wu doesn’t like you, you still have a way out! “I watched Ah Lui grow up with my own eyes! “He’s more than enough for you! “Don’t look like you’ve been wronged!” ”

“Who doesn’t want power and wealth?”?

Father Zhao also hoped that Zhao Xueyin could marry Master Wu as she wished.

But what if Master Wu didn’t like Zhao Xueyin?

Then wouldn’t it be a futile effort?

Too Much!

Father Zhao was simply too much.

“Zhao Xueyin was holding back her anger. It was neither up nor down, and it was very uncomfortable. ”

“Because she was not a boy, Zhao Xueyin had worked very hard since she was young. She worked hard to let Father Zhao see her. ”

Finally.

“Hard work paid off, and time gave her the best version of herself. ”

But in Father Zhao’s opinion.

She was still not as good as a boy.

“No matter how good a lawyer was, he was only the chairman of the Shunxi Financial Group. He had always worked for the Zhao family. ”

He was just a worker.

“From head to toe, which part of his body was worthy of her? ”

“But in Father Zhao’s eyes, it was actually her who was not worthy of a lawyer. ”

Wasn’t this deliberately trying to disgust people?

“After saying this, Father Zhao also felt that his words were a bit harsh. He looked at Zhao Xueyin.., then, he said, “I treat ah lui well for your sake. If anything happens to master five, Ah Lui will always be your escape route! “Moreover, I haven’t revealed the relationship between you two to Ah Lui yet. You two can still be friends for now. Ah Lui won’t affect you from pursuing master five! “What is this called again? “What fetus... ... ...” ”
