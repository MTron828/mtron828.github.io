“What’s wrong with the financial news?”

“Wang Jianguo continued, “The LIN Group successfully signed a contract with overseas ZAR company, and their funding loophole has been closed!””

“What?”Zhou Dawei’s face turned pale.

“The Lin Group not only closed the funding loophole, but also got the ZAR contract? Getting the ZAR contract meant opening up the foreign market.”

How did Lin Jincheng do it?

“Zhou Dawei took a few steps back, his mind blank.”

What to do?

What to do now?

“They divested in order to destroy the Lin Group, and then buy the Lin Group at a low price.”

“But now, not only did the Lin group have nothing, it even went to the next level.”

How could they accept this?

“If they had not withdrawn their investment, their value would have increased by more than ten times.”

But Now?

“Not only did they not get a single cent of the benefits, they had even come up empty-handed!”

“Sun Zuocheng walked in front of Zhou Dawei and said, “What should we do now? Brother Zhou, you were the one who suggested withdrawing our investment back then. Now that something has happened, you should think of a way!””

Think of a way?

What could he do now?

“He couldn’t let him go back to Lin Jincheng with a straight face. Even if he went back with a straight face, Lin Jincheng would never forgive him!”

“If time could be reversed, he would definitely not do such a stupid thing!”

...

On the other side.

“After Feng Xianxian learned that the LIN Group had successfully signed the contract with Zar, she knew that Lin Jincheng would never compromise with Old Lady Lin again.”

There was only one way in front of her now.

She had to get Old Lady Lin to sign the share concession letter and give her 50% of the shares of the LIN Group.

Thinking of this.

Feng Xianxian took out the two bottles of medicine.

“Everyone knew that Old Lady Lin liked her very much. If something really happened to Old Lady Lin and she left behind the share concession letter, outsiders would not suspect anything.”

“As long as no one died, the police would not file a case.”

“If these two bottles of medicine were taken separately, they would be a good medicine for the illness.”

“If they were taken together, it would cause the patient to have a stroke, and the cause would not be found.”

This was too tempting for Feng Qianxian.

“After all, a stroke would cause the loss of speech.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Old Lady Lin could not even speak, so how could she not be at her mercy?”

Thinking of this.

Feng Xianxian narrowed her eyes.

Ten minutes later.

“Feng Xianxian held a cup of red date water and walked into the bedroom. “Grandma, are you still awake?””

“Old Lady Lin leaned against the headboard of the bed, her face full of worry.”

“The matter had not been resolved, so how could she fall asleep now?”

“Feng Xianxian handed the cup in her hand to Old Lady Lin. “Grandma, this is red date water. It can help you sleep.””

“Old Lady Lin took the cup. “Xianxian, it’s really hard for you to take care of an old lady like me every day.””

“”You’re My Grandma. It’s my duty to take care of you.”Feng Xianxian continued, “Drink this red date water while it’s hot. It Won’t have any effect if it’s cold.””

“Okay.”Old Lady Lin nodded and drank up the red date water in one go.

Feng Xianxian looked at the empty cup and a glimmer flashed across her eyes.

She had avenged Feng Qianhua!

Just you wait!

This old woman was about to be punished.

Feng Xianxian chatted with old Mrs. Lin for a while.

“But strangely, after old Mrs. Lin drank the red date water, she did not have any abnormal reaction. Instead, she became more and more interested.”

Could it be...

Gao Di was lying to her?

Or could it be that the effect would only be seen tomorrow morning?

“Feng Xianxian narrowed her eyes and smiled. “Grandma, it’s getting late. I Won’t disturb your rest. You should go to bed early.””

“”Okay.”Old Lady Lin continued, “Xianxian, you should go to bed early too.””

“I know.”

“Feng Xianxian originally thought that she would see a paralyzed old lady Lin in bed the next morning, unable to speak.”

“However, she did not expect that not only was Old Lady Lin unharmed, she even started to make breakfast.”

“Seeing Feng Xianxian get up, Old Lady Lin smiled and said, “Xianxian, you’re up. Quickly brush your teeth, wash your face, and eat.””

“A puzzled look flashed across Feng Xianxian’s eyes and disappeared in a flash. “Grandma! I can make breakfast! How can I let you do it! You Go to the dining room, leave this to me!””

“Actually, Old Lady Lin was feeling a little uncomfortable today.”

“She had felt light-headed ever since she woke up in the morning. However, when she thought about how Feng Qianxian had to make breakfast for her every morning, Old Lady Lin’s heart ached terribly. She endured the discomfort in her body and planned to make breakfast for Feng Qianxian as well.”

“”It’s fine, Qianxian. Isn’t it just making breakfast? Quickly go brush your teeth and wash your face,”said Old Lady Lin with a smile. “Dinner will be ready soon.””

Feng Xianxian glanced at Old Mrs. Lin and quietly went to brush her teeth and wash her face.

“After breakfast, Feng Xianxian continued, “Grandma, I have something to do. I Won’t be back for lunch. I’ll come back and have dinner with you tonight.””

Old Mrs. Lin nodded. “Go do your thing. Don’t worry about me.”

“Not long after Feng Xianxian left, Old Mrs. Lin was ready to go out for a walk and also go to Beijing University.”

She had to look for Lin Ze.

“Lin Ze was her grandchild. Lin Jincheng could ignore her biological mother, but Lin Ze could not ignore her biological grandmother.”

“Just as she went downstairs, old Mrs. Lin saw a familiar figure.”

It was Feng Xianxian.

“Feng Xianxian stood under the camphor tree, holding her phone. It seemed that she was talking to someone. In order not to disturb Feng Xianxian, old Mrs. Lin deliberately slowed down her footsteps and walked in that direction.”

“Feng Xianxian had her back to Old Lady Lin. Because she deliberately slowed down her footsteps, Feng Xianxian did not know that Old Lady Lin was right behind her. Old Lady Lin reached out her hand, wanting to Pat Feng Xianxian on the shoulder, at this moment, Feng Xianxian suddenly spoke.”

Old Lady Lin’s hand also stopped in mid-air at this moment.

“”Miss Gao, why is it that after I gave the Lin family’s old woman the medicine, not only is she fine, she even has the energy to make breakfast? Didn’t you say that this medicine can paralyze a person with a stroke?””

“I gave it to her last night.”

“Mixed with red date water!”

She drank the medicine?

Paralyzed with a stroke?

Make Breakfast?

Red date water?

“Upon hearing these words, Old Mrs. Lin’s face instantly turned deathly pale. Her outstretched hand trembled as she retracted it.”

“Feng, Feng Xianxian poisoned her?”
