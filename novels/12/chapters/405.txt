He did not care about old feelings at all.

“Now that Shen Rong was poisoned by gas, she deserved it! ”

Oh?

“Even in his dreams, Li Qiandong did not expect Zhou Xiang’s reaction to be so calm. ”

He also did not expect Zhou Xiang to be so cold-blooded!

The dead were the most important.

“Now that he was dead, Zhou Xiang actually showed no reaction. ”

To think that Mu Yourong was so considerate of the Cen family.

Heartless!

Truly too heartless!

“Li Qiandong could no longer contain the anger in his heart, “Aunt Xiang! How can you be so heartless? No matter what, yourong is fifth brother’s fiancée! Now that Auntie has passed away, are you not sad at all? Are You not sad at all?” ”

“Zhou Xiang had always been a person with a good temper, but when she heard these words, she immediately flew into a rage. “That’s what they deserve! It’s retribution!” ”

It just so happened that old Madam Cen came down from upstairs. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Seeing Zhou Xiang in such a rage, she turned to look at the servant beside her. “What’s wrong? who called?” ”

“”From the sound of it, it seems to be young master Li,”the servant said. ”

Li Qiandong?

“Old Lady Cen was so angry that she snatched the microphone from Zhou Xiang’s hand, “You son of a bitch, what are you trying to do? If you’re dead, so be it! If you’re dead, it’s their retribution! The heavens are watching! There’s a god three feet above you! Do you think I’m a Holy Mother White Lotus? Someone from the Mu family died, and you want me to forgive that Little White Lotus? Let me tell you! Impossible!” ”

Although these words were a little cold and heartless.

But Old Lady Cen had never been a person who had the heart of a mother.

She remembered clearly how the Mu clan had treated her back then!

Li Qiandong was so angry that his entire body was trembling.

“He had never expected that now that Shen Rong was dead, Old Lady Cen would actually say such hurtful words! ”

“”Old Lady, aren’t your words a little overboard? Back then, Uncle Cen and the Mu family had such a deep relationship, how could you forget it so easily?”Li Qiandong continued, “Your most important matter now is to take Yourong over! Yourong is, after all, the only bloodline uncle Mu has left in this world!” ”

Only in this way could the CEN family make up for their misunderstanding of Mu Yourong.

“”I’ll Pick Your Grandpa Up! Idiot, let me tell you! The heavenly axiom is good for reincarnation, but who can the heavens bypass! Helping the wicked! You will also have your retribution!”After saying this, old Mrs. Cen was so angry that she threw the phone down. ”

“”Mom, Are You Alright?”Zhou Xiang asked carefully. ”

Old Mrs. Cen clutched her chest. “The Li family is really getting worse with each generation!”

“Li Qiandong was naturally not feeling well after old Mrs. Cen hung up on him, but when he called again, the line was already busy. ”

“At this moment, a Maybach slowly drove over. ”

It was Cen Shaoqing’s car.

Li Qiandong immediately ran over to stop the car. “Fifth brother!”

Cen Shaoqing slowly rolled down the car window. “What’s the matter?”

Li Qiandong told Cen Shaoqing about Shen Rong’s death from poisoning.

“When he heard this, Cen Shaoqing’s tone was indifferent. “Does this have anything to do with me?” ”

“Li Qiandong looked at Cen Shaoqing just like that, his eyes filled with regret, “Fifth brother! No matter what, Miss Mu was once your fiancée! Now that Auntie has passed away and uncle is still in prison, you can’t leave Miss Mu alone no matter what! She needs you now!” ”

Cen Shaoqing held the Buddhist beads in his hand and looked up at Li Qiandong with a hint of ruthlessness in his eyes. “Are you going to continue being so stupid?”

Li Qiandong clenched his fists so tightly that his eyes were red with excitement. “Fifth brother! The person who can’t see the truth of reality right now is you!”

“Mu Yourong was so good, so why couldn’t Cen Shaoqing see it! ! ”

It was truly a pity for Mu Yourong’s deep affection.

“At this moment, a head popped out from the car window, “Qiandong! Don’t be silly! Quickly wake up! That Mu Yourong is acting with you! She’s a white lotus flower in the prime of time! Would a truly good girl pretend to be someone else? Why don’t you understand such a simple principle?” ”

“Pretend?”A mocking smile flashed across Li Qian Dong’s eyes. “It was clearly ye Zhuo who pretended to be yourong! It was yourong who was kind-hearted and didn’t want to argue with her!”

He ziteng only wanted to give Li Qian dong a slap to wake him up!

It was really too infuriating!

“The truth was clearly right in front of him, yet he had to act Smart! ”

“Sooner or later, he would tie his own hands! ”

“This is a video of my idol racing with me yesterday! Take a look at who was the person who race last time! Say that my idol is pretending to be Mu Yourong? How Big Is Your Face!”

“With that, he ziteng threw a USB drive to Li Qiandong. ”

The driver started the engine and left.
