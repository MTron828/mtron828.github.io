“”Okay, put it here,”ye Zao said. ”

“Wen Zhi put the document on the table and turned to leave. Before he left, he took a look at the document that ye Zao had signed yesterday. ”

“The document was still on the spot. With one look, it was obvious that ye Zao had not read it. ”

“However, it was normal. Ye Zao was so busy right now, how could he have time to read the document. ”

Everything that happened on Mars was being monitored by Mi Jiadi.

“Looking at everything from the perspective of God, Mi Jiadi let out a sigh of relief. ”

It seemed that ye Zao had run out of ideas!

“After learning all the news on Mars, MI Jiadi immediately ordered Kevin to announce the bet agreement. ”

“Kevin was already prepared. Now, he was only waiting for Mi Jiadi’s words. When he heard the news, Kevin was very excited. ”

Soon.

“Soon, country C would be able to obtain the right to use the base! ”

Their country C would no longer have to look down on the Chinese people.

“The moment the betting agreement came out, the whole world was in an uproar. ”

No one had expected that ye Zhuo would actually sign a betting agreement with country C.

“The betting agreement stated that if the OASIS project failed, the right to use country C’s base would be returned unconditionally. At the same time, the right to use the space carrier and the right to use China’s scientific research base would also belong to country C. ”

“If the OASIS project was successful, country C would forever be a vassal of China and bow down to China! ”

“[ it’s over, it’s over. These YCS have no choice. Not only will they lose the bases on both sides, they will also lose the right to use the aircraft mothership! ] ”

[ YC is too scary. She even signed such an agreement! is she that confident in herself? ]

[ I also find it unbelievable! ]

“[ it makes my blood boil. After such a long time, our country C has finally won a round! ] ”

[ what is this called? Retribution! Who asked YC to take away our base so mercilessly back then! ]

“After the betting agreement was released, the people who were shocked were not only the bystanders, but also the people on Mars. ”

“Especially Dr. Zhang. When he heard the news, he immediately ran to Ye Zao’s office and asked, “Miss Ye, when did you sign the betting agreement?” ”

“It would have been fine if it was under normal circumstances, but the current situation was not in their favor. ”

“After all, the OASIS project had no chance of coming back from the dead! ” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Were they really going to watch C Nation do nothing

Ye Zhuo frowned slightly. “I’ve never signed this agreement.”

“”That’s C nation’s conspiracy!”Dr. Zhang was very angry. “Miss Ye, you have to quickly issue a statement to clarify this matter.” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Dr. Zhang continued, “C nation’s people are really too sinister and cunning. Miss Ye, hurry up and issue a statement. The entire Internet has exploded! We must immediately crush C Nation’s conspiracy!” ”

“”Okay.”Ye Zhuo continued, “You go out first. I will settle this matter.” ”

“Okay.”Professor Zhang nodded.

“After Professor Zhang went out, Ye Zhuo began to issue a statement denying that he had signed the bet agreement. ”

“Regarding this matter, C nation had long been prepared. ”

“Since they had decided to release the agreement, there were many ways to prove that this agreement was signed by Ye Zhuo. ”

“Moreover, this agreement was personally signed and sealed by Ye Zhuo himself. ”

“Kevin smashed one piece of evidence after another, and every piece of evidence gave ye Zhuo no chance to refute. ”

“After the evidence was uploaded, the international network was once again in an uproar. ”

[ what kind of Technology Big Shot is YC? He doesn’t even dare to admit that he signed the agreement! ]

“[ if I were YC, I wouldn’t admit it either. After all, this bet agreement isn’t beneficial to China at all! Instead, it would implicate China in losing its base and the Space Mothership! ] ”

[ she dares to do it but doesn’t dare to accept it. YC is really a disgrace to the Chinese! ]

“[ I’m also a little speechless. As a technology tycoon, she actually didn’t keep her word. Don’t you feel disgusted? Especially in front of the entire world. Does she think that the bet agreement is Child’s play? ] ”

“”I knew long ago that this YC had run out of ideas. As long as she’s a little smarter, she wouldn’t have gotten to this point!”! “How many people in this world can create a lightspeed space mothership?”? “YC can totally rely on this glory for her entire life, Okay?”? “But YC insisted on going off the rails and even tried to conquer Mars!” ”

“The analysis above is very reasonable. The reason why YC has become like this is related to her lack of self-awareness. She’s just too pretentious!”

[ now we just have to wait for China to hand over the right to use the base and the space carrier! ]
