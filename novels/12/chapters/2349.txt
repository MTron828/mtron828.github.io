It must be very beautiful.

“Go and dream.”Ye Zao walked over and pinched Cen Shaoqing’s waist. “There’s everything in the dream.”

“Don’t pinch your waist all the time.”Cen Shaoqing pulled him into his arms and his tone became low.

Ye Zao raised his eyes slightly and met his eyes. “Why?”

“Cen Shaoqing lowered his head and his thin lips touched ye Zao’s ear. He said slowly, “Because...”other than the word ‘because,’he lowered the last word very, very low. ”

“The warm breath sprayed into ye Zao’s ears. Ye Zao, who had already gotten used to CEN Shaoqing’s closeness, immediately blushed. ”

Men were indeed not to be provoked.

“If they were provoked, they would be able to say anything. ”

“Ye Zao, who had regained his senses, immediately pushed Cen Shaoqing away. “Quickly go back and listen to the heart cleansing mantra a few more times!” ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded very seriously. “I think so too. What should I do! When do you think I can end the days of listening to the heart cleansing mantra?”

Ye Zao:”...”

A certain someone’s face was getting thicker and thicker.

He couldn’t afford to offend her.

“At this moment, the sound of footsteps came from outside. ”

“”Shaoqing, Zao Zao, it’s time to eat!”It was ye Shu’s voice. ”

“Cen Shaoqing looked back slightly and opened his thin lips. “Yes, Aunty. I’ll be right there.” ”

“”Okay.”Ye Shu continued, “Hurry up and come over. The food will be cold soon.” ”

“After saying that, Ye Shu turned around and left. ”

“Cen Shaoqing put down the things in his hands and walked over to put his arm around ye Zao’s shoulder. “Let’s Go Eat, leader.” ”

“Ye Zao followed Cen Shaoqing’s footsteps and continued, “Cen Shaoqing, when did you become like this?” ”

“Like what?”Cen Shaoqing asked in a low tone.

“Ye Zao said, “I remember that you used to be a very serious and serious person. How Come You Can Say Anything Now?”Just... ... It didn’t seem like Cen Shaoqing. ”

“Cen Shaoqing turned to look at ye Zao and said word by word, “Haven’t you heard of a saying?” ”

“What saying?”Ye Zao asked.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Love makes people improve.” ”

“In the past, he was indeed pure-hearted and didn’t want to think about anything. When he saw the lovers hugging each other on the street, he still didn’t understand. ”

He even questioned the existence of love.

But now...

He wished he could just put ye Zao directly into his pocket.

“Perhaps, this was the power of love. ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “You’ve also become quite glib. I didn’t expect you to be like this, Mr. Cen.” ”

“”I also didn’t expect you to be like this, Miss Ye,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“What’s wrong with me?”Ye Zao asked with some confusion.

“Cen Shaoqing lowered his voice and said, “Before I became your boyfriend, I didn’t expect you to be so soft and sweet.” ”

Perhaps the single dog who was not in a relationship could not understand Cen Shaoqing’s words.

Some things had to be experienced personally before they could be empathized.

“Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly and continued, “Of course, why don’t you take a look at who I am, Father?” ”

“Why do you always want to be my father?”This made CEN Shaoqing somewhat unable to understand.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “I have a secret that I’ve been hiding from you for a long time. Call Me ‘father’and I’ll tell you.” ”

“What secret?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“”Call me ‘father’first,”ye Zhuo said. ”

Cen Shaoqing hesitated for a moment.

“Ye Zhuo began to count down to three. “There’s no time to lose. Mr. Cen, you have to consider it carefully.” ”

“Just as ye Zao was about to count down to one, Cen Shaoqing broke through the barrier in his heart and called out, “Father.” ”

Ye Zao chuckled softly.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Can you tell me now?” ”

He was a little curious as to what secret ye Zao had kept from him for a long time.

“”Come closer,”ye Zao said. ”

Cen Shaoqing leaned forward slightly.

“Ye Zao said calmly, “You’re not my biological son.” ”

? ? ? ?

“Cen Shaoqing was stunned for a moment. When he saw that ye Zao was laughing so hard that he could not straighten his back, he finally realized that this person was trying to trick him. ”

Cen Shaoqing reached out his hand to grab ye Zao’s wrist. Ye Zao lifted his leg and ran away.

The noon sun shone on the two of them.

It was peaceful and quiet.

“Time passed very quickly. In the blink of an eye, it was the third day of the Lunar New Year. ”

“Thinking that Earth was too far away from the s galaxy, Lin Ze had to make some preparations after bringing his destination, so he prepared to set off on the third day of the Lunar New Year. ”

Accompanying him were ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing.

“Originally, ye Zhuo had planned to invite some good friends to attend Lin Ze’s wedding. Otherwise, the wedding would be too quiet. ”

“However, Lin Ze rejected such a proposal. He didn’t want to use his sister’s connections to support him. ”

“On the seventh day of the Lunar New Year, the interstellar shuttle successfully arrived at the s galaxy. ”

The eighth day of the Lunar New Year was the day of the wedding.

“Lin Ze did not have many friends in the s galaxy, so not many people came to attend his wedding. ”

Other Than Ye Han and Shi Qingcheng.

“However, Lin Ze did not care about these things. He wore a festive bridegroom’s robe and accompanied by ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing, he came to the Bai family to pick up the bride. ”

There were quite a number of relatives in the Bai family.

“However, they were all here to watch the show. ”

Grandfather Bai’s favorite granddaughter had married an earthling. Wouldn’t this be the biggest joke?

Bai Jingshu wore a pure white wedding dress and sat in front of the bed. The corners of her lips curled up slightly as she waited for Lin Ze to come and pick her up.

Bai Mo stood opposite Bai Jingshu. The corners of his lips also curled up slightly. He had finally let her see this day.

“From today onwards, Bai Jingshu would be like Lin Ze. From now on, she would only be a lowly earthling. ”

“Bai Sanfeng also came to attend the wedding. She had imagined sending Bai Jingshu off to get married countless times, but she had never imagined that it would be this scene. ”

“”Jingshu.”Bai Sanfeng walked in front of Bai Jingshu. “From the moment a woman is born, she only has two chances to change her appearance. Getting married is the last time. If you regret it now, I can make the decision for you.” ”Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates
