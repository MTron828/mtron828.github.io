“”Just wait and see,”said Li Sanzhu. ” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Over here.

Old Madam Li came all the way to Li Erzhu’s residence. She was so angry that her lungs were about to explode.

“Seeing her return, Li Erzhu and his wife immediately went up to her. “Mom, you’re back. How did it go?” ”

“Old Madam Li’s eyes were red as she repeated what had happened, “This son was raised in vain... he actually joined with outsiders to bully this old mother of mine. Was it easy for me to raise him after putting in so much effort? This is how he treats me!” ”

“The more old madam Li thought about it, the sadder she became. She cried so hard that she could not help herself. ”

She had raised a total of three sons in her lifetime.

“The eldest son had sacrificed his life for the country. Not even a complete corpse was left behind. The youngest son was the same as if he did not have one. He completely did not put her, this mother, in his eyes. ”

“The only one left was the filial and obedient second son, but something had happened to Li Shuyi again! ”

Why was her life so miserable!

Why couldn’t the heavens treat her better?

“”Mom, don’t be sad.”Li Erzhu continued, “The three pillars and the couple are not willing to help Shuyi. What about Shuyi? We can’t really let Shuyi go to jail!” ”

“Linda followed, “Yes, Mom. Please think of a way for us!” ”

Think of a way? Think of a way?

“Old Mrs. Li frowned. After a moment, she seemed to have thought of something and said, “Right, where is fifth Cen Now?” ”

“Linda said, “He should still be at the third house. Mom, what do you want to Do?” ”

“Old Mrs. Li wiped the tears off her face and said, “I’ll go find him personally!” ”

“No matter what, she was still an elder. Fifth Cen would definitely give her face. ”

“After all, fifth master Cen was still living in the Li family. ”

“Linda narrowed her eyes and thought the same thing as Old Mrs. Li, she smiled and said, “Mom, you’re right. I heard that fifth master Cen especially respects the elderly. You’re also Yueyue’s biological grandmother. The Master of our old Li family will definitely give you face!” ”

“Li Erzhu felt that this matter was a little unreliable. “Is, is this really okay?” ”

“Although he said so, he was still Cen Wuye. ”

“”Why Not!”Linda said, “Mom is already so old. Can Cen Wuye not give mom face?” ”

“Old Mrs. Li stood up from the sofa and continued, “This kind of thing should be done sooner rather than later. I’ll go now.” ”

“After saying that, old Mrs. Li turned around and left. ”

“Seeing his mother return, Li Sanzhu turned to look at Fang yinyue. “What did I say? Look, she’s Here!” ”

Fang yinyue covered the smile on her face. “She really is.”

“Old Lady Li walked all the way to the living room. From the way she looked, she seemed to have forgotten the words that she had just said about severing ties. “Let me ask you, where does fifth Cen Live?” ”

“Why are you asking this?”Li Sanzhu asked.

“Old Lady Li said, “If you’re not willing to plead for Shuyi, then I’ll go myself!” ”

“”Mom, can you stop fooling around?”Li Sanzhu said in great distress. ”

“At this moment, Fang yinyue stood up from the sofa and continued, “Mom, Fifth Master Cen and Miss Ye’s flight is at three in the afternoon. You’re just in time. If you come a little later, you won’t be able to see them.” ”

“After saying this, Fang yinyue turned to look at the housekeeper. “Housekeeper, bring old madam to Cen Wuye and Miss Ye’s courtyard.” ”

“”Okay.”The housekeeper stood up. “Old Madam, Please!” ”

Old Madam Li followed the housekeeper’s footsteps.

“After the two figures disappeared outside the door, Li Sanzhu said, “Yinyue, how can you let the housekeeper bring mother to Cen Wuye’s Place! Come, let’s quickly follow and take a look!” ”

“”There’s no need to go,”Fang yinyue said unhurriedly. “Someone like your mother should let Miss ye teach her a good lesson! Otherwise, she will take advantage of her seniority and look down on others!” ”

“”This, this...”Li Sanzhu frowned slightly. “Will this work?” ”

“”Don’t worry, it’ll be fine.” ”

“The housekeeper brought old madam Li to the plum garden. “Old Madam, this is where Cen Wuye and Miss Ye Live.” ”

“”Alright, I understand.”Old Madam Li nodded. She tidied up her clothes and walked forward. ”

The door was closed. Old Madam Li reached out and knocked on the door.

“A moment later, a cold voice came from inside the room. “Come in.” ”

Old Madam Li pushed the door open and entered.

“The moment she entered, she saw a young man and woman playing chess on the couch by the window. ”

“The girl was wearing a white one-piece dress. She was sitting cross-legged there. Her face was exquisite, and she exuded an immortal aura. ”

“The man was dressed in a black, retro robe with a black chess piece in one hand and a string of bright red Buddhist beads in the other. ”
