Chapter 144: 084: Retribution for evil. Lin Ze came to yunjing! 3

“Go ahead.”

Ye Shu continued, “Do you think it’s too late to learn English at your mother’s age?”

“You want to learn English?”Ye Zhuo was a little surprised.

She had thought that ye Shu would ask about what had happened to the Ye family.

It seemed that her mother had really let it go.

Ye Shu nodded.

She wanted to learn English.

In the past, she had never thought that English was important. It was only last week that she received a few foreign clients.

Facing foreign clients, she was like an illiterate.

She didn’t understand anything.

She couldn’t even understand a simple word. Fortunately, there were two students from a foreign language school sitting at the table next to her.

Therefore, ye Shu wanted to use her free time to learn English.

Ye Zhuo raised his head to look at Ye Shu. “Mom, as long as you want to learn, it’s not too late, no matter what age you are.”

“Really?”Ye Shu was a little surprised.

She was already thirty-nine.

She had thought that it was a hopeless matter, but she didn’t expect that she could actually learn it.

Ye Zhuo nodded. “I’ll go to the bookstore to buy some learning materials for you later. Then, I’ll look for a foreign teacher online to conduct one-on-one tutoring.”

“Okay.”

After eating, Ye Zhuo went to the nearby Xinhua Bookstore.

She bought some basic teaching materials.

Then, she used the software to find a very reliable online teaching method.

Ye Shu was a person who was eager to learn. Not only did she learn, but she also learned very seriously.

At present, the restaurant was not open for business, and she had nothing to do at home. Therefore, she paid more money to change the one-day class to three classes a day.

Three days later.

Ye Shu learned simple spoken English. In order to learn it faster, Ye Shu suggested that ye Zao also use English to talk to her in daily communication. Occasionally, he would not talk to her or say something wrong, ye Zao could still correct her in time.

When Ye Sen came back, he heard ye Shu talking to ye Zao in English. He said in surprise, “Sister! When did you learn English?”

“I just learned it. I only know a little! Zao Zao is really amazing!”Although ye Shu had just started to learn English, she was shocked by Ye Zao’s pronunciation!

Ye Zao’s pronunciation was even more standard than that of a foreign teacher!

Ye Sen asked curiously, “Sister, why did you learn English?”

“Because foreigners always come to the restaurant to eat. English is an international common language. There’s no harm in learning it.”

Ye Zhuo took the opportunity to continue, “Why don’t you learn one too, uncle? Now that the express delivery company is getting better and better, one day it will be international. When that time comes, you, as the boss of the company, can’t even speak English!”

Ye Sen was very talented in business.

In just a few months, not only did he bring the company back on track, but he also made it flourish.

It was only a matter of time before it became international!

“I can hire a translator,”ye Sen said.

Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly. “Nowadays, some translators are very bad, and there are many who refer to a deer as a horse!”

“Zao Zao, you’re exaggerating!”Ye Sen did not think much of it. “How could I encounter such a bad translator?”

Ye Sen had always believed in it. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

In this world, there were more good people than bad people.

“Uncle, I don’t know if you’ve heard of this saying, but the business world is like a battlefield. What if the translator is bribed by your competitor and the list is snatched away by another company, or important secrets are leaked to another company? What would you do then?”

The business world was like a battlefield!

The slightest carelessness could result in eternal hatred.

What ye Zao said was not an exaggeration at all.

After saying that.., ye Zao continued, “Uncle, once you have learned the knowledge, it will be yours. No one can snatch it away from you! Besides, this won’t waste much of your time. You just need to take out one or two hours a day to learn it!”

As he said that, Ye Sen wavered.

He suddenly felt that what ye Zao said made sense.

If the translator he hired was a commercial spy, it would be too late to regret it.

There were some things that needed to be prevented.

His eldest niece was still the best!

She knew so much at such a young age!

Many times, ye Sen even felt that he was not ye Zao’s uncle.

Ye Zao seemed to be his elder instead!

“Zao Zao, why don’t you make an appointment with a foreign teacher for me too?”Ye Sen said.

Ye Zao smiled slightly. “Uncle, have you thought it through?”

Ye Sen nodded. “I have!”

Ye Zao returned to his room and took out a few books for ye Sen. “These are the books I bought for my mother the last time. I specially bought an extra copy for you to read! I’ll send you the contact details of the foreign teacher in a while. You can talk to him yourself.”
