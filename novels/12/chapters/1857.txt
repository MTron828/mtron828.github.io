Chapter 1858: 379: I was stunned! 1

Translator: 549690339

The entire grassland belongs to Li Yueyue’s family?

“Hearing this, Ouyang Nai was stunned. ”

She couldn’t tell what expression she had on her face.

“Currently, the beef was 50 yuan per catty, and each consumption cow was worth about 45,000 yuan. If Li Yueyue’s family raised 1,000 consumption cows, it would be worth 40 million! ”

“But in the entire grassland, how many more than 1,000 consumption cows? ”

“Raising 10,000 was more than enough. ”

“Most importantly, not only did Li Yueyue’s family raise cattle, but they also raised sheep in the entire grassland. In this way, the Li family’s assets were at least over a billion! ”

This was too terrifying!

Ouyang Nai only had two words in her heart.

She was lying.

Li Yueyue was definitely lying.

“Previously, Ouyang Nai had seen Li Yueyue’s parents in the video. Their clothes were shabby and their faces were sallow and thin. How did they look like a billionaire? ”

“Today, this boss Li was tall and strong. His face was shiny. One look and one could tell that he was a nouveau riche! ”

No.

That was not right. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Boss Li could not be Li Yueyue’s father.

“In just a few seconds, Ouyang Nai’s thoughts had already turned a thousand times. ”

“Then why did you lie to me before?”Ouyang Nai asked.

“”What did I lie to you about?”Li Yueyue continued, “I’ve always said that my family raised cattle.” ”

“From the beginning to the end, Li Yueyue had never hidden her family background. ”

This included meeting her parents through a video call.

It was just that she had met Li Yueyue’s godparents at that time.

“Godparents did not like to dress up, so they let godparents leave the country to test Ouyang Nai at the same time. ”

She did not expect that this test would make Ouyang Nai reveal her fox tail.

“Now, when Li Yueyue saw Ouyang Nai again, all that was left was disgust. ”

It was very disgusting.

“After hearing this, Ouyang Nai was stunned. ”

Yes.

Li Yueyue was right. She had always said that her family raised cattle...

“However, what Ouyang Nai did not expect was that Li Yueyue’s family actually raised an entire grassland of cattle and sheep. ”

“I...”Ouyang Nai stammered.

Li Yueyue glanced at Ouyang Nai and did not say anything more. She turned around and left.

“Ouyang Nai looked at Li Yueyue’s back and wanted to say something, but in the end, she couldn’t say anything. ”

“”Xiaonai! What are you doing!”Ouyang Yuan trotted over. “That was boss Li’s daughter just now, right? Do you know her?” ”

“Ouyang nai gulped and continued, “Then, is that really boss Li’s Daughter?” ”

“”Nonsense! How could it be fake?”Ouyang Yuan continued, “Don’t you realize that boss Li’s daughter looks very similar to boss Li?” ”

So...

Li Yueyue was really boss Li’s Daughter?

Their family had an entire grassland of cattle and sheep?

Their family was a billionaire!

How could this be?

“At this moment, Ouyang Yuan seemed to have thought of something, he continued, “Oh right, you seem to be an alumnus of Boss Li’s daughter, right? “Let me tell you, Xiao Nai, in the future, when you look for friends, look for them according to the standards of Boss Li’s daughter. Boss Li has said that whoever marries his daughter will use half of the grassland’s cattle and sheep as a dowry!” ”

That was half of the grassland’s cattle and sheep!

It was worth over ten million!

Whoever marries Li Yueyue home would be equivalent to marrying a gold mine.

There was no need to work hard in the future. He could just sit at home and count the money.

“Hearing this, Ouyang Nai’s heart was even more uncomfortable. ”

“It was his mistake to treat the pearl as a fish’s eye. He had missed out on Li Yueyue, who was a fair, rich, and beautiful woman! ”

What should he do now?

Ouyang Nai was very regretful now. He was so regretful that the ground turned green!

He should not have broken up with Li Yueyue.

He should not have looked down on Li Yueyue.

“If he had not broken up with Li Yueyue, then half of the grassland would have been his! ”

“Seeing Ouyang na like this, Ouyang Yuan frowned and said, “What’s wrong? Are you not feeling well?” ”

“”No, no,”ouyang na continued, “Dad, actually, Li Yueyue is my girlfriend.” ”

“Hearing this, Ouyang Yuan’s eyes lit up. He even thought that he was hearing things. ”

Li Yueyue was actually Ouyang Nai’s girlfriend!

Oh My God!

“Really?”Ouyang Yuan asked.

Ouyang Nai nodded.

Of course it was true!

“Ouyang Yuan immediately said, “Then let’s hurry over now and say Hello Again! Boss Li is in the VIP lounge over there. They are flying a private plane over. If we are late, it will be too late!” ”

“Wait a minute.”Ouyang Nai held Ouyang Yuan’s hand.

“What’s Wrong?”Ouyang Yuan turned around.

“Ouyang NAI’s expression was a little bitter. “We, we have already broken up.” ”

“Thinking of the breakup, Ouyang Nai wanted to beat that stupid herself to death. ”
