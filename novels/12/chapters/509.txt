Lin Jincheng turned a deaf ear. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Old Lady Lin was so angry that her breathing quickened and she felt extremely uncomfortable.

Unfilial Son!

“No wonder people said that one would forget one’s mother after marrying a wife. Now, Ye Shu had not entered the house yet and Lin Jincheng was treating her like this. If Ye Shu entered the house, what would happen to him? Without even thinking about it, it was obvious that ye Shu must have instigated something behind the scenes!”

Slut!

“If it was Feng Qianhua, she would definitely not gossip in front of Lin Jincheng.”

“Feng Qianhua had her education, education, upbringing, and family background. Other than being able to sow discord and gossip, what else would ye Shu Do?”

No!

She must not allow such a woman to enter the Lin family.

“She had already drunk the health-preserving soup, but old Mrs. Lin could not help but cough loudly.”

“Feng Qianhua quickly sat down to soothe Old Mrs. Lin, “Aunt Lin, brother Jin Cheng did not do it on purpose. Don’t be angry. It was not easy for him to find his biological daughter, so it is normal for him to be emotional. After all, she is his biological daughter.””

“”But I’m still his biological mother! Without me, would he be where he is now?”Old Mrs. Lin was heartbroken. “How did this child become like this? He can’t tell the good from the bad! He mistook a broken shoe for a treasure!””

“Feng Qianhua continued to persuade Old Mrs. Lin, “Aunt Lin, don’t say that. Sister Ye Shu isn’t that kind of person. It was because she carried the wrong child that there was such a big misunderstanding. No matter what happens to that child, she’s still your biological granddaughter, brother Jin Cheng’s biological daughter.””

“This sentence made old madam Lin realize that something was wrong. She looked up at Feng Qianhua. “What’s wrong with that child? Qianhua, are you hiding something from me?””

“Feng Qianhua smiled and said, “No, you’re thinking too much.””

Old Madam Lin grabbed Feng Qianhua’s hand. “Qianhua! Tell me honestly! What’s wrong with that child! ?”Her instincts told her that this matter was very abnormal!

There must be something wrong with that child.

“Feng Qianhua said with some difficulty, “My family has a relative in Yun Jing. I’ve heard of that child before, but at that time, I didn’t know that she was brother Jin Cheng’s biological daughter...””

“Speaking up to this point, Feng Qianhua became more hesitant and her expression was somewhat meaningful.”

Old Madam Lin was extremely anxious and her face turned pale. “Hurry up and tell me! What’s going on?”

“Feng Qianhua said hesitantly, “Actually, this matter is not a secret in Yun Jing. You can get someone to inquire about it...””

“Old Mrs. Lin shouted, “Butler!””

The Butler walked in from outside.

“Old Mrs. Lin continued, “Go and investigate! Find out what’s going on with that child in Yun Jing!””

“Okay.”The butler nodded.

Feng Qianhua’s eyes flashed with mockery.

“If Old Lady Lin were to find out that her biological granddaughter was an idiot who knew nothing and had a bad reputation in Yun Jing, what would Old Lady Lin Think?”

Would she still acknowledge Ye Zhuo as her granddaughter?

“After all, compared to Feng Qianxian, Ye Zhuo was just a scumbag!”

She couldn’t even compare to a strand of Feng Qianxian’s hair.

Feng Qianhua felt that her decision back then was not wrong. She only regretted not adding more medicine back then.

Now she was just an idiot.

She should have made an idiot out of an idiot!

“With this in mind, Feng Qianhua narrowed her eyes. A vicious glint flashed across her eyes and disappeared in a flash.”

“Old Lady Lin was an extremely shameless person. She wanted to be first in everything. It was obvious with her toes. Compared to the extremely stupid ye Zao, she would definitely choose the outstanding Feng Qianxian!”

“Soon, the butler came in with the information he had found.”

“Old Lady Lin was furious when she saw the information. She was a stubborn idiot who could not read a few words and knew nothing. Compared to Feng Qianxian who was good at everything, Ye Zhuo did not even have the right to give her the foot-washing water!”

“Feng Qianxian was a talented woman, Chang ‘e in the middle of the Moon. Ye Zhuo could not even be considered a mud ball.”

Having such a granddaughter was worse than not having one.

It was simply a disgrace!

“But just because she had a piece of identification paper, she didn’t even have a reason to refuse.”

Old Lady Lin was so angry that her facial features were about to turn ferocious. “Ye Shu that B * Tch! She actually taught my biological granddaughter to be like this! What right does she have to be a mother!”

“If a daughter didn’t teach, it was a mother’s fault.”

“In Old Lady Lin’s eyes, this was ye Shu’s fault.”

Ye Shu was not worthy of being a mother at all.

Old Lady Lin’s reaction was within Feng Qianhua’s expectations. She quickly comforted her:

“”It’s said that knowledge determines one’s horizon. I heard that Sister Ye Shu’s educational level is not high. You Can’t blame her for not teaching her child well. As a mother, who doesn’t want their children to become successful? She has no choice!””
