“Although he was mentally prepared, when Cen Shaoqing saw the results, he still couldn’t accept it. ”

No expression could be seen on his cold face.

Only the last column of the report said.

Support the relationship between father and son.

“In other words, he and CEN Haifeng of S Galaxy were really father and son. ”

It had been more than ten years.

“Cen Haifeng was like a stone sinking into the ocean, and Zhou Xiang kept her body as jade for him. ”

“However, he had a home on the other side of the world and a beautiful wife ”

“”How is it?”Seeing that he didn’t say anything, Ye Zhuo asked. ”

“Here.”Cen Shaoqing handed the phone to Ye Zhuo.

“Ye Zhuo reached out to take the phone. After seeing the result clearly, he looked up at Cen Shaoqing. “Then what are you going to do now?” ”

Cen Shaoqing pursed his thin lips and said nothing.

“After a while, he continued, “Do you think I should tell my mother about this?” ”

Ye Zhuo hesitated.

“To Zhou Xiang, she was first a wife, then a daughter-in-law of the Cen family and the mother of her son. ”

“No matter what, a wife could not accept that her husband had a family outside. ”

“If she told Zhou Xiang, Zhou Xiang would definitely not be able to bear the blow. ”

“However, if she did not tell Zhou Xiang, it would be too unfair for Zhou Xiang ”

“After all, she had served Cen Haifeng and the Cen family for so many years, and in the end, she was actually kept in the dark. ”

“Not to mention Zhou Xiang, if it were anyone else, they would probably not be able to accept it. ”

He was caught between a rock and a hard place.

Ye Zhuo understood Cen Shaoqing’s current mood very well.

“After a moment, ye Zhuo raised his eyes slightly, then he said, “This matter must be told to Aunt Xiang and grandmother, but not now. The General Alliance must have other actions... let’s wait and see. Moreover, uncle may have some difficulties.” ”

“Speaking up to this point, ye zhuo paused and continued, “Why don’t we go to the General Alliance?” ”

“Although ye Zhuo did not know much about Cen Haifeng, she could tell from Cen Shaoqing’s words that CEN Haifeng was not the kind of Chen Shimei who was fickle and lusted after the powerful. ”

There must be a reason for this.

“”Let’s go to the General Alliance and investigate everything thoroughly. Then, we’ll come back and tell Aunt Xiang and Grandma about this news.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Okay. Then, when do we leave?” ”

“Not Now.”Ye Zhuo thought for a moment. “I’ll contact ye Han first and ask him to prepare everything in advance. Then we’ll go over.”

“Okay.”

“Ye Zhuo held Cen Shaoqing’s hand tightly, “Don’t worry. I remember Grandma said that the CEN men are very affectionate. Moreover, uncle and Aunt Xiang are so in love. If it weren’t for the force majeure factor, I believe uncle wouldn’t be like this.” ”

Cen Shaoqing didn’t want to believe it either.

“But now, the matter was right in front of him. ”

He didn’t know why Cen Haifeng didn’t contact his family for so many years.

“According to Ye Zhuo, he was now the Supreme Leader of the General Alliance. Could it be that no one could stop him from doing anything? ”

“Was it because he didn’t want to contact his family, or did he really have some difficulties? ”

Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads and felt a headache. He recalled the time when his father had just been in an accident.

At that time.

The Cen family was like a falling wall that everyone pushed down on. Anyone could bully them.

Some people mocked Zhou Xiang for being a hypocrite.

“However, even after experiencing such a difficult time, Zhou Xiang still did not want to abandon her family. She gritted her teeth, took her five children, and relied on the old lady of the Cen family. ” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“At this time, where was Cen Haifeng? ”

“He was in his arms, and he was making out with Duanmu Huangfei... ”

“”Zha Zha, what do you think his difficulties are?”Cen Shaoqing looked at Ye Zha. ”

“Ye Zha continued, “I did some research. There is an ancient forbidden spell in the General Alliance. People who are affected by the forbidden spell will forget the past. I think that uncle must have been affected by the forbidden spell.” ”

“What if he wasn’t affected by the Forbidden Spell?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“”He won’t be.”Ye Zhuo tiptoed to smooth the creases between his brows, he comforted him, “We have to think in a positive direction. We have to believe that uncle must have had his own difficulties. Look at how outstanding you are. As the saying goes, a tiger father does not have a dog son. How Bad Can Uncle Be?” ”

“”Not Necessarily.”CEN Shaoqing continued, “Man Jiangshan and Zhao Dan are a couple of bad characters, but you and man Wen are different from them.” ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Don’t think so extreme. Situations like mine are rare after all. “Besides, haven’t we gone to the General Alliance Yet? “Only when we reach the General Alliance will we know what’s going on. Don’t be in a hurry to put a hat on uncle’s head.” ”
