Chapter 179: 086: murder goes to jail! A giant in the business world! 7

ZY Company’s rise in the European and American markets had also given China technology a huge boost.

After all, even country P, a big technological country, could not produce an air-conditioner that could adjust the temperature.

“Who is the founder of ZY Company?”When he said that, Cen Shaoqing was also interested.

To be able to invent a human chip that could adjust the temperature, it was enough to show how terrifying this person’s strength was!

Li Qiandong continued, “ZY’s top executive officer is Zhao Yang, but Zhao Yang doesn’t have any shares. He’s just a hired professional CEO. Up until now, ZY’s real founder has never been seen in public! No one knows who he is or what his name is!”

Cen Shaoqing narrowed his eyes and continued, “Isn’t our company’s product for the next quarter focused on environmental protection? We can replace the one-time heating pack with a reusable heating chip.”

Li Qiandong’s eyes lit up. “Fifth brother, do you mean to cooperate with ZY technology company?”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

Li Qiandong said excitedly, “That’s great, fifth brother! I’ll talk to the R & D Department about this tomorrow!”Once he cooperated with ZY company, he might be able to meet the legendary founder!

At that time, he would definitely want to see what the legendary founder looked like!

Cen Shaoqing was expressionless and his expression was indifferent. No one knew what he was thinking.

On the other side.

When Old Mrs. Cen returned home, the first thing she told Zhou Xiang was that ye Zhuo was coming over as a guest.

......

“Xiang Xiang, my granddaughter-in-law is coming over to play tomorrow. Remember to be more enthusiastic!”

Hearing that, Zhou Xiang said excitedly, “Really? The legendary leaf is finally coming?”Zhou Xiang couldn’t wait to see what kind of fairy-like appearance that leaf had!

With medical skills and good looks, Zhou Xiang couldn’t imagine what kind of person would be so perfect.

“You are the leaf!”Old Lady Cen rolled her eyes at Zhou Xiang and continued, “Tomorrow, my granddaughter-in-law is coming. You are not allowed to call her leaf! If you scare my granddaughter-in-law away, I won’t let you off!”

“Don’t worry, Mom. I know what I’m doing! No matter what, she’s Your Old Savior. I’ll treat her well just based on this! Besides, do I look like a mean person to you?”

Old Mrs. Cen continued, “But don’t be too enthusiastic. If you scare my granddaughter-in-law away, you’ll lose more than you gain.”

Zhou Xiang quickly picked up her phone. “I also want to invite Zhuo Zhuo to come over tomorrow.”

She wanted to see who was more attractive when the two of them stood together!

Could it be that there was someone more attractive than ye Zhuo in this world?

Ye Zhuo quickly replied, “I’m sorry, Sister Zhou Xiang. I have an appointment tomorrow.”

An appointment?

Zhou Xiang’s face was full of disappointment. She frowned and said, “Why would I have an appointment?” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Old Mrs. Cen smiled and looked at Zhou Xiang. “I think it’s that Zhuo Zhuo who doesn’t dare to come, right? She must have been scared by my granddaughter-in-law! My granddaughter-in-law is so beautiful. It’s normal that she doesn’t dare to come!”

“Who said that! Zhuozhuo is very beautiful, okay!”Zhou xiang continued, “She really has a date!”

“Who knows if she really has a date!”Old Mrs. Cen snorted lightly. “Could it be that you are a worm in her stomach?”

In terms of eloquence, Zhou Xiang could never compare to old Mrs. Cen. She could only say, “Words don’t mean anything. When you see her next time, you’ll know how beautiful she is!”

Old Mrs. Cen snorted and continued, “Just you wait. Tomorrow, I’ll definitely make Shaoqing fall in love with Yezi! The kind that she won’t marry!”

Zhou xiang smiled and said, “Mom, let alone fall in love, it’s not even certain whether Shaoqing will stay at home obediently tomorrow.”

Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “Don’t worry, he will definitely not run around tomorrow!”

“Do you have a way?”

Old Mrs. Cen nodded.

Zhou xiang asked curiously, “Can you tell me about it?”

Old Mrs. Cen said mysteriously, “There’s no rush. You’ll know Tomorrow Morning.”

The next morning, the family of three sat at the dining table to eat.

Looking at the green vegetable leaves in Cen Shaoqing’s bowl and a few dry bread slices, old Mrs. Cen could not help but ask, “Shaoqing, do you really plan to be a vegetarian for the rest of Your Life?”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Don’t you want to eat meat?”Old Mrs. Cen picked up a piece of meat and waved it in front of Cen Shaoqing. “The meat is very fragrant! Do you want to eat it? If you want to eat it, I’ll give it to you!”
