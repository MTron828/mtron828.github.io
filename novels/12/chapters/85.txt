Chapter 86: 073: Going to the capital, the annual gala! 7

How could she be ye Zhuo!

It was simply impossible.

“I say,”Cen Shaoqing turned his eyes slightly and impatience appeared in his eyes. “I want you to send me Sitara’s streamer number.”

Li Qiandong did not dare to say anything else and immediately sent the streamer number to CEN Shaoqing.

He opened Sitara’s ID number.

Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly. “What’s with this cheating?”

Li Qiandong told him the whole process, “Fifth brother, I might have to disappoint you. Sitara did not win you with strength at all, but cheated! However, don’t be discouraged. Although Sitara cheated, Miss Mu is the real deal...”

“She didn’t cheat.”Cen Shaoqing directly interrupted Li Qiandong’s unfinished words.

Although CEN Shaoqing was not sure if that person was ye Zhuo or not.

But after playing chess with the other party for so long.

From the other party’s chess style, it could be seen that she was not the type of person to cheat.

Li Qiandong sighed. Cen Shaoqing usually looked like a smart person. Why was it that when it came to a critical moment, he could not recognize people clearly?

“Fifth brother, no matter how much I say now, you won’t believe me. Tomorrow night, you will be able to see the truth. At that time, Sitara will definitely not dare to come. However, you can play chess with Miss Mu.”

“Is she worthy?”

“Fifth brother, your prejudice against Miss Mu is too deep.”Li Qiandong sighed again.

However, tomorrow night, Cen Shaoqing would be able to see the truth.

...

Time quickly passed, and the next day arrived.

Miao Yin’s third anniversary party was very grand. Countless reporters were waiting to film, all wanting to get the latest news.

Mu Yourong arrived neither early nor late.

As the number one female anchor in the world, she was dressed to the nines today.

She wore a limited edition Chanel gown that sold for a million dollars.

She wore a crown studded with diamonds on her head, her long curly hair draped over her shoulders. Her shoulders were faintly discernible, and her face was covered in exquisite makeup. Every step she took was like a lotus flower, making all the female anchors present pale in comparison.

Seeing the envious gazes of the surrounding people, Mu Yourong’s lips curled up slightly.

She was born to be the most dazzling existence. How could these vulgar cosmetics compare to her?

“Yourong.”

Seeing Mu Yourong, du Ruo jogged over.

“Sister Du.”

Mu Yourong held du Ruo’s hand.

Du ruo continued, “Yourong, you’re finally here. I’ve been waiting for you for half a day. Let’s go. Director Li is over there. I’ll introduce you to him.”As the director of the wonderful sound platform, Du Ruo and Li Qiandong were very familiar with each other.

Hearing this, Mu Yourong’s face flushed a little. “It’s better not to. I’m not familiar with director Li either.”

“Won’t we be familiar after getting to know each other?”Du ruo continued, “When I told director Li about you just now, he was quite interested in you.”

Mu Yourong half-heartedly followed du Ruo to the audience stand.

Li Qiandong stood there.

On the seat behind him sat a man. He was holding a Buddhist bead in his hand and his long legs were crossed.

It was clearly a very casual movement, but it exploded with an imposing aura that made people unable to catch up to it.

The lights were very dim.

It was difficult to see his face clearly, but Mu Yourong recognized him immediately. This person was Cen Shaoqing.

She knew that Cen Shaoqing would definitely come to this party.

It seemed.

The day when Cen Shaoqing abused his wife for a moment and chased after the crematorium was not far away.

Mu Yourong held her head high and puffed out her chest. She maintained her best state and followed du Ruo to Li Qiandong’s side.

“Director Li, this is the My Rong I told you about, Miss Mu.”Du Ruo took the initiative to introduce her.

“Miss Mu, I’ve heard so much about you.”

The graceful and graceful Li Qiandong reached out his hand. “Director Li, you’re too kind. I’m just a nobody. Didn’t I just lose to our rookie on the same platform, Sitara?”

“Sita la cheated, so it can’t be considered a win.”

“There’s always someone better than you. It’s normal for me to lose,”Mu Yourong continued. “Miss Sita La asked me to play chess with her tonight. Who knows, she might win again.”

Li Qiandong looked at mu yourong, his eyes filled with admiration.

Mu Yourong was simply kinder than he had imagined.

Even at this time, she was still speaking up for someone who cheated.

Such a kind-hearted girl was really too rare in today’s society.

A smug look flashed across Mu Yourong’s eyes. Looking at Li Qiandong’s expression, she knew that Li Qiandong had already fallen head over heels for her.

What a pity.

Li Qiandong and Cen Shaoqing could not be compared.

A stepping stone could only be a stepping stone forever.

Li Qiandong continued, “Miss mu is too modest. Sitara doesn’t even dare to show her face, so how could she dare to play chess with you on the same stage?”

It was almost time for the live broadcast, but Sitara was not here yet. If this was not guilt, then what was it?

Mu yourong said, “Maybe she was delayed on the road? I think Miss Sitara doesn’t seem like the type of person who can’t be seen in the light.”

At this moment, du Ruo looked at her watch and continued, “Yourong, let’s go over there. We’re about to walk down the red carpet.”

Mu Yourong nodded and said goodbye to Li Qiandong.

Over three hundred female streamers were lining up to walk down the red carpet.

When Mu Yourong arrived, everyone immediately began to discuss.

After all, the cheating incident between Mu Yourong and Sitara had blown up so much that Sitara had even personally announced that they would participate in the gala and sent Mu Yourong an invitation to a PK.

Seeing that they were about to enter the red carpet segment, Sitara still did not come. She probably did not dare to come, right?

She was ugly and even cheated. If she came, it would only be embarrassing.

Not coming was the wisest move.

The live broadcast platform was also very exciting.

[ has Sitara Come Yet? ]

[ waiting for the red carpet segment to slap her in the face! ]

[ I’ve watched for a long time, but I haven’t seen anyone at the scene who looks like Sitara. If she really came, she would probably be an ordinary-looking nobody. She wouldn’t even be comparable to Rong Rong’s little finger. ]

“Hahaha! The cheating dog doesn’t dare to come ~”

“Disperse. If the cheating dog doesn’t come, I won’t be able to eat this melon.”

At this moment, the red carpet ceremony officially began.

The host stood on the stage, holding a microphone in her hand. “The first to enter is the host riding a big fish on a trip.”

The wonderful sound platform deliberately caused trouble, deliberately placing mu Yourong and ye Zao’s names at the last two.

After all, those with a lot of traffic were the last ones.

They probably knew that ye Zao did not dare to come, so ye Zao’s name was the last one.

“Next, let’s welcome our female streamer of the year, Miss My Rong!”

Mu Yourong brushed her long hair and leisurely walked towards the red carpet.

[ Ahhhh! She’s so beautiful! She’s so beautiful! ]

[ she’s so beautiful! ]

[ the next one is that cheating dog, right? ]

[ don’t worry, there won’t be any cheating dogs. Cheating Dogs won’t dare to come! ]

Mu Yourong walked onto the stage, signed her name on the advertising wall, took a photo, and then stood on the stage to wait for Sitara.

After all, she and Sitara still had a PK.

Although she knew that the clown who couldn’t be seen would definitely not dare to come, she still had to do what she had to do.

“The next person will be the newbie streamer that we are all looking forward to the most! Her name is: Sitara YC’s Ye! It is said that Sitara YC’s ye even sent an invitation to My Rong for a PK. For this, our platform has even specially set up a chess stage for the two streamers. I wonder if we will have the honor to see the two of you PK Live!” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Now, let’s Welcome Sitara YC’s Ye!”

After the host finished speaking, the red carpet was silent.

[ I knew that cheating dogs wouldn’t dare to come. ]

[ ugly bastard who died in the light! ]

[ disgusting! ]

After waiting for dozens of seconds, there was still no movement from the other end of the red carpet.

The host held the microphone and said, “It’s a pity! Our newbie host, Sitara YC’s Ye, is absent tonight...”

“I’m sorry that I’m late.”

A clear female voice interrupted the host’s unfinished sentence.

Hearing this, everyone turned to look at the other end of the red carpet.

They saw a tall figure walking over from the other end of the red carpet against the light
