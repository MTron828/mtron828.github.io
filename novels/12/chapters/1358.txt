“Xie wanqiu turned to look at Zhou Zuolong, “Old man, what if, I mean what if, what if something happens to me, you must not blame Xiang Xiang. Everything is fate. It has nothing to do with Xiang Xiang.” ”

Zhou Zuolong did not say anything.

Not Blame Zhou Xiang?

How could he not blame Zhou Xiang!

“If it was not for Zhou Xiang, Xie wanqiu would not have become like this. ”

“Xie wanqiu continued, “Old man, I’m talking to you! Didn’t you hear me?” ”

Zhou Zuolong nodded perfunctorily. “I heard you. I heard you. Do I dare not to listen to you?”

“Xie wanqiu smiled and said, “It’s good that you heard me. If you dare to argue with Xiangxiang, don’t blame me for ignoring you!” ”

Zhou Zuolong continued to nod.

“Not long after, Zheng Wanyin came back with food. ”

“After eating, Xie wanqiu fell asleep. ”

“”Yinyin,”Zhou Zuolong called Zheng Wanyin in a low voice. ”

Zheng Wanyin raised her head.

“Zhou zuolong whispered, “I’m going out for a while.” ”

“”Okay.”Zheng Wanyin nodded and stood up to send Zhou Zuolong out. “Grandpa, are you going to second aunt’s Place?” ”

“Yes.”

“Zheng wanyin continued, “Please don’t make things difficult for second aunt. Otherwise, when Grandma wakes up, I won’t be able to explain it to her.” ”

“After saying that, Zheng wanyin continued, “You and second aunt are biological father and daughter. You Can’t hurt the peace because of this.” ”

Zhou Zuolong looked at Zheng Wanyin and sighed softly.

“Just like what Xie Wanqiu said, Zheng Wanyin was good in everything except for being too kind. ”

“Zhou Xiang had treated her so well. If it had been anyone else, they would not have recognized Zhou Xiang as their second aunt. However, Zheng Wanyin did not. Not only did she not do so, she even spoke up for Zhou Xiang. ”

“Even if it was her biological niece, she probably could not do what Zheng Wanyin did. ”

“However, Zhou Xiang did not know how to cherish her. ”

“Seeing that Zhou Zuolong did not speak for a long time, Zheng Wanyin continued, “Grandfather?” ”

“Only then did Zhou Zuolong react. He smiled and said, “Don’t worry, I won’t make things difficult for your second aunt.” ”

“”That’s good.”After saying that, Zheng wanyin continued, “Grandpa, come back soon.” ”

“”Okay.”Zhou Zuolong nodded. “Go back quickly. If your grandmother wakes up later, she won’t be able to do it without anyone by her side.” ”

“Okay.”

Zheng Wanyin turned around and walked into the ward.

“Just as she closed the door, Xie wanqiu, who was on the bed, opened her eyes. She looked at Zheng Wanyin and said, “Your Grandpa Left?” ”

“Yes.”

The corners of Xie Wanqiu’s lips curled up.

“Although Xie Wanqiu did not hear the conversation between Zheng Wanyin and Zhou Zuolong, she could guess who Zhou Zuolong went to find. ”

“”Yinyin, just wait and see.”Xie wanqiu turned to look at Zheng Wanyin. ”

A shy look flashed across Zheng Wanyin’s face. “Grandma...”

That was Cen Shaoqing..

He was truly above all others.

“Xie wanqiu smiled and said, “When a man is older, he should get married. When a woman is older, she should get married. Why are you so shy?” ”

On the other side.

At the CEN residence.

“Zhou Xiang was sitting on the sofa, munching on melon seeds while watching television. ”

“At that moment, the butler walked in from outside the door. ”

“”Madam, Old Mister Zhou has arrived.” ”

Old Mister Zhou! ?

Zhou Zuolong had arrived!

What should she do?

Zhou Xiang was so frightened that her hands trembled. The melon seeds in her hands fell to the ground. She felt that she was hearing things. She raised her head to look at the butler in disbelief. “Who did you say is here?”

“The butler continued, “Old Mister Zhou.” ”

Zhou Xiang’s face turned pale.

She was really afraid of Zhou Zuolong. She had been afraid since she was young.

“When she was young, Zhou Xiang was afraid of the belt in Zhou Zuolong’s hands. When she grew up, although Zhou Zuolong no longer used the belt to whip her, the fear still remained. ”

“Zhou Xiang had expected Zhou Zuolong to come to denounce her after she and Xie wanqiu became like this. However, she did not expect Zhou Zuolong to come so quickly. ”

How long had it been?

“Just as Zhou Xiang was scared out of her wits, old Mrs. Cen’s voice sounded in the air, “The in-law is here?” ”

“Yes.”The housekeeper nodded.

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Then why are you still standing there? Quickly invite him in! Don’t neglect our honored guest!” ”

“Okay.”The housekeeper quickly walked out.

“Looking at the housekeeper’s back, Zhou Xiang swallowed and turned to look at Old Mrs. Cen. “Mom?” ”

Old Mrs. Cen patted Zhou Xiang’s hand. “I’m here. Don’t panic.”

“Okay.”Zhou Xiang tried hard to calm himself down. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Not long after, the housekeeper brought Zhou Zuolong in. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen smiled and welcomed him. “In-law, why didn’t you inform me that you were coming? I could have arranged for someone to pick you up at the airport.” ”

“Keeping Xie Wanqiu’s instructions in mind, Zhou Zuolonghu suppressed the anger in his heart and did not show it. “In-law, you’re too polite. We’re all family. There’s no need to pick me up. I know the way myself.” ”
