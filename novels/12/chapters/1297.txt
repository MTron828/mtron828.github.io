“Furthermore, Cen Shaoqing never ate at the same table as others. ”

His food was also very simple.

It was always green.

“Zheng Wanyin really could not imagine what ye Zao, whom she had never met before, looked like to be able to conquer Cen Shaoqing. She also really could not imagine what Cen Shaoqing looked like with a girlfriend. ”

“He was still the same as before, like a fairy from heaven? ”

“Zhou Xiang said, “Your cousin-in-law is indeed a very outstanding person.” ”

“Zheng wanyin smiled and said, “I really want to meet cousin-in-law.” ”

“”When your cousin comes back, she will come over.” ”

“Zheng wanyin said in surprise, “Really?” ”

“Yes.”

“Zheng wanyin said excitedly, “That’s great! When cousin-in-law comes over, I will definitely make hibiscus cakes for her to eat.” ”

“Zhou Xiang nodded. “Alright, it’s getting late. Wanyin, you should rest early.” ”

“”Okay.”Zheng wanyin continued, “I’ll bring the hibiscus cakes to grandma for her to taste before going to bed.” ”

“Hurry up and go.”

...

The next day.

“Early in the morning, Xie wanqiu came to Zheng Wanyin’s room. “Wanyin, accompany me out for a walk.” ”

“Zheng Wanyin had just finished washing up. When she heard this, she was stunned for a moment. “Grandma, Big Cousin and third cousin will be coming over today.” ”

“Tell them to wait.”

“Xie Wanqiu wanted to go out on purpose because the two sisters, Cen Yuying and Cen Yueying, were coming back. ”

Who asked the two sisters to look down on her as a Grandma?

“Zheng Wanyin frowned. “Grandma, isn’t this a little bad?” ”

“”What’s bad about it?”Xie wanqiu frowned. “Yinyin, are you not listening to me now?” ”

“Of course not!”

Xie wanqiu picked up the lady’s bag beside her. “Let’s go then.”

Zheng Wanyin could only follow Xie Wanqiu’s footsteps.

“When they reached the city center, it was past ten in the morning. ” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Xie wanqiu saw a fortune-teller with a stall by the side of the road. She walked over and said, “Old Sir, please help me read my fortune.” ”

“May I know what you want to read?”The fortune-teller asked.

“Xie wanqiu sat down and said, “Life and death.” ”

The fortune-teller handed Xie wanqiu a pen and a piece of paper.

Xie Wanqiu wrote Bai Tang on the paper one stroke at a time.

She wanted to know when the Cen family’s old hag would die.

“As long as the Cen family’s old hag died, no one in the CEN family could stand in her way! ”

Zhou Xiang could not stand up.

Cen Shaoqing was a person who did not care about matters.

“At that time, she would be the head of the Cen family, the old lady. ”

It was a pity.

“All these years, although Old Lady Cen’s body had always been ill, it had never affected her life and safety. ”

“Now, not only did old lady Cen’s illness not affect her life and safety, it had even been cured. This made Xie wanqiu feel a little uncomfortable! ”

One had to know that Old Lady Cen was already eighty-nine years old this year!

“A person in her eighties, if she still did not die, what was the point of staying in this world? ”

A waste of resources!

A waste of air!

“In a moment, Xie Wanqiu handed the things she had written to the fortune-teller. “Sorry to trouble you, Old Sir.” ”

“The fortune-teller took the paper and was silent for a long time. Then, he raised his head to look at Xie Wanqiu. “Bai Tong Bai, wood is the wood of longevity. This old lady, the person you want to read is already in his eighties, right?” ”

The 80s were also known as the age of the scomber. They referred to the 80-90 year old.

It seemed that this fortune teller was indeed capable!

“Otherwise, he would not have seen through Bai Tang’s true age just because of a name! ”

Good!

This was really great!

“Xie wanqiu smiled and said, “You are right.” ”

“The fortune teller continued, “Don’t worry! This old man that you have read will definitely live for a hundred years!” ”

Live to be a hundred years old?

Xie wanqiu was shocked.

What the fortune-teller meant was that Bai Tang could live to be a hundred years old?

“After the New Year, Bai Tang would be ninety years old. In other words, she could live another ten years. ”

“Ten years later, she would be over eighty years old! ”

Whether she could live to be a hundred years old was another story!

“Are you sure?”Xie wanqiu held the fortune-teller’s hand tightly. “Are you sure that Bai Tang can live to be a hundred years old?”

“Yes.”The fortune-teller nodded.

“Even after she walked out of the fortune-teller’s office, Xie Wanqiu still had a frown on her face. ”

Ten years!

“That damned old woman, Bai Tang, could actually live for another ten years. ”

“”Grandma, What’s Wrong?” ”

“Xie wanqiu said, “Didn’t you hear what the Fortune-teller said just now? That old woman from the Cen family can at least live for another ten years!” ”

Xie wanqiu felt terrible.

She thought that she could immediately go to the CEN family and make the decision. Who would have thought that the old woman from the Cen family could live for another ten years.

“It was true that good people don’t live long, but evil people live for a thousand years. ”
