Chapter 46: What Do You Think?

Upon hearing this, Zheng Ziheng’s expression was turned sour as if he had eaten a pile of sh*t.

When he first saw her earlier, his impression of her was that Ye Zhuo was pretty good looking. Well now, he knew that she was nothing but a pretty face. She was but an empty shell with no other merits to boast about.

To call Ye Zhuo a fake heiress who knew nothing was a high praise for someone like her. This was because Ye Zhuo’s reputation in the Mu family was really rotten to the core!

“I’ve heard about the Mu family’s fake daughter before, but I didn’t expect that the Mu family’s fake daughter was actually your cousin…” Zheng Ziheng finally said after being silent for a long while.

Seeing the change in Zheng Ziheng’s expression, Lin Xue continued, “Actually, this caught me completely off guard as well! Sigh! Speaking of which, my fourth aunt sure has it tough for her. Previously, she had to raise Mu Yourong all by herself. Yourong’s results are excellent, and she is also so smart! At the very least, Fourth Aunt still had hope for someone to take good care of her in the future! Now that she’s reunited with her biological daughter, Ye Zhuo, I can’t imagine how my fourth aunt is going to live through the rest of her days! The person my mother is most worried about right now is my fourth aunt! After giving birth to such a daughter, in the future… Sigh…”

At the end of her speech, Lin Xue let out a heavy sigh, as if she was worried about Ye Shu.

Mu Yourong was so outstanding, she would definitely be able to get into a good university in the future and stand out.

Would Ye Zhuo be able to do so? Up until now, Ye Zhuo couldn’t even recognize a few words? It was better to count on red rain falling from the sky than to count on her to get into a university!

One could already picture Ye Zhuo’s future. She could only remain a lowly person and live in a shabby basement for the rest of her life.

“Are you saying that Yourong is the true daughter of the Mu Family?” Zheng Ziheng asked.

“Yes.” Lin Xue nodded, “She is the true daughter of a wealthy family through and through. Although Yourong has always lived in the basement with my fourth aunt, she is not inferior to others at all. On the contrary, Ye Zhuo who grew up in a wealthy family and received the best education, is nothing but a useless piece of trash.

Zheng Ziheng nodded. Hearing Lin Xue’s side of the story, Mu Yourong was indeed far more superior.

Suddenly, Lin Xue seemed to have recalled something and continued, “Oh right, hurry up and send me a screenshot of your friend list. I’m going to post it on my Moments.”

“Okay.” Zheng Ziheng nodded. He opened his phone, logged onto the international website, and sent the screenshot of his friend list to Lin Xue.

Lin Xue immediately posted it to her WeChat Moments. There were many students from the research institute on her WeChat. As soon as the screenshot was posted, her Moments exploded!

Even many of her friends who did not actively share and comment on stuff on their Moments came to comment. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

I Am A Laughing Bird, ‘F*ck! F*ck! Is this really the real god Niohuru.YZ?’

Ran Qi, ‘Getting a rub off on the God’s aura!’

The Wanderer, ‘For real? It can’t be a fake account, right?’

Wu Chao, ‘Share with us the contact of the real God!’

‘…’

Lin Xue also received a lot of private messages. Everyone wanted to get to know Niohuru.YZ through Lin Xue.

Lin Xue looked up at Zheng Ziheng. “Ziheng, if only you could add Niohuru.YZ as a friend on WeChat.”

“What are you thinking about!” Zheng Ziheng said speechlessly, “That’s the real god! Do you think people like us get to casually add him as friends on WeChat? I heard that even Dr. Warne couldn’t get hold of Niohuru.YZ WeChat account!”

Hearing this, Lin Xue instantly gave up!

Who was Dr. Warne?

Dr. Warne had made a great contribution to human research. He was a legendary figure that could go down in history!

…

Downstairs in the living room.

Lin Fuhai, the head of the Lin family, had returned.

Lin Haifu was 53 years old this year. Perhaps it was due to his profession that he took good care of himself and looked like he was only in his forties.

Yao Cuifen and Ye Dafu, the old couple, stood beside Lin Haifu on both sides.

One took Lin Haifu’s suit, while the other handed him a pair of slippers.

Not only did they not look like Lin Haifu’s elder, but they looked more like servants of the Lin family.

Truth be told, Lin Haifu did not treat Ye Dafu and Yao Cuifen as his parents-in-law at all. He knew that if he were not the famous doctor, Lin Haifu, and was just a mediocre and ordinary person, these two old people probably would not even look at him. They were just looking out for themselves and doing what benefited them the most.

Ye Shu took the initiative to introduce Ye Zhuo. “Zhuo Zhuo, this is your uncle-in-law! Quickly greet him.”

Ye Zhuo put down her phone and stood up. Her tone was the same as before. “Uncle-in-law.”

In the eyes of Lin Haifu, Ye Zhuo was just a little girl. He would never waste his time on a useless person. He nodded at Ye Zhuo perfunctorily.

Ye Zhuo did not mind it at all. She sat down and continued to look at her phone.

Soon after, Ye Dafu and Yao Cuifen’s favorite son, Ye Shuai, also came over with his wife and children.

Ye Shuai and Lin Xiaowei were cultured people. They looked very simple and did not talk much, but when they opened their mouths, they were all over their Big Sister and Big Brother-in-law. Their words were laced with endless flattery.

They did not even bat an eye at anyone else in the room.

Ye Shuang smiled and said, “Since everyone is almost here, let’s get ready to eat.”

“Wait a little longer.” Lin Haifu looked up at Ye Shuang. “Mr. Li hasn’t arrived yet.”

Ye Shuang understood what Lin Haifu meant. “Oh! Right, right, right! There’s still an important guest who hasn’t arrived! Gosh, my memory is failing me!”

About ten minutes later, the very important guest that Ye Shuang had mentioned arrived.

He was a middle-aged man around 50 years old. He was only 1.6 meters tall, but he weighed about 200 kilograms. His head was directly connected to his shoulders, and his neck could hardly be seen. He was wearing a golden chain as thick as a finger. Overall, he looked a little comical.

At the dining table, Lin Haifu took the initiative to introduce him to everyone. “This is Li Hongwei. He is my patient and also my good friend. Hongwei, these are all my relatives! We are all a big family. Don’t be shy, sit wherever you like!”

Ye Zhuo frowned slightly.

Why did she feel that Li Hongwei kept glancing over to look at Ye Shu? It was truly uncomfortable.

Ye Zhuo turned her eyes slightly and glared at Mr. Li. Her cold eyes were as sharp as knives.

When he suddenly met Ye Zhuo’s gaze, cold sweat immediately broke out on Li Hongwei’s forehead. He hurriedly withdrew his gaze and picked up his glass to drink to ease the awkwardness.

This was a very strange feeling.

Ye Zhuo clearly looked like she was only in her teens, but when he saw that gaze of hers, he could not help but feel afraid.

That kind of fear was almost instinctive.

As the turbid wine entered his throat, the fear in Li Hongwei’s heart slightly dissipated.

When he heard Ye Shuang say that she was going to take everyone out to sing after dinner, Ye Zhuo tugged on Ye Shu’s sleeve and said in a low voice, “Mom, I still have something to do. Let’s leave after we finish eating.”

Ye Shu nodded. “Okay, let’s go back after we finish eating.”

And so, just as they finished eating, Ye Shu announced that they were leaving.

Ye Shuang held Ye Shu’s hand and said with a smile, “Don’t be in a hurry to leave. Come with me for a moment. I have something to tell you.”

“Okay.” Ye Shu nodded.

As two of them entered the Lin family’s study, Ye Shu suddenly realized that Ye Dafu, Yao Cuifen, her second brother, Ye Shuai, and her third sister, Ye Sui, were all in there.

What did these people have to say to her?

Ye Shu suddenly felt a little nervous.

“Sit down,” Ye Shuang pointed at the stool and said.

“I’ll stand.”

Ye Shuang glanced at Ye Shu. Even after so many years, this fourth sister of hers was still so unpresentable. “Fine, if you want to stand, then stand!”

After saying that, Ye Shuang continued, “I asked you to come over because I wanted to ask you, what do you think of Mr. Li?”
