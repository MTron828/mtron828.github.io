“Lin Qingxuan reached out to push away the back of the knife, and the corners of her mouth curled up. “Then what if I don’t Know What’s Good for me?” ”

“”Don’t know what’s good for you? If you don’t know what’s good for you, then I can only show you no mercy!”The Brawny man’s expression suddenly became extremely vicious. He raised the dagger and stabbed it at Lin Qingxuan’s body. ”

“The shadow of the dagger was reflected in Lin Qingxuan’s eyes. At this moment, he found the right time and directly raised his hand to grab the Brawny man’s wrist. ” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“The public security in foreign countries was different from that in China. Lin Qingxuan had lived abroad for so many years, so naturally, she had practiced before. ”

“The Brawny Man obviously did not expect that Lin Qingxuan actually had some skills. He used a grappling hand to throw Lin Qingxuan to the ground, but Lin Qingxuan used a clever move to avoid it. ”

“Seeing this, the other three brawny men immediately joined in. ”

The five of them struggled together.

“Although Lin Qingxuan had practiced before, the other party was, after all, four brawny men. Furthermore, they had knives in their hands. Gradually, they were at a disadvantage. ”

“Xia Xiaoman was extremely anxious. She wanted to go over and help, but she was also being controlled by someone. ”

Although the other party was only a brawny man.

“However, Xia Xiaoman was just an ordinary middle-aged woman. Perhaps in terms of business, she was very smart and was able to handle things swiftly. However, when it came to fighting, she was completely powerless. ”

At this moment.

Xia Xiaoman felt as if she had returned to the night when she was beaten up by an Dongliang.

The same panic.

The same helplessness.

“Moreover, she might very well implicate an innocent person. ”

“Mr. Lin!”

Xia Xiaoman raised her head to look at the Brawny man beside her. Her voice was mixed with some sobs. “Stop fighting! Please stop fighting! I’ll give you the Alipay Password!”

Beep —

Beep —

“At this moment, the sound of sirens suddenly sounded in the air. ”

The police were here! shit

Xia Xiaoman’s eyes suddenly lit up as if she saw salvation.

The five men were completely dumbfounded.

None of them had expected Lin Qingxuan to call the police in advance.

“While the five men were in a daze, Lin Qingxuan grabbed the soil on the ground and quickly threw it on their faces. Then, he grabbed Xia Xiaoman’s hand and ran. “Run!” ”

“During the fight, Lin Qingxuan realized that the five men were very vicious. They had hit their vitals with every move. ”

“If he wasn’t a martial artist, he would have been beaten to the ground by now. ”

“At this time, if he didn’t run, even if the police came, it would be a lose-lose situation. ”

Xia Xiaoman ran at the fastest speed in her life!

Her heart almost jumped out of her chest.

“In a hurry, her gaze swept past Lin Qingxuan’s jaw. Her heart, which was already beating faster, seemed to have lost control. ”

“Suddenly, her heart pounded. ”

The five big men behind her also reacted at this time and quickly caught up.

At this moment.

A few policemen in uniform suddenly appeared at the entrance of the alley.

Seeing this scene.

Xia Xiaoman was like a person who had been blind for a long time who suddenly saw the sunlight.

“Are you okay?”A few policemen quickly ran over and protected Lin Qingxuan and Xia Xiaoman behind them. “Did you call the police?”

“I called the police.”Lin Qingxuan nodded.

Xia Xiaoman was about to say something when she suddenly saw fresh blood oozing out of Lin Qingxuan’s arm. “You’re injured!”

Lin Qingxuan shook his head. “I’m fine.”

“At this moment, the five people also came out of the alley. ”

“When they saw the policemen at the entrance of the alley, all of their faces turned pale. They were so scared that they turned around and ran back in. ”

“Lin Qingxuan immediately said, “Police comrade, it was those few people who extorted me and my friend just now!” ”

“Chase!”The leading policeman immediately let the police dog in.

“Then, the other policemen also chased in. ”

“Not long after, the five strong men were handcuffed by the police and brought out from inside. ”

“Extortion, extortion, murder with a knife. ”

“There were witnesses and evidence. Facing these five men, they would be sent to prison for five to ten years. ”

“After taking their statements and leaving the police station, Xia Xiaoman looked at Lin Qingxuan. “Mr. Lin, shall I take you to the hospital to take a look?” ”

Lin Qingxuan smiled and shook his head. “I’m really fine. It’s just a small injury and I’ve already treated it at the police station.”

“Xia Xiaoman was a little worried. “It’s better to go over. Otherwise, I’ll feel guilty.” ”

“Not only was Lin Qingxuan’s arm injured, the left side of his face was also slightly swollen. ”

He looked very unwell.

“Xia Xiaoman had already said so. In order to make her feel at ease, Lin Qingxuan agreed to go to the hospital with her. ”
