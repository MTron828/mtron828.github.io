Translator: 549690339

“Even if they had done something wrong before, they were still parents after all. How could a junior like Bai Jingshu argue with her parents? ”

An unfilial daughter! She was simply an unfilial daughter!

“”Alright, stop looking.”Bai Jiacheng pulled Zhou Ying away. “Just think of it as us raising an ingrate!” ”

Bai Jingshu looked at the two of them with an indescribable expression on her face.

“Old Master Bai walked over to Bai Jingshu’s side, he sighed and said, “Jingshu, don’t think too much. This is a good thing for you. In the future, you’ll meet other family members.”Thinking about this child’s fate, after all, they were her biological parents. ”

“”Grandfather, thank you.”Bai Jingshu couldn’t control her emotions and reached out to hug Old Master Bai. ”

“Grandfather Bai patted Bai Jingshu on the back. “If you want to cry, then cry.” ”

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “I won’t cry.” ”

“If she cried, then she would lose. Tears should not exist in an adult’s world. ” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“After experiencing what happened to Chen Yaosheng, Bai Jingshu told herself that she must never cry in the future. ”

“This was because sometimes, not only could tears not solve problems, they could also become a burden, a manifestation of negative emotions. ”

...

Lin Ze returned to Galaxy S after settling the matter in Galaxy F.

“He prepared some gifts and decided to visit elder Bai and the Bai family’s parents. However, he was stopped by Bai Jingshu. ”

“Lin Ze asked in confusion, “Why?” ”

“My situation with my parents is complicated. I broke off my relationship with them three days ago.”Bai Jingshu looked at Lin Ze.

Lin Ze was stunned.

“Bai Jingshu continued, “Do you think I’m very unfilial?” ”

“”I believe you’re not that kind of unfilial daughter. Something must have happened that made you very sad, right?”Although he had only known Bai Jingshu for a few months, Lin Ze could tell, bai Jingshu was a very loving and kind-hearted girl. ”

“Thank you.”Bai Jingshu looked up at Lin Ze.

“What are you talking about?”Lin Ze raised his hand and tucked Bai Jingshu’s hair behind his ear. “Let’s Go See Grandpa then?”

“Bai Jingshu said, “Grandpa said that he doesn’t want to see you now.” ”

“Why?”Lin Ze asked.

“Bai Jingshu continued, “He said that he wants to test you again. When you pass the test and when you can see him.” ”

“I didn’t know it was so difficult to marry you!”Lin Ze reached out and hugged Bai Jingshu.

“”What do you think?”Bai Jingshu raised her eyebrows and asked, “Oh right, don’t you care at all about what happened between me and my parents?” ”

“Lin Ze said very seriously, “Yes, I think couples should respect each other. If you’re willing to talk to me, just tell me directly. If you’re not willing to talk to me, even if I ask you, you have a hundred reasons not to tell me.” ”

“Bai Jingshu agreed with Lin Ze. She smiled and said, “Since you’ve already said that, I’ll definitely tell you!” ”

Lin Ze held Bai Jingshu’s hand. “Let’s Find a quiet place to talk.”

“Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded.

This scene happened to fall into Bai Mo’s eyes not far away.

“It had to be said that from a bystander’s point of view, Lin Ze and Bai Jingshu were a perfect match! ”

They were a match made in heaven.

“Most importantly, Lin Ze was really the type of handsome guy that could be deeply remembered with just one look. ”

“Thinking about how Lin Ze was her blind date before, Bai Mo couldn’t help but feel a little emotional. If she hadn’t let him go back then, she would be the one by Lin Ze’s side now. ”

“But when she thought about how Lin Ze was just an ordinary earthling, all these thoughts disappeared in an instant. ”

“No matter how handsome Lin Ze was, he was just an earthling. ”

Earthlings just weren’t good enough for her.

“Bai Mo walked to the two of them and smiled. “SIS, Mr. Lin, what a coincidence to meet you here.” ”

“”Mo Mo.”Bai Jingshu had long known that Bai Mo was involved in Chen Yaosheng’s matter. Now that she saw Bai Mo, she would try to stay as far away as possible. ”

“Bai Mo looked at the two of them holding hands and pretended to be surprised. “SIS, you’re not really together with Mr. Lin, are you?” ”

“Yes.”Bai Jingshu did not deny it.

“Bai Mo continued, “Sis, you and Mr. Lin are really a good match!” ”

Wasn’t it a good match for a low-class person and an idiot?
