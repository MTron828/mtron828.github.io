“”Thank you, uncle. I’ll just stand.”Under such circumstances, how could Cen Shaoqing Dare to sit down? ”

“Lin Jincheng continued, “You should know why I asked you to come over, right?” ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“”Since you know what to do, then I’ll be straightforward.”Lin Jincheng deliberated over the words in his heart and said straightforwardly, “I don’t think you and searing are suitable.” ”

Unsuitable?

“Hearing this, Cen Shaoqing’s heart turned cold. ”

“For the first time in his life, he had a weakness and something that he was afraid of losing. ”

Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads. “Are you concerned about my age?”

Lin Jincheng nodded.

Yes.

He was very concerned about Cen Shaoqing’s age.

There was a difference of eleven years between them.

“After a moment, Cen Shaoqing slowly opened his mouth, “Uncle, anything can change in life, except for age. “I’m eleven years older than searing. I know more about the world and have seen more things than her. I’ve already gone through her eleven years. In the future, I’ll do everything I can to protect her! “I won’t let her get hurt ”

“”Before I met searing, I thought that I would never marry. It wasn’t until I met her that I realized that there’s a better thing in this world called love ”

“Please give me a Chance!”

“For the first time, Cen Wuye, who was a man of his word in business, lowered his head. ”

“Lin Jincheng raised his head and looked at Cen Shaoqing. “Then, what is your shelf life for Love? Five years? Ten years? or twenty years?”Lin Jincheng was not only concerned about Cen Shaoqing’s age. ”

He was more concerned about his identity.

A person like him never lacked women by his side.

Cen Shaoqing broke his commandments today because of ye Zao. He might betray ye Zao Tomorrow because of another woman.

“As a father, Lin Jincheng would never allow ye Zao to be hurt. ”

“Since he knew that Cen Shaoqing would betray ye Zao one day, he might as well cut the Gordian knot now so that he would not regret it in the future. ”

“Forever and ever.”

“Although CEN Shaoqing’s tone was indifferent, there was an imposing manner in his voice. ”

“”Uncle, my love for Luoluo is no less than your love for Aunty. You have loved Aunty all your life and waited for Aunty all your life. My love for Luoluo will last forever.” ”

“Speaking up to this point, CEN Shaoqing continued, “Uncle, please rest assured. My grandmother and my mother both like Luoluo very much. They even treat Luoluo as their own family. If Luoluo is with me, there will definitely not be any mother-in-law or daughter-in-law problems.” ”

Cen Shaoqing’s words undoubtedly caught Lin Jincheng’s weak spot.

Lin Jincheng suddenly thought of himself from many years ago.

“When he introduced ye Shu to Old Lady Lin with a face full of joy, Old Lady Lin’s expression changed. ”

“If Old Lady Lin hadn’t stopped him, he and ye Shu wouldn’t have missed nineteen years just because of a misunderstanding. ”

Lin Jincheng even felt that he was the old lady Lin from back then.

He could not break up the couple.

“After a moment, Lin Jincheng raised his head and looked at Cen Shaoqing. “Are you sure that your love for burning is eternal?” ”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded solemnly. The crystal light shone on his face. “I am sure that I only love burning in this life and this life. I will never let her down!” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Lin Jincheng continued, “The great writer, Shakespeare, once said that all relationships that do not aim at marriage are hooligans. Are you also aiming to get married to burning?” ”

“In a relationship, love alone was not enough. ”

There had to be marriage.

Cen Shaoqing had once said that he was an unmarried person.

It was impossible for ye Zhuo to stay with him forever without a name or status.

“”Does this mean that you agree to my marriage with burning? As long as you agree, I can immediately get married to burning!”Cen Shaoqing did not expect to be pleasantly surprised. ”

He did not expect his father-in-law to acknowledge him so quickly!

“Get Married? You’re Daydreaming!”Lin Jincheng immediately changed his face. “I’m just making an analogy!”

Cen Shaoqing felt as if someone had poured cold water on him.

From the top to the bottom!

“Cen Shaoqing instantly understood the meaning behind Lin Jincheng’s words and slowly opened his mouth, “Uncle, don’t worry. I’m definitely going for the purpose of getting married to burning! Even if you don’t agree now, I’ll wait until you do! “If you don’t believe me, I can immediately transfer all my assets and properties under my name to Zao Zao!” ”

This was his promise and also his recognition of ye Zao.

“As if he didn’t expect that Cen Shaoqing would say such a thing, surprise flashed in Lin Jincheng’s eyes. “You don’t regret it?” ”
