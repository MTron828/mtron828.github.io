“Full star was very good at self-regulation. At this moment, there was no guilty conscience on her face. Instead, it was the anger of being wronged and the sadness of having both her parents dead, “Sun Xiaowen! I don’t know why you suddenly turned on me, but I have never done such a thing!” ”

“If she were to panic at this moment, she would really be done for. ”

She had to stay calm!

Sun Xiaowen was the only one alive now. They did not have any actual evidence to prove that she was the real culprit behind the scenes.

The judge could not be convicted with just words.

“Manxing could not control her tears, “No Child would do such a heinous thing! Sun Xiaowen, why did you first accuse my brother, and now accuse me? Who is the person behind you! Why did you do this!” ”

She could only protect herself if she wanted to drag man Wen out of this matter!

She couldn’t drop the character of a good sister.

“”Miss Manxing, stop pretending.”Sun Xiaowen looked at Manxing. “I wouldn’t have betrayed you, but I didn’t expect you to kill me! You Are Really Vicious!” ”

“Until the moment she closed her eyes, Sun Xiaowen didn’t expect that Manxing would really lay a hand on him! ”

“Speaking up to this point, Sun Xiaowen laughed softly. “But thinking about it, it’s normal. A person who could even lay a hand on his biological parents and younger brother, how could he show mercy to an unrelated person like me?” ”

But fortunately.

“Fortunately, Zhao meiting contacted him in time. ”

They had joined forces from the inside and the outside and used fake death to deceive Manxing.

“”Don’t you dare slander me!”Manxing stood up, he looked at Sun Xiaowen and said, “Who is the real culprit behind this? It’s not something that you can convict with just one mouth! Sun Xiaowen, what have we, the man siblings, done to you? We let you frame US again and again!” ”

“Speaking up to this point, man Xing looked at the judge and continued, “I now suspect that there is no so-called real culprit behind this. You are the biggest culprit! Wen ‘er, I’m sorry. Sister has wronged you...” ”

Man Wen did not pay the bill and directly ignored man Xing.

“As soon as he said this, discussions broke out in the audience. ”

“This Sun Xiaowen is indeed very suspicious!”

“”Miss Man Xing is too pitiful. First, her parents were poisoned to death, then her own brother was framed, and now she is being framed!” ”

“”F * ck, I knew that there would be a twist in this matter!” ”

“”See, I’ve wronged Manwen Again!” ”

“”I actually think that Sun Xiaowen isn’t lying. Manxing might really be the real culprit behind this.”. After all, when they were running for president, Manxing had the greatest chance of becoming president, and Manjiangshan and Zhao Dan were killed the day before the election! If Manxing became president, Manjiangshan and Zhao Dan would definitely be a burden in the future. If Manxing didn’t become president, she could use this to frame manwen! It was killing two birds with one stone! After all, before Miss Ye appeared, Manxing’s plan had already succeeded in half ”

“The analysis above is very reasonable. If that’s the case, Manxing is indeed a match for the real murderer behind the scenes ”

“If Manxing is the murderer, that would be too scary. She was so good at disguising herself before. In front of others, she was a good daughter, a good sister ”

[ don’t jump to conclusions yet. She was led by someone with intentions. I don’t think that Miss Manxing is that kind of person. ]

“[ right, right, right. Miss Manxing is not that kind of person at all. ] ”

“For a moment, everyone fell into a discussion. ”

“At this moment, the judge tapped the small hammer in his hand. ”

“Silence!”

The audience immediately returned to silence.

“The judge looked at Sun Xiaowen. “Sun Xiaowen, you said that Manxing was the real murderer behind the scenes. May I ask what evidence do you have to prove that she did all these things?” ”

Words have no basis.

All of this required evidence.

The judge could not convict someone just because of one sentence.

“Hearing this, Sun Xiaowen was stunned. ”

“Seeing Sun Xiaowen like this, Manxing heaved a sigh of relief. ”

She knew that Sun Xiaowen definitely did not have any evidence.

“Without evidence, no one could touch her at all. ”

“Although she might have to return Manwen’s position to Manwen, there was still plenty of time in the future. She still had plenty of opportunities in the future. ”

She heard that ye Zao was going to return to Earth soon.

“Without ye Zao as a stumbling block, she could easily get rid of Manwen! ”

“Manxing adjusted her sitting posture and looked at the judge calmly. She continued, “Without evidence, this kind of behavior is called framing. Comrade judge, may I ask how one should be convicted of framing?” ”

“She wanted to let Sun Xiaowen know that she, Manxing, was not so easy to bully. ”
