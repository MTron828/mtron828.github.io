“In just a few seconds, Li Yueyue was completely naked. ”

“Because she inhaled the incense, her face became ruddy and her breathing became rapid. When she thought that fifth master Cen would come in soon, she felt her heart beating rapidly. ”

“Fifth Master Cen was not only a legend in the Chinese business world, but also a legend in C Nation. If she could become Madam Cen in one leap, then she would become the most honorable person in C Nation. ”

“At that time, she could also save the Jones family from danger. ” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Although the new emperor was unkind, the other party was, after all, fifth master Cen. ”

“No matter what, the new emperor had to give face to fifth master Cen. ”

“The footsteps were getting closer and closer, and Li Shuyi was holding her breath. ”

“At the same time, outside the door. ”

“Hearing the commotion, Fang yinyue and Li Yueyue rushed over. ”

“Fang yinyue looked at the butler and asked in a low voice, “What’s going on? who called the Police?” ”

“The Butler looked at Cen Shaoqing and said in a low voice, “CEN fifth master’s assistant called the police.” ”

“Hearing that Cen Shaoqing called the police, Fang yinyue asked nervously, “Why did he call the police?” ”

“The butler continued, “It’s, it’s said that the street girl entered the wrong room.” ”

The Streetwalker entered the wrong room!

Fang yinyue frowned slightly.

“In this family, who was most likely to be called a Streetwalker? ”

“Of course, it was Li Sanzhu! ”

“She and Li Sanzhu had been married for so many years, but she had never known that Li Sanzhu was actually such a person. ”

“Hearing the housekeeper’s words, Li Yueyue was also a little surprised. ”

Streetwalker!

She even entered the wrong room.

Cen Shaoqing definitely wouldn’t do such a thing.

Could it be...

Her father?

No Way.

“In Li Yueyue’s impression, her parents’relationship had always been particularly good and stable. Her father should not have done such a thing. ”

Fang yinyue turned to look at Li Sanzhu.

Li Yueyue also turned to look at Li Sanzhu.

“Feeling the gaze of the mother and daughter, Li Sanzhu shuddered and stammered, “W-why are you looking at me?” ”

“Fang yinyue narrowed her eyes. “Tell me, who called the Streetwalker?” ”

“How would I know?”Li Sanzhu said.

“Who would know if you don’t Know?”Fang yinyue asked.

“”Why would I know? I didn’t call her.”At this point, Li Sanzhu sensed that something was wrong. He looked at Fang yinyue and said incredulously, “Yinyue, don’t tell me you think I called that Streetwalker?” ”

“”What else?”Fang yinyue continued, “Could it be Cen Wuye?” ”

“”Of course it’s not me! And it’s not Cen Wuye!”Li Sanzhu was so anxious that his face was red. “Yinyue, I’ve been married to you for so many years. Don’t you know who I am? Would I do such a Thing?” ”

Li Sanzhu didn’t have any good qualities. The only thing he had was loyalty.

And it was absolute loyalty!

“Not to mention street girls, he would not even spare a glance at a pure university student. ”

“Over the years, many bosses had sent people to his side, but he had never been tempted. ”

“Li sanzhu continued, “Yinyue, it’s really not me! You have to believe me!” ”

Fang yinyue did not say anything.

“Seeing her father like this, Li Yueyue continued, “Dad, don’t worry. Fake can’t be real, real can’t be fake. For things you haven’t done, no one can accuse you wrongly!” ”

“”Right, right, right! Yueyue is right. The fake can’t be real, and the real can’t be fake either.” ”

Fang yinyue narrowed her eyes.

“She had been with Li Sanzhu for so many years, so of course she knew Li Sanzhu’s character. ”

“Even if Li Sanzhu had the heart to be a thief, he wouldn’t have the guts to be a thief. ”

“However, if it wasn’t Li Sanzhu, then who was this person? ”

Cen Wuye?

Was he calling for a thief to catch a thief?

Fang yinyue tugged on Li Yueyue’s sleeve.

“”What’s wrong, Mom?”Li Yueyue looked down at Fang yinyue. ”

“Fang yinyue raised her head and asked softly, “Where’s Miss Ye?” ”

“I don’t know.”Li Yueyue looked at the door next door. “She should be busy inside.”

“Once ye Zao worked, he would be fully immersed in his work. ”

“There was such a big commotion, but there was no sound from ye Zao’s side. Then she should be busy. ”

“Fang yinyue continued, “Tell me, do you think it’s fifth master Cen calling out to catch the thief?” ”

“”No!”Li Yueyue directly rejected. “Mom, you don’t know how much fifth master loves Zao. Besides, Zao is so pretty. How could he still be cheating outside? Don’t think about it!” ”

“Although Li Yueyue did not know Cen Shaoqing very well, she could tell that Cen Shaoqing was definitely not that kind of person. ”

His love with Ye Zhuo would not be so fragile.

“On this side, the moment the two police officers stepped into the room, they felt that there was something wrong with the incense in the room. ”
