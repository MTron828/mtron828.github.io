Zhao Xueyin choked.

“She thought that after she said these words, Ye Zao would be ashamed. ”

“After all, she was the acknowledged genius in the financial world. ”

“In front of her, Ye Zao couldn’t even be considered a pinky. ”

“She didn’t think that not only was ye Zao not ashamed, but he was also so arrogant. ”

I really don’t know where she got her confidence from!

A dead pig is not afraid of boiling water!

Hearing that.

Si lui glanced at ye Zao with a complicated look in his eyes.

He did not have a good impression of ye Zao to begin with.

“After listening to these words, his impression of ye Zao completely plummeted. ”

What qualifications did ye Zao have to be like this in front of Zhao Xueyin?

It was said that the later waves of the Yangtze River surpassed the earlier waves.

“When ye Langhua was young, she was after all a gentleman and a talented woman. Although she did not meet a lady, it was still something that happened later. ”

“However, not only did ye Zao not inherit ye Langhua’s talent, but he was even worse than ye Langhua, this younger generation. ”

“Not only was ye Zao’s talent bad, he was also very conceited. ”

Did she know who was standing in front of her.

Zhao Xueyin.

She was a publicly recognized financial talented woman in the financial world.

“If it was anyone else, they would definitely be very humble and uneasy in front of Zhao Xueyin. ”

“However, not only was ye Zhuo not embarrassed, he even had an arrogant look on his face. ”

This was a little repulsive.

“If ye Zhuo was not ye Langhua’s granddaughter, she would not even have the qualifications to step into the Shunxi Financial Group, let alone speak to Zhao Xueyin face to face. ”

Zhao Xueyin was the bright moon in the sky.

Ye Zhuo could not even compare to the mud on the ground.

“Si lui frowned slightly, his heart aching for Zhao Xueyin. ”

It was difficult for Zhao Xueyin.

She actually had to deal with a person like Ye Zhuo.

“Si lui raised his head and looked at ye Zhuo, “Miss Ye, let me bring you to your office to take a look first, okay?” ”

“Elder Zhang nodded and echoed, “Yes, yes, yes! Let’s go to the office first!” ”

“Zhao Xueyin reminded, “Big Brother Si, there’s a board meeting in half an hour. You should make good use of the time.” ”

Today was the day that ye Zao returned to the Shunxi Financial Group.

“No matter what, the superficial work still had to be done. ”

They had to introduce ye Zao in front of the board members.

“Putting aside ye Zao’s ability,. ”

She was still elder Ye’s descendant after all.

“Although elder ye was no longer in the Shunxi Financial Group, his influence on the financial group was still very great. ”

“Okay.”Si lui nodded.

The president’s office was also on the 58th floor.

But it was on the other side of the 58th floor.

“A few minutes later, Si lui brought ye Zhuo and elder Zhang to the office. ”

The office was very big.

It was more than 100 square meters in total.

Si lui introduced the internal environment of the office to Ye Zhuo.

“”This is the lounge and this is the secretarial room. If Miss Ye is not satisfied with the renovation, you can ask someone to redecorate it.” ”

Ye Zhuo shook her head slightly. “No need. It’s fine just like this.”

She did not have high requirements for the external environment.

“As she spoke, Ye Zhuo walked to a calligraphy painting and stopped in front of it, deep in thought. ”

“Elder Zhang walked over and said, “Zhuo Zhuo, what do you think of this calligraphy?” ”

“It’s alright.”Ye Zhuo gave a very pertinent evaluation.

“Actually, the level of the calligraphy on the wall could not even be considered average. ”

It was obvious that it was lacking in energy.

It was like drawing a tiger but not a dog.

“However, as the saying goes, a different profession is like a different mountain. This calligraphy wouldn’t be a big problem to fool outsiders. ”

“Elder Zhang stroked his beard and narrowed his eyes, carefully examining the calligraphy on the wall. ”

Hearing that.

The Si lui frowned slightly.

The calligraphy on the wall was personally written by Zhao Xueyin.

“Someone offered 100,000 yuan, but Zhao Xueyin did not agree to sell it. ”

“However, ye Zhuo actually used a light sentence of ‘not bad’to deny the results of Zhao Xueyin’s labor. ”

“If it was really not bad, would anyone be willing to offer 100,000 yuan to buy it? ”

Si lui did not understand calligraphy.

But he could tell that Zhao Xueyin’s calligraphy piece was very good.

Even the average calligraphy master could not compare to her.

“After all, an average calligraphy master’s calligraphy could not be sold for 100,000 yuan a piece. ”

But Zhao Xueyin’s calligraphy could!

This meant that Zhao Xueyin’s ability had long surpassed an average calligraphy master.

A person like ye Zhuo who did not even know how to hold a brush was not qualified to comment on Zhao Xueyin.

Ye Zhuo must have done it on purpose.

“She knew that this calligraphy was written by Zhao Xueyin, so she deliberately belittled Zhao Xueyin. ”

It was human nature.

“The more there was nothing, the more she cared about something. ”

“This was because ye Zhuo did not know calligraphy at all. When he saw that Zhao Xueyin’s calligraphy was so good, he became jealous and tried to comfort himself by belittling her. ”

This kind of person was also disgusting.

“Fortunately, Zhao Xueyin did not hear what he said. The lawyer frowned. ”
