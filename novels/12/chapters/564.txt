“Ever since the incident of changing her surname, Old Lady Lin has been brooding over it. In addition, ye Shu bullied Feng Qianhua today. Old Lady Lin was worried that she wouldn’t be able to find an opportunity to teach ye Shu a lesson.”

“At this moment, she would definitely use this opportunity to teach ye Shu a lesson.”

“As expected, Old Lady Lin’s expression immediately changed when she heard this. “Aggrieved? After marrying into the Li family, she will become the matriarch of the Li family. This is a blessing that no one can hope for! I think the Li family is not bad! Very good!””

She had to let ye Shu know that she was the one in charge of the Lin Family!

“If ye Zhuo’s surname was not Zhao, he had to marry into the Li family!”

This was the consequence of going against her!

“Zhao shuning continued, “But Li Yibiao is already in his forties, and he’s still the father of two children. If ye Zhuo marries him, won’t he become a stepmother...””

“”So what if he’s in his forties? “So what if he’s a stepmother?”Old Lady Lin said angrily, “That wild girl didn’t even look at herself in the mirror! Did she think she was Xianxian? Could she marry into a family like the Cen Family? If the head of the Li family liked her, she would be secretly happy!””

What was ye Zao?

“In front of Feng Xianxian, Ye Zao was the mud under Feng Xianxian’s feet.”

“Hearing this, the corners of Zhao Shuning’s mouth curled up. “Mom, you’re right! I also think that ye Zao can’t compare to Xianxian!””

“Old Lady Lin turned to look at Zhao shuning and continued, “Shuning, don’t tell anyone about this first! Tomorrow Morning, you go to the Li family. If Li Yibiao has the intention, you can find a time to invite him to our house!””

“After getting a satisfactory answer, Zhao shuning smiled and said, “It’s better to choose a different day. Why don’t I go to the Li family in the afternoon?””

“Okay.”Old Lady Lin nodded.

Zhao shuning went back to her room to change her clothes and went to the Li family.

It was Li Yibiao who personally received her.

Li Yibiao lived up to his name. He was particularly strong and had a strong build. He was at least 200 to 300 pounds and looked fierce. He looked not to be trifled with.

Zhao shuning swallowed her saliva. No wonder there were rumors that Li Yibiao had a special hobby.

“”No wonder I heard a magpie calling this morning. It turns out to be a distinguished guest!”Li Yibiao smiled and said, “May I know what the fourth Madam Lin is here to teach me?””

“Zhao shuning smiled and looked up. “Mr. Li, I came to look for you. Of course, I have good news.””

“Go ahead.”

“Zhao shuning carefully chose his words in his mind. “Then I’ll be frank with you. Mr. Li, your wife has been dead for a long time. I wonder if you have any plans to remarry?””

Li Yibiao looked at Zhao shuning with a complicated expression.

The Li family and the Lin family had never had much contact. They didn’t interfere in each other’s business. Why would Zhao shuning ask such a question?

Li Yibiao narrowed his eyes. “Could it be that fourth madam Lin has a suitable person who wants to matchmake me?”?

“Zhao shuning smiled and said, “Mr. Li is indeed a smart person. You can understand it easily! That’s why it’s so easy to talk to smart people! I really have a suitable candidate here!””

“Who?”Li Yibiao raised his head.

“”My niece,”Zhao shuning replied.”

“The daughter that Master Lin just acknowledged?”Li Yibiao was a little in disbelief.

Zhao shuning nodded.

“Li Yibiao laughed out loud, “Fourth Madam Lin, don’t make fun of me!”Everyone in the capital knew that Lin Jincheng was a womanizer! Would Lin Jincheng marry his daughter to a widower like him?”

“Besides, the status of the Lin family and the Li family didn’t match!”

Unless Lin Jincheng’s brain had been kicked by a donkey!

“Zhao shuning said very seriously, “Mr. Li, if I’m joking with you, then I won’t make this trip today.””

Li Yibiao frowned. He suddenly couldn’t figure out what the Lin family was planning.

“After saying that.., zhao shuning continued, “Mr. Li, actually, I know your concerns! Then, I Won’t hide it from you. I’ll tell you the truth! My niece came from the countryside. Other than her face, there’s nothing good about her! My mother has long wanted to find someone to marry her off! She doesn’t want to be an eyesore at home! If you like her, it’s her good fortune!””

“Does master Lin Know About This?”Li Yibiao asked.

“”Yes! Of course he knows! In fact, this is also his idea!”Zhao shuning continued, “Mr. Li, don’t look at how grand the family recognition banquet was last time. In fact, it was all held for outsiders to see!”” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Li Yibiao still couldn’t believe it.

“Zhao shuning stood up from the chair, “Mr. Li, that’s all I have to say. If you have such a wish, come to our Lin family tomorrow morning. At that time, my mother will naturally talk to you in detail!”! “If you don’t believe me, then you can only say that you and my niece are fated to be apart!””
