“President Xu just stood there like that. He was completely stunned, like a statue. ”

“It had started to rain, and he had forgotten to hide. ”

Was the person just now really Dr. YC?

Was he not mistaken?

“Ye Sen was about to close the car door, but when he saw President Xu still standing there in a daze, he turned to look at Ye Zao. “Zao Zao, Wait a moment!” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly. He turned the steering wheel and stopped the car again.

“Ye Sen held the umbrella and jogged to President Xu’s side. “President Xu, didn’t you bring an umbrella?” ”

“President Xu looked up and only then did he realize that it was raining. “No, I didn’t bring one.” ”

“Here’s my umbrella for you.”Ye Sen handed the umbrella to President Xu.

President Xu took the umbrella. “Thank you.”

“”You’re welcome.”Ye Sen thought for a moment and then said, “President Xu, your driver hasn’t arrived yet. Why Don’t you let my niece Send You Back?” ”

Send him back?

President Xu looked at the Land Rover that was parked there and was a little restless. Perhaps he had seen wrongly just now?

That person was not Dr. YC at all!

Right.

He must have seen wrongly.

How could ye Sen be Dr. YC’s uncle?

Director Xu looked up at ye Sen. “Isn’t this a little bad? Why would I trouble Dr. YC?”

“Ye Sen smiled and said, “What do you mean by ‘Dr. YC’? She is my niece Right Now! Let’s go, director Xu! The rain is getting heavier!” ”

The winter rain was particularly cold. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Director Xu was pulled into the car by Ye Sen.

“The two of them sat in the back seat. Ye Sen looked up at Ye Zao. “Zao Zao, send director Xu Back First! By the way, director Xu, where do you live?” ”

“”I live in the bustling city,”chief xu replied. ”

“Ye Sen continued, “Zao Zao, it’s closer to the bustling city by taking panoramic road.” ”

Ye Zao nodded slightly and turned the steering wheel to take panoramic road. “Okay.”

Chief Xu looked at the face in the rearview mirror that looked like a painting. He quietly turned on his phone and searched for Dr. YC.

The internet speed was very fast.

“In less than a few seconds, news about Dr. YC appeared on the web page. ”

That’s right!

It was exactly the same.

This was Dr. YC!

The Living Dr. YC.

President Xu looked at his phone and then at the rearview mirror. His emotions were very complicated.

“He had never thought that one day, he would get into Dr. YC’s car. ”

He had never thought that Ye Sen was actually Dr. YC’s uncle.

“At first, he thought that Ye Sen was bragging. ”

President Xu felt that his face hurt a little.

“After a long while, president Xu finally reacted and said, “Dr. Y, Dr. YC, can we get out of the car and take a photo later?”It was not easy to meet a famous person, so of course he had to take a photo and show it off. ”

“After all, this was Dr. YC! ”

“If she could really develop an aircraft carrier, she would be the first person in the history of aircraft carriers! ”

“Sure.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Thank you!”President Xu immediately thanked him.

“Ye Sen smiled and continued, “Isn’t it just a photo? You’re welcome!” ”

“Soon, the car drove into the bustling residential area. Ye Zhuo looked back slightly and asked, “President Xu, how many buildings do you live in?” ”

“President xu hurriedly said, “Building 16. Just turn right at the next intersection.” ”

“Okay.”

“After a few seconds, the car stopped in front of Building 16. ”

Ye Zhuo opened the door and got out of the car.

CEO Xu and Ye Sen followed closely behind.

“CEO Xu handed the phone to ye Sen. “CEO Ye, please help us take a photo.” ”

“”You’re welcome,”Ye Sen said. ”

“Ye Zhuo and CEO Xu stood in front of the apartment building. Ye Sen held the phone. “Three, two, one! It’s Done!” ”

“Director Xu jogged over to take the phone. “Thank you, director Ye!” ”

“You’re welcome.”

“Director xu continued, “Then about the cooperation, we’ll talk about it tomorrow.” ”

“”Okay.”Ye Sen nodded and asked, “Why don’t I look for you at 10 o’clock Tomorrow Morning?” ”

“Director xu hurriedly said, “No need, no need! I’ll go to Shengdong to look for you at 10 o’clock! It just so happens that I have something to do there on the Way Tomorrow!” ”

“”Then I’ll have to trouble you, CEO Xu.” ”

CEO Xu waved his hand. “It’s no trouble at all.”

“Ye Sen turned to look at Ye Zao. “Zao Zao, let’s go.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zao opened the car door and got into the car.

He got into the car.

“Ye Zao continued, “Uncle, did you bring a change of clothes? If you didn’t bring a change of clothes, you can go back to your place to get them now. My mother said that after Laba, you shouldn’t live outside. It’s safer to live at home.”This was a custom in yunjing, it was said that the eighth day of the twelfth lunar month was a holiday for the Immortals in heaven. From the eighth day of the twelfth lunar month to the thirtieth day of the Lunar New Year, when there were no immortals to maintain order in the human world, it would be more chaotic. ”

Wanderers who worked hard outside would choose to come back and live on the eighth day of the twelfth lunar month.
