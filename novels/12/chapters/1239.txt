Translator: 549690339

The stench is overwhelming!

“Zhao Xueyin was on the verge of breaking down. She stood where she was and her last bit of rationality had disappeared without a trace. She pointed at the crowd and said, “Isn’t it just a cat? It’s over! All of you are done for! I will make all of you bear legal responsibility!” ”

Isn’t it just a cat?

This sentence provoked the anger of the crowd.

“Bang!”

“A muscular man rushed over and punched Zhao Xueyin. “Your Life is your life, but isn’t the life of a cat your life? A person like you doesn’t deserve to be a human!” ”

“Then, a group of people surrounded Zhao Xueyin and punched and kicked her. ”

Painful! CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Very painful.

“Ptui!”

“Feeling that punching and kicking wasn’t enough, many people fiercely spat on Zhao Xueyin’s body. ”

“When the Butler rushed over with his bodyguards, this was what they saw. ”

“Miss!”

“Get out of the way!”

“Fortunately, the Butler had enough bodyguards. Otherwise, he would not be a match for these people. “Quickly help miss up!” ”

A few bodyguards endured the churning in their stomachs and helped Zhao Xueyin up from the ground. They quickly ran in the direction of the Villa area.

“A few minutes later, Zhao Xueyin was brought back to the villa by the bodyguards. ”

“Zhao xueyin cried, “Send a lawyer’s letter! Send a lawyer’s letter to those unruly people! I Won’t let them off!” ”

She had never lost so much face in her life.

Those people actually dared to treat her like this!

She was thrown rotten eggs in front of the reporters.

“As long as she thought of the experience just now, Zhao Xueyin’s entire body trembled. ”

Ye Zhuo.

It must be ye Zhuo.

These people must have been called over by Ye Zhuo.

Zhao Xueyin did not expect ye Zhuo to use such an underhanded move.

He had actually called over reporters and extras.

That’s right.

“In Zhao Xueyin’s eyes, those people who threw rotten eggs at her were all actors hired by Ye Zhuo. ”

“After all, other than ye Zhuo, no one else knew about the cat abuse incident. ”

“Other than ye Zhuo, no one else would do such a disgusting thing. ”

Ye Zhuo was also shameless.

“She did not dare to directly negotiate with her, so she called these people over. ”

Did they really think that she was easy to bully

Just wait.

She must make ye Zhuo pay the price!

Father Zhao’s face turned black. “Don’t you think that you’ve embarrassed yourself enough?”

“After saying that, Father Zhao raised his hand to slap Zhao Xueyin, but when he saw that Zhao Xueyin was covered in filth and the stench was overwhelming, he silently put down his hand. ”

How could he have given birth to such an embarrassing daughter like Zhao Xueyin?

“Go and wash yourself clean!”

Only then did Zhao Xueyin realize that she still had the mucus from the rotten eggs on her body. The servants in the house all looked at her strangely.

Zhao Xueyin was both angry and annoyed. She turned around and walked upstairs.

“Even after Zhao Xueyin left, the air was still filled with a thick stench. ”

“Father Zhao turned to look at Liu Sanniang, “Madam Liu, I’m really sorry for making a fool of myself. The Qian family would like to trouble you to help us explain. Actually, Xueyin is a very nice and kind girl. This matter must be a misunderstanding! Perhaps someone is deliberately framing her!” ”

“”A kind and good girl? A good girl can do such a Thing?”Liu Sanniang looked at Father Zhao, her eyes were full of ridicule, “A misunderstanding is even less likely to be a misunderstanding! There are videos and evidence here. Could it be that there is a second person in this world who looks exactly like Miss Zhao? Mr. Zhao, do you really think we are all fools?” ”

Liu Sanniang was really angry!

“Although she loved money, she also knew that a gentleman loved money and used it wisely! ”

She would definitely not go against her conscience and speak up for Zhao Xueyin just because of money.

A person like Zhao Xueyin should go to the eighteenth level of hell and let her suffer all kinds of cruel torture!

She did not want to stay in the world and harm other people.

“Today, she was torturing a cat, but tomorrow, she might be torturing a human! ”

What could a cold-blooded person like her not do?

“Liu Sanniang continued, “Mr. Zhao, everyone says that a son does not teach his father his mistakes! Although Zhao Xueyin is not a son, you are also responsible for the way she has become today! This shows that you have not done your duty as a father at all!” ”

“Father Zhao was so embarrassed by what she said, he sighed and said, “Yes, yes, yes. Mrs. Liu, you are right. It is all my fault. This child’s mother left early. I have been busy with official business all day, so I have cared too little about her! “But a child is a child after all. People are not sages. Everyone makes mistakes! “Moreover, Xueyin is still a child. Please give her a chance to change! “I believe she will definitely pass! “I’ll have to trouble you to take care of the Qian family... ...” ”
