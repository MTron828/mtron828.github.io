Translator: 549690339

“Although the probability was a little low, there was still a word called miracle. ”

“Although Qiu di said so, Qiu Chang Zhen was still a little worried. “Why don’t you go to Earth?” ”

This low-level human always gave Qiu Chang Zhen a sense of crisis.

This sense of crisis was very strange and made people shudder.

“It was clearly just a photo, but it made Qiu Chang Zhen feel guilty. ”

He had a feeling that ye Zhuo was not dead.

This lowly human

Let Her Go to earth?

That Lowly Planet?

How was that possible!

“With her status on Earth, what was the difference between going to Earth and lowering her status? ”

“Qiu Di raised her head to look at Qiu Chang Zhen. “Father, I feel that you are making a mountain out of a Molehill.”A mere lowly human was not enough to make Qiu Chang Zhen so afraid. ”

“”Xiao Di, but I still feel a little worried.”Qiu Changzhen continued, “The election will be held in a few days. If something happens at this critical moment, then it will be all for nothing!” ”

“The more critical the moment, the more likely it was to make a mistake. ”

Qiu Di had waited so long. He must not be influenced by anyone at this time

“”Father, you are worrying too much.”The corner of Qiu Di’s mouth curled up. “Earth’s resources are limited and its ability is exhausted. It is two million light years away from our home planet. Do you think ye Zao can go to Earth alone under such circumstances?” ”

“In other words, even if ye Zao was really ye Zao, so what? ”

“Earth was a low-level planet that could not be considered low-level. Ye Zao was on a low-level planet. She could have anything she wanted. It would take two years to build a light-speed aircraft carrier. With this ability, could she jump out of earth? ”

“Even if she could jump out of earth, she could not jump out of the Solar System! ”

What right did a low-level human have to compete with her?

It was ridiculous.

Who Was She?

“She was the daughter of the chief of the Chang Yue country. In the future, she would become the ruler of the Chang Yue country. ”

What was this low-level human?

Could she be compared to her little finger?

“Thinking of this, Qiu Di’s eyes were full of pride. ” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Hearing this, Qiu Changzhen narrowed his eyes. What Qiu di said was not completely unreasonable. However, there was another saying, “Don’t be afraid of ten thousand things, just be afraid of the unexpected.”. ”

If something went wrong...

Their Qiu family’s Hope would be lost.

“Qiu Di had the ability, but she was still too young. ”

“”Xiao Di, what do you mean?”Qiu Changzhen turned to look at Qiu Di. ”

“”Don’t worry about her,”Qiu di said. ”

“Qiu Changzhen Thought for a moment and then said, “Xiao Di, is this really okay?”He was still a little worried. ”

Ye Zao was their mortal enemy.

“Previously, when ye Zao was around, Qiu Di would never be able to stand out. ”

“Ever since ye Zao left, Qiu Di had risen step by step. Now, it was time for the election! ”

“But now, another ye Zao had appeared on Earth. ”

How could autumn town not be worried?

“”Father, you don’t have to worry.”Autumn flute glanced at autumn town, the corners of her mouth curling into a smile, “So what if this lowly person and ye Zao are the same person? Those lowly people on Earth used 10,000 years, but they still couldn’t leave the Solar System. Do You Think Ye Zao Can?” ”

Leaving the Solar System wasn’t enough to just have the ability. They still needed resources and energy.

“Hearing this, Qiu Changzhen heaved a sigh of relief and continued, “Have you prepared everything for the general election?” ”

“”You don’t have to worry about the general election. Just wait for me to become the Crown.”With Wu Han’s loyalty and protection, how could she be afraid that those old guys wouldn’t choose her? ”

“Besides, who else in Changyue had the right to sit on that throne besides her? ”

“”Wu Han shouldn’t remember anything in a short period of time, right?”Qiu Chang Zhen asked. ”

“Wu Han was previously ye Zao’s most loyal subordinate. After witnessing ye Zao’s ashes, he felt very guilty and couldn’t recover from the setback. He lost his memory and went crazy. He was picked up by Qiu Di, controlled with drugs, and tampered with Wu Han’s memories, in Wu Han’s memories, ye Zao’s appearance had long disappeared. ”

“And Qiu di had become Wu Han’s savior, the savior of Chang Yue. ”

“Therefore, Wu Han was only loyal to Qiu Di! ”

“Other than Qiu Di, he ignored everyone’s orders. The current Wu Han was no different from a walking corpse. He was just a puppet in Qiu Di’s hands. ”

“”Don’t worry, I won’t.”Qiu Di’s face was full of confidence. Her medical skills were second to none in Chang Yue, so no one dared to claim to be first! ”

“Even if the great state doctor saw Wu Han, he wouldn’t be able to see anything wrong. ”

Unless ye Zao could be resurrected!
