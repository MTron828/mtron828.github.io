“”Okay, I’ll give you a chance to show off.”Ye Zhuo sat on the sofa. ”

Cen Shaoqing started to blow her hair.

“Ye Zhuo’s hair was thick, long, and soft. It looked like top-grade silk. Cen Shaoqing held the hair dryer in one hand, and his other hand weaved through her black hair. ”

The scene was very harmonious.

“Ye Zao continued, “I saw song Shiyu today.” ”

Song Shiyu.

“Upon hearing this name, Cen Shaoqing furrowed his brows without anyone noticing. ”

“Where did you see him?”Cen Shaoqing opened his thin lips and asked.

“Ye Zao said, “He lives right next door to us. We even had supper together tonight.” ”

They had supper together.

A man and a woman were actually having supper together.

“Hearing this, Cen Shaoqing felt a little depressed. ”

That feeling was a little strange.

“A second ago, the sky was clear, but in the next second, dark clouds covered the sky. ”

“What did you eat together?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“Ye Zao said, “We ate stinky tofu and cold noodles. Don’t mention it, the cold noodles here are quite delicious. Let’s try it tomorrow.” ”

“”Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and said unintentionally, “Does song Shiyu have a girlfriend?” ”

“”I don’t think so,”ye Zao said. ”

He doesn’t have a girlfriend?

“It’s been so long, and song Shiyu still hasn’t given up? ”

“Cen Shaoqing was thinking about something. The strength in his hand was not precise, and his index finger wrapped around her hair. ”

“Hiss.”Ye Zao looked back at Cen Shaoqing. “What are you thinking about?”

“Did I hurt you?”Cen Shaoqing instantly reacted

Ye Zhuo nodded. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Cen Shaoqing immediately apologized. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I’ll be more careful.” ”

“Ye Zhuo looked at him curiously. “Cen Shaoqing, what are you thinking about?” ”

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “I went to see a friend today. He wants to meet you. Do you want to meet him?” ”

“What friend?”Ye Zhuo asked

“CEN Shaoqing said, “We met at the temple.” ”

“”Sure.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and continued, “Boys and girls?” ”

Cen Shaoqing put down the hairdryer. “I don’t have any female friends.”

“After saying that, CEN Shaoqing continued, “Would you object to me having female friends?” ”

Ye Zhuo looked back slightly. “Why would I object? You have the right to make friends.”

Ye Zao was not an unreasonable person.

There was also a pure friendship between men and women.

“Cen Shaoqing suddenly did not know how to continue. He continued, “The lychee has been peeled.” ”

Ye Zao raised his head and looked at Cen Shaoqing. “Why do I feel that you are a little strange today?”

“You feel wrong.”Cen Shaoqing handed the lychee to Ye Zao. “Eat the Lychee.”

“Ye Zhuo picked up a lychee and said, “Are you really okay?” ”

“I’m really okay.”Cen Shaoqing smiled. “What could be wrong with me?”

Ye Zhuo raised his head and looked at Cen Shaoqing. “Mr. Cen.”

“Yes.”

Ye Zhuo’s eyes curved. “Are you jealous?”

“No.”Cen Shaoqing directly denied it.

How could he be jealous!

“Really?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“Really.”Cen Shaoqing looked serious.

“Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Oh, then I’m going out with song Shiyu Tomorrow.” ”

Going out together?

“You’re going out together?”Cen Shaoqing’s expression instantly changed.

“”Yeah.”Ye Zhuo continued, “Don’t go. Coincidentally, you’re not familiar with song Shiyu either.” ”

Cen Shaoqing didn’t know what to say.

“I...”

“”What’s Wrong With You?”Ye Zhuo continued, “By the way, not only do I want to go out with him, I might not be back tomorrow night.” ”

“Why?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“Ye Zhuo’s red lips parted slightly, and he asked, “What do you mean, why?” ”

“Why aren’t You Back?”Cen Shaoqing was very depressed.

“It was fine if he went out to play with song Shiyu, but he wasn’t coming back yet! ”

He wasn’t going home for the Night!

“He suspected that song Shiyu was going to give him a hat, but he didn’t dare to tell ye Zhuo directly. ”

Ye Zhuo smiled faintly. “Don’t meddle in the matters of beauties.”

“Cen Shaoqing took a deep breath and tried his best to calm himself down. He looked at ye Zhuo and continued, “Leader, are you really not coming back tomorrow night?” ”

“Do I look like I’m Joking?”Ye Zao asked back.

It really didn’t look like he was joking.

“CEN Shaoqing said, “No, you can’t spend the night outside with song Shiyu.” ”

“Why?”Ye Zao asked.

Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads. “Because song Shiyu doesn’t look like a good person.”

“”I’ve known him for a long time,”ye Zao said. “At that time, you weren’t my boyfriend. I knew him better than you.” ”
