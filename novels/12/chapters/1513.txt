“However, Bai Shu had been waiting for a long time, but she still couldn’t find ye Zhuo. She couldn’t help but feel a little anxious. She turned to look at Old Mrs. Cen. “Sister Tang, did you remember wrongly?” ”

“Remember what?”Old Mrs. Cen asked.

“”Miss Ren didn’t come today,”Bai Shu said. ”

“”She won’t,”old Mrs. Cen said. “I talked to Ye Zi Last Night. She told me that she will definitely come today.” ”

“Yezi?”Bai Shu frowned. “Who’s Yezi?”

“”Are you old and confused?”Old Lady Cen looked at Bai Shu and continued, “Yezi is my granddaughter-in-law!” ”

Bai Shu narrowed her eyes. “Then who’s searing?”

“When she said this, Bai Shu widened her eyes, she said incredulously, “Oh! Your Shaoqing is two-timing! Sister Tang, just like that, you still have the cheek to call our third brother! Isn’t your Shaoqing the same! As the saying goes, this man will only be honest if he hangs on the wall!” ”

“Old Lady Cen did not like to hear these words. She could say bad things about him, but others could not! ”

“”What nonsense are you spouting! What do you mean our Shaoqing is just like your third brother! If Shaoqing was like this, I would have broken his legs long ago!” ”

“Bai Shu snorted, “You’re the one who can’t bear to hit him! If you did, would you still be here? The leaves are burning! I can’t even tell!” ”

Bai Shu had experienced too much in her early years and felt that it was okay for a man to cheat on her.

Men?

Who wouldn’t be unfaithful!

“Some people could control themselves, while others couldn’t control themselves. ”

People were not sages. They all had emotions and desires. This was something that couldn’t be controlled.

“If Cen Shaoqing was two-timing, she would not find it strange. ”

“Cen Shaoqing was young and promising. He had power and influence. As a young man, he was full of anger. It was normal for him to lose control occasionally. ”

“”Yezi and Zhuozao are the same person! Didn’t I tell you that my granddaughter-in-law’s name is Ye Zhuozao?”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “I’m not bragging! “If that Brat dares to do even the slightest thing to let yezi down, I will smash his dog head and break his dog legs! “I will make him unable to take care of himself for the rest of his life!” ”

Old Lady Cen was not joking.

“Regardless of whether it was a mental or physical affair, it was unbearable. Otherwise, Old Lady Cen would not have cut ties with her own nephew. ”

“”I see.”Bai Shu sighed. “I told you, the people of Your Cen family have always had deep feelings for each other. How could you be a two-timing person!” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen snorted and said with some pride, “That’s a must! who asked our Cen family to have such good manners!” ”

“Bai Shu:”...”she suspected that old Mrs. Cen was referring to her, but she had no evidence. ”

“”Sister Tang, is your granddaughter-in-law really that outstanding?”Bai Shu continued to ask. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen was like a proud peacock. “Of course! Let me tell you, if my granddaughter-in-law was second, no one would dare to acknowledge her as the first!” ”

“Bai Shu smiled and said, “I don’t think so. After all, a weasel praises her fragrance and a Hedgehog praises her light! I heard from Xiang Xiang that that girl cured your migraine. is that why you like her so much?” ”

Everyone has their shortcomings. Bai Shu did not believe that ye Zao did not have any.

The reason Old Mrs. Cen praised Ye Zao so much was definitely because she cured her migraine!

“”You’ll know when you see her. I Can’t be bothered to argue with you now,”old Mrs. Cen said as she looked out of the window. ”

“Just then, the sound of a car engine came from outside ”

Old Mrs. Cen stood up from the sofa. “It must be my granddaughter-in-law!”

Bai Shu also stood up.

“In a moment, the sound of footsteps came from outside the door. ”

“”Grandma, aunt.”Cen Shaoqing walked in with Ye Zao. ”

“You’re here.”Old Madam Cen immediately came over and grabbed ye Zhuo’s hand. “Is it cold outside? Look at this little icy hand!”

“As soon as she finished speaking, Old Madam Cen rolled her eyes at Cen Shaoqing. “You Little Brat, is this how you take care of others?” ”

Cen Shaoqing touched his nose. “It’s my fault.”

“It was your fault to begin with!”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Grandma, it has nothing to do with him. I was the one who caught the snow outside.” ” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Although he had been in this world for a long time, ye Zao still liked snow very much. Every time he went out, he would hold a snow ball and play with it. ”

“”It has to do with him,”old Mrs. Cen continued, “Your hands are so cold. Doesn’t he know how to warm you up?” ”

“After saying that, old Mrs. Cen pulled ye Zao to Bai Shu and introduced, “Zao Zao, let me introduce you. This is your aunt. Younger sister, this is my granddaughter-in-law, ye Zao!” ”
