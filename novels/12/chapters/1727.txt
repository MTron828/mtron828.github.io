“[ if that’s really the case, YC is too scheming. Just to show off her own abilities, she denies the value of the existence of a planet. The existence of such a person in China is simply the tragedy of a country! ] ”

[ such a person should be kicked out of the technology industry. ]

“The person above is right. YC, get out of the technology industry ”

“For a moment, the bullet screen was filled with comments about YC getting out of the technology industry. ” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Director Ma, Professor Feng, and the other two astronauts walked toward the east-west area. ”

“At this moment, director ma suggested, “Professor Feng, why don’t we take off our helmets?” ”

The helmets and spacesuits were connected to each other to provide oxygen.

“The Europa had a beautiful view of the mountains and rivers, and there was a colorful scene everywhere. There was no lack of oxygen at all, so it was unnecessary to wear the helmet. ”

“Professor Feng hesitated for a moment and then said, “Do you want to observe it? Jack, go to the spaceship and get the air detector.” ”

“Okay.”Jack nodded and walked into the spaceship.

“Soon, Jack came out of the spaceship with the air detector in his hand. ”

Professor Feng took the detector and began to test it.

Di —

The detector showed that the oxygen content of the Europa was 25% .

“In other words, on the Europa, humans could completely breathe on their own. After all, the oxygen content of the earth was only about 21% ! ”

“Seeing this result, professor Feng was very happy. “Director Ma, look.” ”

“Director Ma was also very excited. He immediately took off his helmet and said with a smile, “I have long complained that this thing is too heavy.” ”

“After taking off his helmet, director Ma took a deep breath of air. “Oh my God! The air on Europa is simply too sweet!”It was many times purer than on earth! ”

“After saying that, director Ma turned to look at Professor Feng and the other two astronauts. “You guys should also take off your helmets and give it a try!” ”

The other three also took off their helmets.

“Just as director Ma described, the air on Europa was very fresh and sweet, giving people a sense of intoxication. ”

[ I really want to stand on Europa and Breathe Fresh Air! ]

[ one more upstairs! ]

“[ hahaha, this is the planet full of danger that YC mentioned. I really want to see YC’s face now. ] ”

“[ I have to say, YC is indeed quite capable. Even in this state, there are still a bunch of people who support and believe in YC! If it were anyone else, they would have been spat at to death! ] ”

[ looks like we can implement the national relocation plan! Europa will be our beautiful home. ]

It could not be denied that everything on Europa was beautiful.

“Coincidentally, the spaceship landed on a mountain, and it was spring on Europa. ”

Everywhere was colorful.

It was like a Fairyland on Earth!

“At this time, Professor Feng, director Ma, and the others had already taken off their spacesuits and were walking freely on Europa. ”

The bullet screens were also filled with comments about the beautiful scenery of Europa.

At the same time.

At the CEN base.

Xu Gong and the others were also watching the live broadcast of C Nation.

“”Could it be that miss ye really made a mistake in her prediction? Europa is simply a small earth, how could there be any danger!” ”

“”If we had known earlier, we wouldn’t have gone to Mars to carry out some oasis plan. If we had landed on Europa, wouldn’t we have been able to solve all the problems!” ”

Worker Xu’s expression was also a little complicated.

He trusted ye Zao very much and had never doubted him.

“But now, the truth was right in front of him. ”

“Europa indeed did not have any problems. On the contrary, the sun was abundant, the mountains were clear, and the water was beautiful. It was suitable for survival, and there were also many resources. ”

“Cen Hai said, “Miss Ye is not a saint. It’s normal for her to make a mistake once in a while, right? Besides, Miss Ye’s motive is for our own good. She doesn’t want us to be in danger. After all, no one has ever landed on Europa.” ”

“Cen Hu nodded. “Si Hai is right. Miss ye is not a saint. Let’s understand more! If miss ye knew about this situation on Europa, she would definitely not stop us from landing on Europa.” ”

“However, there were still many people who were unhappy. ”

“”Seeing such good resources being occupied by C country, I feel quite upset.”If not for ye Zhuo’s words, the country that had successfully landed on Europa was China. But Now? They could only watch helplessly as C country seized the resources first. ”

“”Especially professor Feng and director Ma.”Gu Si stood up from her chair, “At that time, Professor Feng and director Ma both insisted that Europa was the second small earth, but no one believed them. At that time, they must have felt so wronged! “If it weren’t for Miss Ye’s objection to landing on Europa, the two of them wouldn’t have betrayed us!” ”
