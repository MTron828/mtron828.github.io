“”Want to run?”At the same time, a cold voice came from above. ”

“Wen Zhi’s body was covered in layers of cold sweat. When he looked up, he saw an ice-cold face. ”

It was Cen Hu.

“The Cen family’s base, the four brothers river, Lake, and sea were the ones that shouldn’t be provoked. ”

“It’s over, it’s over. ”

“Wen Zhi gulped and then said, “Cen, Cen Hu, what did you want to see me about?” ”

“At a time like this, he had to act as if nothing had happened. ”

“What did I want to see you about?”Cen Hu asked back.

“Wen Zhi continued, “No, I don’t know.” ”

“”You’ll know in a while.”Cen Hu let go of Wen Zhi’s hair and said to the two bodyguards beside him, “Take him away!” ”

“Yes.”

“As soon as he said that, Wen Zhi was picked up by the bodyguards on his left and right. ”

Wen Zhi was extremely flustered.

“If he was taken away, his life would be over. He had his elders and children, so he couldn’t be taken away. ”

“”Team leader Cen Hu, please let me off this time! I promise, I won’t dare to do it again...” ”

“Cen Hu glanced at him. “When you betrayed the base and Miss Ye, didn’t you think of today? Wen Zhi, you’re really good! If this were in the era of war, you’d be the number one traitor!” ”

“Wenzhi never dreamed that this day would come. If he had known this would happen, he wouldn’t have come back. He should have stayed in C nation. ”

“Ye Zhuo was still on Mars. As long as Cen Hu was willing to let him go, no one would find out anything. ”

“”Leader Cen Hu, in this world, who wouldn’t make mistakes? Please be magnanimous and forgive me this time, okay? As long as you let me go once, I’m willing to pay any price!” ”

Cen Hu did not say anything.

“Wen Zhi continued, “Leader Cen Hu, even if I did something wrong, my wife and children are innocent! Please bring them back from country C, okay? I’m begging you!” ”

“Once he was arrested, his wife and children who remained in country C would not be treated well. ”

“Moreover, other than him, no one in his family was proficient in foreign languages. Once they lost the help of country C, their entire family could only live on the streets. ”

“They did not know the language, and coupled with racial discrimination, one could imagine what kind of environment their family would have to face in the future. ”

No.

It could not be like this.

They had to immediately bring their family back from country C.

“In China, they at least had property and family. ”

“At this moment, Wen Zhi finally remembered the good things about his motherland. ”

Unfortunately.

It was too late.

“Cen Hu frowned slightly and continued, “If I remember correctly, your wife, children, and old are all of country C’s nationality now.” ”

“Hearing this, Wen Zhi’s heart skipped a beat. ”

“Back then, in order to completely escape the sanctions of China and to become a citizen of Country V, he had changed the nationality of his entire family to Chinese nationals. ”

“Cen Hu continued, “China has no right to take back any Chinese nationals.” ”

Only by possessing a Chinese identity card could one enjoy the protection of China.

“At this moment, Wen Zhi was extremely regretful of his decision back then. ”

He should not have felt that he could deceive ye Zhuo.

He should not have changed his nationality even more.

“Almost in an instant, Wen Zhi burst into tears and said, “I was wrong! Leader Cen Hu, I was really wrong. Please help me think of a way! Let my wife and children return to China...” ”

“Cen Hu was not some reincarnation of his biological mother. He did not feel that Wen Zhi was pitiful at all, “From the moment you decided to betray Miss Ye, you should have thought of today. You did not even think about your wife and children. Why should you let others pay for your actions?” ” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Wen Zhi’s face was withered.

“If he could turn back time, he would definitely not choose this path. ”

He thought that he could deceive ye Zhuo and ruin the oasis project. He did not expect that ye Zhuo was the final BOSS.

The clown was himself.

At the same time.

“After visiting Mars for half an hour, the group landed on the aircraft carrier and returned to Earth. ”

Mi Jiadi and the two professors from C Nation were completely dumbfounded.

“In fact, most of them did not look good. Only a few of them had smiles on their faces. ”

“Not long after, the aircraft carrier successfully landed on Earth. ”

Everyone returned to the open-air square.

“Ye Zao stood on the stage and gave a concluding speech. Then, he turned to look at Mi Jiadi, who was already pale. “Dr. Mi Jiadi, shouldn’t we fulfill the terms of the bet agreement now?” ”

The terms of the bet agreement?

“Hearing this, Mi Jiadi, who was already pale, had no color on his face. ”

“He had wanted to burn the leaves, but had not thought to lift a stone and hit his own feet. ”

Is it too late to back out now?
