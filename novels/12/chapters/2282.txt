“Chen Yaojun massaged his temples and did not say anything. “Now that Bai Jingshu has not shown up, this matter is a little tricky.” ”

“”You and your father, one is a deputy governor and the other is a detective. Is there nothing you can do?”Madam Chen asked. ”

“Chen Yaojun shook his head. “A new official has been appointed to the post three times. Now that the investigation is at its strictest, the slightest carelessness will bring disaster upon us! Mother, have you forgotten about the Zhao Family?” ”

“When the Zhao family was mentioned, Mrs. Chen’s expression changed. In the past, she had the best relationship with Mrs. Zhao. Ever since Zhao youguo was removed from power, she had never seen Mrs. Zhao again. ”

“What should we do now? Just watch Yao Sheng be locked up for ten years?”Mrs. Chen asked.

Chen Yaojun did not say anything.

“As his brother, he did not want to see such an outcome. However, there was nothing he could do now. ”

“Chen Jinyan continued, “He will learn from his mistakes. Let him suffer this time. Let’s see if he dares to do anything again!” ”

“Ten years! Are you going to watch Yaosheng suffer for ten years?”Madam Chen asked.

“Chen Jinyan said helplessly, “So what if I don’t have the heart? He is breaking the law now! A prince breaking the law is the same as a commoner!” ”

“”Dad, Mom, don’t worry.”Chen Yaojun continued, “The difficulty is only temporary. Let yaosheng perform well in there first. If he performs well, his sentence can be reduced.” ”

Madam Chen’s face turned pale.

“Chen Jinyan sighed again. These days, because of Chen Yaosheng’s matter, his hair was almost half done up, “When the news reaches the end of the bridge, everything will be fine. Our children and grandchildren will have their own blessings. We have done what needs to be done. I will go and take care of it so that he doesn’t feel so uncomfortable in there.” ”

“Upon hearing this, Madam Chen’s emotions completely collapsed. She hugged Chen Jinyan and burst into tears. ”

Chen Jinyan could only Pat Madam Chen on the back to comfort her silently.

“Since things had come to this, they could only do this. ”

“Before the court verdict was announced, Chen Jinyan found a time to meet Chen Yaosheng. ”

“When he saw Chen Jinyan, Chen Yaosheng was extremely excited. “Dad, Dad! Are you here to bring me home? I can go home now, right?” ”

Chen Yaosheng had always been pampered. He had never suffered like this before. He could not wait to leave this place immediately.

“Seeing Chen Yaosheng like this, Chen Jinyan sighed. “Not yet.” ”

“Why?”Chen Yaosheng asked.

“Chen Jinyan continued, “Tell me honestly, what exactly is going on between you and Bai Jingshu?” ”

“Chen Yao was furious when he recalled what had happened that night, “Bai Jingshu, it was all because of that woman Bai Jingshu who set me up! If it wasn’t for her, I wouldn’t have ended up like this! and Lin Ze, that B * Stard couple! Dad, you must avenge me!” ”

“Lin Ze?”Chen Jinyan frowned.

“Yes! It’s him!”Chen Yaosheng nodded hurriedly. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Chen Jinyan continued, “Who is Lin Ze?” ”

“Chen yaosheng said, “Lin Ze is an earthling, but I don’t think he is an ordinary earthling...”how could an ordinary earthling have such explosive power that even his steel armor was cracked! ”

“Where is your memory chip?”Chen Jinyan asked.

“In the General Alliance, everyone had a memory chip when they were born. The memory chip was like a miniature monitor that could record every day of the past ten years. ”

“Speaking of this, it was a disgrace to Chen Yaosheng. His hands were clenched into fists. ”

“What happened?”Chen Jinyan asked.

“Chen yaosheng continued, “My memory chip was destroyed by Lin Ze during the fight!” ”

“What?”Chen Jinyan asked.

“Chen yaosheng said angrily, “I am sure that Lin Ze is not an ordinary person. Otherwise, he would not be able to beat me! Dad, you must avenge me!” ”

Chen Jinyan frowned slightly and did not say anything.

“Seeing his father like this, Chen Yaosheng asked again, “Dad, when can I go out?” ”

“Although Chen Jinyan had said that he could not take him back for the time being, based on Chen Jinyan’s position in the alliance, he would definitely be able to bail him out as soon as possible. ”

“”Yaosheng, you have to be mentally prepared.”Chen Jinyan looked at Chen Yaosheng. ”

“Hearing this, Chen Yaosheng’s heart skipped a beat. “Dad, what do you mean?” ”

“”The court will give you a minimum sentence of ten years,”Chen Jinyan continued. ”

“”What?”Hearing this, Chen Yaosheng’s face instantly turned pale. ”

“Ten, ten years? ”

How could this be?
