“If they were allowed to continue spreading the news like this, if nothing happened to her and Si Lu, it would become something!”

It was fine to let others hear it.

What if Master Five’s people heard it?

“Looking at the name list that Zhao Xueyin handed over, the person in charge was stunned. “Why, why?””

There was a reason for firing someone. It was definitely not appropriate to fire someone for no reason like Zhao Xueyin.

Zhao Xueyin glanced at Annie.

Annie immediately took out her tablet and brought up the cloud surveillance.

“On the surveillance, the people on the 57th floor were still gathered together and chatting.”

“Seeing this, the person-in-charge’s heart thumped.”

Not Good!

“Zhao Xueyin said with a cold face, “The consortium invited them over to chat? If I find out about this again in the future, your job as the person-in-charge will come to an end!””

“The person-in-charge was so scared that his face turned pale. He hurriedly nodded and said, “Okay, Miss Zhao, I’ll do it right away!””

Zhao Xueyin waved her hand. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

The person-in-charge turned around and walked out.

“Looking at the back of the person-in-charge, the anger in Zhao Xueyin’s eyes dissipated a little.”

...

On the other side.

The lawyer moved to the 30th floor.

“Although he had lost a few levels in a row, to the lawyer, as long as he could protect Zhao Xueyin and not let her get hurt, this was nothing.”

“At this moment, his phone suddenly rang. Si lei swiped to pick it up. “Hello.””

“Brother Yu.”Yang Wenhao’s voice came from the other end of the screen. “I’ve already made an appointment for you with drink.”

“Really?”Si Lei’s eyes lit up.

“Yang Wenhao smiled and said, “Would I joke with you about something like this? Rebecca and I have an appointment to meet at three o’clock the day after tomorrow.””

“Where is the meeting place?”The lawyer asked.

“Yang Wenhao said, “In shallow drink’s studio.””

“Then.., yang Wenhao added, “By the way, brother Yu, Rebecca told me that shallow drink likes desserts. If you bring desserts with you, shallow drink will definitely agree. Remember to bring the limited edition desserts!””

“”Okay, Wenhao, thank you.””

“”There’s no need to say thank you between US Brothers.”Yang Wenhao paused for a moment before continuing, “Brother Yu, you were demoted in Shunxi Financial Group?””

Si Lu nodded.

“Yang Wenhao said, “Brother Yu, based on my understanding of you, you shouldn’t make such a low-level mistake. You... you’re doing this for Miss Zhao, right?””

“Yes.”Si Lu did not deny it.

“Yang Wenhao sighed. “Brother Yu, do you know that these files will follow you for the rest of your life! Is it really worth it for you to do this? If Miss Zhao really cares about you, do you think she would push you out to take the blame?””

Si lui could not be bothered to explain too much to an idiot like Yang Wenhao.

“One day, the truth would come out.”

“No matter how much he said now, it was just a waste of his breath.”

“”She did not push me to take the blame. I did everything willingly,”Si lui said concisely.”

“Yang Wenhao said, “I know that! Brother Yu, do you know what the highest realm of the White Lotus Flower Is?””

“Who are you calling the White Lotus Flower?”Si lui frowned.

“Since they were on the phone, Yang Wenhao was not afraid of Si lui, then, he said, “The highest realm of the white lotus flower is that no matter what she asks you to do, you feel honored. You are willing to pay for her! “In fact, in their eyes, you are just a spare tire, a scapegoat!””

“After returning yesterday, Old Master Jin found Yang Wenhao again.”

“Looking at the information given by Old Master Jin, Yang Wenhao was even more certain that Zhao Xueyin was a white lotus flower!”

What Si Lui did was not worth it at all!

Si lui directly cut off Yang Wenhao’s phone call.

“Looking at the phone that was hung up, Yang Wenhao sighed helplessly.”

“”Big Brother Si, who are you so angry with?”Zhao Xueyin’s voice sounded from behind.”

“Si lui turned around and smiled, “Nothing.””

“Zhao Xueyin looked at the surrounding environment and said with some self-blame, “Big Brother Si, I’m really sorry, because I implicated you...””

“Before she could finish her sentence, she was interrupted by Si lui, “It’s too polite to say that I dragged you into this! Oh right, I have good news for you.””

“What Good News?”Zhao Xueyin raised her head and asked.

“Si lui continued, “My friend has already contacted shallow drink?””

“Really?”Zhao Xueyin’s eyes lit up.

“Yes.”Si lui nodded. “The appointment is at three o’clock in the afternoon the day after tomorrow. I’ll see you at shallow drink’s studio.”

“Okay!”

“The lawyer continued, “In addition, Rebecca, shallow drink’s assistant, said that shallow drink is a good dessert. When you go, it’s best to bring a limited edition dessert. That way, you’ll get twice the result with half the effort!””
