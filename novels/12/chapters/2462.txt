Song Shiyu shook his head. “It’s nothing.”

“Doctor Liu took out his stethoscope, then he said, “Mr. Bai, you and boss song have been good friends for many years. Please advise boss song! His current body really can’t eat carelessly anymore! If this goes on, his body will collapse!” ”

“Did you eat carelessly again?”Bai Jiayu looked at song Shiyu.

Song Shiyu didn’t say anything.

“Bai Jiayu was a little speechless and said, “Third brother, you can’t do this! Why Don’t you listen to the Doctor’s advice!” ”

“”I know my own body very well.”Song Shiyu continued, “Don’t be alarmist here.” ” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Bai Jiayu said, “How can you be as clear as the Doctor?” ”

Song Shiyu looked at Doctor Liu. “Give me more painkillers today.”

“Doctor Liu said, “Did you finish all the painkillers that were prescribed yesterday?” ”

Song Shiyu did not say anything.

“Doctor Liu Sighed. “Mr. Song, I’m not trying to scare you. You really have to take care of yourself. Your current condition is very bad...” ”

“Before he could finish his sentence, he was interrupted by song Shiyu. “Alright, I understand. Have you prescribed the painkillers?” ”

Doctor Liu nodded. “Yes.”

“Song Shiyu continued, “Take it to the butler.” ”

Doctor Liu took the prescription and went to look for the butler.

“Bai Jiayu looked at Doctor Liu’s back and turned to look at song Shiyu, he said very seriously, “Third brother, I think that liking someone means being able to see her happiness with your own eyes. If you really love the person in your heart, take good care of your body and then love and protect her. “Life is neither long nor short, and people are fickle. If one day, the woman in Your Goddess’heart betrays your goddess and bullies her, you can still stand up for your goddess. “But if you’re not here, who will protect your goddess?” ”

“Song Shiyu was stunned for a moment, and his gaze was deep. ”

“Bai Jiayu stood up. “Third brother, I have to go. Think about what I said to you.” ”

“After saying that, Bai Jiayu turned around and left. ”

Song Shiyu looked at Bai Jiayu’s back with a complicated expression.

No one could understand what he was thinking.

On the other side.

“After Bai Jiayu returned, old master Chen immediately called him to ask. ”

“After learning the final result, Old Master Chen was so angry that he slammed the microphone on the ground. ”

What the hell!

“He had mentioned this matter in front of Song Shiyu several times, but Song Shiyu had rejected him again and again! ”

Did song Shiyu really not care about their friendship in the past?

“”Old Master, please calm down. Don’t be angry!”The Butler immediately held old master Chen and comforted him. ”

“Old Master Chen said angrily, “If it weren’t for me, he wouldn’t be a thing! He still doesn’t like Yaoyao now. What right does he have to not like Yaoyao?” ”

“Old Master Chen sighed, then, he continued, “Actually, I can understand if he doesn’t like Yaoyao. After all, everyone has their own taste. Everyone has their own love, but Yaoyao is my granddaughter after all! He has to give me some face!” ”

“However, not only did song Shiyu not give him face, he even pushed his face to the ground and stomped on it! ”

“Moreover, he was a person who was about to die. ”

“The Butler looked at Old Master Chen and continued, “Old Master, our eldest miss is so outstanding, what kind of person can’t marry her? It’s his loss that song Shiyu is unwilling. You, don’t be angry about this!” ”
