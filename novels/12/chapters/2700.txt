“Yao Cuifen leaned back in her chair and suddenly thought of something. She then said, “Oh right, have you asked little spike?” ”

“Asked what?”Ye Dafu asked.

“Yao cuifen then said, “Ask if that B * Stard has really struck it rich outside!” ”

Ye Dafu shook his head. “I didn’t ask.”

“”Then why don’t you ask!”Yao Cuifen was very anxious. She then said, “Hurry up and ask now. Take out your phone.” ”

Ye Dafu took out his phone and was about to make a call. “Didn’t you hear what someone said just now! You Can’t make calls on the plane!”

“Why can’t you make calls on the plane?”Yao Cuifen asked.

It was her first time on a plane and she didn’t know anything.

“Then how would I know!”Ye Dafu said.

“Yao cuifen continued, “That B * Stard is really heartless. After so many years, he still doesn’t know how to take us over and show US filial piety!” ”

“Do you know what the most important thing for us to go over this time is?”Ye Dafu asked.

“What?”Yao Cuifen asked.

“”Money,”ye Dafu answered. ”

“If they confirmed that ye Shu had really become a rich lady, then they would definitely need more money to go back. ”

“Ye dafu continued, “Shuai Shuai won’t be out for another ten years. We have to leave a way out for little treasure.” ”

Little Treasure was ye Shuai’s son.

Yao Cuifen nodded. “You’re right. How much do we need then?”

“Ye Dafu narrowed his eyes and continued, “That depends on where little treasure will work in the future. When we get to Beijing, we’ll give little treasure a call and see what he says.” ” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Okay.”Yao Cuifen nodded.

“Four hours later, the plane stopped at the Beijing Airport. ”

Ye Sui and Zhou Ziyue came to pick them up personally.

“”Dad, MOM, over here!”Seeing ye Dafu and Yao Cuifen, they immediately waved. ”

“Spiky!”

Yao Cuifen ran over excitedly.

“”Mom, how was the journey?”Ye Sui smiled and said, “Did it go well?” ”

“”It went well!”Yao cuifen nodded and looked around, then said, “Just the two of you?” ”

“Who else do you want?”Ye Sui asked back.

“Yao cuifen continued, “She didn’t come with you?” ”

Her?

“Ye Sui was puzzled. He suddenly thought of something and said, “Mom, Stop Dreaming! Do you think ye Shu will come to pick you and Dad Up?” ”

“At this point, ye Sui changed his tone. “Stop Dreaming! She is now a rich lady with bodyguards and a driver. There are dozens of nannies at home. Why would she come to pick you up? What are you thinking!” ”

“Hearing this, Yao Cui Fen immediately widened her eyes. “So it’s true?” ”

“What’s true?”Ye Sui asked.

“Yao Cui Fen continued, “Did that wretched girl really find a rich man?” ”

“”Not just rich! She has power! She’s very powerful anyway!”Speaking up to this point, ye Sui sighed. “From now on, we’re not from the same world as her!” ”

“How are we not from the same world? I’m her mother! I’ll always be her mother!”Yao Cuifen put her hands on her hips. “So What? Does she still dare to disown me?”

“Yao Cuifen’s voice was especially loud, causing the passengers at the airport to look over, their eyes full of curiosity. ”

“Zhou Ziyue put down her phone and noticed the expressions on everyone’s faces. She reached out and tugged at Yao Cuifen’s arm. “Grandma, Please Lower Your Voice. There are so many people watching!” ”

A country bumpkin was indeed a country bumpkin! She had no experience at all!

Could the airport be a place for her to make a racket?

“If she did not really need Yao Cuifen, Zhou Ziyue would not have provoked such a person no matter what she said. ”

“”So what if I’m making a racket! If they have the ability, then let the police come and arrest me! What a joke! Now they don’t even allow people to speak?”Yao Cuifen said. ”

“As soon as she said this, more and more people looked over. ”

“Zhou Ziyue wanted to find a hole to hide in, so she had to hold Yao Cuifen’s arm. “Grandma, Let’s Go First!” ”

“What? Why are you talking so quietly? I don’t owe them money!”Yao Cuifen glared at the crowd. “What are you looking at!”

“Ye Sui’s face was also a little embarrassed. He pulled Yao Cuifen and walked out. “Let’s go, let’s go.” ”

Yao Cuifen cursed and walked forward. She wished she could greet everyone’s ancestors a few times.

How dare she meddle in her business!

“Soon, they arrived at the hotel. ”

“”Mom, I’ve booked a room for You and Dad. You can stay next door to us. If you two need anything, just knock on the door.” ”

“”Stay in a hotel? Why do you need a hotel?”Yao Cuifen glared at ye Sui. “It’s fine if that ungrateful ye Shu doesn’t come to pick me up, but now he wants me to stay in a hotel?” ”

“I’ve already said it. Ye Shu is a rich lady now. How could she have time to talk to you?”

“Yao Cuifen was so angry that she cursed, “This ungrateful...” ”

Yao Cuifen’s ability to curse made ye Sui’s scalp go numb.

How could she be so good at scolding people? !

“”Okay, okay,”Zhou Ziyue said with a smile, “Grandma, don’t worry. I have a way to make little aunt come to pick you up and live a good life.” ”

“Hearing that, Yao Cuifen’s eyes lit up and she immediately asked, “What Way?” ”

“You don’t need to know what way for the time being. You just need to listen to my arrangements.”Zhou Ziyue remained mysterious.

“Yao cuifen glanced at Zhou Ziyue. “Okay, okay, okay. Ziyue, I’ll listen to your arrangements.” ”

“Zhou ziyue nodded and continued, “You and Grandpa have been on the plane for so long. You must be tired. Rest first. I’ll send your lunch over later.” ”

“”Okay.”Yao cuifen nodded lovingly and said with a smile, “We, ziyue, are the most sensible! As expected of someone who went to university!” ”

“Ye dafu continued, “Ziyue, what are you thinking about? Can you tell Grandpa About It?” ”

“Zhou ziyue smiled and said, “Grandpa, you and Grandma are old and it’s not suitable for you to work hard. So, let me do this kind of thing. You and Grandma just wait to hear my good news.” ”

“”That’s fine.”Ye Dafu was very satisfied with Zhou Ziyue’s answer and said with a smile, “Ziyue has really grown up.” ”

“Zhou ziyue said, “Grandpa, please go in and rest with Grandma. By the way, what do you want to eat for lunch? My mom and I will go buy it for you.” ”

“Just eat something for lunch. Your Grandma and I are not that particular people.”

“Zhou Ziyue nodded. “Alright then. Grandpa, you and Grandma should get some rest. My mom and I will not disturb you.” ”

“After saying that, Zhou Ziyue grabbed ye Sui’s hand and left the room. ”

“After leaving, ye Sui curiously asked Wen Zhou ziyue, “What can you do? ! Now That Your Grandpa and Grandma Are Here, you should tell me, right?” ”

“These days, Zhou Ziyue refused to tell her anything. Ye Sui was really worried to death! ”

“Zhou ziyue said impatiently, “I told you not to ask so many questions.” ”

“Ye Sui glanced at Zhou Ziyue and did not ask any more questions, but she was still curious, she continued, “Let me tell you, your grandmother is not someone to be trifled with. If you provoke them now and fail to take advantage of them, you will suffer!” ”

What kind of person was Yao Cuifen?

A typical shrew!

She did not acknowledge anyone other than her son and grandson!

“Not to mention Zhou Ziyue, even if it was her daughter, Yao Cuifen could turn hostile at any time. ”

“Zhou Ziyue had a confident look on her face. “Don’t worry, I know what to do.” ”

“”As long as you know what to do.”Ye Sui continued, “Then what do you plan to do next?” ”

“Zhou Ziyue narrowed her eyes and continued, “You should ask ye Shu about that!” ”

“Ask ye Shu?”Ye Sui was stunned.

“”Yeah.”Zhou ziyue continued, “She’s about to be in big trouble.” ”

Ye Sui couldn’t understand what Zhou Ziyue was saying at all.

“”Let’s go,”Zhou Ziyue continued. ”

“Where are we going?”Ye Sui asked.

“Zhou ziyue said, “We’re going to buy food first, then we’re going to record a video.” ”

“Record what video?”Ye Sui was even more confused.

Zhou Ziyue smiled. “A video that will ruin ye Shu’s reputation.”

“Ye Sui wanted to ask more, but Zhou ziyue continued, “You just have to cooperate with me. Knowing too much is not good for my plan.” ”

“When she said this, ye Sui immediately stopped asking. He just said, “Okay, okay, okay. I Won’t ask anymore.” ”

The mother and daughter went outside to buy food.

“After dinner.., zhou ziyue said, “Grandpa and Grandma, I Have Something to tell you. You have to do as I say. Only by doing as I say can ye Shu come to take you back willingly and show respect to you.” ”

“”Okay, okay, okay.”Yao Cuifen immediately nodded. “Ziyue, you say it. Your Grandpa and I will listen to you.” ”

Zhou Ziyue took out her phone. “I will record a video for you guys in a while...”

“After finishing her sentence, Yao Cuifen was overjoyed. “This university student is really different. He speaks in a clear and logical manner. Ziyue, hurry up and record it!” ”
