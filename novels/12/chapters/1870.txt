“Although it was only a short half an hour, he ziteng felt that it was as long as half a century. ”

“After all, he had gained a lot in half an hour. ”

Xu Yao was still drunk as she sat in the passenger seat. “Where are we going now?”

“”To send you home,”he ziteng said. ”

“OH.”

“Because Xu Yao was drunk, he ziteng drove very slowly. It was not until an hour later that the car stopped at the He family’s villa. ”

He ziteng supported Xu Yao with one hand and pressed the doorbell with the other.

“Soon, the door opened. ” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The person who opened the door was none other than mother Xu.

“Seeing mother Xu, he ziteng said politely, “Hello, Auntie. I’m he ziteng. Yaoyao was drunk at her friend’s birthday party. I’ll send her back.” ”

He ziteng!

This was he ziteng!

Mother Xu was very excited.

He ziteng actually personally sent Xu Yao back.

“But mother Xu still did not show her excitement. She frowned slightly and said, “Why is this child still drunk!” ”

“After saying that, she looked at he ziteng and continued, “Thank you for sending her back, young man.” ”

“Hearing that, he ziteng immediately reacted. The person in front of him was definitely Xu Yao’s mother. “Auntie, you’re too polite. We’re all friends. It’s only right to help each other.” ”

“Mother Xu took Xu Yao from he ziteng’s hands and continued, “Young Man, come in and have a seat!” ”

“It was already late at night, and he Ziteng didn’t bring any gifts. How could he have the face to come in and have a seat? “Thank you, Aunty. It’s too late today. Another day, another day, I’ll definitely visit you and uncle. I’ll be leaving first.” ”

“Mother Xu smiled and said, “It’s dark at night. Young man, drive carefully.” ”

“”I know, Aunty,”he ziteng said. ”

“Seeing he ziteng get into the car, mother Xu finally freed her hand to close the courtyard door. ”

“Not long after, the sound of a car engine came from outside. ”

“Seeing that Xu Yao was still drunk, mother xu said, “She left.” ”

“Hearing this, Xu Yao immediately woke up. She looked at the large iron gate of the courtyard and said, “She left?” ”

“”Yes.”Mother Xu nodded and asked, “How was it?” ”

“”It was alright.”Xu Yao continued, “Mom, with how infatuated he ziteng is with me right now, even if I’m not pregnant, he won’t change his mind.” ”

“”You don’t understand,”mother Xu said. “Men are hot for three minutes. Don’t think that he’s treating you well now! After this novelty, he won’t be so good anymore! When that time comes, you won’t even have a place to cry.” ”

“When Xu Chaonan drove back, he happened to bump into he ziteng’s car. ”

“Seeing this, Xu Chaonan frowned slightly. ”

“After returning home, Xu Chaonan came to Xu Yao’s room. “Yaoyao.” ”

“”Auntie.”Seeing Xu Chaonan enter, Xu Yao immediately stood up from her chair. ”

“Xu Chaonan continued, “I saw the he family’s car just now. was he ziteng the one who sent you back?” ”

“Yes.”Xu Yao nodded.

“Xu Chaonan looked at Xu Yao and continued, “Yaoyao, you and he ziteng are really not the same person. Even if you can get past he ziteng, you won’t be able to get past the he family’s parents!” ”

“As an aunt, Xu Chaonan really could not watch as Xu Yao walked into the Abyss step by step. ”

“The He family’s parents were very astute people. With just Xu Yao’s little tricks, the He family’s parents could tell at a glance! When the time came, Xu Yao would be the one suffering. ”

Xu Yao snorted coldly in her heart.

Her mother was right. Xu Chaonan was jealous of her. Xu Chaonan did not want her to marry better at all!

A person like Xu Chaonan was too scary!

She could not get married and now she had to stop her niece from getting married.

It was simply disgusting.

“Xu Yao did not show it on her face at all, she continued, “Aunt, I know that you’re doing this for my own good, but relationships are always like fish drinking water. You know your own feelings. I like he ziteng, and he ziteng can’t do it without me. Why Can’t We Be Together?” ”

Xu Chaonan frowned slightly. “Do you really like he ziteng?”

“”Absolutely,”Xu Yao said. ”

“Seeing Xu Yao like this, Xu Chaonan didn’t say anything more. He continued, “Yaoyao, I’ll say it again. Aunt will always respect your choice. The prerequisite is that you don’t regret it.” ”

Regret?

Being able to marry into the he family was a blessing that she had cultivated for countless lifetimes. Why would she regret it?

She looked at Xu Chaonan on purpose.

He was just scaring her!

“Xu Yao smiled at Xu Chaonan and said very seriously, “Aunt, don’t worry. I will never regret it.” ”
