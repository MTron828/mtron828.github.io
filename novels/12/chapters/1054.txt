“About half an hour later, ye Zao walked out of the bathroom. She was dressed in white sportswear, which made her look neat and agile. Her whole body was filled with a youthful aura. She had always been well-dressed, but when it came to her.., it became a human shirt. No matter what style it was, as long as she wore it, it would become very high-class. ”

Ye Zao went downstairs to the garden for a run.

“As soon as she reached the garden, she saw Lin ze carrying brother Meow into the garden. ”

“”Good morning, brother.” ”

“”Good Morning,”Lin ze continued, “Zao, wait a moment.” ”

“What’s Wrong?”Ye Zao stopped in her tracks.

“At this time, Lin Ze bent down and very naturally helped ye Zao tie her shoelaces. “Your shoelaces are untied.” ”

“Ye Zao said a little embarrassedly, “Brother, I can do it myself.” ”

“Okay.”Lin Ze quickly tied his shoelaces and stood up.

“”Thank you, Brother.” ” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“No problem.”

“Ye Zao finished a lap at exactly 7:30 pm. She took out her phone and opened wechat. She thought that after opening wechat, she would receive Zhao Pingting’s wechat message on time. However, in the chat list, other than Cen Shaoqing’s message.., there was no other message from anyone else. ”

Something seemed to be wrong. Ye Zhuo frowned slightly.

“According to Zhao Pingting’s habits, she should be running as well. Moreover, Ye Zhuo had sent her a voice message last night. She said that she was busy and would chat later. If it was the usual Zhao Pingting.., she would definitely send her a message as soon as she finished her run in the morning. ”

“However, there was no news from Zhao Pingting today. ”

Ye Zao frowned slightly and opened Zhao Pingting’s chat box. [ is doggie around? ]

[ doggie ] is around. ]

This chat style was no different from Zhao Pingting’s usual style. Ye Zao then sent her a message. [ is it convenient to video chat? ]

[ uh... it might not be too convenient... ]

“Ye Zhuo felt that something was wrong even more. [ alright! Doggie, didn’t you say that you were going back to your hometown tomorrow? Do you want me to send you? ] ”

“The perverted man on the other end of the screen narrowed his eyes and replied, [ no need, I can go back by myself. ] ”

“Seeing this message, Ye Zhuo’s heart skipped a beat. ”

Something had happened!

Something must have happened to Zhao Pingting because Zhao Pingting had never said that she was going home. The reason why she asked this was just to test the other party.

Ye Zao immediately switched the phone page to the phone page and quickly called the police. He then informed an Lizi of the news.

“An Lizi’s face turned pale when she heard the news. She hurriedly took a car to the Lin family’s house. “Zao Zao, don’t Scare Me! Is Pingting really missing? Could it be related to the recent serial murder case?” ”

“”No, don’t make wild guesses! I’ve already called the Police!”Ye Zhuozhuo turned on his computer and tried to locate Zhao Pingting’s cell phone’s location. ”

“Since the other party had Zhao Pingting’s cell phone and used Zhao Pingting’s tone to reply to her, this person must be with Zhao Pingting. ”

“An Lizi spun around anxiously. “Zhuozhuo, is there anything I can help you with?” ”

“Ye Zao searched for the location on his phone and said, “Do you have the phone number of Ping Ting’s childhood friend? Call her and ask her.” ”

“An Lizi said, “I don’t know the number of her childhood friend either! By the way, does Ping Ting’s parents know about this?” ”

“I don’t think so for the time being.”

“An lizi continued, “Then should we tell uncle and Auntie about this? They must know Ping Ting’s childhood friend’s number!” ”

This was indeed not a small matter. Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Then quickly inform uncle and Aunty.”

An Lizi picked up the phone and was about to make a call when ye Zao’s phone rang. Ye Zao pressed the mouse with one hand and picked up the phone with the other. “Hello!”

“”Is, is that Zao Zao?”An anxious female voice came from the other end of the screen. “Zao Zao, this is Pingting’s mother! I just received a call from the police station saying that Pingting is missing. Is It True?” ”

“Recently, there had been more and more fraudulent calls. Mother Zhao thought that she had received a call from a swindler. However, she was worried that something had really happened to Pingting, so she thought of calling ye Zhuo to ask. ”

“”It’s true.”Ye Zhuo briefly told Mother Zhao about what happened last night. After Mother Zhao heard it, she cried on the spot. ”

“Ye zhuo comforted her, “Auntie, don’t be anxious. Calm down! Maybe Ping Ting is playing with us! You should contact Ping Ting’s childhood friend and ask her if she knows anything about Ping Ting. Then we will keep in touch.” ”
