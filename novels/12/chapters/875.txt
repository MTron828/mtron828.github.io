“Ye Zao smiled and said, “This is their usual style.” ”

“At this moment, Old Mrs. Cen suddenly picked up her phone and said excitedly, “Ye, these hands are yours, right?” ”

Ye Zao looked up and saw that the screen was playing the scene of her cooking.

“It’s me.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Although Old Mrs. Cen recognized ye Zao’s hand at a glance, the fans on the bullet screen did not recognize it. [ Ahhh! This is Chenyu’s hand! ] ”

[ I love you! Chenyu who can cook is so charming! ]

[ I knew Chenyu could cook. This episode’s guests will have a good time. ]

“[ Ahhh! Finally, it’s the second season of ‘country’! ] ”

[ Chenyu is so amazing! His knife skills are like those of a martial artist! ]

Almost all the bullet screens were filled with song Chenyu’s fans.

“Old Mrs. Cen said angrily, “Why is this ugly fish everywhere! This is obviously my granddaughter-in-law’s hand!” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Grandma Cen, don’t be angry. I just joined ‘The Village’, so it’s normal that no one knows me. After the show airs, the truth will be revealed.” ”

“Hearing ye Zao’s words, Old Mrs. Cen felt much better. “Then I’ll forgive that ugly fish this time! Let’s Eat!” ”

“It was already five o’clock in the evening when they came out of the Food Street. There was a movie theater nearby. Ye Zao suddenly remembered that she had never watched a movie with old Mrs. Cen before, so he continued, “Grandma Cen, Let’s go watch a movie?” ”

“”Sure!”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “I heard that there’s a big movie that’s very good recently.” ”

...

Time passed very quickly.

“In the blink of an eye, three days had passed. ”

Friday.

“The variety show that ye Zao was participating in, “The village,”was going to be broadcast tonight. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen was very excited. She called all the CEN sisters back, saying that there was a big announcement to be made. ”

“Cen yuying smiled and said, “Grandma, what big announcement do you have to make? Why are you making it so Grand?” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen looked back at the clock and continued, “Yezi went to participate in a variety show a few days ago. It will be broadcast at Eight o’clock Tonight, so I called all of you back. Let’s watch Yezi on TV together.” ”

“Hearing this, Cen Yuyan’s eyes flashed with ridicule. ”

“She knew that Ye Zhuo had gone to participate in “The village.”After all, Song Chenyu was also one of the guests. ”

“”The village”was not an ordinary variety show. There was no script, and there were no lines. It was a test of an actor’s ability to adapt and be professional. ”

“For a person like ye Zhuo who was not famous, had no acting experience, and did not know anything, he would only embarrass himself if he went. ”

Celebrities and internet celebrities were not on the same level.

Celebrities relied on their strength and acting skills to conquer their fans.

Internet celebrities only needed to twist a few times in front of the camera and call him Big Brother.

Cen Yuyan could almost imagine how ye Zao had embarrassed himself on the program team.

Cen Yuyan would not have come back if she did not want to see ye Zao embarrass himself.

“The Worse Ye Zao performed in front of the camera, the more favorable it would be for song Chenyu. ”

“Otherwise, old Mrs. Cen and the Cen family would never see song Chenyu’s good side! ”

Cen Yuyan took a photo and sent it to Song Chenyu. [ our whole family is waiting for ‘village’to start broadcasting at 8 o’clock. ]

Song Chenyu probably had something to do and didn’t reply immediately.

“When she heard what old Mrs. Cen said, Cen Yueya immediately jumped up from the sofa, ”

“Really? Yezi went to participate in a variety show? When did this happen? Why haven’t I heard anything about it?”

“Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “It happened not too long ago. You guys were too busy, so Yezi didn’t say anything.” ”

Ye Zhuo kept a very low profile.

It was not that he liked to publicize whenever he encountered something.

“CEN yueying said, “Grandma, is ye Zao participating in director Feng’s ‘country’?” ”

“Yes.”Old Mrs. Cen nodded. “It’s ‘country’.”

“Cen yueying smiled and said, “I chased after ‘country’last year! I didn’t Expect Zao Zao to participate today! Right, is Zao Zao going to attack the entertainment industry in the future?” ”

“”No.”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Doesn’t ye Zao have a media company? She’s participating in the program to increase the company’s popularity.” ”

“”Oh, I see.”CEN yueying nodded. ”

Cen Yuyan curled her lips.

Increase her popularity?

She felt that it was more like blacklisting the company.

“At this moment, Song Chenyu replied, [ really? ] ”

[ of course it’s true. ]

“When she learned that the Cen family were watching country on television, song Chenyu was very excited. ”

“This time, country would definitely let the CEN family see a different version of her. ”

As for Ye Zhuo?

She could only use him as a stepping stone!

“Song Chenyu and Ye Zhuo were not on the same team, so she did not know about ye Zhuo’s performance. ”

“However, it was easy to imagine that ye Zhuo must have been extremely ugly. ”

“If “The village”had a script, Ye Zhuo could still act along with it. ”

“However, the problem was that “The village”did not have a script at all. ”

“Ye Zao didn’t know anything, and the actors she worked with didn’t like her. ”

It was too difficult for ye Zao to perform well in country!

“If ye Zao really had any outstanding performance, the trailer would have been released the day before yesterday, and Ye Zao’s face wouldn’t have been hidden. ”

Time passed by minute by minute.

“Soon, it was eight o’clock. ”

“Country”was broadcast on the banana station on time.

“It’s on! It’s on!”Old Mrs. Cen was very excited.

The CEN sisters were also very excited and focused on the big screen.

“At the beginning of the camera, it was a small farm yard. ”

The environment in the yard was very beautiful.

The camera zoomed back and could see the geographical location of the entire East continent.

“”Finally, it’s the second season of “Country”.” ”

“Punch in from the front row!”

“Punch in!”

“I’m really looking forward to the mysterious guest of ‘Country’.”

“”The program team sure knows how to create gimmicks. They even put up a trailer to whet people’s Appetite. I’ve looked up a lot of information on the Internet, but I still haven’t found out who this mysterious guest is.” ”

“”I’m going to add one more. Let’s not talk about anything else, the secrecy of ‘Country’is really good!” ”

“Because the early part of the trailer had piqued everyone’s Appetite, the program team arranged for a wave of hot searches later on, so the popularity of ‘country’remained high. ”

The trailer had more than two billion hits on the Internet.

“The camera zoomed back and saw Lu Qi, song Yiwan, and Wei Xingzhi sitting in the small courtyard chatting. ”

“Not long after, Chang Yu, Wang Xuancheng, and Yin Wei arrived. ”

[ Weiwei is so beautiful today! ]

“[ F * ck, Chang Yu is actually shorter than Wang Xuancheng! ] ”

[ Wang Xuancheng’s official height is 178. You can imagine how short Chang Yu is. Don’t be stupid fans. ]

“After the three of them entered, they began to discuss song Chenyu. ”

[ oh my God! I’m also a fan of ‘Peerless Beauty’of Chenyu. ]

[ I didn’t expect Yiwan to like Chenyu too. ]

[ why isn’t Chenyu Here Yet? ]

“At this moment, there was a knock on the door. ”

“[ Ahhh! I, Chenyu, AM HERE! ] ” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Lu Qi walked over to open the door, and sure enough, it was song Chenyu. ”

“When she saw that it was indeed song Chenyu, the bullet screen was even more interesting ”

[ my goddess is dressed like an immortal today! ]

“[ Ahhh, I’ve finally waited for Chenyu. Chenyu is indeed a beauty that only appears once every five thousand years. Yin Wei wasn’t ugly at first, but after Chenyu came, Yin Wei became a passerby. ] ”

[ Yin Wei is alright. She has walked the path of youth. It’s obvious that she’s different from Chenyu. Don’t trample on the one upstairs. ]

“After song Chenyu entered, he discussed the last guest with everyone. When they heard that the last guest was an internet celebrity, their expressions changed. ”

[ internet celebrity? Am I seeing things? ‘The village’actually invited an internet celebrity! ]

[ oh my God! The threshold for ‘country’is really getting lower and lower. It’s fine to just invite a third or fourth-rate celebrity. What’s the point of inviting an internet celebrity? ]

[ speechless! ]

[ the program team has been mysterious for so many days. I thought they had invited some big shot! So it’s just an internet celebrity. The reputation of ‘country’is going to collapse! ]

[ speechless! Has the program team gone crazy? They don’t even want the reputation anymore for money! ]

[ why did they invite an Internet celebrity over? Did they bring any goods? ]

“[ internet celebrities are all the same. Just wait, there will be a good show to watch in a while. ] ”

[ the person above is right! Most internet celebrities can’t do without filters and thin faces. Their looks can’t be compared to celebrities. ]

[ I’m a little looking forward to which Internet celebrity it is. ]

“[ this time, not only is the program team going to be overturned, that Internet celebrity is also going to be overturned. I suddenly admire her courage. She actually dared to participate in such a high-value program. Isn’t she afraid of being ridiculed to death? ] ”

“Looking at the bullet comments on the screen, Cen Yuyan curled her lips slightly. ”

“It hadn’t even started yet, and Ye Zhuo was already being ridiculed like this. ”

The broadcast would start soon.

Ye Zhuo would definitely be in an even worse state.
