Translator: 549690339

“These days, Ye Shu had been going out of town early and returning late. ”

“At night, she wanted to make a video call, but she was afraid that it would affect ye Zao’s rest. After all, Ye Zao was about to take the college entrance examination. This was a good plan. The mother and daughter had not seen each other for more than twenty days. ”

“Hugging ye Zao, Ye Shu frowned slightly. “Zao Zao, you’ve lost weight again! Have you not eaten properly these few days? Didn’t I tell your uncle to make a pig’s Foot Soup for you every day?” ”

“Ye Shu saw that ye Zao was too thin. When she was at home before, she would boil a bowl of Angelica pig’s Foot Soup for ye Shu every night to nourish her body. ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “I drank it! I drank it every night. How have I lost weight? You must be hallucinating!” ”

Ye Shu looked left and right at Ye Zao. She looked up and down and still felt that ye Zao had lost weight.

She decided to go back early tonight and make more delicious food.

...

Time passed quickly.

In the blink of an eye.

June had arrived.

The college entrance examination was eight days away.

Ye Zao did not feel anything. It was just that the students around him were getting more and more nervous.

Especially an Lizi and Zhao Pingting.

“In order to get good marks for the college entrance examination, the two of them would go back every night and brush through the questions until midnight. In the past few days, they had even started to have dark circles around their eyes. ”

“After school at noon, ye Zao asked Zhao Pingting to have lunch together. Zhao Pingting waved her hand and said, “Zao, you can go and eat. I still have an apple in my cupboard. If you’re hungry, I’ll just eat an Apple.” ”

“Ye Zao frowned slightly. “Pingting, you haven’t gone to the canteen to eat for more than half a month.” ”

Zhao Pingting was stunned. She put down her pen and looked up at Ye Zao. “Has it been so long?”

“I’m hungry. Let’s go and have a meal together. Lizi is still waiting for us outside!” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Zhao pingting said, “I’m really not hungry. Zao, you guys go and eat. My grades are worse than yours and Lizi’s. If I can’t go to the capital with you guys this time, Will I forgive myself?”She could only work hard, would there be no regrets. ”

“Seeing this, Ye Zhuo shook his head helplessly and could only let Zhao Pingting go. ”

“After ye Zhuo left, Zhao Pingting continued to brush the questions. ”

“Seeing ye Zhuo walk out alone, an Lizi said in surprise, “Pingting isn’t eating today again?” ”

Ye Zhuo nodded.

“An Lizi said in admiration, “She’s really working hard!” ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “She wants to get into the capital Normal University. She scored 523 points in the mock exam last week and is still more than 80 points away from the Capital Normal University’s mark, so she wants to give it a shot.” ”

An Lizi nodded. “I see. It looks like I’ll have to work harder. The three of us will try our best to get into the schools that we like.”

“It’ll definitely work.”Ye Zhuo was full of confidence in his future.

“Knowing that ye Zhuo was about to take the college entrance exam, Old Mrs. Cen specially asked for a safety talisman from the temple to send it to Ye Zhuo. ”

“After Zhou Xiang found out about this, she said, “Mom, I’ll go with You Too! I’ve never been to Searing Hot’s school before!” ”

Old Mrs. Cen nodded. “Then let’s go together.”

“When Old Mrs. Cen and Zhou Xiang arrived, the school had just ended. ”

“Seeing so many youthful students walking out of the school gate, Old Mrs. Cen and Zhou Xiang both recalled their own student days. ”

“In the blink of an eye, so many years had passed. ”

“As they watched, old Mrs. Cen’s eyes suddenly lit up. “Xiang Xiang, look! That’s Yezi!” ”

“Ye Zao was beautiful. Even though she was wearing the same school uniform as everyone else, Old Mrs. Cen still recognized her at a glance. ”

“It’s Yezi!”Zhou Xiang nodded.

“Old Mrs. Cen said proudly, “Yezi is indeed worthy of being the granddaughter-in-law that I personally chose. This image, this temperament, it’s simply an existence that stands out from the crowd! TSK TSK TSK! This is simply too much!” ”

This was really too good for that sand sculpture of her eldest grandson.

Zhou Xiang waved at ye Zao. “Zaozao! This way!”

Mu Yourong had just left the school gate when she saw Granny Cen and Zhou Xiang waving at her.

Mu Yourong frowned slightly.

Are these two people annoying?

Didn’t they already make it clear to them back then?

The marriage had already been annulled!

Yet they still came over to look for her.

A toad wants to eat swan meat!

They were simply Shameless!

“”I say, are you done? ! The marriage has already been annulled! What else do you want to do? Is this interesting?”Mu Yourong directly walked in front of old Madam Cen and Zhou Xiang, her face full of impatience. ”

“Zhou Xiang was stunned for a moment. “You’re mistaken, we’re not here to look for you!” ”

“Old Madam Cen directly pushed Zhou Xiang away, her hands on her hips as she looked at Mu Yourong and directly cursed, “Are you sick! ! Who’s looking for you! ! Why Don’t you take a piss and see what kind of bird shit you look like! ! You can’t even compare to a single strand of my future granddaughter-in-law’s hair! You Don’t even have the right to bring her foot washing water! My granddaughter-in-law is a thousand times more outstanding than you! Ten Thousand Times!” ”

“Ever since she was reborn, when had Mu Yourong ever been scolded like this by someone pointing at her nose? ”

Mu Yourong was so angry that her entire body was trembling!

“Damn Old Woman! Say That Again!”

“Old Lady Cen said very arrogantly, “What’s wrong with saying it again! You are sick! Not only are you sick, but you are also narcissistic! You clearly look like a pig, yet you still think you are a Celestial Immortal! What a joke!” ”

“Seeing that Mu Yourong’s face was getting paler and paler, old lady cen added fuel to the fire, “If you have the ability, hit me! If you dare to touch me, I will dare to blame you! When the time comes, I will not be able to compensate you to death!” ”

Mu Yourong held back the anger in her heart.

“This was the school gate, and people were coming and going. If people were to find out that she had hit the old man, then she would not be able to clear her name even if she jumped into the Yellow River. ”

“”Grandma Cen! Aunt Xiang!”At this moment, ye Zao jogged out from inside. ”

“Mu Yourong looked at Ye Zao, then at Old Madam Cen and Zhou Xiang, and her eyes flashed with ridicule. It was really like birds of a feather flock together! A lowly person was only worthy of being together with a lowly person! ”

She did not need to waste time with such a person.

Mu Yourong turned and left.

Old Lady Cen spat at Mu Yourong’s back. “Bah! Scum!”
