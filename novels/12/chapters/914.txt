“Seeing Cen Yuyan like this, Song Chenyu’s lips curled up imperceptibly.”

“”Yuyan, think carefully. If the two of us fall out, who will be the most direct beneficiary?””

Cen Yuyan’s eyes darkened.

“With the situation developing like this, she did not know who to believe.”

“At this moment, her phone suddenly rang.”

Cen Yuyan picked up the call. It was from Zhou Rui. “I’m at the hospital.”

“When he heard that Cen Yuyan was at the hospital, Zhou Rui pretended to be very nervous and said, “At the hospital? Yuyan, are you injured? Which Hospital are you at? I’ll be there right away!””

“Cen Yuyan immediately explained, “I’m not injured. My Friend is injured. I’m at the People’s Hospital.””

“”Alright, I’ll be there right away.””

“Less than half an hour after hanging up, Zhou Rui rushed over. “Yuyan, are you alright?””

“I’m fine.”Cen Yuyan shook her head.

“Song Chenyu lay on the bed and continued, “Yuyan, is this your boyfriend?””

“Cen Yuyan nodded. “Zhou Rui, this is song Chenyu.””

Zhou Rui pretended not to know song Chenyu. “Miss Song.”

“”Mr. Zhou.”Song Chenyu continued, “I’ve heard about you from Yuyan a long time ago. I’ve finally seen you in person today.””

Zhou Rui’s clothes suddenly came to a realization. “Oh! I know! You’re Chenyu’s best friend!”

“Hearing this, song Chenyu lowered his head dejectedly. “I was before, but not anymore.””

“Zhou Rui was stunned. He raised his head to look at Cen Yuyan, his eyes filled with confusion.”

“Cen Yuyan continued, “I’ve called a nurse for you. The Nurse Union will come over to take care of you later. Zhou Rui and I will go back first.””

Song Chenyu nodded.

“After getting into the car, Zhou Rui asked curiously, “Yuyan, what’s up with that Miss Song?””

Cen Yuyan told Zhou Rui what had happened.

“Upon hearing this, Zhou Rui said in jealousy, “Yuyan, have you liked other men in the past? Isn’t That Lu Xiu very handsome? Do you still like him now?””

Cen Yuyan shook her head. “I don’t like him. That’s already in the past. The person I like the most now is you.”

“In the end, she even kissed Zhou Rui on the cheek.”

“Only then was Zhou Rui satisfied, she continued, “You’ve known Miss Song for so many years, and miss song risked her life to save you today. You should believe her!”! Movie stars like them valued their faces the most. Think about it. If miss song hurts her face, wouldn’t her life be ruined?””

Cen Yuyan was stunned.

“Zhou rui continued, “This means that miss song values you more than herself. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have risked her life to save you! “So, Yuyan, I think you should cherish miss song! “You can’t find a second friend like miss song in all of China. It’s your loss to lose such a friend!””

“Cen Yuyan was still unable to forgive song Chenyu, but after hearing Zhou Rui’s words, she seemed to have a sudden epiphany.”

Zhou Rui’s words were very reasonable.

“Zhou Rui! Turn around!”Cen Yuyan suddenly said.

“What’s Wrong?”Zhou Rui asked.

“Cen Yuyan continued, “I want to go to the hospital.””

“Have you thought it through?”Zhou Rui asked.

Cen Yuyan nodded.

“Soon, the two of them arrived at the hospital again.”

“When song Chenyu saw Cen Yuyan return, he was a little surprised. “Yuyan, why are you both back?””

“Cen Yuyan ran over and hugged song Chenyu. “Chenyu, I’m sorry. It’s all my fault...”if she had not listened to song Chenyu’s explanation, Song Chenyu would not have gotten hurt because of this.”

All of this was her fault.

“The more Cen Yuyan thought about it, the more uncomfortable she felt. The more she thought about it, the more she blamed herself.”

“”Yuyan, I should be the one apologizing to you. I’m the one who let you down...”as she spoke, Song Chenyu raised his head to look at Zhou Rui. The two of them looked at each other and saw a sense of pride in each other’s eyes.”

This CEN Yuyan was really not an ordinary fool.

On the other side.

Half a month later.

Aunt Lang was sitting in front of a stone table in the courtyard. She held a string of pure white Lily of the valley orchids in her hand. Scenes of the past appeared in front of her eyes.

“Looking at these pure white Lily of the valley orchids, it was as if a child was still by her side.”

“”Aunt Lang.”At this moment, Xiao Mei walked in from outside the courtyard.”

It was as if Aunt Lang did not hear Xiao Mei’s words.

Xiao Mei called Aunt Lang again.

“Only then did Aunt Lang hear Xiao Mei’s voice. She raised her head and asked, “What’s Wrong?””

“Xiao Mei continued, “Aunt Lang, Mr. Cao is here.””

“He’s not here.”

“Xiao Mei said again, “He said that he has something very important to tell you.””

“Let him go back.”Aunt Lang massaged her temples tiredly.

“At this moment, an unfamiliar male voice suddenly sounded in the air.”

“”If I say that I have news here for half a month, are you still unwilling to see me?””
