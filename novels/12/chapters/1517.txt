“”OH.”Lin Ze nodded. “Sister Lizi, I’ll be sitting there. If you need anything, you can call me. I’ll go over first.” ”

“”Lizi, I’m Back!”Zhang Qingqing returned to her seat at this time. When she looked up, she saw a handsome face without any flaws. The black hoodie made her already fair skin look even whiter, she had a pair of standard Phoenix eyes and did not smile. She looked a little cold and melancholic. ”

She looked like a three-dimensional youth who had walked out of a manga.

He was even more handsome than their school’s best student!

“Stars were about to appear in Zhang Qingqing’s eyes, but she tried her best to suppress her excitement. “Lizi, who is this handsome man? Aren’t you going to introduce him?” ”

“An Lizi said, “This is my cousin, Lin Ze. Ah Ze, this is my friend, Zhang Qingqing.” ” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Lin Ze nodded at Zhang Qingqing. “Hello.”

“After saying that, Lin Ze turned to look at an Lizi. “Sister Lizi, I’ll be going now.” ”

“Okay.”

Zhang Qingqing silently retracted her hand that was about to shake Lin Ze’s hand.

“After Lin Ze left, Zhang Qingqing looked at an lizi and asked, “Lizi, is he a relative of your stepfather’s side?” ”

“Yes.”An Lizi nodded.

“”He’s so handsome!”Zhang Qingqing continued, “Do you have a girlfriend?” ”

An Lizi knew what Zhang Qingqing meant.

“However, she felt that Zhang Qingqing and Lin Ze were not compatible. Moreover, Lin Ze did not have any intention of finding a girlfriend. What if Lin Ze got angry if he rashly set them up? ”

“”I’m not sure either, but Ah Ze is so good-looking. He must have a girlfriend!”An Lizi said. ”

“”You’re his cousin, and you don’t even know?”Zhang Qingqing asked. ”

An Lizi shook her head. “We rarely talk about these things.”

“Zhang Qingqing rolled her eyes, then, she said, “Then help me ask around. If he doesn’t have a girlfriend, help me set him up! If he and I are successful, won’t we be relatives then? What do you have to call me? Sister-in-law?”Zhang Qing Qing had already fallen into a beautiful fantasy. ”

“She and an Lizi were good friends to begin with. If she and Lin Ze succeed, then she and an Lizi would be even closer! ”

“An Lizi nodded. “Alright, I’ll find an opportunity to help you ask.” ”

“Don’t look for an opportunity. Let’s do it now!”Zhang Qing Qing couldn’t wait any longer.

“In this society, it was rare to see a handsome boy with a rich family, especially one as handsome as Lin Ze! ”

“An Lizi said with some difficulty, “Isn’t it a little inappropriate now? He’s with his friends!” ”

“The Friends of the rich second generation were definitely the rich second generation. Thinking of this, Zhang Qingqing’s eyes lit up. She didn’t expect to have such a good opportunity today! ”

“Then take me to get to know his friends!”Zhang Qingqing stood up and said.

“This... isn’t Good?”An Lizi said.

“”What’s not good about it?”Zhang Qingqing directly pulled an lizi up. “What era is it now, and you’re still so conservative? It’s not a big deal to get to know him. As the saying goes, more friends lead to more paths!” ”

“Helpless, an Lizi had no choice but to stand up and walk over with Zhang Qingqing. ”

“Not long after, the two of them walked to the table. ”

“Zhang Qingqing counted. There were four boys in total, including Lin Ze. Although the other three were quite handsome, they were still a little lacking compared to Lin Ze! ”

“If Lin Ze was not by their side, then they would also be the kind of handsome guys that were hard to come by! ”

“Ah Ze!”An Lizi continued to speak.

Lin Ze looked up. “Sister Lizi!”

“The other three people at the table looked at Lin ze curiously. Li Wen asked, “Brother Ze, are these two your cousins?” ”

“Zhang Qingqing quickly followed up, “No, no, I’m Lin Ze’s cousin’s good friend, Zhang Qingqing. Gong Zhangzhang, Qingtian’s Qing! Nice to meet you!” ”

“Hello!”Li Wen nodded. “I’m Li Wen.”

“Lin Ze then introduced, “This is my cousin, an Lizi. Lizi, these three are my good friends. This is Mozzie, this is fat tiger, and this is Buttface!” ”

“The three of them stood up and greeted an Lizi. “Hello, cousin, I’m Mozzie!” ”

“Fat Tiger!”

“Buttface!”

Zhang Qingqing frowned slightly. What kind of names were these?

Nickname?

It was really ugly to hear.

Was a wealthy family so down-to-earth?

“After introducing each other, Zhang Qingqing continued, “Let’s add each other on wechat! We’ll come out to play together another day!” ”
