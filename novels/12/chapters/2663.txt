“”Zhuozhuo, where’s your sister-in-law?”Asked Old Mrs. Cen. ”

“”She’s inside. Grandma Cen, Aunt Xiang, come in quickly,”said ye Zhuo. ”

“”Okay.”Old Mrs. Cen nodded. She looked at ye Zhuo and said, “Zhuozhuo, your sister-in-law gave birth to a boy, right?” ” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“”Yes.”Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Didn’t Cen Shaoqing tell you?” ”

“”What does that Brat know!”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “He only said that your sister-in-law gave birth and didn’t say anything about it!” ”

“After saying that, old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “I knew it must be a boy! Your Lin family has this root! Xiangxiang, do you think what I said is right?” ”

“”Yes, yes,”Zhou Xiang said, “It’s strange. What kind of genes do you think your family has? You only give birth to boys, not girls.” ”

“Although there was a girl in ye Zao’s generation, Ye Zao and Lin Ze were twins. ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Then, am I not a Girl?” ”

“Zhou Xiang said, “You and Ah Ze are twins. What I mean is that no one in your family can have a daughter after giving birth.” ”

“”That’s true.”Ye Zao continued, “My third aunt has given birth to three children without a daughter.” ”

“At first, third aunt did not believe in this. She even said that she would not give up until she gave birth to a girl. After giving birth to three children in a row, she gradually gave up. ”

“How many Catties was your brother’s child born?”Old Mrs. Cen asked.

“Ye Zhuo said, “Eight catties and three taels.” ”

“”Yo, it’s not light!”Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “It’s not like Shaoqing. He was only a little more than five catties when he was born, just like a puppy.” ”

“Ye Zao laughed softly, which reminded her of something. ”

“One day, Ye Zao sent a message to CEN Shaoqing, which roughly meant where you are, dog. ”

“After Cen Shaoqing saw it, he replied seriously, “I’m not a dog, I’m a human.”. ”

“Then, ye Zao replied again, “You’re trying to blind my dog eyes.”. ”

“Cen Shaoqing replied again, “You’re not a dog either, you’re also a human.”. ”

“Then, he replied, “Be good, don’t talk about yourself like that in the future. We are not dogs.”. ”

“Ye Zao laughed for a long time on the other end of the screen. Until now, when he thought about it, he still felt that Cen Shaoqing was too funny. ”

“Now, ye Zao finally understood that this person had been a dog since the day he was born. ”

The three of them talked as they walked into the ward.

“After passing through the living room, they arrived at the bedroom inside. ”

“Ye Shu and Lin Jincheng came out to welcome them. Ye Shu smiled and said, “Old Madam, Xiangxiang, why are you guys here in person!” ”

“”We’re here to see the baby,”Old Madam Cen said. ”

“Zhou Xiang handed the thermos bucket in her hand to Ye Shu. “Ah Shu, I made some chicken soup for Jingshu. I didn’t put much salt in it. Take it and nourish Jingshu.” ”

“You’ve put in a lot of effort.”Ye Shu took the thermos bucket.

“Zhou xiang smiled and said, “It’s a small matter. Oh right, you haven’t eaten yet, right? I’ve also prepared food for you. The housekeeper will send it over right away.” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen walked in front of Bai Jingshu and smiled. “TSK, look at how cute this baby is! He looks like Jingshu, but also a little like Ah Ze!” ”

This child was good in every way except for one thing.

It would be even better if it was ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing’s child!

Old Mrs. Cen looked at Bai Jingshu. “Have you given the baby a Name Yet?”

“”Yes,”Bai Jingshu said with a smile. “His nickname is tie Zhu, and his real name is Lin Xi.” ”

“Upon hearing this name, Old Mrs. Cen was immediately amused. “His real name sounds pretty good, but his nickname is a little too down-to-earth. However, it’s good to be down-to-earth, and it’s easy to feed him! In the past, didn’t people always call him a rat or a B * Stard?” ”

“Bai Jingshu said, “The big name was given by aunt, and the nickname was given by his father. Fortunately, we have an aunt at home, or else we would have called ourselves ‘Iron Pillar’.” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “Actually, ‘iron pillar’is pretty good too. Of course, the name ‘burning’sounds even better!”As expected of her good granddaughter-in-law! ”

“”Come Jingshu, this is the chicken soup that your aunt Xiang specially brewed for you. have some.”Ye Shusheng scooped up a bowl of chicken soup and handed it to Bai Jingshu. ”

“Bai Jingshu smiled and took the chicken soup. “Thank you, Aunt Xiang.” ”

“Zhou Xiang said, “What are you being so polite for? We’re all on the same side!” ”

“”I almost forgot! And This!”At this moment.., old Mrs. Cen seemed to have thought of something. She took out a small golden lock from her bosom and put it around the baby’s neck. “This is the longevity lock that great-grandmother gave us. I wish our little iron pillar a long life, peace, and happiness.” ”

“”Quickly thank great-grandmother.”Ye Shu walked over. “Old Lady, you are too polite. How can an elder like you prepare a gift for a baby!” ”
