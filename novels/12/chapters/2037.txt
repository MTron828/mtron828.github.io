“Take him away!”Autumn flute said coldly.

“Ye Han said, “Yes!” ”

“”Wait a moment,”Zhao Dan who was standing there said softly. ”

Ye Han continued to walk forward.

“Wait a moment!”Zhao Dan frowned slightly and spoke again.

Ye Han turned a deaf ear.

“”Wu Han, didn’t you hear what Madam Said?”Autumn flute followed up. ”

“Only then did ye Han pause. “Eldest miss, do you have any other orders?” ”

“Zhao Dan narrowed her eyes. Could it be that with her status and status, she couldn’t move one of Qiu Di’s followers? ”

“Qiu Di turned to look at Zhao Dan, “I’m really sorry, Madam. Wu Han used to be a follower of Miss Ye, so he’s quite stubborn. When Miss Ye was around, he only listened to miss ye. Now that Miss Ye has left, he only listens to me.” ”

“Hearing this, the anger in Zhao Dan’s eyes disappeared a little. “So that’s how it is.” ”

“After saying that, Zhao Dan seemed to have thought of something and continued, “But I remember. was his surname Ye before?” ”

“Qiu Di nodded. “You really have a good memory. But it’s a long story. I’ll explain it to you when I have time in the future. Oh right, why did you ask him to stop?” ”

Zhao Dan turned the ring on his finger and pointed at Ye Lan. “Let her continue.”

Continue?

“Qiu di continued, “Madam, she’s just a poor person with a mental disorder. You Don’t have to listen to her nonsense.” ”

“”I’m talking nonsense!”! Qiu Di! Who is talking nonsense! Ye Lan said angrily, “Qiu Di, you were the one who set me up from the beginning to the end. You were the one who told me that I was the Manxing Kingdom’s princess... ... “If you hadn’t set me up and Lied to me, would I have thought that I was a Princess?” ”

“Now that she thought about it, ye Lan felt that she was too stupid. ”

Why did she believe Qiu Di’s nonsense?

Why did she believe Qiu Di!

“Qiu Di interrupted ye Lan’s unfinished words, “Shut up! Would I say such nonsense to you? “Ye Lan, I know that ever since Miss Ye’s accident, your mental state hasn’t been very good. I didn’t want to argue with you, but you’re getting more and more ridiculous! “Princess of the Manxing Kingdom, you really know how to Dream!” ”

“After saying this, Qiu di looked at Zhao Dan again, then he said, “Madam, her name is Ye Lan. She is Miss Ye’s foster sister and also the former chief of the Ye family base. Ever since Miss Ye’s accident, she has become like this. I implore you to spare her this once on account of Miss Ye’s face.” ”

“”Pretending! You’re still pretending! Autumn flute, don’t you think you’re disgusting?”Ye Lan pointed at autumn flute and said, “Autumn flute, the Heavenly Dao has a cycle of reincarnation and retribution isn’t pleasant, you...” ”

“Autumn flute directly interrupted ye Lan’s unfinished words and said to ye Han, “Ye Han, hurry up and get her out! If you disturb Madam’s esteemed presence, who will be responsible!” ”

Ye Lan was just about to say something when ye Han used a piece of cloth to cover her mouth and walked out of the door.

“Looking at Ye Lan’s back, Zhao Dan frowned slightly and looked at Qiu Di. “That girl is Miss Ye’s foster sister?” ”

“”Yes, her name is Ye Lan. She is Miss Ye’s younger sister who was raised by Miss Ye.”Qiu Di nodded, then, he said, “Her background is complicated. Because she had a abusive and alcoholic father, her mother brought her out when she was three years old. Unexpectedly, her mother died tragically in front of her on the way. From then on, she became a homeless orphan. “Also, because she didn’t have a perfect family since she was young, ye Lan longed to have parents who loved her from a young age. She wanted to be born noble... “... “...” ”

“At this point, Qiu di paused. “I just didn’t expect that she actually imagined herself as a full moon princess. It seems that ye Lan’s condition is getting worse!” ”

Qiu Di sighed deeply. No one could tell that Qiu Di was acting.

“After listening to the whole process, Zhao Dan also sighed. She was also a mother who had lost her child, so she knew what it was like to have a child separated from her. ”

“Although she had another son and daughter after her eldest daughter went missing, she could not make up for the emptiness in her heart. ”

“The eldest daughter was the eldest daughter. No matter how many children she raised later, she could not replace the position of the eldest daughter. ” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“What about her father?”Zhao Dan asked.

“Qiu di continued, “That father of his doesn’t deserve to be a father at all. Not only did he abuse alcohol and domestic violence, but he also sold ye Lan’s only elder sister into the Little Red Mansion. It was also because of this reason that miss ye directly cut off all contact between Ye Lan and her father. Think about it, if ye Lan is pestered by such a father, how will she live in the future?” ”
