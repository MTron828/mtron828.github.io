Translator: 549690339

It was better to explain the situation to Xia Xiaoman first.

“In fact, Xia Xiaoman was already mentally prepared. She knew that Old Lady Lin would not like her too much.”

“Because during their relationship, Lin Qingxuan had already confessed everything to her.”

Including the matter of first love and Zhao Shining.

“Now, the Lin family’s several sisters-in-law had not hidden anything from her and were on the same side as her. This made Xia Xiaoman very surprised. She also felt that the Lin family was a good family.”

“Of course, except for Old Lady Lin.”

“Ever since Old Lady Lin went to look for Lin Qingxuan, she had not come out of the house.”

Everyone in the Lin family knew what Old Lady Lin meant.

“She simply wanted to embarrass Lin Qingxuan and Xia Xiaoman. She was the old lady of the Lin family. As long as she did not approve of Xia Xiaoman, Xia Xiaoman would not be able to stand in the Lin family.”

“Unfortunately, Old Lady Lin miscalculated. If she did not receive Xia Xiaoman, there would naturally be others to receive her.”

“Seeing that Old Lady Lin did not stand out, ye Shu stood up and said, “Xiaoman has been here for so long, but she hasn’t gone to the east courtyard yet! “Sister-in-law, second sister-in-law, and third sister-in-law, let’s Take Xiaoman to the east courtyard now. I’ve already arranged for the kitchen to prepare. We’ll have lunch at the east courtyard at noon.””

“Wu Mei nodded. “Alright, fifth sister-in-law, you’re the most thoughtful one.””

Old Madam Lin had been sitting in her room sulking.

She had originally thought that Lin Qingxuan would come over and beg her to go out and take charge of the situation.

“However, after waiting for so long, Lin Qingxuan still did not appear. This time, Old Madam Lin was a little anxious. Why had Lin Qingxuan not come?”

“If Lin Qingxuan had come to invite her, she would definitely take this opportunity to educate Lin Qingxuan.”

Unfortunately.

Old Lady Lin had not been able to wait for Lin Qingxuan.

“Logically speaking, it was time to eat. Why hadn’t Lin Qingxuan come?”

“In the end, Old Lady Lin could not sit still and went to the main hall.”

The originally lively main hall was now empty. There was not a single person in sight.

“Could it be that Xia Xiaoman was self-aware and knew that she did not like her, so she ran away with her tail between her legs?”

Old Mrs. Lin called the maid over and asked what was going on. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Hearing the maid’s answer, Old Mrs. Lin’s face turned pale.”

Ye Shu!

Ye Shu again!

Ye Shu was too bold. She actually dared to take her to the east courtyard without her consent.

Did she still put her mother-in-law in her eyes? !

And those three daughters-in-law were also insensible.

How could they let ye Shu do whatever she wanted? !

Old Lady Lin was still a little guilty about ye Shu.

“At this moment, she didn’t feel any guilt at all.”

Ye Shu was really too much!

Old Lady Lin was so angry that her whole body hurt everywhere.

...

The eastern courtyard was very happy.

“Because there were many people in the Ye family, Ye Shu opened three tables in the restaurant.”

The same generation and the same generation sat at the same table.

“Xia Xiaoman, Lin Qingxuan, and a few of the Lin family’s elder brothers and sisters-in-law sat at the same table.”

An Lizi sat at the same table as ye Zhuo and the Lin family’s cousins.

The others sat at the other table.

“Lin Qingxuan was very grateful to Ye Shu. He raised his cup and toasted ye Shu. “Fifth brother and sister, everything goes without saying! Let Me Toast First!””

Ye Shu immediately stood up with the glass in her hand and drank the wine in the glass in one gulp.

Lin Qingxuan gave another toast to the other sisters-in-law.

“If it wasn’t for the support of the sisters-in-law today, he would really be embarrassed in front of Xia Xiaoman.”

It wasn’t until the afternoon that Lin Qingxuan sent Xia Xiaoman and an Lizi back.

“Lin Qingxuan sent the mother and daughter home, and Xia Xiaoman sent him out of the apartment building in the community.”

“An Lizi was in the car just now, so Lin Qingxuan couldn’t say anything in front of the child.”

“Lin Qingxuan held Xia Xiaoman’s hand. “Xiaoman, how do you feel about going to my house today?””

“Xia Xiaoman went straight to the point, “Your family is very good, and I get along very well with my sisters-in-law. But on your mother’s side, she probably won’t like me too much, right? If your mother doesn’t accept me, what do you plan to do?””

Xia Xiaoman only wanted Lin Qingxuan’s attitude now.

“Lin Qingxuan looked at Xia Xiaoman and said very seriously, “Xiaoman, don’t worry. I’ll definitely think of a way to convince my mother to accept you.”He liked Xia Xiaoman very much, very much.”

“So, he would definitely convince Old Lady Lin.”

“Xia Xiaoman looked at Lin Qingxuan and continued, “Qingxuan, we’re already over forty years old. We don’t have much time to waste between us.””

Young people could get used to dating for a few more years.

But they were already forty years old.
