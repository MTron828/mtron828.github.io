“During this one year, song Shiyu tried many ways to forget her. ”

But none of them worked.

“In this world, there were only two things that could not be hidden. ”

Cough and love.

“Since he could not forget her, he would love her forever. ”

“Then, he would turn this love into protection. ”

“”Brother Song, you haven’t Met Your Lover Yet?”Ye Zhuo looked at song Shiyu. ”

“Song Shiyu nodded. “Love is something that can only be found by chance, not by request. Let nature take its course.” ”

It was not that he had not met his lover.

It was that his lover was not his lover.

“Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “You’re right. You Can’t force it. At most, you can just live alone for the rest of your life.” ”

Ye Zhuo’s love philosophy was that he would rather live alone for the rest of his life than make do with it.

“In fact, being financially independent and without the love of his life, it was quite good to be single for his whole life. ”

Life was a process of gain and loss.

“A single noble could not enjoy the happiness of family. Similarly, people with many children and grandchildren would never be able to experience the happiness of being single. ”

Song Shiyu smiled and raised the camera in his hand. “Let me take a picture of you? I’ve practiced.”

Practiced?

Ye Zhuo raised his head to look at Song Shiyu. “You’ve studied photography before?”

“Yes.”Song Shiyu nodded slightly.

“”Alright then, I’ll leave it to master song,”Ye Zhuo said with a smile. ”

“Song Shiyu’s light blue dress fluttered in the wind. His photography skills were very good, and the photos he took were almost 365 degrees with no blind spots. ”

“Is it done?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“Yes.”Song Shiyu nodded slightly and ran to ye Zhuo’s side. “I’ll send the photos to you after I develop them.”

“”There’s no need to develop them. You can just send them to my wechat directly,”ye Zhuo said. ”

“”Okay,”song Shiyu said. ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Brother song, have you eaten? If you haven’t eaten, there’s a food street over there that we can try.” ”

“Although ye Zhuo had already eaten, she could still eat some of the food in the Food Street. ”

“Song Shiyu helped her take photos, so she should treat him to some food. ” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Hearing this, song Shiyu nodded. “Okay, let’s go together. It just so happens that I need to find a place to eat.” ”

“Then let’s go.”Ye Zhuo stepped forward.

The two of them walked in the direction of the Food Street one after the other.

“Compared to the seaside, the food street was a little crowded. It was crowded and noisy. ”

“Song Shiyu walked to a stinky tofu stall. “I like to eat stinky tofu. Ye Zhuo, can you give me two pieces?” ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “I like it too.” ”

Song Shiyu looked at the boss. “Two pieces.”

“”Okay, please wait a moment.”The boss fried two pieces of tofu and asked, “Can you two eat spicy food?” ”

Song Shiyu nodded. “I’m fine with it. What About You?”

The last sentence was directed at Ye Zhuo.

“Ye Zhuo said, “I’m fine with it too.”. ”

“Song Shiyu said, “Then have some more chili.” ”

“Very soon, the boss handed two servings of stinky tofu to song Shiyu. ”

Song Shiyu took the stinky tofu and handed one to ye Zhuo.

“Ye Zhuo tasted one piece. It was stinky and smelly when it entered his mouth. After he gently bit it open, the juice was overflowing. ”

“The taste is very good. You should try it too.”Ye Zhuo turned to look at song Shiyu.

Song Shiyu also tasted a piece. “It’s really good.”

This was probably the best smelly tofu he had ever eaten.

“Then, the two of them went to the stall that sold cold noodles and ordered two servings of cold noodles. ”

“Time passed very quickly. In the blink of an eye, it was nine o’clock. ”

“Ye Zhuo looked at the time and then said, “Brother song, I’ll go back first.” ”

“I’ll send you back.”Song Shiyu stood up.

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “No need. I live near the seaside.” ”

“Song Shiyu asked, “Is it Chaohai Residence?” ”

“”Yes.”Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “You live there too?” ”

“Song Shiyu said, “I live in Building 02.” ”

“”What a coincidence. I live in Building 01,”ye Zhuo said. ”

Song Shiyu stepped forward. “We can go back together.”

“Okay.”

“The two of them chatted as they walked. Soon, they reached Chaohai residence. ”

“At the fork in the road, Song Shiyu stopped. “Then I won’t send you off.” ”

“”Okay, no need. It’s just a few steps away,”ye Zao continued, “Come over for tea when you have time.” ”

“Okay.”

Song Shiyu saw ye Zao to the corner and turned back. He watched ye Zao’s back with an indescribable expression in his eyes.

It was a little sad.

He didn’t turn back until he saw ye Zhuo’s figure disappear into the night.

“The assistant had been waiting in the room for a long time. When he saw song Shiyu return, he immediately stood up. “Boss, you’re back.” ”

“”Okay.”Under the Crystal Light, song Shiyu’s face was a little pale. “Go and call doctor Liu over.” ”
