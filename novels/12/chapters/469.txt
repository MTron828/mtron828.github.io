Chapter 470: 125: it’s too late to regret. She’s the new campus belle. Brother Ze looks a little like her! 7

Translator: 549690339

Lin Jincheng narrowed his eyes.

He still felt that something was wrong.

Something was very wrong.

“At this moment, there was a knock on the door. “Director Lin, Miss Feng is here.” ”

Miss Feng was naturally referring to Feng Qianhua.

“”Let her in,”Lin Jincheng said. ”

“Outside the door, Feng Qianhua’s eyes lit up. ”

She had finally arrived.

“After so many years, she had finally arrived. ”

“In the past, Lin Jincheng had only rejected her and never allowed her to step into the ward. ”

This was the first time.

Feng Qianhua’s lips curled into a smile as she walked in. “Brother Jincheng.”

Lin Jincheng raised his head to look at Feng Qianhua.

Feng Qianhua was no different from what he remembered.

“They had known each other since they were young, but when they were young, Lin Jincheng only thought of Feng Qianhua as his younger sister. ”

“Later, as the two grew up, the parents of the two families began to set the two of them up on purpose. They even wanted to set up an engagement. ”

But Lin Jincheng refused.

He didn’t like Feng Qianhua.

He didn’t have any feelings for Feng Qianhua.

It was clearly the person he didn’t like. What exactly happened nineteen years ago?

What was the reason that caused him to fall madly in love with Feng Qianhua?

He even had a child?

That wasn’t right.

This was very wrong!

Why?

Why did he remember everything except those 19 years.

Lin Jincheng felt like his brain was about to explode.

“At this moment, the pain was unbearable. ”

“He tried his best to grab some memories, but he couldn’t remember anything. ”

What did he forget?

What did he miss?

“”Brother Jin Cheng, are you okay?”Feng Qianhua put down the thermos. “I made some soup for you. Do you want some?” ”

Lin Jin Cheng didn’t say anything.

“Seeing that Lin Jin Cheng didn’t say anything, Feng Qianhua opened the thermos and scooped out a bowl of soup. She fed it to Lin Jin Cheng with a spoon. ”

Lin Jin Cheng pursed his lips and suddenly turned his head. “You go back first!”

Feng Qianhua was stunned.

What was going on?

Could it be that Lin Jincheng remembered something?

“But if Lin Jincheng really remembered something, would he be so calm? ”

Definitely Not!

“Brother Jincheng...”

“A glimmer flashed across Feng Qianhua’s lowered eyes. She knew that at this moment, she could not stay in the ward any longer. ”

There were still many opportunities in the future.

“As long as Lin Jincheng didn’t think of Ye Shu, one day, she would become the ye Shu in Lin Jincheng’s heart! ”

“Feng Qianhua stood up from the chair. “Brother Jincheng, I won’t bother you anymore...”at this point, feng Qianhua paused and said earnestly, “Let bygones be bygones. Don’t think too much and don’t give yourself any pressure.” ”

“I’ve waited for you for nineteen years. I don’t care about that one or two years anymore.”

“After saying that, Feng Qianhua turned around and left the ward. ”

Without any hesitation.

Lin Jincheng turned to Secretary Zhang. “Is it really her?”

Secretary Zhang nodded. “It’s her.”

“”Secretary Zhang, you can go out first. I want to be alone.”Lin Jincheng waved his hand. ”

Secretary Zhang turned around and went out.

“At this moment, Lin Jincheng suddenly called out to him, “Wait a moment.” ”

“”Director Lin, do you have anything else?”Secretary Zhang stopped in his tracks. ”

Lin Jincheng pointed at the Thermos flask on the table. “Take That with you.”

“Okay.”Secretary Zhang nodded and took the Thermos flask off the table.

Feng Qianhua hadn’t left yet.

She was waiting outside the door.

“Seeing Secretary Zhang come out with the Thermos flask, her eyes dimmed. She walked over and took the Thermos flask from secretary Zhang’s hand. “You didn’t drink it, Boss Lin?” ”

Secretary Zhang shook his head.

“Feng Qianhua continued, “Secretary Zhang, you’re Boss Lin’s most trusted subordinate. During this period of time, you must take good care of him.” ”

Others might not understand the meaning of this sentence.

But secretary Zhang could understand it.

This was to remind him not to spill the beans.

Feng Qianhua had been hiding by Lin Jincheng’s side for 19 years. Wasn’t this the day she had been waiting for?

“Secretary zhang said, “Don’t worry, I will definitely take good care of chief Lin.” ”

“Feng Qianhua smiled and said, “Secretary Zhang, I trust your character. Otherwise, chief Lin wouldn’t trust you so much.” ”

“”If there’s nothing else, I’ll take my leave first.” ”

Feng Qianhua nodded. “Go do your work.”

Secretary Zhang turned around and left.

Feng Qianhua looked at his back and narrowed her eyes.

It didn’t matter if Lin Jincheng didn’t drink her soup now.

“She believed that one day, Lin Jincheng would drink it. ”

After all.

“Compared to before, the current Lin Jincheng was no longer so resistant to her. ”

This was a good start.

Everything had a transition period.

As for ye Shu?

She would disappear from Lin Jincheng’s life forever.

“Thinking of this, the corners of Feng Qianhua’s mouth curled up. ”

...

Today was Sunday.

“Lin Ze, dog two, fat tiger, and Li Wen had arranged to meet up for a small gathering. ”

“After fifteen days of military training, apart from Lin Ze, the other three had all turned dark several times. ”

The place where the four of them gathered was a clean bar.

“The environment was very elegant, and soothing music was playing in the air. ”

Lin Ze picked up his glass and took a sip of wine.

“The 19-year-old youth had a sadness in his eyes that was not present at his age. His eyes were clear, and his facial features were exquisite. ”

“Because he had lived in a rich and noble family all year round, he had a dignified aura about him, which was particularly attractive. ”

“Because of this, after the military training ended, Lin Ze was listed on the school’s draft list. ”

He became one of the most influential people in Beijing University.

“Li Wen took out his phone and said excitedly, “Brother Ze, Buttface, that New Campus Belle from your school is really too beautiful! What’s her name?” ”

“Buttface said, “I think her name is Ye Zhuo, right? She’s from the chemistry department. Back then, during the military training, she was quite a sensation! Her skills are also very good. It’s said that even the instructors can’t beat her!” ” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Originally, Jing University’s internal school Belle was Feng Xianxian. ”

“Who knew that because of the military training review video, a scene of her unintentionally greeting someone caused ye Zao to go straight from the capital to the neighboring Qing Hua. She was known by everyone as the goddess of faceless beauty, the newly promoted school Belle! ”

She directly crushed Feng Xianxian.

“Fat Tiger said, “Isn’t our brother Ze also a school belle? Why Don’t brother Ze come forward and ask for a way to contact him?” ”

“Li Wen nodded and said in agreement, “Yes, yes, yes.” ”

“”I’m not interested,”Lin Ze’s tone was indifferent. ”

“Li Wen continued, “Brother Ze, you must not have seen what your campus Belle looks like, right? I have a video here, quick, take a look.” ”

“As he said that, Li Wen handed his phone over. ”

The video of Ye Zhuo wearing a camouflage uniform and looking back with a smile was made into a dynamic picture by the netizens.

“The moment he looked back, everything in the world instantly paled in comparison. ”

Lin Ze lowered his head and took a look. “That’s it.”

He had always been uninterested in the campus Belle and the campus belle.

“Li Wen didn’t quite understand Lin Ze’s judgment. “What do you mean that’s it! She’s clearly very good-looking, okay? She’s ten thousand times better looking than Feng Xianxian!” ”

“Fat Tiger looked at Lin Ze, then looked at the video again and asked curiously, “Why do I feel that this campus Belle and brother Ze look a little alike?” ”
