“Handsome!”Zhao pingting nodded.

How could her ‘First Love’Not Be Handsome?

“”Bring me to take a look after school?”Ye Zhuo continued, “And confess your love.” ”

Zhao Pingting shook her head. “Forget it...”

“”Why do you want to forget it?”Ye Zhuo said, “If you like it, then confess! You’re about to graduate. Who knows if we’ll see each other again in the future!” ”

“Zhao Pingting was a very reserved girl. When she heard this, her face blushed. “I, I don’t dare...” ”

“What’s there to be afraid of?”Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly.

“Zhao pingting continued, “Zao, if it’s someone you like, will you take the initiative to Confess?” ”

“”Yes.”Ye Zao nodded with certainty, “Life is short. No one knows what will happen in the next second. Since You Have Love in Your Heart, why don’t you dare to say it out loud? Even if he really rejected you, what can you do? You Won’t lose anything! “It’s hard to find two-legged toads, but there are plenty of two-legged men!” ”

“After saying that, Ye Zhuo patted Zhao Pingting’s shoulder. “Don’t leave regrets for your youth.” ”

“”Zhuo Zhuo, if I were you, it would be great.”Zhao Pingting looked at ye Zhuo enviously. ”

Ye Zao patted Zhao Pingting on the shoulder. “You can decide for yourself.”

Zhao pingting nodded.

“Not long after, the bell rang. ”

“The homeroom teacher, Jiang Wenhui, walked up to the podium with the lesson plan in his hands. As usual, he reviewed the key points for everyone. Just as the class was about to end, he suddenly cleared his throat. For once, he did not say anything serious. ”

“Alright! I want to say a few words. You are about to graduate soon...”

“As he spoke, his voice choked up. Looking at the familiar faces below the stage, his eyes suddenly turned slightly red. He could not say what he wanted to say next. ”

This batch of students was brought up by him from the first year of high school to the third year of high school.

He had personally witnessed the transformation and growth of the children.

In the three years of ups and downs.

There were tears and laughter.

There were sadness and joy.

“They had once received the common honor, and they had also received the doubts from the outside world. ”

“Those past events were like a movie playing out in front of his eyes. Jiang Wenhui could not control his emotions. He turned around, took off his glasses, and pinched the bridge of his nose, “Alright, I won’t say anymore. I wish everyone a smooth exam!” ”

“After saying that, he walked out of the classroom in a hurry. ”

The students below the stage weren’t in a good state either. Their eyes were all red.

Even the most mischievous and mischievous students were now snot and tears.

“After Jiang Wenhui left Class 7’s classroom, he couldn’t help but squat on the ground and SOB softly. ”

“After a long while, his emotions gradually stabilized. He stood up and walked towards the office. ”

“Just as he walked into the office, he heard Qian Dabao’s voice, “Teacher Jiang, tomorrow will be the exam venue. I wish your class’s Ye Zao the best on the Honor Roll!” ”

“Ever since ye Zao entered the honor roll last time, Qian Dabao had always felt that ye Zao had plagiarized. ”

The college entrance examination was about to begin.

Ye Zao was about to reveal his true form. Qian Dabao was naturally happy!

The first place went to their class.

“The top scorer in the college entrance exam was also from their class, and Ye Zhuo was just a clown. ”

“Hearing the mockery in Qian Dabao’s words, Jiang Wenhui smiled and said, “Don’t worry. Even without your blessing, our class’s God Ye will still be able to get the top spot on the gold roll! And he’ll definitely do better than your class’s student Han Lei!” ”

“Qian Dabao was not angry. Instead, he smiled and picked up a cup of tea. “Then I’ll wait and see.” ”

“With tears in his eyes, he was the number one student in the entire grade. How could ye Zao compare to him without plagiarizing? ”

It was simply a fantasy!

“I’ll wait and see.”Jiang Wenhui wasn’t afraid of Qian Dabao.

Qian Dabao put down the textbook in his hands. “I only hope that teacher Jiang won’t find it embarrassing and hide at home!”

“Whoever doesn’t come out will be a grandson!”

Qian Dabao nodded. “It’s good that you said that.”

“Jiang Wenhui was feeling smug now. Once the college entrance examination results were out, let’s see how he would have the face to meet him! ”

Qian Dabao narrowed his eyes. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“At night, after school. ”

“After school, no one was willing to leave. ”

“All of them spontaneously stayed in the classroom, and one by one, they walked up to Ye Zhuo and thanked him. ”

“Although ye Zao had spent a semester with them, her position in the students’hearts was absolutely no less than that of Jiang Wenhui, the class teacher. ”

“This semester, Ye Zao had helped them too much. ”
