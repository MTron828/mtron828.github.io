“When Old Lady Li saw Fang yinyue, the smile on her face immediately disappeared. ”

“When you marry a good wife, marry a shrew, and your home will be restless. ”

Li Sanzhu was a good example.

“Ever since he married Fang yinyue, the Li family had been in chaos! ”

“This time, Fang yinyue directly instigated Li Sanzhu to send his niece, Liu Shuyi, to the police station. ”

This was what her biological uncle and aunt did!

“Old Lady Li said with a cold face, “It’s really hard for your eldest Miss Fang to still remember me as her mother.” ”

“Fang yinyue’s expression froze for a moment, but she remembered that the other party was, after all, an elder, so she had to give Li Sanzhu some face. ”

“”Mom, aren’t you killing me by saying this?”Fang yinyue smiled and said, “Mom, What Time Is Your Flight? You must have not eaten yet, right? Butler, quickly get the kitchen to cook some noodles.” ”

“”Do you need to trouble the kitchen to cook a bowl of Noodles?”Old Lady Li Glanced at Fang yinyue, her eyes full of sarcasm. “This person who became a wife is indeed different!” ”

“At the end of her sentence, old lady li sighed and continued, “This person is old, so he should be dragged to the crematorium. Otherwise, he will be a nuisance in the world!” ”

Today was the first day of the Prairie New Year.

“Upon hearing such words, no one, let alone Fang yinyue, would be too happy. ”

“However, Fang yinyue still held it in and said with a smile, “Then I will personally cook noodles for you. Mom, Please Wait a moment.” ”

“Old Lady Li snorted coldly, her eyes filled with dissatisfaction. ” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Her son was so handsome, nearly 1.83 meters tall. He had a good figure, good looks, good character, and money. He was the richest man in the prairie. ”

Fang yinyue was 1.56 meters short. She didn’t say anything she wanted and had a vicious heart. Her family background was so-so. How could she be worthy of Li Sanzhu!

She didn’t know what Li Sanzhu was thinking back then.

He actually took a fancy to such a person!

“At this moment, Li Sanzhu brought Li Yueyue down from upstairs. “Mom.” ”

“Grandma.”Li Yueyue’s tone was sweet.

“When she saw her son, old madam Li’s expression turned a little better. “Sanzhu.” ”

As for her granddaughter...

“Li Yueyue looked very much like Fang yinyue. Her skin was very white, and her eyes were big. When she smiled, she even had a pair of dimples. ”

This was the appearance that old madam Li hated the most.

“In addition, Li Yueyue did not grow up in front of her, so the affection between them was not very strong. ”

“Old Lady Li’s favorite granddaughter was Li Shuyi. Otherwise, she would not have rushed back from C country for Li Shuyi. ”

“Li Sanzhu continued, “Where’s silvermoon?” ”

“”Who knows where she went!”Old Lady Li replied sarcastically, “Anyway, it’s not the past anymore. My Mother-in-law is just a decoration.”If it was in the past, the daughter-in-law would have to treat her mother-in-law well in the morning and evening, fang yinyue didn’t dare to treat her like this. ”

The housekeeper couldn’t take it anymore. Wasn’t old lady lying through her teeth?

“”Sir, Madam went to the kitchen to cook noodles for old lady.” ”

Li Sanzhu nodded.

“Old Lady Li snorted, “Who knows if she wants to poison me to death!” ”

“Hearing this, Li Yueyue couldn’t hold it in any longer. She was about to say something, but Li Sanzhu grabbed her wrist. “Mom, what are you talking about! yinyue isn’t that kind of person!” ”

It wasn’t easy for Old Lady Li to return to the country. Li Sanzhu didn’t want her to quarrel with him the moment she returned.

The old lady was almost 80 years old this year!

It was said that a child wanted to be taken care of but couldn’t be taken care of. He also didn’t want to do something that he would regret.

“”People’s hearts are different. Who knows what kind of person she is!”Old Lady Li continued, “Just like you! How could a biological uncle send his niece to prison!” ”

“Hearing this, Li Sanzhu couldn’t help but look up at Old Mrs. Li, “Mom, What You Said is wrong! What do you mean I sent Shuyi to prison? If she didn’t do anything wrong, would I be able to force her? Mom, I know that you have always been biased toward Shuyi, but you can’t be so biased! Think about it. Yueyue has grown up. has she ever eaten a candy that you gave her? “There’s also silvermoon. Silvermoon has always treated you with great respect, but how have you treated her! “Not to mention treating her like a daughter, you’re even treating her worse than an outsider!” ”

“Li Sanzhu was very angry, very angry. ”

“When he thought of his mother’s actions over the years, his eyes turned slightly red. ”

“Because Old Lady Li had always lived abroad, the husband and wife would visit her twice a year. Each time, they would leave 150,000 yuan for her to retire, which was 300,000 yuan a year. ”
