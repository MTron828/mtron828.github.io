Chapter 84: 073: go to the capital, the anniversary party! 5

Even though that was what he said.

But who didn’t want to Live Well?

Especially since the old man still had a very important wish that hadn’t been fulfilled.

There was only a disappointed sigh in the air.

Soon.

The plane arrived at the capital airport. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Sun Fu Nian helped the old man off the plane.

“Old Man Yang.”At this moment, a deep male voice came from behind.

Old Master Yang raised his head and saw that the person who came was a young man in his thirties. His facial features were cold and handsome. Although he was not old, the aura of a superior who looked down on the world was not to be underestimated!

Was this the Cen family’s fifth elder who was known as CEN Fifth Master?

Although Old Master Yang had only met Cen Shaoqing once, this young man was too outstanding. There was no junior in the capital who could compare to him.

Hence, old master Yang recognized him at once.

“CEN Fifth Master.”Old Master Yang stopped in his tracks and looked up.

Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads. “Old Master, you’re too kind. You’re an elder, you can just call me by my name.”

Hearing this, Old Master Yang looked at Cen Shaoqing with a hint of admiration in his eyes. “No need to be modest. You can take on this CEN fifth master title.”

Cen Shaoqing became famous in a single battle at a young age. Although he was not old, the CEN family was currently an existence that overshadowed the heavens in China. Their seniority and prestige were very high.

Therefore, they could afford to be called fifth master Cen by Old Master Yang.

The two of them exchanged a few pleasantries,

after the old man left, Li Qiandong walked in front of Cen Shaoqing and said with a sigh, “It’s said that the old patriarch of the Yang family is seriously ill and doesn’t have much time left. I thought it was just a rumor, but I didn’t expect it to be true.”

After saying that, Li Qiandong continued, “It seems that the Yang family is going to change!”

Just now, Old Master Yang’s condition was terrible to the extreme. Even someone like him who didn’t know much about medicine knew that he didn’t have much time left.

The Yang family was the head of the top ten wealthy families in the capital.

Back then, Old Master Yang was also a legendary figure. Unfortunately, the hero was dying.

Now, who knew how many people were waiting for grandfather Yang to fall!

Cen Shaoqing did not reply. The red prayer beads went around the back of his white hand and looked at the front of the crowd indifferently.

There were two young women standing in front of them.

One of them was wearing a beige down jacket and was talking to a little girl beside her.

The little girl was wearing a beige overcoat. The buttons of the overcoat were unbuttoned. Her long legs were slender and she wore a khaki English hat on her head. She lowered her head slightly to listen to her companion’s voice. The wide brim of the hat covered her eyes and brows, only a part of her fair chin could be seen.

Although her face could not be seen, the penetrating aura around her was hard to miss.

The walking crowd at the side had unknowingly become her background.

Li Qiandong looked around and said in surprise, “Isn’t that the Almighty? Fifth Brother, let’s Go Say Hello!”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and walked forward.

“Great God?”

Hearing this, Ye Zao raised his eyes slightly, revealing a plain white face.

He was clearly facing the sky and wasn’t wearing any makeup, but his beauty was exquisite and soul-stirring.

“The Great God is really you!”Seeing that this person was really ye Zao, Li Qiandong was very excited.

Ye Zao smiled slightly and took the initiative to greet him, “Mr. Li, Mr. Cen.”

CEN shaoqing nodded slightly, “Miss Ye.”

Li Qiandong continued, “God, why are you here in the capital? By the way, who is this?”

Ye Zao said concisely, “I’m here for some business. This is my good friend, Lin Sha Sha. Sister Sha Sha, this is Mr. Cen, and this is Mr. Li.”

Just Li Qiandong alone was enough to surprise Lin Sha.

Moreover, Li Qiandong had cen shaoqing standing next to him. The aura of a man that was born to be an overlord made the air around them oppressive.

Lin Sha was so nervous that she stuttered, “Hello, Hello.”

She looked at ye Zao again. He still looked indifferent.

Ye Zao was too powerful!

How could he remain so calm under such circumstances!

Lin Sha felt a sense of admiration in her heart.

Li Qiandong continued, “God, this is your first time in the capital, right? Let’s go, I’ll be the host today. I’ll bring you to the capital to have some fun! At the same time, you can familiarize yourself with the environment.”

“Thank you. We’ve already booked a hotel, so we won’t trouble the two of you.”Ye Zhuo declined politely.

Cen Shaoqing replied indifferently, “The driver who picked us up is here. If you don’t mind, Miss Ye, we can get our driver to give you a ride.”

As soon as he finished speaking, a luxurious extended Lincoln stopped in front of them.
