“Chapter 496: 129: Lin Jincheng reveals the truth of what happened that year, and mother and son will finally recognize each other! 3”

“Thinking of this, the corners of Feng Qianhua’s mouth curled up even more.”

“Her daughter was so outstanding, and as a mother, she was also proud!”

“”Mom, don’t worry, I know what to do.”For today’s engagement party, Feng Qianxian had prepared for a long time.”

“How to smile was the most attractive, and what topics to participate in appeared to be knowledgeable and cultured.”

“In order to cater to fifth master Cen’s preferences, she even specially flipped through some scripture books and recited some relatively famous fragments.”

She believed that she would definitely have a common topic with fifth master Cen.

“So today, she would definitely attract fifth master Cen’s attention.”

Make Fifth Master Cen fall for her.

“Feng Qianhua continued, “Xianxian, you can’t just think about attracting fifth master Cen’s attention. You have to think about how to please old Madam Cen. Although Old Madam Cen is old, her weight in the Cen family is definitely not inferior to Zhou Xiang.””

“I heard that fifth master Cen did not want to go to Yun Jing previously. It was only because Old Lady Cen threatened him with her life that he agreed to go.”

“”Once Old Lady Cen approves of you, then you will be the Cen family’s matriarch.””

“Because the relationship between the Cen family and the Lin family was not bad, Old Lady Lin could always tell some topics about the CEN family.” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Feng Xianxian nodded, “Isn’t it just to please the old lady? Look at how happy I made that Old Lady Lin! I’m the best at this! Now that I think about it, the eldest daughter of the Mu family in Yunjing is really stupid! She’s short-sighted. Fifth Master Cen only used a little trick, and she took the initiative to break off the engagement! But I still have to thank her. If it weren’t for her short-sightedness, I wouldn’t have had the chance to get in touch with fifth master Cen Now.””

“Feng Qianhua reached out and placed her hand on Feng Xianxian’s. “If you don’t have the chance, create it. Opportunities are always reserved for those who are prepared.”Just like her, if she had accepted her fate nineteen years ago.., then would she still be able to become the matriarch of the Lin Family?”

“Therefore, one must never accept one’s fate!”

“”Even if fifth master Cen already has someone by his side, you can’t give up. As long as fifth master Cen can see you, it means that he still doesn’t love his female companion enough!””

“Feng Xianxian nodded, not fully understanding. “Yes, Mom, I understand.””

“Just then, Feng Qianhua’s eldest sister-in-law walked in from outside and said with a smile, “Qianhua, are you hungry? Do you want sister-in-law to bring you something to eat?”Normally, Feng Qianhua’s eldest sister-in-law would not have such a good expression.”

“But now, it was different. Feng Qianhua was about to get engaged to Lin Jincheng. The Lin family was big and powerful. In the future, even if Feng Qianhua revealed something between her fingers, it would be enough for her to Squander.”

“Although it was already too late for Lin Jincheng to pick Feng Qianhua up, he had already prepared two auspicious times!”

She could not offend Feng Qianhua again because of her short-sightedness.

“Feng Qianhua did not stand on ceremony with sister-in-law. “Then I’ll have to trouble sister-in-law to get me a bowl of porridge. My appetite has not been very good recently, so I want to have some porridge.””

“”Okay, I’ll go now.””

“Feng Qianqian looked at Feng Qianqian’s back, her eyes filled with pride. “Can I trouble you to get me a bowl of porridge too?””

“Her first aunt was the most snobbish, and she usually liked to bully the mother and daughter. Who would have thought that she would have such a day!”

Feng Qianqian was overjoyed!

“”Yes, yes, of course.”Feng Qianqian quickly nodded.”

“After Feng Qianhua’s eldest sister-in-law left, Feng Qianhua’s second sister-in-law, third sister-in-law, and fourth sister-in-law also walked in.”

They came here to please Feng Qianhua.

Feng Qianxian ordered her three aunts to take care of her like she was ordering the servants of the Lin family.

The three Feng sisters-in-law could only swallow their anger.

Who asked her to become the eldest daughter of the Lin Family!

The difference between the Feng family and the Lin family was not just a little bit.

At the same time.

Downstairs.

“As the discussions among the guests increased, old madam Feng became more and more uncertain.”

What was going on with the Lin Family?

Why was no one here yet?

Did something really happen?

“Just then, the butler jogged in. Old Madam Feng saw that the butler’s expression did not seem to be right, so she immediately walked over and asked in a low voice, “What is going on with the Lin Family?””

The housekeeper glanced at old madam Feng and was momentarily at a loss for words.

The Feng family was bustling with activity as they prepared for the engagement banquet.

“However, the groom-to-be announced that the wedding banquet was canceled. He even announced that he would only love his son’s birth mother and would not be engaged to anyone else.”

“If this news were to spread, what would the Feng family and Feng Qianhua do?”
