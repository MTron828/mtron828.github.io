“That feeling was as if she, the eldest princess of Korea, was not even worth mentioning in front of ye Zao. ”

Her good upbringing did not allow Jin Yuyan to express her anger.

“The assistant quickly reacted at this moment. “Princess, she, she said, she said...”at this point, the assistant paused and continued, “Princess, that Chinese must be bragging. How Old is she? According to my information, she is only 20 years old. She grew up in a small city...” ”

Jin Yuyan held the cup tightly. Her knuckles had turned slightly white because she had used too much strength.

“Upstairs, Bai Xiaosu was stroking the cat. When he saw ye Zao, he immediately put down the cat and ran over, “Miss Ye.” ”

“Normally, ye Zao would also stroking the cat, but today, it was very obvious that the situation was not right. “Let’s go back.” ”

“Okay.”Bai Xiaosu nodded and did not ask any more questions. He followed ye Zao’s footsteps.

“When they reached downstairs, Jin Yuyan’s people had not left yet. ”

Jin Yuyan sat in the restaurant. She looked at ye Zao and Bai Xiaosu’s backs and frowned.

Just wait.

She would definitely make ye Zhuo become a citizen of Korea.

Korea must also win this shooting competition.

A luxurious Lincoln Limousine was parked outside the dining room. One look and it was obvious that it was Jin Yuyan’s exclusive mount.

“Bai Xiaosu lowered his voice and said, “That princess hasn’t left yet?” ”

“Probably.”Ye Zhuo did not care about Jin Yuyan’s departure.

“Bai Xiaosu continued, “Miss Ye, the princess didn’t make things difficult for you just now, right?” ”

“Before ye Zao could answer, Bai Xiaosu smiled and said, “Why would I ask such a stupid question? Even if the princess wanted to make things difficult for you, I’m afraid she wouldn’t be able to find a reason.” ”

Not to mention one Jin Yuyan.

“Even if there were ten Jin Yuyan, they wouldn’t be able to make things difficult for ye Zao. ”

“Back at the training camp, Bai Xiaosu continued to train while ye Zao guided him from the side. ”

In the blink of an eye.

It was the day of the official competition.

“From the hotel to the real competition zone, it required a two-hour car ride. ”

The competition started at 1 pm. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“At 10 am, Ye Zao and Bai Xiaosu got into the car. ”

“The competition was about to start. Bai Xiaosu was a little nervous. “Miss Ye, what if I don’t get first place?” ”

“Don’t worry.”Ye Zhuo patted her hand. “The ranking is secondary. The most important thing is to participate.”

“Ye Zhuo’s voice was very faint, but it seemed to be tinged with magic. Bai Xiaosu immediately stopped being nervous. In his heart, he had secretly decided that he would definitely get first place in a while! ”

“After saying that, ye Zhuo continued, “Xiaosu, Jin Yuyan is very ambitious. She definitely won’t let it go. In the competition later, you have to be careful.” ”

“Bai Xiaosu nodded. “Don’t worry, Miss Ye. I will.” ”

“After living in society for so many years, Bai Xiaosu was not the kind of little white who didn’t know anything. ”

“If he really didn’t know anything, Bai Xiaosu would not have what he had today. ”

“Ye Zao leaned against the back of his chair. His gaze swept past the rearview mirror. He narrowed his eyes and said, “Speed up.” ”

“Hearing this, the driver immediately sped up. ”

“Faster.”Ye Zao said.

“”What’s wrong, Miss Ye?”Bai Xiaosu looked at ye Zao. ”

“There’s someone following us.”Ye Zao said.

“Who?”Bai Xiaosu immediately opened the window and looked behind.

“Although it was not rush hour, there were still many cars on the road. ”

“For a moment, Bai Xiaosu really could not tell which car was following them. ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “That Black Toyota Camry.” ”

Bai Xiaosu immediately fixed his gaze on the Toyota Camry in the traffic. “Is it the one with the license plate number CR556?”

“Yes.”

Bai Xiaosu then noticed that the car was indeed very abnormal. There were three people in the car. The person sitting in the passenger seat was even holding a pair of binoculars. “It must be Jin Yuyan’s people!”

Today was the day of the competition. Jin Yuyan had suddenly arranged for someone to follow them at such a time. She must have had other intentions!

“”Miss Ye, what should we do now?”Bai Xiaosu turned to look at ye Zao. ”

Ye Zao’s expression remained the same. “Shake them off.”

“At this moment, the driver in the front seat turned around. “The other party’s driving skills are too good. I, I can’t shake them off!” ”

The person sent by Jin Yuyan was a professional racer.

“The driver tried many methods, but the other party still stuck to them like a dog skin plaster. ”

“Pull over.”Ye Zao’s tone was shallow.

“Okay.”The driver immediately slowed down and pulled over.
