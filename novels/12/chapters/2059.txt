Translator: 549690339

“”Thanks to Madam, I’ve already found my parents and brother,”ye Zhuo continued. ”

Found Them!

Zhao Dan was stunned.

How could ye Zhuo have found his parents!

She must have been deceived.

“Zhao Dan said without batting an eyelid, “Then congratulations to Miss Ye. I wonder if I have the honor to meet your father and your mother? To be able to give birth to such an outstanding daughter like Miss Ye, your father and your mother must not be an ordinary person!” ”

She really wanted to see who it was that actually dared to impersonate her!

What audacity!

“”It might be a little inconvenient,”ye Zhuo rejected tactfully. ”

“Zhao Dan said, “It’s also because I was too abrupt.” ”

“After saying that, Zhao Dan said again, “Miss Ye, don’t take it to heart. I just saw that you felt that it was too cordial, so i...” ”

“Speaking up to this point, Zhao Dan sighed, he continued, “Miss Ye, you should know that I have an elder daughter called Full Moon. Unfortunately, this child is blessed. When she was almost two years old, she was kidnapped! Her father and I searched for her for a few years, but we were unable to find her... ... All these years, I’ve been thinking about her in my heart. Everyone says that she’s dead, but I don’t believe it ... .. ”

“At the end, Zhao Dan’s face was already covered in tears, and he was sobbing uncontrollably. ”

“Ye Zhuo turned to look at Zhao Dan and continued, “Don’t be too sad. Perhaps you don’t have a mother-daughter relationship with her.” ”

“Hearing this, Zhao Dan was stunned. ”

She felt that ye Zhuo’s words had two meanings.

Could it be...

Ye Zhuo had discovered something?

No.

Definitely not.

Even she was not sure if ye Zhuo was a full moon or not.

How could ye Zhuo possibly suspect anything!

“Moreover, they had never met before. ”

“Zhao Dan said with red eyes, “But she is, after all, a piece of flesh that fell from my own body. As a parent, it would be a lie to say that I’m not sad or that I don’t feel anything at all! “Ever since the full moon disappeared, I haven’t had a good sleep in the past 19 years. As long as I fall asleep, I think of her... “... “.. ”

Ye Zhuo took a sip of tea and said nothing.

“Zhao dan then said: “Even if there is a star and Wen Er, I still can not forget my eldest daughter, I really miss her...”. Miss Ye, perhaps you can’t understand my feelings now. When you have children and become a parent, you will understand my feelings now. Do you know what it’s like not to have a good night’s sleep for nineteen years ”

“Ye Zhuo turned his eyes slightly and opened his red lips slightly. “I see that your skin is so good. You must have taken regular care of it, right?” ”

Care?

Zhao Dan was stunned. She was talking about the full moon. Why would ye Zhuo suddenly mention care?

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “My mother is about the same age as you. Because she has suffered a lot before, her skin is much worse than yours.” ”

Zhao Dan was naturally not a fool to be able to sit in the position of the mother of the nation. She instantly understood the hidden meaning behind ye Zhuo’s words and an awkward expression flashed across her face.

Ye Zhuo’s words were clearly questioning her.

“She said that she had not slept well for nineteen years, but why did her skin take such good care of itself! ”

She was really sharp-tongued!

She did not give her any face at all.

Would her daughter be so insensible?

“Manxing was much gentler than her. If ye Zhuo was really a full moon, his personality should be similar to Manxing’s. After all, they were two sisters. ”

“Not to mention that she was an elder in front of ye Zao, she was also the First Lady of man Xing country. ”

Ye Zao contradicted her like that. It was obvious that he did not take her seriously. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

He did not have any manners at all.

“Zhao dan continued, “Then your mother must be very beautiful.” ”

Ye Zao nodded slightly. “My mother is naturally the most beautiful mother in the world.”

“Zhao dan smiled and echoed, “No wonder you can raise such a beautiful daughter. I really envy your mother.” ”

“”Princess Manxing is also very good,”ye Zao said. ”

“At the mention of Manxing, the smile in Zhao Dan’s eyes could not be hidden at all, “If her sister was still in her full moon state, she would definitely be more outstanding than her! Miss Ye, if I’m not mistaken, the moment I saw you, I immediately thought of my full moon. If the full moon was still around, she would definitely be as outstanding as Miss Ye.” ”

Ye Zao smiled slightly. “Ye Zao’s luck is thin. I don’t dare to compare myself to the full moon Princess.”
