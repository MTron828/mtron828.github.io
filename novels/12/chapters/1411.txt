He became a little unfamiliar.

Zhou Zuolong could not help but feel his heart thump.

“Zhou Xiang continued, “Zhou Zuolong, my mother has been married to you for so many years. Even if you really don’t love her anymore, there’s no need to force her into a dead end! Why, why do you have to treat my mother like this?” ”

Zhou Zuolong did not expect Zhou Xiang to talk to him with such an attitude.

It’s the other way around! It’s the other way around!

This unfilial daughter!

“Zhou Zuolong raised his hand, wanting to give Zhou Xiang a slap. ”

“But at that moment, his hand was grabbed by someone. ”

The person who grabbed Zhou Zuolong was Zhou Xiang.

“Actually, Zhou Xiang had also practiced before. Previously, she just did not fight back. ”

“That year, when Zhou Xiang married into the Cen family, Old Mrs. Cen saw that she had such a soft personality and was worried that she would be bullied, so she hired a Sanda coach for her. ”

“Although Zhou Xiang’s skills could not be considered the best, it was more than enough to deal with people like Zhou Zuolong. ”

Zhou Zuolong looked at Zhou Xiang in disbelief. “Vile daughter! Are you trying to rebel?”

Who would have thought that the soft and tofu-like Zhou Xiang would actually dare to rebel against Zhou Zuolong?

“Zhou Xiang said, “From the moment you betrayed my mother, you were no longer my father! Zhou Zuolong, you disgust me!” ”

“”Xiang Xiang, are you crazy? Quickly let go of your father!”Xie wanqiu’s voice sounded from the side. ”

“Zhou Xiang turned to look at Xie wanqiu. “Right, and you!” ”

“After saying that, she casually picked up the vase on the table and threw it at Xie Wanqiu’s head. ”

Xie Wanqiu was dumbfounded.

“”Grandma, be careful!”At the critical moment, Zheng Wanyin pushed Xie wanqiu to the side. ”

Bang!

The vase fell to the ground.

One could imagine what would happen if the vase landed on Xie Wanqiu’s head.

“”Second aunt, let’s talk it out. Don’t do anything.”Zheng Wanyin stood in front of Xie wanqiu. “They are your biological parents!” ”

“Although Xie Wanqiu was not Zhou Xiang’s biological mother, she was not much different from her biological mother. ”

“Bastard! Who Do you think you are!”Zhou Xiang waved Zheng wanyin away.

“Zheng Wanyin was flung to the ground, unable to resist at all. ”

Bastard.

Zheng Wanyin looked at Zhou Xiang in disbelief.

Zhou Xiang actually called her a bastard?

Zhou Xiang walked in front of Xie Wanqiu again. He grabbed Xie Wanqiu’s hair with one hand and slapped Xie wanqiu hard with the other. “You owe my mother this slap.”

“Then, she slapped Xie wanqiu hard again. “You owe us this slap!” ”

“After two slaps, Zhou Xiang still felt angry and kicked Xie wanqiu a few more times. ”

Xie Wanqiu was stunned.

“She thought Zhou Xiang came to apologize, but she didn’t expect Zhou Xiang to hit her directly! ”

“Old Mrs. Cen, who was hiding outside the door, was overjoyed when she saw this scene. She almost applauded and cheered for Zhou Xiang! ”

It seemed that she was worrying too much. Zhou Xiang was much smarter than she had imagined.

“When Zhou Xiang came out of the ward again, it was already half an hour later. ”

“In the ward, Xie Wanqiu and Zhou Jinbei were covered in injuries. ”

Even Zheng Wanyin was not spared.

“”WANQIU, are you alright?”Zhou Zuolong crawled to Xie Wanqiu’s side. ”

“Xie wanqiu shook her head, “I’m fine, Old Man. What should we do now? The public opinion on the Internet is already very unfavorable to us, and Xiang Xiang is treating us like this! If only Ying ‘er was still alive. Ying ‘er will definitely seek justice for me.” ”

“Zhou zuolong said, “Wanqiu, don’t worry. I will definitely seek justice for her. Zhou Xiang, that evil daughter, I think she’s tired of living!” ”

Xie Wanqiu was a treasure in Zhou Zuolong’s hands.

But Zhou Xiang had treated her like this!

Zhou Xiang was finished!

“Even if he had to risk his life, Zhou Zuolong would make Zhou Xiang and Zhou Jinbei, the two siblings, pay the price. ”

“Xie wanqiu looked up at Zhou Zuolong. “Old Man, do you have a way?” ”

“”Yes.”Zhou Zuolong nodded. “Wanqiu, in any case, I won’t let you suffer this injustice in vain.” ”

Zhou Zuolong was Zhou Xiang’s biological father after all.

“Since Zhou Zuolong said that there was a way, there must be a way. ”

“Hearing this, Xie Wanqiu narrowed her eyes. ”

“Zhou Xiang, this little B * TCH, just you wait! ”

“Moreover, it was a hundred times the price! ”

“Early the next morning, Zhou Zuolong took a fruit knife and left the hospital early in the morning. ”

Yes.

He had the intention to kill.

“As his daughter, Zhou Xiang actually dared to treat him like this. ” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“And now, the public opinion on the internet was completely focused on him. ”

“Since Zhou Xiang and Zhou Zuolong did not let him have a good time, let’s perish together! ”

He was already in his seventies this year.

It was really worth it to take away two young people.

“Before he left, Zhou Zuolong also wrote a will and a bank card. In the will, he entrusted Xie Wanqiu and Zheng Wanyin to Wu Youyu’s care. ”

“After all, Wu Youyu and Xie wanqiu were from the same hometown, and he had saved Xie Wanqiu’s life. ”

Zhou Zuolong was very relieved to entrust Xie wanqiu to Wu Youyu’s care.

The money in that bank card was enough for Xie Wanqiu and Zheng Wanyin to live for the rest of their lives.

“Zhou Zuolong had just walked out of the door when he was stopped by a child. “Hello, Are You Mr. Zhou Zuolong?” ”

“Before Zhou Zuolong could say anything, the child stuffed the thing in his hand into Zhou Zuolong’s hand. “Old Sir, an uncle asked me to give this to you.”With that, he ran away. ”

What was this?

“Looking at the envelope in his hand, Zhou Zuolong frowned. ”

Could it be some kind of threatening letter?

It was said that those who suffered cyber violence would often receive threatening letters.

“Zhou Zuolong walked to the side of the trash can and was about to throw the envelope away, but after some thought, he opened the envelope. ”

“He wasn’t even afraid of death, so what was there to be afraid of? ”

“When he opened the envelope, he saw that it was full of photos. ”

“When he saw the contents of the photos, Zhou Zuolong was stunned. ”

The color on his face instantly disappeared.

Who was this man and woman in the photos?

Xie Wanqiu and Wu Youyu?

Boom!

“At this moment, Zhou Zuolong felt like the sky was falling. ”

How could this be?

How could this be

How could Xie Wanqiu get together with Wu Youyu?

“B * Tch! B * Tch!”
