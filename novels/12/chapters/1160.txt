“Ye Zhuo continued, “Regarding the contract, do you think there are any problems?” ”

“”No!”Jiang Chao said straightforwardly, “This contract is the most equal contract I’ve seen in My 40 plus years of Practice!” ”

Under normal circumstances.

There were more or less some unreasonable aspects in a contract.

Party A’s father would always be in an advantageous position.

“However, Jiang Chao had studied the contract very carefully just now. ”

There wasn’t the slightest illogical aspect to this contract.

It was fair and just!

Party B was no longer the disadvantaged party.

“Jiang Chao had been in the financial world for so many years, but he had never come across such a contract. ”

“That’s good.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

Jiang Chao picked up a pen and began to sign the contract.

“In a flash, the contract was signed. “President Ye, please take a look.” ”

Perhaps Jiang Chao himself didn’t realize that he had unconsciously used honorifics during his conversation with Ye Zhuo.

“Ye Zhuo took the contract with both hands and continued, “Alright. That’s all for now. There will be people going to the Jiang Financial Group to work on the docking tomorrow. Please make the arrangements.” ”

“”Okay.”Jiang Chao nodded. “President Ye, don’t worry.” ”

“Ye Zhuo picked up the hat on the table and put it on his head. “Uncle Jiang, Xiaoyu, I still have something to do. I’ll be leaving first.” ”

“Jiang Xiaoyu said, “It’s almost time for dinner. Let’s Find a place and eat before we leave.” ”

“Jiang Chao said, “Xiaoyu is right.” ”

Ye Zhuo looked back slightly. “I’m full from the dessert just now.”

Jiang Chao and Jiang Xiaoyu sent ye Zhuo out of the cafe.

“Looking at Ye Zhuo’s back, Jiang Xiaoyu said, “Dad, what do you think of Miss Ye?” ”

“Jiang Chao said, “She has the bearing of a member of the Ye family!” ”

“What about compared to Zhao Xueyin?”Jiang Xiaoyu continued to ask.

“Jiang Chao narrowed his eyes and said, “They are not on the same level.” ”

“Although Zhao Xueyin was also famous, compared to Ye Zhuo, Zhao Xueyin was still a little petty. ”

“Whether it was her image, temperament, or business talent, ye Zao was above Zhao Xueyin. ”

“After a while, Jiang Chao turned to look at Jiang Xiaoyu. “Xiaoyu, you didn’t make the wrong friend! Miss Ye’s future actions will definitely dazzle everyone!” ”

For the first time.

“For the first time in her life, Jiang Xiaoyu was affirmed by her father. She smiled and said, “I think so too!” ”

On the other side.

Shunxi Financial Group.

Zhao Xueyin had been waiting for Jiang Xiaoyu to come and apologize to her.

“However, there was no news from Jiang Xiaoyu’s side the whole day. ”

Zhao Xueyin frowned slightly.

Something didn’t seem right

“Logically speaking, Jiang Xiaoyu should have arrived a long time ago. ”

She still needed to borrow Jiang Xiaoyu’s hand to feed ye Zao the medicine.

“Thinking of that pill, a vicious light flashed in Zhao Xueyin’s eyes. ”

Wait for it.

“This time, she must let ye Zhuo get the retribution he deserves! ”

“When the time comes, Ye Zhuo just wait for the fame to spread! ”

“Annie looked at Zhao Xueyin, “Miss Zhao, do you think Miss Jiang is angry?” ”

“Zhao Xueyin eyes are all cynical look,”angry? What right does a dog have to be angry?” ”

Annie frowned. “Did she find someone else to help?”

“Impossible!”

Although there were many large financial groups in the financial world.

“But now, the Jiang Financial Group was no longer of any use, and everyone avoided it! ”

“Other than her, there was no one else who could bring the Jiang Financial Group back to life! ”

“Other than her, who else could Jiang Xiaoyu find? ”

Who else could help the Jiang Financial Group?

She was the only savior of the Jiang Financial Group!

“If the Jiang family wanted to continue to survive in the financial world, they had to come and beg her! ”

“Annie continued, “Miss Zhao, why don’t I go and check it out?” ”

“”Let’s Wait a little longer.”Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes. “Tomorrow, she’ll definitely come tomorrow!” ”

Zhao Xueyin had a feeling that Jiang Xiaoyu would definitely come and beg her tomorrow!

Annie nodded. “Alright.”

“Auntie Wang had not come to work all this while, which made Granny Zhou a little puzzled. “Jiayue, why haven’t I seen Auntie Wang these past few days?” ”

“Ma Jiayue said with a natural expression, “I forgot to tell you that Auntie Wang had some matters at home a few days ago and resigned from the housekeeper’s side! She Won’t be coming to work at our house in the future.” ”

“”Resigned?”Granny Zhou said, “If there’s anything, why don’t you just take two days off? Why did you have to resign?” ”

“Auntie Wang usually worked very seriously and was a very nice person. When she suddenly heard that Auntie Wang had resigned, Granny Zhou was quite surprised. ”

“Besides, her salary was usually not low, so there was no reason for Auntie Wang to resign. ”

“Ma Jiayue said, “Maybe it’s something big with Auntie Wang!” ”

“Granny Zhou frowned. “Even if there’s something big to resign, you should have told me. I’ve always been kind to her! What she did was really unfair!”Granny Zhou really wasn’t bad to Auntie Wang, usually, she would ask Auntie Wang to bring back a portion of any delicious food. Occasionally, Auntie Wang would take a leave of absence, and Granny Zhou would not deduct her salary! ”
