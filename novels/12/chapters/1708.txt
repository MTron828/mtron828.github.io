Ye Shu had just left the pet shop with the dog when she received a message from Gu Dening.

“”Ye Sen, wait for me here.” ”

“What’s Wrong?”Ye Sen turned to look at Ye Shu.

“Ye Shu continued, “Dening sent me a message saying that they have come out of the coffee shop. I’ll go ask Dening about the situation.” ”

“After saying that, Ye Shu handed the dog to Ye Sen. ”

Ye Sen stood there and waited for Ye Shu.

He was a little anxious.

Ye Shu came to the entrance of the coffee shop.

Gu De Ning and Chu Jie were standing at the entrance and chatting.

“De Ning.”Ye Shu jogged over.

“Mrs. Lin.”

“Ye Shu held Gu de Ning’s arm and asked in a low voice, “How do you feel?” ”

“Chu Jie’s image was impeccable. Gu de Ning continued, “Chu Jie is quite outstanding, but...” ”

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “It’s good that he’s outstanding. Then, you guys can add each other on wechat first. Relationships are slowly cultivated. If it’s really not suitable, it’s okay. Just treat it as making friends. “These things are consensual. decing, you don’t have to feel pressured.” ”

“Okay.”Gu decing nodded.

“Ye Shu continued, “Then that’s all for now. You guys can talk when you get back.” ”

“”Okay, Mrs. Lin. I’ll go back first.” ”

Ye Shu turned to look at Chu Jie again. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Chu Jie immediately understood. “Miss Gu, let me drive you.” ”

“Gu dening smiled and said, “I drove here.” ”

“”Okay then.”Chu Jie continued, “Let’s watch a movie together when we have time!” ”

“Okay.”

“Looking at Gu Dening’s back, ye Shu smiled and looked at Chu Jie. “How is it?” ”

“”Miss Gu is a very good girl.”Chu Jie paused and continued, “I just don’t know if she’ll like me.” ”

“Ye Shu patted Chu Jie’s shoulder. “You work hard and it shouldn’t be a problem. If it really doesn’t work, Auntie will introduce you to other girls.” ”

“”Thank you, Auntie.” ”

“”You’re welcome.”Ye Shu continued, “Your Uncle Ye is still waiting for me over there, I’ll go over first.” ”

“You go ahead.”

Ye Shu walked towards the direction of the pet shop.

“Ye Sen was still waiting there. When he saw ye Shu coming over, he couldn’t wait to run over, “Sis! How was it?” ”

“How was what?”Ye Shu asked.

“How did they look?”Ye Sen asked.

“”Oh, you mean this!”Ye Shu took the dog from Ye Sen’s arms and continued, “They looked pretty good!” ”

Pretty Good?

How could that be? !

“Ye Sen continued, “Sister, are you kidding me? They don’t look compatible at all. How could they look pretty good?” ”

“Ye Shu looked up at Ye Sen and narrowed her eyes. “Tell me, are you interested in De Ning?” ”

“”No,”ye Sen denied. ”

“Ye Shu continued, “Since you’re not interested, why do you care so much about the couple?” ”

Couple?

So soon?

“Sis! Don’t make fun of me on purpose!”Ye Sen was very anxious.

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “Didn’t you say that you’re not interested in De Ning? Since you’re not interested, why do you care what I say!” ”

Ye Sen choked in his heart and didn’t know how to refute.

“Ye Shu continued, “Ye Sen, stop pretending! I’ve watched you grow up. How can I not understand you? Is it that hard to admit that you like De Ning?” ”

“Ye Sen took off all his pretense. “Sis, I’m convinced by you! I’m really convinced!” ”

“”Since you like her, why didn’t you say it earlier? Why did you have to wait for De Ning to go on a blind date with someone else!”Ye Shu said a little angrily, “This is all your own doing!” ”

“”Sister, please help me think of a way! What should we do now?” ”

“”How would I know what to do?”Ye Shu continued, “I just introduced De Ning to Chu Jie. What would it look like if you interfered at this time?” ”

It was neither good nor bad!

“Moreover, the Lin family and the Chu family were old friends! ”

Ye Sen frowned. “Then what if De Ning really becomes Chu Jie?”

“”Then you can only blame yourself for not being fated!”Ye Shu was so angry that she poked ye Sen’s head with her finger. “I asked you to go on a blind date a long time ago, but you didn’t want to! If you had agreed to go on a blind date, would things have turned out like this?” ”

Ye Sen sighed.

“”Let’s wait another week.”Ye Shu looked at Ye Sen, “Wait a week, then I’ll ask De Ning about the situation. “If De Ning and Chujie don’t succeed, you should work hard yourself. Happiness is earned by yourself. If you don’t do anything, are you going to wait for the girl to come and confess to You?” ”
