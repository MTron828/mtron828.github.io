If only his mother was here.

Would it hurt to see him like this...

“”Auntie, can I Hug You?”Lin Ze asked with a stifled voice. ”

“Chu Su reached out to hug Lin Ze. “Child, do you Miss Your Mother?” ”

“Yes.”Lin Ze uttered a syllable from his nose.

“Being hugged by Chu Su like this, Lin Ze felt as if he was really being hugged by his own mother. ”

It would be great if he and Li Wen were really brothers.

“Then, he would have a mother. ”

“Thinking about how this child had never had a mother since he was young and how he had suffered so much today, Chu Su’s eyes turned red as well, “If you miss your mother in the future, come to Auntie’s house with Wenwen. All of you are good brothers and are of the same age. If you don’t mind, you can treat me as your mother.” ”

Lin Ze couldn’t help but cry.

Chu Su patted Lin Ze’s back gently.

The eyes of the other three people in the house were also red.

“In a moment, Lin Ze released Chu Su and bowed to her. “Auntie, thank you.” ”

“Chu Su wiped her tears and smiled. “You don’t have to be so polite to Auntie. You guys can chat upstairs. If you need anything, just let me know.” ”

“After saying that, Chu Su turned around and went downstairs. ”

She left the space for the children.

“”Brother Ze, what do you plan to do now?”Li Wen asked. ”

“Lin Ze turned to look out the window. “I want to go to Yun Jing.”Since they had completely fallen out this time, he had nothing to worry about. ”

“Fat Tiger was anxious. “Then, will you come back in the future?” ”

Lin Ze shook his head.

He didn’t know.

“Right now, he only wanted to find his mother. He didn’t have the time to think about other things. ”

“Dog two continued, “Brother ZE, the college entrance exam is coming up soon. You should wait until after the college entrance exam to go to Yun Jing. During this period of time, you can stay at my house.” ”

“Li Wen said, “There’s no need to go to your house. It’s good enough for brother Ze to stay at my house.” ”

“Fat Tiger said, “You can also go to my house!” ”

“At that moment, there was a knock on the door. ”

Li Wen walked over to open the door.

It was none other than Chu Su.

“”Mom, is there something you need?” ”

“Chu Su looked up at the room and said in a low voice, “Ah Ze’s housekeeper is here. He said that the old lady already knows that she misunderstood ah ze. Now, he asked the housekeeper to invite him back.” ”

“After that.., chu Su added, “The housekeeper said that the old lady is very regretful now. She shouldn’t have hit Ah Ze, and she shouldn’t have chased ah ze away without any reason. As long as Ah Ze is willing to go home, the old lady will apologize to Ah Ze.” ”

“Hearing that, Li Wen nodded. “Okay, Mom, I got it. I’ll tell brother Ze right away.” ”

Chu Su nodded. “Then I’ll go down first.”

“After Chu Su left, Li Wen returned to his room and told Lin ze everything that Chu Su had said. ”

“Lin Ze sat on the sofa with a laptop on his lap. He pressed the keyboard with one hand. When he heard this, his expression was indifferent, but there was no special expression on his face. ”

“Then, he pressed the Enter Key. ”

He clicked save.

He closed the document.

No one knew if he had actually heard it.

“Brother Ze?”

“Yes.”Lin Ze closed the computer.

“Li Wen asked, “Brother Ze, what do you plan to do?” ”

“Go back.”

“”Go Back?”Li Wen, fat tiger, and dog two were stunned when they heard that. ”

“Lin Ze nodded. “We can’t let outsiders have the Lin family’s things! If I don’t go back, won’t I be in the heart of Feng Qianhua and her daughter?”They couldn’t wait for him to not go back! ”

He had to protect everything in the Lin family and protect the position that belonged to his mother.

Buttface nodded. “Brother Ze is right! We should go back! We can’t let that mother and daughter get away with it!”

The three of them sent Lin ze downstairs.

“When they arrived downstairs, they realized that old Mrs. Lin was here too. ”

“When she saw Lin Ze coming downstairs, old Mrs. Lin was so excited that she ran over and hugged Lin Ze, she cried, “Ah Ze, I’m sorry! Grandma wronged you. It’s Grandma’s fault! Grandma will never do this again! Can you forgive Grandma?” ”

Old Mrs. Lin was really regretful.

“Before she found Lin Ze, she was afraid that something would happen to him. ”

“Now that she saw Lin Ze, she could finally put down the huge burden in her heart. ”

Lin Ze didn’t say anything.

Old Mrs. Lin knew that Lin Ze was angry.

“The child had suffered so much, so it was natural for him to be angry. ”

“If it were anyone else, who wouldn’t be angry? ”

“”Ah Ze, I’m Sorry!”Old Mrs. Lin touched Lin Ze’s red and swollen face with trembling hands. “Does your face still hurt?” ”
