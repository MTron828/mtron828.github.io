Translator: 549690339

“I heard from Ziteng that master five will bring his girlfriend over today. I wonder if it’s true!”

“It must be a lie! I heard that master five never attends such gatherings.”

“”What if it’s true? After all, ziteng and master five have a good relationship. How can ziteng joke about such things?””

“Guess Who Master Five’s girlfriend is?”

“When these words were said, everyone looked at each other and saw the confusion in each other’s eyes.”

“A short-haired girl who looked very cute said, “I heard that Master Five’s girlfriend is the daughter that the Lin family has just recognized.””

The Lin family’s eldest daughter?

The reputation of the Lin family’s eldest daughter was not very good.

“When they heard this, the crowd immediately burst into laughter. “No way! You believe such fake news?””

“The short-haired girl continued, “I’m not spouting nonsense! I heard that master five went to the Lin family to meet his parents last time.””

“Another girl added, “Actually, I also heard that Master Five’s girlfriend is the Lin family’s eldest daughter. Moreover, eldest daughter Lin even beat song Chenyu in the car race last time.””

The eldest daughter of the Lin family could beat song Chenyu?

Was that possible? Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“”Don’t doubt it. In any case, the eldest daughter of the Lin family is a little different from the rumors. If fifth master really brings his girlfriend over today, you will be able to see it.””

“Upon hearing this, a sneer immediately sounded in the air. “Impossible, that’s impossible! You heard that Fifth Master’s girlfriend is the eldest daughter of the Lin family, then I also heard that Fifth Master’s girlfriend is Miss Song!””

“Song Chenyu was recognized as a great beauty in the entertainment industry, and Song Chenyu was also on good terms with Cen Yuyan.”

Anyone with a discerning eye could tell that Cen Yuyan had always treated song Chenyu as her own sister-in-law.

“If song Chenyu was Cen Shaoqing’s girlfriend, no one would be surprised.”

“Song Chenyu was known as a beauty that only appeared once in five thousand years, and the eldest daughter of the Lin family was known as what?”

A once-in-five-thousand-years idiot?

“At this moment, the sound of the door being pushed open came from outside.”

It was Cen Yuyan and song Chenyu.

“”Sister Yuyan, Miss Song.”Everyone stood up to greet the two of them.”

“Hello.”Cen Yuyan smiled at everyone and sat on the other side with song Chenyu.

“Although Cen Yuyan and song Chenyu were sitting on the other side, her gaze kept on a man in a suit.”

“The man’s facial features were outstanding, and the buttons of his shirt were meticulously tied to the top. Everyone was trying to please Cen Yuyan, but this man was indifferent, as if he did not see Cen Yuyan.”

“His eyes were on his nose, his nose was on his mouth, and his mouth was on his heart.”

In fact.

Cen Yuyan was here for him.

This man was called Lu Xiu.

“Lu Xiu was a scientific and technological talent. Although he was only 31 years old, he had already made a great breakthrough in the scientific and technological field. He had even been invited into the laboratory by H Nation.”

“When Cen Yuyan first met Lu Xiu, she was deeply attracted to him.”

“Although the two of them had only known each other for less than a month, CEN Yuyan had already reached the point where they had not seen each other for a day, and she was already thinking of him like crazy.”

“Even if she had to pursue him, she would still pursue Lu Xiu.”

“Unfortunately, Lu Xiu was different from other men.”

“Cen Yuyan had many boyfriends in the past. Those men, as long as they saw her money, they would be willing to pay for it, but Lu Xiu was not.”

Lu Xiu didn’t seem to be interested in anything.

“For Lu Xiu, Cen Yuyan even wanted to venture into the science and Technology World.”

“Unfortunately, she didn’t have a guide in the science and Technology World.”

“Therefore, after knowing that Lu Xiu had been invited by He ziteng as a guest, Cen Yuyan pulled song Chenyu over uninvited.”

“No matter what, she had to woo Lu Xiu!”

She wanted to become Lu Xiu’s girlfriend.

“After song Chenyu and Cen Yuyan arrived, the topic of conversation naturally returned to Song Chenyu.”

“In addition, he ziteng had said that fifth master Cen would bring his girlfriend over today, so everyone started to daydream.”

Could it be that Cen Shaoqing’s girlfriend was really song Chenyu?

“Then, someone asked tactfully, “Sister Yuyan, I heard that fifth master is coming over today, and he even brought his girlfriend along. I wonder if that’s true?””

Cen Yuyan’s face didn’t look too good when she mentioned the word ‘girlfriend’.

She didn’t know what was going on with Cen Shaoqing!

He actually still didn’t break up with ye Zao until now!

“If Cen Shaoqing was just playing around, he should have had enough of it after such a long time!”

Could it be that he really wanted to marry ye Zao?

Old Madam Cen was muddled with age.

Was he confused too?

“Although she was a little angry, Cen Yuyan still smiled. “I’m not too sure.””

“From what Cen Yuyan said, Song Chenyu did not seem to be Cen Wuye’s girlfriend?”
