Chapter 22: Moving Day

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

A chubby woman walked into the house and asked in puzzlement, “Ye Shu, did your family make a fortune? Did you win the lottery? How are you moving away so easily just like this?”

Ye Shu was supposed to be a mistress… Could it be that she had… returned to her former profession?

Otherwise, where did her money come from?

The chubby woman pondered over and over again.

However, Ye Shu solved her dilemma by looking over to Ye Zhuo with a smile. “It’s all Zhuo Zhuo’s contribution. The child is quite intelligent, and she managed to make some money from her stocks investment….”

Upon hearing that, the chubby woman said enviously, “Ye Shu! You raised a good daughter! If my Little Yue had your daughter’s capability, I bet our family would have moved out of here too!”

A daughter raised by a wealthy family was different from the rest here. It was expected if she were raised with good morals; however, this one was even capable of making money!

Upon saying that, the chubby woman looked toward Ye Zhuo and said, “Zhuo Zhuo, how did you make the investment, huh? Teach our Little Yue too at your convenience so that she can make some money and take us out of this damned place!”

The people around them immediately chimed in and said, “Teach our children too!”

Ye Zhuo smiled. “Investing in the stock market is just like a gamble. There are wins and losses. Some people lose so much that they became bankrupt too. I don’t have the qualifications to teach that, and I can’t guarantee that anyone will be profiting from it.”

Upon hearing that, the chubby woman’s expression changed at once.

‘Narrow-minded! She is too narrow-minded! She would not even agree to share a small amount of knowledge. She must have only made a small return, right? What was so impressive about that? She is just an illegitimate child! Had it not been her capability to make some money, who would even notice her? Who does she think she is? Does she really think that she is still the precious daughter of a wealthy family?’

The chubby woman feigned a smile on her face. “There’s a saying that a distant relative is not as helpful as a close neighbor. We have been neighbors for so many years... you won’t refuse to help us with this little favor, right? Oh Zhuo Zhuo, let’s make some money together!”

They had been neighbors for so many years, so what did Ye Zhuo have to lose from teaching her daughter?

Nonetheless, had it not been for Ye Zhuo’s ability to make money, she would have refused to pay any attention to an illegitimate daughter raised by a mistress!

Meanwhile, Ye Zhuo’s expression remained the same. “Madam, this is not an issue of whether I’m willing to teach or not, but it’s an issue of my not being able to guarantee if Little Yue can make money after I teach her….”

“If you can make a profit, then why can’t our Little Yue make a profit too? Our Little Yue doesn’t have any fewer limbs than you!” The chubby woman then said in an eccentric tone, “It’s fine if you don’t want to teach, but why do you have to come up with so many excuses!? I will just consider this experience as me finally seeing your true colors! Due to your hesitation, I believe that your money was not made from stock investments, but it is perhaps made in some dubious ways, right? In this entire neighborhood, who isn’t aware that your mother is a….”

Ye Zhuo’s interest was piqued. She lived two lives, yet it was still her first time meeting such a shameless person. However, she had never been a person who would do nothing when she was bullied.

She raised an eyebrow and looked at the chubby woman with a smile. Then, she enunciated her words clearly and interrupted the chubby woman by saying, “Madam, you’re right. I uh, I’m genuinely capable of making money. However, I’d rather teach the nobodies I meet by the roadside than teach your daughter, Little Yue!”

‘I refuse to do it!’

‘What can you do to me, huh!?’

Ye Zhuo did not have many hobbies, but she certainly enjoyed the feeling when others detested her yet were incapable of getting rid of her.

The chubby woman turned green with rage and pale with shock from being scolded. She was furious, yet there was nothing that she could do to refute either.

Meanwhile, Ye Zhuo felt like her entire body was at ease after saying everything that she wanted to say!

She felt high-spirited, and the air was serene where she was right now!

Unsurprisingly, Ye Shu was dumbstruck in astonishment from the side.

She saw Ye Zhuo as a rather gentle and quiet person all this time, so she figured that Ye Zhuo was a soft maiden; she certainly did not expect Ye Zhuo to be so ferocious! Even a person like the chubby woman in front of her was rendered speechless after being scolded by her.

One should know that the chubby woman was a renowned old shrew in the area. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

No one could triumph over her in an argument.

Ye Sen was also slightly stunned, but he reacted to the situation soon enough. He opened the door of the van and said, “Sis, Zhuo Zhuo, let’s go! Why do you have to talk nonsense with a person who can’t stand seeing others in a better place?”

Ye Zhuo nodded and helped Ye Shu to get into the car.

Gazing after the van disappearing into the streets, the chubby woman could finally react to the situation. She let out a ‘bah’ ferociously and said, “What the heck! You’re just a small woman intoxicated by success! Gross! You’re a bastard child that one wants! What a tramp!”

In the car, Ye Shu looked at Ye Zhuo. “We’ve all been neighbors for many years, and we meet each other day in and day out. What you did earlier was not very nice.”

“What’s not nice about that?” Ye Sen had his hands on the steering wheel as he chimed in, saying, “Why are you still being nice and kind to a two-faced person like Li Sanhua? I have wanted to scold her that way for some time! Sis, you’re too weak! Otherwise, back in those years….”

Li Sanhua was the chubby woman’s name.

At this point, Ye Sen seemed to have realized something, so he immediately changed the topic of conversation by saying, “Oh right, Zhuo Zhuo, shall I take a left turn at the next junction?”

“Mmhmm, you’re right.” Ye Zhuo nodded.

It did not take long before they arrived at the entrance of the housing area.

After living in a basement for so many years, Ye Shu was a little unaccustomed to moving into a three-bedroom house with adequate sunlight. She looked at the brand new furniture in the house and said, “Zhuo Zhuo, the rental for this house must be very expensive, right?”

Ye Zhuo replied, “It’s fine, it’s not very expensive. Oh right, please allow me to show you around the house. This is the dining room, this is the living room, and over here, we have the kitchen….”

“Zhuo Zhuo, which one is my room?” Ye Sen’s voice was heard coming from the inside.

“You can take whichever room you want,” answered Ye Zhuo.

Upon hearing that, Ye Sen chose the second bedroom. “I’ll take this room then.”

Ye Zhuo continued, “If uncle is taking the second bedroom, you should take the master bedroom, mom.”

“Zhuo Zhuo, it’s better for you to take the master bedroom! You’re a young woman while I’m old, so what’s the point of staying in the master bedroom?” Ye Shu declined.

Nevertheless, Ye Zhuo carried Ye Shu’s luggage to the master bedroom. “You’re taking the master bedroom, and it’s set! You’re not allowed to decline, or I’m going to be angry!”

“I can do nothing with you.” Ye Shu shook her head helplessly then said, “What would you like to have for lunch? I’ll cook for you.”

Ye Shu’s health was rapidly improving by the day. Other than her penchant for sleeping in during the morning, she was especially energetic at other times.

Ye Zhuo chuckled and said, “I’ll enjoy any food that my mother makes.”

They bought some ingredients on the way here, and the kitchen utensils in the house were all fully stocked, so it was very convenient to cook in the kitchen.

Ye Zhuo went to her room, turned on her laptop, put on her headphones, and logged on to the international website to begin the CIS database development project.

In truth, if the CIS project was in her other world, it should be done in less than three hours.

However, she was missing a lot of things now. Even though it was a simple task for Ye Zhuo, she still needed to spend two days or so to complete it.

The artificial intelligence in this world was too low of a standard that she would need to operate many programs manually.

Ye Zhuo managed to complete half of the design and keyed in some programs into it before Ye Shu informed her that lunch was ready from outside the door. “Zhuo Zhuo, it’s time for lunch.”

“Alright, coming over now,” answered Ye Zhuo. Then, she saved her completed work before she headed to the living room.

To celebrate the move today, Ye Shu had cooked braised pork in brown sauce and fish soup.

After lunch, Ye Zhuo returned to her room to work on the design again.

In the evening, Ye Zhuo headed to work in the barbecue shop.

Granny Cen was here again. She greeted Ye Zhuo in excitement upon seeing her.

“Ye Zi!”

“Granny Cen, you’re here.” Ye Zhuo walked over with a smile on her face and wrapped her arm around Granny Cen’s.

Granny Cen took a glance at Ye Zhuo. She realized that Ye Zhuo did not show any signs that she was uncomfortable whatsoever. It seemed that the young maiden was really not bothered by her being a beggar.

Granny Cen said, “Ye Zi, I’ve been waiting for you for a very long time! If you’re not here, they won’t even let me take a seat!”

Ye Zhuo brought Granny Cen to a table at the corner. “You must be starving after waiting for such a long time! What would you like to have? I’ll serve it to you.

Granny Cen rubbed her tummy. “I am really starving! Ye Zi! Can I have lobster noodles and deep-fried Hemiptera?”

“What’s a Hemiptera?” Ye Zhuo looked at Granny Cen in puzzlement.
