“Speaking up to this point, Zhou Jinbei continued, “Why did Xie Wanqiu appear at our house? And Why? After Xie wanqiu came to our house, something happened to our mother!” ”

“Zhou Xiang narrowed her eyes. “Jinbei, if I remember correctly, uncle Feng is addicted to alcohol and often goes crazy from it. I don’t think I can believe everything he says, right?” ”

“Uncle Feng was the son-in-law of his wife. Perhaps he did not have a good life at his wife’s house, so he liked to drink a lot. Whenever he saw him, he would always look drunk. ”

How much credibility could a drunkard’s words have?

“Perhaps it was because he had never experienced betrayal. After marrying Cen Haifeng, Cen Haifeng had always been obedient to her. It made Zhou Xiang feel that no husband in this world would betray his wife. ”

Especially a husband and wife who were as loving as Zhou Zuolong and Wu Lan.

“When Wu Lan was still alive, she had told Zhou Xiang about her past with Zhou Zuolong. ”

“Hearing this, Zhou Jinbei frowned tightly. ”

“”Not only uncle Feng, but other people also said the same thing,”Zhou Jinbei continued, “I’ve traveled all over the world for so many years and heard a lot of rumors about Xie Wanqiu and Zhou Zuolong. There’s no smoke without fire. If they’re really fine, will they leave a trail for others?” ”

“If Zhou Zuolong and Xie wanqiu were really innocent, would the rumors outside be so true? ”

It was impossible!

“Therefore, Zhou Jinbei never believed that those rumors were rumors. ”

“However, Zhou Xiang didn’t think so. ”

“In her opinion, rumors were rumors. ”

“After all, when they first met ye Zao in Cloud Capital, everyone didn’t have a good impression of him. ”

“Idiot, Trash, ugly girl, almost became ye Zao’s exclusive label. ”

But was ye Zao really like that?

Not at all!

“Not only was ye Zao not like the rumors, but he was also very outstanding. From this, it could be seen that sometimes, rumors were like waves without wind, and black and white were reversed. ”

“Hearing was false, seeing was believing. ”

“Zhou Xiang raised her head and looked at Zhou Jinbei, then, she said, “When entering north, disaster comes from the mouth. At that time, we were still young. Everything you know today is just hearsay. Father has been in business for so many years, and there are many people who are envious of him. What if those people want to sow discord?” ”

“When a person reached a certain level, they would be envious and jealous. ”

“The Zhou family’s business was very big, and Zhou Jinbei was a wealthy and influential person. She was the mistress of the Cen family, and the Zhou family was an illustrious family in the local area. ”

It was very normal for people to slander someone when they were in an illustrious position.

“At this point, Zhou Xiang sighed, “A tree wants peace, but the wind won’t stop. A child wants to be nurtured, but the family won’t stay. “Mom left early. We only have one father left. He’s already in his seventies this year. How many more years do you think he can live? Ten years? Twenty years? “I hope that in the next few days, you won’t do anything to hurt dad and make yourself regret it.” ”

“Wu Lan left too early. If it wasn’t for the photo, Zhou Xiang almost couldn’t remember her appearance. ”

The reason why Zhou Xiang treated Zhou Zuolong and Xie wanqiu so well was actually to make up for the regret of not being able to show filial piety to Wu Lan.

She only had one father. She really could not do anything to harm Zhou Zuolong.

“Speaking up to this point, Zhou Xiang paused, then, she said, “Jinbei, although Xie Wanqiu is not our biological mother, she has been in our family for so many years. She has watched us grow up. In the coming days, even if you can’t treat her as your biological mother, at least don’t hate her so much. “Let go of your opinions. Isn’t it good to have a harmonious family?” ”

Harmony begets wealth.

A harmonious family begets prosperity.

These ancient sayings would never go wrong.

Zhou Xiang did not want to see a father without a father and a son without a son.

“Although Xie Wanqiu did not treat them well when they were young, she was very good to Zhou Zuolong. ”

“Thirty years, nearly forty years. Even if there was no merit, there was hard work. ”

“Zhou Xiang really wanted to see Zhou Jinbei let go of his prejudice against Xie Wanqiu and become a real family, a family reunion. ”

“”Sister, don’t you care at all about the cause of our mother’s death? Don’t you want to clear her name? Don’t you want to seek justice for her? That’s our biological mother! Xie wanqiu, who does Xie Wanqiu think she is?”Zhou Jinbei’s eyes were slightly red, “If our mother found out that you were so kind to the person who killed our mother underground, she would definitely be heartbroken!” ” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The person who killed our mother?

“Zhou Xiang’s entire body trembled when she heard this, and her scalp went numb. ”

“”Jinbei, you can’t prove it with your words. The police still need to pay attention to evidence to convict her. You’ve always said that our mother’s death had something to do with Xie wanqiu. Do you have any evidence?” ”
