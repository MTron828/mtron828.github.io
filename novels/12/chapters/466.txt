“After saying that, ye Zao continued, “What’s wrong with Your Voice?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing coughed lightly and said seriously, “Maybe you caught a cold last night.” ”

“”Let me take a look.”After saying that, Ye Zao reached out his hand to check CEN Shaoqing’s pulse. ”

“Cen Shaoqing held ye Zao’s hand back and his deep voice seemed to have become even more hoarse. “No need. My resistance is very good. I’ll be fine after a night.”At worst, he could just wake up tomorrow morning and wash the bed sheets. ”

It was not his first time anyway.

Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Alright then. You can call me if there’s anything.”

Call me if there’s anything?

He really wanted to call.

But he did not have the guts to do so.

CEN Shaoqing’s gaze swept across ye Zao’s face and an unnatural expression flashed across his eyes. “Then I’ll go back first. Rest early tonight.”

Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“After sending Cen Shaoqing out of the apartment building and watching the black car disappear into the night sky, ye Zao turned around and entered the house. ”

Cen Shaoqing turned the temperature in the car to the lowest level and took out a bottle of ice mineral water from the car’s refrigerator. He held the steering wheel with one hand and unscrewed the bottle cap with one hand.

Gulp Gulp Gulp —

His sexy Adam’s apple started to slide up and down.

Only when the ice-cold mineral water entered his throat did the dryness in his body subside a little.

He looked out of the window.

He suddenly felt a little emotional.

“He had never thought that he would have such a secular, impulsive, and embarrassing time. ”

“In the past, he always thought that he was different from others. ”

“His life had never been for the sake of getting a wife, having children, and having children! ”

Now.

He felt that the greatest meaning of existing in this world was to be with her and nurture the crystallization of their love together.

As he thought of this.

The corners of Cen Shaoqing’s mouth curled into a faint smile.

“After a short while, he arrived at the Cen House. ”

Cen Shaoqing took out the gift that ye Zao had meticulously prepared for him from the trunk.

Just as he entered the house.

“Old Madam Cen appeared in front of Cen Shaoqing with one hand on her waist. “Brat, how is it? Grandmother’s new clothes are not bad, right?” ”

“They are indeed not bad.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

Old Mrs. Cen glanced at Cen Shaoqing. “It’s a pity that you didn’t.”

“Cen Shaoqing did not mind at all. “Grandmother, if there’s nothing else, I’ll go back to my room first.” ”

“”Wait.”Old Mrs. Cen stopped Cen Shaoqing and said suspiciously, “Rascal, stop pretending. Speak! Are you very jealous of Grandmother Now?” ”

“Ye Zhuo had prepared gifts for the entire family, but Cen Shaoqing was not one of them. ”

Cen Shaoqing must be feeling very uncomfortable now.

It made him so arrogant in the past.

“Cen Shaoqing was feeling very uncomfortable now, and Old Madam Cen was very happy now! ”

She even wanted to sing a song.

“”No, you’re imagining too much.”Cen Shaoqing’s tone was indifferent. ”

Old Madam Cen narrowed her eyes. “It shouldn’t be! Could it be that Yezi has also prepared a gift for you?”

Cen Shaoqing waved the rectangular box in his hand.

“No Wonder.”Old Mrs. Cen snorted lightly.

She didn’t get to watch the show and was almost stuffed with dog food. Old Mrs. Cen had no choice but to let Cen Shaoqing return to his room.

“After Cen Shaoqing returned to his room, the first thing he did was to open the package. ” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

It was a top-grade Hetian white jade tea set.

It was full of color.

One look and one could tell that it was carefully selected.

Cen Shaoqing immediately went to the tea awner.

“He was worried that the servant would break the tea set, so Cen Shaoqing personally did it. He was very careful throughout the entire process, afraid that he would break the tea set. ”

...

On the other side.

Cen Yuyan came to Song Chenyu’s house.

“Song Chenyu had already finished showering. At this moment, she was really wearing her pajamas and applying a facial mask. ”

She was in a very good state when she was not wearing makeup.

“Chenyu.”Cen Yuyan gave song Chenyu a big hug the moment she entered.

“What’s Wrong?”Song Chenyu patted Cen Yuyan’s back.

Cen Yuyan talked about the gift that ye Zao gave her today.

“”Chenyu, do you know how regretful I am now? I was too impulsive at that time! I shouldn’t have been so impulsive! That is Zy’s new product with a limited edition of 10 pieces! Do you think I’m Stupid?” ”

Cen Yuyan’s heart throbbed with pain at the mention of this matter.

Song Chenyu did not expect Cen Yuyan to throw away the gift ye Zhuo gave her. There was some surprise between his brows. “Do your three sisters and master five know about this matter?”

Cen Yuyan shook her head. “I didn’t dare to tell them.”

“The three sisters at home, grandmother, and mother all liked ye Zhuo very much. ”

“If they knew about this, she would definitely suffer! ”

“Song Chenyu nodded. “Don’t tell them about this. However, Yuyan, you’re a little impulsive when you do things. No matter what, you can’t throw away the present miss ye gave you.” ”
