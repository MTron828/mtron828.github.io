“To Xu Yao, her mother was worrying over nothing. ”

She was annoyed by her nagging.

“Mother Xu smiled and said, “Okay, okay, okay. As long as you know what you’re doing.”Maybe she was really worrying over nothing. After all, Xu Yao was so capable. ” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Now, who in her family didn’t Envy Xu Yao? ”

They were all counting on Xu Yao to build a bridge and pave the way for their sisters after she married into a wealthy family!

“After saying that, mother Xu continued, “Come down after you’re done applying your lipstick. I’ll go down first.” ”

“Okay.”Xu Yao nodded.

“Soon, mother Xu came downstairs. ”

“”Little he, Yaoyao is still changing. Please wait for a while and chat with your uncle. Don’t be anxious.” ”

“He ziteng smiled and said, “Aunty, you’re too polite. You said it wasn’t troublesome. I’m Yaoyao’s boyfriend. These are all things that I should do.” ”

“Mother Xu said, “Little He, you’re really a good child. Our Yaoyao has finally found the right person.” ”

He ziteng felt a little embarrassed after being praised.

“At this moment, footsteps sounded outside the door. Following that, the voice of a servant was heard, “Eldest miss.” ”

“In this family, the person who was called eldest miss was naturally Xu Chaonan. ”

“As expected, the next second, Xu Chaonan walked in from outside the door. ”

“When he saw Xu Chaonan, he ziteng immediately stood up from the sofa and greeted politely, “Aunt.” ”

“Xu Chaonan did not have much expression on his face, nor was he as attentive as his brother and sister-in-law. He only nodded at he ziteng and then strode upstairs. ”

“When she saw this scene, mother Xu frowned. ”

This Xu Chaonan was really too much!

She was clearly throwing a tantrum for he ziteng to see.

She was jealous that Xu Yao found such a good boyfriend and wanted to ruin this good marriage.

It was really too disgusting!

How could there be such an aunt in the world?

Mother Xu was very angry and wanted to rush up and give he chaonan a slap.

Father Xu was also a little angry.

He ziteng was the future son-in-law of the Xu family after all. What did Xu Chaonan mean by this?

Should he be more enthusiastic towards he ziteng?

He really didn’t act like an aunt at all.

“Father Xu poured a cup of tea for he ziteng and said with a smile, “Little He, don’t mind her. My Sister, Yaoyao’s aunt, has always been like this. She treats everyone like this. She’s not targeting you.” ”

“”I know, Uncle.”He ziteng nodded. ”

Xu Chaonan walked all the way upstairs and happened to bump into Xu Yao who was walking downstairs.

“Xu Yao had always been a sweet-talker. When she saw Xu Chaonan, she immediately smiled and said, “Auntie is back.” ”

“”Mm.”Xu Chaonan nodded. He didn’t want to say anything, but after thinking for a while, he still said, “Yaoyao.” ”

“”What’s wrong, Auntie?”Xu Yao turned to look at Xu Chaonan. ”

“Xu Chaonan continued, “I’m your Auntie, and you’re my biological niece. So, I’m going to ask one more question today. Are you and he ziteng serious?” ”

“Yes.”Xu Yao nodded.

“Xu Chaonan looked at Xu Yao and continued, “Since it’s serious, I hope you can treat this relationship well. Love is most afraid of lies and deceit.” ”

There were some things that could not be said.

Xu Yao understood what she meant.

“In this relationship, Xu Chaonan only saw Xu Yao’s schemes against he ziteng. ”

“There was no love, nor did she like him. ”

But paper could not contain fire.

A marriage that relied on schemes would never be happy.

“As an aunt, Xu Chaonan did not want to see his niece regret. ”

“Xu Yao looked at Xu Chaonan and smiled, “Aunt, don’t worry. I understand what you’re saying.” ”

“Actually, Xu Yao could see through Xu Chaonan’s thoughts. ”

His mother was right.

Xu Chaonan was jealous of her.

He was jealous that she could marry he ziteng.

“Once she married he ziteng, the Xu family’s status would rise like bamboo shoots after a rain. As for Xu Chaonan, he would naturally become an unimportant person. ”

How could Xu Chaonan not be worried?

“If it wasn’t for the fact that the Xu family couldn’t leave Xu Chaonan’s help for the time being, she would have torn off Xu Chaonan’s mask with her own hands long ago. ”

Unfortunately.

She couldn’t do it now.

“Xu Chaonan nodded and patted Xu Yao on the shoulder, then said, “It’s good that you know what to do.” ”

“Xu Yao continued, “Aunt, I’ll be going down first. I’m going to watch a movie with Ziteng later.” ”

“”You go ahead,”Xu Chaonan said. ”

Xu Yao turned around and went downstairs.

“Seeing Xu Yao leave, Xu Chaonan narrowed his eyes. ”

Xu Yao went downstairs. “Ziteng.”

“Yaoyao.”He ziteng stood up.

“Xu Yao looked at her parents. “Dad, Mom, the movie is about to start. We’ll be leaving first.” ”

“”Okay, you guys go ahead. Little He, drive slowly on the road.” ”

“He ziteng nodded. “I know, uncle and Auntie.” ”

Xu Yao followed he ziteng to the parking lot.

“After getting into the passenger seat, Xu Yao turned to look at he ziteng. “Do you know why I made you wait for so long?” ”

“Why?”He ziteng asked.

“Xu Yao said, “Because I’m testing you.” ”

This was the point of ‘doing’. Xu Yao directly told he ziteng her purpose. The effect was much better than he ziteng’s own guess.

“Test what?”He ziteng asked.

“Xu Yao smiled and said, “Of course it’s to test your patience! If you don’t even have the patience to wait for your girlfriend to put on makeup and go out, then why would I keep you as my boyfriend? To celebrate the New Year?” ”

“He ziteng laughed out loud. “You’re right. So, have I passed my test?” ”

Xu Yao’s guess was very right.

He ziteng really liked Xu Yao who would occasionally ‘Act’.

That was because all the girlfriends he had met before were overly gentle and considerate.

“Whatever he said was true. They had never had their own thoughts, just like a tool person. ”

Xu Yao was very different from them.

“Xu Yao had her own thoughts, and she would not give in to her. She would eat whatever she wanted to eat, and she would not hide anything from herself. ”

He ziteng liked Xu Yao very much.

“”Just barely,”Xu Yao continued, “It would be even better if my mom did not rush me upstairs.” ”

“He ziteng held the steering wheel with both hands. “I’m Innocent! I did not let Auntie go up. I even stopped Auntie, but Auntie insisted on rushing you. It has nothing to do with me.” ”

“Is that so?”Xu Yao asked.

“”Of course it is.”He ziteng continued, “By the way, does your aunt not approve of me?” ”

“Every time he ziteng went to the Xu family’s house, Xu Chaonan would act the same. ”

“Xu Yao said, “My aunt is like that. You Don’t have to worry about her.” ”

“”Yes.”He ziteng nodded. “By the way, I have something to tell you.” ”

“”Go ahead,”Xu Yao said. ”

“He ziteng continued, “Are you free tomorrow morning?” ”

Go Up Tomorrow?

He ziteng asked if she was free...

What did he ziteng mean?

Was he taking her home to meet her parents?

“Xu Yao narrowed her eyes and continued, “There seems to be a class reunion. Why?” ”

“There’s a class reunion?”He ziteng frowned.

“”Yes.”Xu Yao nodded and continued, “Do you have anything else?” ”

“He ziteng continued, “I originally wanted to bring you home to meet my parents. After all, we’ve been together for such a long time. I’ve already met your parents!” ”

“”Oh, that’s what you’re talking about. Then I’ll go home with you tomorrow morning to meet my parents,”Xu Yao said. ”

“He ziteng turned to look at Xu Yao and continued, “But don’t you have a class reunion tomorrow?” ”

“Xu Yao said, “Meeting my parents is a big deal. How can I miss the opportunity to wish uncle and Auntie a happy new year just for the sake of a class reunion? This is a form of disrespect to uncle.” ”

Xu Yao’s words were grand and dignified. He ziteng was also very satisfied. He did not see Xu Yao’s impatience at all.

“He ziteng had always liked Xu Yao. At this moment, he felt that Xu Yao understood the bigger picture and was a good girl. ”

“At this moment, Xu Yao’s worried voice sounded, “Ziteng, will uncle and Auntie not like me?” ”

“”They won’t.”He ziteng smiled and said, “My parents are very easy to get along with. You are so gentle, kind, and understanding. My parents will definitely like you very much!” ”

“Hearing this, Xu Yao’s face flushed red. She said somewhat embarrassedly, “Really?” ”

“Of course it’s true!”He ziteng nodded.

“Xu Yao continued, “By the way, I still don’t know what uncle and Auntie like. I’m going to wish them a happy new year tomorrow. What should I bring?” ”

“He ziteng said, “You don’t have to bring anything. As long as you go, my parents will be very happy.” ”

“”That’s not good, right?”Xu Yao asked. ”

“He ziteng smiled and said, “I’m serious. My parents have long wanted to have grandchildren. If you go, the two of them will definitely be very happy!” ”

On the other side.

At the Cen family manor.

Ye Zhuo woke up from his sleep with a very tired look on his face.

Cen Shaoqing immediately handed him a glass of water. “How is it? Did you see anything this time?”

Ye Zhuo took the water and took a sip. The look in his eyes gradually returned to clarity. “I saw it.”

She saw a lot of memories of the past.

“However, it was mixed up with the memories of the present and was a little messy. She needed time to sort it out. ”

“After a while, Ye Zhuo slightly raised his eyes and looked at Cen Shaoqing, then he said, “The world I used to live in was called Changyue Country.” ”
