What about this time?

Was It...

Ye Zhuo?

How could it be possible!

How could song Shiyu hit her for Ye Zhuo?

It couldn’t be!

It couldn’t be!

It couldn’t be!

“”Let me ask you, who told you to bully her?”Song Shiyu increased the strength in his hands and grabbed song Chenyu’s hair. Because he used too much strength, his joints had turned slightly white. ”

Who Was ‘she’?

Was It Ye Zhuo?

“Who told you to bully her! ?”

“”I didn’t bully Miss Ye. Third Brother, you’ve misunderstood me...”song Chenyu said with red eyes. ”

“At this moment, Song Chenyu looked like a different person. ”

“In the next second, he let go of Song Chenyu’s hair. ”

“Before song Chenyu could let out a sigh of relief, her neck was suddenly grabbed by someone and gradually tightened. Song Chenyu only felt that his feet were getting farther and farther away from the ground. ”

A sense of fear of death surrounded song Chenyu.

Song Chenyu was truly afraid.

She had never experienced death so close to her.

It was as if she would die in the next second.

“Due to the lack of oxygen, song Chenyu’s face was flushed red. He could not say a word and his feet were flailing in the air. ”

“Seeing song Chenyu in pain, Song Shiyu slowly curled his lips. His eyes were actually filled with excitement. ”

“Seeing that song Chenyu was about to die in the next second, song Shiyu slowly said, enunciating each word, “If you dare to bully her again in the future, I’ll Take Your Life!” ”

“As he finished speaking, he slowly released his fingers. ” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Bang!

“Song Chenyu was thrown to the ground, breathing in large mouthfuls of air. His face was filled with the ecstasy of having escaped death. ”

“For a second just now, she really thought that she was going to die. ”

It was alright.

It was alright.

She was not dead.

Song Shiyu picked up the microphone on his desk. “Call two security guards in.”

“Very soon, the security guards arrived. ”

“Boss.”

“Song Shiyu pointed at song Chenyu who was on the ground and said, “Throw her out.” ”

“Okay.”

Song Chenyu was carried away by two security guards.

Song Shiyu let Secretary Yang in again.

Secretary Yang happened to see song Chenyu being carried out by two security guards when he went in. He frowned slightly and could not react in time.

“A moment later, he knocked on the door and entered. “Boss, you were looking for me?” ”

“Song Shiyu washed his hands with the hand sanitizer in a serious manner. Then, he wiped his hands with a handkerchief and threw the handkerchief into the trash can. Only then did he look up at Secretary Yang. “Take care of Song Chenyu.” ”

Take care of Song Chenyu?

“Just as secretary Yang had not completely digested these words, song Shiyu continued, “Oh, that’s not right. He should be called Zhou Chenyu now.” ”

Zhou Chenyu?

Secretary Yang gulped. was song Shiyu trying to clean up the family and drive song Chenyu out of the song family?

“Song Shiyu continued, “Let Zhou Chenyu go back to where he came from.” ”

“Secretary Yang was stunned for a moment and immediately nodded. “Yes, Boss.” ”

“Until he came out of the office, Secretary Yang did not know how song Chenyu had offended song Shiyu. ”

But it was normal.

“After all, Song Shiyu’s personality was unpredictable. ”

“Moreover, Song Shiyu and song Shiyu were not really brother and sister. ”

Secretary Yang immediately went to handle song Shiyu’s matter.

“The moment song Shiyu was thrown out of the office, she knew that she was finished. ”

She never dreamed that one day song Shiyu would be so ruthless to her sister because of Ye Zhuo.

“At that moment, Song Chenyu’s phone rang. Song Chenyu took out his phone and pressed the answer button. ”

“Brother Tao’s furious voice came from the other end of the screen. “Song Chenyu! What have you done, you idiot? Didn’t you say that song Shiyu is your brother? Then why did song Shi Group suddenly withdraw their investment?” ”

Withdraw their investment?

Song Shiyu actually withdrew his investment?

“Brother Tao continued, “Come to the company right away!” ”

“That afternoon, many luxury brands and song Chenyu’s cancellations were posted on Weibo, and Song Chenyu and the entertainment company’s cancellations were trending. ”

“Under song Chenyu’s Weibo comments, there were all comments that told her to get out of the entertainment industry. ”

“But in the blink of an eye, song Chenyu had become a rat on the street, and everyone was shouting at her. ”

“Cen Yuyan sat on the sofa and looked at Weibo, which had been paralyzed several times. The corners of her mouth curled up slightly. ”

She finally saw that song Chenyu had gotten his comeuppance!

“In the next second, Cen Yuyan scrolled to two new hot searches. ”
