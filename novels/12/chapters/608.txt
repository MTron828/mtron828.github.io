“Chapter 609: 146: a strong slap to the face. This is my boyfriend, Cen Shaoqing. Feng Xianxian was dumbfounded! 3”

“Upon hearing this, Old Madam Jiang’s face was full of smiles. “Good, good, good! That’s Good!”She used to think that this second daughter of hers was the most useless in the family. She did not expect that Jiang Suran’s luck would also turn for the better one day. ”

That was the Lin Family!

“Although the fourth son of the Lin family did not do much in the country, he was able to enter the top 30 of the rich list overseas. ”

“Moreover, the Lin family had many brothers and had influence in all parts of the country. As the saying went, it was easy to get things done with people. If Jiang Suran could marry into the Lin family as she wished, it would be a great thing! ”

“At that time, the Jiang family could also benefit from it. ”

“After saying that, old madam Jiang seemed to have suddenly remembered something and asked with a straight face, “Are you still with that side?” ”

“”Don’t worry, it’s long been broken off.” ”

“”Really?”Old Madam Jiang narrowed her eyes. “Let me tell you, don’t make a mistake at such a critical time!” ”

It was Jiang Suran’s fortune to be able to marry into the Lin family. Old Madam Jiang didn’t want Jiang Suran to make a mistake at such a time.

“”Mom!”Jiang Suran said somewhat speechlessly, “Look at what you’re saying! Am I the kind of person who doesn’t know what’s important and what’s Not?” ”

“It’s good that you know it in your heart.”Old Madam Jiang glanced at Jiang Su ran.

Jiang su ran held old madam Jiang’s arm. “I’ll help you back to your room first.”

Feng Qianhua didn’t return to the Feng family immediately.

“Instead, she came to the Lin family home. ”

“Old Madam Lin wasn’t surprised to see Feng Qianhua return. She stood up and said, “Qianhua is here!” ”

“Feng Qianhua walked over with a smile. “Aunt Lin, you’ve met Su ran today. What do you think of her?” ”

“Old Madam Lin said, “She’s quite a nice person! She knows the rules and knows the cold and warmth. When Qing Xuan comes back, I’ll talk to her about this matter and try to settle things as soon as possible.” ”

“Feng Qianhua nodded. “Alright, I’m relieved to hear that from you.” ”

“Old Madam Lin held Feng Qianhua’s hand. “Qianhua, it’s all thanks to you this time! If it weren’t for you, where would I have found such a good girl?”Old Madam Lin was really very pleased with Su ran. ”

“Feng Qianhua smiled and said, “Look at what you’re saying. As the saying goes, it’s not like a family doesn’t enter the same house. For you to like Su ran, it means that the two of you have an affinity with each other.” ”

“When she said the words ‘affinity with each other’, a gloomy look flashed across Feng Qianhua’s eyes. ”

“Old Madam Lin patted her hand. “Qianhua, don’t worry. You’ve always been the best daughter-in-law in my heart. As long as there’s a chance, I’ll chase that Shameless B * Tch, Ye Shu, out of the Lin family.” ”

“Feng Qianhua smiled. “Aunt Lin, don’t say that. So much time has passed, and I’ve thought it through. As long as I can see brother Jin Cheng Happy, then I’ll be happy.” ”

“Seeing Feng Qianhua like this, Old Madam Lin Sighed. ”

“At night, when Lin Qingxuan returned from outside, Old Madam Lin brought up the old matters again and talked about Jiang Sulan. ”

“Hearing this, Lin Qingxuan pinched her temples and said tiredly, “Mom, didn’t I say it a few days ago? I Won’t think about these things for a while.” ”

“”Mom is already so old. She might leave one day.”At this point, Old Lady Lin’s eyes were red. “Can’t you let mom leave before she dies without any worries?” ”

“”Twenty-one years ago, mom already made a mistake. Can’t you give mom a chance to make up for it? Qingxuan, don’t worry. Su ran will definitely be a good wife and mother in the future!” ”

“”Mom, the best way for you to make up to me now is not to talk about this anymore!”Lin Qingxuan continued, “I’m an adult now. I know what to do with my own matters! The most important thing for you now is to retire peacefully!” ”

Old Lady Lin looked at Lin Qingxuan with disbelief in her eyes. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Did Lin Qingxuan blame him for being a busybody?

“But if Lin Qingxuan wasn’t her son, who would be willing to care for him? Who wouldn’t want to retire peacefully? ”

“It was said that it was difficult to manage a family of ten people, and there were dozens of people in the Lin family. If it wasn’t for her supporting them all these years, they would have been in chaos long ago! ”

It was fine if Lin Qingxuan didn’t know about her hard work.

“But now, she was blaming her for being nosy. ”

This really made Old Lady Lin’s heart turn cold.

Old Lady Lin’s heart was filled with anger. She could not get it out and she could not get it out. It was stuck in her throat and she felt very uncomfortable.

“After Lin Qingxuan left, Aunt Zhang comforted old lady lin, “Old Lady, Qingxuan just divorced Secretary Zhao. It’s normal for him to be unable to accept Jiang Suran for a while. Why Don’t you give him a little more time?” ”
