Who is he?

“L had been out of the hacker world for many years, but he had been keeping an eye on the hacker world all these years. ”

“As far as he knew, this year, the only new blood in the hacker World Was Z. ”

“So, was this person Z? ”

L narrowed his eyes.

“At this moment, the computer that was originally bright suddenly turned black. ”

L quickly pressed the shortcut key.

Unfortunately.

He was still a step too late.

A moment later.

Two words slowly appeared on the computer screen —

Brother!

“As a C citizen, L naturally couldn’t recognize the words that had been crossed out. ”

But he subconsciously felt that these two words were somewhat familiar.

“L took out his cell phone, took a picture of the words on the computer screen, and sent it to a friend. ”

Selead branch.

Ye Zao slowly pressed the Enter Key.

The hack was successful!

Ye Zao looked back at the Deputy Executive Officer. “Go and inform everyone that all the computers are ready to use.”

“The deputy executive officer was stunned at first, and then said in disbelief, “Really?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“When Adar heard this, his face was full of disbelief. ”

“Even if ye Zao wanted to brag, he wouldn’t do so. ”

How long has it been?

Half an hour!

“Putting aside whether ye Zao had the ability to defeat L. , even if she really had the ability, she wouldn’t be able to defeat L. in half an hour! Restore the system! ”

“The deputy executive officer continued, “Then I’ll go and inform everyone now!” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Before the deputy executive officer could inform him, Chris ran over breathlessly. “It’s working! It’s working! Our computers are working!” ”

“At this moment, Smith also reacted. “Are you sure?” ”

“Yes!”

“Smith said excitedly, “That’s great!”Then he turned to look at Ye Zhuo. “Miss Ye, thank you!” ”

“”You’re welcome.”Ye Zhuo continued, “In addition, I have installed a security defense system on this main computer. If there is any hacking next time, this software will automatically intercept it. I have already recorded the account and password in my notebook.” ”

“Okay.”Smith nodded.

Polly’s face turned pale.

That won’t happen.

How could it be!

How could ye Zao defeat L. ! !

That Was L.

“Facing L. , he didn’t even have the ability to fight back. ” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Moreover, Ye Zao was a Chinese. ”

Coincidence.

It must be a coincidence.

“Otherwise, L decided to stop at the last minute and let ye Zao take advantage of him. ”

“If he could hold on until now, he would not let ye Zao take advantage of him. ”

Polly was feeling very uncomfortable now.

He had mixed feelings.

“Bai Xiaosu smiled and turned around. “Mr. Polly, don’t you think that our Miss Ye has taken advantage of you again?” ”

“Polly was in a difficult situation and could not speak. He only hated himself for not holding on for a few more minutes. He smiled and said, “Team leader Bai, you misunderstood me. I didn’t mean it that way.” ”

“This time, he admitted defeat. ”

“Hearing these words, Adar’s face turned pale. ”

He did not expect this to happen.

“He had originally been waiting to see ye Zao make a fool of himself. Unexpectedly, he had brought disgrace upon himself and let others see their joke. ”

...

“After leaving the Selead branch, Ye Zao strolled along the streets of C Nation. ”

“At this moment, the sound of footsteps could be heard, followed by an incredulous voice, “Ye Zao?” ”

Ye Zhuo looked back slightly and saw a figure dressed in a black suit.

“His features were handsome, and his temperament was relaxed. ”

This was...

Song Shiyu.

“Brother Song.”Ye Zhuo was still very surprised to see song Shiyu on the streets of C Nation.

“Song Shiyu smiled and said, “I didn’t expect to see you here.” ”

“”I didn’t expect it either,”ye Zhuo continued, “Brother song, are you here on Business?” ”

“Yes.”Song Shiyu nodded slightly.

The assistant behind him was stunned.

Why didn’t he know that their boss was here on business?

“As soon as he finished speaking, song Shiyu continued, “Have you eaten? I know a restaurant nearby that requires a card to come to C nation. It’s rare for us to meet in C nation, so I’ll treat you to a meal.” ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “If I remember correctly, I still owe you a meal! No matter what, I have to treat you to this meal.” ”

“”If that’s the case, then I won’t stand on ceremony.”After saying that, song Shiyu looked at his assistant. “Go and drive the car over.” ”

“”Yes, Boss.”The assistant nodded. ”

“Soon, the assistant drove the car over. ”

Song Shiyu opened the car door for ye Zhuo in a gentlemanly manner.

Ye Zhuo leaned into the car.

“Soon after, Song Shiyu also sat in the car. ”

“The weather in C Nation was very good. The warm sun was shining brightly, and the spring breeze was warm. Ye Zhuo opened the car window, and the breeze poured in from the outside. ”
