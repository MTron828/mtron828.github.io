“Chapter 1388: 286: if he’s not afraid of losing face, What Am I afraid of? 1”

Translator: 549690339

Zhou Zuolong was very angry.

“Although Zhou Jinbei was his son, his character was not like him at all. He was unfaithful and unfilial. When he was a teenager, he was very angry and made news that he ran away from home. The outside world almost spread the rumor that he and Xie wanqiu abused their young son.”

Xie Wanqiu’s reputation was ruined at that time.

“But even so, Xie Wanqiu did not blame Zhou Jinbei. She even personally helped to find Zhou Jinbei.”

What about Zhou Jinbei?

What did Zhou Jinbei Do?

“He was the same as Zhou Xiang. He had no gratitude at all. Xie wanqiu was so good to him, but Zhou Jinbei did not even want to call her mother.”

“Not only did he not want to call her mother, but usually, when Zhou Jinbei saw Xie wanqiu, he did not even have a smile on his face.”

How many sons in the world were like Zhou Jinbei?

“It was true that dragons gave birth to dragons, Phoenixes gave birth to Phoenixes, and rats’sons knew how to dig holes.”

“Wu Lan herself was not a good person, and giving birth to a son was not a good person either.”

Zhou Jinbei’s personality was very similar to Wu Lan’s.

“This unfilial son would be like Wu Lan sooner or later, and he would have to be a short-lived ghost.”

“Seeing Zhou Zuolong like this, Xie wanqiu continued, “Old man, don’t be in a hurry to get angry. Maybe it’s because we’ve just arrived in the capital and haven’t found a place to stay yet.””

“”What place to stay?”Zhou zuolong said, “Isn’t his sister Zhou Xiang in Beijing? He just doesn’t want to visit us on purpose! I’ve long seen that he’s an ungrateful wretch. Wanqiu, you don’t have to speak up for him.””

“At the end of the day, Zhou Jinbei just didn’t take these parents to heart.”

UNFILIAL things!

“It was fine if he didn’t come to visit them during the holidays, but now that he had come to Beijing and found out that they were in the hospital, he didn’t even know to come and see them!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Which family’s son would be like Zhou Jinbei?

“Xie wanqiu said with understanding, “You can’t put it that way. Maybe Jinbei doesn’t know that I’m in the hospital. Those who don’t know are not guilty.””

“”Don’t Know?”Zhou Zuolong sneered and said angrily, “As long as you have this filial piety, what is there that you don’t Know?””

“”Maybe Jinbei is busy,”Xie wanqiu continued, “Old Man, you are good at everything, but you are too impatient. “It’s not a big deal. As a parent, why bother with your own child?””

“Although Xie Wanqiu looked like she was speaking up for Zhou Jinbei, she was actually adding fuel to the fire.”

The fire in Zhou Zuolong’s heart burned brighter and brighter. He wished he could just slap Zhou Jinbei to death.

Unfilial Son!

“”Busy? Busy is more important than parents?”Zhou zuolong said angrily, “This unfilial son, I think he’s deliberately trying to anger me!””

“Xie wanqiu sighed, she pretended to say, “It’s the same for this child, Jinbei. I’m his stepmother, so it’s normal for him to hate me. But you, you’re his biological father! How could he bear a grudge against you? This child shouldn’t have done that!””

The anger on Zhou Zuolong’s face was even more obvious.

“After saying that, Xie wanqiu continued, “It’s all because of me. If it weren’t for me, Jinbei would definitely not treat you like this.””

“”What does this have to do with you?”Zhou zuolong continued, “If it weren’t for you, would that unfilial son have come to this? He’s fine. Not only does he not know how to be grateful, he even sees you as his enemy!””

Wasn’t Xie Wanqiu treating Zhou Jinbei well enough?

“Not to mention his stepmother, even his biological mother would not be able to do what Xie Wanqiu did.”

“Xie Wanqiu was too kind. She never looked for reasons from others, but only looked for reasons from herself. If Zhou Jinbei was Xie Wanqiu’s biological son, he definitely would not be like this today.”

That B * Tch Wu Lan.

“She was already dead, yet she was still so disgusting!”

“Xie wanqiu smiled and said, “Old Man, you’ve been my husband and wife for so many years. Don’t you understand me? “Am I the kind of person who pays attention to these things? “I don’t care how the Children Treat Me. I just want the children to live happily! “Xiang Xiang and Jinbei, these two children, really have a tough life. It’s one thing for them to lose their mother when they were young, but now that they’ve finally managed to stand out, Shaoqing was actually deceived by a person like ye Zhuo! “Jinbei’s daughter-in-law is not someone easy to deal with either!””

Xie wanqiu could not stand Zhou Jinbei’s wife. Zhou Jinbei’s wife was the same as Zhou Jinbei. She had never taken her seriously and had never called her mother.

“Xie Wanqiu’s family had a divorced niece. Xie wanqiu wanted to introduce her niece to Zhou Jinbei. In this way, both the Zhou family and the Cen family would have to have the surname Xie!”

“Unfortunately, she never had the chance to tell Zhou Zuolong about this.”
