“After finishing the porridge, old Mrs. Cen accompanied Zhou Xiang to talk, and Cen Yuying walked out of the room. ”

“Seeing their eldest sister come out, Cen Yueya and Cen Yueying immediately went up to her. “Eldest sister, how is it? is mom willing to eat?” ”

Cen Yuying nodded.

“Hearing this, the two sisters heaved a sigh of relief. ”

“Cen Yueya smiled and said, “That’s good.” ”

“”Sigh, big sister and second sister, how did things turn out like this?”Cen Yueying’s face was full of worry. “Our Father is dead and Alive Again! and he even became a heartless lover who abandoned his family?” ”

“They had thought that such a thing would only exist in novels, but who would have thought that it would actually happen in their home, and the main character was their father. ”

“CEN yuying said, “Now that things have already happened, we can only face it.” ”

“”Face it? How Can We Face It? He already treated our mother like this?”CEN yueying continued, “Do we still have to recognize him? I Can’t get over this hurdle in my heart!” ”

“CEN Yueya continued, “Actually, from a certain point of view, this matter can’t be entirely blamed on dad. After all, he doesn’t remember anything.” ”

“Whether it was leaving Earth or marrying another, these things were not Cen Haifeng’s choice. ”

“Speaking up to this point, CEN Yueya continued, “Actually, our father is like a chess piece of the General Alliance. Everything was arranged in advance by them, including our father’s marriage and children on Earth.” ”

“”Who knows if he really lost his memory,”cen yueying continued, “Maybe the memory loss is just an excuse!” ”

“Although CEN yueying did not want to admit that her father was a Chen Shimei who abandoned his wife, things did happen. ”

“In this world, there were countless people who abandoned their wives and children for power! ”

“Cen Yueya looked at Cen Yueying, “I think our father is definitely not that kind of person! Third Girl, don’t be so extreme in your thoughts. First, investigate the matter clearly! If he really is the kind of person who abandoned his family and children for power, not to mention you, I will not acknowledge him either!” ”

“”I also hope that he is not that kind of person.”After saying this, CEN yueying turned around and left. ”

“CEN Yueya asked, “Where are you going?” ”

“To look for Shaoqing!”

She had to get to the bottom of this matter!

...

On the other side.

In the main alliance country.

Duanmu Feng and her were painting in the study when someone knocked on the door.

“Come in.”

The assistant pushed the door open and entered with an unsightly expression. “Miss. .”

“What’s Wrong?”Duanmu Feng put down the brush.

“The assistant looked at duanmu Fengyu and continued, “Miss. . Something happened.” ”

“What happened?”Duanmu Fengyu asked.

“”The, the Chief Alliance’s wife was locked up in the police station.” ”

“”What?”Hearing this, Duanmu Fengyu’s face turned pale. “Say It Again!” ”

The assistant had no choice but to bite the bullet and repeat it again.

“What happened?”Duanmu Fengyu asked.

The assistant shook her head. “I’m not too sure about what exactly happened. Little Suo only said that madam was locked up in the police station by the Chief Alliance. He didn’t explain the reason.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Duanmu Fengyu couldn’t care less about anything else and quickly walked out of the door.

“When she went to look for Mrs. Duanmu, Mrs. Duanmu happened to be walking this way. Like Duanmu Fengyu, Mrs. Duanmu’s face was full of anxiety. Seeing Duanmu Fengyu’s flustered look, she immediately guessed it, “Fengyu, you know about it too?” ”

“Yes.”Duanmu fengyu nodded. “What exactly happened?”

Why did Cen Haifeng send Duanmu Fengyu to the police station out of the Blue?

“Yesterday, Duanmu Fengyu had said that the imperial preceptor and the great elder definitely had a way to resolve this matter. ”

Why did something happen so quickly!

Mrs. Duanmu shook her head. “Let’s go to the police station first.”

“”Okay.”Duanmu fengyu continued, “Where’s My Dad?” ”

Mrs. Duanmu was about to speak.

“Duanmu fengyu continued, “Could it be that he hasn’t returned yet?” ”

“”No, no, no.”Mrs. Duanmu hurriedly explained, “Your Dad has already gone to the police station.” ”

The anger on Duanmu Fengyu’s face disappeared a little.

The mother and daughter rushed to the police station.

“A very flashy aircraft was parked at the entrance of the police station. A young woman walked out from the aircraft. She was dressed luxuriously and had an enchanting face. The woman walked directly to Mrs. Duanmu and Duanmu Fengyu, “This must be Mrs. Duanmu, right?” ”

Mrs. Duanmu looked her up and down. “I am.”

“”I’ve long heard that Mrs. Duanmu is not the wife of an ordinary family. Seeing her today really makes me blush.”The woman smiled and reached out her hand to her. “Hello, I’m Ning Er.” ”
