“Chapter 439: 122: Da Zao’s domineering entrance, slapping Feng Xianxian’s face! 7”

Translator: 549690339

How hypocritical!

Li Yueyue lay on the upper berth and stuck her head out towards the lower berth. She invited ye Zao to the canteen for a meal.

“Ye Zao looked at the time on the lower right corner of his computer. “I’m sorry, Yueyue. Let’s eat again tomorrow. I’m having dinner with my boyfriend tonight.” ”

“Li Yueyue said in surprise, “You have a boyfriend?” ”

Ye Zao nodded.

“Feng Xianxian also looked over. “Ye Zao, where is your boyfriend from?” ”

Ye Zao closed the computer. “He’s from Beijing.”

“Feng Xianxian continued to ask, “Is he also from our school?” ”

Ye Zao’s tone was indifferent. “He’s a socialite.”

A socialite?

“In other words, he was not going to school anymore! ”

It seemed that he was just an unemployed vagrant.

The look of disdain in Feng Xianxian’s eyes became more and more intense.

“Although ye Zhuo was talking to his roommates, his actions did not stop. Very quickly, he traced the IP address of the other party. ”

Ye Zhuo directly found the information of that person.

Zhang Dahai.

Male.

36 years old.

A person from Beijing.

A very ordinary internet hacker.

“Obviously, there was someone else who wanted to investigate her and Ye Shu. ”

Who was this person?

Ye Zhuo directly installed an invisible monitor on Zhang Dahai’s computer.

Zhang Dahai’s every move was under her control.

“At 6:30 pm, Ye Zhuo and Li Yueyue went downstairs together. ”

“One walked towards the cafeteria, while the other walked towards the school gate. ”

“Just as they walked out of the school gate, they saw a figure standing beside a luxurious car. ”

“He leaned against the car door and looked down at his phone, as if he was texting someone. He was wearing a moon-white robe, and there was a string of bright red Buddhist beads hanging between his fingers. ”

“The retro clasp was meticulously fastened at the top, and there was a hint of asceticism and coldness in the elegant atmosphere. ”

“Among the students, he stood out like a crane among a flock of chickens, which made people frequently turn around to look at the prime minister. ”

“When did you arrive?”Ye Zhuo walked over.

“I just arrived.”Cen Shaoqing opened the car door for ye Zhuo.

Ye Zhuo sat in it.

Cen Shaoqing held the steering wheel with both hands and started the engine. “How does the new school feel?”

“”Very good,”ye Zhuo replied. ”

“Are the roommates getting along well?”

“Ye Zhuo said in a pertinent manner, “One of the girls is not bad, while the other two are a little weird.” ”

Cen Shaoqing tilted his head. “Let me tell the school leader to Change Your Dormitory?”

“”There’s no need to go through so much trouble. Although it’s a little weird, it won’t affect me.” ”

Not long after. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

They arrived at the place for dinner.

“The dormitory had entrance guards, so after dinner, Cen Shaoqing sent ye Zhuo back to the school. ”

At the CEN residence.

“Old Madam Cen was sitting on the sofa reading the newspaper. When she saw Cen Shaoqing return, she asked, “You went to see Yezi?” ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Old Mrs. Cen said again, “I heard that the military training at Beijing University is very abnormal! Two years ago, the granddaughter of the old Wang family almost lost half her life. Did you tell the school leader to tell Yezi not to participate in the military training?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing turned to look at Old Mrs. Cen and said in a low voice, “There’s no need.” ”

“No need?”Old Mrs. Cen slammed the table and stood up. “Are you speaking human language? So You’re not the one being pondered over? You have no emotional intelligence at all! No wonder you’re still an intern!”

“”Don’t worry, Ye Zhuo isn’t as weak as you think.”Cen Shaoqing’s tone was indifferent. “Not only did she reject my proposal, but she’s also looking forward to military training.” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “My granddaughter-in-law is awesome!” ”

“After ye Zhuo returned to the dormitory, he took his pajamas to the bathroom to take a shower. ”

He had just come out of the shower.

“He saw Bai Xiaoman running in while panting, she said excitedly, “Xianxian! I, I just saw Professor Feng from the Institute of Science and Technology, Professor Zheng from the Department of Medicine, Professor MA from the Department of Physics, Professor Yin from the Department of Mathematics, as well as Dean Zhang and Dean Liu coming to our dormitory building! I also heard that they are coming to our dormitory!” ”

Ye Zhuo continued to dry his hair without any expression on his face.

“Li Yueyue asked curiously, “Why are there so many professors here all of a sudden? What are they doing in our dormitory?” ”

“Bai Xiaoman said, “I think they are definitely here to look for Xianxian! After all, Xianxian is the only top student in our dormitory! If the professors aren’t looking for her, who else can they look for?” ”

What Bai Xiaoman said was very reasonable.

“In this dormitory, other than her, no one else was more outstanding than her. ”

“Hearing this, Feng Xianxian’s face was full of joy. ”

“She did not expect that on her first day of school, she would cause such a huge sensation in the school. ”

“Feng Xianxian quickly picked up the mirror and checked her makeup. After all, the people who would be coming later were all important figures. Her position in the Lin family was not very stable. If she could get the recognition of the professors, Old Lady Lin would definitely like her even more! ”

It would also make Feng Qianhua look good.

“The more Feng Xianxian thought about it, the more excited she became. ”

“Bai Xiaoman walked to Feng Xianxian’s side. “Xianxian, after I heard about this, I couldn’t wait to come back and tell you the good news! They should be arriving in a while. Why Don’t I Touch Up Your Makeup First?” ”

Feng Xianxian nodded. “Then I’ll have to trouble you.”

Bai Xiaoman started to touch up Feng Xianxian’s makeup.

“Just as she finished touching up her makeup, there was a knock on the door. ”

“Bai Xiaoman said excitedly, “It must be the professors! Xianxian, go and open the door!” ”

“Feng Xianxian straightened her back and maintained a decent smile on her face. Under the envious gazes of Bai Xiaoman and Li Yueyue, she walked over to open the door. ”

“The moment the door opened, she saw a group of professors standing outside. ”

“Feng Xianxian was extremely excited, but she still tried her best to calm herself down. “Hello, professors. Hello, Presidents. I’m Feng Xianxian.” ”

“The bald professor who was walking in front said, “Hello, this student. May I know if ye Zhuo is here?” ”
