Qiu Di no longer had any patience.

She only wanted to make Yi Ling submit to her immediately!

“”Bad Woman! If you have any tricks, just use them! Let me tell you, I’m not afraid of your ancestors!”Yi Ling looked at Qiu di like this. ”

“Outwardly fierce, but inwardly weak. ”

“In front of such a bad woman, she must not lose her aura. ”

“Qiu Di held in her breath and raised a fake smile. She continued, “Yi Ling, Ye Zao is no longer here. Why do you have to go against me for a dead person? Sign a contract with me. I promise that I will do better than ye Zao!” ”

“Compared to her, what was ye Zao? ”

Ye Zao could not even compare to her hair! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“”Bah! You’re a bad woman! Do you think I’ll believe you?”Yi Ling said angrily. “Qiu Di, just based on you, do you think you’re worthy to compare to miss ye? You’re not even worthy to carry Miss Ye’s shoes! You’re a bad woman, a B * Tch! You’ll die a horrible death!” ”

“Although the spirit had been unconscious for a long time, it did not have any evidence to prove that this had anything to do with Qiu Di, but it had grown a brain! ”

“It was ye Zao’s spirit, and it knew ye Zao very well. ”

“If Qiu Di had once saved Ye Zao, Ye Zao would not have kept it a secret. ”

All of this was clearly Qiu di’s scam.

The spirit only wanted to escape immediately and tell the chief and the others what had happened here.

But it was locked in this confinement room and its energy had been completely sealed!

There was nothing it could do!

Qiu Di was extremely angry. She directly slapped the spirit with her palm and slammed her heavily against the wall. “Little Bastard! Say That Again!”

The most annoying thing Qiu di had heard in her life was comparing her to Ye Zao.

How could ye Zao compare to her!

Ye Zao was just an orphan that no one wanted.

And she was the eldest daughter of the Qiu family.

“If it wasn’t for her kindness in the past, ye Zao would only be her little servant now. ”

The real person who wasn’t even worthy of carrying her shoes should be ye Zao!

“Qiu Di clenched her fists tightly, and her entire body was trembling. ”

“Yi Ling only felt intense pain all over her body. She vomited a mouthful of bright red blood, dyeing her white fur red. “Bad Woman! You’re A Bad Woman!” ”

Autumn flute looked down at her. “I’ll give you one last chance. Think carefully whether you want to sign a contract with me or Not!”

“In Your Dreams!”The spirit stubbornly turned her head.

Autumn flute reached out and lifted her neck.

“The spirit just looked at autumn flute. There was no fear in her eyes. She only said, “Autumn flute, kill me.” ”

“Kill You?”Qiu Di narrowed her eyes. “Do you really think I won’t Dare?”

Little Bastard!

She really didn’t know what was so good about ye Zao that this little bastard wouldn’t betray her even if he died!

“Yi Ling smiled. “I know you dare, but I’m not afraid.” ”

“Qiu Di’s anger came from her heart. She tightened the strength in her hands, wanting to crush Yi Ling to death. ”

“Meanwhile, Yi Ling was prepared to die. She slowly closed her eyes. ”

“At this moment, not only was it not afraid of death, but it was also looking forward to it. ”

“Once it died, it would be able to see ye Zao. ”

“In a trance, the spirit seemed to see ye Zao’s silhouette in the air. ”

“She smiled and waved at it. “Doggie, come here.” ”

“A warm light appeared in the spirit’s eyes. “Da, da Zao!” ”

“At this moment, there was a ‘bang’in the air. ”

“Autumn town broke through the door and said angrily, “Di’er! What are you doing!” ”

“Hearing Autumn Town’s voice, autumn flute released the clothes spirit and turned to look. “Father,” ”

“The clothes spirit, who had fallen to the ground, clutched her chest and coughed. ”

“Autumn town looked at the clothes spirit on the ground and said, “Come out with me for a moment.” ”

Autumn flute followed autumn town’s footsteps.

The father and daughter came to the door.

“Qiu Changzhen said with a straight face, “What were you doing just now! Do you know that you almost made a big mistake!” ”

“Qiu di said, “Isn’t she just a little bastard? Is it worth father being so angry?” ”

“Qiu Changzhen continued, “We told the public that ye Zhuo passed the position of the Queen to you, but you can’t even subdue the clothes spirit, so how can you convince the public!” ”

“The female sovereign would not only have to face the eight great clans, but also the people of Chang Yue! ”

“Qiu Di also knew this logic, and continued, “That little bastard is invulnerable, what can I do? When the time comes, we can say to the public that it was overly worried and followed ye Zao Away!” ”

“If it wasn’t for the fact that it had already thought of an excuse, Qiu di would have directly killed him! ”

“Qiu Changzhen narrowed his eyes, “Di’er, you are still young! Yi Ling is loyal to Ye Zao, if it was ye Zao’s last words, how could Yi Ling have misspoken!” ”
