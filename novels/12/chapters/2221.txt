“However, even though Wen Yang felt that it was strange, she did not ask about it. ”

“Fan Mu was a little braver than Wen Yang. He looked at man Wen and continued to ask, “Don’t you plan to introduce yourself to Miss Ye?” ”

Man Wen shook his head.

“Why?”Fan Mu asked.

“MAN WEN continued, “The matter from before caused a storm in the city. If I were to introduce myself to her now, how would others view her?” ”

Fan Mu was stunned.

“If Man Wen did not say anything, he would have almost forgotten about this matter. ”

“Ye Zhuo and the man family had previously fallen out with each other and even went to the Galactic Court. If Man Wen and Ye Zhuo were to introduce themselves now, they would definitely be discussed by the outside world. ”

It was extremely cold at the top.

“Speaking up to this point, the corners of Man Wen’s mouth curled up and he continued, “Moreover, I think this is quite good.” ”

“They did not disturb each other, as long as they knew each other was safe and sound. ”

“Fan Mu nodded. “That’s true, but this time, we really should thank miss ye properly. Actually, there was a small interlude that caused me to misunderstand Miss Ye.” ” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“What small interlude?”Man Wen asked curiously.

Fan Mu told man Wen the entire process of the matter.

“At that, fan Mu continued, “Actually, I feel that even if I don’t take the initiative to look for Miss Ye, Miss Ye will still lend a hand. Damn it! “I forgot to apologize to Miss Ye just now!”However, his attitude toward ye Zhuo at the presidential palace was not good. ”

“”It’s fine,”man Wen said with a smile. “She won’t mind.” ”

“Fan Mu smiled and said, “That’s Good!”At that, he continued, “But we shouldn’t have much interaction with Miss Ye in the future, right?” ”

“Yes.”Man Wen nodded. “There won’t be any more.”

Fan Mu felt a little regretful.

“Ye Zhuo was a good elder sister, and Man Wen was also a good younger brother. ”

“But Man Wen felt unprecedentedly relaxed. He continued, “Let’s go back.” ”

“Okay.”Fan Mu followed Man Wen’s footsteps.

“Man Wen continued, “Did anything happen during the days when I wasn’t around?” ”

“”Nothing happened. It’s just that Zhao Shan Dong was bailed out by Manxing. But don’t worry, we’ve already sent people to keep an eye on him! Even if he receives the news now, it’s too late for him to escape!” ”

Man Wen nodded slightly. “That’s good.”

...

At the headquarters on the other side.

“Seeing that she had returned, CEN Shaoqing immediately went up to her. “Has everything been taken care of?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo reached out and hugged him. His expression was unusually tired. “Everything has been taken care of. We can go back now.”

“There’s no rush. You can rest for another two days.”Cen Shaoqing’s tone was low.

“As soon as he finished speaking, Cen Shaoqing tightened his arms and lifted her into the air. ”

“Ye Zhuo did not expect him to do this. He subconsciously wrapped his arms around his neck. His heartbeat also accelerated at this moment. From her angle, she could just see the man’s thin chin and his high nose bridge. ”

“”Cen Shaoqing,”ye Zhuo said softly. ”

“Yes?”Cen Shaoqing answered.

“Ye Zhuo asked, “Am I heavy? Do I need to lose weight?” ”

“You haven’t lost weight yet. Why would you need to lose weight?”Cen Shaoqing opened his thin lips. “Are all girls like this?”

Cen Shaoqing remembered that the four sisters at home were also like this. They kept saying that they needed to lose weight.

“Rollie was the husky that ye Shu raised. The little guy was already two years old, and he was especially gluttonous. He looked fat and strong. ”

“How could I not be heavier than Rollie!”Ye Zao was somewhat unconvinced.

“Cen Shaoqing laughed softly, and his lowered eyes hid a doting expression. “Why don’t we go back and compete?” ”

“”I can’t be bothered with you.”Ye Zao yawned, and his expression was slightly tired. ”

“It was a little distance from the front yard to the bedroom, so ye Zhuo continued, “Put me down, I’ll go by myself.” ”

“No need.”Cen Shaoqing said concisely.

“Then can you carry me?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“Yes.”

“Then can your waist withstand it?”

Cen Shaoqing’s footsteps paused. “Are you doubting my... waist?”

There was a hint of danger in his deep voice.

“After spending so much time with Cen Shaoqing, how could ye Zao not know the hidden meaning behind his words? ”

“”I’m sorry, I was wrong. I shouldn’t have doubted your waist. You’re good, you’re very good! Let’s go, I’m tired, I want to go back and rest.”Ye Zao used a yawn to hide his awkwardness. ”

Cen Shaoqing did not point it out. The corners of his mouth curled into a faint smile.

“”Zao Zao! Zao Zao!”At this moment, Shi Qingcheng ran over from the other side. When she saw this scene, she immediately covered her eyes with her hands and muttered, “Don’t look if it’s an indecent thing! Don’t look if it’s an indecent thing!” ”

“Ye Zao immediately jumped down from Cen Shaoqing’s embrace. “Qingcheng, why are you looking for me?” ”
