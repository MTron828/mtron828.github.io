“”You still say you’re not ye Han!”The chief continued, “If you’re not ye Han, then what’s with this Emei Thorn?” ”

Emei Thorn? Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Wu Han was stunned.

“So, the weapon in his hand was called the Emei Thorn? ”

He had never known it was called the EMEI Thorn.

He thought it was just an ordinary weapon.

“It’s called the Emei Thorn?”Wu Han asked?

“Yes.”The head chief nodded. “This is a birthday gift from Miss Ye. Your ancient martial arts were also taught by Miss Ye. Have you forgotten about it?”

“Hearing this, Wu Han frowned tightly. ”

“In his memory, there was no one else other than the autumn flute. ”

“Moreover, his ancient martial arts were clearly taught by the autumn flute sect. ”

“But the head chief said that the EMEI Thorn was given to him by Ye Zhuo, and his ancient martial arts were also from the Ye Zhuo sect. ”

What did the head chief mean by saying this?

“The head chief looked at Wu Han with eyes filled with confusion, then he said, “Group Leader Ye, I believe that with your character, you will definitely not betray Miss Ye! Tell me, what exactly is going on? You tell us the matter, and we will help you solve it. Otherwise, not only will we not be able to solve the problem, we might even hurt our own people.” ”

Team Leader Ye.

Hearing this address again.

“Wu Han narrowed his eyes. He seemed to have thought of something, but he also seemed to have not thought of anything. This kind of feeling was very strange. ”

He was clearly Wu Han.

Why did the great clan leader say that he was ye Han?

Who Was Ye Han?

Did he know ye Han?

“When the name Ye Han was mentioned, he felt as if he had lost something important. It was even difficult for him to breathe. ”

Why did he have such a feeling?

What was the reason for all this?

“The more Wu Han thought about it, the more his head hurt. It was as if something was about to rush out of his body, but it could not rush out. ”

It was as if he was restrained by something!

“Looking at Ye Han’s appearance, it was clear that he had betrayed ye Zao. ”

“Just as Wu Han was slightly dazed, a faint light flashed in the eyes of the head patriarch. He quickly pushed Wu Han away and used the laser gun to point at his head. ”

“”Ye Han, Miss Ye hates people who betray her the most. Today, I’ll help Miss Ye clean up the house!” ”

“As soon as he finished speaking, the head chief directly pulled the trigger. ”

The head chief really had the intention to kill.

“At the most critical moment, Wu Han clicked on the chip that was bound to his body. ”

Beep.

A transparent screen immediately appeared in the air.

The laser beam was blocked outside by the transparent screen.

The head chief’s pupils became bigger and bigger.

Because a word appeared on the screen.

Ye.

This was ye Zhuo’s exclusive system.

Seeing this ‘Ye’word was equivalent to seeing ye Zhuo himself.

Bang.

“The eldest patriarch directly knelt on the ground, his face somewhat pale. ”

“Wu Han just looked at the eldest patriarch kneeling on the ground, his face didn’t have any special expression, he said very indifferently, “Miss Qiu is the successor that Miss Ye personally acknowledged. Head patriarch, I can understand your loyalty to miss ye, but the dead have passed away, and those who know the circumstances are wise. I advise you not to do anything else!” ”

Qiu Di?

Qiu Di had no management ability at all. She only had a bag of skin and was ambitious. How could ye Zhuo let her be the successor?

“Even if he used his toes to think about it, he would know that it was impossible! ”

It was simply impossible!

“The head chief knelt on the ground, unable to understand what was going on. ”

Why did ye Han suddenly treat ye Zhuo like a stranger?

“After a moment, the head chief looked at Wu Han and immediately opened his mouth, “Leader Ye, do you still remember that matter where you risked your life with Miss Ye? Do you still remember that three years ago, when the insect race suddenly attacked, it was you and Miss ye who joined hands to protect the eight great clans and the Chang Yue Kingdom?” ”

No.

“Wu Han didn’t remember anything. Not only did he not remember, when the great clan leader said these words, Wu Han didn’t feel anything at all. ”

It was as if he was an outsider from the beginning to the end.

That wasn’t right.

He was an outsider himself.

“Thinking of this, Wu Han shook his head, allowing his thoughts to become clear. He absolutely couldn’t be led by the nose by the great clan leader. ”

“The eight great clans had never liked autumn flute. Now that they were acting like this, they were only trying to sow discord and cause a misunderstanding between him and autumn flute. ”

Wu Han curled his lips.

The great clan leader and the others thought too simply. He would never betray autumn flute for the favor that autumn flute had given him.

“Wu Han continued, “Great clan leader, I don’t know what you are trying to say. I’ll repeat it again. My surname is Wu, not Ye.” ”

“Do you know how ye Han got his name?”The chief asked.
