The subtext of this sentence was that she would either not fall in love or fall in love with the goal of getting married.

“If he ziteng wanted to fall in love with her, he had to make plans to get married. ”

“These words not only showed that she was a girl responsible for love, but also showed that she was different from the coquettish bitches outside. ”

He ziteng was indeed shocked by Xu Xiao’s words.

No girl had ever said such words to him.

And no one had given him such a shock!

“Xu Xiao was indeed a good girl. In order not to delay him, she had rejected his confession. ”

“In this society, there were really too few good girls like Xu Xiao! ”

He ziteng was speechless for a long time.

“Looking at he ziteng like this, Xu Xiao was very nervous. ”

What did he ziteng mean? Why didn’t he say anything?

Did He Ziteng See Something?

“If he knew, she wouldn’t have said this! ”

Wasn’t she a little too hasty?

What should she do now?

Could she say anything to make up for it?

“Just as Xu Xiao was about to say something to make up for it, he ziteng continued, “Xu Xiao, when are you going to date? I can wait for you.” ”

“Hearing these words, Xu Xiao was ecstatic. ”

Wait for her!

He ziteng actually wanted to wait for her!

“Xu Xiao suppressed the excitement in her heart and said without changing her expression, “Mr. he, actually, I’m really not worth letting you do this.” ”

“”You are worth it.”He ziteng looked at Xu Xiao and continued, “Xu Xiao, you are very worth it! There has never been a girl who let me do this!” ”

Xu Xiao was the first.

“Xu Xiao continued, “Mr. HE, there are plenty of women in the world. Actually, you don’t have to do this. There are many girls who are more outstanding than me in this world. I really am not worth you wasting your youth.” ”

No one knew how excited Xu Xiao was.

“He originally thought that he ziteng had seen through her tricks. He did not expect that he ziteng actually did not see through anything. Not only did he not see through it, he had even fallen into her trap! ”

“As long as he ziteng fell into her trap, she would make he ziteng tighter and tighter, so that he ziteng had nowhere to hide. ”

“Thinking of this, Xu Xiao’s lips curled up without a trace. ” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“”Xu Xiao, don’t reject me. Since I have already made up my mind to wait for you, I will definitely wait for you.”He ziteng continued, “Whether it’s one year, ten years, or twenty years, I will wait for you! When you want to fall in love, I will definitely be by your side.” ”

He ziteng felt that Xu Xiao was a very kind girl. Xu Xiao was worthy of him being like this!

“He believed that one day, Xu Xiao would be moved by him and she would accept him. ”

“Xu Xiao pretended to sigh. “Mr. He, do you have to be like this?” ”

“He ziteng nodded very seriously. “Xu Xiao, I have already said what I need to say. Don’t worry, I have never easily made a promise. Since I have made a promise, I will persist until the end!” ”

“Xu Xiao continued, “Since you want to wait, then you can wait. However, I can’t make a promise to you now.” ”

“”I don’t need your promise.”He ziteng said, “I’m willing to do all of this for you.” ”

Yes.

Willing.

There had never been a girl who could make he ziteng like this. Xu Xiao was the first and also the last.

Today’s Xu Xiao made he ziteng think of the future.

“As long as Xu Xiao nodded, he could even enter the marriage hall with Xu Xiao. ”

What a pity.

“Xu Xiao was different from the other girls he knew. If it were other girls, they would have nodded their heads and agreed. ”

“Xu Xiao looked at he ziteng and said, “Mr. HE, thank you for Your Love.” ”

“He ziteng smiled and said, “Although we can’t be a couple now, we can start as friends. There’s no need to be so distant between friends. I’ll call you Xu Xiao, and you can just call me by my name.” ”

“Okay.”Xu Xiao nodded. “Then I’ll Call You Ziteng from now on?”

“”Okay.”He ziteng looked at his watch. “It’s also time to eat. If you haven’t eaten, let’s go out for a meal together?” ”

“Sure.”Xu Xiao followed he ziteng’s footsteps.

The two of them arrived at a restaurant that he ziteng frequented.

“After eating, he ziteng sent Xu Xiao back. ”

“When the Xu parents saw that it was he ziteng who personally sent Xu Xiao back, they were especially excited. It seemed that Xu Xiao’s position as the Xu family’s Madam was secure! ”

“Mother Xu held Xu Xiao’s hand and said, “Xiaoxiao, how was it? What did he ziteng say?” ”
