These words were a little harsh.

Who would be willing to go against their ideals?

“”Moreover, we are not betraying at all! We are fighting for our ideals! We have made so much effort to land in Europe, I don’t know what you are thinking, but I am not willing to give up just like that! “No matter what, I want to land in Europe! “I want to fulfill my original dream!” ”

“Professor Feng raised his head and looked at director Ma. He didn’t know what expression he had on his face, but after a while, he slowly spoke, “Master five has shown US kindness. If it weren’t for him, we wouldn’t be here. You want me to betray the base at a time like this?” ”

Cen Shaoqing was only 19 years old back then.

“The 19-year-old boy had led them to make a name for themselves in the scientific research world in China, which was why they had their current achievements. ”

“Professor Feng and director Ma were classmates. Back then, they had made a mistake in the laboratory and were chased out of the laboratory by their Senior Brothers in the same laboratory. They had almost become famous in the scientific research world. ”

“At this time, Cen Shaoqing appeared! ”

“He was clearly only 19 years old, but his strength was shocking. ”

Just like the current ye Zhuo.

“If it weren’t for Cen Shaoqing, they would have become one of the hundreds of millions of ordinary people. ”

Professor Feng couldn’t get over the hurdle in his heart.

“Seeing that Professor Feng was so stubborn, director Ma was a little angry. So after he said so much, Feng Qi didn’t listen to a single word. ”

“”Feng Qi, I’ve already said it. This isn’t called betrayal!”Director ma continued, “This is called fighting for your own ideals! Landing on Europa is a matter that is beneficial to all mankind! “Miss Ye has denied you, denied our Europa Plan. Aren’t you angry at all? “Don’t you want to prove yourself at all? “Forget it, forget it. If you don’t want to land on Europa, then forget it. I’ll go talk to Dr. Gamira alone! When the time comes, just don’t regret it.” ”

“After saying that, director Ma turned around and left. ”

Professor Feng looked at director Ma’s back with a complicated look in his eyes.

Europa.

Could she really give up on landing on Europa?

“If she stayed by Ye Zao’s side, she would never be able to land on Europa! ”

No.

No.

She couldn’t give up her original dream just like that.

She wanted to land on Europa!

She wanted to prove herself to ye Zhuo.

To prove that Europa was indeed a planet with abundant resources and that Europa was not a dangerous planet.

“”Director Ma, Wait!”Professor Feng suddenly called out to director Ma’s back. ”

“The corners of director Ma’s mouth curled up, but when he turned around, the curve disappeared without a trace. “Professor Feng, is there anything else?” ”

“Professor Feng continued, “Director Ma, what if Miss Ye finds out? You know that Miss Ye hates betrayal the most.” ”

Director ma smiled faintly. He knew that Professor Feng would definitely switch sides. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“”Don’t worry. As long as we don’t tell anyone, Miss Ye will not find out.” ”

“Professor Feng continued, “But in this world, paper can not hide fire.” ”

“She wanted to follow Jamila and complete the plan to land in Europe, but she was afraid that ye Zhuo would find out. ”

She was caught in a dilemma.

“Director ma continued, “Dr. Jamila has already told me that he will change our nationality. In the future, we will be Chinese. Even if miss ye really finds out, what can we do? Moreover, this is Miss Ye’s own problem. If Miss Ye agrees to let us land in Europe, we will not be forced to make this choice.” ”

“In the end, this was all ye Zao’s fault. ”

“If it weren’t for ye Zao being too dictatorial, she would have easily rejected other people’s plans in order to prove herself. He and professor Feng wouldn’t have gone to country C! ”

Who Didn’t love their country?

“Even a rabbit would bite if it was anxious, let alone a human? ”

“Professor Feng continued, “Has country C already mastered the speed of light technology?” ”

“”That’s right, they don’t. That’s why they need our help,”director Ma continued, “Dr. Jamila has already promised me. “As long as they build an aircraft carrier that surpasses the speed of light, the first planet they land on will be Europa!” ”

“Really?”Professor Feng asked.

“Director ma nodded. “Dr. Jamila has personally promised me. If you’re worried, we can still sign a contract.” ”

Professor Feng Thought for a moment.

She was still hesitating.

“Director Ma added fuel to the fire. “Professor Feng, you only have one chance. You’d better think carefully. If you miss this chance, you won’t have this shop anymore!” ”
