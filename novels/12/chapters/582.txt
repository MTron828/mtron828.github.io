Translator: 549690339

Ye Zao took a sip of his cappuccino. “They should be relying on the fact that they’ve worked together before. That’s why they dared to do this. Remember to be more careful next time.”

“”Don’t worry, CEO Ye. I guarantee that there won’t be a next time.”This time, Li Shang was truly convinced. He also confirmed that ye Zao was bei Feng himself. ”

“After all, even he himself had not noticed the problem with the contract. Yet, Ye Zhuo had seen through it with a single glance. ”

“When Ye Zhuo exited the café once again, it was exactly 3:30 in the afternoon. ”

“Li Shang followed behind ye Zhuo. “President Ye, did you drive? Why Don’t I Send You Back?” ”

“No need. My boyfriend is over there. You can go back first.”

“Okay.”Li Shang nodded. “Then I’ll go back first.”

“Cen Shaoqing’s car was parked by the side of the road. At this moment, he was standing in front of the car door and answering a phone call. ”

Ye Zhuo jogged over.

Cen Shaoqing looked at her and opened the door of the passenger seat. “I’ve picked her up. We’ll be there soon.”

Ye Zhuo sat in the passenger seat.

Cen Shaoqing also came in from the other side.

“Where are we going?”Ye Zao said as he connected to the music player.

Cen Shaoqing held the steering wheel with one hand and the prayer beads with the other. “You should like it there.”

“Ye Zao continued, “How long will it take?” ”

Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips opened slightly. “About twenty minutes.”

“Then I’ll take a nap first.”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

Ye Zhuo leaned against the back of the chair and started to sleep.

“The car was playing pop music and the speed was very stable. Not long after, Ye Zhuo fell asleep. ”

Cen Shaoqing tilted his head to look at her. The glacier in his eyes melted and layers of warmth appeared.

“Twenty minutes later, the car stopped. ”

Ye Zhuo woke up on time. “We’re here?”

“Cen Shaoqing nodded. “Yes, we’re here.” ”

Ye Zao got out of the car and realized that this was the biggest race track in the capital.

“Shall we go in?”Cen Shaoqing reached out his hand to ye Zao.

Ye Zao put his hand on his and his warm palm immediately wrapped around her hand. The two of them held hands and walked inside.

“”Fifth brother! God! You’re finally here!”When they reached a corner, he ziteng ran out. ”

“Ye Zao said in surprise, “Big Brother He, you’re here too?” ”

“He ziteng smiled and said, “It’s not just me, there are many people inside! Come in quickly!” ”

The two followed he ziteng in.

There were more than ten people sitting in the viewing area.

“Cen Yuyan, who was sitting in the second row, smiled and said to song chenyu beside her, “How is it, Chenyu? Am I right? My fifth brother is Here!” ”

Cen Yuyan frowned slightly when she saw ye Zao beside Cen Shaoqing. “Why is she here? She doesn’t know how to race cars. Why is she here?”

Cen Yuyan was a little unhappy when she saw ye Zao again.

So many days had passed. She thought Cen Shaoqing had broken up with ye Zao Long Ago.

She didn’t expect ye Zao to still be standing beside Cen Shaoqing.

Cen Yuyan was very depressed when she thought of the limited edition ZY clothes again.

“After all, she was a loyal ZY fan! ” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“If ye Zao had clearly stated that it was a limited edition ZY, she definitely would not have thrown it away just like that. ”

Ye Zao must have done it on purpose!

“The smile on song Chenyu’s face froze for a moment when she saw ye Zao, but it quickly returned to normal. “It’s possible that miss ye also likes racing cars.” ”

“Cen Yuyan showed disdain, “Likes racing cars? I think she’s just a snob! She saw that my fifth brother likes racing cars, so she came along! This kind of girl is too fake! There’s not a single part of her body that’s real! Maybe even that face is fake!” ”

Ye Zhuo was too beautiful. Even song Chenyu paled in comparison when she stood in front of her.

One had to know that song Chenyu was a beauty that only appeared once in a thousand years!

“No matter how beautiful she was, how could she be more beautiful than a beauty that only appeared once in a thousand years? ”

“Therefore, ye Zao must have undergone plastic surgery. ”

A faint light flashed across song Chenyu’s eyes. No Wonder Ye Zao was so good-looking.

So it was not purely natural.

“”Yuyan, don’t say that. After all, Miss Ye is fifth master’s girlfriend.” ”

“Cen Yuyan snorted coldly. “What girlfriend? We’re going to break up sooner or later anyway! If it wasn’t for my grandmother’s meddling, Shaoqing wouldn’t have taken a fancy to her.” ”

“While they were talking, Cen Shaoqing and ye Zao had already walked over to the audience seats. ”

“Cen Yuyan stood up and said, “Shaoqing, Zao Zao.” ”

“Although she didn’t really like ye Zao in her heart, she still had to put on a show. She didn’t care about the monk’s face, but she cared about the Buddha’s face. ”

“Song Chenyu greeted from behind. “Fifth master, Miss Ye.” ”

“Ye Zao nodded politely. “Fourth sister, Miss Song.” ”

“He ziteng said in surprise, “God, you know Miss Song Too!” ”

“Ye Zao nodded slightly, “We met once before.” ”

“”God?”Cen Yuyan asked curiously, “Ziteng, why are you called Zao Zao called God?” ”

His brain must have been kicked by a donkey!

“He ziteng said, “Sister Yuyan, don’t you know? Fifth sister-in-law is a racing expert! She even won against Fifth Brother Last Time! That’s why I called her God!” ”

Racing expert?

A look of disdain flashed across Cen Yuyan’s eyes.

Someone like ye Zhuo dared to call himself a racing expert?

Did she think that racing was riding a bicycle?

“Cen Yuyan smiled and said, “That’s too much of a coincidence! Chenyu is also a racing expert. Why don’t the two of you exchange blows and let us open our eyes?” ”
