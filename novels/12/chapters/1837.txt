“”Whether he looks like him or not, I just don’t like him!”Yu Zhao said. ”

Chiaki comforted Yu Zhao in a low voice.

On the other side.

“After Wu Han left the office, Autumn Flute opened the file on the trans-star case. ”

“But in the next second, the smile on autumn flute’s face froze. ”

Because she actually couldn’t open the file on the trans-star case.

It was as if the information on the star-crossing case was glued together by some glue.

But there was clearly nothing on the information.

What was going on?

“Since there was no glue, why couldn’t she open it? ”

Could it be that she didn’t have enough strength?

“Qiu Di increased the strength in her hands, but the cover of the star-crossing case still didn’t move. ”

Qiu Di’s brows furrowed tighter and tighter.

The star crossing case information was fake?

Wu Han actually dared to use fake information to deceive her!

He was really too daring!

“Or could it be that Wu Han had already discovered something, so he used the fake information to test her? ”

“Qiu Di held the Communicator and was about to call Wu Han over to question him. After thinking for a few seconds, she seemed to have thought of something. She took the star crossing case information and went to the detector. She placed the star crossing case information into the detector and closed the door. ”

“A few seconds later, a crisp sound was heard in the air. ”

Di —

“According to the detector, there was nothing wrong with the information of the star crossing case. ”

The information of the star crossing case was real.

“Since the information was real, why couldn’t she open it? ”

“Qiu Di frowned, took out the communicator and started to contact Qiu Chang Town. ”

“Although Qiu Chang Town was a little timid, the older the wiser. Qiu Chang town had been in Chang Yue country for so many years, so she definitely knew the secret of the information of the star crossing case! ”

“No matter what, she had to open the information on the star-crossing case. ”

“On the other side, at the headquarters of the eight families. ”

“After learning that the information on the star-crossing case had been taken away by Qiu Di, the other seven patriarchs were very worried. ”

“After all, the information on the star-crossing case was not an ordinary item. ”

“If the contents were seen by Qiu Di, the consequences would be unimaginable. ”

“The three patriarchs stood up from their chairs, “What should we do now? Why don’t we work together to get it back? We can’t just watch Qiu di take away the information on the star-crossing case.” ”

“As soon as these words were said, everyone started to discuss animatedly. The expressions on their faces didn’t look too good. ” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“No matter which one of the father and daughter of Qiu Di and Qiu Chang Zhen ascended the throne, it wasn’t a good thing for the eight great clans. ”

“Once the Chang Yue country was ruled by the Qiu clan, it wouldn’t be far from destruction! ”

“Three hundred years ago, a top seer once predicted that the Chang Yue country would either survive in the world or be destroyed by the hands of the person with the surname ‘Qiu’. ”

“Because of this, the eight great clans had always avoided the people with the Qiu surname. ”

“Fortunately, the Qiu clan didn’t make any big movements these few years. ”

“Until after ye Zao’s accident, Qiu Di appeared. ”

“”Everyone, don’t be anxious.”The great clan leader raised his hand and slowly said, “Although the information of the star crossing case was taken away by Qiu Di, whether she can open the information of the star crossing case is another matter. “If the information on the star-crossing case is really seen by autumn flute, this means that autumn flute really has a phoenix life. We can only accept our fate.” ”

“Hearing these words, the other seven clan leaders became even more unsettled. “Great clan leader, what do you mean by this? What do you mean that autumn flute has a phoenix life? What kind of Phoenix life is autumn flute?” ”

“”Great clan leader, have you forgotten the prophecy from 300 years ago?” ”

“”No matter what, we can’t let Qiu Di succeed!” ”

“”As the head chief, how can you say such irresponsible words!” ”

“The head chief stood up and raised his hand. “Everyone, calm down. Please listen to me.” ”

“The seven clan heads looked at each other. They all saw a puzzled look in each other’s eyes. In the end, they all quieted down and looked at the head chief. ”

“The head clan leader continued, “When Miss Ye was still around, she had set up permissions on the data of the star-crossing case. If you don’t have the password, those who are not Phoenix orders will not be able to open the data of the star-crossing case. So, everyone, you don’t have to worry about autumn flute opening the data of the star-crossing case.” ”

“But what if autumn flute cracked the password?”The Five clan leaders asked.

“Hearing this, the other clan leaders immediately nodded in agreement. “How can you be so sure that Qiu di won’t be able to break the password?” ”

“The head clan leader maintained his smile and asked in return, “Do you think that just based on Qiu Di’s ability, she can break the password that Miss Ye personally set?” ”

“With that, the head clan leader continued, “If Qiu Di can break the password, then Miss Ye is no longer Miss Ye!” ”

Who Was Ye Zhuo?

She was the only strange woman in Changyue for two thousand years.
