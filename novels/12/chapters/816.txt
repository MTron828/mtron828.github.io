“Chapter 817: 179: face smacking. Lord Five: This is my girlfriend, ye Zao! 2”

He suddenly brought someone to the laboratory.

This meant that ye Zao was very special to Cen Shaoqing.

“No matter how one looked at it, it didn’t seem real. ”

Who Was Cen Shaoqing?

He was someone who stood at the top of the pyramid.

Would he be trapped by Love?

Tang Xue pinched her thigh hard.

Hiss...

It hurt. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

It didn’t seem like a dream.

“Before everyone could react, CEN Shaoqing turned to look at ye Zao and said, “Zao Zao, this is elder Zhao from the laboratory.” ”

“Elder Zhao.”Ye Zao followed behind and called for someone.

“Miss Ye.”Director Zhao was still in a trance.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “This is the technician from the technology department, Tang Xue.” ”

“Miss Tang.”

“Tang Xue smiled at Ye Zao. “Miss Ye, it’s a pleasure to meet you.” ”

“”This is Cen Jiang, Cen Hai.” ”

“Cen Jiang hurriedly took two steps forward. “Miss Ye, I’m Cen Jiang. You can just call me by my name.” ”

“Cen Jiang.”Ye Zao wasn’t shy and was very generous.

“I’m Cen Hai.”

“Cen Hai.”

“After getting to know each other, Cen Shaoqing looked at Cen Jiang. “What’s the problem with the laboratory?” ”

Tang Xue looked up slightly. “It’s a problem with the R & D Department.”

“Let’s go take a look.”

“Okay.”

The few of them walked towards the r & D Department.

“A new face suddenly appeared in the lab, and he was walking beside Cen Shaoqing. This made the other experimenters extremely curious. ”

Cen Shaoqing often came to the lab.

“However, almost none of the members of the opposite sex could stand beside Cen Shaoqing. ”

Tang Xue walked at the back.

“A short-haired girl pulled Tang Xue back and whispered, “Sister Xue, who’s That Girl? A new member of the R & D Department? She’s really beautiful!” ”

Tang Xue shook her head. “She’s not a new member.”

“Then who is she?”

“Tang Xue continued, “She’s Master Five’s girlfriend.” ”

Girlfriend?

The short-haired girl covered her mouth in surprise. “Is that true?”

“It’s true.”

“The short-haired girl wanted to say something else, but Tang Xue continued, “How can I joke about something like that?” ”

“But isn’t master five an unmarried man? Why would he fall in Love?”

Tang Xue’s expression was indifferent. “It’s just a relationship. It’s not like he’s getting married.”

Many unmarried men would fall in love.

“Since CEN Shaoqing had said that he was an unmarried man, he would not marry easily. ”

Ye Zhuo was beautiful and young. It was normal for CEN Shaoqing to be attracted to her for a moment.

“In this world, even if one got married, one could still get a divorce. What’s more, it was just a relationship. ”

Many irrational little girls were looking forward to having a relationship with the uncle.

“Little did they know that the uncle was knowledgeable, had broad horizons, and had high means. They had nothing in common with the uncle at all. ”

“In Tang Xue’s opinion, Ye Zhuo was still too young and unsuitable for Cen Shaoqing. ”

If Cen Shaoqing really wanted to get married...

Then he needed a good wife who could help him in any region.

And not a vase who didn’t know anything.

A vase was used to admire.

“The short-haired girl nodded and felt that what Tang Xue said made sense. “But I still didn’t expect that master five would actually fall in love. Even if master five didn’t marry her, she still earned it! That’s master five! The best in the world!” ”

“Ever since the establishment of the experimental base, CEN Shaoqing had been single. ”

“For example, the short-haired girl. Even Tang Xue had not expected it. ”

“Tang Xue continued, “I’ll go over first. Let’s talk after work.” ”

“Alright.”The short-haired girl nodded. “You go over first.”

“After some thought, Tang Xue continued, “Lele.” ”

“What’s Wrong?”The short-haired girl looked up.

“Tang Xue said, “Don’t tell Professor Yue about this first.” ”

“I know.”The short-haired girl nodded.

Tang Xue jogged to catch up with the crowd.

The short-haired girl looked at Tang Xue’s back and raised her eyebrows.

“Tang Xue didn’t want her to tell Professor Yue, right? ”

Then she had to tell Professor Yue about this.

Professor Yue and the short-haired girl were from the same laboratory. Professor Yue was the most old-fashioned professor in this experimental base. He was very serious.

...

The R & D Department was at the innermost part of the experimental base. The group walked for about ten minutes and was still at the east side of the base.

“Master Five.”

“At this moment, a middle-aged woman in her fifties walked over. Her hair was neatly tied behind her head. She was wearing a very serious black suit and gave off a serious feeling that she was not easy to get along with. ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Professor Yue.”

“Professor Yue looked at Ye Zhuo, who was following behind Cen Shaoqing, and said with a smile, “I heard that master five brought his girlfriend here. I thought they were talking nonsense! It seems like it’s true.” ”

“”It’s true.”Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted slightly. “Professor Yue, this is my girlfriend, Ye Zhuo. Zhuozhuo, this is professor Yue.” ”
