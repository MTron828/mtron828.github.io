“Madam Chen continued, “Of course, if you think it’s too little, we can add more.” ”

“You can add more?”Zhou Ying asked incredulously.

“Yes.”Madam Chen nodded. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Bai family Sheng was calmer than Zhou Ying. He continued, “Family head Chen, how can we help you? As long as we can help, we will do our best!” ”

The prerequisite was that they could help.

“The Chen family was much more powerful than the Bai family. If even the Chen family could not solve the problem, the Bai family would not even think about it. ”

“”Don’t worry. Mr. Bai will definitely be able to help you with this,”Chen Jinyan said. ”

“What kind of help?”Bai Jiacheng asked.

“Zhou Ying said impatiently, “Master Chen, don’t keep us in suspense! Tell US quickly!” ”

“Mrs. Chen smiled and looked at the two of them. “Mr. and Mrs. Bai, why do you have to pretend to understand?” ”

“From Chen Jinyan and Mrs. Chen’s point of view, Bai Jiasheng and Zhou Ying were pretending to understand. ”

Retreat to advance!

No wonder they had a vixen daughter.

Pretending to understand?

This stunned Bai Jiasheng and Zhou Ying.

“”We really don’t know,”Zhou Ying continued, “Mrs. Chen, don’t play charades with US and just say it!” ”

Bai jiasheng nodded. “Just say it.”

“Just as Mrs. Chen was about to lose her temper, Chen Jinyan said without batting an eyelid, “Since you really don’t know, then I’ll explain it to you. It’s like this...” ”

Chen Jinyan explained the entire process in a concise and comprehensive manner.

“When they heard this, Bai Jiacheng and Zhou Ying’s expressions were somewhat interesting. ”

“They did not expect that Bai Jingshu, who usually appeared to be quiet, would be more capable than anyone when it came to playing tricks! ”

No wonder they looked down on the person they had introduced to her. It turned out that she had secretly hooked up with the Chen family and even caused the Chen family to suffer such a loss.

“Although Bai Jiasheng was quite happy, he did not show it on his face, he continued, “Mr. Chen, Mrs. Chen, my wife and I really did not know about this! If we had known, we definitely would not have allowed my daughter to do this...” The Bai family paused for a moment before continuing, “However, this matter is not just my daughter’s problem. If your son does not have that intention...” ”

“Before he could finish his sentence, Mrs. Chen interrupted him. “Don’t try to be nice when you’ve gotten a bargain! Do you really think I don’t know what you’re Thinking?” ”

It was intolerable!

The Way Bai Jiasheng and Zhou Ying ate was really too ugly!

“Shut up!”Chen Jinyan looked at Mrs. Chen.

Mrs. Chen did not continue.

“Chen Jinyan looked at Bai Jiasheng and smiled apologetically. “It’s my opinion. Mr. Bai, please don’t take it to heart.” ”

“Bai jiasheng also knew the meaning of these words. If they really angered the Chen family, they probably would not get anything. ”

“”Family head Chen, you’re too kind. My wife was wrong just now!”After saying that, Bai Jiasheng looked at Zhou Ying. “Hurry up and apologize to Madam Chen.” ”

“Zhou Ying turned to look at Madam Chen, “Madam Chen, I know you’re angry, but as parents, we all feel the same way! Your Heart Aches for your son, and My Heart Aches for my daughter! Taking a step back, what if your son succeeds? Then wouldn’t my daughter be the one injured now?” ”

“Madam Chen was about to explode from anger, but she had no choice but to hold it in. ”

She had no choice.

She had no choice but to lower her head.

“After all, Chen Yaosheng’s future was now in the hands of the Bai family. ”

“”Mrs. Bai, you’re right.”Madam Chen turned to look at Zhou Ying. ”

“Zhou Ying curled the corners of her lips and continued, “Master Chen, Mr. Chen, if you want to resolve the matter between the two juniors, this box of star energy is probably not enough, right? After all, our Jingshu has two younger brothers!” ”

What she meant was three boxes of star energy.

“You mean three boxes?”Mrs. Chen asked incredulously.

“”Mrs. Chen is indeed like the rumors said,”Zhou Ying said. ”

Bai Jiasheng did not interrupt.

“Mrs. Chen was about to say something when Chen Jinyan continued, “I can fulfill Mrs. Bai’s request.” ”

“Since things had developed to this point, Chen Jinyan could only bite the bullet and swallow it. ”

“Really?”Zhou Ying asked.

“Bai jiasheng immediately replied, “That’s my opinion! The head of the Chen family will not go back on his words!” ”

“Chen Jinyan smiled and said, “Mr. Bai, you flatter me too much. However, although I am not a big shot, I know that a promise is worth more than anything. “Since both of you can accept the proposal, let’s make it a date. Let’s settle the marriage between the two children today.” ”
