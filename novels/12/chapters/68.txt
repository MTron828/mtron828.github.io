Chapter 69: Dominating the Internet, Overwhelming Strength!

Zhao Tao could understand Mu Yourong’s thinking. He smiled and said, “Yourong, you must not underestimate this newcomer. I’ve watched her live streams. Her chess skills are indeed quite good. Even Mr. Xiao Wan lost to her!”

Zhao Tao had been a manager for ten years, hence his judgment of people was very sharp.

Just by looking at the screen, even without seeing the newcomer in person, he could tell that this newcomer was extraordinary.

She did not have a team of people working with her, nor had she signed a contract with a company. She also did not put in any effort on marketing herself. Despite it all, within just half a month, her fan count had risen from zero to three million!

Could an ordinary person achieve such a feat?

Moreover, she had achieved all of these without revealing her face. This could only mean one thing. She was an expert and extremely skilled at her game!

Looking at the entire platform, perhaps only Mu Yourong could win against her. That was why Zhao Tao had arranged for Mu Yourong to challenge her in a game!

Hearing this, Mu Yourong pursed her lips, her eyes filled with disdain. “Mr. Xiao Wan has always been a dabbler. You should know very well how he became famous. If you want me to challenge that rookie, what’s the difference between that and losing my status?”

Mr. Xiao Wan became famous because he was not bad looking, and his voice sounded good through the subwoofer. That was why he had gained a bunch of female fans.

On the other hand, Mu Yourong was good-looking and skilled. How could Mr. Xiao Wan compare to her?

Zhao Tao smiled. “Why? Are you afraid of losing to that rookie?”

“Me? Lose?” Mu Yourong snorted.

Zhao Tao walked over and patted Mu Yourong’s shoulder, he smiled and said, “I know you won’t lose, which is why I suggested you challenge her to a game. Hitara’s popularity has been very high recently. She has gained 700,000 fans today! It’s said that there are teams that want to sign her and give her the title of Goddess of the Chess World.”

If this continued, Hitara’s popularity would soon surpass Mu Yourong’s! Hearing this, Mu Yourong’s expression changed.

It was said that one mountain could not accommodate two tigers. In the current live streaming world, she was the only No. 1, the only goddess in the go world! She absolutely would not allow anyone to threaten her position.

Her assistant, Xiao Lan, continued, “If Miss Mu had not disappeared for so long, Hitara would not have become so popular so quickly! She was simply taking advantage of the situation. She is too shameless! Miss Mu, the fans are also looking forward to you and Hitara battling it out! Teach her a lesson!”

“Alright then! I’ll play one round with her.”Mu Yourong turned to look at Zhao Tao. “Brother Tao, this can’t happen again.”

Zhao Tao nodded. “Don’t worry. This time, you’ll crush Hitara to smithereens, then she won’t have a chance to turn the tables later.”

Soon, it was eight o’clock.

Mu Yourong turned on her live stream right on time.

Seeing Mu Yourong, her fans were all very excited.

‘Rong Rong is finally back.’

‘I miss you so much!’

‘I heard that Rong Rong is going to challenge Hitara in a chess game tonight, is that true? I’m so looking forward to it! Recently, that Hitara has been really arrogant. A few days ago, she even beat Mr. Xiao Wan with her schemes. I like to watch a good face slapping the most!’

‘Rong Rong, slap her face!’

Mu Yourong said gently, “It’s been a while since I saw you guys. I miss everyone too. Actually, I don’t really want to fight with newbies. If word of it gets out, I would be suspected of bullying people. After all, we are all on the same platform.”

‘Rong Rong, don’t talk about losing face with this kind of person. You don’t even know how shameless that Hitara is! Last time, it was clearly Mr. Xiao Wan who let her win, but she was so ungrateful. She even said a lot of arrogant words!’

‘Sob sob sob… Rong Rong is so kind. ]

Seeing that the number of comments was increasing, Mu Yourong could only force herself to say, “Since everyone is looking forward to the game between me and Hitara, then I will listen to everyone for once. Just this once!”

‘Rong Rong is so amazing!’

‘I love you so much!’

When Ye Zhuo saw the game invitation, she immediately rejected it.

Firstly, it was because she did not know this person. Secondly, it was because she had promised to show everyone her LOL gaming skills tonight.

When she saw that her game invitation was rejected, Mu Yourong did not seem surprised. She was a grandmaster-level chess player, and she was very famous on the website. It was normal that the other party did not have the guts to take up her challenge!

However, facing the screen, Mu Yourong still pretended to be very surprised. “Ah! That Miss has rejected my game invitation. Perhaps she is busy? Why don’t we not disturb her?”

‘Hitara is scared, right?’

‘Hahaha! I’m dying of laughter. She’s scared to play even before the game has started!’

Mu Yourong’s tone was gentle as she said, “Don’t say that. It’s not easy for rookies to make it this popular either. I don’t think she intentionally rejected me. She’s probably just busy.”

After saying that, Mu Yourong continued, “And I heard that her chess skills are very good. She might even be better than me!”

‘Yourong, you are too modest!’

‘Hitara’s chess skills are not even one-third of Yourong’s. Yourong, you think too highly of her!’

‘Hitara is really shameless! She must have deliberately rejected you! ]

Mu Yourong concealed the smug look in her eyes very well, and her tone was gentle as she said, “Don’t say that. It’s normal for Miss Hitara’s chess skills to be better than mine. After all, there are many talented people in the world. The younger generation is very much capable of beating an old bird like me.”

When Mu Yourong said this, the comment section was filled with curses.

All of them were scolding Ye Zhuo for overestimating himself. A newbie actually wanted to compete with Mu Yourong for the position of chess goddess!

Shameless!

Ye Zhuo was about to start her game when she suddenly saw many discordant comments on the screen.

‘This streamer is a coward! She doesn’t dare to accept our Rong Rong’s challenge to a chess game.’

‘Shameless! White Lotus!’

‘Do you dare to accept our challenge?’

‘Trash, do you think you can beat our Rong Rong?’

Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly, “Who is Rong Rong? Do I know her?”

‘Ye Zi! Rong Rong is a Big V at the grandmaster level. I think she just sent you a game invitation, but you rejected it.’

‘Hey you, watch your mouth! Our Ye Zi is going to show us her LOL skills! We don’t have time for your challenges!’

‘What are you talking about? Did our Ye Zi provoke you?’

Ye Zhuo could tell that Rong Rong was not a friendly party, so she stopped playing games and said, “Babies, do you want me to play a game with her?”

‘Yes!!’

‘+1’

‘Ye Zi, Rong Rong’s fans have been asking you to do that for a few days. They are all jealous. They even said that you won against Mr. Xiao Wan using some underhanded methods. I have been displeased with them for a long time!’

‘Yes, yes, yes! Ye Zi, you can do it! Teach these rude people a lesson!’

“Okay, then I will play one round with her. After all, I am a person who dotes on my fans!” After saying that, Ye Zhuo tapped on the challenge button and invited her for a game.

‘Today is yet another day that we fall in love with Ye Zi.’

‘Ah, ah, ah! Ye Zi dotes on her fans so much!’

The moment the shared live streams got connected, she saw the person in front of the screen.

Ye Zhuo was a little stunned, thinking that she had seen wrongly.

This was…

Mu Yourong?

It really didn’t seem like she had seen wrongly.

Mu Yourong’s tone was gentle as she said, “Hi, young miss, nice to meet you.”

“Nice to meet you too” Ye Zhuo’s tone was nonchalant as usual

Seeing that the other party didn’t even dare to reveal her face, Mu Yourong smiled and said, “Young miss, you’re so thin, and your collarbone is so beautiful. You must be very beautiful, right?”

After saying this, Mu Yourong continued, “Little sister, you must be very good at taking care of yourself, right? Your hands are so white and soft, unlike me, I don’t even know the most basic skin care knowledge…”

Ye Zhuo smiled slightly, and her tone was clear as she said. “No wonder your skin is so dark.”

‘Hahaha! Yezi, you’re good! I’ve learned it!’

‘Ye Zi, you’re such a straightforward person!’

‘I’m dying of laughter!’

‘Ye Zi is simply a little expert in judging whores.’

Mu Yourong’s face froze, and her skin color turned a little yellowish when she heard it. Every time she opened her live stream, she would put on a layer of foundation and turn the filter to the maximum to cover up this flaw. It upset her the most when someone commented that she had dark skin.

She did not expect this little newcomer to be so arrogant! It seemed this rookie completely disrespected her without regard of her status.

“Young miss, your words are really interesting.” Mu Yourong avoided the statement and said with a smile, “Right, shall we begin? Is it convenient for you to play with me now?”

“Let’s begin.” Ye Zhuo did not waste any time.

The game began.

With the help of the system, Mu Yourong got rid of three of Ye Zhuo’s chess pieces at the start of the game.

She had the upper hand.

On the other hand, Ye Zhuo was not in a hurry either. She was taking her own sweet time. She noticed that Mu Yourong’s chess moves were a little strange. It did not feel like she was playing chess with someone, but rather with a machine.

Ye Zhuo raised her eyebrows slightly. Could there be a built-in hack on Mu Yourong’s body? Was she cheating?

“There goes your chariot.” Mu Yourong had a smile on her face and her tone was extremely gentle. “Little sister, you have to be careful. I’m about to checkmate.”

Prior to playing this game with Hitara, she had the impression that this rookie was very capable! It turned out that she was just a low-level White Lotus! Hitara’s chess skills were nowhere near as good as hers. Before she could even reveal her true abilities, the other party had already been utterly defeated.

To think that Zhao Tao was so wary of her.

Ye Zhuo’s tone was indifferent. “It’s a little too early for you to be so pleased with yourself. Don’t be a sore loser when you lose later! Don’t find some lame excuse that you’re not feeling well or that you’re intentionally giving in to a rookie like me!”

Mu Yourong smiled slightly and moved a chess piece on the keyboard. “Check! Little Sister, you’ve lost.”

‘Yourong is so amazing!’

‘Just asking if White Lotus’s face hurts from this tight face slap?’

‘Hahaha! The White Lotus has lost!’

‘Rou Rou is the undefeatable No. 1! How can a rookie even stand a chance against our No.1?’

“Are you sure you can check me?” Ye Zhuo’s tone was indifferent.

When she said this, Mu Yourong was stunned.

What did she mean?

“Take a closer look.” Seeing Mu Yourong’s blank face, Ye Zhuo reminded her.

The comments section was suddenly silent as everyone was also stunned.

After a while, everyone immediately came to a realization.

‘Ah! Ah! Ah! My blood is really boiling right now!’

‘+1! I’m crying!’

‘F*ck! Ye Zi is awesome! Ye Zi is awesome!’

‘Ahhhhh! Today is yet another day that we fall in love with Ye Zi.’

‘Oh my God! Ye Zi has refreshed my understanding of chess! It turns out that one doesn’t need to keep getting rid of the opponent’s chess pieces to win the game!’

‘This move is super epic! Ye Zi is amazing!’

‘Mom, I’m doing well! I just saw my streamer idol win against a Grandmaster!’

Mu Yourong frowned slightly. Only then did she realize that the opponent’s cannon had been waiting for her.

She had been careless!

She had actually fallen into the opponent’s trap.

She had taken one wrong step, and this wrong step led her straight into the enemy’s trap!

“I’ll give you a second chance. You can move your chariot back.” Ye Zhuo said.

Mu Yourong’s face turned pale, and beads of sweat appeared on her forehead.

She was a Grandmaster! Did she need to be given a chance by a nobody? But if she didn’t give in, she would lose!

What should she do now?

Of all the chess games that she had played before, this was the first time that Mu Yourong was faced with such a dilemma. Helpless, Mu Yourong could only seek help from the system.

The system should definitely be able to help her.

However, unfortunately, she was already in a dead end. Even the system couldn’t do anything to save her.

Seeing that Mu Yourong didn’t take any further action, Ye Zhuo didn’t stand on ceremony with her.

She moved her general.

[Checkmate! Black wins!]

Seeing this result, the comments section exploded!

‘So what if you’re No. 1? Our Ye Zi still defeated you!’

‘Our Daddy Ye is now your Daddy Ye!’

‘I love Ye Zi!’

[Account Notification: Heaven-toppling Purple Gold Hammer 1225 gifted a sports car to Hitara.YZ]

[Account Notification: Sincere 2005 gifted a sky full of fireworks to Hitara.YZ]

[Account Notification: Eternal Pirates gifted a sports car to Hitara.YZ]

Seeing that Mu Yourong had lost, her fans felt incredulous, and someone immediately began to lead the comments in the comments section.

‘What’s wrong with Rong Rong? Is she not feeling well?’

‘How could Rong Rong lose! It must be because she is not feeling well!’

If it was not because she was not feeling well, how could Mu Yourong lose?

However, Ye Zhuo’s fans were not to be trifled with. They immediately retorted back!

‘Here it comes! Here it comes! She’s going to come out with a lousy excuse for her defeat.’

‘It’s so easy to claim that one isn’t feeling well, that’s why one lost the game. So the No. 1 is no different from a certain Big V who won’t admit defeat!’

‘Are you sure she still deserves the title No. 1?’

‘No. 1, have some dignity!’

‘Won’t admit defeat! Won’t admit defeat! White Lotus, she’s a White Lotus!’

‘I’ve never seen such a shameless person. Since you can’t afford to lose, then don’t challenge others to a game! What’s the point of doing this now?’

Mu Yourong was just about to continue listening to her fans’ words, but when she saw these comments, her expression instantly changed.

If she used the excuse that her body wasn’t well, it would be as if she were admitting that she couldn’t afford to lose!

Now, she could only grit her teeth and swallow her humiliation. “It’s my fault that my skills are inferior to others. Young miss, you’re indeed very capable!”

“It’s a competition. It’s very normal to lose or win. Senior, you shouldn’t worry yourself over such things.”

Hearing this, Mu Yourong’s face turned even darker.

This little slut did not address her respectfully as a senior since the very beginning. Of all the times to address her as ‘Senior’, this rookie chose now, after she had lost!

‘Is she deliberately embarrassing me? Just you wait! I’m going to make you regret what you’ve done today!’

Mu Yourong maintained her gentle smile until the end of the live streaming session.

Zhao Tao walked in at the end of the live stream, clapped his hands and said, “To celebrate Yourong’s successful start on her first day back, I’m leaving work early tonight! I’ll treat everyone to crayfish!”

With that, the entire room fell silent.

Everyone looked at each other, very embarrassed.

Mu Yourong’s expression was even more terrifyingly gloomy.

Xiao Lan walked over and tugged at Zhao Tao’s sleeve.

“What’s going on?” Zhao Tao was puzzled. Wasn’t going to eat crayfish after ending work early worth cheering for?

Xiao Lan said in a low voice, “Miss Mu lost.”

“What?” Zhao Tao was immediately stunned. He had never thought that Mu Yourong would lose!

“You lost to Hitara?”Zhao Tao asked.

Xiao Lan nodded.

Zhao Tao’s face was full of surprise.

How could this be? Mu Yourong was so capable, how could she lose?

After a long while, Zhao Tao finally reacted. He walked to Mu Yourong’s side and asked with concern, “Yourong, are you not feeling well?”

Mu Yourong did not directly answer Zhao Tao’s question. Instead, she said, “I suspect that Hitara is cheating.”

She had the help of the system!

This Hitara could not be more powerful than the system!

Then there was only one possibility.

Hitara was cheating!

Right!

She was definitely cheating!

Zhao Tao narrowed his eyes. “What you said makes sense.” Although Hitara’s chess skills were not bad, in Zhao Tao’s heart, Mu Yourong was the number one! Moreover, Mu Yourong was a grandmaster. How could she lose to a nobody in the chess world?

If this wasn’t cheating, then what was?

Mu Yourong continued, “Not only cheating, I think this Hitara is also an ugly freak! Just like the former Princess of the Magnificent Tang Empire. Otherwise, why doesn’t she dare to show her face?”

Princess of the Magnificent Tang Empire was a very famous streamer.

She was even more popular than the current Hitara. She never showed her face and claimed to be a beauty that only appeared once in five thousand years, so she had to maintain her mysteriousness.

But unexpectedly, one day, the camera accidentally captured her face. The fans found that not only was this magnificent Tang Princess extremely ugly, but she was also a fifty-year-old aunt!

This matter stirred up a storm on the internet.

For a very long time, the Princess of the Magnificent Tang Empire was the talk of the nation.

Therefore, this Hitara who didn’t even dare to show her face was certainly an ugly woman!

After all, the Internet world was a world that looked at aesthetics. If Hitara was really that good-looking, why would she not show her face?

Thinking of this, the corner of Mu Yourong’s mouth curled up into a smile.

She was not only an ugly woman, she was also a liar!

Once this news was spread out, would Hitara still have a chance to turn the tables?

Just one lie was enough to make Hitara suffer!

People hated it when someone lied! That little b*tch! How dare she fight with her! She was such an ignorant tramp who didn’t know what’s best for her!

Mu Yourong turned to look at Zhao Tao. “Brother Tao, do you know what to do now?”

Zhao Tao nodded. “Yourong, you’re still the smart one.”

The next day, Mu Yourong turned on her live stream at the same time. Her mental state seemed to be a little bad. Her eyes were red, as if she had not slept well.

‘Yourong, did you not sleep well?’

Mu Yourong said in surprise, “Ah? You guys can tell that I don’t look too well today?”

‘Yes! But you still look very beautiful!’

‘Our Rong Rong is the most beautiful person in the world! Unlike some clown that keeps spewing nonsense!’

Mu Yourong continued, “I’m not that good at chess, and I was afraid to disappoint you again, so I stayed up late last night to read up some ancient chess books. I have to say that our ancestors are really very intelligent.”

‘Rong Rong is really hard-working!’

‘Rong Rong, you didn’t lose yesterday, the one who lost was that cheating dog!’

Mu Yourong asked in puzzlement, “What cheating dog? Why don’t I know anything about this?”

‘Hitara is that cheating dog! And an ugly one at that!’

Mu Yourong said, “You must have misunderstood that new girl. She doesn’t seem like the kind of person who would cheat. It’s a fact that I lost to her. Don’t worry, I can afford to lose. You don’t have to worry about me!”

‘Wah, Rong Rong, you are too kind, that’s why you find yourself at a disadvantage! Rong Rong, please don’t find excuses for her. A cheating dog is a cheating dog, and it can’t be washed clean.’

The more Mu Yourong defended Hitara, the more everyone felt that Hitara was cheating.

Mu Yourong took advantage of the situation and said, “Moreover, she has such a nice voice and such good-looking hands, so she must be even better-looking! She’s definitely not some ugly freak, nor is she the second Princess of the Magnificent Tang Empire!”

‘Rong Rong, ah! How can you be so innocent? She was so mean to you last night, yet you still speak up for her! You were fooled by her!’

The voice of the Princess of the Magnificent Tang Empire was also nice, but in the end, she was still an ugly freak!’

Seeing that the time was almost up, Mu Yourong said, “Alright, let’s not talk about this anymore. Let’s play chess.”

‘Yes, yes, yes! That ugly freak is not worth our time.’

…

Ye Zhuo was helping out in the restaurant, so she did not know what was happening on the Internet.

The business of the restaurant had been very good these days.

Fortunately, they had hired two more waiters. Otherwise, they would not have been able to cope with all the crowd at the restaurant. They were busy until ten o’clock in the evening before closing up the shop for the day.

Ye Shu said while mopping the floor, “Zhuo Zhuo, your most important task now is to study. Don’t come to help tomorrow night. There are eleven people in the restaurant now, so you can focus on your studies.”

Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “I’ve finished my homework. It’s okay. You don’t have to worry about me.”

At this moment, footsteps came from outside the door. “Is anyone here?”

“Who is it?”

Ye Shu raised her head slightly.

“Me!” An aunt with permed hair walked in from outside the door.

Ye Shu smiled and said, “May I know who you are?”

The aunt introduced herself. “My surname is Zhang. I used to be the lady boss of Zhang’s Braised Pork Rice Restaurant.”

“Oh, it’s you. May I know if you have something to say?”

‘Yes! Why wouldn’t I have something to say?’ When she thought of this, Auntie Zhang was furious.

She had rented this shop previously. If she had not transferred the lease of the shop to Ye Zhuo, would their business have been so good?

These businesses should belong to her family!

Seeing that the business of the Ye Family’s Private Kitchen was getting better and better, Auntie Zhang became more and more envious. She couldn’t eat well or sleep well. Every day, she thought about how to get back the money earned from the Ye Family’s Private Kitchen, because that was her money to begin with.

Aunt Zhang continued, “We’re all on the same side, so I won’t stand on ceremony. I rented your shop previously. If I hadn’t transferred the lease to you, would you have such a good business? Sister, I don’t think you’re an unreasonable person. You should understand the concept of making money together!”

Ye Shu frowned slightly. “What do you mean?”

“Then I won’t beat around the bush.” Aunt Zhang continued, “What I mean is that your family should split your profits with me!”

Actually, even Aunt Zhang felt that it was a loss to split the money with her. After all, before this, this was her shop. If she didn’t rent it to Ye Shu, all the money she earned now would be hers!

Hearing this, Ye Zhuo laughed.

After living for two lifetimes, this was the first time she had seen such a shameless person like Aunt Zhang!

“What are you laughing at?” Aunt Zhang looked at Ye Zhuo unhappily.

Ye Zhuo raised his eyes slightly, “I’m laughing at someone’s face. It’s really comparable to the thickness of the Great Wall of China!”

“How can you talk to me like that, little girl?” Aunt Zhang pointed at Ye Zhuo and said, “Do you know that the reason why your family’s business is so good is because of me! If I didn’t rent the shop to you, you and your mother would not have a place to open up your shop!”

“So, according to what you mean, we should thank you? “Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly.

“There’s no need to thank me.” Aunt Zhang continued, “Just do something practical. From now on, the money your family earns must be split 50-50 with me!”

“Isn’t 50-50 too much of a loss for you? Why don’t we give it all to you!” Ye Zhuo said seriously.

Aunt Zhang was stunned!

It seemed that this Ye Zhuo still had some self-awareness.

“50-50 is indeed a bit of a loss. How about this, I’ll take 90% and you guys take 10%.” Aunt Zhang pondered for a moment. “I’m too nice of a person! Your turnover these days should be at least 200,000! Quickly go and get me 180,000!”

Aunt Zhang said it as if it was a matter of course, and she did not feel the least bit guilty or embarrassed for saying that.

“200,000 is nothing. We’ve earned this amount within these few days!” Ye Shu stretched out five fingers.

Oh my God!

500,000!

Aunt Zhang’s eyes shone with a green light.

She did not expect the business at Ye Family’s Private Kitchen to be so good. However, this money was now all hers.

“Then you have to bring me 450,000!”

Ye Zhuo crossed her arms in front of her chest. “We did earn 500,000 yuan! Moreover, our restaurant has a long queue outside every day, and business is booming! But we won’t give you a single cent! How about it, Zhang Genhua, are you angry?”

Aunt Zhang’s full name was Zhang Genhua.

Zhang Genhua was very angry! She was so angry that her face turned pale. This little girl was simply too bold! She actually dared to challenge her! She even dared to call her by her name!

“You don’t want to give me the money, right? Just you wait! Don’t regret it! I won’t continue renting this shop to you anymore! I’ll make sure you don’t earn a single cent! I’ll call my niece right now and ask her to rent this shop to me!”

Zhang Genhua’s niece was Qinyue.

The reason why she dared to ask Ye Shu for money so boldly was because Qinyue at the sales office was her niece.

As long as she requested Qinyue to do so, Qinyue would be able to get the shop back!

Ye Zhuo looked at Zhang Genghua with a faint smile on her face.

Zhang Genghua had not expected Ye Zhuo to buy up the shop. Hence, she said proudly, “Well? Do you know the consequences now? If you know what’s good for you, hurry up and hand me the money. Don’t make everyone look bad! This money belongs to our family! I’m already merciful enough to leave you 50,000 yuan. Other people won’t be as generous as I am!”

Ye Zhuo cooperated with Zhang Genghua’s act very well. “God! I’m so scared! Please go and find Qinyue quickly and ask her to take back the shop!”

“Okay! Just you wait and see!”

Seeing that Ye Zhuo did not know what was good for her, Zhang Genghua did not hesitate to whip out her cell phone and dialed Qinyue’s number.

“Hello, Qinyue, this is aunt…”

When Zhang Genghua heard her niece’s reply, the expression on his face changed from complacency to anger, and finally to disbelief. Finally, a layer of sweat appeared on her forehead.

Even her voice became softer.

‘She had bought it!’

Never in her dreams did Zhang Genghua expect that Ye Zhuo would actually buy up all three shops.

Zhang Genghua’s legs went soft.

450,000!

Her 450,000 was gone.

Ye Zhuo’s voice rang out at this moment. “Mom, Hurry up and call the police. Tell them that someone here is trying to extort money from us.”

‘Call the police?’ Zhang Genghua’s body trembled and she dashed out of Ye Family’s Private Kitchen as if there were a monster chasing after her.

Outside the shop, Zhang Genghua sat on the ground and wailed. She was extremely sad.

Money!

All of it was supposed to be her money!

If she had known that the business here would be so good, Zhang Genghua would not have sublet the shop to Ye Zhuo.

It was useless to regret now.

Seeing Zhang Genghua sitting some distance away and crying, Ye Zhuo clapped her hands speechlessly. “I’ve never seen such a shameless person.”

Ye Shu smiled and said, “Zhuo Zhuo, it’s all thanks to you this time. If you hadn’t bought the restaurant, we would have been in trouble this time.”

Zhang Genghua was very difficult to deal with. She even had a niece who worked in the sales office. The sales office had a hundred ways to take back the house. If they really caused a ruckus, their shop might not be able to continue operating.

Ye Zhuo said, “Even if I didn’t buy it, I still have a way to deal with her.”

Ye Shu smiled as if she suddenly remembered something. “Oh right, Zhou Zhuo, you should sleep early tonight. We’ll go to your Sister Shasha’s house tomorrow.”

“Why are we going to Sister Shasha’s house?” Ye Zhuo was stunned.

Ye Shu said, “Your Sister Shasha’s boyfriend will come over tomorrow to announce their engagement and discuss the marriage.”

“So soon?” Ye Zhuo was stunned.

Ye Shu nodded. “I heard that her future husband’s family is quite well-off. Plus, Your Sister Shasha is dead set to have him as a husband. That’s why they decided to get married.”

At this moment, Ye Zhuo’s phone rang. She picked up the phone and realized that it was from an unknown number. “Hello.”

“Hello, I’m the director of Wonderful Sound Broadcasting. My surname is Du. May I know if you’re Hitara.YZ’s Ye?”

“I am.”

The other side continued, “I’m calling you because I want to inform you that two months later is the third anniversary of Wonderful Sound Broadcasting. There will be a gala at that time, and I sincerely invite you to attend.”

Ye Zhuo’s popularity had risen too quickly during this period of time. She had been on the recent headlines. She was very, very famous right now! The broadcasting platform wanted to use this to hype up their own popularity!

On the other hand, they also wanted to verify whether Ye Zhuo was the second Princess of the Magnificent Tang Empire.

Ye Zhuo was not interested in attending this kind of gala, so she tactfully said, “Thank you. I’ll consider it.”

The other side seemed to chuckle and then said, “The electronic invitation has been sent to your email. Please remember to check it when you go back. You’re welcome to attend our gala on time.”

“Okay.”

Meanwhile, Du Ruo had just hung up the phone when Mu Yourong on the other end of the screen asked impatiently, “How is it? Has she agreed to come?”

Du Ruo shook her head and looked at Mu Yourong on the screen. “No, she probably doesn’t dare to come.”

Du Ruo was the director of Wonderful Sound Broadcasting, and she had a very good relationship with Mu Yourong.

This was because when Du Ruo came to Yunjing on a business trip, she was robbed on the way and even stabbed by a gangster. If Mu Yourong had not happened to pass by and called the police in time, Du Ruo would have died.

Therefore, it was not an exaggeration to say that Mu Yourong was Du Ruo’s savior. This was also the reason why Mu Yourong was able to successfully sign a contract with Wonderful Sound Broadcasting.

Hearing this, Mu Yourong smiled and said, “I knew she wouldn’t dare to come.”

How could an ugly freak dare to attend such a large-scale party!

After saying this, Mu Yourong continued, “Sister Du, I heard that CEO Li will also be attending this party, right?”

Li Qiandong was Wonderful Sound Broadcasting’s boss. If Li Qiandong were to attend, then Fifth Master Cen would definitely come along.

Du Ruo nodded. “Yes, this year is Wonderful Sound Broadcasting’s third anniversary. Not only will the big boss be attending, the other shareholders will also be attending. At that time, we will broadcast it live on our platform.”

With that, Du Ruo continued to ask, “Yourong, will you be attending that day? After all, this is your first year joining Wonderful Sound Broadcasting.”

Mu Yourong nodded. “Yes, I’ve already promised my fans.”

Du Ruo smiled and said, “When that time comes, you will definitely be an existence that can captivate the entire audience!”

Although there were countless female streamers under the banner of Wonderful Sound Broadcasting, there weren’t many who were as beautiful as Mu Yourong.

“Sister Du, you like to make fun of me.” Mu Yourong continued, “There are plenty of people who are more beautiful than me. How can I captivate the entire audience with my beauty?”

Du Ruo said, “I’m not bragging at all. Yourong, you are so beautiful and your chess skills are good. On our platform, who can surpass you?”

Mu Yourong’s eyes hid a sense of pride.

She was a phoenix that roamed the nine heavens. If she did not captivate the entire audience, who would? When the time came, all the female streamers present would be her backdrop! The day that she finally got Fifth Master Cen’s was not far away.

“Right,” Du Ruo’s eyes flashed brightly as she continued, “CEO Li doesn’t have a girlfriend yet. Yourong, you’re so beautiful…” She did not need to complete the rest of the sentence. One could clearly understand what she implied.

These two were the best match!

Li Qiandong?

Mu Yourong’s eyes flashed with disdain. Compared to Fifth Master Cen, who was Li Qiandong? At most, he was just a stepping stone!

“Sister Du, you’re making fun of me again.” Mu Yourong’s face turned red. “How am I worthy of CEO Li?!”

Du Ruo naturally assumed that Mu Yourong was being shy. “I have a good relationship with CEO Li. When you come to Beijing, I’ll introduce you two to each other. Even if you don’t end up as a couple, it’s still not bad to be friends.”

Mu Yourong was worried that she wouldn’t have the chance to befriend Li Qiandong. She didn’t expect Du Ruo to take the initiative to set up a connection.

This was great!

Li Qiandong had such a good impression of her now. When the time came, she could use this stepping stone to get in touch with Fifth Master Cen.

After saying this, Du Ruo continued, “Alright, I’ll stop here. My mother asked me to join her for dinner. I’ll see you in Beijing in two months.”

Wonderful Sound Broadcasting’s headquarters was in Beijing, so the annual gala was also held in Beijing.

Mu Yourong nodded. “Okay, see you in Beijing.”

After ending the video chat, Mu Yourong began to pick out the gowns to wear for the gala.

Although there were still two months left until the gala, Mu Yourong wanted to make preparations for her presence to overwhelm the entire venue!

At the Ye family residence.

Because she was going to Lin Shasha’s house the next day, Ye Zhuo did not host any live stream sessions after she returned home that night. She took a shower, did a set of aerobic exercises, and then went to sleep.

Ye Zhuo did not turn on her live stream, so she naturally did not know anything about the gossip that had spread on the Internet. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The next morning, Ye Shu and Ye Zhuo arrived at the Lin family residence.

Lin Shasha knew that Ye Zhuo had not done any live stream sessions last night, so she assumed that Ye Zhuo had been hit by the blow. She held Ye Zhuo’s hand and said, “Zhuo Zhuo, don’t be sad. Those people on the Internet are jealous of you! Those who are innocent have nothing to fear! However, you’d better show your face tonight. Otherwise, those people will continue spewing nasty things about you!”

Ye Zhuo was so beautiful. Once she revealed her face, those rumors would naturally fall apart.

“Sister Shasha, what are you talking about?” Ye Zhuo asked in confusion.

“You… You still don’t know?” Lin Shasha looked at Ye Zhuo in surprise.

Ye Zhuo asked curiously, “What should I know?”

Lin Shasha immediately opened her phone and showed Ye Zhuo a short video.

This short video was very popular. It had two million likes and two hundred thousand comments.

The content of the video was that the female streamer who had recently become popular on the Wonderful Sound Broadcasting platform was not only a cheating dog, but she was also the second Princess of the Magnificent Tang Empire who was too ugly to dare reveal her face to the public.

The video claimed that she was a cheat and an ugly one at that!

The entire video was about flattering Mu Yourong to belittle Ye Zhuo.

The comments below the video were all scolding Ye Zhuo.

Whenever a fan spoke up for Ye Zhuo, they would be ridiculed. Although they were ridiculed miserably, those fans who truly liked Ye Zhuo still continued to defend Ye Zhuo.

Ye Zhuo pursed her red lips tightly. No expression could be seen on her face as she swiped her fingertip downwards.

Then, she saw a new video with the caption that said, ‘According to the latest reply from Wonderful Sound Broadcasting, Wonderful Sound Broadcasting’s third anniversary party invited new member Hitara.YZ, to participate, but YZ did not explicitly accept this invitation! I wonder if YZ was guilty of cheating during the chess match with MY Rong previously!’

Mu Yourong’s moniker was MY Rong.

There were thirty thousand comments below, all of them mocking YZ for being guilty and not daring to participate in the party.

After all, thieves were not allowed to see the light of day!

‘My heart aches for Rong Rong, to actually meet such an opponent.’

‘This is simply an insult to Rong Rong!’

‘Cheating dogs are shameless! They will die with their entire family!’

Even Lin Shasha was angry when she saw these unsightly comments, let alone Ye Zhuo. Lin Shasha quickly comforted her, “Zhuo Zhuo, don’t be angry. These people are all jealous of you! I think Mu Yourong is most likely responsible for this! Does she already know that Hitara is you?”

Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly. “I don’t think so.”

“Then what are you going to do now?” Lin Shasha continued, “Oh right, Zhuo Zhuo, did that Wonderful Sound Broadcasting platform really invite you to their third anniversary party?”

“Yes.”

“Zhuo Zhuo, you didn’t accept the invitation?”

Ye Zhuo said, “I was too lazy to attend these events before, but now that someone wants me to attend so badly, I will fulfill her wish!” In fact, Ye Zhuo did not care about it at all at first. However, when she saw that her fans were desperately defending her, she felt that she should do something for them!

The anniversary party would be so lively. Of course, she had to join in the fun!

Then, Ye Zhuo picked up her phone and began to record a video.

“Hello everyone, I am Ye Zi. I am very grateful to all my fans and babies for their support and protection. Here, I want to explain two things. Firstly, I didn’t cheat. She knows exactly who the sore loser is! Secondly, I will attend Wonderful Sound Broadcasting’s third anniversary party on time and send Miss Rong an invitation for a live chess match! A fair and just game! I wonder if Miss Rong is willing to accept my challenge?”
