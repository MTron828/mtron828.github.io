Chapter 123: 079: confirm the date of return, Strange Bite Marks 2

Seeing his father’s attitude, Lin ze heaved a sigh of relief.

If his father showed even the slightest sign of weakness.

His grandmother would probably be able to arrange for Feng Qianhua to marry in tomorrow.

Old Mrs. Lin was so angry that she did not eat breakfast. She let Auntie Zhang carry her back to her room to rest.

Lin Jincheng instructed the servants to brew the medicine.

They returned to their room.

Auntie Zhang comforted old lady lin, “Old Lady, it’s the New Year. Don’t be too angry. Miss Qianhua is so nice. Sooner or later, she will be touched by Jin Cheng and Young Master.”

Old Lady Lin sat on the sofa. “I’m Old and useless. My words are useless...”

“Actually, Jin Cheng used to listen to you,”Auntie Zhang said.

Hearing this, Old Lady Lin fell into deep thought.

When did Lin Jin Cheng start to rebel?

Before the age of eighteen, Lin Jin Cheng would do whatever she said.

Probably after knowing ye Shu, Lin Jin Cheng seemed to have changed.

Disobeying her everywhere...

Ye Shu!

It was all ye Shu! Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

That fickle woman, Ye Shu, was simply the Jinx of the Lin Family!

If not for Ye Shu, she and Lin Jincheng would not have come to this point.

“The family is unfortunate! The family is really unfortunate!”Old Lady Lin pounded her chest in pain.

Aunt Zhang continued, “Old Lady, please don’t think like this. Miss Qianhua is virtuous and virtuous. After she marries into the family, your relationship with Jincheng and the young master will definitely be much better. If it were up to me, this family would be fine without anything except the mistress.”

Old Madam Lin nodded. “You’re right.”

It seemed that she had thought of a way to get Feng Qianhua to marry into the family as soon as possible.

On the other side.

The Feng family.

The Feng family was a large family. Feng Qianhua had four older brothers.

Currently, all four older brothers lived with their parents.

Including Feng Qianhua’s mother, daughter, and grandchildren, there were more than 30 people in the large family. Fortunately, the Feng family’s three-story villa had five floors. Otherwise, it would not be enough to live in.

Feng Qianhua was a married woman with a burden. If it were not for the Lin family, she would have been kicked out long ago.

Even with the support of the Lin family, the sisters-in-law would still give her a hard time.

Just like now.

Third sister-in-law ding xuemin smiled and said, “Qianhua, you and Lin Jincheng have been together for so many years. It’s almost new year, and you’re going to be one year older. He didn’t tell you about it. When will he give you an explanation? “We sisters-in-law will also bask in the light and drink your wedding wine!”

Second sister-in-law Cheng Fengqin continued, “Third sister-in-law is right. Qianhua, you’re not young anymore. You Can’t drag this on any longer. If you drag this on any longer, you’ll turn yellow! “If Lin Jincheng is really unwilling to give you an explanation, the boss Shen that I told you about last time is also not bad!”

Who was boss Shen?

Boss Shen was a nouveau riche from Beijing.

Not only was he illiterate and ugly, but he also had a special hobby. Five of his wives had divorced him, and one of them jumped down from the eleventh floor because he couldn’t stand being humiliated. He was still lying in the hospital and hadn’t woken up yet.

Feng Qianhua held back the anger in her heart and looked up at her two sisters-in-law, “Thank you for your concern, third sister-in-law and fourth sister-in-law. I have a good relationship with Jin city. The reason why I haven’t registered my marriage is because I have to take into account the feelings of my two children. “Oh, by the way, please tell mom and Dad That I won’t be eating at home tonight.”

With that, Feng Qianhua got up and was about to leave.

Cheng Fengqin asked in puzzlement, “It’s the New Year. Where are you going?”

Ding Xuemin was also very curious.

Feng Qianhua smiled and said, “Tonight, I’m bringing Xianxian to Jin city for the New Year.”

Old Lady Lin had told her long ago that she was going to the Lin family for the New Year.

Hearing that, everyone in the room was stunned.

It had been so many years.

This was the first time Feng Qianhua was going to the Lin family for the New Year.

Could it be that she was really going to succeed?

“Really?”Cheng Fengqin was a little doubtful.

Others didn’t know.

But she knew very well.

It had been so many years, but Lin Jincheng had never taken a fancy to Feng Qianhua.

All this time, it had been the wishful thinking of Feng Qianhua and Old Lady Lin.

Otherwise, Cheng Fengqin wouldn’t have introduced boss Shen to Feng Qianhua.

“Look at what second sister-in-law said. Would I use such a thing to deceive people?”Feng Qianhua’s smile hid a knife.

Her family members were all smiling tigers.

They both hoped that she could marry Lin Jincheng and lead the Feng family to a new peak.

They were also afraid that she would marry into the Lin family and become the matriarch of the Lin family.

They wanted the horses to run and they also wanted the horses to not eat grass.
