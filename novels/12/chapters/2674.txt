“Then what can you absolutely do for us?”Cen Shaoqing retorted.

An Lizi:”...”

She admitted defeat.

An Lizi hugged ye Zao’s arm. “Shall we go downstairs and play mahjong? Just the four of us.”

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded.

The few of them went downstairs to play mahjong.

Ye Zao’s Luck was not bad. It was a good start.

“An Lizi threw out a piece of paper and said, “Lizi, I just saw your good friend Sister Sha Sha’s mother. Why didn’t I see Sha Sha?” ”

“Because of ye Zao, an Lizi also knew Lin Sha, and she also knew Lin Sha’s story. ”

“Ye Zao said, “Sister Sha Sha went abroad to study, and she won’t come back for nearly two years.” ”

“She went abroad to study?”An Lizi asked in surprise.

“Anlizi had always had a gentle impression of Lin Shasha. She had been lied to before and even got pregnant with a scumbag. Back then, when Lin Shasha had an abortion and was studying for the college entrance exam at home, many people were puzzled. ”

“After all, Anlizi was already twenty years old at that time. ”

“Just when everyone thought that Lin Shasha wouldn’t be able to get into a university, not only did Lin Shasha get into a university, but she also got into a key university. ” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“An Lizi thought that Lin Sha would work directly after graduation, but she did not expect Lin Sha to study abroad. ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“An lizi continued, “What is sister Sha Sha’s major?” ”

“”Fashion design,”ye Zao said. ”

“That has a bright future!”An Lizi said.

“Ye Zao nodded slightly, “It is indeed not bad. The main thing is that Sister Sha Sha likes fashion design.” ”

An Lizi sighed. “Sister Shasha’s life is too legendary. She can even write a novel.”

She dropped out of junior high school at the age of seventeen or eighteen.

“After dropping out of school, she went to work in a factory. Every day, she would go to work and go home for dinner. ”

“Then, she would get a boyfriend, get married, and have children. ”

“Finally, there were trivial matters. After getting married, she would be busy taking care of the children and complaining about her mother-in-law. If she met a good husband, she would be able to save some trouble. But if she met a husband who liked to play, the pain would come. ”

This was the current situation of many people.

“Originally, Lin Sha’s life trajectory was the same. However, she jumped out of the box and gave herself a different life. ”

“At this point, an Lizi looked at ye Zao and continued, “But it’s all thanks to you, Zao Zao. If it wasn’t for you, I Would Still Have Sister Shasha. We wouldn’t be where we are now.” ”

That was why it was important to make friends in one’s life.

Ye Zao had influenced a lot of people.

“Ye Zao smiled at an Lizi. “Lizi, the reason why everyone’s life is so exciting is because of her.” ”

“As a bystander, she could only play a guiding role. The one who really walked down the path was herself. ”

“If Lin Shasha hadn’t listened to her and cut ties with Zhang Qiang, Lin Shasha wouldn’t be where she is now. ”

“An lizi smiled and said, “Anyway, you are the idol I admire the most in my life!” ”

“At this point, an Lizi turned to look at Ouyang Cheng beside her and said, “Do you know what burning looked like when I first met her?” ”

“I don’t know.”Ouyang Cheng shook his head.

“An Lizi said, “She wore heavy makeup and looked like a little gangster. In short, she did not look very smart. “Actually, at that time, I was still a little afraid of her and didn’t dare to talk to her, because the people around her were always those bad students.” ”

“Thinking back to the past, an Lizi’s eyes were filled with memories. ”

She thought of many things and also many people.

“An Lizi continued, “You don’t know how incredible their class was when burning fire was admitted as the top scorer in Yunjing City!” ”

“Everyone knew that after ye Zhonghua lost her glamorous identity, she would never recover. Little did they know that this was the beginning of her real life, the beginning of her peak. ”

“Ye Zhonghua smiled and said, “Time flies.” ”

She still remembered the first time she opened her eyes in this strange world.

“”Yes, time flies too fast.”An lizi continued, “Oh right, I’ve always been curious. How did you and master five meet, Zhonghua?” ”

“Hearing this, CEN Shaoqing continued, “My grandmother sold me to her.” ”

“Ah?”An Lizi was a little surprised. “Really? What’s the situation?”

This sentence brought back a lot of memories for ye burning. “Yes.”

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Do you still remember where we first met?” ”

Ye burning thought for a moment. “After completing the OS system?”

“No.”Cen Shaoqing shook his head.

“No?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly and began to comb through his memories.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Do you still remember the night when the Mu family held the family recognition banquet?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing paused at this point and continued, “I was there that night too.” ”

It was this sentence that suddenly opened the door to ye Zhuo’s memories.

Ye Zao recalled the first time he met Cen Shaoqing’s eyes and his eyes curved. “My first impression of you was that you were not to be trifled with.”

“You still remember?”Cen Shaoqing was a little surprised. He thought that ye Zao had forgotten.

“Ye Zao said, “I had already forgotten, but you reminded me again.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted slightly. “Before this, I never believed in a single glance for ten thousand years, until I met you.” ”

“At this moment, an Lizi put down the mahjong in her hand and used her hand to tightly hold her mouth. This exaggerated expression attracted ye Zhuo’s attention. “Lizi, what’s Wrong?” ”

An Lizi instantly became more dramatic. “I’m afraid that I’ll make a dog bark.”

Ye Zhuo chuckled.

“An Lizi continued, “Do you know, Da Zhuozhuo? Just this silly dog of mine, he would never say these words to me.” ”

The silly dog was naturally referring to Ouyang Cheng.

Ouyang Cheng was a straight man. He always said what he said and never did what he did.

“Being suddenly called out, Ouyang Cheng rubbed his nose, feeling a little embarrassed. ”

“Ye Zhuozhuo continued, “It’s alright, it’s alright. Men all need to be taught. You just need to take your time.” ”

“An Lizi said, “I’m just afraid that the older generation will plant a tree and the younger generation will take advantage of it.” ”

“”I won’t,”Ouyang Cheng said at this moment. “I can swear.” ”

Ye Zhuo chuckled. “Don’t you think Ouyang is doing quite well?”

An Lizi also laughed.

...

At the South Station of the Beijing levitation train.

A mother and daughter walked out of the exit.

“Just as they walked outside, the middle-aged woman’s phone rang. She picked up the phone. “Hello.” ”

“”Little Sui, are you here yet?”A man’s voice came from the other end of the phone. ”

“”Yes, I’m here,”ye Sui said. ”

“”Then be careful.”The man continued, “By the way, can you find your sister’s home address?” ”

“”Don’t worry, I can find it. Just wait for my news at home.” ”

“Okay.”The Man on the other end of the phone suddenly sighed. “I’m just afraid that your sister won’t recognize us.”

“Hearing this.., ye Sui smiled and said, “After all, we’re blood-related sisters. How could she not recognize me? ! “Besides, she’s so rich now. Even if a little bit of money leaked out from her fingers, it would be enough for us to spend. Just wait for my news.” ”

Rich people didn’t care about that little bit of money at all.

“Okay.”

“After exchanging a few words with each other, they hung up the phone. ”

“Zhou Ziyue looked up at ye Sui and asked, “Is that my dad?” ”

Ye Sui nodded. “It’s your dad.”

“Zhou ziyue continued, “Mom, I’m actually a little worried too. What if Auntie ignores us?” ”

“Zhou Ziyue still felt a little guilty. After all, when Ye Shu was still down and out, she had never called ye Shu ‘Auntie’before. ”

“”No, aunt is still aunt.”Ye Sui was not worried about those things at all, “I didn’t have any conflicts with your aunt. Don’t worry, your aunt definitely won’t care about so many things! When you see your aunt later, remember to be a little sweeter and don’t call her names.” ”
