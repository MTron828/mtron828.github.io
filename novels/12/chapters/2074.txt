Man Wen couldn’t be bothered with him.

“Fan Mu continued, “I heard it from outside the window just now! TSK TSK, that sister of yours is really too good to you! You’re only nineteen years old, and she’s already looking for a partner for you! She even said that being of equal status isn’t important. She’s clearly trying to stuff someone into you!” ”

“Man Wen continued applying the medicine, grimacing in pain. ”

This Ye Han was too ruthless.

Wait for it.

He had to find an opportunity to take revenge.

“After saying that, fan mu continued to ask, “Right, your eldest sister isn’t coming back?” ”

“How many times do you want me to say it?”Man Wen raised his head to look at Fan Mu. “She’s not my eldest sister! She has nothing to do with me! Man Xing is my only sister!” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“The smile on Fan Mu’s face did not change, he continued, “Actually, it’s good that she’s not coming back! Your family’s waters are really too deep. She’s as free and easy as she can be in the Chang Yue Kingdom. She’s the Miss ye that everyone admires. Why would she come back to get involved in this muddy water?”Wasn’t this looking for trouble for him? ”

“The entire family looked simple, but in reality, none of them were simple. ”

“Otherwise, man Wen would not be in this state. ”

“After chatting for a while, Fan Mu’s gaze shifted to the direction of the door. He picked up his cup and drank some water, changing the topic, he asked, “Oh right, I heard that there’s another group of extremely beautiful and hot chicks at the dance venue. Do you want to Go Tonight?” ”

“Hearing that, man Wen put down the medicine in his hand excitedly. “Yes! Of course! When? is the news reliable? How many chicks are there?” ”

“Fan Mu smiled and said, “You’re so mentally handicapped! You’re already like this, yet you still want to go pick up chicks!” ”

“The next second, there was a knock on the door. ”

“Who is it?”Man Wen said impatiently.

“It’s me.”Man Xing’s gentle voice came from outside the door.

“Man Wen said, “Come in.” ”

“Man Xing pushed the door open and came in. “Man Wen, I brought you the medicine.” ”

“When he saw man Xing, fan mu immediately stood up from the bed. She was so nervous that she did not know where to put her hands. “Sis! Hello, Sis!” ”

“MAN XING smiled and said, “We are all of the same age. There’s no need to be so nervous.” ”

“Fan Mu nodded and continued, “Sis, I didn’t say anything to man Wen just now. I’ll be leaving First!”After saying that, she ran away in a flash. ”

Man Xing looked at his back and shook his head helplessly.

Fan Mu ran all the way to the door of the man’s house and then let out a deep breath.

In the house.

“Man Xing looked at man Wen, “I heard the conversation between you and Fan Mu just now. Don’t worry, I won’t tell my parents. “But man Wen, you’re not young anymore. You Can’t keep going on like this. You’re a boy. A man should be able to hold up the sky and the Earth.” ”

“Man Xing’s words were sincere and sincere, and she spoke with great principles. Unfortunately, Man Wen didn’t listen to her and said impatiently, “Are you bored? is menopause here?” ”

“Man Xing shook her head helplessly and continued, “This medicine is very useful for treating injuries. Remember to apply it. I’m leaving First!” ”

“After saying that, man Xing turned around and left. ”

“Just as man Xing reached the door, man Wen called out to her, “Sister.” ”

Man Xing smiled and looked back. “What’s Wrong?”

“Man Wen continued, “You will always be my sister. Apart from you, I will never acknowledge anyone else!” ”

“Hearing this, man Xing was touched and nodded. “Okay.” ”

On the other side.

At the CEN residence.

Today was the twenty-fifth day after ye Zao left.

“Cen Shaoqing maintained his previous habit of going to bed early and waking up early every day. He ate vegetarian and prayed to Buddha, and his life became colder and colder. ”

“In the past, when Ye Zao was by his side, he could at least see a little bit of popularity on him. ”

Now...

There was not even the slightest hint of fireworks.

“Old Mrs. Cen sat at the dining table and said worriedly, “Xiangxiang, have you noticed that things have been a little strange recently?” ”

“”What’s wrong, Mom?”Zhou Xiang asked. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “I haven’t seen Yezi for a long time. Also, fifth girl hasn’t been coming downstairs for breakfast recently!” ”

“Zhou Xiang also felt a little strange when she heard that. She looked at the servant beside her and said, “Go upstairs and see Fifth Master.” ”

“”Yes, Madam.” ”

The servant walked upstairs.

Cen Shaoqing was lifting a barbell in the gym when the servant knocked on the door.

“Come in.”A low voice came from inside the door.

“The servant pushed the door open and went in. “Fifth Master, Madam asked me to call you downstairs for breakfast.” ”

Cen Shaoqing did not say anything and nodded slightly.

“The servant continued, “If there’s nothing else, I’ll go downstairs first.” ”

“Okay.”

“The servant turned around and left. At that moment, Cen Shaoqing narrowed his phoenix-like eyes and kicked the kettle bell on the ground. ”

Bang.

The kettle bell directly hit the servant’s back.

“The servant fell to the ground. Her expression changed and she struggled to get up from the ground. However, Cen Shaoqing stepped on her back. “Say, who sent you?” ”
