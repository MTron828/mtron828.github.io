“”I haven’t seen him,”Bai Mo said. ”

“Liu Qing asked curiously, “The old man didn’t agree?” ”

“Bai Mo smiled and said, “The old man can’t wait to let them get married on the spot, so how could he not agree?” ”

“Then what’s going on?”Liu Qing became more and more curious.

“”Lin Ze is going to the old house tomorrow. Mom, Are You and Dad Going Tomorrow?”Bai Mo asked in return. ”

“Liu Qing pursed her lips. “It’s not like she married into a good family. She doesn’t even care about her own biological parents. Why should your dad and I join in the fun? If it were up to me, you wouldn’t go either!”Lin Ze was just a lowly earthling, in Liu Qing’s opinion, if Bai Mo went tomorrow, it would be no different from lowering her status. ”

The rumors outside were very unpleasant. Almost all of them were mocking Bai Jingshu.

“After all, Bai Jingshu was the first girl to marry an Earthling in the past thousand years. ”

Bai Mo curled her lips. “I’m different from you. I have to go.”

“As you wish.”Liu Qing waved her hand. “As long as you mind your own business and don’t bring back an Earthling for your father and me!”

“Hearing this, Bai Mo snorted coldly. “Mom, do you think I’m Bai Jingshu?” ”

Earthling?

How could an earthling be worthy of her?

“At this moment, Liu Qing seemed to have thought of something and continued, “Mo Mo, I heard that Bai Jingshu’s boyfriend once chased after you, didn’t he?” ”

“Yes.”Bai Mo nodded.

“Although Lin Ze didn’t officially chase after her, Ye Han had introduced Lin Ze to her after all. It could be seen that Lin Ze had a very good impression of her at that time. If she didn’t reject Lin Ze.., lin Ze would definitely be with her. ”

“Liu Qing continued, “Then you have to be careful! He definitely still likes you and Misses You! Otherwise, he wouldn’t be with Bai Jingshu! This kind of person is like a toad trying to eat a swan’s flesh. He’s overestimating himself!” ”

Lin Ze didn’t even look at himself in the mirror to see what kind of person he was!

A lowly earthling.

Was he worthy?

Bai Mo immediately reacted and narrowed her eyes

“She wondered why Bai Jingshu had gotten together with Lin Ze. It was obvious that Lin Ze couldn’t love her, so he found a substitute, and this substitute was Bai Jingshu. ”

“Bai Jingshu was her cousin, and they looked somewhat similar. ”

“Most importantly, Lin Ze could see Bai Jingshu from time to time after he got together with her! ”

Right.

Lin Ze must have had this idea in mind.

This was too shameless!

“Bai Mo felt a little disgusted, but seeing the relationship between Lin Ze and Ye Han, she endured it. ”

“”Mom, don’t worry. I know what I’m doing. I definitely won’t get involved with that kind of person like Bai Jingshu,”Bai Mo said with a smile. ”

Liu Qing nodded. “As long as you know what you’re doing.”

Bai Mo was a sensible child. She had never worried Liu Qing since she was young.

“”I’ll go back to my room first,”Bai Mo continued. ”

“Go back.”Liu Qing lowered her head and tidied her clothes. “I should go out too.”

“Bai Mo looked at her mother’s figure and wanted to say something. She opened her mouth, but in the end, she didn’t say anything. ”

“She was born into a family like hers. If she didn’t fight for herself, she would be stuck like this for the rest of her life. Therefore, she had to make a name for herself. She had to become someone everyone looked up to. ”

“After Liu Qing left, Bai Mo turned around and returned to her room. ”

“Soon, it was the second day. ”

“After all, it was his first time visiting, so Lin Ze was very nervous. He had prepared a lot of gifts. ”

“Early in the morning, elder Bai was waiting at the door. ”

The reason why he had waited for Lin Ze in advance was because he felt that Lin Ze was worth it.

“Not long after, he finally saw Lin Ze’s figure. ”

Along with Lin Ze was ye Han.

“Ye Han was also filled with emotions. He did not expect that after going around in circles, Lin Ze would actually end up with Bai Jingshu. ”

“”Xiao Lin!”Seeing Lin Ze, elder Bai immediately went up to greet him. ”

“Elder Bai.”Lin Ze raised his head to look at elder Bai.

“Elder bai chuckled and said, “We’re all on the same side. Xiao Lin, you don’t have to be so reserved. Just Call Me Grandpa like Jingshu!” ”

“”Grandpa.”Beside him, ye Han called him intimately. ” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Elder Bai looked up and said in surprise, “Mr. Ye is here too!” ”

“Ye Han said, “Brother Ze and I are of the same generation. You’re an elder. Just call me Xiao Ye.” ”

“”Please come in, please come in.”Elder Bai made a ‘please’gesture. ”

Lin Ze and ye Han went in.

“Lin Ze looked inside, but he did not see Bai Jingshu. He felt that it was a little strange. Just as he was about to ask, elder Bai continued, “Jingshu is in the back room!” ”
