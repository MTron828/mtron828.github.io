“Other than Cen Shaoqing, Cen Yuyan was her youngest daughter. A daughter needed to be pampered, so Cen Yuyan had always been pampered. ”

“Now that Cen Yuyan had become like this, other than feeling heartache, Zhou Xiang also felt a strong sense of failure. ”

It was her fault for being too arrogant to Cen Yuyan.

“Fourth girl!”Zhou Xiang raised her voice.

“”Let Her Go!”Old Mrs. Cen said coldly, “Just wait! Sooner or later, she will regret it!” ”

Regret?

Zhou Rui would make her regret it?

“Zhou Rui loved her too much, so how could she regret it? ”

It was impossible!

“Cen Yuyan originally didn’t want to pay attention to old Mrs. Cen, but when she heard this, Cen Yuyan couldn’t help but turn around and look at Old Mrs. Cen. She said sarcastically, “Grandma, in Your Lifetime, I’m afraid you won’t be able to see this day!” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen wasn’t angry either. She only said, “Remember what you said today!” ”

Cen Yuyan turned around and left.

She would remember this day forever!

“The Cen family looked down on Zhou Rui today. Sooner or later, all of them would regret it. ”

“With Zhou Rui’s ability, he would definitely not be inferior to CEN Shaoqing in the future. ”

His status would even surpass Cen Shaoqing.

“At that time, Zhou Rui would be someone that no one could compare to. ”

“Thinking of this, Cen Yuyan felt extremely happy. ”

Although she did not know when this day would come.

But she believed that this day would come sooner or later!

Zhou Xiang looked at Cen Yuyan’s back and wiped his tears.

“Old Madam Cen looked at Zhou Xiang. “Xiang Xiang, Don’t Cry! This fourth lass is getting more and more outrageous!” ”

Zhou Xiang took a deep breath.

“Old Mrs. Cen turned to look at the housekeeper. “From today onwards, stop all the bank cards of the fourth girl!” ”

“”Yes, Old Mrs. Cen.”The housekeeper nodded. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen then looked at the Cen Sisters. “And the three of you, no one is allowed to secretly help her!” ”

“”Yes, Old Mrs. Cen.” ”

“”Xiang Xiang.”Old Mrs. Cen looked at Zhou Xiang, “No one can blame the fourth girl for coming to this point. She can only blame herself! Which of the few children in the family didn’t grow up pampered? Why is she the only one who doesn’t have a brain? If I don’t give her some suffering to eat this time, she will always be like this! A loving mother is a waste of children. If you dare to secretly give money to the fourth girl, I will cut off your finances too!” ”

“Having been with Zhou Xiang’s mother-in-law for so many years, old madam Cen really understood Zhou Xiang too well. ”

Zhou Xiang was a soft-hearted person who was easy to talk to. She might even give Cen Yuyan money if Cen Yuyan said a few words in front of her.

“This time, old Madam Cen had to straighten Cen Yuyan out! ”

She wanted Cen Yuyan to see the essence of the situation through the surface.

“Otherwise, CEN Yuyan would always be like this. ”

“Zhou Xiang nodded. “I understand, mother.” ”

“Old Madam Cen turned to look at Cen Shaoqing and Ye Zhuo. “Shaoqing, Ye Zi, the two of you are not allowed to give money to the fourth girl either.” ”

“Don’t worry.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

Cen Yuyan walked out of the Cen family manor.

“The Cen family manor did not allow taxis to enter or leave, and there was not even a bus nearby. Cen Yuyan could only hail a taxi when she walked to the side of the road. ”

“Normally, she didn’t feel anything when driving, but after Cen Yuyan walked for half an hour and still hadn’t walked out of the Cen family manor, Cen Yuyan finally realized how big the Cen family was. ”

“Forty minutes later, Cen Yuyan got on the bus. ”

“Half an hour later, she arrived at her destination. ”

“A total of 98 yuan.”

“”Scan the code,”Cen Yuyan said. ”

“The driver didn’t even turn his head and said, “There’s a QR code on the back of the chair.” ”

Cen Yuyan opened Alipay and started to scan the code to pay.

Beep —

Payment failed.

The bank card you have bound is insufficient.

Cen Yuyan frowned slightly and clicked to change a QR code.

“Unfortunately, it still showed that there was insufficient balance. ”

The third or fourth card was not enough.

“Without even thinking, it was definitely Old Lady Cen who stopped her bank card. ”

She didn’t leave a single cent for her.

How ruthless!

“The driver couldn’t wait any longer and said, “Why don’t you pay in cash?” ”

“Cen Yuyan said a little embarrassedly, “I didn’t bring any cash. Please wait for a while. I’ll ask my friend to come over and help me pay.” ”

“After saying that, CEN Yuyan made a call. “Hello, Chenyu, I’m right below your house. Can you come over and pick me up?” ” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Okay.”

Song Chenyu quickly came over. “Yuyan!”

“Seeing song Chenyu, Cen Yuyan seemed to have seen her savior. “Chenyu, do you have money? Help me pay the fare.” ”

“”Okay.”Song Chenyu nodded and walked to the front of the car. “How much is the total, master?” ”

“98.”Song Chenyu handed the driver a 100. “Keep the change.”
