“Chen Siyan said a little embarrassedly, “Miss Ye, I still have some matters to attend to. Let’s talk later.” ”

“Go Do Your Thing!”

Chen Siyan nodded and walked towards Xia Wei.

“Xia Wei’s gaze met Ye Zhuo’s figure, and a look of amazement flashed across her eyes. ”

She was so beautiful!

Chen Siyan walked to Xia Wei’s side. “What happened?”

Only then did Xia Wei react. “CEO Chen called you. He said that it’s about the proposal. He still has some details to discuss with you.”

“Got it.”Chen Siyan nodded and followed Xia Wei to the elevator.

Ye Zao also returned to his room.

“When he booked the hotel, Ye Zao had specially booked a room on the first floor. As soon as he opened the window, he could see the flowers and plants in the garden. ”

“Meow –”

A Persian cat with shiny fur jumped onto the windowsill.

Ye Zao immediately reached out and picked it up. “You’re so cute! You look like a silly cat!”

“Thinking of brother Meow, the look in ye Zao’s eyes dimmed a little. ”

“”Meow.”The Persian cat in his arms moved closer to ye Zao’s face and sniffed it. He felt that the smell was pretty good, so he rubbed his small head on ye Zao’s face, meowing and acting coquettishly. ”

Ye Zao took a few selfies with the cat in his arms and sent them to Cen Shaoqing.

Cen Shaoqing was sitting at his desk and processing documents when he suddenly heard the sound of a wechat message. He immediately opened his phone.

The only person who could send him a message was ye Zao. There was no one else.

“He opened wechat and sure enough, it was ye Zao who sent him a message. ”

There were three selfies in total. Cen Shaoqing frowned when he saw the cat in ye Zao’s arms.

This cat was really ugly!

“At this moment, ye Zao sent a message. [ is this cat cute? ] ”

[ cute. ] Cen Shaoqing replied.

“After a while, Cen Shaoqing continued typing: [ want to kiss. ] ”

[ don’t you dislike the various parasites and ringworm on the cat? ]

“Cen Shaoqing did not like furry creatures. As long as ye Zao stroked the cat, Cen Shaoqing would explain the bacteria and viruses on the cat to her in a serious manner. ”

She did not expect Cen Shaoqing to change his personality after a few days of not seeing him.

“Cen Shaoqing curled his lips slightly and typed, “I’m talking about you.” ”

“Inexplicably, Ye Zao’s face turned red and he hugged the cat tighter in his arms. ”

“At this moment, Cen Shaoqing sent another message, “When will you be back?” ”

“Ye Zao replied, “Arrive at the Beijing Airport at One o’clock Tomorrow Night.” ”

Cen Shaoqing replied almost instantly: [ Okay. ]

[ I miss you. ]

Ye Zhuo looked at the message on the screen with a smile on his face.

“By the time ye Zhuo turned off his phone and was ready to go to bed, it was already past 11 o’clock at night. He did not even know what had happened to the cat. ”

On the other side.

The assistant booked Jin Yuyan’s flight ticket overnight.

The flight was at 12 o’clock at night.

It was exactly 11 pm the next day when they arrived at C nation.

“In the blink of an eye, it was the next day. ”

Ye Zhuo got up very early in the morning and ran around the back garden of the hotel several times before heading to the restaurant for breakfast.

“At 11:50 pm, Ye Zhuo dragged her luggage and went to the front desk of the hotel to check out. “Hello, A1988.” ”

The front desk took the room card with both hands and checked out.

“Just as ye Zhuo dragged her luggage out of the lobby, she suddenly remembered something. She had not greeted song Shiyu, so she took out her phone and called Song Shiyu. ”

Song Shiyu quickly picked up. “Hello.”

“”Brother song, it’s Ye Zhuo.” ”

“I know.”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “I’m going back to China today.” ”

“”When’s The Flight? I’ll get my assistant to arrange a driver for you,”song Shiyu said. ”

“”No need.”Ye Zhuo pulled his suitcase out as he said, “A friend has already come to pick me up.” ”

“”Okay, I wish you a safe journey.”Song Shiyu continued, “Send me a text message after you successfully return to China.” ”

“”Okay, that’s all for now. I’m hanging up.” ”

“Okay.”

Ye Zao Hung Up the phone.

“Outside the hotel, Carl’s car was already waiting. ”

“Seeing ye Zao come out, Carl immediately went forward to take the suitcase from ye Zao’s hands. ”

“Before getting into the car, Ye Zao looked up at the top of the hotel. ”

“To be precise, it was a window on the eighth floor. ”

She had a feeling that someone was looking at her from the window.

“But when she looked up, she saw nothing. ”

“Was it an illusion, or was it Jin Yuyan’s people? ”

Ye Zhuo narrowed his eyes.

Song Shiyu’s heart was racing as he hid by the curtain.

Almost.

Almost.

Ye Zhuo had seen him.

“After a long while, song Shiyu finally calmed himself down. ”

“A moment later, Song Shiyu sent a message to his assistant. ”

“After receiving the message, the assistant immediately called the housekeeping manager. “Tom!” ”

“”Hello, Mr. Assistant.” ”

“The assistant immediately said, “A1988 has just checked out. Ask the cleaning department not to clean up for the time being!” ”

“”Okay.”After hanging up, Tom immediately went to the cleaning department. ”

“However, the cleaning department manager said that the cleaning staff had already gone to clean up the room. ”

Tom was so scared that his face turned white. He hurriedly ran to Area A.

“Fortunately, when Tom arrived, the cleaning staff had just opened the door. ”

“Stop!”

“The cleaning staff was shocked by Tom. “Manager, is there a problem?” ”

“”A 1988, wait for the notice to clean. Before I give the notice, no one is allowed to come in and clean!” ”

“Okay.”The cleaning staff nodded.

She didn’t want to clean it properly. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

It would just reduce the pressure on her at work.

On the other side.

In Korea.

“After Jin Yuyan got off the plane, she immediately rushed to the palace, not daring to delay for even a moment. ”

“Thinking about how she was about to receive her mother’s praise, Jin Yuyan was still very happy. ”

“As the eldest princess of Korea, she had done a lot for Korea over the years, but she had not received a single word of praise from her. ”

“When she arrived, the office door was closed. ”

Secretary Zhou was standing guard outside the door.

“”Secretary Zhou, is my mother inside?” ”

“Her Majesty the Empress is receiving an important overseas call. Please wait for a moment!”

Jin Yuyan nodded.

In the office.

“Jin Xi’en said respectfully to the other end of the phone, “Don’t worry, I will definitely give you a satisfactory result.” ”

“It was unknown who said that, but Jin xi’en continued, “Yes, yes, yes. I promise you, there will never be a next time!” ”

“After hanging up the phone, Jin Xi’en picked up the microphone on the table with a face full of anger. “Let her in!” ”

“Okay.”

“Secretary Zhou hung up the phone and looked up at Jin Yuyan. “Eldest princess, Her Majesty the Empress wants you to enter.” ”

“Okay.”Jin Yuyan nodded and pushed the door open.

“Jin Xi en just stood there. From the looks of it, his expression did not look too good. ”

Jin Yuyan frowned slightly. What happened?

“Mother.”

Jin Yuyan walked to Jin Xi en’s side. “Did those ignorant people make you angry again?”

Slap!

Jin Xi en flipped his hand and slapped her. “B * Stard!”

“Jin Yu Yan was so frightened that she hurriedly knelt down. “Mother! Mother, what did I do wrong?” ”

“Who told you to touch Miss Ye?”

Miss Ye?

Jin Yu Yan was stunned for a moment before a look of disbelief appeared on her face.

“Jin Xi en wasn’t talking about ye Zao, right? ”

Where did ye Zao come from?

Was It Worth Jin Xi en making a move on her?

It was a mistake!

It was definitely a mistake.

Ye Zao was just a small Chinese.

“Jin Yuyan looked up at Jin Xi’en. “Mother, are you... are you talking about ye Zao?” ”

“Bastard!”Jin Xi’en slapped Jin Yuyan’s face again. “Is Miss Ye’s name something you can just say?”

“Secretary Zhou walked into the room and stood beside Jin Yuyan. “Your Majesty, the eldest princess is your biological daughter. If you have anything to say, you can say it properly.” ”

“Jin Xi’en looked at Jin Yuyan and said slowly, “From today onwards, Jin Yuyan will be stripped of her status as the eldest princess and demoted to a commoner. She will be expelled from the Royal Family Forever!” ”
