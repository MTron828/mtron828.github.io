Translator: 549690339

Old Lady Cen originally did not want to scold Old Lady Lin.

“After all, Old Lady Lin was also ye Zhuo’s biological grandmother. ”

But she really could not bear it anymore!

“Ye Zhuo was the granddaughter-in-law in her hands, but Old Lady Lin, this biological grandmother, insulted ye Zhuo like this. ”

How could old lady Cen Bear This?

Old Lady Lin was furious that old lady cen pointed at her nose and scolded her like this.

“Apart from Old Lady Cen, who else dared to scold her like this? ”

“Moreover, it was because of ye Zao! ”

Was Old Lady Cen’s brain damaged because of her age?

She actually scolded an old friend of many years just for a wild girl.

“Could it be that in Old Lady Cen’s heart, her weight was inferior to a wild girl? ”

She was truly bewitched!

“Old Lady Lin stood up from her chair, she looked at old lady cen and said, “I think the one who is truly blind should be you! Why Don’t You Think About It? Why would i rather Shaoqing marry Xianxian than have him have anything to do with ye Zao? Ye Zao is my biological granddaughter. If there was no reason, would I do this?” ”

Who Didn’t like biological granddaughters?

The point was that ye Zao was not worth her liking.

“After returning to the Lin family for such a long time, ye Zao had not even come to visit her once. ”

She was not willing to change her name.

“She was not even willing to give her a name. She even tried to sow discord in front of Lin Jincheng, and now, she even tried to snatch Feng Xianxian’s boyfriend! ”

Where in the world would there be such a rebellious granddaughter?

“Old Madam Cen pointed angrily at Old Madam Lin. “Because you’re sick, and it’s not light!” ”

It was an incurable disease!

There was no cure!

Old Madam Lin wanted to curse at Old Madam Cen.

“But when she thought of Feng Xianxian, she took a deep breath and suppressed all her dissatisfaction, “Bai Tang, calm down and listen to me properly! We have been old friends for many years, so I don’t want Shaoqing to be deceived by Ye Zao. This Child Ye Zao doesn’t know how to be filial to his elders at all. He has never taken me, his grandmother, seriously...”. “...”. “...” ”

“The more Old Lady Cen listened, the angrier she became. She directly interrupted old Lady Lin’s words, “Who is your old friend? I don’t have an old friend like you! It would be a disgrace if it were to be known! With a grandmother like you, I feel chills for Yezi! You’re not worthy to be Yezi’s grandmother! It’s also because Yezi has a good temper. If I were Yezi, I wouldn’t acknowledge you as a grandmother! I’m telling you very clearly now, other than Yezi, no one else is worthy to enter our Cen Family!” ”

“No One?”?

Old Lady Lin was furious.

Old Lady Cen actually said that Feng Xianxian was no one.

“She liked Feng Xianxian so much, but old lady cen treated Feng Xianxian so badly. How could old Lady Lin not be angry? ”

She was so angry that she was about to explode!

She was muddled!

This Bai Tang was muddled. She could not differentiate between good and bad. She mistook the fish eye for a pearl!

“However, when she thought about how Feng Xianxian would marry into the Cen family in the future, she couldn’t have any conflicts with Old Lady Cen Right now. Otherwise, what would she do if Old Lady Cen gave her little shoes to Feng Xianxian to wear in the future? ”

“”Bai Tang! Can you not be so impulsive! Xianxian is really a very good and filial girl. If Xianxian didn’t like your Shaoqing, do you really think that I would be willing to come? Don’t be ungrateful! You want an inch and a foot!” ”

“”You don’t want to come, right?”Old Lady Cen pointed at the door. “Then, please leave our Cen family immediately! Our Cen family doesn’t welcome blind people like you!” ”

Old Lady Lin was stunned.

She didn’t expect Old Lady Cen to chase her out!

She also didn’t expect Old Lady Cen to push down their many years of friendship and step on it.

“In front of so many servants, Old Lady Lin’s face was somewhat embarrassed. ”

“Didn’t you hear me when I told you to leave?”

“Seeing Old Lady Lin standing there without moving, Old Lady Cen pointed to the door and repeated it again. ”

“”Bai Tang!”Old Lady Lin said angrily, “You will regret it very much!” ”

Old Lady Cen was waiting to cry after missing out on such a good granddaughter-in-law like Feng Xianxian!

“Old Lady Cen placed her hands on her hips. “The one who should be regretting should be you! I think you are raising a tiger as a threat! The heavens are watching. The Heavenly Dao is good for reincarnation. Who will be spared? Just wait and see. Sooner or later, you will suffer retribution!” ”

Old Mrs. Lin was so angry that she turned around and left. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Old Mrs. Cen sat on the sofa, panting heavily from anger! ”

Crazy!

“That old fool, Bai Tian, Zhao fangyue, was simply crazy! ”

Old Mrs. Cen only regretted that she did not perform well just now. She should have scratched old Mrs. Lin’s face.

“Coincidentally, Zhou Xiang came back from the SPA at this time. “Mom, Aunt Lin came just now?” ”
