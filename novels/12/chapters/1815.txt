“Although she was a little tipsy, she was still conscious. ”

“The waiter bowed slightly and said, “These two glasses of wine are for you from the two gentlemen over there.” ”

“Hearing that, Li Yueyue looked up and saw two young men sitting near the booth. At this moment, they were also looking at them. ”

Ye Zao’s expression did not change. “Thank you. We don’t need it. Please return.”

“The waiter was stunned for a moment. Then, he picked up the cocktail on the table and said, “I’m sorry to bother you.” ”

This was the first time he had seen a guest reject a treat.

“Under normal circumstances, a young female guest would not only accept a treat from another guest, but she would also try to get the other party to pay for it. ”

Young and beautiful girls did not need to pay when they entered the bar. This had already become an unspoken rule of the bar.

Who would have thought that someone would reject them today!

The two young men sitting in the booth were also very surprised.

“They were very familiar with the bar owner and had hooked up with many young and beautiful girls here. They thought that they would be able to get their hands on a beauty today, but they did not expect the other party to reject them directly. ”

It was such a pity to have such a beautiful beauty!

“This girl must be playing hard to get with us!”The slightly plump man directly pressed the cigarette butt into the ashtray.

“The Thin Man nodded. “Brother Biao, what you said makes sense.” ”

“After saying that, the two of them looked at each other and stood up from their chairs, walking towards ye Zhuo and Li Yueyue. ”

Ye Zhuo was holding a cup with Li Yueyue.

“At this moment, the chair beside them was suddenly pulled open. Then, two men, one fat and one thin, sat beside the two of them. ”

“”Beauty, shall we be friends? Let me introduce myself. I Am Xinglong, and I am friends with the boss of this Qing bar.” ”

“Ye Zhuo drank the last sip of the cocktail leisurely. Then, he turned his head slightly, opened his red lips slightly, and very simply said, “Get lost.” ”

Get lost?

“Hearing this, not only did the skinny man not get angry, but he smiled and said, “Beauty, you’re so angry. Do you need your brother to help you lower your anger?” ”

The Fat Man opposite him smiled and echoed.

“Although Li Yueyue was usually a bit fierce, she was still a little afraid when faced with such a situation. ”

She didn’t even dare to make a sound. She secretly took out her phone and wanted to call the police for help.

“”Beauty, it’s just making a friend. There’s no need to be so serious, right?”The Fat Man reached out and took Li Yueyue’s phone away. ”

“Li Yueyue looked at the phone that was taken away by the Fat Man and swallowed her throat. She said nervously, “Give... give it back to me.” ”

“The Fat Man held the phone tightly and looked at Li Yueyue. He teased, “You want the phone? Give me a kiss and I’ll give it back to you!” ”

These women were all pretentious!

“They had already come to the bar, why were they still pretending to be good girls? ”

Pa..

“At this moment, ye Zao picked up the Long Island iced tea beside him and splashed it on the Fat Man’s face. ”

The Fat Man was stunned by the splash.

The Thin Man opposite him was also stunned.

“After a while, the fat man slammed the table and stood up. “Little girl! You Dare to Splash Me! Do you know who I am?” ”

Ye Zao pinched his right hand.

The sound of bones cracking could be heard in the air.

Bang!

“By the time everyone reacted, the originally arrogant fat man and Thin Man had already been pressed onto the table by Ye Zao. ”

They were unable to move.

This scene directly shocked the other people in the hall.

Who would have thought that a seemingly weak girl could hold down a strong man with one hand!

It was really too scary.

“Apologize.”Ye Zao opened his red lips slightly.

“Not only were the two men held down by a little girl, they even had to apologize in front of so many people. It was simply too embarrassing! ”

No!

They could not apologize!

“Seeing that they did not have any reaction, ye Zao increased the strength in his hands. ”

It hurt.

It was very painful.

The two of them almost cried out in pain.

“Apologize.”Ye Zao’s voice sounded above their heads again. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“S-sorry... we were wrong...”the two of them apologized with a sobbing tone.

“This girl’s strength was really too strong. If they did not apologize, their necks would probably be snapped by her. ”

Only then did ye Zao release his hands slightly. “Scram!”

“Hearing this, the two of them ran away without looking back. ”

Their speed was so fast that it was as if there was a flood or a ferocious beast behind them.

“This scene was also witnessed by the manager of the bar. The more he looked at this girl, the more familiar he felt. ”

It was as if...

“He had seen her somewhere before, but he just couldn’t remember where he had seen her before. ”

Could it be that he had remembered wrongly?

The manager frowned slightly.

In the hall.
