“Hearing this, Bai Yuanyuan reached out and hugged Bai Mo.. ”

...

On the other side.

“After returning to Earth, Lin Ze and Bai Jingshu boarded the interstellar shuttle to return to Earth. ”

“After the two of them left, Bai Mo followed. ”

“However, she did not directly tell Lin Ze that she was also going to Earth. ”

She wanted to give Lin Ze a surprise.

“After she completely understood Earth’s culture, she would definitely make Lin Ze’s eyes light up. ”

“Bai Mo had made some strategies about Earth in advance, but when she walked out of the interstellar shuttle, she could not help but feel disgusted. ”

The conditions on Earth were too terrible!

“There were hover trains and all kinds of top-notch flying machines everywhere in the s galaxy, but there was actually no trace of such high-tech on Earth. ”

“Bai Mo was starting to wonder if Bai Jingshu really liked Earth, or if she just wanted to please Lin Ze. ”

“Logically speaking, how could a person from a high-level galaxy like Bai Jingshu really like the culture of such a low-level planet? ”

“Therefore, Bai Jingshu was definitely faking it. ”

She didn’t like the culture of Earth at all. She was just hunting.

Lin Ze was her prey!

Bai Mo narrowed her eyes. She was waiting. She had to let Lin Ze see Bai Jingshu’s true colors.

“When the time came, the scene would be spectacular! ”

“After walking out of the interstellar shuttle, Bai Mo covered her nose and followed the map to the other side. ”

After walking for about 15 minutes.

“Suddenly, the scene in front of her eyes brightened up. ”

“There were tall buildings in front of them, and there was a lot of traffic. It was a scene of prosperity. ”

Bai Mo was stunned. This...

It seemed to be a little different from the earth that she had imagined.

Bai Mo even suspected that this was really earth?

How would Bai Mo know that the place she chose to land was the garbage center!

“The Garbage Center was built outside of the downtown area, and they had to pay attention to the environmental impact. Naturally, it wouldn’t be good. ”

“”Is that Miss Bai?”At this moment, a male voice sounded in the air. ”

Bai Mo turned around and looked at the man in front of her. “I am.”

“”Miss Bai, I am Liu Chao. Please follow me,”the man said respectfully. ”

Bai Mo followed Liu Chao’s footsteps and arrived in front of a silver-gray van.

“Before they got into the van, they could smell the pungent smell of gasoline. ”

“The S galaxy used energy, so they had never smelled gasoline before. At this moment, the smell was especially sensitive. ”

“What’s that smell?”Bai Mo covered her nose and asked.

“Liu Chao continued, “Miss Bai, this is a type of fuel. I’ll send you to your place now.” ”

Bai Mo frowned. “Are there no other means of transportation?”

Of course there were other means of transportation.

But Liu Chao did not have one.

“After all, Liu Chao was just an ordinary person on Earth. His material life had not reached the peak yet. ”

“Not yet.”Liu Chao shook his head.

“”Forget it, I’ll walk over.”Bai Mo turned around and left. ”

“”Miss Bai, please wait a moment.”Liu Chao followed up. ”

“Bai Mo said impatiently, “Is there anything else?” ”

“Liu Chao said, “This place is quite far from our destination. If we were to walk, it would take at least a few hours.” ”

“What?”Bai Mo widened her eyes in disbelief.

It would take several hours to walk?

What the hell was this place?

How did Bai Jingshu endure all these years?

“She didn’t know how Bai Jingshu endured it, but Bai Mo couldn’t. ”

“”Miss Bai, do you... Do you still want to continue walking?”Liu Chao asked. ”

Bai Mo frowned and turned to walk towards the van.

Liu Chao immediately opened the door. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Bai Mo walked into the van.

“The weather in Beijing in June was already hot. The air conditioner in the van was not turned on, and the entire van was filled with the stench of shoddy sofas and pungent gasoline. In addition, the air in the van was already stuffy and hot, causing Bai Mo to almost vomit when she sat inside, she almost vomited in disgust. ”

This feeling was really too uncomfortable.

“Seeing Bai Mo’s ugly expression, Liu Chao quickly sat in the driver’s seat. “Miss Bai, please bear with it. I’ll turn on the air conditioner right away.” ”

“As Liu Chao spoke, he started the car. As the car started, the smell of gasoline became stronger. Bai Mo was not feeling well, and her small face turned pale. ”

“Liu Chao turned to look at Bai mo. “Miss Bai, let me buy you some motion sickness spray.” ”

“”No need, drive quickly!”What kind of effective motion sickness spray could there be on earth? It was most likely a lie. Rather than hoping that motion sickness spray could alleviate the symptoms, it was better to let Liu Chao Drive to his destination earlier. ”

“Bai Mo did not let her go, so Liu Chao could only give up and continue driving. ”
