Translator: 549690339

Ye Zao was clearly the main examiner. wasn’t it just a matter of a few words from ye Zao whether Zheng Wanyin could get into the TRIPLE-A examination?

Was there a need for Zhou Xiang to do this?

Ingrate!

An ingrate! Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Xie wanqiu continued, “Do you need me to say this clearly? Ye Zao is the main examiner. You just need to get ye Zao to give Yinyin a triple-a.” ”

“Mom! Aren’t you asking me to cheat? All assessments are fair and just. What you’re doing is immoral!”Zhou Xiang had never been a person who would bend the rules for personal gain.

“”Immoral? Who are you calling immoral?”Xie wanqiu was so angry that her eyes widened, “I’ve worked so hard to raise you up. It’s fine that I didn’t get to enjoy your blessings for a day, but now I’m even called immoral! Aiyo, my God! Why is my life so miserable!” ”

“Seeing that Xie Wanqiu was about to start crying, zhou xiang hurriedly said, “Mom! I didn’t mean that. I’m not saying that you’re immoral. I just think that cheating is not good. Wan Yin is so outstanding. Even if she doesn’t take shortcuts, I believe that she will definitely get 3A!” ”

“”Wan Yin was raised by me, how can I Not Know Wan Yin is excellent? “Let’s not take shortcuts. What if someone else takes shortcuts and steals Wanyin’s spot?”Xie wanqiu continued, “Wanyin should have gotten this 3A! How can I call this cheating!” ”

“In Xie Wanqiu’s heart, Zheng Wanyin was the most outstanding person in the world. ”

No one could compare to Zheng Wanyin.

Let’s talk about 3A!

“If there were 4A, 5A, and 6a, Zheng Wanyin could still get it! ”

“Zhou Xiang sighed softly. “Mom, other than you, no one will think of using the back door. So, don’t worry. It’s Wanyin’s things. No one can snatch it away.” ”

“Xie wanqiu said angrily, “What you said sounded better than what you sang. What if it’s snatched away! If it’s snatched away, who will be responsible for Wanyin’s future?” ”

“Zhou Xiang said, “Let me put it bluntly. If Wanyin doesn’t get 3A, it can only mean that Wanyin isn’t capable enough.” ”

“Who did you say is not capable enough?”Xie wanqiu was so angry that her lungs were about to explode.

Zhou Xiang actually said that Zheng Wanyin was not capable!

Why was Zheng Wanyin not capable! !

“If she was not her biological aunt, then she was not her biological aunt. Only Zhou Xiang could say something like that. ”

“Zheng Wanyin was such an outstanding person, yet she could actually say that Zheng Wanyin was not capable enough. ”

Look at how she treated ye Zao?

All she did was brag to ye Zao all day long!

How did ye Zao become an assessment officer?

It must be Bai Tang’s handiwork!

“Zhou xiang immediately explained, “Mom, don’t be angry! I’m just making an analogy. I’m just like you. I trust Wanyin very much. She will definitely get 3a.” ”

“I just want to ask you a question. Are you going to tell ye Zao?”

“Zhou Xiang shook her head. “Mom, I really can’t help you with this matter. Besides, I can’t tell Zao either.” ”

Xie wanqiu took a deep breath. “Good! Good! Good! I’ve really raised a good daughter!”

“Mom!”

“”You said you can’t Tell Ye Zao, Right?”Xie wanqiu continued to ask. ”

“Yes.”Zhou Xiang nodded.

“Xie wanqiu said, “Then call ye Zao over. I’ll tell her myself.” ”

“Zhou Xiang was in a difficult position. “Oh my God, Zao Zao is the main assessment officer. You’re Shaoqing’s grandmother. Aren’t you putting her in a difficult position? What if she agrees to you and someone catches her?” ”

“Xie wanqiu continued, “If you don’t Call Ye Zao over today, I Won’t Be Your Mother!” ”

“Zhou Xiang knew Xie Wanqiu’s temper. Helpless, she could only pick up her phone to contact ye Zao. ”

“After receiving Zhou Xiang’s call, ye Zao rushed to the waiting room. ”

“”Auntie, why did you call me here?” ”

Zhou Xiang looked troubled.

“Xie wanqiu said with a smile, “Good girl. Grandma has something to talk to you about.” ”

“What is it? Tell me.”Ye Zao’s voice was shallow.

“Xie wanqiu grabbed ye Zao’s hand. “Zao Zao, you should know that your cousin Wanyin is also participating in the assessment today, right?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Xie wanqiu continued, “Your Cousin Wan Yin is an honest and good child. She doesn’t have any tricks up her sleeve. I’m worried that she won’t be able to outsmart others in terms of scheming, so I would like to ask you to leave the 3A for her!” ”

Cheating?

“Ye Zao hated this kind of thing the most in his life. He frowned slightly, “All of US assessment officers will assess based on our actual standards. Fairness and fairness will never appear to cover up cheating. As long as Wan Yin’s results meet the standards, then the 3A will definitely belong to her. No one can snatch it away from her.” ”

“Xie wanqiu smiled and said, “Don’t worry, burning, Yin Yin’s results will definitely meet the standards. You must help her keep an eye on the 3A. Don’t let it be snatched away by others!” ”
