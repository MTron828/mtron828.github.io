“What’s more, it was to suck du. ”

“Once one encountered Du, there was no possibility of quitting. It was the same as walking towards the end of one’s life. ”

And a drug addict was not qualified to be a descendant of the Lin Family!

“This sentence was not to help Lin ze, but to destroy him with one sentence! ”

“Lin Ze looked up at Feng Qianhua. “Auntie Feng, I don’t understand what you’re saying! I didn’t do anything wrong, why should I apologize to my grandmother? May I know what you’re Thinking?” ”

“As he said that.., lin Ze continued, “I know that you’ve always wanted to marry my father, because I’ve never allowed you to marry into our family. So, you’ve hated me and tried to sow discord in front of my grandmother! You’ve tried every possible way to drive me out of the house! The heavens are watching. Aren’t you afraid of retribution?” ”

Lin Ze’s every sentence was harsh.

“In front of Old Lady Lin, he exposed Feng Qianhua’s ugliest side. ”

But Feng Qianhua was not flustered at all. The corners of her mouth curled up into a proud smile.

“At this time, Lin Ze was still struggling at the brink of death. ”

He would only make old Madam Lin hate him even more!

“Feng Qianhua’s eyes instantly turned red, she said aggrievedly, “Ah Ze, YOU’VE MISUNDERSTOOD ME! I admit that I like your father because we were once engaged! All these years, I never had the delusion of marrying your father. I only wish to be by his side...” ”

Lin Ze’s expression remained the same. “Stop pretending. Do you think I don’t know what you’re Thinking?”

“Feng Qianhua’s face turned pale as she explained, “I didn’t. Ah Ze, you’ve really misunderstood me...” ”

“”Brother Ah Ze! You’ve gone too far! My mother spoke up for you out of goodwill, and you actually wronged her!”Feng Xianxian stood up and said loudly, “I think you’ve sucked so much that your brain is damaged! Now you can’t even differentiate between good and bad!” ”

“You think you can be my sister? In Your Next Life!”

Feng Xianxian held back her tears and pretended to be strong as she looked at Old Mrs. Lin. “Grandma Lin...”

Seeing Feng Qianhua and her daughter being so wronged.

“Old Mrs. Lin’s heart ached terribly. She raised her hand and slapped Lin Ze’s face. “B * Stard! You Didn’t live up to your expectations! You still have to blame others! Get lost! From now on, you’re no longer my grandson!” ”

Lin Ze just stood there with a swollen palm print on his face.

It was very painful.

“But even though his face was in pain, it was no match for the pain in his heart. ”

“Seeing this, Feng Qianhua, Feng Xianxian, and the mother-daughter pair had smug looks on their faces. ”

That’s great!

Old Mrs. Lin was finally going to chase Lin ze out.

They had finally waited for this day.

“Lin Ze looked at Old Mrs. Lin. “Grandma, I didn’t take any DU.” ”

“”The truth is right in front of you, and you still want to deny it?”Old Mrs. Lin was furious. ”

“You don’t believe me?”Lin Ze looked at Old Mrs. Lin with disappointment in his eyes.

Old Mrs. Lin had never seen Lin ze like this before. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

It was very strange.

She was stunned.

“Ever since she was young, this was the first time she had hit Lin Ze. ”

Lin Ze was a very cute child when he was young.

The first words that came out of the mouths of other children were either father or mother.

Only Lin Ze called her grandmother.

“Plus, he was sensible, so out of all the grandchildren, Old Mrs. Lin liked Lin ze the most. ”

But now.

Lin Ze had really disappointed her.

Suck du!

He actually sucked du!

Old Mrs. Lin could tolerate anything except for juniors sucking du.

“Get lost!”Old Mrs. Lin pointed at the door and said.

“”Young master, this is the oven that you asked me to bring...”at this moment, the housekeeper brought in an oven. When he saw this scene, he was stunned on the spot. ”

Lin Ze looked at Old Mrs. Lin and did not explain. He picked up the backpack on the desk and turned to leave.

“Young Master!”The housekeeper shouted anxiously.

“”Housekeeper, don’t call him! Tell him to get lost!”Old Mrs. Lin continued, “This bastard is too bold now. He even dares to touch the poison! In the future, our Lin family will not have such unfilial descendants!” ”

“The housekeeper quickly placed the oven on the ground, “Old Mrs. Lin! You’ve wronged young master. He’s not that kind of person!” ”

“Feng Xianxian walked over and opened the drawer, “Grandpa Housekeeper, it’s not Grandma Lin’s fault this time. It’s brother Ah Ze who went too far! The poison powder is hidden in the drawer. Please don’t excuse him!” ”

There were several bags of white powder-like objects in the drawer.

Two small bags.

And three big bags.

Feng Qianhua looked at this scene in surprise. She didn’t expect Lin Ze to buy so much!

He was too bold!

Old Madam Lin was trembling with anger.

How long had he been using so much poison powder?
