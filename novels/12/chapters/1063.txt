The young peach blossom was burning with splendor.

“Her name was just like this poem, stunning people. ”

“Even Zhao Xueyin, the publicly recognized beauty of the financial world, felt inferior in front of ye Zao. ”

Ye Zao smiled slightly and looked down at Zhao Xueyin. “Thank you.”

“”You’re welcome. Your name is very nice to hear.”Zhao Xueyin continued, “By the way, are you a native of the capital city?” ”

“Sort of.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “What About You?”

“Zhao Xueyin said, “I’m also a native of the capital. However, I don’t live here. I live at the capital’s Prosperity Center.” ”

The capital’s prosperity center belonged to the financial world.

Most of the people who lived there were financial families.

“Zhao Xueyin originally thought that when ye Zhuo heard about the capital’s prosperity center, his expression would more or less change. ”

“However, ye Zhuo’s expression remained indifferent. ”

Could it be that ye Langhua had not told ye Zhuo about the heir?

Zhao Xueyin creased her brows without leaving a trace.

“At this moment, the waiter’s voice sounded in the air. “Customer 0816, please come to the front desk to order.” ”

“Ye Zhuo lowered his eyes to look at the number plate in his hand, then looked at Zhao Xueyin. “I’ll go and order first.” ”

Zhao Xueyin nodded. “Go ahead. I’m number 0817. It should be my turn soon.”

Ye Zhuo went in to order. Zhao Xueyin looked at her back and narrowed her eyes. There was a glimmer in her eyes.

“About twenty minutes later, ye Zhuo walked out. Zhao Xueyin was already waiting outside the door with a packed lunch box. ”

“Ye Zao.”Zhao Xueyin immediately came over to greet him.

Ye Zao was a little surprised. “You haven’t left yet?”

“Zhao xueyin smiled and said, “I don’t have many friends here. It’s boring to walk alone. I just want to wait for you. Let’s chat while we walk.” ”

“”Okay.”Ye Zao’s eyes remained the same. His tone was clear and shallow. “My Friend is in the inpatient department, Building B. What About You?” ”

“Zhao Xueyin followed ye Zao’s footsteps and said with a smile, “What a coincidence! My Friend is also in Ward B! Ye Zao, we are really fated!” ”

“We are indeed fated.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“The two of them walked side by side. Zhao Xueyin was slightly shorter than ye Zao. From her angle, she could just see her snow-white lower jaw, scarlet lips, and the gentle breeze.., zhao Xueyin could even smell the faint fragrance coming from her body. ”

Zhao Xueyin was a perfume lover. She had many top-tier collections of perfume in her house.

“However, this was the first time she smelled this fragrance. ”

It was a very nice fragrance.

It was faintly discernible. It was a bit like the refreshing scent of snow water mixed with the faint fragrance of green bamboo. It made people feel relaxed and relaxed. They could not help but approach her.

“Zhao Xueyin could not help but raise her head and ask, “Ye Zao, what brand of perfume do you use?” ”

“”I don’t use perfume,”ye Zao said. ”

Don’t use perfume? Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Zhao Xueyin’s expression changed slightly.

Where did the fragrance come from without perfume?

“She did not expect ye Zao to be so hypocritical, even though he looked quite calm and collected. ”

“Without perfume, could it be that she could bring her own body fragrance? ”

“However, Zhao Xueyin did not expose ye Zao. She continued, “Then it’s body fragrance! Ye Zao, you’re Amazing! Not only are you beautiful, but you also bring your own body fragrance! There must be a lot of people chasing after you, right?” ”

Which little girl did not like flattery?

“Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Holding hands, we can probably go around the earth three times.” ”

Zhao Xueyin was stunned. She did not understand what ye Zao meant. “What do you mean by go around the Earth three times?”

“”The person who is chasing me,”ye Zao said in a shallow tone. ”

Zhao Xueyin:”...”

He was really not modest!

He was indeed a little girl!

Who would be so narcissistic in a normal person?

“A moment later, Zhao Xueyin came back to her senses. She smiled and said, “You are so beautiful. Not to mention going around the earth three times, even going around the earth thirty times is normal!” ”

“After saying that, Zhao Xueyin continued to ask, “Ye Zao, are you the only child in your family?” ”

She was trying to see if ye Zao would lie to her.

“”I have an older brother,”ye Zao said. ”

He was not lying.

Ye Zao answered practically all of her questions truthfully.

She had only known ye Zao for less than two hours.

Yet Ye Zao was so honest with her.

“This meant that although ye Zao had his own achievements in the technology industry, she was just an idiot in life! ”

Who would be smart enough to treat a stranger like this?

“Thinking of this, Zhao Xueyin’s eyes were full of sarcasm. ”

“Zhao Xue smiled and said, “You’re so good-looking. Your brother must be very handsome, right?” ”
