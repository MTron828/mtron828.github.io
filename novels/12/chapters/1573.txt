“It was the end of the year, and the road to the airport was very congested.”

“In addition, there was a boarding pass to the airport, so they had to leave more than two hours in advance. The flight was at nine o’clock, so it was really not early to leave at six-thirty.”

“”Okay.”Ye Zhuo continued, “Why don’t you come earlier and have breakfast at my place?””

“Sure.”Cen Shaoqing’s tone was low. “Then I’ll be there at six.”

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Are you at home now?””

“I’m at home.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“”Grandma asked me to come and pick you up for dinner.”CEN Shaoqing continued, “Coincidentally, someone came to pay a new year visit today. I’m missing one person in mahjong. Do you want to come?””

“”Sure, come over,”ye Zhuo said.”

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Then I’ll be there in ten minutes.””

“”Okay, I’ll hang up first.””

“After hanging up the phone, ye Zao went to the fitting room and changed into a set of clothes.”

“He was wearing a light yellow woolen coat with a white base coat. He was wearing a pair of black martin boots on his feet. His waist-length hair was evenly draped over the back of his head, and he wore a yellow beret on his head, the color of the hat and the woolen coat complemented each other perfectly.”

“Yellow was a very picky color of skin. If one’s skin was slightly darker, it would be suppressed by this bright color.”

“However, when this color was worn on ye Zao’s body, not only did it not appear dark at all, it contrasted with his already fair skin, which was now even fairer.”

He walked with an imposing aura!

“Ye Zao stood in front of the mirror, slightly curved his lips, and immediately whistled.”

“”TSK, why do I Look So Good!””

“Coincidentally, little white walked in from outside. “What should I do if I look so good?””

“As he finished speaking, little white blocked in front of ye Zao. “Da Zao Zao, don’t look at yourself in the mirror in the future.””

“Why?”Ye Zao had a puzzled look on his face.

“Little White continued, “I read a novel last night. The female lead in it was too beautiful, so when she looked at herself in the mirror, she was so beautiful! What if you were also so beautiful?””

Ye Zao:”...”

“Ten minutes later, ye Zao came downstairs.”

Ye Shu was chatting with Xia Xiaoman.

Ye Zao walked over and greeted her. “Fourth aunt.”

“Xia Xiaoman looked up at Ye Zao. “Zao, are you going out?””

“”Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly and continued, “By the way, Mom, I’m going to South City Tomorrow.””

Ye Shu was stunned. “What are you going to south city for?”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “I’m going with Cen Shaoqing to his aunt’s house to pay new year’s greetings.””

“”Alright.”Ye Shu nodded. “You go ahead. By the way, how many days are you going to be gone? On the tenth day, your first uncle, second uncle, and third uncle will be here!””

“Ye Zhuo said, “Don’t worry. I’ll definitely be back before the tenth day.””

Ye Shu nodded.

“Xia Xiaoman asked curiously, “South city is more than 2,000 kilometers away from the capital, right?””

“”Yes, but it’s also fast by plane. It’ll only take four hours,”ye Zao said.”

“Xia Xiaoman continued, “I’ve passed by the South city several times on business trips, but I haven’t stopped to take a look. The weather there is different from ours. It’s minus 20 degrees Celsius over here, and they’re still wearing short sleeves over there!””

“The south city belonged to the southern city, and it was summer all year round.”

“Ye Shu raised her head to look at ye Zao and continued, “Zao Zao, how many aunts does Shaoqing have in total?”” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“”I think there are two,”ye Zao said. “One is Grandma Cen’s cousin, and the other is his biological sister.””

Ye Shu nodded.

“At this moment, ye Zao’s phone rang.”

“Ye Zao took out his phone and looked at it. “Fourth aunt, Mom, I’m leaving First!””

“Go ahead.”Ye Shu nodded.

Ye Zhuo walked out of the door.

“When he walked out of the door, he saw Cen Shaoqing’s car parked there.”

Cen Shaoqing was leaning against the car door.

“He was still wearing a retro long robe with a long black coat draped over it. The buttons were unbuttoned, and the sunlight shone from behind him, refracting the golden light in the snowy ground. The young master was like Jade, as if he was sparring, as if he was pondering.”

“His posture was casual, but he exuded an aura that could not be ignored.”

“Seeing ye Zhuo walk over, Cen Shaoqing got out of the car, walked to the front passenger seat, and opened the car door.”

“Are you cold?”

“”It’s okay.”Ye Zhuo continued, “Who from your family is coming to pay a new year’s visit today?””

“A distant relative.”Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips opened slightly

“It was said that no one asked about the poor in the busy city, and the rich had distant relatives in the deep mountains. This sentence was not wrong at all. Every year, the CEN family would have many distant relatives come to pay new year’s greetings. Some relatives even had five costumes, and even old lady CEN could not remember.”

“”OH.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly, leaned into the car, and lowered his eyes to fasten his seatbelt.”
