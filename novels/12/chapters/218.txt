Xu Dadong shook his head helplessly.

The little girl was indeed beautiful.

It was a pity.

Her brain was not very sharp.

No wonder there was a saying called a beauty with a bag of straw.

“Xu Dadong did not want to say anything more. He turned to look at Ye Sen and said in a tone that was close to mockery, “Old Ye, then I wish you success in taking down the cooperation case. When the cooperation talks come to an end, remember to treat me to a meal.” ”

“Ye Sen could hear the hidden meaning in these words. He smiled and said, “That’s easy to say.” ”

“Even Xiao Hu, who was by the side, could not hold back his expression. ”

Time passed by minute by minute.

“Soon, it was three o’clock. ”

Toaeon gave each company five minutes.

“If they wanted to secure the cooperation case, they had to use these five minutes to the fullest. ”

They could not waste a second.

Ye Sen and the others were ranked 20th.

“Ye Zhuo took the cooperation case. “Uncle, I’ll be in charge of telling them in a while. Now, tell me briefly about our advantages.” ”

Ye Sen nodded and told ye Zhuo about the professional knowledge related to the express delivery industry.

Xiao Hu’s heart was beating fast as he listened by the side.

“He heard that the employees of TOAEON company all spoke English. Could Ye Zhuo, a child, really do it? Don’t get chased out before you even open your mouth! ”

It was also ye Sen’s fault that he had a big heart!

He still let her mess around.

“”Please invite the person-in-charge of Shengdong Express Company in.”At this moment, the assistant of Toaeon Company opened the door of the meeting room. ”

“Although ye Sen did not know much English, he still knew simple everyday language. ”

“”Zao Zao, let’s Go in.” ”

“Ye Zao looked back at ye Sen. “Uncle, don’t be nervous.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Sen pretended to be calm and nodded.

Xiao Hu followed behind the two of them.

“After the three of them entered, the door of the conference room was closed. ”

“In front of the oval-shaped conference table sat a middle-aged man with blonde hair and blue eyes. He looked kind, but in fact, his eyes were shining with shrewdness. ”

Such a person was the hardest to fool.

“The assistant took the initiative to introduce, “Hello, President Ye. This is Mr. Embert, the vice president of our Toaeon.” ”

“”Hello, Mr. Embert! I’m Ye Sen, the person in charge of Shengdong Express delivery. This is my niece, Ye Zhuo. Next, she will represent me to discuss the cooperation with you.”Ye Sen finished the sentence in one breath. ”

“He had practiced this sentence in front of the mirror for a few days. Fortunately, he did not make a mistake. ” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Embert looked at his assistant.

“The assistant immediately understood and said, “Let’s begin.” ”

“Ye Zhuo stood up from the chair, inserted the USB flash drive that he had prepared beforehand into the computer, connected it to the big screen behind him, and began to explain the plan. ”

Her voice was very pleasant to hear.

It was a very standard London accent.

“Embert, who was originally a little disinterested, suddenly looked up at Ye Zao and narrowed his eyes. ”

Embert had already looked at the plans of more than a dozen companies.

But none of them could arouse his interest.

They were all the same.

“But in Ye Zao’s plan, he saw something different. ”

Other companies focused on the future.

But ye Zao focused on benefits.

What did businessmen value the most?

Benefits!

“Moreover, not only did ye Zao talk about benefits, he also reasonably analyzed the future situation of Shengdong Company. ”

“Ye Sen and Xiao Hu looked at ye Zao, who was standing there talking with confidence, and were stunned. ”

“Originally, Xiao Hu was still worried that ye Zao could speak English. ”

“He did not expect that not only did ye Zao speak English so well, but his professional knowledge was also amazing. ”

Such temperament!

Such conversation!

How was he like a child!

Xiao Hu was really shocked.

He did not believe ye Zao before.

“Now, he wished he could kneel on the ground and call him daddy! ”

“”Your Shengdong Company is just a small and unknown company. Wind Speed Company, Mingde company, their scale is bigger than yours!”Mr. Embert suddenly said, “What reason do you have for me to choose your company?” ”

“Ye Zao smiled slightly, he said slowly, “Because I believe that Mr. Embert is not a person who only cares about appearance. If you really think that wind speed and mingde are worthy of cooperation, then there would not be today’s tender meeting.” ”

“After saying that.., ye Zao continued, “Moreover, all the big companies came from small companies. Just like your company, your company only had six employees at one time during the most difficult time. It has only been twelve years, and your company has already developed into one of the few big companies. This shows that size is not equal to strength! Your company values strength, and will certainly leave the opportunity to those who are prepared!” ”

Ye Zhuo’s words were too beautiful.

It also directly spoke to Embert’s heart.
