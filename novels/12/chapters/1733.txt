“Chapter 1734: 358: I’ll Be Frank, I’m from 200 years later, the jealous Master Wu! 2”

“Like teacher, like disciple.”

“Since professor Feng could betray, so could her disciple!”

“Before roping professor Feng in, Camilla had investigated Liu Yuan.”

“Most importantly, Gu Si’s birth was also very ordinary. Although she had a house and a car in the capital, the price of a house in the capital was too expensive, causing her to struggle until now and only buy a two-bedroom apartment.”

“Gu Si’s family also had her parents, a younger brother, and a younger sister. The two-bedroom apartment, which was 70 square meters, was a little too crowded for the whole family.”

“Therefore, relatively speaking, the chances of winning Gu si over were higher than the others.”

“Liu Yuan?”Dr. Cara asked.

“”Yes.”Jamila nodded, “Gu si is not only Feng Qi’s favorite disciple. She has participated in the aircraft carrier project and won many awards. “Most importantly, because of Feng Qi’s sudden departure, she also has a lot of opinions about ye Zao. Due to her financial situation and external reasons, it’s much easier to rope her in.””

“Dr. Cara nodded and pressed the cigarette butt into the ashtray. He turned to look at Jamila and continued, “Then I’ll leave this matter to you.””

“Jamila stood up straight. “Don’t worry, I’ll definitely live up to your expectations!””

“Okay.”Dr. Cara nodded in satisfaction. “I look forward to your triumphant return.”

...

On the other side.

At the Capital University.

“It was already autumn, and the maple leaves on both sides of the road had turned golden.”

“The autumn wind blew, and the Golden Maple leaves fluttered in the wind. They landed on the ground, forming a thick carpet. The ground was soft, and the scenery was as beautiful as a dream.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“On the busy Wutong Avenue, a couple with their fingers interlocked walked on the small path covered with Golden Wutong leaves.”

The man was extraordinarily handsome. He was tall and had long legs. His entire body exuded a domineering aura that looked down on the world.

“The girl’s eyes were as clear as a painting. She was graceful and charming. She was clearly facing the sky, but her beauty was soul-stirring.”

“When the two of them walked together, even if they did not do anything, they were already in the painting. Everything around them became their backdrop.”

“Passersby turned to look at the prime minister, their eyes filled with amazement.”

“Although there was no shortage of beauties and handsome men in life, such a combination of beauties and handsome men was rare. Even an idol drama might not be able to produce such an effect.”

“”Leader,”Cen Shaoqing held ye Zao’s hand tightly. “What season do you like best?””

“”Winter.”Ye Zao raised his eyes slightly and continued, “What About You?””

“In the past, Cen Shaoqing had no feelings for the four seasons.”

“He would not be sad about spring and autumn, nor would he have any feelings during the two seasons of winter and summer.”

“But now, it was different from before.”

A moment later.

“Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads and slowly said, “I like early summer.””

“Early summer?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyes slightly.

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “I like winter because of the world I used to live in. Due to the excessive development of human civilization, resources were exhausted, glaciers melted, and global warming. There is only one season in the entire earth. “I’ve only seen winter and snow in history books and on TV.””

“At this point, Ye Zao looked up at Cen Shaoqing and said seriously, “Cen Shaoqing, have I told you before? I’m not the real ye Zao. I’m from 2221 AD in the future, which is 200 years later.””

Couples should not have secrets.

Ye Zhuo thought for a long time and decided to tell Cen Shaoqing his secret.

“Unexpectedly, Cen Shaoqing was not surprised at all when he heard this. Instead, a faint smile appeared on the corner of his lips. He looked down at ye Zhuo and said, “I know.””

“”You know?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly, and his eyes were full of surprise.”

“How do you know?”Ye Zhuo continued to ask.

“Have you ever heard of a saying?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“Ye Zao said, “What is it?””

“Cen Shaoqing leaned over slightly and whispered into her ear, “A man who knows his wife is like a husband.””

“It was a very simple word, but it made ye Zao’s heart beat faster.”

“”Mr. Cen, please have some face!”Ye Zao reached out and pinched his face. “When did I agree to marry you?””

“”I don’t care. In any case, I won’t marry Miss Ye in this life.”Cen Shaoqing squeezed her hand.”

Ye Zhuo smiled faintly. “Some people even said that they would never marry.”

“”Then it’s the same if you marry me.”CEN Shaoqing continued, “As long as uncle and aunt agree, I can marry at any time.””

There were some things that had to be experienced before they would be engraved in one’s heart.
