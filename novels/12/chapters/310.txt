Translator: 549690339

“Besides the sound of the wind and waves,. ”

Ye Zhuo could hear his breathing the most clearly.

It was shallow.

But it was deeply rooted in people’s hearts.

“At this moment, Cen Shaoqing suddenly opened his eyes. ”

“Caught off guard, the two pairs of eyes met. ”

Sparks flew in all directions.

The atmosphere fell into a delicate state.

Both of them were stunned.

“Ye Zhuo was the first to react. He tried his best to act as if nothing had happened. “Fifth brother, I need to go back and take a shower. Give me the car keys.” ”

“You know how to drive?”Cen Shaoqing looked indifferent.

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

Cen Shaoqing handed the keys to her. “Drive slowly.”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo took the keys. “I’ll be back soon.”

The sea breeze whistled.

Cen Shaoqing looked at her back and could not tell if it was the wind or his heart.

It was also at this moment.

Cen Shaoqing suddenly remembered that only when he thought of ye Zhuo did he lose control of his emotions. His heart raced and he could not breathe.

“He took out his phone, opened his social media site, and posted a post: [ why do I suddenly feel like my heart is racing and I can’t breathe when I see a person? Am I Sick? ] ”

“No one replied to the post for a long time, so Cen Shaoqing set the reward of three gold coins. ”

“As soon as he set the reward, someone replied: ”

“[ Congratulations, your Big Brother Dei! You are sick, and you are very sick. The name of your illness is lovesickness! It seems that your big brother Dei is very sick! ] ”

“[ the person who makes your heart race and you can’t breathe must be a girl, right? ] ”

“[ OP, are you in love with her? ] ”

[ and it’s the kind of love that you can’t extricate yourself from! ]

[ OP’s spring is here! ]

Cen Shaoqing looked at these replies and frowned slightly.

He was in love with ye Zao?

Love?

Does loving someone make your heart beat faster and you can’t breathe?

Cen Shaoqing opened the search engine again and typed in a sentence: [ does loving someone make your heart beat faster? ]

Many people had asked this question.

One of the answers had the highest number of likes: [ Yes! Of course... You Will Blush and your mind will go blank! ]

“[ not only will your heart beat faster, in the dead of night, you will also think of her and dream of her. When you see other members of the opposite sex, you will unconsciously compare yourself to her! ] ”

“[ and besides her, you will not find any members of the opposite sex pleasing to the eye! I wish the two of you can get together as soon as possible and step into the Hall of Love! ] ” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Looking at these answers, Cen Shaoqing twirled the prayer beads. ”

Could it be...

That he really fell in love with ye Zao?

“The answers on the Internet might not be true, right? ”

While he was thinking.

The sound of a car engine rang in his ears.

Cen Shaoqing raised his eyes slightly and saw ye Zao getting out of the car.

He was wearing a simple white shirt.

It was paired with black trousers.

“His aura was very strong, and there was a sense of valor in his cold demeanor. ”

“His half-wet hair was draped behind his head, and the sea breeze blew gently, forming a messy beauty. ”

“His white face was not covered with makeup, but it was so beautiful that it was insolent. ”

“I brought you a bottle of coke.”Ye Zao threw the coke in his hand to Cen Shaoqing.

Cen Shaoqing reached out and took it. “Thank you.”

Ye Zao walked directly to the other side of the beach umbrella and lay down on the chair. He opened the cap of the Coke bottle and drank half of the ice coke in one go.

Cen Shaoqing also unscrewed the cap and drank a mouthful of coke.

The Iced Coke was very stimulating to the taste buds.

The taste was not particularly bad.

Cen Shaoqing actually drank an entire bottle of coke without realizing it.

“At this time, he had already forgotten that he never drank anything other than tea and plain water. ”

He did not even drink coffee.

“If this was seen by others, they would probably be dumbfounded. ”

“The Sun had gradually set in the west. The clouds in the Sky had turned golden, covering the entire sky and reflecting on the sea surface, making the entire sea surface golden. ”

“The sea and sky were the same color. The fiery red sunset was right on that line. Occasionally, a few seagulls would fly by, adding some color to the beautiful scene in front of them. ”

The entire scene looked very spectacular.

“Ye Zhuo lay on the chair and couldn’t help but sigh, “It’s so beautiful!” ”

This was something she couldn’t see in that world.

Cen Shaoqing lifted his eyelids slightly and looked at the sea. The scenery was indeed not bad.

“Ye Zhuo.”

Cen Shaoqing opened his mouth slowly and said in a low voice.

“HMM?”

“Do you have someone you like?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“No.”Ye Zhuo looked back in confusion. “Why did you suddenly ask this question?”

Cen Shaoqing’s gaze fell on the horizon in front of him. His deep eyes could not see the bottom. “I’m a little curious. What does it feel like to like someone?”was the answer really the same as those on the internet?
