As long as ye Langhua took out the gold mine map in her hand.

“Not to mention one XI Empire Group, even ten XI empire groups could be saved! ”

“However, Xi Muwen’s phone was not picked up because he was busy with company matters, while Yang Jiao’s phone was not picked up because she was busy playing mahjong. ”

“When XI Muwen returned and saw Yang Jiao playing mahjong, he was so angry that his temples were throbbing. However, due to the presence of outsiders, he could not flare up directly. ”

“At the Mahjong Table, Mrs. Wang turned to look at Yang Jiao. “Yang Jiao, I think there’s something wrong with your elder Mu’s expression! Why don’t we end this game?” ”

“Yang Jiao rolled her eyes. “Don’t worry about him!”She had not played two games in a long time. Now that they had finally played one game, she still had to look at Xi Muwen’s expression? ”

“Mrs. Li chimed in, “I think Mrs. Wang is right. Let’s leave as soon as we finish this round!” ”

“This group of rich ladies were used to being flattered by others, so they could not stand the slightest hint of looks. ”

“”Right, right, right, let’s finish this card quickly!” ”

“Yang Jiao frowned slightly, feeling a little unhappy. ”

Xi Muwen came to the door of Jiang Yan’s room.

“Ye Langhua spent most of her time with Jiang Yan, and today was no exception. ”

“After sorting out his emotions, Xi Muwen reached out to knock on the door. ”

“Very soon, the door opened. ”

“Jiang Yan saw Xi Muwen and asked in surprise, “Father, why are you back now?” ”

“Xi Muwen could not be bothered to deal with Jiang Yan, so he asked directly, “Where’s Your Mother?” ”

“Jiang Yan said, “My mother? My mother seems to have gone out for something!” ”

“”Call your mother and tell her to hurry back!”Xi Muwen called ye Langhua, but ye Langhua did not pick up. ”

“Okay.”Jiang Yan nodded and immediately picked up her phone to make a call.

“A moment later, she put down her phone. “My mother is probably busy! She didn’t pick up the call!” ”

“Xi Muwen frowned, and he already had a bad feeling. “When did she leave? Did she say where she was going when she left?” ”

Jiang Yan shook her head. “I’m not too sure either!”

Xi Muwen’s frown deepened.

“”Xi Muwen, who are you trying to show your ugly face to! It wasn’t easy for me to invite Mrs. Wang and Mrs. Li over for a round of Mahjong, and you even scared them away!”Yang Jiao’s voice came from behind. ”

Xi Muwen tried his best to suppress the anger in his heart. “Where’s Ye Langhua?”

“She went out in the morning. She said something happened!”Yang Jiao said.

“Where did she go?”Xi Muwen followed up with a question.

“Yang Jiao was speechless. “How would I know! Her legs are on her body, but not mine!” ”

“Trash! I think you’re trash! You Can’t even control a person!”Xi Muwen was furious!

“”What’s wrong with you?”After she said this, Yang Jiao realized something was wrong and quickly asked, “Did something happen?” ” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Xi Muwen threw the documents in his briefcase to Yang Jiao. “Look at it yourself!”

“After Yang Jiao finished reading the documents, she was so scared that her face turned pale. “What’s going on?” ”

“Xi muwen continued, “The most important thing now is to find ye Langhua immediately!” ”

“At this moment, the maid brought Yang Jiao’s phone over. “Madam, your phone has been ringing for a long time!” ”

Yang Jiao took the phone and saw that it was XI weiyue calling. Her expression softened.

“”Hello, Weiyue! Are you at the Shunxi Corporation Now?” ”

Yang Jiao’s face turned pale. “What? !”

Xi Muwen realized something was wrong and snatched Yang Jiao’s phone away. “What happened to Weiyue?”

“What? !”Xi Muwen was stunned as well.

“First, there was a sudden incident at Xi Empire, and now, Xi Weiyue’s identity as the heir had been revoked! ”

“Then, ye Langhua disappeared for no reason! ”

“Was all this a coincidence, or was ye Langhua doing it on purpose? ”

“Xi Muwen was panicking inside, but he still tried his best to calm himself down. “Weiyue, don’t worry, I’m already contacting ye Langhua!” ”

“”Dad, hurry up then.” ”

“”Okay, don’t worry.” ”

“After comforting XI Weiyue, Xi Muwen hung up the phone and turned to Jiang Yan. “Call ye Langhua again! Until you get through!” ”

“Okay.”Jiang Yan nodded.

“Yang Jiao said, “Old Mu, don’t worry too much, Jiang Yan is still here! Ye Langhua has been looking for her for half a month and thirty-six years, could it be that she doesn’t even want her own daughter anymore? In addition, she even told me in the morning that she was very grateful to US and didn’t know how to repay us. Both her words and words had the intention of giving us the blueprint. I believe that she wouldn’t disappear for no reason!” ”
