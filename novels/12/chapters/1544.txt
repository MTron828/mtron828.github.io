Zhang Qingqing bit her lip and didn’t say anything.

“An lizi continued, “I think the most important thing now is how to handle this matter!” ”

“Zhang Qingqing wiped her tears. “If I knew how to handle this matter, I wouldn’t have come looking for you! Lizi, what should I do now?” ”

“At this point, Zhang Qingqing hugged an Lizi and burst into tears. ”

“An Lizi had never experienced such a thing before. She thought for a moment and continued, “Qingqing, you and Ah Ze are still young. It’s definitely too early to be parents. How about...” ”

“Zhang Qingqing raised her head to look at an lizi and asked, “Are you saying that you want me to abort the child?” ”

“”Yes.”An Lizi nodded. “Qingqing, your life has just begun and you haven’t graduated from college yet. It’s not a good thing for you to have a child now...” ”

“”I don’t want to have a child at a time like this!”! “But what can I do! ?”! “Look at the report again. The Doctor said that my constitution is special and I’m not suitable for an abortion. If I abort this child, I won’t have another child in the future!” ”

An Lizi was stunned. She lowered her head and looked at the report. Her face was slightly pale.

“Zhang Qingqing continued, “If it was really that easy to solve, I wouldn’t have looked for you! Lizi... You are my only friend in Beijing. What should I do?” ” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

An Lizi sighed.

She did not know what to do now!

She was stuck in a dilemma.

She couldn’t let Zhang Qingqing lose the right to be a mother at such a young age.

“But if she was born, it would be too unfair to Lin Ze and Zhang Qingqing! ”

“”I don’t want to trouble Lin Ze, but I can’t let my child lose his father after he’s born!”Zhang Qingqing continued, “Lin Ze is also a child who grew up in a single-parent family. I Can’t let my child go through the same experience as him!” ”

It was precisely because Lin ze was a child who grew up in a single-parent family that Zhang Qingqing was so certain that Lin Ze would not abandon him.

“As a child who grew up in a single-parent family, Lin Ze knew how difficult it was for a child to stand in an environment without a mother or father. Therefore, Lin Ze definitely could not bear to let their child go through such a thing. ”

“An Lizi was stunned. After a moment, she continued, “Then what do you plan to do now?” ”

“”I don’t know.”Zhang Qingqing shook her head, her face full of helplessness. ”

An Lizi sighed.

What to do?

What else could she do now?

“Zhang Qingqing couldn’t abort the child, and she didn’t want the child to grow up in a single-parent family. So, she could only let Lin Ze take charge. ”

“Does ah ze know about this?”An Lizi continued to ask.

“Not yet.”Zhang Qingqing shook her head. “I didn’t tell him. You’re the first person to know about this.”

An Lizi looked around. “The hospital isn’t a place to talk either. Let’s go back first.”

“Okay.”Zhang Qingqing followed an Lizi’s footsteps.

The two of them arrived at a coffee shop.

“An Lizi was just about to order a cup of coffee for Zhang Qingqing, but when she thought that it would be bad for the child if a pregnant person drank coffee, she ordered a cup of hot milk for her. ”

“Soon, the milk and coffee were served on the table. ”

“Zhang Qingqing took a sip of the milk, then, she said, “Lizi, the child in my belly is your nephew no matter what. You Can’t just leave him to die. I know that Lin Ze doesn’t like me, and I’m not worthy of him. But now that things have already happened, escaping is not the way... “...”. “...” ”

“An Lizi felt that this matter was somewhat unbelievable. She looked at Zhang Qingqing, she asked very seriously, “Qingqing, let me ask you again. Are you sure that Ah Ze is the child’s father? Don’t lie to me! Let me tell you, no one in the Lin family is to be trifled with. If you dare to set them up, you won’t have a good ending!” ”

“Not to mention the others, just ye Zao alone would not have an easy time. ”

“”I’m sure!”Zhang Qingqing continued, “If you don’t believe me, we can confront Lin ze face-to-face! He is the child’s father. He can’t possibly not feel anything about what happened that night!” ”

“Seeing Zhang Qingqing nodding her head with certainty, the doubts in an Lizi’s heart were dispelled a little. ”

“She had known Zhang Qingqing since she was young. Although Zhang Qingqing was a gold digger and wanted to marry into a wealthy family, she wasn’t a bad person. Logically speaking, she shouldn’t be able to do such a thing. Moreover, she even dared to confront Lin Ze. ”

“If Lin Ze really didn’t do anything, Zhang Qingqing shouldn’t be so confident! ”

“”Okay, I believe you!”An lizi nodded and continued, “Ah Ze is a responsible boy. If, I mean if, if this child is really his, then I believe that he won’t be irresponsible.” ”
