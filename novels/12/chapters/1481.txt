“Chapter 1482: 315: burning with power, the father you can’t afford to mess with! 1”

“After saying that, Jin Yuyan handed her assistant a seal.”

This was the exclusive seal of the Royal Princess of Korea.

“As long as ye Zhuo saw this seal, he would know that she was not a liar.”

Normal people would not reject this heaven-splashing wealth.

“Therefore, Ye Zhuo must have thought that she was a liar, which was why he repeatedly rejected her invitation.”

“The assistant reached out and took the seal. “Yes, Princess. I’ll go now.””

Jin Yuyan nodded. “Hurry up and go.”

The assistant came to the training ground again.

Ye Zao was teaching Bai Xiaosu blind fighting techniques.

She was tall and a head taller than Bai Xiaosu. She held Bai Xiaosu’s hand from behind. “Are you aiming for the center?”

“Yes.”Bai Xiaosu nodded.

“”Three, two, one!”Ye Zhuo pulled the trigger.”

“Bang!”

The bullet broke out of the gun’s barrel and directly shot into the Red Bull’s eye.

Jin Yuyan’s assistant had just walked over when she saw this scene.

A look of surprise flashed across her eyes.

This miss ye was really too amazing.

“She could hit almost wherever she pointed, hitting every target.”

No Wonder Jin Yuyan wanted her to change her nationality at all costs.

“A moment later, the assistant walked to the side and said respectfully, “Miss Ye.””

Ye Zao looked back slightly. “Is there anything else?”

“The assistant looked at ye Zao and continued, “Miss Ye, can I have a word with you?””

“Ye Zao said, “I think I know what you want to say. Go back and tell your princess that I thank her for her love. I was born a Chinese and die a Chinese soul. I will never change my nationality.””

“In fact, ye Zao had encountered such a thing many times in his previous life.”

“If she had agreed to change her nationality, she would not be Chinese now.”

“The assistant was stunned for a moment and then said, “Miss Ye, this is the seal that our princess asked me to show you. Don’t worry, we are definitely not swindlers.””

“As he said that, the assistant took out the seal.”

The golden seal shone under the sunlight. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Ye Zao’s expression remained the same. “I’ve already said what I should have said.”

“”Miss Ye, we’re really not liars!”The assistant thought that ye Zao still thought that they were liars.”

He thought the same as Jin Yuyan. Almost no one could resist such a temptation.

“Therefore, ye Zao must have misunderstood them.”

“”Sir, I think you might have misunderstood. I know that you’re not a liar. I’ll say it again. Please go back and tell your princess.””

“At this point, the assistant couldn’t say anything more. He bowed and turned to leave.”

“After the assistant left, Bai Xiaosu asked curiously, “Miss Ye, is that person the assistant of the Royal Princess of Korea, Jin Yuyan?””

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Bai Xiaosu continued, “Jin Yuyan wants you to change your nationality and participate in the shooting competition?””

“Yes.”

Bai Xiaosu clicked his tongue. “This Jin Yuyan is quite political-minded. She also has a good eye for people!”

“If ye Zao could be poached by Jin Yuyan, he would definitely make a huge contribution to Korea.”

“Not to mention, ye Zao would definitely take first place in this shooting competition.”

“If it were anyone else, Bai Xiaosu would be a little worried and would not be able to resist the temptation.”

But who was ye Zao?

How could she betray her nationality for the sake of some power and benefits?

“Ye Zao did not seem to take this matter to heart. He picked up his gun and said, “Let’s continue.””

“Okay.”Bai Xiaosu nodded.

The two of them held their guns and continued to practice.

Bai Xiaosu had a good foundation and was smart. Ye Zao was also very skilled in teaching.

On the other side.

“Jin Yuyan waited for a long time. Finally, her assistant came back.”

She thought that she would see her assistant bring ye Zao along.

She didn’t expect that the assistant would come back alone.

“Jin Yuyan walked over and said first, “Why didn’t miss ye come back with you?””

The assistant looked a little troubled. “Miss ye asked me to give you a message.”

“What message?”Jin Yuyan asked.

“The assistant continued, “Miss Ye said thank you for your love for her. However, she was born in China and died in China.””

“What?”Jin Yuyan was stunned.

“So, Ye Zhuo was still unwilling to change his nationality?”

How could this be?

“As the eldest princess of Korea, Jin Yuyan cherished talented people very much and was desperate for talents. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have given such good conditions, such as nationality, surname, and noble status.”

“If it were anyone else, they would not have received such treatment!”

“However, Jin Yuyan did not expect that ye Zhuo would still reject such a generous and superior condition.”
