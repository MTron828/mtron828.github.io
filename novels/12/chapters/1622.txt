“Seeing Tang mi like this, Xiao Qing didn’t know whether to cry or laugh! ”

Was this child stupid?

“At this time, she wasn’t in a hurry at all. Instead, she was eating and drinking well. ”

“”Her mother, are you not feeling well? Hurry up and eat! It’ll be cold soon!”Tang Shengli looked at Xiao Qing curiously. ”

“Xiao Qing was a little speechless and said, “You two are just like Father and daughter! How can you still eat at this time!” ”

“Tang shengli smiled and said, “I know you’re worried about the aircraft carrier plan. What’s there to worry about? There’s always something in life, but there’s always something in life. If we really fail, then it’s our daughter’s life! “Little girl, am I Right?”At the end of her sentence.., tang Shengli turned to look at Tang Mi. ”

Tang mi nodded. “Yes! My dad is right!”

Xiao Qing shook his head helplessly. How were they father and daughter? They were simply two children that made people worry!

“Tang mi smiled and said, “So, Mom, don’t worry too much! There’s nothing to worry about!” ”

The next day.

Tang Xue arrived at the office early in the morning. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Just as she arrived, someone knocked on the office door. ”

“Come in.”

The door was pushed open in a flash.

Old Nie walked in from outside.

“Nie Gong!”Tang Xue raised her head slightly.

“Old Nie placed the things in his hands on the office desk. “Miss Tang, this is the bird’s nest that my wife brought back from country l. I heard that this thing is very good for girls, so my wife specially asked me to bring these over to give to you!” ”

“”Nie Gong, you’re too polite!”Tang Xue immediately stood up from her chair. “I can’t take this.” ”

“Old Nie said, “Miss Tang, you must accept it! You’ve been kind to our family! Not to mention a few boxes of bird’s nest, even if you want me to go down a mountain of knives and into the Sea of fire, I won’t even frown!” ”

“”Nie Gong, you’re exaggerating!” ”

“Old Nie looked at Tang Xue, then he said, “Miss Tang, if it weren’t for the fact that you don’t mind me, I would still be in Area C of ye Zao! “After the aircraft carrier project is declared a failure, then I can only stay at home and drink northwest wind! “But it’s different now. Now, not only can I continue to work in the base, after I retire, I can even get a decent retirement salary!” ”

“Many people were secretly envious of old nie, regretting not leaving with him back then. ”

“Old Nie was also very glad that he made the right choice back then. At the same time, he was very grateful to Tang Xue. If it weren’t for Tang Xue, he wouldn’t have gotten to where he was today! ”

“”Nie Gong, you’re a talented person. It’s my honor to be able to invite you to my Tang family’s laboratory. If you want to say thank you, I should be the one thanking you!”Tang Xue continued, “Actually, you should be thanking yourself the most. As far as I know, there are many people in Area C who are regretting not choosing to come out with you back then. This shows that you have foresight and boldness!”! “Not everyone can have your boldness!” ”

“Tang Xue’s eloquence was very good. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have been so popular in the base. ”

Old Nie felt very comfortable listening to these words. He felt that he had made the right choice back then!

“”Miss Tang, no matter what, I still have to thank you! Please accept these bird’s nests,”said old nie, old Nie seemed to have thought of something and said worriedly, “Oh right, Miss Tang, I heard that Ye Zhuo has signed a gambling agreement with C nation. From now on, the management rights of the CEN family’s base will no longer belong to the Cen Family!” ”

“Old Nie was worried that if C Nation took over the Cen family’s base, it would affect him! ”

What if C Nation and a few other countries carried out a big purge of the base? What would he do then?

“Tang Xue also saw old Nie’s doubts and said with a smile, “Nie Gong, I can’t guarantee anything else, but please rest assured that as long as they are members of our Tang family’s laboratory, they will not be affected!” ”

“Really?”Old Nie asked in disbelief.

“I don’t need to lie to you about such things!”

“Old Nie excitedly bowed to tang xue and said, “Miss Tang, then thank you!” ”

“”You’re welcome,”Tang Xue said. ”

“After bowing, old nie continued, “Miss Tang, do you know China?” ”

“Yes.”Tang Xue did not hide anything.

“Old Nie said excitedly, “I knew that a truly talented person would not be buried no matter where he went! Miss Tang, I’ll leave it to you to take care of him in the future!” ”

“Tang Xue nodded. “Don’t worry, worker nie. I definitely won’t mistreat the members of our Tang family’s laboratory.” ”

“Ten minutes later, old Nie walked out of Tang Xue’s office. ”
