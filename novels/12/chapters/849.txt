“Chapter 850: 186: losing to an opponent like Miss Ye, I’m completely convinced! 4”

Translator: 549690339

Cen Yuyan cried until she was out of breath. “But I only like him.”

“Song Chenyu patted Cen Yuyan’s back. “Yuyan, don’t cry anymore.” ”

“I’m just a little unwilling.”

“Song Chenyu narrowed his eyes and continued, “Actually, losing to an opponent like miss ye isn’t shameful.” ”

Cen Yuyan sniffed and raised her head to look at Song Chenyu. “It’s not ye Zao.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

It’s not ye Zao?

A hint of panic flashed across song Chenyu’s eyes.

Could it be...

Lu Xiu had told Cen Yuyan the truth?

But Lu Xiu had clearly promised her to keep it a secret.

“Song Chenyu tried his best to calm himself down and continued, “If it’s not Miss Ye, then who is it? Could it be that Lu Xiu likes someone else?” ”

“”En.”Cen Yuyan nodded. “I’m not sure who exactly it is. I asked Lu Xiu, but he refused to tell me. He only said that the person wasn’t Ye Zhuo.” ”

Cen Yuyan really couldn’t figure out what kind of woman was so captivating that Lu Xiu even rejected her.

Song Chenyu heaved a sigh of relief.

She knew that Lu Xiu wouldn’t betray her.

“”Lu Xiu said this probably to protect Miss Ye, right?” ”

Cen Yuyan looked at song Chenyu with a puzzled expression.

“Song Chenyu continued, “Miss Ye is fifth master’s boyfriend after all, and you’re Fifth Master’s fourth sister. You and Miss Ye will become a family in the future. Lu Xiu is a very responsible person. He won’t let his love become a burden to others. “He once told me that he would devote his entire life to protect the person he likes. As long as he sees her happy, it’s fine.” ”

Cen Yuyan’s lungs were about to explode from anger.

“Did he really say that?”

“Song Chenyu looked at Cen Yuyan. “Yuyan, when have I ever lied to You?” ”

“Not only did song Chenyu not lie to her, he also never lied. ”

Cen Yuyan did not expect that she would still lose to ye Zhuo in the end.

What right did ye Zhuo have?

What right did she have to make Lu Xiu Pay?

“Ye Zhuo! I hate her to death!”Cen Yuyan almost screamed.

It was all ye Zao’s fault!

“If it were not for ye Zao, she would have been with Lu Xiu by now. ”

“Song Chenyu comforted Cen Yuyan. “Yuyan, don’t be like this. It’s hard to say if you like this kind of thing, just like how you like Lu Xiu. Moreover, Miss ye is indeed very outstanding. Otherwise, why do all men like her so much?” ”

“When she said the last sentence, a hint of jealousy flashed in song Chenyu’s eyes that was difficult to detect. ”

That’s right.

She was very jealous of Ye Zhuo.

“In her opinion, other than that face, ye Zhuo was completely useless. ”

But Cen Shaoqing treated ye Zhuo as a treasure.

What right did ye Zhuo have?

She had known Cen Shaoqing for many years.

“At that time, even Zhou Xiang recognized her. ”

And Now?

“Although Zhou Xiang did not seem to have changed much, in fact, her attitude toward her was completely different from before. ”

All these changes were because of ye Zao.

If it was not for ye Zao.

She would be the future mistress of the CEN family.

“Cen Yuyan was so angry that she gritted her teeth. “Wait! Ye Zao, just you wait! Sooner or later, I will let our family see her true colors!” ”

“Seeing Cen Yuyan like this, Song Chenyu curled her lips slightly. ”

It seemed that ye Zao was not far away from getting out of the Cen family.

“The position of Cen family’s matriarch, aside from her. ”

No one could even think of touching it!

“Thinking of this, song Chenyu narrowed his eyes, and a look of determination flashed across his eyes. ”

“Song Chenyu looked at Cen Yuyan and said with a smile, “Miss ye is indeed a person of great talent. Yuyan, your prejudice against her is too deep. To be honest, I’m completely convinced that I lost to an opponent like Miss Ye.” ”

“Cen Yuyan snorted coldly. “Chenyu, your heart is too good. Even a fly wouldn’t bite a seamless egg! If ye Zao didn’t deliberately seduce Lu Xiu, how could Lu Xiu fall in love with her!” ”

What was so good about ye Zao?

“Song Chenyu smiled and patted Cen Yuyan’s hand, “Yuyan, you shouldn’t have such a deep prejudice against Miss Ye. After all, Miss Ye wants to become a family with you. If you continue to have such a deep prejudice against Miss Ye, it won’t be of any benefit to you. “I see that your family treats miss ye very well.” ”

“”Isn’t it all because of my grandmother?”In Cen Yuyan’s view, it was all old Madam Cen’s fault. “Shaoqing didn’t like ye Zhuo to begin with, but my grandmother had to blindly get involved! She’s already old, can’t she take care of herself properly?” ”

“It was one thing for old Madam Cen to be deceived by Ye Zhuo, but now, she had even implicated the entire family into being deceived by Ye Zhuo. ”

Old Mrs. Cen was simply a sinner of the CEN family.

“Old Mrs. Cen is old. Everything she does is for the sake of the future generations. Don’t blame her.”

“It was fine if song Chenyu did not say this, but once song Chenyu said this, Cen Yuyan became even angrier. ”

For the sake of the future generations?

“If Old Mrs. Cen was thinking for the sake of the future generations, she would not be so muddle-headed. ”

“”Right now, I’m really looking forward to my grandmother seeing ye Zhuo’s true face! When that time comes, I’ll see if she still has the face to face people!” ”

“”Alright, Alright. Yuyan, don’t think so much.”Song Chenyu held Cen Yuyan and stood up from the ground. “It’s getting late. Let’s go back first.” ”

“En.”Cen Yuyan wiped her tears.

“The car that came to pick up the two of them had already arrived. Cen Yuyan didn’t go home. Instead, she followed song Chenyu to the hotel. ”

Cen Yuyan was very depressed after being rejected by Lu Xiu. She went to sleep after arriving at the hotel.

“At this moment, Song Chenyu received a message. ”

“When he saw the message, song Chenyu narrowed his eyes. There was a hint of coldness in his eyes. Then, he wore a mask and sunglasses and went to the basement of the hotel. ”

“”Superstar song, it’s really not easy to meet you.” ”

A young man with handsome features walked out from the back of a car. He looked no younger than song Chenyu. He had the standard appearance of a young hunk.

Song Chenyu’s eyes were filled with disgust. “What are you trying to do?”

The young man put his hands in his pockets. “Give me the money.”

“You want money again?”Song Chenyu frowned. “Didn’t I just give you two million a few days ago?”
