Translator: 549690339

“It was Zhou Zuolong who had raised Zheng Wanyin by himself, day and night. ”

“The kindness of raising her was greater than the heavens. Now that Xie Wanqiu had betrayed him, if Zheng Wanyin knew the truth, she would definitely help him get revenge. ”

She definitely would.

Zheng Wanyin was the child he had raised himself. He did not believe that Zheng Wanyin was an ingrate.

Zhou Zuolong clenched his fists tightly.

“Soon, ten minutes passed. ”

There was a knock on the door.

Xie wanqiu went to open the door.

It was Zheng Wanyin and Xie Rongle who had returned.

Xie rongle smiled and looked at Wu Youyu. “Uncle.”

Uncle?

Zhou Zuolong was stunned again.

Xie rongle actually called Wu Youyu uncle!

“It seemed that everyone in the Xie family knew of Wu Youyu’s existence, but he did not. ”

How laughable.

It was simply laughable.

He was that idiot who was as dumb as a pig!

“Wu youyu smiled and said, “Where did rongle come from?” ”

“Xie rongle said, “He just arrived a few days ago.” ”

Wu Youyu nodded and walked over to Zheng Wanyin. “Yinyin.”

Zheng Wanyin just looked at Wu Youyu and did not say anything.

“Xie wanqiu smiled and said, “This child, why are you standing there like a Fool? Call for help! This is your biological grandfather!” ”

“Through the screen, Zhou Zuolong’s gaze was fixed on Zheng Wanyin. ”

Don’t call.

Zheng Wanyin was his granddaughter that he had raised. She would definitely not call others grandfather.

“At this moment, Zheng Wanyin became Zhou Zuolong’s last hope. ”

As long as Zheng Wanyin did not betray him.

“In the future, he would treat Zheng Wanyin like his biological granddaughter. ”

“Grandfather.”

“At this moment, Zheng Wanyin suddenly spoke on the screen. ”

Grandpa.

Hur.

Zheng Wanyin actually called Wu Youyu Grandpa.

Ingrate!

All ingrates!

This whole family was all ingrates.

“Xie wanqiu, that damn B * Tch! ”

Zheng Wanyin was a little B * Tch!

Zhou Zuolong picked up his phone and slammed it hard on the ground. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

PA —

The phone shattered on the ground.

The loud sound attracted the attention of the coffee shop attendant.

“The attendant immediately trotted over. “Old Sir, may I help you?” ”

“No need...”Zhou Zuolong’s expression was unclear.

“The attendant continued, “If you need help, just let me know.” ”

“Okay.”Zhou Zuolong nodded.

What should he do?

What should he do now?

In just a moment.

“His wife, granddaughter, niece... ... all became someone else’s. ”

Zhou Zuolong touched the fruit knife at his waist.

How about...

Let’s perish together!

“After some thought, Zhou Zuolong put down the knife again. ”

“There were four of them, and he was alone. He was not their match at all. ”

What was Xie Wanqiu and the others’goal?

Money.

And family assets.

Then he would let Xie Wanqiu and the others get nothing.

Nothing at all!

“He would let the old B * Tch, the Little B * TCH, all get their comeuppance! ”

Zhou Zuolong picked up the phone on the ground and quickly walked out.

On the other side.

In the hospital ward.

Xie wanqiu received a call.

It was from Zhou Zuolong.

“”Hello, Old Man.” ”

“There was nothing unusual in Zhou Zuolong’s voice on the other end of the phone. “Wanqiu, I’m at the airport now. I may not be able to return to Beijing for another two days.” ”

“Where are you going?”Xie wanqiu frowned.

Why did Zhou Zuolong suddenly go back?

She had not heard him mention this matter before.

Could it be...

That there was something hidden?

“Zhou zuolong continued, “I have something to do when I go back. It’s about that unfilial daughter. Don’t worry. When I come back, I will definitely bring that unfilial daughter and unfilial son to Kowtow to you and apologize!” ”

“Hearing this, Xie wanqiu heaved a sigh of relief. It turned out that Zhou Zuolong went back because of the matter between Zhou Xiang and Zhou Jinbei. ”

“”Old Man, go back quickly. Yinyin and I will wait for you at the hospital.” ”

“Okay.”

“After hanging up the phone, Wu Youyu asked impatiently, “What happened?” ”

“Xie wanqiu smiled and said, “Zhou Zuolong went back.” ”

“Go Back? For what?”Wu Youyu asked.

“Xie wanqiu said, “He went back because of Zhou Xiang and Zhou Jinbei. He also said that when he comes back, he will bring Zhou Jinbei and Zhou Xiang to Kowtow to me and admit his mistakes.” ”

“Hearing that, Xie rongle hurriedly said, “Aunt, then is it possible for me to marry Zhou Jinbei?” ”

“Xie wanqiu nodded. “Don’t worry, Rongle. As long as I’m here, you’ll definitely take the position of the mistress of the Zhou family!” ”

“After all, Zhou Zuolong was the marionette in her hands! ”

“Xie rongle said excitedly, “Really, aunt?” ”

“Of course it’s true!”Xie wanqiu nodded.

“Zhou Zuolong, who was sitting in the airport terminal, saw the scene on the monitor and sneered. ”
