“Before Mi Jiadi could say anything, ye Zhuo continued, “Dr. Mi Jiadi, do you still remember what you said on the international website? If you don’t remember, I can help you recall it.” ”

“As soon as he finished speaking, the big screen behind ye Zhuo immediately displayed mi Jiadi’s words on the international website that day. ”

Mi Jiadi looked at the big screen and wished that she could find a hole to hide in.

Ruthless!

Ye Zao’s move was too ruthless!

“Mi Jiadi had never suffered any losses before, but this time, she had suffered such a loss. ”

“Moreover, it was a loss that she would never be able to get up from. How could mi Jiadi accept this! ”

She was extremely unwilling!

“But now, in the face of his words that day, his words of denial were no different from slapping her own face, especially in front of so many people. ”

“At this moment, Mi Jiadi could only bite the bullet and stand up, looking at Ye Zhuo. “Dr. YC, since we have signed a betting agreement with you, we will definitely abide by the spirit of the contract.” ”

“”I knew Dr. Mi Jiadi was not a person who would go back on his words.”Ye Zhuo continued, “Captain Yu, bring the contract over.” ”

“”Yes.”Yu Zifei immediately picked up the contract that he had prepared in advance, walked to Mi Jiadi, and said very politely, “Doctor, Please.” ”

“Mi Jiadi held the pen. At this moment, his hands were trembling. ”

“If he signed this contract, in the future, country C would be completely unable to raise its head in front of the rest of the world. However, if he did not sign it, he would not be able to step down. ”

Mi Jiadi was very regretful now.

“Yu Zifei continued at this time, “Professor, if you don’t like this pen, I can change it for you.” ”

“Then, Yu Zifei took out another pen from his suit pocket and handed it to Mi Jiadi. ”

“At this moment, MI Jiadi had no choice but to take the pen and sign the contract. ”

He had let down C Nation!

He was a sinner!

“At this moment, Mi Jiadi even wanted to die to apologize. ” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Kevin!

It was all Kevin’s fault!

“If it wasn’t for Kevin, he wouldn’t have done so much. ”

Mi Jiadi clenched her fists tightly.

“In a moment, he handed the signed contract to Yu Zifei. ”

“Yu Zifei took it with both hands. “Thank you for your cooperation, Doctor.” ”

“Mi Jiadi said what she should do with a pale face. Then, she stood up and turned around to leave. ”

“Kevin watched the entire live broadcast, including Mi Jiadi signing the contract. ”

“He knew that when Mi Jiadi returned, he definitely wouldn’t have a good ending. Therefore, at this moment, he had already boarded the plane to M continent. ”

“Fortunately, Kevin was alone in C Nation. He only needed to take care of himself and did not need to worry about others. ”

“When Mi Jiadi came back, Kevin was already hidden in some corner of m continent. ”

Mi Jiadi was furious. She could only vent her anger on Wen Zhi’s family and take away all the security for Wen Zhi’s family.

“Property, real estate, work, and the schooling of her children. ”

“In just one night, Old Mrs. Wen, who was still talking about how her son had finally made it, was dumbfounded. ”

“She never expected that one day, she would turn from the old Mrs. Wen, who was flattered by everyone, into a poor old woman with no home. ”

“Old Mrs. Wen wanted to return to her country, but she was now a citizen of country C. even if she returned to China, there would be no place for her in China. ”

...

“After the oasis project was completed, Ye Zhuo began to carry out the plan to move to Mars. ”

Although Mars was not big.

It was not a problem for only Chinese people to live on Mars.

Seeing that Chinese people could move to Mars made the citizens of the surrounding countries very envious.

“In addition to moving to Mars, Ye Zhuo also set up a lot of attractions on Mars for foreign tourists to play and strive to let every citizen become a boss in their own home. ”

“After all, citizens all over the world were very eager to visit Mars. ”

Setting up attractions on Mars was definitely a win-win situation.

“[ I knew that humans would one day be able to create a second earth, but I didn’t expect that day to come so quickly! ] ”

[ Dr. YC is really amazing! ]

“[ although I can move to Mars, I still can’t bear to part with Earth. After all, earth is the birthplace of humans. ] ”

“[ miss ye said that if you want to return to Earth, you can return to Earth at any time. There are many spacecraft that fly to Earth every day. On average, it takes half an hour, so you can come and go freely. ] ”

[ I Love Miss Ye! ]

[ it feels so good to be slapped in the face. Where are all those people who once thought that Miss Ye was at her wit’s End? Why Don’t you come out and find a sense of existence? ]
