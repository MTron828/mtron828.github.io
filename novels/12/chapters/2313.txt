“[ what the person above said is not an exaggeration at all. You have always thought that the aircraft carrier plan is nothing, and even think that YC has run out of ideas. But have you ever thought about why, other than YC, there is no other country that has built a second aircraft carrier? Because of this aircraft carrier, China has already surpassed country C for more than 50 years! Is it that hard to admit that others are outstanding? ] ”

“After the aircraft carrier came into being, China directly became the world’s largest country. ”

“YC also became the first person in technology, a big shot that could not be surpassed. Countless countries tried to rope YC in with superior conditions to change their nationality, but in the end, it was all for naught. ”

“If such an achievement was placed in ancient times, it was indeed necessary to set up a temple to ascend to godhood. ”

“Although the times were different now, her achievements would still be recorded in history for future generations to learn from. ”

“[ who said that YC’s achievements were only aircraft carriers? ]? As far as I knew, ZY Technology Co. , Ltd. was YC’s. Other than YC, who else could invent clothes that could adjust the temperature? Those people who secretly complained about YC behind the screen, did you look down at Yourselves? ] ”

“Also, according to the statistics of the netizens, YC already had a bunch of unknown aliases ”

Let’s get down to business. What we’re discussing now is whether or not the OASIS project can be successfully completed. What are you all talking about

“I suspect that they were all hired by YC to clean up YC’s name. Two years ago, the Mars Oasis project was very popular, and YC was the first person in technology. There was never the word ‘Lose’in her dictionary. If she lost this time, how would she face her parents in Jiangdong ”

“There’s still a week before the official announcement. I’d like to see how those dogs will deal with themselves if the oasis project fails.”

“For a time, the internet was abuzz with discussions. ”

Some foreign media outlets were also following up on the news of the OASIS project. They had even arranged for spies to enter the Cen family base.

“These people had yellow skin and black hair, and they had Asian faces. It was impossible to tell whether they were Chinese or Japanese. ”

“China had stood too high in the past. If the Mars project was successfully announced, then China’s status in the world would rise to another level. Therefore, the surrounding countries were all looking forward to the failure of the official announcement of the project. ”

“In addition, since the day of the implementation of the OASIS project, it was almost the official announcement date, but there was still no news at all. Everyone was even more certain that the oasis project was a failure. ”

“If the OASIS project went well, the CEN base would not have no news at all. ”

No news was the best news.

How would YC end up this time?

...

“At the same time, on Mars. ”

Ye Zhuo was wearing a thick and heavy isolation suit as she stood in the laboratory.

“She was slender and tall. Even though she was wearing a thick and heavy isolation suit, it could not hide her slender legs. She had an extraordinary temperament. ”

Yu Zifei stood behind her and reported the experimental data.

The others were working in an orderly manner.

“The official announcement date of the OASIS project was about to arrive. During this period of time, the laboratory was especially busy to prepare for the official announcement. After all, the official announcement faced the public all over the world, so there could not be the slightest mistake. ”

“After reporting all the data, Yu Zifei handed the document in her hand to Ye Zhuo. “Miss Ye, take a look. If there’s no problem, you can sign it directly.” ”

“There’s no problem.”Ye Zhuo took the document and opened his red lips slightly. “I’ll sign it later. Come to my office in ten minutes.”

“Okay.”Yu Zifei nodded.

Ye Zhuo turned around and walked towards his office.

“After ye Zhuo left, Yu Zifei looked at his assistant beside him. “Go and tell Dr. Zhang that I might have to go to the experimental plot later.” ”

“Okay.”The assistant nodded.

“Yu Zifei didn’t notice that after he turned around, his assistant’s eyes lit up. ”

“As long as ye Zao signed the document, the OASIS project wouldn’t be able to be officially announced. ”

“The outside world said that ye Zao had a graceful bearing and was better than the man. But now, it seemed that he was only so-so. No one in the huge laboratory noticed his abnormality. ”

He was simply a weakling.

“China, that was all there was to it. ” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Ye Zao’s aircraft carrier project was already at its peak. In the future, there would definitely be no more incidents that could surpass the aircraft carrier project. Sooner or later, someone else would catch up to him. ”

“Thinking of this, the assistant’s face was full of sarcasm. ”

“After a moment, he turned around and left the laboratory. ”

On the other side.

Yu Zifei came to the office.

Ye Zao handed the signed document to Yu Zifei. “This has already been signed.”

“Okay.”Yu Zifei reached out and took the document.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Are there any other problems at the experimental plot?” ”
