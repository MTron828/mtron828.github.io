There are definitely other extraterrestrials on earth.

“If that’s really the case, then there’s no need to investigate. ”

“Because even if they really found out who stole it, the other party would have long fled without leaving a trace. ”

“Lin Ze sat in front of his desk, frowning. ”

He loved the ancient culture of China very much.

“He also hoped that more people would know about the ancient culture. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have left the Yuan dynasty’s only copy in the library for people to read. ”

“But now, the only copy was lost. ”

“A moment later, Lin Ze took out his phone and dialed a number. “Check the surveillance footage around xiayue library on the 18th. Send it to my email after you’re done organizing it.” ”

“No matter what, Lin Ze was still unwilling to lose the only one he had. ”

...

On the other side.

“Shi Qingcheng found ye Zao and hugged his arm. “Zao, what do you think of Bai Jingshu?” ”

“She’s pretty good.”Ye Zao nodded.

Shi Qingcheng smiled. “I want to set her up with your brother. What do you think?”Shi Qingcheng herself fell into the sweetness of love and couldn’t wait to be a matchmaker. She wanted to make Bai Jingshu and Lin Ze fall in love too.

“Hearing this, Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Go and ask my brother. It’s not up to me.” ”

The most important thing in this kind of thing was that the two of them could look at each other.

“Otherwise, they would just be busying themselves. ”

“”I’ve asked him, and he actually said that he’s not in a hurry now!”Shi Qingcheng continued, “I think that your brother is quite Buddhist! Just tell him unilaterally whether Bai Jingshu and your brother are compatible or not.” ”

“Lin Ze was handsome, and there were many girls chasing after him, ”

“”She’s compatible with him. Bai Jingshu has a good personality, and she has the same hobbies as my brother.”Speaking up to this point, ye Zhuo paused and turned to look at Shi Qingcheng, “Qingcheng, don’t worry about it. What if she has a boyfriend?” ”

“”Absolutely not!”Shi Qingcheng said resolutely, “I’ve already asked, she’s still single.” ”

Ye Zao chuckled. “This matchmaker is really responsible.”

“”That’s a must!”Shi Qingcheng said proudly, “I must set up your brother and Bai Jingshu. You Don’t know that I like Bai Jingshu the moment I see her! If I were a man, I would have done it myself!” ”

Bai Jingshu had a special charm about her.

She had a scholarly scent. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly. “Why don’t I sponsor you to change your personality?”

“”What are you talking about, Yaozhuo!”Shi Qingcheng said somewhat embarrassedly, “If I were to change my personality, what would ye Xiaohan do?” ”

“”SIS, what are you guys talking about?”Coincidentally, Ye Han walked over from the side. ”

“When Ye Zhuo knew that the two of them were really like glue, he stood up and said, “Ask your girlfriend yourself. I still have something to do, so I’ll leave first.” ”

“After saying that, Ye Zhuo turned around and walked out, leaving the space for the two of them. ”

“”What did you guys talk about just now?”Ye Han asked curiously, “Why did my sister want to leave the moment she saw me coming over?” ”

“We were talking about the secrets between girls. Are you sure you still want to ask?”Shi Qingcheng said.

“”Oh, I won’t ask.”Ye Han immediately changed his words. ”

“That’s a good girl.”Shi Qingcheng patted ye Han’s head.

“Ye Han continued, “Godmother asked me to come over and ask you what you want to eat tonight.” ”

“Shi Qingcheng Thought for a moment. “En, I want to try seafood.” ”

“Recently, she had been poisoned from eating sown seeds, so she suddenly wanted to try king crab and coconut shell. ”

“”Okay, I’ll talk to godmother.”Ye Han nodded. ”

“I’ll go with you.”Shi Qingcheng followed ye Han’s footsteps.

“Ye Han continued, “We’ve been on Earth for quite some time already. When are you planning to go back?” ”

“Hearing the word ‘go back’, Shi Qingcheng’s face immediately became sullen. ”

“”I’ll play for a while more. Anyway, I have nothing to do when I go back now.”Shi Qingcheng said. ”

“”You don’t have anything to do, but I have a lot of things to do.”Ye Han continued, “The great clan leader and the others have already urged me several times.” ”

“Shi Qingcheng frowned slightly, “Then why don’t you go back first, and wait for me to play for a few more days before going back.” ”

“”Alright.”Ye Han nodded, “I’m preparing to leave Tomorrow Night.” ”

“Hearing that Ye Han was going back tomorrow night, Shi Qingcheng was very reluctant to part with him. ”

“After all, she and Ye Han had just started. ”

“Between the choices, she continued, “Forget it, forget it, I’ll go back with you!” ”

“Really?”Ye Han looked back and said with some surprise.

“”En.”Shi Qingcheng nodded and said, “Ye Xiaohan, look at how much I’ve sacrificed for you. If you dare to disappoint me in the future, I’ll definitely smash your head and kick your legs off!” ”
