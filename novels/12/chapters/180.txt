The maid who opened the door led ye Zhuo inside, as they walked, she said, “Hello, Divine Doctor Ye. I’m the Cen family’s housekeeper. You can call me aunt Shang. Old Lady has been thinking about you since early in the morning. I’m sure she’ll be very happy to see you later!”

Aunt Shang had followed her from the capital.

Her husband was a housekeeper in the Cen family’s old residence in the capital.

Old Lady Cen had long treated her as a family member, so she told her everything.

Aunt Shang knew that old lady cen treated ye Zhuo as her future daughter-in-law.

Therefore, Aunt Shang was especially respectful to ye Zhuo.

She did not give him any perfunctory treatment.

It was the kind of respect that came from the bottom of her heart.

At first, when she did not see ye Zao, Aunt Shang was still worried that old lady cen might have been deceived.

Now, when she saw ye Zao, all that was left in Aunt Shang’s heart was amazement.

It turned out that there really was such a person in the world.

She was beautiful

......

And she also had such a temperament.

At a glance, one would know that she was not some ordinary person.

Not to mention the small Yunjing, even the orthodox aristocratic young ladies in the four or nine cities were not even one-tenth of her.

In the past, Aunt Shang did not understand why old lady cen liked ye Zhuo so much.

Now that she had met him, not to mention Old Lady Cen, even she had also fallen in love with him.

In the main hall.

When she saw the maid run over and say that Miracle Doctor Ye had arrived, Old Lady Cen stood up from the sofa in surprise. “Where is he? where is he?”

The Ragdoll cat in her arms jumped to the ground in fright because of Old Lady Cen’s action. It meowed and meowed incessantly in grievance.

Old Lady Cen did not care about Zhou Xiang’s beloved cat and hurriedly walked out.

Zhou Xiang came down from upstairs. When he saw his beloved cat meowing like this, his heart ached as he picked the cat up from the ground. “Baby, What’s wrong? Who bullied you?”

After saying that, Zhou Xiang turned to look at the servant beside him. “Where’s the old lady? Where did she go in such a hurry?”

The servant said, “Miracle Doctor Ye has arrived. The old lady has gone to the door to fetch someone.”

Hearing that.

Zhou Xiang was stunned!

He could not care less about his beloved cat in his arms. He threw the cat aside and ran out in a hurry.

The ragdoll cat that was thrown on the ground said, “I’m too difficult!”!

On the cherry blossom path in the manor, a tree was blooming with pink cherry blossoms.

The spring breeze blew, and a shower of flowers arrived. Such a beautiful scene made people think of Heaven on Earth.

Old Lady Cen had just walked into the garden when she saw ye Zao walking over.

His figure was slender.

He was wearing a long wine-red coat, and every step he took was graceful. It was hard not to notice him.

Ordinary people standing in front of the gorgeous cherry blossoms would be overshadowed.

But she was different. Not only was she not overshadowed, but her jade-like delicate face had actually snatched away some of the beauty of the cherry blossoms.

This was the real thing: a person was more colorless than a flower, and a flower would also lose its color in front of a person!

Separated by layers of cherry blossoms, old Mrs. Cen was stunned for a moment before she ran in front of ye Zao.

“Yezi!”

“Grandma Cen.”

“Yezi!”Old Mrs. Cen jogged over and held ye Zao’s hand. “Why didn’t you call me when you arrived? So that I could pick you up at the door!”

Ye Zhuo smiled. “I know the way. There’s no need to go through so much trouble.”

Old Mrs. Cen asked curiously, “By the way, how did you get in?”Jinxiu manor was different from other residential areas. The security here was very strict.

Under normal circumstances, people outside could not enter at all.

Usually, even when a delivery person came in, the security department had to make a phone call to check with the residents inside.

Not only was old Mrs. Cen curious, even Aunt Shang, who was following behind them, felt a little strange.

Ye Zhuo asked curiously, “Is it really difficult to come in?”

Aunt Shang smiled and answered, “Old Mrs. Cen, I reckon that those people saw Miss Ye’s aloof temperament and knew at a glance that she was not an ordinary person, so they let her in.”

“Right, right, right! That’s the reason! Shu Zhen, you’re Right!”Old Mrs. Cen had a proud look on her face.

Her granddaughter-in-law was indeed amazing!

She came in just by brushing her face!

No one else could do it.

The three of them had just walked out of the cherry blossom path.

Zhou Xiang walked over quickly.

When she saw ye Zhuo beside Old Madam Cen, Zhou Xiang was stunned.

This, this was ye Zhuo?

She didn’t hallucinate, right?

Ye Zhuo was also a little surprised. “Sister Zhou Xiang?”

Only when she heard ye Zhuo’s voice did Zhou Xiang react. She didn’t hallucinate!

This was real!

“Zao Zao!”

Old Mrs. Cen looked at the two of them in confusion. “Xiangxiang, do you know Ye Zi?”

“Mom, who did you say she was?”
