“Chen Hao nodded and looked at ye Zao, then said, “Father Ye, you’re not really from the future world, are you?””

“He remembered that ye Zao once joked that she was from the future world, and even said that in her world, although the human civilization had reached level four, the ecological environment had been severely damaged, she also called on everyone to protect the environment.”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Of course. When have I ever joked?””

“No one took ye Zao’s words seriously. Dr. Millet smiled and said, “Actually, I came from 300 years ago!””

“Then I came from 100 years ago!”

“But in a flash, the conference room returned to a relaxed atmosphere.”

The next day.

Yu Zifei waited for Zhang Pandi to go downstairs for lunch as usual.

“Ten minutes later, Zhang Pandi went downstairs as expected.”

“But the next second, the smile on Yu Zifei’s face froze at the corner of his mouth.”

Who was the man next to Zhang Pandi?

“If he was not mistaken, the two of them were holding hands.”

“”Pandi!”Yu Zifei immediately walked over, his face filled with anger, “Zhang Pandi, what are you doing?””

“Zhang Pandi raised her head to look at Yu Zifei. “I’ve already made it very clear to you yesterday. Since you can’t give me what I want, someone will give it to me! Yu Zifei, I’ve given you a chance, but you don’t know how to cherish it!””

“At this moment, the man beside Zhang Pandi blocked in front of her, with a smug look on his face, he said, “Yu Zifei, now that Zhang Pandi is my girlfriend, don’t provoke my girlfriend in the future! Otherwise, don’t blame me for being rude to you!””

“Yu Zifei also knew this man. He was Tang Xue’s right-hand man, Zhou Rui! Zhou Rui was 1.7 meters tall and weighed 180 kilograms. Because of his weight, he could not find a girlfriend. It was not until the news that Tang Xue would become the base’s agent spread out in the next few days that Zhou Rui became popular.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Pandi! Tell me. This is not true!”Yu Zifei had given his true feelings to Zhang Pandi. He did not believe that Zhang Pandi would lie to her.

“Zhang Pandi held Zhou Rui’s hand tightly. “Yu Zifei, wake up. This is true! Don’t blame me. If you want to blame someone, you can only blame yourself for not knowing what’s good for you.””

“Compared to the handsome Yu Zifei, she would definitely not choose the Fat Zhou Rui.”

But Zhou Rui had the ability.

Zhou Rui could get her to join the Tang family’s laboratory with just a sentence.

Could Yu Zi Not?

“Zhang Panti had no other choice. Today was the last day. After Tomorrow, even if she found Zhou Rui, she would not be able to join the Tang family’s laboratory.”

“After saying that, Zhang Panti looked at Zhou Rui again and said sweetly, “Zhou Rui, let’s Go!””

“”Okay.”Zhou Rui nodded and looked at Yu Zifei proudly. When he passed by Yu Zifei, he even noticed Yu Zifei bump into him.”

“Yu Zifei stood rooted to the ground, his face pale.”

“”Brother, you must be disheartened! What did I say yesterday? Didn’t you not believe me? Do You Believe Me Now?”Cen Hai walked over from the side and crossed his arms as he looked at Yu Zifei.”

Yu Zifei hugged Cen Hai and cried bitterly.

“Cen Hai stood rooted to the ground and was stunned. He stretched out a finger and poked Yu Zifei on the shoulder, “Hey, why are you still crying? A man is a man. Isn’t it embarrassing? You are so handsome. Are you afraid that you won’t be able to find a girlfriend? “Tomorrow is the launch ceremony. When our aircraft carrier successfully lifts off, there will be a day that Zhang Pandi regrets!””

“Yu Zifei was really a little upset. After being with Zhang Pandi for so many years, he had never thought that they would end things this way.”

This kind of betrayal was heart-wrenching. It was so painful that he could not breathe. Perhaps only those who had experienced it would understand!

Cen Hai comforted him for a long time before he comforted Yu Zifei’s emotions.

“”Alright, Don’t cry anymore. Tomorrow is the aircraft carrier launch ceremony. The team is busy! Come back with me and help!””

“Yu Zifei nodded. Thinking of the launch ceremony tomorrow, his heart felt a little better.”

“Although Love was gone, his career was still there.”

May 18th.

Saturday.

“At the same time, today was also the day of the launch ceremony of the aircraft carrier.”

The launch ceremony was held at 10:18 am.

“Before 8 am, the audience in the live broadcast room had reached 30 million. This was not even counting the foreign live broadcast rooms.”

“Although there was a time difference with China, the foreign audience still stayed in front of the live broadcast room, afraid of missing out on something.”

[ I’m so excited! I wonder what YC will do for the first match! Will she sell her misery? ]

“[ she will definitely sell her misery, but it’s not certain if China will buy it! ]”

“[ ah! It’s so embarrassing! I heard that the people all over the world will be able to watch today’s live broadcast. Damn it, I won’t have the face to travel abroad in the future! ]”

“Seeing the comments on the bullet screen, Tang Xue entered a line of text and clicked to send it. [ I hope to expel YC’s nationality! China doesn’t have such scum! ]”

“She originally wanted to send it out to see what kind of attitude everyone had, but she didn’t expect that once this sentence was sent, it immediately received many likes.”

[ I support the leader’s idea to drive YC out of China ]

[ I support + 1! ]

Tang Xue looked at the bullet screen and slightly curved her lips.

“Seeing Tang Xue like this, Bai Yun, who was at the side, asked curiously, “Sister, what are you laughing at?””

“Tang Xue immediately reacted and said, “Nothing. Bai Yun, you can sit here with my mother later.””

“”Okay.”Bai Yun nodded and continued, “Oh right, why didn’t I see ye Zao? Did she run away at the last minute?””

“Today was not a flight ceremony for ye Zao, but a large-scale humiliation scene.”

Tang Xue frowned slightly. Only then did she remember that she had not seen ye Zao for a period of time.

“This leaf burning, is not really run?”
