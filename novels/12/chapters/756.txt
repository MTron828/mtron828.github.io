“”I didn’t take it off.”Ye Zhuo raised his hand to touch the side of his ear, but he didn’t find the crystal hair clip. “Why is it missing?””

“Zhao pingting said, “Could it be missing?””

Ye Zhuo hurriedly lowered his head to look for it on the carpet.

“Although he had only worn it once, she still quite liked the hair clip.”

An Lizi and Zhao Pingting also helped to look for it.

“But after searching for a long time, they still couldn’t find that hair clip.”

The three of them had no choice but to give up on searching.

They planned to buy another one after the assessment competition tomorrow.

...

At the same hotel.

“The man returned to his room and took off the hat on his head, revealing an extremely clear and handsome face.”

This was song Shiyu.

“Song Shiyu casually threw the hat on the sofa, took his cell phone, and made a call. “Send a bottle of glue over.””

“After saying that, he hung up the phone.”

“A few minutes later, there was a knock on the door.”

Song Shiyu walked over to open the door.

It was his assistant who had sent the glue over.

“”Boss, this is glue that can stick to metal. This is for shoes and this is for paper.”As he did not know what song Shiyu wanted to stick to, his assistant brought three bottles of glue over.”

Song Shiyu reached out to take the glue. “Got it.”

“The assistant continued, “Boss, do you need help?””

“”No need.”Song Shiyu’s face was expressionless. “If there’s anything, I’ll call you.””

The assistant nodded.

“Song Shiyu continued, “Oh right, get the kitchen to make a bowl of brown sugar ginger water and send it over.”This hotel was under the Song Empire Group. In order to get the literary world to arrange a hotel for the examinees of the literary world, song Shiyu had also put in a lot of effort.”

“Okay.”

The assistant was already used to song Shiyu’s habit of drinking brown sugar ginger water every day.

“After the assistant left, song Shiyu closed the door and sat in front of the desk. He turned on the table lamp and took out the hair clip that had been stepped into two halves from his pocket.”

“Not only was the hair clip stepped into two halves, but a lot of the crystals embedded on it had also fallen off.”

“Song Shiyu placed the hair clip on the white paper, picked up the broken crystals with tweezers, and decorated their original positions one by one. Then, he put glue on them.”

“This kind of glue was very strong. Soon, song Shiyu’s fingers were covered with shiny glue.”

“However, he did not seem to care about this.”

His attention was all on the hair clip.

“An hour later, song Shiyu finally glued the hair clip back together.”

“Looking at the glued hair clip, a faint smile finally appeared on song Shiyu’s face.”

“Half an hour later, the assistant came over with the brown sugar ginger water.”

“Song Shiyu took the brown sugar ginger water and said, “Go get me a jewelry box.””

Jewelry Box?

The assistant was stunned.

Could it be that the Boss had a girlfriend?

“Just as the assistant was wondering, song Shiyu continued, “It’s best if it’s made of Crystal.””

“Only then did the assistant react. “Yes, Boss.””

“After leaving song Shiyu’s room, the assistant went to prepare the crystal jewelry box that song Shiyu wanted.”

...

“In the blink of an eye, it was the next day.”

9:30 in the morning for the exam.

“Ye Zhuo got up at 6 am on time. Although she stayed in the hotel, she did not forget the habit of getting up and running.”

“When she got up, an Lizi and Zhao pingting were still sound asleep.”

The three of them played games until midnight last night.

It was normal that an Lizi and Zhao Pingting could not get up at this time.

“Although the three of them stayed in a suite and had their own rooms, the three of them still slept in the same room last night.”

“After ye Zhuo washed up, she went to the hotel garden for a run.”

7:30 pm.

“The garden was very quiet. There was almost no one in it. A gentle breeze blew past, bringing with it a faint fragrance of flowers.”

“The morning sun rose slowly from the east, coating everything on the Earth with a layer of faint golden light.”

“Ye Zhuo liked this kind of morning very much. She narrowed her eyes and took a deep breath. At this moment, the golden morning sun seemed to have become one with her. It was extremely eye-catching.”

“From the balcony on the third floor, she could see this scene.”

Song Shiyu knew that she had the habit of jogging in the morning.

He did not expect to see this scene as soon as he walked to the balcony. The corners of his mouth curled up slightly.

Song Shiyu stood on the balcony for as long as ye Zao ran in the garden. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“After ye Zao ran back to the room, an Lizi and Zhao Pingting had just woken up.”

“An Lizi rubbed her eyes and yawned as she asked, “Where did you go so early in the morning, Zhuo Zhuo?””

“”I went for a run,”ye Zhuo continued, “The two of you should get up quickly. After washing up, we’ll go to the first floor to have breakfast.””

“Zhao Pingting said with her sleepy eyes, “Let’s sleep a little longer. It’s only 7:30 now. We’ll get up at 8:00 and set off for the Examination Hall at 8:30. We’ll be there at 9:00.””
