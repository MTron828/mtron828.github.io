“After the interview ended, ye Shu asked, “Comrade, when can I see it on TV?” ”

“It was her first time on TV in her life, so ye Shu couldn’t help but feel a little excited. ” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“The reporter said, “About a week from now, we will be able to see the news every day at 6 pm on our Yunjing television station. Then, there will be a rebroadcast at 12 pm and 3 pm during the day.” ”

“”Alright, thank you.” ”

“The Ye family’s private restaurant business had always been very popular. Ever since they found out that the top scorer of the science department in Yunjing City was the daughter of the Ye family’s private restaurant owner, many people had come because of the fame and wanted to bask in the joy of the top scorer’s restaurant. ”

“The power of the internet was too great. In less than a day, the Ye family’s private restaurant had become popular in Yunjing. ”

“After ye Zhuo was done with the interview, he gave Old Mrs. Cen a call. ”

“After Old Mrs. Cen received the call from ye Zhuo, she was extremely excited. ”

She quickly went upstairs to look for Zhou Xiang. “Xiang Xiang! It’s a joyous occasion!”

“”What’s the matter, Mom?”Zhou Xiang was applying a facial mask. When she heard that, she turned around to look at Old Mrs. Cen. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “She won! Xiang Xiang! My Granddaughter-in-law won!” ”

“Won what?”Zhou Xiang was confused.

Old Mrs. Cen grabbed Zhou Xiang’s hand. “My granddaughter-in-law is the top scorer in high school! 749 points! The top scorer in Yunjing City!”

“Really?”

“Old Mrs. Cen said with a proud face, “My granddaughter-in-law is so powerful, of course it’s true!” ”

“Zhou Xiang couldn’t even put on a face mask anymore and directly pulled it off. “Zhuozhuo said that she wants to enter Beijing University. If that’s the case, then we can go back to Beijing together with Zhuozhuo!” ”

Yun Jing and Zhou Xiang had had enough of staying!

“”Of course!”Old Mrs. Cen nodded, “It’s just that Shaoqing still has to work harder. There are so many young men in Beijing University. They’re younger than Shaoqing, more romantic than Shaoqing, and more flirtatious than Shaoqing. What if they abduct my granddaughter-in-law?” ”

“Compared to them, besides being a little handsome and rich, Cen Shaoqing had no other advantages. ”

But what was the use of being handsome?

Could being handsome be used as food?

What was the use of having money?

Who would be willing to look at an ice cube face every day?

Old Age!

Not knowing how to laugh!

Not knowing how to make a girl happy.

Not knowing how to sweet-talk.

Not even touching a girl’s hand.

“In old Mrs. Cen’s opinion, Cen Shaoqing was simply full of flaws. ”

“”Yes,”Zhou Xiang echoed, “Mom! What you said makes sense! I have to talk to Shaoqing about it properly later.” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen said, “Don’t get involved in this matter. I have a way to deal with that Brat.” ”

“When she came out of Zhou Xiang’s room, Old Mrs. Cen happened to meet Cen Shaoqing who had just returned from the company. ”

He was holding a string of Buddhist beads in his hand and mumbling something.

Old Mrs. Cen guessed that he was probably chanting Buddhist scriptures.

“She, an old lady, did not believe in Buddhism as much as he did. She did not know how a young man like him could have such a hobby. Old Mrs. Cen really could not understand. ”

Old Lady Cen’s expression changed and she walked downstairs happily.

She was still humming a tune. “We common people are really happy today...”

“”Grandma, what are you so happy about?”Cen Shaoqing raised his eyebrows slightly. ”

“”Didn’t Yezi tell you?”Old Lady Cen looked at Cen Shaoqing in surprise, “Yezi got into the top scorer in the market!”! Do you think I wouldn’t be happy? “I need to call Zeyan right now and ask him to seize the opportunity to catch Yezi before school starts! “Once Yezi goes to Beijing University and faces so many outstanding young hunks, she will definitely choose the wrong ones! “Then Zeyan won’t have a chance!” ”

Old Mrs. Cen said as she walked downstairs.

“”Grandma,”Cen Shaoqing called out to her. ”

“What’s the matter?”She raised her head to look at him.

Cen Shaoqing’s tone was indifferent. “Ye Zhuo and Ze Yan aren’t suitable. You’d better not randomly pick a couple.”

“Whether they’re suitable or not isn’t up to you! A dog with a mouse is meddling in other people’s business!”She rolled her eyes at him.

“After saying that, she turned around and walked downstairs. ”

Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly.

He returned to his room.

“Cen Shaoqing sent a message to his secretary, [ take care of Zhou Zeyan during this period of time. ] ”

Zhou Zeyan was already in his third year of university.

“Not long ago, he officially entered the CEN Group’s branch company for an internship. ”

The secretary in front of the screen frowned slightly.

“If he remembered correctly, master five and Zhou Zeyan should be related. Why was master five always finding fault with Zhou Zeyan when he had nothing to do recently? ”

“After sending this message, CEN Shaoqing immediately turned on the wonderful sound. ”

“Seeing that ye Zhuo did not turn on the live broadcast, Cen Shaoqing backed out again. He set up a live broadcast reminder and began to process the documents. ”
