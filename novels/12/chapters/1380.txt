“”Of course it’s true,”old Zhang continued, “But professor William has a condition.” ”

“Zhou Jinbei said directly, “As long as professor William can repair the will, I’ll agree to any condition.” ”

“”That’s easy.”Old Zhang smiled and said, “Professor William wants all the assets in your name. If you agree, you can come and sign a contract with him tomorrow morning.” ”

All the assets?

“”What?”Zhou Jinbei was stunned. “Old Zhang, are you kidding me?” ”

“Old Zhang said, “Why are you reluctant to part with them?” ”

“”This has nothing to do with whether I’m willing to part with them or not.”Zhou jinbei continued, “Are you sure that Professor William wants all the assets under my name?” ”

“”Anyway, I’ve already brought the message to you. The choice is yours. At 11 o’clock tomorrow morning, professor William will be waiting for you at the studio. He won’t be there if you’re late.” ”

“After saying that, he hung up the phone. ”

Zhou Jinbei frowned.

Zhou Xiang turned to look at him. “Are You Alright?”

Zhou Jinbei smiled. “I’m fine.”

“On the other side, old Zhang hung up the phone and looked at Dr. William nervously. “Doctor, can we really do this? Isn’t it a little too much to ask for all of Zhou Jinbei’s assets?” ”

“Actually, asking for half was more or less enough. ”

“Speaking up to this point, old Zhang continued, “What if he goes to look for other people?” ”

“Since doctor William could repair the will, then other people would definitely be able to do the same. ”

Wouldn’t it be like a chicken flying to the egg?

“In order to gain Zhou Jinbei’s trust, Old Zhang had been hiding by Zhou Jinbei’s side for a long time. Old Zhang did not want to fail at the last moment. ”

“Doctor William leaned back in his chair and tapped the table with his index finger, he said confidently, “Don’t worry. In this world, no one can repair that suicide note except for me. No matter how many people he finds, in the end, they can only come to me for help unless he gives up on repairing the suicide note.” ”

Zhou Jinbei had investigated Wu Lan’s matter for so many years. How could he give up so easily?

“Moreover, professor William was not blindly confident. It was because he had the latest technology in the world. ”

“In a small country like China, there was no one who could match up to him! ”

“In this world, other than him, no one could repair the will. ”

“Therefore, Zhou Jinbei was in his hands this time. Zhou Jinbei had no other choice. ”

“Old Zhang smiled and said, “Then I’ll congratulate the professor in advance. As long as the Professor doesn’t forget about me.” ”

“Professor William raised his hand, and his blue eyes shined. “Don’t worry. I Won’t forget about you.” ”

“On the other side, in the car. ”

“After hanging up the phone, although Zhou Jinbei couldn’t accept it, he didn’t show it either. ”

“When the boat reached the bridge, it would be fine. If it really didn’t work out, so what if he really gave all his assets to Professor William? ”

“The car was very fast, and after thirty minutes, they arrived at the Cen family manor. ”

“When they arrived at the Cen family manor, Cen Shaoqing and Ye Zhuo hadn’t returned yet. Old Mrs. Cen warmly welcomed them from the hall. “Brother-in-law is here! What a rare guest!” ”

“Old Madam.”

“Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “Please come in quickly!” ”

“After she finished speaking, she raised her voice and instructed the servants, “Sister-in-law Wang, serve the best tea! His uncle hasn’t come to the house once in several years.” ”

“”Old Madam, you’re too polite.” ” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Old Mrs. Cen rebuked, “We’re all family. It’s too polite to say that. Brother-in-law, please take a seat. Shaoqing just called back. They’ll be home soon!” ”

“Okay.”Zhou Jinbei and old Mrs. Cen sat on the sofa together.

“After a while, Auntie Wang brought over the brewed tea. ”

“At this moment, footsteps sounded in the air. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen stood up from the sofa and said with a smile, “They’re here! Shaoqing and searing are back!” ”

Zhou Jinbei also put down his teacup.

“A moment later, two figures walked in from outside the door. ”

One of them was wearing a long gown with a bright red Buddhist pearl in his hand.

“The other was wearing a coat of the same color and a pair of black Martin boots. He had a graceful figure, bright eyes and white teeth, and was looking around with a brilliant expression. ”

“When these two people walked together, even if they did nothing, it was a beautiful scene. ”

“”Uncle,”Cen Shaoqing was the first to speak. ”

Zhou Jinbei nodded. “Shaoqing is back.”

“Cen Shaoqing continued to introduce, “Uncle, this is my girlfriend, Ye Zhuo. Leader, this is uncle.” ”

The CEN family members were already used to Cen Shaoqing addressing ye Zhuo as leader.

“However, this was the first time Zhou Jinbei heard it. ”

He felt that it was rather unbelievable.

“Cen Shaoqing was such a cold and aloof person, but he actually had such a tender moment. It was simply unbelievable. ”

“Ye Zao greeted him politely, “Hello, uncle. I’m Ye Zao.” ”

“”Hello, Hello.”Zhou Jinbei was so nervous that he did not know where to place his hands. At this moment, he seemed to have suddenly thought of something and took out a black bag from his pocket, “Eldest nephew’s wife. Uncle came in a hurry and did not have the time to prepare any decent gifts. Take this.” ”

Taking gifts on their first meeting?

That didn’t seem too good.

“Besides, she was a junior, so she should be the one preparing the gifts for Zhou Jinbei. ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “I appreciate uncle’s kindness.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing reached out to take the bag from Zhou Jinbei and opened his thin lips, “I’ll thank you on behalf of Cen Shaoqing.” ”

“”This silly child, what’s there to thank! No need to thank me!” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “Brother-in-law, you’re too polite. You came so easily, why did you bring a gift!” ”

“”It’s my duty, it’s my duty.” ”

“Soon, it was time for dinner. ”

“After dinner, everyone sat together and chatted. ”

“At this moment, ye Zao suddenly received a text message. He frowned slightly and replied: [ right away. ] ”

“After replying to the message, ye Zao took off his watch and fiddled with it a few times. The watch turned into a small computer. At the same time, a transparent screen appeared in the air. ”

“The laser keyboard was placed on the coffee table, and ye Zao’s ten fingers were constantly moving on the keyboard. ”

The screen was filled with code that could not be understood.

“String after string, it was dazzling to the eyes. ”

“This scene stunned Zhou Jinbei, and he said in disbelief, “What kind of high-tech is this?” ”

“Old Madam Cen had an expression that said, “My granddaughter-in-law is awesome. Ye Zi does this. It’s good that you’re used to it, brother-in-law.” ”

“Zhou jinbei continued, “Is my niece-in-law very proficient in computers?” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “She’s more than proficient. Yezi is an expert in this field. As long as she’s number one, no one will dare to call her number two!” ”

Zhou Jinbei’s face was filled with shock.

He did not expect ye Zao to be so proficient in computers.

“Five minutes later, ye Zao finished typing all the code. A design diagram appeared on the screen. As he operated the keyboard, he made a call. “The design diagram has been sent over. If there are any problems, contact me again.” ”

“After saying that, Ye Zao Hung Up. ”

“Zhou Jinbei watched helplessly as ye Zao turned a computer into an exquisite watch. However, he could not tell what was going on at all. ”

“He had always thought that the sci-fi plots on television were very exaggerated. Now, it seemed that the movies were all realistic! ”

“Zhou Jinbei walked to ye Zao’s side. “Eldest nephew’s wife, are you very proficient in computers?” ”

“”Yes, I’m Alright.”Ye Zao nodded slightly. ”

“Zhou jinbei continued, “Then do you know how to repair damaged documents?” ”

“I do.”

“Hearing this answer, Zhou Jinbei’s eyes lit up. “Great nephew’s wife, then can I trouble you to help me take a look? Can this be repaired successfully?” ”

“Ye Zao took the photo that Zhou Jinbei handed over and opened it to take a look. He then said, “This envelope is more than 30 years old, right?” ”

“Zhou Jinbei did not expect ye Zhuo to be able to tell the year of the suicide note just by looking at the photo. He nodded excitedly. “Yes, can it be repaired?” ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “It can be repaired.” ”
