“When he saw this, he was also stunned. ”

Suicide note.

Transfer Records.

Audio.

Every piece of evidence smashed Zhou Zuolong to the point where he could not stand up.

No Wonder Zhou Jinbei had not come to apologize to Zhou Zuolong. It turned out that he still had such a backup plan.

“Previously, the netizens had scolded Zhou Jinbei so badly that Zhou Zuolong was more than ten times worse than the previous Zhou Jinbei. ”

“”Old Man, what should we do now?”Xie Wanqiu’s voice was trembling. ”

“At that moment, Xie Rongle suddenly let out a scream. ” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Ah!”

“What’s Wrong?”Xie wanqiu turned to look at Xie Rongle.

“Xie rongle gulped. “Aunt, look at this.” ”

“Xie wanqiu took Xie Rongle’s phone. On the screen of the phone, it really showed Zheng Wanyin’s photos and news. ”

“The number of comments had already exceeded 100,000. ”

“Xie wanqiu said angrily, “This is a matter between the older generation. What has it got to do with yinyin? Yinyin is innocent! What’s wrong with her pursuing her own happiness? ! Old Man, Old Man, quickly think of something! What should I do?”No matter how good Xie Wanqiu was usually, she did not have the strength to turn the tide, but at this time, she did not have the strength to turn the tide. ”

“Zhou Zuolong tried his best to calm himself down. “Call Zhou Xiang. Call Zhou Xiang immediately and ask her to take yinyin away.”Zhou Zuolong knew Zhou Xiang very well. Zhou Xiang’s personality was weak, and Zhou Jinbei had always ignored them, but Zhou Xiang had called repeatedly to ask which hospital they were in. ”

“So, Zhou Xiang would definitely not ignore them. ”

“At this moment, he could not be bothered to ask the Cen family’s old lady to come personally to pick up Zheng Wanyin. ”

“Xie wanqiu said, “What if she doesn’t come?” ”

“”She won’t! Zhou Xiang will definitely come!”Zhou zuolong continued, “Unless she doesn’t want to acknowledge me as her father anymore!” ”

But would Zhou Xiang not acknowledge him as her father?

He wouldn’t!

“Zhou Xiang valued blood and kinship the most. Wu Lan was dead, and he was Zhou Xiang’s only father in this world. ”

“Moreover, Zhou Jinbei listened to Zhou Xiang the most. ”

“As long as he could get Zhou Xiang to come over, he would have a way to convince Zhou Xiang to get Zhou Jinbei to delete the nonsense on Weibo. ”

“Xie wanqiu nodded. “Okay, Wanyin, quickly call your second aunt and tell her the address of the hospital. Tell her to come over quickly.” ”

Zheng Wanyin picked up her phone and dialed Zhou Xiang’s number.

Di —

“Soon, the call connected. ”

“However, Zhou Xiang did not pick up. ”

“If it were any other day, Zhou Xiang would have picked up instantly. ”

But today.

“It had been almost a minute, yet Zhou Xiang still did not pick up. ”

Zheng Wanyin was extremely nervous.

Could it be that Zhou Xiang would not even acknowledge her as his niece because of this matter?

No.

It would not.

She didn’t do anything.

All of this was the fault of Xie Wanqiu and Zhou Zuolong.

She was also a victim.

Zhou Xiang couldn’t treat her like this.

“At this moment, the other end of the phone was finally picked up. “Hello, Wanyin.” ”

Zhou Xiang’s voice was still gentle and there was nothing abnormal about it.

“When she heard Zhou Xiang’s voice, Zheng Wanyin was so excited that she was about to cry. “Second aunt!” ”

“Zhou xiang continued, “What’s wrong, Wanyin? Did you suffer some grievances?” ”

“Zheng wanyin said, “Second aunt, please come to the second hospital quickly. Grandpa and Grandma are here. They have something to tell you.” ”

“”Okay.”Zhou Xiang’s tone was gentle. “Wanyin, don’t worry. I’ll come over right away.” ”

“”Yes, second aunt. We’ll wait for you here.” ”

“After hanging up the phone, Xie wanqiu asked impatiently, “How was it, yinyin? What did Zhou Xiang Say?” ”

“Zheng wanyin said, “Second aunt said that she’ll come over right away.” ”

“Really?”Xie wanqiu said excitedly.

“Really!”Zheng Wanyin nodded.

“Xie wanqiu continued, “Then, did Zhou Xiang’s voice have any abnormalities?” ”

“”No,”zheng wanyin said, “And he was concerned about whether something happened to me. He also told me not to worry.” ”

“Hearing these words, Xie wanqiu felt as if she had eaten a piece of reassurance. ”

It seemed that she had overestimated Zhou Xiang.

“She had originally thought that after this incident, Zhou Xiang would turn against them. ”

But that Idiot Zhou Xiang...

Was still as easy as waving his hand at them.

Just like a lapdog.

Zhou zuolong also heaved a sigh of relief.

“As long as Zhou Xiang did not alienate them, he was not afraid of Zhou Jinbei becoming a demon. ”

Unless...

Zhou Jinbei wanted to lose two of his family members at the same time.

“Zhou zuolong continued, “Yinyin, when Zhou Xiang comes later, you have to put on airs, understand? “Oh right, in the late autumn, you still have to record a video and post it online to prove that yinyin did not come knocking on the door, but that the Cen family head’s mother personally invited her!” ”
