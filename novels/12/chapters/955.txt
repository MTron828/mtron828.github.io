Translator: 549690339

Zhou Xiang looked at the marriage certificate on her phone and shook her head angrily.

“Cen Yueying’s heart was broken by Cen Yuyan. She looked at Zhou Xiang and said, “Mom, she chose this path herself. We’ve said so many good and bad things, but she didn’t listen to us. Don’t blame yourself.””

“CEN Yueya said, “Third sister is right, Mom. You Can’t blame anyone for this. If you want to blame someone, blame yourself.””

Cen Yuying also walked over to comfort Zhou Xiang.

“After being comforted by her daughters, Zhou Xiang’s mood was also much better.”

The next day.

Song Chenyu brought a congratulatory gift to celebrate Cen Yuyan and Zhou Rui’s marriage.

“Cen Yuyan smiled and hugged song Chenyu. “Chenyu, thank you.””

“After the Cen family broke off their relationship with her, her former good friends had also blacklisted her. Now, only song Chenyu was left.”

“Song Chenyu continued, “The marriage certificate has been received. When are you guys planning to hold the wedding?””

“CEN Yuyan said, “This little fellow is so annoying. I’ve been throwing up so much these past few days. It’s definitely not possible to hold the wedding in the first three months. It Won’t look good in a wedding dress in the next three months, so I plan to hold the wedding after the child is born.””

“Anyway, the marriage certificate had already been received. The wedding was just a formality.”

Song Chenyu nodded. “That works too.”

“As time passed, Cen Yuyan’s stomach was also getting bigger bit by bit. However, the Cen family had no intention of sending Cen Yuyan back.”

Zhou Rui couldn’t wait any longer.

“Not to mention Zhou Rui, even song Chenyu couldn’t sit still anymore.”

“In the past, she only supported Zhou Rui alone, but now, she had to support both Zhou Rui and Cen Yuyan.”

“It was easy to go from frugality to extravagance, but difficult to go from extravagance to frugality.”

“Cen Yuyan was used to being pampered and pampered in the Cen family. Although she had already left the Cen family, she still spent money lavishly.”

“During pregnancy, due to the effects of hormones and neuroendocrine, a pregnant woman’s appearance and figure would also undergo a great change.”

“In just four short months, CEN Yuyan seemed to have changed into a different person.”

“Her figure was out of shape and her face was swollen. She was not young to begin with, and at this moment, all of her shortcomings were exposed.”

Zhou Rui was only twenty-one years old. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“In the past, he could barely deal with Cen Yuyan, but now, as long as he saw Cen Yuyan’s face, he felt like vomiting.”

“Slowly, Zhou Rui began to stay out at night. Sometimes, he would not even come back for a few days.”

“In order to prevent Cen Yuyan from suspecting that she was secretly eating outside, Zhou Rui explained that he was too busy at the company and needed to work overtime.”

“Cen Yuyan felt very tired, but she had no choice but to persevere.”

Because she believed that Zhou Rui loved her!

“As long as Zhou Rui loved her, she was willing to do anything.”

Cen Yueya made an appointment with Ye Zhuo to go shopping together.

“At 10:30, Ye Zhuo arrived at the appointed place on time.”

“Cen Yueya wore a pair of sunglasses and waved at ye Zao. “Zao Zao, over here.””

Ye Zao jogged over. “Second sister.”

“Cen Yueya held ye Zao’s hand. “Zao Zao, it’s been a long time. You’ve lost weight again!””

“As she spoke, CEN Yueya’s gaze inadvertently swept behind ye Zao. She was stunned and her eyes were filled with disbelief.”

What did she see?

Who was that?

Cen Yuyan?

That middle-aged woman who was drinking milk tea was Cen Yuyan?

“Cen Yueya rubbed her eyes and looked over again, but her gaze did not change.”

“”Second sister, What’s Wrong?”Ye Zhuo looked back at Cen Yueya.”

“Cen Yueya covered her mouth and looked in Cen Yuyan’s direction. “That, that’s Yuyan?””

Ye Zhuo looked up and was stunned. “It seems to be her.”

“It had only been a few months, but Cen Yuyan seemed to have aged more than ten years. Her figure was completely out of shape. Not only was her face swollen, but there were also many freckles.”

She looked very old.

It made people sigh endlessly.

“At this moment, Cen Yuyan also saw Cen Yueya not far away.”

“However, she did not want to greet Cen Yueya.”

“From the moment Old Madam Cen moved her out of the Cen family’s household register, she had no relationship with the Cen family.”

Only Zhou Rui and the Zhou family’s parents were her family.

“Yuyan!”Cen Yueya called out to Cen Yuyan.

Cen Yuyan pretended not to hear and continued walking forward.

“Cen Yueya jogged after her. “Yuyan, I’m calling you! Didn’t you hear me?””

“”Hear what?”Cen Yuyan frowned slightly. “Second Miss Cen, have you forgotten that we are no longer related?””

“Cen Yueya took a deep breath. “I didn’t come here to quarrel with you! Let Me Ask You, how did you become like this? Did Zhou Rui Bully You? I’ve said long ago that Zhou Rui is unreliable! You refused to listen! Now, regret it!””
