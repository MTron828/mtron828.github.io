“Although father Xu did not have much business sense, he was more clever than anyone else. ”

He ziteng was originally a rich husband that everyone had their eyes on. Who knew how many socialite daughters in the capital wanted to work for him!

“If Xu Xiao did not act special, it would be impossible for her to capture he ziteng’s heart! ”

“If she wanted he ziteng to marry Xu Xiao, Xu Xiao would have to have exceptional qualities. ”

“Mother Xu immediately understood what she meant and smiled, “What you said makes sense.” ”

“After she said that, mother Xu turned to look at Xu Xiao and continued, “Xiao Xiao, did you hear what your father said? You have to seize this opportunity to firmly capture he ziteng’s heart!” ”

“As long as she could marry he ziteng, Xu Xiao would have nothing to say to him. ”

“Xu Xiao smiled and said, “I don’t need you to say that.” ”

“”If your daughter doesn’t have the ability, can he ziteng take the initiative to confess to me?” ”

“He ziteng’s family background was good, and his looks were very good. There were more than ten women who took the initiative to confess to him, but there was really no woman who could make he ziteng take the initiative to confess to her! ”

Xu Xiao was the first!

“Mother Xu looked at Xu Xiao, and her eyes were full of superiority. “My Daughter is amazing!” ”

“”What are you talking about?”At this moment, Xu Chaonan’s voice suddenly came from the air. ”

“Xu Xiao immediately went up and said with a smile, “Aunt.” ”

Xu Chaonan nodded. “What were you guys talking about just now?” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Xu Xiao did not say anything, but mother Xu said with a smile, “We were talking about Xiaoxiao! Chaonan, let me tell you, your eldest niece is doing well!” ”

“What do you mean?”Asked Xu Chaonan.

“Mother Xu said, “Do you know who is chasing after our Xiaoxiao?” ”

“”Who?”Hearing that someone was chasing after Xu Xiaoxiao, Xu Chaonan subconsciously frowned. In her opinion, Xu Xiaoxiao was still young and not suitable for a relationship. ”

“The most important thing in a girl’s life was not to get married and have children, but to live her own life. ”

To make her life more exciting.

How Old was Xu Xiao?

She was only 21 years old and had not even graduated from university.

“Mother Xu said, “It’s he ziteng!” ”

“He Ziteng?”Xu Chaonan asked.

“”Yes.”Mother Xu continued, “What your brother and I mean is to let Xiao Xiao take good advantage of he ziteng, this rich son-in-law.” ”

“”Xiao Xiao is only 21 years old this year. There’s no hurry about getting married. We’ll talk about it after she finishes her studies,”Xu Chaonan said. ”

“When the mountain topples, everyone runs. ”

“The He family was not bad, but it was not Xu Xiaoxiao’s own property. ”

What if he ziteng got tired of Xu Xiaoxiao one day? Where would Xu Xiaoxiao go?

“Hearing this, mother Xu frowned slightly. “Why? Aren’t you happy that your niece has found a good home?” ”

“”Sister-in-law, that’s not what I meant.”Xu Chaonan turned to look at mother Xu, “I just feel that Xiao Xiao’s current age is not suitable for finding a boyfriend. Of course, if Xiao Xiao insists on her own choice, I will also give her my blessings.” ”

“Mother Xu was originally quite happy, but after hearing Xu Chaonan’s words, she felt a knot in her heart. ”

“From Xu Chaonan’s words, it was clear that he did not approve of Xu Xiao finding a boyfriend! ”

“She was an old lady who could not get married, and now she had to stop her niece from getting married! ”

How could there be such an aunt in the world!

“If it were not for the fact that Xu Chaonan held the financial power in the Xu family, mother Xu would not even want to look at Xu Chaonan. ”

Mother Xu hid the dissatisfaction in her eyes.

“”Big Brother and sister-in-law, I still have something to do. I’ll go back to the study first.” ”

Mother Xu nodded. “Go and do your work. I’ll get the kitchen to make bird’s nest. I’ll get Aunt Zhang to send it to you later.”

“”Okay,”Xu Chaonan replied. He then looked at Father Xu. “Big Brother, Xiaoxiao is going to get married and have children soon. You’re still the same!” ”

“Father Xu smiled at Xu Chaonan. “Don’t worry, Chaonan. I rarely go to gate three these days. If you don’t believe me, you can ask your sister-in-law.” ”

Gate three was a famous gambling mecca in the capital.

Father Xu would contribute 10 to 20 million to gate three every year.

“Hearing this, mother Xu immediately nodded. “Superman, I can testify for your brother. He has indeed rarely gone to gate three recently!” ”

“Xu Chaonan sighed. “Sister-in-law, just protect him!” ”

Mother Xu smiled apologetically.

“If it wasn’t for the fact that she was forced by life, as her sister-in-law, who would be willing to be so humble in front of her sister-in-law? ”

Xu Chaonan didn’t say anything more. He turned around and walked upstairs.

“When Xu Chaonan’s figure completely disappeared into the air, mother xu snorted coldly, “Bah! Who are you putting on airs for!” ”

“”Dad, my aunt doesn’t seem to approve of me finding a boyfriend.”Xu Xiao looked at Father Xu. ”

“”Who does she think she is? I don’t care about her,”father Xu said. ”
