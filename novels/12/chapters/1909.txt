“Moreover, Cen Shaoqing was Li Sanzhu’s guest. On account of Li Sanzhu, Cen Shaoqing did not deny it! ”

Would Cen Shaoqing just watch as she was wrongly accused of being a prostitute?

No Way!

“No matter what kind of man, he had a tender heart. ”

“She was so beautiful, Cen Shaoqing might even notice her. ”

“Thinking of this, Li Shuyi heaved a sigh of relief. ”

“Hearing this, officer Wang and officer Yin looked at each other and saw doubt in each other’s eyes. ”

Could it really be that they were mistaken? L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“The police also paid attention to evidence when handling cases. The public reported that someone was selling yin here, and they had collected a lot of evidence at the scene. They could not let Li Shuyi go just because of her one-sided words. ”

“”Don’t worry. We, the People’s police, will not malign a good person, and we will not let a bad person go. We will verify with the owner of this room. If the investigation is clear and it is indeed a misunderstanding, we will definitely let you go.” ”

“Hearing this, Li Shuyi was about to cry. ”

She was only wearing a blanket and was being detained by the police.

“Since she was young, when had she ever lost her face like this! ”

“Walking outside the house, Li Shuyi wished she could find a hole to hide in. ”

“She saw Li Yueyue, Li Sanzhu, Fang yinyue, the butler, and some servants standing outside the house to watch the show. ”

Their eyes were like knives.

One knife after another!

Li Shuyi was very uncomfortable.

“She was caught in the act of seducing someone, and now she was called to the police... ”

She had lost all her face!

What should she do now?

“Looking at the extremely disheveled Li Shuyi, Li Sanzhu, Fang yinyue, and Li Yueyue, the three of them, were a little confused. ”

Didn’t they say that the Streetwalker went to the wrong room?

Why was the person they brought out Li Shuyi?

“Most importantly, Li Shuyi wasn’t dressed properly. She looked like she was wrapped in a blanket. ”

Why would Li Shuyi appear in Cen Shaoqing’s room dressed like this.

Could it be that she...

Fang yinyue narrowed her eyes and immediately figured out the whole story.

“In fact, she had already seen through the thoughts of the mother and daughter during the day. However, she had not expected that Li Shuyi would be so bold as to dare to provoke CEN fifth master. ”

She would be in big trouble this time.

It was a disgrace.

Li Sanzhu was even more furious.

Stupid!

It was simply too stupid.

He had always thought that his niece was just a little proud. He did not expect her to do such a thing.

Cen Shaoqing was his honored guest.

“Li Shuyi did this not only to embarrass herself, but also to prevent her from seeing Cen Shaoqing and Ye Zhuo. ”

“After all, he was Li Shuyi’s elder. ”

Li Sanzhu frowned tightly.

“His second brother and second sister-in-law were not stupid people, how could they let Li Shuyi do such a thing! ”

“Quickly go and call my second brother and second sister-in-law over.”Li Sanzhu looked at the servant beside him.

“After such a thing happened, as parents, Li Erzhu and Linda could not be cowards. ”

They had to stand up.

“”Okay.”The servant nodded. “Please Wait a moment, I’ll go now.” ”

The maid immediately ran to Li Erzhu’s residence.

Officer Wang took a step forward and looked at the crowd. “Which one of you is staying in this room?”

“Our Master Five.”The assistant stepped forward to answer.

“Officer Wang had received a message before he went to the police station, so he naturally knew Cen Shaoqing’s identity. He immediately walked over and said, “This lady claims to be Master Five’s girlfriend. May I ask if the matter is as she said?” ”

“If Li Shuyi was really Cen Shaoqing’s girlfriend, then the matter would be a little difficult to handle. ”

CEN fifth master’s girlfriend was mistaken for a streetwalker and was even handcuffed. The result was obvious.

“Hearing this, Li Yueyue was stunned. ”

She did not expect that Li Shuyi could actually say such a thing.

Girlfriend?

How could she have the face to say such a thing?

This was too shameless!

It simply refreshed her worldview.

Li Yueyue had never known that Li Shuyi had such a side to her.

“If she had not seen it with her own eyes, she would never have believed it. ”

Li Shuyi looked at Cen Shaoqing with anticipation and affection.

Cen Shaoqing had been facing ye Zhuo’s face the entire time. He might have gotten sick of it long ago!

“Therefore, Cen Shaoqing would definitely continue to listen to her. ”

She was his girlfriend!

Cen Shaoqing lowered his eyes slightly and looked at officer Wang. His deep voice was filled with coldness. “Is she worthy?”

“It was a very simple word, but it was so powerful that it made one’s heart tremble. ”

She was a beautiful flower that bloomed in the dust. She had been looking forward to Cen Shaoqing

Li Shuyi’s hopeful eyes instantly turned gloomy.
