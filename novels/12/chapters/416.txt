“Old Granny Cen said angrily, “I dreamt last night that this brat had become a scumbag in the novel! He was fickle and even misunderstood my granddaughter-in-law!” ”

“Zhou Xiang’s face turned stern. “Shaoqing, this is your fault! As a man, you must be responsible and responsible! How can you be fickle and fickle! Don’t blame your grandmother for hitting you!” ”

Cen Shaoqing:”...”he was going to take the blame.

The two of them lectured Cen Shaoqing with a stern face before letting him go to eat.

“At 9:30, the low-key Cayenne stopped at the downstairs of the Ye family’s apartment building. ”

“Ye Zhuo saw Cen Shaoqing’s car through the balcony. He stood on the balcony and waved at him. “Fifth brother, come in quickly!” ”

Ye Shu and Ye Sen were both at home.

“Because of the incident in country P, Ye Sen’s attitude towards Cen Shaoqing had completely changed. ”

“In the past, no matter how he looked at Cen Shaoqing, he always felt that he was a playboy. ”

“Now, no matter how he looked at Cen Shaoqing, he felt that he was like his great nephew-in-law. ”

“”Shaoqing is here. Sit Down, sit down! Have you eaten? If you haven’t eaten, sit down and eat together!” ”

“”Thank you, Mr. Ye.”Cen Shaoqing held the Buddha bead in his hand. “I’ve already eaten.” ”

“Ye Sen smiled and said, “What Mr. Ye? You’re too polite! You’re Searing’s friend, just like searing. Just call me uncle!” ”

“Ye Shu, who was at the side, was stunned and raised her head to look at the two people. ”

She remembered that ye Sen used to be very resistant to Cen Shaoqing.

But now...

He suddenly treated Cen Shaoqing so well.

Ye Sen did not tell ye Shu about what happened in country P because he was afraid that ye Shu would be worried.

“Ye Zao knew everything that ye Shu did not know. He added, “That’s right, fifth brother. You can call me uncle with me.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing’s eyes flashed when he heard this. He immediately called out, “Uncle.” ”

“”Good, good, good!”Ye Sen was overjoyed. He continued, “Shaoqing, did you come here to look for Zhonghua?” ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “I did ask her out.”

“Ye Sen quickly stood up and said, “Zhonghua, since you have an appointment with Shaoqing, the two of you should hurry up and leave! Don’t Dawdle at home!” ”

Ye Sen pushed ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing out.

“”Wait, I need to change my shoes.”Ye Zhuo was still wearing slippers. ”

“Then go and change quickly! Don’t make Shaoqing Wait!”

“After changing his shoes, Ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing went out together. ”

“Inside the house, Ye Shu held ye Sen’s hand and asked in puzzlement, “What are you up to?” ”

“Ye Sen turned to look at ye Shu and whispered, “Sister, don’t you think that Zhuozhuo and Shaoqing are a good match?” ”

“”They are a good match...”at this point, ye Shu frowned. “But Shaoqing seems to be much older than Shaoqing, right?” ”

“”Not much! She’s only 11 years old! A 31-year-old man is really at the age of 30! It’s also the best time of his life! “Besides, do you think Shaoqing looks like a 31-year-old?”Ye Sen continued, “Besides, she only knows how to dote on others when she’s older! Our family’s Zhuluo is already very powerful. Look at her peers, how many of them are worthy of her? This is called a strong team, and they’re evenly matched!” ”

“Ye Sen continued, “Moreover, you’ve also seen the old lady of the Cen family. She’s such a kind old lady. If she likes Zhuluo so much, after we marry her, her family will definitely hold her in their hands!” ”

“”Also! Shaoqing is a good child. When the time comes, the person in charge will definitely be our Zha Zha!” ”

Ye Shu was a little confused.

It sounded like it was true.

“After thinking for a while, ye Shu continued, “But Zha Zha is only nineteen this year. I don’t want her to get married so early.” ”

“Ye Sen looked at Ye Shu, “Sister, I Just Want Zha Zha Zha to fall in love with Shaoqing first. I’m not asking them to get married immediately! “You see, this is a good example. When he was young, he did not fall in love properly. Now, when he wants to find a girlfriend, he has been lied to twice in a row!”! “I know Shaoqing’s character very well. He would never lie to searing!” ”

Ye Shu’s heart wavered little by little.

She felt that Ye Sen’s words were quite reasonable. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“In the end, the most important thing in a relationship was character. Back then, she had suffered a loss because she did not know the other party’s character! ”

Cen Shaoqing’s external and internal conditions were both good. He could indeed make ye Zhuo consider it.

“Seeing that ye Shu was wavering bit by bit, Ye Sen let out a long sigh of relief. ”

On the other side.

Cen Shaoqing brought ye Zhuo to a sugar water shop.

“This sugar water shop was in the bustling old city district. The owner was an old couple. When they were young, they had taken over the sugar water shop from their parents. It had been more than forty years now. ”
