She was wearing a flawless white wedding dress and had exquisite makeup on her face. She smiled beautifully and her beautiful eyes were filled with anticipation. Her entire person was extremely beautiful.

“In a trance, Lin Ze seemed to have returned to the day he first met her. ”

“In a moment, Lin Ze knelt down on one knee and handed the bouquet to Bai Jingshu. “Jingshu, marry me.” ”

“As soon as he said this, the crowd immediately erupted in applause. ”

“It was a blessing, but it was also awe-inspiring. ”

“This awe was, of course, due to Lin Ze’s identity. ” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“After all, Lin Ze would be the heir to the Shangguan family in the future. ”

“If he did not have this identity, there would definitely not be such warm applause. ”

“At this moment, Bai Jingshu was also a little puzzled. She did not understand why there was such a huge difference between the front and back. ”

“After all, an hour ago, they were still laughing at her for marrying an earthling. However, in the blink of an eye, they were actually able to bless them and clap. This did not seem right. ”

Did Something Happen?

“However, at this moment, there was no time for Bai Jingshu to think too much because words like ‘marry him’and ‘marry him’had already sounded in the air. ”

“Bai Jingshu looked at Lin Ze, who was kneeling in front of her. She reached out to take the flowers and nodded. “Okay.” ”

The words ‘give me a kiss’immediately rang in the air.

“No one knew who was leading the tempo, but in short, the atmosphere was controlled very well. Compared to the cold and cheerless scene just now, Bai Jingshu felt as if she was dreaming. ”

What was going on?

She had been sitting in the room the whole time and didn’t know that Lin Ze had become the heir of the Shangguan family.

“Just as Bai Jingshu was slightly stunned, Lin Ze lowered his head and kissed Bai Jingshu on the side of her face. ”

Bai Jingshu’s face instantly turned red.

It was impossible to say that she didn’t feel anything in front of so many people.

“Seeing this scene, old master Bai couldn’t put on any expression. ”

“Bai Sanfeng walked to Old Master Bai’s side and comforted him, “Jingshu just got married. It’s not like she’s not coming back. You Don’t have to be so sad.”Bai Sanfeng was also filled with emotions. She had never dreamed that.., bai Jingshu had actually met a dead rat by accident. ”

“Not only did Bai Jingshu not marry the wrong person, she married the right person! ”

“In the s galaxy, who else could marry the future heir of the Shangguan Family? ”

“Hearing Bai Sanfeng’s words, Bai Jingshu was even more surprised. ”

What exactly happened?

Why did even Bai Sanfeng Change?

One had to know that Bai Sanfeng was the one who had just said those harsh words.

It was really too strange!

“The relatives at the side all walked over to comfort old master Bai, and there was even an envious tone in their words. ”

“Jingshu really married into a good family! Why doesn’t our Huan Huan have such good fortune!”

“”Fourth granduncle, Congratulations!” ”

“Looking at the people surrounding old master Bai and flattering him, Bai Jingshu almost doubted her life. ”

Was she really not dreaming?

“At this moment, Old Lady Shangguan walked over, held Bai Jingshu’s hand, and placed it on Lin Ze’s hand. “Jingshu, from now on, you and Ah Ze will be husband and wife. Grandma hopes that the two of you will live in harmony and be together for the rest of your life, hugging each other for three years.” ”

Grandma?

Bai Jingshu was a little puzzled. Didn’t Old Lady Lin already pass away?

Then who was this person who claimed to be Grandma?

“Although she was puzzled, Bai Jingshu did not show it on her face. She smiled and said, “Thank you, Grandma.” ”

“”Good Boy.”Old Lady Shangguan nodded in satisfaction and removed the blood bracelet from her wrist onto Bai Jingshu’s hand, “This is the Shangguan family’s heirloom jade bracelet. It has always been passed down to the future mistress of the Shangguan family. Today, I will pass it down to you.” ”

The Shangguan Family?

Could it be the Shangguan family of Galaxy F?

But how did she become the future mistress of the Shangguan Family?

Could she accept this bracelet?

“Thinking of this, Bai Jingshu looked up at Lin Ze. ”

“Lin Ze nodded slightly, indicating for Bai Jingshu to accept it. ”

“Receiving Lin Ze’s gaze, Bai Jingshu immediately thanked him. “Thank you, Grandmother.” ”

“Seeing the blood bracelet on Bai Jingshu’s wrist, everyone’s eyes widened in shock. ”

“Firstly, she had yet to recover from the fact that Lin Ze was the heir to the Shangguan family, and secondly, she could not believe that Bai Jingshu had actually won the favor of old Lady Shangguan just like that. ”

That was the blood bracelet!

It was the heirloom of the Shangguan family.

“Especially Bai Mo, her eyes almost spat fire. ”

That was her bracelet!

The blood bracelet was hers!

Who Was Bai Jingshu?

“If not for her, how could Bai Jingshu have bonded with Lin Ze? ”
