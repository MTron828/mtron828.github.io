Translator: 549690339

“Ai Ru’s heart was beating faster and faster, almost jumping out of her chest. ”

Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly and looked back at his assistant who was hiding beside him.

“The assistant immediately understood and walked in front of Ai Ru, making a ‘please’gesture. “I’m sorry, Madam, please leave immediately.” ”

“Hearing this, the smile on Ai Ru’s face froze on the corner of Jiang Jiang’s mouth. ”

Leave.

Cen Shaoqing wanted her to leave?

Could it be that CEN Shaoqing didn’t remember her at all?

That shouldn’t be! VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Ai Ru frowned. She was so famous in school back then. How could CEN Shaoqing not remember her at all.

Cen Shaoqing turned to look at Ye Zhuo. “Let’s go over there.”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

There was a long street behind the ancestral hall.

On both sides of the street were vagabonds selling goods and grassland specialties.

“As Ye Zao walked, he said, “Why didn’t you say hello to your classmate just now?” ”

“”I’m not familiar with him,”Cen Shaoqing said concisely. ”

He never had much to say to people he was not familiar with.

“Most importantly, he hated having too much contact with girls other than ye Zao. ”

“Before he met ye Zao, this situation was even more serious. ”

“Ye Zao’s gaze was attracted by the handmade items on the side. He picked up a handmade wallet and said, “This is so beautiful. Shall we buy one for Grandma?” ”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

Ye Zao bought a small wallet and some other souvenirs.

On the other side.

“Ai Ru stood where she was, feeling a little upset. ”

Li Shuyi was immediately stunned.

She had never expected that the one living in Li Yueyue’s house was actually fifth master Cen.

“Thinking of how she had ignored AI ru a few days ago, Li Shuyi wished she could slap that stupid herself to death. ”

“If she had known that that person was fifth master Cen, Li Shuyi would definitely not have done that. ”

It was too late to say anything now.

“No, she couldn’t. ”

She couldn’t give up so quickly.

Li Shuyi narrowed her eyes and ignored AI ru. She walked straight to the other side.

“Very soon, she came to Linda’s side. ”

“Li Shuyi told Linda about what had happened just now. Hearing this, Linda’s expression was also quite interesting. “What! Fifth Master Cen!” ”

“Yes.”Li Shuyi nodded.

“Are you sure?”Linda asked.

She was the same as Li Shuyi. She did not believe that the Li family would know a nobleman like fifth master Cen.

Birds of a feather flock together. They were not on the same level at all.

“Li Shuyi said, “Ai ru personally greeted him. How could I have seen wrongly!” ”

“Linda narrowed her eyes. “No Wonder Fang yinyue was unwilling to let Li Yueyue marry your cousin. It turns out that she has other motives.”Although the Jones family was a noble family in country C, there was still a gap between them and fifth master Cen. ”

Fang Yueyin’s chess game was really big.

“”Mom, you mean...” ”

“Mm.”Linda nodded.

“Thinking of this, Li Shuyi’s face was full of unwillingness. ”

Why!

“Li Yueyue was just a little village girl who was inferior to her in everything. Why was Li Yueyue able to marry Fifth Master Cen? She was a hundred times, a thousand times better than Li Yueyue! ”

“Linda glanced at Li Shuyi. The two of them were mother and daughter. Of course, she knew what Li Shuyi was thinking. ”

“”Let’s go back first,”Linda suddenly said. ”

“Okay.”Li Shuyi nodded.

“After a while, the two returned to their residence. ”

Li Sanzhu sat in the living room and watched TV.

“Although the heaven worship ceremony was being held outside and all the descendants of the Li family had to attend, he was no longer a member of the Li family. ”

“He married and had children abroad, and his family was also abroad. He had nothing to do with China. ”

“Why are you back so early?”Li Erzhu looked at the mother and son curiously.

“Linda said, “You go and pack up. We’ll go to your brother’s house for the New Year at night.” ”

“Go to Sanzhu’s house for the New Year?”Li Erzhu looked at Linda with surprise. “Did I hear wrong?”

“Linda didn’t directly answer Li Erzhu’s words, but continued, “Where’s the wine you brought back from C Country?”Li Erzhu was a wine addict, and he liked to collect all kinds of good wine, including a bottle of good wine worth six figures, he had brought back this time, but he couldn’t bear to drink it. ”

“What do you want the wine for?”Li Erzhu looked at Linda vigilantly.

“Linda continued, “Don’t you Chinese people pay attention to reciprocity? We’re going to your brother’s house for New Year’s Eve dinner. Are we going to go there empty-handed?” ”

“Seeing that she didn’t seem to be joking, Li Erzhu continued, “Are you really going to Sanzhu’s house for New Year’s Eve Dinner?” ”

“Yes.”Linda nodded. “Go and get the wine.”
