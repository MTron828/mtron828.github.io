“An hour later, ye Zhuo returned to the CEN base and drove to the hospital. ”

The assistant drove very fast.

“Ten minutes later, he arrived at the hospital. ”

“The assistant went to the front desk of the hospital and asked he ziteng’s room number. Then, he went over with Ye Zhuo. ”

“In the ward, ever since they learned that ye Zhuo was coming over, the He family’s parents had been looking forward to it. ”

“Very soon, the sound of footsteps could be heard from outside the ward. “Hello.” ”

This voice.

It must be Miss Ye.

“Because other than Miss Ye, no one else would come at this time. ”

The He family’s parents immediately looked up.

Mi Chen and Xu Yao also looked up.

In the next second.

Mi Chen almost laughed out loud.

He had thought that the legendary miss ye was some kind of God.

So it turned out that she was just a big fatty who weighed 300 to 400 pounds.

It was simply disgusting.

The He family’s parents still looked very respectful. “May I ask if you’re Miss Ye?”

The person who came was stunned. “Miss Ye? Who’s Miss Ye?”

“After saying that, the person looked around the ward and seemed to have discovered something. He continued, “I’m sorry, I’ve entered the Wrong Room! Sorry to disturb you!” ”

So he had entered the wrong room.

The He family’s parents’faces were filled with disappointment.

When would the real miss ye arrive.

An hour had already passed.

“Seeing the anxiety in the He family’s parents’eyes, Xu Yao passed them two cups of water. “Uncle, Auntie, don’t be too anxious. Miss ye is already on her way. She should be arriving soon.” ”

“Okay.”Father and mother he received the water from Xu Yao and nodded.

Mi Chen looked in the direction of the door and narrowed her eyes.

Over here.

“Not long after, Ye Zhuo and assistant Xiao Shen walked to he ziteng’s ward. ” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The door to the ward was open.

“However, the assistant still knocked on the door politely and asked, “Excuse me, is this he Gong’s ward?” ”

“Hearing that, the He family’s parents immediately stood up in excitement. “Yes, yes, yes! We’re He Ziteng’s parents!” ”

It seemed that this was the legendary Miss Ye.

Mi Chen raised her head and looked at the person in front of her very seriously.

“She was about 1.6 meters tall and her looks were average. She couldn’t be said to be ugly, but she couldn’t be said to be good-looking either. At most, she could only make up the numbers. Her skin was a little yellow, and there was a pimple on her chin. ”

“Mi Chen had originally been filled with anticipation for the legendary Miss Ye, but in the end... ”

That was it?

Xu Yao glanced at the person who had come and didn’t look at him again.

“Usually, she would hear about miss ye from he ziteng’s mouth. ”

She had thought that Miss Ye was very beautiful.

She didn’t expect her looks to be so average.

It wasn’t even one-tenth as good-looking as her.

“”Hello, Mr. and Mrs. He. My surname is Shen, and I’m Miss Ye’s assistant.”As soon as she finished speaking, assistant Xiao Shen took a step back and continued, “This is Miss Ye.” ”

Ye Zhuo walked in from outside the door.

“She was in a hurry and did not change her clothes. She was wearing a black knee-length woolen coat and a pair of Martin boots of the same color. Her facial features were as exquisite as jade, her eyes were bright and her teeth were white. She was devastatingly beautiful. ”

It made people want to use the most beautiful words in the world on her.

Because she was really too beautiful!

“Black was originally a very dark color. If the skin was slightly darker, it would be made dull by the black. ”

“When Black was worn on her body, not only was it bright and moving, but it was also full of aura. ”

Even the professional models on the runway were inferior by more than three times.

For a moment.

Everyone was stunned.

Especially Mi Chen.

He originally thought that ye Zhuo was a very ordinary person.

He did not expect that the person who came would be so stunning.

“Even Xu Yao, this woman, was stunned. ”

A moment later.

Xu Yao felt that ye Zao’s face was somewhat familiar.

“The next second, she recalled the scene of someone throwing cold water on her head. Although it was a long time ago, when she thought about it now, her face was still burning hot. ”

Because it was too embarrassing!

Xu Yao did not expect that Miss ye would be like her. She immediately lowered her head.

“Back then, the matter between her and ye Zao had blown up so much. Ye Zao must still have an impression of her. ”

“Fortunately, ye Zao did not look at her. He walked directly to the he family’s parents and said in a clear and shallow tone, “Hello, I’m Ye Zao.” ”

Her aura was really too strong. It shocked the he family’s parents so much that they could not speak for a long time.

He ziteng was originally in a daze.

“When he heard ye Zao’s voice, he immediately woke up. ”

Ye Zao.

It was ye Zao.

Ye Zao had finally arrived.

He was saved!

“In a moment, he ziteng’s parents reacted. “Miss Ye, I’m He Ziteng’s mother. This is his father! Ziteng is our only child. You must save her.” ”

Even though ye Zao looked very young.
