“Even if the police were called, it would be useless for a debt dispute. ”

“Hearing this, Carl turned to look at ye Zao with doubt in his eyes. ”

That’s impossible!

“Ye Zao had won more than that in ranito casino, so how could he owe someone 50 million! ”

“Obviously, this person was here to pick a fight! ”

What should he do?

Carl looked at himself and then looked up at Scarface who was covered in fat. It was obvious that he was no match for Scarface.

But there was no need to worry.

“Even Yaler was no match for ye Zao, let alone this Scarface in front of him. ”

“Thinking of this, Carl turned to look at Ye Zao. ”

“He saw ye Zao slowly put the beer glass on the table, as if he did not hear Scarface’s words, and continued to eat the kebabs. ”

He was extremely calm.

“Seeing how calm ye Zao was, Carl was not worried at all. He imitated ye Zao and picked up a kebab, eating it while drinking beer. ”

“Seeing that ye Zao actually ignored his existence, Scarface was so angry that his face turned green. He picked up the dessert that ye Zao had just ordered and threw it on the ground. ”

PA!

“Then, Scarface picked up the beer bottle on the table and smashed it at Ye Zao’s head. ”

“Seeing that the beer bottle was about to hit ye Zao’s head, ye Zao stood up, grabbed Scarface’s hand with one hand, and picked up the beer bottle on the table with the other hand, and smashed it directly on Scarface’s head. ”

“The moment the beer bottle exploded, there was a loud sound. ”

Bang!

“The posture was a little handsome, and Carl was so excited that he wanted to whistle. ”

Scarface only felt a tearing pain on his scalp. The air was filled with the smell of blood and beer.

“The next second, he was kicked in the knee. Scarface was kicked to the ground by this sudden force. He grimaced in pain. ”

“”Didn’t your mother teach you to cherish food?”Ye Zhuo looked down at Scarface and said coldly, “Pick it up and eat it!” ”

Ye Zao hated people who wasted food the most in his life.

Perhaps the feeling of being so hungry that one’s chest was pressed against one’s back could only be understood by those who had experienced it.

“Earth’s resources were limited. If humans did not cherish food and protect the environment, sooner or later, they would have to pay the price. ”

“Scarface knelt on the ground, his face full of disbelief. ”

He did not expect that an unarmed little girl would be so skilled.

No wonder secretary Zhang kept reminding him to be careful.

Little did he know that Secretary Zhang was also stunned. He could not believe his eyes.

He was knocked down.

Ye Zhuo had actually knocked down Scarface.

What should he do now?

Secretary Zhang quickly picked up the phone on the table and left in a hurry. He could not bring trouble to himself.

“Scarface was a gangster. Since he was in the underworld, he should know the rules of the underworld. ”

Secretary Zhang reported to Jin Yuyan as he walked.

Scarface kneeled on the ground and felt better. He reached for the gun at his waist.

“No matter how powerful this little girl was, she had to surrender in front of the gun! ”

Scarface took out the gun and ye Zhuo kicked his wrist. A sharp pain hit him and the gun in his hand was thrown out.

Ye Zao reached out and caught the gun. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Then, a cold muzzle was pressed against Scarface’s head. ”

“Seeing this, Carl immediately stood up and blocked her view. He took out his phone and started the black surveillance. ”

“Scarface’s face instantly turned pale, and his back was covered with layers of cold sweat. ”

“Ye Zao slowly pulled the trigger and opened his red lips, “I told you to pick up the things and eat them.” ”

“”Eat, I’ll eat! I’ll eat right away!”Scarface’s voice was trembling. He had been in the underworld for so many years and had always pointed a gun at someone’s head. This was the first time someone had pointed a gun at his head. ”

It was not a good feeling to have your life in someone else’s hands.

Scarface was regretting it now.

He regretted not listening to Secretary Zhang’s words.

“At this moment, a clear and shallow voice sounded in the air again, “Two minutes.” ”

Two Minutes?

Scarface was stunned for a moment and looked up at Ye Zao.

“For a moment, he did not understand what ye Zao meant. ”

“One minute and 58 seconds.”

Only then did Scarface realize that ye Zao meant to let him eat the cake on the ground within two minutes.

“”I’ll eat it now! Please don’t be angry. Anger is not only bad for the liver, it’s also easy for the gun to go off!”Scarface quickly picked up the dessert on the ground. He didn’t care about the dirt and swallowed it in big mouthfuls. ”
