“Chapter 1202: 257: Trash, Zhao Xueyin has been thrown out! The rightful heir of the consortium! 4”

Translator: 549690339

“Zhao Xueyin raised her head to look at Father Zhao. “Who am I? Dragons give birth to dragons, phoenixes give birth to Phoenixes. When you ask me what I Am, why don’t you think about yourself?” ”

“If she was worse than a dog, how could father Zhao be any better? ”

“When the upper beam is not upright, the lower beam is crooked. ”

Father Zhao took a deep breath. “You! You! You Bastard!”

PA —

Father Zhao was so angry that he lost his mind and directly gave Zhao Xueyin a slap.

Father Zhao didn’t hit women.

“Therefore, ever since she was young, Zhao Xueyin had never been hit by Father Zhao. ”

This was the first time.

“Her head was hit so hard that it slanted to the side, and blood seeped out from the corner of her mouth. ” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Ha.”

“Zhao Xueyin didn’t cry. Instead, a trace of a smile appeared on the corner of her mouth, “Ever since I was young, other than striking me down and giving me negative energy, what else can you do? When I was at school, other children had their parents attend parent-teacher conferences. What about me? What do I have? My mother is dead. My father is better off dead than alive!” ”

“A long, long time ago, Zhao Xueyin had also longed for her father’s love. ”

“Later on, she experienced more and more disappointments. ”

She no longer longed for it.

“Other children’s parents will bring them to participate in parent-child activities at school. What will my father do? My father will only despise why I’m not a boy? !”

“But I’m not a son. Can this be blamed on me? Can I choose my own gender?”

“”Why did I become like this? “I still don’t want your approval!”! “I want to prove to you that even though I’m a girl, I’m not inferior to a boy!”! “That’s why I want to marry master five so much. I want you to become the envy of everyone in the financial world!” ”

“But what about you? What have you done?”

“At the end of her sentence, Zhao Xueyin was almost hysterical. ”

Tired.

Too tired.

“All these years, she had been living in Father Zhao’s expectations. She was afraid that she would accidentally let down Father Zhao’s expectations. ”

“In father Zhao’s eyes, what was she? ”

She was nothing!

“If father Zhao really treated her as his daughter, he would not have let her marry the lawyer all the time. ”

What did the lawyer have?

Other fathers all hoped that their daughter would marry well.

“Father Zhao, on the other hand, hoped that she would marry poorly. ”

“If not for the paternity test, Zhao Xueyin would have thought that she had picked it up. ”

“Thinking of this, Zhao Xueyin’s eyes were full of mockery. ”

Hearing this.

Father Zhao was stunned.

He never knew that Zhao Xueyin had such a great hatred for him.

“The lawyer had to be capable, have good looks, and be easy to control. ”

How could the lawyer not be good enough for Zhao Xueyin?

People said that mother and daughter were connected.

Father and son were connected.

It was normal for Zhao Xueyin’s daughter not to understand him.

If only a Ye was here.

He and a Ye would definitely be able to connect father and son.

“At this time, he thought of Zhao Ziye again. ”

“After a while, Father Zhao let out a long sigh and turned around to walk upstairs. ”

“Zhao Xueyin looked at Father Zhao’s voice and picked up the vase on the table. Just as she was about to smash it on the ground, the Butler suddenly rushed over from the side and held her hand. “Miss! Miss, you can’t do this!” ”

Zhao Xueyin could only let go.

...

On the other side.

The lawyer came downstairs of the Jiang Corporation.

Not long after.

Jiang Xiaoyu walked out from the main door.

“”Jiang Xiaoyu,”the lawyer suddenly said. ”

Jiang Xiaoyu turned around and saw the lawyer. Her eyes were full of vigilance as she took a few steps back. “Why are you here?”

“The lawyer continued, “Don’t be nervous. I’m here to apologize to you.” ”

Apologize?

Si Lui was here to apologize to her?

It seemed a little unlikely.

“Si lui liked Zhao Xueyin so much that his eyes seemed to have been smudged by feces. He could neither see nor hear clearly. This time, he was probably here to bring her to apologize to Zhao Xueyin again. ”

“Seeing Jiang Xiaoyu like this, Si lui sighed, “Jiang Xiaoyu, I really came here to apologize to you. It was all my fault in the past. I misjudged you and misjudged Miss Ye. I almost hurt you!” ”

“At the end of his sentence, Si lui slightly bent down and bowed to Jiang Xiaoyu. ”

“From the way Si lui looked, it didn’t seem like he was acting. ”

Jiang Xiaoyu was stunned.

Did the sun rise from the West?

She didn’t expect that Si lui would have the day to see the truth.

She thought that Si lui would never be able to see the truth.

“Jiang Xiaoyu continued, “Did you break up with Zhao Xueyin?” ”

“Yes.”The lawyer nodded.

Jiang Xiaoyu raised his eyebrows slightly. “Really?”

“Yes.”

“Jiang Xiaoyu took a few steps forward, crossed his arms, and looked at the lawyer. “If you can go blind the first time, you’ll go blind the second time. Who knows if you’ll be fooled by Zhao Xueyin a second time?” ”
