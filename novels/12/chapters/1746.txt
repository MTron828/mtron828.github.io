“Chapter 1747: 360: once the burning sun strikes, you’ll be sent to prison! 3”

Translator: 549690339

“After thinking for a while, Gu si continued, “Then what do you think of the idiom ‘flies ensnare dogs’?” ”

“”Miss Gu!”Jamila said with a straight face, “I’m seriously informing you now. Please be more serious. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being impolite! Some opportunities only come once. Once you miss it, there won’t be a second time!” ” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“”Ha,”gu si snorted. “Then I’d like to see how impolite you are!” ”

“Jamila narrowed her eyes, which were filled with a layer of hostility. ”

“Gu Si was about 1.65 meters tall. Facing the tall and strong Jamila, she was still a little stunned. If Jamila really hit someone, she wouldn’t be Jamila’s match. Fortunately, this was a coffee shop.., gamila probably wouldn’t dare to make a move! ”

“”Gamila Smith, this is China. If you dare to touch a single hair on my head, you can forget about walking out of China!”Gu Si stood up from her chair. Although she wasn’t as tall as Gamila.., her aura didn’t lose out to Gamila at all.., “Although I, Gu Si, am not born into a proper family, nor am I more politically aware than Liu Yuan, I know one thing! I can not betray my country or my team at any time! I am not only a Chinese in this life, but I will also be a Chinese in my next life and my next life! Do you know what it is like to poach someone? It is called the behavior of a villain! With a villain like you in C Nation, no wonder you have never been able to develop!” ”

“Gu Si loved her country very much. Although she was not Liu Yuan and was not as outstanding as Liu Yuan, one day, she and Liu Yuan would be equally matched. ”

That was:

A patriotic heart.

She was very glad that she could be born in a loving and powerful country.

“At the moment, China was in the midst of development. As the son and daughter of China, Gu Si was very glad that she could contribute to the great rejuvenation of her country. At such a time, how could she betray her country? ! ”

“Jamila was really provoked. His eyes were red, the veins on his face were bulging, and he was so angry that his whole body was trembling. ”

He had never thought that one day he would be fooled by a Chinese.

“At this time, Jamila could not control herself. She raised her hand and was about to hit Gu si. ”

“Looking at Jamila’s raised right hand, Gu Si was stunned. She had never thought that Jamila would attack in public! ”

“Jamila was taller than her, stronger than her, and stronger than her. ”

“It was over, it was over. This time, she would definitely be at a disadvantage. ”

“There should be surveillance cameras in this coffee shop, right? ”

Gu Si was already thinking of calling the police.

“One second, two seconds. ”

“Time passed by minute by minute, but the slap that she had imagined did not fall. ”

Gu Si opened her eyes and saw that a slender figure had appeared beside her.

“It was a very simple white shirt and black pants. Her long hair was tied up into a bun and tied at the back of her head, revealing a fair and beautiful swan neck. The second button of her shirt was not buttoned, and one could vaguely see the beautifully curved collarbone hidden in the collar, looking up from the collarbone, one would see a thin chin, dark red lips, a fair and jade-like oval face, a high nose bridge that was as sharp as a knife, and a pair of soul-captivating Phoenix eyes. ”

“Her eyebrows were like a painting, and she was devastatingly beautiful. ”

“Gu Si was stunned at first, then a smile appeared on the corner of her mouth, and she said in surprise, “Miss Ye!” ”

“Ye Zao pinched Jamila’s hand and twisted it hard. Then, he used force and pressed Jamila’s head on the coffee table. ”

The whole process was so cool that it made people want to scream.

“Jamila was stunned. Stars appeared in front of her eyes, and she wanted to break free from ye Zao’s confinement, but she could not use any strength. ”

“Not only was Jamila a technologist, she was also a martial arts practitioner. She had not met an opponent for so many years, but today, she was actually pressed down on the coffee table by a little girl! ”

Wouldn’t it be a disgrace if this were to spread?

No!

She could not do this!

“Jamila struggled with all her might, but she still did not move an inch. ”

“Ye Zao held Jamila’s head with one hand and lifted the coffee cup on the table with the other. Then, he poured the boiling hot coffee on Jamila’s face. “You have such guts? Do you really think that there is no one else in China?” ”

“Ah!”Jamila shrieked from the scalding coffee.

Ye Zhuo looked back slightly and looked at Gu si. “Call the police.”

“Gu Si was stunned for a moment. Then, she quickly took out her phone and called the police. “Yes, Miss Ye!” ”

The police arrived very quickly and brought the three of them to the police station.

“Jamila’s nationality was in country C, and Gu Si was from the research base in China. Jamila couldn’t poach her, so she attacked Gu si. This was a very serious international problem. Facing Jamila, it would be a prison sentence. ”
