“Hearing the voices outside, the old lady came back to her senses and asked, “Who is it?” ”

“”I don’t know either,”Auntie Wu continued, “He said he’s from C Nation.” ”

C Nation!

Could it be related to Feng Qi?

Yes.

It must be about Feng Qi.

“Thinking of this, the old lady immediately walked over to open the door. “Where is he? where is he?” ”

“”He’s downstairs,”Auntie Wu said. ”

“I’ll go down right now.”The old lady immediately walked downstairs.

Auntie Wu followed her footsteps.

“The two of them walked downstairs and saw a tall, blond, and blue-eyed foreigner standing in the living room. ”

“Seeing the old lady, he immediately came up to her. “Hello, Old Lady! I’m Jamila, Professor Feng’s friend and colleague.” ”

It seemed that her guess was right.

This C nation man had come because of Feng Qi’s matter.

“The old lady’s expression did not change. She looked outside, but she did not see Feng Qi’s voice. She continued, “Where’s Feng Qi? where is she? Didn’t she come back with you?” ”

“Although Feng Qi had already betrayed her, as her mother, the old lady still had a glimmer of hope for Feng Qi. ”

She hoped that Feng Qi would turn back in time and come to his senses and realize his mistake.

“Looking at the silver-haired old lady in front of her, Camilla felt a little sympathetic. She hesitated for a moment and then said, “Can I have a private chat with you?” ”

“Sure.”The old lady nodded. “Come with me.”

The old lady led her people to the living room.

Auntie Wu brought tea with her sharp eyes.

“”Thank you,”Gamira thanked her politely. ”

“After drinking a mouthful of water, the old lady looked at Gamira and asked, “What’s wrong with Feng Qi?” ”

“When gamira came, she had investigated the old lady’s age and physical condition. Then, she said, “No matter where you are, scientific research experiments are always risky. You should be mentally prepared.” ”

Mentally prepared?

“Hearing this, the old lady’s heart skipped a beat. ”

She knew that something must have happened to Feng Qi.

“After a moment, the old lady turned to look at Jamila. “Please tell me. No matter what the consequences are, I can bear them.” ”

“She lost her husband at a young age, was abandoned by her only daughter at an old age, and lived by looking at the nanny’s eyes. In this world, what hardships had she not experienced? ”

“Feng Qi was the only daughter of the old lady. Although the old lady said it simply, Jamila was still afraid that the old lady would not be able to take it. ”

“”Old lady, actually sometimes...” ”

“The old lady laughed out loud at this time. “Say it. Just say it. There’s no need to beat around the bush. I’m already so old, what big waves have I not seen before?” ”

“”Alright!”Gamila considered the words in her heart and continued, “Old lady, Professor Feng, she was attacked and sacrificed by the XENOGENEIC when she landed on the alien planet Europa!” ”

Sacrificed...

Sacrificed.

Feng Qi was actually sacrificed.

“Although the old lady had long known that traitors would not end well, she did not expect... ... Feng Qi to sacrifice so quickly. ”

“At this moment, the old lady could not put on any expression. ”

Sad? Lonely? Sad...

All of these could not be seen.

“Someone once said that when a person was extremely sad, they could not even cry. ”

Her tears had long run out when she was young.

“Seeing this, gamira immediately said, “Old lady, Professor Feng sacrificed for humanity, for the Great Scientific Research Experiment! There is a saying in your country, ‘death is inevitable’. It is heavier than Mount Tai, or lighter than a feather, and it is used for different purposes! “Professor Feng’s sacrifice is heavier than Mount Tai! “You should be proud of her!” ” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Proud of her?

What a proud of her.

“Hearing this, the old lady’s eyes were full of sarcasm. She suddenly thought of a poem: ‘when you are alive, you will be a hero; when you are dead, you will be a hero. Until now, I, Xiang Yu, refused to cross Jiangdong.’. ”

“When Feng Qi was still very young, she had used this poem to educate Feng Qi. ”

Unfortunately.

Feng Qi had never listened to it.

“After a moment, the old lady raised her head and looked at Jamila. “If she had sacrificed herself for China’s scientific research, I would have been proud of her! But now! Who Did she sacrifice herself for? And where did she die?” ”

“Feng Qi had betrayed China, betrayed the CEN family base, and now, she had died in a foreign country! ”

“Even the old lady felt ashamed. She had never done anything wrong in her life, but she had made a mistake in educating her daughter! ”

The old lady even felt that her whole life was a joke.

“Although the old lady’s words were very straightforward, Jamila was not angry. Her face was full of pain, “Old Lady, you are exaggerating. Scientific research does not differentiate between national boundaries! No matter where Professor Feng died, she is your daughter. She is your honor! She is also the honor of the people of China!” ”
