“In the eyes of Bai Jiasheng, Bai Jingshu was a cornered beast. Even if she refused to admit it, it was only for the sake of temporary happiness. ”

“After Bai Jingshu married into the Chen family, she was already a person above everyone else. It would not be beneficial for them if Zhou Ying fell out with her at such a time. ”

“”Jingshu,”Bai Jiasheng carefully chose his words in his heart, he said earnestly, “You are the eldest daughter of the Bai family, and also the daughter that Father Dotes on the most. “There is no parent in the world who doesn’t love their children. You only saw that your mother and I wanted you to marry into the Chen family, but have you ever thought about why?” ”

“Bai Jingshu sneered. “Because you are blinded by your own interests!”For the sake of power, they were willing to sacrifice their own daughter. ” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“In fact, she should have understood long ago. ”

“In her parents’hearts, she was just a chess piece. ”

“Unfortunately, she had a bad memory. She would always forget the pain after the scar was healed. ”

“Hearing this, Bai Jiacheng sighed, then he said, “Jingshu, how can you think about your mother and me? The reason why we want you to marry Chen Yaosheng is for your own good. If something like this happened to a girl like you, your reputation would definitely be damaged! “Even if nothing happened between you and Chen Yaosheng, it won’t sound good if it gets out! “You’re a single girl. How are you going to get married in the future? “Since Chen Yaosheng was the one who did this, we have to let him take responsibility!” ”

Bai Jingzhu’s eyes turned red.

What a ridiculous reason.

Did they think that she was only three years old?

“Bai Jingfei stood up in anger. “Bai Jingzhu, you can be proud of yourself! Just wait and see. One day, I’ll marry better than you! Isn’t it just the Chen Family? What’s so great about it? !” ”

“After saying that, Bai Jingfei left the restaurant. ”

“In Bai Jingfei’s opinion, Bai Jingshu’s actions were deliberately fake. ”

“She had obviously designed Chen Yaosheng herself, and now she had to pretend to be a pitiful white lotus. ”

It was simply disgusting.

“Bai Jingshu couldn’t be bothered with Bai jingfei and continued, “I’ve said what I wanted to say. Stop Daydreaming. I Won’t cancel the case, and I won’t marry either!” ”

“After saying that, Bai Jingshu turned around and left. ”

Bai Jiasheng was really angry when he saw Bai Jingshu’s figure. He shouted angrily.

“Stop right there!”

She was an ungrateful wretch.

Bai Jingshu didn’t stop and walked straight towards the door.

Bai Jiasheng was so angry that he was trembling when he saw that Bai Jingshu dared to ignore his words. He turned to look at the servants beside him. “Lock her up!”

“Soon, seven to eight servants appeared and surrounded Bai Jingshu. ”

“Bai Jingshu was a typical lady from a wealthy family. She did not know how to wield a knife or a spear. Soon, she was brought into the room by the servants. ”

“Bai jiasheng continued, “No one is allowed to give her food these days! I want to see how hard her bones are!” ”

“Zhou Ying immediately stood up and placed her hands on Bai Jiasheng’s back. “Don’t be angry, don’t be angry. Don’t worry. She Won’t be able to hold on for more than a few days.” ”

“”What if big sister doesn’t agree?”Bai Liwen continued, “Then won’t our family have no star energy?” ”

“”She will definitely agree!”Zhou Ying patted Bai Liwen’s head. “Don’t worry, Mom will definitely not let her ruin your brothers’future.” ”

Bai Liwen and Bai Liwu were a bunch of twin brothers. They were 15 years old this year.

“Zhou Ying had already made a plan. When the Chen family sent star energy over, she would give each of them a box. ”

“Bai Liwu said worriedly, “What if big sister dies from hunger?” ”

“Zhou Ying laughed out loud. “Silly child, do you know how painful it is to starve? If she really can’t stand it anymore, she will naturally give in.” ”

“Okay.”Bai Liwu nodded.

“”Mom, three boxes of star energy. Do you and dad have to share one box with me?”Bai Jingfei walked out of nowhere and suddenly asked. ”

“”If you don’t have it, don’t even think about it.”Zhou Ying rejected her directly. ”

“Bai Jingshu said in disbelief, “Why? Both of them have it. Why Don’t I Have It?” ”

This was too unfair!

“”Just because they are brothers and you are the elder sister!”Zhou ying frowned and said, “As the elder sister, it’s fine if you don’t know how to give way to your younger brother, but now you want to snatch things from your younger brother! Do you have an elder sister like you?” ”

“In Zhou Ying’s opinion, when a girl grew up, she had to get married. After she got married, she would no longer be considered part of the family. ”

Star energy was such a precious thing. How could it be given to an outsider?

Of course not!

“”Isn’t there a total of three boxes? Each of them has one box. Can’t they give me one box?”Who wouldn’t want something good? Bai Jingfei also wanted to use these things to increase her self-worth. She wanted to find an outstanding son of the rich and powerful. Just like Bai Jingshu, she wanted to become the second madam of the Chen family that everyone respected. ”
