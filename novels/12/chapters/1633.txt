Translator: 549690339

Landing on Neptune?

Implementing the freedom of diamonds for all?

Oh My God!

What kind of daydream was Yesen having.

It was simply ridiculous.

“”What are you laughing at?”Yesen continued, “Old Xu, I’m not joking with you! I’m very serious! If you don’t get rid of those diamonds, you’ll definitely regret it! “Once everyone is free with diamonds, the price of the diamonds will definitely be lowered! “You have so many diamonds in your inventory, don’t lose so much that you can’t even afford to wear pants!””

“”In the future, diamonds will no longer be a luxury item, but a decorative item. When that time comes, the price of diamonds will definitely suffer a Waterloo!”

“”At present, all the diamonds in China are imported from abroad. Once China realizes the freedom of diamonds for all, those diamond mountains abroad will also suffer a devastating blow!”

There were still more than five hours before ye Zao’s return. Old Xu could still get rid of those diamonds in time!

“Old Xu did not take this matter to heart and continued to ask, “President Ye, I heard that Dr. YC is your niece?””

“”Yes. That’s right,”ye Sen said.”

“Old Xu smiled and said, “President Ye, I can understand your feelings of protecting your niece. If I were in your shoes, if my niece was Dr. YC, I would definitely believe her! Unfortunately, I’m not.”He was just an outsider, therefore, he would not make any sacrifices for ye Zhuo, and he would not sell the diamonds in his inventory.”

“Old Xu had sold the diamonds too early last year and had lost tens of millions of dollars. Today, he had double the amount of diamonds from last year. He was waiting for the price of the diamonds to rise so that he could make a huge profit from it.”

Xu had done some research when he was stockpiling diamonds. The market this year would definitely not be worse than last year!

“Hearing Xu’s words, Ye Sen was very anxious. After all, he was Xu’s best friend, “Xu, trust me. Quickly sell all your diamonds! Otherwise, after a few hours, you won’t have such an opportunity!””

“”In short, I Won’t lie to You!””

“Old Xu smiled and said, “President Ye, I Know You Won’t lie to me. You just trust your big niece too much!””

“Old Xu!”Ye Sen was extremely anxious.

“Old Xu continued, “Alright, Alright. I still have something to do. I Won’t talk to you anymore. Let’s have tea together another day.””

“”It’s not Old Xu,”ye sen continued, “I’m very serious! Don’t not listen to me...””

“”I understand how you feel. Alright, I’m hanging up now.””

“Before ye Sen could finish his sentence, Old Xu hung up the phone.”

“Seeing Old Xu hang up the phone, Pan Tao, his good friend next to him, asked with a smile, “Who called?””

“”The CEO of Shengdong Express,”old XU said.”

“Ye Sen?”Pan Tao continued to ask.

“”Yes.”Old Xu nodded. “Speaking of this CEO Ye, he’s a good person, but it’s a pity that his fate isn’t too good. He met a prodigal niece, and this time, he’s going to suffer!””

“What do you mean?”Pan Tao asked curiously.

“Old Xu continued to explain the purpose of Ye Sen’s call. “Do you think this Ye Sen is muddle-headed? He actually asked me to sell all the diamonds in my inventory! He even said that in the future, diamonds will no longer be luxury goods, but decorative items!””

“Hearing this, Pan Tao said with some surprise, “You’re saying that Dr. YC is Ye Sen’s eldest niece?”” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Yes.”Old Xu nodded.

“Pan Tao said, “Oh my God! I didn’t expect Ye Sen and Dr. YC to be related!””

“Old Xu continued, “Actually, when I first found out about this, I was also quite surprised!””

Old Xu originally thought that ye Zao would make a great achievement.

“After all, Ye Zao was indeed powerful before, and he was even praised as the dark horse of the scientific and technological world.”

Who knew that ye Zao would come up with an aircraft carrier plan in the end!

“At this time, Old Xu knew that Ye Sen’s niece was finished.”

Self-destruction of her future!

“Although he was not in the scientific and technological world, and did not know much about things in the scientific and technological world, he knew that it was not so easy for humans to surpass the speed of light.”

“Pan Tao continued, “Then do you want to sell those diamonds in your hands?””

“Old Xu said speechlessly, “Am I crazy? I sell diamonds? Do you really think that Ye Sen’s niece can land on Neptune? Do you know how far Neptune is from Earth? 4.5 billion kilometers! And she can land on Neptune in four hours. I think she might not be able to land on Neptune even after 40 years!””

“”That’s true.”Pan Tao nodded. “If YC can really land on Neptune, won’t those foreign diamond merchants cry to death?””
