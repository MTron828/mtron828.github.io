[ this unlucky guy is really persistent. ]

“[ actually, I quite like watching the unlucky guy and Ye Zi play chess. This should be the only person who can really fight with the streamer. ] ”

[ I also feel that the streamer has a connection with this person. ]

[ I have to kowtow to this couple! ]

“On the other end of the screen, Cen Shaoqing was playing chess. From time to time, he would look down at the phone in front of the computer desk. ”

On the screen of the phone was ye Zhuo’s live broadcast.

“Because the bullet screen blocked his view too much, he turned off the bullet screen. ”

“Therefore, he did not know that he already had a new nickname. He also did not know that someone had already played the match between him and Ye Zhuo. ”

15 minutes later.

The game ended.

There was no doubt.

He lost.

“Cen Shaoqing narrowed his eyes. After playing chess with this person for so long, he still had not figured out her chess style. ”

Even if there was only one pawn left in the end.

She could still turn defeat into victory.

“Every time she played chess with her, it would bring a brand new feeling to people. ”

Cen Shaoqing picked up his phone and sent a gift out.

“A fairy wearing a rainbow feather coat stepped on a rainbow auspicious cloud and slowly flew past the screen. Moreover, because of the high price, this gift was promoted on the entire platform. ”

“As long as it was a live stream at this time, anyone could see this gift no matter which room they were in. ”

“The price was 50,000 yuan each. ”

“As soon as this gift was sent out, the bullet screen exploded. “F * ck! F * ck! Big Boss! I worship Big Boss!” ”

“This is really rich!”

“”Big Boss, please keep her!” ”

“1 million?”

“Are you stupid? That’s 2.5 million!”

“Before the bullet comments could finish, another wave of gifts came. ”

[ this is a real boss! ]

[ I came from the next room to watch the boss. ]

[ plus one! I also came from the next room! ]

“[ I came to watch 5,000,000. ] ”

“[ what a coincidence, Me Too! ] ”

“The number of people in the live broadcast room instantly went from 120,000 to 130,000,140,000, and finally 150,000. ”

“Because he could not see the bullet screen, Cen Shaoqing did not know that because the two gifts that he casually gave shocked everyone on the platform. Even his account had gained a wave of fans. ” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

There were even many female live streamers who sent him private messages.

They all wanted to get close to this rich person.

“Just as he had given out this wave of gifts, Cen Shaoqing’s phone rang. ”

“Hello.”

“Master Five.”The Secretary’s voice came from the other end of the screen.

“Speak.”Cen Shaoqing leaned slightly against the back of his chair and slowly stroked the Buddha beads.

“The secretary continued, “Master Five, the person you asked me to check has been found. The information has been sent to your email.” ”

“Okay.”

After hanging up the phone.

Cen Shaoqing logged into his email using his computer and opened the attachment sent by his secretary.

Song Shiyu.

Male.

Unmarried.

28 years old.

The eldest son of the song family.

The head of the song group...

Song Shiyu?

What kind of person was this?

How did ye Zhuo Know Him?

“Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly. His heart seemed to be covered by a layer of dark clouds, and he couldn’t breathe. ”

He felt extremely uncomfortable.

On the other side.

“When ye Zhuo received these two waves of gifts worth five million yuan, he was also stunned. ”

“After broadcasting for such a long time, she met the richest fan, who gave her five hundred thousand Yuan in one go. ”

These five million yuan...

This was the first time he had seen it.

“Moreover, this person seemed to be a new account, and he did not even change his account name. ”

“However, Ye Zhuo did not think too much about it. After the money was received, she donated the money anonymously in batches to poor areas and orphanages. ”

“Ever since ye Zao started broadcasting, she did not keep any of the money from the broadcast and donated it all ”

The next day.

Ye Zao went to Lin Shasha’s house to tutor her.

“After a long period of hard work, Lin Shasha’s grades had gradually stabilized. If the situation continued to develop like this, she should have no problem getting into a university next year. ”

Time passed quickly.

“In the blink of an eye, it was time for the college entrance examination results to be released. ”

“She, an Lizi, and Zhao Pingting were having a video chat to check their scores together. ”

“”D * MN! My Luck has exploded! I actually got 658 points! Looks like there won’t be any problems in filling in for the Beijing Normal University! Zhuozhuo, Lizi, have you guys found it?” ”

“An Lizi said excitedly, “We found it! We found it! I got 718 points!” ”

“”Congratulations, Lizi!” ”

“What About You?”

Ye Zhuo frowned slightly. “I don’t think my score is out yet.”

“”You can’t find it?”Zhao pingting asked curiously, “Could it be that the system is delayed?” ”
