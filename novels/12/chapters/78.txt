Chapter 79: 072: Face-smacking! In the burning business empire, Lin Sha recognized the scumbag and had an abortion

Zhao Yang raised his head, his eyes shining with surprise. He didn’t expect such a beauty to be hiding in a small place like Yunjing.

“I am.”Zhao yang nodded politely and asked, “May I know who you are?”

Ye Zao smiled and reached out his hand to Zhao Yang. “Hello, I am Z, the person in charge of ZY Technology Co. , Ltd. . My surname is Ye.”

“You... You’re Miss Z?”Zhao Yang asked in surprise.

It was obvious that he did not expect ye Zao to be so young.

Was she 18 years old?

When Zhao Yang was negotiating with ye Zao Online, he thought that ye Zao was at least a middle-aged man in his 30s or 40s.

That was because her conversation was not something a teenage girl could have.

Ye Zao nodded slightly and leaned over to sit opposite Zhao Yang.

“This is the contract. If you don’t have any problems, you can just sign it.”

Zhao Yang pushed up his glasses. “Excuse me, can I take a look at the product first?”

Although the proposal ye Zao gave was very impressive.

But before seeing the product, Zhao Yang could not trust ye Zao.

There were too many people talking on paper, and Ye Zao was still so young.

Could she really invent clothes that could adjust the temperature?

It seemed like a fantasy.

Zhao Yang did not want to be a hero who was full of business talent but useless.

Ye Zhuo handed Zhao Yang a bag. “Mr. Zhao, you can try washing your phone.”

Zhao Yang took the bag and went to the bathroom with a dubious expression.

He took out the clothes from the bag and frowned slightly.

This was because the clothes were too ordinary.

There was no substantial difference from the white shirt he was wearing.

He knew it. How could a young girl in her teens have such a heaven-defying invention?

Zhao Yang’s eyes were full of disappointment. He came to the front hall and said bluntly, “Miss Ye, this clothes doesn’t seem to be any different from ordinary clothes.”

Ye Zhuo smiled slightly. “Clothes that can adjust the temperature are all adjusted according to the temperature of the air. The air conditioner is turned on here. You can try it outside.”

Zhao Yang went outside.

The weather in December in Yunjing was already slightly cold.

The surrounding passers-by were all wrapped in cotton clothes.

A gust of cold wind blew over. Not only did Zhao Yang not feel the expected cold, but his entire body was wrapped by a warm current. It was exceptionally comfortable.

So this was really a suit that could adjust the temperature!

Zhao Yang’s eyes lit up and he immediately ran into the cafe. “Miss Ye, it’s really amazing! This suit is really amazing!”

Ye Zhuo smiled slightly. “Mr. Zhao, can you sign the contract now?”

“I’ll Sign It! I’ll Sign It!”Zhao Yang suppressed his excitement and signed the contract.

Clothes that could adjust the temperature were not even invented by country P, which was the most technologically advanced country. Once this technology was introduced, it would become popular all over the world!

At that time, even his status as a professional CEO would rise with the tide!

At this moment, Ye Zhuo was not only an employee to Zhao Yang, but also his uncle!

“Happy working with you.”Ye Zhuo took out a set of keys. “These are the company keys, the car keys, and the warehouse keys. You’ve just returned to Yun Jing. You can adjust your status first before going to the company. If you have any problems, you can call me.”

Zhao Yang bowed respectfully to ye Zhuo. “Thank you for Your Trust in me, Miss Ye.”

Unknowingly, Zhao Yang had already used the honorific title.

Although ye Zhuo was young, he was definitely worthy of his respect.

...

There was only one week left until Miao Yin’s third anniversary celebration. Li Qiandong was preparing to return to the capital soon. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Fifth brother, do you want to return to the capital with me to attend Miao Yin’s third anniversary party?”

“I’m not interested.”Cen Shaoqing closed his eyes and twirled the Buddhist beads.

He was not interested again.

Li Qiandong had originally wanted to use this evening party as an opportunity to properly matchmake Cen Shaoqing and Mu Yourong.

He did not expect Cen Shaoqing to directly reject him.

Li Qiandong narrowed his eyes and continued, “Sitara YC will also participate in this evening party. Fifth brother, are you really not going? Fifth Brother, don’t you want to see what the person who has won several rounds against you looks like?”

Hearing this, Cen Shaoqing suddenly opened his eyes and the Buddha beads circled around his fingertips. “Are you sure?”

“Yes, I’m sure!”Li Qiandong nodded his head with certainty. “Sitara YC is Our Amazing Sound’s live streamer. This time, she will be participating in the third anniversary gala.”

“When do we leave for the capital city?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

Did he agree?

Seeing how Cen Shaoqing valued Sitara so much, Li Qiandong sighed in his heart.

How much Cen Shaoqing wished to see Sitara now, how disappointed he would be when he arrived at the venue of the Gala!

After all, Sitara was just a cheating live streamer!

At that time, Li Qiandong was still puzzled that there was actually someone in this world who could win against Cen Shaoqing.

He didn’t expect that the other party was cheating.

However, there were pros and cons to this matter. The most important thing was that Cen Shaoqing could see a different Mu Yourong at the venue of the gala!

A Mu Yourong who had superb chess skills and outshone the rest!

Not only was Sitara YC ugly, he also cheated. Even if he really came to the venue of the gala, he would only be a foil to Mu Yourong at that time..
