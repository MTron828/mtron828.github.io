Translator: 549690339

“Bai Sanfeng was really angry. After all, she had watched Bai Jingshu grow up. ”

She had always felt that Bai Jingshu’s future was limitless. Bai Jingshu could marry a supreme person.

But Now?

Bai Jingshu had only married a low-level earthling!

What was an Earthling?

“”Grandma, who are you angry with?”Ma Yue walked out and asked curiously when she saw Bai Sanfeng like this. ”

“Do you know that your cousin is getting married?”Bai Sanfeng turned to look at her granddaughter.

“Although Ma Yue had several cousins, Bai Sanfeng only cared about Bai Jingshu. ”

“Firstly, it was because Bai Jingshu looked the most like Bai sanfeng, and secondly, it was because Bai Jingshu was the most obedient and sensible among her sisters. ”

“Although she was not outstanding, she never did anything out of the ordinary. ”

“Moreover, as a girl, she had to get married eventually, so it was fine as long as she was responsible for being pretty. In the future, if she married into a good family, she would still be able to shine in the family. ”

“Therefore, Bai Sanfeng had always looked highly upon Bai Jingshu, and she had always vowed in her heart that she would not let Bai Jingshu follow in her footsteps. ”

“She did not expect that Bai Jingshu, who had no heart, would end up like her in the end. ”

“Hearing this, Ma Yue was stunned and said in surprise, “Cousin is getting married? To whom? The Sun family or the Wang Family? I heard that the second young master of the Wang family had a crush on cousin, but I didn’t expect that they would really succeed!” ”

“What second young master of the Wang Family!”Bai Sanfeng snorted. “You think too highly of her.”

“Who is that?”Ma Yue was a little surprised.

“According to Bai Jingshu’s market, she would only marry better than the Wang family. However, from Bai Sanfeng’s appearance, why did it feel like Bai Jingshu didn’t marry into a good family? ”

Bai Sanfeng looked at Ma Yue. “You really don’t Know?”

Ma Yue shook her head. “You also know about my cousin. She only wants to study Earth’s culture. I don’t have anything in common with her. The last time we talked was a year ago.”

Bai Jingshu was indeed a freak.

Earth’s culture had always been a mess.

But she had always been absorbing the mess.

“At this point, Ma Yue seemed to have thought of something. She widened her eyes and said in disbelief, “My cousin didn’t find an Earthling, did she?” ”

“Bai Jingshu had always been very fond of Earth’s culture. She was infatuated with it, so it was not surprising that such a situation had really happened. ”

“That’s right. She just found a low-level earthling!”Bai Sanfeng said.

Bai Sanfeng was very regretful now.

“She used to think that life was so short. As long as a girl lived a happy life, her interests and hobbies could develop freely. ”

“Now it seemed that she could not let it develop at all. As long as she realized that something was wrong, she had to stop it immediately. ”

“For example, Bai Jingshu. ”

“If she had stopped Bai Jingshu from studying Earth’s culture in time, Bai Jingshu would not have ended up like this. ”

“Although she was mentally prepared, when she heard Bai Sanfeng say this, Ma Yue was still very shocked. “Really? My cousin really found an Earthling?” ”

“Although Bai Jingshu did not have much brain, she would not go so far as to find an earthling. ”

“Compared to the s galaxy, what was an Earthling? ”

What was the difference between what Bai Jingshu did and what she was willing to do?

“People go higher, but water flows lower. Was Bai Jingshu crazy? ”

“We’re about to get married. Do you think it’s true or not?”Bai Sanfeng said.

“Ma Yue clicked her tongue and continued, “Then can my cousin and the others agree?” ”

“”They’ve already severed their ties,”Bai Sanfeng replied. ”

“Normally, Bai Sanfeng wouldn’t have taken a fancy to her eldest nephew and his wife, but she felt that they were doing the right thing in this matter. ”

“Bai Jingshu’s decision was wrong in the first place. No matter what, she shouldn’t marry an earthling. ”

“If it were her, she would also sever her ties with Bai Jingshu. ”

“”Then what did my great-uncle say?”Ma Yue continued, “Doesn’t my cousin listen to her great-uncle the most?” ”

Bai Sanfeng sighed. “Your great-uncle is already old and muddled!” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Old and muddled?

“When Ma Yue heard this, she felt that something was amiss. She continued, “Could it be that my great-uncle has agreed to my cousin being together with that Earthling?” ”

“”If it wasn’t for your uncle-grandfather, things wouldn’t have turned out this way!”This was all because of Bai Sifeng’s indulgence. ”

Ma Yue frowned slightly. “Uncle-grandfather doesn’t look like such an unreasonable person! Could it be that he’s really old?”

Bai Sanfeng sighed again.

“Ma Yue continued, “Grandmother, don’t be anxious. has this matter really reached the point of no return?” ”
