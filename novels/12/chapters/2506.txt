“Xiao Guo smiled and said, “Sister, don’t worry. I’ve been traveling with Granny since I was young. I’m very familiar with this place. I’ll be fine!” ”

“Looking at Xiao Guo’s back, Ye Zhuo turned to look at CEN Shaoqing and said with a sigh, “It’s so good to be young!” ”

“CEN Shaoqing said, “You’re very young too.” ”

Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly. “That’s a must! You’re eighteen years old. Do you understand?”

“At this moment, ye Zao suddenly saw a fish that had run aground. “Fish! Quick, quick, Quick!” ”

Cen Shaoqing followed her line of sight and indeed saw a fish.

“It weighed about two to three Jin, and the color of the fish scales was very bright. ”

Cen Shaoqing immediately put down the things in his hands and went to catch the fish.

“This was not his first time catching fish, so his movements looked very consistent. Ye Zao took out his phone and took a lot of photos, then sent them to the group. ”

This was the CEN family group.

Old Mrs. Cen was the first to speak: [ who is this? Why does he look so much like my stupid grandson? ]

Cen Yuying: [ Shaoqing? ! ! ]

Zhou Xiang: [ don’t be surprised. ]

“As long as he was with Ye Zhuo, no matter what Cen Shaoqing did, Zhou Xiang would not find it strange. ”

“After all, that person was ye Zhuo. ”

And then there was the crazy mugwort ye Zhuo.

[ Zao Zao is amazing! ]

“[ as expected, it’s a little tofu with brine. ] ”

[ ... ]

“Ye Zao did not have time to reply to the messages in the group because she actually saw a big bread crab on the stranded beach. She immediately put down her phone, walked to the side, and started to catch bread crabs. ”

“In less than two hours, the two of them had a full harvest. ”

...

The next day.

Ye Zao woke up very early because CEN Shaoqing had said that they were going to the Nameless Island today.

“Opening the wardrobe, ye Zao picked out a white one-piece dress. ”

“Her skin was cold and white, so it was very suitable for a white one-piece dress. She looked like she was out of this world. ”

“Leader.”

She had just changed her clothes when there was a knock on the door.

“What’s Wrong?”Ye Zao asked.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Are you ready?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo opened the door.

“Cen Shaoqing twirled the prayer beads. “Let’s go downstairs for dinner. After dinner, we’ll set off.” ”

“Okay.”

“At the dining table, Yu Niannian asked curiously, “Zixu, where are you guys going later?” ”

“”A single dog doesn’t deserve to know,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

Yu Niannian choked.

“Although he was a single dog, he did not lack female companions! ”

“I saw a helicopter parked outside the door. Do you guys want to take the helicopter later?”Yu Munian continued to ask.

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Yu Munian sighed softly. “I originally wanted to borrow a helicopter from you guys.”

“Nowadays, using a luxury car to flirt with girls was already outdated. ”

It was cool to use a plane!

Yu Shaoqing did not have a private plane.

“It was not because he could not afford it. Besides, the procedures to buy a plane were too complicated. ”

“Therefore, he used the Cen family’s plane most of the time. ”

“After dinner, Ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing boarded the plane. ”

It would take half an hour to get to the Nameless Island.

“Just as they were about to arrive, CEN Shaoqing took out a ribbon and looked at Ye Zhuo. “Leader, close your eyes. I have a surprise for you later.” ”

“What Surprise?”Ye Zao asked.

“”Close your eyes,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

Ye Zao closed his eyes.

“Her eyelashes were dense and long. When she closed them, they cast a fan-shaped shadow under her eyelids. ”

Cen Shaoqing held the white ribbon and covered ye Zao’s eyes. He tied a bow on the back of his head.

“Ye Zao teased, “You’re not thinking of selling me, are you?” ”

“”Yes,”Cen Shaoqing answered. “Is it okay to sell me to the foolish son of the landlord?” ”

Ye Zao laughed softly.

“As the helicopter slowed down and the noise grew louder, the helicopter finally came to a steady stop. ”

“Cen Shaoqing held ye Zao’s hand and walked out. “Zao Zao, you can open your eyes now.” ”
