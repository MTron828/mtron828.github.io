“He didn’t expect Liu Neng to make a trip to the 58th floor. Not only was he safe and sound, he even got promoted. ”

Liu Neng nodded. “Yes.”

“What position?”Allie asked.

Liu Neng remained mysterious. “You’ll know in a while!”

“When he heard that, director Zhou looked at Liu Neng with a complicated expression. ”

Liu Neng excitedly opened the promotion letter.

“When he saw it, he was completely dumbfounded. ”

Could it be that he was seeing things?

“Liu Neng rubbed his eyes, widened his eyes, and looked again. ” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

But the scene in front of him didn’t change.

“”T-director Zhou! There must be a mistake, right?”Liu Neng raised his head to look at director Zhou. ”

It was clearly a promotion letter.

How did it become a resignation letter?

There must be a mistake!

There must be a mistake!

“Chief Zhou said, “There’s no mistake. It’s a resignation letter. Liu Neng, you’ve already been fired by President Ye! Pack up and leave quickly!” ”

“When she heard the resignation letter, the smile on Ally’s face instantly disappeared, and her eyes were filled with disbelief. ”

Fired?

Liu Neng had actually been fired by Ye Zhuo!

What happened on the 58th floor just now?

“From the way Liu Neng went downstairs, it didn’t seem like anything had happened. ”

“Liu Neng lost control of his emotions and said, “I didn’t do anything wrong, nor did I violate the rules of the consortium. What right does ye Zhuo have to fire me?” ”

“Director Zhou glanced at Liu Neng and said in a cold tone, “Go to the official website for the specific reason.” ”

Ali immediately turned on the computer next to her.

She saw that a new notice had just been posted on the internal website of the Shunxi Financial Group.

The notice detailed the details of Liu Neng’s dismissal.

“Moreover, not only was Liu Neng fired, but he was also given a big demerit. After deducting his year-end bonus, he was fined 200,000 yuan and held legally responsible. ”

The demerit of dismissal was not a small matter.

These experiences would be recorded in his resume.

“In the future, it would be difficult for him to look for listed consortia again. ”

This was worse than killing Liu Neng.

“In addition, the official website also listed Liu Neng’s plan a with three loopholes. ”

As a warning to others!

“Seeing this scene, Liu Neng’s face instantly turned pale and his blood flowed backwards. ”

Never in his wildest dreams did he expect that ye Zao really understood the plan.

“Not only did ye Zao understand it, but his methods were also so fast, ruthless, and accurate! ”

“From the time he went downstairs until now, it had not even been ten minutes. ”

The notice was already posted on the official website.

“This meant that when ye Zao asked him to go upstairs, he had already been preparing for all of this. ”

She looked indifferent.

“In reality, killing was invisible! ”

“Liu Neng, who was feeling smug just a second ago, was now like a deflated rubber ball, lying limply on the ground with a defeated look on his face. ”

What should he do?

What should he do now?

“At this moment, Liu Neng suddenly hugged director Zhou’s leg. “Director! Please save me! I Can’t leave the consortium! I Can’t be fired!” ”

“Director Zhou shook his head. “If you knew this would happen, why did you do it in the first place?” ”

“Liu Neng continued, “Please help me plead with Miss Ye! I beg you!” ”

“It’s no use.”Director Zhou shook Liu Neng off.

“Liu Neng fell to the ground, feeling extremely uncomfortable. There was no light in his eyes. ”

“At this moment, Liu Neng seemed to have suddenly thought of something. ”

That’s right.

There was also Zhao Xueyin.

Zhao Xueyin had asked him to do this.

Zhao Xueyin had to protect him.

“Thinking of this, Liu Neng heaved a sigh of relief. He forced himself to get up from the ground and went to his office desk to pack his things. ”

“Half an hour later, Liu Neng walked out of the Shunxi Financial Group with his things. ”

“After learning about Liu Neng’s matter, the Financial Group’s internal department was also in a heated discussion. Everyone was worried about their safety and was afraid that trouble would arise. ”

Ye Zhuo had only been in office for one day.

He had already fired two people.

“If it were anyone else, would they have such means? ”

“It looks like the Ye family is still the Ye family! This president ye is really too amazing!”

“A new official takes on a new post. Let’s Keep a low profile for the time being.”

“President ye even dared to fire Sun Yiran. What Can Liu Be?”

“You Say President Ye and Miss Zhao. Who is more amazing compared to these two people?”Someone in the cubicle asked.

“There was a moment of silence in the air, “I think President Ye is more powerful. You Didn’t see it yesterday! Miss Zhao couldn’t even see her shadow in front of Miss Ye! Moreover, President Ye is the largest shareholder of our consortium! Whether it’s status, position, or ability, president ye is slightly better!” ”

“”At least Miss Zhao relied on her own hard work to have her status today. If President Ye isn’t a descendant of the Ye family, who would know her?” ”
