“Mu yourong said, “I’ll arrange this matter. Dad, you should use this money to resolve the current crisis first. You must not mess up the People’s Hearts!” ”

Mu Yourong’s bank card had more than 20 million.

“Although 20 million was not a lot, it could solve the urgent problem. ”

“In any case, the next matter would be solved by ZY. ”

“Soldier Mu nodded. “Okay, I’ll go to the company now.” ”

Cen Shaoqing was sitting at his desk reading documents.

“At this moment, there was a knock on the door. ”

“”Come in,”Cen Shaoqing said without raising his head. ”

The secretary came in from outside. “Master Five.”

“”Speak,”Cen Shaoqing said concisely. ”

“The secretary stood respectfully in front of the desk and continued, “Fifth master, I’ve already found the two people you asked me to find.” ”

Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly when he heard this. He closed the documents and looked up at the secretary. “Who are those two people?”

“The secretary continued, “They’re song Shiyu’s men.” ”

“Song Shiyu?”Cen Shaoqing narrowed his eyes.

The scene of Song Shiyu sending ye Zhuo off at the cocktail party replayed in his mind.

The two of them standing together.

It was really eye-piercing!

“What’s song Shiyu’s motive?”

“The secretary continued, “They were sent by song Shiyu to be in charge of Miss Ye’s safety.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing clenched the prayer beads in his hands. “Alright, I got it! You can leave now.” ”

The secretary bent down and walked out of the door.

In the office.

Cen Shaoqing’s tightly knitted brows never relaxed.

Song Shiyu had a particularly gloomy personality.

He was temperamental.

He had killed his own father with his own hands when he was two days away from adulthood!

What was the relationship between Ye Zhuo and Him?

Why did song Shiyu arrange for people to protect ye Zhuo?

What exactly was song Shiyu trying to do?

“After a moment, CEN Shaoqing made a call. ”

“The call was quickly picked up. “Hello, Master Five.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing turned the Buddha bead and said, “Send someone to keep an eye on song Shiyu.” ”

Keep an eye on song Shiyu?

The person on the other end of the line was stunned.

He even thought that he was hearing things.

Why was he staring at song Shiyu all of a sudden?

“The person on the other end of the phone asked uncertainly, “Master Five, is it song Shiyu from the song group?” ”

“Yes.”

Was It really him?

“The person was stunned for a moment before saying, “Alright, I’ll make the arrangements right away.” ”

“After hanging up, Cen Shaoqing continued to read the documents. ”

“A minute later, he closed the documents again and picked up the lighter and cigarette beside him. ”

Click —

A faint blue flame shot out from the lighter and lit the cigarette between his fingers.

“With the cigarette between his thin lips, the familiar smell of tobacco instantly filled his entire mouth. ”

Cen Shaoqing walked to the floor-to-ceiling mirror and looked down at the scenery below his feet. His sexy Adam’s apple moved up and down and slowly exhaled a beautiful ring of smoke.

“The man’s figure was slender and he wore a long, buttoned-up robe. He stood in front of the floor-to-ceiling window as if he was a king overlooking the world. He exuded a noble aura while he was abstinent. ”

It was beyond one’s reach.

Soon.

He finished his cigarette.

Cen Shaoqing took another cigarette.

“Unknowingly, in less than ten minutes, he had finished half a pack of cigarettes. ”

“Cen Shaoqing did not have much of a craving for cigarettes. Today, it was obvious that he had lost control. ”

“He could still puff out smoke rings from the cigarette, but the depression in his heart could not be released. ”

“Especially when he thought of Song Shiyu, he felt even worse! ”

“At this moment, his phone rang. ”

It was a message from wechat.

“Other than the people close to him and ye Zhuo, no one else knew about Cen Shaoqing’s wechat. ”

Could It Be Ye Zhuo?

Cen Shaoqing walked over and picked up his phone.

“As expected, it was a wechat message from ye Zhuo. ”

The depression in Cen Shaoqing’s heart disappeared in an instant. He swiped the lock screen and clicked on wechat.

Ye Zhuo: [ did you go to the hospital? What did the Doctor Say? ]

Was she concerned about him?

“If she had not sent him a message, he would have forgotten about this matter. ”

Cen Shaoqing’s lips curled into a faint smile as he replied: [ not yet. ]

In fact.

Ye Zhuo was really concerned about CEN Shaoqing.

It was because Cen Shaoqing’s illness was too strange.

She was curious about what strange illness Cen Shaoqing had.

What other illness could she not diagnose!

Ye Zhuo: [ remember to let me know when you’re there. ]

Cen Shaoqing: [ I’ll be there in a while. ]

Ye Zhuo: [ it’s best to do a full-body CT scan so that it can be examined more thoroughly. ]

[ Okay. ]

“After replying to Ye Zhuo’s message, Cen Shaoqing extinguished the cigarette butt in his hand and walked out of the door. ”
