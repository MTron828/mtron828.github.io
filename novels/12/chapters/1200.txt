“Chapter 1201: 257: Trash, Zhao Xueyin has been thrown out! The rightful heir of the consortium! 3”

Translator: 549690339

“Therefore, in the financial world, the Zhao family’s reputation had always been good.”

“But now, it was all ruined.”

Everything that Father Zhao had painstakingly built had become a laughing stock.

“”Master, Please Calm Down.”The Butler opened his mouth. “The most important thing now is to get someone to take down this news!””

“Father Zhao pinched his temple. “Go and make the arrangements. No matter how much it costs, we have to suppress the heat.””

“”Okay, I’ll do it right away.”Old Zhang bent down.”

Father Zhao looked at Zhao Xueyin. “What’s going on between you and master five?”

“When master five was mentioned again, Zhao Xueyin immediately cried.”

“Master Five is Cen Shaoqing...”

“”What?”Hearing this, Father Zhao’s face turned pale.”

Master Five is Cen Shaoqing?

Who is Cen Shaoqing?

Ye Zhuo’s boyfriend!

Father Zhao instantly understood why Zhao Xueyin was thrown out of DK Jewelry Center.

A trap.

“This was not only a trap, it was also a trap within a trap.”

“Father Zhao’s strength seemed to be sucked out of his body in an instant, and he fell onto the sofa like dead wood and ashes.”

Cen Shaoqing was ye Zao’s boyfriend. What else could Zhao Xueyin use to fight with ye Zao?

“After a long while, Father Zhao finally reacted, he pointed at Zhao Xueyin and said, “Think about it carefully. How many times have I warned you! Be careful of Ye Zao, be careful of Ye Zao! If you had listened to my words, you would not have ended up like this!””

Zhao Xueyin was too confident.

The old saying was right.

Overconfidence turned into conceit.

Zhao Xueyin was overconfident.

“Hearing Father Zhao’s words, Zhao Xueyin cried even more miserably.”

She didn’t understand how she was inferior to Ye Zao.

Why did those men like ye Zao so much?

“”Master.”At this moment, the Butler walked in.”

“What’s Wrong?”

The Butler’s expression didn’t look good. “The news agency isn’t willing to close down.”

“Which news agency?”

“Jin Cheng News Agency.”

Father Zhao narrowed his eyes. “I remember that Ah Lui is quite familiar with this news agency. Go and give Ah Lui a call.”

“Okay.”Old Zhang nodded.

“”There’s no need to call,”Zhao Xueyin suddenly said.”

Old Zhang was stunned.

“Zhao Xueyin continued, “I had a falling out with the lawyer.””

“What?”Father Zhao looked at Zhao Xueyin. “Say that again!”

Zhao Xueyin took a deep breath. “I said I had a falling out with the lawyer.”

“Then quickly go and coax him back!”Father Zhao continued.

“It’s useless...”Zhao Xueyin shook her head.

She and the lawyer had reached a point where there was no turning back.

“”How did you offend Ah Lui?”Father Zhao was flustered and exasperated, “Idiot! You Idiot! How many times have I told you! One more spare tire means one more way out! My Words, you just ignore them! Hurry up and coax Ah Lui back!””

The important thing was that the lawyer was easy to handle. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Not only was it easy to handle, the lawyer also had talent.”

The most important thing was that the lawyer could accept him as his wife!

“If Zhao Ziye could not be found, father Zhao would have to rely on the lawyer for the rest of his life.”

“According to the lawyer’s personality, it would not be a problem for their child to follow Zhao Xueyin’s surname in the future.”

Zhao Xueyin stood there without moving or saying anything.

Father Zhao became even angrier. “Are you deaf? I told you to coax Ah Lui back!”

“”I’m not going!”Zhao Xueyin continued, “Isn’t the lawyer just a dog in our family? Although I can’t marry Master Five, I wouldn’t go to the extent of begging a dog!””

Zhao Xueyin had already taken the initiative to add the lawyer on wechat.

It was the lawyer who did not grasp the opportunity.

There was only one chance.

Zhao Xueyin’s pride and self-esteem did not allow her to ask the lawyer for a second time.

“Besides, the lawyer was not some nobleman.”

He was just a part-time worker.

“Although she could not marry master five, the nobleman in the financial world was still chosen by her!”

She did not need to beg a dog at all.

Moreover.

Zhao Xueyin believed that the lawyer would one day regret it!

“Father Zhao was furious, he pointed at Zhao Xueyin and said, “You said that the lawyer is a dog, then how can you be nobler than him? Do you really think you’re something? If you’re really that noble, why did fifth Master Not Want You? Do you still think that you can marry into some powerful family? It’s already your good fortune that the lawyer has taken a fancy to you. I think that your heart is as high as the sky, and your life is as thin as paper!””

Zhao Xueyin was provoked by these words.

“Heart as high as the sky, and life as thin as paper!”

“If others say so, then forget it, but this person is her father.”

Biological father.

“In the impression, from childhood to adulthood, Father Zhao did not encourage her.”
