Chapter 111: 077: setting people up, burning online, birthday banquet venue 4

After saying that.., shen Rong continued, “Instead of letting that little b * Tch Ye Zhuo benefit, why don’t you let your two cousins follow you to the song family? After all, they’re family. If song Shiyu takes a fancy to them, our family can at least bask in their glory together.”

Let Ye Zhuo go?

That trash ye Zhuo, how could she be worthy of Song Shiyu?

Soldier Mu nodded in agreement. “I think what your mother said is very reasonable.”

Mu Yourong shook her head lightly, “Bask in the light? Father and mother, you think this matter is too simple. Do you think that by marrying into the song family, you will be married into a nest of riches? Let me tell you, that person, Song Shiyu, is far more terrifying than what you know! I think that you don’t want my two cousins to perish at such a young age, right?”

“What do you mean?”Soldier Mu frowned.

“Literally,”Mu Yourong replied.

“Yourong, do you know something?”Soldier Mu narrowed his eyes.

Mu Yourong did not say anything else. She only said, “Dad, Mom, you just have to listen to me. Whether it’s the song family or song Shiyu, they are not good people! As for Ye Zhuo’s fate, you will see it!”

Mu Yourong spoke seriously, and soldier Mu had also seen through her.

This daughter of his was intelligent and beautiful. She never did useless things.

She definitely had her own reasons for doing so.

Soldier Mu turned to look at Shen Rong. “Since yourong has already said so, you should follow yourong to the Ye family later.”

Although Shen Rong was a little displeased, she could only nod. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

At these words, soldier mu seemed to have thought of something and said, “Yourong, since the person that old master Yang wants to find is you, then hurry up and go find him and make things clear. It’s almost the New Year, and Cy Company’s cooperation case can not be delayed.”

“There’s no rush.”Mu Yourong smiled.

Since Old Master Yang had come all the way from the capital, it meant that he valued her, his life savior, very much.

If she went to Old Master Yang, wouldn’t it be too demeaning?

Moreover, when she was in the capital, Old Master Yang had chased her out of the Yang family.

This time, she had to let Old Master Yang personally apologize to her! She had to let Old Master Yang know how it felt to slap her own face.

She was the descendant of the Godly Doctor Hua Tuo!

How could she be easily offended?

The 25th of December.

According to the customs of the cloud capital, today was the day to receive the Jade Emperor.

The Ye family happened to be on the first floor, so ye Shu placed the sacrificial table in the garden that she had brought with her to the first floor. She placed the offerings and kowtowed several times very seriously.

“Aunt Ye.”

A very familiar voice.

Ye Shu raised her head and saw Mu Yourong.

This daughter that she had raised for eighteen years.

“Y-yourong?”Ye Shu found it somewhat inconceivable.

Mu Yourong had returned to the MU family for almost half a year.

This was the first time she had come back to see her.

Subconsciously, ye Shu felt that Mu Yourong did not have any good intentions when she came to find her this time.

This child had always had very strange thoughts.

She was also not close to her.

Although the two of them were once mother and daughter, their mother-daughter love was as thin as a piece of paper.

Mu yourong smiled and said, “Auntie Ye, let me introduce you. This is my mother.”

Shen Rong’s lips curled into a stiff smile as she nodded at Ye Shu.

Ye Shu continued, “Quickly come in and take a seat.”

A room with three bedrooms and one living room.

It was not very big.

Mu yourong sized up the environment in the room.

Her eyes were filled with disdain.

Logically speaking, with ye Zao’s current position on the Miao Yin platform, the profits should be quite good.

How could it be his turn to live in such a shabby house?

Could it be that ye Sen, that gambler who did not want to make any progress, had lost all his money?

Ye Zao was still live streaming on the wonderful sound platform, and his days were still passable.

Once ye Zao did not lose his popularity on the wonderful sound platform, they might have to return to the basement again.

Soon!

She was about to regain her beauty and glory, and her chess skills were outstanding. What was ye Zao to her?

Ye Zao could not even compare to one of her little fingers!

Mu Yourong’s eyes flashed with a proud light as she continued, “Aunt Ye, my mother and I are here to give you a new year present. Right, is Sister Ye Zao not at Home?”

Ye Shu was not the kind of person who liked to take advantage of others. Moreover, ye Shu felt that Mu Yourong was like a weasel paying new year’s greetings to a chicken. “Yourong, you’re too polite! We can’t accept this new year present.”

Mu yourong smiled and said, “There’s no reason to take back a gift that you brought back. Just accept it.”

Ye Shu still declined.

Shen Rong stood by the side.
