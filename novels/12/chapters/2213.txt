“At that time, even if Manwen did not confess, he would not be able to save his life. ”

“If he died in the dark room, he would be committing suicide without a crime! ”

He believed that the people would be very satisfied with this result.

“After all, Manwen was now an existence that had to be executed ”

“Other than a few trusted aides, no one knew that the Shangguan family had tamed the neck of a pheasant, so no one could find out that Manwen had been bitten to death by the neck of a pheasant. ”

“The leading man continued, “You guys go first. I still have something to do.” ”

“Okay.”

“The leading man came all the way to the president’s office, Manxing’s office. ”

“Man Wen sat at his desk and poured him a cup of tea. “Mr. Shangguan, please take a seat.” ”

Shangguan Tengran leaned over and sat opposite Manxing.

“I heard that Mr. Shangguan likes tea. How do you like the taste of this tea?”

Man Xing handed the tea over.

“Shangguan Tengran took the Teacup, but his hand was placed on man Xing’s hand. The two of them were in a stalemate, “Miss Xing ‘er, I have taken care of everything. Even if man Wen doesn’t confess this time, he will only end up committing suicide.” ”

Man Xing was not angry. She let Shangguan Tengran hold her hand like this.

She wanted Manwen to be doomed forever.

And Shangguan Tengran wanted her promise.

“An equal exchange, which was very fair. ”

Manxing was a person who would do anything for the final result.

“No matter what the means, as long as the final goal could be achieved, it was the winner. ”

“The winner was the king, and the loser was the bandit. ”

“Can I believe the words of a man?”Manxing curled her lips.

“Shangguan Tengran clenched man Xing’s hand tightly, as if he could only contain man Xing in his eyes. “Xing ‘er, if you don’t believe me, just wait and see the result.” ”

“Okay.”Man Xing nodded. “I’ll wait for Mr. Shangguan’s result.”

“As he finished speaking, man Xing gently pulled his hand out. ”

“Shangguan Tengran took a sip of tea, closed his eyes, and sighed. “Good tea.” ”

“”Mr. Shangguan, if you like it, you can bring some back,”man Xing said. ”

“Shangguan Tengran smiled and said, “Compared to the ones I brought back, I prefer the ones made by Miss Man Xing herself.” ”

Man Xing smiled and said nothing.

“Shangguan Tengran continued, “If man Wen commits suicide because of guilt, can miss man Xing ‘er fulfill her promise?” ”

“Yes.”Man Xing ‘er nodded.

“Shangguan Tengran stood up from his chair, “Okay, then please wait and see Miss Xing ‘Er.” ”

“I’ll be waiting for your good news.”

“Goodbye.”Shangguan Tengran said to Manxing.

Manxing stood up to send Shangguan Tengran off.

“The goddess of the past was walking beside him, and Shangguan Tengran’s heart was beating fast. ” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Thump, thump, thump, he almost jumped out of his chest. ”

He had always liked Manxing since he was young.

“Manxing was not only beautiful, but also extremely intelligent. In manxing country, as long as a Manxing was second, no one would dare to be second. ”

“Shangguan Tengran’s adolescence was full of stars, and the rest of his life was also full of stars. ”

He had never thought that one day he would be able to successfully hold the goddess’hand.

“When he reached the door, Manxing stopped and said, “Mr. Shangguan, I’ll send you here.” ”

“”Okay.”Shangguan Tengran turned to look at man Xing and said, “Miss Xing ‘er, don’t worry. I won’t bother you again until this matter is settled.” ”

“Okay.”Man Xing nodded.

Shangguan Tengran turned around and left

Man Xing looked at Shangguan Tengran’s back and smiled.

Shangguan Tengran was indeed capable.

Unfortunately.

He was not smart enough.

“After ye Han returned from Grandmother Fei’s place, he made a trip to the civilian areas of Manxing Kingdom. ”

“There were three, six, and nine grades of people in Manxing Kingdom. ”

The rich areas were filled with black technology and flying planes.

“The civilian areas were relatively quieter, and the houses were somewhat crowded. There were almost no flying vehicles, and people relied on star-armored vehicles to travel. ”

“If the rich areas were said to be a peaceful nest on Earth, then the civilian areas were a well-off life, while the slums were hell on Earth, filled with blood and killing. ”

“After Man Wen took office, he had always wanted to change this situation. ”

“Unfortunately, before he could start to change, he was plotted against by man Xing. ”

Ye Han successfully found the address given to him by Grandma Fei and knocked on the door of a house.

“Soon, the door opened. ”

The one who opened the door was a pregnant woman with a big belly.

“”You, you are?”The pregnant woman was stunned when she saw man Wen. ”

“”I’m Grandmother Fei’s grandnephew,”ye Han continued, “She has something to tell you. Is it convenient for you to come in and take a seat?” ”

“The pregnant woman hesitated at first, then nodded. “You can come in.” ”

Ye Han followed the pregnant woman’s footsteps.

The two of them entered the house together.

“The pregnant woman looked back somewhat embarrassedly. “The house is a little messy, don’t mind it.” ”
