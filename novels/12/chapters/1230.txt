“Chapter 1231: 259: Like Father, like son. If you don’t seek death, you won’t Die! 7”

Translator: 549690339

“”My hair is long and my knowledge is short?”Mrs. Qian said unhappily, “I think it’s obvious that you don’t care about our Xiaochuan’s marriage at all! No matter what, Xiaochuan is still your biological son. How can you treat him like this! Are you still worthy of being a father!” ”

Mrs. Qian didn’t like a woman with a brain problem to be her daughter-in-law.

She was even more afraid of others poking her in the back.

“Qian dafu continued, “Zhao Xueyin graduated from a famous university abroad in the finance department. She has a doctorate degree at such a young age! Now, it’s just a wall falling down and everyone pushing it down! If she takes a fancy to our Xiao Chuan, that’s a great blessing from her ancestors! You still look down on her?” ”

Mrs. Qian was stunned.

“Qian dafu sighed and said, “Now that I’m getting older year by year, I don’t feel at Ease handing over the financial group to others. Xiao Chuan is also an unstable person, so we must find him a capable daughter-in-law.” ”

“Mrs. Qian understood now, but she was still a little worried. “But she’s an outsider after all... do you feel at ease if I really hand over the financial group to her?” ”

“”If I don’t hand it over to her, do I have to hand it over to Xiao Chuan?”Qian Dafu asked back. ”

“Although Zhao Xueyin was an outsider, once she married Qian Xiao Chuan and gave birth to a child, she wouldn’t be an outsider anymore! ”

Mrs. Qian choked.

“Qian Dafu continued, “Forget it, forget it. You wouldn’t understand even if I told you. Anyway, this matter has been decided. Tomorrow morning, Liu Sanniang and I will bring Xiaochuan to the Zhao family to take a look.” ”

Mrs. Qian looked at Qian Dafu’s back and did not say a word for a long time.

“On the Zhao family’s side, Father Zhao had already received a call from Liu Sanniang. “Okay, sure.” ”

“Just as he hung up the phone, Zhao Xueyin walked in from outside. “Dad.” ”

“”You’re back?”Father Zhao raised his eyelids, but there wasn’t any special expression on his face. ”

Zhao Xueyin was stunned. Father Zhao wasn’t angry anymore?

“At this moment, father Zhao continued, “Don’t go out tomorrow morning if you have nothing to do. Accompany me to meet an important guest at home.” ”

“Important guest?”Zhao Xueyin subconsciously felt that this matter wasn’t simple. “Who?”

“Father Zhao put down the cup in his hand. “Liu Sanniang has introduced him to you. Tomorrow morning, the man will come over.” ”

Blind Date? !

Father Zhao actually wanted to set her up on a blind date?

She needed a blind date?

“Which one?”Zhao Xueyin continued to ask.

“”The Qian Financial Group,”Father Zhao replied. ”

“That fool Qian Xiaochuan?”Zhao Xueyin’s eyes were filled with disbelief.

“In the entire financial world, who did not know that Qian Xiaochuan was a fool who could not even recognize Arabic numerals! ”

“Father Zhao said angrily, “Fool? Who are you calling a fool? Xiaochuan, that child, is just a little honest, right? An honest person has the benefits of an honest person! Other things aside, he is more than enough for you!” ”

“Zhao Xueyin’s entire body was trembling. She never dreamed that one day, her biological father would introduce her to a fool! ”

“”No!”Zhao xueyin screamed hysterically, “I don’t agree!” ”

“Father Zhao looked at Zhao Xueyin, “How noble do you think you are! If you are so noble, why didn’t the lawyer want you? Why didn’t Master Five Want You?” ”

“”Let me tell you, this matter is settled! Tomorrow is just a formality!” ”

“At this moment, her phone rang in the air. ”

“Zhao Xueyin took out her phone and tried to calm herself down, “Hello.” ”

“It was unknown what was said on the other end, but Zhao Xueyin continued, “Alright, I’ll be right there.” ”

“After hanging up the phone, Zhao Xueyin looked up at Father Zhao. “Dad, let’s talk about this later tonight. I’ll make a trip to the consortium first.” ”

“After saying that, Zhao Xueyin turned around and left. ”

“Very soon, Zhao Xueyin arrived at the consortium. ”

“Just as she arrived at the entrance of the consortium, she saw ye Zhuo talking to a few foreigners. ”

These people were commissioners who came from abroad to investigate.

“She did not know what ye Zao said, but the few commissioners’eyes were filled with admiration. ”

Zhao Xueyin pinched her fingers unwillingly.

“Only the chief was qualified to receive the commissioners personally. Therefore, in the past, Zhao Xueyin was the one who received the commissioners. ”

Everything that ye Zao enjoyed now should be hers!

It should be hers.

Her life should have been incomparably brilliant. It was ye Zao who snatched away the glory that belonged to her!

“After a long while, Zhao Xueyin finally reacted and continued to walk inside. ”

“Meow!”

“When she reached the corner, a big fat cat ran out from inside. ”

Was this ye Zao’s Cat?

“Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes. In a flash, she squatted on the ground and waved at the Big Fat Cat. “Mimi, come here.” ”

“Big Fat Cat glanced at Zhao Xueyin. Not only did it not go over, it turned around and walked back. ”

This damn cat!

It actually dared to point its butt at her! Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Zhao Xueyin’s eyes were filled with anger.

Wait!

“Whether it was a human or a cat, she wanted them to pay the price. ”

Zhao Xueyin stood up and walked towards the office.

“When Zhao Xueyin walked out of the office again, there was a bag of dried fish in her hand. ”

“”Mimi, come here. I have some dried fish here.” ”

“Fat Meow licked its paws. In the end, it could not resist the temptation. It walked towards Zhao Xueyin and picked up the dried fish. Just as it was about to walk back, it was suddenly picked up by someone. ”

“Looking at the big fat meow in her arms, Zhao Xueyin curled the corners of her lips. Her eyes were full of viciousness. ”

Big Fat Meow seemed to have sensed something as it struggled violently. “Meow!”

“Not long after Zhao Xueyin left, Little White came out of the elevator. “Silly cat! Silly Cat! Where are you hiding? I Can’t find you! I admit defeat. Come out quickly, okay duck!” ”

It had been searching for a long time but could not find brother Meow. Little White had no choice but to return to ye Zao’s office. “Big Zao!”

“What’s Wrong?”Ye Zao looked back slightly.

“Little White continued, “Silly cat is missing! I’ve searched for it several times but could not find it! Do you think it was tricked by the bad guys with the dried fish?” ”
