“Chapter 1234: 258: Great Scorch attack, kill Zhao Xueyin! 3”

Translator: 549690339

Bang!

“Meow-“big fat meow let out a mournful howl.

This wasn’t over yet.

Zhao Xueyin walked over again.

Big Fat Meow looked at Zhao Xueyin who was walking over and couldn’t help but step back.

“”Meow, Meow…” ”

Big Fat Meow’s voice grew louder and louder each time.

However.

The soundproof effect of the office was too good. Its voice couldn’t penetrate through at all.

“Seeing that Zhao Xueyin was getting closer and closer to it, Big Fat Cat used all its strength and jumped up with all its might! ”

Pa..

“With its super high jumping ability, big fat cat jumped onto the decorations on the wall just like that. ”

“”Jump, I’ll Let You Jump!”Zhao Xueyin walked over, grabbed big fat cat’s leg and pulled it down. ”

Her eyes were full of malice.

Ye Zao!

It was all ye Zao!

“If it weren’t for ye Zao, she wouldn’t be in this state today. ”

It was all because of ye Zao!

“Ye Zao first stole her fifth master, then stole Si lui. ”

“In the end, ye Zao even stole Shunxi Financial Group! ”

Shameless!

“If it weren’t for ye Zao, she would be fifth master’s fiancée, the head of Shunxi Financial Group! ”

She wouldn’t have been introduced to the Qian family by Father Zhao!

“She was the bright moon in the sky, the flower of wealth in the human world. She should be on par with the most outstanding person in the world! ”

What was the point of introducing a fool to her?

This was a huge insult to Zhao Xueyin!

“The more she thought about it, the stronger the hatred in Zhao Xueyin’s eyes became. ”

“Ye Zhuo! B * Tch! I’m going to kill you!”

Zhao Xueyin looked as if she had mistaken big fat meow for ye Zao.

“Meow…”

Big Fat Meow was strangled and could hardly breathe.

“A moment later, Zhao Xueyin let go of Big Fat Meow’s neck and a faint light flashed in her eyes. ”

Zhao Xueyin carried big fat meow to the office desk and found a sharp dagger…

“About ten minutes later, someone knocked on the office door. ”

“Come in.”

“Hearing the voice, the person outside pushed the door open and came in. “Miss Zhao.” ”

“Zhao Xueyin looked up, and the disgust in her eyes became even more obvious. ”

This was ye Zhuo’s disgusting robot.

“Zhao Xueyin knew that this robot was different from ordinary robots, so she continued, “What’s the matter?” ”

“Little White looked inside and said very politely, “Miss Zhao, have you seen the silly cat?” ”

“No.”

“”OH.”Little White scratched its head. “Sorry to bother you, I’ll go out first.” ”

Zhao Xueyin did not say anything.

It was not until little white closed the door that she kicked out a bloody mass from the corner.

The floor was stained with blood.

The mass was just lying there. Its fur was gone and the air was exposed to blood-red muscle tissue. Its chest was slightly undulating. It was barely visible that it was a living creature.

It was a shocking sight.

“However, Zhao Xueyin still had a smile on her face. ”

A sinister smile.

…

“Little White went to ye Zao’s office and said anxiously, ”

“”Da Zao Zao, I’ve looked for it several times, but I still haven’t found the silly cat. Do you think she really lost it?” ”

“You still haven’t found it?”Ye Zao raised his eyes slightly. “There’s nothing on the 33rd floor?”

“No.”

Little White shook its head. “I even went to Zhao Xueyin’s office!”

Ye Zhuo frowned slightly.

He subconsciously felt that something was wrong.

Brother Meow was a very spiritual meow.

It knew the way and recognized its master. It would definitely not run around and would definitely not get lost.

“I’ll check the surveillance footage.”

“Little White continued, “I’ve checked the surveillance footage of the four doors. The silly cat didn’t go out!” ”

“What about the surveillance cameras on the corridor on the 58th floor?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“I don’t have that.”Xiao Bai shook his head. “I don’t have the authority to check the surveillance cameras on the corridor.”

“Originally, Xiao Bai could climb over the wall to check, but because the internal surveillance cameras were personally reinforced by ye Zhuo, Xiao Bai couldn’t climb over the wall. ”

Ye Zhuo operated the computer with one hand and pressed the keyboard until it crackled.

“In a short while, the video was brought up. ”

It was a video from two hours ago. Brother Meow was walking leisurely in the corridor.

“Other than the video from two hours ago, brother Meow was no longer on the surveillance. ”

There was only one possibility now.

Brother Meow had been taken away by someone.

And the other party was a person who knew the location of the financial group’s surveillance very well.

“If that was really the case, brother Meow was still on the 58th floor. ”CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Thinking of this, Ye Zhuo closed his computer and walked out. ”

Little White immediately followed ye Zhuo’s footsteps.

“Ally asked curiously, “Chief, are you looking for Brother Meow?” ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “You saw it?”
