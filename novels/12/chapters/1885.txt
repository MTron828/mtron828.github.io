“Mm.”Fang Yueyin nodded. “As long as you know what you’re doing.”

On the other side.

Li Shuyi returned home.

“Her mother, Linda, was sitting on the sofa, doing her nails. When she saw her return, she asked curiously, “Why are you back so soon? Have you told them what happened?” ”

“Li Shuyi was Linda’s daughter, so the mother and daughter had the same temperament. ”

Linda’s surname was Jones.

Jones was a high-class surname in C nation.

“Under normal circumstances, girls from high-class families would not marry outside. ”

“Even if they married, they had to marry high. ”

It was rare for someone like Linda to marry a Chinese who had nothing.

“Therefore, Linda always felt that she had married low. ”

She looked down on Li Erzhu and his relatives.

“Because in the eyes of C Nation, China had always been a relatively backward country. ”

“If it weren’t for Li Sanzhu, she would never have come to such a godforsaken place. ”

There was nothing but cows and sheep.

It was simply boring and uninteresting.

“Hearing this, Li Shuyi said, “Not yet. When I went, they just happened to have a guest.” ”

“”I see.”Linda nodded and continued, “Tell them about it as soon as possible so that John can be at ease.” ”

“Li Shuyi frowned slightly and said, “What if Li Yueyue doesn’t agree?” ”

“Linda was not worried about this at all. She snorted and continued, “To be able to marry a high-class family name of our Jones family, I don’t know how many lifetimes she has cultivated it. What’s there to be unhappy about?” ”

“How many people wanted to marry into their family? They had no idea! Now that they had taken the initiative to mention this matter, Li Yueyue was secretly happy! How could she not agree? ”

“Originally, Linda had also looked down on Li Yueyue. ”

“The Jones family had the supreme ease in C nation. Unfortunately, in the past two years, the new king had been taking over. He had intentionally or unintentionally suppressed the Jones family and even monopolized the Jones family’s business with the royal family. ”

“At the moment, the Jones family only looked good, but they had already been torn apart. ”

“Li Sanzhu’s wealth had long passed 100 million, and Li Yueyue was the only daughter of the couple. Li Sanzhu had previously personally promised that if anyone married Li Yueyue, they would use half of the grassland as a dowry, and.., give 15% of the shares. ”

“At the moment, the Jones family was greatly weakened, and Li Sanzhu was rich. As long as the two families were married, they would definitely be able to improve the situation of the Jones family. ”

“Hearing this, Li Shuyi nodded. “You’re quite right.” ”

“Linda placed the nail polish on the coffee table and said, “Go back tonight and try to settle this matter as soon as possible.” ”

“Okay.”

“After saying this, Li Shuyi went back upstairs. ”

On the other side.

Changyue country.

Time passed quickly.

“In the blink of an eye, five days had passed. ”

“During these five days, Shangguan Jue had been investigating the relationship between Ye Zhuo and Qiu Di. ”

“In the end, he came to the conclusion that Qiu di was telling the truth. ”

“First, Qiu di said that she had saved ye Zhuo once when she was a child. ”

Ye Zao was just a little bit away from staying in the Qiu family as a servant.

“Shangguan Jue personally went to investigate. Ye Zao, who was an orphan back then, did indeed have such an experience. ”

“Second, Ye Han’s amnesia and changing his name were all done by Ye Zao himself. ”

“Other than ye Zao, the only other person in changyue who had this ability was the great witch doctor. ”

“But according to reliable information, the Great Witch Doctor’s soul had already returned to his hometown a few years ago. ”

Therefore.

“The only explanation was that ye Zhuo had predicted his own ending in advance. In order to prevent ye Han from being sad, he had changed ye Han’s memory and changed his name. ”

“After having a direction, the great patriarch immediately called for a meeting of the other seven patriarchs. ”

“Other than the three patriarchs, everyone else was very supportive of the Great Patriarch’s decision. ”

They handed the information of the star-crossing case to Qiu Di and told her the password to the information of the star-crossing case.

“The three clan leaders said, “I want to see him alive, and I want to see his corpse even if he dies! It’s said that the Great Witch Doctor is dead, but have any of you seen his corpse? In short, other than Miss Ye, I don’t recognize anyone as a female monarch!” ”

Ye Zhuo was the first female monarch of the Chang Yue country.

“Now, it was absolutely impossible for Qiu di to replace Ye Zhuo’s position. ”

“The head patriarch stood up and said, “Second, I know what you mean, but Miss Ye has already gone. “Since autumn flute is someone whom miss ye entrusted to her, then she definitely has something extraordinary. We don’t believe in autumn flute, but we still have to believe in Miss Ye.” ”

“Hearing this, the three patriarchs frowned and did not say anything. ”
