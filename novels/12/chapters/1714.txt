The experimental field was not far from the base. They would arrive in ten minutes on the Mars rover.

Tang mi jumped out of the rover. “Come and take a look! The sprouting potatoes are right here!”

Yu Zifei and Cen he also jumped out of the rover.

“Tang mi carefully pushed aside the soil covering the potatoes. Immediately, a purple round bud popped out, tender and tender. “Look, isn’t it amazing!” ”

“On Earth, sprouting potatoes was the most appropriate thing to do. ”

But where was this place?

Mars!

What did sprouting potatoes on Mars mean?

It meant that Mars was indeed suitable for Life!

“At the same time, it also proved that ye Zhuo’s oasis project was not wrong. ”

“”It sprouted! It really sprouted!”Cen he was so excited that his eyes were slightly red. “If this situation continues, we’ll be able to live a self-sufficient life on Mars in three months!” ”

“Yu Zifei looked at the other potatoes again. Just like the situation here, the other potatoes had all sprouted. ”

It seemed that their direction and goal weren’t wrong.

“Yu Zifei immediately took out his phone to take a photo. When they had their regular meeting later, he had to report this situation. ”

“Cen he looked at Tang Mi and continued, “Have the other plants sprouted?” ”

“Tang mi shook her head. “So far, there hasn’t been any reaction from the other plants.”Other than the potatoes, they had also planted many other crops, but so far, only the potatoes had sprouted. ”

“I’ll go check.”Cen he ran over to the neighboring paddy field.

There was indeed no reaction from the paddy field.

“10:30 am, China time. ”

The regular meeting started on time.

Ye Zhuo appeared at the meeting room’s main seat.

“Seeing ye Zhuo on the video, CEN he said excitedly, “Miss Ye, you’re back! Coincidentally, we have good news to report to you!” ”

Ye Zao smiled faintly. “What Good News?”

“Yu Zifei sent the photo to the big screen. CEN he continued, “The potatoes we planted on Mars have already sprouted!” ”

“Through the screen, one could see that the potatoes planted in the ground had indeed sprouted out small round sprouts. ”

There were also round dewdrops.

“Although it was just a group of sprouted potatoes, it gave people endless hope! ”

“Seeing this scene, everyone in the meeting room stood up and looked at the big screen in disbelief. ”

“Oh my God! It’s sprouting! It’s really sprouting!”

“Are my eyes playing tricks on me?”

“Looks like Mars is really suitable for humans to live on!”

“For a moment, the meeting room was abuzz with discussion. ”

“Ye Zao’s lips curled up slightly. “Thank you for your hard work. In about a week’s time, the seeds of other plants will also sprout one after another. At such a critical moment, you must pay more attention to observe.” ”

“”Yes, Miss Ye!” ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Also, how are the small animals that we brought along?” ”

“Other than the plant seeds and some saplings, they also brought along many small animals. ”

“However, they were all very common poultry. ” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“For example, pigs, dogs, cows, chickens, ducks, rabbits, and so on. ”

“Yu Zifei had just checked the condition of the small animals last night. He continued, “Other than a yellow ox that was in a bad state, everything else is fine.” ”

“What did the veterinarian say?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“Yu Zifei said, “The veterinarian said it’s not a big problem. It’s just that it hasn’t adapted to the Martian environment yet.” ”

“Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “If a large number of animals don’t adapt, or if there are signs, you must report it immediately.” ”

“Yu Zifei nodded. “I know, Miss Ye.” ”

“Until the end of the meeting, the leader of the OASIS project team was still very excited. ”

None of them had expected that plants could really sprout and grow on Mars.

They did not expect that they could see the results in such a short time!

It seemed that human beings would soon be able to migrate to Mars and carry out the interplanetary tourism plan.

“I’m looking forward to the day when Mars is covered by oases more and more!”

“I’m looking forward to it very much too!”

“”Since potatoes can be grown on Mars, Europa is simply a paradise for humans!”Liu Yuan, a former subordinate of professor Feng, said, “I don’t know why Miss Ye has always refused to land on Europa.” ”

“According to the observations of the Hubble telescope, the surface of Europa was much better than that of Mars. ”

“Mars was a barren planet, and its environment was even worse than the deserts of China. Europa, on the other hand, was a planet filled with liquid oceans and green plants. ”

“Compared to the two, everyone would choose Europa! ”

“Shen Xing, who was at the side, added, “Didn’t miss ye say that Europa is only calm on the surface? If Europa is really that good, Miss Ye will definitely not oppose the Europa Plan.” ”
