“Ask me what it is.”

“Aunt Lang continued, “It’s about the recommendation letter. Did you help me pass it out?” ”

“Elder Zhang did not answer Aunt Lang directly. Instead, he stood up and said, “Lang Hua, I have something to tell you too. Come to the study.” ”

Was he trying to avoid suspicion?

“Aunt Lang lowered her head and looked at Jiang Yan. “Little Half Moon, you stay here for a while. I’ll go with elder Zhang.” ”

Jiang Yan nodded. “You go ahead.”

Aunt Lang followed elder Zhang to the study.

“Elder Zhang looked at Aunt Lang and said, “Lang Hua, I won’t beat around the bush. The girl outside is not your biological daughter at all. To tell you the truth, I’ve been investigating Little Half Moon’s matter for the past few days. Finally, my hard work paid off and Cao Wei found someone who looked like little half moon! “Even the Little Red Mole on the right hand side of the mother and daughter looks exactly the same!” ”

“Aunt Lang’s face turned cold. Her eyes were not as happy as elder Zhang had imagined. “Elder Zhang, at this time, you still haven’t given up on this matter? Does this mean that you didn’t help me send the recommendation letter at all?” ”

“In Aunt Lang’s opinion, elder Zhang had deliberately caused so much trouble because he wanted her to return to the financial world. ”

“After all, she had already trusted elder Zhang once and brought a sample to do an appraisal! ”

“However, the result of the appraisal was still the same. ”

“This time, Aunt Lang would not trust elder Zhang anymore. ”

“Seeing Aunt Lang like this, elder Zhang was also very anxious, “Lang Hua, listen to me. I don’t have any other intentions. Even if you don’t want to go into the financial world, I won’t force you. I just don’t want you to be cheated by Xi Muwen again! The one outside is really not your little half moon!” ”

“We’ve done an appraisal! She’s my biological daughter!”

“Elder Zhang continued, “Then it must be XI Muwen’s doing!” ”

“”Since you suspect XI Muwen’s doing something, then I have the right to suspect that you’re doing something as well! Elder Zhang, it’s not easy for me to find little half-moon now. I really don’t want to return to the Financial World Anymore!” ”

“”Lang Hua, calm down! Let’s talk this out!” ”

“”I’m very calm now,”aunt lang continued, “And I know what I’m doing.” ”

“”You Know Miss Ye, right? It’s Ye Zhuo!”Elder Zhang said. ”

“Zhuo Zhuo?”

“Elder Zhang nodded. “I suspect that Miss Ye’s mother, Ye Shu, is the real half a month.” ” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Then, elder Zhang passed the information that Cao Wei found to ye Lang Hua. ”

“”Langhua, this is the information Cao Wei found in Yun Jing.” ”

Aunt Lang took the information and looked at it slowly.

“Elder Zhang continued, “Miss Ye and her mother both have a small red mole on their hands that looks exactly the same. Most importantly, don’t you think that ye Shu looks like you?” ”

Aunt Lang looked at the photo of Ye Shu on the information and was stunned for a moment.

“After a while, she finally reacted, “Little Half Moon also has a little red mole that looks exactly like me. Elder Zhang, do you think that with this Little Red Mole, you can determine that mother searing is my daughter?” ”

“”Since we’ve already said this much, let’s do an appraisal.”Elder Zhang continued, “After the appraisal, the truth will be revealed.” ”

“”But Xiao Banyue and I have already done the appraisal twice!”Aunt Lang continued, “Elder Zhang, if you’re really unwilling to help me deliver the recommendation letter, then I’ll use my own method! I Won’t trouble you anymore!” ”

Appraisal?

“After secretly doing the appraisal the last time, every time Aunt Lang saw Jiang Yan, she felt extremely guilty. ”

She shouldn’t have suspected Jiang Yan!

“If she did another test, it would only burden Aunt Lang. ”

“After saying that, Aunt Lang turned and left. ”

“Lang Hua!”Elder Zhang caught up with Aunt Lang.

Aunt Lang walked outside and held Jiang Yan’s hand. “Let’s go for half a month!”

“Before Jiang Yan could react, she was dragged away by Aunt Lang. ”

“Seeing that he couldn’t catch up with Aunt Lang, elder Zhang didn’t continue to chase after her and sighed helplessly. ”

Outside.

“Jiang Yan looked at Aunt Lang. “Mom, does that elder Zhang not like me?” ”

“Thinking of elder Zhang’s words, Aunt Lang was still a little angry. She said directly, “You’re my daughter. You Don’t need to be liked by him!” ”

“Jiang Yan continued, “Then how is Weiyue’s matter?” ”

“Aunt Lang said, “Don’t worry. I have other ways. I Won’t let Weiyue be happy.” ”

“”That’s good.”Jiang Yan nodded, then, she said, “Mom, since elder Zhang doesn’t like me, I Won’t come with you in the future. I’m sorry, I’ve embarrassed you... You Were a famous talented girl when you were young, but I didn’t even graduate from primary school...” ”

“Seeing Jiang Yan like this, Aunt Lang felt sorry for her. “No, it’s not your fault. It’s all mom’s fault. Mom didn’t do her duty as a mother.” ”

“”Mother, it’s not your fault. I’ve never blamed you before!” ”

In the house.

“Elder Zhang was holding a few strands of silver-white hair in his hands. He called Cao Wei. “Cao Wei, where are you now?” ”

“Cao Wei said, “I’m at Miss Ye’s place, elder Zhang! Let me tell you some good news. Miss ye has pretty much investigated everything that happened back then! Soon, Aunt Lang will be able to see the truth!” ”

“”Good! That’s Good!”Elder Zhang continued, “I’ve also obtained Lang Hua’s hair over here. Let’s meet at the hospital!” ”

“Sure!”

“Half an hour later, elder Zhang appeared at the hospital on time. ”

“Not long after, Cao Wei and Ye Zhuo also arrived. There was a young man standing beside Ye Zhuo. ”

He wore a black hoodie and had a cold temperament. There was a hint of melancholy between his brows.

Could This Be Ye Zhuo’s brother?

“Elder Zhang was stunned for a moment, then quickly went up to greet her. “Miss Ye!” ”

“Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Elder Zhang. Oh right, elder Zhang, let me introduce you. This is my brother, Lin Ze. Brother, this is elder Zhang.” ”

“Lin Ze looked at elder Zhang and politely said, “Hello, elder Zhang. I’m Lin Ze.” ”

“As expected, he was ye Zhuo’s brother. This brother and sister were simply dragons and phoenixes among men! ”

“Elder Zhang’s eyes were filled with admiration. He reached out and shook hands with Lin Ze. “Hello, Mr. Lin.” ”

“After shaking hands, elder Zhang took out a sealed bag containing hair. “Let’s go to the identification department quickly.” ”

“Okay.”

The few of them rushed to the identification department and handed the sample to the doctor.

Time passed very quickly.

“In the blink of an eye, four and a half hours had passed. ”

“The door of the identification department’s office was opened. A doctor in a white coat walked out. “Elder Zhang, the identification results have been released!” ”

“How is it?”Elder Zhang asked impatiently.

“The doctor continued, “The appraisal results show that the two appraisers are biological mother and daughter, which means that the parent-child relationship is established.” ”

“Really?”Elder Zhang suppressed the excitement in his heart.

The doctor nodded and handed the appraisal report to Elder Zhang. “Take a look for yourself.”

“Seeing this, Ye Zhuo and Lin Ze looked at each other and saw the surprise in each other’s eyes. ”
