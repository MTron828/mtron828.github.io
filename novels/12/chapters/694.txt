Translator: 549690339

An Lizi did not expect to meet ye Zao at the Lin family home.

“Looking at Ye Zao, her nervous heart immediately relaxed a lot. ”

“Lizi!”Ye Zao walked over and held an Lizi’s hand.

“Compared to an Lizi’s surprise, Ye Zao was much calmer. After all, she was already mentally prepared. Xia Xiaoman was Lin Qingxuan’s girlfriend. ”

“An Lizi asked ye Zao in a low voice, “Big Zao Zao, why are you here?” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Because Lin Qingxuan is my fourth uncle.” ”

An Lizi then remembered that ye Zao’s biological father was also surnamed Lin.

“However, she never expected that Lin Qingxuan was actually ye Zao’s fourth uncle. ”

“In that case, wouldn’t she be related to Ye Zao in the future? ”

“At the thought of this, an Lizi was a little excited. ”

“Never in her wildest dreams did she expect that one day, she and ye Zao would turn from good friends to Cousins. ”

“From the looks of it, if Xia Xiaoman could marry Lin Qingxuan, it would indeed be a good choice. ”

Ye Shu was also very surprised when he saw Xia Xiaoman and an Lizi.

She was different from ye Zao.

“From the beginning to the end, she did not know that Lin Qingxuan’s girlfriend was actually Xia Xiaoman. ”

Ye Shu felt very familiar to be able to see Xia Xiaoman in the Lin family.

“After all, Xia Xiaoman was also from Yun Jing. ”

“Because of Ye Zhuo, Ye Shu and Xia Xiaoman also had a very good relationship. ”

Ye Shu stood in the crowd and smiled at Xia Xiaoman.

Xia Xiaoman also smiled at Ye Shu.

“Lin Qingxuan held Xia Xiaoman’s hand and walked to Old Lady Lin’s side. “Mom, this is my girlfriend, Xia Xiaoman. Xiaoman, this is my mom.” ”

Old Lady Lin Sized Up Xia Xiaoman.

She looked pretty good.

Her figure was also pretty good.

“Xia Xiaoman raised her head to look at Old Lady Lin and smiled. “Nice to meet you, Auntie.” ”

“Nice to meet you.”Old Lady Lin nodded in satisfaction.

“Judging from Xia Xiaoman’s words and actions, she was probably from a prestigious family. ”

“Lin Qingxuan pointed at an lizi and said, “Oh right, Mom, this is Xiaoman’s daughter, Lizi. Lizi and Zhuluo are high school classmates! Lizi, this is Grandma.” ”

Daughter?

Xia Xiaoman’s Daughter?

Xia Xiaoman actually has a daughter!

“Upon hearing this, Old Lady Lin was a little uneasy. ”

She didn’t expect Xia Xiaoman to actually be a second wife.

“She originally thought that Xia Xiaoman was like Jiang Suran, a young lady who married late. ”

“Upon hearing that it was a second marriage, Old Lady Lin felt as if someone had poured a bucket of cold water on her, from head to toe. ”

It was extremely uncomfortable!

“Even though Lin Qingxuan was also a second marriage, the Lin family’s business was huge, and Lin Qingxuan was capable. He could definitely marry a girl of equal status. ”

What was the point of marrying a second marriage?

“Furthermore, who knew if Xia Xiaoman had a vasectomy. ”

Would she still give birth? !

“If she didn’t give birth, why would Lin Qingxuan marry her back? ”

“An Lizi politely greeted Old Lady Lin. “Hello, Grandma.” ”

Old Lady Lin tried her best to maintain the self-restraint of a wealthy old lady. “Okay.” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Lin Qingxuan then introduced everyone in the Lin family to Xia Xiaoman and an Lizi.

“There were too many people in the Lin family. From four uncles, ten cousins, plus ye Zhuo and Lin Ze, there were a total of twelve people of the same generation as an Lizi. ”

“Plus, there were eight cousins and five little guys. They recognized an Lizi and were dazzled. Fortunately, Ye Zhuo was by her side. Otherwise, an Lizi would have broken down. ”

Ye Zhuo brought an lizi along to mingle around the cousins.

An Lizi found that the Lin family was very friendly and easy to get along with. It was completely different from what she imagined from a wealthy family.

“Especially the five little ones, who were very welcoming of her arrival. ”

“On the other side, Ye Shu and Xia Xiaoman were chatting and laughing in front of the three sisters-in-law of the Lin family. ”

“With an acquaintance like ye Shu around, Xia Xiaoman felt much more relaxed. ”

“The sisters-in-law of the Lin family were all reasonable people. They didn’t deliberately make things difficult for Xia Xiaoman. Instead, they were very warm to Xia Xiaoman. ”

“Wu Mei smiled and said, “Xiaoman, does that mean that you and your fifth brother and sister-in-law are from the same hometown?” ”

“Xia Xiaoman nodded and said, “Yes, mother burning and I are both from Yun Jing.” ”

“Zhang Zhenzhen teased, “What burning mother! You should change your way of addressing your fifth brother and sister-in-law!” ”

“Yang Wenyin immediately followed, “Right, right, right. Xiaoman, I think you should change your way of addressing your fifth brother and sister-in-law.” ”

Everyone wanted to hear Xia Xiaoman call ye Shu “Fifth brother and sister.”.

“Lin Qingxuan walked over and said, “Second sister-in-law, Xiaoman is thin-skinned. Don’t scare her.” ”

“Xia Xiaoman didn’t think much of it at first, but after hearing Lin Qingxuan’s words, she immediately blushed. ”

“Zhang Zhenzhen teased, “TSK, TSK, tsk. In the end, fourth brother is the one who knows how to feel sorry for someone, so he protected her just like that. Look, I’ve been talking here for a long time, but I haven’t seen your second brother come over to help me out.” ”
