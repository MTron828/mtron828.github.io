Chapter 172: 087: tearing the mistress apart, divorce! 8

Xia Xiaoman suddenly laughed, “An dongliang, you didn’t even think about breaking up with her, right?”

An dongliang quickly said, “Xiaoman, I’m sorry! I apologize to you! But this matter has nothing to do with Xinyi. I’m the one who pursued her. I beg you, please don’t make things difficult for her, okay? I beg you!”

“Do you want to break up with her or not?”

“Break! Break it right now!”An Dongliang immediately nodded.

Xia Xiaoman continued, “Since it’s about to be broken, what’s the point of worrying so much? We’re going to fall out sooner or later anyway! An Dongliang, if you don’t ask her out today, this matter won’t be over!”

“Xiaoman! I’m kneeling down for You! I really know my mistake! Don’t go and make things difficult for xinyi, okay!”As he said this, an Dongliang knelt down and reached out to hug Xia Xiaoman’s leg.

“For the sake of that B * tch, you actually knelt down for me! An Dongliang! You’re a man! There’s gold under a man’s knees!”Xia Xiaoman’s tears began to flow. “Is that B * Tch worth it for you to do this?”

They had been married for twenty years.

An Dongliang had not even washed her clothes. He said that a man should be upright and upright. What was the point of washing clothes for a woman?

That was because Xia Xiaoman felt that the man she had her eyes on was different. He had the manliness of a man!

But now, he had actually knelt down for another woman!

How ironic!

How ironic!

......

“Xinyi is not a B * tch! She is the kindest and most innocent woman I have ever seen!”An Dongliang suddenly stood up from the ground. “She only killed with her head on the ground! I have knelt down before, what more do you want from me!”

An Dongliang used to think that his wife was a kind and understanding woman.

Now, it seemed that he had misjudged her after so many years!

Compared to Liang Xinyi who was well-read, Xia Xiaoman was a shrew.

A country bumpkin was a country bumpkin!

No matter how many years she had lived in the city, she could not become a city bumpkin!

If he could return to the past, he would never marry a shrew like Xia Xiaoman!

“I want you to break up with that B * Tch! It’s going to happen soon!”Xia Xiaoman could hardly control her emotions.

“I told you! Xinyi is not a B * tch! She is not!”Said an Dongliang with bloodshot eyes

An Dongliang could not stand Xia Xiaoman pointing at Liang Xinyi as a B * TCH.

Liang Xinyi was the woman he loved deeply!

He would never allow anyone to insult Liang Xinyi.

“She is! She is!”Xia Xiaoman shouted angrily, “She is a slut who sleeps with thousands of people! A slut! Seducing someone else’s husband, she will not have a good ending! She will go to hell! She will only be a B * Tch for the rest of her life! In the future, her children will be like her, men will steal and women will be prostitutes!” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Slut! Shut Up!”An Dongliang could not take it anymore. He gave Xia Xiaoman a slap and kicked her to the ground.

He was still angry. He grabbed Xia Xiaoman by her hair and slammed her against the floor.

She was like a mad animal!

Soon, Xia Xiaoman’s head was bleeding.

“Mom!”An Lizi heard that something was wrong in the room. She ran out to take a look and was scared to tears. “Let go of my mom! B * Stard!”

“Lizi, go back to the house!”

Xia Xiaoman did not want her daughter to see this scene. She was afraid that it would leave a shadow in an Lizi’s heart.

“Let go of my mom!”An Lizi pushed an dongliang hard. “Let go of my mom!”

“You’re not a good person either! Just like your mom! Both of you are not good people!”An Dongliang pushed an lizi away. “You’re not my daughter! I don’t have a daughter like you!”

If it was not for an Lizi coming to find trouble with Liang Xinyi today, things would not have developed to this stage?

Everything was fine last night!

They were father and daughter, but an Lizi was trying to change the situation!

An Lizi was stunned. She hit her head on the floor and felt a tearing pain.

“Lizi!”

Xia Xiaoman ignored the injury on her head and got up to hug an Lizi. “An Dongliang, you’re not human! Lizi is your biological daughter!”

An Dongliang pointed at Xia Xiaoman and said, “Xia Xiaoman! Let me tell you! I’ve had enough of you shrew! If you want a divorce, then divorce!”

The reason why he dared to say that he wanted a divorce was because Xia Xiaoman loved him.

He knew that Xia Xiaoman did not dare to divorce him at all.

Back then, in order to marry him, Xia Xiaoman not only did not take a single cent of the dowry, she even gave him a few hundred yuan.

If Xia Xiaoman dared to divorce him, she would not be in this state!

After saying this, an Dongliang turned around and left.

Liang xinyi was still feeling wronged and waiting for him to comfort her.

Since he had already fallen out with her, there was no need for him to continue pretending.

Xia Xiaoman looked at the man’s heartless back view with disappointment in her eyes.

It had been 20 years.

In the end, she still made the wrong payment.

“Mom, let’s get a divorce!”An Lizi looked at Xia Xiaoman.

Xia Xiaoman nodded. “Okay.”

Xia Xiaoman was originally prepared to forgive an Dongliang for an Lizi’s sake.

Now it seemed like.

There was no need for that.

A man would even hit his wife and child for the sake of a mistress. What else could he not do?

This marriage!

Must be divorced!

“That’s great! You’ve finally figured it out!”An Lizi hugged Xia Xiaoman. “Mom, I believe that we’ll have a better life in the future!”
