“Soon after, Cen Shaoqing also sat in the driver’s seat. ”

“The speed of the car was neither fast nor slow. Ten minutes later, the car steadily stopped in front of the Cen family manor. ”

“Immediately, a servant came up to greet him. “Fifth Master.” ”

Cen Shaoqing handed the car keys to him. “Park in the garage.”

“Okay.”The servant nodded.

Cen Shaoqing held ye Zao’s hand and put it into the pocket of his coat.

The two of them walked into the manor together.

“Hearing footsteps, old Mrs. Cen smiled and looked up. “They’re here! They’re here!” ”

“Sitting opposite Old Mrs. Cen was a middle-aged woman. She smiled and said, “Aunt, I’ve long heard that Shaoqing’s fiancée is the same as the one in the painting. This time, I’m finally going to see her in person!” ”

“This person was old Mrs. Cen’s distant niece, called Chen Lanfang. She would come to the Cen family to pay New Year’s greetings every year. Unfortunately, she did not see ye Zhuo at the Cen family last year. ”

“”An ordinary person. My granddaughter-in-law is an ordinary person.”Old Mrs. Cen said in a very low-key manner, “I’m not from the Appearance Association. As long as the two children can see eye to eye, that’s enough.” ”

“Hearing this, Chen Lanfang frowned. What old Mrs. Cen meant was that ye Zao was not as good-looking as the rumors said? ”

“At this moment, the footsteps outside the door were getting closer and closer. ”

“”Grandma, we’re Back!”Cen Shaoqing’s voice sounded in the air. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen stood up and said with a smile, “There was no traffic jam on the road, right?” ”

“There was no traffic jam.”

“Old Mrs. Cen held ye Zao’s hand and continued, “Zao Zao, this is your cousin Lan Fang. Lan Fang, this is Shao Qing’s girlfriend, Zao Zao.” ”

Chen Lan Fang was stunned.

“This, this was the ordinary person that old Mrs. Cen had mentioned. ”

“When she heard Old Mrs. Cen say that ye Zao was an ordinary person, Chen Lan Fang thought that ye Zao’s looks were ordinary and not as good-looking as the rumors said. She did not expect that ye Zao’s looks were even better than the rumors said. ”

How was this an ordinary person.

“If this was an ordinary person, what would she be? ”

Scum?

Three kinds of people!

“Ye Zao greeted politely, “Cousin Lanfang.” ”

“”Oh my goodness!”Chen Lanfang was so excited that she even blurted out her hometown words, “This is not an ordinary person! This is simply a fairy from the nine heavens! My Great-grandmother, your granddaughter-in-law is too beautiful, right?” ”

“Old Lady Cen’s face was full of smiles, but she still said modestly, “Ordinary people, ordinary people, it’s not that exaggerated.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing slightly lowered his eyes and whispered in ye Zao’s ear, “Grandma is simply a Versailles competition.” ”

“”Tsk,”ye Zao teased, “You, a monk, still know Versailles literature.” ”

“”That’s right, I don’t only know Versailles literature, I know a lot of it.” ”Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“You’re bragging.”

“The two whispered to each other. In the eyes of outsiders, it was a beautiful and vivid scene. ”

“Chen Lanfang turned to look at Old Mrs. Cen and continued, “Aunt, I’ve finally seen it today! Even our village’s Flower Shiyu isn’t as beautiful as searing! You’re too modest!” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen waved her hands repeatedly. “Not modest, not at all modest. Look at searing searing searing, it’s just two eyes and a nose! It’s so ordinary that it can’t be any more ordinary!”She had only recently learned Versailles literature, she just wanted to show it off. Versailles literature was indeed useful. ”

“Chen Lanfang:”…”she felt that her aunt was showing off, but she had no evidence. ”

“At this moment, the Butler rushed in. “Old Lady! Old Lady!” ”

“What’s Wrong?”Old Mrs. Cen asked.

“The butler continued, “The security department called. They said that there’s a relative outside who claims to be from his hometown to wish you a happy new year. Do you want to let her in?” ”

“”Let me see the video,”old Mrs. Cen said. ”

“Okay.”The housekeeper took out her tablet and connected to the security department’s video.

A white-haired old man appeared on the screen. He was holding a five-or six-year-old child.

It was already the 21st century. The child’s clothes were still covered with patches. There were two snot-nosed girls hanging from his nose. His little face was red from the cold.

“Old Mrs. Cen looked at him for a long time, but she still couldn’t tell who he was. ”

“At this moment, the old man smiled and spoke, “Haifeng’s mother! I’m xiue, Ma Xiue! Isn’t that niece of mine married to the son of the eldest uncle, the daughter-in-law of Haifeng’s uncle’s second aunt’s family? ! I’m San Ma Zi’s mother!” ”

“Although it was a little far-fetched, and they didn’t even have the same relationship, old Mrs. Cen still remembered immediately. She smiled and said, “Oh, OH, oh! It’s You! San Ma Zi’s mother! Come in, come in!” ”
