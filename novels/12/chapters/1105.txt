“Chapter 1106: 243: face-smacking burning online, forcefully cleaning up the family! 2”

It made people shudder.

“”Miss Zhao, as the interim chief of the consortium, how did you manage the Shunxi consortium all these years? How did she get the position of vice-president when she could even get her own corporate culture wrong?” Ye Zhuo paused and swept his gaze across everyone’s faces, “My grandfather spent more than 20 years to establish the Shunxi Consortium! He didn’t ask you people who don’t know the gravity of the situation to come here and ruin the case!” ”

It was a very cold voice.

“It was as if it was dyed with a biting cold vision. It reverberated in everyone’s ears, making them not dare to look directly at it. ”

Destroy the wooden casket?

This sentence was obviously blaming Zhao Xueyin.

“Such a tall hat was directly placed on Zhao Xueyin’s head, making Zhao Xueyin somewhat unstable! ”

“All these years, she had been managing the Shunxi Consortium. ”

“Now, Sun Yiran had made such a low-level mistake.., ”

she originally had the attitude of watching a good show as she came to watch ye Zhuo and Sun Yiran fight with each other!

She did not expect that the fire would burn onto her head.

Even someone as experienced as Zhao Xueyin was at a loss when faced with such a sudden situation.

The air was very quiet.

It was so quiet that even the sound of a needle dropping to the ground could be heard. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

No one dared to make a sound.

Who would have thought that things would turn out this way?

“Zhao Xueyin tried her best to calm herself down. She turned to look at ye Zhuo and said, “Ye, Miss Ye, there’s been a misunderstanding.”If it was ten minutes ago, Zhao Xueyin would definitely not have stood up and said a single word. ”

“But now, it was different. ”

“Ye Zhuo had pointed out that she had ruined everything. If she did not stand up now, people would start talking about her. ”

“She was the temporary head of the Shunxi Financial Group, and she was the one who supported Sun Yiran. ”

“Right now, she and Sun Yiran were in the same boat. ”

Ye Zhuo hitting Sun Yiran’s face was like hitting her face!

Zhao Xueyin couldn’t back down now.

“She didn’t get to eat the pork, but she got into trouble instead! ”

“”Misunderstanding? What misunderstanding?”Ye Zhuo continued, “Could it be that the matter of Vice President Sun admitting that he was wrong about the corporate culture book was also a misunderstanding? Under the eyes of the public, could it be that you, Miss Zhao, want to protect her in public?” ”

Cover up in public!

“Every Word of Ye Zhuo’s turned into a sharp blade, and Zhao Xueyin almost couldn’t catch her breath. ”

“”Shunxi Financial Group is the territory my great-grandfather spent more than 20 years to conquer. Today, I’m going to clean up the organization on his behalf! I’m going to clean up the evil practices within the Financial Group!” ”

Clean up the organization.

As soon as he said that.

Everyone looked at each other and saw fear in each other’s eyes.

“Miss Ye!”Zhao Xueyin continued.

“Don’t worry.”Ye Zhuo looked back slightly and looked at Zhao Xueyin. “You can talk about your responsibility later.”

Zhao Xueyin choked and couldn’t say a word.

This feeling was very strange.

Ye Zhuo was clearly six or seven years younger than her.

“However, in front of Ye Zhuo, she felt an inexplicable pressure and almost didn’t dare to breathe loudly. ”

This terrifying feeling made Zhao Xueyin think of four words.

Bloodline suppression.

Ye Zhuo turned to look at Sun Yiran. “Go to the finance department to settle your salary. You Don’t have to come tomorrow.”

Don’t have to come?

Why didn’t he have to come?

Sun Yiran only reacted after a moment. Ye Zao wanted to remove her position.

Why?

She had relied on her own strength to become the vice president. What right did ye Zao have to remove her?

Sun Yiran’s face turned pale. She raised her head to look at Ye Zao. “What right do you have to stop me from coming? !”

“”Just because I’m Ye Zao.”Ye Zao’s voice was very soft and faint, but it was tinged with a biting aura that could not be resisted. No one dared to look at him directly. ”

“What if I don’t Leave!”Sun Yiran said.

“Ye Zao didn’t Answer Sun Yiran directly. He turned to the side and opened his red lips, “Captain Wu.” ”

Captain Wu’s real name was Wu Yong.

He was the security captain of the Shunxi Financial Group.

Wu Yong was the 25th Assassin on the International Kill Order.

“During an event, Wu Yong was seriously injured and saved by Zhao Xueyin by accident. ”

“In order to repay Zhao Xueyin for saving his life, Wu Yong stayed in Shunxi Financial Group and became the captain of the security team. ”

“Usually, Wu Yong only listened to Zhao Xueyin. ”

“As long as Zhao Xueyin didn’t say anything, Wu Yong wouldn’t listen to anyone’s orders. ”

“Even if the heavenly king came, it wouldn’t do. ”

“At this moment, he heard ye Zhuo call Captain Wu. ”

“Sun Yiran’s expression was full of ridicule. She crossed her arms over her chest and said, “Let’s see who dares to touch me today!” ”
