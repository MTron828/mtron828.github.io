“”Thank you, Lizi.” ”

“”What’s there to thank! We’re good friends after all! Oh right, we’re going to the battlefield tomorrow. Should we go eat something to celebrate tonight?” ”

“Ye Zhuo nodded. “Sure, let’s go to my place.” ”

“An Lizi said, “I won’t go to your place tonight. I’ll eat your food every day. I’ll have to change my taste occasionally. Let’s go eat at Qianji Barbecue, right? It’s my treat!” ”

“Although the ye family’s private dishes were very delicious, an Lizi was really embarrassed to eat there all the time and Ye Shu didn’t charge them for it. ”

“Zhao Pingting also felt that it made sense. “Right, right, right. Let’s Go Eat Barbecue. I haven’t eaten skewers in a long time.” ”

The three of them went to a roadside stall to eat barbecue.

“If they didn’t have to go to the Examination Hall Tomorrow, the three of them would have prepared to drink some wine. ”

“The three of them ate more than 300 yuan, and Zhao Pingting quietly paid for it. ”

“When an Lizi went to pay the bill, she realized that Zhao Pingting had quietly paid for it. “Pingting, we agreed that I would pay for it. Why did you pay for it?” ”

“Zhao pingting smiled and said, “You can just invite him back next time.” ”

“Then it’s settled!”An Lizi reached out and put her hand on Zhao Pingting’s shoulder.

The next day.

June 7th.

The first day of the National College Entrance Examination.

“Ye Sen, who always liked to sleep late, got up early for a rare occasion. ”

He got up at six in the morning.

“Normally, he wouldn’t get up until seven thirty. ”

“He thought he was the first one to get up, but ye Shu got up earlier than her. When he got up, Ye Shu was already cooking porridge in the kitchen. ”

“Why are you up so early today?”Ye Shu looked at Ye Sen curiously.

“Ye Sen said, “Isn’t Zhuozhuo’s exam today? If I don’t get up early, who will send her to the exam hall later? Oh right, sister, what time is the first exam in the morning?” ”

“”9-11:30,”ye Shu answered. ”

“”There are still three hours left. The exam hall is an hour away from our house. plus the traffic jam and traffic lights, we have to leave at 7 o’clock. I’ll go call Zhuozhuo to have breakfast now.” ”

“As soon as he said this, the sound of footsteps came from the living room. ”

Ye Sen turned around to take a look.

It was ye Zao who had come back from running.

“”F * CK, my niece! You actually went for a run?” ”

Ye Zao nodded. “I run every morning.”

“Actually, Ye Zao also liked to sleep in. ”

“Unfortunately, the host’s physical fitness was not very good. She was the kind of person who would pant after running two steps. ”

“Under her training, she was much better now. ” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Ye Shu brought the breakfast that was prepared to the table. “It’s almost time to eat. After eating, we’ll go to the exam room. We can’t delay the exam.” ”

The breakfast was well-matched.

“Mung bean porridge, milk, meat buns, fried dough sticks, and a pile of spicy and sour radishes. ”

“After eating, Ye Zao found out that Ye Shu and Ye Sen were going to send her to the exam room. Ye Zao refused with a smile, “Isn’t it just one exam? Mom, Uncle, you don’t have to make it so grand. If you delay work, I can go alone!” ”

“How can that be! What if you encounter some trouble on the way and delay the exam? The college entrance exam is a big event in life! Your mom and I have to send you there personally!”

Not taking the college entrance exam.

Not being able to get into university was the biggest regret in Ye Sen’s life.

That was why he placed more importance on ye Zao’s College Entrance Examination than anything else.

“Ye Shu nodded. “Your uncle is right. It’s fine if you go to school normally, but we have to send you over for the College Entrance Examination! By the way, have you brought all your things? You have to bring your admission ticket and Identity Card!” ”

“I’ve brought everything. Don’t worry.”Ye Zao waved the transparent pen bag in his hand.

“”It’s good that you’ve brought everything.”Ye Shu continued, “By the way, I heard that when you enter the exam room, there will be a metal detector. Zao Zao, you’d better not wear clothes with metal decorations.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded. “Then I’ll change my jeans later.”

“After eating, Ye Zao went back to his room and changed into a light blue long dress. ”

“It was a very simple and elegant color. There was a string of white flowers embroidered on the waist line, as if they were wrapped around her waist. As she walked, the white flowers fluttered in the wind. ”

It was very beautiful.

“Because she could not refuse ye Shu and Ye Sen, Ye Zhuo had to ask the two of them to send her to the exam hall. ”

The first day of the college entrance examination.

There were more cars on the road.

“It had originally been an hour’s journey, but it took an hour and a half to arrive. ”

“At the entrance of the exam hall and school, there were a bunch of parents who had come to send her off. ”
