Chapter 166: 087: tearing a mistress apart and getting a divorce! 2

She wanted to protect her mother and didn’t want to see her mother get hurt in any way.

“But you’re doing this.”Ye Zhuo looked at an Lizi with a serious expression. “You’re treating your mother as an outsider! Think about it from another perspective. If you were your mother and you knew the truth of the matter, wouldn’t you be very disappointed?”

“Lizi, don’t be silly! At a time like this, do you still want to protect your father? Do you want to Kill Your Mother?”Zhao Pingting stood up and said, “Ask your mother to divorce your father immediately! Such a scum should be kicked out of the house!”

Zhao Pingting was so angry that she was dumbfounded.

Perhaps she wasn’t the party involved, so she couldn’t empathize with an Lizi.

In any case, if she were an Lizi, she would definitely not hide it from Xia Xiaoman.

“Pingting is right, you don’t have to be unfaithful a hundred times! Your mother can only obtain true happiness if she divorces your father.”Ye Zhuo continued, “Don’t worry that your mother won’t be able to live on without your father! In this world, women don’t have to rely on men to obtain happiness!”

“Really, really?”An Lizi sniffled.

Ye Zao nodded and continued, “Lizi, what’s your impression of my mother?”

“Very good!”In an Lizi’s impression, ye Shu was a beautiful and generous woman.

“Then you should know that my mother is a single mother, right?”Ye Zao continued to ask.

An Lizi was stunned for a moment and then nodded.

To be honest, if ye Zhuo had not mentioned it, an Lizi would have almost forgotten about it. This was because she could not see the sadness of a single mother in Ye Shu.

......

Ye Zhuo patted an Lizi on the shoulder. “Lizi, I can tell that your mother is even stronger than my mother. After leaving your father, she will definitely have a better life than my mother!”

“Get a divorce immediately! This kind of SCUM is disgusting to look at!”Zhao Pingting said angrily.

Ye Zhuo continued, “Instead of letting your mother find out on her own, why don’t you tell her now and face it together with her! Let me ask you, do you want to choose a father who cheats, or do you want to win back a mother who loves you?”

“I choose my mother!”An Lizi answered without hesitation.

Ye Zhuo nodded, “Very good. According to Chinese law, one has to leave the house with nothing. Now, as long as we have enough evidence to prove that your father cheats, we can make him leave the house with nothing!”! Lizi, from now on, you have to learn to protect your mother. Don’t let her down!”

Hearing this, an Lizi was suddenly enlightened.

Ye Zao was right!

Compared to a mother who loved her, what was a father who cheated on her?

An Dongliang had already disappointed Xia Xiaoman!

Then, as her daughter, she could not disappoint her mother again!

She had to be strong!

She had to face this problem with her mother.

“I have a photo! A photo of them together!”An Lizi immediately took out her phone and showed the photo she took at the Ye family’s private restaurant.

“This woman doesn’t look good either! How did your father fall for her?”Zhao Pingting was speechless. “Her taste is really bad! If your mother was any younger, she would have been a dozen streets ahead of her!”

She originally thought that the mistress who seduced an Lizi’s father would definitely look like a vixen.

She did not expect that.

This person looked very ordinary.

Other than dressing fashionably, his facial features were not as good-looking as an Lizi’s mother’s.

If it was not for the fact that it was right in front of them, no one would believe that this was a mistress!

Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly. “It’s not enough just to have a photo. We still need to have proof of their cohabitation. Oh right, has your father ever spent money on her?”

An Lizi nodded. “Of course he has! My father has over 20,000 dollars in expenses every month. He probably spent it all on this woman!”

Ye Zhuo narrowed his eyes. “Then get his bill out!”

“How do I do that?”An Lizi frowned. “I don’t Have My Dad’s account password.”

Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly. “Then do you know your Dad’s account?”

“Yes.”An Lizi nodded.

Ye Zhuo picked up the milk tea. “It’s not convenient here. Let’s go to my house.”

“Why would I go to Your House?”An Lizi was stunned. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Ye Zao said, “Bring out your father’s bill.”

“Zao Zao, do you have a solution?”An Lizi was a little surprised.

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded.

Zhao Pingting put her arm around an Lizi’s shoulder. “Lizi, thank God you’ve been sitting at the same table as Zao Zao for so long. Don’t you know that Zao Zao is very powerful?”

The three of them came to the Ye family together.
