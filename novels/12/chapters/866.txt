Translator: 549690339

“”I’m so envious,”yin wei continued, “I’m the kind of person who will get fat if I drink plain water!” ”

Female celebrities were different from ordinary people.

“Female celebrities weighed 90 pounds. Because of the camera angle and the lighting, they could be shot at 100 pounds. ”

Those who weighed 100 pounds could be shot at 120-130 pounds.

“Therefore, everyone was extremely thin. ”

Some of the female celebrities weighed only 70 to 80 kilograms. They were so thin that even the ribs on their chests could be seen clearly.

“This was because as long as they were a little fat, it would affect their appearance on camera. ”

“After eating, the few of them chatted for a while before going back to sleep. ”

Ye Zhuo and Yin Wei stayed in the same room.

“After returning to the room, Yin Wei looked at Ye Zhuo. “Ye, let’s add on wechat?” ”

“Sure.”Ye Zao nodded slightly. “What’s your wechat account number?”

“Yin Wei took out her phone. “Yezi, let me scan you.” ”

Ye Zao took out his phone and pulled out the QR code.

Yin Wei scanned the QR code and added ye Zao as a friend.

Ye Zao clicked “Agree.”.

“Yin Wei continued, “Yezi, I took a lot of photos today. I’m sending them to you now.” ”

“”Alright, thank you.” ”

Yin Wei sent all the photos over.

There were more than 20 photos in total.

“Among them, there were a few photos of ye Zao driving a tractor. ”

There were also photos taken at the fish pond.

Green Lotus leaves and pink lotus flowers.

Ye Zao stood on the boat with the paddle on his hand. He had a smile on his face. Everything behind him had become nothingness because of her.

She was more beautiful than a flower.

“Ye Zao flipped through the photos one by one. “TSK, why do I Look So Good!” ”

“Yin Wei raised her head to look at Ye Zao, thinking that she had misheard. ”

“In her opinion, ye Zao should not be that narcissistic. ”

So.

She must have misheard.

“After admiring her glory world beauty, ye Zao selected a few good-looking photos and sent them to Cen Shaoqing. [ do they look good? ] ”

“Cen Shaoqing quickly replied, [ the most beautiful in the universe. ] ”

“After sending a message, CEN Shaoqing immediately sent another message. [ leader, are you deliberately not letting me sleep at night? ] ”

“Cen Shaoqing was already tossing and turning. When he suddenly saw ye Zao’s photos, his heart burned even more. ”

He was extremely uncomfortable.

Ye Zao curled her lips slightly. [ why can’t I Sleep? ]

[ because you’re so beautiful that I can’t sleep. ]

This person’s mouth was really getting more and more poor. Ye Zhuo laughed softly.

“Seeing her like this, Yin Wei asked curiously, “Ye, who are you chatting with?” ”

“”My boyfriend,”ye Zhuo answered. ”

Boyfriend?

“Yin Wei looked at Ye Zhuo with a face full of surprise. “Ye, you have a boyfriend?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

Ye Zhuo was so outstanding that Yin Wei really couldn’t think of how outstanding her boyfriend was!

“What does your boyfriend Do?”Yin Wei continued to ask.

“Ye Zhuo’s tone was indifferent. “He... sells robots.”The CEN Group developed AI, so it wasn’t a problem to put it that way. ”

Sell robots?

“Do you start your own business?”Yin Wei continued to ask.

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“”OH.”Yin Wei nodded and continued to say, “By the way, where are you from, Ye?” ”

“I grew up in Yun Jing and currently live in the capital. What About You?”

“Yin Wei replied, “I’m from Hui Zhou.” ”

“Ye Zhuo narrowed his eyes. “The mountains and streams around the city, and the white clouds and green hills are hard to come by. I heard that it’s a very beautiful and poetic place.” ”

Who wouldn’t like to hear praise of their hometown from others when they were traveling outside?

“Yin Wei smiled and nodded. “Yezi, you’re right. Our place has a picturesque scenery and a good climate. It’s especially suitable for traveling!” ”

Ye Zhuo turned around. “I’ll definitely go there when I have the chance.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“”You’re welcome to come over anytime,”Yin Wei continued. “I’ll fly back to be your tour guide no matter where I am.” ”

“Really?”

“Of course it’s true!”

The two girls chatted until midnight before going to bed.

“The next morning, when Yin Wei woke up, the quilt on ye Zao’s bed was already folded. ”

“Yin Wei woke up in a daze to change her clothes, brush her teeth, and wash her face. ”

“After washing up, she went out and heard ye Zao’s figure. “Wei Wei, come over and have breakfast.” ”

“Yin Wei walked over and said in surprise, “Yezi, when did you wake up?” ”

Ye Zao’s expression was indifferent. “Six o’clock in the morning.”

“”Six o’clock?”Yin Wei continued, “Why did you get up so early?” ”

“”I got up to run and made breakfast.”Ye Zao handed Yin Wei a cup of soy milk, “I didn’t know what you guys wanted to eat in the morning, so I made some porridge, boiled a few eggs, and then made some water-fried buns and mixed a cold dish.” ”
