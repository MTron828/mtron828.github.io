“At 8:30 am, Lin Ze arrived at Bai Jingshu’s residence. ”

Bai Jingshu had already freshened up and was looking at Lin Ze nervously. “Do you think uncle and Auntie will like me?”

“Haven’t you felt it the last time?”Lin Ze asked.

“Bai Jingshu continued, “The last time was the last time.”This time, she had changed from being a guest to being Lin Ze’s girlfriend. ”

“Although she had met Lin Ze’s parents and knew that Ye Shu and Lin Jincheng weren’t harsh parents, Bai Jingshu was still very nervous. ”

“What if uncle and Auntie don’t agree to us being together?”Bai Jingshu looked at Lin Ze.

“Lin Ze smiled and said, “They won’t.” ”

“Did you tell uncle and Auntie That Your Girlfriend Is Me?”Bai Jingshu asked.

Lin Ze shook his head. “Not yet. I want to give them a surprise.”

“”Don’t turn it into a shock,”Bai Jingshu said worriedly. ”

“It definitely won’t turn into a shock.”Lin Ze held Bai Jingshu’s hand. “You’re so good-looking and have a good temper. How can my parents not like you?”

“Bai Jingshu asked unconfidently, “Really?” ”

“”Of course.”Lin Ze helped Bai Jingshu tidy up her clothes and continued, “Let’s go. My mom called me just now to ask if I’m here.” ”

“Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded.

She followed Lin ze into the car and got into it. Bai Jingshu was still a little nervous.

“The closer the car was to the Lin residence, the more nervous Bai Jingshu became. She turned to look at Lin Ze. “Who’s at home today?” ”

“Lin Ze wanted to say that there weren’t many people, but he was afraid that Bai Jingshu wouldn’t be prepared. When she saw that there were so many people at home, he became even more nervous, he said, “My parents, grandma, Uncle, fourth uncle, and fourth aunt, as well as Zhuozhuo and her boyfriend.” ”

Lin Qingxuan and Xia Xiaoman lived in Beijing. They wouldn’t miss out on such an important event like Lin Ze bringing his girlfriend back.

“Xia Xiaoman smiled and said, “Searing has a boyfriend. Ah Ze has a girlfriend too. Now, only our Lizi is left!” ”

“Seeing that an Lizi had reached the age to fall in love, Xia Xiaoman was a little anxious. ”

“”Lizi’s fate hasn’t arrived yet. You Don’t have to be anxious,”ye Shu said with a smile. “To be honest, I didn’t expect our ah ze to bring his girlfriend back so quickly.” ”

“Lin Ze was the kind of child who was slow to warm up. He didn’t seem to be interested in anything. Usually, he wasn’t very popular with girls. Ye Shu had even made up her mind that Lin Ze wouldn’t find a partner even at the age of thirty, but she didn’t expect Lin Ze to give them such a surprise. ”

“You’re right. There’s no way to be anxious about this kind of thing.”

“At that moment, the originally quiet Lin Zhi suddenly started babbling and laughing at Ye Shu. ”

“Ye Shu reached out to shake Lin Zhi’s hand and teased, “Does our little zhizhi also want to find a girlfriend?” ”

“Xia Xiaoman followed up, “Zhizhi asked your auntie to introduce you to someone.” ”

“Little Lin Zhizhi couldn’t speak clearly. He could only say a few simple words. He didn’t know what a girlfriend meant, but he knew that it was definitely a good thing for the adults to laugh. He nodded and said, “Okay, okay...” ”

“Seeing him like this, Ye Shu was amused. “With this kid of yours, who knows how many little girls he will lie to when he grows up!” ” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Xia Xiaoman smiled and said, “No, no, our little Lin Zhi is very monogamous, right, Baby?” ”

“As she finished speaking, Xia Xiaoman seemed to have thought of something. She raised her head to look at ye Shu and continued, “Right, whose family is ah ze looking for that girl from? Did he have any dealings with our family before?” ”

“”Ah Ze didn’t say. That kid covered his mouth like he was hiding something. I didn’t hear a single word from him,”ye Shu said. ”

“Xia Xiaoman continued, “I didn’t expect Ah Ze to look like a straight man. I didn’t expect him to be so good at protecting his girlfriend! Did he tell burning?” ”

“”I guess burning knows about it, but they’re siblings. If Ah Ze doesn’t say it, then burning won’t be able to say a single word,”ye Shu said. ”

“Xia Xiaoman placed Xiao Lin on the ground and let him play by himself. Then, she said, “Don’t worry. Aren’t we going to see him today? We have to trust ah ZE’s judgment.” ”

“”Okay.”After saying that, Ye Shu looked at her watch. “It’s about ten o’clock. It’s about time. I’ll go outside and take a look.” ”

“I’ll go with you.”Xia Xiaoman followed ye Shu’s footsteps and turned around to call Lin Qingxuan. “Take a look at the baby.”
