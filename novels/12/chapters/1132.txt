“Hearing this, everyone looked at each other. ”

“Actually, what the woman in Pink said was quite reasonable. ”

“Ye Zhuo was deliberately mystifying inside, scaring them half to death, but in the end, nothing happened. It was indeed quite infuriating. ”

“Where’s Miss Ye? Let her come out and explain to us all!”

“A slightly chubby man crawled out from the gap in the elevator door and said breathlessly, “She’s still... still inside...” ”

Si lui hurriedly walked over and pulled him up. “Are You Alright?”

“I’m... I’m fine.”

“Then, a fair hand appeared on the ground, its fingers clasped tightly together. ”

It was a very beautiful hand.

“Its joints were distinct, and it was as white as jade. ”

“Before everyone could react, a figure jumped out from the elevator gap. ”

PA —

It landed easily.

It was a little cool.

“The Lady in Pink looked at Ye Zao, she said in a strange tone, “Yo, Our Savior is coming up! Savior, you scared us so badly in the elevator just now. You said it was too late. Can you explain to us why the elevator hasn’t Fallen Yet?” ”

Ye Zao patted the dust off his body.

It was as if he didn’t want to explain.

The Lady in Pink got even angrier. “Ye...”

“At this moment, the old man standing next to the lady in Pink suddenly looked at the elevator door in shock. He pointed at the elevator door with his finger, and his entire body was trembling. ”

His expression was even uglier than seeing a ghost.

Everyone looked in the direction of the elevator door in confusion.

They saw that the elevator that was originally parked there had now become empty.

There was nothing left.

Bang!

“A violent sound came from under their feet, and even the ground shook. ”

This was the sound of the elevator falling.

“In other words, if they had slowed down even a little, they would have been crushed into pieces. ”

At this moment.

No one could tell what expression they had on their faces.

“Wu...”

A young girl could not hold it in anymore. She lost control of her emotions and burst into tears.

The other people around were affected as well. Their eyes turned red one after another.

“If it was not for ye Zao, they would have turned into meat pies by now. ”

“”Miss Ye! Miss Ye! Thank you, Miss Ye!” ”

“Where’s Miss Ye?”

“Wasn’t she here just now?”

“When everyone went to look for ye Zao, Ye Zao’s figure had already disappeared from the air. ”

“Miss ye is really a good person!”

“”Miss Wang, you went too far just now! How can you say that about our Savior?” ”

“”You’re a villain yourself, so you think that Miss Ye is the same person as you! I think you’re jealous of Miss Ye! Jealous that Miss Ye is better than you!” ”

“”Wang Feiqian, you’re so disgusting!” ”

“For a moment, everyone pointed at the pink-dressed girl, Wang Feiqian. ”

“Wang Feiqian bit her lip unwillingly and wanted to retort, but those who could appear in the banquet hall were either rich or noble. She could not afford to offend any of them, so she could only tuck her tail between her legs and run away dejectedly. ”

The lawyer looked at everyone with a complicated look in his eyes.

It had to be said that ye Zao today made him see a completely different ye Zao.

At the same time.

Jiang Xiaoyu stood in the hall downstairs and waited for old Madam Jiang.

It was a little boring to wait for them.

Jiang Xiaoyu picked up her phone and started playing games.

“”Xiaoyu! Xiaoyu!”At this moment, her hand was suddenly grabbed by someone. ”

Jiang Xiaoyu looked down and saw that the person holding her hand was old madam Jiang.

“Old Madam Jiang’s face was full of tears, and Jiang Xiaoyu was shocked. “Grandma, what happened to you?” ”

“”Xiaoyu, Xiaoyu! I almost didn’t see you just now!”Old Madam Jiang hugged Jiang Xiaoyu. ”

“”What’s wrong, Grandma? Don’t worry, Tell Me!”Jiang Xiaoyu helped old madam Jiang to a chair beside her and sat down. ”

“Old Madam Jiang was the only old woman in the elevator. Her thoughts were quite clear, and she told Jiang Xiaoyu everything that happened in the elevator. ”

Jiang Xiaoyu was terrified when she heard that.

“After hearing that it was ye Zao who saved them, Jiang Xiaoyu’s expression changed. “Grandma, are you sure you’re talking about the descendant of the Ye family, ye Zao?” ”

“”Of course!”Old Madam Jiang nodded with certainty. “Other than this miss ye, who else could it be? Miss ye is so beautiful. I wouldn’t mistake her for someone else! It’s her!” ”

“With that, old madam Jiang grabbed Jiang Xiaoyu’s hand. “Xiaoyu, we can’t be ungrateful. We have to thank miss ye properly.” ”
