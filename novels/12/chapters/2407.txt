Translator: 549690339

“Currently, the exit of the defense system was closed. ”

“If the people of L continent wanted to enter again, they would have to go through a special entrance. Once they entered, they would never be able to get out again. ”

“”Don’t worry, even if you invite me here in the future, I Won’t come to this damn place again!”Susan said angrily. ”

“Irene said at the right time, “Mom, I think what Jerry said makes sense. Please calm down. If something really happens, it’ll be too late to regret.” ”

“”Don’t go back, I’ll go back alone.” ”

Susan had made up her mind. No one could stop her.

“Looking at their mother like this, the siblings were helpless. ” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Susan packed up the things downstairs and turned to go upstairs.

“Irene continued, “Jerry, can we really not go back now?” ”

“”We can’t go back,”Jerry continued, “You haven’t seen the strange beast with your own eyes. You Don’t know how terrifying it is.” ”

“Although it had been a few days ago, Jerry still remembered the look in the Strange Beast’s eyes. ”

“Irene narrowed her eyes. “But mom insists on going back. How about this? I’ll go back with her, and you stay here alone.” ”

Irene was really worried about letting Susan go back alone.

“No.”Jerry shook his head. “Neither you nor mom can go back!”

Irene frowned slightly. “But mom’s side...”

“Susan’s temper was very stubborn. She would never easily change her decision, especially now that Mario had used such a big move like the perpetual motion machine. ”

“In fact, Susan wasn’t the only one. Many of her relatives had already left for home. ”

“Jerry continued, “I have a plan for Mom. You Don’t have to worry.” ”

“Alright.”Irene nodded.

Jerry walked upstairs.

“Susan was packing up in the bedroom when she heard footsteps. Without turning her head, she said, “You don’t have to say anymore. I Won’t change my mind! I want to go back immediately!” ”

“”Mom, I really can’t go back!”Jerry continued, “Besides, without me to send you back, how are you going to go back?” ”

“”I’ve already contacted your uncle Joseph. He will come to pick me up,”Susan said without raising her head. ”

Mr. Joseph was Susan’s boyfriend. The two of them had been together for many years.

“Hearing that, Jerry frowned slightly. Joseph was a very wise person. He was very clear about the current situation. He did not expect that Joseph would actually make the decision to go back. ”

“When will uncle Joseph Come?”Jerry asked.

“Susan said, “This has nothing to do with you.” ”

“Jerry sighed and continued, “Since you insist on going back, I will respect your opinion. I can rest assured that you and uncle Joseph can go back together. At least the two of you can take care of each other.” ”

“Hearing this, Susan put down the things in her hands and looked up at Jerry. She asked doubtfully, “Do you really think so?” ”

“”Of course.”Jerry nodded. “No matter what, I will respect your opinion.” ”

“Susan said with satisfaction, “That’s good! Why Don’t you and Irene go back with us?” ”

Jerry shook his head. “We won’t go back with you. Let’s wait for the peace in L Continent.”

“That’s fine.”

“Jerry continued, “Are you thirsty? I’ll get you a glass of water.” ”

“After packing up for a long time, Susan was indeed a little thirsty. She nodded and said, “Go ahead.” ”

Jerry immediately trotted downstairs to get water for Irene.

“After a while, Jerry carried the glass upstairs. “Mom, drink some water.” ”

Susan was really a little thirsty. She took the glass and drank more than half of the water in one go.

“Jerry continued, “Then you pack your things first. I’ll go downstairs to see if uncle Joseph is here.” ”

“You go.”Susan nodded.

“Jerry glanced at Susan, then turned around and went downstairs. ”

“Susan continued to pack her things, but for some reason, as she was packing, Susan suddenly felt very sleepy. ”

She felt very dizzy.

She looked as if she could fall asleep at any time.

“Susan yawned and was about to go to the bathroom to wash her face to sober up when a strong wave of sleepiness swept over her. The next second, she fainted. ”

Bang!

She fell to the ground.

“Fortunately, the bedroom was covered with a thick wool carpet. Otherwise, a normal person would not be able to withstand such a fall. ”

“Mom!”

“Irene pushed the door open and came in. She saw this scene and immediately trotted over. “Mom, What’s Wrong?” ”

Susan’s eyes were closed and she didn’t react.
