Translator: 549690339

“I’m Going!”Xu Xiao threw her backpack on the sofa. “I’m so tired!”

“If it weren’t for the special circumstances, she really didn’t want to stay with Xu Chaonan. ”

“Xu Chaonan didn’t say anything to her, and he didn’t allow her to do anything. ”

He really treated her like her daughter!

“Her parents didn’t care much about her, and Xu Chaonan was just a dog who meddled in other people’s business. ”

Who the hell was Xu Chaonan?

“If Xu Chaonan was not rich, she would not have bothered with him. ”

“How’s Your Aunt Doing?”Xu Xiao’s mother looked at Xu Xiao.

Xu Xiao looked at the manicurist beside her.

“Xu Xiao’s mother said nonchalantly, “It’s fine. She’s one of us.” ”

“After hearing what Xu Xiao’s mother said, Xu Xiao said, “She’s still as busy as before. She hasn’t found a boyfriend at all. Don’t worry about it.”Xu Chaonan was thirty-nine years old this year. He had been hurt by love, he had been alone all these years. ”

“Really?”Mother Xu frowned slightly. “Did you ask her?”

Xu Xiao nodded.

“Mother Xu said, “How did you ask?” ”

“Xu Xiao said impatiently, “I asked her to find an uncle for me. She said that she doesn’t want to find an uncle for the time being. Let’s wait for fate to come first.” ”

Wait for Fate to come first?

“Hearing this, mother Xu frowned even more. ”

“”Then what she means is that if she doesn’t look for him now, she will look for him in the future!”Mother Xu suddenly sat up straight and pulled her hand away from the manicurist. “That won’t do!” ”

The manicurist was shocked. Mother Xu extended her hand to her again. “You continue.”

“The manicurist nodded, lowered his head, and applied nail polish on mother Xu again. ”

“Xu Xiao said, “The sky is going to rain, and mother is going to get married. Is this something that can’t be done just because you say so?” ”

“”You Child! You actually have the mood to make sarcastic remarks!”Mother Xu was in a very bad mood, “What we eat, wear, and use now, which of them are not your aunt’s? If your aunt gets married, the whole family of three will go to Hell!” ” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The reason why the Xu family could afford to live in a luxurious mansion and hire servants was all because of Xu Chaonan.

“Xu Chaonan was a strong woman who lived up to her name. Her assets were over 100 million. Once she married into a family, she would belong to another family! ”

What about the three of them?

“Therefore, Xu Chaonan absolutely could not get married! ”

It would be best if she could be a lady in the Xu family for the rest of her life.

“In this way, Xu Xiao could still inherit Xu Chaonan’s inheritance in the future. If Xu Chaonan got married, the Xu family’s assets would definitely be left to her children in the future. Xu Xiao could not even dream of having a single strand of hair. ”

This was not possible!

The Xu family’s property should belong to the Xu family. How could it be divided among outsiders?

“As long as she thought that someone would compete with Xu Xiao for the property in the future, mother Xu felt extremely uncomfortable. ”

She was already prepared for Xu Chaonan not to get married. Who would have thought that Xu Chaonan actually wanted to get married.

Why would a 39-year-old old lady still want to Get Married? Wasn’t it embarrassing?

“Hearing this, Xu Xiao frowned slightly. She had not thought of this. ”

“It was all Xu Changgui’s fault. They were clearly siblings of the same mother, but Xu Changgui only knew how to eat, drink, whine, and gamble. Not to mention half, even Xu Chaonan’s little finger could not compare to him. ”

“As long as Xu Changgui had some ability to manage the company, the Xu family would not have no days left after leaving Xu Chaonan! ”

“”Then what should we do?”Xu Xiao sighed. “Aunt is already so old. We can stop her for a while, but we can’t stop her for a lifetime.” ”

“Mother Xu Thought for a moment and then said, “Why don’t you give your step-in to your aunt?” ”

“Me?”Xu Xiao pointed at herself.

“Yes.”Mother Xu nodded. “Your aunt likes you so much. She will definitely be very happy to give your step-in to her.”

“”Then can my father agree?”After all, she was the only daughter in the family. ”

“Give you to your aunt. You are still a member of the Xu family. is he stupid? Does he not agree?”

“If Xu Xiao could successfully become Xu Chaonan’s daughter, Xu Chaonan would definitely not consider getting married! In that case, he would not have to worry about the family property. ”

“Xu Xiao shrugged. “I don’t care. As long as father doesn’t have any problems, it’s fine.” ”

“”When your dad comes back tonight, I’ll discuss it with him.”Mother Xu continued, “By the way, did you tell your aunt to come back tomorrow night for dinner?” ”

“I did.”Xu Xiao nodded.

“Mother Xu continued, “Then I’ll quickly contact your aunt Wang and Aunt Xu.” ”

“Why should I contact them?”Xu Xiao asked with some confusion.

“To invite them over as guests.”

“Of course, being a guest was not the most important issue. ”

The most important thing was that Wang Qiong and Xu Zhizhi were both divorced people.
