“Yang Jiao snorted. “Fine, fine, fine. You’re always the one with the right.””

“Xi Weiyue hugged Yang Jiao’s arm and smiled. “Mom, don’t worry. I promise, I’ll never let that crazy woman bring the secret into the soil!””

“Ever since ye Langhua went missing half a month ago, she had become a truly crazy woman.”

She no longer wanted the company.

She no longer wanted her career.

“She actually ran to the place where she went missing half a month ago, opened a private restaurant, and became a cook.”

“Therefore, behind her back, everyone called ye Langhua a crazy woman.”

Yang Jiao raised her head to look at Xi Weiyue. “Why? Do you have a way?”

Xi Weiyue nodded.

“Yang Jiao continued, “What Way? Tell mother about it.””

“Xi Weiyue’s lips curled up as a glimmer flashed past her eyes, “A method isn’t a good one, but I believe that as long as i persist, I can definitely get her to reveal that secret! Otherwise, wouldn’t all my efforts over the years be in vain?””

“In order to get ye Langhua to reveal that secret, Xi Weiyue had persisted for more than ten years.”

“From the age of seven, she had learned how to please ye Langhua.”

In order to please ye Langhua.

“She had even given up on her own interests and hobbies, and lived as another person.”

“Little Half Moon liked the lilies of the bell, and she also liked the lilies of the bell. Little Half Moon liked sweet things, and she also liked sweet things...”

Even her name was because of Little Half Moon.

Xi Weiyue was not willing to give up just like that.

“Seeing XI weiyue like this, Yang Jiao smiled and said, “MMM, I believe in you.””

Xi Weiyue was indeed very outstanding.

She was only twenty-three years old. She had already graduated from graduate school and had her own achievements in the financial world.

She was much more outstanding than most of the children of wealthy families.

“Therefore, Xi Weiyue had always been the pride in Yang Jiao’s heart.”

Xi Muwen turned to look at Yang Jiao. “Has doctor Li talked to you recently?”

“Yes.”Yang Jiao nodded.

Doctor Li was the doctor responsible for ye Langhua’s health.

“Ye Langhua’s health had not been very good all these years. Now that ye Langhua had suddenly changed, Xi Muwen was a little worried that ye Langhua was about to die.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Ye Langhua’s life was cheap. If she died, so be it.”

The most important thing was ye Langhua’s secret.

“If ye Langhua told that secret, who would care about her life and death?”

The crux of the problem now was that ye Langhua had been guarding that secret the whole time and refused to say a word.

What If ye Langhua really took that secret to the ground?

Yang Jiao shook her head. “Doctor Li didn’t say anything about her body recently.”

“”Then, what’s Going On?”Xi Muwen frowned and then turned to look at Xi Weiyue. “Weiyue, come and see her again in the second half of the night.””

Today was the New Year.

“It was also the time when ye Langhua’s mind was at its weakest. If someone came to comfort ye Langhua at this time, they would definitely make ye Langhua spill everything.”

“Okay.”Xi Weiyue nodded.

...

On the other side.

Ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing were still watching the fireworks at the back of the mountain.

“Cen Shaoqing had prepared a lot of fireworks. Other than the ones with subtitles, there were also other shapes.”

“The heavenly maiden scattered flowers, the Great Roc soared into the sky, the dove of peace, and the Dragon and Phoenix danced.”

“In the world that ye Zhuo had lived in in his previous life, because of the serious pollution of the environment, fireworks were no longer allowed to be produced. The smell of the new year had long since disappeared. This was the first time she had seen such real and beautiful fireworks.”

She could even smell the faint smell of gunpowder in her nostrils.

Cen Shaoqing looked at her with slightly lowered eyebrows. He reached out and gently brushed away the white snowflakes on her hair.

The snowflakes fell on her hair.

“On her neck, on her nose, and even on her bright red lips.”

Cen Shaoqing’s Adam’s apple moved slightly.

He had the urge to eat the snowflakes on her lips.

“”Sear Sear.”Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips opened slightly, and her low voice was a little hoarse.”

“Mm.”Ye Zao raised his eyes slightly.

“Cen Shaoqing lowered his head, and just like that, his thin lips pressed onto her red lips. His hot palm pressed against her slender waist, pulling her into his embrace.”

He was so strong.

It was as if he wanted to fuse her into his bones and blood.

At this moment.

“The sound of fireworks, the wind, and the sound of snow all turned into nothingness.”

Ye Zao was a little stunned.

“At this moment, her nose was filled with sandalwood, and there was a faint smell of tobacco.”

“The man who appeared gentle on the surface was like a giant beast that had been dormant for a long time. His thin lips were burning everywhere, attacking cities and seizing pools.”

“In the end, the snowflakes on his red lips were swallowed into someone’s stomach.”
