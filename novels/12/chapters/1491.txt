No one can challenge Huang Wei!

“At this moment, Ye Zhuo, who had been looking down at his phone, suddenly raised his head and met Jin Yuyan’s gaze.”

“Her gaze was clear to the bottom, as if she could see through people’s hearts and see through the darkest side of their hearts.”

They looked at each other and Jin Yuyan was stunned. She was a little flustered.

That feeling was as if she had done something wrong and was caught by someone.

Jin Yuyan did not expect ye Zao to have the guts to look at her.

“After a while, Jin Yuyan recovered and looked up at ye Zao again. However, ye Zao had already retracted his gaze and continued to look at his phone.”

It was as if that scene just now had never happened.

“Looking at ye Zao’s figure, Jin Yuyan pinched her fingers. It seemed that this ye Zao had to be eliminated!”

“Soon, the competition began.”

“As if everything had been calculated, the host announced the start of the shooting competition. Ye Zao led his troops to push away the last enemy crystal. Then, he turned off his phone and looked up at the stage.”

“There was some distance between the audience seats and the competition stage, but through the big screen on the stage, Bai Xiaosu’s figure could be clearly seen.”

“Bai Xiaosu was also trying hard to find ye Zao’s figure. Unfortunately, there were too many people in the audience seats and the distance was too far. Why did it look so densely packed? She could only roughly identify ye Zao’s seat based on the clothes ye Zao was wearing.”

“An hour later, the competition ended.”

“As expected, Bai Xiaosu won first place.”

“When the national anthem of China was played on the competition ground, Bai Xiaosu could not hold back his tears.”

Being in a foreign country and hearing the national anthem of their motherland was something that every Chinese people were proud of.

All the Chinese people present also stood up from their seats and cheered for Bai Xiaosu and China!

“After the competition ended, Bai Xiaosu took the gold medal and rushed to ye Zao’s side. He said in a hoarse voice, “Miss Ye, thank you!””

“”Silly Girl, you won the competition yourself. Why are you thanking me?”Ye Zao reached out and wiped Bai Xiaosu’s tears.”

“Bai Xiaosu looked at ye Zao, “Miss Ye, if it weren’t for your guidance, I wouldn’t have won this gold medal!””

“Ye Zao smiled, “The gold medal was earned with your hard work and sweat. It has nothing to do with me.””

“The master led the way, and cultivation depended on the individual.”

Bai Xiaosu was able to get the gold medal because of her own hard work.

“”It has something to do with me!”Bai Xiaosu continued, “Miss Ye, you may not know, but just now backstage, a Japanese contestant was found to have taken illegal drugs and was disqualified. Fortunately, I listened to you and did not touch the water there. Otherwise, the person who was disqualified would have been me!””

“Thinking of you, Bai Xiaosu felt a lingering fear.”

“Hearing this, Ye Zao narrowed his eyes.”

“She only reminded Bai Xiaosu, but she didn’t expect Jin Yuyan to really make a move.”

It seemed that Jin Yuyan was really determined to succeed.

Ye Zao raised his head and looked at Bai Xiaosu. “Be careful these few days. Jin Yuyan failed twice. She will definitely make other moves.”

“Okay.”Bai Xiaosu nodded seriously.

Ye Zhuo returned to the hotel at around six in the evening.

“After resting in the hotel for two hours, Ye Zhuo received a message from Carl. He left the hotel in a car and went to the address that he had arranged with Carl.”

This was the Chinese Street.

“At eight o’clock in the evening, it was a lively time. There were all kinds of food stalls on both sides of the road.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Carl sat in front of a barbecue shop and waved at ye Zhuo. “An!”

Ye Zao pressed down the hat on his head and jogged over.

“Is it her?”A scar-faced man turned to look at the woman who was sitting in front of him in gorgeous clothes.

The woman nodded.

The scar-faced man picked up the beer bottle in his hand and stood up. “Leave it to me!”
