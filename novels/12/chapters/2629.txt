Study Abroad?

“At a time like this, Li hang obviously wouldn’t choose to study abroad! ”

“”Mom, I want to stay in the country to develop,”Li Hang said. ”

“Hearing this, Zhou cuihua said in surprise, “Why?” ”

“For someone like Li Hang, as long as he went abroad and came back with a layer of gold, his status would immediately be different. ”

“Li Hang looked at Zhou Cuihua and said with a smile, “I want to accompany you and uncle Wang Well.” ”

Zhou Cuihua was especially gratified to hear that.

Her daughter had grown up and was sensible. She also knew that she had to accompany her.

“”Good child,”Zhou cuihua continued, “But I still feel that your future is more important than accompanying us.” ”

Li Hang was good-looking. Perhaps he could even find a duke or other aristocratic family overseas.

“At that time, Li Hang would be a true upper-class person. ”

“From the perspective of a mother, Zhou cuihua quite hoped that Li hang could study abroad. ”

“Li Hang looked at Zhou cuihua, the corners of his mouth full of sarcasm. ” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

She knew very well what Zhou Cuihua meant.

Zhou Cuihua wanted to take the opportunity to get her to go abroad and then have a son with Wang Zhengxuan.

Impossible!

She would never give Zhou cuihua such a chance.

She would never watch Zhou Cuihua and boss Wang give birth to a child.

“If they had a child, what would she be? ”

“”Mom, the most important thing for me now is to accompany you and uncle Wang,”Li Hang looked at Zhou Cuihua and said. ”

“Zhou cuihua smiled and said, “You silly child. To Mom, nothing is more important than your future.” ”

“Mother! I just want to accompany you!”Li hang hugged Zhou Cuihua’s arm and began to act coquettishly.

“Zhou cuihua smiled and said, “Good, good, good. Accompany me, accompany me. You Child!” ”

“”Thank you, mother,”Li Hang said. ”

“Zhou cuihua continued, “If your uncle Wang knew that you gave up the opportunity to go abroad to accompany him at home, he would definitely be very happy.” ”

“”Cuihua! Wait a moment!”At this moment, a female voice sounded in the air. ”

Zhou cuihua turned around and saw that it was none other than Sun Guixiang.

“Sister-in-law?”Zhou cuihua asked.

“Sun Guixiang looked at Zhou cuihua and said, “Cuihua, have you really thought it through?” ”

“”Sister-in-law, now that the boat has sailed, it’s useless for you to say anything to my brother.”Zhou cuihua continued, “There are many things in the past that I don’t want to bother with you guys anymore. Sister-in-law, in the future, we’ll go our separate ways. Don’t bother with US mother and daughter, and we won’t interfere with your life.” ”

“Sun guixiang continued, “Cuihua, you and old Zhou are blood-related siblings. It’s too hurtful for you to say that.” ”

“At this point, Sun Guixiang paused and said, “No matter what happens, brother and sister are brother and sister. Blood is thicker than water. We can’t separate our blood ties no matter how hard we try.” ”

“Actually, Sun Guixiang had her own selfish motives when she said that. ”

“Looking at Zhou cuihua, she seemed to have really found a wealthy businessman. After Zhou Cuihua married a wealthy businessman, she would have to support her family in the future. ”

“At this time, she obviously could not make things too awkward with Zhou Cuihua. ”

“”Does my brother treat me as his sister?”Zhou Cuihua looked at Sun Guixiang and continued, “Sister-in-law, you only came here with a straight face because you saw that I’m different from before?” ”

“Although Sun Guixiang felt uncomfortable, she still maintained a smile on her face. Zhou Cuihua’s words could not be offended. ”

“”Cuihua, a family is a family after all...” ”

“”When my brother said those words, did he think that we were a family?”Zhou cuihua asked. ”

“Sun guixiang continued, “Your brother has a bad temper. Moreover, he’s a man. He definitely doesn’t think as well as US women. Why are you being so calculative with your brother. Actually, your brother is such a person. Whatever he says or does, it’s for your own good. It’s just that his methods are wrong. Your Brother always tells me about what happened when you were young... “... “...” ”

“”What do you mean by telling me all this today?”Zhou cuihua continued, “Are you trying to play the Family Card with me? Do you think I will ever forgive you again? A person like you who will do anything to achieve his goal is really disgusting!” ”

“Zhou Cuihua’s words were very unpleasant. Without even thinking, she knew that Sun Guixiang must be very regretful now. She regretted not treating her well back then. ”

“Some things just happened. No matter what she did now, it was useless! ”

“Sun Guixiang still maintained her smiling face. “Cuihua, you...” ”

Zhou cuihua couldn’t be bothered with Sun Guixiang anymore. She grabbed Li Hang’s arm and turned around to leave.
