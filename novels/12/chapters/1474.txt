Chapter 1475: 313: I admit defeat wholeheartedly! 5

Translator: 549690339

“Ya Lei gulped, his face was full of disbelief. ”

“After a long while, ya lei finally reacted, he picked up the die GU and shook it vigorously. ”

Three Sixes.

It had to be three sixes.

“A moment later, ya lei placed the die Gu on the table and took the die Gu. ”

“Two sixes, one five. ”

He lost again!

“Two out of three wins, Ye Zhuo had won twice against ya lei, the remaining round was meaningless. ”

But Ya Lei was not convinced.

“Even if he lost, he had to defeat ye Zhuo in this last round! ”

“Again?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“We agreed on three rounds!”Ya Lei said.

“”Alright.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly, picked up the die Gu and shook it three times rhythmically, then placed it on the table and opened the die Gu. ”

“”Oh my God!”Carl screamed: “An, how did you do it?” ”

“The three dice were stacked together, forming a rectangular shape, and the points were all six! ”

“Seeing this scene, Yala’s blood flowed back, and all his strength seemed to be sucked away at this moment. He slumped on the chair like dead wood. ”

Terrifying.

It was too terrifying.

“After so many years, Yala finally experienced the feeling of meeting an opponent. ”

“”I, I admit defeat!”Yala said. ”

“Ye Zhuo pressed the brim of his hat, and his tone was still clear and shallow. “Mr. Yala, aren’t you going to check if there’s a problem with the dice?” ”

“No need to check.”Yala waved his hand. “It’s my fault for not being as good as you! It’s my fault for judging you!”

“Carl was a little speechless. “If you had recognized this problem earlier, you wouldn’t have had to go through so much trouble.” ”

Yala smiled bitterly.

He had always thought that there was no true God of gamblers in this world. He never expected to be taught a lesson by a little girl.

“After standing on the high ground for a long time, this was the first time Yala had experienced ‘losing’. ”

This feeling was really unbearable!

“Ye Zhuo picked up a tissue and slowly wiped his hands, “I still have something to do, so I’ll leave first. As for the shares, just look for Carl directly.” ”

“After saying that, Ye Zhuo looked at Carl. “Let’s go.” ”

Carl followed ye Zhuo’s footsteps.

“Alar looked at ye Zhuo’s back and said, “An, aren’t you afraid that I’ll go back on my word?”That was 50% of Ranito’s shares! ”

“Ye Zhuo said without turning his head, “I believe you.” ”

I believe you.

“It was clearly a very simple word, but it made alar freeze on the spot. ”

This made him think of his brothers who had gone through thick and thin together when he was young.

“Once, his brothers had also trusted him so much. ”

Unfortunately.

Things had changed a long time ago.

“Carl followed ye Zhuo out of Ranito gambling city. “An, you’re really amazing. Even Yala was defeated by you. By the way, aren’t you afraid that Yala won’t keep his word?”Yala was not a good person, what could he not do? ”

“Ye Zao curled his lips slightly. “Don’t worry, he’s not that kind of person.” ”

“Although Yaler was not a righteous person, he was not the kind of person who would go back on his words. ”

“How do you know?”Carl asked.

“Ye Zao continued, “Because I can see from his eyes that he was once a person with faith and passion.” ”

“You can even see that?”Carl could not believe it.

“Ye Zhuo smiled, “When you have experienced more, you will naturally understand.” ”

Experienced More?

She said it like she was someone who had experienced the vicissitudes of life.

Carl scratched his head. He was clearly a few years older than ye Zhuo.

He was already 28!

Ye Zhuo was only 20 years old!

The two of them had just walked out of Las Vegas when Smith’s elite team of ten men that was assigned to Ye Zhuo ran over. “Miss Ye! Mr. Carl!”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Carl is fine now. You guys should return to the team as well.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“”Yes, Miss Ye!” ”

“In fact, these ten people were a little unconvinced of ye Zhuo at first. It was not until ye Zhuo entered ranito alone and brought Carl out unscathed that they changed their opinion of Ye Zhuo. ”

This young girl was much more powerful than they appeared to be!

Carl looked at ye Zao curiously. “Who are they?”

“Ye Zao said, “The people that Miss Smith assigned to me.” ”

“Carl was stunned. “So, Miss Smith already knows about this?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

On the other side.

Selead branch.

“When Miss Smith heard that ye Zao had brought Carl out of Ranito casino intact, her face was full of disbelief. “Really?” ”

The captain nodded. “We saw Miss ye bring Mr. Carl back with our own eyes.”

“Then where are they?”Smith asked immediately.

“The captain continued, “They’re on the way. They should be arriving soon!” ”

Downstairs.

Polly had been fighting against L.

But L. was too powerful.

“Not only did he not have the ability to fight back, but he had even disabled the entire SELEAD branch’s system! ”

“Currently, not a single computer in Selead could be used. ”

Polly was very anxious. His forehead was covered with layer upon layer of cold sweat.

“Adar had been consoling him by the side. “Polly, don’t worry. Take your time. Isn’t it just an L. ? You can even restore his surveillance, and you can still defeat him! I believe in You!” ”

“Polly looked up at yardar, “Mr. Yardar, I, I, I may have to disappoint you. L is too powerful. Moreover, the virus is different from the recovery photos...” ”

“”It’s okay, it’s okay.”Yardar patted Polly’s shoulder, “You’re already very powerful if you can recover the surveillance photos that L hacked personally! I’ll explain it to the headquarters. At most, we’ll change all the systems!” ”

“”Change the systems! Mr. Adar, you make it sound so simple! If we really change the systems, then what about our confidential documents?”The deputy executive came down from upstairs, “The surveillance footage that L hacked was originally recovered by Miss Ye! You insisted on taking credit for Polly! Now what? You’re embarrassing yourself! If you don’t have a diamond in the rough, then don’t take on this porcelain job!” ”

“”Mr. Deputy Executive Officer, do you know what you’re saying?”Adar furrowed his brows tightly. “Boli can at least contend against L for so long! If it was that Chinese person, he would have been scared to tears long ago!” ”

The deputy executive officer snorted coldly. “I’m very clear about what I’m saying! There are some people who have never seen their own weight! Shamelessly taking credit for others!”

“”Since you think your miss ye is so powerful, then let her come! I think your Miss Ye can’t even protect herself now!” ”

Yadar already knew that ye Zao went to Ranito Casino with only ten people to find Yadar.

Who Was Yadar?

Someone like ye Zao was just courting death?

“Stop arguing!”Smith came down from upstairs.

“Adar looked at Smith. “Miss Smith, you heard what the Deputy Executive Officer said just now. Please punish him severely!” ”

“”You shut up too!”Smith looked at the door and smiled. “Miss Ye, you’re back!” ”

Adar looked at the door.

When he saw that.

He was immediately stunned!

“He saw that not only did ye Zao come back, but he also brought Carl back. ”

“”Carl, it’s great to see that you’re okay!”Miss Smith walked to the side of the two people. ”

“After saying that, Smith bowed to ye Zao again. “Miss Ye, thank you!” ”

“”Carl and I are friends to begin with. Miss Smith, you don’t have to be so polite.” ”

Adar rubbed his eyes and believed that it was not fake.

Ye Zhuo really brought Carl back!

“Smith continued, “Miss Ye, I have one more thing to ask of you!” ”
