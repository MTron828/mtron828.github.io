“Surrounded by beautiful women, Xiao Baibai was naturally very happy, and very cooperative with the two of them to shoot a video. ”

At the same time.

Noisy streets all over China.

The big screen was full of the same words —

Chinese scientific research group’s wish: Wish Miss Ye and Mr. Cen grow old together.

Oil painting industry’s wish: Wish Miss Ye and Mr. Cen grow old together.

Calligraphy: Wish Miss Ye and Mr. Cen a long life together.

The same words are displayed on the most luxurious electronic screens on the streets of every country in the world.

International Scientific Research: Wish Miss Ye and Mr. Cen a long life together.

There is also a line of English below:

“Wish, Miss, Ye, and,. Cen, a, long, life, together. ”

Putting Chinese at the front and English at the back is really very attentive.

This also showed the status of ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing in the international medical community.

The international medical community wishes: ...

The NR Alliance wishes: ...

The Hacker Alliance wishes: ...

This proposal shocked ye Zhuo and the whole world.

“Old Mrs. Cen was sitting on the sofa and watching a small video when she suddenly stood up and cried out, “Oh my God! Oh My God! Oh My God! Am I Blind?” ”

“Zhou Xiang was putting on a face mask in the room when she heard Old Mrs. Cen’s voice. She couldn’t even put on a face mask anymore. She leaned on the railing on the second floor and looked at Old Mrs. Cen downstairs. She asked, “Mom, What’s Wrong?” ”

“Zhou Xiang’s voice pulled old Mrs. Cen back to reality. “Xiang Xiang, come down quickly! Come Down and take a look!” ”

“What’s Wrong?”Zhou Xiang immediately walked down.

“Old Madam Cen handed the phone to Zhou Xiang. “Xiang Xiang, tell me quickly. My eyes aren’t blind. I’m not daydreaming!” ”

Zhou Xiang looked at the contents of the phone and was stunned.

This...

This is real?

“At the same time, Zhou Xiang’s phone rang. ”

Zhou Xiang picked up the phone. It was a video from CEN Yuying.

“Zhou Xiang picked up the video. “Big Girl, What’s Wrong?” ”

“In the video call, Cen Yuying said a little excitedly, “Mom, have you seen the news?” ”

“”I, I just saw it!” ”

“CEN yuying said excitedly, “Fifth lass is doing well! Looks like mom, you’re going to be a nurse...” ”

Cen Yuying did not finish her sentence before the call ended.

A call came in.

It was CEN yueying calling.

“Zhou Xiang picked up the call. “Hello, Third Lass.” ”

“Cen Yueying’s voice was equally excited. “Mommy, Mommy! Did fifth lass propose?” ”

“”Yes, I just saw the news too!” ”

“”Mom, Congratulations!” ”

“Before the call ended, the door was pushed open, followed by the sound of footsteps. ”

“Cen Yueya ran over, out of breath. “Mom! Grandma!” ”

“Yueya?”Zhou Xiang looked at Cen Yueya.

“Because they had been running all the way here, Cen Yueya’s face was very red. She panted and said, “Mom, Grandma, is, is it...” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Second girl! I know why you’re here! Are you here to congratulate me on having a great-grandson soon?” ”

“”Yes, yes, yes!”Cen Yueya immediately nodded and finished her sentence in one breath. “Grandma, fifth girl has done a great job this time!” ”

And it was done very beautifully!

Old Mrs. Cen nodded and smiled. “I agree with what you said!”

“She did not expect Cen Shaoqing to look so nonchalant. He even said that he was not in a hurry to propose. Now that he had really managed it, he was more ostentatious than anyone else. ”

As expected of her great grandson.

“After saying this, old Mrs. Cen fell into deep thought. ”

“CEN Yueya continued, “Grandma, what are you thinking about?” ” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Old Mrs. Cen said, “I’m thinking of a name for my future Great-grandson!” ”

“Cen Yueya narrowed her eyes. “Oh, Grandma, You Value Boys over girls! What if they give birth to a girl?” ”

“”So what if it’s a girl? I Can’t wait to be a little girl! Giving birth to a girl is like burning!”Old Mrs. Cen said, “Can’t a girl be my great-grandson?” ”
