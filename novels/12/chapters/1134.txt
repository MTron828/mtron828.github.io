“Go ahead.”Auntie Wang looked at Ma Jianyue.

“Ma jianyue continued, “This prescription was given to us by the President of the Shunxi Consortium, Ye Zhuo. You wanted to take it and eat it yourself. If anything happens after you eat it, you’ll have to pay for it. You Can’t throw dirty water on us!” ”

“Auntie Wang nodded, “Don’t worry, Madam. I know this point.” ”

“”As long as it’s clear.”Ma Jianyue continued, “You can leave first.” ”

Auntie Wang turned around and walked out.

“After Auntie Wang left.., granny Zhou said with some worry, “Jianyue, is there something wrong with that prescription? Why did you say that all of a sudden? If there’s a problem, we can’t let Auntie Wang take it back! What if it really eats people up?” ”

“Ma jiayue smiled and said, “There’s nothing wrong with the prescription, but mom, you should have heard of this saying! Every medicine has a third of its poison! What if Auntie Wang’s husband is unlucky and eats something bad? I said that to prevent any future trouble!” ”

No problem?

No problem at all!

All living things in the world mutually reinforce and counter each other.

“The two medicinal herbs in the prescription given by ye Zhuo were not only useless, but also counter to one of the medicinal herbs in it! ”

“If ye Zao dared to use such a fake prescription to deceive others, he would be waiting to receive the court’s Flyer! ”

“At the thought of this, Ma Jia Yue felt very happy. ”

“If this person was lucky, even the heavens would help him! ”

She did not expect that she would be able to help Zhao Xueyin so much just by staying at home.

“When she heard Ma Jia Yue say that the prescription was fine, Granny Zhou heaved a sigh of relief. “It’s good that it’s fine!” ”

In the banquet hall.

“After ye Zhuo and elder Zhang sent everyone back, they drove back to the Ye residence. ”

In the car.

“Little White said anxiously, “Great Burning, can you hurry up?” ”

“Why are you in such a hurry?”Ye Zhuo looked back.

“Little White said, “I’m running out of electricity!” ”

“Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly, stepped on the accelerator, and sped up. ”

The sudden acceleration made little white lean backward.

“Little White sat down and complained, “Big Zao! Why didn’t you tell me that you were suddenly speeding up! You scared me to death!” ”

“Ye Zao held the steering wheel with both hands. “Didn’t you run out of battery? If you run out of battery, why didn’t you turn on the Power Saver Mode?” ”

“”Right!”Little White finally remembered that it was running out of battery. “I’m going to turn on the power saver, the power saver...”before it could finish its sentence, little white stopped talking. ”

“Meow!”Brother Meow immediately crawled out of Whitey’s pocket and used his claws to slap Whitey’s face without any restraint.

He shouted as he slapped.

“It happened to be a red light in front of them. Ye Zao stepped on the brakes and held the steering wheel with one hand while grabbing brother Meow with the other. “Alright, Whitey is fine. It’s just that the battery is out.” ”

Brother Meow seemed to have understood what ye Zao said. He found a comfortable place to snuggle in ye Zao’s arms and immediately stopped barking.

“Twenty minutes later, the car stopped in front of the mansion. ”

Ye Zao opened the door and got out of the car. He turned on Whitey’s spare battery at the same time.

Di —

The screen above Whitey’s head instantly lit up. “Big Zao!”

Ye Zao’s tone was clear and shallow. “I’ve turned on the spare battery for you. Cut the crap and go home quickly to charge it.” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Got it!”Whitey jumped out of the car.

Brother Meow also jumped into Xiaobai’s pocket at this time.

“Miss Ye!”

“At this moment, a female voice suddenly came from behind. ”

Ye Zao looked back slightly and saw that it was Jiang Xiaoyu.

“Seeing ye Zao again, Jiang Xiaoyu’s face was full of guilt, “Miss Ye, my name is Jiang Xiaoyu! “I’m sorry, I may have misunderstood you. I think you’re a bad girl who steals other people’s things. That’s why I treated you like that in the banquet hall. Please forgive me, I really didn’t do it on purpose!” Jiang Xiaoyu bowed to ye Zao. ”

“Ye Zao stood in front of Jiang Xiaoyu and said calmly, “If I’m not wrong, you called me out at the banquet tonight to avenge Zhao Xueyin, right?” ”

Jiang Xiaoyu was stunned.

She didn’t mention Zhao Xueyin at all because she was afraid that ye Zao would hold a grudge against Zhao Xueyin.

Then how did ye Zao Know About It?

Ye Zhuo curled his lips slightly. “I’m curious how I Know?”

Jiang Xiaoyu nodded.

“”Because you’re a chess piece in Zhao Xueyin’s hands,”ye Zhuo continued, “Help me tell Zhao Xueyin to face her head-on if she has the guts. Don’t use those shady tricks behind her back.” ”

Chess piece?

Ye Zhuo said that she was a chess piece in ye Zhuo’s hands.

Was this chess piece what she imagined it to be?
