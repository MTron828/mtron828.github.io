Chapter 75: 072: a slap in the face! In the burning business empire, Lin Sha recognized the scumbag and had an abortion

Lin Sha nodded.

After Lin Sha left, Ye Zhuo went to the fridge to get a bucket of instant noodles. He skillfully made the instant noodles, then picked up a sketch pen and leaned against the window, drawing while waiting for the instant noodles to be ready.

After a while, the frame of a gown appeared on the white paper.

That’s right.

Ye Zao was designing an evening gown.

Melody’s anniversary party was in two months. By then, the temperature in the capital would be below zero degrees Celsius, which was very cold. She wanted to design an adjustable temperature gown at this time.

By then, she would not be afraid of the cold.

At the same time, she would also be able to advertise the adjustable temperature gown.

She would save a sum of money for publicity.

The people who could attend the wonderful sound party were definitely female celebrities and female anchors. This kind of people needed to walk the red carpet all year round. They needed clothes with adjustable temperatures more than ordinary people.

After all, they needed to walk the red carpet outdoors regardless of the season.

Summer was not a big deal. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Once autumn and winter arrived, they would face a severe test.

Most importantly, the audience for clothes with adjustable temperatures were not only female celebrities, but also male celebrities and ordinary people.

After all, there were no restrictions on its style.

It could be designed as a formal dress, and it could also be designed as a suit, t-shirt, formal dress...

Three minutes later, a perfect design for a formal dress appeared on the blueprint.

The entire blueprint looked full of a high-class feeling.

Even professional designers would be ashamed when they saw it. If they did not see it with their own eyes, no one would believe that this was a work that only had three minutes.

Ye Zhuo signed a capital Z at the bottom.

After eating the instant noodles, ye Zhuo went back to her room and began the live broadcast.

This was her first live broadcast after the ‘cheating’and ‘the second magnificent Tang princess’incident.

As soon as she opened the live broadcast room, the audience had already exceeded 200,000.

[ ye, will you really attend Miao Yin’s anniversary party on time? ]

[ ye, I’m so looking forward to seeing you in person. ]

[ congratulations, Ye, for raising 20 million fans. ]

Looking at this bullet screen, ye Zao realized that his fan base had increased from 3 million to 20 million.

“Don’t worry, I never lie. I’ll definitely be there on time for the third anniversary gala.”

[ Ah Ah Ah! I’m so excited! Ye, you must be very beautiful. ]

Ye Zao said humbly, “Just So-so, third in the world.”

[ the streamer is obviously an ugly freak, yet she still refuses to admit it. She has already recorded the video and left a certificate. She’s just waiting to be slapped in the face! ]

[ cheating dog is embarrassing! ]

[ if you’re really that beautiful, is there a need to cover it up like this? ]

[ Our Rong Rong is the most beautiful! ]

“I don’t want to explain the matter of cheating a second time. A clean slate is a clean slate. As for the specific situation, everyone can pay attention to the results of the PK between me and Miss Rong at the Miao Yin Third Anniversary Party!”

[ Yezi is so tough! I support you! ]

[ Yezi, we will always support you! ]

[ those who are deliberately trying to cause trouble, please stop. Yezi said that she would attend Miao Yin’s third anniversary party. Don’t You Have Eyes? ]

Right at this time, a challenge was received on the computer.

[ the laid-back scholar has issued a challenge to you. Do you accept? ]

Ye Zhuo slightly raised his eyebrows. “This person is really unyielding.”

[ this person won’t give up until he reaches the Yellow River. ]

[ actually, this person’s chess skills are also very good. It’s a pity that he met our father, leaf. ]

Ye Zhuo clicked accept.

From the moment the game started, Cen Shaoqing had been paying attention to the situation on the chessboard at all times.

He had to think for a few minutes before placing a stone. Only after he was sure that there was no problem did he dare to place a stone.

But even so.

He still walked step by step into the trap set by this person.

High!

It was too high!

Although he had lost a few rounds in a row, CEN Shaoqing was not discouraged at all. He still enjoyed it.

In ancient times, there was a time when Bo Ya met his son. When the mountains flowed, a bosom friend was found.

If it was possible, he really wanted to meet this sitara and have a toast.

From this person’s playing style.

He was definitely a wonderful person!

At this moment, there was a knock on the door. “Is fifth brother here?”

“Come in.”Cen Shaoqing casually grabbed the Buddhist beads on the table and lazily leaned against the back of the chair, closing his eyes to rest.

Li Qiandong pushed the door open and came in. “Fifth brother, there’s a document here that needs you to sign.”

Cen Shaoqing signed his name on the document.

It was a very graceful three words.

It carried a strong sense of abstinence.

For some reason, it made Li Qiandong think of ye Zhuo.

Actually, Ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing were quite compatible.
