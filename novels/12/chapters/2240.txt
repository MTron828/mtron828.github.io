“Looking at the book in front of her, Bai Jingshu tactfully refused, “Since Mr. Chen also likes to study the ancient culture on Earth, how can I take away his interest. ”

“No Merit, no reward. ”

“Previously, Chen Yaosheng had expressed his feelings in front of her many times. If she accepted Chen Yaosheng’s favorite thing at this time, it would be hard to say. ”

Some people and some things still needed to draw a clear line.

“When she finished speaking, Bai Jingshu paused for a moment before continuing, “I appreciate Mr. Chen’s feelings.” ”

“Chen Yaosheng looked at Bai Jingshu and did not have his usual glib tone, he said very seriously, “Although I like the ancient culture on Earth, my understanding is not as thorough as Miss Bai’s. A treasured sword is given to a hero and articles are given to a sage. “Miss Bai, you are more suitable to have this book than I am. Don’t worry, I don’t have any other intentions.” ”

“Bai Jingshu maintained her smile and continued, “Mr. Chen, I really can’t accept such a valuable thing.” ”

The Yuan dynasty record was already out of print.

“Moreover, from the words recorded by Chen Yaosheng, it could be seen that he was also a person who loved ancient culture very much. ”

“Most importantly, Chen Yaosheng’s understanding of Earth’s ancient culture was no less than hers. ”

What Chen Yaosheng said was just modesty.

“Seeing Bai Jingshu like this, Chen Yaosheng directly put the book on the ground, “Miss Bai, if you don’t believe me, I can leave immediately. I just want to make this book more valuable. At the same time, I also believe that Miss Bai will definitely let more people know about Earth’s ancient culture.” ”

“After saying that, he turned around and left. He did not give Bai Jingshu the chance to refuse. ”

“Mr. Chen!”

Chen Yaosheng did not stop. His figure quickly disappeared into the crowd.

“Looking at the book on the ground, Bai Jingshu bent down to pick it up. ”

It seemed that she had to find an opportunity to return the book to Chen Yaosheng.

“After turning around, a faint smile appeared on Chen Yaosheng’s face. ”

This was only the beginning.

“After understanding Bai Jingshu’s preferences, he would definitely be able to conquer her in a short period of time. ”

“He would completely conquer Bai Jingshu, this beautiful flower on a high mountain! ”

“When he thought of the future, the smile on Chen Yaosheng’s face became even more obvious. ”

He was looking forward to Bai Jingshu being conquered by him. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The scene would definitely be spectacular.

“Bai Jingshu flipped through the book. That’s right, it was the Yuan dynasty record that she had just borrowed. ”

The handwriting on the post-it note was exactly the same.

It was said that one’s handwriting was like a person’s.

“Before this, Bai Jingshu had never known that Chen Yaosheng’s handwriting was so beautiful. ”

“She had always thought that in the s galaxy, other than her, there were no other otherworldlings who loved Earth’s ancient culture. ”

She did not expect that she was not the only one.

“Suddenly, she felt a little happy. It was as if Zi Qi, who no one could understand, had finally met Zi Ya. ”

This feeling was a little strange.

She seemed to have gotten to know Chen Yaosheng again.

Bai Jingshu carefully put the book into her bag.

“”Miss Bai!”At this moment, a figure ran toward Bai Jingshu not far away. ”

Bai Jingshu was stunned for a moment before she reacted. “Miss Shi.”

“”What a coincidence,”Shi Qingcheng said breathlessly. “Miss Bai is here to study Earth’s ancient culture again.” ”

“”Miss Shi, you must be joking. I’m just here to have some fun. I’m not really here to study it.”Compared to scholars who truly studied ancient culture, she was still far from it. ”

“Shi Qingcheng continued, “Miss Bai, you don’t have to be so polite. You Can Just Call Me Qingcheng. It’s rare to meet people from the same race on Earth. Everyone, please be more casual.” ”

“It was obvious that Shi Qingcheng was also a person of character. Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “Then, Shi Xiao, Qingcheng, you can also call me by my name.” ”

“”Jingshu!”Shi Qingcheng smiled and said, “Oh right, I’ll introduce you to a good friend.” ”

“Who?”Bai Jingshu was stunned.

“Come with me.”Shi Qingcheng held Bai Jingshu’s wrist. “Let’s go over there.”

Bai Jingshu followed Shi Qingcheng’s footsteps.

“She saw a slender figure standing in front of a stall selling candy paintings. “Boss, give me a Monkey King. And this Nezha isn’t bad either.” ”

Her voice was pleasant to hear.

“Just by looking at her back, Bai Jingshu could tell that this girl was not an ordinary person. ”

“”Zha Zha,”Shi Qingcheng called out. ”

“Ye Sear looked back slightly. “Qingcheng, where did you go just now? Tanghua, do you want one?”Speaking up to this point, Ye Sear realized that Bai Jingshu was standing beside Shi Qingcheng. He smiled and said, “This beauty is?” ”
