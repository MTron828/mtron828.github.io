“Ye Shu continued, “That day, I went to Shaoqing’s house to play mahjong, and I Saw Your Aunt Xiang hiding in the bathroom crying.” ”

The Cen family was harmonious.

Old Lady Cen was also a good mother-in-law.

“All the problems in Zhou Xiang’s family had been resolved, so it shouldn’t be a family conflict. ”

“But if it wasn’t a family conflict, then what was the reason? ”

This made ye Shu a little puzzled.

“Crying?”Ye Zhuo frowned slightly.

“”Yes.”Zhou Xiang nodded. “She acted as if nothing had happened, so I didn’t point it out.” ”

“Could it be because of that matter?”Ye Zhuo’s beautiful eyes narrowed slightly.

“What matter?”Ye Shu asked curiously.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Mom, you should know how uncle left, right?” ”

“You Mean Shaoqing’s father?”Zhou Xiang asked.

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded.

“Zhou Xiang thought for a moment and then said, “If I remember correctly, the boat should be difficult to leave.” ”

This matter was not a secret in the CEN family.

“Ye Zao also said in a low voice, “Now I suspect that uncle is not dead at all. Moreover, he might have married and settled down somewhere else.” ”

“What?”Ye Shu said in surprise.

“Ye Zhuo raised his index finger in front of his lips and made a gesture of ‘silence’. Then, he said, “At the moment, it is only my guess. I Can’t be sure whether it is true or not.” ”

“”Then you can’t Let Your Aunt Xiang know,”ye Shu said. ”

“If Zhou Xiang knew about this matter that had not been confirmed, it would only make her more sad. ”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “I know that. I’m just worried that Aunt Xiang might have discovered something!”

“Ye Shu frowned slightly. “If Shaoqing’s father is really still alive, then what about your Aunt Xiang?” ”

Then wouldn’t Zhou Xiang’s years of waiting become a joke?

Ye Zhuo didn’t say anything.

“She didn’t know the truth of the matter, so she naturally didn’t have the right to speak. ”

“Then does young master know about this matter?”Ye Shu asked.

“”Yes,”ye Zhuo continued, “He’s currently investigating.” ”

Zhou Xiang sighed. “It’s also difficult for that child.”

“Actually, Cen Shaoqing’s journey had not been easy either. ”

“After Cen Haifeng’s accident back then, the Cen family was old and young, with only a room full of women left. If Cen Shaoqing had not stepped forward, how could the CEN family be what it was now? ”

If Cen Haifeng was really still alive...

Then he was not a good son.

Nor was he a good husband.

And he was not a good father!

“What are you two talking about?”Lin Jincheng walked over with food in his hands. “Are you hungry? Dinner will be ready in a while. You want to eat some snacks to fill your stomach.”

Ye Zhuo was about to reach out to take the snacks when ye Shu slapped away the snacks in his hands.

“”Zao Zao! You Can’t eat dessert anymore!”After saying that, she looked at Lin Jincheng. “You know that children can’t eat too much sweet food, yet you still give this to her! After eating this, are you going to have dinner or not?” ”

“Lin Jincheng said, “Isn’t this what Zao likes to Eat?” ”

“”If she likes to eat it, then you let her eat it? Don’t you know that eating this thing is not good for your body?”Ye Shu had been obsessed with maintaining her health recently. She had read a lot of books and attended a lot of classes, so she strictly forbade ye Zao from eating dessert again. ”

“After all, eating too many desserts would lead to obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, and other diseases. ”

“Ye Zao said seriously, “Mom, I’m different from them. They will get diabetes and high blood pressure if they eat it, but I won’t.” ”

“Different? How is it different? Look at your small body. Do you have one more arm than others? Or one more leg?”Ye Shu asked back.

Ye Zhuo:”...”

“Ye Shu continued, “From now on, you can only eat three desserts a day. Today’s three desserts have already been eaten, so you can’t move any of these.” ”

“Upon hearing this, Yi Ling flew out of the house and said excitedly, “Wow! Then why are there so many desserts? Won’t they all benefit me!” ”

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “Take them and eat.” ”

“Yi Ling said excitedly, “Thank you, Mommy. Mommy Is So Nice!” ”

Ye Shu could not help but laugh. “If Only Yi Ling could turn into a human.”

“If Yi Ling could turn into a human, she would not have to worry about no one taking over the Lin family business. ”

“Yi Ling stuffed all the desserts into her chest pocket and flew into the house. She stood in front of Whitey and showed off. “Look, Mommy gave this to me! Mommy gave this to me too! Aren’t you very envious?” ” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Whitey snorted, “Childish! She is the most powerful, the most adorable, and the most intelligent robot in the entire universe. She won’t bother with you!” ”
