Translator: 549690339

“Whatever ye Zao could do, she could do it too! ”

What was ye Zao?

“Given time, she would definitely be more than ten times more dazzling than ye Zao. ”

“Thinking of this, man Xing narrowed his eyes. His eyes were filled with a vicious light. ”

Du Du du —

“At this moment, there was the sound of knocking on the door. ”

Man Xing came back to his senses and brushed the hair on his forehead behind his ears. “Come in.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“A moment later, master Cao walked in from outside the door. ”

“Master.”Man Xing stood up.

“Master Cao nodded and said, “Zhao Shan Dong is here.” ”

“Please let him in.”

“Okay.”

“Soon, Zhao Shan Dong walked in from outside the door. ”

“Although it had only been two or three days, Zhao Shan Dong seemed to have aged more than ten years under the mental pressure. He looked especially Haggard. ”

“When he saw man Xing, Zhao Shan Dong dared to believe that the news he had heard was true. His eyes instantly lit up. “Miss Man Xing!” ”

“”Chairman Zhao,”man Xing said. ”

“Zhao Shan Dong was so happy that he was about to cry. “Miss Man Xing, it’s great to see you! Don’t worry, I didn’t say anything!” ”

“If man Xing still didn’t find him, he wouldn’t be able to hold on any longer. ”

Fortunately.

“Fortunately, man Xing was back. ”

“Man Xing nodded. “Chairman Zhao, I know your performance these few days. Don’t worry, as long as I’m here, no one will dare to touch you.” ”

“”Thank you, Miss Man Xing, thank you!”Zhao Shan Dong said excitedly. ”

“”No need to thank me.”Man Xing looked down at Zhao Shan Dong and continued, “You should thank yourself properly.” ”

One sentence had two meanings.

“It was a threat, but it was also a blow. ”

“If Zhao Shan Dong had betrayed her, he would have gone to Hell long ago. ”

“Zhao Shan Dong was stunned for a moment, and cold sweat almost broke out in an instant. These two siblings of the man family were indeed not to be trifled with. Man Wen seemed to be a silkpants, but in fact, he was deeply hidden. Man Xing, on the other hand, was not a kind person from the beginning to the end.., after that, Zhao Shan Dong quickly reacted. “Miss Man Xing, don’t worry. I, Zhao, will never betray you no matter what!” ”

“Yes.”Man Xing nodded. “I understand. Get Up First.”

“Upon receiving man Xing’s orders, Zhao Shan Dong immediately stood up from the ground. ”

“”Remember what you said today.”Man Xing gently folded a flower. “Otherwise, this flower will be your end.” ”

She used the most gentle voice to say the most vicious words.

“Zhao Shan Dong immediately said, “Miss Man Xing, don’t worry. I will do my best for You!” ”

“”Go,”man Xing continued. ”

“”Okay.”Zhao Shan Dong nodded. “Miss Man Xing, I’ll be leaving first.” ”

“Okay.”Man Xing nodded.

“Zhao Shan Dong walked out. At this moment, man Xing seemed to have thought of something and said, “Wait.” ”

“Zhao Shan Dong immediately stopped in his tracks. “Miss Man Xing, do you have any other instructions?” ”

Man Xing picked up a document from the table and threw it to Zhao Shan Dong. “Take care of this.”

“Zhao Shan Dong took the document. “Yes, Miss Man Xing.” ”

“Looking at Zhao Shan Dong’s back as he left, man Xing narrowed his eyes. ”

“After coming out of the office, Zhao Shan Dong let out a deep breath. ”

“Man Xing had not said a single harsh word from the beginning to the end, but it had scared him badly. His back was drenched in cold sweat. ”

“Soon, Zhao Shandong left the presidential palace. ”

On the other side.

“Man Wen was sitting in a corner of the small black room. At this moment, the door of the small black room was pushed open. ”

“Before Man Wen could react, a cold light flashed over. ”

Bang Bang Bang —

“Nothing could be heard in the darkness, only the sound of a few heavy objects falling to the ground. ”

“Are you going to confess?”

“”No.”Man Wen was pressed to the ground by the three strong men, wiping away the blood at the corner of his mouth. ”

“”Okay, you’re not going to confess, right? If not, you’re prepared to stay here for the rest of Your Life!”One of them stood up from the ground. “Let’s go.” ”

The other two immediately followed his footsteps.

“After closing the door of the small black room, the figures of the three people appeared under the light. ”

They were wearing uniforms and had tall and big figures.

“If there were anyone present, they would definitely be able to recognize that these three were the top guards of Manxing country. ”

“”Boss, are we going to let Manwen off just like that?”One of them caught up to the leading man’s footsteps. ”

“The leader narrowed his eyes. “Don’t worry, Man Wen won’t be able to hold on much longer.” ”

He had placed a few pheasant necks in the small dark room just now.

“Seeing him like this, the man asked, “Boss, you released the Pheasant Necks?” ”

“Yes.”

“Pheasant necks were a very rare type of snake. In the entire S galaxy, only the Shangguan family could tame this type of snake. ”

“Chicken head snake body, killing in the invisible. ”
