“Zhou Rui said, “I think Cen Yuyan is an old hen that can’t lay eggs.” ”

Song Chenyu narrowed his eyes. “What do you mean?”

“”We don’t have any contraception when we’re together, but she just can’t get pregnant.” ”

Can’t get pregnant?

“Song Chenyu continued, “Think of a way yourself! If you want to become the son-in-law of the CEN family, you have to make Cen Yuyan pregnant!” ”

“Zhou Rui also knew the importance of this matter and continued, “When will your one million be transferred over?” ”

“Right away.”

“”Then hurry up,”Zhou Rui continued, “There’s no money in my card.” ”

“Although one million was a little little, it was still better than nothing. ”

“No matter how thin a mosquito’s leg was, it was still meat! ”

“After song Chenyu hung up the phone, he logged into the online bank and transferred the money over. ”

“Before Zhou Rui entered the house, he received a text message saying that he had successfully received the money. ”

“Seeing him enter, Cen Yuyan asked curiously, “Where did you go?” ”

Zhou Rui raised his phone. “I went out to take a call.”

“A call from the company?”Cen Yuyan asked.

Zhou Rui nodded.

“Cen Yuyan sighed. “Unfortunately, I can’t help you now.” ”

Zhou Rui walked over and put his arm around Cen Yuyan’s shoulder. “Taking care of yourself is the greatest help to me.” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Cen Yuyan’s face was full of smiles. “You’re the only one who knows how to Coax Me.”

“”I’m not coaxing you.”Zhou Rui continued, “Everything I said to you, every word I said was from the bottom of my heart.” ”

“The next morning, Zhou Rui made a trip home. ”

“When mother Zhou saw that he had returned, she asked curiously, “Rui Rui, why are you back today?” ”

“Zhou Rui looked at Mother Zhou. “Mother, I want Cen Yuyan to be pregnant. Do you have any ideas?” ”

“Zhou Rui’s grandmother had some medical skills and was very good at treating infertility. Later on, when Zhou Rui’s grandmother got old, she passed this skill to mother Zhou. ”

“Why? She can’t get pregnant by herself?”Mother Zhou asked.

“Yes.”Zhou Rui nodded.

Mother Zhou looked at Zhou Rui. “Wait a moment.”

“After saying that, she turned around and walked into the house. ”

Zhou Rui stood where he was.

“A moment later, mother Zhou walked out of the house and handed Zhou Rui a small box. “Take this and try it out. As long as it’s not a big problem, it should be useful.” ”

“Under normal circumstances, there were very few women who were infertile. ”

Many people who were unable to get pregnant were just suffering from an endocrine disorder.

“Zhou Rui took the box and smiled. “Thank you, Mom. Just wait for your first grandchild.” ”

“Mother Zhou continued, “Didn’t you go back with her to meet her parents yesterday? What did their family say?” ”

“Zhou Rui shook his head. “The situation isn’t too good. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be in such a hurry to get her pregnant.” ”

“”You’re eighteen years younger than Cen Yuyan, and you’re so outstanding. How can their family not be satisfied?”Mother Zhou stood up excitedly. “If they’re not satisfied, it should be us who are dissatisfied! What’s there to be dissatisfied about?” ”

“From mother Zhou’s point of view, Cen Yuyan was here to curry favor with Zhou Rui. ”

What right did she have to be dissatisfied with Zhou Rui if she was here to curry favor with him?

“Zhou Rui said, “The CEN family is a prestigious family after all.” ”

“”Nonsense,”mother Zhou said. “If it wasn’t for the fact that they’re from a prestigious family, would I have agreed to let the two of You Be Together?” ”

...

On the other side.

“After filming of Country 2 ended, Song Chenyu received an invitation from the program team to attend the press conference of Country 3. ”

Song Chenyu gladly invited her.

“However, before attending the press conference, she still had a big matter to attend to. ”

“Song Chenyu opened her chat tool and anonymously sent a photo to Dong Lou, who was known as the ‘number one paparazzi’in the circle. ”

“In the photo, there was a young man and woman. ”

“The girl’s features were like a painting, and she had a devastatingly beautiful appearance. ”

“The man was dressed in a plain robe, and his facial features were extremely cold. He stood beside her, and the two of them held each other’s hands tightly. Their posture was intimate, and one look was enough to tell that they were a couple in love. ”

“With the broadcast of “Country 2″, Ye Zhuo’s popularity on the internet was getting higher and higher. The topic even surpassed many A-list celebrities. ”

“If the photos were to be exposed at this time, it would definitely cause a huge uproar. ”

“Cen Shaoqing was a low-key person. He had once declared that he was not going to get married. For such a person, he would definitely not admit that he had a girlfriend in front of the media. ”

“Not only would cen Shaoqing not admit it, but he would also be very angry. ”

Who would benefit the most from exposing a relationship?

It would definitely be Ye Zao.

“After all, if ye Zao wanted to firmly tie Cen Shaoqing down, he had to make this matter known to everyone and force Cen Shaoqing to admit that he had a girlfriend in front of everyone. ”

“Therefore, Cen Shaoqing would definitely think that ye Zao had asked someone to expose this photo. ”
