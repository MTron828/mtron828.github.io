“She hadn’t even started playing, but that kind of aura had already been emitted.”

Could it be.

She really knew how to play the piano?

“Everyone looked at each other and saw the doubt in each other’s eyes. They began to urge ye Zao, “Miss Lin, you only talk and don’t pretend. Hurry up and start!”” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ye Zao tilted her head slightly and her slender fingers jumped on the piano keys.

What the F * ck?

They really knew how to play!

The banquet was suddenly quiet as everyone looked at Ye Zao.

Feng Xianxian narrowed her eyes.

Ding ding —

“At this moment, a few notes that were out of rhythm jumped out from ye Zao’s fingertips.”

Laughter erupted during the banquet.

This was also called knowing how to play the piano?

Feng Xianxian’s eyes were also filled with sarcasm.

Old Lady Lin felt that her old face had been completely thrown away by this wild girl tonight!

“If Feng Xianxian were on stage, she would definitely win the applause of the entire hall!”

Ye Zhuo would only embarrass her.

Did this ignorant wild girl think that they were in the countryside?

“At this moment, Old Mrs. Lin wished that she could crawl under the table.”

“”Miss Lin, that’s not how you play the piano! Let Xianxian go up and show you what it means to truly play the piano!””

“That’s right!”

“Don’t embarrass yourself if you don’t know how to play it.”

“...”

“Old Lady Lin braced herself and stood up. She walked to Lin Jincheng’s side and said in a low voice, “Jincheng! Hurry up and get her off me!””

Wasn’t it embarrassing enough?

Old Lady Lin had never been humiliated like this in her life.

“Lin Jincheng frowned slightly. “Mom, don’t add to the mess. Zao Zao knows how to play it. He was just testing the timbre just now.”He trusted ye Zao very much. He knew that ye Zao was not joking.”

“Old Lady Lin’s face was full of anger. “You’re not bringing her down, right? Then I’ll do it myself!”As the old lady of the Lin family, she could not let the Lin family’s face be completely disgraced by this wild girl!”

“Old Lady Lin turned to look at the crowd at the banquet and tried her best to hide the anger on her face, “I’m sorry, I let everyone see a joke!”! This girl grew up in Yunjing and had not learned to play the piano. Why not let Xianxian come up and play for everyone? Although Xianxian is not my biological granddaughter, she has grown up by my side since young. She is no different from my biological granddaughter.””

“If it weren’t for the sudden appearance of the mother and daughter, would she have lost face like this tonight?”

“Now, she could only rely on Feng Xianxian to save face.”

Feng Xianxian stood up and faced everyone’s gazes as she elegantly walked up to the stage.

“Old Lady Lin stood beside ye Zao and held back her anger. She gritted her teeth and said, “Hurry up and get off the stage.””

Ye Zao acted as if he didn’t hear Old Lady Lin’s voice. There wasn’t the slightest ripple on his picturesque face. His fair and slender hands were placed on the piano keys. He lowered his eyes slightly and the crystal light cast a faint layer of light on her body.

In the next second.

Her fingertips kept jumping on the black and white piano keys. Her slender fingertips looked like little elves on the black and white piano keys. It was beautiful and pleasing to the eye. The melodious sound of the piano rang out.

“From slow to urgent, it dripped down like raindrops.”

The banquet instantly fell silent.

“All eyes were fixed on ye Zao, as if intoxicated. They were almost immersed in the beautiful music.”

Including Old Lady Lin.

They were all stunned.

“During the banquet, someone recognized the name of this piece.”

“”This, this is the third piano concerto?””

“Oh my God! It really is!”

“Oh my God! Am I Dreaming?”

What was the Third Piano Concerto?

This piece was ranked number one on the top ten most difficult piano pieces in the world. This piece was endowed with the most resolute spirit and the strongest vitality!

“The composer of this piece of music also said that this was a piece of “Elephant’s work”because this piece of music was not only difficult in fingering, but also very physically exhausting, playing a piece of “Third emotion concerto”was equivalent to “Shoveling 10 tons of coal!””

“From this, it could be seen that playing the “Third emotion concerto”had the emotional impact!”

Not to mention ordinary people!

Even some professional pianists could not play it.

The number of people who could play it could be counted on one hand in the entire world.

Who would have thought that they would actually hear it at the Lin family’s banquet today.

The most terrifying thing was.

The player was actually the legendary idiot!

This was called an idiot?

This was called average musical talent?

“If her musical talent was average, then what were they called?”

Idiot?

Idiot?

“There weren’t many people present who didn’t know how to play the piano. When they heard the legendary playing sound, everyone was very excited and goosebumps rose all over their bodies!”
