Translator: 549690339

“”I’m ready,”Ye Ling said respectfully. ”

“”Let’s go,”Qiu di said. ”

Ye Ling immediately followed Qiu Di’s footsteps.

The three of them walked towards the nitrogen room inside.

The nitrogen room was at the innermost part of the research institute.

It would take about five minutes to walk there.

“Qiu Di suddenly asked to see ye Zhuo’s corpse, which made ye Ling somewhat puzzled. She then asked, “Miss Qiu, Did Something Happen?” ”

“Qiu di said, “Let’s go in first.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Ling nodded and followed Qiu Di’s footsteps.

“Soon, they arrived at the door of the liquid nitrogen room. ”

Qiu Di turned to look at Wu Han. “Wait at the door.”

“”Okay, Miss,”Wu Han said. ”

Qiu Di and Ye Ling walked into the liquid nitrogen room.

“As soon as they stepped into the liquid nitrogen room, the clothes on their bodies changed according to the temperature in the air. ”

This was called the constant temperature suit.

The inventor.

Ye Zao.

“Because the Earth’s energy was limited, the air-conditioning suit that ye Zao invented on earth did not reach the same level as the constant temperature suit. ”

“The constant temperature suit of the state of Changyue could be safe and sound even if it was in a high temperature of 1,000 degrees Celsius. ”

Qiu Di glanced at Ye Ling. “Has anyone come to the liquid nitrogen room recently?”

“”No.”Ye Ling shook her head. “According to your instructions, I’ve arranged for all the people who came to see her to go to the second annex.” ”

“Very good.”Qiu Di nodded.

The two of them continued walking inside.

“Very soon, they saw a transparent crystal coffin. ”

“When they entered, they saw a young woman lying inside the crystal coffin. ”

Her facial features were like a painting and could topple kingdoms and cities.

She lay there quietly like a Sleeping Beauty.

“Although the other party was only a corpse, when she saw her again, Qiu di could not help but be jealous. ”

And very jealous.

She was the same age as ye Zao.

But she was born better than ye Zao.

“Ye Zao was an orphan with no one to rely on. Ever since he was young, he lived in the open air. Qiu Di still remembered the scene when she first saw ye Zao. ”

At that time.

Ye Zao was 12 years old.

“Because he had been living in the open all year round, Ye Zao’s face was sallow and thin. A 12-year-old child weighed only 40 pounds! ”

“At that time, Qiu Di was a high and mighty young lady of the Qiu family. ”

Looking at ye Zao like this was like looking at a pitiful worm.

“At that time, Qiu Changzhen offered to let ye Zao stay and serve Qiu Di. ”

Qiu Di’s original words at that time were: “This kind of little girl is also qualified to be my servant? Is she worthy?”

Her daughter did not agree.

“Qiu Chang Town could not be forced, so ye Zhuo was adopted by the orphanage. ”

“When she saw ye Zhuo again, it was four years later. ”

Ye Zhuo was sixteen years old.

“At this time, Ye Zhuo was no longer the little girl from back then. ”

“She was confident and beautiful. Not only was she a renowned miracle doctor, but she was also the founder of the Ye Research Institute! ”

Not to mention that Qiu di had no presence in front of her.

“Even Qiu Chang Zhen, Qiu Di’s father, had to respectfully address her as “Miss Ye.” ”

How Could Qiu di accept this?

“After all, Ye Zao had almost become her servant! ”

“Before ye Zao appeared, Qiu Di was the number one beauty of Chang Yue and the candidate for the chief of Chang Yue. ”

“After ye Zao appeared, Qiu Di went from number one beauty to number two beauty. The candidate for Chief of Chang Yue also became ye Zao. Ye Zao did not even participate in the assessment and directly took the position of Chief. ”

Later on.

“Ye Zao’s reputation grew bigger and bigger, and everyone knew that there was Miss Ye. ”

As for Miss Qiu... ... She had long been forgotten by people.

Qiu Di still remembered attending a certain cocktail party.

“When the big shots were talking about ye Zao, a person who adored Qiu di casually mentioned Miss Qiu. ”

“In the end, everyone’s reaction was very consistent. ”

Who Was Miss Qiu?

They had never heard of her.

“With Miss Ye in front of them, no matter how good Miss Qiu did, she would not attract any attention. ”

Qiu Di knew very clearly that only when ye Zao died would she be able to turn over a new leaf.

“Fortunately, there were eyes in the sky. ”

Ye Zao died in an accident.

“When she heard the news, Qiu di cried out in excitement. ”

“Everyone thought that she was sad and sad, but little did they know that she was crying out of joy. ”

Dead.

“Ye Zao, that B * Tch, was finally dead! ”

“Autumn flute looked at ye Zao lying in the crystal coffin in front of her. The corners of her mouth curled up, and she heaved a sigh of relief. ” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The fact that the corpse was still there meant that that low-level human was nothing to be afraid of.

She had gone crazy!

She actually thought that ye Zao had the ability to cross the Earth from Planet E-TY889.

On the other side.

“Today was Xia Xiaoman’s due date. Although it was her due date, Xia Xiaoman’s stomach still did not move. ”

“In the afternoon, Lin Qingxuan could not wait any longer. She packed her things and accompanied Xia Xiaoman to the hospital for delivery. ”
