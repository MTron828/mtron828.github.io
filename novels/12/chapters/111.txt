Chapter 112: 077: setting people up online, birthday banquet venue 5

Her eyes were filled with disgust.

She would feel disgusted if she stayed in such a dirty place for even a second!

If Mu Yourong had not insisted on coming, how could she have appeared here?

Shen Rong could not imagine how much pain mu Yourong had suffered after following ye Shu for so many years!

At this moment, ye Zao came out of the room. The room was not air-conditioned, but she did not feel cold. She was wearing a white dress with a suspenders, and her exquisite collarbone was emitting a cold light in the air.

She was too beautiful.

Even if she wore such ordinary clothes, it was still impossible for people to shift their gazes away.

Mu Yourong looked at her, a look of jealousy appearing in her eyes.

However, it was almost over.

Ye Zao was so beautiful, but in the end, she still had to fall into hell.

She suffered all kinds of torture.

At this moment, Mu Yourong once again thought of the torture she had suffered in her previous life. It was not fear, but Joy!

It was very carefree!

After all, she had already escaped from hell.

And Ye Zhuo was walking into hell!

“Sister Ye Zhuo.”Mu Yourong raised a kind smile and greeted ye Zhuo.

Ye Zhuo was not in the mood to act with Mu Yourong today. “Why are you here?”

Shen Rong said with a cold face, “Is this how you talk to your sister?”

Ye Shu frowned slightly.

Usually, when she was at home, she would not be willing to say anything harsh to ye Zhuo.

What right did Shen Rong have? Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Her daughter was not born to be bullied by others.

Ye Shu turned around and looked at Shen Rong. “Zhuozhuo is my daughter now. She doesn’t have a sister! If Mrs. Mu wants to flaunt her status as a wealthy lady, go back to your mu family and flaunt it!”

Shen Rong’s face turned pale.

What kind of person was ye Shu?

A shameless mistress who had given birth to an illegitimate daughter!

She also dared to treat her like this.

Mu Yourong held Shen Rong’s hand and gestured for Shen Rong not to be angry. Then, she smiled at Ye Shu. “Auntie Ye, my mother has always been like this. Actually, she has a very good heart. Please don’t be calculative with her.”

Ye Shu increasingly felt that these two mother and daughter did not have good intentions. She frowned and said, “I will not accept your things. Our family’s temple is small, and it can not accommodate a great Buddha. The two of you should return to your rich areas.”

Mu Yourong was not angry either. She continued, “Aunt Ye, I know that we had many unpleasant things in the past. At that time, I was too young and did not know any better. I made you angry! I came here today to apologize to you.”

Ye Shu looked at Mu Yourong just like that.

The current Mu Yourong was dressed luxuriously and had an exquisite face. There was no trace of her past.

The only difference was that ye Shu felt that Mu Yourong was not as beautiful as she had been together.

The previous Mu Yourong was like a ball of light.

She brought her own brightness wherever she went.

She really could not understand what Mu Yourong was trying to do.

Ye Zhuo took a step forward and looked down at Mu Yourong. “Our family does not welcome you. Do you need me to repeat myself?”

Mu Yourong did not waste any more words. She took out a red invitation card from her bag. “Sister Ye Zhuo, the day after tomorrow is the song family’s old lady’s 78th birthday banquet. I hope that you can attend it with me. This is the invitation card.”

With that, Mu Yourong turned to look at Shen Rong. “Mother, let’s go.”

Shen Rong nodded and followed Mu Yourong’s footsteps.

Ye Zhuo looked at the backs of the mother and daughter. He raised his brows slightly and picked up the invitation card on the table.

Song family.

Song Shiyu.

Ye Zhuo knew a little about song Shiyu.

Because recently, Zhao Yang wanted to work with song Shiyu.

But there were too many people who wanted to work with song Shiyu. Zhao Yang had never had the chance to make an appointment with him.

Ye Zhuo also wanted to get to know song Shiyu.

After all, he was a partner.

If this person was not worth working with, then there was no need for Zhao Yang to spend all his time on song Shiyu.

Ye Zhuo narrowed his eyes. She had originally not been interested in the birthday banquet that Mu Yourong had mentioned.

But now it seemed.

She still had to make a trip.

Ye Zhuo closed the invitation, a plan forming in his heart.

Just then, ye Shu carried the things that Mu Yourong had brought and ran out the door.

“Mom, what are you doing?”Ye Zhuo asked.

Ye Shu said, “They didn’t take their things with them. I’ll send them over.”Ye Shu really did not want the things that Mu Yourong had brought.

“Mom, they drove here. Even if you chase after them now, you won’t be able to catch up.”

Ye Shu frowned. “Then what should we do? Why don’t I call a cab and send them over?”

Ye Zhuo smiled. “Isn’t there a welfare home across from our house? Please send these things to the welfare home. Oh right, I also bought some clothes and toys. When the express delivery arrives, I’ll go with you.”

Ye Zao was an orphan in his previous life.
