Translator: 549690339

“Bai Jingshu continued, “I heard that Old Lady Shangguan’s health hasn’t been very good recently. Your Brother is quite anxious.” ”

“What’s the situation?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“Bai Jingshu said, “It’s said to be an old problem. I’m not too sure about the exact situation. I guess we’ll have to wait until we get there to find out.” ”

“Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Sister-in-law, wait for me here for a moment.” ”

“After saying that, ye Zao turned around and walked upstairs. ”

“Before Bai Jingshu could react, ye Zao’s figure had already disappeared in the direction of the spiral staircase. ”

“Ye Zao came upstairs and fiddled around in the pharmacy for a while. Finally, he took out a small porcelain bottle and walked downstairs. ”

“Sister-in-law.”Ye Zao handed the small porcelain bottle to Bai Jingshu. “Take this with you when you go to see Old Lady Shangguan.”

“Bai Jingshu took the small porcelain bottle and was stunned for a moment. She asked, “What is this?” ”

“”This is a medicine that can save Old Lady Shangguan’s life at a critical moment,”ye Zhuo continued. “There’s only one pill in it. Let my brother use it in an emergency.” ”

“Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded.

“Just then, ye Shu walked in from behind. When she saw Ye Zhuo, she asked in surprise, “When did ye Zhuo come back?” ”

“Ever since the incident in l continent, Ye Zao had not returned for nearly a month. ”

“”I just got home,”ye Zao said. ”

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “It’s good that you’re back. Your father said last night that he had not seen you for a long time.” ”

“”Mom, I have to leave after eating.” ”

“Hearing this, Ye Shu frowned slightly and said with some heartache, “Working overtime again?” ” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

She saw that ye Zhuo had lost weight during this period of time!

It was impossible for him to work overtime like this.

“Ye Zhuo explained, “It’s not overtime. I have an appointment with Cen Shaoqing to go to the South China Sea for a vacation.” ”

“Hearing that it was a vacation, ye Shu’s brows immediately relaxed. She smiled and said, “You young people should go out more. The South China Sea is not bad, the environment is good, and it’s warm. You guys should play for a while longer.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded.

“Then should we set off tonight?”Ye Shu continued to ask and answer.

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo continued to nod.

“Ye Shu said, “Then I’ll go and pack your luggage for you.” ”

Ye Zhuo was really tired from working overtime during this period of time. Ye Shu wanted her to rest more.

“Ye Zhuo said, “Mom, I can do it myself. You Don’t know what I’m going to bring.” ”

“”Just tell me what to bring,”ye Shu said. ”

“”Mom, there’s really no need. If I have the time to tell you, I might as well clean it up myself,”ye Zao said with a smile. ”

“Ye Shu nodded helplessly. “Okay, okay, okay. Then I’ll go to the kitchen to take a look.” ”

“”Okay, you can go.” ”

“Bai Jingshu followed ye Zao’s footsteps. “Zao Zao, I’ll go with you to clean up.” ”

“Sure.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“When they arrived at ye Zao’s room, Bai Jingshu helped him pack his things. ”

“The aunt and sister-in-law chatted as they packed their things. “Zao Zao, let me ask you a question.” ”

“”Okay,”ye Zao said. ”

“Bai Jingshu hesitated for a moment. She considered the words in her heart before continuing, “Zao Zao, you said that your brother and I have been married for so long. Why... why... Why hasn’t there been any news?” ”

Although ye Shu and Lin Jincheng didn’t urge anyone.

Bai Jingshu was still quite anxious.

“After all, they didn’t do anything after they got married. ”

She suspected that there was something wrong with her.

“Ye zhuozhuo smiled and said, “Sister-in-law, don’t be anxious. Children also pay attention to fate. When fate arrives, there will naturally be something.” ”

“”Zhuozhuo, why don’t you take a look at me? Is there something wrong with me?”Bai Jingshu asked. ”

“As an excellent Chinese medicine practitioner, ye Zao could tell that there was nothing wrong with Bai Jingshu at a glance. However, in order to reassure Bai Jingshu, ye Zao still extended his hand to check Bai Jingshu’s pulse, then, he said, “Sister-in-law, there’s nothing wrong with you. Let nature take its course.” ”

“Hearing that there was nothing wrong with her, Bai Jingshu heaved a sigh of relief. “Luoluo, thank you.” ”

“Ye zhuozhuo smiled and said, “We’re all family. What are you talking about?” ”

Bai Jingshu smiled as well.

“Ye Zhuozhuo asked, “Sister-in-law, did mom and the others rush you?” ”

“Otherwise, why would Bai Jingshu be in such a hurry. ”

“Bai Jingshu shook her head. “Neither of them rushed me. I just felt that it was a little strange. After all, it’s been so long.” ”

“”Don’t worry,”ye Zao said. ”

“Okay.”

“With Ye Zao’s words, Bai Jingshu was indeed relieved. After all, Ye Zao also had the identity of the famous Miracle Doctor Ye. ”

“Since ye Zao said it was fine, it was definitely fine. ”

“At this moment, Bai Jingshu seemed to have thought of something. She looked at ye Zao and asked, “Zao, you didn’t hide it from me, did you?” ”
