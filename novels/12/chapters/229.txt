Translator: 549690339

Ye Zao was not someone who liked to be in the limelight.

“Unfortunately, Mu Yourong refused to let go, making her the target of public criticism. Then she would accompany Mu Yourong and have fun! ”

Let her know what a true expert was!

Ye Zao really did not take Mu Yourong’s tender handwriting seriously.

“Hearing this, Mu Yourong was stunned. ”

She did not expect ye Zao to suddenly agree.

“Ye Zao was struggling on the brink of death, right? ”

“After all, Ye Zao grew up in the Mu family from a young age. He received the best education, but he became a trash that everyone knew. ”

“And she lived in the lowest level of the slums, but she was still outstanding! Who knew how many streets she had surpassed ye Zao! ”

“Thinking of this, the corners of Mu Yourong’s lips curled up, and her heart was extremely happy. ”

“With the contrast of the green leaves, the red flowers would become even more beautiful. ”

At this moment.

She was the king of the flowers!

“Xu Jiao looked at Ye Zao with a smile, her eyes full of ridicule, “Everyone in Yun Jing knows about Miss Ye’s reputation. Since you don’t have the ability, Miss Ye, you’d better not force yourself and save everyone’s time.”What a disgrace! ”

A trash who couldn’t even hold a brush properly actually dared to compete in calligraphy with Mu Yourong.

He really overestimated himself!

“”Hearing is believing, seeing is believing. Miss Xu comes from a prestigious family, how could she not understand such a simple principle?”Ye Zhuo slightly raised his eyes to look at Li Qiandong. “I’ll have to trouble Mister Li to get someone to bring me another brush.” ”

Li Qiandong nodded and immediately got someone to prepare the brush.

“Very soon, the servant came over with the brush. ”

Ye Zhuo took the brush and came to the table. He picked up another brush with his left hand and held a brush in each hand. He leaned slightly and began to dip the brush in ink.

“A wisp of black hair drooped down from the side of his face mischievously, adding a bit of liveliness and beauty to it. ”

“Seeing this action of Ye Zhuo, everyone was a little surprised. ”

“Holy Sh * t! What does she want to Do?”

“Use both hands? Write with both hands at the same time?”

“”If she’s really using both hands, then she’s Too Amazing!” ”

“She’s faking it! She’s definitely faking it! She’s just stalling for time!”

“Ye Zao was just a trash who couldn’t even read properly, so how could he use both hands at the same time. ”

Not to mention ye Zao.

Even a famous calligrapher was unable to use both hands at the same time.

Mu Yourong just looked at ye Zao.

Her eyes were full of pride.

“Like everyone else, she didn’t believe that ye Zao could do this. ” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

She wanted to see how ye Zao would end up.

“However, Ye Zao’s reputation was bad enough, so she probably didn’t care if it was even worse. ”

“A stepping stone was a stepping stone. No matter how hard she tried, she could only become a stepping stone. ”

It wasn’t just Mu Yourong and Xu Jiao. The others present were also waiting to see ye Zao make a fool of himself.

“Some people even turned on their phones, ready to post ye Zao’s embarrassing situation on their wechat moments. ”

It was also at this moment that ye Zao dipped his pen in ink and slightly straightened his back. He raised his pen with both hands and pressed the tip of the pen on the rice paper.

His movements were very fluid.

“From a distance, he could even see the graceful beauty of martial arts. ”

“Very quickly, two lines of words appeared on the Xuan paper on the left and right sides: concealing cleverness while being clumsy, using obscurity while being clear; concealing clarity while being muddled, using bending as an extension. ”

“The Strokes formed the wind, the strokes were horizontal, vigorous and powerful! ”

The words on the left and right sides each had their own style.

One stroke and one stroke were both extremely shocking.

It had the power to Swallow Mountains and rivers!

“This calligraphy could not be written by a master without several decades of cultivation, not to mention that she was drawing from both sides. ”

“Originally, Mu Yourong’s calligraphy could still be read. However, with the contrast between these two characters, the calligraphy on the side was like that of a primary school student. ”

There was no contrast at all!

“This round, Ye Zao won extremely beautifully! ”

At this moment.

The entire room was silent.

No one had expected that ye Zao actually had this ability.

She had actually accomplished something that even the calligraphy masters had not done!

Was this really that good-for-nothing?

Everyone had different expressions on their faces.

Those who had originally wanted to laugh at Ye Zao were all dumbfounded.

“This, this was just too amazing! ”

Layer after layer of cold sweat broke out on Mu Yourong’s back.

Just what was going on with ye Zao?

“She was clearly a good-for-nothing who did not even know a few big words, so how could she have written such a beautiful calligraphy? ”

“Clap Clap Clap!”

Deafening applause rang out from the surroundings.

How intense the applause at this moment was.

Mu Yourong’s expression was extremely unsightly.

“She was the legitimate eldest daughter of the Mu family, but today, she actually lost to a fake daughter who was occupying the magpie’s nest. ”

“Moreover, this fake daughter was a trash that everyone knew about. ”
