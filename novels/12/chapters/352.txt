“Chapter 353: 109: Great Burning’s first kiss with Fifth Master, Old Madam Song dies of illness! 6”

Translator: 549690339

It was a wechat notification tone.

“She had just sent a voice message in the group chat of ‘love each other as a family’, and now there was a reply. ”

Little Four: [ Grandma is listening to Huangmei Opera again [ Dog Head ]]

Old Madam Cen immediately replied: [ this is sung by my granddaughter-in-law! ]

“Her typing speed was particularly slow, and it took a while before she sent it out. ”

“As soon as this message was sent out, the four Cen Sisters, who were originally diving, immediately popped up. ”

Xiao Er: [ really? Sister-in-law knows this? ]

“Boss: [ Sister-in-law’s voice is not bad! It’s simply amazing! She must be even more beautiful, right? Grandma, please send a photo to satisfy our sister’s curiosity! ] ”

“Xiao San: [ Grandma, please show mercy and satisfy our curiosity! ] ”

“After a long while, old Mrs. Cen replied: [ my granddaughter-in-law is the most beautiful woman in the world! But now is not the time for you to see her true colors! ] ”

“Lao Er: [ in order to welcome my future sister-in-law, I have prepared a lot of gifts for her! Grandma, please let us take a look, just for a moment! ] ”

Old Mrs. Cen: [ No! What if you scare her? ]

Second: [ crying/emoji ]

“Little Four: [ Grandma, does my future sister-in-law look better than a fish? ] ”

Old Mrs. Cen: [ my granddaughter-in-law looks so much better than that fish! ]

“Sitting on the plane, Cen Shaoqing also saw the wechat message in the group. ”

He scrolled up and saw the voice message that old Mrs. Cen had sent.

He clicked play.

It was a very pleasant sound.

It was melodious.

“After listening to the voice message, the corners of Cen Shaoqing’s mouth curled up slightly, and he clicked collect. ”

“After Old Mrs. Cen finished editing the text message, she suddenly remembered that Cen Shaoqing was also in the group! ”

Could This brat have already seen these wechat messages?

“If he had seen them, how would she trick Cen Shaoqing in the future? ”

No!

She must not let Cen Shaoqing see her!

“Cen Shaoqing was going to country P today. He was on the plane, so he definitely did not have time to look at wechat. Old Mrs. Cen was frantically scrolling through emojis again, planning to upload these messages. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen sent out a few hundred emojis in a row, only then was she satisfied. ”

Little did she know that Cen Shaoqing had seen all of this.

It was not until evening that ye Zhuo drove home.

“Just as he reached home, his phone rang. ”

Ye Zhuo picked up the phone. “Hello.”

“It’s me.”A deep and magnetic voice entered his ears.

“Fifth brother?”Ye Zhuo was stunned. He did not expect him to call her.

“”Yes.”CEN Shaoqing continued, “I’m already in country P.” ”

“Ye Zhuo said, “Alright. I heard that country P is in a rather chaotic period of time. Pay attention to your safety and don’t go out at night.” ”

Was she concerned about him?

The corners of Cen Shaoqing’s mouth curled up slightly. “I understand.”

Ye Zhuo chatted with him for a while more before hanging up.

Cen Shaoqing raised his head to look at the rising sun in the sky. His eyes were filled with warmth.

“After a moment, he turned to look at his secretary behind him. “Let’s go.” ”

The secretary immediately followed Cen Shaoqing’s footsteps.

Over here.

Ye Zao had just hung up on Cen Shaoqing when he received a call from ye Sen.

“Thinking about it, Ye Sen and Cen Shaoqing should be on the same flight. ”

...

“In the blink of an eye, another three days passed. ”

On this day.

Ye Zao was watering the flowers in the small garden in front of the door.

“Suddenly, he heard someone calling her from outside. ”

Ye Zao raised his eyes slightly and saw song Shiyu in a suit with a solemn expression.

“Brother Song?”

“Song Shiyu nodded slightly and tried to make it as short as possible. “Ye Zhuo, my grandmother is dying. Can you come with me to see her?” ” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo put down the kettle and placed his hands on the railing in front of the small garden before flipping over.

“His movements were fluid and smooth, and he was extremely handsome. ”

Song Shiyu was stunned. “Don’t you need to close the balcony door?”

Ye Zao’s voice was shallow. “No need. There’s a robot at home. Where did you park your car? Let’s go quickly.”

“Follow me this way.”

Ye Zao followed song Shiyu’s footsteps.

“After getting into the car, song Shiyu habitually peeled a milk candy and put it in his mouth. He also passed a milk candy to ye Zao. ”

“Thank you.”Ye Zao took the milk candy.

“The car was very fast, and they arrived at the song residence in a short while. ”

Old Madam Song’s courtyard was very quiet.

Sister Hong’s eyes lit up when she saw ye Zhuo following behind song Shiyu. She quickly went into the house to inform Old Madam Song.

“Old Madam Song, who was lying on the bed, was in a very bad state of mind. ”

She was already holding her breath.

“Grandma Song.”
