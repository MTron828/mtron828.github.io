“Come in.”

Two middle-aged men in white lab coats walked in from outside.

“Nie Gong.” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Seeing the appearance of the people, old nie smiled and said, “Old Wang, Old Li, take a seat.” ”

“Old Wang, Old Li, leaned over and sat opposite old nie. ”

“After a moment, old Wang said hesitantly, “Old NIE, I heard that Dr. Warne, Dr. Millet, and the Feiyu team have joined Miss Ye’s research team. Do you think they can really build an aircraft carrier?” ”

“If the aircraft carrier plan really succeeded, then they would be throwing away the watermelon and picking up the sesame! ”

Old Li was also very worried about this problem and looked at old nie anxiously.

“Old Nie lit a cigarette and took a deep puff, then, he said, “Building an aircraft carrier is not just talk, and it is not something that can be accomplished by Dr. Millet, Dr. Warne, and Feiyu’s team! If it is really that simple, why would c nation wait until now?” ”

“With that said, Old Wang and old Li heaved a sigh of relief. ”

“At this point, old nie continued, “Just wait and see. Miss ye will be as down and out as she is today!” ”

“The higher one’s height, the worse one’s fall will be. This wasn’t just a saying. ”

“Hearing this, Old Wang and old Li both nodded. ”

...

“Not long after, the live broadcast video of the press conference was spread everywhere. ”

The whole internet was in an uproar!

“In just one morning, Weibo was paralyzed with more than a few poems. ”

This incident even shocked the foreign scientific and technological community.

Even the foreign media started to speak up.

Completing the aircraft carrier project within two years?

Landing on the eight planets?

Was this a dream?

“At the same time, Ye Zhuo also received news of foreign aid. ”

Many foreign scientific and technological bigwigs wanted to join her laboratory.

“However, ye Zao rejected all of them. ”

An aircraft carrier was not a small matter.

“If they allowed foreigners to join the experiment at this time, it would be hard to explain. ”

Could it be that China could not build its own aircraft carrier without foreigners?

“Because of this matter, the foreign media websites were also in an uproar. ”

[ I heard that Dr. YC rejected the help of country C and Country D! is he going into seclusion? Have they forgotten how the Great Qing dynasty fell? ]

“[ with such an attitude, you still want to land on the eight planets? In Your Next Life! ] ”

“[ there’s an old Chinese saying, ‘kindness is like a donkey’s liver and lungs’. If you are in a quagmire, we will help you out of kindness. It’s fine if you don’t get up, but you still have to roll around in your hole. There’s no one like this! ] ”

“[ complete the aircraft carrier plan in two years? Hehe! Forget about two years, with your brains, you might not even be able to complete it in twenty years! ] ”

[ how many years has it been since the Qing dynasty fell? Why don’t they know how to Learn? ]

[ this is the best joke I’ve heard in 20120! Building an aircraft carrier! Isn’t this pushing the IQ of the big shots in C Nation’s technology industry to the ground? ]

[20 years? Saying that they can complete the aircraft carrier project in 20 years is looking up to them! Do they really think that they can hide at home and build an aircraft carrier just because they happened to be in the limelight at the Technology Competition last year? Aren’t they overestimating themselves too much? ]

“[ with the intelligence of Chinese people, I’m afraid they will have to wait for 200 years! ] ”

[ some people happened to be in the limelight at the Science and Technology competition. They don’t even know who they are anymore! ]

Zhao Xueyin browsed through the news comments on the foreign media websites one by one.

She narrowed her eyes slightly.

It turned out that there was another reason for ye Zhuo to be in the limelight at the Science and Technology competition and to crush the boss of C Nation.

She was just saying.

How could a young girl who was only 20 years old have such a perverse ability!

“This time, Ye Zao had really gone too far! ”

He even said something about an aircraft carrier!

Building an aircraft carrier?

He was really arrogant.

Arrogant and brainless.

“Zhao Xueyin shook her head, her eyes filled with ridicule. ”

“At this moment, a rapid phone ringtone sounded in the air. ”

Zhao Xueyin picked up the phone. “Hello.”

“What are you planning to do?”Father Zhao’s voice came from the other end of the phone.

“Zhao Xueyin continued, “Probably tomorrow or the day after.” ”

“At the moment, she and Ye Zhuo had already fallen out. There was no point in staying here any longer. ”

“”Then come back tomorrow.”Father Zhao continued, “I’ll Get Ah Lui to come pick you up.” ”

Zhao Xueyin knew what the uniform was thinking. “There’s no need for Big Brother SI to pick me up. I can come back by myself.”

But father Zhao did not give Zhao Xueyin the chance to refuse and directly hung up the phone.

Zhao Xueyin looked at the phone that was hung up and sighed helplessly.

“In a moment, Zhao Xueyin closed the laptop, stood up from the chair, picked up the car keys, and walked out. ”
