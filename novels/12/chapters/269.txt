Translator: 549690339

“Seeing her daughter like this, Zhao Pingting’s mother sighed, she said earnestly, “Pingting, you’re not young anymore. You should know that it’s not easy for your father and I to earn money. Since you know that you’re wrong, Let’s just forget about this matter. After dinner, your sister-in-law and I will think of a way to return the things. You can go to the driving school and learn how to drive.” ”

Learn how to drive.

“If this was in the past, Zhao Pingting would definitely be very happy. ”

“This was because before the college entrance examination, she had made an appointment with ye Zhuo to learn how to drive together. ”

“But now, she wouldn’t. ”

“At this moment, there was only bitterness in Zhao Pingting’s eyes. “Mom, I wasn’t joking with you yesterday. I don’t want to learn how to drive. You can go to the driving school and return the tuition fees.” ”

“Why?”Mother Zhao was very confused. “Didn’t we agree to learn how to drive after your college entrance exam?”

Zhao Pingting shook her head. “I’m just suddenly not interested in learning how to drive.”

“Mother Zhao’s anger, which had finally calmed down, was now raging again, “Pingting, what’s the matter with you? You’re the one who wants to learn how to drive! You’re the one who doesn’t want to learn how to drive! I just went to pay the tuition fee yesterday. You want me to go and get the tuition fee back today? Is this a joke?” ”

Zhao Pingting’s mother was exhausted from work every day. It wasn’t easy for her to get off work and get some rest. She even had to find time to go to the driving school to pay for Zhao Pingting’s tuition.

But Zhao Pingting was fine. She said she didn’t want to learn.

“Zhao pingting bit her lip. “Mom, I really don’t want to learn anymore. I hope you can understand me.”As she said this, Zhao Pingting paused, then she continued, “I don’t want to quarrel with you, so don’t be angry. I know that I’ve made you and my dad worry a lot over the years. In the future, I’ll be obedient and never make you angry again. Don’t force me to learn how to drive, okay?” ”

“Hearing this, Zhao Pingting’s mother’s heart softened a little. She held Zhao Pingting’s hand, “Pingting, tell me, What’s wrong with you? Did Someone Bully You? Or did you encounter something unhappy? As long as you say it, I will think of a way to help you solve it.” ”

Although Zhao Pingting had many common problems that many children had.

“Compared to most children, she was still a good child that made her parents less worried. ”

“Although her academic results were not very good, with her hard work, she still managed to obtain very good results in the college entrance examination. ”

“During this period of time, mother Zhao felt that she had gained a lot of glory in the workplace. ”

What about Beijing Normal University!

“In their workplace, there were really not many children who could do better than Zhao Pingting. ”

Mother Zhao just could not understand.

How did this child suddenly become like this!

“Zhao Pingting shook her head. “No, Mom, I’m fine. Don’t let your imagination run wild.” ”

“Then why don’t you learn how to drive?”

“”No reason. I just don’t want to learn anymore.”Zhao pingting continued, “Mom, don’t return those things to my sister-in-law. When I bought them yesterday, she already told me that she doesn’t support returning and exchanging goods. It’s a waste of time for you to go over there.” ”

“When she heard that the items couldn’t be returned, Zhao Pingting’s mother was instantly enraged. She couldn’t contain her anger. “You’re buying things that can’t be returned and exchanged! That’s 28,000 yuan! Did you read too much into your brain?” ” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The corners of Zhao Pingting’s mouth curled up into a bitter smile. “Just think of it as me reading too much into my brain.”

“Hearing this, Zhao Pingting’s mother was furious. “Then go and work for me during the summer vacation! When you earn back this 28,000 yuan, I’ll forgive you.” ”

She had to let Zhao Pingting know that money was not so easy to earn!

“Otherwise, Zhao Pingting would never learn. ”

“Zhao Pingting looked up at Mother Zhao. “If working during the summer vacation can make you not angry, I will go.” ”

“Mother Zhao continued, “The restaurant downstairs is still short of a waiter. I have a good relationship with the lady boss there. I will tell her in a while. You Go to work.” ”

“Okay.”Zhao pingting nodded.

“During dinner, Zhao Pingting told her family about this matter. ”

Tang Jia was very happy to hear this.

“This way, Zhao Yingjun would not be angry with her over the 28,000 yuan. ”

“Not only would he not be angry, she would also get a set of high-end skincare products for free! ”

This business was not a loss.

“”Little Sister! It’s normal for girls to work out during the summer vacation. When they hoe the crops, sweat will drip down the soil. Only when you personally experience it will you know how hard it is for us adults to earn money! “Otherwise, you might think that money fell from the sky!” ”

“”Yes.”Zhao pingting nodded. “Sister-in-law, you’re right.” ”

After breakfast.
