[ are you for real [ Dog Head ] ? ]

[ yes. ]

[ then come to my room. ]

“A minute later, ye Zao heard a knock on the door. ”

He really lives next door to me?

Ye Zao put down his phone and walked over to open the door.

“As soon as he opened the door, he saw a tall figure standing outside the door. His facial features were hidden under the crystal light. His thin lips were slightly pursed, and there was a layer of coldness in his abstinence, the Little Red Mole at the end of his eyes happened to correspond with the Buddha Pearl between his fingers. ”

“It looked like a Buddha, but also a demon. ”

“You really live next door to me?”Ye Zao was a little surprised.

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Ye Zao had just taken a shower. His hair was wet, and he was wearing the silk nightdress with a sling that exposed his white collarbone. His skin was as white as snow, and it was as smooth as jade. The smooth silk material outlined his beautiful figure. ”

“The silk material was a little thin and CEN Shaoqing was 20 centimeters taller than ye Zao. As long as he lowered his head, he could see the... ... soft. ”

Bang —

Something exploded inside Cen Shaoqing’s body.

It made him feel like his entire body was burning.

Don’t look when it’s indecent.

“He moved his gaze away and continued, “I just moved in today. Do you want to have supper?” ”

“”Yes, but wait for me to change.” ”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

Ye Zhuo closed the door.

“Three minutes later, Ye Zhuo opened the door again. “Let’s go.” ”

“She changed into a white t-shirt, a pair of ripped jeans, and a pair of white shoes. ”

It was less cold.

It was more youthful and lively.

“She was like a walking clothes rack. No matter what she wore, she could have her own unique style. ”

Cen Shaoqing followed her footsteps.

“Ye Zhuo turned to look at him. “Where are we going to eat? You’re from Beijing. You should know where the food is delicious, right?” ”

“I know a place that’s not too far from here.”

“Alright.”Ye Zhuo nodded. “We’ll go to the place you mentioned.”

The two of them had just reached the hotel when a luxury car drove over.

“The driver got out of the car and said respectfully, “Master Five.” ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Let’s go for half a month.”

“Alright.”

Cen Shaoqing opened the car door and looked up at Ye Zhuo. “Get in the car.”

Ye Zhuo leaned forward and got into the car.

“When she got into the car, Cen Shaoqing had even carefully covered his hands on the roof of the car. ”

The driver was a little surprised.

He even thought that he had seen wrongly.

When had the fifth master ever been so close to the opposite sex?

And... He was so considerate.

They even stayed in the same hotel.

Could it be that the CEN family was going to have a young madam?

“At 11 o’clock in the capital, the night life had just begun. ”

There were gorgeous neon lights everywhere.

“In a short while, the car drove into a very simple street. ”

“White walls, green bricks, tiled stone roads. ”

There were two small lanterns hanging in front of every door.

It gave people the illusion that they had traveled through time and space.

“Ye Zhuo looked out of the window and asked curiously, “Where is this?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing said in a low voice, “This is the only street in the capital that retains ancient buildings. This place has a history of several hundred years.” ”

The driver in the front seat added in his heart.

This street belonged to Master Five.

“In order to preserve this ancient street,. ”

Cen Shaoqing bought this entire long street at the age of 20 with a huge sum of money.

“Nowadays, the price of houses in the capital was increasing day by day. ”

This place was already priceless.

The price had increased more than a thousand times!

The speed of the car slowed down until it stopped in front of an ancient courtyard house.

Ye Zhuo got out of the car and looked up.

He saw a plaque hanging in the middle of the two lanterns in front of the door.

There were three gilded words on the plaque.

Half a month.

“Is this the place you mentioned?”Ye Zhuo looked back at Cen Shaoqing.

“Cen Shaoqing held the Buddhist beads and walked to ye Zhuo’s side. “Yes, this is the place. Let’s go in.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

The two of them walked inside.

“Just like the outside, the interior was decorated in an antique style. ”

“At this moment, a white-haired old man walked out from inside. “Shaoqing is here.” ”

“Aunt Lang.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

Aunt Lang raised her head and looked at Ye Zhuo. A dazzling light flashed in her eyes. “This is?”

“”Let me introduce you. This is my friend Ye Zhuo. Ye Zhuo, Aunt Lang is the boss here.” ”

“Ye zhuo greeted politely, “Aunt Lang.” ”

They were getting closer.

“Only then did ye Zhuo realize that although this aunt Lang had white hair, she was not as old as he had imagined. ”

She was at most 60 years old.

“When he saw that Aunt Lang had white hair, Ye Zhuo had thought that she was an 80-90-year-old old woman. ”
