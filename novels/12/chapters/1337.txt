Chapter 1338: 277: Xie Wanqiu’s secret. Stupid to the extreme

Translator: 549690339

“Okay.”Zheng Wanyin supported Xie wanqiu as they walked inside.

The nurse took Xie Wanqiu’s blood pressure.

“After taking the blood pressure, the nurse continued, “Her blood pressure is very normal. You can be discharged from the hospital at any time now.””

“Xie Wanqiu was very healthy, but such a healthy person actually stayed in the hospital for one or two days.”

“Now was the time when the beds were tight, but Xie Wanqiu did not leave. She insisted that she was not feeling well, and the hospital could not chase her away.”

The nurse could only give her a gentle reminder.

“Zheng wanyin said, “By the way, Miss Nurse, my grandmother’s appetite is not very good right now. May I ask if there is a problem?””

“The nurse continued, “Let me get you some stomach-strengthening and digestive pills. Try some first.””

“Zheng wanyin smiled and said, “Thank you.””

“You’re welcome.”

“Even after the nurse left the ward, ye Zao did not come.”

“Xie wanqiu looked up at Zheng Wanyin. “Yinyin, did you really see ye Zao Just Now?””

Zheng Wanyin nodded. “I’m sure I saw my cousin-in-law.”

“Then why isn’t she here yet?”Xie wanqiu asked.

“Logically speaking, ye Zao should have arrived by now.”

“But it had already been more than ten minutes, and she did not even see ye Zao’s shadow. Damn”

Zheng Wanyin thought for a moment. “I’m not too sure either.”

“After saying that, Zheng wanyin continued, “Let’s Wait a little longer. Perhaps cousin-in-law will be here soon.””

Zheng Wanyin could not be mistaken.

Why would ye Zao appear at the hospital for no reason?

“Of course, it was to apologize to Xie wanqiu.”

But was it that easy to apologize?

“Even if ye Zao had made up his mind, he probably wouldn’t be able to convince himself for a while.”

“However, since ye Zao was already here.”

He wouldn’t do something useless.

Hearing this.

Xie Wanqiu’s expression was very ugly.

Wait?

Ye Zao actually dared to make her wait!

Who Was She?

Cen Shaoqing’s grandmother.

Did Ye Zao still have an elder like her in his heart.

Xie wanqiu originally thought that ye Zao would only have to kowtow three times.

But now!

It was no longer a matter of kowtowing three times.

She had to let ye Zao know how powerful she was!

“Otherwise, ye Zao would never know that he cared about her.”

“Zheng wanyin continued, “Grandmother, why don’t we just forget about it? Cousin-in-law has already come to the hospital, which means that she has already realized her mistake. Why do you have to be so calculative with a Junior?””

“How many times have I told you not to call her cousin-in-law! She’s just a little slut!”

Zheng Wanyin lowered her head.

“It was unknown who this child, Zheng Wanyin, had taken after. She was so kind-hearted. Fortunately, she had her grandma to prepare for a rainy day. Otherwise, Zheng Wanyin would have been bullied to death.”

“In the blink of an eye, another ten minutes passed.”

But there was still no movement from ye Zhuo.

What was going on?

“Seeing that Xie Wanqiu’s expression was getting uglier and uglier, Zheng wanyin continued, “Grandma, I’ll go out and take a look.””

Xie wanqiu nodded.

“Seeing that Zheng Wanyin was about to walk out of the door, Xie wanqiu continued, “Yinyin, wait a moment.””

“”What’s wrong, Grandma?”Zheng Wanyin turned to look at Xie wanqiu.”

“Xie wanqiu continued, “Don’t look for that little b * Tch Ye Zhuo.””

“Okay.”Zheng Wanyin nodded. “I’m just going out to take a look.”

“Xie wanqiu continued, “Go ahead.””

Zheng Wanyin arrived at the lobby on the first floor.

“Coincidentally, just as Zheng Wanyin arrived at the lobby on the first floor, she saw ye Zhuo walking out of the elevator.”

There was a middle-aged man beside her.

The two of them talked as they walked.

“As they were too far away, Zheng Wanyin could not hear anything. However, based on Ye Zhuo’s mouth movements, she could roughly guess that ye Zhuo was calling that man uncle.”

Ye Zhuo’s uncle was here too?

Zheng Wanyin narrowed her eyes and walked behind the two of them without leaving a trace. Only then did she hear their conversation.

“Ye Sen smiled and said, “I already said that there was no problem. You insisted on me coming over for a check-up. Now You can rest assured! How can I not be clear about my own body?””

“Ye Zhuo held the report in his hand. “No matter what, it’s better to have a recheck and rest assured.””

“”Uncle.”At this moment, a tall figure walked in front of them. Against the light, it was difficult to see his facial features clearly, but looking at his figure, Zheng Wanyin recognized him at a glance. It was Cen Shaoqing.”

Why was Cen Shaoqing Here?

Could it be that he had come with Ye Zhuo and the others to admit his mistake.

“Shaoqing.”Ye Sen looked up. “Why are you here?”

“Cen Shaoqing held the Buddha beads in his left hand. “I heard that you were in the hospital for a re-examination, so I came over to take a look. How was the re-examination?””
