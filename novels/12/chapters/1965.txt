“However, the He family’s parents did not doubt her medical skills at all. ”

Ye Zao nodded slightly. “I’ll do my best.”

“After saying that, she sat by the bed and began to check he ziteng’s pulse. ”

He ziteng’s condition was indeed very serious.

It was still a little tricky.

“Seeing that ye Zao had not noticed her, Xu Yao slowly became bold. She raised her head to look at Ye Zao, her eyes filled with sarcasm. ”

What was ye Zao doing?

Checking his pulse?

It was simply ridiculous.

“Even if she wanted to act pretentious, it was not like that. ”

“What era was it now, and he still came to check his pulse. ”

Who Did ye Zao think he was?

The Godly Doctor Hua Tuo?

“In a moment, ye Zao released he ziteng’s wrist. ”

“Mother he immediately walked forward and asked, “Miss Ye, how is Ziteng?” ”

Ye Zao raised his eyes slightly and opened his red lips slightly. “The situation is not very optimistic. He needs to be operated on immediately.”

“”Okay, okay, okay! Then we’ll listen to you, Miss Ye. We’ll operate immediately,”father he immediately replied. ”

“Ye Zao glanced at the two of them and continued, “But I only have a fifty percent chance that he ziteng might die on the operating table.”She never beat around the bush, and her words were very straightforward. ”

The He family’s parents were stunned.

Die on the operating table...

“”He ziteng’s condition is already very bad now. Please make a decision as soon as possible,”ye Zhuo continued. ”

“Mother he looked up at Ye Zhuo. “Miss Ye, Please! No matter what the final outcome is, my husband and I will accept it.” ”

He ziteng was already in this state.

It was better to let ye Zhuo try.

“Xu Yao said at this time, “Uncle and Auntie, do you want to reconsider? Miss Ye...” ”

50% confidence?

She saw that ye Zao did not even have a 5% confidence.

“If he ziteng died on the operating table, the He family’s parents would definitely blame her for not stopping him! ”

“Hearing this, ye Zao lowered his eyes slightly. When he saw Xu Yao’s face, he frowned. ”

Why was this person so familiar?

“Seeing the confusion on her face, mother he immediately said, “Miss Ye, this is Ziteng’s girlfriend, Xu Yao.” ”

Xu Yao.

Ye Zao suddenly remembered Xu Yao.

When did he ziteng have such bad taste?

He actually found such a person to be his girlfriend.

He was really not picky about food.

Ye Zao did not have a good impression of Xu Yao at all.

“Although ye Zao only glanced at her and did not say anything, Xu Yao still felt panic. ”

She swallowed her throat.

“Ye Zao, could it be that he had thought of something? ”

“”Have the two of you decided?”Ye Zao looked at the He family’s parents again. “There’s not much time left for you. If you hesitate for a second, he ziteng will be in danger for another second.” ”

“”I’ve decided. Miss Ye, please operate on Ziteng immediately.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly and turned to look at his assistant. “Go and inform the hospital to prepare the operating theater.”

“Alright.”The assistant nodded.

“At this moment.., mi Chen stood up and said, “Miss Ye, my surname is mi, and I’m also a doctor. “Coincidentally, I’m quite familiar with the hospital’s director. I’ll go and inform the director to arrange the best operating theater for Miss Ye, and then I’ll help Miss Ye.” ”

“There’s no need.”Ye Zao directly refused. “I never let people with evil intentions help me.”

Good and evil were written all over his face.

It was obvious that Xu Yao and Mi Chen were wearing the same pants.

Ye Zao naturally would not let such a person into the operating theater.

Evil intentions?

What did ye Zao Mean by this?

Looking down on him?

The smile on Mi Chen’s face froze at the corner of her mouth.

She really did not know what ye Zao had to be proud of!

Wasn’t he just a little good-looking? Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

He wanted to see how ye Zao would be able to borrow the operating theater and doctors from the hospital without his help.

“Without the cooperation of other doctors and operating theaters, would it work? ”

“He was good friends with the director. As long as he asked, the director would cooperate with him. ”

Ye Zao?

Ye Zao was nothing.

Just wait.

“In less than ten minutes, when that little assistant ran into a wall, ye Zao would personally ask him for help. ”

The He family’s parents were also a little confused.

Why would ye Zao say that about Mi Chen? Had Mi Chen ever offended ye Zao?

“Soon, the little assistant came back and said with a troubled expression, “Miss Ye, the hospital said that they can’t provide an operating theater...” ”

“Hearing this, Mi Chen curled her lips. He knew this would happen. ”

“Ye Zao’s expression did not change. He took out his phone from his pocket and made a call. “I, Ye Zao, Room 3106.” ”

“After saying that, she hung up the phone. ”

“Seeing how she hung up the phone without saying a word, Mi Chen’s eyes were filled with ridicule. ”

She was quite good at pretending.

He wanted to see how ye Zao would end up.

“When the time came, the scene would definitely be very interesting. ”

“Mother he immediately asked, “Miss Ye, how is it?” ”

Ye Zao’s tone was indifferent. “Don’t worry. The hospital will arrange for people to come over immediately.”

Immediately arrange for people to come over?

Who Did ye Zao think she was?

She was too arrogant and arrogant.

“A few minutes later, there was no movement in the ward, and no one from the hospital came over either. ”

“Mi chen smiled and said, “I wonder how many minutes Miss Ye is talking about! Miss Ye, if you really can’t borrow the operating theater, just say the word. I can contact my friend...” ”

“No matter what, Ye Zao had to beg him today. ”

“Thinking of this, a smug look flashed across Mi Chen’s eyes. ”

“At this moment, a group of people walked in from outside. ”

They were travel-worn.

The leader was a middle-aged man in his fifties. He wore glasses and his hair was already a little gray.

The doctor walking beside him was slightly younger.

“This was the hospital’s deputy director, Gu Haitao. ”

Gu Haitao had a very deep relationship with him.

“Seeing this, Mi Chen was very excited. She didn’t expect Gu Haitao to come personally to see him. Just as she was about to go up and greet him, she saw the middle-aged man walking in front of Gu Haitao walk directly to ye Zao, he said with incomparable respect, “Hello, Miss Ye. I’m the President of the Third People’s Hospital, Yun Jianguo. I didn’t know that Miss Ye had come to welcome you. Please forgive me!” ”
