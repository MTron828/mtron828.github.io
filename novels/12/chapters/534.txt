“Chapter 535: 135: sister-protecting maniac, unexpected gay, face-slapping Feng Xianxian! 5”

“If she continued to act like this, sooner or later, something bad would happen. ”

“Old Mrs. Lin was already very angry. After hearing Wu Mei’s words, she was so angry that she almost jumped up. ”

Ye Shu!

It was all ye Shu’s fault!

Ye Shu was a troublemaker!

“Before ye Shu came, Lin Jincheng was a good son, Lin Ze was a good grandson, and Wu Mei was also a good daughter-in-law. Now that ye Shu came, everything changed. ”

Old Mrs. Lin was so angry that she wanted to slap Wu Mei. She clenched and loosened her hands.

“Wu Mei had two younger brothers, each of whom was tall and strong. ”

“Moreover, the Wu family’s family background was not bad, so she really did not dare to hit Wu Mei. ”

“Seeing Old Mrs. Cen’s expression change again and again, Wu Mei sighed and said, “Mom, that’s all I have to say. You should think about whether this is the case or not! I’ll go over first.” ”

“After saying that, Wu Mei turned around and walked toward ye Shu, then joined in the conversation between Ye Shu and the others. ”

“Zhao shuning had been paying attention to what was happening over there. When he saw Wu Mei walking toward ye Shu again.., zhao shuning frowned and said, “Sister-in-law, what’s going on? Others are smarter the more they live, but she’s getting smarter the more she lives! If she wants to curry favor with such a person, does she really think that ye Shu can stay with Jin city for the rest of her life?” ”

The position of the matriarch of the Lin family would not belong to Feng Qianhua sooner or later!

How long could a mistress like ye Shu stay with Lin Jin City?

“Feng Qianhua smiled and said, “Fourth sister-in-law, don’t be angry. Look, I’m not even angry.” ”

“”It’s also because you have a good heart.”Zhao shuning continued, “If it were me, I would slap her with my big mouth! When you look at our Qingxuan, it’s like a mouse seeing a cat when you look at me! If I say one thing, he won’t dare to say two!” ”

“Feng qianhua sighed, “That’s why I say, fourth sister-in-law, you’re the person I envy the most.” ”

“Zhao shuning was indeed lucky. She was a woman who couldn’t have children, yet her husband still treated her like a treasure. ”

“Most importantly, Old Lady Lin never picked on Zhao shuning. She even suggested that the couple adopt a child. ”

It was a pity.

“Back then, Feng Qianhua didn’t take a liking to Lin Qingxuan. ”

“Otherwise, would Zhao shuning even have a chance? ”

Cen Shaoqing was outside in the cold wind for a long time before he walked into the banquet hall.

“When she saw Cen Shaoqing enter, the hatred in Feng Xianxian’s eyes instantly turned into adoration as she looked at him with sparkling eyes. ”

Feng Xianxian had a strong premonition.

“One day, she would become the CEN family’s mistress and stand shoulder to shoulder with Cen Shaoqing. ”

“Because other than her, no one else was worthy of Cen Shaoqing! ”

“Thinking of this, Feng Xianxian’s eyes flashed with a determined light. ”

“After the banquet ended, Cen Shaoqing originally wanted to find an opportunity to speak to ye Zao alone, but Lin Ze had always been by ye Zao’s side. He did not have the chance to get in touch with ye Zao at all. ”

“As long as he took one more look at Ye Zao, Lin Ze would immediately block in front of ye Zao. ”

It was as if he was some kind of man-eating monster.

Cen Shaoqing laughed bitterly.

“He had always been in a high position. No matter where he went, he was always respected. As long as he took one more look at something he liked, someone would immediately give it to him with both hands. ”

This was the first time someone had treated him like a thief.

Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads in his right hand and took out his phone from his pocket with his left hand. He found a message for ye Zao.

“Old Mrs. Cen raised her head to look at Cen Shaoqing, then looked at ye Zao, who was standing not far away with Lin Ze to send the guests off. She said in puzzlement, “We’re going back soon. Aren’t you going to talk to your wife?” ”

Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads. “There might be some misunderstanding between Ah Ze and me.”

“Old Mrs. Cen narrowed her eyes. The past that had been buried in the past suddenly surged into her mind, “I’ve already said that one should keep a low profile, be arrogant for a while, and pursue one’s wife to the crematorium! So what? I was right, right? I think you’re just a failure. You’re nothing but a sand sculpture!” ”

Cen Shaoqing was also very regretful.

“If he had known that one day, he would have called Lin Ze Brother. ”

“Then, he would have definitely treated Lin ze as his ancestor back then. ”

It was too late to say anything now.

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Come with me.” ”

Cen Shaoqing followed Old Mrs. Cen’s footsteps.

The two of them walked in front of ye Zhuo and Lin Ze.

“Old Mrs. Cen grabbed ye Zhuo’s hand. “Yezi, Shaoqing and I will go back first. When you and Ah Ze have time, remember to visit my place. When the time comes, let Shaoqing come and pick you up!” ”

“Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Okay, Grandma Cen.” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen grabbed Lin Ze’s hand again, “Look at how much ah ze looks like Yezi!”! “Oh right, Ah Ze, I heard from your grandma that you like surfing a lot, right?”? “Shaoqing also likes surfing a lot. He used to be a surfing expert!”! “Everyone calls him the little white dragon in the waves. If there’s time, you young people can go out together and have some fun. How about next week?”? What do you think?” ”
