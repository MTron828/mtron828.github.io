Translator: 549690339

Was this really the ye Zao that she knew in the past?

“Mu Yourong raised her head to look at ye Zao, her eyes filled with humiliation. “Sister Ye Zao, I wholeheartedly treat you as my sister. Don’t you think that this is a little too much?” ”

“Ye Zao crossed his arms across his chest. “Am I the one that’s too much, or are the two of you too much? Miss Mu, since your parents did not teach you what it meant to not persuade others to be kind without experiencing their hardships, then I can only do it for you today!”! ”

“After saying this, ye Zao lowered his eyes to look at mu yourong and continued, “The weather is getting hotter and hotter. Miss Mu, remember to drink less green tea and more boiled water.” ”

The other people at the side also reacted at this time.

“Why do I feel that what ye Zao said makes sense!”

“You are not alone!”

“It seems that Mu Yourong is not as simple as she appears on the surface!”

“I suddenly realized that ye Zao is quite cute.”

Hearing everyone’s words.

Mu Yourong was so angry that her face turned pale.

But she could not help but suppress the anger in her heart!

Little Slut!

“Ye Zao, this little slut! ”

How would she dare?

“Ye Zao greeted Mr. Embert and went to the bathroom, preparing to clean up the wine stains on his dress. ”

“Just as he walked to the bathroom door, he was stopped by a young woman. “Excuse me, is this Miss Ye?” ”

“I am.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“The young woman handed him an exquisite packaging bag. “Miss Ye, my name is Anna! This is the gown that master five specially asked me to prepare for you.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows.

“Yes.”Anna nodded.

Ye Zhuo took the bag. “Then I won’t stand on ceremony. Help me thank him.”

“Okay.”

Ye Zhuo walked to the bathroom to change his clothes.

“When he came out, Anna was still standing in front of the bathroom door. ”

“”Miss Ye, just give me the dress you changed into. I’ll get someone to clean it for you.” ”

“Ye Zhuo held the handbag. “There’s no need to go through so much trouble. I’ll bring it back and wash it myself. By the way, Where’s your fifth master? Take Me to see him.”After wearing other people’s clothes, he should thank her personally. ”

“Come with me.”

Anna guided ye Zhuo to the high-class member area of the hotel.

It was different from the noisy first floor.

“With the carpet under his feet, it was so quiet that not a single sound could be heard. ”

“After turning a corner, he saw Cen Shaoqing standing at the handrail on the third floor. From his angle, he could see everything that happened in the banquet hall on the first floor. ”

He just stood there with his hands on the handrail.

Overlooking the first floor.

“There was clearly no expression on the exquisite side of his face, but he was like a God who ruled over all things. Everything was under his control. ”

“Thank you for your clothes.”Ye Zhuo walked directly to his side.

“Hearing this, Cen Shaoqing looked back slightly. ”

He saw ye Zhuo who had changed his clothes standing beside him.

It was a white one-shouldered gown.

The design of the one-shouldered gown just revealed the beautiful collarbone.

The design of the pinching waist made the already slender waist look even more beautiful.

It made people want to stretch out their hands to measure it.

“The hem of the skirt was decorated with tiny diamonds. At this moment, under the illumination of the lights, these diamonds were emitting a dazzling light. ”

Under normal circumstances.

“With so many diamonds on the dress, an ordinary person would not be able to suppress it. After all, diamonds were too dazzling. It was easy for them to steal the halo of others. ” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“However, she was more dazzling than diamonds! ”

“In contrast to her, the diamonds seemed to have lost their luster. ”

This dress was more suitable for her than CEN Shaoqing had imagined.

“It’s just a dress. You’re welcome.”Cen Shaoqing’s tone was indifferent.

He had witnessed the entire process from the top.

He had originally thought that ye Zhuo would definitely suffer a loss.

“After all, public opinion was overwhelming! ”

“But no one had expected that not only did she not suffer a loss, she had even caused mu yourong to suffer a loss. ”

Her style of handling matters was not at all like that of a nineteen-year-old girl. Damn

Ye Zhuo placed both hands on the railing and looked at the first floor. “The scenery here is not bad. You sure know how to find a place.”

“Fifth brother! So You’re really here? Why Don’t you go down and take a look? Mu...”

Li Qiandong ran over while panting.

“When he saw ye Zhuo standing beside Li Qiandong, he was stunned. “M-god?” ”

“Mr. Li.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

It was really ye Zhuo!

Li Qiandong was astonished.

Why was Ye Zhuo with Cen Shaoqing?

Moreover...

Li Qiandong’s expression was very complicated.

“He could tell that Li Qiandong and Cen Shaoqing had something to say, so ye Zhuo did not stay here any longer. He continued, “Fifth brother, I’ll go to the first floor first then.” ”
