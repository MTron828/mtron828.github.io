Chapter 78: 072: Face-smacking! In the Burning Business Empire, Lin Shasha recognized the scumbag and had an abortion 7

It was impossible!

“Nana!”Ye Shu raised his voice, “I’m not familiar with this lady, please ask her to leave!”

“Coming.”Bai nana jogged over.

Mother Zhang refused to leave, “Sister Ye Shu, we are all relatives, how can you turn against us? Even if you don’t Give Me Face, you have to give Shasha face...”

Ye Shu frowned slightly and turned to look at Boss Yang. “The shop is too noisy. Why Don’t we go to your company to sign the contract?”

Boss Yang nodded. “Okay.”

Mother Zhang quickly caught up to Ye Shu.

“Sister ye Shu!”

Ye Shu ignored mother Zhang and directly got into boss Yang’s car.

Watching the black car fly away, mother Zhang was so angry that she stomped her feet!

Her 100,000 yuan!

If she had known that ye Shu was so rich, she would not have offended ye Shu in the Lin Family!

Now, she could only ask Zhang Qiang to look for Lin Sha.

She could ask Lin Sha to look for ye Shu.

If Lin Sha wanted to marry into their family, she had to ask ye Shu to give them the two shops to decorate!

Otherwise, Lin Sha would never be able to marry into their family.

That’s right!

And the secret recipe!

She had to get Lin Sha to get ye Shu’s secret recipe.

Thinking of this, mother Zhang was not in a hurry.

She went home to find Zhang Qiang and told him about these two things.

Zhang Qiang could not contact Lin Sha, so he went to the Lin family to find her.

The Lin family’s parents went out to work, and it was Lin Sha who opened the door. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Seeing that it was Zhang Qiang, Lin Sha’s face was expressionless. “What are you doing here?”

Zhang Qiang said, “Sha Sha, you blocked my wechat and mobile number?”

“Yes.”Lin Sha continued, “Zhang Qiang, let’s break up.”

Zhang Qiang smiled and said, “Sha Sha, stop joking!”! “Also, my mother also knows that you blocked my phone and wechat. She is very angry now. “However, my mother said that as long as you go to Ye Zao’s house and ask her mother to hand over their shop to our company to renovate, my mother will forgive you.”

The corners of Lin Sha’s mouth curled into a mocking smile.

Who Did Zhang Qiang really think he was.

She was really stupid in the past.

She had actually been together with such a scum for so many years.

Disgusting.

Really Disgusting.

“I’ve already aborted the child,”Lin Sha continued, “Zhang Qiang, we have no relationship anymore.”

What?

Zhang Qiang’s face turned pale.

“Shasha, you’re joking, right?”

Lin Shasha wanted to marry into their family so badly, how could she bear to abort the child?

“I’m not joking with You, Zhang Qiang. From now on, you and I will go back to our old ways and never see each other again!”After saying this, Lin Shasha directly closed the door.

“Bang –”

Only then did Zhang Qiang realize that Lin Shasha was not joking.

She was serious.

What should he do now?

Zhang Qiang was really panicking.

He kept knocking on the Lin family’s door. “Shasha, can you open the door? Shasha...”

Hearing the knocking on the door, Lin Shasha frowned and dialed the property management number.

Not long after, a few tall and strong security guards appeared and took Zhang Qiang away.

Zhang Qiang had no choice but to go home and find mother Zhang.

His mother had just been through a lot with Ye Shu, and when she heard the news, she was even angrier.

Little B * Tch!

Just because she had ye Shu’s support, she threw a tantrum for her to see!

Did she really think that she was afraid of her?

His mother did not think that Lin Sha had really aborted the child, “Don’t Panic! She’s just scaring you! This little B * tch, she really knows what’s good for her! You Don’t have to contact her anymore. When she’s pregnant, she’ll naturally contact you!”

Hearing that, Zhang Qiang was relieved. He waited patiently for Lin Sha’s belly to grow bigger before taking the initiative to look for him.

Time passed very quickly. In the blink of an eye, more than a month had passed.

During this one month, ye Zao not only developed the chip that could adjust the temperature of the clothes, he also registered a company.

ZY Technology Co. , Ltd. .

The main products were clothes that could adjust the temperature and high-tech smart products.

Ye Zao did not plan to take care of the company. Instead, he was going to hire a professional president and entrust the company to the professional president.

Today was the day that ye Zao asked the professional president to meet him.

The other party’s surname was Zhao and his full name was Zhao Yang. He was a highly educated overseas returnee.

The two of them agreed to meet at the Royal Cafe.

When ye Zao went, a young man was already sitting at the window seat that they had agreed on.

He was wearing a suit and a pair of gold-rimmed glasses.

Ye Zao looked at his phone and walked directly to the other party. “Hello, Mr. Zhao, right?”
