“At a time like this, what could she do even if she was anxious? ”

“Bai Mo looked around and continued, “Where are Lin Ze and the others?” ”

“Over there.”

“Bai Yuanyuan looked in the direction Bai Mo had looked and continued, “Bai Jingshu is really shameless. It’s one thing for her to steal a man, but now she’s openly flaunting her affection in front of you!” ”

How did Lin Ze get together with Bai Jingshu? Did Bai Jingshu not know?

Bai Mo sighed. “It’s my own fault. I shouldn’t have rejected Lin ze back then.”

“”Now that things have happened, don’t say things that can’t change reality,”Bai Yuanyuan continued. “You can’t back down now. You’ve already missed out once. This time, you must seize the opportunity!” ”

“Okay.”Bai Mo nodded.

“After that, Bai Mo continued, “I’m afraid that Lin Ze’s heart has been broken.” ”

“After all, she had hurt Lin ze too deeply! ”

“Judging from Lin Ze’s behavior, he was very concerned about what had happened before. ”

“Don’t be afraid.”Bai Yuanyuan patted Bai Mo’s hand. “True love will not be forgotten so easily. Lin Ze is angry with you and giving you a hard time because he still has you in his heart!”

“Really?”Bai Mo’s eyes lit up when he heard Bai Yuanyuan’s words.

“Bai Yuanyuan nodded. “Of course it’s true! Haven’t you heard of a saying? It only takes three minutes to fall in love with someone, but it takes a lifetime to forget someone.” ”

How long had Bai Mo and Lin Ze been together?

How could Lin Ze Forget Bai Mo so quickly?

It was impossible!

“Bai Mo felt that what Bai Yuanyuan said made a lot of sense, and her gloomy mood instantly brightened up. ”

“After all, the reason why Lin Ze ignored her and didn’t give her face was because he liked her and was angry with her. ”

“As long as Lin Ze loved her deeply, he still had a chance. ”

“Bai Yuanyuan looked at Bai Mo., then, she said, “Mo Mo, if I Were You, I wouldn’t be in a hurry to be sad! The one who should be in a hurry should be Bai Jingshu! Who the hell is Bai Jingshu? If I were her, I would quit on my own. Why do I have to be a third wheel here to annoy people?” ”

This person who didn’t have a discerning eye would never have a discerning eye no matter what.

“”Mm.”Bai Momo nodded. “Yuanyuan, you’re absolutely right.” ”

“Bai Yuanyuan continued, “Are we still going to watch the movie?” ”

“”I don’t think so,”Bai Mo said. ”

She wasn’t interested in the movies. She just wanted to go with Lin Ze.

“Why not?”Bai Yuanyuan asked.

Bai Mo sighed. “Isn’t it a little inappropriate?”

“”What’s inappropriate about it?”Bai Yuanyuan continued, “Mo Mo, let me tell you. Not only are we going, we have to pick the same scenes as Bai Jingshu and the others! “You want Bai Jingshu to feel a sense of danger. It’s best if you can make her quit on her own.” ”

“Bai Mo continued, “It should be impossible for her to quit on her own.” ” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“As long as Bai Jingshu had some discerning eyes, she would not have tangled with Lin Ze until now. After all, she was the one who knew Lin ze first. ”

“Right now, she could only snatch Lin ze back from Bai Jingshu! ”

She wanted to let Bai Jingshu know what it felt like to be interfered with.

“Thinking of this, Bai Mo’s eyes were filled with joy. ”

It was as if she had already seen Lin ze snatched back by her.

“Not long after, Lin Ze and Bai Jingshu walked in from outside. ”

“Hearing the footsteps, Bai Yuanyuan and Bai Mo immediately pretended to be chatting and laughing. ”

“Bai Yuanyuan walked forward and said with a smile, “Sister, brother-in-law, I wish you both a happy marriage and a fruitful child.” ”

“”Thank you,”Bai Jingshu continued, “I also wish you a happy life as soon as possible.” ”

“Bai Yuanyuan said, “I’m still young and not in a hurry, but Momo...” Bai Yuanyuan changed the topic and continued, “Brother-in-law, you know many people and are well-informed. If you have a suitable young man by your side, you must introduce him to Momo.” ”

“Because she was certain that Lin Ze still had Momo in his heart, her words were deliberately said for Lin Ze to hear. ”

“She had thought that Lin Ze would decline tactfully. After all, no man was willing to hand over the woman he loved. ”

“However, Lin ze nodded and said, “Okay, I will definitely keep an eye out for second sister.” ”

“Bai Yuanyuan was stunned. Beside her, Momo was also stunned. ”

Could it be that their relationship could only end here?

“Bai Yuanyuan quickly reacted and smiled. “Then, brother-in-law, you must remember this. You Can’t be perfunctory.” ”

“Alright.”Lin Ze nodded.

“At this moment, elder Bai walked out from inside. “It’s time to eat. Ah Ze Jingshu, Mo Mo Yuanyuan, come in and eat.” ”

“”Coming,”Bai Jingshu said loudly. ”

“She walked in front with Lin Ze, while Bai Mo and Bai Yuanyuan followed behind. ”

Bai Mo was still a little bothered by what Lin Ze said just now.

“Bai Yuanyuan comforted her in a low voice, “Momo, Lin Ze just wanted to scare you. Don’t worry, he won’t really introduce you to someone.” ”

“Really?”Bai Mo asked.

“Of course!”Bai Yuanyuan nodded.

“Soon, they arrived at the dining hall. ”

Elder Bai asked the kitchen to prepare a large table of dishes. The air was filled with a seductive fragrance.

Bai Mo and Bai Yuanyuan were not used to eating such things.

“However, Lin Ze was present today. In order to leave a good impression on Lin Ze, the two of them could only grit their teeth and eat. ”

“After dinner, Lin Ze and Bai Jingshu went to watch a movie. ”

“Bai Yuanyuan pulled Bai mo and said, “Brother-in-law, can you give us a ride?” ”

“”It might not be convenient,”Lin ze directly refused. ”

“When elder Bai heard this, he chuckled and said, “Momo, Yuanyuan, I’ll get old Zhang to send the two of you.” ”

Elder Bai had yet to see Bai Mo and Bai Yuanyuan’s intentions.

“Bai Mo smiled and nodded. “Thank you, grandfather.” ”

“When they arrived at the cinema, Bai Mo wanted to buy tickets for the same movie as Bai Jingshu, but she was told that the cinema had been booked. ”

Who else could have booked the cinema?

It was obvious that it was Lin Ze.

Bai Mo was really sad and very sad.

“Bai Yuanyuan patted her shoulder and asked, “Are Bai Jing and Lin Ze going back to Earth soon?” ”

“”I think so,”Bai Mo said. ”

“Bai Yuanyuan narrowed her eyes and said, “You’re going too.” ”

“Me?”Bai Mo pointed at herself in surprise.

“Yeah.”Bai Yuanyuan nodded. “You must go with them at such a critical time. You mustn’t make any mistakes.”

“Whenever Bai Mo thought of Earth, she would frown in disgust. ”

“Lin Ze is going to take over the Shangguan family anyway. Why Don’t I go to Galaxy F directly?”Bai Mo said.
