“Mario narrowed his eyes. “It’s possible, but it only shrinks its body when it’s in danger.” ”

“Joanna nodded. “That’s right. After all, the exotic beasts have been with you for a long time. They’re influenced by your thoughts and don’t want to scare ordinary people, which is why they shrink their bodies. Why don’t we get out of the car and have a look?” ”

Mario thought about it and it made sense.

“After all, he had tamed the exotic beasts for such a long time. It was normal for the exotic beasts to be influenced by him and subconsciously want to protect Earth. ”

Mario got out of the car with Qiao Na.

“Qiao na followed the GPS and walked to a house. “Doctor, this is the place.” ”

“This house?”Mario asked.

Joanna nodded. “Yes.”

Mario looked at the two bodyguards behind him. “Go in.”

The bodyguards immediately pushed the door open and entered.

“Seeing that nothing had happened to the two bodyguards, Mario heaved a sigh of relief and followed them in. ”

“The owner of the house had long moved away. The house was empty, so quiet that only the sound of their footsteps could be heard. ”

“”Lucy, Lucy!”Mario immediately called out loudly. ”

It was Mario who had given Lucy the name of the Strange Beast.

“The others also called out for Lucy, but there was still no response. ”

Mario turned to look at Joanna. “Is Lucy really here?”

“Lucy looked at the GPS watch and continued, “Let’s go upstairs first. The GPS shows that she is in a room on the second floor.” ”

“Alright.”Mario still let the bodyguard go up first.

“There were three rooms on the second floor. Joanna continued, “Go to the third room on the left.” ”

The bodyguard immediately pushed open the door.

“He had thought that he would be able to see the strange beast once he pushed open the door, but... ”

There was nothing.

The room was empty. There was nothing in it.

Joanna walked in and frowned slightly. “How Strange!”

The hope in Mario’s eyes disappeared in an instant. “Lucy! Lucy!”

There were a few cabinets at the side. Joanna walked over and opened the door.

“However, the cabinets were also empty. ”

“At this moment, Joanna’s gaze suddenly landed on a doll in the corner of the cabinet. ”

It was a very popular design from a few years ago. It was somewhat cute.

“However, no matter how Joanna looked at it, she felt that it was strange. ”

“Joanna gulped and reached out to pick up the doll. The moment she picked it up, Joanna felt that something was very wrong. ”

“This doll was very heavy, as if it had just been washed and not dried, but its surface was dry. ”

“Ah!”

“At this moment, a scream suddenly appeared in the air. ”

Joanna immediately turned around and saw that Mario’s secretary was looking at her with a terrified expression.

“To be precise, he was looking at the doll in her hand. ”

“Just as Joanna was about to speak, the expressions of the others beside her also became terrified. ”

It was extremely terrifying.

“What’s Wrong?”Joanna asked.

“”The, the floor...”the secretary said with a pale face. ”

Qiao na looked down and her pupils dilated. She was so scared that she threw away the doll in her hand.

She saw that several eyeballs had been dug out from the floor.

They were stained with blood.

“Obviously, these eyeballs had fallen from the doll. ”

Patter —

“At this moment, a piece of metal fell on the floor with a crisp sound. ”

“Chip!”

“The deputy minister was used to bloody scenes, so he didn’t think much of it. Bending down to pick up the chip on the ground, he raised his head to look at Qiao Na. “Miss Qiao Na, is this the chip?” ”

“Qiao na received the chip with a trembling hand. Enduring the nausea in her body, she said, “Yes, it’s this.” ”

This chip had clearly been installed into the body of the exotic beast. How could it appear together with these eyeballs at this moment.

Could it be...

“Joanna suddenly thought of something and raised her head to look at Mario. “Doctor, these, these eyeballs should belong to those people who were on night duty last night.” ”

“Hearing this, Mario was also given a fright. ”

He had always thought that he could control the exotic beast...

Never Had he thought that this day would come.

What should he do now...

“If these eyeballs were really those people on the night shift last night, it meant that the exotic beast really couldn’t be controlled anymore. ”

“Thinking up to this point, Mario immediately looked at his secretary. “Quick! Quickly inform Ham and prepare more potash!” ”

“As long as he had potash in hand, he would be able to control the exotic beast. ”

“With this in mind, Mario calmed down slightly. ”

Things weren’t at the point of no return.

“Alright.”The secretary nodded and immediately contacted the base headquarters.

“After the headquarters received the news, they immediately began to prepare a large amount of potassium carbonate. ”

“Mario lit up a cigarette, his mind in a mess. ”

He didn’t know what to do.

“Joanna continued, “Doctor, don’t be anxious. Perhaps things aren’t as bad as you think.” ”

“What do you mean?”Mario asked.

“Joanna replied, “The exotic beasts are huge. Even if they shrink in size, they won’t return to their single cell state. If the exotic beasts were really out of control, the various regions wouldn’t be as peaceful as they are now.” ”

“Mario narrowed his eyes and turned to look at Joanna, “So what you mean is?” ”

“”The exotic beast might have self-destructed,”Joanna said. ”

“Self-destructed?”Mario asked.

“Joanna nodded. “Yes. If it hadn’t self-destructed, it wouldn’t have been so quiet.” ”

“The L continent wasn’t that big. No matter where the exotic beast hid, it would be discovered by others. However, there was still no news of it. ”

“But how do you explain those eyes?”Mario asked.

“From a certain point of view, Mario actually didn’t wish for the Exotic Beasts to disappear. ”

“After all, he still needed to make use of the exotic beasts to create a perpetual motion machine. ”

“Right now, everyone on Earth was waiting to see him make a fool of himself. If he didn’t come up with anything, wouldn’t he be sending himself to the door for everyone to slap his face? ”

No Way.

Mario narrowed his eyes. He had to find the exotic beast!

“At this moment, Mario’s phone suddenly rang. Mario took out his phone and swiped it to answer the call. It was unknown what was said on the other end of the phone, but Mario’s expression suddenly became lively. “Really?” ”

“A moment later, Mario put away his phone and looked at Qiao Na. “Let’s go back!” ”

“Seeing how he was doing, Qiao na asked curiously, “Doctor, did something happen?” ”

“Mario continued, “Lucy has already gone back!” ”

Gone back?

Qiao na frowned slightly. Why did she feel that something wasn’t right.

Mario walked out excitedly. “Let’s hurry back!”

“Although Qiao na felt that it was strange, she didn’t think too much about it. She turned around and followed Mario’s footsteps. ”

“Before long, the car stopped at the entrance of the base. ”

Mario jogged all the way back to the laboratory. “Where’s Lucy?”

“”Doctor, you’re finally back. She’s over here. Follow me.”The assistant came to Mario’s side. ”

Mario followed the assistant’s footsteps and the two of them came to the west side of the laboratory.

The exotic beast had indeed returned.

“At this moment, the exotic beast was leisurely playing with fire in a special cage. ”

“When it saw Mario, the exotic beast seemed to recognize him. It immediately stood up and let out an excited roar. ”

“Lucy!”

Mario was very excited.

“However, despite his excitement, Mario still felt that something was wrong. ”

The exotic beast seemed to have changed a lot.

“Although it still had three heads, it just felt different. ”

“Are You Lucy?”Mario asked.

The exotic beast immediately nodded.

Mario frowned slightly and turned to look at his assistant. “Did it come back on its own?”

“Yes.”The assistant nodded.
