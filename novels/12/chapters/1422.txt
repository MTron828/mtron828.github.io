“Half an hour later, an urgent police siren sounded from downstairs of the hotel. ”

Xie wanqiu was pushed into the 120 emergency ambulance.

“Zheng Wanyin was crying as she sent a video to Zhou Zuolong, “Grandpa, Grandma swallowed an entire bottle of sleeping pills. What should we do? Please believe her. She really hasn’t done anything to let you down. She’s already in this state, yet you still don’t believe her innocence? “Grandma was really wronged!” ”

“After a video was sent, Zhou Zuolong still did not reply. ”

“The ambulance was very fast. In less than ten minutes, they arrived at the hospital. Xie wanqiu was pushed into the emergency room as she wished. ”

“Zheng Wanyin continued to send the video. “Grandpa, Grandma was pushed into the emergency room. I’m so scared by myself. Can you please come and see Grandma?” ”

“However, there was still no reply from the other side. ”

“With no other choice, Zheng Wanyin could only call Zhou Zuolong. However, as soon as the call was connected, it was hung up by the other side. ”

“”Yinyin, how is it? Did Zhou Zuolong pick up the call?”Xie rongle asked anxiously. ”

“Zheng Wanyin shook her head. “No, I have a feeling that things are really not looking good this time...” ”

“”That won’t happen. That won’t happen. Zhou Zuolong loves his aunt so much. Now that his aunt is in such a state, he definitely won’t ignore it! Maybe when he saw his aunt in such a state, he would immediately faint from anxiety. Let’s Wait a little longer, wait a little longer!” ”

“If Zhou Zuolong was determined to sever all ties with Xie Wanqiu, then what would she do? ”

How could she still marry Zhou Jinbei!

“With such a good husband like Zhou Jinbei in front of her, how could those country bumpkins from her hometown be worthy of her? ”

“In the current situation, other than waiting, Zheng Wanyin had no other choice. ”

“Two hours later, Xie Wanqiu was pushed out of the emergency room. ”

“Zheng Wanyin immediately went up to her. “Grandma, Are You Alright?” ”

“Xie wanqiu was wearing an oxygen tube and looked very weak. “I’m-I’m fine. Is Zhou Zuolong Here?”It was not a pleasant experience to have her stomach pumped! In addition, Xie Wanqiu was getting older. After a round of torment, Xie Wanqiu almost lost half of her life. ”

“However, none of this was important. ”

The most important thing now was Zhou Zuolong!

Everything she had done was worth it in exchange for Zhou Zuolong’s sympathy.

Zheng Wanyin shook her head. “He didn’t come.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

He didn’t come?

“Xie Wanqiu’s expression was already ugly to begin with. After hearing those words, the last bit of light on her face disappeared without a trace. ”

“Zheng Wanyin quickly comforted her. “Grandma, don’t worry. Maybe Grandpa didn’t see it. He’ll definitely come and visit you tomorrow!” ”

“At this moment, Xie Wanqiu could only comfort herself in her heart. ”

Tomorrow.

Zhou Zuolong would definitely come tomorrow.

Zhou Zuolong valued her more than his own life. How could he just sit by and do nothing?

Very soon.

The next day arrived.

“The next morning, the first thing Xie Wanqiu did when she woke up was Zheng Wanyin. “Yinyin, has Zhou Zuolong come?” ”

“No.”Zheng Wanyin shook her head.

Why wasn’t he here yet?

“Xie rongle said with a sad face, “From yesterday until now, he has been said to have shown up. Zhou Zuolong hasn’t even replied to Yinyin’s message. He can’t really be determined to cut ties with you, right?” ”

“”Aunty, what are you talking about?”Zheng wanyin said, “Grandpa loves Grandma so much. He will definitely come! I believe in him!” ”

“At that moment, there was a knock on the door outside the ward. ”

Who was knocking on the door?

It was definitely Zhou Zuolong!

The three people’s eyes lit up.

Zheng Wanyin was so happy that she cried. “I knew Grandpa would definitely come!”

“I’ll go open the door!”Xie rongle ran to open the door.

“When he saw the person standing outside the door clearly, the smile on Xie Rongle’s face froze at the corner of his mouth. ”

“He saw that the person who came outside was not Zhou Zuolong at all, but a young man in a suit and tie. ”

“May — May I know who you are?”

“The young man looked up at Xie Rongle. “Hello, May I know if Ms. Xie Wanqiu is staying in this ward?” ”

“Yes.”Xie rongle nodded.

“The young man continued, “I’m Mr. Zhou Zuolong’s –” ”

“Before the young man could finish his sentence, he was interrupted by Xie Rongle. “You were sent by my uncle, right? Come in, come in, my aunt is inside!” ”

The young man followed Zheng Wanyin’s footsteps.

“Xie rongle said, “Aunt, uncle has sent someone to see you!” ”

Sent someone to see her?

“Hearing this, Xie Wanqiu was a little unhappy. ”

Why didn’t Zhou Zuolong come himself?

What did he mean by sending someone to get rid of her?

Just wait.

“After this incident, she would definitely give Zhou Zuolong a good beating. ”

“This is my aunt.”Xie rongle took people to the ward.
