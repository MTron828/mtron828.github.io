“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Isn’t this to give you a surprise? Oh right, let me introduce you to my boyfriend, Cen Shaoqing.” ”

“The last time she went to the capital, Lin Sha had thought that there was definitely a chance between the two of them. She did not expect them to be together. ”

It was simply the speed of light!

“Lin Sha looked at Cen Shaoqing with a smile on the corner of her mouth. “Hello, brother-in-law!” ”

“”Sister Shasha.”Although Lin Shasha was younger than Cen Shaoqing, Cen Shaoqing could only follow behind ye Zao and call her sister. ”

“Zhou Yuelian stood up and said, “Shasha, stay at home with Zao Zao and Cen. I’ll go out and buy some food.” ”

“Okay.”Lin Shasha nodded. “You go now.”

“Zhou Yuelian bought a lot of food. In addition to chicken, duck, fish, and meat, she also bought a lot of seafood. ”

The whole meal was a feast for the guests and the host.

“At around nine o’clock in the evening, Ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing went back together. ”

“Although it was not the first time they were living under the same roof, Cen Shaoqing was still a little excited. ”

“The next day, Ye Zhuo began to deal with Xu Lanyue’s matter. ”

“Xu Lanyue had already retired. Apart from dancing in the square, she took care of her grandson every day. Her life was very comfortable. ” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Ye Zhuo did not hide Xu Lanyue’s matter from Cen Shaoqing.

“Hearing this, Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly. “Leave this person to me to handle.” ”

“Ye Zhuo shook his head slightly. “I know you can definitely handle it, but I prefer to handle it myself.” ”

“”Alright, then I’ll accompany you.” ”

“Okay.”

“When Ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing arrived at Xu Lanyue’s house, Xu Lanyue was just about to go out and play mahjong. ”

“When she saw ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing, Xu Lanyue frowned and asked, “Who are you looking for?” ”

Ye Zhuo smiled faintly. “I’m Looking for you.”

“Xu lanyue continued, “Do I know you?” ”

“Ye Zhuo’s red lips parted slightly. “It’s fine if you don’t know me. It’s fine as long as I know you. I’m Ye Zhuo, the Ye Zhuo who was swapped by you and your niece back then.” ”

“Hearing that, Xu Lanyue’s face turned pale instantly. ”

The past that had already been hidden deep in her heart surged into her heart again.

“But she still tried her best to calm her emotions. “What, what are you talking about? I don’t understand?”The child that she swapped back then, Feng Qianhua had fed her the drug piperazine to control mental illness before the swap. ”

“Logically speaking, that child should be an idiot now. ”

How could she be so smart?

No!

She must have made a mistake!

“”It’s okay if you don’t understand. I can explain it to you slowly. One by one, I’ll help you recall it one by one.”Ye Zhuo continued, “The health-preserving soup that Feng Qianhua sends my grandmother every day is also the prescription you provided, right?” ”

“”Also, your sister Xu Lanying didn’t die at all. It was you who abused your power to give her a death certificate.” ”

Xu Lanyue’s forehead was already covered in cold sweat. “I don’t know what you’re talking about!”

Xu Lanyue didn’t expect that the truth would come out one day.

“She also didn’t expect that not only was ye Zhuo not stupid, he even came to her! ”

Now.

She could only pretend that she didn’t understand.

“Nineteen years had passed. Even if ye Zao wanted to investigate, he could not find any evidence. ”

Ye Zao smiled slightly. “So you’re saying that you don’t admit that you did these things?”

“No! I didn’t do anything! You’re the one who slandered me!”

Ye Zao was not angry. He took out a stack of documents from his backpack and threw them on the coffee table. “These are the proof of your son’s embezzlement of public funds. What do you think your son will do if I hand these over to the police?”

“Before he came to look for Xu Lanyue, Ye Zhuo had already investigated everything. ”

Embezzlement?

Xu Lanyue’s eyes were filled with disbelief.

Her son had been very obedient since he was young. His grades were excellent and he had even entered a good university. How could he have embezzled public funds?

No!

He wouldn’t!

“You! You’re lying!”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “If you’re lying, just come back and ask your son. I’ll leave these things with you first. This is my phone number. Call me when you’ve thought it through! I’ll only wait for you for three days.” ”

Xu Lanyue grabbed the documents on the coffee table and wanted to tear them up.

The corners of Ye Zhuo’s mouth curled up slightly. “I have a lot of copies of these.”

Xu Lanyue’s hand suddenly stopped.

Ye Zhuo ignored Xu Lanyue and turned to look at Cen Shaoqing. “Let’s go.”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

The two of them walked out of the door together.

“For the next three days, Ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing went sightseeing in Yun Jing. ”

“Three nights later, Ye Zhuo received a call from Xu Lanyue. ”

“On the other end of the phone, Xu Lanyue was already on the verge of collapse. “What exactly are you trying to do?” ”

“Ye Zhuo’s expression remained the same. “If you want to save your son, then do as I say.” ”

“Ten minutes later, Ye Zhuo hung up the phone. ”

Cen Shaoqing came over with a piece of cut fruit. “I just bought a pineapple today. Try it and see if it’s sweet.”

“Ye Zhuo tried a piece. “It’s alright. By the way, Let’s go back the day after tomorrow.” ”

“So Soon?”Cen Shaoqing had not fully enjoyed the two of them for the past few days.

“Ye Zhuo smiled and looked at Cen Shaoqing. “We’ve already been here for five days. The day after tomorrow will be the sixth day.”If Xu Lanyue could not leave until the day after tomorrow, Ye Zhuo wanted to go back tomorrow morning. ”

“You’ve been here for so many days?”Cen Shaoqing’s hand that was holding the Buddhist beads paused.

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “What do you think?”

...

“On the third day, Ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing boarded the plane back to the capital. ”

Feng Qianhua still came over every day to deliver soup to Old Lady Lin.

“Old Lady Lin was very touched. She held Feng Qianhua’s hand and said, “Qianhua, you’re still so filial! It’s been 19 years. I’ve let both of you down!”After so many years, she had not been able to give the mother and daughter an official title. ”

“Not only did she not give them an official title, but she even allowed ye Zhuo to steal Feng Qianxian’s boyfriend. ”

“Every time she thought of this, Old Mrs. Lin felt extremely guilty. ”

“Feng Qianhua smiled and said, “It’s only right to show filial respect to you! You mustn’t feel any psychological pressure.” ”

“Old Mrs. Lin grabbed Feng Qianhua’s hand. “Qianhua, don’t worry. I’ll definitely get Ye Zhuo to return Shaoqing to Qianxian.” ”

“Feng Qianhua smiled bitterly. “Xianxian’s personality is like mine. Once she has decided on something, she won’t change her mind...” ”

Feng Qianhua had waited for Lin Jin city for nineteen years. She could not let Feng Xianxian follow Feng Qianhua’s old path.

“Hearing this, Old Madam Lin’s heart skipped a beat. She turned to look at Aunt Zhang. “Aunt Zhang, I heard that Ye Zhuo has returned. Go and get her for me!” ”

“There’s no need to call her over. I’m here.”A clear voice came from the outside.

Old Mrs. Lin looked up and saw that it was ye Zao.

“Ye Zao wasn’t the only one who had come. Ye Shu, Lin Jincheng, and Lin Ze had also come. ”

“There were four people in the family, and not a single one was missing. ”

“Old Mrs. Lin frowned slightly, “It’s good that you guys are here! I just happen to have something to say to you guys! Hurry up and let ye Zao break up with Shaoqing! As an older sister, can’t she give way to her younger sister? She clearly knew that Xianxian liked Shaoqing, yet she still had to get involved! She’s not shy, even as a grandmother, I’m embarrassed for her!” ”

“”Grandmother, we’ll talk about the unimportant things later. I have a guest who wants to see you. I hope that after you meet this guest, you can treat Aunt Feng like your own daughter.” Ye Zhuo looked up at Feng Qianhua and Aunt Zhang. “Speaking of which, this guest has some history with you two.” ”
