“Chapter 1664: 349: you, Miss Ye, or you, Miss Ye! 1”

Translator: 549690339

“Ye Zao refused to follow, so the assistant could only give up. He continued, “Miss Ye, please take care of your safety.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly and fastened his seat belt.

The assistant helped to close the cabin door.

The aircraft flew out of the aircraft carrier’s runway and soon disappeared into the ring of volcanoes in front of them.

“Where’s Miss Ye?”Yu Zifei walked out from inside and asked curiously when he did not see ye Zao.

The assistant turned to look at Yu Zifei. “Miss Ye said that she wanted to go to the front to take a look. She asked us to wait for her here.”

Yu Zifei frowned. “Miss Ye went alone?”

This was the ring of fire. It would be a little dangerous if ye Zao went alone.

“The assistant nodded. “I said I would go with Miss Ye, but she didn’t want me to go with her.” ”

“”Got it. You Go ahead and do your work,”Yu Zifei said. ”

“Okay.”The assistant walked to the side. She still had to film the geographical environment on Mars and provide vegetarian dishes for other countries.

China was the first country to land on Mars. Other countries needed to rely on the materials provided by China for scientific research.

“Yu Zifei looked at the ring of fire not far away, his eyes full of worry. ”

“A moment later, Yu Zifei seemed to remember something and called his assistant. “Fangfei!” ”

“”Team leader Yu!”His assistant, Ma Fangfei, walked out. ”

“Yu Zifei continued, “Did miss ye go that way just now?” ”

“That way.”Ma Fangfei pointed in a direction.

“Looking at the direction that Ma Fangfei was pointing in, Yu Zifei’s heart skipped a beat. “Oh no!” ”

“”What’s wrong, team leader Yu?”Ma Fangfei quickly asked. ”

Yu Zifei didn’t say anything and turned around to walk into the interior of the aircraft carrier.

“Cen he and the others were just about to come out when they saw Yu Zifei’s anxious look and asked curiously, “Old Yu, what’s wrong with you? Why are you in such a hurry!” ”

“Yu Zifei was thirty years old this year. The four brothers of Jianghe, Huhai, were older, so everyone called him old Yu. ”

Yu Zifei’s expression was a little ugly. “Miss Ye just went to the Northwest district alone.”

“”The Northwest District? What’s wrong with the Northwest District?”Cen he asked, puzzled. ”

“Cen Hai reacted at this time, and the smile on his face instantly disappeared. “There will be a chain volcanic eruption in the Northwest District in ten minutes! At that time, the volcanic magma will engulf the entire basin!” ”

“Hearing this, the air instantly became quiet! ”

The volcanic magma engulfing the entire basin was not a joke.

“One had to know that the temperature of the volcanic magma was as high as 1,300 degrees Celsius! ”

“Once the aircraft was engulfed by the magma, there was almost no chance of survival. ”

“This was ye Zhuo’s first time landing on Mars. When they heard this news, everyone was very anxious. ”

Cen Jiang frowned slightly. “Hurry up and contact Miss Ye! Tell her this news.”

“I’ll contact her!”Cen he immediately turned on the communicator.

“Soon, Ye Zao’s call was connected. ”

“Hello.”

“Hearing ye Zao’s voice, Cen he and the others heaved a sigh of relief. ”

“”Miss Ye, how are you now?”Cen he asked anxiously. ”

“Everything is fine.”Ye Zao looked at the surface of Mars through the window of the spacecraft and said concisely.

“CEN he continued, “Miss Ye, there will be a large-scale volcanic eruption in the northwest region in 10 minutes. At that time, the entire basin will be submerged. Please come back quickly!” ”

Ye Zao’s voice did not sound abnormal. “I will return to my original place in 10 minutes.”

“”Okay.”CEN he continued, “Miss Ye, let’s keep in touch. You must pay attention to your safety!” ”

“I will. You Don’t have to worry.”

“Cen Jiang continued, “Miss Ye, where are you now? I’m coming to look for you!” ”

There must be something for ye Zhuo to take the risk to go to the northwest district. It was better to have one more person to help than one person.

“”No need. Just wait here. That’s all for now.”As soon as he said that, Ye Zhuo cut off the communication. ”

“”Goodbye, Miss Ye.” ”

“Seeing that Cen Jiang had cut off the communication device, Yu Zifei asked anxiously, “What did Miss Ye Say?” ”

“Cen Jiang said, “Miss Ye doesn’t want me to go over. Let’s wait here first.” ”

Yu Zifei nodded.

Over here.

“Ye Zhuo piloted the aircraft to a very dangerous Mars belt. Through the window, he could see fiery red magma constantly erupting from the volcano’s mouth. ”

“If he was not careful, the aircraft would be hit by the sudden eruption of lava. ”

It was even scarier than the scene of a disaster movie.

Ye Zao skillfully piloted the aircraft and landed on a safe extinct volcano.
