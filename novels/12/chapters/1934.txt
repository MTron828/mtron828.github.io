“Now I can only try this method.”

“After ye Han received this order, he immediately went to the detention room. ”

“Seeing ye Han, Yi Ling’s eyes quickly lit up with hope. “Ye Han, you came to save me, right?” ”

It knew that ye Han would not betray ye Zao.

“In this world, no one was more loyal than ye Han, so how could ye Han betray him? ”

“”My Name Is Wu Han.”Ye Han looked at Yi Ling with a cold expression. “Ye Zhuo is already dead, so why are you asking for trouble?” ”

“Hearing this, the light of hope in Yi Ling’s eyes instantly disappeared. ”

It had misjudged the person.

Ye Han was a traitor!

“Traitor!”

“Ye Han continued, “Miss Qiu is a wise monarch. To be able to belong to her, you should feel honored.” ”

Honored!

Honored!

Heh.

“Yi Ling sneered and raised her head to look at Ye Han. “Ye Han, Miss Ye’s corpse isn’t even cold yet. How did you say these words? Are you still the Ye Han I know?” ”

“Speaking up to this point, Yi Ling’s face was full of self-mockery. “No, you’re no longer the Ye Han I know! You’re now Qiu Di’s Lackey! You’re indeed unworthy of the surname Ye! You’ve insulted the ye surname!” ”

“Up until now, Yi Ling still didn’t believe that Ye Han had betrayed ye Zao. ”

“But the truth told her that not only had Ye Han betrayed ye Zao, he had also betrayed her thoroughly. ”

“”Yi Ling, a wise man submits to circumstances.”Ye Han frowned coldly. “You’re not doing yourself any good like this! Eldest miss said that as long as you submit to her, she can let bygones be bygones!” ”

“”Bah! That wicked woman, Qiu Di, is she worthy?”Yi Ling said disdainfully. ”

Wicked Woman?

“When he caught these three words, Ye Han’s expression instantly changed, becoming incomparably sinister. ”

“At this moment, Yi Ling seemed to have seen the ye Han of the past. ”

At that time.

“In order to protect ye Zao, Ye Han nearly injured a life. ”

“But in the next second, Ye Han grabbed its neck. ”

“Ye Han looked at it coldly. “Eldest miss told me not to take your life. If there’s a next time, I’ll make your life worse than death!” ”

The clothes spirit smiled.

“In a moment, ye Han released it and turned to leave. ”

The clothes spirit fell to the ground and vomited a large mouthful of blood.

“Other than the pain, it was mostly hungry. ”

Very Hungry.

It had not eaten for two days.

One had to know that it used to be very gluttonous.

“Yi Ling looked at the wall of the detention room and her eyes suddenly turned red. she cried in grievance, “Sear Sear sear, Sear Sear Sear, when are you going to come and pick me up!” ”

It was so hungry.

It was so painful.

It really wanted to go back!

“Looking at Yi Ling through the monitor, the corners of autumn flute’s mouth curled up. She continued, “From today onwards, you are not allowed to give it food. Let it starve like this.” ”

The assistant was stunned. “What if she dies from hunger?”

“Hang her with the nutrient solution.”A sinister glint flashed in Autumn Flute’s eyes. “Let her neither starve to death nor be full! Let her starve until her mouth turns soft!”

This method was too cruel!

She might as well give her a quick death.

“The assistant sighed in her heart and continued, “Yes, miss. .” ”

...

Beijing.

“After the New Year’s Eve dinner, Ye Zao and his family flew kites in the courtyard. ”

“The thick snow reflected the color of the fireworks, which looked especially beautiful. ”

“Before this, Beijing had already banned fireworks for ten years. ”

“Now that the ban was suddenly lifted, the sky was extremely lively with colorful fireworks. ”

“Not only did ye Sen buy big fireworks, but he also bought a lot of fairy sticks and small fireworks. ”

Ye Zao and Little White were having a great time in the snow.

Lin Ze was in charge of lighting the fire behind the two of them.

There was also a dog jumping behind them. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“It was strange. Normal dogs were more afraid of the sound of fireworks and the sound of thunder and lightning. However, Rollie was not afraid. Instead, when he heard these sounds, he was exceptionally excited! ”

Just like now.

“After setting off the firecrackers and fireworks, little white looked at ye Zao with her chin in her hands. “Big Burning.” ”

“Yeah.”

“Little White continued, “I feel that you earthlings are really strange.” ”

“How is it strange?”Ye Zao asked.

“Little White looked at the fireworks in the sky and said somewhat speechlessly, “Isn’t the so-called New Year just a year of the Earth circling the sun? What’s there to celebrate?” ”

Little White really did not understand what the meaning of the new year was.

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Then let me ask you, do you think the New Year is fun? Are You Happy?” ”

“Yes! Happy!”Whitey nodded.

“”As long as you’re happy,”ye Zhuo continued, “Humans have worked hard for a year. If we don’t find a holiday to have fun and rest, isn’t it too hard?”? “Moreover, the new year is a traditional holiday left behind by our ancestors. It represents family reunion. For children, they can wear new clothes, eat delicious food, play with fireworks, and don’t have to do their homework. For adults, the new year can temporarily forget their worries and return home to reunite with their parents, wives, and children. In short, the New Year is a very important holiday. If you have to define it by the earth circling the star, it is not impossible. After all, you are not a human being.” ”
