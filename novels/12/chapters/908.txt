“After saying that, Lu Xiu turned around and left. ”

“Cen Yuyan looked at song Chenyu with a mocking smile on her face. “Song Chenyu, you are indeed a qualified actor. You must have worked hard to act in front of me during this period of time, right?” ”

She treated song Chenyu as her best friend.

She had almost no secrets in front of Song Chenyu.

She even tried to get Cen Shaoqing and song Chenyu together.

But what about Song Chenyu?

How did song Chenyu repay her?

Song Chenyu treated her as a fool.

“”Yuyan, things aren’t what you think! Listen to my explanation!” ”

“”There’s no need to explain.”Cen Yuyan continued, “I have eyes and I can hear too! Song Chenyu, you really make me feel disgusted! You clearly know that the person Lu Xiu likes is you, yet you still pretend to know nothing in front of me! You are a White Lotus!” ”

“Song Chenyu grabbed Cen Yuyan’s hand and cried, “Yuyan, I also didn’t know that the person Lu Xiu likes is me. I really didn’t know... you are my best friend and Best Sister. How could I Lie to You?” ”

“Now that she heard these words again, CEN Yuyan felt that it was funny and directly shook off song Chenyu’s hand. “Scram! I Won’t have a friend like you in the future! You’re not welcome at tonight’s Banquet!” ”

“After saying this, Cen Yuyan turned around and left without the slightest hesitation. ”

Song Chenyu looked at Cen Yuyan’s back and frowned tightly. A sense of crisis that she had never felt before surged into her heart.

Tonight’s incident had exceeded her expectations.

What should she do now?

She couldn’t rely on Lu Xiu anymore.

“No matter what, she couldn’t lose Cen Yuyan. ”

Song Chenyu narrowed her eyes.

“At this moment, two security personnel walked up to Song Chenyu. “I’m sorry, miss. Please leave this place in ten minutes!” ”

“Okay.”Song Chenyu tried her best to maintain a smile.

Things had already developed to this extent. She had to think of a way to make up for it.

“Under the supervision of the two security guards, Song Chenyu left the banquet venue. ”

“Cen Yuyan ran back into the room, her eyes red. ”

“Cen Yueya saw that something was wrong with her and asked in puzzlement, “Fourth Lass, what’s Wrong?” ”

“Nothing.”Cen Yuyan tried her best to hold back her tears.

“Cen Yueya did not think too much and continued, “Oh right, Have You Seen Lu Xiu? I know that you are interested in him, so I specially invited him here today!” ”

“Although Cen Yuyan was sometimes a little stupid, she was her fourth sister after all. Sisters still had to help each other. ”

Lu Xiu was indeed not bad.

“His character was good and he had the ability. As long as he could take a liking to Cen Yuyan, this was also a good fate. ”

“In fact, Cen Yuyan was very good in all aspects, except that she didn’t have an advantage in age. ”

“Fortunately, Lu Xiu was more stable. ”

“Cen Yueya smiled and patted Cen Yuyan’s shoulder. “I found someone to understand Lu Xiu. Lu Xiu is indeed a very good person. If the two of you really succeed, Mom will definitely be very happy. You should make good use of this opportunity.” ”

“Hearing this, Cen Yuyan almost cried. ”

The only people who truly cared for her were her biological sisters.

Unlike song Chenyu!

“She clearly knew that Lu Xiu’s heart belonged to someone else, yet she still deliberately let her humiliate herself in front of Lu Xiu! ”

“Cen Yuyan raised her head and looked at Cen Yueya. “Second sister, thank you. I know that you’re doing this for my own good, but I already have a boyfriend now. Didn’t mom tell you?” ”

Already have a boyfriend?

Cen Yueya looked at Cen Yuyan in surprise. “Who’s your boyfriend? Didn’t you like Lu Xiu before? Why did you change your heart so quickly?” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“CEN Yuyan continued, “This matter is more complicated. It Won’t be clear in a short time. You just need to know that I already have a boyfriend now!” ”

“Who is he? where is he from? Is he reliable?”Cen Yueya followed up with a question.

“Cen Yuyan said, “He’s not from the capital. His family background is average, but don’t worry, his character is definitely not a problem.” ”

“Cen Yueya nodded. “As long as his character is good, there’s no problem.” ”

“To reach the Cen family’s height, there was no need for any form of marriage. Therefore, family background was not important, but character was the most important. ”

“CEN Yueya added, “You should also be more careful. Don’t be deceived by others!”! “Oh right, I saw that you even brought song Chenyu over. You should be very clear about what song Chenyu is thinking. Fortunately, Grandma didn’t come tonight. Otherwise, she would definitely scold you!” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen had something urgent to attend to, so she didn’t attend Tian Tian’s birthday party. Otherwise, according to Old Mrs. Cen’s personality, she would definitely scold Cen Yuyan until she was drenched in blood. ”
