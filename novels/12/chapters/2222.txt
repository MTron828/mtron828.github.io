Shi Qingcheng nodded and looked at Cen Shaoqing.

Cen Shaoqing immediately understood and looked at ye Zao. “I’ll go to the study first.” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

Cen Shaoqing turned around and left.

“Shi Qingcheng immediately held onto ye Zao’s arm. “Zao Zao, that person from your family is quite perceptive! He’s trained quite well!” ”

“”That’s right, why don’t you take a look at who I am?”Ye Zao raised his chin slightly and said somewhat arrogantly. ”

“You’re the best! You’re still the same as when you were young!”Shi Qingcheng said.

“Ye Zao smiled slightly and continued, “Right, what do you want to tell me?” ”

“”Let’s Find a quiet place to talk,”Shi Qingcheng said. ”

“Okay.”Ye Zao followed Shi Qingcheng’s footsteps.

The two of them went to the pavilion in the garden and sat down.

“Shi Qingcheng raised her head and looked at Ye Zhuo. “Zhuo Zhuo, I asked ye Xiaohan to reply to me as soon as possible, but he seems to have forgotten about this matter now. Can you help me ask him?” ”

“Reply to what?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“Although Shi Qingcheng was usually carefree, she did not know why, but when she heard ye Zhuo’s words, her face blushed. She did not know how to answer ye Zhuo. She only said, “Zhuo Zhuo Zhuo, help me ask him. He knows.” ”

“Seeing Shi Qingcheng like this, Ye Zhuo immediately understood what she meant. He smiled and said, “Okay, I understand. I will ask him for you.” ”

“Then when will you ask?”Shi Qingcheng continued to ask.

“Ye Zhuo said, “I will ask him later.” ”

“”No,”Shi Qingcheng continued, “Zhuo Zhuo, help me ask him now.” ”

“Why are you in such a hurry?”Ye Zhuo teased.

“”Aiya, go and ask for me now!”Shi Qingcheng Hugged ye Zao’s arm and started to act coquettishly. ”

“Ye Zao couldn’t stand people acting coquettishly to her, just like how she couldn’t resist the temptation of desserts. She smiled and said, “Okay, okay, okay, I’ll go now!” ”

“Then go quickly!”

Ye Zao came to Ye Han’s office.

The door was closed.

Ye Zao stretched out his hand and knocked on the door.

Ye Han’s voice came from inside. “Come in!”

Ye Zhuo pushed the door open and entered.

“Ye Han was reading a document. When he saw ye Zhuo enter, ye Han immediately stood up from his chair. “Sis!” ”

“Are you free now?”Ye Zhuo asked.

Ye Han nodded. “Yes.”

Ye Zhuo leaned over and sat opposite ye Han.

“For some reason, when he saw ye Zhuo and ye Han, he felt a little nervous. He gulped and continued, “SIS, why are you looking for me?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly. “I was asked by someone to ask you something.”

“Asked by someone?”Ye Han was stunned. “Who?”

“Ye Zao looked at ye Han and said, “Guess.” ”

Ye Han thought about it seriously and then shook his head.

“”Qingcheng.”Ye Zao continued, “She asked me to ask you when you can reply to her!” ”

“Hearing this, ye Han immediately remembered, “I forgot! where is she now?” ”

“”In the back garden,”ye Zhuo said. ”

“I’ll go right away!”Ye Han stood up and was about to walk out of the door.

“Ye Zhuo said at this moment, “Wait a moment.” ”

“”What’s wrong, Sister?”Ye Han turned around and asked. ”

Ye Zhuo’s red lips parted slightly. “Do you have the answer in your heart?”

Ye Han nodded.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Qingcheng is a very good girl. Of course, you’re also very outstanding. “If you decide to accept her, you must shoulder the responsibility of being a man. Don’t do anything that will make her sad. “If you can’t accept her, you must reject her cleanly. Don’t drag your feet and influence her. Do you understand what I mean?” ”

“”SIS, what do you think of me and her?”Ye Han asked in return. ”

Ye Zhuo smiled faintly. “You have to ask yourself that. Others can’t give you an answer.”

“”I understand.”Ye Han nodded. “Don’t worry, I will definitely not let her be sad.” ”

Ye Han felt that there were times in his heart when he was feeling Qingcheng.

He did not mind that girls were older than her.

“”En.”Ye Zao’s eyes were indifferent. “Qingcheng is my good friend. If you dare to bully her and make her sad, I will not help her out.” ”

Ye Han nodded. “En.”

“After saying that, ye Han continued, “Then what if she bullied me?” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Then you can only blame yourself for not being capable enough. You Can’t even beat a girl.” ”

“Ye Han also laughed out loud. “Sister, then I’ll be leaving first.” ”

“Go.”

Ye Han jogged all the way towards the garden.

“Shi Qingcheng was sitting on the stone bench, her hands resting on her cheeks as she looked ahead. No one knew what she was thinking, but even when ye Han walked to her side, she did not react in time. ”

It was not until ye Han coughed lightly that Shi Qingcheng finally reacted and turned around to look at Ye Han. Her eyes instantly lit up. “You’re here!”
