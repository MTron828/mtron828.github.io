“”No matter how obedient and filial a daughter is, she will eventually get married!”The aunt continued, “Look at me, I have three children, two girls and a boy. This is the youngest son. I gave birth to him at the age of 36. Before I had a son, my mother-in-law looked down on me, men looked down on me, and they couldn’t raise their heads in front of their relatives and friends! “Ever since my son was born, they all have to look at me! “Whoever dares to make me uncomfortable, I dare to make them uncomfortable!” ”

“At this point, the aunt was extremely proud, she lowered her voice and said, “Big Sister, let me tell you something from the bottom of my heart. We women still have to have a son. Only with a son will we be able to stand tall! To tell you the truth, in order to have this son, I even gave away two daughters!” ”

Although it was already the 20th century.

But many old people still retained their old ideas.

“Only Boys could carry on the family line, and girls could only be the foil to the icing on the cake. ”

“If a woman could not give birth to a boy for her family, she would not be able to raise her head in front of others. ”

“To put it nicely, she had sent her two daughters away. ”

“In fact, she had lost them. ”

“In that era, in order to give birth to a son, there were too many people who had thrown their daughters away... ”

“Hearing this, Ye Shu looked at the aunt in surprise. ”

“Seeing ye Shu like this, the aunt sighed and looked helpless. “Sigh, I have no choice! If I don’t send them away, there will be too many children at home and I won’t be able to feed them...” ”

Ye Shu felt a little uncomfortable.

She thought of herself.

“Back then, if it wasn’t for her grandmother’s kindness to adopt her, her parents would have given her away to someone else. ”

“Unfortunately, her grandmother left early. ”

She couldn’t let the old lady enjoy a day of happiness.

“At the mention of her son, the aunt’s face was full of pride. She continued, “Fortunately, my son is good! There are more than 30 classes and more than 1,600 people in their school’s third year. He can always get into the top 1,000 in his grade. This time, he will definitely get into a good university!” ”

Ye Shu maintained a polite but awkward smile on her face.

“”Oh right, how’s Your Daughter’s results?”The Aunty continued to ask. ”

“Ye Shu replied modestly, “Average.” ”

“The aunty smiled and said, “Girls are not as smart as boys! Your Daughter’s results are average as well. Anyway, it’s useless if a girl’s education is too high. Sooner or later, she will have to get married! “It’s already good enough to have a high school education! “It’s also because the times have changed. Girls can go to school. In our era, they didn’t even go to primary school. They’re still living well! “Those two girls in my house are the same as me. They haven’t even entered primary school!” ”

Ye Shu smiled and didn’t say anything.

“Because when you talk to someone with a different outlook, everything you say is wrong. ”

“Perhaps, this was not the aunt’s fault. ”

This was the tragedy of an era.

“”Sister, What’s Your Wechat number? Let’s add each other on wechat! When my son gets into university, I’ll treat you to a wedding banquet!” ”

“”Thank you for your kind intentions, but there’s no need.”Ye Shu declined politely. ”

“The aunt looked at ye Shu and continued, “You don’t want a second child, is your man not angry? Right, the person who was standing with you just now, is he your man?” ”

“He’s my younger brother.”

“The middle-aged woman nodded. “Oh, I see! I was wondering why he looks a little like you! What About Your Man?” ”

“Ye Shu didn’t want to answer the middle-aged woman, but she still said politely, “We’re not together anymore.” ”

“Divorced?”The middle-aged woman asked in surprise.

Ye Shu didn’t explain and nodded.

“So You’re alone now?”

“Yes.”

“The aunt’s eyes rolled around. “It’s too difficult for us women. Sister, you’re still young and so beautiful. You still have to find a man. Without a man by your side, you can’t live like this.” ”

Ye Shu’s expression was normal. “The times are different now. Men and women are equal. Women can live well without men.”

“The aunt shook her head, “These words are comforting! If there are no men, the world will be doomed! Oh right, sister, I have a suitable person here who can hook you up. Do you want to consider it?” ”

“The aunt had a divorced younger brother, but she had never found a suitable one. ” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Although ye Shu had a burden, it was a good thing that the burden was a girl. ”

She was already in her third year of high school.

She could also get married now. She could take advantage of this opportunity to ask for a dowry.

This business was definitely profitable!

“”Thank you for your kindness, but I have never thought of getting married again.”Ye Shu directly refused. ”
