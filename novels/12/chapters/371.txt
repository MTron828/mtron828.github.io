She was preparing to destroy the cheat system in Mu Yourong’s body.

She was the founder of the cheat system. She knew the weakness of the cheat system.

It was just that writing the destruction program was a little troublesome.

It was not until 3:30 in the morning that ye Zhuo turned off the computer and went to bed to rest.

“In the blink of an eye, the next day arrived. ”

“In order to welcome the scientific and technological personnel from all over the world,. ”

The main roads of the capital city were all blocked.

The sound of helicopters kept ringing in the sky.

The sirens of police cars also rose and fell.

“In order to participate in today’s science and Technology Conference,. ”

Mu Yourong began to get up at five o’clock in the morning to put on makeup.

“Foundation, Lipstick, Eye Shadow, false eyelashes were all necessary. ”

Her hair was coiled into a princess’s head.

“In order to show off her impressive figure, Mu Yourong specially chose a long and tight dress. ”

It was red!

“Today, she would definitely be the most dazzling existence. ”

“After changing into high heels, Mu Yourong leisurely walked out the door. ”

“Outside the hotel, there was already a private car waiting. ”

“As Mu Yourong walked, she paid attention to whether there was anyone following behind her. ”

But there was no one.

Could it be that Niu Hulu YC had already set off ahead of Schedule?

What a pity!

“They were clearly staying in the same hotel, but the two of them did not meet by chance. ”

Mu Yourong lifted the hem of her dress and elegantly got into the car.

She was escorted by police cars along the way and soon arrived at the venue of the science and Technology Conference.

The Science and Technology Conference gathered the bigwigs of various countries.

“As soon as Mu Yourong entered, she received the gazes of many people. ”

She was probably the first participant in history to be so young.

It was normal for these people to be surprised.

“Under the gazes of the crowd, Mu Yourong followed the etiquette lady step by step to her seat. ”

There were nameplates placed on the table in front of her seat.

The person sitting to her left was precisely Niu Hulu YC!

Mu Yourong’s heart couldn’t help but beat wildly.

“Without even thinking about it, it was obvious that this seat had definitely been arranged by Niu Hulu YC in advance. ”

“Otherwise, how could it be so coincidental that the person sitting next to him was Niu Hulu YC. ”

It was also unknown whether Cen Shaoqing would be jealous if he saw himself sitting next to Niu Hulu YC when the science and Technology Conference began.

Mu Yourong curled her lips and sat down on her seat.

“At this moment, Niu Hulu YC’s seat was still empty. ”

He had not arrived yet.

“Sensing that many gazes were sizing her up, Mu Yourong straightened her back and maintained her noble bearing. ”

Today’s science and Technology Conference had a live broadcast in the world of Science and technology.

“However, because it was only broadcasted live on the International Science and technology website, ordinary people could not see it at all. ”

Many people watched the live broadcast while posting bullet comments on the forums:

“Zhuang Zhouhua Die: [ F * ck, that’s Yr! He’s so beautiful! ] ”

I really miss you 0636: [ he’s really good! He looks quite young too! ]

Niu Hulu · Xiao Dai: [ why isn’t our father here yet! ]

Niu Hulu · was happy every day: [ looking forward to Father! ]

“Niu Hu Lu: [ I’m going to complete a mission first. When father arrives, I’ll have to trouble you all to kick me. ] ”

“Are you retarded? 0165: [ I didn’t expect XR to be so young! At first, I thought she was already in her thirties! ] ”

Life and death! [ the person in charge is interesting! He actually arranged YC and YR’s seats together! ]

“Hua ran X R: [ the conference is about to begin. I feel that YC will not come again! A team dog, how would he dare to come to such a place? ] ”

Hua Meng Ren Ea: [ one more upstairs! ]

“Niu Hu Lu, Qiang Guo, and Yu Di: [ father will definitely come! ] ”

“Niu Hu Lu, Lou Lao Ba 00: [ that Hua ran is misleading the masses again. ] ”

At the venue of the Science and Technology Conference.

Mu Yourong enjoyed the feeling of being looked up at by others.

At this moment.

A gasp of cold air suddenly came from within the venue.

Following that.

Everyone’s gazes shifted away from her and looked towards the entrance.

Mu Yourong frowned slightly.

Why was everyone looking towards the entrance?

Who entered?

“Although the people in the science and technology world had great abilities, they were all crooked and ugly. ”

They were especially ugly.

She had dressed up meticulously.

Could it be that she was not as attractive as a crooked and ugly person?

She really had no taste!

Mu Yourong snorted coldly in her heart.

But she did not turn her head along with everyone else.

She wanted to be the most special one!

She was not the kind of person who would drift along with the flow and be superficial.

The footsteps were getting closer and closer.

It was as if she was about to walk to her side.

Mu Yourong narrowed her eyes.

Could it be that Nehulu YC had come?
