“Doctor Liu was still a little worried. “Um, Miss Ye, is Weiwei really alright?” ”

“Although Weiwei’s condition had not improved over the past few days, she had not fainted either. ”

“”She’s fine. Don’t worry,”ye Zao said. ”

“That’s good.”

The two of them walked out as they spoke.

“When they reached the door, ye Zao continued, “Doctor Liu, let’s stop here.” ”

“”Take care, Miss Ye.”Doctor Liu stopped. ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “If there’s any special situation tonight, just give me a call.” ”

“Okay.”Doctor Liu nodded.

Ye Zhuo walked forward.

Cen Shaoqing had not arrived yet.

She was ready to walk around the area.

Beep!

“At this moment, the sound of a horn honking suddenly sounded in the air. ”

Ye Zao turned around and saw an ordinary Volkswagen.

The door was open.

“Under the dim light, one could vaguely see the handsome side profile of the man. ”

It felt a little cold.

Ye Zao went to the passenger seat and opened the door. “Why did you change cars today? I almost didn’t recognize you!”

“CEN Shaoqing said slowly, “I didn’t want to be recognized. I didn’t expect that I didn’t even recognize my own girlfriend.” ”

Ye Zao chuckled. “Who knew that you would suddenly change cars?”

“Cen Shaoqing started the engine. As he drove, he turned to look at her. “Shall we have supper first?” ”

“”Okay.”Ye Zao suddenly thought of the spicy hotpot that Wei Wei had just eaten and continued, “Let’s go to Linhuang Road.” ”

Ye Zao immediately saw through ye Zao’s thoughts. “Let’s Have Spicy Hotpot?”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Smart!”

“”Okay.”CEN Shaoqing continued, “By the way, why did you run to the hospital so late?” ”

“”I forgot to tell you that my sister-in-law is pregnant,”ye Zao said. ”

“So Soon?”Cen Shaoqing was a little surprised.

“”Not really.”Ye Zao smiled and said, “My brother and sister-in-law have always wanted to have a child, but for some reason, they never got pregnant. My Sister-in-law even suspects that there’s something wrong with her.” ”

“CEN Shaoqing said, “They haven’t been married for long, right?” ”

“”It’s been more than a year,”ye Zao answered. ”

“It’s been more than a year.”Cen Shaoqing could not help but sigh. “Time really flies!”

Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Yes.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Soon, they arrived at Linhuang Road. ”

“Linhuang Road was an old street, and the business on both sides of the street was very good. ”

This was especially true for this hot pot restaurant.

“Even before they got out of the car, ye Zao could already smell a familiar fragrance. ”

“Because the smell was not bad, and because the boss insisted on not raising the price for twenty years, business was very brisk. ”

“It was already close to midnight, and there was still a queue. ”

“Ye Zao opened the door of the passenger seat. “I’ll go line up first, you park the car.” ”

It was still quite difficult to find a parking spot in this area.

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Okay.”

Ye Zhuo unfastened his seatbelt as if he suddenly thought of something. “Do you have cash?”

“The owners of this shop were all elderly people who did not know how to use smartphones, so they only accepted cash. ”

“”I have it in my wallet,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“Ye Zhuo picked up his wallet from the console and took out a hundred yuan note. Then, he closed the door and went to queue up. ”

There were about ten people in front of him.

Ye Zao was not in a hurry. He stood in line and looked at his phone.

The capital at night was very different from the day.

The cool breeze blew away the heat in his heart. It was very comfortable.

Cen Shaoqing parked the car and ran to look for ye Zao.

“When he came to ye Zao’s side, he was just in line to pick the dishes. ”

“What do you want to eat?”Ye Zao looked back slightly.

“I’m fine with anything.”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Then I’ll just take whatever I want.” ”

“Okay.”

“The dishes in the ordinary spicy hot pot restaurant were all weighed, but the dishes here were different. The vegetarian dishes cost 50 cents per skewer, and the meat dishes cost 1.50 yuan per skewer. ”

“Ye Zao took the portion for two or three people, and it was only 30 yuan. ”

“Add two bowls of rice.”

“The owner looked at ye Zao and then said, “Little girl, a porridge and a rice are hard to come by. Can the two of you eat so much?” ”

Very few people would order rice when they were eating spicy hot soup.

“”Don’t worry, we can finish it,”ye Zhuo said with a smile. ”

The shop owner nodded. “That’s good. Our shop refuses to waste food.”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“After paying, they waited for the meal. ”

Ye Zhuo turned to look at Cen Shaoqing. “Shall we sit outside?”?

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddha beads and nodded slightly.

There was only one empty seat outside.

Cen Shaoqing picked up a tissue and carefully wiped the table and chair. Only then did he look up at Ye Zhuo. “Sit.”
