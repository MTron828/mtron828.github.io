“Now, it was the Cen family’s request for marriage. ”

“As long as there were no problems with the Lin family, the Cen family only needed to cooperate well. ”

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “I also think that February 6th is a pretty good day.” ”

“”Since both of you think it’s pretty good, then let’s set it for February 6th,”Lin Jincheng continued. ”

“”What about the two young people?”Lin Qingxuan smiled and looked at Ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing. “Zhuozhuo, Shaoqing, what do the two of you think? is February 6th okay?” ”

“Ye Langhua continued, “Yes, yes, yes. His fourth uncle is right. The important thing is that both young men like this day. We should ask the two young men.” ”

“I’m fine with it.”Ye Zhuo turned to Cen Shaoqing. “What About You?”

Cen Shaoqing twirled the prayer beads. “I’m fine with it too.”

“Of course, Cen Shaoqing hoped that the wedding date would be as close as possible. ”

“In the past, he loved being a monk. ”

He ate vegetarian scriptures every day to clear his mind and keep his desires low.

“However, there were some things that once started, he could no longer clear his mind and keep his desires low. ”

“Old Madam Cen smiled and said, “Since there’s no problem, then let’s set it up like this. Father and mother, let’s set the wedding date for the two children on the sixth day of February.” ”

“Sure.”Lin Jincheng nodded.

“After the wedding date was set, Old Mrs. Cen felt relieved, she smiled and said, “Our Shaoqing is lucky to be together with Zha Zha Zha. Father Zha Zha, Mother Zha Zha, Lang Hua, and a few uncles, please rest assured that after Zha Zha arrives at our Cen family, we will not let her suffer any grievances.” ”

“Hearing this, Zhou Xiang continued, “Last night, my mother said that when Zhonghua marries into the family, she will let Zhonghua be the head of the family.” ”

“Yes.”Old Mrs. Cen nodded.

The elders at the table were all satisfied.

It had to be said that the CEN family did a good job.

“Cen Shaoqing held ye Zhonghua’s hand tightly and said in a low voice, “Leader, you will not be my leader alone from now on.” ”

“Huh?”Ye Zao looked at him in puzzlement.

“Cen Shaoqing’s voice was low and deep as he whispered into her ear, “You are the leader of our entire family. You are a leader who will never go back on his word.” ”

“Hearing this, Ye Zao’s brows and eyes were filled with smiles. ”

“After the wedding date was discussed, the elders were divided into several groups: those who fought the landlord, those who played mahjong, and those who fought the landlord. ”

The Lin family manor was very lively.

“Ye Langhua looked at the lively scene and said with some emotion, “It’s a pity that grandma searing can’t see.” ”

“Hearing this, Old Mrs. Cen’s eyes also looked distant. “In the blink of an eye, time really flies.”She still clearly remembered the scene when she went to university with old Mrs. Lin. ”

“At that time, both of them were still young girls in their twenties. ”

“In the blink of an eye, their old friends had turned into a pile of dirt. ”

“Ye langhua nodded and continued, “Life is like a dream!” ”

“Thinking back to the past, ye Langhua’s heart was filled with a myriad of emotions. ”

Old Madam Cen looked at Ye Langhua. “Langhua.”

“Yes.”

“Old madam CEN continued, “Do you still have any unfulfilled wishes in your life?” ”

Ye Langhua smiled and shook her head. “No.”

“In the past, her greatest dream was to be reunited with her daughter. ”

“Unfortunately, she had experienced disappointment after disappointment. ”

“Now that she had finally found her daughter and shared the joy of family, ye Langhua really did not have any other wishes. ”

“”What About You, elder sister?”Ye Langhua looked at Old Mrs. Cen. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “Yes.” ”

“What is it?”Ye Langhua asked.

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “I want to witness the birth of my great-grandchild with my own eyes.” ”

“After saying that.., old Mrs. Cen continued, “I’ve done some calculations. Zhuozhu and Shaoqing will get married in February next year. If they get married and get pregnant for the second time, the child will be born in February the next year. If things continue to develop at this pace, I’ll have to persist for another three years. “My current physical condition is pretty good. I probably won’t leave just like that. “I’ll pay more attention in the future. I must see my precious great-grandchild.” ” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Because CEN Shaoqing had always been in a state of no love and no marriage, wanting to see the birth of Cen Shaoqing and Ye Zhuo’s child with her own eyes had almost become an obsession of old Madam Cen. ”

“Ye Langhua turned to look at Old Madam Cen. “With your good health, not only can you see the birth of the child, but you can also see him go to school, get married, and have children.” ”

“Hearing this, Old Madam Cen laughed out loud. “I’m already ninety-eight this year. If I live long enough for him to get married and have children, won’t I become an old monster?” ”

“Ye Langhua said, “What old monster! There are many centenarians now!” ”
