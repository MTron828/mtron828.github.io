Yala turned to look at his assistant. “Slow it down by ten times.”

“Okay.”The assistant nodded.

“However, when the HD camera and the speed were slowed down by ten times, they still couldn’t capture how she made her move.”

“Five times slower!”

“Ten times slower!”

“Ten times slower!”

“The assistant turned to look at Yaler. “Minister, this is already the slowest speed. We can’t be any slower.””

Yaler’s expression was a little ugly.

“Hibbert’s hand speed was considered fast in the circle. When the camera was slowed down by ten times, they could vaguely see some clues.”

“However, they could not see any flaws in this little Chinese girl.”

“What’s her name?”Yaler asked.

“Hibbert said, “An.””

“”An?”Yaler continued, “What’s her Chinese name?””

“”That’s not very clear,”Hibbert answered.”

“Yaler raised his hand. “Alright, you can go back first.””

“After saying that, he turned to look at his assistant. “Go and bring this miss An up here.””

“Okay.”

The assistant searched the entire casino but could not find ye Zhuo.

“When ya lei heard that ye Zhuo had disappeared, his face immediately darkened. “Go and check the surveillance cameras!””

“We’ve checked the surveillance cameras but could not find him.”

“Ya Lei narrowed his eyes. “Go and issue a bounty! Even if we have to turn C nation upside down, we have to find him!””

“Yes.”

“Ten minutes later, ye Zao saw his name on the bounty.”

An.

Chinese.

“An hour ago, he appeared at Ranito Casino.”

“Bounty: 1,089,7896.”

“”10,000,000,000,000.”Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly. “Why is it only 10,000,000?””

She was only worth this little money?

What a joke!

Ye Zhuo clicked on it and the editor added the bounty.

“A minute later, ye Zhuo looked at the 11-figure bounty and rubbed his chin in satisfaction.”

“Ye Zhuo had just added the bounty when ya lei received the news. “It seems that An has quite a number of enemies! Someone actually added 10,000,000,000 to take her life.””

On the other side.

Professor Yue and Tang Xue returned from the exhibition site. It was already evening.

“Tang Xue said, “I don’t know if Miss Ye is back yet.””

Professor Yue looked up at Tang Xue. “Did Miss Ye call you this afternoon?”

“Tang Xue took out her phone, and her face instantly turned pale. “T-professor Yue, my phone died and turned off automatically...””

“Professor Yue frowned slightly, and an ominous premonition suddenly arose in his heart.”

“Tang Xue immediately said, “Let’s quickly go to Miss Ye’s room to take a look! If she’s not in her room, then quickly call the police!””

Professor Yue followed Tang Xue to the door of Ye Zao’s room.

“They knocked for a long time, but no one opened the door.”

It seemed that ye Zao had not returned yet.

“She was a single girl, wandering in the streets of a foreign country. There was an 80% chance that something had happened to her.”

Tang Xue’s eyes were filled with excitement.

Creak —

“At this moment, the door suddenly opened.”

“Ye Zhuo, who was wearing pajamas, appeared at the door. “Professor Yue, Miss Tang, what’s the matter?””

“Upon seeing ye Zhuo, professor Yue heaved a sigh of relief. “Miss Ye, when did you come back?””

“”I just came back not long ago,”ye Zhuo said plainly.”

“Professor Yue continued, “Did anything happen?””

“No.”

“”It’s good that you’re fine.”Professor Yue was relieved. “Then, Miss Ye, you should rest well.””

“Okay.”

“After confirming that ye Zao was fine, professor Yue turned around and left.”

“Tang Xue stood where she was, a little confused.”

She had thought that something would definitely happen to Ye Zao.

“In order to make ye Zao not respond to her every day, she had specifically turned off her phone...”

She did not expect ye Zhuo to appear in front of her unscathed.

“Professor Yue took a few steps forward, but seeing that Tang Xue did not follow, he turned around and said, “Little Xue, what are you daydreaming about? Let’s Go!””

Only then did Tang Xue react and follow Professor Yue’s footsteps. “I’m here.”

The next day.

It was the day of the science and Technology Exhibition.

“Early in the morning, Ye Zhuo, professor Yue, Tang Xue, and the others arrived at the exhibition hall.”

It was different from yesterday.

“Today, all the big shots gathered in the exhibition hall.”

“Yesterday, the god of Gamblers, An, became famous after a battle. He had completely become a legend of ranito. At this time, many people were still talking about what happened at Ranito Casino.”

“”Have you heard? The God of Gamblers, An, came from China and actually won against Hibbert!””

“”Yesterday, a friend of mine was at the scene. It is said that An won this number!”Speaking up to this point, the man stretched out five fingers.”

“The bounty on An’s head has already exceeded Hacker Z.”

“Ye Zao’s expression was still as calm as ever, as if he had not heard these words at all.”

“Professor Yue looked at Ye Zao. “Miss Ye, in a while, snowy and I will go talk about the collaboration. You are not familiar with them, so wait for us here.””

Ye Zao was just here to make up the numbers. Professor Yue did not intend to bring ye Zao to talk about the collaboration.

The people at the science and technology exhibition today were all big shots from different countries.

Ye Zao’s status was far from enough.

“As soon as professor Yue finished speaking, Tang Xue said, “Professor Yue, Aaron and Dr. Alva are here!””

Professor Yue looked up. Aaron and Dr. Alva weren’t the only ones here.

Even the director of the exhibition hall was here.

“Professor Yue straightened his back and was about to greet him when the director walked past her to Ye Zao and said respectfully, “Dr. YC! Why didn’t you inform US beforehand that you were coming!””

“Dr. YC!”

Dr. YC?

Ye Zhuo was actually Dr. YC.

Professor Yue’s expression was indescribable.

Tang Xue looked as if she had seen a ghost.

It was not until ye Zhuo was escorted into the VIP room of the exhibition hall that the two of them reacted. They looked at each other and saw disbelief in each other’s eyes.

Professor Yue looked at Tang Xue. “What did the director and Dr. Alva Call Miss Ye Just Now?”

“Tang Xue’s face was pale. “Well, it seems to be Dr. YC...””
