“[ ah ze, I believe that after your mother finds out about this, she will definitely be very happy! Back then, she must have had her own reasons for abandoning you. No matter what, Don’t give up on looking for your mother. I believe that one day, the two of you will meet again. ] ”

“[ oh right, my eldest niece’s results are out! She got the top scorer in science in our Yunjing City! ] ”

“Lin Ze replied very quickly, [ congratulations, Uncle Ye! We can meet in Beijing then. ] ”

[ see you in Beijing! ]

[ red packet ] Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Seeing the red packet sent by Ye Sen, Lin Ze was stunned. ”

“Ye Sen sent him a message, [ a small red packet. To celebrate you getting the top scorer in arts, my niece got the top scorer in science. ] ”

Lin Ze clicked on the red packet and accepted it.

66.6.

It was a very meaningful number.

“[ thank you, Uncle Ye. Next time you come to Beijing, I will treat you to a meal. ] ”

[ Okay. ]

Ye Sen then reported the good news to Bai Wei.

...

Ye Zao came to the restaurant to help.

“As soon as he stepped into the restaurant, he received a congratulatory message from the restaurant staff. “Zao Zao, Congratulations!” ”

“”Zao Zao, you are really amazing! You actually got the top scorer in science in our city! What is wrong with your brain?” ”

Ye Zhuo looked at the crowd in confusion. What were they saying?

Why did she not understand?

Top Scorer?

She got the top scorer in the science department?

Wasn’t her score not out yet?

“When the diners who were eating heard this, they raised their heads curiously. “So this is our Yun Jing’s little top scorer!” ”

They wouldn’t know if they didn’t look.

“When they saw it, they were shocked. ”

This little top scorer was really beautiful.

“One by one, the news spread. Soon, all the customers in the restaurant turned to look at Ye Zao. ”

Their eyes were filled with astonishment.

“”In the past, the best scholar in Our Yun Jing City was from the other counties below. I didn’t expect that this year, there would be a little scholar in this city. You’ve brought glory to our city!” ”

“Calculating, it had been four to five years since there had been a best scholar in Yun Jing City. ”

“This time, he could be considered to have held his head high. ”

“Ye Zhuo was a little confused. After saying thank you, he went upstairs to the rest area and turned on his computer, preparing to check his score. ”

“Just as he turned on his computer, his phone rang. ”

“It was his form teacher, Jiang Wenhui. ”

“Is that student ye Zhuo?”

“”It’s me, teacher Jiang.” ”

“”Student Ye Zhuo, have you checked your score?”Without waiting for Ye Zhuo to answer, jiang Wenhui continued, “You’ve scored 749 points! The top scorer of science in our Yunjing City! A lot of schools have just called me to ask about your first choice! And the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Overseas...” ”

Jiang Wenhui was really too excited.

Very excited.

“After being a teacher for so many years, this was the first time he had encountered such a situation. ”

Many famous schools were vying for his students!

“And he, too, would be named an excellent teacher. ”

A promotion and a raise!

So she had really gotten into the top scorer in science...

“Ye Zhuo’s expression remained the same. “Thank you, teacher Jiang. I Won’t consider foreign universities. I want to go to Beijing University.” ”

“Beijing University? Are you sure?”Jiang Wenhui asked.

“”Yes, I’m very sure.” ”

“Jiang Wenhui nodded. “Alright, I understand! Student Ye Zhuo, Congratulations! Thank you too!” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Teacher Jiang, I should be the one thanking you.” ”

“After hanging up the phone, ye Shu walked up from downstairs. ”

“Ye Shu hugged ye Zao excitedly. “Zao Zao, you’re really awesome!” ”

The top scorer in science!

“Before this, Ye Shu didn’t even dare to think about it. ”

“”Of course!”Ye Zao said proudly, “If your daughter isn’t awesome, then who is?” ”

“At this moment, Bai Nana ran up while panting. “Lady Boss, a television station is looking for me downstairs. They want to interview Zao Zao!” ”

Television station? !

“Ye Shu said in surprise, “Really?” ”

“Yes!”Bai nana nodded.

“Ye Shu hurriedly said, “Then let’s hurry down.” ”

Ye Zao originally didn’t have much interest in interviews.

“But seeing that ye Shu was so excited, he didn’t refuse and followed her downstairs. ”

They only found out after they went downstairs.

It wasn’t just the reporters.

The district head and the person-in-charge of the community had all come.

There hadn’t been a top scorer in Yunjing City for many years.

They had suddenly become the top scorer in science.

Everyone was too excited. They shook hands with ye Zao one by one and gave him the prize money.

The camera at the side recorded the entire process.

“It wasn’t Ye Zao’s first time on camera, so she wasn’t nervous. On the other hand, ye Shu seemed to be a little nervous. Ye Zao held her hand tightly. ”

Ye Shu raised her head and looked at ye Zao.

“From this angle, she could just see the confident smile on ye Zao’s face. ”

“Suddenly, Ye Shu was not nervous anymore. She smiled at the camera and answered the reporters’questions one by one. ”
