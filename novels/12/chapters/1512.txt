And this time.

“”Fourth aunt, we are a family. You are too polite to say this.”Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “You should take good care of your body. I believe that in the near future, you will be able to have a healthy baby!””

“Really?”Xia Xiaoman asked.

Ye Zao nodded.

“Xia Xiaoman continued, “I have been taking birth control pills for such a long time. Won’t it affect anything?””

“Ye Zao said, “As long as you take good care of yourself, it basically won’t affect anything.””

“Hearing ye Zao’s words, Xia Xiaoman was relieved. “Zao Zao, Thank You!””

“Zhang Zhenzhen stood at the side and said with a smile, “Fourth sister-in-law, this is a blessing in disguise! In my opinion, this little twelve is really our family’s Lucky Star!””

“That’s right!”Yang Wenyin and Wu Mei agreed very much.

“It was not known whether it was a coincidence or not, but ever since ye Zao returned to the Lin family, the company of the Lin brothers had become a lot more popular!”

“Not only was ye Zao Beautiful, but he was also so outstanding. No matter where they went, they felt honored to have a niece like ye Zao.”

“Zhang Zhenzhen continued, “Since things have been settled, let’s get ready to eat! I’m starving to death!”Zhang Zhenzhen touched her belly.”

“Xia Xiaoman said, “Why don’t you guys eat first! Seriously! Then let’s Open Up!””

“”You guys aren’t back yet, and the matter hasn’t been settled. How can we have the mood to eat!””

“Xia Xiaoman instructed the butler to arrange for the meal. Although there was a small incident, the atmosphere in the Lin family villa was still very good.”

“The Lin family were eating in the restaurant, and the servants were all discussing it.”

Who would have thought that Auntie Sun would do such a thing?

“You can’t judge a book by its cover!”

“”No Wonder I saw that little sun kept leaning into Sir’s bedroom. At first, I didn’t know why! It turned out that she had ulterior motives!””

“”Actually, I already knew that something was wrong with Auntie Sun!”! She looked honest and smiling at everyone, but behind her back, she had another face! “Just the last time, I saw Auntie Sun Kick Vagabond Away with my own eyes! “If she was really that good, how could she treat a small animal like that?””

“Oh my God! Why is this woman so Vicious!”

“Is that Cat Alright?”

“...”

At the police station.

“Sun Jiayi had grown up and had eaten all kinds of food, but she had never eaten any of the food at the police station.”

A mouthful of rice in her mouth was like chewing wax.

She did not confess.

She could not confess.

“As long as she insisted that she did not know anything about this, the police and the law would not be able to do anything to her.”

Right.

She did not confess.

“In the following interrogation, Sun Jiayi refused to confess.”

The police in charge of the interrogation were on the verge of collapse!

Cen Shaoqing went back from ye Zao.

“Ye Zao sat in the passenger seat and was a little sleepy. Suddenly, she seemed to have thought of something and picked up her phone to send a message.”

Cen Shaoqing had one hand on the steering wheel and the other on the prayer beads. He turned to look at Ye Zhuo. “Leader.”

“”Yes,”ye Zhuo replied.”

“My aunt is here. She wants to see you before she goes home.”

“Aunt?”Ye Zhuo turned to look at Cen Shaoqing. “Is she grandma’s sister?”

“Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Yes, she’s Grandma’s cousin! She’s quite kind.””

“Is she at your house now?”Ye Zhuo continued to ask.

“Yes.”

“”Then let’s do it tomorrow! I have nothing to do tomorrow,”ye Zhuo said.”

“”Okay.”CEN Shaoqing continued, “Then I’ll come and pick you up tomorrow morning.””

“”Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and continued, “How many sisters does grandma have?””

“CEN Shaoqing said, “Grandma has a biological brother and a biological sister. “She also has a cousin, who is the great-aunt who came this time. Her great-uncle passed away three years ago, and there’s also a little great-aunt who lives in the countryside. In the early years, she had some conflicts with grandma, and the two of them have not spoken for many years. During the holidays, my mother and I would go to visit her. “However, she’s a loner and can’t talk much with others. Every time, my mother and I would go in the morning and come back in the afternoon.””

“Ye Zao nodded slightly. “I see! Right, I’ll go tomorrow. Do you want me to bring some gifts for Auntie?””

“No need. Your arrival is the biggest gift.”Cen Shaoqing opened his thin lips. “Auntie is very curious about what you look like!”

“In the blink of an eye, the next day arrived.”

“Ye Zao woke up at 6:30 AM on time. After running, he went to eat.”

“Lin Ze was already sitting in the dining room eating. When he saw ye Zao Come In, Lin Ze stood up and said, “Zao, what do you want to eat? Porridge or rice noodles? I’ll get it for you.””

The rice noodles were brought over by a relative in his hometown. They were paired with the chef’s secret toppings and tasted especially good.

“Ye Zao sat down. “Only children make choices! I want a bowl of porridge and a bowl of rice noodles. Thank you, Brother.””

Lin Ze was stunned. “There’s so much. Can you finish it?”

“”Don’t worry, I can finish it!”Ye Zao picked up the eggs on the table and crushed them. Then, he started peeling the shells.”

“Lin Ze carried out the porridge and rice noodles. When he saw ye Zao peeling the eggs again, he was a little surprised.”

“Although he knew that his sister had a bigger appetite than ordinary girls, he did not expect that ye Zao could eat so much!”

“After peeling the eggs, ye zhuo separated the egg yolk from the egg white and turned to look at Lin Ze. “Brother, do you eat egg yolks?””

“Lin Ze knew that she did not like egg yolks, so he smiled and said, “Give them to me!””

Ye Zhuo immediately handed the egg yolk to Lin ze.

“It was true that she did not like to eat egg yolks. She always found the taste of the egg yolk unbearable, but she especially liked to eat egg white. If no one really ate the egg yolk, ye zhuo would grit his teeth and eat it.”

“No matter what, she would not waste food!”

“Ye Zao started eating the porridge first. She did not eat slowly, but she was not rude. Instead, it was very pleasing to the eye. Her every move exuded a noble aura.”

“Seeing ye Zao finish a bowl of porridge and a bowl of rice noodles, Lin ze was a little surprised.”

“After all, he was a big boy and could not eat so much.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“After eating, Ye Zao stood up. “Brother, I have something to do. I’m leaving First!””

“Where are you going?”Lin Ze stood up as well.

“Ye Zao said, “Cen Shaoqing’s aunt is here. I’m going to take a look.””

“”OH.”Lin Ze nodded and followed ye Zao’s footsteps. “That Zao Zao, you’ve been with Cen Shaoqing for so long. Has Cen Shaoqing ever lost his temper at you?”As the saying goes, time reveals the heart of a person, because of his childhood experience, Lin Ze had always been worried that Cen Shaoqing had a violent element in his body.”

“Although ye Zao was quite powerful, she was still a little girl. If they really fought, she would definitely suffer!”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Don’t worry, brother. Cen Shaoqing is not the kind of person with no morals!””

“Lin Ze suddenly felt a little melancholic. He was such a good and pretty sister, but he actually wanted to take advantage of Cen Shaoqing.”

“”Zhongrao, if he dares to bully you, just tell me. I’ll help you beat him back!”In order to protect ye Zhongrao, Lin Ze had been studying combat and Sanda recently.”

“”Okay.”Ye Zhongrao nodded slightly. “Brother, I’ll leave first. Call me if there’s anything!””

“It Snowed Last Night. Tell Cen Shaoqing to drive slowly!”Lin Ze instructed.

“Got it.”Ye Zao put on his hat and walked out of the door.

“On the other side, at the CEN residence.”

“After learning that ye Zao had come back today, old Mrs. Cen sat in the living room, looking like she was about to die. Whenever she heard the sound of a car, she would stand up to see if it was ye Zao.”

“Bai Shu was also a little anxious, but she was more curious. Old Mrs. Cen had described ye Zao as too unlike a normal human being!”
