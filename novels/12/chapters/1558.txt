“Hearing this, old Mrs. Lin continued, “Were you both drunk at that time?” ”

“Yes.”Lin Ze nodded.

“Then do you have any other impressions?”

“”No.”Lin Ze continued, “When I saw Zhang Qingqing again, she was already pregnant.” ”

“”Scheming against you! She must be scheming against you! Ah Ze, let me tell you, you can’t have such a Woman!”Old Mrs. Lin continued, “Perhaps the child in her belly isn’t yours at all! No wonder searing suspects her!” ”

Lin Ze didn’t know what to say either. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“When he woke up the next morning, there was indeed blood on the bed. ”

“Even though he wasn’t a person, he knew what those blood stains meant. ”

“Old Mrs. Lin said, “Isn’t there that type of amniocentesis now? It can be done for DNA! Let that woman do the DNA test! Our Ah Ze is such an honest child. Even if he was drunk, he wouldn’t do such a thing!” ”

Old Mrs. Lin had raised Lin ze single-handedly. No one knew Lin ze better than her.

“Ye Shu said, “Zhang Qingqing is still four weeks pregnant. She can’t do a saline amniocentesis. The amniocentesis will take 14 to 21 weeks! Moreover, amniocentesis is not good for the fetus.”If she could do an amniocentesis.., ye Shu wouldn’t have waited until now. ”

“”Then we’ll wait for burning to come back and ask clearly.”Old Mrs. Lin continued, “Let’s ignore that woman for the time being! Who knows what she’s thinking! We can’t let our guard down!” ”

Old Mrs. Cen did not want to see Lin Ze being lied to.

“Ye Langhua continued, “This method isn’t absolute. What if that child really belongs to Ah Ze?” ”

Who could say for sure about this kind of thing!

“Old Mrs. Lin narrowed her eyes. “How about this, let’s keep her cold for now! We’ll wait for Luoluo’s reply. If Luoluo says there’s no problem, then we’ll go look for her!”In any case, old Mrs. Lin absolutely believed in ye Zao, ye Zao and Lin Ze were biological siblings. Ye Zao would definitely not let Lin Ze be harmed by outsiders! ”

“That’s fine too.”Ye Shu nodded.

“Ye Langhua said, “This is the only way now!” ”

“Ye Shu looked at Lin Ze and continued, “AH ze, don’t put too much pressure on her. Things will work out when the time comes.” ”

“”Okay.”Lin Ze nodded slightly. “Mom, if there’s nothing else, I’ll go back to my room first.” ”

“Go ahead.”

“Looking at Lin Ze’s back, old Mrs. Lin Sighed. “Ah Ze has changed a lot! What a pity!”She was not even married yet. If she were to get married, it would be terrible! Old Mrs. Lin disliked Zhang Qingqing even more. She felt that Zhang Qingqing was up to no good. Look at what she had done to Lin Ze! ”

“If she really married such a girl, it would cause chaos in the family! ”

“After saying that, old Mrs. Lin continued, “I think that girl Lizi is quite smart. How could she know such a friend!” ”

“Old Mrs. Lin originally thought that an Lizi’s friend wouldn’t be too bad, but she didn’t expect that she still misjudged. ”

“Ye Shu looked at Old Mrs. Li and continued, “Maybe Lizi was also deceived! Mom, searing isn’t back yet, so we can’t make a conclusion easily. What if things aren’t what you think!” ”

“I think it’s more or less the case!”Old Madam Lin said.

On the other side.

At the hotel.

Zhang Qingqing’s cell phone rang. She picked it up and saw that it was her mother calling.

“Mom.”Zhang Qingqing picked up the phone.

“Mother Zhang’s voice came from the other end. “Qingqing, have you eaten?” ”

“I have. What About You?”

“Mother Zhang said, “Your father and I are preparing to eat.” ”

“The mother and daughter chatted for a while before mother Zhang sighed and said, “Qingqing, your brother’s marriage might be ruined.” ”

“Why?”Zhang Qingqing was very surprised.

“Her brother, Zhang Lei, and his girlfriend, Qiao Yue, had been talking for three years and were preparing to take care of some matters this year. Why would there be a problem at such a critical moment? ! ”

“Mother Zhang continued, “Qiao Yue’s family wants us to buy a villa on Linbo Road, and they want us to pay in full. Our family’s business has been declining year by year. We only have enough money to buy a three-bedroom villa, how can we afford a villa!”The Zhang family could be considered a wealthy family in the local area, the couple ran the tea business and had three to four million in cash, but a villa cost ten million, how could they afford it! ”

“”So it’s about this! I thought it was a big deal! Mom, don’t be anxious, you go and tell Qiao Yue that we’ll buy this villa!”Not to mention a villa.., right now, even if she bought ten villas, it wouldn’t be a problem. A villa cost ten million, and ten villas would only cost one hundred million. ”
