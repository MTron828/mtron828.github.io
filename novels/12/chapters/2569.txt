Translator: 549690339

“”Yes.”Fifth Master Cen, who had always been able to summon the wind and rain in the business world, lost his composure in front of his father-in-law for the first time. “It’s time to go back. Goodbye, Uncle.” ”

“After taking a few steps, Cen Shaoqing seemed to have thought of something and turned his head. “Zhuozhuo, I’ll go back first.” ”

“Ye Zhuo could not help but laugh. She had never realized that Cen Shaoqing was so afraid of Lin Jincheng. “En, you go back first.” ”

Cen Shaoqing turned around and left.

“Looking at Cen Shaoqing’s back as he left, Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Dad, why are you scaring him?” ”

“Lin Jincheng said, “I’m not scaring him. It’s because he’s timid to begin with.” ”

“”It’s all because you’ve always had a straight face.”Ye Zhuo continued, “You should learn from my mother.” ”

“”You should learn from your mother!”Lin Jincheng said a little angrily, “My precious daughter is going to be raped by him! Do I have to set off two sets of firecrackers to celebrate?” ”

Perhaps only after becoming a father could one understand the feelings of marrying a daughter. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

It was very uncomfortable.

“No matter how outstanding the future son-in-law was.., ”

ye Zhuo laughed out loud.

“Even when he returned to the bedroom, Lin Jincheng was still a little depressed. ”

Ye Shu was about to go out.

“Lin Jincheng grabbed her arm and asked, “Where are you going?” ”

“Ye Shu said, “I’m going to see Shaoqing.” ”

“”He went back,”Lin Jincheng said. ”

“”This child, why didn’t he say hello when he left!”Ye Shu said. ”

Cen Shaoqing had always been a polite person. He had never left without saying goodbye.

“Lin Jincheng continued, “He was scared back by me.” ”

“What happened?”Ye Shu immediately asked.

Lin Jincheng briefly explained the reason.

“Hearing that.., ye Shu said, “Ren Shaoqing is not afraid of you at all. He respects you. After all, you’re burning’s father. I’m warning you, you’re not allowed to keep a straight face in front of Shaoqing in the future! Why are you making things difficult for his child? !” ”

“In any case, ye Shu just wanted to see how satisfied CEN Shaoqing was. ”

“Our family’s precious daughter is about to be taken away. Can’t we just let him have his way?”Lin Jincheng said.

Who could understand the heartache of an old father!

“Ye Shu held Lin Jincheng’s hand and said earnestly, “When children grow up, they will eventually have a family. According to what you said, do you still want to keep Yaozhuo as an old lady?” ”

“Lin Jincheng understood the logic, but he still felt a little uncomfortable. His eyes were red as he said, “It was not easy for our Lin family to have a girl like Yaozhuo, but in the end, she is going to get married so early.” ”

“”Aiya, Alright, Alright.”Ye Shu hugged Lin Jincheng. “This Zha Zha Zha hasn’t gotten married yet, and you’re already like this. Then on the day of Zha Zha Zha’s wedding, how will you cry?” ”

“As she spoke, Ye Shu’s eyes were also slightly red, she continued, “Actually, I can’t bear to part with Zha Zha, but a daughter is old, she has to get married eventually! She has to have her own family... ... We should be happy and not burden our two children. Besides, this is a happy occasion. It’s not nice to see you keep a straight face!” ”

“As he finished speaking, ye Shu wiped his tears and continued, “Oh right, fourth sister-in-law just called and asked us to visit her house tomorrow.” ”

“What’s the situation?”Lin Jincheng asked.

“”Lizi brought her boyfriend back,”ye Shu said. ”

Lin Jincheng instantly found comfort in his heart. “Lizi also has a boyfriend?”

“Originally, it was just his family’s cabbages being stolen by a pig! ”

“Now that Lin Qingxuan’s family’s cabbages were also being stolen, his mood instantly improved a lot. ”

“Yeah.”Ye Shu nodded. “And you even know the boy.”

“Who is it?”Lin Jincheng asked curiously.

Ye Shu remained mysterious. “Take a guess.”

“Lin Jincheng said, “The son of the old Zhang Family?” ”

“That’s not right.”Ye Shu shook her head.

“”Could he be from the old Xu Family?”Lin Jincheng continued, “Old Xu had previously asked me to Matchmake Lizi. What do you think about an uncle like me matchmaking his niece? “Then, I asked him to find someone else. I didn’t expect it to really work out. Speaking of which, that kid from the old Xu family is really not bad, but he’s still a little inferior compared to Shaoqing.” ”

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “Why? Are you thinking about Shaoqing Now?” ”

“”I guess so,”Lin Jincheng said. ”

“After saying that, Lin Jincheng continued, “Is Lizi’s boyfriend really old Xu’s son?” ”

“No.”Ye Shu shook her head. “Guess again?”

“Guess again?”Lin Jincheng frowned slightly. “Then who else could it be?”

He really couldn’t think of anyone else.

“”Oh, you just tell me directly!”Lin Jincheng said. ”
