Could it be that the Lin family went back on their word at the last minute?

“Old Madam Feng presided over the overall situation as she whispered to the butler beside her, “Quickly get someone to go to the Lin family’s side to see what’s going on.” ”

“”Yes, Old Madam, I’ll go right away.”The Butler immediately walked out. ”

Upstairs in the bedroom.

Feng Qianhua was wearing a wine-red gown and an exquisite hair accessory on her head as she looked at herself in the mirror.

“Although she was already thirty-nine years old this year, due to her good maintenance and hyaluronic acid, the years did not leave any traces on her face. Compared to the frivolous youth of nineteen years ago.., it was more like the charm of a mature woman. ”

“From now on, she would be the matriarch of the Lin family, Lin Jincheng’s only wife. ”

“Looking back now, these nineteen years of persistence were nothing at all. ”

“At least, she had waited until Lin Jincheng. ”

And what about that B * Tch ye Shu?

So what if she gave birth to two children for Lin Jincheng?

“In the end, wouldn’t it all be for naught? ”

“After a long while, Feng Qianhua picked up the lipstick on the dressing table and slowly applied it on her lips. ”

“At that moment, the door was pushed open from the outside. ”

Feng Qianhua turned around and saw that it was Feng Xianxian who had entered. Feng Xianxian had an anxious look on her face. It seemed like she had something urgent to attend to.

“”Xianxian, how many times have I told you to pay attention to your manners! From now on, you are the eldest daughter of the Lin family. Every Word and action of yours represents the Lin family. You Can’t be so Rash!” ”

The eldest daughter of the Lin family was different from the eldest cousin daughter of the Feng family. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Although Feng Xianxian’s surname was Feng, in the Feng family, the mother and daughter had always been outsiders. ”

Only the Lin family was the true home of the mother and daughter!

“Moreover, the Feng family was a small family and could not compare to the Lin family at all. ”

“Feng Xianxian could not care less and continued, “Mother, the auspicious time has passed, but Uncle Lin has not come yet. Do you think there will be any changes?” ”

“Hearing this, Feng Qianhua’s expression changed. “What time is it now?” ”

“Feng Qianqian said, “It’s already 12:20!” ”

“The master had calculated the auspicious time to be 12:16. Logically speaking, Lin Jin Cheng should have arrived a few minutes earlier, but it was already four minutes later, and Lin Jin Cheng was still nowhere to be seen. ”

Feng Qianqian’s intuition told her that this wasn’t a good thing.

Feng Qianhua narrowed her eyes slightly. “What time is the second auspicious time?”

“In order to prevent accidents, two auspicious times were usually prepared. ”

“”13:14 pm,”Feng Qianqian answered. ”

The corners of Feng Qianhua’s mouth curled up. “1314 signifies a lifetime. Perhaps your uncle Lin likes this auspicious time more!”

“”Mom, aren’t you worried at all?”Feng Qianqian admired Feng Qianhua very much. The commotion downstairs was about to break out, but Feng Qianhua was so calm. ”

“Feng Qianhua closed the lid of her lipstick and pursed her lips. “Your uncle Lin won’t marry anyone else but me. What’s there to be worried about?”During the days when Lin Jincheng was out discussing cooperation, lin Ze called Lin Jincheng many times. ”

But Lin Jincheng didn’t pick up.

This meant that Lin Jincheng had made up his mind.

“Today was their engagement day. Lin Jincheng cared about her so much, so how could he drop the ball at such a critical time? ”

“So, Feng Qianhua was not anxious at all. ”

Because she knew that Lin Jincheng had already decided on her.

“In Lin Jincheng’s subconscious mind, she was ye Shu. Lin Jincheng would never let her down! ”

“Moreover, Lin Jincheng had always been a gentleman. He could not go back on his words. ”

Feng Qianhua had always believed in Lin Jincheng’s character.

“After saying that, Feng Qianhua continued, “Your Uncle Lin is an open and aboveboard man. Once he has decided on something, he will not go back on his word.” ”

“Hearing Feng Qianhua’s words, Feng Qianqian also heaved a sigh of relief. She smiled and circled around in front of Feng Qianhua. “Mom, what do you think of my outfit today?” ”

“”Good, very good.”Feng Qianhua nodded in satisfaction and then instructed, “Remember not to touch meat dishes and wine at today’s banquet.” ”

“Fifth Cen was not only vegetarian, but he also did not drink wine. ”

“Feng Xianxian was wearing a blue and white cheongsam today. In addition to her outstanding facial features, she looked very elegant and charming in this way. ”

“Although there were beauties in the capital, there were not many natural beauties. ”

Most of the daughters of socialites had gone to the beauty salon to make minor adjustments. Only Feng Xianxian was naturally sculpted.

“Feng Qianhua believed that in today’s banquet hall, Feng Xianxian was the most eye-catching existence. ”

“At that time, not to mention Cen Wuye, even half of the capital’s noble families and dignitaries would have to bow down to Feng Xianxian. ”
