Translator: 549690339

“Zhou Ziyue was in a bad mood, but she couldn’t show it. ”

“Bai Jingshu continued to ask, “What other requirements do you have for a boy?” ”

“Zhou ziyue smiled and said, “I don’t have too many requirements. As long as he has a heart of ambition.” ”

“Hearing that, Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “I can’t guarantee anything else, but Ziyue, don’t worry. Zheng Ke definitely has a heart of ambition.” ”

Ambition?

Who Didn’t have the ambition?

But what was the use of having the ambition alone?

Would ambition allow her to live like Bai Jingshu?

“If she had known earlier that Bai Jingshu was introducing an ordinary person to her, she wouldn’t have agreed to it no matter what. ”

It was simply a waste of time!

“This Bai Jingshu was really funny. She was marrying a rich man, and she was introducing an ordinary person to her. ”

Disgusting!

“But since she was already here, it wouldn’t be good for her to find an excuse to leave at this time. Bai Jingshu could only endure the impatience in her heart and continue walking forward with Bai Jingshu. ”

“Before long, they arrived at the restaurant they had agreed on. ”

“The moment they entered the restaurant, Bai Jingshu saw Zheng Ke. “Jingshu, do you see him? He’s the one by the window. He’s wearing a white shirt and glasses.” ”

Zhou Ziyue looked up.

There was indeed a person sitting by the window.

“He was not bad-looking, and he smelled like a scholar. One look and you could tell that he was a scholar. ”

“But in this era, what could a scholar do? What could a good-looking person do? ”

“Bai Jingshu lowered her voice and said, “What do you think?” ”

“Zhou ziyue said, “We’re too far away, so we can’t see much.” ”

“Then let’s go over first.”Bai Jingshu held Zhou Ziyue’s hand.

The two of them walked into the room.

“Soon, Zheng Ke also noticed the two of them and immediately stood up from his chair. ”

“Teacher Bai.”

“In their author circle, they all called each other “Teacher.”. ”

“Moreover, Bai Jingshu was a very important author in the circle. ”

“”Teacher Zheng, let me introduce you. This is my cousin, Zhou Ziyue.”Bai Jingshu introduced each other. “Ziyue, this is Zheng Ke.” ”

“Zhou ziyue sized up Zheng Ke without batting an eyelid, a look of disdain hidden in her eyes. ”

“The clothes that Zheng Ke was wearing were not branded clothes, nor were they luxury goods. They were just very ordinary taobao goods. It was estimated that they would not even cost 100 yuan. ”

How could such a person deserve to go on a blind date with her!

What was Bai Jingshu thinking?

Zhou Ziyue was furious.

“At that moment, zheng ke said, “Miss Zhou, teacher Bai, what would you like to drink?” ”

“”Orange juice would be fine,”Bai Jingshu said. ”

“Zhou ziyue said, “I’ll just have a glass of plain water.” ”

“It was Bai Jingshu’s first time being a matchmaker, so she didn’t have much experience. Seeing that the two of them didn’t have much to talk about, Bai Jingshu took the initiative and said, “Teacher Zheng, I heard that your hometown is in Yun Jing, right?” ”

“Yes.”Zheng Ke nodded.

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “That’s really a coincidence. Ziyue’s hometown is also in Yun Jing.” ”

“Really?”Zheng Ke was a little surprised.

The capital was very big. It was not easy to meet someone who came from the same place.

Zhou Zi Yue nodded. “Yes.”

“Zheng Ke continued, “I’m from Yun Jing Ke. Where are you from?” ”

“Zhou Zi Yue said, “Zi Wei District.” ”

“Zheng Ke nodded. “Oh, you’re from the city.” ”

“Yeah.”

“Seeing that the topic of conversation was about to end, Bai Jingshu continued, “Oh right, do you two want to add each other on wechat?” ”

“”Sure.”Zheng Ke had a good impression of Zhou Ziyue. Even if they couldn’t become a couple, they were still from the same hometown. ”

The main reason was that Zheng Ke trusted Bai Jingshu.

“Since it was Bai Jingshu who pulled the strings, there was definitely no problem. ”

“Zheng Ke had already taken out his phone. Even if it was for Bai Jingshu’s sake, Zhou Ziyue couldn’t not add him on wechat. “Let me scan you.” ”

“Okay.”Zheng Ke pulled out his QR code.

“Soon, the two of them added each other as friends. ”

“Halfway through, in order to give the two of them more space, Bai Jingshu excused herself and left. ” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“After Bai Jingshu left, Zhou Ziyue was sitting on pins and needles. ”

“Zheng Ke also felt Zhou Ziyue’s discomfort. Considering that this was her first blind date, he was a little nervous, so he suggested, “Why don’t we go watch a movie?” ”

Watch a movie?

Zhou Zi Yue didn’t want to watch a movie with a pauper like Zheng Ke.

“”There’s no need, Mr. Zheng. I still have something to do. I’ll go back first,”Zhou Zi Yue stood up and said. ”

Zheng Ke also stood up. “Then I’ll send you back.”

Zhou Zi Yue didn’t want to have anything to do with this pauper right now. What if he pestered her after sending her back?

“Therefore, if he could keep a distance from this kind of person, he must keep a good distance. He must not give him any room for imagination. ”

“”No need.”Zhou ziyue continued, “I’ll take a taxi back.” ”

“Zheng Ke was a smart man. Seeing Zhou Ziyue like this, he had already guessed what Zhou Ziyue was thinking. ”

“”Okay, be careful on the road.”Zheng Ke wasn’t the kind of person who pestered her. Moreover, it was his first time seeing Zhou Ziyue today, so he couldn’t be considered to be in love. ”

“”Thank you.”After thanking her, Zhou Ziyue turned around and left without looking back. ”

Bad Luck!

She was really unlucky today!

She had wasted so much time for no reason and still did not get anything.

“On the other side, Zheng Ke sent a message to Bai Jingshu. ”

Bai Jingshu immediately called him back. “How did it end so quickly!”

“Zheng ke said, “She said that she had something to do at home.” ”

“Bai Jingshu asked again, “Then why didn’t you send her off?” ”

“Zheng ke explained, “She said that she would take a taxi home herself.” ”

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “Teacher Zheng, you’re too honest. Sometimes, girls will feel embarrassed. After all, this is Ziyue’s first blind date. She said that she didn’t need to send her off, but you really didn’t send her off?” ”

Zheng Ke’s inner and outer conditions were very good. Bai Jingshu personally felt that he and Zhou Ziyue were quite compatible.

“Logically speaking, Zhou Ziyue should not have looked down on Zheng Ke. ”

“Zheng Ke continued, “Teacher Bai, you might have misunderstood the matter. Miss Zhou really doesn’t have feelings for me. If you don’t believe me, you can ask her.” ”

Bai Jingshu was stunned.

“After a while, Bai Jingshu continued, “Then wait a moment. I’ll make a call to ask Ziyue.” ”

“Okay.”

“After hanging up, Bai Jingshu immediately contacted Zhou Ziyue. ”

Zhou Ziyue picked up the call very quickly.

“Bai Jingshu went straight to the point. “Ziyue, you met Zheng Ke today. What do you think?” ”

“Zhou Ziyue hesitated for a moment before continuing, “I’m sorry, Jingshu. Mr. Zheng and I might not be suitable for each other.” ”

“Not suitable?”Bai Jingshu asked.

“”Yes.”Zhou ziyue continued, “I don’t have that kind of feeling towards him either. However, he’s a good person. I believe that he will definitely be able to find an even more outstanding girl.” ”

“Once a good person card was issued, there was an 80-90% chance that this matter would not succeed! ”

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “Alright then. Since the two of you aren’t fated, you can’t force it.” ”

“”Okay.”Zhou ziyue continued, “I’m sorry, Jingshu. I’ve let you go through all this trouble.” ”

“Bai Jingshu said, “It’s fine, it’s fine.” ”

“After hanging up the phone, Bai Jingshu fell into deep thought. ”

“Could it really be like what Lin Ze said? From the start, Zhou Ziyue had been aiming for the second generation of the rich. ”

“Initially, Bai Jingshu did not believe Lin Ze’s words, but now, he was starting to believe them. ”

After all...

Zhou Ziyue’s actions were exactly what Lin Ze had said.

“On the other side, Zhou Ziyue quickly returned to the Lin family. ”

“Seeing Zhou Ziyue, ye Sui asked curiously, “Why did you come back so quickly? Why didn’t you play with others for a while?” ”

“”What do you know!”Zhou ziyue continued, “That Bai Jingshu didn’t have any good intentions! Do you know who she introduced me to?” ”

“Ye Sui quickly asked, “What’s going on? What’s going on? Tell me quickly!” ”

“Zhou ziyue continued, “The person Bai Jingshu introduced me to is also from Yun Jing! She’s not some rich second generation at all! She’s just a pauper, not even comparable to Feng Yang!” ”

“Hearing this, Ye Sui’s heart turned cold. After all, she was still hoping that Zhou Ziyue would find her a rich husband this time! ”

“How could this be? !”Ye Sui was very confused.

“Logically speaking, Bai Jingshu should know people who were either rich or noble. ”

How...

Could things have turned out like this?

“Zhou ziyue continued, “I think Bai Jingshu did it on purpose! Let’s Go! We don’t want to be an eyesore here!” ”

“”Go? Why do we have to go? !”Ye Sui sat on the sofa, “If we leave, won’t we be giving them what they want! They want us to leave now! Anyway, I’m not leaving! Not only am I not leaving, I’m also going to call back and ask your dad and libang to come over!” ”

“Ye Shu didn’t want to buy them a villa, right? ”

Fine!

Then she would disgust ye Shu to death!

Zhou Ziyue turned to look at ye Sui. “Are you really going to do that?”

Ye Sui nodded. “Ye Shu is my sister. She has the obligation to buy us a house!”

It was a matter of course for a sister to help her sister.

“Zhou ziyue continued, “Aren’t you afraid that ye Shu will turn hostile and refuse to acknowledge us?” ”

“”How?”Ye Sui smiled and said, “Your father is her brother-in-law, and libang is her nephew!” ”

They were relatives normally. would ye Shu dare to kick them out?

She thinks ye Shu also dare not!
