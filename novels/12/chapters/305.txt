Cen Shaoqing’s body is simply too good!

“He is also very fond of sports. Three of the treadmills in the house have been broken, and his muscles are especially well developed. ”

Old Mrs. Cen is really worried.

“Hearing this, Zhou Xiang was stunned. She really did not expect old Mrs. Cen to suddenly race. She raised her head and looked at the two people who were talking in front of her, then she said, “Mom, don’t look at how skinny you are. In fact, you are really burning! Burning knows how to fight, how to heal, and how to catch snakes! At that time, it’s still not certain who will win!” ”

Cen Shaoqing and ye Zao were evenly matched.

Neither of them would lose to the other.

“Look at what you are saying. How can my granddaughter-in-law not be amazing?”Old Mrs. Cen said with a proud face.

“Zhou xiang smiled and said, “Then what are you worried about?” ”

Old Mrs. Cen turned to look at Zhou Xiang. “Do you know what age Shaoqing is at now?”

Zhou Xiang was puzzled. “What do you mean?”

“”Thirty years old is of course the age of a wolf and a tiger! “He has been a monk all this time. Do you think searing can withstand the torment when the time comes?”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “To be honest, if Shaoqing isn’t my eldest grandson, I really can’t bear to introduce Yezi to him. I’m simply the best grandmother in the entire universe!” ”

“When she said the last sentence, old Mrs. Cen raised her chin proudly. ”

Zhou Xiang covered his mouth and chuckled.

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Did you bring a camera?” ”

“I did.”Zhou Xiang nodded.

“Give it to me.”

Zhou Xiang took out a camera from his bag and handed it to old Mrs. Cen.

“Old Mrs. Cen took the camera. “Yezi, Shaoqing, I’ll take a photo for you.” ”

Ye Zhuo looked up slightly.

Cen Shaoqing turned his head.

One of them was standing on the yacht while the other was standing on the deck. Behind them was the luxurious yacht and the blue sky and white clouds.

“If it were an ordinary person, they would definitely be suppressed by this luxurious background and would have no sense of existence. ”

“However, these two people were dragons and phoenixes among men. ”

“At this moment, whether it was the sea or the yacht, in front of these two people, they were reduced to a backdrop without any highlights. ”

Kacha —

The beautiful scene was fixed on the camera screen just like that.

Zhou Xiang silently swallowed back the words that Cen Shaoqing never took photos.

It seemed that liking someone was really magical.

“Ever since he met ye Zhuo, Cen Shaoqing had changed a lot invisibly. ” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

It was just that he was still unaware of it.

“At this moment, Old Mrs. Cen handed the camera to Zhou Xiang. “Xiangxiang, come and take a photo for the three of us.” ”

“After saying that, old Mrs. Cen quickly stood between the two of them. ”

“”Three, two, one.” ”

“Then, Zhou Xiang found the yacht’s driver to take a picture of the four of them together. ”

“After taking the picture, the four of them boarded the yacht and started to set off. ”

“After about two hours of sailing, the yacht finally stopped at the northwest side of the island. ”

“”Mom, Zhonghua, Shaoqing! We’re Here!” ”

Zhou Xiang walked in and called for Ye Zhonghua.

“Ye Zhonghua and the Old Lady Cen were sitting in the lobby of the yacht, drinking cold drinks and chatting. ”

“Cen Shaoqing was sitting at the side, holding a Buddhist bead in his hand and occasionally peeling a mangosteen for the two of them. ”

Ye Zhonghua liked eating mangosteen very much.

It was sour and sweet.

“But mangosteen was too cold. It was not good for girls to eat too many cold things. After peeling a mangosteen, Cen Shaoqing picked up an emperor orange. ”

“While chatting with Ye Zhuo, Granny Cen narrowed her eyes at Cen Shaoqing. ”

This rascal was quite attentive.

“Seeing Zhou Xiang walk in from outside, Ye Zhuo raised his eyes in surprise. “You’re here so quickly?” ”

“Zhou xiang smiled and said, “This is fast! It’s already been two hours!” ”

“Two hours, more than 150 kilometers. ”

“I’ve been chatting with Granny Cen. I didn’t expect that two hours had passed unknowingly.”

“Old Mrs. Cen took a sip of her drink, “Yezi, this means that we have a common topic! When we’re together, we have to have a common topic. Don’t be like some wooden people! You Can’t even get a fart out of them! It’s very annoying! No wonder you can’t get a Wife!” ”

Young Master Cen (wooden)(head) Qing (human) :”...”he felt offended.

“”Let’s go, Let’s Go!”Cen stood up and held ye Zhuo and Zhou Xiang’s arms. “Let’s go down and take a look.” ”

“After saying that, she turned to Cen Shao Qing. “Take our luggage.” ”

Cen Shao Qing took the three’s luggage and followed behind.

Cen Old Lady smiled and turned to look at Ye Zhuo. “Men should be porters for us girls!”

The Young Lady:”...”

“As soon as she stepped out of the yacht, she saw the tall and sturdy coconut trees on the beach. ”
