11 am the next day.

Feng Qianhua brought Feng Xianxian to deliver soup to Old Lady Lin.

“She hadn’t seen Feng Xianxian for a long time, and Old Lady Lin missed her quite a bit. Now that she saw Feng Xianxian, Old Lady Lin was very happy. “Xianxian is finally willing to visit Grandma!””

“Feng Xianxian said guiltily, “Grandma, I’m sorry. My classes have been especially full recently. Please Don’t blame me.””

“Seeing Feng Xianxian blaming herself, Old Lady Lin smiled and said, “It’s fine, it’s fine! Silly Child, Grandma is joking with you! Nothing is more important than studying!””

“Are you really not angry?”Feng Xianxian asked.

“I’m really not angry!”

“Aunt Zhang said from the side, “Xianxian, you’re the only granddaughter in Grandmother’s life. She likes you more than anything else! How could she bear to be angry with you?””

“Feng Xianxian said, “You’re wrong. Zhuluo is also grandmother’s granddaughter!”” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“At the mention of Ye Zhuluo, Old Madam Lin’s face immediately fell.”

“That Wild Girl, ye Zhuluo, had never consciously come to see her as a grandmother and had never taken her as a grandmother seriously.”

She could not be compared to Feng Xianxian!

“Old Madam Lin held Feng Xianxian’s hand. “Xianxian, in Grandmother’s heart, you are grandmother’s only granddaughter. Everyone else has to stand aside.””

“Hearing this, a smug look flashed across Feng Xianxian’s eyes. “Grandmother, I heard that my mother found fourth uncle’s fourth aunt. Does this mean that our family is going to have a double wedding?””

Double Wedding?

Old Lady Lin frowned. “Where did the double wedding come from?”

“Feng Xianxian pretended to be very surprised and said, “Grandma, don’t you know? Didn’t searing tell you?””

“Tell me what?”

“Nothing.”Feng Xianxian covered her mouth and a flustered look flashed across her eyes. “Just pretend that I didn’t say anything!”

Feng Qianhua’s expression changed in an instant. “When did you become so talkative!”

“”Mom, I’m sorry...””

“With Feng Qianhua and Feng Qianqian acting this way, Old Madam Lin felt that ye Zao must have done something shameful outside,”

“”Speak!”Old Madam Lin’s face was stern. “Qianqian, speak to me boldly! Don’t worry, with me here, no one will dare to cause trouble for You!””

“Feng Xianxian lowered her head. “It’s nothing, it’s really nothing!””

“Feng Qianhua handed the health soup to Old Lady Lin. “Aunt Lin, don’t listen to this girl’s nonsense! Let’s Drink the Soup First!””

“Old Lady Lin did not reach out to take it. She just looked at Feng Xianxian. “Xianxian, quickly tell Grandma!””

“Feng Xianxian’s face was full of hesitation. She raised her head to look at Feng Qianhua, then quickly lowered her head. “Grandma, it’s really nothing! Don’t ask!””

Old Madam Lin looked at Feng Qianhua. “Is there anything that an old woman like me can’t Know? You’re not allowed to scare the child! Let Xianxian speak!”

Feng Qianhua sighed and did not say anything.

“Old Madam Lin turned to look at Feng Xianxian again. “Xianxian, hurry up and speak, or else grandma won’t like you anymore!””

“Hearing this, Feng Xianxian’s face turned pale and she immediately said, “I’ll speak! I’ll speak!””

Only then was Old Lady Lin Satisfied.

“Feng Xianxian continued, “That’s right, that’s right, searing has a boyfriend outside...””

Boyfriend?

“Hearing this, Old Lady Lin frowned slightly.”

Ye searing actually found a boyfriend?

When did this happen?

Why didn’t she know about it at all?

“Feng Xianxian hugged Old Lady Lin’s arm and began to act coquettishly. “Grandma, I heard that Searing’s boyfriend is really outstanding. I’m really envious of her! Searing is beautiful, and the boyfriend he found is also outstanding. He’s simply a winner in life!””

Old Lady Lin did not notice the ridicule in Feng Xianxian’s eyes.

Feng Xianxian deliberately raised ye Zha’s boyfriend High and mighty.

“After all, the greater the hope, the greater the disappointment.”

She was really looking forward to Old Lady Lin seeing that old man’s scene.

That scene would definitely be very exciting.

“Old Lady Lin continued, “Where is the man from?””

“Feng Xianxian shook her head. “I’m not too sure about that either, but Zha Zha Zha has such good taste. The boyfriend he found must not be bad either.””

Old Lady Lin frowned.

She was very unhappy.

“Ye Zao was looking for a boyfriend outside. As a grandmother, she actually did not know about it.”

“Feng Qianhua smiled and said, “Aunt Lin, it’s your birthday the day after tomorrow. Why don’t we take advantage of your birthday and have searing bring her boyfriend back so that we can all have a look at her? “Anyway, girls have to get married anyway. If the man’s condition is really that good, we can settle the marriage earlier.””
