Chapter 165: 087: tearing the mistress apart, divorce! 1

Cheating was not worthy of being forgiven! Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Moreover, an Dongliang had done it again and again.

It was already good for him to leave everything behind.

After all, an Lizi’s mother had sacrificed nearly 20 years of her youth.

Hearing this, an Lizi looked up at Ye Zhuo.

She was stunned.

Divorce?

From the moment her father had cheated on her, she had never thought that her parents would want a divorce.

She still wanted to get back at her father...

“Zha Zha...”

Ye Zha continued, “Lizi, can you tell us about Auntie?”

An Lizi nodded and started to talk about Xia Xiaoman with tears in her eyes.

No one knew Xia Xiaoman better than her daughter, an Lizi.

......

As she spoke, an Lizi cried even more sadly.

Xia Xiaoman had sacrificed the best years of her youth for an Dongliang, and now that she was old and frail, an Dongliang had betrayed her.

In this world, there was nothing more pathetic than this.

“Your father is too much!”Zhao Pingting was so angry that she slammed the table and stood up. “He’s a piece of trash! Such a piece of trash doesn’t deserve to be your father! He’s even more unworthy of your mother!”

Zhao Pingting was really angry.

What was the difference between an Dongliang and Chen Shimei?

Unfortunately, Xia Xiaoman was still foolishly kept in the dark.

Zhao Pingting realized that her words might have gone a little overboard. After all, an Dongliang was still an Lizi’s father. She continued, “Lizi, I’m not doing this to anyone! Don’t Worry!”

Ye Zhuo bought three cups of milk tea from the side and passed them to an Lizi and Zhao Pingting respectively, “Lizi, your mother is a very strong and kind woman. She has sacrificed too much for your family. If you keep this a secret, it’s not for your mother’s good, but to harm her! “As a wife and a mother, she has the right to know about this

“What if my mother can’t bear the blow when she finds out about this? “I’ve consulted an expert before, and that expert told me that as a child, it’s best not to interfere in the matters between parents, so I’ve kept it a secret... ”... ”...”

Ye Zhuo frowned slightly. “Are you sure the person you consulted is an expert?”

An Lizi nodded.

Zhao pingting retorted, “What bullshit expert! I think she’s just misleading people’s children! Don’t tell me you’re keeping this a secret. I hope that her husband will have an affair in the future, and her daughter will meet an expert just like her!”

Ye Zhuo continued, “There’s something wrong with this expert’s thinking. To put it bluntly, she doesn’t have a correct view of the world. A normal person wouldn’t protect a mistress and an unfaithful man! “You have to understand how much your mother has sacrificed for this family all these years!”

After saying that, ye Zao asked again, “Lizi, are you afraid that your mother will jump off the building or something else will happen?”

An Lizi sighed and nodded.

Ye Zao said, “Lizi, your mother is an adult now. It’s said that women are originally weak, but a mother is strong. Her ability to resist pressure is far beyond your imagination!”

“Do you mean that my mother will not let go?”An Lizi was like a drowning person, grasping at a life-saving straw.

“No! You have to believe in your mother. She is a very strong person. She will definitely not seek death just because of a man!”Since Xia Xiaoman was able to start from scratch in Yunjing alone.., this meant that she was not a weak woman. She would definitely not do something stupid.

Ye Zhuo continued, “In the end, you can’t hide the truth. If you keep covering up for your father and keeping it from your mother, one day, when your mother finds out the truth, she will really be upset!”

“Lizi, you have to know that your mother carried you for ten months and gave birth to you after much hard work. In this family, you are your mother’s only family! “You have to learn to protect your mother. When she encounters setbacks and betrayals, you should stand on the same side as her, and not think of ways to protect your father! “You will make your mother feel that you and your father are one family, and she is an outsider from the beginning to the end! “Once you reach that stage, you might really lose her forever!”

Ye Zhuo was not being alarmist.

Xia Xiaoman was the victim now!

She had sacrificed so much for this family. If one day, she found out that her husband and daughter had betrayed her at the same time, the consequences would be unimaginable.

A woman’s twenty years of hard work had come to naught in the end.

Even a bystander felt sorrowful hearing this.

Anlizi panicked and shook her head desperately. “No! It’s not like that! I didn’t want to treat my mother as an outsider, no...”
