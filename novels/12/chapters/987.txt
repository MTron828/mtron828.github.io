“MMM.”Auntie Lang nodded.

“Xi Weiyue held Auntie Lang’s arm. “Auntie, thank you.” ”

Auntie Lang patted Xi Weiyue’s hand.

“At this moment, Xi Muwen walked over and said, “Weiyue, I want to talk to Your Auntie.” ”

“MMM.”Xi Weiyue nodded.

“After XI Weiyue left, only Xi Muwen and Aunt Lang were left in the room. ”

“Xi Muwen poured a glass of water for Aunt Lang. “Lang Hua, ever since Little Half Moon went missing, the two of us have been strangers. It’s been many years since we sat down together to chat.” ”

Aunt Lang took the water. “What do you want to say?”

“Ever since Little Half Moon went missing, she and Xi Muwen had no common topics to talk about. ”

“Xi muwen said, “Let’s talk about Little Half Moon.” ”

“When she mentioned Little Half Moon, Aunt Lang’s expression softened a little. ”

“XI muwen continued, “You’ve seen Little Half Moon’s current situation. She really can’t be stimulated by anything anymore. After so many years, I haven’t fulfilled a single day of my father’s responsibilities, so in the time that follows, I want to accompany Little Half Moon well. I hope you can give me this opportunity.” ”

“”I want to bring little half moon to the courtyard house. The Doctor said that her condition can be fully recovered if she recuperates,”Auntie Lang did not hide her thoughts. ”

The XI family was not suitable for little half moon to live in.

“Xi Muwen sighed, “Lang Hua, do you have to do this? “Little Half Moon is my daughter after all. My blood flows through her body. “All these years, I’ve been living in self-blame. I’ve been dreaming of finding Little Half Moon, and I hope you can give me a chance to atone for my sins.” ”

“Aunt Lang looked up at Xi Muwen. “I lost Little Half Moon, and it has nothing to do with you. You Don’t have to blame yourself. I’m the one who should blame myself, and I’m the one who should repent.” ”

“”Lang Hua,”xi muwen continued, “Don’t say that. I’m Little Half Moon’s father, and I’m also responsible for losing Little Half Moon. This isn’t your fault alone.” ”

“”Forget it. Let bygones be bygones.”Aunt Lang stood up from her chair. “I’ll bring Little Half Moon here for a few days. After she gets used to me, we’ll move to the courtyard house.” ”

“Must we move?”Xi Muwen stood up and asked.

Aunt Lang nodded.

“Xi Muwen sighed. “Then, I’ll respect your decision.” ”

“Aunty Lang stood up. “If there’s nothing else, I’ll go downstairs first.” ”

“Okay.”Xi Muwen nodded and followed Aunty Lang’s footsteps. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The two of them went downstairs together.

“Little Half Moon was originally chatting with Yang Jiao, but when she saw Aunty Lang come down, she was so scared that she immediately hid behind Yang Jiao. ”

Aunty Lang’s eyes reddened.

“Yang Jiao comforted little half moon. “Don’t be afraid, she’s your mother! She’s the person who loves you the most in this world.” ”

“Half a moon hid behind Yang Jiao, her whole body trembling. ”

“Aunt Lang walked up to Yang Jiao. “Half a moon, don’t worry, Mommy Won’t hurt you. Can you look up at Mommy?” ”

“”No, no!”Half a moon tugged on Yang Jiao’s sleeve. “You’re a bad person! A bad person!” ”

A bad person?

Yes.

She was a bad person.

“Aunt Lang sighed deeply. Not only was she a bad person, she was also an incompetent mother. ”

The reason why the second half of the month had become like this was entirely because of her.

“”It’s always like this in the beginning.”Xi Muwen walked over and patted Aunt Lang’s shoulder. “Don’t think too much. In a few days, she’ll stick to you. You have to be patient with your child.” ”

“MMM.”Aunt Lang nodded.

“Xi Muwen smiled at half a month and reached out his hand to her. “Half a month, Daddy will take you to buy candy, okay?” ”

Half Moon looked up at Yang Jiao.

“Yang Jiao said softly, “Your Daddy will take you to buy candy. Go quickly. Don’t be afraid, he won’t hit you.” ”

Half Moon then walked over to Xi Muwen’s side.

Xi Muwen held Half Moon’s hand and walked over to Auntie Lang. “Let’s take the child out for a walk together?”

“Okay.”

“Just as Auntie Lang reached Half Moon, Half Moon broke away from Xi Muwen’s hand and quickly ran behind Yang Jiao. “Ah! Bad Person! There’s a bad person!” ”

“Yang Jiao said helplessly, “She’s not a bad person. She’s your mother.” ”

“Bad Person!”

“Yang Jiao looked at Aunt Lang. “Sister, this child isn’t sensible. Don’t be angry.” ”

“Aunt Lang shook her head. At this moment, the phone in her pocket suddenly rang. Aunt Lang picked up the call. “Hello.” ”

“”Aunt Lang, it’s Cao Wei.” ”

“What’s the matter?”

“Cao Wei continued, “I’ve found some clues regarding the matter of half a month. I’d like to meet you to chat.” ”

“There’s no need to chat.”Aunt Lang tried her best to take a deep breath. “I’ve already found half a month.”

“”You’ve found it?”Cao Wei said, “It was Xi Muwen who helped you find it?” ”

“MMM.”Aunt Lang did not deny it.

“”Aunt Lang, this Xi Muwen has ulterior motives. He’s been scheming against you from the start. Please don’t believe his words! The person he found is definitely not your biological daughter!” ”
