“Chapter 963: 219: Cen Yuyan finally came to her senses. Dog Bites Dog, a mouthful of fur! 6”

Translator: 549690339

Disgusting.

It was really too disgusting.

Cen Yuyan was very confused. Why would she sleep with such a person for such a long time?

“Zhou Rui thought that Cen Yuyan was pregnant and immediately patted Cen Yuyan’s back. “Are You Alright, Yuyan?” ”

“I’m fine.”Cen Yuyan shook her head.

Zhou Rui helped Cen Yuyan into the car.

“Soon, the car stopped in front of the Civil Affairs Bureau. ”

“In order to show his sincerity, Zhou Rui transferred all his assets and real estate to Cen Yuyan in the divorce agreement. ”

“The Civil Affairs Bureau staff looked at the two of them. “If the two of you have no objections to the agreement, Please Sign It.” ”

Zhou Rui signed it without hesitation.

Cen Yuyan also signed it.

Cen Yuyan heaved a sigh of relief when she successfully received the divorce agreement.

The entire process was much smoother than she had imagined.

“Zhou Rui held the divorce certificate and smiled. “Yuyan, shall I send you back now?” ”

“Cen Yuyan pretended to be reluctant and said, “I still want to accompany you for a while.” ”

Accompany Him?

Zhou Rui did not need Cen Yuyan to accompany him.

He felt disgusted whenever he saw Cen Yuyan now.

“”Yuyan, now is not the time to accompany me. You Go back first and tell mom about our divorce.” ”

Cen Yuyan hesitated for a moment and nodded.”... Alright then.”

“I’ll send you back.”Zhou Rui pulled Cen Yuyan’s hand.

“Cen Yuyan smiled and said, “You should be very busy now, right? I don’t need you to send me off. I’ll walk around alone first. I’ll get the chauffeur to pick me up later. You Go do your work quickly.” ”

Zhou Rui just happened to not want to accompany Cen Yuyan. “Then I’ll be leaving first. Send me a message when you get home.”

“Cen Yuyan nodded. “Don’t worry, I will.” ”

Zhou Rui drove off.

Cen Yuyan looked in the direction where the car had disappeared and narrowed her eyes.

Three days later.

“Early in the morning, Father Zhou was woken up by Mother Zhou’s voice. ”

“Father Zhou said unhappily, “It’s so early in the morning. Why Are You Howling?” ”

“Mother Zhou was so frightened that her face turned white. She walked over and said, “Quickly come over and take a look! See What’s posted outside the door!” ”

Father Zhou followed mother Zhou to the door.

They saw a notice from the court pasted on the front door of the villa.

“It was written in black and white on the notice that this villa had already been mortgaged to the bank. The court had limited them to move out of the villa within half a month. Otherwise, they would not be forced to do so. ”

“When Father Zhou saw this flyer, he was stunned. He immediately picked up his phone and called Zhou Rui. ”

“He called many times, but Zhou Rui did not pick up the phone. ”

“In fact, the situation on Zhou Rui’s side was the same as Father Zhou’s. ”

“Just as he was about to leave, he saw the court notice next to the door. ”

“The court had given him half a month to move out. Otherwise, he would be forced to do so. ”

Zhou Rui was scared silly.

Didn’t Cen Yuyan say that Zhou Xiang was just testing him?

Then why did the court seal the house?

“Zhou Rui quickly took out his phone to call Cen Yuyan, but the other party was on a busy line. ”

“Obviously, he was blocked. ”

Zhou Rui opened wechat again.

Cen Yuyan’s name was no longer on wechat’s friend list.

He opened other social media accounts.

The results were the same.

Cen Yuyan seemed to have vanished from the face of the Earth.

“This time, Zhou Rui really panicked. ”

“Just as he was about to call song Chenyu, he received a call from Father Zhou. Upon hearing Father Zhou’s words, Zhou Rui collapsed to the ground. ”

The villa had also been notified by the court.

“At this moment, Zhou Rui received countless reminders on his phone. ”

These loan sharks were all borrowed by Cen Yuyan with their marriage certificates and his identity cards.

Zhou Rui took a rough look. All the loan sharks added up to more than 60 million yuan.

“Seeing this number, Zhou Rui’s face turned pale. Her instincts told her that Cen Yuyan was not playing around with him. ”

What should she do?

What should she do now?

“In his panic, Zhou Rui quickly took out his phone and called Song Chenyu. After explaining the situation, song Chenyu said, “Don’t be anxious. Maybe Cen Yuyan and Zhou Xiang are testing you. I’ll contact her right away.” ”

“After hanging up, song Chenyu immediately contacted Cen Yuyan. ” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Very soon, CEN Yuyan picked up the call. “Hello.” ”

“Song Chenyu hurriedly said, “Yuyan, where are you now?” ”

“What’s Wrong?”

Cen Yuyan’s voice was a little cold.

“Song Chenyu could hear that something was wrong with Cen Yuyan’s voice and frowned slightly. “Yuyan, what’s Wrong?” ”

“Cen Yuyan’s lips curled into a mocking smile. “Song Chenyu, don’t you think you’re disgusting?” ”

Song Chenyu’s heart thumped. “Yuyan...”
