“Bai Wei smiled and said, “It’s not hard. I’m just here to make trouble. I cooked all the dishes on this table.” ”

Ye Sen just looked at Bai Wei.

“If everything she did was an act, then she was too scary. ”

How did she do it?

“Bai Wei touched her face. “Ye Sen, why are you looking at me like that? Is there something dirty on my face?” ”

“”No.”Ye Sen tried his best to look away and said, “Let’s eat. You and sister have been busy all morning.” ”

“Okay.”Bai Wei nodded.

“During the meal, Ye Sen naturally gave the first drumstick to ye Zao. ”

“When Ye Sen was getting the second drumstick, Bai Wei thought that Ye Sen was going to give the drumstick to her, but ye sen directly gave the drumstick to Ye Shu. ”

Bai Wei furrowed her brows without leaving a trace.

“There was a drumstick that was not given to his girlfriend, but given to two outsiders? ”

What was going on?

And the mother and daughter were also shameless.

“Living in someone else’s house, they actually had the face to eat the drumstick. ”

And they even ate it with peace of mind.

Bai Wei suddenly had a disgusting feeling of eating a fly.

Wait! DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“When she married into the Ye family, she told the mother and daughter to get as far away as possible. ”

“At this moment, Ye Sen picked up a chicken wing and put it into Bai Wei’s bowl. ”

“Thank you.”Bai Wei looked up at Ye Sen.

“Eat quickly.”

“After eating, Ye Sen sent Bai Wei back. ”

In the car.

“Bai Wei said worriedly, “Ye Sen, I feel that your sister and your niece don’t like me.” ”

“”You’re wrong. They don’t dislike you,”Ye Sen said. ”

“Really?”

“Yes.”Ye Sen nodded.

“Seeing that ye Sen’s expression didn’t change, Bai Wei heaved a sigh of relief. ”

“Soon, the car stopped at the entrance of Bai Wei’s neighborhood. ”

“I’m here.”Bai Wei opened the car door and got out.

Ye Sen turned to look at her. “I happen to have nothing to do in the afternoon. Let’s go to your house and have a cup of tea.”

“Bai Wei said, “My roommate is at home. We made a promise to each other not to bring the opposite sex back! How about next time?” ”

“Okay.”Ye Sen nodded.

Bai Wei did not notice that a strange look flashed in Ye Sen’s eyes.

“”Then you have to be safe on the road. I’ll Contact You When we get home,”Bai Wei said. ”

“Okay.”Ye Sen closed the car door and drove away.

Bai Wei waited until she could not see ye Sen’s car before she turned around and walked to the other side.

“Little did she know that after she left, the car that had already disappeared from her view turned back at this time. ”

“Ye Sen sat in the driver’s seat, his fingers tightly gripping the steering wheel. Because he had used too much force, his knuckles had turned slightly white. ”

Yes.

Ye Zao was right.

Bai Wei did not live in this neighborhood at all.

“Even her address was fake, what else was real? ”

Ye Sen could not tell what he was feeling at the moment. He started the engine and turned the car around.

Not long after.

The car stopped in front of an office building.

Bai Wei’s dance class was in this teaching building.

Ye Sen walked to the service center of the office building. “May I know if you have a dance teacher named Bai Wei Here?”

“The customer service staff said, “Wait a moment, I’ll check for you.” ”

“After about three minutes, the customer service staff continued, “Sir, we don’t have a dance teacher named Bai Wei here.” ”

“”Okay, I got it.”Ye Sen nodded. ”

“After coming out of the office building, Ye Sen had an indescribable expression on his face. He immediately drove back. ”

At the Ye residence.

Ye Shu was cleaning the living room.

“When she saw Ye Sen return, Ye Shu looked up at him. “You’re back.” ”

“Yeah.”Ye Sen nodded.

“Ye Shu continued, “Ye Sen, I don’t think Bai Wei is a good girl.”Ye Shu had originally prepared a bracelet for Bai Wei, but after spending the whole morning together, she gave up the idea of gifting the bracelet. ”

“Ye Sen sighed. “Sister, I might have really misjudged her! By the way, where’s Zhuo Zhuo?” ”

“In the room.”

Ye Sen walked to Ye Zhuo’s room and knocked on the door.

“The door isn’t closed.”Ye Zhuo’s voice came from inside.

Ye Sen pushed the door open and entered.

“Ye Zhuo was sitting on the bay window, with a pile of disassembled parts in front of him. ”

“My niece.”

“”Huh?”Ye Zao raised his eyes slightly. “How is it, uncle? Have you verified what I Said?” ”

“Ye Sen nodded. “I’m thinking now, who is Bai Wei? Is it possible that even her name is fake!” ”

Her address was fake.

Her occupation was fake.

Bai Wei really disappointed ye Sen!

“”It’s not impossible,”ye Zao said. ”

“Ye Sen continued, “Big niece, help me check! I know you must have this ability.”Ye Sen had always known that ye Zao was particularly talented in computer science! ”
