“You Don’t want to admit it, right?”

“When she saw the irrefutable evidence, how could Bai Xiaosu continue to quibble!”

“After filling out all the information, Zheng Wanyin also walked out.”

Time passed quickly. It was only two hours later.

Zheng Wanyin once again came to the notary office.

“The CEO, the seven examiners, and Ye Zhuo had all arrived.”

“The CEO looked at Ye Zao apologetically. “Miss Ye, I’m really sorry for making a fool of myself.”She had originally wanted to invite ye Zao to be the chief examiners, but she had not expected that ye Zao would be implicated and questioned by others.”

“It’s fine.”Ye Zao’s expression remained the same.

“The CEO apologized again and again. “Don’t worry. After this matter is over, I will definitely give you a satisfactory answer.””

“At this moment, the door was pushed open again.”

It was Liu Jing Jing who had arrived with the core team.

“”CEO, everyone from our core team is here today. Please handle this impartially!””

The CEO frowned slightly. “Why are you all here to join in the fun?”It was not embarrassing enough!

This was the ABA that he managed!

These were his members!

Cold Heart!

“Liu Jingjing continued, “CEO, True Gold is not afraid of fire. If the assessment papers are really fine, why are you afraid of US standing here?””

Ye Zhuo looked back slightly. “Let them stay.”

The CEO nodded.

“Looking at Ye Zhuo, Zheng Wanyin’s eyes were filled with disdain.”

What was there to pretend!

What was there for ye Zhuo to pretend!

“At this moment, Xie Wanqiu brought Zhou Xiang and the rest to the notary office.”

“Zhou Xiang still did not know the whole story and asked curiously, “Mom, why did you bring me here?””

Xie wanqiu glanced at Zhou Xiang. “What’s the rush! You’ll know soon enough.”

“Seeing Xie wanqiu like this, old madam Cen wanted to say something to Cen Shaoqing.”

She took a look.

She could not help but vent her anger.

Why was this brat so tall?

He was standing there like a telephone pole. It was difficult for him to even whisper to her.

There wasn’t a small stool here for her to stand on.

Old Mrs. Cen was unhappy. She reached out and tugged at CEN Shaoqing’s sleeve. “Brat.”

Cen Shaoqing lowered his eyes slightly.

“”Bend down,”old Mrs. Cen said.”

Cen Shaoqing bent down as he was told.

“”Bend down,”continued old Mrs. Cen.”

Cen Shaoqing still did as he was told.

“Looking at Cen Shaoqing who was as tall as her, old Mrs. Cen was finally satisfied and leaned into CEN Shaoqing’s ear, she lowered her voice and said, “You fake grandmother is going to cause trouble again! I’m telling you! No matter what happens, you have to stand on Yezi’s side unconditionally! You Can’t be a scumbag like me!””

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “If you dare to be a scumbag, I’ll break your legs and Smash Your Head!””

“”Got it, Grandma.”Cen Shaoqing opened his thin lips and said, “Don’t worry, your granddaughter-in-law won’t be bullied so easily.””

“Hearing that, old Mrs. Cen said with a proud face, “Of course! How can the granddaughter-in-law that I personally picked be bad?””

“Xie wanqiu noticed that old Mrs. Cen was whispering to Cen Shaoqing, and she became more and more dissatisfied.”

“Did these two people still put her, this grandmother, in their eyes?”

And Cen Shaoqing!

He was actually so close to an outsider!

She was Cen Shaoqing’s grandmother.

“If it weren’t for her, would there be Zhou Xiang?”

“If it weren’t for Zhou Xiang, would there be Cen Shaoqing?”

“Bai Tang, this old slut, had led her grandson astray. If not for the old slut, Cen Shaoqing would not be so distant from her now.”

The old slut must have said a lot of bad things about her in front of Cen Shaoqing.

“Thinking of this, Xie Wanqiu was extremely angry.”

Old Slut!

Just wait!

“The examination papers were going to be taken out soon. Once it was confirmed that ye Zhuo had cheated and encouraged evil, she wanted to see how Bai Tang would have the face to continue staying here!”

“”Bai Xiaosu, Zheng Wanyin.”At this moment, the chief executive called out the names of these two people.” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Bai Xiaosu and Zheng Wanyin walked out from the crowd.

“The chief executive continued, “Bai Xiaosu, Zheng Wanyin suspects that there’s something wrong with your results. You collaborated with the Chief Examiner to steal her examination results. May I ask if you have any doubts about this?””

“Bai Xiaosu said, “I’ve never done such a thing.””

The chief executive turned to look at Zheng Wanyin. “What About You?”

“Zheng wanyin said, “Chief executive, facts speak louder than words. I request to see the assessment papers.””

“Hearing that, the crowd at the side immediately jeered, “Assessment Papers! Assessment Papers! We request to see the assessment papers! Return Zheng Wanyin a fair and just result!””

Plagiarism and cheating were the most intolerable existences.

“Seeing this scene, Zhou Xiang’s expression changed. who was the main examiner?”
