“Fifth Girl?”

“Cough Cough Guest!”Cen Shaoqing almost choked to death on his own saliva.

“Seeing him like this, Ye Zhuo was amused. “So you really were called fifth girl when you were young.” ”

“Although Cen Shaoqing did not want to admit it, he still nodded. “Grandma Told You That?” ”

Cen Shaoqing was the Cen family’s fifth child.

“Because he was not in good health when he was young, Old Lady Cen gave him the nickname of a girl. At that time, there was a rumor in his hometown that it was easy to raise a boy with a girl’s name. ”

“Therefore, the name of the fifth girl accompanied Cen Shaoqing throughout his childhood. ”

It had been twenty years since anyone had called him that.

He did not expect ye Zhuo to know about it.

“Ye Zhuo laughed so hard that tears were streaming down his face. “Fifth Lass, isn’t your name a little too cute? I’ll just call you that from now on!” ”

Cen Shaoqing:”...”

“A moment later, Cen Shaoqing turned to look at Ye Zhuo. “Are you serious?” ”

Ye Zhuo nodded very seriously.

Cen Shaoqing hesitated for a moment before discussing with ye Zhuo. “Then can you only call me that when there’s no one around?”

“Ye Zhuo said in all seriousness, “No.” ”

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Then can you lower your voice?” ”

“No.”

“Cen Shaoqing sighed softly. “Alright then, as long as you’re happy.” ”

“”Fifth lass, your expression seems a little forced?”Ye Zhuo turned to look at Cen Shaoqing. ”

Cen Shaoqing pursed his lips. “You’re mistaken.”

“Ye Zhuo chuckled. “Alright, Alright. Fifth Lass, I’m just joking with you! Don’t worry, I’ll only call you fifth lass in the future. I’ll definitely give you face in front of others.” ”

Cen Shaoqing:”...”the fifth lass was a joke.

...

At the same time.

Lin Group.

“Lin Jin Cheng was dealing with official business. Secretary Zhang stood behind him. Recalling old Madam Cen’s instructions, he said in a low voice, “Director Lin, you haven’t returned home for almost a month and a half.” ”

“Hearing this, Lin Jincheng’s eyes were filled with self-mockery. ”

Home?

Could that cold and heartless place really be called home?

“Most of the time, he preferred to stay in the sanatorium. ”

Lin Jincheng massaged his temples and felt a headache. It was as if there was something important in his mind that was leaving him bit by bit.

“Seeing Lin Jincheng like this, secretary Zhang’s heart skipped a beat and his eyes were filled with guilt. ”

What should have come had come.

Sorry.

He had let Lin Down.

“”Lin, are you feeling unwell again?”Secretary Zhang poured a glass of water for Lin Jincheng. ”

“I don’t remember. I don’t seem to remember Ah Ze’s mother again.”Lin Jincheng’s face was full of pain.

“Secretary Zhang took a deep breath. “Lin, there’s your diary in the safe. Go take a look and you’ll remember everything. I’ll go get it for you.” ”

“The next second, the diary was handed to Lin Jincheng. ”

Lin Jincheng took the diary.

The memories in the diary were familiar yet unfamiliar.

Feng Qianhua?

“Ah Ze’s mother is Feng Qianhua?”Lin Jincheng raised his head to look at Secretary Zhang.

Secretary Zhang nodded. “Yes.”

“Lin Jincheng continued, “Then why is Xianxian surnamed Feng?” ”

“Secretary zhang said, “It’s written in these diary. You’ll understand once you read further.” ”

Lin Jincheng continued reading the diary.

The scenes of the past appeared in front of his eyes.

But Feng Qianhua’s face didn’t match the face of the woman in the diary.

What was going on?

Lin Jincheng’s face was full of pain.

“He didn’t love Feng Qianhua at all, so how could he have a son and a daughter with Feng Qianhua? ”

Something was wrong.

Something was definitely wrong.

“Lin Jincheng pressed his temples with both hands and tried his best to think about the past, but other than the words in the diary, he couldn’t remember anything else. ”

Could it be that he had really let Feng Qianhua down?

“”Secretary Zhang, please leave for a moment.” ”

“Secretary Zhang nodded. “If there’s anything, you can call me anytime.” ”

Secretary Zhang went outside and called Old Madam Lin to inform her of Lin Jincheng’s current situation.

“Upon hearing this, Old Madam Lin was very happy. “Secretary Zhang, you’ve done very well in this matter. Also, the professor from country P has gone to the hospital today.” ”

“”Thank you, Old Mrs. Lin,”secretary Zhang said bitterly. ”

“After ye Zhuo left, the Cen sisters also brought their own gifts home. ”

“Although Cen Yuyan was not married yet, she did not live in the old house. ”

“Because she disliked the things that ye Zhuo gave her as street goods, after Cen Yuyan returned to her residence, she did not even open them. She handed them to the nanny. “Throw this away.” ”

“The nanny hesitated. “Fourth miss, this box hasn’t been opened yet. Are you sure you want to throw it away?” ”
