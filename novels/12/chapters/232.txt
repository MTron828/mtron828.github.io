Chapter 233: 093: shocking everyone! Old Lady Cen tearing apart the scum! 4

Translator: 549690339

Ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing were evenly matched existences.

The two experts were not suited to be together at all.

“Neither of them was inferior to the other. If they were forced to be together, there would definitely be conflicts in the future! ”

Most importantly.

Cen Shaoqing was a vegetarian.

And Ye Zhuo was a vegetarian.

How could cen Shaoqing tolerate the person next to him eating meat?

“So, Mu Yourong was more suitable for CEN Shaoqing. ”

Mu Yourong smiled a little embarrassedly. “How can someone like me be worthy of Fifth Master?”

Li Qiandong was stunned.

So Mu Yourong had voluntarily broken off the engagement because she felt that she was not worthy of Cen Shaoqing?

Then she was too kind!

“Li Qiandong continued, “Yourong, you’re very good. You must not belittle yourself.” ”

“Really?”Mu Yourong raised her head to look at Li Qiandong.

“Li Qiandong nodded very seriously, “You are the kindest and most simple girl I know. “Fifth brother is the same as you. He has always been a vegetarian all these years. You are simply a perfect match for him. “It’s just that fifth brother’s personality is sometimes a little stubborn. It’s very difficult to see the essence through appearances.” ”

“If Cen Shaoqing could see the essence through appearances, then he wouldn’t have such a deep misunderstanding of Mu Yourong. ”

“Now that Cen Shaoqing had such a deep misunderstanding of Mu Yourong, he couldn’t let mu yourong have any more misunderstandings of Cen Shaoqing. ”

As Cen Shaoqing’s best friend.

Li Qiandong couldn’t just watch as Cen Shaoqing missed Mu Yourong.

Misunderstandings would one day be resolved.

“If he missed out on his whole life because of this misunderstanding, it would not be worth it. ”

“”Big Brother Li, thank you for thinking so highly of me.” ”

“With Li Qiandong’s words, Mu Yourong felt much more at ease. ”

What kind of person was fifth master Cen?

He either had a pure heart and few desires for his entire life.

“Once he fell in love with someone, he would give up everything and be willing to pay everything for her! ”

“From Li Qiandong’s words, it was not difficult to deduce that the reason fifth master Cen had not come to confess his feelings to her was probably because he had not thought of how to face this matter ”

Because in Mu Yourong’s memories from her previous life.

“Until her death, the legendary fifth master Cen did not have a family. ”

“From the very beginning, he had wanted to be alone for the rest of his life. If he suddenly met someone he wanted to spend the rest of his life with, he would definitely be at a loss. ”

Mu Yourong believed that it would not be long before fifth master Cen would take the initiative to look for her!

“The more Mu Yourong thought about it, the more excited she became, and her heartbeat quickened. ”

...

“After the meeting was over, Cen Shaoqing suggested sending ye Zhuo back. ”

Ye Zhuo did not refuse. “Then I’ll have to trouble you.”

“”It’s on the way,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

They got into the car.

“Ye Zhuo said, “Fifth brother, this gown must be worth quite a lot, right? Send me your account number, and I’ll transfer the money to you.” ”

She did not want to owe cen Shaoqing a favor.

Cen Shaoqing held the prayer beads in one hand and controlled the steering wheel with one hand. “It’s just a dress. You Don’t have to take it to heart.”

“”If you don’t give me your account number, I’ll transfer the money to your company account.”Ye Zao’s tone was indifferent. ”

Cen Shaoqing had never given anything to the opposite sex before.

This was the first time.

He did not expect to be rejected.

“Cen Shaoqing pressed his temples helplessly and looked at Ye Zhuo. “The official website of our group’s branch company is currently being hacked. If you want to thank me, why don’t you help me take a look?” ”

“”Sure, no problem.”Ye Zhuo continued, “When you go back, send me an account number.” ”

“Okay.”

“After going home, Ye Zhuo had just taken a shower when he received the account number and password from Cen Shaoqing. ”

“After logging in, Ye Zhuo realized that this was the main account password of the company. ”

Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly.

Did he trust her that much?

Cen Shaoqing did not look like the kind of person who did not know the gravity of the situation.

Ye Zhuo wiped his hair with a towel while typing on the keyboard.

Countless English letters poured out from her fingertips and appeared on the computer screen.

“Line after line, it was dazzling. ” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

After two brief exchanges.

“Ye Zao realized that the other party was not one person, but a five-person team. ”

And they cooperated very well.

It was also because the CEN Group’s firewall was more advanced.

“In addition, the crisis public relations team was very strong. Otherwise, under such an attack, they would not have been able to defend until today! ”

“Ten minutes later, Ye Zhuo turned off his computer and sent a message to CEN Shaoqing. [ the hacker problem has been solved. At the same time, the firewall has been strengthened. If there are any problems, you can contact me again. ] ”

[ thank you. ]

[ you’re welcome. ]

Cen Shaoqing unhurriedly edited the text and sent it over. [ it’s getting late. Rest early. Good night. ]
