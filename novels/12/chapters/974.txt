“Chapter 975: 221: a dragon has a reverse scale, it will be enraged if it is touched! 4”

Aunt Lang passed the phone to XI Weiyue with red eyes.

“XI weiyue said, “Dad, let’s not talk about it now. I’m hanging up.” ”

“After hanging up the phone, Xi Weiyue turned to look at Aunt Lang and said with a smile, “How is it, Aunt? Am I right? My dad already has news of Sister Half Moon.” ”

“”MMM.”Aunt Lang nodded. “Weiyue, thank you.” ”

“XI weiyue said, “Why are you thanking me? Half Moon is my sister. I hope to find her as soon as possible, just like you.” ”

“Now, not only did she hear Half Moon’s news from Cao Wei, Auntie Lang’s heart was filled with hope. ”

“She believed that one day, she would find Half Moon. ”

She would definitely find half moon!

It was already past three in the afternoon when they returned from Auntie Lang’s place.

At the XI residence.

“Yang Jiao sat on the sofa, applying nail polish. The air was filled with the faint fragrance of flowers. ”

It smelled very nice.

“When she saw this scene, Xi Weiyue frowned slightly. “Mother, it’s been so long. Have you not found a suitable candidate at the aid station?” ”

“It was fine that Yang Jiao was not in a hurry to find someone, but she had the leisure to apply nail polish elegantly. ”

Yang jiao blew on her freshly painted nails. “Finding someone isn’t as easy as just saying a word. How can it be that simple?”

“Although the major aid stations would take in homeless vagrants every day, Yang Jiao had searched for so long, but she couldn’t find anything suitable. ”

“First, she needed to be of a suitable age. Second, she needed to look passable. After all, Ye Langhua wasn’t an ordinary person. If her daughter was too ugly, it wouldn’t make sense. ”

“Most importantly, she could not be too smart for the third task. ”

It was not easy to control someone who was too smart!

“XI weiyue continued, “I’m afraid that it’ll be too late! Coincidentally, I have nothing to do this afternoon. Why don’t we go to the rescue station to take a look?” ”

“Now?”Yang Jiao was a little unhappy.

“In the afternoon, she had even arranged to play cards with a group of rich ladies. ”

“In the first few days, Yang Jiao was quite active. She went to the rescue station almost every day, but after searching for so long, she still could not find a suitable candidate. Yang Jiao did not have much confidence in this matter. ”

“Xi Weiyue looked up at Yang Jiao. “Mom, don’t You Want Me to join the financial world and become a member of Shunxi Financial Group?” ”

“When she heard the words “Shunxi Financial Group”, Yang Jiao immediately stood up and said, “Let’s go, let’s Go Now!” ”

She could not go against anyone or money.

“When XI Weiyue successfully joined Shunxi Financial Group, other than the Cen family, no one else in the capital would dare to look down on them! ”

“Even though XI empire was still doing well, Xi Muwen’s reputation was not that good. ”

“After all, before this, Xi Empire’s surname was Ye. ”

“If XI Muwen had not used such underhanded methods, would ye corporation suddenly become Xi Empire? ”

“However, if Xi Weiyue could successfully join the Shunxi Corporation, it would be like standing in the Golden House of the business world. When that happened, the entire XI empire would shine. ”

“At this moment, Yang Jiao received a message and turned to XI Weiyue. “Weiyue, let’s go to the aid station at 987 man Xi Ring Road.” ”

“Xi weiyue asked in confusion, “Why are we going there?” ”

“Yang Jiao continued, “Just now, the volunteer sent me a message saying that someone just came over. It fits our requirements quite well.”Yang Jiao lied that a relative had gone missing and left her contact information at the aid station, if she ran into a beautiful woman in her mid-thirties who was delirious, she would immediately contact her. ”

Xi Weiyue nodded. “Okay.”

“Soon, a Mercedes-benz stopped at the entrance of the West Ring Road Aid Station. ”

“”Hello, you must be Ms. Yang, right?”A staff member jogged forward. ”

“I am.”Yang Jiao nodded.

“The staff member continued, “Ms. Yang, Hello, the person is right over here. Please follow me.” ”

“Okay.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Yang Jiao and Xi Weiyue followed the staff member’s footsteps.

There were vagrants from all over the world in the aid station. The place was noisy and the environment was not very good.

Many people looked curiously at the luxuriously dressed Yang Jiao and Xi Weiyue’s mother and daughter.

The way the two of them dressed was a stark contrast to the crude aid station.

“Yang Jiao was fine. After all, it was not her first time coming to a place like this. ”

Xi Weiyue was not used to it and her frown never eased.

“She had long been prepared for the aid station’s conditions, but she did not expect that the environment here was even worse than she had imagined. ”
