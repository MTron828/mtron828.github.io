Chapter 59: Background

That’s right. How would a person who couldn’t even recognize Chinese characters understand what it meant to know one’s limitations?

Qian Dabao continued, “After you’re done packing, go directly to the class teacher of Class 7.”

“Got it.” Ye Zhuo nodded.

When they arrived at the classroom, An Lizi asked curiously, “Zhuo Zhuo, why was Mediterranean looking for you?”

Ye Zhuo repeated Qian Dabao’s exact words.

Upon hearing this, An Lizi frowned and said, “How could Mediterranean do this to you? We’re already in the third year of high school, yet he wants you to change classes! He’s looking down on you too much!”

After saying this, An Lizi hugged Ye Zhuo’s arm.

“Zhuo Zhuo, I can’t bear to part with you! If you leave, who will whisper to me in class? Who will accompany me to the canteen? Who will accompany me to the toilet?”

Ye Zhuo smiled and comforted her, “Lizi, I’m just changing classes, it’s not like I’m changing schools. Moreover, I’m in the Class 7 next door. In the future, we can still go to the canteen and go to the toilet together!”

“That makes sense…” An Lizi helped Ye Zhuo pack up her things.

Suddenly, Ye Zhuo seemed to have recalled something. She took out an oilpaper package from her school bag, “Oh right, Lizi, this is your favorite fried rice ball. My mother made it herself. See if it tastes good.”

Ye Zhuo had specially brought this for An Lizi.

After all, An Lizi was the only good friend who treated the orginal owner of the body sincerely.

This was also the reason why she had asked Qian Dabao to give her another chance when the class teacher had asked her to transfer classes just now.

Unfortunately, Qian Dabao did not believe her.

“Thank you, Zhuo Zhuo.” An Lizi’s eyes lit up when she heard that there was food.

After Ye Zhuo packed her things, she followed the class teacher of Class 7, Jiang Wenhui, to her new class.

Although Class 7 was only separated by a wall from the ace class, compared to the ace class, Class Seven’s discipline was obviously much worse. As soon as they arrived at the door, they heard a burst of noise and laughter.

“F*ck! Nanny Rong is here!”

It was unknown who said this, but the originally noisy classroom instantly quieted down.

Everyone rushed to keep their lipstick away, close the mirror, and hide their phones.

Jiang Wenhui pushed open the classroom door walked to the podium, and slapper the ruler on it, “Oh my God! Our class is the quietest in the entire grade! Why are you all so obedient? Your grades are so good, and you’re so disciplined! Oh! You guys are so outstanding! You guys are simply the most outstanding class I’ve ever taught!”

Jiang Wenhui’s biggest characteristic was that she liked to say the opposite of the truth. For example, now, the students below the stage all knew Jiang Wenhui’s personality, and they were all as quiet as chickens.

Ye Zhuo stood outside the classroom with a faint smile.

This new class teacher was quite humorous.

Jiang Wenhui glanced at the students below the stage and continued, “There’s a new student who is transferred to our class today. Everyone, give her a round of applause!”

As soon as she said this, a round of enthusiastic applause immediately broke out below the stage.

There were even people who whistled.

Ye Zhuo walked in from outside with her backpack on her back.

Jiang Wenhui turned to look at Ye Zhuo. “Student Ye, please introduce yourself to everyone.”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and walked to the podium. “Hello, everyone. I’m Ye Zhuo. I hope that everyone will take good care of me this year.”

“What the f*ck! What a beauty!”

“Welcome, new student.”

“I heard that she’s Mu Zhuo from the ace class next door!”

“F*ck! That fake daughter of the Mu Family?”

“Alright! Quiet down for a moment!” Jiang Wenhui knocked the ruler on the podium and pointed to an empty seat. “New Classmate Ye, you can sit there.”

“Okay.”

Ye Zhuo carried her bag and walked over to her seat. Her deskmate was a slightly plump girl. Seeing Ye Zhuo come over, she quickly stood up and offered her a seat.

“Thank you.”

After sitting down, Ye Zhuo extended her hand to her new deskmate. “I am Ye Zhuo. From now on, we will be deskmates. Please take care of me.”

Her new deskmate looked at Ye Zhuo in surprise. Then, she quickly shook Ye Zhuo’s hand. Her voice was like a mosquito’s. “I… I am Zhao Pingting.”

Meanwhile, in Mountain River Manor, Beijing.

“Boss, the results of the test from Country T and Country L are out.” The assistant handed the two documents to Lin Jincheng.

Lin Jincheng took the documents and opened them with trembling hands.

When he saw the words on them, the light in his eyes quickly dimmed, and the test results in his hands fell to the ground.

At this moment, the sound of footsteps came from outside the door. Before he could pick up the documents, someone walked in from outside.

The person who entered was an old lady with grizzled hair. She picked up the test results that had fallen to the ground, “You actually sent someone abroad to do an appraisal! Did you think I would lie to you? Could it be that in your heart, your mother is that kind of person? If that Ye Yourong really is the flesh and blood of our Lin family, can I not acknowledge her?”

Madam Lin was about to be angered to death by Lin Jincheng.

Even now, Lin Jincheng still had fantasies about Ye Shu.

Back then, when Ye Shu and Lin Jincheng were dating, Madam Lin was 100% against it.

After all, the difference in status between the two was too great.

Later, when Ye Shu gave birth, Madam Lin did not know that Ye Shu had given birth to a pair of twins. She had carried away the first child.

It was not until seventeen years later that Madam Lin was surprised to learn that Ye Shu had given birth to twins.

But after Madam Lin saw the child, she felt that the child did not look like Lin Jincheng, much less her twin brother.

So, Madam Lin went to consult a doctor.

At that time, the doctor told her that fraternal twins could have different fathers and mothers.

In order to avoid any misunderstanding, Madam Lin specially had someone take a sample and go to the hospital to do a paternity test. The facts proved that her suspicions were not wrong.

The final result showed that the child called Ye Yourong really was not Lin Jincheng’s.

In other words, Ye Shu had been two-timing him back then.

She had betrayed Lin Jincheng.

When Lin Jincheng saw this result, his face was filled with disbelief.

As long as he could remember, Ye Shu was a very beautiful and kind-hearted good girl.

Thus, three months ago, he personally went to Yunjing and strategized a way to get that child’s hair. In order to avoid Madam Lin from doing something hanky-panky to the results in the country, he had specially done a paternity test in five different countries.

However, these five reports all showed that he had nothing to do with that child.

Madam Lin let out a long sigh. “Jincheng, listen to your mother’s advice. A fickle woman like Ye Shu is really not worth it. You love her so much and have given so much for her. In the end, what did you get in return? After so many years, you should start living for yourself!”

“Mom, don’t say anymore. I know what to do.” Lin Jincheng’s expression was indescribable.

Madam Lin continued, “Ah Ze needs a mother, and you need a wife. I think Qianhua is not bad. After all, she has been waiting for you for so many years.”

“Mom, I don’t harbor any indecent thoughts toward Qianhua. If you don’t want the same thing to happen again, please don’t say that again.”

Lin Jincheng turned around and walked out.

The way he walked was different from normal people. If one looked carefully, they would see that his right foot was a prosthetic leg.
