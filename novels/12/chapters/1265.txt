“Chapter 1266: 268: China, Ye Zhuo! 1”

Translator: 549690339

“In this world, only he and Zhao Xueyin were ye Sen’s real family! ”

They were a real family.

“No matter when or what happened, no one could change this fact. ”

Now that Zhao Xueyin was injured.

“As his older brother, Ye Sen would definitely not sit idly by. ”

Ye Zhuo’s medical skills were so good that she would definitely be able to heal Zhao Xueyin’s face.

“After ye Zhuo healed Zhao Xueyin’s face, he could ask ye Zhuo to give a portion of Shunxi Financial Group’s shares to the Zhao family. ”

“After all, Ye Sen was ye Zhuo’s uncle. ”

Wouldn’t it be natural for a niece to give her shares to her uncle?

Ye Sen was his son.

“If ye Zhuo gave his shares to Ye Sen, it would be the same as giving his shares to the Zhao family. ”

“At that time, the Shunxi Financial Group would still belong to the Zhao family. ”

“The more father Zhao thought about it, the more excited he became, and his heart beat faster and faster, he continued, “Son, you haven’t met your sister, right? If your sister sees you as her brother, she will definitely be very happy! It’s been more than 30 years, more than 30 years! The two of you are finally going to meet!” ”

“Ye Sen was a little confused when he heard this, and he continued, “You must be mistaken! My Name Is Ye Sen, not Zhao Ziye!” ”

Ye Sen had a very bad impression of Father Zhao.

He did not wish for Father Zhao to be his biological father!

“Father Zhao hugged ye Sen, he cried bitterly, “Son! Son! I am really your father! Father has been looking for you for so many years. Father knows that you resent father, but father did not mean to lose you. Father, I beg you, Father has kowtowed to you! Can you forgive Father?” ”

Father Zhao knelt down in front of ye Sen.

“As long as he could recognize his son, kneeling down was nothing? ”

“Although ye Sen didn’t like Father Zhao, he still felt bad when he saw the white-haired old man kneeling in front of him. He quickly said, “Why are you kneeling down? Get Up!” ”

“Father Zhao continued, “If you don’t forgive me, then I won’t Get Up!” ”

The current Ye Sen wasn’t just a son to Father Zhao.

He was also the only savior of the Zhao family.

Weren’t those people in the financial world taking advantage of others?

He wanted to show them.

“Even if they were kicked out of the financial world, they could still return with their heads held high! ”

“Not only could they return with their heads held high, but after they returned to the financial world, their status would be even more eye-catching than before. ”

“Looking at Father Zhao kneeling on the ground, Ye Sen was in a difficult position. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen walked over and said, “I say, how can you be so thick-skinned! Didn’t you hear Xiao Ye say that he doesn’t know you? You’re already so old, yet you’re still using this trick. Aren’t you afraid that others will laugh at you?” ”

“Father Zhao raised his head to look at Old Mrs. Cen, he was very moved and said, “Old Man, you’re also a parent. You should know the pain of separation of flesh and blood... “My son and I have been separated for more than 30 years. Now, I have finally found him. As long as he can forgive me, I will not hesitate to give him my life even if he wants it, let alone kneel to him!” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen rolled her eyes and said speechlessly, “He is not a murderer. Why would he want your life? Can’t you see that? A child doesn’t want to acknowledge you at all. Is it meaningful for you to be like this?” ”

“Then I’ll kneel until he acknowledges me!”

“”You’re playing the moral kidnapping game, right?”Old Mrs. Cen pointed at father Zhao and said, “I hate people like you the most in my life! Your skin is thicker than the corner of the city wall!” ”

To say that Father Zhao was as strong as a bald man was an insult to the character of a bald man.

It was simply too disgusting!

“At this moment, there was a knock on the door. ”

“Who is it?”

Ye Shu walked over to open the door.

“The moment she opened the door, she saw Lin Jincheng standing outside with three policemen. ”

“Lin Jincheng said, “Ah Shu, let me introduce you. This is captain Li. This is Officer Zhou, and this is Officer Yin.” ”

“After saying that, Lin Jincheng turned to look at the three policemen. “Captain Li, Officer Zhou, and Officer Yin. This is my wife, Ye Shu.” ”

“Captain Li reached out his hand to ye Shu. “Hello, Ms. Ye. I’m Li Yuan, the person in charge of this case.” ”

“Ye Shu reached out and held captain Li’s hand. “Captain Li, I’ll have to trouble you with my brother’s matter.” ”

“Of course.”

“”Come in, please.”Ye Shu made a welcoming gesture. ”

The three police officers walked in.

“Father Zhao, who was kneeling on the ground, was stunned when he saw the police officers who came in. ”

He had a guilty conscience.

He didn’t forget that he was the mastermind.

He had hired someone to kill someone.

And it was his own son who had been killed.

“If Yesen knew about this, he would never forgive him! ”
