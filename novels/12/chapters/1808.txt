The couple turned around and walked downstairs.

Ye Zao also went to the bathroom to wash up.

“Looking at himself in the mirror in front of the sink, ye Zao narrowed his eyes. ”

That name appeared in his mind again.

Ye Han.

Who exactly was ye Han?

Why did she have that strange dream?

Was the little boy in the dream her actual memory?

“If so, why did she lose her memory? ”

“As she thought about it, ye Zao suddenly felt a sharp pain in his temple. ”

“It was as if he had exploded, and his face slowly turned pale. ”

“Ye Zao slightly bent down, turned on the tap, poured water on his face, and washed his face with cold water. ”

“The cold water rolled off his face. Ye Zao picked up a towel at the side and slowly wiped his face. Then, he took out his toothbrush and brushed his teeth. ”

“Twenty minutes later, ye Zao came to the dining room. ”

Ye Shu and Lin Jincheng were already sitting at the dining table waiting for ye Zao to eat.

“Zao Zao is here. Come and eat.”Ye Shu turned around and looked at ye Zao. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Ye Zao walked over with a smile. “Where’s My Brother?”

“”Your brother went out with his high school classmate,”ye Shu said. ”

“OH.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Lin Jincheng picked up the bowl. “Zao Zao, let me serve you a bowl of sugar water porridge first.” ”

“This sugar water porridge was made with lotus seeds, bird’s nest, handmade rock candy, and snow clams. It was sweet but not greasy. It also had the effect of beautifying one’s appearance and was also ye Zao’s favorite. ”

“”Thank you, Dad.”Ye Zao stood up and took the bowl from Lin Jincheng with both hands. ”

“After the family of three finished breakfast, ye Langhua came. ”

“Shu! Are You At Home?”

“”Mom, I’m at Home!”Ye Shu went out. “Have you eaten?” ”

“I’ve eaten.”Ye Langhua put the things in his hands on the table. “I brought some wild eels and old turtles for you.”

“Hearing this, Ye Shu said in surprise, “Where did you get them?”Now, it was really difficult to buy pure wild old turtles and eels! ”

“”I asked Xiao Ge’s parents to buy it in the countryside.”Xiao Ge was an employee of ye Langhua’s shop. He was honest and honest. He had just been promoted to store manager a few days ago, so his parents came to visit him and play in the capital. ”

“”OH.”Ye Shu nodded and said with a smile, “Then I’ll have the kitchen burn it down tonight. You can stay here for a few days before you go back.” ”

“”No, no.”Ye langhua refused repeatedly, “I have to go to B city in the afternoon.” ”

“”What are you going to B city for?”The distance between Beijing and B city was more than a thousand kilometers, and it took more than three hours by plane. ”

“”I’m going to visit an old friend,”ye Langhua said. ”

“Then I’ll go with you.”Ye Langhua was old. Ye Shu was a little worried about her going alone.

“If something happened, it would be too late to regret! ”

“Ye langhua smiled and said, “No need. I’m just going to see an old friend. Besides, I’m not too old to walk. I don’t need you to accompany me.” ”

“I’m not busy recently. I’ll accompany you for a walk. I’ll treat it as accompanying you on a trip!”Ye Shu said.

“”That works too.”Ye Langhua continued, “If you’re going, then we’ll leave Tomorrow Morning.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Shu nodded.

“Ye Langhua sat down on the sofa and continued, “Aren’t the two children at Home?” ”

“Ye Shu said, “Ah Ze went out with his classmate. Burning just left the house!” ”

“OH.”Ye Langhua nodded.

On the other side.

Beijing University.

“After Ouyang Nai’s month-long strategy, she finally managed to woo Li Yueyue. ”

“At this time, the two of them were sitting in the coffee shop on a date. ”

“Li Yueyue was a very clear-headed person. During their relationship, she would never spend a single cent of her boyfriend’s money. For example, Ouyang Nai would treat her to coffee today, and she would treat Ouyang Nai to dinner tomorrow. ”

“Ouyang Nai gave her a bouquet of flowers, and Li Yueyue gave him a game skin. ”

“”Yueyue, it’s going to be a holiday soon. Are you staying in Beijing for the New Year or going back to your hometown?”Ouyang Nai asked. ”

“Of course I’m going back home!”Li Yueyue said.

Ouyang Nai nodded. “Have you bought the plane ticket?”

“”No.”Li Yueyue shook her head and continued, “I’m going back by train.” ”

By Train?

Ouyang Nai looked at her in surprise.

“Li Yueyue’s home was in the prairie, 3,000 kilometers away from the capital. It would take three days and three nights by train! ”

Didn’t they say that Li Yueyue was a rich second generation?

Why would she take the train?

Or did Li Yueyue want to experience life?

“Ouyang Nai swallowed his throat and continued, “By the way, Yueyue, are uncle and aunt busy recently?” ”

“”It’s snowing over there now, so we’re not very busy. The real busy times are spring and summer,”Li Yueyue replied. ”
