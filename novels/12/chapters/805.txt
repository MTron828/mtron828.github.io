“If Old Lady Lin could stand up at this moment, she would have already stood up and strangled Feng Xianxian. ”

Unfortunately.

She couldn’t stand up at all now.

This was all caused by Feng Xianxian!

“Faced with this sudden scene, the reporters seemed to have dug up some big secret of the day. One after another, they handed microphones to Feng Xianxian. Countless cameras aimed at Feng Xianxian’s face and slapped it frantically. ”

Feng Xianxian was like a deflated rubber ball. She collapsed on the ground like dead wood and ashes.

She never dreamed that things would suddenly turn out like this.

She originally thought that she could smoothly take away everything that belonged to her.

What should she do?

What should she do now?

Who could help her?

“Under the current situation, no one could help her. ”

She could only think of a way to save herself.

No matter what.

She could not let anything happen to her.

“”No, it’s not like that. Grandmother, I was also framed...”Feng Xianxian cried as she crawled in front of Old Lady Lin. ”

Old Lady Lin was an idiot.

“As long as she said a few soft words, Old Lady Lin would definitely forgive her! ”

Right.

She would definitely forgive her.

“Thinking of this, Feng Xianxian’s eyes lit up as she cried, “Grandmother, please forgive me just this once. Just this once, I will be your slave to repay you! I really know my mistake! Grandmother, i Beg You...” ”

“Unfortunately, this time, Old Lady Lin did not relent. She turned to look at Lin Jincheng. “Jincheng, call the police!” ”

Lin Jincheng nodded and arranged for someone to call the police.

“”No! Grandma! You Can’t call the Police!”Feng Xianxian hugged Old Lady Lin’s hand. “I know my mistake! Please forgive me one more time, okay? This is the last time!” ”

Old Lady Lin pushed Feng Xianxian away.

“Feng Xianxian was thrown to the ground, her face full of tears. ”

No.

She couldn’t.

She couldn’t go to jail.

“Feng Qianhua was already in jail. If she was arrested again, they would be finished. ”

“”Grandma, I’m begging you. Since you’ve watched me grow up, please forgive me just this once, okay? As long as you can forgive me, I’m willing to pay any price! As long as you give me a chance, I’ll definitely turn over a new leaf and be filial to you... ... ...” ”

“Old Lady Lin looked at Feng Qianxian coldly. No matter how badly Feng Qianxian kowtowed, she did not frown. ”

Feng Qianxian knew that she could not continue kowtowing like this.

She had to think of a way.

“Feng Qianxian narrowed her eyes and looked up at Old Lady Lin. “Grandma, I owe you my life. Then today, I’ll return this life to you!” ”

“As soon as she finished speaking, Feng Xianxian rushed toward the wall at the side. ”

Bang!

A bloody mark appeared on the snow-white Wall.

Feng Xianxian also fainted on the ground.

“At the same time, the police came in one after another. ”

“Who called the police?”

“”Officer, I called the police.”Lin Jincheng walked in front of the police. ”

“When Feng Xianxian woke up again, she saw nothing but white. ”

Was this the hospital?

“Looking up, she saw an old lady with white hair sitting by the bed. ”

Old Lady Lin!

“When Feng Xianxian saw Old Lady Lin, a hint of pride flashed across her eyes. ”

She knew that Old Lady Lin would definitely forgive her.

“After all, after Feng Qianhua’s poisoning of Old Lady Lin was exposed last time, she had only cut her wrist and Old Lady Lin had already forgiven her. ”

Idiot!

“Feng Xianxian curled her lips and hid her smug look in her eyes. She said weakly, “Grandma...” ”

“You’re Awake?”Old Lady Lin sat in her wheelchair and looked at Feng Xianxian.

“Feng Xianxian nodded. “Grandma, I’m sorry... I was wrong in the past. I didn’t expect you to forgive me...” ”

“”It’s good that you’re awake.”Old Mrs. Lin turned her wheelchair and looked outside the door. “Officer Yin, Officer Ma, Feng Xianxian is awake.” ”

Feng Xianxian realized that one of her hands was handcuffed to the bed.

What was going on?

Could it be that old Mrs. Lin didn’t forgive her?

“Grandma?”Feng Xianxian looked at Old Mrs. Lin in disbelief. The cold sweat on her face almost appeared all of a sudden.

“”Grandma?”Old Lady Lin sneered. “You still dare to call me grandma when death is at hand! Feng Xianxian, do you really think that I will be deceived by you again and again?” ”

“Feng Xianxian swallowed her throat and wanted to get up and run out of the door, but one of her hands was handcuffed, so she couldn’t run at all. ”

What should she do?

What should she do now?

Feng Xianxian was flustered.

“Just then, two policemen came in through the door. ”

Feng Xianxian was taken to the temporary interrogation room.
