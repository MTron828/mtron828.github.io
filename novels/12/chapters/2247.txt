Translator: 549690339

“Bai Jingshu did not want to agree to Chen Yaosheng in a hurry, but she was afraid that she would regret it if she missed him. ”

She felt that she needed time to think about it.

“Chen Yaosheng nodded. “Alright, Jingshu, you must not give yourself any pressure. You can think about it for as long as you want. No matter what, I will stand behind you.” ”

Chen Yaosheng was quite excited now.

“Since Bai Jingshu actually mentioned that she wanted to think about it, it meant that this matter was not far off. ”

One had to know that the Bai Jingshu in the past did not even want to look at it.

“Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded. “Get up first.”

Chen Yaosheng stood up from the ground and handed her the flowers. “Take the flowers first.”

Bai Jingshu hesitated for a moment.

Was it not good for her to take the flowers before she had promised Chen Yaosheng?

“Chen yaosheng smiled and said, “Jingshu, don’t worry. The thing that I dislike the most is pestering. I Won’t feel embarrassed to reject me after considering it just because you took my flowers. “This bouquet can also be a flower of friendship.” ”

“Thank you.”Bai Jingshu took the flowers with both hands. “The flowers are very beautiful.”

The flowers were indeed very beautiful. They were very artistic lilacs.

“They were not as enchanting as roses, nor were they as bright as platycodon flowers. ”

Bai Jingshu really liked them very much.

“”It’s good that you like them,”Chen Yaosheng said. ”

Bai Jingshu lowered her head and sniffed the fragrance of the flowers. It was the smell that she liked.

“Chen yaosheng continued, “Although I didn’t succeed in confessing my love today, I still have to eat. Shall we go and have a meal?” ”

“Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded and followed Chen Yaosheng’s footsteps.

The two of them arrived at an elegant hotel.

“Actually, Chen Yaosheng did not like this kind of food from Earth at all. However, since Bai Jingshu liked it, he could only pretend to like it. ”

He endured it.

He endured until he had Bai Jingshu firmly wrapped around him.

Bai Jingshu held the plate of dishes and looked up at Chen Yaosheng. “What do you like to eat?”

“”I’m a very easy person to feed. I’m not picky about food. I’ll eat whatever you order,”Chen Yaosheng said. ”

“How can that be?”Bai Jingshu smiled and handed the tablet to Chen Yaosheng. “Take a look at the menu.”

“”There’s really no need,”Chen Yaosheng said. ”

“Bai Jingshu continued, “I’ve already said that we’re friends. Why are you being so polite with your friends, Mr. Chen?” ”

“Chen yaosheng smiled and said, “Since that’s the case, I’ll accept your request.” ”

“After saying that, he took the tablet with both hands. ”

“Because he had done his homework beforehand, Chen Yaosheng was very clear about Bai Jingshu’s taste. He ordered two dishes and returned the tablet to Bai Jingshu. “I’ve ordered it. You can do it.” ”

Bai Jingshu took the tablet and was a little surprised.

Because the two dishes that Chen Yaosheng ordered were both her favorite dishes.

She didn’t expect that their interests were the same. Even their tastes were the same now.

“Perhaps, it was really fate. ”

The corners of Bai Jingshu’s mouth curved slightly.

Chen Yaosheng saw all of this.

It was not far from what he wanted to see.

Bai Jingshu added three more dishes and then returned the tablet to Chen Yaosheng. “How about this?”

“Chen Yaosheng took the tablet and said in surprise, “I actually like the dishes you ordered!” ”

“Really?”Bai Jingshu asked.

“Yes.”Chen Yaosheng nodded. “It’s been a long time since I’ve met someone with the same taste. You should know how difficult it is to find someone with the same taste in the S Galaxy.”

“Speaking up to this point, Chen yaosheng said in puzzlement, “I really don’t know why they like nutrient fluids so much.” ”

“Bai Jingshu smiled. “Perhaps everyone has a different ability to accept things. In fact, the two dishes you ordered were also dishes that I often ordered.” ”

“What a coincidence?”Chen Yaosheng’s face was full of disbelief.

“Yeah.”Bai Jingshu nodded. “I also think it’s quite a coincidence.”

The world was so big. It was really not easy to meet a person who shared the same interests.

“Chen Yaosheng was a person who was especially good at finding topics to talk about. Especially after he understood Bai Jingshu in all aspects, he almost never got cold feet. ”

“Bai Jingshu was originally a person who did not talk much. However, under the influence of Chen Yaosheng, she gradually became more talkative. ”

The meal was very enjoyable.

“Before he left, Chen Yaosheng looked at Bai Jingshu and continued, “Jingshu, you look very good when you smile. You can smile more in the future.” ”

“Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Chen Yaosheng walked Bai Jingshu to her door.

Bai Jingshu took the initiative to invite him. “Do you want to go in and have a cup of tea?”

“”No.”Chen Yaosheng shook his head and said, “I have something to do when I go back today.” ”
