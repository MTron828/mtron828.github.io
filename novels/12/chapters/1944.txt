Changyue country.

“Planet E-TY889, located outside the Milky Way. ”

It was several million light years away from Earth.

“Through this hypnosis, Ye Zhuo recalled many things. ”

“”Changyue Country?”Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly. subconsciously, he felt that this name was somewhat familiar. He continued, “Is it planet E-TY889?” ”

“”Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and said with some surprise, “You also know planet E-TY889?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “A little. When we were in space, we used the Halley Telescope to observe Planet E-TY889.”However, because planet E-TY889 was too far away from Earth.., therefore, Cen Shaoqing knew very little about that place. ”

He didn’t expect Ye Zhuo to come from planet E-TY889.

“After a while, Cen Shaoqing turned to look at Ye Zhuo and opened his thin lips. “So, you’re an Alien?” ”

“”Not really.”Ye Zhuo shook his head slightly, “Even though Chang Yue is on planet E-TY889, their ancestors were born and raised on Earth. Their space civilization reached level 3 several thousand years ago. Later, the leader suggested moving to another planet, but the humans on earth were overloaded, so there was a survival of the fittest.” ”

“However, the humans who went to Planet E-TY889 didn’t expect that the human civilization on Earth would develop so quickly. ”

“That year, after the group of humans boarded the spaceship, they destroyed all the advanced inventions left on Earth. ”

They restored Earth to the appearance of the dinosaurs.

That was why there were later cavemen who drilled wood to make fire...

Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly. “Do you remember anything else?”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “The other rooms are not much different from my memories. The only difference is that I have a younger brother, his name is Ye Han. “However, ever since my accident, Ye Han has disappeared. I wonder how ye Han is now!” ” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“”Oh right, there’s also a battle armor elf named Yi Ling,”Ye Zao continued. ”

“It was fine if he couldn’t remember it before, but now that he remembered it, ye Zao couldn’t wait to go back and take a look. ”

“Cen Shaoqing turned to look out of the window and continued, “Zao Zao, do you want to go back and take a look?” ”

“”Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly and continued, “However, Planet E-TY889 is too far away from Earth.” ”

“Although she had the most advanced technology, the energy on Earth was limited. She could not find a way to go back in such a short time. ”

Cen Shaoqing narrowed his phoenix-like eyes. The depths of his deep eyes were pitch black. No one could see clearly what he was thinking.

...

The next day.

“Early in the morning, he ziteng drove over to pick up Xu Yao. ”

“Unlike last night, Xu Yao was already familiar with her appearance and was waiting for him at the entrance of the villa. ”

“He ziteng smiled and said, “Why? Aren’t you going to test me today?” ”

“Xu Yao said, “I originally wanted to test you, but I decided to let you off at the last minute.” ”

“Then should I thank you?”He ziteng turned to look at Xu Yao.

“Xu Yao fastened her seatbelt and continued, “There’s no need for that. After all, I didn’t test you because of uncle and Auntie! If you want to thank me, go thank uncle and Auntie!” ”

This sentence was also an indirect expression. She was not the kind of girl who did not know her place.

“Although she was ‘acting’, she had her own set of circumstances. ”

“It was fine for a couple to watch a movie together, but seeing their parents was a big deal, they could not act anymore. ”

He ziteng felt that Xu Yao was more sensible.

“If it were other girls, they would definitely not be half as sensible as Xu Yao. ”

“Xu Yao continued, “Oh right, I brought some snacks that I personally made for uncle and Auntie. I don’t know if they will like it.” ”

A big family like the He family did not like any nutritional or luxury items at all.

What they valued was the sincerity.

“Gifts were light, but affection was heavy. ”

“Hence, Xu Yao prepared the handmade snacks. ”

“Although she did not personally make them, the chefs at home did. ”

They were all handmade pastries. What else could the he family’s parents possibly know?

He ziteng smiled and nodded. “They like it. They’ll definitely like it very much.”

“Xu Yao said, “Really?” ”

“”Yes, of course it’s true.”He ziteng nodded. ”

“For a kind-hearted girl like Xu Yao, unless the he family’s parents were blind, they wouldn’t like her. ”

On the other side.

The He family.

The He family’s parents were also quite nervous.

“He ziteng had had a girlfriend before, but this was the first time he had brought one back. ”

“From this, it could be seen that he ziteng was serious this time. ”

Especially father he. He buttoned his shirt again and again and turned to look at mother he. “Do you think I can do this?”

“”Sure, no problem.”Mother he was a little speechless. “It’s your son who brought his girlfriend back, not you. What are you nervous about?” ”

“Father he said, “I’m not nervous. I’m not nervous at all. What’s there to be nervous about?” ”

Mother he saw through it and did not say anything.

“At that moment, the sound of a car engine came from outside the door. ”

Father he immediately reacted. “They’re here! They’re here! Ziteng and the others are back!”

“Hearing that, mother he was also a little nervous. She looked at father he and said, “Do you think I’m so appropriate today?” ”

“”Proper, very proper!”Father he nodded and said with a smile, “Didn’t you just say that you weren’t nervous?” ”

Mother he rolled her eyes at him. “How am I Nervous?”

“At this moment, the sound of footsteps gradually approached. ”

“Mother he continued, “Let’s go out and take a look.” ”

Father he nodded and followed mother he’s footsteps.

The two of them came to the door.

They saw he ziteng walking in with a young girl.

“The girl was about twenty-one or twenty-two years old. She was wearing a white one-piece dress, a black down jacket, and a pair of beige knee-high boots. ”

She looked young and beautiful.

“But for some reason, when mother he saw her for the first time, she subconsciously resisted. She didn’t like it and frowned slightly. ”

“Although she was a little unhappy, mother he didn’t show it. She smiled and greeted, “You’re back!” ”

“”Yes.”He ziteng nodded and continued, “Father and mother, let me introduce you. This is my girlfriend, Xu Yao. Yaoyao, this is my parents.” ”

“Xu Yao said very politely, “Hello, uncle and Auntie. I’m Xu Yao. You Can Call Me Yaoyao.” ”

“Father he was about to speak when mother xu interrupted him, “Hello, Miss Xu.” ”

Miss Xu?

“When she heard this, Xu Yao’s expression froze for a moment before disappearing. ”

Mother he was resisting her?

Didn’t like her?

Why?

She didn’t do anything that mother Xu disliked...

“Father he patted mother Xu’s arm without leaving a trace. “Ziteng, quickly bring Miss Xu in.” ”

“Quickly come in.”

The few of them walked into the house.

“Xu Yao took out a beautifully wrapped handmade snack and continued, “Uncle and aunt, the first thing I did was to come over. I don’t know what you two like to eat. This is a pastry that I personally made. Please try it and see if it suits your appetite.” ”

“Father he said in surprise, “Miss Xu, you can also make pastries?” ”

Xu Yao nodded. “I’m just making them for fun. As long as uncle doesn’t mind.”

“”Don’t mind, don’t mind.”Father he picked up two pastries and handed one to mother he. “Xunfang, have a taste too.” ”

“Mother he smiled and said, “My teeth have been hurting recently, so I can’t eat anything too sweet.” ”

“He ziteng frowned slightly. He knew that his mother was deliberately making things difficult for Xu Yao, so he continued, “Mom, I remember that you don’t have a toothache problem.” ”

Mother he glanced at he ziteng. “Aren’t all kinds of problems when you’re Old?”

“Xu Yao smiled and said, “Auntie, you’re not old at all. You look much younger than my mother.” ”

Mother he smiled and did not reply.

She had only disliked Xu Yao a little.

“After these few sentences, she looked down on Xu Yao even more. ”

Because Xu Yao’s words were full of deliberate flattery.

Other than deliberate.

Xu Yao was also a little hypocritical.

“This pastry was obviously made by the pastry chef, but she insisted that it was made by herself. ”

Did she really think that she couldn’t see through it?

Only He ziteng was foolishly deceived by her.

“Mother he was born into a wealthy family. In all these years, she had seen all kinds of people who had traveled far and wide? ”

She could tell at a glance who Xu Yao was.

“This was only the first time they had met. If Xu Yao lied to them like this, what would happen if she really married into the He family in the future? ”

He ziteng felt that his mother had gone too far.

“Xu Yao was such a good girl, but his mother had actually made things difficult for her. ”

“If it were anyone else, they would have been angry long ago. However, not only was Xu Yao not angry, she was smiling at him instead. ”

“Father he tasted a piece of pastry and continued, “This taste is really not bad. It’s even better than the ones I bought. Miss Xu, you’re really amazing!” ”

“”Uncle, I’m sorry. If you like it, I’ll often make it for you in the future. It’s a pity that Auntie can’t eat anything too sweet.”After saying that, Xu Yao looked at mother he, then she said, “Auntie, if there’s a chance next time, I’ll make it sugar-free for you.” ”

“Mother he smiled slightly and looked up at Xu Yao. She said unhurriedly, “It’s better to choose today. Why don’t we do it today? I Can’t wait to try Miss Xu’s cooking.” ”
