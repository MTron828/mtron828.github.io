“At this moment, Zhao Dan could not hear or see anything. ”

His mind was blank.

His eyes were a little hot.

“When the assistant saw this, he immediately walked forward. “Are you not feeling well?” ”

“The assistant’s voice pulled Zhao Dan’s thoughts back to reality. Zhao Dan grabbed the assistant’s hand and steadied himself. “No, it’s fine.” ”

“After saying that, Zhao Dan looked at ye Zhuo and continued, “Miss Ye, I’m sorry. I lost my composure.” ”

“”Madam, you’re too kind.”Ye Zhuo’s tone was slow as he continued, “I saw that you didn’t look too good. Are you not used to the Environment?” ”

“”Yes.”Zhao Dan nodded. “Miss Ye, Congratulations on your return from the fire. I, I’ll go back first.” ”

“Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Alright, be careful.” ”

Zhao Dan tightly held his assistant’s hand and walked down the stage in a hurry.

“Ye Zhuo frowned slightly. She felt that Zhao Dan was a little strange. However, she did not think too much about it. She walked to Ye Han’s side and fed him a pill. ”

It was a black pill. It was very small and melted in the mouth.

“Ye Han had just eaten the pill when he frowned slightly. Then, he opened his eyes. ”

“The moment he opened his eyes, he saw ye Zhuo standing in front of him. ”

“Ye Han.”

Ye Han’s eyes reddened instantly. He hugged ye Zhuo excitedly. “Sister!”

“Ye Zhuo’s brows were filled with a smile as he patted ye Han’s back. “A man should be a man, why are you crying!” ”

“”Sister, you’re really back! Sister!”Hearing Ye Zhuo’s voice, Ye Han cried even more sorrowfully. ”

He thought that ye Zao would never come back.

“I came back late.”

“”No, SIS, I’m Sorry!”Ye Han blamed himself very much now. He had always said that he would protect ye Zao Well, but at the most critical moment, he was controlled by someone and almost fell into an abyss... ”

“If he was strong enough, things would never have turned out like this! ”

“”Ye Han, this is not your fault,”ye Zao’s tone was clear and shallow. “I know that you’ve done your best.” ”

“Sister!”

“”Ye Xiaohan, why are you crying? You’re such a Big Boy, aren’t you afraid of shame!”Yi Ling flew over from not far away. ”

“Hearing Yi Ling’s voice, ye Han immediately looked up. “Yi Ling! You’re okay!” ”

“Yi Ling landed on Ye Han’s head. “How could a handsome and handsome person like me be okay! Besides, I haven’t even ridden on your head to take a shit yet!” ”

“Ye Han hugged the clothes spirit and tossed it into the air. Then, he reached out to catch it and repeated it several times. ”

“Hahahaha...”

The air was filled with the laughter of the clothes spirit and Ye Han.

“The head patriarch, the eight clan leaders, and the other seven clan leaders walked up to Ye Zhuo. ”

“”Miss Ye, i...”The head patriarch looked at Ye Zhuo and didn’t know what to say. His face was full of shame. He never thought that a traitor would appear in the eight great clans, and even more so, that this traitor was the sixth clan leader... ! ... they, they almost caused ye Zhuo’s death! ”

“”Miss Ye, don’t worry. We will immediately remove the Guang clan from the eight great clans. From now on, there will be no Guang clan in Changyue Kingdom!” ”

“No need.”Ye Zhuo’s red lips opened slightly.

No need?

The head of the clan was stunned. He didn’t quite understand what ye Zhuo meant.

Could it be that the sixth clan head had betrayed ye Zhuo and ye Zhuo still had to forgive him?

“”Miss Ye, you?” ”

“Ye Zao smiled but did not say anything. He turned to look at the other side. “Guangxing, come over here for a moment.” ”

“Grandma!”Guangxing ran over with a smile.

Grandma?

The head of the clan could not understand this scene even more!

When did ye Zao become Guangxing’s Grandma?

“Ye Zao continued, “Head of the clan, from now on, Guangxing will take over the Guang family. The clan leaders are all the elders of Guangxing. If there is anything that the children have done badly, I hope that you can help them and forgive them.” ”

“After saying that, Ye Zhuo looked down at guangxing. “Hurry up and greet your uncles.” ”

“Guangxing faced everyone and said politely, “Uncle Shangguan, Uncle Zeng, Uncle Lin, Uncle Zhao, uncle Wu, Uncle Zhou, Uncle Ma, Hello, I Am Guangxing!” ”

“Thinking about Guangxing’s experience, the great clan leader felt a little sad. He nodded and said, “Good child, you have suffered!” ”

“”I’m fine, Uncle Shangguan.”Guangxing continued, “It’s all in the past.” ”

The head chief nodded and said a few more words to guangxing.

“The second chief stepped forward, “Miss Ye, can we have a word?” ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

The second chief followed ye Zhuo’s footsteps. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“The two walked to the side and the second chief continued, “Miss Ye, are you really going to let Guangxing take over the Guang Family?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“The second clan leader pointed at his own head, “But, but isn’t there a problem here? Have you really decided?” ”
