“Ready.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

Hibbert nodded as well.

“The host continued, “Then I declare that the competition has officially begun!” ”

There was a flurry of discussion below the stage.

“Oh my God! Is this Chinese woman crazy?”

“Is there still a need to compete in this round?”

Carl took his chips and went to bet.

“Seeing Carl Bet all his chips on ye Zhuo, some enthusiastic onlookers could not help but advise him, “Brother, Hibbert even won against Mandel. Do you think he will lose to a Chinese woman of unknown origin?” ”

“I believe that An will not lose!”Carl said.

“That Chinese woman is called An?”

Carl nodded.

“On the competition stage, the blonde woman in the rabbit costume had already started to deal cards. ”

Ye Zao looked at the cards in his hand and chose to call.

Hibbert also called.

“In the end, the chips on the table increased. ”

“The host was extremely excited. “Next, please open your cards one by one! Oh My God! Hibbert’s is a flush!” ”

A flush!

“In a poker game like Soha, a flush meant the cards in the same color and order. ”

“Among the five cards, the probability of getting this card at the same time was extremely low. ”

No Wonder Hibbert would choose to bet five times.

Carl broke out in cold sweat when he saw Hibbert’s straight flush.

It’s over!

It’s over!

“This time, Ye Zao was going to lose everything. ”

He should have stopped ye Zao just now.

What should he do now?

Carl was about to cry.

“At this moment, the sound of a cold breath suddenly appeared in the air. ”

Carl looked up and saw ye Zao’s cards on the big screen above his head.

“10, J, q, K, a! ”

It was even bigger than Hibbert’s flush.

It was a royal flush!

“The host was so excited that he could not speak. After a long while, he said, “Oh my God! This Miss Hua Guo An’s cards are a royal flush! Congratulations to Miss Hua Guo An!” ”

“Ah!”Carl from the audience was so excited that he almost jumped up.

He was really too excited.

“Compared to the other people at the side, he was not as excited. ”

Who would have thought that a Chinese girl of unknown origin would actually win against Hibbert.

One had to know that they had all placed their bets on Hibbert just now.

Ye Zhuo stood up from his chair and looked at Hibbert. “Thank you for letting me win.”

Hibbert did not have any expression on his face.

He had lost.

“After defeating Mandel, he had actually lost to a little girl! ”

...

“After defeating Hibbert, ye Zao did not stay in the casino for long. He changed the chips into money and gave Carl a third of it before leaving the casino. ”

“Carl looked at Ye Zao. “An, when are you going back to China?” ”

“Ye Zao said, “In about three days.” ”

“Then are we still coming tomorrow?”Carl continued to ask.

Ye Zao took out his earphones and put them on his ears. “Why? Haven’t you won enough today?”

Carl smiled embarrassedly.

“Ye Zao continued, “Go back first. If there’s anything else, I’ll contact you.” ”

“Okay.”Carl nodded.

“Ye Zao turned around and went to the bathroom. When she came out again, the white hoodie she was wearing had turned into a black windbreaker. It was a completely different outfit from before. ”

On the other side.

The spectator area on the third floor of Ranito Casino.

“Hibbert dragged his heavy steps to the front of the rostrum. He bent down and said, “Minister, I lost.” ”

“Minister Yaler sat at the head of the table with a cigar between his fingers. After a long while, he slowly said, “Did you see how she attacked?” ”

“In this world, there was no real king of gamblers. It was like there was no real magic in the world, but it was all about the speed of the fight. ”

Even Hibbert was the same.

He won against Mandel by cheating.

But he didn’t expect that he would lose to a little girl...

Hibbert shook his head. “I didn’t see it clearly.”

Minister Yalel frowned and turned to his assistant. “Go and bring the casino’s recording over.”

“Originally, the casino wanted to replace Mandel and let Hibbert firmly occupy the throne of the gambling king. ”

“However, all of these plans were disrupted by ye Zao! ”

“Not only was the plan disrupted, but a huge sum of money was also taken away! ”

Yalel could not swallow this resentment.

He wanted to see who sent this little girl.

“Under normal circumstances, he could deduce where she came from based on the method used. ”

Someone like her would definitely not be handed over by some nobody. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Okay.”

“Soon, the assistant brought the video over. ”

The large screen played the scene from earlier.

The entire process did not take more than fifteen minutes.

“She sat opposite the gambling table with her back straight. She was wearing sunglasses and a hat, so it was difficult to see her face clearly. ”
