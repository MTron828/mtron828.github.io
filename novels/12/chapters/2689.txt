“”How do you know that Ye Shu doesn’t Dare?”Zhou ziyue continued, “When you bought the villa, you were even more confident than you are now. What happened in the end?” ”

“Forget about the villa, even if she didn’t give ye Sui a pigeon cage, she would still buy it for ye Sui! ”

“Don’t worry! The villa won’t run away!”Ye Sui narrowed his eyes.

“Hearing this, Zhou Ziyue laughed out loud. “At this time, don’t tell me you still think that ye Shu will buy a villa for you?” ”

“She must buy it!”Ye Sui said.

Zhou Ziyue shook her head speechlessly. “Stop Dreaming.”

Ye Sui did not think that she was dreaming.

“Just wait and see!”Ye Sui said.

“Zhou Ziyue did not respond to this. She only said, “Fortunately, I did not tell Feng Yang What I said. Otherwise, I would have really become a clown!”She originally thought that Bai Jingshu had introduced him to a rich bachelor, but she did not expect him to be a pauper, it was really hard for the rich lady, Bai Jingshu, to know such a person! ”

“Hearing this, ye Sui immediately turned to look at Zhou Ziyue and frowned. “What did you say? You haven’t made things clear with Feng Yang Yet?” ”

“”I can’t let myself throw away the watermelon and pick up the Sesame!”Zhou ziyue continued, “I advise you to stop Dreaming!” ”

“It was all ye Sui’s fault for thinking too optimistically. Otherwise, Zhou Ziyue would not have had such high expectations for today’s blind date! ”

“If she had known this would happen, she wouldn’t have agreed to go on the blind date today! ”

What Bad Luck!

“Ye Sui said, “I’ll Call Your Dad Right Now!” ”

“As soon as he said that, ye Sui took out his phone and immediately called his husband. ”

On the other side.

“After Bai Jingshu returned, Lin ze asked, “How was it?” ”

Bai Jingshu looked dejected. “You really guessed it right! Ziyue didn’t fancy Zheng Ke!”

“Lin Ze handed Bai Jingshu a glass of water. “I told you that you thought Zhou Ziyue was too innocent, but you didn’t believe me. So, now you believe me?” ”

“I still think there’s a misunderstanding.”Bai Jingshu took the glass of water from Lin Ze and took a sip. “Do you think Zheng Ke isn’t Ziyue’s Type?”

“Although Zheng Ke was quite handsome, what if Zhou Ziyue liked a tough guy? ”

“After all, everyone had their own preferences. ”

“Lin Ze didn’t want to interfere in this matter, but he didn’t want to see Bai Jingshu being cheated by Zhou Ziyue. He said, “Actually, it’s easy to find out if Zhou Ziyue is looking for a rich second generation.” ”

“Why?”Bai Jingshu asked immediately.

“Lin Ze sat up straight and said, “Go and tell Zhou Ziyue to introduce her to someone else.” ”

“”Introduce her to someone else?”Bai Jingshu asked in confusion, “What do you mean?” ”

“”Don’t worry, let me tell you,”Lin ze continued, “Go and tell her that this family is very well-off, but the external conditions may not be that good...” ”

Bai Jingshu frowned. “But there has to be such a person!”

“”I do have one here,”Lin ze said. ”

“Who is it?”Bai Jingshu asked.

“Lin Ze said, “It’s Ma Lu.” ”

“Ma Lu was Lin Ze’s high school classmate. Her family background was very good, and she was a standard scion of an aristocratic family. Unfortunately, her paternal genes were not very good. Ma Lu was less than 1.6 meters tall, her looks were rough, and her skin was not good... ”

“Then what if Ziyue really agreed to go on a blind date?”

“”Then let’s go.”Lin Ze smiled and said, “Ma Lu’s biggest interest is to teach green tea ancestor how to be a person.” ”

“After saying that, Lin ze continued, “How about it? Do you want to try?” ”

Bai Jingshu hesitated for a moment. “Is it not good to lie?”

“This is not called lying.”

“Bai Jingshu was still a little hesitant. She drank another mouthful of water and said, “Okay, then you tell your classmate.” ”

“Okay.”Lin Ze picked up his phone. “I sent you Ma Lu’s photo.”

Bai Jingshu clicked on the photo.

It was indeed not pretty.

“Bai Jingshu continued, “Then should I go look for Ziyue Now?” ”

“Go ahead.”Lin Ze nodded. “I’ll Call Ma Lu and let her know.”

“Okay.”

Bai Jingshu came to the guest room again.

“Seeing Bai Jingshu come over, Ye Sui was still as enthusiastic. ”

“”Second aunt, are you alone? Where’s Ziyue?”Bai Jingshu asked. ”

“Ye Sui smiled and said, “She’s reading in the back room. I’ll go get her for you.” ”

“”No need, no need.”Bai Jingshu grabbed ye Sui’s arm and continued, “Second aunt, actually, it’s the same if I tell you about this.” ”

“”Okay, then tell me about it,”ye Sui said. ”

Bai Jingshu sat on the sofa. “Today’s matter didn’t succeed. I feel that I’ve let Ziyue down and let her come all this way for nothing.”

“Hearing that.., ye Sui smiled and said, “How can you say that, Jingshu! It should be our Ziyue who has let you down! I’ve heard from Ziyue that the man is actually a pretty good person. Unfortunately, he’s not Ziyue’s Type! “Jingshu, thank you so much. You’ve put in so much effort.” ”

“Although he was complaining that Bai Jingshu had introduced Zhou Ziyue to a pauper, ye Sui could not express it directly. ”

He still had to act what he had to do.

“No matter what, he was still in the Lin family. ”

“Bai Jingshu continued, “I still have a boy here. I wonder if Jingshu would be interested in getting to know him.” ”

“At this point, Bai Jingshu paused and continued, “This boy and Ah Ze are classmates. He is the heir to the family business. He is very outstanding...” ”

“Hearing this, ye Sui’s eyes almost shone with Starlight! ”

The heir to the family business!

Oh My God!

He must be very rich.

“Ye Sui continued, “Actually, it doesn’t matter whether he comes from a rich family or not. The main thing is that the two of them can see eye to eye.” ”

“”Second aunt, you’re absolutely right.”Bai Jingshu nodded in agreement. “The main thing is that the two of them can develop feelings for each other.” ”

“Ye Sui asked, “In that case, the boy is also from the capital?” ”

“”Yes, he’s from the capital.” ”

“Ye Sui hid the excitement in his heart and continued, “I don’t care about Ziyue’s matters either. I’ll tell her about this. If she’s willing to meet, I’ll have to trouble Jingshu to arrange for them to meet.” ”

“”Sure.”Bai Jingshu nodded and stood up from the sofa. “Second aunt, that’s settled then. I’ll go back first.” ”

“”Okay, you can go back.”Ye Sui stood up to send Bai Jingshu off. ”

“After walking out of the door, ye Sui seemed to have thought of something and continued, “Jingshu, what’s the name of the boy you mentioned just now?” ”

“Bai Jingshu said, “His name is Ma Lu, the heir of the Feli Group.” ”

“”Okay, okay, okay.”Ye Sui nodded. ”

“After Bai Jingshu left, ye Sui immediately went to Zhou Ziyue’s room. ”

“Just as he reached the door of Zhou Ziyue’s room, he heard voices from inside. ”

It was Zhou Ziyue on the phone with Feng Yang.

“Ye Sui frowned slightly, then reached out and slammed the door hard. “Ziyue! Ziyue!” ”

“Zhou Ziyue heard the voices and said into the phone, “Feng Yang, my mom said that I have something to do. I’m hanging up now.” ”

“Hang up. We’ll talk later.”

“Okay.” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“After hanging up the phone, Zhou Ziyue opened the door impatiently. “Mom, What’s wrong this time?” ”

“Ye Sui smiled and said, “There’s a big happy event!” ”

“What’s The Big Happy Event?”Zhou Ziyue asked.

“Ye Sui continued, “Bai Jingshu just came over and said that she wanted to introduce you to a boyfriend.” ”

“”She said the same thing yesterday,”Zhou Ziyue said. ”

“”This time is different,”ye Sui continued, “Just now, Bai Jingshu came over and said that she wanted to introduce you to the heir of the Phyllis Group. What’s the name of the heir? Ma...” Ye Sui suddenly couldn’t remember the name that Bai Jingshu mentioned. “Ma Lu! Yes, Ma Lu!” ”

“Hearing this, Zhou Ziyue narrowed her eyes. “Is That So?” ”

“”Of course!”Ye Sui said, “This time, I’ve helped you ask clearly. That Maru is a real bachelor! You have to grasp it well this time!” ”

“Zhou Ziyue still didn’t believe it. She continued, “Mom, which group did you say it was?” ”

“The Phyllis Group.”

“I’ll use my heavenly eye to check if there’s such a group.”Zhou Ziyue took out her phone.

“After a while, Zhou Ziyue looked up at ye Sui excitedly. “Mom, are you sure it’s the Fei Li Group?” ”

“Yes.”

“Zhou Ziyue continued to look down and said, “Is it called Ma Lu?” ”

“”Yes, yes, yes! It’s Ma Lu!”Ye Sui became even more excited. “Did you find out?” ”

“Zhou Ziyue nodded. “I did find out, but I saw on the Internet that this Ma Lu is very ugly.” ”

“Hearing that, Ye Sui was a little speechless. “So what if she’s ugly? Haven’t you heard of ugly people being blessed?” ”

“As long as one had money, no matter how ugly they were, ye Sui could tolerate them. ”

“Zhou ziyue frowned. She was unwilling, and she didn’t want to marry such an ugly person. ”

“”Don’t look down on her for being ugly!”Ye Sui continued, “Ziyue, actually, you have to recognize yourself. You’re just average-looking.” ”

“As soon as he said this, ye Sui continued, “Quickly break up with Feng Yang. I’ll reply to Bai Jingshu and ask her to arrange for you to meet Xiao Ma.” ”
