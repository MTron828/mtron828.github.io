Professor Cara was very excited now. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“He had waited for so long and thought that YC had seen through their plan. Otherwise, YC would not have been afraid to sign the betting agreement until now.”

“In the end, he had overestimated YC. If YC was really that powerful, they would not have agreed!”

“Cara turned to look at her assistant and continued, “Did YC say when they will sign the agreement?””

“The assistant said, “She said that she can do it anytime.””

“”Okay, okay, okay!”Dr. Carla nodded and said, “Quickly contact Dr. Orvis and Dr. Tina!””

The assistant nodded. “Okay! I’ll contact them right away!”

The assistant quickly went to contact the other doctors.

“On the other side, five doctors from other countries immediately flew over after hearing about this matter and discussed it with Dr. Carla.”

“In the end, the six doctors worked together to draft the gambling agreement and posted it on the Internet.”

“However, ye Zao did not immediately respond after it was posted on the Internet.”

The doctors from country C were a little anxious.

“Tina asked, “Did YC go back on his word?””

“Dr. Cara narrowed her eyes. “If she says something, it’ll be a waste of time. It Won’t be so easy for her to regret it!””

They had chased out the betting agreement overnight. YC wanted to run away?

No Way!

“For a moment, the international netizens were in a heated discussion.”

[ I guess YC wouldn’t dare to sign this betting agreement! ]

[ it would be strange if she dared to sign it. ]

“[ I read the agreement very carefully. It means that if YC can’t create an aircraft carrier within two years, C, G, P, Japan, L, and the other six countries will follow the agreement and have the authority to manage the entire CEN research base. In addition, all the assets and companies under YC will belong to the above six countries! ]”

“[ let alone YC, I wouldn’t even dare to sign it! ]”

[ didn’t YC promise to sign the bet before? Why aren’t you saying anything now? Are You Afraid? ]

“[ she’s definitely afraid. Otherwise, why didn’t she make a statement for a long time? ]”

“[ YC doesn’t even know how to store a nuclear reactor. It’s impossible for her to build an aircraft carrier! ]! Now, they even need to use the CEN research base. Even if she wanted to sign the BET, the CEN Research Base’s fifth master wouldn’t let her sign it! ]”

“The CEN research base was the largest research base in China, and the forces behind the CEN family were enormous.”

“If ye Zao could not build an aircraft carrier within two years, both the CEN research base and the mysterious forces behind CEN Shaoqing would belong to C Nation and the other five countries!”

This was a huge blow to both the CEN Group and the Chinese Research Community!

“Therefore, this was no longer a matter for ye Zao alone.”

This was a matter that concerned the entire CEN base.

“As long as Cen Shaoqing was not stupid, he would not allow a woman to control him.”

Who said that our Father Ye is afraid? Our Father Ye is not afraid

“Father Ye, Father Ye, we will always support you”

“[ father, you can do it! ]”

“[ I believe in YC, father. Your sons will always be your strongest support. ]”

Those who supported ye Zao were naturally members of the NIU Hulu family.

“At present, the large group of members of the NIU Hulu family already numbered in the tens of thousands. These people were all well-known in the scientific research world.”

“Although ye Zao’s aircraft carrier plan seemed somewhat unrealistic, after all, hundreds of countries around the world had joined forces to not create an aircraft carrier.”

But Ye Zao’s existence itself was a BUG!

She had created a lot of impossibilities for China’s scientific research!

“As people who had watched ye Zao’s rise from an unknown junior in the scientific and technological world to an irreplaceable dark horse, they firmly believed that this time, ye Zao would definitely be the same as before, bringing them a miracle!”

This group of cute scientific researchers was different from ordinary star chasers.

Fans chased their idols and hobbies.

“But to them, YC was the rise of an era, the symbol of an era, light, and even more so, faith!”

YC was an unsurpassable role model in this era.

“[ stop washing the brainless fans of YC. It’s so disgusting, they’re almost turning the scientific research world into a food circle. ]”

[ I really have to give it to them. Did YC feed them ecstasy? They’re so loyal to YC. It’s like they’re crazy. ]

[ I don’t think YC should stay in the research industry. She should go to the entertainment industry. ]

“[ I remember that she once participated in a variety show in China. It was quite popular at that time. But later, for some reason, the program team suddenly cut all of her scenes. I can’t find any news about her on the Internet. ]”
