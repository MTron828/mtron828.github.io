Old Lady Li had everything she wanted in the Li family. She had never been wronged before. This was the first time.

“Moreover, the other party was only a little girl about the same age as Li Yueyue. ”

How could this feel good?

“Hearing this, Li Yueyue smiled and said, “Zhuoluo, you’re the best. That person, my grandmother, even my mother has to give in to her!” ”

“Fang yinyue was not a soft person, but in front of old madam Li, she had always suppressed her temper. ”

“Hearing that old madam Li had suffered a loss at ye Zhuozhuo, Li Yueyue felt very happy. ”

“”I can see that,”ye Zhuozhuo continued, “Your grandmother’s temper should have been spoiled by your family.” ”

A mother was kind and filial to her son.

“The premise was that a mother was kind and loving, and only children would be filial to her. People like old madam Li could not be spoiled. ”

“Li Yueyue nodded, she lowered her voice and said, “My father is very traditional. He thinks that there are no parents in the world who aren’t parents. In the past, he would nod his head no matter what my grandmother said. He never said the word ‘no’, but he’s much better now.” ”

“After saying that, Li Yueyue continued, “By the way, Zhonghua, your flight is at three in the afternoon, right?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zouzhuo nodded slightly. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Li Yueyue continued, “Then I’ll send you guys off in the afternoon.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zouyue changed the topic. “We’re playing chess in the house. Do you want to come in and play a game?”

“”No, no, no. I don’t know how to play chess. My mom is still waiting for me. I’ll go back and take a look first.”The young couple was playing chess in the house. What was she going to do by following them? Be a third wheel? ”

“Moreover, Li Yueyue was also pestering Cen Shaoqing. ”

“It was a very strange feeling. Cen Shaoqing clearly didn’t do anything, but Li Yueyue was subconsciously afraid. ”

“As long as Cen Shaoqing was there, Li Yueyue didn’t even dare to speak loudly. ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Then take care on the road.”

“It was a 500-meter journey from the plum garden to the main hall. In addition, the weather had been bad for the past two days. There was a thick layer of ice on the road. If one wasn’t careful, it was very easy to slip. ”

“”Yes, I know.”Li Yueyue returned to the main hall. ”

“The moment she returned, Fang yinyue stood up and asked, “How was it? What did Miss Ye Say?” ”

“Li Yueyue smiled and said, “I heard that she was quite angry.” ”

“Who was quite angry? Your Grandmother?”Fang yinyue asked.

“Yes.”Li Yueyue nodded.

Fang yinyue heaved a sigh of relief. “Your grandmother finally met a big shot this time!”Fang yinyue was very much looking forward to Old Lady Li’s defeated look.

“Li Yueyue said worriedly, “Mom, do you think my grandmother will make a scene when the time comes?” ”

“Make a scene? How?”Fang yinyue asked.

“Li Yueyue continued, “She will make a scene at searing fire.”Old Lady Li was not someone who would suffer a loss. If she really made a scene at ye searing’s place, there would be no end to it. ”

“Fang yinyue smiled and said, “Don’t worry, she wouldn’t dare.” ”

“Is that so?”Li Yueyue asked.

“Fang yinyue said, “She’s not stupid. If she dares to stir up trouble over at Miss Ye’s place, what’s the difference from bringing humiliation upon herself?”Who Was Ye Zao? ”

Would she coddle Old Lady Li?

“Even if Old Lady Li was given 120 guts, she would not dare to go over to Ye Zao’s place to cause trouble again. ”

“Just as they were talking, footsteps sounded outside the house. ”

Fang yinyue immediately shut up and looked outside.

Li Yueyue also looked up.

She saw old madam Li walking over with her walking stick.

Li Yueyue immediately went up to greet her. “Grandma.”

Old Madam Li’s face was gloomy and she did not say anything.

“Li Shuyi was already locked up, but Li Yueyue was completely fine. ”

Sisters!

Was there such a sister in the world?

She had no conscience at all.

To think that Li Shuyi was usually so good to Li Yueyue!

Being good to Li Yueyue was better than being good to a dog!

Old Madam Li’s heart was filled with an evil aura.

“Fang yinyue said, “Mother, you went to look for Miss Ye. What did she say?” ”

Asking despite knowing the answer!

Fang yinyue was asking despite knowing the answer.

“The mother and daughter were exactly the same. Not only did they not care about Li Shuyi, they even gloated over her misfortune. ”

Old Madam Li was even angrier.

What kind of sin had she committed in her past life to meet such a troublemaker’s daughter-in-law in this life.

She had stirred up trouble for the entire family.

“If it were not for Fang yinyue stirring up trouble inside, Li Shuyi would never have been locked up in the detention center. ”

“As long as she thought of the anger she had just received from ye Zhuo, Old Lady Li wished she could strangle Li Shuyi to death. ”

B * Tch!

People were dying every day in this world. Why didn’t she die?

“It was true that good people didn’t live long, but evil lingered for a thousand years! ”

“Old Lady Li raised her head to look at Fang yinyue and angrily questioned, “Let me ask you, do you really treat Shuyi as your niece? !” ”
