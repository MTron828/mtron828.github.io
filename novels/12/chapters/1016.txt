“If Ye Shu was not ye Dahai’s daughter, then what about Ye Sen? ”

“After all, there was still some similarity between Ye Shu and ye Sen! ”

The two looked very similar...

“Cao Wei continued, “Miss Ye, did you hear your mother talk about her background at home?” ” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ye Zhuo shook his head. “No.”Perhaps even ye Shu herself did not know that there was a problem with her background.

“After saying that, Ye Zhuo continued to ask, “Mr. Cao, are you sure that this is true?” ”

“Cao Wei said, “Miss Ye, do you and your mother have a small red mole on their right hand?” ”

Ye Zhuo lowered his head to look at his right hand.

He saw that there was indeed a small red mole on the side of the little finger on his right hand.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “I do have a small red mole on my hand, but I’m not sure if my mother has it. “You said that you’ve found my mother’s biological mother, so can you arrange for us to meet? “Now that the technology is so advanced, a paternity test is enough. There’s no need to go through so much trouble.” ”

“Elder Zhang, who had been silent the whole time, suddenly said, “Miss Ye, the truth is...” ”

“Elder Zhang told ye Zhuo everything that had happened, including the Xi family. ”

Ye Langhua?

Half a month?

Could it be Auntie Lang?

Ye Zhuo had known for more than a month that Auntie Lang had found her biological daughter.

But she did not know that there were so many twists and turns.

She did not expect ye Shu to be related to Auntie Lang.

“Are you talking about Auntie Lang?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“Elder Zhang was stunned. “Miss Ye, you know Lang Hua?” ”

“Ye Zhuo said, “The aunt Lang I know runs a private restaurant in Wutong Alley for half a month. I wonder if we’re talking about the same person?” ”

“It’s the same person!”Elder Zhang nodded quickly. “It’s the same person! Lang Hua also has a private restaurant in Wutong Alley!”

“”Then it’s the same person!”Ye Zhuo continued, “But Aunt Lang’s biological daughter has already been found and a paternity test has been done. Are you sure the XI family tampered with the paternity test?” ”

Ye Zhuo did not know about the past. She just felt that no father would treat his own biological daughter like this.

“Elder Zhang continued to nod. “Miss Ye, you’ve just arrived in the capital and there are many things that you don’t understand. Xi Muwen isn’t as kind as he looks. Lang Hua was destroyed by his hands.” Elder Zhang’s thoughts sank into his memories as he continued, “Back then, Lang Hua was famous all over the capital. She was a famous talented girl...” ”

Ye Zhuo listened very seriously.

She did not expect Aunt Lang to have so many stories hidden behind her.

“For a moment, she could not help but sigh. ”

“However, from the sound of it, she felt that this matter was not Xi Muwen’s fault alone. ”

There was something wrong with Aunt Lang herself for causing such a consequence.

“She should not have been so decadent after she had been lost for half a month, and she should not have let Xi Muwen forcefully take over the Ye Group. ”

She should have toughened up.

Perhaps this was what it meant to be hurt by extreme wisdom!

“After listening to Auntie Lang’s story, Ye Zhuo looked up at elder Zhang. “Elder Zhang, I already know about the matter. Don’t worry, if Auntie Lang is really my mother’s biological mother, then I definitely won’t sit idly by.” ”

“Elder Zhang continued, “Then why don’t we add her on wechat? When you go back, first check if your mother has a small red mole on her right hand. After checking, can you tell me on wechat?” ”

“Sure.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

Elder Zhang took out his phone. “Then I’ll scan you.”

Ye Zhuo also took out his phone.

The two of them added each other on wechat.

Ye Zhuo and the counselor took a day off and then went to the Ye’s private kitchen’s main store in Beijing.

“Although ye Shu was already the boss, she would help out in the restaurant every day and strive for the best service. If there was anything that was lacking, she would immediately correct it. ”

“The business of the Ye family’s private restaurant was even more prosperous than when they were in Yun Jing. Every day, they would line up from the start of business. ”

“When Ye Zhuo arrived, Ye Shu was ordering for the customers. “For the three of you, I suggest that you order these dishes. If you order more, you might not be able to finish them. If you don’t have enough to eat later, you can add more.” ”

“”Okay, that’s it then.”The customer closed the menu. “Thank you.” ”

“It’s my pleasure.”

Ye Zao stood at the side and his gaze fell on Ye Shu’s hand.

He saw that there was indeed a small red mole on ye Shu’s right hand.

“”Zao Zao!”At this moment, Lin Ze’s voice suddenly appeared in the air. ”

Ye Zao turned to look at Lin Ze. “Brother! Why are you here?”
