“If Lin Shasha could get into university, she wouldn’t have to wait until now. ”

“Lin Jinshui looked at Lin Shasha and said, “It’s okay, it’s okay! If we don’t do well this year, we’ll continue to work hard next year. Huang Zhong met Liu Bei at the age of 60, Tokugawa Jiakang won the world at the age of 70, Jiang Ziya became the prime minister at the age of 80, and you’re only 23 this year. What are you afraid of? !” ”

“Zhou yuelian nodded and said, “Your Father Is Right, Shasha. Don’t be discouraged. At most, we’ll continue to take the exam!” ”

“Hearing that.., zhou yuelian frowned and said, “I say, how do you two educate your children? What do you mean, continue to take the exam next year? Shasha is 23 this year! She’s not 13! If you ask me, I think it’s better to give up on the college entrance exam as soon as possible! There is a boy in our neighborhood who is quite suitable for Sasha. Although he was divorced, didn’t Sasha get pregnant too? Don’t look down on this and that! The Golden Age of a girl is 22-25 years old. After this age, you won’t be able to find a good family!” ”

“As her aunt, Zhou Yuelan was sincerely looking out for Sasha. ”

“Although the boy who lived in the same neighborhood as her was divorced, he was about the same age as Lin Shasha and didn’t have any children. The key was that he came from a good family background. ”

“Thinking of this, Zhou Yuelan continued, “The boy’s parents are doing business abroad, and they even hired a nanny. Don’t Worry, Shasha, Aunt Won’t harm you!” ” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Seeing that Zhou Yuelan seemed to have misunderstood something, Lin Shasha quickly explained, “Aunt, you misunderstood, i...” ”

“”You what? !”Zhou Yuelan directly interrupted Lin Shasha’s words, “Shasha, don’t tell me you still look down on him? Although he’s divorced, he doesn’t have any children, and his age is about the same as yours! If it were someone else, I wouldn’t be willing to introduce him! Don’t even think about the college entrance exam! Everyone has their own fate, you’re not born to study! “You’re not born to have an iron rice bowl!” ”

“At this point, Zhou Yuelan paused, then, she said, “Aunt knows that you were unconvinced when you saw your cousin get into two good universities, but can your cousin be like you? “Your cousin has been smart since she was young. She’s not the same as you! “Moreover, this kind of thing can’t be solved just because you’re unconvinced!” ”

“The cousin that Zhou Yueran was talking about was her youngest daughter, Renee. Renee had taken the college entrance exam last year and got into a second university. Zhou Yueran was so happy that she had invited more than ten tables of guests. ”

But how could Lin Sha Compare to Renee?

Renee had been smart since she was young. She was born to study.

“After she finished junior high, Lin Sha dropped out of school and went to work in the factory. She even found a boyfriend and got pregnant. Before that, Lin Sha had always been the negative example that Zhou Yueran was talking about. ”

Renee also looked down on her cousin.

“Hearing her mother’s words, Renee, who was sitting on the sofa, curled her lips. ”

“She was studying in C City and had found a local boyfriend. In the future, Lin Shasha really couldn’t be compared to her. ”

A person like Lin Shasha could only marry a second-marriage man.

So what if the second-marriage man’s family was rich?

The second-marriage man didn’t earn the money by himself!

“In the future, he would only be able to eat the mountain dry! ”

“But she was different. Her boyfriend and she were classmates. They were both college students. If they worked together in the future, their days would definitely be more prosperous. ”

“Zhou Yuelan continued, “Shasha, did you hear what I Said? Just accept your fate! Your parents are old. Don’t bother them anymore? “The boy I mentioned is really not bad! “How about I take you to meet him tomorrow? I’m telling you, if you miss this village, you won’t have this shop anymore!” ”

“”Sister, Our Shasha isn’t in a hurry to get married yet,”Zhou Yuelian said. ”

“Lin Jinshui nodded in agreement. “Yes, yes, yes! Her aunt, thank you for Your Kindness, but Our Shasha isn’t in a hurry yet.” ”

“These two were honest people, and they were too embarrassed to directly refuse. ”

“Zhou Yuelan then turned to look at Zhou Yuelian, “Yuelian, the reason Sha Sha has become like this is all because of you two spoiling her! Look at what she’s become now! If this continues. She’ll definitely become an old family member! How many 23-year-old girls have you seen like her! She has achieved nothing! If I wasn’t her aunt, I wouldn’t have bothered to care about her!” ”

“Lin Sha looked at Zhou Yuelan and the anger in her heart disappeared completely. She then said, “Thank you for your concern, aunt, but I don’t need you to care about me.” ”

“After saying that, Lin Sha turned to look at Lin Jinshui and Zhou Yuelian. She said slowly, “Dad, Mom, I got 740 marks. I’m the first place in Yunjing City.” ”
