“”Young miss, do you have any other orders?”Ye Lan turned to look at Qiu Di. ”

“Qiu Di held a pen in his hand and continued, “Do you want to hurry and change the name of the Ye family’s base?” ”

Ye Lan looked at Qiu Di in surprise.

This...

It didn’t seem like Qiu Di’s style.

“Or, was Qiu di blaming her for not doing her job well? ”

“Qiu Di continued, “Haste makes waste. Right now, the hearts of the people of the Ye family base are with ye Zao. Some Things will backfire if done too far!” ”

Qiu Di wasn’t a fool.

“The most important thing for her now was to immediately ascend to the position of the female sovereign and guide the country, leading the country of Chang Yue to the next peak. ”

“Currently, she had the password to the information on the star-crossing case, and she also had the full support of the sixth elder, Ye Lan, and the others. was she afraid that those people would object? ”

“Not to mention the sixth elder, Just Ye Lan’s support was enough. ”

Who Was Ye Lan?

“Ye Zhuo’s sister, the leader of the Ye family base. ”

“Therefore, the most important thing for her now was to hold ye Lan and the sixth elder tightly. ”

“Qiu Di nodded. “I understand, eldest miss.” ”

“Go.”Qiu Di waved his hand.

Ye Lan turned around and walked out.

“After taking a few steps, ye Lan seemed to have thought of something. She turned around and looked at Qiu Di. After hesitating for a while, she said, “Eldest miss.” ”

“”If you have something to say, just say it.”Qiu Di took a sip of tea. “I’m different from ye Zao.” ”

“Hearing this, the nervousness on ye Lan’s face disappeared completely. She looked up at Qiu di with a smile and continued, “Young miss, has there been any news... about my parents?” ”

This was the most important reason for ye Lan to seek refuge with Qiu Di.

Qiu Di had promised ye Lan that she would definitely help ye Lan find her biological parents.

“”En.”Qiu Di nodded, then, she said, “If you hadn’t said it, I would have forgotten. I’ve already asked Skynet to look into it. According to the information they sent back, it’s very likely that you’re the Manxing Kingdom’s ruler and mother who lost her first wife in the early years.” ”

First wife Princess!

Manxing Kingdom!

She didn’t expect that she actually had the royal bloodline.

“In that case, she would inherit the Manxing Kingdom’s throne in the future! ”

“Hearing this, Ye Lan’s face was full of shock. ”

“”Eldest miss, is this, is this true?” ”

“”Of course it’s true.”Qiu Di walked over and smiled as he held ye Lan’s hand, “Sister Ye Lan, if one day you are recognized by the Manxing Kingdom, don’t forget about me as your elder sister. When that time comes, our changyue kingdom and the Manxing Kingdom will join hands. Even the insect race will fear us!” ”

“Of course!”Ye Lan held Qiu Di’s hand. She was so excited that she didn’t know how to say it. “Sister treats me better than her own sister. I will definitely repay you!”

“Okay.”Qiu Di nodded.

Ye Lan was extremely grateful to Qiu Di.

She wanted to kneel down and kowtow to Qiu Di.

“After a while, ye LAN continued, “Young miss, when will this matter be settled?” ”

She had been separated from her parents for so many years. She had long wanted to return to their side and reunite with her family!

“”We are still investigating. Don’t be anxious. There are still some matters that have not been settled. After all, we are of the royal bloodline. We can not be so careless!”Qiu Di patted ye Lan’s hand, she continued, “Don’t worry. I am not the same type of person as ye Zao. I will definitely not be like ye Zao and stop you from finding your biological parents. As soon as the results are out, I will inform you immediately!” ” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“The subtext of this sentence was that ye Zao had clearly found out ye Lan’s true identity back then, but he had kept it a secret. It was clearly intentional. ”

“Without batting an eyelid, he had once again stirred up the feelings between ye Lan and ye Zao. ”

“Ye Lan was so moved that her eyes were red. “Eldest miss, thank you! You’re really a good person!” ”

Qiu Di was indeed different from ye Zao.

“If it was ye Zao, he would definitely not treat her like this. ”

Ye Lan was very regretful now.

She regretted not knowing Qiu di earlier.

“Why are you still saying thank you to me?”Qiu Di helped Ye Lan Wipe away her tears.

“Ye Lan, who was immersed in her own world, did not notice that Qiu Di’s eyes were filled with sarcasm. ”

Idiot.

He was simply the biggest idiot!

“Without a princess’s life, she would only dream of being a princess. ”

This kind of person was the most disgusting!

“Even on the way back, Ye Lan was floating in the air. ”

It turned out that she actually had the bloodline of the royal family.

Ye Zhuo had always thought of ways to prevent her from finding her biological parents.

“If she was found by her biological parents, she would definitely inherit the throne in the future. In the future, wouldn’t she be on equal footing with Ye Zhuo? ”

“In the end, Ye Zao was still jealous of her. ”

How Shameless!
