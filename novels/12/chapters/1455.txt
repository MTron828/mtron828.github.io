Chapter 1456: 310: she stood out like a crane in a flock of chickens! 3

Translator: 549690339

This was Cen Yueya’s voice!

He did not expect ye Zhuo to have this ability.

Cen Shaoqing was also stunned.

“He even suspected that there was something wrong with his sense of smell. The fragrance that lingered at the tip of his nose was clearly unique to ye Zhuo, but this voice belonged to Cen Yueya. ”

“Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted slightly. “Leader, second sister is here too?” ”

Ye Zao released his hand and chuckled. “Yes.”

Cen Shaoqing looked up and saw Cen Yueya’s figure.

“What was that voice just now?”Cen Shaoqing asked curiously.

“Take a guess.”Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly.

“Cen Shaoqing said in surprise, “You imitated it?” ”

“Does it look like it?”Ye Zao asked.

“”Yes, very much so. I thought second sister was here!”Cen Shaoqing gave ye Zao a thumbs up. “Leader, you’re really amazing!” ”

“”That’s true.”Ye Zao had a proud look on his face. “Otherwise, how would I lead you?” ”

“That makes sense.”Cen Shaoqing agreed with Ye Zao’s words.

“Seeing this scene, the secretary at the side thought that he was hallucinating. ”

Was this still the fifth master cen of the kaolin flower that he knew? Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

How did he become a bootlicker!

“At this moment, the secretary could only shout loudly, “Miss Ye is awesome!”! ”

“Previously, there were many talents in the base who were discussing how Miss Ye managed to woo master five when he was so cold and aloof. ”

Now it seemed.

Master five was clearly the one chasing after Miss Ye!

“How much longer do you need to finish your work?”Ye Zhuo continued to ask.

Cen Shaoqing flipped a page of the document in his hand. “About ten minutes or so.”

“Do you need help?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“No need. You can just sit there.”

Ye Zao nodded and sat on the chair. He took out his phone and started playing games.

“In the quiet space, the sound of games could be heard from time to time. ”

One kill!

Three kills!

Five kills!

“When he looked at Cen Shaoqing again, there was no reaction at all. ”

The Secretary felt that Cen Shaoqing had double standards.

“When Cen Shaoqing was single, he ziteng often came to the base office to look for him. Cen Shaoqing was busy, so he ziteng would take out his phone and play games. ”

“Cen Shaoqing would not only call he ziteng a retard, but he would also chase he ziteng out. ”

“Now that it was ye Zhuo, Cen Shaoqing actually did not dare to say a word. ”

“Very soon, ten minutes had passed. Cen Shaoqing finished the last document and stood up to look at Ye Zhuo. “Leader, we can leave now.” ”

Ye Zhuo stuffed the phone into CEN Shaoqing’s hands. “This round isn’t over yet. Help me play a bit. I’m going to the washroom.”

Cen Shaoqing took the phone. “Hurry up and go.”

The secretary from before was only slightly stunned. The secretary from now was stunned.

Playing games!

“In his lifetime, he had actually seen Cen Shaoqing playing online games! ”

It seemed that he was playing rather well.

“The secretary rubbed his eyes, afraid that he had seen wrongly. When he opened his eyes again, this scene still did not change. ”

The person playing the game was Cen Shaoqing.

“Not long after, Ye Zhuo came out of the bathroom. Cen Shaoqing had just finished one round and handed the phone to Ye Zhuo. ”

“That round just now ended?”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and twirled the Buddha beads.

“So Fast?”Ye Zhuo was a little surprised.

“”The other party surrendered,”cen Shaoqing continued, “Maybe I was too powerful and scared them.” ”

“You’re bragging.”Ye Zhuo put his phone into his pocket.

Half an hour later.

A handsome Maybach stopped at the entrance of the Lin family manor.

“The Butler immediately came out to welcome them. “Eldest miss, fifth master.” ”

“Ye Zhuo saw another car parked beside them. “Uncle Xiang, my uncle is back too?” ”

The butler nodded. “Yes.”

“”Apart from my uncle, is there anyone else?”Ye Zhuo continued to ask. ”

“The butler said, “Fourth master and his family of three have also returned.” ”

“OH.”

Cen Shaoqing took out a bunch of gifts from the trunk and followed ye Zhuo’s footsteps.

“Ye Zhuo said in surprise, “When did you prepare these?” ”

Cen Shaoqing lowered his voice. “Come to my father-in-law’s house. What does it look like to be empty-handed?”

It was not strange to be courteous.

“Moreover, he was still in his internship period. ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Is it heavy? Let me help you take some.” ”

“It’s not heavy.”Cen Shaoqing’s tone was indifferent.

“The Butler rushed over and said, “Fifth Master, let me help you take it.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing looked back slightly and said, “Sorry to trouble you, uncle. There are still some in the trunk.” ”

“Okay!”The Butler immediately went to the trunk and took out the rest of the things.

“The hall of the Lin family was very lively. They had not seen each other for a long time, and now they were all gathered together to chat. ”

The laughter continued.

“Burning and Shaoqing are back!”Xia Xiaoman stood up and said.
