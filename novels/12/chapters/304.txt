Ye Zao must be faking it!

Yes!

He must be faking it!

Ye Zao did not want to act like he had never seen the world before.

Although he knew that ye Zao was faking it.

“However, Li Boyang still felt that ye Zao was acting too much. ”

“Even if she was very surprised, he would not look down on her. ”

“After all, they were no longer from the same world. ”

“Li Boyang continued, “Ye Zao, didn’t you say that you also participated in the College Entrance Examination? How many points did you get?” ”

“Ye Zao looked at his phone and said casually, “749 points.” ”

749 points?

Li Boyang was speechless!

Ye Zao really knew how to Brag!

Why didn’t she say that she was the college entrance examination’s top scorer!

“”I heard that our Yun Jing’s top scorer also scored 749 points, right?”Li Boyang had heard about the matter of the top scorer and did not know his name. ”

“Ye Zhuo nodded. “That’s right, I am.” ”

She really dared to say it!

“”Ye Zhuo, stop joking!”! ”

Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly. “I’m not joking with you.”

“Li Boyang took a deep breath and continued, “Ye Zhuo, there’s something I want to talk to you about.” ”

“Speak.”

“Li Boyang continued, “I like you! I’ve liked you for a long, long time. Can you be my girlfriend? Can I bring you to Beijing? Even if you know that you didn’t take the college entrance exam, I Won’t look down on You! “I’ve already been accepted by Qinghua University. Couples should complement each other. You’re a junior high school student, and I’m a university student. In the future, I can teach you the knowledge that I’ve learned! “Just draw your own strengths and weaknesses!” ”

Li Boyang said everything he thought in one breath.

He knew that ye Zao would definitely agree to his request.

Because no one would refuse the pursuit of a highly educated person.

Qinghua University!

This was a school that many people dreamed of!

“After saying this, Ye Zao’s face did not show the expression that Li Boyang wanted. ”

What was going on?

Could it be that ye Zhuo was too excited?

Li Boyang was a little puzzled.

“The corners of Ye Zhuo’s mouth curled up. “I’m sorry, a junior high school student like me isn’t good enough for you.” ”

“He knew that ye Zhuo would not reject him. Li Boyang continued, “Although your academic qualifications are a little low, I don’t mind.” ”

“At this moment, a piece of news appeared on the big screen of the shopping mall behind ye Zhuo. ”

“”Let me introduce the top scorer of this year’s college entrance exam in Yunjing City, ye Zao! Ye Zao is a native of Yunjing city. He is 19 years old this year, and he obtained the best score in Yunjing City in the past 10 years, 749 points!” ”

“”Hello, everyone, I am ye Zao.” ”

“Hearing this familiar voice, Li Boyang thought he heard wrong. He looked up and saw that the person interviewed on the big screen was very familiar. ”

“This, this was really ye Zao? ”

It was really ye Zao!

“Li Boyang stood rooted to the ground, cold sweat beading on his back. ” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

He had never dreamed that ye Zao could be the top scorer.

He had never thought that ye Zao was really a senior.

It turned out that what ye Zao said before was true.

He felt like a clown.

“One second ago, he was proud of his 688 points. ”

“The next second, he was slapped in the face. ”

688 was nothing in front of 749?

He was not even a younger brother!

The sense of superiority in front of ye Zhuo immediately disappeared without a trace.

“Embarrassment, embarrassment, and all kinds of complicated emotions mixed together, making Li Boyang’s face instantly turn red, and he was so ashamed that he could not raise his head. ”

“Ye Zhuo was still in a hurry to buy things, so he did not say anything. As he walked to the mall, he opened wechat and deleted Li Boyang. ”

“Boyang!”

“At this moment, Qian Lingyu ran over from the other side. ”

“Mom...”Li Boyang turned to look at Qian Lingyu.

“Qian lingyu frowned and said, “Was that ye Zhuo who stood beside you just now?” ”

Li Boyang nodded.

“Qian Lingyu said angrily, “Boyang! How many times has mom told you to stop talking to people like Ye Zhuo! “She’s not from the same world as you! “You’re going to go to university soon. She can only be a part-time worker for the rest of her life! “You probably can’t ruin your future because of her!” ”

“In Qian Lingyu’s eyes, Li Boyang was a dragon among men! ”

No one could compare to her son!

“Although ye Zhuo was beautiful, she did not have a degree. She came from a wealthy family. Her family was so poor that she was not worthy of Li Boyang! ”

“Li Boyang’s expression was a little ugly. “Mom, you misunderstood! Ye Zao is not a part-time worker. She is the top scorer of this year’s College Entrance Exam!” ”

“Do you think your mom is a fool? How can she be the top scorer of this kind of person?”

“”I’m not lying to you! Ye Zao is already on the news. Just search on your phone and you’ll know!”After saying that, Li Boyang turned around and left. ”

Qian Lingyu quickly picked up her phone.

“If she didn’t search, she wouldn’t know. Once she searched, she was shocked. ”

“Not only was ye Zao the top scorer in this year’s college entrance exam, he was also the daughter of the Ye family’s private kitchen owner! ”

Qian Lingyu even thought that she was dreaming.

She pinched him hard.

It hurt!

It wasn’t a dream.

This was real.

“Qian Lingyu was very regretful. If she had known that ye Zao would become the top scorer in the college entrance exam, if her family was so rich, she would have treated ye Zao better back then. ”

It was useless to say anything now...

“In the blink of an eye, the next day arrived. Today was the day that old Mrs. Cen and ye Zao had agreed to go to the island for a holiday. ”

“Ye Zao was carrying his bag. Just as he walked out of the residential area, he saw Old Mrs. Cen standing in front of a black car and waving at her. “Yezi!” ”

“Grandma Cen.”Ye Zao jogged over.

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Let’s get in the car quickly.” ”

“After getting in the car, ye Zao realized that Cen Shaoqing was driving. ”

“After a while, they arrived at the dock. ”

A luxurious yacht was parked in front of the dock.

Ye Zao and Cen Shaoqing walked in front.

Old Mrs. Cen walked behind them.

“Looking at the figures of the two people in front, old Mrs. Cen lowered her voice and said, “Xiangxiang, I’m very worried about a problem.” ”

“What problem?”Zhou Xiang was curious.

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “I’m worried that Yezi will not be able to stand it when she gets together with Shaoqing in the future.” ”

“Zhou xiang asked in puzzlement, “Can’t stand what?” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen raised her head and looked in front of her. Ye Zhuo was standing on the yacht, and Cen Shaoqing was standing on the deck. The two of them were up and down. No one knew what they were talking about, but from old Mrs. Cen’s point of view.., she could see a faint smile between ye Zao’s eyebrows. ”

The beauty smiled and her eyes twinkled.

“The Moonlight was shy, and she held the golden outhouse. ”

“The sunlight penetrated through her from behind. The blue sky and white clouds were above her head, and the blue sea was under her feet. ”

The scene was so romantic that it was like a TV series.

“Old Mrs. Cen said in a low voice, “Look at how thin ye Zi’s waist is. Even the wind can blow her off! Our Young Minister can easily lift a barbell that weighs more than 200 Jin! Running for an hour without breathing! I’m afraid that Yezi’s small body won’t be able to bear it in the future... ... ...” ”
