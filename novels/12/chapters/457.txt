“CEN yueying said, “Zao Zao, my father-in-law was diagnosed with liver cancer not long ago. Can you please go to the hospital to have a look?” ”

Cen Yuyan was a little unhappy when she heard this.

Cen Yueying had clearly asked Song Chenyu to help her introduce gu dening more than ten minutes ago.

“Now that song Chenyu was sitting opposite her, Cen Yueying went to look for ye Zao. ”

“Ye Zao asked, “When did the old man find out?” ”

“”In March this year,”Cen Yueying answered. ”

Ye Zao nodded. “I happen to have nothing to do in the afternoon. Shall we go in the afternoon?”

“Hearing this, Cen yueying nodded excitedly. “Good, good, good. Zao Zao, thank you so much.” ”

“You’re welcome.”

“From the beginning to the end, there was no smug expression on ye Zao’s face. ”

“Cen Yuying was very satisfied with ye Zao. She held ye Zao’s hand and asked, “Searing, when did you start studying medicine?” ”

“Around the age of ten.”

“For a moment, the Cen family’s three sisters, who had been discussing gu dening beside song Chenyu, all sat beside ye Zao and became ye Zao’s little fans. ”

Cen Yuyan felt extremely uncomfortable.

She had brought song Chenyu over today because she wanted to show ye Zao his might.

“She wanted to let ye Zao know that the Cen family had a very high threshold, and ordinary people could not enter. ”

The Cen family’s young madam should have come from the capital!

How could a person from a small place like Yun Jing be worthy of marrying into the Cen family.

“Who would have thought that in the end, not only did she not show ye Zao his might, she was instead checkmated. ”

Ye Zao became Miracle Doctor Ye!

How could ye Zao Be Miracle Doctor Ye?

“The more Cen Yuyan thought about it, the more uncomfortable she felt. Song Chenyu patted Cen Yuyan’s hand. ”

Cen Yuyan turned around to look at song Chenyu. She saw a faint smile on song Chenyu’s face.

“From the beginning to the end, song Chenyu was very calm. ” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Cen Yuyan could not help but sigh. Song Chenyu was indeed worthy of being a female star who stood at the top of the entertainment industry.

“If it was anyone else, they might not be able to be as calm as song Chenyu. ”

“Thinking of this, the gloomy look on Cen Yuyan’s face faded a little. ”

She had to learn song Chenyu’s handling style!

“”Old Madam, this is the lychee that just arrived.”A servant jogged in from outside. ”

Old Madam Cen stood up. “Quickly put it on the table.”

The servant placed the lychee on the table.

“Old Mrs. Cen changed the Lotus Mist in front of the lychee and ye Zao. “Yezi, eat the lychee. I bought this lychee for you!” ”

Song Chenyu recognized the king of Lychees at a glance.

Green Lychee.

“Green lychees were rare, and they were sold by the market. In the most ridiculous year, one green lychee was sold at auction for 550,000 yuan. ”

“Now was not the time to eat lychees, and the price had increased several times. Although it was only a small plate, the price had already exceeded seven figures. Moreover, it was the kind that could not be bought even if one had money. ”

It seemed that old lady cen really liked ye Zao.

Ye Zao really liked Lychees.

“Unfortunately, the juice of green lychees was too full. As long as ye Zao peeled one, the juice would flow all over his hand and become sticky. Just as Ye Zao was hesitating whether to Peel it, Cen Shaoqing put down the Buddhist beads in his hand and picked up a lychee. ”

“In the next second, a crystal clear lychee meat was handed to ye Zao. ”

Ye Zao naturally took the lychee.

Song Chenyu’s gaze swept over the two of them.

It would be a lie to say that he was not shocked.

This was Cen Wu Ye.

Everyone in the capital knew Cen Wu Ye. He believed in Buddhism and was like a devil. His methods were cold. He even once said that he would never marry and even rejected the number one beauty of Persia.

But now...

Old Madam Cen and Zhou Xiang were already used to it.

But the four cen sisters were very surprised.

“Especially Cen Yueya, she was so excited that she was about to scream. ”

“Although Cen Shaoqing was her younger brother,. ”

“Cen Shaoqing had been young and mature since he was young, and he had his own ideas. Ever since he became famous in China at the age of eighteen, even Cen Yueya, his older sister, was a little afraid of him. ”

“Usually, he would only joke when it was appropriate. ”

But now.

“After being tempered to a hundred percent steel, he did a finger-twirling softener. ”

This was really like one thing subduing another!

“Old Mrs. Cen stood up from the sofa. “I’m going to the kitchen to see how the dishes for lunch are doing. Fourth girl, come over and see what you want to eat for lunch.” ”

Cen Yuyan knew that old Mrs. Cen definitely had something to say to her. She stood up and followed behind Old Mrs. Cen.

The two of them came to the back garden.

“Old Mrs. Cen said directly, “Who told you to bring that fish here?” ”

Cen Yuyan was stunned. “What fish?”

Old Mrs. Cen knocked her walking stick loudly. “It’s that song Chenyu! She’s the one who sunk the fish. I think it’s more like an ugly fish!”
