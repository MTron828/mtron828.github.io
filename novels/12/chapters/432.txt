Translator: 549690339

“This time, Feng Qianhua deliberately did not address old lady Lin as Aunt Lin. ”

It was to let ye Shu misunderstand.

She had to let ye Shu think that she was now the wife of Lin Jincheng and that Old Lady Lin was her mother-in-law.

She could not let ye Shu find Lin Jincheng!

No!

She could not let everything that she had worked so hard for all these years go down the drain.

The position of the matriarch of the Lin family was hers.

Lin Jin city was also hers.

She would never allow anyone to take away the position that belonged to her!

“Ye Shu, that Shameless B * tch, she would not have a good ending. ”

Feng Qianhua’s eyes were filled with viciousness as she and Feng Xianxian supported Old Lady Lin on her left and right as they walked towards the male dormitory.

Ye Shu retracted her gaze and was momentarily absent-minded.

She did not expect to meet them at Beijing University.

Even more so.

She was a mistress.

How could she be a mistress?

Ye Shu stumbled back a few steps.

“Ye Zao held ye Shu and looked at her. “Mom, What’s Wrong?” ”

“I’m fine.”Ye Shu shook her head. “It’s just that the sun is too bright and the heat is a little uncomfortable.”

“Ye Zhuo could tell that ye Shu had something on her mind, but he did not ask much. He held the suitcase with one hand and supported ye Shu with the other as they walked forward. ”

Ye Shu tried her best not to think about the past.

Today was the day she sent ye Zhuo to school.

She did not allow herself to think about those unpleasant things.

Ye Zhuo’s dormitory was on the fifth floor.

There was no elevator.

“Ye Shu was about to say that she would help ye Zhuo carry the suitcase when a handsome, sunny boy walked over. “Junior, which floor do you live on? I’ll send you.” ”

“No need.”Ye Zao refused with a smile. “I can do it myself.”

“Thus, the boy saw ye Zao carry the large suitcase with one hand and put it on his left shoulder. His other hand naturally hooked onto ye Shu’s arm. “Mom, let’s go up.” ”

The whole process was so handsome that the boy was dumbfounded.

He had wanted to be a hero to save the damsel in distress.

He didn’t expect her to be so amazing.

Even ye Shu was shocked!

...

“On the other side, Feng Qianhua, her mother, and Old Mrs. Lin quickly arrived at the male dormitory where Lin Ze was. ”

It was the beginning of the school season.

There were many parents who came to send their children to school in the male dormitory.

“The conditions of the dormitory at Beijing University were very good. Compared to other universities, it could be considered luxurious. The four-person dormitory had a living room at the entrance and a four-person bedroom inside. There was a separate bathroom in the bedroom. ”

“At this moment, Lin Ze was making the bed on the top bunk. ” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“The two bodyguards of the Lin family stood at the side, listening to Lin Ze’s instructions at any time. ”

The other three boys in the dormitory looked curiously at Lin Ze.

They sighed in their hearts.

Beijing was Beijing!

There were too many rich people. This was the first time they had seen someone bring bodyguards to school.

“Feng Qianhua walked to Lin Ze’s bed. “Ah Ze, let me do it!” ”

“No need.”Lin Ze rejected her flatly.

“Feng Qianhua was not embarrassed and continued, “Ah Ze, have you prepared your toiletries? Is there anything missing? If there is, let Xiao Liu buy it for you.” ”

“No.”

“At this moment, Feng Qianhua seemed to remember something and continued, “Xiao Liu, I have prepared gifts for everyone. They are in the car. Please go downstairs and get them.” ”

“Okay.”Xiao Liu walked out of the door.

Old Mrs. Lin looked around the dormitory.

“She was used to living in a luxurious manor, so she naturally did not like a pigeon cage like the dormitory. If it was not necessary to stay during military training, she would not let Lin ze live in such a place. ”

“Not long after, Xiao Liu came up with three bags of luxury watches in her hands. ”

“Feng Qianhua took the bags and walked to the other three roommates. “Hello, I’m Lin Ze’s aunt. From now on, I’ll leave Ah Ze to take care of our Ah Ze. This is my gift to you.” ”

“The three of them looked at each other. One of them walked up and politely refused, “Thank you, aunt. I appreciate your kindness, but we can’t accept these things.” ”

It was the first time they had met Lin Ze’s family. How could they accept such an expensive gift?

These three boys were not people who did not know what was good for them!

“Feng Qianhua smiled and said, “We’ve already bought them. Just accept them. They are not expensive things.” ”

This was not expensive?

The three of them were stunned.

“This brand of watches had a minimum unit price of more than 50,000 yuan. Moreover, this was the latest model! ”
