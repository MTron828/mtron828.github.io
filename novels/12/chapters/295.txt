“[ he’s here, he’s Here! The Big Boss is here with the Peerless Beauty! ] ”

[ today is also the day that the big boss loves leaf. ]

[ worship the Big Boss! ]

“[ strange, why does the Big Boss Never Say Anything? ] ”

“[ say something, Big Boss ] ”

“Account: [ the heaven-toppling purple-gold hammer 1225, presents the peerless beauty * 11! ] ”

“[ F * ck! F * ck! Hammer bro, F * ck! Take down the first rank! ] ”

“Account: [ That Dog, gave out 12 Peerless Beauties! ] ”

[ dog bro is also awesome! ]

[ what’s going on today? Is it a fight between Immortals? ]

“[ the first rank, second rank, and third rank are fighting! Come and watch! ] ”

[ there’s a good show to watch! ]

“[ go, Brother Dog! Go, Hammer Bro! Go, Big Brother! ] ”

“Cen Shaoqing blocked the bullet screen, but he could still see the bullet screen of the gift. ”

“When he saw this scene, he frowned slightly, clicked on the screen, and continued to send gifts. ”

He had been in a high position for a long time.

He had to do his best no matter what.

He would never allow anyone to surpass him.

It was the same for gifts.

“[ account: Miao Yin user 202106080126, sending out a peerless beauty * 100! ] ”

100?

The bullet screen exploded.

Everyone thought they were seeing things.

“[ the boss is mad! He sent out 100 items for 50,000 each. I’m not good at Math. Can anyone answer how much 100 items cost? ] ”

[5 million! ]

“[[ covering my face and crying ] mom, I’ve grown stronger! 5 million flew past me just now. ] ”

[ F * ck! Five million! This big shot on the list must have a gold mine! ]

“[ I just took a look. The first person on the list is really a die-hard fan of Yezi. Miao Yin, who just registered in June, gave out gifts worth more than 20 million, all for Yezi! ]! [ and, the only person he pays attention to is Yezi. ] ”

[ I’ve fallen in love. ]

[ I want to have such a big shot too. ]

“Hammer bro, Doggie Bro, don’t be afraid, keep up ”

I Can’t afford it! I Can’t afford it! My Monthly Allowance is only around two million. I’ve spent almost all of it this month

I only have 1.8 million

Are you sure you want to use the word ‘only’

“[ F * ck! F * ck! A person with a monthly salary of 3,000 shed tears of poverty [ dog head -RSB- . ] ”

[ the world of rich people is unimaginable... ]

Ye Zao raised her eyebrows slightly and looked at the bullet screen.

To be honest.

She was also quite curious about this guy on the first rank.

He had given her a gift worth more than 20 million yuan.

He was indeed quite rich.

“At this moment, Ye Shu’s voice came from outside the door, “Zao Zao, come out quickly! Your classmate is Here!” ”

Classmate?

Could it be Zhao Pingting.

“Ye Zhuozao had just finished playing a game. “Sorry, Dear Babies. We have guests today. We’ll see you tomorrow.” ”

Baby?

Did Ye Zhuozao just call him baby?

When he heard this sentence.

“On the other end of the screen, Cen Shaoqing’s old face turned red, and his hand that was holding the Buddha beads paused. ”

“After a long while, he finally snapped out of his daze from calling him ‘baby’, and the corners of his mouth curled up slightly. ”

“It just so happened that Zhou Xiang came to deliver some fruits to Cen Shaoqing. When he saw that the wooden figure at home was actually smiling, he asked curiously, “Shaoqing, what are you smiling about?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing was stunned for a moment before he immediately regained his ice-cold face and continued counting the Buddhist beads. “No, you’re mistaken.” ”

“From the way he looked, it seemed like the person who was snickering just now was really not him. ”

Was he seeing things?

Zhou Xiang frowned. “Am I seeing things?”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “It’s your eyes that are seeing things.”

Zhou Xiang thought about it. This wooden son of hers had always been very reserved since he was young and did not like to laugh.

“She remembered that when Cen Shaoqing was five years old, in order to make him laugh, Zhou Xiang had deliberately pretended to be ugly for him to see. ”

“In the end, the person directly said, “Mom, are you an idiot?” ”

“From then on, Zhou Xiang did not want to make Cen Shaoqing laugh anymore. ”

“Cen Shaoqing did not like to laugh when he was young, and he did not like to laugh even more when he grew up. He had the same expression all year round and his face was tense. ”

He looked like a wooden man.

“Perhaps, her eyes were really playing tricks on her just now. ”

Zhou Xiang placed the fruits on the table. “The weather has been hot recently. Eat more fruits.”

“”I’m not eating. Mom, please take them away.” ”

“”It’s good for your body to eat more fruits.”Zhou Xiang continued, “This is the lotus mist that was just flown in. And this peach is also very good. You can eat two of them in one go!”! “Oh right, get someone to light up this peach bun and send it to sear sear!” ”

“As Zhou Xiang spoke, she walked downstairs. ”

“After Zhou Xiang left, Cen Shaoqing picked up a white peach and took a bite. ”
