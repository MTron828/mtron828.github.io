“As long as she was with Bai Jingshu, she would have a chance to meet ye Han. ”

“In front of the old man, Bai Jingshu couldn’t say anything more. Just as she was about to decline tactfully, old master bai beside her spoke up, “Little girl Mo, you’re such a child. The young couple is in a passionate relationship, so why are you joining in on the fun? If you’re bored, go find one too.” ”

“Bai Mo immediately grabbed elder Bai’s other arm. “Grandfather, I haven’t seen my sister for a long time. I miss her!” ”

“”Your sister isn’t alone now. You Child, why don’t You Know Your Limits?”Elder Bai retorted. ”

“Bai Mo continued, “Grandfather, please let me spend more time with my sister!” ”

“Bai Mo was all smiles, but in her heart, she had already cursed elder Bai a thousand times. ”

“In her opinion, Old Master Bai was biased and wanted to give Bai Jingshu the best of everything. What about her? She didn’t even have the right to accompany Bai Jingshu. ”

How could there be such a grandfather in this world?

“Old Master Bai ignored Bai Mo and turned to look at Bai Jingshu. He smiled and said, “Jingshu, you must be tired from the long journey. Go back and rest.” ” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“”Yes, grandfather.”Bai Jingshu nodded and walked inside. ”

“Bai Mo had just caught up with Bai Jingshu when Old Master Bai spoke again. “Little girl Mo, Don’t Disturb your sister. Let her rest well.” ”

“OH.”Bai Mo nodded.

“After saying that, old master Bai looked at Bai Mo and continued, “By the way, what has your father been busy with recently?” ”

“Bai Mo continued, “My father has been doing light quantum research recently.” ”

“Hearing this, elder Bai frowned slightly. “Go back and make your father worry less. Don’t keep thinking about nonsense. He’s not a child anymore. He should know very well what age he should be at and what age he should be doing!” ”

“”Got it.”Bai Mo nodded, but she felt a little uncomfortable in her heart. ”

“It was elder Bai’s fault for being biased, but it was also his father’s fault for not living up to expectations. ”

“As long as her father could live up to expectations, he would not look down on her like this. ”

And she did not have to look at other people’s expressions everywhere.

“”Alright. You can go back first,”old master Bai said. ”

“Bai Mo had just arrived at the old residence. How could she be willing to go back so quickly? “Grandfather, I want to spend more time with my sister.” ”

“”Your sister is tired and needs to rest. You can come back tomorrow.”Old Master Bai continued, “Coincidentally, Xiao Lin is coming over tomorrow too.” ”

“Bai Mo frowned slightly. She was very unhappy, but she still had to put on a show. She smiled and said, “Okay, Grandpa.” ”

“Bai Mo felt that it was uninteresting, but she was chased away by Old Master Bai again. When she turned around, her face was full of resentment. ”

This biased person was always the most biased no matter what.

“Bai Jingshu had her own room in the old mansion. She also had her own personal servant, who was also her granddaughter, but she had nothing. ”

“It was fine if she had nothing. It was not easy for her to come to the old mansion, but she was still chased away by Old Master Bai. ”

Just you wait!

She had to become a superior person and make old master bai regret it.

So what if old master Bai liked Bai Jingshu?

“Bai Jingshu could only marry a lowly earthling for the rest of her life. She would follow the whims of the rooster and the whims of the dog. No matter what, she would always be superior to Bai Jingshu. ”

Bai Mo had just stepped out of the Bai family’s old residence when Bai Yuanyuan arrived.

“When she saw Bai Mo, Bai Yuanyuan immediately trotted over. “Momo!” ”

Bai Mo raised his head. “Yuanyuan.”

“Bai Yuanyuan asked curiously, “Why did you come out? Bai Jingshu didn’t come back?” ”

“”She’s back,”Bai Mo continued, “She’s resting inside!” ”

“Bai Yuanyuan continued, “Why are you...” ”

“Before Bai Yuanyuan could finish her sentence, Bai Mo cut her off. “She’s Grandpa’s precious granddaughter’s sweetheart. What am I? I’m not even a servant in the old mansion!” ”

“”Don’t be angry, Momo. It’s not worth it to be angry with such a person.”Bai Yuanyuan held onto Bai Mo’s arm and continued, “Bai Jingshu will never be as good as you!” ”

“After saying that, Bai Yuanyuan continued, “Lin Ze didn’t come?” ”

Could it be that elder Bai was unhappy with Lin Ze’s birth and chased him away?

“Thinking of this, Bai Yuanyuan’s brows twitched. ”

“If Bai Jingshu didn’t marry Lin ze, how would they be able to suppress Bai Jingshu in the future? ”

“Bai Mo continued, “Lin Ze is at the hotel and will come over tomorrow. Don’t worry, this old man really likes this future grandson-in-law!”At the end, Bai Mo’s eyes were filled with disdain. ”

Bai Yuanyuan also heaved a sigh of relief.

The two of them boarded the aircraft together.

When they returned home.

“Bai Mo’s mother, Liu Qing, immediately came forward to welcome them. “Mo Mo is back! What’s wrong? Did you see her?” ”
