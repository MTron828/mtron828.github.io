“Chapter 1389: 286: if he’s not afraid of losing face, What Am I afraid of? 2”

“However, Xie Wanqiu was not in a hurry. ”

There was still plenty of time in the future.

There would always be an opportunity in the future!

“At the thought of this, Xie wanqiu narrowed her eyes. ”

“”They don’t even care about you. Why do you care about them?”Zhou zuolong continued, “Both of them are unfilial!” ”

“”Forget it, forget it. Don’t bother with the children.”Xie wanqiu waved her hand. “It’s fine if they don’t care about me. It’s fine as long as they care about you. After all, you’re their biological father.” ”

Show filial piety to him?

Just Zhou Jinbei and Zhou Xiang?

“These two people, even if they gave him some alimony, he would chase after them to ask for it. ”

“As long as he did not speak, they would never take the initiative to give him alimony. ”

“Zhou Zuolong turned to look at Zheng Wanyin. “When you greeted your uncle, what did your uncle say?” ”

“Zheng Wanyin looked a little troubled. “Uncle, uncle, he...” ”

“What’s wrong with him?”Zhou Zuolong asked.

“Zheng wanyin continued, “Uncle ignored me. He probably didn’t see me!” ”

“”Ignored you?”Hearing this, Zhou Zuolong became even angrier. “This unfilial son, he actually dared to ignore you!” ”

“Zheng Wanyin was Zhou Jinbei’s biological niece, but what about Zhou Jinbei? ”

He actually ignored Zheng Wanyin. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“In this world, was there such an uncle? ”

“Zheng wanyin hurriedly explained, “No, no, Grandpa, don’t be angry. Uncle didn’t do it on purpose! He just didn’t see me.” ”

“Zhou zuolong asked again, “Where did you see him?” ”

“Hearing this, Xie Wanqiu immediately gave Zheng Wanyin a look. ”

“Zheng wanyin understood and continued, “I saw uncle outside the cafe. He seemed to be with cousin-in-law and gave her a very big pink diamond.” ”

Pink Diamond?

Who was he giving it to?

Ye Zhuo?

“Did Zhou Jinbei really know how to differentiate between east, south, west, and north? ”

Giving ye Zhuo a big pink diamond?

What did he give Zheng Wanyin?

“Are you sure you didn’t see wrongly?”Zhou Zuolong asked.

“”Look at what you’re saying.”Zheng wanyin smiled and said, “Can I still mistake my uncle?” ”

“Xie wanqiu continued, “Yinyin is already so old, she definitely won’t mistake him!” ”

Not Mistaken?

Zhou Zuolong was very angry now.

“”This is too much! This is too much!”Zhou Zuolong slammed the table and stood up. “This unfilial son, does he still think highly of me? !” ”

“Xie wanqiu smiled and continued, “Old Man, what’s wrong with you this time?” ”

“Zhou zuolong said, “This unfilial son, what did he give Yinyin?”He actually gave her a big pink diamond! Not to mention a big pink diamond, he did not even give Zheng Wanyin a broken diamond. ”

“Xie wanqiu continued, “Our yinyin doesn’t care about this.” ”

“Zheng Wanyin immediately nodded in agreement. “Grandma is right. I don’t care about this at all. Grandpa, we can’t hurt the harmony between you and uncle because of this.” ”

“Zhou Zuolong sighed. “How could I give birth to such an unfilial son? He can’t even differentiate between home and outside!”Zheng Wanyin was too sensible. She was so sensible that Zhou Zuolong’s heart ached. Even Zhou Jinbei had treated Zheng Wanyin this way, however, Zheng Wanyin still thought that she could not affect the harmony between him and Zhou Jinbei. ”

Harmony?

Was there still harmony between him and Zhou Jinbei?

“”If I had known that you would blame uncle, I would not have told you that I saw uncle on the street.”Zheng Wanyin blamed herself very much, then, she said, “Grandfather, actually, this is nothing. You and grandmother have always said that cousin sister-in-law ye Zhuo is not suitable for cousin brother. Actually, I feel that the two of them are quite a good match. Otherwise, uncle would not have given cousin sister-in-law ye Zhuo a pink diamond. Actually, this can be considered as a form of recognition.” ”

“”Recognition? What does Zhou Jinbei count as! As a grandfather, I haven’t even spoken yet. What right does Zhou Jinbei have to say recognition!” ”

Zhou Zuolong felt that his personality had been insulted.

“He was clearly the head of the Zhou family, but no one in the Zhou family listened to him. ”

“A son was not like a son, and a daughter was not like a daughter. ”

“Fortunately, he later married Xie Wanqiu and had a smart and filial granddaughter like Zheng Wanyin. Otherwise, when he got old and could not walk anymore, wouldn’t he be tortured to death by these two unfilial sons and daughters? ”

The last thing Zhou Zuolong did now was not to have a child of his own with Xie wanqiu when he was young.

“Actually, it was not that he did not want it, but that he did not have the ability to do so. ”

“Back then, when he was with Wu Lan, in order to completely gain Wu Lan’s trust, after he was left with a son and a daughter, he went for a vasectomy. ”

“Who knew that although he gained Wu Lan’s trust, he did not gain the trust of the Wu family. ”
