“After a long while, Amy finally reacted. “Miss Ye, can I take a photo with you?” ”

“Sure.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Amy handed the phone to Xiao Li. “Amy, take a photo with us.” ”

Xiao Li took the phone and nodded with a smile. “Okay.”

“After the photo, Amy continued, “By the way, Miss Ye, elder Zhang and the others are already waiting for you in the back hall. You should hurry over!” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Hearing this, Xiao Li immediately became anxious and said, “I haven’t put on makeup yet!” ”

“Amy shook her head. “Miss Ye is naturally beautiful. If you put on makeup, you’ll look too white. If you put on makeup, you’ll look too red. This is just right! You Don’t need to put on makeup anymore!”The costume designer’s eyes were very sharp, amy had never seen a girl so stunning without makeup. It was as if she had her own beauty. ”

It was said that ten beauties had ten make-up.

“Obviously, this sentence could not be used on Ye Zao. ”

Xiao Li’s smile froze.

“Of course, she knew that ye Zao was just right. ”

But how could she make ye Zao Ugly without makeup?

“Soon, Xiao Li’s expression returned to normal. He smiled and said, “Miss Ye looks very good like this. If you put makeup on, you’ll look even better!” ”

“As he said that, he opened the makeup case. “Miss Ye, I’ve put makeup on many celebrities and socialites. Don’t worry, I’ll definitely let you see the most beautiful version of yourself.” ”

“”Thank you, but there’s no need,”ye Zao rejected flatly. “I also feel that this is just right. If the makeup is too thick, it will backfire.” ”

Xiao Li tried his best to keep a smile on his face.

Ye Zao turned around and walked outside.

“He was wearing a pair of crystal high heels. When he walked, his footsteps were thudding, and he looked extremely imposing. ”

He looked extremely like a queen who had returned from lust.

Just his back view alone was enough to make people scream.

“”Doggie, let’s go.” ”

“Xiao Bai was chatting with the attendant outside the door when he suddenly heard ye Zao’s voice. He looked up and instantly, his eyes turned into stars. “Wow! Big Zao! You look too, too, too good looking like this!” ”

The waiter was also stunned.

“Black was a dull color. The slightest carelessness would cause one’s skin to be darkened by the black. However, when ye Zao wore it, it only made people think of four words. ”

Ice Skin and jade bones.

Ye Zao patted Little White’s head. “You mean that Daddy doesn’t usually look good?”

“”No! That’s not what I mean!”Little White continued, “You usually look good too, but now you look even better! Otherwise, how can you be the most beautiful in the universe!” ”

“Ye Zhuo took out the small mirror that he carried with him and admired himself for a while. After a while, he sighed, “Why am I so good-looking!” ”

“Little white replied habitually, “What should I do if I’m so good-looking?” ” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The attendant was stunned.

“It was the first time she had seen a girl as good-looking as ye Zhuo, and it was also the first time she had seen a girl as narcissistic as ye Zhuo. ”

“However, even though she said narcissistic words, no one felt that she was out of place. ”

It was as if...

She was born this way.

“After a moment, the waiter reacted. “Miss Ye, elder Zhang is waiting for you in the back hall. Follow me.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and followed the waiter’s footsteps.

“Ye Zhuo and the others walked out of the corridor, but there was no one else. ”

Only the sound of footsteps could be heard.

...

On the other side.

Zhao Xueyin had successfully obtained the exact same starry night gown.

“She had a good foundation, and the makeup artist had a pair of skillful hands. After putting on this evening gown, she was so beautiful that she could not be described with words. ”

“Just as she finished putting on her lipstick, someone knocked on the door. ”

Annie jogged over to open the door. “Mr. Si.”

“The lawyer looked inside. “Miss Zhao, are you ready?” ”

“Hearing the lawyer’s voice, Zhao Xueyin frowned slightly. ”

She did not like to appear in public with the lawyer.

She was afraid of being misunderstood.

“In addition, the lawyer thought that she liked him, so every time she attended a banquet with the lawyer, Zhao Xueyin felt especially pressured. ”

“Annie continued, “Not yet, why don’t you wait a little longer?” ”

“Okay.”Si lui nodded slightly.

“Annie closed the door and came to Zhao Xueyin’s side. “Miss Zhao, Mr. Si is here.” ”

“Got it.”Zhao Xueyin’s expression was a little ugly.

“A moment later, Zhao Xueyin stood up from the chair. “I’m going to the washroom.” ”

“When she came to the washroom, Zhao Xueyin made a call. ”

“Dad.”

“A few minutes later, Zhao Xueyin came out of the washroom and walked straight to the door. “Big Brother Si.” ”
