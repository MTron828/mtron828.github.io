“Chapter 1303: 273: directly slapping her in the face, making Zheng Wanyin doubt her life! 2”

Translator: 549690339

“In the Cen family, Xie Wanqiu was not afraid of anyone. ”

Only she was a little afraid of Cen Shaoqing. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Because in the CEN family, Cen Shaoqing was the true pillar of support. ”

“Therefore, in front of Cen Shaoqing, she had to pretend to be very satisfied with Ye Zhuo. ”

She could not let Cen Shaoqing see anything!

“”Look, how did this child grow up! She is so beautiful!”Xie wanqiu said with a false heart. ”

Old Lady Cen was stunned.

“If she had not seen it with her own eyes, she would not believe that it was Xie Wanqiu. ”

The speed at which her expression changed was faster than flipping through a book.

Amazing!

“Zheng Wanyin looked up at ye Zhuo and exclaimed, “I’ve long heard from second aunt and a few cousins that my future cousin-in-law is as beautiful as a fairy. Seeing her today, I’m really ashamed. I’m in front of my future cousin-in-law.” ”

“Looking closer, there was not a single trace of plastic surgery on ye Zao’s face. ”

Zheng Wanyin was very curious.

Which plastic surgery hospital did ye Zao get plastic surgery from.

“Even if it was a traceless plastic surgery, it was impossible for it to only be done to this extent. ”

Could it be that ye Zao did not have any plastic surgery at all?

No.

It could not be.

How could a normal person be so beautiful to this extent.

Besides.

“In this world, how could there be any natural beauty. ”

“Those internet celebrities, who hasn’t had a knife on their face? ”

So.

Ye Zhuo must have had an operation.

She must have had a high-level operation.

“At present, there was no such plastic surgery technique in the country. ”

Unless.

Ye Zhuo had an operation abroad.

Yes.

Ye Zhuo must have had an operation abroad!

“If she had known earlier, she would have done the surgery abroad. ”

“Although her surgery was very successful, if one looked carefully, one could still see a small flaw. ”

“Therefore, she wore light makeup every day. ”

“However, ye Zao did not wear any makeup on his face, so one could not see anything. ”

It could simply be described as exquisite and peerless.

“Facing such a great beauty, even if she knew that the great beauty had plastic surgery, Zheng Wanyin was still very envious. ”

That kind of envy was subconscious.

She only regretted that she had not met ye Zao earlier.

“However, it was not too late. ”

“As long as she was not afraid of pain, she could be like ye Zao. ”

Ye Zao had shown her the door to a new world.

“In the past, she had thought that plastic surgery was scary. ”

“After seeing ye Zao, she instantly felt that plastic surgery was nothing. ”

“As long as she could exchange for beauty, what was a little pain? ”

“Thank you. You’re very beautiful too.”Ye Zao’s tone was clear and shallow.

Zheng Wanyin’s face showed a hint of shyness. “I can’t compare to cousin-in-law.”Ye Zao was so beautiful that she couldn’t even compare to one-thousandth of ye Zao.

Xie wanqiu glanced at Zheng Wanyin.

This girl was also heartless.

“It was obvious that this ye Zao was not someone who was easy to deal with. From the way he looked, it was clear that he treated Zheng Wanyin as an enemy. ”

“In fact, when dealing with people like ye Zao, all he had to do was put on a show. There was no need for him to be as sincere as Zheng Wanyin. ”

“Fortunately, she was still here. If she was not here, Zheng Wanyin would definitely be bullied to the point that not even her bones were left. ”

What a silly child. She did not know whether it was good or bad for her.

“Zhou xiang smiled and said, “Let’s not stand here anymore. Let’s sit down and talk. We are not outsiders!” ”

“”Yes, yes, yes.”Old Mrs. Cen followed. “Quickly sit down.” ”

The few of them sat down next to the sofa.

“Is it Hot?”Cen Shaoqing looked at Ye Zao. “Shall I help you take off the scarf?”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Actually, Ye Zao did not have the habit of wearing a scarf. Cen Shaoqing was the one who insisted on wearing this scarf for her. ”

It was minus 19 degrees Celsius in the capital today.

Cen Shaoqing helped ye Zao Take Off the scarf. Their positions were intimate.

Zheng Wanyin glanced at the two of them.

She felt that Cen Shaoqing had changed a lot.

The CEN Shaoqing from before could sit there for an entire day without saying a word.

He was as cold as an ice sculpture.

“Cen Shaoqing had actually learned to take the initiative to care for others now. In his deep black eyes, ye Zao’s figure was reflected. ”

Inexplicably.

Zheng Wanyin felt a little unworthy for Cen Shaoqing.

“If ye Zao was a real beauty, it would be fine. ”

But Ye Zao was an artificial one.

Who Was Cen Shaoqing?

The man standing at the top of the pyramid.

“In the past, he was an unmarried man. ”

“Now that he had become a normal man, he should be matched with the best girl. ”

However...

There weren’t many natural beauties anymore.

Weren’t they all artificial?

Even she had gone to the plastic surgery hospital several times.

“When she thought of this, Zheng Wanyin sighed softly. ”

“Very soon, a servant brought fruit. ”

“Although it was winter and December, the fruits that the servant brought were only available in spring and summer. ”
