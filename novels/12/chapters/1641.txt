“However, ye Zao brought back twenty tons of diamonds. ”

Twenty Tons of diamonds were equivalent to ten mines. How much energy did that save earth?

“After all, overexploitation was the most wasteful of energy and the most destructive to the environment! ” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Tang mi continued, “In addition, we also brought back many samples from Neptune. Many of them are the depleted energy sources on Earth.” ”

“After saying that, Tang Mi turned to Dr. Cara and asked with a smile, “Dr. Cara, do you want to test the authenticity of the Diamonds?” ”

Dr. Cara was stunned.

He was at a loss for words.

“The samples brought back from Neptune were the most precious ones. If China could extract some precious energy from the samples and use it to develop nuclear weapons, wouldn’t China be unparalleled in the world? ”

“Moreover, with the light-speed aircraft carrier, China could travel through the eight planets at will and do whatever experiments they wanted! ”

“In this way, China would definitely surpass country C and become the world’s largest country! ”

“The more Kara thought about it, the more uncomfortable she felt. She almost could not breathe. If she had known that ye Zao could really create a light-speed aircraft carrier, she would not have made an enemy out of ye Zao. She should have cooperated with ye Zao so that they could share the resources! ”

“But now, what was the use of regret? ”

“Not only would they not be able to share the resources with China, but they would also lose their main research base! ”

No!

No.

They could not let China take away the main research base of Country C.

“Dr. Kala continued, “Diamonds are not exclusive to Neptune. Other than Neptune, there are also diamond mines on Earth. “Does having a batch of diamonds mean that you have really landed on Neptune? “Unless, unless you send the samples you brought back from Neptune to the International Department for Quality Inspection!” ”

It would not be a loss to exchange the samples from Neptune for the base.

“If they could develop useful energy from those samples, then country C would be able to turn the tables. They might even be able to use the energy to build an aircraft carrier that was faster than the speed of light! ”

“The more Dr. Cara thought about it, the more excited he became. ”

“Ye Zao smiled faintly and looked at Dr. Cara, his red lips parted slightly. “The northern hemisphere of Neptune has our flag planted on it. Dr. Cara, why don’t you take your team and go to Neptune to take a look?” ”

“At this point, ye Zao seemed to have thought of something. He continued, “Oh, I’m sorry. I forgot that your country is currently unable to land on Neptune!” ”

The last sentence was no different from a taunt.

“Professor Cara’s face alternated between green and white, looking very ugly. ”

“In fact, the meaning behind ye Zao’s words was very simple. ”

How could a country that was unable to land on Neptune have the right to question China?

Professor Cara did not expect ye Zao to be so difficult to deal with.

“He thought that ye Zao would definitely take out the sample in order to prove his innocence, but he did not expect that not only did ye Zao not want to take out the sample, he even took the opportunity to mock him. ”

[ Ah Ah Ah! I’m finally satisfied! I just want to say that dad is cheating! ]

[ isn’t professor Cara the most aggressive person? Why isn’t he talking now? There’s also the BET agreement. Why aren’t they talking about the bet agreement now? ]

“[ it’s so funny. Now not only does Cara not dare to say anything, even those people on the bullet screen don’t dare to talk nonsense anymore! ] ”

[ it’s really good to vent my anger. I’m so happy to see Kara Like This! ]

[ China has finally risen! ]

“Seeing that Professor Kara did not say anything for a long time.., tang mi continued, “Professor Kara, do you want to test these diamonds or not? Actually, there are some differences between the diamonds on Neptune and those on Earth.”After all, the environment was different, the Diamonds on Neptune were of better quality and more transparent! ”

“Dr. Cara finally realized what was going on. He smiled stiffly and said, “There’s no need to test them.” ”

“There was no need to test the real diamonds and the fake diamonds. Under the illumination of the lights, they could be identified at a glance. ”

“If he went to test them now, he would only be embarrassing himself. ”

“Although he knew that these diamonds were real, Dr. Cara still did not believe that ye Zhuo had built an aircraft carrier that was faster than the speed of light and even landed on Neptune. ”

Everything was like a dream!

It was very unreal.

“Tang mi continued, “By the way, Dr. Kara, I wonder if you still remember the betting agreement that you signed with the other five countries and our Miss Ye.” ”

Betting Agreement.

Dr. Kara’s heart skipped a beat when he heard these words.

Was this topic finally brought up?

“Dr. Kara did not say anything, but Tang Mi continued, “I think Dr. Cara will not forget such a big matter. After all, you and the leaders of the other five countries are here today for this matter. “We have already drawn up the transfer agreement for the base. Dr. Cara and the leaders can just sign it.” ”
