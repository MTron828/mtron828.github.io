Li Wenru’s face turned green with rage and then paled with fear. She was so furious that she could no longer keep calm.

‘Ridiculous! This is truly ridiculous!’

“Aunty, calm down.” Li Qingyue wrapped her arm around Li Wenru’s arm and said in a gentle tone, “Based on what I know of my cousin-in-law, she is not a muddle-headed person who can’t tell what’s right and wrong. I’m sure that she has her own reasons for commissioning Ms. Ye. Perhaps, Ms. Ye really has the capability to cure Yi Tao?”

Li Wenru suppressed the rage in her heart with great effort. “Has the capability? Who in Yunjing Province doesn’t know that the fake daughter of the Mu family is an illiterate deadbeat? If she is to be labeled as ‘capable’, then anything is possible in this world! I think that Chen Qiaoye is trying to kill Tao Tao!”

“Aunty...” Li Qingyue continued, “One man’s words can influence others into thinking badly about someone else. I believe that it’s possible we might have misunderstood Ms. Ye. I think that Ms. Ye might not be as bad as she was claimed to be in the rumors.”

Li Wenru looked toward Li Qingyue helplessly. “You’re too naive, Qingyue! You actually believe that a deadbeat is capable of practicing the art of medicine. If Ye Zhuo is really a miracle doctor, her reputation in Yunjing Province won’t be this awful! Everyone has eyes. If she is truly that impressive, how could anyone have the audacity to slander her?”

A deadbeat would always be a deadbeat. Regardless of how she packaged herself, she would never be a genius.

Upon hearing that, Li Qingyue furrowed her brows. “Aunty, what you said seems to make a little sense… After all, the general public’s perception is always perceived to be unclouded.”

Before her voice died away, Li Qingyue changed the topic of conversation by saying, “However... I heard from my cousin-in-law that Ms. Ye was introduced to her by her second uncle. They’re a family, so my cousin-in-law’s second uncle wouldn’t intentionally harm her. Aunty, let’s not complicate the matter too much. What if there’s a favorable turn of events and a miracle is to appear? What if Ms. Ye managed to cure cousin for real?”

Not only did Li Qingyue’s remark fail to console Li Wenru, but on the contrary, it infuriated Li Wenru even more.

Chen Qianye’s second uncle was Chen Dafeng. Chen Dafeng was not a simple person, but he graduated from a renowned medical university and was very skilled in pharmacology. The traditional Chinese medicine dispensary that Chen Dafeng’s family ran had already been passed down for close to a century. So, how could a person like this introduce a deadbeat to treat Yi Tao’s illness?

Any person with discerning eyes could see what was happening at one glance! It was obviously because Chen Dafeng and Chen Qiaoye coveted the Yi family’s inheritance. They wanted to kill Yi Tao and then go for the Yi family’s inheritance! Shameless!

Both the uncle and niece were truly shameless!

The more Li Wenru thought about it, the more furious she became. She wished that she could choke Chen Qiaoye to death right away. “They’re doing this to kill Tao Tao so they can usurp our Yi family’s inheritance!”

“Huh?” Li Qingyue drew in a cold breath, and her face turned paler. “It, it can’t be, right….”

Li Qingyue noticed the change in Li Wenru’s expression. She quickly said, “Aunty, let’s not indulge in blind conjectures anymore. It’s possible that she and her uncle were deceived by Ye Zhuo. I can personally guarantee you that my cousin-in-law is not the kind of person who plots against her husband. She loves Yi Tao very much. Otherwise, Yi Tao wouldn’t have insisted on marrying her by threatening to commit suicide back in those years.”

As soon as the statement was made, it immediately brought up some bad memories in Li Wenru’s mind.

Chen Qiaoye came from a common family, and her parents were just ordinary wage earners.?It was completely out of her league to marry into the Yi family. Had it not been Yi Tao who insisted on marrying her by threatening to commit suicide, how could she possibly allow Chen Qiaoye to marry into the family?

Li Wenru was not very fond of Chen Qiaoye. The truth had proven that she had not misjudged her because Chen Qiaoye was precisely the b*tch that Li Wenru knew she was! She was actually trying to kill her son now!

Lin Wenru stood up swiftly with a ‘whoosh’ and stormed toward the bedroom in a rage.

“Aunty!” Li Qingyue immediately caught up to Li Wenru.

In the room, Ye Zhuo had already left, leaving only Chen Qiaoye, who was giving Yi Tao a sponge bath.

The towel was soaked in medicinal herbs, so there was the faint scent of medicinal herbs lingering in the air.

“B*tch!” Li Wenru walked over and delivered a slap to Chen Qiaoye’s face.

“Mom!” Chen Qiaoye’s was face turned sideways from the brute force of the slap. Then, she turned back and looked at Li Wenru incredulously.

“B*tch! Wicked woman!” Li Wenru said in rage, “You don’t deserve to call me mom! Our Tao Tao must really be blind to fall for a wicked woman like you!”

“Mom, what’s going on?” Chen Qiaoye covered her face while her entire body was trembling.

She knew that her mother-in-law despised her all this time. However, the woman had never hit her before.

Li Qingyue tapped on Li Wenru’s back to soothe her. She took a step forward and said in a gentle tone, “Cousin-in-law, please don’t be mad at aunty for being so furious. Do you know who Ms. Ye is?”

“What do you mean?” Chen Qiaoye was stunned for a moment.

“Ms. Ye was the eldest daughter of the Mu family in the past. You should be aware of the matters with regards to the eldest daughter of the Mu family.” Li Qingyue then continued, “Even the skilled doctors from local and foreign countries couldn’t cure my cousin’s illness. Ms. Ye is only 18 years old this year… is she really capable of curing my cousin? Moreover, I heard that… Ms. Ye is even illiterate!”

Chen Qiaoye continued to speak, “Mom, Qingyue, you’ve misunderstood Ms. Ye! Ms. Ye is a very gifted person. This is the prescription written by her for Yi Tao. Look at her penmanship! Do you think this is written by an illiterate?”

It was a very pleasant-looking Lu-style Chinese calligraphy writing that was written in forceful, vigorous strokes with adequate profoundness.

Li Qingyue narrowed her eyes. She noticed that none of the medicines listed in the prescription was effective in eradicating parasites but only slightly effective in nourishing one’s body and vitality.

It seemed that all of this hype about curing him was just a false alarm. For a second, she was truly under the assumption that the deadbeat Ye Zhuo was so capable.

Li Wenru tore up the prescription passed to her by Chen Qiaoye instantly; she pointed at Chen Qiaoye and said, “I won’t give you the permission to feed my son some nonsense medicine! Please get out and leave our Yi family now!”

Chen Qiaoye’s entire body was shivering. “Mom! You’re going to end Yi Tao’s only way to live!”

“Shut up, b*tch!” Li Wenru delivered another slap. “Do you think that I’m unaware of your filthy scheme with Chen Dafeng? You want to kill Tao Tao so you can usurp our Yi family’s inheritance! Let me tell you this... as long as I’m here, you will never get it! You will never possibly prevail!”

“No… I don’t….” Tears streamed down Chen Qiaoye’s face. “I hope that Yi Tao can get well soon more than anyone else. If I can, I’d give up my life in exchange for Yi Tao’s life.”

It was not a lie.

She had been married to Yi Tao for many years, and their relationship had always been inseparable.

Li Qingyue stood on the side. “I can understand your feeling, cousin-in-law, and I’m also aware that there’s a saying that one will try anything in a desperate situation. Ms. Ye’s bad reputation is clearly out there, so how can you expect us to trust her?”

“Get out! Get out now!” Li Wenru pointed at the door and instructed.

“Cough cough cough!” Meanwhile, Yi Tao, who was lying on the bed, suddenly woke up. He sat upright and vomited a huge gulp of fresh blood. The bright red blood stained the white blanket.

“Tao Tao!”

“Yi Tao!”

Li Wenru and Chen Qiaoye pounced toward him simultaneously.

“Qiaoye…” Yi Tao held Chen Qiaoye’s hand and said weakly, “I’m so, so sorry that I couldn’t protect you….”

Chen Qiaoye shook her head while crying. “I’m fine, I’m fine….”

Upon saying that, Yi Tao looked toward Li Wenru. “Mom, I’m begging you not to make things difficult for Qiaoye. You doing this is making me feel… really sad in my heart….”

Li Wenru wiped away her tears. “Silly child! This b*tch is trying to get you killed! Why are you still defending her!?”

Yi Tao spoke with great difficulty, “Mom, you’ve misunderstood Qiaoye. Qiaoye is not that kind of person! There’s no need for all of you to let a dying man like me affect the family’s good relationship. Mom, I hope that when I’m gone, you will treat Qiaoye like she is your own daughter….”

“You won’t die! My silly child, you won’t die!” Li Wenru bawled aloud.

Yi Tao continued, “I know my body well and that I can’t escape death regardless. Just let me give Ms. Ye’s prescription a try; otherwise, I won’t die in peace….”
