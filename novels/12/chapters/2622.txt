“Tomorrow, Li Da Long’s blind date would be visiting his house. That was why Li da long told Li hang not to go out if he had nothing to do. ”

“Li hang naturally knew what Li da long meant. He smiled and raised his head. “Dad, actually, as long as you and aunt fan are on the same page, it doesn’t matter whether I watch or not. The main thing is that you’re happy.” ”

“Li Hang’s words were really too heartwarming, causing Li da long to be endlessly moved. ”

“If it was someone else’s daughter, who would be as sensible as Li Hang? ”

“Li da long continued, “Hang Hang, you’re so sensible that you don’t even know what to say to dad. Don’t worry, your aunt fan is definitely not that kind of woman. She definitely won’t let you down.” ”

“”En.”Li hang nodded. “Dad, I believe in your judgment.” ”

Li Da long nodded as well.

“After a while, Li da long continued, “Right, how many of you are going out to pick green leaves later?” ”

“”Five or six,”Li hang replied. ”

“”There are boys, right?”Li Da Long asked. ”

Li hang nodded. “There are both boys and girls.”

“”That’s good. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be safe for you girls to go out.”Li da long continued, “Why don’t you ask your classmates to come over for dinner tonight? Dad will take you out to eat something delicious.” ”

“Li hang smiled and said, “No, Dad. I’ve already discussed where to eat.” ”

“”That’s fine too. When you have time, you must bring your classmates over as guests.” ”

“Okay.”Li hang nodded.

“After breakfast, Li Hang carried his bag and prepared to go out. ”

“Seeing that she was carrying a bag, Li da long continued, “Hang, Don’t you bring anything else when you go out to pick Green?” ”

“Li hang instantly reacted and said with a smile, “There’s no need. I got someone else to bring it for me.” ”

“That’s good.”

Li Hang went downstairs and drove to the address that he had agreed to with Zhou Cui Hua.

“When she arrived, Zhou Cui Hua had already arrived. ”

“Zhou Cui Hua smiled and waved at Li Hang. “Hang hang, here.” ”

Li Hang walked over and sat down. “Mom.”

“After saying that, Li Hang looked around and asked in puzzlement, “Where’s uncle Wang?” ”

“Zhou cuihua said, “Your uncle Wang heard that you like drinking milk tea, so he went to buy milk tea for you.” ”

This indirectly showed how much boss Wang valued Li Hang.

Zhou Cuihua was also very happy.

“Li hang asked curiously, “Where’s his assistant?” ”

“Under normal circumstances, boss Wang did not lack assistants. ”

“Zhou cuihua said, “When your uncle Wang came out with me, he did not let outsiders follow him.” ”

“OH.”Li hang nodded.

“Zhou cuihua looked in the direction where boss Wang had left, but she didn’t see him. Then she said, “Hang Hang, you have to seize this last chance.” ”

Li Hang continued to nod.

“Zhou cuihua said again, “Your uncle Wang really likes you. He even prepared a bedroom for you. “His son has his own business overseas. As long as your name appears in the Wang family’s household register, then everything in the Wang family will be yours.” ”

“The Wang family had a big business. As long as Li Hang was willing to agree, then Li hang would be an authentic white, rich, and beautiful woman. ”

“Li hang said, “Mom, why did you move in with him so quickly? If you do this, won’t uncle Wang think that you’re a very casual woman?” ”

The truly rich people paid a lot of attention to their morals.

Zhou Cuihua and boss Wang had known each other for less than a month.

It was indeed inappropriate for Zhou Cuihua to move to the Wang family in such a short period of time.

“”No.”Zhou cuihua continued, “If you can think of such a problem, why can’t I think of it? “Don’t worry, your uncle Wang isn’t that kind of person. Also, although I moved to your uncle Wang’s house, we didn’t live together.” ”

Li hang nodded. “I was just casually mentioning it. It’s good that you know what to do.”

“Zhou cuihua looked towards the door again and continued, “Your uncle Wang is a good person, and your grandmother Wang is easy to get along with. Hang Hang, you will definitely not regret coming to the Wang family. You will not have any future if you follow your father.” ”

What could Li da long give Li Hang?

A broken house and a broken car?

“Speaking up to this point, Zhou cuihua continued, “Yesterday, I had no intention to tell your uncle Wang that you like sports cars. I saw that he was already looking at sports cars today.” ”

The sports cars that Li Hang liked were all around eight digits in price. It was not something that Li Dalong could afford.

“Hearing this, Li Hang’s heart skipped a beat. He could not help but think of the night when he watched the musical. ”

“When she walked in the VIP exclusive passageway, those people looked at her with envy. ”

Li hang really liked that feeling.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m
