“Old Master Chen came here to ask for help, so he naturally couldn’t act like he was superior. ”

“”Then please wait a moment.”The butler continued, “I’ll go and pour you some tea.” ”

“Okay.”Old Master Chen nodded.

The Butler went to pour tea for Old Master Chen personally.

“Song Shiyu’s routine was to get up at six in the morning, run for a while, then take a shower and eat. ”

“At that moment, he was running back. ”

“”Boss.”Seeing him come over, his assistant immediately went over to greet him. ”

“Song Shiyu lowered his head and tidied his collar, then said, “What’s the matter?” ”

“The assistant continued, “Old Master Chen is here.” ”

Old Master Chen?

Song Shiyu frowned slightly. What was Old Master Chen doing here at such a time?

“Did he say what it is?”Song Shiyu continued to ask.

The assistant shook his head. “He didn’t say. But he mentioned that he had something important to discuss with you.”

“”Okay, I got it.” ”

Song Shiyu stepped into the room and turned his head. “Tell Old Master Chen that I’ll be right there.”

The assistant nodded. “Okay.”

“After song Shiyu entered the room, he began to wash up. ”

“About ten minutes later, song Shiyu arrived at the hall. ”

“”Shiyu!”Seeing song Shiyu, Old Master Chen was a little excited. ”

“Firstly, he really thought highly of this young man. ”

“Secondly, after all, Song Shiyu was about to become his grandson-in-law. ”

“On the way here, Old Master Chen thought a lot. ”

He felt that Chen Siyao was right.

“After all, he owed song Shiyu a favor. Although song Shiyu had been supporting the Chen family for so many years, if it weren’t for him back then, song Shiyu wouldn’t be the current song Shiyu. ”

A drop of kindness should be repaid with a gushing spring.

“Moreover, song Shiyu was a person who knew how to repay kindness. ”

“He and Chen Siyao were both people who had reached their age. Song Shiyu could marry anyone, so he might as well marry Chen Siyao. ”

“Chen Siyao wasn’t bad looking, and she was the only child of the Chen family. She had received the best education since she was young. ”

The combination of these two people was definitely the existence of a golden couple.

“In short, Old Master Chen was very optimistic about the two of them. ”

“”Old Chen.”Song Shiyu walked over, ”

“old Master Chen continued, “Shiyu, are you busy recently?” ”

“”I’m Alright.”Song Shiyu continued, “It’s more or less the same as usual.” ”

“Old Master Chen drank a mouthful of tea, he then said, “I see that you’ve lost a lot of weight recently. Shiyu, listen to me. Money isn’t something that can be earned. You should also pay attention to rest and combine work and rest. You Can’t just think about earning money.” ”

Song Shiyu was a person who didn’t have any hobbies. If one had to say that he had any hobbies...

That would be earning money!

“Usually, song Shiyu was either earning money or on the way to earning money. ”

Song Shiyu sat opposite Old Master Chen. “Thank you for your concern. I will.”

“Old Master Chen stroked his beard and thought about the words he wanted to say. He then said, “Shiyu, how are your aunts and the others recently?” ”

“”They’re fine,”song Shiyu replied. ”

The aunt that old master Chen was talking about was not really related to song Shiyu. They were not even close.

Song Shiyu was a little confused. Why would old master Chen suddenly mention this ‘aunt’

“Old Master Chen continued, “When I saw her a while ago, she was still worried about your marriage. She said that when your grandmother left, you were the one she was worried about the most.” ”

“At this point, Old Master Chen paused. “Your aunt even said that she wanted to introduce you to someone. Did she do it in the end?” ”

“Song Shiyu actually did not like such a topic, but he still shook his head politely. “No.” ”

“Old Master Chen instantly had an idea. He continued, “Then have you found a girlfriend now?” ”

Old Master Chen’s sudden concern for him made him a little puzzled.

“”Not yet,”song Shiyu said. ”

“Old Master Chen continued, “I remember that you’re about thirty years younger this year, right?” ”

“En.”Song Shiyu nodded.

“Old Master Chen smiled and said, “I remember that Yaoyao is two years younger than you. Sigh, that child is just like you! Up until now, she’s still alone. Not being able to see that child get married in her lifetime, I really feel uncomfortable.” ”

“At this point.., old Master Chen continued, “Especially you, Shiyu. Although you’re not my biological grandson, in My Eyes, you’re no different from my biological grandson. When a man reaches the age of thirty, he should still be able to consider the important matters of his life.” ”

“Mm.”Song Shiyu nodded. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Then when are you going to consider finding one?”Old Master Chen asked immediately.

“”No Rush,”song Shiyu answered. ”

“”No Rush?”Grandpa Chen looked at Song Shiyu. “You’re already so old, why aren’t you in a Rush?” ”
