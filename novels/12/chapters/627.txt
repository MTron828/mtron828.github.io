“Yes.”

“Zhou xiang continued, “I saw that Aunt Lin’s complexion did not look too good. Did you have an argument with her?” ”

“Yes.”

“Zhou Xiang poured a cup of tea for Old Lady Cen, “Mom, Aunt Lin is already so old. Why do you have to make things difficult for her? Besides, the two of you have been friends for so many years! Now that Zhuluo and Shaoqing are still together, won’t you hurt the harmony between the two families?” ”

Zhou Xiang was a reasonable person who advocated peace.

“For so many years, Zhou Xiang had never blushed with anyone. ”

“Moreover, the Lin and CEN families were about to get closer and closer. It was not a wise move to quarrel at this time. ”

Old Mrs. Cen slammed the table and stood up. “Xiang Xiang! Do you know what that old fool Bai Tian said just now?”

“Old fool Bai Tian?”Zhou Xiang was stunned.

“Old Mrs. Cen said, “It’s Zhao fangyue!” ”

“Zhou Xiang frowned slightly. “Mom, how can you say that about Aunt Lin! No wonder I saw her face so ugly outside just now!” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen frowned and said, “That old fool Bai Tian ran over and said that Yezi wasn’t good enough for Shaoqing. She even said that she wanted to marry Feng Xianxian to Shaoqing and said a lot of bad things about Yezi...” ”

“”What?”Zhou Xiang was immediately enraged, “How can she say that? ! Is she still Yezi’s grandmother? ! This is really too much! Mom, why didn’t you call me back just now? ! If I were at home, I would definitely have a good argument with her! She actually came over to sow discord! She bullied my daughter-in-law! Mom, you did the right thing! When dealing with someone like her, you shouldn’t treat her well! “Otherwise, she would think that our Cen family’s daughter-in-law is so easy to bully!” ”

Zhou Xiang was also very angry!

“She thought that this was just a conflict between the two old ladies, but she did not expect that it would involve ye Zhuo. ”

Too Much!

Old Lady Lin was really too much!

“Ye Zhuo was such a good child, how did he end up with such a grandmother? ”

“Zhou Xiang continued, “Mom, did you scold her just now?” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen said, “I scolded her! Of course I scolded her! Not only did I scold her, I even chased her out!” ”

“Well done!”Zhou Xiang gave old Mrs. Cen a thumbs up.

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “I regret not scratching her face right now! I’m So Angry!” ”

“Zhou Xiang said with some worry, “Mom, do you think that ye Zao will be bullied in the Lin Family?” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen replied, “Don’t worry! Yezi is not a pushover! If she dares to provoke Yezi, Yezi will definitely not be polite to her!” ”

“Even though that was what she said, Old Mrs. Cen was still a little worried about ye Zhonghua. She picked up her tablet and opened wechat to send a video to ye Zhonghua. ”

“Soon, the call was connected. Ye Zhonghua’s face appeared on the screen with a white wireless earpiece on his ear. ”

“Grandma Cen.”

“Seeing ye Zao, old Mrs. Cen laughed so hard that she couldn’t even see her eyes. It was as if she wasn’t the one who was angry and scolding the old lady earlier. “Yezi, what are you doing?” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “I have a small matter at the hospital.” ”

The hospital?

“Old Mrs. Cen was extremely worried when she heard that. “Yezi, are you feeling unwell? Or did that old fool and Sweet Bully You?” ”

“”No, I’m fine. Grandma Cen, you don’t have to worry. I came to the hospital for other matters.”Speaking up to this point, Ye Zhuo asked with some doubt, “Who is that old fool Bai Tian?” ”

“It’s that deaf and blind grandma of yours!”

“Hearing this, Ye Zhuo was overjoyed. “Your description is spot-on!” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “Right? You also think that she’s deaf and blind, right?” ”

“After saying that, old Mrs. Cen continued, “Did that old fool Bully You?” ”

Ye Zao smiled slightly. “Do I look like the kind of person who is easy to bully?”

“As long as ye Zao’s identity was a little ordinary, he would be bullied. ”

“After all, Old Mrs. Cen’s methods were endless. First, she changed her name, and then she said that they were related... ”

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “If she dares to bully you, tell me. I’ll go and scratch that old fool’s face! “Yezi, you mustn’t fight with her. If you fight directly, you’ll be labeled as unfilial. People talk, and when the time comes, the White will be labeled as black! “If I fight, it’s different. I’m of the same generation as her! “If I fight with her, at most, it’ll be considered a fight! “Moreover, with that cowardly look of hers, she definitely can’t beat me!” ”

“Ye Zhuo suddenly felt a warmth in his heart. From old Mrs. Cen’s face, she thought of her grandmother from another world. “Grandma Cen, thank you.” ”
