Chapter 91: 074: strength slaps the face, stunning all four! 5

But now, when she looked at Mu Yourong again, she no longer had the initial feeling of amazement.

Everyone’s gazes were like knives, slicing at Mu Yourong’s body one by one.

Mu Yourong wanted nothing more than to immediately find a hole to hide in.

Why was she the one making a fool of herself?

The one making a fool of herself should be ye Zao!

But now, she could only bite the bullet and stand up, saying to ye Zao, “I’m sorry, I misunderstood you before. You didn’t cheat.”

Ye Zao smiled slightly, “Senior is a person in the circle. You should know what I will face once I am labeled as a cheat? I hope that senior can investigate the matter clearly before coming across it again and come to a conclusion. Don’t follow the crowd... . . . .”

Mu Yourong bit her lips tightly. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Her heart was filled with unwillingness!

The person who lost tonight should be ye Zao!

It was ye Zao who had stolen her things!

Du Ruo could not bear to listen any longer. She felt that ye Zao was taking an inch and taking a mile.

Wasn’t it just a misunderstanding?

Was there a need for ye Zao to bite Mu Yourong and not let go?

“It was just a misunderstanding. Rong Rong has already apologized to you. Miss YC, you should still be a little kinder.”

Ye Zao tilted his head slightly, his eyes filled with coldness. “I’ve only been stabbed once, and my blood hasn’t even been wiped clean yet, and you’re telling me to be kinder? Director du, don’t try to persuade others to be kinder before they suffer.”

[ Ah Ah Ah! Ye Zi is so cool! ]

[ ye Zi is absolutely right. The cheating incident was caused by My Rong. Those who said that Ye Zi was ugly were also MY Rong’s team! ]! At that time, Ye Zi had faced so many attacks and smears. If it had been anyone else, they might not have been able to persevere. You haven’t experienced our ye Zi’s pain, so why are you trying to convince us ye Zi to be kind? ! I think this Bullsh * t director is also a scheming B * tch

[ frantically punching a time card for ye Zao! ]

[ I have to say, this sentence is really quite satisfying! Lu has become a fan. ]

[ what kind of magical baby is This! ]

Du Ruo’s face turned pale.

She had originally thought that after saying this sentence, public opinion would definitely favor her and Mu Yourong.

She had not expected that ye Zao would use just one sentence to make the situation collapse!

The party continued.

However, the main character had already changed from Mu Yourong to Ye Zao.

Mu Yourong had always been an existence that the stars worshipped, but she had suddenly changed from a noble Phoenix to a pheasant that no one cared about, making it impossible for her to adapt.

It was as if no matter where she stood, she could see the mocking gazes of everyone.

She had originally thought that tonight, she would be able to make fifth master Cen’s eyes light up and fall in love with her.

But she did not expect that in the end, everything would be snatched away by Ye Zao.

Wait!

She would definitely avenge her past humiliation!

Looking at ye Zao over there, a sinister light surfaced in Mu Yourong’s eyes.

Ye Zao was currently chatting with the other female streamers over there.

Originally, everyone thought that since ye Zao was so beautiful and his go skills were so good, he would definitely be the same as Mu Yourong and be extremely cold and aloof.

They did not expect ye Zao to be so easy to get along with.

Mu Yourong simply could not be compared to her.

“Yezi, where did you buy this evening gown? It’s really beautiful! It’s a private design, right?”

Ye Zao said, “Not only is this evening gown of mine beautiful in style, it also has a very special function.”

“What function?”

Ye Zao continued, “It can adjust the temperature.”

“Adjust the temperature?”Everyone looked incredulous.

Ye Zao nodded slightly and started to tell everyone about the dress that could adjust the temperature.

Everyone could not believe that there was such a heaven-defying dress that could adjust the temperature in this world.

Seeing that everyone did not believe it, ye Zao lifted the hem of the dress, revealing a fair and beautiful leg. “You’ll know when you touch this fabric.”

Everyone touched the hem of his dress suspiciously.

The venue of the party was half-open.

It was December in Beijing, and the weather was already very cold.

The female streamers were all wearing thin gowns. They were all freezing, but ye Zao’s dress was emitting a steady stream of heat.

It was especially warm.

“Yezi, can I Touch Your Hand?”A long-haired female streamer looked carefully at ye Zao.

“Sure.”Ye Zao nodded.

The long-haired female streamer held ye Zao’s hand.

Her hand was very warm.

Compared to her, it was like an ice and a fire.

They were both wearing thin gowns. They were all frozen like dogs, but ye Zao’s hand was so warm. Only then did the streamers believe that what ye Zao said was true.

Her gowns could really adjust the temperature!

This invention was simply a blessing for female streamers who needed to walk the red carpet and exit the country for many years!

“Ye, where did you buy this gowns?”

“I want to buy one!”
