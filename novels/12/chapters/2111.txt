“Chapter 2112: 436: all these years, he had been living in a lie! 2”

Ye Zhuo brought him to Siyu Pavilion.

Siyu Pavilion was very big.

“Ye Han lived on the first floor, and Ye Zhuo lived on the third floor. ”

“When Ye Han was still there, she lived on the second floor. ”

“Now That Ye Lan had betrayed him, her room had also become the study and guest room area. ”

“Ye Zhuo’s room was very big. In the 26-square-meter bedroom, a laboratory was isolated with nanomaterials. ”

“When he pushed open the door of the laboratory, he could smell a pungent smell. ”

Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly. “Why is there a laboratory in the bedroom?”

“Ye Zao said, “We have a lot of unexpected situations here. I often get woken up in the middle of the night. Sometimes, I can’t rush to the base in time, so I can only do experiments at home. “Not only my room, but also ye Han’s room.” ”

“OH.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“”Right, there’s a garden behind here.”Ye Zao pushed open the door behind him. “This is the ladder. We can go down from the ladder.” ”

Cen Shaoqing followed ye Zao’s footsteps.

The ladder was much faster than the elevator.

“After a few seconds, it stopped at the garden on the first floor. ”

“Different from the plants on Earth, a mushroom on earth could grow to the size of a palm at most. A mushroom in the s galaxy was comparable to a big tree. However, although the mushrooms here were not poisonous, no one used them because the nutrient content was too low, eating ten mushrooms was not even worth half a vial of nutrient solution. ”

“Not only were there mushrooms, there were also roses that were bigger than an umbrella. ”

“A gentle breeze blew, and one’s nose was filled with the strong smell of roses. ”

It was especially nice.

“Walking here, one could not help but think of the stories in fairy tales. ”

“After walking for a while, Ye Zhuo received a message from ye Han. He turned to look at CEN Shaoqing and said, “Ye Han is here. Shall we go back?” ”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

The two of them took the aerial ladder back.

“”Sister, here’s the Tracker.”Ye Han handed the tracker to Ye Zhuo. ”

This tracker was also invented by Ye Zhuo. It recorded all the road signs of the s galaxy as well as the planets with life. “...”

Ye Zhuo entered Cen Haifeng’s name and clicked on search.

“The next second, the screen displayed: ”

“Sorry, I can not provide you with this person’s address. ”

“Ye Zhuo narrowed his eyes slightly, clicked on the bottom left corner, logged into the administrator account, and entered Cen Haifeng’s name again. ”

It still did not work.

Cen Haifeng was after all the President of the General Alliance. It was normal that he could not easily track down his detailed address.

“Ye Zhuo narrowed his eyes slightly and turned his head to look at Cen Shaoqing, “Why don’t We Wait a little longer? Uncle has an anti-tracking device on him. We need to degaussing him from a distance before we can locate his exact address. In the next few days, I’ll first take you to understand the borders of Changyue and then to understand the general alliance on the spot.” ”

“Sure.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

Ye Zhuo made a script on the tracking device and started to operate it from a distance.

“Ye Han continued, “Sister, then I’ll go and arrange a guest room for Mr. Cen First.” ”

“”Okay.”Ye Zhuo thought for a moment, “Isn’t there an empty room in the room next to mine? Just arrange it there.” ”

“Okay.”

“After ye Han left, only ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing were left in the room. ”

Ye Zhuo set the tracker into an automatic program and took out an item from his backpack and handed it to CEN Shaoqing.

“What’s This?”Cen Shaoqing reached out to take it and asked curiously.

“”A human skin mask,”ye Zhuo explained. “Since the alliance has arranged for people to be by your side, they must know what you look like. “If you wear this, they won’t be able to discover you. “Then, this is our new identity in the S Galaxy.” ”

“Ye Zhuo had long announced her retirement. It was definitely not appropriate for her to appear in the public’s view at this time. Therefore, she had to wear the human skin mask. ”

“After saying this, Ye Zhuo handed a card to CEN Shaoqing. ”

“This is the ID card of the S Galaxy?”Cen Shaoqing took the card and asked.

“”Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “It doesn’t matter in Siyu Pavilion. Once you’re outside, you must put on the ID card and the human skin mask.” ”

“Okay.”

Ye Zhuo opened the human skin mask and taught Cen Shaoqing how to put it on his face.

“It was a very thin layer and did not feel strange at all when it stuck to his face. Most importantly, it was very natural. Not to mention human eyes, even a machine could not detect it. ”

“When Ye Han came back, the people who appeared in front of him were already two unfamiliar men and women. ”

“Although their appearances had become ordinary, the aura on their bodies was still there. ”

“”Sister, the room has been cleaned.” ” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and continued, “From now on, Call Me Miss Zhuo outside. He is Mr. Shao.” ”
