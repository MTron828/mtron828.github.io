Zhou Zuolong was really too angry!

“Zhou Jinbei, this unfilial son! ”

He challenged the authority of the head of the family again and again.

“If he didn’t do something, Zhou Jinbei would really think that he, the head of the family, was made of paper! ”

“”Old Man, you can’t say that!”Xie wanqiu held Zhou Zuolong’s hand, “The child is just a little late, you just have to wait a little longer! Why do you have to sever ties!” ”

“”Is he a little late?”Zhou zuolong said angrily, “He clearly doesn’t take me, his father, seriously! Wanqiu, you don’t have to plead for him anymore. Today, I have to teach him a lesson! Yinyin, immediately contact the reporters. Tell them that I have a big, shocking secret that touched the big shot Zhou Jinbei in China, and I want to expose it!” ”

“Grandpa...”Zheng Wanyin looked at Zhou Zuolong with some embarrassment.

“”Go quickly!”Zhou Zuolong said with a cold face, “Don’t you even listen to Me Now?” ”

“Hearing this, Zheng Wanyin could only contact the reporters. ”

“Xie rongle, who was at the side, was extremely anxious. ”

She came here this time to marry Zhou Jinbei.

But Zhou Zuolong wanted to break off relations with Zhou Jinbei and make Zhou Jinbei lose his reputation. Then what was the use of her marrying Zhou Jinbei?

What should she do now?

“Unfortunately, Xie rongle gave Xie wanqiu a few glances, but Xie Wanqiu did not seem to notice it. ”

“It was not easy for Xie wanqiu to go to the bathroom, so Xie Rongle followed her in. ”

“”Aunt,”Xie Rongle said with some reproach, “Why didn’t you stop Uncle Just Now! Do you really want uncle to publish the newspaper and sever his relationship with Zhou Jinbei, so that Zhou Jinbei’s reputation will be ruined?” ”

“Xie wanqiu smiled and said, “Look, look, he hasn’t even married Zhou Jinbei yet, and he’s already protecting him!” ”

“”Aiya, aunt! I’m being serious with you! You still have the mood to joke with me!” ”

“Xie wanqiu patted Xie Rongle’s hand and said, “Rongle, don’t worry. Zhou Jinbei is in your hands. He can’t run away!” ”

“What’s the use of running away?”Xie rongle pursed her lips. “He’s going to lose his reputation!”

“She was going to be a rich lady, not a down-and-out lady. ”

“Xie wanqiu continued, “He can’t be defeated.” ”

“”Aunt, what do you mean?”Xie rongle suddenly could not understand what Xie wanqiu meant. ”

She saw that Zhou Zuolong was serious this time.

What did he mean by he could not be defeated?

“Xie wanqiu smiled and said, “Zhou Jinbei is a big shot who has touched China. Do you think he will really risk his future? “To tell you the truth, your uncle has already used the same method many times. As long as the press release is sent out, he will not be able to sit still and will definitely come to your uncle personally to beg him. When that time comes, we will say one thing and he will dare to say another?” ”

Public opinion was crushing people.

“It was especially so for a public figure like Zhou Jinbei. He was most afraid of dirt, especially dirt that did not support the elderly. ”

“When he heard this, Xie rongle heaved a sigh of relief. “So that’s how it is! I really thought that uncle wanted to sever the relationship between father and Son!” ”

Xie wanqiu patted Xie Rongle’s hand. “Let’s just wait for a good show.”

“Okay.”Xie rongle nodded.

“The media reporters moved very quickly. In less than half an hour, reporters came knocking on the door. ”

Zhou Zuolong sat on the hospital bed and complained about Zhou Jinbei’s unfilial behavior with tears in his eyes.

“”When his mother left, he was only eight years old, and his sister was thirteen years old. It was Wanqiu and I who raised him up, but now, he views us as his enemies! “Whether I raised him or not, the father’s fault is all my fault. It’s my fault for not educating the child well. I’ve let down my first wife in the afterlife! “Alan, I’ve let you down!” ”

“The reporter sat in front of Zhou Zuolong and handed him a piece of tissue paper. “May I ask, Old Mr. Zhou, is the son you speak of Mr. Zhou Jinbei, one of the five big figures in China?” ”

“”Yes, he is my unfilial son.” ”

“Hearing this, the reporter pretended to be surprised and said, “I didn’t expect Mr. Zhou Jinbei, who touched the five great figures of China, to be such a person in real life! May I ask if there is any misunderstanding?” ”

“No.”Zhou Zuolong shook his head. “The wife I married after me is even closer to him than her own son. I really can’t figure out what I did wrong to let him treat me like this!”

“”Then do you hate your son, Zhou Jinbei?” ”

“”I don’t hate him. He’s my own son. What do I hate about him? I just can’t figure out why he became like this! That’s my son, my own son!”Zhou Zuolong cried bitterly, “I know that child hates me for marrying the current wife, wanqiu. But in that era, was it easy for me to raise two children by myself? Ever since I married Wanqiu, Wanqiu treated them better than her own children!” ”

The reporter sighed.

“Zhou zuolong continued, “To tell you the truth, my wife Wanqiu’s biological daughter died because of my wife’s daughter. However, Wanqiu never blamed my daughter. She always treated her like her own child!” ”

“The reporter asked in surprise, “Can you tell me what happened?” ”

“Zhou Zuolong shook his head. “The matter has already passed. Let’s not talk about it anymore! My Son has always thought that I had something to do with my wife’s death, but he never knew that his biological mother had eloped with someone else and died of love!” ”

“”Died of Love?”The reporter seemed to have dug up some big secret of the day. “Actually, old Mister Zhou, I’ve long heard of this rumor, but I thought that the outside world was making up stories about your late wife. Could it be that all of this is true?” ”

“”Yes, it’s true! “I’m a man. Could it be that I can wear a cuckold on my own head? “My late wife died of love while lying in bed with someone else.”Zhou Zuolong smiled bitterly and said, “But even so, I still love her deeply. I had no choice but to remarry. I’ve never said anything bad about my late wife in front of my children. I’ve never said anything bad about her...”. .. ”

“That night, several hot searches appeared on Weibo. ”

# Zhou Jinbei doesn’t support the elderly #

# touching scandal of China’s top five figures # Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

# Zhou Jinbei scram out of China! #

# Zhou Jinbei is disgusting! #

“There were four hot searches in total, and all of them were explosive. ”

“Zhou Jinbei had always been a righteous philanthropist who had appeared in front of the public. When such a scandal suddenly broke out, it caused public outrage! ”

A righteous philanthropist actually did not even support his own parents. What right did he have to become one of the five big figures that affected China.

“For a time, the Zhou group’s stock dropped five points consecutively. ”

The internet was even filled with curses.

“[ a mother really will give birth to a son like that. A mother has died in love with someone else, but a son does not support an old man! ] ”

[ I don’t think that sister of his is a good sister. ]

“[ I suggest that the country issue a law specifically targeting the unfilial elderly. One Life is worth one life. If there are no elderly, the current you, someone like Zhou Jinbei, should be sentenced to death! ] ”

“[ the death penalty is too easy on him. He should be sentenced to life, and be imprisoned for the rest of his life! ] ”

“[ the one above looks like he doesn’t have any common sense of the law. Although the life sentence is said to be life, it is actually only twenty years. ] ”

“[ death penalty! Then, you will be stripped of your nationality! ] ”

“[ old Mister Zhou is so pitiful. He is already so old, yet he is still crying so sadly in front of the screen. When I see Old Mister Zhou, I think of my grandfather. My grandfather is the same as old Mister Zhou. He is an extremely kind and sensible old man. Unfortunately, my second aunt is an unfilial person. Fortunately, she has my father! It’s a pity that Mr. Zhou didn’t raise another child ”

“This unfilial thing, it’s useless even if you raise ten ”

“Looking at Mr. Zhou’s current wife, I know that she’s a good woman. It wasn’t easy to raise Zhou Jinbei and his sister. When they were together, they should have been quite young. Why didn’t they have another child? [ Mr. Zhou and Grandma Xie are both good people. The child that they gave birth to must be a good child that is filial to the elderly! ] ”

“[ I know the Inside Story! ]! Back then, Mr. Zhou and Wu Lan were in a free relationship. After marriage, they had two children. In order to prevent Mr. Zhou from cheating, Wu Lan asked Mr. Zhou to have a vasectomy. Who would have thought that the person who cheated in the end would be Wu Lan! ] ”

“[ F * ck, asking a man to have a vasectomy? Isn’t that too disgusting? ] ”

“[ the disgusting thing is not to have a vasectomy. If you truly love someone, it doesn’t matter who gets the vasectomy. The most important thing is that Wu Lan actually had an affair in the end. This is what made Mr. Zhou the most sad. ] ”

“[ sob sob sob... When I saw Mr. Zhou crying so sadly, I also cried! ] ”
