“”I see,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

Ye Zhuo took out the tool to remove the forbidden spell. “Did you hear what uncle said just now? I feel that all of this can not be blamed on uncle...”

“Indeed, Cen Haifeng could not be entirely blamed for this matter. ”

“The technology of the Allied countries was much more advanced than that of Earth to begin with. Their civilization was also several levels higher than Earth’s. When Cen Haifeng was brought to the Allied countries, he had already been placed under the forbidden spell. He did not intend to forget about them. ”

“Of course, she was not Cen Old Lady, nor was she Zhou Xiang, nor was she cen Shaoqing and his four sisters. Therefore, her words could only be used as a reference. ”

The choice of what to do next was still in the Cen family.

Cen Shaoqing did not say anything.

“Although all of this was not entirely CEN Haifeng’s fault, he still could not forgive Cen Haifeng. ”

“”Zhuozhuo, what do you think I should do now?”Cen Shaoqing looked at Ye Zhuo and asked. ”

“Ye Zhonghua thought for a moment and then said, “I think you should give this choice to Aunt Xiang. No matter when and what choice she makes, you will stand behind her and become her biggest reliance.” ”

“”Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Zhonghua, thank you.” ”

“Ye Zhonghua smiled and said, “Why are you thanking me?” ”

“”If it wasn’t for you, I probably wouldn’t know what to do.”Cen Shaoqing sighed softly, then, he said, “All these years, I have never given up on searching for the ship that caused the accident. I always believe that no news is the best news.” ”

“However, what he did not expect was that Cen Haifeng was on the other side of the world while the Cen family was heartbroken. His beautiful wife was in his arms. ”

“Ye Zhuo walked over, shook Cen Shaoqing’s hand, and said with a smile, “Oh right, you are the future Mr. Chief Alliance. If there are rules that require you to marry Duanmu Feng to ascend to the throne, what will you do?” ”

“What do you think?”Cen Shaoqing turned to look at Ye Zhuo.

“Ye Zhuo said, “I’m asking you.” ”

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “I said that I will never let you down in this life!” ”

He did not care about the position of the General Alliance at all.

“Ye Zao chuckled. He hooked his arms around his neck and tiptoed, planting a kiss on his thin lips. ”

It was like a dragonfly skimming the water.

“It’s for you.”

“After saying that, he left. ”

“Cen Shaoqing suddenly reached out and hooked his arm around her waist. “Since you’ve already been rewarded, why can’t you give me a little more?” ”

“Stop fooling around!”Ye Zhuo reached out and pressed his lips against hers. “Uncle is still here!”

Cen Shaoqing planted a hot kiss on her palm and then released her.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Go and bring me the pot of purple snow grass outside.” ”

“Is it the Purple Pot?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Cen Shaoqing turned around and walked outside. Very soon, he brought the purple snow grass. ”

Time passed very quickly.

“In the blink of an eye, two days had passed. ”

“When Cen Haifeng opened his eyes again, he saw a vast expanse of white. ”

Where was this?

“Cen Haifeng reached out and pressed his temples. Then, he remembered what had happened. ”

“At this moment, ye Zhuo walked over with the nutrient solution. “Uncle Cen is awake.” ”

“Cen Haifeng nodded and asked, “Miss Zhuo, I slept for two days?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly and handed the grape-flavored nutrient solution to CEN Haifeng.

Cen Haifeng took the nutrient solution. “Thank you.”

“You’re welcome.”

“CEN Haifeng continued, “I wonder if Miss Zhuo has found the forbidden clan?” ”

“”Yes,”ye Zao smiled and said, “I’ve also kowtowed on behalf of my ancestors.” ”

“”That’s good.”Cen Haifeng looked at ye Zao and asked, “By the way, Miss Ye, has my forbidden technique been solved?” ”

“Solved.”

Solved?

“Hearing this, Cen Haifeng looked at Ye Zao in disbelief and said, “Since the forbidden spell has been solved, why can’t I remember anything?” ”

His mind was blank.

“”Don’t worry,”ye Zao explained, “Although the forbidden spell has been solved, you have been stuck in the forbidden spell for too long. In the process, you need a buffer.” It would not immediately return to normal after the forbidden spell was removed. ”

“”Then, when will I be able to remember those things?”Cen Haifeng asked. “How long will it take to buffer?” ”

“”This varies from person to person.”Ye Zhuo placed the flowers picked in the morning in a vase. “At least three to five days, at most three to five years.” ”

She could not tell the exact time.

“CEN Haifeng said, “Thank You, Miss Zhuo. By the way, where is Mr. Shao?” ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “He has something to do outside. By the way, Uncle Cen, we are now in the state of Changyue. Where do you live? I can send you back.” ”
