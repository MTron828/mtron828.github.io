Chapter 127: 079: confirmed return date, Strange Bite Mark 6

Ye Zao opened the red packet.

188.

It was 100 yuan more than her bag.

Ye Zao curled her lips slightly. It was said that capitalists were stingy and stingy. It seemed that Cen Shaoqing was a different kind of person.

[ thank you, Boss. [ dog head ]

[ you’re welcome. What is Miss ye doing? ]

[ setting off fireworks. [ dog head ] ye Zao replied and took a video and sent it over.

It was quite lively on her side.

Cen Shaoqing looked at the cold desk in front of him and went to the French window.

It was forbidden to set off fireworks in the capital.

It was very quiet at night on the 30th day of the Lunar New Year, which was no different from normal times.

Cen Shaoqing took a photo on his phone.

[ are you in the capital? ]

[ yes. I’ll be back the day after tomorrow morning. ] Cen Shaoqing was stunned as soon as this message was sent out.

Why did he have to report his schedule to Ye Zhuo?

[ have a safe trip. ]

[ thank you. ]

After ye Zhuo finished setting off the fireworks, he went home and started the live broadcast.

As soon as the live broadcast started, he received an invitation to pvp from the laid-back layman.

Ye Zhuo slightly raised his eyebrows.

This laid-back layman was really not simple. He had lost countless times, yet he was still so indomitable.

...

On the other side.

Lin Ze and his friends came to the agreed place to set off the fireworks.

Four young men.

They brought a lot of fireworks.

“Brother Ze, Happy New Year!”

“Happy New Year.”

The four of them lit the fireworks and sat to the side to chat.

“Brother Ze, now that we’ve confirmed that your mother is in Yunjing, what do you plan to do?”Li Wen asked.

Hearing this, the other two turned to look at Lin Ze.

“Go look for her.”

“Are you going alone?”Buttface asked.

Lin Ze nodded.

“But Yunjing is thousands of kilometers away from us! Besides, Yunjing is a big city and doesn’t know anything. Where are you going to look for her?”

It was like looking for a needle in a haystack.

Lin Ze continued, “I’ve checked. Yunjing is a municipality under the central government. There are 20 districts, including 10 in the Central District with a population of 31.26 million. Among them, there are 12 million outsiders. “I’ll look for her bit by bit. Even if I can’t find her this year or next year, I can wait until the year after next year or the year after next year until I find her.”

Perhaps no one could understand the psychology of a child who had never even met his mother.

In short, before he found his mother...

He would never give up on his search.

Hearing this, the other three looked at Lin Ze in surprise.

Li Wen continued, “But what if your mother had already married someone else and forgotten about you?”

It had been eighteen years.

The world had changed.

Who knew what had happened after such a long time.

“Then I’ll take a look from afar and not disturb her.”

Just a look.

Even if she didn’t say anything.

“What if your mother had already moved out of Yun Jing?”

Lin Ze was stunned.

It was obvious that he hadn’t thought about this question.

After a long while, Lin ze said, “That might be my fate! But before I go to Yun Jing, I will never accept my fate!”

“Brother Ze,”Li Wen patted Lin ze’s shoulder, “I believe that you will definitely find your mother.”

“I believe it too!”Dog Two said.

“And me!”Fat tiger continued, “Oh right, brother Ze, I have a relative in Yun Jing. I can ask her to help me find out more information about Auntie. Oh right, do you know anything else about Auntie? For example, her appearance. Is there anything special about her?”

Lin Ze shook his head.

“It’s okay.”Fat Tiger patted Lin Ze’s shoulder and comforted him, “Brother Ze, my relative is quite powerful in Yun Jing. Even if you don’t know anything, I can ask her to keep an eye out for you.”

“Thank you, Fat Tiger.”

Fat Tiger’s face turned red. “What’s there to thank? We’re all Brothers!”

Li Wen continued, “When do you plan to go to Cloud Capital?”

“Our school starts on the fifteenth of the first lunar month. I plan to fly there on the eighth day of the first lunar month.”

Li Wen nodded.

At the same time.

At the MU residence.

At the reunion table, Big Soldier Mu looked at Mu Yourong, he said doubtfully, “Yourong, the last time I asked you to look for elder Yang, you didn’t look for him either. There hasn’t been any movement since. Tell me, did he forget about you, his life Savior?”

Soldier Mu had even prepared a banquet to celebrate.

Now, he was just waiting for Old Master Yang to come and thank him.

At that time, his daughter would be old master Yang’s life-saving benefactor, and he would also be able to bask in his glory.

At the mention of this matter. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Mu Yourong would die of anger!

If it weren’t for ye Zao interfering and stealing the credit that should have belonged to her, would she have ended up like this?

The live broadcast couldn’t be started, and she didn’t know how to play chess...

She even became the laughing stock of the entire Internet.

“Old Mister Yang shouldn’t be coming again,”Mu Yourong said.

“Why?”Soldier Mu’s expression changed.

Mu yourong continued, “He... This matter can’t be explained in a short amount of time. Father, please don’t ask anymore!”

Seeing Mu Yourong like this, soldier Mu couldn’t ask anymore.

This daughter of his had always had many thoughts.

Perhaps she had other plans?

After eating, she returned to her room.

Mu Yourong received many new year greetings.

Among them were Lin Xuan and Lin Xue.

These two sisters of the Lin family all climbed up and trampled on others. In the past, when she was still with Ye Shu, the two of them had never looked her in the eye. Occasionally, they would speak to her in a mocking tone.

Ever since they found out that she was the eldest daughter of the Mu family, the two of them had become extremely attentive.

They called her sister one after another, calling her affectionately.

Mu Yourong narrowed her eyes and suddenly thought of ye Dafu and Yao Cuifen.

If these two knew that ye Shu had not only opened a restaurant, but that their granddaughter, Ye Zhuo, was also a live broadcast celebrity, how would the two of them react.

Didn’t ye Zhuo like to cause trouble for her? Steal her things?

Then she would let ye Zhuo not only meet that scum song Shiyu, but also send ye Zhuo and a few shameless top-notch relatives!

She would make ye Zhuo sick to death!

Once she was pestered by those top-notch relatives, even if ye Zhuo had three heads and six arms, there was nothing she could do.

With this thought in mind, Mu Yourong curled the corners of her lips and replied to Lin Xuan.

[ Happy New Year, big cousin. ]

Lin Xuan did not expect Mu Yourong to reply to her and even call her big cousin. She was stunned for a moment before replying.

Mu Yourong then sent a message: [ long time no see, big cousin, do you have time to come out? ]

Lin Xuan: [ Okay. ]

Mu Yourong: [ it’s better to choose a different day. Do you have time tomorrow afternoon? ]

Lin Xuan: [ Yes. ]

The first day of the New Year.

Early in the morning, Ye Sen got up and prepared to pay his friends a new year call after dinner.

Ye Sen took out two pairs of pants and walked to ye Zao’s door. He asked, “Eldest niece, do you think I look young in those pants? Is it this dark blue one or this light black one?”

Ye Zao looked at Ye Sen and seriously considered it for two seconds. “Uncle, are you sure you want me to tell the truth?”

Yesen nodded.

Ye continued, “I think you look younger in diapers.”
