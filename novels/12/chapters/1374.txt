Home and all things prosper.

“Moreover, she and Zhou Zuolong both had the same blood flowing from their bodies. ”

“Although when she was young, Zhou Zuolong was not very good to her, often hitting and scolding her. ”

“However, she could understand Zhou Zuolong. ”

Because she looked like the deceased Wu Lan.

“Zhou Zuolong was first a man, then a father. ”

Zhou Zuolong would definitely be angry at Wu Lan for treating him like that.

“Once Wu Lan died, who would Zhou Zuolong find to vent his anger on? ”

“Wu Lan had already betrayed Zhou Zuolong, causing him to live in pain. As his daughter, she could not let Zhou Zuolong be disappointed. ”

“”Xiangxiang,”Xie Wanqiu looked at Zhou Xiang, her eyes filled with helplessness. “Why can’t you understand? We’re doing this for your own good!” ”

“Although she knew that Xie wanqiu would not necessarily help her, Zhou Xiang still could not help but pray to Xie wanqiu. “Mom, I’m begging you! Can you just pity me?” ”

“Xie Wanqiu did not know what to say. She looked up at Zhou Zuolong. “Old Man, how about...” ”

“Before she could finish her sentence, Zhou Zuolong interrupted her, “How can you say that! Zhou Xiang, I’ll give you one more day. If I still don’t see the news of Shaoqing breaking up with Ye Zhuo, I won’t have a daughter like you in the future!” ”

Zhou Zuolong dared to say these words because he was sure that Zhou Xiang would not dare to do anything to cut ties with him.

“In fact, Zhou Xiang really did not dare. ”

Her mother was no longer around. Zhou Zuolong was her only father. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Dad!”

“Zhou Zuolong pointed at the door and said, “Scram! I don’t want to see you now!” ”

“”Dad,”Zhou Xiang hugged Zhou Zuolong’s thigh. “I beg you not to do this.” ”

Xie wanqiu looked at Zhou Xiang with disdain in her eyes.

“Previously, when she said that she wanted to sever ties with Zhou Xiang, Zhou Xiang left without saying a word. ”

“Now that it was Zhou Zuolong’s turn, Zhou Xiang was like this. ”

They were related by blood after all.

“In Zhou Xiang’s eyes, her stepmother was nothing. ”

Zhou Xiang was also useless.

“First, Zhou Zuolong betrayed Wu Lan and made her commit suicide by lying on the tracks. Then, he forced Zhou Xiang so much that Zhou Xiang did not even know how to resist. ”

“Not only did she not resist, she even begged Zhou Zuolong so humbly. ”

“As long as Zhou Zuolong insisted, Zheng Wanyin would definitely be able to marry into the Cen family. ”

“Thinking of this, Xie wanqiu heaved a sigh of relief and reached out to help Zhou Xiang up. “Xiang Xiang, your father is currently in a fit of anger. You should leave First!” ”

Zhou Xiang was unwilling to leave just like that. “Dad...”

“Get lost!”

“Xie wanqiu pushed Zhou Xiang out. “Let’s go, Let’s Go!” ”

“Helpless, Zhou Xiang had no choice but to walk out. ”

“Just as they walked out of the hospital hall, her cell phone rang. ”

Zhou Xiang took out her cell phone and her expression changed.

“The person who called was none other than Zhou Xiang’s younger brother, Zhou Jinbei. ”

“Zhou Xiang picked up the phone. “Hello, Jinbei.” ”

“Zhou Jinbei’s voice came from the other side. “SIS, Where Are You Now?” ”

Zhou Xiang turned around and looked at the hospital entrance. “I’m at the hospital entrance.”

“Zhou jinbei continued, “Sis, I’m in Beijing.” ”

“Really?”Zhou Xiang was very surprised.

“”Yes.”Zhou jinbei continued, “Which hospital are you at? I’m here to look for you.” ”

“It just so happens that our father is also at the hospital. Come and see him.”

“When Zhou Zuolong was mentioned, the other side fell silent. ”

“When Wu Lan left, although Zhou Jinbei was only eight years old, he also vaguely knew something. ”

“All these years, he had been investigating the cause of his mother’s death. ”

Unfortunately.

“After investigating for a long time, he still couldn’t find any results. ”

“In Zhou Jinbei’s impression, his mother, Wu Lan, was born into a prestigious family. She was well-read and reasonable, and she could play a piano piece. ”

“Her voice was very gentle, and she would tell him and Zhou Xiang bedtime stories every night. ”

She spent most of her time with him and Zhou Xiang.

“Wu Lan was not a person who would easily seek death, and she would not cheat on Zhou Zuolong. ”

“Moreover, Zhou Jinbei remembered that before Wu Lan’s accident, she had a big fight with Zhou Zuolong. ”

Zhou Jinbei did not believe that Wu Lan was the fickle woman that Zhou Zuolong had described.

This was also the real reason why Zhou Jinbei had run away from home when he was sixteen.

He wanted to clear his mother’s name!

“Thinking of this, Zhou Jinbei’s expression changed, and he thought of Old Lady Cen’s request. “Sister, I’m at the delong Road Cafe. Come and find me.” ”

“Zhou Xiang sighed. “Jinbei, it’s been so many years. Are you still unwilling to forgive Dad? Actually, it’s not easy for dad either...” ”

“At that time, she and her brother were still young and needed someone to take care of them. Zhou Zuolong had no choice but to marry Xie wanqiu. ”
