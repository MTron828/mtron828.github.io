Chapter 96: 075: Heal and save, Brother and sister meet

At this point.

Mu Yourong stood up in a timely manner. “Hello, Old Master Yang. My surname is Mu.”

The reason why she did not stand up earlier was that she was deliberately putting on airs.

After all, she was the successor of the Godly Doctor Hua Tuo. If she was too proactive, wouldn’t that be too demeaning?

Mu Yourong had lived for two lifetimes. She was no longer that little girl who did not know anything back then.

Old Master Yang nodded casually and then said to Yang Danian, “I’ve already found a Divine Doctor Who can cure my illness. This miss mu, you can let her go back.”

“Dad,”Yang Danian could see Old Master Yang’s distrust. “Dad! Please believe me. Miss Mu is really the successor of the Divine Doctor Hua Tuo. Her medicine can really cure you!”

After some understanding, Yang Danian felt that Mu Yourong’s words and actions did not seem like something a teenager should have.

Therefore, Yang Danian trusted mu yourong very much.

The Godly Doctor Hua Tuo was not an ordinary person to begin with, so his successor was naturally not an ordinary person.

Mu Yourong curled her lips into a smile, “I am still young. It is normal for Old Master Yang not to trust me. But there’s one thing I can guarantee. I’m definitely Hua Tuo’s successor! “Elder Yang, I’m only 18 this year. I don’t want to be modest, but have you ever seen an 18-year-old child with such composure and self-control like me?”

Hearing this, elder Yang raised his head and looked at Mu Yourong.

If he had not seen ye Zhuo today, he would definitely think that Mu Yourong was an outstanding junior.

Just as she had said, there were not many eighteen-year-old children who were as calm as her!

She did not speak like a child either.

But after seeing ye Zao, old master Yang was not surprised.

Because compared to ye Zao.

Mu Yourong was not just a little inferior.

She was too proud.

Would the descendant of the Divine Doctor Hua Tuo be so proud and complacent?

Grandfather Yang said, “It’s good for young people to be confident, but don’t you know that excessive confidence is actually arrogance!”

Old Man!

What a big tone!

If it wasn’t for upgrading the system, did he really think that she was willing to save him?

It was fine if he wasn’t grateful to her now, but now he was insulting her instead!

Dogs Bite Lu Dongbin, they don’t know how to appreciate a good person’s heart!

But in order to upgrade the system, Mu Yourong had no choice but to forcefully swallow her anger. “Old Master Yang, if I say something unpleasant, please don’t be unwilling to hear it. Other than my medicine, there is no medicine that can cure your illness!”

The subtext was that if she was missed.

What awaited Old Master Yang was one word.

Death.

Death, who wouldn’t be afraid?

If Old Master Yang had not met ye Zao today.

Perhaps he would have believed mu yourong for once today.

But he had met ye Zao.

Ye Zao was calmer and more reliable than Mu Yourong.

Moreover, Old Master Yang did not believe that a small pill could cure his illness.

If his illness could be cured with a pill, it would not have dragged on until now.

“Miss Mu, it’s not that I don’t trust you, but there are always people better than you. Let’s see our guests off during the New Year!”

“Dad?”Yang Danian looked at Old Master Yang with a troubled expression.

Old Master Yang frowned slightly. “My words are no longer useful, right?” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Mu Yourong smiled lightly and stood up. “Mr. Yang, there’s no need to be troubled. I’ll leave. A doctor’s heart is like a parent’s. I’ve left this pill for Mr. Yang. I hope that Mr. Yang will recover soon.”

After saying this, Mu Yourong turned around and left.

She was one hundred percent sure that old master Yang would definitely take the medicine she left behind.

It was just a matter of time.

Because other than her medicine, there was no one else in this world who could cure Old Master Yang.

When a person was on the verge of death, even if there was only a one in ten thousand chance, he would not let it go.

So.

Old Master Yang would definitely take her medicine.

After Old Master Yang recovered, he would definitely regret his actions today.

She was waiting for the day when Old Master Yang would personally go to Yun capital to apologize to her!

Since she had slapped herself in the face, the scene would definitely be very exciting!

Mu Yourong curled the corners of her lips.

The Yang family manor.

Looking at the box of medicine that Mu Yourong had left behind, old master Yang frowned slightly. “Fu Nian, throw it away.”

Sun Fu Nian nodded. “Yes, Old Master.”

Yang da Nian immediately stopped him. “Dad! This is the medicine that Divine Doctor Hua Tuo left behind. No matter how many people beg for it, they can’t get it. At any rate, it’s a gift from Miss Mu. How can you throw it away just like that!”

Old Master Yang had been shrewd all his life.

Unfortunately, this eldest son of his was not too brainless and could not maintain his reputation.
