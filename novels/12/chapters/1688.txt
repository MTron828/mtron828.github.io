“Ye zhuo nodded slightly, “According to the market price, your house is worth about 3.2 million. If you think it’s okay, we will go to the agency to go through the procedures.” ”

“”Okay, Xiao Ye, if you have no problem, I have no problem,”the landlady said with a smile. ”

The old man and the young man went to the agency together to go through the procedures to buy a house.

...

“In the blink of an eye, it was the day of the college entrance exam. ”

“Early in the morning, Ye Zhuo drove to pick up Lin Sha. ”

“Zhou Yuelian was supposed to go with them. After all, the college entrance exam was a big event in life, but Lin Sha didn’t want her to go with them. ”

“Firstly, her family was busy with business, and secondly, if Zhou Yuelian went with them, she would be under a lot of pressure. ”

The first exam in the morning was Chinese.

“Lin Sha had a good foundation in Chinese, so she didn’t have much pressure. ”

Zou Feifei looked at Lin Sha’s back as she walked in front. He narrowed his eyes and ran up to her with a smile. “Sha Sha.”

“Feifei.”Lin Sha greeted her with a smile. “Why don’t I see Ning Lan?”

“”Ning Lan and I are not in the same exam room,”Zou Feifei said. ”

Lin Sha nodded. “I see.”

“”Well,”zou feifei continued, “By the way, which hotel are you staying in?” ”

“The exam venue was in the suburbs, which was more than an hour’s drive away from the city. It was not convenient to go back, so most of the candidates chose to stay in a hotel nearby. ”

“Lin Sha said, “It’s at the nearby soaring hotel. What About You?” ”

“”What a coincidence, me too,”zou feifei continued, “Ninglan is not here either. I’m bored by myself. Are you here with your friends? Why Don’t I Come With You for lunch?” ”

“Doesn’t anyone from your family come with you?”Lin Sha asked.

“Zou feifei shook his head. He looked a little lonely. “My parents are busy, so I’m alone.” ”

“Okay then. Let’s go together.”

“”Thank you, Sha Sha.”Zou Feifei held Lin Sha’s arm in a very friendly manner. ”

“”You’re welcome.”Although ye Zhuo said that Zou Feifei had some bad intentions, Lin Sha felt that this girl was quite pitiful. She didn’t have anyone to accompany her when she took the college entrance exam. ”

The two of them had just walked out of the school gate when they saw ye Zao.

It was the middle of summer. She was leaning against a camphor tree. She was wearing white clothes and black pants. There was a white wireless earpiece stuffed into her ear. She really had her head lowered. No one knew what she was looking at.

Her expression was serious.

The mottled sunlight seeped down from the leaves and shone on her face. It seemed to give her a shallow layer of light.

“At this moment, a colorful butterfly flew over from the nearby greenery and landed on her forehead. ”

A person and a butterfly. It was quiet and beautiful.

It was like a painting.

This scene fell into the eyes of the tall figure in the distance.

The man was wearing a black suit and looked over there. The ice in his eyes melted.

“He was clearly separated from the bustling crowd, but at this moment, there was only her in his eyes. ” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“”Third brother, what are you looking at?”Bai Jiayu followed his gaze and looked over curiously. ”

“Perhaps because Bai Jiayu was slightly shorter than song Shiyu, he didn’t see anything special. ”

“Mu Tong is here.”Song Shiyu turned his gaze slightly.

Bai Jiayu’s gaze was instantly attracted away. “Little sister Xiao Tong!”

“”Brother Jiayu!”Mu Tong ran over quickly. When she met song Shiyu’s gaze, Mu Tong felt a little apprehensive. ”

“She didn’t know what had happened to her third brother today. He had never cared about her normally, but today, he actually personally sent her to the examination venue. What was even more unexpected was that song Shiyu was actually waiting outside for her to finish the exam. ”

It was somewhat unbelievable!

“Bai Jiayu took the pencil case from Mu Tong’s hand and asked, “How did the exam go?” ”

“”It was alright! It doesn’t matter! Anyway, I’m not going to rely on studying to earn a living!”Mu Tong skipped over to Bai Jiayu’s side, then, she said, “Brother Jiayu, let me tell you, a beautiful girl came to our exam hall yesterday! She’s even prettier than that Internet celebrity, Qingcheng!” ”

“Qingcheng was a female internet celebrity. She lived up to her name and was very good-looking. As a result, she attracted millions of fans overnight! ”

She was an existence that killed both men and women.

“Really?”Bai Jiayu was still very curious about beautiful women. “She’s even prettier than Qingcheng?”

“”Of course!”Mu Tong continued, “Some people in our exam hall said that she looks like Dr. YC! You know Dr. YC, right? She is the mother of the aircraft carrier, the Dr. YC who will lead us to Mars in the future!” ”

“Hearing this, song Shiyu slightly curved his lips, then peeled a milk candy and put it into his mouth. ”

Over here.

Lin Sha brought Zou Feifei to ye Zao’s side. “Zao Zao!”

“Hearing Lin Sha’s voice, ye Zao immediately reacted and took off his headphones. “Are you done with the exam?” ”

“”Yes.”Lin sha nodded and continued, “Zao Zao, no one from Feifei’s family is accompanying her today. She will eat with us later.” ”

“Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Yes, I have already booked the restaurant.” ”

The restaurant was not far from the exam venue. It would only take a few minutes to walk there.

“Because of the college entrance exam, the restaurant’s business was booming. ”

“However, because ye Zao had booked the seats in advance, there was no need to wait in line. ”

“Among the three of them, ye Zao ordered five dishes, one soup, and dessert. ”

“Halfway through the meal, Ye Zao suddenly received a phone call. ”

“After hanging up, ye Zao turned to look at Lin Shasha. “Sister Shasha, I have something to do. I’ll go out for a while. I’ll meet you at the hotel later.” ”

Lin Shasha nodded. “You go ahead!”

Ye Zhuo took his phone and left.

“Zou Feifei looked at ye Zhuo’s back and smiled. “Shasha, your friend is quite busy.” ”

“Lin Shasha nodded. “Yeah, she’s different from us.” ”

“Just then, Lin Shasha received a text message. ”

It was from ye Zhuo.

[ hurry back to the hotel after eating. Don’t interact with Zou Feifei. ]

[ Okay. ]

“Although the reply was good, Lin Sha did not take it to heart. After interacting with Zou Feifei for a while, she felt that Zou Feifei was quite interesting. He should not have any intentions towards her. ”

“After replying to Ye Zao’s message, Lin Sha looked at Zou Feifei. “Feifei, I need to go to the washroom.” ”

“”Okay.”Zou feifei nodded, a light flashing in his eyes. ”

She knew that her chance had come.

“At first, she was still worried about how to deal with Lin Shasha. ”

“Watching Lin Shasha’s back disappear into the air, Zou Feifei took out a white pill from his pocket and put it into Lin Shasha’s Drink Cup. ”

“A few minutes later, Lin Shasha came out of the bathroom. The two of them sat there and chatted for a while before they were ready to leave. ”

“Before they left, Zou feifei smiled and said, “Wait, I haven’t finished my drink yet. I’ll leave after I finish it. It’s so hot outside.” ”

“Seeing Zou Feifei drinking his drink, Lin Sha realized that she hadn’t finished her drink either. She immediately picked up her cup and finished her drink in one gulp. “Let’s Go!” ”

The two of them chatted and laughed as they returned to the hotel.

“After returning to his room, Zou Feifei immediately contacted his contact on wechat. [ can you hack the surveillance camera of the restaurant on the road from 11:50 to 12:00? 1w. ] ”

The other party replied with an ‘ok’.

“Looking at the other party’s reply, Zou Feifei heaved a sigh of relief and immediately transferred the money over. ”

On the other side.

It was three o’clock in the afternoon when Lin Sha took a math test. She took a nap.

“When she woke up, it was already two o’clock. Ye Zhuo was still not back yet. ”

“Just when Lin Sha was about to call ye Zhuo, she suddenly felt a sharp pain in her abdomen. Her face turned pale instantly. ”

It was so painful that she could hardly stand up straight.

The pain reminded her of that bad experience.

It was the same pain when she had a miscarriage!

“Beads of sweat rolled down her forehead. She grabbed her phone and tried to call the emergency number, but in the next second, she fainted! ”
