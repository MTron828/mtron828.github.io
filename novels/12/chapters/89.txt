Chapter 90: 074: strength slaps the face, stunning all four! 4

Mu Yourong’s go style was clearly not on the same level as ye Zao’s.

It was obvious that they were not on the same level.

Mu Yourong’s go style was like a machine that did not know how to be flexible. All she cared about was eating the stones. She did not realize that the other party had already invaded her inner circle.

Bit by bit, it destroyed her army’s morale.

[ Ye Zi is awesome! It makes my blood boil! ]

[ F * ck! F * ck! I’m so excited! ]

[ I love leaf to death! ]

[ exciting! ! ! ! ]

[ I want to learn chess too! I want to learn from leaf! ]

[ you made Bitch M so proud just now! Now You’ve been slapped in the face by our leaf, right? ]

[ Bitch M is trash in front of our leaf! Trash! ]

[ where are those people who said that our leaf would definitely lose? Come out! Why aren’t you saying anything now? ]

Someone posted on the bullet screen, “I, Leaf, V587! Glory World Beauty!”

Then, the bullet screen was flooded with these words.

[ F * ck! Aren’t you guys too scary? Posting so many screens has affected my appreciation of Leaf’s glory world beauty! ]

[ as a leaf fan, I’m really gratified to see leaf go from being a cute little girl to being on the hot searches, being accused of cheating, and then to leaf’s perfect counterattack, crushing MY appearance with her strength! I am also very glad that I have never given up on liking ye Zi! Ye Zi is worthy of my liking! ]

[ I have followed Ye Zi all the way until now. When Ye Zi was questioned, it was also the darkest period of time for us ye Zi fans. Fortunately, we did not give up! ]

[ I am a fan of Rong Zi. From today onwards, I will become a fan of her. ]

[ ye Zi let me know that there is sunshine and darkness in this world. When we face doubts, don’t be sad and don’t be discouraged. Remember to surge forward! ]

[ I’m Crying! ]

[ there has never been a streamer who could make my blood boil like this! ]

Mu Yourong’s face immediately turned pale.

Looking at the anticipation that had already been set in stone, her back broke out in layers of cold sweat.

What was going on?

How could she lose?

She had the help of the system and a top-tier chess skill. What did ye Zao have?

How could ye Zao win against her?

“System! What’s going on? Why did ye Zao Beat Me? Didn’t you say that no one was my match?”

The system was confused.

It had always been invincible.

This was the first time it had been defeated!

[ the system has been forced to level 1! Retracting the host’s top-tier chess skill! Level 5 beauty skill! Attention-grabbing skill! ]

Listening to the system’s cold voice.

Mu Yourong almost broke down.

It was gone!

Everything was gone!

All the skills were gone.

What should she do now?

Ye Zhuo!

Ye Zhuo, this little B * Tch!

“Miss M, have you fulfilled our bet?”Ye Zhuo looked at Mu Yourong without any expression in his eyes, but mu yourong could see the mockery in her eyes.

Slut!

Did she really think that she could do whatever she wanted just because she won against her?

Mu Yourong’s lowered eyes were filled with shame.

The bullet comments were very interesting.

[ why do I feel that my appearance isn’t just right? ]

[ upstairs, you’re not alone. I feel as if something is suddenly missing from her body! An indescribable feeling... ]

[ F * ck! I also suddenly feel like she’s suddenly ugly! Sitting with Yezi, she’s like a backdrop... ]

[ what’s going on? My Rong was so radiant just now, how did she suddenly become like this? If I didn’t see it with MY own eyes, I would have suspected that she’s a different person... ]

[ I’m a fan of Rong. I used to really like MY rong. I thought she was a streamer with a very good outlook on life. I didn’t expect her to disappoint me today. ]

[ I’m a fan of Rong Rong. I apologize to Ye Zi and Ye Zi. ]

[ does this M Y Rong not deserve to lose? ]

[ I suddenly realized that Rong Rong is so ugly! Was I blind in the past? How did I become a fan of such a streamer? ] FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

[ to be honest, I used to think that Rong Rong was quite magnanimous. But today, she really disappointed me. She can’t afford to lose, and she’s so shy. She’s far inferior to YC! ]

[ de-powder and de-powder! ]

[ I’m also a fan of Rong, starting from today. ]

[ Goodbye! ]

It wasn’t just the audience in front of the screen who felt that Mu Yourong had become ugly. Even the audience present felt that Mu Yourong had changed quite a bit.

That feeling was like the bright stars had lost their luster.

It was incomparably dark.

Just a moment ago, he could barely compare with ye Zhuo, but now...

Li Qiandong slightly frowned, feeling very strange in his heart. He had clearly admired mu yourong very much before.
