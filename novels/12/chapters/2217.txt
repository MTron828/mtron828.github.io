“Hearing this, man Wen heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. ”

They didn’t misunderstand him.

It was good that ye Zhuo didn’t misunderstand him.

“Even if everyone could misunderstand him, it was fine as long as ye Zhuo didn’t misunderstand him. ”

When he saw ye Zhuo.

“Fan Mu cried out in surprise, “Miss Ye!” ” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Wen Yang, who was at the side, was similarly surprised. “Didn’t you say that Miss Ye wouldn’t be coming?” ”

“Fan Mu said, “That’s what Miss Ye told me previously!” ”

“Speaking up to this point, fan mu seemed to have understood something and instantly reacted. “So Miss Ye is putting on an act for Manwen to see! Otherwise, why would manwen let down his guard! Absolute, really too absolute! As expected of Miss Ye!” ”

“After learning that ye Zao was not that kind of cold-blooded and heartless person, Fan Mu was even happier than Manwen himself. ”

“Whether or not ye Zao could help man Wen to clear his name, it would at least prove that man Wen’s kindness towards ye Zao had not been let down by Ye Zao. ”

“Man Xing did not expect this at all. At this moment, she was at a loss. ”

“Not only did she not expect ye Zao to come, she also did not expect man Wen to come back to life. ”

The neck of the pheasant domesticated by the Shangguan family was incurable. How did man Wen Come Back to life?

And Ye Zao.

“According to the information provided by the informant, ye Zao had obviously chased fan mu and the others out. Why did ye Zao Come Back Now? ”

“Thinking of this, man Xing suddenly realized something! ”

They had been tricked by Ye Zao.

Ye Zao was creating a diversion. She had intentionally let down her guard.

“Thinking of this, man Xing frowned slightly. Also, now that man Wen had come back to life, wouldn’t the crime of committing suicide be disqualified? ”

What should she do now?

She couldn’t Panic!

She couldn’t panic now.

Man Xing took a deep breath.

So What If ye Zao Came?

“As long as Sun Xiaowen insisted that it was man Wen who ordered him to do it, man Wen wouldn’t be able to escape suspicion. ”

“Moreover, Sun Xiaowen was already dead. Before Sun Xiaowen died, he had already drawn a seal on the document. His final testimony identified man Wen as the real murderer. ”

“Now, there was no way to prove it. ”

“Not to mention ye Zao, even if another ye Zao came, Manwen would only end up dead. ”

“As long as Manwen was dead, then she would win. ”

“Manxing tried his best to calm himself down. Both of his hands gripped the armrest of the chair tightly. Because he had used too much strength, his knuckles had already turned slightly white. His gaze was fixed on ye Zao. This trial was broadcasted live on the entire Internet. In addition, the situation of the case was terrible, killing one’s biological parents. Not only man Xing country, but even the people of Galaxy F had climbed over the wall to watch the live broadcast. ”

“Under the watchful eyes of the public, if ye Zao did not bring out strong evidence, he wanted to bail out man Wen? ”

Difficult!

“Even if ye Zao really had the ability to bail out man Wen, it would still be difficult to appease the public’s anger! ”

“Thinking of this, man Xing narrowed his eyes. ”

“At this time, the judge said, “Miss Ye, please present your evidence.” ”

“Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and turned to look at Leo, who was not far away. ”

Leo immediately understood and brought someone over.

“When they saw who it was, the people in the audience started to discuss. ”

This case was really too interesting!

“First, the main culprit had risen from the dead, and now the accomplice had also risen from the dead! ”

“Sun Xiaowen! That’s Sun Xiaowen!”

“When he saw Sun Xiaowen, Manxing’s face turned slightly pale. ”

Sun Xiaowen?

“She had obviously gotten someone to quietly deal with Sun Xiaowen, so why was Sun Xiaowen still alive? ”

“At this moment, Manxing’s hands were trembling, and she couldn’t control her fear. ”

She couldn’t imagine what kind of criticism she would receive if Sun Xiaowen revealed everything.

Her life had just begun.

No.

No.

“But at this moment, other than being afraid, she could do nothing else. ”

The always aloof and omnipotent man xing tasted fear for the first time.

She could only pray that Sun Xiaowen could continue with his previous plan and not give her up.

“”Comrade judge, I am Sun Xiaowen. I am also one of the suspects in this case. First of all, I want to apologize to Mr. Man Wen,”said Sun Xiaowen, sun Xiaowen looked at man Wen and bowed deeply, “Previously, I perjured myself. Mr. Man Wen did not hire a murderer and he is not the real murderer behind the scenes. I have no contact with Mr. Man Wen before this. Mr. Man Wen, I am sorry...” ”

Man Wen just stood there and looked at Sun Xiaowen. “Why did you do this?”

“”Because of her.”Sun Xiaowen turned to look at man Xing. “Your sister, man Xing.” ”

“As soon as he said this, the noise in the air instantly disappeared. ”

Oh My God!

What did they hear?

The person who really paid for the murder was actually man Xing!
