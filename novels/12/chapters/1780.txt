Translator: 549690339

“Sister Sha Sha.”

“Lin Sha smiled and said, “Where’s your husband? Didn’t he come with you?” ”

“Ye Zao said, “He went back.” ”

“Lin Sha let out a sigh of relief and held ye Zao’s arm. “To be honest, your husband’s aura is too strong! I always get flustered.” ”

“Ye Zao said, “Don’t worry, he doesn’t hit people.” ”

“Lin Shasha smiled and said, “I know he doesn’t hit people, but that kind of feeling is very strange. You Can’t control it, do you understand? “Just like the first time I saw you. At that time, I and the beautiful woman who thought she was cold and aloof didn’t dare to talk to you.” ”

Cen Shaoqing was different from ye Zao.

Ye Zao was happy to make friends. Cen Shaoqing could stay with people he wasn’t familiar with for a whole day without saying a word.

“Ye Zao smiled and turned his eyes, “Am I not a cold and beautiful woman now?” ”

“”Yes, yes, yes, of course!”Lin Sha continued, “In my heart, you are the flower of the highest mountains!” ” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“That is a must!”Ye Zao raised his head proudly.

“Lin Sha continued, “Oh Right, Zao, you said that your aunt man was going to give birth, and now she has?” ”

“”She gave birth today,”ye Zao said, “It’s a little boy that weighs more than five pounds.” ”

“So Fast!”Lin Sha asked in surprise.

Ye Zao nodded slightly. “It’s pretty fast.”It was as if it had been yesterday since Xia Xiaoman got pregnant.

“The two of them talked as they walked inside. Soon, they arrived at a snack bar that they often patronized. ”

“The snack bar was very busy. Even though it was time to eat, it was still crowded. ”

Ye Zhuo and Lin Sha waited for about ten minutes before they got a seat.

“After ordering, two girls with light makeup came to the table. ”

“”Please move aside,”one of the long-haired girls looked at the two of them and said arrogantly. ”

Ye Zao looked down at his phone and was talking to Yu Zifei about the sudden situation on Mars.

“At the moment, the plants on Mars were dying in large numbers. ”

Ye Zao frowned slightly. He subconsciously felt that there must be an alien civilization involved in this matter.

She had lived on Mars for half a month.

“The climate on Mars was gradually changing. The command was getting better and better, not worse. ”

“”I’m sorry, we were the first ones here.”Lin Sha looked up. ”

The long-haired girl took out a stack of RMB from her wallet and threw it on the table. “This should be enough.”

“Only poor people would eat in such a place. Even if they ordered everything in the shop, it would be less than 800 Yuan, and the money she threw on the table was one thousand yuan. ”

“The girl standing next to the long-haired girl was even more arrogant. From the beginning to the end, she looked at her with disdain. ”

“If it was not for the fact that the person she liked liked liked to eat here, she would not have come to such a disgusting place. ”

“She did not know why a dignified university student, who was also the future successor of the LIN Corporation, would like such a place. ”

“People like them from a high-class society should enter and leave high-class places, champagne and steak. ”

“She had planned to sit here for a while, wait for the food to arrive, and then leave. She didn’t expect the business of this shop to be so good! ”

“If she hadn’t come to this snack street, she wouldn’t have known that there were so many people in China who hadn’t escaped poverty. ”

How Pitiful!

“Lin Sha didn’t expect the other party to directly throw money at her. She frowned slightly and said, “I’m sorry, it’s not about the money. No matter how much you give, we won’t give up this position.” ”

The long-haired girl did not expect Lin Sha to dislike money.

This was a bit shameless.

Could it be that they still wanted two thousand?

“”Hey, how much is a bowl of noodles here? One Thousand Yuan is not a small amount! Don’t try to be nice when you get a bargain!” ”

“There was some impatience in Lin Sha’s voice, “I said this is not a matter of money!” ”

What else could it be if it wasn’t about money?

“The long-haired girl hated this kind of person the most. He was obviously a greedy person who wanted more money, but he still pretended to not care about money. ”

It was really funny.

“The long-haired girl looked at the girl next to her and said in a low voice, “Xiaoxiao, why don’t we change seats? Don’t lower yourself to the level of these two poor people! I think they are crazy poor!” ”

“”No, Senior Colonel Lin always takes this seat every time he comes over.”Xu Xiao continued, “Isn’t it just money? Just give it to them!”In Xu Xiao’s opinion, things that could be solved with money were nothing. ”
