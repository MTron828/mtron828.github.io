“Zhao Pingting said in a low voice, “This place is so beautiful.””

“An Lizi said, “I’ve come to Shuangqiao many times to eat. This is the first time I’ve heard that their second floor also receives guests.””

Zhao Pingting was stunned. “Didn’t their second floor receive customers in the past?”

An Lizi nodded.

“Passing through the hall, she saw Cen Shaoqing sitting by the window. Sitting opposite him was a young man.”

“Hearing the footsteps, Cen Shaoqing turned his head slightly. When he saw ye Zhuo, the ice in his eyes melted. He put down the Buddhist beads in his hand and walked over. “You’re here.””

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded. He took off the scarf and handed it to Cen Shaoqing.

Cen Shaoqing took the scarf and turned around to greet an Lizi. “Cousin.”

Although this wasn’t the first time Cen Shaoqing had called her that.

“But every time, an Lizi felt a mountain of pressure!”

“After all, this person was CEN fifth master.”

“Even if he didn’t do anything, an Lizi felt that the surrounding air was so oppressive that she couldn’t breathe...”

“At this moment, an Lizi really admired ye Zhuo.”

“To think that even a person like Cen Shaoqing, who was at the peak of the mountain, could be subdued so obediently.”

“Looking at Cen Shaoqing’s appearance, one could tell that this person would definitely be a strict wife in the future.”

And it would be the kind that could not be saved.

Cousin?

The manager who was following them was stunned.

He felt that he was hearing things.

“This CEN fifth master looked older than an Lizi, no matter how he looked at it?”

How could he call a little girl sister?

He heard it wrong!

He must have heard it wrong!

“Ye Zhuo turned to look at Cen Shaoqing. “This is my other good friend, Zhao Pingting. According to seniority, you have to call her sister Ting too.””

Sister Ting?

“Zhao Pingting quickly waved her hand. “No need, no need. Mr. Cen, you can just call me by my name.””

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Pingting, you don’t have to be so polite with him.””

“Cen Shaoqing silently recited three times in his heart. Old Madam Cen had taught him the three followers and four virtues. Then, he lightly opened his thin lips. “Sister Ting.””

She really called him sister Ting!

Zhao Pingting raised her head and looked at Ye Zhuo. Her eyes were filled with shock.

“Although she did not know Cen Shaoqing well, through an Lizi’s introduction to science, she had a rough understanding of CEN Shaoqing.”

She did not expect that the flower of the mountains in the eyes of outsiders would be as obedient as a kitten in front of Ye Zhuo.

“Zhao pingting braced herself and said, “Sister, brother-in-law...””

“This address shouldn’t be wrong, right?”

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Sisters, please come in. The dishes have been ordered.””

“Ye Zao looked up slightly. “We haven’t arrived yet, and you’ve already ordered the dishes? Do you know what Lizi and Pingting like to eat?””

“An Lizi said, “It’s okay, Zao Zao. Pingting and I aren’t Picky Eaters.””

“”Yes, yes, yes!””

“Cen Shaoqing looked down at ye searing. “No, I’ve ordered all the dishes on the menu.””

“I wonder if we’re advocating the CD campaign now?”Ye searing raised his eyebrows slightly.

“CEN Shaoqing said, “Don’t worry. I’ve only ordered half of each dish. The five of us will definitely finish it. It Won’t go to waste.””

“Five people? Who’s the other one?”Ye searing asked.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “I bumped into ziteng on the way out. He insisted on coming over, so I brought him along.””

“OH.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Soon, the few of them walked to the side of their seats.”

“When he saw ye Zhuo, he ziteng stood up and said, “Fifth sister-in-law, you won’t mind if I Come Uninvited, right?””

“Ye Zhuo smiled slightly. “It’s lively with so many people. Oh right, let me introduce you. This is my cousin an Lizi and this is my good friend Zhao Pingting. Lizi Pingting, this is he ziteng.””

“He ziteng shook hands with the two of them one by one. “Miss an, Miss Zhao.””

An Lizi smiled. “We are all friends. There’s no need for you to come here. Just call me by my name. I’m an Lizi.”

“Zhao Pingting was more introverted. She nodded and agreed, “Lizi is right.””

“He ziteng said, “Then you can call me he ziteng just like fifth sister-in-law.””

“After they got to know each other, the three of them sat down.”

Ye Zhuo sat next to Cen Shaoqing.

Zhao Pingting and an Lizi sat in the same seat while he ziteng sat next to them. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“They were all young people. After a while, he ziteng started chatting with an Lizi and Zhao Pingting.”

“Are you cold?”Cen Shaoqing looked at ye Zhuo and lowered his voice.

“No.”Ye Zhuo shook his head slightly.

“My hands are all cold.”Cen Shaoqing quietly held ye Zao’s hand under the table. “Let me warm them for you.”

“Why are your hands so Hot?”

“It was winter, and Ye Zao was still wearing clothes that could adjust the temperature, but his hands were cold. Cen Shaoqing looked at him again. He was not even wearing clothes that could adjust the temperature, but his hands were hot.”
