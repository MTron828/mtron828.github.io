Ye Han could not contain his anger and turned around to leave.

“Looking at Ye Han’s back, Zhao Dan snorted coldly. ” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“At this time, Ye Zhuo still had delusions of returning to Manxing country. ”

Was she qualified?

“Ye Han returned to thoughtful rain pavilion and said with a smile, “Sister! You’re really godly! The words that Zhao Dan said to me, and the words that you said to me, were exactly the same!” ”

“If he hadn’t experienced it personally, ye Han wouldn’t have believed that Zhao Dan had said it himself. ”

“He had thought that Zhao Dan’s conscience had realized that he had come to acknowledge ye Zhuo, but he had never thought that Zhao Dan had other intentions. ”

“Now, after seeing the announcement, he had immediately cut ties with Ye Zhuo. ”

It was simply ridiculous!

Ye Zhuo’s expression didn’t change. “Has she left now?”

“”Yes, she has already left!”Ye Han nodded. ”

“”That’s good.”Ye Zao continued, “Then let’s make preparations too. We’ll go back tomorrow.” ”

“Return to Earth?”Ye Han asked.

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

On the other side.

“After ye Han left, Zhao Dan did not stay in changyue any longer. He immediately flew back. ”

“When he learned that Zhao Dan had returned, man Xing was very excited. He stood at the door with his assistant and waited for Zhao Dan. ”

“During this time, he looked at his assistant nervously. “Wen Xi, do you think I can do this now? Can I leave a good impression on elder sister?” ”

“The assistant nodded and smiled. “Young miss, you’re so beautiful. You look good in everything!” ”

“”In this family, only elder sister is the young miss. From now on, you can call me second young miss,”man Xing said. ”

“The assistant was stunned for a moment before saying, “Okay.” ”

“Soon, an aircraft appeared in the horizon. ”

Man Xing lowered his head and tidied up his clothes. The corners of his mouth curled up in a beautiful arc. He stood there in the best state of mind to welcome his mother and eldest sister.

The aircraft had just stopped when man Xing went up to welcome them.

Zhao Dan walked out from inside.

“Mom.”

“Seeing his outstanding daughter, Zhao Dan could not help but smile. “Xing ‘er.” ”

“Man Xing held Zhao Dan’s arm and looked inside. She did not see ye Zhuo and asked curiously, “Where’s elder sister?” ”

“Fortunately, man Xing still remembered ye Zhuo and called him elder sister. ”

Had Ye Zhuo ever thought of man Xing?

“Zhao Dan patted man Xing’s hand. “From now on, you don’t have elder sister.” ”

Man Xing stared at Zhao Dan with wide eyes. Her beautiful eyes were filled with doubt.

“Mom?”

“Zhao dan continued, “Don’t ask why.” ”

“At this point, Zhao Dan sighed. Her eyes were slightly red. “Your eldest sister is a pitiful child. When she was young, it was your father and I who didn’t fulfill our responsibilities as parents. Otherwise, we wouldn’t have given the thief an opportunity!” ”

“Every time she thought of this, Zhao Dan felt extremely uncomfortable and guilty. ”

She had never done anything guilty in her life except for this.

But she had no choice.

She could only blame the full moon for not having a mother-daughter relationship with her.

As for Ye Zhuo...

She refused to admit it.

“After all, Ye Zhuo was ye Zhuo, and the full moon was the full moon. Zhao Dan’s guilt was only towards the full moon. ”

“”Mom, what’s Going On?”Man Xing didn’t understand what his mother meant. “Didn’t you say that Miss Ye is your eldest sister? Then why didn’t she come back with you? Did you see what happened?” ”

“Zhao Dan said, “This child, who told you that Miss Ye is your eldest sister’s? Your eldest sister was killed nineteen years ago.” ”

“Man Xing frowned slightly and continued, “Mom, what exactly happened?” ”

“Let’s go back to the house and talk.”Zhao Dan patted man Xing’s hand. “Where’s your father?”

“”He’s in the house,”man Xing said. ”

“Then let’s go back first.”

“Since they couldn’t get any answers, the full moon could only follow Zhao Dan back. ”

The two of them walked into the house.

“After sending away all the servants, Manxing asked, “Mom, why didn’t eldest sister come back with you?” ”

“Zhao Dan took off the lady hat that shielded the sun. “Xing ‘er, we’ve mistaken you for someone else. Ye Zhuo has nothing to do with your eldest sister. Don’t think about her in the future.” ”

“”Wrong person? How can that be!”MAN XING said, “Dad already said that no matter who you get the wrong person, you won’t get the wrong person for your daughter! Mom, is eldest sister still angry?” ”

“She doesn’t have the right to be your eldest sister. Don’t mention this again in the future!”

“Hearing this, man Xing was very confused. “Why, Mom! Does Dad know about this? Why didn’t you bring eldest sister back? Eldest sister’s childhood experience was already pitiful enough!” ”

“At this moment, a voice from man Jiangshan suddenly came from the air. “Your mom is right. Ye Zhuo doesn’t have the right to be your elder sister. Don’t mention this again in the future!” ”

“Dad? !”Man Xing turned to look at man Jiangshan.
