“Even though he was already over 40 years old, he was still muddle-headed. With the Chen family’s status in Yun Jing, he dared to provoke anything! ”

“”I heard that it has something to do with the new wife of the Zhao family,”the assistant replied. ”

“”The new wife?”Old Master Chen turned to look at the assistant and asked, “Zhao Liu married another woman?” ”

“”Yes.”The assistant nodded. “The new wife seemed to be an old acquaintance of sir. Then, then, then, then sir went to snatch her away and even injured family head Zhao...” ”

“Bastard!”Old Master Chen grabbed the Teacup on the table and threw it on the ground.

Bang!

The Teacup fell to the ground and shattered.

“After saying that, old master Chen turned to look at the butler. “Quickly contact chief Liu.” ”

“Okay.”The Butler nodded and immediately picked up his phone to contact chief Liu.

“Very soon, the call connected. The Butler handed the phone to Old Master Chen. “Old Master, the call connected.” ”

“Old Master Chen took the phone and a smile instantly appeared on his face. “Hello, chief Liu.” ”

“It was unknown what was said on the other end, but the smile on old master Chen’s face instantly disappeared. Then, he hung up the phone. ”

“”Old Master, Chief Liu, what did chief Liu Say?”The Butler asked. ”

Old Master Chen frowned. He had not yet reacted to chief Liu’s words.

“In the past, chief Liu was very respectful to him. But this time, chief Liu actually said something fierce and told him that this time, no one could protect Chen Youlong! ”

What was going on?

Old Master Chen’s face turned paler and paler.

“Seeing Old Master Chen like this, the butler also expected that things would be a little tricky. He continued, “Old Master, don’t worry. There will always be a blessing in disguise for sir. He will definitely be fine! In the past, there were so many difficulties. Didn’t Sir Come here as well?” ”

Old Master Chen frowned. “It’s different this time.”

“After saying that, old master Chen continued, “We’ll return to cloud capital immediately!” ”

“With this happening, Nanhai naturally couldn’t stay any longer. They had to go back and settle Chen You Long’s matter right away. ”

“”Then, then what about the eldest miss?”The Butler asked. ”

Old Master Chen Thought for a moment. “She’ll stay here.”

“He had already returned to cloud capital, so song Shiyu wouldn’t ignore Chen Siyao. ”

“Old Master Chen continued, “Butler, make the arrangements. We’ll leave right away!” ”

“Okay.”The butler nodded.

The Butler immediately went to make the arrangements for returning to Yun Capital.

The assistant pushed Old Master Chen over to Chen Siyao’s place and gave her some instructions.

“Chen Siyao was completely immersed in her love for him. When she heard that something had happened to her father, there wasn’t much of a stir. After all, this wasn’t the first time something like this had happened. ”

“However, Chen Siyao had overlooked one thing. ”

“In the past, when something like this had happened, Song Shiyu had always been the one to handle it. ”

“But now, would song Shiyu still help them? ”

“”Grandfather, you should go back. I know what to do.”Chen Siyao looked at Old Master Chen. ”

“Old Master Chen nodded and continued, “I’ve already gotten someone to spread the news. If you want to act, act well. Don’t give up Halfway.” ”

“I know.”Chen Siyao nodded.

“This time, she had to seize the opportunity. ”

“Old Master Chen continued, “After you’re done, return to cloud capital with Shiyu.” ”

Old Master Chen had a premonition that song Shiyu would have to personally handle this matter.

“”Mm.”Chen Siyao continued to nod. Because she hadn’t eaten for a long time, her face was deathly pale, as if she would faint at any moment. ”

“After explaining everything, Old Master Chen set out to return to Yun capital. ”

“Before long, the news of Chen Siyao’s hunger strike reached song Shiyu’s ears. ”

“”Boss, how should we handle this?”asked the assistant. ”

“Doesn’t she want to die? Then help her!”
