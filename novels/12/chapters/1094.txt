Translator: 549690339

The voices in the air suddenly stopped.

“Looking at Zhao Xueyin who was standing there, the girls looked a little embarrassed. ”

No one expected Zhao Xueyin to suddenly appear.

“Zhao Xueyin said softly, “I wonder if you have heard of this saying? A plucked phoenix is worse than a chicken.” ”

So what if ye Zao was a real Phoenix?

She could still crush ye Zao!

She would let everyone know that she was the real Phoenix!

Ye Zao wanted to compete with her?

Difficult!

“After saying this, Zhao Xueyin turned around and left. ”

“Looking at Zhao Xueyin’s back, the girls looked at each other. “What did Zhao Xueyin mean by that sentence just now?” ” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“It means that she’s a chicken!”One of the short-haired girls said.

“”No Way.”Another girl said, “She should mean that even though she’s a fake Phoenix, she can still crush Miss Ye, that Real Phoenix!” ”

“I hope Miss Ye can give me some strength!”

“Zhao Xueyin returned to the dining room, her expression still not looking good. ”

The lawyer raised his head to look at her. “What’s wrong? Why do you look so bad?”

“”Nothing,”Zhao Xueyin said concisely. “I was accidentally knocked down by someone in the bathroom just now.” ”

“”Knocked down by someone?”Hearing that, the lawyer asked nervously, “Is it serious? Do you want to go to the hospital to have a look?” ”

“Zhao xueyin smiled and said, “How can I be so expensive? I just knocked down.” ”

“Who knocked down me?”The lawyer continued to ask.

“”Someone I don’t know.”Zhao Xueyin was a little speechless and said, “If I knew you were so long-winded, I wouldn’t have told you.” ”

Zhao Xueyin knew Si Lui’s character very well.

She didn’t want to target Chen Xuan.

“But after what happened tonight, she really couldn’t swallow this resentment. ”

“If Chen Xuan hadn’t bumped into her, then nothing would have happened. ”

“Zhao Xueyin wasn’t someone who would throw a tantrum easily, unless the other party had gone too far. ”

“Si lui frowned slightly, a thick haze flashed across his eyes. ”

Zhao Xueyin was kind-hearted and didn’t want to lower herself to the other party’s level.

But he couldn’t.

Zhao Xueyin saw the change in Si Lui’s expression. It was just then that the waiter brought the dishes to the table.

“Zhao xueyin smiled and said, “I’m starving to death. Brother Si, let’s eat quickly! Don’t think about all that nonsense. I’m really fine!” ”

“Si lui nodded, picked up his chopsticks and began to eat. ”

“Halfway through the meal, Zhao Xueyin looked up at si lui and continued, “Brother Si, Cao Wei has been promoting ye Zao for the past few days. I heard that he’s going to arrange a welcoming banquet.” ”

Si lui endured the churning in his stomach and ate a piece of sashimi. “When is the welcoming banquet scheduled?”

Zhao Xueyin shook her head. “I’m not too sure about that either. It should be because I haven’t decided on a date yet.”

“Si lui picked up his cup and drank a mouthful of water. “Since there is a welcoming banquet, we must prepare a big gift for Miss Ye.” ”

“Okay.”Zhao Xueyin nodded.

“After eating, the lawyer sent Zhao Xueyin back before driving back to his own place. ”

“After returning to his cold home, the lawyer tore off the tie on his neck and threw it onto the sofa. Then, he lit a cigarette and slowly exhaled a puff of smoke. After that, he made a call. “Help me investigate something.” ”

...

On the other side.

The Cen family base.

Ye Zao had been staying at the base almost every day for the past few days.

He got off work at night.

Ye Zao came to Dr. Warne’s office.

“Dr. Warne was studying the aircraft carrier’s data map when he heard a knock on the door. He looked up and said, “Come in.” ”

Ye Zao pushed the door open and entered. “Dr. Warne.”

“”Miss Ye.”When he saw Dr. Warne, he immediately stood up from his office chair. “Take a seat.” ”

“Ye Zhuo leaned over to sit opposite Dr. Warne and immediately said, “From Tomorrow onwards, I won’t be able to come to the base every day. During this period of time, I’ll have to trouble you to put in more effort! If there are any problems, you can just contact me directly.” ”

Dr. Warne looked up in puzzlement. “Miss Ye is going on a long trip?”

“Sort of.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Dr. Warne continued, “Alright.” ”

“Ye Zao said, “Then I’ll be counting on you.” ”

“Dr. Warne smiled and said, “Miss Ye, you’re too kind. This is what I should do.” ”

“Although Dr. Warne was older than ye Zao,. ”

He had become famous earlier than ye Zao.

“But these days, he had learned a lot from ye Zao. ”

He had benefited a lot.

Ye Zao’s talent was far more than what the naked eye could see.

She was like a dusty pearl.

“The more she polished, the brighter she became. ”

Dr. Warne had never admired a person so much.
