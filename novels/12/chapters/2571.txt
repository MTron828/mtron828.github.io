Maybe it was because of this ‘brother-in-law’that he fawned over Cen Shaoqing. Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips curled up slightly. “Good luck.”

“”Thank you, brother-in-law.”Dog Two was a person who knew how to cause trouble. Although an Lizi was older than ye Zhuo, he couldn’t call Cen Shaoqing brother-in-law. ”

“Moreover, an Lizi entered the Lin family after Ye Zhuo. According to the order of seniority, it wasn’t too much to call Cen Shaoqing brother-in-law. ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Lizi, you and dog two look quite alike when you stand up.” ”

“”Of course,”an Lizi said. ”

“Dog two looked at ye Zao and continued, “Speaking of which, I have to thank Zao Zao. If not for Zao Zao’s advice, I would still be confused.” ”

“Although an Lizi was dog two’s second girlfriend, because the first relationship ended too quickly, dog two did not learn from it and did not know how to develop the next step. ”

“An Lizi was a girl, so it was not appropriate for her to directly bring up the matter of meeting the parents. He did not know that the two of them were frozen there. ”

It was ye Zhuo who came to chat with him.

“Although the entire conversation took less than ten minutes, dog two suddenly came to a realization. ”

It could be described in one sentence:

Listening to your words is better than reading ten years of books.

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Of course.” ”

“After saying that, ye Zao continued, “If you really want to thank me, just prepare more red packets when the time comes.” ”

“”That’s for sure,”buttface said. ”

“An lizi smiled and said, “There are still my mother’s relatives over there. Zao Zao, I’ll bring him over to say hello first. He’ll come back later.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Looking at their backs, CEN Shaoqing continued, “The two of them reminded me of the first time I went to your house.” ”

Ye Zao Thought for a moment. “How were you feeling then?”

“”I was quite nervous.”Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads. “To be honest, I didn’t fall asleep that night.” ”

All sorts of worries.

He was worried that he wouldn’t be able to get past Lin Jin city and Ye Shu.

Ye Zhuo chuckled. “Really? I don’t even know! What are you worried about? I feel like my parents didn’t make things difficult for you.”

“”Uncle and aunt are one of the reasons.”Cen Shaoqing paused and continued, “Actually, the more important reason is Ah Ze.” ”

“My Brother?”Ye Zhuo was a little puzzled. “Why?”

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “I should have told you that your brother and I had a little bit of a grudge, even though he was only three years old at the time.” ”

“This reminded ye Zhuo of her past. However, Cen Shaoqing was not the one who told her about it. Lin Ze was the one who told her. ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “At that time, my brother even stopped me from being with you. He said that you were prone to violence. What did you do to my brother at that time?” ”

Ye Zhuo was rather curious about this matter.

“He said that I was prone to violence?”Cen Shaoqing asked. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“CEN Shaoqing explained, “It has nothing to do with a tendency to be violent. It’s just that I’ve been mysophobic since I was young.” ”

“Mysophobic?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“”Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly, then, he continued, “Back then, your brother was three years old. Even a three-year-old child wouldn’t like to step in mud. Naturally, your brother was no exception. You Don’t even know how dirty your brother was back then...”the important thing was not that Lin Ze’s body was too dirty, it was that Lin Ze still wanted to pounce on him. ”

A three-year-old child would be familiar with anyone.

“Recalling the past, CEN Shaoqing was very regretful. ”

“If he had known that the youth he had pressed into the swimming pool to wash would become his brother-in-law, he would definitely have worshipped Lin Ze. ”

“Ye Zao laughed out loud. “So, you pressed my brother into the swimming pool to wash him clean?” ”

“”Yes.”Although Cen Shaoqing did not want to admit it, it was the truth. ”

“Actually, pressing him into the swimming pool was not a big deal. What was important was Cen Shaoqing’s disgusted expression at that time. ”

He held the back of Lin Ze’s collar with one hand.

This caused Lin Ze to never dare to step into the CEN family ever again.

“Cen Shaoqing opened his thin lips and continued, “I really didn’t expect that your brother’s memory would be so good.” ”

Ye Zao smiled. “Maybe you left too much trauma in his heart.”

“”I regret it too,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“But how old are you?”Ye Zao asked.

“”Fifteen,”Cen Shaoqing answered. ”

“Ye Zao clicked his tongue. “Mr. Cen, you’re twelve years older than me!” ”

“Don’t you know that there are three good things in an uncle?”

“Ye Zao said, “Which three good things?” ”

“CEN Shaoqing said, “It’s better to be mature and patient.” ”

“At this point, Cen Shaoqing paused before continuing, “If you don’t believe me, why don’t you give it a try?” ”
