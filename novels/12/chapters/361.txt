Feng Xianxian hated Lin ze very much.

“Born as a human being, everyone was equal, but Lin ze always acted high and mighty. ”

He ignored her.

Feng Xianxian could even see a layer of disgust in Lin Ze’s eyes.

The way he looked at her was like he was looking at a pile of trash.

“Yet, every time, she had to put on a long face to curry favor with Lin Ze like a clown. ”

Why?

Lin Ze’s biological mother was just a shameless mistress. What right did he have to be the young master of the Lin Family!

She was born into a wealthy family and had noble blood. What right did Lin Ze have to give her a hard time?

“If it wasn’t for ye Shu stealing Lin Jincheng from Feng Qianhua back then, she would be the legitimate daughter of the Lin family now. What business would there be with Lin Ze? ”

Lin Ze was a shameless bastard!

A bastard who stole everything that belonged to her!

“”Xianxian, what are you standing there for?”Old Mrs. Lin walked in from outside with the help of Aunt Zhang. ”

“Feng Xianxian turned around with a smile. The viciousness in her eyes instantly disappeared, just like the person just now wasn’t her. “Grandma, I was just greeting brother Ah Ze! But brother Ah Ze didn’t seem to see me...” ”

“At the end of her sentence, Feng Xianxian lowered her head, her face full of loneliness. ”

“Hearing this, Old Madam Lin’s eyes revealed a displeased look. ” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“This child, Lin Ze, was really getting more and more insensible. ”

“He clearly knew that she liked Feng Xianxian very much and had already treated Feng Xianxian as her biological granddaughter. He also had plans to let Feng Qianhua marry Feng Xianxian into the Lin family, but he had repeatedly shown his displeasure to Feng Qianhua and her daughter. ”

Who was she doing this for?

It was all for his own good!

She was already so old this year and could die at any time. She did not want Lin Jincheng and his son to be left alone a hundred years later.

“Lin Jincheng’s body was not in good shape, and Lin Ze was a child. ”

There was no woman to take care of him at home.

She was really worried!

“Unfortunately, the father and son were each more heartless than the other. It was fine if they did not appreciate the kindness, but now they had to throw a tantrum. ”

“Thinking of this, Old Lady Lin sighed deeply and continued, “Xianxian, don’t be angry. When that kid comes back, I will definitely teach him a good lesson!” ”

“Feng Xianxian raised her head and said very sensibly, “Grandma, I Don’t blame brother Ah Ze. Please Don’t blame him!” ”

“Old Lady Lin said very gratifyingly, “Xianxian is still the most sensible one.” ”

“Aunt Zhang smiled and continued, “Old Lady, you are also blessed. Although Xianxian is not your biological granddaughter, she is not inferior to other people’s biological granddaughter! Which family’s granddaughter can be so filial?” ”

Feng Xianxian was so filial!

She came over almost every day to talk to Old Lady Lin.

“If it was anyone else, would they be able to do what Feng Xianxian did? ”

“Old Lady Lin agreed with Aunt Zhang’s words. She smiled so much that her eyes could not be seen. Her face was full of kindness. “Yes, yes, yes! It is my fortune to have such a good granddaughter like Xianxian.” ”

“Feng Xianxian smiled and said, “Grandma, please don’t say that. It is my fortune to have such a good grandma like you!” ”

Old Mrs. Lin was even happier after being coaxed.

“As she smiled, Feng Xianxian’s smile faded again. She said worriedly, “Grandma, do you think there’s something I didn’t do well enough that brother Ah Ze doesn’t like me?” ”

“Old Mrs. Lin hugged Feng Xianxian with heartache. “No, no, Xianxian, you’re a very good child. It’s that Brat Ah Ze who doesn’t know what’s good for him!” ”

“”Xianxian, are you talking bad about Ah Ze in front of your grandma Lin Again?”Feng Qianhua walked in from outside the door. ”

“”Mom, I’m Not!”Feng Xianxian raised her head to look at Feng Qianhua. ”

“Feng Qianhua’s face was stern, “Xianxian, how many times have I told you? You and Ah Ze grew up together. Although you’re not blood-related siblings, this friendship can’t be replaced by anything else! Say, why didn’t you learn better? How did you learn to gossip? Hurry up and apologize to your Grandma Lin!” ”

Feng Xianxian apologized to Old Lady Lin very aggrievedly.

“The mother-daughter pair chimed in, causing Old Lady Lin’s heart to ache. “Qianhua! You really misunderstood Xianxian this time! Xianxian is a good child. She won’t gossip behind her back!” ”

“Not only did Feng Xianxian not gossip, she even told her not to blame Lin Ze. ”

“Feng Qianhua said, “Aunt Lin, I’ve watched Ah Ze grow up. I know his personality the best. He definitely wouldn’t do something like bullying a little girl! So, it must be Xianxian’s fault first! Xianxian, this child, has been spoiled rotten by me!” ”
