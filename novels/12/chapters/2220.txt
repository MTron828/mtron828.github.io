Translator: 549690339

She had an irreconcilable feud with Ye Zhuo!

“At this point, man Xing looked at the judge and continued, “Judge, all this evidence is fake! I have never done it before!” ”

“The judge continued, “Since the plaintiff doubts the authenticity of the evidence, we can only invite the appraiser.” ”

“After saying that, the judge turned to look at his assistant. “Invite the appraiser.” ”

“”Alright, wait a moment.” ” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The appraiser waited by the side and quickly walked up.

“After a round of appraisal, the appraiser came to a conclusion. “After the appraisal, the evidence is real, and the video file was not processed in the post-production stage!” ”

What did the evidence really mean?

It meant that Manxing was a murderer!

“Moreover, she had killed her biological parents! ”

“Manxing’s face instantly turned pale. She collapsed on the chair, and the cold sweat on her back almost came out all of a sudden. She was like dead wood and ashes. There was no sense of vitality in her entire body. ”

She knew.

She was done for.

She was really done for.

What should she do now?

Was she really going to die?

“The judge knocked the small hammer again and pronounced Manxing’s crime. “I sentence Manxing to murder her biological parents. The circumstances are vile, and she shall be hanged!” ”

Hanging was a death sentence.

Manxing could no longer listen to anything. His ears buzzed as if he had just died.

Manwen was acquitted on the spot.

“Brother Manwen!”

“That’s Great!”

Fan Mu and Wen Yang ran to Manwen’s side.

The crowd beside them also cheered.

“Manxing looked at the crowd coldly, his eyes filled with malice. ”

She regretted not killing ye Zao right away.

“She thought her future was bright, but who knew that she would end up hanging. ”

“Other than regret, she was also very unconvinced. ”

Her life should not be like this.

“She and Ye Zao were originally from the same mother, and their bodies had the same blood. How could ye Zao control the fate of others with his superior attitude? And she became the victim? ”

“Before Manxing could resist, she was heavily handcuffed by the guards. ”

“Zhao Dan was right. Ye Zao was a jinx. Before ye Zao appeared, their family lived in harmony, and she was the future president of Manxing. ”

Everything changed after ye Zao appeared.

“First, Manwen changed into a different person, and then his parents died... ... ”

She had no one to rely on now.

“Manxing’s helpless tears were brought out by two guards. Before she left, she even turned around to look at Ye Zao, her eyes full of gloom. ”

Ye Zao seemed to have sensed her gaze. He turned around and happened to meet her gaze.

“Her gaze was faint, but it carried an infinite sense of intimidation. ”

“For some reason, man Xing suddenly felt a little guilty and hurriedly withdrew his gaze. ”

“Man Wen walked to ye Zao’s side. “Miss Ye, thank you.” ”

“If it wasn’t for ye Zao, perhaps no one would be able to prove his innocence this time. ”

He was really grateful to ye Zao.

“Other than gratitude, he couldn’t find any other words to use. ”

“Ye Zao raised his eyes slightly and said, “I also have to thank you.” ”

“Man Wen was stunned at first, then he said, “You, you already knew?” ”

Ye Zao did not hide it and nodded slightly.

Man Wen immediately turned his eyes to look at fan mu and Wen Yang.

Could it be that the two of them leaked it?

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “It has nothing to do with them. We can be considered to be even. In the future, neither of us will owe the other.” ”

“Okay.”Man Wen nodded.

“”I still have something to do. I’ll be leaving first.”After saying that, ye Zao turned around and left. ”

“Looking at her back, man Wen couldn’t tell what expression he had in his eyes. After a moment, he bent down and bowed deeply. ”

“When he looked up, he saw ye Zao waving at him without turning his head back. ”

His back was still as wanton as ever.

Everything was said without words.

Man Wen opened his mouth gently and said a single word.

“Sister...”

“Perhaps it was because his voice was too soft, even fan mu who was beside him did not hear him clearly. He only said in a somewhat strange manner, “What are you saying?” ”

“”Nothing much,”man Wen said. ”

“Fan Mu continued, “Miss Ye has left. Aren’t you going to chase after her?” ”

Man Wen shook his head.

The current situation between him and ye Zao was just right.

“Wen Yang continued, “Brother Man Wen, Miss Ye is your sister after all. You Don’t have any other relatives in the world now. Don’t you want to get to know Miss Ye?” ”

“Now that man Jiangshan and Zhao Dan were no longer around.., ”

“ye Zhuo didn’t have any burdens anymore. Logically speaking, the siblings could get to know each other, but neither of them had any intention of getting to know each other. This was a little strange. ”
