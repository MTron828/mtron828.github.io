Chapter 141: 083: great abuse of SCUM, happy people! Great Maternal Love 7

Wen die was thin and small, how could she be a match for the tall and slender ye Shuang?

Within a few seconds, Wen die was pressed to the ground by ye Shuang, her face was slapped so hard that it was not long before her face was slapped into a pig’s head.

The child, who was sleeping soundly, was woken up at this time and went outside barefooted.

He saw Wen die being pressed to the ground and beaten.

The six-year-old child was so scared that he cried loudly at the side.

“Mommy! Mommy!”

Ye Shuang casually grabbed a cup and threw it at the child. “What are you crying for! Your Mother is a shameless B * Tch! You’re not a good person either!”

The child cried even more fiercely.

“Quickly go and find your grandmother!”Wen die shouted. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

What did a six-year-old child know?

He was so scared that his legs turned to jelly! He stood there, not daring to move.

“Bang!”

At this moment, the sound of a heavy object falling to the ground suddenly sounded.

Ye Shuang looked up and saw an old lady standing at the door. The ‘bang’Just Now was the watermelon that the old lady bought fell to the ground.

“Mom?”Ye Shuang looked at his mother-in-law, Zhu Cuihua, in disbelief.

“Grandma!”When the child saw his grandmother, it was as if he saw his savior and immediately ran over.

“Chengye! Chengye, are you okay?”Zhu Cuihua picked up her baby grandson and looked at ye Shuang. “Why are you here? Get lost!”

“Mom! You actually spoke up for this B * Tch and this illegitimate child! Did you know about this long ago?”Ye Shuang stood up and questioned his mother-in-law loudly.

“You’re the B * Tch! You’re the B * Tch who can’t give birth to a son!”Zhu Cuihua hugged Lin Chengye, “If you know what’s good for you, then quickly leave this place! Let’s just forget about today’s matter! Otherwise, when I go back, I’ll let Hai Fu teach you a good lesson!”

“Mom! How can you do this! I’m your daughter-in-law! I’m Hai Fu’s legitimate wife!”Ye Shuang did not expect that her mother-in-law, whom she had respected for more than 20 years, would treat her this way.

Just because she did not give birth to a son for the Lin Family?

“What? You Can’t give birth to a son yourself, and you can’t let others give birth to our Hai Fu? Since you already know about this, then let’s speak frankly! My eldest grandson is called Lin Chengye! The inheritance to inherit the family business! In the future, everything in our old Lin family will belong to him! If you have the ability, divorce my son!”

Zhu Cuihua could not wait for ye Shuang to divorce Lin Haifu immediately.

Once the divorce was over, Lin Chengye could openly become a descendant of the Lin Family!

Wen Die did not have to hide anymore.

Ye Shuang looked at Zhu cuihua like this, her eyes filled with sadness. “Mom! What about Xiao Xuan and Xiao Xue? Aren’t they your granddaughters? If I divorce Haifu, what will happen to them?”

“Those two losers can follow whoever they want!”Zhu cuihua only had her eldest grandson.

To her, Lin Xuan and Lin Xue were just two losers.

“Ah!”Ye Shuang couldn’t take it anymore! She sat on the ground and burst into tears!

The twenty years of waiting had finally become a joke.

A joke!

Taking advantage of this opportunity, Wen die quickly gave ye Shuang a beating.

When ye Shuang came out of the apartment building again, she was in an extremely sorry state.

She thought.

She might as well die.

But on second thought, why should she die?

Should she die so that she could give up her position to that B * Tch?

She couldn’t die!

She wanted Lin Haifu to get his retribution! She wanted him to lose his reputation! He couldn’t turn over a new leaf!

As a doctor.

Not only should he have medical ethics.

He must also have ethics and character.

Having been Lin Haifu’s husband and wife for so many years, ye Shuang knew many of Lin Haifu’s secrets.

The secrets were not big.

But it was enough to make him never be able to turn over a new leaf!

After ye Shuang returned, she tidied up the things in her hands and prepared to send them to Lin Haifu’s competitors.

At this moment.

Lin Haifu returned.

Looking at the man who had slept with her for more than twenty years, ye Shuang’s expression was a little moved at this moment.

She was thinking.

If this man knelt in front of her with tears in his eyes and begged her to forgive him, she might forgive him once.

But she did not.

Not only did Lin Haifu not repent, he even gave ye shuang a hard slap, “B * Tch! Who told you to look for Wen Die! Do you know that you scared Chengye to death! B * Tch! If anything happens to Chengye, I’m not done with you!”

After saying that, Lin Haifu turned around and left.

He did not even look back.

He had been annoyed with ye Shuang for a long time.

Ye Shuang was already fifty-six years old this year. No matter how much she took care of herself, she could not compare to the twenty-three-year-old Wen die.

Moreover, Wen Die had given birth to a son for him.

Ye Shuang looked at Lin Haifu’s back and said with a smile, “Good hit! Lin Haifu! That slap of yours was good! hahaha! It was really good!”

Lin Haifu’s slap directly interrupted all the affection in the past 20 years!

Ye Shuang did not hesitate and directly sent the things that she had sorted out to Lin Haifu’s competitors.

Nothing came as fast as retribution.

The next day, the matter of Lin Haifu cheating and raising a mistress was known to everyone. In the hospital, he was like a rat crossing the street, and everyone shouted for him to be beaten.

Not only that, he was also exposed to scandals such as indiscriminately adding medical fees to patients and molesting female patients.

As soon as the news came out, he was fired.

Of course, facing Lin Haifu were the lawsuits of many of the patients’family members.

Just as ye Shuang was pleased that Lin Haifu was finally punished, another piece of news destroyed her.

Lin Xuan was detained!

It was very likely that she would be sentenced.

These sudden disasters had completely destroyed the Lin family. Ye Shuang’s hair had turned white overnight. She took out all her savings and was prepared to risk her life to bail Lin Xuan out.

In just two days, ye Shuang seemed to have aged more than 20 years. She dismissed the family’s nanny, canceled out the villa and other properties under her name, and moved from the luxurious villa to the dark basement.

At the Ye residence.

A knock on the door broke the silence of the early morning.

Lin Xiaowei walked over to open the door. “Who is it? It’s so early in the morning!”

The moment she opened the door, she saw a few police officers standing outside.

Lin Xiaowei’s drowsiness disappeared in an instant. “Dear police officers, may I know who you are looking for?”

“Is it ye Shuai’s family? Ye Shuai is currently suspected of being involved in a fraud case. Please come with us!”
