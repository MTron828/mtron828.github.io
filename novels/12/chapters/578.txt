Translator: 549690339

Ye Zao?

Old Lady Lin was stunned for a moment.

What did this matter have to do with ye Zao?

“Lin Qingxuan continued, “Mom, Actually, Zao Zao is a very good and outstanding child. Your prejudice against her is too deep. I hope that you can treat her well in the future. After all, she’s your biological granddaughter!” ”

“At this point, Lin Qingxuan paused and said, “If Zhuoluo hadn’t told me about this, I’m afraid that I would have been kept in the dark by Zhao shuning forever, forever living in guilt.” ”

“Hearing this, Old Madam Lin raised her head in disbelief. “You said that this matter was told to you by that wild girl?” ”

Lin Qingxuan frowned. “What Wild Girl? That’s your biological granddaughter!”

“Old Lady Lin was silent for a moment before she said matter-of-factly, “You’re her fourth uncle. It’s only right for her to tell you the truth!” ”

“Mother!”Lin Qingxuan could not stand it anymore. “Why can’t you treat burning as your biological granddaughter?”

“”Do you think she treats me as her biological grandmother? I’ve been back for so many days, yet she hasn’t come to visit me once! It’s fine if she doesn’t come herself, but she even brought Ah Ze to not visit me!” ”

The wild girl was indeed a wild girl. She had no manners at all.

“As soon as she finished speaking, old madam Lin continued, “I only acknowledge Xianxian as my biological granddaughter! Only Xianxian is my biological granddaughter!” ”

“”Have you ever thought about why you would treat you this way? Because from the start, you never treated her as your biological granddaughter!” Lin Qingxuan continued, “Mother, don’t even think about marrying off burning! This isn’t something you should be concerned about!” ”

“These words thoroughly angered Old Mrs. Lin. “This is not my business? She is my granddaughter! As a grandmother, can’t I decide her life’s matters?” ”

She was the old Mrs. Lin of the Lin family.

“As long as she did not close her eyes, everything in the Lin family had to be decided by her! ”

She had to get the eyesore mother and daughter out of the house as soon as possible and give Feng Qianhua and Feng Xianxian space.

It had been twenty-one years.

“His mother was still the same as before, Bossy and arbitrary. She never considered the opinions of others before doing anything. ”

“Lin Qingxuan massaged her temples and suddenly felt very tired, “If you still want to acknowledge Jin Cheng as your son and make Jin Cheng Call You Mother, you should not interfere in the burning matter. Otherwise, you might lose Jin Cheng Forever.” ”

“Old Madam Lin was stunned, and a wave of anger rose from the bottom of her heart. However, when she thought of Lin Qingxuan’s encounter just now, she forcefully suppressed this nameless anger. ”

“No matter what, she had indeed let Lin Qingxuan down after what happened to Zhao shuning. ”

Old Madam Lin turned to look at Lin Qingxuan. “You should go back and rest first.”

Lin Qingxuan nodded and turned to walk towards the north courtyard.

“Aunt Zhang immediately went forward to support old madam Lin. “Old Madam, let me help you to rest, okay?” ”

“Okay.”

“After Old Madam Lin went to rest, Aunt Zhang immediately called Feng Qianhua and told her about Zhao shuning. ”

Feng Qianhua was immediately stunned.

She didn’t expect that Lin Qingxuan would discover this matter so quickly.

“Can you tell me what’s Going On?”

“According to her understanding of Lin Qingxuan, Lin Qingxuan would never suspect this matter for no reason. If he had suspected Zhao shuning, he wouldn’t have waited until today. ”

“Aunt Zhang looked around and said in a low voice, “It’s related to ye Zao.” ”

“Ye Zao?”

“”Yes,”aunt Zhang continued, “Lin Qingxuan told the old lady himself. He also advised the old lady not to get involved in ye Zao’s matter.” ”

There was silence on the other end of the phone.

Feng Qianhua frowned.

She could not help but think of the Zhao and Li families.

“Zhao Shuqi was fired because he wanted to change ye Zao’s name, and Li Yibiao went bankrupt because he wanted to marry ye Zao. ”

“Was all of this just a coincidence, or was it because someone was behind it? ”

“Ye Zao was only a 19-year-old girl. She had just entered university, how could she have such ability? ”

“After a while, Feng Qianhua continued, “Please help me pay more attention to ye Zao during this period of time. If there are any abnormalities, remember to call me.” ”

“Okay.”

...

East Wing.

Ye Zao sat in front of the computer desk and replied to the message.

“Li Shang: [ President Ye, YC has signed a contract with our company for a very long time. So far, we have not carried any live broadcasts. Recently, a lot of big partners are hoping to get YC to endorse them. Can the company help YC take on these few endorsements? ] ” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“After all, Sitara YC’s Ye was personally signed by President Ye, whom Li Shang had never met before. Therefore, Li Shang still felt that this kind of thing had to be approved by President Ye. ”
