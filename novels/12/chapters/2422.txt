“However, the exotic beasts all became extremely abnormal. ”

They roared and roared.

Bang Bang Bang —

“Following that, they all fell to the ground. ”

“Seeing the exotic beasts finally fall to the ground, everyone cheered excitedly. ”

This scene before them was something that they didn’t even dare to dream of.

“Mario and William looked at each other, their eyes filled with tears. ”

Not long after.

The aircraft no longer threw smoke bombs.

“The thick smoke in the air gradually disappeared, and the bodies of the beasts that had fallen to the ground gradually shrank. ”

“From the size of an elephant to the size of a horse, then to the size of a sparrow, and finally to a single-celled organism that was invisible to the naked eye. ”

“With the disappearance of the beasts, the peace of L continent returned to its former state. ”

“When everyone saw this scene, they cheered on the spot. ”

Rumble —

“It was also at this moment that the aircraft, which had been hovering in mid-air, landed. ”

“When everyone saw the aircraft, they immediately made way for it. ” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Mario and William went forward and stood in front of the aircraft.

“Before long, the door of the aircraft was opened. ”

Worker Xu walked out from inside.

“Mario immediately extended his hand towards worker Xu. “Hello, worker Xu. I’m Mario.” ”

“Hello.”Worker Xu shook hands with Mario.

“After saying that, worker Xu continued, “Mr. Mario, currently, all the exotic beasts in L continent have been destroyed. I’ll leave the rest of the work to you.” ”

“Thank you.”Mario bowed.

“William couldn’t wait to ask, “Where’s Miss Ye?” ”

He wanted to thank ye Zhuo in front of ye Zhuo.

Worker Xu looked at William. “Miss Ye has been working in the laboratory for more than 48 hours to research the virus that can conquer exotic beasts. She’s resting now.”

“A day was 24 hours, and 48 hours was two days. ”

“Hearing this, William felt very ashamed. ”

“Ye Zao had sacrificed so much for L continent, and he had even suspected that ye Zao was lying to him. ”

He really shouldn’t have done that.

“Worker Xu continued, “Miss Ye has another sentence for me to pass on to you.” ”

“”Please say it quickly,”Mario said. ”

“Worker Xu turned to look at Mario and continued, “Miss ye said that no matter what happened in the past, the past is already in the past. A person should look forward. Whether l continent can return to its former glory will depend on the two of you.” ”

“After hearing these words, Mario felt a myriad of emotions in his heart. ”

“It had to be said that not only was ye Zao talented, he was also meticulous. ”

“If it was someone else, they might not be able to care so much. ”

“However, Ye Zao was different. ”

Ye Zao had thought of everything.

Regardless of whether it would happen or not.

“”Alright.”Mario nodded. “Please rest assured, Miss Ye. We will definitely not disappoint her.” ”

“”En.”Worker Xu took out a document. “And this, this is what Miss ye asked me to pass to you.” ”

Mario received the document from worker Xu with both hands.

“Worker Xu continued, “Then I’ll go back and hand in the task for Miss Ye.” ”

Mario sent worker Xu to the aircraft.

The people of L continent watched as the aircraft disappeared into the horizon. All of them spontaneously performed the highest etiquette of L continent.

“In this era, they should all remember that there was a heroine named Ye Zhuo. ”

...

The news that the exotic beasts of L continent had been completely destroyed soon spread all over the world.

Who could believe that those exotic beasts without any weaknesses had actually been destroyed by Ye Zhuo!

“For a time, the headlines all over the world were all about the exotic beasts of L continent. ”

[ Miss Ye is still Miss Ye! ]

[ miss ye Yds! ]

[ miss ye can really ascend to godhood directly. ]

“[ as far as I know, Miss Ye has long been recorded in the world’s Hall of Fame, and she’s ranked first! Not to mention ancient times, in modern times, Miss Ye is also an existence that has ascended to godhood. ] ”

“[ looking at Miss ye every day, I often feel that I’m a waste! ] ”

“After finishing everything, Ye Zhuo planned to have a good rest for a period of time. ”

“During this period of time, her nerves were too tense. ”

“She stood in front of the experiment table and completed the last step. She turned to look at the person beside her and said, “Worker Xu, I’ll leave the rest to you.” ”

“Worker xu smiled and said, “Okay, Miss Ye.” ”

“”Then I’ll go out first,”ye Zhuo continued. ”

“Okay.”Worker Xu nodded. “You can go.”

“Ye Zhuo took off her lab coat and walked out of the door. As soon as she reached the door, Cen Shaoqing took her lab coat and said, “Shall we go on vacation?” ”

“Coincidentally, Ye Zhuo also wanted to relax. “Where are we going?” ”

“To the South China Sea?”Cen Shaoqing said.
