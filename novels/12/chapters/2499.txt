Yu Luonian was very confident in himself.

He was even more confident in Xian ‘er.

He knew Xian ‘Er’s personality too well.

“As long as ye Zhuo agreed, then Cen Shaoqing would definitely wear this female outfit. ”

“At the end of his speech, Yu Luonian looked at ye Zhuo and asked, “Sister-in-law, do you dare?” ”

“Why not?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly.

“”Good! Sister-in-law is indeed courageous!”Yu Luonian continued, “However, words have no basis. Let’s make a written pledge!” ”

It was said that a gentleman’s word was hard to go back on.

“However, Ye Zhuo was a girl after all. In the absence of a written pledge, what if she did not admit her debt? ”

“Therefore, a written pledge must be made! ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

Yu Luonian turned to look at his assistant behind him. “Xiao Zhang.”

“His assistant, Little Zhang, immediately understood and nodded. “Yes, boss. Please wait a moment.” ”

Little Zhang immediately turned around to sign the document.

“A moment later, Little Zhang came over with the printed document. “Boss.” ”

“Yu Niannian took the document and nodded in satisfaction. Then, she turned to look at Ye Zhuo. “Sister-in-law?” ”

“Ye Zhuo walked over and took the document. After taking a glance at it, he picked up the pen at the side and signed his name just like that. ”

Her handwriting was swift.

“It was very forceful. Although it was only two words, it still showed that her handwriting was extraordinary. ”

“Yu Luonian had practiced calligraphy for a period of time, so she naturally knew that everyone was a martial artist. She smiled and said, “It’s true to say that one’s handwriting is as good as one’s own.” ”

“”Thank you.”Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Your handwriting is also very good.” ”

“”I’ve practiced for more than twenty years,”Yu Luonian said. ”

“Ye Zao said, “It’s about the same for me.” ”

“Yu Mumu put away the signed receipt. “Sister-in-law, since you’ve already made a written receipt, you can’t go back on your word.” ”

“A gentleman’s word.”Ye Zao’s tone was shallow.

Yu Mumu smiled faintly. “But you’re a woman.”

“The sentence that he had heard the most was, “You believe the words of a woman?”? ”

“Ye Zao turned his eyes slightly. “Sexism is not good. Don’t worry, I never embarrass girls. I hope you do the same.” ”

“Yu sunset said, “Regardless of who wins or loses, I, Yu, will never go back on my word.” ”

“Furthermore, he would definitely win this bet! ”

Yu sunset was looking forward to Cen Shaoqing’s reaction when he saw this letter.

“When that time came, Cen Shaoqing’s expression would definitely be very interesting. ”

Ye Zhuo smiled. “Okay.”

“After signing the letter, Ye Zhuo returned to his seat and continued eating breakfast. ”

“In his twilight years, he took out his cell phone and sent a wechat message to Xian ‘er. ”

“Then, he showed an “He knew it”expression. ”

Xian ‘er did not blacklist him. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

He thought that Xian ‘er would put on a good show.

“Unexpectedly, Xian ‘er did not even have the courage to blacklist him. ”

“But thinking about it, it made sense. ”

The risk of blacklisting him was too great.

“What if after Xian ‘er blacklisted him, he got angry and did not add Xian ‘er again? ”

Xian ‘er was not too stupid. She knew that she could not go too far.

[ have you eaten? ]? This was a wechat message sent to Xian ‘er by old man Yu.

“Xian ‘er replied very quickly, [ I’ve arrived home safely. Young Master Yu, we’ll still be friends if we see each other again. ] ”

Old Man Yu did not reply again.

The hidden meaning in Xian ‘er’s words was very obvious. They were all adults. It would be bad if some words were directly said.

“Putting down the phone, Yu sunset looked up at Ye Zao with a smile in his eyes. “Sister-in-law.” ”

“Oh?”Ye Zao looked up slightly.

“Yu sunset continued, “Do you believe it or not? You’re going to lose this time.” ”

“”I don’t believe it,”ye Zao said. ”

“You don’t believe it?”Yu sunset raised his eyebrows.

“Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Yes, I don’t believe it.” ”

“Yu sunset smiled and said, “Do you know that I’m already starting to worry about your situation?” ”

It was true that Cen Shaoqing loved ye Zao very much.

“However, this kind of love did not include ye Zao challenging his bottom line. ”

How was it possible for CEN Shaoqing to dance in women’s clothes in front of everyone? !

“”Worry about me?”Ye Zao laughed softly. “If you have time to worry about me, you should worry about yourself. A man’s words and deeds must be followed. I hope you can smile so happily when the time comes.” ”

Ye Zhuo believed in Xian ‘er.

It was true that Xian ‘er had been a canary in her twilight years.

But this did not mean that Xian ‘er had no bottom line.

“The person in the deep mud was not that he did not want to come out, but that he lacked a ferryman. ”

“From Xian ‘ER’s eyes, it could be seen that she was a person who yearned to rely on herself. ”

“The smile on the corner of Yu Luonian’s mouth could not be dispelled. He continued, “I have never seen Zixu wearing women’s clothing.” ”

“”What a coincidence,”ye Zhuo said faintly, “I think he must have never seen you wear it.” ”
