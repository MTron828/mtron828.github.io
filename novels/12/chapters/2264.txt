Rely on your parents at home and your friends when you go out.

“For some reason, Bai Jingshu suddenly felt a little sad when she heard this. ”

She couldn’t rely on her parents anymore.

“Bai Jingshu looked up at the Lin family’s parents, then at Lin Ze and ye Zao, the two siblings. She felt a little envious in her heart. ”

This was a real family.

Unlike their family.

Everyone had their own plot in their hearts.

“One day you schemed against me, and the next day I schemed against you. ”

“Even between biological sisters, there was no stopping the scheming. ”

This was also why Bai Jingshu liked Earth so much.

“Although there was mutual deception in every place, on Earth, relatives and relatives would at least not scheme against each other. ”

“”Jingshu, what are you waiting for? Is it because Auntie’s breakfast doesn’t suit your taste?”Seeing that Bai Jingshu didn’t move her chopsticks for a long time.., ye Shu suddenly remembered that most people in the s galaxy drank nutrient fluids. For example, Shi Qingcheng had been on Earth for a week before she could get used to eating. Thinking of this, Ye Shu immediately stood up and said, “I’m sorry, it’s my fault. I’ll go get you some nutrient fluids now!” ”

“The Lin family had prepared a lot of nutrient fluids. Sometimes, Ye Shu was too busy with work to eat, so she would drink a jar of nutrient fluids instead. ”

“Hearing Ye Shu’s voice, Bai Jingshu finally reacted. “Auntie, don’t be so busy. I actually don’t like drinking nutrient fluids. Your Breakfast is very good. It looks very appetizing!” ”

“”Then Jingshu, don’t stand on ceremony. The nutrient fluids are all ready-made at home,”ye Shu said. “If you’re not used to it, I’ll go get it for you.” ”

“”Auntie, I’m not standing on ceremony. I really don’t like nutrient solutions.”As she spoke, Bai Jingshu picked up a bun. ”

“She didn’t know what Bai Jingshu’s taste was, so ye Shu prepared a chinese-style breakfast and a western-style breakfast. ”

“The chinese-style breakfast consisted of soy milk buns, deep-fried dough sticks, and pickled vegetables. ”

“The western-style breakfast consisted of a sandwich, ham, fruit juice, and a vegetable salad. ”

“Bai Jingshu liked eating steamed buns very much. She took a bite and said in surprise, “This steamed bun is delicious. Did you make it, Auntie?” ”

“”Yes.”Ye Shu nodded. “I made it at home when I had nothing to do. Also, this Shumai is not bad. Take it and try it.” ”

“”Thank you, Auntie.”Bai Jingshu took the shumai that ye Shu handed over. ”

How should she put it.

Ye Shu had a good impression of Bai Jingshu.

She felt that this little girl did not put on any airs and was very amiable. She did not look like anyone else in the s galaxy at all.

“Most importantly, this was Lin Ze’s first female friend. ”

What if this little girl could become her daughter-in-law in the future?

It was said that mother-in-law and daughter-in-law relationships were the most difficult relationships in the world to handle. She had to build a good relationship with her future daughter-in-law in advance. She could not become a negative example.

“In order to not make Bai Jingshu feel awkward.., lin Jincheng hurriedly finished his breakfast and said, “You guys eat. I’m going to work. Miss Bai, you can stay at home for a few more days. If there’s anything, you can look for Ah Ze to handle! Don’t stand on ceremony!” ”

“”Okay. Take care, uncle.”Bai Jingshu stood up and said. ”

“”Sit down, sit down. We’re not outsiders.”Lin Jincheng turned to look at Lin Ze. “Don’t neglect Miss Bai.” ”

“Okay.”Lin Ze nodded.

“With that, Lin Jincheng picked up his coat from the hanger and walked out while putting on his coat. ”

“Under ye Shu’s warm hospitality, Bai Jingshu ate twice as much breakfast as usual. ”

“In the end, Lin Ze stood up to help Bai Jingshu out. “Mom, she can’t eat that much.” ”

“Bai Jingshu continued, “Yes, Auntie. I’m too full.” ”

“”Okay.”Ye Shu put down the ham slices in her hand. “Jingshu, Aunty, I’ll say it again. Treat this place as your home. Don’t stand on ceremony.” ”

“Okay.”Bai Jing nodded.

“Ye Zhuo finished the last dessert and said with a smile, “Jingshu, I’m going to school. I hope you have a good time.” ” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Go to school?”Bai Jingshu was stunned.

She didn’t expect ye Zhuo to still be in school.

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “I have an experiment today. I’ll be leaving first.”

“”Okay, drive slowly on the road,”Bai Jingshu said. ”

“Ye Zhuo greeted ye Shu and Lin Ze before turning to leave. At this moment, ye Shu seemed to have thought of something and continued, “Have Yueyue come over for dinner tonight.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded.

“After ye Zhuo left, Ye Shu also had to go to work. ”

“Before she left, Ye Shu repeatedly told Lin Ze to treat BAI Jingshu well. ”

Lin Ze nodded.

Ye Shu spoke to Bai Jingshu for a few more words before turning to leave.
