Translator: 549690339

“Bring me to take a look.”Ye Zhuo stood up from his chair.

Director Han was stunned.

Did Ye Zhuo agree to this?

“At that moment, director Han did not dare to delay any further. He immediately stood up and said, “Miss Ye, come with me.” ”

Ye Zhuo followed director Han’s footsteps.

“Because he had been informed in advance, the attending physician had waited in the corridor of the ward in advance. ”

“Director Han took the initiative to introduce, “Miss Ye, this is the patient’s attending physician, Wu Wenqiang. Doctor Wu, this is Miss Ye!” ”

The name “Miss Ye”had long resounded throughout the entire medical world.

“Wu Wenqiang admired ye Zhuo very much. He had seen ye Zhuo on television once before, but he did not expect to see him in person today. ”

“”Hello, Miss Ye. I’m Wu Wenqiang.”Doctor Wu extended his hand to Ye Zhuo. ”

Ye Zao shook his hand. “Doctor Wu.”

“Doctor Wu continued, “The patient’s ward is right in front. Please follow me.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly and followed Doctor Wu’s footsteps.

“The patient had not been diagnosed with the specific cause of the illness, so he could only stay in a separate ward. ”

“Before entering the ward, Doctor Wu gave ye Zao a medical mask. ”

Ye Zao took it and put it on.

Doctor Wu knocked on the door.

A weak reply came from inside.

“Come in.”

Doctor Wu pushed the door open and entered.

“As soon as he entered, he saw a 15-16-year-old little girl lying on the bed. ”

“Her facial features were very delicate, like a beautiful Barbie doll in the window. ”

Especially her eyes.

“While she was very beautiful, she also exuded a weak aura. ”

“Doctor Wu bent down and looked into the little girl’s eyes. “Weiwei, this is Miracle Doctor Ye. You’ll definitely be fine with her around.” ”

“Weiwei.”Ye Zao bent down slightly and greeted the little girl.

The little girl looked at Ye Zao. “Are you the Miracle Doctor Ye who cured cancer?”

Ye Zao was wearing a mask.

“The expression on his face could not be seen clearly. His pair of beautiful eyes seemed to be filled with stars, causing the little girl to be slightly dazed for a moment. ”

Her family had always thought that she was very beautiful.

Only after seeing ye Zao today did they know what it meant to be out of the world.

This was what was truly beautiful! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Even a mask could not hide her temperament and beauty.

“”I am.”Ye Zao nodded slightly and continued, “Vivi, stretch out your hand. I will take your pulse.” ”

Take your pulse?

Vivi was stunned for a moment.

“She felt that this term was a little strange, as if she had only heard of it in ancient costume dramas. ”

“Seeing that Vivi did not respond for a long time, doctor Wu reminded her in a low voice, “Vivi, show me your hand quickly.” ”

“OH.”Vivi immediately stretched out her hand.

Ye Zao put his hand on her wrist and focused on listening to her pulse.

“She narrowed her eyes slightly, and her long and thick eyelashes cast a shallow shadow on her lower eyelids. ”

“A moment later, ye Zao let go of Vivi’s hand. ”

“Vivi asked, “Miracle Doctor Ye, am I not going to die?” ”

“After saying that, Vivi continued, “They all say that my illness is worse than cancer. I know, I’m definitely going to die!” ”

“Vivi had been sick for a long time, and she had long seen through life and death. ”

“In fact, sometimes, rather than living in pain, it was better to die quickly. ”

Ye Zao looked back slightly. “You won’t die.”

Weiwei did not take ye Zao’s words to heart

“But beside her, doctor Wu was ecstatic. ”

He knew that ye Zao was not comforting Weiwei. She had really found the cause of the illness!

“Otherwise, ye Zao would never have said such things. ”

“Weiwei smiled and said, “It doesn’t matter! People will die anyway.” ”

“Ye Zhuo did not respond. He turned to look at doctor Wu and said, “Give me a pen and paper.” ”

Doctor Wu immediately took out the notebook from his pocket and handed it to Ye Zhuo along with the black pen.

Ye Zhuo reached out to take it and then wrote something on the notebook.

“About three minutes later, he returned the notebook to Doctor Wu. “Go and check according to the items on it. After the check, send me the report.” ”

Doctor Wu took the notebook and a look of surprise flashed across his eyes.

It was a very pleasing word.

“After a moment, doctor Wu nodded. “Yes, Miss Ye.” ”

Ye Zhuo turned to look at Weiwei. “Are you avoiding food again?”

“Yes.”Weiwei nodded.

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “From now on, you don’t have to avoid food anymore.” ”

“Hearing this, Weiwei widened her eyes and said excitedly, “Really?” ”

“”Of course it’s true,”ye Zao said. ”

“Weiwei then asked, “Then can I drink milk tea and eat spicy hot soup?” ”

Milk Tea?

Spicy hot soup?

The eating habits of young people nowadays were too unhealthy!

Doctor Wu frowned slightly.

“They were still in the hospital, yet they were already thinking of eating these things! ”

Ye Zao smiled and nodded. “You can eat them in moderation.”
