Translator: 549690339

Feng Ying suddenly felt very sorry for the old lady.

“The old lady loved her dearly, but after she got the Jade, she was going to leave the old lady. ”

“The old lady was already eighty-nine years old this year. If she left, how would the old lady live in the future? ”

Was she going to give up the chance to go to C Nation

No!

No!

Joining the International Fashion Department and becoming a manager was Feng Ying’s lifelong dream.

She could not abandon her dream because of an old lady.

The old lady was already old. How many years could an eighty-nine-year-old old man live?

But she was different!

She was only in her early thirties this year. She could not ruin her bright future just because of an old man who was about to die.

There was nowhere to hide from the rain if she missed the temple gate.

“If she missed this opportunity to join the International Fashion Department and become a manager, she might not have this opportunity again in the future. ”

“Therefore, she was determined to get the plain jade! ”

She could not be blamed for this.

The only one to blame was the old lady herself.

It was not that she did not want to bring the old lady to enjoy life in C country. It was the old lady herself who did not want to go.

“If a cow did not drink water, how could she force her head down? ”

“Since the old lady had her own choice, then whether the old lady lived or died in the future would have nothing to do with her! ”

“Thinking of this, Feng Ying heaved a sigh of relief, and the burden on her heart lightened quite a bit. ”

“At this moment, the old lady’s voice sounded in the air. “Xiao Ying, what are you still standing there for? Hurry up and eat the longevity noodles!”! ”

“Okay!”Feng Ying picked up her chopsticks and took a bite of the instant noodles. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

It was still the same as she remembered.

It was very delicious.

“After eating two bites of instant noodles, Feng Ying picked up some food for the old lady. ”

“The grandfather and grandson chatted as they ate. The meal was about to be finished, but the old lady still did not take out the plain jade. She did not even mention anything about the plain jade. ”

What was going on?

Did the old lady regret it?

“It was clearly a deal, how could she go back on her words! ”

Feng Ying frowned slightly.

“Grandma...”Feng Ying turned to look at the old lady.

“What is it?”The old lady looked at Feng Ying.

“Feng Ying hesitated for a moment and then said, “Grandma, didn’t You Promise Me a gift yesterday?” ”

“The old lady smiled and said, “So that’s what you’re talking about! Wait! Grandma will go get it for you now!” ”

“Feng Ying’s eyes lit up when she heard that. She immediately stood up from the chair and said, “Grandma, I’ll go with you.” ”

“”No, no.”The old lady waved her hand and said, “Just sit here and wait for me. I’ll go downstairs right away.” ”

“Okay.”Feng Ying nodded and looked at the old lady’s back view as she went upstairs. She was very excited.

This was great!

“Soon, she would have the plain jade. ”

“Under Feng Ying’s expectant gaze, the old lady finally came to the dining room with a box. ”

Yes.

It was that box.

Feng Ying stared at the wooden box in the old lady’s hand.

“The old lady walked to the dining table and sat down. Feng Ying stood up and reached out to take the wooden box. “Thank you, grandmother, for your birthday present.” ”

The old lady reached out to press the wooden box. “Wait a minute.”

“”What’s wrong, grandmother?”Feng Ying looked at the old lady in confusion. ”

“The old lady continued, “Let’s have a toast first. Suyu is right here, and she can’t run away! Why are you in such a hurry?” ”

“Okay!”Feng Ying nodded.

“She was about to leave China, and it was normal for her to stay here alone with the old lady. Before she left, it was normal for her to have a drink with the old lady. ”

“Feng Ying was a little sad when she thought about how the old lady would be alone from now on, but when she thought about how the old lady did it herself, she was not sad anymore! ”

“If the old lady really could not bear to part with her granddaughter, she could have followed her to C nation. ”

But the old lady did not.

This meant that the old lady did not think much of her granddaughter.

“The old lady picked up the wine that she had prepared earlier and poured two cups. She handed Feng Ying a cup and said, “Xiao Ying, this is for you.” ”

“Under the Bright Crystal Light, the pink liquid sparkled in the transparent goblet. It looked exceptionally beautiful. ”

“”Thank you, Grandma.”Feng Ying took the wine cup and asked curiously, “Grandma, what kind of wine is this? The color is really good!” ”

“”It’s plum wine. I brewed it myself,”the old lady said. ”

“It must be delicious!”Feng Ying said with a smile.

“The old lady nodded. “The taste is really good. If you like it, you can drink more. Come, let’s toast. Xiao Ying, Happy Birthday to you.” ”

“Feng Ying immediately clinked the glass with the old lady. “Thank you, Grandma.” ”

The old lady downed the plum wine in one gulp.
