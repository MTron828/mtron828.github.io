“At this moment, the joy in Auntie Lang’s heart could not be described with words. ”

Thirty-six years.

A whole thirty-six years.

“Now that she had finally received news of her biological daughter, Auntie Lang was so excited that she was in a daze. She was afraid that she had misheard and confirmed it with Xi Weiyue again, “Weiyue, is what you said true? is little half moon really by your side now? has your father really found Little Half Moon?” ”

“XI weiyue said, “It’s true! Of course it’s true. Aunt, Hurry back now! When you come back, you’ll be able to see Little Half Moon.” ”

“O-okay.”Aunt Lang’s voice was close to choking. “I’ll be back right away...”

“Aunt Lang hung up the phone and looked up at Cen Shaoqing and Ye Zhuo. She was so excited that she was incoherent. “Young, Shaoqing, I, I, I, I, I have found them. I’ll go back first. You, you, and...” ”

“Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads. “Aunt Lang, Congratulations. You’ve waited for so many years and finally found your daughter! You should go back quickly. Don’t mind us.” ”

“Ye Zhuo was also happy for Aunt Lang. “Yes, Aunt Lang, you should go back quickly.” ”

Aunt Lang did not even have the time to change into her apron before she called the chauffeur and left.

“Looking at Aunt Lang’s hurried back, Ye Zhuo turned to Cen Shaoqing and sighed. “Aunt Lang has finally found half a month.” ”

The mother and daughter had been separated from each other for thirty-six years. It was really not easy for them to be reunited at this time. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “That’s right. Aunt Lang doesn’t have to live in pain and guilt every day from now on.”Over the years, although Aunt Lang did not say anything, anyone could tell, aunt Lang blamed herself for the loss of half a month. ”

She lived in great pain every day.

“At this moment, a crisp ringtone sounded in the air. ”

Cen Shaoqing picked up the phone and opened his thin lips. “Hello.”

“”Okay, I got it.” ”

“After hanging up, Cen Shaoqing tilted his head and looked at Ye Zhuo. “Will you accompany me to the experimental base?” ”

“Sure.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

...

On the other side.

“Aunt Lang was sitting in the co-pilot’s seat. Her gaze was anxious as she looked ahead. She tilted her head and urged the driver, “Xiao Li, drive faster.” ”

“Xiao Li smiled and said, “Aunt Lang, I’m already going as fast as I can. If I go any faster, I’ll be like a plane!” ”

Aunt Lang was stunned. “This is already the fastest?”Why did she feel that the speed was so slow?

“”That’s right!”Xiao Li nodded and continued, “Don’t be anxious. If there’s no traffic jam, we’ll be there in half an hour.” ”

Aunt Lang was very anxious.

She wished she could speed up the car by ten times.

She wanted to see little half a month immediately.

“Not to mention half an hour, she couldn’t even wait for a minute now. ”

Thirty-six years.

She wondered what her little half a month had become?

Did she still recognize her as a mother?

“Perhaps little half a month had already gotten married and had children, and as a mother, not only did she not witness her daughter’s wedding, she didn’t even attend her daughter’s growth. ”

She was not a good mother.

“The more Aunt Lang thought about it, the more uncomfortable she felt. Tears rolled down her face, and her throat felt stiff. ”

“When Xiao Li saw Aunt Lang like this, he felt very uncomfortable. He handed Aunt Lang a piece of tissue. “Aunt Lang, don’t cry. Haven’t we already found her half a month ago?” ”

Aunt Lang took the tissue and wiped the tears off her face.

“Half an hour later, the car arrived at the Xi family’s villa. ”

“As soon as the car stopped, Aunt Lang could not wait to open the car door and run out. She was too excited. As soon as she got out of the car, she stumbled a few steps and almost fell. ”

“Fortunately, Xi Weiyue ran over and quickly held Aunt Lang. “Aunt, be careful.” ”

“Aunt Lang held Xi Weiyue’s hand tightly and asked impatiently, “Weiyue, where’s Little Half Moon? is little half moon really back?” ”

“XI weiyue smiled and said, “It’s true! My dad found Sister Half Moon. Sister Half Moon is in the house now. Please come in with me.” ”

“MMM.”Aunt Lang walked into the house hurriedly. “Where did your dad find Little Half Moon? When did he find Little Half Moon? Has Little Half Moon been living well all these years?”

“Xi Weiyue held Aunt Lang as they walked in and said softly, “Aunty, although my dad found Sister Half Moon, Sister Half Moon’s condition is not very good. You have to be mentally prepared.” ”

Not in a good state?

“Aunt Lang’s heart skipped a beat. “Weiyue, what do you mean? Did something happen to Banyue?” ”

“Xi Weiyue hesitated, then, she said, “Back then, Sister Banyue was kidnapped by human traffickers. She suffered a lot in the process, which caused her to be in a daze. She needs someone to take care of her clothes, food, shelter, and transportation. She’s only about the IQ of a three-year-old child.” ”
