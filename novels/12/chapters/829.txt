Now only hackers could find out.

“Cao Wei consulted a few hackers who often worked with him, but the results were not good. ”

“At this moment, he thought of Baron. ”

Baron was a famous hacker abroad.

“As long as Baron was willing to help, he would definitely be able to find out the real information about this YC’s Ye. ” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Cao Wei immediately called Baron.

Baron quickly picked up.

“After hearing that Baron was also in Beijing, Cao Wei continued, “It’s not convenient to talk over the phone, let’s meet and talk.” ”

“Sure.”

The two of them arranged to meet at a nearby coffee shop.

“Cao Wei had a favor to ask, so he came to the coffee shop early. ”

Baron also arrived as promised.

“Baron was a blonde Chinese with blue eyes. His facial features were very three-dimensional, and he was very young. He looked like he was only twenty-five or twenty-six years old. ”

He wore a white t-shirt on top and a pair of cropped pants on the bottom. He wore a black cap on his head and held a skateboard in his hands. He looked very energetic and did not look like a hacker at all.

“Mr. Cao.”

“”Baron.”Cao Wei stood up from his chair. “Before I made the call, I was worried that you were not in China.” ”

“I just happened to come to China to settle an important matter.”

Cao Wei nodded. “Have a seat.”

Baron sat opposite Cao Wei.

Cao Wei passed the wine list to Baron.

Baron ordered a cup of coffee.

“Cao Wei continued, “May I know why Mr. Baron has come to Beijing? “I grew up in Beijing and was born and raised in Beijing. I’m very familiar with Beijing. If there’s anything I can help you with, please feel free to ask, Mr. Baron.” ”

“Baron hesitated for a moment before continuing, “Actually, I’m here to look for someone.” ”

Look for someone?

“Hearing this, Cao Wei smiled and said, “What a coincidence! I’m Looking for you today to look for someone. May I know who you’re looking for?” ”

“Baron said, “I’m looking for a hacker.” ”

A hacker?

Baron was a hacker himself and he was looking for another hacker.

This meant that the other party was definitely not powerful.

“Cao Wei then asked, “A hacker from Beijing?” ”

“Yes.”Baron nodded.

“As a world-famous hacker, Baron had a person that he admired very much. ”

This person was the new dark horse in the industry.

Z.

“Previously, Z had become famous in one battle on an international website. ”

“Later, the founder of the Hacker Alliance, Fat Cat, had contacted z many times, hoping that z could join them and promised a generous commission. ”

“However, Z rejected all of them. ”

“Baron was a person who would not admit defeat. He felt that no one’s hacking skills could surpass his, so he sent a PK to Z. ”

“In the end, before the PK started. ”

His computer was hacked three times.

“Later, he fought with z many times on international websites. It was not easy for him to find out that the IP address of Z was in Beijing. Although he found out that Z had logged in in Beijing, he could not trace the specific address. ”

“Therefore, Baron bought a plane ticket overnight and flew to the center of Beijing. ”

This was the first time Baron worshipped a person so much. It was also the first time Baron stepped onto the road of searching for someone he did not know.

He had already been in Beijing for a week.

Unfortunately.

He still could not find z.

“Cao Wei said in surprise, “There are hackers in Beijing too?” ”

“It was not that Cao Wei was a foreign man, but that the domestic computer technology was far inferior to that of foreign countries. ”

The Hacker Alliance had a total of 130 members.

Only three of them were Chinese.

This data could explain everything.

“Therefore, when he heard that Baron came to Beijing to look for hackers, Cao Wei was so surprised. He then asked, “Is he Chinese? Is He very powerful?” ”

“”He’s a very powerful boss. I’m not very sure if he’s Chinese,”Baron tried to be tactful. “I only found out that his IP address is in Beijing.” ”

Z could be Chinese?

How was that possible!

“In their eyes, China was just a little brother. There were very few hackers in the real sense. ”

Z was the Dark Horse of the hacker world. He had conquered almost all the hackers in the hacker world.

Such a mysterious person was definitely from C nation.

Many hackers were afraid of exposing themselves and would hide abroad.

“OH.”Cao Wei nodded.

“Baron continued, “Right, who do you want me to help you investigate?” ”

“An anchor.”Cao Wei handed the phone to Baron.

“Baron took the phone and frowned slightly. “It’s just an anchor. Mr. Cao, can you just randomly find someone to investigate?”Baron did not accept all kinds of jobs. He liked those that were difficult and challenging. ”

Finding someone was not difficult at all for him.

Cao Wei smiled and saw the meaning in Baron’s eyes. “This live streamer is not a simple person.”

“What do you mean?”Baron asked.

“Cao Wei took a sip of coffee and continued, “Her information is encrypted. I’ve asked people to check for a long time, but they still couldn’t find out her real information.” ”

“”Encrypted?”This time, Baron’s interest was piqued. ”

Hacking the database was still very exciting.

Especially the Chinese database.

“Cao Wei nodded. “Yes, that’s why I want to ask you for a favor.” ”

“”Give me 10 minutes,”Baron said. ”

“Cao Wei was stunned. “You, you want to check now?” ”

“”Yes.”Baron nodded, not appreciating this at all. ”

It was just hacking into a database. It was nothing to Baron.

Ten minutes was just a conservative number.

He could be even faster!

Cao Wei thought that he would need three to five days to search for information like those anonymous hackers in China?

It was ridiculous!

He was Baron!

How could those nobodies in China compare to him?

“If it wasn’t for Z, he wouldn’t have come to such a backward country like China. ”
