“Ye Zhuo leaned over and sat opposite Li Shang. He smiled and said, “Uncle Li, how many times have I told you? You Don’t have to call me CEO Ye. Just call me by my name.” ”

“Li Shang said, “How can I Do That!” ”

“Although ye Zhuo was relatively young, Li Shang had never treated ye Zhuo as a little girl. ”

“A superior was a superior, and a leader was a leader. ”

“Moreover, ye Zao had never behaved like a teenager. ”

“Since Li Shang was like this, Ye Zao did not force him. He continued, “By the way, Uncle Li, why are you looking for me?” ”

“Li Shang took out a document. “Recently, there is a variety show called ‘life in the country’that wants to invite you to participate.” ”

“Variety show?”Ye Zao’s eyes were indifferent. He reached out to take the document and casually flipped through a few pages.

“From the lack of interest on his face, it was obvious that he was not interested in this variety show. ”

“After all, when this person was broadcasting live, he did not even want to show his face. ”

“Asking her to participate in a variety show, wasn’t this a joke? ”

“Li Shang knew it in his heart, but he still hoped that ye Zao could participate, he then said, “President Ye, although our company is currently in an explosive phase, we still need popularity and promotion. Once you participate in this program, not only can we save a huge amount of endorsement fees, but we can also increase the company’s popularity. It’s a good thing to kill two birds with one stone. Do you want to consider it?” ”

This was equivalent to advertising for the company for free...

It was still very cost-effective.

“Ye Zhuo had recently donated a large sum of money to a poor mountain village anonymously, and he had previously given Lin Jin city a black card. ”

He was indeed quite short of money now.

If he saved the endorsement fee to buy desserts.

It seemed to be not bad.

Ye Zhuo narrowed his eyes.

“After that.., li Shang continued, “Moreover, this ‘brave torrent into the countryside’variety show is different from other shows. It’s said that this show doesn’t have a script or lines, so it’s rather interesting. Just treat it as a tour.” ”

“Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly and continued, “How long will it take?” ”

“Li Shang said, “There are three episodes in total. One episode will last seven days.” ”

“When will it start?”Ye Zhuo continued to ask.

“Li Shang continued, “If you agree, you can join the group in a week.” ”

“Ye Zhuo nodded. “Alright, I’ll join.” ”

“Really?”Li Shang looked at ye Zhuo in disbelief.

“Have you brought the contract?”Ye Zao asked.

“Yes!”Li Shang quickly took out the contract.

Ye Zao took the contract and signed it cleanly.

Li Shang looked at the words on the contract and still felt a little confused.

Everything seemed to be going too smoothly.

...

On the other side.

At Tianhua Entertainment.

“Song Chenyu pushed open the door to his manager’s office. “Brother Chao, you were looking for me?” ”

“Chenyu is here.”Ma Chao immediately stood up from his office chair. “The filming of the second season of ‘country’is about to begin. The program team would like to invite you to be their resident guest.”

‘Brave Torrent’s country life’was a very popular summer variety show.

“The first season of filming in Meizhou last year had a viewership of over 2 billion when it first aired. It had made quite a few celebrities famous, and it had even made an old actress famous. ”

“As the most popular actress in Tianhua Entertainment, Song Chenyu naturally received the best resources. ”

“Therefore, after obtaining the spot, Ma Chao was the first to think of Song Chenyu. ”

“Although song Chenyu did not lack traffic now, with how popular country was now, it was not wrong to increase the exposure. ”

“Song Chenyu’s popularity was not low to begin with. If she performed well on country, she would definitely reach another peak. ”

“Hearing this, song Chenyu frowned slightly. “Brother Chao, you should know that I dislike reality shows the most.” ”

Every celebrity in the entertainment industry had their own persona.

The slightest carelessness in participating in a reality show would cause the persona to fall apart.

Song Chenyu only wanted to act well and did not want to participate in these messy variety shows.

“Ma Chao handed song Chenyu a document, “This is the guest list for ‘country’. In the second season, other than Wei Xingzhi, there are also Lu Qi and song Yiwan. Although Lu Qi and song Yiwan have only debuted recently, their traffic and popularity are very good!” ”

“After saying that, Ma Chao continued, “I think they even hired a streamer who is very popular on the Miao Yin platform recently. What’s his name...” ”

“Ma Chao Thought for a long time before his eyes finally lit up, “Sitara YC’s Ye! Yes, that’s her! Don’t look down on her just because she’s a live streamer. She has over 90 million fans on the platform and is about to break through 100 million! Chenyu, this opportunity is really rare. I hope you can consider it carefully!” ”

Sitara YC’s Ye?

A faint light flashed across song Chenyu’s originally calm eyes.

“If she remembered correctly, Ye Zao’s Streamer name on Miao Yin platform was ye of Sitara YC. ”

Could it really be ye Zao?

She did not expect ye Zao to participate in such a variety show.

Could it be that ye Zao wanted to debut as a star?

Debut?

Did Ye Zao really think that it was so easy to enter the entertainment industry?

With her around.

Ye Zao would not be able to successfully debut!

“Song Chenyu quickly flipped through a few pages of the name list. When she saw ye Zao’s name, she raised her eyebrows slightly. A bright light flashed in her eyes as she looked up at Ma Chao, she smiled and said, “Since brother Chao has already said so, then if I don’t go, wouldn’t I be letting down brother Chao’s good intentions?” ”

“Ma Chao looked up happily. “Chenyu, does that mean that you agree?” ”

“Yes.”Song Chenyu nodded.

“Ma Chao smiled and said, “Then I’ll make the arrangements for you. We’ll enter the set in a week.” ”

“”Alright.”Song Chenyu continued, “Then I’ll have to trouble you, Brother Chao.” ”

“It’s my pleasure.”

...

“A week later, the filming crew of ‘village’really started filming in a small mountain village in the East Continent. ”

“The small mountain village was surrounded by mountains on all sides and had a beautiful scenery. However, the location was a little remote. After getting off the plane, they had to take a three-hour car ride before they could reach their destination. ”

At this time.

Three people had already gathered in the small farm courtyard arranged by the program team.

They were the well-known actor Wei Xingzhi.

Wei Xingzhi was 49 years old this year. He had been there since the last episode of the program.

“He had become famous early, and everyone addressed him as teacher Wei. ”

The other two people were Lu Qi and song Yiwan.

The three of them were sitting in the courtyard and chatting.

“Dongzhou was a tropical region. It was summer all year round, and the hot sun was roasting the earth. Although the small courtyard was shaded by trees, the three of them were still extremely hot. ”

“Lu Qi went into the house and brought out three bottles of ice-cold cola. “Teacher Wei, Yi Wan, have some cola.” ”

“Thank you.”

“Thank you.”

The two of them thanked him.

Wei Xingzhi pulled open the tab and drank more than half of the cola.

Song Yi Wan only took a small sip symbolically.

Female celebrities were different from ordinary people. They were very strict with their figures.

Song Yi Wan was 1.68 meters tall and weighed only 90 kilograms. She usually ate rice according to the number of grains.

“Drinks Like Cola, which were high in sugar, were even more untouchable. ”

“Lu Qi continued, “I don’t know who will come next. Teacher Wei, Yiwan, have you seen the guest list?” ”

“Song Yiwan thought for a moment and then said, “There seems to be an internet celebrity.” ”

“”Internet Celebrity?”There were no cameras filming at the moment. Hearing this, Lu Qi said bluntly, “When did the threshold of ‘village’become so low? Even an internet celebrity can record a show with us?” ”

Celebrities relied on their acting skills and true abilities to earn a living.

What did an internet celebrity know?

Lu Qi did not have a good impression of an internet celebrity.

“In his opinion, an internet celebrity was the kind of person who wore revealing clothes and stood in front of the camera, showing off his coquettishness. “Thank you, Big Brother, for the sports car!” ”

“”Thank you, Big Brother, for your love!” ”

“”Love, Big Brother!” ”

“When he thought of the live broadcast of some female internet celebrities, Lu Qi could not help but shudder. ”

It was a little disgusting.

“Song Yiwan scratched her head. “I’m not too sure about the specifics, but that internet celebrity doesn’t seem to be simple.” ”

“A hint of mockery flashed across Lu Qi’s eyes. “If it was simple, would it be able to be on ‘country’?” ”

“Without even thinking, it was obvious that this internet celebrity had definitely entered through the back door. ”

Wei Xingzhi did not say anything and silently took a sip of his coke. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The entertainment industry was now under the control of the young people.

As for old people like them...

It was better to be careful with their words and actions so as not to attract trouble.

“After saying that, Lu Qi continued, “Who else will participate?” ”

Song Yiwan glanced at Lu Qi. “Didn’t you look at the program list?”

“I didn’t.”Lu Qi shook his head.

“Song yiwan continued, “Song Chenyu, Chang Yu, and Wang Xuancheng seem to be the guests invited by the program team. Oh right, Yin Wei, who acted in last year’s youth school drama, is also one of them.” ”

“Upon hearing song Chenyu’s name, Lu Qi was extremely excited and quickly asked, “Do you think song Chenyu will come to our program?” ”
