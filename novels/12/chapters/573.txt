Translator: 549690339

“After a long while, Lin Qingxuan finally reacted. She looked at doctor Zhou and asked, “Are you sure that the results are okay?” ”

“After her joy, Lin Qingxuan was a little worried. ”

What if it was a misdiagnosis?

Lin Qingxuan did not want to experience despair after experiencing hope.

“Doctor Zhou smiled and said, “Our Hospital uses the most advanced equipment. There’s absolutely no mistake! If you don’t believe me, Mr. Lin, you can go to another hospital for another check-up.” ”

Lin Qingxuan did not dare to believe this result. He dragged Lin Jincheng to another hospital for another check-up.

The results were the same.

Everything was normal.

There was nothing wrong with him.

“After running to five hospitals in a row, Lin Qingxuan finally believed that there was nothing wrong with him. ”

He did not expect that he had been living in a lie all these years.

“He trusted Zhao shinning so much, but Zhao shinning had lied to him. ”

“Jincheng!”

“For the first time in his life, Lin Qingxuan hugged Lin Jincheng and cried like a child. ”

Lin Jincheng did not know how to comfort him.

He could only Pat Lin Qingxuan on the back.

“After a long while, Lin Jincheng finally said, “Fourth brother, what do you plan to do next?” ”

Lin Qingxuan’s emotions gradually calmed down. “I plan to have a good talk with her.”

“Lin Jincheng nodded. “It’s good that you know what to do, fourth brother.” ”

On the other side.

The Lin family.

From 8 am to 1 pm in the afternoon.

There was no movement from the Li family home at all.

“This time, Old Madam Lin couldn’t sit still any longer. “Shu Ning, Qianhua has already gone back. Why isn’t Li Yibiao here yet? Does he not want to come?” ”

“Zhao Shu Ning was a little anxious. “Mom, I’ll make a call and ask around.” ” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Alright.”Old Madam Lin nodded.

Zhao Shu Ning called the Li family home.

“It was unknown what was said on the other end of the phone, but Zhao Shu Ning’s expression changed. ”

“After a long while, Zhao shuning finally reacted and turned around to walk into the house. ”

“”Shuning, what did the Li family say?” ”

“Zhao shuning looked at Old Lady Lin and said, “Something happened to the Li family. The Li Corporation was found to have evaded taxes. Because the amount involved was relatively large, Li Yibiao is now under the police’s control.” ”

“What?”Old Lady Lin frowned.

She had originally wanted to marry ye Zhuo to Li Yibiao so that she could show off to Ye Shu. How did something happen to Li Yibiao in the blink of an eye?

Zhao shuning also felt that this matter was a little strange.

The Li Corporation was not a small family.

How could something happen to them just like that overnight?

Could it be that someone was targeting the Li Family?

Who was this person?

Zhao shuning frowned.

Could it be that he was ye Zao?

But was ye Zao really that capable?

Or did Lin Jincheng already know about this?

“But according to Lin Jincheng’s power, it wouldn’t be easy to eliminate the Li family without anyone noticing. ”

Then what was going on?

Zhao shuning wasn’t concerned about Li Yibiao.

“What she was concerned about was, if something happened to Li Yibiao, who would marry ye Zao? ”

It wasn’t easy for her to think of a way to deal with ye Zao.

No!

She couldn’t let ye Zao escape just like that.

“Zhao shuning narrowed her eyes and continued, “Mom, although the Li family is gone, we still have other families. I believe that there will always be a suitable family for ye Zao.” ”

“”Then, which family do you think is suitable?”In a short while, Old Lady Lin really couldn’t think of any suitable family. ”

“Zhao shuning smiled and said, “Mom, what do you think of my cousin?” ”

Zhao shuning indeed had a cousin.

“His cousin was 35 years old this year. He had all kinds of food, drinks, prostitution, and gambling. He was married once, and his wife divorced him because she couldn’t stand domestic violence. ”

“From then on, he was still single. ”

“If ye Zhuo married such a person, wouldn’t he die? ”

“Old Lady Lin asked in confusion, “Who is your cousin?” ”

“”Zhao Zhuangzhi.”Zhao shinning continued, “His father’s name is Zhao Haobo.” ”

“With that said, Old Lady Lin had some impression of him. “Good, good, good! A Kiss and a Kiss! Then it’s decided! Shinning, take some time to go back to your mother’s house and tell them about this.” ”

“Old Lady Lin was a daughter of the Zhao family. When she heard that Ye Zhuo was going to marry into the Zhao family, she was naturally happy. ”

“”Mom, what are you guys talking about?”Lin Qingxuan suddenly walked in from outside the door. “What do you mean by Kiss and marriage?” ”

“Old Lady Lin didn’t say anything, but her gaze was a little evasive. ”

Zhao shuning looked at Lin Qingxuan. “We’re talking about introducing ye Zao to Zhuang Zhi.”

“What did you say?”Lin Qingxuan looked at Zhao shuning in disbelief.

Zhao shuning felt that there was something wrong with Lin Qingxuan today. “Are you deaf? I said I’m going to introduce Zhuang Zhi to ye Zao!”
