Smith stood up and turned to look at Chris. “Are you sure it’s L?”?

Chris nodded. “Every computer on the first floor shows an’L’!”

This was L’s usual method.

“After saying that, Chris continued, “Miss Ye broke through the firewall and restored the surveillance. I think that L is definitely coming for Miss Ye! After all, Miss Ye is the first opponent L has encountered in his career.” ”

“Hearing that, Smith frowned. ”

Came for ye Zao?

But didn’t Yadar say that the person who restored the surveillance was Boris?

“The deputy executive turned to look at ye Zao and continued, “Miss Ye, then please follow me down to take a look!” ”

“Ye Zao’s tone was shallow, like two birds with one stone, “Since Mr. Yadar has always thought that I’ve picked up Mr. Boris’s loopholes, then let Mr. Boris Go! I think, since Mr. Polly can restore the surveillance footage that L personally hacked,. Then it shouldn’t be a problem for him to counterattack and defeat L.” ”

“Polly was stunned for a moment, then he quickly reacted. ”

“Even if ye Zao didn’t say it, he would have stood up himself! ”

He was the one who restored the surveillance footage!

What was going on if ye Zao went down?

“Since he could restore the surveillance footage that L hacked, he could also defeat L! ”

“Once he defeated L, he would become famous. ”

“Thinking of this, Boris was extremely excited. ”

Chris was a little confused.

What was going on?

Did it mean that the person who restored the surveillance footage was actually Boris?

But he was standing right beside ye Zao at that time.

The person who restored the surveillance footage was clearly ye Zao.

When did it become Boris?

“”Do you even need to say that?”Adar stood in front of Boris and looked at Smith. He continued, “Miss Smith, don’t worry. Boris will definitely defeat L and maintain our Selead branch’s confidential system.” ”

“Smith nodded. “Mr. Adar, I believe in You!” ”

Adar looked at Polly. “Let’s Go!”

Polly followed Adar’s footsteps.

“When he passed by Ye Zao, Adar snorted coldly. ”

Ye Zao did not take him to heart. He raised his head and looked at Smith. “Miss Smith.”

“Go ahead.”

“Smith thought that ye Zao would explain to her about restoring the surveillance cameras. He did not expect that.., ye Zhuo said, “Leave the matter of finding Carl to me. Then, you can assign ten more people to me. I will definitely bring Carl back in one piece.” ”

“Ten people? Are you sure?”Smith asked.

“Ye Zhuo nodded. “Yes, I am sure.” ”

“Smith thought for a moment. “How about this, I will assign ten more people to you and add an elite team. You must bring Carl back.” ”

Smith more or less knew about ye Zhuo’s ability.

He was the youngest executive officer in ABA.

“If she didn’t have any ability, she wouldn’t have been sent by Bab to support them. ” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“No need.”There was no special expression on ye Zhuo’s face. “Ten people will do.”

“”That’s good.”Smith nodded. “If miss ye needs anything, remember to tell us at any time.” ”

“Okay.”

“”Also,”Smith hesitated for a moment before continuing, “Yadar has a weird temper. Regarding the restoration of the surveillance cameras, I hope that Miss Ye can give me some face and apologize to Yadar.” ”

Apologize?

“Ye Zhuo’s lips curled up slightly. “Don’t worry, Miss Smith. After Mr. Polly defeats L. , I will definitely apologize to Mr. Yadar personally.” ”

“At this moment, Smith suddenly could not understand ye Zao. ”

“If it was anyone else, they would probably be angry from embarrassment. However, she was still smiling and was not angry at all. ”

It gave people the illusion that the surveillance camera was ye Zao’s recovery.

“Thinking of this, Smith’s heart skipped a beat. ”

Could it be that the surveillance camera was really recovered by ye Zao?

Ten minutes.

“Ye Zao only used ten minutes to restore the surveillance. If that was really the case, how terrifying was her strength? ”

No.

It couldn’t be.

Smith still felt that it was a little impossible. Polly was the top computer expert in the headquarters!

She had studied computers for a whole twenty years.

How Old was ye Zao?

“Not to mention studying computers for twenty years, she was probably not even twenty years old yet. ”

“Therefore, Ye Zhuo must have picked something up. ”

In the cubicle on the first floor.

Everyone’s computers were in a state of Blackout. Everyone was in a mess.

Polly went to the main console.

The result was the same.

Even the computer was controlled by someone.

“Faced with such a situation, Polly had no idea where to start. ”

Calm down.

The current him had to calm down immediately.

“Adar asked, “How is it?” ”
