Translator: 549690339

Old Leaf Chen hoped that song Shiyu would have a conscience.

“Besides, Chen Siyao wasn’t bad, not to mention that she loved song Shiyu so much. ”

The two of them were simply a match made in heaven.

“Song Shiyu’s left hand rested on the chair. He tapped on the handle with his index finger and spoke faintly, “Ten years ago, Chen Youlong had an accident on the winding mountain highway. I was the one who pulled him back from death. “Eight years ago, the Chen Corporation was maliciously reported. For a time, the tree fell and the monkeys scattered. I was the one who pulled the Chen Corporation back on the right track. “Seven years ago... “. “...” ”

“Song Shiyu spoke one by one. The expression on old master Chen’s face was a little interesting. Suddenly, he raised his head to look at Song Shiyu. “Alright! You Don’t have to say anymore!” ”

“After he finished speaking, old master Chen continued, “What happened in the past is already in the past!” ”

“Besides, a drop of kindness should be repaid with a spring. Was it interesting that song Shiyu kept mentioning this? ”

“So you also know that what happened in the past is already in the past?”Song Shiyu turned to look at Old Master Chen.

“Old Master Chen continued, “If it weren’t for me in the past, you would have frozen to death long ago! Song Shiyu, you have no conscience!” ”

“Song Shiyu curled his lips slightly. His expression was unclear as he continued, “Are you telling a person who killed his father to have a conscience?” ”

Killing his father.

“Upon hearing this, Old Master Chen’s face instantly turned pale. ”

That’s right.

How could he have forgotten song Shiyu’s true nature.

Song Shiyu was a person who killed gods and gods when he encountered them. He was an existence who killed all who stood in his way. There was no good or evil in his eyes.

“”Butler song,”song Shiyu continued. ”

Butler song immediately walked forward. “I’m here.”

“Song Shiyu said, “Send the guest out.” ”

“At that moment, Old Master Chen felt as if song Shiyu had changed into a different person. ”

It was so unfamiliar.

Old Master Chen just looked at him and was momentarily speechless. He did not even have time to react.

Song Shiyu picked up a cigarette and was about to light it before putting it down again.

“In the year that he had tried to forget about her, he had started smoking again. But now, he suddenly did not want to smoke anymore. ”

“When doctor Liu walked him in, he happened to see this scene. A look of surprise flashed in his eyes. ”

It was really strange that boss song had put the cigarette back into the distance.

“”Boss song,”doctor Liu continued. ”

Song Shiyu looked up at Doctor Liu. “You’re here?”

“”Yes.”Doctor Liu said as he walked in, “I saw Old Master Chen at the door just now. He didn’t make things difficult for you, did he?” ”

“He knew the relationship between song Shiyu and Old Master Chen, ”

“it wasn’t that song Shiyu was afraid of Old Master Chen, but that song Shiyu respected old master Chen, so every time old master Chen stood up straight in front of Song Shiyu. ”

Who in Yun Jing dared to say that third master song wasn’t right?

But Old Master Chen dared!

Song Shiyu shook his head. “No.”

“”That’s good.”Doctor Liu continued, “Have you finished taking the painkillers from yesterday?” ”

“”Yes,”song Shiyu said. ”

“Hearing this, doctor Liu had an ‘I knew it’expression on his face, “Boss song, Don’t blame me for being naggy. Your body really can’t take it anymore! Love Yourself Well! If you don’t want to die young, then cooperate with my treatment!” ”

Meeting a patient like song Shiyu gave Doctor Liu a headache.

“Song Shiyu turned to look at Doctor Liu. “If I cooperate with you well, will I be able to recover?” ”

“”Of course!”Doctor Liu was a brilliant doctor, and he was very confident about this. ”

“”Then I’ll cooperate with you,”song Shiyu continued. ”

“Doctor Liu thought he was hearing things. “Boss song, what did you say?” ” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Cooperate with him?

It was simply unbelievable!

“”Yes.”Doctor Liu nodded. “You didn’t hear wrong. Doctor Liu, I’ll cooperate with you.” ”

Bai Jiayu was right. The most beautiful thing about love was to protect and wait.

“If he died, what would happen if someone bullied her in the future? ”

“Therefore, nothing could happen to him! ”

“Doctor Liu was a little agitated. “Boss song, Let’s start the treatment plan from today, shall we?” ”
