Translator: 549690339

She couldn’t even count the number of female companions in her old age.

“If she didn’t get along with Ye Zao, her side wouldn’t be as calm as it was now. ”

“Of course, if ye Zao wasn’t the Goddess Xian ‘er, she wouldn’t have said these words. ”

She wanted to remind ye Zao to be more careful.

“Ye Zao was so outstanding, there was no need to hang himself on the tree of Cen Shaoqing. ”

“If Cen Shaoqing had done something to let ye Zhuo down, Ye Zhuo should have dumped him immediately. ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled at Xian ‘er and continued, “Don’t worry, he won’t.” ”

“”Goddess, do you trust fifth master so much?”Xian ‘er looked at ye Zhuo in disbelief. ”

“If it were anyone else, they would have more or less learned to be more careful, but ye Zhuo trusted Cen Shaoqing so much. ”

“He’s worth it.”

“Although it was only three words, it stunned Xian ‘er. ”

It seemed that she had not seen such mutual trust and love for a long time.

It was inexplicably enviable.

Such love was too extravagant for Xian ‘er.

“She understood her situation very well. If she were to leave Yu Niannian in the future, she could only find an honest man to marry. ”

Love could only be thought about in the next life.

“For a person like Yu Mumu, he would never give up an entire garden for a woman. ” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Right now, they were just taking what they needed. ”

Yu Mumu also looked at ye Zao with a slightly stunned expression.

“His gaze was unclear, but he suddenly felt very envious of Cen Shaoqing. ”

“Why are both of you looking at me like that?”Ye Zao looked at the two of them and touched the corner of his lips. “Is there something dirty on my face?”

“”No, no.”Xian ‘er smiled and said, “I’m quite envious of you and fifth master. They trust each other and understand each other.” ”

Not everyone could have this kind of two-way love.

“Ye Zhuo turned to look at Xian ‘er and continued, “You can meet them too. However, if you want to get something in life, you have to lose something. You Can’t have it both ways. It depends on what you choose.” ”

“Hearing this, Xian ‘er was stunned. ”

Ye Zhuo must have already seen through the matter between her and Yu Xiannian.

“After saying this, ye Zhuo continued, “In fact, life is a process of constantly choosing and choosing. Following your heart is the most important thing.” ”

How could a child not be a fish know the joy of fish?

“Mm.”Xian ‘er nodded and lowered her head to eat a vegetable salad. The vegetable salad that was very delicious in the past always felt like something was missing today.

It was extremely bitter.

“After ye Zhuo finished the last two desserts, he said, “I’m done eating. You guys can help yourselves.” ”

“Okay.”Yu Xiannian nodded.

“After ye Zhuo left, only Xian ‘er and him were left at the dining table. ”

They were relatively speechless.

“The atmosphere seemed a little awkward. Xian ‘ER also stood up at this time. “Young Master Yu, I’m full too.” ”

“In fact, Xian ‘er had only eaten less than a third of the vegetable salad in front of her. ”

“After saying that, Xian er stood up and left. ”

“She did not return to her room immediately. Instead, she went to the zither room. ”

“Just as she walked to the side of the zither room, she heard the melodious sound of a zither. Although Xian er could not play music, her heart trembled when she heard it. ”

An outstanding person would always be so outstanding no matter what they did.

Ye Zhuo had a habit of touching a zither after dinner.

Xian er reached out and knocked on the door.

“The zither music did not stop. “Come in, the door isn’t locked.” ”

Xian ‘er pushed the door open and entered. “Goddess.”

Ye Zhuo looked back and his ten fingers stopped between the zither strings. “Xian ‘er.”

“”Goddess, do you have time to chat?”Xian ‘er asked. ”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Xian ‘er sat opposite ye Zhuo and continued, “Goddess, how long have you been learning the zither?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao Thought for a moment. “About two to three months.”

“Two to three months is that good?”Xian ‘er asked incredulously.

“Ye Zao smiled and explained, “I have learned the pipa. Most instruments are similar and the music theory is interlinked, so it is easier to learn than beginners.” ”

Xian ‘er nodded. “I see.”

“Then Xian ‘er continued, “Goddess, I want to ask you a question.” ”

“”Ask,”ye Zao said. ”

“Xian ‘er looked at ye Zao and said, “If you were me, what would you choose?” ”
