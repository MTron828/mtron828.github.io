Translator: 549690339

“As a daughter, Li Hang did not want to see his parents become like this. ”

“No matter how incompetent Li Da Long was, he was still his father. ”

“Li da long said, “Go in. Don’t worry. I Won’t argue with your mother. Dad knows what to do.” ”

“Okay.”Li hang turned around and returned to the house.

“After Li Hang returned to the house, Li da long raised his head to look at Zhou Cuihua whose eyes were already red and swollen. He then said, “What exactly do you want to do? Aren’t you satisfied with the life you have now?” ”

The life you have now?

Could it be that Li da long still felt that she was living a good life now?

“Zhou Cui Hua originally did not want to argue with Li da long, but when she heard these words, her anger was ignited in an instant. ”

“I haven’t wanted to live such a life for a long time!”

“Li Da long put down his chopsticks. “Then tell me, what do you want to Do?” ”

“Up until now, he still did not understand what Zhou Cui Hua was angry about? ”

“He did not eat, drink, go to prostitutes, gamble, or beat up his wife. ”

“When he was middle-aged, he did not have to worry about food and drink. His family’s conditions were decent. ”

“With such living conditions, how could Zhou Cui Hua not be satisfied? ”

How did she end up like this!

“Zhou Cui Hua did not know what she wanted to do either. As long as she thought about Xia Xiaoman’s current life, she would feel very uncomfortable. ”

This was what she dreamed about in her dreams at night.

She did not know anything else.

“However, she knew that other people’s lives could not be envied. They could only be exchanged with actual actions. ”

“If she wanted to exchange for such a life, the first thing she had to do was to get a divorce. ”

She was already at this age. She could not be delayed by Li da long any longer.

“If she were to delay any longer, she would not have any chance at all. ”

“Zhou Cui Hua raised her head to look at Li da long and said, “I want to divorce you.” ”

Yes.

She wanted a divorce.

She wanted to escape from a useless man like Li Da Long.

Divorce?

Li Da Long was stunned for a moment.

“He had spent most of his life with Zhou Cui Hua. Although he had had his ups and downs, he had never thought of divorcing her. ”

“But now, Zhou Cui Hua had actually taken the initiative to bring up this matter. ”

“What did you say?”Li Da Long thought that he had heard wrongly.

There was nothing going on between him and Zhou Cuihua. There was no reason for Zhou cuihua to bring up divorce.

“Therefore, it was definitely an illusion. ”

“Zhou cuihua looked at Li da long with a calm gaze and a calm tone. “I said, let’s get a divorce.” ”

This marriage had to be divorced immediately!

“”Why?”Li Da Long looked at Zhou Cuihua in disbelief. “Hang Hang is about to have a family, and you’re saying that you want a divorce now! What are you trying to do?” ”

Divorce at such an old age? Wasn’t this a joke?

“Li Da Long was a somewhat traditional man, and his views on marriage were also very traditional. ”

They would be a couple for the rest of their lives.

“Zhou cuihua continued, “Li da long, you’ve delayed me for so many years. I beg you to let go! I can give up everything, I just want to divorce you!” ”

Li Da Long didn’t have much wealth anyway.

“Li da long said, “Zhou Cui Hua, are you crazy?” ”

“”Yes, I’m Crazy!”Zhou Cui Hua looked at Li da long and continued, “If I wasn’t crazy, why would i choose to marry someone like you back then!” ”

Zhou Cui Hua’s tone was filled with disgust towards Li da long. It was as if she would vomit if she took another look at this man.

“In fact, this was how Zhou Cuihua felt right now. ”

She did not even want to look at Li Dalong anymore.

“”You have someone outside?”Li Dalong looked straight at Zhou cuihua, his eyes filled with anger. ”

“It must be because he had been on business trips all year round, so Zhou Cuihua could not stand the loneliness of having someone outside! ”

“If not, Zhou cuihua would definitely not have suddenly proposed a divorce! ” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“No.”Zhou cuihua directly denied it.

“Li dalong said, “If there’s no one, why do you want to divorce me so much?” ”

“”I just don’t want to continue living with you!”Zhou cuihua continued, “Li Dalong, I was blind in the past to fall for a person like you! I beg you to let me off!” ”

Li Dalong looked at Zhou cuihua. “Just admit it! Do you have someone outside!”

“”Yes, I am seeing someone else!”Zhou cuihua simply admitted to these groundless accusations so that Li Dalong wouldn’t pester her and refuse to let go. “So, Li Dalong, let’s get a divorce!” ”

Li Dalong’s face revealed such an expression.

No wonder.

No wonder he lost his temper the moment he returned.

“It turned out that it wasn’t menopause, but that there was a wild man outside. ”

It was too much!
