“Even at this stage, Zhou Zuolong was still thinking about his own face. ”

“Zhou zuolong continued, “I still have to make Zhou Xiang Kowtow to me and apologize on behalf of Zhou Jinbei! This video has to be recorded online as well.” ”

Zhou Xiang and Zhou Jinbei were biological siblings.

“As long as Zhou Xiang denied those things online and stood on the opposite side of Zhou Jinbei, Zhou Jinbei would not be able to continue this scene. ”

“”Alright, I got it.”Xie wanqiu nodded. ”

On the other side.

At the CEN residence.

Zhou Xiang was wearing exquisite makeup and a brown windbreaker to adjust the temperature as she walked out.

“Old Mrs. Cen said, “Xiang Xiang, it’s already dark. Where are you going?” ”

Zhou Xiang turned around. “I’m going to the hospital.”

Going to the hospital?

“What are you going to the hospital for? Are you going to see Zhou Zuolong?”Old Mrs. Cen asked.

“Zhou Xiang nodded. “No matter what, Zhou Zuolong is still my father. Although Xie Wanqiu has never given birth to me, she is still my stepmother. At a time like this, I have to go and see them.” ”

“Before Old Mrs. Cen could react, Zhou Xiang’s figure had already disappeared into the snowy night. ” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Old Mrs. Cen looked in the direction where Zhou Xiang had disappeared, her eyes filled with worry. ”

“This silly child wasn’t going to be silly again, right. ”

“”No, I have to follow her!”Old Mrs. Cen quickly went back to her room to change into a pair of shoes and called the driver. “Xiao Lan, go to the Second Hospital!” ”

“”Yes, Old Mrs. Cen.” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen got into the car. She thought for a moment and felt that something was wrong. “Xiao Lan, stop the car.” ”

“Okay.”Xiao Lan pulled over to the side of the car.

Old Mrs. Cen opened the door and got out of the car. She walked to the side of the road and picked up a brick and placed it in her handbag.

“If Zhou Xiang dared to be foolish again, she would use this brick to slap Zhou Xiang awake. ”

Even though she usually had a deep relationship with Zhou Xiang’s mother-in-law.

“But at times like this, she could not be soft-hearted. ”

She had already given Zhou Xiang so many chances.

“”When the time comes, I will first slap Zhou Xiang, then slap Zhou Zuolong, and then Xie wanqiu, that mistress, to avenge my in-law’s mother!”When old Mrs. Cen said these words again, she had already forgotten, she was already an old lady who was almost ninety years old. ”

“With the brick in her hand, old madam Cen felt much more at ease. She returned to the car again. “Xiao Lan, continue to set off.” ”

Xiao Lan started the engine.

On the other side.

Zhou Xiang had already arrived at the second hospital. She stood in front of Xie Wanqiu’s ward and extended her hand to knock on the door.

“Very soon, the door opened. ”

The person who opened the door was none other than Xie wanqiu.

“Xie wanqiu rebuked, “Xiangxiang, why did you come so late! Your father is already angry from waiting! And that child Jinbei, he’s too insensible. How can he twist the truth! Quickly come and comfort your father!” ”

“”I’m sorry, there was a bit of traffic on the road. Where’s My Father?”Zhou Xiang was still the same as before. Facing Xie Wanqiu’s rebuke, she did not even dare to say a word of protest. ”

Xie wanqiu snorted coldly in her heart.

A Fool is a fool!

“Xie wanqiu smiled and said, “Your dad is inside. Hurry up and come in.” ”

Zhou Xiang followed Xie Wanqiu’s footsteps.

Zhou Zuolong sat on the sofa. “He’s here.”

“”Dad,”Zhou Xiang called out. ”

“You two siblings are one after another. Do you still treat me as your father?”Zhou Zuolong picked up the cup on the table and slammed it onto the ground.

Bang!

The pieces scattered.

“Seeing Zhou Xiang lowering her head and not daring to say a word, Zhou Zuolong felt a little better, then he said, “Jinbei is your brother. As an elder sister, you did not teach your brother well. This is a big UNFILIAL Act! Now that Jinbei is not here, you can kowtow and admit your mistakes on behalf of Jinbei! Also, you will bring yinyin back tonight. Yinyin is a golden twig and jade leaf. We can’t let her suffer and stay in the hospital with us! But you have to remember, it wasn’t Yinyin who paid the Cen family. You begged yinyin to stay in the Cen Family!” ”

“Zhou Zuolong paused. “Yinyin is the pearl in my hand. As long as I hear that you let yinyin suffer a little, I won’t Let You Go!” ”

Hearing these words.

The corners of Zhou Xiang’s mouth were filled with a self-deprecating smile.

How could she have been so stupid in the past?

Old Mrs. Cen was right. Zhou Zuolong and Xie wanqiu were almost crawling on top of her head to take a shit.

But she was still enjoying it.

Stupid.

She was simply incomparably stupid!

There would never be someone as stupid as her in the world.

She had let down her mother.

“Seeing that Zhou Xiang did not speak for a long time, Zhou Zuolong said sternly, “I’m talking to you. Are You Deaf?” ”

“Are you done?”Zhou Xiang looked up at Zhou Zuolong.

“At this moment, Zhou Xiang seemed to have changed into a different person. ”
