Endorsement?

Ye Zhuo frowned slightly and replied: [ distribute it to other streamers. YC will not accept any advertisements for the time being. ]

Not accept any advertisements?

Li Shang was stunned.

Which streamer would not accept any advertisements after signing a contract with a company?

“One had to know that other than receiving rewards, most of the streamer’s income came from live broadcasts and advertisements.”

“Even if the streamer wasn’t willing to accept the advertisement, the company would still accept it for the streamer. After all, the company had a contract with the streamer, and the company had the right to help the streamer accept the advertisement.”

But this CEO ye actually rejected his proposal!

Could it be that YC and CEO ye were boyfriend and girlfriend?

“He felt bad that YC’s live broadcast was too tiring, so...”

“For a moment, Li Shang’s imagination ran wild.”

“After all, YC had publicly admitted that she had a boyfriend.”

“A moment later, Li Shang replied, “Okay, I got it.””

“Ye Zhuo looked at the time, “Is there anything else?””

“There’s one more thing. There’s an important contract here that needs your signature. May I know when you’re Free?”

“Ye Zhuo had not been staying at school recently. After thinking about it, he did not seem to have any classes tomorrow afternoon. “Then let’s do it at three in the afternoon tomorrow. I’ll see you at the cafe on the road next to Jing University.””

[ Okay. ]

“After replying to Shang Li, Ye Zao summed up the income from the live broadcast during this period of time.”

A total of three million.

He divided it into two anonymous donations.

“One was donated to the poor mountain area, and the other was donated to the Rescue Center for Stray Cats and dogs.”

“After donating the money, ye Zao thought of how long it had been since he had gone to the technology network, so he went to the technology network again.”

30 minutes.

He solved 15 missions.

“Niu Hulu, the father of two children: [ F * ck! F * ck! 15 missions in 30 minutes? Am I seeing things? Sure enough, your father will always be your father! ]”

“Niu Hulu, Lou Laobo: [ Our Father is back! I’m so happy! ]”

“Niu Hulu, Qiang Guoguo, and Yu Di: [ today is another day for father to conquer the science and Technology World. ]”

Niu Hulu Kaixin 1985: [ I’m really impressed by Daddy’s hand speed! ]

Niu Hulu Qingyao: [ who else has the live broadcast video of the last science and Technology Conference? I want to see what kind of Daddy Daddy Daddy is! ]

“Niu Hulu 123456789: [ that one seems to not allow video recording. I was lucky enough to watch the live broadcast. Daddy is really Super good-looking! You should know the song Chenyu of the entertainment industry, right? Our Daddy is a hundred times better looking than song Chenyu! ]”

“Because song Chenyu had the title of a beauty that only appeared once in a thousand years, using her as an analogy would give a better picture.”

Niu Hulu Qingyao: [ F * ck! Is It True? ]

Niu Hulu Qiangguo and Yu Di: [ I testify! It’s true! ]

Niu Hulu Lou Laobo: [ I second the motion! ]

Niu Hulu: [ I second the motion! ]

“Niu Hulu: Don’t Be a dog, okay? [ I second the motion! ]”

The forums were filled with comments.

“Ye Zao wanted to close his eyes and Nod after completing his last mission. At this moment, he received a message from Dr. Warne: [ Miss Ye. ]”

[ hello. ]

Dr. Warne: [ I will send a document for you to receive. ]

“Although ye Zao was just a little girl, Dr. Warne had always used respectful words in front of him.”

“This was a form of respect, but it was also a form of faith.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Currently, in the science and Technology World, Ye Zao was a faith!”

[ Okay. ] Ye Zao accepted the document sent by Dr. Warne and opened it.

“Ten minutes later, Dr. Warne sent another message, [ Miss Ye, what do you think about this? ]”

“Ye Zao replied, [ I would like to encourage more students to join the science and Technology World and understand the science and technology world. How about this, I will establish the YC science and Technology award in my name. ]”

“[ on behalf of everyone in the science and technology world, I would like to thank you. ]”

[ it’s no big deal. ]

Dr. Warne: [ then I will tell this news to all the universities in the country tomorrow! Let the students actively participate! ]

[ Okay. ]

Downstairs.

Lin Jincheng returned from the north campus.

“Ye Shu had just come out to get some fresh air. When she saw Lin Jincheng, she immediately went to greet him. “How is fourth brother doing?””

“”Pretty good,”Lin Jincheng replied.”

“Ye Shu continued, “Fourth brother is really going to divorce Zhao Shuning?””

“Yes.”Lin Jincheng nodded. “He’s already been chased out by Mom.”

“Thinking of Zhao shuning, who was still in the limelight yesterday, Ye Shu sighed in her heart.”

Who would have thought that Zhao shuning would do such a thing?

“Pushing the blame of infertility onto Lin Qingxuan, not only did it delay Lin Qingxuan’s life, it also delayed her own life.”

It was simply not worth it.

“Ye Shu said, “Actually, this is a relief for fourth brother and Zhao shuning.””
