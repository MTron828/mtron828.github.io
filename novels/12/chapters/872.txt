Translator: 549690339

“”Of course you can!”Liu Caiyi did not think that she would lose and continued, “However, if Miss ye loses, I hope that Miss Ye can take the initiative to admit that she plagiarized!””

“Sure.”

A look of success flashed across Liu Caiyi’s eyes.

Ye Zhuo was just waiting to make a fool of himself.

“She had thought that ye Zao would think of a way to reject her, but she did not expect that this idiot, Ye Zao, would actually agree.”

“After saying that, Liu Caiyi walked out from her seat and walked towards the backstage.”

Ye Zao’s expression did not change as he stood up slightly.

“Old Madam Cen tugged at ye Zao’s hand. “Ye, you can do it!”Although she was not worried that ye Zao would lose, she could not lose the sense of ritual that she should have.”

“Ye Zao smiled. “Don’t worry, I will.””

“On the stage, the second elder had already gotten someone to arrange the easel for the painting.”

“For the sake of fairness, the two easels and the painting tools were the same.”

“On the stage, Liu Caiyi looked at ye Zao. “Miss Ye, although these two easels are the same, the visitor is the guest. You can choose first.””

“Thank you.”Ye Zhuo glanced at Liu Caiyi and walked towards the easel on the left.

“Ye Zhuo came to the easel. He was not in a hurry to put down his brush. Instead, he raised his hand to grind it.”

Haste makes waste.

“Drawing and writing required inspiration. It required painstaking work to have a soul, giving people a visual impact.”

Liu Caiyi came to the easel on the left and started to write.

It was better to strike first.

Painting was no exception.

“Liu Caiyi had studied Chinese painting for many years, and she knew Chinese painting very well. Moreover, the theme was decided by her.”

Landscape Garden.

“Recently, Liu Caiyi had been studying this theme, and she had visited many exhibitions about landscape garden.”

“Therefore, when the topic was set, she had a perfect landscape garden in her heart.”

“If ye Zhuo really knew how to draw, he wouldn’t have asked her to set the question.”

This meant that.

Ye Zhuo didn’t know how to draw at all.

“Because she already had the most perfect answer in her heart, Liu Caiyi’s strokes were exceptionally smooth, causing people to be amazed.”

Everyone at the table looked at the stage with rapt attention.

“President Liu is so amazing!”

“”As expected of the president. Although this painting is only halfway done, it has already let people see the Soul!””

“This is the first time I’ve seen president Liu Draw on the spot!”

“It’s so beautiful.”

“Seeing that Liu Caiyi was already halfway done, Ye Zhuo didn’t even move his brush.”

Discussions broke out among the seated people.

“What’s going on?”

“”I guess she doesn’t know how to draw! After all, she’s a plagiarist!””

“Oh my God! This is too embarrassing!”

“It’s indeed embarrassing. Even I feel embarrassed for her.”

“At this moment, Ye Zhuo picked up a brush, dipped it in ink, and started sketching. She was very fast, so fast that people could only see her afterimages.”

However.

“She was very fast, but people could not understand what she was drawing.”

There were no rules at all.

“Compared to the word ‘drawing’,.”

Or ‘doodling’would be more appropriate.

“”Oh my God, what is she doing?””

“I can’t understand it either? Is she drawing talismans?”

“”If I were her, I would just find a hole and crawl into it.””

Elder Qi looked at ye Zao and frowned slightly.

Could it be... that he had really misjudged someone?

Ye Zao did not know how to draw at all?

Elder Qi’s frown deepened.

“Listening to the discussions of the crowd, the corners of Liu Caiyi’s lips curled up.”

This was only the beginning.

“In a while, she would make ye Zao even more embarrassed!”

She would use her strength to prove to ye Zao what a true talented woman was!

Ye Zao.

She was just a clown.

“Ye Zao’s eyes and brows were still the same. Under the crowd’s discussion, his expression was indifferent as he changed a brush and began to color and shape it.”

It was like a magic trick.

“The originally messy painting became lively under ye Zao’s hands, as if it was suddenly given life.”

The discussion stopped abruptly at this moment.

“The air was terrifyingly quiet, as if someone had suddenly pressed the pause button.”

The second elder rubbed his eyes in disbelief.

“If he had not seen it with his own eyes, he might not believe that this was true.”

He also did not believe that a young lady who looked like she was only 18 or 19 years old could paint Chinese traditional arts so well.

Yet.

All of this happened in real life.

“Everyone at the banquet was stunned. “My God, this painting is too good!””

“It’s Amazing!”

“Ahhh! I’m about to Cry!”

“Hearing the discussions of the people at the banquet, the corners of Liu Caiyi’s mouth curled up slightly.” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Presumably everyone was shocked by her bar.
