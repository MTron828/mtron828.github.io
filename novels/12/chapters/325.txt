“”Zao Zao, what is This?” ”

Ye Zao sat on the sofa and played with his phone. “It seems to be a trophy.”

“Trophy?”Ye Sen quickly walked over and picked up the trophy. “Did those two people just send this?”

“Ye Zao nodded. “Uncle, did you run into them?” ”

“Ye Sen looked at the trophy. There was a line of words carved on the trophy. “The medical world directly awards trophies! Miracle Doctor Ye Zao...”saying this.., ye Sen finally realized what was going on. “F * ck! My niece, don’t tell me that the first person to cure cancer is you, Miracle Doctor Ye? !” ”

“It’s me.”Ye Zao was still calm.

Ye Sen was really surprised!

He did not expect that the person who had been on the international trending list for more than half a month and had become a god in one battle was actually his niece!

“Eldest niece! You’re really amazing!”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “That’s a must. Why Don’t you take a look at who my uncle is!” ”

“Ye Sen was coaxed into laughing out loud. He hugged the trophy and said, “Do you think this is pure gold?” ”

Ye Zhuo shook his head slightly. “I’m not too sure either.”

“”Let me have a bite.”Just as he said that, he leaned on the trophy and took a bite. “D * MN! There are teeth marks! It’s actually gold! This medical world is really generous!” ”

This trophy weighed at least ten kilograms.

“According to the current gold price, a trophy was worth about two million! ”

“However, no matter how poor the trophy was, it could not be pawned. Ye Sen continued, “By the way, other than the trophy, are there any other rewards?” ”

“Ye Zao said, “There should be a check in that envelope.” ”

Ye Sen immediately put down the trophy and picked up the envelope.

“After opening the envelope, there was indeed a check inside. The amount of the check was filled with a string of Arabic numbers. ”

“”A total of 50 million!”Ye Sen turned to look at Ye Zao. “Zao Zao, you’re a Little Rich Lady Now!” ”

“Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly, and there was a hint of laziness in his clear voice. “I was a little rich lady to begin with.” ”

“Ye Sen smiled and said, “That’s true!” ”

Ye Zao’s net worth had long passed the 12th digit.

It was just that ye Zao kept a low profile and wasn’t willing to show off.

...

On the other side.

Mu Yourong brought the proposal to ZY technology company.

Zhao Yang personally received her.

“”Miss Mu, I’ve seen your proposal, but I still have to discuss it with our CEO Ye.”Mu Yourong’s proposal was bold and innovative enough, and it was very in line with their business philosophy! ”

“However, they still had to wait for Ye Zhuo to see it before they could decide whether or not they wanted to cooperate with the MU family. ”

“After all, this was a major event. They could not casually cooperate with each other. ”

“Mu Yourong drank a mouthful of coffee and tucked her hair behind her ear. “CEO Zhao, I want to see your CEO Ye. I’ll tell him the details of the proposal!” ”

“Zhao Yang said apologetically, “I’m sorry, Miss Mu. Our CEO ye is not convenient to receive guests. If you have any needs, just tell me directly. I’ll help you pass on the message.” ”

“”I’m not a guest. I’m here to deliver money to your President Ye.”Mu yourong continued, “President Zhao, you’re a person of true ability. You’ve already seen my proposal. I believe that you should be very clear in your heart what kind of benefits this proposal will bring to your company, right? “Don’t lose a partner just because of a small matter!” ”

The last sentence carried a hint of threat.

“Mu Yourong was determined to win this matter. Zhao Yang, who was not afraid at all, directly refused. ”

“In the end, Zhao Yang was only a professional CEO. He also worked for others. He simply could not bear such a risk. ”

Zhao Yang had seen the plan.

It was done very well!

“If the negotiations fell apart because of a small matter, the consequences were indeed not something he could bear. ”

“After deliberating for a while, Zhao Yang continued, “Miss Mu, I still need to consult our director ye on this matter. How about this, you go back first. If our director ye agrees to meet you, I will inform you again. Is that okay with you?” ”

“”Yes.”Mu Yourong nodded. “However, there are some things that I have to say first. I will only wait for you for one night.” ”

“Alright.”

Mu Yourong turned to look at her assistant beside her. “Let’s go.”

The assistant hurriedly followed Mu Yourong’s footsteps.

“After Mu Yourong left, Zhao Yang hurriedly contacted ye Zhuo. ”

“Ye Zhuo had always been particularly attentive to the matters of the company. When she heard that a miss mu wanted to meet her with an excellent proposal, she immediately agreed. “Let’s set the time at 10:30 Tomorrow Morning.” ”

“”Okay.”Zhao Yang nodded. After hanging up the call with Ye Zao, he hurriedly went to contact mu yourong. ”

“On the other end of the phone, Mu Yourong’s face was filled with a determined smile. ”

This result was within her expectations.

“Right now, she just needed to properly do her hair and do a facial treatment. Tomorrow, she would be in the best state of mind to meet the mysterious and unpredictable ZY behind-the-scenes CEO Ye. ”

“Soon, the next day arrived. ”

“Mu Yourong, who was wearing exquisite makeup and a smart suit, came to ZY group as a businesswoman. ”

The front desk respectfully received Mu Yourong and brought her to the conference room.

“When they passed by the program department’s Cubicle, Mu Yourong suddenly saw a familiar figure. ”

That Was?

Ye Zhuo?

What was Ye Zhuo doing here?

Could it be that he was here to bring goods for a live broadcast?

She did not expect that such a high-level company like ZY would actually hire such a LOW-level streamer like ye Zao!

It was really disgusting to death!

“Mu Yourong narrowed her eyes, her eyes filled with disgust. It was fine if ye Zao did not meet her today. ”

Since he had met her.

Then did ye Zao Want to live-stream ZY again?

In your dreams!

“Even if song Shiyu did not make a move now, she would still borrow ZY’s behind-the-scenes director Ye’s hands to make ye Zao’s reputation in the live broadcast world fall apart. ” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“In the end, Ye Zao was just a small live streamer. ”

Once ZY made his move.

She still had a chance to turn things around?

“Very quickly, Mu Yourong was brought to the meeting room. ”

“In the meeting room, Zhao Yang was already waiting inside. “Miss Mu, this way please! Our Director Ye is currently in the program department due to some small matters. Please wait a moment.” ”
