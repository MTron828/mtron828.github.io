“Xiao Lin Zhi nodded as if he understood something. “Then, does the baby have to call everyone in the house who calls me brother and sister uncle and aunt?” ”

“”Yes, our Ah Zhi is really smart.”Ye Zhuo patted Xiao Lin Zhi’s head. ”

Xiao Lin Zhi tilted his head and looked at Ye Zhuo. “Sister is also very smart. She’s much smarter than Mommy. I don’t even understand what mommy is saying!”

“Xia Xiaoman walked over and poked Xiao Lin Zhi’s head with her finger. “You Little Brat, why are you still looking down on Your Mom?” ”

“”Mom, I’m sorry,”Xiao Lin Zhi continued, “But you’re really stupid. Haven’t you always taught me to be honest? I Can’t speak against my conscience, right?” ”

Ye Zhuo chuckled.

The others beside him also laughed out loud.

“Xia Xiaoman was a little speechless as she said, “When this child grows up, he’ll definitely be like his father. He’ll be a straight man made of Steel!” ”

“Lin Qingxuan was innocently caught in the crossfire. She looked at Lin Jincheng beside her and asked, “What’s a straight man made of Steel?” ”

Lin Jincheng rubbed his head. “I don’t know either.”

“Lin Zhi continued, “Then what’s my little nephew’s name?” ”

“Lin Xi.”Bai Jingshu smiled. “But you can also call him by his nickname.”

“What’s his nickname?”Xiao Linzhi asked.

“”Iron pillar,”Bai Jingshu answered. ”

Xia Xiaoman smiled. “Why did you give your child such a nickname?”

Iron pillar didn’t sound very smart.

“Bai Jingshu said, “Ah Ze gave it to him.” ”

“”Eleventh sister-in-law, is the baby’s name Iron Pillar?”Xiao Linzhi asked. ”

“Yes.”Bai Jingshu nodded.

“”Oh my god, that name Sounds So Nice!”Xiao Linzhi’s eyes lit up. He immediately hugged Xia Xiaoman. “Mommy, Mommy, give me a nice nickname too!” ” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Xia Xiaoman said, “Isn’t your name Ah Zhi Pretty Nice?” ”

“But I want a nickname too!”

“Xia Xiaoman didn’t know how to choose a nickname all of a sudden. She had no choice but to perfunctorily say, “Okay, okay, okay. Then Mommy will go home and think of a nickname for you.” ”

“”Mommy, you’re doing this again.”. “When we get home, you’ll definitely forget about this. Besides, I’m a child. Children don’t have good memories!”! “You’re bullying a child!”Xiao Lin Zhi continued, “Mommy, give me a nickname now!” ”

“Xia Xiaoman was about to say something when Xiao Lin Zhi seemed to suddenly remember something and continued, “Ah! I know! My nickname will be iron egg! This name is so nice!” ”

“What did you say?”Xia Xiaoman was dumbfounded.

“I want to be called Iron Egg!”Xiao Lin Zhi said.

“Upon hearing this name, Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “This child is quite smart. He even knows how to give himself a nickname.” ”

Ye Shu also smiled. “How did he come up with it?”

“No.”Xia Xiaoman objected.

“Why?”Xiao Lin Zhi asked.

“Xia Xiaoman continued, “Because this name doesn’t sound good.” ”

“Xiao Lin Zhi was very speechless, “Why doesn’t it sound good? Even a baby can be called iron pillar. Why Can’t I be called Iron Egg? I think iron egg sounds pretty good! and isn’t brother-in-law’s nickname also called Dog Egg? I Don’t care! I’m going to be called Iron Egg Anyway!” ”

“How is Iron Egg Nice to listen to!”

“I’m Iron Egg! Lin Iron Egg!”Xiao Lin Zhi retorted.

“No!”

“Dad!”Xiao Lin Zhi immediately looked at Lin Qingxuan.

“Lin qingxuan smiled and said, “Xiao Man, why are you fighting with the child? It’s just a nickname, our big name has been decided! Besides, I also think it sounds pretty good to be called Iron Egg! Just listen to the Child!” ”

“Xia Xiaoman was very helpless and could only nod in agreement. “Okay, okay, okay! Iron Egg it is! From today onwards, you are Lin Iron Egg!” ”

“Xiao Lin Zhidu cheered happily and raised his hands. “Yay, yay, yay! Oh, yay! Long live mommy and Long live daddy!” ”

Xia Xiaoman shook her head helplessly.

“An Lizi was also a little speechless. She looked at Xiao Lin Zhidu and said, “You will definitely regret it in the future.” ”

“Kobayashi looked at an Lizi. “Sister, you’re jealous of me.” ”

“Why would I be jealous of You?”An Lizi asked.

“Kobayashi continued, “You’re jealous that I have a nickname.” ”

An Lizi:”...”

“Kobayashi looked at everyone, he continued, “Grandma Cen, Aunt Xiang, little uncle, little aunt, eleventh brother, and eleventh sister-in-law, as well as Sister Jiao, Brother Cen, and my biological sister. From now on, I’ll Be Lin Tiedan. Remember to call me by my nickname!” ”

“After he finished speaking, he even bowed to everyone in a dignified manner. ”

Everyone was amused by Xiao Lin and burst into laughter.

A child was a child.

“After staying in the hospital until the afternoon, Ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing were ready to return. ”
