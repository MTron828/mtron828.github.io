Zhao Xueyin nodded. “I know.”

“Father Zhao lit a cigarette. “Take what I said to heart. Alright, it’s getting late. You should go upstairs and rest first.” ”

“Then I’ll go first.”Zhao Xueyin tucked the hair on her forehead behind her ears. “You should rest early too.”

On the other side.

Si lui drove the car slowly on the busy road.

“At this moment, his phone suddenly rang. ”

“Si lui picked up the phone and answered, “Hello.” ”

“Eldest young master.”A respectful voice came from the other end of the phone.

“”Speak.”Si lui put out the cigarette in the ashtray impatiently, his eyes filled with annoyance. ”

“The other side continued, “Young Master, today is LABA Festival. The old master has been waiting for you at home for a long time...” ”

“Waiting for me?”Si Lui’s lips curled into a mocking expression. “Isn’t he already in love with Jin Rujiu?”

“”Young master, there is no overnight feud between father and son. Why are you doing this?”At the end of his sentence, the man sighed deeply. ”

“Si Lui’s expression didn’t change much. “Uncle Fu, is there anything else? If there’s nothing else, I’ll hang up first.” ”

“”Don’t hang up, don’t Hang Up!”Uncle Fu hurriedly said, “Young master, don’t Hang Up First!” ”

“Is there anything else?”Si lui asked.

“Uncle Fu didn’t speak immediately. After a while, he said, “Young master, master has asked someone to investigate. Miss Zhao of the Shunxi Financial Group doesn’t have you in her heart! The person she wants to marry is the fifth master of the HK Financial Group. You Won’t be able to wait for the result. Come back! The old master is still waiting for you to take the lead. The Jin family needs you, and the financial group needs you even more!” ”

“You sent people to investigate her?”The lawyer’s voice instantly turned cold.

Zhao Xueyin was the lawyer’s bottom line.

He wouldn’t allow anyone to hurt Zhao Xueyin!

“Uncle Fu quickly explained, “Young master, don’t misunderstand. Master only sent someone to secretly visit her. He didn’t do anything to Miss Zhao!” ”

“Uncle Fu paused, then, he said, “There are plenty of fish in the sea! Why Do you love a single flower! There are many people in this world who are more outstanding than Miss Zhao. Since Miss Zhao doesn’t like you, it’s a waste of time for you to stay in the Shunxi Financial Group. It’s better for you to come back earlier... ... .. ”

Si lui tried his best to control the anger in his heart. “I know better than you what kind of person Xueyin is and who she has in her heart!”

Saying that Zhao Xueyin wanted to marry master five of HK?

It was impossible! RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“He and Zhao Xueyin had been together for so many years, and no one knew Zhao Xueyin better than him. Zhao Xueyin had never been a vain person. ”

There was also Zhao Zhenfei.

“He was not related to Zhao Zhenfei by blood, but Zhao Zhenfei treated him better than his biological father! ”

He saw all of this.

“”Eldest young master,”uncle Fu’s voice was a little weak, “This is the result of Master’s personal investigation. He is your biological father, and he will not harm you. Please believe him just this once...” ”

“Enough! Don’t say anymore!”Si Lui’s voice was close to an angry roar.

Uncle Fu on the other end of the phone immediately shut up.

“Si lui continued, “Uncle Fu, please tell the old man that I won’t believe a single word he says now! It’s even more impossible for him to sow discord in front of me! Didn’t he not want me to be with Zhao Xueyin? Then I must be with Zhao Xueyin! Not only do I want to be with Zhao Xueyin, I also want to become the son-in-law of the Zhao family!” ”

“After saying this, Si Lu hung up the phone. ”

“After hanging up, Si Lu opened the car window and took a deep breath. He tried his best to calm himself down. Zhao Xueyin had told him to drive properly. ”

He could not let his emotions affect his decision.

...

On the other end of the phone.

Uncle Fu looked at Old Master Jin who was standing at the side. He did not know how to speak. “Old...”

“Old Master Jin raised his hand and said calmly, “I heard everything.” ”

He wasn’t deaf. He heard everything that was said on the other end of the phone.

“Uncle fu comforted him, “Old Master, don’t worry too much. Maybe the eldest young master was just angry for a moment. He can’t really go to the Zhao family to become a son-in-law!” ”

Son-in-law!

It was impossible.

“Now, only the lawyer was left in the Jin family. Even if the lawyer wanted to go, Old Master Jin had a hundred ways to stop him. ”

Old Master Jin seemed to read Uncle Fu’s mind. “Do you think I have a way to stop him?”

Uncle Fu nodded.

“Old Master Jin laughed, “If he is determined to become a son-in-law, I really have no way! If I had a way, I wouldn’t be so passive like now!” ”
