Translator: 549690339

Xie Wanqiu’s speech was beautiful to the extreme.

“When people heard it, they felt that Cen Shaoqing had taken advantage of her. ”

It was Cen Shaoqing’s fortune to be able to marry such a good wife like Zheng Wanyin.

“Zhou Zuolong was very touched when he heard it. Things had become like this, but Xie Wanqiu’s thoughts were all about Zhou Xiang and Cen Shaoqing. ”

She even wanted to marry Zheng Wanyin to Cen Shaoqing.

Where in the world could she find such a good stepmother?

Let alone a stepmother!

Even her biological mother could not be like Xie wanqiu.

“”WANQIU, thank you. Thank you for being so considerate.”Zhou Zuolong’s eyes were red. “Mu Yang is thousands of miles away from the capital. I, I, I’m afraid that yinyin will be wronged if she marries here.” ”

“Xie wanqiu said that she couldn’t bear to part with Zheng Wanyin, but Zhou Zuolong said that he couldn’t bear to part with her, but he really couldn’t bear to part with her. ”

How Old was Zheng Wanyin when she first came to the Zhou Family?

She was like a kitten! VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“She was such a young child, and she asked her sister-in-law to take care of her. Xie Wanqiu was also worried. It was Zhou Zuolong who stayed by the bed every night and watched over Zheng Wanyin as he fed her milk. Little by little, he fed Zheng Wanyin until she was so big. ”

“Zhou Zuolong had never treated his children so well, but he had poured his heart and blood into Zheng Wanyin. ”

He had originally wanted Zheng Wanyin to look for a bride at home.

But Xie Wanqiu wanted her to marry into the capital.

“Hearing this, Xie wanqiu sighed, “How could I bear to marry Yinyin so far away? But if I don’t marry yinyin over, what can I do? I Can’t just watch ye Zhuo marry Shaoqing, right? “Xiangxiang’s biological mother passed away early. Although I’m her stepmother, I’ve long treated Xiangxiang as my own biological daughter! “I really can’t bear to see Xiangxiang being deceived by that little girl, Ye Zhuo, and Xiangxiang’s mother-in-law. When people get old, they become muddle-headed and mistake their fish eyes for pearls! “I’m really heartbroken!” ”

“As she said the last sentence, Xie wanqiu squeezed out two drops of crocodile tears. ”

Zhou Zuolong was also feeling extremely uncomfortable.

“Xie wanqiu continued, “Fortunately, Shaoqing that child’s character is not bad. I can rest assured that I’ll leave yinyin to him. So, old man, listen to me for once. Otherwise, even if I close my eyes, I won’t be at ease.” ”

“Zhou Zuolong took a deep breath and nodded. “Alright, I Promise You.” ”

“”Old Man, thank you.”Xie wanqiu was overjoyed. ”

“”Silly old woman, why are you being so polite with me?”Zhou Zuolong wiped the tears from Xie Wanqiu’s face. ”

“Xie wanqiu continued, “Although you agreed, Xiangxiang...” ”

“Seeing Xie wanqiu like this, Zhou zuolong said angrily, “What’s wrong with her? I’m her grandfather’s matchmaker for my grandson. Do I need her consent?” ”

“Xie wanqiu said calmly, “Although that’s what you said, Xiangxiang is Shaoqing’s mother after all. No matter what, we still have to get Xiangxiang’s consent for this matter. Old Man, listen to me. When you go to talk about this matter with Xiangxiang, you must not be angry with her. A peaceful family is always a happy thing. If things get out of hand, that’s not good!” ”

Zhou Zuolong nodded. “I know.”

“Zheng Wanyin said at the right time, “Grandpa and Grandma, I really don’t want to marry cousin. You guys should stop fooling around!” ”

Xie wanqiu rolled her eyes at Zheng Wanyin. “There’s no place for you to talk here.”

“Zhou Zuolong looked at Zheng Wanyin with a smile. “Yinyin, your grandma is doing this for your own good.” ”

“Zheng Wanyin sighed. “Even if I’m willing, cousin might not be willing. Grandpa, Let’s bring Grandma back with us! Let’s live our own lives in Muyang. Don’t get involved in these troublesome matters.” ”

Cen Shaoqing was unwilling?

Why was Cen Shaoqing unwilling?

“In Zhou Zuolong’s eyes, Zheng Wanyin was simply the most outstanding girl in the world. Cen Shaoqing had no reason to be unwilling. ”

“If she was unwilling, it should be Zheng Wanyin who was unwilling! ”

“Zhou zuolong said, “Don’t worry. With me stepping out, he won’t be unwilling.” ”

“Zheng Wanyin wanted to say something else, but Xie wanqiu continued, “Yinyin, I’m a little hungry. Go and buy me some food.” ”

“Okay.”Zheng Wanyin nodded and got up to buy some food.

“Looking at Zheng Wanyin’s back, Xie wanqiu continued, “Old Man, these days, I keep dreaming about yinyin’s mother. Tell me, am I going to leave soon too?” ”

“Hearing that, Zhou zuolong immediately said, “What nonsense are you talking about! It Won’t happen! You Won’t leave! You’re just angered by that evil woman.” ”
