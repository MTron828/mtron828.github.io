“If there’s one more person, it’s one more person! ”

“”Okay.”Yu Zifei bent down. “Sorry to trouble you, team leader Cen Jiang.” ”

Cen Jiang walked inside.

“When he arrived, Ye Zhuo’s welding work had already been completed. “Miss Ye.” ”

“What’s Wrong?”Ye Zhuo looked back slightly.

“Cen Jiang continued, “Old Nie’s disciple, Yu Zifei, wants to join our research team.” ”

Ye Zhuo took off his goggles. “Bring me to take a look.”

“Come with me.”

Ye Zhuo followed Cen Jiang’s footsteps and the two of them arrived outside the construction warehouse.

“Miss Ye!”Yu Zifei saw ye Zhuo and came up to him excitedly.

“Cen Jiang hurriedly introduced, “Miss Ye, this is old Nie’s disciple, Yu Zifei.” ”

Ye Zhuo looked at Yu Zifei. “Hello.”

“Yu Zifei said, “Miss Ye, I’m Yu Zifei, a metaphor. You Can Call Me Little Yu. I want to join your research group.” ”

“”The reason.”Ye Zao’s words were concise, and his eyes were cold. ”

“In terms of age, Yu Zifei was more than ten years older than ye Zao, but standing in front of ye Zao, Yu Zifei was extremely nervous, “Miss Ye, I’ve had an aerospace dream since I was young. I hope that one day I can board an aircraft carrier that I personally created and travel the universe! I believe that you will definitely lead us all to create an aircraft carrier that will amaze the world!” ”

“Speaking up to this point, Yu Zifei paused before continuing, “Even if I fail, it doesn’t matter! At least I’ve strived for my dream and worked hard!” ”

He was already in his thirties.

“Although he had joined the Cen family base, he had been a dispensable existence in the base for so many years. ”

He wanted to use this opportunity to fight for himself!

“Once he succeeded, he would be famous throughout the world! ”

“If he didn’t succeed, he could just start all over again! ”

“Have you thought it through?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly.

“Yu Zifei nodded. “Yes, Miss Ye, don’t worry. I definitely won’t quit at the last minute like my master did!” ”

“Are you sure?”Ye Zhuo asked again.

“Yu Zifei’s gaze was firm as he nodded. “Yes and definitely! Miss Ye, no matter how many times you ask, I will always give the same answer!” ”

“Ye Zhuo turned to look at Cen Jiang. “Cen Jiang, take Little Yu to arrange some work.” ”

Cen Jiang was stunned. Did Ye Zhuo agree to this?

Yu Zifei was also a little surprised.

“He had thought that ye Zhuo would make things difficult for him because he was old nie’s disciple, but now it seemed like he was being petty. ”

Ye Zhuo was not the kind of person to be calculative.

Cen Jiang nodded. “Alright.”Then he looked at Yu Zifei. “Follow me over here.”

“Yu Zifei followed Cen Jiang’s footsteps and turned to look at Ye Zhuo. “Miss Ye, thank you!” ”

“Work hard.”Ye Zhuo’s tone was clear and shallow.

“Yu Zifei hurriedly nodded. “Miss Ye, I Will!”He would definitely work hard and not let ye Zhuo down! ”

“After Yu Zifei left, Cen Hu came to Ye Zao’s side. “Miss Ye.” ”

“What’s Wrong?”Ye Zao looked back slightly. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Cen Hu continued, “The press conference is going to be held tomorrow! Do you think we should postpone the press conference for a few days?” ”

“”There’s no need.”Ye Zao’s tone was indifferent, but his voice was firm. ”

“Cen Hu frowned. “But now that more than half of the researchers have left, how are we going to explain to everyone at the press conference tomorrow?” ”

“The aircraft carrier project had just started, and half of the researchers had already disappeared. ”

“At the press conference, it would more or less look bad. ”

“”There’s no need to explain.”Ye Zhuo’s tone was a little flat, “Our ultimate goal is to create an aircraft carrier. The process is not important, but the results are! “Even if those who have a different heart don’t leave today, they will still be cleaned up in the future! “From another perspective, this might not be a bad thing for us!” ”

“Cen Hu nodded. “Alright, I’ll inform them. The press conference tomorrow will be held as usual.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

Ye Zhuo stayed at the base until midnight.

“When he got home, he took a rose bath before lying on the sofa and playing with his phone. ”

“Suddenly, Ye Zhuo saw a Weibo post. ”

It was about the aircraft carrier project.

“The blogger gave a long speech. First, he gave examples of the distance between the eight planets and earth. Then, he gave examples of the difficulties of building aircraft carriers. ”

“Finally, he summarized a sentence. ”

“China’s scientific research, success or failure, YC! ”

“Thus, the word YC successfully made the blogger become a trending topic. ”

“With a slight frown, ye Zhuo clicked forward to the post with the caption: [ I’m really sorry, I only have success in my dictionary, not failure. ] ”
