Translator: 549690339

“Xia Xiaoman nodded. Not far away, Cen Shaoqing was playing happily with the little guy. She smiled and said, “Shaoqing really likes children.” ”

“Regarding this point, ye Zhuo also felt that it was a little strange. He had never seen Cen Shaoqing like children so much. Faced with the Cen family’s few older sisters and children, Cen Shaoqing also had a serious look on his face. Yet, when faced with these five little guys.., cen Shaoqing seemed to have changed. ”

“Yang Wenyin raised her head and looked at Xia Xiaoman. “Xiaoman, what’s your due date?” ”

“”Three days,”Xia Xiaoman said. ”

“”That’s soon!”Yang Wenyin turned back to look at Wu Mei. “Sister-in-law, do you think Xiaoman is pregnant with a boy or a girl?” ”

Wu Mei shook her head. “Who can tell from her belly?”

“Yang Wenyin continued, “I heard that the one with the pointy belly is a boy, and the one with the round belly is a girl. I think Xiaoman’s belly is round, a little like a daughter!” ”

“Xia Xiaoman smiled and said, “Is that really true? Qingxuan has always wanted to give Lizi a sister so that she can have a partner in the future. If she really is a daughter, he will be very happy.” ”

“Zhang Zhenzhen continued, “Xiaoman, don’t even think about having a daughter! Our Lin family doesn’t have this gene!”She had tried several times but still couldn’t get a daughter as she wished. ”

Only Ye Shu was lucky enough to have both children in one child.

“”Isn’t Zhonghua a doctor?”Zhang Zhenzhen smiled and said, “Zhonghua, show your aunt whether she is a younger brother or a younger sister.” ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled slightly, “Second aunt, do you really think that my eyes are X-rays? !”! “It’s impossible to tell from the shape of my stomach. I have to go through a machine check.”. “Fourth uncle and fourth aunt, if you really want to know the gender, you can go to the hospital for a check-up.” ” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Lin Qingxuan walked over from the side. “There’s no need for a check-up. I like both men and women.”After all, he had waited half his life for this child. He had never even dreamed that.., he would have a child of his own in this life. ”

“Xia Xiaoman smiled very happily. Just like Lin Qingxuan, she had never thought that she would be able to find her own happiness after the divorce. She had never thought that a good man like Lin Qingxuan would exist in this world. ”

“In her previous life, Xia Xiaoman had been circling around an dongliang. It was only now that Xia Xiaoman felt that she had lived her true self. ”

“When two people who had been injured were reunited, they would definitely be able to overcome all their shortcomings and appreciate each other. ”

“Have you decided on the name of Your Child?”Wu Mei asked.

“Not yet.”Xia Xiaoman shook her head.

“Wu Mei continued, “You’re only three days away from your due date. You have to hurry up and decide on the name.” ”

“Okay.”

The dinner party ended at 9:30 pm.

“At the dining table, Cen Shaoqing was persuaded to drink some wine. He was a little tipsy at the moment. ”

“Ye Zhuo looked at Cen Shaoqing and said somewhat speechlessly, “If you can’t drink, then don’t try to be brave. Isn’t it uncomfortable to be drunk?” ”

Cen Shaoqing grabbed ye Zhuo’s hand. “I didn’t drink too much.”

Cen Shaoqing’s alcohol tolerance was quite good. It was just that he didn’t drink often. He suddenly drank so much wine and was a little tipsy.

“Besides, apart from a few children, even Lin Ze was his brother. He naturally couldn’t lose to others when it came to drinking. ”

“Ye Shu brought over a cup of sobering tea. “Shaoqing, are you alright?” ”

“”Auntie, I’m fine.”Cen Shaoqing immediately stood up from his chair. ”

“I heard that you drank quite a lot tonight.”Ye Shu handed him the cup. “Drink the sobering tea quickly.”

“”Thank you, Auntie.”Cen Shaoqing took the cup with both hands. ”

“How Many Cups did Shaoqing Drink Tonight?”Ye Shu looked at Ye Zao.

“I don’t know.”Ye Zao shook his head slightly.

“Cen Shaoqing drank the hangover tea and suddenly felt that his vision had become much clearer. “Auntie, I really didn’t drink much. Don’t worry.” ”

Ye Shu nodded. “Then let Zao take you home later.”

“”No need. I’ll get the driver to come over,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “We’re all family. There’s no need to be so polite.” ”

“”Thank you, Auntie.” ”

“Ye Shu knew that Cen Shaoqing would definitely feel uncomfortable with her around, so she went to the chess and card room on the third floor to play mahjong with a few sisters-in-law. ”

Cen Shaoqing only sat down after watching ye Shu’s back disappear at the corner of the stairs.

“Seeing him like this, Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly. “Are you so afraid of My Mother?” ”

Cen Shaoqing touched his nose. “How can I not be afraid of my future mother-in-law?”

“Cen Shaoqing had never been so timid in his entire life. Yet, he had broken all the rules at Ye Zhuo’s place. ”

“Seeing him like this, Ye Zhuo chuckled. ”

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “By the way, why isn’t Uncle Here Today?” ”

“Ye Zao said, “Uncle had something to do at the last minute.” ”

“Ye Sen had developed Shengdong Express very well, and his business had long since expanded overseas. He was usually very busy, and ye Zao had not seen him for a long time. ”

“After accompanying Cen Shaoqing to sober up for a while, ye Zao picked up the car keys on the table. “It’s getting late. Let me send you home.” ”

Cen Shaoqing grabbed ye Zao’s hand and stood up.

...

At the same time.

On the other side.

Mars.

“At present, the OASIS project was beginning to take effect. As far as the eye could see, the experimental field was green. ”

“Currently, the resources on Mars were enough for humans to survive on it. ”

“Fu Kang, a professor from the University of Agriculture, stood on the ridge of the field and looked into the distance. He smiled at the professor beside him and said, “Old Tian, Miss ye is really amazing! According to her method, the current germination rate of rice is already around 88% !” ”

“Old Tian was also a little surprised. He thought that ye Zao was just saying it casually. After all, Ye Zao did not come from the countryside and had never come into contact with agricultural knowledge. As a big shot in science and technology, how could she know agricultural knowledge, he did not expect that ye Zao was right! ”

“Heroes come from the youth. Miss ye let me understand the true meaning of this sentence.”

How Old Was Ye Zhuo?

She was only in her early twenties!

“When she was nineteen years old, she had already achieved a lot. This sentence was the most suitable to describe her. ”

No one noticed that a flying machine with a green light flashed past the horizon and finally disappeared in the northernmost direction.

Fu Kang took off his glasses and wiped them. He turned to look at Old Tian. “Did you notice that something seemed to fly past quickly?”

“Old Tian looked up at the sky and said, “No! Did you see it wrong?” ”

See It Wrong?

“Fu Kang put on his glasses again and said, “Maybe.”He was very short-sighted, so it was normal for him to see it wrong. ”

On the other side.

“In a high-tech room, a young woman in uniform stood in front of her desk, she looked at the middle-aged man sitting there and said, “Sir, I’ve found out that the person who brought those low-level humans to Mars to carry out the oasis project is called Ye Zhuo.” ”

“After saying that, the young woman activated the hidden button in the air, and a transparent screen immediately appeared in the air. “This is all of ye Zhuo’s information.” ”

The middle-aged man looked at the information on the screen and narrowed his eyes. “It’s her?”
