“At this point, doctor Wang added, “I know that Miss Ye has cured cancer, but everyone makes mistakes. Even Saints make mistakes, let alone Miss Ye.” ”

“Director Han pressed the report on the desk and looked up at Doctor Wang, “Doctor Wang, Miss Ye said that Weiwei’s malaria has not been detected because it is different from ordinary malaria, so naturally, it can not be examined according to the normal examination plan.” ”

“Hearing this, doctor Wang was a little angry. He tried his best to suppress the anger in his heart, then, he said, “Director Han, Weiwei’s symptoms are clearly not malaria. If we follow the information of the malaria plan, it will only aggravate Weiwei’s condition!” ”

“Director Han chuckled. “Old Wang, you’re really worrying too much. After all, Miss Ye is at the peak of the medical world. We should trust her.” ”

Pinnacle?

Could it be that the pinnacle would not make mistakes?

“Doctor Wang continued, “Director Han, I know that Miss Ye has created a record that ordinary people can not break, but that doesn’t mean that Miss Ye won’t make mistakes! Please believe me this time. Miss ye really made a mistake in her diagnosis this time!” ”

“That’s impossible!”Director Han said.

Doctor Wang just looked at director Han like that. There was an indescribable expression in his eyes.

He felt very uncomfortable.

“In the past, doctor Wang had never known what it meant to speak lightly. ”

“This time, he truly experienced it. ”

“Because his statement did not reach ye Zhuo’s level, no matter what he said, no one would agree with him. ”

“Doctor Wang calmed himself down. He looked up at director Han and said, “Director, I’ll be leaving first.” ”

“When he turned around, doctor Wang made a decision in his heart. ”

He had to prove himself.

Prove that he was not wrong.

“Director Han looked at Doctor Wang’s back and said, “Old Wang, don’t think too much. Let’s just cooperate with Miss Ye.” ”

Doctor Wang did not say anything and continued walking forward.

“Even when he returned home, doctor Wang was still unhappy. ” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“His wife, Zhang Hong, saw that something was wrong and asked him what was wrong. ”

Doctor Wang told the truth.

“When she heard this, Zhang Hong’s mouth was wide open. She asked in surprise, “Is it that Miracle Doctor Ye who cured cancer?” ”

“Yes.”Doctor Wang nodded.

“Zhang Hong continued, “After all, Miracle Doctor Ye is the first person to cure cancer. Since your director said so, there shouldn’t be any problems, right? You like to think about things.” ”

“Doctor Wang was already very depressed. Now that he saw that his wife still did not understand him, he felt even worse. ”

“I support the Army!”Doctor Wang’s mother walked out of the kitchen with a bowl of soup in her hand. “Come to the army. Drink a bowl of mung bean soup every day to relieve the heat.”

Doctor Wang took the bowl from his mother’s hand.

“Mother Wang continued, “Army, I believe you. What Miracle Doctor Ye or Miracle Doctor Ye? So what if she cured cancer? Curing cancer only means that she is an expert in oncology. In front of other outpatient clinics, she is nothing!” ”

“In mother Wang’s heart, her son was always right. ”

What Miracle Doctor Ye

“As long as it was a human, there would be flaws. ”

It was the same for Miracle Doctor Ye.

“Doctor Wang turned to look at his mother. “Mom, do you really believe in me?” ”

“Although his mother was not an expert in the medical field, at this moment, under the circumstances where no one believed in him, his mother’s trust was extremely precious. ”

Mother Wang nodded. “Of course I believe in You! I also support you to make some achievements. Let them see what kind of Bullsh * t Miracle Doctor Ye is. My Son is much more powerful than Miracle Doctor Ye.”

Ye Zhuo’s position in the medical field was already at the peak.

“If doctor Wang could surpass ye Zhuo to prove himself, then doctor Wang would be the new peak of the medical field. ”

Mother Wang had always believed in her son.

“At this point, mother Wang turned to look at doctor Wang and said, “Son, you have to make good use of this opportunity. This might be the turning point in your life.” ”

“Hearing this, doctor Wang’s eyes lit up. ”

“Zhang Hong was a little worried, “Mom, Miracle Doctor Ye is an authoritative figure. She must have her own reason for determining the cause of the illness. Da Jun is already a chief physician now. There’s no need to take this risk. If anything happens to him, his life will be over!” ”

“Upon hearing this, the queen mother was extremely unhappy. “Tell me, other than throwing cold water on the military, what else can you do? If it weren’t for you, the military would have long become the vice-president!” ”

Zhang Hong did not say anything else. It was obvious that she was in the wrong.
