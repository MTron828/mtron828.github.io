“After chatting about some other things, Feng Ying’s eyes rolled around and landed on the old lady’s wrist, she smiled and said, “Grandma, the Jade bracelet on your hand is really beautiful! The color is also not bad. Nowadays, it’s rare to see such good jade abroad.” ”

“The old lady reached out and took the bracelet off. “If you like it, I’ll give it to you. I’m old, I don’t need to wear these things anymore.” ”

“”Grandma, I remember this is your favorite bracelet. I Can’t take away someone’s love! By the way, I heard that you have a piece of plain jade, right?” ”

The plain jade was a family heirloom of the Feng family. It had been passed down from the hands of the Feng family’s old master for more than a thousand years.

“The old lady rarely mentioned the plain jade to others, but Feng Ying was not an outsider. ”

“Your mother told you about it?”

“”Yes.”Feng Ying nodded. “My mother said that the plain jade is quite magical, so I’m a little curious.” ”

“The old lady continued, “I do have this plain jade that was passed down from your great-grandfather, but I don’t know if it’s magical or not.” ”

So there really was one!

“Then can you let me see it?”Feng Ying continued to ask.

“Yes.”The old lady stood up from the chair and walked into the room.

Feng Ying Tiptoed as she looked at the old lady’s back. Her eyes were full of scheming light.

It was too easy!

She did not expect the old lady to be so gullible!

“In a moment, the old lady walked out of the room with a box in her hand. ”

“”Grandma, is Suyu Inside?” ”

“Yes.”The old lady nodded and reached out to open the box.

“As soon as she opened a crack, a bright light leaked out from inside, which was unusually dazzling. ”

“After the lid was opened, a piece of jade that was completely green could be seen lying inside the box. It was rectangular and not big, about the length of an index finger. ”

“”This is the plain jade,”the old lady said. ”

“Feng Ying’s eyes were full of surprise. She wanted to reach out to pick up the plain jade, but was stopped by the old lady. “This plain jade is different from ordinary jade. Don’t touch it with your hand.” ”

“”OH.”Feng Ying withdrew her hand and continued, “Grandma, I like the Jade too much. Can you give it to me?” ”

“”You’re my only granddaughter. Who else can I give it to if not you?”The old lady smiled and said, “But now is not the time. I still have to examine you for a while.” ” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Feng Ying hugged the old lady’s arm and began to act coquettishly. “Grandma, don’t worry. I promise I won’t let you down.” ”

“”Okay.”After all, she was the granddaughter that she had raised by herself, so the old lady was still very assured of Feng Ying. ”

Time passed very quickly.

“In the blink of an eye, more than half a month had passed. ”

“During this half a month, the old and the Young had a period of happiness. In the past half a month, Feng Ying did not mention the jade again, which made the old lady let down her guard, she was going to give Su Yu to Feng Ying in the next few days. ”

“She was old and could close her eyes at any time. Su Yu was such an important thing, so she could not lose it. It was better to give it to Feng Ying earlier. ”

“The old lady was watering the flowers while thinking about something, with a faint smile on her face. ”

“At this moment, Feng Ying’s phone suddenly rang. ”

“Looking at the back of the old lady watering the flowers in front, Feng Ying walked to the corner and picked up the phone. “Hello, Miss Tina.” ”

“”Miss Feng, we can’t wait any longer.” ”

“Feng Ying frowned slightly. “Miss Tina, I know you’re very anxious, but you can’t be in such a hurry. My grandmother has promised to leave Suyu to me. Don’t worry, I’ll bring Suyu back to China as soon as possible.” ”

The old lady was about to go back to the house to discuss the matter of Suyu with Feng Ying when she heard Feng Ying’s voice on the phone.

There seemed to be something wrong with her voice.

The old lady held her breath and listened to their conversation.

“”Miss Tina, my grandmother is a very trustworthy person. Besides, I’m her only granddaughter. Who else can she give her jade to besides me? “I can’t guarantee the exact time, but I can guarantee that as soon as I get the Jade, I’ll send it to you immediately.” ”

“After hearing this, the old lady was stunned and her face turned pale. ”

She did not expect that Feng Ying had been acting with her for the past few days.

She also did not expect that Feng Ying had been in contact with C Nation.

“Now, it seemed that Gamila had come for the jade. ”

It seemed that there must be other secrets hidden in the jade.

“Otherwise, the people of C Nation would not try so hard to get the jade. ”

No!

She could not let the jade fall into the hands of these pirates.

“Thinking of this, the old lady took a deep breath and tried her best to calm herself down. She walked upstairs and took out the jade from her bedroom. ”

“After taking out the jade, the old lady went downstairs. ”

“Feng Ying had just finished her phone call. Seeing that the old lady looked like she was going out, she asked, “Grandmother, are you going out? I’ll accompany you.” ”

“”No need.”The old lady smiled and said, “I’m just going out for a walk. You Don’t have to follow me.” ”

“Feng Ying just happened to have her own little plan, so she said, “Okay, then you be careful on the road. If there’s anything, call me.” ”

“Okay.”The old lady nodded.

“After the old lady left, Feng Ying went to the old lady’s bedroom and rummaged through the cabinets to find something. ”

Tina could not wait any longer!

“Therefore, she had to steal the jade. ”

“On this side, the old lady came to the entrance of the CEN family’s experimental base. Just as she was about to enter, she was stopped by the security team. “Please Show me your identification.” ”

“The old lady raised her head to look at the security team. “My surname is Feng, and I’m Feng Qi’s mother. I want to see your Miss Ye. Please tell her that I have an important matter to look for her.” ”

“Hearing that it was professor Feng’s mother, the head of the guards did not dare to be careless. “Okay, please wait a moment. I’ll go and inform her right away.” ”
