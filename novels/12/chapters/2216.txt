Translator: 549690339

“”Blame it on us for seeing the wrong person! I used to think that she was a good person! She is worse than man Xing!”Fan Mu was angry at the thought of ye Zao’s attitude, “Man Wen has done so much for her. I don’t believe that she doesn’t know anything. As long as she has some conscience, she shouldn’t be like that!” ”

“Man Wen sincerely treated ye Zao as his sister, so he always thought of ye Zao. ”

But what about ye Zao?

“Ye Zao was a vicious snake, cold-blooded and merciless! ”

“Then what should we do now?”Wen Yang asked.

Fan Mu was at a loss. How would he know what to do! !

“After a moment, fan mu continued, “Let’s not panic for now. The law will always be in place. Man Wen has never done those things. I don’t believe that they can lock him up for Life!” ”

“Wen Yang sighed. “Unless Sun Xiaowen can tell the truth, otherwise...” ”

The crux of the problem now was Sun Xiaowen.

“Upon hearing Sun Xiaowen, fan mu continued to ask, “Who are the people in Sun Xiaowen’s Family?” ”

“Wen Yang said, “Sun Xiaowen is a son-in-law. He has been married to his wife, Zhao meiting, for three months. He doesn’t seem to have any relatives on his side. It was said that Zhao meiting’s parents didn’t like Sun Xiaowen very much. However, Sun Xiaowen had no choice but to marry him. Under the circumstances, his parents had no choice but to agree to this matter.” ” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Fan Mu narrowed his eyes. “Can we start from Zhao Meiting’s side?”

“”It might not be possible,”wen yang continued, “Ever since Sun Xiaowen was arrested, the Zhao family has been imprisoned.” ”

Wen Yang and fan mu sighed.

It didn’t work this way or that. Could it be that man Wen could only wait for death?

In the small dark room.

Man Wen was sitting on the ground resting. Little did he know that an ice-cold snake had already crawled into his pants.

“In the next second, a piercing pain spread throughout his entire body. ”

“The piercing pain gradually turned into numbness. Then, man Wen closed his eyes and fainted just like that. ”

On the day of the trial.

The news of Man Wen committing suicide due to guilt had spread throughout the entire star network.

“When she heard the news, man Xing was not surprised at all. However, she still pretended to be surprised and stood in front of the camera with red eyes, “Wen ‘er, I don’t know why you are doing this! Don’t you even want to defend yourself?” ”

“The people of Manxing expressed that although man Wen was already dead, the trial still had to continue. ”

Even if they had to carry Manwen’s body up.

“The trial was broadcasted live on the Internet. In less than an hour, the online audience had already reached 100,000 people! ”

“Moreover, the number of people was still increasing. ”

There were also quite a number of people who came.

The judge stood on the stage and tapped the small hammer in his hand. “Silence.”

The originally noisy environment instantly quieted down.

“Although Manwen was no longer conscious, the judge still went through all the procedures and pronounced Manwen’s crime on the spot. ”

“”This court sentences Manwen to have murdered his biological parents. His modus operandi is extremely vile. Although he committed suicide because he was afraid of his crime, in order to appease the anger of the people, he is to be beaten to death!” ”

“”Wait!”At this moment, a clear voice suddenly came from the entrance. ”

Everyone looked up and saw a slender figure slowly walking over.

White clothes and black pants.

It was a little cold to look at.

“”Miss Ye?”The judge looked at Ye Zhuo. “Miss Ye, do you have any questions?” ”

“”Who said that man Wen committed suicide out of guilt?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly. “I have evidence to prove that man Wen did not commit suicide out of guilt. Furthermore, he is innocent!” ”

“The judge continued, “Miss Ye, man Wen is already dead. His body is over there.” ”

Ye Zao walked over and stretched out his hand to check his breath.

Man Wen had indeed lost his breath.

“However, because ye Zao had been prepared in the past, man Wen did not die. He had only entered a state of suspended animation. ”

“A moment later, ye Zao poured out a black pill from the small bottle that he carried with him. ”

“Holding the pill in his left hand, he opened man Wen’s mouth with his right hand and fed the pill into his mouth. ”

“In less than three seconds, man Wen frowned and opened his eyes. ”

“”M-miss ye?”Seeing ye Zao, man Wen thought he was hallucinating. ”

He didn’t expect that the first thing he saw when he opened his eyes after he fainted was actually Miss Ye.

“Do you feel any discomfort now?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“No.”Man Wen shook his head.

“”That’s good.”Ye Zhuo continued, “Get up first.” ”

“”Miss Ye, I, I didn’t do those things!”Man Wen said. ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “I know. Don’t worry. I came here today to clear your name.”
