“This way, it was just enough to clean up the LIN Group!”

“Zhou Dawei looked at Lin Jincheng, his eyes full of disdain.”

Lin Jincheng’s move was a desperate struggle.

“At this moment, Zhou Dawei’s gaze fell on Lin Jincheng’s hand, and the disdain in his eyes became even more obvious.”

What was Lin Jincheng holding in his hand?

He was actually holding the black card given by Ye Zao.

No wonder Lin Jincheng was so confident all of a sudden.

“He couldn’t really think that the card given by ye Zao would work, right?”

Ridiculous!

This was too ridiculous!

“Indeed, like father, like daughter.”

“Ye Zao was just an idiot. As Ye Zao’s father, how could Lin Jincheng be any better?”

Clap! Clap! Clap

“Zhou Dawei raised his hand and clapped. “Good! Good! That’s great! Jincheng, what you said was very good. I hope that when the Lin Group declares bankruptcy, you can still be so arrogant!””

“Lin Jincheng raised his head and looked at Zhou Dawei. At this moment, ye Zao’s cool face appeared in front of his eyes.”

“It seemed that no matter what, Ye Zao was always calm and collected.”

“His daughter was so outstanding, so as a father, he naturally could not hold her back!”

“A smile appeared on Lin Jincheng’s face. “Uncle Zhou, you want to see the LIN Group declare bankruptcy? I’m afraid you won’t be able to wait until that day!””

Zhou Dawei nodded. “Really? Then what if I Do?”

“At this time, Lin Jincheng was still so confident!”

Just wait!

“No matter how confident Lin Jincheng was now, he would regret it when the time came!”

“”Then, just wait.””

Zhou Dawei did not waste any more time talking to Lin Jincheng. He turned around and looked at the people behind him. “Let’s go.”

The group of people followed behind Zhou Dawei in an imposing manner and walked out.

“The secretary said somewhat anxiously, “Director Lin, what should we do now?””

Lin Jincheng narrowed his eyes. “Get the personnel department to blacklist all the people who left the company today.”

“”Okay.”The secretary continued, “I’ll do it right away.””

“Lin Jincheng stood where he was, feeling a little dizzy.”

“Facing the LIN Group now, not only was there a huge funding gap, but there was also a loss of talent.”

Could it be that.

The Lin Group was really going to be destroyed by him?

“At this moment, Lin Jincheng suddenly thought of the black card that ye Zhuo had given him.”

He hoped that the money in the card could solve the urgent problem.

“Lin Jincheng came to the bank, intending to check how much money was in this card.”

“Seeing the number on the bank card, Lin Jincheng was immediately stunned.”

A full 14 digits.

This was the small amount of money that ye Zhuo had mentioned?

“Although he had long known that the money in this card was definitely a lot, he had not expected that it would actually be 14 digits.”

No wonder ye Zhuo said so confidently that she would fill in the remaining capital gaps.

With this amount of money.

“Not only would the LIN Group be able to live peacefully, it would also be able to smoothly open up the foreign market!”

...

The matter of the five old shareholders of the LIN Group withdrawing their capital together was quickly found out by Old Lady Lin.

Old Lady Lin sat on the sofa with a smug smile on her face.

She knew that these old shareholders would definitely avenge her!

“These old shareholders had followed Old Master Lin all the way here. Now that her sister-in-law was being bullied by a junior like Lin Jincheng, they definitely wouldn’t let Lin Jincheng off.”

“Next, Lin Jincheng should come and beg her.”

“Thinking of this, Old Lady Lin was extremely happy. It was as if she could already see Lin Jincheng humbly humoring her in front of her.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Originally, Old Lady Lin only wanted Lin Jincheng to bring her and Feng Xianxian back.”

“But now, she couldn’t!”

She had to divorce Lin Jincheng and ye Shu.

She had to get ye Shu to take ye Zhuo and get out of the Lin Family!

“Ye Shu was a jinx. Ever since she and Lin Jincheng got back together, the Lin family had never had a peaceful day.”

Old Lady Lin had already thought it through.

“After Lin Jincheng and ye Shu divorced, she would personally help Lin Jincheng choose a well-educated and reasonable young lady.”

“Feng Xianxian walked out of the room. When she saw Old Lady Lin like this, she smiled and said, “Grandma, what happened? Why Are You So Happy?””

Old Lady Lin raised her head and looked at Feng Xianxian. “You’ll know when you look at the stock market situation of the LIN Group.”

Stock market situation?

Feng Xianxian narrowed her eyes and immediately took out her phone. She opened the official website of the LIN Group and the stock market.

“One wouldn’t know if one didn’t look, but one would be shocked.”

“The Lin Group’s stock had actually dropped by five points in a short period of time, and now it was still in a straight line of decline.”

It looked like it was about to hit the limit!

It looked like the Lin group must have suffered some serious damage!

“Otherwise, it wouldn’t have become like this overnight.”
