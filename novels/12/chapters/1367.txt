“Do I look awful?”Xie wanqiu touched her face and looked up at Zhou Zuolong.

“Zhou Zuolong nodded. “Yes, it looks awful. Do you want me to call the doctor over to take a look?” ”

“”No, no need,”Xie Wanqiu said. “I’m fine. I don’t feel unwell anywhere.” ”

What should he do?

Was there any way to make Zhou Zuolong leave the ward?

“As long as Zhou Zuolong was in this ward, Wu Youyu would not be able to leave. ”

“If this continued, Zhou Zuolong would definitely discover Wu Youyu. ”

“Xie wanqiu became more and more flustered. Her mind was a mess. For a moment, she could not think of anything. ”

“Wu Youyu, who was under the bed, was also very uncomfortable. ”

“Firstly, it was because the space under the bed was too cramped. Secondly, it was because she was nervous and afraid. ”

“Once Zhou Zuolong found out about his affair with Xie wanqiu, they would be finished. Their nearly 30 years of deployment would go down the drain in an instant. ”

Therefore.

They must not be discovered by Zhou Zuolong.

“Wu Youyu pressed his palms together and muttered softly, “Bodhisattva bless, Bodhisattva bless!” ”

“At this moment, Zheng Wanyin walked to Zhou Zuolong’s side with a smile, “Grandpa, the Doctor said that we should take grandma out to bask in the sun more often. The weather outside is pretty good today. Why Don’t you take Grandma Out for a walk in the garden? I’ll go out to buy some food. I’ll call you guys when I get back.” ”

“Xie wanqiu heaved a sigh of relief. At this critical moment, her biological granddaughter was still the most reliable. “Yinyin is right. I just want to go out for a walk and breathe some fresh air. The ward is almost suffocating.” ”

“As Xie Wanqiu spoke, she walked out again and again. ”

“Zhou Zuolong nodded and followed Xie Wanqiu’s footsteps. “Alright, let’s go out for a walk then.” ”

“Okay.”

The two of them walked out of the ward.

“When they reached the door, Xie Wanqiu turned back to take a look at the ward. ”

“Under the bed, Wu Youyu was still lying there. ”

“After Xie Wanqiu and Zhou Zuolong left, Zheng Wanyin also left the ward. ”

“Hearing the sound of footsteps getting further and further away, Wu Youyu, who was hiding under the bed, seemed to have collapsed. He let out a heavy breath and lay on the ground. There was actually a feeling of ecstasy as if he had escaped death. ”

“He had left. Zhou Zuolong had finally left, ”

“today, he had nearly capsized in the gutter. ”

“After a long while, Wu Youyu finally crawled out from under the bed. Dragging his tired footsteps, he walked out of the door. ”

Creak —

The door was pushed open.

“Wu Youyu looked outside the door. After confirming that Zhou Zuolong and the others were not outside, he dared to continue walking forward. ” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“”Miss Ye, we’ve really troubled you this time. If it wasn’t for you, we really wouldn’t know what to do.” ”

“At this moment, a group of people in deep white coats walked over. ”

“They were all wearing masks. Although their faces could not be seen clearly, they could still see that the person walking in front had a graceful figure. His porcelain-white skin was almost transparent under the light. ”

“The wide mask covered his face, leaving only a pair of phoenix-like eyes that were full of spirit energy. This caused everyone to turn around and look at the Prime Minister. ”

“Is the sterile room ready?”Ye Zhuo looked back slightly and looked at the director beside him.

“The director said respectfully, “Don’t worry, it’s all ready.” ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. His gaze inadvertently swept past the side and saw a figure sneakily walking out of Xie Wanqiu’s ward.

“Ye Zao was well-versed in psychology. With a glance, he could tell that there was something wrong with this person. ”

Cen Shaoqing’s grandmother was not a particular person.

Ye Zao subconsciously felt that this sneaky figure was definitely inextricably linked to Xie wanqiu.

It was not until he walked out of the hospital gate that Wu Youyu truly felt that he had come back to life.

In the hospital’s back garden.

Xie wanqiu and Zhou Zuolong chatted as they walked.

“Although she was chatting with Zhou Zuolong, Xie Wanqiu’s heart was not with Zhou Zuolong. When they were chatting, it was like the head of a fish did not match the horse’s mouth. ”

She was now very worried about Wu Youyu.

“Wanqiu? Wanqiu?”

Zhou zuolong stretched out his hand and waved it in front of Xie Wanqiu.

“Only then did Xie wanqiu react. She smiled and said, “Old Man, What’s Wrong?” ”

“Zhou zuolong asked curiously, “What’s wrong with you today? Why are you so absent-minded? Are you not feeling well? It’s so cold outside. Why Don’t we go back first?” ”

Go Back? !

What if Wu Youyu was still in the ward when they went back?

No.

They couldn’t go back.

“Xie wanqiu continued, “Let’s walk around for a while. I’m not feeling unwell. I’m just a little worried about Xiang Xiang. When you went to Xiang Xiang’s place today, what did Xiang Xiang Say?” ”

It turned out that Xie Wanqiu was worried about Zhou Xiang.
