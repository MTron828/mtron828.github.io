“As a younger sister, Bai Jingfei was also very envious of Bai Jingshu. ”

“Zheng zhizhi continued, “Such a good thing can only happen to your sister. Back then, Ye Han was the first to introduce Lin Ze to Bai Mo, and Bai Mo had a shallow eye for Lin Ze. However, it’s not Bai Mo’s fault. If I were Bai Mo, I would also look down on Lin Ze, who was only an Earthling back then! Therefore, such things couldn’t be envied at all! “There’s always something in life, but there’s always something in life that can’t be forced!” ”

“Bai Jingfei was also filled with emotions. “Who says so! Back then, my parents and the others even wanted to sever ties with my sister because of this matter. Now, they must be regretting it to death!” ”

The matter of severing ties with Bai Jingzhu back then had caused quite a stir. It could be said that everyone in the s galaxy knew about it.

“Zheng zhizhi continued, “I think Bai Mo should be the one who regrets it the most. After all, she was so close to becoming the future mistress of the Shangguan Family!” ”

“Without even thinking, it was obvious that Bai Mo must be extremely regretful right now. ”

“Bai jingfei nodded. “That’s true, but it’s useless even if she regrets it now. It’s her fault for not cherishing Lin ze properly back then. Lin Ze is now my sister’s!” ”

“Zheng Zhizhi held Bai Jingfei’s arm and continued, “Jingfei, I really admire your sister now. She’s practically the chosen one! If I had half her luck, I wouldn’t have ended up like this!” ”

Bai Jingshu was really lucky!

Everyone was waiting to see her make a fool of herself. They didn’t expect that those who were waiting to see her make a fool of themselves would turn into a joke.

“”Actually, I still feel that it’s quite unreal,”Bai jingfei continued, “Tell me, how did my sister become the future mistress of the Shangguan Family?” ”

“Yes, it was very unreal! ”

“However, Bai Jingfei was also happy for Bai Jingzhu from the bottom of her heart. ”

“Zheng zhizhi continued, “Then from now on, you’ll be the sister-in-law of the Shangguan family! Jingfei, I have to hug your thigh properly! I Can’t let you run away. You have to bring me to show off and bring me to fly!” ”

“The social circle was different now, and their interactions would also be upgraded. ”

“In the future, the people Bai Jingfei met would be a few levels higher than her. If Zheng Zhizhi continued to follow Bai Jingfei, their interactions would also be upgraded. ”

“Bai jingfei smiled and said, “It’s not like you don’t know my relationship with my sister. It’s as cold as ice.” ”

She did not expect Bai Jingshu’s marriage to change her fate.

“After experiencing some things, Bai Jingfei understood many things. ”

“Some things did not belong to you, and you could not snatch them away. It was better to leave it to fate and let nature take its course. ”

“Zheng zhizhi continued, “But she’s your sister after all! Between you two sisters, she has to support you.” ”

“Bai Jingfei smiled. “Let nature take its course. Oh right, did you come here to tell me about this?” ”

“Yes.”

On the other side.

Bai Jiacheng and Zhou Ying rushed to the Bai family’s old mansion.

“The door of the old mansion was pasted with the bright word ‘double happiness’, and red ribbons were scattered on the ground. Obviously, the bride had been taken away. ”

“Seeing this scene, Bai Jiacheng was extremely anxious. He immediately ran into the house. “Dad! Dad!” ”

Zhou Ying followed Bai Jiacheng’s footsteps.

“Most of the guests from the Bai family had left, leaving elder Bai alone in the living room. He was sitting there alone, smoking his cigarette. ”

“Bai Jiasheng immediately ran over. “Dad, why are you alone? Where’s Jingshu? Where are the others?”Most importantly, where was his good son-in-law? Where was Lin Ze! ”

Why was Lin Ze gone!

Where did Lin ze go?

Elder Bai looked up at Bai Jiasheng with a mocking look in his eyes. “Does Jingshu still have anything to do with you two? Didn’t you guys disown this daughter a long time ago?”

“Elder Bai had a good reputation throughout his life. He had never done anything wrong in his life, but how did he give birth to such a son? ! ”

It was his son’s fault for not teaching his father. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

It was his fault!

It was all his fault!

“When he heard this, Bai Jiacheng was extremely agitated. “Dad, you can’t say that! No matter what, Jingshu is my daughter! Even if we break her bones, we’re still connected! As long as Jingshu is my daughter, then Lin Ze is my son-in-law!” ”

“”That’s right!”Zhou Ying followed up. “Jingshu was born to me after ten months of hard work. We’re mother and daughter, how can we just break up like that?” ”

“Elder Bai slammed the table and stood up, “You were the ones who wanted to break up with Jingshu in the beginning, and now, you’re the ones who shamelessly begged her! Do you think Jingshu is an item? You can throw her away if you want to, and pick her up when you want to! Ask Yourself, do you deserve to be a parent?” ”
