“At the end of her sentence, Bai Jingshu looked up at Lin ze and asked, “Will you favor boys over girls in the future?” ”

“I won’t.”Lin Ze shook his head. “I don’t care if it’s a boy or a girl. We only want one.”

“”But I like it lively. Let’s have two,”Bai Jingshu said. ”

Lin Ze smiled. “As long as you’re happy.”

“Bai Jingshu continued to ask, “What about your parents? Will they mind if we have two daughters?” ”

“”I can’t promise anyone else, but don’t worry. My parents won’t Do That!”Lin Ze said. ”

“”Really?”Perhaps it had something to do with the environment they grew up in, Bai Jingshu couldn’t believe what Lin Ze said. ”

“Lin Ze turned to look at Bai Jingshu. “If you don’t believe me, I can write you a guarantee.” ”

“Bai Jingshu chuckled. “There’s no need for a guarantee. However, I still find it hard to believe that there are parents in this world who don’t value boys over girls.” ”

“Did you notice a problem?”Lin Ze asked in return.

“What problem?”Bai Jingshu asked.

“Lin Ze continued, “In my generation, including my previous generation and the next generation, there are no girls other than searing and Lizi?” ” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Bai Jingshu also reacted and said in surprise, “I think so!” ”

“Lin Ze said, “Actually, strictly speaking, the Lin family only had one girl, burning, in my generation. “Our family is very strange. Everyone only gives birth to boys and not girls. I hope you can break this balance!” ”

“Lin ze paused and continued, “So girls are very rare in our family. If you can give birth to a girl, you will definitely be treated like a panda!” ”

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “Really?” ”

“”Of course it’s true.”Lin Ze continued, “If you don’t believe me, you’ll know when you marry into our family.” ”

“Bai Jingshu blushed and said, “Who wants to marry you!” ”

“Lin Ze put his arm around Bai Jingshu’s shoulder. “What should I do? If you don’t marry me, won’t I be single for the rest of my life?” ”

...

On the other side.

Elder Bai stood at the door and watched Bai Jingshu and Lin Ze leave. He didn’t leave for a long time.

“When Bai Jingshu didn’t have a boyfriend, elder Bai was in a hurry to get her to find a boyfriend. Now that she had a boyfriend, elder Bai was a little worried ”

He couldn’t bear to part with her.

“After all, Bai Jingshu was his granddaughter from a young age. When he thought about how she was going to get married soon, elder Bai felt empty in his heart and very sad. ”

“”Si Feng!”At this moment, a voice suddenly came from the air. ”

“Old Master Bai turned around and saw the person who had come. He smiled and asked, “When did you come back?” ”

“The person who had come was about the same age as Old Master Bai. She had silver-white hair, and although she was already in her seventies or eighties, she looked very energetic. ”

“This was the elder sister of one of Old Master Bai’s siblings, Bai Sanfeng. ”

“Bai Sanfeng rebuked, “You just came back! And now you don’t even tell me what’s going on at home!” ”

“What didn’t I tell you?”Old Master Bai was a little confused.

“What did you say?”Bai Sanfeng asked.

Old Master Bai seemed to have thought of something. “You mean about Jingshu and Lin Ze?”

“You didn’t even tell me about my niece’s major life event! What do you mean by that?”Bai Sanfeng questioned.

“Elder bai said unhurriedly, “I didn’t inform you because I knew that you would definitely not approve of this! Furthermore, even if I didn’t inform you, wouldn’t you know by now?” ”

“”You also know that I don’t approve?”Just like elder Bai, Bai Sanfeng also liked Bai Jingshu very much. “Let me ask you, is Jingshu still your biological granddaughter? You actually want to harm her like this!” ”

“Lin Ze was just a very ordinary earthling. Even if he were to find a random person to marry in Galaxy S, it would still be better than marrying Lin Ze. ”

Who knew what her younger brother was thinking!

“If Bai Jingshu really married Lin Ze, it would be no different from lowering her status. Bai Jingshu was beautiful and had many suitors in Galaxy S. in Bai Sanfeng’s opinion, Bai Jingshu deserved better! ”

“Elder Bai knew what his sister meant and continued, “Actually, Lin Ze is a very good young man. Jingshu likes him very much. As his elders, we should give him our blessings.” ”

“Bai Sifeng! Look at what you’re saying! Is this what a grandfather should say?”Bai Sanfeng was so angry that her face was pale!

“Bai Sanfeng’s impression of Earth was very bad. She felt that Earth was a living hell. As Bai Jingshu’s great aunt, she would never let Bai Jingshu marry into earth! ”

“Old Master Bai took a deep breath. “Elder sister, I know that you’re doing this for Jingshu’s good. Just like you, I also hope that Jingshu can live a happy life! Believe me, although Lin Ze is an earthling, he will never disappoint!” ”

It had been a long time since old master bai had called Bai Sanfeng “Elder sister”. The reason why he called her that was because he hoped that Bai Sanfeng could calm down.

“However, how could Bai Sanfeng calm down now? Whenever she thought about how Bai Jingshu was entangled with an earthling, she would feel extremely uncomfortable! ”

“Bai Sanfeng pointed at old master bai and said, “I’m just asking you. He’s only an earthling. What right does he have to give Jingshu Happiness? Jingshu is still young. It’s fine if she’s not sensible, but aren’t you sensible as well?” ”

“”Calm down,”old master bai continued, “I’m Jingshu’s biological grandfather. I want her to be happy more than you do. You have to believe in my choice, and you have to believe in Jingshu’s choice even more.” ”

“Bai Sanfeng wished she could slap old master Bai Awake. “You’re not doing this for Jingshu’s own good. You’re harming Jingshu! If you’re really doing this for Jingshu’s own good, then make Jingshu break off from that Earthling immediately!” ”

“At this point, Bai Sanfeng paused for a moment before continuing, “I still have a few high-quality young men here, and they come from good families. They can help Jingshu look at each other. Jingshu is indeed old enough.” ”

“Bai Sanfeng had actually wanted to be a matchmaker for Bai Jingshu for a long time, but Bai Jingshu had always said that she was not in a hurry to find a boyfriend. Bai Sanfeng had really thought that Bai Jingshu did not want to find a boyfriend, but who would have thought that in the blink of an eye.., bai Jingshu had already started a conversation with an earthling! ”

“If she had known this would happen, she would have introduced a boyfriend to Bai Jingshu earlier. If she had introduced a boyfriend to Bai Jingshu earlier, Bai Jingshu wouldn’t have been delayed by an earthling. ”

“Old Master Bai looked at Bai sanfeng and continued, “SIS, you really don’t have to worry about this matter. Jingshu is doing very well now. Even if everyone opposes them, I support them!” ”

“Bai Sanfeng suppressed the anger in her heart. “If I’m not worried, who’s going to worry? I’m counting on you, and you’re going to hand Jingshu over to that kind of person?” ”

“The moment Bai Jingshu returned, she saw Bai Sanfeng and old master Bai arguing until their faces were red. ”

Bai Sanfeng was especially furious. She wanted to point at Old Master Bai’s face and scold him.

“”Great-aunt, you’re here! Not long ago, grandfather was still talking about you!”Bai Jingshu walked over and held Bai Sanfeng’s hand. ”
