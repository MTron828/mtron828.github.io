“Then, he turned to look at Ye Han and continued to introduce, “This is first uncle, this is second uncle, this is third uncle and second uncle.” ”

“Ye Han faced everyone and greeted them politely, “First uncle, second uncle, third uncle, fourth uncle, seniors, Hello. I Am Ye Han, Mu Ye, cold and cold.” ”

“The four brothers of the Lin family looked at Ye Han, their eyes full of sizing him up. ”

“After a moment, Lin Qingxuan smiled and said, “Ye Han, how old are you this year?” ”

“”Fourth uncle, I am nineteen this year,”ye Han replied. ”

“If it was in the past, Lin Qingxuan would definitely have lamented that ye Han had such an aura at such a young age. ”

“But now, ever since he saw the perverts of Ye Zhuo and Lin Ze, he was no longer surprised. ”

“After all, those who followed ye Zhuo were all ordinary people. ”

The Lin brothers were very amiable and gave ye Han red packets each.

“That night, ye Hanguang received red packets and his hands went soft. ”

Life on Earth was completely different from what he had imagined.

“In his impression, earth was no different from purgatory. Only after experiencing it personally did he realize that life on Earth was far more interesting than life in the s galaxy, Changyue. ”

Just the human touch alone was more than enough for Changyue.

“Perhaps it was because the technological civilization was developing too quickly, or perhaps it was because the changyue country was so vast that the people of Changyue got along with each other very coldly. ”

“On Earth, he saw a warmth that he had never seen before. ”

“After receiving the red packets, Lin Ze stuffed a few more red packets to Ye Han. “Take this. It will be useful in a while.” ”

“”What’s the use?”Ye Han asked, puzzled. ”

“Lin Ze continued, “In a while, a few grandsons of uncles and uncles will come over. There are six of them in total. You still have to give them red packets.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Han nodded.

“Lin Ze added, “According to the backup, they should call you uncle fourteen.” ”

“Uncle?”Ye Han was stunned. He did not expect ye Zhuo to have such a high seniority in the family.

“Lin Ze nodded and said with a smile, “Doesn’t uncle’s grandson have to call you uncle? Our father is the youngest in our family. The eldest grandson of the eldest uncle’s family is almost twenty years old. However, he is studying abroad and is not here today.” ”

“Ye Han was still unable to react. He continued, “Does that mean that if the eldest grandson of the eldest uncle’s family has a child, he has to call me uncle and grandfather?” ”

“This child is worth teaching.”Lin Ze nodded. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Their seniority in the Lin family was neither too big nor too small.

“As expected, the six children quickly arrived. They scrambled to greet ye Han. “Hello, Uncle Fourteen!” ”

“Uncle Fourteen is really handsome!”

“In the Lin family, Ye Zhuo was ranked twelfth while an Lizi was thirteenth. Naturally, Ye Han became Uncle Fourteen. ”

Ye Han’s face was slightly red from being praised. He patted the heads of the little guys one by one and then gave them red packets.

The little guys who received the red packets were even sweeter.

One of the little guys even directly said that he wanted to introduce a girlfriend to Ye Han.

“Lele continued, “It just so happens that Aunt Lizi doesn’t have a boyfriend either. Why don’t we introduce Aunt Lizi to uncle 14th!” ”

“”No, no.”Duan Duan immediately waved his small hands and said, “My grandmother said that relatives and relatives are not allowed to get married!” ”

“Lele pouted and asked in puzzlement, “Why Duck?” ”

“Duan Duan was only eight years old this year. How would he know why? He slapped his younger brother on the head and said, “Mom said that adults say that children are not allowed to interfere in matters! Where did you get so many WHYS!” ”

“OH.”Lele nodded reluctantly.

“Ye Han and Lin Ze stood up. At that moment, Xia Xiaoman walked over with little Lin Zhi in her arms. ”

“Lin Ze smiled and greeted, “Fourth aunt.” ”

“Ye Han also greeted, “Hello, fourth aunt.” ”

“Xia Xiaoman said, “Little Zhi, quickly call me big brother. There are two big brothers here. One is Big Brother ZE, and the other is Big Brother Han.” ”

Big Brother?

“Ye Han was stunned again. He was just an uncle, but he had become a big brother so quickly... ”

And the other party was such a young child.

“This seniority was like a roller coaster, up and down. ”

“So Big that he had to be a grandfather, and so small that he was still a big brother... ... ”

“Ye Han was only stunned for a moment, but he quickly reacted. He took out a red packet from his pocket and handed it to Lin Zhi. “This is a greeting gift for your little brother.” ”

“Xia Xiaoman smiled and said, “Xiao Han, you’re too polite! Xiao Zhi, quickly thank your older brother.” ”

“Xiao Lin Zhi was only a little over a year old. He was still in the teething stage and would not say anything too complicated for the time being. At the moment, he would only call her elder sister. Therefore, when Xia Xiaoman asked him to say thank you, he was also talking about elder sister. ”
