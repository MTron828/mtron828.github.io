Chapter 136: 083: great abuse of SCUM, delightful! Great Motherly Love 2

She was ye Zao’s grandmother.

Even if ye Zao was crippled, no one could do anything to her!

An honest official could not resolve family affairs!

Ye Zao grabbed the feather duster. It looked like he was grabbing it lightly, but Yao Cuifen could not pull it no matter how hard she tried, “Old Woman! I’m warning you, this is my home! I only have one uncle, his name is Ye Sen! If you say something like this, don’t blame me for being rude!”

Ye Zhuo had always respected the elderly.

Because in her previous life, her life was saved by a strange old woman.

But in the face of Yao Cuifen’s shameless face, she couldn’t respect it no matter what.

In the face of ye Zhuo’s face, Yao Cuifen was angry and afraid.

That kind of fear was born spontaneously.

She couldn’t control it at all.

It was really heaven-defying!

No matter what, she was ye Zhuo’s grandmother. Ye Zhuo was a junior, yet she dared to yell at her.

Does she have a grandmother in her heart?

At once she took out her special skill and threw herself on the ground, crying and shouting, “Somebody Help! Come and have a look! My granddaughter hit my grandma! I’m getting beat up by a kid at my age! I’m not gonna Live! Dead! You Goddamned Little Bitch! The old tramp has no shame and gives birth to a tramp that no one wants! You killed someone... <per_0> . .”

Ye Dafu banged the table and sang along with Yao Cuifen on the ground, “Bad Luck at home! Bad Luck at home! How dare I raise such an unfilial daughter! Even his own parents! Jesus Christ! Why Don’t you just let us die! What else do you want us to do in this world? UNFILIAL daughter! You’ll be damned!”

Ye Shu looked at her parents in front of her.

She thought of all the past events and could not help but tear up her eyes.

When she was young, her father did not love her, and her mother did not love her. She was brought up by her grandmother before she was 11 years old.

At her grandmother’s house, she had a happy childhood.

Later, her grandmother passed away.

Her parents only then picked her up and brought her home, and her tragic death began at this time.

The year that she was picked up by her parents, she was only in fifth grade. But after her parents picked her up, her parents did not let her continue to go to school.

Because her first two sisters and one brother.

The family can not afford to send too many children to school.

11-year-old kid, under five feet tall.

Not only to go to the small workshop every day to do casual workers, but also responsible for washing and cooking...

They eat worse than pigs.

Get Up earlier than the dog, go to bed later than the cat...

Ye Dafu and Yao Cuifen are her parents.

They had not done their duty as parents for a single day!

Ye Shu clenched her fists. “What on Earth are you trying to do! ?”

These words.

Ye Shu roared angrily.

Her voice drowned out the voices of everyone in the room.

The air suddenly became quiet.

Even Yao Cuifen stopped howling.

She raised her head to look at Ye Shu. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Ye Shu said in a stifled voice, “What on earth do you want to do before you’re willing to let me go!”

If she had a choice.

She would rather not come to this world!

Lin Xiaowei smiled and said, “Xiaoshu, since you’ve already said it like this, then let’s speak frankly!”Since they had already fallen out, there was no need to continue pretending.

Yao Cuifen quickly got up from the ground. “Right, let’s speak frankly!”

Lin Xiaowei continued, “Xiaoshu, I heard that you’re Rich Now! You’ve even opened a restaurant and become the Lady Boss, right?”

“No,”ye Shu denied flatly.

She knew her parents’character. If they knew that she had opened a restaurant and that the business was doing well, there would probably be trouble.

Lin Xiaowei continued, “Don’t lie to us! Big SIS has already told us everything! Xiaoshu, you are the daughter of the Ye family. No matter what, you will always be a member of the Ye family! Your things are the things of the Ye family! Your Money is also the money of the Ye family!”

At this point, Lin Xiaowei paused and continued:

“You are a woman with a child. How can you have the energy to manage a restaurant? So, I discussed with your brother. We will take your restaurant. Although it is tiring, we are family! “We’ll go to the station later and complete the transfer procedures! “Oh right, I heard that searing flames is doing well now. He’s become a big streamer and has saved a lot of money. It’s really not safe for you and your daughter to have so much money in your hands. So, you’d better hand over all the money to us for safekeeping! “I heard from big sister that you have fifty million now, right?”

Ye Zao originally thought that this family was here to pick up the slack.
