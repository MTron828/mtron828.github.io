“Chapter 1062: 234: the black-bellied Scorch, who’s going to set who up? 5”

Translator: 549690339

“An Lizi caught up with ye Zao’s footsteps. “Scorch, where are you going? Aren’t we going to visit Pingting?” ”

Ye Zao’s tone was shallow. “Let’s go buy a bunch of flowers and bring them with us.”

“”Okay.”An Lizi nodded. “Look at this blockhead of mine, I didn’t even think of that.” ”

There were many flower shops near the hospital.

Ye Zhuo bought a bunch of white stars while an Lizi picked a bunch of calamus.

“After choosing the flowers, the two of them went to the entrance of the hospital again. An Lizi was surprised to find that the reporters who were guarding the entrance of the hospital just now had all disappeared. It was as if what she saw just now was an illusion. ”

“An lizi asked incredulously, “Where are they? Where did they go?” ”

Ye Zao’s expression was indifferent. “Maybe something even more explosive happened!”

“An Lizi scratched her head. “They left too quickly! Oh right, which floor did pingting live on?” ”

“”B building, third floor,”ye Zao said. ”

“The two of them brought Zhao Pingting to B building, third floor of the inpatient department. ”

“The door of the ward was half-closed. From the crack of the door, one could see Zhao Pingting sitting on the bed with her hands hugging her knees. Her eyes were lifeless. It was obvious that she was immersed in her own world. ”

“Seeing Zhao pingting like this, an Lizi could not help but feel a lump in her throat. ”

Ye Zao knocked on the door.

It was not until a few seconds later that Zhao Pingting finally reacted. She turned to look at the door. “Come in.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“An Lizi took a deep breath and held back her tears. Then, she smiled and pushed the door open. As usual, she said, “Pingting, we’re here to see you!” ”

“”Zao Zao, Lizi!” ”

“Seeing ye Zhuo and an Lizi, Zhao Pingting’s eyes, which were originally dim, were now full of light. ”

Ye Zhuo placed the sky full of stars in the vase on the cabinet and then opened the window to ventilate.

An Lizi handed the Gladiolus in her hand to Zhao Pingting. “Do You Smell Good?”

Zhao Pingting took a sniff and nodded with a smile. “Yes.”

“An lizi continued, “By the way, what did the Doctor Say? Are You Okay?” ”

“”I’m fine, don’t worry.” ”

Ye Zhuo looked back slightly. “Shall we start blackmailing him?”

“”Sure!”Zhao pingting nodded with a smile. At this moment, the three of them seemed to have returned to the past. ”

The past where nothing had happened!

“In a short while, the three of them had entered a heated game. ”

“”Pingting, hit him! Hit that short leg!” ”

“F * ck! is that Milady Crazy?”

“The other side seems to know how to play this game! F * ck! I’m Dead Again!”

“I’m Dead Too!”

“Ye Zao was controlling his phone with one hand, and he took a sip of water with the other. “Don’t panic, Daddy will avenge you.” ”

“”Go, go, Go! Kill that Li Bai on the other side! He actually turned my blue just now!” ”

Ye Zao controlled the new hero Origin song and arrived at the opposite wild zone alone.

Li Bai was farming the wild zone.

Ye Zao directly used a skill to cut across. Li Bai did not have the time to use his ultimate skill before he was terminated just like that!

“Then, ye Zao came to the middle of the road and Yue ta killed the opponent’s Angela. ”

He killed both of them in a minute!

“”F * CK, Zao Zao, you’re Amazing!” ”

“The opponent must be furious!”

The three of them played a total of ten rounds of the ranking competition. An Lizi and Zhao Pingting followed behind ye Zhuoyou and won all the way.

“In the blink of an eye, it was evening. ”

Ye Zhuoyou looked at Zhao Pingting and an Lizi. “What do the two of you want to eat? I’ll go downstairs and buy some.”

“An Lizi said bluntly, “I want to eat the food from Yueyang restaurant.” ”

“Ye zhuoyou nodded and continued, “What About You, Pingting?” ”

“Zhao pingting said, “I’ll do the same as Lizi.” ”

“”Okay, I’ll go buy the food then. You two wait for me to come back.” ”

“”Go on, Go On!”An Lizi waved her hand. ”

Ye Zhuo turned around and walked out of the door.

“At this moment, an Lizi seemed to have suddenly remembered something. “Zhuozhuo, wait a moment!” ”

“What’s Wrong?”Ye Zhuo looked back slightly.

“An lizi continued, “I still want to eat the fan pot next to Yueyang restaurant. Can you wrap a portion for me while you’re at it?” ”

“I’ll give it to you if you call me Daddy.”Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly.

“An Lizi hesitated for a moment, but in the end, she lost to the delicacies. “Daddy!” ”

“Wait.”

“Zhao pingting, who was at the side, laughed softly. “Zao Zao is really getting worse and worse!” ”

An Lizi nodded in agreement. “Who said so! He actually wants to be my daddy!”

“About an hour later, ye Zao walked in with the takeaway. ”

“”Zao Zao, you’re finally back. Ping Ting and I are starving to death!” ”

Ye Zao placed the meal on the table. “I was delayed for a while when I packed the vermicelli pot. The business there was so good that I waited in line for 20 minutes.”
