Cen Yuyan nodded. “He’s very good. It’s just that...”

Cen Yuyan hesitated for a moment.

“What’s Wrong?”Song Chenyu continued to ask.

“CEN Yuyan continued, “It’s just that he’s a little young. He’s only 21, and I’m already 39.”Cen Yuyan originally just wanted to play with Zhou Rui. After all, there was an 18-year age difference between the two of them. ”

“But after getting along with him, Cen Yuyan realized that she had really fallen in love with Zhou Rui. ”

“Although Zhou Rui was young, his mind was especially mature. ”

“Most importantly, she and Zhou Rui had a lot in common when they were together. ”

Zhou Rui liked everything that she liked.

She also liked the things that Zhou Rui liked very much.

“Song Chenyu held Cen Yuyan’s hand. “Yuyan, true love can transcend age. Haven’t you heard of a saying? Height is not a distance, age is not a problem.” ”

“Cen Yuyan looked at song Chenyu in surprise. “Chenyu, do you really think so?” ”

She had thought that song Chenyu would not think highly of them.

She did not expect song Chenyu to support her so much.

This made Cen Yuyan very touched.

“Song Chenyu nodded, “Yuyan, I really hope that you can be happy, because I can see from your eyes that that boy is definitely someone worth committing to for life! “Your age is right here. Since happiness has come, you should grasp it well and not let it slip away. Once something slips away, it will never come back.” ”

“Cen Yuyan looked at song Chenyu like this, her eyes filled with a sudden realization. ”

She had to say.

Song Chenyu’s words had finally hit the bottom of her heart.

She was already thirty-nine.

It was not easy to meet a boy who was suitable for her.

She should grasp hold of him.

She could not miss out on Zhou Rui. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“If she missed out on Zhou Rui, where would she find another man like Zhou Rui? ”

So...

Song Chenyu was right.

“Song Chenyu was simply a bright light in her life, able to illuminate the direction she was heading in in the dark night. ”

“Cen Yuyan hugged song Chenyu. “Chenyu, thank you. I think I should know what to do.” ”

“Song Chenyu also reached out to hug Cen Yuyan. “Yuyan, you’re my last good friend. No one wants you to be happy more than me. Aren’t you being too polite by saying thank you to me?” ”

Cen Yuyan was extremely glad that she had met song Chenyu.

“If it wasn’t for Song Chenyu, her life would definitely be in a mess. ”

“”Chenyu, in my heart, you’ve long been my family.”CEN Yuyan continued, “Although Shaoqing is now with Ye Zhuo, I believe that one day, our family will definitely see Ye Zhuo’s true colors.” ”

“The smile on song Chenyu’s face did not diminish. “Yuyan, it’s because you have too deep a prejudice against Miss Ye. I feel that Miss Ye is a particularly good person. Since fifth master likes her, then we should bless them.” ”

“Cen Yuyan’s eyes were filled with disdain. “Good? If she was good, she wouldn’t have seduced Lu Xiu! She clearly knows that I liked Lu Xiu previously!” ”

“”Alright, Alright.”Song Chenyu patted Cen Yuyan’s shoulder. “The matter with Lu Xiu has already passed. Don’t you have your boy now? Oh right, tell me about him now. How did you two meet?” ”

“Song Chenyu was born as an actress. When she said this, her expression was very natural. Even a professional would not be able to tell that she was acting. ”

“When she heard this, Cen Yuyan’s face revealed a bashful expression, “His name is Zhou Rui. I met him at a cocktail party. He’s very nice and considerate. Oh right, me and him, I was the one who pursued him first. “Sunfish, do you think he’ll change his mind if I spend more time with him in the future?” ”

Cen Yuyan was quite worried about this problem.

“After all, she was the one who first fell in love with Zhou Rui. ”

Cen Yuyan was someone who would confess her feelings if she liked him.

She would not hide her feelings in her heart.

Zhou Rui was a very different boy to her.

“At the cocktail party, Zhou Rui rejected all the little girls who came forward to strike up a conversation. ”

“After the cocktail party ended, Cen Yuyan thought that Zhou Rui had lent her the umbrella to ask for her contact information. She did not expect Zhou Rui to not have such thoughts at all. ”

It was only until she met Zhou Rui again by chance.

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “Don’t worry, it won’t happen. In love, it doesn’t matter who confesses first. Although it looks like you were the one who confessed first, Zhou Rui might have long been tempted. He’s young, so he might have other concerns, which is why he hasn’t confessed to you yet. So you don’t have to worry about this problem at all.” ”

“Hearing song Chenyu’s words, Cen Yuyan felt much more at ease. ”

“Song Chenyu continued, “Isn’t Zhou Rui still waiting for you downstairs? Quickly go down, don’t waste time here.” ”

“Then I’ll go down first.”

“En.”Song Chenyu nodded. “I won’t send you off. Let’s find an opportunity and you can bring me to formally meet Zhou Rui.”

“”Okay.”Cen Yuyan smiled and said, “Then when you have time, I’ll arrange for you to meet.” ”

Song Chenyu watched Cen Yuyan walk out.

“Until Cen Yuyan’s figure disappeared, the smile on song Chenyu’s face disappeared completely, and a faint light flashed in his eyes. ”

Downstairs.

“Seeing Cen Yuyan go downstairs, Zhou Rui immediately walked out of the car. “Yuyan, you finally came down. If you still don’t come down, I’ll go to the apartment and ask door to door.” ”

“Cen Yuyan smiled and said, “It’s only been half an hour. Is it that exaggerated?” ”

“It’s only been half an hour?”Zhou Rui was stunned and looked at his watch. “Why do I feel like it’s been a few hours?”

“As he finished speaking, Zhou Rui hugged Cen Yuyan. “What should I do, Yuyan? I Can’t leave you for even a minute now.” ”

“Cen Yuyan smiled and said, “Who knows if you’re a glib talker?” ”

“Zhou Rui had many girlfriends before, so dealing with an old woman like Cen Yuyan was a piece of cake for him. “I have a sincere heart for you, and the Sun and moon can tell! If you don’t believe me, you can dig out my heart and have a look.” ”

“Cen Yuyan was already thirty-nine years old this year, and in many aspects, she could not be compared to a young girl. ”

“But fortunately, Cen Yuyan’s face could still be seen. In addition, CEN Yuyan had money and power. For money, Zhou Rui could still tolerate it. Otherwise, Zhou Rui would not be bothered to deal with an old woman like Cen Yuyan! ”

“Cen Yuyan liked Zhou Rui very much, so she naturally believed his words without a doubt. ”

“She was good-looking, had a good figure, a good personality, and also had a temperament. It was normal for Zhou Rui to be attracted to her. ”

“Zhou Rui continued, “Why don’t you come to My Place Tonight?” ”

Cen Yuyan hesitated for a moment.

“She had been together with Zhou Rui for nearly half a month, but she had not had any substantial relationship with Zhou Rui. ”

“Don’t hesitate.”Zhou Rui pushed Cen Yuyan into the car. “I’m not going to eat you.”

“Hearing this, Cen Yuyan’s face turned hot, and she half-pushed and half-sat in the car. ”

“Zhou Rui lived nearby, and soon, the car reached its destination. ”

“Contrary to Cen Yuyan’s expectations, Zhou Rui did not seem to have any other thoughts. He just wanted to personally cook her a candlelit dinner. ”

Cen Yuyan had dated many people before.

But this was the first time a man had personally cooked for her.

Cen Yuyan was very touched as she watched Zhou Rui’s busy back in the kitchen.

“Not long after, two steaks were placed in front of Cen Yuyan, “Yuyan, I wasn’t born well. Everything I have today was earned by myself. Don’t laugh if I say it out loud. I’ve never seen a steak before I was 16 years old. This is also my first time frying a steak. Quick, try and see how it tastes.” ”

“Cen Yuyan elegantly cut off a piece of steak. “It’s fresh, tender, and juicy. You’ve mastered the heat just right. I like it very much.” ”

“As she finished speaking, Cen Yuyan raised her head to look at Zhou Rui. “Zhou Rui, in my eyes, you’re a very outstanding person. Don’t belittle yourself so much. I Don’t care what your past is like. What I love is the current you.” ”

Cen Yuyan was not the kind of person who paid attention to family status. She did not care about Zhou Rui’s birth at all.

“A person could not decide his own birth, but he could decide his own fate. ”

Take Zhou Rui for example.

“Although Zhou Rui was not born well, he was very talented and had a business mind. He was only twenty-one years old now, but he had already made some achievements at a young age. Who knew how many streets he was ahead of his peers. ”

“Therefore, Cen Yuyan admired Zhou Rui very much. ”

Very much.

“She had dated many boyfriends, but none of them had made her love them to the bone like Zhou Rui. ”

Zhou Rui had let her know what it meant to be crazy if she did not see him for a day!

“When she heard this, Zhou Rui lowered her head. There was an indescribable expression on her face. “Yuyan, I’m afraid that I’m not good enough for you. You’re the fourth daughter of the Cen family... and Me, my parents are all ordinary workers.” ”
