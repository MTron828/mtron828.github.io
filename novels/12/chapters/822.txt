“”Mom, you should be thanking yourself.”After thinking for a while, Lin Jincheng continued, “I hope that when fourth brother comes back, you will be the same as you are now. Don’t make things difficult for them.” ”

Lin Jincheng was most afraid that old Mrs. Lin would go back on her words.

“Old Mrs. Lin took a deep breath. “Jincheng, don’t worry. Mom has really thought it through.”After so many things had happened, if she was still as stubborn as before, then there was really no cure. ”

Lin Jin Cheng nodded.

“Just then, an Lizi walked out of the house. ”

Old Lady Lin Smiled at an Lizi. “It’s Sunday today. Why isn’t Lizi out to play?”

An Lizi was stunned.

“Old Lady Lin’s behavior had been too abnormal recently. First, she said that she was too thin and had people bring her a lot of nutrition products. Then, they gave her a shopping card. Now, she took the initiative to greet her. ” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“”What, what can I do for You?” ”

An Lizi really didn’t have a good impression of old Mrs. Lin.

“Previously, in order to stop Lin Qingxuan and Xia Xiaoman from being together, old Mrs. Lin had called her a burden and a little slut in front of her... ... she was so scared that every time she went out, she would take a detour. She was afraid that she would accidentally bump into old Mrs. Lin. ”

“Old Mrs. Lin suddenly treated her so well, which made an Lizi feel a lingering fear. She always felt that old Mrs. Lin was holding back some big trick. ”

An Lizi was not the kind of person who could be coaxed by a slap and a date.

“Old Lady Lin smiled and said, “Look at how beautiful the child is! I was blind back then. Lizi, I hope you don’t blame Grandma...” ”

An Lizi smiled.

“Old Lady Lin continued, “Oh right, Lizi, have you finished the nutritional supplements that Grandma asked for? If you have, I’ll get someone to prepare some more for you.” ”

“”No need, there are still many more.” ”

“OH.”Old Lady Lin nodded.

“Seeing that an Lizi still seemed to be against her, old lady lin continued, “Jin Cheng, I’ll be going back first. If Qingxuan and the others come back, remember to let me know.” ”

“Okay.”Lin Jin Cheng nodded.

Sister-in-law Wang pushed Old Lady Lin out.

“After Old Lady Lin left, an Lizi initially thought that Lin Jincheng would at least say a few words to her. After all, she did not treat Old Lady Lin very well just now. ”

“However, Lin Jincheng did not say a single word. Instead, he smiled at an lizi and said, “Scorching went out early in the morning. Lizi, didn’t you go out to play today?” ”

“An lizi smiled and said, “I ran outside for a whole day yesterday. Today, I want to rest at home.” ”

Lin Jincheng nodded.

Liu family.

Liu Caiyi had been preparing for her promotion to president recently.

“Seeing that the date of her election for president was getting closer, Liu Caiyi became more and more nervous. ”

“In order to be more secure in her election for president, Liu Caiyi specially invited the current president of the Chinese Arts Association, Zheng Beiyang, to a teahouse for tea. ”

“The people in the Chinese arts world were all very elegant. They did not like a cup of coffee that easily exceeded a hundred cups. Instead, they preferred a cup of green tea. ”

“In order to show her sincerity, Liu Caiyi specially came to the teahouse half an hour earlier. ”

“After she sat down, a waiter immediately came over. “Hello, this is the tea list. Please take a look.” ”

Liu Caiyi took the tea list. “I’ll take this great red robe from Wuyi Mountain.”

“After saying that, Liu Caiyi added, “Oh right, there’s no need for you to brew the tea leaves. Just bring the tea sets and tea leaves over. I’ll brew it myself.” ”

“Okay.”

“Soon, the waiter came over with a set of celadon tea sets. ”

Liu Caiyi began to burn incense and brew the tea.

“Half an hour later, Zheng Beiyang arrived as promised. ”

“Caiyi.”

“Uncle Zheng.”Liu Caiyi stood up from her chair.

“Zheng beiyang smiled and said, “There was a bit of traffic on the road. Caiyi, what brought you here?” ”

“”I just arrived too.”Liu Caiyi poured a cup of tea for Zheng Beiyang. “Uncle Zheng, have some tea.” ”

“Thank you.”

“Liu Caiyi said, “Uncle Zheng, you’re too polite.” ”

“After saying that, Liu Caiyi picked up a cup of tea to toast Zheng Beiyang. “Congratulations, uncle Zheng, you’re about to be promoted. I’m here to replace wine with tea. Here’s a toast to uncle Zheng.” ”

“Zheng Beiyang picked up his cup and smiled. “Not only am I promoted, Caiyi, your future is also limitless.” ”

“Liu Caiyi was only 28 years old this year, but she had already taken the position of vice-president. Furthermore, the higher-ups even wanted to promote her to the position of president. ”

“Thinking back, when he was 28 years old, he was still a nobody in the Chinese painting world. ”

“Hearing this, Liu Caiyi narrowed her eyes and had an answer in her heart. ”

It seemed that.

Her promotion to president was already a certainty.
