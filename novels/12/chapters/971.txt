“Chapter 972: 221: a dragon has a reverse scale. If you touch it, you will definitely get angry! 1”

Song Shiyu said it bluntly without any hesitation.

“The shop owner smiled and said, “Alright. Since you have already considered it, I will prepare the medicine for you.” ”

“Okay.”Song Shiyu nodded slightly.

The shop owner went to prepare the tattoo medicine.

The tattoo needed to be applied with a local anesthetic.

Song Shiyu looked at the anesthetic the shop owner brought over and frowned slightly. “There’s no need for anesthetic.”

“No anesthetic?”The shop owner was stunned.

“Although the tattoo did not have a knife or a wound, the tattoo had to be pricked into the skin with a needle dipped in medicine. It would hurt terribly if it was pricked, not to mention that the tattoo had to be pricked into a pattern. ”

“Song Shiyu said, “Using anesthetic will affect the effect. I need the handwriting to be 100% the same.” ”

“The shop owner did not expect song Shiyu to be an expert. He smiled and said, “Then can you bear it without anesthetic?” ”

“”No problem.”Song Shiyu said calmly, not taking this matter seriously at all. ”

“The shop owner nodded. “If you can’t bear it halfway, please let me know.”In fact, the shop owner had met many people before. In order not to affect the beauty of the patterns, he chose not to use anesthetics, but none of them could endure it. ”

Because it was really too painful.

“Okay.”Song Shiyu uttered a syllable from the depths of his throat.

“Realizing that the customer didn’t talk much, the owner didn’t say anything more. After mixing the medicine, he brought the tattoo machine over and said, “Sir, please sit here.” ”

Song Shiyu walked over and sat down.

“The owner was a little worried and said, “I’m going to start. If you feel pain, you must tell me.”The owner had two tattoos on his body. He knew the experience of tattoos. ”

“Back then, he had tried to be a hero and insisted on not applying anesthetics in front of his girlfriend, but in the end, he lost to reality. ”

“Although the man in front of him had made a solemn vow, there were some things that he could not control. ”

“For example, pain. ”

The pain brought by tattoos was a heart-wrenching pain.

“Okay.”

The shop owner had thought that song Shiyu would definitely not be able to hold on halfway through his tattoos. He did not expect song Shiyu to not make a sound from the beginning to the end. He just sat there without any expression on his face. He did not even frown.

“The light from the tattoo shop coated his body with a layer of clear light, like bamboo under the white snow. ”

“The shop owner had opened a tattoo shop for three years. He had seen all kinds of people, but this was the first time he had seen a customer with such strong willpower. ”

Did he not feel pain?

“An hour later, the shop owner put down the tool in his hand and said with a smile, “Sir, it’s ready.” ”

“How much is it?”Song Shiyu asked.

“”350 yuan,”the shop owner answered. ”

Song Shiyu took out his wallet and counted 400 yuan before handing it to the shop owner. “Keep the change.”

“”Thank you,”the shop owner continued, “Remember to tear off the gauze seven hours later and rinse it clean with warm water. Before the wound heals, you can’t drink alcohol or eat spicy food.” ”

“Song Shiyu nodded slightly, then turned around and left. ”

“Looking at song Shiyu’s back, the shop owner’s eyes were full of admiration. ”

This person was really amazing.

“Seeing song Shiyu return with an ‘injury’, Bai Jiayu was shocked. “Brother song, what happened to your arm?” ”

Song Shiyu’s tone was indifferent. “I accidentally touched it.” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Is it serious?”

“It’s just a small injury.”

“Bai Jiayu was a little worried. Song Shiyu usually wouldn’t take the initiative to see a doctor even if there was something wrong with his body. He then said, “Why don’t I take you to the hospital to have a look?” ”

“”I’ve already been to the hospital,”song Shiyu said. ”

“Really?”Bai Jiayu was stunned.

“Yes.”

“Hearing this, Bai Jiayu heaved a sigh of relief and continued, “ZY sent over a new contract. Take a look.” ”

“Song Shi Group had cooperated with ZY technology company a year ago. Previously, song Shiyu had deliberately given ZY’s director a problematic contract to test whether it was worth cooperating with. He did not expect that the boss behind the scenes would see through it at a glance. ”

“Now that the contract had been renewed, ZY’s director was afraid that song Shiyu would tamper with the contract again, so he got someone to draft the contract first. ”

Song Shiyu took the contract and glanced at it. “Why are you asking questions? Sign It.”

“Bai Jiayu continued, “I heard that ZY’s behind-the-scenes boss is a woman. Who Do you think she is? What kind of woman would be able to create Zy?” ”

“ZY had always been ranked first on the dark horse list ever since it came into being. It was the leader that everyone in the fashion industry looked up to, and it was also the target that the technology industry wanted to rope in time and time again. ”
