“May I ask if you are Ms. Zhou?”

Zhou cuihua turned around. “I am.”

“The person who came immediately introduced himself respectfully. “Hello, Ms. Zhou. I am CEO Wang’s assistant, Wu ran. CEO Wang asked me to come and pick you up.” ”

“When she heard that, Zhou Cuihua’s eyes lit up. ”

Li hang was a little surprised.

She had thought that boss Wang did not value Zhou cuihua. She did not expect boss Wang to really send someone to pick her up.

It seemed that Zhou cuihua still held some position in boss Wang’s heart.

“Wu ran continued, “Originally, our boss Wang was prepared to come and pick you up personally, but he was really too busy today. Boss Wang could not leave at all, so he asked me to come over. “Boss Wang also asked me to explain to you that you don’t mind.” ”

“Zhou cuihua immediately smiled and said, “I don’t mind, I don’t mind. Even if Mr. Wang doesn’t come to pick you up, it’s okay.” ”

“Please.”The assistant immediately made a ‘please’gesture.

Zhou cuihua nodded and stepped forward.

Li hang followed closely behind.

It was a luxurious Ferrari.

“Li hang recognized it. This car was limited to 10,000 units worldwide. ”

Rich people were rich people. It was a limited edition luxury car at every turn.

The mother and daughter sat in the luxury car.

The assistant drove in front.

“An hour later, the car stopped in front of a small house in front of the lookout pavilion courtyard. ”

A fountain was being built in front of the house.

“Boss Wang was standing at the door. When he saw the Ferrari stop, he immediately went up to greet her. “Ms. Zhou.” ”

“Zhou cuihua smiled as she got out of the car. “Mr. Wang, you’re too kind. You even sent someone to pick us up. Actually, we can just drive ourselves over.” ”

“”Actually, I should have picked them up myself, but I really can’t leave today,”boss Wang said. ”

“Li hang stood behind and greeted politely, “Uncle Wang.” ”

“Boss Wang nodded. “Hang Hang, come in quickly. There are many people of the same age here today. I’ll introduce you to them later.” ”

“”Thank you, Uncle Wang,”Li Hang said. ”

“Boss Wang said, “This child, why are you still saying thank you to Uncle Wang? Come, come, let’s go in first.” ”

The mother and daughter followed boss Wang inside.

“Soon, they arrived at the banquet hall. ”

“There weren’t many people, and there weren’t as many toasts as they had imagined. ”

“Boss Wang said, “There aren’t many outsiders today. They’re all relatives. Cuihua...”boss Wang looked at Zhou Cuihua. “You don’t mind me calling you that, do you?” ”

“Zhou Cuihua was stunned at first, but then she quickly shook her head. “I don’t mind, I don’t mind.” ”

“”It’s good that you don’t mind,”boss Wang said. “My name is zhengxuan. You can just call me by your name.” ”

“”Zhengxuan, Zhengxuan,”Zhou Cuihua said a little embarrassedly. ”

“Boss Wang smiled and said, “I’ll bring the two of you to meet my mother first.” ”

“Okay.”Zhou cuihua nodded. “I even specially prepared a gift for her.”

“You’re thoughtful.”

“Zhou cuihua smiled and said, “Showing filial respect to the elderly is what we juniors should do.” ”

“”Cuihua, you’re right.”Boss Wang nodded. ”

Li hang quietly sized up boss Wang and Zhou Cuihua.

It seemed that Zhou Cuihua’s confidence was not without reason.

Boss Wang had taken a liking to Zhou cuihua.

“Otherwise, boss Wang would not have taken Zhou Cuihua so seriously. ”

“Thinking of this, Li Hang narrowed his eyes. ”

“Old Lady Wang’s bedroom was upstairs, and they arrived soon. ”

“The old lady was already 75 years old this year. Her hair was full of silver hair, and she didn’t look very energetic. ”

“Mom.”Boss Wang walked to Old Lady Wang’s side.

“Old Lady Wang looked up at him and said with a smile, “Zhengxuan is back.” ”

“Boss Wang continued, “Let me introduce you. This is cuihua. This is Cuihua’s daughter, Hang Hang. The two of them have specially come to congratulate you on your birthday.” ”

“OH.”Old Madam Wang nodded.

“Zhou cuihua immediately smiled and went forward. “Old Madam, I’m Zhou Cuihua. I wish you a long life and a longer life than Nanshan.” ”

Li hang followed. “I wish grandmother a happy birthday.”

Old Lady Wang looked at the two of them and nodded.

Zhou cuihua took out a gift that she had prepared long ago. It was a small Golden Buddha that she had spent a lot of money to buy.

She thought that even the elderly believed in this.

“Although the small Golden Buddha was gold-plated, it had cost Zhou cuihua almost half of her private money. ”

“”Old Lady, this is my birthday gift to you. Please don’t mind it.” ”

Old Lady Wang didn’t seem to hear it clearly and let out an “AH”.

Boss Wang raised his voice and repeated it in Old Lady Wang’s ear.

“After saying that, he looked at Zhou Cuihua and said with a smile, “My mother’s ears are like this. Don’t mind it.” ”

“Zhou cuihua hurriedly expressed that she didn’t mind and said, “Everyone will have such a day.” ”Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com
