“Chapter 1306: 273: directly slapping her in the face, making Zheng Wanyin doubt her life! 5”

Translator: 549690339

“At this moment, a cell phone ringtone sounded in the air. ”

“Hello.”Ye Zhuo picked up the phone.

“An.”Carl’s voice sounded on the other end of the screen.

“”Carl?”Ye Zhuo stood up and walked out, his tone a little cold. “What’s the matter?” ”

Carl?

“Hearing this, Zheng Wanyin looked up at Ye Zhuo. ”

The Carl that ye Zao was talking about was Mr. Carl?

But how did ye Zao Know Mr. Carl?

“After all, Mr. Carl was an international scientific research master! ”

Or did ye Zao deliberately say that because he heard Xie wanqiu talking about Mr. Carl when Ye Zao entered the door?

“Or, it couldn’t be such a coincidence. ”

She had just answered the call from the ABA deputy executive officer when Ye Zao received a call from Mr. Carl.

Moreover...

“Mr. Carl was from C Nation, and Ye Zao spoke Chinese. ”

The language was different. Could Mr. Carl Understand What Ye Zao was saying?

It seemed that ye Zao also heard vanity.

“Otherwise, ye Zao wouldn’t have deliberately pretended to answer the phone and talked about Mr. Carl. ”

From another perspective...

Ye Zao must have also regarded her as an enemy.

“Otherwise, ye Zao wouldn’t have competed with her and pretended to know Mr. Carl. ”

Zheng Wanyin sighed softly.

It seemed that everyone was not as simple as they looked.

Ye Zao seemed to be such a beautiful person.

But his inner thoughts were still so deep. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

There was a popular saying on the internet.

Acting Cool for a moment.

Didn’t she think about the embarrassment after being exposed by others?

A fake was a fake after all.

“Perhaps, ye Zao didn’t think about the future at all. ”

A moment later.

Ye Zao returned from outside.

“Zhou Xiang stood up and said, “It’s time to eat. Shall we go to the restaurant for dinner?” ”

Why did they have to wait for ye Zao to come back for dinner?

Xie wanqiu snorted coldly in her heart.

“If ye Zao had not come back just now, would they let her, an elder, wait forever? ”

“Although she thought so in her heart, Xie Wanqiu did not show it. She smiled at ye Zao and continued, “Zao Zao, I heard that you were on the phone with Mr. Carl Just Now?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Seeing ye Zao actually nod and admit it, Xie Wanqiu was a little surprised. ”

This little girl was too bold!

She was lying through her teeth.

“Mr. Carl was a foreigner, how could he speak Chinese! ”

She really thought that everyone else was a fool.

Was she the only smart person in the world?

Ridiculous.

“Xie wanqiu continued, “What a coincidence! Yinyin and Mr. Carl are old acquaintances. Mr. Carl will be coming to Beijing Tomorrow, and he even asked Yinyin to pick him up from the airport. Since you and Mr. Carl know each other, why don’t you let Yinyin bring Mr. Carl Home?” ”

Ye Zao’s expression was indifferent. He could hear the hidden meaning in Xie Wanqiu’s words.

Was Xie Wanqiu showing off?

But what about picking him up from the airport? Was It Worth showing off?

“Zheng wanyin quickly added, “Grandma, actually, I’ve only met Mr. Carl a few times. The Deputy Executive Officer asked me to pick him up. Otherwise, it would be very difficult for me to even meet a big shot like Mr. Carl.”She couldn’t even meet him once, not to mention ye Zao. ”

“After saying that, Zheng wanyin added, “Besides, Mr. Carl isn’t here to have fun. He has a very important mission.” ”

“”He has a mission!”Xie wanqiu said regretfully, “That’s such a pity! I thought that since all of you know each other, it would be best if you could invite Mr. Carl to our house as a guest.” ”

“”That’s not difficult,”zheng wanyin continued, “After Mr. Carl finishes his work here, he can come to our house as a guest.” ”

“”Okay, that’s settled then. When Mr. Carl is free, he must be invited to our house.” ”

“At that time, they would see how ye Zao would behave himself. ”

“Okay.”Zheng Wanyin nodded.

“Zhou Xiang stood up and said, “It’s almost time to eat. Let’s go eat first.” ”

“Let’s go eat first. I’m hungry.”Cen Yueya stood up and held ye Zao’s hand. “I wonder what delicious food was cooked in the kitchen today.”

“”Your aunt sent over smelly mandarin fish. There’s smelly mandarin fish to eat today,”Zhou Xiang said. ”

“”Really?”Cen Yueya smiled and said, “I’m most proud of this one! Do You Like It?” ”

“Ye Zao said, “I think so. I haven’t eaten the smelly mandarin fish before.”As long as it was delicious, ye Zao would like to eat it. ”

“Snail powder, smelly tofu, smelly durian, and ye Zao would not reject any of them. ”

“Although he had never eaten the smelly mandarin fish before, the name sounded pretty good. The taste should be pretty good. ”

“Let’s go and try it.”

Cen Shaoqing followed behind and calmly twirled the Buddha beads.

“As soon as he entered the restaurant, he smelled a stinky smell. ”
