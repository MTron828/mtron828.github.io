“”Mom, you and dad should go out with us.”Zhang Hong smiled and said, “It’s been so many years, but our family has never gone on a trip together!” ”

“Wang Dajun’s mood was originally quite heavy, but after returning home and hearing Zhang Hong’s words, he relaxed a lot. ”

He suddenly felt that losing his job wasn’t such a terrible thing.

It was a blessing in disguise.

He could use this opportunity to get along with his family.

“Wang Dajun continued, “Zhang Hong is right. Mom, you and dad should come with us! It’s not easy for us to decide to go on a trip. It’s a rare opportunity.” ”

“Hearing that, mother Wang was also a little shaken. She continued, “Then when your dad comes back, I’ll discuss it with him.” ”

“Okay.”Wang Dajun nodded.

“In front of his father, it was always his mother who made the decisions. As long as the queen mother nodded, his father’s side would not have any big problems. ”

It was better to choose the right day.

“Thus, on the second day of the students’vacation, the family boarded a plane to travel overseas. ”

Very soon.

A month had passed.

“During this month, Weiwei had recovered very well and was able to walk freely on the ground. ”

Ye Zhuo came over for a routine check-up.

“Weiwei smiled and said, “Sister Ye, when can I be discharged?” ”

“”Soon,”ye Zhuo replied. ”

“The smile on Weiwei’s face became even wider. “We’ll be able to see Wangfu and Wangcai soon!”At this point, the smile on Weiwei’s face dimmed for a moment before she continued, “Sister Ye, can you do me a favor?” ”

“Go ahead.”

“Weiwei continued, “Please don’t Tell Liu Meilian and Xiang Chao the truth.” ”

Ye Zao smiled and nodded slightly.

“Weiwei looked at ye Zao and said in surprise, “Sister Ye, don’t you find it strange at all?” ”

“How is it Strange?”Ye Zao asked.

“Weiwei continued, “I’ve suddenly changed so much to them!” ”

“These days, Vivi had been acting with Liu Meilian and Xiang Chao. ”

“In their eyes, Vivi was still the same Vivi who didn’t know anything. ”Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Ye Zao said, “From the moment you were pushed out of the operating room, I knew that you had seen through their true purpose.” ”

“The eyes were the window of the soul, which could be discovered by careful observation. ”

“”Sister Ye, you’re really amazing!”Vivi looked at Ye Zao, her eyes full of admiration. “I’ve decided that the female protagonist of my next comic will be based on you!” ”

She wanted to draw an all-rounded female protagonist who was both A and a!

“”Thank you,”ye Zao said. ”

“Vivi continued, “Sister Ye, do you have a boyfriend?” ”

“”No.”Ye Zao continued, “However, I do have a fiancé.” ”

“”Fiancé?”Vivi asked, “Is he very handsome?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

Weiwei fell into a fantasy. It must be a very outstanding big brother to be ye Zao’s fiancé!

“Not long after, Liu Meilian came in and asked with concern, “Miss Ye, when will our Weiwei be discharged from the hospital?” ”

“Ye Zao said, “We still need to observe. We’ll wait for the specific time to be informed.” ”

“”OH.”Liu Meilian nodded and then asked, “How is Weiwei’s recovery now?” ”

“”Average,”ye Zao replied. ”

“Hearing this answer, Liu Meilian was a little disappointed. She could not wait to bring Weiwei back immediately. ”

“After staying in the hospital for so many days, not only did she not get a single cent, but she even added a lot of money into it. This had already made her current husband very dissatisfied. The most urgent thing now was to bring Weiwei back immediately and manage Weiwei’s finances! ”

“Liu Meilian continued, “Miss Ye, is there any special medicine that can help Wei Wei recover faster? You Don’t have to worry about money at all. Our Wei Wei doesn’t lack money!” ”
