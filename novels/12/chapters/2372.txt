“The traffic in the capital was always stuck in a traffic jam. Bai Mo lay limply in her seat, her stomach churning and her head spinning. However, she could not spit it out. It was as if she was suffocating. ”

“How much longer until we arrive?”Bai Mo asked.

“If it were not for the General Alliance’s rule that the s galaxy civilization was not allowed to bring Earth, she would have brought the aircraft with her. ”

“Liu Chao looked at the navigation system. “There’s still 20 kilometers left. If there’s no traffic jam, it’ll only take half an hour.” ”

“What about the traffic jam?”Bai Mo asked.

“Liu Chao shook his head. “If there’s a traffic jam, I’m not sure either.” ”

The traffic conditions in the capital were too complicated. It was almost the same every day.

“Hearing this, Bai Mo frowned. She couldn’t take it anymore, not to mention the traffic jam! ”

“Liu Chao comforted her, “Miss Bai, don’t worry. I’ll try my best to speed up without the traffic jam.” ”

Bai Mo didn’t say anything.

Her head was too dizzy and she didn’t have the energy to answer. She never dreamed that she would one day be subjected to such torture.

Bai Mo didn’t say anything and Liu Chao didn’t say anything either. He held the steering wheel with both hands and looked ahead silently.

“After an unknown amount of time, Liu Chao Woke Bai Mo up from her dizziness. “Miss Bai, Miss Bai!” ”

Bai Mo opened her eyes.

“”Miss Bai, we’re here,”Liu Chao continued. ”

“Hearing this, Bai Mo’s eyes immediately lit up and she immediately sat up. ”

Liu Chao held Bai Mo’s arm. “Let me help you down.”

“Bai Mo actually despised Liu Chao’s touch. After all, Liu Chao was only a criminal in the s galaxy. But now, she couldn’t muster up any strength, so she could only let Liu Chao help her up. ”

“Liu Chao helped Bai Mo out of the car and breathed in the fresh air. Bai Mo’s expression was better, but her face was still as pale as before. ”

“Urgh!”

“Finally, Bai Mo could not hold it in any longer and directly vomited. ”

“Because she usually only drank nutrient fluids and had no other food in her stomach, all Bai mo vomited was sour water. ”

“It was bitter, astringent, and very disgusting. ”

“Liu Chao held Bai Mo’s arm with one hand and patted her back with the other. He resisted the nausea and asked, “Miss Bai, are you alright?” ”

It turned out that beautiful women were also so disgusting when they vomited.

“Bai Mo vomited so badly that she wanted to throw up her stomach as well. She quickly looked up at Liu Chao and said, “Help me in to rest first.” ”

“Okay.”

Liu Chao nodded and helped Bai Mo into the house.

“Liu Chao had been on Earth for three years. He was an ordinary person in the s galaxy, so he could only be an ordinary person on Earth. For three years, he had been living on a black car, and the house he was living in now was rented. ”

“It could already be considered good now. When he first came to Earth, Liu Chao once went to beg for a living. ”

Not everyone was ye Zhuo.

“No matter where he was, he could do well and dominate a region. ”

“The rented house was not big. It had two rooms and one living room. Because he knew that Bai Mo was coming, Liu Chao prepared a room for her. “Miss Bai, this will be your room from now on.” ”

“Bai Mo lay on the bed and said in a daze, “You go out first. I need to rest.” ”

“This was her first time feeling carsick. It was not a good feeling. Although she had already gotten out of the car, she still felt like she was still sitting in the car. She just wanted to close her eyes and have a good sleep. ”

“Liu Chao continued, “Miss Bai, shall I get you a glass of water?” ”

“”Yes,”Bai Mo replied. ”

Liu Chao turned around and went out to get some water.

“Very soon, he came in with some water. “Miss Bai, have some water. Drinking some water will make you feel better.” ”

“Bai Mo had just spat out some water and her mouth was dry. When she heard Liu Chao’s words, she immediately took the cup and took a sip. As soon as she took a sip, she immediately spat it out, she roared angrily, “What is this? Do you want to poison me to death?”Such disgusting water.., was it even worth letting her drink it! ”

This was no different from insulting her.

“Liu Chao could not dodge in time. Bai Mo spat out all the water onto his body. Coupled with the fact that it was summer, the thin layer of clothing stuck to his skin. It was really uncomfortable! ”

But Liu Chao could only endure it.

“Because Bai Mo owed him a favor. If Bai Mo had not helped him back then, he would have died long ago. ”

“Although Earth was a low-grade planet, Liu Chao had already completely adapted to life on Earth. ”

“Right now, he only wanted to buy a house, marry a wife, have a child, and live a warm life with a wife and child. ”

“Liu Chao continued, “Miss Bai, this is the best pure water.” ”
