“In order to cater to Bai Mo, Liu Chao specially bought the best water he could. ”

“Bai Mo frowned, her face full of disgust. “Get lost!” ”

Liu Chao could only turn around and leave.

“Actually, it wasn’t that there was something wrong with the water on Earth. ”

It was just that Bai Mo had never drunk real pure water.

How could a person who had been drinking polluted water for a long time know that pure water was good?

“Although the s galaxy was a high-level civilization galaxy, the S Galaxy had been pursuing development and had long neglected the environment. Therefore, the things in the s galaxy looked very nice, but most of them were inedible. ”

“This also corresponded to a sentence: the golden catkins were rotten on the outside, but inside. ”

“Bai Mo looked at Liu Chao’s back, her eyes filled with envy and began to regret making the decision to come to Earth. ”

“It was only the first day, and she was already like this. There were still so many days ahead of her. What should she do? ”

“Lying on the bed, Bai Mo fell asleep. When she woke up again, it was already the next morning. ”

Bai Mo sat up from the bed and looked at her surroundings with a frown.

“Because she had been carsick the day before, she had not been able to take a good look at the environment of the house. Now that she looked at it again, she felt disgusted everywhere. ”

“The old walls, the old furniture, and the cheap bedding. ”

How could these things match up to such a noble person like her?

Bai Mo endured the disgust and got down from the bed. She opened the door and walked out.

She pushed the door open and entered the living room.

“The price of a house in the capital was high. Although it was two bedrooms and one living room, the total area was only seventy square meters, so it looked a little crowded. ”

“Seeing Bai Mo come out, Liu Chao immediately came over to welcome her. “Miss Bai, you’re awake. The toiletries have been prepared for you. They’re all new. You should go and wash up.” ”

“Bai Mo did not follow Liu Chao to the bathroom. Instead, she said, “I want to change places.” ”

The environment here was really too bad!

“Bai Mo said that she could stay here for a long time. Even if it was just for a day, Bai Mo would not be able to stay here. ”

“Liu Chao said awkwardly, “Miss Bai, I used to live in group rentals. It’s already my limit to let you stay here.”In the past, when Liu Chao was alone, he could live wherever he wanted, however, Bai Mo was different. Not only was she born in a high-level galaxy, she was also a rich young lady. She had never suffered since she was young. If not, Liu Chao would not have taken out his wife’s notebook. ”

Group rental housing?

“Bai Mo frowned. She had never been to Earth, nor had she experienced the life of the working people at the bottom. Naturally, she did not know the concept of group rental housing. ”

“Seeing her like this, Liu Chao immediately explained, “Group rental housing is a house that many people rent and live in together. For example, the one we are living in now can live in at least five families!” ”

It was not an exaggeration to say that there were five families.

Some second-hand landlords had even changed one room and one living room into three or four rooms in order to earn money.

“With that said, Bai Mo seemed to understand a little. She continued, “Then where does Bai Jingshu Live?” ”

“Bai Jingshu was a good-for-nothing. Needless to say, the place she lived in was definitely a group rentals. ”

“Although she already knew the result, Bai Mo wanted to hear it from Liu Chao himself. ” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Liu Chao continued, “Miss Jingshu seems to be a great writer. Ordinary people usually can’t enter the place where she lives.” ”

“Writer?”Bai Mo’s eyes widened in disbelief.

Someone like Bai Jingshu could also be a writer?

Wasn’t this a joke?

“Liu Chao nodded. “Yes, you didn’t hear wrongly. Miss Jingshu is a great writer. Moreover, she’s a very famous celebrity writer on Earth.” ”

Bai Jingshu was a writer of historical stories.

“The books she wrote were not only changed into television dramas, but were also permanently stored in the National Library. ”

Bai Mo was not happy to hear that.

What right did Bai Jingshu have?

“After a while, Bai Mo continued, “Do you know Lin Ze?” ”

“Liu Chao nodded. “A little. He’s the son of the Lin family’s head and the founder of an organization. He’s also someone I can’t get in touch with.”The circle was different, their connections were different. Liu Chao knew most of the black-cab drivers. ”

Bai Mo’s mood was very complicated at this moment.

She didn’t know what to say.

“After a while, Liu Chao continued, “You should quickly go wash up. There’s no nutrient solution on earth. You still need to eat breakfast.” ”

“Bai Mo originally wanted to refuse, but when she thought of Lin Ze, she swallowed her words. ”

She came to Earth this time to be close to Lin Ze. They were going in both directions. How could she dislike the food on earth?

“From today onwards, she would be like Lin Ze. She would eat three meals a day, four seasons a year. ”

“Bai Mo continued, “Where are the toiletries?” ”

“Here.”Liu Chao immediately took a step forward and brought Bai Mo to the bathroom.

“Although the toiletries were all new, Bai Mo had been frowning the entire time. ”

“After dinner, she used a special communicator to contact Bai Yuanyuan. ”

“Bai Yuanyuan heard about her experience and immediately said, “Mo Mo, are you stupid? You Don’t have to Suffer Like This!” ”

“Then what should I do?”Bai Mo asked.

“Bai Yuanyuan continued, “Go and look for Bai Jingshu! She’s your sister after all. Can she just sit by and do nothing? It’s best if you can move to the Lin family. That way, you’ll have more chances to get in touch with Lin Ze!” If that happened, wouldn’t Lin Ze fall in love with Bai Mo? ”

“Hearing this, Bai Mo hesitated for a moment before continuing, “What if Bai Jingshu rejects me?” ”

“”Don’t worry, she won’t.”Bai Yuanyuan knew Bai Jingshu too well. “No matter what, you’re Bai Jingshu’s sister. You’re new here and have eaten so much crying. Bai Jingshu will definitely lend you a hand.” ”

Bai Jingshu was like the Holy Mother Mary Sue.

“What if...”Bai Mo was a little nervous.

“Bai Yuanyuan smiled and said, “If she really rejects you, you’ll be begging ye Shu! I believe that Ye Shu will definitely lend you a hand!” ”
