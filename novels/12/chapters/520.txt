Old Mrs. Cen told Zhou Xiang about this matter.

Zhou Xiang was also very surprised when she heard it.

Ye Zao was the long-lost daughter of Lin Jin City?

This is too unbelievable!

...

October 6th.

Today was the day of the banquet.

The banquet was held at the largest five-star hotel in Beijing.

“The Lin family was rich and powerful. They booked the entire hotel. Other than the staff, all the guests coming to and from the hotel today were guests who had come to attend the banquet. Luxury cars parked in front of the hotel one after another. ”

These people standing out alone were intimidating existences.

Old Lady Lin and the three daughters-in-law of the Lin family were receiving guests.

“As Lin Jincheng was the youngest child in the family, the eldest daughter-in-law of the Lin family, Wu Mei, was already 53 years old. Although she was over 500 years old, she took good care of herself. Her every move carried an elegant temperament. ”

“The beauty was old, but her temperament and manners were still there. ”

“Seeing that Old Lady Lin coughed from time to time, Wu Mei said, “Mom, why don’t you go inside and rest first? I have my second and third siblings here.” ”

“The second and third daughter-in-law also said, “Sister-in-law is right. Mom, you can go inside and rest first.” ”

“Old Lady Lin should have waved her hand. “No, no! Qianhua and Xianxian haven’t arrived yet.” ”

Everyone knew that Feng Qianhua was the ideal daughter-in-law in Old Lady Lin’s heart.

Unfortunately.

Things didn’t go as planned.

“Not only did Lin Jin city have a useless biological daughter, but they also had a wife from the countryside. ”

It was really hard to explain.

“At this moment, a new guest came in. Wu Mei hurriedly went up to welcome them. “Director Ma, director Wang, please come in.” ”

“Looking at Wu Mei’s back, her second daughter-in-law, Zhang Zhenzhen, said, “I wonder if the Cen family will send someone tonight.” ”

“Her third daughter-in-law, Yang Wenyin, said, “Old Mrs. Cen has always been on good terms with our mother. She will definitely come!” ”

“Hearing Yang Wenyin’s words, a satisfied light appeared in Old Mrs. Lin’s eyes. ”

Who in the capital did not know that she was on good terms with the Cen family’s old lady?

“Zhang Zhenzhen smiled and said, “That’s true! Then do you think CEN fifth master will come?” ”

Yang Wenyin shook her head. “Then I don’t know! I heard that he’s a loner and eats vegetarian gowns all year round. He hates to attend banquets the most!”

“Zhang Zhenzhen sighed and continued, “It’s a pity that we didn’t have a daughter. If we had a daughter, with our mother’s friendship with Old Lady Cen, would that child marriage still fall on the Mu family’s Head?” ”

“In order to give birth to a daughter, Zhang Zhenzhen gave birth to four children in one go. Unfortunately, all of them were useless. ”

“Initially, Zhang Zhenzhen wanted to give birth to a fifth child. Unfortunately, there was an accident when she was pregnant with the fifth child. ”

“Yang Wenyin also gave birth to two sons, she covered her mouth and laughed, “We didn’t have the life to give birth to a daughter! Some people did have the life to give birth to a daughter, but it’s a pity that they gave birth to an idiot! I wonder what Jin City is thinking! Why would they bring such a daughter back! They even invited so many dignitaries. Tell me, aren’t they embarrassing our Lin Family?” ”

“When she said the last sentence, Yang Wenyin lowered her voice. ”

“Born in a wealthy family, who was shameless? ”

“The two of them hadn’t even returned yet, but they had already made it known to everyone in the capital. Who Wouldn’t be angry? ”

Zhang Zhenzhen sighed. “I only pray that the two of them can help us at the banquet!”It had to be said that Lin Jincheng had indeed handled this matter improperly.

“With the looks of the mother and daughter, was it worth him to do so wantonly? ”

Just bring them back secretly!

Must Everyone Know About It?

Yang Wenyin also sighed.

“At this moment, Feng Qianhua, dressed in a wine-red gown, walked over with a Thermos flask in her hand. “Aunt Lin.” ”

“Qianhua is here.”Old Madam Lin’s eyes lit up.

“Feng Qianhua nodded and greeted Zhang Zhenzhen and Yang Wenyin. “Second sister-in-law, third sister-in-law. Oh yes, where’s eldest sister-in-law?” ”

“Old Madam Lin smiled and said, “Your eldest sister-in-law is entertaining guests inside! Oh yes, where’s Xianxian?” ” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Feng Qianhua said, “She’s with the young people at the back.” ”

Old Madam Lin nodded.

“Feng Qianhua continued, “Aunt Lin, let me help you in to rest and drink the soup while you’re at it.” ”

“Okay.”

“Feng Qianhua turned to look at Zhang Zhenzhen and Yang Wenyin. “Second sister-in-law and third sister-in-law, I’ll go in with Aunt Lin first.” ”

“Go.”The two of them nodded.

“After Feng Qianhua helped old Madam Lin in.., zhang Zhenzhen sighed and said, “I don’t understand. Qianhua has a figure, a figure, a face, and a face. Look at how well her skin is maintained! Why would Jin city fall for a woman from the countryside?” ”
