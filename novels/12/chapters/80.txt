Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

This was a dress that could adjust the temperature!

It could be bought without tens of thousands of yuan?

Although tens of thousands of yuan was quite expensive, it was really worth it to buy a dress that could adjust the temperature!

Therefore, even if it was tens of thousands of yuan, Lin Sha still felt that it was worth it.

This kind of high-tech was not something that could be bought with money.

Ye Zao said, “Sister Shasha, I remember that you gave me a necklace on my birthday. Do you want me to transfer the money for this necklace to you?”

As he said that, ye Zao pulled out a four-leaf clover necklace from his neck.

The silver four-leaf clover necklace made his fair skin look even clearer like snow.

Lin Shasha did not expect ye Zao to wear the necklace that she gave him all the time. Her heart suddenly felt warm.

“The necklace that I gave you is not worth anything. How can it compare to this dress!”

Ye Zhuo held Lin Sha’s hand, “But in my heart, this necklace is priceless. It represents our friendship, just like the dress that I gave you. “Sister Sha Sha, if you treat me as a friend, don’t mention money anymore. Otherwise, I will be angry.”

Ye Zao had said so much. If he refused, it would be unreasonable.

Lin Shasha continued, “Then I will accept it. Thank you, Zao Zao.”

“You’re welcome.”Ye Zao continued, “Wonderful Music’s party is on the evening of the 18th. I plan to go to the capital a day earlier. After the party, I will also play in the capital for a few days. Sister Shasha, do you have time?”

Hearing this, Lin Shasha’s eyes lit up.

“Okay, okay. I’ve never been to the capital before.”Lin Shasha had quit her job because of the abortion and had not gone to work yet.

She had just enough time to play for a few days.

After saying this, Lin Shasha continued, “Don’t you have classes, Zhuo Zhuo?”

January 18th was not the winter holiday yet. Ye Zhuo was only in his third year of high school. Lin Shasha was afraid that it would affect her studies.

Ye Zao shook his head. “I’ve already made an agreement with our class teacher. As long as I’m back on time for the final exam, it will be fine.”

Ye Zao had already promised Jiang Wenhui that he would definitely get into the top ten of the grade for the final exam, so Jiang Wenhui had approved so many days of leave.

“That’s good.”Lin Sha nodded.

Because it was ye Zao’s first time going out, Ye Shu was worried that he did not sleep well the night before.

Ye Sen was also worried. “Zao Zao, why don’t I Go With You?”

Yun Jing was thousands of kilometers away from the capital. If he did not go with Ye Zao, Ye Sen would not be at ease.

“Yes, yes, yes. Let your uncle go with you.”Ye Shu nodded in agreement.

Ye Zao shook his head, “Uncle, are you still not at ease with my skills? The express delivery company is just on the right track now, and it is an important period of development. If you are not in charge of the overall situation of the company at this time, I wonder how much business you will lose!”

Just as ye Zhuo thought, Ye Sen was very business-minded.

In just two months, he had brought the company back from the brink of bankruptcy.

At present, Shengdong Express Company’s business was already expanding to the neighboring city.

Ye Sen said, “But no matter how important the business is, it’s not as important as you! I have to go with you!”Although ye Zhuo’s skills were not bad, she was still an 18-year-old child after all. What if she was cheated?

“Uncle, you really don’t have to worry. By the way, Sister Shasha is accompanying me.”

“Shasha is going too?”Ye Shu asked.

Ye Zao nodded slightly.

Ye Shu was relieved to hear that Lin Shasha was going too.

Lin Shasha had been working for a few years and had traveled a lot by herself. She had a lot of social experience.

With Lin Shasha accompanying ye Zao, there was no need to worry.

“So, Mom, uncle, don’t worry. I’ll be fine.”

The next morning, Ye Sen drove ye Zao and Lin Sha to the airport.

Ye Sen was worried that the two girls would be deceived outside, so he told them a lot of things.

“Remember to lock the door when you’re in the hotel. Don’t open the door for strangers. When you’re there, remember to call me.”

Ye Zao nodded. “I understand, uncle. Why are you acting like a little old man? I’ve repeated this sentence ten times!”

“People talk too much and trees have too many roots. Do you think I’m being too long-winded?”Ye Sen patted ye Zao’s head.

Ye Zao was a little stunned by the PAT.

In her previous life, she was a big boss in technology. She had never been treated like a child, nor had she been patted on the head like this...

Soon, they arrived at the airport.
