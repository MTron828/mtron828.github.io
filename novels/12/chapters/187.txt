Chapter 188: 088: The Boss is online, I’ve finally found her! 1

The pressure in the air dropped to the freezing point.

The assistant immediately broke out in cold sweat, his entire body turning cold.

He had been by song Shiyu’s side for more than three years, so he was very clear about his methods. He hurriedly added, “But I can be sure that the real daughter of the Mu family does not have a scar on her arm.”

Song Shiyu narrowed his eyes.

In other words, that little girl back then could not have been third Miss Zhao or first Miss Mei, much less Mu Yourong.

Now, the only possibility was ye Zhuo.

Thinking of his previous two encounters with Ye Zhuo, song Shiyu’s gaze darkened even more.

She was indeed different from the other daughters of the socialites in Yunjing City.

The information was encrypted.

She was a completely different person from the trash in the rumors.

She was mysterious and complicated.

“Alright, you can go back to your work.”Song Shiyu raised his hand.

The assistant looked as if she had been pardoned and walked out with her head lowered.

......

After the assistant left, song Shiyu was the only person left in the huge room.

The air was frighteningly quiet.

The song family lived on the mountainside.

Coupled with song Shiyu’s joy and quietness, the air was even colder under the cover of dusk.

Song Shiyu stood in front of the French window. There was no emotion in his eyes. In a trance, he went back to twelve years ago.

In the cold basement.

Hunger, cold, and fear surrounded him.

A little girl slowly sat down beside him.

“Brother, are you hungry? I have candy here. You Won’t be hungry if you eat one.”

Thinking of this, Song Shiyu took out a big white rabbit milk candy from his pocket and peeled off the icing. Only when the sweet taste slowly spread on the tip of his tongue did the hostility in song Shiyu’s body dissipate a little.

He turned around and walked to the backyard.

Old Madam song lived in the backyard.

The old lady was not in good health. It was not yet dark, so she lay on the bed.

“Grandma.”

“Shiyu is here.”Seeing song Shiyu, Old Madam Song’s face was tinged with a smile.

Song Shiyu picked up a pillow and placed it behind Old Madam Song. “Grandma, are you feeling better?”

Old Madam song nodded.

“Miss Ye’s medical skills are pretty good. I’ll invite her over to take a look at you,”song Shiyu continued.

“Sure, I happen to like her too.”As soon as she said that, old madam song seemed to have thought of something. “But tomorrow is Monday. Burning has to go to school. You can go to school tomorrow afternoon and wait for her.”

“Okay.”Song Shiyu nodded slightly.

The grandfather and grandson spoke a little more before song Shiyu left.

Looking at song Shiyu’s back, Old Madam song sighed.

She was really afraid that after she left, song Shiyu would be alone for the rest of his life.

...

Today was Monday.

In the morning, Ye Zhuo finished breakfast and went to school.

Just as he was about to reach school, a surprised voice came from behind. “Ye Zhuo?”

Ye Zao looked back slightly and saw Li Boyang.

“What’s the matter?”

Li Boyang looked at ye Zao, whom he had not seen for several days, with a complicated expression on his face.

What surprised Li Boyang the most was the coat ye Zao was wearing.

That Was...

The school uniform of the North Bridge?

The school uniform of the North Bridge was blue and white, wide and fat. Many students were not willing to wear it, but on her body, there was an unspeakable purity.

It also corresponded to the saying that a beautiful person would still be beautiful even if she wore a sack.

She just stood there, even if she didn’t do anything.

She had satisfied all the fantasies of a young boy who had just opened his heart for his first love.

Li Boyang was slightly stunned.

Could it be that ye Zhuo was really a student of North Bridge High School?

But didn’t Qian Lingyu say that Ye Zhuo was a delinquent who didn’t even graduate from middle school?

Or did ye Zao buy this school uniform online?

Nowadays, many people in the society liked to wear school uniforms to pretend to be students.

Thinking of this.

Li Boyang heaved a sigh of relief.

Ye Zao was so beautiful, she definitely wouldn’t be able to enter North Bridge High School.

She was just trying to satisfy her vanity.

“Ye Zao, my mom gave you such a high salary last time, but you didn’t want to work at my house. Did you find a better job?”So what if she found a better job? Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

No culture or no culture.

Ye Zao held his school bag with one hand and said calmly, “I want to go to school. I don’t have time to work.”

Li Boyang didn’t expose ye Zao and continued, “You’re at North Bridge?”

Ye Zao nodded.

At this moment, Li Boyang was very impressed with ye Zao.

Her inner world was too strong. Even when she was lying, she could still maintain her composure.

Perhaps this was the difference between those who had read books and those who had not.

A good student like him would never lie.

Li Boyang continued, “The college entrance exam is coming up soon. Which University do you plan to enter?”
