Chapter 146: 084: Bad Karma, Lin Ze came to yunjing! 5

The daily communication of the family of three was all replaced by English.

What happened in the Ye family’s hometown did not have any substantial impact on the two of them.

On the 11th day of the first lunar month.

Lin Ze secretly bought a plane ticket to yunjing.

Originally, he was preparing to come to Yunjing on the 8th day of the first lunar month.

But he was delayed by some things.

He didn’t bring anything but a cell phone, a laptop, and a few change of clothes.

The temperature difference between yunjing and capital city was very big.

The coldest time in capital city, the temperature was around-18 degrees Celsius. The coldest time in Yunjing was one or two degrees Celsius.

Although the temperature in Yunjing was not as low as that in capital city.

But this kind of cold in Yunjing was different from that in capital city.

It was dry and cold in Yunjing.

As soon as he got off the plane, Lin Ze Shivered.

Yunjing was a very unfamiliar city to Lin Ze. He took out his cell phone and found the location of the hotel. Then, Lin Ze got into a taxi.

The driver was a talkative middle-aged man. He saw Lin Ze’s outfit in the rear mirror and asked, “Young man, are you a foreigner?”

“Yes.”Lin Ze nodded.

“Then where are you from?”The middle-aged driver asked.

“Beijing,”Lin ze answered. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The middle-aged driver said in surprise, “Beijing is thousands of kilometers away from here! It takes more than four hours by plane. Young Man, are you here to visit Yunjing?”

Yunjing was a tourist city, but there was nothing to visit in winter.

Usually, there were more people in the three seasons of spring, summer, and autumn.

“No.”Lin Ze couldn’t tell what he felt when he set foot on the land of Yunjing. “I’m here to find my mother.”

At this moment, was he and his mother breathing the same breath of the Sky?

Would he be able to see his mother as he wished on this trip?

Lin Ze leaned against the back of his chair.

Ignoring the cold, he opened the car window and took a deep breath of the cold air.

“Young man, Are You Carsick?”The driver asked.

Lin Ze did not deny it. “Yes.”

The driver continued, “Young Man, is your mother from Yun Jing?”

“Probably.”Lin Ze’s voice was very faint.

The driver smiled and said, “You don’t even know where your mother is from?”

Lin Ze shook his head gently. “I’ve never seen my mother since I was young.”

The driver was stunned. The smile on his face froze at the corner of his mouth. He turned to look at Lin ze and said apologetically, “I’m sorry about that young man.”

“It’s okay.”

The driver continued, “Young man, don’t be discouraged. Uncle believes that one day, you’ll be able to find your mother! Right, what’s Your Mother’s name? I’ve been driving a taxi in Yun Jing for 20 years. Tell me about it. Maybe I know her.”

“I don’t know.”

“Ah?”The driver was stunned. He continued, “Then do you have a photo of your mother?”

Lin Ze shook his head.

“You haven’t seen your mother since you were young?”The driver asked softly.

Lin Ze nodded.

How Pitiful!

Such a young child.

The driver sighed in his heart.

“Then why did you come alone? Where’s your father?”

“He’s very seriously ill.”

The expression on the driver’s face became even more solemn.

There were no clues at all. It was like looking for a needle in a haystack.

Before getting off the car, the driver Uncle told Lin Ze, “Young man, although Yunjing is a good place, there are a lot of swindlers. When you are alone outside, you must be careful not to be deceived! Uncle wishes you to find your mother as soon as possible! A Family Reunion!”

“Thank you.”Lin Ze handed the money to the middle-aged driver and took the opportunity to bow.

This child really knows how to be polite!

The middle-aged driver sighed in his heart.

Beijing.

Feng Qianhua made some handmade snacks and had Feng Qianqian send them over to Lin Ze.

Although she was no longer prepared to curry favor with Lin Ze.

She still had to put on a show.

Feng Qianqian said, “Lin Ze isn’t at home.”

“Not at home?”Feng Qianhua continued, “Where did he go?”

“I think he went to sea city for a vacation.”Feng Qianqian didn’t take this matter to heart.

Go To Sea City for a vacation?

School was about to start soon. Why would Lin ze go to sea city for a vacation?

Lin Ze had a dull personality since he was young. He didn’t speak much and was very much like Lin Jincheng.

How could he go out for a vacation! !

Feng Qianhua subconsciously felt that there must be something going on here. She immediately put down the snacks in her hands and walked upstairs.

Upstairs, she made a call. “Hello, Check Lin Ze’s recent whereabouts for me.”

“Okay.”

The waiting time was torturous.

The more she didn’t get a reply, the more uneasy Feng Qianhua felt.
