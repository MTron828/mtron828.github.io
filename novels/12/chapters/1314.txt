Translator: 549690339

“”I still say that all assessments are fair and just. Everyone will depend on their own abilities.”Ye Zhuo continued, “The assessment has already started. Auntie, I’ll be leaving first.” ”

Zhou Xiang nodded. “Then go quickly.”

Xie wanqiu looked at ye Zhuo’s back and narrowed her eyes.

“She was Cen Shaoqing’s grandmother. If ye Zhuo wanted to marry into the Cen family, he had to get her approval. ”

She did not believe that ye Zhuo would dare to refuse!

It looked like.

Zheng Wanyin was definitely going to get 3A!

“While she was excited, Xie Wanqiu picked up her phone and sent a message to Zheng Wanyin, telling her to focus on the assessment and wait for her to get 3a. ”

“When she saw the message, Zheng Wanyin was also very excited. ”

“There were a total of 105 contestants today. If one of them used a backdoor, they would snatch their spots away. ”

But it was different now.

“With Xie Wanqiu around, she would definitely be able to get 3a. ”

Zheng Wanyin deleted the message and walked towards the assessment venue with everyone.

“The short-haired girl walked to Zheng Wanyin’s side and held her hand. “I’m so nervous! Wanyin, are you nervous?” ”

Zheng Wanyin smiled. “What’s there to be nervous about? Just bring out your usual strength.”

“The short-haired girl said enviously, “Wanyin, you’re really too strong! Right, do you plan to get into 2A or 3A?” ”

“Zheng wanyin said, “I think I definitely want to get into 3A, but there are too few spots for 3A, but 2A shouldn’t be a problem.” ” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Actually, she had already decided on 3A. ”

But one had to be humble.

“The short-haired girl said, “Looking at you, not to mention 2A, 3a definitely won’t be a problem.” ”

“Zheng wanyin smiled and said, “With your good words, I’ll treat you to a meal after the assessment ends.” ”

“”Sure,”the short-haired girl said. ”

“As the two of them spoke, they walked into the assessment venue. ”

The assessment arena was very solemn.

There was not a single sound of conversation.

There were a total of seven assessment officers and one main assessment officer.

“After the seven assessment officers had approved the results of all the assessment members, they handed them over to the main assessment officer for assessment. After that, they would evaluate the final performance. ”

The assessment time was a total of two hours.

Zheng Wanyin was full of confidence in herself. She had even handed in her papers 30 minutes earlier.

She was the first to hand in her papers in advance and was also the last.

“The examiner sitting in the front took the papers that Zheng Wanyin had handed over and could not help but be a little surprised. “Once the papers are handed over to me, there is no possibility of going back on your words. Are you sure you want to hand them in?” ”

“Zheng Wanyin nodded. “Yes, I’m sure.” ”

“Alright.”The examiner put away the papers and looked at the answers on them before looking at Zheng Wanyin again.

It was hard to tell what expression he had in his eyes.

Zheng Wanyin was a little happy.

It must be because the accuracy of her paper was too high. That was why the examiner had such an expression.

“Thinking of this, Zheng Wanyin’s footsteps became even lighter. ”

The short-haired girl looked at Zheng Wanyin’s back with envy in her eyes.

Zheng Wanyin was really too amazing!

“When they arrived at the family seat, Xie Wanqiu asked with a smile, “How do you feel, Yinyin?” ”

“”Not bad, right?”Zheng wanyin said, “2A shouldn’t be a problem.” ”

“Xie wanqiu smiled and said, “This child is just too modest.” ”

Zheng Wanyin glanced at CEN Shaoqing from the corner of her eye.

“Cen Shaoqing just sat there, holding a string of bright red Buddhist beads in his left hand. There was no special expression on his face. ”

“Without ye Zao by his side, he seemed to have returned to his former self. ”

He wondered if Cen Shaoqing had seen the scene where she asked ye Zao to leave the position of assessment officer before the assessment.

“Even though it had been a few hours since the incident, Zheng Wanyin was extremely embarrassed whenever she thought of that scene. She wished she could dig a hole and hide in it. ”

She did not see it.

Cen Shaoqing definitely did not see that scene.

“Two hours later, the results of the assessment members were announced. ”

“Zheng Wanyin stood with the short-haired girl, her face full of anxiety and excitement. ”

“The short-haired girl said, “Wanyin, what should we do! I can’t possibly not even get 1a!” ”

“”No Way, no way!”Zheng wanyin comforted, “Jingjing, you’re so amazing. If you don’t say 3A, 2A will definitely not be a problem.” ”

“Really?”Liu Jingjing instantly saw hope.

“”Of course it’s true.”Zheng wanyin smiled and said, “I’m full of confidence in you.” ”

“”Bai Xiaosu!”At this moment, the examiner called Bai Xiaosu’s name. ”

Bai Xiaosu walked to the front to get the report card.

Everyone was very curious.

“What Will Bai Xiaosu take the test for?”

“WHO KNOWS!”

“”Is there even a need to think about it? For someone like her, it’s already good enough to pass! How Many A’s do you expect her to get?” ”
