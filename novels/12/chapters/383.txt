Translator: 549690339

“President Mu! PL company suddenly broke the contract and said they would cancel the meeting in the afternoon!”

“”President Mu! The death of a construction worker in the north has been exposed by the family! Now, the higher-ups have banned the construction!” ”

“President Mu! The local tax bureau said that we are suspected of tax evasion and asked you to cooperate with their investigation!”

“Chief Mu...”

“In just one morning, soldier mu seemed to have aged more than ten years. ”

“Soldier Mu had been in the business world for more than thirty years. Naturally, he knew that this was not a coincidence. ”

Someone was deliberately targeting the MU family!

Because it was impossible for everything to erupt at the same time.

What should he do now?

“At this moment, soldier Mu thought of Cen Wu Ye! ”

Right!

And fifth Master Cen! 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“The last time the MU family encountered a financial crisis, it was fifth Master Cen who had asked Li Qiandong to take care of it! ”

“Fifth Master Cen liked Mu Yourong so much, and this time, he definitely would not just watch the MU family fall. ”

“With this in mind, a huge rock in general Mu’s heart finally fell to the ground, and he immediately rushed back to the MU family. ”

Shen Rong was meeting a few wealthy ladies at home to play cards.

“When she saw that soldier Mu had returned, Shen Rong asked somewhat strangely, “Old Mu, why are You Back Now?” ”

“Soldier Mu did not answer. Instead, he asked, “Where’s yourong?” ”

“”She’s upstairs reading a book,”Shen Rong said as she threw out three cakes. ”

The lady sitting below her was so happy that flowers bloomed. “Bang! I’m Done!”

“Shen Rong said in a speechless manner, “You can even win this? Why is my luck so bad today!” ”

Soldier Mu walked upstairs.

Mu Yourong was sitting in her room reading a book.

“On the surface, she was reading, but in reality, she was calling the system back. ”

Unfortunately.

“She called the system many times in her heart, but the system still did not reply. ”

“Just then, there was a knock on the door. ”

“Mu Yourong’s thoughts were interrupted by the knock on the door. She put down her book and walked over to open the door. When she saw who it was, Mu Yourong said in surprise, “Dad, why are you back?” ”

“Soldier mu said, “Yourong, something big has happened! Let’s go to the study and talk!” ”

“Okay.”Mu Yourong nodded and followed soldier Mu’s footsteps.

“The father and daughter came to the study, and soldier Mu began to talk about the current situation of the MU group. ”

“Hearing this, Mu Yourong’s face turned pale. “How could this be?” ”

Soldier Mu frowned. “I suspect that someone is deliberately targeting us!”

Someone was deliberately targeting the MU corporation?

Mu Yourong narrowed her eyes.

Who was this person?

Was It song Shiyu?

“After all, in her previous life, Song Shiyu had single-handedly destroyed the MU Corporation. ”

“But in this life, she had not provoked song Shiyu! ”

But...

“Besides song Shiyu, who else was there? ”

Could It Be... Ye Zhuo?

“Thinking of this, Mu Yourong’s brows twitched. ”

Could it be that ye Zao already knew that she was the one who had done that thing last night?

But how did ye Zao Find Out?

“For a moment, Mu Yourong fell into deep thought. ”

“Soldier Mu continued, “Yourong! Quickly contact young master Li and get him to help us tide over this crisis!” ”

“No matter what, the MU family could not fall! ”

“Because of the financial crisis last time, relying on Li Qiandong’s backing, soldier Mu had offended quite a number of people. ”

He couldn’t let those people see him as a joke!

He couldn’t!

“Mu Yourong lowered her head to look at Soldier Mu. “Father, don’t be anxious. I’ll go look for Li Qiandong right now! Don’t worry, he definitely won’t sit idly by!”From Li Qiandong’s eyes, it could be seen that he liked her very much now! ”

It was just that he didn’t dare to confess because of fifth master Cen.

“As long as she inadvertently mentioned the Mu family’s problem, Li Qiandong would definitely step in to resolve it. ”

“This was because Li Qiandong, this stepping stone, couldn’t bear to see her suffer any grievances or harm. ”

“Hearing this, soldier mu heaved a sigh of relief. “Then I’ll wait for Your Good News at the company.” ”

“Mm.”Mu Yourong nodded.

Mu Yourong returned to her room to change her clothes and put on some light makeup before leaving.

Only when she got into the car did mu yourong realize that she had overlooked one thing.

“That was, she no longer had the system. ”

“Without the help of the system, it would still be a little difficult for her to run into Li Qiandong by chance. ”

“After all, Yunjing was so big. ”

What should she do now?

“Mu Yourong sat in the driver’s seat, her brows tightly furrowed. ”

“Time waited for no one. In this situation, she could only go to the orphanage to try her luck. ”

And so.

Mu Yourong drove in the direction of the orphanage.

“Little did she know that a black car had quietly followed her, maintaining a distance that was neither too far nor too close. ”

Only when she reached the orphanage did Mu Yourong realize that Li Qiandong had just left.

“And so, Mu Yourong drove to the place where she had often met Li Qiandong. ”
