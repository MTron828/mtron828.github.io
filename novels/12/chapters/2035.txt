“Really?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“Yes.”The youth nodded.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Then you lead the way.” ”

“Okay.”The youth nodded and walked to the front to lead the way.

Yi Ling came out of the bag. “Wait!”

“What’s Wrong?”Ye Zhuo looked back slightly.

“Yi Ling continued, “What if this bad boy tries to trick us!” ”

“Hearing this, the youth was so anxious that his face turned red. “No! I didn’t! I would never lie to Grandma! Grandma, you have to believe me!” ”

“Lead the way.”Ye Zao’s tone was indifferent.

“”Thank you, Grandma!”The youth walked forward quickly. ”

“Yi Ling jumped onto ye Zao’s shoulder and said with some worry, “Da Zao Zao, do you trust him that much! I keep feeling that this Guangxing is a little strange!” ”

“”Don’t worry, he didn’t lie to us,”ye Zao said. ”

“How do you know?”Yi Ling asked.

Ye Zao followed the youth’s footsteps quickly. “I can see it in his eyes.”

“Yi Ling nodded. “However, we can’t be careless. Da Zao, it’s not wrong for us to be more cautious.” ”

“Okay.”

“Soon, the youth brought ye Zao to a door. ”

“The youth pressed the switch on the wall, and the hidden door opened. ”

Rumble!

Outside the door was the blue sky and white clouds.

“Looking at the scene, this was the back door of the Guang family residence. ”

“”Grandma, Let’s go quickly.”The youth turned to look at Ye Zao. ”

Ye Zao nodded slightly and followed.

“The two walked out of the secret passage, and the door behind them closed. ”

No one could tell that there was a secret door here.

Ye Zhuo brought Guang Xing onto the flying machine.

“On the way, the clothes spirit circled around Guang Xing. ”

“Guang Xing’s Head was a little dizzy from the shaking, so he closed his eyes and didn’t look at it. ”

“The clothes spirit narrowed her eyes, “Why don’t you dare to look at me? Are you feeling guilty?” ”

“”No,”Guang Xing said. ”

“Then why do you have to close your eyes?”The clothes spirit asked.

“”I Feel Dizzy,”Guang Xing said. ”

“Yi Ling landed on his shoulder and continued, “Aren’t you the biological son of the sixth clan leader?” ”

“I don’t know.”

“Why did the sixth clan leader Lock You in an iron cage?”Yi Ling asked.

“”Maybe he felt that I embarrassed him.”The corner of the youth’s mouth revealed a bitter smile, “He is the high and mighty sixth clan leader. How can he tolerate a son with mental problems? In this world, only Grandma and mother don’t dislike me!” ”

“”You...”at this point, the spirit pointed at its own head, “You have a problem here?” ”

“The youth was silent for a moment. He didn’t say anything. After a moment, he nodded. ”

The spirit was stunned.

“To be honest, other than calling ye Zhuo grandmother, it really couldn’t see what was wrong with Guangxing. ”

“After a while, the spirit continued, “Then how long have you been locked up?” ”

“The youth shook his head slightly and continued, “I only know that I was 15 years old when I was locked up.” ”

“After that, he led a dark life. ”

He did not even know whether it was day or night.

“Yi Ling widened her eyes in disbelief. “So, you’ve been locked up for five years! You Don’t even know what year it is?” ”

The youth continued to shake his head.

He actually didn’t even know what year it was.

“Hearing this, Yi Ling’s eyes instantly turned red. “Sob sob sob sob sob... you’re too pitiful! A tiger doesn’t eat its cubs, how can the sixth clan leader Be Like This!”Even if Guang Xing’s mental state was really problematic.., the sixth clan leader shouldn’t have locked him up! ”

“The youth continued, “Then it’s the year 10026, right?” ”

“”Yes.”Yi ling nodded and continued, “Poor child, don’t worry. Follow da Zhuozhuo, no one will dare to lock you up in that large iron cage in the future!” ”

“Da Zhuozhuo?”The youth frowned slightly.

“Yi Ling said, “AH, it’s your grandmother!” ”

“OH.”The youth nodded.

“Soon, the aircraft stopped in front of a building. ”

“Ye Zhuo stood up and said, “Let’s go down first.” ”

The youth immediately stood up as well.

“Entering the house, Ye Zhuo brought him into the bathroom. “Take a shower first. I’ll Get Yi Ling to bring the clothes in for you later.” ”

“Okay.”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Do you know how to use all the things you take a shower with?” ”

The youth shook his head.

“”I’ll teach you.”Ye Zao did it in front of him once. Fortunately, the youth had a good memory and quickly memorized it. ” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Ye Zao closed the bathroom door.

“Soon, the sound of running water came from the bathroom. ”

“Yi Ling brought a bag of clothes. “Then, open the door! I’ll send you clothes!” ”

“The next second, the bathroom door was opened and a slender hand stretched out from inside. ”

“The skin was very white, a very unhealthy kind of pale. ”

“Yi Ling placed the bag on his hand and continued, “Oh right, did great burning teach you how to cut hair just now?” ”

“”Yes,”the youth said. ”

“Then cut your hair a little. Your hair is too long!”

“Mm.”

“After saying this, Yi Ling flew to Ye Zao’s laboratory. “Great burning.” ”

“HM?”Ye Zao looked back slightly.

“”I feel that Guangxing is so miserable! How can there be a father like the sixth clan leader!”Yi Ling continued, “What kind of stimulation did guangxing suffer before he went crazy?” ”

Ye Zao picked up the glasses on the table and put them on. “It should be related to Guangxing’s mother.”

“Once she put on the glasses, she seemed to have changed into a different person. ”

The smell of books filled the air.

“Isn’t Guangxing’s mother missing?”Yi Ling asked.

“Ye Zhuo flipped open the books on the table, then he said, “I just checked. Guangxing’s mother is not missing. She should have been killed by the sixth chief by accident. The fifteen-year-old Guangxing hid outside the door and saw everything, so he was provoked!” ”

Yi Ling frowned. “I really didn’t see that the sixth chief is such a person! I used to think he was quite good!”

“He also has a motive for getting close to you.”Ye Zhuo’s tone was indifferent.

“What motive?”Yi Ling immediately asked.

“Ye Zhuo said, “Your body contains a special medicine. As long as you are used as a medicinal lure, Guangxing will be able to return to normal.” ”

“The sixth clan leader was a person who valued reputation above everything else. He could not bring Guangxing to the hospital, so he set his gaze on Yi Ling. ”

“”F * ck!”Hearing this, Yi Ling could not remain calm, “I was wondering why he was so good to me! So there was a conspiracy!” ”

“After saying this, Yi Ling continued, “Great Burning, don’t tell me you’re also going to use me as a medicinal lure for your eldest grandson?” ”

“Ye Zhuo laughed lightly, “You Guess?” ”

“”I guess it definitely won’t be!”His collar fell on ye Zhuo’s shoulder, “Great burning is the best for me!” ”

On the other side.

There was still one more day before the Changyue Kingdom’s general election.

The next day.

The first lady of the mother of the Manxing Kingdom personally came to the Changyue kingdom to congratulate Qiu di.

Ye Lan was very excited when she heard the news.

She was here to pick her up!

Her mother had finally come to pick her up!

Ye Lan washed up and dressed up before arriving at the Qiu residence.

“The First Lady of the Manxing Kingdom was surnamed Zhao, and her single name was Dan. ”

“The moment she saw Zhao Dan, four words appeared in front of Ye Lan’s eyes. ”

The mother of the world.

This unique temperament of the mother of the nation was something that ordinary people could not imitate.

“”Mom!”After so many years, ye Lan finally saw her mother, and her eyes instantly turned red. ”

Mom?

“Zhao Dan frowned slightly and turned to look at Qiu Di. “Miss Qiu, this is?” ”

“Just as Qiu Di was about to speak, ye Lan said, “Mother! I’m your daughter, Full Moon!” ”

She wanted to tell her mother personally that she was not dead and that she was still alive!

Full Moon.

“Upon hearing this name, Zhao Dan’s expression turned extremely ugly. “Where did this crazy woman come from!” ”

“Qiu Di immediately smiled and said, “Madam, she is indeed mentally ill. Don’t lower yourself to her level.” ”

“After saying this, Qiu di turned to look at his assistant. “Zhou Qing! Hurry up and chase this deranged woman out!” ”

“Hearing this, Ye Lan was immediately stunned. ”
