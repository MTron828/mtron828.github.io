Bai Jingshu looked at Lin Ze’s hand and was unable to react for a long time.

It was as if she was dreaming.

“One second, she was still worrying about her gains and losses, and the next second, she was confessed to by the person she liked. ”

“Bai Jingshu raised her hand gently and placed it on Lin Ze’s hand. “Mr. Lin Ze, actually, I like you too.” ”

Lin Ze gently pulled Bai Jingshu into his embrace.

The scent of hormones that was exclusive to men wafted over. Bai Jingshu hugged Lin ze tightly with a smile on her face.

“Lin Ze continued, “Jingshu, from today onwards, we’ll be boyfriend and girlfriend.” ”

“Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded.

The two of them foolishly hugged each other at the intersection where people came and went.

“After an unknown amount of time, they finally let go of each other. Like many couples, they held hands and began to walk on the road, chatting about life. ”

“From ten o’clock in the evening until twelve o’clock, the two of them seemed to have a lot to talk about. ”

“Unintentionally, Bai Jingshu saw the clock on the opposite building and was stunned. “It’s already half past twelve!” ”

“She felt that only a few minutes had passed, but two hours had already passed. ”

Lin Ze also felt that time had passed a little too quickly. “I’ll send you home.”

“Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded.

“Lin Ze wanted to go back and drive, but he realized that the car had stopped ten kilometers away. ”

“Unknowingly, the two of them had already walked for such a long time. ”

“It was definitely impossible to walk ten kilometers back directly, so Lin Ze could only call an online car-hailing service and return to where he was. ”

Bai Jingshu was also taken aback. “We actually made it this far.”

“”That’s right,”Lin ze said with a smile. ”

“In the past, he still did not understand why couples would be so sweet. Wouldn’t two people who were already extremely familiar with each other get tired of spending all day together? ”

It was only now that he realized that the two of them really had so much to talk about when they were together.

“At half past twelve, the car arrived at Bai Jingshu’s house on time. ”

Lin Ze opened the door of the driver’s seat and went around to the passenger seat to open the door for Bai Jingshu.

“”Thank you,”Bai Jingshu said. ” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“What are you talking about!”Lin Ze patted Bai Jingshu’s head.

“Bai Jingshu was 1.6 meters tall. She was neither tall nor short among girls, but Lin Ze was much taller than her. It could be said that he was the cutest height difference in real life. ”

“You’re So Tall!”Bai Jingshu looked up at her.

“Bai Jingshu hadn’t noticed it before, but now she realized that Lin Ze was actually so much taller than her. ”

“Lin Ze nodded and gestured. “Yes, I’m just a little taller than you.” ”

“”I suspect that you’re implying something about me, and I have evidence,”Bai Jingshu said. ”

“Do I look like the type of person who knows how to imply things?”Lin Ze looked at Bai Jingshu.

Bai Jingshu nodded seriously. “Of course.”

“When she didn’t know Lin Ze in the past, Bai Jingshu had thought that Lin ze was the type of person who was cold and aloof. Now, she realized that Lin Ze was not. ”

“”Seriously, how tall are you?”Bai Jingshu asked. ”

“”188,”Lin ze answered. ”

“”No Wonder,”Bai Jingshu continued, “I feel like my dad is 180, much shorter than you!” ”

“Are you only 159?”Lin Ze asked with a smile.

“”How is that possible!”Bai Jingshu retorted immediately. “I’m 160, okay?” ”

The two things that girls cared about the most were height and weight.

“Lin Ze continued, “It’s okay. I like your person, not your height.” ”

“It was a very simple sentence, but it made Bai Jingshu’s face turn red. ”

“”Alright, Hurry up and go in.”Lin Ze patted Bai Jingshu’s head. “I’ll text you when we get home.” ”

“”Okay, drive slowly on the road,”Bai Jingshu said. ”

Lin Ze nodded. “I will.”

“On the way back, Lin ze whistled softly, feeling extremely happy. ”

It was almost 1:10 pm when they returned to the Lin family manor.

“Ye Shu wasn’t asleep yet. When she heard footsteps, she immediately stood up from the sofa. “Ah Ze is back.” ”

“”Mom,”Lin Ze was stunned when he saw ye Shu. “Why aren’t you asleep yet?” ”

“”I saw that you weren’t back yet, so I waited for you,”ye Shu said. ”

“In the past, Lin Ze would always give her a heads-up when he came back late. This time, he didn’t come back at 1:30 pm. Ye Shu was really anxious. ”

“Hearing Ye Shu’s answer, Lin Ze felt a little guilty. He shouldn’t have let ye Shu wait for so long... ”

“Then why didn’t you call me?”Lin Ze continued to ask.

“Ye Shu continued, “I did, but your phone was turned off.” ”

“”Turned off?”Hearing this, Lin Ze immediately took out his phone. Sure enough, his phone had automatically turned off. “Mom, I’m sorry. My phone turned off when it ran out of battery.” ”
