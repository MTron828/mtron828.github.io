“Zhao shuning said, “Mom, look at how filial Qianhua is! Unlike the one in the front yard! It’s been so long, and she hasn’t come to see you once! I think she doesn’t take you, her mother, seriously at all!””

“Hearing this, Old Mrs. Lin’s eyes were full of anger. She recalled what Lin Jincheng said last night and was even more furious!”

How could a B * tch like ye Shu compare to Feng Qianhua?

“Feng Qianhua looked at Old Mrs. Lin in the eye and immediately said, “Aunt Lin, don’t be angry. I don’t think brother Jincheng and sister ye Shu are at home. Did they go to change the surname of Searing Flames?””

“Zhao shuning continued, “Qianhua, it’s fine if you don’t mention it. But once you say it, our mother will probably be even angrier!””

“”What’s Wrong?”Feng Qianhua asked in surprise. “Aunt Lin didn’t agree to change Zhuozhuo’s surname? Aunt Lin, don’t be stubborn. No matter what, Zhuozhuo is brother Jin Cheng’s child. She is the Lin family’s flesh and blood. How can you let the Lin family’s flesh and blood take an outsider’s surname? If this is seen by people who don’t know, they will think that brother Jin Cheng has married into the Ye family!””

This sentence was like adding fuel to the fire.

Old Madam Lin’s face turned pale.

“Feng Qianhua pretended to be confused. “Aunt Lin, did I say something wrong?””

“Zhao shuning said, “It’s not that you said something wrong! It’s that someone didn’t want to change that wild girl’s surname!””

“”Didn’t want to?”Feng qianhua frowned and said, “Besides Aunt Lin, who else wouldn’t want to? After all, Fiery Blaze was originally surnamed Lin. Now that we’ve recognized her, it’s only natural that she should change her surname!””

“”Who else but that Vixen!”Zhao shuning continued, “In the past, Jin city was a very obedient and filial son. In the end, that Vixen didn’t even marry into our Lin family for half a day before she caused chaos in our Lin Family!””

“Feng Qianhua said in surprise, “Is it sister Ye Shu who is unwilling?””

“Yes.”Zhao shuning nodded.

Feng Qianhua frowned. “Sister Ye Shu is not the kind of unreasonable person. Is there a misunderstanding?”

“”What misunderstanding could there be!”Zhao shuning continued to add fuel to the fire, “Qianhua, you didn’t see how Jin City treated our mother last night! He even wanted to sever the mother-son relationship with our mother for that Vixen!””

“”No, it can’t be?”Feng Qianhua’s face was filled with disbelief.”

“”An unfilial son!”Old Madam Lin suddenly sobbed. “I raised an unfilial son! It’s all that B * Tch Ye Shu’s fault! If it weren’t for her, our Lin family wouldn’t be in this state today!””

Zhao shuning quickly comforted old madam Lin.

“Feng Qianhua frowned. “Brother Jin Cheng was indeed wrong in this matter. No matter what, you are his mother and the person who gave him life. How could he treat you like this!””

“After saying that.., feng Qianhua continued, “To put it bluntly, asking burning to change her surname means that he thinks highly of her! Not everyone has the right to have the surname Lin! Even if she doesn’t want to change her surname to Lin, she can’t follow Ye Shu’s surname! She’s obviously a child of the Lin family, but she has an outsider’s surname. Isn’t that a joke?””

“Zhao shuning narrowed his eyes. “Qianhua, who do you think her surname should be?””

“Feng Qianhua said, “I think if she doesn’t want her surname to be Lin, she should follow Aunt Lin’s surname, Zhao! No matter what, Aunt Lin is this old lady. Ye Shu doesn’t have the right to let her child follow her surname!””

“”Qianhua,”Zhao shuning agreed with Feng Qianhua’s words and nodded. “I think you’re right! This ye Zhuo should follow our mother’s surname and be called Zhao Zhuo!””

“Feng Qianhua continued, “Anyway, if I were sister Ye Shu, my daughter’s surname would be either Lin or Zhao.””

Feng Qianhua’s words touched Old Lady Lin’s heart.

Why wasn’t Feng Qianhua her daughter-in-law? FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Why couldn’t a good mother-in-law meet a reasonable daughter-in-law?

“”It’s not nice to be called Zhao Zhuo,”old lady lin continued, “Why don’t you just change your name to Zhao Linzhuo!””

Feng Qianhua nodded. “It’s very thoughtful of you to bring both families’surnames with you.”

“Zhao shuning said worriedly, “If they don’t agree to the change, it’s useless for us to discuss so much!””

“Old Mrs. Lin narrowed her eyes, “Shuning, if that b * Tch Ye Shu comes back later, call her over! I don’t believe that she can rebel against the heavens! If she dares to disagree, tell her to get the hell out of the Lin Family!””
