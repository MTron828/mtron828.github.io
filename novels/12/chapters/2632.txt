Li hang frowned slightly. “This matter is indeed a little strange. Let Me Make a call and ask.”

“After saying that, Li Hang went to call the detective agency. ”

“Very soon, the call was connected. ”

“Ten minutes later, Li hang hung up the phone. ”

“Zhou cuihua asked anxiously, “What did they say?” ”

“Li hang said, “The Detective Agency said that Xia Xiaoman is doing fine. They didn’t find any mistresses.” ”

“Impossible!”Zhou cuihua said.

“Li hang nodded. “I also think it’s impossible, but that’s what the detective agency said.”If Xia Xiaoman was normal, then how did Lin Zhi come out? ”

“Would a rich man not have children for more than 20 years after marriage, and then have children after his second marriage? ”

It was impossible!

“After saying that, Li hang continued, “But mom, don’t be anxious. The detective agency is still investigating. Maybe we’ll have a result in a few days.” ”

“Zhou cuihua said, “There’s nothing we can do even if we’re anxious now. This Xia Xiaoman hid herself too well. No wonder Lin Qingxuan never found out.” ”

Even a professional detective didn’t find out about Xia Xiaoman’s problem. How could an ordinary person like Lin Qingxuan find out!

Zhou Cuihua’s only wish now was to see Xia Xiaoman being kicked out of the house as soon as possible!

“Li hang continued, “Mom, have you contacted Uncle Wang during this period of time? When does he plan to hold a wedding with you?” ” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Zhou cuihua shook her head. “We haven’t mentioned this topic for the time being.”

“”How can that be! Although we have already lived here, have you lost anything between the two of you? What will you do if uncle Wang falls in love with someone else one day?”Li Hang said. ”

“”Then what should we do?”Zhou cuihua continued, “Your uncle Wang shouldn’t be such a person, right?” ”

“”People’s hearts are unpredictable. Anything Can Happen!”Li hang continued, “However, this kind of thing can not be directly mentioned by the woman. You can be more tactful.” ”

“If Zhou Cuihua pursued him too hastily, it would instead have the opposite effect. ”

“”En.”Zhou cuihua nodded. “Then when I chat with your uncle Wang Tonight, I’ll talk to him.” ”

“Okay.”

A month passed just like that.

“During this period of time, Zhou Cuihua had been waiting for the detective agency’s reply. ”

“At noon, Zhou Cuihua had just arranged for her mahjong partner to come to her house to play mahjong. At this time, a man in a suit suddenly appeared. “Excuse me, is this Ms. Zhou Cuihua?” ”

“I am.”Zhou cuihua stood up.

“The man continued, “Hello, I am the person-in-charge of happy residence. Would you like to renew your stay or check out?” ”

“Check out?”Zhou Cui Hua was stunned. “You must be mistaken! This house is mine!”

“The man smiled and said, “The house you are staying in now is rented by Mr. Wang Zhengxuan. He rented it for half a year previously. Now that half a year has passed, this is our contract.” ”

“After saying that, the man handed the contract to Zhou Cui Hua. ”

Zhou Cui Hua took the contract and her face turned pale. She immediately shouted for Li hang upstairs.

“Hang Hang Hang Hang Hang!”

“Li hang answered, “Mom, What’s Wrong?” ”

“”Hang Hang, look at this!” ”

Li Hang took the contract from Zhou Cuihua’s hand and his expression turned grave bit by bit.

How could this be!

Boss Wang’s small house was actually rented!

Rented!

“In that case, what they had seen in the past few days was just an illusion. ”

“The man continued, “May I know if the two of you want to continue staying or give up the rental? If you want to continue staying, we’ll start renting from one month. The rent is 100,000 yuan per month.” ”

“Li Hang looked at the man and tried his best to calm himself down. “Wait a moment, I’ll make a call first.” ”

“Okay.”

“Li hang then looked at Zhou Cuihua. “Mom, give me your phone.” ”

Zhou cuihua immediately gave the phone to Li Hang.

“Li hang turned on the phone and started to call boss Wang’s number, but there was a notification on the other end of the phone that said the phone was off. ”
