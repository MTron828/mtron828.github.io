Translator: 549690339

The old lady was wearing a burgundy embroidered cheongsam and held a dragon-headed walking stick in her hand. She looked very dignified.

This scene stunned old master Bai and he rubbed his eyes in disbelief.

This...

This was really old lady Shangguan!

“Although Old Lady Shangguan had lived in seclusion for many years, the myths about her still circulated in the room. ”

The story of the Shangguan family was similar to that of the female generals of the Yang family.

“Back then, there was a riot in the F galaxy. All the men of the Shangguan family had died on the battlefield and their bodies had been wrapped up in a coffin. However, the Shangguan family did not give up. When the men died in battle, the women would replace them. ”

“If not for the Shangguan family back then, there would be no peace in the F Galaxy Now. Therefore, the Shangguan family had a supreme position in the F galaxy. ”

Old Lady Shangguan had a grandson.

“Unfortunately, he died young... ”

“Although he recognized that it was Old Lady Shangguan, Old Man Bai still couldn’t believe his eyes. ”

Why did Old Lady Shangguan come?

The guests who were watching the show couldn’t stay calm anymore and started to discuss.

“Bai Jingshu was beautiful. Perhaps a junior in the family had taken a liking to her, but he was too embarrassed to ask, so he begged Old Lady Shangguan to come. ”

“Before old master Bai could react, Old Lady Shangguan stood up from her chair and said, “Old Master Bai, it’s too abrupt to pay a visit without permission!” ”

“Old Master Bai immediately said, “You must be joking, Old Lady. It’s my honor to have you come to my humble abode. Please take a seat!” ”

“Old Lady Shangguan smiled and said, “I’m here today to give a betrothal gift to the heir of the Shangguan family.” ”

Betrothal gift?

The heir of the Shangguan Family?

Which granddaughter of the Bai family did Old Lady Shangguan Fancy?

“Also, who was the heir of the Shangguan Family? ”

“During this period of time, there had indeed been rumors about the heir of the Shangguan family in the s galaxy, but no one knew who the real heir of the Shangguan family was. ”

“When these words were said, everyone looked at each other, stunned. Even Old Master Bai was at a loss. ”

“In the crowd, Bai Mo’s heart was beating fast. ”

Could it be that Old Lady Shangguan was here for her?

She had just met a young man with the surname Shangguan at a cocktail party a few days ago.

“Although the other party was just an ordinary waiter, Bai Mo subconsciously felt that the surname Shangguan was not simple, so she chatted with him a little more and even exchanged contact information. ”

Could it be...

It really be her?

“After all, the Bai family only had a few granddaughters of marriageable age. ” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Her, Bai Yuanyuan, and Bai Jingshu. ”

Bai Yuanyuan did not have much of a brain and looked just like that. It was impossible for her to be taken in by the heir of the Shangguan family.

“As for Bai Jingshu, it was even more impossible. After all, Bai Jingshu was already married. ”

“Then, the only possibility was because of her. ”

“The more Bai Mo thought about it, the more excited he became, and his heart beat faster and faster. ”

One beat after another.

“That was the Shangguan family. If she could marry the future heir of the Shangguan family, she would be able to wake up from her dream with a smile. ”

“Seeing Bai Mo’s strange behavior, Bai Yuanyuan gently tugged on Bai Mo’s sleeve and swallowed. “Mo Mo, could it be that the person that Old Lady Shangguan is talking about is you?” ”

“Bai Mo did not directly answer Bai Yuanyuan’s question. Instead, he answered indirectly, “I have indeed met someone surnamed Shangguan recently.” ”

“Really?”Bai Yuanyuan asked excitedly.

“Yes.”Bai Mo nodded.

“Bai Yuanyuan asked again, “Where did you meet? When did this happen? How come I don’t Know?”She was really too curious and envious. How could Bai Mo’s luck be so good that he could meet noblemen everywhere! ”

“Bai Mo lowered his voice and said, “I can’t explain the details in just a few words. Don’t worry, let’s take a look. What if Old Lady Shangguan isn’t here to find me?” ”

“”How could she not be!”Bai Yuanyuan continued, “Besides you, who else here knows Shangguan? Old Lady Shangguan already said that she’s here to give the betrothal gifts to the heir! Old Lady Shangguan must have come for you! Mo Mo, why do you think your life is so good!” ”

Bai Mo tried hard to suppress the excitement in her heart. “Let’s take a look first.”

“Old Master Bai was stunned for a moment before he continued, “I wonder which of my granddaughters caught old lady’s Eye?” ”

The guests at the side were also very excited. They wanted to know whether it was Bai Mo or Bai Yuanyuan.

Some people had even started to play the game.

“Most people chose Bai Mo. after all, compared to Bai Yuan Yuan, Bai Mo looked better. ”
