“”This is the contact information our master asked me to give you.”One of them handed Bai Mo a piece of paper and continued, “Our Master also said that if you are afraid, you can call the police.” ”

“After saying that, the two of them turned around and left. ”

Bai Mo stood where she was and looked at the contact information on the paper. She was so angry that her whole body was trembling.

She had never thought that Manwen would be so difficult to navigate.

“Fortunately, she had exchanged contact information with Manwen the last time, so she could contact Manwen on her own initiative. ”

“Thinking of this, Bai Mo immediately connected to Manwen. ”

“However, a prompt appeared on the other end of the screen, ‘you are not Manwen’s friend yet’. ”

“They had clearly added each other as friends, so how could she not be Manwen’s friend! ”

Did Manwen delete her? RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

No!

Impossible!

Manwen would never delete her for no reason.

“But now, other than Manwen deleting her, there was no other explanation. ”

“Bai Mo looked in the direction where the two of them had left, wishing that she could break her silver teeth. ”

On the other side.

“But when the first ray of sunlight shone through the window, Bai Jingshu slowly opened her eyes. ”

What entered her eyes was a very unfamiliar scene.

“The window was open, and the beige curtains fluttered in the wind. A green leaf peeked in from the window, adding to the vivid color. ”

Where was this place?

“At this moment, the sound of the door being pushed open came from behind her. ”

Bai Jingshu immediately sat up from the bed.

“”Jingshu, you’re awake.”Ye Zhuo walked in from outside. ”

Bai Jingshu was stunned. “Miss Ye?”

“Ye Zao smiled faintly. “Like I said, you don’t have to be so formal with me. Just call me by my name.” ”

“Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded. She didn’t quite understand what was going on.

Ye Zao placed the things in his hands on the table. “The land for toiletries here is brand new. The bathroom is inside. I also prepared the clothes inside for you.”

Only then did Bai Jingshu remember what happened last night.

“”Zhuo Zhuo, thank you.”Bai Jingshu looked at Ye Zhuo. ”

“You’re welcome.”

“Bai Jingshu continued, “Where’s Mr. Ye? Is He... Alright?” ”

“”He’s fine.”Ye Zhuo continued, “He’s waiting for you downstairs to eat.” ”

“Alright.”Bai Jingshu nodded. “I’ll go wash up now.”

“”Then I’ll go out first.”After saying that, ye Zao walked out and closed the door behind him. ”

Bai Jingshu took her toiletries and walked to the bathroom.

“Ye Zao had prepared a dress for her that had the elements of a traditional Chinese dress. It was very plain and elegant. Usually, Bai Jingshu would not challenge such a dress. Now that she was wearing it, she felt like a different person. ”

It was indescribably beautiful.

One had to admit that ye Zao’s judgment was really too sharp.

“After washing up and changing her clothes, Bai Jingshu went downstairs. ”

“As expected, Lin Ze was already sitting at the dining table. ”

“Mr. Lin.”

Lin Ze turned his head slightly. “Are You Alright?”

“”I’m fine.”Bai Jingshu looked at Lin Ze. “Mr. Lin, thank you for Last Night.” ”

“If Lin Ze had not arrived in time, Bai Jingshu would not have dared to imagine what would have happened. ”

“Don’t thank me yet. Sit Down and eat.”

“At this moment, ye Shu walked out from the kitchen with milk in her hands. She smiled and said, “This must be Miss Bai, right? I wonder what you like to drink. I prepared some milk, soy milk, and freshly squeezed fruit juice.” ”

“Lin Ze immediately followed behind and introduced, “This is my mother.” ”

“”Hello, Auntie.”Bai Jingshu continued, “My name is Bai Jingshu. You can call me Jingshu.” ”

“”Okay, okay, okay.”Ye Shu smiled and said, “Jingshu, quickly sit down and eat.” ”

“”Thank you, Auntie,”Bai Jingshu said. ”

It could be seen that the members of the Lin family were very hospitable.

“Ye Shu said, “Everyone who comes is a guest. Miss Bai, don’t stand on ceremony with us. Just treat this place as your home.” ”

“”Jingshu, sit down quickly.”Ye Zhuo saw that Bai Jingshu was quite restrained, so he pulled her to sit down at the dining table. ”

“Not long after, Lin Jincheng also came down from upstairs. ”

“There’s a guest at home?”Lin Jincheng asked with a smile.

“Ye Zhuo introduced, “Dad, this is Bai Jingshu. She’s a good friend of my brother and I.” ”

“”Welcome, Welcome.”Lin Jincheng continued, “I didn’t expect Ah Ze to have a female friend. This is the first time a tree of steel has blossomed!” ”

Lin Ze’s neck turned red at these words.

Bai Jingshu was also a little embarrassed.

“Lin Jincheng realized that these words were somewhat inappropriate. After all, young people nowadays were relatively thin-skinned. He continued, “Miss Bai, visitors are guests. Just treat this place as your own home.” ”

As expected of a married couple. Lin Jincheng and ye Shu’s words were exactly the same.

“”Thank you, Uncle.” ”

“Lin Jincheng smiled and said, “At home, we rely on our parents. When we go out, we rely on our friends. What’s there to thank? Hurry up and eat!” ”
