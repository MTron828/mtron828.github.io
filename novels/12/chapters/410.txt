“Ye Zao followed closely behind. “After Shen Rong’s death, did Mu Yourong ask your brother to indirectly tell you that her mother had left and her father was still in prison? Did she ask you to help Mu Yourong out on account of the past relationship between her parents?” ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “I think so.”

“”That’s right. So, Shen Rong’s death must have something to do with Mu Yourong!”Ye Zao continued. “The last time I went to the funeral home to visit Shen Rong, I discovered that she had taken sleeping pills before she died. Shen Rong did not commit suicide, so why did she take sleeping pills before she died?” ”

“”So, I’m guessing that when Mu Yourong found out that your family did not go bankrupt, she and Shen Rong had an intense argument! According to Mu Yourong’s personality, she would definitely pin the matter of breaking off the engagement on soldier Mu and Shen Rong.” ”

“Ye Zao’s tone was indifferent, but every word was deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. ”

Cen Shaoqing rubbed the chess piece between his fingers and slightly frowned.

“General!”Ye Zao directly ate Cen Shaoqing’s handsome face. “Do you want to see if Shen Rong’s death has anything to do with Mu Yourong?”

Cen Shaoqing nodded. “You have a way?”

“”Of course I do.”Ye Zao continued, “Call that good brother of yours and meet him next door to Mu Yourong’s house at 7:30 pm. When the time comes, I’ll treat all of you to a good show for free.” ”

“Do you need my help?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“No need.”Ye Zhuo waved his hand.

Ye Zhuo had checked Mu Yourong’s whereabouts. She had some matters to attend to today and was expected to return home at 7:30 pm.

It was only slightly past 10 am.

There was more than enough time.

“In the blink of an eye, it was already 7:30 pm. ”

“Because Li Qiandong was extremely uncooperative, Cen Shaoqing had no choice but to have someone trip Li Qiandong to the next room. ”

“Li Qiandong was tied to a chair. “Fifth brother, what on earth do you want to do!” ”

“”Please watch the show.”As he spoke, Cen Shaoqing turned on the monitor hanging on the wall. ”

This was a surveillance screen.

Li Qiandong immediately recognized that this was Mu Yourong’s home.

“What do you want to do to yourong! ?”Li Qiandong struggled violently.

Cen Shaoqing had someone tape his mouth shut.

“Mu Yourong dragged her heavy steps and walked in from the outside. As soon as she opened the door, she clearly felt that something was wrong. ”

The temperature in the air was very cold.

It made people shiver involuntarily.

But the air conditioner in the room was clearly switched off.

“Also, the lights in the room were also not quite right. ”

It was very dark.

And they swayed.

“Seeing Mu Yourong in the picture, Li Qiandong became even more excited. He struggled non-stop, afraid that they would hurt Mu Yourong. ”

Mu Yourong gulped and closed the door.

Shen Rong’s photo was hanging on the wall in the middle of the living room.

“In the photo, she was smiling at Mu Yourong. ”

Mu Yourong felt all the hair on her body stand up. She hurriedly turned on the television.

TSS —

“The television was turned on, but every time an image appeared, it was replaced by snowflakes. ”

What was going on?

Was the television broken?

Mu Yourong walked over and patted the television.

At this moment —

PA!

The lights in the room suddenly went out.

Only the faint light from the snowflakes on the television was left.

Why did the electricity suddenly go out?

“Mu Yourong took a few steps back, her body hitting the chair with a crisp sound. ”

“Yourong...”

“Mu Yourong...”

Two faint sounds came from afar.

Mu Yourong’s body was drenched in cold sweat.

“This, this was... ”

Shen Rong’s voice!

It was Shen Rong’s voice.

Shen Rong had come to find her!

“Mu Yourong gripped the chair behind her tightly, her face devoid of any color. ”

PA —

“At this moment, the door to the bedroom where Shen Rong had lived before she died suddenly opened by itself. ”

White fog rose up.

A white voice walked over from within the White Mist.

“Her skin was the color of paper, and there were two lines of bloody tears on her face. ”

This was Shen Rong!

It really was Shen Rong!

Mu Yourong’s legs directly trembled until they became sieves.

“”Yourong, it’s so cold underground, come down and accompany me...” ”

“When she spoke up to this point, Shen Rong’s expression suddenly became savage as she roared angrily: ”

“You’re my daughter! How could you have the heart to kill me?”

“Seeing that Shen Rong was getting closer and closer to her, Mu Yourong was so frightened that she collapsed to the ground. She cried as she stepped back. “You were poisoned by gas, it has nothing to do with me! Please don’t come looking for me! I beg you!” ”

“”It’s You! It’s You! “You put sleeping pills in the cup in advance, and then deliberately stewed soup on the stove! “You did it so that I would be poisoned by gas while I was unconscious! “Murderer, you murderer ”

“Because only when I’m dead can you blame all the mistakes and dirty water on your father and me

“”After I died, you took advantage of Li Qiandong’s trust in you and let the Cen family know that I was dead. You wanted to attract the attention and sympathy of the Cen family and bring you to the Cen family, hoping that you could renew the engagement ” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“”Unfortunately, you miscalculated! The Cen family had long seen through your ugly face!” ”

“”After your plan to seduce Cen Shaoqing failed, you schemed against Li Qiandong again! You Made Li Qiandong mistakenly think that you had sex with him! So that Li Qiandong, that idiot, would become the person who would take over the child in your stomach!” ”

“Am I right?”

It was also at this moment that Cen Shaoqing tore off the tape on Li Qiandong’s mouth.

“Li Qiandong stopped making noise and just looked at Mu Yourong in the surveillance camera. His face was deathly pale, and layers of cold sweat appeared on his forehead. ”

No!

It Won’t!

Mu Yourong wouldn’t be so vicious.

Unfortunately.

Mu Yourong didn’t refute Shen Rong’s words.

“”Yes! Everything You Said is right! That Idiot Li Qiandong is just a stepping stone for me! I’ve always been using him to get close to Cen Wuye! But I never thought that Cen Shaoqing was Cen Wuye! I regret it! If I hadn’t broken off the engagement back then, I wouldn’t have to go through so much trouble now!” ”

“”But mom, everything I’ve done is for you! For this family! Didn’t you always say that you would sacrifice everything for me?” ”

Some mothers would give their lives for their children.

Why couldn’t Shen Rong?
