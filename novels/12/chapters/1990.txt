“In less than thirty minutes, ye Zhuo had deciphered all the information. ”

“Cen Shaoqing continued to ask, “How is it?” ”

Ye Zhuo’s expression was a little complicated. “It’s from the S Galaxy.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“After saying that, she continued, “When did you discover this?” ”

“The first time was ten years ago.”Cen Shaoqing’s tone was a little heavy. “The last time was three years ago.”

“Ten years ago, Cen Shaoqing was 23 years old. ”

“Three years ago, Cen Shaoqing was 30 years old. At that time, he had just met ye Zao. ”

Ye Zao frowned slightly.

This meant that these core robots had nothing to do with her.

“”However, maybe it was even earlier. After all, these core robots are good at disguising themselves.”CEN Shaoqing continued, “Every time I find them, they immediately activate the auto-destruct mode.” ”

“On the surface, the core robots looked exactly like normal humans. ”

Whether it was the skin temperature or the accent.

“Most importantly, they had their own emotions, and they would even fall in love with humans. ”

“The first core robot that CEN Shaoqing found was a candidate who came to the CEN Group. At that time, this core robot had worked in the marketing department for a year. ”

“During this period, his colleagues, including his friends and even his lovers, did not notice his abnormality. ”

“Later, because of the excellent performance of the core robot and the fact that Cen Shaoqing had a secretary by his side. ”

So his assistant arranged for him to come over.

“Three days later, Cen Shaoqing saw the difference in him. After asking in detail, the core robot actually short-circuited and self-destructed. ”

“At this time, Cen Shaoqing began to pay attention to the abnormality of the CEN Group. ”

And smoothly investigated the other three core robots from the CEN Group.

“Ye Zhuo turned his gaze to Cen Shaoqing, his red lips slightly opening, “Do you know where these core robot men came from?” ”

Cen Shaoqing shook his head slightly.

“”The General Alliance,”ye Zhuo replied. ”

“Where is the General Alliance?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“Ye Zhuo explained, “There are a total of three countries in the s galaxy, they are changyue country, the insect race, and Manxing country. These three countries are all under the control of the General Alliance. Your Core Robot Chip came from the General Alliance!” ”

“Hearing this, Cen Shaoqing narrowed his phoenix-like eyes. A dangerous look flashed across his eyes. ”

Ye Zhuo was also somewhat puzzled.

“Earth was several million light years away from the s galaxy. Most importantly, the general alliance strictly prohibited anyone from landing on Earth in the S Galaxy. ”

“Not only that, the General Alliance also clearly stated that all life in the s galaxy could not break the natural laws on Earth. ”

Why would the General Alliance not follow the rules?

“Did these core robots do anything to hurt you?”Ye Zhuo continued to ask.

“Since the general alliance had arranged for the core robots to come, there must be a purpose! ”

The resources on Earth were not rich. What Secrets did the General Alliance have?

“”Not really,”cen shaoqing continued, “I discovered that after the first core robot entered self-destruction mode, the second one I observed for a period of time and discovered that they seemed to be transmitting information to some mysterious power.” ”

But it was a pity.

The anti-detection ability of these core robots was very strong.

“Cen Shaoqing originally wanted to observe for a period of time, but he was quickly discovered by the core robots. ”

“After these core robots discovered that they had been exposed, they immediately activated self-destruction mode. ”

Transmitting information?

Ye Zhuo narrowed his eyes slightly. What information were these core robots transmitting to the Allied countries?

What kind of message on Earth was worth the attention of the main alliance?

“After a while, ye Zao continued, “Based on what I know, the first main alliance of the main alliance is from Earth. Could it be that they are looking for something? Other than sending messages, did you notice anything else?” ”

Even though Earth’s space civilization level was not high.

“But earth had its own charm. It was the birthplace of humanity, so it contained countless treasures. ”

“For example, the plain jade. ”

Ye Zao never thought that the plain jade could become a perpetual motion machine.

“”There’s no such thing.”Cen Shaoqing shook his head slightly. “Every time I found a clue, they self-destructed.” ”

“Ye Zao continued, “This shows that they are afraid of being discovered by you. To be precise, the people in the General Alliance are afraid that you will find them.” ”

“I now suspect that the shipwreck of my father’s ship is related to these core robots.”

“All these years, he had been looking for an opportunity to tell his mother about this. ”

“But he was afraid that the greater the hope, the greater the disappointment. ”

Zhou Xiang had already experienced disappointment once.

Cen Shaoqing could not bear to see his mother experience disappointment once again.

“Moreover, discovering the core robots was not a small matter. If he was not careful, it would cause global chaos. ”
