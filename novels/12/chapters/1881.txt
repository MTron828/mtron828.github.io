Translator: 549690339

“Cen Shaoqing looked at her back and slightly raised his eyebrows. In a flash, he walked to the bathroom on the other side. ”

“Ye Zao came to the bathroom and stood in front of the sink. He washed his face with cold water and only then did he wake up a little. However, the burning sensation on his face was still there. ”

“Looking at himself in the mirror, ye Zao suddenly felt that he was quite useless. ”

“Having lived for two lifetimes, what kind of grand scene had she not seen before? ”

How could she be at a disadvantage in such a matter?

Ye Zhuo scratched her hair and left the bathroom ten minutes later.

“When she came out of the bathroom, Cen Shaoqing had not come out yet. ”

Cen Shaoqing only came out after about thirty minutes.

He held a string of Buddhist beads in his hand and walked over slowly in his plain clothes. He was like a handsome young master who had walked out of an oil painting in the Republic of China.

It was as if everything that had just happened was just an illusion.

He was 1.93 meters tall and looked a little oppressive.

“Ye Zhuo raised his head and looked at him. He raised his eyebrows slightly and said, “Don’t you look a little like that?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing curved his lips slightly. “Thank You for your compliment, Madam.” ”

“Ye Zhuo looked out of the window and continued, “When will we arrive?” ”

“”About twenty minutes more,”Cen Shaoqing answered. ”

“”Okay,”ye Zhuo continued, “The Yueyue family also has an airport. We can just park at their house.” ”

“Unlike Beijing, the grassland was vast. Even ten airports wouldn’t be a problem, let alone one. ”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Not long after, the plane arrived at the Li family’s private airport. ”

“Because there was only one plane, the Li family’s airport wasn’t as big as they had imagined. ”

“The moment the two of them got off the plane, Li Yueyue came over to greet them. “Zhuoluo!” ”

“Yueyue.”

The two young girls hugged each other.

“After a while, Li Yueyue released ye Zhuoluo and greeted Cen Shaoqing who was standing behind ye Zhuoluo. “CEN Fifth Master.” ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Li Yueyue continued, “Oh right, Great Zao, Fifth Master, let me introduce you. This is my father, and this is my mother.” ”

“Father Li was tall, about 1.8 meters tall, and his face was full of muscles. One look and you could tell that he was not someone to be trifled with. At this moment, his face was filled with smiles. “Miss Ye, Cen Fifth Master!” ”

“Unlike mother Li’s boorish behavior, mother Li was gentle and careful. With a height of 1.58 meters, standing together with Father Li, who was like a mountain, they were two extremes. ”

“Li Yueyue’s appearance inherited her mother’s gentleness, and her height inherited her father’s. ”

The two of them combined to learn from each other’s strengths and make up for each other’s weaknesses. It was incomparably perfect.

“Uncle Li. Auntie Li.”Ye Zhuo greeted politely.

“”Miss Ye, Master Wu, please get on the car.” ”

“Although the airport was not big, it was still a little far from the Li family’s big villa. To go from the airport, one had to drive. ”

“That’s right, they had to drive. ”

“The winter on the grasslands was very cold. The snow was 40-50 centimeters deep. Other means of transportation could not travel together, so they had to use sleds. ” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The ones pulling the sleds were a group of Huskies.

“The Huskies on the grasslands and the grassland wolves were close relatives. Their bodies were snow-white, and they looked mighty and domineering. ”

“Li Yueyue smiled and said, “Da Zhuolao, you and master five will take the one in front, and we’ll take the one in the back.” ”

This was ye Zao’s first time making a sleigh. He felt a little curious and worried. “Can they really pull the two of us?”

“Li yueyue nodded and said, “Don’t worry, they can definitely pull us! We often sit in them. Even if there are two of you, it won’t be a big problem, let alone the two of you.” ”

“Hearing Li Yueyue’s words, Ye Zao sat in the back seat of the sleigh with ease. ”

Li Yueyue brought a fluffy scarf to ye Zao. “The wind is strong on the prairie. Put this on first.”

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Li Yueyue continued, “Does fifth master need it?” ”

“”It’s okay. He has a special constitution and is not afraid of the cold,”ye Zao said. ”

“Okay.”Li Yueyue nodded. “Let’s go back first.”

“Okay.”

The few of them sat on the sleigh.

The Coachman raised his whip and drove the Huskies forward.

“”Distinguished guests, sit tight!” ”

“The next second, the sleigh flew out at lightning speed and skidded quickly in the snow. ”

“Ye Zhuo said in surprise, “I didn’t expect these Huskies to be so powerful.” ”

“CEN Shaoqing said, “Huskies are originally sleigh dogs. It’s just that they were fired badly two years ago, so they were treated as pet dogs.” ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Not long after, they arrived at the Li family home. ”

The Li family’s large villa was built in an imposing manner.

“Seeing that the Li family’s parents had returned, the butler immediately came out to welcome them. “Sir and Madam, you’re back.” ”

Father Li nodded. “These two are Miss Ye and CEN fifth master. Have the guest rooms been prepared?”

“”They’re all prepared. Don’t worry.”The butler continued, “Oh right, sir, Miss Shuyi is here.” ”

“Li yueyue frowned and whispered, “What is she doing here?” ”
