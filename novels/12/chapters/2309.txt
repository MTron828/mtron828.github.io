“She was sad for Old Lady Lin’s death, but also for her own work. ”

Ye Shu immediately went into the room.

“Old Lady Lin was lying on the bed with her eyes closed, as if she was asleep. Her expression was serene. ”

“Mother!”Ye Shu called out.

Old Lady Lin on the bed did not react at all.

“Grandma!”

“Lin Ze looked at Old Mrs. Lin, his eyes full of disbelief. ”

“Old Mrs. Lin had indeed done many wrong things in the past, but she was also a good grandma. ”

“Although there were mistakes, the credit was also there. ”

“No matter what, Old Mrs. Lin was the one who raised Lin Ze. ”

“In Lin Ze’s memory, there were many memories of Old Mrs. Lin. ”

“Almost in an instant, tears welled up in Lin Ze’s eyes. ”

Tears poured down like rain.

“”Grandma!”Lin Ze knelt by the bed, crying uncontrollably. ”

Ye Shu walked to Old Mrs. Lin’s side and reached out to check her breathing.

“Just as sister-in-law Wang had said, Old Mrs. Lin was no longer breathing. ”

“Facing Old Mrs. Lin like this, Ye Shu couldn’t help but cry out, “Mom! Mom, Please Wake Up!” ”

“No one had expected that Old Lady Lin, who had been talking and laughing yesterday, would become like this today. ”

The world was unpredictable.

“”Madam! Doctor Jiang is here!”At this moment, the housekeeper walked in with Doctor Jiang. ”

“Ye Shu stood up, “Doctor Jiang, I’m sorry to trouble you. Although my mom’s legs are inconvenient, her health has been pretty good these years. Please help me see what’s Going On!” ”

“Okay.”Doctor Jiang put down the medical kit and walked to the bedside to check.

“A moment later, he raised his head to look at Ye Shu. “Mrs. Lin, the old lady is already over ninety years old and has passed away. It’s normal for her to be born, grow old, get sick, and die. I’m sorry for your loss.” ”

This was the first time ye Shu had faced life and death so directly.

“Although the old lady had done many things that she hated to the bone in the past, she was no longer alive. The deceased was more important. ”

“Hearing the Doctor’s announcement, the surrounding servants began to quietly wipe away their tears. ”

The atmosphere became sorrowful.

“Not long after, Lin Jincheng rushed back. ”

“Ah Shu! What happened to Mother?”

Ye Shu looked at Lin Jincheng. “Mother has already left. Doctor Jiang said that she will die at the end of her life...”

Lin Jincheng’s eyes also turned red in an instant.

“”Mr. Lin, I’m sorry for your loss,”doctor Jiang continued, “The old madam passed away in peace.” ”

People in their nineties were also celebrating and mourning according to the customs of the capital.

“Lin Jincheng turned his head to look at Old Lady Lin who was lying on the bed. His expression was a little sorrowful, but there was not much sadness. ”

“The ups and downs in his life, the separation of his family and his wife, including the loss of a leg, were all the work of Old Lady Lin. ”

Some wounds could not be forgotten just like that.

“If it were not for ye Zao’s intervention later, he and ye Shu might not have seen each other again in this lifetime. ”

“Although he was Old Lady Lin’s biological son, he still had some hatred for her. ”

“However, she had already left. No matter how great the hatred was, it should be let go. ”

“Old Lady Lin’s legs were already inconvenient. Now that she had passed away, it was also a relief for her. ”

“Lin Jincheng quickly calmed down. He turned to look at ye Shu and said, “I’ll go and inform eldest brother, third brother, and fourth brother. Ah Shu, you follow the housekeeper to take care of the rest of the matters.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Shu nodded.

Lin Jincheng quickly informed the four brothers of the Lin family.

“Other than Lin Qingxuan, the other three brothers were in the east, south, and west directions. Even if they took a plane, it would take them two to three hours to get here. ”

“After hearing this news, everyone was very shocked. No one expected that Old Lady Lin would suddenly pass away. ”

The four brothers of the Lin family immediately rushed back with their families.

The first one to return was Lin Qingxuan. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Why is mom gone just like that? Wasn’t she very energetic yesterday?”Lin Qingxuan asked.

“Like everyone else, Lin Qingxuan was also very surprised. ”

The first thing that came to his mind was Old Lady Lin Yesterday.

“Yesterday, Old Lady Lin had told him that she would bring little Lin Zhi abroad to play during the New Year. ”

Why was it today...

Lin Jincheng sighed. “Doctor Jiang said that he would die of old age.”

“Lin Qingxuan was the same as Lin Jincheng. His feelings for Old Lady Lin were especially complicated. Back then, Old Lady Lin had forced him to marry Zhao shuning. After Zhao shuning left, she had stopped him from being with Xia Xiaoman, even though she had realized it in time, but Old Lady Lin had indeed delayed him for more than half of his life. ”

“But now that she had left, as the son of a man, he should put on mourning clothes for his mother and send her off. ”
