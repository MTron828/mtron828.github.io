Translator: 549690339

“”Zao Zao?”Lin Qingxuan raised his head to look at Ye Zao, his eyes full of surprise. “What, what are you talking about?” ”

He didn’t expect ye Zao to suddenly appear.

He also didn’t expect ye Zao to suddenly say such a thing.

Lin Jincheng was also a little confused.

He didn’t realize what was going on.

Wasn’t Zhao shuning always the one who was infertile? Why did ye Zao say that Lin Qingxuan was the one who took the blame for Zhao Shuning?

Could there be something else going on?

“Ye Zao enunciated each word carefully. “Fourth uncle, the one who is infertile is Zhao shuning. This matter has nothing to do with you.” ”

Lin Qingxuan looked at ye Zao with disbelief in her eyes. Her mind went blank and she took a few steps back.

Ye Zao said that the person who was infertile was Zhao Shuning?

How was that possible?

They had clearly gone to the hospital for a checkup.

They had gone to the hospital for a full three times.

The results were the same three times!

It couldn’t be.

Why would Zhao shuning lie to him?

“Lin Jincheng frowned. “Zao Zao, what exactly happened? Tell me clearly.” ”

“Ye Zao looked at Lin Jincheng, “Dad, it’s like this. “Twenty-one years ago, after Zhao Shuning married fourth uncle, she went to the hospital for a checkup because she was infertile for a long time. In the end, she was found to be infertile because of Gong Han. She was afraid that fourth uncle would divorce her because of infertility, so she bribed the doctor and blamed fourth uncle for being infertile.” ”

“”All these years, although Zhao shuning has always announced to the public that she was infertile, in the mainland, fourth uncle always thought that he was the one who was infertile. Because he felt guilty towards Zhao shuning, fourth uncle tolerated her a lot.” ”

“Actually, when Cen Shaoqing told ye Zhuo about this, Ye Zhuo was also very surprised. ”

She had always known that Zhao shuning was infertile.

“However, she did not expect that Zhao shuning would actually turn the infertile into Lin Qingxuan. ”

This made Lin Qingxuan live in guilt towards her.

It was also because of this that Lin Qingxuan was so afraid of her.

“However, from another point of view, it could be seen that Lin Qingxuan was a rare and good man. ”

It had been twenty-one years.

“However, if Lin Qingxuan had a second heart and was raising someone outside, this matter could not be hidden anymore. ”

“Similarly, this was also what Zhao Shuning was most worried about. That was why Zhao shuning was so sensitive and did not even allow Lin Qingxuan to speak to the opposite sex. ”

“This was because once Lin Qingxuan had an affair, it was very likely that the entire illegitimate child would be born. ”

“At that time, the news of her infertility would also be made public. ”

“Lin Jincheng was stunned. It took him a long time to react. He turned to look at Lin Qingxuan, his eyes full of disbelief. “Fourth brother, is that so?” ”

How could he have thought that a matter of infertility could involve so many things.

If that was really the case...

Then Zhao Shuning was too scary.

She actually forced her own mistake on Lin Qingxuan and lied to her for so many years.

“Lin Qingxuan’s face was expressionless, “Actually, burning was wrong. I was the one who was infertile. It was shuning who took the blame for me... This matter had nothing to do with Shuning. I let shuning down. I didn’t give her a child...” ”

“At the end of her sentence, Lin Qingxuan’s eyes turned red. ”

Lin Qingxuan trusted Zhao shuning very much.

Why would Zhao shuning lie to her?

It wouldn’t happen!

“Although Zhao Shuning was flawed in other areas, it couldn’t be denied that she was a good woman. If she wasn’t a good woman, she wouldn’t have taken his place ”

“As a woman, who wouldn’t want to have a child? ”

Lin Qingxuan could understand why Zhao shuning had become like this. He felt sorry for her efforts over the years. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Because he understood, he tolerated her in every way possible. ”

Ye Zhuo frowned slightly.

It seemed that this fourth uncle of hers was really an infatuated person.

“At a time like this, he still firmly believed in Zhao shuning. ”

It was a pity.

Zhao shuning simply did not deserve this deep affection.

“If Zhao Shuning was a good woman, even if she did not give birth and lived a good life with Lin Qingxuan, Lin Qingxuan would not have done anything like a divorce. ”

“Ye Zhuo looked up at Lin Qingxuan, “Fourth uncle, you’re really not the one who’s infertile! You’ve been taking the blame for Zhao shuning all this time! Facts speak louder than words. If you don’t believe me, you can go to the hospital to have a checkup without Zhao shuning knowing. The Doctor will tell you the exact answer!” ”

“Hearing this, Lin Qingxuan took a few steps back. ”

“Lin Jincheng promptly supported Lin Qingxuan. “Fourth brother, I’ll go with you tomorrow! When the time comes, just say that you’ll go to the hospital with me for a checkup!” ”

Lin Qingxuan didn’t say anything.

It took a while for him to recover.

“Ye Zhuo looked up at Lin Jincheng. “Dad, this is how it happened. Please advise fourth uncle well. I’ll go back to my room first.”It wasn’t appropriate for a junior like her to stay here on such an occasion. ”
