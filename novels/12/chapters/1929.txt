Did they really think that he was easy to bully?

“Li Sanzhu raised his head to look at Li Erzhu and his wife, “Who exactly did mom die because of? If it wasn’t for Li Shuyi doing something shameful, would mom have used the medicine to threaten me? Mom was killed because of you!” ”

“Linda said, “Li Sanzhu, do you still have a conscience? Mom is already dead! In front of her, you actually framed our Shuyi! who exactly did mom die because of?” ”

“After saying that, Linda rushed to old Mrs. Li’s body and burst into tears, “Mom, Mom, Please Open Your Eyes and help us! You just left, and Li Sanzhu is bullying us like this! Didn’t he just bully me and Erzhu without a son? Unfortunately, our Shuyi is a girl. If our Shuyi were a boy, she wouldn’t be bullied like this! Mom, Please Wake Up!” ”

The operating theater was in chaos.

“There were even many people standing outside the operating theater, watching the commotion and whispering to each other. ”

“Li Yueyue pinched her temples and listened to Linda’s unreasonable pestering. She couldn’t help but feel angry from the bottom of her heart. “Enough! All of you, shut up!” ”

“Li Yueyue had never lost her temper before. At this moment, her sudden outburst successfully shocked everyone. The ward instantly became quiet and everyone looked at Li Yueyue. ”

Li Yueyue looked at them like that. “Grandma has already left. Can’t you guys be a little quieter? Do you have to make a fool out of yourselves? Do you guys think it’s honorable to let everyone know about Li Shuyi’s trivial matter?”

Don’t you know that you can’t Reveal Your Dirty Laundry?

“When they heard this, Li Erzhu and Linda were stunned. ” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The two of them looked at each other. Neither of them said anything.

Indeed.

Li Yueyue was quite right.

“What Li Shuyi had done was very disgraceful. If everyone knew about it, they would be the ones who would lose face. ”

“Li Sanzhu looked at Li Yueyue and suddenly felt that his precious daughter had grown up. “Yinyue, go to the hospital to go through the procedures. We’ll bring her home first.” ”

Fang yinyue nodded.

“According to the rules of the prairie, after the death of an elder, they had to stay at home for three days. After the relatives and friends paid their respects, they would send her to the top of the mountain for a celestial burial. ”

Yes.

“There was no cremation or burial on the grassland, only a heaven’s burial. ”

“Although a heaven’s burial was somewhat unacceptable, it was still a rule left behind by the ancestors, and their descendants could only follow it. ”

“The procedures went smoothly. After the procedures were completed, Fang yinyue informed the butler to set up a mourning hall at home. ”

“Li Sanzhu was, after all, a big shot on the grassland. The funeral could not be too simple, and he had to invite famous archmages. ”

“That afternoon, many people came to pay their respects. ”

“Other than family and friends, there were more people who had business dealings with Li Sanzhu. ”

At night.

The family sat at a table and ate.

“Li Erzhu looked at Li Sanzhu, he said calmly, “Sanzhu, MOM has already left. No matter what, he left because of the matter with Shuyi. Shuyi is also your biological niece. Before mom died, all she thought about was Shuyi. If you don’t Save Shuyi, then Shuyi’s life will be ruined!” ”

“If he couldn’t do it the hard way, then Li Erzhu could only do it the soft way. ”

He hoped that the family love token could work on Li Sanzhu.

“Hearing this, Linda immediately nodded and echoed, “His third uncle, Shuyi has always respected you. She doesn’t care about the monk’s face, but the Buddha’s face. Shuyi is the only child between your second brother and me. I beg you to help her!” ”

“After saying this, Linda turned to look at Li Yueyue, with a sobbing voice, she said, “Yueyue, I know that you have never liked your cousin very much. Treating you as your cousin is really treating you as a younger sister. Yueyue, now that your cousin is in trouble, as a younger sister, you can’t just stand by and do nothing!” ”

Li Yueyue couldn’t respond to this.

“Li Sanzhu put down his chopsticks, “Second sister-in-law, don’t make things difficult for Yueyue.”. Although Yueyue had some friendship with Miss Ye, it was not enough to make Miss Ye and fifth master Cen change their minds. “It’s not that we don’t want to help you, it’s that we really can’t do anything!” ”

“”Sanzhu, I know you guys have a way,”Linda continued, “You...” ”

“Li Sanzhu interrupted Linda, “Second sister-in-law, that’s it. Mom has already left. I don’t want to argue with you guys in front of Mom’s Memorial Hall.” ”

“According to the rules of the grassland, after the people left, the descendants had to eat three meals a day in front of the funeral hall. Not only that, but they also had to leave a place for the undead. ”

Until the funeral.

“Hearing this, Linda didn’t say anything more. ”
