Translator: 549690339

“Hearing this, ye Zao almost choked to death. ”

He choked until his face turned red.

Cen Shaoqing’s heart ached. He immediately stood up and patted her back. “Eat Slowly.”

“Then, he gave ye Zao a cup of warm water. “Drink some water.” ”

Ye Zao took the cup and drank more than half of the water. Only then did he feel better.

“Seeing her like this, Yi Ling asked in puzzlement, “Am I wrong? If boyfriends aren’t the ones who give birth together, then who is?” ”

Cen Shaoqing raised his eyes slightly. “You’re not wrong.”

“Yi Ling said, “Since I’m not wrong, why would big Zao do that?” ”

“”She’s thin-skinned,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“”OH.”Yi Ling nodded, half understanding, and then said, “By the way, are you a human?” ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Yes.”

“Upon hearing this, Yi Ling looked at Cen Shaoqing very seriously and continued, “I don’t think you’re an ordinary human! An excellent gene like yours should be passed down more often. Remember to have more children with big searing...” ”

“To prevent Yi Ling from talking nonsense, ye searing reached out to grab Yi Ling and continued, “Doggie, haven’t you always been clamoring to eat the delicious food on earth? Come, these are all of them!” ”

“Seeing the delicious food, Yi Ling’s eyes immediately lit up. She transformed into a Shredder and opened her mouth so wide that it was bigger than a plate. One mouthful could fit three large chicken drumsticks, as she ate, she said incoherently, “So substandard! So substandard! So substandard! I love Earth! I love China!” ”

“Ye Han swallowed his throat. To be honest, if he had not seen it with his own eyes, he would never have believed that Yi Ling’s mouth was so big. ”

Amazing!

“One Man and one bird. In less than an hour, they finished a table full of dishes. ”

“In the end, Yi Ling’s stomach directly became more than twice its usual size. She slumped on the table and didn’t move at all. ”

“Looking at ye Zao again, not only did he not feel full, he even ordered a plate of fruits after dinner. ”

Ye Han even suspected that there was a shredder in ye Zao’s stomach!

“After eating and resting for a while, Cen Shaoqing drove ye Zao back. ”

“Because he had told them beforehand, Ye Shu, Lin Jincheng, and Lin Ze were all waiting at home. ”

“When they got home, they realized that Ye Sen was also there. ”

“Zao Zao is back!”

“Zao Zao!”

“”Dad, Mom, uncle, and brother!”Ye Zao walked over and gave the four of them a big hug. ”

“Lin Jincheng sized ye Zao up and down, his eyes slightly red. “You’ve lost weight, you’ve lost weight!” ”

“Although it had only been a month since they last met, Lin Jincheng felt as if they were separated by a century. ”

“When ye Zao had left home, he had still been wearing a sweater in the capital. Now, even wearing a short-sleeved shirt felt hot. ”

“Moreover, ye Zao had clearly said that he would be back in half a month, and it had already been a month. ”

“”You’ve indeed lost weight,”ye Sen said. “Eldest niece, the food in your base isn’t good! Especially for technical personnel like you, how can you not keep up with the nutrition!” ”

“Seeing this scene, Ye Han’s eyes turned slightly red. ”

No Wonder Ye Zao had always wanted to return to Earth.

If it were him...

He would also be reluctant to part with these cute family members.

“At this moment, ye Zao continued, “Father, mother, uncle, brother, I’ll introduce you to someone.” ”

“After saying that, ye Zao pulled ye Han to his side. “This is our new member, Ye Han. Ye Han, this is father, this is mother, this is brother, and this is uncle.” ”

“Regarding ye Han’s matter, Ye Zhuo had video-recorded it with his family. Otherwise, Ye Sen would not have come all the way back. ”

He had come back to welcome ye Han.

“Ye Han had originally thought that he would be very uncomfortable facing ye Zhuo’s family on Earth for the first time, but he had not expected that he would adapt very quickly. That feeling was very strange, as if, in the unseen world.., he had long been a family member. “Father, mother, brother, Uncle.” ”

“”Good, good!”Lin Jincheng held ye Han’s hand. “Child, this is a little gift from us. Please accept it.” ”

“And uncle’s.”

“This is brother’s.”

“However, in the blink of an eye, three big red packets were stuffed into ye Han’s hands. ”

Ye Han was a little confused. He turned his head to look at Ye Zao.

“In the Chang Yue Country, Ye Han had never experienced such a thing. ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Father, mother, uncle, and brother gave you a greeting gift. Just accept it! This is our custom here.” ” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Hearing what ye Zhuo said, Ye Han accepted them one by one and bowed to everyone. “Thank you, father, mother, thank you, uncle, thank you, Brother.” ”

“”You’re welcome.”Ye Sen smiled and said, “Second nephew, from now on, we are a family. There’s no need to say thank you between families.” ”
