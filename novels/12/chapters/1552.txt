What a joke!

She had gone crazy from looking at Tang Mi!

Dong Dong Dong —

“At this moment, Tang Xue reached out and knocked on the table. ”

“Only then did Tang Xue React. When she saw Tang Xue, she put down the instrument in her hand. “Sis.” ”

“”So you still remember this sister of mine,”Tang Xue said sarcastically. ”

“Tang mi continued, “I’ll get you some water.” ”

“”There’s no need for water.”Tang Xue looked at Tang Mi, then she said, “Uncle and aunt should have already told you, right? While you can still stop now, hurry up and leave ye Zao’s aircraft carrier project team. “You’re not young anymore this year. Why Can’t you think about your uncle and aunt? Let those two old people worry behind you!” ”

“If the aircraft carrier project failed, the members of this project team would be blacklisted by the scientific research community! At that time, they would no longer be able to participate in any scientific research experiments. ”

“Tang Mi was still young this year. If she developed well in the scientific research community, her future would definitely not be too bad. If she followed ye Zhuo, she would only ruin her future ”

“Hearing this, Tang mi frowned and looked up at Tang Xue. “SIS, since I’ve chosen to believe in Miss Ye, then... Then I won’t quit at this time!” ”

“Regardless of whether ye Zao could create an aircraft carrier or not, she had no regrets. ”

“In life, one had to go crazy! ”

“Tang Mi had always been a well-behaved girl. Even during her rebellious adolescence, she had always followed her parents’arrangements step by step. But this time, she did not want to continue like this! ”

“As a researcher, she had to live for the sake of research and live for herself. ”

“”I didn’t realize that you were so loyal!”Tang Xue mocked, “It’s just that your hot-blooded and full of trust isn’t worth mentioning in ye Zao’s eyes. Who knows, he might just be toying with you! If I wasn’t your sister, I wouldn’t have bothered with your stupid matters!” ”

“”Miss Ye isn’t the kind of person you’re talking about!”Hearing Tang Xue Slander ye Zao, Tang Mi was a little angry, “I believe in Miss Ye, and I believe in Big C district even more! The two-year pact hasn’t arrived yet. How can you be so sure that Miss Ye’s aircraft carrier plan will definitely fail?” ”

“Having followed ye Zao for so long, Tang Mi knew ye Zao’s character very well. ”

Ye Zao was very protective of her own shortcomings.

He was very outstanding!

Only by following behind ye Zao could she find her own worth.

“In fact, before entering the aircraft carrier project team, Tang Mi was a very unconfident person. She had always felt that Tang Xue was better than her... ”

It was ye Zao who told her that everyone was an independent individual. Everyone had their own strengths and specialties. Ye Zao also told her to insist on being herself.

Only by being herself was she the most outstanding!

“Therefore, in Tang Mi’s heart, Ye Zhuo was not just a leader. ”

She was an idol and also a believer!

“Tang Xue snorted coldly, then she said, “I think you’re crazy about wanting to be famous! Isn’t it good to be down-to-earth at such a young age? Do you have to dream of reaching the sky in one day! I know you want to surpass me and defeat me, but I’ve earned my position today by relying on my own strength! What About You? Do you have the strength? If it weren’t for me, you wouldn’t even have the qualifications to enter this base! Tang Mi, I’m telling you, you better wake up!” ”

“Tang mi bit her lip, her eyes slightly red. In a moment, she raised her head to look at Tang Xue, she mustered up her courage and said, “Tang Xue! Don’t flatter yourself! If I really relied on you to enter the base, I wouldn’t have to take the test three times! I came in on my own strength! It has nothing to do with you!”When Tang Xue said this in the past.., she had never dared to fight back, but it was different now. In order to increase her confidence, ye Zhuo had specially brought Tang Mi to look up the test papers from that year. ”

Tang Mi’s admission had nothing to do with Tang Xue.

Tang Xue frowned tightly and looked at Tang Mi in disbelief. She couldn’t believe that this was true.

“Tang Mi had always been meek in front of her. She said one thing, and Tang Mi never dared to say another. But now... ! ... why did she seem like a different person! ”

Was this still the Tang Mi she knew? RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“”Based on your strength! Tang Mi! You really have the nerve to say this!”Tang Xue was so angry that she laughed. “Based on your talent, not to mention taking the test three times, even if you take the test ten times or a hundred times, you won’t be accepted by the base!” ”

“”You clearly think too highly of yourself! You’re so powerful, if you have the ability, get your cousin in as well!” ”

“Tang Xue’s cousin, Su Yan, had always wanted to enter the CEN group’s base, but her aptitude was really too poor. Tang Xue looked for many ways, but she was unable to get Su Yan in. ”
