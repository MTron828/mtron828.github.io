“”Your health is not good, so I specially brought some nutrients.”Zhou Xiang put the things on the table and looked up at Zhou Zuolong. “Dad.”.”

Zhou Zuolong ignored Zhou Xiang.

“Xie wanqiu smiled and said, “Old Man, my daughter is calling you!””

“She still thinks I’m her father?”Zhou Zuolong looked at Xie wanqiu with a mocking expression.

“Zhou Xiang said, “Father, you will always be my father.””

Zhou Zuolong snorted coldly.

“Zhou xiang continued, “Father, I was too impulsive before. I apologize to you. Please don’t take it to heart.””

She had admitted her mistake.

Zhou Xiang had actually admitted her mistake so quickly.

“Zheng Wanyin stood at the side, a mocking expression flashing in her eyes.”

She had thought that Zhou Xiang would go all the way this time.

She did not expect Zhou Xiang to still be so weak.

“When she heard that Zhou Zuolong was going to break up with her, she was shocked.”

He was really stupid.

“Zhou Zuolong looked at the obedient Zhou Xiang and the anger on his face disappeared a little. “Let me ask you, when Will Shaoqing break up with Ye Zhuo?””

“”Dad, can they not break up?”Zhou Xiang asked.”

“What did you say? Tell me again!”Zhou Zuolong glared at him.

“Zhou Xiang gulped. Although he was a little scared.., but he still braced himself and said, “Dad, I beg you to help those two children. It was really not easy for them to get to where they are today. Wanyin is so outstanding. She will definitely find someone better.””

“Evil daughter! Are you trying to anger me to death!”Zhou Zuolong raised his hand and was about to hit Zhou Xiang.

“Xie wanqiu blocked in front of Zhou Xiang. “Old Man, you can’t hit me anymore!””

“Xie wanqiu begged Zhou Zuolong as she said to Zhou xiang, “Xiang Xiang, quickly give in to your father! Don’t you know your father’s temper? If you anger him, he will really sever ties with you!””

Zhou Xiang did not know what to do either.

On one side was her son.

On the other side was her father.

“”Xiang Xiang! Quickly agree to your father!”Xie wanqiu continued, “Otherwise, I can’t help you! Do you really want to sever your relationship with your father? You have to think carefully, you only have one Father Now!””

Xie Wanqiu’s words directly pinched Zhou Xiang’s weakness.

Yes.

She only had Zhou Zuolong as her father. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Could it be that the relationship between the father and daughter really had to come to the point of breaking off?

“Zhou Xiang had no choice. At the moment, she could only use a delaying tactic to wait for Zhou Zuolong to calm down.”

“In short, she could not really break off her relationship with Zhou Zuolong.”

“”Father, I Promise You!”Zhou Xiang raised her head to look at Zhou Zuolong and continued, “Let Shaoqing break up with Zhuozhu.””

Zheng Wanyin’s eyes lit up when she heard that.

She agreed!

Zhou Xiang finally agreed.

She thought Zhou Xiang would resist Zhou Zuolong to the end.

She did not expect Zhou Xiang to bow down so quickly.

“Then, she could become CEN Shaoqing’s girlfriend in the future.”

Zheng Wanyin had never dreamed of that position.

“But one day, when she really got that position, she could not help but be excited.”

“Once she married Cen Shaoqing, she would become the CEN family’s mistress.”

“From now on, the Cen family would be her world.”

“Not to mention the CEN family, even the entire capital would be in her hands.”

“Xie wanqiu narrowed her eyes. She knew that this little b * tch, Zhou Xiang, would not be able to escape from her grasp.”

“After tormenting for so long, didn’t Cen Shaoqing still want to break up with Ye Zhuo?”

“Xie wanqiu smiled and said, “Yes, yes. Old Man, Xiangxiang has agreed! I told you, Xiangxiang is a good and obedient child. She will definitely listen to us!””

“At least Zhou Xiang had some discerning eyes. Zhou Zuolong retracted his hand and continued, “Then when do you plan to let Shaoqing and Yinyin be together?””

“Zhou Xiang thought for a moment and raised his head to look at Zhou Zuolong, then, she said, “You can’t force things when it comes to love. You have to take things slowly and let these two children adapt to each other. You know Shaoqing’s character. If you force it, it will backfire.”Zhou Xiang did not really want Cen Shaoqing to break up with Ye Zhuo, everything she did was just a delaying tactic.”

“As a daughter, she could not just watch her father cut off relations with her.”

“Hearing this, a dark light flashed in Xie Wanqiu’s eyes.”

What did Zhou Xiang Mean?

Not letting Cen Shaoqing break up with Ye Zhuo?

“If she didn’t ask for a breakup, how would Zheng Wanyin rise to power?”

Could it be that Zhou Xiang wanted to trick them?

“Zhou zuolong continued, “Then how do you plan to let them adapt to each other?””

“”Or, or,”Zhou Xiang hesitated for a moment before continuing, “Why don’t we let Wanyin stay in the manor first?””
