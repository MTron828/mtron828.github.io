“Li hang continued, “Please Sit Down First and let me tell you slowly.” ”

“Okay.”Li Da long nodded.

The father and daughter went to the study room and sat down.

“Li hang deliberated over his words and continued, “Dad, I’ve thought about it for a long time, but in the end, I still feel that I have to tell you the truth.” ”

“I want to be with my mother.”

“Hearing this, Li Da Long was stunned for a moment before asking, “Why?” ”

“”I just want to be with my mother,”Li Hang said. ”

“Li Da long instantly found a problem with himself. “Is it because dad remarried? If it’s because of this reason, dad can immediately break up with your Aunt Fan!” ”

“For his daughter, Li Da Long would do anything. ”

“”Dad, it’s not because of this reason,”li hang continued, “I just feel that my mother is too pitiful alone. She has worked hard for this family for so many years. I don’t want her to have nothing in the end.” ”

“Li Hang’s words were dignified. If people who did not know heard it, they would really think that Li Hang was a filial daughter. ”

“She was not a filial person. At the same time, she was not the kind of child who was unforgivable. ”

“At least, before she left, she found a suitable woman for Li Da Long to live with. ”

“For the rest of his life, Li Da Long was at least not alone. ”

“”If you think your mother is very pitiful, then don’t you think your father is very pitiful?”Li Da Long did not understand why li hang would change so much in such a short period of time. ” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“”Tell father, what exactly happened? Or did your mother say something to you? Or did father do something wrong? That led to your decision!” ”

“Li Da Long looked at Li Hang, eager to know the answer. ”

“As long as Li Hang could point out the problem, he would definitely change it. ”

“Li hang looked at Li da long and said sincerely, “Dad, I just want to stay with mom. I Can’t bear to part with you. I beg you not to make things difficult for me.” ”

“Li da long continued, “Hang Hang, do you know that you are dad’s Fate!” ”

“Li hang said very calmly, “Then have you ever thought that I am also my mother’s fate?” ”

One sentence made Li da long speechless.

“For children, their parents’divorce did indeed leave them with no choice. ”

“He was Li Hang’s father, and he saw Li hang as his entire life. However, Zhou Cui Hua was Li Hang’s mother, and she also saw Li hang as her entire life. ”

“Li hang continued, “Dad, do you know how hard it is for a woman to be pregnant for ten months? I don’t want to see my mom’s disappointed eyes... Mom needs me, and I need her.” ”

“But dad and this family also need you.”

“”Dad, you already have aunt fan,”Li Hang said. ”

“Li Dalong said, “Hang, if it’s because of your aunt fan, I can break up with her immediately. I’ll call her right now and tell her.” ”

“After saying that, Li da long took out his phone and was about to call fan Juan. ”

“”Dad, it really has nothing to do with Aunt Fan.”Li hang directly took the phone from Li Da Long’s hand. ”

“Then what’s the reason?”Li Da Long asked.

“”Because my mother is my mother,”Li Hang said. ”

“Li da long continued, “I don’t agree with you following your mother!” ”

“As a father, Li Da Long would never allow Li Hang to live a life of exile with Zhou Cui Hua. ”

Zhou Cui Hua had nothing now. What could she give Li Hang?

“Why?”Li Hang asked.

“Li da long continued, “I know your mother too well. If you follow her, she will only become a burden to you.” ”

“She won’t!”Li Hang said.

“”Hang Hang, you don’t know your mother at all!”Li da long continued, “In short, I absolutely won’t allow you to follow her!” ”

“In Li Da Long’s eyes, Li Hang was still a child. She couldn’t tell right from wrong. ”

“At the same time, Li Da Long didn’t want to see Li Hang Regret. ”

“”Dad, I beg you.” ”

“No means No.”Li Da Long’s attitude was very firm.

“Dad!”

Li Da long ignored Li Hang and turned to leave.

“Looking at Li Da Long’s back, Li hang frowned tightly. ”

What should he do now?

“Li Da Long’s heart was restless. Unknowingly, he drove the car to fan Juan’s apartment. ”

Li Da Long took out his phone and dialed fan Juan’s number.

“Fan Juan happened to be resting at home today, so she answered the phone very quickly. ”

“Hello.”

“Li dalong continued, “Juan ‘er, I’m downstairs at Your House.” ”

“”I’ll be right down,”fan Juan said. ”

“Soon, Fan Juan went downstairs. ”

“Why are you here?”Fan Juan looked at Li Dalong and asked.
