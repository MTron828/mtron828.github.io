“The more Li Qiandong thought about it, the more excited he became. ”

“He did not expect Cen Shaoqing to have an ice-cold expression on his face. He did not care about Mu Yourong at all. In fact, he still attached great importance to Mu Yourong. Otherwise, with his personality, he would definitely not have attended the banquet! ”

“Therefore, Cen Shaoqing definitely decided to attend the banquet for Mu Yourong’s sake! ”

“After leaving the Cen Group, Li Qiandong personally invited mu yourong to attend the banquet. ”

“Upon receiving Li Qiandong’s invitation, Mu Yourong was extremely excited. ”

CEN fifth master was definitely present at the banquet organized by Li Qiandong.

“This time, she definitely had to recover all of the face she had lost at the Miao Yin annual gala. ”

“After all, the cloud capital was her world! ”

She had to make Fifth Master Cen Fall Madly in love with her and marry her!

Mu Yourong looked at herself in the mirror and the corners of her lips curled up in a determined smile.

“After contacting Mu Yourong, Li Qiandong went to contact ye Zao again. ”

“He did not have ye Zao’s wechat, so he could only contact ye Zao on the International Technology website. [ is the God Here? ] ”

[ what’s the matter? ] Ye Zao happened to be online doing a mission.

“[ I have a private party, and I want to invite the God to attend! ] ”

Ye Zao hesitated for a moment. She was not very interested in a party or anything like that.

“Seeing that ye Zao did not reply, Li Qiandong took out his trump card. [ God, I have also invited a Michelin three-star dessert master to make desserts on the spot! ] ”

“At the venue of the last wonderful sound anniversary party, Li Qiandong discovered that ye Zao loved to eat desserts. ”

“That was because that night, she ate more than ten pieces of desserts by herself! ”

Li Qiandong was stunned by what he saw.

It must be known that most girls who loved to look beautiful would avoid desserts in order to maintain their figure. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Other than insensible children, ye Zao was probably the only one who dared to eat like that. ”

“Sure enough, after seeing this sentence, Ye Zao, who was a little hesitant, immediately operated the keyboard to reply: [ send me the time and place. ] ”

Three-star Michelin dessert master.

It must be very good!

“Ye Zao narrowed his eyes, as if he could already see Carrie, Chocolate Mousse, frost, and nut brownie waving at him. ”

“Seeing ye Zao’s reply, Li Qiandong heaved a sigh of relief and hurriedly sent the time and place. ”

“The venue of the party was a member-made hotel in yunjing, and the time was six o’clock on Saturday night. ”

“Tomorrow was Wednesday, and Ye Zhuo still had to go to school. ”

“As the college entrance examination approached, the atmosphere in the class became more and more tense. Everyone’s desks were piled high with study materials, the most conspicuous of which was the “Three-year college entrance examination five-year simulation.”. ”

On the blackboard at the back was the countdown to the college entrance examination.

Thirty-eight days.

“As the time for the college entrance examination approached, the voting posts on the forums became more and more popular. ”

“Currently, there were more than 3,000 people supporting Mu Yourong. ”

“And only a little over 1,000 people supported ye Zao. ”

No one believed that ye Zao could obtain any outstanding results in the college entrance exam.

“North Bridge’s number one handsome: [ if ye Zao can surpass Mu Yourong in the college entrance exam, I’ll eat my phone live! ] ”

“Sily Su Nuannian: [ What’s eating a phone? There’s no way to plagiarize in the college entrance exam. I think she won’t even be able to get 100 points! If she can surpass mu yourong, I’ll eat SH * t Live! ] ”

“An ugly person with a poor heart could not be happy: [ God of the top leaf! Our God of the leaf did not plagiarize, and she also disdains plagiarism! ] ”

Little Mood Triste: [ I just saw ye Zhuo’s previous results in teacher Qian’s office. The total score of the six subjects is only 52 points! Those people in the ordinary class are all brain-dead fans. They have been completely brainwashed by Ye Zhuo. ]

Young and frivolous people do not know that the winner is King I: [ who still doesn’t have a past? Can’t our god of the leaf work hard? ]

“I can cry, but I will never admit defeat I: [ total score 52, can you work hard to become the first in the grade? If working hard was that simple, then there wouldn’t be any bad students in our school! So be it if you plagiarize, but you still don’t dare to admit it. If you plagiarize a dog, your whole family will die. If you help plagiarize a dog, your whole family will die too! ] ”

“”Zhuozhuo, do you think there’s something wrong with these people? Can’t they stop? He’s the one who plagiarized! His whole family plagiarized! Shameless Lemon Sprite!” ”

Zhao Pingting held her phone in her hands. She was so angry that her face turned red.

“”I’m going to take screenshots of these people eating SH * t and eating their phones. When the results of the college entrance exam are out, I’ll post them and let them eat SH * t!” ”

“As Zhao Pingting spoke, she took screenshots and saved them all on her phone. ”

“Ye Zao’s expression was indifferent, as if she was not the main character of the incident. “Those who are innocent will be innocent. Anyway, the college entrance exam is coming soon. When that time comes, these rumors will naturally fall apart!” ”
