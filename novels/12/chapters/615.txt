“Chapter 616: 147: publicly flaunting their love, envying others, and revealing the truth! 2”

Translator: 549690339

“At the thought that Cen Shaoqing might be a domestic bully, Lin Ze’s face darkened. ”

“Seeing Lin Ze’s face darken bit by bit, Cen Shaoqing’s heart skipped a beat. ”

“With his future brother-in-law like this, did he still remember what happened when he was young? ”

“If he remembered correctly, Lin Ze was only three years old at that time... ”

“Brother?”Lin Ze did not say anything until ye Zhuo reminded him.

“Only then did Lin ze come to his senses and did not embarrass him in front of Cen Shaoqing. He nodded and said, “Hello.” ”

“Ye Zhuo continued to introduce him to Cen Shaoqing. “This is eldest cousin brother’s eldest cousin sister-in-law, second cousin Brother’s second cousin sister-in-law, third cousin Brother’s third cousin sister-in-law, fourth cousin Brother’s fourth cousin sister-in-law, fifth cousin Brother’s fifth cousin sister-in-law, sixth cousin Brother’s sixth cousin sister-in-law, seventh cousin Brother’s seventh cousin sister-in-law, eighth cousin Brother’s eighth cousin sister-in-law, ninth cousin Brother’s ninth cousin sister-in-law, and tenth cousin brother.” ”

“Tenth Cousin Brother was a single dog, so there was no tenth cousin sister-in-law for the time being. ”

“The eldest cousin brother of the Lin family was only 31 years old this year, and the others were all several years younger than Cen Shaoqing. ”

But Cen Shaoqing still had to follow behind and call him Big Brother.

Who asked him to be a junior!

“Perhaps, even Cen Shaoqing himself did not think that he would have such a day. ”

It had always been others who called him grandfather.

When had he ever called others ‘elder brother’?

“Moreover, it was a group of elder brothers who were younger than him by more than ten years. ”

“There were ten cousins and nine elder sisters-in-law, a total of nineteen people. Including the Lin family’s cousins, there were some similarities between their eyes and brows. Cen Shaoqing was dazzled by the number of people he recognized. ”

“Being called elder brother by Cen Shaoqing, the pressure on the ten elder brothers-in-law was also great. ”

The nine elder sisters-in-law had even more dumbfounded expressions.

“In the circle of the aristocratic wives, Cen Wuye would often be mentioned. ”

“After all, Cen Wuye was a figure standing at the top of the pyramid. ”

He was an existence that could control the sky in the capital.

Whoever married Cen Wuye would be an undisputed existence in the circle of the aristocratic wives. Who would not be able to look at Cen Wuye’s face?

Who would not want to introduce a girl of marriageable age in their family to Cen Wuye?

What a pity.

CEN fifth master’s heart was set on Buddha and he was a non-marriageist. No one would take a fancy to him.

None of the nine sisters-in-law had expected that the youngest sister in the family had actually conquered CEN fifth master.

This was too amazing.

“Moreover, judging from the way these two people interacted, it seemed that Cen Shaoqing had to look at ye Zhuo’s expression everywhere? ”

Ye Zhuo introduced five little fellows to Cen Shaoqing again.

“”These are my five little nephews, Duan Duan, Dong Dong, Nuo Nuo, Yang Yang, Rui Rui Rui. Duan, Dong Dong, Nuo Nuo, Yang Yang, Rui Rui, this is your uncle Cen.” ”

“”Hello, Uncle Cen.” ”

The five little fellows greeted him politely.

“Cen Shaoqing bowed slightly and greeted the five little fellows, “Duan Duan, Dong Dong, Nuo Nuo, Yang Yang, Rui Rui, Hello.” ”

“Duan Duan stood in front and said warily, “Are you trying to snatch our aunt?” ”

“The children were nave and innocent. They would speak their minds if they had something to say, but they did not know how to hide it. ”

“In their eyes, anyone who tried to snatch their aunt was a bad person. ”

“If Cen Shaoqing dared to snatch their aunt, they would chase him out! ”

“Cen Shaoqing’s expression did not change. He patted Duan Duan Duan’s little head with the hand that was holding the Buddha Pearl, “Don’t worry, I’m not here to snatch your aunt away from you. I’m here to join your big family with your aunt. In the future, besides your aunt, wouldn’t it be good to have another person who likes you?” ”

Ye Zhuo secretly praised Cen Shaoqing’s Eq.

Duan Duan tilted his head and thought for a moment. “It seems... it’s not bad...”

“After saying that, Duan Duan said again, “Then will you buy US Good Food?” ”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Then will you buy US Good Food?”

Cen Shaoqing nodded again.

The Lin family’s eldest cousin looked at his fearless son and his heart broke out in cold sweat.

This brat’s guts were really too big! He actually dared to stretch out his hand to ask CEN fifth master for something!

“Duan Duan acted like a little adult, he continued, “Just buying things for us isn’t enough. You’re not allowed to bully our aunt! If you dare to bully our aunt, the five of us brothers will not let you off! Moreover, our aunt still has, still has...” ”

“Speaking up to this point, Duan Duan counted with his fingers,”... has eleven older brothers! If you dare to bully her, my father and my uncles will smash your head to the side!” ”

“Duan Duan waved his fist, “I’m asking if you’re afraid!” ” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“”Of course I’m afraid!”CEN shaoqing nodded slightly, “Duan Duan, don’t worry. I’ll always protect your aunt. I Won’t bully her at any time.” ”

“Really?”Duan Duan asked.

“A gentleman’s word...”
