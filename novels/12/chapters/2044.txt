Translator: 549690339

There was a few seconds of silence in the air.

Shangguan Jue did not say anything.

“Sixth Elder walked forward and said, “Elder Bai, in a while during the election, we will announce another piece of news. At that time, we will naturally explain to everyone why Miss Ye was absent from the election.” ”

Another piece of news?

“Bai changhu nodded. “Alright, then I’ll wait for this explanation. Goodbye.” ”

“After saying that, Bai changhu turned around and left. ”

Bai changhu returned to his seat.

“Liu zhengting said impatiently, “How is it? What did Shangguan Jue tell you just now?” ”

“Bai changhu said, “They said that Miss Ye will not appear tonight. Apart from the election, they will announce another piece of news.” ”

“Another piece of news?”Yu Zhenfei narrowed his eyes. “What’s the other piece of News?”

Bai changhu shook his head. “But the glory sect said that this piece of news will explain to everyone why Miss Ye will be absent from the general election.”

“Liu zhengting continued, “Then let’s wait for the eight great clans to give us an explanation! I’d like to see what kind of explanation they can give!” ”

“At this moment, another commotion came from the entrance. ”

The few of them turned their heads to look.

They saw a middle-aged woman with an aura of jewels and a myriad of manners walking in.

There were two bodyguards behind the woman.

“”Isn’t that Manxing country’s first lady, Zhao Dan?”Yu Zhenfei recognized the noble woman who was walking in with a glance. ”

“Why is Zhao Dan Here?”Someone asked from the side.

“Yu zhenfei continued, “At this juncture, he must be here to attend the ceremony.” ”

Bai changhu narrowed his eyes. “It seems that this election is a foregone conclusion!”

“Otherwise, the first lady of the Manxing Kingdom wouldn’t have come to attend the ceremony. ”

“”I don’t understand. What is so special about this autumn flute?”Liu Zhengting frowned slightly, “Three hundred years ago, a prophet predicted that there must not be a ruler with the surname Qiu in Changyue. Otherwise, the country will be destroyed. What are the eight families thinking?” ”

Yu Zhenfei sighed and didn’t say anything.

Time passed very quickly.

The Countdown to the general election was about to begin.

“After the host said a few words, the chief chief, Shangguan Jue, came up to the stage and spoke. ”

“Shangguan Jue stood at the head of the rostrum with his hands on the rostrum. He looked at the people below the rostrum and slowly said, “First of all, thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to participate in our changyue country’s general election.” ”

“As soon as he finished speaking, there was a warm applause below the rostrum. ”

“”Next, I would like to introduce a few distinguished guests. First of all, the representative from Manxing country, Ms. Zhao Dan!” ”

“Zhao Dan stood up and smiled at everyone. “Good morning, everyone. I’m Zhao Dan. It’s a pleasure to meet you all here. It’s also an honor to meet you all.” ”

“After saying this, Zhao Dan sat down. ”

“After the applause, Shangguan jue continued, “Next is the secretary-general of the General Alliance, Mr. Lin Zheng.” ”

“Lin Zheng was the secretary-general of the General Alliance. He was 45 years old this year, and his hair was a little gray. Looking at him like this, he looked very kind. ”

“After introducing the distinguished guests, Shangguan Jue looked at the audience below the stage, he said, “Next, it’s the segment we are looking forward to the most, and the main character of tonight. She is the next female monarch of Changyue. Let’s welcome Miss Qiu Di!” ”

It was very awkward.

“This time, not only did the audience not clap, but everyone was talking about it. ”

“In changyue, there was a general election held every three years. ”

A monarch who gained the people’s approval could continue to be elected.

“If they did not gain the people’s approval, they could only vote for a reelection. ”

This was the first time everyone had seen someone like this who directly announced the next female monarch.

What was this?

“The next female monarch! Why is it the next female monarch! Miss ye is our eternal female monarch!”

“Who’s Qiu Di?” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Where’s Miss Ye?”

“Why would she suddenly change female monarchs? Don’t try to trick us with the retirement tactic. We won’t believe it until we hear Miss ye announce her retirement!”

Someone stood up from his seat. “We only admire miss ye! Let Miss Ye come out!”

“Right! Let Miss Ye come out! We want to see Miss Ye.”

“Qiu Di, who was wearing a phoenix robe and standing backstage, frowned deeply when she heard this. ”

A group of unruly people!

How Long had Ye Zhuo been dead? They were still thinking about ye Zhuo!

Just wait.

“After she took office, she would make all of these people pay the price! ”

“Everyone’s reaction was within the Great Patriarch’s expectations. After all, Ye Zhuo’s influence on the Chang Yue kingdom was not just for show. ”
