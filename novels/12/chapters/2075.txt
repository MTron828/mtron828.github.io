“From the moment the servant pushed open the door, Cen Shaoqing sensed that something was wrong ”

The servant was also speechless. He had only been undercover in the CEN family for one day.

“Zhou Xiang and old Mrs. Cen downstairs did not discover anything, but Cen Shaoqing also discovered it! ”

As expected.

Cen Shaoqing was Cen Shaoqing.

“Cen Shaoqing stepped on the servant’s back and tried hard to calm himself down. “Fifth Master, you misunderstood. I, I was not sent by anyone.” ”

“You’re not going to say it?”Cen Shaoqing increased the strength of his foot.

The servant’s face instantly turned pale.

“”I, I’ll say... I’ll say anything...” ”

Cen Shaoqing did not reduce the strength of his foot.

“”Yes, yes...”before the servant could finish his sentence, his vision went black and he fainted. ”

“The next second, Cen Shaoqing’s foot was empty. The person who was originally alive suddenly disappeared without a trace, leaving only a chip on the ground. ”

Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly and picked up the chip on the ground.

S galaxy.

The alliance.

What was their purpose?

“Cen Shaoqing put away the chip and went to the bathroom to take a shower. When he came out of the bathroom again, he had already changed into his usual long gown. ”

“His temperament was refined, and his thin lips, which were pursed into a line, looked a little cold. ”

Cen Shaoqing came to the study and inserted the chip into the USB.

“At this moment, Old Mrs. Cen’s voice came from outside the door, “Five, Shaoqing!” ”

“”Grandma,”Cen Shaoqing answered. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen pressed on the door handle and found that it could not be opened. She said somewhat speechlessly, “It’s broad daylight, and leaf is not here. Why did you lock the door?” ”

It was like taking off his pants and farting. It was unnecessary.

Cen Shaoqing operated the computer to open the door.

“The next second, the door was opened. ”

Old Mrs. Cen walked in from outside. “What are you doing? Why aren’t you going down to eat?”

“”I’m not hungry,”Cen Shaoqing said concisely. ”

“”Not hungry? Are you going to become an immortal?”Old Mrs. Cen said in disdain, “You don’t have much meat on you to begin with. If you don’t eat, be careful that Yezi doesn’t divorce you.” ”

Cen Shaoqing touched his nose and didn’t say anything.

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Oh right, why haven’t I seen Yezi in the past few days?” ”

“”She’s busy,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“Have you contacted her?”Old Mrs. Cen asked.

Cen Shaoqing shook his head slightly.

“Ever since ye Zao left, he had started counting with his fingers to see when ye Zao would return. ”

“In the blink of an eye, more than twenty days had passed. There was no news from the s galaxy at all. Although Cen Shaoqing looked calm and collected, he still ate vegetarian and prayed to Buddha every day. He also worked out on time, but in reality, he had already become an ant on a hot pan. ”

“If ye Zhuo still did not come back, he could only venture into the s galaxy alone. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen said, “Aren’t you afraid that Ye Zi will meet someone better than you? “However, Ye Zi is not the kind of person who leaves you three or four years ago. Even if ye Zi really dumped you, it would definitely be your problem! “Who asked you to not cherish a girlfriend as good as Ye Zi!” ”

“At this point, old Mrs. Cen looked at Cen Shaoqing with disdain. “Look at your dumb face!” ”

Cen Shaoqing was like this.

“Other than in front of ye Zhuo, otherwise, he would not speak if he could. It was as if saying one more word was a waste of his life. ” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “When Will Yezi come back?” ”

“It should be in these few days.”Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips opened slightly as he twirled the Buddhist beads.

“Old Mrs. Cen said, “Which days are these next few days? Is there no definite letter?” ”

Cen Shaoqing shook his head slightly.

“”Forget it, forget it. I Can’t be bothered to ask you.”Old Mrs. Cen turned around and walked downstairs. “Remember to come downstairs to eat.” ”

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Grandma, you guys eat first. I still have something to do.” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen couldn’t be bothered with Cen Shaoqing anymore. She turned around and walked downstairs. As she walked, Old Mrs. Cen seemed to have suddenly thought of something and continued, “Oh right. Did Little Wang come up to call you just now? where is he?” ”

“”He went downstairs,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen rubbed her head and said in puzzlement, “Did he go downstairs? Why didn’t I See Him?” ”

“However, although she was puzzled, she didn’t think too much about it. ”

“After Old Mrs. Cen left, Cen Shaoqing continued to study the chip. ”

It was not until three o’clock in the afternoon that Cen Shaoqing came downstairs.

“When the housekeeper saw him go downstairs, he immediately arranged for the kitchen to cook. ”

“Actually, it was easy to cook for Cen Shaoqing. He just needed to cut two pieces of green leafy vegetables and mix them with a salad. ”

“Unfortunately, Cen Shaoqing had high requirements. He had to eat vegetables that were in season and he had to eat vegetables that had just been picked from the fields. Therefore, behind the Cen Manor, there was a huge farm. Other than some fruit trees on the farm, there were all kinds of vegetables that were in season. ”
