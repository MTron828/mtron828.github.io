Chapter 1182: 254: her face was pale. She actually lost to someone she had never taken a fancy to! 4

Translator: 549690339

It was very obvious.

It was ye Zhuo who used tricks to coax the real Qian Zhuo into willingly giving up her identity to her.

“By letting her use the name Qian Zhuo, she would be in the limelight outside! ” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

It had to be said that ye Zhuo was indeed the nemesis of men.

Yang Wenhao was a good example.

“Yang Wenhao had clearly never interacted with ye Zao before, but he always spoke up for ye Zao. ”

“Not to mention, Qian Zhuo had even interacted with ye Zao up close. ”

“If Yang Wenhao was Qian Zhuo, Yang Wenhao would willingly give his achievements to ye Zao. ”

“To put it nicely, this kind of person had a low eq. ”

“To put it bluntly, he licked dogs. ”

“Under normal circumstances, licking the dog would not end well! ”

“Thinking of this, the lawyer continued, “Shallow drink is ye Zhuo’s admirer, so she will naturally respond to ye Zhuo’s requests!” ”

“Is that really the case?”Zhao Xueyin raised her head to look at the lawyer.

“The lawyer nodded. “It must be the case! Otherwise, with just ye Zhuo alone, would she be able to design a national seal for Country P?” ”

It was impossible!

“Maybe.”Zhao Xueyin sighed. “Does she really have the ability? I can’t deny someone else’s ability just because I don’t have the ability!”

“Si Lui’s eyes flashed with disgust. “If ye Zao really had the ability, she wouldn’t be attracting bees and butterflies outside!” ”

It would be more appropriate to say that Zhao Xueyin could design a national seal.

Ye Zao?

“Other than seducing men and relying on men to get to the top, what else could ye Zao Do? ”

Even he was almost fooled by Ye Zao and had an opinion about Zhao Xueyin!

“Fortunately, he woke up in time. ”

“After saying this, si lui added, “Xueyin, have you forgotten about Jiang Xiaoyu? Jiang Xiaoyu was your best friend in the past!”Ye Zao didn’t just please men, but also women. ”

“After hearing this, Zhao Xueyin felt much better. ”

Si lui was right.

The real Shizu must be someone else.

Ye Zao was a shameless imposter!

Just wait.

She must find a chance to let ye Zao show his true colors in front of everyone!

“She must return the humiliation she suffered today to ye Zao ten times, a hundred times, a thousand times, and ten thousand times! ”

“Although that was what she thought in her heart, Zhao Xueyin did not show it on her face. She continued with a kind and understanding look, “Even though Xiao Yu betrayed me, I Don’t blame her! A good bird chooses its habitat, let alone a human.” ”

“”Xueyin,”the lawyer said somewhat helplessly, “You’re just too kind!” ”

“If it were not for Zhao Xueyin being too kind, things would not have developed to this stage. ”

Zhao Xueyin looked out of the car window. “Xiaoyu is my best friend after all!”

“”But Jiang Xiaoyu doesn’t treat you as her best friend at all.”Si lui continued, “Xueyin, in order to survive in this society, you have to learn to be harder-hearted. A person like Jiang Xiaoyu doesn’t deserve to be your friend at all!” ”

“”Big Brother Si, don’t say that!”Zhao xueyin sighed and continued, “Things have already developed to this point. What can I change by being harder-hearted? I’ve also thought it through. Shunxi Financial Group, let’s give it to Ye Zhuo!” ”

Give it to ye Zao?

On what basis?

Si Lui didn’t agree with Zhao Xueyin’s words.

“After all, Shunxi Financial Group was originally Zhao Xueyin’s. ”

“”Xueyin, at this time, you mustn’t admit defeat.”Si lui continued, “People like ye Zao who have no strength at all and only know how to rely on men will one day reveal their ugly side! “You’re different. You have strength! “No matter when or where, you can be an existence that lights up a region!” ”

Fake is fake after all.

Only Real Gold is not afraid of fire.

“People Like Ye Zao, one day when her looks are gone, will those men still care about her? ”

“Once those men leave her, then ye Zao will be nothing! ”

But Zhao Xueyin is different.

Zhao Xueyin had real talent.

She was not afraid of any test.

“”Big Brother Si, you’re wrong! If ye Zao didn’t have some strength, would she be able to achieve what she did today?”Zhao Xueyin continued, “Even though ye Zao is relying on men! But a reliable man is also a kind of strength! Unlike me, who can’t even pass the test for a man!” ”

“”That’s because you’re disdainful!”Si lui said, “Relying on a man can only depend on you for a while, but can you still rely on him for a Lifetime?” ”

“If Zhao Xueyin was willing to rely on a man to get to the top, things wouldn’t be like this now! ”

“Zhao Xueyin was pure and innocent, she didn’t want to do such a thing at all. ”

“Then.., si lui continued, “Xueyin, your wish is to put the Shunxi Financial Group on the right track and restore the glory of more than 30 years ago! If you really give the Shunxi Financial Group to Ye Zao, then the Financial Group will come to an end! Are you going to watch as the Xizhi Consortium is going to perish?” ”
