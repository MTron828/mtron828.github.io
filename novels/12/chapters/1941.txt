Cen Yuying nodded. “It’s been thirteen years.”

“Ever since that incident, Cen Shaoqing had never touched the zither again. ”

“Listening to the zither music coming from upstairs, the three sisters felt a lot. ”

Cen Shaoqing loved ye Zhuo more than they had imagined.

“Half an hour later, ye Zhuo finished boiling a pot of tea and brought eight cups to Cen Shaoqing. “Thank you for your hard work, master. have some tea.” ”

Cen Shaoqing picked up a cup of tea and took a sip.

“How is it?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“The taste is slightly bitter but sweet. The fragrance is fragrant and refreshing.”Cen Shaoqing picked up the cup again and took another sip. “Good tea! The tea maker’s craftsmanship is even better!”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Really?” ”

“Try it yourself?”Cen Shaoqing said.

“Ye Zao put the tray on the coffee table, picked up a cup of tea, and tasted it. Then he said, “Well, not bad. I didn’t lose my craftsmanship.” ”

“After a moment, ye Zao put down the cup and said, “Cen Shaoqing, since the sun is nice today and I’m in a good mood, let’s do another hypnosis.” ”

Ye Zao wanted to clear up the chaotic memories in his mind as soon as possible.

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and stood up. “I’ll go to the hypnosis tool.”

“Okay.”

“Before long, Cen Shaoqing came back with a box. ”

All the hypnosis tools were in the box.

“Cen Shaoqing lit up the incense. Soon, the room was filled with a fragrant smell. ”

Ye Zhuo also slowly fell asleep.

...

On the other side.

Today was the first day of the New Year. He ziteng wanted to bring Xu Yao back to pay new year’s greetings and let his parents meet Xu Yao at the same time.

“His relationship with Xu Yao was now very stable. More importantly, they had done what they should and shouldn’t have done. They should have brought Xu Yao back to meet their parents a long time ago! ”

Wasn’t there a saying?

An ugly daughter-in-law always had to meet her in-laws.

“Moreover, Xu Yao was not ugly! ”

“Although his parents had previously said that they would absolutely not accept Xu Yao, he ziteng believed that if he really brought Xu Yao back, his parents would definitely fall in love with Xu Yao when they saw how obedient and sensible she was. ”

“While they were having lunch, he ziteng opened his mouth to speak. ” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“”Father and mother, I want to discuss something with you.” ”

“Mother he put down her chopsticks and continued, “Speak.” ”

“He ziteng continued, “I’ve got a girlfriend and I want to bring her back for you to see.” ”

“”This is a good thing!”Father he smiled and said, “There’s no need to discuss. Just bring her back directly.” ”

“As parents, didn’t they want their children to become successful and have a family? ”

Mother he rolled her eyes at father he and turned to look at He ziteng. “How is the woman? Where does she come from?”

“Knowing that his parents had a thing for Xu Yao, he ziteng did not directly mention Xu Yao. He smiled and said, “Father and mother, don’t worry. She will definitely not let you down!” ”

“Which family’s Girl?”Mother he continued to ask.

“”Which family’s girl temporarily keeps it a secret!”He ziteng smiled and said, “Mom, don’t tell me that you still have opinions about family status?” ”

He did not have opinions about family status.

Mother he was just afraid that he ziteng would be deceived.

“As the saying goes, the marriage takes care of three generations. ”

She had to figure out the situation of the girl’s family.

“”Okay, when do you plan to bring it back?”Mother he continued to ask. ”

“He ziteng said, “We’ll go out to watch a movie in the afternoon. Why Don’t you bring her back for dinner tonight?” ”

“Hearing this, mother he frowned slightly and continued, “Who brings their girlfriend back on the first night of the first month?” ”

“”If you can’t bring her back at night, when can you?”He ziteng asked. ”

“”Why don’t we do it tomorrow morning, or the fourth day of the first month in the morning.”Good things came in pairs. Now that it was the first month of the first month, the wealthy families still attached more importance to this. Usually, it didn’t matter. ”

The first month usually gave a good omen.

“He ziteng continued, “How About Tomorrow Morning?” ”

Mother he nodded and turned to look at father he. “Are you free tomorrow morning?”

“Father he smiled and said, “It’s the first month of the Lunar New Year now. I’m not busy.” ”

“”That’s good.”After a pause, mother he continued, “Ziteng, there’s something I want to make clear to you in advance.” ”

“”Go Ahead,”he ziteng said. ”

“Mother he said, “It’s okay to bring your girlfriend back, but don’t bring those random people back.” ”

“”I know, I know.”He ziteng nodded. “Don’t worry, mother! I definitely won’t bring those random people back.” ”

Mother he didn’t say anything else.

“After dinner, he ziteng went to the Xu family’s house to pick up Xu Yao to watch a movie. ”

“When he ziteng first came to the Xu family’s house, he was quite nervous. Now that he had visited so many times, he was not nervous at all. After all, he had met the parents before! ”

“Moreover, the Xu family’s parents were very warm to him. They were even closer to him than their own son! ”

“”Uncle, Auntie, is Yaoyao Alright?” ”

“Father Xu hurriedly brought a cup of tea for he ziteng. “She’ll be done soon. Little He, wait a little longer.” ”

“The words fell, turned to look at mother Xu, “You go to urge, don’t let little he wait anxiously!” ”
