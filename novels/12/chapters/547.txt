Lin Qingxuan put down the iron in his hand and knelt in front of the bed.

“All these years, because of his guilt towards Zhao shuning. ”

He never retaliated against Zhao shuning’s beating and scolding.

“After all, he was the one who made Zhao shuning lose the right to be a mother. ”

He was the one who let Zhao shuning down.

“Zhao shuning pointed at Lin Qingxuan. “Let me ask you, did you hook up with that Vixen ye Shu?” ”

“”No, shuning. You’ve been with me for so many years. Don’t you know what kind of person I am?”Lin Qingxuan kneeled on the ground and explained weakly, “Nothing happened between me and my fifth sister-in-law. Nothing Ever Happened!” ”

“Then why do you care so much that I said ye Shu was a Vixen!”

“Lin Qingxuan sighed. “I just feel that we’re all family, and it’s not good for you to talk like that.” ”

“Zhao shuning was so angry that his face turned pale, “I’m willing to say that Ye Shu is a vixen! She’s a Vixen! Shameless! Lin Qingxuan, let me ask you, are you tired of me? ! You Want to divorce me? Let me tell you, there’s no way you can divorce me! You’ve delayed me for so many years! If it weren’t for you, I would have had both my children by now!” ”

“But it’s because of you! I’ve been mocked as a hen who can’t lay eggs!”

“Lin Qingxuan! It’s clearly you who can’t do it! You Don’t have the ability! I’ve been the scapegoat for you for so many years! Do you even have a conscience? !”

Zhao shuning had long felt that something was wrong with Lin Qingxuan.

The way he looked at Lin Ze and ye Zao was not right. His eyes were filled with envy!

Didn’t Ye Shu just give birth to a pair of twins?

What was so great about it? VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“”Let me tell you, if you can do it, don’t even talk about a pair of twins! I can give birth to even two pairs of twins! Do you think that Vixen ye Shu will give birth?” ”

Zhao shuning could not contain his anger and every sentence was harsh.

“Faced with Zhao Shuning’s accusation, Lin Qingxuan did not refute at all. She could only say in a pale voice, “Shuning, I know that you are a good woman. Don’t worry, I have never thought of divorcing you!” ”

“Zhao shuning was still not satisfied. Because of his heated words, his facial features became ferocious. “Then let me ask you, is Ye Shu a Vixen?” ”

Lin Qingxuan did not say anything.

He could not answer this question.

He could not bring ye Shu along for no reason just to please Zhao shuning.

“Seeing that Lin Qingxuan did not say anything, Zhao shuning became even angrier. He felt that Lin Qingxuan definitely had unspeakable intentions towards ye Shu. “Lin Qingxuan, let me ask you, are you feeling guilty?” ”

“No.”

Zhao shuning glared at him. “Then why don’t you dare to say that Ye Shu is a Vixen?”

“Lin Qingxuan looked up at Zhao shuning. “Shuning, you’re too extreme. Fifth sister-in-law isn’t that kind of person.” ”

Slap

“Zhao shuning gave Lin Qingxuan a slap. “I want you to say that Ye Shu is a vixen! Otherwise, we’re not done!” ”

Lin Qingxuan’s face immediately swelled up with a palm print.

Lin Qingxuan’s eyes didn’t show much surprise.

“All these years, he had received quite a few slaps from Zhao shuning. He had long gotten used to it. ”

“”Are you going to say it or not!”Before Lin Qingxuan could react, Zhao shuning slapped her again. ”

Lin Qingxuan smiled bitterly.

Great.

“This time, it was finally symmetrical. ”

“”Lin Qingxuan, are you going to say it or not?” ”

Lin Qingxuan had been silent the whole time. Zhao shuning broke down. Tears surged up and he wailed loudly.

No one knew how much she loved Lin Qingxuan.

She was afraid of losing Lin Qingxuan.

“When Lin Qingxuan treated her well and unconditionally tolerated her, she thought about how she would break down if Lin Qingxuan left her one day! ”

She couldn’t.

She couldn’t let anyone take Lin Qingxuan away.

No one could!

“Ye Shu, that Vixen, she could never take Lin Qingxuan away. ”

Lin Qingxuan wasn’t afraid of anything.

“He wasn’t afraid of Zhao Shuning slapping him, nor was he afraid of Zhao shuning scolding him. He was only afraid of Zhao shuning crying in front of him. ”

He once read a sentence.

A good man shouldn’t let the woman he loved cry for him.

“”Shuning, don’t Be Like This!”Lin Qingxuan walked over and hugged Zhao shuning. “I’ll say it! I’ll say it, Alright?” ”

“Hearing this, Zhao shuning raised his head and looked at Lin Qingxuan. “Then quickly say that Ye Shu is a Vixen!” ”

“Lin Qingxuan took a deep breath and apologized to Ye Shu in her heart as she said, “Ye Shu... is a vixen.” ”

“Hearing this, Zhao Shuning was satisfied. ”

Ye Shu wanted to fight with her?

No Way!

She was not Feng Qianhua who could hand over her man!

...

East Wing.

It was already 11 o’clock at night.

The lights in a room on the third floor were still on.
