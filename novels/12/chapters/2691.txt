Bai Jingshu was also speechless.

“She had thought that Zhou Ziyue was an innocent girl, but who would have thought that Lin Ze’s words would come true. ”

Bai Jingshu lowered her head and replied: [ I didn’t expect it either. ]

“Ma Lu put away her phone and looked at Zhou Ziyue. She continued, “Does this mean that you can accept all of my requests?” ”

“Yes.”Zhou Ziyue nodded.

“Ma Lu continued, “Alright, that’s all for now. I still have a date.” ”

“After saying that, Ma Lu picked up the briefcase on the side and turned to look at Bai Jingshu. “Then I’ll be leaving first.” ”

“Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded.

“Ma Lu turned around and walked out. Just as she reached the door, she saw a beautiful woman with a sexy figure dressed in cool clothes. “Brother Ma.” ”

“When the beautiful woman saw Ma Lu, she immediately walked over and hugged Ma Lu’s arm. ”

She couldn’t wait to get close to Ma Lu.

“Seeing this scene, Zhou Ziyue frowned. ”

Ugly people really cause trouble.

“Ma Lu was so ugly, and there was even a shameless woman who was willing to get close to her. ” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“”Ziyue, don’t be angry,”Bai Jingshu continued, “Ma Lu is just playing with those people. It’s not serious. Don’t mind her.” ”

“Zhou Ziyue nodded. “I understand. Jingshu, don’t worry. I’m not the kind of person who is petty.” ”

“Bai Jingshu looked at Zhou Ziyue and continued, “It’s good that you understand.” ”

“After saying that, Bai Jingshu added, “I forgot to ask you guys to add me on wechat.” ”

“Zhou ziyue said, “It’s fine. Just push my business card to him.” ”

“Okay.”

Bai Jingshu nodded.

“Bai Jingshu’s emotions were very complicated right now, then she said, “Ziyue, you saw what happened just now. If you marry Ma Lu in the future, he might not change much. What Ma Lu needs is a wife who keeps to herself.” ”

“”I understand.”Zhou Ziyue nodded, “Actually, I have never been a society of looks, and I don’t care about the family background of the man. As long as I like him, it’s fine. The first time I saw Ma Lu, I felt as if I had met her before. So, I’m willing to accept everything about him.” ”

Bai Jingshu looked at Zhou Ziyue. She had never known that a person could speak against his conscience to such an extent.

“Then would you mind if he has someone else outside?”Bai Jingshu asked.

“”I don’t mind.”Zhou ziyue said, “And I believe that he will change because of me.” ”

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “I wish you the best.” ”

“Thank you.”

Bai Jingshu stood up from her chair. “Then let’s go first.”

“Okay.”

Zhou Ziyue followed Bai Jingshu’s footsteps.

The two of them walked out of the cafe one after the other.

“When they returned home, ye Sui asked, “How was it?” ”

“”I guess it was successful.”Zhou Ziyue’s feelings were very complicated. She continued, “But I’m a little unwilling.” ”

“What’s there to be unwilling about?”Ye Sui asked.

“Zhou Ziyue recalled the scene when she met Ma Lu and continued, “Mom, you didn’t see how ugly that Ma Lu was.” ”

“”So what if she’s ugly? As long as she has money, isn’t that enough?”Ye Sui continued, “Feng Yang is so handsome. Can he let you live the life of a rich lady?” ”

Zhou ziyue bit her lip. “But Lin Ze is also very handsome!”

Why could Bai Jingshu marry a handsome man?

But she had to marry someone who was so ugly!

“”But Bai Jingshu is also good-looking,”ye Sui asked, “Do you think you’re half as good-looking as Bai Jingshu?” ”

Bai Jingshu was simply a beauty among beauties.

“Although Zhou Ziyue was also good-looking, she was only an ordinary person compared to Bai Jingshu. ”

“”Although I’m not as good-looking as Bai Jingshu, I’m not an ugly woman!” ”

“Ye Sui laughed. “Luckily you’re not an ugly woman. If you were an ugly woman, would ma Lu still fall for You?” ”

“Zhou ziyue continued, “Mom, do you know what Ma Lu told me?” ”

“She felt that in front of Ma Lu, she was just a lowly ant. ”

“What did she say?”Ye Sui asked.

Zhou Ziyue told ye Sui what Ma Lu told her.

“Ye Sui said in surprise, “What did you say? How much pocket money does he give you in a month?” ”

“”Six figures,”Zhou Ziyue said. ”

“Ye Sui counted with his fingers, “Then it’s 100,000, or a few hundred thousand?” ”

“Yes.”Zhou Ziyue nodded.

“Ye Sui exclaimed, “Rich people are rich people. Just a random pocket money is the money that ordinary people earn in their lifetime. “Damn girl, I’m telling you, you have to hold Ma Lu well. After this, there won’t be this shop anymore!” ”

“Zhou ziyue frowned, “I’ve told you so much, but you only heard six figures of pocket money?” ”

“Is there anything else?”Ye Sui asked.

“Zhou ziyue continued, “What he means is, if he raises women outside, I can’t care about it...” ”

“”That’s nothing,”ye Sui continued, “Who among the rich doesn’t raise women outside? Lin Jincheng and ye Shu seem to be very loving, but maybe he has raised several women outside!” ”

Zhou Ziyue was silent for a moment and didn’t know what to say.

“Ye Sui continued, “This Bai Jingshu has finally done something human.” ”

What kind of things did she introduce to Zhou Ziyue earlier!

“Zhou Ziyue looked at ye Sui, “You didn’t see that Ma Lu today. He looks much more disgusting than in the photo! It’s also strange. Logically speaking, the genes of the rich should be good, but why is Ma Lu So Ugly?” ”

“”Look at what you’re saying,”ye Sui continued, “If she’s handsome, she might not like you.” ”

“Zhou Ziyue felt that her pride had been hit. “Mom, am I as bad as you say?” ”

“”If you think I’m wrong, you can look in the mirror,”ye Sui said bluntly. ”

Zhou Ziyue was furious.

“Ye Sui continued, “Feng Yang can only be with you because he can’t find a girlfriend. As long as he has some money, he won’t take a fancy to you. Ziyue, you should be happy now! Don’t be ungrateful!” ”

Ye Sui felt that Zhou Ziyue didn’t know herself well enough.

“As a mother, she also wanted Zhou Ziyue to find a good family. ”

But Zhou Ziyue’s conditions were right there.

“She wanted to find a tall, rich, and handsome man? ”

Difficult!

“Zhou ziyue said, “You weren’t at the scene today, so you don’t understand the situation at all.” ”

“As long as she thought of Ma Lu’s face, Zhou Ziyue couldn’t stand it. ”

“Ye Sui looked at Zhou Ziyue, “Ma Lu is at least the same age as you. How many young and beautiful girls have married men who are several rounds older than them for money! “The Ma family is a big family. Even if it’s for the sake of your brother, you should still marry him! “Libang is the only boy in our family, and also the only hope for our family. Are you going to just watch Libang do nothing?” ”

“As long as Zhou Ziyue could successfully marry into the Ma family, she would not have to live on ye Shu’s face in the future. ”

“Now, the dowry of an ordinary family in Yunjing was 580,000 yuan. ”

“If Zhou Ziyue married Ma Lu, it would not be too much to ask for a dowry of 10 million yuan, right? ”

She would also need a villa and two cars.

Ye Sui had already planned everything in his heart.

“Hearing this, Zhou Ziyue felt very uncomfortable. “Why should I think for Libang! For Libang, do I have to sacrifice my own happiness?” ”

“Because you are his sister!”Ye Sui said.

“”Sister?”For the first time, Zhou Ziyue felt that her mother was so biased. “Sister has to sacrifice her own happiness for Brother?” ”

“”Zhou Ziyue! Don’t look so wronged, okay?”Ye Sui continued, “Don’t think that I don’t know that you also want to marry a rich man. If you really don’t want to continue with Ma Lu, can I still force your head? What’s wrong with letting you help your younger brother after marriage? In this way, you can become a rich lady, and Libang can have a promising future. What’s wrong with that? Let me tell you, don’t be too selfish! It wasn’t easy for me to raise you. Let’s not talk about supporting your younger brother! You have to return the favor of raising me!” ”

Ye Sui couldn’t be bothered to say too much to Zhou Ziyue.

Zhou ziyue bit her lip and didn’t say anything.

On the other side.

“After Bai Jingshu returned to the room, Lin Ze was coaxing the child. ”

“Hearing Bai Jingshu’s voice, the originally quiet child instantly started to babble. ”

“”Baby, I’m back.” ”

“Bai Jingshu walked over and picked up the child, ”

“lin Ze asked with a smile, “Who won?” ”

“Hearing this, Bai Jingshu sighed. “I really misjudged.”Who would have thought that Zhou Ziyue was actually a person who wasn’t what she seemed. ”

“”Don’t forget our bet,”Lin ze said. ”

“”Yes, yes, yes! I Won’t forget it!”Bai Jingshu continued, “Then how should we deal with the rest of the matters? I think Zhou Ziyue’s situation now seems to be ready to marry Maru.” ”

But Maru was just playing around with Zhou Ziyue.

“”You don’t have to care about this. Maru will settle it herself,”Lin ze said. ”

Bai Jingshu nodded. “Alright.”

“After saying that, Bai Jingshu said again, “Nothing will happen, right?” ”

“”It won’t,”Lin Ze said. ”
