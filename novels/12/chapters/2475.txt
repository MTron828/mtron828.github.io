Then help her.

“It was a cold-blooded and merciless sentence, and it sent chills down people’s spines. ”

“The assistant was stunned for a moment before continuing, “Yes, Boss.” ”

“Song Shiyu picked up the pen on the table and signed the document. Then, he asked, “How’s the situation in Yun Jing?” ” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The assistant glanced at song Shiyu. “Old Master Chen has already rushed back to Yun Jing.”

“”Alright.”Song Shiyu nodded slightly and continued, “Let Liu Sheng know that it’s business as usual. I will hire the best lawyer for the victim.” ”

The Zhao family was not a small family in Yun Jing. Why would they need song Shiyu’s help to hire a lawyer?

Song Shiyu’s actions showed his stance.

The Chen family was... finished this time.

“The assistant nodded. “Yes, Boss.” ”

Yun Jing.

Zhao family.

“Zhao Liu paced around the hall. “Dad, what do you think happened this time? I feel a little uneasy.” ”

“Everyone in Yun Jing knew that the Chen family owed song Shiyu a favor, so song Shiyu had always supported the Chen family in the open and in the dark. ”

“Because of this, very few people in Yun Jing dared to provoke the Chen family. Even though Chen Youlong had always been extremely arrogant, everyone only dared to suffer in silence. ”

“However, this time, not only did song Shiyu not support the Chen family, he even personally sent Chen Youlong in. No matter how one looked at it, it did not seem normal. ”

Could it be that the sun would rise from the West?

“Zhao Liu had suffered a lot in front of Chen Youlong before, and he had a shadow in his heart! ”

“Old Master Zhao and old master Chen were about the same age, and both of his temples were gray. “Calm down.” ”

“”Dad, it’s already so late, and you’re still telling me to calm down!”Zhao Liu continued, “What do you think Third Master song is playing at?” ”

Zhao Liu felt as if he was dreaming.

“When the song family sent the news, he thought that he was going to die. He did not expect that song Shiyu was here to help him this time. ”

The person who went to prison was Chen Youlong.

“Old Master Zhao stroked his beard and said, “The Chen family has been relying on the song family to support them all these years. They have been running rampant in cloud capital. When things get extreme, they will definitely rebel. This is their retribution!” ”

“What if Third Master song is setting us up?”Zhao Liu continued to ask.

Old Master Zhao laughed lightly. “Do you think that third master song is as free as you?”

Song Shiyu was not the kind of person who had leisure and elegance.

“So you’re saying that the Chen family is going to be in trouble?”Zhao Liu asked.

“Old Master Zhao continued, “Let’s wait and see.” ”

“Okay.”Zhao Liu nodded.

“At that moment, footsteps came from outside the door. ”

“Old Master!”

It was the Butler’s voice.

“What’s Wrong?”Old Master Zhao stood up.

“The Butler brought a man in a suit and walked in. “Old Master, this is lawyer Jin.” ”

Lawyer Jin?

Old Master Zhao was stunned.

“”Hello, Old Master Zhao. I’m Jin Yuan from VL law firm.”Jin Yuan bowed slightly and handed a business card to Old Master Zhao. “This is my business card.” ”

VL law firm’s Jin Yuan?

“Old Master Zhao suddenly realized something and immediately took the business card. “Hello, lawyer Jin. Please take a seat.” ”

“In Yun Jing, almost everyone knew about VL law firm, let alone Jin Yuan. ”

Jin Yuan was a gold-medal lawyer who had a firm foothold in the world. He was famous in an international case and could not be invited by ordinary people.

“But today, Jin Yuan actually took the initiative to visit. ”

Jin Yuan followed and sat down.

“Zhao Liu, who was beside him, was still dizzy. ”

“Elder Zhao continued, “Quickly pour some tea for lawyer Jin.” ”

“”Elder, you’re welcome.”Jin Yuan opened his briefcase and took out a document. “This is the material I prepared. Please take a look at it. If you don’t think it’s a problem, we’ll follow this plan.” ”

“Elder Zhao took the document and looked at it carefully. Finally, he turned to look at the servant beside him. “Bring my glasses over.” ”

“Okay.”

The servant immediately trotted over to get the glasses for Old Master Zhao.

“Soon, the glasses were brought over. Old Master Zhao took the glasses and put them on. Then, he carefully looked at the contents of the materials. ”

“Ten minutes later, he looked at Jin Yuan in disbelief. “Lawyer Jin, I remember that I visited you before, but you said that you weren’t free.” ”

“Jin yuan smiled and said, “Boss song entrusted me to come.” ”

“Third Master Song?”Grandfather Zhao asked.

Jin Yuan nodded.

“Jin Yuan could reject anyone, but he could not reject song Shiyu. ”

“If he was thousand-li horse, then song Shiyu was his Bo Le. ”

“In that international case, no one believed that he could win. After all, he was just a nobody at that time. ”
