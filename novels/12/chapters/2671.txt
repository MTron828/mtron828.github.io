Ye Zao Winked at Lin Ze with his left eye.

The siblings did not need to say much to understand each other’s thoughts.

“After receiving the communicator, Bai Jingshu immediately contacted elder Bai. ” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Soon, a transparent screen appeared in the air, and elder Bai appeared on the screen. ”

“Jingshu.”

“Grandpa!”

“Elder Bai sat on the chair in the courtyard as usual, basking in the sun. Seeing this scene, Bai Jingshu’s eyes turned slightly red. ”

“Where’s the baby? Let Me See the baby.”

Lin Ze immediately carried the baby over.

“Elder Bai stood up from the chair in excitement and said with a smile, “This child looks like Ah Ze! Like Ah Ze!” ”

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “Grandpa, look at what you’re saying. Don’t you look like me?” ”

“”I look like you too, but more like Ah Ze,”elder Bai said. ”

“As he spoke, elder Bai’s gaze never left the child. ”

“Elder bai continued, “What’s the baby’s name?” ”

“”Her big name is Lin Xi, and her nickname is tie Zhu.” ”

“”Bai Lu Weixi. Good name! Did you name it, or did the baby’s father name it?” ”

“Bai Jingshu said, “Tie Zhu was named by the baby’s father, and her big name was given by Auntie.” ”

“Old Master Bai smiled and said, “So it was Miss ye who named him. No wonder!” ”

The topic of conversation between the two of them had always been about the child.

“Bai Jingshu seemed to have suddenly thought of something and continued, “Grandfather, we’re preparing to come back to see you tomorrow.” ”

“Tomorrow?”Old Master Bai frowned slightly. “Why are you guys coming back? I’m Fine! There’s no need to see me! The child is too young. You Can’t be parents like this! You have to be responsible for the child!”

“Bai Jingshu immediately explained, “Grandfather, we’re not bringing the child back.” ”

“”No, no, the child is still so young. How can he leave you!”Old Master Bai continued, “Jingshu, grandfather knows that you’re a filial and good child, but there’s really no need to be like this! “Grandfather is fine. A few days ago, your aunt came back. If you don’t want grandfather to worry, you’re not allowed to come back. Wait until the child is older before bringing the child back!” ”

“Grandpa!”

“Elder Bai smiled. “Jingshu, AH. Grandpa knows that you’re filial, but didn’t you see Grandpa Now? Grandpa is really doing well!” ”

“Lin Ze continued, “Grandpa, the child asked my parents to take care of you. Jingshu and I haven’t been back for a long time. It’s our duty to come back and see you.” ”

“Lin Jincheng and ye Shu also walked over at this time. They smiled and said, “Don’t worry, Grandpa. We’ll take good care of the child. We won’t let you and Jingshu Worry.” ”

“Grandfather Bai first asked Lin Jincheng and ye Shu, then, he said very seriously, “Jingshu, Ah Ze, I’m telling you very seriously now, don’t come back! Even if you come back, I won’t Welcome You, and I won’t see you!” ”

“At this point, grandfather Bai paused, then, he said, “When the child is older, you don’t have to say it. Grandfather also welcomes you back at any time. Not Now! Jingshu, you’re a mother now. You’re not allowed to be petulant.” ”

“”Jingshu, did you hear that? !” ”

“Bai Jingshu knew elder Bai’s temper and character, so she could only nod. “I heard, grandfather. You must take good care of yourself.” ”

“”Okay.”Elder bai continued, “Let’s call it a day for now. We’ll video chat for a few minutes every day in the future. Let me take a look at the baby.” ”

“Okay.”

“After video chatting with elder Bai, Lin Ze smiled and looked at Bai Jingshu. “You can rest assured now, right? I see that grandfather is in a very good condition. He’ll definitely wait until the baby goes to see him.” ”

“”Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded and continued, “I really have to thank burning!” ”

Lin Ze patted Bai Jingshu’s head. “I already said that we’re a family.”
