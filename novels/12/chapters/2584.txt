“When people compared themselves to each other, it was inevitable that they would feel resentment. ”

“Xia Xiaoman turned to look at the two of them and asked with a smile, “Do you guys have any taboos?” ”

Zhou Cuihua was still in a daze when Li Hang used his elbow to bump into Zhou Cuihua’s elbow without anyone noticing.

“Zhou cuihua instantly reacted and said with a smile, “No, no taboos. Xiaoman, just make some home-cooked meals. We’re all on the same side. You and cousin-in-law don’t have to be too polite.” ”

“Lin Qingxuan said, “Alright, I’ll Go and prepare.” ”

Xia Xiaoman nodded. “You go ahead.”

“After Lin Qingxuan left, Zhou Cuihua held Xia Xiaoman’s arm and said, “Xiaoman, you’ve really married the right person this time!”This sentence did not sound like much. If one were to savor it carefully, it could be said to be a heart attack. ”

“Xia Xiaoman and an Dongliang’s marriage was unfortunate. Even though a long time had passed and the wound had begun to scab, when it was torn open again, it would still bleed profusely. ”

Xia Xiaoman smiled and did not say anything.

“Zhou cuihua narrowed her eyes and continued, “Xiaoman, you don’t have to worry about anything now. Unlike me, you don’t have to worry about this and that!” ”

“”Cousin Sister, your family is happy now. Cousin brother-in-law is also very capable. Hang Hang is also very capable. What’s there to worry about?”Xia Xiaoman asked. ”

“Zhou cuihua sighed and said, “What’s there to worry about! Other than bragging, what else does your cousin brother-in-law know?”In her eyes, her husband was still an outstanding man in the past, in comparison to Lin Qingxuan, he was now nothing more than trash! ”

“Xia Xiaoman said, “You can’t brag about two houses in the capital city.” ”

“To be honest, Zhou Cuihua’s husband was quite capable. ”

“After all, two houses in the capital city could not be bought just like that. ”

Zhou cuihua waved her hand. “He can’t be compared to my cousin-in-law.”

“At the end of her sentence.., zhou cuihua continued, “And hang hang, he’s even older than Lizi! I haven’t found a boyfriend yet, so how can I not be anxious? “By the way, Xiaoman, do you have a suitable boy by your side? “If you do, introduce him to hang hang.” ”

“Since Xia Xiaoman did not answer her, she could only take the initiative to bring it up. ”

“Xia Xiaoman said, “I don’t seem to have any suitable boys by my side. When I meet a suitable one, I will definitely introduce him to hang hang.” ”

What did she mean by there was no suitable one?

She clearly did not want to introduce him to Li Hang. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

This Xia Xiaoman was really hypocritical!

Zhou Cuihua was very angry!

“Why was Xia Xiaoman’s daughter able to marry into a rich and noble family, while her daughter did not even have the chance to get to know a rich and noble family? ”

It was unfair!

It was very unfair!

“Although she was very angry, Zhou Cuihua didn’t show it. Instead, she smiled and said, “Xiaoman, thank you for your trouble. When you meet a suitable boy, you must think about hang.” ”

“”Don’t worry, I will.”Xia Xiaoman nodded. ”

“Zhou cuihua turned to look at Li Hang. “Hang, quickly thank your aunt.” ”

“”Thank you, aunt,”Li Hang said. ”

“”You’re welcome.”Xia Xiaoman picked up a cup of coffee and said, “Cousin, you’re welcome. have some coffee.” ”

“”Okay, you’re welcome.”Zhou cuihua picked up the cup of coffee. ”

“After saying that, Xia Xiaoman continued, “I went back the year before last. I wonder how aunt and uncle are doing recently?” ”

Zhou Cuihua’s parents were Xia Xiaoman’s aunt and uncle.

“Ever since Zhou Cuihua settled down in the capital, she rarely went home to visit her parents. ”

“Xia Xiaoman went to visit the old lady the year before last, but Zhou Cuihua had not gone back for four to five years. ”

“If she did not even go back, how would Zhou Cuihua know about her parents’situation? ”

“But under such circumstances, Zhou cuihua naturally could not admit that she had not gone back. ”

“Zhou cuihua said, “They’re all fine. Xiaoman, you don’t have to worry about them.” ”

“Okay.”Xia Xiaoman nodded. “As long as they’re healthy.”

The two of them chatted for a while.

“Soon, it was lunchtime. ”

“Lin Qingxuan walked in with the child in his arms. “Xiaoman, it’s time to eat.” ”

“”Okay.”Xia Xiaoman nodded and stood up. “Cousin, Hang Hang, let’s go eat first.” ”

Zhou cuihua and Li Hang followed her footsteps.

Xia Xiaoman walked to Lin Qingxuan’s side and took Xiao Lin Zhi from his arms.

Xiao Lin Zhi was especially happy to be held in his mother’s arms.

“Zhou cuihua walked forward and said, “Xiaoman, this child really looks like you and cousin-in-law!” ”

“Xia Xiaoman smiled and said, “He looks more like his father.” ”
