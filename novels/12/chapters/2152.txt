“Initially, he thought that he would be able to see ye Han immediately after making a personal trip to the state of Changyue. Who knew that he would be informed by Ye Han’s secretary that Ye Han was currently in a meeting and needed to wait a little longer. ”

“Damn it!”Leo took off his hat. “What a waste of time for a meeting to be held until now! It’s a waste of time!”

“Leo had trained on Earth for a period of time, so his speaking style was very similar to that of a northern man. ”

The Secretary looked at Leo and didn’t say anything.

Leo held the hat and spun around on the spot.

“The secretary checked Leo’s information and found out that when everyone was actually the tribe leader of the Zerg, the cold sweat on his forehead had never disappeared. He hoped that ye Han would come out sooner. ”

It was Leo who killed without batting an eye. He was naturally violent. What if Leo could not wait and took it out on her?

“As if he could read the secretary’s mind, Leo turned to the secretary and pulled out a big smile. “Don’t worry, little girl. Although I have a short temper, I’m not the kind of unreasonable person! I Won’t hit you!” ”

“For some reason, after hearing these words, the secretary trembled even more. ”

“In order to show that he was really not scary at all, Leo laughed even more exaggeratedly. ”

“The secretary really wanted to say that his smile was uglier than crying, but she didn’t dare! ”

“At this moment, she finally saw ye Han come out of the meeting room. ”

“The secretary immediately went up to him, “Chief, the Leo clan leader is looking for you!”After saying that, the secretary immediately hid behind ye Han. ”

“Ye Han looked up and saw Leo standing there, striding over, “The Leo clan leader.” ”

“Mr. Xiao Ye!”

“Leo finally didn’t have to keep smiling anymore. He went up to him and said, “Mr. Xiao Ye, I have something urgent to talk to you!” ”

“”Let’s talk inside,”ye Han said. ”

“Okay.”Leo nodded and followed ye Han’s footsteps.

The two came to Ye Han’s office.

Ye Han made Leo a cup of tea that he brought back from Earth.

“Just as he brought it over, Leo asked, “Is it da Hong Pao from Wuyi Mountain?” ”

“You know about it too?”Ye Han was a little surprised.

Leo nodded. “I spent some time on Earth in the past.”

“”I see.”Ye Han handed the tea to him and continued, “What urgent matter do you have?” ”

“It’s like this...”Leo told Leo the complete version of the rumor he had heard.

“”What? Young Master Dongli brought his girlfriend back to the main alliance?”Hearing this, Ye Han asked in surprise. ”

“”Yes.”Leo nodded, “But did you get the main point wrong?” ”

The main point should be that the person that young master Dongli brought back was ye Zhuo’s fake!

“”When did this happen?”Ye Han had just taken over Changyue and had many things to deal with. During this period of time, he had been busy and actually did not know about this matter. ”

“”Within a week,”Leo said. ” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Ye Han nodded.

“Seeing him like this.., leo was very speechless and said, “Ye Han, what’s wrong with you? My burning father is about to be impersonated by someone, yet you can still laugh! That imposter not only looked like burning father, she even gave him a name that was exactly the same as burning father! A small earthling still dares to be so arrogant!” ”

“”She’s not an imposter, clan leader Lei.”Ye Han looked at Leo, “Listen to me and tell you slowly.” ”

“”Tell me what?”Leo frowned slightly, very displeased with Ye Han, “What do I have to say to you! Ye Han, I didn’t expect you to be such a person! The outside world is saying that you stole the position of burning father. In the past, I didn’t believe it, but now I can see that you’re a villain!” ”

“Ye Han continued, “Young Master Dongli’s girlfriend is my sister.” ”

“”What did you say?”This time, it was Leo’s turn to be surprised. His eyes were wide open. ”

“”That’s right.”Ye Han nodded. “She is my sister, Ye Zhuo.” ”

“”Really?”Leo could not react in time. “If she is really father Zhuo, why does she have the identity of an Earthling?” ”

“”It can’t be fake, it can’t be real.”Ye Han continued, “It’s not like you don’t know my sister’s ability. As long as she wants to, what identity can’t she get?” ”

“”That’s true!”Leo said excitedly, “So, she’s really burning father?” ”

“Yes.”

“Leo said, “That’s great! The day after tomorrow is the family recognition banquet. At that time, I’ll have to prepare more gifts to give my burning father enough face!” ”

“Ye Han secretly remembered these words. In terms of gifts, he definitely couldn’t lose to Leo. ”

“Not long after, this news spread in the world of bigwigs. ”

“Thus, the circle formed a strange wind. ”
