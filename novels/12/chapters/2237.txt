“”I was delayed by something on the way,”Bai Jingshu said. ”

“”Come, come, come. Come in with Mom. Mom has something to tell you.”Zhou Ying held Bai Jingshu’s hand and walked inside. ”

Zhou Ying only let go of Bai Jingshu when they reached the bedroom.

“Bai Jingshu asked curiously, “Mom, What’s the matter? We Can’t talk about it outside, but we have to talk about it inside.” ”

“”It’s a good thing.”Zhou Ying pressed the button on her watch, and a transparent screen immediately appeared in the air. On the screen was a man’s profile and a half-body photo. “Jingshu, what do you think of this man?” ”

“He’s alright.”Bai Jingshu nodded.

“Zhou Ying continued, “He’s the youngest son of the Cheng family. He graduated from a top-tier university and has two doctorates. I heard from your aunt that he’s very likely to take over the Cheng family in the future!” ”

“OH.”

“Zhou Ying smiled and said to Bai Jingshu, “Jingshu, you also think that this boy is not bad, right?” ”

“Bai Jingshu subconsciously felt that there was something wrong with this sentence. She frowned slightly and said, “Mom, what do you mean by this?” ”

“Zhou Ying continued, “If you think it is not bad, we will settle the matter. You are not young anymore! “Jingshu, you don’t know that we’ve shown the boy your photo. He’s very satisfied! “Not only does he not dislike your hobby, he even supports you! “Tell me, where in this world can I find such a good boy!” ”

“”Mom, What’s settled? Do you think marriage is Child’s play? Besides, I haven’t even met him once!”Bai Jingshu was speechless. ”

“”You’re already so old, why are you still picking on him? Take advantage of the fact that someone has taken a liking to you and quickly settle the matter! Let me tell you, the youngest son of the Cheng family is really in demand! You’re also lucky, yet he fell in love with you at first sight! Otherwise, how could it be your turn?”Although Zhou Ying was Bai Jingshu’s mother.., in her mother’s eyes, her children were the most outstanding. ”

“However, when faced with Bai Jingshu, Zhou Ying couldn’t bear to lie to herself. ”

Bai Jingshu was simply too different from ordinary people!

Zhou Ying found it hard to accept that she only knew how to run to Earth all day long?

What was Earth full of?

Low-class people!

Low-class civilizations!

Abandoned civilizations!

“However, Bai Jingshu treated Earth as her second home. Not only that, she was also infatuated with Earth’s development history. ”

“”Mom, haven’t you heard? All Love at first sight is based on lust!”Bai Jingshu said. ”

“”So what if it’s based on lust? Have you looked in the mirror? Other than this face, what else can you see? You Can’t compete with Bai Mo, and you can’t compete with Bai Yuanyuan. Who Do you think you can compete with?”Zhou Ying said angrily, “Bai Jingshu! Can you take a good look at yourself! Take a good look at yourself?” ”

Zhou Ying was very satisfied with her family.

“Not only was the young man promising, but his character was also good. ”

“Most importantly, the family also promised to give her a large betrothal gift. ”

Zhou Ying had recently invested in a business deal and lost all her money. It was the time when she was in need of money.

There were not many families like the Cheng family who were rushing to give away money. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“”I know very well how I am.”Bai Jingshu naturally became numb after hearing so many cold and heartless words. She continued, “Mom, if you want to order it, go ahead and order it. I will never agree to it!” ”

Zhou Ying was so angry that she almost couldn’t breathe.

“At this moment, Bai Jiasheng walked in from outside and just happened to hear this sentence. He directly slapped Bai Jingshu’s face. ”

Slap.

It was crisp and clear.

“”You UNFILIAL Thing, is this how you talk to Your Mother? Who Is She? She’s your mother! If your mother hadn’t raised you since you were young, would you be here now?” ”

“Bai Jingshu’s head was knocked to the side, and blood trickled down the corner of her mouth. ”

Was she disappointed?

She wasn’t disappointed.

Because she had been too disappointed a long time ago.

She had always been like this since she was young.

This was also the reason why Bai Jingshu liked Earth so much.

“”Hurry up and apologize to your mother,”Bai Jiacheng continued. ”

Bai Jingshu did not say anything.

Bai Jiacheng raised his palm again. “Do you understand?”

“Beat me to death.”Bai Jingshu raised her head to look at Bai Jiacheng. Her expression was very calm. “You don’t have to worry about beating me to death.”

“The Bai family was furious. If Zhou Ying had not held him back, he might not have been able to control himself. ”

Bai Jingshu had been like this since she was young.

Rebellious.

“Even though her grades were excellent, her mind had never been on the right path. ”
