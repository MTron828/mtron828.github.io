Chapter 766: 171: No. 1! 2 being fought over by a few big shots

Translator: 549690339

The people who originally thought that ye Zao was being unreasonable were also stunned.

They had to say.

What ye Zao said was too reasonable.

“When they encountered something, they would always stand at the moral high ground. They could not see the other party’s suffering at all, causing them to forget that ye Zao was the real victim. ”

“She did not cheat, nor did she impersonate someone else. She was being questioned by Liu Caiyi for no reason. ”

This was an insult to her personality!

The one who had been wronged was ye Zhuo.

What right did Han Zhen have to persuade Ye Zhuo to be kind?

“At this moment, a clear and shallow voice sounded again. “Don’t persuade others to be kind without going through the suffering of others. President Han, I hope you can understand this principle.” ”

Under the light.

She just stood there without any expression on her picturesque face. The light cast a layer of snow on her body.

Extremely cold.

Also extremely beautiful.

It was incomparable.

An Lizi and Zhao Pingting stood up and gave ye Zao a round of applause.

Clap Clap Clap —

The applause was almost deafening.

“At this moment, master Yu’s tightly knitted brows relaxed and the corners of his mouth curled up into a smile. ”

Good!

This was really too good!

As expected of his disciple!

“Don’t try to persuade others to be kind without going through their bank account!”

“Apologize!”

“Vice-president Liu must give us and miss ye an explanation.”

“You must apologize!”

The head of the publicity department of the Conference of Books took the lead and stood up.

“As the head of the publicity department stood up, more people stood up as well. ”

Everyone’s emotions seemed to have been exaggerated.

They became abnormally excited.

“Apologize!”

“Apologize to Miss Ye!”

“One after another, they had Liu Caiyi give Shuhai conference and ye Zao an explanation. ”

“This time, Liu Caiyi couldn’t stand it anymore. ”

She didn’t expect things to turn out this way.

The situation was forced.

It was impossible not to apologize now.

“Liu Caiyi took a deep breath and turned to look at ye Zao, trying to calm herself down. “Miss Ye, I’m really sorry for what happened just now. I apologize to you for my words and actions. I hope you can be magnanimous and forgive me.” ”

“Ye Zhuo lifted his chin slightly. “This time, I can let vice-president Liu Off the hook. I hope that vice-president Liu can be careful with his words and actions next time.” ”

Careful with his words and actions.

How could ye Zhuo dare to say such words to her without shame?

“No matter how powerful ye Zhuo was, she was only master Yu’s disciple. ”

“Yet, she was the vice-president of the Literature Association. ”

“Yet, she was still angry and could not speak. ”

She could only hold all her anger in her heart.

It was all Feng Xianxian’s fault for not fighting for her. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“If Feng Xianxian was the first place, would it be ye Zhuo’s turn to strut around here? ”

“In the end, she still misjudged Feng Xianxian. ”

Then she looked at Feng Xianxian.

“Sitting in the spectator stand, she was completely dumbfounded. ”

She could not believe that she had only scored 60 points.

She had studied for a long time before the assessment competition.

How could she have only scored 60 points?

But that paper was indeed written by her.

She was unwilling.

Feng Xianxian was very unwilling.

“Feng Xianxian looked at Ye Zhuo on the stage, wishing that she could break her silver teeth. ”

On what basis?

On what basis did ye Zhuo step on her to get to the top with a peace of mind every time?

Old Lady Lin also felt very uncomfortable in her heart.

“She had thought that if Feng Xianxian got first place, she would be able to see Master Yu’s regretful face. ”

Who would have thought.

“Not only did Feng Xianxian not get first place, she did not even get into the top ten. Instead, she allowed ye Zhuo to get first place and even got full marks. ”

It shouldn’t be!

“With Feng Xianxian’s strength, she shouldn’t have not even gotten into the top ten. ”

How did ye Zhuo get first place?

Could it be that Feng Xianxian wasn’t feeling well?

Was it affecting her performance?

“Old Lady Lin wanted to sigh, but she was afraid that Feng Xianxian would be upset after hearing it, so she could only laugh at Feng Xianxian and say in a low voice, “Xianxian, it’s fine! Failure is the mother of success. I believe that you’ll definitely get a good ranking next time.” ”

She believed in Feng Xianxian.

Ye Zao was lucky to get first place this time.

“If Feng Xianxian had not performed well, would ye Zhuo have been able to get first place? ”

Definitely Not!

Feng Xianxian sniffed. “I have let you down.”

“”It’s fine, it’s fine, silly child! It’s not your fault.”Seeing Feng Xianxian like this, Old Lady Lin’s heart ached. ”

“Although Old Lady Lin was indeed disappointed that Feng Xianxian did not get first place this time, she still did not want to see Feng Xianxian feel guilty because of this matter. ”

Because this was not Feng Xianxian’s fault at all.

“After Liu Caiyi apologized, ye Zhuo turned to look at Han Zhen. “President Han, I’m sorry for saying such unrealistic words to you just now. It was really forced by the situation. I hope you can understand.” ”

“At this moment, what else could Han Zhen Say? ”
