“Li Hang was a little hesitant. “Mom, actually, it’s quite good for me to follow my dad. There’s no need to hurt the harmony between the two of you because of me.” ”

“Zhou cuihua said, “There’s no harmony between him and me to begin with!” ”

Li hang sighed and ultimately agreed to Zhou Cuihua’s request.

“The next day, Li Hang used his own name to arrange a meeting with Li Dalong at a cafe. ”

“”Dad…”Li hang looked at Li da long as if he had 10,000 words to say, but in the end, he couldn’t say anything. ”

“Li da long said, “Hang Hang, I already told you what I should say yesterday. I Don’t agree to you following her!” ”

“”You have no right to disagree!”At this moment, Zhou Cuihua’s voice suddenly appeared in the air. ”

Li Da Long looked up and indeed saw Zhou Cuihua.

“Zhou cuihua placed her handbag on the coffee table and said, “Li Dalong, Hang Hang is my daughter, and she is now an adult. She has the right to choose.” ”

“Hang Hang is Your Daughter?”Li Dalong looked at Zhou cuihua.

“Zhou cuihua smiled and continued, “Li Dalong, what can you give Hang Hang?” ”

Li Dalong felt that Zhou Cuihua’s words were extremely laughable. “What About You? What can you give Hanghang?”

“Zhou cuihua turned to look in the direction of the door. “Zhengxuan, come in.” ”

“The next second, boss Wang walked over from the direction of the door. ”

“”Let me introduce you. This is my fiancé, Wang Zhengxuan. He’s also the chairman of LK Real Estate.” ”

“Boss Wang politely nodded at Li da long. “Hello, Mr. Li.” ”

Li Da Long was stunned.

“Before Li da long could react, zhou cui hua continued, “Zhengxuan will treat hang hang as his biological daughter in the future. He can give hang hang a bright future. May I ask, what can you give hang?” ”

“Compared to boss Wang, Li Da Long was nothing! ”

“Boss Wang immediately said, “Mr. Li, don’t worry. I don’t have a daughter, and I won’t have any other children in the future. I will treat hang hang as my own daughter. In the future, all the assets under my name will belong to hang hang.” ”

“Of course, the prerequisite was that Li Hang had to be surnamed Wang. ”ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Li da long immediately understood the meaning behind boss Wang’s words.

“I absolutely won’t allow my daughter to call others ‘father’!”Li Da Long said.

“Zhou cui hua continued, “Then I definitely won’t allow my daughter to call others ‘Mommy’! Besides, Zhengxuan can give Hang Hang, can you? Other than dragging hang hang down, what else can you do?” ”

Drag Li hang down?

This was originally a term that Li da long used to describe Zhou Cui Hua. He did not expect Zhou Cui Hua to use this term to describe him now.

“Li Da Long did not say anything. He turned to look at Li Hang. “Hang Hang, do you think so too?” ”

“Li Hang did not directly answer Li Da Long’s words. Instead, he said, “I want to follow mother.” ”

This sentence immediately made Li Da Long’s heart die.

She wanted to follow Zhou Cui Hua.

“Hearing this, Zhou Cui Hua became even more confident. She continued, “Did you hear Hang Hang’s Words? She wants to follow me, not you!” ”

Li Da Long did not say anything. He was in a state of shock.

He had never thought that Li hang would become like this.

What exactly made Li Hang become like this?

“Li hang continued, “Dad, Aunt Fan is a good person. In the future, just pretend that you don’t have a daughter like me. Have another child with Aunt Fan.” ”

“Since they had already fallen out, Li Hang did not want to continue pretending. ”

It was meaningless.

“”Hang Hang, do you really think so?”Li Da Long raised his head and looked at Li Hang. ”

“Li hang nodded and continued, “Dad, I am already an adult. I can judge right and wrong. Don’t worry, I will definitely not do anything that I will regret in the future.” ”

“”As long as you don’t regret it.”Li Da Long was very uncomfortable now. He continued, “Since you have already thought it through, then there is no point in me saying anything more.” ”

“From the moment Li Hang said that he wanted Li da long and fan Juan to have another child, his heart had already turned cold. ”

“He had doted on Li hang so much, but Li Hang had treated him this way. ”

“Hearing this, Li Hang was overjoyed. “So, Dad, you’ve agreed?” ”

Li Da long nodded. “You’re right. You’re already an adult. You’ll be able to judge right and wrong.”

“It was not sweet to twist the melon. At this moment, Li da long could only convince himself that he had never had this daughter before. ”

“”Dad, thank you.” ”

Li Da Long stood up from the coffee table. “I’ll be leaving first.”

“Li hang immediately chased after him. “Dad, Wait a moment.” ”

“At this moment, Li Da Long’s eyes suddenly regained their luster. Did Li Hang suddenly think things through? ”

“”Dad, why don’t we go and complete the procedures tomorrow?”Speaking up to this point, Li hang paused. “Are you free tomorrow?” ”

Some things could be thrown into chaos if they were determined.

He had to cut the Gordian knot quickly.

“Hearing this, the last glimmer of hope in Li Da Long’s eyes disappeared without a trace. He then said, “I’m free tomorrow.” ”

“Li hang said, “Then it’s settled.” ”

“Okay.”Li Dalong nodded.

“After leaving the cafe, Li Dalong did not go back directly. Instead, he went to fan Juan’s house and told her about this matter. ”

“Fan Juan was not too surprised when she heard this. After all, she had already guessed a little. ”

“”Dalong, have you told Hang Hang’s uncle and aunt about this matter?”Fan Juan asked. ”

“”Not yet,”Li Dalong said. ”

“Fan Juan continued, “Then you have to tell her uncle and aunt about this. Otherwise, they will think that you, the father, have abandoned your own daughter.” ”

Li Dalong nodded. “You’re right.”It was still a woman’s meticulous mind. She had not thought of this at all.

“After saying that, Li Dalong called Zhou Xiatian. ”

“When Zhou Xia Tian received the call, she was also very shocked. ”

She had thought that Li Hang was a sensible child. She had not expected that Li hang would actually do such a thing.

“After hanging up the phone, Li Da Long was still very sad and could not walk out. ”

“Fan Juan said from the side, “Da Long, actually, this matter has pros and cons for you.” ”

“What do you mean?”Li Da Long asked.

“Fan Juan continued to ask, “Do you know why Hang Hang isn’t close to you?” ”

“I don’t know.”Li Dalong shook his head.

“”Because you have too little company, resulting in her character being more or less influenced by her mother.”Fan Juan continued, “I still have some savings. After I marry you, I’ll sell this house. Let’s use this money to open a shop. From now on, Don’t go out to do business. Let’s accompany our child to grow up together.” ”

These words sounded very promising.

“The haze in Li Da Long’s heart immediately lessened by more than half. “Juan ‘er, do you really think so?” ”

“Yes.”Fan Juan nodded.

“Li da long continued, “Alright, then I’ll listen to you. Why don’t We Go and get the certificate the Day After Tomorrow?”They were not young anymore. If they decided to have children, they had to do it as soon as possible. ”

Fan Juan nodded. “Alright.”

“”Juan ‘er, thank you.”Li Da Long hugged fan Juan. “If it weren’t for you, I really wouldn’t know how I would have gotten over this hurdle.” ”

“Fan Juan smiled and said, “The two of us need each other, and we can accomplish things for each other.” ”

“He needed her, and she needed him. ”

“Early the next morning, Li Hang and Zhou cuihua came to look for Li da long. ”

The whole process was very smooth.

“In the middle, Zhou Xiatian also came, but no matter how he tried to persuade Li Hang, he would not listen, so he could only give up. ”

“Looking at the brand new household register, Li Hang’s mouth was full of smiles. ”

Her new life was coming.

“”Hang Hang, from now on, you will be a rich young lady!”Zhou cuihua continued, “Your uncle Wang also said that he would send you abroad to study.” ”
