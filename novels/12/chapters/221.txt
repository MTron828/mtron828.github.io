This child is just too kind!

“Old Madam Lin Sighed in her heart, her eyes filled with heartache. ” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“”I was afraid that you would worry,”Feng Qianhua cried. ”

“At that moment, the door of the emergency room was opened, and the Doctor walked out. ”

“Feng Qianhua quickly went up to him. “Doctor, how is My Daughter?” ”

“Old Madam Lin continued, “Doctor, our family has a lot of money! No matter how much it costs, please treat my granddaughter well!” ”

“The Doctor took off his mask and smiled. “Fortunately, she was sent here in time, so the patient is not in any danger now.” ”

“Feng Qianhua continued, “My daughter is about to take her college entrance exam. Will it affect her college entrance exam?” ”

“The Doctor hesitated for a moment before continuing, “As long as she recuperates properly, it will not affect her college entrance examination.” ”

“Doctor! Thank you!”Feng Qianhua bowed to the doctor excitedly.

“When she heard that Feng Xianxian was fine, old madam Lin heaved a sigh of relief. ”

“The doctor continued, “The patient has already been pushed to the ward. You guys should quickly go and take a look.” ”

Feng Qianhua and Old Madam Lin came to the ward.

Feng Xianxian’s head was injured. There was a bandage wrapped around her head and she looked very weak.

“”Good child, Are You Alright?”Old Mrs. Lin walked over and held Feng Xianxian’s hand. ”

“Feng Xianxian pretended to be strong and shook her head. “Grandma Lin, I’m Sorry! Not only did I not find brother Ah Ze, I even caused trouble for you and made you worry! By the way, have you found brother Ah Ze?” ”

“”Yes, I found him!”Old Mrs. Lin nodded hurriedly. “Don’t worry, Qianqian. Ah Ze is fine now. You just need to take care of yourself.” ”

“Feng Qianqian sniffled and cried, “I’m sorry, Grandma Lin. It’s all my fault. I made you misunderstand brother Ah Ze! I’m sorry...” ”

“Seeing Feng Qianqian like this, Old Mrs. Lin’s heart ached. “Silly child, it’s not your fault. It’s grandma who didn’t understand! Grandma knows that you did something wrong out of kindness! Don’t worry, Grandma didn’t Blame You!” ”

“”Thank you, Grandma!” ”

“”Good child, everything’s fine now!” ”

“Feng Qianhua stood by the side and wiped her tears. She said in a hoarse voice, “Aunt Lin, it’s indeed Xianxian’s fault this time. Fortunately, Ah Ze has been found. If Ah Ze hasn’t been found, then we, mother and daughter, will be sinners forever!” ”

“Madam Lin stood up and hugged Feng Qianhua. “Qianhua, I know that you and Xianxian are doing this for Ah Ze’s good, so I never meant to blame you!” ”

Feng Qianhua sneered in her heart.

This old woman was too hypocritical!

“If she really didn’t blame them at all, she wouldn’t have waited until now to think of her and Feng Xianxian. ”

This was clearly a case of blame!

“Fortunately, she had already thought of a countermeasure! ”

Old Mrs. Lin stayed in the hospital until midnight before leaving.

“After Old Mrs. Lin left, Feng Xianxian looked at Feng Qianhua worriedly. “Mom, will our trick really work?”Because she had just experienced what had just happened, when Feng Xianxian looked at Feng Qianhua, her eyes were still filled with fear. ”

Feng Qianhua was really too terrifying.

Feng Qianqian’s car accident was not an accident.

It was Feng Qianhua who had personally driven the car to crash it.

She would really do anything to marry into the Lin family!

“Feng Qianhua sat on the edge of the hospital bed. “Don’t worry, that old lady has already let go of the grudge in her heart.” ”

She had known Old Lady Lin for so many years.

No one knew Old Lady Lin better than Feng Qianhua.

The reason why she was willing to take such a risk and make such a decision was because she knew Old Lady Lin well enough.

If nothing happened to Feng Xianxian today...

Then the incident with Lin Ze would always leave a knot in Old Lady Lin’s heart.

The facts proved that Feng Qianhua’s guess was right.

“After learning that Feng Xianxian had been in a car accident, not only did Old Lady Lin not blame Feng Xianxian, but she also felt a little sorry for Feng Xianxian. After returning to the Lin family, she ordered the kitchen to make a bunch of nutritional supplements for Feng Xianxian to be sent to the hospital. ”

...

It was already the fourth month of spring.

“The weather was gradually warming up. After coming to the capital for so long, Li Qiandong had yet to show his face in the circle. Thus, he thought of holding a banquet in the most exclusive member-only hotel in the capital. ”

“Firstly, it was to gain connections. ”

“Secondly, the capital was a good place. The daughters of socialites did not look any worse than those in the capital. ”

Li Qiandong first thought of mu yourong.

He naturally could not hold a banquet without mu yourong.

The current Li Qiandong had already regarded mu yourong as his confidante.

“Then, Li Qiandong thought of ye Zao. ”

Ye Zao was the person he idolized the most.

“If ye Zao could attend the banquet, that would be the best. ”

“Moreover, ye Zao and Mu Yourong were once sisters. Although there was some misunderstanding between the two of them, misunderstandings were something that had to be resolved sooner or later. ”

“The two of them were both very outstanding people. Li Qiandong wanted to create some opportunities for the two of them to resolve their misunderstandings, so that the two of them could reconcile as soon as possible. ”

“After setting the date of the banquet and the person to be invited, ”

li Qiandong went to the CEN group to look for Cen Shaoqing.

The matter of the banquet was brought up.

“Cen Shaoqing had always been a person who did not like to be boisterous. Upon hearing this, he directly rejected, “I won’t go.” ”

“”You won’t go?”Li Qiandong was a little disappointed. “Fifth brother, look at you now. You’re like a monk. If you don’t go, then you won’t go. Don’t tell me you’re really going to become a monk in the future?” ”

Cen Shaoqing did not say anything.

“Li Qiandong continued, “It’s fine if you don’t go. I’ll go ask the Great God and miss mu if they’re going.” ”

“When he heard this, Cen Shaoqing suddenly raised his eyes. “When and where?” ”

Li Qiandong was stunned. “When and where?”

“”The time and place of the banquet,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“Hearing this, Cen Shaoqing looked at Li Qiandong in surprise. “Fifth brother, you’re going to attend the banquet?” ”

Cen Shaoqing’s tone was indifferent. “Tell me the time and place first.”

Li Qiandong told him the time and place.

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “I understand.”

“Li Qiandong looked at Cen Shaoqing, somewhat curious as to why Cen Shaoqing would suddenly change his mind. ”

Could it be...

That it was because of Mu Yourong?

“After all, Cen Shaoqing only suddenly decided to go after he mentioned mu yourong! ”

Right!

That must be the case!
