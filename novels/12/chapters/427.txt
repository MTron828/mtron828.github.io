“Song Shiyu did not stop sister Hong, but he did not say anything either. ”

Sister Hong opened the window.

A gentle breeze blew in from the outside.

“Because it had just rained, the smell was particularly pleasant. ”

“Sister Hong smiled and said, “Shiyu, I remember that you loved this kind of weather when you were young.” ”

When he was young?

Song Shiyu’s gaze was a little distant.

“When he was young, other than the pitch-black space and the crisp voice of his little brother, he had no other memories. ”

The dark night was like a dense and strong net.

It trapped him firmly inside.

“Thinking of this, song Shiyu opened another candy. ”

“Sister Hong’s gaze fell on the candy. “Shiyu, when old madam left, you were the one she was worried about the most. She hoped that there was someone who could accompany you down the road.” ”

“”Other than myself,”song Shiyu’s lips curled into a self-deprecating smile. “No one can accompany me on my journey.” ”

“Sister Hong said, “I know that Miss Ye is different to you. If I’m not wrong, Miss Ye should be the person you’ve been looking for all this while, right?” ”

Song Shiyu did not deny or say anything.

“Sister Hong continued, “Shiyu, I can see from your eyes that you have Miss Ye in your heart. You like her, right? Since you like her, why don’t you fight for her?” ”

“Do you think I have the qualifications?”Song Shiyu turned to look at sister Hong. His deep eyes were like a bottomless well. “Am I worthy of her?”

He was an unpardonable person.

His hands were stained with sin and evil.

His entire body was covered in blood.

“As for her, she was as pure as a piece of jade. ”

There wasn’t a single trace of impurity.

The two of them were two extreme existences to begin with.

So what if they liked each other?

“He was in a boundless hell, so why would he drag her down as well? ”

Sister Hong was stunned.

The song Shiyu she knew was not like this.

“Song Shiyu was selfish. As long as he could achieve his goal, he would do anything. ”

“Even if it was his biological father, he would not show any mercy. ”

But now...

“Facing Ye Zhuo, song Shiyu was timid. ”

He was so humble that he was reduced to dust.

This was too unlike song Shiyu.

“”Shiyu, how can you think like that? As long as you can make changes for Miss Ye, you can be worthy of Miss Ye.” ”

Song Shiyu shook his head. “The best thing I can give her now is protection.”

Sister Hong sighed.

“If song Shiyu’s father had been half as infatuated as song Shiyu, nothing would have happened later. ”

“”What about Miss Chen?”Sister Hong continued, “Miss Chen has been waiting for you for ten years.” ”

“”Did I ask her to wait?”At the mention of Chen Siyan, song Shiyu’s expression returned to normal. “I’ve already told her everything I need to say.” ”

Sister Hong sighed again.

It seemed that Chen Siyan’s love was destined to never blossom and bear fruit.

Song Shiyu suddenly looked up at sister Hong. “I want to drink brown sugar ginger water. Could you please make me a Cup?”

Brown sugar ginger water?

“Sister Hong was stunned. “Shiyu, are you not feeling well?” ”

“Song Shiyu shook his head. “No, I just want to drink it.” ”

“Okay.”Sister Hong went downstairs to boil ginger water for song Shiyu.

“When she went downstairs, she bumped into Chen Siyan. ”

“Sister Hong.”

“Miss Chen.”Sister Hong smiled at Chen Siyan.

“Chen Siyan said, “Sister Hong, how many times have I told you? There’s no need to be so polite with me. Just call me by my name.” ”

“Sister Hong maintained her smile. “No matter what, we can’t lose etiquette.” ”

Chen Siyan was not a fool.

“Of course, she knew that etiquette was only important to outsiders. ”

“To the people of the song family, she was an outsider. ”

...

Ye Zhuo did not get up until noon.

“Just as he got up, he received a wechat message from CEN Shaoqing. [ leader, do you want to have dinner together tonight? ] ”

“Cen Shaoqing not only addressed ye Zhuo as leader, he even changed the comment on wechat to ‘leader’ ”

Ye Zhuo replied: [ Okay. ] Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

[ what time do you want to meet? ] Cen Shaoqing replied instantly.

Ye Zao Thought for a moment. [ the weather is too hot. Let’s go a little later. ]

[7:30? ]

Ye Zao got out of bed and replied on wechat: [ Okay. ]

“After washing up, he went into the living room. Ye Zao actually saw Ye Sen and Ye Shu at home. “Mom, Uncle, why didn’t you go to the office?” ”

“Ye Shu said, “Your uncle and I are flying to Beijing in the afternoon.” ”

The afternoon flight?

Ye Zao was stunned. “Why is it so Sudden?”

“Ye Sen explained, “All the procedures have been completed. We have to go to Beijing in advance to take care of the other things. Why Don’t you come with us, Zao Zao? School will start in a few days anyway.” ”
