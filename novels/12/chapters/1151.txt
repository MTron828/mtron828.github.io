“After hanging up the phone, Jiang Xiaoyu went to the Shunxi Financial Group. ”

“What surprised Jiang Xiaoyu was that when Annie saw her, she didn’t deliberately make things difficult for her. Instead, she smiled and was brought in by her. “It seems that Miss Zhao is right. Miss Jiang, you came as promised.” ”

Jiang Xiaoyu was stunned.

What did Zhao Xueyin mean by this?

Could it be that she didn’t mind what happened a week ago at all?

“When she came to the office door, Annie reached out and knocked on the door. “Miss Zhao, Miss Jiang is here.” ”

“Come in.”

Jiang Xiaoyu pushed the door open and entered. She tried her best to smile. “Xueyin.”

“Zhao Xueyin raised her head slightly. “Annie, make Miss Jiang some tea.” ”

“Okay.”

“Jiang Xiaoyu hurriedly waved her hand. “No, there’s no need.” ”

“What’s the matter?”Zhao Xueyin asked.

“Jiang Xiaoyu couldn’t care less about anything else. She cried and said, “Xueyin, please help our family! As long as you’re willing to help our family, I’m willing to do anything!” ”

“Really?”Zhao Xueyin asked.

“Really!”Jiang Xiaoyu hurriedly nodded.

“Zhao Xueyin took out the things that she had prepared earlier. “I heard that you’ve been fighting with Ye Zao recently. Have you seen this pill? Think of a way to make ye Zao eat it, and I’ll help you!” ”

Although she didn’t know what the pill that Zhao Xueyin took was.

But Jiang Xiaoyu knew that it was definitely not something good.

“”No.”Jiang Xiaoyu shook her head. “Xueyin, other than this, I can promise you anything!” ”

She couldn’t betray her friends.

“Besides, ye Zao owed her a favor. ”

Zhao Xueyin smiled. “Let me think about it. What else can you do?”

“”Okay.”Zhao Xueyin raised her head slightly. “Why don’t you lie on the ground and bark like a dog? If you can do it, I’ll Promise You!” ”

Wasn’t Jiang Xiaoyu proud of herself?

Then she would let Jiang Xiaoyu have a taste of regret!

“At the thought of this, a sinister look flashed across Zhao Xueyin’s eyes. ”

Bark like a dog?

Jiang Xiaoyu was stunned.

She couldn’t react for a long time.

“Zhao Xueyin continued, “I’m going to count down from three. After three, even if you really bark like a dog, I won’t agree to it. Three, two... ”

“When she counted to one, Jiang Xiaoyu ‘plop’and knelt on the ground. ”

“However, she couldn’t open her mouth. ”

“At this moment, all her dignity was trampled on the ground by Zhao Xueyin. ”

Tears blurred Jiang Xiaoyu’s vision.

“”Scream, Miss Jiang. Miss Zhao is still waiting!”Annie said with a smile, “Let me remind you that Miss Zhao has an important meeting in three minutes. You Don’t have much time left.” ”

Three minutes.

She only had three minutes.

“For the Financial Group and the Jiang family, just scream! ”

“Jiang Xiaoyu closed her eyes and barked, “Woof!” ”

“Although her voice was very low, Zhao Xueyin still heard it. Her eyes were full of disgust. ”

Did she really bark like a dog?

Jiang Xiaoyu showed up just like that?

She thought Jiang Xiaoyu was very capable!

“Zhao Xueyin looked at Annie and asked, “Do you think Miss Jiang’s voice is similar?” ”

“Not really.”Annie shook her head. “Her voice is as soft as a mosquito! which guard dog would be so quiet?”

Zhao Xueyin looked at her phone. “I’ll give you another chance.”

Jiang Xiaoyu took a deep breath and barked again.

“Woof!”

“This time, it was very loud. ”

“”Only barked once?”Annie continued, “Miss Jiang, your dog only barked once?” ”

Jiang Xiaoyu knew that Zhao Xueyin was deliberately humiliating her.

“But now, she had no other choice. She could only put down all her dignity and barked twice. ”

“Okay.”

Zhao Xueyin said lightly.

Jiang Xiaoyu quickly raised her head.

She agreed! Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Zhao Xueyin finally agreed.

“”Xueyin, thank you! Thank you, sir, for not holding a grudge against me!” ”

“Zhao Xueyin continued, “Annie, it’s time. Bring the documents and follow me to the conference room for a meeting.” ”

A meeting?

Jiang Xiaoyu was stunned.

Didn’t Zhao Xueyin agree to help?

“Annie took the documents and said, “Miss Zhao, please!” ”

Jiang Xiaoyu immediately stood up and followed Zhao Xueyin’s footsteps. “Xueyin! You Can’t do this! I’ve done as you said! You have to help our family!”

“Zhao Xueyin turned around. “That’s right. I promised you just now, but I’ve Changed My Mind Now!” ”

“How can you do this?”

“Zhao xueyin smiled and said, “The decision is in my hands. Why Can’t I do this? Jiang Xiaoyu, you’re the one who’s begging me now!” ”

“Zhao Xueyin!”Jiang Xiaoyu pinched his fingers.

“Zhao Xueyin continued, “If you really want me to help you, take that medicine. When Ye Zhuo takes that medicine, I’ll help your family get through this difficult time! “Otherwise, your family will just have to wait for the announcement of their withdrawal from the financial world!” ”

Jiang Xiaoyu’s face was full of self-mockery. “So you made me bark like a dog just now just to humiliate me?”

“That’s right.”Zhao Xueyin nodded. “I’m humiliating you!”

“After saying that, Zhao Xueyin turned around and left. ”

“Annie walked beside Zhao Xueyin and said with some worry, “Miss Zhao, aren’t we going too far by doing this? What if Miss Jiang doesn’t come tomorrow?”After all, people had a bottom line. ”

Barking like a dog...

This matter would probably become Jiang Xiaoyu’s shadow for the rest of his life.

“Zhao Xueyin’s lips curled into a disdainful smile. “Not coming? If she doesn’t come to beg me, is she waiting for the Jiang Financial Group to declare bankruptcy?” ”

Therefore.

Jiang Xiaoyu had to come and beg her!

“Looking at Zhao Xueyin’s back, Jiang Xiaoyu was so angry that his whole body was trembling. His tears seemed to burst like a dam, and he couldn’t control them at all. ”

“Jiang Xiaoyu?”

“At this moment, a clear and shallow voice came from behind him. ”
