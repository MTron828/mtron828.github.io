Translator: 549690339

“Ye Zao chuckled, “Sister-in-law, what are you thinking about! ! Why would I hide it from you? If it’s nothing, it means it’s nothing! Besides, if there’s a problem with the needle, the patient will definitely have to think of a way to treat it. How can i solve the problem by hiding it from you? “Don’t worry, sister-in-law, you’re really fine!” ”

Bai Jingshu put the spray into ye Zao’s suitcase. “As long as you’re not lying to me.”

On the other side.

At the CEN residence.

“Old Mrs. Cen was sitting on the sofa listening to the Huangmei Opera, occasionally humming a few words to the rhythm. ”

“When she heard that Cen Shaoqing was going to the South China Sea, Old Mrs. Cen was a little speechless. “Why are you going to the South China Sea? It’s not like you’ve never been to the South China Sea before!” ”

“CEN Shaoqing said, “I’m going on vacation.” ”

Vacation? Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Old Mrs. Cen immediately perked up. Her eyes lit up when she looked at Cen Shaoqing. “Who are you going on vacation with? Is It Yezi?”

“No.”Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted. It didn’t seem like he was joking.

“No?”Old Mrs. Cen looked at Bai Jingshu. Her expression was one of disgust. “What do you want to do if you’re not going on vacation with searing flames? Why are you going on vacation alone? I think you’re Stupid!”

“Can’t you go on vacation alone?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“Old Mrs. Cen said, “I think there’s something wrong with your brain.” ”

Go On a vacation alone!

Cen Shaoqing did not say anything. He turned around and walked upstairs.

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Where are you going?” ”

“”To pack my luggage,”Cen Shaoqing said concisely. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen was speechless. “You’re a sand sculpture. You’re not really going on a vacation alone, are you?” ”

“Yes.”

“I forbid you to go!”Old Mrs. Cen said.

Cen Shaoqing turned a deaf ear.

“Unlucky Thing!”Old Mrs. Cen was so angry that she shook her head. “You should be a single dog for the rest of your life!”

Not long after.

The sound of footsteps came from outside the door.

“Grandma Cen.”Ye Zao’s voice came from the air.

“Old Mrs. Cen was stunned for a moment. She thought she was hearing things. When she opened her eyes, she saw ye Zao standing in front of the sofa. ”

“”Yezi!”Old Mrs. Cen stood up in surprise and hugged ye Zao. “Yezi, it’s really you! I thought I was hearing things!” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “It’s not an illusion to be human.” ”

“After saying that, ye Zao continued, “Where’s Cen Shaoqing?” ”

“At the mention of Cen Shaoqing, old Mrs. Cen said unhappily, “Don’t mention that unlucky thing.” ”

“”How did he make you angry? Tell me, I’ll help you beat him up!”Ye Zao said. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen said angrily, “Ye, do you know that he’s going to the South China Sea?” ”

“Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Yes, I know. I’ll go with him.” ”

Old Mrs. Cen finally realized that she had been deceived by Cen Shaoqing.

“”This sand sculpture knows how to deceive people now!”Old Mrs. Cen said angrily, “He just said that he would go by himself! After all this, it turns out that he is lying to me, an unarmed, weak, and kind-hearted old man!” ”

Old Mrs. Cen said a whole bunch of words in one breath without even taking a breath. It could be seen how good her lungs were!

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Don’t worry, I will help you beat him up later. One slap on the wall won’t even be able to button it.” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen held ye Zao’s hand and said with a smile, “My granddaughter-in-law is still the best!” ”

“Ye Zao continued, “Oh Right, Grandma Cen, why don’t I see Aunt Xiang?” ”

“They had been here for quite a while, but they still didn’t see Zhou Xiang. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen said, “Your Aunt Xiang recently signed up for an interest class. She’s going to class now.” ”

The rich and powerful wives had a very rich entertainment life every day.

“Today she was going on a trip, tomorrow she was going to play mahjong, and the day after tomorrow she was going to listen to a concert... ”

“OH.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Old Mrs. Cen looked upstairs and continued, “I don’t know what that Brat is doing, but he hasn’t come down. Ye, go upstairs and take a look.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

Ye Zhuo walked upstairs.

The entire third floor was CEN Shaoqing’s activity area.

“On the left was the gym, in the middle was the study, and on the far right was the bedroom. ”

“On the third floor, besides the cleaning time, there was no one else. ”

Ye Zhuo came to Cen Shaoqing’s bedroom with ease.

The bedroom door was open.

“Ye Zhuo reached out to knock on the door, but there was no response. ”

“Cen Shaoqing?”

There was still no response from inside.

Ye Zao frowned without leaving a trace. was he not inside?

“Thinking of this, Ye Zao walked inside. ”

The room was very quiet.

One could see that there was a suitcase in front of the cabinet that had already been packed.

Bang!

“At this moment, the bathroom door that was originally closed was pushed open. ”
