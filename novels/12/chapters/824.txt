“Lizi.”

The mother and daughter hugged each other tightly.

This was the first time the two of them had been separated for such a long time.

“Following that, an Lizi started to ridicule Xia Xiaoman. “Mom, why did you and uncle Lin Hack so much? If people who don’t know saw this, they would think that you came back from Africa!” ”

“Xia Xiaoman said very seriously, “Uncle Lin and I really went to Africa.” ”

“Ye Zhuo and Lin Ze also came down from upstairs. “Fourth uncle, fourth aunt.” ”

“Xia Xiaoman turned her head to look. “Zhuo Zhuo, ah Ze! Oh right, your fourth uncle and I also brought you gifts. I don’t know if you guys like them.” ”

“An lizi smiled and said, “Mom, you only prepared gifts for Zhuo Zhuo and Ah Ze? What about me? Where’s your biological daughter? You’re too biased!” ”

Xia Xiaoman opened the suitcase containing the gifts. It was full of gifts for the three children. “Your names are all on it. Take them and share them!”

“”Thank you, Mom!” ”

Xia Xiaoman was a very attentive person. She prepared skincare products for ye burning and a bunch of limited-edition luxury perfume that could only be bought overseas.

She had also prepared sneakers and a watch for Lin Ze.

“Ye Zhuo took his gift and walked over to Xia Xiaoman. “Thank you, fourth aunt, for your gift. I like it very much.” ”

“It’s good that you like it.”

Lin Ze also walked over to thank Xia Xiaoman.

“After staying in the east wing for a while, Lin Qingxuan prepared to make a trip to the west wing. Afraid that old Mrs. Lin would make things difficult for Xia Xiaoman, Lin Qingxuan did not tell Xia Xiaoman and prepared to sneak over on his own. ”

“Where are you going?”Xia Xiaoman came from behind.

“Lin Qingxuan said, “I’m going to the West Wing.” ”

“”I’ll go with you,”Xia Xiaoman said. ”

Lin Qingxuan hesitated for a moment. “Why don’t I Go Alone?”

“Xia Xiaoman continued, “I asked Lizi. She said that old lady has indeed changed a lot recently.” ”

“She’s very fickle.”

“Xia Xiaoman smiled and said, “What? Are you afraid that she’ll eat me? Let’s Go!” ” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“After saying that, Xia Xiaoman turned around and walked forward. ”

“Lin Qingxuan immediately trotted after her and said worriedly, “What if my mother scolds you?” ”

“”Scold her back! What else can we do?”Xia Xiaoman continued, “But I think your mother has really changed for the better this time.” ”

“Are you sure?”Lin Qingxuan knew Old Lady Lin very well.

He had a feeling that old lady Lin would not let it go so easily.

“Xia Xiaoman smiled and said, “Your mother is already in her eighties this year. She was harmed twice by the same mother and daughter. This time, she even became paralyzed. If she doesn’t turn over a new leaf, who in this family can tolerate her? Unless she really wants to sleep on the streets!” ”

“As they spoke, the two of them walked to the entrance of the west courtyard. ”

“Auntie Wang was standing there. When she saw Lin Qingxuan and Xia Xiaoman coming over, she was extremely excited and hurriedly ran into the house. “Old Madam! Old Madam! Qingxuan and Xiaoman are back!” ”

Old Madam Lin was sitting in her wheelchair and taking a nap when she suddenly heard Auntie Wang’s voice. She was so frightened that she hurriedly opened her eyes. “What’s Wrong?”

“Old Lady! Qingxuan is back!”

“Really?”Old Lady Lin’s eyes lit up.

“Auntie Wang smiled and said, “Of course it’s true! He has already walked to the entrance of the courtyard.” ”

“Old Lady Lin was so excited that her eyes were red. “Quick, hurry up and push me out to welcome them.” ”

Auntie Wang pushed Old Lady Lin out.

“Just as she walked into the courtyard, she saw Lin Qingxuan and Xia Xiaoman walking in. ”

“Qingxuan!”

Lin Qingxuan looked at Old Lady Lin who was sitting in the wheelchair. He couldn’t say ‘Mom’no matter how hard he tried. The smoke ring was a little red.

“In his memory, Old Lady Lin always had an overbearing manner and never bowed to anyone. ”

“Although Lin Qingxuan sometimes hated Old Lady Lin, he couldn’t accept the fact that Old Lady Lin was suddenly sitting in the wheelchair. ”

“Xia Xiaoman walked over with a smile. “We heard that you were injured a while ago, and we didn’t have time to rush back when we were overseas. How are you recovering now?” ”

“”Much better! Much Better!”Old Lady Lin looked at Xia Xiaoman and said with a face full of guilt, “Xiaoman, I’ve let you down in the past...” ”

“Xia Xiaoman smiled. “The past is in the past. Since you’ve already recognized your past mistakes, there’s no point in bringing it up again.” ”

“Hearing Xia Xiaoman’s words, Old Lady Lin felt even more guilty. ”

“Xia Xiaoman was so reasonable, but in the past, she... ”
