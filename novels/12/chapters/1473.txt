Translator: 549690339

Yala did not say anything else. He directly swallowed the pill in his palm.

Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly.

This Yala was a straightforward person.

Jack was shocked by Yala. “Minister! Are You Alright?”

Yala raised his hand slightly. “I’m fine.”

“Not only was he fine, Yala also felt that the pain from his internal organs seemed to have disappeared without a trace. He was also full of energy. ”

“He thought that this was a very ordinary pill, but he did not expect it to have such a great effect. ”

“Ya Lei raised his head in surprise, “What is this pill called?” ”

“”Qi strengthening pill.”Ye Zhuo continued, “How do you feel now?” ”

“Very good!”Ya Lei said.

“Ye zhuo nodded, “In that case, can we start?” ”

“”Yes!”Ya Lei made a ‘please’gesture, “An, the guest is the guest, you start first.” ”

“Then I won’t stand on ceremony.”Ye Zhuo picked up the die GU and lightly shook it twice before placing it on the table.

The entire weighing process took less than ten seconds.

“Ya Lei was stunned, he was starting to doubt if ye Zhuo really knew how to play dice. ”

The number of points in the DICE Cup depended on the strength and skill of shaking the die Gu.

But Ye Zhuo only shook it for a few seconds?

“As expected, he was still a child. ”

A faint smile appeared on ya Lei’s lips.

“Do you want to guess the number of points?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“Actually, the number of points in the dice could be determined from the sound. ”

“But Ye Zhuo shook it for too short a time, ya lei did not have time to listen carefully before ye Zhuo let go. ”

“However, even if ya lei did not listen carefully, he could guess that the number of points in the dice gu was definitely not high. ”

Ya lei smiled: “What do you think?”

“I think it’s three fives!”Ye Zhuo’s tone was clear and shallow.

Three Fives?

How was that possible!

“There were three dice in a dice cup, and the maximum number of points in each dice was five. ”

Ye Zhuo wanted to get three fives?

He was dreaming!

“Not to mention ye Zhuo, even he would not be able to get three fives in a short period of time. ”

Thus.

It was impossible!

“”An, are you dreaming?”Ya Lei said. ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled faintly, when did he open the die gu, “Mister Ya Lei, who is Dreaming?” ”

“When he saw the points on the table, Ya Lei was stunned. ”

“How, how could this be! ”

It was really three fives!

Ya Lei picked up the three dice and looked at them carefully.

“At first, when he saw the three fives, he thought that ye Zao must have changed the dice secretly. ”

“However, after checking, he found that there was nothing wrong with the dice. ”

“He had personally customized this dice in country A, and there was a mark on it. ”

How could this be!

Yala swallowed his throat and tried hard to calm himself down.

Calm down.

You must calm down.

“This was definitely an accident, yes, it was definitely an accident. ”

Two out of three wins.

There were still two rounds left!

He could not possibly have such good luck in every round.

“Ya Lei composed himself, placing the die into the die Gu and shaking it vigorously. ” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Ye Zhuo squinted, his ears moved as well. ”

About a minute later.

PA!

“Ya Lei slammed the die Gu on the table, turning to look at ye Zhuo, “Guess?” ”

“Ye Zhuo said slowly, “Three points, six points, five points.” ”

“”I have to admit, you are indeed very confident, but unfortunately, you guessed wrong.”Ya Lei smiled, he knew better than anyone the number of points in the die Gu that he had shaken, and then ya lei opened the die Gu. ”

“Seeing the number of points on the die, Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows, “Mr. Ya Lei, am I too confident, or are you being conceited?” ”

Ya Lei was stunned.

How could this be!

He was rolling two fives and a six!

Why did one of the Fives become a three?

“Without a doubt, he lost to Ye Zhuo in the first round. ”

But there was no need to worry.

There were two rounds left.

He had to crush ye Zhuo in the next two rounds.

“Under ya Lei’s puzzled gaze, Ye Zhuo picked up the dice gu and casually shook it twice before placing it on the table. ”

Less than ten seconds later.

“Ya Lei narrowed his eyes, what time was this? ”

Ye Zhuo directly picked up the die Gu.

“When he saw the number of points on the die in the air, Carl exclaimed, “Oh my God! Three Sixes! An, you are amazing! I admire you so much! You are my idol!” ”

This scene also scared ya lei.

Yala did not expect this result.

“In the last round, Ye Zhuo had rolled three sixes. Yala felt that ye Zhuo was extremely lucky. ”

Then...

What about this time?

“One could be considered lucky, but what about two times? Was two times still lucky? ”
