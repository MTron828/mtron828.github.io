“Chapter 1580: 239: it’s actually her, making things difficult in public. What is there that she doesn’t know? (there’s something else to say.)1”

Translator: 549690339

Ye Zao raised his eyes slightly and saw a face that was not unfamiliar.

The expression on the other party’s face was somewhat complicated.

“Shock, doubt, disbelief, and even more disbelief. ”

Ye Zao!

How could she see ye Zao Here!

What was this place?

What qualifications does ye Zao have to come here?

Who Is She?

Zeng Rou couldn’t believe her eyes.

An illusion. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

It must be an illusion.

This is the Zhao family of the south city.

What kind of family is the Zhao family?

The number one family in the south city.

“The Zhao family’s old lady’s surname is Bai, and her name is Bai Shu. ”

Bai Shu and Bai Tang are cousins.

Who Is Bai Tang!

That is the CEN fifth master’s grandmother of the Cen family of the capital city.

How could the Zhao family and the CEN fifth master be ordinary families?

Even Zeng Rou was related to the Zhao family because of her cousin.

“Zeng Rou’s cousin, Zeng Qiuwen, became the mistress of Bai Shu’s third son, Zhao Jiadong. Not long ago, Zhao Jiadong divorced his first wife and married the pregnant Zeng Qiuwen. In order to climb up the Zhao family tree, Zeng Qiuwen’s parents, zeng Qiuwen then brought her cousin, Zeng Rou, to the Zhao family for the New Year. ”

“In fact, Zeng Qiuwen had her own plans. ”

“She was a mother who valued her child. If it were not for the child in her belly, she would not have been able to marry Zhao Jiadong successfully. She could not stand firmly in the Zhao family just by relying on the child in her belly. She had to have an ally in the Zhao family. What a pity.., the people in the Zhao family all pretended to be high and mighty. They didn’t take a fancy to a woman who was a mistress. Although they didn’t say anything on the surface, they were secretly ostracizing her and mocking her. ”

“Coincidentally, at this time, uncle and aunt came looking for her, so Zeng Qiuwen went with the flow and helped Zeng Rou. ”

“Zeng Rou’s own circumstances were not bad. She was studying in a university and had a pretty face. There was no trace of a knife being used on her face. As long as she worked hard, she would definitely be able to marry into the Zhao family. When that time came.., she also had someone in the Zhao family who could sit together and discuss things. ”

“Ye Zao smiled faintly and said in a clear and shallow tone, “Long time no see.” ”

“It was a very soft sentence, but it was loud and clear. ”

Only when ye Zao opened his mouth did Zeng Rou dare to believe that it was true.

It was really ye Zao!

Oh My God.

“At this moment, Zeng Rou’s eyes widened as if she had seen something terrible. ”

“Seeing this, Bai Shu turned to look at ye Zao and said with a smile, “Zao Zao, do you know Zeng Rou?” ”

“Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Not only do we know each other, we were good friends before.” ”

Wasn’t the original owner ‘good friends’with Zeng Rou before?

“However, the original owner treated Zeng Rou as a good friend, but Zeng Rou and Lin Wuyue treated the original owner as a fool and played the original owner like a fool. ”

“Hearing this, Bai Shu smiled and said, “That’s great! I was worried that you would be unfamiliar when you came here! Zeng Rou, come over quickly!” ”

“For some reason, when Zeng Rou heard the words ‘good friend’, she shivered. ”

What did ye Zao Mean

Was she still the same ye Zao from before?

“She clearly still had that face, but the feeling she gave off was very different from before. ”

“Thinking about the few thousand yuan that ye Zhuo had cheated her of, Zeng Rou gnashed her teeth in hatred. ”

“She, Zeng Rou, had never suffered a loss in her life. She had always been the one who cheated others. When had others ever cheated her? ”

Ye Zhuo was the first person to cheat her of money.

Even though it was only a few thousand yuan.

“It was not very harmful, but it was extremely insulting! ”

“Seeing that Zeng Rou was still standing where she was, Bai Shu smiled and said, “Zeng Rou, what’s wrong with you? Come over quickly!” ”

Only then did Zeng Rou react. She walked forward and smiled. “Long time no see!”

“Bai Shu then introduced the family members to Ye Zao. “Zao Zao, this is your eldest uncle’s son’s youngest son, Zhao Ah Niu. This is Ah Niu’s sister, Zhao duo duo Duo! This is your eldest aunt’s youngest daughter, Yuan Fei.” ”

“”Hello, cousin-in-law. You can call me ah Niu.” ”

“”Cousin-in-law, I’m duo Duo. You can just call me duo duo.” ”

“”Cousin-in-law, I’m Yuan Fei. You can call me Feifei.” ”

“These three people were all a few years older than ye Zao, but Cen Shaoqing was older than them. They could only call her cousin-in-law. Just like when Cen Shaoqing came to the Lin family, he had to follow behind ye Zao and call everyone brother whenever he saw them. ”

“Yuan Fei looked at ye Zao and said with a smile, “I’ve long heard from Grandma that cousin-in-law is very beautiful. Now that I’ve met her, cousin-in-law is indeed more beautiful than a fairy! I’ve learned a lot!” ”

“Thank you.”Ye Zao looked at Yuan Fei. “You’re also very beautiful.”

“Yuan Fei was very happy to be praised as beautiful by beautiful people. She covered her face with her hand and said, “Really?” ”

“Of course it’s true!”Ye Zao nodded slightly.
