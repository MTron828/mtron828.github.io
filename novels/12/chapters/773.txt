Translator: 549690339

Liu Caiyi had been in the Chinese painting industry for many years and had accumulated a lot of connections.

Liu Caiyi was very confident in herself for the position of President of the association this time.

After all.

“Not only did she have connections, but she also had talent. ”

Her contributions to the Chinese painting industry over the years were obvious.

A painting that Liu Caiyi had casually drawn had been auctioned off for hundreds of thousands of dollars.

“Most importantly, not only was Liu Caiyi talented, but she was also good-looking. ”

She was one of those people who made people’s eyes shine.

Liu Caiyi was also known as the western beauty of Chinese painting in the Chinese painting industry.

There were even many people who came to admire her reputation.

That was why Liu Caiyi was so nervous when she saw ye Zhuo again. She wanted to help Feng Qianxian.

“Feng Qianxian’s looks were mediocre. She was not half as good as ye Zao, and she was not a threat to her. ”

But Ye Zao was different.

“Not only was ye Zao good-looking, his starting point was also high. ”

She had been Master Yu’s disciple since her debut.

What was she compared to ye Zao?

“Although Liu Caiyi had always been very confident in herself, she knew that although she was beautiful, she could not be compared to ye Zao. ”

“Once ye Zao entered the literary world and appeared in everyone’s field of vision, would she still be able to retain her title of ‘Xi Shi’? ”

Definitely Not!

“Ye Zao was too beautiful. Liu Caiyi was so beautiful that the moment she saw ye Zao, she felt that Ye Zao was just a vase. After hearing about the matter with Feng Xianxian, she became even more certain that ye Zao was not as good as Feng Xianxian. ”

“Because god was fair. If he gave you beauty, he would not give you wisdom. ”

Where in the world is there a person who has both?

Just like Liu Caiyi.

“In all these years, whether in the world of traditional Chinese painting, calligraphy, or literature, she had never seen a person who was more beautiful than herself. ”

“Therefore, in her view, people who were good-looking were all vases. ”

They could not be really knowledgeable!

“Ye Zhuo was so good-looking. With her strength, she could enter the world of literature. ”

Until...

Ye Zao got full marks in the assessment competition.

Full Marks?

How could ye Zao get full marks? !

Someone must have leaked the examination questions to ye Zao!

“Since she could get half of the examination questions for Feng Xianxian, master Yu’s connections were so wide. He could definitely help ye Zao cheat. ” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Although Liu Caiyi was unwilling, she couldn’t do anything about it. ”

Who asked ye Zao to have a good teacher!

“Fortunately, Ye Zao was only a person in the literary world. ”

“What Liu Caiyi needed to do now was to stand higher and higher in the Chinese painting world. One day, she would personally reveal ye Zao’s true colors in front of everyone. ”

Master Yu was already very old.

How many more years could he protect ye Zao?

Two years?

Three years?

Or ten years?

“Thinking of this, a glimmer flashed in Liu Caiyi’s eyes. ”

Just wait!

“When she became the President of the Chinese Arts Association, she would definitely find an opportunity to expose ye Zhuo’s true colors in front of everyone! ”

“”Caiyi, what are you thinking about?”Mother Liu waved her hand in front of Liu Caiyi. ”

“”I’m thinking about that new disciple of Master Yu. On the day of the assessment, she made me lose a lot of face.” ”

She apologized in public!

“This was the first time in Liu Caiyi’s life that she had apologized in front of so many people to someone younger, less experienced, and of a lower status than herself. ”

“Mother Liu frowned, “I heard that Master Yu’s disciple is very talented. For talented people, we should rope her in. Why do you have to offend her? Moreover, you are at a critical juncture of running for President!” ”

Mother Liu felt that Liu Caiyi should rope ye Zhuo in.

Let Ye Zhuo and Liu Caiyi stand on the same side.

A hint of disdain appeared in Liu Caiyi’s eyes. “You also said that you wanted to rope in talented people! Is Ye Zhuo Worthy?”

“”What do you mean?”Mother Liu asked, puzzled. ”

“Liu Caiyi continued, “Ye Zhuo’s grandfather and master Yu are old friends for many years. Moreover, I heard that ye Zhuo’s grandfather is a benefactor to master Yu. As for why Master Yu took ye Zhuo in as his disciple and why ye Zhuo got full marks in the assessment, I think you should know better than me.” ”

“There’s such a Thing?”Mother Liu was a little surprised.

She had originally thought that ye Zhuo really had great talent.

“Without great talent, he would be able to get full marks? ”

From the looks of it now.

There were still many tricks up his sleeve.

“After all, even Liu Caiyi could get half of the answers. ”

“If Liu Caiyi got the other half of the answers, then the person who got full marks would be Feng Xianxian. ”

“Thinking of this, mother Liu frowned. “I didn’t expect the literary world to be in such a mess now! Master Yu is too muddle-headed! Why do you have to sacrifice your life to repay his kindness?” ”
