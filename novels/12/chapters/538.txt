“Chapter 539: 136: an unexpected turn of events. It turned out to be a fan. Feng Xianxian, who was on the verge of collapse, noticed the health-preserving soup! 1”

Zheng Zimo was very excited. He did not expect to meet his goddess in the coffee shop!

“Actually, when ye Zao got out of the car just now, he already felt that ye Zao looked familiar. However, he did not dare to recognize him from afar. ”

It was only when ye Zao got closer and closer.

This was really his goddess!

He had never thought that he would meet his goddess in real life.

Zheng Zimo’s current mood was even more excited than winning five million dollars. That feeling of joy was simply indescribable.

He did not expect that his idol would look even better than on the screen.

Ye Zao was stunned. “We know each other?”

“Zheng Zimo said excitedly, “Goddess! It’s me! I’m Hammer!” ”

Awl?

“Ye Zao frowned slightly. Suddenly, he seemed to have thought of something and his eyes curved. “Heaven-toppling, earth-shattering, purple-gold hammer 1225?” ”

Even though ye Zao had not been on stream for a few days.

“However, as a loyal fan of her live stream room, she still had a very deep impression of hammer. ”

“”Yes, yes, yes!”Zheng Zimo did not expect ye Zao not only to remember him, but also 1225 behind him. “Goddess, are you here for coffee too?” ”

Ye Zao’s gaze landed on Zheng Zimo and on Feng Xianxian. “I have an appointment with this Miss Feng.”

From the moment ye Zao entered.

Feng Xianxian’s face turned green.

She did not expect Zheng Zimo and ye Zao to know each other.

“Upon hearing this, Zheng Zimo said in surprise, “Xianxian, you know my goddess?” ”

Goddess?

“Feng Xianxian’s face, which was already a little ugly, turned even uglier at this moment. ”

“Ye Zhuo was Zheng Zimo’s goddess, so what was she? ”

Didn’t Zheng Zimo like her?

Zheng Zhilan was also confused.

“As far as she knew, Zheng Zimo wasn’t the kind of person who chased after celebrities. ”

He wouldn’t easily call anyone a goddess.

Even Feng Xianxian hadn’t gotten a single word from him about being his goddess.

What was up with this young miss of the Lin Family?

“She was said to be a celebrity, but she had never seen her before... ”

How did Zheng Zimo Know Her?

“Feng Xianxian smiled and nodded. “Yes, Big Brother Zheng. I invited Miss Lin over.” ”

Miss Lin?

Zheng Zimo was stunned.

“In that case, Ye Zhuo was the young miss of the Lin family. ”

“But based on his understanding of Ye Zhuo, she had never been a scheming green tea. ”

“Upon hearing that, Zheng Zimo smiled and said, “What a coincidence! Goddess, let me introduce you. This is my sister, Zheng Zhilan. My name is Zheng Zimo. Xianxian doesn’t need me to introduce her to you, right? You all know each other.” ”

“Brother?”Zheng Zhilan raised her head and looked at Zheng Zimo.

They were clearly here to help Feng Xianxian teach ye Zao a lesson.

What was going on with Zheng Zimo Now?

“Zheng Zimo acted as if he did not see Zheng Zhilan’s gaze and turned to look at Ye Zao. “Goddess, please sit down! Oh right, goddess, what would you like to drink?” ”

“Cappuccino is fine.”

Zheng Zimo immediately waved at the waiter.

“Soon, a cappuccino was served. ”

“Zheng Zimo said excitedly, “Goddess, if Doggie knew that I saw you in real life, he would definitely die of envy!” ”

Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly. “You Know Doggie in real life?”

“I don’t know him.”Zheng Zimo shook his head. “But we added each other as friends on wechat!”

The two of them were talking about topics that Feng Xianxian and Zheng Zhilan did not understand. They could not get into the conversation even if they wanted to.

Feng Xianxian’s knuckles turned white as she held the silver spoon.

What on Earth was this?

Did Zheng Zimo still remember what he was here for?

B * Tch!

Ye Zhuo was a B * TCH.

He was just like her shameless mother. They were both so Shameless! They both liked other people’s things so much!

“Zheng Zhilan was also very angry. She looked at Zheng Zimo a lot, but Zheng Zimo still ignored her. ”

“Zheng Zhilan turned to look at Feng Xianxian. “Xianxian, do you want to go to the bathroom?” ” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Feng Xianxian nodded and followed Zheng Zhilan’s footsteps.

“When they arrived at the bathroom, Zheng Zhilan comforted Feng Xianxian, “Xianxian, don’t be angry. My brother wasn’t the kind of person who couldn’t walk when he saw beautiful women in the past. There must be a misunderstanding today! Don’t worry, you still have me! I will definitely think of a way to help you vent your anger!” ”

“Feng Xianxian smiled and held Zheng Zhilan’s hand. “I know Zhilan. I Don’t blame brother Zheng. A girl like ye Zhuo should be liked by everyone, right?” ”

Feng Xianxian paused and a self-deprecating look flashed across her eyes.

“I have no father since I was young. My mother has been living in my grandmother’s house. I have nothing. How can I compare to Ye Zhuo?”
