Old Master Jin pinched his temples. “I heard that fifth master is back?”

Uncle Fu nodded. “I think so.”

Old Master Jin narrowed his eyes as he came up with a plan.

Shunxi Financial Group.

Annie ran quickly to the office. “Miss Zhao!”

“What’s Wrong?”Zhao Xueyin looked up.

“Annie continued, “Jiang Xiaoyu is here!” ”

Jiang Xiaoyu.

Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes. Her eyes were full of sarcasm.

She knew Jiang Xiaoyu would definitely come.

Jiang Xiaoyu did not disappoint her.

Zhao Xueyin took out the box of medicine from the drawer.

“At this moment, there was a knock on the door. ”

It must be Jiang Xiaoyu!

Annie immediately ran to open the door.

“Zhao Xueyin said, “Wait a moment.” ”

Annie turned around in confusion.

“Let her wait first.”

She should act like she was begging someone.

Annie nodded.

The knocking on the door continued.

It was not until three minutes later that Zhao Xueyin asked Annie to open the door.

“Is Miss Zhao busy?”The R & D Manager asked while holding the documents.

Annie was stunned.

It wasn’t Jiang Xiaoyu?

Annie quickly reacted. “Miss Zhao is inside. Come in quickly.”

The R & D Manager walked in with the documents.

“When she saw the R & D manager, Zhao Xueyin frowned. ”

“”Miss Zhao, these documents need your signature.” ”

Zhao Xueyin lowered her head and signed the documents.

“After the R & D Manager left, Zhao Xueyin looked at Annie. “Didn’t you say Jiang Xiaoyu was here?” ”

Annie was also very curious. “I clearly saw her go up to the 58th floor just now.”

“Go and check it out.”

“Okay.”Annie nodded.

“About ten minutes later, Annie returned with a complicated expression on her face. ”

“What happened?”Zhao Xueyin asked.

“Annie said, “Miss, Miss Zhao, the Jiang Financial Group has found a new backer.” ”

“What?”Zhao Xueyin stood up from her chair.

“Who is it?”Zhao Xueyin continued to ask.

“Other than her, who else would dare to take over the Jiang Corporation’s mess? ”

“Annie hesitated for a moment and then said, “Yes, yes, it’s President Ye.” ”

Ye Zhuo?

“With just ye Zhuo alone, she still wanted to bring the Jiang Corporation out of its predicament? ”

In her dreams!

“Hearing these words, Zhao Xueyin’s eyes were filled with ridicule. ” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Did Ye Zao really think that she was someone important?

She didn’t even consider how much she weighed!

“However, this action just happened to fulfill her wish. ”

Ye Zao was currently very popular in the Shunxi Financial Group. She was worried that she wouldn’t be able to catch ye Zao.

“The Jiang Financial Group’s losses were too great. They were no different from an empty shell now. If she wasn’t careful, she would be dragged into this mess. ”

“At that time, Jiang Xiaoyu would not be the only one who begged her. ”

Ye Zhuo would also have to kneel on the ground and beg her obediently!

“Thinking of this, Zhao Xueyin’s face was full of joy, and her tone was still gentle. “Then I want to see how ye Zhuo will turn the tide and pull the Jiang Financial Group out of the mud.” ”

At most one week.

“At that time, Ye Zhuo would definitely come and beg her. ”

...

On the other side.

“After watching the drama, Granny Zhou went shopping with a few older sisters. ”

“”Old Madam Zhou!”At this moment, a familiar voice suddenly sounded behind her. ”

Granny Zhou turned around and saw that it was Auntie Wang.

“Auntie Wang!”Granny Zhou said in surprise.

“Auntie Wang smiled and said, “Old Madam, I really didn’t expect to see you here!” ”

“”I didn’t expect it either.”Grandma Zhou continued, “Didn’t you say that you moved?” ”

“”No! Who told you that?”Auntie Wang said, “I’ve always lived here.” ”

“Grandma Zhou was stunned for a moment. “Then maybe Jiayue made a mistake! By the way, how was the matter with your lover resolved last time? Did Ye Zhuo compensate you? If she doesn’t compensate you, tell me, and I’ll make the decision for you!” ”

“It was said that the people could not win against the officials, and the poor could not win against the rich. ”

Granny Zhou was not afraid of Ye Zhuo!

“With her backing for Auntie Wang, she would definitely be able to get justice for Auntie Wang. ”

“Granny Zhou thought that after she said these words, Auntie Wang would definitely be very grateful to her, but she did not expect.., auntie Wang actually said with a puzzled look, “Compensate? Compensate for what? Old Madam, you might have made a mistake! President ye is our family’s great benefactor, we can’t even thank her in time!” ”

Great benefactor?

Mother-in-law Zhou frowned.

Could it be that ye Zhuo had already given money to sister-in-law Wang?

“Sister-in-law Wang continued, “Old Madam, you still don’t know, right! It was all because of President Ye’s prescription that my wife recovered so quickly! We went to the hospital for a check-up. The Doctor said that my wife’s body has completely recovered and she will be like a normal person in the future.” ”

What?

Recovered?

Just like normal.

Auntie Wang’s wife actually recovered?

How was that possible!

She heard it wrong.

She must have heard it wrong.

Ma Jiayue had clearly told her that Auntie Wang had resigned because her husband’s condition had worsened. How could he possibly recover?

“”By the way, Old Madam, this is my wife, Su Qiang. This is my daughter, Su Xiaoqing.”Auntie Wang then introduced Su Qiang and Su Xiaoqing to Granny Zhou. ”

“Su Qiang said, “Hello, Old Lady.” ”

Su Xiaoqing also followed behind to say hello.

Granny Zhou was stunned.

“Looking at Su Qiang’s appearance, he really did not look like a diabetic. ”

Which diabetic could carry so many things?

What on Earth was going on?

“Granny Zhou could not react for a moment. She looked at Auntie Wang and said, “Since your wife has already recovered, why did you resign?” ”

“”Resign? I didn’t resign! Old Madam, when I was working at Your House, you were so good to me. Why would I resign! Even if I wanted to resign, I would have told you in advance! How could you leave without saying anything?”Auntie Wang continued, “It was madam who said that there were too many servants in the house, so she didn’t allow me to come over! I wanted to go and say hello to You, but the housekeeper said that you weren’t at home during this period of time, so I didn’t go.” ”

“Granny Zhou stood rooted to the ground, her face alternating between green and white. ”

“At this point, she already understood what was going on. ”

There was no problem with ye Zhuo’s prescription.

The problem was Ma Jiayue.

“Thinking of her words and actions towards ye Zhuo in the theater, Granny Zhou’s face burned with pain, as if she had been slapped a few times. ”

It was her fault.

It was all her fault!

“If it wasn’t for her distrust of Ye Zhuo, she would be the one who had recovered! ”
