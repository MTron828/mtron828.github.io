Little Half Moon glanced at Xi Muwen and then at XI Weiyue who was not far away before she walked over to Xi Muwen with a trembling body.

She did not dare not go.

“After staying at the Xi family for a few days, other than eating and sleeping, she had experienced a lot of beatings and curses. ”

Especially XI Weiyue.

“Her attacks were ruthless and accurate, and she did not even leave any scars on her body. ”

“Xi Muwen held Little Half Moon’s hand, with a fatherly expression, he said, “Little Half Moon, let me introduce you. This is your mother. She’s been looking for you for many years. Back then, she didn’t mean to lose you on purpose. All these years, she’s also very guilty. For You, her hair turned white overnight. Can you call her ‘mother’?” ”

Xi Muwen purposely changed the topic to Auntie Lang losing little half moon so that she would feel even more guilty and not have the energy to think about other things.

“If ye Langhua had not lost little half moon, would little half Moon have become like this? ”

All of this was ye Langhua’s fault.

Ye Langhua should live with endless guilt and self-blame.

“Little Half Moon looked up at Aunt Lang and was so scared that she grabbed Xi Muwen’s hand tightly. Her lips trembled as she said, “Don’t hit me, don’t hit me... I’ll be obedient. I’ll be obedient in the future. Please don’t hit me...” ” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Xi Muwen sighed. His eyes were filled with heartache. “I wonder how much this child has suffered. If it’s possible, I’d rather live thirty years less to ease your pain...” ”

“After a long while, Aunt Lang looked up at Xi Muwen. “Is she really half a month old?” ”

“Aunt Lang had been too emotional earlier. She hadn’t even noticed that there was nothing similar between half a month’s brows. Now, she realized something was wrong. ”

Xi Muwen narrowed his eyes when he heard this.

Ye Langhua didn’t believe him.

“Fortunately, he had made preparations beforehand. ”

“Xi Muwen held Little Half Moon’s hand and walked in front of Aunt Lang. “Langhua, I remember that you have a small red mole on your hand. Take a look, this child also has one on her hand.” ”

Aunt Lang looked down and indeed saw the same red mole.

“Xu Jiao said, “Sister, Little Half Moon has suffered too much outside. When we first found her, there wasn’t a single good spot on her body. Look at her forehead, it’s all beaten up here!” ”

Xu Jiao lifted Little Half Moon’s forehead when she said the last sentence.

“Without the cover of her hair, she could clearly see a very obvious scar under her forehead. ”

“Xi Muwen then got someone to bring over a paternity test. “If these still can’t prove that she’s little half moon, this is the paternity test between me and Little Half Moon. Take a look.” ”

Aunt Lang reached out to take the paternity test.

The paternity test showed that the two of them were indeed related.

Could this really be her half a month old?

“Yang Jiao continued, “Sister, how about this? We’ll go to the hospital to do another paternity test for you and half a month old. This will be safer.” ”

“Okay.”Aunt Lang nodded.

“”Then let’s Go Now! Since the technology is advanced now, the paternity test report will be out very soon!” ”

The family headed to the hospital.

“While waiting for the report to be out, Aunt Lang was very nervous. She did not know if this person was really her little half moon. ”

“In her lifetime, would she be able to reunite with her daughter. ”

“Xi Weiyue sat beside Aunt Lang and held Aunt Lang’s hand. “Aunt, don’t worry. The report will be out soon.” ”

“On the other side, Little Half Moon was making a ruckus. Yang Jiao bought a lollipop to coax her. ”

“At that moment, the office door opened. ”

Aunt Lang stood up immediately. “How’s The Doctor? Is She Really My Daughter?”

“The Doctor held the report. “According to the results, that lady is indeed your daughter.” ”

“Aunt Lang’s hands trembled as she read the report. Hot tears almost burst out of her eyes, staining the report in black and white. ”

It was her daughter.

It really was her daughter.

Xi Muwen walked over to Aunt Lang’s side. “You should be at ease now.”

“Aunt Lang hugged little half moon and cried, “Little Half Moon, I’ve finally found you. It’s been thirty-six years. I thought I’d never see you again!” ”

Little Half Moon was scared out of her wits. She kept nagging her not to hit her.

“”Don’t worry, if I don’t hit you, I won’t hit you...” ”

“Xi Weiyue walked over and smiled. “Aunty, Congratulations on finally finding sister Half Moon. This isn’t the place to talk. Let’s go back first.” ”

“Aunty Lang nodded. “Go back, let’s go back first.” ”

“During the conversation, Aunty Lang held Little Half Moon’s hand tightly, unwilling to let go. She was afraid that if she let go, she would lose Little Half Moon again. ”
