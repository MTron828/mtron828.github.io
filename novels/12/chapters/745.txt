What?

What did Lin Qingxuan Mean?

Old Lady Lin looked at Lin Qingxuan in disbelief. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Before Old Lady Lin could react, Lin Qingxuan held Xia Xiaoman’s hand. The two of them knelt on the ground and kowtowed to Old Lady Lin. ”

“After kowtowing, Lin Qingxuan did not say anything else. He held Xia Xiaoman’s hand and walked out. ”

Xia Xiaoman was stunned the whole time.

She didn’t expect Lin Qingxuan to do this.

“Are... are we leaving just like this?”Xia Xiaoman asked.

“Lin Qingxuan nodded. “I listened to my mother for half of my life. For the rest of my life, I want to live for myself.”In the first half of his life, he was with Zhao shuning because of Old Lady Lin. ”

“Every night when he dreamt about it, he felt extremely uncomfortable. ”

“Because of Zhao Shuning’s lie, he felt guilty for most of his life. In the middle of it, he even suffered from depression. ”

No one knew how he had survived for so many years.

“Now, Old Lady Lin was using the same trick again. He really did not want to endure it anymore. ”

He had to give himself an explanation and give Xia Xiaoman an an explanation.

“Xia Xiaoman was still a little worried. “Then your mother, she...” ”

“Lin Qingxuan continued, “This is her own choice. No one forced her. When she comes back in a hundred years, we can send her to her death.”Originally, he could have been with Xia Xiaoman to properly show filial piety to Old Lady Lin. ”

But Old Lady Lin insisted on torturing her.

“This time, Lin Qingxuan was really tired and really hurt by Old Lady Lin. ”

“If he didn’t make this decision, Old Lady Lin would definitely go on and on. ”

“If this went on, he and Xia Xiaoman wouldn’t have to live anymore. ”

“Looking at the backs of Lin Qingxuan and Xia Xiaoman, Old Lady Lin didn’t even have time to put on her shoes and immediately chased after them, “Qingxuan! Lin Qingxuan! Come back here! Don’t tell me that you don’t even want your own mother for this woman?” ”

“Lin Qingxuan!”

Old Mrs. Lin continued to scream at the top of her lungs.

Unfortunately.

She didn’t make Lin Qingxuan turn back.

“Seeing Lin Qingxuan’s back disappear into the green plants in front of her, old Mrs. Lin collapsed to the ground and wailed loudly. ”

“Auntie Wang followed them. She didn’t know how to persuade Old Mrs. Lin, so she had to pull old Mrs. Lin up from the ground. ”

“Lin Qingxuan and Xia Xiaoman did not leave immediately. Instead, they made a trip to the east wing. ”

Lin Jincheng and Ye Shu were both at home.

“Seeing that Lin Qingxuan and Xia Xiaoman’s expressions were a little strange, Ye Shu hurriedly went up to them. “Fourth brother and fourth sister-in-law, why are you here?” ”

Lin Jincheng also stood up. “Fourth brother and fourth sister-in-law.”

“Lin Qingxuan did not beat around the bush and went straight to the point. “Jincheng, fifth sister-in-law, I have broken off my mother-son relationship...” ”

Lin Jin Cheng’s expression changed. “What happened?”

“Although he knew that the outcome of this matter would not be too good, Lin Jin Cheng never thought that he would walk the path of breaking off their relationship. ”

Lin Qingxuan told him what had happened.

“Although Lin Jin Cheng was very surprised, he could understand. After all, he was also one of the victims. ”

“If it was not for Old Lady Lin’s extreme actions, Lin Qingxuan would definitely not have chosen to break off their relationship. ”

“Lin Jincheng continued, “Fourth brother, what do you plan to do in the future?” ”

“Lin Qingxuan said, “Xiao Man and I are already at this age. In the next few days, we plan to take a round-the-world trip. When we return from the trip, we should be able to settle down in the capital. If Xiao Man is willing, we might also be able to settle down abroad. We haven’t made any plans yet.” ”

Lin Jincheng nodded.

“After saying that, Lin Qingxuan continued, “During this period of time, I’ll leave Lizi to you and the fifth brother and sister to help take care of her.” ”

“Lin Jincheng smiled and said, “Don’t worry about that. If Lizi is willing, let her move in with searing flames. In any case, she and searing flames are good sisters to begin with.” ”

“”Jincheng, thank you.” ”

“Lin Jincheng patted Lin Qingxuan on the shoulder. “We’re all family. Fourth brother, what are you talking about! Right, fourth brother, don’t you still need to inform eldest brother, second brother, and third brother about this?” ”

The Lin family’s brothers were more amiable. He believed that they should be able to understand Lin Qingxuan.

“Lin Qingxuan nodded. “Jincheng, you’re very thoughtful. You should inform them.” ”

West courtyard.

“Ever since Lin Qingxuan left, Old Lady Lin had been lying on the bed, coughing non-stop. ”

She felt sick!

Really Sick!

“Lin Qingxuan was the son that she had raised, a piece of flesh that had fallen from her body. But now, Lin Qingxuan wanted to break off relations with her for a woman! ”
