“Zhou cuihua cried, “Brother! Brother! I’m your only sister, you can’t treat me like this!” ”

Zhou Xiatian didn’t say anything else and turned to leave.

“Zhou cuihua followed Zhou Xiatian’s footsteps and Sun Guixiang immediately reached out to stop Zhou cuihua, “Do you not understand human language or what! Didn’t you hear what our old Zhou said?” ”

“After saying that, Sun Guixiang slammed the door shut. ”

Zhou cuihua looked at the tightly shut door and could not help but cry like rain.

She regretted it.

She really regretted it.

She regretted that she had gone too far and did not leave any way out for herself.

“Now that things had come to this, where should she go? ”

“Zhou cuihua leaned against the door and shouted, “Brother and sister-in-law, I was wrong! I really know I was wrong. Please forgive me!” ”

There was no sound from inside

“Brother! Sister-in-law!”

Inside the house.

Zhou Xiatian was cooking in the kitchen.

“Sun Guixiang stood beside Zi and looked at him. She said hesitantly, “Old Zhou, should we... Should we forget about it?” ”

“At this point, she sighed. “No matter what, she’s still your sister. Moreover, when she divorced Li Dalong, she didn’t ask for anything. She probably has nowhere to go now. It’s quite pitiful.” ”

Sun Guixiang also had her own thoughts.

“After all, she had a good-for-nothing younger brother. ”

“This bowl of water had to be even, right? ”

What if that good-for-nothing younger brother of hers came over one day and Zhou Xiatian talked about Zhou Cuihua’s matter?

“Fortunately, although her younger brother wasn’t good-for-nothing, he wasn’t as heartless as Zhou Cuihua. ”

Zhou Xiatian focused on cooking and didn’t say anything.

“Sun guixiang continued, “Old Zhou, did you hear what I Said?” ”

Zhou Xiatian then looked up at Sun Guixiang. “Speak.”

“Sun Guixiang continued, “Your sister is still your sister. The two of you share the same blood. Why Don’t we just forget about it? We adults are magnanimous. Don’t lower ourselves to her level.” ”

“When she heard this, Zhou Xiatian did not have any special expression on her face. She only said, “I’ve said it before. From now on, she has nothing to do with me.” ”

“Are you serious?”Sun Guixiang asked.

“Yes.”Zhou Xiatian nodded.

“Good words warm the heart for three winters, but harsh words hurt the heart for six months. ”

“Zhou cuihua had thoroughly disappointed Zhou Xiatian. He had thought a lot these days, and he would never regret making this decision. ”

“”Then let’s make a deal. You were the one who insisted on having nothing to do with your sister. If anything happens in the future, you can’t blame me!”Sun Guixiang added. ”

“There were some things that had to be made clear. Even if it was a husband and wife, there was no need to make things unclear. ” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“I won’t blame you.”Zhou Xiatian continued to cook.

Sun Guixiang nodded. “Alright then.”

“After saying that, Sun Guixiang turned to look outside the door. She couldn’t tell what was in her eyes. ”

Zhou cuihua had completely brought this upon herself. There was nothing to sympathize with.

“Zhou cuihua just sat outside the door, tears trickling down from the corners of her eyes. ”

“After a while, Zhou Cuihua stood up and walked downstairs. ”

“She thought that Zhou Xiatian would definitely help her, but she didn’t expect... ”

“Now that her family had no conscience, even if she stayed here for a day and a night, nothing would change. ”

“Auntie!”

“At this moment, a surprised male voice came from behind Zhou Cuihua. ”

“Xiaowen!”Zhou cuihua turned her head and saw a youth wearing a basketball uniform.

“The youth wore black rimmed glasses. Not only did he not appear dull, but he was also extremely bright. Zhou Xiatian’s figure could be seen in his eyes. ”

That’s right.

“This was Zhou Xiatian’s son, Zhou Xiaowen. ”

“”Aunt, when did you come? Why didn’t you come in?” ”

“Zhou cuihua immediately wiped away the tears at the corner of her eyes and pretended as if nothing had happened. She smiled and said, “Oh, it seems like there’s no one here.” ”

“No One?”Zhou Xiaowen was stunned. “How can that be! I just called my dad. They’re all at home!”

“As soon as he said that, Zhou Xiaowen pulled Zhou Cuihua’s arm and said, “Let’s go, Auntie, let’s go home.” ”

Go home.

“When she heard this word, Zhou Cuihua’s eyes turned red for a moment. ”

Home?

Did she really still have a home?

Did she still have a home to go back to?

“The road ahead was long, where was her home? ”

“Zhou cuihua pulled her arm back and smiled. “Xiaowen, I still have other things to do, so I won’t be going. Please send my regards to your parents.” ”

“After saying that, Zhou cuihua left in a hurry. ”

“Aunt!”

“Zhou Xiaowen looked at Zhou Cuihua’s back, his eyes filled with confusion. ”
