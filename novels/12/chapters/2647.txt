“Feng Juan smiled and said, “It’s nothing. It’s just pregnancy vomiting. Every woman will experience it. There’s nothing to make a fuss about.” ”

“After saying that, Feng Juan washed her hands and rinsed her mouth before continuing, “Who were you talking to just now? I didn’t disturb you, did I?” ”

“”No, no,”Li Dalong continued, “It was hang hang who called. Zhou Cuihua was in a car accident. I heard that the situation was quite dangerous.” ”

“Hearing this, Feng Juan’s face turned pale, “Then, should we go and take a look?”? “Although Zhou Cuihua went overboard in the past and hang hang has also disappointed you, they are now in trouble after all. Some things have already passed, so let it pass. Da long, don’t dwell on the past anymore!” ”

“Once Feng Juan said this, Li Da Long’s heart felt very uncomfortable. He immediately recalled what had happened before. ”

Li Hang was willing to forsake him as his father for the sake of the rich and powerful.

Zhou cuihua was even more heartless.

Retribution.

This was all their retribution.

“”What are you looking at?”Li da long continued, “This is their retribution for disliking the poor and loving the rich! Regardless of whether they live or die, I will not take another look at them!” ”

“Feng Juan said, “Da Long, forget about Zhou Cuihua. Hang Hang is different. Hang Hang is your biological flesh and blood!” ”

“”Biological flesh and blood? I treat her as my biological flesh and blood. What does she treat me as? Does she treat me as her biological father?”Li Dalong looked at Feng Juan, “Juan ‘er, good people will not be rewarded well! Why Are You So Kind? If you treat them well, they will think that you are a fool! Juan ‘er, in the future, only you and the child will be my lover and Family!” ”

“Some things were fine if they were forgotten, but if they were not forgotten, the more they thought about it, the angrier they would get. ”

“For example, the current Li Dalong. ”

“Seeing Li Dalong like this, Feng Juan heaved a sigh of relief, but she still said, “Dalong, you can’t say that. Zhou Cuihua is about to die now, and hang hang will be alone in the future. It’s quite pitiful. Why don’t we bring her over!” ”

“I’ve said it before. She will never be my daughter again!”Li Dalong looked very determined.

“Feng Juan continued, “Dalong! Don’t do anything that you’ll regret.”Although she hadn’t been with Li Dalong for long, Feng Juan understood Li Dalong too well. He was a good person! ”

He was exactly the same as her in the past. She was always on the path of suffering or suffering.

“After experiencing a failed marriage, Feng Juan had grown up a lot, but Li Dalong seemed to be stuck in the same spot, and many things had to be reminded of by others. ”

“Li dalong continued, “Only by bringing her over will I truly regret it!”After saying that, Li Dalong pulled Feng Juan into his embrace. “Juan ‘er, from now on, the three of us can just live our own lives. Don’t think too much about it.” ”

“”There’s something I haven’t told you,”Feng Juan said. ”

“What is it?”Li Dalong asked.

“Feng Juan continued, “I’m pregnant with twins. The doctor only called me to inform me.” ”

“Hearing that, Li Dalong said in surprise, “Really?” ”

Feng Juan nodded.

“Then why didn’t you tell me earlier?”Li Dalong was ecstatic.

“Feng Juan said, “I want to give you a surprise.” ”

“Li Da long smiled and said, “In that case, we will be a family of four from now on?” ”

“Yes.”Feng Juan nodded.

Li Da Long was very happy and kissed Feng Juan a few times.

Li hang was very unwilling and called Li da long again. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Li Da long quickly picked up, but his attitude had obviously changed. ”

“”Li Hang, we don’t have any relationship now. Whether Zhou cuihua lives or dies has nothing to do with me. Don’t call me again in the future.” ”

“Before Li Hang could say anything, Li Dalong hung up the phone. ”

“Li hang dialed again, but it was already busy. ”

It was blocked.

Li Dalong had actually blocked her.

Why?

They were father and daughter!

Who would have thought that a father and daughter whose blood was thicker than water would one day come to this point.

Li hang wished he could just throw his phone away.

But he couldn’t.

She was already in a tight spot. It wasn’t worth it to buy a broken phone again.

“At this moment, she could only silently accept the injustice of fate. ”

Li Hang walked into the hospital in a daze.

“Now he could only pray to God to bless Zhou cuihua. The wicked still needed the wicked to torture them. He had to quickly make Zhou cuihua recover, and then let Zhou cuihua deal with Li Dalong and Feng Juan, that slut! ”

“At this moment, Li Hang’s phone suddenly rang. ”

Was It Li Dalong?

“Li hang immediately picked up the phone, but the doctor’s voice came from the other end. “Is this Zhou Cuihua’s family member, Li Hang?” ”

“I am.”

A voice came from the other end. “Zhou Cuihua’s physical signs are declining. Quickly come and see her one last time.”
