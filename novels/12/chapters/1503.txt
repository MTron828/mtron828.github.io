What’s wrong with Chinese medicine?

Is Chinese medicine that amazing?

“If ye Zhuo’s medical skills were really that good, why didn’t he diagnose that Xia Xiaoman had taken birth control pills? ”

“If he couldn’t even diagnose her, it was just a sniff. What other reason could it be? ”

“Sun Jiayi held onto Auntie Sun’s arm and said in a low voice, “Mom, it’s fine! Don’t worry! That authentic Miss Lin definitely won’t find anything wrong with the pills.” ”

“Auntie Sun was still a little worried and continued, “Xia Xiaoman has been taking birth control pills for such a long time. It’s only been a day. There shouldn’t be any problems, right?”Xia Xiaoman was old and it wasn’t easy for her to get pregnant, in addition to taking birth control pills for a long time, how could she get pregnant so easily? ” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“”Mom, what if she gets pregnant?”Sun Jiayi was very worried. “Don’t tell me you want to joke about your daughter’s future?” ”

“Once Xia Xiaoman was pregnant with Lin Qingxuan’s child, she would have no hope at all. ”

“Although Xia Xiaoman was already half-old and had no good looks or figure, Lin Qingxuan liked her very much. ”

“As the saying goes, a mother’s son is precious. ”

“If she wanted to kick Xia Xiaoman out of the Lin family completely, she had to be a mother’s son. ”

“Therefore, she had to be pregnant with Lin Jincheng’s child. She couldn’t let Xia Xiaoman have the slightest chance of getting pregnant. ”

“Auntie Sun frowned. “But if we’re discovered this time, we won’t be able to bear the consequences!” ”

Auntie Sun was a very cautious and careful person.

“Seeing Auntie Sun like this, Sun Jiayi was almost speechless. “Mom, don’t worry! Nothing will happen!” ”

“No.”Auntie Sun shook her head. “I’m still a little worried.”

“Sun Jiayi continued, “Think about how old ye Zhuo is? You’ve said it yourself, she’s only 20 years old this year! What does a little girl who’s only 20 years old know? I don’t think she knows anything about medicine! If she knew medicine, wouldn’t she be able to diagnose that Xia Xiaoman had taken birth control pills? Think about it, what would I do if Xia Xiaoman was pregnant? Wouldn’t I become a joke then?” ”

“With that said, Auntie Sun felt that what Sun Jiayi said made sense. ”

“Ye Zhuo was still young, what medical skills could he have? ”

“If Xia Xiaoman got pregnant this time, what would happen to the mother and daughter? ”

She still hoped that Sun Jiayi would take the position of Mrs. Lin and glorify the ancestors!

“Therefore, she couldn’t give Xia Xiaoman any chance to get pregnant! ”

“Thinking of this, Auntie Sun narrowed her eyes. “Okay, I know.” ”

“”Then mom, don’t Forget!”Sun Jiayi instructed. ”

“Don’t worry.”

“At this moment, the Butler walked over. Auntie sun smiled and said, “Jiayi, today is Miss’s birthday. There are many honored guests in the villa. You must be careful. Don’t offend the honored guests.” ”

“Sun Jiayi was stunned. He didn’t understand why Auntie Sun suddenly said that. He turned his head and saw the butler coming over. He immediately nodded. “Mom, I understand.” ”

“”Okay, then you should quickly go to work! See if Miss has any instructions!”Auntie Sun said. ”

“”Okay.”Sun Jiayi continued, “Then I’ll go over First!” ”

“Go ahead.”

“Sun Jiayi turned around and walked in the direction of the front hall. Just then, she met the butler. “Hello, Uncle Wang.” ”

“The butler nodded and said with a smile, “Okay.” ”

“From the Butler’s point of view, Sun Jiayi had been taught very well by Auntie Sun. When she saw people, she took the initiative to greet them. She was usually very diligent in her work, unlike some people who just wanted to slack off! ”

“Not only did Sun Jiayi not slack off, but she also took the initiative to help the other servants in the house work together. Therefore, the butler still admired this little girl very much. ”

“Butler.”Auntie Sun also greeted the butler.

“The Butler walked over and said, “Auntie Sun, Jiayi, this child, is really not bad.” ”

“Auntie sun smiled and said, “It’s nothing. You’re flattering her too much.” ”

“Are you going to brew medicine for your wife?”The Butler continued to ask.

“Yes.”Auntie Sun nodded.

“The butler said, “Coincidentally, I have something to do in the kitchen. Let’s go together.” ”

“Okay.”Auntie Sun followed the butler’s footsteps.

“The housekeeper continued, “Oh right, Auntie Sun, has Jiayi found a boyfriend at school?” ”

“Auntie Sun shook her head. “She didn’t tell me. I’m not too sure either! She’s already in university now. It’s her freedom to find a boyfriend or not. As parents, we don’t want to interfere too much.” ”

“”You’re right. Children nowadays all have their own opinions.”The housekeeper deliberated over the words in his heart and continued, “It’s like this. You should know about the dessert chef, master Feng, right?” ”

“I know.”Auntie Sun nodded.
