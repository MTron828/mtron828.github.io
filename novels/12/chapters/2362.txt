Shangguan Jun was quite happy now.

“At first, he was a little anxious. If Lin Ze was a scheming person, how could he continue to stay in the Shangguan family. ”

“Although his surname was Shangguan, he was not related to the Shangguan family in the end. ”

“Once the new heir took over, there were many reasons to kick him out. ”

“After all, he was the new heir’s most advantageous competitor. ”

“Since ancient times, any competitor who posed a threat to the monarch would be silenced. ”

“He did not have the blood of the Shangguan family on him. Even if he was silenced, no one would stand up for him. ”

“But now, he was not worried at all. ”

The most important thing for him now was to wait.

Wait for Lin Ze to officially take over the Shangguan family and wait for Lin Ze to make a mistake.

“At that time, even if he didn’t do anything, someone would naturally compare him to Lin Ze. ”

“When the time came, Lin Ze would naturally be chased out. ”

Lin Ze’s height today would determine how badly he would fall in the future.

“Zhao Lianxin looked at Shangguan Jun and said, “Brother Jun, have you seen Lin Ze?” ”

“Yes.”Shangguan jun nodded.

“How is Lin Ze?”Zhao Lianxin asked.

“She had just arrived and had not gone to the wedding scene to take a look. She had not seen Lin Ze, so she was quite curious about Lin Ze. ”

What kind of person would be selected by the old lady of Shangguan City.

The old lady of Shangguan city was old-fashioned and serious. Even the outstanding Shangguan Jun could hardly get any praise from the old lady.

“”Very good,”shangguan jun continued, “Otherwise, the old lady would not have taken a fancy to you.” ”

“Lin Ze was definitely a good grandson, but he was definitely not a good successor. ”

“Zhao Lianxin looked at Shangguan Jun, his eyes full of heartache. He wanted to say something, but he did not know how to say it. ”

“Over the years, Shangguan Jun had done a lot for the Shangguan family. He was about to become the successor of the Shangguan family, but who knew... ”

“Zhao Lianxin had grown up with Shangguan Jun since they were young. They were childhood sweethearts. Seeing Shangguan Jun like this, Zhao Lianxin’s heart really ached. ”

Especially when he heard Shangguan Jun say that Lin Ze was very good.

“Shangguan Jun saw through Zhao Lianxin’s worries and said with a smile, “Lianxin, I’m really fine. You Don’t have to do this. Not only do I feel nothing, I’m actually very happy.” ”

“Zhao lianxin sighed. “Brother Jun, if you want to cry, just cry. Don’t worry, I won’t laugh at you.” ”

“After saying that, Zhao lianxin continued, “Don’t be embarrassed. Who’s with whom?” ”

“Shangguan Jun chuckled. “Lianxin, do you think I’m the kind of person who will force myself?” ”

Never.

“Seeing him like this, Zhao Lianxin did not say anything more. He continued, “Brother Jun, are we really going out to eat?” ”

“Yes.”Shangguan jun nodded.

“Zhao lianxin said hesitantly, “Then, will your grandmother be angry?” ”

“No matter what, today was Lin Ze’s Big Day. ”

And Lin Ze was the successor that Old Lady Shangguan had personally chosen.

“Shangguan jun smiled and said, “Don’t worry, my grandmother doesn’t have time to be angry with us today.” ”

“Old Lady Shangguan was currently busy with Lin Ze’s matters, and Lin Ze had just come to the Shangguan residence. The old lady naturally looked at Lin Ze in every way. ”

“Even if she knew, she would not be angry. ”

“Hearing Shangguan Jun’s words, Zhao lianxin heaved a sigh of relief and said with a smile, “Alright.” ”

“Alright.”

Shangguan residence.

The wedding process was quickly completed.

Lin Ze held Bai Jingshu’s hand and toasted her from table to table.

“Bai Jingshu was dressed in a wine-red toasting outfit and had exquisite makeup on. Standing among the crowd, she looked especially outstanding and beautiful. ”

“Looking at her, the two of them were a perfect couple. ”

“Old Lady Shangguan turned to look at Ye Shu, her eyes filled with envy. “Mrs. Lin, you’ve given birth to a good pair of children.” ”

“Her daughter was Miss Ye, who was famous throughout the country of Yue. ”

Her son was not inferior either. He was full of talent at such a young age.

Old Lady Shangguan was not a muddle-headed person. There were two reasons why she allowed Lin ze to become the heir of the Shangguan family.

“One was because Lin ze really looked like Shangguan Yue, and two was because Lin ze really had great talent. ”

“Old Lady Shangguan believed that when the time came, Lin Ze would definitely be able to make everyone’s eyes light up. ”

“If it was just because Lin ze looked like Shangguan Yue, then Lin ze would not be able to take this position. After all, the F galaxy was so big, and there were many people who looked like Shangguan Yue. ”

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “Thanks for the old lady’s love. In fact, these two children mainly worked hard on their own. “Speaking of which, it’s also a shame. I only met Jiao Jiao when she was eighteen. As for Ah Ze, he was even later than Jiao Jiao. As a mother, I was a failure. I did not participate in their growth and did not play a guiding role.”Ye Shu had never thought of herself as a qualified mother. ”
