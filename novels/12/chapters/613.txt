“Chapter 614: 146: a forceful slap to the face. This is my boyfriend, Cen Shaoqing. Feng Xianxian was dumbfounded! 8”

The young man was very honest and had a decent appearance.

“Ye Zhuo shook his head. “Dad, stop guessing. When I bring him back the day after tomorrow, you’ll know who he is!” ”

Lin Jincheng felt uncomfortable. “You really can’t Tell Dad?”

“It’s a secret for now.”

“Seeing that he couldn’t get anything out of him, Lin Jincheng didn’t insist. “Then I’ll go back to my room first. Zhuozhuo, you should rest early.” ”

“Good night.”

“After Lin Jincheng left, Ye Zhuo sent a message to CEN Shaoqing. [ are you asleep? ] ”

“Cen Shaoqing had his own biological clock. Every night, when it was ten o’clock, he had to go to sleep. ”

“However, when he heard the voice on Wechat, he opened his eyes immediately. At this point, other than ye Zhuo, no one else dared to send him a wechat message. ”

“He picked up his phone, and sure enough, it was ye Zhuo who sent him a message. ”

“Cen Shaoqing sat up from the bed. [ reporting to the leader, not sleeping. ] ” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“[ the day after tomorrow is my grandmother’s birthday... So, do you want to meet the parents with me? ] ”

Meet the parents?

“When he saw these three words, Cen Shaoqing thought that he was seeing things. He looked at them seriously for dozens of seconds, but the words in front of him did not change. Only then did he dare to confirm that he was not mistaken. ”

He could really meet his parents!

“Cen Shaoqing: [ so, can my internship as a leader end? ] ”

“Ye Zhuo: [ one is different. If you want to end your internship, you have to deal with My Family First. ] ”

Cen Shaoqing: [ I promise to complete the mission and not let down the expectations of the leader! ]

“Ye Zhuo: [ just a reminder, my parents and my brother still don’t know about our relationship. Remember to perform well. ] ”

“Even after replying to Ye Zhuo’s message, Cen Shaoqing was a little confused. ”

He did not expect ye Zhuo to bring him to meet his parents so soon.

At the same time.

He was still a little flustered.

He was afraid that he would not be able to handle his future father-in-law and brother-in-law.

Especially that brother-in-law whom he had offended before.

“He had been dreaming these past few nights, and he could always dream of the scene of him holding his future brother-in-law in the swimming pool to wash up. ”

“When he woke up, he was covered in sweat. ”

Cen Shaoqing suddenly lost all his sleepiness and searched on his phone: [ how can I leave a good impression on my girlfriend’s family when I meet them for the first time? ]

[ what if my brother-in-law holds a grudge? ]

[ what kind of son-in-law does my father-in-law like? ]

“On the other side, Lin Jincheng returned to his bedroom in a daze. ”

“Seeing him like this, ye Shu asked curiously, “What’s Wrong?” ”

Lin Jincheng looked at ye Shu and felt an indescribable feeling in his heart. “Ah Shu... our daughter has fallen in love.”

“Really?”Ye Shu was also stunned. “Who’s That Boy?”

“It couldn’t be Cen Shaoqing, right? ”

“Other than Cen Shaoqing, Ye Shu couldn’t think of a suitable candidate. ”

“Lin Jincheng continued, “I don’t know who the man is either. I asked searing, and searing said to keep it a secret.” ”

“Since ye Zhuo had already said to keep it a secret, Ye Shu did not mention anything about Cen Shaoqing. What if it wasn’t Cen Shaoqing? ”

Wouldn’t there be a mistake?

“That night, Lin Jincheng and ye Shu chatted for a long time. ”

“In the blink of an eye, it was the day of the birthday banquet. ”

“Although Old Lady Lin did not celebrate her birthday, many people came to congratulate her. A few sons, sons, and daughters-in-law also came with their families. ”

“Inside and outside the Lin family, there were lights and decorations. It was a joyous scene. ”

The Birthday Banquet was held in the evening.

Feng Qianhua and Feng Xianxian were dressed to the nines.

“When she learned that ye Zao had promised to bring his boyfriend to Old Lady Lin’s birthday banquet, Feng Xianxian was so excited that she did not sleep the whole night. ”

She was looking forward to that scene too much.

Ye Zao was also a brainless person.

“After finding such an old man, he actually dared to bring him to the Lin family openly. ”

It was unknown who had spread the news that ye Zao was bringing his boyfriend back.

“For a moment, the people in the banquet hall were guessing who ye Zao’s boyfriend was. ”

“I have a piece of gossip here. It is said that the Lin family’s eldest daughter’s boyfriend is an old man about the same age as Old Lady Lin.”

“Is it true?”

“Of course it’s true! I heard that the old man is the leader of the scientific and technological world...”

The leader of the science and Technology World.

“So, Dr. YC’s identity was also fake? ”

“Although he only said half of his words, everyone had already understood. ”

“”If that’s really the case, then her eating manners are too ugly! For the sake of fame and fortune, she doesn’t even care about her reputation!” ”

“”She’s also amazing. For the sake of Fame and fortune, she’s even willing to eat such an old man!” ”

“...”

“Time passed by slowly, and soon, the birthday banquet began. Everyone sat down during the banquet. ”

“Feng Xianxian looked around, but she did not see ye Zao bringing his boyfriend over. She frowned slightly. ”

Could it be that ye Zao realized something and did not dare to bring that old man back?

“At this moment, a tall figure walked in from outside the door. Against the light, it was difficult to see his face clearly, but his powerful aura was not to be ignored. ”

That Was?

CEN fifth master?

Feng Xianxian’s eyes lit up.

That’s right!

That was CEN fifth master!

Why did CEN fifth master come?

Was he here for her?

“Thinking of this, Feng Xianxian could not help but feel her heartbeat quicken. ”

“Everyone turned their heads, as if they did not expect the dignified CEN fifth master to attend the Lin family’s banquet again and again. ”

“That figure was getting closer and closer to the banquet hall. At this moment, Feng Xianxian saw another figure beside him. ”

That Was?

Ye Zhuo?

What was going on?

Why did ye Zhuo appear beside Fifth Master Cen?

“Could it be that it was on the way, so they came in together? ”

“Before Feng Xianxian could react, ye Zhuo brought Cen Shaoqing to the banquet hall. “Father, mother, grandmother, and uncles and Aunties, let me introduce everyone. This is my boyfriend Cen Shaoqing.” ”
