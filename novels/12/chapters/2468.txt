Unable to extricate yourself.

“But now, Old Master Chen had actually asked her to give up on song Shiyu. She couldn’t accept it. ”

It wouldn’t work.

“Old Master Chen shook his head helplessly. “Yaoyao, it’s not the third time. Do you know how many times I’ve come for You?” ”

Everyone had their dignity.

Song Shiyu was clearly trampling on the Chen family’s dignity.

“If he went looking for song Shiyu again, it would be no different than asking for humiliation. ”

“”Grandpa, but I really love him. If I lose him or can’t be with him, my life will be meaningless.” ”

“If she was a fish, then song Shiyu was water. ”

Water could live without fish.

“But if a fish left water, it couldn’t survive at all! ”

“Yaoyao!”Old Master Chen said angrily when he saw Chen Siyao like this.

“Old Master Chen turned to look at Chen Siyao, then he said, “A face can live, but a tree can live with its skin! Especially for girls, Song Shiyu is just a human being no matter how outstanding he is! Why Can’t you live without him? Can’t you do something for the Chen Family?”! ”

She was still a girl after all.

“If he had known, he would have let Chen Youlong and his wife have a second child. ”

“If Chen Siyao had a younger brother or an older brother, he wouldn’t have had such a headache. ”

But Chen Siyao was the only child of the Chen family.

“”Grandfather, I can give up everything for him!”Chen Siyao continued, “Grandfather, you don’t understand at all!” ”

Old Master Chen only felt his chest twitch in pain. “Chen Siyao!”

“Chen Siyao looked at Old Master Chen like this, tears almost coming out of her eyes. “Please help me...” ”

“Old Master Chen continued, “Do you know Miss Ye?” ”

Miss Ye?

Chen Siyao was stunned.

“Old Master Chen sighed and continued, “I don’t Wish For You to be as outstanding as Miss Ye, but you have to grow up eventually. You Can’t die for a man!” ”

“Although Old Master Chen was already in his 80s, he paid a lot of attention to international news. ”

“Naturally, he also knew about the number one person on the aircraft carrier, Ye Zhuo. ”

How Old Was Ye Zhuo?

He was even a few years younger than Chen Siyao.

“If ye Zhuo was like Chen Siyao and had a love brain, would she have achieved what she did today? ”

“Calm down first.”Old Master Chen turned to look at the housekeeper. “Let’s go.”

“”Okay.”The housekeeper nodded, pushed Old Master Chen’s wheelchair, and walked out. ”

Out the door.

“Old Master Chen sighed and said regretfully, “Housekeeper, did I say too much to Yaoyao just now?” ”

“Before this, Old Master Chen had never compared Chen Siyao to anyone. ”

“This time, he was really angry! ”

“The butler said, “From a bystander’s point of view, I don’t think what you said is serious at all. The eldest miss needs someone to see the light of day. Once she has thought it through, everything will be fine.” ”

“”Is that so?”Hearing the Butler’s words, old master Chen heaved a sigh of relief. ”

“The butler nodded. “If I Were you, I would be the same as you.” ”

“Old Master Chen continued, “Actually, there’s nothing wrong with that child’s taste, but Song Shiyu is looking down on others!” ”

“There were some things that the butler could not say directly, so he could only say, “Don’t worry, young Miss will definitely find a better person in the future.” ”

“Some things were clear to the onlooker, but those who were involved were confused. Actually, in the Butler’s opinion, Old Master Chen’s act of extorting favors in return was indeed very repulsive. ”

“Although many years ago, he had indeed helped song Shiyu. ”

“But over the years, song Shiyu had helped the Chen family countless times. ”

He had even helped Chen Youlong many times.

“But Old Master Chen only remembered that he had saved song Shiyu, but he did not remember that song Shiyu had also saved the Chen family. ”

But it was not easy for them to say such words.

“After all, they were employees. ”

“Old Master Chen sighed again and continued, “Yaoyao is too stubborn! I’m just afraid that she won’t be able to get over this hurdle!” ”

“”She won’t,”the housekeeper continued to comfort her. “Eldest miss has a cheerful personality. I believe that she will be able to get over it very soon.” ”

Old Master Chen shook his head. “I hope so.”

“However, based on his understanding of Chen Siyao, Chen Siyao probably wouldn’t be able to get over it so soon. ”

“After all, Chen Siyao was different from the others. ”

“If it was anyone else who knew that song Shiyu rejected her, they would have given up. However, Chen Siyao didn’t. Not only did Chen Siyao not give up, but she kept begging for mercy. ”

Old Master Chen was also disappointed that he didn’t live up to his expectations!

“After Old Master Chen left, Chen Siyao sat on the ground with tears streaming down her face. ”Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m
