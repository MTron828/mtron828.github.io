“It’s alright.”Song Shiyu didn’t take this matter to heart.

“Two minutes later, the car stopped. ”

The assistant went around to the back and opened the door for the two of them.

“This restaurant was recommended by many internet celebrities. Although the address was in C Nation, Chinese people accounted for half of the total number of people who ate there. ”

“Just as the two of them walked in, a waiter welcomed them warmly. “Are you two?” ”

Song Shiyu nodded.

“Follow me.”

The two of them were led to a seat by the window.

The waiter brought over a tablet and handed it to Song Shiyu.

Song Shiyu smiled and looked at Ye Zhuo. “Ladies first. You Can Order.”

“Ye Zhuo said, “We agreed that I would treat you to a meal today. It should be the guests who order first.” ”

“Alright.”Song Shiyu took the menu and ordered two dishes. “You can order the rest.”

Ye Zhuo ordered a few of his favorite dishes.

“An hour later, the two of them finished eating and walked out of the restaurant. ”

“Song Shiyu said, “Ye Zhuo, where are you staying? I’ll get my assistant to send you back first.” ”

Ye Zhuo reported the name of the hotel.

Song Shiyu chuckled. “What a coincidence.”

“Ye Zhuo said in surprise, “You’re staying there too?” ”

“”Yeah.”Song Shiyu continued, “Intercontinental is a property under the song corporation.” ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “I see.” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Let’s go.”Song Shiyu reached out and opened the car door.

Ye Zhuo got into the car.

...

“The next day, Ye Zhuo packed his suitcase and prepared to leave C nation. ”

“Just then, the doorbell rang. ”

Ye Zhuo walked over to open the door.

It was Bai Xiaosu.

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Xiaosu, did you come to find me for something?” ”

“Bai Xiaosu nodded. “Miss Ye, there’s something I need to tell you.” ”

Ye Zao brought Bai Xiaosu into the house and poured her a glass of water. “Tell me slowly what it is.”

Bai Xiaosu drank a mouthful of water and then told her the whole story.

“It turned out that C nation had held an international shooting competition on the Nameless Island at the side. Many countries had come to participate in the competition. Bai Xiaosu was one of the contestants. She wanted to invite ye Zao to watch her competition, she wanted to give her some pointers on shooting as well. ”

Ye Zhuo nodded. “Sure.”

“Hearing this, Bai Xiaosu said excitedly, “Really, Miss Ye? You really agreed?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Bai Xiaosu continued, “Then you can come with me now! There’s training tonight. The competition will start the afternoon the day after tomorrow.” ”

“With Ye Zhuo’s guidance, Bai Xiaosu felt much more assured. ”

The two of them arrived at the Nameless Island at around six o’clock in the evening.

They took a cruise.

“It was dusk, and the golden sunlight covered the entire sea level. It was a magnificent sight. ”

More than fifty countries were participating in this shooting competition.

All fifty contestants were gathered in one training camp.

Bai Xiaosu introduced the competition process to Ye Zhuo.

“Bai Xiaosu had experienced professional training, so he was not afraid of anything else. What he was most worried about was blind shooting. ”

“As the name suggested, blind shooting required one to turn around and shoot with their back facing the bull’s eye. ”

“Ye Zao picked up his gun. “Actually, as long as you find the right position, blind shooting is no different from normal shooting. First, you must not feel any pressure. You must learn to relax.” ”

“There were other people in the training ground, and some of them understood Chinese. When an Asian player heard ye Zao’s words, he looked at ye Zao with curiosity. ”

“This little girl made it sound so simple, as if she knew how to shoot blindly. ”

No wonder people said that Chinese people liked to brag.

“”Miss, you made it sound so simple. Why Don’t you shoot US and let us have a look?”The moment she opened her mouth, she spoke the standard words. She was from the same Asian country, her facial features were almost no different from Chinese people. ”

“Ye Zao smiled faintly, pulled the trigger, and turned around. ”

Bang Bang Bang —

“After three gunshots, all three bullets hit the bull’s-eye. ”

“A moment later, ye Zao turned around. “How was it?” ”

The Korean contestant was stunned. She had never seen such a scene before.

“She was the best contestant who had practiced in many countries and could only reach three rings, but this person had actually hit the bull’s-eye with three shots. ”

The Korean player was now rejoicing that Ye Zhuo was not a regular player.

“Otherwise, they would all lose! ”

This scene was directly seen by a middle-aged woman in gorgeous clothes.

“Go check on her.”

“Okay.”The assistant next to her bent down.

“Soon, the assistant returned and whispered a few words into the middle-aged woman’s ear. ”

“Hearing this, the middle-aged woman asked, “Chinese?” ”

“Yes.”The assistant nodded.

“No.”The middle-aged woman’s eyes flashed with shrewdness. “She won’t be Chinese very soon.”

The assistant was stunned.

“The middle-aged woman continued, “Go and arrange it. Tell her that the Princess of Korea wants to see her.” ”

“That’s right. This middle-aged woman was the only Princess of Korea’s empress, Jin Yuyan. ”

“Yes.”The assistant immediately instructed someone to do it.

“Ten minutes later, the assistant returned to Jin Yuyan’s side and said with a somewhat troubled expression, “Princess, Miss Ye said she’s not free.” ”

Not Free?

Wasn’t not being free equivalent to not seeing her? Damn

Jin Yuyan frowned.

“She was the royal family of Korea, the Grand Princess who stood high and mighty. If nothing unexpected happened, she would inherit the throne from her mother and become the next empress. ”

“If it were anyone else, they would probably be extremely happy. ”

But this Chinese girl directly rejected her.

This made Jin Yuyan a little surprised.

This Chinese girl was a little different from what she had imagined.

“Jin Yuyan continued, “Go back and say that I like her very much. As long as she is willing, I will give her the nationality of the entire Korean family, and I will also give them the status of a high-class noble. The prerequisite is that she must win this competition for me in the name of the Korean players and get first place.” ”

“As the eldest princess, Jin Yuyan had seen all kinds of people. ”

She believed that no one in this world could resist the temptation of money and fame.

There were many Chinese immigrants in the Korean country.

Some young girls would even marry local elders in order to become a Korean.

“Therefore, Jin Yuyan believed that ye Zao would definitely agree. ”

Jin Yuyan was a little excited when she thought about how Korea would soon stand out among the fifty countries and win this competition. She wanted to tell her mother the good news immediately.

“After all, a person like ye Zao was not only a shooter, but also a rare talent for them. ”

“Jin Yuyan had a good eye for people. Although they were far apart, when ye Zao designed it, Jin Yuyan could clearly see the viciousness in ye Zao’s body. ”

This viciousness was not found in many men.

“In a moment, the assistant came back. ”

“Jin Yuyan said impatiently, “How is it? Did she agree?” ”

The assistant shook his head.

“Rejected?”Jin Yuyan said in disbelief.

“In this world, how could anyone reject this kind of exorbitant wealth? ”

“Jin Yuyan narrowed her eyes and continued, “Chinese people are cautious by nature. She will definitely think that you are a liar. Take this with you.” ”
