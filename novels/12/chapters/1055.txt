“Okay! Okay!”

“After hanging up the phone, Zhao Pingting’s mother didn’t dare to tell Zhao Pingting’s father about this, so she called Zhao Yingjun. ”

“Zhao Yingjun immediately put down his work after receiving the call. “Mom, don’t tell my dad about this first! I’ll be back right away! Don’t worry, don’t Worry!”Zhao Yingjun’s father’s heart hadn’t been too good recently, but he couldn’t take such a shock. ”

“Half an hour later, Zhao Yingjun returned home. ”

“Mother Zhao had already packed her luggage. “Yingjun, you stay at home. I’m going to Beijing!” ”

“”I’m going too!”Zhao Pingting’s whereabouts were unknown. As his older brother, Zhao Yingjun really couldn’t just passively wait at home. ”

Mother Zhao was a little worried. “We’ve both left. How are you going to explain it to your dad?”

Zhao Yingjun narrowed his eyes. “We can’t care too much now! I’ll tell Tang Jia to deal with our Dad! Let’s go quickly! I’ll book the plane tickets!”

“Fortunately, it was the off-season for tourism, so they were able to book the plane tickets very quickly. ”

In Beijing.

“Just as they were panicking, Ye Zhuo traced the location of his phone. ”

“After confirming the specific address, ye Zhuo stood up from his chair. “Lizi, let’s go.” ”

“Where are we going?”An Lizi was stunned.

“Ye Zao said, “We Found Ping Ting’s phone’s location.” ”

“Really?”An Lizi said happily.

Ye Zao nodded slightly and picked up the car keys.

An Lizi immediately followed ye Zao’s footsteps.

“Soon, a Black Land Rover sped past the manor area. ”

The speed of the car was very fast.

An Lizi tilted her head and looked at ye Zao.

It was the first time she felt that ye Zhuo was so unfamiliar.

He was cool and handsome.

“Before long, the car stopped steadily at a recycling station. ”

Ye Zhuo opened the car door and got out.

An Lizi followed closely behind.

“This recycling station was not big. When she entered the door, she saw three children standing there playing. ”

An Lizi’s sharp eyes noticed that one of the children was holding Zhao Pingting’s hand. “That’s Pingting’s phone!”

“An Lizi had personally picked out Zhao Pingting’s phone case, so she recognized it at a glance. ”

“Ye Zhuo walked over and bent down slightly. “Little friend, where did you get this phone?” ”

“”I picked it up beside the trash can.”The child holding the phone handed it to Ye Zhuo. “Sister, is this your phone?” ”

Ye Zhuo took the phone. “This is my friend’s phone. Can you take me to the place where you picked it up?”

“The child nodded. “Sister, follow me.” ”

Ye Zhuo and an Lizi followed the three children.

“After a while, they came to the side of the trash can. ”

“This trash can was very far from the road. There were no surveillance cameras around it. Besides a waste recycling station, there were no other buildings nearby. ”

Ye Zhuo frowned slightly.

“If there were surveillance cameras, she could still use them to find out who threw the phone. ”

“But now, there was nothing. It was too difficult to find out. ”

“Ye Zhuo lowered his head to look at the child and continued, “Child, when did you pick up this phone?” ”

“I don’t remember what time it was either.”The child scratched his head. “It was about one or two hours after breakfast.”

“Ye Zhuo smiled. “Thank you, child. I know. Oh right, this is for you.”Ye Zhuo took out three bear pendants and gave them to the child. ”

“The child was very happy. “Thank you, Sister.” ”

“”You’re welcome.”Ye Zhuo continued, “You guys should hurry back so that your parents won’t worry.” ”

“”Goodbye, Sister.” ”

“An Lizi searched around the rubbish bin but did not find anything useful. She turned to look at Ye Zhuo. “Zhuo Zhuo, do you think that the three children were lying?” ” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Ye Zao shook his head. “The children did not speak. They did find the phone.”Ye Zao knew a little about psychology. When the three children were talking to her.., their eyes did not hide or look unnatural. If they were lying, they would not be so calm. ”

An Lizi frowned.

“Ye Zao continued, “This person is very smart. After chatting with me, he realized that something was wrong, so he damaged the phone in advance and threw it next to an unmonitored rubbish bin.”Ye Zao turned to look at an Lizi, “Let’s go home first.” ”

The only way now was to repair Zhao Pingting’s phone and see if he could find any clues in her phone!
