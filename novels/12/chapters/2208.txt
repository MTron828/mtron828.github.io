“I will object.”Ye Zhuo nodded. “You are not suitable for him!”

“Shi Qingcheng was stunned, and the smile on her face froze. ”

“Although she was mentally prepared, Shi Qingcheng still could not accept it. But on the other hand, it was normal for ye Zhuo to object. After all, she was a few years older than ye Han. ”

“Ye Han listened to ye Zao the most. Even if ye Zao objected, then even if ye Han liked her, he would not be together with her. ”

“Seeing Shi Qingcheng like this, Ye Zao chuckled. “I’m just teasing you! You guys, Ye Han, and your lovers will eventually become tendrils. I’m more than happy. Why should I object?” ”

“Shi Qingcheng was ecstatic. “Zao, you really don’t object?” ”

“”I don’t object,”ye Zao said. ”

“Then you don’t mind that I’m older than Ye Xiaohan?”Shi Qingcheng asked.

“”Ye Han himself doesn’t mind, so why should I mind?”Ye Zao continued, “Do I look like such a busybody sister?” ”

“”No, no, of course not!”Shi Qingcheng Hugged ye Zao and said happily, “Zao Zao, thank you!” ”

“”Idiot! I should be the one thanking you.”Ye Zao patted Shi Qingcheng’s hand. “Ye Han is not good at expressing his feelings. If you don’t take a step forward, he will never take the initiative to take a step forward.” ”

...

“Coming into the house, ye Han closed the doors and windows. ”

Cen Shaoqing looked at his actions and twirled the Buddhist beads in his hand. He had some unclear intentions of Manchu.

“After a while, ye Han closed all the doors and windows and walked over. “Mr. Cen, please take a seat first. I have a question to ask you.” ”

Cen Shaoqing leaned over and sat opposite ye Han. “What question? You ASK.”

“Ye Han continued, “At that time, between you and my sister, who was the one who pursued who?” ”

“”I pursued her,”Cen Shaoqing said frankly. ”

“Ye Han said, “I heard that before you met my sister, you had the idea of becoming a monk, right?” ”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“”Then how did you find out that you like my sister? In other words, what does it feel like to like someone?”Ye Han was really too curious about his feelings towards Shi Qingcheng. ”

Did he like her?

“Shi Qingcheng had given him a deadline, so he had to make a choice before tomorrow. ”

“Cen Shaoqing’s image of ye Zao appeared in front of his eyes as he slowly opened his mouth to speak, “I don’t know what it’s like to like her. It’s because when I see her, my heart will beat faster, and when I miss her, my heart will also beat faster. When I’m with her, I can’t help but smile. Nothing in the world can compare to her smile... “... ...” ”

“At that time, Cen Shaoqing had fallen into a misunderstanding. He felt that his heart was racing because he had contracted some kind of disease. ”

“Of course, such a thing was not easy to say out loud. ”

What If ye Han laughed at him?

“”Does a racing heart mean that you like him?”Ye Han did not know what he had thought of, but he fell into a short period of contemplation. ”

“”To me, that’s the case.”Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted slightly, and he continued, “Are you curious about your feelings for Shi Qingcheng?” ”

“”Mr. Cen, how do you know?”Ye Han asked curiously. ”

Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips curled up slightly. “Your worries are written all over your face.”

“Ye Han continued, “Then how do you think I feel about Qingcheng? Do I like her? She asked me to give her an answer tomorrow.” ”

“”This kind of thing can only be asked of yourself. If you like her, then promise her. If you don’t like her, don’t delay her.” ”

“Hearing this, Ye Han seemed to have thought of something. He moved closer to Cen Shaoqing’s ear and whispered a few words. After a moment, he continued, “Mr. Cen, will such a situation also happen to you?” ”

“Originally, such a private matter was not something that could be directly said, but now, he could not care about it anymore. ”

“Cen Shaoqing was a little embarrassed. He coughed lightly and said, “You must never say such things in front of your sister.” ”

“”I know, I know. Although she is my sister, there are differences between men and women after all!”Ye Han could not wait to say, “So, Mr. Cen, have you ever done it?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing did not answer him directly. Instead, he said, “Your situation is very normal. If that person is Shi Qingcheng, then I am very sure that you have her in your heart.” ”

“Really?”Ye Han asked.

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Ye Han smiled and said, “Mr. Cen, so you have had one too?” ”

“No.”Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddha bead.

“It meant that this person in front of him was his future brother-in-law. Otherwise, he would have already gotten someone to throw him out. ”

His future brother-in-law could only endure it.

Ye Han glanced at Cen Shaoqing. “You really didn’t?”

“”I really didn’t.”CEN Shaoqing continued, “If there’s nothing else, I’ll leave first. Your sister is still waiting for me outside.” ”

“”En, you can go.”Ye Han nodded. ”

“Looking at Cen Shaoqing’s back view, Ye Han’s lips curled into a smile. He thought that he should have the answer in his heart. ”

“At the same time, a piece of news broke out on the starnet. ”

“Previously, everyone suspected that the death of the man Jiangshan couple was not an accident, but it was true! ”

“Because the real murderer who hired the murderer was man Wen, the person who poisoned him had already confessed to man Wen. ” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Man Wen had just gone through the general election, and now such a thing had happened. For a moment, everyone was discussing animatedly, and man Wen was also facing charges. ”
