“Hearing that, he ziteng immediately said, “Uncle, I’m not in a hurry at all. There’s no need to rush him. I’ll wait.” ”

“Father Xu smiled and said, “How can that be! Don’t delay the movie. Yaoyao’s mother, hurry up and rush him. This child has no sense of time at all.” ”

“”Okay, I’ll go right away.”Mother Xu nodded and walked upstairs. ”

“Father Xu looked at He ziteng and smiled. “Yaoyao should be coming down soon. Come, let the two of us sit down and have some tea.” ”

“No matter how father Xu looked at he ziteng now, he felt comfortable. ”

“In his heart, he was also lamenting that Xu Yao was a capable person. She actually managed to subdue he ziteng! ”

He Ziteng was a walking noble!

“Most importantly, he ziteng was the only son of the He family. ” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“As long as Xu Yao married into the He family, she would be the mistress of the He family. ”

“At that time, she would be able to call the wind and summon the rain. She could have anything she wanted! ”

“When he thought of that scene, father Xu’s eyes were filled with pride. ”

Although he did nothing in his life and relied on his sister to live.

But his daughter had a promising future.

Xu Yao merely hooked her little finger and he ziteng was able to ride on her back.

Mother Xu walked upstairs.

“Xu Yao sat in front of the mirror, dabbing and dabbing. She was extremely relaxed, as if she did not know that he ziteng had already arrived. ”

“Yaoyao.”

“Mm.”Xu Yao turned to look at Mother Xu.

“Mother Xu continued, “Yaoyao, hurry up. Little he has already arrived. Don’t let him wait for too long.” ”

“Xu Yao picked up two lipsticks and tested the color on the back of her hands. She then said, “What’s wrong with waiting? Go Down and ask him. Does he dare to have any complaints?” ”

“After spending some time with him, Xu Yao realized that he ziteng was a despicable person. ”

He didn’t like women who were obedient to him. He had to like women who were a little too pretentious.

“However, he couldn’t be too pretentious. ”

“When he was acting, he had to be considerate. ”

He had to know his limits.

“Mother Xu smiled and said, “My daughter is really capable! But you can’t keep her waiting for too long. I heard from little he that he seems to want to bring you back to meet his parents.” ”

This matter was within Xu Yao’s expectations. “I know.”

“Did he tell you?”Mother Xu asked.

“Xu Yao continued, “I guessed.” ”

“Mother Xu said, “Have you thought about what to bring when you go to meet her parents? Do you want your father and I to go with you?” ”

“That’s nothing. I don’t need you and father to accompany me for the time being. I’ll go with He ziteng.”

“”That’s fine too.”Mother Xu nodded, then, she said, “I heard that he ziteng’s mother was born into a prestigious family. She’s a real daughter of a rich family. She has a strange personality and is very difficult to get along with. You have to be careful. Although mother-in-law and daughter-in-law have been natural enemies since ancient times, you can’t make her unhappy on the first day!” ”

“Xu Yao curled the corners of her lips. “Don’t worry, Mom. You Don’t have to worry about such things. I know what to do.” ”

“She could even subdue a rich young master like he ziteng, let alone he ziteng’s mother. ”

So what if mother he was born into a prestigious family?

“In the end, she was just a housewife now. ”

What was so great about being a housewife?

“With just a little trick, she could make the he family’s parents want her as their daughter-in-law! ”

“Xu Yao did not have other abilities, but she still had this bit of confidence. ”

“Otherwise, he ziteng would not be so loyal to her. ”

“Although Xu Yao said so, mother Xu was still a little worried, she continued, “Yaoyao, you can’t let your guard down on this kind of thing. He ziteng’s mother is different from me. Moreover, this first impression is very important. It directly affects whether you can directly enter the he family’s Gate!” ”

“Xu Yao was a little speechless as she said, “Mom, don’t worry too much!” ”
