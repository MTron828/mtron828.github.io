The little girl in front of him might really be a relative of the Bai family.

“Wait a moment.”The security guard returned to the security booth and called the Lin family to verify.

“The person who answered the call was the butler of the Lin family. Upon hearing that the other party’s surname was Bai and that she was Bai Jingshu’s cousin, the butler immediately called Ye Shu over. ”

“Upon hearing this, Ye Shu smiled and said, “Jingshu indeed has a younger sister named Bai Mo. . That Old Wang, quickly send someone in!” ”

“Okay.”The butler nodded.

“Bai Jingshu was also at the Lin residence. When she heard that something was wrong, she immediately walked out. “What’s Wrong?” ”

“Ye Shu raised her head and looked at Bai Jingshu. “Jingshu, your cousin is here. She’s right outside the door! Let’s go out together to welcome her.” ”

“After all, she was Bai Jingshu’s cousin. They couldn’t neglect her. ”

“Hearing this, Bai Jingshu furrowed her brows. “Cousin? Could it be Bai Mo?” ”

“The Butler immediately nodded. “Yes, the security said that the lady outside is called Bai Mo. .” ”

“It really was Bai Mo. hearing this, Bai Jingshu’s expression turned ugly. ”

“As Bai Mo’s cousin, Bai Jingshu understood Bai Mo better. Bai Mo was a little aloof and proud. She looked down on Earth. Why would she take the initiative to come to Earth? ”

Unless...

For Lin Ze.

“Thinking of this, Bai Jingshu’s eyes were filled with slight anger. ”

“”Auntie, wait.”Because there wasn’t a wedding on Earth yet, Bai Jingshu still addressed ye Shu as Auntie. ”

“HMM?”Ye Shu raised her head to look at Bai Jingshu.

“Bai Jingshu didn’t hide anything and said directly, “My relationship with my cousin isn’t very good. It’s best not to let her in.” ”

“Bai Mo was a person with many tricks up his sleeve. If she was allowed to enter, then the Lin family’s future life would definitely change because of her. ”

“After all, from the look in Bai Mo’s eyes, he was a troublemaker. ”

“Ye Shu naturally knew about Bai Jingshu’s situation and continued, “Alright then. Butler, tell the security outside that Jingshu doesn’t have a cousin.” ”

“The Butler was also a shrewd person. He immediately understood what ye Shu meant and nodded. “Yes, Madam, I understand.” ”

“After the Butler returned the call, Ye Shu looked at Bai Jingshu and continued, “Jingshu, we should be fine doing this, right?” ”

“Bai Mo was, after all, Bai Jingshu’s cousin. If news of this spread to the s galaxy, Ye Shu was a little worried that it would affect Bai Jingshu’s reputation. ”

“”It’s fine, Auntie.”Bai Jingshu continued, “This cousin of mine has always had a lot of ideas since she was young. She’s also very thoughtful. This time, she must have secretly come to Earth as well.” ”

“Bai Jingshu’s words were a little tactful, but ye Shu could roughly guess what was going on. “Oh right, Jingshu, is this Bai Mo the one who went on a blind date with Ah Ze?” ”

“”Yes.”Bai Jingshu nodded. “So, you probably already know why she came to Earth at this time, right? The planet she looked down on the most in the past was Earth.” ”

“If it was in the past, Bai Jingshu would have let Bai Mo in. After all, she and Bai Mo had an unceasing blood relationship. But now, after experiencing so many things, she would not. ”

Because being merciful to others was cruel to herself.

“If she really let Bai Mo in, there would definitely be trouble. ”

Bai Mo’s visit was not friendly to begin with.

“Hearing that, Ye Shu frowned slightly. “I didn’t expect this little girl to have such deep thoughts! Luckily, I didn’t let her in.” ”

Outside.

“Bai Mo stood outside the security room and waited for a long time. Finally, the security room door was opened again. ”

Bai Mo immediately stood up and walked over. “May I enter now?”

The security guard shook his head. “I called and asked. The Lin family said that they don’t have any relatives like you.”

No relatives like her?

What kind of relatives was she?

“Bai Mo said impatiently, “Did you tell them who I am?” ”

“I did.”The security guard nodded.

“Bai Mo continued, “Then what did you say? Did you say that I’m Bai Jingshu’s cousin, Bai Mo?” ”

“”I’ve said it as well.”The security guard continued, “Madam, this is a private residential area. Please leave immediately!” ”

Bai Mo’s face was filled with disbelief. She had not expected that she would not even be able to enter the Lin family’s main entrance.

How could this be? UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Bai Jingshu!

It must be Bai Jingshu!

“Bai Mo’s expression was especially ugly. Her hands were tightly clasped together. Because she had used too much force, her knuckles had already turned slightly white. ”

That damned Bai Jingshu had repeatedly ruined her plans!

“When the security guard saw that Bai Jingshu had not moved for a long time, he continued, “Madam, can you please leave immediately? Otherwise, I’ll call the Police!” ”
