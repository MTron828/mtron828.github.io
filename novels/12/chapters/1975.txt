“After saying that, Xu Yao turned to look at the he family’s parents. “Uncle and Auntie, you have to believe me. I really haven’t done anything to betray ziteng!” ”

“He ziteng was, after all, the He family’s parents’biological son. The bloodline issue was not a small issue. At this moment, they would definitely stand on he ziteng’s side. ”

The appraisal had to be done.

“Father he deliberated over the words in his heart and continued, “Why don’t you do an appraisal? This way, you can clear your name. Yaoyao, this is actually a good thing for you!” ”

Mother he nodded in agreement. “Your uncle is right. A righteous person is not afraid of a slanted shadow. It’s not a big deal to do an appraisal.”

“Xu Yao smiled bitterly. “Alright, I got it.” ”

“After saying that, Xu Yao looked at he ziteng. “I didn’t expect that I would be so unbearable in your heart!” ”

“”Xu Yao, is there any point in doing this?”He ziteng continued, “You’ll only make me feel even more disgusted with you!” ”

Xu Yao’s face was covered in tears.

The few of them came to the appraisal department together.

They took samples for testing.

“Just as they were taking samples, Mi Chen looked at he ziteng. “Ziteng, have you really thought it through? Once you do the amniocentesis, there’s No Room for regret!” ”

“Why would I regret it? Are you feeling guilty?”He ziteng looked at Mi Chen.

“Mi Chen sighed. “Since you’ve already made up your mind, I won’t say anything else. I don’t want you to be suspicious.” ”

“As she finished speaking, Mi Chen walked out and happened to see the he family’s parents. ”

“Uncle and Auntie.”Mi Chen walked over.

The He family’s parents looked at Mi Chen with a complicated expression.

They had known Mi Chen for more than three years.

“In their eyes, Mi Chen had always been a kind, ambitious, and good child. ”

But now...

Something like this had happened.

“He ziteng was their biological son. As parents, they knew his character very well. ”

“If Mi Chen and Xu Yao were really innocent, he ziteng wouldn’t have made any groundless accusations and wouldn’t have wronged them. ”

Unless...

“Under the current circumstances, they could only do an appraisal. Only then would their parents feel at ease. ”

“Mi Chen narrowed her eyes and walked in front of the He family’s parents without batting an eyelid, she continued, “I’ve already taken a sample, but I still hope that the two of you can stop ziteng. I really don’t have any improper relationship with Xu Yao. Xu Yao’s current month is small, and her fetus is already unstable. If we forcefully do an amniocentesis, it will definitely affect the fetus.” ”

“At this point, mi Chen continued, “I know that uncle and Auntie will definitely think that I’m guilty, but I can vouch for you with my character. I’ve never done anything to let the two elders down or ziteng down!” ”

Mi Chen’s words also had a hidden meaning.

“If he really wanted to harm the he family’s parents, he wouldn’t have saved mother he back then. ”

“Saving people and harming them, wasn’t that unnecessary? ” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

And he would even implicate himself in jail!

“Father he looked at Mi Chen, then he said, “Doctor Mi, you saved your aunt. If it weren’t for you back then, your aunt wouldn’t be in her current state. But you know Zi Teng’s character well. If you don’t investigate thoroughly, he won’t stop. So, it’s been hard on You!” ”

“Father he was also a businessman, so he naturally knew what Mi Chen meant by her words. ”

“Mi Chen nodded, she continued, “I don’t mind. The one who has been wronged is Xu Yao. “Uncle, aunt, when Ziteng was in the car accident, he hit his head. What he heard was just a figment of his imagination. He can’t humiliate Xu Yao just because of a figment of his imagination. Xu Yao is a girl!” ”

“Mother he spoke at the right time, “Doctor Mi, I know what you mean. Don’t worry. If there’s no problem with the results of the test, the two of US will definitely make it up to Xu Yao.” ”

Mother he’s address of Xu Yao had changed from Yaoyao to Xu Yao. This was enough to prove her attitude.

“Mi Chen narrowed her eyes without a trace. “Since uncle and Auntie have made up their minds, there’s no use for me to say anything. As long as uncle and Auntie Don’t blame me for not warning the two of you!” ”

“Right at this moment, Xu Yao finished her amniocentesis. ”

Her face was deathly pale.

“Sitting on the blue plastic chair in the waiting area, it made one’s heart ache. ”

“Mother he immediately walked over. “Xu Yao, Are You Alright?” ”

“Xu Yao immediately sensed that something was wrong with mother he. She smiled and shook her head. “I’m fine, Auntie.” ”

That Old Ouyang Xunfang.

Just you wait.
