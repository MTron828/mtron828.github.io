Translator: 549690339

“At this point, Cen Shaoqing paused and continued, “Checking up on me?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Let me see if you have a mistress.”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Who?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly.

Cen Shaoqing chuckled and reached out to hold her waist. “You.”

“Is this how you use a golden house to hide a mistress?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“If she remembered correctly, a golden house to hide a mistress was used to describe a third party. ”

“Ye Zhuo glanced at Cen Shaoqing and said in a shallow voice, “It’s scary to be uneducated!” ”

“”Why not?”Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted slightly, “The story of a golden house to hide a mistress originated from the story of Hanwu. Princess Guan Tao asked Hanwu emperor Liu Che if he was willing to marry his eldest daughter, Ah Jiao. When Hanwu emperor Liu Che heard this, he said happily, “If I can marry Ah Jiao as my wife, I will build a golden house for her to live in.”. Princess Guan Tao was very happy when she heard this. She immediately agreed to the marriage, and Hanwu emperor Liu Che also built a golden house. Chen Ah Jiao also became the mother of a country.” ”

“Therefore, the term “Hidden concubine in the Golden House”was not used to describe a third party. However, people in the later generations said the same thing, and people in the later generations misunderstood. ”

“Hearing this, Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly and said with a smile, “Cultured people are indeed different. What about the Golden House you built for me?” ”

“You Like It?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“Who doesn’t like gold?”Ye Zhuo asked back.

“Cen Shaoqing opened his thin lips slightly and said, “As long as madam likes it, I will immediately get someone to arrange it.” ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled without saying anything and continued, “Are you ready?” ”

“”Wait for me to take a shower,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“There was a bathroom in the gym. After Cen Shaoqing entered, the sound of water splashing could be heard from inside. ”

Ye Zhuo sat outside and played with his phone.

The sunlight shone in through the French window and coated her body with a faint layer of golden light.

The years were peaceful and the world was peaceful.

“About fifteen minutes later, Cen Shaoqing walked out of the bathroom. ”

“Cen Shaoqing, who had changed into a plain robe, looked like a handsome young man who had walked out of an oil painting from the Republic of China. He was completely different from Cen Shaoqing, who had just exercised. ”

One was refined.

The other was black-bellied. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Looking at Cen Shaoqing like this, Ye Zhuo suddenly remembered that she had never seen Cen Shaoqing in a formal suit. ”

“Ever since she met Cen Shaoqing, Cen Shaoqing had been dressed in plain clothes. ”

“If this person was wearing a suit, what would he look like? ”

“Thinking of this, Ye Zao’s eyes lit up. ”

Cen Shaoqing walked over and reached out to Pat ye Zao on the head. “What are you thinking about?”

“Huh?”Ye Zao reacted. “Are you done?”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing turned around and walked forward. “Let’s go in first.”

“Okay.”Ye Zao followed Cen Shaoqing’s footsteps.

The two of them went into the study.

Cen Shaoqing brought two plates of desserts. “Eat something first.”

Ye Zao had never had any resistance towards desserts.

“Soon, the two plates of desserts reached the bottom. ”

Cen Shaoqing took out the spirit pendulum and began to hypnotize.

“As the jade pendant swayed, ye Zao slowly fell asleep. ”

Cen Shaoqing picked up his phone and sent a message: [ is there a gold mine under my name? ]

Using a gold mine to build a gold house shouldn’t be a problem.

On the other side.

The Xu family.

“Mother Xu looked at Xu Yao and said, “Yaoyao, how are you and he ziteng doing recently?” ”

Mother Xu was very concerned about this matter.

“After all, this concerned the Xu family’s future. ”

“Once Xu Yao became the he family’s matriarch, the Xu family’s status in the capital would also rise. ”

“Mother Xu also had many nieces from her family. After Xu Yao married he ziteng, she could introduce her cousins to families of equal status with the He family. ”

“At that time, the Xu family would control the connections of the entire wealthy family. ”

“In this era, it was easy to get things done with people. ”

“If the cycle continued, then the entire capital would become the XU family’s world. ”

“Xu Yao said, “It’s still the same.” ”

Still the same?

“Hearing this, mother Xu frowned slightly. ”

“”Why is it still the same?”Mother Xu continued, “What Kind of girl can’t he ziteng Find? Some things are too much. Yaoyao, you have to make preparations earlier...” ”

The rest was self-evident.

Liking also had a shelf life.

What if he ziteng lost interest in Xu Yao because Xu Yao was hanging on to He ziteng?

“Hearing this, Xu Yao was also a little worried. ”

“After spending time with he ziteng, Xu Yao found many girls who were more beautiful and had a better family background than her. ”
