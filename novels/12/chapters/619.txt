Old Lady Lin’s heart skipped a beat when she heard this. “Disappointed in me? Why?”

Feng Xianxian was such a good child. Old Lady Lin did not want Feng Xianxian to have any misunderstandings about her.

“Aunt Zhang said, “Old Lady, have you forgotten what you promised Xianxian before? You promised her that you would definitely set her up with fifth master Cen, but now... do you really remember that matter?” ”

“With that said, Old Madam Lin remembered. ”

She had previously mentioned this matter in front of old Madam Cen.

“Aunt Zhang observed her expression, she said, “Old Madam, can’t you tell?”? Xianxian had always had fifth master Cen in her heart. When you said that you wanted to set her up with the Lin family, what was she so happy about? “And now, a perfectly fine marriage has been preempted by someone else. Do you think she would be happy?” ”

“Speaking up to this point, Aunt Zhang Sighed, “Xianxian, that child, also had a tough life. She didn’t have a father since she was young. Miss Qianhua has guarded Jin city for nineteen years. She originally thought that their love would blossom and bear fruit, but in the end, it was still preempted by someone else! Tell me, why do these two mother and daughter have such a tough life?” ”

“Hearing this, a layer of anger gradually appeared in Old Madam Lin’s eyes. ”

Ye Shu herself was not a good person. She liked to steal other people’s things and had a daughter who was just like her!

She was just as shameless as her!

“Aunt Zhang continued, “Old Madam, Xianxian has always treated you as her own grandmother since she was young. You must uphold justice for her in this matter.” ”

“Old Lady Lin sighed, “I did not consider this matter thoroughly. Indeed, I have let Xianxian down. Don’t worry, I will definitely make a decision for Xianxian! Let that wild girl return Shaoqing to Xianxian!” ”

“Really?”Aunt Zhang’s eyes lit up.

Old Lady Lin nodded.

“Aunt Zhang asked worriedly, “Then what if eldest miss doesn’t agree?” ”

“”Shaoqing is Xianxian to begin with! What right does she have to disagree?”Old Lady Lin continued, “Besides, Xianxian is her younger sister. As an elder sister, shouldn’t she give way to her younger sister?” ”

“In Old Lady Lin’s opinion, ye Zhuo should give way to Feng Xianxian. ”

“Moreover, Feng Xianxian was the one who knew Cen Shaoqing First! ”

“Old Lady Lin continued, “I’ll go find Bai Tang tomorrow to clarify this matter! Apart from Xianxian, no one else has the right to enter the Cen Family!” ”

“Aunt Zhang narrowed her eyes, and a smug look flashed across her eyes. ”

“After Old Lady Lin fell asleep, Aunt Zhang returned to the servant’s room and called Feng Qianhua. ”

“Feng Qianhua was probably waiting for Aunt Zhang’s call as well, so she quickly picked up the phone. “Hello.” ”

“”Qianhua,”aunt Zhang’s voice came from the receiver. “Tell Xianxian not to be sad. I’ve settled everything. Old Lady will personally make a trip to the Cen family tomorrow.” ” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Really?”Feng Qianhua was overjoyed.

“With the relationship between Old Madam Lin and old Madam Cen, as long as Old Madam Lin was willing to personally make an appearance, Old Madam Cen would not accept ye Zhuo. ”

“Really.”

“Feng Qianhua said, “Right, do you have enough money on hand now?” ”

“”Enough, enough. You Don’t have to worry about the money.” ”

“Feng Qianhua continued, “If you don’t have enough, you must tell me. The weather has been getting colder and colder recently. Please keep warm.” ”

“”Okay, you too. It’s getting late. Go to bed early. Don’t let your imagination run wild. Call me if there’s anything.” ”

Ye Zhuo pressed the wireless earpiece on his ear and listened to the conversation between the two of them.

She had been paying attention to Feng Qianhua and Aunt Zhang for a long time.

“In just two weeks, Feng Qianhua and Aunt Zhang had spoken on the phone more than 30 times. ”

“Moreover, every conversation was like a spy meeting. ”

Now it seemed that.

Aunt Zhang and Feng Qianhua had an unceasing relationship.

And their relationship should be very close.

“Because at the end of every call, Feng Qianhua would tell Aunt Zhang to take care of her body. Her words were extremely familiar. It did not seem like a partnership, but more like a family. ”

“Thinking of this, Ye Zhuo tapped the table with his fingers. ”

“”Little White, go and print a copy of Feng Qianhua’s information.” ”

“”Okay, leave this matter to the universe’s number one expert, little white!” ”

Little White’s title of the universe’s number one expert did not come for nothing.

“When ye Zao first assembled little white, he had spent a lot of effort. Little White had the world’s most advanced search engine, which knew astronomy and geography. ”

“After half an hour, Whitey glided to Ye Zao’s side with the printed information. ”
