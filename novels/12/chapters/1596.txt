“Chapter 1597: 340: returning to her previous life, so this karma was for her! 6”

Translator: 549690339

Mu Yourong’s eyes widened as she looked at the terrifying man in front of her. Her heart was in a state of panic.

“In the next second, the man bent down slightly and removed the tape on Mu Yourong’s mouth. ”

“Looking at the handsome face that was magnified several times before her eyes, Mu Yourong’s eyes were filled with fear. She leaned back on the back of the chair, her body constantly leaning back, “What do you want to Do? Song Shiyu, what do you want to Do? Why Won’t You Let Me Go!” ”

“Shh.”

“Song Shiyu put his index finger to his lips, making a gesture of silence. ”

“Mu Yourong immediately shut up, not daring to say another word. ”

She did not know what this terrifying man would do next.

“Fear, panic... ... that feeling, it was as if she would die at any moment under this devil’s palm. ”

“Because she had the experience of her previous life, ever since she was reborn, she had always been far away from this devil. ”

But it just so happened that song Shiyu’s ghost did not disperse.

The air was very quiet. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Song Shiyu just stared at Mu Yourong like this.

It was as if the grim reaper was staring at a person who was about to die.

“Mu Yourong was covered in cold sweat, and it was difficult for her to breathe. ”

The next second.

Song Shiyu was high-fived.

“The assistant immediately walked in from outside, carrying a syringe. ”

“Seeing the syringe, the fear in Mu Yourong’s eyes was magnified. “No! No! Please let me go!” ”

“Song Shiyu unhurriedly put on a pair of rubber gloves, and then took the syringe from the assistant. He squeezed out the air inside, and a faint smile appeared on his lips. ”

“When he smiled, he looked very beautiful. ”

Like a spring breeze.

“In her previous life, Mu Yourong had been deceived by this song Shiyu, which was why she had chosen to marry him. In the end, she ended up dying a miserable death. ”

“When she saw the same smile again in this life, Mu Yourong could only feel endless fear. ”

Why?

Why did song Shiyu want to pester her so much.

Why couldn’t song Shiyu let her go.

What did she do wrong?

“Seeing song Shiyu approaching her step by step, Mu Yourong screamed hysterically, close to despair. ”

“”I told you to shut up!”Song Shiyu’s expression suddenly became ferocious. Seeing song Shiyu like this, Mu Yourong panicked even more. Using both hands and feet, she was full of ugliness. She didn’t want this.., in her previous life, she had died under song Shiyu’s hands. She understood song Shiyu’s methods, but at that moment, she simply could not control herself. ”

Song Shiyu grabbed Mu Yourong’s hair. “This Daddy wants you to shut up!”

“With that, he directly stabbed the needle into Mu Yourong’s flesh. ”

“Mu Yourong’s pupils suddenly dilated, and then she fainted just like that. ”

“Seeing that Mu Yourong had fainted, Song Shiyu finally released her and slowly took off the rubber gloves in his hands. However, in the blink of an eye, he returned to his gentle and handsome appearance. ”

It was as if that devil-like man just now was not him at all.

“After a moment, song Shiyu turned to look at his assistant and slowly said, “Let’s starve for three days first. I’ll come back in three days.” ”

“Okay.”The assistant nodded.

Mu Yourong had a dream.

“In the dream, she had returned to her previous life. ”

“At this time, she had already been tortured by song Shiyu until she did not look like a human being. ”

She was emaciated.

“She did not understand why song Shiyu, who loved her so much, would treat her like this. ”

Could it be that song Shiyu had married her just to torture her?

There was no reason.

“If song Shiyu did not love her, he would not have funded and helped the MU Corporation when it was in crisis. ”

“If song Shiyu did not love her, why had he married her? ”

“Mu Yourong was tied to a chair, and her gaze had already lost its usual vigor. ”

At this moment.

The scene changed.

“In song Shiyu’s bedroom, song Shiyu stood in front of the French window, his hand holding a polished peach pit. “Don’t worry, I will definitely make Mu Yourong’s life worse than death!” ”

Peach Pit?

Whose Peach Pit was this?

Could it be that song Shiyu had tortured her so much to avenge someone?

But just who had she offended to have song Shiyu treat her like this!

“Just then, Mu Yourong’s gaze caught a glimpse of a photograph. ”

“In that instant, Mu Yourong’s pupils suddenly dilated. ”

It was her!

How could it be her!
