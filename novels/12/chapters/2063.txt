Translator: 549690339

“Man Jiangshan looked at Zhao Dan and continued, “Ye Zhuo knows her identity?” ”

“Zhao Dan shook his head, “I didn’t say it out loud. She didn’t say it out loud either. I don’t know if she knows yet. I just feel that her attitude isn’t right. You weren’t at the scene today. If you were at the scene, you would have been angered to death!”As the mother of a nation, Zhao Dan.., no matter where she went, she would always be high and mighty. When had she ever been ignored like this! ”

“Moreover, the other party was only a little girl! ”

Man Jiangshan narrowed his eyes. “Could it be that she already knows?”

“Otherwise, ye Zhuo would not treat Zhao Dan that way. ”

“Zhao dan continued, “Why don’t I Come Back First?” ”

“”No.”Man Jiangshan shook his head and continued, “You can’t come back for the time being.” ”

“Why?”Zhao Dan asked.

“Man Jiangshan continued, “This matter can not be delayed any longer! It must be dealt with immediately. You Should First Test ye Zhuo’s words and see if she knows her identity. If she doesn’t, you should tell her.” ”

“”What if she knows?”Zhao Dan said, “From her attitude, it seems that she looks down on me as her mother!” ”

“”If she knows, you should think of a way to ask for her forgiveness. After all, we were the ones who let her down back then!”Man Jiangshan continued, “She has been alone for so many years. She must be longing for family ties...” ”

“Hearing this, Zhao Dan seemed to have thought of something and continued, “Oh right, Jiangshan! Today, she told me that she has found her biological parents! Who Do you think is impersonating us?” ”

“Man Jiangshan smiled and said, “There’s no need to pay attention to this matter.” ”

“Ah?”Zhao Dan was stunned.

“Man Jiangshan continued, “It’s obvious that she is trying to trick you! However, it can be seen from here that this child really lacks love. How about this, you go over again tomorrow. If it really doesn’t work, I will go over too. The two of us will beg for her forgiveness together.” ”

“”Beg Her? Why do you need to beg!”Zhao Dan frowned slightly and continued, “She should be the one begging us!” ”

“”A woman’s opinion!”Man Jiangshan said, “Master Cao said that if Xing ‘er wants to achieve great things, she must borrow her power!” ”

“No matter what, Ye Zhuo was the ruler of Chang Yue country. ”

“The people of Chang Yue country were outstanding, and they were in the most advantageous geographical position in the S galaxy. If man Xing had ye Zhuo’s support, it would indeed be able to achieve twice the result with half the effort. ”

“Most importantly, if ye Zao were to recognize them, then in the future, Ye Zao would be their daughter. Changyue would also become a vassal state of Manxing. When the two countries became one, then.., even the General Alliance would be afraid of their entire family. ”

“Did master Cao say this personally?”Zhao Dan asked.

Man Jiangshan nodded.

“Hearing this, Zhao Dan sighed and continued, “Since it was master Cao who said it, then I will do it! Don’t worry, I will definitely not drag Xing ‘er down!” ” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“For the sake of man Xing, she would do anything. ”

“Seeing that Zhao Dan was still able to understand the bigger picture, man Jiangshan also heaved a sigh of relief. “Alright, that’s all for now.” ”

Zhao Dan nodded.

“Man Jiangshan seemed to have thought of something, then, he added, “She’s our biological daughter after all. As a parent, why bother with her own child! “If there’s anything wrong with her, just bear with it for now. After we recognize her back, we’ll let her change it bit by bit. “With Xing ‘er as an example, I believe that she won’t be too bad either.” ”

Manxing was simply a role model for all the girls in Manxing.

“She had set up her own research lab when she was 12 years old. When she was 15 years old, she had been accepted by the International Military Academy. She had always been the biggest pride in Manjiangshan’s heart. ”

“Whenever he thought of his daughter, Manjiangshan’s eyes were filled with smiles. ”

“”Okay, I got it.” ”

“After cutting off his contact information, man Jiangshan leaned back on his chair and took a drag on his cigarette. ”

“At this moment, the sound of the door being knocked could be heard from outside. ”

Man Jiangshan sat up straight and put out the cigarette butt in the Ashtray. “Come in.”

The door was pushed open and the sound of light footsteps could be heard from outside.

“Dad.”

“It was a very pleasant sound, like the collision of jade and stone. ”

“Xing ‘er.”Man Jiangshan turned to look at man Xing.

“Man Xing smiled as he walked behind man Jiangshan and reached out to massage his shoulder. “Dad, MOM has been in Changyue for quite some time. When will she be back?” ”

“Man Jiangshan said, “Your mom still has some matters to settle in Manxing. She might have to wait for a few more days.” ”

“”OH.”MAN XING nodded and continued, “Is mom not back because of elder sister’s matter?” ”
