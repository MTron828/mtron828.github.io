Chapter 80: 073: go to the capital, the anniversary party! 1

Who knows, Sitara YC might not even dare to come to the party.

He was so ugly, and he cheated. Wouldn’t he be embarrassed if he came?

The reason why she made that statement was probably just a delaying tactic to temporarily resolve the urgent matter.

However, whether she came or not, it had nothing to do with him.

His ultimate goal was just to let Cen Shaoqing see the different Mu Yourong.

To let Cen Shaoqing know that Mu Yourong was a perfect match for him!

Whether they were vegetarians or chess players, Mu Yourong and Cen Shaoqing had common topics to talk about.

Cen Shaoqing might not even be a match for Mu Yourong in chess. After all, Mu Yourong was a grandmaster-level master who had participated in competitions and obtained a national certificate!

Therefore, Cen Shaoqing’s true opponent was not that cheating Sitara, but Mu Yourong.

Thinking about how Cen Shaoqing was about to be slapped in the face and how good Mu Yourong was, Li Qiandong’s lips curled up into a faint smile.

When the time came, the face-smacking scene would definitely be very exciting!

Li Qiandong could not wait to see that scene.

“What are you smiling about?”Cen Shaoqing turned his gaze towards Li Qiandong, his deep eyes containing a faint pressure.

Li Qiandong immediately stopped smiling, “Fifth brother, you’re going to meet Sitara soon. Isn’t this something to be happy about? Oh right, the arrangements have been made in the capital. We’ll go there a day earlier. We’ll set off on Wednesday morning.” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and immediately called his secretary to rearrange the schedule.

..

On the other side.

The countdown for the exquisite sound gala had already begun. Lin Sha was also very excited. In the past few days, she had been choosing what gown she wanted to wear to the gala.

After picking out the gowns, Lin Sha went to the Ye family’s house to discuss with Ye Zao.

“Zao Zao, do you think these two gowns I picked out look good?”

Ye Zao smiled and said, “Sister Sha Sha, I have already prepared the gowns for the gala. These are yours. Go and try them on.”

After saying that, ye Zao handed Lin Sha a beige gown.

Lin Shasha took the dress and said in surprise, “Zao Zao, how did you know that beige is my favorite color?”

“Because most of your clothes are beige, I think Sister Shasha will definitely like beige. Go and try it on.”

“Zao Zao, you are so careful.”After knowing ye Zao for So Long, Lin Shasha still did not know what color ye Zao liked.

Lin Sha took the dress and went to the bathroom.

The label of the dress was embroidered with a capital “Z”.

It must be the name of the designer.

The light yellow gauze dress was decorated with white pearls. The fabric was very thin and close to the body, outlining a better body line. However, it felt warm, as if the air conditioner was on.

Curious, Lin Shasha pinched the corner of the skirt to take a look, but the fabric felt no different from ordinary fabric.

Could it be an illusion?

But she did feel that it was very warm now.

“Sear, what material is this dress made of? It’s so warm!”Lin Shasha came out of the bathroom and asked with a puzzled look.

Ye sear said, “This dress has the effect of adjusting the temperature.”

“F * ck! Are you serious?”All this time, clothes that could adjust the temperature only existed in her imagination. Lin Shasha never thought that one day she could have clothes that could have a conditional temperature in reality!

This was too surreal!

Lin Shasha even thought that she was dreaming!

Ye Zao nodded, “If you don’t believe me, why don’t you open the window and try it out?”

Lin Sha didn’t believe him. She went to the window and opened it.

The cold wind blew in through the window.

But Lin Sha didn’t feel cold at all!

Oh My God!

This dress really had the effect of adjusting the temperature.

This was too amazing.

“Zao, where did you buy this dress?”Lin Sha asked.

Ye Zao smiled. “You might not believe it, but I invented it, so you don’t have to buy it.”

Lin sha smiled, “Zao, you’re bragging!”

Although ye Zao was very powerful, she was only eighteen years old.

How could she have invented such a heaven-defying technology?

He must be joking with her.

Ye Zao did not explain.

Lin Sha continued, “By the way, Zao, how much is this dress? I’ll transfer it to you.”

“You don’t have to transfer the money,”ye Zao said in a clear and shallow tone, “Sister Sha Sha, I remember that your birthday is coming soon. This dress is my birthday gift to you.”

“No!”Lin Shasha quickly refused, “This is too expensive! I can’t accept it!”
