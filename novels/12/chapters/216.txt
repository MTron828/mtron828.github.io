“Seeing the paint tag on Whitey’s back, Ye Sen finally believed that Ye Zao wasn’t joking with him. ”

Ye Zao really assembled this himself.

“Using the lowest-end configuration, he assembled the highest-level robot. ”

This niece of his was too amazing!

Ye Sen stared at Whitey and looked left and right.

“Sensing that Ye Sen was staring at it, little white glided back about half a meter. ”

“”Master, I know that I am the most beautiful person in the world, but if you keep staring at me like this, I will be shy!” ”

The most beautiful person in the world?

“Ye Sen:”...”he finally understood why he was familiar with little white before, because he saw the shadow of ye Zhuo in little white. ”

Both of them were so narcissistic.

After dinner.

The two of them set off for the company.

“”Take care, Masters. Be safe on the road. Whitey is waiting for you at home.”Whitey sent the two of them to the door. ”

“Goodbye.”Ye Sen waved at Whitey.

“Goodbye.”Whitey closed the door.

“Looking at the closed door, Ye Sen said in shock, “This robot is too smart! Zhuozhuo, how did you assemble it?” ”

“”It’s very simple! First, write a program, set up the program, and then set up the execution instructions, control instructions, storage instructions, and some other instructions...” ”

“If the equipment was not too simple, she would have assembled a more intelligent sweeping robot! ”

The current Whitey could not be compared to the one-piece robot that she had developed in the past!

“Ye Zao said it simply, but ye Sen was dumbfounded when he heard it. ”

“”Great niece! You’re really amazing!”After a long while, Ye Sen finally managed to squeeze out this sentence. ”

“Ye Zao’s tone was shallow. “It’s just so-so. I’ll make do with it first.”When he had the time, he would improve the equipment and study it in detail. ”

Ye Sen:”...”

Make Do?

Such an intelligent cleaning robot was actually described as just so-so by ye Zao?

He didn’t understand the world of the Big Boss!

“As the two of them talked, the elevator reached the underground garage. ”

Ye Sen took out the keys to unlock the car and opened the driver’s door.

“Ye Zao hadn’t touched the car for a long time, so her hands were itching. ”

Unfortunately.

“She hadn’t taken the driver’s license yet, so she had to sit in the passenger seat. ”

“After the college entrance exam, she had to take the driver’s license exam. ”

Ye Sen’s driving skills were very good.

“Soon, the car stopped at the company headquarters. ”

Ye Zhuo followed behind ye Sen.

“Just as he walked into the company, it caused a heated discussion. ”

“”DAMN! That’s President Ye’s daughter, right? She’s So Pretty! She looks a little like President Ye!” ”

“”Are you stupid! President ye doesn’t even have a girlfriend, where did he get a Daughter?” ”

“I think so...”

“Then who is she?”

Until then.

The young girl who followed behind called him Uncle.

Everyone suddenly understood!

So she was CEO Ye’s niece. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

No wonder she was so beautiful.

Ye Zao followed ye Sen all the way to the office on the third floor. The secretary was sorting out the documents needed for the afternoon meeting.

“Ye Sen introduced ye Zao to the Secretary. “Xiao Hu, this is my eldest niece, Ye Zao. In the afternoon, she will come with us to discuss the cooperation with the person-in-charge of TOAEON company. Go and bring the proposal over for Zao Zao to see.” ”

Xiao Hu was stunned.

How Old was ye Zao?

Eighteen years old?

She could understand the proposal?

Xiao Hu suspected that Ye Sen was teasing her...

“Seeing that Xiao Hu was stunned, ye Sen said again, “Xiao Hu, what are you stunned for? Quickly go and get the proposal!” ”

“”Oh, okay, CEO Ye!”Xiao Hu finally reacted. ”

“Not long after, Xiao Hu came over with the proposal. “Miss Ye.” ”

“”Thank you.”Ye Zao took the proposal with both hands and read through it. Then, she handed it back to Xiao Hu. “I’ve read it well.” ”

Xiao Hu was stunned.

She... she had read it well just like that?

Did she see what was written on the proposal clearly?

“Ye Sen continued, “Zao, do you think there’s anything else wrong with this proposal?” ”

Ye Zao shook his head slightly. “There’s basically no problem.”

“That’s good.”

Xiao Hu was stunned.

She felt that Ye Sen was a little silly.

“Ye Zhonghua was just a child, what did she know! ”

“One dared to ask, the other dared to believe! ”

It was like playing house!

“The agreed time with the other party was three in the afternoon. Ye Sen brought ye Zhonghua and Xiao Hu, and the three of them set off for Toaeon Company at two o’clock. ”

Toaeon was a foreign company.

It had been rooted in China for many years.

“Before this, they had been working with another international express delivery company. But recently, there had been too much negative news about that express delivery company, which affected its positive image. So, they were ready to change to another company. ”

“When Ye Sen and the others arrived, they realized that they were not the only company that came to talk about cooperation today! ”
