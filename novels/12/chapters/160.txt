Chapter 161: 085: Lovely Old Lady Cen, my granddaughter-in-law is the most beautiful woman in the world! 5

Plus, Yunjing was a tourist city, so there were even more people. Ye Zao looked up at the Sun and suddenly regretted not taking a taxi.

At this moment, a man in black quickly ran past ye Zao.

He was very fast.

He was like a gust of wind!

Ye Zao frowned slightly. Before she could react, a middle-aged woman dressed in a light blue qipao and a pair of high heels came from behind. She was dressed exquisitely. “Catch the thief! Catch the Thief!”

Ye Zao immediately understood what was going on. He looked at the middle-aged woman and said, “Auntie, wait here for a moment.”

As soon as he said that, ye Zao immediately chased after her.

She was also very fast.

In a short while, she had forced the black-shirted man into a dead end.

The black-shirted man was so tired that his face was pale. His forehead was covered with layers of hot sweat. He sat on the ground and looked up at Ye Zao. “Hero! Heroine! I surrender...”

“Take out your things.”Ye Zao stretched out his hand towards him. His eyes were very indifferent.

“Alright, wait a moment.”The black-clothed man lowered his head and rummaged through his pockets. “Let me look, let me look.”

Little did he know that his lowered eyes were suffused with a cold and gloomy light.

......

He had debuted for so many years, but he had never suffered a setback.

Today, he would similarly not fall into the hands of a little girl!

Just now, he had intentionally run into this dead end.

Because this dead end was a blind spot for surveillance, and it was also his territory.

This little girl was so beautiful, so she definitely had a better taste!

Thinking of this, a wretched expression appeared on the black-clothed man’s face.

Since she liked to meddle in other people’s business.

Then don’t blame him!

At this moment, the black-clothed man suddenly took out a dagger that flashed with a cold light from his pocket. He stood up from the ground and walked step by step towards ye Zao. At the same time, three to four men wearing black clothes also appeared behind ye Zao, they quietly appeared behind ye Zao and blocked her way back.

The current ye Zao was like a turtle in a jar.

It was difficult to escape from a Super Wing.

Ye Zao crossed her arms in front of her chest.

She just looked at the man in black who was walking towards her.

There was no fear on his face. Instead, there was a faint smile on the corner of his mouth.

The man in black frowned slightly.

Why didn’t she run?

Under normal circumstances, wouldn’t a girl immediately turn around and run when she saw this situation?

Why didn’t Ye Zao Move? Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Could it be that he was scared silly?

It should be.

The black-clothed man walked in front of ye Zao just like that. “Little girl, if you know what’s good for you, spend some time with your brothers today. Your brothers will make you happy. Otherwise... hehehe...”

The people behind him also started to laugh with malicious intentions.

Their eyes were filled with a wretched light.

Ye Zao curled his lips slightly. “Or else what?”

“Is that so?”After saying that, Ye Zao reached out and grabbed the man in black by the neck, lifting him up bit by bit. “It’s still the same? HMM?”

The atmosphere in the air froze at that moment, and the few hooligans behind ye Zao were so scared that their legs went soft.

She, she actually lifted him up!

This was too terrifying!

The black-clothed man’s feet rose into the air, and his face was choked to the color of a pig’s liver.

At this moment, he felt that death was right beside him and could take him away at any time.

“Why aren’t you speaking? Weren’t you able to speak just now?”Ye Zao increased the strength of his hands.

The black-clothed man looked at Ye Zao, his face full of pain and fear. He blurted out a few words, “No, no, I don’t dare...”

He really didn’t dare.

He originally thought that he would meet a little beauty, but he didn’t expect to meet a little raksha.

Ye Zao slowly turned behind him, “What about you guys?”

The few hooligans were scared out of their wits and knelt on the ground, “I don’t dare, I don’t dare. Heroine, please spare my life! Please spare my life!”

Only then did ye Zao slowly let go of the man in black.

“Bang!”

The man fell heavily to the ground, raising a cloud of dust.

“Thank you, Great Aunt! Thank you, Great Aunt!”

“Take out the things.”

The man immediately took out an exquisite handbag from his bosom.

Ye Zhuo took the handbag. “If I find that one thing is missing, do you believe that I have a hundred ways to kill you?”

“Don’t worry, I didn’t take any of the things here.”Did he want to die? How dare he tamper with the little devil?

Ye Zhuo took the handbag and ran all the way to the place just now.

The middle-aged woman in the Cheongsam was still waiting there.
