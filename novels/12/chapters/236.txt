Old Lady Cen’s voice was very loud.

“Mu Yourong, who was walking in front, clearly heard this ‘scumbag’and her brows fiercely furrowed. ”

Damned Old Woman!

She actually dared to treat her like this.

“If Old Lady Cen had acted a little pitiful and humble, perhaps she would have given something to her. ”

Now?

No!

This old lady was not worthy of her charity.

This kind of rundown household deserved to go bankrupt! Deserved to be a lowly person for the rest of her life.

“After knowing old madam Cen for so many days, this was the first time ye Zhuo had seen old madam Cen swear. He asked curiously, “Grandma Cen, do you know her?” ”

“Upon hearing ye Zhuo’s voice, Old Madam Cen immediately seemed to have changed into a different person. Her face was filled with smiles, “Ye, you’re Out! Who knows such a disgusting person! Let’s not talk about her! Right, Ye, don’t you want to take the college entrance exam soon? This is the safety amulet that I begged for for you in the temple. If you carry it with you, you’ll definitely be ranked on the gold roll!” ”

“After saying that, old Mrs. Cen took out the safety amulet and handed it to Ye Zao. ”

It was a yellow safety amulet. The amulet was painted with cinnabar flower.

“”Thank you, Grandma Cen.”Ye Zao took the safety amulet and carefully put it into the pocket of his school uniform. ”

Old Mrs. Cen was very happy to see that ye Zao valued the amulet she gave him so much.

“At first, she was worried that if she gave the safety amulet to Ye Zao, Ye Zao would dislike her for being too superstitious. ”

“After all, the young people nowadays no longer believed in the old ways. ”

Who would have thought that ye Zao did not mind at all!

As expected of her granddaughter-in-law!

A thousand times better than that Scum Mu Yourong! Ten Thousand Times Better! Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Seeing how ye Zao valued the safety talisman given by Old Lady Cen so much, Zhou Xiang did not want to be outdone. She immediately took out a thermos bucket. “Zao Zao, you must be hungry since you went to school, right? This is the sweet soup that I specially got someone to cook for you!” ”

“Upon hearing the sweet soup, ye Zao’s eyes lit up. “Do you have sweet soup? Thank you, Aunt Xiang!” ”

“Zao Zao! There’s no need to be so polite with me!”Zhou Xiang smiled and held ye Zao’s arm. “There’s a fried chicken shop in front. Let’s go in and have a seat. We can talk while eating.”

“Okay.”

Old Lady Cen immediately held ye Zao’s other arm.

The two of them hugged ye Zao and entered the fried chicken shop.

“As school was about to end, there were quite a number of students in the fried chicken shop. ”

Ye Zao used his phone to order.

“Zhou Xiang scooped out the sweet soup and handed it to ye Zao. “Zao Zao, try it quickly. The old chef who cooked the dessert came from Hangzhou. This is their family’s ancestral skill. You Won’t be able to eat it outside.” ”

“Ye Zao took the sweet soup and tasted it. It was slightly sweet and had a hint of mint fragrance. There were also soft and sticky tangyuans in the sweet soup. When he gently sipped it, the juice inside was overflowing. ”

“Zhou Xiang could not wait to ask, “How is it? Is Zao Zao Delicious?” ”

“Delicious!”Ye Zao nodded. “It’s very delicious!”

“Zhou Xiang scooped another bowl for ye Zao. “Zao Zao, it’s good that you like it. Eat more. There’s still a lot inside!” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen looked at ye Zao lovingly. “Yes, yes, yes! Eat More! If it’s not enough, I’ll call someone to send it over! Yezi, look at how thin you are! Are you nervous about the college entrance exam?” ”

“After saying that.., old Mrs. Cen continued, “Isn’t it just one college entrance exam? It doesn’t matter if you don’t do well! Yezi, I heard that you want to take the Beijing University Entrance Exam, right? If the score line is not enough, I’ll donate two teaching buildings to Beijing University. If two buildings are not enough, then three. If three buildings are not enough, then ten. Donate until Beijing University accepts you!” ”

“Zhou Xiang felt that what old Mrs. Cen said was very reasonable, so he echoed her: ”

“”Yes, yes, yes! Zhuozhuo, your Grandma Cen is right. Isn’t it just a matter of a few teaching buildings? Don’t put too much pressure on yourself! It’s not worth it if you tire yourself out! We don’t need that bit of money!” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen and Zhou Xiang spoke very seriously, and there was not the slightest hint of a joke on their faces. ”

They looked as if they were rich and did not lack money. It was as if donating a few teaching buildings was as simple as going to the supermarket to buy two catties of apples.

Ye Zao was shocked by their wealth. He choked on a mouthful of sweet soup and could not help but cough.

“Cough Cough Cough!”

“”Zao Zao, are you okay? Eat Slowly!”Zhou Xiang was shocked and quickly stood up to Pat ye Zao’s back. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen immediately handed ye Zao a tissue and said nervously, “Yezi, are you okay?” ”

“”I’m fine, I’m Fine! I just choked by accident.”Ye Zao took the tissue and wiped his mouth. ”

“Hearing ye Zao say that he was fine, both of them were relieved. ”
