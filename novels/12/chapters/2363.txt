She had not participated in the growth of Ye Zhuo and Lin Ze.

“Now that she thought about it, she could only feel pity. ”

She had been too weak back then.

Old Lady Shangguan was stunned. “What’s going on?”

“Ye Shu continued, “Actually, it’s not a secret. If you want to hear it, I can tell you slowly.” ”

“”Okay, then tell me,”Old Lady Shangguan said. ”

“Ye Shu nodded. Looking at Lin Ze and Bai Jingshu’s figures, she talked about the past many years ago. ”

“When she talked about those things again, there was no hatred in ye Shu’s eyes. ”

“Other than regret, she didn’t hate anyone anymore. ”

“Besides causing trouble for herself, what else could hate bring? ”

“A man lived a lifetime, and the grass and trees grew in an autumn. He was but a white cloud and a gray dog, so there was no need to make things difficult for himself. ”

The current ye Shu had already seen through many things and thought through many things. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“After hearing ye Shu’s words, Old Lady Shangguan was also filled with emotion. ”

It turned out that everyone had a story hidden in them.

“Old Lady Shangguan continued, “Mother Ah Ze, I think you should have heard about me. I have a grandson, Shangguan Yue, who is the same size as Ah Ze. Coincidentally, he looks very similar to Ah Ze...” ”

“The Shangguan family was full of loyal and ardent people. Unfortunately, they did not even leave behind a descendant. ”

Loyal officials had no descendants!

“At the end of the sentence, Old Lady Shangguan’s eyes were already slightly red. ”

“There were a total of twenty-six people in the Shangguan family. In the end, only she, a lonely old lady, was left. ”

“Ye Shu quickly comforted her, “Old lady, don’t think too much. You Still Have Ah Ze in the future. If you don’t mind, you can treat Ah Ze as your own grandson.” ”

“”Thank you, thank you, mother Ah Ze.”Old Lady Shangguan held ye Shu’s hand tightly. She was so touched that she didn’t know what to say when the words were on the tip of her tongue. ”

“Cen Shaoqing stood beside ye Zao and looked enviously at Lin ze and Bai Jingshu, who were toasting among the guests. “Zao Zao.” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao raised his eyes slightly.

“When can we be like Ah Ze and the others?”Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips opened slightly.

“It was too easy to be impulsive to attend a wedding. For example, Cen Shaoqing could not wait to drag ye Zao to a wedding right now. ”

“If ye Zao wore a wedding dress, she would definitely be the most beautiful bride in the world. ”

“”Don’t worry, there will be such a day.”Ye Zao’s voice was shallow. ”

“When will that be?”Cen Shaoqing reached out and hugged her waist. “It’s been a month since you graduated!”

They had agreed to get married after graduation.

“Do you think it’s that easy to get married? You can get married just because you want to?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly.

“”What else do I have to do?”It was Cen Shaoqing’s first time getting married and he did not have much experience. “Leader, as long as it’s what you say, I’ll do it!” ”

“”You have a lot of things to do, such as proposing. Have you proposed?”Ye Zhuo asked. ”

Cen Shaoqing suddenly realized that he hadn’t proposed yet. “I’ll make the arrangements immediately.”

“After saying that, CEN Shaoqing continued, “Will you be able to marry me after proposing?” ”

“”It depends.”Ye Zhuo picked up a dessert and continued, “If you perform well, I’ll reluctantly agree. If you perform average, you won’t be able to get married in this lifetime.” ”

“”Don’t worry, leader. I will definitely give you an unforgettable proposal!” ”

“I’ll wait and see.”Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly.

“Seeing ye Zao eat the next dessert, Cen Shaoqing immediately picked up the cup and handed it to Ye Zao’s lips. ”

Ye Zao opened his mouth and drank a mouthful. The slightly sweet fruit juice in the acid went down his throat and eased the cloying taste in his mouth.

“Whether he should say it or not, the people in Galaxy F enjoyed it much more than those in Galaxy S. ”

“Whether it was desserts or drinks, they were all very delicious. ”

“Unlike the s galaxy, which only knew how to drink that kind of nutrient solution that was difficult to swallow all day long. ”

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Leader, shall we hold a western-style wedding or a chinese-style wedding in the future?” ”

“”A chinese-style wedding,”ye Zhuo said. ”

“She liked the traditional Phoenix Coronet and bridal gown, and the eight-carried sedan chair. ”

“Cen Shaoqing seemed to have seen ye Zhuo wearing the phoenix coronet and bridal gown in front of his eyes. He continued, “I also like the traditional chinese-style wedding. Leader, we are simply a match made in heaven.” ”

“”Mr. Cen, when did your skin become so thick?”Ye Zao turned to look at Cen Shaoqing. ”

“”It’s all because the leader is good at teaching,”Cen Shaoqing replied gently. ”

“Ye Zao:”...”good guy, now he has learned to infer three things from one example. ”

Time passed very quickly.

“In the blink of an eye, it was time for Bai Jingshu to return home. ”

“After returning home this time, she would return to Earth with Lin Ze for a period of time and hold another wedding. ”
