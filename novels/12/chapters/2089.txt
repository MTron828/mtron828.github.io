“Mrs. Duanmu was not the type of person to be muddle-headed. Naturally, she would not allow Duanmu Feng to do such a thing. ”

“Mom! I beg you! I promise that I will not let the Great Elder and the Imperial preceptor discover me.”Duanmu feng tugged at Mrs. Duanmu’s sleeve and began to act coquettishly.

Duanmu Feng was a person who could not sit still and wait for death.

“Rather than being threatened, it was better to take the initiative to attack! ”

“Especially under such circumstances, she could not sit still and wait for death. ”

“”No!”Mrs. Duanmu frowned tightly, “Feng You! You have to understand your current status. How can you go to Earth so easily! Is Earth where you go? Besides, who are the Great Elder and the imperial preceptor? They don’t even give your aunt face!” ”

“Mom!”

Mrs. Duanmu refused to let go.

Duanmu Fengyu was very anxious. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“”Are you going to watch as my position is snatched away?”Duanmu fengyu continued, “Once that woman from Earth is brought up, what will I do?” ”

“Mrs. Duanmu smiled and said, “Silly Child! Do you think that the Imperial preceptor and the great elder are all vegetarians? How can a low-level earthling be worthy of the young master?” ”

“Not to mention the great elder and the Imperial preceptor, even the woman from Earth would be scared to death before she officially arrived in the S Galaxy! ”

“Speaking up to this point, Mrs. Duanmu paused and continued, “If she’s Lucky and really makes it to the s galaxy, she won’t be able to become a proper wife and enter the family! By then, the position of the Chief Alliance’s wife will still be yours!” ”

“But isn’t that annoying?”Duanmu fengyu frowned and asked.

“Mrs. Duanmu smiled and said, “Since ancient times, which successful man hasn’t embraced both sides? Fengyu, you’re indeed more powerful than an ordinary girl, but you’re Only a girl after all. “You, on the other hand, have too little experience. You’ll understand in the future!” ”

“In this world, there was no cat that didn’t cheat. ”

“Rather than guarding the east and guarding the west, it was better to let a man eat it openly. This way, he could gain a good reputation. ”

“Is my father like this?”Duanmu Feng turned to look at Mrs. Duanmu.

“Hearing that.., mrs. Duanmu said, “Since you’ve asked, I Won’t hide it anymore. Your father is also a man. As a man, he will have ambitions and needs. “I don’t care what they do outside as long as it doesn’t affect my position as Mrs. Duanmu!” ”

“Hearing this, Duanmu Fengyu’s worldview completely collapsed. ”

How could she have imagined that her honest father would be like this.

“”Mom, are you lying to me?”Duanmu Fengyu looked at Mrs. Duanmu with pleading eyes. ”

She prayed that Mrs. Duanmu was lying to her.

Her father was not that kind of person.

“Besides, her parents were so loving. Her father would always remember her mother’s birthday. During all kinds of festivals, he would prepare small surprises and gifts for her parents. ”

How could a father who loved his mother so much betray his mother?

No.

No.

It must be fake.

“Mrs. Duanmu looked at Duanmu Fengyu, she sighed and said, “Fengyu, you’re 21 this year, not 11 or 12. I’m telling you this because I want you to know that the world of adults is much more complicated than you think.” ”

All love and splendor were superficial. Only those who had experienced it personally would understand the reasons behind it.

“However, Mrs. Duanmu did not blame Duanmu Liangchen. After all, Duanmu Liangchen had given her everything she wanted. ”

Duanmu Fengyu was stunned and could not react for a long time.

How could this be?

“Mrs. Duanmu reached out and patted Duanmu Fengyu’s shoulder, “Fengyu, you’re right to listen to me. At such a critical moment, don’t go to Earth and get involved. Leave the rest to the great elder and the Imperial preceptor. They will go through the necessary procedures.” ”

“The daughter of the Duanmu family had to become the wife of the General Alliance, which was the necessary procedure. ”

“”Mom, I want to take a gamble,”said Duanmu Fengyu. ”

She didn’t want to live a life of self-deception like Mrs. Duanmu. She wanted her husband to only have her in his heart.

In addition.

She had never met the young master of Dongli.

“She wanted to see if he was worthy of her in terms of looks, apart from his intelligence. ”

“Of course, the most important thing was to make Dongli fall in love with her and forget about that lowly Earth woman. ”

“Their love had no result to begin with, so there was no need to waste time. ”

“Mrs. Duanmu’s face darkened. “If you dare to go, Don’t blame me for not recognizing you as my daughter!” ”
