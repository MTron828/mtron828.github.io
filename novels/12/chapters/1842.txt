“I’m not bragging.”Cen Shaoqing held the steering wheel with one hand. There was a bit of coldness between his clear eyebrows and the small red mole at the bottom of his eyes added a bit of flirtatious feeling.

Ye Zhuo couldn’t be bothered with him. He turned on his mobile phone and logged into the PL website.

PL was the world’s largest ranking website for hypnotists.

“At present, the number one hypnotist was Jiuzhou. ”

Jiuzhou is the most mysterious hypnotist on the website.

It’s a three-without-staff.

“The normal three-without-staff refers to having no house, car, or money. ”

“But Jiuzhou’s three-without-staff refers to having no gender, age, or nationality. ”

“In the entire PL website, no one has ever seen Jiuzhou. ”

“Seeing this, Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly. ”

This Jiuzhou is a little interesting.

“In fact, Ye Zhuo was also somewhat interested in hypnosis, but unfortunately, she couldn’t hypnotize herself. ”

“Otherwise, she wouldn’t need to trouble others. ”

“Do you know nine provinces?”Ye Zhuo turned to look at Cen Shaoqing.

“”I know.”Cen Shaoqing looked ahead and slowly said, “I am.” ”

“”Be serious, I am serious.”Ye Zhuo continued, “I want to use hypnosis to awaken my sealed memories. From the hypnotist rankings, nine provinces is the most suitable for my requirements.” ”

“Hypnosis originated from ancient Greece and had a history of 170 years. Hypnosis used psychological suggestion to put the hypnotized person into a half-asleep state, thus awakening the memories in their subconscious. ”

“I’m also very serious.”Cen Shaoqing looked back slightly and looked at Ye Zhuo. “I’m really nine provinces.”

“Ye Zhuo ignored him and clicked on the information page of nine provinces, trying to find something. ”

“However, the information on the nine provinces was blank. Even ye Zhuo couldn’t find anything. ”

Cen Shaoqing looked at her with a faint smile in his eyes.

On the other side.

The Yu family.

“Yu Zifei had been resting at home for more than half a month. During this half a month, he spent most of his time at home recuperating. ”

“Tian Zhifang saw that Yu Zifei’s spirit was getting better day by day. She was very happy, but when she thought about what happened to Yu Zifei on Mars, she became afraid. ” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Yu Zifei was her only son. No matter what, she couldn’t go through that kind of thing again. ”

That feeling was too terrible!

Tian Zhifang carried the supplements to Yu Zifei’s room.

“Yu Zifei was sitting in front of the computer, looking at the documents sent by his assistant. ”

“Hearing footsteps, Yu Zifei turned around. “Mom.” ”

“Tian Zhifang said, “I made some supplements. Drink it while it’s hot.” ”

“Yu Zifei took the nutrients with both hands and said with a smile, “I’ve been drinking the nutrients you’ve stewed every day for the past few days. If this continues, my nose will bleed.” ”

“Tian Zhifang knocked on the door several times a day. Every time he knocked on the door, it was to bring him food. ”

“Bird’s nest, fish glue, ginseng... ... He wished he could bring all the most nutritious things in the world to him. ”

“”It’s not that exaggerated,”Tian Zhifang said. “I’ve been drinking these things every day, but I haven’t seen you gain any weight.” ”

Yu Zifei was of the lean body type. He had been drinking tonics for more than half a month. But he still hadn’t gained half a pound.

“”I wasn’t born with a fat body.”Yu Zifei smiled, picked up the bowl, and drank all the tonics. ”

“Seeing Yu Zifei drink all the tonics, Tian Zhifang was satisfied. She thought about the words in her heart and continued, “Zifei.” ”

“Huh?”Yu Zifei looked up at Tian Zhifang.

“Tian Zhifang continued, “Mom wants to discuss something with you.” ”

“Go ahead.”Yu Zifei put down the bowl.

“Tian Zhifang looked at Yu Zifei and said, “Zifei, you can withdraw from the OASIS project.” ”

Withdraw from the Oasis Project?

How could that be possible!

“Since Yu Zifei had chosen to join the OASIS project team, he would not give up so easily. ”

“If he chose to quit at this time, then what was the difference between him and a traitor? ”

“Yu Zifei frowned slightly and continued, “Mom, didn’t you say that you would support me?” ”

“Tian Zhifang sighed. “Mars is so dangerous. Mom is afraid of You...”she was afraid that one day, after Yu Zifei went to Mars, he would never come back. ”

“At this point, Tian Zhifang’s eyes were a little red, she said in a hoarse voice, “Zifei, mom would rather you be ordinary and ordinary than to let you take that risk again. Do you know how mom survived those five days when you disappeared on Mars?” ”

“Although the matter had passed, the fear and helplessness left behind were still there. ”

Tian Zhifang still dreamed of that scene many times in her dreams.

“In the dream, Yu Zifei never came back when he was on the second mission. ”
