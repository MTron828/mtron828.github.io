Chapter 182: 087: so it’s Ye Zao! Old Lady Cen is trying to trick Cen Shaoqing! 2

Yezi?

Could it be that ye Zao is the Yezi that Old Lady Cen mentioned?

Little Miracle Doctor?

Granddaughter-in-law?

Holy shit!

It Can’t be?

The world is so small?

This time, it was Zhou Xiang’s turn to be confused.

Old Lady Cen continued, “Let me introduce you to Yezi, the little miracle doctor who cured my head disease. Yezi, this is my daughter-in-law.”

So it really was!

“This world is too small!”Zhou Xiang continued, “Mom, Yezi is the burning burning I told you about!”

Old Mrs. Cen widened her eyes in disbelief.

Fate!

......

Fate!

It was not like a family would not enter the same house.

Ye Zhuo was destined to be her granddaughter-in-law.

Ye Zhuo also felt that the world was quite small.

Before coming back, she had never thought that Zhou Xiang and old Mrs. Cen were a family.

The three of them walked to the main hall as they talked.

Old Mrs. Cen ordered the servants to make tea and then said to ye zhuo, “Yezi, you take a seat first. Grandma has a delicious food for you. I’ll go get it for you now.”

This delicious food was specially left for ye Zhuo by Old Mrs. Cen. It would be more sincere if she went to get it herself!

Ye Zhuo stood up and said, “Grandma Cen, you don’t have to be so polite.”

“No need to be so polite. We Don’t talk about such things between grandfather and grandson! Sit down quickly, I’ll be back soon.”After saying that, he instructed Zhou xiang, “Xiang Xiang, you sit here and accompany Ye Zi!”

Zhou Xiang nodded. “I know.”

Old Mrs. Cen turned around and walked to the backyard, while at the same time, she instructed the servants to call Cen Shaoqing down.

“Meow.”

At this moment, a chubby ragdoll cat jumped onto ye Zao’s body. Its round head rubbed against her body, meowing non-stop.

Ye Zao immediately hugged the cat in his arms and took a big gulp. “It’s so cute!”

Zhou Xiang said in surprise, “Zao Zao, you like Cats Too?”

Ye Zao nodded. “I do.”And I like them very much!

Unfortunately, she did not have time to raise a cat, nor did she have time to walk the cat.

Otherwise, she really wanted to bring a cat to raise.

Upstairs in the study.

Cen Shaoqing was processing documents.

Just then, the sound of a servant knocking on the door came from outside. “Fifth Master, Miracle Doctor Ye is here. The old lady asked me to call you down.”

“Coming.”

Cen Shaoqing responded and finished the last document. He walked downstairs with the pen in his hand.

Before he reached the first floor, he heard Zhou Xiang’s laughter.

Then, he heard a very clear voice.

“Sister Zhou Xiang, does it have a name?”

“Yes, it’s called Big Fatty.”

Sister Zhou Xiang?

Cen Shaoqing was twirling the Buddhist beads. Since when did Zhou Xiang have a sister?

Why didn’t he know?

Moreover.

Why did this voice sound a little familiar to him?

Could it be that he had heard something wrong?

Cen Shaoqing raised his eyebrows slightly and could not help but speed up his footsteps.

He arrived at the first floor.

When he saw the figure sitting on the sofa with a fat cat in his arms, Cen Shaoqing was stunned again.

Ye Zhuo was sitting on the sofa, chatting and laughing with Zhou Xiang. From Cen Shaoqing’s angle, he could see the side profile of the face that looked like a painting.

The wine-red coat made his already fair skin look even fairer at this moment.

This was...

Ye Zhuo?

Didn’t they say that the godly doctor was here?

Why was it ye Zhuo.

Could it be..

Cen Shaoqing’s hand that was holding the Buddha bead paused. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

He felt that he must have been possessed.

Not only did he dream about ye Zao at night...

He was even hallucinating now.

He felt that he needed to find a godly doctor to check his pulse later.

He needed to take some Chinese medicine.

He needed to recuperate.

Zhou Xiang turned around and saw Cen Shaoqing standing there.

“Shaoqing!”

Cen Shaoqing’s expression did not change. His fingertips circled around the Buddha bead as he walked over calmly. “Mom.”

It was not until he was in front of ye Zhuo that Cen Shaoqing realized that he was not hallucinating.

Cen Shaoqing pushed the Buddha beads in his hand forward.

Zhou Xiang continued, “Shaoqing, let me introduce you. This is Miracle Doctor Ye who cured your grandmother’s nipple disease!”

Miracle Doctor Ye?

Cen Shaoqing’s calm eyes showed obvious surprise.

It was fleeting.

He originally thought that the miracle doctor who cured the CEN old lady was an old man who was over 50 years old.

After all, the culture of Chinese medicine was extensive and profound. It would be impossible to understand it without decades of research.

Moreover, since ancient times, Chinese medicine had always been male.

Therefore, before this, Cen Shaoqing had always thought that the legendary miracle doctor was a white-bearded old man.

He did not expect that the other party was actually a teenage girl.

What surprised Cen Shaoqing even more was that this little girl was actually ye Zao.

Ye Zao!

Ye Zao, who was only nineteen years old, was not only a tech guru, a chess master, and an Internet celebrity anchor...

Now, she even had the identity of a godly doctor.

How many aspects of her that no one knew about?
