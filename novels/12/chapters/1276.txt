“Ye Zao smiled and said, “It’s okay. We have a lot of people in our family, so we can definitely finish it. If you don’t want to sell me, I’ll still have to go to someone else to buy it. Grandma, just sell me!””

The old grandma hesitated for a while.

“Ye Zao continued, “You can’t park here. If you continue to hesitate, my ticket will be enough to buy your cart of sweet potatoes.””

“The old lady quickly said, “Alright then! Thank you, Young Lady. I’ve already sold about ten catties today. You can just give me 50 yuan for the rest.””

“Actually, 50 yuan was far from enough.”

“But the young lady wanted to help her, so she couldn’t let a good person be disappointed.”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Then help me wrap them up.”

The old grandma swiftly wrapped the sweet potatoes.

There were three whole bags.

“Ye Zao put the sweet potatoes into the trunk, took out a fifty-yuan note from his wallet, and handed it to the old grandma. “Grandma, take the money and go home quickly. The snow will be even heavier in a while!””

“Thank you!”The old Grandma took the money.

“Seeing the Black Land Rover disappear into the snow, the old Grandma started to pack her things and prepared to go home.”

“At this moment, she suddenly saw a few brand new 100 RMB notes in her change box.”

The old lady picked them up and counted.

There were five notes in total.

500 RMB.

She didn’t need to think to know that this money was definitely left behind by the little girl just now.

No wonder the little girl didn’t say anything when she said that the roasted sweet potatoes cost 50 RMB. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

It turned out that she had secretly left 500 yuan behind.

“For a moment, the old Granny’s eyes turned slightly red.”

“In just half a year, she had experienced the joys and sorrows of this world.”

Until the appearance of this little girl made her believe that there was still warmth and good people in this world.

A good person has a safe life!

“On this side, Ye Zhuo drove back to the hospital.”

“Carrying three big bags of sweet potatoes, ye Zhuo got out of the car and went straight to the nurses’lounge. “Blue One.””

Blue one was the head nurse.

“”Miss Ye.”Seeing ye Zhuo, blue one hurriedly trotted over.”

Ye Zhuo placed three big bags of sweet potatoes on the table. “The weather is quite cold. I’ll treat everyone to roasted sweet potatoes. You take them and share them with everyone.”

“Blue one smiled and said, “Then I really have to thank Miss Ye!””

“In such a cold day, a sweet roasted sweet potato was simply heartwarming and warming to the stomach.”

It had to be said that this miss ye was simply low-key and amiable.

“Although she had cured ye Sen, she did not put on any airs at all.”

“Now, she was even bringing them warm roasted sweet potatoes.”

“You’re welcome.”

“After coming out of the lounge, ye Zao brought the remaining sweet potatoes and walked towards the inpatient department.”

“Just as he got off the elevator, he saw Lin ze leaning against the wall.”

“Brother?”

Lin Ze stood up straight. “You’re back.”

“”Yeah.”Ye Zao nodded slightly and handed Lin ze a sweet potato. “Brother, do you eat sweet potatoes?””

“Actually, Lin Ze didn’t really like eating potatoes, sweet potatoes, chestnuts, and other starchy foods.”

But this sweet potato was handed to him by Ye Zao.

Not to mention sweet potatoes!

“Even if ye Zao handed him a bomb, he would take it without hesitation and eat it.”

“Lin Ze took the sweet potato and carefully tore open the skin of the sweet potato. He took a bite. The pink was sweet and very delicious. “By the way, Zao Zao, I have something to tell you.””

“Okay.”Ye Zao also took a bite of the sweet potato.

“Lin Ze continued, “Uncle has forgiven Zhao Zhenfei.””

“Okay.”Ye Zao’s expression remained the same. He was not too surprised.

This was within her expectations.

“Ye Sen was a good person with a soft personality. He was very similar to ye Shu from before. As long as Father Zhao used a little trick, he would fall into Father Zhao’s trap.”

“You know?”Lin Ze could not help but be curious when he saw how calm ye Zao was.

“”It’s within my expectations.”Ye Zao looked at Lin Ze and continued, “Brother, sweet potatoes are so sweet! Why is there such a delicious thing as roasted sweet potatoes in the world? !””

Lin Ze:”...”

His sister’s thinking was too fast!

It was hard to react.

“While they were talking, the two of them arrived at the ward.”

Father Zhao was talking to Ye Sen.

“Seeing ye Zao come over, Ye Sen quickly sat up. “Zao Zao is back!””

“Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Uncle, do you want to eat sweet potatoes?””

“Yes!”Ye Sen nodded.

Ye Zao handed ye Sen a sweet potato.

“Seeing that Father Zhao was also looking at her, ye Zao silently stuffed the last sweet potato into his coat pocket. “I’ve finished it!””

What he meant was that it was useless for you to look at me!

Father Zhao:”...”did ye Zao think he was blind?
