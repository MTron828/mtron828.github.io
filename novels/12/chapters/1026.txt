“Aunt Lang held the photo, her hands trembling slightly. ”

“Tears dripped down from her eyes, dyeing the photo instantly. ”

Aunt Lang put down the photo and found a color photo in the file bag.

The girl in the photo was about eleven or twelve years old. She leaned on an old man and smiled very happily.

“Because she was at the age of tooth replacement, she was missing two large incisors, which made her look especially funny. ”

“Although she had changed as a girl, Ye Shu’s eyebrows and eyes could be seen in this photo. ”

It turned out that ye Shu was really her daughter.

Aunt Lang burst into tears.

I’m sorry.

It’s all my fault.

“If she had listened to elder Zhang and Cao Wei earlier, she wouldn’t have ended up like this. ”

It was all her fault.

It was all her fault!

Aunt Lang tried her best to hold back the sadness in her heart as she took out a stack of documents from her document bag with trembling hands.

The documents clearly recorded XI Muwen’s itinerary after he lost half a month back then.

“Xi Muwen first went to sea city, then went to Yun capital from sea city. ”

“Finally, he returned to the capital from Yun Capital. ”

“During this period, Xi Muwen stayed in Yun capital for a whole three days. ”

“When Xiao Banyue went missing that year, Xi Muwen was indeed not in the capital. ”

“However, Aunty Lang never thought that Xiao Banyue’s disappearance had something to do with Xi Muwen. ”

They were biological father and daughter!

Biological father and daughter who were connected by blood!

“No matter how bad XI Muwen was, he would never lay a hand on his own flesh and blood. ”

It wouldn’t!

It wouldn’t!

“Aunty Lang’s heart was in a mess. She poured out everything in the document bag and said in a trembling voice, “USB, where’s the USB!” ”

“According to the information, when the fanatic from back then took a video at Yunjing train station as a memento, he accidentally took a photo of Xi Muwen. ”

“Now, the video was in the USB in the document bag. ”

Ye Zhuo had spent quite some time before he found this video on the old photos website of yunjing.

Aunt Lang did not believe that Xi Muwen would lay a hand on her own daughter.

The only thing that could prove XI Muwen’s innocence now was the USB drive.

“As long as she opened the USB drive, she would be able to see whether that person was Xi Muwen or not. ”

“However, Aunt Lang searched the entire document bag, but she could not find the USB drive mentioned in the information. ”

Could it be a mistake?

There was no USB drive at all.

“Just as Aunt Lang heaved a sigh of relief, she suddenly saw a black USB drive on the ground. ”

Aunt Lang bent down to pick up the USB flash drive and inserted her trembling hands into the computer.

“Soon, the video was played. ”

“Although the pixels from thirty-six years ago could not be compared to the current ones, the color quality was still relatively clear. ”

“After the video was edited, three seconds later, she saw a handsome man carrying a child walking out of the crowded train station. ”

“The child was probably in a deep sleep, so her face could not be seen clearly. ”

“However, Aunt Lang immediately recognized it. ”

The man carrying the child was Xi Muwen.

It really was Xi Muwen.

“To prevent herself from seeing wrongly, Aunt Lang manipulated the video and watched it a few times. ” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“However, the scene did not change. ”

This man was Xi Muwen.

The child in Xi Muwen’s arms was half a month old.

“Even if Xi Muwen changed the ye group into XI group, she didn’t think much of it. ”

“At that time, she only wanted to find half a month and didn’t have the heart to manage the group. Even if Xi Muwen didn’t do anything to the ye group, someone else would have done something to the ye group. ”

Instead of letting outsiders take the ye group away.

It was better to let Xi Muwen come.

Xi Muwen was the son-in-law of the Ye family after all.

“So, she had never taken this matter to heart. ”

“Even if others called her stupid, she didn’t care. ”

Because all of this was her own choice.

“If she hadn’t lost half a month, none of this would have happened. ”

Aunt Lang blamed herself for losing half a month.

“So, she was willing to accept all the consequences. ”

Including XI Muwen turning the Ye Group into XI group and taking over the Ye family’s property.

All of this was the punishment she should have received.

“But now, it seemed like all of this was Xi Muwen’s conspiracy. ”

Just like what elder Zhang said.

He sent half a month away to get everything that belonged to the Ye family.

This was because XI Muwen knew that half a month was the fate of ye Langhua and elder Ye.

“If anything happened to half a month, ye Langhua and elder ye would completely collapse. ”

“As expected, after the first half of the month was lost, Ye Langhua and elder ye fell one after another... ”

Xi Muwen was a heartless person!

“When she thought of this, Aunt Lang’s heart ached so much that she couldn’t breathe. ”
