Chapter 63: Dumbstruck

Could this be the same person?

Cen Shaoqing wasn’t sure. Although these two account names were very similar, the prefix was different.

However, Niohuru.YZ should be busy working on the OS system recently, so she shouldn’t have time to play games. Besides, as a tech expert, how could Niohuru not be doing her job and play chess instead?

So, these two could not be the same person.

Maybe it was just a coincidence!

Cen Shaoqing clicked to add Hitara.YZ as a friend in the game.

After waiting for a long time, the other party still did not respond. Cen Shaoqing originally wanted to play with the other party for a few more rounds, but the other party did not respond, so he could only turn off his computer.

Meanwhile, at the Mu residence.

Mu Yourong sat in her bedroom and called out the system. “Can you check Fifth Master Cen’s current favorability rating?”

[No.] The system’s voice sounded. [But Li Qiandong’s favorability rating has already reached 80%.]

Mu Yourong curled her lips. Although she couldn’t find Fifth Master Cen’s favorability rating, she was pleased to know Li Qiandong’s favorability rating.

After all, Fifth Master Cen and Li Qiandong were good friends. Their views should be pretty much the same. One could imagine that Fifth Master Cen must have a very good impression of her now!

Perhaps Fifth Master Cen was starting to investigate her, just like how she was looking up his information.

“Can you find out Fifth Master Cen’s interests and hobbies?”

The system was silent for a moment.

Soon after, a line of words appeared on the control panel in the air.

[Unable to find out the other party’s interests and hobbies.]

“In that case, pull up some information on Ye Zhuo,”Mu Yourong said.

[Sorry! The system is unable to find any information on Ye Zhuo.]

Mu Yourong frowned, “How could this be?”

It was fine if the system could not find information about Fifth Master Cen. After all, Fifth Master Cen was so powerful, but she could not even find out anything on Ye Zhuo. What was going on?

As she recalled of Ye Zhuo’s reaction tonight, Mu Yourong felt a little uneasy.

Could that piece of trash, Ye Zhuo have really changed?

At this moment, Mu Yourong thought of Li Qingyue.

That’s right! She was reborn into this body. She could befriend a lot of noblemen that she couldn’t approach in her previous life! So what if Ye Zhuo had changed? She could still stomp Ye Zhuo under her feet.

Mu Yourong made a call and was ready to discuss with Li Qingyue.

“Hello, the subscriber you are calling has turned off…” A cold electronic voice came from the other end of the line.

‘Turned off?’ Mu Yourong frowned slightly. As far as she knew, Li Qingyue’s phone was never turned off.

It was also at this time that Mu Yourong realized that she had not contacted Li Qingyue for more than a week.

Perhaps Yi Tao had died, so Li Qingyue was busy with the funeral?

That should be it!

After all, Yi Tao’s illness had reached an incurable state.

Thinking this, Mu Yourong heaved a sigh of relief. She decided that that she would contact Li Qingyue after the latter was done with Yi Tao’s funeral!

Anyway, there were some things that couldn’t be rushed.

…

The next morning, Ye Zhuo got up at 5:30am for her morning run.

She arrived at school on time, at 7:20 am.

As she arrived quite early, there weren’t many students in the class, but her deskmate Zhao Pingting had already arrived.

Ye Zhuo took the initiative to greet her. “Good morning, Pingting.”

Zhao Pingting was stunned for a moment before her face turned slightly red. “Y-you’re talking to me?”

“That’s right.” Ye Zhuo nodded. “Aren’t you called Pingting?”

“Good morning,” Zhao Pingting whispered.

Although Zhao Pingting was called Pingting…

Her figure wasn’t graceful at all.

She was 160 centimeters tall and weighed 170 kilograms. She was an extremely fat person. Fat people loved to sweat, and in the summer, their bodies would stink of sweat. As a result, she felt inferior and didn’t have many friends in the class. Usually, not only was no one willing to talk to her, many people even made fun of her.

Some people called her ‘Fatty’, some called her ‘Fat Lady’, and some called her ‘Fat Pig’…

Some even called her ‘Zhu Bajie[1]’.

This was the first time someone called her by her name.

This feeling was a little strange.

Zhao Pingting was not the kind of person who was pretentious. When others called her ‘Fatty’, she was so used to it that she did not feel anything. However, at this moment, she was a little touched.

She thought that since her new deskmate was so beautiful and had such a good figure, she would definitely be difficult to get along with.

She did not expect that the more beautiful a person was, the less arrogant they would be.

Ye Zhuo sat down and began to chew on her buns. “Pingting, have you had breakfast? Do you want to try my buns?”

Zhao Pingting took out her own breakfast. “I… I brought breakfast.”

Ye Zhuo looked over. “Is yours good? Let me have a taste.”

Zhao Pingting was stunned. She was about to ask Ye Zhuo if she was disturbed by the sight of her!

Ye Zhuo reached out and took a small piece. Zhao Pingting brought some small rice cakes. It tasted soft and squishy. Ye Zhuo narrowed her eyes in satisfaction.

“It’s not bad. Have a taste of my Xiaolongbao.” After saying that, she stuffed a Xiaolongbao into Zhao Pingting’s hands.

Zhao Pingting looked at the Xiaolongbao in her hands.

Only then did she realize that her new deskmate really did not dislike her.

Zhao Pingting thanked her sincerely and then ate the Xiaolongbao with Ye Zhuo.

The first class was mathematics.

The teacher spoke as if he was singing a lullaby. Ye Zhuo started to doze off as she listened. It wasn’t long before she fell fast asleep.

“That student who is sleeping, please come up to the stage and solve this math problem.”

After the math teacher finished speaking, everyone’s eyes turned to Ye Zhuo. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

They were laughing at her.

Seeing that Ye Zhuo did not respond, Zhao Pingting pushed Ye Zhuo and said in a low voice, “Zhuo Zhuo, the teacher asked you to go up to the stage to solve the problem.”

“He asked me?” Ye Zhuo raised her head and looked at Zhao Pingting. There was a faint layer of tears in her eyes.

“Yes.” Zhao pingting nodded.

Ye Zhuo stood up and walked toward the podium.

The mathematics teacher had a look of disappointment on his face. “You’re already in the third year of high school, not the third year in elementary school! Why are you still fool around like this every day? If you want to sleep, go home and sleep!”

Ye Zhuo picked up the chalk and wrote a solution first. Then, he hesitated for a moment.

The mathematics teacher continued, “Look! You can’t solve this problem, right? This is the consequence of sleeping in class! If you can solve this problem, you can sleep as much as you want in my class in the future!”

“Teacher, are you serious?” Ye Zhuo looked back slightly.

“If you can’t solve it, you can always stand in my class in the future!”

Ye Zhuo smiled slightly. “Teacher, I’ll take you as a man of his word. You can’t take back what you’ve just said.”

The math teacher was a little speechless. Was this student dreaming? This problem was an Olympiad math problem. It was considered difficult for the average third year high school student, not to mention someone like her!

Even the top students of the ace class would find it difficult to solve it!

‘Sigh! The students nowadays are really too much! It is really too difficult to be a teacher nowadays.’

The mathematics teacher turned around and looked at the students below the stage, then he earnestly said, “Grade 12 is a turning point in life. I hope that all of you can work harder and strive for a good future for yourselves. When you get to university, you can play however much you want! Don’t be like this student who doesn’t make any progress. If you sleep in class, you won’t be able to learn anything. When the time comes, you will regret it…”

At this moment, Ye Zhuo began to write and solve the questions.

The students below the stage looked at Ye Zhuo with their mouths agape.

‘F*ck!

‘Is this really that Ye Zhuo who doesn’t know anything?’

The mathematics teacher thought that his words had awakened the group of children and nodded in satisfaction.

It seemed that these children were not hopeless.

“Teacher, I’ve done it.”

At this moment, Ye Zhuo’s voice sounded.

‘Done?

‘So fast?

‘Could she have written a bunch of nonsense?’

The math teacher was just about to teach Ye Zhuo a good lesson, but when he turned around, he was completely stunned.

Not only did Ye Zhuo solve the problem, but he also used the simplest method to solve the problem.

Her handwriting was very beautiful. Her strokes were well-controlled, even better than his, the teacher’s, handwriting.

Was his eyes playing tricks on him?

The mathematics teacher rubbed his eyes in disbelief, but the scene in front of him did not change.

Ye Zhuo continued, “Teacher, this problem is a little out of the ordinary, so I used the solution method that I learned from studying college level mathematics.”

“You… You did this?” The mathematics teacher looked at Ye Zhuo in disbelief.

Ye Zhuo nodded. “Can I go back to my seat now?”

“Wait!” The math teacher picked up the materials on the table and quickly wrote a different question on the blackboard. “Solve this question.”

The math teacher did not believe that Ye Zhuo was the one who wrote the solution.

Just as Ye Zhuo said, the question was a little difficult. How could Ye Zhuo be so good at it?

Could she have copied the answer from his phone when he was not paying attention?

Ye Zhuo picked up the chalk. “Alright.”

This time, the mathematics teacher did not even dare to blink his eyes. He just stared at Ye Zhuo until Ye Zhuo finished solving the question.

Amazing!

This was simply too amazing!

The mathematics teacher calmed himself down and asked, “What’s your name?” He did not expect his class to have such a good seedling!

“Teacher, my name is Ye Zhuo.”

“You’re Classmate Ye who transferred from the ace class next door?”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Yes.”

The math teacher had heard of Ye Zhuo before this. Didn’t they say that Ye Zhuo was an idiot?

If she was an idiot…

Then what was he?

Dog sh*t?

‘Oh my god! If the class teacher of the ace class, Qian Dabao, knew that he had mistakenly thrown away a pearl, thinking that it was a fish’s eye, he would regret it so much!’
