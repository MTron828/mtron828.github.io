“Chenyu!”Ye Zhuo immediately reached out to pull song Chenyu. He turned to look at the director. “Chenyu fell! Quickly call the medical team over!”

“Director Feng was so scared that he hurriedly threw away the cigarette butt in his hand. He ran over and asked, “Is Chenyu Alright?””

“It might be a little troublesome.”Ye Zhuo pulled song chenyu out of the ditch. “Is the medical team here?”

Song Chenyu’s face was covered in blood. He had already fallen into a coma and looked a little scary.

“Director Feng was scared out of his wits. He held the walkie-talkie and said, “Hurry Up! The medical team, Hurry Up! Someone is going to die soon!””

“At this moment, the medical team ran over with a stretcher.”

“After the medical team’s examination, they found that the injury on song Chenyu’s forehead was more serious. After a simple treatment, the ambulance took song Chenyu to the hospital.”

“Song Chenyu had an accident, so the program team could only stop filming.”

“Song Chenyu was quite popular in the entertainment circle. Moreover, “Country”was a popular variety show. When they learned that song Chenyu was hospitalized because of his injury while filming “Country”, many entertainment reporters immediately came over to watch the filming.”

Everyone wanted to get first-hand information.

“The entertainment industry was always a place to listen to rumors. Soon, news of Chenyu song’s critical condition spread across the internet.”

The comments on Chenyu song’s Weibo were all praying for peace.

“[ Chenyu, you must be well. ]”

“[ it’s too sudden. Yesterday, my sister was still posting news about children left behind. Today, something happened. ]”

[ I’m still looking forward to my sister’s second episode. ]

[ How’s My Sister? Is she out of danger? ]

“Suddenly, there was a sudden change in the style of a comment. [ why did Chen Yu get injured? Please tell us the truth! Release the video of Chen Yu’s injury! ]” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The following comments changed.

[ I heard that Chen Yu was with a certain internet celebrity when he got injured. ]

“[ F * ck! ]! This is a very big story! When I watched the first episode, I felt that there was something wrong with these two people. A certain internet celebrity clearly knew Chen Yu, but he didn’t take the initiative to attack him. He was extremely arrogant! I didn’t expect that Chen Yu would be injured before the second episode was released. ]”

“[ now that the person above said that, I rewound the first episode and watched it again. It’s really not right! ]”

“Please tell us the truth!”

“Release the video of Chenyu’s injury!”

“The situation became more and more serious. In the end, the program team’s official account was attacked by song Chenyu’s fans.”

Director Feng paced back and forth anxiously.

“However, when song Chenyu fell into the ditch, their cameras did not capture the specific process at all. They only captured the backs of the two people.”

“To be precise, it was ye Zhuo’s back. However, if such an unclear video was posted, it would only confirm the speculations of the netizens.”

“Since he could not post the video, director Feng could only post a Weibo to clarify:”

“Feng Youde V: [ Chenyu had an accident during the recording of the program, causing her face to be injured. We are also very sad. Now, our program team is actively cooperating with the Doctor’s treatment plan. This incident was purely an accident. Please don’t make random guesses. I wish Chenyu a speedy recovery. We are all looking forward to her triumphant return. ]”

“[ if it was an accident, why don’t you dare to post the video? Didn’t you shoot the entire recording when you were recording the program? ]”

[ trash program team! ]

[ please make the video public! ]

“Song Yiwan looked at the situation on Weibo, slightly curved her lips, and began to edit Weibo.”

“Song Yiwan v: [ this photo was secretly sent to me by the program team staff. In order to prevent him from being implicated, I won’t say who he is here! Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to prevent the tragedy from happening in time! After the incident, I thought that the person involved would take the initiative to admit his mistake, but he didn’t! From the beginning to the end, she didn’t say sorry to sunfish! She didn’t say anything else. Everyone, just look at the picture. Justice might be late, but it will never be absent [ photo jpg ]”

“In the picture, it was the exact moment song Chenyu fell. From the photo taken by song Yiwan, it looked like ye Zao had pushed song Chenyu Down.”

It had to be said that song Chenyu’s timing was just right.

“There were many people on the internet who were paying attention to song Chenyu’s injury. Plus, Song Yiwan posted it on her account. She already had 20 million fans.”

“The moment she posted it on Weibo, it was trending.”
