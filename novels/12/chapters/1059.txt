“”Yes, let us give you a good bow!”The other two immediately nodded in agreement. ”

“”You Are Our Savior. Forget about bowing, even kneeling on the ground and kowtowing is nothing.” ”

“At this point, if ye Zao refused again, it would seem that he had other intentions. He couldn’t really let them kowtow to her. ” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The three of them stood in front of ye Zao and bowed to him solemnly.

“After bowing, the short-haired girl turned around and looked at the others. Her eyes were cold. “Sisters, it’s time for us to take revenge!” ”

“After saying that, the short-haired girl walked to the Bald Man, and the other two followed her. ”

“The three of them stood in front of the Bald Man. A strong shadow cast on the Bald Man, and a strong sense of hatred exploded from his body. ”

“The bald man looked up at the three of them and could not help but gulp. He wanted to step back, but his body was tied to the leg of the table, so he could not take a step back. ”

“At that moment, the three of them seemed to have made an agreement. They picked up the steel pipe on the side and began to smash the Bald Man. ”

“Bang, Bang, Bang — ”

Every hit used up all the strength in their bodies.

Zhao Pingting also joined in.

“The Bald Man, who was originally silent, could not help but wail in pain. ”

It hurt!

It was too painful.

He never dreamed that he would one day fall into the hands of a group of women.

“After a few seconds, the bald man turned into a pig’s head. ”

“You guys are almost done venting your anger. Quickly stop.”

“At this moment, a pleasant voice came from the air. ”

“The four of them stopped and looked up at Ye Zao, their eyes full of confusion. ”

Even Zhao Pingting was very confused. She did not understand why ye Zao would plead for mercy for this kind of scum. This kind of scum should be beaten to death!

“Zao Zao?”

“Ye Zao did not explain. He picked up a syringe and squeezed the excess air out of the syringe. He walked to the Bald Man’s side. Before the bald man could react, the thin needle had already pierced into his flesh, ye Zao quickly squeezed the medicine in the syringe and pulled out the needle. ”

“Zhao Pingting knew that ye Zao was skilled in medicine and subconsciously thought that ye Zao was treating the bald man. She asked in disbelief, “Zao Zao, are you treating him?” ”

Zhao Pingting knew that doctors were benevolent.

“As a doctor, she could not watch a living person die in front of her. ”

But this bald man had done so many bad things. He should die!

Ye Zhuo shook his head slightly. “It’s not treating a disease.”

Ye Zhuo was not a saint who would treat a devil.

A doctor’s heart was for the right person.

This kind of trash was not worthy.

“Hearing this, Zhao Pingting heaved a sigh of relief. ”

It was good that he was not!

She knew that ye Zhuo was not the kind of good person who was overflowing with sympathy.

The short-haired girl looked up curiously. “Then what did you inject him with?”

“”The medicine used for chemical castration.”Ye Zao continued, “The police will be here soon. Don’t continue to fight. It’s not worth it to have someone’s life on your hands for such a piece of trash.” ”

Chemical castration!

“Hearing this clearly, the short-haired girl’s eyes lit up. “You’re saying that the medicine you injected him with just now can make him a eunuch?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“The short-haired girl continued, “It’s just a small tube of medicine. Will it really work?” ”

“Zhao pingting quickly said, “It will work! It will definitely work! My Friend is a very powerful doctor. If she says it will work, it will definitely work!” ”

The bald man who was tied to the ground also realized what chemical castration meant and began to struggle violently!

Become a eunuch?

He didn’t want to become a eunuch!

“B * Tch! I’m going to kill you!”The Bald Man’s facial features were terrifying. “I’m going to kill you B * tches!”

“Ye Zhuo lowered his eyebrows slightly, and his tone was so cold that it made people’s Hearts Shiver. “Do you know what a pig killing buckle is? I advise you to save your strength.” ”

“A pig killing buckle, as its name implied, was a rope used to tie pigs when they were slaughtered in the past. The more they struggled, the tighter the rope would be. ”

“The bald man refused to believe it and continued to struggle violently. However, after a few seconds, he felt that something was wrong. The rope on his body was getting closer and closer. The rope was so tight that he could hardly breathe! ”

“This time, he did not dare to move recklessly. He collapsed on the ground like a dead pig. ”

“A moment later, an earth-shattering siren sounded from the ground. ”

More than ten police officers broke through the door.

“Burning!”Anlizi ran in with the police from outside. “Are you okay?”
