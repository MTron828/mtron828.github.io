“Chapter 393: 116: a forceful slap in the face, the secret exposed. So Old Lady Cen is fifth Cen’s grandmother! 3”

She simply couldn’t do something that would deceive others!

“He ziteng looked at Mu Yourong, “Brother, don’t be angry if I say something. I don’t think that woman is a good person. Look at her, she’s like a little lotus. She clearly doesn’t know how to race, yet she still pretends to be pitiful! To be honest, it’s quite disgusting!” ”

He ziteng was not quite the same as Li Qiandong.

“Li Qiandong had a tender heart, but he ziteng did not. ”

“If Li Qiandong was a warm man, then he ziteng was a straight man! ”

He really did not like girls who would cry at any time.

“After he said that, he ziteng paused and added, “Also, fifth brother treats you so well. No one can suspect that fifth brother lied to you!” ”

Perhaps it was because he had a life-and-death relationship with Li Qiandong in the middle east.

“Therefore, Cen Shaoqing was really very good to Li Qiandong. ”

“Back then, when the Li Corporation was on the verge of bankruptcy, Cen Shaoqing had invested in it! ”

“Without Cen Shaoqing, how could the current Li Corporation exist? ”

Li Qiandong had no reason to suspect that Cen Shaoqing lied to him!

“Li Qiandong was stunned. “But fifth brother really lied to you! Also, yourong is not some little white lotus. She is a very good and kind person! There is no person in this world who is kinder than her!” ”

“He ziteng patted Li Qiandong’s hand and said meaningfully, “Brother, I finally understand why fifth brother said you were stupid!” ”

He could not understand such a simple reason. He was really a little stupid!

It was really difficult for Cen Shaoqing to tolerate him until now.

“Thinking about it, if they did not have that friendship in the Middle East, Cen Shaoqing would probably have been unwilling to pay attention to Li Qiandong long ago. ”

Li Qiandong also didn’t know how blessed he was.

“”Alright, I’m going to look for fifth brother, so I won’t talk to you anymore.”After saying this, he ziteng followed Special Assistant Zhou and left. ”

“Li Qiandong stood on the spot and looked at he ziteng’s back, sighing deeply. ”

He didn’t understand why everyone didn’t believe Mu Yourong.

This feeling of being misunderstood by others was really too unbearable!

“Li Qiandong turned to look at Mu Yourong and said very apologetically, “Yourong, I’m sorry...” ”

He did not know that things would turn out like this.

“Mu Yourong sniffed and said with red eyes, “It’s Alright, Big Brother Li, as long as you still believe in me.” ”

“Seeing Mu Yourong like this, Li Qiandong suddenly had the urge to hug her in his arms, but he could not. ”

Although CEN Shaoqing now had a misunderstanding about Mu Yourong.

“But he believed that one day, these misunderstandings would be resolved. ”

He couldn’t touch Mu Yourong.

“Li Qiandong looked at mu yourong and said emotionally, “Yourong, don’t worry. No matter what happens in the future, I will stand behind you.” ”

Mu Yourong nodded emotionally. “Okay.”

She did not expect he ziteng to not believe her.

“Right now, only Li Qiandong was completely devoted to her, so she had to firmly hold onto Li Qiandong! ”

“Let Li Qiandong, this stepping stone, play its greatest role. ”

“Thinking of this, Mu Yourong took the initiative to walk to Li Qiandong’s side and stretched out her hand to hug Li Qiandong. ”

Li Qiandong was stunned.

His heart was beating rapidly.

“Although he really did not want to admit it, he seemed to have really fallen in love with Mu Yourong. ”

“”Yourong, don’t worry. I will definitely think of a way to save Uncle Mu and bring the MU corporation back to Life!” ”

“Mu Yourong tightened her arms. “Brother Li, thank you.” ”

“With this idiot, Li Qiandong, there was no need for her to worry! ”

“Since Li Qiandong liked her so much, he would definitely think of a way to save soldier Mu and the Mu Corporation! ”

...

He ziteng came to the CEN Corporation.

“Cen Shaoqing was having a meeting in the conference room, so he ziteng could only sit in his office and wait for him. ”

“About an hour later, Cen Shaoqing came out of the conference room. ” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Fifth brother.”

“When he saw Cen Shaoqing, he ziteng immediately stood up from his stool. ”

Cen Shaoqing turned the Buddhist beads in his hand. “Did you see the video?”

“”I saw it! My Idol is too awesome! Fifth brother, thank you. If it wasn’t for you, I would have been deceived by that Mu Guy.”He ziteng was now very glad that he had come to find Cen Shaoqing yesterday, he had told Cen Shaoqing about this matter. ”

“Otherwise, he would have been deceived by Mu Yourong and Li Qiandong right now! ”

“He and Li Qiandong had been good brothers for many years. If Cen Shaoqing had not sent over the surveillance footage in time, he would never have believed that Li Qiandong would lie to him. ”

He would never have thought that Li Qiandong would be fooled by a woman.

“Where’s that idiot?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“He ziteng was stunned for a moment before he realized who the idiot Cen Shaoqing was referring to was. He continued, “Qiandong is still by Mu Yourong’s side. Even now, he still doesn’t believe that Mu Yourong would lie to him.” ”
