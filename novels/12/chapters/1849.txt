“Chapter 1850: 378: Face slapping, scumbag he regrets! 1”

Translator: 549690339

The pendant’s chain is made of silver.

The pendant is a piece of jade in the shape of a water drop.

“Under the light of the Crystal Lamp, the transparent jade sparkles with a rainbow-colored light. ”

It is especially beautiful.

“For ordinary people, this may be just an ordinary pendant, but for hypnotists, this is an indispensable tool in the hypnosis process. ”

This item was called the spirit pendulum.

The spirit pendulum originated in the ancient west and had a long history.

“It was a divination tool that could be compared to a tarot card. It was later used to search for missing persons, energy, water sources, and detect the aura of the human body and the health of animals and plants. ”

“Usually, the spirit pendulum used by a hypnotist was mainly made of crystals because the crystals carried a special magnetic field that could awaken the subconscious in the human body. ”

“However, Cen Shaoqing used jade. ”

Jade was different from crystals.

“In terms of Feng Shui, Jade was Yin. Although it could communicate with spirits, it was extremely difficult to control. The slightest carelessness would cause the jade to bite back. ”

Cen Shaoqing was the first hypnotist who used Jade to make a spiritual pendants. He was also the first hypnotist who could control jade.

“Whether it was in the country or abroad, there was no precedent of using jade to make a spiritual pendants. ”

Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly and recognized the jade on the spirit pendulum at a glance.

“Are you using Black Jade?”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Let me take a look.”

Cen Shaoqing put away the spirit pendulum and handed it to Ye Zhuo.

“Ye Zhuo took the spirit pendulum and held it in his hand to examine it for a while. Then he said, “This spirit pendulum has some history, right?” ”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “It has been passed down to me for nearly five hundred years.”

“Five hundred years?”

“Yes.”

“Who is your master?”Ye Zhuo asked curiously.

Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted slightly. “An old man with a strange temper.”

Cen Shaoqing was twelve years old when he first came into contact with the spirit pendulum.

“The old man had taught him for three years. Later, he disappeared for no reason. ”

“Up until now, Cen Shaoqing had never seen him again. ”

Even the famous domestic and foreign detectives could not find any trace of the old man.

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and leaned against the back of the chair. “I’m ready. Let’s begin.”

Cen Shaoqing held the top of the spirit pendulum and let the pendant at the bottom of the spirit pendulum swing freely.

Once.

Twice.

Only the swaying spirit pendulum was left in ye Zhuo’s eyes.

“When he was tired, ye Zhuo slowly closed his eyes. He was in a daze. At this moment, ye Zhuo’s surroundings were in a state of chaos. He could not see or hear anything. ”

“Miss Ye! Miss Ye!”

“At this moment, a gentle female voice came from the air. ” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Ye Zao frowned slightly. When he opened his eyes, he saw a familiar yet unfamiliar face. In the next second, a name appeared in ye Zao’s mind. ”

Zhong Li.

“Zhong Li, 28 years old. ”

He had followed ye Zao since he had just graduated. It had been six years since then.

“Little Zhong.”Ye Zhuo almost blurted out.

“Zhong li smiled and said, “It’s cold outside. Miss Ye, you can go inside and rest.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo stood up and walked into the office.

“When he walked into the office, zhong li said, “Miss Ye, you can rest first. I’ll call you at 10:30.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and looked down at the schedule on the table. She found that her schedule was very full during this period of time.

There was almost no free time.

At this moment.

Ye Zao found three words on the calendar.

Changyue Country!

Where was changyue country?

“In Ye Zao’s memory, even if humans moved away from Earth later, their nationality was still China. ”

“However, on the schedule, it was written. ”

“CHANGYUE country, year 3108, November 21st. ”

In a flash.

Ye Zao found another problem.

“Currently, the planet she was on was actually planet E-TY889, which was outside the Milky Way. ”

Outside the Milky Way?

Ye Zhuo frowned slightly.

“In her previous life’s memories, although human civilization had developed rapidly, it had not developed beyond the Milky Way. ”

What was going on?

What she was seeing now was too different from what she remembered.

They were completely different memories.

And she had no impression of planet E-TY889 at all.

“At this moment, there was a knock on the door. ”

Ye Zao pressed her temples and opened her red lips. “Come in.”

“Sis.”A tall man walked in.

“He was very tall, almost 1.8 meters. He had exquisite eyebrows, was sunny and handsome, and had a smile on his face. ”

Who was this person?

“Ye Zhuo was stunned. Unlike the situation when she met Zhong Li, she did not immediately remember this person’s name. ”

Sister.

He called her sister.

Could it be that she once had a younger brother?

“”Ye Han, you’re here.”Ye Zhuo almost blurted out. ”
