Who In Chang Yue didn’t know Miss Ye?

As for the autumn flute.

“In the Great Elder’s view, she couldn’t even compare to a single strand of ye Zhuo’s hair. ”

“Hearing this, the other clan leaders all nodded. ”

“Hearing this, what the great clan leader said actually made a lot of sense. ”

“Since this authority was personally set by Ye Zhuo, other than ye Zhuo himself, no one else could open it. ”

“”What if...”the eight clan leaders hesitated for a moment before continuing, “What if the autumn flute is the Phoenix Life?” ”

The person with the Phoenix Life didn’t need the authority to be able to open the information of the inter-star table.

“As soon as these words were said, the surroundings burst into laughter. ”

Phoenix Life?

Autumn flute?

“”If the autumn flute was the phoenix life, the Qiu clan wouldn’t be in this state now.”The three clan leaders said. ”

“In the Chang Yue country, there was only one person who had the phoenix life. ”

And that was ye Zhuo.

“Although ye Zhuo had gone, in the hearts of the clan leaders, Ye Zhuo had always been there! ”

She had only temporarily disappeared.

“One day, Ye Zhuo would return. ”

“With that said, the eight clan leaders felt at ease. ”

“”Great clan leader, since there are no problems with the information on the trans-star case, then why did you summon all of us here? Is there something important you want to say?”The Four clan leaders asked. ”

“The great clan leader stroked his beard and continued, “The thing is, Ye Han beside Miss Ye... seems to have betrayed us!” ”

Ye Han betrayed them?

Impossible!

“The second clan leader was the first to stand up, “Even if all of us betrayed Miss Ye, group leader Ye wouldn’t betray her! Great clan leader, you must be mistaken!” ”

Who Was Ye Han?

“He had followed ye Zhuo since he was fourteen years old, and he respected ye Zhuo even more than his own sister. Most importantly, Ye Han’s life was given to him by Ye Zhuo. He had followed ye Zhuo through life and death several times. Such a person.., how could he betray ye Zhuo? ”

Impossible!

This was absolutely impossible.

“The third clan leader and the fourth clan leader also stood up, “Great clan leader, don’t joke around. How could ye Han betray Miss Ye!” ”

The seven clan leaders and eight clan leaders also felt that ye Han would not betray ye Zhuo.

“The fifth clan leader was calm. He raised his head to look at the first clan leader, “First clan leader, do you know something?” ”

“The first clan leader nodded, “Ye Han personally came to retrieve the transstellar table. Moreover, he changed his surname. His surname is now Wu, and his name is Wu Han.” ”

“The fifth clan leader frowned slightly, “Wu Han? Did you mistake him for someone else?”Even though he did not get along with Ye Han much, he knew that ye Han was not the kind of person who would easily betray, let alone change his name. ”

Ye Han didn’t need to do this at all.

“It was one thing to say that ye Zhuo and ye Han were very harsh, which was why ye Han had the intention to betray them. ”

But Ye Zhuo treated ye Han very well.

Ye Han had no reason to do this at all.

“The first clan leader sighed. “I also hope that I got the wrong person, but the truth is the truth.” ”

“As he finished speaking, the first clan leader opened the surveillance footage from yesterday. ”

“On the big screen, who else could it be but ye Han? ”

“Not only his appearance, even his expression and actions were the same. ”

“This is too similar!”

“Perhaps it’s just his appearance. Leader ye is extremely loyal to Miss Ye. I believe that he would never betray Miss Ye.”

“I also feel that this isn’t Ye Han.”

“”Head chief, you must be mistaken. He said himself that his surname is Wu and not ye.” ”

“”There are nearly two billion people in changyue. It’s not strange for someone to look like Ye Han, right? Head Chief, you can’t think that Wu Han is team leader ye Han just because he looks the same.” ”

“There was no special expression on the head chief’s face. “Everyone, Keep Reading.” ”

“At this moment, ye Han suddenly took out the Emei Thorn. ”

“Seeing this scene, everyone’s expression changed. ”

Emei Spike.

This was ye Han’s exclusive weapon.

“In the Chang Yue country, besides Ye Han, the only person who could use the emei spike was ye Han. ”

Could it be.

This was really ye Han!

“”Now, do you still think that he isn’t Ye Han?”The head clan leader continued to speak. ”

“The eight clan leaders licked their lips, “Miss Ye’s matter happened too suddenly. Could it be that someone wanted to divert their attention and purposely found someone who looked like Ye Han, grooming him to use the emei spike, causing us to have internal strife?” ”

The eight clan leaders still did not believe that ye Han would do such a thing.

That was ye Han!

He had fought side by side with ye Zao countless times.

“If ye Han really did something that betrayed ye Zao, then it would be too chilling! ” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Moreover, ye Zao had always had a good eye for people. She definitely would not misjudge ye Han. ”

It would not.

“Time passed by minute by minute. Very soon, the surveillance footage showed ye Han showing ye Zao’s portable system. ”
