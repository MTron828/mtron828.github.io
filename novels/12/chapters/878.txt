She and Yin Wei worked well together.

“One washed vegetables for a living, while the other cut and fried vegetables.”

“[ I thought these two would blow up the kitchen, but I didn’t expect them to work so well together. ]”

[ Yezi is really a treasure girl. ]

“[ holy shit, I didn’t see song Chenyu cooking in the trailer, it was Yezi... ]”

[ I can smell the aroma of the dishes through the screen. ]

“Soon, four dishes and a soup were served.”

Wei Xingzhi raised his cup and Toasted Ye Zao with Chang Yu.

“Ye Zao also stood up with his cup. “Thank you, teacher Wei. Wei Wei, Chang Yu, I’m not the only one who has worked hard. You guys have worked hard too. This toast is for all of us.””

[ F * ck! Little Sister’s EQ IS REALLY HIGH! ]

[ yezi really knows how to talk. ]

[ I really love this kind of Yezi. ]

[ Yezi’s dishes are too delicious! I think teacher Wei even let go of the gravy! ]

[ I want to eat too! ]

“After the blue team finished eating, the red team started eating.”

The Red Team was cooking with song Chenyu.

[ why do I feel that Lu Qi’s expression is weird when he eats the vegetables? ]

“[ Lu Qi isn’t the only one who’s weird. If you look closely, you’ll find that song Yiwan and Wang Xuancheng are all weird. ]”

“[ the vegetables shouldn’t have been washed clean, right? ]”

[ look at 78 minutes and 25 seconds. The fish in the bowl wasn’t cut open at all! Doesn’t song Chenyu know how to Cook? Why didn’t he even cut open the fish? ]

[ I especially went back to take a look. The belly of the fish was indeed not cut open. ]

[ no wonder everyone’s expressions were so complicated... ]

[ song Chenyu’s character is a little broken. ]

“[ compared to the red team’s leaf, Song Chenyu isn’t just a little inferior. ]”

[ I was looking forward to Song Chenyu. ]

“[ song Chenyu herself ate in pain. Although her acting skills are pretty good, I still saw it from her expression. ]”

The scene changed and it was time for ye Zhuo to steam the lotus cake.

“[ miss, you really can eat! You just ate, and now you’re eating dessert! ]”

“[ this is the real foodie, right? ]”

“[ song Chenyu said that she was a foodie, but in the end, she didn’t even finish half a bowl of rice. ]”

“Soon, the camera turned to the next morning.”

Ye Zhuo woke up very early. The first thing he did after washing up was to go out for a run.

“”Miss, you’re up early.””

After coming back from the jog

He started to prepare breakfast for everyone.

“”Compared to the blue team next door, the Red Team is as carefree as if they’re on vacation.””

“”Song Chenyu seems to be still sleeping, right?””

“I really envy the members of the Red Team. They can have such a good yezi.”

“Lu Qi and the rest of the blue team must be regretting it to death. They really thought that song Chenyu would bring them to a feast. They didn’t expect that song Chenyu couldn’t even wash the dishes clean.”

[ I’m going to pay attention to Yezi’s Miao Yin account! ]

“[ F * CK, F * CK, F * ck! It’s really Yezi! ]”

“[ Yezi, you actually secretly participated in ‘village’. ]”

“[ I was wondering why Yezi didn’t broadcast live a while ago, so he’s participating in a variety show. ]”

“[ he’s coming, he’s coming! ]”

“[ Father Ye, we’re Coming! ]”

“Countless fans of ye Zao found out through the Miao Yin short video that ye Zao had participated in ‘village’, and they all climbed over the wall.”

“Soon, the first episode of the program ended.”

Cen Yuyan originally wanted to see ye Zao make a fool of himself on the program.

“Unexpectedly, not only did ye Zao not make a fool of himself, but he became popular instead.”

Those who should be popular did not become popular.

Those who should not become popular became popular instead.

What was this?

“After the program aired, “Country”immediately became a hot search.”

# country leaves! #

# catching snake leaves with bare hands! #

# driving tractor leaves! #

# cooking leaves! #

# Sitara YC leaves #

The hot topics on Weibo were almost contracted by ye Zao.

“In just two hours, ye Zao had gained more than five million fans on Miao Yin platform.”

On the other side.

“Song Chenyu did not watch “Country”because she knew that after the program ended, she would definitely become a hot topic.”

“After all, her traffic was there.”

Ye Zao must have been completely discredited by now.

“Song Chenyu curled her lips and opened Weibo. The moment she saw the hot searches list on Weibo, song Chenyu thought that she was seeing things.”

The top five hot searches on Weibo were not for her.

It was fine if it was not for her.

“Instead, it made ye Zao on the hot searches.”

The hot searches were all about ye Zao’s photos.

“There were more than 10,000 comments and reposts under each keyword.”

The first hot topic was labeled as ‘explosive’.

Not only that.

Song Chenyu also found that there were many negative comments about her on the internet.

Some people said that she was a fraud.

Some people said that she was fake.

There were even people who said that she could not be compared to ye Zao!

She could not be compared to ye Zao?

Song Chenyu was so angry that she even dropped her phone.

“She originally thought that ye Zao would definitely become the target of ridicule when he appeared on the show this time. She did not expect that not only was ye Zao not ridiculed by the entire Internet, but he had also become very popular!”

No.

She could not let such a thing happen.

Song Chenyu narrowed his eyes.

“Cen Yuyan knew that song Chenyu definitely did not feel good, so she drove over to song Chenyu’s side and comforted him. “Chenyu, don’t take those words on the Internet to heart.””

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “Actually, what the Internet said is right. I really can’t compare to miss ye.””

“”Who said that you can’t compare to Ye Zhuo!”Cen Yuyan frowned and said, “I think there’s something shady going on with the program that you guys participated in!”! “Other than being able to drive a tractor, the food that the snake and ye Zhuo cooked were all props arranged by the program team, right?””

“No.”Song Chenyu shook her head. “I personally prepared the food for our Blue Team. Miss ye must have also personally prepared the food for the Red Team.”

“”That might not be the case.”Cen Yuyan stood up and said, “There’s definitely something fishy going on inside!””

“Otherwise, could someone like ye Zhuo catch a snake with his bare hands?”

Could he cook?

“Song Chenyu continued, “Yuyan, if there’s no evidence, you can’t just speak nonsense. It’s getting late. You should go back and rest! I’m really fine.”” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Cen Yuyan said, “I’ll stay here to accompany you tonight.””

“Song Chenyu mocked, “You dare to tell me that no one is waiting for you downstairs?”Although song Chenyu had been participating in the program for the past few days, she had spoken on the phone with Zhou Rui.”

Zhou Rui’s plan had been completed smoothly.

“Just yesterday, CEN Yuyan had already confessed her love to Zhou Rui.”

“Cen Yuyan felt a little embarrassed when Song Chenyu hit the nail on the head. “Chenyu, what nonsense are you spouting!””

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “You’re embarrassed with me?””

“Cen Yuyan raised her head and looked at song Chenyu. “Chenyu, how did you know about this?””

“”I can see it in your eyes,”song Chenyu continued, “Yuyan, you’re my best friend. I can tell what you’re thinking at a glance. That boy must be very good, right? I can see happiness in your eyes.””
