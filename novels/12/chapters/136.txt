Who would have thought that he was here for big head.

He opened his mouth and asked for 50 million.

And he asked for it so matter-of-factly.

Using the word ‘shameless’to describe them was simply an insult to the word ‘shameless’.

“What’s 50 million? We have 100 million in our hands,”ye Zao replied calmly.

100 million?

Lin Xiaowei looked at ye Zao in shock.

“You, are you serious?”

Not only was Lin Xiaowei stunned, even ye Dafu, Yao Cuifen, and Ye Shuai were shocked.

100 million!

What kind of concept was that?

In other words, their family was about to become a billionaire.

Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Of course it’s true. Otherwise, where would we get the money to buy a shop? Not only will we buy a shop, we will be ready to buy a big villa soon!”

It was not boasting to say that he had 100 million yuan!

Moreover, this 100 million yuan did not include the restaurant’s income. It was all earned from ye Zhuo’s missions on the technology website, as well as the live broadcast and clothes that could adjust the temperature.

The restaurant’s income was all saved by Ye Shu. After all, the restaurant was also managed.

When she heard that ye Shu had 100 million yuan in her hands, Lin Xiaowei was so jealous that her heart was filled with jealousy.

But when she thought about how the money would soon be hers,.

Lin Xiaowei felt a lot better, then she said, “Isn’t it nice for the two of you to live here? Live in a villa! Hurry up and go to the bank and transfer the 100 million yuan to our account! This much money should be placed in our account for safekeeping. You’re both orphans and widowed. What if you’re cheated by someone?”

They should be the ones buying the Big Villa!

Ye Zhuo and ye Shu were not qualified to live in a big villa.

Lin Xiaowei only wanted to ask ye Shu for 50 million yuan.

She did not expect ye Shu to have 100 million yuan in her hands!

What a surprise!

100 million yuan. Not only could she buy a few big villas, she could also buy a big villa for her family!

Let Her family live a good life too.

“Go, go, Go! Leave Now! Quickly go to the bank and transfer the money to my and your uncle’s accounts!”Lin Xiaowei continued, “Oh right, Zhuozhuo, I heard that you are a live streamer and your income is very high now. Why do you need so much money as a child? Hurry up and change your salary card into my card. From now on, I will give you 1,000 yuan every month to spend!”

1,000 yuan was not a small amount!

How could a little girl like ye Zhuo spend so much money?

As for the other money, Lin Xiaowei had to keep it for her son and daughter.

With this money, she could send her children to study abroad.

Ye Zhuo tilted his head and looked out of the window. He smiled and said, “It’s not even dark yet, and you’re already dreaming! Let me tell you, don’t even think about getting a single cent of my money!”

“What do you mean by your money!”Yao Cuifen jumped out and said, “This money is all mine! Even you have the blood of our old ye family! You Shameless Bastard!”

Lin Xiaowei took advantage of the situation and sat down on the sofa, “Mom is right. Not only is the money ours, even you are our old ye family’s! “If you don’t give it to us, we won’t leave. Buy a few locks and lock up those few shops tomorrow. I want to see who can outlast the other!”

Ye Shu was not married.

Ye Zhuo’s surname was ye.

They wanted to leave the ye family?

Difficult!

They were born in the Ye family and died in the Ye family’s ghost!

Even if they brought this to the police station, it could only be considered a family dispute.

Ye Shu took a deep breath. She knew that if she did not give them the money, this matter would not be over.

No matter what, they were connected by blood. No one could solve the problem brought about by this kind of original family.

“I don’t have fifty million. How much do you want?”

Ye Zhuo frowned slightly.

She understood ye Shu’s psychology.

But for people like the Ye family’s parents, they couldn’t compromise at all.

Not a single cent could be given!

Because once they started, there would be endless trouble in the future.

It seemed that.

They had to think of a way to make ye Shu stand up.

Ye Zhuo’s gaze fell on Yao Cuifen, and he had a plan in his heart.

“You can’t give them money! Mom! You Can’t give them a single cent!”Ye Zhuo shouted.

“Little B * Tch! Shut Up!”Yao Cuifen immediately jumped up and scolded ye Zhuo.

“Old pious woman! Shut Up!”

For so many years, it had always been Yao Cuifen who scolded others. She could scold whoever she wanted, but no one had ever dared to scold her!

Yao Cuifen immediately jumped up. “Little B * Tch! Bastard! You uneducated bastard! Why Don’t You Go Die...”

After saying that, she pushed ye Zao fiercely.

This time, ye Zao did not Dodge or fight back. He was prepared to be pushed by Yao Cuifen and hit against the wall.
