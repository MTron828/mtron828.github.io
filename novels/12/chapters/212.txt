“”Since it’s not your cat, Let’s Go!”The two of them turned around and continued walking. ”

“Meow!”Brother Meow immediately followed Lin Ze.

“”Brother Ze, is it really not your cat?”Li Wen asked suspiciously. ”

“No.”

“Li Wen scratched his head and said with a troubled expression, “But it has been following us.” ”

“Lin Ze turned to look at brother Meow. “Don’t follow me anymore! Even if you follow me, I Won’t take you!” ”

“Meow Meow!”

Brother Meow didn’t give up and continued to follow Lin ze.

Until the two of them got on the car.

Brother Meow was still following them.

Lin Ze hardened his heart and closed the car door. Brother Meow was locked outside.

The sound of a bicycle engine could be heard. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Lin Ze leaned against the back of the chair.

“F * ck! F * ck! That cat is almost flying!”Li Wen said in surprise.

Lin Ze turned around and looked.

He saw brother Meow running as fast as he could.

“Stop the car!”Lin Ze suddenly said.

The driver hurriedly stopped the car.

Lin Ze opened the car door and walked out.

“In a moment, when Lin Ze got into the car again, there was a dirty cat in his arms. ”

“Li Wen asked curiously, “Brother Ze, you want to keep it?” ”

Lin Ze’s face was still expressionless. “I won’t keep such an ugly cat. I just want to throw it away somewhere else! So it won’t follow me all the time!”

“OH.”Li Wen nodded.

“Not long after, the car stopped in front of the Li family’s villa. ”

“Lin Ze was a frequent visitor to the Li family, so he was familiar with the Li family. He carried brother Meow and went upstairs with Li Wen. ”

“When dog two and fat tiger saw the two of them, they asked curiously, “Brother Ze, Mozzie, why are you here so quickly?” ”

“Li Wen said, “I happened to see brother Ze on the way.” ”

“Fat Tiger saw the cat in Lin Ze’s arms and asked curiously, “Brother Ze, when did you get a cat?” ”

“Lin Ze did not answer fat tiger directly. He threw the cat onto the balcony and warned, “Don’t run around! Otherwise, I’ll stew you for cat soup tonight!” ”

“Meow!”

Lin Ze closed the balcony door and turned to look at dog two and fat tiger. “That’s not my cat. That’s the Cat I want to throw away.”

“”Brother Ze! You want to throw away such a cute cat! If you don’t want it, you can give it to me!”Fat Tiger said excitedly. ”

Lin Ze walked over. “This cat is too ugly. It’s best to throw it away.”

“Only when Lin Ze walked over did fat tiger see the injury on his face. He couldn’t care less about the cat. “D * MN! Brother Ze, what happened to your face?” ”

“Hearing this, dog two, who was feeding the fish, hurriedly ran over. ”

“What happened to brother Ze?”

This was the first time they had seen Lin ze injured after knowing each other for so long.

And it was on his face.

It was very obvious.

He had been beaten up.

“”Brother Ze, did someone bully you? Tell me, I’ll help you take care of him!”Fat Tiger rolled up his sleeves and said angrily. ”

“And me!”Buttface picked up the nunchucks beside him!

“Lin Ze smiled and said, “No one bullied me. My grandmother beat me up.”His tone was so indifferent that it was as if he was talking about what he had eaten this morning. ”

“Ah?”Fat Tiger and buttface were surprised.

Old Mrs. Lin hit him?

What was going on?

They were best friends.

Lin Ze did not hide anything.

He told the three of them everything.

“Hearing this, the three of them were furious! ”

“Your grandmother is really too much!”

“Is she old and muddled? She even hit her own grandson so hard!”

“”Brother Ze, didn’t you explain yourself?” ”

Lin Ze smiled and didn’t say anything.

Because Old Mrs. Lin never gave him a chance to explain himself.’

“At this moment, Li Wen’s mother, Chu Su, brought over a bottle of safflower oil. “AH ze, this safflower oil is very effective in reducing swelling. Try It.” ”

“”Thank you, Auntie.”Lin Ze took the safflower oil from Chu Su’s hands with both hands. ”

“Chu Su sighed. Lin Ze usually looked very obedient and sensible, and his grades were very good. She did not know how old Mrs. Lin did it. ”

This motherless child did not have anyone to protect him.

How Pitiful!

“”You’re welcome.”Chu Su continued, “At Aunty’s place, it’s just like your own home. You can eat and drink whatever you want. Just tell Aunty.” ”

Lin Ze’s eyes suddenly turned red.

His nose also felt a little sore.

“When Old Mrs. Lin slapped him, he did not cry. ”

“When Old Mrs. Lin wanted to chase him out of the house, he did not cry either. But now, he could not help it. ”

“Looking at Chu Su, he thought of his mother. ”
