“Okay.”Lin Ze nodded.

“Lin Ze’s photography skills were not bad, comparable to a first-class photographer. ”

“The Shi Qingcheng on camera was much more beautiful than usual. It was as if the empress of the Qing dynasty, Wulanara, had really walked out of the deep palace walls. ”

“By the time ye Han finished eating his dessert, Lin Ze’s international blockbuster had already been completed. ”

“Lin Ze continued, “Are you guys still going to climb the Great Wall?” ”

“The Great Wall? I want to Go!”Shi Qingcheng said excitedly.

Ye Han nodded. “Then let’s Go! Is there still time?”

“Lin Ze looked at his watch. “It’s Alright, we can make it in time.” ”

Over here.

“Bai Jingshu finished her tea, packed her things, and was about to pay the bill when she realized that the bill had already been settled. ”

“”May I ask who settled the bill for me?”Bai Jingshu looked around, but she didn’t find any acquaintances. ”

“She had been on Earth for so long, but she hadn’t made any friends. ”

The cashier shook his head. “It was a tall and thin gentleman who settled the bill for you.”

“Sir?”Bai Jingshu asked.

“Yes.”

Bai Jingshu frowned slightly. Who Was It?

“Bai Jingshu took out eight RMB bills from her wallet and said, “If you can see that Sir Again, please help me return the money to him. Then, tell him thank you on my behalf.” ”

“What if you can’t See It?”The cashier asked.

“Bai Jingshu said, “If you can’t see it, I’ll come again next time.” ”

Bai Jingshu had real estate in the capital.

“However, because the coins in the s galaxy were not common to Earth and the real estate prices in the capital city were too high, her house was not too big. ”

The cashier nodded and took out a pen and paper. “Please leave your contact information.”

“Okay.”Bai Jingshu left her name and contact information.

Bai Jingshu left the money and was about to leave when she received a message from the chief editor asking her to meet her at a coffee shop not far away.

“Bai Jingshu replied: [ alright, I’ll be there soon. ] ” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“When she arrived at the coffee shop, she saw that the editor-in-chief was already waiting for her. ”

“When she saw Bai Jingshu, the editor-in-chief immediately waved at her. “Present day! Present day, over here!” ”

She even thought that present day was Bai Jingshu’s pen name.

That’s right.

Bai Jingshu was a historical novel author.

“Her published novels, such as “Records of the Great Song dynasty”and “Before the Qing dynasty”, had already reached a million sales. ”

This was also the reason why Bai Jingshu was able to buy a house in the capital.

“Lu Lu.”Bai Jingshu walked over and sat down.

“The chief editor, Little Lu, was a 30-year-old woman who had yet to settle down. Although she was already 30 years old, her face still retained the youthful vibrancy of a young girl and her face was full of collagen. ”

“Little Lu said excitedly, “Today, did you know? Your copy of the Great Tang of the prosperous times has been sold out in advance! The publishing house is preparing to print another 100,000 copies. Go back and prepare more autographs.” ”

“Bai Jingshu was stunned. She did not expect that the prosperous era’s great Tang would have such good sales. She smiled and said, “Okay, how many do you need?” ”

“”About 10,000 copies.” ”

Bai Jingshu nodded. “Okay.”

“Young deer hugged Bai Jingshu excitedly. “My dear, I love you so much! Give me a kiss, Kiss!” ”

Young deer was 23 years old and worked in the editing industry. He had been an editor since he was young and had met many authors along the way.

“However, it was the first time he had met an author who was so dedicated to her work and did not have a temper. ”

“Bai Jingshu was also a god-level figure in the industry, but she did not put on any airs and was very cooperative with the editing work. ”

She never delayed the manuscript and even completed the mailing on time by signing it in person.

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “I should be the one thanking you. Actually, you could have just told me over the phone about such a small matter. There was no need for you to come all the way here.” ”

“”There’s one more thing,”young deer said. ”

“What is it?”Bai Jingshu asked.

“Young deer continued, “When are you going to release your new book?” ”

“Bai Jingshu shook her head. “I’m not ready for the time being. Next, I plan to take a walk around.” ”

“”Mm, you should really take a good rest.”Young deer continued, “Then, are you coming to the annual party this year?” ”

“Ever since Bai Jingshu started writing, she had never attended the annual party. ”

Many people were curious to see what she looked like today.

“Because she did not introduce herself and did not open a social media app, the fans did not even know Bai Jingshu’s gender. ”

“I’m not too sure either.”Bai Jingshu shook her head. “We’ll see.”

“Alright then.”Young deer nodded. “I’ll contact you when the time comes!”

“OK.”

“Deer seemed to remember something and said, “By the way, the big boss of this year’s annual party will also come!” ”
