“Zhao Liu noticed Liu Jing’s expression and walked over. He smiled and said, “Jingjing, don’t mind him. My father is that kind of person.” ”

Liu Jing nodded. “Okay.”

“Zhao Liu liked this petite wife very much. He was very worried that Liu Jing would be upset, he then said, “My father is already so old. He might not be able to do it one day. When that time comes, the entire Zhao family will be ours. Don’t mind the gaze of a person who is about to die.” ”

“Liu Jing looked at the man beside her who was even older than her father. There was an indescribable expression in her eyes. “Ah Liu, thank you.” ”

“Everyone said that she was interested in the Zhao family’s wealth, but that was not the case. ”

“She was pretty and there were many people who came to offer her an olive branch. Among them, there was no lack of young and powerful people. ”

“However, he chose Zhao Liu resolutely. ”

There was no other reason.

It was because Zhao Liu gave her the feeling of a father.

It was not until she married into the Zhao family that she found out about Zhao Liu’s romantic affairs.

“We are husband and wife.”Zhao Liu put his arm around Liu Jing’s shoulder.

“Liu Jing continued, “I heard that your son is coming back?” ”

Liu Jing was now an outsider in the Zhao family.

She did not know anything.

She even needed to look at the eyes of a servant. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“After knowing that Zhao Liu’s son was coming back, she became even more anxious. ”

What if Zhao Liu’s son did not acknowledge her?

“”Yes.”Zhao Liu nodded and continued, “That child has a good temper. He will definitely not make things difficult for you.” ”

“Zhao Siliang was two years older than Liu Jing. At the moment, Zhao Siliang did not know that there was a step-mother younger than him in the family. ”

“However, Zhao Liu was certain that Zhao Siliang would definitely not make things difficult for Liu Jing. ”

Liu Jing nodded.

“Zhao Liu supported Liu Jing as they walked into the house. Liu Jing looked at Zhao Liu and asked hesitantly, “Did I, did I cause trouble for the Family?” ”

“”No, what trouble can you cause!”Zhao Liu smiled and said, “We have always been estranged from the Chen family. Even without you, our conflict is unavoidable.” ”

“After saying that, Zhao Liu continued to comfort her, “Jingjing, don’t think too much. That’s not a problem that you should be worried about.” ”

Liu Jing nodded and did not say anything else.

Zhao Liu would never know the uneasiness in her heart.

On the other side.

Old Master Chen took a special plane back to cloud capital.

“The first thing he did when he returned was to look for connections everywhere. No matter what, he could not let Chen Youlong really go to jail. ”

“The Chen family had run amok in the cloud capital for so many years and had accumulated a lot of connections. Normally, as long as Old Master Chen coughed, a group of people would surround him. ”

But this time...

The people who used to flatter old master Chen seemed to have disappeared in an instant!

“Since they didn’t come, Old Master Chen could only take the initiative to look for them. However, those people all avoided him as if old master Chen was some kind of terrifying virus. ”

What should he do now?

Old Master Chen sat in his wheelchair and frowned.

“The butler continued, “Old Master, I think this is somewhat similar to third master song’s methods.” ”

“Shiyu?”Old Master Chen asked.

The butler nodded.

“In Yun Jing, other than song Shiyu, no one else had such methods. ”

“Old Master Chen’s furrowed brows did not ease up. He continued, “Why would he do that!” ”

The Butler did not say anything.

Old Master Chen sighed. “Call him!”

“Okay.”The butler nodded.

“As soon as he finished speaking, the Butler connected to Song Shiyu’s phone. ”

“A few seconds later, a busy voice came from the other end. ”

Song Shiyu had blocked old master Chen’s number.

“Realizing this problem, the Butler’s heart skipped a beat. ”

“Old Master...”the butler turned to look at Old Master Chen.

“Old Master Chen continued, “Contact Yaoyao and see what’s going on with her.” ”

The housekeeper continued to contact Chen Siyao.

“Chen Siyao’s call was quickly connected, but there were no new developments on her end. ”

It was unknown if song Shiyu knew about her current situation.

“After learning about Chen Siyao’s situation, Old Master Chen was in a terrible state. ”

Song Shiyu couldn’t possibly be that heartless!

“The housekeeper saw through old master Chen’s thoughts and comforted him. “Old Master, don’t worry. What if third master has something urgent and doesn’t know about eldest miss?” ”

“At this point, the housekeeper paused and said, “Third master is definitely not the kind of person who is cold and heartless.” ”

“I hope so.”Old Master Chen sighed softly.

“After saying that, old master Chen continued, “Let’s go to the police station now.” ”

“Okay.”The butler nodded and began to arrange the vehicles.
