“Okay.”Song Shiyu nodded slightly.

Butler song bent down and turned to walk out.

“Song Shiyu said at this time, “You guys choose first.” ”

“”Mr. Song is also omnipotent, just like burning?”Li Yueyue’s voice came through the earpiece. ”

“”Yes,”song Shiyu answered. ”

“Li Yueyue continued, “Mr. Song, I heard burning say that you’re still single?” ”

“Yes.”

“Hearing that, Li Yueyue said excitedly, “Then let me introduce you! I know a lot of beautiful girls! and two of them are in Chinese Opera!” ”

“Li Yueyue had just formed a couple and felt that being a matchmaker was not bad. Song Shiyu was a very high-quality man. He had money, looks, and a body. She really did not want to waste this good resource. ”

“”Thank you, but I’m not thinking about personal matters for now,”song Shiyu said. ”

“Li Yueyue said very enthusiastically, “Then what kind of person do you like? I’ll help you keep an eye out!” ”

“There aren’t too many rules and regulations. No one can say for sure about fate.”Song Shiyu chose a wild hero. “The important thing is to get along with someone.”

“”That’s true.”Li Yueyue asked again, “Mr. Song, have you not met anyone who got along with someone?” ”

Song Shiyu’s tone was indifferent. “No.”

“D * MN! You’re too scary. Don’t you have puberty?”Who Didn’t have an agitated puberty?

How could song Shiyu not have a girl that he liked?

“After saying that, Li Yueyue seemed to realize something and continued, “Mr. Song, I Talk a lot. I might be a little different from Great Scorch. Don’t Mind Me!” ”

“Okay.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“”Mr. Song, how long have you known Great Scorch?”Li Yueyue continued to ask. ”

“An answer immediately appeared in song Shiyu’s heart, but the words that came out of his mouth were, “It should be two to three years ago!” ”

“When they first met, he was twelve. ”

She was six.

“In the blink of an eye, so many years had passed. ”

“”Oh,”Li Yueyue smiled and said, “Mr. Song, do you usually talk very little in life?” ”

“Yes.”

“”Then I’ll try to talk less,”Li Yueyue said. ”

“Song Shiyu said, “It’s okay. You can do whatever you want.” ”

“”Mr. Song, I think your answer is wrong,”Li Yueyue said. ”

“What’s Wrong?”Song Shiyu asked.

“Li Yueyue said, “You should ask me if I have a boyfriend.” ”

“Do you have one?”Song Shiyu asked.

“”No,”Li Yueyue continued, “So Mr. Song, you must help me keep an eye out for him. After all, birds of a feather flock together. Mr. Song, since you are so outstanding, the people around you must be very outstanding too! “I like boys who are a little more sunny. If it’s their age, it’s best if they are not older than me by more than three years. If they are younger than me, that would be even better! “I like the type of boy who is a little puppy! “Oh, right, height is also very important. I’m 1.62 meters tall. He definitely can’t be less than 1.82 meters!” ”

Li Yueyue’s ideal type was a big boy who was sunny and handsome.

It would be best if he was a little younger than her.

“Okay.”Song Shiyu’s voice was emotionless. “I’ll keep an eye out for you.”

“”Thank you, Mr. Song.”Li Yueyue continued, “They all say that third master song has a bad temper and is unpredictable. I was afraid of you before! Actually, they don’t understand you at all!” ”

“In the beginning, Li Yueyue was indeed a little afraid of Song Shiyu, until the two of them played a lot of games together. ”

“As long as song Shiyu was online, whether it was an Lizi, Zhao pingting, or Li Yueyue, as long as someone invited him, he would definitely accept to form a team. ”

Song Shiyu did not say anything and used a big move with a backhand.

Four kills!

“Li Yueyue said in surprise, “D * mn! Awesome! Awesome!” ”

“After the two of them played a few rounds, Li Yueyue continued, “I’m sorry, Mr. Song. I suddenly have something to do, so I’ll be leaving first.” ”

“Okay.”

“Remember to keep an eye out for quality boys for me!”Li Yueyue did not forget to remind him.

“Okay.”

“Goodbye.”

“After saying this, Li Yueyue left. ”

Song Shiyu looked at his friends list and clicked on a familiar profile picture frame. He entered the main page and then clicked on intimate relationships.

She had established a total of five intimate relationships.

The first one was a couple.

The rest were all best friends.

“Song Shiyu’s lips curved. She didn’t expect Cen Wuye to play games with his girlfriend, and even establish a relationship. ”

“In a moment, Song Shiyu exited her homepage and cleaned up the traces. ”

“After doing all this, song Shiyu logged into wechat again, opened her personal profile, and entered her circle of friends. ”
