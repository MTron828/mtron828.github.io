“Chapter 1343: 278: Zhou Xiang then got tough and angrily rebuked Xie wanqiu, cutting off the relationship! 1”

Translator: 549690339

“So, if Father Zhou wasn’t an idiot, then what was? ”

“Father Zhou himself was an idiot, and the daughter he gave birth to was also an idiot! ”

Disgusting Idiot.

“Xie wanqiu had been married to the Zhou family for more than 30 years, so she wasn’t very good to a pair of siblings in the Zhou family. In order to establish the rules, when the two siblings were 15 or 16 years old, she even whipped them, but Zhou Xiang still had to call her mother! ”

However.

“Zhou Xiang’s younger brother, Zhou Jinbei, was not quite the same as Zhou Xiang. He left his hometown when he was a minor and went out to work. ”

“After he went out, Zhou Jinbei lost contact with his family. ”

“From then on, there was no news of him. ”

It was not until 10 years later that Father Zhou sent someone to find him.

At that time.

“Zhou Jinbei was already a famous local rich businessman, and he was already married and had children. ”

“Over the years, although Zhou Jinbei kept in touch with his father, their relationship was not as close as that of an ordinary family. ”

“After all, there was a gap. ”

“Her father was coaxed by her to the point where he could not differentiate north from south, east, west, and north. Every year, he would ask Zhou Jinbei for a high maintenance fee. ”

“If Zhou Jinbei did not give it to him, his father would go to the television station and the local newspaper to make the matter of Zhou Jinbei not supporting the elderly known to everyone. ”

“Zhou Jinbei had once moved the top five people in China. If a scandal were to break out, it would have a serious impact on him. ”

“Helpless, Zhou Jinbei had no choice but to admit defeat. ”

“The money that Zhou Jinbei had asked for had all been handed over to Xie wanqiu to keep. Xie wanqiu, on the other hand, had given most of the money to her lover, Wu Youyu. ”

“All these years, year after year, day after day, not to mention doubting, Zhou Jinbei’s father did not even ask a single question. ”

“Thinking of this, Xie Wanqiu let out a sigh of relief. ”

An idiot.

“He was afraid that if Wu Youyu ran to his side and called him brother, he would not think of anything. ”

“However, Xie Wanqiu had always been a cautious person. She raised her head and looked at Wu Youyu. “Although that’s what you said, it’s better to be careful than to be careless.”She had been with Wu Youyu for so many years, and she could not let things slip at a critical moment, she couldn’t let others catch her. ”

“Father Zhou might be a little stupid, but if he knew about the matter between her and Wu Youyu, he would definitely not let it go. ”

“No man could tolerate his wife being cuckolded. Moreover, she had been cuckolded for so many years. ”

“”Don’t worry, this is Beijing!”Wu youyu smiled and said, “When I came, Zhou Zuolong was walking the dog and fighting crickets!” ”

Xie wanqiu nodded. “When did you get here?”

“”Just now,”wu youyu continued, “I came to the hospital as soon as I got off the plane. I wanted to give you a surprise.” ”

Xie Wanqiu was full of smiles.

“Although she had been with Wu Youyu for more than thirty years, she had never felt bored. No matter which time they met, they were like a couple who had just been together. ”

This was true love.

“In Xie Wanqiu’s eyes, Wu Youyu was the real man. ”

Unlike that Useless Zhou Zuolong!

“He had no manliness at all. He was only in his seventies, but he was completely done for. ”

“Wu Youyu held Xie Wanqiu’s hand and continued, “WANQIU, how is that matter?” ”

The matter he was referring to was naturally the matter between Zheng Wanyin and Cen Shaoqing.

That’s right.

Zheng Wanyin was Wu Youyu’s biological granddaughter.

Zheng Wanyin’s mother was Wu Youyu and Xie Wanqiu’s biological daughter.

“When Xie Wanqiu and Wu Youyu were secretly dating, Xie Wanqiu’s ex-husband was still alive. ”

“Moreover, Wu Youyu and Xie Wanqiu’s ex-husband were good brothers. ”

“Before this, Wu Youyu had always called Xie wanqiu sister-in-law. ”

And Wu Youyu was indeed three years younger than Xie wanqiu.

No one would have thought that these two people would get together.

“As long as Zheng Wanyin could marry Cen Shaoqing, then he would be Cen Shaoqing’s grandfather in the future! ”

“The Cen family’s master, the old great-grandfather. ”

Although Wu Youyu was not familiar with the CEN family.

“But through Xie wanqiu, he could be said to know the Cen family’s situation like the back of his hand. ”

“The Cen family was currently under the control of the Cen Old Lady, Bai Tang. ”

“Bai Tang was already very old. This year, she was already in her eighties and was almost ninety years old. How many more years could she live as an old woman? ”

“Zhou Xiang was also a spineless person. He was tightly controlled by Xie wanqiu. Not to mention resisting, he did not even dare to speak harshly to Xie wanqiu. ”

He was no different from a tool. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“It could be said that as long as the Cen Old Lady died, the Cen family would belong to them. ”

“Thinking of this, Wu Youyu felt extremely happy. ”

That was the CEN family!

“They were the number one family in Huaxia. From now on, even fifth master Cen had to bow and greet him as Grandpa. ”

“Xie wanqiu said, “Although there isn’t much progress yet, don’t worry. Everything is under my control. As long as I’m here, I can let yinyin marry into the Cen Family!”Her yinyin was born with a phoenix life, she should marry into the Cen family. How could ordinary people be worthy of Zheng Wanyin? ”
