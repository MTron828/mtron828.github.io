“Hearing this, Xiao Baibai said excitedly, “Good duck, good duck! I knew Grandma Loves Me the most!” ”

Granny Cen patted Xiao Baibai’s head. “Quickly go back and charge it! Your Battery is about to run out.”

“”Yes, yes!”Xiao Baibai nodded. “Grandma, I’ll go and charge it then!” ”

Old Mrs. Cen watched little white leave.

“When Little White’s figure could not be seen, old Mrs. Cen stood up and went to the bathroom. ”

Cen Shaoqing came to the main banquet hall.

“He was wearing a plain white long gown with knotted buttons. As he walked in the crowd of all sorts of people, he looked exceptionally eye-catching. His demeanor was extremely noble. ”

“Leader.”Cen Shaoqing walked to ye Zao’s side and took out a lipstick to pass to Ye Zao. “Here.”

Ye Zao was stunned. “Why are you giving this to me?”

“She seldom wore makeup. Other than very formal occasions, she did not wear makeup most of the time. ”

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “I bought a white shirt.” ”

“White shirt?”Ye Zao still could not react in time. What did a white shirt have to do with lipstick?

Cen Shaoqing took out his phone slowly and took out a screenshot of his chat history to give to Ye Zao.

“Song Ziyi: Brother Five, I’ve found a girlfriend. ”

Cen Shaoqing: Congratulations.

“In the photo, there was a selfie of a man wearing a white shirt, but it did not capture his face. It was only below the collarbone. ”

Next was the voice chat history.

Ye Zhuo was a little confused. “What did you want me to see?”

Wasn’t this a very normal recording of the conversation?

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Look at the right collarbone of his white shirt.” ” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Ye Zhuo narrowed his eyes and looked at it carefully.

“A moment later, he finally realized that something was wrong. “There’s a stamp here, right? Do you want to buy the same shirt?” ”

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “That’s a lip print. It’s his girlfriend’s.” ”

“As he finished speaking, Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted slightly. “I want to have it too.” ”

“”Alright, I’ll satisfy you.”Ye Zhuo took the lipstick and continued, “I bought you a suit the last time I went shopping. I didn’t get the chance to give it to you before. Do you want to change it now?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing’s lips curled up slightly. “Since you want me to change it so badly, I’ll reluctantly change it.” ”

“Follow me.”

Cen Shaoqing immediately followed ye Zhuo’s footsteps.

“Soon, they reached the bedroom. ”

Ye Zhuo opened the door of the changing room and took out a suit from the wardrobe.

“This was a high-end model from HK brand. When Ye Zhuo first saw it, he thought it was Cen Shaoqing, so he bought it back. ”

“You change inside. I’ll wait for you in the room.”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Ye Zhuo walked out and closed the door of the changing room. Soon, CEN Shaoqing was the only one left in the changing room. ”

Cen Shaoqing picked up his clothes and slowly changed.

Ye Zhuo sat on the sofa and played with his phone.

“About five minutes later, the door of the changing room was opened. ”

Ye Zhuo looked up.

“When he saw this, he was slightly stunned. ”

“Perhaps he was used to seeing this person in plain clothes and long clothes, but now that Cen Shaoqing had changed into a suit, he gave people an amazing feeling. ”

His figure proportions were very good.

“He was 1.93 meters tall, and his long and slender legs were wrapped in black suit pants, making him look extremely abstinent. Looking up from this leg, one would see a well-tailored handmade white shirt. White was a very otherworldly color, it was very difficult for someone to control white so well, but he did it. ”

“If Cen Shaoqing was a refined and noble noble young master from the Republic of China before, then the current Cen Shaoqing was the abstinent and cold overbearing CEO! ”

He was practically the boss.

“Cen Shaoqing rarely wore a suit and was not used to it. “Leader, how is it?” ”

“”Very good.”Ye Zhuo continued, “I’ll take a photo for you.” ”

“Stamp it first.”Cen Shaoqing’s tone was slow.

Stamp it?

Ye Zhuo was stunned for a moment before he reacted. He picked up the lipstick and the mirror and carefully applied the lipstick.

It was a very pure retro red.

“This kind of red was very picky. If the skin was a little darker, it would be dimmed by the red. ”

“However, ye Zao’s skin was whiter than snow. His eyebrows and eyes were like paintings, and he could not compare with the gorgeous red. ”

This gorgeous red seemed to be born for her.

“After putting on the lipstick, Ye Zao admired himself in the mirror. He could not help but sigh, “Why do I Look So Good!” ”

“Are you done?”Cen Shaoqing walked over and asked.

“Yes.”Ye Zao put the small mirror back into his pocket.

The mirror was ye Zao’s daily necessities. She had to carry it with her at all times so that she could admire her beauty at any time.
