“Baron’s face was dark, and he didn’t say anything. ”

“If this had happened in C country, it wouldn’t have mattered. ”

“After all, the current C country wasn’t the C country of five years ago. ”

But this was China.

A country that was inferior to C country in everything.

When did China’s hacking technology become so powerful?

Or could it be that. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

The other party was like him...

A foreigner?

“If the other party was not a foreigner, there was no way to explain all of this. ”

So.

The other party was definitely a foreigner.

“Baron narrowed his eyes and looked up at the waiter. “Bring the tools over, I’ll clean it up myself.”Even if the hacker’s things were scrapped, they could not be picked up by others. ”

Especially someone like him who was always on the bounty list.

“Okay.”The waiter nodded.

“After cleaning up the scene, Baron left the coffee shop. When he returned home, he continued to hack into the world’s database. ”

However.

The results were not satisfactory.

Baron was more and more certain that the person behind this was definitely a foreigner.

How could a Chinese person have such a brain?

“However, even if the other party was a foreigner, he would definitely be able to defeat him! ”

Baron locked himself in his room and focused on cracking the firewall.

On the other side.

“Ye Zao was playing games while occasionally looking at his computer. With one hand, he quickly operated the game controller while the other hand clicked the mouse. ”

“Compared to Baron, who was scratching his ears and cheeks, ye Zao was extremely calm. ”

“At the end of the game, ye Zao could not be bothered to play with him anymore. He wrote a step and put it on the web page. As long as the progress bar reached 99% , it would automatically attack. ”

Baron locked himself in his room for three days and three nights.

“In these three days, other than drinking a few glasses of water, he had not eaten a single grain of rice. Standing in front of the mirror again, Baron had lost a lot of weight. His eyes were deeply sunken and his beard was unkempt. In an instant, he turned from a young man in his twenties.., to be a dirty old man. ”

Too bad.

“He still could not break the other side’s firewall, not only failed to break, these three days, the other side is like playing cat and mouse with him, first give him a little hope, and then turn around to attack him! ”

Baron scratched his head in anger.

He didn’t think they had the energy to fight him.

I Can’t believe they spent three days and three nights with him.

Who!

Who was the other party?

“Other than Z, he had never met such a formidable opponent. ”

Could it be that the other party was Z?

“However, would an expert like Z stay in a media company to develop? ”

Definitely Not!

“If Baron knew that the person who was going to deal with him was a human, but a script, Baron would probably choke himself to death with a mouthful of blood. ”

“Comparing people, it was infuriating! ”

Cao Wei waited for three days.

“But it had already been three days, and there was still no news from Baron. This made Cao Wei a little anxious. ”

“Had Baron not found the information yet, or had Baron forgotten to inform him after he found the information? ”

“After thinking about it for a while, Cao Wei picked up his phone and called Baron. “Hello, Mr. Baron, have you found the information on that streamer?” ”

“Baron said with difficulty, “No.” ”

This matter was a disgrace to him.

“After all, he had never failed before. ”

Cao Wei was stunned.

“He did not expect that in the past three days, Baron had not found out anything about YC’s Ye. ”

Who Was Baron?

“He was a famous international hacker, one of the top ten hackers on the hacker rankings. ”

There was actually information that Baron could not find.

This was too unbelievable.

“After a long while, Cao Wei said, “Mr. Baron, you... You’re not joking with me, right?” ”

“”I’m not joking with you.”Baron continued, “But don’t worry, I’ll think of another way.” ”

Baron knew many hackers.

There would always be someone who could deal with it.

He did not believe that a small country like China could still make things difficult for the top experts of C Nation!

Cao Wei did not expect that it would be so difficult to find information on an online streamer.

“After hanging up the phone, Cao Wei frowned. It seemed that he had to think of other ways. ”

...

Half a month later.

Aunt Lang sat at the door and looked into the distance with a gloomy expression.

“Mommy! Mommy!”

“Not far away, a little girl with braids was running over quickly. ”

“The little girl was wearing a pink dress, white glass socks, and beautiful sandals. She looked like a little princess who had walked out of a fairy tale. ”

The little girl in front of her overlapped with the child in her memories.

She was back.

Her little half month was back.

“Aunt Lang could not help but stand up, tears rolling down her cheeks. “Little half month...” ”

“Baby slow down! Be careful not to Fall!”
