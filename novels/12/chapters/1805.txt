“After hearing the news, Old Madam Ouyang was a little angry. Her precious granddaughter was the dream lover of countless people, but the he family was blind! ”

“After hearing the news, not only was Ouyang Chen not angry, he was even smiling. “Grandma Cen, sorry to Trouble You!” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen patted Ouyang Chen’s hand. “He Ziteng’s unwillingness is his loss! Xiao Chen, I believe Grandma Cen, you will definitely find a boyfriend who is a hundred times better than him in the future!” ”

“Ouyang Chen had always been an outstanding girl since she was young. Although she was influenced by Western culture and her thoughts were more unrestrained, this was the first time she had taken the initiative to confess her love. ”

What a pity!

She would die before she could succeed!

“However, Ouyang Chen was not discouraged. Love at first sight was really too difficult. He ziteng did not like her now, but it did not mean that he would not like her in the future! ”

It was said that there was a veil between a woman and a man. She still had a chance!

“Ouyang Chen smiled and said, “Grandma Cen, thank you for your encouragement, but it is not the end yet. I don’t believe that he ziteng can still be made of iron! It is so difficult to guide him!” ”

“”Oh right, Grandma Cen, does he have a girlfriend now?”Ouyang Chen followed up with a question. ”

“If he ziteng had a girlfriend, then forget it. She wouldn’t do something like poaching someone else. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen said, “He doesn’t have a girlfriend yet, but he said that he already has someone he likes. I don’t know if it’s true or not!” ”

As long as he doesn’t have a girlfriend!

“As for the person he likes, he must have made it up to reject her. ”

“Hearing this, Ouyang Chen heaved a sigh of relief. He smiled and said, “Okay, I got it. Thank you, Grandma Cen.” ”

“”You’re welcome.”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Then I’ll go back first.” ”

“I’ll have to trouble you to make a Trip!”Old Mrs. Ouyang sent old Mrs. Cen out.

“After sending Old Lady Cen out, old lady ouyang said, “Xiao Chen, what did you mean just now?” ”

“”Grandma, I like he ziteng. I want to marry him!”Ouyang Chen hugged Old Lady Ouyang’s arm tightly. ”

Old Lady Ouyang frowned tightly.

“At this time, Ouyang Chen still said that he wanted to marry he ziteng! ”

“Xiao Chen! It’s not like we can’t get married. Why do you keep staring at that kid from the He family!”

“Ouyang Chen smiled and said, “Grandma, I Just Want to marry Ouyang Chen!”This kind of feeling was very strange, and Ouyang Chen couldn’t put his finger on it. ”

Old Lady Ouyang was a little unhappy. She felt that Ouyang Chen was a girl. It was really inappropriate for her to do this!

“After all, he ziteng had already explicitly rejected her. ”

“”Xiaochen, you...” ”

“Ouyang Chen smiled and said, “Grandma, I know what you want to say, but what I want to say is that I don’t care about anything. Some things are like fish drinking water. I know my own feelings! “I just want to be happy. As for other things, my mouth is on someone else’s body. I can say whatever I want. It has nothing to do with me!” ”

“Seeing Ouyang Chen Like This, Old Lady Ouyang sighed helplessly. ”

“Children and grandchildren have their own blessings. All of this was Ouyang Chen’s own choice. As a grandma, it was not appropriate for her to interfere too much. ”

On the other side.

The Cen family base.

In the office.

“Cen Shaoqing sat in front of his desk, holding a buddha bead in his hand. He looked up at his assistant and asked, “What exactly happened?” ”

“The assistant was a little nervous, he continued, “According to the news from Mars, Miss Ye’s people were attacked by an unidentified flying object, causing two people to go missing. In order to find them, Miss Ye has not slept for nearly five days and nights.” ”

“Hearing this, Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly. ”

“He knew that something must have happened on Mars. Otherwise, ye Zhuo would not be in such a fatigued state. ”

“However, what Cen Shaoqing did not expect was that an alien life form had appeared on Mars. ”

“I understand.”Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddha bead. “You can leave first.”

“Hearing this, the assistant felt relieved and immediately turned to walk out of the door. ”

Cen Shaoqing also stood up slightly and walked towards the spaceship room.

He had to go to Mars immediately to investigate the matter clearly.

On the other side.

“Outer Space, changyue country. ”

“Qiu Di looked at Qiu Changzhen. “Father, can you be at Ease Now?” ”

Qiu Changzhen nodded.

“Previously, he had always been worried about that low-level human. Now, he was finally at ease. ”

Because that was not ye Zao at all!

“If she really was ye Zao, she would have discovered them this time. ”

But that low-level human did not.

“Qiu Di curled her lips slightly. “Father, I’ve already said that no matter how strong ye Zao is, he’s just a human.” ”
