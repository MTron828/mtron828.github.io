Feng Xianxian used the money given by Feng Qianhua to buy a set of gifts worth six figures to attend Zheng Zhilan’s party.

The car had just stopped at the entrance of the Zheng family’s manor when a young and handsome man came to welcome her.

“”Xianxian, you’re here.””

Feng Xianxian elegantly lifted the hem of her dress and smiled elegantly. “Brother Zimo.”

“This person was Zheng Zhilan’s brother, Zheng Zimo.”

“Zheng Zimo was 21 years old this year, two years older than Feng Xianxian.”

“Because Feng Xianxian had risked her life to save Zheng Zhilan half a year ago, and because Feng Xianxian was gentle and kind, she did not talk much and was very likable, Zheng Zimo had always had a good impression of Feng Xianxian.”

“Zheng zimo smiled and said, “Zhilan is currently receiving guests inside. If she knows about you, that girl will definitely be very happy.””

“Feng Xianxian said, “I’m even happier to be able to attend Zhilan’s birthday party.””

“Actually, Feng Xianxian was very clear about Zheng Zimo’s intentions.”

He had fallen for her.

“Otherwise, why would Zheng Zimo be so attentive to her?”

It was a pity. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Compared to the CEN family, the song family was simply too weak.”

“No matter how good Zheng Zimo was to her, it would only be a futile effort.”

“However, Feng Xianxian really liked the feeling of being chased by others.”

“Zheng Zimo was a talented person. Although the song family could not compare to the Cen family, the song family was a well-known family in the capital. There were countless socialites who had fallen in love with Zheng Zimo, and even went so far as to chase after him.”

“Unfortunately, Zheng Zimo did not take a liking to those rouge and common powder.”

“If those people knew that Zheng Zimo liked her, they would probably die of jealousy, right?”

“Thinking of this, the corners of Feng Xianxian’s mouth curled up into a proud smile.”

Many people came to Zheng Zhilan’s birthday party.

“Seeing Feng Xianxian come over, Zheng Zhilan did not have time to deal with the guests in front of her. She immediately ran over to Feng Xianxian. “Xianxian!””

Many people present knew Feng Xianxian.

Nothing else.

It was only because of the Lin family.

“Everyone knew that the old lady of the Lin family liked Feng Qianxian very much. She treated Feng Qianxian as her own granddaughter, and her eyeballs hurt.”

“Although Feng Qianxian’s surname was Feng, in fact, she was the eldest daughter of the Lin family.”

“Among the daughters of the wealthy families present, who would dare to cast a cold glance at the eldest daughter of the neighboring family?”

And Feng Qianxian herself was very willing to use the identity of the eldest daughter of the Lin family to show off and show off her power.

“In Feng Qianxian’s subconscious mind, she had already thought of herself as the eldest daughter of the Lin Family!”

“Other than her, who else had the qualifications to be the eldest daughter of the Lin Family?”

Who was that bastard?

“Xianxian is here! Zhilan and I were just talking about you!”

“”Xianxian, this gown of yours is really beautiful today! Where did you buy it?””

“A beautiful person looks good in anything.”

“”Oh my God, Xianxian, your legs are too long. And I think you’ve lost weight again!””

“”It’s fine if you’re beautiful, but how are we supposed to live?””

Feng Xianxian was flattered by the group of people and felt very comfortable.

At the Lin family residence.

“When Feng Qianhua arrived at the Lin family residence, old madam Feng had just fallen asleep.”

Auntie Zhang took the health soup from Feng Qianhua’s hands. “Why didn’t Xianxian come today?”

“Feng Qianhua said, “She went to attend the birthday party of the daughter of the Zheng family.””

“Aunt Zhang nodded and looked around. She lowered her voice and said, “I noticed that Lin Ze has been acting a little strange lately.””

Feng Qianhua narrowed her eyes. “What’s Wrong?”

“”Ever since he came back from Yun Jing, he has been more and more filial to the old lady. But sometimes, he seems to be deliberately trying to trick the old lady.”Aunt Zhang thought about Lin Ze’s recent situation, then, she said, “Last time, he was rummaging through the warehouse upstairs.””

Feng Qianhua’s eyes flashed with a hint of gloominess. “Restless Little Bastard!”

“Ye Shu had already done such a shameless thing, but he still wouldn’t give up!”

“After saying that.., feng Qianhua continued, “Aunt Lin has already burned everything about ye Shu. I don’t think he can find anything! “But I’ll have to trouble you to take care of it during this period of time. If anything happens, you must let me know immediately!””

There was no fear in such matters.

Aunt Zhang nodded. “Don’t worry about it. I know.”

“At this moment, Feng Qianhua seemed to have suddenly heard something. She took out a red cloth bag from her pocket. “This is for you.””

“What is this?”Aunt Zhang was stunned.

“Feng Qianhua directly stuffed the item into Aunt Zhang’s hands. “No matter what it is, you can just keep it.””

“Aunt Zhang looked up at Feng Qianhua. “This is a bracelet, right?””

Feng Qianhua nodded.

“”I can’t take it,”aunt Zhang subconsciously refused.”
