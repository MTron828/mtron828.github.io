“The more Zhao shuning thought about it, the more flustered she became. ”

“The sudden fall of the Zhao family, her father had not forgiven her yet. It was a piece of cake for Lin Qingxuan to dump her. ”

No.

She could not let Lin Qingxuan dump her just like that.

Lin Qingxuan frowned slightly. He did not understand why Zhao shuning would be so sensitive about the adoption of a child.

“All these years, as long as he looked at other people’s children outside, Zhao shuning would say that he wouldn’t give birth to a child. ”

“So until now, the husband and wife didn’t adopt a child. ”

Zhao shuning didn’t even allow him to talk to other women outside.

“As long as that woman was a little closer to him, Zhao shuning would be suspicious and put things that he wouldn’t give birth to on the table. ”

“For example, the case of Ye Shu. ”

“He had only subconsciously said a few words for ye Shu, but Zhao shuning had already scolded ye Shu for being a Vixen! ”

“Perhaps, Zhao shuning wanted to be a mother too much. ”

“He had deprived Zhao shuning of her right to be a mother, and Zhao shuning had followed him for half her life. She was afraid that one day, she would suddenly dislike her and divorce her. After all, Zhao Shuning had already missed the best time to have children, therefore, it was normal for her to feel a little lost. ”

“Perhaps this feeling was the same as how he felt when he lost the ability to give birth, but he desperately wanted to have a child of his own. ”

“Every time she thought of this, all the anger in Lin Qingxuan’s heart would turn into a sigh. ”

“Compared to Zhao shuning’s grievance, what he had experienced was nothing? ”

“Lin Qingxuan took a deep breath, looked at Zhao shuning and said, “Shuning, I’m sorry. You’ll be in charge of the adoption from now on!” ”

“I want you to kneel down and swear to God!”

“Lin Qingxuan was used to kneeling down. Without saying anything, Lin Qingxuan immediately knelt down and swore to God. ”

“After hearing Lin Qingxuan’s oath, Zhao Shuning was satisfied. ”

On the other side.

East courtyard.

Old Lady Lin found Lin Jincheng and talked about Zhao Shuqi.

“In the end, Zhao Shuqi was implicated because of the Lin family’s matter. Old Lady Lin hoped that Lin Jincheng would show mercy. ”

“”Jincheng, that’s shuning’s brother after all. It’s Shuning’s family! Don’t you think you’ve gone too far?” ”

“”Mom, I’ll say it again. I didn’t do anything.”Lin Jincheng continued, “It’s the Zhao family’s Problem!” ”

“Old Lady Lin said domineeringly, “Jincheng, don’t think that I don’t know anything! Other than you, who else has the ability to do this?” ”

“Lin Jincheng laughed out loud, “Mom, do you really think that your son, I, have the ability to bring down the Zhao family directly?” ”

With that said.

“Old Lady Lin was stunned, “If it’s not you, who else could it be?” ”

“It couldn’t be that wild girl, could it? ”

How could a wild girl be so capable?

“After saying that, old madam Lin continued, “The Public Security Bureau said that they need that girl to personally make a trip before they can change her name. Ask her to make a trip with me tomorrow morning.” ”

“Lin Jincheng suppressed the anger in his heart. “Mom, I’ve said it before. I Won’t change Yaoyao’s name.” ”

Old Lady Lin knocked her crutches loudly. “Lin Jincheng! Are you my son or not? Don’t forget that I’m the one who gave you your life! What’s wrong with letting my granddaughter take my surname Now?”

“Ye Zhuo could take Lin Jincheng’s surname or her surname, but he couldn’t take ye Shu’s surname. ”

Old Lady Lin couldn’t stand a person with another surname who was always hanging around under her nose.

“”I can finally see that you are such a heartless child. Qianhua has waited for you for so many years, yet you turned a blind eye to it! is that ye Shu that good?” Old Lady Lin’s eyes reddened. “Don’t forget, my life was saved by Qianhua! Have a conscience and ask yourself, if it weren’t for Qianhua, would I still be alive today?” ”

“Back then, Old Mrs. Lin had almost died from a serious illness. If it weren’t for Feng Qianhua’s constant delivery of health soup, she would have died a long time ago. ”

“In Old Mrs. Lin’s opinion, Feng Qianhua was her savior. ”

Feng Qianhua was even closer to her than her own daughter-in-law.

“She treated Feng Xianxian like her own granddaughter, ”

why did she like Feng Xianxian so much?

“It was all because Feng Xianxian had grown up by her side, obedient and obedient. ”

“If she wanted to change Feng Xianxian’s surname, Feng Xianxian would definitely not say anything to refuse. ”

“She was nothing like Ye Zhuo, her biological granddaughter. ”

She had actually caused so much trouble!

Her biological granddaughter could not be compared to someone who was not related by blood.
