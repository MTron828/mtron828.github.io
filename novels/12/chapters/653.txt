Translator: 549690339

Master Zhou was stunned. “You... Are You Sure?”

How Old Was Ye Zhuo?

Nineteen years old!

Could she be that powerful? Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Master Yu smiled and said, “Although I’m old, I’m not muddle-headed. I wouldn’t joke about the future of the literary world. I didn’t Take Ye Zhuo as my disciple out of consideration for anyone, but ye Zhuo has the ability to do so!””

“After saying that, master Yu continued, “And I believe that her achievements are far beyond the literary world. As long as she’s willing, she can make a name for herself in all fields.””

“Seeing that master Yu was so confident in ye Zao, Master Zhou paused and didn’t say anything.”

He hoped that ye Zao really had the ability to not betray Master Yu’s trust.

“After a long while, master Zhou said, “Alright, then the assessment in three months, should we let Miss Ye test her mettle?””

The literary world would hold an assessment competition every six months.

The main test would be the literary ability and calligraphy of the members of the literary world.

Those who failed the preliminary assessment would be forced to withdraw from the literary world.

Whether or not ye Zhuo had the real ability would depend on the assessment competition.

“That’s for sure!”Master Yu nodded.

“Ye Zhuo was his newly accepted closed-door foundation. If he did not participate in the assessment, he would definitely not be able to convince the public.”

He would even be mistaken as someone who came in through the back door.

“In fact, some people were already beginning to think so.”

In the banquet hall.

“After master Yu left, everyone was discussing in low voices.”

None of them had expected that master Yu would take ye Zhuo in as a disciple.

How did ye Zhuo become Master Yu’s last disciple?

Could it be because of Old Lady Lin’s relationship?

“Ye Zao sat at the main seat. His expression was the same as before, as if he had not heard these words.”

“Hearing these questioning words, Feng Xianxian’s face finally regained some color.”

“Ye Zao did not have this diamond diamond, yet he still wanted to take on this porcelain job!”

It was simply a huge joke.

Just wait to lose face!

“Seeing Master Zhou outside again, Feng Xianxian wanted to brush up on her presence. After all, master Zhou had a good impression of her.”

“Feng Xianxian turned to look at Old Lady Lin. “Grandma, I’m going outside to get some fresh air.””

“”Okay,”old lady lin continued, “Do you need me to accompany you?””

“No need.”Feng Xianxian shook her head.

“As soon as she arrived outside, a gentle female voice sounded in the air. “Miss Feng.””

Feng Xianxian raised her head and saw that the other party was a young woman wearing a light yellow gown. Her facial features were beautiful and her aura was transcendent.

If she remembered correctly.

“This person was the vice president of the Chinese Arts Association, Liu Caiyi.”

“President Liu.”Feng Xianxian raised her head and looked at Liu Caiyi.

“Liu Caiyi directly explained the purpose of her visit. “In three months, there will be an assessment competition in the literary world. Are you interested in participating?””

“Feng Xianxian narrowed her eyes. “President Liu, from what I know, this assessment competition shouldn’t be something that can be participated in just because you’re interested, right?””

The literary world’s assessment was extremely valuable.

The people who participated were either members of the literary world or the personal disciples of various masters.

The assessment was also a promotion competition.

“After passing the preliminary examination, they would be promoted to a 1, then a 2, a 3, a 4, a 5, and finally an S grade. The S grades were divided into S 1 and S 5, then SS1-SS5, with the highest grade being SSS9.”

“At present, other than master Yu being SSS9, master Yu’s eldest disciple was also SSS9.”

“Unfortunately, this eldest disciple’s ambition was not in the literary world. Otherwise, he would definitely become the successor of the literary world.”

“Liu Caiyi continued, “As long as Miss Feng wants to participate, I have a way to let you participate.””

“Really?”Feng Xianxian’s eyes lit up.

Feng Qianqian really hoped to participate in this assessment competition.

“As Master Yu’s last disciple, Ye Zhuo would definitely participate in this assessment competition.”

She wanted to publicly slap ye Zhuo’s face! She wanted to prove in front of master Yu that she was the most outstanding!

Ye Zhuo was destined to be crushed by her.

“Of course.”Liu Caiyi nodded.

“”President Liu, can I ask why you want to help me?”Liu Caiyi was not a simple person. Because she stood tall, Liu Caiyi was usually very aloof and aloof. She rarely took the initiative to befriend anyone.”

Feng Xianxian subconsciously felt that Liu Caiyi must have some motive.

“Liu caiyi smiled and said, “I just don’t want to see the literary world lose a talent, and I don’t want to see Master Yu regret it. I believe that you will definitely shine in the literary world!”Liu Caiyi was even more embarrassed to see people using underhanded methods to enter the literary world.”

“Ye Zhuo had relied on his connections to become master Yu’s disciple, so she definitely would not be able to pass the assessment.”

“After all, the assessment was based on true ability.”

“”Thank you, President Liu.”Feng Xianxian stood up and bowed to Liu Caiyi.”
