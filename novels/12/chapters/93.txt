Chapter 94: 075: Heal and save, Brother and sister meet

Old Master Yang was the backbone of the Yang family.

If Old Master Yang left, the other branches of the Yang family would definitely suppress him.

At that time.

The entire Yang family would be in turmoil.

Although Mu Yourong looked quite young, she said that she had the medicine that could cure Old Master Yang. Yang Danian really didn’t want to miss this opportunity.

“Miss Mu, can your medicine really cure my father?”Yang Danian asked somewhat worriedly.

Mu Yourong nodded. “Mister Yang, other than me, I’m afraid no one can cure old Mister Yang.” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Yang Danian continued, “Then can I ask Miss Mu to take out the medicine for me to take a look?”

Mu Yourong nodded and took out a small wooden box from her bag.

The small wooden box looked very simple and unadorned.

Opening the wooden box, she saw a black pill lying inside.

Its appearance looked extremely similar to millet.

Yang Danian frowned, “Just, just this one pill, can it really cure my father?”

Mu yourong smiled and said, “Please Don’t underestimate this pill. This is a spirit medicine. I can guarantee that as long as Old Master Yang eats this pill, he will be able to cure his illness!”

The system was a very powerful existence.

The medicine that was exchanged from the system could not be bought outside.

It would definitely be able to get rid of the illness!

Yang Danian still did not dare to believe it.

If that was really the case, it would be too miraculous.

One had to know that even foreign professors were helpless against their father’s illness.

“Then does this medicine have any side effects?”Yang Danian asked.

Mu Yourong was stunned.

She only knew that this medicine could cure old master Yang. She really did not know if there were any side effects.

But at this time, even if there were side effects, it could only be said that there were none.

Otherwise, how could the Yang family trust her?

Moreover, Old Master Yang was already so old. Even if there were side effects, it did not matter much.

Mu yourong smiled and continued, “Mr. Yang, don’t worry. This medicine doesn’t have any side effects on the human body.”

In order to make Yang Danian trust her, Mu Yourong continued, “Mr. Yang, to be honest, I am the successor of the Godly Doctor Hua Tuo! This medicine has been passed down from generation to generation in my family.”

The successor of Hua Tuo?

The Godly Doctor Hua Tuo had always only existed in history textbooks.

Yang Danian did not expect to see the Divine Doctor Hua Tuo’s successor one day.

How much credibility did she have in her words?

Also, for no reason at all, why would mu yourong take the initiative to find him and even give the medicine passed down from her ancestors to Old Master Yang?

She saw through Yang Danian’s doubts.

Mu yourong continued, “People don’t do useless things. If you want to ask me why I gave the family’s divine medicine to Old Master Yang, I will tell you that I need the Yang family’s help.”

After saying this, Mu Yourong added, “Of course, before Old Master Yang fully recovers, I will not ask the Yang family for any help.”

Speaking up to this point, Mu Yourong paused and raised her head to look at Yang Danian.

“So, Mr. Yang, you don’t have to worry that I’m lying to you, because lying to you will not benefit me in any way.”

Hearing this, Yang Danian felt much more at ease.

After all, Mu Yourong had a motive.

He was most afraid of having no motive for no reason at all.

...

On the other side.

When Old Master Yang heard that the little girl not far away was having fun in the snow, it was the person who had saved people on the plane that day. His eyes revealed a look of disbelief.

He saw that there was no difference between that child and an ordinary child. They both had the nature of playing, and when they saw the snow, they were extremely excited. So it turned out that she actually had this ability?

“Old Man, I heard from that little girl last time that Chinese medicine emphasizes the fate of doctors. If we meet her here again today, it might be a kind of fate. Why don’t we ask her to take a look at you?”Sun Fu Nian persuaded.

Old Man Yang originally didn’t have any hope for his own body.

Hearing this, a layer of hope appeared in his eyes.

“Since that’s the case, then let’s go over.”

Seeing that the old man had finally relented, Sun Fonian was extremely excited. He no longer cared about the heavy snowfall in the sky. He held onto the old man’s arm and said, “Let’s Go! Let’s go over quickly!”

The two of them came to ye Zao’s side.

“Little Miracle Doctor!”

Ye Zao was pinching a snow ball and was about to hit Lin Sha. Hearing that, she quickly put down the snow ball.

“Elders, are you calling me?”

Sun Fulian nodded. “Yes! Little Miracle Doctor, your surname is Ye, right?”

“My surname is Ye. I don’t dare to call myself a miracle doctor.”Ye Zao continued, “May I ask what is the matter?”
