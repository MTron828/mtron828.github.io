“No matter how the crowd called out to Ye Zhuo, there was no response from ye Zhuo. ”

“Cen Hai raised his head to look at Cen Jiang. “Brother, what if we can’t contact Miss Ye?” ”

“Cen Hu was on the verge of tears. “Y-miss ye won’t be in trouble, right? !” ”

“Shut your Jinx Mouth!”Cen he directly gave Cen Hu a slap. “Miss Ye won’t be in trouble!”

“Cen Hu would not have let Cen he off so easily under normal circumstances, but today was different. Not only did Cen Hu not make a fuss, he said instead, “Yes, yes, yes. Miss ye will definitely be fine.” ”

“Cen Jiang was also very anxious now, but he had no choice but to calm himself down. He continued, “All of you wait here. I’ll go to the Northwest District to look for Miss Ye.” ”

“No matter how dangerous the Northwest District was now, he had to go there personally! ”

“Cen Hai said, “I’ll go with you!” ”

“Yu Zifei immediately said, “I want to go too!” ”

“”And we also have to go together,”Cen Hu, Cen He, and Ma Fangfei also said. ”

“They were all people who had followed ye Zao from the beginning and were absolutely loyal to ye Zao. Now That Ye Zao’s whereabouts were unknown, the few of them were very anxious and wished that they could replace ye Zao! ”

“Cen Jiang said as he walked in, “Don’t cause trouble. Wait here. What if Miss Ye comes back and sees that we’re not here? What do you want her to do? So, I’ll Go! If you can’t contact me in two hours, immediately return to Earth and request for reinforcements!” ”

“Since he had decided to go look for ye Zao, Cen Jiang had prepared for the worst. ”

“”Brother!”Cen Hai looked at Cen Jiang, his eyes slightly red. ”

“Cen Jiang was the leader among the four brothers, but usually, the other three never called him brother Cen Jiang. Instead, they called him Big Jiang. ”

“Cen Jiang patted Cen Hai’s shoulder. “Don’t worry. Even if I die in a sea of fire, I will definitely bring miss ye back.” ”

“Cen he and Cen Hu looked at Cen Jiang and then said, “Brother, pay attention to your safety.” ”

“”Okay.”Cen Jiang put on his glasses, opened the door of the aircraft, sat inside, and prepared to leave. ”

Yu Zifei held the observer and looked at the rolling magma in front of him. He had a bad feeling.

The situation in the northwest region was too terrible.

“If ye Zhuo was really unfortunate enough to be hit by the magma, there was almost no chance of survival. ”

At the same time.

On the other side.

Director Ma received Ma Fangfei’s message.

“What did you say? Miss Ye is missing?”Director Ma was very surprised. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Ma Fangfei stood in the cockpit, she lowered her voice and said, “Dad, please lower your voice! Are you afraid that others won’t hear you? Right now, Cen Jiang has gone to look for Miss Ye. He wants us to contact master five to request for backup if we can’t contact him in two hours!” ”

“Director ma continued, “Fangfei, are you sure you can’t contact Miss Ye Now?” ”

“”En.”Ma Fangfei’s eyes were a little red. “The current situation in the northwest district is very bad. Dad, do you think something really happened to Miss Ye?” ”

“”Don’t worry.”Director ma consoled, “Miss Ye is blessed by the heavens. Nothing will happen to her.” ”

“Ma fangfei continued, “You don’t know the situation here at all. The temperature of the magma is as high as 1,300 degrees Celsius...” ”

“Before Ma Fangfei could finish her sentence, director Ma interrupted her, “Fangfei, don’t be anxious. Miss ye will definitely be fine! I have other matters to attend to, so I won’t talk to you anymore.”After that, director Ma directly hung up the phone. ”

“After hanging up the phone, director Ma rushed to Professor Feng’s office. ”

“Professor Feng was writing the experiment report. When he saw director Ma rush over, he raised his head in confusion. “Director Ma, What’s Wrong With You? Why are you in such a hurry?” ”

Director ma closed the office door and then closed the curtains.

“Seeing him like this, professor Feng became even more curious. “What’s Wrong?” ”

“Director ma lowered his voice and said, “I have good news for you.” ”

“Good News?”Professor Feng frowned. “What Good News?”

“Director ma continued, “Miss Ye lost contact on Mars. When Fangfei spoke to me, she said that Miss Ye is probably doomed.” ”

“What?”Professor Feng’s face turned pale. “How could this be?”

Director ma shook his head. “I’m not too sure about the details. I heard from Fangfei that miss ye seemed to be looking for something and happened to encounter a large-scale volcanic eruption. Do you think this is good news?”

“”Miss Ye’s life and death are unknown. What kind of good news is this?”Professor Feng looked up at director Ma, his face full of anger. ”
