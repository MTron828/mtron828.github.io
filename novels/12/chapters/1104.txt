“Chapter 1105: 243: face-smacking hot online, strong cleaning house! 1”

“Sure enough, once Sun Yiran said this, everyone looked at ye Zao as if they were watching a show. ”

The Chinese version.

“If ye Zao was someone else, it would have been fine. ”

But Ye Zao was a descendant of the Ye family.

A dignified descendant of the ye family actually wanted to see the Chinese version of the corporate culture.

“If this wasn’t a joke, then what was? ”

One had to know.

Even the cleaning auntie in the consortium knew how to finance.

But Ye Zhuo didn’t understand.

What did this mean?

It meant that ye Zhuo couldn’t even compare to a cleaning auntie.

“A person who didn’t even know how to finance, what qualifications did he have to compete with Sun Yiran for the position of President? ”

“Oh my God! Didn’t they say that Auntie Lang’s granddaughter is also a talented girl? Why doesn’t she know how to finance?”

“Vice-president sun is too unlucky! He actually lost to such a person!”

“There’s nothing we can do. She has a good great-great-grandfather and a good grandmother!”

“It’s really different from the same person!”

The crowd kept sighing.

Everyone was defending Sun Yiran. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“At this moment, ye Zhuo slightly raised his eyes. “Vice-president Sun, what did you say this is?” ”

“Sun yiran said, “The corporate culture of our Shunxi Financial Group.” ”

“Are you sure this is our Shunxi Financial Group’s?”Ye Zhuo’s brows were still furrowed as he repeated the question.

“Sun Yiran said with a smile, “This is the corporate culture of our Shunxi Financial Group. However, this is financial culture, so it’s normal that you don’t know it, Miss Ye! Oh, right, Miss Ye, you must still not know what financial culture is, right? “A financial system is a language unique to our financial world. It doesn’t circulate in the outside world. “Could it be that Aunt Lang didn’t tell you about it when she was at home?” ”

“Once these words were said, the discussion of the crowd became even louder. ”

“It can’t be! She really doesn’t know about a financial system!”

“Step down! The position of President is originally Miss Sun’s!”

“”Old Ye and Aunt Lang are both very capable people. I didn’t expect the descendants of the Ye family to not even know the most basic financial system! If such a person becomes the head of the consortium, then our consortium will sooner or later be defeated by her!” ”

“Hearing these words, the SMUG look on Sun Yiran’s face became even more obvious. ”

She wanted to make ye Zhuo embarrassed in public.

Ye Zhuo wanted to fight with her?

He was still young!

“Whoever didn’t let her have it easy, she wouldn’t let anyone have it easy. ”

“If she couldn’t be the president, then ye Zhuo could forget about it! ”

Everything that happened in front of her was within Zhao Xueyin’s expectations.

She had long known that Sun Yiran would definitely try to make things difficult for ye Zhuo.

“However, Zhao Xueyin had not expected that Sun Yiran would actually come up with a big move. ”

“Ye Zhuo did not even know the financial system, so he indeed did not have the qualifications to take the position of president. ”

Zhao Xueyin just looked at the two of them like this.

The winner takes all.

“In any case, no matter how much this fire burned, it would not be able to burn her. ”

“Now, it was up to Sun Yiran to see if she had the ability to drive ye Zhuo out of the financial world. ”

Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes and very well concealed the expression in her eyes.

Just as everyone was waiting to see ye Zhuo make a fool of himself.

“PA –”

Ye Zhuo directly threw the documents in his hands onto the table and opened his red lips slightly:

“”Vice President Sun, take a good look at which financial group’s corporate culture this is. Is it that I don’t know the financial system, or are you making a fool of yourself!” ”

“Although her tone was faint, it was loud and clear. Every word hit everyone’s heart. ”

“That! That is the corporate culture introduction of the Jin Financial Group!”

Someone in the crowd recognized the corporate culture book on the table.

“Hearing this, Sun Yiran quickly looked down. ”

With this look.

Her face immediately turned pale.

It was really the corporate culture of the Jin Financial Group.

“These days, Sun Yiran had been quite interested in Jin Ruyu of the Jin Financial Group. ”

“Jin Ruyu was 28 years old and still single. If she could marry Jin Ruyu, she would be the Crown Princess of the Jin Financial Group in the future. ”

“In order to understand Jin Ruyu, Sun Yiran also studied the corporate culture of the Jin Financial Group. ”

But she didn’t expect that she would take the wrong one...

She also didn’t expect ye Zhuo to know the financial system.

How did ye Zhuo know it?

Ye Langhua had just recognized her biological daughter and was reunited with Ye Zhuo and the others less than three months ago.

The financial system was different from the Chinese characters. It was much more complicated than the Chinese characters.

How did ye Zhuo know the financial system in such a short time?

It was precisely because she felt that ye Zhuo didn’t know the financial system that Sun Yiran deliberately showed the corporate culture to Ye Zhuo.

“She did not expect ye Zao not only to know about the financial system, but also to recognize that this was not the corporate culture of the Shunxi Financial Group. ”

What should she do now?

Sun Yiran swallowed her throat.

“Before Sun Yiran could react, ye Zao turned to look at Zhao Xueyin by the side. His eyes were bright and colorful. He raised his chin slightly, and his face seemed to be covered with a layer of snow. ”
