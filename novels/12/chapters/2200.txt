“Master Cao said that Manwen was worthless, but even the worthless Manwen was supported by people, while the stunning man Xing was not. Didn’t this mean that the outstanding man Xing could not even compare to half of the Manwen? ”

“After saying that, the vice president continued, “Master Cao, do you have any objections?” ” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Any objections?

What other objections could he have?

“The biggest difference between man Xing and man Wen was that man Wen had someone backing him up, but man Xing did not! ”

What was going on!

Why were these people suddenly standing behind man Wen?

Could it be that man Wen had been hiding his strength all this time?

“If that was really the case, man Wen’s strength was too terrifying. ”

“All these years, man Wen had been loitering under his nose, and he did not notice the slightest abnormality. ”

“At this moment, Manxing stood up at the right time, he said gently, “Mr. Vice President, Manwen is my younger brother. As his sister, I’m happy for him that he can replace my father. I hope he can worry about the country and the people and be a good president.” ”

“After saying that, Manxing looked at master cao. “Master, didn’t you say that your head wasn’t feeling well when you came? Let’s go, I’ll take you to the hospital.” ”

“At this moment, master Cao could only walk down the stairs. ”

Man Xing held master Cao’s arm and the two of them walked out.

“After turning around, man Xing’s expression immediately turned dark. ”

Dark clouds covered the sky.

Master Cao raised his head to look at her and sighed.

“Originally, man Xing was determined to win this election. ”

Who would have thought...

“”Xing ‘er, don’t worry.”Master Cao patted man Xing’s arm and continued, “It’s not too late for a gentleman to take revenge. One day, we will avenge ourselves.” ”

“Okay.”Manxing nodded with an inexplicable expression.

“Inside, although Manxing and master Cao had left, the election ceremony was still going on. ”

“Manwen stood on the stage, read the President’s speech, and immediately accepted the interview from the reporters. ”

“Looking at Manwen who was being interviewed, Fan Mu was very excited. ”

He had never thought that Manwen would actually become the 189th President of Manxing.

“After accepting the interview from the reporters, Man Wen came to the audience. He wanted to find Shi Qingcheng, Ye Han, and the others to thank them and ask them what had happened. However, when he came to the audience, they had already left. ”

“Where are they?”Man Wen looked at Fan Mu.

“Fan Mu asked, “Are you talking about officer Shi and chief ye?” ”

“Yes.”Man Wen nodded.

“Fan Mu said, “Not long after your second sister left, they left.” ”

“After saying that, fan mu continued, “You’re good, brother. You’re good. I originally thought that if it weren’t for Miss Ye, you definitely wouldn’t be able to turn things around. I didn’t expect that other than Miss Ye, you have other backers!” ”

“”I didn’t find them,”man wen continued, “Furthermore, I’m not familiar with them.” ”

“What?”

“Hearing that, fan mu stared at man Wen with wide eyes. ”

“Man Wen said very seriously, “I’m not joking with you. I’m really not familiar with them.” ”

“Then why did they help you?”Fan Mu asked.

Man Wen shook his head.

“However, he already had a vague answer in his heart. ”

It should be related to ye Zhuo.

“Other than ye Zhuo, he could not think of anyone else. ”

“Fan Mu continued, “Could it be your eldest sister? Ye Han is your sister’s adopted younger brother. Mr. Leo, Mr. Feng, and Miss ye are also close friends. If they didn’t come because of you, it must be because of your eldest sister!” ”

“At this point, fan mu paused, “That’s not right! If I remember correctly, Shi Qingcheng should be your second sister’s teacher. I also haven’t heard of any relationship between Shi Qingcheng and your eldest sister. Why Is Shi Qingcheng Here? You Don’t even know. At first, I thought that Shi Qingcheng must have come to speak for your second sister!” ”

Man Wen didn’t say anything.

“After a moment, fan mu sighed and continued, “I think it’s mostly because of your eldest sister!” ”

“Other than ye Zhuo, no one else had the ability to gather all these famous big shots in one place. ”

“”Looks like I misunderstood miss ye previously. I’m here to apologize to Miss Ye!”After saying that, fan mu even bowed to the air as if it was a matter of fact. “Miss Ye, please forgive me.” ”

“Man Wen frowned slightly. He turned to look at fan mu and continued, “You really didn’t say anything to her?” ”

“”Say What?”Fan Mu was stunned. He didn’t understand what man Wen meant for a short time. After a while, he continued, “I didn’t say anything! If you don’t believe me, you can send someone to investigate!” ”

“What about Wen Yang?”Man Wen asked.
