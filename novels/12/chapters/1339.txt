Translator: 549690339

Didn’t know?

How could Cen Shaoqing not know?

Unless Zhou Xiang didn’t tell him!

Zhou Xiang was a fool who couldn’t do anything but ruin everything!

Xie wanqiu wished she could slap Zhou Xiang to death right now.

“”I’ll go down and tell cousin about this now,”Zheng Wanyin continued. ”

“”Wait a minute,”Xie wanqiu called out to Zheng Wanyin’s back. ”

“”Grandma, is there anything else?”Zheng Wanyin turned around. ”

“Don’t make it sound so deliberate.”

Zheng Wanyin nodded. “I know.”

Zheng Wanyin came downstairs. She wanted to have a chance encounter with Cen Shaoqing and then inadvertently tell Cen Shaoqing about Xie Wanqiu’s hospitalization.

Who knew that she could not find Cen Shaoqing even after searching the entire hospital lobby.

Could he have gone back already?

Zheng Wanyin frowned.

“”Wanyin.”At this moment, a familiar voice sounded in the air. ”

Zheng Wanyin turned around and saw that it was Zhou Xiang.

“Second aunt.”

“When she saw Zhou Xiang, the corners of Zheng Wanyin’s mouth curled up into a smile. ”

“Zhou Xiang walked forward. “Wanyin, how’s Your Grandmother’s condition now?” ”

“Xie wanqiu had been staying in the hospital all this while, and Zhou Xiang was really anxious. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have secretly come to the hospital to see Xie wanqiu behind old Madam Cen’s back. ”

Only peace and harmony could bring prosperity to everything.

“As long as the two elders were fine, it wouldn’t be a big deal for her to suffer a little. ”

“Zheng Wanyin shook her head. “It’s still the same. Moreover, grandmother’s appetite has been very bad recently!” ”

“The two of them talked as they walked. In a short while, they arrived at Xie Wanqiu’s ward. ”

“Xie wanqiu used to stay in a normal ward. The normal ward was fine during the day, but at night, all kinds of snoring could be heard. She couldn’t sleep well at all, so Xie Wanqiu transferred to the VIP Ward. ”

“Zheng Wanyin lowered her voice and said, “Grandma has been waiting for cousin-in-law to come over and admit her mistake, but there has been no news from cousin-in-law, so Grandma is in a bad mood. If she says something unpleasant later, second aunt, please bear with her.” ”

“Okay.”Zhou Xiang nodded. “I know. She’s my mother. Can I still be calculative with her?”

Zhou Xiang was never a calculative person.

“That’s good.”

“After saying that, Zheng Wanyin pushed the door open. “Grandma, Look Who’s here to see you.” ”

“Hearing the commotion outside, Xie wanqiu immediately turned off her phone and looked outside. ”

“When she looked outside, she saw Zhou Xiang. ”

Xie wanqiu immediately lay on her side with her back facing Zhou Xiang. Her tone was very unpleasant. “Why are you here?”

“Zhou Xiang said, “I came to see you. Are You Alright?” ”

“”Don’t worry, I Won’t die,”Xie wanqiu continued, “Besides, don’t You Wish For me to die earlier?” ”

“Although Zhou Xiang disliked Xie wanqiu, he did not curse her to die. ”

“No matter what, Xie Wanqiu was still her stepmother. ”

Wasn’t there an old saying?

All parents are alike!

She could only blame her bad luck for having a stepmother like Xie wanqiu.

“Moreover, she was already married. No matter how much trouble Xie Wanqiu had, she would not be able to do it for a few days in a year. ”

“Hearing that, Zhou Xiang immediately explained, “Mom, what are you saying? Why would I want you to die!” ”

Xie wanqiu snorted coldly. “Stop pretending. Don’t you know who you are?”

“”Mom, I really don’t!” ”

Xie Wanqiu did not say anything else.

“Zheng Wanyin said from the side, “Grandma, don’t be angry. Actually, second aunt really cares about you. On the way to the ward just now, she has been concerned about your health.” ”

“Xie wanqiu said sarcastically, “Concerned! Of course I have to be concerned. If she doesn’t care about me, how would she know when I’m going to die! Knowing that my life is not in danger for the time being, she’s extremely disappointed!” ”

“”Mom, I really haven’t thought about it that way.”Zhou Xiang continued, “I’m here to pick you up. The hospital is too noisy. How can it be more comfortable than staying at home? You should come back with me.” ”

Pick her up?

Zhou Xiang was really daydreaming.

“Xie wanqiu said, “Have you forgotten what I Told You?” ” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Zhou Xiang said with a troubled expression, “Mom, Zhuoluo is very busy every day. Moreover, she knows that she’s wrong. Why Don’t you let me apologize to you on her behalf? Don’t bother with her!”After such a thing happened.., zhou Xiang could only hide it from both sides and apologize on behalf of Ye Zhuoluo. ”

“She knew Xie Wanqiu too well. If she didn’t give Xie wanqiu a way out, Xie wanqiu would really go on and on. ”

As long as Xie wanqiu calmed down.
