“Milai said, “Miss Jiang has already left.” ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“A moment later, she turned on her computer and clicked the mouse with her right hand. ”

The screen of the Heavenly Eye system immediately appeared on the computer screen.

Ye Zhuo switched the page and the screen quickly turned to a surveillance screen.

The screen was somewhat familiar.

“If someone familiar was present, they would definitely notice that this was Zhao Xueyin’s office. ”

1 pm.

Zhao Xueyin was sitting at her desk and processing documents.

“A minute later, Annie walked in with Jiang Xiaoyu. ”

The first scene was very normal.

Zhao Xueyin even poured Jiang Xiaoyu a cup of coffee.

“Then, just as Jiang Xiaoyu said, she opened her mouth to ask for Zhao Xueyin’s help. ”

But Zhao Xueyin made an excessive request and gave Jiang Xiaoyu a pill.

Jiang Xiaoyu naturally refused.

“Then, Zhao Xueyin made another request. ”

To make Jiang Xiaoyu bark like a dog.

“Seeing this, ye Zao frowned slightly. ”

What surprised ye Zao even more was that Jiang Xiaoyu actually did it.

But.

Zhao Xueyin didn’t keep her promise!

No wonder Jiang Xiaoyu cried so miserably!

“A moment later, ye Zhuo turned off the surveillance footage and leaned against the back of the chair. There was no expression on his handsome face. ”

“Big Burning.”

Little White squeezed in from outside the door.

“”Doggie, why are you here?”Ye Zhuo looked up slightly. ”

“Little White said, “I brought the silly cat to see your duck!” ”

“Where’s the silly cat?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“Silly cat? The silly cat is in my pocket!”Little White looked down and saw that the pocket was empty. There was no sign of Brother Meow? It was so scared that its face turned pale. “Where’s the silly cat! F * ck! The silly cat is gone!”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Are you sure you brought the silly cat with you?” ”

“Of course! I even chatted with it on the way!”Little White hurriedly walked out. “I’m not going to talk to you about spicy! I’m going to look for the silly cat first! The silly cat is so silly. What if someone sells it!”

“Go ahead.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

Little White rushed out to look for brother Meow.

“When Zhao Xueyin came out of the office, she saw a fat cat in the corridor. ”

“Where did the cat come from?”

“When it heard the word ‘cat,’fat meow immediately ran over and rubbed Zhao Xueyin’s feet. ”

“The employee at the side replied, “It seems to be President Ye’s cat.” ”

Ye Zhuo’s Cat?

“Hearing this, Zhao Xueyin’s eyes were filled with disgust. She immediately kicked it away. “The B * stards raised by B * stards are all so B * stards! They pounce on people when they see them! They’re not disgusted at all!” ”

“Fat Meow was kicked a few meters away and hit the pillar. It cried out in pain, “Meow!”Then, it quickly raised one of its feet and ran to the side. ”

“The staff at the side could not bear it, but they could not say anything. ”

“When Whitey found brother Meow, Brother Meow was squatting in the corner, looking like he had been abandoned. ”

“Silly cat! I’ve finally found you! Where did you run off to!”Whitey picked up brother Meow and put it in its pocket.

“Meow!”

“Whitey continued, “Looks like I have to put a tracker on you! You’re so silly. What if you get lost one day?” ”

“Meow!”

...

On the other side.

Zhao family.

“Ever since yesterday, Father Zhao had a high fever. ”

It was 39 degrees.

“The two doctors took turns to look after Father Zhao, but they were unable to bring his fever down. ”

Zhao Xueyin came back from the financial group and immediately went to see Father Zhao.

“Father Zhao was lying on the bed. Because of the high fever, his face was very red. ”

“”Doctor Wang, how is My Father Now?”Zhao Xueyin asked with concern. ”

“Doctor Wang said, “He just received a special anti-fever injection. His fever should subside in half an hour. He’ll be fine once his fever subsides.” ”

“”Okay, thank you for your hard work.” ”

“Doctor Wang said a little embarrassedly, “This is what I should do. You’re too polite.” ”

“Zhao Xueyin continued, “You’ve been tired all day. Go and rest first. I’ll look after my father.” ”

“Doctor Wang nodded. “If there’s anything unusual, just let me know.” ”

“Okay.”

Zhao Xueyin sat beside Father Zhao’s bed.

“Actually, Father Zhao was doing quite well. ”

“At the very least, she didn’t have to hear his voice anymore. ”

“All these years, because she wasn’t a boy, Father Zhao had given her a lot of looks. ”

“At this moment, Father Zhao, who was on the bed, suddenly said, “A Ye... a Ye...” ”

His voice was very soft.

It was close to a whisper.

“Zhao Xueyin was slightly unable to hear what he was saying, and she could only roughly hear the word ‘Ye’. ”

“”Father, what are you saying? Father, wake up!” ”

“Father Zhao acted as if he did not hear Zhao Xueyin’s call, and in the next second, tears flowed out from the corners of his eyes. “Father, father, father, I... I miss you...” ”

“This time, Zhao Xueyin heard it clearly. ”

Father Misses You so much?

Could it be that Father Zhao missed his grandfather?

Her grandfather was Father Zhao’s father.

It was said that only people who were about to die would think of their parents who had died prematurely.

Father Zhao had a high fever for no reason...

Could it be...

“Thinking of this, Zhao Xue’s heart thumped. “Father, are you alright? Father! Wake up quickly!” ”

“Father Zhao’s eyes were tightly shut. This time, he did not speak again, but tears kept rolling down his face. ”

It was late at night when Father Zhao’s fever subsided.

He woke up from the dream.

“Father Zhao looked at the ceiling, his eyes filled with sadness. ”

“In the dream, he and a Ye were finally reunited. ”

Unfortunately.

He woke up very soon.

It was said that the dream was reversed.

Did this mean that he and a ye would never see each other again?

“At this moment, the sound of footsteps came from the room. ”

“”Dad, you’re awake!”Seeing that Father Zhao had woken up, Zhao Xueyin was especially excited. ”

“Xueyin.”

“Zhao Xueyin helped Father Zhao sit up. “Dad, do you want some water?” ”

Father Zhao nodded.

Zhao Xueyin brought some water.

“After drinking the water, Zhao Xueyin put the cup back to its original place and continued, “Dad, I know that I’ve disappointed you these few days! But don’t worry, I’ll definitely lead our Zhao family to the peak of the financial world!” ”

Father Zhao nodded.

“Zhao Xueyin continued, “There’s something I forgot to tell you.” ”

“What is it?”Father Zhao turned to look at Zhao Xueyin.

“Zhao Xueyin continued, “Do you still remember the international financial conference two months ago?” ”

“Yes.”Father Zhao nodded.

“Zhao Xueyin said, “At the financial conference, I saw Master Five! To be precise, master five should have seen me. So, dad, please rest assured, I will definitely let master five marry me!” ”

“Hearing this, Father Zhao immediately sat up straight, and a light flashed in his eyes. “You didn’t lie to me?” ”

“”Dad, do you think I would use such a thing to lie to you?”Zhao Xueyin continued, “On the day that elder Zhang organized the welcoming banquet for Ye Zhuo, master five even sent people to send gifts. Do you think that under normal circumstances, master five would condescend to send people to send gifts?” ”

Of course not!

Who Was Master Five?

Everyone had always been fighting to give him a gift. When did he give a gift to others?

Father Zhao narrowed his eyes. “How can you be so sure that master five isn’t giving a gift to Ye Zhuo?”

“Giving a gift to ye Zhuo?”The corners of Zhao Xueyin’s mouth curled up in disdain. “Is she even worthy?”

“If Master Five’s surname was Cen, it would be fine. ”

But the fifth master’s surname was Bai.

It had nothing to do with Cen Shaoqing at all.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only
