Translator: 549690339

“In the blink of an eye, it was the next morning. ”

“Zhao Xueyin thought that after applying the ointment, the redness and swelling on her face would disappear. However, when she looked in the mirror, the redness and swelling on her face did not disappear. Instead, it became even more red and swollen! ”

It was a shocking sight.

What was going on?

Zhao Xueyin’s eyes were filled with panic.

Could it be that there was something wrong with the ointment?

“She wouldn’t be disfigured because of this, right? ”

Zhao Xueyin put on her sunglasses and mask and went to the hospital without even eating breakfast.

“After the doctor’s examination, there was nothing wrong with the ointment. ”

“When she heard that there was nothing wrong with the ointment, Zhao Xueyin heaved a sigh of relief and continued, “Then can I trouble you to prescribe some medicine to reduce the swelling?” ”

“The doctor continued, “This ointment of yours has a very good effect on reducing the swelling. I’ll prescribe some anti-inflammatory medicine for you.” ”

“Okay.”Zhao Xueyin nodded.

“Just as Zhao Xueyin left with the list of medicine prescribed by the doctor, the nurses in the department started discussing among themselves. “She’s Zhao Xueyin, right? The one who abused the cat?” ”

“I think so!”

“TSK! This is karma! I wish that her face will rot soon. It would be best if she loses another layer of skin!”

At the same time.

Zhao family.

“The manager of the financial world came to the Zhao family, “Mr. Zhao, Miss Zhao’s actions have seriously affected the order of the financial world. “I’ll give you one week. Please move out of Jing fan center immediately. “If it’s overdue, our management department will come over personally to help you move out!” ”

The entire Jing fan center was the territory of the financial world.

And the person in charge of the financial world was the highest-ranking executive in the management department.

“If this matter alarmed the management department, the Zhao family would be equivalent to offending the entire financial world. ”

“Although father Zhao had long prepared for the Zhao family to be expelled from the financial world, when this day really came, he was still somewhat unwilling. ”

He had lived in the financial world for more than 40 years and had struggled for more than 40 years. He had originally thought that he would lead the Zhao family to become a noble family.

“He did not expect that in the end, not only did he not become an aristocratic family, he was even expelled from the financial world. ”

“Father Zhao pinched his fingers and looked up at the administrator, using a humble attitude that he had never used in his life, he said, “Mr. Zhao, your surname is Zhao, and my surname is Zhao. Perhaps we were still a family 500 years ago! Can you find an executive officer to make an exception for this matter...” ”

He had no choice but to lower his head.

“No matter what, the Zhao family could not be driven out of the financial world. ”

“The administrator looked at Father Zhao, he said mercilessly, “Don’t try to get close to me. How can a person like you have the right to have the surname Zhao? You have simply insulted this surname! Especially your daughter. She could even kill a cat. Not only does she not have the right to have the surname Zhao, she also doesn’t have the right to be a person!” ”

Father Zhao’s eyes were filled with forbearance.

It was really like a tiger that had fallen to the level of a Ping Yang being bullied by a dog.

“If it was in the past, how would a mere administrator dare to speak to him with such an attitude? ”

“After saying this, the administrator pasted a ‘drive’sign on the Zhao family’s front door. ”

“Father Zhao looked at the administrator’s back view as he left, and his eyes were filled with fury. ”

“However, there was nothing he could do. ” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“According to the current situation, the Zhao family moving out of the financial world was a done deal! ”

“Father Zhao was unwilling, very unwilling. ”

But what could he do if he was unwilling?

“After returning to the house, Father Zhao called the housekeeper and asked him to look for a house. ”

“When the housekeeper heard this, he was also shocked. ”

“Who would have thought that the Zhao family, which was as big as a tree and as thick as a root, would one day become like this! ”

“When Zhao Xueyin returned from the hospital, Father Zhao was already dismissing the servants and preparing to move out of the financial world. ”

Zhao Xueyin was shocked. “Dad! What’s going on? Why Do I see a removal label on our wall?”

“In the past, Zhao Xueyin had only seen this kind of thing in other people’s homes. ”

She did not expect it to happen to her.

Was her family going to be kicked out of the financial world?

“What’s wrong? You still have the face to ask what’s wrong!”Father Zhao was almost unable to contain his anger. “Isn’t this all because of you?”

Zhao Xueyin stumbled back a few steps.

No!

No!

She did not want to leave the financial world.

She did not want to be kicked out of the financial world.

Bang —

Zhao Xueyin’s vision went black and she fainted on the ground.

Father Zhao couldn’t be bothered with her.

“Out of sight, out of mind. He turned around and walked upstairs. It was the maid who helped Zhao Xueyin up from the ground. ”

“It took Zhao Xueyin a long time to wake up, but she still couldn’t accept the fact that the Zhao family was moving out of the financial world. ”

“She had lived in the financial world since she was young, and she would lead the Zhao family to become an aristocratic family in the future! ”

How could she leave the financial world!
