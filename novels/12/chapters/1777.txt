Translator: 549690339

“To Xia Xiaoman and Lin Qingxuan, Ye Zao was their benefactor in this world.”

“If it weren’t for ye Zao, they wouldn’t have had this child at all.”

“Giving the child’s name to Ye Zao was a form of respect and gratitude. They wanted the child to always remember that he came to this world because of his cousin, ye Zao.”

“When drinking water, don’t forget to dig a well.”

“Ye Zao looked at Lin Qingxuan and said, “Fourth uncle, I’ve never given anyone a name before. Are You sure you want me to give it to you?””

“Lin qingxuan smiled and said, “Of course I’m sure. Is this something that can be joked about?””

“”Sure.”Ye Zao Thought for a while and then said, “A refined and refined person. How about little brother’s name is Lin Zhi?””

“”Okay! That’s a good name.”Xia Xiaoman nodded on the bed. “Zao Zao, we’ll use the name you gave us.””

“”Qingxuan, what do you think?”Xia Xiaoman turned to look at Lin Qingxuan.”

“Lin qingxuan smiled and said, “Okay. I also think that Zao Zao is a very good name.””

There was a special feature in the names of the Lin family members.

“In the generation of Ye Zao and Lin Ze, they all had single names, and they all started with Z letters.”

“For example, Lin Ze, Lin Zhuan, Lin Zhu... ... and a few other cousins. Although ye Zhuo did not grow up in the Lin family, her name was still the same as her cousins in the Lin family.”

It also had a letter that began with Z.

Perhaps this was the ancient saying of not being in the same family and not entering the same house.

Lin Zhi.

“Not only did it begin with Z, but it also had the meaning of elegance and elegance.”

This was simply the best of both worlds.

“Hearing this, Xia Xiaoman looked at the sleeping baby beside her and said with a smile, “Lin Zhi, Xiao Lin Zhi, Baby, do you know your name?””

“At this moment, the sleeping baby seemed to have heard Xia Xiaoman’s words. It suddenly opened its eyes and looked at Xia Xiaoman. It even opened its mouth and subconsciously let out an ‘ah’sound.”

“Xia Xiaoman said in surprise, “I understand! He really seems to understand! Qingxuan, look at him quickly.””

“Lin Qingxuan smiled and looked at the baby in the swaddling clothes. He said with a smile, “It seems that the baby really likes the name Sister Searing Scorch gave him. Baby, don’t you think so?””

“AH...”the little guy replied again.

“If the first time was a coincidence, was this time still a coincidence?”

This was too much of a coincidence!

“Seeing this, an Lizi came over and said in surprise, “Oh my God! My Little Brother isn’t a prodigy, is he?””

“”It’s all because of the name burning.”Xia Xiaoman said, “Little brother likes this name, that’s why he’s so happy.””

“”Your mother is right.”Lin Qingxuan smiled and picked up the little guy who had already woken up. “Ah Zhi, ah Zhi! Elegant and pure.”The more he heard this name, the more profound it was.”

“”Oh right, Lizi, searing gave her a big name. You can give her a nickname.””

“”Okay!”An lizi nodded and continued, “How about the baby’s nickname is Doudou?””

“There was a custom in yunjing. A cheap name was easy to raise, especially for an old man like Lin Zhi. If he was careless, he would be taken away by the King of Hell. Only by using a common cheap name could he avoid premature death.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Doudou was usually the name of a pet dog. It was catchy, elegant, and popular. It was the most suitable nickname to use.”

“”Then it’s decided. From now on, our nickname will be Doudou.””

“Throughout the entire process, CEN Shaoqing sat at the side and silently twirled the Buddha beads as if everything around him had nothing to do with him. It was obvious that he had entered a state of selflessness.”

Ye Zhuo gently pushed him.

Cen Shaoqing looked up at her. “What’s Wrong?”

“Aren’t you going to see your little brother?”Ye Zhuo asked.

Little Brother?

“Hearing this, Cen Shaoqing’s expression was subtle.”

“He was already in his thirties and had only four older sisters in his life. Ever since he had gotten to know ye Zhuo, not only had he gained eleven older cousins, he had also gained a younger brother who was not yet a full moon.”

The worst part was that Cen Shaoqing suddenly thought of how he and Ye Zhuo’s child would have to call him little cousin in the future. Cen Shaoqing’s expression became even more subtle!

It was actually his turn to be on equal footing with a newborn child.

Could his seniority be any lower?

“Seeing him like this, ye Zhuo continued, “What are you thinking about?””

Cen Shaoqing stood up from his chair. “I’ll go and take a look now.”He still could not say the word ‘little brother’in the end.

“Cen Shaoqing came to the side of the bed. Lin qingxuan smiled and said, “Doudou, quickly take a look. who came to see you? Quickly call your future brother-in-law.””

“It had only been a day since the child was born. His eyesight had not even developed well, so how could he call him brother-in-law?”

“However, Lin Qingxuan felt that the child would. Perhaps the feeling of having a child at an old age was something that only those who had experienced it would understand.”
