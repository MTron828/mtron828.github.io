It was a feeling that could not be described with words.

Those who did not have the same experience would not be able to empathize.

19 years.

He had waited for a whole 19 years.

There was a document bag in the empty safe.

“Lin Ze quickly took out the document bag, closed the safe door, and came to his room. ”

“Bang, Bang, Bang — ”

“It was only a few steps from Lin Jincheng’s room to his room, but he felt that it was extremely long. Every second felt like he was walking on clouds. ”

It wasn’t real.

It was very unreal.

He never dreamed that he would date Z and open the safe so easily.

“After Lin Ze returned to his room, he immediately locked the doors and windows, closed the curtains, sat in front of his desk, and opened the document bag. ”

“In the document bag, there was a group photo. ”

There was also a letter.

This was a letter that had not been sent in time.

Ashur:

“The letter was beautiful, and the words were like a book. ”

“During this period of time, I have been locked at home by my mother, but don’t worry, I will try to convince my mother as soon as possible, and let her help us. ”

How are you doing in Yunjing? Is the child causing trouble? Is she good? Have you been to the hospital for a checkup? Did you receive the money I sent you?

“Shu, I’m sorry. ”

“When you most need someone to accompany you, I can not accompany you, I am really a husband, a father! ”

“Don’t worry, although I am not with you, but my heart has already flown to the capital, come to you and the child. ”

“I can lose anyone in my life, but I can’t lose you and the child. ”

“I’ve already thought it through. If my mother doesn’t agree to us being together, I’ll take you and the child far away so that they’ll never find us. ”

Please give me a little more time. Don’t Give Up!

I Won’t give up on you either.

...

“These days, I have been recalling the process of our acquaintance. ”

“Bit by bit, like a movie, flashed in front of my eyes. ”

“The greatest luck in my life is to meet you, with our common child. ”

...

Love your sincerity.

August 16th.

“A letter of two pages, about 1,000 words, between the lines are full of Lin Jincheng’s love for his lover and strong helplessness. ”

“His heart was in love with his lover, but unfortunately, his mother at home had been trying to stop him. ”

Only then did Lin ze know.

It turned out that Lin Jincheng was not married at all. He and his mother were pregnant before marriage.

“Then, what happened in the end? ”

Why didn’t Lin Jincheng send the letter?

“Also, Lin Jincheng clearly said in the letter that he would take his mother far away from the capital, so why didn’t he fulfill his promise in the end? ”

Did his mother know of his existence?

“After so many years, why hadn’t his mother come to look for him once? ”

“Also, why did Lin Jincheng write ‘love your sincerity’at the end of the letter? ”

Sincerity?

Cheng?

“The two words had the same pronunciation, but the meaning was very different. ”

“Did Lin Jincheng write the words wrong, or was there something else? ”

Lin Ze had too many questions in his heart.

“Unfortunately, no one could answer them. ”

“After reading the letter, Lin Ze found another photo in the file bag. ”

In the photo.

“The woman was standing next to the young man with a smile on her face. Her facial features were like a painting, and she was smiling very happily. ”

“Behind the photo, there was a row of very beautiful small script. ”

It carried a bit of the gentleness of a woman’s home —

“Seeing a gentleman, Yun Hu did not like it. ”

This is not the character of Lin Jincheng.

Could it be that the person in the photo is his mother?

Yes.

It must be.

She is his mother.

“If this was not his mother, Lin Jincheng would not have kept the photo until now, and would not have put it together with the letter. ”

Nineteen years.

He had waited nineteen years.

Lin Ze just looked at the young and beautiful woman in the photo.

“From a toddler to a babbling toddler, from an unworldly man to a promising young man, he had been thinking of his mother for the past nineteen years. ”

“Suddenly, Lin Ze’s eyes turned red. He pressed the photo tightly to his chest. Tears almost burst out of his eyes. “Mom...” ” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The atmosphere in the room was tense and stifling.

“After a long while, Lin Ze’s emotions slowly calmed down. ”

Now was not the time for him to be sad.

He had to tell Lin Jin Cheng the truth.

He could not let Lin Jin Cheng and Feng Qianhua get engaged.

Lin Ze put the letter and photos in his bag and walked downstairs.

“When he went downstairs, old Mrs. Lin had already taken her lunch break. ”

“Feng Xianxian stood in the hall downstairs, bossing the servants around. ”

She was very imposing.

She looked as if she had become the eldest daughter of the Lin family.

“Seeing Lin ze coming down, Feng Xianxian smiled and walked over to greet him. “Brother Ah Ze.” ”
