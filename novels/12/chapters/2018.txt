On the other side.

“Yi Ling came out from the backpack behind ye Zao, “Da Zao Zao, why did you say that you would bring ye Han back to see Grandma Fei in the future? Ye Han has betrayed you! Don’t you hate betrayal the most?”It was the same as ye Zao, it hated betrayal very much. ”

“”Ye Han didn’t betray me,”Ye Zhuo said. ”

“”He changed his name, but he still didn’t betray you!”Yi Ling looked at her in disbelief. ”

“If this wasn’t betrayal, what was betrayal. ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “He was poisoned by a Gu.” ”

“”Gu?”Yi ling frowned, “What is a Gu?” ”

“”Gu is a mysterious witchcraft on Earth,”ye Zhuo explained, “Many kinds of extremely poisonous insects are placed in a body and sealed. There is no food or water. In this way, they will kill each other. You eat me, I eat you. After one face, there is only one poisonous insect left. This is called Gu. “After a poisonous worm becomes a Gu, its body, shape, and color will all change. If the Gu is planted in a human’s body, the Gu will take root and germinate in the human body, controlling the host’s consciousness, and changing the host’s memories.” ”

“This was also the reason why the last time ye Zhuoyuan looked at Ye Han from afar, Ye Han was like a marionette controlled by someone. ”

“Under normal circumstances, with Ye Han’s skills, it was impossible for a great wizard to plant a Gu on ye Han’s body. ”

“Thinking about it, they must have used the explosion in the laboratory to take advantage of the situation and plant a Gu on ye Han. ”

“Hearing this.., yi Ling said angrily: “This is too terrifying! How could there be such a vicious method in this world! Oh My God! Ye Xiao Han is really too pitiful... ... We have to quickly think of a way to save ye Xiao Han ! Let’s go, great burning, we have to find ye Xiao Han now ! Save Him!” ”

“”We can’t do it now,”ye Zhuo said softly. ”

“Why?”Yi Ling asked.

Ye Zhuo continued: “The most important thing now is to think of a way to remove the Gu from ye Han. Only by removing the GU can we solve the problem.”

The current ye Han was like a chess piece to autumn flute.

“Even if ye Zhuo brought him out from autumn flute’s side, he would still become ye Zhuo’s enemy! ”

Yi Ling asked: “Then how do we undo this Gu?”

“This was also the question that ye Zhuo was most worried about: “The GU that the great witch doctor planted on Ye Han is not an ordinary Gu. If we want to undo the Gu, we must find the purple leaf flower on the Eternal Glacier.” ”

“”Purple Leaf Flower?”Yi ling frowned, “But isn’t the purple leaf flower a legend?” ”

“Ye Zhuo looked into the distance, his red lips pursed tightly. After a moment, he slowly opened his mouth, “The purple leaf flower isn’t a legend. It really exists. However, it blooms for a thousand years and bears fruit for ten thousand years. It’s rarer. That’s why people think that it’s a legendary flower.” ”

“Yi Ling frowned, “But even if the purple leaf flower really exists, we might not be able to find it! What kind of place is the Eternal Glacier? It’s so scorching. Let’s think of another way! Perhaps the purple leaf flower isn’t the only one that can detoxify it?” ”

The Eternal Glacier was a living hell.

“Although it was called a glacier, it was actually the combination of an iceberg and a volcano. ”

“One side of the glacier had a temperature of-200 degrees Celsius, while the other side of the glacier had a temperature of over 300 degrees Celsius! ”

“Because the conditions were too harsh, there was no life on the Eternal Glacier, even the coldest birds of Changyue could not fly on it. ”

“For thousands of years, the Eternal Glacier was silent. ”

“”No,”ye Zhuo continued: “I checked, this Gu can only be solved by the purple leaf flower.” ”

This was also the real reason why ye Zhuo did not look for ye Han after so many days.

“”You are not really thinking of going to the Eternal Glacier to look for the purple leaf flower, are you?”Yi Ling asked. ” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“”No! You Can’t go!”Yi Ling continued, “The Eternal Glacier is too dangerous!” ”

“Ever since the Changyue Kingdom was established, no one had ever set foot on the Eternal Glacier! ”

“Previously, there were also people who didn’t believe it and issued a gimmick to challenge the eternal glacier in order to attract attention. In the end, they died before they could succeed and paid for their ignorance. ”

What Ye Zhuo did was really too risky!

“It’s fine.”Ye Zao’s eyes were indifferent. “You don’t have to worry.”

“Yi Ling flew out and hugged ye Zao’s neck tightly. “In any case, you can’t go!” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Alright, Alright, I won’t go.” ”

“Really?”Yi Ling asked in disbelief.

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Yi Ling continued, “Let’s think of other ways. We can definitely save ye Xiaohan.” ”
