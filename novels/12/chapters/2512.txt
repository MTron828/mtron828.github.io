“Okay.”Zhou Xiang nodded.

“CEN Yueya said, “Then I’ll go back and discuss it with big sister and the others.” ”

Cen Shaoqing was their only younger brother.

“Since Cen Shaoqing was getting married, they naturally couldn’t just sit around and watch the ceremony. ”

Cen Shaoqing would never have thought that his family would have already made the next step after he successfully proposed.

“Mom!”

“At this moment, the sound of footsteps came from outside the door. ”

“It’s the third girl’s voice!”Zhou Xiang stood up from the sofa.

“The door was pushed open from outside. Besides CEN yueying, Cen Yuying was also there. ”

“Cen Yuying saw Cen Yueya and said with a smile, “I told you that the second girl would definitely come, but the third girl didn’t believe it!” ”

“CEN Yueya said, “Big Sister, third girl, why are you here too?” ”

“”Didn’t you see the news of the fifth girl’s proposal?”Cen yueying smiled and said, “But to confirm it, eldest sister and I can’t believe that this is true!” ” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Along the way, watching Cen Shaoqing from deciding not to marry for life to successfully proposing, it felt very surreal. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen looked at the three sisters chatting and laughing, and her expression suddenly looked a little lonely. ”

She sighed lightly.

“Grandma?”Cen yueying noticed that something was wrong with old Mrs. Cen.

Cen Yuying patted CEN yueying and used her eyes to signal her not to ask any more questions.

“Looking at Old Mrs. Cen’s appearance, she knew that she was thinking of Cen Yuyan. ”

“Ever since Cen Yuyan went abroad, she had completely lost all contact with her. ”

“Although she had done many things wrong, she was, after all, someone old Mrs. Cen had watched grow up. At this moment, it was unavoidable for her to be hurt by the scene. ”

“After all, humans were not plants. ”

“Cen Yueying reacted instantly and said, “Grandma, I recently found a very delicious barbecue restaurant. When Zhuozhuo and the fifth girl come back, let’s go eat together, okay?” ”

“Okay.”Old Madam Cen nodded.

The three sisters stayed at home for a long time before returning.

“On the way, Cen Yueya sighed. “I wonder how fourth brother is doing recently? Big Sister, third girl, have any of you contacted fourth brother?” ”

Cen Yuying shook her head. “No.”

“CEN yueying said, “Fourth is the same. She left for such a long time.” ”

“”She made a mistake. It’s normal that she doesn’t have the face to come back,”Cen Yuying continued. “If I were her, I wouldn’t have the face to come back either.” ”

Cen Yuyan had indeed gone overboard back then.

“If it wasn’t for Ye Zhuo, she would have been deceived even more miserably. ”

“CEN yueying sighed. “If she truly repents, it’s not that she can’t Be Forgiven.” ”

Killing someone was just nodding her head.

“After so much time had passed, Cen Yuyan should also know that she was wrong. ”

“”But what if she doesn’t change?”CEN yueying continued, “Fourth brother has been stubborn since he was young. Maybe he still hates us even now.” ”

“Cen Yueying didn’t say anything, and Cen Yuying didn’t say anything either. ”

Because no one was sure if Cen Yuyan had clearly realized her mistake.

“CEN yuying said again, “If she had the heart, she would have come back no matter what if it was someone else who saw the news of young master’s proposal.” ”

“If Cen Yuyan didn’t have the heart, she would pretend that she had never said these words. ”

“Cen Yuying nodded. “Second Lass is right. If she had the heart, she would definitely take this opportunity to come back.” ”

“No matter what, it was the Cen family that raised Cen Yuyan. ”

“If there was no Zhou Xiang, no old lady cen, there would not be CEN Yuyan in this world. ”

“But when Cen Yuyan was confused, Zhou Xiang was more heartbroken than any mother in this world. ”

“As a mother, Zhou Xiang had done her duty. ”

“As the three sisters spoke, they walked forward. ”

Their words were completely swallowed by the night.

The Cen family.

“Zhou Xiang obviously thought of Cen Yuyan as well. She sighed and said, “I wonder how Fourth Lass is doing now?” ”

Old Madam Cen looked at Zhou Xiang. “Do you miss that ingrate?”

“Yes.”Zhou Xiang did not deny it and nodded.

“Old Mrs. Cen snorted lightly and said with a false heart, “Why would I miss her? Even if she dies outside, I won’t miss her!” ”

“After saying this, old Mrs. Cen turned around and walked upstairs. ”

Zhou Xiang looked at Old Mrs. Cen’s voice and shook her head helplessly.

“She knew that the old lady was not saying what she meant, but she did not expose it. ”

On the other side.

Nanhai.

Song Shiyu stood in front of the floor-to-ceiling window. There was an indescribable expression in his eyes as he looked down at the night sky below his feet.

He stood on the highest layer of the Nanhai.
