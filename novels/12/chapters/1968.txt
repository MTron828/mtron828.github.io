He was also anxious.

“However, he was still a man, a husband, and a father. Even if he was anxious, he could only keep it in his heart. ”

Mother he sat down.

“At this moment, Mi Chen came over with food. “Ziteng hasn’t come out yet?” ”

“No.”Mother he shook her head.

“Mi Chen continued, “Uncle, Auntie, Xu Yao, you’ve been waiting here for the whole afternoon. Eat something first. Don’t let your son, ziteng, be fine in a while and you guys fall down First!” ”

“The He family’s parents took the food. “Doctor Mi, you’re too kind.” ”

“”Uncle, Auntie, you’re too polite.”Mi Chen said, “It’s just a small matter. It’s not a big deal.” ”

“Xu Yao’s eyes were red as she said, “I can’t eat now.” ”

“Mother he handed Xu Yao a bowl of porridge. “Even if it’s for the baby in your stomach, you have to eat a little.” ”

“Hearing that, Mi Chen said, “Auntie is right. You’re at the most critical moment right now. Moreover, you had a miscarriage not long ago. If the nutrition can’t keep up, it will be very troublesome later on.” ”

“With that said, Xu Yao was willing to take the porridge. ”

“Time passed by minute by minute, and in the blink of an eye, another two hours had passed. ” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

It had been seven hours since he ziteng had entered the operating theater!

“Mother he paced back and forth anxiously, her heart burning with anxiety. ”

“Mi Chen stood up and said, “Auntie, why don’t I help you ask around?” ”

“”Okay, okay!”Mother he hurriedly nodded. “Then I’ll have to trouble you, Doctor Mi.” ”

“It’s no trouble at all.”

“Mi Chen went to the office of the Vice President, Gu Haitao. ”

“Gu Haitao was working inside. When he saw Mi Chen come in, he immediately stood up and said, “Old MI, why are you here?” ”

“Mi Chen passed a cigarette to Gu Haitao and continued, “How’s The Operating Theater?” ”

“Gu Haitao lit the cigarette. The expression on his face was a little complicated, “The situation isn’t good. I just sent someone in to take a look. There’s a high chance that he ziteng won’t be able to get off the operating table! “Even if he gets off the operating table, I’m afraid he won’t be able to hold on for long! “I heard that Miss Ye doesn’t know any medical skills at all. Many of the medicines were used wrongly!” ”

“Speaking up to this point, Gu Haitao paused for a moment before continuing, “But you mustn’t spread these words. I heard that this miss ye has quite a powerful background. She can’t even offend the director!” ”

“”Don’t worry, I know.”Mi Chen nodded. ”

“In fact, he had long noticed that ye Zao did not know any medical skills at all. ”

“Otherwise, she would not have been unable to diagnose that he had poisoned he ziteng. ”

“Gu Haitao continued, “Even the news of he ziteng’s marriage can not be leaked!” ”

“Okay.”

“After leaving Gu Haitao’s place, Mi Chen arrived at the entrance of the operating theater. ”

“How’s Doctor Mi?”The He family’s parents immediately stood up and looked at Mi Chen.

“Mi Chen said, “I heard that the surgery went quite smoothly. Uncle, Auntie, don’t be anxious. Just wait for the time to come.” ”

“After hearing what Mi Chen said, the he family’s parents heaved a sigh of relief. ”

As long as the surgery went smoothly!

“Xu Yao looked at Mi Chen. “Doctor mi, did the surgery really go very smoothly?” ”

“Mi Chen nodded. “Yes, it went very smoothly.” ”

Xu Yao immediately understood what Mi Chen meant and heaved a sigh of relief.

Another four hours passed.

It was already 10:30 pm at night. It was almost 11 pm!

It had been 11 hours since he ziteng had entered the operating theater!

“Although they had Mi Chen’s consolation, the He family’s parents, who had initially calmed down, were now worried again. ”

Eleven hours.

Would he ziteng be a corpse that couldn’t speak when they saw him again?

Xu Yao also pretended to be very anxious.

She didn’t even eat much for dinner.

“Mother he was worried about he ziteng, but she was also worried about Xu Yao. “Yaoyao, you can’t do this. You have to eat more!” ”

“Xu Yao shook her head. “Auntie, I’m not hungry.” ”

Mother he sighed. “You haven’t eaten much all day. How Can You Not Be Hungry?”

“”I’m really not hungry.”Xu Yao continued, “Auntie, you don’t have to worry about me. If I’m hungry, I’ll eat.” ”

Mother he looked into the operating room. “I don’t know when Ziteng will come out.”

“Xu Yao held mother he’s hand. “Auntie, don’t worry. Ziteng will definitely come out safely.” ”

“”Okay.”Mother he nodded and tried her best to control her emotions so that she wouldn’t cry. “Definitely, definitely!” ”

Da Da —

“At this moment, the sound of footsteps suddenly came from the silent corridor. ”

“Although they only heard the sound and didn’t see the person, it made them feel an inexplicable pressure. ”

The sound of footsteps gradually approached.
