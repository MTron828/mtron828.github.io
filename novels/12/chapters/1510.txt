Translator: 549690339

“What’s going on?”Lin Qingxuan didn’t understand what Yang Wenyin was saying.

“Yang Wenyin continued, “Do you know why fourth sister-in-law hasn’t gotten pregnant yet? Just because your maid, Auntie Sun, gave fourth sister-in-law birth control pills, little twelve caught her red-handed! “Just now, she wanted to destroy the evidence! “Fortunately, little twelve was there, so she didn’t get her way!” ”

“Hearing this, Lin Qingxuan was furious! ”

“No wonder ye Zhuo had diagnosed that Xia Xiaoman had taken birth control pills. He didn’t expect it to be the maid’s doing. Thinking of how Xia Xiaoman trusted Auntie Sun so much and even gave Auntie Sun a raise, Lin Qingxuan now had the heart to kill. ”

Damn it!

It was simply too damn.

“Where is she! Where is Auntie Sun Now?”

“”She is in the living room,”Yang Wenyin said. ”

Lin Qingxuan walked into the living room full of anger.

“Did you drug her?”

“”No, I didn’t! It has nothing to do with me! Mr. Lin, I really didn’t!”Auntie Sun raised her head and looked at Lin Qingxuan. ”

“”Mr. Lin, my mother really didn’t do those things. Please believe her!”Sun Jiayi walked over and cried like a pear blossom in the rain. “She really didn’t do it! My mother wouldn’t do that kind of thing!” ”

This was her last chance!

She had to make use of this opportunity to make Lin Qingxuan pity her.

“”Mr. Lin, please believe us!”At the end, Sun Jiayi subconsciously wanted to reach out and grab Lin Qingxuan’s arm. ”

“She was younger than Xia Xiaoman, prettier than Xia Xiaoman, and more qualified than Xia Xiaoman. ”

There was no reason why Lin Qingxuan couldn’t see her!

“When she became the mistress of the Lin family, she would be ye Zao’s fourth aunt. She must teach ye Zao a good lesson. ”

A junior actually dared to order his elders around.

He had no rules at all!

Lin Qingxuan directly waved away Sun Jiayi’s hand.

“He wasn’t the kind of person who liked young girls. If he was that kind of person, he wouldn’t have chosen Xia Xiaoman when he divorced Zhao shuning. ”

“With his conditions, it was not difficult to find an unmarried girl. ”

“Sun Jiayi was flung to the ground, and intense pain came from her body. ”

She could not believe it.

“She had thought that Lin Qingxuan would definitely take care of her, but she did not expect Lin Qingxuan to directly throw her away without any mercy. ”

“Seeing Sun Jiayi being flung to the ground, Auntie Sun quickly ran over to help her up. “Jiayi, are you okay?” ”

“Mom!”Sun Jiayi was like a child who had been wronged. She hugged auntie sun and cried incessantly.

“Lin Qingxuan was annoyed by the mother and daughter’s crying. Thinking about what the mother and daughter had done, she was so angry that she raised her hand and was about to slap someone. ”

“Seeing her like this, Xia Xiaoman quickly stopped him. “Qingxuan, calm down. Zhuozhuo has already asked the butler to call the police. We’ll wait for the police to come!” ”

“Auntie Sun and Sun Jiayi were a perfect mother and daughter. If Lin Qingxuan were to hit someone, it would be hard to explain. ”

“For Xia Xiaoman’s sake, Lin Qingxuan didn’t do anything. ”

“The police came very quickly. After understanding the situation, they searched Auntie Sun’s maid’s room and found a bag of white powder in the maid’s drawer. Then, the police retrieved the surveillance camera and took the bowl of medicine with them to collect evidence. ”

Auntie Sun felt that everything was so unreal until she got into the police car.

“Xia Xiaoman had not discovered anything for a year, but ye Zhuo had discovered it at such a critical time. ”

Auntie Sun was very regretful now!

“She regretted not underestimating ye Zhuo, and even more regretting not steadying her thoughts. After all, she did not plan to put anything in the medicine in the first place. ”

“This was all Sun Jiayi’s fault. If it were not for Sun Jiayi, things would not have turned out this way. ”

“Not to mention that Auntie Sun was regretful, Sun Jiayi was also very regretful. If time could be reversed, she would not have underestimated her enemy. ”

“But now, what was the use of saying that she was regretful! ”

Auntie Sun and Sun Jiayi were only begging now. The bowl of medicine would not be able to detect anything. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Once the pill was found, they would be done for! ”

The car soon arrived at the police station.

“During the interrogation, Auntie Sun insisted that she didn’t put anything in the pill. ”

“It had been a few hours, but there was still no news from the pill. Maybe it couldn’t be found at all. ”

“At this moment, there was a knock on the door of the interrogation room. ”

The police officer in charge of the interrogation went to open the door.

“”Captain Zhou, the test report is out.” ”

It was the intern Xiao Wu who came outside.

“Captain Zhou asked, “What’s the result?” ”

“Xiao Wu handed the test report to Captain Zhou, “The test report shows that the victim, Xia Xiaoman, did indeed have the ingredients of the contraceptive pill in her medicine. Moreover, not only does this medicine have an infertility effect, if taken for a long time, it will also cause a certain amount of harm to the human body. If taken for a long time, it will even endanger the life of the victim!” ”
