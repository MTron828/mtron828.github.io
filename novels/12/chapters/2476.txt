“However, song Shiyu trusted him very much! ”

“That kind of trust was deeply engraved in his heart. Until now, he was extremely grateful to Song Shiyu. ”

“If it wasn’t for Song Shiyu back then, he wouldn’t be the current him. ”

“Old Master Zhao looked at Jin Yuan, feeling a little complicated. “Lawyer Jin, may I ask, what is third master song’s current attitude?” ”

“In fact, grandfather Zhao was also very uneasy. ”

“After all, Song Shiyu was not like this in the past. ”

“Just three months ago, song Shiyu had helped the Chen family settle a rather big matter. ”

How long had it been?

How could he be so ruthless to the Chen Family?

“Jin Yuan adjusted his spectacles, then, he said, “Grandfather Zhao, please rest assured. Boss song is a good man. He will definitely handle the matter from a fair and just perspective. You and Mr. Zhao are the victims now. As a lawyer, I will make Chen Youlong pay the price he deserves.” ”

“At this moment, Jin Yuan’s entire body emitted a light of justice. ”

A Good Man?

Song Shiyu was a good man?

This was probably the most unreliable thing that old master Zhao had heard in the past ten years.

“Although song Shiyu had not done any evil deeds, he was definitely not a good man. ”

“As long as he was a good man, the head of the song family would not fall on song Shiyu’s head. ”

“Grandfather Zhao smiled and said, “Lawyer Jin and third master song are old friends...” ”

“At this point, grandfather Zhao paused and continued, “Can you tell me what happened between the song family and the Chen Family? Don’t make things worse...”the song family and the Chen family had reconciled, if the clown became him, then the loss would outweigh the gain! ”

“After all, the song family was really powerful in Yun Jing. ”

“Jin Yuan didn’t say anything more. He adjusted his glasses and said, “Elder Zhao, Boss song is definitely not the kind of person who would go back on his words and be indecisive. He must have his own reasons for doing so. You just have to cooperate.” ”

“Hearing this, elder Chen had a plan in mind. He continued, “Alright, then we’ll Do as you say, lawyer Jin. We’ll cooperate with you.” ”

“Okay.”Jin Yuan took a sip of tea and stood up from his chair. “That’s settled then. I’ll go back first. The two of you just wait for my news.”

“Okay.”Old Master Zhao stood up to send Jin Yuan off.

Zhao Liu also immediately followed the two of them.

“Walking out of the door, Jin Yuan stopped and turned to look at Old Master Zhao. “Old Master Zhao, please wait a moment.” ”

“Old Master Zhao stopped in his tracks. “Take care, lawyer Jin. I’ll leave this matter to you. If there’s anything that you need us to cooperate with, just contact us.” ”

“Okay.”Jin Yuan nodded.

“Looking at Jin Yuan’s back, Zhao Liu asked curiously, “Dad, do you think we’re Dreaming?” ”

“Even if it was a dream, it wouldn’t be so ridiculous! ”

“Grandfather Zhao looked in the direction where the car had disappeared and said, “It seems that the Chen family has offended third master song badly this time!” ”

“If not, song Shiyu would never have done this. ”

“Then isn’t our family Lucky?”Zhao Liu said with a smile.

“If the Chen family lost the Big Tree That Song Shiyu had, it was only a matter of time before they were killed. ”

“Over the years, the Chen family had offended countless people because of song Shiyu! ”

Old Master Zhao did not say anything. “Is Siliang back yet?”

Zhao Siliang was Zhao Liu’s son.

“Unlike Zhao Liu’s father, Zhao Siliang was extremely capable. He stayed abroad for ten years and did business with the Dutch for eight years. He had accumulated a lot of business talent. ”

“Zhao Liu continued, “Not yet. He said he’ll be back the day after tomorrow.” ”

Old Master Zhao nodded.

The father and son walked towards the hall.

“”Dad, AH Liu.” ”

The two of them had just walked into the hall when they saw a beautiful young woman walk out.

The young woman looked to be about twenty-five or twenty-six years old.

“She was very beautiful. Her appearance was decent, but her demeanor exuded a worldly aura. ”

“This was the wife that Zhao Liuxin had married, Liu Jing. ”

“Liu Jing was someone that Zhao Liu had met in the nightclub. He was 32 years younger than Zhao Liuxiang, and because of this, old master Zhao had disapproved of these two people from the start. ”

“However, Zhao Liu had always wanted to die, so old master Zhao could only grit his teeth and agree. ”

It turned out that old master Zhao’s judgment was not wrong.

“On the first day that Liu Jing entered the room, she caused trouble. ”

“Seeing Liu Jing, old master Zhao frowned slightly and walked past Liu Jing as if he did not see her. ”

“Liu Jing saw the disdain in old master Zhao’s eyes, and her eyes were full of depression. ”

She knew that old master Zhao had always looked down on her birth.

“Zhao Liu was also a womanizer. She did not know how many people she had offended before, and she did not know how long she could be Mrs. Zhao. Thinking of this, the depression in Liu Jing’s eyes became even more obvious. ”
