“”Young Master Yu, we’re here.” ”

Xian ‘er tilted her head and looked at Yu senility. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Yu senility was leaning against the car window, taking a nap. When he heard the sound, he immediately opened his eyes. “Are we here?” ”

“”Yes.”Xian ‘er nodded and continued, “Cen Wuye and Miss Ye don’t seem to have arrived yet.” ”

This answer was within the expectations of senility.

Only 20 minutes had passed.

Ye Zhuo was probably still on his way.

It would be strange if she could make it.

“Where are we waiting for Miss Ye?”Xian ‘er continued to ask.

“Wait.”

Yu sunset took out his phone and called Cen Shaoqing.

The other side answered very quickly.

“Zixu.”

Cen Shaoqing’s tone was indifferent. “What’s Wrong?”

“How much longer do you have?”Yu sunset asked.

Cen Shaoqing’s tone was low. “Look behind.”

Look behind?

Where was behind?

Yu Jiuqing was stunned for a moment before turning back to look.

“When he saw this, he was immediately stunned. ”

“Cen Shaoqing and ye Zhuo were already sitting in the beverage shop at the back, drinking their drinks. ”

“When he saw this scene, Yu Jiuqing’s eyes instantly widened. ”

“He put down his phone and jogged over. “Zixu, when did you guys arrive?” ”

“Ten minutes ago.”Cen Shaoqing’s tone was flat.

Ten minutes ago?

“In other words, Cen Shaoqing and ye Zao only took twelve minutes to arrive? ”

How was this possible!

“You guys arrived ten minutes ago?”Yu Xiannian asked in disbelief.

“En.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Xian ‘er also walked over at this time and said in surprise, “So the car we saw on the road just now was really Miss Ye!” ”

Oh My God!

This was too scary!

Xian ‘er never thought that the person she met on the road just now was really ye Zao!

“”Miss Ye, you really don’t show your true colors!”Xian ‘er looked at ye Zao. ”

Ye Zao smiled faintly. “Thank you for the compliment.”

“”Miss Ye, are you in the racing circle?”Xian ‘er asked. ”

“”I’ve participated in a race before,”ye Zao answered. ”

Xian ‘er looked at ye Zao with admiration in her eyes. “Which race was it from?”

“As a member of the racing circle, she had paid attention to every race. ”

Ye Zao Thought for a moment. “I think it was from the 56th race.”

The 56th race

“Xian ‘er thought about the champion of the 56th race and stared at ye Zao with wide eyes. Her eyes were filled with disbelief. “Oh my God, Miss Ye! You Can’t be God Ye, right?” ”

God Ye was known as God Ye because he was simply the pinnacle of the racing world.

“Unfortunately, God Ye had not participated in a racing competition for a long time. ”

Ye Zhuo smiled faintly. “It’s me.”

“”Ahhh!”Xian ‘er was so excited that she almost jumped up. “God Ye, I’ve finally seen you in person! Do you know how much I admire you?” ”

God Ye was simply Xian ‘er’s idol.

Her biggest wish was to become a racing driver like God Ye.

“She did not expect that in her lifetime, she would actually be able to see God Ye in person! ”

“”Thank you for liking it,”ye Zhuo said with a smile. ”

“At this moment, Xian ‘er had completely transformed into a little fangirl. ”

“”God Ye, why did you not participate in the car race later?”Xian ‘er continued to ask. ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Car racing is just a hobby of mine.” ”

Yu sunset stood at the side and watched this scene. He was completely speechless.

“One dared to believe it, and the other dared to admit it. ”

“Xian ‘er usually looked like a very smart girl, but how did she become like this? ”

Like an idiot.

Yu Sunset’s eyes were filled with ridicule.

He was becoming more and more suspicious of Cen Shaoqing’s taste.

How could he fall for such a vain girl!

How terrifying.

“Zixu.”Yu sunset walked in front of Cen Shaoqing and whispered.

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing looked up at Yu sunset.

“Yu sunset continued, “Did you drive the car just now?” ”

That’s right.

Yu sunset was starting to suspect who was driving the car.

“He had known Cen Shaoqing for many years, so he naturally knew Cen Shaoqing’s driving skills. ”

Cen Shaoqing was at the top of the world in the racing circle with that God ye who never showed up.

That fatal turn just now was like playing with Cen Shaoqing.

“So, it was definitely Cen Shaoqing! ”

But what Yu Xiannian did not expect was that CEN Shaoqing would actually go to such an extent for a girl to give to a child.

One had to know that Cen Shaoqing used to hate lying the most.

But now...

No wonder the Ancients said that women were trouble.

It was not easy to turn Cen Shaoqing into this state.

What kind of girl was ye Zhuo?
