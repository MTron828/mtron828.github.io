“Wei Wei had already thought of all the funeral arrangements. She continued, “Sister Ye, Uncle Director, I know that all of you are doing this for my own good. However, I really don’t want to have the surgery anymore. You guys can go out. I’m tired and I want to rest.” ”

“The director wanted to say something more, but ye Zhuo used his eyes to signal that he did not need to say anything more. He looked at Wei Wei and continued, “Wei Wei, the opportunity now is in your hands. You have to think it through carefully.” ”

“After saying that, ye Zao turned to look at the hospital director. “Hospital director Han, let Weiwei have a good rest. Let’s go.” ”

Hospital director Han stood up and followed ye Zao’s footsteps.

“After walking out of the ward, hospital director Han scratched his head. “I don’t know what Old Wang said to Weiwei! I’m really anxious!” ”

“”We’ve said what we should say. We’ll do our best and leave it to fate,”ye Zao said. ”

“Since ancient times, the relationship between doctors and patients had been very tense. Now that patients were not willing to operate, doctors could not force them to do so, ”

“”Oh right, Miss Ye.”Director Han seemed to have suddenly thought of something and continued, “Wang Dajun even told the media about this matter. The outside world is probably turning upside down by now.” ”

“Ye Zao was a walking hot topic. Once this news was released, it would be difficult for people not to pay attention to it. ”

On the other side.

Doctor Wang was already in an interview.

He stood in front of the camera and narrated the entire process word by word. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“”Three months ago, our hospital received a strange patient.. ”

“”After Miss Ye’s diagnosis, I learned that the patient was suffering from malaria. However, I discovered that the patient’s condition was very different from malaria, so I gave the patient a new examination. The examination results showed that the patient’s condition had nothing to do with malaria at all... “... ” ”

“At this point, Dr. Wang took out a diagnosis document. ”

“Whoosh, Whoosh, Whoosh. ”

Countless cameras aimed at the diagnosis document.

“”After my research, I found out that the patient did not have malaria at all. Instead, it was the very rare Moz virus. This virus only appeared in the 1970s. In addition, I’ve already confirmed the diagnosis plan...” ”

“Doctor Wang was fully prepared. He was very confident in front of the camera. His logic was clear, and his thinking was orderly. ”

“Towards the end.., doctor Wang continued, “I know that many of the audience may think that I’m an idiot at this moment. After all, the person standing in front of Me is Miracle Doctor Ye, who once cured cancer. And I, I’m just a nobody. A person like me can not be compared to Miss Ye. “However, there is no such thing as a nobody. A nobody has its own uses. Therefore, after thinking for a long time, I decided to publicize this matter to the public.” ”

“As soon as this interview video was posted, it was shared and liked by many people. ”

“[ how should I put it? Miracle Doctor Ye is Miracle Doctor Ye after all. She is a character who created a myth. In comparison, I still prefer to believe in Miracle Doctor Ye! ] ”

“[ back then, my husband had terminal stomach cancer. He even wrote a suicide note. But at this time, Miracle Doctor Ye appeared. It was she who gave our family hope. It was also she who gave our family happiness. From then on, Miracle Doctor Ye was the benefactor of our family. ] ”

“-LMiracleaDoctorcYer ye’s achievements can not be ignorHoweverever, there is something tDr. Wangwang said in the video that is very trBeforefMiracleaDoctorcYer ye became a miracle doctor, he was just an ordinary studeAt. at that time, how many people did not believeMiracleaDoctorcYer ye? ]? I feel that the current doctor Wang is the Miracle Doctor Ye at that time. We can not be blinded by one person’s achievements and not see the right things. ] ”

“[ a gentleman does not speak like a man, and a gentleman does not speak nonsense like a man. This time, I am also on doctor Wang’s side. After all, people are not saints. Although Miracle Doctor Ye is amazing, it is impossible for him to not make a single mistake. ] ”

[ ... ]

“For a time, there was endless debate on the internet. ”

“Some people believed in ye Zao, and naturally, there were also people who stood by Doctor Wang. ”

Director Han had a headache. How could he have thought that things would develop to this stage.

“Now, as soon as he stepped out of the door, he would be surrounded by countless reporters. ”

Ye Zao was still the best.

“After all, Ye Zao had never appeared in front of any media as a miracle doctor. Everyone only knew the name of Miracle Doctor Ye, but they had never seen Miracle Doctor Ye himself. ”

“At night, Doctor Wang came to Weiwei’s ward. ”

“”Weiwei, I have already confirmed the treatment plan for you. Take a look.”After he said that, doctor Wang handed the plan to Weiwei. ”

Weiwei reached out and took it.

“A moment later, doctor Wang handed Weiwei a pre-operation dangerous notice. “Weiwei, sign it. We can arrange the surgery tomorrow and the day after tomorrow.” ”
