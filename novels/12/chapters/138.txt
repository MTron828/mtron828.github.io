Chapter 139: 083: Great Abuse, great love! Great Motherly Love 5

“Mom!”Ye Zao hugged ye Shu.

Being hugged by her daughter, Ye Shu could not help but cry.

Not long after, an ambulance arrived.

When they arrived at the hospital, Ye Shu was pushed to the emergency room.

Because the severed finger was handled very well, the Doctor said that it could be reattached.

Hearing this, Ye Zao breathed a sigh of relief. He told the doctor that as long as he could keep the finger, it did not matter how much it cost.

When Ye Sen arrived, Ye Shu was still in the emergency room.

“Zao Zao, what’s Going On? Why is your mother’s finger broken?”

Ye Zao’s eyes were still slightly red as he recounted what had happened.

Hearing this, Ye Sen’s entire body was trembling.

The veins on his face bulged!

It was as if he had become a completely different person.

It was extremely unfamiliar!

He turned around and walked out of the door. “Damn it! I’m going to kill them now!”

It was said that elder sisters were like mothers.

This sentence was very suitable for ye Sen and Ye Shu.

Although ye Shu was not the elder sister, she was more responsible than ye Shuang, the elder sister.

If it was not for ye Shu, Ye Sen would have died when he was very young!

Therefore, Ye Sen had always respected ye Shu!

“Uncle! Don’t be rash! Calm down!”Ye Zao pulled ye Sen back, “My mother has already lost a finger, she definitely doesn’t want anything to happen to you! Killing someone to pay with your life, for the sake of such a family, it’s not worth it to sacrifice yourself!”

“Let go of me!”

“Uncle!”Ye Zao continued, “Don’t worry, I Won’t let my mother lose a finger for nothing!”

She would make them pay back a hundred times over!

“Zao Zao?”Ye Sen looked at Ye Zao.

Ye Zao nodded.

At this moment, the lights in the emergency room were turned off.

The door was pushed open from the inside.

Ye Zao and Ye Sen quickly went up to welcome the doctor. “Doctor, how is my mother (my sister) ?”

The Doctor took off his mask and smiled. “Don’t worry, the surgery went smoothly! The severed finger has been reattached, but you must pay attention to recuperation during this period of time! Stay in the hospital for observation for three days!”

“Okay, thank you, doctor!”

Then, Ye Shu was pushed out from inside.

“Mom!”

“Sis!”

Ye Shu’s condition was not bad, but her face was very pale. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Ten fingers connected to the heart.

She said that it did not hurt, but that was a lie.

She did not want ye Zhuo to worry.

“Don’t worry, I’m Fine!”Ye Shu’s lips curled up into a pale smile, “Ye Sen, you’re not allowed to do anything stupid! After what happened today, they won’t dare to come and make trouble again! I want you all to be fine! Live a peaceful life!”

They were brother and sister.

Ye Shu knew Yesen too well.

She knew that Yesen would definitely not let it go.

“Sister!”

“If you still treat me as your sister, then listen to me! Otherwise, don’t call me your sister anymore!”Ye Shu said very seriously, there was no hint of a joke in her eyes.

She broke a finger so that her family could live a peaceful life.

If ye Sen did something else...

Then wouldn’t she have lost a finger for nothing?

After a long while, Ye Sen nodded. “I understand, Sister.”

“And you.”Ye Shu turned to look at ye Zao. “Zao Zao, I know you’re not an ordinary child, but this matter has passed. Let’s Let It Pass! Don’t be stupid!”

Ye Zao’s eyes were serious. “Don’t worry, Mom. I Won’t do anything risky for that group of disgusting people! They’re not worth it!”

Ye Shu smiled and nodded. “This is my good daughter.”

At two in the afternoon.

Ye Sen asked ye Zao to accompany Ye Shu at the hospital. He would go back and make some tonic soup to bring over. Ye Shu had lost so much blood, so she needed to be well-nourished.

Ye Zao stood up and said, “Uncle, you stay in the hospital to accompany my mother. I’ll go back and get my computer.”

“You can all go home!”Ye Shu sat up from the hospital bed. “I just can’t move a finger. It’s not like I’m paralyzed. I don’t need you to take care of me!”

Ye Sen acted as if he didn’t hear ye Shu’s words and patted ye Zao’s shoulder. “Zao Zao, then you can go back. Be careful on the way home.”

“I know.”

Ye Zao left the ward.

Seeing the big and small pair ignoring her directly, ye Shu sighed, “I’m serious. I really don’t need anyone to accompany me! Ye Sen, you should go back too! Didn’t you say that the company has been quite busy recently? Hurry up and go back to work! Don’t delay the company’s matters because of me!”

The Express Delivery Company was open all year round.

Even on the thirtieth of the year, they had to deliver the goods.

Today was already the third day of the first month.

“I’m not busy.”Ye Sen sat down and peeled an apple for ye Shu. “I’ve already explained everything when I came. Sister, you don’t have to worry.”
