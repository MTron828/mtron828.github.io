“Seeing Feng Qianhua being so reasonable and blaming all the mistakes on Feng Xianxian, Old Mrs. Lin felt very guilty. ”

She thought that she had taught Lin ze well.

“This time, she took the college entrance examination and was the top scholar in the Arts in Beijing. In front of everyone, she had won her favor. ”

It was a pity.

That was all superficial.

This child’s upbringing was far inferior to Feng Xianxian’s.

“In front of Feng Xianxian, other than his academic results being a little better, Lin Ze was inferior to Feng Xianxian in all other aspects. ”

Old Madam Lin only regretted that she had not given the infant Lin ze to Feng Qianhua to feed.

“But now, what was the use of regretting? ”

“Old Mrs. Lin Sighed. “I spoiled ah ze! It has nothing to do with Xianxian. Qianhua, don’t blame the Child!” ”

“Feng Qianhua smiled and said, “Ah Ze has been sensible since he was young. He’s nothing like Xianxian! Crazy Girl!” ”

Feng Xianxian pouted to express her dissatisfaction.

“Old Mrs. Lin hugged Feng Xianxian and said, “Our Xianxian is not a crazy girl!” ”

“Feng Xianxian’s face was full of smiles, but her heart was filled with disgust. ”

“This damn old woman, if it wasn’t for the Lin family’s influence in the capital, who would be willing to be her granddaughter? ”

“After a while, old lady lin continued, “Qianhua, the weather will be fine tomorrow. Go back and ask your mother to come over. We haven’t seen each other for a long time.” ”

“”Okay.”Feng Qianhua nodded. She took out the health-preserving soup from the thermos bucket and handed it to Old Mrs. Lin. “Aunt Lin, Drink the soup first.” ”

Old Mrs. Lin took the bowl and drank a mouthful of the soup.

“As it was health-preserving soup, it had a faint smell of Chinese medicine. Fortunately, the smell of the medicine was not particularly strong. After a mouthful, she felt refreshed and her breathing was smooth. ”

Old Madam Lin felt very comfortable.

“Only Feng Qianhua was filial. If it were anyone else, would they be able to deliver soup to her day after day for ten years? ”

“If not for this bowl of health-preserving soup, she would have died long ago. ”

It was not until the afternoon that Feng Qianhua and her daughter left.

Aunt Zhang sent them out.

“Walking out of the manor, Feng Qianhua said, “Aunt Zhang, you should go back quickly.” ”

“Aunt Zhang turned around and looked inside. “Miss Qianhua, there’s something that I haven’t had the time to tell you.” ”

“”Go ahead,”Feng Qianhua said. ”

“Aunt Zhang lowered her voice and said, “Didn’t I go back to my hometown some time ago? After I came back, I heard that Lin Ze went to Yun Jing for ten days.” ”

“When she heard the words ‘Yun Jing’, a hint of ruthlessness appeared in Feng Qianhua’s eyes. ” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

What was that little bastard doing in Yun Jing?

He must be looking for ye Shu!

A bastard was a bastard.

She was so good to him!

But this bastard seemed to have no eyes.

He didn’t know what was good for him!

“Aunt Zhang continued, “But don’t worry. He didn’t seem to have found anything in Yun Jing.”If Lin Ze had found something, he wouldn’t be so calm. ”

“Feng Qianhua frowned. “Please keep an eye on Aunt Lin. Don’t let her say anything in front of the Little Bastard.”Feng Qianhua was a smart person. She knew that the reason why Lin Ze couldn’t find ye Shu.., was because Lin Ze didn’t know anything about ye Shu. ”

Once Lin Ze found ye Shu...

The consequences would be unimaginable.

Aunt Zhang also knew the severity of this matter. “Don’t worry with me around.”

Feng Qianhua nodded. “Then I’ll have to trouble you.”

“”It’s my duty,”aunt Zhang continued, “It’s rush hour now. Drive slowly when you go back.” ”

“”I know.”Feng Qianhua looked at Feng Qianxian. “Qianxian, quickly say goodbye to your Grandma Zhang.” ”

Feng Qianxian was a little unwilling.

It was fine if she had to curry favor with that old woman from the Lin family and Lin Ze.

But what was Aunt Zhang?

She was just a servant of the Lin family.

Asking her to call a servant grandmother?

What was this?

“Seeing that Feng Qianqian had no reaction, Feng Qianhua raised her voice and said coldly, “Are you deaf? Quickly say goodbye to your grandmother Zhang!” ”

“Aunt Zhang smiled and said, “It’s fine, it’s fine. Why are you arguing with a child? Quickly go back! It’s getting late.” ”

“Feng Xianxian!”

“Feng Xianxian bit her lip and said unwillingly, “Goodbye, Grandma Zhang.” ”

Only then was Feng Qianhua satisfied.

“Feng Qianhua lowered her head and looked at Aunt Zhang. “Aunt Zhang, we’ll go back first.” ”

“Let’s go back.”Aunt Zhang nodded and watched Feng Qianhua and her daughter get into the car.

Only when the red car disappeared into the road did aunt Zhang turn around and leave.

In the car.

“Feng Qianxian asked curiously, “Mother, is Lin Ze’s mother in Yunjing?” ”

“”This isn’t a question you should be asking.”Feng Qianhua’s expression was a little ugly as she continued, “Qianxian, I’ve told you many times not to be so rude to your grandma Zhang!” ”
