“A moment later, Bai Jingshu said, “No.” ”

“In any case, a child had to be born sooner or later, so there was no need to take any measures. ”

“Ye Zao smiled. “Alright, I’ll tell my parents to prepare themselves mentally.” ”

“At that moment, ye Zao’s phone rang. ”

“Ye Zao picked up the call and his expression changed slightly. “Alright, I’ll be right there.” ”

“After hanging up the phone, Ye Zhuo turned to look at Bai Jingshu. “Sister-in-law, there’s something I need to go to the base right away.” ”

Bai Jingshu nodded. “Then hurry up and go! Don’t delay the important matters!”

“”Okay.”Ye Zhuo put away his phone and continued, “Help me tell mom and Dad That I won’t be home for dinner later.” ”

“Okay.”

Ye Zao jogged all the way to the parking lot.

“Her driving skills were very good. In addition, a lot of things had happened at the base. It would have taken her half an hour to get there in ten minutes. ” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“After a burst of brakes, the car stopped steadily at the entrance of the base. ”

“In a moment, the car door opened and a slender figure leaned out of the car. It was against the light, so her face could not be seen clearly. ”

Ye Zhuo had just gotten out of the car when another Black Land Rover stopped.

“A few seconds later, Cen Shaoqing walked out of the car. ”

“Leader.”

Ye Zhuo looked at Cen Shaoqing. “You received a call too?”

“When he received the call, Cen Shaoqing was setting up the marriage proposal venue. He did not want to come, but something had indeed happened that he had to come. ”

“En.”Cen Shaoqing caught up with Ye Zhuo’s footsteps. “Let’s go in and take a look first.”

Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“After entering the base, the two of them changed into their lab coats and walked into the lab. ”

“Before they entered, they saw a group of people in lab coats discussing among themselves. ”

“When they saw the two of them enter, they immediately made way for them. ”

“”Miss Ye, master five!” ”

“What’s going on?”Ye Zao asked.

“Dr. Zhang immediately stood up, “It’s like this. We’ve detected single-celled organisms from the alien debris sent from L continent. The most incredible thing is that in just three days, these single-celled organisms have already evolved into multi-celled organisms, and they’re still evolving at a speed visible to the naked eye! “We’re worried that if this continues, things will turn out to be out of our control!” ”

Extraterrestrial life was full of danger. No one knew what these things would evolve into.

What if they were the nemesis of mankind?

“Tens of thousands of years ago, dinosaurs could go extinct once, so it was very likely that mankind would go extinct again. ”

“Hearing this, Ye Zhuo frowned without leaving a trace. “Where are the things?” ”

“Here.”Dr. Zhang immediately led ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing to the laboratory table.

“These single-celled organisms could only be observed with a microscope, but now, even without a microscope, they could still be seen. ”

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Immediately inform the LZHOU scientific research base to stop the research and destroy these things immediately!” ”

“Dr. Zhang’s prediction was right. If these organisms continued to evolve, the situation would become uncontrollable. ”

They had to be destroyed immediately.

“Ye Zao looked at these things with an unpleasant expression. He added, “Use potassium carbonate to destroy them.” ”

“Okay.”

“Soon, these alien creatures were destroyed. ”

“Ye Zao was still worried, so he personally went to check them. ”

He only heaved a sigh of relief after he confirmed that there were no problems.

“Seeing ye Zao like this, professor Zhang continued, “Miss Ye, are these creatures scary?” ”

“Ye Zao’s red lips parted slightly, “If we don’t stop them, this will be a disaster for China and the whole world.” ”

“It’s that serious?”Professor Zhang was a little surprised.

“He had expected that these creatures were not simple, but he did not expect the consequences to be so serious. ”

“Ye Zao nodded slightly, “Professor Zhang, it’s a good thing that you discovered it early and reported it in time.” ”

“Professor Zhang continued, “The growth rate of these alien creatures is too terrifying, that’s why I feel that something is wrong. I’m going to check if LZHOU has received any notice and ask them to quickly destroy it!” ”

“”Go,”ye Zao said. ”

Professor Zhang immediately walked out.

Lzhou.

Research base.

“The person in charge of the base was sitting in his office, listening to the report from his assistant. He raised his eyes slightly and continued, “This is from China?” ”

“”Yes, Mr. Mario.” ”

“Mario turned the thumb ring on his index finger and narrowed his eyes, “The Chinese have always had a lot of thoughts, especially that YC.” ”
