Translator: 549690339

“Zhou Zi Yue nodded. “Don’t worry, Mom. I know.””

Zhou Zi Yue was very much like ye Sui.

“She had always been very good at supporting ye Shuang’s smelly feet, and she was even better at supporting ye Shuang’s two daughters.”

“Speaking up to this point, Zhou Zi Yue continued, “Mom, what if Little Aunt Doesn’t like me?””

“After all, she did not have a good relationship with ye Shu in the past.”

“Zhou ziyue sighed, “If we knew that Aunty would end up like this, we should have treated aunty well then.””

“”Look at Lin Sha’s house! If it wasn’t for my Aunty, would Lin Weiwei be able to do business? Would Lin Sha be able to study abroad?””

“Hearing this, Ye Sui was also very regretful.”

“If she had known this would happen, she definitely wouldn’t have mocked ye Shu back then.”

“Otherwise, she would be the one enjoying life with ye Shu now! How could Zhou Yuelian have the right to speak!”

“Ye Sui sighed and continued, “Who knows the past and the future!””

“”But Ziyue, don’t worry. I’m your aunt’s biological sister. She has cut off relations with your grandmother and uncles now. If she sees me, she will definitely be very happy.””

Zhou Ziyue was still a little worried.

“After all, ye Sui had done a lot of bad things to Ye Shu in order to please ye Shuang in the past. Including a junior like Zhou Ziyue, he had mocked and ridiculed ye Shu before.”

Zhou Ziyue did not say anything.

“Ye Sui continued, “Actually, when your aunt dated that Lin Qingcheng, I could already feel that Lin Qingcheng was not a simple person! “Your Aunt’s life is still the best. Although she has lived through 18 years of hardship, she is finally happy after suffering!””

“Ye Sui used to look down on Ye Shu, but now he was envious of her.”

“After saying that, ye Sui reminded Zhou ziyue, “Ziyue, remember to perform well. I heard that on your aunt’s side, other than ye Zhuo, all the brothers of the Lin family have sons. They don’t have any daughters!””

“Although Zhou Ziyue graduated from an ordinary secondary school, she was good-looking and well-behaved. If Ye Shu was willing to set her up, Zhou Ziyue would definitely marry into the Lin family!”

“In this way, Zhou Ziyue would be a rich lady from a wealthy family in the future!”

“The more ye Sui thought about it, the more excited he became.”

Zhou Ziyue also thought of this and nodded. “Okay.”

“At this moment, Zhou Ziyue seemed to have thought of something and asked, “How is Ye Zhuo Now?””

“Zhou Ziyue had only met ye Zao once. At that time, the rumors about ye Zao were not good, so she did not pay much attention to ye Zao.”

“Although there had been a lot of news about ye Zao in recent years, Zhou Ziyue did not know that the famous Miss Ye in China was ye Zao.”

“Ye Sui was the same as Zhou Ziyue. She only knew that ye Zao was not very smart, so she did not know anything else.”

“”Ye Zao is just an idiot. You Don’t have to pay attention to her,”ye Sui said.”

Ye Sui’s memory of Ye Zao was still stuck on the fact that ye Zao was an idiot who could not even recognize a man.

“Okay.”Zhou Ziyue nodded.

“As the mother and daughter spoke, they left the station and took a taxi to the address of the Lin family manor.”

“When the driver heard that it was the famous wealthy nest, he smiled and said, “Are the two of you here to visit relatives?””

“Yes.”Ye Sui nodded.

“The driver then asked, “Big sister, do your relatives work at North Ring Road?””

“”No.”Ye Sui smiled and said, “My sister lives here. By the way, master, are the people who live here all very rich?””

“When the driver heard this, he was immediately amused. “You don’t even know that your sister lives here?””

“Ye Sui said, “She’s just lucky to be married here.””

“The driver continued, “The North Ring Road is a famous wealthy nest in the capital. The housing prices here are six figures per square meter.””

“At this point, the driver paused and said, “Especially your address. This is where a rich family surnamed Lin lives.”” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“”Is that so?”When she heard this, ye Sui’s interest was piqued.”

“She only knew that the Lin family was very rich, but she did not know exactly how rich the Lin family was.”

“Ye Sui continued to ask, “Then is the Lin family especially rich?””

“The driver smiled and said, “The Lin family can no longer be measured by whether they have money or Not! Big Sister, let me tell you this, if your sister really marries into the Lin family, then the two of you will no longer belong to the same world!””

Ye Sui gulped.

The driver glanced at ye Sui.

He had to receive many guests every day and had seen all kinds of people.

“With ye Sui’s appearance, it was obvious that she was a sarcastic person who would climb up and trample on others.”

Did a person like her really have a sister who would marry into a wealthy family?
