“Xi Weiyue narrowed her eyes and turned to look at Xi Muwen. “Dad, what should we do now?” ”

“Xi Muwen said, “Don’t worry, think of a way to change your hair to yours and your mother’s.” ”

“Even though ye Langhua’s hair was already completely white, Yang Jiao was an old woman after all. If one looked carefully, they would be able to find a few white hairs. ”

“Therefore, there was no need to worry that ye Langhua would notice anything different about her hair. ”

Jiang Yan looked up at Xi Muwen. “I can help you guys.”

“Xi Muwen nodded. “Okay, how about this...”Xi Muwen revealed his plan. ”

“After she said that, Xi Weiyue nodded. “Dad, I think this plan will work as long as Jiang Yan cooperates well with us.” ”

“”Don’t worry, there won’t be any problems on my side,”Jiang Yan said. ”

“That’s good.”

“Seeing that the three of them had such a good discussion, Yang Jiao was speechless. “So there’s nothing for me to do?” ”

“XI muwen said, “Just mind your own business.” ”

Yang Jiao rolled her eyes at him.

Xi Muwen turned to look at Jiang Yan. “You go back first. Follow the plan tomorrow.”

Jiang Yan nodded. “Okay.”

“Looking at Jiang Yan’s back, Yang Jiao said worriedly, “Weiyue, do you think Jiang Yan’s words are trustworthy? What if she’s lying to us?”Xi Weiyue patted Yang Jiao’s hand, “Don’t worry, Mom. She Won’t dare lie to us.” ”

Unless Jiang Yan didn’t want to live a good life anymore.

Who would be willing to part with such wealth?

“Yang Jiao was still a little worried. XI weiyue smiled and said, “Alright Mother, don’t worry about these problems. Let’s go back to the room quickly! Father still has to deal with the documents. Let’s not disturb father!” ”

Yang Jiao was pushed out of the study by Xi Weiyue.

In another room.

“Aunt Lang sat under the table lamp, staring at the hair in her hands in a daze. ”

Was that little half moon in the room her little half moon?

“If it wasn’t her little half moon, then where was her little half moon? ”

“Aunt Lang gripped the hair in her hand tightly, and two lines of boiling tears flowed down. ”

“Bodhisattva bless, this must be her little half moon. ” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“It wasn’t easy for her to find her child, so God wouldn’t joke with her... ”

“That night, Aunt Lang didn’t sleep at all. ”

“The next morning, at 6:30 am, Aunt Lang woke up. Because she didn’t sleep well last night, her mental state wasn’t very good. ”

“”Sister, why don’t you sleep a little longer?”Yang Jiao came out of the kitchen with a glass of milk. ”

“Aunt Lang smiled and said, “I have something to do later, so I’ll have to trouble you to take care of Little Half Moon today.” ”

“Yang Jiao said, “We’re all family. Sister, it’s too much of an outsider to say that it’s troublesome. Oh right, do you need me to accompany you? I happen to have nothing to do today.” ”

“Ever since half a month ago, Yang Jiao had stopped playing mahjong. ”

“She had given so much for half a month, but ye Langhua, that crazy woman, did not appreciate it. ”

Could it be that she wanted to bring all those secrets to the earth?

Aunt Lang shook her head. “It’s not a big deal.”

“”Okay.”Yang Jiao hid the disgust in her heart, then, she said, “By the way, sister, an Old Chinese doctor contacted me yesterday. He said that he has a way to cure half a month’s hysteria. If you’re done with your work, let’s bring half a month to the old Chinese doctor to have a look.” ”

“Really?”Aunt Lang raised her head in joy.

“If half a month was half a month, it would be great news for Aunt Lang. ”

“It’s true.”Yang Jiao nodded.

“Aunt Lang continued, “Okay, if there are no problems, let’s Go Tomorrow.” ”

“”Okay, sure.”Yang Jiao placed the milk in front of Aunt Lang. “Sister, drinking a cup of milk in the morning can replenish calcium. Even if you don’t like it, you have to drink some for half a month.” ”

“Yes.”Aunt Lang picked up the milk.

“”Bad Person, you’re a bad person!”At this moment, half a month suddenly rushed over and directly overturned the milk in Aunt Lang’s hand. ”

Splash —

The milk spilled all over Aunt Lang’s body.

“”Half a month! What are you doing!”Yang Jiao immediately stood up and took a tissue to wipe aunt Lang’s clothes. “Sister, are you okay?” ”

“”I’m fine, I’m fine.”Aunt Lang stood up and said, “It’s not the child’s fault. I was the one who lost my balance. Yang Jiao, you don’t have to wipe anymore. I’m going upstairs to change.” ”

“As they were talking, Yang Jiao had already successfully swapped out the sample in Aunt Lang’s pocket. She looked up naturally and said, “This child is too outrageous! Little half a night, she’s your mother. You Can’t treat her like this in the future, understand?” ”

“Bad Person!”
