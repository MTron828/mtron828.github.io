He could even turn a blind eye to his own daughter.

Was there such a father in the world?

“”Wait! Li Da Long, just you wait! I Won’t let him off!”Zhou Cui Hua’s eyes widened. “I curse him, I curse him and that B * Tch to die a horrible death!””

“Speaking up to this point, Zhou Cui Hua seemed to have thought of something and continued, “Hang Hang, I still have something I need you to do.””

“What is it?”Li Hang asked.

“Go and buy me a set of clothes to wear on the road.”

Clothes to wear on the road?

A shroud?

“Li hang swallowed his throat, not knowing what to do.”

“”It can be considered a shroud.”Zhou cuihua continued, “Remember, I want a red dress, red high heels, and a red hat.””

Li Hang was stunned again.

“Zhou Cuihua had seen a horror movie before. It said that if a person was dressed in red before death, they would turn into a malicious spirit after death.”

She wanted to turn into a malicious spirit to seek revenge on Li Dalong and Feng Juan.

She also wanted to make Xia Xiaoman suffer!

This was Zhou Cuihua’s last counterattack.

She believed that there must be a mysterious power in this world.

She would definitely succeed in her revenge.

“Go quickly! What are you waiting for!”Zhou cuihua pushed Li Hang.

“Only then did li hang react. He said with some hesitation, “Mom...””

“Go quickly.”

“Seeing Zhou Cuihua’s determined expression, Li hang could only do as she said. He left the ICU to buy the things that Zhou Cuihua needed.”

“At this moment, Zhou Cuihua seemed to have thought of something and said, “Wait a moment.””

“Do you have anything else?”Li Hang asked.

“Zhou cuihua continued, “Hang Hang, after I die, remember to call your uncle. Although your uncle said some harsh words, he is my brother after all. He will definitely come.””

Zhou Cuihua was really worried about Li hang being alone in the world.

“With Zhou Xiaxia’s uncle taking care of him, he would be more at ease.”

“Okay.”Li hang nodded.

“Zhou cuihua continued, “Alright, go quickly.””

“Li hang nodded and turned to leave. Very soon, he arrived at a funeral parlour. According to Zhou Cuihua’s needs, he bought a red dress, red high heels, and a red hat.”

“By the time Li Hang reached the hospital, Zhou Cuihua’s heart had already stopped beating and she was declared dead.”

“Looking at his mother lying on the hospital bed without a sound, Li hang burst into tears.”

“Mom!”

“Why can’t you wait for me!”

“A nurse at the side advised, “Young Lady, I’m sorry for your loss.””

Li hang could no longer listen to any sound.

Her mind was filled with thoughts of what she should do if Zhou cuihua died?

“Also, was the red dress that she had prepared for Zhou Cuihua really useful?”

What should she do now?

“”Mom!”Li hang cried more and more sadly. In the end, he actually fainted.”

“When Li Hang woke up, the nurse and others had already arranged for Zhou cuihua to wear a shroud.”

“The red dress, the red high heels, and the red hat on her head were all very strange.”

The nurse couldn’t help but shiver.

Why would someone prepare such a burial suit for his mother.

Li Hang contacted a professional driver and dragged Zhou Cuihua’s body to the funeral home.

“Then, he contacted Zhou Xiatian.”

“Zhou Xiatian had already broken off her relationship with Zhou Cuihua and did not want to have anything to do with Zhou Cuihua in the future. However, when she received a call from Li Hang, she was still shocked.”

“”What! Hang Hang, what did you say!”Zhou Xiatian’s voice was anxious and trembling. “What happened to Your Mother?””

“”Uncle, my mother is dead,”Li Hang repeated.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Dead?

How Could Zhou Cuihua be dead?

What happened?

How could this be?

“Zhou Xiatian tried her best to calm herself down and continued, “Hang Hang, this kind of thing is not something to joke about.””

“”Uncle, I’m not joking with you. My mother is indeed dead. She left in a car accident. I’m now at the funeral home in Wuling City, Jiangde Province. If you still treat my mother as your sister, then come to Wuling City.””

“After saying that, Li hang hung up the phone.”

Zhou Xiatian was stunned on the other end.

“Sun Guixiang immediately walked over and asked, “Old Zhou, what’s Wrong?””

“Hearing that, Zhou Xiatian didn’t have any reaction.”

Sun Guixiang asked again.

Zhou Xiatian still didn’t have any reaction.

“Sun Guixiang’s heart was full of confusion, so she reached out and pushed next Zhou Xiatian. “Old Zhou, why aren’t you saying anything?””

Only then did Zhou Xiatian react. She looked at Sun Guixiang in a daze. “Guixiang...”he didn’t know how to say the rest of his words.

“Although he had already broken off his sibling relationship with Zhou Cuihua, Zhou Cuihua was still his biological sister. Now that she was gone, he, as her elder brother, really couldn’t accept it.”
