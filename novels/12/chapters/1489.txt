“Just like that, Xia Wei still felt that song Shiyu had him in his heart.”

She should have known better.

“Song Shiyu had cast a shadow on women due to the trauma of his early years. He would never develop a favorable impression of any member of the opposite sex, so how could he do something like silently waiting for her.”

“In the end, she was still delusional.”

“After tidying up the room, Chen Siyan walked to the balcony and said softly, “Shiyu, I’m going back first.””

Song Shiyu didn’t say anything. His attention was on the phone screen.

Chen Siyan looked at it curiously.

“She thought that song Shiyu was dealing with official business, but she didn’t expect the screen to show a mobile game.”

Mobile game!

Chen Siyan felt that it was a little strange. Since when did song Shiyu start to like mobile games? She quietly wrote down the game’s name and turned around to leave.

“Even when she walked out of Song Shiyu’s room, she did not receive any response from him.”

“When she returned to her room, Chen Siyan took out her phone and opened the app to search for the mobile game song Shiyu had just played.”

“Coincidentally, Xia Wei had sent the information over. When she saw that Chen Siyan was playing the game, she smiled and said, “Miss Chen, do you also like to play pesticides?””

“Chen siyan shook her head, “I saw others playing it, so I wanted to try it. Do you play this too?””

“”Yes.”Xia Wei continued, “This game is going to be very popular this summer! If you want to play it, I can take you.””

“Okay.”Chen Siyan nodded.

On the other side.

The competition ground.

“Although they encountered some twists and turns on the road and were almost thrown a bomb by someone, under ye Zao’s strong reversal, the Black Bentley parked in the parking lot of the competition area at 12:30 am on time.”

“After getting out of the car, Bai Xiaosu’s legs were still a little weak. If ye Zhuo had not reached out to hold her, she would have already fallen.”

“Are You Alright?”Ye Zhuo looked back at Bai Xiaosu.

Bai Xiaosu shook her head. “I’m fine.”

Ye Zhuo took out a pill and handed it to Bai Xiaosu. “This is the heart cleansing pill.”

Bai Xiaosu took the pill and hesitated.

“Before a shooting competition, there would always be a check-up. If one was found to have taken the pill, they would be disqualified from the competition. For a moment, Bai Xiaosu did not dare to take it.”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Don’t worry, this is a medicine to calm one’s mind. There are no prohibited items.””

“”Okay.”Hearing Ye Zhuo’s words, Bai Xiaosu only dared to swallow the pill.”

“It was not just psychological effects, but also the effect of the pill. As soon as he swallowed the pill, Bai Xiaosu felt much more relaxed. His body was full of strength and his legs were no longer weak.”

“For a moment, he was full of energy!”

“”Thank you, Miss Ye. I feel much better now.”Bai Xiaosu looked at Ye Zao.”

“”That’s good.”Ye Zao continued, “When you enter the arena later, remember, no matter how thirsty or hungry you are, don’t touch the food and water inside. Jin Yuyan didn’t succeed just now. She will definitely try to recruit you again.””

“”Okay, I got it.”Bai Xiaosu nodded.”

“Bai Xiaosu looked at his phone and continued, “Miss Ye, it’s about time now. I’ll go in first.””

“Remember what I said.”

“Got it!”

“After Bai Xiaosu left, Ye Zhuo also came to the spectator stand.”

“Although the competition hadn’t started yet, with the host interacting with the audience on stage, it was still very lively.”

Ye Zhuo found a spectator stand exclusive to China.

“There were a total of 50 countries, and each country allowed 50 people to participate. Adding on some of the audience members present, there was a total of more than 5,000 audience members.”

Ye Zao found a seat on the side and sat down.

“Although he did not say anything, it still caused a small sensation.”

“”D * mn, that girl is so beautiful. Looking at her side profile, she is absolutely stunning!””

“Side profile kill! This is!”

“She looks like leaf!”

“”Right, right, right. I was just about to say why she looks so familiar! It might be leaf!””

“I didn’t expect leaf to come to C Nation as well!”

Some people wanted to find a photo of ye Zao for comparison.

“However, any videos or pictures of ye Zao showing his face had been erased.”

Even the variety shows that he had participated in had been edited after the broadcast.

“At present, there were no photos of ye Zao on the Internet.”

“After ye Zao put on the wireless headphones, she began to play games. She did not notice that she had become a scenery in the eyes of others.”

Bai Xiaosu came backstage.

The contestants from 50 countries were basically all here.

Everyone was practicing shooting.

The atmosphere was a little tense.

“Bai Xiaosu was not going to practice anymore, but seeing that everyone was so serious, she took out her gun and began to contact them.”
