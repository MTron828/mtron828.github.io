The sorghum was sweet and sticky. It could only be relieved by eating and drinking.

“”Sister, brother Ze.”Ye Han walked in from the door. ”

Ye Zhuo looked back slightly and looked at Ye Han. “Cen Shaoqing didn’t come with you?”

“No.”Ye Han shook his head. “My brother-in-law is busy with something. Let me come over first.”

“Cen Shaoqing did not plan to stay in the general alliance, so he naturally would not take over the position of General Alliance. Before he left, he had to arrange everything else. ”

“”OH.”Ye Zao said, “It just so happens that father and mother aren’t done yet either.” ”

“Ye Han sat beside Lin Ze. Although the two brothers were not blood-related, they chatted very happily. ”

“During this period of time in the S Galaxy, Lin Ze had come into contact with a lot of high-tech and gained a lot of knowledge. ”

“Ye Han looked at Lin Ze and seemed to have suddenly thought of something. He said somewhat excitedly, “Brother Ze, you don’t have a girlfriend yet, right?” ”

“What’s Wrong?”Lin Ze was stunned.

“Ye Han continued, “If you don’t have one, I can introduce you to one!” ”

“Speaking up to this point, Ye Han turned to look at Ye Zhuo. “SIS, do you still remember Bai Mo?” ”

“”Bai Mo?”Ye Zhuo frowned slightly. For a moment, he couldn’t remember who this Bai Mo was. ”

“Ye Han continued, “Bai Mo is grandfather Bai’s granddaughter! The one who is extremely beautiful and has two dimples when she smiles!” ”

Bai Mo was a very caring girl.

They had known each other since ye Han was still a vagabond.

“Now that he said that, ye Zao seemed to have some impression of her. He continued, “She doesn’t have a boyfriend either?” ”

“”Yes, Bai Mo doesn’t have a boyfriend either. When I met grandfather Bai a while ago, he was still worried about this matter!”Ye Han continued, “Sister, do you feel that Bai Mo and brother Ze are quite compatible?” ”

Ye Zhuo looked at Lin Ze and narrowed his eyes. “They are indeed compatible.”

“Lin Ze was a little speechless. “Since when did fourth uncle and fourth aunt possess you two?”In the Lin family, only Lin Qingxuan and Xia Xiaoman were the most enthusiastic matchmakers. In just two years, they had already managed to get several couples together. ”

“”Brother Ze, I’m serious!”Ye Han continued, “Don’t look at how many people in the s galaxy have prejudice against the people on Earth, but I Promise You, Bai Mo will definitely not! “Look, my sister already has a boyfriend, and you’re older than her. You Can’t stay single forever, right?” ”

Lin Ze didn’t know how to face the sudden urge to get married

“Ye Zhuo didn’t mind watching the show. “Brother, why don’t we let ye Han set you up? People need to get married. It’s not good for you to stay single forever.” ”

“”I’m not in a hurry,”Lin ze said. ”

“Ye Han said, “Brother Ze, let’s just meet. It’s not like we’ll lose anything. If we don’t like each other, we can still be friends! How about this? I’ll invite her over today. What do you think?” ”

“Lin Ze understood ye Han’s personality too well. If he said no, Ye Han would definitely not give up. ”

“After thinking for a while, Lin Ze nodded slightly. “That works too.” ”

“Seeing that there was a chance, ye Han immediately said, “Okay, I’ll go right away!” ”

“Not long after, Lin Jincheng and ye Shu came out of the room after changing their clothes. ”

Old Mrs. Cen and Zhou Xiang had also arrived.

The group of people boarded the aircraft and set off for the beach.

“After boarding the aircraft, old Mrs. Cen suddenly realized that Cen Shaoqing had not come. She asked, “Aren’t we waiting for Shaoqing?” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and replied, “He said that we will meet up with him after we go to the beach.” ”

“OH.”Old Mrs. Cen nodded. “I see! That works too!”

The beach was located at the southernmost end of the s galaxy.

The weather was very good. It was neither hot nor cold. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Compared to Earth, the beaches here had their own merits. However, in Ye Zao’s opinion, the beaches here were not even half as good as Earth’s. ”

“The Golden Beach was beautiful and soulless. Other than the beautiful plants, the animals in the sea were inedible and only suitable for viewing. ”

“Not only did ye Zao like to eat desserts, he also liked to eat seafood. ”

“While ye Zao was enjoying the scenery along the coastline, a piece of gauze draped over ye Zao’s shoulder. ”

Ye Zao looked back slightly and saw an overly handsome side profile. “When did you arrive?”

“Just now.”Cen Shaoqing lowered his eyes and carefully tied the light muslin around ye Zao’s shoulder. “Why are you wearing so little?”

“Why are you like an old antique?”Ye Zao looked at Cen Shaoqing. “Do you see anyone on the beach wearing more than me?”

“Ye Zao was wearing a beach skirt with a sling. Other than his shoulder and collarbone, everything else was wrapped in fabric. ”
