“Okay.”

“After saying what he was thinking about, Li da long let out a sigh of relief. He whistled as he went to take a shower. He also went to prepare for his meeting with his girlfriend the next day. ”

“Meanwhile, Li Hang also went back to study the music ticket. ”

He thought that the ticket was fake.

“However, after checking with his friend, not only was it not fake, his friend even said excitedly, “Oh my god, Hang Hang! Where did you buy this ticket? Can you get me one too?” ”

“It belongs to my mother’s friend.”Li Hang had always been very elegant and kind in front of others. “I’ll help you ask tomorrow.”

“”Okay, thank you!” ”

The ticket was not fake.

“Under the light, Li Hang narrowed his eyes. Could it be that Zhou Cuihua had met a rich man? ”

The next night at 6 pm. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Li hang arrived at the location that he had arranged with Zhou Cuihua.

“Zhou Cuihua was wearing exquisite makeup and waved at Li Hang. “Hang hang, over here.” ”

Li hang jogged over.

“Zhou cuihua said with some dissatisfaction, “Why are you only here now! I’ve been waiting for you for quite a while. Rich people pay special attention to the concept of time. We can’t be late.” ”

“”I was delayed by something at the last minute,”Li Hang explained. ”

“”Alright, Alright, let’s go quickly.”Zhou cuihua carried her satchel and said, “When you meet someone later, be more alert. Remember to call for help, okay?” ”

“Yes.”Li hang nodded.

The mother and daughter soon arrived at the entrance of the theater.

Zhou cuihua looked around but did not see anyone.

“It was already 6:20. Logically speaking, boss Wang should have arrived earlier. ”

“Li hang looked around and continued, “He’s not here?” ”

Zhou cuihua nodded. “I didn’t see him. Did he get delayed by something?”

“Li hang smiled and said, “Mom, you didn’t get stood up, right?” ”

“After saying that, Li hang continued, “Even if he didn’t get stood up, this man’s attitude makes people speechless! He’s actually late! It’s obvious that he doesn’t put you in his eyes!” ”

“”Don’t talk nonsense.”Zhou cuihua said, “Your uncle Wang isn’t that kind of person!” ”

“Then where is he?”Li Hang asked.

“”He must be on his way,”Zhou Cuihua said. ”

Li hang shook his head speechlessly.

“At this moment, a young man in uniform walked over to the mother and daughter. “Excuse me, is this Ms. Zhou?” ”

“”I am,”Zhou Cuihua said. ”

“The young man said respectfully, “Hello, Ms. Zhou. I am chief Wang’s assistant. Chief Wang has been waiting for you in the VIP room for a long time. Please follow me.” ”

“Hearing this, Li Hang was a little stunned. ”

“Zhou cuihua glanced at Li Hang, her eyes full of pride. ”

She knew that boss Wang would not lie to her.

The mother and daughter followed the assistant all the way to the VIP waiting room of the theater.

“”Ms. Zhou.”Seeing Zhou cuihua, boss Wang, who was sitting there, immediately stood up. ”

“Boss Wang was about forty or fifty years old. His facial features were delicate and pretty, and he did not have any greasy feeling. ”

This was something that Li Hang had not expected.

Could it be that Zhou Cuihua was really lucky?

“”Mr. Wang,”Zhou Cuihua said with a smile, “Let me introduce you to my daughter, Li Hang.” ”

“Li hang said politely, “Uncle Wang, I’m Li Hang, Mu Zi Li, Qihang’s hang.” ”

“Boss Wang nodded with a smile. “Li Hang, good name, good name.” ”

“Thank you.”

“Without batting an eyelid, Li hang noticed that boss Wang was wearing an internationally famous luxury brand suit. On her wrist was a watch worth seven figures. She had studied luxury goods before, and her eyes were very sharp, so she could recognize it just like that, these things were not imitations. ”

“Coupled with his aura and mannerisms, he did not look like an ordinary person. ”

“In other words, boss Wang was indeed a real estate boss with assets of over a hundred million. ”

“Boss Wang continued, “The musical is about to begin. Let’s go to the front first.” ”

“Okay.”

“Boss Wang was clearly a high-level VIP of the theater. Not only did he have a VIP waiting room, but he also had his own private passageway. ”

“Seeing the envious gaze from the ordinary seats, Li Hang’s heart immediately lit up with a sense of superiority. He unconsciously puffed out his chest. ”

The previous her had never experienced this kind of feeling before.
