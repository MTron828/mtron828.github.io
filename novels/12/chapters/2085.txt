Translator: 549690339

Cen Shaoqing could not remain indifferent when it came to Cen Haifeng.

“He hoped that Cen Haifeng would be safe, but he was also afraid that Cen Haifeng would be the one sitting on the summit of the General Alliance. ”

“”I can’t say the exact time. Let’s wait first,”ye Zhuo said. ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“”Oh right, there’s one more thing.”Ye Zhuo seemed to have thought of something and continued to speak. ”

“What is it?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“Ye Zhuo took a sip of coffee. “The successive monarchs of the general alliance have implemented the system of succession. Cen is the surname of the General Alliance. Currently, the General Alliance of the General Alliance is called Cen Haifeng.” ”

Cen Haifeng?

“What did you say?”Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “I said that the successive monarchs of the General Alliance have implemented the system of succession...” ”

“”Not that sentence, it’s the last sentence!”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

The last sentence?

“Ye Zhuo thought for a moment and continued, “Currently, the General Alliance of the General Alliance is called Cen Haifeng.” ”

Cen Haifeng!

It was actually Cen Haifeng!

Cen Shaoqing’s fingers that were holding the coffee cup had already turned slightly white due to excessive force.

“Seeing that something was wrong with him, ye Zhuo asked tentatively, “Could it be that... Uncle is also called Cen Haifeng?” ”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“It was fine if they looked the same, but their names were exactly the same. This was too much of a coincidence! ”

Could it be...

These two people were really the same person.

“Ye Zhuo frowned slightly and continued, “The Sea of the sea, the peak of the mountain?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing then nodded. His phoenix-like eyes were dark and heavy, almost bottomless, emitting a dangerous aura. ”

“Ye Zhuo raised his hand and pressed on his temple. “Cen Shaoqing, didn’t you tell me that your grandfather also died prematurely?” ”

“Yes.”

“What about your great-grandfather?”

“Same.”Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips opened slightly.

The men of the Cen family seemed to be unable to escape this fate.

“Cen Shaoqing’s father had suffered a shipwreck. His grandfather had also gone missing in an accident. His great-grandfather had also gone missing in an accident. Moreover, their bodies had never been found. ”

“What if we continue searching?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“CEN Shaoqing said, “I heard from my grandmother that my great-grandfather’s father, who was also my great-grandfather, also died young.” ”

“Ye Zhuo’s beautiful eyes narrowed slightly as she asked, “When the core robot appeared in your life previously, did it do anything to hurt you?” ”

“Never.”Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips opened slightly.

“In other words, the core robot that appeared in Cen Shaoqing’s life previously only wanted to get close to Cen Shaoqing... ”

“Under normal circumstances, the General Alliance would not pay attention to the people on Earth for no reason. ”

Unless there was a purpose.

“For example, Cen Shaoqing had a special relationship with that person in the General Alliance. ”

“Ye Zhuo looked at Cen Shaoqing, then he said, “Although I don’t have enough evidence to prove that that person in the General Alliance is Uncle, you have to be mentally prepared. I think that that person is most likely uncle. If that person is an uncle, we will be able to find out the reason why they approached you previously. I heard that the one in the alliance has reached the age of abdication. They are looking for you... ... ...” ”

The following words were self-evident.

They must be looking for Cen Shaoqing because of the succession.

There was no expression on Cen Shaoqing’s face.

Memories of his childhood appeared in his mind.

Cen Haifeng was a responsible and persistent father.

“In his impression, Cen Haifeng was a very artistic person who liked everything about the retro. ”

Cen Shaoqing first came into contact with the zither when he was three years old.

Cen Haifeng taught him hand-by-hand.

“The zither manual said, “The joy of the zither can be taught by observing the wind, it can control one’s soul, it can distinguish between joy and anger, it can delight one’s mind, it can calm one’s mind, it can strengthen one’s courage, it can cut off the secular world, it can block ghosts and gods, this zither is a good person.” ”

Cen Shaoqing still remembered the expression on Cen Haifeng’s face when he read this paragraph to him.

“After a while, Cen Shaoqing turned his eyes slightly and looked at Ye Zhuo. “Does the person from the main alliance have any descendants in the main alliance?” ”

“Ye Zhuo nodded. “Yes, Dongli is that person’s only descendant.” ”

Dongli.

People called him the young master of Dongli.

“How Old Are you this year?”Cen Shaoqing continued to ask.

“Ye Zhuo continued to say, “I’m not too sure about the exact age. No one has ever seen Dongli in the S Galaxy.” ”

This was also the reason why ye Zhuo suspected that the man in the alliance was Cen Shaoqing’s father.

Cen Shaoqing’s phoenix-like eyes narrowed slightly.

“”Don’t think too much first.”Ye Zhuo continued to say, “Perhaps my deduction is wrong. Everything will wait for the test report to come out.” ”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Have you had any core robots around you recently?”Ye Zhuo asked.
