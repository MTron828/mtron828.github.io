“During this period of time, the eight great clans were also working together to search for information about Ye Zhuo. ”

Unfortunately.

The stone sank into the sea.

Ye Zhuo seemed to have really disappeared from this world.

Mr. Ye?

“Hearing this, Wu Han frowned. “Head clan leader, you remembered wrongly. My surname is Wu.” ”

Wu? Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

How could ye Han have the surname Wu!

“Hearing this, the head chief’s brows also furrowed tightly together. He smiled and said, “Team leader Ye, don’t joke around.” ”

Joke around.

Ye Han was definitely joking around.

“Wu Han said expressionlessly, “Head chief, I’m not joking around with you. My surname is Wu. My name is Wu Han. You’ve remembered wrongly.” ”

“Seeing that ye Han did not seem to be joking around, the head chief was stunned. He even wondered if he had remembered wrongly. ”

No!

Impossible!

He did not remember wrongly.

“The head chief looked at Wu Han, his eyes filled with a complicated expression. ”

The person in front of him was clearly ye Han.

When did he become Wu Han?

Or did he recognize the wrong person?

“”No, that’s not right! I did not remember wrongly, nor did I recognize wrongly! You are team leader Ye Han!”The head chief looked at Wu Han and continued, “Team leader Ye, could it be that you have forgotten Miss Ye?” ”

“”The deceased has passed away.”Wu Han said coldly, “Head clan leader, don’t mention this person again in the future.” ”

The deceased has passed away?

Don’t mention this person again in the future?

The head clan leader looked at Ye Han in disbelief.

“Ye Han was extremely loyal to ye Zao, so how could he say such cold and heartless words. ”

No.

This was not ye Han.

The Wu Han he knew was definitely not this kind of person!

“Ye Han’s life was given to him by Ye Zao. He could risk his life for ye Zao, but he definitely would not be like this! ”

The head chief took a few steps back.

“Wu Han looked at the head chief, then he said, “Head chief, I can understand your feelings. “But the dead have passed away, and the living are like this. As people, we must learn to look forward. The old will always be replaced by the new. “To be immersed in the past is not responsible for yourself, and it is also not responsible for the dead.” ”

“”Wu Han, right?”The head chief made a ‘please’gesture, “Please leave immediately, I don’t Welcome You Here!” ”

“Perhaps he really made a mistake. The person in front of him just happened to look like Ye Han, he was not ye Han at all! ”

“Even if the whole world would betray ye Zhuo, Ye Han would not. ”

“Therefore, this person could not be ye Han at all. ”

“Wu Han stood there without moving and continued, “Head chief, I came here this time to retrieve the star-crossing case for Miss Qiu. Please immediately take out the information on the star-crossing case.” ”

Information on the star-crossing case?

Miss Qiu?

Could it be that this Wu Han was someone by Qiu Di’s side?

“The head chief continued, “You Mean Miss Qiu is Qiu Di?” ”

“”Yes.”Wu Han nodded, a cold light flashed in his eyes, “Head Chief, Please Watch Your Words and actions. Miss Qiu’s name is not something you can address casually!” ”

“The head chief looked at Wu Han like this, the expression in his eyes was unclear. After a while, the head chief continued, “What right does Qiu di have for me to address her as Miss Qiu?” ”

“When Ye Zhuo was still in the state of changyue, Qiu di had often used the name of Xiao Ye Zhuo to appear in public. Hence, the head chief and the others did not have a good impression of Qiu Di. ”

“Wu Han narrowed his eyes. In the next second, he teleported to the side of the head chief. The sharp emei thorn was pressed against the head chief’s throat as if it could pierce through his throat at any time. ”

“The leader held his breath and looked at the emei thorn pressed against his throat. The shock in his eyes turned to disbelief, and finally, pain. ”

“That’s right, it was pain. ”

He didn’t expect this person before him to really be ye Han.

It was ye Han.

This person was ye Han.

“In Chang Yue, other than ye Han, there was no one else who knew how to use the Emei Thorn. ”

“The Emei Thorn was one of China’s traditional weapons, and it was Wu Han’s personal weapon. Chang Yue’s space civilization had long passed level 3, so no one else knew how to use such an ancient weapon. ”

“Therefore, in Chang Yue, the only person who could use the emei thorn was ye Han. ”

The leader couldn’t understand why ye Han would betray him!

“Ye Han followed ye Zao to the edge of a mountain and into the Sea of fire. Ye Zao had almost lost his life because he saved ye Han. Even though the two of them were not blood siblings, the relationship between them had long surpassed that of normal siblings. ”

“Even if the universe was destroyed and the entire human race betrayed ye Zao, Ye Han would never betray ye Zao. ”
