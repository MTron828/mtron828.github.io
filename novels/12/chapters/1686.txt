“Professor Feng furrowed his brows tightly, “Miss ye must have brought back 56 milliliters of volcanic crystals. Three milliliters were used for the experiment, and now there are still 53 milliliters left. Not only are there people watching, but they also check it three or four times a day! It’s a little less than that. Even if it’s half a millilitre less, it will be immediately discovered by others!” ”

“Professor Feng continued, “If Professor Gamira wants us to be exposed so quickly, then we will do it immediately!” ”

Gamira frowned slightly.

“He had spent a lot of effort to place two high-level spies in the Cen family base. He could provide information at any time, but he didn’t want Professor Feng and director Ma to be exposed so quickly! ”

“”Professor Feng, you misunderstood. I didn’t mean that!”GAMIRA paused and continued, “How about this, you two think of a way to bring out the analysis report on the volcanic crystal from the base.” ” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Bringing out a report was much easier than bringing out a volcanic crystal.

“Although there were no volcanic crystals, having an analysis report was better than not having one. ”

“As the saying goes, knowing one’s enemy and knowing one’s enemy is a sure win! ”

The most important thing for them now was to quickly grasp the secret of the Cen family base.

“Upon hearing this, director Ma immediately nodded. “That’s not a problem. Just leave it to us!” ”

“Jamila smiled and said, “Then I’ll leave it to the two of you. Let’s contact each other on Instagram. I’ll be leaving First!” ”

“I’ll send you off!”Director Ma stood up to send Jamila off.

Professor Feng sat in his original position.

“A few minutes later, director Ma returned after sending Jamila off. ”

“Professor Feng said with a very ugly expression, “Why did you agree to it?” ”

Director Ma was a little confused. “Agree to what?”

“Professor Feng continued, “I promised to bring him the analysis report of the volcanic crystal!”! “When we signed the contract, it was clearly agreed that Professor Cara was only cooperating with us to study the speed of light. Why did he agree to help them get the volcanic crystal now?”? “Director Ma, you should know what the volcanic crystal means to the base, right?” ”

“”So that’s what you’re talking about!”Director ma smiled and said, “Professor Feng, since we’ve already signed an agreement with Jamila, what’s the point of worrying so much? Anyway, we’re going to become C Nation people sooner or later!” ”

“Betraying once was betraying, betraying twice was also betraying, so it was better to simply betray them completely! ”

“When they decided to take this step back then, there was no turning back! ”

Professor Feng frowned.

“Director ma continued, “Professor Feng, don’t think too much! Leave the volcanic crystal report to me. We will do it the same as last time. Just cooperate with me!” ”

“”I don’t agree!”Professor Feng continued, “How can Jamila get her hands on such a confidential thing like the volcanic crystal!” ”

The most important thing was that this was not something that should be done in the agreement!

“Professor Feng dreamed of proving herself to ye Zhuo and proving Europa, but she had never thought of completely becoming enemies with the base. ”

This was not the result she wanted!

“”It’s not like you want us to get the volcanic crystal! It’s just a report! Professor Feng, you’re making a big fuss over nothing!”Director ma said. ”

Professor Feng did not say anything.

“Director ma continued, “Professor Feng, don’t tell me you’re going to quit Midway?” ”

“”I don’t want to quit. I just think that Jamila doesn’t have the spirit of a contract!”Professor Feng continued, “He asked us to get the volcanic crystal report today. It’s just the beginning. I don’t know what he wants us to Get Tomorrow!” ”

“”Then do as he says.”Director Ma took a sip of coffee. “Professor Feng, there’s one thing I hope you understand.” ”

“What is it?”Professor Feng raised his head to look at director Ma.

“”At this point, we have no way out.”Director ma continued, “We can only do as Jamila instructed.” ”

“If Jamila leaked this matter, would cen Shaoqing still forgive them and pretend that nothing had happened? ”

It was impossible!

They were now equivalent to Jamila’s marionettes. They had no choice but to listen to Jamila’s arrangements.

“Director Ma’s words woke them up from their dreams, and their faces suddenly turned a little pale. ”

“Director ma continued, “But don’t worry. Jamila is still counting on us to research the speed of light technology together. He won’t let us take the risk.” ”

“Since things had come to this point, what else could professor Feng Do? ”

She could only continue to follow this plan!

“How are you going to get the analysis report of the volcanic crystal?”Professor Feng looked at director Ma. “Do the same thing again?”

Director ma narrowed his eyes. “Let’s return to the base first. You just have to cooperate with me.”
