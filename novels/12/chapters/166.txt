Chapter 167: 087: tear the mistress apart, divorce! 3

Ye Zhuo effortlessly received an Dongliang’s bill.

The bill showed.

An Dongliang had rented a house in an upscale neighborhood.

Needless to say, this house was used to support the mistress.

Moreover, an Dongliang also transferred money to a woman named Liang Xinyi every month.

The highest transfer was 30,000 yuan.

Other times, it was 12,000 yuan.

An Lizi was trembling with anger as she held the bill. “My father mentioned that the woman’s surname is Liang. This woman named Liang Xinyi is that mistress! It’s been five years! So he’s been with this woman for five years!”

“Zhonghua, can you help me look up Liang Xinyi?”An Lizi asked.

Ye Zhuo nodded.

Not long after, he found out all the information about Liang Xinyi.

Liang Xinyi.

Female.

......

45 years old.

Her husband had been paralyzed in bed for many years and had a son who was studying abroad.

Zhao pingting frowned and said, “D * MN! This woman is six years older than your father! No wonder she doesn’t look young anymore! Your father really has a strong taste!”

An Lizi felt disgusted!

Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly. “He does have a strong taste.”

An Lizi took a deep breath. “Zao Zao, thank you for today. I know what to do.”

“What do you plan to do?”Zhao Pingting asked.

An Lizi said, “Let my father leave with nothing!”

She had already thought it through. This marriage must be divorced!

Even if her mother wanted to keep this marriage, she would still persuade them to get a divorce!

“Lizi, it’s good that you’ve thought it through.”Zhao pingting reached out and hugged an Lizi. “Do your best. The sun always shines after the storm. Burning and I will always be behind you. If you need any help, feel free to call us.”

Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Pingting is right. If you encounter any problems, you can look for us anytime.”

“Okay.”An Lizi smiled.

It turned out that it felt so good to have two friends behind her when she was in trouble.

For the first time in her life, she truly understood the importance of a close friend.

Xia Xiaoman was still busy in the supermarket.

An Lizi looked at Xia Xiaoman’s figure and felt a sense of sadness.

She worked hard to earn money to support her family, yet an Dongliang used the hard-earned money she earned to raise a woman outside.

How ridiculous.

“Mom.”An Lizi composed herself and walked to Xia Xiaoman’s side.

“Lizi is back.”Xia Xiaoman said as she tidied up the shelves.

An lizi continued, “Mom, Where’s My Dad?”

Xia Xiaoman frowned slightly. She felt that something was wrong with an Lizi. “You Child, why do you keep asking where your dad went these few days? He went to stock up.”

He went to stock up again.

“Mom, why does he always go to stock up? is our family in such a dire shortage?”An Lizi asked.

Xia Xiaoman smiled and said, “Business has been busy recently. The imported candy sold very well last time. It’s a pity that your father went there a few times but did not get the goods. Hence, he went there again today!”

As they had known each other since they were young, Xia Xiaoman had absolute trust in an Dongliang.

She had never suspected anything.

“Mom, do you trust my dad that much?”An Lizi asked.

Xia Xiaoman stretched out her hand and patted an Lizi’s head. “He is my daughter’s father and my husband. If I don’t trust him, who would I trust? Lizi, tell me honestly, what happened to you recently?”

An Lizi felt extremely sad.

Her mother trusted an Dongliang so much.

However, he had betrayed her.

An lizi continued, “Mother, have you ever thought that my father didn’t go to stock up at all?”

“If he didn’t go to stock up, where else could he have gone?”Xia Xiaoman asked.

An Lizi took a deep breath. “Mother, Let’s go upstairs and talk.”

“I’m still busy!”Xia Xiaoman said.

She was really busy.

There were two floors of the supermarket, a total of 1,200 square meters, and she only hired 10 employees.

She had to handle many things herself.

An Lizi grabbed Xia Xiaoman’s arm and suddenly couldn’t control her emotions. “Mom, I really have something to tell you!”

Seeing an Lizi like this, Xia Xiaoman was shocked and hurriedly jumped down from the service ladder. “Lizi, what’s wrong with you? Good Girl, don’t Cry! Mom will go upstairs with you!”

The mother and daughter went upstairs.

Xia Xiaoman quickly found a tissue to wipe an Lizi’s face. “Lizi, what’s wrong? Did Someone Bully You? Tell Mom!”

“Mom!”An Lizi hugged Xia Xiaoman and cried loudly.

“What’s wrong? Child, What’s Wrong?”Xia Xiaoman was very anxious.
