“”Keep an eye on him,”ye Zao said.”

Cen Jiangxia frowned. “Is there a problem?”

Yu Gong had worked in the base for more than ten years and was usually very serious. There shouldn’t be any mistakes.

“”Come here,”ye Zao said.”

Cen Jiang walked to ye Zao’s side.

“Ye Zao Pressed Defense No. 1, then pressed attack No. 3.”

“A transparent screen instantly popped up in the air. On the screen, there were four big words:”

Dangerous Operation!

Cen Jiang frowned and didn’t say anything.

“Ye Zao pressed the ‘cancel’button, then pressed Defense No. 1. This time, no information popped up.”

The defense system could be used normally.

“Then, ye Zao pressed attack No. 3, but no information popped up. Attack No. 3 could also be used normally.”

“In other words, as long as the two buttons were not used at the same time, the defense system would not have any problems.”

“However, the defense cabin designed by Ye Zao was designed to be both defensive and offensive!”

“If it only defended and did not attack, or only attacked and did not defend, it would be no different from a failure.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Cen Jiang knew ye Zao’s design. When he saw this scene, he frowned. “How could this be!””

“There’s a mole in our district.”Ye Zao hit the nail on the head.

“The Mole is Yu Gong?”Cen Jiang said in disbelief. “But Yu Gong is an old technician in our base. He doesn’t need to do this!”

“Ye Zao said while repairing the system, “Don’t publicize this matter for now.””

“If there was really a problem with Yu Gong, then there must be someone else behind him.”

Cen Jiang nodded. “I know.”

“After saying that, CEN Jiang continued, “Miss Ye, if there really is a problem with Yu Gong, how do you plan to deal with him?””

“Ye Zhuo’s tone was a little light. “According to the rules of the base, deal with him as you should.””

“I understand.”Cen Jiang nodded.

On the other side of the base.

“Ever since ye Zhuo signed the bet agreement with C Nation, word had spread throughout the base!”

“Because of this, a few elders wanted to organize a strike, but with the example of professor Yue, everyone had the heart, but they didn’t have the guts.”

“Helplessly, the matter of the strike could only be put on hold!”

“These few days, the happiest person was of course Tang Xue.”

“Ever since she found out that ye Zhuo had signed a bet agreement with C Nation, her heart was completely at ease.”

“Now, she just had to wait for Ye Zhuo’s bad luck.”

“When that time came, she wanted to see if Cen Shaoqing would still love ye Zhuo as much as he did now!”

“Sister Xue.”The assistant stood outside the door and knocked.

Tang Xue came back to her senses. “Come in.”

“The assistant walked in. “Sister Xue. I’ve already tried to persuade Tang Mi, but she seems to have steeled her heart. No matter what I say, she’s unwilling to leave the aircraft carrier project team.””

“Tang Xue snorted coldly. “As expected, she’s a piece of SH * t that can’t be helped!””

“The assistant continued, “Sister Xue, I feel that you’ve already been benevolent enough to Tang Mi! It’s fine if she doesn’t appreciate it! Anyway, there will be days when she’ll regret it!””

“”I’m her cousin. She can not appreciate it, but I can’t just let it go.”Tang Xue continued, “Where is she now?””

That’s right.

“Tang Xue and Tang Mi were cousins. However, although they were related by blood, their relationship was not as deep as that of ordinary sisters.”

“It was because Tang Mi was not talented and was not as smart as Tang Xue since she was young. Tang Xue entered the base directly and looked at Tang Mi. Not only did she stutter, she had taken the CEN base test three times.”

“Although she passed the last test, Tang Xue felt that it was because of her. If she wasn’t in the base, Tang Mi wouldn’t have been able to enter the Cen’s base even if she took the test for her whole life. After all, Tang Mi was her cousin, the chief examiner had to give her some face.”

“Not to mention that her father was an elder of the Cen’s base. Therefore, Tang Mi was able to enter the base smoothly because of her.”

“However, not only did Tang mi not appreciate her kindness, she did not even put her sister in her eyes.”

“The assistant continued, “She’s in the Big C area office.””

“Tang Xue nodded and stood up from her office chair. “Alright, I’ll go out for a while.””

“Tang Xue walked all the way to the Big C area, where Tang Mi’s office was.”

Tang Mi was studying the nano-defense inside and did not even notice that Tang Xue had entered.

Tang Xue just looked at Tang Mi with a mocking look in her eyes.

“This cousin of hers didn’t really think that ye Zhuo would lead them to create an aircraft carrier and walk towards the highest peak of scientific research in the world, right?”
