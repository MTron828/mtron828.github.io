“In terms of attacking the heart, no one could compare to XI Weiyue.”

“Ten years, twenty years?” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“If it were anyone else, would they be able to do what Xi Weiyue did?”

“Not to mention ten or twenty years, they probably wouldn’t even be able to do it for a month or half a month.”

“From this, it could be seen that Xi Weiyue really regarded little half moon as her elder sister.”

“Hearing Xi Weiyue’s words, the few of them were very touched, especially Aunt Lang. She almost choked out her sobs, and her heart was very uncomfortable.”

“Xi Weiyue was probably the person in this world who missed little half moon the most besides her, right?”

She was the same as herself. They all hoped to find little half moon.

“Xi Weiyue’s gaze swept across everyone’s faces, and the corners of her mouth curled up into an imperceptible sneer.”

Idiots.

They were all idiots!

Didn’t these idiots know that their birthday wishes wouldn’t come true once they were spoken?

Ye Langhua wanted to find Ye Banyue?

In the next life!

No!

She wouldn’t be able to find Ye Banyue in the next life!

“”Weiyue, thank you.”Aunt Lang hugged Xi Weiyue. “But Aunty doesn’t need you to lose ten years of your life. As long as I can find half a month, I’m willing to give up everything, even my entire life.””

“As a mother, Auntie Lang could sacrifice everything for half a month.”

“Xi Weiyue raised her hand to hug Auntie Lang back and said in a raspy voice, “Auntie, actually, I’m just like you. I hope that sister half a month will come back soon. I believe that one day, sister half a month will come back to take care of you.””

Take care of her?

Ye Langhua had made them wait for so many years in vain. They were just waiting to die a horrible death!

“Thinking of this, Xi Weiyue’s eyes shone with a cold light.”

“MMM.”Aunt Lang nodded. “I believe that my little half-moon will definitely come back. She will definitely come back.”

“After a moment, Aunt Lang calmed down and released XI Weiyue.”

“Xi Weiyue blew out the cake, then cut the cake and divided it among everyone.”

“The Cake Xiao Mei bought was not big. It was a total of two pounds and 900 yuan. It was a cream cheese cake, sweet but not greasy.”

Xi Weiyue took a symbolic bite and stopped eating.

She was afraid that she would hurt her stomach with such cheap food.

“”Miss Weiyue, why did you only take one bite?”Xiao Mei asked in confusion.”

“XI weiyue smiled and said, “I’ve been losing weight recently. I can’t eat anything too sweet. Otherwise, I won’t be able to eat anything during this period of time.””

“OH.”Xiao Mei nodded.

“Aunt Lang continued, “I’ve even cooked some longevity noodles for you. I’ll bring them over now.””

“XI weiyue smiled and said, “Sure, I like eating the noodles you made personally, Aunt Lang.””

“Soon, Aunt Lang brought the longevity noodles over.”

“Slowly, a big bowl was served.”

The mushroom soup had a delicious base and was covered with a poached egg. The poached egg was sprinkled with chopped green onions and chili sauce. It looked like it would open one’s taste buds.

“In order to please Aunt Lang, Xi Weiyue finished the bowl of noodles. “Aunt, your cooking is really good. It would be great if you could eat your noodles every day in the future.””

“Aunt Lang smiled and said, “If you like it, you can come here every day.””

“Xi Weiyue put down her bowl and chopsticks. She looked at Aunt Lang and said very seriously, “Aunt, why don’t you move back to live with us?””

“The closer one is to the water, the better.”

Many things could only develop more smoothly after ye Langhua went back.

“No.”Aunt Lang shook her head.

She still had to wait here for half a month.

“Xi Weiyue seemed to see the worry in Aunt Lang’s eyes, “Aunt, I know you have to wait here for sister half a month. Actually, it’s the same for Xiao Mei and the others. When sister half a month comes back, they will definitely inform you immediately.””

“Xiao Mei immediately nodded in agreement. “Miss Weiyue is right, Aunty Lang, why don’t you go back with her? You’re already over sixty years old this year, it’s time for you to enjoy yourself.””

Enjoy Yourself?

A self-deprecating look appeared in Aunty Lang’s eyes.

She had yet to find the child.

What reason did she have to enjoy herself?

“Aunty Lang looked up at Xi Weiyue. “Weiyue, I know you’re filial, but now is not the time.””

“Xi Weiyue sighed, her eyes glimmering.”

“Today was Little Half Moon’s birthday. Xi Weiyue wanted to stay over, but Aunt Lang rejected her. “Good girl, I appreciate your kindness, but at a time like this, I’d rather be alone.””

Xi Weiyue and Little Half Moon looked very similar.

“Many a time, Aunt Lang was desperately trying to control her emotions. She fought to not let herself replace Xi Weiyue as Little Half Moon.”
