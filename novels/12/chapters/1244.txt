“The cat abuse video had already caused a stir, Allie had naturally seen it too! ”

“Brother Meow was so cute, he was the darling of the entire financial group. ”

Who would have thought that he would be tortured to death by Zhao Xueyin in the end!

“When she first saw the video, Allie could not believe it was real. ”

Zhao Xueyin was simply a snake with a scorpion’s heart!

“Allie was just a small secretary, yet she dared to look at her like that! ”

It was a rebellion!

It was a rebellion!

It was simply a rebellion against the heavens!

“”Stop!”Looking at Allie’s back, Zhao Xueyin said. ” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Allie stopped in her tracks. “Miss Zhao, is there anything else?” ”

“Zhao Xueyin continued, “You don’t have to come!” ”

Even though she was no longer the acting chief of the Shunxi Financial Group.

But she still had the right to fire a secretary!

“”You asked me not to come. I’m sorry, you really don’t have the qualifications,”Allie continued, “Miss Zhao, you should mind your own business.” ”

“After following ye Zhuo for a long time, Allie’s ears and eyes were also stained. ”

“With Ye Zhuo’s support, she was not afraid of Zhao Xueyin! ”

“Hearing this, Zhao Xueyin’s face turned white with anger. ”

Dog relying on his power!

This dog relying on his power!

Wait.

She would call the personnel department right now.

Zhao Xueyin took out her phone and dialed the personnel department’s number.

“The personnel manager’s voice came from the other side, “I’m sorry, Miss Zhao, you don’t have the authority to dismiss any of the financial group’s employees.” ”

PA —

Zhao Xueyin was so angry that she directly smashed her phone.

The secretaries in the secretarial room all cast puzzled gazes at Zhao Xueyin.

“What are you looking at!”Zhao Xueyin roared angrily.

Everyone hurriedly lowered their heads.

“Zhao Xueyin came to the bathroom and washed her cold face, trying to calm herself down. ”

“Just as the cold water touched her skin, she felt a tingling pain. ”

Zhao Xueyin frowned slightly and looked up at the mirror.

There was nothing unusual about her illness in the mirror. Only her cheeks were slightly red and itchy.

“Zhao Xueyin reached out and scratched her face. Immediately, a red pimple appeared on her cheeks. ”

Then the second pimple and the third pimple.

What was going on?

The pimple on her face had disappeared last night. Why did it grow back so quickly?

Zhao Xueyin washed her face with cold water again.

“Just like before, the cold water hurt her skin when it touched it. ”

Was there a problem with the tap water?

Zhao Xueyin didn’t think much about it and prepared to buy some ointment to apply it when she went back.

“After coming out of the bathroom, Zhao Xueyin didn’t go to the meeting room, but went to Father Zhao’s office. ”

“Seeing Zhao Xueyin coming over, father Zhao immediately asked, “How is it?” ”

“Zhao Xueyin shook her head. “Ye Zao has the evidence of his alibi. The time is almost up. Father, let’s go to the meeting first.” ”

Father Zhao narrowed his eyes. “No.”

Zhao Xueyin was stunned.

“Father Zhao continued, “Let’s not go. I want to see what earth-shattering things that little girl ye Zao Can Do!” ”

He was one of the three elders of the Shunxi Financial Group. He did not believe that ye Zao would dare to lay a hand on him.

“Moreover, half of the board of directors were his people. Even if ye Zao really did something to him next, he would not be able to get past the board of directors. ”

“Based on the current situation, this matter could only be delayed for now. ”

“When the heat was gone, everything would be calm. ”

It was just a cat.

Ten minutes passed very quickly.

Ye Zhuo arrived at the meeting room on time.

All the directors had arrived.

“Elder Zhao and Zhao Xueyin haven’t arrived yet?”Ye Zhuo turned to ally. “Didn’t I ask you to inform them that the meeting will start in ten minutes?”

“Ally said, “Chief Ye, I’ve informed them.” ”

“”Since they’ve already been informed, then whether they come or not will be their business.”Ye Zhuo continued, “I’m sure all the directors have already seen the News at noon?” ”

“”They have.”Once these words were said, all the directors discussed animatedly. ”

“Actually, the directors of Shunxi Financial Group had already reached the age of retirement and usually did not pay much attention to the social news. ”

“This time, it was because the cat abuse incident had a huge impact on Shunxi Financial Group! ”

“Ye Zhuo threw the documents onto the conference table, then, he said, “Up until now, our Shunxi Financial Group’s shares have already fallen by 1% . If we don’t give the public an explanation, the losses that this incident will bring to our financial group will be unimaginable.” ”

“Yeah! This matter is indeed troublesome!”

“”This Xueyin, he really doesn’t know the gravity of the situation...” ”

“What should we do?”

“”Zha Zha, tell us what to do about this matter!”Elder Zhang stood up from his office chair. “We Old Fellows will listen to you!” ”
