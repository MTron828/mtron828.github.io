Translator: 549690339

“After changing his clothes, Ye Zhuo opened the door and saw Cen Shaoqing walking out of the room. ”

Cen Shaoqing also changed into the unique clothing of the grassland.

He was very different from his usual plain and long clothes.

“He was dressed in black silk with embroidered edges. A wide belt was tied around his waist, outlining his perfect figure. A small machete hung from the belt. ”

“He was originally very tall, and at this moment, his long legs appeared even more straight and long. ”

Noble and elegant.

“Black was a very mysterious color. When it was worn on Cen Shaoqing’s body, it appeared even more noble and elegant. It was cold and exuded a domineering aura unique to a prairie man. ”

“It had always been clothes that suited people, but when it came to him, it became a human shirt. ”

She looked at him and was stunned.

He looked at her and was also stunned.

“Their eyes met, and in the blink of an eye, they could see the look of surprise in each other’s eyes. ”

“”Not bad.”In a moment, ye Zhuo withdrew his gaze and walked to his side. He turned around twice and said, “It looks quite like it.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing curled his lips slightly. “Thank you for your praise, leader.” ”

“Ye Zhuo said, “I praised you, but you don’t even know how to praise me?” ”

“Is there a need to praise the most beautiful woman in the world?”Cen Shaoqing raised his eyebrows and asked.

Cen Shaoqing was a little regretful that he had agreed to let ye Zao stay on the Prairie for the New Year. She was too outstanding. He just wanted to find a pocket and hide her so that no one would see her.

“”Young Man, you have a future.”Ye Zao patted Cen Shaoqing’s shoulder. “Let’s go. Yueyue is already waiting for us in the restaurant.” ”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and followed ye Zhuo’s footsteps.

“Li Yueyue was in the restaurant. When she saw Cen Shaoqing and ye Zhuo coming over, she smiled and said, “Big Zouzhuo, you guys are here! Come and eat. The ceremony will begin in a while.” ”

“”Okay.”Ye Zhuo said, “By the way, what do you want to eat in the morning?” ”

“Li Yueyue said, “According to the rules of our grassland, we have to eat glutinous rice balls this morning. It means that we will be together all year round. However, this is an old idea. “My mom is afraid that you guys won’t be able to get used to our tangyuan, so she even prepared porridge and fried dough sticks.” ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “I really like eating tangyuan. What About You, Cen Shaoqing?” ”

“As long as it was sweet, Ye Zhuo would like to eat it. Tangyuan was no exception. ”

“”I’m fine with it,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“Ye Zhuo said, “Then let’s both eat tangyuan.” ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Okay.”

The servant brought the tangyuan over.

“Unlike the Beijing tangyuan, the tangyuan on the grassland was very big. There were only two of them in a bowl. ”

“It was round and very cute. Ye Zao loved eating tangyuan stuffed with sugar and sesame. When he took a bite, he was stunned. ”

This tangyuan was not stuffed with sugar and sesame!

“It was fine if it was not stuffed with sesame, but it was actually spicy beef flavor! ”

“This was the first time ye Zao had eaten tangyuan with this flavor, and he wasn’t used to it. ”

“In her opinion, tangyuan should be sweet. Spicy tangyuan was really hard to eat. ” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“With the thought that he couldn’t waste it, ye Zao ate up the entire tangyuan. Then, he silently handed the remaining tangyuan to Cen Shaoqing. “Here, have these.” ”

“You’re not eating?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“”I’m not used to eating spicy beef,”ye Zao said. ”

“Cen Shaoqing took the bowl. “Alright, then give it to me.” ”

“Ever since he was with Cen Shaoqing, everything that ye Zao didn’t eat had been taken care of by Cen Shaoqing. ”

The interaction between the two made Li Yueyue look envious. “Big Zao Zao.”

“Oh?”Ye Zao looked back at her.

“Li Yueyue continued, “I also want to find a boyfriend who can take care of all the things I don’t eat.” ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Go ahead.” ”

“I can’t find one...”

“Li Yueyue was not interested in finding a boyfriend before. After a long time, she finally became interested and found a scumbag like Ouyang Nai. ”

“As a result, Li Yueyue now had a shadow over the matter of finding a boyfriend! ”

What if she met someone unkind and met another person like Ouyang Nai?

“”Don’t be discouraged.”Ye Zhuo patted Li Yueyue’s shoulder. “You’re just not fated yet. When Fate Comes, you won’t be able to stop it.” ”

“Really.”Li Yueyue raised her head and looked at Ye Zhuo.

“Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “By the way, are you completely done chatting with Lin Weiwei Now?” ”

“”I’m not chatting anymore,”Li Yueyue said. ”

Lin Weiwei was too straightforward. Li Yueyue couldn’t hold it in anymore.

Ye Zao nodded again.

“”Zao Zao, you won’t be angry, right?”Li Yueyue looked at ye Zao. ”

“Why would I be angry?”Ye Zao felt a little puzzled.

“Li Yueyue said, “Isn’t Lin Weiwei your good friend?” ”
