“Thank you.”Feng Xianxian raised her head and thanked her.

Feng Xianxian was supported by a servant as she limped into the ward.

Old Lady Lin still did not have a good expression on Feng Xianxian’s face. “What do you want to say? Speak!”

“Feng Xianxian released the servant’s hand and knelt in front of old lady Lin’s bed, her voice dripping with tears, “Grandma, I know you hate me and my mother! But I didn’t know that my mother had done so many wrong things. If I had known, I would have stopped her...” ”

“”Even if it was my life, I would have stopped her!” ”

“”But I didn’t know, I really didn’t know!” ”

“Old Lady Lin looked at Feng Xianxian, who was crying so hard, and she couldn’t bear it anymore. ”

But she had to hold it in.

“After all, Feng Qianhua had done so many wrong things! ”

“”My mother deserves to go to jail. I Won’t come and Beg for your forgiveness on her behalf! I just want to stand in front of you and apologize to you personally! I’m sorry! Grandma, I didn’t protect you well! You’ve always treated me as your own granddaughter, but I’ve disappointed you! I’m not a good granddaughter!” ”

“”Grandma, I’ll Call You Grandma one last time. Thank you for taking care of me for so many years, and thank you for treating me like your own granddaughter!” ”

“At the last sentence, Feng Xianxian knelt on the ground and kowtowed. ”

“After kowtowing, Feng Xianxian stood up from the ground. “Goodbye, Old Lady!” ”

“Looking at Feng Xianxian’s back view as she turned to leave, Old Lady Lin’s eyes turned red. ”

The child was a good child.

It was a pity that she did not meet a good mother.

Sigh!

“Old Lady Lin wanted to call out to Feng Xianxian, but her voice was stuck in her throat and could not come out. ”

Feng Qianhua had just done such a thing.

She could not face Feng Xianxian now.

Feng Xianxian returned to the Feng family.

The Feng family had already received the news.

And the scandals that Feng Qianhua had done were also known by everyone in the circle.

Old Madam Feng was extremely angry.

She was originally still dreaming that Feng Qianhua could marry into the Lin family.

“She didn’t expect that not only did Feng Qianhua not marry into the Lin family, but she even got into the police station! ”

Which wealthy family didn’t care about their reputation?

“After this incident, even her sons and grandsons would be implicated. ”

“Ever since the news of Feng Qianhua’s incident spread, the Feng Corporation’s stock price had plummeted. At this point, it had already dropped by several points! ”

“At this moment, when she saw Feng Xianxian walk in from outside, Old Madam Feng was furious. She immediately slapped Feng Xianxian. “Little Slut! You still have the face to come back!” ”

“Feng Xianxian had just received old madam Lin’s slap in the afternoon. At this moment, she was slapped by Old Madam Feng again. Her entire face was swollen beyond recognition. ”

What was even more laughable was that...

The Feng family members were all gloating at her. They had no intention of persuading Old Madam Feng.

Feng Xianxian’s gaze swept across everyone’s faces. She would forever remember this moment!

“Then, she would return it to them with interest! ”

“”Grandma, I’m Sorry.”Feng Xianxian looked at Old Madam Feng with tears in her eyes, “I don’t know what my mother did either. I’m also a victim... If you don’t want to see me, I can leave this place immediately. I Won’t give you any trouble...” ”

“Get lost! Get Lost Right Now!”Old Madam Feng pointed at the door.

Feng Qianhua had done such a thing. Feng Xianxian was Feng Qianhua’s daughter. Old Madam Feng couldn’t wait to tell the world that these two mother and daughter had nothing to do with the Feng family. How could she tolerate Feng Xianxian staying in the Feng Family?

Feng Xianxian covered her face. “Then I’ll go upstairs and pack my clothes first.”

“Old Madam Feng looked at her daughters-in-law. “Second daughter-in-law, you go with her.” ”

“Okay.”

The Feng family’s second daughter-in-law followed Feng Xianxian’s footsteps and mocked Feng Xianxian along the way.

Feng Xianxian held back the anger on her face and did not say a word.

“She would definitely return everything that she had suffered today to the Feng family, with interest! ”

“Feng Xianxian did not touch those expensive things. She only packed her own clothes and shoes, then left the Feng family. ”

“After leaving the Feng family villa, Feng Xianxian dragged her suitcase to the dormitory. ”

“It was Saturday, so there was no one in the dormitory. ”

Feng Xianxian sat in front of her desk and began to write a letter.

“After writing the letter, Feng Xianxian went to the bathroom and took a shower. She changed into her best clothes, sat in front of the mirror and put on some light makeup. Finally, she took out a brand-new fruit knife and cut her wrist without any hesitation. ” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“After that, she lay on the bed calmly and slowly closed her eyes. ”
