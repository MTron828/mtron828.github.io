[ i quite like doctor gu too. ]

[ those who mocked miracle doctor ye before probably regret it to death now. ]

[ that’s for sure! I would regret it too! ]

[ I’m a little curious about how beautiful that Miracle Doctor Ye is. ]

“[ you’re not alone upstairs, I’m also very curious! They also said that Miracle Doctor Ye isn’t old, but shouldn’t this kind of miracle doctor be at the level of a Professor? How many young professors are there? ] ”

“[ Miracle Doctor Ye can develop the YKA drug, which means that she is not an ordinary person. It is normal for her to be young! Can a god be like us ordinary people? Didn’t you see some prodigies enter junior high school at the age of seven? ] ”

“[ ye is really a very magical surname! I heard that this year’s top scorer in Yunjing’s College Entrance Examination has the surname Ye, and the popular online chess streamer is also called Ye. ] ”

“[ Miracle Doctor Ye is an existence that benefits all mankind. Don’t compare her to an online celebrity, okay? They are not from the same world, so don’t mess around! ] ”

“That afternoon, all the high-speed rail, plane, train, and bus tickets to yunjing from all over the world were sold out! ”

“There were also many people driving private cars to Yunjing, resulting in a long line of traffic on the Yunhai Highway leading to Yunjing. ”

The hospital was also surrounded by nearby residents.

“Country P, which claimed to be the world’s most advanced medical technology, sent ten experts to exchange experience with Gu dening overnight, hoping to bring this technology back to country P. ”

“Not only country P came, but also country L, country y... ”

“For a time, the first People’s Hospital in Yunjing became the gathering point for all the major medical experts in the world. ”

But Gu dening did not communicate with these experts immediately.

“According to statistics, there were more than three million new cancer patients in China every year. As a Chinese, she had to ensure that all the cancer patients in China were protected first! ”

...

“As the first cancer patient in the world to be cured, Zhao Pingting also received an interview from the reporter. ”

But Zhao Pingting refused the reporter’s interview and recommended Uncle Wang who received treatment at the same time as her to the reporter.

Uncle Wang recovered very well.

He welcomed the reporter’s arrival.

It was the old man’s first time on television and he was still a little excited.

“”Uncle Wang, as the world’s first batch of patients who have been cured of lung cancer, can you tell us about your treatment process?” ”

“”Treatment process?”Uncle Wang scratched his head, “I don’t know what to say about this process either. I just know that the medicine is not quite the same as our common medicine. It’s Green!”! “At that time, there were a total of five people in the ward I stayed in. There were two patients who refused treatment because they didn’t believe that the medicine could cure cancer! “After they found out that the three of us had recovered, the two of them regretted it so much!” ”

“Uncle Wang laughed happily. “Actually, let me tell you guys. My old life is no different from a picked-up one. I even bought a shroud! Who would have thought that I would recover in the end!” ”

“”Actually, the person I have to thank the most is Miracle Doctor Ye! When a young man is strong, the country is strong. Although Miracle Doctor Ye is not old, she is really capable!” ” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“At this point, uncle Wang bowed deeply in front of the camera. ”

The reporters still wanted to ask some questions about Miracle Doctor Ye.

But uncle Wang did not say much.

...

The internet was filled with hot searches about Miracle Doctor Ye.

“Ye Zhuo, who was the most involved, was sitting in front of the computer table, broadcasting the game live. She was extremely calm. ”

It was as if this matter had nothing to do with her.

“When Cen Shaoqing turned on the live stream, Ye Zhuo’s game had already started. It was too late to match her with the game. ”

She had never shown her face in a live stream.

She was wearing a white shirt.

The first button was unbuttoned.

“One could vaguely see the beautifully curved collarbone hidden under the collar. At this moment, the scene of climbing up with ye Zao that day suddenly appeared in front of Cen Shaoqing’s eyes. ”

“She was also wearing the same shirt. Following his line of sight, she saw the undulating softness. ”

Thinking of this.

Cen Shaoqing’s gaze turned hot. He silently chanted the clear heart mantra and immediately turned his gaze to her hand.

One hand pressed on the keyboard while the other pressed on the mouse.

“Her hand was very beautiful. Her fair and slender fingers pressed on the black keyboard, making it appear white and clear. It was especially pleasing to the eye. ”

Cen Shaoqing could not help but think of a poem:

A white wrist with a golden ring.

“A moment later, Cen Shaoqing picked up his phone and sent a gift out. ”

“Account: [ Miao Yin user 202106080126, sent out a peerless beauty * 10! ] ”

“At present, Cen Shaoqing’s account is firmly in first place on the fan list. ”

It left second and third place by several streets.
