“No.”Li hang shook his head.

“Li da long continued, “Then you have to work hard. Dad heard from your uncle Zhao today that little melon has already given birth to a second set!” ”

Little Melon was Li Hang’s childhood Playmate and was the same age as Li Hang.

“Li hang said in surprise, “So Fast?” ”

“After all, Little Melon was only 23 this year. ”

“Li Da long nodded. “Although it’s a little early for her to have a second child at this age, it’s just right for her to fall in love at this age. Hang Hang, if you don’t have a boyfriend, your uncle Hu’s family...” ”

“Before Li da long could finish his sentence, he was directly interrupted by Li Hang. “Dad, don’t say anymore. I don’t like Hu Shan! It’s impossible for me to be with him! Don’t randomly pick a couple!” ”

“Sure enough, the circle determined one’s horizon. ”

Li Da Long would always only know Hu Shan.

But how could Hu Shan be worthy of her?

“Hu Shan was an ordinary worker at the age of 23 this year. Other than having two houses in Beijing, her family was completely useless. ”

But what did the two houses in Beijing Mean?

Ouyang Cheng could own a large company that was about to go public at the age of 23!

“Compared to Ouyang Cheng, Hu Shan could not even compare to his little finger. ”

“Li Da long smiled and said, “Okay, okay, okay. It’s fine if you don’t like it. I Won’t say it again in the future. I just think that that kid from the Hu family is quite dependable and suitable for living.”Moreover, his financial condition was not bad, he was a person worth marrying. ”

“After saying that, Li da long continued, “Hang, Tell Daddy what kind of person you like. Daddy will pay attention to it for you! Besides your Uncle Hu, Daddy also has other childhood friends!” ”

It was still childhood friends!

“With Li da long like this, what kind of childhood friends could he know? ”

“Without waiting for Li Hang to speak, Zhou Cui Hua walked out of the bedroom, she said in an imposing manner, “Childhood friends! Other than introducing this kind of poor boy to our daughter, what else do you know! Do you really want our daughter to marry someone like you and live a life like mine? !” ”

Zhou cuihua had had enough of such a life! She would never let her daughter go through it again!

Li Dalong was stunned. “What’s wrong? What’s wrong with me growing up? which one of them doesn’t have a car and a house? I think they’re pretty good!” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“I’ve really had enough of you!”Zhou Cuihua picked up the pillow and threw it heavily on Li Dalong.

How did she end up marrying such a person! !

“”You B * Tch, what’s wrong with you!”Li Dalong was also angered by Zhou Cuihua. He stood up and said, “From the moment I entered the door, my nose was not my nose, and my eyes were not my eyes! Did you take the wrong medicine?” ”

“As he said that, Li Dalong tried his best to calm himself down. Zhou Cuihua was in menopause after all. ”

“It was not easy for a woman, and it was even harder for a woman in menopause. As a husband, he should be tolerant and understanding. ”

“At a time like this, he should not quarrel with Zhou Cui Hua. ”

“What’s wrong with me?”Zhou Cui Hua pointed at herself and was so angry that she laughed. “There is something wrong with me. My biggest problem is that I married you! Why would I marry a man like you!”

“Li Dalong also laughed. “What’s wrong with me? All these years, have I starved you or frozen you! I let you live in such a big house, but you have a problem living in it!” ”

“”What a joke! Do you think you are especially capable! Is having two houses considered capable? Li Dalong, you have never seen a truly capable man!”Zhou cuihua continued, “If I could go back to 25 years ago, I would never marry a man like you!” ”

“”Then who do you want to marry? Do you think you can still marry a diamond bachelor?”Dalong li continued, “Why don’t you look in the mirror and see what kind of person you are!” ”
