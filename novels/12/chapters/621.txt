“The housekeeper nodded. “Then, if you have nothing else to do, I’ll go and do my work first.””

“You go and do your work.”

Ye Zhuo continued to run.

The row of rooms behind the garden was the servant’s room.

“At this time, everyone was doing their jobs.”

“Ye Zhuo looked at the surveillance camera on the servant’s room and took out her phone from her pocket. A minute later, she put her phone back and put her hands in her pockets as she strolled into the servant’s room.”

“The Lin family manor was very large, covering an area of dozens of acres. Therefore, there were a lot of servants.”

“Since Aunt Zhang was old and her legs were inconvenient, and she was an elder of the Lin family, the Butler arranged a room on the first floor for her.”

The door was locked.

“However, this did not pose a problem to Ye Zhuo.”

Ye Zhuo took off the black hair clip on his head and removed the lock core just like that.

There were not many decorations in Zhang Sao’s room.

Ye Zao walked around the room.

“Finally, he pulled out two strands of hair on the number in front of the dressing table.”

“After putting the hair into a transparent self-sealing bag, ye Zao found another photo album in the drawer.”

Ye Zao flipped through a few pages and suddenly narrowed his eyes. His gaze was fixed on a photo of a small baby.

The baby was very small.

It looked to be about five to six months old.

The woman who was holding her looked to be about twenty years old. Zhang Sao’s figure could be seen between her brows.

“If he was not mistaken, this child was Feng Qianhua when she was young. The woman holding the child was Zhang Sao when she was young.”

Ye Zhuo took out his phone and took a photo of this photo.

He did all this.

Ye Zhuo came out of the maid’s room and went to the kitchen again.

This was not ye Zhuo’s first time in the kitchen. The chefs in the kitchen were very familiar with her and took the initiative to greet her.

“While ye Zhuo chatted with the chefs, he quietly added some ingredients to Old Mrs. Cen’s lunch.”

...

It was past eleven o’clock in the afternoon.

Feng Qianhua came punctually to deliver the health-preserving soup to Old Mrs. Lin.

“”Auntie Feng, are you here to deliver soup to my grandmother?”Ye Zao walked over from the other side.”

“Feng Qianhua nodded. “Zao Zao, where are you going?””

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “I’m here to visit my grandmother.””

Visit Old Lady Lin?

“Ye Zao had been back for so many days, when had he ever taken the initiative to visit Old Lady Lin?”

Could it be that ye Shu had realized the danger and intentionally made ye Zao come to please Old Lady Lin?

Feng Qianhua narrowed her eyes.

The two of them entered Old Lady Lin’s house together.

“When she saw Feng Qianhua, Auntie Zhang greeted her warmly, “Miss Qianhua!””

“Auntie Zhang.”

“When she saw ye Zhuo behind her, a strange look flashed across Auntie Zhang’s eyes. She smiled and said, “The eldest miss is here too!””

“Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Yes, I’m here to see my grandmother.””

“Aunt Zhang continued, “The old lady went to sleep at nine o’clock. She hasn’t woken up yet.””

“I see. Then I’ll go back first.”Ye Zao turned around and walked out of the door.

Feng Qianhua and Aunt Zhang walked into the house. “Has ye Zao been here in the past few days?”

Aunt Zhang shook her head. “No.”

Feng Qianhua narrowed her eyes. “Then what happened today?”

“Aunt Zhang said in a low voice, “Could it be that ye Shu can’t sit still anymore?””

“”It’s very possible,”Feng Qianhua continued, “Please help me be more careful in the next few days.””

The two of them talked as they walked in.

“When they arrived at Old Mrs. Lin’s bedroom, Feng Qianhua took out a bowl of health-preserving soup and waited for old Mrs. Lin to wake up and drink it.”

“Old Mrs. Lin slept for a while almost every morning. Usually, she would wake up not long after Feng Qianhua arrived.”

But today.

“The health-preserving soup was cold on the table, but Old Mrs. Lin was still asleep.”

“Feng Qianhua turned to look at Auntie Zhang. “Please heat up the health-preserving soup.”This was the Lin family. It was inconvenient for her to enter and leave the kitchen, so it was best for Auntie Zhang to go.”

“In the Lin family, Auntie Zhang was the person she trusted the most.”

“Okay.”Auntie Zhang nodded and walked toward the kitchen with the thermos bucket. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Ye Zao watched Aunt Zhang Walk into the kitchen with a faint smile on his face.

Ten minutes later.

“A young servant came over. “Miss, this is what you asked me to take.””

Ye Zao took the small glass bottle from the servant with both hands. “Thank you.”

“”Miss, you’re too kind.””

An hour later.

“Ye Zao appeared in a laboratory. “Hello, I’m looking for Gu De Ning.””

“The receptionist raised her head to look at ye Zao, her eyes flashing with surprise. “Do you have an appointment with Dr. Gu?””

“Ye Zao said, “Please tell her that my surname is Ye, and she will come out to see me.””

“The receptionist saw ye Zao’s refined temperament and was afraid of offending the noble, so she immediately called the internal line to inform Gu Dening. She didn’t dare to delay for even a second.”

Gu dening came out very quickly.

She was probably doing an experiment and was wearing a blue isolation suit.

“Miss Ye! I didn’t expect it to really be you!”Gu dening looked at ye Zao in surprise.

This was the first time ye Zao had looked for her since she came to Beijing.

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “I came here today because I have something to ask you for help.””

“Gu dening said, “Miss Ye, you’re too kind. It’s my duty to do things for you. If there’s anything you need me to do, just say it!””

Ye Zhuo handed the glass bottle to Gu deling. “Help me test the contents of this bottle of medicine.”
