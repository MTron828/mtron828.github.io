“Chapter 2175: 452: My Face Hurts. If I reveal the past, I will torture you! 1”

Translator: 549690339

Is the parent-child relationship not established?

“Zhao Dan was stunned for a moment, and her face turned pale. ”

How could her personal relationship with Ye Zhuo not be established?

No.

Impossible!

“She was clearly ye Zhuo’s biological mother. Other than her, who else could give birth to such an outstanding daughter. ”

Ye Zhuo’s achievements today were inextricably linked to her as a mother.

Could she have heard wrong?

Yes.

She must have heard wrong!

“Thinking of this, Zhao Dan looked up at the device and saw a line of words on the large screen. ”

[ the parent-child relationship is not established! ]

Zhao Dan was not the only one who was stunned.

“The other people present, as well as the audience watching the live broadcast, were also stunned. ”

What was going on?

“Zhao Dan kept saying that ye Zhuo was her daughter, but now, after the verification, their parent-child relationship was actually not established? ”

Could it really be that Zhao Dan was mistaken?

Ye Zhuo had nothing to do with her!

“Seeing that the situation was not in her favor, Zhao Dan narrowed his eyes and turned to look at Ye Zhuo, he said in a hoarse voice, “”Yue’er, I know that you hate me and don’t want to have anything to do with me, but you shouldn’t… … shouldn’t have tampered with the instrument … Yue’er, your father and I don’t have any other thoughts. We just want to confirm whether you are Yue’er… . .”” ”

“In the end, Zhao Dan directly sobbed. ”

Yezor must have done something to it!

“Otherwise, how could a parent-child relationship not work? ”

“There were many people in the audience of the court, and they were all talking about it. ”

“””If that’s the case, Yezao is too scary.”” ”

“””I don’t think it was tampered with, was it? Miss Ye and Lin Jincheng look alike to me.”” ”

“””Now that you mention it, they do look a little alike, but nothing is absolute.”” ”

“””I believe that a mother would never mistake her own child. Ye Zhuo must have tampered with the appraisal device in advance.”” ”

“””…”” ”

“Listening to the discussions around her, Zhao Dan heaved a sigh of relief. ”

She was now the People’s favorite.

So what if ye Zhuo had tampered with it? Could she appease the public’s anger?

On the bullet screen.

[ is the judge dead? Don’t you know how to test the instrument? ]

[ I’m so angry! She actually tampered with the instrument. How disgusting! ]

“[ ye Zao is after all the fiancée of the young master of Dongli, the famous Miss Ye. It should be very easy for her to do something in the appraisal, right? ] ”

[ what’s the use of having a judge? The judge will definitely stand on ye Zao’s side! ]

[ now it’s time to fight for the backing. I guess the judge will definitely be indifferent. ]

“[ there are so many people watching. If the judge is biased and cheats, we will all protest together! ] ”

“Ye Zhuo raised his eyes slightly and looked at Zhao Dan. His red lips parted slightly, “”I don’t know why Madam Man insists that I am the full moon princess. “”In fact, before the court session began, I had already investigated the cause of the incident back then. “”However, since everyone is questioning whether the equipment was tampered with, then before the truth is revealed, I’ll have to trouble the trial staff to check if the appraisal equipment was tampered with.”” ”

“Once these words were said, the discussion came to an abrupt end. ”

No one had expected that ye Zhuo would take the initiative to ask the trial staff to check the appraisal equipment.

A Gentleman is magnanimous.

Ye Zao used this idiom to its fullest.

“At this time, even Zhao Dan felt a little guilty. ”Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

What did ye Zao Mean?

She said that she had found out the truth. What Truth did she find?

“Also, at this time, ye Zao should have done everything possible to stop the trial staff from testing the instrument. ”

But Ye Zao took the initiative to invite him.

Zhao Dan turned to look at man Jiangshan.

“Like Zhao Dan, Man Jiangshan was also a little confused. ”

“Apart from confusion, he was also a little flustered. ”

The truth that ye Zao spoke of…

Could it be the truth that the full moon was lost back then?

It shouldn’t be.

Only they and Li Man knew what happened back then.

“Now that Li Man had long disappeared, even he and Zhao Dan couldn’t find her. ”

What could ye Zao find out?

Man Jiangshan tried his best to calm himself down.

“When she looked at man Xing again, she had never been nervous from the start. ”

“Even if she had determined that Zhao Dan and ye Zhuo were not biological mother and daughter, she would not be surprised. ”

“After all, Ye Zhuo was Miss Ye. ”

“For her to be able to sit in that position, it meant that her methods were brilliant. ”

Could the high and mighty miss ye be at the mercy of others?

“Therefore, it was within man Xing’s expectations that she had tampered with the apparatus. ”

“If ye Zhuo could deceive the world by doing this, this matter would end here. ”

“If she could not deceive the world, she would ask the court to come up and examine the machine and find that there was something wrong with it. As long as ye Zhuo refused to admit that she was the one who tampered with it, no one would be able to do anything to her. ”
