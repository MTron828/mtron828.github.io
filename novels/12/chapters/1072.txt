“Such a young girl, she probably doesn’t even understand the principle of a plane taking off. How could she develop an aircraft carrier? ”

This is simply a fantasy!

“For a moment, old NIE’s expression was very complicated. ”

“Ye Zao looked at Old Nie with a smile. “Hello, I’m Ye Zao. If you have any problems, just tell me.” ”

Tell Her?

Could she understand?

Old Nie was already fifty years old this year. What was there to talk about with a little girl?

It was a waste of time.

“Old Nie looked at Cen Jiang. “Team leader Cen Jiang, I’m sorry, Miss Ye! I suddenly feel a little uncomfortable in my stomach and I need to go to the bathroom.” ”

“Cen Jiang said, “Old nie, go quickly! I’ll talk to Little Ma, Little Liu, and the others.” ”

“Old Nie took off his helmet and walked toward the exit. As soon as he turned around, his expression changed. Anyone with a discerning eye could tell that old nie was in a bad mood. ”

“Old Nie was an old researcher in the base. Seeing him like this, the other research members passing by discussed animatedly. ”

“What’s wrong with old Nie?”

“I don’t know.”

“Did he get bullied in Miss Ye’s research group?”

“What’s going on? Old Nie joined Miss Ye’s research group too? Why didn’t I know?”

“”It’s all because of Cen Jiang!”! “But old nie wanted to join sister Xue’s laboratory. Who knew Cen Jiang would trick him into developing an aircraft carrier together? Looking at him now, it’s most likely that he has woken up!”! “It’s not too late to make amends. If only old nie could wake up earlier. Unfortunately, Sister Xue’s research room is already full!” ”

“DAMN! This old nie is too miserable!”

“”But this is also his own fault! He didn’t even use his brain to think. What is an aircraft carrier? If they really can successfully develop an aircraft carrier, wouldn’t miss ye become a national treasure?” ”

“”I heard from Cen Jiang that the aircraft carrier that miss ye developed can not only fly in space, but also successfully land on the eight planets of the Solar System within a day!” ”

“”F * ck! Is this for real? ! Land on the eight planets? If we can really land on the eight planets within a day, won’t the entire Solar System become China’s?”There were so many precious resources in the Solar System! If these resources could be transported back to Earth, wouldn’t China surpass country C and become the number one country in the world? ! ”

Just thinking about it made him extremely excited!

“That person continued, “No way! I want to join Miss Ye’s Ye’s research group too!” ”

“The eight planets of the Solar System?”A bespectacled middle-aged man in the crowd sneered. “Do you know what is the furthest planet from Earth among the eight planets?”

“Of course it’s Neptune!”

“The middle-aged man continued, “Then do you know how many kilometers Neptune is from Earth?” ”

“This time, no one could answer. ”

This involved everyone’s blind spot.

“Although everyone was a research member, who would study the distance between Neptune and Earth for no reason? ”

“The middle-aged man continued, “Neptune is 4.35 billion kilometers from Earth!” ”

“At this point, he paused, then, he continued, “Do you know what 4.35 billion kilometers is? Based on the current speed of the world’s fastest aircraft, 300 kilometers per year, it would take nearly 200 kilometers to reach Neptune!” ”

“As soon as he said this, a gasp came from the crowd. ”

200 years?

This was too terrifying!

“What if Miss ye designs an aircraft carrier that can reach the speed of light?”

“Hearing that, the middle-aged man’s face was filled with a disdainful smile, “Speed of light? It’s not that I’ve underestimated Miss Ye, but with Miss Ye’s current ability, it’s still impossible to develop an aircraft carrier! You still have delusions of reaching the speed of light? Isn’t this a Dream?”Speaking up to this point.., the middle-aged man patted the man’s shoulder and said meaningfully, “It’s better for young people to keep their feet on the ground and dream less!” ”

“Old Nie’s mood was not very good to begin with, so when he heard these words, his mood became even worse. He could not help but sigh. ”

It was all his fault for being obsessed!

“The middle-aged man raised his head to look at old nie, he smiled and said, “Old NIE, ah! You should also take good care of your disciple! Oh! But you can’t completely blame your disciple. As the saying goes, ‘the best is not the best’. With a good master like you around, how good can your disciple be?” ”

“Yu Zifei said angrily, “Don’t you dare talk about my master like that! Miss Ye will definitely lead my master and the others to develop an aircraft carrier and land on Neptune!” ”

“The middle-aged man laughed out loud, “The carbon content on Neptune is as high as 10% , the pressure is 11 million times that of Earth, and the temperature is as high as 4,000 degrees Celsius. Methane and ammonia ice will become hot liquids under the immense pressure, and carbon atoms will also start to crystallize into diamonds. If your miss ye can really bring it to land on Neptune, then the expensive diamonds won’t be a big deal. When that time comes, our China will not only become a diamond country, but also realize diamond freedom! I wish Miss Ye an early completion of the aircraft carrier program!” ”
