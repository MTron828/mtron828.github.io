Translator: 549690339

“Looking at Feng Qianxian’s departing figure, Old Lady Lin’s eyes were filled with heartache. ”

“After a long while, Old Lady Lin raised her head to look at Lin Qingxuan. “Qianxian is just a child who doesn’t know anything. Do you have to treat her like this?” ”

“Lin Qingxuan said, “Mom, you know how to feel sorry for her. Why Don’t you know how to feel sorry for your own granddaughter! How much suffering did Zhonghua suffer because of Feng Qianhua?” ” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“At the mention of Ye Zhuoluo, old Mrs. Lin’s expression changed. ”

Didn’t she feel sorry for Ye Zhuoluo?

She even apologized to Ye Zhuoluo personally!

But Ye Zhuoluo didn’t appreciate it at all!

“I don’t want to talk so much nonsense with you. Let’s go back.”

Lin Qingxuan shook her head helplessly and followed Old Mrs. Lin’s footsteps.

“In the car, Old Mrs. Lin took the initiative to care about Lin Qingxuan’s important matters. “Qingxuan, you said earlier that you would bring people back to see me. When are you going to bring them back?” ”

“You’re not going to set me up with Jiang Suran Anymore?”Lin Qingxuan teased.

“Old Lady Lin rolled her eyes at Lin Qingxuan. “You really want to see your mother make a fool of herself, don’t you?” ”

Feng Qianhua was the one who introduced Jiang Suran to Lin Qingxuan.

“At this moment, Old Lady Lin obviously didn’t want to let Jiang Suran enter the Lin family’s front door again. ”

At this moment.

Chi!

The sound of an emergency brake was heard in the air.

“What happened?”

Madam Lin asked nervously.

Lin Qingxuan’s face was slightly pale. She hurriedly pushed the door open and got out of the car. “I think I bumped into someone!”

Madam Lin also got out of the car.

“The person who was knocked down was an old lady with white hair. From her back view, she was already very old. However, when Lin Qingxuan walked over, she realized that this person was not very old. ”

He was at most in his early sixties.

“Lin Qingxuan quickly helped her up. “Auntie, I’m sorry! I didn’t see you just now! Are You Alright?” ”

“I’m fine.”The old lady shook her head.

“Old Lady Lin walked over from the car. When she saw the old lady’s face clearly, she frowned slightly. “Qingxuan, if she’s Alright, let’s Go!” ”

“Lin Qingxuan was a little worried. “Auntie, why don’t I send you to the hospital to have a look?” ”

“It’s really fine. There’s no need to go to the hospital.”The old man waved his hand and walked to the side of the road.

“Lin Qingxuan looked at the old man’s back, ”

“old Lady Lin also urged from behind, “Qingxuan! What are you still standing there for?” ”

Lin Qingxuan only walked back after the old man’s back completely disappeared into the crowd.

“Old Lady Lin said unhappily, “Why are you wasting your time with that kind of person?” ”

“”Mother, do you know that Auntie Just Now?” ”

Old Mrs. Lin nodded.

“The person just now was called ye Langhua, and she was Xi Muwen’s wife. ”

“More than forty years ago, the Ye family was also a big family in the capital. Ye Langhua was the only daughter of the Ye family’s elder, so ye Langhua naturally became the heir of the Ye family. ”

“When ye Langhua reached the marriageable age, she recruited her son-in-law, Xi Muwen, to visit her. ”

“At first, their lives were rather happy. After they got married, ye Langhua even gave Xi Muwen a daughter. ”

“Unfortunately, things did not go according to plan. More than 30 years ago, Ye Langhua’s only biological daughter went missing for half a month and completely destroyed ye Langhua. She began to search for her daughter day and night. ”

“At this time, Xi Muwen took advantage of the situation to change the Ye group into Xi Corporation, and the Ye family became the Xi family. ”

Xi Muwen even married a petite wife who was twenty years younger than him.

Ye Langhua became the most redundant person in the Ye family.

“In Old Mrs. Lin’s eyes, Ye Langhua was a useless piece of trash. She even lost her own child! ”

“Besides, wasn’t it just a child? ”

“If she lost it, she could just have another child! ”

But Ye Langhua was so stubborn!

“In the end, she gave Xi Muwen the wedding dress for nothing. ”

“So, the Old Lady Lin Most looked down on is ye Langhua, think she is self-inflicted. ”
