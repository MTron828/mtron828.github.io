Translator: 549690339

“Feng Ying lived abroad all year round and was a fashion designer. After Feng Qi defected, Feng Ying entered the International Fashion Department! ”

A discerning person could tell at a glance what was going on inside.

“If it weren’t for Feng Qi, with Feng Ying’s qualifications, she definitely wouldn’t have been able to enter the international fashion department. ”

“”I won’t say anything else...”after saying that, the old lady sighed and took out the wooden box from the bag. “Miss Ye, I came here today to give this to you.” ”

“What is this?”Ye Zhuo asked curiously.

“The old lady opened the lid of the wooden box. Just as she opened the lid, a dazzling light poured out from it. “This is the family heirloom of our Feng family.” ”

Family Heirloom?

“Since it was a family heirloom, the old lady should leave it to her descendants. ”

Leave it to her for what?

Ye Zhuo suddenly did not understand the old lady’s intentions.

“After saying this, the old lady continued, “This piece of jade has been passed down in our Feng family for nearly a hundred years. I’m already old and might leave one day. So, Miss Ye, I’ll hand it over to you now.” ”

This was the purpose of the old lady’s visit.

“Ye Zhuo stood up. “Old Lady, I can’t accept such a valuable thing.” ”

A family heirloom represented the inheritance of a family. How could she accept such an item.

“”Miss Ye, don’t be in a hurry to reject it. Listen to Me First.”The old lady looked at Ye Zhuo and spoke slowly, as if she was chatting with her family. As they chatted, tears almost burst out of her eyes, “Half a month ago, my granddaughter, Feng Ying, returned. Feng Ying was a child that I raised by myself. Her mother was busy working all day at that time. She was only four months old, and she was already handed over to me to take care of. A child of four months old, and she was still so young. Every night, I had to get up and feed her milk powder... “...”. “...” ”

“”When she was young, Feng Ying was really cute and very smart. The three-star student awards were plastered all over the wall. “When I was young, she was very close to me. For six years in primary school and three years in junior high school, I personally sent her to and from school. “When I was in high school, Feng Qi said that he wanted to train the child’s autonomy, so he sent her to a boarding school. “After she went to boarding school, Feng Ying’s entire personality changed. After she graduated from university, she went abroad to study. Once she went abroad, it was a full ten years. During these ten years, other than voice, video, and phone calls, I had almost no contact with her ”

“”God knows, half a month ago, when I saw Feng Ying coming back from outside the door, I was so happy. I thought, this child has a grandmother in her heart. She is different from her mother.” ”

“At this point, the old lady took out a tissue to wipe her tears, then, she said, “Until this morning, I heard her talking on the phone with someone else, only then did I know her real purpose of coming back to China this time! “She didn’t come here to show her filial piety and reunite with me. She came here for Suyu! “I heard her calling Tina on the other end of the phone. Before Feng Qi defected, she also talked to Tina on the phone ”

“”It was Tina who asked her to go back to China and take away suyu! “Rather than asking Feng Ying to give the Suyu to C nation, it would be better to let the Suyu play its true role! “Tina is from the research base of C Nation. She must have wanted the Suyu because it contained an unspeakable secret. “Therefore, I want to hand the jade over to you. Take it as my last contribution to China before I Die! “No matter what, I can not stand by and watch her give the thing that belongs to US Chinese to a bunch of pirates!” ”

“The old lady stood up and picked up the jade with both hands. She handed it to ye zhuo, “So, Miss Ye, please do not reject me!” ”

“Although the old lady was old, her patriotic heart was still young and active! ”

“No matter what, she would never betray her country. ” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“She wanted to atone for her sins in the twilight of her life, for Feng Qi and her daughter’s sins! ”

“The old lady’s words were moving from the bottom of her heart. Her patriotic fervor was even more admirable. Ye Zhuo stood up and took the wooden box from the old lady with both hands, “Don’t worry, Old Lady. We will definitely find out the value of the plain jade. We will not let you down.” ”

“Thank you.”The old lady wiped her tears.

“”I should be the one thanking you. Thank you for your deep sense of justice.”Ye Zhuo continued, “Your patriotism is worth learning from every Chinese.” ”

“The old lady looked at Ye Zhuo, her eyes full of emotion. ”

“The little girl in front of her was a few years younger than Feng Ying, but her words and actions were a few streets ahead of Feng Ying. ”

“If Feng Ying could be half as good as ye Zao, she would not be like this. ”
