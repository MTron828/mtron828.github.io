East Wing.

Ye Shu was playing mahjong with her three sisters-in-law in the living room downstairs.

“The four of them got along very well, chatting and laughing.”

“Lin Jincheng smiled and walked over. “Sister-in-law, sister-in-law, sister-in-law, sister-in-law, sister-in-law, sister-in-law. Do you want some water? I’ll go get some for you.””

Yang Wenyin glanced at Lin Jincheng. “There’s no need for water. Go get us some melon seeds and dried fruits.”

“Okay.”

Lin Jincheng went upstairs to get some food.

“Zhang Zhenzhen looked at ye Shu and said, “Jincheng has a good temper. If it were our husband, he would have overturned the Mahjong Table!””

“Yang Wenyin said, “Don’t mention it. My husband is the same. It’s annoying to see him!””

“Wu Mei took out a card and said with a smile, “That’s why none of our sisters-in-law’s lives are as good as Ah Shu’s. Not only does she have a good husband, but she also has a pair of outstanding children.””

“In the eyes of these three people, Ye Shu was simply a winner in life.”

“In their families, not only did they not have a daughter, but they did not even have a granddaughter.”

“Ye Shu touched a card and said somewhat embarrassedly, “I won.””

“You won again?”Zhang Zhenzhen was extremely surprised.

“One had to know that ever since ye Shu sat at the Mahjong table, she had been winning non-stop, as if she was possessed by a gambling god.”

Ye Shu was also in disbelief. She had never known that she had such good luck in playing mahjong.

“”Ah Shu, you have to treat us to dinner tomorrow!””

“Okay.”

“Not long after, Lin Jincheng went downstairs with melon seeds, dried fruits, and other snacks.”

In the western courtyard.

“Old Lady Lin asked Lin Qingxuan to stay and talk. Her eyes were slightly red as she said, “Qingxuan, Mom has let you down for what happened to Zhao shuning...”she had never done anything wrong in her life. This was the only thing.”

“Lin Qingxuan didn’t quite understand Old Mrs. Lin’s intention. She raised her head and said, “The matter has passed.””

“”Fourth brother,”old Mrs. Lin carefully chose her words in her mind. “You’re not young anymore. Have you ever thought about finding someone else? I feel sorry for you when I see you alone.””

“”Mom, I don’t have any thoughts about this for the time being.”Lin Qingxuan shook his head.”

It had only been half a month since the incident between him and Zhao shuning. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“At the moment, he didn’t have the mood to think about anything else.”

“”But you’re already so old,”old Mrs. Lin continued, “If you were twenty or thirty years old, I definitely wouldn’t rush you. You have to know that you’re already forty-two years old, and your elder brother is ten years older than you. Duan Duan is already five years old this year.””

“The fifty-two-year-old eldest son of the Lin family already had a five-year-old grandson, but the forty-two-year-old Lin Qingxuan still didn’t have a son or daughter.”

“Old Mrs. Lin had thought that it was because Lin Qingxuan couldn’t have children, so she wasn’t anxious at all.”

But it was different now.

“Lin Qingxuan didn’t have any problems at all. Of course, it was better to find a wife early and have children.”

“”Mom, I don’t want to get married just to have a child.”Lin Qingxuan continued, “This is not responsible for the woman, but also for myself.””

“Although he was over forty years old, Lin Qingxuan still did not want to make do.”

He had already experienced such a marriage once.

“For the rest of his life, he wanted to live according to his own ideas.”

“”But isn’t life about getting married and having children?”Old Lady Lin continued, “If you marry a wife and don’t have children, what are you going to marry her for? To be a decoration?””

Wasn’t the mission of a woman to get married and have children?

Old Lady Lin didn’t understand Lin Qingxuan’s thoughts.

“Lin Qingxuan frowned slightly. “I can’t make sense of it with you. Anyway, I don’t want to find her yet.””

“Seeing Lin Qingxuan like this, Old Lady Lin Sighed, “Qingxuan, I know you’re still blaming me! But isn’t it for your own good? “If I knew that Zhao shuning was that kind of snake-hearted B * tch, I wouldn’t have let her marry into our Lin family no matter what! “Everyone has their own blind spots. Can’t you forgive me this time?””

The poor hearts of all parents.

Why couldn’t Lin Qingxuan tolerate her more?

“”Mom, that matter has already passed. It’s meaningless to bring up the past again,”Lin Qingxuan continued, “I don’t want to look for her now. It’s my own problem. It has nothing to do with you.””

“Old Mrs. Lin continued, “There’s a pretty good girl in Qianhua. She’s 38 years old and unmarried. I heard that she even went to female Durban. Her character and character are very good. Do you want me to arrange for you to meet her?””

Female Durban?

Lin Qingxuan even thought that she was listening to nonsense!

What era was it now? There was actually someone who brought up this kind of old feudalism where the three followed the four virtues and trampled on women!

“”No, we are not suitable.”Lin Qingxuan directly refused.”
