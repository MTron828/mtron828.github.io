Translator: 549690339

Different Heights lead to different understanding of things.

“Although Whitey had its own four-dimensional, it was a robot after all. ”

Its considerations were very different from that of humans.

“For example, in daily life, humans were most concerned about food, clothing, shelter, and transportation. ”

Whitey was most worried about whether the electricity would be used or not.

“If ye Zhuo had desserts, he would be able to settle everything. ”

“If Little White had electricity, he would be able to settle everything. ”

“When he heard the last sentence, little white became anxious. “If you speak, then speak. Why are you still scolding people!” ”

“When did I scold you?”Ye Zhuo was stunned.

“Little White said, “Just now, you scolded me for Not Being Human!” ”

Ye Zhuo chuckled. “Then are you human?”

“”I, I...”Little White sighed. “Alright, I am indeed not human.” ”

“Ye Zhuo patted Little White’s head. “Alright, Doggy, don’t think too much. You just have to remember that the new year will bring you happiness and happiness.” ”

“Okay.”Little White nodded.

“On the first day of the new year, as usual, Ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing went to a nearby temple to burn incense and pray to Buddha. ”

There were many people who came to burn incense and pray to Buddha.

“Dressed in a wine-red coat, she stood out particularly among the crowd. Her every frown and smile was like a painting as she walked over. ”

The man standing next to her was equally eye-catching.

“He was dressed in a moon-white long gown with a string of bright red Buddhist beads in his hand, which happened to match the color of her clothes. ”

These two people made passersby cast sidelong glances at them.

“”Miss Ye.”At this moment, a pleasant male voice sounded behind her. ”

Ye Zao looked back slightly and saw a handsome face. Ye Zao was stunned for a moment before he remembered that this person was... ... Jin Ruyu.

“Long time no see.”

“Jin Ruyu nodded. “Long time no see. Miss Ye, let me introduce you. This is my wife, Ming Yao.” ”

“In the past two years, Jin Ruyu had already married Ming Yao. ”

“Hearing this news, ye Zao was a little surprised. ”

“After all, Jin Ruyu had loved Zhao Xueyin to the death back then, unable to extricate herself. ”

“Ming Yao gracefully extended her hand to ye Zao. “Hello, Miss Ye.” ”

“Hello.”Ye Zao shook her hand.

“After seeing Ming Yao, the wariness in Cen Shaoqing’s eyes disappeared a little. ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “This is my boyfriend, Cen Shaoqing.” ”

“Jin Ruyu shook hands with Cen Shaoqing. “CEN fifth master, I’ve heard a lot about you.” ”

“”Nice to meet you,”Cen Shaoqing said concisely. ”

“Jin ruyu continued, “Miss Ye, take your time with CEN fifth master. We’ll go over there. Let’s meet again when we have time.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

Jin Ruyu held Ming Yao’s hand and walked to the other side.

A few minutes later.

“Ming Yao let go of Jin Ruyu’s hand and continued, “Was that chief ye from Shunxi Financial Group just now?” ”

“Yes.”Jin Ruyu nodded.

Ming Yao turned around and looked in the direction where ye Zao had disappeared. “She’s really beautiful! You’re also blind. Why did you have to go to that Zhao Guy when there’s such a beauty in front of you!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Ming Yao was a rare beauty, but in front of ye Zao, she still felt inferior, ”

because ye Zao was really too good-looking!

“”Don’t talk nonsense. He has a boyfriend,”Jin Ruyu said. ”

“Ming Yao smiled and said, “I was just saying.” ”

“After saying that, Ming Yao continued, “By the way, since Zhao Xueyin, have you not liked anyone else?” ”

“”No,”Jin Ruyu said. ”

“Ming Yao Glanced at Jin Ruyu and said, “It’s okay even if you like them. After all, we’re just a contract marriage. We agreed that we wouldn’t interfere with each other.” ”

That’s right.

The two of them were only getting married for the sake of getting married. They had signed a contract before they got married.

“Jin ruyu said, “So, do you think I’ve ever bothered you?” ”

“”The point is that I’ve never done anything unfaithful,”Ming Yao continued, “Jin Ruyu, actually, you’re quite good-looking too. Why don’t we fake it and do it for real! “It just so happens that your father and my parents are both urging us to have children.” ”

Ming Yao had been so annoyed recently.

Jin Ruyu’s father was still alright.

“Especially her parents, who had been urging her to have children. ”

“Jin Ruyu was stunned for a moment, as though she didn’t expect Ming Yao to say this. ”

“Before he could answer, Ming Yao burst out laughing and said, “I was joking with you! You actually took it seriously!” ”

“Jin Ruyu looked at her. “Three years, three years later, if you still haven’t met your true love, let’s have a child.” ”

“This time, it was Ming Yao’s turn to be stunned. ”

“After a long while, Ming Yao finally reacted. “What... What did you say?” ”
