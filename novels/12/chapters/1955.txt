Translator: 549690339

“No matter what, he ziteng would always give Xu Yao whatever she wanted. ”

“Moreover, Xu Yao was now pregnant with his child. ”

“When he ziteng heard Xu Yao say that she wanted to drink ji rui milk tea, he ziteng immediately nodded and said, “Okay, I’ll buy it for you right away.” ”

“Seeing this, Xu Yao said again, “Why don’t We Forget It? Ji Rui milk tea is so far away from our house, I Won’t drink it.” ”

“How can you not drink it? I’ll go buy it for you right away.”He Ziteng took the car keys and went to buy milk tea for Xu Yao.

“Seeing that he ziteng had left the house, Xu Yao sent the servant away and sent a message to Mi Chen. ”

“After Mi Chen received Xu Yao’s message, she immediately went to he ziteng’s apartment. ”

“Over here, because he was in a hurry to buy milk tea for Xu Yao, he ziteng drove very quickly. ”

“After all, Xu Yao was pregnant. ”

Pregnant women were different from ordinary people. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“If a pregnant woman wanted to eat something, she had to eat it immediately. ”

He Ziteng drove from 90 to 210.

“At this moment, a red car suddenly passed by from the opposite side of the road. ”

“He ziteng frowned slightly and immediately slowed down the brakes. At this moment, he realized that the brakes had failed! ”

What should he do?

What should he do now!

“Cold Sweat broke out on he ziteng’s face. Seeing that he was about to crash into the red car, he ziteng immediately turned the steering wheel. ”

Bang!

The car crashed into the green belt at the side.

The four wheels were facing the sky.

Fresh blood spread from the ground.

...

“On the other side, Xu Yao was sitting in Mi Chen’s arms, whispering to him. ”

“After a while, Xu Yao continued, “Alright, get ready to leave. It’s almost time. He ziteng will be back soon.” ”

“”Back?”Hearing this, Mi Chen curled her lips. “I’m afraid he ziteng will never come back!” ”

“Xu Yao was stunned. She stood up and asked, “What do you mean?” ”

“Mi Chen looked at her watch. “According to the time, the car has already been destroyed.” ”

That’s right.

All of this was a trap set by Mi Chen.

“From the last time Mi Chen helped he ziteng drive them to the hospital, he had tampered with He ziteng’s car. ”

“Once he ziteng’s speed exceeded 210 km/h, the brakes would fail. ”

“Xu Yao was in a hurry to drink milk tea. Furthermore, there wasn’t much traffic on the way to Ji Rui milk tea, so he ziteng would definitely be speeding. ”

“In that case, there would definitely be a car accident! ”

The car would be destroyed and people would die!

“Hearing this, Xu Yao’s face turned pale. “Mi Chen, what did you do to He Ziteng?” ”

“Mi Chen said, “I just wanted him to disappear from this world.” ”

“”Are you crazy!”Xu Yao said angrily, “Who told you to do this? Who told you to touch he ziteng!” ”

“Everything she did was for the sake of marrying he ziteng. If he ziteng died, who would she marry? ”

This meant that all her previous efforts would be in vain.

No.

Xu Yao was unwilling.

“”I’m not crazy.”Mi Chen looked at Xu Yao and said, “Yaoyao, I’m doing this for your own good!” ”

“”For my own good? For my own good, why did you kill he ziteng? !”Xu Yao continued, “If anything happens to he ziteng, I’m not done with you!” ”

“Mi Chen placed her hands on Xu Yao’s shoulders and said, “Yaoyao, calm down and listen to me slowly.” ”

“Speak.”She wanted to see what Mi Chen could say.

“Mi Chen looked at Xu Yao and analyzed, “He ziteng is the only son of the He family. Now that you have his child, if anything happens to he ziteng, the child in your stomach will be the only heir of the He family...” ”

“When she heard this, Xu Yao’s eyes instantly lit up. ”

Yes.

Mi Chen was right.

“She was pregnant with he ziteng’s child. In the future, she would be the living ancestor of the He family. What was she afraid of? ”

“Mi Chen continued, “Yaoyao, once he ziteng dies, not only can you openly become a member of the He family, but you can also be with me without any worries. Isn’t this the best of both worlds?” ”

“Xu Yao’s lips curled up slightly. She continued, “Are you sure that he ziteng will definitely die?” ”

It had to be said that Mi Chen’s plan was very thorough.

He had considered every aspect.

“”Even if he doesn’t die, he’s still a cripple,”mi Chen said. ”

“Really?”Xu Yao asked.

Mi Chen smiled at Xu Yao. “When have I ever lied to You?”

“After saying that, Mi Chen put her arm around Xu Yao’s shoulder. “Yaoyao, now we just have to wait for the news of he ziteng’s death.” ”

“Okay.”Xu Yao nodded and the corners of her mouth curled up.

“An hour later, Xu Yao received a call from the hospital. ”

“At that moment, she was sitting in Mi Chen’s arms. ”

“After answering the call, mi chen asked, “How is it?” ”

“The panic and confusion on Xu Yao’s face disappeared. She smiled and said, “As you expected, he ziteng is currently being treated in the ICU. His condition is very bad.” ”

Mi Chen also smiled.

“Half an hour later, Xu Yao rushed to the hospital. ”

The He family’s parents were waiting anxiously at the entrance of the emergency room.

“Father he was fine. Looking at mother he’s eyes, it was obvious that she had just cried. ”

“Xu Yao secretly curled her lips, but she looked very anxious. Her eyes were red. “Uncle, Auntie, I’m Sorry I’m late. Ziteng, is Ziteng Okay?” ”

“”B * Tch!”Mother he couldn’t help but slap Xu Yao’s face. “It’s all because of you! It’s all because I wanted to buy milk tea for you that Ziteng got into a car accident! If anything happens to Ziteng today, I’m not done with you!” ”

“She had warned he ziteng long ago that Xu Yao wasn’t a good woman, but he ziteng just wouldn’t listen! ”

“Xu Yao was hit so hard that her head tilted, and blood dripped from the corner of her mouth. She cried and apologized, “Auntie, I’m sorry. It’s all my fault. I didn’t do it on purpose!” ”

“Mother he wanted to reach out and slap Xu Yao again, but father he stopped her. “It’s already happened. It’s useless even if you beat her to death!” ”

“If she was really beaten to death, she would still have to go to jail. ”

“At this moment, the door of the emergency room was opened and the Doctor walked out. ”

The He family’s parents and Xu Yao immediately surrounded him.

“”Doctor, is my son Alright?” ”

“The Doctor took off his mask and shook his head regretfully, “Although the operation has been successful so far, the patient’s injuries are too serious. I’m afraid that he won’t be able to survive tonight! Even if a miracle can happen and he can survive tonight, he will only be a vegetable in the future.” ”

How could this be?

How could this be?

“At this moment, tears fell like rain from his mother’s eyes. ”

“He ziteng was only 29 years old this year, and his life had just begun... ”

“Hearing this, Xu Yao’s vision went black, and she fainted immediately. ”

“Madam! Are You Alright!”The nurse beside her immediately helped Xu Yao up.

“However, Xu Yao was still unconscious. ”

The doctor gave Xu Yao a checkup.

“A moment later, she walked out from inside. “Are you the family members of that Madam Just Now?” ”

“Mother he was about to say no when the doctor continued, “That Madam is already more than two months pregnant. Because she had just suffered a shock, her fetal qi is a little unstable. Do you want to give her a prenatal injection?” ”

What?

Xu Yao was pregnant?

Mother he and father he were both stunned.

“Father he was the first to react. He walked up to the doctor and asked, “What did you say? She’s pregnant?” ”

“”Yes.”The doctor nodded. “Also, what’s with the wound on the pregnant woman’s face? Are you the family members of the pregnant woman?” ”

“Father he immediately said, “I am. I Am. She is my son’s girlfriend!” ”

The Doctor took out the document. “Then you can sign here.”

Father he took the document and lowered his head to sign it.

“He ziteng’s life and death were unknown. The Doctor said that even if he was lucky enough to survive, he would only be a vegetable. The child in Xu Yao’s stomach was the only blood that he ziteng had left. ”

“No matter what, he could not let the child in Xu Yao’s stomach be harmed. ”

“Mother he stood rooted to the ground, not knowing how to react. ”

The girl she hated the most was pregnant with her son’s child.

“Unfortunately, her son was unconscious at this time. ”

“After signing the papers, father he looked at mother he. “Xunfang, now that Ziteng is like this, we must protect the child in Xu Yao’s stomach.” ”

“What if this child is not Ziteng’s?”Mother he asked.

“Father he said, “It should be Ziteng’s. After all, they have already cohabited. Moreover, ziteng also said last time that Xu Yao might get pregnant one day!” ”

“Speaking up to this point, father he paused and continued, “Isn’t there that bone spur test now? Xu Yao wouldn’t dare lie to us!” ”

“Hearing this, mother he nodded. ”

“Father he continued, “Well, the Doctor said that pregnant women should eat less and eat more. I’ll go buy some food first. You wait here.” ”

“Okay.”Mother he nodded. Her face was full of despair.

Why.

Why did fate treat her like this?

“Soon, father he bought some food back. ”

It was also at this time that Xu Yao woke up.

“Father he brought food into the ward. “Child, you’re awake.” ”

“Xu Yao sneered in her heart. This old thing was indeed hypocritical. When he heard the news of her pregnancy, his face immediately changed. ”

It was simply disgusting.

“Xu Yao’s face was full of tears as she continued, “Where’s ziteng? I’ve Let Ziteng Down. I’ve let him down!” ”

“”Child, do you know that you’re Pregnant?” ”

“Pregnant?”Xu Yao looked at Father Xu as if she didn’t know anything.
