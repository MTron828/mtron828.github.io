It sounded like it was too late. “B * Tch! B * Tch! You want to run? Bah!”

“After the bald man spat on the short-haired woman’s face, he gave her a hard slap and then kicked her. ”

The woman curled up on the ground in pain.

“Her only hope was gone. Zhao Pingting collapsed in the iron cage. Her face was pale, like a dead tree. ”

The voice call was hung up automatically because no one answered for a long time.

“A few seconds later, the voice call came again from the quiet air. ”

“The bald man frowned. He picked up the phone on the ground and hung up the voice call. Then, he walked to Zhao Pingting with the phone. “What’s the password?” ”

Zhao Pingting didn’t say anything.

“What’s the password?”The pervert asked again.

Zhao Pingting still didn’t say anything.

The pervert frowned and the veins on his face bulged. He picked up the steel pipe on the ground and opened the door of the cage. “I’m going to ask you one last time. What’s the password?”

“Zhao Pingting said in a trembling voice, “996216.” ”

The bald man swung the steel pipe and smashed it on Zhao Pingting’s body.

Zhao Pingting could not resist the sudden pain and screamed.

It hurt.

It was so painful that she could hardly breathe.

Zhao Pingting felt like she was a dog locked in an iron cage.

“The Bald Man entered the password and unlocked it. He opened wechat and looked at the chat logs between Ye Zhuo and Zhao Pingting, he copied Zhao Pingting’s usual tone and replied, “Great Burning, I’m busy right now. It’s not convenient for me to use voice chat. Let’s talk again when we have time!” ”

“Seeing Zhao Pingting’s reply, ye Zhuo heaved a sigh of relief. “Okay.” ”

“After replying to Ye Zhuo’s message, the bald man realized that Zhao Pingting’s family had also sent a message to Zhao Pingting. He also replied to her family’s message. ”

“Looking at the Bald Man’s actions, the hope in Zhao Pingting’s eyes instantly disappeared without a trace. ”

She had originally planned to make ye Zhuo suspicious and call the police if he could not contact her.

“But now, it seemed that this plan was not going to work. ”

The bald man could tell at a glance that he was imitating her tone to reply to Ye Zao.

What should she do?

What should she do now?

Was she really going to die here?

“Thinking of this, Zhao Pingting’s heart turned cold. ”

She did not want to die.

She still wanted to see the sun tomorrow.

“Zhao Pingting hugged her knees with both hands and bit the back of her hands helplessly. Even the back of her hands was bleeding from biting, but she still did not know it. ”

“After the bald man replied to the Wechat message, he turned off his phone and began to rape another woman. Soon, the air was filled with a strong smell of blood and screams. ”

Zhao Pingting closed her eyes tightly. She wished that she was dreaming.

“Unfortunately, she was not. ”

The scene in front of her was real. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

On the other side.

“After confirming that Zhao Pingting was fine, ye Zhuo continued to eat spicy hot soup. ”

“Halfway through the meal, Cen Shaoqing sent a message. [ leader, are you asleep? ] ”

“[ not yet. ] After replying to Cen Shaoqing’s message, ye Zao took another photo of spicy hotpot. ”

[ spicy hotpot? ]

[ yes. ]

Cen Shaoqing was actually hungry at night. [ is it good? ]

[ of course it’s Good! ]

“Cen Shaoqing continued to reply. [ although it’s good, you should eat less junk food and drink more water after eating. ] ”

Cen Shaoqing would never touch such junk food in the past.

“Ever since he got to know ye Zhuo, he had tasted almost everything from spicy hot pot, Guan Dong cooking, stinky tofu, stir-fried cold noodles, spicy hot pot, and other roadside stalls. ”

“Ye Zhuo was afraid that the fans in the spicy hot pot would get burnt, so he took a big gulp before continuing to chat with Cen Shaoqing. ”

At the same time.

On the other side.

Zhao Xueyin had already been in the capital for a few days.

“However, she did not find any opportunity to get in touch with Ye Zhuo. ”

Zhao Xueyin was very anxious.

“If this continued, the situation would be very unfavorable for her. ”

Zhao Xueyin sat in front of the floor-to-ceiling window and looked down at the scenery outside. She narrowed her eyes slightly.

It seemed that she had to speed up her progress.

She could not waste any more time.

“In the blink of an eye, the next day arrived. ”

Lin family.

“However, when the first ray of sunlight shone through the window in the morning, the girl lying on the bed frowned slightly. Her long and thick eyelashes trembled slightly. Under the morning sunlight, her porcelain-white skin seemed to be almost transparent, in a flash, the girl opened her eyes gently, revealing a pair of crystal clear eyes. ”

Ye Zhuo habitually picked up the phone placed on the bedside and looked at the time.

6:30 in the morning.

“Ye Zhuo stretched his body, then stood up from the bed and walked to the bathroom to wash up and change his clothes. ”
