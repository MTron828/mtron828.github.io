Translator: 549690339

“Bai Mo was really regretting it now. If she had known that ye Han would have today’s fortune, she would not have given Shi Qingcheng this opportunity. ”

“At that time, her relationship with Ye Han was very good. As long as she worked a little harder, Ye Han’s girlfriend would not have been Shi Qingcheng. ”

Who would have thought that the throne of the Chang Yue Kingdom would benefit ye Han?

“This person was really like a river flowing in the east for thirty years, and the river flowing in the west for thirty years. ”

“After all, Ye Han was just a homeless child who did not have a home in the past. ”

“If he had not met Ye Zhuo, would he be where he is now? ”

“Even now, there were many times when Bai Mo did not dare to believe that ye Han had actually become the ruler of the Chang Yue country. ”

“Bai Mo’s eyes were filled with unwillingness. She was also dissatisfied with Shi Qingcheng everywhere. However, she did not show it. Instead, she smiled at Shi Qingcheng and said, “Miss Shi is indeed as the rumors say, country-toppling, city-toppling, and beautiful.” ”

“”Just So-so,”Shi Qingcheng continued, “Fourth in the world.” ”

Fourth in the world?

“Bai Jingshu felt a little strange when she heard this. She continued, “Isn’t she third in the world?” ”

“Shi Qingcheng explained, “Because burning is third.” ”

The biggest similarity between Shi Qingcheng and ye burning was narcissism.

Bai Mo snorted coldly in her heart. Even someone like Shi Qingcheng had the nerve to say that she was fourth in the world.

Did she think that all the women in the world were dead?

“There was no femininity in her, nor did she know how to be reserved. Bai Mo looked at Ye Han and was very curious as to why ye Han would take a fancy to such a weirdo. ”

Bai Jingshu laughed softly. “So that’s how it is.”

“Bai Mo smiled and said, “Miss Shi is completely worthy of the title of fourth most beautiful woman in the world.” ”

“”Thank you.”Shi Qingcheng turned her head and looked at Bai Mo, thanking her without any modesty. ”

“With such a little green tea, there was no need to put on an act, putting on a show of sisterly love. ”

“Bai Mo suddenly felt that Shi Qingcheng was not easy to deal with. She originally thought that girls who came from military schools would be like boys, a little crazy, but Shi Qingcheng was not like that. ”

“Although the conversation between them did not exceed ten sentences, Shi Qingcheng gave her a feeling that she was not someone to be trifled with. ”

Bai Mo narrowed her eyes.

She could not panic.

She could not panic now.

What was Shi Qingcheng?

“She had been good friends with Ye Han for so many years, and no one knew ye Han better than she did. Could she lose to Shi Qingcheng? ”

“Moreover, Ye Han and Shi Qingcheng were in different places. ”

“Thinking of this, Bai Mo felt much better. ”

She would definitely become the first lady of Changyue!

“Shi Qingcheng turned to look at ye Han and continued, “Why aren’t you wearing the clothes I bought for you last time?” ”

“”What size did Miss Shi Buy?”Bai Mo continued, “Ye Xiaohan wears XXL clothes. He likes blue and white the most, and he hates gray the most. If you accidentally step on his minefield, he won’t wear it.” ”

“It was a very simple sentence. If it had been between ordinary friends, it would have been fine. ”

But it had to be in front of Ye Han’s girlfriend.

“As soon as she finished speaking, the scene fell silent. ”

Shi Qingcheng was not embarrassed. She looked at Ye Han with a smile. “Do you like Gray the most?”

“Ye Han said, “As long as it’s something you bought, I Like It!” ”

“Then why aren’t you wearing the clothes I bought for you today?”Shi Qingcheng asked.

“Ye Han continued, “I’ve been wearing that shirt for seven days in a row, and it’s starting to smell.” ”

“OH.”Shi Qingcheng nodded.

Ye Han looked at Shi Qingcheng. “Why don’t you buy me another one? I’ll go back and change into it so that others won’t misunderstand anything.”

“Bai Mo’s expression was a little ugly. She originally thought that ye Han would listen to her words, but in the end, not only did he not, the two of them started to show off their love in front of her instead. What was this? ”

What was she?

“Bai Mo was almost dying of curiosity, but she had no way to vent, so she could only endure it. ”

“Bai Jingshu felt that the situation was a little awkward. In order to break the situation in front of her, Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “The sun is too bright outside today. Why Don’t we go in? I’m not White to begin with. If I continue to bask in the Sun, I’ll turn into charcoal!” ”

“”Okay.”Elder bai nodded and continued, “You young people can do whatever you want. I’m Old and don’t have as much energy as you guys. Let’s go back and rest first.” ”

“At the end of his sentence, elder Bai turned to look at Bai mo. “Lass Mo, come with me for a moment.” ”

“Bai Mo’s heart skipped a beat when she heard that. She subconsciously felt that there was nothing good about it, but she still followed elder Bai’s footsteps. ”

Elder Bai did not say anything along the way.

The atmosphere was a little oppressive.

“When they reached the study, elder Bai said, “Close the door.” ”Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates
