Chapter 26: Who Are You To Be So Despotic?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Everything was fine, so why did Li Boyang suddenly bring up Lin Shasha’s educational background?

Ye Zhuo furrowed her brows ever so slightly as she asked, “What are you trying to say here?”

“Don’t misunderstand me. I don’t have any opinion of Lin Shasha.” Li Boyang continued to speak, “I only think that we will need to prioritize our studies at this stage of our lives now. After all, knowledge can change our lives. Therefore, it’s best for you to stay away from the people who only graduated middle school like Lin Shasha….”

Li Boyang had a favorable impression of Ye Zhuo, so he genuinely hoped Ye Zhuo would become more outstanding. There was no need for her to be overly exceptional, but at the very least, he wanted her to be able to catch up to him.

“What’s wrong with being a middle school graduate? A good educational background can only show that a person’s gained more knowledge than ordinary people. However, a good educational background doesn’t represent one’s accomplishment. The real accomplishment should come from one’s heart, so how is it related to a good educational background? Some people are too comfortable that they are aloof and feel that it’s already impressive enough to have a good educational background. In truth, these people will never know that they’re the ones with a limited view of the world!”

Ye Zhuo enunciated her words clearly and continued, “Could it be that your good educational background has allowed you to badmouth others behind their backs?”

Li Boyang was completely dumbstruck by Ye Zhuo’s response. He was blushing scarlet from embarrassment after being criticized by Ye Zhuo to the point where he felt that the classics that he read over the years were for nothing. The extent of his knowledge was actually less than a middle-school student! This realization made Li Boyang narrow his eyes. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Nonetheless, he was only commenting about Lin Shasha. Why did Ye Zhuo have to be so irritated?

Ye Zhuo spoke so ostentatiously because his comment had hurt Lin Shasha’s image and her own ego. It seemed that Ye Zhuo was afraid that others would despise her!

At the thought of this, Li Boyang felt better in his heart. “Ye Zhuo, calm down first. I didn’t mean that; I was only making a casual comment.”

Ye Zhuo then took a glance at Li Boyang. “Shasha is a friend of mine, and she is a very kind, sweet person. Your casual comment had already hurt her without you noticing.”

Li Boyang hastily apologized, “I’m, I’m sorry….”

“Take note of that next time.” Ye Zhuo spoke in a cold tone. Upon saying that, she turned around and walked to the other side of the shop.

For some unknown reason, Li Boyang had a very strange feeling when Ye Zhuo said, ‘take note of that next time.’ It felt just like a teacher lecturing a student who committed an offense.

Perhaps, that was why he subconsciously apologized to her. Could it be that it was just an… illusion?

All of a sudden, Granny Cen walked out from a corner. She nodded in satisfaction as she gazed after Ye Zhuo’s departing silhouette.

‘Not bad, not bad!’

The more she learned about the young maiden, the more fond of her she became.

She was not someone who put up a facade in front of others and behaved differently behind their backs.

…

In the gambling house...

Ye Zhuo had not stepped into the gambling house for three consecutive days.

Meanwhile, Cen Shaoqing stood at the corner with a hand on the guardrail. He spoke in a nonchalant tone, “It has already been three days; you’ve lost.”

Li Qiandong frowned deeply. “She’s going to come for sure! Brother Fifth, you must believe me. It’s not time yet!”

Li Qiandong was proud of himself for seeing through countless women! With his experience, how could he possibly be mistaken? Ye Zhuo would certainly turn up tonight.

Unfortunately for him, there was still no sign of Ye Zhuo even after they waited for a long while. Could it be that she was still playing hard to get?

“Do a live streaming of you eating sh*t now.” Cen Shaoqing tilted his head to look toward Li Qiandong.

He looked so breathtaking that even when he was cussing, there was utterly no sense of inharmoniousness.

Eat sh*t? … For real?

If Cen Shaoqing did not bring this up, he would have forgotten about this deal.

Cen Shaoqing stepped forward and walked ahead. “Remember to send me the link to your live stream upon my return.”

“Don’t, Brother Fifth….” Li Qiandong stretched out his hand to tug at Cen Shaoqing’s sleeve.

“A man should take responsibility for his words and actions.” Cen Shaoqing looked back ever so slightly as he spoke. “However, it’s genuinely an abomination for a man to eat sh*t….”

Upon hearing that, Li Qiandong heaved a sigh of relief.

He knew that Cen Shaoqing would never entrap his good friend this way.

How could Cen Shaoqing really make him eat sh*t, huh!?

Who would have thought that Cen Shaoqing would deviate from the topic of conversation by saying, “We shall replace it with raw pork intestines. I will send someone to bring you 1kg of pork intestines later.”

What?

Raw pork intestines?

Cen Shaoqing wanted him to eat raw pork intestines?

Pork intestines still carried a very intense funk even after it was cooked, let alone eating it raw. One should know that Li Qiandong would not even eat cooked pork intestines, so making him eat a raw one was even worse than making him eat sh*t!

It felt as if Cen Shaoqing could read Li Qiandong’s mind. ‘It’s better for you to do a live stream of you eating sh*t then.’

Li Qiandong was speechless.

F*ck!

That was merciless!

So cruel!

Li Qiandong immediately yielded. “I was wrong, Brother Fifth! I’ll eat it; I’ll eat it, is that okay?”

“Let’s head home.” Cen Shaoqing kept the prayer beads while his gaze swept past the scene downstairs.

Li Qiandong immediately followed him and said in a slightly reluctant tone, “Brother Fifth, can we discuss the pork intestines idea? Firstly, I’m certain that Ye Zhuo is playing hard to get; perhaps, she is trying to lead you on for a few more days. If she’s not coming here today, she will certainly come tomorrow! I guarantee it! I swear!”

Cen Shaoqing spoke in a nonchalant tone, “So what if she still isn’t here tomorrow?”

Li Qiandong clenched his teeth. “I’ll take 2kg of pork intestines then!” The reason why Li Qiandong was so confident was because he was convinced that Ye Zhuo would certainly come.

Since Ye Zhuo had already drawn Cen Shaoqing’s attention earlier, it did not make sense for her to give up at this crucial juncture.

Consequently, Cen Shaoqing nodded ever so slightly. “We shall place a new bet then.”

“Don’t worry, Brother Fifth. I will certainly not let you down this time.” Li Qiandong caught up to Cen Shaoqing with a smile on his face.

…

On the other side.

Ye Zhuo and Ye Sen were walking home.

The faint moonlight cast a layer of pure white glow over their bodies.

Ye Zhuo said, “Uncle, you still need to get up early in the morning every day. There’s no need for you to come and get me from now on. It’s fine for me to walk home alone.”

Ye Sen furrowed his brows. “How is that fine!? You’re a girl! It is so dangerous for you to walk home alone at night! What if you’re in danger? Who’s going to protect you?”

Ye Zhuo smiled and answered, “I can protect myself.”

Ye Sen took a glance at Ye Zhuo and felt rather speechless. He said, “Look at you with your tiny arms and legs. Someone can pick you up with just one hand, so how can you protect yourself then, huh?”

Even though Ye Zhuo was very tall at about 1.72 meters, she was too skinny. Her tiny wrists looked like they would snap very easily. In fact, every time the wind blew strongly, Ye Sen felt like picking up a few rocks and placing them in Ye Zhuo’s pockets. Otherwise, he was worried that Ye Zhuo would be blown away by the wind.

“You don’t know who’s going to pick up who yet.” Ye Zhuo raised an eyebrow.

Ye Sen shook his head helplessly. “Little girl, all you do is brag!”

Just then, a few people were standing not too far away with cigarettes that flickered in their hands. They appeared to be standing closely together while making perverted jokes.

Under the moonlight and street lights, they saw Ye Zhuo and Ye Sen walking toward them. One of them hastily tossed away the cigarette in his hand. “Brother Tao! Brother Tao! Look over there!”

Upon hearing that, the leading young man with tattoos on his body stood upright and looked toward the specified direction. “Buck up, everyone! Is the camera ready?”

“Don’t worry; Brother Tao, it’s ready!” The young man next to him raised the camera in his hand.

The other few people hastily took out the steel pipes that they hid in advance. These steel pipes reflected cold radiance under the silver-white moonlight’s reflection.

Ye Sen noticed the group of people in front of him. He narrowed his eyes and felt an ominous feeling in his chest.

It was fortunate that he had been picking Ye Zhuo up after work on time; otherwise, Ye Zhuo would be at a severe disadvantage tonight.

“Zhuo Zhuo, something feels wrong with the people in front. Remember to hide behind me later.” When he was speaking, Ye Sen had already moved himself in front of Ye Zhuo, subconsciously.

“Stop!” Meanwhile, a steel pipe blocked Ye Sen’s path.

Ye Sen raised his head to see a few fierce faces. “How dare you be a tyrant in Brother Sen’s witness!? Are you unaware that this area here is my territory?”

The tattooed young man grabbed Ye Sen’s collar and lifted Ye Sen just like that. “Heh, you’re such a trash talker, huh!?”

At that moment, Ye Sen had just noticed the tattoos on the young man’s neck.

It was…

The tattoo was especially used by the gangsters in this area.

Ye Sen’s throat was choked, and his expression changed drastically while cold sweat permeated his forehead. He stuttered, “So, so it turns out you’re Brother Tao, huh!? It seems that there’s a conflict between people on the same side this time. I didn’t manage to recognize that it was you, sir. You’re a great person who is big-hearted and magnanimous; there’s no need for you to lower yourself to the same level as a nobody like me….”

“Let go of my uncle.” Ye Zhuo took a step forward from the side and displayed a nonchalant gaze. The moonlight cast a layer of faint glow on her jade-like delicate face. “You have three seconds.”

“Hah…” The tattooed young man lifted Ye Sen with one hand and turned his head to look toward Ye Zhuo. He was stunned for a moment, but then his surprise slowly turned into disdain.

The little girl was such a big talker!

“3, 2, …” Ye Zhuo began counting down with her arms crossed. The corners of her lips curled up ever so slightly in a cold yet tyrannical manner.

Noticing that Ye Zhuo was so despotic, Ye Sen panicked. “Brother Tao, this is my niece. The child doesn’t know any better; please don’t bother her. Zhuo Zhuo! You’re a child, don’t meddle with these adult matters. Go home, quick!”
