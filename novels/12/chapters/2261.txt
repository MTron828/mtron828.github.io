Lin Ze placed Bai Jingshu in the passenger seat. “You’ve been drugged. I’ll take you to the hospital.”

“”It’s useless,”Bai Jingshu said. ”

“Why?”Lin Ze frowned slightly.

“Bai Jingshu continued, “This medicine can only be cured in the S Galaxy.” ”

“”Go to my sister’s place,”Lin ze said. ”

“Miss Ye?”Bai Jingshu asked.

“Yes.”

“Only then did Bai Jingshu remember that ye Zao was also the famous Miracle Doctor Ye of the s galaxy. She continued, “Thank you, Mr. Lin.” ”

“We’re friends.”

These simple words warmed Bai Jingshu’s heart.

“After helping Bai Jingshu fasten her seatbelt, Lin Ze went around to the other side and sat in the driver’s seat. “My Sister is a little far from here. It might take about thirty minutes. Bear with it.” ”

“”Okay,”Bai Jingshu said. ”

“Bai Jingshu looked calm, but in reality, she felt like thousands of ants were gnawing at her heart. It was hot and dry. ”

She had to bear with it.

She had to bear with it.

“Bai Jingshu’s hands were clenched into fists. Because she had used too much force, they had already turned slightly white. ”

Lin Ze knew that she was feeling very uncomfortable right now. He had been speeding the entire way. He held the steering wheel with one hand and put on his bluetooth earpiece with the other. “Are You Home?”

“”Okay, I’ll bring a friend over. I’ve already sent you a wechat message about the symptoms.” ”

Bai Jingshu could no longer hear anything.

“The air conditioner was on in the car, but she felt unusually hot. The delusions in her heart had gradually broken her calm. Bai Jingshu could only rely on the pain to stay awake. ”

Her lower lip was bleeding from her bite.

Lin Ze looked at her through the rearview mirror and frowned slightly.

He had to be faster.

“Finally, the 30-minute journey ended in 16 minutes. ”

“Lin Ze opened the car door and saw Ye Zhuo trotting over. “Brother, where are you?” ”

“In the car.”

“After saying that, Lin Ze went around to the passenger seat and opened the car door. “Miss Bai, we’re here.” ”

“With that, he bent down and carried Bai Jingshu out of the car. ”

“To Bai Jingshu, Lin Ze was like a natural block of ice. It was as if a thirsty desert had encountered a pool of spring water. ”

“After a long drought, there would always be rain. ”

She subconsciously crawled into Lin Ze’s arms.

“Lin Ze did not go through this. He turned to look at Ye Zao. “Zao Zao, is there any way to calm her down?” ”

“”Let’s go in first,”ye Zao said. ”

“Okay.”

Lin Ze immediately followed ye Zao’s footsteps.

“Although the road outside the house was not very far from the inside, Lin Ze felt as if he had walked for a century. Although he was calm, at the same time, he was also a hot-blooded youth. With such a beauty in his arms, if he did not react at all.., that would be abnormal. ”

“If the current Lin Ze was like a natural ice cube to Bai Jingshu, then she would be like a ticking time bomb to Lin Ze. ”

He walked to Ye Zao’s room.

“Ye Zao continued, “Put her on my bed.” ”

“”Okay.”Lin Ze nodded and placed Bai Jingshu on the bed. Then, he said, “I’ll go out for a while.” ”

“Okay.”

“After saying that, Lin Ze fled from ye Zao’s room. If one looked closely, one could see his flushed cheeks. ”

Lin Ze walked all the way to the washroom. He stood in front of the sink and washed his face with cold water.

“The cold water splashed on his face, calming him down a little. ”

In the room.

“After Lin Ze left, ye Zao realized that the person lying on the bed was actually Bai Jingshu. ”

“Jingshu?”

Ye Zao checked Bai Jingshu’s pulse and called out to her.

Bai Jingshu had completely lost consciousness. Her entire body was drenched in sweat.

“Whitey!”Ye Zao called out.

“Whitey, who was charging, heard the voice and immediately glided over. “Scorch!” ”

“”Go get my medical box,”ye Zao said. ”

“Okay.”

Whitey immediately went over to get the medical box.

“Soon, Yi Ling came over with the medical box. ”

Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly. “Where’s Whitey?”

“Yi Ling flapped her wings. “Little White said that men and women shouldn’t be intimate, so it didn’t come in.” ”

Ye Zao:”...” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“A moment later, ye Zao took out the silver needles from the first aid kit and inserted them into Bai Jingshu’s acupuncture points. ”

“After the needles were inserted, the redness on Bai Jingshu’s face immediately disappeared. ”

“However, that was not enough. ”

Ye Zao took out another black pill and fed it to Bai Jingshu.

“Ten minutes later, Bai Jingshu calmed down completely. However, she was still not fully conscious. ”

“After doing all this, Ye Zhuo called his auntie over to scrub Bai Jingshu’s body. ”

At the same time.
