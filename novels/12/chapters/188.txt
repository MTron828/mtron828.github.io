Chapter 189: 088: Big Brother Zao is online. I’ve finally found her! 2

He really wanted to see how long ye Zao could keep up the pretense.

Ye Zao said, “Beijing University.”

“Beijing University?”Li Boyang’s eyes were filled with surprise.

He thought to himself.

This ye Zao was too good at bragging!

Beijing university was even more famous than key 985 Qinghua University. It was ranked in the international rankings!

Even he did not dare to say that he would be able to get into Beijing University.

Ye Zao had only bought a beiqiao uniform online, yet he dared to speak without thinking.

He had really lied too much and even believed his own words.

“I want to get into Qinghua,”Li Boyang continued.

“I wish your dream come true.”Ye Zao took out his phone from his pocket. “I’m going to be late soon, so I won’t talk to you anymore.”

Ye Zao was in a hurry to go to school.

In Li Boyang’s eyes, it was like running away in a hurry.

......

He had to use a hundred lies to cover up one lie.

Was Ye Zao feeling guilty?

Although ye Zao Lied and was quite vain, Li Boyang couldn’t help but feel his heart beat faster every time he saw her.

He couldn’t control it.

He knew that it was the performance of liking someone.

Ye Zao was so beautiful. It was normal for him to like ye Zao.

Although Qian Lingyu had said that ye Zao wasn’t good enough for him.

But it shouldn’t be a problem to date, right?

Who Didn’t have a few girlfriends in college?

Although ye Zao wasn’t educated, he was beautiful. It was just dating, not marriage. He didn’t lose out!

When the college entrance exam results came out, he walked to ye Zao with the admission letter from Qinghua University.

Ye Zao would definitely agree to it!

Ye Zao had just graduated from junior high school, but he was a university student from a well-known university. No matter how one looked at it, Ye Zao was always high up.

Only a fool would disagree!

The more Li Boyang thought about it, the more excited he became.

In the upcoming exam preparation time, he had to study hard.

He would be admitted to Qinghua University!

“Zao Zao!”Just as he arrived at the school gate, he saw an Lizi and Zhao Pingting waiting for her.

“Lizi, Pingting!”

Ye Zha jogged over.

“Zha Zha, this is the burrito that my mother asked me to bring for you.”An Lizi handed ye Zha an oilpaper bag.

Ye Zha reached out to take it. “Help me thank Auntie.”

Zhao Pingting chewed on the burrito as she mumbled, “Zha Zha, quick, try it. Auntie’s cooking is amazing!”

Ye Zha opened the oilpaper bag and took a bite.

The taste was really good.

Although an Lizi’s family had just had a big incident, she was still in a good state and was not affected by it.

The three of them walked to the tree-lined path on the campus, forming a beautiful scenery.

“What the F * ck! Isn’t that the class favorite of Class 7?”

“Watch your words. She’s also the new campus Belle!”

Yes.

Ye Zhuo had just arrived at the school last semester, but he was already chosen as the campus Belle!

Hearing this, the girls at the side said enviously, “She’s so beautiful, and her figure is also good...”

“Otherwise, how could she be the campus Belle!”

“What Campus Belle? I think it’s a joke about cheating!”A sarcastic female voice sounded from the side.

The few of them turned around and looked.

They saw Lin Wuyue and Zeng Rou from rocket class 3.

Standing between the two was the former school Belle, Mu Yourong.

Mu Yourong’s expression was extremely ugly.

She was clearly the school Belle!

She was the chess master!

She was also the popular female streamer!

But now, all the glory that should have belonged to her had been snatched away by Ye Zao.

What was even more unacceptable to Mu Yourong was that.

Ye Zao had actually easily dealt with those top-notch relatives of the Ye family.

She had originally wanted to use those top-notch relatives to cause trouble for ye Zao.

She had not expected that not only was ye Zao living a good life, but it was those top-notch relatives who had all met with mishaps.

Ye Shuang’s family had fallen from grace. One of her two daughters had been imprisoned, while the other had been forced to withdraw from school.

Ye Shuai had also been imprisoned for fraud...

Yao Cuifen could not bear the blow and suffered a stroke, causing her to be paralyzed and bedridden! UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

If it was said that these people’s successive accidents had nothing to do with Ye Zao, Mu Yourong did not believe it at all.

After all, these people only had problems one after another after finding trouble with ye Zao.

But the ye Zao she knew was just trash!

What on Earth was going on?

From the moment ye Zao started the live broadcast, Mu Yourong felt that things were slowly slipping out of her control.

She was a reborn daughter!

A favored child of the heavens!

A Phoenix roaming the nine regions!

She would not allow anyone to defeat her.

Especially since this person was ye Zao, who had died at her hands in her previous life.

What right did ye Zao have?

Mu Yourong’s expression grew colder and colder.

Lin Wuyue continued, “The real campus belle should be us, yourong! Not only is she beautiful, her academic results are also good! She’s the No. 1 Among Us Girls! Other than that face of ye Zao, what else is there? Do you really think that a good-for-nothing can get first place in the entire school?”
