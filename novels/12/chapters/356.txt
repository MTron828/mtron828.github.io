“For a moment, Ye Sen was deep in thought. ”

“Seeing ye Sen like this, Milo thought that Ye Sen was not satisfied with the contract, so she quickly said, “Mr. Ye, if you are not satisfied with any treaty, you can bring it up. We will immediately change it for you.” ”

“Ye Sen finally reacted and smiled, “No, no, I am very satisfied with your company’s contract.” ”

“”Then please confirm it. If there are no problems, you can sign it,”Milo said. ”

“Okay.”

Milo immediately handed him a pen.

Ye Sen quickly signed the contract.

“Milo extended his hand to ye Sen. “Mr. Ye, I wish us a happy cooperation.” ”

“Happy Cooperation.”Ye Sen shook Milo’s hand.

“After signing the contract, Milo left with his assistant. ”

Ye Sen did not expect the contract to be signed so smoothly.

It felt like a dream.

“Xiao Zhang peeled an apple for ye Sen. “Mr. Ye, now that the contract has been settled, you can rest in peace, right?” ”

“Ye Sen took the apple and thanked him. He asked curiously, “Xiao Zhang, what is Xiao Cen’s identity?” ”

“To be able to make a big organization like Yuaeon bow down to him, Cen Shaoqing must have a powerful background. ”

Little Cen?

Ye Sen was probably the first person who dared to call Cen Shaoqing that way.

Little Zhang raised his head and looked at Ye Sen with a complicated expression. “Are you talking about our fifth master?”

“Yes.”Ye Sen nodded.

“Little Zhang gulped and continued, “Mr. Ye, do you know the CEN Fifth Master of the capital city?” ”

CEN fifth Master of the capital city?

“Among those who worked in the business world, who did not know CEN fifth master? ”

“This master led the business world at a young age, and even developed the CEN family of the capital into the number one family in China! ”

“At the age of 18, he became famous in a single battle. His methods were harsh, and he even cultivated a mysterious force. ”

No one dared to provoke him in the underworld.

It was terrifying.

There were many rumors about him in the business world.

“But no one had ever seen his true face, and he had never appeared in any financial column. ”

Even fewer people had actually seen him.

“Although ye Sen had long known that Cen Shaoqing’s identity was not simple, he really did not expect that CEN Shaoqing was the famous CEN fifth master! ”

That was CEN fifth master!

He was an existence that could summon the wind and rain in the business empire and was revered by everyone.

This feeling was too exciting!

Ye Sen was completely stunned.

“After a long while, he finally reacted and asked with some uncertainty, “Are you talking about the number one master in China, CEN Fifth Master?” ”

“Yes.”Xiao Zhang nodded. “Yes.”

It really was!

“Ye Sen took a deep breath and thought of the bent steel pipe. Suddenly, he felt a chill at the back of his neck. ”

Wasn’t he plucking the fur from the Tiger’s Butt?

Fortunately.

“Fortunately, Cen Shaoqing did not argue with him on account of Ye Zhuo. ”

“Ye Sen thought about it and then said, “Has your fifth master been losing weight recently?” ” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Ye Sen now knew that Cen Shaoqing was CEN fifth master, so he naturally did not dare to call Little Cen Little Cen. ”

Little Zhang shook his head. “No.”

“Ye Sen said, “Then why did he eat a pot of grass for lunch?” ”

“Little Zhang explained, “Fifth Master has always been a vegetarian. His lunch has always been mainly vegetables.” ”

“He’s really a vegetarian?”Ye Sen asked in disbelief.

“When ye Zhuo said that Cen Shaoqing was a vegetarian, he thought that ye Zhuo was joking with him. ”

“After all, how many young people nowadays could be vegetarian? ”

He did not expect that Cen Shaoqing was really a vegetarian.

Little Zhang nodded. “Our Master Five has been a vegetarian for more than ten years.”

Ye Sen’s face was full of surprise.

He had been a vegetarian for more than ten years.

CEN Shaoqing was too amazing!

An ordinary person really could not do it...

“Ye Sen thought about the words in his heart and continued, “Then has he ever been in a relationship?” ”

“Little Zhang shook his head. “No, our fifth master is a non-marital person. He has never been in a relationship, nor has he had any improper relationships with anyone. Even the assistant secretaries around him are all men.” ”

Doesn’t like to get married?

Ye Sen frowned slightly.

“If Cen Shaoqing didn’t like to get married, why would he treat him so well? ”

All of this was clearly for ye Zhuo’s sake.

Ye Sen’s heart was as clear as a mirror. He raised his head to look at Little Zhang. “Are you sure he doesn’t like to Get Married?”

“Little Zhang said with certainty, “Yes! I’m sure. I’ve been by fifth master’s side for almost ten years. In these ten years, he has never had any intimate contact with any woman.” ”

Xiao Zhang was Cen Shaoqing’s life assistant.

“Therefore, he did not know anything about the matter of the CEN Group’s CEO’s wife that was spreading like wildfire. ”

Ye Sen smiled and patted Xiao Zhang’s shoulder. “Do you believe that your master five is about to be enlightened?”
