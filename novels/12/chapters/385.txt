Translator: 549690339

Hearing this.

Mu Yourong was stunned.

No!

She could not call the police.

“If she did, wouldn’t everyone know about this? ”

The wealthy families valued innocence the most.

“If this matter were to be exposed, not only would her parents be unable to conduct themselves, it would also affect her marriage to Cen the fifth master. ”

No!

“Right now, she could only bite off her teeth and swallow her blood. ”

“”Since eldest miss mu isn’t going to call the police, then our brothers will leave.”The men began to put on their clothes. ”

“Mu Yourong sat on the bed, not saying a word. ”

An hour later.

Mu Yourong finally walked out of the hotel.

The pain in her body constantly reminded her of what had happened last night.

“Among the five men, the oldest was already in his fifties or sixties! ”

“Even in her previous life, Mu Yourong had never suffered such an insult. ”

The weather in August was clearly scorching hot.

But Mu Yourong felt her entire body turn cold.

Ye Zao!

It was definitely that slut ye Zao who was harming her!

Slut!

Mu Yourong’s entire body was trembling.

She had to take revenge!

She must return the humiliation she had suffered to ye Zao a thousand times over.

Mu Yourong returned to the Mu family in a daze.

“Seeing that Mu Yourong had returned, soldier mu said impatiently, “Yourong, you’re back! Has Young Master Li already agreed to help us?” ”

Soldier Mu was too anxious.

He was so anxious that he did not even notice the redness and swelling on mu yourong’s face.

“Mu Yourong raised her eyes to look at Soldier Mu. “Father, I’ll go upstairs and rest for a while. We’ll talk about other things later.” ”

“Soldier Mu wanted to say something else, but Mu Yourong had already gone upstairs. ”

“Sigh!”

Soldier Mu sighed deeply.

“After all the major investors had withdrawn their investments yesterday, the MU group’s shares had dropped by ten points today, and they were flying green all the way. ”

“Now, the shareholders of the company were already discussing about selling the company! ”

“They were already in a situation of imminent danger, so how could they wait? ”

“At this moment, Shen Rong walked past soldier Mu in a flashy outfit. She smiled and said to soldier mu, “Old Mu, what do you think of my outfit today?” ”

Soldier Mu turned to look at Shen Rong. “Where are you going?”

“Shen Rong said, “I have an appointment with Mrs. Sun and Mrs. Wang to play cards.” ”

“Soldier Mu was already in a fit of anger. When he heard these words, he was even more furious. He directly slapped Shen Rong’s face. “Play cards! Play cards! What else do you know other than cards?” ”

“Shen Rong was stunned by the slap. Her face swelled up and she said in disbelief, “Soldier Mu! You actually hit me!” ”

“Soldier mu said angrily, “Do you know that our family is going to go bankrupt!” ”

“What?”

Shen Rong was stunned.

...

Upstairs.

“Mu Yourong stood under the shower, using water to wash her body over and over again. ”

But those bruises couldn’t be washed away at all.

Mu Yourong finally came out of the bathroom and began to put on makeup.

She couldn’t lose!

She couldn’t lose to ye Zao!

“Since she couldn’t meet Li Qiandong by chance, she would personally go find Li Qiandong! ”

“After putting on some makeup, Mu Yourong went downstairs. ”

She drove to Li Qiandong’s address.

Li Qiandong lived in the wealthy district of Yunjing.

It was not far from the MU residence.

“Twenty minutes later, she appeared at the door of Li Qiandong’s apartment. ”

She rang the doorbell.

“Very quickly, the door opened from the inside. ”

“Li Qiandong had obviously just woken up. His eyes were sleepy and he was still wearing his sleeping robe. When he saw who it was, he immediately woke up from his drowsiness. “Yourong? !” ”

“At this moment, a delicate voice came from the room. “Who’s there so early in the morning?” ”

This was the female companion who had a one-night stand with Li Qiandong the previous night.

“Hearing this, Mu Yourong immediately took a step back. “I’m sorry, Big Brother Li. I’ve disturbed you. I’ll leave now.” ”

“Li Qiandong clearly noticed that mu yourong’s mood was not right. He hurriedly grabbed mu yourong’s wrist. “Yourong, come in first. Give me five minutes.” ”

“Mu Yourong pretended to struggle, but Li Qiandong’s grip was really too tight. ”

“Thus, Mu Yourong could only follow Li Qiandong into the room. ”

“”Yourong, sit on the sofa for a while.” ”

“Mu Yourong’s eyes were red and she said somewhat uneasily, “Big Brother Li, Am I disturbing you?” ”

“”No, don’t think too much.” ”

“After comforting Mu Yourong, Li Qiandong walked into the bedroom. ”

“A girl in sexy pajamas was lying on the bed. She had a very good figure. When she saw Li Qiandong enter, she immediately winked at him. “Young master Li, do you want to do it again?” ”

“Unexpectedly, Li Qiandong seemed to have changed into a different person. “I’ll give you three minutes! Get lost immediately!” ”
