“Master Yu was a little unhappy, “That’s your little junior sister! Not only is your little junior sister talented, intelligent, and graceful, but she also has an unparalleled beauty. I believe that after you meet her, you will definitely like her.”The ‘like’that master Yu mentioned was not the ‘like’between a man and a woman, he knew that Cen Shaoqing was not interested in women. ”

“Cen Shaoqing put down his teacup. “Master, I already have a girlfriend.”Other than ye Zhuo, Cen Shaoqing was not interested in anyone of the opposite sex. He was even less interested in this junior sister whom he had never met before. ”

“In his eyes, Ye Zhuo was the most outstanding. ”

This junior sister could not even be compared to a single strand of ye Zhuo’s hair.

“In Cen Shaoqing’s opinion, there was no essential difference between the junior sister and the passerby. ”

Cen Shaoqing could not be bothered to deal with this passerby.

What?

“Master Yu looked at Cen Shaoqing in surprise, his eyes filled with disbelief. ”

Cen Shaoqing actually had a girlfriend?

Didn’t he not get close to women?

Wasn’t he going to become a monk?

“”You, you’re not joking with me, right?” ”

Cen Shaoqing’s expression remained the same. “I’m not joking.”

Master Yu had taken Cen Shaoqing as his disciple when Cen Shaoqing was thirteen years old. No one knew Cen Shaoqing better than him.

He knew that Cen Shaoqing was not someone who liked to joke around.

“Since CEN Shaoqing had already said it, it meant that he really had a girlfriend. ”

Master Yu gulped and walked over to the window from the collapse. He pulled open the curtains and looked out.

“What are you looking at?”Cen Shaoqing opened his thin lips.

“Master Yu continued, “I’m looking to see if the Sun has risen from the west today.” ”

Cen Shaoqing actually fell in love and had a girlfriend. This was even more unbelievable than the sun rising from the west.

After a long while.

Master Yu finally reacted and walked to Cen Shaoqing’s side. “When did this happen?”

“”Last year,”Cen Shaoqing answered. ”

“Master Yu continued, “So, you’re not going to be a monk anymore?” ” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Master Yu glanced at Cen Shaoqing, “Since you’re not going to be a monk anymore, can you consider returning to the literary world? I’ve just found a junior sister for you. With the strong combination of you and your junior sister, the literary world will definitely reach a new peak!” ”

Ye Zhuo’s strength was not to be underestimated. Cen Shaoqing was next.

Master Yu seemed to have seen the glorious future of the literary world!

“I’m not interested.”Cen Shaoqing shook his head slightly.

“Master Yu continued, “Your junior sister is really very powerful. Aren’t you curious at all?” ”

“My girlfriend is also very powerful.”

“Master Yu curled his lips. “How can your girlfriend be as powerful as your junior sister? I’m not bragging, but I’ve traveled all over the world for so many years, but I’ve never seen such a powerful girl!” ”

Master Yu had never seen a girl as powerful as ye Zhuo.

Her manner of speaking did not seem like an eighteen or nineteen-year-old child at all.

“On the contrary, she looked at problems more sharply than someone like him who had gone through thousands of trials and tribulations! ”

Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads habitually. “I’ve also never seen a girl as powerful as my girlfriend.”

“”It’s said that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Even if your girlfriend is an idiot, you still think that your girlfriend is the most powerful and the most beautiful!”Master Yu had an expression that said, “I understand.” “Your junior sister is really amazing! Otherwise, she wouldn’t have become my last disciple! Let me tell you, your junior sister is the one who is truly talented and beautiful!” ”

“Cen Shaoqing was not someone who liked to argue with others. However, if he did not argue with them today, he felt that he would not be able to get past this hurdle in his heart. ”

Talented and beautiful?

He could not imagine who else could be called talented and beautiful other than ye Zhuo.

“”Master, you should know that there is always someone better out there. There is always someone better out there.” ”

There is always someone better out there?

Master Yu’s face was full of disdain. “I think your head has been kicked by a donkey.”

“Other than his disciple, who else could withstand this idiom, “There is always someone better out there.”? ”

Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads. “You are imagining things out of thin air.”

“Master Yu was so angry that his liver hurt. “I don’t want to argue with you right now. Facts speak louder than words. Do you dare to meet Your Junior Sister?”When Cen Shaoqing saw ye Zhuo, he knew that he was not bragging! ”

“You’re just an ordinary person. There’s nothing to see.”Cen Shaoqing’s tone was indifferent.

An ordinary person?

Who was he calling an ordinary person?

“Master Yu was so excited that his face was red. He tried to reason with Cen Shaoqing, “Shaoqing, I know you love me, but let’s be reasonable. Your Junior Sister is really outstanding. Is it difficult for you to admit that others are better than your girlfriend?” ”
