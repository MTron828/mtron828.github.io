“”What do you mean, what should we do?”Zou Feifei asked. ” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Ning LAN said, “Your grades were so high in the previous mock exams. Everyone thought that you would definitely get the top scorer. Now that there is such a thing as Lin Sha, what do you plan to do?” ”

Zou Feifei was also worried!

“After saying that, ning LAN continued, “But it doesn’t matter. Even if Lin Sha really gets the top scorer, you can still be a scout!” ”

Detective?

“Although detective was only one place away from the top scorer, it was far from the top scorer. ”

“Which TV station have you seen interviewing the second place?”Zou Feifei asked back.

“Every year, the TV stations competed to interview the first place. ”

“As for the second place, she didn’t even have a chance to talk, let alone show up! ”

What Zou Feifei wanted to do was to get first place and let the major TV stations in Yunjing City interview her!

She wanted to appear in front of the TV as the top scholar of the city. She wanted to prove her ability to all her relatives and friends

“Ning lan sighed and continued, “It would be great if something unexpected happened to Lin Sha!” ”

Something Unexpected?

What kind of accident?

“She wanted to get someone to steal Lin Sha’s admission ticket, but now the admission ticket could be printed freely! ”

Zou Feifei narrowed his eyes.

“At this moment, Zou Feifei seemed to have thought of something. He looked up at the driver and said, “Old Li, drive a little faster. Send Ning Lan home first.” ”

“Ning Lan was stunned. “Feifei, aren’t we going to watch a movie?” ”

“”I can’t bear to watch a movie. I have other things to do,”Zou Feifei said. ”

“Okay then!”Ning Lan nodded.

“The driver sped up. Ten minutes later, the car stopped in front of the Ning family’s villa. ”

Ning Lan pushed the door open and got out of the car. She said goodbye to Zou Feifei.

...

On the other side.

Beijing.

Professor Feng and director Ma came to the coffee shop one after the other.

Jamila was already sitting in the reserved seats waiting for them.

“Dr. Jamila.”

“”Professor Feng, director Ma, the two of you are here. Please take a seat.”Jamila stood up and greeted the two of them. ”

Professor Feng and director Ma sat on the chairs.

“Jamila smiled and said, “The two of you are here on time. You must have finished your work.” ”

Director ma nodded and took out a document from his bag. “This is the document you asked us to look for in Tang Mi’s office.”

Jamila took the document and flipped through a few pages. His eyes were full of satisfaction.

“”You two have worked hard!”After a while, Jamila put the document away and continued, “I have another thing to trouble you two with.” ”

“Director ma smiled obsequiously and said, “If there’s anything, feel free to ask.” ”

“Jamila looked up at director Ma and said, “I heard that YC found volcanic crystals on Mars.” ”

“Volcanic crystals were an important resource that controlled the entire Martian climate and environment. With volcanic crystals, they could also be used to develop power materials! ”

Professor Feng frowned slightly. “You want volcanic crystals?”

“Yes.”Gamila nodded without hiding it.

“Professor Feng felt that Gamila was pushing her luck. They had clearly agreed that she only wanted some secrets about achieving the speed of light, but now, Gamila had actually set her sights on the volcanic crystals. ”

“The volcanic crystals were brought back from Mars by Ye Zhuo. If she really took out the volcanic crystals and gave them to Gamila, it would really be no different from treason! ”

No.

This could not be done.

“Professor Feng said, “The volcanic crystal is a very important thing. It is personally safeguarded by Miss Ye. Normally, we would not be able to come into contact with it at all.” ”

“”Solutions are all thought up by people.”The corners of Jamila’s mouth curled into a smile. She continued, “I believe that as long as you want it, you will definitely be able to get the volcanic crystal and complete the mission perfectly!” ”

“Director ma followed, “Dr. Jamila, Professor Feng Is Right. Don’t look at Ye Zhuoxiao, she actually has a lot of ideas. She is very clever. How could she let us see something as important as the volcano crystal so casually? Don’t you think that you are forcing us to do this?” ”

“Jamila took a sip of coffee and continued, “Director Ma, I believe in your ability! You and professor Feng can even obtain such an important confidential document. It’s just a volcano crystal. You will definitely be able to obtain it too.” ”

Director Ma’s face was full of embarrassment.

He was really in a difficult position!

“The volcanic crystal was the most important thing in the entire base. It could not be duplicated. If ye Zhuo found out that they were the ones who tampered with it, with reference to Tang Xue’s price, they would probably spend the rest of their lives in prison! ”

This was too risky!

“Looking at the expressions on director Ma and Professor Feng’s faces, jamila continued, “Don’t be so nervous, and don’t be so sensitive. Just treat this as a normal mission! We don’t need all the volcanic crystals, as long as you can secretly take some out and use it for research! YC brought back so many volcanic crystals from Mars. It’s just a small amount. YC will definitely not notice.” ”
