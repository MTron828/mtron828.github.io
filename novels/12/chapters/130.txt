Chapter 131: 082: How Does It match up to her? She doesn’t even have the slightest discernment! 4

Old Lady Lin happily grabbed Feng Xianxian’s hand. “Right, right, right. Xianxian is right. We’re family. We don’t speak in different ways! Since we’re family, you’re not allowed to call me grandma Lin Anymore! This is too distant!”

“Ah?”Feng Xianxian pretended to be puzzled and said, “Then what should I call you?”

Old Lady Lin lovingly scratched feng Xianxian’s nose, “You child, you were so smart when you were smart, and you always came first in the exams. How can you be so stupid when you are stupid! If you don’t Call Me Grandma Lin, of course you call me Grandma!”

“Grandma.”Feng Xianxian immediately called out sweetly.

Old Lady Lin was overjoyed. She took out a thick red packet from her pocket, “This is the new year money that Grandma gave you.”

“Thank you, Grandma.”Feng Xianxian took it with both hands and said awkwardly, “But, will brother Ah Ze be unhappy if I call you that? I feel like brother Ah Ze doesn’t like me very much.”

Old Mrs. Lin’s face turned stiff. She immediately thought of what happened last night. “How dare he be unhappy!”

“Grandma, don’t be angry.”Feng Xianxian hugged old Mrs. Lin’s arm, “I was just saying. Actually, brother Ah Ze is very obedient. My mother often praises brother ah ze for being sensible and even wants me to learn more from brother Ah Ze!”

Who Was Feng Xianxian?

She was Feng Qianhua’s daughter.

She knew how to be good to Old Lady Lin, and she also knew how to drive a wedge between them.

What was Lin Ze?

A wild child who didn’t even know who his biological mother was.

What right did he have to compete with her?

Sooner or later, she would ask Old Lady Lin to chase Lin ze away!

Then, she would ask Feng Qianhua to give birth to a younger brother for her.

At that time, she would be the Cen family head’s daughter-in-law, and her younger brother would be the successor of the Lin family.

At that time, in the entire capital, who could compare to her?

Thinking of this, Feng Xianxian’s eyes were filled with pride.

Hearing this, the expression on old madam Lin’s face became even uglier. “If Ah Ze is half as sensible as you, I would be burning incense!”

If Lin Ze was really sensible, he would not have refused to let Feng Qianhua and her daughter come to the Lin family for the New Year Last Night.

To think that Feng Qianhua still liked him so much.

If Lin Ze didn’t look like Lin Jincheng, she would even suspect that Lin Ze was the blood of the Lin family.

“Grandma, don’t Tease Me! How can I compare to Brother Ah Ze?” Feng Qianqian then took out a pair of insoles. “Oh right, grandma, today is the first day of the New Year, and I don’t have anything to give you. This is the insoles that I personally stitched for you, please don’t mind it.”

This pair of insoles was not bought by Feng Xianxian.

Instead, it was three pairs at ten Yuan and was casually bought by the roadside.

The reason why she dared to say that she personally stitched it was because she was relying on the fact that Old Lady Lin would not suspect her.

This old lady was blind.

She was very gullible!

The facts proved that Feng Xianxian was right. Old Lady Lin happily took the insoles. “A thousand miles to give goose feathers, a gift is light and a sentiment is heavy! Xianxian has grown up and knows how to be filial to Grandma!”

What was important was not a pair of insoles, but the fact that Feng Xianxian had personally made the insoles. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

This kind of kindness could not be repaid with a thousand gold coins!

It was already the age of machines now. which young man would be willing to personally sew a pair of insoles for the elderly at home?

This granddaughter!

She did not like it for nothing.

The more old madam Lin thought about it, the happier she became.

Feng Xianxian smiled and said, “Grandma, I’m your granddaughter. Isn’t filial to you something that should be done? When I earn money in the future, I’ll take you around the world to travel! To experience different customs and customs.”

Sure enough, girls were considerate.

Lin Ze, for example, had never said such intimate words to her.

Did the Lin family lack money to travel around the world?

What they lacked was a good child who was filial.

“Okay, okay, okay.”Old Mrs. Lin patted Feng Xianxian’s hand. “Grandma will wait for you to take Grandma around the world.”

Feng xianxian continued, “Oh right, Grandma Lin, where are brother Ah Ze and uncle Lin?”

“They went out to pay new year’s greetings early in the morning. They haven’t come back yet,”said old Mrs. Lin.

Feng Qianhua continued, “Aunt Lin, why haven’t we seen eldest brother, second brother, third brother, and fourth brother come back with sister-in-law and the children?”

Lin Jincheng was the youngest child in the family.

There were four older brothers on it.

Old Mrs. Lin said, “They just called to say that it snowed last night and it’s not easy to walk on the road. They will probably arrive in the afternoon.”

Having not seen her children and grandchildren for a year, Mrs. Lin could not wait to see them.
