Translator: 549690339

“Jiang Xiaoyu grew up together with Zhao Xueyin. Although they were separated for three years, they kept in touch and were as close as sisters. ”

Zhao Xueyin used her.

Did she treat her as a chess piece?

Jiang Xiaoyu’s expression became very ugly.

“After a long while, Jiang Xiaoyu finally reacted. She looked at ye Zhuo’s back and said, “Miss Ye! Wait!” ”

“Is there anything else?”Ye Zao looked back slightly.

“Jiang Xiaoyu continued, “I haven’t thanked you for saving my Grandma Yet! “My Grandma is very grateful to you and specially asked me to come and look for you! “She saw that you liked desserts at the banquet, so I asked me to buy this for you. Please accept it!” ”

“Ye Zao naturally wouldn’t refuse the kindness of an old man in his seventies. He took the box from Jiang Xiaoyu with both hands and said, “Say thank you to Grandma for me.” ”

“We should be the ones thanking you.”

“”Big Zao Zao, my battery is about to run out!”Xiao Bai suddenly said at this moment. ”

Jiang Xiaoyu was stunned and her eyes were filled with curiosity.

“Ye Zao said, “Go back and charge it yourself.” ”

“Okay.”

“Jiang Xiaoyu said in surprise, “Which one is the robot?” ”

“Hearing that, Xiao Bai immediately turned around and acted cute. “Right, right! I’m the smartest and cutest robot in the universe, ye Bai! But my battery is out now! I Won’t talk to you anymore! Bye!” ”

Jiang Xiaoyu’s face was full of surprise.

“She was usually quite interested in robots, so when she went abroad to study, she specially chose Z country. ”

“However, in the technologically advanced Z country, she had never seen such an intelligent robot. She didn’t expect to see one in China! ”

“At this moment, Jiang Xiaoyu only had one thought! ”

That was!

To immediately have an identical robot!

“Jiang Xiaoyu turned to look at ye Zao. “Miss Ye, I’m sorry. I really like that robot of yours. May I ask where it was bought?” ”

“Ye Zao continued, “I assembled it myself.” ”

Assembled it himself?

The look in Jiang Xiaoyu’s eyes almost turned into stars!

Ye Zao was too amazing!

He could actually assemble such an intelligent robot!

Jiang Xiaoyu covered her mouth. “Miss Ye! You’re really amazing! No wonder the television said that you could build an aircraft carrier!”

“Thank you.”Ye Zao looked up at the sky. “Do you want to come in and have a cup of tea?”

“”Yes, yes! Thank you, Miss Ye! You’re Too Kind, Miss Ye!” ”

Ye Zao:”...”she was really just being polite. She didn’t expect Jiang Xiaoyu to treat her like an outsider.

She came into the house.

She saw that Whitey was charging in the corner.

“Jiang Xiaoyu came into the house and looked at Whitey from left to right, up and down, left and right, as if she had discovered a new world. ”

“At this moment, brother Meow, who was in Whitey’s pocket, suddenly stuck his head out. ”

“Meow!”

“Facing the sudden big head, Jiang Xiaoyu was so scared that she took a few steps back. She patted her heart and said, “F * ck! F * ck! There’s a cat on the robot!” ”

“At this moment, ye Zao walked over with a cup in his hand. “I can’t sleep with tea tonight. Have a cup of Coke.” ”

“Thank you.”Jiang Xiaoyu took the cup from ye Zao with both hands.

“After taking a sip of the coke, Jiang Xiaoyu continued, “Miss Ye, is that Cat Real?” ”

“”Yes, it’s real.”Ye Zao nodded slightly. ”

“”Then, then can I pet it?”Jiang Xiaoyu asked. ”

“Yes.”

“With Ye Zao’s permission, Jiang Xiaoyu carefully stretched out a finger and poked brother Meow’s head. ”

“Meow!”

Brother Meow rubbed Jiang Xiaoyu’s hand.

“Jiang Xiaoyu said excitedly, “It’s real! This cat is really real!” ”

Ye Zao sat on the sofa and drank coke while opening the dessert that Jiang Xiaoyu brought.

It was a very exquisite mousse ice cream cake.

There was also a layer of cocoa powder on it.

It looked very delicious.

“Ye Zao took a knife and cut a piece of cake. “Miss Jiang, do you want to eat a piece of dessert?” ”

“Jiang Xiaoyu ran over with a snort. “Miss Ye, you can just call me by my name! My name is Jiang Xiaoyu!” ”

“Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Then, do you want to eat dessert?” ”

“It’s too late.”Jiang Xiaoyu waved her hand and refused. “It’s easy to get fat if you eat at night!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Since Jiang Xiaoyu didn’t eat, ye Zao could only enjoy the delicious food alone. ”

“Seeing ye Zao eat so well, Jiang Xiaoyu swallowed her saliva. ”

She would eat like ye Zao Tomorrow in the daytime!

She would eat two big pieces!

No!

Three big pieces!

Yes!

It was three big pieces.

“In order to stop her stomach from being tortured, Jiang Xiaoyu continued, “Miss Ye, you’re busy. I’ll go back First!” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Before he left, Jiang Xiaoyu even ran over to give brother Meow a hug. Then, she patted Whitey’s shoulder. “I’m leaving. Goodbye.” ”

The next day arrived in the blink of an eye.

Ye Zhuo went to work at the consortium as usual.

There was an early morning meeting in the morning.

Ye Zhuo entered the office at a certain time.

“Zhao Xueyin glanced at Ye Zhuo. “Since everyone is here, let’s start the early meeting. Let me say a few words first...” ”

Ye Zao sat in his chair.

His posture was a little casual.

There was no expression on his face.

“From the lawyer’s perspective, he could just see the side of her face. ”

The lawyer’s gaze was very heavy.

Zhao Xueyin just happened to catch this scene.

The lawyer was actually looking at ye Zao!

Why was he looking at ye Zao?

“Zhao Xueyin was burning with anger, but she still looked calm as she looked at ye Zao, “President Ye, I heard that you read the financial statements for the entire afternoon yesterday. Do you have anything to tell us? Or, have you come up with a solution to the financial problem?” ”

“According to Aili, Ye Zhuo finished reading in less than an hour. ”

What could she see!

A summary and a solution?

It was more like a disgrace.

“I was about to tell everyone about this.”Ye Zhuo stood up slightly and walked to Zhao Xueyin’s side. “Let me use the computer.”

“Use it.”Zhao Xueyin smiled slightly. She wanted to see what ye Zhuo could say.

Ye Zhuo inserted the USB drive that he had prepared into the USB port and opened the powerpoint.

“In the next second, the contents of the computer were all displayed on the big screen behind him. ”

“”Everyone, please look at the big screen.”Ye Zhuo controlled the mouse. “Here, here, these are all the questions that I have concluded from looking at the financial statements. Why did our financial group’s stock fall so much in just a short ten years...” ”

“Every word that ye Zhuo said was deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. It was clear and orderly, so no one could find any mistakes. ”

“After he finished speaking, everyone looked at each other and saw the shock in each other’s eyes. ”

Amazing!

Really Too Amazing!

“If they hadn’t seen it with their own eyes, no one would believe that this plan and conclusion were made by Ye Zhuo. ”

Such a comparison.

Zhao Xueyin wasn’t just slightly inferior to Ye Zhuo.

“President Ye is right. We really should do it.”

“”President Ye, I Support Your Plan!” ”

“I support it too!”

“In the blink of an eye, two-thirds of the people in the meeting room raised their hands. ”

Zhao Xueyin was stunned.

She was going to watch ye Zhuo make a fool of himself.

She didn’t expect ye Zhuo to be so well-prepared.

Who was the one who made this plan for her?

Elder Zhang?

“Zhao Xueyin pinched her fingers, feeling very uncomfortable. ”

“After a moment, Zhao Xueyin calmed down and continued, “Everyone, this plan does look good, but in the end, it’s just talk on paper...” ”

“I don’t think it’s talk on paper!”

“I don’t think so either!”

“”Miss Zhao, this is clearly a feasible plan. Please don’t bring your personal feelings into the work.” ”

“Zhao Xueyin took a deep breath and turned to look at the lawyer. “Chairman of the company, what do you think?” ”

“The lawyer was young and promising, and he had a lot of prestige in the financial group. ”

“As long as the lawyer said no, everyone would definitely support the lawyer. ”

“And the lawyer liked her so much, he would definitely support her. ”
