“Got it.”Man Jiangshan nodded.

“Zhao dan continued, “Oh right, I’ve already thought about it. After i recognize ye Zao, I’ll think of a way to get her to give up the position of young master Dongli’s fiancée! “I can finally see that she’s not the least bit malleable, and she doesn’t have the bearing of a mother! “If she really takes that position, I’m afraid that she won’t be able to see us in the future!” ”

“If ye Zhuo dared to ignore his family now, what would happen in the future? In order to prevent future trouble and for the future of Manxing, in Zhao Dan’s opinion, there was no one else who was qualified to take that position other than Manxing. ”

“Man Jiangshan turned to look at Zhao Dan. “I’m afraid this matter isn’t that simple, is it?” ”

“After all, there were so many people behind ye Zhuo who supported her. ”

It was really not easy to snatch the thing from ye Zhuo’s hands.

“Zhao Dan said, “Xing ‘er is her closest sister. Why should the two sisters be separated from each other? Besides, what do you think Xing ‘Er is worse than her?” ”

“Not only was man Xing not worse than Ye Zhuo, he was also many times better than her. ”

“Speaking up to this point, Zhao Dan continued, “When the time comes, you just have to cooperate with me.” ”

“”Okay.”Seeing that Zhao Dan knew what to do, man Jiangshan did not ask further. ”

“After all, he did not have any feelings for his daughter, Ye Zhuo. ”

He just had to make the best use of everything.

“On the Xing Net, everyone was waiting for Ye Zhuo’s reply and statement. ”

“However, ye Zao’s side was calm and peaceful, and there was no reply at all. ”

“Zhao Dan took this opportunity to post a video of an apology, putting pressure on Ye Zao. ”

“Just when everyone thought that ye Zao would not reply, Ye Zao had his assistant post this message on the star network: ”

“[ regarding the recent family identification incident on the Star Network, Miss Ye entrusted me to make an explanation on the star network: 1, she has nothing to do with Manxing country. 2. She has biological parents and an older brother. The four of them live very happily together and do not wish for anyone to disturb them. 3. Please, Mr. and Mrs. Manman of Manxing, do not do any more slander or damage miss ye’s reputation. Otherwise, see you in the Intergalactic Court. ] ”

“Once this statement was made, it undoubtedly increased the anger of the crowd. ”

See You in the Intergalactic Court?

Who was he trying to scare?

“When Zhao Dan saw this statement, he immediately laughed out loud. “See you in the intergalactic court. Jiangshan, what do you think?” ”

“Jiangshan turned around and looked at Zhao Dan. “Of course, I’ll accompany you at any time. We still have to do another paternity test.” ”

“You’re right.”Zhao Dan nodded.

“Originally, there was no need to do the paternity test. ”Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“After all, they would never mistake their own daughter. ”

“But now that things had developed to this extent, the paternity test had to be done. ”

“Zhao dan continued, “Then I’ll make a statement?” ”

“Yes.”Man Jiangshan nodded.

“Zhao Dan immediately made a statement, “Since things have developed to this extent, we can only respect Miss Ye’s wishes. We’ll see you in the intergalactic court. If Miss Ye doesn’t believe that she’s our daughter, we can do the paternity test.” ”

“Before the paternity test, how does leaf burn still deny? ”

“Tears streamed down Zhao Dan’s face, “In fact, this is what neither of us want to see. Yueh-erh, we are family, and you are our daughter. What is it that we can not say when we sit together as a family? If you don’t want to admit us, we just want answers, we just want you to have a better life than we thought… … .. ”

[ sob sob… Mrs. Man is really too kind! ]

“[ as a parent, to be able to do this, Mr. and Mrs. Man really have nothing to say. I hope ye Zao can wake up in time. ] ”

[ does ye Zao Dare to go to the Galactic Court to accept the paternity test? ]

[ I guess she definitely doesn’t dare to go! ]

“However, Zhao Dan was not worried at all that ye Zao would not go. ”

“If ye Zao did not go, he would be tacitly admitting that she was their daughter. ”

“If ye Zao went, there would only be one outcome. ”

Face reality.

“At this moment, there was a knock on the door. ”

Zhao Dan put away his thoughts. “Come in.”

Man Xing walked in from outside. “Mom.”

“Why is Xing ‘er here?”Zhao Dan stood up.

“MAN XING continued, “Mom, I saw the statement on the starnet. Aren’t you forcing elder sister into a corner by doing this? In my opinion, why don’t we just forget about it? You should quickly make a statement and say that you’ve got the wrong person. Miss Ye isn’t elder sister. She has nothing to do with elder sister.” ”

“Zhao Dan was a little speechless as he said, “My silly daughter. You’re so good to her. has she ever thanked you in the slightest? You Don’t have to care about this matter. Just leave it to me.” ”

“But…”

“Zhao dan directly interrupted manxing, “Don’t be a ‘but’. Xing ‘er, let me tell you, a kind person will be bullied by others! If a person is too kind, he or she will be ridden to the top by others!”For example, the current Manxing.., although Manxing had been so good to Ye Zhuo, Ye Zhuo had never been grateful, much less remembered that she had a younger sister. As long as ye Zhuo had a younger sister like Manxing in his heart, he would not turn a blind eye to Manxing. ”

“Seeing Zhao Dan like this, man Xing sighed helplessly. “Mom, are we really going to fight with elder sister in the Intergalactic Court?” ”

“Once the intergalactic court met, what faced ye Zao would be the law and obligations. ”

“At that time, even if she did not recognize man Jiangshan and Zhao Dan, the law would not allow it. Ye Zao might even be imprisoned because of it. ”

“”Xing ‘er, don’t say anymore. Mom knows that you are a good sister and does not want to see your elder sister punished. However, filial piety is the first priority. Our S galaxy is the galaxy that values filial piety the most. If she, Ye Zao, dares to disown her parents and younger sister, she should be punished for this!” ”

“On the other side, in the General Alliance. ”

The assistant immediately told ye Zao about this news.

Ye Zao looked up slightly. “Paternity test?”

“Looking at the entire galaxy, it seemed like they wanted to use the paternity test to tie her up. ”

Unfortunately.

They had miscalculated.

“Yes.”The assistant nodded.

Ye Zao drank a mouthful of black tea. “How’s the investigation on Li Man coming along?”

“”We haven’t found anything yet,”the assistant continued. “After that incident, Li Man completely disappeared from Galaxy S…” ”

“Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Help me contact lawyer Shangguan. Also, inform Manxing Country that we’ll meet at the interstellar court at 8 am on Friday.” ”
