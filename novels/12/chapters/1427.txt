“Using a nuclear reactor as power material, how could this not happen?”

It was thanks to ye Zao that he thought of it.

“Xiao Lu continued, “Sister Xue, I heard that if the nuclear reactor leaks, it will be very troublesome. How Do You Think Ye Zao will end this?””

“”Nonsense! This is simply nonsense!”Tang Xue continued, “Xu Guo, you and Xiao Lu stay in the laboratory. I’ll go out for a while. I’ll be back soon.””

“Got it.”Xu Guo nodded.

“Looking at Tang Xue’s back, Xiao Lu asked curiously, “What do you think Sister Xue is doing?””

“Xu Guo had been in the base for some years. “She should have gone to ask for help. After all, a nuclear reactor malfunction is not a small problem. Once it is leaked, the entire base will suffer!””

Xiao Lu was stunned. “It’s that serious?”

“What do you think!”

Xu Guo was right. Tang Xue had indeed gone to ask for help. She knew an expert who studied nuclear reactors. An expert would definitely be able to solve the problem of a nuclear reactor malfunction.

This expert was from the same generation as Tang Xue’s grandfather. He was already in his eighties this year and had already retired for ten years. Only she had the face to ask for help from him.

“If it was someone else, it really wouldn’t be possible.”

“But halfway through, Tang Xue’s footsteps slowed down, and her emotions also slowly calmed down.”

No.

She couldn’t ask for help so quickly.

“Someone like ye Zhuo should let her learn a lesson. It was best to take this opportunity to drive her out of the Cen family base, so as to avoid causing more trouble and implicating the entire base.”

“After thinking for a moment, Tang Xue turned around and walked towards Professor Yue’s office.”

...

“When Ye Zhuo received Cen Jiang’s call, she was on her way to ZY Technology’s press conference.”

“Is there a problem with the nuclear reactor?”

“”Yes, Miss Ye.”Cen Jiang’s tone was very anxious. “Big C area is already very busy. Please come over quickly!””

“”Don’t panic. I’ll be right there.”Ye Zao’s eyebrows were still the same. The winter sunlight shone in from the window, casting a layer of cold light on her face.”

“It was clearly a very faint voice, but it passed through the phone screen and made Cen Jiang feel inexplicably at ease.”

“After hanging up the phone, ye Zao turned to look at the driver. “Master, please go ahead to 1988 Yan ‘an Road.””

“The driver was stunned. “Young Lady, you’re not going to the airport?””

“”Yes, I have something urgent to attend to, so I won’t be going.””

“”Alright.”The taxi driver nodded. “1988 Yan ‘an Road, right?””

“”Yes.”Ye Zhuo continued, “Sir, I’m a little anxious, so I’ll trouble you to speed up a little.””

“The middle-aged driver said, “Young lady, it’s rush hour now. There are too many cars on the road, and I’m already at my fastest speed!””

“Although the speed was already very fast, it was still too slow for ye Zao.”

The nuclear reactor matter could not be delayed.

“Ye Zao continued, “I’ll have to trouble you to go faster.””

“The driver was a little impatient. “Young Lady, don’t rush me anymore. I’m already going as fast as I can. If it really doesn’t work, the steering wheel is here. You Drive.””

Ye Zao looked like she was not an adult yet. She probably could not even tell the accelerator from the brake. How could she drive?

The little girl nowadays only knew how to rush people with her mouth open. She did not know that it was impossible to drive fast in this kind of road condition.

“Pull over.”Ye Zao’s red lips opened slightly.

“The driver asked curiously, “You’re not going to sit?””

“”I’ll drive,”ye Zao said.”

She’ll Drive?

The driver was amused when he heard this.

This little girl was really interesting. She even dared to say such words and leisurely pulled over.

He wanted to see if this little girl really dared to drive!

“The car has stopped. You Can Drive!”The middle-aged driver turned to look at ye Zao.

“When he turned around, the seat was already empty. Just as he was puzzled, someone knocked on the left window. The middle-aged driver turned around and saw that it was ye Zao.”

“The driver was stunned for a moment before he opened the door. “Young, Young Lady, are you serious?””

“”Master, I’m in a hurry right now. I don’t have time to joke with you.”After he said that, he took out his driver’s license and handed it to the driver. “This is my driver’s license.””

The driver took the driver’s license and walked to the front passenger seat.

“When he sat in the front passenger seat, he was completely stunned.”

Ye Zhuo started the engine. “Put on your seatbelt.”

“The middle-aged driver was stunned for a moment before he realized what was going on. He had been driving for so many years, but this was the first time someone had reminded him to put on his seatbelt.”

This feeling was quite strange!
