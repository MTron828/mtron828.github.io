Bai Mo’s strength seemed to have been sucked away in an instant.

She cried so much that she could not control herself.

She did not understand why she had come to this point.

She was clearly born into a noble family and was the favored daughter of heaven.

Why would fate play such a joke on her.

“After crying for a long time, Bai Mo finally stopped. She raised her head and looked at the people coming and going, her eyes filled with sorrow. ”

She was born noble. When had she ever experienced such a thing.

“Although it was only a few days, she had experienced the darkest things in her life. ”

The current her could not go back to the s galaxy.

Earth... seemed to have no place for her.

What should she do?

“At this moment, Bai Mo thought of Liu Chao. ”

Should she really give herself to Liu Chao?

No.

She wasn’t willing.

“But if she didn’t look for Liu Chao, she had no other choice. ”

“She didn’t have an ID card, no household register... ”

“Bai Mo sat on the ground in a daze. In the end, she decided to look for Liu Chao. ”

Finding Liu Chao was better than starving to death.

“As long as she was alive, there was hope of returning. As long as she returned to s galaxy, she could take revenge. ”

She couldn’t die.

She absolutely couldn’t die.

“Although her parents didn’t know that she had come to Earth, Bai Yuanyuan knew that if Bai Yuanyuan found out that she couldn’t contact her, she would definitely tell her parents. At that time, she could return to the s galaxy. ”

“As long as she could return to the s galaxy, what was the point of enduring humiliation? ”

“The great ancestor of the Ming dynasty, Zhu Yuanzhang, was once a beggar when he ascended to the throne. ”

“Thinking of this, Bai Mo stood up from the ground and walked towards the intersection. ”

Liu Chao’s place was not far from here. It would take about half an hour to walk.

“Although it would only take half an hour to walk, Bai Mo was too tired and walked for about forty minutes before he reached Liu Chao’s place. ”

The door was closed.

Bai Mo reached out and knocked on the door.

“Very soon, the door was opened from the inside. ”

The person who opened the door was really Liu Chao.

“When Liu Chao saw Bai Mo, he was not surprised. “Have you thought it through?” ”

Bai Mo did not say anything and just nodded.

“Are You Mute?”Liu Chao continued to speak. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Knowing that Liu Chao was deliberately trying to make things difficult for her, Bai Mo could only swallow her anger. “I’ve thought it through.” ”

“At this moment, Bai Mo did not expect that she would have such a day even in her dreams. ”

Bai Jingshu!

“One day, she would make Bai Jingshu pay the price. ”

“Liu Chao looked at Bai mo. “Since you know you’re wrong, shouldn’t you do something to show your sincerity?” ”

“What do you want me to do?”Bai Mo looked up at Liu Chao.

Liu Chao raised his hand and slapped Bai Mo’s face. “Who are you showing your dead face to?”

Slap.

“With a crisp slap, the right side of Bai Mo’s face turned red and swollen, and blood seeped out from the corner of her mouth. ”

It was very painful.

“Bai Mo bit her lip and wanted to resist, but she was nothing now, so she could only bite off her teeth and swallow the blood. ”

“”I know I’m wrong,”Bai Mo continued. ”

Liu Chao nodded in satisfaction. “Come in.”

“Bai Mo followed Liu Chao’s footsteps. The two-bedroom, one-living room was no different from the last time Bai Mo came. ”

“Liu Chao sat on the sofa and said to Bai Mo, “Go and wash my clothes in the bathroom.” ”

WASH clothes?

Did Earth not even have a washing machine?

Bai Mo’s eyes were filled with disbelief.

“Seeing that Bai Mo did not move for a long time, Liu Chao continued, “Bai Mo, are you deaf?” ”

“Bai Mo was stunned and instantly reacted. “I, I know.” ”

“After saying that, she walked into the bathroom. ”

“Bai Mo’s body was delicate and precious. Other than the suffering she had suffered on earth these past few days, she had not personally done anything. ”

How could she know how to wash clothes?

“Moreover, Liu Chao’s clothes were dirty and smelly. ”

“Although Bai Mo was extremely unwilling, she had already fallen to such a state. She could only continue to endure humiliation and live. ”

“Anything that she did not know how to do, when she was forced into a corner, she could only never show up. ”

Bai Mo found the laundry detergent and imitated what she saw on the television. She started to do the laundry.

“After doing the laundry with great difficulty, Liu Chao thought about sitting on the sofa to rest for a while. Then, he said, “I’m hungry. Go and Cook.” ”

This Bai Mo really did not know how to do it.

“Bai Mo looked at Liu Chao. “I, I don’t know how to do it.” ”

“Liu Chao continued, “If you don’t know how to cook, then come with me. I’ll teach you how to cook noodles. From now on, cook a bowl of noodles and fry an egg every morning.” ”

Bai Mo followed behind Liu Chao without saying a word.

Liu Chao walked into the kitchen and began to teach Bai Mo how to cook noodles.
