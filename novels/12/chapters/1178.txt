Translator: 549690339

Ye Zao was Qian Jiu?

How was that possible?

How could ye Zao Be Qian Jiu?

“Upon hearing this, Zhao Xueyin was immediately stunned. She thought that she had heard wrongly. ”

“After a long while, Zhao Xueyin finally reacted. She turned around and looked at Rebecca. The corners of her mouth curled up into a smile. “Miss, Miss Rebecca, don’t joke around!” ”

It Won’t happen!

Joke.

It must be a joke!

“For someone like ye Zao, she couldn’t even compare to a single strand of hair from siqian! ”

She was siqian?

It was simply a fantasy!

Zhao Xueyin comforted herself in her heart.

“”Joke?”Rebecca said very seriously, “Miss Ye, I’m not joking around with you. This is indeed the boss of our studio, Siqian.” ”

Not joking?

Zhao Xueyin’s face immediately turned pale.

She could not believe this fact.

“If ye Zhuo was drinking lightly, then what was she? ”

A Clown?

“Zhao Xueyin bit her lip tightly, her entire body drenched in cold sweat. “No, no, she’s not drinking lightly, she’s Not!” ”

“Drinking lightly became famous a year ago, designing the national seal for Country P. ”

“As a result, she had appeared on international news and became famous in one fell swoop. ”

“Unfortunately, she had kept a low profile and had never revealed her true colors in front of the media. As a result, no one had ever seen what Qian Zhuo looked like. ”

How Old Was Ye Zhuo?

How could she have the ability to design the national seal?

Zhao Xueyin had previously investigated ye Zhuo. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Ye Zhuo’s greatest achievement was that he had obtained the world’s first place in last year’s science and technology competition. He was the scientific and Technological World’s Dr. YC.

“If ye Zao was Qian You, how could she not have found out? ”

“Therefore, Ye Zao was definitely not Qian You! ”

Rebecca did not know the reason for this. She only thought that Zhao Xueyin was surprised that ye Zao was too young.

“After all, when she first saw ye Zao, she did not dare to believe that ye Zao was Qian You. ”

“Qian you had achieved so much. Before she saw ye Zao, Rebecca had always thought that ye Zao was an elderly person. ”

“Rebecca said very seriously, “Miss Zhao, I’m really not joking with you!” ”

“After saying that, Rebecca turned to look at Ye Zhuo again and continued, “Boss, this is Miss Zhao who has an appointment with you at three in the afternoon.” ”

“”Miss Zhao?”Ye Zhuo frowned slightly and looked at the schedule, “Rebecca, what’s Going On?” ”

The schedule showed that the appointment this afternoon was made by Mr. Yang.

“Mr. Yang suddenly turned into Zhao Xueyin, and Ye Zhuo was also a little surprised. ”

“Rebecca quickly explained, “Boss, Mr. Yang helped to make the appointment for Miss Zhao. So the person who came to see you is Miss Zhao.” ”

“Make the appointment for you?”Ye Zhuo frowned slightly.

“Seeing ye Zhuo like this, Rebecca’s heart skipped a beat. ”

“In fact, there had been many cases of making appointments for her before, but this time, Ye Zhuo was obviously angry. ”

“”It can’t be...”Zhao Xueyin still couldn’t believe it. Her voice trembled as she said, “How is it possible! How can ye Zhuo Be Qian You? How can she match it?” ”

PA —

The dessert in her hand fell to the ground.

“Zhao Xueyin couldn’t care about anything else. She grabbed Rebecca’s hand directly. “Miss Rebecca! Tell me, you’re joking, right? ! She’s not Qian You! She’s Not!”Zhao Xueyin was on the verge of breaking down. She was really on the verge of breaking down. ”

She originally wanted to use the matter of gin to show off in front of the board of directors.

She wanted to let everyone know her strength.

She didn’t expect...

She didn’t expect reality to make such a joke with her.

“”She’s not our boss, could it be that you are?”Rebecca flung Zhao Xueyin’s hand away with a cold face, “Miss Zhao, you’re not welcome here. Please leave immediately!” ”

“Zhao Xueyin’s face turned from white to pale white, and her entire body was drenched in cold sweat. ”

It really was!

Ye Zao was really drinking a little.

Only now did Zhao Xueyin dare to believe that ye Zao was drinking a little.

Zhao Xueyin’s entire body was trembling slightly.

Why?

Why was ye Zao drinking a little?

“Ten minutes ago, she was still feeling honored to be able to make an appointment for drinking a little. ”

“She did not expect that ten minutes later, reality would give her such a heavy blow. ”

So what if she knew Qian Zhuo?

Ye Zhuo was Qian Zhuo himself!

This was a huge humiliation for Zhao Xueyin!

It was worse than killing her.

“Zhao Xueyin raised her head to look at Ye Zhuo, her lips trembling. “You, you did it on purpose! You deliberately humiliated me!” ”

Ye Zhuo knew that she had made an appointment with Qian Zhuo.

But he did not say a word.

He deliberately wanted to see her make a fool of herself!

Ye Zao Must Be Very Proud Now!

She’s like a fool!

A fool played by Ye Zao.

Disgusting.

Ye Zao is simply too disgusting!

Why would there still be such a disgusting person in the world?
