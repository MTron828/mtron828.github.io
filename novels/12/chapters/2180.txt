“However, at that time, she and man Jiangshan rejected ye Zao. ”

Ye Zao must have held a grudge against them since then.

“She wanted revenge, so she found someone to put on such a show. ”

Ye Zao’s scheming was too deep!

“Hearing this, Ye Zao did not get angry. He just looked at Zhao Dan, “The law will always be in place. Who is the one who got angry out of humiliation, the real culprit behind the scenes? The witnesses and physical evidence I brought today will tell everyone the truth.” ”

Li Man was dead.

Li Man was dead!

“Zhao Dan comforted himself in his heart, telling himself not to be nervous. All of this was a trick used by Ye Zhuo to deceive others. ”

“At this moment, Li man seemed to have read Zhao Dan’s mind. She turned slightly and said, “Madam, you must be very curious. Why Am I still alive?” ”

“Hearing Li Man’s voice again, Zhao Dan tried his best to calm himself down, he looked at Li man and said, “I don’t know you at all! I don’t know what you’re talking about! I’m warning you, perjury has a price to pay. You better think it through! Don’t regret it later!” ”

“Li Man looked at the judge. “Mr. Judge, I can guarantee with my personality that everything I said today is true. I can also bear any legal responsibility for my words and actions!” ”

“At this point.., li man continued, “My Name Is Li Man. I’m from Manxing, and I’m 65 years old this year. “The video that Miss Ye played just now was all true because it was the Li Man in the video. Back then, I was the one who personally sent the full moon princess to the Eternal Glacier.” ”

“Shut up! You Shut Up! I don’t even know you!”Zhao Dan directly interrupted Li Man’s unfinished words.

She couldn’t continue!

Zhao Dan had a premonition that this Li man was very likely the Li Man from back then.

“Li Man turned her head, and the corners of her mouth curled up. “Since you said that you don’t know me, Why Are You So Guilty? Can’t you wait for me to finish speaking?”? ”

“”I just put the full moon princess in the Eternal Glacier when I was ambushed by assassins. Do you dare to say that those assassins weren’t sent by you and Sir?”Li Man had been indebted to Zhao Dan in her middle age, so she was very loyal to Zhao Dan, however, she never expected that the couple would send assassins to understand her. “The heavens are watching what you did back then. It’s time for retribution for what you did back then!” ”

“Man Xing looked at Zhao Dan and then at the entire country. He felt that something was very wrong. If things continued to develop like this, he would lose 3,000 men if he failed to kill the enemy. He got up from his seat, “Comrade judge, I have a question to ask this Ms. Long who calls herself Ms. Li Man.” ”

“”Please Ask.”The judge looked at Li Man again. “Li Man, you have the right to choose whether to answer or not.” ”

“Okay.”Li Man nodded.

“Man Xing looked at Li Man, he asked, “Excuse me, this lady. You said that my parents sent assassins to hunt you down. If that’s really the case, you are already a dead person who can’t speak. Why are you standing here safe and sound?”Although man Xing’s sentence was short, it also revealed another problem. ”

“Manjiangshan and Zhao Dan were Manxing country’s president and Madam President. If the two of them really sent assassins, how could a woman like Li Man Survive? ”

It was obvious that Li man was lying.

There was no assassin at all.

“As soon as she said this, the audience began to discuss among themselves, questioning the authenticity of Li Man’s words. ”

“Li Man faced the crowd and continued to speak, “The reason why I was able to survive until now was because the leader of the assassins happened to be an old acquaintance of mine. He was also the one who told me not to show my face in public for the next ten years, or else I would definitely die. It was also because of this reason that I hid outside for nineteen years! Until today!” ”

“She hid outside for nineteen years, and she had been worried for nineteen years. ”

“During these nineteen years, she had been constantly repenting. ”

That was a living being!

“Three days after throwing away the full moon, she had secretly gone to the Eternal Glacier to collect the corpse of the full moon. She had already killed a human life with her own hands, so she couldn’t let her corpse be left in the wilderness. ”

“But by the time she went to the Eternal Glacier, there was no longer any sign of the full moon there. ” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“The conditions of the eternal glacier were harsh, and there were often fierce beasts going in and out. Without seeing the full moon, Li Man thought that the full moon had been eaten by the exotic beasts! ”

“In the days that followed, she would often dream of the full moon covered in blood demanding her life. She would cry and ask her why she had been so heartless as to throw her away! ”

How could she not feel guilty after doing such a shameful thing?
