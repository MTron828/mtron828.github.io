“”My son is right. This time, I have indeed thought too much.”However, this was also because ye Zhuo’s ability was too terrifying. ”

“Over the years, Ye Zhuo had practically dominated changyue. From a little orphan girl who had nothing, she had become the commanding officer Ye. It had only taken her a few years. ”

It was enough to make people’s expressions change!

“This time, when she suddenly saw someone who looked similar to ye Zhuo and had the same name as ye Zhuo, she had no choice but to make autumn town raise their guard. ”

“Qiu Di glanced at Qiu Changzhen and said, “Father, I’ll be going back first.” ” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Okay.”Qiu Changzhen nodded.

“Qiu Di had just walked to the door when Wu Han, who was guarding outside, followed her footsteps. ”

“Has there been any news about the eastern fence young master?”Qiu Di asked.

“”Not yet,”Wu Han said. ”

“Hearing this, Qiu di frowned slightly. “Continue to keep an eye on him. Once there is any news, remember to inform me immediately.” ”

“Okay.”Wu Han nodded.

“Qiu Di looked at Wu Han, who was even more loyal than a dog, and a glimmer of light flashed across her eyes. ”

“She really wanted to personally show ye Zao What kind of face Wu Han, who had once been loyal to her, had now. ”

It was a pity.

Ye Zao would not be able to see it.

As for Wu Han...

He could only be her dog for the rest of her life.

“Thinking of this, Qiu Di’s heart burned with an unprecedented sense of superiority. ”

“Ye Zhuo had trampled on her for so many years. This time, she had finally trampled on ye Zhuo under her feet. ”

“Soon, the two of them arrived at the intelligence department. ”

Qiu Di walked inside while Wu Han waited outside.

“Wu Han was merely Qiu Di’s dog. He was not qualified to enter and leave together with Qiu Di. Therefore, no matter where Qiu Di went, Wu Han was only qualified to stand outside and wait for her. ”

No matter if it was sunny or rainy.

“For example, right now, there was corrosive acid rain in the sky, but Wu Han could only wait outside the door. He was not even qualified to hold an umbrella. ”

The passers-by frowned slightly. They were all guessing the relationship between Wu Han and Qiu Di!

“After all, Wu Han’s ability was not low. If he were to leave Qiu Di, he would definitely be able to create his own business. However, Wu Han did not. No matter how Qiu di treated Wu Han, Wu Han was still loyal and devoted, he never said the word ‘no’. ”

“Look at how Pitiful Wu Han is.”

“Look at how Miss Qiu is usually quite kind. Why is she so harsh towards Wu Han?”

“”Actually, it can’t be considered pitiful. After all, the two of them are willing to fight each other.” ”

“”It’s also because Wu Han is amazing. I have to sleep at home for a few days in this acid rain. Look at Wu Han, he’s fine!” ”

“...”

“Actually, it wasn’t that Wu Han was fine. It was just that he endured it and didn’t show it. Autumn flute was his benefactor. He couldn’t let autumn flute down. ”

“Autumn flute had been in there for two whole hours. During these two hours, Wu Han just stood outside the door, his posture straight. ”

Autumn flute narrowed his eyes.

A dog was a dog.

“Without the owner’s order, he didn’t dare to move. ”

“Let’s go.”Qiu Di walked over.

“Yes.”Wu Han followed Qiu Di’s footsteps.

Cen Shaoqing came to Mars.

“Ever since Yu Zifei and Li Xiang’s accident, the base had activated the most advanced defense system. The security was tight, and there were no more abnormalities. ”

Cen Shaoqing came all the way to the laboratory. “Where’s the black box on the aircraft?”

“Cen Hu said, “The black box has already been corroded. What’s left at the scene is a pile of solidified liquid.” ”

“”Bring it over,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“Okay.”Cen Hu jogged over to get the liquid from the black box.

...

Lin family manor.

“After ye Zhuo returned, he had a strange dream. ”

“In the dream, she seemed to have returned to her past life, but the scene in the dream was very unfamiliar. ”

She stood in front of the hospital bed.

On the pure white hospital bed lay a little boy.

“He was clearly standing very close, but ye Zao could not see his face clearly. ”

“”Forget the past, you will be ye Han from now on.” ”

Ye Han.

Who Was Ye Han?

“When this name came out of Ye Zao’s mouth, Ye Zao’s head suddenly hurt as if it had exploded, and layers and layers of cold sweat appeared on his forehead. ”

Ye Han...

“Ye Han!”Ye Zao cried out in shock. He sat up from the bed and realized that he had been dreaming.

“”Great Zao Zao, Are You Alright?”Xiao Bai put down rolling and slid to the side of the bed. ”

Ye Zao pressed his temples. “How long have I slept?”

“”Five hours,”Xiao Bai said. ”

Five hours...

“Ye Zao turned his eyes to look out of the window and continued, “Go and pour me a cup of black tea.” ”

“Seeing that ye Zhuo didn’t look too well, Xiaobai didn’t dare to joke with her and went to get the black tea. ”

“Ye Zhuo sat on the bed, deep in thought. ”

She suspected that she had forgotten some memories.

Ye Han was definitely not just a character in her dream.

But who was ye Han?

What was the memory that she was missing?

Why couldn’t she remember anything?

“”Big Burning, the black tea you asked for.”Just then, little white glided over with the black tea. ”
