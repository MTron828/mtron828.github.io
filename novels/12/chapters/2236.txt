Bai Yuanyuan looked at Bai Jingshu with doubt in her eyes. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

This Bai Jingshu really thought she was a fool!

How could she be so gullible!

“However, since Bai Jingshu said so, Bai Yuanyuan couldn’t directly expose her, she smiled and said, “Then Grandpa is really unfair. He prepared a level three armored beast Bloodstone for US and gave you a marriage talisman. Don’t you feel anything at all?” ”

“”It’s nothing to be angry about,”Bai Jingshu said with a smile. ”

She didn’t lie. She really didn’t care about these things.

Bai Yuanyuan looked at Bai Jingshu with a sarcastic look in her eyes.

This Bai Jingshu was quite a hypocrite!

“If Old Master Bai really only gave her a marriage talisman, she would have exploded in anger long ago. How could Bai Jingshu still be so calm now? ”

It was obvious that old master Bai had given Bai Jingshu something even better.

“Bai Yuanyuan said in a strange tone, “Then sister Jingshu, you are really magnanimous. If it were me, I would definitely be angry. We are both granddaughters, why can’t grandfather be a little more fair?” ”

Bai Jingshu could hear the strange tone in Bai Yuanyuan’s words and did not explain further.

“Bai Yuanyuan was certain that old master Bai had secretly given her something good. At this moment, no matter how much she explained, it would be in vain. ”

As long as she knew it clearly in her heart.

“”I feel that grandfather has always been very fair. If you insist on thinking that grandfather is unfair, then there’s nothing I can do about it.”Bai Jingshu continued, “Yuanyuan, grandfather is already old. He has no obligation to treat us well and give us gifts. “Now is the time for us to show our respect to him!” ”

“Bai Yuanyuan smiled and said, “Sister Jingshu, am I not standing up for you? Why are you blaming me!” ”

“”As long as you know what’s going on.”Bai Jingshu continued, “I have other matters to attend to. I have to make a trip to Qizhou Road. I’ll be leaving First!” ”

“Looking at Bai Jingshu’s back, Bai Yuanyuan snorted. “What’s so great about it! Grandfather likes you so much, but aren’t you still a useless vase?” ”

She even threw her a look.

It was simply disgusting.

Bai Mo walked over and looked at Bai Yuanyuan. “How is it? What did Bai Jingshu Say? What did grandfather give her?”

“Bai Yuanyuan turned to look at Bai Mo., she said somewhat speechlessly, “Bai Jingshu is treating me like a fool! She said that grandfather only gave her a marriage talisman. Do you believe that? “If grandfather really only gave her a marriage charm, I’ll cut off my head and let her kick it like a rubber ball!” ”

Bai Mo sneered. “I didn’t expect Bai Jingshu to be so good at pretending.”

“”Exactly,”Bai Yuanyuan continued, “Otherwise, how could she attract so many men to like her!” ”

Bai Mo nodded. “What you said makes a lot of sense!”

“After saying that, Bai Mo continued, “Think of a way to ask du yaosheng out tomorrow. Tell him that we have a way to help him get Bai Jingshu.” ”

“”Do we really want to take advantage of Du Yaosheng to Bai Jingshu?”Du Yaosheng was, after all, the bachelor that everyone wanted to marry. Bai Yuanyuan had secretly adored him before. Now, she suddenly pushed du Yaosheng to Bai Jingshu’s side, bai Yuanyuan was quite unwilling. ”

Why did she have to let Bai Jingshu take advantage of all good things?

How could she be worse than Bai Jingshu?

“Bai Mo knew what Bai Yuanyuan was thinking and smiled. “Don’t worry, I’ll find someone better in the future.” ”

“”Really?”Hearing this, Bai Yuanyuan’s eyes instantly lit up. ”

“”Of course it’s true,”Bai mo continued, “Who cares about du Yaosheng? Once my matter with Manwen is settled, I’ll set you up with the head of the Feng family. I heard that Manwen and the head of the Feng family have a very good relationship.” ”

“Hearing this, Bai Yuanyuan’s entire person became spirited. ”

She did not expect that Bai Mo would treat her so well!

He had even thought of a home for her.

The Feng family head!

Then wouldn’t she be the Feng family head’s mistress in the future?

“Bai Yuanyuan almost floated up, her heart bursting with joy. ”

“”Mo Mo, thank you.”Bai Yuanyuan hugged Bai Mo excitedly. “You are practically my best sister.” ”

“Bai Mo smiled and said, “We are best sisters to begin with. I’m already eating meat, so naturally, I won’t ask you to drink soup.” ”

“”Momo, don’t worry. In the future, as long as you need my help, I’ll definitely go through fire and water,”Bai Yuanyuan said. ”

“Okay.”Bai Mo nodded.

...

On the other side.

Bai Jingshu returned home.

“Bai Ying’s mother, Zhou Ying, came up to her. “Why are you only back now? Your father and I have been back for quite a while!” ”
