Translator: 549690339

“Polly said, “Give me some time, it shouldn’t be a problem.” ”

“”That’s good.”Adar nodded. “Polly, we f nation’s face will be in your hands! You must not let that Chinese see a joke.” ”

“Polly smiled and said, “Don’t worry, I definitely won’t let you down.” ”

Polly was very confident in himself.

“This was because everyone had a weakness, and everything had a loophole. ”

“If he could even break through L’s firewall, it meant that he had found L’s weakness. ”

“This time, he would definitely be able to defeat L. ”

Polly sat in front of the main computer and began to counterattack.

“On this side, when L saw that the other party had come online, he narrowed his eyes. ”

It was finally here!

“Polly originally wanted to directly stop L and make a deduction to hack the computer on the other side, but unexpectedly, L didn’t give him the chance at all. ”

“In just a few minutes, Polly was trapped there and couldn’t even move his mouse. ”

What was going on?

Polly was sweating profusely.

On the other side.

L looked at the other party’s operation and lit a cigarette.

It was obvious that the person on the other side was not the same person who broke through his firewall within ten minutes.

L did not have time to play with such a person. He pressed the Enter Key.

The computer screen was immediately occupied by a piece of English code.

On the other side.

Polly kept changing the code.

The next second.

PA —

“A white light flashed on the computer screen, and all the computers returned to normal operation in that instant. ”

Polly was stunned.

This...

This was it?

He didn’t do anything!

It seemed that the legendary L was just so-so.

“Just as Polly heaved a sigh of relief, there was another ‘Pa’. The computer that had returned to normal quickly dimmed at this moment. ”

A green ‘l’slowly appeared on the black screen.

The virus had not been removed.

“Polly narrowed his eyes and immediately picked up the mouse, preparing to turn the tide. ”

“The computer had just returned to normal, and now it had suddenly become like this. It must be that L was unwilling to admit defeat and had redone it. ”

“However, Polly was not anxious at all. ”

“After all, he had already found L’s weakness. ”

“As long as he followed the operation just now and did it again, he would definitely be able to successfully defeat L. ”

“The cubicles, however, exploded at this time. ”

“”Not good, not good! There’s a problem with the computer on the second floor!” ”

“What should we do? Where’s Miss Ye! Didn’t miss ye restore the surveillance? Why Can’t she defeat L. ?”

“Someone lowered his voice and said, “Lower Your Voice. I heard that the person who restored the surveillance wasn’t Miss Ye, it was Mr. Polly. Isn’t Mr. Polly fighting with L. On the Main Computer?” ”

“Mr. Polly? It’s clearly Miss Ye!”

“I heard that it was Miss Ye who picked up Mr. Polly’s loophole!”

“How could this be?”

“”If the person who restored the surveillance was really Mr. Polly, then why can’t he defeat L Now? It’s clearly Polly who can’t afford to lose!” ”

“Lower Your Voice! Don’t let him hear you!”

“Who said Mr. Polly would lose! It’s only just begun! What’s the rush? I believe in Mr. Polly!”

“For a moment, the cubicle was filled with discussions. ”

“The deputy executive wiped his sweat as he walked up to Polly. “Mr. Polly, what did you do just now? Why did the computer on the second floor go down as well?” ”

“What?”Polly thought he was hearing things. “The computer on the second and second floor went down as well?”

Only then did Polly realize that he had not defeated L.

L. had temporarily retrieved the virus so that the computers on the second floor would also be affected.

“Thinking of this, Polly’s face turned pale. ”

“The deputy executive nodded. “That’s right! Mr. Polly, what on Earth have you done? What should we do now? If the headquarters blames you, who will bear the blame!” ”

Adar ran over from the side. “Mr. Deputy Executive! Please don’t stand here and disturb Polly. I guarantee that Polly will definitely be able to defeat L. in the shortest time possible!”

“The deputy executive looked up at Adar. “Do you know that the computers on the second floor are all down! What did your subordinate Polly Do! If this goes on, our entire branch will be controlled by someone!” ”

“If Adar had not forcefully blamed Polly for the restoration of the surveillance cameras, things would not have turned out this way. ”

“When they heard this, Adar and Polly had the same expression. They turned to look at Polly. “What’s going on?” ”

“At this moment, Polly was really panicking. “I, I don’t know what’s going on either...” ”

Not only was he panicking.

He was also regretting it.

He should not have said that ye Zao had picked up a loophole at this moment.

“In such a situation, ye Zao should have embarrassed himself. ”

“Ye Zao could not even fix the surveillance cameras, let alone go against L! ”

But now.

He was the one who had embarrassed himself.

No.

He could not be defeated just like that.

He could not lose!

“With his understanding of computers, how could he lose to a Chinese person? ”

“Polly tried his best to calm himself down, then he said, “Mr. Adar, don’t worry. No matter what, I will do my best to fight with L to the end. Restoring surveillance and controlling the virus are different. Please give me some time, Mr. Deputy Executive Officer!” ”

“Adar nodded and turned to look at the deputy executive officer, “Being anxious now is not a solution! “If even Polly can’t contend with L, do you think a little girl from China can? “If things really reach a point of no return, I’ll explain it to the headquarters!” ”

The deputy executive officer took a deep breath. He was too lazy to argue with Yardar and went upstairs to look for Smith.

On the other side.

Ranito casino.

Yardar came to Carl’s room personally.

“Hearing the footsteps, Carl said directly, “How many times do you want me to repeat it? I’m really not familiar with An.” ”

“A moment later, Alar appeared in the room with a faint smile on his face, “Mr. Carl, you should know that there is a limit to a person’s patience.” ”

“Carl looked up impatiently, “How many times do you want me to say it? I’m not familiar with An! No matter how much you force me, I can’t find An!” ”

“”Really?”Yaler curled his lips and leaned over to sit in front of Carl, “I originally wanted to explore with Mr. Carl, but judging from Mr. Carl’s appearance, he doesn’t want to talk to me! In that case, don’t blame me for being rude to you!” ”

“At the end of his sentence, Yaler took out a gun from his waist, put it to his mouth and blew on it. Then, the cold muzzle of the gun was pressed against Carl’s forehead. ”

Click.

It was the sound of the trigger being pulled.

“”Mr. Carl, don’t think that I’m playing with you.”Although there was still a smile on his face, his eyes were completely cold. “If you push me too far, I’ll do anything!” ”

The reason why he was able to get to this point was because of his dirty hands.

He wanted to discuss it with Carl and take Carl for his own use.

“But Carl didn’t cooperate, so he had to resort to this. ”

“Carl gulped, “Mr. Arles, please calm down...” ”

“Carl said as he carefully pushed the muzzle away, “Mr. Arles, guns are too dangerous. Be careful not to let the gun go off.” ”

“The next second, the muzzle was pushed away and pressed against Carl’s forehead again. Arles’cold voice sounded in the air, “I’ll count to three. It’s your choice whether you live or Die.” ”

“Then, he started counting, “Three, two...” ”

Carl was so scared that his face turned pale.

“Just as he was about to count down to one, a cold light quickly flew over from the direction of the door. ”

Shoo!

It was covered with a chill.

Bang!

The shadow directly hit the gun in his hand.

Crack!

“At the same time, the light directly nailed into the wall. ”

Yeller turned his head and saw that what was stuck on the wall was a card! ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com
