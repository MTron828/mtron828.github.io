“Nowadays, how could anyone go out without a cell phone? ”

It was clearly ye Zhuo who did not want to add song Chenyu.

Did Ye Zhuo really think that she could ignore everything just because she stood in front of Cen Shaoqing?

She was just a small Internet celebrity. What right did she have to reject song Chenyu?

It was also because song Chenyu had a good temper and did not want to argue with her.

Everyone returned to their seats.

Ye Zhuo looked at Cen Shaoqing. “Let me use your phone.”

“Since she had already said that she did not bring her phone, she naturally could not take it out again. ”

Cen Shaoqing extended his hand to his assistant beside him. “Phone.”

“Under everyone’s watchful eyes, his assistant took out a pink phone. ”

Pink?

Cen Shaoqing’s phone was actually pink!

Everyone could not help but be stunned.

“Song Chenyu tilted his head and looked at Cen Yuyan. “Yuyan, that’s Master Five’s phone.” ”

“Although she did not want to admit it, Cen Yuyan still nodded. “I wonder what kind of bewitching drug ye Zhuo fed my fifth brother to coax him into being obedient to her!” ”

“At this point, Cen Yuyan seemed to have realized something, she continued, “But Chenyu, don’t worry too much. With my fifth brother’s character, he would not easily fall in love with anyone. He probably did this to show it to my grandmother. You also know that my grandmother is old and probably won’t have many years left. My fifth brother is also a filial son. He probably doesn’t want my grandmother to leave with regrets.” ”

Falling for ye Zao?

Was Cen Shaoqing’s eyesight that bad?

“Song Chenyu nodded and continued, “Right, can you let me see your wechat?” ”

“Sure.”Cen Yuyan took out her phone and unlocked it before handing it to Song Chenyu.

Song Chenyu opened Cen Yuyan’s wechat.

“Cen Yuyan’s contact list was filled with many people, but Song Chenyu did not manage to find ye Zao. “Yuyan, what did you add to Miss Ye?” ”

“I didn’t add her as a friend.”

“Cen Yuyan had never taken ye Zao seriously, so she naturally would not take the initiative to add ye Zao. ”

“Ye Zao was not the type of person who liked to please others, so the two of them still did not have each other’s wechat. ”

“”Chenyu, do you want to see her Wechat?” ”

Song Chenyu did not deny it. “I want to see her circle of friends.”

She wanted to know more about what kind of person ye Zao was!

Knowing Yourself and your enemy would win every battle.

“If she had known that ye Zao knew how to race, she definitely would not have agreed to race with ye Zao today. ”

The reason why she agreed.

“Was because she thought that with her ability, she would definitely win against ye Zao. ”

She did not expect...

“Cen Yuyan continued, “She seems to be in that group of people who love each other.” ”

Love each other?

Song Chenyu was slightly stunned. She did not expect ye Zhuo to infiltrate the Cen family so quickly.

It seemed.

Old Madam Cen really liked ye Zhuo very much!

Ye Zhuo looked young.

“In reality, he was a very scheming person. ”

“Under his beautiful skin, there was an ugly heart. ”

Cen Yuyan opened the group chat.

There were two groups in the CEN family.

“One was a group of people who loved each other. There were only seven members of the CEN family, and then there were eight people in total with Ye Zhuo. ”

“The other was a large group. There were a few daughters and sons-in-law of the Cen family, as well as a few grandsons and granddaughters. ”

There were a total of eight people in the group of loving families.

Song Chenyu opened ye Zao’s wechat.

The wechat name was an unknown little flower.

Nickname: This Peace of Mind is my hometown.

Was he pretending to be deep?

He opened his wechat moments.

The other party showed that he was not a friend and did not show it.

Song Chenyu handed the phone to Cen Yuyan. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Cen Yuyan asked curiously, “Chenyu, did you see it?” ”

Song Chenyu shook his head. “No.”

“Why didn’t I see it?”Cen Yuyan asked in puzzlement.

“Song Chenyu said, “She set it to not show if she was not a friend.” ”

Not Show if she was not a friend?

Cen Yuyan frowned. “I’ll add her as a friend.”

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “I won’t trouble you, Yuyan.” ”

“What’s so troublesome about that!”Cen Yuyan clicked to add ye Zhuo as a friend.

She was Cen Shaoqing’s fourth sister.

How could ye Zhuo not add her as a friend?

“Thank you.”

“Cen Yuyan smiled and said, “Who’s with whom!” ”

“After watching the car race, he ziteng suggested going to the club next door to have some fun. ”

Cen Shaoqing lowered his eyes and asked for Ye Zhuo’s opinion.

“He ziteng said, “God, the desserts in that club are delicious! You definitely haven’t eaten them before!” ”

“Let’s go.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Okay.”

The group of people set off for the club again.

This was a membership club.

“There were all sorts of things to eat, drink, and have fun. ”

A few men went to play billiards.

“Ye Zhuo curled up on the sofa and ate the desserts. Cen Shaoqing sat next to her and stretched out his hand to wrap it around her waist, bringing her to his lap. His other hand also circled around her waist, his hot palm pressing tightly against hers ”
