Yin Wei focused her eyes and took a look. “Eh? I clearly saw it just now!”

“”You’re seeing things,”ye Zao said with a smile.”

“Yin Wei used her hands to dig again. After confirming that there were no leeches, she was finally relieved.”

“Everyone went out to work. In the blink of an eye, only song Shiyu was left in the small courtyard.”

“Song Shiyu wanted to go back to his room to rest, but he heard ye Zhuo’s voice, so he pushed the door open and walked out.”

“Walking along the small path, it didn’t take long for him to see an open field.”

“It was the time when the farmers were busy, and there were busy figures in almost every paddy field.”

There were unknown little flowers blooming on the edge of the field.

“Gusts of breeze blew over, sweeping up the faint fragrance of the flowers, making people feel relaxed and happy.”

“Although the scenery in the fields was beautiful, song Shiyu was not in the mood to appreciate it. Just as he was about to go back, his gaze swept past not far away.”

A slender figure came into view.

“The girl’s facial features were as clear as jade, and her temperament was as elegant as an orchid. However, there was also a bit of unruly unruliness about her.”

Extremely Beautiful.

And also extremely unruly.

Song Shiyu subconsciously stopped his footsteps.

He looked in that direction.

“By the time song Shiyu returned to the small courtyard, it was already evening.”

The golden sunlight cast a faint layer of light over the small courtyard.

“Seeing that song Shiyu had returned, Song Chenyu immediately went up to him and said with a smile, “Third brother, why don’t you not go back tonight? There happens to be an empty room here!””

“Okay.”Song Shiyu nodded.

“Really?”Song Chenyu was a little surprised.

“She had only asked Song Shiyu to give it a try, but she did not expect song Shiyu to actually agree.”

This made song Chenyu a little flattered.

“Really.”

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “Then I’ll go clean up your room now.””

The next morning.

Ye Zhuo got up at 5:30 am on time to run.

“He had just run two laps when he ran into song Shiyu, who had gotten up early for morning exercises.”

“Ye Zao.”

“”Brother Song.”Seeing song Shiyu, ye Zao subconsciously slowed down his footsteps. His gaze fell on song Shiyu’s face, and he asked curiously, “Didn’t you apply the ointment I gave you?””

“”I did. According to what you said, once every two hours.”He did apply it, and it was very punctual.”

“It was just that after applying it, he wiped it off with a tissue.”

Ye Zhuo frowned slightly.

“She had personally concocted that ointment. It was very effective in promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis. Under normal circumstances, after eight hours, all the bruises on her face would disappear.”

“However, the bruises on song Shiyu’s face were still the same.”

“After saying that, song Shiyu continued, “My constitution is special. Perhaps that ointment has no effect on me.””

“Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “How about this? When we get back, I’ll give you another ointment to try.””

“Then I’ll have to trouble you.”

“Of course.”

“After running, Ye Zhuo brought another bottle of ointment for song Shiyu. Then, Ye Zhuo began to prepare breakfast.”

...

On the other side.

Beijing.

Today was Saturday. It was also the day that Cen Yuyan and Zhou Rui went home to meet their parents.

“At 6:30 in the morning, Cen Yuyan got up and sat in front of the dressing table to freshen up.”

“In order to meet the Zhou family’s parents, Cen Yuyan specially asked the makeup artist to design a make-up for her that looked very young and youthful.”

“The effect was very good, but the make-up time was a little long.”

“As the makeup artist put on Cen Yuyan’s make-up, she sighed and said, “Miss Cen, Your Foundation is really good. I need at least two hours to put on this kind of make-up for others. With You, one hour is more than enough.””

“Cen Yuyan smiled and said, “Is that so?””

“”Of course,”the makeup artist continued, “But it’s also possible that they’re too old. Miss Cen, I don’t think you’re more than 25 years old, right? This youth is really good. Your face is full of collagen.””

How could the makeup artist not know Cen Yuyan’s true age?

She was just speaking human language to others and nonsense to ghosts.

Reality proved that these words were very applicable to CEN Yuyan. How could Cen Yuyan not be happy that a 39-year-old who was approaching 40 years old was said to be less than 25 years old? 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Cen Yuyan smiled and said, “That’s not true. I’m already over 30 years old this year.””

“”Already 30 years old?”The makeup artist had dealt with this group of socialites all year round and his acting skills had long been perfected, he said incredulously, “Oh my God! I couldn’t tell that you were already 30 years old! I thought you were at most 22 or 23 years old!””

“”Not 30, but 39,”Cen Yuyan continued.”

“Oh my God! 39!”The makeup artist was even more surprised.

Cen Yuyan nodded.

“An hour later, the makeup artist applied a layer of make-up spray on Cen Yuyan’s face and said with a smile, “See if there’s anything you’re not satisfied with.””
