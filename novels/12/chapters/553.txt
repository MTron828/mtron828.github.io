Zhao Shuqi was truly panicking. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“He was panicking, panicking.”

He wished he could crawl out of his phone and strangle Zhao shuning to death.

“If it wasn’t for Zhao shuning, he wouldn’t have become like this.”

S 3!

Ye Zhuo was actually s 3.

He never dreamed that ye Zhuo was actually s 3.

S 3 was a special group of people that ordinary people couldn’t afford to offend!

Who would have known that the daughter Lin Jincheng had just recognized had an unceasing relationship with s3?

“Thinking of Sun Peiyuan’s call to him just now, Zhao Shuqi was filled with regret.”

“But at that time, Zhao Shuqi was busy with other things and did not listen at all.”

It was his fault.

It was all his fault.

“If he had listened to Sun Peiyuan’s words at that time, this kind of thing would not have happened now.”

Changing the name of S3.

Wasn’t this equivalent to touching the soil on the head of the Lord?

“Thinking of the experience just now, cold sweat broke out on Zhao Shuqi’s forehead, and his legs went soft.”

“When Zhao shuning received Zhao Shuqi’s call, he was also stunned.”

He even thought that he had heard wrongly.

Could it be that ye Zhuo was some important person?

“Otherwise, why would zhao Shuqi be so anxious and angry?”

“Zhao shuning frowned. “Brother, what are you saying? Why Can’t I Understand?””

“The name had already been changed. If she changed it back now, where would she and Old Lady Lin put their faces?”

“Zhao shuqi almost roared out, “Zhao shuning! Are You Deaf? I told you to change Miss Ye’s name back! Now, immediately! Do you know that I’m going to be screwed by you this time!””

Zhao shuning trembled from the shouting and tried to calm himself down. “What’s wrong with brother?”

“Zhao Shuqi was almost angered to death by Zhao shuning. “Zhao shuning! Don’t you understand human language? I told you to change Miss Ye’s name back right now, or else I’m not going to let you off!””

“Just as he said this, Zhao Shuqi slammed the phone down. Due to his blood pressure skyrocketing, Zhao Shuqi’s entire face was red and his temples were throbbing! He almost fainted from anger!”

Never in his wildest dreams did he expect that his own sister would make him suffer so miserably!

“Originally, he was Sun Peiyuan’s immediate superior. After this incident, he would not even have a chance to meet Sun Peiyuan in the future.”

Zhao Shuqi was so angry that he waved the furniture on the office desk away.

“On the other side, before Zhao shuning could react, father Zhao’s phone call came in again.”

Father Zhao did not say a word. He immediately scolded Zhao Shuning and even threatened to sever the relationship between father and daughter.

“Only then did Zhao shuning realize the seriousness of the matter. His back was covered with layers of cold sweat. He quickly hung up the phone and walked to Old Lady Lin’s side. “Mom, something bad has happened...””

“Old Lady Lin was teaching Lin Jincheng a lesson. When she heard this, she turned to look at Zhao shuning. “What’s Wrong?””

Zhao shuning’s expression was very ugly. He lowered his head and whispered a few words to Old Lady Lin.

“When she heard this, Old Lady Lin’s expression changed. She suppressed the anger in her eyes and looked up at Lin Jincheng.”

“Jincheng! Did you do something to this?”

Lin Jincheng was baffled by the question. “What is it?”

“Old Lady Lin slammed the table, she said angrily, “It’s about changing my granddaughter’s name! As a grandmother, can’t I change my granddaughter’s name? Hurry up and call those people and tell them not to cause trouble for Brother Shuning!””

“Other than Lin Jincheng, no one else could implicate Zhao Shuqi in this matter.”

Lin Jincheng had managed the LIN Group for so many years and had developed many forces.

Old Lady Lin didn’t think that a little girl like ye Zhuo could have much ability!

Could Ye Zhuo threaten the deep-rooted Zhao family?

“Obviously, it was impossible!”

“”So Zhao Shuqi was involved in this matter!”Lin Jincheng looked at Zhao shuning. “Fourth sister-in-law, this was your idea, right?””

“Zhao shuning also felt that Lin Jincheng had something to do with this matter. “Jincheng, Zhuozhuo is Mom’s granddaughter. What’s wrong with letting her take mom’s surname? My brother was just entrusted by someone to be loyal!””

This matter had nothing to do with Zhao Shuqi. Why should Lin Jincheng vent his anger on Zhao Shuqi?

“Ye Zhuo slowly stood up from his chair. “Fourth aunt, if you have time to talk nonsense here, why don’t you bring Grandma to the police station earlier to change my name back? If you go too late, you won’t be able to protect the Zhao family.””

His last sentence was rather threatening.

Zhao shuning’s face turned pale. “Don’t you dare!”

“Ye Zhuo gently raised his eyes, which were overflowing with light. “You’ll know if you dare or not if you try. But let me remind you, there are all kinds of medicine in this world, but there is no medicine for regret.””
