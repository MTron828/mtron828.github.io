“Li Erzhu said, “You’re finally here! Mom has been waiting for you for hours!” ”

“”I was busy with something just now,”said Li Sanzhu. ”

“Come with me quickly.”

Li Erzhu followed Li Sanzhu’s footsteps.

The two of them came to the study.

Old Lady Li was sitting on a chair in front of the desk.

“”Mom, Sanzhu is here,”said Li Erzhu. ”

“Hearing Li Erzhu’s voice, old lady li raised her eyelids. “Sit there.” ”

Li Sanzhu sat opposite Old Lady Li.

“Li Erzhu said, “Mom, I’ll go out first.” ”

“Go.”Old Lady Li nodded.

“But in the blink of an eye, only Old Lady Li and Li Sanzhu were left in the study room. ”

The air was a little quiet.

“Li Sanzhu gulped and then said, “Mom, why did you call me here this time?” ”

“What is it? Don’t you know in Your Heart?”Old Mrs. Li asked back.

Li Sanzhu didn’t say anything.

“Old Mrs. Li continued, “Sanzhu, you have been obedient and filial since you were young. I remember one winter when I said I wanted to eat fish, you didn’t say anything and went to the river to fish. When you came back, you were half frozen to death, but I don’t know when you changed! Ask yourself, do you still have me as your mother in Your Eyes Now?” ”

“Hearing these words, Li Sanzhu felt a little uncomfortable in his heart. ”

“At that time, Old Mrs. Li was still a good mother. ”

“At some point, the old lady had changed. ”

She had become so unfamiliar.

“Li Sanzhu said, “Mom, you’ve always been my mother. Don’t worry. No matter what, I’ll return to your retirement!” ”

“Is that what I want?”Old Mrs. Li asked.

“Li Sanzhu looked at Old Mrs. Li and said, “Mom, if you want to talk about Shuyi, then let me tell you, this is impossible!” ” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Li Shuyi’s matter was already set in stone!

The person she offended was fifth master cen.

“Not to mention that he wouldn’t say anything, even if he did say something, fifth master Cen wouldn’t let Li Shuyi off. ”

“”Why not? Why Not?”Old Lady Li glared at Li Sanzhu. “Shuyi is your niece, and the only daughter of your brother and sister-in-law! Can you bear to see your brother and sister-in-law sad at home?” ”

“Li Sanzhu sighed. “Mom, how many times do you want me to tell you? I really can’t do anything about this!” ”

“”It was Fang yinyue’s idea, right?”Old Lady Li asked. ”

“”What does this have to do with yinyue?”Li Sanzhu was a little speechless. “Could it be that yinyue pressed Shuyi’s head and asked her to go to Fifth Master Cen’s room? “Mom, have you ever thought about how this matter would end up like what Shuyi thought? “Miss Ye is Yueyue’s classmate, and Shuyi is Yueyue’s cousin. When that time comes, how will yueyue explain to Miss Ye?” ”

Li Sanzhu was very glad that Li Shuyi did not succeed at that time.

“If Li Shuyi succeeded, then Li Yueyue really would not have the face to see ye Zao! ”

“Old Madam Li snorted coldly. “Now I can see that you no longer have me as your mother in your eyes! Even if Fang yinyue did not press Shuyi’s head to do this, it has something to do with Fang yinyue!” ”

“At this point, old lady li continued, “Don’t think that I don’t know what Fang yinyue is thinking. Isn’t she just trying to get her daughter to take over? My poor Shuyi has become someone else’s stepping stone just like that!” ”

What did Old Lady Li Mean by this?

Li Sanzhu was so angry that his face alternated between red and white.

He couldn’t understand why old Lady Li would be so biased toward her granddaughter!

“For Li Shuyi, she even insulted Li Yueyue. ”

This was too much!

“”Mom, what are you talking about? Let me tell you, our Yueyue has never had such dirty thoughts!” ”

Dirty?

Who Was Li Sanzhu calling dirty?

Li Shuyi?

PA!

Old Lady Li raised her hand and slammed it on the table.

“”Shut up! I’m still here, and you dare to Bully Shuyi. If I leave, your family of four will shit on Shuyi’s head, won’t They?” ”

“Old Lady Li usually treated Li Shuyi like her eyeballs were hurting. In addition, Li Shuyi was raised by her. How could she tolerate Li Sanzhu insulting Li Shuyi like this? ”

“Li Sanzhu looked at Old Lady Li with a mocking look in his eyes. “Mom, who is bullying who now?” ”

“Looking at her son who was going against her, Old Lady Li only felt that her life was too bitter! ”
