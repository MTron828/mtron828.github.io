“Ye Han, Leo, the evil doctor, and the members of the JY team. Which one of them wasn’t someone who could make the s galaxy tremble three times with a simple stomp of their feet? ”

“Perhaps, other than these people, there would be others who would come over to support her and support her. After all, her popularity wasn’t just for show. ”

How could an ordinary person form a relationship with Leo?

“The more Duanmu Feng thought about it, the more excited she became. Her heart was beating faster and faster, and her ears were filled with envious voices. ”

“”Miss Duanmu, you’re really amazing! Other than some of the more important international conferences, I’ve never seen Chief Ye, Leo, the evil doctor, and the JY team appear together!” ”

“”Yes, yes! I’ve never seen them either!” ”

“”Did you guys see Chief Ye just now? He’s so handsome! If I can marry such a person, I’ll do anything!” ”

“”Fengyou, I’m really envious of you! You actually let so many big shots come to support you! I heard that Leo and the others can’t even fit in the space compressor that they prepared!” ”

“Ever since Duanmu Huang flew in, the Duanmu family’s position in the main alliance was no longer the same as before. For Duanmu Fengyou to be able to let so many people attend the family recognition banquet at such a time was enough to prove Duanmu Fengyou’s status in the S Galaxy. ”

“It was also because Duanmu Feng and her family were lucky enough to be born to be the fiancée of the young master of Dongli. After the Duanmu family lost power, she was still able to use her own strength to take root in the s galaxy. ”

“With so many bigwigs standing behind Duanmu Feng and supporting her, even if Cen Haifeng intended to side with Ye Zao Tonight, he probably wouldn’t be able to! ”

One had to admit that Duanmu Feng and her family were really amazing!

“Hearing this, Duanmu Fengyu turned her head slightly and said with some embarrassment, “Yucheng, don’t say that. Tonight, Miss Ye is the main character, and I’m just a supporting character. Maybe they’re all here for Miss Ye.” ”

“She was taking a step back to advance, dragging ye Zao into a dilemma so that everyone could make fun of ye Zao without restraint. ”

For Ye Zao?

Wasn’t this a joke?

“Ye Han, Leo, and the JY team wished they could just kill ye Zao. ”

They would come for ye Zao?

Liang Yucheng smiled and looked at Duanmu Fengyu. “Miss Ye? which miss ye are you talking about?”

“”Yucheng, look at what you’re saying. Is there a second miss ye here tonight?”Duanmu Fengyu asked back. ”

“Liang Yucheng continued, “She’s just a fake! What kind of Miss Ye is she? How could she be worthy of Chief Ye and Clan Leader Lei’s personal congratulations? In your dreams!” ”

None of the socialites attending the banquet were convinced by Ye Zao.

What was ye Zao?

He was just a low-level earthling.

How could she become the most Honorable First Lady of the General Alliance without doing anything?

Duanmu Feng was different!Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The Duanmu family was an aristocrat of the Alliance!

“Furthermore, she was a low-level earthling. How could she let these big shots come for her? ”

It was simply wishful thinking!

“Other than Duanmu Feng, who else could have such charisma? ”

“If one thought about it with their toes, they should know that they were here for Duanmu Feng. ”

“Hearing this, Duanmu Feng’s smile became even more pronounced. ”

Liang Yucheng finally spoke her mind.

What right did ye Zhuo have?

She was just a clown.

“As soon as Liang Yucheng finished speaking, someone at the side immediately said in a strange tone, “Yucheng, don’t underestimate her. Indeed, more than half of the people tonight are here for Miss Ye!” ”

“Ye Han, Leo, the evil doctor, the JY team, and the others were all ye Zao’s supporters. ”

“Now that someone was fooling around with ye Zao’s face, they definitely had to clean up ye Zao’s House! ”

It was obvious that ye Zao would die a horrible death tonight.

“Not only did he look like ye Zao, he even dared to use ye Zao’s name! ”

Liang Yucheng’s eyes were filled with sarcasm. “You’re right. Some people are about to reveal their true colors!”

“Speaking up to this point, Liang Yucheng changed the topic and sighed. “It’s a pity that miss ye can’t be there personally. If miss ye could come, it would be even more exciting!” ”

Fake versus real. Let’s see how that fake can get off the stage!

She was afraid that she would have to find a hole to hide in on the spot.

“Su Mu said, “This matter is so big that it might have already spread to miss ye’s ears! The banquet hasn’t started yet. How do you know that Miss Ye isn’t coming?” ”

“”So, Miss Ye is coming back?”Liang Yucheng asked. ”

“”If you ask me, Miss Ye might come, or she might not come!” ”
