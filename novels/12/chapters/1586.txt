Translator: 549690339

When did ye Zao learn French?

Ye Zao couldn’t even recognize Chinese characters.

Ye Zao continued to explain f to Zhao duoduo.

“Her tone was clear, and her pronunciation was pure. Zhao duoduo’s face was filled with admiration. ”

“Not only Zhao duoduo, but everyone else in the room was shocked. ”

Language was an art.

“Although they did not know much about French, listening to ye Zhuo’s pronunciation was also an auditory enjoyment. ”

It was not an exaggeration to say that it was an auditory feast!

“Ten minutes later, Ye Zhuo explained all the problems that Zhao duoduo had encountered clearly. ”

“Zhao duoduo said excitedly, “Cousin-in-law! You are really amazing. Even our F language teacher’s words are not as good as yours!” ”

“Ye Zao’s tone was clear and shallow. “When you’ve learned it, it’ll definitely be better than what I said.” ”

“Zhao duoduo smiled and said, “I don’t expect it to be good. As long as I can pass the test, it’ll be fine. Oh right, cousin-in-law, let’s add each other on wechat. If I run into any problems, I’ll ask you on wechat.” ”

“Sure.”Ye Zao took out his phone.

“Yuan Fei walked over. “Cousin-in-law, I want to add you on wechat too.” ”

The three of them exchanged wechat messages.

“Look at what you’ve Done!”Zeng Qiuwen glared at Zeng Rou.

“At first, Zhao duoduo had been polite to her in the Zhao family. After all, she was the only one who had studied in country F in the Zhao family! ”

But now.

“Zeng Rou pushed ye Zhuo out. Ye Zhuo spoke French so well. With Zhu Yu in front of her, what could she be in Zhao duoduo’s eyes in the future? This cousin of hers was simply a failure! ”

Zeng Rou was also very upset. How could she have known that ye Zao could speak f language so well!

“If she had known earlier, she definitely would not have raised a stone to hit her own feet. ”

It was too late to regret now.

“Zeng Rou took a deep breath and continued, “Sister, don’t be anxious. I always have a way to make her give herself away!” ”

Ye Zao had a bad record. How could he have changed so much in such a short time?

“Even if she said it in French, she would definitely have other shortcomings. ”

“”Save it.”Zeng Qiuwen turned to look at Zeng Rou and suppressed the anger in her eyes. “Don’t embarrass yourself! This is the Zhao family, not some small family! It can make you lose face!” ”

“The more Zeng Qiuwen said this, the more uncomfortable Zeng Rou felt. ”

She couldn’t let ye Zao take away all the glory.

Standing beside ye Zao was Cen Wuye.

Who Was Cen Wuye?

Cen Wuye was someone she didn’t dare to dream of.

What did ye Zao have?

Just thinking about it made Zeng Rou’s heart ache. She felt very uncomfortable.

“Even if she knew that Cen Shaoqing was playing with Ye Zao, she couldn’t do it. ”

“Moreover, from Cen Shaoqing’s appearance, he seemed to be in love. ”

Just ye Zao?

What did ye Zao have?

“He had no family background, no background, and was an illegitimate daughter. ”

“Although she didn’t look like ye Zao, she was born better than ye Zao. ”

How could ye Zao Take All the Good Things?

“If it was the same as before, it would be fine if ye Zao was an idiot. ”

“But now, ye Zao did not seem to be an idiot anymore! ”

No.

She had to make ye Zao lose face in public.

“Otherwise, she really could not take this lying down. ”

Zeng rou pinched her fingers.

“Zeng Qiuwen, who was standing at the side, saw Zeng Rou’s expression. ”

“Zeng Qiuwen narrowed her eyes and continued, “I’m warning you, don’t shoot yourself in the foot!”Zeng Qiuwen was a very calm and smart person. Otherwise, she would not have been able to successfully get pregnant with Zhao Jiadong’s child and rise to the top, zeng Rou was still too young! She couldn’t keep her cool! ”

She didn’t even think about it. Since this ye Zao could make Cen Wuye

Zeng Rou curled her lips. “I got it.”

“After saying that, Zeng rou continued, “SIS, do you know where this ye Zao came from?” ”

“What do you mean?”Zeng Qiuwen asked.

“Zeng Rou looked at ye Zao who was sitting beside Cen Shaoqing, she lowered her voice and said, “Ye Zao used to be the fake daughter of the Mu family. You should know about this, right, soldier Mu?”! After this matter was exposed by the Mu family, Ye Zao went back to her biological mother’s side. Do you know what kind of person her biological mother was? She was a mistress... “... “...” ”

“Zeng Rou originally wanted to make a fuss about the ‘mistress’, but unexpectedly, when Zeng Qiuwen heard this, her expression darkened. ”

“Zeng Rou cursed inwardly and hurriedly said, “Sister, I didn’t mean that! What I meant was that ye Zao was just an illegitimate daughter! Think about it, a person like Cen Wu Ye...” ”

“Zeng Rou hadn’t seen ye Zao for a long time, so she didn’t know that ye Zao was the daughter of the Lin family. ”DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com
