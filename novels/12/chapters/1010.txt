“Aunt Lang cried, “It’s my daughter! She’s My Little Half Moon!” ”

“Hearing that, elder Zhang was stunned. ”

It was little half moon?

How was that possible?

Elder Zhang received the appraisal report from Aunt Lang and was completely dumbfounded.

Established.

Their paternity test was actually established.

“Elder Zhang looked up at Doctor Zhou. “Doctor Zhou, are you sure there’s no problem with this paternity test?” ”

Doctor Zhou nodded. “I’m sure there’s no problem.”

“Elder Zhang continued, “Is it possible that you took the wrong one from someone?” ”

“”No,”doctor Zhou continued, “This is the only report in the appraisal room at the moment.” ”

“This... how is this possible...”elder Zhang took a few steps back in disbelief.

“Aunt Lang raised her head to look at elder Zhang. “Elder Zhang, I know you’re very disappointed now. I’m sorry, but I can’t go back with you.” ”

“At the end of her sentence, Aunt Lang bowed to elder Zhang. ”

“Elder Zhang continued, “Lang Hua, there must be something going on in this matter! Why don’t we go to another hospital to take a look?” ”

“Aunt Lang shook her head. “There’s no need to go. Even if we do another 100 tests, she’s still my daughter.” ”

“If the old aunt Lang still had some doubts, then she would not have any doubts now. ”

This was the second people’s Hospital.

Doctor Zhou and elder Zhang were old acquaintances.

There could not be any problems with the tests here.

“After getting the report, Aunt Lang could not wait to return to the Xi family. ”

“When she returned, Yang Jiao was teaching little half moon how to draw. ”

“Yang Jiao.”

Yang Jiao looked up. “Sister is back.”

“Aunt Lang continued, “Yang Jiao, didn’t you say that you know an old Chinese doctor who is confident in curing little half moon’s hysteria? Let’s Go! Let’s Go Now!” ”

“”Go Now?”Yang Jiao pretended that she didn’t know anything. “Sister, didn’t we agree to go tomorrow?” ”

“”I’ve already settled my matters. If we go earlier, little half moon will be able to return to normal earlier.” ”

Yang Jiao nodded. “That’s true. I’ll call old MU and ask her to come back with us.”

Aunt Lang smiled. “There’s no need to call her. We’ll go alone.”

“”Alright then!”Yang Jiao continued, “Weiyue is upstairs. I’ll call Weiyue too.” ”

“Okay.”Aunt Lang nodded.

“Half an hour later, the four of them got into the car and set off for the Old Chinese medicine clinic. ”

“Although half a month was still very resistant to Aunt Lang, Aunt Lang was no longer as sad as before. ”

The current half a month was just a child.

“After she recovered, she would be more sensible. ”

“An hour later, the car stopped in front of a clinic. ”

“Yang jiao smiled and said, “Sister, this godly doctor’s personality is very strange. You have to bear with him later.” ”

Aunt Lang nodded. “I know.”

“As long as this godly doctor could really cure half a month, she was willing to do anything. ”

“Xi Weiyue helped Aunt Lang out of the car and the few of them walked into the clinic. Just as they reached the door, they were stopped by the Old Chinese doctor’s assistant. “Do you have an appointment?” ”

“Yang Jiao smiled and nodded. “Yes, yes! The appointment is at five o’clock this afternoon.” ”

“The assistant continued, “There’s still half an hour before five o’clock. Please wait outside for a moment.” ”

“Okay.”

“Time passed quickly. Half an hour had passed. The assistant walked in front of them and said, “Miracle Doctor Xu’s office only allows two people to enter. Can you discuss who will bring the patient in?” ”

“Aunt Lang wanted to accompany little half moon in, but little half moon had been resisting her, so Aunt Lang could only say, “Yang Jiao, you can accompany Little Half Moon in. Wei Yue and I will wait outside.” ”

“Yang jiao smiled and said, “Sister, don’t worry. I have a way.” ”

“After saying that, Yang Jiao half squatted in front of little half moon and said gently, “Little Half Moon, let your mother go in with you, okay? If you let her go in with you, I will give you a Lollipop!” ”

“Little Half Moon looked at the lollipop in Yang Jiao’s hand, then turned to look at Aunt Lang, and finally nodded. “Okay.” ”

“Little half moon is so obedient.”Yang Jiao passed the lollipop to Little Half Moon.

“Auntie Lang turned to look at Yang Jiao. “Yang Jiao, thank you.” ”

“”How many times have I told you? You’re welcome. Sister, please bring little half moon in quickly.” ”

Auntie Lang held Little Half Moon’s hand. “Let’s go in quickly.”

Little Half Moon nodded. It was rare that she did not say that Auntie Lang was a bad person anymore.

The two of them came to Miracle Doctor Xu’s office.

“Miracle Doctor Xu was an old man in his sixties or seventies. He did not look very familiar. When he saw Aunt Lang bring Xiao Banyue in, he glanced at them and said, “Sit.” ”
