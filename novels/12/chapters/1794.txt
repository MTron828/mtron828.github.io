Translator: 549690339

Those who cared took the opportunity to add fuel to the fire. “I don’t think they even thought about finding her!”

“”I think so too! Second sister-in-law, think about what a good child she is! It’s a pity, a pity that she’s gone just like that!” ”

“Mother Li could not contain her anger. She found director Zhou’s office and took out her phone to take a video, “Director Zhou, let me ask you, where did Miss Ye Go?”? “My daughter has been missing for so long, and we haven’t seen her at all. Now, she’s Gone!”! “If you don’t give us an explanation today, I’ll find the television station to expose you!” ”

“”Mrs. Li, please calm down.”Director Zhou walked out and said, “We are also very surprised and saddened by the matter of team leader Zhou and assistant Xiao Li. Because of this, Miss Ye hasn’t slept for several nights. Please understand.” ”

“Mother Li directly cursed, “So the one who died was my daughter, not your daughter! “What right do you have to say ‘Be Considerate’in front of me! “Things didn’t happen to you. You simply don’t understand the feelings of fathers like us! “I just want to think about such a precious daughter. If anything happens to her, I’ll die in front of you. I Don’t want to live anymore!” ”

“At the end of her sentence, mother Li sat down on the ground. ”

“Tian Zhifang walked over and helped mother Li Up. “Big sister, don’t be like this. It’s already happened. It’s useless no matter how sad you are...” ”

“The one who died wasn’t your daughter! Of course you’re Not Sad!”Mother Li said angrily.

These people didn’t understand her pain at all. Who Wouldn’t say pretty words?

“Tian Zhifang sighed and continued, “Yu Zifei is my son.” ”

Yu Zifei?

“It was Li Xiang’s superior, Yu Zifei? ”

“Mother Li was stunned for a moment before continuing, “Think about it, she’s my only child!” ”

“Tian Zhifang said, “Zifei is also my only child.” ”

“Mother Li Glanced at Tian Zhifang and continued, “I don’t care! I want my daughter Anyway!” ”

“”Big Sis, everything is fate. It’s not up to anyone at all!”Tian Zhifang wiped away her tears and continued, “Miss Ye has already tried her best. As family members, we should just do our best and leave everything to fate.” ”

“As a mother, how could she watch her son die? Even if there was a glimmer of hope, she would not give up. ”

“But now, what could she do if she did not give up? ”

“”If you want to listen to the will of Heaven, you should listen. Don’t drag me along!”Mother Li flung Tian Zhifang’s hand away, “I must make them give me an explanation today! My Daughter’s life and death are still unknown, but Miss Ye has directly disappeared! My daughter has yet to be found, so what right does she have to disappear? How can there be such an irresponsible leader in the world?” ”

“Mother Li Cried, threw a tantrum, and hung herself. ”

“Mother Li insisted on this, so Tian Zhifang couldn’t say anything more. She turned around and walked toward the lounge. ”

“The base staff could understand her behavior. After all, it was mother Li’s only daughter who was in trouble. ”

On the other side.

In the northern hemisphere of Mars.

The little assistant was ready to die. She slowly closed her eyes and reached out to hold Yu Zifei’s hand.

“”Team leader Yu, don’t misunderstand. I’m just too scared by myself. I heard that the road to the netherworld can be dark.”If possible, she hoped that she could avoid drinking Meng Po’s soup. That way, she would remember her parents... ”

Yu Zifei couldn’t express his feelings. He really wanted to comfort the little assistant.

“But these past few days, he had said everything that he could comfort her with. ”

“At this moment, he had nothing else to say. ”

“Yu Zifei raised his head to look at the sky. At this moment, his eyes suddenly widened. “Li Xiang! Li Xiang! Quickly open your eyes!” ”

“What’s Wrong?”Li Xiang no longer had the strength to open his eyes.

“As the flying machine in the sky became more and more obvious, Yu Zifei’s pupils also became larger. “It’s Miss Ye! Miss Ye has come to save us!” ”

“”Team leader Yu, you’re hallucinating again, right?” ”

“Yu Zifei had already hallucinated three times today. This time, it was definitely still an illusion. ”

“Hearing this, Yu Zifei was stunned. The light in his eyes disappeared completely. ”

Yes.

He had already hallucinated several times today.

“The base was a hemisphere away from them, and this was Mars where information was blocked. It was really too difficult for them to find them! ”

“Thinking of this, Yu Zifei slowly closed his eyes and waited for death to come. ”

SWISH SWISH SWISH —

“At this moment, the familiar sound of an aircraft landing echoed in the air. ”

Then came Cen Hu’s surprised voice. “It’s old Yu and the others! Miss Ye! We’ve found Old Yu and assistant Xiao Li!”

Yu Zifei frowned. This illusion was too real!

“Li Xiang, who was standing by the side, thought, “It’s over, team leader Yu. I’m just like you now. I’m also hallucinating.” ”

“You heard it too?”Yu Zifei asked.

“”Yeah, maybe we’re going to die soon.” ”

“”You guys won’t die.”At this moment, a clear and shallow voice appeared in the air. ”

Why was this voice somewhat familiar?

Yes!

Miss Ye!

“Thinking of this, Yu Zifei and Li Xiang were about to open their eyes when the voice sounded again. “Don’t open your eyes yet.” ”

“Then, Yu Zifei felt an extremely thin needle being pushed into his skin. ”

“”Bring the nutrient solution over,”ye Zhuo continued. ”

Tang Mi and Cen Hu immediately brought the nutrient solution and fed it to Yu Zifei and Li Xiang.

“After drinking a bottle of nutrient solution, the two of them immediately felt much better. ”

Their physical strength was also slowly recovering.

“Yu Zifei asked, “Is it Miss Ye?” ”

“”Yes.”Ye Zhuo continued, “How are you feeling now?” ”

“”I’m very well.”Yu Zifei continued, “Miss Ye, thank you.” ”

“”Maintain your physical strength first. We’ll talk about it when we return to the base,”ye Zhuo said. ”

“”Okay,”Yu Zifei said. ”

“The little assistant cried out, “Miss Ye, thank you! I thought you were going to abandon me and team leader Yu. Thank you for not giving up on the search.”She thought that she would definitely die, she did not expect that she would be able to leave Mars alive. ”

“I will never give up on my companions.”

This ‘companions’made the little assistant’s emotions burst again.

“After a while, the little assistant continued, “I, I’m Not Dreaming, right?” ”

“Tang mi smiled and said, “Don’t worry, you’re Not Dreaming. We’re about to board the aircraft. You should rest well first. When you wake up again, you’ll be at the base.” ”

“”Okay.”The little assistant nodded. Then, she felt sleepy and fell asleep. ”

“Yu Zifei, who was beside her, had also fallen asleep. ”

“On the aircraft, ye Zao checked the bodies of the two of them again. After confirming that there were no problems, he went to the rest cabin to rest. ”

“Soon, the aircraft stopped at the entrance of the base. ”

Ye Zao also woke up at this time and walked out of the aircraft with everyone. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Mother Li stood up at this time and pointed at ye Zao, “Give Back My Daughter’s life! You Murderer.” ”

“”Mother!”At this time, the little assistant came out and stood in front of Ye Zhuo. ”
