Chen Siyao looked at Old Master Chen expectantly.

“Looking at Chen Siyao like this, Old Master Chen didn’t know what to say for a moment. ”

“Chen Siyao was full of anticipation, but he was going to disappoint Chen Siyao. ”

No.

It seemed like he still had to discuss with song Shiyu.

“”Grandpa, why aren’t you saying anything?”Chen siyao continued, “Is it Shiyu...” ”

“At the end of her sentence, Chen Siyao suddenly lowered her voice. ”

She was extremely disappointed.

It didn’t make sense.

It didn’t make sense.

“It didn’t make sense that old master Chen would personally make a move, and song Shiyu wouldn’t agree. ”

Song Shiyu was never someone who didn’t know how to be grateful.

“If he wasn’t grateful, the Chen family wouldn’t be what they are now. ”

“Old Master Chen looked up at Chen Siyao and smiled. “No, you’re thinking too much. Shiyu wasn’t at home when I went over this morning.” ”

“So you didn’t see Shiyu?”Chen Siyao asked.

“Yes.”Old Master Chen nodded.

Chen Siyao smiled. “I knew you would go in person. Shiyu wouldn’t refuse.”

“”Yes,”Old Master Chen said. ”

“Chen siyao continued to ask, “Grandfather, did you ask when Shiyu was at home?” ”

“”Yes, I did. We made an appointment to meet. You Don’t have to worry.”Old Master Chen pretended that nothing had happened, then he said, “You’re a big girl. Just wait for the good news in peace. It’s not appropriate to ask so many questions.” ”

“”Okay, okay, okay. I Won’t ask,”Chen Siyao said with a smile. ”

“Old Master Chen continued, “Then I’ll go back and rest first.” ”

“I’ll push you back.”Chen Siyao walked behind Old Master Chen.

Old Master Chen’s feelings were a little complicated.

“After pushing Old Master Chen back to his room, Chen Siyao said, “Grandfather, then you should rest well.” ”

“Okay.”Old Master Chen nodded.

Chen siyao walked out.

Old Master Chen looked at Chen Siyao’s back and frowned slightly.

How should he resolve this matter?

“After a moment, old master Chen called his assistant and asked his assistant to contact Bai Jiayu. ”

Bai Jiayu was one of Song Shiyu’s few good friends.

Bai Jiayu knew a lot of things that outsiders did not know.

It was definitely not a problem for him to ask Bai Jiayu for help.

“Bai Jiayu happened to be in Nanhai as well. After receiving Grandpa Chen’s call, he immediately rushed over. ”

“”Grandpa Chen, why are you looking for me?”Bai Jiayu rushed over. ”

“Old Master Chen chuckled and said, “Jiayu is here. Please have a seat.” ”

Bai Jiayu sat opposite Old Master Chen.

“Old Master Chen continued, “Jiayu, I actually asked you to come over this time because I have a favor to ask of you.” ”

“”What is it? Please tell me,”Bai Jiayu said. ”

“Old Master Chen sighed. “Speaking of which, I really have nowhere to put my old face.” ”

“Bai Jiayu continued, “Old Chen, we are not outsiders. If you have something to say, just say it. As long as it’s something I can do, I, Bai Jiayu, will definitely not say anything else!” ”

The reason why Bai Jiayu was so certain was entirely because of Song Shiyu.

“After all, Song Shiyu had always been very good to the Chen family. ”

It was all thanks to Song Shiyu that the Chen family had managed to survive the crisis.

“If it weren’t for song Shiyu, Bai Jiayu might not even know who the Chen family was. ”

“”Jiayu, since you’ve put it that way, I won’t stand on ceremony.”Grandfather Chen stroked his beard and started talking about himself, “I don’t know what that child Shiyu is thinking. Why Don’t you help me persuade him?” ” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“He sighed. “If Yaoyao hadn’t been so loyal to Shiyu, I wouldn’t have thrown away my old face.” ”

“Hearing this, Bai Jiayu frowned slightly. ”

What did old master Chen Mean by this?

It sounded more or less like he was forcing the marriage.

“Seeing that Bai Jiayu hadn’t said anything, Old Master Chen continued, “Jiayu, you’re not an outsider. To tell you the truth, if I were to hand Yaoyao over to an outsider, as a grandfather, I wouldn’t be at ease. But Shiyu is different. I watched Shiyu grow up. He has the ability and responsibility! “I know that he will definitely not let yaoyao down in the future.” ”

“These words were also indirectly telling Bai Jiayu that Chen Siyao wasn’t bad either. She was the daughter of a prestigious family. Even if she didn’t marry song Shiyu, she could still marry someone else. ”

It was song Shiyu’s loss that song Shiyu didn’t like Chen Siyao.

“”Old Chen, actually, I think that we should respect individual wishes in this matter. After all, it’s not sweet to force things,”Bai Jiayu continued. “You’ve watched Shiyu grow up. I don’t think anyone knows Shiyu’s personality better than you. As long as it’s something he doesn’t want, no one can force him!” ”
