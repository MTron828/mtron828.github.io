“Okay.”Eighty hair nodded.

...

On the other side.

Ye Shu and an Lizi sent Zhang Qingqing to the hotel.

Ye Shu looked at the environment in the hotel and frowned slightly. “You’re a double-bodied person now. You Can’t stay in the hotel all the time. Why Don’t you stay at my place first? There’s a maid at home who can take care of you!”

Ye Shu had also come out of this period. She knew what it was like for a girl to be pregnant without her relatives by her side.

It was precisely because she had experienced it that she couldn’t bear to let Zhang Qingqing experience the same thing.

“Although Zhang Qingqing wasn’t her daughter, when Zhang Qingqing became her daughter-in-law in the future, she would be no different from a daughter.”

“Hearing this, the corners of Zhang Qingqing’s lips curled up.”

She did not expect ye Shu to invite her to live with the Lin family so soon.

But now was not the time. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

She wanted to show ye Shu that she was different from other girls.

She was not the kind of person who would do anything just to marry into a wealthy family.

“If she immediately agreed to Ye Shu’s request, it would be too degrading!”

“Zhang Qingqing continued, “Thank you, Auntie. I appreciate your kindness. However, even though I’m the daughter of a small family, I know the rules. I don’t know Lin Ze very well now. If I were to stay at your house like this, I would inevitably be criticized.””

“Hearing this, Ye Shu nodded. If Zhang Qingqing really thought that way, she would be a reasonable child.”

“”That’s fine. If you need anything, you can tell Auntie, or Tell Lizi to tell me.””

“Okay.”Zhang Qingqing nodded.

“Ye Shu continued, “And your parents, do they know about this now?””

“Zhang Qingqing sighed, “I, I haven’t told them about this yet... my mother has always been strict with me. If she knew about this, she would definitely be angry...””

Zhang Qingqing’s words were telling ye Shu in a disguised way. She wasn’t the kind of person who didn’t have any upbringing. She and Lin Ze were completely in an accident.

“Ye Shu patted Zhang Qingqing’s hand, then, she said, “What should be said must be said. Even if you can hide from the first day of the Lunar New Year, you can’t hide from the fifteenth day of the Lunar New Year. Get your parents to come to Beijing as soon as possible. Let’s meet the parents of both sides first and settle the matter. We can’t drag this on any longer.””

“Okay.”Zhang Qingqing nodded. “I understand.”

“After giving some instructions, ye Shu and an Lizi left the hotel.”

After leaving the hotel.

“Ye Shu looked at an lizi and asked, “Lizi, searing won’t deny a person for no reason. You grew up with Zhang Qingqing and should be the person who knows her best. Are you sure there’s nothing wrong with her character?””

“”Aunty,”an Lizi didn’t know how to say it. Now that Zhang Qingqing was pregnant with Lin Ze’s child, Zhang Qingqing and Ye Shu were going to become mother-in-law and daughter-in-law in the future. She couldn’t sow discord in front of ye Shu.., “Girls sometimes have a little temper, but it’s not a big problem. Qingqing isn’t the kind of person with bad character.””

“Although Zhang Qingqing had some small problems with worshipping money, she really didn’t have any big problems!”

“Ye Shu nodded. Since an Lizi said so, there shouldn’t be any problems, but she was still a little worried because through her interactions with Zhang Qingqing, ye Shu always felt that Zhang Qingqing was a little strange... She couldn’t tell what she felt... ... Her Heart was in a mess.”

“An lizi continued, “Auntie, Qingqing actually wanted to have an abortion, but the Doctor said that her constitution was not suitable for an abortion. If this child was aborted, she would never be able to have another child in the future, so she did not choose to have an abortion. Although she had previously asked me to introduce her to a rich second-generation boyfriend, there is nothing wrong with her character. Don’t worry.””

“When she was young, Zhang Qingqing was indeed a good person. Every year, she would get a good student, and she loved stray cats and dogs very much.”

“However, an Lizi overlooked one thing.”

People change.

Zhang Qingqing was no longer the Zhang Qingqing that she knew.

“Things change, but people don’t take things seriously.”

“”Yeah,”ye Shu continued, “As long as there’s no big problem with her character, that’s good.””

“She did not look for her daughter-in-law. As long as her character was good, Lin Ze would agree.”

“Now that Zhang Qingqing was pregnant and her character was passable, she could only agree.”

Ye Shu returned to the Lin family home.

Ye Langhua and old Madam Lin were sitting in the living room chatting.

“Hearing footsteps, Ye Langhua hurriedly pushed old madam Lin out of the door. “Ah Shu is back!””
