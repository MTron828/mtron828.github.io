Chapter 133: 082: How does she match up to her? She doesn’t even have the slightest discernment! 6

How many days has it been?

Yourong mu continued, “Not only has auntie ye become rich, sister burning ye isn’t simple either.”

“She’s a trash, what can she do?”Xue Lin said speechlessly.

Yourong mu continued, “Sister Burning Ye is now a live broadcast big shot, she can earn quite a lot of money every day.”

Xue Lin snorted, “Is she the kind of streamer who flirts in front of a group of Smelly Men?”

“It’s not important what kind of streamer she is.”Mu Yourong picked up the cup and sniffed it. “What’s important is that she can earn money.”

“Shameless!”Xue Lin said in disgust, “She really has the same kind of daughter as her mother!”

Ye Shu was shameless. She was someone else’s mistress and gave birth to an illegitimate daughter.

Now, Ye Zao was also Shameless.

He was going to sell his meat on the Internet!

Disgusting!

Mu yourong sized up the expressions of the two sisters and said, “Sister Ye Zao’s live broadcast can earn three million! At the highest, she earned ten million in one night.”

“Pa!”

The silver spoon in Xue Lin’s hand fell to the ground.

Ten million in one night?

Xuan Lin was also shocked.

She helped others win a lawsuit and could only get 100,000 yuan in legal fees.

100,000 yuan in legal fees was a sky-high price for her!

10 million yuan?

She was a lawyer!

Zhuo ye was just an illegitimate daughter who didn’t know anything.

How could she get 10 million yuan without doing anything?

With her face?

God was really unfair!

Lin Xuan was full of jealousy.

After returning home, the two sisters told ye Shuang about this matter. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Ye Shuang immediately told ye Dafu and Yao Cuifen about this matter.

Hearing this, Yao Cuifen was so angry that she stomped her feet, “B * Tch! When you have money, you forget your mother and father! Her father and I are still alive! Yet, she didn’t even bring one or two pieces of meat with her during the new year! She made us old couple eat chaff at home while she enjoyed herself outside! If I had known this would happen, I would have strangled this unfilial daughter to death!”

Ye Dafu was furious as well. He took a puff of his cigarette and said, “Xiao Shuang, is what you said true?”

Ye Shuang nodded and took out her phone. “Look, these three stores are all Xiao Shu’s Now! Dad, let me tell you, this isn’t rented, but Xiao Shu bought it. It’s worth 20 million!”

20 million yuan!

Ye dafu stared at ye Shuang tightly, his pupils gradually dilating.

The most money he had ever seen in his life was 200,000 yuan.

20 million yuan?

Oh My God!

I’m Rich!

Their old ye family is going to be rich!

“You, is what you said true?”Ye Dafu looked at ye Shuang.

Ye shuang smiled and said, “Of course it’s true! Would I lie to You? “I say, Xiao Shu is too much. No matter what, we are still her family. But she has forgotten about us poor relatives after she became rich! “Forget about me, but she can’t forget who she forgot. She Can’t Forget About You and Dad! “After all, you are Xiao Shu’s biological parents!”

There were no parents in the world who weren’t parents.

No matter what had happened before, it couldn’t change the fact that ye Dafu and Yao Cuifen were ye Shu’s biological parents.

As long as they were related by blood.

Ye Shu had to fulfill her duty of providing for them!

Yao Cuifen was so angry that she started cursing.

She kept calling her a little slut.

She kept calling her a little slut.

She did not even repeat herself.

Ye shuang comforted her, “Mom, why are you so angry with your own daughter? No matter what, you and dad are her parents. Xiao Shu is not married now. She was born into the Ye family, and she is a ghost of the ye family if she dies. All of her things are still yours! “Shu is a woman after all, and her education level isn’t high. She still has a burden by her side. How would she have the time to manage the restaurant? “Such a good business, what if it fails at her hands?”

Speaking up to this point, ye shuang paused and continued, “In my opinion, we should let Xiao Shuai take over the restaurant. Xiao Shuai and his sister-in-law are scholars after all. This scholar is definitely better at doing business than a blind person!”

Ye Shuai was the most promising person in the entire ye family.

He was also the successor of the Ye family.

It was most suitable for ye Shuang and her wife to take over the Ye family’s private restaurant

Ye Shu didn’t know anything. She hadn’t even graduated from primary school and was illiterate. What kind of business would she do?

She probably had good luck to be able to do so well in business.

But would luck continue to be good?

After all, this was their old ye family’s property!

Hearing this, Yao Cuifen’s eyes lit up and she quickly nodded. “Right! Shuangshuang, you’re right. We should let Shuangzi take over the restaurant. When Shuangzi manages the restaurant, your sister-in-law is an accountant, so she can manage the accounts!”
