Translator: 549690339

Li hang raised his head and saw a tall orange tree not far away.

Two or three oranges with yellow skin were very dazzling among the green leaves.

“Li Hang walked to the orange tree and picked an orange. He raised his head and looked in front of him. Then, he sat on the wooden chair under the Orange Tree. He held the orange in one hand and closed his eyes to take a nap. ”

She even specially tidied her hair and lifted the hem of her skirt to the roots of her legs.

One or two leaves fell on her skirt. Everything looked so fresh and natural. It was like the innocence of a photographer.

Li Hang took a nap while secretly looking forward.

“Seeing a figure getting closer and closer to him, Li Hang immediately closed his eyes, making everything more natural and unadorned. ”

The footsteps were getting closer and closer.

Li hang could clearly feel that the figure stopped in front of her. Its gaze was deep and locked onto her tightly.

Its gaze was filled with curiosity and amazement.

“Li Hang became more and more nervous. His heart rate increased, but she still told herself not to be nervous. ”

She had to be calm.

Once.

It was only once. She did not expect that she would win that person’s gaze with just a little trick.

“Ah!”

“At this moment, a scream suddenly came from the air. ”

“Someone died!”

“Someone died here!”

“Li hang was so scared that he quickly opened his eyes. When he opened his eyes, he saw a terrified face. ”

This face was very close to her.

The owner of the face had two ponytails and was staring at her without blinking.

“Li hang was like a frightened bird. He immediately stood up from the chair, “Who are you! What do you want!” ”

“”So you’re not dead! I thought you were dead!”That person said while patting his chest, “You’re really strange!” ”

“Li hang was very speechless. She thought that someone else was walking over, but who would have thought that a crazy woman dressed strangely and dressed strangely. ”

“The woman looked to be in her thirties, but she was wearing an exaggerated skirt, twin ponytails, and her facial expression was also very exaggerated. ”

“You’re the one who’s dead! How unlucky!”Li hang naturally would not continue to pretend in front of a lunatic.

“”I’m not dead, I can breathe. Look, I still have a Shadow!” ”

Li hang could not be bothered with her and turned around to leave.

“At this moment, he saw the Lin family’s butler leading a group of people in this direction. “Miss Guanghua, Miss Guanghua, Are You Alright?” ”

Miss Guanghua?

Could it be this crazy woman behind him?

Li hang turned around.

“He saw the crazy woman waving her hand. “I’m fine, I’m fine. It’s just that I thought this woman was dead just now. She was just lying on the chair like this. I looked at her for a long time, but she didn’t say a word...” ”

“As Guanghua spoke, she imitated Li Hang’s appearance and even pulled the hem of her skirt up to her legs. ”

The Butler took a glance at Li hang and immediately understood what had happened.

“In all these years in the Lin family, what had he not seen? ”

Couldn’t these girls walk the Righteous Path?

They only wanted to take shortcuts all day long.

Did they really think that the nobles had no eyes and could take a fancy to anyone?

“Li hang wished he could find a hole in the ground and hide. He could only bite the bullet and say,”... Butler Zhou, there might be some misunderstanding.” ”

“Butler Zhou raised his formal smile and said, “Miss Li, the banquet hall is over here.” ”

Li Hang had no choice but to walk forward.

“The Butler smiled and looked at Guanghua. “Miss Guanghua, the Old Madam is looking for you. Please follow me quickly.” ”

“Guanghua nodded and happily held onto the butler’s arm. She skipped forward and said, “Then let’s go quickly! Don’t make Grandma Wait so anxiously!” ” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Okay.”

Li Hang walked in front and turned around to look curiously.

Who Was this Guanghua Miss?

She seemed to be a little unusual.

“Although the interlude was a little unpleasant, when they arrived at the banquet hall, Li Hang still maintained the most appropriate smile on his face. ”

No one else had seen him just now.

“There was a fool, a butler, and a group of servants. ”

They were all low-class people. There was nothing to be afraid of.

“When Li Hang arrived at the banquet hall, he happened to see an Lizi. He immediately jogged over. “Lizi.” ”

“Li Hang.”

“Li Hang’s smile did not change, but he was a little unhappy in his heart. This was also the reason why she looked down on an Lizi. ”

“An Lizi was always like this. They were obviously cousins, but an Lizi called her by her first and last name. ”

She didn’t respect people at all!

“”Lizi, Congratulations, you are really a man and a woman with your boyfriend!”Li Hang said something that went against his heart, but there was no expression on his face that went against his heart. ”
