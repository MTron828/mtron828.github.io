“Plus, Wu Lan really committed suicide. ”

“So, this matter could only be settled this way. ”

“Now, who still remembered Wu Lan? ”

“Every time she thought of Wu Lan, Xie Wanqiu’s heart was extremely happy. ”

So what if Wu Lan was the eldest daughter of a rich family?

So what if she was true love with Zhou Zuolong?

“In the end, she still lost to her! ”

“At that time, Wu Lan lost in her hands, even lost his life, but Zhou Xiang does not still have to call her a mother? ”

“Not only did Wu Lan lose to her,. ”

And it was a complete failure!

“Today, Wu Lan’s grandson still has to kneel at the feet of his granddaughter. ”

The whole Cen family will be theirs!

“Thought of here, Xie wanqiu does not trace ground curved up the corner of the lips. ”

“Zhou zuolong said, “Wanqiu, what are you talking about! What do you mean by you are basking in Wu Lan’s glory? It was clearly Wu Lan who basked in your glory! If it wasn’t for Zhou Xiang, how could Ying ‘ER have left so early?” ”

Xie wanqiu sighed. “That is Ying ‘ER’s fate. I Don’t blame anyone.”

Zhou Zuolong turned to look at Xie wanqiu. “You even said that yinyin is soft-hearted. Aren’t you also soft-hearted? yinyin that child is very much like you!”

“Xie wanqiu smiled and said, “Alright, let’s not talk about this anymore. Did you go to Xiangxiang’s place today and tell her about yinyin and Shaoqing? How did Xiangxiang React?” ”

Zhou Zuolong snorted coldly. “How did she react? What reaction could she have? Our Yinyin is so outstanding. Being able to marry Shaoqing is also a blessing for Shaoqing and the CEN family. How could she refuse?”

“Hearing this, Xie wanqiu said in surprise, “So, Xiangxiang agreed?” ”

“Although she knew that Zhou Xiang listened to Zhou Zuolong’s words, Xie Wanqiu was still very surprised when she heard the whole result. ”

“After all, there was still a dead old woman in the Cen family. ”

“Zhou Zuolong held Xie Wanqiu’s arm. “Zhou Xiang is the same as Wu Lan. They are both ungrateful things. I gave her three days to consider. After three days, Shaoqing will announce the engagement with yinyin.” ”

It turned out that she had not agreed. The smile on Xie Wanqiu’s face faded a little. “How do you know that Shaoqing will do as you say three days later?”

“”Just because I’m his grandfather! If he doesn’t listen to me, who else does he want to listen to?”Zhou zuolong continued, “Besides, yinyin is so much better than ye Zhuo. Shaoqing will be more than happy when he hears about this! How can he refuse!” ”

Zhou Zuolong was still very confident in Zheng Wanyin.

Xie wanqiu narrowed her eyes and was about to say something when Zhou Zuolong’s phone suddenly rang.

“Zhou Zuolong picked up the phone. “Okay, your grandmother and I will be back soon.” ”

“After hanging up the phone, Xie wanqiu asked, “Is it yinyin calling?” ”

“Yes.”Zhou Zuolong nodded. “Yinyin has bought the food back. Let’s go back.”

“Okay.”Xie wanqiu followed Zhou Zuolong’s footsteps.

The two of them returned to the ward together.

“Zheng Wanyin had already placed the food on the table. “Grandpa and Grandma, quickly sit down and eat.” ”

The table was filled with Zhou Zuolong and Xie Wanqiu’s favorite food.

“Looking at the large table of food, Zhou Zuolong felt a myriad of emotions in his heart. ” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Zheng Wanyin was not related to him by blood, yet she treated him so well. ”

“Then, he looked at his biological granddaughters. ”

“He had been in the capital for more than a day, but the four sisters, Cen Yuying, Cen Yueya, Cen Yueying, and Cen Yuyan, did not say anything. ”

“Not to mention the fact that he had rushed from his hometown to the capital, just looking at how long Xie Wanqiu had been in the hospital, it was unfilial of the four sisters not to come and see Xie Wanqiu. ”

Who Was Xie Wanqiu?

“She was their grandmother, an elder. ”

“If it was that old woman from the Cen family, they would definitely have come to the hospital long ago. ”

“In the end, they still did not have Xie Wanqiu as a grandmother in their hearts. ”

“Seeing Zhou Zuolong like this, Zheng Wanyin asked with concern, “Grandpa, what happened to You?” ”

“”Nothing,”Zhou zuolong continued, “During the days when your grandmother was in the hospital, did your four cousins come over to see her?” ”

“Zheng Wanyin shook her head and said, “Eldest cousin, second cousin, and third cousin have their own families. They’re all quite busy. Fourth Cousin hasn’t returned from overseas yet.” ”

“Xie wanqiu smiled and said, “Look at you, old man, asking questions! Why would I want them to see me? It’s not like I have some incurable disease!” ”

“Zhou Zuolong felt a little uncomfortable. “Although that’s what you said, you’re their grandmother after all. You still have to do what you should do. After all, there’s no circle without rules.” ”

“”Forget it, forget it. They’re all our children. Why bother with them?” ”
