Translator: 549690339

“”Okay, no problem.” ”

“Third Cousin’s wife was still a little worried, so she continued to instruct, “Little twelve, if Tao Tao makes trouble for you later, call me immediately!” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“After repeatedly exhorting her, third cousin’s wife finally left ye Zao’s room with ease. ”

“Cen Shaoqing looked at the little bean in ye Zao’s arms, who was not even wearing pants. He suddenly felt that it was a bit of an eyesore. He found a scarf and said, “I think Tao Tao is a little cold. Why don’t we give him a scarf?” ”

“Ye Zao looked at the temperature in the room and said, “It’s okay. I don’t feel cold.” ”

“We are adults. Tao Tao is only five months old.”

“Ye Zao felt that Cen Shaoqing’s words were quite reasonable. He nodded and said, “Then let’s give him a scarf.” ” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Ye Zao originally thought that Cen Shaoqing would wrap the scarf around little bean’s neck. He didn’t expect that Cen Shaoqing would tie the scarf around little bean’s stomach. He slightly raised his eyebrows and asked, “Do you know how to tie a scarf?” ”

Cen Shaoqing slightly raised his eyes. “Children are more likely to catch a cold in the stomach.”

“Really?”Ye Zao slightly raised his eyebrows.

“Of course.”

“After fastening the scarf, Cen Shaoqing reached out to ye zhuo, “Let me hug it?” ”

“”No, Tao Tao Zhi Sheng.”Ye Zhuo turned to look at tiger head, White Chubby Tao Tao, could not help but in his face a big kiss, “Tao Tao is really too cute!” ”

“After a kiss and a kiss, the little bean was amused to laugh. ”

“All of this happened too fast, Cen Shaoqing directly froze. ”

His heart was filled with jealousy.

“Cen Shaoqing’s expression did not change. “Leader, let’s discuss the plan to develop an aircraft carrier now, shall we?” ”

Ye Zhuo acted as if he did not hear Cen Shaoqing’s words and teased little bean with the little yellow duck. “Does Tao Tao like this little yellow duck?”

Cen Shaoqing’s breathing stopped. He clenched the Buddha Pearl in his hand and increased the decibel. “Leader!”

“Perhaps it was because his voice was too loud, the little bean in ye Zao’s arms trembled in fear. ”

Ye Zao turned to look at Cen Shaoqing. “Can’t You Lower Your Voice? You’re so scared.”

Cen Shaoqing:”...”

“Ye Zao continued, “What did you call me for?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddha bead. “Didn’t you say that you wanted to develop an aircraft carrier? Let’s discuss the preliminary plan, shall we?” ”

“Ye Zao said, “I’m not free now. I want to take care of the child.” ”

“CEN Shaoqing said, “Put him on the bed. We’ll look at him while we discuss the plan.” ”

“Tao Tao was very obedient. As long as ye Zao was beside him and gave him some toys, he could sit on the bed and play by himself. ”

“Ye Zao frowned slightly. “That won’t do. Since I promised third sister-in-law to help take care of Tao Tao, then I have to be responsible for Tao Tao. How can I put Tao Tao on the side? Let’s Talk About Us!” ”

Little Bean hugged ye Zao very cooperatively.

“No one could throw him on the bed, or else he would cry for him to see! ”

“Ye Zao was amused by Little Bean and smiled. “Tao Tao, don’t worry. Aunt Won’t leave you alone on the bed.” ”

Little Bean smacked ye Zao’s face and kissed him.

“Just when Little Bean wanted to kiss him for a second time, CEN Shaoqing immediately reached out and covered ye Zao’s face. ”

“Therefore, little bean kissed Cen Shaoqing’s hand. ”

“Wow!”

“Realizing that she wasn’t kissing ye Zao’s face, Little Bean was so angry that she cried out loud. ”

Cen Shaoqing:”...”

“Ye Zao rolled his eyes at Cen Shaoqing. “Why do you owe me so much?”Then, he turned to look at little bean and coaxed, “Tao Tao, let’s not cry. Uncle is a big bad guy. Let’s ignore him. Is Tao Tao Hungry?” ”

“Seeing that it was not easy to coax Tao Tao, ye Zhuo continued, “Cen Shaoqing, Wash Tao Tao’s milk powder. Twenty milliliters will do. Remember to use warm water.” ”

“Not only did Cen Shaoqing not dare to say no, but he also had to wash the milk powder for his love rival. ”

“Fortunately, third cousin sister-in-law came back soon, or else Cen Shaoqing would have collapsed. ”

The next day.

In the southern base.

All the high-level personnel of the base had gathered in the meeting room and were discussing animatedly.

“Do any of you know what kind of meeting fifth master is calling us to?”

“I’m not sure.”

“I’m not sure either.”

“Could it be that miss ye is going to join our base? I just saw fifth master and Miss Ye coming together.”

Ye Zhuo was going to join the base?

“Hearing this, Tang Xue’s eyes were filled with confusion. ”

“At this moment, the sound of light footsteps came from outside the meeting room. ”

Everyone immediately sat up straight.

“The next second, the conference room door was pushed open. ”

Two figures walked in from outside.

One was tall and slender.

The other had a jade-like figure.

It was Cen Shaoqing and Ye Zhuo.
