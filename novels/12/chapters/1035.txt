Xi Muwen let out a sigh of relief and turned to look at Yang Jiao. “Are you sure that’s what she said?”

“”Of course!”Yang Jiao continued, “I heard it with my own ears, how could it be wrong?””

“Xi Muwen picked up the briefcase on the table. “Then, I’ll make a trip to the company first. If ye Langhua comes back, you must call me!””

“”Okay, don’t worry!””

“Xi Corporation had a sudden incident, and now everyone was in danger. When the Secretary saw Xi Muwen coming over, she immediately went up to him. “CEO XI! You’re here!””

“XI muwen continued, “How’s the situation now?””

The secretary frowned. “The situation isn’t very optimistic. CEO Ye From Ye Corporation will be here soon to handle the handover.”

“Ye Group? Which Ye Group?”Xi Muwen asked.

“The secretary explained, “It’s... It’s the ye group that bought our group.””

Ye Group?

CEO Ye?

Was there such a person in Beijing?

Xi Muwen was very confused. “When will they arrive?”

“The secretary said, “Twenty minutes.””

“I understand.”Xi Muwen nodded. “You can go out First!”

“Okay.”The secretary bent down and walked out.

Twenty minutes passed very quickly. The secretary came to inform Xi Muwen that the people from ye group had arrived and asked Xi Muwen to go to the meeting room.

Xi Muwen immediately put down the cigarette in his hand and walked towards the meeting room.

“Just as he pushed the door open, he saw a familiar figure sitting in the meeting room.”

“Lang Hua!”

Xi Muwen did not expect the person to be ye Langhua. The worry in his eyes turned into joy.

“Without thinking, he knew that ye Langhua was definitely here to help him!”

Ye Langhua looked up slightly. “I’m here.”

“Xi muwen continued, “Langhua, where have you been? Why didn’t you answer your phone?””

“Sign this document.”Ye Langhua pushed the document in front of Xi Muwen.

“Xi Muwen looked down and saw that it was the acquisition contract, he smiled and said, “We’re all family, there’s no need to make things up! “Langhua, I really didn’t expect ye group’s CEO Ye to be you! “Thank you, thank you for helping me at such a crucial time! “Langhua, I will always remember your kindness!””

“From XI Muwen’s point of view, the reason ye Langhua set up ye group to acquire XI group was because of him.”

She wanted to help him.

“Even though ye Langhua was already old, her love for him was not fake.”

“Back then, so many people had stopped them from getting together, but ye Langhua still chose him.”

She was even willing to pay the price!

Ye Langhua just looked at Xi Muwen like this.

She could not tell what expression was on her face.

How could she not have noticed before that Xi Muwen was such a heartless thing?

Thirty-six years.

A whole thirty-six years.

“To others, this was just a story.”

“But to her, it really happened.”

“XI muwen continued, “Oh right, Lang Hua, have you received Weiyue’s call? Weiyue said that she was chased out by Zhao Xueyin from the Shunxi Financial Group! Zhao Xueyin even wanted to remove her identity as the heir. Is there some misunderstanding in the process?””

“”A Family?”Ye Langhua’s lips curled into a mocking smile. “Xi Muwen, how dare you mention a family to me!””

“Xi Muwen frowned. “Langhua, what do you mean?””

“I know everything.”Ye Langhua’s tone was calm.

“Xi Muwen’s heart skipped a beat, but his expression remained the same. “What do you know?””

“”Xi Muwen, stop pretending!”Ye Langhua turned to look at Xi Muwen. “You’ve been pretending in front of me for 36 years. Aren’t you tired?””

Did Ye Langhua find out about what happened 36 years ago?

No!

It couldn’t be!

“It had already been 36 years, how could it be so easy to find out.”

“Xi muwen continued, “Langhua, I know you’ve been blaming me, blaming me for marrying Yang Jiao, but I only married Yang Jiao after we went through the divorce procedures! “I’ve never done anything wrong to you during our marriage! “If you think about it from another perspective, I’m just a normal man”

“”After half a month has passed, I’m sadder than anyone else! Including you, my mother!””

“Xi Muwen was almost in tears, extremely sad.”

He looked as if he was really sad for half a month.

“From his expression, one could not tell that half a month’s disappearance had anything to do with him.”

This was also the reason why ye Langhua had never suspected Xi Muwen.

“Ever since Little Half Moon was born, Xi Muwen had been like her and grandfather Ye, Pampering Little Half Moon.”
