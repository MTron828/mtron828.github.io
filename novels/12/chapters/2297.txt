Translator: 549690339

How could Lin Ze match up to Bai Jingshu?

An earthling who didn’t even have a household registration in the S Galaxy!

This kind of person didn’t even have the right to sweep trash in the S Galaxy! 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Zhou Ying continued, “Dad, do you know how the public is laughing at us now? Aren’t you bringing shame to the entire Bai Family?” ”

“The public was laughing at the short-sightedness of the Bai family. Because Lin ze was ye Zao’s older brother, they couldn’t wait to marry their daughter over. Little did they know that Lin Ze was a low-class person. ”

“It would have been fine if they could benefit from it, but the problem now was that not only were their parents unable to benefit from it, they were also humiliated. Who could bear it? ”

“In short, Bai Jiacheng and Zhou Ying would never allow Bai Jingshu to be with Lin Ze! ”

“Jingshu has nothing to do with you guys anymore. You Don’t have the right to point fingers here!”Elder Bai said.

“”Dad, blood ties are as thick as water. Isn’t That What You Said?”Bai Jiacheng looked at elder Bai, “Dad, can you think about us! Think for the reputation of our Bai family! It’s one thing for you to Pamper Jingshu, but what time is it now? What kind of place is earth? I really don’t know if you love Jingshu or are harming her!” ”

“In Bai Jiasheng’s opinion, Old Master Bai was just old and muddle-headed. ”

Bai Jingshu was well-off and beautiful. She could marry anyone she wanted?

Why did she have to marry an earthling?

“Get lost! Get lost right now! I’ll say it again. Jingshu is only my granddaughter. She has nothing to do with you!”

“Bai Jiacheng was a little angry when he heard this, he looked at elder Bai and said, “Dad, you don’t have to scare me with these words! Do you think we want to have a daughter like this! If you really say so, then let’s completely cut ties! “From now on, we won’t have a daughter like Bai Jingshu anymore!” ”

A daughter who had brought shame to the family!

Zhou Ying stepped forward at the right time. “Jiacheng is right! We won’t have a daughter like that in the future!”

“In fact, the main purpose of the couple’s visit was to stop Bai Jingshu and Lin Ze from getting together. Since they couldn’t stop them now, they could only cut ties with Bai Jingshu. ”

“”Okay, okay, okay!”Elder Bai nodded. “That’s for the best!” ”

“After saying that, elder Bai turned to look at the butler beside him. “Go get a letter of termination!” ”

“After signing the letter of termination, Bai Jingshu had no relationship with Bai Jiacheng and Zhou Ying anymore. ”

Filial piety was the most important thing in the s galaxy.

“If Bai Jingshu had taken the initiative to bring it up, she would definitely have been criticized. However, the situation was different now. This matter was brought up by elder Bai, Bai Jiacheng, and Zhou Ying. ”

“Although Bai Jiacheng and Zhou Ying were Bai Jingshu’s parents, Old Master Bai was also Bai Jiacheng and Zhou Ying’s father-in-law. ”

It was most appropriate for old master bai to handle this matter.

He would not be talked about in the future.

Bai Jiacheng and Zhou Ying looked at each other and saw a satisfied look in each other’s eyes.

“Based on the current situation, it was better to cut ties with Bai Jingshu as soon as possible so that Bai Jingshu would not drag down their parents in the future. ”

“They had raised Bai Jingshu up so well, and they were not going to let her drag them down. ”

“Soon, the Butler brought the letter of termination over, and Bai Jingshu followed. ”

“As the person involved in signing the letter of termination with her parents, she naturally could not be absent. ”

“Ever since she found out that her parents were going to clone her, Bai Jingshu had lost all hope of her parents, even when she found out that their parents were going to sign the letter of termination with her. ”

“Just like Zhou Ying, Bai Jiacheng pretended that he had lost his daughter a long time ago. He picked up the letter of divorce and signed it immediately. ”

“After Bai Jiacheng and Zhou Ying signed it, Bai Jingshu also signed the letter of divorce very quickly. ”

“Seeing how determined Bai Jingshu was, Zhou Ying’s eyes turned red. After all, she was Bai Jingshu’s biological mother. If it weren’t for her, there wouldn’t have been Bai Jingshu. But now.., bai Jingshu actually had no attachment to her mother at all. ”

What a waste of time!

“Old Master Bai put away the letter of termination. “Let’s Go! From now on, you won’t have anything to do with Jingshu anymore!”This could be considered as putting an end to old master Bai’s worries. ”

“Zhou Ying turned to look at Bai Jingshu, trying to see the reluctance on her face. ”

“Unfortunately, there wasn’t any. ”

“From the beginning to the end, there was not a hint of reluctance on Bai Jingshu’s face. She looked at them as if they were strangers. ”

Zhou Ying did not understand why Bai Jingshu would be so heartless.
