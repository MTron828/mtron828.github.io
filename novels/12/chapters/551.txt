S 3?

“Little Chu rubbed her eyes, thinking that she had seen wrongly. ”

That was because the bottom right corner of a normal person’s eyes was a 1.

S 3 was the symbol of a special group of people.

Could it be that this miss ye had a great background?

“Little Chu released the mouse and looked at Sun Peiyuan. “Chief Sun, there’s a problem here. Please come over.” ”

“What’s Wrong?”Sun Peiyuan turned around.

Little Chu’s expression was a little complicated. “You’ll know when you come over and take a look.”

Sun Peiyuan walked over and looked at the computer screen. “Is there a problem here?”

Little Chu pointed at the watermark at the bottom right corner. “Look here.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

When he looked.

Sun Peiyuan was also stunned.

S3?

A special group of people?

His many years of work experience told Sun Peiyuan that this was no small matter. He might even lose his job.

Sun Peiyuan straightened his expression. “Wait a moment.”

“Okay.”Little Chu nodded.

Sun Peiyuan went outside to give Zhao Shuqi a call.

“Zhao Shuqi had been busy with his promotion recently. He had many matters to handle personally, so he didn’t have the time to answer unimportant calls. ”

“However, Zhao Shuqi didn’t pick up the phone. ”

“Sun Peiyuan didn’t dare to make the decision to change ye Zhuo’s name, so he could only keep calling. ”

“In a flash, forty minutes had passed. ”

“In the office, Old Mrs. Lin said uneasily, “Shuning, didn’t that little sun say that it would be done in half an hour? It’s already been forty minutes, why isn’t he here yet? Do you think something will go wrong?” ”

“Zhao shuning smiled and patted old Mrs. Lin’s hand. “Don’t worry, with my brother around, nothing will go wrong. Let’s Wait a little longer.” ”

Old Lady Lin nodded.

“In the blink of an eye, another hour and a half had passed. ”

“This time, even Zhao shuning couldn’t sit still. ”

Old Lady Lin looked at Zhao shuning. “Why don’t you call your brother and ask him?”

“Okay.”Zhao shuning nodded and picked up his phone to call Zhao Shuqi’s private number.

“Zhao Shuqi was extremely busy. When he received Zhao Shuning’s call, he said angrily, “How does this Little Sun Do Things? Didn’t I already tell him? Just wait! I’ll call him right away!” ”

“”Okay, brother, hurry up and make the call! I’ve been waiting for more than an hour!” ”

“After hanging up Zhao Shuning’s call, Zhao Shuqi immediately called Sun Peiyuan. ”

“When he received Zhao Shuqi’s call, Sun Peiyuan felt as if he had been pardoned. He was just about to say something when he was scolded by Zhao Shuqi, “Sun Peiyuan, is your efficiency that bad? My Sister has been waiting for an hour, and you haven’t finished your work yet! Let me ask you, do you not want to rise up?” ”

“”No, no! Director Zhao, this is a misunderstanding! Listen to me...” ”

Zhao Shuqi was very forceful. “I don’t have time to listen to you! I only want the result! Go and finish this matter right now! Tell my sister and the others to go back!”

“Sun Peiyuan was so anxious that his face was red. He quickly said, “Director Zhao, the Miss Ye That You Asked Me to change her name, she’s an S3 character. Now, she’s not here in person, and without her consent...” ”

“Zhao Shuqi directly interrupted Sun Peiyuan’s words, “Isn’t it enough that you have my consent? Whose consent do you want? Sun Peiyuan, whose consent do you want? I order you to do this right now! Otherwise, you’ll have to bear the consequences!” ”

“After saying this, Zhao Shuqi hung up the phone. ”

Who else did he need to consent to change the name of a nineteen-year-old girl?

“Zhao Shuqi had been very busy recently, but he didn’t have time to waste on such matters. ”

“Looking at the phone that was hung up, Sun Peiyuan’s face was bitter. ”

“Little Chu asked carefully, “That director sun... What should we do now?” ”

“Change!”

“Little Chu asked with some uncertainty, “Director Sun, are you sure?” ”

Sun Peiyuan nodded. “Change it.”

“Since Zhao Shuqi had already said so, he must have already confirmed ye Zhuo’s identity. ”

“Little Chu began to change ye Zhuo’s information. As he did so, he said, “Actually, I still think that calling him ye zhuo sounds better. Zhao Linzhuo seems a little strange.” ”

“Ten minutes later, Sun Peiyuan brought the revised information to the office. ”

“When she saw Sun Peiyuan, old madam Lin immediately stood up. “Little Sun, has the matter been settled?” ”

“Sun Peiyuan handed the information to Old Madam Lin. “Old Madam, it’s already been settled.” ”

“Hearing this, Old Madam Lin’s eyes lit up. “Really?” ”

“Yes.”

“Old Madam Lin took the information and looked at the changed name. She laughed so hard that she couldn’t even see her eyes. “Good, good, good! Shu Ning! This matter has been handled too well!” ”

Zhao Linzhuo.

“No matter what, this name sounded better than ye Zhuo’s. ”
