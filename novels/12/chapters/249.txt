Translator: 549690339

“An Lizi said, “I heard that the College Entrance Examination Champion’s score will be released a little later than ours. Zhuozhuo, did you get into the College Entrance Examination Champion?” ”

“D * MN! Our School has a champion!”Zhao Pingting was even happier than if she had gotten into the college entrance examination champion.

“Ye Zhuozhuo shook his head. “I don’t know what’s going on either! But congratulations to all of you, Pingting and Lizi. All of you will be able to fulfill your dreams for Your School.” ”

“Zhao pingting said, “Zao Zao, when your results are out, the three of us should find some time to get together.” ”

“Sure.”

“The three of them chatted for more than 40 minutes. Just as they hung up the video call, Ye Sen and ye Shu walked over and asked, “Zao Zao, did you get the results? How was the exam?” ”

“Ye Zao said, “The system seems to have made a mistake. I didn’t get the results.” ”

“How could this be?”Ye Sen looked puzzled.

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “It’s fine, it’s fine. Just Wait a little longer. It’s fine even if the results aren’t ideal. At most, we can make up for another year.” ”

“”Right, right, right. Your mother is right. Zao Zao, don’t be anxious.” ”

“After comforting ye Zao, Ye Shu and Ye Sen went out to work. ”

“Actually, Ye Zao wasn’t the only one who was puzzled. ”

“There was also ye Zao’s form teacher, Jiang Wenhui. ”

“Ever since the results of the college entrance examination came out, he had been staring at the computer screen. However, when he entered ye Zao’s admission card number and ID card number, there was no reaction on the computer. ”

What was going on?

How could there be no reaction?

“Logically speaking, the scores should have been out by now! ”

Qian Dabao also turned on his computer and checked Han Lei’s score.

Han Lei had a high score of 743 points!

He was only seven points away from full score.

He was ranked second in the city.

“Seeing this result, Qian Dabao was very happy. ”

Even though Han Lei did not get first place in the city.

But second place in the city was not bad either!

“Qian Dabao stood up with a smile and looked at Jiang Wenhui, who was sitting not far from him. “How is it, teacher Jiang? Have you checked the results of your classmate, Ye Zhuo? She must have gotten a very high score, right?” ”

Jiang Wenhui’s expression was a little ugly. “The results of our classmate ye Zao haven’t been released yet.”

“”They haven’t been released yet?”Qian Dabao’s eyes revealed a hint of sarcasm, “Teacher Jiang, don’t struggle on your deathbed! Under normal circumstances, only the results of the top scorer would be delayed. Even the results of our classmate Han Lei can be found out, but the results of your classmate ye Zao can’t be found out? Do you know how many points our classmate Han Lei scored? Second in the city!” ”

“”If you can’t find it, then you can’t find it! Why do you talk so much nonsense!”Jiang Wenhui said as he clicked the mouse to search. ”

At this moment.

The computer page suddenly refreshed.

Jiang Wenhui looked at the form on the computer and was so excited that he let out a groundhog-like scream.

“Ah!” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“”Teacher Jiang, what’s wrong? Are you scared by your students’results?”Qian Dabao smiled and said, “Actually, we already know that your class ye Zao plagiarized, so don’t think that you have no face! Which poor student doesn’t want to plagiarize? You Can’t control this! The teachers in our office can understand you!” ”

“Hearing this, the other teachers in the office all looked at Jiang Wenhui with different expressions. ”

Plagiarism!

It would be disgraceful if word got out!

“In the next second, Jiang Wenhui jumped up excitedly! ”

“First! Our class’s God Ye got first place! She’s the city’s top scorer! Our class has a city’s top scorer!”

“”City’s top scorer?”Qian Dabao’s face was full of sarcasm. “Teacher Jiang, what time is it now! Stop Daydreaming!” ”

“At this moment, the principal ran in excitedly from outside the door and grabbed Jiang Wenhui’s hand, “Teacher Jiang! Congratulations! The higher-ups called to say that your classmate ye Zao has obtained a high score of 749 points! He is the top scorer in our Yunjing City! Hurry up and get ready, there will be a television station coming to interview you in a while!” ”

749 points?

Top Scorer?

“Hearing this, Qian Dabao was stunned. ”

The other teachers in the office were also stunned and came to Jiang Wenhui’s desk.

Ye Zhuo’s results were displayed on the computer screen.

Chinese: 149 points.

Mathematics: 150 points.

Foreign Language: 150 points.

Synthesis: 300 points.

National Policy Bonus Points: 0

Local policy bonus points: 0

Total score: 749 points.

“Both of the bonus points were 0. In other words, Ye Zhuo scored 749 points in the naked exam! ”

Even the students who scored the bonus points did not score as high as her.

The office was filled with congratulations.

“Jiang Wenhui was in high spirits. “Everyone, don’t leave after school tonight. It’s my treat! It’s my treat!” ”

Qian Dabao sat in front of his desk with a defeated look on his face.
