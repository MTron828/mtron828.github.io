Cao Wei massaged his temples. It seemed like he had to find the real half a month soon.

“Otherwise, the consequences would be unimaginable. ”

“Thinking of this, Cao Wei sighed. ”

“The young woman standing beside Cao Wei saw Cao Wei like this and could not help but say, “Are you so sure that Xi Muwen is lying to Aunty Lang? What if he really found half a month?” ”

“Cao Wei raised his head. “I suspect that Xi Muwen was the mastermind behind half a month’s disappearance back then. Since he planned to throw half a month away, why would he bring her back at a time like this?”Knowing that half a month was Aunty Lang’s life.., that was why Cao Wei had been investigating the real reason for half a month’s disappearance all these years. ”

The reason he did not tell Aunty Lang was because he had not found any actual evidence yet.

“The woman frowned slightly. “A tiger will not eat its cubs. Xi Muwen should not have laid a hand on his own daughter. Moreover, doing this would not benefit him at all.” ”

“”Who said there wouldn’t be any benefits?”Cao Wei continued, “Ever since half a month was lost, grandfather Ye has not been able to recover from his illness. Aunty Lang’s hair turned white overnight. Ye group lost two pillars overnight. Xi Muwen single-handedly took the lead and in less than a year, he changed the name of Ye Group! “If nothing happened to Xiao Banyue, with grandfather Ye’s methods, would he let Xi Muwen succeed?” ”

“Not only did grandfather ye disagree, he couldn’t even get past Aunt Lang. ”

“Because XI Muwen knew that Xiao Banyue was grandfather Ye and Aunt Lang’s weakness, that was why he targeted Xiao Banyue. ”

Even if Xiao Banyue was his biological daughter.

“When she heard this, the young woman narrowed her eyes. “If that’s the case, Xi Muwen is indeed very suspicious! Did you tell Aunt Lang about this?” ”

Xi Muwen shook his head. “Xi Muwen’s hands and feet are too clean. I haven’t found any evidence to prove that these things were done by him yet.”

The young woman frowned. “Then what do we do now?”

Cao Wei picked up the phone on the table. “I’ll get someone to investigate this fake little half a month.”

Knowing oneself and the enemy was the key to victory. Only by thoroughly understanding what Xi Muwen wanted to do could auntie lang trust him.

“MMM.”

“Cao Wei continued, “Jiayi, go back when you have time. Tell elder Wang not to worry. I’ll definitely bring Auntie Lang back.” ” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Okay.”Xue Jia Yi nodded. “I’ll go back tomorrow.”

On the other side.

“After Auntie Lang hung up, she returned to the living room. ”

“Xi Muwen walked up and said, “Lang Hua, if you’re busy, go ahead! I’ll take care of Little Half Moon here.” ”

“Yang jiao smiled and said, “Muwen is right, sister. If you’re busy, go ahead. Don’t worry, I’ll definitely take care of Little Half Moon as my own daughter.” ”

“”I’m not busy.”Aunt Lang shook her head. She wanted to walk to Little Half Moon’s side, but before she could get close, Little Half Moon was so scared that she hid behind Yang Jiao. ”

It was obvious that Little Half Moon had already regarded Yang Jiao as the person she trusted the most.

“Seeing that her daughter trusted others so much but avoided her, it would be a lie to say that she was not sad. ”

Aunt Lang was very upset now.

“Yang Jiao looked at Little Half Moon and said with a smile, “Look at you, she’s your mother! Don’t be afraid, your mother loves you the most in this world!” ”

“Bad Person!”

Aunt Lang sighed.

...

On the other side.

“A handsome jaguar stopped in front of the Cen family’s experimental base. Then, a tall figure leaned out of the car. His clean and fair hand rested on the black car door, making his already cold and white skin look white, at this moment, his skin was as white as jade. Looking up from this hand, one could see a cold and stern profile. ”

“His thin lips were tightly pursed, and his well-defined facial features seemed to be covered in an impenetrable layer of ice. ”

“After getting out of the car, he went around to the other side and pulled open the door of the passenger seat. ”

The ice and snow on his face began to melt.

Everything was restored.

“He extended his right hand to the person in the car, and red beads and tassels flowed out from between his fingers. “We’re here.” ”

“A slender, jade-like hand rested on his hand. Then, a slender figure leaned out of the car. “You’re here so quickly?” ”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing held her hand tightly. The two of them turned around and walked into the base’s main entrance.

In the base’s laboratory.

“When he learned that ye Zhuo was coming with Cen Shaoqing, Cen Jiang was extremely excited. “I heard that Miss Ye will be coming today. Is that true?” ”
