Translator: 549690339

“”No, I’m too full. Let me take a nap.”Actually, under normal circumstances, ye Zao would only eat until she was 80% full. ”

“However, she could not take it anymore. There were always people at the dining table serving her food. With dessert and other things, she was a little full. ”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing held the Buddha beads in one hand and the steering wheel in the other. “Let’s take a walk around the square now.”

“At this moment, a cell phone rang in the car. ”

Ye Zao fumbled to pick up the phone. “Hello.”

“He didn’t know what the other party said, but ye Zao said impatiently, “Let’s talk about it later.” ”

“I’m not free.”

“The next second, Ye Zao suddenly sat up straight. His eyes seemed to be filled with starlight. “Really?” ”

“What time is it the day after tomorrow?”

“Okay.”

“After hanging up the phone, CEN Shaoqing asked curiously, “Who called?” ”

“ABA’s CEO.”

“Male or female?”Cen Shaoqing asked casually.

“Male.”Ye Zao’s eyes were indifferent.

“In the next second, a shadow was cast on ye Zao’s face. Cen Shaoqing leaned over and supported himself with one hand on the back of the chair behind ye Zao, while the other held a Buddhist bead. He just looked at Ye Zao. The two of them were very close to each other, the scent of sandalwood wafted onto her face. “Leader, aren’t you going to explain?” ”

“Using the most domineering manner, he said the most cowardly words. ”

“Ye Zao looked at Cen Shaoqing and felt like laughing. “The CEO invited me to be the assessment officer the day after tomorrow. I didn’t want to agree initially, but he said that he has the secret recipe of the Heart Candy Mu Xue.” ”

The Heart Candy Mu Xue was a very famous ancient European royal dessert.

“Unfortunately, this royal dessert was lost because of the secret recipe during the war. People had only heard of its delicacy, but no one had ever eaten it. ”

Cen Shaoqing lowered his eyes slightly and lightly pecked at this person’s jade-like lips. “Approved.”

“”Thank you for the approval, sir.”Ye Zhuo was very supportive. ”

Cen Shaoqing gently moved the corners of his mouth and turned to his red lips. The four lips intersected and were as cold as water. He attacked the city and seized the city. It was unknown who had lost their position first.

“After a moment, Cen Shaoqing finally let go of her. ”

His breathing was a little heavy.

“If he did not let go of her, Cen Shaoqing was worried that ye Zhuo would question him about why he put his phone on him again. ”

“When he got out of the car, Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips opened slightly. “I happen to be free the day after tomorrow. I’ll go with you.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and imitated him. “I’ll allow it.”

Cen Shaoqing cupped his hands. “Your humble subject thanks you.”

“Your humble subject is excused.”

Your humble subject...

Your humble subject!

Your humble subject!

“When he heard this, Cen Shaoqing’s ears turned slightly red. ”

“Listen to this, what kind of ‘Tiger and Wolf Words’was this ”

“From this term of endearment, one could tell how much ye Zhuo loved him. ”

“When he returned home, Cen Shai was a little elated. ”

“Once he reached home, Cen Shaoqing turned on the music, causing the music of the ‘Great Sorrow Mantra’to reverberate in every corner of the Cen Manor. ”

“CEN Yueya asked curiously, “Hasn’t Shaoqing not listened to the ‘Great Sorrow Mantra’for a long time? Why did he start listening again?” ”

“Old Madam Cen smiled and said, “Maybe he’s in a good mood! Maybe Yezi is pregnant! Holy shit! I’m going to be a great-grandmother! I’m going to have a great-grandson! Oh My God! Xiangxiang, Xiangxiang, you’re going to be a grandmother!”The more old Mrs. Cen said, the more excited she got, in the end, she stood up from her chair and walked upstairs. ”

“”Grandmother, what are you going to do?” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen said without turning her head, “I’m going upstairs to name my great-grandson!” ”

Cen Yueya shook her head speechlessly. “This old lady listens to the wind and the rain.”

Soon.

It was the day of the ABA and HI joint assessment.

“Zheng Wanyin still had to prepare to go on stage to participate in the assessment, so she came very early. ”

Time passed by minute by minute.

“When Zheng Wanyin was fully prepared and came to the assessment venue again, she actually saw an unexpected figure at the family seats. ”

“That, that was Cen Shaoqing! ”

Didn’t Cen Shaoqing say that he didn’t have time to come over?

Then why did he come?

Moreover.

There was no ye Zhuo by Cen Shaoqing’s side.

This meant that ye Zhuo didn’t know that Cen Shaoqing was here.

Could it be that he was here to cheer for her?

Yes.

Cen Shaoqing must have come because of her.

The man really didn’t mean what he said.

“Cen Shaoqing clearly said that he didn’t have time, but he still came. ”

This meant that she had a certain status in Cen Shaoqing’s heart.

“For a moment, Zheng Wanyin’s heart was beating a little fast. ”

“But the next second, Zheng Wanyin saw a figure that she did not want to see at the entrance. ”

It was ye Zhuo.

Why was Ye Zhuo here?

Could it be that he was chasing after Cen Shaoqing?

Wasn’t he chasing too closely?

Did he not know that he had to give the man some freedom?

“Cen Shaoqing had just sat down when ye Zhuo caught up with him. If she was Cen Shaoqing, she definitely wouldn’t be able to take it. ”

Ye Zhuo walked in and found a seat to sit down.

“Seeing this scene, Zheng Wanyin’s eyes widened in disbelief. ”

That was the position of the examiner!

Didn’t you see the examiner’s nameplate on the table?

“However, the nameplate was written in Hindi and not Chinese. It was normal for ye Zao to make a mistake. ”

One had to know that Hindi was one of the top ten difficult languages in the world.

“Zheng Wanyin tidied her clothes and intentionally walked past Cen Shaoqing. She walked over to ye Zao and said, “Cousin-in-law, you’re sitting in the wrong place. This is the assessment officer’s position. The family seat is over there!” ”
