“At this point, a bitter smile appeared on the corner of Song Chenyu’s mouth. “Forget about me, I’m afraid that the entire blue team combined can’t even compare to miss ye.” ”

“Hearing this, song Yiwan raised her head to look. ”

Song Chenyu was right.

“Right now, the center of the program team was at Ye Zhuo and the red team’s place. The cameras were focused on Ye Zhuo, and they did not even give the red team a shot. ”

“As long as ye Zao was there, no one else could stand out. ”

Song Yiwan was still a small flower with a lot of traffic. The reason why she came to “Country”was because of the popularity of “Country”.

“Now, all the shots of “Country”were with Ye Zao, and she was crushed by an internet celebrity. What was this? ”

“”Director, this is too unfair!”Song Yiwan frowned. “Which one of us is worse than ye Zao? Why doesn’t he give us a shot?” ”

“Forget it.”Song Chenyu patted song Yiwan’s hand. “Who asked Miss Ye to be so capable? !”

“Song Chenyu could tolerate it and let it go, but song Yiwan couldn’t. ”

“She had been in the entertainment industry for so long, but she had never been bullied by anyone. ”

“Now, she was crushed by an internet celebrity on the show. ”

Why did ye Zhuo deserve it?

“Song Chenyu turned to look at song Yiwan, “Yiwan, don’t think too much. Actually, it’s not a bad thing for Miss Ye to be popular. If she’s popular, it means that our show is popular again. When that time comes, we can also bask in the glory, right?” ”

BASK in the glory?

Song Yiwan felt very uncomfortable when she heard this.

Was it her turn to bask in the glory of an Internet celebrity now?

“Song Yiwan looked at Ye Zao’s back in front of her, and a faint light flashed in her eyes. ”

“Song Chenyu’s gaze swept across song Yiwan’s face, and the corners of his mouth curled up slightly. ”

The filming continued.

“Song Chenyu’s gaze caught the camera moving over. He held song Yiwan’s arm and said, “Yiwan, are you tired?” ”

“Song Yiwan was about to say something, but song Chenyu used his eyes to signal for song Yiwan to move the camera over. Song Yiwan immediately understood and smiled. “I’m not tired, Chenyu. Are You Tired?” ”

“I’m alright. I’m not very tired.”

“Soon, they reached the top of the mountain. ”

The area at the top of the mountain was very wide.

“They did not know where the program team had hidden the item, so they split up to look for it. ”

“Actually, the program team had left some clues. As long as one was good at observation, they would be able to find clues. Ye Zhuo followed the clues to the west side of the mountain. ”

“Song Chenyu narrowed his eyes and immediately went up. “Ye, Wait for me.” ”

Ye Zao looked back slightly and saw song Chenyu running over. He smiled and looked back. “Chenyu.”

“Although ye Zao did not like song Chenyu very much, this was a show after all. Everyone called each other by their names. If she said something like miss song, it would definitely cause a heated discussion. ”

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “Yezi, where do you think the program team would hide the things?” ”

“”It’s probably around here,”ye Zao said faintly. ”

“Song Chenyu continued, “Then let’s work together?” ”

Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly.

Work Together?

That was strange.

“Although song Chenyu had never said it, she could see from his eyes that song Chenyu had a deep hostility toward her. ”

There must be something fishy going on.

“Ye Zao subconsciously touched the second button on his shirt and said with a smile, “Chenyu, what did you say just now?” ” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Song Chenyu was stunned.

Why did ye Zao ask again?

Did he not hear it clearly just now?

“But she did not think too much about it and continued, “Let’s work together to find the treasure box? We can share the clues we find with each other.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded.

“Then let’s go.”

Ye Zao followed song Chenyu’s footsteps.

The two of them chatted as they walked.

Song Chenyu glanced at ye Zao out of the corner of her eyes. Her eyes were full of sarcasm.

“She had thought that ye Zao was very smart, but it turned out that he was just so-so. ”

Song Chenyu narrowed her eyes.

She was waiting for an opportunity.

She was waiting for another opportunity that could make ye Zao become the black sheep of the internet.

“The camera crew was behind them. Today, the camera crew did not bring a drone with them to shoot. Song Chenyu narrowed her eyes. She had been filming for many years, so she could accurately calculate the angle of the camera. ”

“Behind her was a ravine. If she fell now, the camera would not be able to capture the entire process. ”

“Three, two, one. ”

Now!

Song Chenyu slipped and fell into the ravine. “Ah!”

This sudden scene stunned the camera crew.

The director thought that song Chenyu was joking with Ye Zao.

“Song Chenyu was a top-rated female celebrity. Because of the first episode’s broadcast, Ye Zao had also become popular. With the two of them together, even if they did not do anything, that was the topic of conversation. ”
