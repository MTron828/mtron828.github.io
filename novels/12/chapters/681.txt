“If song Chenyu was CEN fifth master’s girlfriend, according to Cen Yuyan’s personality, she would definitely introduce song Chenyu directly in front of everyone! ”

“After all, Cen Yuyan had always been proud of Song Chenyu. ”

“Liu Xiaoyu had already been unhappy with song Chenyu for a long time. When she learned that song Chenyu was not Cen Shaoqing’s girlfriend, she was especially happy, she smiled and said, “Sister Yuyan, can you tell us who fifth Master’s girlfriend is?” ”

“Cen Yuyan was about to say something when Song Chenyu patted song Chenyu’s hand. He raised his head to look at Liu Xiaoyu and said softly, “If Miss Liu has any questions, just ask me. Coincidentally, Miss Ye and I are in the same industry.” ”

The same industry?

“Song Chenyu’s words were like throwing a bomb into deep water. Someone immediately asked, “Fifth Master’s girlfriend is also a Celebrity?” ”

“Song Chenyu continued, “Miss Ye is an online streamer.” ”

An online streamer?

The kind that would squirm in front of a bunch of old men?

This was even worse than being a celebrity!

Who would have thought that CEN fifth master’s girlfriend was actually a streamer?

“Hearing this, the people in the room could not help but sigh. ”

“Although they had not seen Cen Wuye’s girlfriend yet, everyone could already imagine what his girlfriend looked like. ”

She was definitely a common internet celebrity.

“Her eyelids were cut exaggeratedly, her face was awry, and her nose bridge was covered by a prosthesis... ”

“”Miss Song, can you tell us the live streamer number of CEN Wuye’s girlfriend?” ”

“Song Chenyu shook her head and said gently, “It involves personal privacy. I’m afraid it’s not convenient to reveal this.” ”

“Since song Chenyu had already rejected it, it was not good for everyone to insist. ”

“”Mr. Lu, May I add you on wechat?”At this moment, Liu Xiaoyu walked in front of Lu Xiu. ”

“Lu Xiu was young and promising. He was also a single noble, so he was very welcome in the circle, especially young girls. ”

“Seeing this scene, Cen Yuyan’s lips curled up into a mocking smile. ”

Lu Xiu had a strange temper. He never casually added girls’wechat.

Even she only added Lu Xiu’s wechat because of her relationship with song Chenyu.

Lu Xiu acted as if he didn’t care about anyone except for Song Chenyu.

“As expected, in the next second, Lu Xiu rejected him. “Sorry, I don’t have wechat.” ”

No wechat?

Who wouldn’t have wechat nowadays?

It was obvious that he didn’t want to add her.

An awkward expression flashed across Liu Xiaoyu’s face.

Cen Yuyan snorted lightly.

“Song Chenyu stood up and said, “Brother Lu, sister Yuyan accidentally deleted an important piece of information from her phone a few days ago. Can you help her retrieve it?” ”

“Lu Xiu looked up at song Chenyu and said in a good-natured manner, “Bring it over for me to take a look.” ”

“Cen Yuyan was overjoyed. She immediately took out her phone and handed it to Lu Xiu. “Sorry to trouble you, Mr. Lu.” ”

“No problem.”Lu Xiu took the phone.

“Cen Yuyan sat back down beside song Chenyu. She pinched song Chenyu’s hand and said in a low voice, “Chenyu, thank you.” ”

“It’s my pleasure.”

...

“At this moment, Cen Shaoqing’s car stopped downstairs. ”

“He ziteng had been waiting for a long time on the first floor. When he saw Cen Shaoqing’s car, he was so excited that he immediately went up to greet him. “Fifth brother, female, God!” ”

Ye Zao was about to push the door open and get out of the car when Cen Shaoqing’s hand came around her shoulder. “Wait.”

“What’s Wrong?”Ye Zao looked back slightly.

Cen Shaoqing reached out and stroked her hair. “Let me help you tie up your hair.” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Maybe it was because of his possessiveness, Cen Shaoqing did not want other men to see ye Zao with his hair down. ”

“Therefore, ever since he confirmed his relationship with Ye Zao, Cen Shaoqing always had a black rubber band on his wrist in addition to the Buddhist beads in his hand. ”

“Okay.”Ye Zao sat up straight and let Cen Shaoqing tie her hair.

“Cen Shaoqing’s movements were very light, afraid that she would hurt herself if she was not careful. ”

“After a while, her hair was tied up and the two of them got out of the car. ”

“He ziteng saw that the two of them had been struggling for a long time before they came out. He looked at the two of them with malicious intentions. “Fifth brother, Guru, the two of you didn’t come out of the car for a long time just now. What bad things were you doing?” ”

Ye Zhuo’s inexplicable old face turned red.

Cen Shaoqing raised his hand and slapped he ziteng. “What kind of colorful things are you thinking about?”

TSK TSK TSK.

“CEN fifth master, who had always been pure and ascetic, now even knew about the colors. ”

“He ziteng raised his head and glanced at CEN Shaoqing. He suppressed the smile in his eyes. “Fifth brother, I’m joking with you! Come, Let’s quickly enter the house!” ”

The three of them walked into the villa.

“In the sunlight room, he ziteng brought Cen Shaoqing and ye Zao in. ”

“”Let me introduce to you all. This is fifth master’s girlfriend and my idol, Miss Ye!” ”

“Hearing this, everyone looked up. ”

“The girl was about 1.7 meters tall. She stood there like this. Her porcelain-white face seemed to be covered in a layer of snow. It was bright and beautiful with a hint of clarity, mixed with a hint of uneasiness. ”

She was wearing a beige coat and a pair of Martin boots. She looked extremely handsome!

She was very beautiful.

She was also very gorgeous.

“However, her body was still emitting a biting cold. ”

She was too beautiful!

It was a pity.

She was so beautiful that she was actually an internet celebrity.

What was the difference between this and a vase?

“Although song Chenyu was not as beautiful as ye Zao, she was at least more capable than ye Zao. ”

“At this moment, Lu Xiu, who was sitting opposite Cen Yuyan, suddenly stood up and looked at ye Zao. He almost cried out in surprise, “Dad, Dad?” ”
