“”Zeng Rou! Are you crazy! Do you know what my cousin-in-law’s status is? It’s your turn to gossip!”Zhao duoduo slammed the table and stood up, she angrily said, “She’s the daughter of the Lin Corporation! Indeed, she’s something that can’t be put on the table! She can say anything! Little Aunt, is this your good cousin from your own family?” ”

“This disgrace did not only refer to Zeng Rou, but also indirectly slapped Zeng Qiuwen in the face. ”

“After all, Zeng Rou was Zeng Qiuwen’s cousin. ”

It was a matter of life and death.

Zeng Qiuwen’s expression was very ugly. She knew that Zeng Rou would definitely embarrass her.

This useless thing!

Zeng Rou was stunned!

“Just now, Zhao duoduo said who was ye Zhuo? ”

The daughter of the Lin Corporation?

How could ye Zao be the daughter of the Lin Corporation?

No.

It couldn’t be.

PA!

“Without saying anything else, Zeng Qiuwen directly slapped Zeng Rou. “Idiot! Hurry up and apologize to Miss Ye!” ”

“”SIS, you...”Zeng Rou was about to explain when Zeng Qiuwen slapped Zeng Rou’s face again. “I asked you to apologize to Miss Ye. Are You Deaf?” ”

Ask her to apologize to ye Zao?

On what basis?

She was not wrong!

“But at that moment, other than apologizing to ye Zao, Zeng Rou had no other choice. ”

“Zeng Rou walked up to ye Zao and apologized with red eyes. “Zao, Zao Zao, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean what I said. Those who don’t know are innocent...” ”

“Zeng Qiuwen smiled apologetically. “Miss Ye, my cousin is still young. Please don’t take it to heart.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing looked up slightly. His deep eyes were filled with coldness. He pulled ye Zhuo’s hand and stood up from his seat. “Aunt, we’ll go back first!” ”

“After saying that, he turned around and left. ”

“Shaoqing!”Bai Shu immediately stood up as well.

Cen Shaoqing held ye Zhuo’s hand and left the Zhao family without looking back.

“Looking at Cen Shaoqing’s back, Bai Shu was so angry that her face turned pale. She clutched her chest and said, “Third brother, third brother! How can I Say Good Things to you! You’ll have to tear this family apart sooner or later!” ”

“If Zhao Jiadong had not provoked Zeng Qiuwen to come back, how could such a thing have happened tonight! ! ”

Zhao Jiadong felt a little wronged. The disaster was caused by Zeng Rou. What did it have to do with him? “Mom! Mom! Don’t worry! I’ll send Zeng Rou away immediately!”

“Zeng Qiuwen also quickly pleaded, “Mom, it’s all my fault. If you want to blame someone, blame me! From now on, I don’t have a sister like Zeng Rou anymore. Please Don’t blame Jiadong!” ”

“Not only had Zeng Rou received two slaps, but she was also being chased out by the Zhao family. ”

She had come to the Zhao family to look for the bachelor.

“Now, she had received nothing. ”

“Instead, she was left in a mess. ”

“How could she accept this? She immediately knelt down and tugged at the corner of Zeng Qiuwen’s clothes, saying, “Sister! Sister! You Can’t send me away! Sister! I know I’m wrong. I really know I’m wrong!” ”

A Fool is a fool!

Zeng Qiuwen’s face was full of anger.

Could Zeng Rou not see that Bai Shu was in charge of the Zhao family?

What was the use of begging her?

“Shut up!”Zeng Qiuwen looked at Zeng Rou.

Zeng Rou shut her mouth.

“A mistress is a mistress.”A cold female voice suddenly appeared in the air. “You’re still looking at the pot when you’re eating. This is great. Now You’ve lost everything.”

A mistress? DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

These were the words Zeng Qiuwen hated to hear the most right now.

She was a person who had accepted higher education.

She knew that it was immoral to interfere in other people’s marriages.

But she never thought that she had done anything immoral.

“After all, she was with Zhao Jiadong for love. ”

Love could not be controlled.

“Besides, Zhao Jiadong’s ex, du Yingying, had been with Zhao Jiadong for so long, but she still could not get pregnant. What right did a woman who could not get pregnant have to continue occupying Zhao Jiadong. ”

Therefore.

The immoral person should be du yingying.

“Du Yingying’s behavior, to put it bluntly, was to occupy the latrine and not take a dump. ”

But she was different.

“She could give birth to a son for Zhao Jiadong and carry on the family line for Zhao Jiadong. Therefore, Zeng Qiuwen never thought of herself as a mistress. Not only was she not a mistress, she should be the savior of the Zhao family and Zhao Jiadong. ”

But what about the people from the Zhao Family?

“It was fine if they did not know how to be grateful. Instead, they looked down on her and mocked her. ”

They simply did not know what was good for them.

“Zeng Qiuwen’s expression was a little ugly, but the person who came was Zhao Jiadong’s sister, Zhao youling. Zeng Qiuwen did not dare to say anything and could only pretend that she did not hear anything. ”

“”Sister! What nonsense are you talking about! Who is a mistress?”Zhao Jiadong raised his head and looked at Zhao youling. “Sister, your words are too harsh!” ”
