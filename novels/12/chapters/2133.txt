“”Auntie, are you okay?”Duanmu Feng asked. ”

“”I’m fine. You Don’t have to worry.”Duanmu Huang Fei continued, “Cen Haifeng doesn’t dare to touch me easily.” ”

“”Sister, what’s Going On?”Mrs. Duanmu asked. ”

“Duanmu Huang Fei said, “Cen Haifeng has regained his memory.” ”

“Mrs. Duanmu frowned slightly. “The, the forbidden technique has lost its effect?” ”

Duanmu shook her head. “I don’t know either.”

“”But even if he has regained his memory, he can’t Treat You Like This!”Mrs. Duanmu continued, “After all, you were married by him!” ”

“If she had to say that Duanmu was in the wrong, then she was in the wrong to be the daughter of the Duanmu family. ”

“After all, Duanmu Fengfei wasn’t the only one who deceived Cen Haifeng, but also the other members of the General Alliance. ”

The previous General Alliance had to come from Earth. It was the rule of the General Alliance to marry and have children on Earth!

Duanmu Fengfei was just a weak woman. What was wrong with her?

“Even if Duanmu Fengfei didn’t marry Cen Haifeng back then, there would still be a second and third person! ”

“”He found out about the people I sent to Earth.”Duanmu fengfei continued, “He wanted to cancel the engagement, but the political bureau refused, so he could only lock me in to vent his anger.” ”

The laws of the Allied countries clearly stated that any citizen was not allowed to harm the lives of the people on Earth. The highest penalty was hanging!

“Sister! Are you confused?”Mrs. Duanmu frowned. “How can you attack those people at such a critical time? !”

“I just can’t Take It!”Duanmu Huangfei was really indignant. “Why should I be the one in the wrong? What’s wrong with me?”

She only regretted not attacking earlier.

Mrs. Duanmu sighed.

That’s right.

It was the same in the past dynasties of the General Alliance.

What was wrong with Duanmu Huangfei?

“After a while, Mrs. Duanmu looked up at duanmu huangfei and said, “Sister, don’t be anxious. I’ll get someone to look for you. If it really doesn’t work out, I’ll ask brother-in-law for mercy. I’ll definitely think of a way to bail you out.” ”

“”No need.”Duanmu huangfei shook his head. “I want to calm down during this period of time. There’s no need for you to drag yourself down for me. Especially with Fengyu’s current position, it’s really not suitable for her to interfere in this matter!” ”

“Hearing this, Duanmu Fengyu immediately became anxious. “Aunt, are you going to let me watch you go to jail? I Can’t Do That!” ”

“”I’ve Been Afraid of everything all these years. I’ve been too tired after working so hard for your uncle. I also want to have a good rest. This is a rare opportunity,”Duanmu Fengyu said with a smile, then, she said, “I’ve tried everything in my life, but it’s the first time I’m going to jail.” ”

“Auntie!”

“Duanmu Fengyu waved her hand. “Let’s go back! Jingjing, take Fengyu back quickly.” ” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Mrs. Duanmu nodded and held Duanmu Fengyu’s hand as they walked back.

“Duanmu Fengyu turned around and looked at Mrs. Duanmu. “Mom, are we really going to leave Aunt Alone?” ”

“”Your aunt is right. After all, she has accompanied Cen Haifeng for twenty years. They are husband and wife. Cen Haifeng will not make things difficult for her.”Mrs. Duanmu paused, then, she said, “But you are different. You will marry Dongli in the future. If you spend too much time with your aunt at this time, it will definitely affect you.” ”

“Hearing this, Duanmu Fengyu frowned. ”

Duanmu Fengyu had always treated her as her biological daughter. She really couldn’t bear to see Duanmu Fengyu suffer like this.

“”Don’t worry. Your aunt will be fine.”Mrs. Duanmu patted Duanmu Fengyu’s hand. “At this time, you shouldn’t get involved in your aunt’s matters. It’s the best help for her.” ”

Duanmu fengyu nodded.

The mother and daughter arrived at the police station.

Duanmu Liangchen was already standing there waiting for them. The flashy aircraft and the young and beautiful Ning ‘er had also disappeared.

“Scenery.”Duanmu Liangchen jogged over. “What did sister say?”

Mrs. Duanmu relayed Duanmu Fengyu’s words to Duanmu Liangchen truthfully.

“Hearing this, Duanmu liangchen nodded and said, “Then let’s go back first.” ”

“Okay.”

“Where’s My Little Mother?”Duanmu Fengyu suddenly asked.

“Little Mother? What Little Mother?”Duanmu Liangchen asked curiously.

“Duanmu fengyu sneered, “You brought her to my mother to show off. Isn’t she my little mother?” ”

“”You Child, what nonsense are you talking about!”Duanmu Liangchen scolded. ”

“”The child is insensible. You Don’t have to be calculative with her,”Mrs. Duanmu said at this time, “Tell that person outside to be more careful in the future. She doesn’t find it disgusting, but I find it disgusting.” ”
