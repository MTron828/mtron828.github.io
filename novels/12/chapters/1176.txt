A good dessert?

“Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes. “Okay, I got it! Brother Si, when the matter is settled, I’ll treat you to a meal!” ”

“Okay.”Si lui nodded.

Ye Zhuo looked at the notice on the official website with a faint look in his eyes.

It seemed that Old Master Jin was right.

The lawyer was an infatuated child.

He would do anything for Zhao Xueyin.

“”President Ye.”At this moment, there was a knock on the door. ”

“Come in.”Ye Zhuo looked up slightly.

“Milai pushed the door open and came in. “President Ye, Mr. Jiang is looking for you.” ”

Ye Zhuo stood up from the boss’s chair. “Uncle Jiang.”

“Jiang Chao walked in from outside and didn’t bother to say anything else. He went straight to the point. “President Ye, half of the old shareholders have left. What should we do next?”Jiang Chao was really a little worried, the Jiang Financial Group itself was already on the verge of collapse. ”

“Now that more than half of the shareholders had left, if ye Zhuo still didn’t take any measures, it would really be over! ”

“There’s no rush.”Ye Zhuo asked Millet to pour a glass of water for Jiang Chao. “The time isn’t ripe yet.”

It was already on the verge of collapse!

There was no rush?

“Jiang Chao said, “President Ye, are you sure there’s no rush?” ”

Ye Zhuo bent down slightly and reached out to press the Enter key on the computer keyboard. “I’m sure.”

“Jiang Chao scratched his head. He had a bellyful of things to say, but he didn’t know how to say them. ”

“At this point, he didn’t know whether it was right or wrong to hand over the Jiang Financial Group to Ye Zhuo. ”

“After a moment, Jiang Chao continued, “Miss Ye, then how much longer do we have to wait?” ”

“”Tomorrow Morning.”Ye Zhuo raised his eyes slightly, his tone clear and shallow. ”

“Tomorrow Morning?”Jiang Chao’s face was filled with doubt.

“En.”Ye Zhuo nodded.

“Since ye Zhuo had already said that he would wait until tomorrow morning, then he would wait another day! ” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Jiang Chao stood up and said, “President Ye, then I’ll be leaving First!” ”

“En.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

What happened here was reported to Annie word for word by millet.

Annie immediately reported this matter to Zhao Xueyin.

“Hearing this, Zhao Xueyin’s face was full of ridicule. ”

Tomorrow Morning?

“In just one night, what did ye Zhuo want to change? ”

Did she really think she was a god?

She wanted to see what would happen to the Jiang Financial Group Tomorrow Morning!

“In the blink of an eye, the next day arrived. ”

8:30 pm.

Zhao Xueyin arrived at the Shunxi Financial Group.

“When she felt the entrance, she realized that there was a large group of financial reporters gathered at the entrance of the Shunxi Financial Group. ”

Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes.

What was going on?

Why were there so many reporters gathered at the entrance of the Financial Group for no reason?

Zhao Xueyin took out her cell phone and called Annie.

Annie had already come to work. “I’m not too sure either. I heard that it’s because of the matter with the Jiang Financial Group!”

Jiang Financial Group?

“Could it be that the Jiang Financial Group had already declared bankruptcy, and that was why these reporters were rushing to interview ye Zhuo? ”

Yes!

That must be the case.

“Otherwise, these reporters wouldn’t have gathered at the entrance of the Jiang Financial Group. ”

“Ye Zhuo was Old Ye’s descendant. With such a gimmick, she was actually unable to help the Jiang Financial Group out of their predicament. wasn’t this a huge joke? ”

It seemed that it was time for her to turn the tide!

“The more Zhao Xueyin thought about it, the more excited she became. Her heart was beating faster and faster. She straightened her back and walked step by step towards the front door of the financial group. ”

“When they saw Zhao Xueyin approaching, the reporters immediately swarmed over and surrounded Zhao Xueyin. “Are you the acting chief of the Shunxi Financial Group, Miss Zhao Xueyin?” ”

“It’s me.”Zhao Xueyin nodded generously.

“May I ask what you think about President Ye and the Jiang Financial Group?”The reporters immediately asked.

That’s right!

These reporters were really here for the Jiang Financial Group!

“Zhao Xueyin suppressed the excitement in her heart, but she didn’t show it on her face at all, she continued, “Actually, from the very beginning, I didn’t approve of President Ye’s plan. Although president ye is the descendant of Old Ye, she lacks some actual combat experience after all. Unfortunately, President Ye didn’t seem to listen to my words. I’m also very sorry that her willful actions caused such a result today!” ”

“Hearing this, the reporters’expressions were somewhat complicated. ”

“Right at this moment, Zhao Xueyin suddenly saw ye Zhuo walking over. ”

“She was wearing a black hoodie and was currently pulling the hat on the hoodie up to her head. After pulling the hat up, it immediately covered most of her face. ”

It looked like she wanted to avoid these reporters.

Ye Zao wanted to avoid them?

No Way!

She wanted to make ye Zao lose face in front of the entire financial world!

“”Look, president ye is Here!”Zhao Xueyin pointed at ye Zao and said. ”
