“The room was cold, making people afraid to look him in the eye. ”

“”Bang, Bang, Bang.” ”

“At this moment, there was a knock on the door. ”

“”Come in,”the man said in a low voice. ”

“He ziteng pushed the door open and entered, holding a document in his hand. “Fifth brother, can you give this land to me?” ”

“From the south of the city?”Cen Shaoqing asked without raising his head.

“Yes.”He ziteng nodded.

“Not from the south of the city.”Cen Shaoqing poured the water from the teapot into eight small cups. “Take the piece from the north.”

It was a very casual tone.

It was so casual that it was as simple as giving a piece of candy.

“Little did he know that the piece of land in the north was not just a piece of land, but also involved a nearly eight-figure order. ”

“He ziteng frowned slightly. “Why not the land in the south?”If he remembered correctly, the land in the north was much more valuable than the land in the south of the city. ” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“I have a use for the land in the south of the city.”Cen Shaoqing’s tone was indifferent. He picked up a cup of tea and handed it to he ziteng. “Try it and see how it tastes.”

He ziteng was stunned.

“For the first time in his life, he drank the tea Cen Shaoqing personally brewed. ”

He was flattered!

He ziteng wiped his hands on his clothes and took the cup handed to him by Cen Shaoqing solemnly. He took a sip of the tea.

“The taste was slightly bitter and sweet. It was mellow and smooth, and the fragrance of the tea permeated the air. ”

It was a very top-notch taste.

He ziteng narrowed his eyes. The things around Cen Shaoqing were indeed different from ordinary things.

“How is the taste?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“Very good!”He ziteng gave a thumbs up. “Even the white silver needles collected by our old man don’t have such a taste.”

Cen Shaoqing picked up the Buddha beads on the table. “The instrument is the father of tea. The main thing is that the tea set is good.”

Tea Set?

He ziteng looked at the tea set in his hand.

“Unlike the traditional purple clay pot, this was a set of jade green tea set. It felt fine and not greasy, warm and not cold. It was exquisite and elegant. It was the best tea set. ”

“Something from the Qing Dynasty?”He ziteng asked in surprise.

“Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Yes, your fifth sister-in-law has good taste, right?” ”

He ziteng was stunned. “What does this have to do with my fifth sister-in-law?”

“Cen Shaoqing picked up the cup and took a sip of tea. He said slowly, “This tea set was given to you by your fifth sister-in-law.” ”

“He ziteng, who had been fed dog food, was speechless. He smiled on the surface, but in his heart, he was F * cking mad. ”

It turned out that Cen Shaoqing just wanted to show off that this tea set was gifted by Ye Zhuo.

“If he had not seen it with his own eyes, he ziteng would never have believed that the person in front of him was Cen Wu, who claimed that he would never marry! ”

This person was about to become a wife-flaunting maniac and a love-flaunting maniac!

He ziteng silently covered his mouth and did not say a word.

“Cen Shaoqing glanced at him and said in a cold tone, “Why are you covering your mouth?” ”

“He ziteng whimpered, “I’m afraid I’ll bark.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing’s expression did not change. He said seriously, “You’re very talented in chasing girls. It’s only a matter of time before you become a bachelor.” ”

“Hearing that, he ziteng immediately regained his full confidence. “Talent is useless! The problem is that I’ve never met a girl who can move me!” ”

“You’ll meet her.”Cen Shaoqing patted he ziteng on the shoulder. “You won’t be a single dog for the rest of your life.”

“He ziteng felt that CEN Shaoqing’s gaze was meaningful, but he couldn’t figure out what was strange about it. ”

Could it be that he was thinking too much?

...

At the sanatorium.

Lin Jincheng had been thinking about those past events for the past few days.

But he couldn’t remember the person in his memory.

Could it be that that person was really Feng Qianhua?

Lin Jincheng felt very painful.

“”Jincheng.”At this moment, Old Lady Lin walked in from outside. ”

“Mom.”Lin Jincheng raised his head.

“Old Lady Lin sat on the chair and said earnestly, “Jincheng, you have been calm for so many days. Shouldn’t you give Qianhua an explanation?” ”

Lin Jin Cheng did not say anything.

“Jin Cheng!”Old Madam Lin’s voice became heavier.

“Lin Jin Cheng raised his head to look at Old Madam Lin. “Mom, is it really Qianhua? Is Ah Ze’s mother really Qianhua?” ”

“”Don’t you know in Your Heart?”Old Madam Lin stood up angrily, “Qianhua hid her identity by your side and took care of our family for so many years. Don’t you feel anything at all? How can you let Qianhua down by doing this! Are you still a man?” ”

“A misunderstanding has passed for so many years. Can’t you let it go?”

Lin Jincheng was silent and did not say anything.

“The diary mentioned the misunderstanding, but Lin Jincheng could not bring it into his memory. ”
