Translator: 549690339

“”I’m very sorry to disappoint you, second Miss Cen. Zhou Rui and I are very happy now, and we will be very happy in the future!”Cen Yuyan smiled when she said this, “Oh, I forgot. Second Miss Cen, you are a pitiful person who has never been happy. How can a pitiful person understand the happiness of others?” ”

“Cen Yueya frowned. “Cen Yuyan, I’m talking to you properly. Is there a need to be so weird?” ”

“Cen Yuyan Sized Cen Yueya up and down, “Cen Yueya, are you especially jealous of me because you see that I’m living such a happy life? Jealous that I’ve found a good husband, jealous that I’m about to have my own flesh and blood? “Unlike some people who can’t even have their own flesh and blood!” ”

“Cen Yueya’s husband was unable to give birth, and Cen Yueya’s two children were IVF babies. ”

“However, this matter was a secret in the circle. ”

“Other than the CEN family, almost no one knew. ”

“Cen Yueya’s face turned pale in an instant. “If you have the ability, don’t cry in front of me in the future!” ”

“Who knows who will cry in front of whom!”Cen Yuyan pursed her lips.

Cen Yueya took a deep breath and walked to ye Zao’s side. “I’m so angry! I’m so angry! That fourth girl is simply infuriating me to death!”

“Ye Zao comforted her. “Don’t be angry, fourth sister. Anger is not good for the heart, liver, spleen, and lungs.” ”

“Cen Yueya raised her head and looked at ye Zao. “Zao Zao Zao, I know you have great ability. Do you have any way to let the fourth girl see Zhou Rui’s face!”She could not wait to see Cen Yuyan’s regretful look. ”

Ye Zao took out his phone from his pocket. “Let me take a look.”

Cen Yueya saw a string of code changing on the phone screen.

The speed was very fast and it was too much for her to take in.

“Cen Yueya was clearly a computer expert, but now, she could not understand a single word. ”

“Five minutes later, ye Zao sent Cen Yueya a file. “This is Zhou Rui’s schedule for the next few days.” ”

Cen Yueya opened it and frowned. “This gigolo’s nightlife is very rich!”

“In fact, the CEN sisters had also asked someone to investigate Zhou Rui’s background, but Zhou Rui’s hands and feet were too clean. They could not find anything useful. ”

Zhou Rui had recently dared to indulge himself like this because Cen Yuyan had completely lost her value in his eyes. That was why he dared to steal her openly.

“Ye Zhuo put away his phone and continued, “Also, there’s something very strange.” ”

“What is it?”Cen Yueya asked.

“Ye Zhuo said, “Zhou Rui and song Chenyu have been in contact very frequently. These two should have known each other a long time ago.” ”

“Cen Yueya frowned. “In other words, all of this is a trap?” ”

A trap that invited him into the trap.

“It’s very possible.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

Cen Yueya narrowed her eyes and had a plan in her heart.

At night.

Cen Yuyan received two anonymous emails. She opened them and saw that they were full of photos of Zhou Rui fooling around with other women. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

It was colorful.

Cen Yuyan trusted Zhou Rui very much. She did not believe that these photos were real at all.

“With the current high-tech development, they were definitely synthetic. ”

She did not even need to think to know that this was definitely done by the CEN family.

Their goal was to sow discord!

“However, the address at the bottom of the email made Cen Yuyan squint her eyes. ”

This was song Chenyu’s home address.

8:30 pm.

“Cen Yuyan looked at the time on the right side of her computer. It was seven o’clock, and there was still an hour and a half before 8:30 pm. ”

“This place was not far from song Chenyu’s house, and it was only half an hour’s walk. ”

Cen Yuyan had the key to Song Chenyu’s house.

“Although she felt that these things were made out of thin air, CEN Yuyan still decided to go to Song Chenyu’s house to take a look. ”

“When Cen Yuyan arrived, song Chenyu’s house was empty. ”

“An hour later, the sound of the door opening and conversation came from outside. ”

“Recalling the words on the email, CEN Yuyan immediately found a place to hide. ”

“As the footsteps got closer and closer, the voice also got closer and closer. ”

“”I don’t have ten million now, at most two million.” ”

This was song Chenyu’s voice.

“”Two million? Are you trying to send a beggar away? ! Song Chenyu, I trusted you so much, but you treated me as a fool! You said that after Cen Yuyan and I received the marriage certificate, we could officially become the CEN family’s son-in-law. What about now? The CEN family has already completely forgotten that Old Woman!” ”

“Cen Yuyan, who was hiding in the closet, covered her mouth tightly, not allowing herself to make any noise. ”

“This, this is Zhou Rui’s voice? ”
