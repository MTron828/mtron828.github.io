Zhao Xueyin turned to look at Father Zhao.

Father Zhao still shook his head.

“Zhao Xueyin had an idea. “Uncle Han, why don’t you look elsewhere? Even though an Gong’s bezoar pill is very precious, it’s not the only one in the entire capital.” ”

“If he could find it elsewhere, Han Laoshan would not have begged Zhao Xueyin so much. ”

Father Zhao had only dared to ask Zhao Xueyin to say that because he was certain that there would not be a second bezoar pill in the entire capital.

“Upon hearing this, Han Luoshan sighed on the other end of the phone. “Xueyin, can we really not discuss this further?” ”

“”Uncle Han, I’m sorry.” ”

“Han Luoshan also knew that there was no point in saying anything more. He continued, “Alright, that’s all for now. I Won’t disturb you anymore.” ”

“”Goodbye, Uncle Han.” ”

“After hanging up the phone, Zhao Xueyin looked up at Father Zhao. “Dad, aren’t you afraid that Han Luoshan will really find the second bezoar pill?” ”

“Once Han Luoshan found the second bezoar pill, they would be finished. ”

They might as well give the bezoar pill to Han Luoshan now.

“The corners of Father Zhao’s mouth curled up into a smile. “Bezoar pills can be used to save one’s life at critical moments. If Han Luoshan really could find the second bezoar pill, he wouldn’t have to wait until now.” ”

“If Zhao Xueyin had not encountered a problem during the election campaign, Father Zhao would not have been willing to take out the only bezoar pill. ”

“God knows how happy he was when he found out that Han Laoshan’s son, Han Dongliang, was terminally ill. ”

So what if Han Laoshan had a son?

He would still have to give up his life!

Zhao Xueyin nodded.

“As soon as Han Laoshan hung up the phone, Mrs. Han walked over and asked, “How was it? What did Zhao Xueyin Say?” ”

Han Laoshan shook his head.

“Seeing this, Mrs. Han’s face was full of sorrow. “Why don’t you beg her again?” ”

“”It’s useless.”Han Laoshan continued, “The one who makes the decisions is Zhao zhenfei. Zhao Xueyin is just a messenger.” ”

Zhao Zhenfei was a cunning old fox. He hated families with men the most.

It was difficult to get Zhao Zhenfei to let go!

Mrs. Han wiped away her tears. “Then what should we do now? We can’t just watch as Dongliang gets worse day by day!”

It was said that children were the mother’s fate.

“Ever since Han Dongliang was sick, Mrs. Han had almost cried her eyes out. ”

“In less than three months, her hair had turned completely white. Her face, which had been carefully maintained, was covered in wrinkles. ”

He looked more than 20 years older than before.

Han Laoshan pinched his temples.

He did not want to see his son’s condition worsen.

“”Let’s Wait a little longer,”Han Laoshan continued, “When the election is over, our Dongliang will be saved.” ”

“Mrs. Han’s eyes were red, and she could not stop her tears. “How can the Zhao family be like this! You have agreed to their conditions, so why can’t they give us the Bezoar Pill!” ”

“”Sir, Madam, young master is here.”At this moment, a servant came in and said. ”

Mrs. Han immediately wiped her tears. “Who did you say is here?”

“Young master Yi Tao.”

“Han Laoshan immediately said, “Quick, go and invite him in.” ”

The servant walked out.

“Not long after, he brought Yi Tao in. ”

Chen Qiaoye accompanied Yi Tao.

“”Uncle, aunt.” ”

“”Tao Tao, Qiaoye.”Mrs. Han immediately went up to greet him. ”

“Yi Tao continued, “Aunt, I heard that cousin is sick?” ”

“Yes.”Mrs. Han nodded.

“”How’s the situation?”Yi Tao hurriedly asked, “Are you feeling better now?” ”

Mrs. Han sighed. “The situation is very bad.”

“Upon hearing this, Yi Tao’s heart began to Clench. ”

“He was also a person who had suffered from a serious illness. He knew that when a child was sick, the person who suffered the most would always be the parents. ”

“Where is cousin now?”

“In the sterile room. Come with me.”

“In order to prevent Han Dongliang from living alone in the cold hospital, the Han family had specially built a sterile room at home. ”

Yi Tao and Chen Qiaoye followed Mrs. Han’s footsteps.

“To go to the sterile room, one had to change into a professional sterile suit. ”

“After changing into the sterile suit and putting on a mask, one could enter the sterile room. ”

“Fifteen minutes later, the few of them arrived at the sterile room. ”

“In the sterile room, the doctor was examining Han Dongliang’s body. ”

“When he saw Mrs. Han coming over, he immediately greeted her. ”

Mrs. Han nodded. “You can go out first.”

The Doctor walked out.

“Mrs. Han walked to the front of the bed, half-squatted down, and held Han Dongliang’s hand tightly. “Dongliang, your cousin Tao Tao and his sister-in-law have come to see you. Open your eyes and see if they are alright.” ”
