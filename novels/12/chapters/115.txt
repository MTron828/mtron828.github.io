Chapter 116: 078: an unknown past! Brother Ze, your birth mother might be in Yun Jing! 2

Beauty is used to look at.

Medical skills are used to save people.

Comparing the two, medical skills are more important.

Grandfather Yang frowned. “The Little Miracle Doctor Ye I’m Looking for isn’t her!”

The smile on Mu Yourong’s face froze at the corner of her mouth.

If Little Miracle Doctor Ye isn’t her, then who else could it be?

Besides her, who else could have the ability to resurrect the dead!

Was Old Master Yang muddle-headed? He actually didn’t even recognize his savior.

“Old Master Yang,”mu yourong continued, “Have you forgotten? I am the Divine Doctor Hua Tuo’s successor. It was my ancestral spirit medicine that cured your illness.”

If it wasn’t for her, Old Master Yang would have died long ago!

This damned old man was so good!

It was fine if he did not know how to be grateful, but he had actually forgotten about her, his life-saving benefactor.

Mu Yourong’s heart was filled with a mouthful of blood. She was almost disgusted to death by Old Master Yang.

His life-saving grace was greater than the heavens!

This old man had actually forgotten about her.

Old Master Yang repeatedly waved his hand. “I remember you. Your surname is mu, but I did not eat the three nil pill that you gave me! My illness was cured by Little Divine Doctor Ye!”

After saying this, old master yang ignored mu Yourong’s expression and turned to look at song Shiyu.

“Shiyu! I’m Looking for Little Divine Doctor Ye! Little Divine Doctor Ye is a very good-looking young lady! She’s about this tall and a little shorter than you. Her skin is even whiter than yours when it reaches your shoulders!”

Old Master Yang recalled ye Zhuo’s appearance as he described it to song Shiyu.

Mu Yourong did not know what to say.

She was clearly the one who had cured old master yang, but Old Master Yang refused to admit it. He even had to acknowledge someone else as his savior.

Who could bear this?

“Old Master Yang, the person you’re looking for is really me!”Mu Yourong suppressed the anger in her heart.

“Although I’m old, I’m not old enough to see things!”Old Master Yang said very impolitely, “Fu Nian! Return this Miss Ye’s Pill to her!”

Sun Fu Nian hurriedly ran out of the room with a small wooden box in his hand. He opened the lid and said, “Miss Mu, this medicine has always been in your care. Now, it’s returned to its rightful owner.”

Mu Yourong was stunned.

This was her medicine, and she would not mistake it for something that was taken out of the system.

Old Master Yang actually did not take her medicine.

What was going on?

If Old Master Yang had not taken her medicine, then who had cured old master yang?

Who had snatched away her credit?

Mu Yourong held the medicine box and stood rooted to the spot. Her face was deathly pale, and her back was sweating profusely.

She had thought that she was the one who had cured old master yang.

She had never thought that it was just a blunder.

When she thought about how she had just confidently said that she was old master Yang’s Savior, Mu Yourong was so embarrassed that she wished she could find a hole to hide in.

What should she do now?

Old Master Yang ignored Mu Yourong and looked at song Shiyu. “Shiyu, where is Little Divine Doctor Ye? Bring me to the front hall personally!”

“There are many people in the front hall, so please wait here for a while, Old Master Yang.”After saying this, song Shiyu quickly walked towards the front hall.

Ye Zhuo was eating the fourth piece of cake.

She was eating very seriously.

It was just a piece of cake, but she felt that it was a delicacy.

What people focused on was the most attractive.

It was no exception when they ate.

“Hello, Miss Ye. My Name Is Qi bin. Can I make a friend?”

Ye Zhuo had just finished eating the cake when a pleasant male voice sounded in her ear.

“Hello.”Ye Zhuo raised her eyes slightly, the color of the crystal light reflected in her eyes.

It was like a mysterious obsidian, shining brightly.

Qi bin was stunned for a moment. “Miss Ye, I heard that the scenery in the back garden of the song family is not bad. Why don’t we go out for a walk?”

Under the moonlight in front of a flower, there was a peerless beauty accompanying him.

Just thinking about it made him feel romantic.

Qi bin was a true playboy. He had four or five girlfriends and many other women who had sex with him, but now, Qi bin had a feeling that he would immediately sever all ties with those women, then he would pursue this girl in front of him.

The absurd idea of spending the rest of his life with her!

Nothing else. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

It was all because this girl was too tempting.

When he put the word “Pretty”together, he felt that the word “Pretty”was too pale.

“Thank you for your love, but I may not be lucky enough.”Ye Zhuo’s gaze passed Qi bin and landed in front of him, “I think Miss Wang, Miss Zhao, and Miss Sun over there are more interested in going to the back garden with you to enjoy the scenery.”
