“Old Mrs. Cen happened to be walking her dog back. When she saw ye Zao come down, she smiled and said, “Ye, are you done?” ”

“”Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly and walked over, stroking the beautiful dog’s head. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen looked upstairs and continued, “Where’s Shaoqing? Why didn’t he come down with us?” ”

“At the mention of Cen Shaoqing, Ye Zao’s ears were a little red. Fortunately, it was not very obvious. She continued, “He should still be busy.” ”

“”OH.”Old Mrs. Cen did not ask further. She picked up her phone and found a photo. “Zao Zao, look, this is the girlfriend I found for Big Beauty. What do you think?” ”

“In the photo, there was also a snow-white samoyed, but slightly thinner than big beauty. It was wearing a pink princess dress and a small crown. If it was a human, it would be a little princess. ”

“It’s pretty good.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “I think it’s pretty good too. “Now, I will take big beauty for a walk every morning and evening so that the two children can develop a relationship. I have already told the mother that no matter how many big beauty’s girlfriend carries in the future, she will give one to me.” ”

“After saying that, old Mrs. Cen looked at Big Beauty who was sitting on the ground and said, “Then we will go for sterilization.” ”

Sterilization?

Ye Zhuo did not expect that old Mrs. Cen would suddenly say such a thing.

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Before sterilization, give da Liang a child and be a real dog. It Won’t be a waste of da Liang’s dog life!” ”

Da Liang: the dog life was arranged clearly!

“Old Mrs. Cen could not help but exclaim, “I’m really the best grandmother in the universe, the best great grandmother in the Universe!” ”

“A moment later, Cen Shaoqing came down from upstairs. ”

“He was wearing a long, plain, moon-white robe. The retro-styled panties were meticulously tied to the top, revealing a sense of coolness amid his abstinence. ”

“Although it was still the same dress, Ye Zao still recognized that he had changed. ”

“Because of the previous dress, she had spilled some coffee on the cuffs. ”

There were still faint traces of coffee left.

But this dress had nothing.

Why did she change clothes in broad daylight?

The answer was very obvious!

“Subconsciously, ye Zao did not dare to look him in the eye. ”

“Cen Shaoqing was very calm. He walked in front of ye Zao and asked, “What do you want to eat for lunch?” ”

“”Anything,”ye Zao said. ”

“”Grandma, What About You?”Cen Shaoqing turned to look at Old Mrs. Cen. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen said, “I’m not a picky eater. I’ll eat whatever you guys eat.” ”

“”Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and continued, “By the way, do you still have the Chrysanthemum tea that you often drink?” ”

“Chrysanthemum tea not only had the effect of clearing away heat and removing fire, but it also had the effect of detoxifying poison. Therefore, Grandma Cen often drank chrysanthemum tea. ”

“However, Cen Shaoqing did not really like the taste of Chrysanthemum tea. ”

“Upon hearing this, Old Mrs. Cen asked curiously, “What do you want Chrysanthemum Tea For?” ”

“To drink.”Cen Shaoqing said concisely.

“Don’t you hate the taste of Chrysanthemum Tea?”Old Mrs. Cen asked.

“”Good medicine tastes bitter. In order to lower the fire, you have to endure even if it tastes terrible.”At this point, Cen Shaoqing turned to look at ye Zhuo and continued, “Leader, do you think I’m Right?” ”

“Ye Zao picked up the cup on the side and used the action of drinking water to hide the awkwardness on his face. “Yes, very right.” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen glanced at the two of them and said in puzzlement, “What’s wrong with the two of you? Why are you talking about riddles? It’s Strange!” ”

“I’ll go to the kitchen first.”Cen Shaoqing turned to go to the kitchen.

“The Cen family had a fixed menu every day, but since ye Zao was here today, he had to instruct the kitchen to make some of ye Zao’s favorite dishes. ”

“Although ye Zao said it was easy, Cen Shaoqing and ye Zao had been together for a long time, so he had already grasped ye Zao’s taste clearly. ”

“Sour, sweet, bitter, and spicy. These four tastes, other than ‘bitter’, ye Zao liked to eat everything. ”

“Among them, he liked desserts the most. ”

“As for the cuisine, she was more partial to Xiang cuisine. ”

“Cen Shaoqing came to the kitchen and asked the chef to make some of the dishes that ye Zao liked. Then, he went to the dessert room and asked the dessert chef to make more desserts. ”

Old Mrs. Cen and ye Zao sat in the living room in front of them and chatted. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“At this moment, a servant came in and said, “Old Mrs. Cen.” ”

“What’s Wrong?”Old Mrs. Cen looked up at the servant.

“”Old Mrs. Zuo and Mrs. Zuo are here to see you,”the servant said. ”

“”Please come in,”old Mrs. Cen said with a smile. ”

The servant turned around and went outside.

“Old Mrs. Cen looked at Ye Zao, “Yezi, you don’t have to be too restrained in a while. “They are not outsiders. When Old Mrs. Zuo was young, she and I were close sisters. Later, they went abroad and only returned recently. In a while, you can just follow behind me and call for help.” ”
