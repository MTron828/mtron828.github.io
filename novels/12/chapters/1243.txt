“Chapter 1244: 260: Zhao Xueyin’s face was disfigured, and the Zhao family was expelled from the financial world! 1”

What did he look like?

“At that time, before Zhao Xueyin and father Zhao could react, they were drenched in black dog’s blood. How could they have seen what that person looked like? ”

Father Zhao furrowed his brows tightly. “It’s broken? How could the surveillance cameras be broken?”

“The policeman standing in front said, “The surveillance cameras of your consortium are indeed broken, and they are currently under repair. “We’ve checked around the surroundings and didn’t find any trace of the relevant suspects, so we came to ask you and Miss Zhao if you saw the appearance of the perpetrator.” ”

Father Zhao’s expression was very ugly.

It was intentional.

This was intentional!

“Otherwise, the surveillance camera wouldn’t have broken at this time! ”

“”Mr. Zhao,”seeing that Father Zhao hadn’t spoken, the policeman standing in front continued, “Did you see it?” ”

“No...”

“Just as father Zhao said “No,”Zhao Xueyin’s voice sounded in the air, “I saw it!” ”

“Xueyin?”Father Zhao looked at Zhao Xueyin.

“Zhao Xueyin continued, “Officer, I saw it!” ”

“Who is it?”The police officer asked.

“”It’s Ye Zhuo,”Zhao Xueyin said. ”

“The surveillance cameras were broken anyway, and they were the real victims. ”

“Since things had come to this point, she had to drag ye Zao Down with her! ”

She wanted to see how ye Zao would prove that she did not do this.

“Zhao Xueyin continued, “Ye Zao is deliberately seeking revenge!” ”

“Are you sure it’s ye Zao?”The police officer asked.

“Zhao Xueyin nodded. “Yes, I saw him.” ”

“The police officer said, “Okay, then take us to her now.” ”

“Zhao Xueyin walked in front. “Officers, please follow me.” ”

The two police officers followed Zhao Xueyin’s footsteps.

“Not long after, they arrived at the door of Ye Zhuo’s office. ”

Zhao Xueyin reached out and knocked on the door.

“The person who opened the door was Secretary Aili. When she saw the two police officers outside, she was stunned. ”

“Zhao Xueyin continued, “Where’s chief ye?” ”

“”She’s, she’s inside,”Aili said. ”

“Go and call her out. The two officers are looking for her.”

Aili nodded. “Okay.”

“About a minute later, ye Zhuo walked out from inside. “Hello, Officer. I’m Ye Zhuo.” ”

The police officer standing in front immediately took out his police officer badge. “We’re police officers from the Peifeng Road Public Security Bureau. This lady has testified that you’re related to a crime of malicious assault. Please come with US and accept the investigation.”

Ye Zhuo’s eyebrows remained the same. “Crime of assault? Do you have evidence?”

“I am the evidence.”Zhao Xueyin stood out and said.

“Ye Zhuo ignored Zhao Xueyin and looked at the policeman. “Officer comrade, May I know the time and place of the accident?” ”

“”At two o’clock in the morning, the crime scene is in the basement of the Shunxi Financial Group.” ”

“”I have an alibi.”Ye Zhuo continued, “Ally, take two officers to look at the surveillance cameras.” ”

“Ally made a ‘please’gesture. “Officers, please follow me.” ”

Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes.

“Now that the entire surveillance system was broken, she really wanted to see where ye Zhuo could get an alibi! ”

“If she could not provide an alibi, she could only admit defeat! ”

“Ally brought the police officer to the Secretary’s office. “Officers, please wait a moment.” ”

“Okay.”The police officer nodded.

Zhao Xueyin stood behind Aili and looked at her like this. Her eyes turned from disdain to disbelief.

How could this be!

The entire surveillance system was clearly broken. Why was there no problem with the surveillance in Ye Zhuo’s office?

“After looking at the entire surveillance system, the police officer looked at Zhao Xueyin. “Miss Zhao, may I ask if you saw wrongly? From one to two o’clock, Miss Ye did not leave the office.” ”

“Zhao Xueyin’s face was a little pale. “But, maybe I’m really seeing things!” ”

“The police officer continued, “We still have to investigate this matter further. When we have the results, we will inform you.” ” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Alright.”Zhao Xueyin nodded.

The two police officers gave some instructions before leaving.

“Just as they left, one of the police officers asked curiously, “Brother Yin, Zhao Xueyin is that socialite who abused cats on the news, right?” ”

“Brother Yin nodded. “Yes, that’s her.” ”

“You really don’t know a person by their looks. She seems to be a pretty and kind-hearted girl. I didn’t expect her to be so vicious!”! “My girlfriend cried the entire night watching that cat abuse video. She still hasn’t recovered from it. I didn’t know that she would do it this way!”

In the secretarial room.

“Allie looked at Zhao Xueyin, her face no longer showing her usual respect. “Miss Zhao, chief ye asked me to tell you that there are still ten minutes before the meeting starts.” ”
