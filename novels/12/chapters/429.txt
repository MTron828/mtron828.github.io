ZY’s salary and treatment were very good!

“She was also the team leader, a standard white-collar worker. She earned at least 60,000 yuan a month. ” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

She did not want to leave Zy.

“The more the young woman thought about it, the more unwilling she became. Although ye Zhuo was capable, she was not from ZY after all. What right did she have to not let her come to work? ”

“You’re just a relative of director Zhao’s family. What right do you have to fire me!”

“Zhao Yang’s secretary hurriedly said, “Li Yayue, shut up! Where’s the head of the R & D Department? Hurry up and bring her to the personnel department to handle the resignation procedures!” ”

“As soon as she finished speaking, the entire place fell silent. ”

No one had expected that ye Zao still held real power in his hands.

Who Did she want to fire.

Just one sentence was enough.

And Ye Zao’s act of killing a chicken to warn the monkeys was especially good.

“With this act, who would dare to bully new employees in the future? ”

“After ye Zao left, Zhao Yang learned about what happened downstairs and thoroughly reorganized the atmosphere in the cubicle. ”

“For a time, everyone felt insecure. ”

“In the evening, Ye Zao and Cen Shaoqing went out for dinner. ”

This was the first time that Cen Shaoqing went out for dinner with ye Zao after his confession was successful.

He held ye Zao’s hand.

“His palm was covered in a layer of cold sweat, and even the tassels on the Buddhist beads were slightly moist. ”

“Are You Nervous?”Ye Zao looked back at Cen Shaoqing.

Cen Shaoqing was as calm as ever. “No.”

“Your hand is sweating.”

Cen Shaoqing’s expression did not change. “The temperature is high today.”

“Ye Zao chuckled. “Stop pretending. Right, what do you want to Eat Tonight?” ”

“”It’s up to you,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

Ye Zhuo deliberately teased him. “But I want to eat meat.”

“CEN Shaoqing said slowly, “Then I’ll follow you as husband and wife.” ”

His deep voice was a little hoarse and deeply rooted in people’s hearts.

Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows in surprise. “Really?”

“Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Don’t forget, I already ate meat last night.” ”

Yes.

“In order to make ye Zhuo accept him, Cen Shaoqing ate steak and drank wine last night. ”

He broke the rule that he had been following for more than ten years.

“Then let’s eat barbecue tonight.”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing uttered a syllable from the depths of his throat.

...

“Because he was about to leave for the capital city, the next day, Ye Zhuo went to Lin Shasha’s house and gave her some revision materials for grade 12. ”

Lin Sha was in a very good condition.

“If things went on like this, the second-tier university would be stable. ”

“With a little effort, it was not impossible to get a first-tier university entrance exam. ”

“In the blink of an eye, it was the third day. ”

Cen Shaoqing sent ye Zao to the airport. “Are you really not coming with us?”

“Ye Zao shook his head. “I’ve already made an appointment with them! If I decide to go with you now, my friends and the others will definitely feel uncomfortable.” ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“At this moment, an lizi dragged her luggage and rushed over. “Sear Sear! Sear Sear!” ”

Ye Zhuo waved at her. “Lizi!”

The two girls hugged each other excitedly.

Cen Shaoqing felt a little uncomfortable watching this scene.

Even though an Lizi was a girl.

“After all, he had not wrapped ye Zhuo up yet. ”

“After the two of them hugged, an Lizi realized that Cen Shaoqing was here. “Mr. Cen is here too?” ”

“Hello.”

“Ye Zao held Cen Shaoqing’s arm and introduced him to an Lizi. “Lizi, Cen Shaoqing is my boyfriend now.” ”

Boyfriend?

Cen Shaoqing was stunned by the sudden happiness!

Ye Zao actually took the initiative to introduce him to her friend!

Did this mean that he occupied a very important position in ye Zao’s Heart?

An Lizi was also stunned!

“From the first time an Lizi saw Cen Shaoqing, she felt that he and ye Zao were a perfect match. ”

“But at that time, what did ye Zao Say? ”

She said that it was impossible for her to be together with Cen Shaoqing.

She even said that Cen Shaoqing was a monk.

She did not have any thoughts about her.

“She even said that if they were to be together, it would be unless Mars collided with Earth. ”

He did not expect that they would collide so quickly!

“Really?”An Lizi was in disbelief.

“Ye Zao nodded with a smile. “Look, I look like I’m joking with you.” ”

“Realizing that ye Zao was not joking, an lizi quickly said, “Congratulations! I wish you both a long and lasting marriage.” ”

Cen Shaoqing suddenly felt that an Lizi was a pretty good person.

He could even forgive an Lizi for hugging ye Zao just now.

“After that, an Lizi pulled ye Zao to the side and whispered, “Zao Zao, didn’t you say before that it was impossible for you to be with him? I already said that the two of you were having an affair in secret. See, I Was Right!” ”

“Ye Zao was a little embarrassed when he recalled what he had said in front of an Lizi. “Actually, I didn’t think that I would be with him.” ”
