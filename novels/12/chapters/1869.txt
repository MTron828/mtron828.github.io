Chapter 1870: 376: her whole face turned green

Translator: 549690339

“Okay.”Xu Yao hung up the phone.

He ziteng came very quickly.

“When Zhang Xue saw he ziteng come to pick Xu Yao up, her whole face turned green! ”

“No one expected that not only did he ziteng not abandon Xu Yao, but he also came to pick Xu Yao up personally. ”

Xu Yao looked at Zhang Xue and the corners of her mouth curled up.

There was a hint of sarcasm in it.

Zhang Xue wanted to fight with her?

Not even close!

“Sitting in the co-pilot seat of He ziteng, Xu Yao’s mind was full of thoughts. She recalled the scene that night, as well as the words of her mother. ”

“He ziteng had only not contacted her for a week, and those people were already mocking her. If one day, he ziteng really fell in love with someone else, what would she do? ”

It seemed that her mother was right.

“No matter what, she had to hold onto he ziteng tightly and not let him escape. ”

And the best way to catch a man was to use a child to tie him up.

“As long as she had a child, he ziteng would be in her hands. ”

“Thinking of this, Xu Yao narrowed her eyes. ”

“Seeing that she was leaning against the back of the chair, he ziteng handed her a glass of water. “Yaoyao, how much did you drink? Are you feeling unwell now?” ”

“”I only drank a small glass of champagne.”Xu Yao massaged her temples. “It’s probably because I don’t drink often, so my head hurts a little.” ” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Then you should drink some water first.”

Xu Yao took the water. “Thank you.”

“”Why are you being so polite with me?”He ziteng continued, “I heard that yogurt is used to cure alcohol. There’s a 711 in front. Let’s go in and have a seat.” ”

“Okay.”Xu Yao nodded.

“Soon, the car stopped at the parking spot in front of 711. ”

He ziteng helped Xu Yao out of the car.

“Xu Yao’s face was red, and her body was limp as if she had no bones. She lay on he ziteng’s body. ”

He ziteng’s face was also a little red.

“Compared to the other young masters in the rich and powerful families, he ziteng was still relatively clean. He rarely interacted with women. Suddenly being so close to Xu Yao made he ziteng feel a little uncomfortable, and his heart beat faster, especially when Xu Yao kept accidentally touching his abdominal muscles. ”

“Actually, Xu Yao was not drunk at all. Everything she did was just an act. ”

“He Ziteng’s emotional changes were all within her control. It could be seen that he ziteng really loved her. Otherwise, his heart would not be beating so fast. ”

Xu Yao curved her lips without a trace. Her eyes were full of pride.

“Very soon, they were inside 711. ”

“He Ziteng helped Xu Yao sit down in front of the table. “Take a seat first, I’ll go buy some yogurt.” ”

“Okay.”Xu Yao leaned on the table and answered.

He ziteng bought two boxes of yogurt.

“”Yaoyao, there are strawberry and mango flavors. Which one do you want?”He ziteng asked. ”

“”Strawberry,”Xu Yao answered. ”

“Okay.”

“He ziteng tore off the wrapper on the yogurt, picked up the spoon, and fed Xu Yao the yogurt. ”

“After a few mouthfuls, Xu Yao pushed the spoon to he ziteng’s mouth and said, “Why do you keep feeding me? Have a bite too.” ”

He had a bite too?

With the spoon that Xu Yao had eaten?

Wasn’t that equivalent to an indirect kiss?

He ziteng was stunned.

What did Xu Yao mean by this?

“Eat it! Why are you taking so long?”Xu Yao directly pushed the spoon into he ziteng’s mouth.

The sweet and sour taste quickly spread in his mouth.

He ziteng’s heart was beating a little fast.

He blurted out the truth after drinking.

“Although Xu Yao usually maintained a sense of distance from him, it was obvious that Xu Yao now treated him as one of his own. ”

This meant that Xu Yao also liked him.

He was not a one-sided lover at all.

“Thinking of this, he ziteng was ecstatic. ”

“Xu Yao asked with her drunken eyes, “Ziteng, is it good?” ”

“Yes.”He ziteng nodded.

“Xu Yao asked again, “Is it sweet?” ”

“Yes.”

“Xu Yao looked at he ziteng and continued, “There’s still a little left on your mouth. It’s going to be wasted.” ”

“Before he ziteng could react, Xu Yao stood up and kissed he ziteng on the lips. She swallowed all the yogurt that he ziteng had stained on the corner of his mouth. ”

He ziteng was stunned.

“He did not expect happiness to come so suddenly, and he did not expect Xu Yao to suddenly kiss him. ”

“Although this was not considered a kiss and Xu Yao was also unconscious, he ziteng was still very excited. ”

“Little did he know that from an angle that he could not see, Xu Yao’s eyes were full of calculating light. ”

“If this continued to develop, she would soon be pregnant with he ziteng’s child! ”

“The two of them came out from 711 again, and it was already half an hour later. ”
