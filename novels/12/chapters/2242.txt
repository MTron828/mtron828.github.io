“”How much does it cost to go to Wei Ya Garden, Master?”Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly, walked around to the other side, opened the door of the passenger seat, and leaned in. ”

Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips opened slightly. “It doesn’t cost much. You just have to give yourself to me.”

“TSK.”Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly. “Are you a human trafficker?”

“Only you.”Cen Shaoqing opened his mouth slowly and said in a low tone.

Ye Zhuo chuckled and took out his phone. He told the designated driver to drive the car back and the fee was transferred directly.

“Have you drunk?”Cen Shaoqing continued to ask.

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo gestured. “I drank just a little.”

“”Are you sure it’s just a little, not a hundred million?”Cen Shaoqing looked back and asked. ”

“It’s not that exaggerated.”Ye Zhuo leaned against the back of the chair and narrowed his eyes. “I only drank a few cocktails.”

“Perhaps the strength of the cocktails was a little too strong, so at this moment, ye Zhuo clearly felt a little dizzy. ”

Cen Shaoqing slowed down the car.

“Because the air conditioner was turned on in the car, the temperature was a little low. Cen Shaoqing took out a blanket and covered her with it. His movements were gentle, as if he was treating a rare treasure. ”

“After an unknown amount of time, the car stopped in front of the Cen family’s front door. ”

Ye Zhuo opened his eyes and saw Cen Shaoqing sitting in the driver’s seat reading a document.

“The sunlight shone through the window, leaving a faint layer of afterglow on his face, giving him a cold feeling. ”

It reminded ye Zhuo of a sentence.

“The sunlight was just right, and the years were stable. ”

“After a moment, Cen Shaoqing looked back slightly and opened his thin lips. “You’re Awake?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

Cen Shaoqing took out a can of iced mineral water from the fridge. “Drink some water to clear your mind.”

“Ye Zao took the mineral water and drank a mouthful. The clear water entered his throat, and he was indeed much more clear-headed. ”

Cen Shaoqing took away the blanket on her body. “Let’s get out of the car first.”

“Lie down for a while more.”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing covered ye Zao with the blanket again in silence.

“On the balcony on the third floor, Old Mrs. Cen looked at the car parked in the garden and fell into deep thought. She muttered, “These two children haven’t gotten out of the car. What are they doing inside?” ”

“Zhou Xiang walked over from the side and said meaningfully, “Are they doing bad things?” ”

Bad things that could be done between two adults could only be understood and not described.

“Impossible.”Old Madam Cen shook her head.

“Zhou xiang smiled and said, “How do you know that it’s impossible?” ”

“Old madam CEN continued, “Look at it for yourself. From just now until now, the car hasn’t moved at all. How could it possibly do something bad!” ”

Zhou Xiang nodded. “That’s true.”

...

On the other side.

“After Bai Jingshu returned home, she took out the Yuan dynasty official records and read the content that she had not read carefully before again. ”

She learned from the past.

“When she opened the book again, Bai Jingshu saw a different content in the middle. ”

It had to be said that Chen Yaosheng knew much more about Earth than she had imagined.

His words were elegant and his knowledge was rich. He was like a walking encyclopedia on Baidu.

“Even if it was just a sentence, he had his own opinions. ”

“Before she knew it, it was already dusk. Bai Jingshu closed the book and stood in front of the window to stretch. She began to think about how to return the book to Chen Yaosheng. ”

“After dinner, Bai Jingshu went to the teahouse near her house to sit. ”

“Today was different from the past. As soon as Bai Jingshu entered, she saw Chen Yaosheng sitting by the window. ”

Beside him was a pot of top-grade biluochun. He was reading a book with his eyes lowered.

It was a book that Bai Jingshu liked very much.

Bai Jingshu immediately turned around and went back to get the book.

“Because they were relatively close, Bai Jingshu returned with the book in less than ten minutes. ”

“Mr. Chen.”Bai Jingshu walked to Chen Yaosheng’s side. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Chen Yaosheng was engrossed in reading when he suddenly heard Bai Jingshu’s voice. He immediately looked up and saw that it was Bai Jingshu. He said in surprise, “Miss Bai!” ”

“”Okay.”Bai Jingshu placed the book on the table. “Mr. Chen, I’ll return the book to You.” ”

“Chen Yaosheng seemed to have suddenly realized something. “Miss Bai, it really is you. I thought I was mistaken!” ”

“After saying that, Chen yaosheng continued, “Miss Bai, since the book has been given to you, it is yours.” ”

“”Mr. Chen, I really can’t accept this book,”Bai Jingshu continued, “I won’t accept it without any merit.” ”

“Chen Yaosheng looked at Bai Jingshu, he said very frankly, “Miss Bai, I admit that I really like you very much. “But I can assure you that I didn’t mean anything by giving you this book. I just wanted it to show its value. Please don’t feel pressured. “If this behavior of mine puts pressure on you, then I apologize now! “Miss Bai, I’m Sorry!” ”
