Ye Zao:”...”

“CEN yuying said, “And me, Zao Zao. You took second girl’s things, so you can’t not take my things. “I’m the same as your second sister. I don’t know what you like either, so I just casually prepared some. You mustn’t despise it.””

“As soon as she said this, the maid brought over a few jewelry boxes. Inside were collection-level jade and a bracelet from a famous luxury brand...”

Ye Zao:”...”this was called casually preparing some?

“Cen Yueying said in a distressed manner, “The jewelry and skincare products were all bought by eldest sister and second sister. As the third sister, I can only make do with it.””

“After saying that, she stuffed the two car keys that she had prepared earlier into ye Zao’s hands. “You usually drive one for fun, and the other for school.””

Two cars.

One was a Lamborghini.

The other was an Aston Martin.

Ye Zao:”...”this was called making do with it?

“Seeing that her three sisters had given her gifts, Cen Yuyan had to make a move no matter how much she disliked ye Zao. Cen Yuyan took out a gold card from her bag. “Time is short, I didn’t have time to prepare a gift. You can keep this gold card.””

Now it was up to ye Zao to see if he dared to touch the money inside!

“”Thank you, fourth sister, but I really can’t take this card.””

“”Take it, you’re welcome.”Cen Yuyan directly stuffed it into ye Zao’s hand.”

“Ye Zao could only take it temporarily. He thought that when he returned later, he would pass it to Cen Shaoqing.”

“Seeing that ye Zao had taken the card, Cen Yuyan’s eyes revealed a disdainful look.”

She knew that ye Zhuo was here for the Cen family’s money.

What the four sisters gave today was enough for ye Zhuo to eat for the rest of his life!

Ye Zhuo turned to Cen Shaoqing. “Go and bring the gifts I prepared for the sisters.”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and became a porter.

“Cen Yueya said in surprise, “Yezi, you even prepared gifts for us?””

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Not long after, Cen Shaoqing returned with a few gift boxes.”

Cen Yuyan frowned slightly.

This ye Zhuo really knew how to calculate.

“The four sisters were so generous with their jewelry and luxury cars, yet ye Zhuo was using such cheap items to fool them!”

It was wrapped in paper boxes.

And it was so light.

One look and you could tell that it wasn’t anything good.

It was definitely from a street stall!

“Ye Zhuo distributed the gift boxes to everyone. “This is the eldest sister’s, this is the second sister’s, this is the third sister’s, this is the fourth sister’s, this is for Aunt Xiang, and the last one is Grandma’s.””

“Old Mrs. Cen said excitedly, “I have one too!””

“Of course.”

Cen Shaoqing:”...”it seemed like he was the only one who didn’t have one.

“”Thank you, Yezi!”Old Mrs. Cen hugged ye Zao.”

Zhou Xiang took out a photo album and showed it to Ye Zao.

The photo album was full of photos of CEN Shaoqing from 1 to 10 years old.

“Zhou Xiang smiled and said to ye Zao, “This child doesn’t like photos after 10 years.””

“”Aunt Xiang,”ye Zao pointed at a photo and said, “How old is this photo?””

“In the photo, Cen Shaoqing was holding a lollipop.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“This is a three-year-old.”

“Old Mrs. Cen looked at ye Zao and continued, “Yezi, do you know that this brat has another nickname?””

Cen Shaoqing’s eyebrows twitched.

“Ye Zao asked curiously, “What nickname?””

“Old Mrs. Cen was about to speak when Cen Shaoqing said, “Grandma, are you thirsty? I’ll Go get you a glass of water.””

Old Mrs. Cen glanced at him. “Go get it.”

Cen Shaoqing got up and went to get some water.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Grandma, what’s Cen Shaoqing’s nickname?””

Cen Shaoqing?

Cen Yuyan frowned slightly.

“In the Cen family, no one dared to call Cen Shaoqing by his first name.”

Wasn’t ye Zhuo a little too much?

He was just grandstanding!

“Old Mrs. Cen looked up at Cen Shaoqing’s back and waved at ye Zhuo. “Ye, come over here.””

Ye Zao bent down and walked over.

Old Mrs. Cen whispered in Ye Zao’s ear.

“Hearing this, Ye Zao covered his mouth with a smile in his eyes and said incredulously, “Really?””

“Old Mrs. Cen had a wicked smile on her face. “Look at what you’re saying, can I still joke with you about this? If you don’t believe me, you can experiment with it later.””

“When Cen Shaoqing came over with a cup in his hand, the few of them had already started to talk about other topics.”

It seemed like they had already moved on from the issue of the nickname.

Cen Shaoqing heaved a sigh of relief.

“At around four o’clock in the afternoon, ye Zao suggested to leave, and Cen Shaoqing sent her back.”

They got into the car.

Ye Zao had been staring at Cen Shaoqing the entire time.

“Cen Shaoqing felt uncomfortable under her stare. He twirled the Buddhist beads and said, “Zao Zao, if you have something to say, just say it.””
