“Zhang Pandi was standing in front of the car door. When she saw Yu Zifei approaching, her eyes lit up at first, but when she saw Yu Yuan beside Yu Zifei, her eyes quickly dimmed.”

Who was the little girl beside Yu Zifei?

Was She Yu Zifei’s new girlfriend?

How could he do this!

“They had only been separated for ten days, and Yu Zifei was already looking for a new lover.”

Zhang Pandi looked at Yu Yuan with hatred in her eyes.

A mistress!

A shameless mistress

“What was even more infuriating was that this mistress actually came to provoke her, the main palace!”

Zhang Pandi was feeling extremely uncomfortable.

“Yu Zifei walked up to Zhang Pandi and asked, “Why are you looking for me?””

“Zhang Pandi looked at Yu Zifei and said, “Let’s talk in private.””

“Yu Yuan held onto Yu Zifei’s arm and pretended to be intimate with him. “Brother Yu, is this your ex-girlfriend, Zhang Pandi? She doesn’t look good to me! Your taste in the past was too bad!””

“What are you talking about? What right do you have to talk about me like that in front of me?”Zhang Pandi clenched her fists and resisted the urge to hit him.

“”Yuan Yuan, don’t say too much.”Yu Zifei turned to look at Yu Yuan.”

Yu Yuan nodded and smiled. “I’ll listen to Brother Yu.”

Zhang Pandi was so angry that her lungs were about to explode!

Yu Zifei was her boyfriend!

She wouldn’t allow anyone to be so intimate with Yu Zifei.

“Yu Zifei looked at Zhang Pandi and continued, “Zhang Pandi, it will never be possible between us!”” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Zifei! Three years! We’ve been together for three years. Don’t you have any feelings for me now?”Zhang Pandi questioned.

“”Just think of it as my three years of youth being fed to the dogs. Zhang Pandi, I’ll still say the same thing. Leave some dignity for yourself. It’s really meaningless for you to be like this.”Yu Zifei had never been a sloppy person, since it had already been decided, some words should be clearly said!”

Dilly-dallying was meaningless.

“Zhang Pandi’s eyes instantly turned red, “Zifei, actually, I’ve always loved you deeply. I swear! “It was all my fault before. I had no choice in doing this. When I was young, my parents despised me as a girl and abandoned me. When I grew up, it wasn’t easy for me to get into the university that I liked. I entered the base that I’ve always wanted to enter. Perhaps all of this is nothing to you, but I’m different from you. I came from the countryside. Everything I have today has almost exhausted all of my efforts! “I can’t just watch all this disappear!””

Zhang Pandi’s life was also quite inspiring.

“She was born in a family that valued sons over daughters. After completing the nine-year compulsory education, her parents did not want to read to her. However, her grades were excellent, and she was admitted to the best high school in the city. In the end, the school made an exception and admitted her free of charge, not only was there no tuition fee, but she could also receive a scholarship every year.”

“With the scholarship, Zhang Pandi successfully completed three years of high school studies and was admitted to a key university. During the university period, Zhang Pandi worked part-time and studied. Finally, she studied as a graduate student. After graduating as a graduate student, zhang Pandi was admitted to the Cen’s base.”

“In the Cen’s base, she met Yu Zifei, a native of the capital.”

“Not only was Yu Zifei a native, but she was also good-looking. She was very compatible with Zhang Pandi’s criteria for choosing a spouse. Many times in her dreams, Zhang Panti was very glad that she chose the path of studying. It was studying that made her successful.”

“If she had not studied, but left school after graduating from junior high school to work as a migrant worker, then she would be like a childhood friend in the village.”

She had a friend named Chun Mei who was the same age as her. She was only twenty-eight years old and was already a mother of three children.

The eldest child was already twelve years old.

Zhang Pandi could not imagine how Chunmei lived such a life.

“Therefore, she had always cherished the relationship between her and Yu Zifei.”

“She was the first university student in her village to go out, and the first girl in her village to find a local boyfriend.”

She had always been proud of this.

“However, what she didn’t expect was that Yu Zifei would suddenly decide to join ye Zao’s aircraft carrier project team.”

“Once the aircraft carrier project failed, Yu Zifei would have nothing.”

“Zhang Pandi couldn’t accept such a boyfriend, let alone such a failure.”

“Helplessly, she could only choose to break up with Yu Zifei.”

She really had no choice!

“At this point, Zhang Panti paused, then she said, “Choosing to break up with you and be with Zhou Rui was my last resort! I Don’t Love Zhou Rui at all. I just wanted to use him for a while. I originally wanted to break up with him after using Zhou Rui...””
