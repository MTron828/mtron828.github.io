“Yu Xiannian reminded him, “Zixu, look carefully. Don’t Miss Anything.” ”

“As he spoke, he observed Cen Shaoqing’s expression. ”

He thought Cen Shaoqing would definitely be angry.

“However, CEN Shaoqing’s expression did not change at all. There was not even the slightest fluctuation. ”

This was a little strange.

“Just as Yu Xiannian was puzzled, Cen Shaoqing returned the letter to Yu Xiannian. ”

“You have no reaction at all?”Yu Xiannian looked at Cen Shaoqing and asked in surprise.

Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads. “What reaction should I have?”

“”Aren’t you angry that I asked you to wear women’s clothing?”Yu Xiannian sized Cen Shaoqing up and down before continuing, “Or do you have a hobby of wearing women’s clothing?” ” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Cen Shaoqing slowly curled his lips. “You should be worried about yourself.”

“I’m worried about myself? What am I worried about?”Yu sunset looked confused.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Have you thought about what women’s clothing you’ll wear that day?” ”

“Yu sunset turned to look at Cen Shaoqing and suddenly laughed out loud. “Zixu, you don’t think I’ll lose, do you?” ”

What a joke!

How could he possibly lose!

“”If you don’t lose, who will?”Cen Shaoqing asked back. ”

“Cen Shaoqing knew ye Zao too well. She never did anything that she was not confident in. Since she dared to make a written agreement with Yu Mumu, she would definitely win. ”

“Yu mumu laughed hysterically, “Zixu, ah, Zixu! You are really smart and muddle-headed for a Lifetime!” ”

Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads and did not say a word.

“Yu Luonian continued, “To tell you the truth, Zixu, Xian ‘er has been with me for three years, and no one knows her better than I do! Let alone three months, she might not even last half a month! So, your wife is going to lose for sure!” ”

“As he said that, Yu Luonian touched his chin and said, “I haven’t seen you in women’s clothing!” ”

“When the time came, the scene would definitely be very exciting! ”

“”It’s a coincidence that I haven’t seen you in women’s clothing either,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

Yu sunset was a little speechless.

It was true that a family did not enter the same house. Ye Zhuo had also said the same thing in front of him.

“Yu sunset smiled and said, “You’re a classic case of not shedding tears until you’re in the coffin!” ”

“”I’ll give you the same thing.”Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads. “Sometimes, blind confidence is not a good thing.” ”

“Water can carry a boat, but it can also overturn it. ”

“Yu Xiannian shook his head and continued, “No wonder people say that the IQ of men and women in love is negative.” ”

Cen Shaoqing was a good example.

“Yu Xiannian continued, “I have to hurry up and choose a dress for women.” ”

Cen Shaoqing looked at him in confusion.

“Yu Xiannian waved the receipt in his hand. “It says clearly that the winner can personally choose the dress for the loser. In other words, you have to wear whatever I choose!” ”

“”Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly, looking very easy to talk to. ”

Yu Muannian looked at Cen Shaoqing and narrowed his eyes.

“”Zixu, you won’t go back on your words at the last minute, right?” ”

Cen Shaoqing didn’t look like a person who would obediently wear women’s clothes no matter how one looked at him.

“”Not to mention that our leader won’t lose, even if our leader really loses, I won’t go back on my words.”Cen Shaoqing said word by word, and his voice was powerful. ”

“Yu Mumu nodded and said with a smile, “Okay, okay, okay. I’ll remember what you said.” ”

“What About You?”Cen Shaoqing turned to look at Yu Mumu.

“Yu Mumu was stunned and asked, “What About Me?” ”

“CEN Shaoqing said slowly, “What if you go back on your word?” ”

“”I won’t lose at all, so I won’t have such an assumption,”Yu Mumu said confidently. ”

Cen Shaoqing chuckled but didn’t say anything.

“Seeing him like this, Yu sunset continued, “If I regret it, I’ll stick my head in the toilet!” ”

Cen Shaoqing took out his phone. “Say it again. I didn’t hear it clearly just now.”

Yu sunset immediately repeated it.

He wasn’t afraid at all.

Because he wouldn’t lose!

Cen Shaoqing curled his lips slightly. “I’ve already recorded it.”

“Yu Mumu continued, “That’s not fair.” ”

“What’s Not Fair?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“Yu Mumu said, “You recorded mine, but I didn’t record yours.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads and continued, “Record it. I’ll cooperate with you.” ”

Yu Mumu immediately took out his phone.

Just wait and see. How confident Cen Shaoqing was now would be how regretful he would be when the time came.

“Is there anything else?”Cen Shaoqing continued to ask.

“”Not for the time being,”Yu Mumu said. ”

Cen Shaoqing turned around and left. “I’ll be leaving first.”

“Let’s go.”

Yu Mumu looked at Cen Shaoqing’s back and his eyes were filled with smiles.

“He had known Cen Shaoqing for many years, but he had never taken advantage of him in front of Cen Shaoqing. This was the first time! ”
