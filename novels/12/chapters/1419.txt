“If she didn’t make it, she would force Zhou Zuolong to kill her. ”

Could it be that Zhou Zuolong could only watch her die?

That was absolutely impossible!

“After hearing Xie Wanqiu’s words, Zheng Wanyin and Xie rongle heaved a sigh of relief. ”

Very soon.

The few of them left the hospital.

“Standing on the highway, Zheng Wanyin asked, “Grandma, where are We Going Now?” ”

“Xie wanqiu said, “To the Cen Family!” ”

“Cen Shaoqing was her grandson, and Zhou Xiang was her daughter. ”

“If she didn’t go to the Cen family, where would she go? ”

Zheng Wanyin nodded.

“Xie Rong said happily, “I’ll call a taxi.” ”

“Soon, they stopped a taxi. ”

“After getting in the taxi, Zheng Wanyin gave the address of the Cen family manor. ”

The Cen family manor was a famous wealthy district.

“Hearing this address, the driver in the front seat turned around and looked at Zheng Wanyin curiously. ”

“Half an hour later, the car stopped at the entrance of the Cen Manor. ”

The driver turned around and looked at Zheng Wanyin. “Do you have a pass here? You are not allowed to enter without a pass.”

“Xie wanqiu said, “I’m here at my daughter’s house. What Pass Do I Need?” ”

“As long as she and Zhou Zuolong were not divorced, she would still be Zhou Xiang’s mother. ”

“The driver continued, “May I know your daughter’s name?” ”

“Zhou Xiang!”Xie wanqiu said.

“After learning Zhou Xiang’s name, the chauffeur turned around to negotiate with the security personnel. ”

“After a while, the chauffeur turned around and continued, “Old Lady, I’m still not allowed to go in.” ”

“”What should we do, Grandma!”Zheng Wanyin looked at Xie wanqiu. “Second aunt seems to be really angry this time.” ”

“I’ll go down and take a look.”Xie wanqiu pushed the door open and got out.

“A few security guards stood in front of the car, preventing the driver from driving in. ”

“Xie wanqiu put on the airs of a wealthy lady, held her head high and puffed out her chest, and quickly walked over, “I’m Zhou Xiang’s mother. Why Won’t you let me in? Do you know who my daughter is? Cen Wuye’s mother has offended me. You’ll Get What You Deserve!” ”

“Mrs. Cen’s mother?”The security captain looked up at Xie Wanqiu. “Who doesn’t know that Mrs. Cen’s mother has been dead for many years! You’re lying. Why Don’t you take a look at this place!”

“Another security guard at the side said in a low voice, “Captain, do you think she looks like the Xie wanqiu that’s trending on the internet?” ”

“A few days ago, because Zhou Jin went to the north to search for her, Zhou Zuolong and Xie Wanqiu had become ‘popular’all over the internet. ”

“Especially Xie wanqiu. Not only was she a mistress, but she had also forced her original spouse to death. ”

“At this moment, Xie Wanqiu was even more of a street rat than a street rat. ”

“Hearing this, the captain immediately took out his phone. When he saw her, his expression changed. ”

It was true!

“Xie wanqiu thought that the security guards had recognized her. After all, she had been to the Cen family manor before this, so it was normal for them to suddenly recognize her. ”

“”Since you’ve recognized her, hurry up and let us in! Otherwise, I’ll get my daughter to fire all of you!” ”

The security captain looked up at Xie Wanqiu. “So you’re that Mistress?”

Mistress?

Xie Wanqiu was stunned.

“”If I were you, I would just find a pillar and kill myself. You actually have the face to come here. What a disgrace!” ”

“Shameless!”A rotten vegetable leaf flew over from somewhere.

“”You killed someone’s mother, and now you have the face to acknowledge your daughter! You’re so capable, why don’t you go to Heaven?” ”

“How could our China have such a shameless person like you!”

PA —

“This time, it was a rotten egg that was thrown at her. ”

“Xie Wanqiu’s face was covered in the mucus of the rotten egg, and she was on the verge of breaking down. “Who threw it? ! Who threw the rotten egg? ! Call the police! I want to call the police!” ”

“”Grandma, get in the car first!”Zheng Wanyin saw that something was not right, so she reached out and pulled Xie wanqiu back into the car. “Master, let’s go back to the city first.” ”

“The driver covered his nose and said, “Don’t get that rotten egg into my car!” ”

“”Don’t worry, it won’t Happen!”Zheng Wanyin took out a tissue to wipe Xie wanqiu’s face. “Grandma, Are You Alright?” ”

Xie Wanqiu was in a daze

“She had a feeling that this time, she might really be kicked out by Zhou Zuolong. ”

No.

No.

“No matter what, she could not let such a thing happen. ”

“Xie wanqiu raised her head and looked at Zheng Wanyin. “Yinyin, go back to the city and find a hotel for us to stay at first. Then, take a look and see if your wechat has been deleted by Zhou Zuolong!” ”

“”Okay.”Zheng Wanyin nodded and took out her phone to take a look. On wechat, Zhou Zuolong was still on her friend list. ”

“Zheng Wanyin sent him a wechat Message: [ Grandpa, Where Are You Now? Can you explain the misunderstanding in person? Grandma’s situation is very bad. ] ”
