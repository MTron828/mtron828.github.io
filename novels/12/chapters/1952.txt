Translator: 549690339

“If he couldn’t even wait for three years, how could it be considered true love? ”

“After a moment, he ziteng looked up at his mother. “Alright, three years it is.” ”

He would let his mother know that he and Xu Yao were not just playing around.

They were truly in love.

Not to mention three years.

“Even if it was thirty years, he could still afford to wait! ”

“Mother he nodded. “Alright, you’re ambitious. Let’s talk about this in three years. I hope your Xu Yao won’t disappoint you.” ”

The conversation between the mother and Son in the study room was heard by the servants outside.

The servants immediately sent a text message to inform Mi Chen.

“After Mi Chen heard the news, she asked Xu Yao out. ”

“When she heard this, Xu Yao frowned. “This old B * Tch actually wants me to wait for three years!” ”

Three years!

How could that be possible!

No one could guarantee what would happen three years later.

Who knew if he ziteng would change his mind halfway through?

“Mi Chen glanced at her and continued, “So, you have to get pregnant immediately. Have you felt anything recently?” ”

“”Not yet.”Xu Yao shook her head and said worriedly, “Mi Chen, do you think there’s something wrong with me?” ”

“She had been with he ziteng for a long time and had taken the medicine. Furthermore, she was still ovulating every time. Why couldn’t she get pregnant? ”

This was too strange!

Xu Yao was very worried.

“Mi Chen said, “Don’t worry. Your body is fine. You Can’t rush things like this. You might get pregnant one day.” ”

“Mi Chen was a doctor. When she heard that she was fine, Xu Yao heaved a sigh of relief. ”

She was really afraid that she wouldn’t be able to get pregnant.

“”Mi Chen, thank you.”Xu Yao looked at Mi Chen. ”

“Mi chen smiled and said, “I should be the one thanking you. Thank you for giving me the chance to love you again and protect you.” ”

Xu Yao smiled.

“After spending more than half an hour with Mi Chen, Xu Yao returned to the apartment. ”

“Not long after she returned, he ziteng returned. ”

“His mother had finally agreed to let him be with Xu Yao, so he ziteng was in a good mood. He smiled and said, “Yaoyao, I’m Back! I have good news for You!” ”

“What Good News?”Xu Yao walked out from the side.

“He ziteng picked Xu Yao up and said excitedly, “Yaoyao, my mother has agreed to be with us.” ”

“Really?”Xu Yao asked in surprise.

“”Of course it’s true!”He ziteng nodded and continued, “But my mother has a condition.” ”

“Hearing that, a dark light flashed in Xu Yao’s eyes. ”

Damn old B * Tch!

“What condition?”Xu Yao asked with a smile.

“He ziteng continued, “She wants us to talk for three years first. Yaoyao, you’ll wait for me for three years, right?” ”

“Xu Yao nodded. “Yes, I will wait for you.” ”

“After saying that, Xu Yao asked, “What if you change your mind Midway and fall in love with someone else?” ”

“”That won’t happen, Yaoyao. My feelings for you can be seen by the heavens and the moon. I will never change my mind! Please believe me!”After saying that.., he ziteng raised three fingers and continued, “Yaoyao, I can swear to the heavens. If I go against them, the heavens will strike me with lightning!” ”

Xu Yao laughed and covered he ziteng’s mouth. “Who asked you to swear? I believe in You.”

“”Yaoyao, thank you.”He ziteng hugged Xu Yao emotionally. ”

“”Just now, you said that I was stupid. You are clearly the fool.”Xu Yao reached out and pinched he ziteng’s nose. “You even have to thank me! You are the biggest fool in the world!” ”

He ziteng hugged Xu Yao tightly.

God was so good to him that he gave him such a considerate girlfriend.

He ziteng felt that he must have saved the Milky Way galaxy in his previous life.

“In the days that followed, Mi Chen would use the excuse of applying medicine to Xu Yao almost every afternoon to have sex with her for about an hour. ”

Xu Yao enjoyed such a time very much.

Mi Chen was her first love. Only when she was with Mi Chen did she truly feel the joy of love.

He ziteng was also very handsome.

“However, compared to Mi Chen, he was still far away. ”

“Xu Yao sat on Mi Chen’s body and hugged his neck. “Mi Chen, I really want to spend the rest of my life with you.” ”

Unfortunately.

“Apart from love, Mi Chen couldn’t give her anything else she wanted. ”

“Mi Chen hugged her tightly as a vicious glint flashed across her eyes. “Yaoyao, don’t worry. There will be such a day.” ”

Xu Yao didn’t take those words to heart.

Creak.

“At that moment, the sound of the door opening was heard in the air. ”

Following that was the sound of footsteps.

He ziteng had returned?

Why would he ziteng return at this time?

Xu Yao immediately stood up from Mi Chen’s body and tidied up her clothes with her head lowered.

She looked at Mi Chen and calmly tidied up her medical kit.

“Ten seconds later, he ziteng walked in and saw Xu Yao and Mi Chen sitting on the sofa. ”

“Xu Yao asked in surprise, “Ziteng, why did you come back at this time?” ”

“”I came back to get a document.”He ziteng also felt strange since he was the one who asked Mi Chen to come over. He continued, “Doctor Mi, is Yaoyao’s wound better?” ”

“Mi Chen nodded and smiled. “Don’t worry, Mr. He. Miss Xu’s wound is much better. It Won’t take long for her to recover!” ”

“Really?”He ziteng said happily.

“Yes.”Mi Chen nodded. “But you still need to be careful these few days. Don’t touch water.”

“Okay.”He ziteng nodded.

“After taking the documents, he ziteng continued, “Yaoyao, I’ll be leaving first. Goodbye, Doctor Mi.” ”

“”Take care, Mr. He.”Mi Chen stood up. ”

“Xu Yao walked he ziteng out of the door and straightened his tie for him. She smiled and said, “Come back early tonight. I’ll wait for you at home for dinner.” ”

“He ziteng lowered his head and kissed Xu Yao. Then he said, “Baby, I may not be able to eat at home tonight.” ”

Xu Yao was stunned. “Why? I wanted to prepare your favorite curry chicken for you!”

“”I know you’re virtuous,”he ziteng continued, “Your Hand is injured, so don’t do too much hard work. I have an important party tonight, so you should go to bed early after dinner.” ”

“Xu Yao was a very good girl. No matter how late it was, she would wait for him to come back and eat together. ”

“In the past, he ziteng did not have the habit of eating at home. ”

“Ever since he got together with Xu Yao, he had formed the habit of going home for dinner. ”

“”Okay.”Xu Yao nodded and continued, “You can’t be mesmerized by the beautiful ladies outside!” ”

“”Don’t worry. No matter how beautiful the beautiful ladies outside are, they are not as beautiful as you.”He ziteng pinched Xu Yao’s face. ”

“The warm scene outside fell into the eyes of Mi Chen, who was standing in front of the French window. ”

Mi Chen narrowed her eyes.

A dark light flashed in her eyes.

Xu Yao belonged to him alone. No one could take her away from him!

No one!

“A few minutes later, Xu Yao came back from outside. ”

“Just as she pushed the door open, she was hugged by Mi Chen. ”

“Xu Yao smiled and said, “Aren’t you afraid of the surveillance cameras?” ”

“Mi Chen said, “Don’t worry, I’ve modified the surveillance cameras.” ”

“Mi Chen buried her head in Xu Yao’s shoulder and said, “Yaoyao, I want to stay for dinner tonight.” ”

“”No,”Xu Yao refused directly. ”

“Why not?”Mi Chen asked.

“Xu Yao continued, “Aren’t you afraid that he ziteng will find out?” ”

“I heard everything.”Mi Chen passionately kissed Xu Yao’s neck. “He’s coming back very late tonight.”

“Hearing this, Xu Yao raised her head in surprise. “You can hear him from so far away?” ”

“Mi Chen continued, “I can read lips.” ”

“You’re really amazing!”Xu Yao said.

Mi Chen hugged Xu Yao. “When will you be able to conceive a child with the surname he?”

Xu Yao sighed. “I also want to conceive as soon as possible.”

“”I will,”mi Chen said. ”

Time passed very quickly.

“In the blink of an eye, the lantern festival had passed. ”

Ye Zhuo returned to his busy work.

“Apart from going to school occasionally to do experiments, she also had to go to Mars to live permanently. ”

“The project on Mars had already been completed by 50% . Currently, it was officially the most crucial fitting. When Ye Zhuo was busy, he would usually not be seen for ten days to half a month. He could not be reached by phone or cell phone. ”

Cen Shaoqing was also very busy during this period of time.

“Master Five.”The assistant walked into the office.

“Speak.”Cen Shaoqing held the Buddha bead in his hand and spoke concisely.

“The assistant continued, “Master Five, this is a picture of the area where Mr. Cen was in trouble before the accident.” ”

Cen Shaoqing stretched out his hand to take the picture and fell into deep thought. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

He now suspected that the matter of his father was inextricably linked to planet E-TY889.

Because the ship in question was huge.

It was impossible for it to disappear without a trace.

“Unless, it was man-made. ”

“Ever since his father’s accident, Cen Shaoqing had never given up on searching for the ship in question. Even now, the search team was still working, but they could not find anything. ”

Ye Zhuo’s experiments on Mars were also related to going to Planet E-TY889.

“After all, Planet E-TY889 had companions who would fight with her and advance and retreat with her. ”

So...

She had to think of a way to go back.

“”Miss Ye.”Just then, Tang Mi’s voice sounded from outside the door. ”

Ye Zhuo put down the document in his hand and looked back slightly. “Come in.”
