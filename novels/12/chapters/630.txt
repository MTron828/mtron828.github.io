“”Yes.”Mr. Zhang stood up and looked at Ye Zhuo. “This must be Miss Lin, right? I’m Mr. Zhang, the person-in-charge of the female Durban class. I’ll be your teacher in the future.” ”

Teacher?

“In that case, was Old Lady Lin for real? ”

“”Female Durban, right?”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. Her beautiful phoenix-like eyes were clear in black and white. “Alright, I’ll go with you.” ”

“What had Boss Ye, who stood at the top of the technological world, not seen before? ”

This was the first time she had seen a female Durban.

She wanted to see what kind of person would be able to create such a harmful training class for women!

This kind of cancer in society should be wiped out in one go!

Old Madam Lin was stunned.

She did not expect this Mr. Zhang to be so amazing.

He had dealt with ye Zao in one sentence.

Ye Zao did not even dare to make a sound.

A professional was a professional!

Formidable!

“Mr. Zhang looked at Old Madam Lin. “Old Madam, we’ll be leaving first.” ”

“”Alright, go ahead.”Old Madam Lin nodded her head. ”

Ye Zao followed Zhang Ziyue’s footsteps.

“Looking at Ye Zao’s back, a smug look appeared in Aunt Zhang’s eyes. ”

She had thought that ye Zao was a difficult person to deal with.

She didn’t expect a female Durban to make ye Zao Obedient.

It seemed that this Mr. Zhang really had tricks up his sleeves.

“Female Durban valued the superiority of men over women. They didn’t fight back, and they didn’t fight back when they were scolded. After a month, Ye Zao was just a puppet that could be manipulated. What qualifications did she have to compete with Feng Xianxian? ”

She couldn’t even compare to a strand of Feng Xianxian’s hair!

“After ye Zhuo left, aunt Zhang called Feng Qianhua and told her about ye Zhuo’s trip to female Durban. ”

“After Feng Qianhua heard about this, she was very happy. After hanging up the phone, she immediately made another call and instructed the female Durban leaders to ‘take care of’ye Zhuo. ”

“With the female Durban leaders taking care of him, Ye Zhuo would definitely be reborn! ”

“After hanging up, Feng Xianxian walked over. “Mom, who are you talking to?” ”

“Feng Qianhua said, “Your Aunt Sun.” ”

Aunt Sun?

Sun Shu from the female Durban?

Feng Xianxian frowned. “Why are you looking for her?”

“Sun Shu was feudal and old-fashioned. Feng Xianxian, who had received a new-style education, really did not like her. ”

She did not like Sun Shu’s lessons on womanhood even more.

“Unfortunately, Feng Qianhua liked it. ”

“Fortunately, Sun Shu did not deliberately make things difficult for her like she did for Feng Qianhua’s sake. ”

“Feng Qianhua said, “I’ll ask your Aunt Sun to take care of Ye Zhuo in the women’s Durban Class.” ”

“Women’s Durban? Ye Zhuo also went to women’s Durban?”Feng Qianqian was very surprised.

She had never expected ye Zhuo to go to women’s Durban.

The profession was too incredible.

“Yes.”Feng Qianhua nodded. “Your grandma Lin signed her up this afternoon.”

“”Then, is she willing to go?”Feng Qianqian and Ye Zhuo had stayed in the same dormitory. ”

She knew very well that ye Zhuo was not the kind of person who would bow his head easily.

“Feng Qianhua smiled and said, “It’s not up to her to go or Not! Your Grandma Zhang said that she was already taken to women’s Durban by Mr. Zhang in the evening.” ”

“Really?”Feng Qianqian’s eyes lit up.

Feng Qianhua nodded. “That’s why I asked Your Auntie Sun to take care of her.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Auntie Sun agreed?”Feng Qianqian asked immediately.

“Feng Qianhua smiled and said, “With my relationship with your Auntie Sun, how could she not agree?” ”

She and Sun Shu had known each other for more than ten years.

“Otherwise, she would not be at ease to let Feng Qianqian apply for female Durban as well. ”

“That’s Great!”

Feng Qianqian was very happy in her heart.

“Sun Shu was already forty years old, but she was still unmarried. She was a little perverted. ”

“There were endless ways to educate people. There was no dignity to speak of. Moreover, ye Zao had to be specially taken care of. ”

She didn’t expect ye Zao to have such a Day!

“Feng Qianqian continued, “Mom, then let’s go to the Lin family later to take a look. I heard that Grandma Lin went to the Cen family today. I don’t know how the situation is now!” ”

“At the mention of this question, the smile on Feng Qianhua’s face faded a little. “That old hag of the Cen family is blind. She rejected your grandma Lin.” ”

“What?”Feng Qianqian was stunned.

“She originally thought that with Old Lady Lin personally making a move, this matter shouldn’t be a big problem. ”

“After all, Old Lady Lin and Old Lady Cen were close friends. ”

Could it be that old lady cen could reject the granddaughter-in-law that Old Lady Lin personally introduced?

“But now, Old Lady Cen actually rejected it! ”

“Feng qianhua frowned and said, “It’s because that old lady from the Cen family rejected it. In order to help you vent your anger, your grandmother Lin moved ye Zhuo to female Durban!” ”
