Chapter 162: 085: Lovely Old Lady Cen, my granddaughter-in-law is the most beautiful woman in the world! 6

“Auntie, do you think this is your bag?”

The middle-aged woman did not think that ye Zhuo would be able to snatch the bag back.

She looked at Ye Zhuo in surprise. “Yes, yes, yes! This is my bag!”

Ye Zhuo did not return the bag to her immediately. Instead, he said, “I’m sorry, Auntie. Before I confirm that you are the owner of this bag, I can’t give it to you. Oh right, do you have a cell phone in this bag?”

Ye Zhuo knew this bag.

Because she also had one.

It was a gift from elder Yang.

The official website sold it for seven digits.

The middle-aged woman smiled and said, “Little sister, I know what you mean. Don’t worry. This bag is mine. My cell phone is inside. The cell phone lock is unlocked with my face. Take out your cell phone and Pat it on my face. It will be unlocked.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Ye Zao nodded. He unzipped the bag and took out his phone. “That’s offensive.”

The phone camera was aimed at the middle-aged woman’s face.

The lock was automatically unlocked.

After confirming that the bag and phone belonged to the middle-aged woman, Ye Zao returned the things to the middle-aged woman.

......

The middle-aged woman smiled and looked at Ye Zao. “Little sister, you are very responsible! By the way, how did you catch that Thief?”

One wouldn’t know if one didn’t look.

When she saw it, she was shocked.

This little girl was too beautiful.

She had always thought that she was very good-looking. Standing next to her son, she was like a brother and sister.

But this little girl was simply too good!

Her lips were red and her teeth were white.

It was as if she was drawn from a painting.

Even for a woman like her, her heart was racing when she saw it, let alone a man.

Ye Zhuo said, “I’m the school’s long-distance running champion. That thief felt that he couldn’t outrun me, so he returned my bag to me.”

“Thank you so much!”The middle-aged woman grabbed ye Zhuo’s hand. “Little girl, What’s Your Name? How Old Are you this year?”

“Auntie, My Name Is Ye Zhuo. I’m eighteen this year.”

“Aiya! Don’t Call Me Auntie! You’ve already called me old. Just Call Me Big Sister!”The middle-aged woman continued, “My name is Zhou Xiang. You can call me big sister Xiang. Oh right, there’s a dessert shop over there. Let me treat you to dessert.”

With such a young girl calling her sister, Zhou Xiang felt that she could be younger by more than ten years.

Moreover, not only was this girl young, she was also so beautiful.

Even song Chenyu, who was known as the number one beauty in five thousand years, felt embarrassed when she stood beside her.

She was really too beautiful!

Dessert was ye Zhuo’s life.

If this was any other day, she would definitely agree without hesitation.

But today was not the day. She still had to go review for Lin Sha.

“Thank you for your kindness, but I still have something to do.”

Zhou Xiang held ye Zao’s hand. “I’ll Call You Zao! Zao, you helped me get my bag back. I must thank you properly. Oh right, how much is your wechat? Let’s add it on wechat?”

Zhou Xiang was too enthusiastic. Ye Zao could not take it anymore and had to take out his phone. “Let me scan you.”

“I’ve already said that you can just call me sister Zhou Xiang. Zao Zao, you’re too polite! Come, let me scan you! Bring out the QR code.”

Ye Zao brought out the QR code.

The two of them added each other on wechat.

Ye Zao added [ sister Zhou Xiang ] .

Zhou Xiang added [ Beauty Zao ] to Ye Zao.

After adding wechat, Zhou Xiang continued, “Zao Zao, where are you going? My chauffeur will be here soon. I’ll get him to send you.”

“Thank you, Sister Zhou Xiang. The place I’m going to is nearby. I can walk there. It Won’t take more than a few minutes.”

Zhou xiang continued, “I happen to have nothing to do. I’ll send you there.”

“That would be too much trouble.”

Zhou Xiang waved her hand. “It’s no trouble, no trouble at all.”Zhou Xiang was a complete beauty lover. She could not walk when she saw a pretty girl. Previously, she did not like female celebrities in the entertainment industry, ever since she got to know song Chenyu, she had smelled so good!

Moreover, Ye Zao was even more beautiful than song Chenyu.

Unfortunately.

Her son was not interested in women.

Otherwise, she would have wanted to trick ye Zao into becoming her daughter-in-law.

With such a beautiful daughter-in-law, she would wake up from her dream with a smile.

Ye Zao could not decline her kind offer, so he had to ask Zhou Xiang to send her to the residential area where Lin Shasha lived.

“Sister Zhou Xiang, I’m here.”

“You’re here already?”Zhou Xiang looked reluctant.

Ye Zao nodded.

Zhou Xiang continued, “Then go in quickly! Don’t make your friend wait so anxiously. I’m going back too.”

“Goodbye, Sister Zhou Xiang.”

“Goodbye.”

If she had known that ye Zao Would Come Back Today, Lin Shasha had specially bought ye Zao’s favorite dessert in advance.
