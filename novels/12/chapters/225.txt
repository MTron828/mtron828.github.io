Translator: 549690339

No one had expected that ye Zhuo and Embert knew each other.

Those who had been mocking ye Zhuo for being an idiot suddenly felt their faces hurt.

How could an idiot know Embert?

“”Sister Mu, let’s go and have a drink.”At this moment, Xu Jiao walked over to Mu Yourong and held her hand. ”

“With Xu Jiao’s help, Mu Yourong’s expression softened. ”

“”Sister Mu, how does that Idiot Know Embert?”Xu Jiao asked. ”

“Mu yourong continued, “My dad and Mr. Embert are quite close...” ”

“Xu Jiao frowned slightly and immediately understood what Mu Yourong meant, “So, Mr. Embert went to greet ye Zhu on account of Uncle Mu! “But it’s so unfair to you! “You’re the real Miss Mu! “How can ye Zao Swagger around with your identity? !” ”

Ye Zao was so Shameless!

“Mu yourong hurriedly explained, “Jiao Jiao, I didn’t mean that. Don’t misunderstand! In fact, Sister Ye Zao is a very kind girl...” ”

“Xu Jiao snorted. “Sister Mu! You’re the one who’s really kind! If she’s kind, she won’t be able to take over the family! Wait, I’ll teach her a lesson for you!” ”

“Jiao Jiao! Don’t do this!”Mu Yourong hurriedly tugged at Xu Jiao’s sleeve.

“Xu Jiao said, “Sister Mu, I know you’re a person who doesn’t even dare to step on an ant on the road, but I’m different from you. I’m a straightforward person and I don’t like to see good people being wronged! “Don’t worry! “I’ll definitely help you vent your anger!” ”

“With that, Xu Jiao picked up the goblet on the table and turned to walk toward Ye Zhuo. ”

Ye Zao was chatting with Mr. Embert.

“”Miss Ye, I received the design draft you sent me last night! It’s very good! It’s in line with our corporate culture! I believe that once this single product is released, the demand will exceed the supply.” ”

Ye Zao picked up his goblet. “Thank you for your approval.”

Embert picked up his goblet as well.

Bang

“At this moment, a person suddenly walked over and directly bumped into ye Zhuo. ”

“Even though ye Zhuo was agile, some red wine was still spilled on his body. ”

“”Don’t you watch where you’re Going?”Ye Zhuo frowned slightly. Even if she was an idiot, she should be able to tell that Xu Jiao did it on purpose. ”

It was because she was good at fighting.

If it were anyone else...

They would have fallen to the ground by now.

Embert was startled. “Are You Alright?”

Ye Zhuo shook his head slightly to show that he was fine.

“Xu Jiao said sarcastically, “I’m sorry. I didn’t see clearly.” ”

“”You didn’t see clearly?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly. “If you didn’t see Clearly, why didn’t you bump into the Buffet Table?” ”

As soon as he said this...

Everyone looked over.

So many people were looking at her.

“Xu Jiao’s eyes immediately turned red and she said pitifully, “Miss Ye, I’m sorry. I really didn’t see it clearly.” ”

“Mu Yourong walked over from the side and tried to smooth things over with a smile. “Sister Ye, everyone makes mistakes. Jiao Jiao has already apologized to you. She didn’t even nod her head when she killed someone. Why do you have to be so unreasonable?” ”

Hearing this.

Everyone nodded in agreement. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

They felt that what Mu Yourong said was very reasonable.

A true daughter was a true daughter!

She was magnanimous!

“Hearing everyone’s praise, Mu Yourong felt extremely happy. She had finally regained her lost ground. ”

Ye Zao’s expression didn’t change. He casually picked up the wine on the buffet table and poured it over Mu Yourong.

No one had expected ye Zao to suddenly do this!

Mu Yourong was stunned by this sudden scene!

She only felt that her chest was sticky.

It was obvious that she was in a terrible state.

“What are you doing!”Xu Jiao shouted.

“Ye Zao shrugged slightly. “Oh, sorry, my hand slipped. I didn’t mean it. Don’t be angry, Miss Mu!” ”

“What do you mean by ‘my hand slipped’? You did it on purpose!”Xu Jiao couldn’t contain her anger.

“Ye Zao looked down at Xu Jiao, his eyes sparkling, “Everyone makes mistakes. I’ve apologized to her and even killed her with my head on the ground. Miss Xu, Miss Mu, why do you have to be so unreasonable?” ”

She repeated what Mu Yourong had said to them.

“Xu Jiao stood where she was, her face alternately red and white. ”

She had never expected ye Zao to turn the tables on her!

She had never expected ye Zao to be so eloquent.
