“”Yes, Miss Ye.”The assistant nodded. ”

“Soon, the assistant came over with a glass of water. “Team leader Cen, have some water.” ”

Cen Hu took the glass with both hands. “Thank you.”

“After drinking some water, Cen Hu’s condition improved a lot. He continued, “Miss Ye, the old lady of the Feng family has passed away!” ”

“Ye Zhuo frowned slightly. When she saw the old lady the day before yesterday, the old lady was still in good spirits. Why did she suddenly pass away? ”

Or did she hear wrongly?

“You mean Feng Qi’s mother?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“Yes.”Cen Hu nodded. “It’s her! The Internet has turned upside down. Don’t you know?”

Ye Zhuo was studying the secrets hidden in the plain jade and did not pay attention to the matters on the internet.

“”I don’t know.”Ye Zhuo continued, “What exactly is going on?” ”

“Cen Hu continued, “The police said that the old man poisoned Feng Ying and then poisoned himself!” ”

Poisoned himself.

“Hearing these words, Ye Zhuo was a little shocked. ”

She never thought that the old man would do such a thing.

The old man was so righteous and loyal to the country. How could he have such a daughter and granddaughter?

“If a person had not walked into a dead end, he would never have brought the people closest to him to commit suicide by taking poison. ”

The old lady’s behavior shocked Ye Zhuo.

“In front of the nation’s righteousness and her only family member, the old lady resolutely chose to defend her country. This behavior was truly admirable! ”

“The old lady could have chosen to go to country C with Feng Ying to enjoy her old age, but she did not do so. This kind of spirit was worthy of everyone to learn from. ”

“If it was anyone else, it would be difficult for them to do what the old lady did. ”

“Ye Zhuo sighed softly and turned to look at Cen Hu. He then said, “I’ll go out for a while. You’ll be in charge of the experiment for the time being.” ”

“”Alright, Miss Ye. Don’t worry, leave it to me.” ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and went to the isolation room. He changed out of his isolation suit and left in a hurry.

“Twenty minutes later, a handsome Maybach stopped at the entrance of the police station. ”

“Ten minutes later, ye Zao walked out of the police station and drove to the hospital. ”

The old lady’s body was still kept in the morgue.

“The staff brought ye Zao to the third underground floor and pulled out a large drawer. “Miss Ye, this is the old man who was sent here a few days ago, Feng Shujing.” ” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“The moment the drawer was pulled open, the old man could be seen lying quietly in the freezer. His face was peaceful. Although it had been refrigerated in low temperature, ye Zao could immediately tell that she had consumed a lethal poison called the heart of a femme fatale! ”

“Once this poison invaded the human body, it would quickly spread, leaving only ten minutes for the person. ”

“In other words, the person had to consume the antidote within ten minutes. Otherwise, even if a god descended to the mortal world, he would not be able to reverse the situation! ”

“What about Feng Ying’s?”Ye Zao continued to ask.

“The manager looked at Ye Zao and was a little surprised. He had worked here for more than twenty years, and rarely had there been a young girl who dared to come to see a corpse alone. Moreover, no young girl could be so calm when facing a corpse! ”

Many girls were already scared out of their wits before they even stepped into the morgue.

“Not to mention girls, even a man would be shocked when faced with a corpse in the freezer. ”

“After all, the bodies that could be placed in the hospital morgue did not die of natural causes. Bodies that did not die of natural causes were more or less terrifying! ”

“Take this old lady for example. Although she looked quite peaceful, there was a sense of strangeness in the peaceful room that made people panic. ”

“The administrators had been working in the hospital mortuary for nearly 10 years, but when they saw the old lady’s body, they were also a little afraid. ”

“”The younger girl was taken to the funeral parlor after the volunteers finished the procedures!”Because the old lady was labeled as a wolf grandmother and a ruthless person, the people despised her endlessly, they wished that the old lady would be sealed in the hospital mortuary forever! ”

“A few days earlier, there were even people who rushed to the hospital’s mortuary to scold the old lady! ”

The administrator looked pitiful and lied that the old lady was not in the hospital.

The administrator was in his fifties this year. He was someone who had become someone else’s grandfather. He knew that there would not be a grandmother in this world who would poison her granddaughter for no reason!

There must be a story hidden in this.

Unfortunately.

The netizens were too impulsive!

“Then, the old lady had no other relatives in the world, and no one was willing to take care of her funeral, so her body could only be frozen in the hospital morgue. ”
