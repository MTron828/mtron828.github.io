“Song Chenyu’s expression turned ugly for a moment, but it quickly returned to normal. She looked up at ye Zao and said, “So it turns out that miss ye is the real expert! I should be the one asking miss ye for advice.” ”

“Ye Zao smiled faintly and said, “A dangerous thing like a dart is not suitable for a delicate flower like miss song to play with.” ”

Old Mrs. Cen covered her mouth and laughed secretly.

Song Chenyu was still far from her precious granddaughter-in-law.

“Cen Yueying looked at Old Mrs. Cen and said in confusion, “Grandma, just laugh. Why are you covering your mouth?” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen said, “I’m afraid that I’ll laugh my fake teeth off.” ” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Cen Yueying:”...”

“Hearing this, song Chenyu’s expression remained the same, but the hand hidden in his sleeve shook and shook. ”

“She was not a fool, so she naturally understood what ye Zao meant. ”

“In her life, she had never lost to anyone. ”

Especially those of the same sex.

“She lived like a female lead in a TV series. She had the aura of a female lead, and she could do whatever she wanted. There was nothing that she could not get. ”

“However, ever since ye Zao appeared, everything had changed. ”

“In just half a year’s time, she had fallen on ye Zao several times. ”

“First, it was a race car. ”

“Now, it was a dart. ”

Was Ye Zao that powerful?

What did ye Zao have?

She didn’t believe that she couldn’t win against ye Zao!

“At this moment, a well-dressed curly-haired woman walked to ye Zao’s side, “Hello, Miss Ye. I’m Zhou Xiaowan. I’ve watched your live broadcast of chess on the fast track platform before. I’m your loyal fan. I didn’t expect to see you in person today!” ”

“”Thank you for liking it,”ye Zao’s tone was indifferent. ”

“Cen Yuyan walked over and looked at Zhou Xiaowan in surprise. “Xiaowan, so you like Zao Zao Too?” ”

“Zhou Xiaowan, Cen Yuyan, and song Chenyu were very close. ”

She was the same as Cen Yuyan. They both felt that a great beauty like song Chenyu should be Cen Shaoqing.

“Song Chenyu and Cen Shaoqing were about to become a couple, but ye Zao interfered. This made Zhou Xiaowan have a bad impression of ye Zao. ”

She felt that ye Zao was a third party.

“Zhou Xiaowan nodded and continued, “Miss Ye’s go skills are very good! I like her very much! I also admire her go skills very much.” ”

Ye Zao’s lips curled up slightly.

The fans who really liked her would not call her ‘Miss Ye’. It was just that she was too lazy to expose Zhou Xiaowan right now.

“Not only did she not want to expose her, but she was also very curious about what Zhou Xiaowan and Cen Yuyan were up to. ”

It just so happened that they were quite bored at the moment.

Why not play with them.

Cen Yuyan was even more surprised when she heard this. “So you also know how to play chess?”

“En.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“CEN Yuyan continued, “Chenyu also knows how to play chess. What a coincidence!” ”

“Zhou Xiaowan smiled and said, “Yuyan, look, if you didn’t say anything, I would have forgotten that Chenyu also knows how to play chess!” ”

“Not only did song Chenyu know how to play chess, but he was also an expert among experts. ”

Her grandfather was also the president of the Chess Association.

“Song Chenyu, who had grown up in a chess family, was naturally not too bad. Moreover, song Chenyu had extraordinary talent. ”

“At the age of thirteen, song Chenyu was first place in Liancheng’s third chess competition. ”

Unless song Chenyu did not want to participate in the competition.

Any competition that song Chenyu had participated in would definitely win first place!

“As soon as she finished speaking, Zhou Xiaowan continued, “Then why don’t we let Searing Flame compete with Chenyu? It just so happens that all of us are quite bored now.” ”

“Chess competition?”Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly. “Are you sure?”

“Cen Yuyan nodded and said in disbelief, “Searing flame, don’t tell me you don’t dare to play with Chenyu?”Although ye Zao’s chess skills had already reached the grandmaster level in the live broadcast world. ”

But that was only in the live broadcast world.

Who knew if ye searing had cheated during the live broadcast?

It was normal for ye searing not to dare to let ye searing and song Chenyu PK Go Skills Face to face today!

“I’ll accompany you at any time.”Ye searing’s brows and eyes were still the same.

A proud expression flashed across Cen Yuyan’s eyes.

She had originally thought that ye searing would know the difficulty and retreat.

She did not expect ye searing to be a person without discernment and actually agreed.

Then she would be crushed by song Chenyu!

She did not know where ye Zao got his confidence from.

“Even if ye Zao did not cheat during the live broadcast, she would not be able to win against song Chenyu. ”

“After all, Song Chenyu was born into a chess family. ”

His starting point was different.

How could she compete with Song Chenyu?

She really overestimated herself!
