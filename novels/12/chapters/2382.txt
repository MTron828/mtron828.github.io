Chapter 2383: 498: Why did they ignore ye Zao? 1

Translator: 549690339

Bai Jingshu was Bai Mo’s cousin.

“Under normal circumstances, when a cousin got married, how could they not invite their cousin? ”

“Moreover, when Bai Jingshu saw Bai Mo, she still had a stunned expression on her face. ”

This scene caused the other relatives and friends present to be a little dumbfounded.

They felt that there was something going on.

“Wu Mei quietly tugged on ye Shu’s sleeve and asked in a low voice, “What’s Going On?” ”

Ye Shu shook her head slightly. “I don’t know what’s going on either.”

“After saying that, ye Shu added, “But this girl has been on a blind date with Ah Ze before.” ”

‘been on a blind date?’?

“Upon catching these three words, Wu Mei’s face was filled with gossip. At the wedding venue, her previous blind date came to congratulate her, and she even addressed the bride as her sister. ”

The amount of information was simply too much!

“”Then, did ah ze have a relationship with her?”Wu Mei continued to ask. ”

“If the two of them still had a relationship, then things might be a little tricky. ”

“Wu Mei had attended a wedding banquet before. The boy’s ex-girlfriend directly played the intimate video of them at the wedding, and the bride left in anger. ”

“Today, Lin Ze’s wedding wouldn’t have the same farce, right? ”

“Ye Shu shook her head. “No, the two of them haven’t even started yet.” ”

“That’s good.”Wu Mei looked at Bai mo. “But why do I feel that this little girl has come with ill intentions? Are you sure there’s nothing going on between Ah Ze and her?”

“No matter how she looked at it, it looked like she was here to pick a fight. ”

“It was also because of this reason that Bai Jingshu pretended that she had never known that Bai Mo had come to Earth, and she had not been invited to the wedding. ”

“Yet, Bai Mo still came. ”

“No matter how she looked at it, it did not seem right! ”

“Ye Shu nodded, “It’s really nothing! “This little girl is Jingshu’s cousin. She rejected ah ze previously because she thought that Ah Ze was born in an ordinary family. Later, she found out Ah Ze’s true identity and saw Jingshu marrying Ah Ze, so she felt uneasy!” ”

“”I see!”Wu Mei had been in the rich and powerful family for many years and had seen all kinds of women. However, this was the first time she had seen a woman like bai mo. “This little girl is quite capable!” ”

She had rejected Lin Ze and now regretted that she had come to the wedding uninvited. Ordinary people would not be so thick-skinned.

She wondered what this little girl was thinking!

“Bai Jingshu quickly reacted and said with a smile, “If sister is here to bless us, then as your elder sister, I will naturally welcome you.” ”

“However, if she was not here to bless them, she would naturally not give Bai Mo face. ” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Bai Mo said, “It’s good that you’re welcoming me. I thought that sister would not welcome me.” ”

“”How can that be?”One would never hit a smiling person, let alone in front of so many guests. ”

“At this moment, Bai Jingshu could only accept Bai Mo’s blessings. ”

She had a premonition.

Bai Mo had definitely come here with a purpose.

“”Sister, this is a wedding gift that I specially prepared for you.”After saying that, Bai Mo handed over a red gift box with both hands. ”

“Just as Bai Jingshu was about to reach out to receive it, a pair of fair and slender hands took the gift box from BAI MO. “I’ll thank you on behalf of my sister-in-law, second Miss Bai.” ”

Bai Mo looked at the beautiful woman in front of her and was stunned.

“The person in front of her was wearing a nude pink bridesmaid’s dress. There was no makeup on her face, but her lips were red and her teeth were white. Her 3,000 strands of black hair were braided diagonally, and the nude pink ribbon on her head added to her charm, looking down, it was a beautiful collarbone. ”

“The strapless gown covered the boundless spring color, faintly revealing a bewitching charm. ”

This was...

Ye Zao.

“She had heard of many things about ye Zao. She had met ye Zao once before. Although they had never worked together, she knew that ye Zao was not someone to be trifled with. ”

“After all, he was someone who could calm down the people of the Chang Yue country by himself. ”

“If the Chang Yue country did not have ye Zao, they would be a pile of loose sand by now. ”

“Bai Mo had thought of many ways to deal with it when she came, but she had only forgotten about ye Zao. ”

What should she do now?

“If she asked him to give up just like that, she would definitely be unwilling. ”

But if he did not give up...

It seemed that she could only wait and find a suitable opportunity to give Bai Jingshu a fatal blow.

“Thinking of this, Bai Mo narrowed his eyes. ”

“Bai Mo secretly bit her lower lip and continued, “Miss Ye, you’re too polite. This is what a younger sister like me should do.” ”

“Ye Zhuo handed the gift box to the butler beside him and instructed, “Bring second Miss Bai to the VIP seats.” ”

“”Okay.”The butler nodded and turned to look at Bai mo. “Second Miss Bai, please.” ”
