“Silly.”Zhou Rui turned around and kissed Cen Yuyan.

“It was also at this time that Zhou Rui realized that Cen Yuyan’s face was injured. He hurriedly asked, “Yuyan, what happened to your face? Who bullied you?” ”

“It’s nothing. I applied the medicine. It’s almost done.”Cen Yuyan said indifferently.

“Zhou Rui said, “Tell me who bullied you. I’ll go and avenge you now!” ”

Cen Yuyan looked at Zhou Rui. “It’s my grandmother.”

“When he heard that it was old madam Cen, Zhou Rui felt as if someone had poured a bucket of cold water on him. “Why did she hit you? Was it because of me?” ”

“CEN Yuyan said, “It wasn’t all because of you.” ”

Zhou Rui was stunned.

Cen Yuyan explained song Chenyu’s matter to him.

“Zhou Rui narrowed his eyes and said, “It seems that your future sister-in-law isn’t someone easy to deal with.” ”

“”What future sister-in-law? Who would acknowledge her future sister-in-law!”CEN Yuyan continued, “Only Chenyu is my future sister-in-law!” ”

“Miss Song?”Zhou Rui asked.

Cen Yuyan nodded.

Zhou Rui did not expect that song Chenyu was targeting fifth master cen.

He even dared to have designs on Fifth Master Cen.

His appetite was not small.

“However, if song Chenyu could really marry into the CEN family, it would not be a bad thing for him. ”

“Zhou rui continued, “Then can fifth master take a liking to miss song? I think his relationship with Ye Zhuo is still very unusual!” ”

“Moreover, Ye Zao was many times more beautiful than song Chenyu. ”

Anyone with a discerning eye would know that ye Zao should be chosen.

“”Acting.”CEN Yuyan said directly, “My fifth brother doesn’t like her at all. He’s just acting for my grandmother. If my grandmother wasn’t around, my fifth brother would definitely dump her immediately!” ”

Old Mrs. Cen was already in her eighties and was almost ninety years old this year. How many years could she live?

One Year?

Two years?

It was only a matter of time before ye Zhuo was dumped.

“Luckily, old Mrs. Cen didn’t have many years left. If she lived another ten or twenty years, who in the Cen family could stand her? ”

Cen Yuyan only wanted Old Mrs. Cen to see the King of Hell Right now.

“Although she knew that this kind of thought was quite vicious, it was old Mrs. Cen’s fault for being so blind. ”

Such a blind person would only delay others and waste the air in the world.

“Zhou Rui frowned without leaving a trace and continued, “You mean that your fifth brother doesn’t like ye Zao at all, and all of this is because of your grandmother?” ”

“Yes.”Cen Yuyan nodded.

“Hearing this, Zhou Rui knew in his heart. ”

“At first, he was still worried that if Cen Shaoqing married ye Zao and had a child in the future, he would compete with them for the family property. ”

“But now, it seemed that this question was completely unnecessary. ”

Because Cen Shaoqing did not like ye Zao at all.

All of this was an illusion!

“In the future, he did not have to worry about these problems at all. ”

“The corner of Zhou Rui’s mouth curled up into a smile. He turned to look at the kitchen and continued, “The medicine seems to be ready. I’ll go take a look.” ”

The medicine was indeed ready.

“Zhou Rui scooped out a bowl and carried it to the living room. He blew on it carefully to make sure that it had become cold before handing it to Cen Yuyan. He then said, “The medicine is already cold. Drink slowly. I’ll go get you some sugar.” ”

Cen Yuyan took the bowl and took a sip. The taste was very bitter and it was difficult to swallow.

“But when she thought about how Zhou Rui had painstakingly brewed the medicine for her, she should not let Zhou Rui down, so she gritted her teeth and drank all the medicine. ”

“When she finished drinking the medicine, Zhou Rui immediately handed her the sugar. “Yuyan, eat the sugar.” ”

Cen Yuyan ate a piece of sugar before the bitter taste in her mouth dissipated a little.

Ding Dong.

“At this moment, Cen Yuyan received a text message on her phone. ”

“Cen Yuyan picked up her phone and frowned, her face filled with impatience. ”

“Zhou Rui asked curiously, “Who sent this message?” ”

“”My mother,”Cen Yuyan replied. ” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Auntie sent this message?”Zhou Rui’s eyes lit up.

He knew that the Cen family would not give up on Cen Yuyan so easily.

“The Cen family’s three older sisters had already married off, and the daughter that had married off had thrown a bucket of water. ”

“Cen Shaoqing was also an unmarried person, and an unmarried person had to have no descendants. ”

“In the future, the CEN family would rely on Cen Yuyan to support them! ”

How could they really chase Cen Yuyan out of the house.

“Zhou Rui continued, “Why is Auntie looking for you?” ”

“Cen Yuyan said, “She said she wanted to talk to me.” ”

“Zhou Xiang had disappointed Cen Yuyan too much today, and Cen Yuyan did not want to see Zhou Xiang now. ”

“Zhou Rui saw through Cen Yuyan’s thoughts and continued, “You don’t want to see Auntie?” ”

“Yes.”Cen Yuyan nodded.

“Zhou Rui put his arm around Cen Yuyan’s shoulder and said earnestly, “Go. She’s your mother after all. Even if she’s not good, you were still born in her womb for ten months. If it weren’t for her, there wouldn’t be the current you.” ”
