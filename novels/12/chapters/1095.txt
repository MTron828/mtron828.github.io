Translator: 549690339

Ye Zao was the first and the last.

“Then, Dr. Warne asked, “By the way, Miss Ye, I have another question for you.” ”

“Go ahead.”

Dr. Warne turned on the computer. “Look here.”

“Ye Zao sat in front of the computer. In less than ten seconds, he solved the problem on the computer. ”

Dr. Warne was stunned.

Ye Zao had moved too fast. He had just started to look at it and it was already over.

“Just as Dr. Warne was stunned, ye Zao continued, “Actually, this is very simple. It’s just that you think it’s too difficult. I’ll send the formula to your email later. You’ll understand after taking a look.” ”

“”Okay.”Dr. Warne nodded. “Then I’ll have to trouble you, Miss Ye.” ”

Ye Zao stood up from his chair. “You’re welcome. I’ll be going back first.”

Dr. Warne stood up to send ye Zao off.

“Just as he pushed open the office door, he saw a jade-like figure standing outside. ”

She was tall and straight.

She was like an orchid and a jade tree.

“Her posture was casual, but her body exuded an unapproachable aura. ”

“Master Five.”Dr. Warne hurriedly walked forward to greet him.

Cen Shaoqing turned slightly. “Dr. Warne.”

Ye Zhuo walked to Cen Shaoqing’s side. “Let’s go back.”

“Is everything done?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Cen Shaoqing turned around to greet Dr. Warne, then left with Ye Zhuo. ”

Dr. Warne watched the two of them leave the base before turning around to return to his office.

In the underground garage.

“Cen Shaoqing left the car door as he looked back at Ye Zhuo. “Where are you going for dinner tonight, leader?” ”

“Ye Zhuo hesitated for a moment. “Let’s go to the little southern kingdom, shall we?” ”

“Sure.”Cen Shaoqing started the engine.

8 pm.

“It was the peak time for dinner, and the little southern kingdom was packed with people. ”

“Cen Shaoqing and Ye Zhuo had just stepped into the shop when they were noticed by the sharp-eyed lobby manager. He immediately went up to them and greeted, “Master five! Miss Ye!” ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“The lobby manager continued, “Are the two of you still in your usual seats?” ”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddha beads.

“Please follow me.”The lobby manager led the way.

Ye Zao was a regular customer of this shop. He ordered the dishes without even looking at the menu.

“Not long after, the waiter came up with the dishes. Just as he was about to place them in front of ye Zao, ye Zao said, “Just place this plate of grass in front of him.” ”

“The waiter was stunned for a moment, but he quickly reacted and placed the salad in front of Cen Shaoqing. ”

“Ye Zao rested his chin on one hand and looked at Cen Shaoqing. “You eat grass every day. Can you keep up with your stamina?”Although Cen Shaoqing had no restrictions on meat and vegetables since he was with her, his daily staple food was still green leafy vegetables. ”

“”Don’t worry, my stamina is very good.”Cen Shaoqing picked up a tissue and slowly wiped his mouth. “Especially my waist.” ”

The last word was meaningful.

“Waist?”Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly. “Does having a good stamina have anything to do with your waist?”

“Do you know what is the root of a harmonious family?”Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads and asked.

“What?”

Cen Shaoqing looked at ye Zao and opened his thin lips slightly. “Say less and do more.”

“If his waist was not good, how could he say less and do more? ”

“Ye Zhuo frowned slightly, feeling a little dizzy from Cen Shaoqing’s teasing. ”

Cen Shaoqing picked up a piece of chicken and placed it into ye Zhuo’s bowl. “Hurry up and eat.”

“Why is it that saying less and doing more is the foundation of a harmonious family? Say Less and do more?”There weren’t any difficult problems that could trouble ye Zhuo. This was the first time.

“She had never been in a relationship in her previous life, let alone been married. She was just a noob when it came to love. ” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Cen Shaoqing’s tone was slightly somber. “You’ll know in the future.”

Practice makes perfect.

Ye Zao did not ask any more questions. He would find out one day anyway.

...

Ye Zao would return to the Financial World Tomorrow.

The happiest person was none other than elder Zhang.

He had been waiting for this day for too long.

“All these years, the Zhao family had always been the sole power of the Shunxi Financial Group. He thought that before he closed his eyes, he would not be able to see the Shunxi Financial Group on the right track. ”

The heavens did not disappoint those who had good intentions.

“Finally, he had waited for this day. ”

“In order to celebrate, elder Zhang specially went to the temple to burn incense and pray to the Buddha. ”

“At 9:30 pm, elder Zhang returned from the temple. ”

“Elder Zhang had disappeared in the morning and had not returned until now. Cao Wei was extremely anxious, afraid that something would happen to elder Zhang. ”

“At this moment, Cao Wei suddenly saw a figure walk in from outside the door. He hurriedly ran over. The dim yellow street lamp shone on elder Zhang’s face. Cao Wei’s eyes lit up and he said excitedly, “Elder Zhang! You’re finally back!” ”
