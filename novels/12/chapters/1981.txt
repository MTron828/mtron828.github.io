Translator: 549690339

“They called Xu Chaonan countless times, but no one picked up. ”

...

Chang Yue.

Qiu Di opened the door to the detention room again.

The room was filled with the smell of blood.

“Yi Ling was half-dead and lying on the transparent glass wall. When she saw someone come in, she raised her eyelids. ”

Did Ye Zao Come to save it?

No...

No.

“When she saw that it was Qiu Di, Yi Ling lowered her eyelids again. ”

“”Yi Ling, you should have thought it through by now, right? A wise man submits to circumstances. Now, only I can make you and give you a way out.” ”

“Ye Zao was dead. In the future, she was the only savior of Chang Yue. ”

“”I’m not afraid of death.”Yi Ling’s voice was very weak. “Bad woman, come and do whatever you want. As long as I’m not dead, I believe that one day, Miss Ye will come and save me.” ”

“Ye Zao has already turned into ashes.”The corner of Qiu Di’s lips curled up.

“”No!”Hearing this, Yi Ling flapped her wings with all her might and crashed straight into the glass wall, leaving a bloody mark on the wall. “Miss Ye will not die! It will come and save me! Definitely!” ”

Not dead.

Ye Zao was not dead.

Ye Zao was so powerful that he single-handedly defeated a nine-legged beast. Even the Zerg were afraid of her.

How could such a person die in an experiment?

No.

It would not.

It did not believe it. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Yi Ling clenched her teeth tightly. “Miss Ye will come.”

“Hahaha!”Qiu Di laughed out loud. “You expect a dead person to save you? That’s simply impossible!”

Pa da —

“As she had used up all her strength, Yi Ling directly slid down from the transparent wall. ”

Qiu Di curled the corners of her lips and asked someone to bring in a plate of fragrant hundred spirit fruit.

This hundred spirit fruit was Yi Ling’s favorite food.

“Upon smelling the fragrance of the hundred spirit fruit, Yi Ling felt as if all the cells in her body were dancing. ”

She had been starving for three months.

“During these three months, Qiu Di had only sent a little food to keep her alive so that she wouldn’t starve to death. ”

“Ever since ye Zhuo disappeared, it had not eaten any more hundred spirit fruits. ”

“At this moment, Yi Ling wished she could finish the plate of hundred spirit fruits in one go. ”

It was really hungry.

So Hungry.

“Autumn flute held the hundred spirit fruit in her hand and continued, “Form a contract with me. From now on, I will let you eat the hundred spirit fruit every day.” ”

“”PFFT, I don’t want it,”Yi Ling said. ”

“You really don’t want it?”Autumn flute threw the hundred spirit fruit to the pet monkey beside her.

The pet monkey immediately took the hundred spirit fruit and started munching on it.

It was really enjoying it.

Yi Ling swallowed her saliva as she watched.

Qiu Di opened the glass door and placed a hundred spirit fruit in front of Yi Ling. “Do you want to eat it? This one is for you!”

“Hearing this, Yi Ling’s eyes lit up and she immediately opened her mouth to take it. However, the next second, Qiu Di took the hundred spirit fruit away. “Dream On! Yi Ling, if you want to eat the hundred spirit fruit, form a contract with me!” ”

“Yi Ling turned her head away, no longer looking at Qiu Di and that Annoying Monkey. ”

That monkey seemed to have seen through Yi Ling’s thoughts. It jumped in front of Yi Ling and purposely ate it for her to see.

Yi Ling turned her head away again.

She was really hungry.

“This kind of feeling could not be described with boring words. At this moment, Yi Ling wished that she could eat a huge mountain. ”

“Seeing that Yi Ling still dared to ignore the pet monkey.., ”

“qiu di frowned tightly. He reached out and pulled back Yi Ling’s head. He said fiercely, “Little Bastard, I told you to watch it!” ”

Yi Ling was forced to watch the pet monkey eat.

“Ye Zhuo is already dead! Dead!”

Qiu Di glared fiercely at Yi Ling. The expression on his face was extremely terrifying. It was incomparably sinister and made people’s scalps go numb.

Dead.

Ye Zhuo had died a long time ago.

Ye Zao was a slut.

“In the past, when he was alive, it affected her. Now that he was dead, it still affected her. ”

“At this moment, Qiu Di wanted nothing more than to grind ye Zao’s bones and scatter his ashes. ”

“Yi Ling said angrily, “He’s not dead! Da Zao Zao won’t Die! She Won’t Die!” ”

Ye Zao would never die!

Bang!

Qiu Di directly slapped him.

Pu.

“Yi Ling was already covered in injuries. At this moment, she directly spat out a mouthful of blood. ”

The pain was unbearable.

“But even so, Yi Ling still felt that ye Zao was not dead. She raised her head and looked at Qiu Di, “Bad woman, as long as you don’t kill me, Da Zao will definitely come and save me! In My Heart, you will never be comparable to da Zao. You are not even comparable to a single finger of hers!” ”

“Do you really think that I don’t dare to kill you?”Qiu Di looked at Yi Ling.

“”Do you dare?”Yi ling smiled and said, “If you dare, if you have the guts, kill me now! You Don’t dare to kill me because you still want to rely on me to make everyone submit to you! Qiu Di, you don’t dare! Qiu Di, you are a coward!” ”
