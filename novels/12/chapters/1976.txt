Translator: 549690339

“One day, she will make this old thing pay. ”

Two hours later.

The doctor came out with the results.

“He ziteng immediately rushed over and asked, “Doctor Yang, how is it?” ”

“Doctor Yang looked at the results and said, “Mr. HE, according to the results, you are indeed the biological father of Miss Xu’s Child!” ”

What?

Biological Father!

He ziteng was stunned.

No.

Impossible.

Xu Yao and Mi Chen clearly had an improper relationship. How could he be the biological father of that bastard child!

It couldn’t be.

“When she heard this, a glint flashed across Xu Yao’s lowered eyes. ”

He ziteng had never expected that she was carrying his biological child.

“Fortunately, she was careful. ”

Otherwise...

“At this moment, Mi Chen stepped forward. “Ziteng, the truth is right in front of you. Do you still think that the child in Xu Yao’s stomach is mine?” ”

He ziteng was stunned on the spot. He felt as if the world was spinning.

How did things turn out like this?

“When they heard this, the He family’s parents walked to Xu Yao’s side and said with guilt on their faces, “Yaoyao, I’m sorry. We misunderstood you and Doctor Mi.” ”

Xu Yao’s eyes were red and she didn’t say anything.

“After saying that, the He family’s parents looked at Mi Chen. “Doctor Mi, I’m sorry.” ”

“Mi Chen said with a clear conscience, “Uncle and Auntie, I’ve said long ago that it’s unnecessary to do the test. I’m fine. You guys should care more about Xu Yao! I think she’s in a very bad state right now!” ”

“After saying that, Mi Chen turned to look at he ziteng and continued, “Ziteng, you’ve just woken up. The most important thing now is to cultivate properly. As for what you’ve heard, it’s really just a figment of your imagination!” ”

“”Dad, Mom, don’t be fooled by them!”He ziteng reacted at that moment, “I really don’t have a figment of my imagination. That’s Not a dream! “Mi Chen and Xu Yao really knew each other a long time ago. Mi Chen was the one who caused my car accident! “Oh right, I remember now. When Xu Yao went to the hospital for a pregnancy test, Mi Chen was the one who drove us there. Mi Chen must have done something to the car at that time! “I also heard him tell Xu Yao that once the car’s speed reaches 210 or above, the brakes will fail!” ”

He ziteng was very anxious now.

He did not understand why his parents did not believe him.

He was even more confused as to why the child in Xu Yao’s stomach would be his.

The He parents only thought that he ziteng was hallucinating.

“Father he walked to he ziteng’s side and continued, “Ziteng, doctor mi is right. You have just woken up and you still need to rest well. Please don’t say too much!” ”

“After he said that, father he looked at Mi Chen. “Doctor Mi, I’m sorry.” ”

“Mi Chen said, “Uncle, don’t worry. I Won’t argue with a patient.” ”

Patient!

“When he saw Mi Chen’s smug face, he ziteng finally couldn’t hold it in any longer. He rushed over and grabbed mi chen by her collar. His eyes widened and his face was filled with anger. “Mi Chen! You Bastard!” ”

“At that moment, he ziteng even wanted to perish together with Mi Chen. ”

He really couldn’t stand the people who had harmed him. They pretended to be innocent in front of his parents.

“Mi Chen looked at he ziteng and said, “Ziteng, you’ve really misunderstood! I really didn’t do those things!” ”

Bang!

He ziteng raised his hand and punched Mi Chen.

“In an instant, a bruise appeared on Mi Chen’s left eye. ”

“Seeing this, the He family’s parents immediately went forward and grabbed he ziteng. “Ziteng! What are you doing!”After saying that, they apologized to Mi Chen. “Doctor Mi, I’m sorry! Ziteng isn’t in his right mind right now. He didn’t do it on purpose!” ” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“”Dad, Mom, let go of me. I want to kill that bastard!” ”

“Mi Chen took off her broken eye, “He ziteng, don’t think that you can do whatever you want just because you’re sick! You said that I did those things that were not true. Do you have evidence? If you don’t have evidence, I can sue you for slander!” ”

“”Who said that he doesn’t have evidence?”In the next second, the door of the ward was pushed open. ”

A slender figure walked in from outside the door.

“The person who came was tall and slender. She wore a dark green linen shirt and white leggings. She was clearly dressed very plainly, but an aura of nobility that could not be replicated erupted from her body. ”

This was...

Ye Zao?

“Seeing ye Zao, he ziteng’s eyes instantly lit up. ”

Goddess!

His goddess had finally arrived.

“No matter what time it was, as long as ye Zao was here, it would make people feel at ease. ”

Ye Zhuo also followed behind a few uniformed police officers.
