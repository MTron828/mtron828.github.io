Especially Xie Rongle.

“She felt that she had been wronged. She had clearly done nothing but stand together with Xie Wanqiu and Zheng Wanyin, yet she had been scolded like a dog. ”

“If it wasn’t for the sake of marrying Zhou Jinbei, she wouldn’t have been able to bear this injustice. ”

“Xie wanqiu held Xie Rongle and Zheng Wanyin’s hands. “Rongle, yinyin, if you can’t bear it, you’ll mess up the big plan. Just Wait, one day, we’ll make them all regret it!” ”

The Cen family was the number one family in China.

“Once Zheng Wanyin married Cen Shaoqing, Zheng Wanyin would be the most honorable woman in the world. ”

“When that time came, who wouldn’t suck up to Zheng Wanyin? ”

Zheng Wanyin nodded.

Xie rongle nodded as well

“Soon, the elevator came down again. ”

The three of them walked into the elevator and pressed the button for the floor.

“Soon, the elevator door opened. ”

Zheng Wanyin opened the door and walked in.

“After entering the room, Xie wanqiu said, “Yinyin, find me a long cloth strip!” ”

“Why do you need a long cloth strip?”Zheng Wanyin asked doubtfully.

Xie wanqiu narrowed her eyes. “Hang myself!”

“Zheng Wanyin was stunned at first, but then she quickly reacted. “I don’t have a long cloth strip. Can I use clothes?” ”

“”Yes.”Xie wanqiu nodded and continued, “Remember to shoot a video for Zhou Zuolong later!” ”

She did not believe that Zhou Zuolong would remain indifferent after seeing her hang herself.

“Got it!”

Xie wanqiu took out a dress and hung it on the steel pipe in the bathroom as if she was hanging herself.

“Zheng Wanyin took out her phone to shoot the video and cried, “Grandpa, Look! Grandma said that she wants to show her determination with her death. If you still don’t come, Grandma will really hang herself!” ”

“”You and Grandma have been husband and wife for so many years. You Can’t turn against each other just because of a few photos! Don’t fall into other people’s trap and do things that make the enemy happy! Grandma, I Beg You! Please, uncle and Grandma!” ”

“After taking this video, Zheng Wanyin sent the hotel address to Zhou Zuolong. ”

“Did you send it?”Xie wanqiu asked.

“”Yes.”Zheng wanyin nodded and continued, “Do you think Grandpa will really come?” ”

“”According to my understanding of him, he will be here in less than half an hour!” ”

“That’s Good!”

“Xie wanqiu continued, “I’ll rest for a while. You and Rongle go to the window to watch. When you see Zhou Zuolong enter the hotel, come and inform me immediately!” ”

“Okay.”

“After Zheng Wanyin left, Xie wanqiu took out her phone and sent Wu Youyu a message. ”

“In the blink of an eye, half an hour had passed. ”

There was still no movement from Zheng Wanyin and Xie rongle.

Xie wanqiu narrowed her eyes.

Could it be that there was a traffic jam on the road?

“Another half an hour passed. Just as Xie Wanqiu was getting anxious, Zheng Wanyin jogged over. “Grandma!” ”

Xie wanqiu’s eyes lit up. “Is Zhou Zuolong Here?”

Zheng Wanyin shook her head. “He’s not here. He didn’t reply to wechat either. Grandma... What Should we do?”

What should we do?

How would Xie wanqiu know what to do!

She was also panicking right now. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“After a while, Xie wanqiu continued, “Go and buy some sleeping pills!” ”

“Sleeping pills?”Zheng Wanyin asked.

“Xie wanqiu nodded. “Yes, it’s sleeping pills.” ”

The act of hanging herself was too fake.

“She had to make a big scene and swallow some sleeping pills to stay in the emergency room. When that time came, Zhou Zuolong would definitely not be able to sit still. ”

“But sleeping pills are prescription drugs. Where can I buy them!”Zheng Wanyin said in a very awkward manner.

“Xie wanqiu raised her head and looked at Zheng Wanyin. “Yinyin, I know you definitely have a way.” ”

“Alright.”Zheng Wanyin nodded. “I’ll give it a try.”

Zheng Wanyin arrived at the hospital.

“After a very long time, Zheng Wanyin returned to the hotel. ”

“Xie wanqiu said, “Yinyin, did you get the sleeping pills?” ”

Zheng Wanyin nodded.

“Hurry up and give them to me.”

Zheng Wanyin took out the sleeping pills and handed them to Xie wanqiu.

Xie wanqiu took the bottle and unscrewed the cap. She poured the pills out and stuffed them into her mouth.

“This behavior gave Zheng Wanyin a fright. “Grandma, you really swallowed it!” ”

“”If you didn’t really swallow it, how would it have any effect?” ”

“Zheng wanyin frowned and said, “Won’t someone die?” ”

“”No, as long as I wash my stomach in time, there won’t be a problem. I’ve checked online,”Xie wanqiu continued, “After I swallow it, don’t call 120 immediately. Remember to call after half an hour!” ”

“”Okay.”Zheng Wanyin nodded. “But, is it really okay?” ”

“”Don’t worry, silly child. There won’t be a problem.”After saying that, Xie wanqiu stuffed all the pills into her mouth and swallowed them. ”
