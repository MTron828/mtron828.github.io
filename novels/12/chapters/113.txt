Chapter 114: 077: setting people up, birthday banquet, scene 7

Ye Zhuo and Mu Yourong handed the invitations to the staff at the entrance to check, and then followed the waiters to the manor.

The song family was worthy of being the emperor of Yunjing, and the interior was decorated with extraordinary splendor.

The guests that came and went were all nobles from all over the country.

Mu Yourong looked around.

Finally, not far away, she saw the man that she hated to the bone.

He wore an ironed suit and stood in the middle of the crowd with a cigarette between his fingers. He accepted everyone’s flattery and fawning.

His pair of beautiful peach blossom eyes were slightly narrowed. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

He had a feeling of subverting all living things.

In the past, she did not know why song Shiyu liked to narrow his eyes.

Later, she found out that this was the way song Shiyu looked at the doll.

Beneath his eyes was disdain, disdain, disgust...

Mu Yourong’s final scene before her death was song Shiyu squinting his eyes. There was even a smile at the corner of his mouth. “Tsk, life sure is tough. You’re already like this and you’re still not dead!”

After song Shiyu said this, Mu Yourong closed her eyes forever.

“Miss Mu.”A pleasant male voice rang in Mu Yourong’s ear, interrupting her thoughts.

Mu Yourong raised her head and saw that it was song Shiyu.

Just like in her previous life.

Song Shiyu took the initiative to walk over and greet her.

In her previous life, she foolishly thought that song Shiyu had fallen in love with her at first sight.

Not long after, when she saw the song family’s old lady come to the Mu family to propose marriage, she foolishly thought that song Shiyu had fallen in love with her at first sight.

At that time, she was filled with fantasies about marriage.

She never imagined that from that day onwards, she would walk from heaven to Hell.

In this world, there was no such thing as love at first sight!

“Mister Song,”Mu Yourong very well concealed the fear in her eyes. “This is my sister, Ye Zao.”

In this life, song Shiyu’s prey was ye Zao.

She had no need to be afraid of Song Shiyu.

Layers of cold sweat appeared on Mu Yourong’s back.

She had originally thought that with ye Zao around, she would not be afraid of Song Shiyu anymore.

But when she saw song Shiyu again, she still could not suppress the fear that radiated from her bones.

Song Shiyu shifted his gaze to ye Zao and extended his hand towards her. “Hello, Miss Ye.”

“Hello.”Ye Zao shook his hand.

At this moment, a servant came to look for song Shiyu and whispered a few words into his ear.

Song Shiyu’s expression did not change. He turned his head to look at ye Zhuo and Mu Yourong. “I have many guests today, and I did not treat them well. I hope that the two young misses can forgive me!”

Mu Yourong did not reply, and her expression was clearly a little unnatural.

Ye Zhuo smiled slightly. “Mister Song, please do as you please.”

Song Shiyu’s peripheral vision swept past Mu Yourong. The corners of his eyes narrowed slightly, and he turned to walk in another direction.

Not long after, song Shiyu walked over again. “Miss Ye, sorry to bother you. Please follow me.”

“What’s the matter, Mister Song?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyes slightly and put down the dessert in his hand.

He had only eaten half of the very delicious dessert.

It was a pity.

Song Shiyu’s gaze fell on the dessert. It was an exquisite cherry cream cake.

“It’s old Mister Yang looking for you. He heard that Miss Ye was also at the banquet, so he specially asked me to invite Miss Ye to thank Miss Ye for saving his life.”

Ye Zao was Old Master Yang’s Savior?

Mu Yourong’s eyes widened. She thought she was hearing things.

Old Master Yang’s Savior was clearly her!

What kind of Savior was ye Zao?

It was simply a fantasy!

“Mr. Song is mistaken. The person Old Master Yang is looking for is me.”At this moment, Mu Yourong could not care about anything else and spoke directly.

What if Old Master Yang realized that ye Zhuo was not her and immediately left?

Today was already the 28th of December.

She could not wait any longer!
