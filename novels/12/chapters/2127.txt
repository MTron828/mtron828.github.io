“Upon hearing this, Mrs. Duanmu immediately said, “Fengyu!” ”

“”He didn’t come back for more than a month!”Duanmu fengyu said angrily, “He didn’t come back even after such a big thing happened to my aunt. I think he doesn’t want this family anymore!” ”

“He didn’t come back for more than a month! This is ridiculous!”Duanmu fengyu frowned deeply. “Why didn’t you tell me about this?”

Mrs. Duanmu smiled. “He’s busy.”

“Busy?”Duanmu Fengyu’s eyes were full of sarcasm. “What would he be busy with?”

Busy playing with women?

“Mrs. Duanmu continued, “Don’t talk about him. Sister, brother-in-law’s coma is only temporary. What do you plan to do if he wakes up later?”This was the most important matter. ”

“I’ve already invited the National Master and the great elder over. They will find a way.”

“The National Master and the Great Elder were already contacting the forbidden spell clan. As long as they re-sealed the forbidden spell in Cen Hai Feng’s body, he would forget everything that he had thought of previously. ”

He would no longer have to worry about Cen Hai Feng remembering them in the future!

“Apart from that, Duanmu Huang Fei did not plan to leave any threats for herself this time. ”

She wanted all of them to die!

“When she thought of this, Duanmu Huang Fei’s eyes were filled with malice and terror. ”

“When she heard this, Mrs. Duanmu nodded. “That’s good.” ”

The Imperial preceptor and the great elder had already contacted the Forbidden Arts clan.

“After hearing about Cen Hai Feng’s matter, the most senior patriarch of the Forbidden Arts clan brought two outstanding juniors and rushed to the central hospital overnight. ”

“After saying that, Mrs. Duanmu continued, “Let’s go up and see brother-in-law.” ”

“Okay.”Duanmu huangfei nodded.

The few of them went to Cen Haifeng’s ward together.

Cen Haifeng was lying on the bed and had yet to wake up.

“Duanmu huangfei held Duanmu Fengyu’s hand and said, “Fengyu, remember aunt’s words. No matter what, you have to think of yourself. When you have to be ruthless, you have to be ruthless. Don’t follow in Aunt’s footsteps.” ”

“She had thought too much for others, which was why she had fallen to this state. ”

She was probably the most embarrassed wife of the General Alliance in history.

Ridiculous.

It was simply ridiculous. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Duanmu fengyu nodded. “I understand.”

“”However, there are some things that you are not suitable to do right now,”Duanmu huangfei continued, “Wait until you take my position, then you can take action and eliminate the future trouble forever!” ”

“The two of them were aunts and nephews, and they had the same blood flowing through their bodies. How could duanmu Fengyu not know what Duanmu Huangfei meant by this sentence? He nodded and said, “Okay, Aunty, I understand.” ”

Duanmu huangfei nodded.

“The next day, the Patriarch of the Forbidden Arts clan brought his juniors to the Central Hospital. ”

The Imperial preceptor and the great elder stood at the entrance of the hospital to welcome them.

“”Clan leader Qing, long time no see!” ”

The Imperial preceptor and the great elder cupped their fists at the newcomer.

“Clan leader Qing returned the greeting and said, “Hello, these are my two disciples, Qing man and Qing Yi.” ”

Qing man and Qing Yi immediately greeted the imperial preceptor and the great elder.

“The imperial preceptor nodded, “As expected of the disciples of clan leader Qing. They are all good seedlings! Come, Let’s talk upstairs!” ”

The few of them walked upstairs together.

“When they arrived at the ward, clan leader Qing looked at Cen Haifeng who was lying on the bed and said, “Please rest assured. I will definitely re-seal the forbidden technique on Mr. Zong Meng’s body.” ”

“Then I’ll have to trouble clan leader Qing.”

“Of course.”

“When Duanmu Huang Fei arrived at the hospital, clan leader Qing had already sealed his two disciples inside. ”

Duanmu Huang Fei was a little anxious as she paced back and forth outside the ward.

“Seeing her like this, the great elder came over and comforted her, “Madam, don’t be anxious. Chief Qing is the most experienced elder in the Forbidden Arts clan. With him around, there will definitely be no problems!” ”

“I remember what you and the Imperial Preceptor told me last time! But what happened in the end?”Duanmu Huang Fei looked at the Great Elder.

“Hearing this, the great elder looked embarrassed. “It was an accident last time. Madam, I promise you that nothing like that will happen again!” ”

“”What guarantee do you have?”Duanmu Huang Fei looked at the Great Elder. “In short, I don’t want that to happen again!” ”

“The great elder nodded. “Yes, yes, yes. Don’t worry.” ”

Duanmu Huang Fei glanced at him and didn’t say anything else.

“Soon, clan leader Qing walked out of the ward. ”

Duanmu Huang Fei immediately went up to him. “How was it?”

“Clan leader Qing said, “It went very smoothly. Don’t worry. Mr. Chief won’t think about those terrible things in the future.” ”

“Okay.”Duanmu Huang Fei nodded. “Thank you for your hard work.”
