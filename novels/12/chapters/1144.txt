Ma Jiayao nodded. “Then contact her quickly.”

Zhao Xueyin took out her phone and contacted officer Wang.

This officer Wang had some friendship with Zhao Xueyin.

“When she heard that the matter was so serious that someone had died, she immediately said, “Alright, I’ll be there right away.” ”

“Zhao Xueyin continued, “Try to be as quiet as possible. Don’t alert the enemy.” ”

“If the commotion was too big, ye Zao would definitely notice. ”

“This time, she had to make sure that ye Zao could not escape! ”

“When she thought of this, Zhao Xueyin’s eyes were filled with viciousness. ”

“After thinking for a while, officer Wang continued, “Miss Zhao, are you sure that the situation is true? It would be bad if something goes wrong.” ”

The police always paid attention to real evidence when handling a case.

They couldn’t just randomly accuse innocent people.

“Zhao Xueyin said, “Officer Wang, don’t worry. I’m sure that the situation is true.” ”

Zhao Xueyin wasn’t a small fry.

“Since she was so sure, it was definitely not a lie. ”

“”Okay, I got it.” ”

“After hanging up the phone, Zhao Xueyin turned to look at Ma Jiayue. “Second aunt, I’ll go back first.” ”

“”You go ahead.”Ma Jiayue looked at Zhao Xueyin and said, “When the time comes, just don’t forget second aunt’s well-being.” ”

“Zhao Xueyin said, “Don’t worry. I Won’t forget anyone, and I Won’t forget second aunt.” ”

Ma Jiayue nodded with satisfaction. “Go back quickly.”

Zhao Xueyin picked up her bag and turned to leave.

“Looking at Zhao Xueyin’s back, Ma Jiayue’s eyes were filled with relief. ”

“Although her third sister was a short-lived ghost, the daughter she gave birth to was an outstanding one. ”

Zhao Xueyin didn’t lose out to other boys at all.

“Sooner or later, the Shunxi Financial Group would belong to Zhao Xueyin. ”

Zhao Xueyin drove all the way back to the Shunxi Financial Group.

“Because of the traffic jam, it was already 40 minutes later when she returned. ”

“Because the police station was quite far from the financial group, officer Wang hadn’t arrived when she arrived. ”

“Zhao Xueyin sat in the driver’s seat, took out a makeup mirror, and tidied her hair before getting out of the car. ”

“After getting out of the car, Zhao Xueyin went straight to the 58th floor. ”

“Just as she got off the elevator, she saw Ye Zhuo and the company’s senior manager, manager Wang, talking as they walked forward. ”

A cold smile appeared on the corner of Zhao Xueyin’s mouth.

She was proud.

She wanted to see how long ye Zhuo could be proud for.

“”President Ye, manager Wang.”Zhao Xueyin walked over to greet him. ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Manager Wang said, “Hello, Miss Zhao.” ”

“Although manager Wang was greeting her, Zhao Xueyin could feel that his attitude had changed. ”

“If it was in the past, manager Wang would have been extremely respectful to her. ”

“But now, after following behind ye Zhuo, the respect on manager Wang’s face had long disappeared. ”

All that was left was perfunctory.

A dog that relied on its power!

She wanted to see how long ye Zhuo could protect him.

“President Ye!”Secretary Aili ran over from the elevator.

“What’s Wrong?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyes slightly.

“Aili said, “There’s an aunt surnamed Wang downstairs looking for you. But she doesn’t have an appointment. Would you like to see her?” ”

“Surnamed Wang?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly.

She didn’t seem to know this person.

“Did she say what happened?”Ye Zhuo continued to ask.

“Allie shook her head. “She didn’t say that, but she seemed to be in a hurry. She even cried.” ”

Cried?

“Ye Zhuo knitted his brows without leaving a trace and continued, “Then let her in.” ”

“Okay.”Allie nodded.

She cried.

She must have died.

“Otherwise, why would auntie Wang Cry? ”

Zhao Xueyin’s lips curled up.

They were here.

They were finally here.

Zhao Xueyin picked up her phone and sent a message to officer Wang.

Officer Wang just happened to be downstairs of the Shunxi Financial Group.

“In order to let officer Wang go upstairs earlier, Zhao Xueyin specially had Annie go downstairs to pick up officer Wang and the others. ”

On the other side.

Allie brought Auntie Wang into Ye Zhuo’s office.

“”Auntie, this is our President Ye.” ”

“Auntie Wang’s eyes lit up when she saw ye Zhuo. Then, she said excitedly, “President Ye, thank you!” ”

She did not expect that the president ye that Granny Zhou mentioned was so young.

He looked like he was not even 20 years old.

He was also so good-looking.

It was just like a painting.

“After seeing her, the person who used to be very beautiful in Auntie Wang’s eyes instantly became a very ordinary person. ” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Ye Zhuo walked to Wang Sao’s side. “Auntie, do we know each other?” ”

“”You don’t know me, but I know you. It was you who prescribed the prescription to cure my wife. I came here today especially to thank you.” ”

“After the Doctor’s diagnosis, Su Qiang’s diabetes was almost cured. ”

“However, because it was too good to be true, Liu Yuan had to observe it. ”
