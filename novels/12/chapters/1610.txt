It’s a mistake!

It must be a mistake!

“With Tang Xue helping her, how could she not be accepted? ”

Bai Yun tried hard to calm herself down.

“Zou Ying looked at Bai Yun and continued, “Bai Yun, I don’t think I heard your name over there. I’ll go and report with them first!” ”

“The announcer must have carried the wrong person!”Bai Yun immediately walked into the broadcasting room.

“The door of the broadcasting room was pushed open from the outside, and the announcer inside was shocked. ”

“Who are you?”

Bai Yun adjusted her facial expression and tried to look more gentle. “Hello! I’m the examinee for this episode. My name is Bai Yun. Did you just say the wrong name? Or did you miss one?”

“The announcer said, “There are a total of fifteen candidates for this episode. I have already finished broadcasting!” ”

“Hearing this, Bai Yun could not remain calm. She said with an excited expression, “My name is Bai Yun! Bai Yun, Yun Yun, take a closer look! How can my name not be on the list!” ”

Bai Yun was already prepared to be accepted. She was really prepared to become a member of the CEN base.

She did not expect...

She did not expect the announcer to say that her name was not on the list.

Tang Xue had already promised her!

The announcer frowned slightly. “No means No. What’s wrong with you? is the studio where you came from? Get Out!”

“”It’s You! It Must Be You!”Bai Yun did not leave, instead, she took a few steps forward and walked to the announcer’s side. “It must be you who tampered with the list! I was clearly accepted! Tell me! Did you get someone to impersonate me?” ”

Yes.

It must be like that

It must have been this broadcaster who tampered with the name list.

It was simply too hateful!

“Seeing Bai Yun like this, the broadcaster immediately dialed the internal line. “The security department? Quickly send someone to the broadcast room!” ”

“”Do you know who I am? I am your Dr. Tang’s cousin! How dare you, a mere broadcaster, scheme against me! Hurry up and add my name! Otherwise, my cousin will not let you off!” ”

The broadcaster frowned slightly.

“Before ye Zao came, Tang Xue was the youngest female doctor in the base. ”

The members of the base had always had a good impression of Tang Xue.

They did not expect Tang Xue to have such an unscrupulous cousin!

Was this really Tang Xue’s sister?

“”I don’t care whose sister you are, your name is not on the list! Not to mention that you are Miss Tang’s sister, even if you are Miss Tang’s biological mother, you don’t have the right to ask me to add your name!” ”

Which member of the CEN base didn’t rely on their true talents to enter!

“According to Bai Yun’s words, she still wanted to use the back door? ”

She was really embarrassing Tang Xue!

“At this moment, the door of the broadcast room was pushed open again. ”

The head of the security team walked in with his men. “What’s going on?”

“”Captain Liu, this person is causing trouble in the broadcast room! Quickly take her out!” ” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“I’m Your Professor Tang’s cousin. Let’s see who dares to touch me today!”

“Bai Yun stood there, looking high and mighty. ”

“How could a small security team, a watchdog, be compared to Tang Xue? ”

“At this moment, two security guards stepped forward and directly controlled Bai Yun, taking her out. ”

Bai Yun’s eyes were filled with disbelief.

She never expected that these people would dare to lay their hands on her!

“”Let go of me, let go of me! Do you know who I am? I Am Dr. Tang’s cousin! If you offend me, you will regret it!” ”

Bai Yun shouted along the way and was dragged into a small dark room.

In the office.

Tang Xue was preparing the experimental tools when her assistant ran in from outside.

“”Miss Tang, the security department called. They want you to come over.” ”

Tang Xue frowned. “Security department? Did they say what it was about?”

“They didn’t say.”The assistant shook his head.

“Tang Xue put down her gloves. “Then I’ll go over first. If Bai Yun comes looking for me, you can let her sit and wait for a while.” ”

“Okay.”The assistant nodded.

“Very soon, Tang Xue arrived at the security department. ”

“”Minister Liu, why are you looking for me?” ”

Don’t underestimate minister Liu of the Security Department.

“If it were any other place, the security department would indeed be fine, but this was the CEN group’s base. ”

Everything was managed in a formal manner.

“Minister Liu came from a proper military background, and the equipment he was equipped with were all real guns and bullets, as well as meritorious deeds. ”

“”Just now, a candidate named Bai Yun caused trouble in the broadcast room and claimed to be your cousin. Come over and see if she is your cousin.” ”
