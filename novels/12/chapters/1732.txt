“Chapter 1733: 358: honestly, I’m from 200 years later, the jealous master five! 1”

“Jamila nodded and continued, “Doctor, what about Feng Qi and Ma Jianbang’s Family?” ”

“Doctor Cara narrowed his eyes, “Feng Qi and Ma Jianbang sacrificed themselves for C nation. Their families must be properly arranged and do a good job in cleaning up the aftermath. Don’t let the families who sacrificed themselves for science and technology be disappointed!”Doctor Cara was trying to stabilize the hearts of Professor Feng and director Ma’s family, he was also trying to stabilize the hearts of the other contributors to C Nation’s science and technology. ”

“If they immediately kicked Professor Feng and director Ma’s family members away now, they would definitely be criticized! ”

Who would dare to sacrifice themselves for C Nation’s science and technology industry in the future?

“After saying that, Dr. Cara continued, “In addition, there will be a memorial service to send the hero on his final journey.” ”

What did C Nation do best?

It was a face project!

“They knew what the people wanted, and they also knew what to show the people. ”

“Okay.”Jamila nodded.

“Dr. Cara lit a cigar and blew out a puff of smoke. Then, he said, “Do you think you can win YC over?” ”

“From the beginning to the end, Dr. Cara had underestimated ye Zao. ”

He had thought that ye Zao’s greatest achievement was to build a light-speed aircraft carrier and create the world’s top defense and attack systems.

But now it seemed that.

Ye Zao’s ability was far more than that.

“Ye Zao had never landed on the Europa, but she accurately predicted that danger was lurking on the Europa! ”

Stop everyone from landing!

“If he knew that ye Zao’s prediction was not wrong, he would never have agreed to Feng Qi and Ma Jianbang Landing on the Europa. ”

“If he could rope YC over, then country C would be an existence that looked down on the world. ”

“Compared to country C, China’s foundation was still too shallow. It was said that a small temple could not accommodate a big buddha. China simply could not suppress a god like YC. ”

“Before this, country C was many times stronger than China. ”

“When China still had long braids, country C had already opened a subway ”

Jamila did not say anything.

Get YC to join them? Get YC to become a citizen of Country C?

How was that possible!

“Although Jamila did not know much about YC, she knew that YC was not the kind of person who could easily betray his country. ”

“Moreover, YC was now famous and rich in China. Her honor and status were far higher than Dr. Cara’s, especially since not long ago, Dr. Cara had just lost the right to use the base of country C to YC. ”

How could YC rebel so easily now?

Dr. Cara thought this matter was too simple.

“Why aren’t you saying anything?”Dr. Cara turned to look at Jamila.

“Jamila considered the words in her heart and continued, “I don’t think YC will rebel. It’s a waste of time to work on her...” ”

“Dr. Cara narrowed her eyes. “Although she’s capable, she’s still young and a little girl. She doesn’t have much experience. Let’s work hard. What if we succeed?” ”

“Jamila still shook her head. “If YC is as simple as you think, then she wouldn’t have achieved what she has today.” ”

“After saying that, Jamila continued, “If it were an ordinary person, we could use fame or benefits in exchange. In front of YC, what do you think is suitable?” ”

She had fame.

She had benefits.

“Not only did she have fame, but she was also famous in the world. ”

“Not to mention him, even if Dr. Cara stood in front of her, he would not have any sense of presence. ”

“Dr. Cara wanted to rope in YC, but it was no different from daydreaming. ”

“Upon hearing this, Dr. Cara was stunned. ”

Jamila was right.

YC did not lack anything. It had both fame and fortune. It was impossible to rope in YC.

He was the one who thought this matter was too simple.

“After thinking for a while, professor Cara continued, “Then let’s start with the people around YC. What about that Cen Jiang?” ”

“”Cen Jiang?”Camilla narrowed her eyes, “Cen Jiang is the leader of the four brothers in Jianghu and Haishi. He is also one of the higher-ups of the Cen family base. If we want to rope him in, the other three will follow. “However, I think the chances of starting with this person are very low!” ”

“Why?”Dr. Cara asked.

“Gamira said, “Because Cen Jiang’s surname is Cen. Do you think he will betray Fifth Master Cen and YC?” ”

“Cen Jiang’s surname was not only Cen, but he was also very loyal. He came from the power behind Cen Shaoqing. Anyone could betray the CEN family base. ”

“Only Jianghe, Huhai and the other two would not! ”

Dr. Cara blew out a smoke ring. “Then who do you think is the most suitable?” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“”As far as I know, Feng Qi has a very good apprentice named Gu Si, who is also involved in the aircraft carrier program,”said Jamila ”
