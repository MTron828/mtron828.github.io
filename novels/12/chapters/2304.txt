Translator: 549690339

Ye Langhua pushed Old Lady Lin to the north wing room.

“It was different from the previous grand and magnificent room. Now, the north wing room was very clean. As soon as she walked in, she could smell a faint sandalwood scent. ”

Old Lady Lin was still worshipping Bodhisattva in the north wing room. What she did every day was to recite scriptures and pray for the Lin family. Next was to atone for her sins. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Ye Langhua wanted to continue pushing Old Lady Lin into the house, but was interrupted by Old Lady Lin. “Let’s do it here, Langhua. The house is too stuffy.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Langhua nodded and stopped walking. He stopped his wheelchair beside the pavilion in the small courtyard.

“The Bright Moon Hung High in the sky like a white jade plate, draping a layer of white gauze over everything in the courtyard. ”

“A cool breeze blew, and the scent of sandalwood was even stronger. There was also a faint fragrance of flowers. ”

Old Lady Lin had someone make tea and bring it over.

“The bright moon and the clear tea. The scene was indeed beautiful, but unfortunately, the timing was not right. ”

Ye Langhua knew very clearly that Old Lady Lin had not invited her over for some hot spring and white snow topic.

“Old Lady Lin personally poured a cup of tea for ye Langhua. “Langhua, drink some tea.” ”

“Ye Langhua picked up the Teacup and took a sip before turning to look at Old Lady Lin. “Elder sister, if you have anything to say, just say it.”At their age and having experienced so many things, ye Langhua felt that.., anything between them could be said without reservation. ”

“Old Lady Lin smiled and said, “Actually, it’s nothing much. I just want to have a chat with someone before I leave.” ”

“Old Lady Lin’s words were light, and ye Langhua did not seem to understand what she meant. ”

“Leave? Where are you going? Are you going on a trip?”

“”In life, the grass and the trees fall. In the end, dust returns to dust.”When it came to matters of life and death, there was not much sadness on Old Lady Lin’s face. ”

“Her life had been full of ups and downs. After experiencing so many things, she had long since become indifferent to life and death. ”

“To Old Lady Lin, death was just a matter of closing one’s eyes. There was nothing to be afraid of. ”

It was just that there were some things that she could not let go of.

“Ye Langhua also understood the meaning behind Old Lady Lin’s words. She continued, “Elder sister, your body is fine now. Don’t think too much about it.” ”

Old Lady Lin shook her head. “I know my own body very well.”

She knew that her time was almost up and she did not have much time left.

“Putting Old Lady Lin in such a state.., ye Langhua continued, “Elder sister, are you sick? ! Don’t worry. Nowadays, medicine is so advanced that even cancer can be cured, let alone other illnesses! Let’s go to the hospital! I’ll send you there right now!”If she was not sick.., old Lady Lin would definitely not say these words for no reason. ”

“”There’s no need,”Old Lady Lin said with a smile. “I’m not suffering from any serious illness. I’m just at the end of my life.” ”

“At this point, Old Lady Lin grabbed ye Langhua’s hand and gently patted it, she sighed and said, “My life has been a failure. Before I left, I didn’t even think of finding someone to talk to. Fortunately, I still have you, Langhua. Thank you for not bothering me about what happened before.” ”

“For some reason, Ye Lang Hua’s heart sank when she saw Old Lady Lin like this. For a moment, she didn’t know what to say. ”

“Old Lady Lin continued, “I’ve done too many wrong things in my life. First, I almost caused fourth brother to be destroyed by Zhao Shuning’s hands. Then, I caused Jin city and Ah Shu to be destroyed... even burning...”at the end of her sentence, old Lady Lin was already sobbing uncontrollably. Her tears were like beads that had lost their thread. ”

“It’s all in the past.”Ye Langhua handed a tissue to Old Lady Lin.

“Old Lady Lin took the tissue and wiped her tears. She then said, “Langhua, you’ve given birth to a good daughter... Thank you, thank you for giving birth to such a good daughter!” ”

“Ye Langhua was also a little sad. “Elder sister, don’t say that. Jin city is also a good child.” ”

“”The child is a good child. Unfortunately, it was delayed by a mother like me.”Old Lady Lin blamed herself. “If it weren’t for me, the family of four would have been happier.” ”

Old Lady Lin regretted it.

“Especially recently, she always dreamed of the past. In her dreams, she looked at her ugly face and wanted to tear it up immediately. ”

“”Since the matter has already passed, don’t think too much about it,”ye langhua continued, “People have to learn to move on.” ”

Old Lady Lin nodded. “You’re right. People should move on. I just want to tell you everything before I leave.”
