Translator: 549690339

Song Chenyu’s eyes lit up.

She didn’t expect such an unexpected gain from this trip to the food street.

“At this moment, Song Chenyu saw another figure.”

Who was that?

Ye Zao?

Why was ye Zao Here Too?

The light in song Chenyu’s eyes instantly disappeared.

“After a while, a smile returned to Song Chenyu’s face.”

So what if ye Zao was here?

“Even if ye Zao was here, she could still let Cen Shaoqing see her!”

“Thinking of this, song Chenyu hurriedly trotted over. “Yezi!””

Ye Zao looked back slightly.

“Song Chenyu said with a face full of surprise, “Yezi, it really is you! I thought I was mistaken!””

“Ye Zao’s tone was indifferent. “Miss Song, we don’t seem to be that close outside the show.””

The smile on song Chenyu’s face froze for a moment. She did not expect that ye Zao would not give her face.

What was there to be proud of about ye Zao?

If it was not for Cen Shaoqing and the Lin family.

Ye Zao was nothing!

“Putting aside those gorgeous identities, ye Zao was just a small Internet celebrity.”

“The smile on song Chenyu’s face did not diminish. She continued, “I’m sorry, Miss Ye. I was too rash!”As soon as she said that, song Chenyu looked as if she had just seen Cen Shaoqing. She said in surprise, “Mr. Cen is here too.””

CEN Shaoqing’s gaze directly passed song Chenyu. He held something in one hand and held ye Zao’s hand in the other. “Shall we go over there and take a look?”

“Yes.”

Cen Shaoqing was only temporarily mesmerized by ye Zao.

“As long as she persisted, Cen Shaoqing would definitely be able to see her.”

“Song Chenyu comforted himself in his heart and continued, “Miss Ye, Mr. Cen, I came alone today. It’s not easy to meet acquaintances in the east continent. Why don’t I treat you to a cup of tea?””

“Miss Song.”Cen Shaoqing looked back slightly.

“Looking at Cen Shaoqing’s profile, Song Chenyu’s heart skipped a beat.”

He called her name.

Song Chenyu was very excited.

Why did Cen Shaoqing call her?

Could it be that he took the initiative to invite her to tea?

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “I’m not Cen Yuyan. I know very well what kind of person you are. I advise you to put away those shameful thoughts. A girl must have some sense of shame.””

These words did not leave any face. They directly turned into sharp blades and slashed at song Chenyu’s face.

Song Chenyu was immediately stunned.

She did not expect Cen Shaoqing to suddenly say such words.

Cen Shaoqing clearly did not hate her this much in the past!

Why did Cen Shaoqing suddenly become like this?

Could it be because of ye Zhuo?

Yes!

It must be ye Zao!

How many bad things did ye Zao say about her in front of Cen Shaoqing?

Song Chenyu looked at Ye Zao and Cen Shaoqing’s backs as they left. She was so angry that her entire body was trembling.

Wait!

She must make ye Zao pay the price.

Song Chenyu clenched her fists.

“At ten o’clock the next morning, Cen Shaoqing and ye Zao boarded a private plane back to the capital.”

“At three o’clock in the afternoon, the plane successfully arrived at the Beijing Airport.”

Cen Shaoqing drove ye Zao to the Lin family home.

“Ye Zao had not returned for a week. Lin Jincheng, Ye Shu, and Lin Ze stood at the door waiting for her.”

“”Dad, Mom, Brother!””

“Zao Zao is back.”Ye Shu walked forward and hugged ye Zao.

“They had only been separated for a week, but ye Shu felt that it had been a few months.”

“Lin Jincheng sized up ye Zao and frowned slightly. “You seem to have lost a lot of weight! Zao Zao, what did you eat in the program team these few days?”Lin Jincheng was even considering it now, when Ye Zao was filming the second episode, should he send two chefs along.”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “How did I lose weight? Dad! You must have seen wrongly! The ingredients given by the program team are especially fresh, and the air in the mountains is also very good. I feel like I’ve gained weight these few days!””

“Lin Jincheng frowned and said, “Ingredients? Does that mean that you have to cook your own food?”” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Lin Jincheng continued, “What’s your next program shoot?””

“”In half a month.”Ye Zao continued, “What’s the matter, Dad?””

“Lin Jincheng said, “Don’t you like to eat the food cooked by chef Li and chef Wang the most? When the time comes, let them go with you!””

Lin Ze nodded. “I think dad is right!”

“After not seeing ye Zao for a week, not only did Lin ze think that ye Zao had lost weight, he even felt that ye Zao was a little malnourished.”

“Ye Zao knew that Lin Jincheng was not joking with her, “Dad, brother, what are you two talking about! I’m going to participate in the program, not to enjoy it! What does it look like to bring a chef with me? If people who don’t know see it, they’ll think that I’m acting like a big miss!””

“Lin Jincheng said, “You’re the big miss of our Lin family to begin with!””

Ye Zao:”...”

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “Alright, Alright, stop standing at the door and talking. Hurry up and go in!”After saying that, ye Shu continued, “Right, Zao Zao, Where’s Shaoqing? Didn’t he send you back? Why didn’t I See Him?””

“Ye Zao said, “He has a meeting to attend. He’s going back to the company.””

“OH.”Ye Shu nodded.

The family of four walked into the house.

“Lin Ze continued, “Zao Zao, when is your program going to be broadcast?””

“Ye Zao said, “It should be in a week. The director said that he would inform the group after confirming the time.””

“Old Lady Lin was sitting in a wheelchair, hiding behind a statue. She looked at the family of four and secretly wiped away her tears.”

“If she was a good grandmother, she could stand together with Lin Jincheng, Ye Shu, and the others to welcome ye Zhuo back today.”

Unfortunately.

She was not a good grandmother.

“These days, Old Lady Lin had been living in repentance.”

“”Old Lady, don’t cry.”Auntie Wang handed Old Lady Lin a handkerchief.”

“Old Lady Lin smiled and said, “I’m not crying, I’m not crying! Let’s go back too.””

Auntie Wang Sighed and pushed Old Mrs. Lin back.

“In order to celebrate ye Zao’s return home, Lin Jincheng personally cooked a table full of sumptuous dishes in the evening.”

“After eating, Lin Ze brought over a plate of beautiful desserts. “Zao Zao, try it and see if it tastes good.””

Ye Zao took a bite and nodded. “It’s very delicious!”

A faint smile appeared on Lin Ze’s lips.

“Ye Shu looked at Lin Ze. “Ah Ze, I saw you frequently coming and going to the dessert room a few days ago. This dessert was made by you personally, right?””

“Hearing this, Ye Zao raised his head to look at Lin Ze. “Brother, it was really made by you personally?””

Lin Ze nodded.

“Because ye Zao liked to eat desserts, Lin Ze learned a thing or two from the family’s dessert master.”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Brother, you are really amazing! Since you made it yourself, I have to taste it well.”As he said that, ye Zao took a bite and tasted it carefully.”

“”The Milky fragrance is rich. The cream in the cream still feels like it is exploding. There is also the fragrance of mint. Brother, this is the best dessert I have ever eaten!””

“”Really?”Get the praise of leaf burning, the eyes of Lin Ze all follow to light up.”

“”Of course it is true.”Ye Zhuo then said: “My Brother is the best brother in the world, make the dessert of course delicious!””

“Ye Shu looked at Lin Ze, pretended to blame: “Ah Ze, you give burning a person to do dessert? No Mother’s share? is not a bit too biased?””

Lin Ze was a little embarrassed. “I thought you didn’t like sweet food.”

“Ye Shu continued, “Who said I don’t like Sweet Food?””

“Then I’ll make it for you next time.”

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “Mom is joking with you. You just have to make it for your sister alone.””

“In the blink of an eye, it was the day of the Chinese art world’s presidential election.”

“The presidential election was a big event. After the election, there was still an art exhibition.”

Ye Zao looked at the warmth in front of him and his heart raced.

To be able to have such a warm family atmosphere was something that she did not even dare to dream about in her previous life.

“The next day, ye Zao went to school.”

“Li Yueyue had not seen ye Zao for a long time. When she saw ye Zao return, she was extremely excited. “Great Zao, you’re finally back! I’ve missed you to death!””

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “I’ve missed you too.””

“Li Yueyue continued, “How was your participation in the ‘village’program? Did you get my Idol’s autograph for me?””

“Autograph?”Ye Zao was stunned. “What autograph?”

“The smile on Li Yueyue’s face instantly disappeared. “Wei Xingzhi’s autograph! Great Zao, did you forget about this?””

“Ye Zhuo scratched his head in embarrassment. “I’m sorry, Yueyue, I really forgot...””

Li Yueyue was about to cry.

“She especially liked Wei Xingzhi. Ever since she was young, her house was filled with posters of Wei Xingzhi.”

“At this moment, Ye Zhuo took out a notebook from his bag and said with a smile, “Idiot! I lied to you just now! This is teacher Wei’s autograph. Take a look.””

“Li Yueyue took the autographed photo and instantly revived with full health. She jumped up and hugged ye zhuo, “Ah Ah Ah! Da Zhuolao, I love you so much! Da Zhuolao, you are the best da Zhuolao in the world!””
