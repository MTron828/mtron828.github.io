“When she arrived, Wang Shuya had already arrived. ”

“Goddess!”

“Shuya.”

Ye Zhuo handed two bottles to Wang Shuya. “The blue bottle is used to suppress toxins. The white bottle has a health care effect. There’s only one pill in it. Tell people to be more cautious.”

There were no problems with these two medicines.

“However, if they were taken at the same time, there would be side effects. ”

Hemiplegia.

She could only lie in bed for the rest of her life.

“”Understood.”Wang Shuya took the bottle. “Leave this to me. Goddess, you can rest assured.” ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

...

“Ever since the big fight with Lin Jincheng yesterday, the more Old Lady Lin thought about it, the more uncomfortable she felt. She was extremely angry. ”

“She wanted to drive the Lin family away from the Lin family, but Lin Jincheng refused to leave! ”

Fine!

“They won’t leave, right? ”

Then she would go and fetch Feng Xianxian back.

With her here.

Let’s see who dares to make things difficult for Feng Xianxian!

“In the future, Feng Xianxian would be her biological granddaughter. ”

Whoever made things difficult for Feng Xianxian would be making things difficult for her.

“Old Lady Lin came to Feng Xianxian’s apartment and held Feng Xianxian’s hand. “Let’s Go! Xianxian, come home with me!” ”

“Feng Xianxian asked doubtfully, “Grandma, Uncle Lin and the others agreed to let me go?” ”

“Old Mrs. Lin said angrily, “There’s no need for them to agree! I’m the one in charge of the Lin Family! Do I have to look at their faces when I bring someone home?” ”

She was the one in charge of the Lin Family!

“”That’s not good, right?”Feng Xianxian said awkwardly, “Grandma, you and uncle Lin and Auntie ye are a real family. You Don’t have to hurt your feelings for an outsider like me.” ”

“Seeing how sensible Feng Xianxian was, old Mrs. Lin was very touched. ”

“Feng Xianxian wasn’t related to her by blood, yet she could do this. ”

What about Lin Jincheng?

What about Lin Ze?

What about Ye Zhuo?

“They were her own son, grandson, and granddaughter. ”

And in the end?

They were even worse than an outsider!

Especially Lin Ze.

“Lin Ze was a dragon and a Phoenix. When he first returned to the Lin family, he weighed less than three pounds. ”

She was the one who raised him little by little.

But what about Lin Ze?

How did Lin ze repay her?

“Ever since ye Shu returned, Lin Ze had forgotten about her as his grandmother. ”

“Every time she thought of this, Old Mrs. Lin would be heartbroken. ”

She wished she could die.

“If she had known earlier that raising Lin Ze would be better than raising an outsider, she would never have raised him. ”

All of them did not put her in their eyes at all!

“The more old Mrs. Lin thought about it, the angrier she got. She grabbed Feng Xianxian’s hand tightly. “Who said you’re an outsider! From now on, you’re my biological granddaughter! In my heart, no one can compare to you!” ”

“”Grandma, thank you.”Feng Xianxian hugged old Mrs. Lin emotionally. ”

“From an angle that old Mrs. Lin could not see, a sinister light appeared in Feng Xianxian’s eyes. ”

Damn old woman.

She was really stupid!

She deserved to be deceived.

Biological granddaughter?

What right did this damn old woman have to be her biological grandmother?

“Sooner or later, she would let this damn old woman get what she deserved. ”

Feng Xianxian narrowed her eyes.

“”Good child! There’s no need to thank Grandma!”Old Lady Lin let go of Feng Xianxian and continued, “Let’s go, Xianxian, go back with Grandma.” ”

“Feng Xianxian was still a little hesitant, “Grandma, I think it’s not good. After all...” ”

“”There’s nothing bad about it! I’m the one in charge of the Lin family now!”Old Lady Lin continued, “Xianxian, don’t be afraid. As long as I’m by your side, no one will dare to bully you!” ”

“Grandma...” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Old Lady Lin frowned and said, “Why are you so afraid? They don’t put me in their eyes. Don’t tell me you don’t have a Grandma in your eyes?” ”

“Feng Xianxian quickly explained, “No! Grandmother, you’ve misunderstood! I’ve always treated you as my own grandmother! You’re the only family I have in this world!” ”

“”In that case, you can go home with grandmother!”Old Lady Lin said with a straight face, “If you don’t go home with me, it means that you don’t have a grandmother in your eyes at all!” ”

“Feng Xianxian bit her lip and continued, “Then Grandma, Please Wait for me for a while. I’ll pack my things first.” ”

“Only then was Old Lady Lin Satisfied. She smiled and said, “Sure, you can just pack a few clothes. The house doesn’t lack anything.” ”

“Okay.”

Very soon.

Feng Xianxian packed her clothes.

“The two of them walked out of the apartment and got into the car. They set off for the Lin family manor. The car was very fast, and in a short while, they arrived at the entrance of the Mian Xiu Manor. ”

“The door, which was originally wide open, was suddenly closed. ”
