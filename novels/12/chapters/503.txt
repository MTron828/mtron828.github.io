The sound of footsteps was getting closer and closer. The door was pushed open from the outside and Old Madam Lin saw a familiar figure walking in from the outside.

It was Feng Qianhua!

It was really Feng Qianhua!

Old Madam Lin was so happy that she forgot to cough. “Qianhua!”

She did not expect that Feng Qianhua would still come to visit her at this time!

Old Madam Lin was extremely grateful.

“”Auntie Lin.”Feng Qianhua jogged over. “Auntie Lin, are you alright?” ”

“Old Madam Lin’s eyes were red as she said, “You child, with such a big incident, I should be the one asking you if you’re alright. Instead, you’re asking me if I’m alright. Qianhua, don’t worry, I’ll definitely get Jin City to give you an explanation! “Regardless of whether or not the engagement party goes smoothly today, you’re the only daughter-in-law in my heart!” ”

“”I’m fine too. You Don’t have to worry.”Feng Qianhua unscrewed the lid of the Thermos and served Old Lady Lin Soup, she said, “Aunt Lin, there are some things that can’t be forced. I know that brother Jin city has always had sister ye Shu in his heart.” ”

“Saying this, Feng Qianhua handed the soup to Old Lady Lin. ”

Old Lady Lin took the soup and impatiently drank it. The familiar taste entered her throat and the discomfort from her lungs immediately disappeared.

Feng Qianhua looked at Old Lady Lin and narrowed her eyes. A glimmer flashed through her eyes.

It was fleeting.

“Feng Qianhua continued, “Aunt Lin, I’m willing to help Jin Cheng and sister Ye Shu. I hope that you can put aside your prejudice against sister ye Shu and help them.” ”

“Upon hearing this, Old Madam Lin was displeased. She knocked the bowl on the bedside table, “Qianhua, what nonsense are you talking about? Don’t worry. As long as I’m around, those fickle women outside won’t dare to ride on your head and do whatever they want!” ”

“A bitter smile appeared on the corner of Feng Qianhua’s mouth. “Aunt Lin, I know that you feel sorry for me and can’t bear to see me suffer. Actually, as long as I can see brother Jin Cheng Happy, it’s fine. This kind of grievance is nothing.” ”

“Hearing this, Old Madam Lin Sighed. “You Child, everything is good, but your heart is too soft. When you encounter things, you never think of yourself. The first thing you think of is always others.” ”

“If Feng Qianhua could be a little selfish, she wouldn’t have become like this. ”

“”Old Madam, Old Madam Cen is here,”the butler came in to report. ”

“Hearing this, Feng Qianhua narrowed her eyes. Old Madam Lin hurriedly sat up. “Please come in!” ”

“Okay.”

“Although the Lin and CEN families were on good terms, this was the first time Feng Qianhua had seen old Mrs. Cen. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen was leaning on a walking stick with a dragon head. Although her hair had turned white, she was still full of energy and her face was red. Old Mrs. Lin was obviously two or three years younger than old Mrs. Cen, but she looked younger. ”

“Moreover, old Mrs. Cen had an aura hidden on her. She looked a little dignified, making people not dare to look into her eyes. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen walked straight to the bed and asked with concern, “Fangyue, are you alright?” ”

“Old Mrs. Lin’s surname was Zhao, and her maiden name was Zhao fangyue. ”

The Zhao family’s ancestors were from a scholarly family in Liu City. She had met old Mrs. Cen when they were in university.

“Old Mrs. Lin shook her head and introduced her to old Mrs. Cen. “This is Jin city’s fiancée, Feng Qianhua. Qianhua, this is old Mrs. Cen.” ”

“Feng Qianhua immediately stood up. “Nice to meet you, Old Lady.” ”

“Okay.”Old Lady Cen Glanced at Feng Qianhua.

Feng Qianhua regretted not bringing Feng Xianxian along earlier.

“Feng Xianxian was especially popular with the elderly. If Feng Xianxian was here, she would definitely be able to please Old Lady Cen. ”

“”Aunt Lin, you can chat with Old Lady Cen First. I’ll go to the kitchen and make some tonic for you to drink tonight.”After saying that, Feng Qianhua looked at Old Lady Cen, then she said, “Old Madam, Aunt Lin is in a bad mood. Please help me enlighten her.” ”

Old Mrs. Cen nodded.

Feng Qianhua turned and left.

“After Feng Qianhua left, Old Mrs. Cen sat down by the bed. “Fangyue, was that the wife you found for Jin City just now?” ”

“Old Mrs. Lin nodded. “You think it’s not bad too, right?” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen shook her head. “To be honest, it’s really not that good! It’s not that I want to say this, but when you were studying, your taste was not as good as mine. I didn’t expect that as you get older, your taste is still not as good as mine!” ”

These words were a little piercing.

“In Old Mrs. Lin’s heart, Feng Qianhua was 10,000 times better. She did not expect Old Mrs. Cen to belittle her. ”

“Old Mrs. Lin said, “How is Qianhua not good? She has to have good looks, a good figure, and a good heart! Jin city has already treated her like this, but she is still defending Jin city and saying that it’s not Jin city’s fault! And she even came to give me health-preserving soup! Where can I find a second such a good woman?” ” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎
