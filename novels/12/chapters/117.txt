Chapter 118: 078: an unknown past! Brother Ze, your birth mother might be in Yun Jing! 4

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Mr. Song, you know ZY as well?”

“I’ve heard of it a little.”

ZY technology company was a newly emerging industry. Although it had only recently developed, it was extremely powerful.

First, it applied for the world’s first patent for temperature-adjustable clothing, and then it forcefully pushed it into the market.

Recently, ZY’s CEO had extended an olive branch to him and proposed a collaboration. Previously, Song Shiyu did not take it to heart, but now it seemed that the collaboration could not be delayed.

The two of them each had their own thoughts as they stepped into the open-air path together.

Camellias were planted in the garden, and the fiery red camellias almost covered the entire path. The color of ye Zao’s gown just happened to echo with these camellias. Under the cover of the night, her face was hidden and faintly discernible.

One could not help but wonder if she was not an illusion of these camellias.

The cold wind blew gently, bringing with it the fragrance of Camellias. There was also a hint of refreshing fragrance that lingered at the tip of the nose. It was especially pleasant to smell.

This fragrance did not belong to the camellias.

Song Shiyu was extremely sensitive to the smell. He glanced sideways at ye Zao.

She looked ahead and focused on the road.

Song Shiyu had only met two types of women in his life.

The first type was those who fell in love with him at first sight.

The second type was those who feared him like Mu Yourong.

This was the first time he had met someone like ye Zao.

Song Shiyu was very curious. was she born like this, or was her method brilliant.

Right at this moment, ye Zao suddenly felt a burning gaze sizing her up.

Ye Zao slightly raised his eyes.

He saw Mu Yourong standing not far away.

That gaze, he wanted nothing more than to directly swallow her alive.

Little Slut!

Mu Yourong never would have thought that the little divine doctor ye that Old Master Yang spoke of was actually ye Zao.

It was ye Zao again.

When she was young, ye Zao Dove occupied the magpie’s nest and stole her position.

When the truth finally came out with great difficulty, she once again became the eldest daughter of the Mu family. First, Ye Zao snatched away the glory that belonged to her in the chess world, forcing her to demote her system!

Now, he had snatched away the favor that originally belonged to her for saving her life!

She should not have looked down on ye Zao from the start, and she should not have let ye Zao go.

She should have been the same as in her previous life.

She had trapped ye Zao in the Mu family and tortured her mercilessly. Finally, she had made her marry song Shiyu, torturing her to death!

Mu Yourong regretted it.

She really regretted it.

But fortunately, she had already succeeded in letting ye Zao see Song Shiyu.

With song Shiyu, this demon of the human world, around.

Ye Zao would die a very miserable death!

The corners of Ye Zao’s mouth curled up slightly, and just like that, he met Mu Yourong’s gaze. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Mu Yourong did not expect ye Zao to suddenly look at her. She hurriedly withdrew her gaze, lowered her head, and walked towards another exit.

In a short while, she arrived at the back hall.

Compared to the brightly lit front hall, the back hall was much more deserted.

Two old men, one tall and one short, stood outside the door.

“It’s Little Miracle Doctor Ye!”

When grandfather Yang saw ye Zao, he excitedly went up to greet him. “Little Miracle Doctor Ye!”

“Grandfather Yang.”

“Little Miracle Doctor Ye is really you!”Grandfather Yang continued, “I’ve already been looking for you for three days!”

Song Shiyu reminded, “Old Master Yang, it’s getting late. Why Don’t you invite Miss Ye in to talk?”

“Yes, yes, yes!”Old Master Yang invited ye Zao in.

When they were outside, Old Madam song did not see ye Zao’s appearance clearly.

When she looked at him.

The old man was immediately stunned.

This little girl was too beautiful!

Her medical skills were good.

She was beautiful.

The old man looked at song Shiyu who was standing at the side, then at ye Zao.

Her eyes were filled with satisfaction.

A match!

They were a perfect match!

She had never seen two people who were so compatible.

Song Shiyu was 28, and Ye Zao was 18.

Although there was a difference of ten years between the two, girls nowadays liked to find someone older than them.

Being older gave them a sense of security.

Old Madam song immediately pulled ye Zao’s hand. “Little Miracle Doctor, I’m Song Shiyu’s grandmother. I’m an old friend of your grandfather Yang. If you don’t mind, you can call me Grandma Song.”

“Grandma Song.”

“Ai!”Old Madam song replied with a smile.

The song family had only three generations

Her greatest regret in her life was that she did not have a granddaughter.

Ye Zhuo very well satisfied her fantasy of a granddaughter.

Old Madam Song hurriedly asked the maid to bring the best tea and some snacks that little girls liked to eat. She was even more enthusiastic than grandfather Yang.

Of course, the future granddaughter-in-law had to curry favor with her.

Old Mrs. Song’s health had been getting worse and worse recently.

She was really afraid that after she left, song Shiyu would be left alone.

This child had already suffered too much. For the rest of his life, Old Mrs. Song wanted him to lead a sweeter life.
