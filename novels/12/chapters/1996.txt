“Leader.”Cen Shaoqing suddenly turned to look at Ye Zhuo.

“”Go Ahead,”ye Zhuo said calmly. ”

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Can you give me a copy of the information on the General Alliance of the S Galaxy?” ”

“Knowing Yourself and your enemy, you will win every battle. ”

He had to figure out this General Alliance system.

“Sure.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “I’ll sort out a copy for you tonight.”

“Okay.”

“At around eight o’clock in the evening, ye Zao sorted out the general information of the Allied countries and sent it to Cen Shaoqing’s email. ”

“After receiving the document, Cen Shaoqing immediately opened it and studied it. ”

Cen Shaoqing didn’t sleep until the next morning.

“Ye Zao went to the restaurant in the morning and didn’t see Cen Shaoqing, which was especially strange, so he knocked on his door. ”

“Come in.”Cen Shaoqing’s voice came from inside.

Ye Zao pushed the door open and entered. He saw Cen Shaoqing sitting in front of the computer with a slightly cold expression.

“You didn’t Sleep Last Night?”Ye Zao asked in surprise.

“I’m fine.”Cen Shaoqing held the Buddha beads in one hand and the mouse in the other. “I can sleep on the plane later.”

“That’s fine too. Let’s go eat something first. We’ll be leaving soon.”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and stood up to follow ye Zhuo’s footsteps.

“When they arrived at the restaurant, the two of them ate. ” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“At 9:30 am, they boarded the plane on time. ”

“After boarding the plane, Cen Shaoqing lay down on the chair to rest. ”

“At 2:30 pm, the plane arrived at the capital airport on time. ”

...

On the other side.

S galaxy.

Duanmu family.

Duanmu Feng and her daughter were sitting on the sofa. “What exactly is the grand tutor going to do to bring young master back?”

“”Don’t worry, you can’t be impatient.”Mrs. Duanmu, who was dressed in luxurious clothes, patted her daughter’s hand. ”

“Duanmu fengyu frowned and said, “What kind of stupid rule is this! They have to get married and have children on Earth in order to bring him back! What’s so good about the bloodline of a low-level earthling?” ”

“Upon hearing this, Mrs. Duanmu’s face turned pale and she immediately reached out to cover Duanmu Fengyu’s mouth. “My little ancestor, you can’t say these words carelessly.” ”

It was true that Earthlings were inferior.

But how could these words be said carelessly?

“If people heard this, they might make a scene about the DUANMU family. ”

It was extremely cold at the top!

“Duanmu fengyu said somewhat speechlessly, “I told you so! Let’s see who dares to find trouble with me!” ”

“”Five thousand years ago, the first batch of humans that appeared in our S galaxy were Earthlings,”Mrs. Duanmu continued, “To a certain extent, we are all Earthlings.” ”

Duanmu Fengyu did not speak.

“”How long ago was that? As long as I’m not an Earthling Now!”Duanmu Fengyu’s eyes flashed with ridicule, “5,000 years ago, our ancestors were able to cross millions of light years to arrive in the s galaxy. However, those low-level earthlings were unable to do so. This is enough to prove that their earthlings have nothing to do with us!” ”

Duanmu Feng went to Earth once when she was very young.

“At that time, the humans on earth still had pigtails that wrapped around their feet. They also had a serious preference for boys over girls. Therefore, she didn’t have a good impression of earth. ”

Little did she know.

“After so many years, earth was no longer that Earth. ”

“Mrs. Duanmu was too lazy to argue with her daughter. She continued, “It’s fine if you tell me this at home, but you can’t tell me this outside.” ”

“Duanmu Fengyu didn’t say anything. She lowered her head and looked at Mrs. Duanmu. “Mom, I want to go to Earth to take a look recently.” ”

“You’re Crazy!”Mrs. Duanmu’s face turned pale.

“Earth wasn’t a place that could be visited casually. “If you disrupt the normal lives of people on Earth, not only you, but the entire Duanmu family will be implicated!” ”

Who Was Earth’s backer?

“Of course, it was the main alliance. ”

“Don’t you still have my aunt?”Duanmu Feng asked.

“Have you forgotten your aunt’s surname?”Mrs. Duanmu asked.

The entire duanmu family would be implicated. Would Duanmu Fenfei be spared?

“Duanmu Feng hugged Mrs. Duanmu’s arm and said, “Mom, I promise you that I will not cause any trouble. I just want to take a look at young master from afar.” ”

“No.”Mrs. Duanmu directly denied it.

“Mom!”Duanmu Feng and Mrs. Duanmu hugged her arm and began to act coquettishly.

“”Feng and, I can promise you anything else, but this matter is out of the question!”Mrs. Duanmu continued, “Don’t think that I don’t know what you are thinking! Suppress your little thoughts and don’t think about what you shouldn’t think!” ”

Duanmu Fengyou bit her lip unwillingly.

She was truly unresigned.

She was unresigned that every general alliance had the bloodline of Earthlings.
