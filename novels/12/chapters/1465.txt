Translator: 549690339

Adar was the manager of Selead’s headquarters.

He was also a citizen of Country F who had noble blood.

Country F was different from other countries.

Country F was divided into four classes.

“High-class people, middle-class people, ordinary people, and low-class people.”

“Adar not only had noble blood, but was also a high-class person. He also had a high-class surname.”

“In his subconscious mind, China had always been a very backward country.”

“After all, country F had already taken the subway, and the Chinese were still in the Qing dynasty, with pigtails.”

“Although they had experienced changes later, the roots of China were there!”

How good could it be?

“In addition, Adar was born noble, so he looked down on the Chinese from the bottom of his heart.”

“Especially a young girl like ye Zao, who looked like she was not an adult yet.”

“She had to have experience, experience, and knowledge.”

“If it was not because of her connections, could she have come here?”

“After all, the Chinese people were best at using the back door.”

“They could not even understand the F language, yet they still wanted to restore the surveillance.”

Did she think she was dreaming?

Yardar’s eyes were filled with disdain.

“”SELEAD headquarters’Selection Commissioner’s Vision has also opened my eyes.”Ye Zao looked at Yardar and slightly raised his chin. His eyes were filled with radiance, “Since country F is so powerful, why can’t the two computer experts that the commissioner brought recover even a small surveillance camera?””

“She was standing in front of Yardar. She was clearly a young girl in her teens, but she gave off a strong sense of oppression.”

This kind of queen-like aura was born in her.

“If others tried to forcefully imitate her, it would only give people a sense of humor.”

Adar was stunned.

“He did not expect ye Zao to know F language. His face alternated between green and white, looking extremely ugly.”

“This low-level Chinese, did she know what she was talking about?”

Did she know who hacked the surveillance footage!

L!

L was the best hacker in the world!

The two computer experts adar brought with him were the top experts of Selead.

“Even they didn’t have any leads, let alone a Chinese!”

“If you haven’t seen the world, then you haven’t seen the world.”

“Adar was so angry that he laughed. It was a sarcastic laugh. “ABA’s Executive Ye, right? Since executive ye is so powerful, let’s invite executive ye to give it a try! Let’s open our eyes!””

“After saying that, Yardar looked at the programmer who was trying to restore the surveillance. “Polly, let Miss Ye do it!””

“Polly stood up, glanced at ye Zao, and walked behind Yardar.”

“Like Yardar, Polly looked at ye Zao with a mocking expression.”

She was too young.

“When he was playing with the computer, Ye Zao was probably still playing with the mud!”

Saying that such a little girl knew how to use a computer?

Or was she some kind of expert.

Who would believe it?

“Ye Zao leaned over and sat down. He pressed a few buttons, and the computer screen quickly switched to another page.”

“Looking at Ye Zao’s operation, Polly frowned slightly. “What is she doing? She will destroy the entire system! Does she even know how to use a computer? I think she doesn’t even know where to turn off her computer!””

“The Selead branch used the world’s most advanced and advanced system, and it had not been popularized into daily life yet.”

“Looking at ye Zao’s appearance, it was clear that she did not know anything about computers.”

“It was fine if she did not know, but she had to pretend to know!”

She was really full of ugliness!

No wonder China was still so backward until now.

“It was fine if she was embarrassed in her own country, but she had to come abroad to embarrass herself.”

“Adar patted Polly’s hand and said in a low voice, “Let her do it! I must teach this Chinese a lesson today! At that time, no matter who comes to plead for her, I will not give her face!””

“Once ye Zao’s operation caused the entire Selead branch’s system to be paralyzed, then ye Zao would be in Big Trouble!”

Polly saw Yadar’s intention and suppressed the dissatisfaction in his eyes. He didn’t say anything else.

“Just as the two of them were waiting for ye Zao to make a mistake, Bai Xiaosu, who was beside them, said in surprise, “Ah! It’s Out!”” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

What’s Out?

Yadar and Polly’s eyes revealed a satisfied light.

There must be a mistake!

“The next second, Bai Xiaosu cheered, “Deputy Executive Officer, Miss Ye has successfully restored the surveillance camera!””

“The deputy executive officer’s eyes lit up, and he quickly walked behind ye Zao.”

The screen showed that the monitor had indeed been successfully restored.

The progress bar was 100% !

“”Miss Ye, you’re really amazing!”The deputy executive officer was so excited that he could not control his volume.”
