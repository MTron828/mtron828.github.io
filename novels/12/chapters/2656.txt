Translator: 549690339

“What about sister-in-law? What’s her attitude?”Ye searing asked.

“Ye Shu said, “Your sister-in-law doesn’t care at all. Instead, she’s speaking up for your brother.” ”

“Ye searing smiled and said, “That means sister-in-law is a good person.”Bai Jingshu was a typical person who was not influenced by her original family. Back then, everyone in the Bai family, except for elder Bai, was against her marrying Lin Ze, because of this, Bai Jingshu even became the laughingstock of the entire galaxy. ”

It was because Bai Jingshu insisted on her own choice that led to today.

Ye Shu nodded. “Your sister-in-law is a rare and good daughter-in-law.”

“Cen Shaoqing silently followed behind, silently remembering the conversation between the mother and daughter. After he married ye Zao in the future, he could not make the same mistake. ”

“Not long after, the three of them walked into the house. ”

Bai Jingshu came down from upstairs. “Zao Zao.”

“Sister-in-law.”

“Cen Shaoqing also followed behind and called out, “Sister-in-law.” ”

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “You haven’t eaten yet, right?” ”

“Ye Zao said, “We’ve already eaten.” ”

“Bai Jingshu puffed out her big belly, and her limbs and face were much rounder than before. She looked like she had never felt this kind of love before. ”

“”By the way, I noticed that there are a lot of things growing on my face recently. Do you think it can be removed in the future?”Bai Jingshu continued. ”

“What Things?”Ye Zao asked.

“Bai Jingshu walked to ye Zao’s side and pointed at the spots on her face. “Look, this is it.” ”

“The spots on Bai Jingshu’s face couldn’t be seen clearly from afar. When she looked closer, they were quite obvious. ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Sister-in-law, your condition is caused by the increase in melanocyte-stimulating hormone secreted by the pituitary gland during pregnancy. Yes, after you give birth to the baby, this condition will gradually decrease. You Don’t have to worry. When the time comes, I’ll mix some medicine for you and apply it on your face.” ”

“”Will it really decrease?”Bai Jingshu was very worried about her daughter, she continued, “I saw that a few of my author friends said that freckles like these are very hard to get rid of. Their children are already several years old, and they still have these spots on their faces.” ”

“Bai Jingshu’s skin was fair, and the spots on her face were very obvious when she was not wearing any makeup. ”

“”It’s really nothing. With a powerful sister-in-law like me around, what are you worried about!”Ye Zao said. ”

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “Yes, yes, yes. After all, they don’t have a powerful sister-in-law.” ”

“The sister-in-law and sister-in-law chatted and laughed, and the atmosphere was especially harmonious. ”

“At this moment, ye Shu asked, “Jingshu, did ah ze tell you when he will be back?” ”

“He didn’t tell you the exact time. It should be in the next few days.”

“Lin Ze was very busy, very busy. The two of them would say goodnight to each other every day when it was time. She rarely asked when he would be back. ”

“Ye Shu said, “This child should be back by now.” ”

“”Mom, he’s busy outside. Don’t worry.”The husband and wife had to give each other enough space ”

There was enough space.

“Ye Shu said, “This child of yours is so heartless.” ”

“For both husband and wife, during the first ten months of pregnancy, it was the easiest time for a man to have an affair. It wasn’t that her mother didn’t trust Lin Ze, but she just felt that Bai Jingshu was too heartless. There were exceptions to everything, lin Ze had been lied to before. Ye Shu was worried that Lin Ze would be tricked by someone with ulterior motives. ”

“In today’s society, some people would do anything to achieve their goals. ”

“Bai Jingshu smiled. She trusted Lin ze very much. Sometimes, couples needed to communicate, but there were some things that didn’t need to be communicated at all. Just by looking at each other, one could know what the other was thinking. ”

“”Mom, there’s no need to be so calculative in a marriage.” ”

“Ye Shu also smiled and continued, “What do you guys want to eat tonight? I’ll go to the kitchen and make some arrangements.” ”

“Bai Jingshu said, “I just want to eat green bean sprouts with vinegar.” ”

“Just one?”Ye Shu asked.

“Yes.”Bai Jingshu nodded.

Ye Shu looked at ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing. “What about the two of you?”

“”I want to eat boiled fish.”Ye Zao continued, “And some dessert after dinner.” ”

“What about Shaoqing?”Ye Shu asked.

“CEN Shaoqing said, “Auntie, I like everything that Zao likes to eat.” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Mom, don’t you know him? He’s like a lamb. Just ask the kitchen to prepare more grass.” ”

“”How can you say that?”Ye Shu said, “How can Shaoqing Be a Lamb? Besides, if Shaoqing is a lamb, then what are you?” ” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly. “You’re really my biological mother.”

Ye Shu smiled and poked ye Zhuo’s head.

“That night, just as they were about to eat, Lin Ze came back. ”

“He walked to the dining room, looking travel-worn. “Dad, Mom, I’m back.” ”

“”Ah Ze is back!”Lin Jincheng said, “Why didn’t you call ahead to inform us?” ”

“I wanted to give you a surprise.”Especially Bai Jingshu.

“”A surprise? !”Ye Shu said, “No one’s going out when their wife is about to give birth.” ”

“Lin Ze continued, “That’s why I ended my work there as soon as possible.” ”

“”Sit down and eat,”ye Shu said. ”

Lin Ze walked over to Bai Jingshu and sat down.

...

“At 11:30 pm, Bai Jingshu was awakened by waves of pain. It was an unfamiliar pain. Bai Jingshu turned on the lamp. ”

Lin Ze also woke up immediately. “What’s wrong with Jingshu? Does she have a stomachache?”

“Yes.”Bai Jingshu nodded. “It seems like she’s going into labor.”

“Lin Ze immediately said, “I’ll go get mom and dad right away. Wait a moment.” ”

“Soon, the Lin family’s house was brightly lit. ”

“Ye Shu had already prepared everything. “Ah Ze, quickly carry Jingshu to the car. I’ll Go Get Zhuozhuo.” ”

“Okay.”

Ye Zhuozao was still awake when he heard the commotion. He immediately changed out of his pajamas and went downstairs. “Is sister-in-law going into labor?”

“Ye Shu nodded repeatedly. “Zhuozao, let’s hurry to the hospital.” ”
