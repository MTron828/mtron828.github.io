“Although Lin Qingxuan did not usually say much, Lin Jincheng could tell that he really wanted a child that belonged to him. ”

Ye Zhuo shook his head. “She has already missed the best period of treatment. She may never have a child of her own in this lifetime.”

“Traditional Chinese medicine emphasized looking, hearing, and asking questions. From Zhao Shuning’s face, it could be seen that her cold illness had already taken root and sprouted in her body. There was basically no hope of recovery. ”

It seemed that this Zhao shuning was not a simple person.

She did not have a child.

Her morals were not upright and her conduct was not good.

Such a person was actually able to subdue Lin Qingxuan. Zhao shuning coughed lightly and scared Lin Qingxuan out of her wits.

Did she have something on Lin Qingxuan?

Or... was it because of love?

But love should be based on one’s values and character.

Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly.

“After breakfast, ye Zao specially packed a bottle of ointment to reduce swelling and bruise in his pocket. ”

“As expected, he met Lin Qingxuan who was trimming the plants with the gardeners as soon as he left. ”

“Lin Qingxuan liked flowers and plants very much. When she saw the gardeners trimming the plants, she couldn’t help but want to do it together. ”

However.

“In psychology, trimming the plants was also a way to vent. ”

People could get a sense of pleasure by trimming the growing plants.

“Ye Zao looked at Lin Qingxuan, who was trimming the branches, and a faint light flashed in her eyes. It seemed that this fourth uncle of hers was also under a lot of psychological pressure. ”

“Fourth uncle.”Ye Zao walked over.

“Zao Zao.”Lin Qingxuan raised her head to look at Ye Zao.

“Ye Zao handed the ointment to Lin Qingxuan. “Fourth uncle, this is a ointment that can reduce swelling.” ”

“Lin Qingxuan was stunned at first, then she took the ointment with both hands. “Thank you, Zao Zao.” ”

“”You’re welcome.”Ye Zao smiled slightly. “Then fourth uncle, I’ll be leaving first.” ”

“Okay.”Lin Qingxuan nodded.

“Looking at Ye Zhuo’s departing back, Lin Qingxuan’s eyes were filled with envy. ”

“In his opinion, Lin Jincheng, who had a son and daughter, was simply a winner in life. ”

It was a pity.

He would never have a child in this lifetime.

“Today, Ye Zhuo made an Lizi and Zhao Pingting meet. ”

“Ever since the military training, this was the first time the three of them had made an appointment. ”

“When Ye Zhuo arrived at the meeting place, he found out that an Lizi and Zhao pingting were not the only ones present. Xia Xiaoman had also come. ”

“Auntie?”

“After not seeing her for half a year, Xia Xiaoman seemed to have been reborn. ”

Her clothes and attire were completely different from before. She had become younger and prettier.

“If she had not been standing with an Lizi, even ye Zhuo would not have dared to acknowledge her. ”

“Xia Xiaoman stood up with a smile and hugged ye Zao. “Zao, long time no see.” ”

“Long time no see.”

“A moment later, Xia Xiaoman released ye Zao, then she said, “I haven’t seen the three of you for a long time. I wanted to take a look at you. I left that card at the bar counter. Lizi, remember to bring Zao and Pingting to eat more delicious food! Don’t think about saving money for Mom!” ”

“An Lizi nodded. “Got it, Mom.” ”

“After Xia Xiaoman left, Zhao pingting exclaimed, “Lizi, Auntie has really changed a lot!” ”

“She’s become prettier?”An Lizi raised her eyebrows.

“”Yes, yes.”Zhao pingting nodded and continued, “By the way, has Auntie Fallen in love?” ”

“An Lizi shook her head. “Someone introduced her to my mom before, but my mom didn’t agree to it. I feel that my mom doesn’t believe in love anymore.” ”

“”Ah, no way?”Zhao Pingting felt that it was a pity. It wasn’t worth it to give up on love because of a jerk. ”

“An lizi continued, “Let’s not talk about this anymore. Oh right, Pingting, Zhonghua, what do you guys want to eat?” ”

“Ye Zhonghua said, “I want to order all the desserts in the shop!”Because he loved desserts so much, ye Zhonghua had to taste the desserts every time he went to a new shop. ”

“Zhao pingting cupped her chin and said, “I want to eat this scallion grilled chicken.” ”

...

“At around 11 o’clock in the afternoon, Feng Qianhua came to deliver soup to Old Lady Lin on time. ”

“After delivering the soup, Old Lady Lin said that she was going to the Public Security Bureau to Change Ye Zao’s name. “Qianhua, why don’t you come with us?” ” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Feng Qianhua said with some hesitation, “You didn’t ask Sister Ye Shu’s permission to change your name. Isn’t that a little bad?” ”

Old Madam Lin’s expression changed instantly. “That’s my granddaughter! Why did you have to get that Slut’s permission? Let’s see who dares to stop me today!”

She was ye Zao’s grandmother!

“If ye Zao could have that slut ye Shu’s surname, why couldn’t he have her biological grandmother’s surname? ”
