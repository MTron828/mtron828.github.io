“Chapter 1667: 349: you, Miss Ye, or you, Miss Ye! 4”

Translator: 549690339

“The corners of Dean Ma’s mouth curled up into a smile. “Think about it carefully. If Miss Ye is no longer here, won’t there be no one who can stop us from landing on Europa?” ”

“Then.., dean ma continued, “Although Miss ye is quite young and very talented, this is her fate. So what if we’re sad? The dead are dead! Even if we cry to death, we can’t bring her back from the dead!” ”

Professor Feng fell silent.

“Director ma glanced at Professor Feng, then, he said, “Actually, this is also a karmic cycle. If Miss Ye could listen to us and give up Mars to land on Europa, she wouldn’t have lost her life on Mars. “In the end, Miss Ye was too conceited. She thought that if she could create a lightspeed aircraft carrier, she would definitely be able to conquer Mars. In fact, she doesn’t understand Mars at all. How could Mars be as easy to conquer as she thought?” ”

“In director Ma’s opinion, Ye Zao had brought this upon himself. ”

“After all, he had once persuaded ye Zao not to carry out the Mars plan. ”

“If Mars was suitable for human habitation, it would not have been abandoned by the aborigines. ”

What use could an abandoned planet have for humans?

“Although director Ma felt that it was a pity that ye Zao died young despite being full of talent, he did not sympathize with her at all. ”

There was nothing to sympathize with people who asked for trouble.

“Moreover, ye Zao’s accident did not do him any harm. ”

“Professor Feng narrowed his eyes. “Although that’s what you said, Miss Ye is still too young. She’s only in her twenties!” ”

“Most importantly, Ye Zao was full of talent. ”

“Since ye Zao could create an aircraft carrier that surpassed the speed of light, then she could bring mankind a second miracle and a third miracle. But now, everything came to an abrupt end. It was really a pity! ” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Director ma sighed and said, “This is her life. What can we do? If she had listened to our words, she wouldn’t have ended up like this!” ”

“After saying that, director ma continued, “Professor Feng, now is not the time to talk about this. The most important thing now is to set a route to Europa!” ”

Director ma wished that he could immediately land in Europa!

“Professor Feng continued, “Director Ma, although going to Europa is very important, saving miss ye is more important. We should immediately report this matter to master five! Let master five think of a way to save Miss Ye!” ”

“No!”Director ma directly denied it.

“Why?”Professor Feng asked.

“Director ma continued, “Fangfei has repeatedly warned me not to tell this news to others. If you tell master five now, isn’t that slapping my face? What do you want Fangfei to think of me?”Actually, director Ma was more afraid of Cen Shaoqing coming forward, what if he saved ye Zao? ”

“Once ye Zao returned, they would never be able to go to Europe! ”

“Therefore, before this matter was exposed, CEN Shaoqing must not know about it. ”

“Upon hearing this, professor Feng Sighed. “Then, then what should we do now?” ”

“”Do our best and leave it to Fate!”Director ma continued, “Leave everything to Cen Jiang and the others. If Miss Ye is not destined to have this calamity, then she will definitely be fine! “If Miss Ye is destined to have this calamity, then no matter how much we do, it will all be in vain!” ”

“Alright!”Professor Feng said.

“She had said what she had to say and done what she had to do. It was director Ma who did not agree, so even if something really happened to ye Zhuo, it could not be blamed on her! ”

She had done her best!

“Director ma continued, “When do you think it is appropriate for us to set off for Europe?” ”

“What do you think?”Professor Yue turned to look at director Ma.

“Director ma continued, “This matter should not be delayed. It is best to proceed in the next few days!”Cen Shaoqing liked ye Zhuo so much. If something happened to Ye Zhuo, he would definitely be unable to recover, people who were unable to recover would naturally be unable to manage the base. ”

“By the time Cen Shaoqing reacted, they had already returned from Europa! ”

“Professor Feng also thought of this and nodded. “Alright, I’ll listen to you.” ”

“Director ma turned on the computer that he carried with him, then, he said, “Professor Feng, look, I plan to log in from here! I’ve done some research. The western hemisphere of Europa is covered with many rainforests. It’s almost the most likely place to give birth to life.” ”

Professor Feng looked at the computer screen and frowned slightly. “Isn’t this place too dangerous?”

“”When did you become like Miss Ye?”Director ma continued, “We’ve done so many years of research. Do you see any danger from the surface of Europa?” ”
