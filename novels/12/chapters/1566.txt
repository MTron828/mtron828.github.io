“Father Zhang scratched his head, not saying a word. ”

“Zhang Qingqing placed her phone on the table. “Dad, there’s no use in being impatient. Just wait, the Lin family will send someone over sooner or later. Just remember what I said! The ones who should be anxious now aren’t us, but the Lin Family!” ”

“Just then, a phone rang in the air. ”

Zhang Qingqing picked up her phone and took a look.

So it was an Lizi calling. She had thought that the Lin family had a strong personality... ... So it was just like that.

Why did an Lizi call at this time? She was definitely here to plead for mercy!

But what was an Lizi!

Could an lizi be considered a member of the Lin Family?

She had to make the Lin family come over personally! Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Zhang Qingqing immediately cut off an Lizi’s call.

“An Lizi was extremely anxious when Zhang Qingqing did not pick up the call. This was all her fault. If it were not for her, Lin Ze and ye Zao would not have been scolded by so many people! ”

An Lizi asked the driver to go to the Lin family manor overnight.

“Unlike what she had imagined, the Lin family manor was peaceful and peaceful. There was not the slightest bit of tension in the atmosphere. Could it be that the Lin family still did not know about the news on the internet? ”

“The Butler came out from inside and asked in surprise, “Miss, why are you here at this time?” ”

“An Lizi could not explain much. “Grandpa Butler, is burning at home?” ”

“Yes.”The butler nodded. “Please come in quickly!”

An Lizi jogged in.

Xiao Bai was mopping the floor in the living room when he saw an Lizi come in. “Old an! Old An! Why are you running so fast!”

An Lizi did not have time to talk to Whitey and rushed all the way to the elevator.

“Looking at an Lizi’s back, Whitey scratched its head and asked curiously, “What’s wrong with old an! Don’t you like me calling her old an?” ”

Ye Zao’s room door was left unattended. An Lizi did not even have time to knock on the door and rushed straight in. “Zao Zao! Zao Zao!”

“Ye Zao was sitting in front of the computer desk. When he saw an Lizi come in, he smiled and looked back. “What’s wrong with you? Why are you in such a hurry?” ”

“”Zao Zao, something bad has happened! Have You Seen Weibo? Zhang Qingqing, Zhang Qingqing, she...” ”

Ye Zao nodded slightly. “I know everything.”

“”You’re still so calm even though you know?”An lizi continued, “Zao Zao, I’m really sorry. This is all my fault! If it weren’t for me, things wouldn’t have turned out like this!” ”

“Ye Zao looked at an Lizi. “It’s not all your fault, but Lizi, you really have to be careful in the future! Not every friend can be trusted.” ”

“”Mm.”An lizi nodded and continued, “Zhuo Zhuo, what about the news online? I see that the number of views has already exceeded 50 million!” ”

“Wait a little longer.”Ye Zhuo’s tone was indifferent.

“Wait for what?”An Lizi was very anxious.

Ye Zhuo stood up and gave an Lizi a cup of beauty tea. “Don’t be anxious. Drink a cup of tea to moisten your intestines.”

“At this time, an Lizi was not in the mood to drink tea. “Zao Zao, what do you have in mind?” ”

“At this moment, ye Zao’s computer rang. Ye Zao opened the pop-up window and a faint smile appeared on his face. ”

An Lizi was anxious!

“However, there was nothing she could do even if she was anxious now. She could only patiently wait. ”

...

On the other side.

At the hotel.

“”Qingqing! Qingqing!”Mother Zhang ran in from outside and said anxiously, “Not good! Not Good!” ”

“Pregnant women were all lethargic. It was already two in the morning and Zhang Qingqing had been asleep for a while. When she suddenly heard mother Zhang’s voice, Zhang Qingqing shuddered and hurriedly opened her eyes, “What’s wrong, Mom! Did the Lin family send someone over?” ”

“Mother Zhang continued, “Your phone! Quick, look at your phone!” ”

“Zhang Qingqing immediately opened her phone and logged into Weibo. When she saw it, her face immediately turned pale. ”
