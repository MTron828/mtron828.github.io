Translator: 549690339

“Zhou Zi Yue nodded. “Alright, then you make your preparations.” ”

“”Don’t worry, I’m already prepared.” ”

“Zhou Zi Yue continued, “Don’t forget what I told you just now.” ”

“Don’t worry.”Yao Cui Fen patted her chest. “I’ll remember it all!”

“Yao Cui Fen couldn’t do anything else, but she was throwing a tantrum and pretending to be crazy. If she claimed to be number one, no one would dare to claim to be number two. ”

“”Grandpa, What About You?”Zhou Ziyue looked at ye Dafu. ”

Ye Dafu nodded. “I’m fine with it.”

“Zhou Ziyue took out her phone. “Alright, let’s begin then.” ”

Yao Cuifen immediately entered her state of mind.

“Not long after, such a video was posted online. ”

The title was: [ adopted daughter heartlessly abandons elderly parents! ]

“Such a title was too eye-catching, and it could easily cause anger in people’s hearts. ”

“An elderly couple had painstakingly raised their adopted daughter, who was completely unrelated to them, more than ten years ago. But now, their adopted daughter was rich, and she actually turned her back on them! ”

Such a person was simply not worthy of being human!

It was simply disgusting!

“On the video, Yao Cuifen was crying bitterly, “When she first came here, she was still so young and had a high fever. It was us, husband and wife, who brought her up, fed her, and clothed her. In the blink of an eye, the child had finally grown up, and she thought that we could retire peacefully, but who knew... ... who knew ... ...” ”

“Ye Dafu wanted to say something, but he hesitated. He portrayed the helplessness of a father to the fullest. ”

“In a moment, ye Dafu walked in front of Yao Cuifen and held her hand. “Forget it, children are all debts! Let’s just pretend that we never raised her...” ”

“Yao cuifen cried, “I just want to see her and hear her call me mom. Is it that difficult?” ”

“The video was not long. It had only been a few minutes, but the viewership and number of views had already exceeded 10,000. ”

[ oh my God! This adopted daughter is too vicious! She doesn’t even acknowledge her parents! ]

[ does she deserve to be human? ]

[ this is disgusting! ]

[ I beg powerful netizens to dig out this disgusting adopted daughter! ]

[ ... ]

“Zhou ziyue browsed through the comments on the internet one by one, the corners of her mouth curling up slightly. ”

“She knew very well that the influence of public opinion on the internet was powerful. With the current situation, if it continued to ferment, it might even affect the LIN Corporation. That was why Zhou Ziyue thought of such a move. ”

It was very obvious.

She had not taken the wrong step.

This was how it should be when dealing with people like ye Shu.

“Ye Sui stood beside Zhou Ziyue and said worriedly, “Ziyue, can we really do this? Just based on a video and a few comments, we can get ye Shu to obediently buy us a big villa?” ”

Why did she find this matter so mysterious?

“”Don’t worry, Mom,”Zhou Ziyue continued, “Whether it’s the Lin family or ye Shu himself, neither of them can resist the public opinion on the Internet. Once the public opinion develops to a point where it can not be controlled, then ye Shu, including the Lin Group, will pay a painful price. “On this point, this businessman, Lin Jincheng, knows better than us. He also knows better than us to stop the losses in time.” ”

Zhou Ziyue had seen too many such things.

“Really?”Ye Sui asked.

“Yes.”Zhou Ziyue nodded. “The Lin family should be very lively now.”

“Why?”

“Zhou ziyue smiled and said, “They are busy looking for connections and public relations to suppress the heat of this matter.” ”

Unfortunately.

The Lin family had overlooked many phenomena.

“In today’s society, it was no longer a society where capital could control the sky. ”

It was basically impossible for the Lin family to quietly suppress this matter and shut the mouths of the masses.

“Hearing this, Ye Sui was very worried. “The Lin family is so rich. As the saying goes, money can make the devil turn the Millstone. Ziyue...” ”

“Don’t worry too much.”Zhou Ziyue narrowed her eyes. “This is the age of traffic. So many people are watching this matter! The Lin family is nothing!”

“Zhou Ziyue was, after all, a university student. She had a wide range of knowledge and was well-organized. ”

“Hearing her words, ye Sui immediately felt relieved. He smiled and asked, “Then what should we do next?” ”

“”Wait,”Zhou Ziyue said. ”

“Wait for what?”Ye Sui asked.

“Zhou ziyue continued, “Wait for ye Shu to contact us.” ”

“What if she doesn’t contact us?”Ye Sui asked.

Zhou Ziyue’s eyes flashed. “She will contact us.”

“Ye Sui wanted to say something, but after thinking about it, he didn’t say anything. With Zhou Ziyue’s current situation, if she asked too many questions, Zhou Ziyue would definitely get impatient. ”

So he decided not to ask.

In the room next door.

“Yao Cuifen was already dreaming of making a fortune. “Old Man, how much do you think we should charge?” ”

Ye Dafu put away his phone. “I’ve checked just now. The Lin family is not an ordinary wealthy family. We need at least ten digits.”

“Like father, like daughter. ”

“Ye Sui opened his mouth and asked for nine digits. Ye Dafu was even more ruthless than ye Sui. Every time he opened his mouth, he asked for ten digits. ”

“”Ten digits?”Yao Cuifen counted with her fingers. In the end, she covered her mouth and said in surprise, “One billion?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Dafu nodded.

“Yao cuifen continued to ask, “Is the Lin family that Rich?” ”

“”One billion is just a drop in the ocean for them,”ye Dafu said. ”

“Then why don’t we ask for more?”Yao Cuifen asked.

“Ye Dafu narrowed his eyes and thought for a moment. Then he said, “When the time comes, we’ll see how things go. You should be smarter too.” ”

“With a billion dollars, they would be considered millionaires! ”

“Yao cuifen nodded repeatedly. “Don’t worry, I know what to do.” ”

“As the number of reposts and clicks of the video increased, this matter attracted a lot of attention from the media. ”

There were even people who contacted Zhou Ziyue to find out the whole story.

Zhou Ziyue avoided the main point and said a few things.

“First, her grandparents’adopted daughter was now very rich. ”

“Second, her husband’s identity was not simple. He was an important figure in the capital. ”

“Once these two points were revealed, the public opinion became more and more heated. ”

“As an important figure, he should not have done such a heartless thing! ”

“Heavens! I didn’t expect that there would be such a daughter in the 21st century!”

[ disgusting! ]

“[ it seems that there is something about the identity of the adopted daughter. After investigating for so many days, we still haven’t found out the true identity of the adopted daughter. ] ”

“[ I’m so angry! If I find out who the adopted daughter is, I’ll definitely send her a wreath! ] ”

[ count me in for sending a wreath! ]

“Just like that, two days passed. ”

“Ye Sui would hold his phone to read the comments every day and see the people reposting them. He said proudly, “Ye Shu must be worried to death right now! She never thought that we would invite your grandparents over!” ”

Zhou Ziyue was talking to the media on the phone.

“Ye Sui continued, “I have to get your dad and libang to come over as well.” ”

“Zhou Ziyue hung up the phone and looked at ye Sui, “Mom, contact ye Shu now. Tell her that no matter what, we are still a family. Let her think about what she said to her before. Otherwise, don’t blame us for not caring about our relatives.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Sui nodded and immediately opened ye Shu’s wechat.

Ye Shu had been so busy these past few days that she didn’t have time to read the news.

It wasn’t until ye Sui sent her a message that she realized what had happened.

“Seeing the ugly faces of ye Dafu and Yao Cuifen appear in the video, Ye Shu was so angry that her whole body was trembling. ”

“Lin Jincheng was reading the newspaper and continued, “I’ve already said that your sister isn’t easy to deal with. We shouldn’t have bothered with her from the beginning.” ” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“How could I have imagined that their skin would be so thick!”Ye Shu felt like she had eaten a fly.

“She originally didn’t want to care about the past, but some people were just that shameless. ”

“Lin Jincheng continued, “You don’t have to care about this.” ”

“Saying this, he paused. “I’ll handle it.” ”

“”Dad, Mom, neither of you need to handle it.”At this moment, a clear and shallow voice appeared in the air. ”

Lin Jincheng and ye Shu turned around. It was ye Zhuo.

“Zhuo Zhuo.”

“Lin Jincheng said, “Your identity is special now. It’s not appropriate for you to interfere in this matter. Let Me Do It!” ”

“Ye Zhuo’s face was expressionless. He continued, “We don’t need to care about this matter. Let it ferment naturally.” ”

Rumors stopped at wise men.

“There were many things that even if ye Dafu and Yao Cuifen could hide for a while, the internet had memories. ”

“You don’t Care?”Lin Jincheng didn’t react in time.

“”Really, really don’t Care?”Ye Shu asked. ”

“Really.”Ye Zao nodded.

“After saying that, Ye Zao looked at Ye Shu, then, he said, “Mom, there are some things that you can look down on and you can see clearly, but that can only represent you personally. You have to know that not everyone is like you. “Also, when a person’s heart is not enough, the snake will swallow the elephant.” ”

“For those top-notch relatives, the only way was to completely sever ties. ”

“Otherwise, they would be bloodsucking worms with no bottom line. They would suck blood while not being satisfied. ”

“Ye Shu nodded. “Okay, I got it.” ”
