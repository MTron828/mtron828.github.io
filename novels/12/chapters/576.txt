Translator: 549690339

“She and Old Lady Lin were like mother and daughter, but Old Lady Lin actually hit her now. ”

Was it because she could not have children?

But was it her fault that she could not have children?

Having children was not something that she could decide.

Old Lady Lin was very regretful now. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Very regretful.

She regretted not dragging Lin Qingxuan to a few more hospitals for a checkup back then.

She regretted even more that she had made the decision to marry Zhao shining to Lin Qingxuan back then.

It was all her fault.

She was the one who had misjudged people and ruined Lin Qingxuan’s life.

“Tears instantly flowed down Madam Lin’s face. “Divorce! Divorce Now! You B * Tch, get out of our Lin family right now!” ”

Divorce?

No.

She could not divorce Lin Qingxuan.

She was already forty-three years old this year.

She could not be compared to those young girls.

“If she divorced Lin Qingxuan, where could she go? ”

Could she find a man more outstanding than Lin Qingxuan?

She had been the fourth wife of the Lin family for twenty-one years.

How could she live if she suddenly left the Lin family and Lin Qingxuan?

“Zhao shuning cried as she hugged Old Lady Lin’s leg, “Mom, please forgive me! Please forgive me! I didn’t do it on purpose. I was just too afraid of leaving this family and Qingxuan. Please forgive me this time! I’ll be your slave from now on!” ”

“”Mom! I’m begging you! Please forgive me! On account that we’re all from the Zhao family, please forgive me!” ”

“She was from the same family as Old Lady Lin, so Old Lady Lin definitely couldn’t bear for her to divorce Lin Qingxuan. ”

“As long as Old Lady Lin was willing to forgive her, Lin Qingxuan had no choice but to forgive her. ”

“”B * Tch! You Don’t deserve to have the surname Zhao! Our Old Zhao family doesn’t have someone as evil as you!”Old Lady Lin shook off Zhao shuning, “Get out of Here! Get out of Here Right Now!” ”

Old Lady Lin’s heart was truly cold.

“Thinking about the grievances that Lin Qingxuan had suffered in front of Zhao shuning all these years, Old Lady Lin’s heart ached terribly. ”

That was her son.

The son that she had been pregnant with for ten months!

Her son had actually been tormented like this by a B * tch like Zhao shuning who was full of lies!

Old Lady Lin even had the heart to kill Zhao Shuning at this moment.

She only hated that there was no medicine for regret in this world!

“Zhao shuning was thrown to the ground and cried out, “Mom! Please forgive me for once on account of me following Qingxuan for so many years! Qingxuan and I are husband and wife, and I have been bearing the blame for Qingxuan for so many years...” ”

“Old Lady Lin was instantly enraged. Her gaze was as if she wanted to eat Zhao shuning up, “B * Tch! Shut Up! You still have the cheek to say that! It’s obvious that you don’t know how to give birth! Yet you still want to pour dirty water on our Qingxuan! You venomous woman with a venomous heart! Do you want to watch our Qingxuan be cut off before you’re satisfied?” ”

Zhao shuning looked at Old Lady Lin with tears in her eyes.

It was as if the mother-daughter relationship in the past was a joke.

“She and Old Lady Lin usually had such a good relationship. Once she learned the truth, she would become the B * Tch and vicious woman that Old Lady Lin spoke of... ”

Should she leave the Lin family just like that?

No.

Zhao shuning was unwilling.

“She was truly unwilling. Even if she did not know how to have children, it was not a lie that she had sacrificed twenty-one years of her youth for Lin Qingxuan. ”

Lin Qingxuan could not be so heartless.

“Zhao shuning moved to Lin Qingxuan’s side and tugged at his pants. “Qingxuan, we’re husband and wife after all. You Can’t be so heartless! You Can’t abandon me! You said that you would never divorce me!” ”

Lin Qingxuan just looked at Zhao shuning. There wasn’t a hint of emotion in his voice. “Get a divorce. Stop fooling around! Leave some dignity for both of us!”

He and Zhao Shuning had been husband and wife for twenty-one years.

Lin Qingxuan didn’t want to make things ugly.

The expression on Zhao shuning’s face was slowly turning stiff. “Do you really have to be so heartless?”

“Didn’t you look for a reason for why we’ve come this far?”

“Zhao shuning roared angrily, “But didn’t I do all of this for you?”She did it because she cared about Lin Jin city! ”

She cared very much.

She made up a lie because she was afraid of losing it.

She did all of this because she loved Lin Qingxuan.

Why couldn’t Lin Qingxuan love her back?

“Old Mrs. Lin ordered the servants beside her, “Pack up this B * Tch’s things! Tell her to scram back to the Zhao family immediately!” ”

“Okay.”A servant immediately went to do it.

“Qingxuan...”

Lin Qingxuan turned her head.

The servants quickly packed up Zhao Shuning’s things.
