Translator: 549690339

“Zhou Yuelian had already asked around very carefully. That young lady was a very rare good girl. Whether it was her family background or her knowledge, she was worthy of Ye Sen. ”

Matchmaking also had to pay attention to social status. Zhou Yuelian was not the kind of person who would randomly introduce someone to others.

“There were many relatives in Zhou Yuelian’s family who wanted her to introduce her daughter to Ye Sen, but Zhou Yuelian did not agree. Because they were relatives, she understood their purpose! ”

“Ye Shu was so good to her, so she could not introduce ye Sen to a troublemaker! ”

“At the end of her sentence, Zhou Yuelian stood up and said, “I’d better tell your mother myself!” ”

“As soon as she finished speaking, Zhou Yuelian called Ye Shu. ”

“Soon, the call was connected. ”

“”Hello, Ah Shu.” ”

“Sister Lian.”

“After the two of them greeted each other, Zhou Yuelian went straight to the point. “Ah Shu, has Zhuozhuo told you already? I have an especially good young lady here who I want to introduce to ye Sen.” ”

“”Sure!”! I happen to be quite anxious about him too! He’s almost forty years old, and I still have no idea where he is! Right, Sister Lian, what’s the situation with the young lady you’re talking about? Is she also from Yun Jing? Although ye Shu has now settled down in the capital, she still missed her days in Yun Jing very much. ”

“If ye Sen could find a girlfriend in Yun Jing, that would naturally be the best. Of course, the most important thing in such matters still depended on fate. ”

“Zhou Yuelian said, “She’s from Yun Jing. She used to be a doctor at Yun Jing’s first People’s Hospital. She was transferred to the capital last year! “I was thinking, aren’t they all in the capital? “It’s convenient for them to meet. Then the little girl has an elder sister, and then her parents!” ”

“Ye Shu liked the profession of doctor very much. She smiled and said, “Okay, I’ll ask ye Sen.” ”

“”Okay.”Zhou Yuelian continued, “Go and ask him. If Ye Sen thinks it’s okay, I’ll get the little girl’s wechat. The two of them can chat on wechat first. After that, we’ll meet again.” ”

“”By the way, you haven’t told me how old the girl is this year!”Ye Shu continued to ask. ”

“”28 years old,”Zhou Yuelian said. ”

Ye Sen was 37 years old this year. There was a difference of nine years between the two of them.

“It was fine for a man to be older than a woman. Ye Shu did not care about these age issues, ”

“after hanging up the phone, she immediately called Ye Sen. ”

“When ye Sen heard that Ye Shu was going to introduce a partner to her, he felt his scalp go numb. “Sister, I don’t want to find a partner yet, so don’t worry about it!” ” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“”Am I worrying about it? Ye Sen, you’re 37 this year, not 17!”Ye Shu continued, “Don’t wait until burning and Shaoqing have their wedding. You’re still alone!” ”

“Then.., ye Shu continued, “You guys add on wechat first. If you feel that you can chat together, then meet up. I heard from sister Lian that the woman works in Beijing and is a doctor! And that girl is nine years younger than you! You’re 37 and she’s 28. No matter what, you’re still taking advantage of her!” ”

“What’s there to chat about with a person I’ve never met? Isn’t it awkward?”Ye Sen asked.

“What’s there to be awkward about? Don’t people get to know each other after not knowing each other?”Ye Shu said.

“Ye Sen said, “No, no, no. I’m begging you, just leave me alone!” ”

“”If you want to meet and talk again,”ye Shu said, “I can ask sister Lian to arrange for you to meet immediately. How about tomorrow? Tomorrow happens to be Saturday. Everyone has time! “If you’re embarrassed by yourself, I can go with you! “I can also help you take a look.” ”

“When ye Shu said this, she was already planning what she would wear when she met the woman the next day. ”

“”SIS, what are you talking about! Why are we meeting? ! I have a meeting right now, so I won’t talk to you for now. I’m Hanging Up!”After saying this, Ye Sen hurriedly hung up the phone. ”

Ye Shu looked at the phone that was hung up. “It’s really worrying!”

“After hanging up the phone with Ye Sen, Ye Shu returned a call to Zhou Yuelian, “Sister Lian, I’m really sorry. Ye Sen said that he doesn’t want to look for a girlfriend for the time being. Why Don’t you help him keep an eye out for her? When he comes to his senses, I’ll tell you again!” ”

“Zhou Yuelian smiled and said, “Alright!”! If Ye Sen doesn’t want to look for a girlfriend now, I’ll introduce the little girl to others! Ah Shu, we’ve been good sisters for many years. Let me tell you something from the bottom of my heart. This little girl’s conditions are really good. I’ve seen pictures of her and she’s also good-looking! I really can’t bear to introduce her to others! However, Ye Sen and her aren’t fated. There’s nothing we can do about it!” ”
