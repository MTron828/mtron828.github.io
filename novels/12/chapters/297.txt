Disappeared without a trace.

Not even a letter.

Since he disappeared.

That woman had not come again.

If Lin Ze was really his child.

Then.

His biological mother must be that woman at that time.

Nineteen years old.

The age was just right.

“This child also took the top scorer exam and taught the child so well. All these years, he must have been very happy, right? ”

Ye Shu closed her eyes and let out a light breath.

She didn’t know what was wrong with her either.

She thought so much when she saw a child.

“Perhaps, this child had nothing to do with him? ”

Forget it!

The past had passed so long ago.

Let It Pass!

“Ye Shu adjusted her emotions and walked to the kitchen. However, when she turned around, she returned to her usual smiling face and chatted with the employees as if that scene had never happened before. ”

At the same time.

In Yunjing.

“Lin Ze didn’t know if it was because of the bond between mother and son, but he also turned on the television. It happened to be the Yunjing television station. ”

The screen was showing the reporters interviewing ye Shu.

“”Hello, number one mom. Do you have any parenting tips to share with the viewers in front of the television?” ”

Lin Ze was eating an apple.

When he saw ye Shu on the television.

He was suddenly stunned.

This feeling was very strange.

“He clearly didn’t know ye Shu, but he subconsciously felt that he had known this aunt for a long time. ”

A bitter smile appeared on the corner of Lin Ze’s mouth.

He had been living in a single-parent family for a long time.

No matter who he met.

He felt that that person was his mother.

How could it be so coincidental.

“He turned on a TV casually, and the person on the TV was his biological mother? ”

“Meow.”The Fat Cat in his arms seemed to have sensed its owner’s mood and raised its head to Meow.

Lin Ze rubbed the cat’s head.

Feng Qianhua walked in from outside and saw this scene on the television.

Who was the person on the television?

Ye Shu?

It was actually her!

“Feng Qianhua narrowed her eyes and immediately took a few steps back. She said to old madam Lin, “Aunt Lin, I saw Sister Ye Shu on the news.” ”

“What news could she be on?”Old Mrs. Lin’s face was full of disdain.

How could a promiscuous woman be qualified to appear on television?

“If she was going to be on the news, it would definitely be negative news! ”

“Feng Qianhua continued, “I’m not too sure about the specific news. Look, Ah Ze is really sitting there watching!” ”

Lin Ze was sitting there watching?

Old Mrs. Lin was shocked!

She absolutely could not let Lin Ze see ye Shu!

She absolutely could not let Lin ze suspect anything!

Lin Ze was her eldest grandson and had nothing to do with that B * Tch Ye Shu.

She was not fit to be Lin Ze’s mother!

“Old Mrs. Lin panicked and hurriedly said, “Auntie Zhang! Auntie Zhang!” ”

“”I’m here, Old Mrs. Lin.” ”

Old Mrs. Lin tried her best to keep her voice low. “Quick! Quick! Get Someone to cut off the power!”

“Okay!”Aunt Zhang immediately went to do it.

PA —

Lin Ze was watching the news.

The television screen suddenly disappeared.

The power went out?

“There was a generator at home that could provide power 24 hours a day. If the power really went out, the higher-ups would definitely notify them in advance and the Butler would also make arrangements. ”

Why did the power suddenly go out?

Lin Ze frowned slightly.

He had a vague feeling that something was not right.

At this moment.

“Old Mrs. Lin walked in with Feng Qianhua and her daughter, chatting and laughing. ”

“Grandma.”Lin Ze directly ignored Feng Qianhua.

Feng Qianhua did not feel awkward and greeted Lin ze with a smile. “Ah Ze is at home.”

“Lin Ze replied casually and then looked at Old Mrs. Lin. “Grandma, is there a power outage at home?” ”

“Old Mrs. Lin said, “It seems like the power line is broken. It’s being repaired now.” ”

“”OH.”Lin Ze nodded. He put down the cat in his arms and picked up the phone on the table. “Grandma, I’m going out for a while.” ”

“Old Mrs. Lin instructed, “Come home early for dinner tonight.” ”

“Got it.”

“The owner left, leaving the fat cat lying on the sofa. ”

Feng Xianxian disliked such small animals the most. She walked over and kicked the cat. “Why would brother Ah Ze keep such a wild cat?”

“Meow!”The Fat Cat whimpered after being kicked and quickly ran upstairs.

Old Lady Lin also disliked this cat. “Who knows what that child Ah Ze is thinking!”

“In Old Lady Lin’s eyes, this was just an unpresentable country cat. ”

“If she really wanted to raise it, she should also raise a valuable Persian cat. ”

“If outsiders saw this kind of local cat, wouldn’t they laugh at the Lin family’s shabbiness? ”

Feng Xianxian was the closest to the Lin family.

“From Feng Xianxian’s reaction, one could tell that she definitely wouldn’t raise such a low-class local cat. ”

“If it weren’t for Lin Ze who had just gotten the top scorer and won Old Lady Lin’s favor, Old Lady Lin would have gotten rid of this cat long ago. ” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Lin Ze walked out of the manor and saw the butler instructing the gardener to trim the plants in front of the door. He asked casually, “Grandpa Butler, when will the wiring in the house be fixed?” ”

“The Butler was stunned for a moment before he smiled and said, “It will be fixed soon.” ”

Lin Ze nodded.

Ten minutes later.

Lin Ze arrived at the secret base of the four of them.

“Dog Two, fat tiger, and Li Wen had already arrived. ”

“Seeing Lin ze come over, Li Wen said excitedly, “Brother Ze! Brother ZE, quickly come and watch this video! It’s So Cool!” ”

“What video?”Lin Ze walked over.

This was a video of a car driving.

“The car in the video was clearly a coach car, and the venue was also a driving school’s S-bend. However, the driver had driven out of the car race track to see the scene. ”

Drift!

Jump and slide!

These difficult movements were more and more thrilling.

It made people’s blood boil!

“If they had not seen it with their own eyes, no one would have believed that a coach car could play so many tricks. ”

“Lin Ze liked cars very much, and at this moment, he could not take his eyes off them. ”

It had to be said.

This driver was indeed amazing!

“Lin Ze had watched many racing competitions, but he had never seen anyone with such good skills! ”

“Who is this? A new dark horse in the racing world?”Lin Ze asked.

Li Wen shook his head. “I don’t know him either. This is a video that suddenly became popular a while ago. I heard that this person is a driving school student.”

Dog Two was stunned. “Student? Really?”

“”I saw the person who posted the video say so,”Li Wen continued, “It says here that he’s a student from the Yun Jing Driving School!” ”

Yun Jing.

“When he heard these two words, Lin Ze’s eyes lit up. He continued, “I plan to make another trip to Yun Jing in the near future.” ”

“Fat tiger exclaimed, “Brother Ze, you’re still going? Aren’t you afraid that your grandmother will scold you?” ”

“Lin Ze’s expression was indifferent. “She scolded me because my mother is in yunjing, so I have to go!” ”
