Translator: 549690339

“”Miss Bai, I’ll have to Trouble You Then. I’m going to look for Miss Ye. I’ll be back soon!”After saying that, Jin Ling turned around and left. ”

“Looking at Jin Ling’s back, the corners of Bai Mo’s mouth curled up into a proud smile. ”

“Although Jin Ling did not say anything, looking at Jin Ling’s appearance, she could guess what had happened inside. ”

Bai Jingshu must have eaten the pastry.

Jin Ling wanted to look for Ye Zhuo?

Bai Jingshu must have done something ugly inside before she could find ye Zhuo.

But that was good.

She could let ye Zhuo see how Bai Jingshu would behave in front of others.

She wanted to see how Bai Jingshu would stand in the Lin family after such a scandal.

The Lin family was a big family in the capital. They couldn’t tolerate such a wicked daughter-in-law.

“As for Lin Ze, as a man, how could he let Bai Jingshu put on a hat for him? ”

Of course not

“Jin Ling took a few steps forward and seemed to have thought of something. She turned back to look at Bai Mo and instructed, “Miss Bai, please don’t let anyone into the dressing room!” ”

“Bai Mo nodded and continued, “Don’t worry, Miss Bai. I Won’t let anyone in.” ”

“Seeing that she kept calling her Missy, Jin ling continued, “My surname is Jin, Jin Ling. Jin of Jin, Ling of the Elves. Missy Bai, you can call me Jin Ling. I’ll be right back!” ”

“”Okay.”Bai Mo continued, “Missy Jin Ling, you should go now! I’ll wait for you at the door!” ”

“After confirming that Bai Mo would not leave or enter the dressing room, Jin Ling quickly ran to look for ye Zao. ”

Bai Jingshu said that only ye Zao could resolve this matter.

“Although it was Jin Ling’s first time meeting ye Zao, and Bai Jingshu did not introduce ye Zao in detail, she could tell that ye Zao was not an ordinary person. ”

“Bai Mo stood at the door. When Jin Ling was far away, she pushed open the door to the dressing room and walked into the room. ”

The dressing room was very quiet.

“The bright crystal lights swayed above her head, making her feel dizzy. ”

“However, Bai Mo didn’t realize it at the moment. ”

She was too excited to realize it.

“On the other hand, she really wanted to see Bai Jingshu lose face. ”

“Whenever she thought about that scene, Bai Mo felt very excited. ”

“After waiting for so long, she finally waited for Bai Jingshu to get her retribution. ”

“”Sis,”Bai Mo called out. ”

There was no response from Bai Jingshu in the room.

How could there be no response?

Bai Mo narrowed her eyes.

“Sis?”

There was still no response.

Bai Mo continued to walk a few more steps.

Where did Bai Jingshu go?

“At this moment, Bai Mo’s gaze was suddenly attracted to a curled up figure under the sofa. ”

It was Bai Jingshu.

Bai Mo smiled and walked over. “Sis.” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The curled-up figure under the sofa did not answer Bai Mo. .

“Bai Mo did not stop and continued to walk forward. Then, she squatted down in front of Bai Jingshu and said gently, “SIS, What’s wrong with you? Are you not feeling well?” ”

“Bai Jingshu squatted on the ground, her entire body trembling. ”

“Bai Mo looked at her, his eyes filled with sympathy. “SIS, do you need me to find a doctor for you?” ”

“”No, no need.”Bai Jingshu raised her head. “Why are you here?” ”

“Bai Mo asked incredulously when he saw that Bai Jingshu was sweating profusely. “SIS, What’s wrong? Why are you sweating so much?” ”

“Bai Jingshu took a deep breath. “It’s the latest aphrodisiac. Bai Mo, do you dare to say that you have nothing to do with this?” ”

This kind of drug was only available in the s galaxy.

She never dreamed that Bai Mo would do such a thing at her wedding.

Bai Mo wanted to ruin her.

“”SIS, what are you talking about? I don’t understand!”Bai Mo looked like she didn’t understand anything. ”

“”Stop pretending. It’s You, isn’t it?”Bai Jingshu restrained the discomfort in her body. “You want me to make a fool of myself today!” ”

Make a fool of myself?

How could it be as simple as making a fool of myself?

Bai Jingshu was really innocent and cute.

“Lin Ze was also blind. Otherwise, even if he found a replacement, he wouldn’t have chosen a fool like Bai Jingshu. ”

“Bai Mo snorted in her heart and smiled innocently. “SIS, you’ve misunderstood. We’re sisters. Why would I do this to you?” ”

“”Bai Mo, I’m your sister! We share the same blood!”Bai Jingshu raised her head and looked at Bai mo. “Do you even have any humanity in you? !” ”

“This sentence really provoked Bai Mo. Bai Mo looked at Bai Jingshu with a vicious look in his eyes and decided to stop pretending, he said angrily, “Bai Jingshu, do you know that we’re biological sisters? But why didn’t you think of that when you stole my boyfriend? Aren’t you ashamed of yourself?” ”
