She had just heard the entire conversation in the ward.

“Before this, she still had one percent of hope for her biological parents, but now, she had completely given up on them. ”

“”Pingting, don’t be angry! You’re Mom and Dad’s daughter. You’ll always be mom and Dad’s good daughter!”Mother Zhao hugged Zhao Pingting with heartache. ”

“Father Zhao wiped away his tears. “Alright, let’s go in quickly.” ”

“Zhao Pingting looked at her parents. “Mom and dad, I want you to promise me that you’ll never look for them again. Otherwise, I won’t treat this illness anymore!” ”

“Hearing this, Zhao Pingting’s parents were shocked and quickly said, “Okay, okay, okay! Pingting, Mom and dad promise you that we’ll never look for them again.” ”

Only then did Zhao Pingting follow her parents to the ward.

“Just as she walked into the ward, Zhao Pingting received a wechat message. ”

It was from an Lizi.

“[ Pingting, are you free on Saturday? Let’s go to Binhai together with searing? I heard that the scenery of Binhai is really good! ] ”

“Zhao Pingting hesitated for a moment and sent a line of text over. [ sorry, Lizi, I might not be able to go. ] ”

[ missed another appointment? [ dog head ][ knock ]

“[ I’m sick, lung cancer is in the middle and late stage. ] ”

[ ? ? ? ]

[ stop joking! ]

“The next second, an Lizi’s video call came in. ”

Zhao Pingting picked up the video call. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Seeing that Zhao Pingting was actually wearing a hospital gown, an lizi said in shock, “Pingting, you really...” ”

Zhao Pingting smiled and nodded.

...

At the Ye residence.

“Ye Zhuo was sitting on the floor, studying the circuit board when his phone suddenly rang. ”

“”Xiao Bai, help me get my phone.” ”

“”Master, you have to call me Xiao Bai from now on.”Xiao Bai swiped his phone over. ”

“Ye Zhuo used his shoulder to hold the phone. His left and right hands pinched a line on the circuit board, preparing to connect it. “Hello, Hello.” ”

“Zao Zao.”An Lizi’s voice came from the other side.

“”Lizi, what’s the matter?” ”

“An Lizi’s voice sounded very unpleasant. “Zao Zao, it’s not good. Pingting has lung cancer and is currently in the hospital. Are you free? Let’s go and see her together.” ”

Lung Cancer?

So what if she had lung cancer.

Wouldn’t she be fine after a surgery and an injection?

What was there to be afraid of?

“Ye Zhuo raised her eyebrows slightly. At this moment, she suddenly remembered that this was no longer the world she lived in. ”

It was here.

“Once she got cancer, it was equivalent to being sentenced to death. ”

Because cancer was here and there was no cure.

“Thinking of this, Ye Zhuo hurriedly put down the circuit board in his hand. “Which hospital is Pingting in now?” ”

“”The first People’s Hospital of Yunjing City,”an Lizi answered. ”

Ye Zao stood up. “Then let’s meet at the entrance of the hospital.”

“Okay.”

“After hanging up the phone, ye Zao took off the white gloves in his hand and brushed the black hair that had fallen to the side of his face behind his ears. Then, he took out a backpack from the cabinet and checked that everything was inside before he walked out. ”

“As he walked, he said, “Book me a ride on the Internet. I want to go to the first People’s hospital in Yun Jing City.” ”

“Little white immediately said, “Yes, Master!” ”

“Ten seconds later, little white continued, “Master, the ride on the Internet has been booked. It’s a Red Volkswagen with the license plate number: YUN A6235.” ”

“”Got it.”Walking to the door, Ye Zhuo picked up the black cap hanging on the wall and put it on his head. ”

“The long brim of the cap covered her eyes, leaving only the High Bridge of her nose, her bright red lips, and her delicate chin. ”

She was originally white.

Her jade-like skin looked even more black and white under the contrast of the cap.

It was so cool!

“Little White sent her out. “Master, have a safe trip. Your Dear Little White is waiting for you at home.” ”

Ye Zhuo waved at Xiao Bai without turning his head.

“Just as he walked out of the door, he saw the red online car-hailing. ”

Ye Zhuo opened the backseat door and leaned in.

“She was wearing a hat. The driver could only see a jade-like chin. Although his face could not be seen, the driver still felt that this little girl was not simple. ”

This temperament.

Could an ordinary person have it?

“The driver started the engine and asked, “Little girl, are you going to the first People’s Hospital?” ”

“Yes.”

“Alright! Let’s set off immediately!”

This place was a little far from the first People’s Hospital of Yunjing City.

“When ye Zao got off the car, he saw an lizi holding flowers and fruit baskets, standing there waiting for her. ”

“Perhaps because ye Zao was wearing a hat, an Lizi did not recognize him. ”

It was not until ye Zao walked to Anlizi’s side and called her name that Anlizi reacted. “Zao Zao!”
