Translator: 549690339

Ye Zhuo told his parents about this matter.

Lin Jincheng and ye Shu were quite surprised when they heard it.

No one expected that Cen Shaoqing’s father was still alive.

“Ye Shu sighed, “The most pitiful one is your aunt Xiang. She gave the Cen family the best years of a woman’s life, but Shaoqing’s father treated her like this.” ”

At least Lin Jincheng didn’t marry another woman back then.

But Cen Haifeng...

“No matter how one looked at it, he had already betrayed Zhou Xiang ”

“Lin Jincheng had some friendship with Cen Haifeng. He continued, “Zhonghua, are you sure that’s Shaoqing’s father?” ”

“”Yes.”Ye Zhonghua nodded slightly, “The results of the appraisal are out, but the specific reason is still uncertain. Cen Shaoqing and I have decided to make a trip there in the near future. After we’ve investigated everything, we’ll tell Aunt Xiang and grandmother Cen about this news.” ”

“”Yes,”Lin Jincheng continued, “We really have to figure out what happened first. When are you going to leave?” ”

“”The exact time hasn’t been decided yet, but it should be within these few days.” ”

“Ye Shu asked, “Will you be able to see Xiao Han on this trip?” ”

“”Yes,”ye Zao said. ”

“Ye Shu continued, “Tell Xiao Han to come back more often when he has time. By the way, he likes to eat my dried fruits. When I make more dried fruits in the evening, you can bring them to him.” ”

“Okay.”

“Lin Jincheng continued to ask, “By the way, how long will it take for you to come back?” ”

“”At least three days, at most three to five months.” ”

“”That long?”Ye Zhuo had just come back, and now he had to leave for so long. As a father, he naturally couldn’t bear to part with his child. ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Ye Shu said, “Then I’ll prepare more things for you to bring. Little Han said that there’s nothing to eat in their country of Changyue!” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Alright, I’ll bring everything along then.” ”

On the other side.

At the CEN residence.

“When she saw Cen Shaoqing return, old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “Why are you back so early today?” ”

“CEN Shaoqing said, “I didn’t have anything to do in the afternoon, so I accompanied Zao to go out for a stroll.” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “You should go out for a stroll more often. Otherwise, with your boring character, sooner or later, Ye Zi will be swindled away by other big pig trotters!” ”

“Where’s My Mother?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“”She went to the eldest servant girl’s place,”Old Mrs. Cen answered. ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Old Mrs. Cen looked at Cen Shaoqing and then said, “Fifth, Shaoqing, why do I feel that you seem strange today? Did Something Happen?” ”

“”No,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“Really?”Old Mrs. Cen narrowed her eyes. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“”Really.”Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads and continued, “I’m going back upstairs.” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen looked at Cen Shaoqing’s back and muttered, “Did you have a fight with Yezi?” ”

She thought about it and felt a little worried. Old Mrs. Cen picked up her phone and sent a video to Ye Zao.

Ye Zao quickly picked up. “Grandma Cen.”

“”Yezi, have you eaten?”Old Mrs. Cen asked. ”

Ye Zao nodded slightly. “I’ve eaten with Shaoqing outside. What About You?”

“”I’ve eaten too.”Old madam CEN continued, “Yezi, let me tell you. If that brat fifth lass dares to bully you, you must tell Grandma that Grandma will back you up! If it really doesn’t work out, I’ll dump him! “Yezi, you’re so good-looking. What kind of handsome guy can’t you find? You Don’t have to hang yourself on a crooked tree like him!” ”

“Ye Zao chuckled. “Grandma Cen, did you misunderstand something? Shaoqing and I are very good. He didn’t bully me. Besides, I have you to support me! How would he dare to Bully Me!” ”

“”It’s good that he didn’t bully me.”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “I saw that he didn’t look right when he came back today. I thought something happened.” ”

“”Nothing happened. Grandma Cen, you don’t have to worry. Don’t you understand fifth girl? She’s always wearing an icy face. It’s like someone owes him millions!”Ye Zao said with a smile. ”

“Hearing this, Old Mrs. Cen nodded. “That’s true.” ”

“After chatting with ye Zao for a while, she cut to the video. ”

“Although ye Zao said nothing happened, old Mrs. Cen felt that the two of them were hiding something from her. However, she couldn’t think of anything, so she simply stopped thinking about it. ”

In the gym on the third floor.

Cen Shaoqing was wearing boxing gloves and boxing with a robot.

Every move was fatal.

Bang Bang Bang!

The professional boxing robot was knocked to the ground again and again.

“The man’s upper body was naked, revealing his fair skin and well-defined muscles. Every time he punched, he was full of strength, and his whole body was emitting the scent of hormones that belonged exclusively to men. ”
