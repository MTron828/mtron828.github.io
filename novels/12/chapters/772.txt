Translator: 549690339

“Special assistant Liu said, “Boss is preparing to settle down in the capital in the future, and the headquarters has already moved to the center of the capital.””

Settle down?

“Hearing this, song Chenyu suddenly raised his head.”

The song family’s ancestral business was in Yun Jing.

Song Shiyu’s sudden decision to come to the capital was really puzzling.

Could it be that song Shiyu had come for her?

He was worried that she would stay in the capital alone.

“After all, she had previously said in front of Song Shiyu that she would stay in the capital to develop and would not return to Yunjing in the future.”

At the thought of this.

Song Chenyu was exceptionally happy.

Song Shiyu had actually moved the song group’s headquarters to the capital for her!

How many older brothers in this world could do what song Shiyu did?

She knew that song Shiyu still had a little sister in his heart.

“In her opinion, Song Shiyu was a crazy person who spoiled his sister.”

Although song Shiyu had just slapped her.

That was because she had touched the relic of Song Shiyu’s birth mother.

“When song Shiyu was young, he had even witnessed the tragic death of his birth mother.”

“This made him unable to let go of it, and it was also a thorn in song Shiyu’s heart.”

“Therefore, song Chenyu could understand song Shiyu!”

Song Chenyu raised his head to look at special assistant Liu. “Are you sure that third brother has moved the Song Empire’s headquarters here?”

“Yes.”Special Assistant Liu nodded. “The headquarters has officially started operating.”

“Song Chenyu was very excited. He picked up the ointment on the table and applied it evenly on his face. Then, he said, “Special Assistant Liu, go get someone to buy some vegetables. I want to personally cook for third brother.””

Special Assistant Liu was stunned.

Didn’t song Shiyu Just Slap Song Chenyu?

Song Chenyu wasn’t angry at all?

“Instead, he wanted to cook for Song Shiyu?”

“Hurry up and go! What are you waiting for!”Song Chenyu urged Special Assistant Liu.

“Special Assistant Liu nodded. “Okay, I’ll go right away.””

Special Assistant Liu immediately arranged for people to buy vegetables.

“Soon, the uncle in charge of purchasing the vegetables came back.”

“Song Chenyu personally cooked. After working for more than two hours, he finally finished cooking a table full of dishes.”

The dishes were delicious.

“After cooking, song Chenyu went upstairs and knocked on song Shiyu’s door.”

“Third brother.”

There was no response in the room.

“Song Chenyu continued, “Third brother, I’m sorry. I was wrong just now. I shouldn’t have randomly searched through your things. I didn’t do it on purpose. Can you forgive me?””

“”Third brother, I was wrong. I really was wrong. Please forgive me.””

“No matter how song Chenyu spoke outside, there was still no sound from inside.”

“Just as song Chenyu thought that the door would not open, the door was opened from inside.”

“Third brother!”Song Chenyu raised his head in joy.

Song Shiyu’s face was still expressionless. There seemed to be a layer of frost between his brows. “You’re not allowed to enter my room in the future.”

“Song Chenyu was stunned at first, then he said, “Okay.””

“”Third brother, I’ve made dinner. Do you want to go down and eat?”Song Chenyu continued to ask.”

“”I’m not hungry.”After saying this, song Shiyu directly closed the door.”

Song Chenyu looked at the closed door and was not angry.

Because she understood song Shiyu’s habits.

“After all, Song Shiyu had always been a cold-blooded and heartless person.”

She was already very excited that song Shiyu was willing to come to the capital for her.

“She only needed to know that song Shiyu had a little sister in his heart, and that was enough.”

“Song Chenyu smiled, turned around, and walked downstairs.”

...

The Liu family.

“Mother Liu brought a cup of tea for Liu Caiyi and casually asked, “I heard that you recently groomed a pretty good young lady named Feng?”If Liu Caiyi wanted to go far in the world of traditional Chinese painting, she had to cultivate her own power, she had to get more people’s support.”

“Liu Caiyi took the tea and said with a frown, “Don’t mention it.””

“Seeing that Liu Caiyi’s expression was not right, mother Liu asked curiously, “What’s going on?””

“Liu Caiyi took a sip of the tea. “That Feng Xianxian is a fool like a pig!”When she first met Feng Xianxian, Liu Caiyi also felt that she had met a thousand-mile horse.”

She even planned to seek justice for Feng Xianxian. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“After all, she was a person with a strong sense of justice.”

Who knew that Feng Xianxian was a waste!

“Even though she knew the answer, she only got 60 marks.”

And it made her waste more than three months of her time!

“Mother Liu smiled and said, “Alright, don’t be angry. I heard that your Chinese arts association is about to run for president. How are your preparations going?””

Although there was only one word between the vice president and the president.

There was a huge difference in treatment.

“Liu Caiyi continued, “Second elder has always had a good impression of me. Moreover, she also said that she would recommend me to the president. I think it should be about right.””
