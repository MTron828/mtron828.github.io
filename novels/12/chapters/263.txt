Translator: 549690339

Even the assistant and secretary were men.

“In Ye Zao’s eyes, Cen Shaoqing was a pure and unsullied person with no emotions. ”

“What if you successfully make him fall in love with you?”An Lizi asked.

“”It’s impossible,”ye Zao said. “We’re just friends.” ”

How could a person without emotions fall in love with him?

What kind of joke was this?

“An Lizi narrowed her eyes, “Based on my years of reading novels, this matter is definitely not simple. He must have fallen in love with you! Do you know, Zao Zao? If you like someone, you can’t hide your eyes! He has you in his eyes. Do you understand that feeling?” ”

“Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly. “He’s not blind. It would be abnormal if he didn’t have me in his eyes, right?” ”

An Lizi:”...”

This sentence was so reasonable that she couldn’t refute it.

“An Lizi sighed and shook her head helplessly. “Sigh, I can’t even explain it to a single dog like you.” ”

“After saying that, an lizi continued, “Zao, let me say, if... If he fell in love with you and confessed his feelings for you, what would you do? Would you accept him and marry him?” ”

“Ye Zhuozhuo’s tone was indifferent. “This kind of thing can not happen to him and me. Lizi, don’t think about this nonsense.” ”

An Lizi pursed her lips. “That’s hard to say. What If it happens? What if you two see eye to eye?”

“Never.”Ye Zhuozhuo enunciated each word.

“An lizi smiled and said, “Do you know the definition of true fragrance?” ”

“”The definition of true fragrance is useless to me.”Although ye Zao had a good impression of Cen Shaoqing, it was only a good impression. ”

Cen Shaoqing was also a monk.

How could the two of them see eye to eye?

“Even if Mars collided with earth, such a thing would not happen. ”

An Lizi continued to explain the definition of true fragrance to ye Zao.

The two of them talked as they walked.

“In a short while, they arrived at the amusement park’s tourist area. ”

“Today was Sunday, and there were a lot of tourists inside. ”

“Seeing all kinds of fun, an Lizi forgot the definition of true fragrance. She said excitedly, “Zao Zao! Let’s go play the roller coaster first! Then we’ll play the jumper. And I want to play the roller coaster too!” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded.

“In his previous life, Ye Zao was an orphan. He could only look at the parents of other children with envy as they took them to the amusement park to play. ”

When she grew up.

“When she had the ability, she suddenly had no desire to go. ”

So.

This was the first time ye Zao came to the amusement park.

“Whether it was a roller coaster, a roller coaster, or a jumper, she was amazed. ”

She liked the adrenaline rush.

It was exciting.

Anlizi was a little different from ye Zao.

She loved to play.

“But when she was playing, she was scared out of her wits. ”

She cried like a ghost.

It was a stark contrast to the calm ye Zao.

They played some exciting games.

The two went to the haunted house again.

There were three floors in the haunted house.

They had to queue up to enter.

“An Lizi was very timid. When she stepped into the haunted house, she was so scared that she grabbed ye Zao’s hand. “Zao Zao! You have to protect me!” ”

“No problem.”

The haunted house was very eerie.

All kinds of props were very realistic.

An Lizi was so scared that she screamed repeatedly.

“She grabbed ye Zao’s arm tightly, wishing that she could turn into an octopus and wrap herself around ye Zao. Throughout the entire process, she did not even dare to open her eyes. ” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Three minutes later.

Ye Zao brought an lizi out of the haunted house.

Only then did she realize.

An Lizi was not the only one who was holding her hand. There were also two young women who she did not know.

Ye Zao’s skin was fair.

It was these three who had pinched her red.

“The two of them said in embarrassment, “I’m sorry, Miss! We didn’t do it on purpose. We were too scared in there just now!” ”

“It’s okay.”Ye Zao smiled slightly.

The two of them looked up at Ye Zao.

They were stunned.

This was too beautiful.

It was too dark in the haunted house just now. They did not see ye Zao’s face clearly. They did not expect ye Zao to be so beautiful!

“Seeing that ye Zao was so bold, the two of them thought that ye Zao was a tomboy. ”

They did not expect the reversal to be so big!

“After coming out of the haunted house, Ye Zao and an Lizi went to play bumper cars again. ”

...

On Li Boyang’s side.

“There was a problem with Li Boyang’s results, and it could only be found today. ”

Li Boyang’s hands trembled as he entered his admission card number and identity card number.

“He saw that all the students around him had obtained high scores, but his results had not been able to be found out. ”

Li Boyang was extremely anxious.

“He tossed and turned every day, unable to sleep all night. ”

“Fortunately, he could finally find out now. ”

The next second.

A result sheet appeared in front of Li Boyang.

688 points!
