“Lin Jincheng, who was sitting at the side, flipped a page of the newspaper in his hand. His expression was a little grave as he looked up at Ye Zao, “Zao Zao, try not to go out at night during this period of time. Even if you have to go out, have Ah Ze or Shaoqing accompany you.””

“What’s going on?”Ye Zao frowned slightly.

“Lin Jincheng continued, “On Zhaoyang Road near the university town, three female university students have gone missing for no reason in the past two days. They haven’t been found yet.””

“Oh my God! When did this happen?”Ye Shu asked in surprise. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Lin Jincheng glanced at the newspaper. “The first female university student went missing three days ago. The last two went missing the day before and yesterday. The youngest is only nineteen years old and has just entered the first year of university this year.”

“Ye Shu herself had children. Hearing such news, she felt a chill run down her spine. “That family must be worried to death! I hope they’re fine, they’re just hanging out together!””

“Lin Jincheng frowned. “It’s not possible to hang out together. The police found the phone of one of the girls nearby. Moreover, these three girls come from different schools, so they don’t know each other at all.””

“Are there no surveillance cameras on the way?”Ye Shu asked.

Lin Jincheng shook his head. “It’s because there are no surveillance cameras that it’s difficult to solve the case!”

Ye Shu sighed. “Three female university students disappeared in three days. This is too terrifying. I hope we can solve the case soon.”

“Lin Jincheng continued, “The police suspect that it’s a gang. They have already set up a special task force to investigate.””

“Ye Langhua and ye Shu had been separated for so many years. She knew what it was like to lose her daughter. When she heard the news, she felt extremely uncomfortable. She turned to look at Ye Zao, “Zao Zao, did you hear what your father said? Don’t go out at night during this period of time! Don’t be afraid of anything, just in case!””

“Ye Zao nodded. “I know, don’t worry.””

“After eating, Ye Zhuozhuo drove to the base.”

“Half an hour later, a handsome Land Rover steadily stood at the entrance of the base. Smoke and dust rose as the car door was opened. A pair of long legs was the first thing that came into view. Looking up from the pair of long legs, one could see one”

“Almost at the same time, Cen Jiang walked out of the base. “Miss Ye.””

“Cen Jiang.”

“”Miss Ye, why are you alone?”Cen Jiang looked behind ye Zao. “Where’s Master Wu?””

“”He went to country Y on a business trip,”ye Zao said as he walked around to the trunk.”

“”OH.”Cen Jiang nodded and followed ye Zao to the trunk. When he saw ye Zao take out two metal suitcases from the trunk, CEN Jiang immediately said, “Miss Ye, put them there. I’ll do it!””

“Although the metal suitcases did not look big, it was not good for a girl like ye Zao to carry things.”

Men!

They should have a gentlemanly demeanor.

Ye Zao raised his eyes slightly. “You might not be able to carry this.”

Can’t carry it?

“As a man, how could he not be able to carry it?”

Could it be that he was worse than a little girl?

How was that possible!

“Cen Jiang rolled up his sleeves, revealing the triceps on his arms. “Miss Ye, you’re underestimating me too much! Although I’m not as powerful as master five, it’s just carrying a suitcase. It’s not a difficult task for me.””

“Ye Zao explained, “There are some precision machines in here. Although they’re small in size, their weight is not light.””

“Cen Jiang smiled and said, “No problem. Just let me do it.””

“You really want to try?”Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly.

“Cen Jiang nodded. “With a man like me around, how can I let you do manual labor!””

Ye Zao put down an iron box.

“Cen Jiang said, “Miss Ye, put both of them down.””

“”You really can’t carry two,”ye Zao said.”

“Cen Jiang looked at Ye Zao. “Miss Ye, you’re underestimating me too much.””

“Hearing that, Ye Zao had no choice but to put the two boxes on the ground.”

Cen Jiang walked over to carry the boxes.

He had thought that he would be able to carry the two boxes easily.

“After all, the boxes didn’t look that big.”

But what he didn’t expect was that the two boxes that didn’t look that big were actually so heavy!

“Cen Jiang’s face was red from holding it in, but the two boxes still didn’t move at all!”

This was too heavy!

Cen Jiang’s strength wasn’t small either. He was able to lift the 100-jin barbell in one go.

“But today, he was actually unable to lift the two metal boxes.”

Not to mention two.

He was afraid that he wouldn’t be able to lift even one.

“But the bull had already been blown. Even if he couldn’t carry it, he had to carry it.”

Ye Zhuo was too amazing!

“Cen Jiang took a deep breath, hoping to break through himself and carry the suitcases.”
