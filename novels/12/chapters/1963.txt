“Xu Yao shook her head. “No, I won’t regret it.” ”

She would never regret it.

“Then let’s leave it at that.”Xu Chaonan sighed. “I still have a meeting in the afternoon. I’ll be leaving first.”

“Since things had already come to this, no matter how much she said, it would be useless. ”

She could see it in Xu Yao’s eyes.

She had to give birth to this child.

“No matter what happened, she would not change her mind. ”

She was still too young.

She did not know the consequences of this matter.

“Xu Yao continued, “Auntie, drive slowly on the road.” ”

Xu Chaonan nodded.

“After returning to the company, the more Xu Chaonan thought about it, the more he felt that something was wrong. ”

“If Xu Yao really loved he ziteng, it would be fine. ”

But she didn’t love he ziteng at all.

“She didn’t even love he ziteng, so how could she be willing to give birth to a child for he ziteng? ”

Could it be...

It was also because of money?

“But if that was the case, then this matter would be huge. ”

It was said that he ziteng got into a car accident on the way to buy milk tea for Xu Yao.

“Coincidentally, after the car accident happened, Xu Yao was found to be pregnant again. ”

Was all of this really so coincidental?

Xu Chaonan pinched the space between his eyebrows.

“Xu Yao, this child, was completely spoiled by her brother and sister-in-law. If she had known earlier, she would have taught him everything back then. ”

Xu Chaonan was very regretful now.

She regretted being busy with her career and neglecting to discipline Xu Yao.

“If not, Xu Yao would definitely not be like this. ”

On the other side.

Mars.

“Ye Zhuo put down the document and yawned. Because he had not slept for two days and two nights in a row, a faint tired expression appeared on his face. ”

One-third of the experiment was about to be completed.

The time for her to go to the state of Changyue was getting closer and closer!

Ye Zhuo’s eyes were curved.

“Because she did not need to personally watch the remaining segment, Ye Zhuo stood up and planned to go to the rest cabin to have a good sleep. After replenishing his energy, he would return to Earth. ”

Ye Zhuo had just walked out of the laboratory when Tang Mi came up to him. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Miss Ye.”

“What’s the matter?”Ye Zhuo looked back.

“Seeing the weariness in ye Zhuo’s eyes, Tang Mi couldn’t bear to talk about he ziteng. She wanted ye Zhuo to have a good sleep. ”

This experiment had been conducted for a total of seven days.

Ye Zhuo hadn’t slept well for seven days.

“Seeing Tang Mi’s hesitant expression, ye zhuo continued, “If you have something to say, just say it. Why Are You Stuttering?” ”

Tang mi still didn’t know how to say it.

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Team leader Tang Mi, stuttering isn’t your style. Hurry up and say it.” ”

“Tang mi raised her head to look at ye Zhuo and continued, “Miss Ye, he gong, something happened to he gong.” ”

He ziteng?

“What happened?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“Tang mi said, “He gong had a very serious car accident and is still in a coma. The doctor diagnosed that he will become a vegetable in the future.” ”

“When did it happen?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“”Seven days ago,”tang mi continued, “That afternoon, the He family’s parents asked assistant Shen to contact you, but you were in the laboratory at that time, so they couldn’t contact you.” ”

Ye Zhuo pressed his temples.

“He ziteng was a young man whom she had high hopes for. Now that he ziteng had such a serious car accident, ye Zhuo naturally couldn’t sit idly by. ”

“”Get Ready. We’ll return to Earth right away.”In just a moment, the fatigue on ye Zao’s face disappeared completely, as if he had never felt tired before. ”

“”Miss Ye, why don’t you take a rest first before you leave?”Tang mi said. ”

“No need.”Ye Zao said concisely.

Tang mi immediately went to prepare to return to Earth.

“When mother he received a call from assistant Xiao Shen, she said excitedly, “Good, good, good! Thank you, assistant Xiao Shen!” ”

“After hanging up, father he asked curiously, “Who’s calling? Why Are You So Happy?” ”

“Mother he said, “It’s assistant Xiao Shen. Assistant Xiao Shen said that Miss ye will be coming to the hospital to see Ziteng soon!” ”

“When father he heard Miss Ye’s words, he immediately stood up from his chair. “Really?” ”

“”It’s true.”Mother he nodded and smiled with tears in her eyes. “We’re saved. This time, our Ziteng is really saved.” ”

Xu Yao stood up as well. “That’s Great!”

“Mi Chen, who was changing he ziteng’s dressing, also smiled and said yes, but she was sneering in her heart. ”

The He family’s parents were too whimsical!

“After all, he ziteng was no different from a good-for-nothing now. ”

“Not to mention Miss Ye, even if there were ten of them, they wouldn’t be able to save he ziteng. ”

He really wanted to see who this miss ye was.
