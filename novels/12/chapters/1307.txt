“After all, the ABA was the International Alliance.”

“However, Xie Wanqiu did not expose ye Zao, she continued, “Yinyin is a core member of the ABA. Soon, they will hold the next assessment competition in Beijing. Zao Zao, if you want to join the ABA, you can ask yinyin to help you introduce them. Yinyin has a good relationship with their executive officer.””

“After saying that, Xie Wanqiu turned to look at Zheng Wanyin. “Oh right, yinyin, is the ABA recruiting university students?””

“Zheng wanyin said, “That depends on their aptitude. A person as outstanding as cousin-in-law will definitely have no problems. Furthermore, cousin-in-law knows Mr. Carl.””

“Xie wanqiu continued, “If you have time, tell your cousin-in-law in front of the executive officer. The ABA is a good place. The two of you can take care of each other when you are together.””

“Okay.”Zheng Wanyin nodded in response.

Wasn’t she just dealing with it?

What kind of place was the ABA?

Could it be that anyone could enter?

One had to know that the cleaners of the ABA were all graduate students.

“If it wasn’t for her special talent, she wouldn’t have been specially recruited.”

Ye Zhuo didn’t even have the qualifications to become a cleaner.

Of course.

These words couldn’t be put on the table.

“After saying that.., zheng wanyin continued, “Right, the day after tomorrow is the day when the ABA and Beijing HI jointly hold the assessment. Mr. Carl came to Beijing because of this matter. If cousin-in-law wants to join the ABA, you can come and give it a try! “I’m not afraid that cousin-in-law will laugh at me if I say it out loud. I also have to go on stage to participate in this assessment the day after tomorrow.””

Xie wanqiu frowned. “Aren’t you a core member? Why are you still taking the assessment?”

“Zheng wanyin explained softly, “This is what a core member needs to take the test for.””

“In other words, if you weren’t a core member, you wouldn’t even be qualified to take the test!”

Xie wanqiu felt very comfortable when she heard this. Her biological granddaughter was just that outstanding!

“Zheng Wanyin looked up at Cen Shaoqing. “Cousin, why don’t you bring cousin-in-law along? I’ll send an electronic ticket to second aunt’s wechat.””

“”I’m not free,”Cen Shaoqing rejected her directly.”

Zheng Wanyin was a little embarrassed.

“Zhou Xiang helped Zheng Wanyin out of her predicament. “Wanyin, your cousin has been too busy recently. Send the admission ticket over. I’ll go with your second cousin.””

“Okay.”Zheng Wanyin nodded.

“In the evening, ye Zao proposed to leave.”

Cen Shaoqing went back from ye Zao.

Xie wanqiu looked at ye Zao’s back with a cold expression.

This ye Zao really didn’t put her in his eyes!

“This was his first time visiting her, and he actually didn’t know how to prepare a gift for his grandmother.”

Something that didn’t respect his elders.

He didn’t know how his family taught him!

“Back in the room, xie wanqiu said angrily, “I really don’t know how Shaoqing took a fancy to that kind of person! She doesn’t have the slightest sense of discernment. She hasn’t even passed through the door yet, and she’s already treating me like this. If she passes through the door in the future, will there still be a place for me to speak in this house? No, I absolutely can’t let her marry Shaoqing!””

“Zheng wanyin said, “Grandma, don’t be angry. Cousin-in-law is still young after all. It’s normal for her to not be so considerate in some matters.””

“You only know how to bend the rules!”Xie Wanqiu was very angry.

“Zheng Wanyin patted Xie Wanqiu’s back, “Grandma, in the end, this is also second aunt’s family matter and has nothing to do with us. Moreover, cousin-in-law is the granddaughter-in-law that Old Lady Cen personally chose. There won’t be any problems with her judgment.””

“What did you say?”Xie wanqiu looked at Zheng Wanyin.

Zheng Wanyin repeated what she just said. “I said cousin-in-law is the granddaughter-in-law that old lady cen personally chose.”

“Ye Zhuo was chosen by that old lady of the Cen Family?”Xie wanqiu asked.

“Yes.”Zheng Wanyin nodded.

“Too much!”Xie wanqiu slammed the table and stood up. “This is too much! The Cen family is simply going too far!”

“”Grandma, what happened to you?”Zheng Wanyin was shocked.”

“Xie wanqiu continued, “This Shaoqing is my grandson after all. Why should I let that old woman from the Cen family make the decision alone? I, the grandmother, didn’t agree to it. What right does Bai Tang have to make the decision on her own!””

Bai Tang.

So Bai Tang was really the name of the Cen family’s old lady.

“Zheng Wanyin narrowed her eyes. “Grandma, don’t be angry. This is the Cen family’s family matter after all.””

“Are you saying that I’m an Outsider?”Xie wanqiu looked at Zheng Wanyin.

“Zheng Wanyin shook her head. “Grandma, you’re misinterpreting what I’m saying. I’m saying that it’s better to avoid unnecessary trouble.””

On the other side.

Ye Zhuo leaned against the back of his chair and narrowed his eyes slightly.

“”Leader, do you want to go to the teahouse nearby?”Cen Shaoqing asked.”
