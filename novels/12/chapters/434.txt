“Chapter 435: 122: Big Burning and domineering entrance, slapping Feng Xianxian in the face! 3”

Translator: 549690339

“What About You?”Little Qin asked.

“”I’ll drive myself to the company.”After saying that, ye Shu said, “Oh right, don’t tell my daughter about this.” ”

Little Qin nodded.

“After Little Qin left, Ye Shu went to the driver’s seat, closed the car door, and drove away. ”

Soon.

The car stopped at the entrance of the company.

But Ye Shu did not get out of the car. She leaned on the steering wheel and cried loudly.

Nineteen years ago.

Lin Qingcheng suddenly disappeared. She had never cried like this.

“Others said that she was a mistress. When her child was a bastard, she had never cried. ”

“But today, seeing the reality with her own eyes, she could not help it. ”

The atmosphere in the car was oppressive and cramped.

“After a long time, ye Shu finally got out of the car. ”

“At this moment, no sadness could be seen on her face. ”

...

On the other side.

Ye Zhuo had just finished sending ye Shu off and turned around to return to his dormitory when he received a call from CEN Shaoqing. “Are you at school?”

“As Ye Zhuo walked, he spoke to him. “I’m here. How about you? Are You in Beijing?” ”

“I’m here too.”Cen Shaoqing caressed the prayer beads. “The military training is a total of 15 days?”

“En...”ye Zhuo thought for a moment. “It seems like it.”

“For the first time, Cen Shaoqing felt that 15 days was so long, he continued, “The instructors hired by Jingcheng University are all proper military officers. They are very strict and do not show any mercy when it comes to training. If you don’t want to participate in the military training, I can inform the school leader.” ”

“There’s no need.”Ye Zhuo’s tone was indifferent. He did not take this matter to heart at all. “It’s just military training. It’s no big deal.”

What was military training?

“In her previous life, she had gone through devil-like training. ”

Ye Zhuo talked to Cen Shaoqing as he walked.

“Today, she was wearing a black T-shirt with a tasseled hem. A slender waist was faintly discernible in the tasseled, and that waist was so thin that not even a single bit of fat could be seen. ”

“Her legs were slender and long. She was clearly wearing long pants, but for no reason, she gave people a sense of temptation. ”

She was wearing a pair of black martin boots.

Her eyebrows were like a painting.

She was extremely cool!

“Walking on the campus, she attracted the attention of many people. ”

“F * ck! F * ck! Is this the new student this year?”

“”She shouldn’t be a new student, right? Other than that Feng Xianxian on the forum, I haven’t heard of any other outstanding new student this year.” ”

“”Although she’s not a student of our school, she’s really beautiful!” ”

“”If she were a freshman, we would definitely beat up that new campus belle with the surname Feng!” ”

“Do you even need to say that?”

“Before Feng Xianxian went to school, she had already started to be active on the Forum of Beijing University. With her extremely high popularity and perfect facial features, she became the new campus belle of Beijing University right after school started. ”

Ye Zhuo walked all the way to the dormitory door. He held his cell phone in one hand and the key in the other. “I’m not going to talk to you anymore. I’m going to the dormitory now.”

“”Okay, remember to sleep for a while in the afternoon.” ”

“Okay.”

Ye Zhuo hung up the phone and opened the dormitory door.

The three roommates who didn’t come earlier were all here.

Two of them were chatting.

One of them was squatting on the ground and tidying up his clothes.

“When they saw ye Zao come in, everyone looked at her, their eyes filled with astonishment. ” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“The short-haired girl squatting on the ground quickly stood up and introduced herself. “Hello, my name is Li Yueyue. I’m from the Beautiful Grassland Hulunbeier. I’m from the Chemistry Department’s Pharmaceutical Chemistry Department.” ”

“After Li Yueyue finished speaking, another sweet-looking girl with two braided hair walked over, “My Name is Bai Xiaoman. I’m from the capital. Xianxian and I are both in the finance department. That’s right, that’s xianxian. She’s also from the capital.” ”

“Speaking up to this point, Bai Xiaoman pulled Feng Xianxian over. “Speaking of which, you might not believe it, but Xianxian is the true heiress of a wealthy family! You should all know about the Lin family, right? Xianxian is the heiress of the Lin Family!” ”

“When Feng Xianxian was sent to the dormitory by a few bodyguards of the Lin family, Bai Xiaoman was so shocked that her jaw almost fell off. ”

“At that moment, Bai Xiaoman felt that Feng Xianxian was a princess! ”

“Although she was also a citizen of the capital and her family had a small company, her conditions were very good. ”

But she could only be considered a second generation of the wealthy.

And Feng Xianxian was a real aristocrat!

“In front of a wealthy aristocrat, a small second generation of the wealthy was nothing? ”

This was the first time Bai Xiaoman came into contact with a real wealthy aristocrat in real life!

“Originally, she thought that when she introduced Feng Xianxian to her other two roommates, they would be as shocked as she was! ”

Unfortunately.

Except for Li Yueyue who was a little surprised.
