“In father Zhao’s opinion, if Zhao Xueyin could not be together with master five in the end, then the lawyer would be the best home for Zhao Xueyin. ”

“After thinking for a long time, father Zhao finally remembered, “Yes! A spare tire! A spare tire! You young people should know what this means.” ”

“Hearing this, Zhao Xueyin’s expression eased up slightly. ”

To be honest.

“With the current status of the Si Lui, he didn’t even have the qualifications to be her spare tire. ”

“Zhao Xueyin turned to look at Father Zhao, “Father, I should have told you before that I will never marry anyone other than master five! Master Five is my life’s Goal! Even if I really can’t marry Master Five in the end, I will still marry Jin Ruyu, the eldest son of the Zhen Fei Financial Group!” ”

Zhenfei Financial Group was ranked third on the list.

“If they could marry Jin Ruyu, they would have half of zhenfei financial group in their hands. When they joined forces, their Zhao family would be one of the few existences in the financial world. ”

“However, Jin Ruyu would settle for the second best. ”

“No matter how good Jin Ruyu was, she could not compare to master five. ”

“Father Zhao looked at Zhao Xueyin. “I think you have a higher heart than the sky! Your life is thinner than paper! It’s already good enough to have ah Lui as your spare tire, but you want Jin Ruyu to be your spare tire! Do you really think you are some kind of celestial being?” ”

Zhao Xueyin took a deep breath and tried hard to control her emotions that were about to explode.

“After a moment, Zhao Xueyin calmed down a little and turned to Father Zhao. “Dad, I can’t guarantee that I’ll be able to marry master five! But, marrying Jin Ruyu is only a matter of whether I want to or Not!” ”

“Father Zhao snorted coldly. Looking at Zhao Xueyin like this, he thought of himself when he was young. ”

“At that time, he was as confident as Zhao Xueyin. ”

“This child’s nature was like this, so it couldn’t be blamed on her! ”

“Father Zhao continued, “Did you gain anything from your trip to the capital? Ye Langhua has sent word that ye Zao will be sent over the day after tomorrow.” ”

“The day after tomorrow? So Soon?”Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes.

“Father Zhao immediately asked, “Did you fight with Ye Zao This Time?” ”

Zhao Xueyin nodded.

“How was it?”Father Zhao was a little worried.

He was worried that ye Zao was too outstanding and would steal Zhao Xueyin’s limelight.

People were all contrasting with each other.

Just like how green leaves complemented red flowers.

“If ye Zao was a green leaf, then it was fine. ”

“If ye Zao was a red flower, then it would be troublesome. ”

“Currently, Zhao Xueyin was the most outstanding existence in Shunxi Financial Group. If ye Zao was more outstanding than Zhao Xueyin, then how would the Zhao family stand out? ”

How would they be promoted to an aristocratic family?

“Thinking of this, Father Zhao frowned deeply. ”

“Before the aircraft carrier incident, Zhao Xueyin was still very afraid of Ye Zao. After all, Ye Zao had an outstanding performance in the scientific and technological world. ” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“After the aircraft carrier incident, ye Zao could only be a stepping stone for Zhao Xueyin. ”

“Even if ye Zao was a stepping stone for her, she felt that ye Zao was a sore spot! ”

“Zhao Xueyin continued, “After all, Ye Zao is ye Langhua’s biological granddaughter. She’s still a little smart, but she can’t make it to the public. You Don’t have to worry.” ”

“Father Zhao frowned. “If she’s just a little smart, can she make a name for herself in the science and Technology World and become a phd?” ”

“”According to my understanding, the reason ye Zao was able to win first place in last year’s science and Technology Competition and obtain a phd was purely because she picked up a few loopholes.”Speaking up to this point, Zhao Xueyin paused for a moment, then, she asked, “Dad, do you know about the aircraft carrier project that has been hyped up recently?” ”

Father Zhao shook his head.

He was only interested in financial news. He had always been clueless about other things.

“Zhao Xueyin continued, “Ye Zao just released a press conference yesterday. He said that he will develop the world’s first aircraft carrier that can land on the eight planets within two years!” ”

“Hearing this, Father Zhao was stunned. It took him a long time to react. “So, she can really develop an aircraft carrier?” ”

“Zhao Xueyin laughed lightly, “Dad! Do you think an aircraft carrier is a toy? ! You can develop an aircraft carrier just because you say you can! Even C Nation did not develop an aircraft carrier. How Old is Ye Zhuo? Most importantly, she has the aircraft carrier project in her hands to complete. She even has to come to the consortium. Do you think she really has that much time and energy to multitask?” ”

You Can’t have it both ways.

Who Did ye Zao think she was?

Was she a God?

“Hearing this, father Zhao immediately heaved a sigh of relief. ”

“He was Zhao Xueyin’s biological father, and he understood Zhao Xueyin. ”

“Zhao Xueyin had never been a person who underestimated her enemy. Since Zhao Xueyin had said so, then ye Zao definitely did not have any real talent. ”

“Father Zhao raised his head to look at Zhao Xueyin, then he said, “Although ye Zao is not a threat to you, you can not underestimate your enemy. No matter what, she is still a descendant of the Ye family! There is still that old thing Zhang Yifeng behind her! The day after tomorrow will come. You should make a good plan yourself.” ”
