Cen Yuyan carefully looked at herself in the mirror.

“Under the thick makeup, the more Cen Yuyan looked, the more beautiful she felt. “Sure, I’m very satisfied. You can go find my assistant to settle the bill. Oh right, you can also take this set of makeup on the table with you.” ”

“The set of makeup on the table belonged to the luxury series and was only opened. Adding up the total price, it was around six figures. Cen Yuyan had always wanted to use the best things for her face. ”

“Hearing this, the makeup artist said in disbelief, “Miss Cen, you don’t want these anymore?” ”

“En.”Cen Yuyan nodded. “I’ll give them to you.”

“”Thank you, Miss Cen.”The makeup artist hurriedly bowed to thank her. ”

She sighed in her heart. Those flattery just now were not wrong.

“After the makeup artist left, Cen Yuyan opened the wardrobe and chose a familiar dress to change into. ”

“Just as she changed into the dress, footsteps came from outside the door. “Yuyan.” ”

Cen Yuyan curled her lips slightly and opened the door. “You’re here.”

“Zhou Rui leaned against the door frame and looked at Cen Yuyan. “My Young Miss, are you ready?” ”

Cen Yuyan held up her skirt and twirled in front of Zhou Rui. “Is it Nice?”

“It’s very nice. It’s said that a heavenly immortal has descended to the mortal world.”

Cen Yuyan was so coaxed by Zhou Rui that she couldn’t close her mouth.

“”Then, this heavenly immortal, can we set off now?”Zhou Rui continued to ask. ”

“Yes.”

“Then let’s go.”Zhou Rui held Cen Yuyan’s hand.

The two of them walked out of the door together.

“At this moment, CEN Yuyan seemed to suddenly remember something and suddenly stopped walking. “Wait a moment.” ”

“What’s Wrong?”Zhou Rui turned around to look at her.

“I’m going into the house to get something.”Cen Yuyan walked into the house.

“Not long after, Cen Yuyan walked out of the house with two beautiful gift boxes. ”

“Zhou Rui’s eyes flashed as he asked, “What’s inside?” ”

“CEN Yuyan said, “It’s a gift for uncle and aunt. I almost forgot about it.” ”

“Zhou Rui said, “If you want to prepare a gift, it should be my parents preparing a gift for you. What kind of gift would a prospective daughter-in-law like you prepare for them? For such a good girl like you to be willing to be with their son, the old couple would be more than happy!” ”

“Cen Yuyan smiled and said, “I’m still a junior after all. Preparing a gift is a gesture and a courtesy.” ”

“I can’t win against you.”Zhou Rui put his arm around Cen Yuyan’s shoulder. “Let’s go quickly.”

“Okay.”Cen Yuyan nodded.

Zhou Rui’s car stopped outside the villa’s door. The two of them got into the car together.

“Not long after, they arrived at the Zhou family home. ”

The Zhou family’s parents were dressed very ceremoniously today.

“After all, Zhou Rui’s girlfriend was not an ordinary person. ”

She was the Cen family’s fourth young miss.

“The more mother Zhou thought about it, the more agitated she became. Her hands were trembling. ”

“Father Zhou pressed down on mother Zhou’s hand. “Look at you. You look like you’ve never seen the market before. So what if she’s the Cen family’s fourth young miss? In the end, she’s still trying to please us!” ”

“In the end, their son was still very capable. ”

“Although his studies were not good and he did not even pass the university entrance exam, he was much better than those who passed the entrance exam to a prestigious university. ”

How could those who got into a prestigious university make Cen Yuyan fall for them?

“Hearing Father Zhou’s words, mother Zhou calmed down a little and said with a smile, “You’re right. So what if she’s the fourth daughter of the Cen Family? If she marries into our Zhou family, then she’s a member of our Zhou family!” ” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“At this moment, the sound of a car engine could be heard outside the door. ”

“Mother Zhou originally wanted to go out to welcome them, but Father Zhou stopped her. “Now is not the time. Don’t forget Rui Rui’s instructions. We have to put on a good front.” ”

Mother Zhou immediately sounded Zhou Rui’s instructions

“A moment later, the doorbell rang. ”

The nanny walked over to open the door.

Zhou Rui walked in with Cen Yuyan.

“Cen Yuyan was the Cen family’s fourth miss after all. Whether it was her appearance or temperament, she was incomparable to ordinary people. The Zhou family’s parents looked at Cen Yuyan and felt a little cold. They couldn’t help but sigh in their hearts at Zhou Rui’s ability. ”

“”Yuyan, these are my parents.”Zhou Rui introduced the Zhou family’s parents to Cen Yuyan. ”

“Cen Yuyan hurriedly greeted, “Hello, uncle and aunt.” ”

“Zhou rui immediately followed up, “Father and mother, this is my girlfriend, your future daughter-in-law, Cen Yuyan.” ”

“Mother Zhou was the first to react. She smiled and said, “This is Yuyan! I’ve heard Rui Rui mention you a long time ago. Quickly sit, quickly sit. Just treat this place as your own home. Don’t stand on ceremony.” ”

“”Thank you, Auntie.”CEN Yuyan continued, “By the way, Auntie, this is a gift I prepared for you and uncle. It’s a small token of appreciation. I hope you and uncle won’t mind.” ”
