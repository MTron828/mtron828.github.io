Ye Zao wanted to leave him?

No Way!

“If it wasn’t for him, would ye Zao exist in this world? ”

“If he didn’t spare ye Zao’s life back then and directly killed ye Zao, would ye Zao exist in this world? ”

Ye Zao was able to become the famous Miss Ye of Chang Yue Country and now the First Lady of the General Alliance country because of him.

Because he gave life to ye Zhuo!

He was ye Zhuo’s father! Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Speaking up to this point, man Xing paused, then he said, “Dad, why don’t We Forget It? It’s not easy for elder sister to do so much. Moreover, we have let elder sister down, so let’s not disturb her life. As long as we know that elder sister is living well.” ”

“”Xing ‘er, don’t interfere in this matter.”Man Jiangshan continued, “Just leave it to me and your mother.” ”

Man Xing was still a child.

She did not know the benefits involved at all.

“Moreover, Ye Zhuo was the daughter that he and Zhao Dan had been searching for for so many years. ”

“As a parent, wasn’t it normal for them to recognize their own child? ”

“”Dad!”Man Xing sighed, “I really feel sorry for my eldest sister. It has been so many years, and it hasn’t been easy for her. When I was young, I was the Apple of your and mom’s eyes at home, but she had to live a vagrant life without a meal. Not to mention her, if it were me, I would also be very angry and try my best to disown us! “Please understand my eldest sister!” ”

The anger in man Jiangshan’s heart was very well stirred by the words ‘disown relationship’.

“”She wants to compete with you? How can she compete with you!”Man Jiangshan looked at man Xing, “You were born to be the Lucky Star of man Xing nation. I don’t know how much auspicious aura you brought! The entire city has become rich because of you! What about her? What has she done? She deserves all the suffering she has suffered!” ”

“The moment ye Zhuo was born, he had caused the people of Manxing kingdom to be in deep trouble. If it were not for this, he and Zhao Dan would not have chosen to throw ye Zhuo away. ”

“To throw away their own child with their own hands, as parents, were their hearts really not hurting? ”

They were more heartbroken than anyone else!

“Moreover, this kind of sadness could not be shared with outsiders. They could only hide it in their hearts. ”

Especially Zhao Dan.

“As a mother, she often watched the videos of ye Zao’s wandering suffering and cried bitterly ”

But these were all things that ye Zao had to experience.

“Born as a human, only after experiencing pain and suffering could one see an incomparably brilliant rainbow after a storm. ”

“”Now, not only can she not blame me, she even has to thank me! If it wasn’t for the wandering days that tempered her mind, would she be able to achieve what she has today? Would she be able to stand shoulder to shoulder with young master Dongli?” ”

“At this moment, man Jiangshan could not wait to announce to everyone that ye Zhuo was his and Zhao Dan’s daughter! ”

“Hearing this, man Xing sighed, he then said, “Although that’s what you said, elder sister might not necessarily think so. “Although elder sister is older than me, she is still a child after all. She doesn’t have a comprehensive view when considering things. Although your actions towards her back then tempered her mind, all she saw was abandonment. If she really did not hate us, she would not have tried so hard to disown us. Dad, forget it, just let elder sister go... ... .. ”

“”Let Her Go?”Man Jiangshan looked at man Xing. “Xing ‘er, you have to figure out who is the one who won’t let anyone Go! Even a three-year-old child knows that she has to repay her parents for raising her. Does she know?” ”

Man Jiangshan’s angry roar immediately attracted the attention of others.

“Man Xing held man Jiangshan’s arm and said without batting an eyelid, “Dad, you drank too much. Let’s talk when we get back.” ”

“As they spoke, he helped man Jiangshan onto the aircraft. ”

“Soon, the aircraft arrived at man Xing country. ”

“Zhao Dan saw that man Jiangshan’s expression was not very good. He looked at man Xing and asked with some doubt, “Who made your dad angry?” ”

“MAN XING said, “Mom, I have news for you. Don’t be shocked.” ”

“”Go Ahead,”Zhao Dan said. ”

“MAN XING continued, “We saw elder sister at the family identification banquet.” ”

“Ye Zhuo?”Zhao Dan asked.

“”Yes.”Man Xing nodded. “Mom, my previous guess was right. Young Master Dongli’s girlfriend is elder sister.” ”

“Hearing this, Zhao Dan asked incredulously, “You mean, that Earthling?” ”

“Yes.”

“After hearing this news, Zhao Dan found it difficult to digest it for a while. ”

She really didn’t understand how that Earthling could be ye Zhuo!
