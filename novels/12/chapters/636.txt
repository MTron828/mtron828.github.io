Doctor.

Piperazine was a prescription drug.

“Without a doctor’s prescription, it was very difficult for ordinary people to buy it.”

“If Xu Lanyue and Xu Lanying were related, then all of this could be explained.”

Ye Zhuo turned on the computer and entered Xu Lanyue’s name into the database.

“Although there were more than 30,000 people in the country named Xu Lanyue, there was only one obstetrician named Xu Lanyue in Yunjing City.”

Xu Lanyue was 63 years old this year.

She had been retired for eight years.

She currently lived in Yunjing.

Xu Lanyue was born in an ordinary working family. She had a younger sister and an older brother.

“Her older brother, Xu Guoqiang, had passed away three years ago.”

“Her younger sister, Xu Lanying, had passed away 40 years ago.”

Xu Lanying.

“Seeing this name, Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly.”

So they really were a family.

“If Gu Dening’s side had detected a problem with the health-preserving soup, then this health-preserving soup must have been provided to the mother and daughter by Xu Lanyue.”

19 years.

Feng Qianhua and Hua Wei were able to marry into the Lin family and had planned for 19 years. This chess game was really big.

It was unknown how old Lady Lin would react when she found out the truth about Feng Qianhua and her daughter.

Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly and turned to look at little white. “I want to eat a watermelon.”

“”Okay, I’ll go straight to the kitchen to get it.””

Little White took the elevator downstairs.

“When the servants at home saw little white coming downstairs, they had to tease it a little.”

Little White always made people laugh.

“I’m not talking to you anymore! I’m going to give the beautiful big burning a watermelon!”

Little White brought the watermelon up. Ye Zhuo held the watermelon in one hand and quickly jumped on the keyboard with the other.

“In the blink of an eye, the next day arrived.”

Jiang Su ran would be visiting the Lin family today.

“Therefore, Old Lady Lin left Lin Qingxuan at home with the excuse of a headache.”

“Lin Qingxuan had been staying abroad and had not been able to be filial to Old Lady Lin, so she felt a little guilty. Now that she heard that her mother’s headache was uncomfortable, she felt even more guilty and busied herself, “Mom, why don’t we invite Doctor Qiao over to take a look at you?””

Old Lady Lin was already in her seventies and eighties this year.

“No one knew which came first, tomorrow or the accident.”

“Old Lady Lin shook her head weakly. “It’s fine. With You by my side, I’ll be fine in a while.””

Lin Qingxuan sat by the bed and held Old Lady Lin’s hand.

“At this moment, footsteps came from outside the house. Old Lady Lin immediately signaled to Auntie Zhang.”

Auntie Zhang walked towards the main hall.

“As expected, Feng Qianhua had brought Jiang Sulan here.”

“Auntie Zhang smiled and said, “Miss Qianhua, second Miss Jiang, you’re here. The old lady is in the house. Come in with me quickly.””

Feng Qianhua nodded and turned to look at Jiang Su ran. “Let’s go in.”

The two of them followed Aunt Zhang’s footsteps.

“Aunt Zhang smiled and said, “Old Lady, Miss Qianhua has brought second Miss Jiang to see you.””

Old Lady Lin immediately got up from the bed and smiled. “Let them in quickly.”

Lin Qingxuan was stunned. Why did Old Lady Lin suddenly recover so quickly?

Did Her head not hurt anymore?

Feng Qianhua and Jiang Sulan walked in from outside. “Aunt Lin.”

“Jiang Sulan also called for someone. “Old Madam, I heard that you weren’t feeling well, so Qianhua and I came over to see you. Are You Alright?”Although Jiang Sulan was talking to old Madam Lin.., her gaze was inadvertently sizing up Lin Qingxuan beside her.”

Although Lin Qingxuan was already over forty years old...

“He was still handsome and elegant. In an instant, Jiang Su Ran’s heart was beating a little fast.”

“Old Lady Lin smiled and shook her head. “It’s fine, it’s fine! It’s normal for people to be like this when they’re old! It’s hard for you to come all the way here.””

“After saying this, Old Lady Lin turned to look at Lin Qingxuan. “Qingxuan, let me introduce you. This is the second son of the Jiang family, Jiang Su ran. Su ran, this is our fourth son, Qingxuan.””

“Hearing that, Lin Qingxuan frowned without a trace.”

He thought that old Mrs. Lin was really uncomfortable.

He didn’t expect that old Mrs. Lin was putting on an act with him and was secretly setting him up on a blind date.

“”Hello, Mr. Lin Si.”Jiang Su ran walked up to Lin Qingxuan and stretched out her right hand. “I’m Jiang Su ran.””

Jiang Su ran was very confident in herself.

“She had never been married and was still a virgin. Lin Qingxuan was a man who had been cheated in his second marriage, so there was no reason for him to look down on her.”

Jiang su ran had seen Zhao shuning before.

She believed that her looks were no worse than Zhao Shuning’s.

“In fact, she was even better than Zhao shuning.”

“Hello.”Lin Qingxuan reached out and held Jiang Su ran’s hand.

“Jiang su ran continued, “I heard that Mr. Lin Si had been living in country M before?””

“Yes.”Lin Qingxuan nodded slightly.

“Jiang su ran smiled and said, “I also lived in country M for a period of time. It’s a very beautiful country. The quality of the citizens is generally very high. There’s really no way to compare to it in China.””
