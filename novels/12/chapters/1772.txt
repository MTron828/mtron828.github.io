“”Yes, miss. .”Yuan Yi nodded and stood in place, waiting for Qiu Di. ”

Qiu Di came to the changing room in the office and changed his clothes before walking out.

“Miss. .”Yuan Yi immediately stood up when she saw Qiu di come out.

“Let’s go.”Qiu di glanced at Yuan Yi.

Yuan Yi immediately followed Qiu Di’s footsteps.

“Seeing autumn flute come out, Wu Han took a step forward. “Eldest miss.” ”

“Autumn flute said, “Let’s go to my father’s place.” ”

“”Okay.”Wu Han immediately activated the aircraft. “Eldest miss, please.” ”

“In front of autumn flute, Wu Han did not have a specific position. His origin was mysterious. A few months ago, he suddenly came to autumn flute’s side. After that, if autumn flute lacked a pilot, Wu Han would be the pilot. ”

“If autumn flute lacked a bodyguard, Wu Han would be the bodyguard. If autumn flute lacked a tactician, Wu Han would be the tactician. ”

“In front of autumn flute, Wu Han was omnipotent. ”

“And Wu Han was even more loyal to autumn flute. Other than autumn flute, no one else could order Wu Han. ”

Even autumn town could not order Wu Han.

Autumn flute entered the aircraft.

“Soon, the two aircraft disappeared into the air. ”

“Ten minutes later, the aircraft stopped at the entrance of the headquarters. ”

Wu Han got off the aircraft in advance and walked down with Qiu Di.

“Qiu di said, “Wait outside. I’ll go in alone to find father.” ”

“Yes.”Wu Han nodded.

Qiu Di walked into the headquarters. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

The office door of autumn town was not closed. Qiu Di reached out and knocked on the door. “Father!”

“Come in.”Qiu Chang Zhen turned around.

“Qiu Di walked into the office. “Father, is there something you need me for?” ”

Qiu Chang Zhen pressed the button. “Look at who this person looks like.”

Qiu Di raised his head.

A transparent screen appeared in the air. On the screen was a person’s information.

Ye Zhuo.

Female.

From... Earth?

“Qiu di frowned slightly and looked at Qiu Chang Zhen. “Father, why are you showing me the information of a low-level human?” ”

The people of Earth were low-level humans.

“Planet E-TY889 was located outside the Milky Way. The technology here was advanced, and the space civilization had already reached level 5. ”

As for Earth?

“Earth was still at level 2, what could a level 2 civilization do? ”

“Facing a level 5 civilization, they only needed to move their little finger to crush the entire earth. ”

Most importantly...

“The natives of Earth were all eliminated. Compared to them, the difference was not small. ”

“10,000 years ago, there was a higher level civilization on Earth. As the level of civilization increased, the resources on Earth could no longer satisfy the natives. Therefore, the natives decided to move to a higher level planet than Earth. However, there were too many people on Earth.., they could not move the entire human race, so a system of survival of the fittest had broken out on earth, eliminating a group of people with low qualifications. ”

The descendants of these people with low qualifications would be trapped in the resource-exhausted earth for generations until they were completely wiped out!

“Therefore, at present, all life on Earth was the lowest level existence! ”

“At this moment, Qiu Changzhen asked Qiu Di to look at the information of a low-level human, which only made Qiu di feel disgusted. ”

It was very disgusting.

This behavior was no different from insulting her eyes.

Qiu Di resisted the urge to vomit.

“Qiu Changzhen continued, “Don’t you think this low-level human looks like a person?” ”

Like a person?

Like Who?

“Qiu Di narrowed her eyes, resisted the disgust in her heart, and looked at the low-level human in the information again. ”

It had to be said.

This low-level human did indeed have some color.

It was a pity.

A low-level human was a low-level human.

“Even if he was good-looking, he could only be a low-level human. ”

“At this moment, Qiu di suddenly thought of a person. ”

Ye Zhuo.

“Yes, it was ye Zhuo. ”

“The more he looked, the more it looked like. ”

It was also at this moment that Qiu di suddenly realized that these two people’s names were the same.

They were both called ye Zao.

Was this a coincidence?

But Ye Zao was clearly already dead!

She had personally witnessed ye Zao’s body being sent to the nitrogen chamber of the research bureau to be preserved.

No.

This was not ye Zao.

Ye Zao had died a long time ago.

This was just a low-level human.

“Thinking of this, Qiu di slowly calmed down, she continued, “Father, the unrestrained reproduction on Earth has resulted in an excessive population. Isn’t it normal for there to occasionally be someone who looks 70-80% similar?”There were a total of 7 billion people on Earth, it was normal for there to be a few people who looked similar, let alone the occasional one! ”

“Therefore, this lowly person was definitely not ye Zao. ”

He just happened to have the same name as ye Zao and looked a little like ye Zao.
