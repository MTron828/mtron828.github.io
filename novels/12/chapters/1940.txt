“CEN yueying said, “That’s right, that’s right. We’re all family!” ”

“”Oh right, searing, this is a scarf that I knitted myself when I was bored at home. Try It on and see if you like it. If you like it, I’ll give it to you!”Cen Yuying said as she took out the scarf and handed it to Cen Shaoqing, “Try it on searing.” ”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing took the scarf and bent down to wrap it around ye Zao.

“Black was originally a very dull color, but when it was wrapped around her body, it looked very nice. Her skin was originally white, and now it was as delicate as jade. ”

“Does it look good?”Ye Zao looked up at Cen Shaoqing.

“Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Yes, it suits you very well.” ”

“Ye Zao turned his eyes to Cen Yuying and said with a smile, “Then thank you, Big Sister.” ”

“Cen Yuying walked over and helped ye Zao Tidy up his scarf. She said with a smile, “Your second sister just said that you don’t need to be polite with us. Now You’re being polite with me again!” ”

“Not long after, the three little guys came over and wanted to give ye Zao gifts. ”

Ye Zao slightly bent down and accepted the gifts from the little guys. He took out the gifts that he had prepared for the little guys.

“This is the world’s smartest robot that Tian Tian wants. This is Wang Zi’s air-conditioned clothes. This is the laser toy gun that William Wants. And this...”

“The three little ones were overjoyed and thanked her politely. “Thank you, future aunt!” ”

“On the first day of the New Year, there were more than just a few older sisters in the Cen family. There were also Old Madam Cen’s older sisters and the family that was on good terms with the CEN family. ”

“”Elder sister, is that person in the Red Coat your future granddaughter-in-law?”Old Lady Wang asked. ”

“Old Lady Cen nodded and said, “Yes, yes, yes, the one who is wearing the wine-red coat and standing next to Shaoqing!” ”

“Hearing this, Old Lady Wang smiled and said, “Your granddaughter-in-law is really beautiful! It’s just like the one in the painting!” ”

“Old Lady Cen raised her chin proudly, “Of course, how can my granddaughter-in-law not be good-looking? “Let me tell you, not only is my granddaughter-in-law good-looking, she is also very filial. Look at the air-conditioned clothes I am wearing, and the jewelry I am wearing, especially the emperor green bracelet. They are all gifts from my granddaughter-in-law!” ”

“Old Lady Wang said with a face full of envy, “Your granddaughter-in-law is really good. She is not like the few in my family who only know how to give me money all day long! I already said that I have enough money to spend, but they insisted on giving it to me! Do you think I, an old man, need so much money for what? It’s not like I don’t have money myself!” ”

“The housekeeper at the side said, “It’s all Versailles this round!”! ”

“Soon, it was time to eat. ”

“After eating, Ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing came to the tea room on the third floor. ”

“Seeing the tea set on the coffee table, ye Zhuo could not help but itch. He continued, “Let me make you a cup of tea.” ”

“”If you want to drink tea, I’ll make it for you,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“No need. I want to make it myself.”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Then I’ll play music for you.”

“Play music?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows.

Cen Shaoqing smiled slightly and pointed to the wall. “Look over there.”

Ye Zhuo turned his eyes and saw a phoenix-tailed guqin on the mahogany shelf.

“You know how to play this?”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

Ye Zao smiled. “I really didn’t expect this.”

“CEN Shaoqing said, “There are many things that you didn’t expect.” ”

“After a while, cen shaoqing walked to the zither and sat down cross-legged. He tested the tone and then said, “What do you want to hear?” ”

“”You can improvise,”ye Zao said. ”

“”Okay.”Cen Shaoqing placed his fingers on the zither string. Before long, pleasant music flowed out from between his fingers. ”

Ding Ding Dong Dong.

Three days of circling the beam.

“Ye Zao sat on the short table and brewed tea. His slender and fair hands constantly shuttled between the green tea sets. Smoke rose in spirals, making his peerlessly beautiful face faintly visible. ”

It was especially mysterious.

“In front of him was the beautiful scenery of the human world, and his ears were filled with the music of Immortals. Life was like this, what more could one ask for. ”

The beautiful music of the zither reached downstairs through the window.

Cen Yuying looked up in surprise. “The sound of the zither came from the tea room on the third floor?”

“Old Granny Cen nodded. “From the sound, it should be played by the fifth girl.” ”

“”Grandma, you still dare to call Shaoqing the fifth girl?”Cen Yuya asked with a smile. ”

Cen Shaoqing had a strange temper. Even his family members would not give him face!

The nickname ‘Fifth Girl’was only used when he was young.

“Ever since he grew up, the Cen family rarely called him by this nickname. ”

It was not that they did not call him by it.

They were afraid that Cen Shaoqing would be angry.

“Old madam CEN said, “With my granddaughter-in-law around, why wouldn’t I Dare?” ”

“Cen Yueya smiled and said, “Speaking of which, I haven’t heard our fifth girl play the zither for more than ten years.” ”UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m
