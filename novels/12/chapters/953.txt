“Since things had come to this point, Zhou Xiang could only accept reality. ”

“Zhou Rui hurriedly took the household register and bowed to Zhou Xiang. “Thank you, Mom. Thank you for helping us.” ”

“Zhou Xiang looked at Cen Yuyan. “Live a good life with him. From now on, we won’t have any relationship between mother and daughter.” ”

“After saying this, Zhou Xiang and old Mrs. Cen got into the car. ”

“Seeing the extended version of Lincoln disappear from his sight, Zhou Rui was stunned. He quickly opened his household register and realized that Cen Yuyan’s household register had been moved out. ”

Zhou Rui’s forehead was covered in cold sweat.

How could this be?

How could this be?

“Even in his dreams, he never thought that old Mrs. Cen would be so ruthless. ”

Cen Yuyan was the only daughter of the Cen family who was not married. were they not afraid that the Cen family would have no heir?

“Now that Cen Yuyan was chased out by the Cen family, what was he then? ”

What was the point of him working so hard to make Cen Yuyan pregnant with his child?

“Different from Zhou Rui, Cen Yuyan only felt that she was finally free. She smiled and hugged Zhou Rui. “Zhou Rui, that’s great! We’ve finally waited until today!” ”

“However, Zhou Rui did not respond at all. ”

“Cen Yuyan asked in puzzlement, “Zhou Rui, what’s wrong?” ”

“Zhou Rui tried his best to calm himself down. The corners of his mouth curled up into a smile. “I, I’m just too happy!” ”

“”OH.”CEN Yuyan continued, “Now that we’ve obtained the household registration, shall we go and get the certificate?” ”

“Now?”Zhou Rui asked.

“Cen Yuyan nodded. “That’s right, now!” ”

“If this had happened an hour ago, Zhou Rui would definitely be very happy. ”

But now... Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Cen Yuyan had already been chased out by the CEN family.

“Zhou Rui found an excuse. “Today is not a good day. Why don’t we choose another auspicious day? After all, this is a major event in our lives. I don’t want to be so hasty. This is too unfair to you.” ”

He could not fall out with Cen Yuyan for the time being.

What if the Cen family was just testing him?

“In order to become the Cen family’s son-in-law, Zhou Rui had spent so much time with Cen Yuyan. If Zhou Rui really gave up like this, Zhou Rui would not be willing. ”

“After all, the plan was already half-completed. ”

“Cen Yuyan smiled and said, “Alright, then I’ll listen to you. Let’s go back now.”Cen Yuyan had a smile on her face, but she did not feel good in her heart. Originally, they had agreed at home that they would go to collect the marriage certificate today.., but now, Zhou Rui suddenly changed his mind. ”

Could it be...

Zhou Rui didn’t want to collect the marriage certificate with her?

“At this moment, Cen Yuyan suddenly doubted her choice. ”

She was so determined to sever her relationship with the Cen family.

But now...

Cen Yuyan narrowed her eyes. She hoped that she was thinking too much.

She believed that Zhou Rui wasn’t that kind of person.

“Cen Yuyan looked at Zhou Rui and continued, “Then tell me, when do you think it’s appropriate for us to go and get our marriage certificate?” ”

“Zhou Rui said perfunctorily, “I’ll go and look through the calendar.”. ”

“Okay.”Cen Yuyan nodded.

Zhou Rui drove back.

The first thing he did after returning was to find an opportunity to call song Chenyu.

“When he heard this, song Chenyu frowned tightly. ”

The Cen family’s reaction was beyond her expectations.

She did not think that old madam Cen would really be able to sever ties with Cen Yuyan.

“”Wait a moment, maybe the CEN family is testing you.” ”

“Zhou rui continued, “But the CEN family has already moved Cen Yuyan’s household registration out.” ”

“Song Chenyu said, “Since they can move out, then they can move back!”! “There’s no use in being impatient. No matter what, Cen Yuyan is the Cen family’s fourth young miss. She broke her bones and connected her meridians. The CEN family should be testing you just for show. They won’t really sever ties with her.” ”

“At this point, song chenyu paused and asked, “Have you and Cen Yuyan gone to collect the marriage certificate?” ”

“”Not yet,”Zhou Rui answered. ”

“”Not Yet?”Song Chenyu asked, “Why didn’t you go to collect the marriage certificate today?” ”

Zhou Rui lowered his voice. “Cen Yuyan was chased out by the CEN family. Why should I still collect the marriage certificate from her?”

“Idiot!”Song Chenyu berated. “The Cen family’s severing their relationship with Cen Yuyan was just for show. You found an excuse to refuse to collect the marriage certificate with Cen Yuyan. Didn’t you fall into the Cen family’s trap?”

“Zhou Rui narrowed his eyes. It sounded like that was indeed the case. Perhaps after he and Cen Yuyan got married, the Cen family would move Cen Yuyan’s household registration back! ”

“Then I’ll go and get married to Cen Yuyan Tomorrow?”

“Nonsense!”

“After hanging up, Zhou Rui went into the room. “Yuyan, I want to discuss something with you.” ”
