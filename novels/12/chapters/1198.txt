“Chapter 1199: 257: trash, Zhao Xueyin was thrown out! The rightful heir of the consortium! 1”

Translator: 549690339

Seeing this scene.

Zhao Xueyin was stunned.

Master Five?

Who Did Li Chaoyang Call Master Five?

Cen Shaoqing?

Could it be that Cen Shaoqing is the master five of DK Consortium?

How could it be!

How could CEN Shaoqing be master five!

I heard wrong.

She must have heard wrong.

The founder of DK Financial Group was surnamed Bai.

Cen Shaoqing was surnamed Cen.

How could he be Master Five? !

“At that time, Zhao Xueyin also suspected that these two people were the same person, and she even went to investigate the information. ”

The information showed that Cen Shaoqing had nothing to do with master five.

So.

She must have heard it wrong.

“Zhao Xueyin almost lost her balance, and her face did not have any color. She tried hard to calm herself down. ” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“”Special Assistant Li, don’t joke around! How can he be Master Five!” ”

Cen Shaoqing reached out and took the document from Li Zhaoyang. His thin lips parted slightly. “Throw it out.”

“It was a very simple word, but it had an inexplicable sense of deterrence. ”

He did not mention his name.

“But Li Zhaoyang immediately understood. He bent down and said, “Yes, Master Five.” ”

Master Five.

This time.

Zhao Xueyin heard it clearly.

Could it be that Cen Shaoqing was really master five?

She realized this problem.

Boom!

Zhao Xueyin felt as if she was struck by lightning.

Master Five?

Cen Shaoqing was master five?

“If Cen Shaoqing was master five, then what was she? ”

What did she do in front of Master Five just now?

She called Master Five a cat and dog?

What should she do?

What should she do now?

“Thinking about what she had done just now, Zhao Xueyin was filled with regret. ”

“Before Zhao Xueyin could react, two security guards walked over and lifted Zhao Xueyin up from both sides. ”

Zhao Xueyin could not muster any strength.

“Before Zhao Xueyin could react, she was thrown out of the shopping mall by two security guards. ”

It was the end of the year.

Many socialites were gathered outside the mall to buy jewelry.

“DK Jewelry Center was a large mall, but it was the first time someone was thrown out of the mall. ”

“Who is that? Why is she thrown out?”

“It looks like it’s Zhao Xueyin.”

“Zhao Xueyin? No Way! You must have seen wrongly!”

“”If that’s not Zhao Xueyin, then who is it?” ”

“How did Zhao Xueyin get thrown out?”

“”She must have done something shameful! Why didn’t she look at this place? Isn’t there a saying that goes, ‘Heaven will punish those who are arrogant!'” ”

The crowd discussed animatedly and even took out their phones to take a video.

When had Zhao Xueyin ever been criticized like this?

Her lowered eyes were full of humiliation.

“In a moment, Zhao Xueyin stood up from the ground and ran forward quickly. ”

“As she ran all the way to the car, Zhao Xueyin immediately called Li Chaoyang. ”

She had to ask him clearly.

How did Cen Shaoqing suddenly become master five?

All of this must be a misunderstanding.

“”Sorry, the number you have dialed is an empty number...” ”

The sound of an empty number came from the other end of the phone.

Empty?

How could it be an empty number?

Zhao Xueyin panicked and dialed again.

The notification was still empty.

“Zhao Xueyin opened wechat again, and Li Chaoyang’s wechat also disappeared. ”

It was as if Li Chaoyang had never appeared in her life.

“Ah!”

Zhao Xueyin could not take this blow. She took the phone and smashed it hard on the windshield.

PA —

A big crack appeared on the windshield.

Cen Shaoqing was master five.

And Ye Zhuo was Cen Shaoqing’s girlfriend.

What was she then?

“Thinking of what she had done during this period, Zhao Xueyin felt that she was a joke. ”

She had always thought that she could marry master five and become the Empress of DK Financial Group.

And Now?

Everything had become a mirage.

Master five had become CEN Shaoqing.

The court lady of DK Financial Group had also become ye Zhuo.

“Unwilling, humiliated, and upset, Zhao Xueyin had mixed feelings in her heart. She lay on the steering wheel and cried loudly. ”

She had always been the most outstanding existence since she was young.

“But ever since ye Zhuo returned to Shunxi Financial Group, everything had changed. ”

Her pride and self-esteem were slowly being destroyed by Ye Zhuo.

“At this moment, Zhao Xueyin suddenly thought of Si Lu. ”

Si Lu liked her so much.

Si Lu would definitely help her.

Zhao Xueyin’s hands trembled as she picked up the phone.

“Although the screen of the phone was broken, it didn’t affect her usage. ”

Zhao Xueyin opened her contacts and dialed.

“”Sorry, the number you have dialed doesn’t exist.” ”

A cold electronic voice came from the other end.

It was very obvious.

The lawyer had blocked her.

Zhao Xueyin opened wechat again and added her as a friend.

“The lawyer had blocked her phone. It was probably just a momentary anger. As long as she took the initiative to add the lawyer’s wechat back, the lawyer would definitely forgive her. ”
