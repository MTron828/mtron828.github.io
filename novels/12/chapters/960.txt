“Cen Yuyan wiped her tears and smiled as she looked up. “No, I don’t regret it.” ”

The doctor nodded. “Then follow me to the operating theater now.”

Cen Yuyan followed the doctor’s footsteps.

“The operating light lit up, and an anesthetic was slowly injected into Cen Yuyan’s body. Cen Yuyan only felt a wave of sleepiness hit her, and she closed her eyes just like that. ”

“When she opened her eyes again, all she could see was white. ”

Where was this?

“Cen Yuyan was stunned for a moment, and her right hand subconsciously touched her lower abdomen. ”

It was a flat area.

Only then did Cen Yuyan realize that the child was gone.

All the beautiful things had turned into Phantoms last night.

“Thinking of all the things that happened last night, Cen Yuyan took a deep breath. ”

“At this moment, a phone suddenly rang in the quiet ward. ”

Cen Yuyan picked up her phone.

The Caller ID was song Chenyu’s name.

“Hello.”

Cen Yuyan’s tone sounded no different from usual.

“Song Chenyu heaved a sigh of relief when he heard Cen Yuyan’s voice. “Yuyan, you finally picked up the phone! Do you know how anxious Zhou Rui was when he couldn’t contact you last night! Where are you now?” ”

“Cen Yuyan tried her best to suppress the anger in her heart and said with a smile, “I’m at my house now. I want to beg my grandmother and mother to forgive me. I Can’t let my child be born without my grandmother and great-grandmother.” ”

“Song Chenyu continued, “Then why did you move all the things in the house?” ”

“”To put on an act for my mother and grandmother to see,”Cen Yuyan continued, “You know that my mother doesn’t like Zhou Rui. This is also a temporary measure.” ”

“Hearing this, song Chenyu heaved a sigh of relief. “Yuyan, it’s good that you’re fine! Do you want to talk to Zhou Rui?” ”

“”My mother will be here soon. I Won’t talk to him for now. Help me tell him not to worry. I’ll definitely think of a way to get my family to accept him!”! “No matter what, I already have Zhou Rui’s flesh and blood now. I believe that my grandmother and my mother will not be so heartless!” ”

“Song Chenyu scolded a fool in his heart, then he smiled and said, “Then I’ll wait for Your Good News.” ”

“En.”Cen Yuyan hung up the phone.

The hand that was holding the phone was trembling.

Wait.

She must make Zhou Rui and song Chenyu get their retribution!

“On the other side, song Chenyu turned to look at Zhou Rui. “Cen Yuyan has already returned to the CEN family.” ”

“Really?”Zhou Rui’s eyes lit up.

“Song Chenyu nodded, “I’ve already told you not to be so anxious. Cen Yuyan is the Cen family’s bloodline after all, so how could the Cen family really ignore her! From now on, you just need to wait for Cen Yuyan’s good news in peace!” ”

Zhou Rui was extremely excited.

“After leaving song Chenyu’s place, he immediately went back to tell the Zhou family’s parents the good news. ”

The Zhou family’s parents were also very excited.

“”Rui Rui, is what you said true? Is Cen Yuyan really going back?” ”

“Zhou rui smiled and said, “Of course it’s true! Father and mother, the two of you should follow behind me and enjoy your life!” ”

“Mother Zhou said with a face full of pride, “My Son is really amazing!” ”

All the young ladies in the city came knocking on their doors. How could they not be amazing?

“In the blink of an eye, a week passed. ”

Cen Yuyan was also successfully discharged from the hospital.

“Although she was discharged, she still had a big belly. ”

Cen Yuyan dragged her suitcase to the hotel and finally called Zhou Rui.

“After a week, she received another call from Cen Yuyan. Zhou Rui was especially excited. “Hello, Yuyan!” ”

“Cen Yuyan said, “Zhou Rui, it’s been so many days. Did you miss me?” ”

“Yes! Of course I have! Even in my dreams.”

“Cen Yuyan resisted the urge to vomit and continued, “Where Are You Now? Let’s Meet?” ”

“”Where are you? I’m coming to pick you up,”Zhou Rui immediately said. ”

“Cen Yuyan said, “I’m on Guohua Road near Our House.” ”

“”Okay, I’ll be there right away.” ”

Cen Yuyan also immediately took a taxi to Guohua Road.

“Cen Yuyan had just gotten out of the car when Zhou Rui arrived and hugged Cen Yuyan. “Yuyan, I missed you so much.” ”

“I missed you too.” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Zhou Rui did not notice the coldness in Cen Yuyan’s eyes and continued, “How was your trip back? Are Mom and Grandma willing to accept me?” ”

“Cen Yuyan shook her head. “Zhou Rui, I’m sorry for making you suffer. My mom and Grandma’s side...”the rest of her words were self-evident. ”

“The moment she finished speaking.., cEN Yuyan continued, “Actually, my mother’s side is still fine. It’s just that my grandmother is more stubborn. However, although they didn’t accept you, they accepted our child. They even said that our child will become the heir of our family in the future.” ”
