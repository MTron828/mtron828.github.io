“”In that case, Ye Lan is also a pitiful child.”Zhao Dan’s eyes were slightly red. “Miss Qiu, don’t make things difficult for her.” ”

“Qiu Di nodded and said in a gentle tone, “Madam, don’t worry. Miss Ye and I are old friends. Ye Lan is Miss Ye’s foster sister, so she is my sister. Why would I make things difficult for my own sister?” ”

“His words were kind and understanding, gentle and generous. No one would have thought that the instigator of this matter was her. ”

“Zhao Dan smiled at Qiu Di and continued, “Miss Qiu is indeed a bodhisattva.” ”

“”Madam, you must be joking.”Qiu di continued, “Don’t talk about me. If it were anyone else, they wouldn’t make things difficult for ye Lan either.” ”

Zhao Dan nodded. He was even more satisfied with Qiu Di.

“If the full moon wasn’t dead, it would be the same size as Qiu Di. When he thought of this, a loving look appeared in Zhao Dan’s eyes. ”

Her daughter would definitely be as gentle and beautiful as Qiu Di.

“Qiu Di was a little embarrassed as he touched his hair. “Why are you looking at me, Madam? Is there anything wrong with Qiu Di’s appearance?” ”

“”No.”Zhao Dan shook his head and continued, “I just suddenly remembered that if the full moon was still around, it would be the same size as you. If she was still around...” ”

“Qiu di smiled and said, “Madam, if you don’t mind, you can treat me as a full moon princess. It’s my honor to be the same age as a full moon princess.” ”

“Zhao Dan’s face was full of smiles, but the smile did not reach his eyes. ”

“Although Qiu Di was good, it could not replace the position of her eldest daughter in her heart. ”

...

Ye Lan was thrown out of the door by Ye Han.

Ye Lan sat on the ground and looked at Ye Han. “Ye Han! Do you think you haven’t seen Qiu Di’s true face? She is not ye Zao’s Savior at all! All of this is her trap!”

Ye Han looked at Qiu di without any expression on his face and did not say anything.

“”Ye Han, wake up!”Ye LAN continued, “If you don’t wake up, you’ll end up worse than me!” ”

“In the past, ye Lan thought that autumn flute was a good person and truly planned for them. ”

But now it seemed.

Ye Lan was a scheming woman from the beginning to the end!

“”When autumn flute takes this position, she won’t let you off! Ye Han, let’s Join Hands!” ”

“Saying this, Ye Lan’s eyes were filled with light. ”

Join hands.

“Once she joined hands with Ye Han, she would definitely see Hope! ”

“”I am Wu Han,”ye Han said in a cold tone. ”

“”No! You Are Ye Han! Don’t listen to that Slut Qiu di’s nonsense! You Are Ye Han!”Ye Lan looked at Ye Han, she tried to awaken his memories. “Ye Han, have you forgotten ye Zao? If it wasn’t for ye Zao back then, you would have died! You said that you would protect ye Zao for the rest of Your Life!” ”

“Hearing this, Ye Han suddenly felt a violent pain in his head. There seemed to be a white light flashing in his mind, but when he looked carefully, he could not see anything. It was as if the scene just now was an illusion. ”

“Slut! Qiu Di is a slut!”

Ye Han frowned slightly and rushed over. His right hand grabbed ye Lan’s neck. “Who are you calling a slut?”

Ye Han would not allow anyone to insult the autumn flute.

“Ye Lan’s eyes were red from being pinched. “Ye Han, let go of me quickly! I was wrong, let go of me!” ”

“”Say it again, my name is Wu Han.” ”

“”Wu Han! Wu Han!”Ye Lan immediately changed her words. “Let go of me first, I swear I won’t dare.” ”

“Only then did ye Han let go of Ye Lan’s neck. He clapped his hands and stood up, looking at ye Lan just like that. His gaze was full of warning. “If I hear you insult the eldest miss again, I’ll make this day next year become your death anniversary.” ”

“Ye Lan hugged her neck, breathing in large mouthfuls of fresh air. ”

Just now. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

She almost thought that she was going to die.

“Ye Han looked at Ye Lan as if he was looking at an ant. In a moment, he turned around and left. ”

“Looking at Ye Han’s back that was about to disappear from her sight, ye Lan raised her voice and shouted, “Ye Han! Ye Han!” ”

But Ye Han did not even turn his head.

“Ye Lan sat on the spot, almost crying her eyes out. ”

She regretted it.

She really regretted it.

“She regretted being in cahoots with Qiu Di, and even more regretted listening to Qiu Di’s slander and giving up the management rights of the Ye family base to her. ”

What should she do now?

What should she do?

Nothing.

She had nothing now.

Her only hope was to find her biological parents.

“After a long time, ye Lan realized. ”

She still had her parents to rely on.

Right.

She needed to find her biological parents right away.

“Even if her biological parents were ordinary people, she would accept it. ”
