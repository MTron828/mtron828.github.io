“Lin Qingxuan said, “My name is Lin Qingxuan, Shuangmu Lin, Qingfeng’s Qing, and the imposing Xuan. I’m forty-two years old this year, and I’m the fourth oldest in my family. I think you should be a few years younger than me. If you don’t mind, you can follow them and call me fourth brother Lin.” ”

“Xia Xiaoman nodded and said with a smile, “Fourth brother Lin, I’m actually not much younger than you. I’m forty-one years old this year.” ”

“Hearing this, Lin Qingxuan was a little surprised. “I thought you were about the same age as Mama Searing!”He didn’t expect Xia Xiaoman to also step into the fortieth level. ”

“Xia Xiaoman smiled and said, “Mama searing is two years younger than me.” ”

“Seeing that it was getting late, Xia Xiaoman invited Lin Qingxuan to dinner again. ”

“Lin Qingxuan felt that it was very easy for him and Xia Xiaoman to get along, so he nodded and agreed. ”

It was not until evening that Lin Qingxuan returned to the Lin family.

“As soon as he reached home, he was stopped by Old Lady Lin. “Qingxuan, I want to discuss something with you.” ”

“Go ahead.”Lin Qingxuan turned to look at Old Lady Lin.

“Old Lady Lin continued, “You’ve met Su ran today. Have you considered settling the matter?” ”

All of Lin Qingxuan’s good mood disappeared in an instant.

“”Mom, I’ll tell you one more time. Jiang Su ran and I are not suitable for each other. Don’t worry about it.” ”

“Madam Lin’s face was stern, “Su ran, that child has a body, looks, face, and family background! Most importantly, she’s a virgin! Why is she not good enough for you?” ”

“Feng Qianhua had personally introduced Jiang Su ran, and Jiang Su ran was very good at causing trouble, so Madam Lin was very satisfied with her. ”

“”It’s not that she’s not good enough, it’s just that she’s not suitable!”Lin Qingxuan continued, “Mom, I’m begging you, can you just leave me alone?” ”

“”I’m Your Mom! I don’t care who cares about you!”Saying this.., madam Lin Sighed, “I know you still have some resentment against me because of what happened to Zhao shuning! But it’s already happened. Even if you’re angry at me, it’s useless! Qingxuan, can’t you give me a chance to make it up to you?” ”

“It had been more than three months since Zhao Shuning’s incident, but Lin Qingxuan had been brooding over it. ”

“Twenty years ago, Lin Qingxuan had already compromised once. This time, he would never compromise again. “Mother, the best way to make it up to me is to not interfere in my affairs! Unless you want to repeat what happened to Zhao Shuning!” ”

“After saying this, Lin Qingxuan turned around and walked into the room. ”

“Old Lady Lin clutched her chest, almost fainting from anger. ”

“”Old Lady, Are You Alright?”Auntie Zhang immediately ran over to support Old Lady Lin. ”

“Unfilial son! I’ve raised an unfilial son!”

“Auntie Zhang continued, “Old Lady, Master Yu is coming tomorrow. The most important thing for you now is to have a good rest. You must not be distracted by small matters when you receive important guests tomorrow.” ”

The most important reason was that old madam Lin was going to introduce Feng Xianxian in front of Master Yu Tomorrow.

What if Lin Qingxuan’s matter affected Feng Xianxian’s important matter?

“Hearing this, Old Madam Lin wiped her tears. “You’re right! Serious matters are more important! We’ll talk about other matters later!” ”

Feng residence.

Feng Qianhua brought a set of clothes to Feng Xianxian’s room.

“”Xianxian, wear this set of clothes and come with me to the Lin Residence Tomorrow.” ”

“Feng Xianxian took the clothes and asked curiously, “Is there anything special about this set of clothes?” ”

“Feng Qianhua continued, “Tomorrow, Master Yu will come to the Lin residence. I’ve already made an agreement with your grandmother Lin to let her introduce you to Master Yu. So, you must perform well in front of Master Yu Tomorrow and strive to let Master Yu See you and take you in as his last disciple.” ”

“Master Yu?”Feng Xianxian was puzzled. “Is it master Yu from the literary world?”

“Yes.”Feng Qianhua nodded.

“Mom! Really?”Feng Xianxian was very excited.

“Master Yu was a great person in the literary world. There was no one in China who did not know of him. Thirty years ago, master Yu took in a child prodigy as his disciple. It was said that that disciple had already surpassed master Yu, if she was lucky enough to become Master Yu’s last disciple, what kind of glory would that be? ”

“”Of course it’s true!”Feng Qianhua continued, “Master Yu and master Lin have a good relationship. Master Lin left early, so your grandmother Lin’s words carry a lot of weight in front of him! Xianxian, you must not disappoint me tomorrow!” ”

“Feng Xianxian nodded firmly. “Mom, don’t Worry!”After giving up on the path of the scientific and technological world, Feng Xianxian had completely shifted her focus to the literature association. ”
