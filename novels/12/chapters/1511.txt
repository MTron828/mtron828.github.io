“If it was just contraception, the crime might have been a little less serious, but it was not a small problem as it endangered the safety of his life! ”

This was attempted murder!

“Xiao Wu continued, “In addition, the medicine found in the suspect’s servant’s room and on his body were the same medicine as the medicine in the medicine! “Also, I’ve asked the servants of the Lin family. They all said that the person responsible for the victim’s daily meals and drinking the medicine was Ma Guizhi!” ”

Ma Guizhi was Auntie Sun’s full name.

“Hearing this, Ma Guizhi could not remain calm. Her face was extremely pale, “I’m wronged! Officer comrade, I’m really wronged! I didn’t know that this medicine would harm life and health. I thought that this was just an ordinary birth control pill!”Attempted murder was punishable by imprisonment, not only imprisonment, it would also leave a criminal record and affect the three generations of immediate family members! ”

“If the crime was found guilty, it would be difficult for Sun Jiayi to marry into a wealthy family in the future! ”

“When a wealthy family got married, they would investigate the three generations of immediate family members so as not to affect the future career of their descendants. ”

No.

She couldn’t go to jail.

Captain Zhou turned to look at Ma Guizhi. “Didn’t you just deny that you didn’t put anything in the victim’s medicine?”

Boom!

Ma Guizhi was struck by lightning. Only then did she realize that she had accidentally confessed!

“One wrong step, one wrong step! ”

“Anyway, they had already come this far, ma guizhi continued, “Officer! I really didn’t know that the medicine would harm people! I didn’t do it on purpose! Please forgive me just this once, okay? Officer, please give me a Chance!” Ma Guizhi really didn’t know. At that time, she only wanted to prevent Xia Xiaoman from getting pregnant. ”

“She didn’t expect that the medicine would be so poisonous. No matter how Bold Ma Guizhi was, she didn’t dare to harm people. ”

“”I say, you’re really wicked!”Captain Zhou looked at Ma Guizhi, “Even if there’s nothing harmful in the medicine, you can’t just add it to Mrs. Lin’s food and medicine. Did you really think that your daughter would rise to the top just because Mrs. Lin can’t get pregnant? Now, not only did you harm yourself, but you also harmed your daughter! This is the consequence of having bad intentions!” ”

“”Officer comrade, I’m sorry. I really know my mistake. I didn’t do it on purpose!” ”

“”If I’m sorry is useful, then there’s no need for US police officers to exist. Since I’ve done something wrong, I must pay the price for my actions!”In front of the law, everyone was equal! ”

“Ma guizhi continued, “Comrade police officer, this matter has nothing to do with my daughter. Please let her go quickly! If you want to lock her up, lock me up alone! “I did all these things alone. My daughter doesn’t know anything!”The matter had already developed to this point, she had to protect Sun Jiayi. She couldn’t let Sun Jiayi suffer this undeserved disaster again. ”

This was her idea all along. It was all her fault from start to finish! ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

On the other side.

The Lin family.

It was originally an Lizi’s birthday and a happy day. She didn’t expect such a thing to happen.

“Lin Qingxuan, Xia Xiaoman’s family of three, Ye Zhuo, and Cen Shaoqing had gone to the police station to take statements. They hadn’t returned yet. A few sisters-in-law sat in the living room, feeling anxious. ”

“At that moment, footsteps and voices came from outside the door. ”

“Ye Shu immediately stood up. “Fourth brother, fourth sister-in-law, they’re back!” ”

“Wu Mei, Yang Wenyin, and Zhang Zhenzhen also stood up and looked in the direction of the door. ”

“In the next second, a few figures walked in from outside the door. ”

“As expected, Lin Qingxuan and the others had returned. ”

“”Fourth brother, fourth sister-in-law, how is it?” ”

Ye Shu went up and asked.

“Xia Xiaoman said, “The police have already detected that there’s something wrong with the medicine. Sister-in-law sun has also confessed. She’s the one who insisted that Sun Jiayi wasn’t involved in this matter! “There’s also no direct evidence to prove that Sun Jiayi was involved. If Sun Jiayi insists on not admitting it, there might be some trouble!” ”

Ye Shu frowned slightly. “How could this be!”

“Wu Mei said, “Don’t worry. I believe that the police will not let a bad person off. They will definitely have a way to make Sun Jiayi confess!” ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Aunt is right. Fourth aunt, don’t worry! The law will always be in place. I believe that the police will definitely have a way to make Sun Jiayi confess.” ”

“Xia Xiaoman nodded. She looked at ye Zhuo and said, “Zhuo Zhuo, it’s all thanks to you this time. If it wasn’t for you, your fourth uncle and I would still be in the Dark!”Ye Zhuo had saved Xia Xiaoman twice. ”

The first time was when Anton Liang was having an affair. It was ye Zao’s words that gave her hope.
