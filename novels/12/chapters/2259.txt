“When she saw Lin Ze, the light in Bai Jingshu’s eyes lit up almost immediately. ”

This feeling was difficult to describe with boring words.

She was... very excited.

“Mr. Lin!”Bai Jingshu shouted.

Bai Jingshu brought reinforcements?

Chen Yaosheng frowned slightly. He had an ominous feeling in his heart. He turned around and looked.

He saw Lin Ze.

“Immediately, Chen Yaosheng’s face was filled with disdain. ”

He thought that Bai Jingshu was very capable and that she had invited some big shot. It turned out that she was just an ordinary earthling. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

She was just a low-level earthling. He could crush her to death with a single finger.

“Chen Yaosheng turned around and looked at Lin Ze. He continued, “I’m in a good mood today and I don’t want to fight. If you don’t want to die, then get lost! Otherwise, don’t blame me for being Rude!” ”

“At this moment, Chen Yaosheng had no time to think about why Lin Ze would appear here. ”

“After all, he had only sent two core robots to deal with Lin Ze. ”

“Lin Ze didn’t say anything. When Bai Jingshu called him, he was in a meeting, so he was still wearing a formal suit with a white shirt and black suit pants that were pressed straight. It was somewhat inconvenient for everyone to wear a formal suit. Lin Ze raised his hand slightly, just like that, he unbuttoned the first or second button on his shirt. Then, he rolled up his sleeves, revealing a section of his strong arm. ”

“Seeing Lin Ze’s intention, Chen Yaosheng snorted. “Trying to hit a rock with an egg? You’re overestimating yourself!” ”

“Later, this lowly person would not even know how he died. ”

“It was also at this moment that Bai Jingshu realized that in front of Chen Yaosheng, Lin Ze was just an ordinary human being. ”

She should not have dragged Lin ze into this!

“Mr. Lin! Run! Run!”Bai Jingshu shouted.

Lin Ze did not say anything.

“Since he was here, he would not sit idly by. ”

“He wanted to save Bai Jingshu, and he wanted to beat up the scum! ”

“However, before the fight, he seemed to lack a handy tool. ”

He swept his gaze around and saw a drumstick at the corner of the room.

It was a tool used to beat drums.

Lin Ze turned around and walked to the side.

“Looking at Lin Ze’s back, Chen Yaosheng smiled. “Only thinking of leaving now. Is it too late?” ”

“After saying that, Chen Yaosheng pulled out the laser gun at his waist and shot at the back of Lin Ze’s head. ”

“As a person from the s galaxy, no one understood the power of the laser gun better than Bai Jingzhu. ”

“Once he was hit by the Laser Gun, Lin Ze would definitely die! ”

“No!”Bai Jingzhu widened her eyes and shouted.

Chen yaosheng naturally ignored Bai Jingzhu. He pulled the trigger and fired.

“”Mr. Lin, run!”Bai Jingzhu wanted to run over and block the laser beam, but she could not move at all. It was as if there were millions of pounds of rock pressing on her body. It was very difficult for her to even breathe. ”

“Bai Jingshu’s eyes widened at that moment, as if they were about to pop out. ”

This was a reaction that only a person would have when they were in extreme danger.

“Although it was only for a moment, Bai Jingshu was filled with regret. She regretted her recklessness. She shouldn’t have sent Lin ze a message. ”

“If something happened to Lin Ze, she would first kill Chen Yaosheng, this scumbag, and then pay with Lin Ze’s life. ”

“At this moment, Lin Ze’s figure flashed, and he accurately avoided the red laser beam. ”

No one expected Lin ze to avoid the laser beam.

Especially Chen Yaosheng.

“His eyes were filled with disbelief. After all, Lin Ze was just an ordinary human. ”

How could an ordinary human have such an agile reaction?

“In the next second, before Chen Yaosheng could react, a drumstick was swung over. ”

A severe warning!

Bang!

Chen Yaosheng’s vision went black. There was an explosive pain coming from his temple. He reached out and touched it. There was a sticky feeling. Chen Yaosheng placed his finger in front of his eyes. It was red and shocking.

He was bleeding.

“Chen Yaosheng was shocked and embarrassed. He had grown up, but no one dared to treat him like this. ”

This was also the first time Chen Yaosheng was bleeding.

This reckless earthling actually dared to hurt him!

Bai Jingshu also felt a little cold.

“After a while, she remembered something. ”

Lin Ze was ye Zao’s older brother.

“Ye Zao was so powerful. As his older brother, Lin Ze’s backing would definitely not be too bad. ”

“Thinking of this, Bai Jingshu felt a lot better. ”

She thought that Lin Ze would definitely die this time.

Fortunately.

“Fortunately, there was always a way out. ”

“However, Chen Yaosheng was not someone to be trifled with. After all, he grew up in the s galaxy and had learned a lot of self-defense skills. He immediately clenched his fists and activated the Level-2 equipment on his body. instantly.., his body was wrapped in a piece of steel armor. ”
