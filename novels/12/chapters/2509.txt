“Although he did not announce the contents of the proposal on the island, the entry of the proposal made it onto the hot searches of all the major websites. ”

# CEN Wuye proposed! #

# Dr. YC’s wedding date will be set! #

# Qing Mu Burning Dessert is free #

“The comments under each entry were more than 100,000 + . ”

[ Ah Ah Ah! received customized desserts from miss ye and Wuye! Zhu 99! [ photo jpg ]

Yes.

“In order to have fun with everyone, cen Shaoqing personally designed a dessert and specially gave it away for free on the day of his proposal. ”

“As long as one was a citizen of China, they could receive it for free with their ID card. ”

[ poster is so lucky to receive it so quickly! I’m still waiting in line bitterly! Number 3256! I don’t know when I’ll be able to get it! ]

“[ I saw that many people posted it on my wechat moments, and I thought it was fake! I didn’t expect the free dessert to be real! Again, is it really free? ] ”

[ it’s really free! The prerequisite is that you have a Chinese ID card! ]

[ I’ll go right away! ]

“[ I got it too, the dessert is really super delicious, and the design is very unique. The only flaw is that I only remembered to take a photo after I F * CKING finished it! F * ck! ] ”

“...”

“It was rare for everyone to gather on the island. At night, Cen Shaoqing held a grand bonfire banquet on the island. ”

“Men and women, wearing their favorite clothes, danced around the bonfire and sang. ”

The scene was very lively.

“Although the South China Sea was hot during the day, the temperature at night was not high, so it was not hot at all for everyone to dance around the bonfire. ”

The temperature was just right.

Cen Shaoqing also prepared fireworks.

“When the gorgeous fireworks bloomed in the night sky, they even illuminated the blue sea surface. ”

The water and sky were the same color.

It was exceptionally spectacular.

“Ye Zhuo held a goblet and sat on the beach, gently shaking the wine in the goblet. ”

“As the goblet shook, the red liquid in the goblet also rippled in circles. ”

“The bright night reflected on her eyes and brows, making her look a little cold. After a moment, she turned to look at CEN Shaoqing and said, “How long did you prepare for today?” ”

Cen Shaoqing took a sip of the wine and opened his thin lips. “Not long.”

About three months.

Ye Zhuo leaned his head on his shoulder and looked up at the fireworks in the night sky. “Did you come up with all these things by yourself?”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “I’ve said that I want to give you a marriage proposal ceremony that you will never forget in your life.”

“Since he wanted to be unforgettable in his life, he naturally couldn’t give it to someone else. ”

“I’ve improved.”Ye Zhuo’s eyes were curved and filled with the color of stars. “I’m very pleased.”

Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips curved slightly. “Why do you want to be my father every day?” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“You don’t want to?”Ye Zhuo asked.

Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddha beads. “I’ll be fine in one place. You can do whatever you want in the other places.”

“Where?”Ye Zhuo asked curiously.

Cen Shaoqing lowered his voice and said two words in a low voice.

“It was a very, very soft voice. ”

It was so soft that only ye Zhuo could hear it clearly.

“Ye Zhuo’s ears immediately turned red. He said, “Shameless.”Then, he stood up with the Buddha beads in his hands and walked in the direction of the crowd. ”

“Cen Shaoqing looked at her back, his eyes curved. ”

“As soon as ye Zao walked over, an Lizi pulled him over to dance with her. ”

“”Da Zao Zao, your husband has really surprised me!” ”

“”Yes, yes, yes,”Li Yueyue and Zhao pingting echoed. “Pingting and I never thought that master five would have a romantic relationship.” ”

What was even more interesting was that Cen Shaoqing actually thought of taking ye Zao’s good friends over.

“If it was anyone else, they might not be able to do this. ”

“”You really know how to teach people!”Zhao pingting continued, “Great Zao, teach me too!” ”

“Teach me too!”

“Little White appeared out of nowhere, it said very proudly, “Great Zao is of course powerful! Otherwise, how could I be the most handsome, the most intelligent, and the most adorable sweeping robot in the entire universe! After all, I inherited my father’s business!” ”

“Since ye Zhuo was so powerful, as ye Zhuo’s only son, he naturally felt honored! ”

“Ye Zhuo looked at little white and said in surprise, “Doggie, why are you here too!” ”

Little White crossed its arms in front of its chest. “I’ve been here for a long time! It’s just that you’re lost in love and haven’t seen me yet!”

Ye Zhuo chuckled.

“Little White!”

“Oh my God! Master Five is too thoughtful. He actually arranged for Xiao Bai to come here!”

Zhao Pingting and Li Yueyue were Xiao Bai’s hardcore fans. They immediately hugged Xiao Bai and took photos of him.
