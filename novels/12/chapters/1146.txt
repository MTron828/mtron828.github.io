Translator: 549690339

“That’s enough. Let’s go.”

“Looking at ye Zhuo’s back, Zhao Xueyin suddenly felt a little flustered. ”

Could it be...

She really made a mistake?

Was this just a farce?

No.

It couldn’t be.

Ye Zhuo was definitely acting.

Ma Jiayue wouldn’t make a mistake.

Zhao Xueyin tried her best to calm herself down.

The few of them got into the police car together and arrived at the hospital.

Auntie Wang led the few of them to the inpatient department.

“Zhao Xueyin said, “Auntie Wang, you’re going the wrong way!” ”

Shouldn’t they be going to the morgue?

“Auntie Wang said, “They’re not going the wrong way. My wife lives in this building.” ”

Zhao Xueyin’s heart was getting more and more flustered.

They arrived at the third floor of the inpatient department.

There were a total of three people living in the ward.

“At this moment, the other two patients were not there. ”

Only Su Qiang was sitting on the bed alone.

“When he saw that Auntie Wang had brought so many people over, including the police, Su Qiang thought that something had happened. He stood up a little nervously. “Her mother, What’s Wrong?” ”

“Auntie Wang did not know how to explain herself. She pointed at Su Qiang and said, “Comrade police officer, this is my wife, Su Qiang. Look, I’ve already said it. Is He Alright?” ”

Zhao Xueyin’s face instantly turned red.

He’s not dead!

He’s really not dead!

How could this be!

“Zhao xueyin continued, “Even if he’s not dead, Ye Zhuo is also to blame! She’s practicing medicine without a license, which aggravates the patient’s condition. Officer, this kind of behavior also constitutes a crime, right?” ”

Officer Wang nodded.

This kind of behavior really does constitute a crime!

PA —

“At this moment, the Doctor pushed the door open and walked in. “Which one of You is Su Qiang’s family member?” ”

“I am.”Auntie Wang immediately walked over.

“The doctor looked at Auntie Wang and continued, “After our careful examination, Su Qiang’s diabetes has indeed been cured. You can get ready and be discharged today!” ”

“At the end of his sentence, the doctor sighed, “This is simply a miracle in medicine!” ”

Boom!

Zhao Xueyin felt as if she had been struck by lightning.

How could this be?

She had recovered.

She had really recovered.

“Ye Zhuo turned to look at officer Wang. “Officer, comrade, what should you do now?” ”

“Officer Wang looked at Zhao Xueyin. “Miss Zhao, please apologize to miss ye immediately and come with us.” ”

Apologize?

Make Her apologize to Ye Zhuo?

No!

Impossible.

What right did she have to apologize to Ye Zhuo?

“Zhao Xueyin raised her head to look at Ye Zhuo, “Even if your prescription is fine, it’s still a crime for you to practice medicine without a license! What right do I have to apologize to you? You were lucky this time and accidentally cured diabetes. If someone were to die from the treatment, who would be responsible? Officer Wang, do you think it’s my fault or ye Zhuo’s fault?” ”

“Of course, it was practicing medicine without a license! ”

Officer Wang looked at Ye Zhuo. “Do you have a medical license?”

Zhao Xueyin’s eyes flashed with sarcasm.

Ye Zhuo studied chemistry. How could she have a medical license.

“Even if ye Zhuo studied medicine, she still had not graduated. ”

She had not graduated yet.

Did she really think that it was so easy to get a medical license?

Ye Zhuo unzipped his backpack unhurriedly and handed officer Wang a document. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Officer Wang took the document with both hands and read it carefully before returning it to Ye Zhuo.

“”Miss Zhao, Miss Ye has three certificates and is not practicing medicine without a license! You’d better hurry up and apologize to her! Everyone is quite busy!” ”

Officer Wang was already a little impatient.

“If Zhao Xueyin had not been fooling around, she would not have made such a big mistake. ”

Zhao Xueyin’s face was very pale.

She had a certificate!

Ye Zhuo actually had a certificate.

And he had all three certificates.

Where did ye Zhuo get his certificate?

“”It’s fake!”Zhao Xueyin said, “Her certificate must be fake!” ”

“Officer Wang said, “Don’t tell me I can’t tell if it’s fake or not? Hurry up and apologize!” ”

“Zhao Xueyin bit her lip, feeling very indignant. ”

“She had thought that ye Zao was dead for sure this time, but who would have thought that ye Zao would actually be able to survive. ”

Cure Diabetes?

How could ye Zao’s medical skills be so good!

What exactly was going on?

“Under the current situation, Zhao Xueyin could only bite the bullet and apologize. ”

“”Miss Ye, I’m sorry. I misunderstood you.” ”

“Ye Zhuo looked at her and said, “Trash!” ”

She rarely swore.

This was the first time.

Zhao Xueyin really disgusted her.

She remembered that the last time she met such a disgusting person was Zhou Chenyu.

It was also the first time Zhao Xueyin was so blatantly called trash.

Her face was full of humiliation.

Just wait.

She would definitely take revenge for today.

Make Ye Zhuo regret his actions today!

“After Zhao Xueyin apologized, officer Wang and a few other officers also apologized to Ye Zhuo. They also apologized to Wang Sao and Su Qiang before leaving. ”
