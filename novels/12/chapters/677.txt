“Li Yueyue went through a whole bunch of things, but she didn’t get to the main point. ”

“Milo said anxiously, “Then hurry up and tell me. I’m dying of anxiety.” ”

“Li Yueyue hesitated for a moment, “Just use the dog SH * t that’s cooked and apply it on the areas that get frostbite every year. I promise, as long as you apply it once, you won’t get frostbite in the future!” ”

“What?”Milo looked at Li Yueyue in disbelief. “Dog Sh * t?”

It’s even cooked?

Did she not hear wrongly? Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Even ye Zao was a little surprised. She had studied Chinese medicine for so many years, but she had never known that Dog Sh * t could cure frostbite. ”

“Li Yueyue nodded very seriously, “It’s dog Sh * t! I’m not joking with you! Look at my ears and look at my hands. I used to love frostbite. Now, no matter how cold the weather is, I won’t get Frostbite!” ”

Milo gulped. “This is too strong!”

Putting Dog Sh * t on her ears?

The scene was too beautiful for her to imagine.

Li Yueyue pinched a snow ball. “It’s just a DAB. It’s not like I’m eating it. It’s actually nothing.”

“Doesn’t dog SH * t stink after it’s cooked?”Milo asked.

“Li Yueyue said, “It’s okay. Dog Sh * t doesn’t stink too bad after it’s cooked. Xiaomi, if you want to try it, I can cook it for you personally!” ”

“Milo hurriedly shook her head. “Forget it! I Can’t get over my own psychological state! Yueyue, can’t you recommend a more reliable folk prescription?” ”

“Li Yueyue didn’t think much of it. After all, every family in their area was like that. “This is very reliable! People in our area use this folk prescription! I won’t tell ordinary people about it!” ”

“”No, no, no! Forget it!”Mi Lu still refused. ”

Her frostbite liked to grow on her face. Could it be that she had to wipe dog shit on her face?

Just thinking about it made her feel like she couldn’t accept it.

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “I also know a folk remedy for frostbite. Xiaomi, you can try it.” ”

“What folk remedy?”Mi Lu hurriedly asked.

“Ye Zao continued, “Put the Hawthorn on the stove and bake it until it is soft. After it cools, rub it into mud and spread it on the frostbite. Rub it while rubbing until the Hawthorn is dry. Apply it about three times a day. After ten days, it should be enough.” ”

Mi Lu nodded and quickly took out her phone to write down the method ye Zao had mentioned.

Li Yue Yue hugged mi Lu’s shoulder. “The method that da Zao mentioned is definitely not as good as mine!”

“But I really can’t do it with Dog Sh * T.”

“Li Yue Yue smiled and said, “Isn’t dog SH * t a little smelly? Look at the celestial water that we usually use. Isn’t it also smelly?” ”

Mi Lu nodded. “The celestial water is indeed smelly.”

“As they spoke, the two of them began to seriously discuss which brand of skin care product was good. ”

Ye Zhuo turned to look at the two of them. “What do you two want to Eat Tonight?”

“When it came to eating, their eyes immediately lit up. ”

“Mi Lu said, “On a snowy day, of course it goes better with hot pot!” ”

“Yeah! I want to eat hot pot too!”Li Yueyue nodded in agreement.

“Ye Zhuo also liked hot pot. “Alright, let’s go eat hot pot then.” ”

“Mi Lu said, “I heard that the Ye family’s private kitchen’s hot pot is very delicious! Why don’t we go to the Ye family’s private kitchen?” ”

“Li Yueyue frowned slightly. “The ye family’s private kitchen’s rabbit meat hot pot is delicious, but there are too many people. Almost every time we go there, we have to queue!” ”

Ye Zhuo took out his phone. “Then let’s go to the ye family’s private kitchen. I can get us seats. We don’t have to queue there.”

“Really?”Mi Lu and Li Yueyue’s eyes lit up.

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Of course it’s true.”

The three of them took a taxi to the nearest branch of the Ye family’s private kitchen.

“At present, Ye Shu had already opened 12 branches in Beijing. ”

“Now, Ye Shu had already expanded the ye family’s private restaurant to the cities around Beijing. ”

“As soon as ye Zhuo and the others entered, they were personally received by the manager. “Miss Ye, please follow me this way.” ”

Milo and Li Yueyue looked at each other and saw the surprise in each other’s eyes.

“The two of them thought that ye Zhuo was bragging, but they didn’t expect that ye Zhuo really had a way. ”

“After sitting in the private room, Li Yueyue said curiously, “Da Zao Zao, I didn’t hear that the Ye’s private dishes have a membership system! How did you do it? Do you know the person-in-charge of their family?” ”

Ye Zao didn’t hide it. “The owner of the Ye’s private dishes is my mother.”

“”D * MN!”Milo covered her mouth in surprise. “Zao Zao, didn’t you say that your mother is a caterer?” ”

“Ye zhuo slightly nodded, “Yes! My mother is doing catering Ah.” ”
