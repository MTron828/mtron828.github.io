“Zhang Hong was speechless, she sighed and said, “Mom, it’s not that I don’t trust him, but this matter shouldn’t have developed in this direction in the first place. Since this matter hasn’t happened yet, there’s still room for redemption. Once the truth is revealed, the army will be finished for the rest of their lives!” ”

“”Zhang Hong, you can not support the army, but can you not pour cold water on the Army?”The Queen Mother was really angry. All these years, she had been working hard to be a good mother-in-law and never had an argument with her daughter-in-law, but today, she really could not hold it in anymore. ”

“If you don’t steam the Mantou to fight for your pride, some people would usually give her too much face, which was why she would follow your face and climb up your head! ”

“Zhang Hong also saw the change in her mother-in-law’s mood, then she said, “Mom, actually, I don’t have any other intentions. As the wife of the Army and your daughter-in-law, I also hope that the army can fight for a better future, but you have to consider the consequences of doing anything.” ”

“At this point, Zhang Hong paused and said, “Of course, if the army has already thought it through and has to do this, then I will still support him.” ”

“Hearing this, mother Wang’s expression softened a little. She turned to look at doctor Wang and said, “Army, you can be at ease and do it boldly. In any case, I will support you no matter what!” ”

“Doctor Wang looked at mother Wang and immediately turned to leave. Mother Wang immediately asked, “Army, where are you going?” ”

“Wang Dajun turned around and said, “I’m going out to do something. I’ll be right back.” ”

Weiwei’s surgery could not be delayed any longer. She had to find her parents immediately.

“Very soon, Wang Dajun contacted Weiwei’s parents. ”

“At first, when they heard that Weiwei was sick and was hospitalized, the two of them refused to take care of Weiwei. After all, they had their own families. Who would be willing to take care of a burden. However, when they heard that Weiwei was now a famous cartoonist, their faces instantly changed. ”

“Are you saying that Weiwei’s monthly salary is so high now?”Liu Meilian made a “Six”gesture.

“Wang Dajun nodded. “Yes, so you don’t have to worry about Weiwei’s medical expenses at all. She can totally pay for it herself.” ”

“Xiang Chao immediately asked, “Doctor Wang, where is my daughter now? Is She Alright?” ”

“”What Your Daughter!”Liu Meilian said speechlessly, “I don’t know who just said that Weiwei is a burden and doesn’t want her! “Weiwei was born after I carried her for ten months, so Weiwei is my daughter! “It has nothing to do with you!” ”

“”If it weren’t for me, would you have given birth to Weiwei by yourself?”Xiang Chao stood up from his chair. “What a joke!” ”

“Liu Meilian continued, “Have you ever cared about Weiwei after she was born? Do you look like a father at all?” ”

“”You make it sound like you do.”Xiang Chao was not someone to be trifled with. “Don’t forget, all these years, my mother has been the one to take care of Weiwei!” ”

“Wang Dajun felt a headache coming on and continued, “The two of you, now is not the time for you to argue. If anything happens to Weiwei, the two of you will really be left with nothing!” ”

Xiang Chao and Liu Meilian immediately shut up. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Then what should we do now?”Xiang Chao asked.

“Wang Dajun continued, “The two of you will first go to the hospital with me and sign the surgical book. After that, let Weiwei recuperate before we talk about the rest of the matter.” ”

“”Yes, yes, yes.”Xiang Chao nodded. “Then we’ll listen to Doctor Wang!” ”

“Although Liu Meilian was a little angry, she did not say much. After all, what Wang Dajun said was very right. ”

“In the current situation, it was still more important to protect Weiwei’s life. ”
