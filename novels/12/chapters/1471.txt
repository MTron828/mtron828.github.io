Translator: 549690339

“Looking at Yala who was pouncing on him, ye Zao calmly pressed down on the hat on his head and said in a faint voice, “Don’t panic. Stand further away.” ”

“Carl took a few steps back. “An, be careful!” ”

Ye Zao acted as if he didn’t hear Carl’s words and continued to act nonchalantly. “Mind your own business.”

It was also at this moment that Carl realized that Yala’s men were walking towards him.

“Although Carl’s skills were average, he could still barely see. At the very least, it would not be a problem for him to deal with one of Yala’s men. ”

“On Ye Zao’s side, Yala clenched his fists and pounced towards him with a murderous aura. ”

It was as if Mount Tai was pressing down on him.

“Ye Zao gently raised his hand and just like that, he clenched Yala’s fist. ” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

It was as if someone had pressed the pause button in the air.

Yala looked at ye Zao with shock in his eyes.

He caught it!

Someone actually caught his fist just like that.

“Before Yala could react, ye Zao raised his left leg and gave a backward kick, followed by a shoulder throw. ”

Carl’s eyes were wide open.

He watched as ye Zao lifted Yala up and threw him onto the ground.

“The whole process was very intense, and Ya Lei was also beaten badly. However, ye Zao did not even mess up her hair, and her black hat was still firmly pressed on her head. ”

Bang.

It hit ya Lei’s head.

“The head was the most vulnerable part of the human body. Ya Lei only felt a pain as if his skull had exploded. It was as if more than a dozen cars had crushed him, and then he fell heavily to the ground. ”

Puff.

He spat out a mouthful of blood.

It was as if his chest had been burned by fire.

He had been on the streets for more than thirty years. This was the first time in history that Yala had met such a powerful opponent.

“Moreover, he was so young. ”

Yala was not convinced.

“He had been dominating for so many years, but now he was like a dead dog. He was beaten to the ground and was in a sorry state. ”

He wanted to get up.

He did not believe that he would lose to a little girl.

“But just as his hands were propped on the ground, intense pain came from his internal organs. ”

He could not get up.

He actually could not get up.

Yala glared at Ye Zao.

“However, the person in question acted as if nothing had happened. He sat in front of his desk, his long legs crossed as he looked at Yala on the ground. ”

“Yala’s subordinates wanted to help, but they were also controlled by Carl. ”

They couldn’t do anything even if they wanted to.

“After a while, ye Zao took a sip of tea and stood up. “Mr. Yala, that’s all for today! If you dare to make things difficult for my friend again, I’m afraid that La Nindo casino will have a new generation! Do you understand?” ”

“With these words, not only Yala, even Mike, one of Carl’s subordinates, felt a chill on the back of his neck. ”

A change of dynasty.

“She meant to change the minister of La Nido Casino, but Yaly was the founder of La Nido. To change the dynasty of La Nido, unless... ”

Yaly was dead!

“After following Yaly for so long, this was the first time Mike saw Yaly meet an opponent. ”

“Moreover, this person was a little girl. ”

“If he didn’t see it with his own eyes, Mike would never believe it. ”

“Yala looked at ye Zao’s back and asked, “Are You Chinese?” ”

The only response to Yala was the sound of footsteps.

“Just as Yala thought that ye Zao would not reply, Ye Zao’s footsteps paused, and her clear voice sounded in the air, “Yes.” ”

“She had lived for two lifetimes, and she was Chinese. ”

“Yala laughed loudly. “The tricks of a Chinese cheater are indeed amazing! However, I’m not convinced that I lost to a Chinese! I’m not convinced!” ”

“Ye Zao looked back slightly, “There’s an old saying in our country called ‘the heart of a villain measures the stomach of a gentleman’! “Let me tell you, our Chinese people have never disdained to use underhanded tricks. Only what kind of person you are will think of others as what kind of person you are!” ”

“Do you dare to say that you didn’t use any tricks when you beat Hibbert last time?”Yala asked.

Ye Zao smiled faintly. “Do I need to use any tricks to defeat you?”

“Hearing this laughter, Yala held his breath. ”

What did ye Zao Mean by this?

Was he mocking him?

It was clearly ye Zao who had cheated.

But she refused to admit it!

“In this world, the winner was king, and the loser was a bandit. Now that he had been defeated by Ye Zao, even if he knew that ye Zao had cheated, what could he do? ”

What right did he have to make ye Zao admit it?

But Yaler was still not convinced.

“Just as ye Zao’s figure was about to leave his sight, Yaler suddenly spoke, “An, do you dare to bet with me? Do you dare? You Don’t dare! There is a saying in your country called ‘Guilty Conscience’! You are guilty conscience now!” ”
