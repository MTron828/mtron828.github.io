“What’s Wrong?”Cen Yuyan turned to look at Zhou Rui. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Zhou Rui continued, “Yuyan, let’s Go get the certificate tomorrow? I’ve just studied the calendar. Tomorrow’s Day will be very good.” ”

Cen Yuyan’s originally somewhat depressed mood was swept away at this moment. “Are you serious?”

Zhou Rui nodded. “Of course I’m serious.”

“Okay.”She knew that Zhou Rui was not that kind of person.

“Even though her household registration had been moved out by the Cen family, Zhou Rui still did not leave her. ”

“The next morning, Cen Yuyan and Zhou Rui arrived at the civil affairs bureau. ”

“Two hours later, the two of them received a red book each. ”

“Zhou Rui took a photo and said, “Yuyan, let’s post it on wechat moments?” ”

“Cen Yuyan’s wechat moments had Cen family members, and only this group of friends would post it. She believed that the CEN family members would soon know about their registration. ”

“Okay.”Cen Yuyan nodded and the editor posted a group of friends.

“Zhou rui smiled and said, “We still have to tell dad and mom about this. If they know that we’ve registered, they will definitely be very happy.” ”

“Okay.”Cen Yuyan’s face was full of happiness.

“Half an hour later, the two of them arrived at the Zhou family home. ”

“When the Zhou family’s parents heard that the two of them had already received their marriage certificate, they were indeed very happy. Especially mother Zhou, the smile on her face was almost overflowing, she held Cen Yuyan’s hand and said, “Yuyan, from now on, we will be a family! Oh right, have you discussed with your grandmother and the others about when the wedding will be held?” ”

“Cen Yuyan said, “Auntie, the wedding can be held at any time. There’s no need to discuss it with them.” ”

“Why are you still calling me auntie at a time like this?”Mother Zhou rebuked.

Cen Yuyan immediately changed her words. “Mom.”

“”That’s a good girl.”Mother Zhou patted Cen Yuyan’s hand and continued, “What do you want to eat? Auntie will make it for you?” ”

“Cen Yuyan smiled and said, “I’ll go and help you.” ”

“Mother Zhou said, “You’re a healthy person now, so you can’t do heavy work. Quickly sit down, I’ll Go!” ”

“Pregnant people were very emotional. Seeing mother Zhou treat her so well, CEN Yuyan was very touched. ”

“She was pregnant, and her biological mother and grandmother, including her biological sisters at home, let her have an abortion. ”

“But not only did mother Zhou not despise her for being old, she even loved her so much. ”

“It was said that the relationship between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law was the most difficult to handle, but in Cen Yuyan’s eyes, mother Zhou was even closer to her than her own mother. ”

“”Oh right, Yuyan, you haven’t said what you want to eat for lunch?”Mother Zhou continued to ask. ”

“Cen Yuyan said, “I’m not picky about food. Anything is fine.” ”

“Mother Zhou smiled and said, “Look at what you’re saying, how can you be so casual! Quickly tell me what you like to eat! I’ll go and make it for you!” ”

“Zhou rui followed, “Mother is right, we’re not outsiders. Just tell me what you want to eat.” ”

“I want to eat something sour.”

Want to eat something sour?

Mother Zhou’s eyes lit up.

This Cen Yuyan was definitely pregnant with someone with a penis!

“Otherwise, she wouldn’t want to eat something sour. ”

“Although mother Zhou despised Cen Yuyan, now, Cen Yuyan could not only bring wealth to the Zhou family, but she could also bring a big plate of grandchildren to the Zhou family. How could mother Zhou not be happy? ”

“In the future, the Zhou family would be famous in the capital! ”

“The more mother Zhou thought about it, the more excited she became. “Yuyan, wait for me. I’ll go make it for you.” ”

“”Thank you, Mother.” ”

“”Silly Child, why are you still thanking me?” ”

“Zhou Rui held Cen Yuyan’s phone. He originally thought that Cen Yuyan would definitely receive likes and comments from the Cen family after the post of the marriage certificate was posted. However, not only did she not receive any messages from the CEN family, but she also did not receive any likes or comments from the Cen family, on the contrary, she did not even receive any likes or comments from other people. ”

This was a little strange.

“Cen Yuyan had many friends in the circle. Unless the CEN family announced that they had broken off their relationship with her, those who were good friends with Cen Yuyan would deliberately distance themselves from Cen Yuyan. ”

“Otherwise, CEN Yuyan would not be so down and out that she would not even receive a likes. ”

Zhou Rui began to suspect if Cen Yuyan had really been abandoned by the CEN family.

If it was true...

“Not only did he not get anything, he even got the title of second-hand goods. ”

Wasn’t this a joke?

Zhou Rui furrowed his brows without leaving a trace.

“But now, Zhou Rui couldn’t show the slightest abnormality. What if the Cen family was still testing him? ”

Wait a little longer.

“Anyway, the wechat moments had already been sent out, so the Cen family must have already known that they were together. ”

The Cen family indeed knew about Cen Yuyan and Zhou Rui getting married.
