Translator: 549690339

“If she only cared about enjoying herself, Li Yiyi would definitely fall out with her. At that time, the loss would outweigh the gain. ”

“Therefore, she would bring Li Yiyi along to enjoy wealth and glory. ”

“Hearing this, Li Yiyi felt a little better. “You and I came from the same village. We grew up together. If I didn’t trust you, I wouldn’t have found you in the first place.” ”

“Since Li Yiyi had found Bai Wei, she was prepared. ”

The information in her hands was enough to destroy Bai Wei in front of Ye Sen.

“Therefore, she wasn’t worried about Bai Wei betraying her. ”

“Bai Wei smiled and held Li Yiyi’s arm. “Sister Yiyi, you haven’t eaten yet, right? Come, I’ll treat you to a meal! Also, Sister Yiyi, I’m no longer Li Lanxiang. You have to call me Weiwei in the future.” ”

Li Lanxiang and the like.

She was really a country bumpkin.

“Alright.”Li Yiyi nodded.

“The two of them chatted as they walked. “Oh right, Sister Yiyi, is Ye Sen living with his sister now?” ”

“Yes.”

“Bai Wei said again, “You just said that Ye Sen was conservative because he was influenced by his sister. What’s the situation with his sister?” ”

“Knowing Yourself and your enemy, you will always be victorious. ”

She had to understand the situation clearly.

“Li Yiyi said, “His sister is a single mother.” ”

“Hearing that, Bai Wei frowned in disgust. “She even brought a burden with her?” ”

“Yes.”

“Bai Wei said in a speechless manner, “I can’t stand living with an outsider after marriage! Ye Sen is already so rich. Can’t he just give some money to get rid of his sister? ! Why did he bring his sister and that burden with him?” ”

“In the future, she would marry ye Sen. ”

Ye Sen’s money was her money.

Why would she use money to support an outsider?

Was it because LV and Gucci didn’t smell good?

“Also, she couldn’t stand the life of looking at an outsider’s eyes. ”

So!

Ye Shu had to get lost!

“Li Yiyi turned to look at Bai Wei, she said very seriously, “Lanxiang, oh no! Weiwei, I have already told you just now. Ye Sen respects his sister very much, and he especially likes his niece. If you want to marry him, you have to please ye Shu! Otherwise, no matter how much ye Sen likes you, he won’t Marry You!”If she accepted ye Sen, she had to accept ye Shu. ”

Li Yiyi had been with Ye Sen for three years.

He often said that elder sister was like a mother.

“Although ye Shu wasn’t elder sister, in Ye Sen’s heart, she was much more important than elder sister. ”

“Bai Wei narrowed her eyes. “Don’t worry, Sister Yiyi. No matter how stupid I am, I know I can’t offend Ye Shu at this time! Do you want to please her? I’m not good at other things, but this is what I’m best at!” ”

She still had to act on the surface.

It wouldn’t be too late for her when everything was in place.

“No matter how good their relationship was, they were afraid of sowing discord. As long as the wind blew by her pillow was good enough, she wasn’t afraid that ye Shu wouldn’t leave! ”

Li Yiyi knew that Bai Wei wasn’t the kind of person who didn’t know her limits.

“After a few words of advice, she didn’t say anything else. ”

...

The next morning.

Yunjing Island.

Six o’clock in the morning.

“Under the influence of his biological clock, ye Zao opened his eyes on time and got up. ”

“The first thing he did when he got up was to go to the window, pull open the curtains, and push open the window. ”

“In an instant, the sea breeze blew in. ”

It was very refreshing.

Even his sleepiness was somewhat awake.

“Looking down at the scenery in front of him, ye Zao suddenly remembered a poem — ” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“I have a house, facing the sea, with flowers blooming in spring. ”

No wonder everyone yearns for this kind of beautiful scenery.

The scenery in front of him was indeed pleasant.

“After standing by the window for a while, ye Zao went to wash up. ”

Because he was preparing to go for a run.

“Therefore, ye Zao changed into a set of sportswear. ”

“His jet-black and beautiful black hair was tied into a bun, revealing the snow-white and beautiful swan neck. ”

Ye Zao put on his white earphones as he walked downstairs. His expression was calm.

“As soon as he walked downstairs, he saw Cen Shaoqing reading the newspaper on the sofa in the living room. ”

His legs were crossed.

His back was straight.

“No matter when or where he was, he was self-disciplined. He stood like a pine tree and sat like a bell. ”

“Although he believed in Buddhism and held a string of Red Buddhist beads in his hands, his body was filled with the aura of an overlord in a high position. ”

“Ye Zao’s eyesight was not bad. Even though she was so far away, she could still see that it was a newspaper printed with French. ”

This was the world newspaper.

She did not expect capitalists to read such a newspaper. Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly and took the initiative to greet CEN Shaoqing. “Good Morning.”

“Good Morning.”Cen Shaoqing looked up slightly. “Why are you awake so early?”

Ye Zao pressed on his earpiece. “I’m going for a run.”
