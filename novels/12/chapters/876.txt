“Old Madam Cen couldn’t bear to see others saying that ye Zao wasn’t good. She frowned and said, “Turn it off. Turn off that annoying bullet screen for me. These people only know how to Blabber all day long.””

“Cen Yuyan smiled and continued, “Grandma, this is just the beginning. Everyone hasn’t seen Zao Zao yet. It’s normal to have misunderstandings about Zao Zao Zao. Let’s take a look again. Who knows, maybe the rest are all Kua Zao Zao’s?””

Praise for ye searing?

How was that possible!

Could it be that everyone was blind?

Cen Yuyan wanted everyone in the Cen family to see the comments praising song Chenyu.

“Hearing this, Old Madam Cen felt that Cen Yuyan’s words were quite right. “Then I’ll bear with it a little longer.””

A faint light flashed in Cen Yuyan’s eyes.

Her gaze turned to the television.

“At this moment, someone knocked on the door of the small courtyard again.”

The program team had edited a lot. The audience only saw Yin Wei rushing over to open the door. They did not know how long ye Zao had been waiting.

The door opened.

A slender figure immediately appeared in front of the screen.

“Black clothes, black pants, and a cap on his head. He looked a little cool.”

[ how come I’ve never seen this Internet celebrity before? ]

[ he seems a little cool! ]

[ he’s pretending to be mysterious! He’s even wearing a cap. Perhaps he’s too ashamed to meet people. ]

[ you’re definitely ugly. ]

“The next second, ye Zao took off the hat on his head and reached out his hand to cause.”

At this second.

The bullet screen exploded.

“[ F * CK, F * CK, F * ck! Why is this internet celebrity so beautiful? ]”

[ Shengshi Beauty! ]

“[ oh my god, this waist is so thin! ]”

[ Sitara YC’s Ye? F * ck! F * ck! Ye! Father Ye! Oh My God! Ye is actually on variety! ]

[ she’s really beautiful. I wonder if the program team opened the filter for her alone. ]

“[ oh my God, I’m a fan of this streamer. ]”

“[ what’s the use of being beautiful? One look and you can tell that she’s one of those pampered young ladies. She’s probably here to experience life. ‘the country’needs work, can she do it? ]”

[ she’s just a vase! She can’t even compare to our sinking fish’s little finger. ]

The next scene was when Song Chenyu took the initiative to greet ye Zao.

“When ye Zao saw that Ye Zao knew song Chenyu, he did not take the initiative to greet him. Instead, he asked Song Chenyu to take the initiative to greet him. This time, the bullet screen exploded.”

[ isn’t he just an internet celebrity? He actually put on airs with Chenyu! ]

“[ Chenyu’s temper is really good. If it were me, I wouldn’t be able to tolerate it. ]”

[ I can’t tolerate it either. ]

[ he doesn’t have any manners at all. That’s enough. This kind of person isn’t worthy of being on television. ]

“When she saw that everyone on the screen was criticizing ye Zao for being rude, the smile on Cen Yuyan’s face deepened.”

This was only the beginning.

Ye Zao would only become more and more humiliated! Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Old madam CEN continued, “Turn off the bullet screen. Quickly turn off the bullet screen! It’s making my head hurt.””

“Cen Yueya was also very unhappy. She continued, “Grandma, if you can bear with it, maybe it’ll be better in a while.””

“Soon, the camera cut to the team.”

“When they saw song Chenyu, song Yiwan, Lu Qi, and Wang Xuancheng being assigned to the same team, everyone heaved a sigh of relief.”

“Fortunately, a certain internet celebrity is not in the same team as Chenyu. Otherwise, the idiom would definitely be dragged down by her”

“[ self-reliance, I Like It! ]”

[ team blue is so lucky to be able to eat the food that Chenyu personally cooked. ]

“[ a certain internet celebrity is really drunk. We, Chenyu, Cook, and you also learn from us, Chenyu. May I ask if Ning’s food is edible? ]”

[ imitating others! Disgusting! ]

“[ my heart aches for Team Red, I wonder what kind of dark cuisine they’re going to eat. ]”

The camera turned and it was time to cut the grass again.

The first thing they saw was the part where song Chenyu accidentally cut his hand. [ my heart aches for Chenyu. ]

“[ Chenyu, go back and rest. ]”

“[ do you really need a band-aid for such a small injury? I’m not saying that song Yiwan’s actions were any slower, but the injury on song Chenyu’s finger would have healed by now. ]”

[ isn’t song Chenyu acting a little too pretentious? ]

“[ add one more, I think so too. ]”

“[ haters are really brainless haters! Don’t tell me that you guys don’t even apply a band-aid on your hands when you’re chopping vegetables? Chenyu only put on a band-aid, and you guys already made him look like this. ]”

“[ ignore those haters, Chenyu is the best Chenyu in my heart! ]”

The camera turned back to the red team.

“At first, everyone thought that ye Zao would be lazy and not cut the grass. They did not expect her to cut the grass faster than Chang Yu and Wei Xingzhi.”

“More importantly, she was very serious when she worked.”

It was also pleasing to the eyes.

[ this internet celebrity is a little different from what I imagined. ]
