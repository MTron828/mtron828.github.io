Chapter 147: 084: Retribution for evil. Lin Ze has arrived in Yunjing! 6

“Mom.”

Just then, there was a knock on the door.

“What’s Wrong?”Feng Qianhua frowned slightly.

Feng Xianxian continued, “Mom, the health soup downstairs is ready. You can send it to Grandma Lin Now.”

Only then did Feng Qianhua remember about the health soup.

Although Lin Ze’s matter was very important, the health soup was more important.

“I’m here.”Feng Qianhua rushed downstairs and carried the health-preserving soup to the Lin family home.

She arrived at the Lin family home.

Old Lady Lin was still waiting for Feng Qianhua at the door.

“Aunt Lin.”

“Qianhua is here.”As long as she saw Feng Qianhua, the gloom on Old Lady Lin’s face would disappear completely.

“It’s cold.”Feng Qianhua carried the health-preserving soup in one hand and helped Old Lady Lin Tuck in her down jacket with the other, “Please Don’t Wait for me outside. Your body is weak to begin with. If anything happens to you because of me, I’ll be a sinner for eternity.”

“Nothing will happen if I just stand there for a while,”said Old Lady Lin with a smile. “My heart will only be at ease when I see you here.”

Aunt Zhang said from the side, “If people who don’t know see you, they’ll think that you and Miss Qianhua are mother and daughter! In other people’s homes, I’m afraid even mother and daughter don’t have such close feelings.”

Aunt Zhang had always been a person who took advantage of the situation.

She knew when to say what she should say.

What she should say was most pleasing to old Mrs. Lin.

Old Mrs. Lin said, “Who says so! In My Eyes, Qianhua is my biological daughter!”

After helping Old Mrs. Lin to sit down in the house and drinking the soup, Feng Qianhua said unintentionally, “Why didn’t I see Ah Ze Today?”

“He went to sea city for a vacation,”old Mrs. Lin answered. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Feng Qianhua looked at Old Mrs. Lin and continued, “I remember that child Ah Ze doesn’t seem to like traveling very much.”

“Ignore him! Ignore him!”Old Mrs. Lin waved her hand.

That child was now old!

She couldn’t control him anymore!

Feng Qianhua didn’t say anything else. A faint light flashed in her eyes.

...

Yun Jing.

After staying in a hotel for one night, Lin Ze set out on his journey to find his mother the next day.

He didn’t know anything.

There were no clues. Standing on the busy street, he suddenly felt a moment of despair.

His gaze fell on a mother and son.

The boy looked about seventeen or eighteen years old, about the same age as him.

“Mom, what are we going to eat tonight?”

“Stir-fry two vegetables and cook a fish,”his mother replied.

“Fish again? I don’t want it!”

“If you don’t want it, then cook it yourself! Eating fish will not only make you grow taller, but it will also make your brain smarter! Look at how stupid you are now!”

”...”

The mother and son walked further and further away.

Lin Ze’s eyes gradually became moist

“Mom!”

He suddenly shouted at the crowd.

“Mom!”

No one responded to him.

“Mom, where are you?”Lin Ze held his head and squatted on the ground, crying loudly.

He didn’t dare to cry when he was in Beijing.

He was afraid that the people around him and old Mrs. Lin would think too much.

Only in this unfamiliar place did he dare to indulge himself like this.

The passers-by looked at him with a puzzled look.

“Little brother, are you alright?”A male voice rang in his ear. At the same time, a hand patted his shoulder.

Lin Ze looked up and saw a delicate and pretty face.

The man was about thirty-five or thirty-six.

He was dressed in a suit and leather shoes.

He looked like a successful person.

Lin Ze wiped his eyes. “I’m fine.”

Ye Sen handed him a piece of paper. “A man should stand tall. Don’t Cry so easily! Here, Wipe Your Face.”

“Thank you, Uncle.”Lin Ze took the piece of paper from Ye Sen.

Ye Sen looked at the youth in front of him who lowered his head to wipe his tears.

He suddenly thought of himself who had been kicked out of the house many years ago.

“Little brother, do you want to go for a drink?”Ye Sen continued.

Lin Ze raised his head and looked at Ye Sen in surprise.

“There’s a restaurant over there. Don’t worry, uncle isn’t a bad person,”ye Sen pointed to the restaurant beside him.

Lin Ze didn’t have the habit of eating with strangers.

But facing this man in front of him, he couldn’t refuse.

It was a very strange feeling.

Ye Sen also saw Lin Ze’s face clearly.

He frowned slightly.

Why did he feel that this child looked a little familiar.

If it wasn’t for his young self-discipline, he would have suspected that this child was his illegitimate child.

Looking at Lin Ze.

Yesen couldn’t help but think of a female novel that he had read before.

“The cold wife runs with the ball.”
