“Chapter 379: 114: emotions are heating up, Ye Shu is in trouble, he’s acting all mighty and domineering! 4”

“The two of them were very engrossed in their conversation, and the driver slowed down his speed with great discernment. ”

...

Mu Yourong had already broken down.

“It had already been fourteen hours since she attended the science and Technology Conference, but the system still had no response. ”

Could it be that the system had really disappeared?

What should she do now?

“Mu Yourong sat on the sofa, her hands clutching her hair. Her facial features were tightly wrinkled, like a patient with a mental disorder. ”

“After a long time, Mu Yourong slowly calmed down. She turned on her computer and prepared to log on to the science and Technology website. ”

The mission the system had given her was to conquer the world of science and technology.

“Perhaps after she opened the science and Technology website, the system would come back on its own. ”

“Mu Yourong opened the login page, entered her password, and clicked login. ”

But the next second.

Her face turned white.

Because the login page showed that her account had been permanently blocked!

What was going on?

Was the system messed up?

How could her account be permanently blocked all of a sudden?

Yes!

It must be messed up!

Mu Yourong turned off her computer and opened the login page again.

“However, the scene before her eyes did not change. ”

Her account had really been permanently blocked!

“In her panic, Mu Yourong opened wechat again and sent a message to Chu Zimo’s little assistant. ”

“Currently, in the technology world, she only knew this little assistant. ”

“The little assistant quickly replied: [ Miss Mu, you did not complete a single task during the technology conference competition. In addition, the number of users who reported you exceeded ten thousand, so the system determined that your previous results were all cheating, so your account was blocked. ] ”

This also meant that there would be no Niu Hulu yr in the science and Technology World in the future.

How could this be!

What right did they have to ban her account!

Mu Yourong sent a message to the little assistant with red eyes.

“However, the other side showed that the little assistant had already blocked her. ”

What was this?

Was everyone pushing the wall?

“B * Tch!”

Mu Yourong was so angry that she directly smashed her phone to the ground.

PA —

The phone screen was smashed into pieces.

Mu Yourong squatted on the ground and cried loudly.

“Ever since she was reborn, Mu Yourong had never experienced such a helpless moment. ”

Everything she had was snatched away by Ye Zao.

The Ye Zao of her previous life was clearly just a trash that she had stepped on.

What was going on now? !

“”System! System, come back quickly!”Mu Yourong called out to the system with her consciousness. ”

“As long as the system came back, she would have a way to kill ye Zhuo. ” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“However, even after Mu Yourong called out for a long time, the system still did not respond. ”

...

“An hour later, the car stopped at the entrance of the hotel. ”

The two got off the car and walked towards the hotel together.

“After entering the elevator and looking at the constantly changing floor numbers, cen Shaoqing asked, “When are you returning to Beijing?” ”

“”Around the day after tomorrow. I have to go to Grandpa Yang’s House Tomorrow,”ye Zhuo replied. ”

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “What Time Tomorrow Morning? I’ll send you there.” ”

“Ye Zhuo answered very naturally, “Around 8:30. I have to go downstairs for breakfast at 7:30.” ”

“Perhaps she didn’t even realize it herself, but she didn’t resist Cen Shaoqing. ”

Nor did she dislike his embrace.

And that unintentional kiss.

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Then let’s Have Breakfast Together Tomorrow Morning?”

“Sure.”

“At 7:30 the next morning, Cen Shaoqing appeared punctually at Ye Zao’s door and knocked. ”

“Soon, the door opened. ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “I didn’t expect you to be so punctual. I was just about to call you.” ”

Cen Shaoqing had always been a punctual person. “Are you done?”

“Almost done.”Ye Zao nodded. “Let’s go down.”

There was a buffet breakfast on the first floor of the hotel.

There were a variety of dishes.

“After breakfast, Cen Shaoqing drove ye Zao to the Yang residence. ”

The Yang residence was not far from the hotel.

They arrived very soon.

“After parking the car, CEN Shaoqing said, “What time will you be back? I’ll pick you up.” ”

“Ye Zao said, “I’ll inform you on wechat.” ”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded.

Ye Zhuo opened the door and got out of the car. “I’ll go in first. Drive slowly on the road.”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

Ye Zhuo had come back to the Yang family manor before.

“Therefore, he was rather familiar with the environment inside. ”

They arrived at the entrance of the Yang family manor.

“When he saw the servant bring ye Zhuo in, grandfather Yang thought that he was hallucinating. “Zhuozhuo!” ”

“Grandfather Yang.”

It wasn’t an illusion?

It was real!

“Grandfather Yang quickly stood up from the sofa. “Zao Zao, when did you come to Beijing? Why didn’t you tell grandfather in advance? Grandfather could have arranged for someone to pick you up at the airport!” ”
