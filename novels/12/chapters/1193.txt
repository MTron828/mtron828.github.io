“Chapter 1194: 256: Si Lui suddenly came to his senses! Face slapping, Grandpa Five’s vest dropped all over the floor! 3”

Translator: 549690339

His mind was buzzing.

“After a long time, he walked out of the teahouse. ”

He was in a daze.

The sky outside was gray.

“Before long, snowflakes started to fall from the sky. ”

Si lui stood on the busy street like this. The disappointment on his face formed a sharp contrast with the bustling street.

“Uncle Fu looked at Si Lui’s back and his face was full of heartache. Just as he was about to hand the umbrella over, a wrinkled hand blocked uncle Fu’s hand. ”

“Master?”Uncle Fu looked at Old Master Jin.

Old Master Jin shook his head. “Now is not the time.”

“Only then did si lui see Zhao Xueyin’s true face clearly. If uncle Fu gave the umbrella to her rashly at this time, according to Si Lui’s suspicious personality, he would definitely misunderstand that everything was planned by them. ”

“At that time, the losses would outweigh the gains. ”

“Therefore, he still had to wait. ”

He had to wait for Si lui to figure it out on his own.

“But...”uncle Fu felt sorry for Si Lui.

“”I know you feel sorry for him, but now is not the time to feel sorry for him.”Old Master Jin continued, “Let that child wake up properly.” ”

“Uncle Fu also knew what Old Master Jin meant, so he could only give up handing the umbrella to Si lui. ”

Old Master Jin turned around and got into the car. “Let’s go back first.”

“Okay.”Uncle Fu nodded and followed Old Master Jin’s footsteps.

They got into the car.

“Old Master Jin made a call. “Hello, fifth master. Thank you.” ”

A deep voice came from the other side. “Has the matter been settled?”

“Old Master Jin continued, “It has already started to show results, but I still need fifth master to lend assistant LIN to me for a few more days.” ”

“When Old Master Jin asked Cen Shaoqing for help, Cen Shaoqing did not want to appear personally. Hence, Ye Zhuo suggested that assistant Lin appear. ”

“Old Master Jin thought that this method would not work. After all, it was Lin Chaoyang who was negotiating with Zhao Xueyin from the beginning to the end. Cen Shaoqing did not even show his face. ”

He did not expect that this method would be so effective!

“Sure.”.

“Old Master Jin continued, “I’ll have to trouble you to say thank you to miss ye for me.”If it wasn’t for Ye Zhuo’s help, he would still be like a headless chicken. ”

He had to admit that ye Zhuo was really amazing!

“After hanging up, Old Master Jin looked up at the driver. “Let’s go to the cemetery.” ”

“Okay.”The driver nodded.

“Soon, the car stopped at the entrance of the cemetery. ”

Grandpa Jin opened the door and got out.

Uncle Fu also got out of the car.

“Don’t follow me.”

Uncle Fu handed the umbrella to Grandpa Jin. “Take the umbrella.”

Grandpa Jin took the umbrella and walked into the cemetery.

Not many people came to the cemetery at this time of year.

The entire cemetery looked empty and desolate.

It was also a little cold.

Old Master Jin held an umbrella and walked forward.

A row of footprints were left on the vast snowy ground.

“After walking for about ten minutes, old master Jin stopped in front of a tombstone. ”

There was a photo of a young woman on the tombstone.

The photo was very old.

It had the feel of a harbor-style beauty from the 1970s and 1980s.

“Looking at the woman in the photo, Old Master Jin’s eyes were slightly red. After a while, he slowly said, “Alan, I’m here to see you.” ”

The only response he got was the whistling cold wind and the rustling snow.

“”Alan, I’m sorry...” ”

“”That child, ruyu, looks so much like me. You must have felt worse than me back then, right?” ”

“Grandfather Jin stood in front of the tombstone for a very, very long time. ”

He only turned around and left when the umbrella was covered with a thick layer of snow.

The snow was getting heavier.

Si lui did not know how he returned to the Shunxi Financial Group.

He could not believe that what he had just experienced was real.

“”Big Brother Si.”At this moment, Zhao Xueyin’s voice came from behind. ”

Si lui looked back.

Zhao Xueyin was still the same as usual. The smile on her face was always so gentle.

“Looking at that face, Si Lui’s face was full of self-mockery. ”

“Seeing that lawyer Si’s expression was not right, Zhao Xueyin frowned slightly. “Big Brother Si, what’s wrong with you?” ”

“Nothing.”Lawyer si retracted his gaze. “I’m just a little tired.”

“Zhao Xueyin said very concernedly, “Big Brother Si, have you been too tired recently?” ”

“At this moment, lawyer Si had almost forgotten about the scene that had happened in the teahouse. ”

He did not understand.

Why Could Zhao Xueyin Act so well.

“From the beginning to the end, they were two completely different people. ” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Or was Zhao Xueyin just acting in the teahouse?

“If what Zhao Xueyin said in the teahouse was true, she would definitely find a way to fire her. ”

“However, Zhao Xueyin didn’t seem to have any intention of firing him. ”
