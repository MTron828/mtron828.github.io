“Although it was the break time, Yu Zifei still had to deal with documents every day and had a video call with his assistant. ”

“”I’ll go ask your mother,”father Yu said. ”

“Okay.”

Father Yu returned to the room and told Tian Zhifang the good news.

“Hearing this, Tian Zhifang said in surprise, “Really? Zifei really agreed?”One had to know that Tian Zhifang had also mentioned this matter to Yu Zifei before, but Yu Zifei had rejected it! ”

“”Of course it’s true,”father Yu said. “Zifei just asked when the blind date will be arranged. He needs to make some preparations.” ”

“”Tomorrow! Tomorrow morning at 10:00 a.m. , we’ll meet at Peninsula Coffee on Lin Chang Road.” ”

“”Okay.”Father Yu was also very concerned about this matter. He continued, “I’ll go and inform Zifei now.” ”

On the other side.

Cen’s base.

“After some research, Ye Zhuo finally contacted the assistant of nine provinces. ” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“However, the assistant didn’t immediately reply to Ye Zao. ”

He ziteng trotted to Cen Shaoqing’s office.

“”Fifth brother, you’re looking for me.” ”

“Hearing he ziteng’s voice, Cen Shaoqing placed the Buddha bead on the table. “Has there been any movement on nine provinces’account recently?” ”

“What movement are you referring to?”He ziteng asked.

Nine provinces was the number one account on the PL rankings. Who knew how many messages they would receive every day!

“Cen Shaoqing said, “Log into the account and I’ll take a look.” ”

He ziteng was a little speechless.

Could it be that Cen Shaoqing had called him all the way here just to let him log into nine provinces account?

“”Fifth brother, why didn’t you log in yourself?”He ziteng asked. ”

“He ziteng twirled the Buddhist beads and continued, “I forgot the password.” ”

“If he had remembered the password, Cen Shaoqing wouldn’t have called he ziteng all the way here. ”

Forget the password?

He ziteng’s eyes were filled with disbelief.

That was nine provinces account!

Why would cen Shaoqing make it sound so natural to forget the password?

“”Fifth brother, you’re not joking with me, right?” ”

Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly. “Why would I joke with You?”

“After saying that, CEN Shaoqing turned the computer screen to he ziteng. “Hurry up and log in to the account.” ”

He ziteng walked over and entered the password.

“Soon, the account was logged in. ”

“Cen Shaoqing recognized ye Zhuo’s account at a glance and continued, “Tell her to meet you at the Imperial Court cafe at 11:30 Tomorrow Morning.” ”

He ziteng was stunned again.

Meet!

Cen Shaoqing actually wanted to meet the person who asked for help.

What was going on?

Did the sun rise from the West?

“One had to know that before this, Cen Shaoqing did not care about these people who were asking for help at all. ”

But today...

This was too abnormal!

“”Fifth brother, are you sure you want to meet?”He ziteng asked. ”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded.

“He ziteng said with some curiosity, “Fifth brother, do you know this person? Is it a man or a woman? Does fifth sister-in-law know?” ”

“This has nothing to do with you.”Cen Shaoqing twirled the prayer beads.

He Ziteng didn’t ask further.

He knew Cen Shaoqing’s temper.

But he ziteng was still a little curious.

Who was this person?

He was actually worthy of Cen Shaoqing meeting him personally.

Over here.

Ye Zhuo finished his last experiment.

“At this moment, his phone rang. ”

Ye Zhuo took out his phone. It was a reply from nine provinces.

“The other party replied: [ tomorrow at 11:30 am, see you at the Imperial Court Cafe. ] ”

Ye Zhuo also immediately replied: [ Okay. ]

He would return at night.

“Sitting in the car, Ye Zhuo turned to look at Cen Shaoqing. “I have an appointment with nine provinces.” ”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “I know.”

“Seeing his calm expression, ye Zhuo was a little speechless. “You’re not going to say that you’re nine provinces again, are you?” ”

“”If you know me, then you’re my wife.”Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted slightly, and his tone was low. ”

Ye Zhuo chuckled. “Who’s your wife? Don’t be so narcissistic!”

“”You’re going to become my wife sooner or later anyway,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly. “What if you become someone else’s?”

“Who would dare?”Cen Shaoqing glanced at her.

“Ye Zhuo chuckled and then turned on his phone. He looked at the nearby food street and said, “There seems to be a new online tofu shop here. It eats freshly ground tofu. Let’s go and take a look.” ”

“Ye Zao liked to eat bean products, such as dried beans, tofu, and tofu skins. ”

“Seeing that there were people eating freshly ground tofu nearby, she naturally couldn’t miss it! ”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Where is the address?”

“”221 Siyuan Road,”ye Zao said. ”

Cen Shaoqing slowly turned around and drove toward Siyuan Road.

“No matter what kind of food it was, as long as the word ‘online celebrity’was mentioned, it would become overcrowded. ”
