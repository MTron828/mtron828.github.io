“”Classmate?”Old Mrs. Cen narrowed her eyes. “It’s a girl, right?””

“”It’s a boy,”Lin ze continued, “I know that boy, Zhuozhuo.””

“Who is it?”Ye Zhuo was also a little curious.

“Buttface.”

“Hearing this, Ye Zhuo said in surprise, “I didn’t expect brother Buttface to be so caring.”Usually, girls raised more cute and delicious creatures like rabbits.”

“Hearing that it wasn’t a girl, Old Mrs. Cen was a little disappointed. She patted Lin Ze’s shoulder and said, “Ah Ze, you’re not young anymore. You can find one.””

“No Rush.”

“Old Mrs. Cen turned to look at Lin ze and said, “AH ze, do you have a little girl that you have a crush on? You can tell Grandma. Grandma will help you. One is worth two. I promise to help you get your little wife back!””

“”No.”Lin Ze picked up the rabbit cage and continued, “Grandma Cen, I’ll go back to my room first.””

“Looking at Lin Ze’s back, old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “Ah Ze, you’re too shy! You’re so thin-skinned. How are you going to find a girlfriend in the future!””

“After saying that, old Mrs. Cen turned to look at Ye Zao. “Oh Right, Zao Zao, the fourth girl will bring her boyfriend back tomorrow. You should go over and give her a big hand.””

“Tomorrow?”

“”Yes.”Old Mrs. Cen nodded. “The fourth girl isn’t young anymore. If the man has a good character, I want to settle their matters as soon as possible so that I can settle my worries as soon as possible.””

“When one was old, their greatest hope was to see their children and grandchildren get married and start their own businesses.”

“Now that Cen Shaoqing had found his best partner, Cen Yuyan was the only one left.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Alright, since it’s fourth sister’s lifetime event, I definitely can’t miss it.””

“In the blink of an eye, the next day arrived.”

“Early in the morning, Zhou Rui drove to Cen Yuyan’s residence.”

“CEN Yuyan also woke up early. After all, today was the day she brought Zhou Rui home to meet her parents, “Zhou Rui, there are more people in our family. I have three older sisters and a younger brother. Today is the first time I’m bringing you home. My older sister and my three brother-in-law will definitely come back. My three brother-in-law’s family background is very good, but compared to them, you’re not bad either, so you don’t have to be nervous.””

Zhou Rui nodded. “Then is your brother at home today?”

“My older sister is bringing her brother-in-law back. How can he not be at home?”Cen Yuyan said.

Brother-in-law.

He was about to become CEN fifth master’s brother-in-law.

A sense of superiority arose spontaneously.

“Zhou Rui couldn’t help but raise the corners of his mouth. “Oh right, I’ve even prepared gifts for Auntie and Grandma. They’re in the backseat. Can you take a look?””

“Cen Yuyan smiled and said, “There’s no need to look. I’ve finally brought them a son-in-law. Even if you give them a fart, they’ll still think it’s fragrant!””

“With that said, Zhou Rui became even more excited.”

A rich son-in-law.

He was simply the Cen family’s rich son-in-law.

The car soon stopped at the entrance of the Cen family’s manor.

“Because it was an unfamiliar license plate, the security personnel had to conduct a routine check.”

“Zhou Rui looked at the magnificent gate of the manor, his heart racing.”

“Ever since he was born, he had never dreamed that one day he would be able to drive freely in and out of such a wealthy area.”

“The Cen Manor was located in the center of the capital city, where every inch of land was extremely valuable. It occupied an area of more than 500 acres.”

“The deeper the car drove, the more luxurious the buildings became. Zhou Rui even saw two alpacas and peacocks strolling by the artificial lake, as well as a limited edition luxury car that could be seen everywhere.”

“Zhou Rui originally thought that the villa he bought was already luxurious enough, but compared to this place, it was nothing.”

“Thinking that he was about to become the owner of this manor and could live here forever, Zhou Rui became elated again.”

“”Turn ahead, and then the next intersection is our home.””

“Okay.”Zhou Rui suppressed his excitement.

“Soon, the car stopped in the CEN family’s courtyard.”

“Apart from the car, there was also a helicopter parked in the courtyard.”

“Zhou Rui swallowed his saliva and said in a low voice, “Yuyan, this helicopter is also yours?””

“”Yes, my brother bought it, but he rarely drives it and has been idle for a long time.””

“At this moment, a butler in a suit walked over. “Fourth miss, Old Madam and Madam are already waiting in the living room.””

“”Okay.”CEN Yuyan continued, “Oh right, Uncle Sun, let me introduce you to my boyfriend, Zhou Rui. Zhou Rui, this is our butler, Uncle Sun!””

Uncle Sun nodded at Zhou Rui. “Mr. Zhou.”

“Uncle Sun.”

“When Uncle Sun walked over, Zhou Rui thought that he was Cen Yuyan’s brother-in-law. He didn’t expect that he was just a butler.”
