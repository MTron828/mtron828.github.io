“Chapter 1540: No. 323: open the masochistic trash, the black-bellied CEN fifth master! No. 4”

“Buttface smiled and asked, “If your eldest miss an can come, why can’t we?” ”

“Hearing this, Zhang Qingqing was a little unhappy. ”

She knew what an Lizi meant.

An Lizi just didn’t think that she was worthy of Lin Ze.

HMPH.

What a B * TCH.

“She said that she did not look down on her, but in her heart, she never looked her in the eye. ”

“As long as an Lizi really looked up to her, she would not treat her like this! ”

Just wait and see.

“If she married Lin Ze, she would be the young mistress of the Lin family. If she gave birth to a son for Lin Ze, no one would be able to shake her position. She wanted to see how long an Lizi would be able to laugh! ”

Xia Xiaoman and Lin Qingxuan had been married for more than a year and had yet to have any children. There was an 80% chance that Xia Xiaoman was unable to give birth!

“If she could give birth, there was no need to wait until now! ”

Just wait.

An old woman and a burden would be chased out by Lin Qingxuan sooner or later.

“Thinking of this, Zhang Qingqing felt much better. ”

“An Lizi looked at Buttface and smiled. “I can come! Of course I can come! I’m just a little curious! Oh right, did Ah Ze come too?” ” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“”Brother Ze is at the back,”dog two said. ”

Lin Ze really came.

“Originally, Lin Ze wasn’t prepared to come, so he couldn’t withstand dog two’s prayers. ”

“Dog Two really liked an Lizi, so of course he had to perform well. Lin Ze was an Lizi’s cousin. If Lin Ze didn’t come, it would be more or less inappropriate for the three of them to come. ”

An Lizi then introduced her roommates to the four of them.

Zhang Qingqing stood at the side.

“She didn’t notice it just now, but now she did. ”

“Of the three roommates of an Lizi, Hua Xian was the most beautiful. ”

“He had a pair of delicate almond-shaped eyes and a standard oval face. Although he didn’t wear makeup, it was still eye-catching. ”

“However, although Hua Xian was pretty good-looking, his clothes were very ordinary. ”

One look and you could tell that he was one of those cheap taobao goods!

“Inexplicably, Zhang Qingqing disliked Hua Xian very much. Hua Xian was also her only opponent. Girls from poor families like Hua Xian were mostly gold diggers who wanted to climb up the ladder. ”

Who was the biggest ladder tonight?

Of course it was Lin Ze!

What if Hua Xian tried to snatch Lin ze away from her?

“Thinking of this, Zhang Qingqing looked at Hua Xian with eyes full of hostility. ”

Hua Xian seemed to feel Zhang Qingqing’s gaze and raised his eyelids to look at Zhang Qingqing. Zhang Qingqing immediately averted her gaze.

“”Everyone, let’s add each other on wechat!”Fat Tiger held his phone and looked at an Lizi. “Sister Lizi, I’ve created a group. You can pull all your roommates in.” ”

“Okay.”An Lizi nodded and went to the group to pull people in.

“After pulling all her roommates in, fat tiger continued, “Don’t disband this group. In the future, we can play games together. We can even chat when there’s nothing to do.” ”

“Okay.”

“Zhang Qingqing took out her phone and opened wechat. She thought that an Lizi had also pulled her into the group, but to her surprise, it didn’t happen at all. ”

“In an Lizi’s heart, what exactly was she? ”

Zhang Qingqing held back the anger in her heart.

“At this time, the staff of the club came in and looked at an Lizi. “Miss an, may I ask if the drinks are ready now?” ”

“Yes.”An Lizi nodded.

“Not long after, the drinks were served. ”

Zhang Qingqing poured herself a glass of beer and raised her glass. “Thank you all for taking the time to celebrate my birthday in your busy schedule. Here’s a toast! Let’s Get Drunk Tonight!”

“With that, she drank the beer in her glass in one gulp. ”

“Before coming to the club, Zhang Qingqing had already checked. As long as she was pregnant and didn’t drink too much for a long time, it wouldn’t be a problem for her to drink a little occasionally. ”

She hoped that the child in her stomach would be a little stronger.

“After all, whether or not she could succeed tonight would all depend on this glass of beer! ”

“Right. Let’s Get Drunk!”Buttface and the others raised their glasses.

“Hua Xian, Rong Yin, and Ouyang Qian weren’t shy either. The three of them quickly got together, singing and chatting in the private room, playing werewolf slayer. They were very high. ”

It was soon 12 o’clock in the morning.

“Looking at the people in the private room, Zhang Qingqing narrowed her eyes. Lin Ze wasn’t on the sofa. He must have gone to the bathroom. ”

Now!

“She couldn’t delay any longer. If she did, it would be dawn soon. ”

Zhang Qingqing stood up and walked to the other end of the coffee table. She made herself a cocktail and then put a white pill in Lin Ze’s Cup with lightning speed.
