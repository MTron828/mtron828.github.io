This was creating a common language.

“Zhou Rui nodded. “Don’t worry, I know what to do.””

Song Chenyu raised her goblet to Zhou Rui. “I wish you all the best.”

“Thinking that she would be able to get rid of Zhou Rui’s threat soon, song Chenyu felt extremely comfortable.”

“Thank you.”Zhou Rui also raised his goblet. “Let’s have a good cooperation.”

Three days later.

The banquet began.

Cen Yuyan went to attend on time.

“During the process of attending the banquet, she was attracted by a tall figure.”

“The other party looked to be about twenty-one or twenty-two years old. His facial features were handsome, and when he smiled, there was a warm light in his eyes.”

It made people unconsciously look at him.

A Little Puppy.

“Cen Yuyan had grown up, so what kind of man had she not seen before?”

“She had a boyfriend who was a little puppy like this. Later on, they got tired of being together and broke up.”

“The reason why this little boy was able to attract Cen Yuyan was because from the start of the banquet until now, he had never looked her in the eye once.”

Even if others came over with wine glasses and called her cen fourth miss.

“Over the years, Cen Yuyan was used to being flattered and had long been tired of such things.”

“When she suddenly saw a person who couldn’t be bothered with her, CEN Yuyan’s gaze was immediately attracted to him.”

“What surprised Cen Yuyan the most was that this little boy had always kept himself clean and kept a distance from the opposite sex. Even if a girl specifically came to pick him up, he would politely reject her.”

This man.

Seemed to be more outstanding than Lu Xiu.

Cen Yuyan drank a mouthful of red wine and calmly retracted her gaze.

“Zhou Rui knew that Cen Yuyan was paying attention to him, and there was a smug look in his eyes.”

Song Chenyu really did not lie to him.

“Three hours later, the banquet ended.”

It had started to rain in the sky.

Cen Yuyan walked out of the door and subconsciously placed her bag on her head.

“At this moment, an umbrella was placed above her head. “Use my umbrella.””

It was a very warm tone.

Cen Yuyan looked up and saw a familiar face. She subconsciously took the umbrella. “Th-thank you.”

“”You’re welcome.”After saying that, Zhou Rui walked into the rain.”

“Cen Yuyan asked, “Aren’t you going to use an umbrella?””

“My driver is waiting for me in front.”

Cen Yuyan jogged over and chased after him. “What’s Your Name? Can you give me your contact information? I’ll get someone to give you the umbrella tomorrow.”

“”No need, it’s just an umbrella.””

“Before Cen Yuyan could react, the man’s figure had already disappeared in the rain.”

Cen Yuyan looked at the umbrella in her hand. The handle of the umbrella still seemed to carry the warmth of the man’s palm. She originally thought that he was using the umbrella to hit on her and ask for her contact information. She didn’t expect that he was just simply lending her an umbrella.

She was thinking too much.

“The corners of Cen Yuyan’s mouth curled up slightly, and her originally gloomy heart suddenly became clear.”

“All the way back to Song Chenyu’s residence, Cen Yuyan’s face was filled with a smile.”

“Seeing her like this, song chenyu smiled and teased, “Yuyan, are you lucky?””

“Cen Yuyan shook her head. “No, I just suddenly realized that there are many men in this world who are better than Lu Xiu. There’s no need for me to hang myself on a tree.””

“A faint light flashed across song Chenyu’s eyes as he said happily, “Yuyan, it’s great that you can think like that. I’ve always been worried that you won’t be able to pass this test.””

“There’s nothing to be worried about.”Cen Yuyan took off her high heels. “Isn’t it just a man? Don’t tell me that I can’t live without him? I don’t believe that Ye Zhuo can make all the men in the world fall in love with her!” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “That’s hard to say. After all, Miss Ye is really outstanding. Otherwise, Lu Xiu wouldn’t have fallen in love with Miss Ye so badly. In order to protect Miss Ye, he didn’t even dare to admit who he liked.””

Cen Yuyan’s eyes flashed with a gloomy light.

Just wait.

A fickle woman like ye Zao would one day receive retribution.

“Song Chenyu walked over and patted Cen Yuyan on the shoulder. “Okay, okay, Yuyan, I was just joking with you!””

...

On the other side.

“Ye Zao was sitting in front of his computer and broadcasting live. After a game of chess, Ye Zao received a PK invitation.”

The invitee.

Little Yu’er.

“Looking at her profile picture, she was a great beauty.”

[ little Yu’er? Isn’t she the new chess streamer? ]

“[ ye, quickly agree! ]”

[ I heard that this little Yu’er is quite amazing. ]

[ I went to watch her live stream a few days ago. Her chess style is indeed not bad. ]

“[ F * ck, is the goddess going to have a competition with the goddess? ]”

“Seeing that everyone was quite excited, Ye Zhuo clicked to agree to the invitation.”
