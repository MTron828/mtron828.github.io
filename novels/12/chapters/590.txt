“Because compared to a girl who needed to live under the protection of a man, she preferred a girl who was strong!”

What kind of ability was it to rely on a man?

“Husband and wife?”Cen Yuyan’s face was filled with disdain. “My fifth brother will never marry her!”

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “Who can say for sure about Fate!””

They had not reached the end yet. Who knew who Cen Shaoqing would marry in the end?

...

Time passed very quickly.

“In the blink of an eye, it was the double ninth festival.”

The double ninth festival was also known as autumn treading.

The Lin family attached great importance to this festival and had begun to prepare early.

“On the double ninth festival, the CEN family’s eldest, second, and third brothers brought their families back to Beijing.”

“In the evening, everyone gathered in Old Lady Lin’s Courtyard to hold a family banquet.”

“Lin Qingfan, the eldest son of the Lin family, and Wu Mei had three sons and one grandson.”

“Lin Qingyun, the second son, and Zhang Zhenzhen had four sons and three grandchildren.”

“Lin Qingyang, the third son, and Yang Wenyin had three sons in total. The youngest son had yet to start a family and had a grandson.”

“Lin Qingxuan, the fourth son, had just divorced and was currently alone.”

“The fifth son, Lin Jincheng, and Ye Shu had a son and a daughter.”

“Including Old Mrs. Lin, there were a total of 31 members of the Lin family. All of them had arrived tonight.”

“Wu Mei, Zhang Zhenzhen, and Yang Wenyin, the three sisters-in-law, had just arrived at the Lin Manor when they came to the east courtyard to chat with Ye Shu.”

The four sisters-in-law got along very well.

“Ye Shu also prepared gifts for her nephews, nephews, and grandsons.”

“As the cousins had something to do at the last family recognition banquet, Lin Jincheng took the opportunity to bring ye Zao to recognize his brothers and sisters-in-law.”

“There were a total of ten cousins and nine sisters-in-law, from first cousin to tenth cousin, first cousin sister-in-law to ninth cousin sister-in-law.”

Ye Zao was a little dizzy from being recognized.

“As the youngest sister in the family, Ye Zao also received gifts.”

“”Little twelve, this is the greeting gift that eldest brother and eldest sister-in-law prepared for you.””

“”Little Twelve, you’ve already accepted Big Brother and sister-in-law’s things. You Can’t not accept second brother and sister-in-law’s things!””

“”And US. Little Twelve, you can’t be biased against one another!””

“Little twelve...”

“Because ye Zhuo was the youngest in the family, he was given the nickname Little Twelve.”

“Ye Zhuo was also beautiful. In addition, the Lin family hadn’t gotten a girl for so many years, so ye Zhuo naturally became the family’s favorite.”

“Seeing her grandchildren and granddaughter-in-law all surrounding ye Zao, Old Lady Lin was a little unhappy.”

These children were really too insensible.

“They had brought gifts for ye Zao, but there was no place for her as a grandmother.”

Besides.

“It was not like they did not know that she did not like ye Zao. Old Lady Lin had originally wanted to be nice to Ye Shu and her daughter, but she did not expect these people to actually dare to go against her.”

“Out of sight, out of mind. Old Lady Lin turned to look at Aunt Zhang. “When Will Qianhua and Xianxian arrive?””

Feng Qianhua and Feng Xianxian would always attend the double ninth festival every year.

This year was no exception.

“Aunt Zhang said, “When I called Miss Qianhua just now, they were already in the car. They should be arriving soon.””

Old Mrs. Lin nodded. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“When Feng Qianhua and Feng Xianxian arrived, they happened to bump into a few brothers and sisters-in-law giving gifts to Ye Zao.”

Feng Xianxian’s eyes flashed with unwillingness.

“In the past, she was the most popular one in the Lin family. Everyone revolved around her. She did not expect that this year, it would be ye Zao!”

Why was Ye Zao So Shameless?

Snatching things from her hands time and time again!

Feng Qianqian bit her lip.

“Watch Your Manners.”Feng Qianhua turned to look at Feng Qianqian.

Feng Qianqian immediately smiled and walked in front of Old Lady Lin. “Grandma!”

“”Qianqian is here!”Old Lady Lin held Feng Qianqian’s hand. “Qianqian, remember to sit beside me later.””

Not everyone had the right to sit beside her.

A wild girl like ye Zhuo did not have the right!

“Feng Xianxian nodded. “Thank you, Grandmother.””

“Soon, the family banquet began. The nine sisters-in-law held onto ye Zhuo and all of them wanted him to sit beside them.”

The five nephews also held onto ye Zhuo’s leg and did not let go. “We want to sit with aunt.”

“In the end, Ye Zao had no choice but to sit in the middle of the children.”

“The oldest of the five children was five years old, and the youngest was three years old. All of them were extremely obedient. They fought to get food for ye Zao. “Auntie wants to Eat This!””

“Auntie likes mine!”

“Nonsense! Auntie clearly likes the food I gave her!”

“...”

“Seeing that the five children were about to fight, ye Zao smiled and said, “Each of you gave it to Auntie. Auntie likes it very much.””

Only then were the five little ones satisfied.

“Feng Xianxian added a pearl ball to Old Lady Lin, “Grandma, recently, our school has a science and technology competition. The person who created this award is Dr. YC. He is a famous figure in the science and technology world. I got third place in this science and technology competition. There is an award ceremony on Saturday afternoon. I would like to invite you to participate.””

“When she said this, the dining table fell silent for a moment.”

Beijing university was full of talents. To be able to get third place in the science and technology competition and be recognized by Dr. YC was really amazing.

Old Mrs. Lin was stunned. “Really?”

Feng Xianxian nodded.

“”Okay, okay, okay! When the time comes, not only grandma will go, but our whole family will cheer for you!”After saying that, old Mrs. Lin looked at Lin Ze and ye Zao, her eyes full of scrutiny. “The two of you are also from Beijing University. Which Place did you get?””

Feng Xianxian smiled proudly.

“As far as she knew, ye Zao did not participate in the competition at all.”

Getting third place in the science and technology competition was equivalent to getting the key to the world of science and technology. Could Ye Zao do it?

What qualifications did ye Zao have to compete with her?
