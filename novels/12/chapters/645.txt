“At this moment, ye Zao continued, “Assistant MA, Please Help Master Yu Sit Up.” ”

“At this moment, assistant Ma could only cooperate with Ye Zao and help Master Yu up. ”

Ye Zao then took out the fifth silver needle and pierced it directly into all of Master Yu’s acupuncture points.

The silver needle gradually turned black at a speed visible to the naked eye!

“Meanwhile, master Yu’s face was slowly turning white, and even his lips had turned paper-colored. ”

Assistant Ma’s expression changed. “What’s going on?”

Ye Zhuo’s brows remained unchanged. “This is the poison that has accumulated in master Yu’s body. There’s no need to worry. It’ll be fine once the poison is expelled from his body.”

Feng Xianxian’s eyes were filled with disdain.

“Looking at Master Yu, it was obvious that he was about to die. ”

Ye Zao could actually say that it was a detoxification.

Did he really think that everyone else was an idiot?

Assistant MA also felt that something was wrong because there were no signs of life on Master Yu’s body. “Miss Lin! Are you sure that this is a detoxification?”

“”Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. Then, he took out a small porcelain jar from the medicine box at the side. He poured out a small black pill from the porcelain jar. Then, he opened Master Yu’s mouth and placed the prescription into Master Yu’s mouth. ” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“What kind of medicine is this? Can it be eaten?”Assistant MA was stunned again.

“Qingyou Pill. It can dispel cold air and detoxify poison.”Ye Zhuo took out a note from the medicine box and handed it to assistant MA. “Don’t worry. It’s not some third-rate medicine.”

Assistant MA took the note and frowned slightly. He did not expect this qingyou pill to have so many effects.

“However, not only did it not have any effect, master Yu’s condition was getting worse! ”

His pale lips had turned black.

“Feng Xianxian squatted down and checked master Yu’s breath. Her face turned pale and she sat on the ground in shock. “Master, Master Yu seems to be out of breath...” ”

“What?”

Assistant MA was also shocked and immediately reached out to check master Yu’s breath.

“He was really, really out of breath! ”

Lin Jincheng and Lin Qingxuan were also slightly stunned.

“Seeing this scene, Old Lady Lin immediately cried out, “Oh my God! What sin has our Lin family committed? !” ”

Feng Qianqian looked at Master Yu who was already out of breath and her eyes were filled with pride.

It’s over!

“This time, Ye Zao was really done for! ”

Feng Qianqian could already imagine what kind of Asura battlefield she would have to face ye Zao in the future.

She had waited for so long.

She had finally waited for ye Zao’s retribution!

“If it wasn’t for the wrong occasion, Feng Qianqian almost wanted to laugh out loud. ”

“Assistant Ma looked at Lin Qingxuan and Lin Jincheng. “Mr. Lin Si, Mr. Lin Wu! You guys just said that you would take responsibility. Now that Master Yu has passed away, how do you plan to take responsibility?” ”

“Lin Jincheng walked out. “I, Lin, have always kept my word! Since I’ve said that I will take responsibility, I will definitely take responsibility!” ”

“And me!”Lin Qingxuan also walked out.

Old Madam Lin almost fainted.

“Lin Jincheng and Lin Qingxuan were the pillars of the family. If anything happened to them, how could the Lin family survive? ”

“”This matter has nothing to do with Qingxuan and Jincheng! Assistant MA, if you want to find her, look for this wild girl. If she wasn’t arrogant, nothing would have happened to Jingshan!” ”

“Who told you that something happened to Master Yu?”Ye Zao unhurriedly put away the silver needles on Master Yu’s acupuncture points.

“Feng Xianxian raised her head to look at Ye Zao. “Sister Ye Zao, don’t be stubborn at a time like this!” ”

She had already breathed her last. Could it be that ye Zao could bring Master Yu Back to life?

What a joke!

She didn’t know where she got her confidence from!

Ye Zao did not explain. He removed the last needle from Master Yu’s body and pressed it on the Fengchi acupoint.

“Urgh!”

“Master Yu, who had been lying on the ground with his eyes closed, suddenly sat up and vomited a mouthful of blood. ”

It was different from normal people’s blood.

The blood that master Yu vomited was black.

Ye Zao put the acupuncture bag into the medical kit and looked up at Master Yu. “How do you feel now?”

“”Good! Very good!”Master Yu felt very comfortable, it was as if a heavy burden had been lifted from his shoulders. He continued, “Little girl! Thank you! If you had not disregarded the objections of others and treated me, I’m afraid that I would have really passed away!” ”

Master Yu’s illness was a serious illness.

“Even the doctor told him that he did not have much time left, which was why he was in a hurry to accept a closed-door disciple. ”

“The moment he passed out, his whole body was wooden, even though there was a possibility of death. ”
