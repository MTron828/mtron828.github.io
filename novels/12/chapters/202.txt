“Chapter 203: 090: Beat the crap out of me, brother Ze’s style! 2”

Translator: 549690339

“Ye Zao’s eyes lit up when he saw the red wild raspberries. “Brother Five, wait for me here for a moment.” ”

“Although Cen Shaoqing was a little confused, he still nodded slightly and waited for ye Zao. ”

“Ye Zao picked two large leaves and wove them into a small pocket. He placed the raspberries inside and soon, he picked a pocket full of them. ”

“Looking at these red raspberries, Ye Zao was filled with a sense of accomplishment. He pinched a raspberry and tasted it. ”

It was much better than what he had imagined.

It was sweet.

It was slightly sour.

It was the taste of his memories.

“In an instant, he returned to the past. ”

“”Fifth brother, do you want to try it?”Ye Zao handed the raspberries to Cen Shaoqing. ”

Cen Shaoqing hesitated.

He had always been a neat freak.

“Not only had the fruit not been washed, it also looked a little strange... ”

“There was everything in the mountain, and he didn’t know if it had been crawled by snakes. ”

Could it really be eaten?

“However, Cen Shaoqing couldn’t refuse ye Zhuo in the end. His slender jade-like fingers picked up a raspberry and tried hard to forget his neat freak. He put it into his mouth, chewed it a few times, and quickly swallowed it. ”

“”If you like it, I’ll give you all of these.”Seeing Cen Shaoqing eat so quickly, ye Zao handed the raspberry in his hand and the bag of leaves to Cen Shaoqing. ”

“It was obvious that this person had never eaten such delicious food. Otherwise, how could he swallow it so quickly! ”

Cen Shaoqing was stunned. “You’re not eating?”

“Ye Zao continued, “I see a forest of wild tea ahead. I’ll go check if there are tea bubbles later.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing felt that the wild raspberries in his hand were heavy. He then asked, “What’s Tea?” ”

Ye Zhuo looked at Cen Shaoqing in surprise. “You don’t even know about tea?”

Cen Shaoqing shook his head.

He really didn’t know.

This was the first time he had seen this wild raspberry.

“Before this, no one had ever dared to make him eat such strange things. ”

“Ye Zao explained, “The tea bubble is a kind of mutated camellia fruit on the camellia oleifera tree. It tastes very good. You’ll know it after you taste it.” ”

“OH.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

The two walked into the wild tea forest.

“There were a lot of tea bubbles at this time of the year. Not long after, ye Zao found the tea bubble on a tea tree. “Brother Five, come and take a look. This is the tea bubble.” ”

The shape of the tea brewing looked very strange.

It looked like a leaf.

“However, it was much thicker than a normal leaf. It was also a little red, as if it had been injected with hormones. ”

Cen Shaoqing frowned without leaving a trace. “Can this be eaten?”was there really no bacteria? Was there really no need to disinfect it?

“”It can be eaten.”As he spoke, ye Zao took off the tea brewing and ate it in one bite. ”

“It was crisp, sweet, and had a hint of tea fragrance. ”

“You want to try it too?”Ye Zhuo took a piece of tea bubble and handed it to Cen Shaoqing.

“Cen Shaoqing really wanted to refuse, but his hand still took it very honestly and put it into his mouth. ”

“How does it taste?”

“”It’s not bad.”Cen Shaoqing liked tea, and the tea bubble had a faint tea fragrance. ”

It was indeed more suited to his taste.

“Of course, it would be even better if the tea had been washed! ”

“After picking the tea, the two continued to walk down the mountain. ”

Cen Shaoqing walked behind.

Ye Zao walked in front.

“Her figure was light as she shuttled through the forest. In a short while, a bunch of flowers appeared in her hand. She was like an elf dancing among the flowers. The Breeze was like a Buddha. The faint fragrance of the flowers lingered at the tip of her nose. ”

Cen Shaoqing watched her back as she walked away. He stroked the Buddha beads in his hand and the expression on his face softened.

“If others saw this scene, they would definitely be shocked! ”

Who Was Fifth Master Cen?

He had his own business empire at the age of eighteen and had a mysterious force behind him.

“No matter who saw him, they had to respectfully call him fifth master Cen. ”

“In the past thirty-one years, there had never been a member of the opposite sex around Fifth Master Cen. Even his assistants and secretaries were men. ” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“But now, the dignified fifth master Cen was following behind a little girl, and he had to act according to her orders! ”

This was too unbelievable!

“This is for you.”Cen Shaoqing had just finished dealing with the leaf raspberries when Ye Zhuo handed him a handful of red fruits.

“CEN Shaoqing asked, “What’s This?” ”

“”Goat milk fruit.”Ye Zhuo continued, “You haven’t eaten goat milk fruit before, right?” ”

Cen Shaoqing shook his head slightly and picked up the goat milk fruit to taste.

Sour.

Extremely Sour.

But Cen Shaoqing still controlled the expression on his face.

“What do you think of the taste?”Ye Zhuo continued to ask.

“Very good.”

Ye Zhuo stuffed all the remaining goat milk fruits in his hands into Cen Shaoqing’s hands. “These are all for you. I can’t eat anything too sour.”
