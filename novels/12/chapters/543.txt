“”Okay.”Zhao shuning nodded, a smug look flashing in his eyes. ”

It seemed that Ye Shu was doomed this time.

“Feng Qianhua said somewhat worriedly, “Aunt Lin, I don’t think Sister Ye Shu is the kind of unreasonable person. You can talk to her nicely. I believe that she will definitely agree.” ”

“Old Madam Lin sighed and looked at Feng Qianhua. “Qianhua, do you really think that everyone in this world is as kind as you? That B * Tch Ye Shu, she can’t even compare to half of you!” ”

“Feng Qianhua smiled embarrassedly. “Aunt Lin, you think too highly of me.” ”

“Zhao shuning smiled and said, “Qianhua, you’re already very good! What’s there to be modest about?” ”

12:30 pm.

Feng Qianhua proposed to leave.

Aunt Zhang sent Feng Qianhua out.

“How was the Lin Family Last Night?”Feng Qianhua asked in a low voice.

“Aunt Zhang smiled and said, “Just like what Zhao shuning said, it caused a ruckus! Qianhua, you’re still the best!” ”

“Right now, there were only two choices in front of ye Shu and her daughter. ”

Either change their surname.

Or get the hell out of the Lin family.

“Unfortunately, Feng Qianhua did not need to do anything. She only needed to move her lips. Old Lady Lin was extremely grateful to Feng Qianhua. ”

“It’s just a small trick.”

The two of them had just stepped out of the door when they saw ye Zao Walk in.

He saw ye Zao.

Feng Qianhua’s eyes narrowed slightly.

She did not know if it was an illusion.

She had a feeling that ye Zao was even more difficult to deal with than ye Shu. She subconsciously tightened her grip on the bag containing the thermos bucket.

“”Zao Zao,”Feng Qianhua greeted ye Zao with a smile. ”

Ye Zao raised his eyes slightly and swept his gaze across the bag in Feng Qianhua’s hand. “Auntie Feng.”

Feng Qianhua heaved a sigh of relief.

It seemed that ye Zao was not as wise as she had imagined.

“If ye Zao was really that wise, he could have ignored her. ”

But Ye Zao was not.

“Ye Zao continued, “Auntie Feng, are you here to deliver food to my grandmother?” ”

Feng Qianhua nodded and smiled. “I’m here to deliver some soup to your grandmother.”

“When the two of them brushed past each other, ye Zao sniffed lightly and his peripheral vision landed on the bag. His eyes narrowed slightly. ”

Ye Zao had just walked to the front door of the manor when he saw the butler laboriously carry a white plastic bucket to the kitchen.

“Grandpa Butler.”Ye Zao jogged forward. “Let me do it.”

“The Butler smiled and raised his head. “Miss, this is too heavy. You Can’t carry it! It weighs more than 80 kilograms!”Although ye Zao had just arrived at the Lin family, the butler could tell that ye Zao and Feng Xianxian were not the same type of people. ”

“Is it that heavy?”Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly. “Why don’t you let me try?”

The Butler let go. “Then you can try.”

Ye Zao picked up the plastic bucket with one hand and walked forward lightly. It looked as if the thing in his hand had no weight at all.

The Butler was stunned. He looked at ye Zao and almost forgot to react.

“”Grandpa Butler, where should I send this to?”Ye Zao looked back slightly. ”

The Butler finally reacted and immediately followed ye Zao’s footsteps. “Send... send it to the warehouse at the back.” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Ye Zhuo carried the bucket with one hand. As he walked, he chatted with the housekeeper. “Grandpa Housekeeper, does aunt Feng send soup to my grandmother every day?” ”

“The housekeeper nodded. “Yes, she has sent it for more than ten years.” ”

Ye Zhuo narrowed his eyes. “Then she is quite patient.”

“The housekeeper continued, “The old lady had a serious illness before. She saw many famous doctors but to no avail. In the end, it was Miss Feng who asked for a prescription from the godly doctor. After the old lady drank the health-preserving soup that she sent, her illness was slowly suppressed. Then, she drank it for more than ten years.” ”

“Can you let me take a look at that prescription?”

“The Butler shook his head. “Not to mention you, I’m afraid that even the old lady herself has never seen the prescription.” ”

“So Mysterious?”The image of Feng Qianhua holding something appeared in ye Zao’s mind.

“The butler explained, “I heard that the godly doctor has a strange temper. Other than him and the patient, no one else can see the prescription he gave. So, Miss Feng always cooks the health-preserving soup before sending it over.” ”

Ye Zao narrowed her beautiful eyes. “Then what time does she send it over every day?”

“Around...”the butler thought for a moment. “Around 11 am.”

Ye Zao nodded slightly.

...

Phoenix Manor.

“An old man with white hair sat in front of the garden. His gaze was somewhat profound. Although she did not say anything, she gave people an inexplicable sense of sadness. ”

“Just then, a pretty girl came over and said gently, “Aunt, my mother asked me to bring you some pastries.” ”
