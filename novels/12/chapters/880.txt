Chapter 881: 206: Can’t turn a blind eye (18th watch)1

Translator: 549690339

“With the help of Song Chenyu and Zhou Rui’s understanding of Cen Yuyan these days, Zhou Rui had a thorough understanding of Cen Yuyan’s personality.”

Perhaps it was because she had been the Cen family’s fourth young miss since she was young.

“Although Cen Yuyan was already 39 years old, her IQ was not even comparable to a minor.”

“As for Cen Yuyan, she only needed to put on a good show.”

“While she was at it, she was selling her misery.”

“The Cen family was a high-class family. No matter what kind of rich and powerful family they were, they could not compare to the CEN family. Therefore, regarding the issue of family background, Zhou Rui could not hide it at all. Being born into an ordinary family would instead win Cen Yuyan’s good impression.”

“For a young miss like Cen Yuyan, she liked to look down on everything with an aloof and compassionate attitude.”

“”I don’t dislike you.”Cen Yuyan reached out and held Zhou Rui’s hand. “Zhou Rui, don’t underestimate yourself. Although you were born average, the current you isn’t worse than anyone else!””

“Zhou Rui lowered his head, “Yuyan, you’re the first girl I’ve ever seriously liked. I hope that we can continue to walk together, but I’m afraid that your family and friends won’t think well of me. After all, the difference between our families isn’t just a little bit. Why don’t we take advantage of this moment and part on good terms?””

“”Zhou Rui, what are you talking about? ! What do you mean by good terms and good terms? !”CEN Yuyan continued, “Before I break up with you, you’ll always be my boyfriend! “Also, my friend also thinks highly of you. She’s the same as me. She’s not the kind of person who cares about her family background! “As for my family, they’ll also respect my opinion! “So, you don’t need to have such worries and concerns at all!””

“Really?”Zhou Rui raised his head and looked at Cen Yuan with a face full of disbelief.

“But in his heart, he was mocking her.”

“Cen Yuyan, this old woman, was really stupid. He casually said a few words, but she actually took it seriously. She was simply easier to deceive than those university students who had just graduated.”

“Thinking of how he was going to become the CEN family’s son-in-law in the future, CEN fifth master’s brother-in-law, Zhou Rui was extremely proud in his heart.”

“Once he married Cen Yuyan, he would be able to do whatever he wanted in the capital!”

Zhou Rui had never thought that his old Zhou family would flourish in his hands!

He heard that Cen Shaoqing was an unmarried man.

“An unmarried man had no descendants. In the future, he would be the only heir of the Cen family. The child he had with Cen Yuyan would also be the only bloodline of the Cen family.”

“At that time, the entire Cen family would be his!”

The other three sisters of the Cen family had already married and had children. This daughter-in-law would definitely not be able to return home to inherit the family property. The only ones left would be him and Cen Yuyan.

“The more Zhou Rui thought about it, the more excited he became. It was as if he had already become the owner of the CEN family.”

“However, at that time, the Cen family could no longer be called the CEN family. It should be called the Zhou family!”

“”Of course it’s true!”Cen Yuyan hugged Zhou Rui. “Zhou Rui, I love you. I will always be with you and you are not allowed to change your heart! If you dare to change your heart...””

“Before Cen Yuyan could finish her sentence, Zhou Rui said, “If I change my heart, I will be struck by lightning and die a horrible death!””

“Don’t talk nonsense!”Cen Yuyan was so scared that she covered Zhou Rui’s mouth.

“Zhou Rui hugged Cen Yuyan tightly. “Yuyan, my love for you will last forever. As long as you don’t change your heart and fall in love with other men, I won’t Change My Heart!””

Cen Yuyan took the initiative to kiss Zhou Rui. “I’m the same as you. I Won’t change my heart no matter what!”

“”Thank you, Yuyan.”Zhou Rui kissed Cen Yuyan back emotionally.”

But he didn’t take the next step.

This made Cen Yuyan very surprised.

“She originally thought that what happened next would be logical, but she didn’t expect Zhou Rui to be a gentleman. It was clearly very hard for him to endure, but he didn’t take even half a step.”

This made Cen Yuyan even more certain that Zhou Rui was the person who was worthy of being entrusted with her life.

“”Zhou Rui?”Cen Yuyan raised her head to look at Zhou Rui, her eyes brimming with spring.”

“Zhou Rui hugged Cen Yuyan just like that. How could he not understand the meaning behind Cen Yuyan’s eyes when he was living among the flowers, he continued, “Yuyan, you’re a good girl. I want to cherish you properly. I Can’t touch you now. What if your family isn’t satisfied with me after we’re together? That would be unfair to you.””

Zhou Rui would always be like this.

“No matter what he did, he would always put himself first.” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Cen Yuyan smiled and said, “Even if all of them aren’t satisfied with you, I still want to be with you. Zhou Rui, don’t think so much! It’s enough that I love you.”After saying that, CEN Yuyan took the initiative to kiss Zhou Rui again.”

This kiss was too suggestive.

“Zhou Rui also knew that it was almost time. If he continued to keep Cen Yuyan’s appetite, it would only backfire.”

“The two of them tangled together, going from the living room to the bedroom.”

An hour later.

“Cen Yuyan lay in Zhou Rui’s arms. “Zhou Rui, do you mind that this isn’t my first time?””

“”No.”Zhou Rui endured the nausea and kissed Cen Yuyan on the forehead. “I just need to know that you have me in your heart. Yuyan, it’s already the 21st century. Don’t think too much.””

“”Zhou Rui, thank you.””

“Zhou Rui looked at the time on his phone. “It’s late, let’s go to bed early.””

“Okay.”Cen Yuyan nodded.

“When she woke up the next morning, Zhou Rui was no longer in bed.”

“She could faintly hear Zhou Rui lowering his voice and talking to someone in the bathroom. Cen Yuyan narrowed her eyes. Girls were curious, and she was no exception.”

Cen Yuyan was very curious when she heard Zhou Rui deliberately lowering his voice.

Could it be...

That Zhou Rui was carrying her outside?

Cen Yuyan walked over quietly and leaned against the door. She could clearly hear the voices inside. “Did you withdraw your investment? Why did you withdraw your investment?”

“”I have very important people to accompany right now, so I don’t have time to come over.””

“I’ll think of a way to settle the money issue. You first stabilize the employees who are about to leave.”

“That’s all for now.”

“Although it was only a few sentences, Cen Yuyan could tell that something must have happened to Zhou Rui’s company.”

“It turned out that in Zhou Rui’s heart, she was more important than the company and his career.”

“Otherwise, Zhou Rui wouldn’t have said that he had very important people to accompany.”

“Thinking of this, the corners of Cen Yuyan’s mouth curled up into a smile. She turned around and walked towards the bedroom.”

“Zhou Rui heard the faint footsteps, and a smug look appeared in his eyes.”

Wait.

The fish was about to take the bait.

“It wasn’t in vain for him to spend the whole night with Cen Yuyan last night,”

cen Yuyan returned to the bedroom and began to change her clothes.

“A moment later, Zhou Rui also walked out of the bathroom and saw that Cen Yuyan had already woken up, he said with some surprise, “Yuyan, why are you awake so early? It’s only eight o’clock now. Sleep a little longer and I’ll make you breakfast. I’ll call you after breakfast is ready.””

“”Wait a moment,”Cen Yuyan said.”

“What’s Wrong?”Zhou Rui asked.

“Cen Yuyan continued, “Zhou Rui, let me ask you. Are you hiding something from me?”Zhou Rui’s company had a problem. As Zhou Rui’s girlfriend, she naturally could not turn a blind eye and ignore it.”

“No.”Zhou Rui shook his head.

Cen Yuyan narrowed her eyes. “Really?”

“Zhou rui smiled and said, “Really.””

“Cen Yuyan stood up and held Zhou Rui’s hand. She said very seriously, “Zhou Rui, we are boyfriend and girlfriend. We have the most intimate relationship. I don’t want you to hide anything from me.””

Zhou Rui was a smart person.

“He knew that he couldn’t immediately reveal his motive. It was too obvious. He had to get Cen Yuyan to take the initiative to give him the money. After all, Cen Yuyan was working for him now, not him.”

“”It’s really nothing, Yuyan. Don’t think too much.”Zhou Rui patted Cen Yuyan’s head and continued, “What do you want to eat in the morning? I’ll make it for you.””

Cen Yuyan thought for a moment. “I want to eat a sandwich.”

“Sure.”Zhou Rui nodded. “Then I’ll go and Cook First.”

“Cen Yuyan continued, “Zhou Rui, are you really not hiding anything from me?””

“”I’m really not. Silly Girl, don’t let your imagination run wild.”After saying that, Zhou Rui turned around and went to the kitchen.”

Cen Yuyan looked at Zhou Rui’s back and her face was full of smiles.

All of Zhou Rui’s actions were telling her that she had not misjudged him.

He was a good man that was hard to come by.

Zhou Rui did not seek power or money when he was with her.

“Soon, Zhou Rui finished making breakfast. “Yuyan, come out and eat.””

“I’m Coming.”Cen Yuyan washed up and went to the dining room to eat.

“Zhou Rui not only made a sandwich, but he also made porridge. He even thoughtfully gave the porridge to Cen Yuyan Sheng. “The porridge I just made is a little hot. Let Me Blow on it for you.””

“Although Zhou Rui was younger than Cen Yuyan, Cen Yuyan could not see the generation gap in him at all. She was the one being taken care of when she was with Zhou Rui.”

“Everyone said that it was very tiring for siblings to fall in love with a woman, but Cen Yuyan did not think so.”
