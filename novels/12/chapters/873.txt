Chapter 874: 201: face smacking (13th watch)2

Translator: 549690339

She had been working on this painting since March last year. She didn’t expect it to be completed under such circumstances.

Liu Caiyi knew that everyone would be shocked when her painting was completed.

But she didn’t expect everyone to be so shocked.

“”Vice president Liu, I’ve finished painting. How much longer do you need?” ”

“At this moment, a light voice appeared in the air. ”

It was ye Zao’s voice.

Finished drawing?

What the Hell Could Ye Zao Draw?

“I’ve finished drawing too.”

“Liu Caiyi’s eyes were filled with disdain. She put down her brush and turned around to look at Ye Zao. Her gaze landed on the painting beside ye Zao, and when she saw it, she was immediately stunned. ”

Her face was deathly pale.

She was completely dumbfounded.

“This, this painting was painted by Ye Zao. ”

The background was night.

“The entire village was shrouded in darkness, and the sky was filled with bright stars. ”

“On a summer night, two or three children were holding cattail leaf fans and catching fireflies. ”

The Fireflies’specks of light were just in time to reflect the stars in the sky.

“The silver candle autumn light was reflected on the cold painting screen, and the light luo small fan was fluttering against the Fireflies. ”

The night sky of the heavenly steps was as cold as water. They sat and watched the Morning Glory Vega Star.

“Not far away, there were a few children surrounding the old man with a white beard, listening to the story of the past. ”

“No matter which angle one looked at it from, there were no flaws in the picture. ”

It was a very simple picture.

There were three colors in total.

But it was such a simple picture that resonated with everyone. Everyone automatically put themselves into the roles in the picture.

In their paintings were old men telling stories. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

They were children catching fireflies...

Or passers-by chatting in the shade.

Only then did Liu Caiyi realize why everyone was so shocked just now.

She couldn’t believe it.

She couldn’t believe that this painting was painted by Ye Zao.

She couldn’t believe that ye Zao had such a skill.

She thought that she could beat ye Zao beautifully.

“Although Liu Caiyi did not want to admit it, at this moment, she had to admit that ye Zao’s painting was indeed endowed with a soul. ”

The greatest success of an artist was to be able to resonate with the audience.

Ye Zao did it.

“At this moment, everyone’s emotions were immersed in the painting. ”

They could not extricate themselves.

“Elder Qi reacted at this moment and walked to ye Zao’s side. He said very sincerely, “Miss Ye, everyone has witnessed your ability. I hope that you can consider the position of president of the Association.” ”

“Ye Zhuo’s expression was indifferent, “Thank you for your kindness, elder Qi, but I’m not interested in the position of president. You should leave it to those who need it. For example, vice president Liu is not bad. She’s a rare talent.” ”

What was the point of Liu Caiyi sitting in the position of President Now?

Ye Zhuo’s words were even more ruthless than a slap to her face!

Could it be that she was only fit to use what ye Zao did not want?

Liu Caiyi’s entire body was trembling.

She wished she could find a hole to hide in!

“Ye Zao turned to look at Liu Caiyi and second elder. “Oh right, I’m waiting for your apology in the Micro World.” ”

Liu Caiyi could not put on any expression.

Second Elder’s expression was also very bad.

Who would have thought that ye Zao would win?

Liu Caiyi did not even think that ye Zao could draw.

“In her heart, Ye Zao was a Missy who did not know anything. ”

“This time, if she did not see it with her own eyes, she would not believe that it was real! ”

“After saying that, ye Zao turned around and walked down the stage. ”

Old Mrs. Cen stood up excitedly to welcome ye Zao. “Ye! You were really amazing just now!”

“”I also think I’m pretty amazing.”Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly and continued, “This place is really boring. Grandma Cen, Let’s go back.” ”

The Experience Tonight had ruined all of ye Zao’s good impressions of the Chinese art world!

“”Okay, let’s go back.”Old Mrs. Cen nodded. ”

“Just when the two of them decided to leave, old Mrs. Cen seemed to have thought of something and walked back. “Yezi, wait a moment.” ”

“What’s Wrong?”Ye Zhuo looked back slightly.

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “I’ll go and bring your drawing. You drew so well, we can’t let these people off so easily.” ”

“As she finished speaking, Old Mrs. Cen quickly walked up to the stage. Before anyone could react, she took down the drawing on the easel and turned around to leave. She looked extremely dashing. ”

“Elder Qi caught up to old Mrs. Cen. “Sister Tang, don’t go. If you have something to say, say it properly.” ”

“”There’s nothing to talk about.”Old Madam Cen shook off elder Qi’s hand, she said angrily, “I can finally see that you’re not a good person. If you’re a good person, then there were so many people who misunderstood my granddaughter-in-law just now, but I didn’t see you stand up and say anything to my granddaughter-in-law! I’ve finally seen through you!” ”

“Elder Qi continued, “Sister Tang, I’ll apologize to you. I’ll apologize to Miss Ye.” ”

Elder Qi was also very regretful.

He regretted that he had not always trusted ye Zhuo.

But now.

What was the use of regretting?

“”Apologize? If an apology is useful, why do you need the police?”Old Lady Lin looked at elder Qi, then, she said, “Besides, if I were to hammer you for plagiarism in front of so many people and then apologize to you, would you be able to accept it?” ”

“Ptui! Nothing!”

“After saying this, Old Lady Lin turned around and left. ”

“Looking at Old Lady Cen’s back view, elder Qi pinched his temples helplessly. ”

“If he could turn back time, he would definitely stop second elder! ”

“Second Elder stood at the side, his face flushed red. ”

“Today was supposed to be a good day for the election of the president. After such an incident, he could only announce that the election would be suspended and that it would be postponed. ”

“First Elder Guan Sheng was absent today. When he heard what second elder had done, he was so angry that his temples were throbbing. He cursed at second elder. ”

“”Do you even have a brain? Every day I’m not around, you create such a Big Mess for me! You actually think that Miss Ye is plagiarizing! That was the literary world’s assessment competition. If the literary world allowed their own people to plagiarize, what was the point of holding this assessment competition? If Miss Ye plagiarized, could she use two different languages to write out the problem solving process? Now, the calligraphy world, the chess world, and the literary world all treat miss ye like a treasure! But you actually pushed miss ye out!” ”

“At present, the calligraphy world and the chess world all wanted to rope in ye Zao. ”

“Originally, Guan Sheng also wanted ye Zao to join the Chinese painting world. ”

“Now that such a thing had happened, wanting ye Zao to join the Chinese Painting World? ”

It was simply a fantasy!

“Second Elder lowered his head. “I didn’t know that Miss Ye was so powerful...”if he had known that ye Zao was so powerful, he definitely wouldn’t have rammed into the gun! ”

“However, second elder only wanted to seek justice for Liu Caiyi, so he didn’t think too much about it. ”

“”If you don’t know, you can just misunderstand that Miss ye plagiarized?”The veins on Guan Sheng’s face bulged. “Why don’t you take a look at the occasion today!” ”

The second elder knew that he was in the wrong and did not say anything.

“Elder Qi took a step forward and said guiltily, “Actually, this matter is also my fault. I did not stop him in time. If I had stopped him, this kind of thing would not have happened!” ”

Guan Sheng took a look at elder qi and sighed deeply. His heart was very uncomfortable. “You are not a muddle-headed person usually. Why didn’t you stop him today?”

“”Because Miss Ye is too young.”Elder qi continued, “It’s my fault for not thinking things through.” ”

“Guan Sheng looked at second elder and continued, “A man’s words can not be taken back. Quickly go to the micro world and apologize to Miss Ye! This matter, our Chinese art world must show some sincerity!” ”

“He hoped that after second elder’s apology, Ye Zhuo would calm down and forgive them. ”

Second Elder was a little unwilling.

“No matter what, he was still a senior in the Chinese art world. Asking him to apologize to a junior? ”

Wouldn’t that be a joke?

He did not want to apologize.

He could not bring himself to do so.

“Seeing that second elder did not speak for a long time, Guan Sheng continued, “I asked you to apologize, did you hear me!” ”

Second elder withstood the immense pressure and nodded. “I got it.”
