“At this moment, Xian er was in a confused state. ”

“In fact, she sometimes hated herself. She clearly knew that there was no result for her to be with Yu senility, but she could not leave Yu senility. ”

“Firstly, it was because of Yu Senility’s power. ”

“Secondly, it was because she really liked him. ”

She liked Yu senility very much.

Very much.

It was precisely because she was so deeply in love that Xian er envied ye Zhuo.

Ye Zhuo lived a carefree life and loved him thoroughly.

“”Actually, you already have the answer in your heart.”Ye Zhuo poured Xian ‘er a cup of tea and continued, “In this world, there are many forks in the road. No matter what road it is, there are always people who choose it!” ”

“In fact, there was no road in this world at all. If there were too many people, it would become a road. ”

This was also the reason why there were people who came to every road.

“Xian ‘er picked up her teacup and the smile on her face was unclear. “Goddess, do you look down on girls like me?” ”

Ye Zao took a sip of his tea. “I only look down on people who know that the other party has a family but still want to disturb them.”

Xian ‘er and Yu Luan were still different in the end.

“Yu Luan was single in his old age, and Xian ‘er was one of his many female companions. ”

“They belonged to a group of people who were willing to fight and suffer, and there was no moral aspect involved. ”

“In this world, there were many people like Yu Xiannian. ”

Were they bad people?

Not really.

Perhaps they were better than others in some aspects.

It was just that their lifestyle was not quite the same as other people’s.

“Xian ‘er was stunned. “Really, goddess?” ”

“In Xian ‘er’s heart, ye Zhuo had always been an untouchable immortal. For a lowly person like her, Ye Zhuo probably looked down on her. ”

Ye Zhuo’s answer was beyond her expectations.

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“After saying that, ye Zhuo continued, “Xian ‘er, remember that a person should have a bottom line no matter what. If you keep your bottom line, everyone will respect you.” ”

“”Alright.”Xian ‘er knew what ye Zhuo meant and continued, “Goddess, don’t worry. I will never touch a man who has a family and a girlfriend no matter what.” ”

“Okay.”

“Xian ‘er continued, “Goddess, I’m so envious of you.” ”

It was pure envy and there was no hint of jealousy in it.

“Ye Zhuo smiled. “Xian ‘er, let me send you a message.” ”

“Sure.”Xian ‘er nodded.

“Ye Zao continued, “Relying on everyone to run, relying on the mountain to topple, only relying on yourself is the most reliable. A beautiful love is evenly matched.” ”

“Although ye Zao did not reject the relationship between Xian ‘er and Yu Xiannian, she did not like it either. ”

This kind of behavior was even less worthy of promotion.

There was a moment of loneliness in Xian ‘ER’s eyes.”... I don’t know anything.”

She also wanted to rely on herself.

But she didn’t have the strength.

“”The Earth doesn’t grow nameless grass.”Ye Zhuo continued, “You have many advantages, but you just didn’t realize it.” ”

“Really?”Xian ‘er’s eyes lit up as she looked at Ye Zhuo.

No one had ever said such words to her before.

She had always been denied existence.

“But today, Ye Zhuo actually praised her. ”

One had to know that ye Zao was her idol!

What kind of experience was it to be praised by her idol!

“”Of course it’s true.”Ye Zao looked at Xian ‘er. “Your figure is good, and your looks aren’t bad. If you walk the path of a model well, you will definitely shine in the future!” ”

“”But there are too few people who want to work with me. I’ve been in the industry for almost half a year,”Xian ‘er said. ”

“Ye Zhuo said, “It’s only half a year. Don’t be discouraged. “You have to persevere in everything. You Can’t fish in three days and cast the net in two days. “Then, in a turbid environment, you have to maintain your most sober self and keep your bottom line. What you should do and what you shouldn’t do. Fame and fortune can sometimes make a person, and many times, it can also destroy a person.” ”

“When ye Zhuo said these words, his tone was indifferent, but every word directly penetrated into the depths of Xian ‘er’s heart. ” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

This feeling was very strange.

“It made Xian ‘er, who had never been confident, instantly feel confident. ”

“”Goddess, thank you.”Xian ‘er looked at ye Zhuo. “I think I know what to do.” ”

“Mm.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and picked up the cup to drink with her. “I wish you a bright future and be the best version of yourself.”

“”I also wish that you become more and more beautiful, goddess, turning eighteen every year.” ”

Ye Zhuo finished the tea in the cup in one gulp. “Thank you.”

“Xian ‘er continued, “That Goddess...” ”

“”Yes?”Ye Zhuo saw Xian ‘er’s hesitant look and smiled. “If you have something to say, just say it.” ”
