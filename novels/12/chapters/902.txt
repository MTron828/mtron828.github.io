“Soon, it was time for lunch. Song Chenyu came to deliver food to Song Shiyu. ”

“”Third brother, it’s time to eat. Today, we have your favorite, stir-fried eggs with Chinese toon. The Chinese toon in this village is all natural and organic, and it tastes especially good.” ”

Song Shiyu lowered his head and glanced at the food song Chenyu brought over. “Don’t you have brown sugar ginger water?”

Brown sugar ginger water?

Song Chenyu was stunned for a moment before he quickly reacted. He had no idea when Song Shiyu had gotten used to drinking brown sugar ginger water like it was boiled water.

“I’ll Cook it for you right away.”

Song Chenyu went to the kitchen to cook brown sugar ginger water.

“Soon, a bowl of warm brown sugar ginger water was ready. “Third brother, you can start eating now.” ”

Song Shiyu drank a mouthful of brown sugar ginger water before starting to eat.

“After eating, song Shiyu ate a few anti-stress pills and walked around the courtyard. When he arrived at the courtyard, he ran into Yin Wei who was running in from outside. ”

“When she saw song Shiyu, Yin Wei subconsciously took a step back. “Song, CEO Song.” ”

Song Shiyu acted as if he didn’t see Yin Wei. He turned a deaf ear and was as cold as an ice sculpture.

Yin Wei shivered. She didn’t dare to look at Song Shiyu anymore.

In fact...

It wasn’t that song Shiyu had any opinions about Yin Wei. It was just that his personality was like this. He wouldn’t even give a glance to an unimportant person.

“Yin Wei gulped and quickly ran into the house. Then, she closed the door and covered her chest, looking as if she was still in fear. ”

“Seeing her like this, ye Zao smiled and said, “What’s wrong? Did you run into a Ghost?” ”

Yin Wei saw that there were no cameras around. “Scarier than a ghost!”

“What’s That?”Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly.

“Song Shiyu!”

Ye Zao laughed softly. “Is song Shiyu that scary?”

“Yes!”Yin Wei nodded very seriously. “Very!”

“You’re too timid.”Ye Zao poked Yin Wei’s forehead.

“Yin Wei said, “It’s not that I’m timid, it’s just that song Shiyu is too scary.” ”

Ye Zao took out a straw hat and put it on his head. “Let’s go quickly.”

“Where are we going?”Yin Wei asked.

“Ye Zao said, “The program team has arranged for rice transplants! Teacher Wei, Chang Yu, and the others have already gone over. There’s a total of eight plots of land. Let’s go early and come back early. We’ll come back in the afternoon to make delicious food.” ”

“Upon hearing that there was delicious food, Yin Wei’s eyes lit up. “I want to eat beggar’s Chicken Tonight, and I also want to eat spicy crayfish...” ”

“Then let’s go quickly.”Ye Zhuo put the remaining straw hat on Yin Wei’s head.

Yin Wei took a deep breath and followed behind ye Zhuo.

“The two of them came to the courtyard, but Song Shiyu was still standing there. ”

“Brother Song.”Ye Zhuo took the initiative to greet him.

Song Shiyu looked back slightly. “Where are you going?”

“”To the fields to transplant rice seedlings,”ye Zhuo answered. ”

Transplant?

What was transplanting rice seedlings?

Song Shiyu frowned without leaving a trace.

“Ye Zhuo saw song Shiyu’s confusion and explained, “Transplanting rice seedlings is to transplant rice seedlings into rice fields.” ”

“OH.”Song Shiyu nodded slightly.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “The scenery in the village is very good. If brother song is free in the afternoon, you can also go out for a walk. It’s not good to stay indoors all the time.”From the color of Song Shiyu’s skin, it could be seen that.., he is not a regular exerciser. ”

Even the sun is rare.

“Yes.”Song Shiyu then nodded.

“That I and only left first.”Ye Zhuo took Yin Wei to go out of the house.

“Yin Wei curiously way: “Leaf, you and song Shiyu how to Know?” ”

Ye zhuo way: “I see a doctor for his grandmother.”

“”Leaf, you really know medical skill?”Yin Wei surprised way. ” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“”Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “I’ve already told you. I’m a godly doctor, the kind that can match a Hua Tuo.” ”

“Yin Wei was about to believe him when she heard the second half of ye Zhuo’s sentence. She smiled and said, “You’re Bluffing!” ”

“”If you don’t believe me, then forget it.” ”

The two girls chatted and laughed as they walked out.

“In a short while, they arrived at the paddy field. ”

Wei Xingzhi and Chang Yu were already planting rice seedlings in the field.

“It was the first time for both of them to plant rice seedlings. Although it was not very beautiful, Wei Xingzhi and Chang Yu had already made a great breakthrough. ”

“After all, they had never seen it before. ”

Ye Zao neatly rolled up his pants legs and went down the field without even frowning.

“Yin Wei followed behind ye Zao and went down the field. However, she was frightened by a leech and screamed. ”

“What’s Wrong?”Ye Zao turned around to look at her.

“There are leeches!”

“Taking advantage of the fact that he was not paying attention, ye Zao quickly picked up the Leech and threw it away. Then, with a puzzled look, he said, “Where are the leeches? Wei Wei, are you seeing things?” ”
