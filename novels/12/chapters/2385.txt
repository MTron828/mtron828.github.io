Translator: 549690339

“In his view of love, there was no such word. ”

“At this moment, an Lizi’s heart was beating a little fast. ”

It almost jumped out of her chest.

Plop Plop Plop —

Again and again.

“Before an Lizi could react, dog two had already quickened its pace and caught up with Li Wen and fat tiger. ”

“An Lizi raised her head to look at him, her cheeks slightly red. ”

“Seeing her like this, Jin Ling moved closer to an lizi and teased, “Lizi, are you having an affair with that little brother in front of you?” ”

“”Lingling, what nonsense are you spouting!”An lizi continued, “I would never have an affair with anyone!” ”

“Hearing this, Chen Chen immediately moved closer, “That’s not necessarily true. Some things can’t be said too confidently.” ”

“”Aiya, there really isn’t! How could I be with him!”An Lizi directly denied it. ”

“Firstly, she still felt that dog two was joking with her. Secondly, she felt that she wasn’t dog two’s type. ”

“Therefore, dog two must be joking with her again! ”

“This dog, how could such a thing be used as a joke? ”

On the other side.

Bai Mo also came to the front hall.

“On the wedding stage, the eloquent emcee had already started to liven up the atmosphere. ”

“Bai Mo looked at the Emcee and then at the guests around her, unable to put on any expression. ”

Lin Ze should have been hers.

This wedding should have been hers.

But it had been snatched away by Bai Jingshu just like that.

Who Was Bai Jingshu?

How could she have everything she had at ease?

Everything should belong to her.

Bai Jingshu was a slut!

“Bai Mo held onto the handle of the chair beside her. Because she had used too much strength, her knuckles had already turned slightly white. ”

“At this moment, a figure walked over at high speed. Because it was too fast, it directly bumped into Bai Mo, causing her to almost fall to the ground. ”

“Just as Bai Mo was about to lose her temper, she raised her head and saw that the person who bumped into her was one of the bridesmaids, Chen Chen. The anger in her eyes instantly disappeared completely. ”

“Chen Chen immediately apologized, “I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I didn’t see anyone just now. Pretty Lady, Are You Alright?” ”

Bai Mo smiled and raised her head. “I’m fine.”

Chen Chen heaved a sigh of relief. “It’s good that you’re fine. I’ve been too busy today...”

“Bai Mo continued, “Miss Bridesmaid, you should hurry up and get back to work. I’m really fine.” ”

“”Alright. Thank you, Pretty Lady.” ”

Bai Mo shook her head. “I’m fine.”

“After confirming that Bai Mo was fine, Chen Chen left with a sigh of relief. ”

“When he saw Jin Ling’s voice in the crowd, Chen Chen shouted, “Lingling! Lingling! Quickly send some food to the dressing room. Jingshu said that she’s hungry.” ”

“There was not much time left before the auspicious time. At this time, he could not let the bride starve. ”

“”Alright, I’ll go right away.”Jin Ling made an OK gesture to Chen Chen across the crowd. ”

“Hearing that,. ”

Bai Mo released her hand and narrowed her eyes slightly.

Even God was helping her.

Just wait.

She was going to ruin Bai Jingshu’s reputation at today’s wedding.

“With that in mind, Bai Mo turned around and left. ”

“When she turned around, she glanced at the crowd. ”

Very good.

“The person who had followed her was no longer there, so she must have let down her guard. ”

“She had really thought that ye Zhuo was very capable, but it turned out that he was only so-so. ”

“Without the group of people who were watching her, Bai Mo’s movements were much more convenient. She went backstage and successfully found Jin Ling. ”

“At that moment, Jin ling was preparing pastries for Bai Jingshu. ”

“Bai Mo adjusted her expression and walked over to greet Jin Ling. “Hello, Miss Maid of Honor.” ”

Jin Ling raised her head to look at Bai mo. “Hello.”

“Bai Mo continued, “Let me introduce myself. I’m the bride’s cousin. My name is Bai Mo. . Um, I might have had a slight misunderstanding with my sister...” Bai Mo lowered her head. “It was all my fault in the past. I was too young and insensible, causing sister to be unhappy. But today, I’m here to bless sister. I hope that sister and brother-in-law can be happy for a long time.” ”

“Jin Ling was a kind-hearted female author. In addition, she did not know about the matter between Bai Jingshu and Bai Mo, so she only thought that the two of them were just normal sister conflicts. Hearing this, she felt that it was not easy for Bai Mo., she smiled and comforted her. “Miss Bai, don’t think too much. Jingshu is a very good person. I believe that she definitely won’t blame you anymore. There’s no overnight feud between sisters.” ”

“Bai Mo didn’t expect Jin Ling to be so gullible, she continued, “Thank you, Miss Bai. It’s said that birds of a feather flock together. I didn’t believe it in the past, but now I finally believe it. My Sister is as kind-hearted as you are. By the way, is all this food prepared for my sister?” ”

“Yes.”Jin Ling nodded.

“Bai Mo continued, “Then can I have a piece? These snacks look so tempting!” ”

“Sure.”Jin Ling picked up the pastries. “Take whatever you want. I’m going to send it over to Jingshu.”

“Bai Mo picked up a piece of pastries. “This will do. Little Missy, hurry up and send it over to my sister.” ”

“Jin Ling did not notice that when Bai Mo picked up the pastries, her ring finger and little finger accidentally swept across the pastries. ”

Bai Mo looked at Jin Ling with a mocking expression.

Stupid Earthling!

“Jin Ling took the pastries. “Miss Bai, I’ll go look for Jingshu then.” ”

“Hurry up.”Bai Mo nodded

Jin Ling turned around and left.

“Looking at Jin Ling’s back, Bai Mo’s lips curled up. ”

“She had smeared the pastries with an extremely rare aphrodisiac from the s galaxy. No matter who it was, as long as they fell for it, they would go from being obedient to being a slut. ”

“Today was Bai Jingshu and Lin Ze’s wedding. If Bai Jingshu went crazy on the spot, where would the Lin family and Lin Ze put their face? ”

“By then, Bai Jingshu would be a true abandoned woman! ”

“By then, Lin Ze would also realize how good she was. ”

Bai Mo took out the pastry from the pastry plate and placed it in her mouth to take a bite.

It had a very soft and sticky texture. It melted in her mouth and tasted very good.

Bai Mo ate the whole piece of pastry bit by bit.

“About ten minutes later, Jin Ling ran out of the makeup artist in a panic. ”

“Bai Mo walked forward and asked with concern, “What’s wrong with Miss Ye?” ” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Jin Ling said with some guilt, “N-nothing. That Miss Bai, if there’s nothing else, then... then don’t go to the makeup artist. Oh right, don’t let anyone else in! I’ll go look for Miss Ye!” ”

Bai Mo nodded. “Okay.”
