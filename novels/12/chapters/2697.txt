Chapter 2698: 607: she was completely dumbfounded

Translator: 549690339

She and Feng Yang had been together for ten years.

“In her opinion, Feng Yang should have been heartbroken and begged bitterly when she broke up with him. ”

But Feng Yang didn’t do any of that.

“Not only did Feng Yang not do any of that, he even told her heartlessly that they would never have a relationship again. ”

Ten years of her youth had been exchanged for such a scumbag.

Zhou Ziyue regretted not breaking up with Feng Yang earlier back then.

“If they had broken up earlier, she might have become a rich lady by now. ”

“Zhou ziyue pinched her fingers, her eyes filled with hatred. ”

It was also at this moment that the only guilt in Zhou Ziyue’s heart disappeared without a trace.

“Ziyue.”

“At this moment, the door was pushed open from outside. ”

“Zhou Ziyue immediately wiped the tears off her face. She looked back at the door and said with a smile, “Mom.” ”

“Ye Sui said with a smile, “Ziyue, how was your date today?” ”

“”It was pretty good,”Zhou Ziyue replied. ”

“What does Xiao Ma Mean Now?”Ye Sui asked.

“”Mom, what do you mean?”Zhou Ziyue asked. ”

“Ye Sui continued, “Did he tell you when he brought home to meet his parents? When did you guys get engaged?” ”

“Although ye Sui was not a rich lady, he knew how important status was to this circle. ”

“As long as Zhou Ziyue did not get promoted, her position would not be so stable. ”

“Hearing this, Zhou Ziyue shook her head. “Not yet.” ”

Ye Sui narrowed his eyes. “Then what does he mean now?”

“Zhou Ziyue thought for a moment and continued, “From the looks of it, he should be treating me as a marriage partner to get along with.” ”

“Really?”Ye Sui asked.

“”Yes.”Zhou Ziyue nodded. “If you’re worried, you can actually rush Bai Jingshu. After all, Bai Jingshu is the matchmaker.” ”

“It was best for Bai Jingshu, the matchmaker, to be the one to talk about the engagement. ”

“Zhou Ziyue’s words were like a wake-up call. Ye Sui’s face was instantly filled with a smile. “Ziyue, you’re right. I’ll go look for Bai Jingshu right away.” ”

Bai Jingshu happened to be at home today.

“When ye Sui arrived, Bai Jingshu was taking care of the child. ”

“”Second aunt,”Bai Jingshu greeted when she saw ye Sui. ”

Ye Sui smiled and went forward. “Jingshu!”

“Bai Jingshu stood up from her chair and said with a smile, “Second aunt, please have a seat.” ”

“Ye Sui continued, “Aiya, this little baby really changes every day. He’s getting cuter and cuter.” ”

Bai Jingshu smiled.

“Ye Sui complimented the child a few more times before continuing, “Oh right, Jingshu, have you been in contact with that pony recently?” ”

“”Not at the moment. What’s the matter, second aunt?”Bai Jingshu asked. ”

“Ye Sui thought for a moment before continuing, “I was thinking that Ziyue isn’t young anymore. It’s time to settle the matter.” ”

“”So Soon?”Bai Jingshu looked at ye Sui in surprise, ”

“”Not so fast. In our hometown, girls as old as Ziyue can even walk,”ye Sui said. ”

“Bai Jingshu explained, “Second aunt, I mean Ziyue and Ma Lu have known each other for less than a month. Isn’t it a little early to talk about this?” ”

“Ye Sui smiled and said, “Jingshu, as the saying goes, if fate brings us a thousand miles to meet, it’s hard to hold hands without fate. As long as the two of them are fated, time is not a problem at all! Don’t you think so?” ”

“”But the two of them haven’t gotten along yet!”Bai Jingshu continued, “It’s still too early for us to talk about this! Actually, some things have to be done naturally. It’s not good to be too anxious.” ”

“Speaking up to this point, Bai Jingshu paused and changed the topic, “Second aunt, actually, I’m just trying to matchmake Ma Lu and ziyue. As for the specifics, I’ll let the two young people develop on their own. Now, I’m not only the matchmaker for Ziyue, but I’m also related to Ziyue. If I say too much in front of the Ma family, the Ma family will think that our Ziyue can’t get married!” ”

“Ye Sui thought about it and agreed. After all, Zhou Ziyue was a girl, so she had to be more reserved. If she took too much initiative, it was inevitable that people would look down on her. ”

“Ye Sui thought about it and said, “Jingshu, you’re right. But you have to worry about Ziyue.” ”

“”Okay, don’t worry, second aunt,”Bai Jingshu said. ”

“After chatting with Bai Jingshu for a while, ye Sui turned around and left. ”

“Back in the guest room, Zhou Ziyue asked, “Mom, how was it? What did Bai Jingshu Say?” ”

“Ye Sui passed on Bai Jingshu’s words to Zhou Ziyue, then, he said, “Actually, what Bai Jingshu said makes sense. If we follow her closely and even mention the engagement to the Ma family, the Ma family will think that you won’t be able to get married!”! “So, ziyue, the most important thing for you to do now is to grab hold of Ma Lu’s heart tightly and let her have no choice but to take the initiative to propose the engagement with you.” ”

“Hearing that, Zhou Ziyue frowned slightly and looked at ye Sui. “Mom, this… This might be a little difficult.” ”

“Why?”Ye Sui asked.

“Zhou ziyue said, “Ma Lu has been hugging me on every date with me now. His mind is obviously not on me. He just lacks an official girlfriend. Do you think he will do anything for me?” ”

“”Since Xiao Ma has taken a liking to you, it means that there must be something about you that attracts Xiao Ma.”Ye Sui looked at Zhou Ziyue, then he said, “Ziyue, you can’t belittle yourself. Besides, you’re not ugly. You’re better than those coquettish B * tches out there!” ”

Zhou Ziyue did not say anything.

“Ye Sui continued, “Are you still going out tomorrow?” ”

“”I’m Not Going Out Tomorrow,”Zhou Ziyue said. ”

“Xiao Ma didn’t ask you out again?”Ye Sui was a little confused.

“No.”Zhou Ziyue continued to shake her head.

“Ye Sui frowned slightly. He didn’t understand what Ma Lu meant, “Since Xiao Ma didn’t ask you out, then you should spend the next few days chatting with Xiao Ma and finding common topics to talk about. I heard that the thing that couples are most afraid of is not having common topics after a long time.” ”

“”Yes, Mom, don’t worry, I know.”Zhou Ziyue nodded. ”

“Ye Sui asked again, “Feng Yang’s side has been completely cut off, right?” ”

“Yes.”Zhou Ziyue continued to nod.

“Seeing this, ye Sui’s eyes were filled with relief. “It’s good that it’s completely cut off. Ziyue, you must not be muddle-headed at this time. A man like Feng Yang is not worth you being muddle-headed.” ”

What was Feng Yang?

Feng Yang wasn’t worthy of Zhou Ziyue at all.

“Zhou ziyue continued, “Mom, don’t worry. I’ll treat it as if I fed my youth to a dog!” ”

“”It’s best if you can think like that!”Ye Sui smiled. “Ziyue, I believe that you’ll definitely be better than your aunt in the future!” ”

Du Du du —

“At this moment, there was a knock on the door. ”

Ye Sui put away the smile on her face and walked over to open the door.

“Little Shu.”

The person who knocked on the door was none other than ye Shu.

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “Sister, Zhuozhuo and her fiancé will come over for dinner tonight. Let’s eat half an hour earlier.” ”

“Zhuozhuo’s fiancé is here too?”Ye Sui asked.

“Yes.”Ye Shu nodded.

“Ye Sui smiled and said, “Okay, okay, okay.” ”

“After saying that, Ye Shu left. ”

“After ye Shu left, Zhou ziyue immediately asked, “Mom, Auntie just said that ye Zhuo and his fiancé will come tonight?” ”

“After coming to the Lin family for so many days, Zhou Ziyue had never seen ye Zhuo and her fiancé. ”

“”Yes.”Ye Sui nodded. “That’s what they said. That Idiot Ye Zhuo can actually marry into a rich family! Ziyue, just watch. Her fiancé must be an old and ugly old man!” ”

“I don’t think so!”Zhou Ziyue said.

“”Why Not!”Ye Sui crossed his arms in front of his chest, “Otherwise, with ye Zao Like That, which rich young master would like her!” ”

“With that said, it was not without reason. Thinking of this, Zhou Ziyue’s eyes showed a hint of a smile. ”

Ma Lu was at least young.

“Knowing that ye Zao’s fiancé was Old and ugly, her heart instantly calmed down. ”

At night.

Zhou Ziyue specially dressed up and arrived at the restaurant.

“When they arrived, ye Zao and Cen Shaoqing had yet to arrive. ”

“”Aunty, uncle-in-law.”Zhou ziyue called out politely, “Zao Zao and the others haven’t arrived yet?” ”

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “Quickly sit down. Zao Zao should be here soon.” ”

Zhou Ziyue sat down on her seat.

“Not long after, the sound of footsteps came from outside the door. ”

“Zouzhuo and the others have arrived.”

“As soon as she said that, a slender figure walked in from outside. ”

Zhou Ziyue was stunned.

“She saw that the person who walked in from outside was wearing a simple white hoodie, black jeans, and a pair of black Martin boots, which made her look cool and wild. ”

“Looking up, she saw a stunning face. ”

Smiling and smiling.

This was…

Ye Zhuo.

It had been three years since they last saw each other. He did not expect ye Zhuo to still be so beautiful.

“Mom and Dad.”

“”Zhuo Zhuo,”Lin Jincheng said with a smile, “Take a seat. Your mom knew that you were coming back, so she specially asked the kitchen to cook a lot of dishes that you like.” ”

“Ye Shu asked, “Where’s Shaoqing?” ”

“Ye Zhuo replied, “He’s parking the car. He’ll come in right away.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Shu nodded.

“Just as she was speaking, another set of footsteps could be heard. ”

Zhou Ziyue raised her head again and saw a tall figure.

“The man was wearing a moon-white long gown with a pair of buttons. He wore a long black coat and held a string of dark red Buddhist beads in his hand. His entire being exuded a sense of alienation, making one unable to catch up to him. ”

He looked like a demon and a Buddha.

“Uncle and aunt.”𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“After he said that, the man walked to Ye Zao’s side and sat down. He whispered in a very intimate manner. ”

Zhou Ziyue was dumbfounded.

This…

This was ye Zao’s fiancé?
