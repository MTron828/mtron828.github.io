Translator: 549690339

“Okay.”Sun Shu nodded as she sized up ye Zao.

The girl looked like she was about 18 or 19 years old.

She was tall and had snow-like skin.

“She wore a thin knitted sweater with a round collar on her upper body and a pair of pants that revealed her ankles. She wore a pair of white canvas shoes under her feet. Although she was dressed very simply, she gave off a feeling that could topple cities. ”

She looked like a vixen!

Sun Shu frowned slightly.

The daughter of this mistress was really different.

Which girl from a good family would wear such revealing clothes like her?

She was wearing pants that even exposed her ankles.

The collar of the sweater was also so big that her collarbone and neck could be seen clearly.

It was simply unsightly and immoral!

Despicable!

“Mr. Zhang continued, “I’ve already brought the person over. I’ll leave the rest to you.” ” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“”Alright, Go Do your work.”Sun Shu sent Mr. Zhang out of the door. ”

Ye Zhuo calmly sized up the environment in the office.

“The office was not big, but there were signs advertising women’s virtues everywhere. ”

There was a complete set of “Women’s ring”on the desk.

“Soon, Sun Shu walked in from outside. She looked at Ye Zhuo and spoke sternly, “When you come to our female Durban class, you must forget your identity as the eldest daughter of the Lin Family! From now on, you are just an ordinary student of the female Durban Class! Here, no one will spoil you! The students here go to bed at 11 o’clock sharp every night and get up at 4:30 in the morning. There are five hours of cultural lessons every day. The other classes train your hands-on skills, wash pots and dishes, sew and embroider. What do you know about housework?” ”

“I don’t know anything.”Ye Zhuo looked back slightly.

“”You still have the face to live in this world if you don’t know anything? “From today on, you must know everything! “We are a closed-door management here. Now, hand over your phone to me! “For the next 30 days, you are not allowed to have any contact with the outside world!” ”

Sun Shu extended her hand to Ye Zhuo.

“What if I don’t hand it over?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly.

Don’t hand it over?

Sun Shu did not expect ye Zao to dare to refute her. None of the students here dared to refute her. They raised their hands and gave ye Zao a slap. “You disrespectful B * Stard!”

Sun Shu was the niece of the person-in-charge here. There were countless students who had been beaten and scolded by her.

Unfortunately.

“Before Sun Shu’s hand could be flung away, it was grabbed by ye Zao. ”

“Her wrist was pinched ruthlessly by someone, and a bone-cracking pain was felt. ”

PA —

“The left side of her face was slapped ruthlessly by someone, and a palm print instantly swelled up. ”

It was a shocking sight.

“”Cheap Bastard, who did you say was a cheap bastard? HMM?”Ye Zao’s hand grabbed her hair just like that. His eyes and brows were smiling, and his tone was clear and shallow. ”

He looked a little evil.

Sun Shu was stunned. Her head was buzzing and she was seeing stars.

She had always been the one who slapped others. She did not expect to be slapped this time!

She did not even realize what was going on.

“Let go of me!”

“”Tell me, who is a B * Stard!”Ye Zao increased the strength in his hand. ”

It hurt.

It was very painful.

Sun Shu’s facial features were twisted from the pain.

“However, Ye Zhuo had no intention of letting go. Instead, he held her tighter and tighter. Sun Shu felt that her scalp was about to be torn off. With a trembling voice, she said, “I, I am the B * Stard...” ”

“Hearing the satisfactory answer, Ye Zhuo unhurriedly let go of Sun Shu’s hair. “I see that you are also a woman. Why do women have to make things difficult for women? Is this feeling of being pointed at and called a B * Stard really good?” ”

Sun Shu’s lowered eyes were filled with viciousness.

“She had been in the industry for so many years, but she had never fallen for anyone before. ”

This was the first time.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Who’s your leader?” ”

Sun Shu took a few steps back and aimed for the opportunity to quickly pick up the stun baton in the corner. She rushed over to Ye Zhuo. “Little B * Tch!”

Ye Zhuo nimbly avoided Sun Shu’s attack and sent a backward kick.

Bang —

Sun Shu was kicked to the ground and fell to the ground.

“Ye Zhuo took a step forward and walked over. He raised his foot and lightly stepped on her hand. He slightly lowered his eyes and looked down at her. “Tell me, who is your leader?” ”

Sun Shu’s face was deathly pale.

It hurt.

“Ye Zhuo did not seem to have used much strength under his feet, but in fact, her fingers were almost broken. ”

Ten fingers linked to the heart.

No one knew what kind of pain she was suffering now.

“”Say, I say,”Sun Shu continued, “Our leader is Sun, Sun Yiguo.” ”

Ye Zhuo moved his feet and pulled out the swivel chair behind the desk. He sat on it and crossed his legs.
