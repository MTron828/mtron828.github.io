“Qingqing!”An Lizi was on the verge of tears.

“”That’s it, I’m leaving First!”Zhang Qingqing glanced at an Lizi and turned to walk out of the door, looking as if she wanted to sever all ties with an Lizi. ”

“An Lizi quickly caught up to Zhang Qingqing. “Qingqing! Don’t go! I Promise You, I Promise You!” ”

Zhang Qingqing’s eyes were filled with satisfaction.

“As expected, an Lizi was still the same as when she was young. She was especially easy to manipulate. ”

“In fact, an Lizi’s personality was a little similar to Xia Xiaoman’s. If Xia Xiaoman was not soft-hearted and gullible, she would not have been deceived by an Dongliang for so long. If an Lizi had not caught up to her.., xia Xiaoman was still kept in the dark. ”

“Really?”Zhang Qingqing looked up at an Lizi.

“Really!”An Lizi nodded.

“This was the only thing they could do now. As long as Lin Ze didn’t like Zhang Qingqing, Zhang Qingqing wouldn’t be able to put on a big show by herself. ”

“”Then it’s a deal!”Zhang Qingqing continued, “Let’s meet at the clock tower at 10 o’clock tomorrow morning.” ”

“An Lizi was about to nod, but she quickly reacted and said, “I still have to discuss with Ah Ze. What if he doesn’t have time!” ”

“”That’s your business. Anyway, I’ll be waiting for you there on time tomorrow.” ”

An Lizi could only nod. “I’ll try my best.”

“Zhang Qingqing didn’t say anything else and turned to leave. At this time, it was better not to say too much. If she said too much, it would backfire. ”

“Looking at Zhang Qingqing’s back, an Lizi looked helpless. ”

What should she do?

What should she do?

“Under such circumstances, she could only invite Lin ze out. In order to prevent Lin ze from suspecting anything, an Lizi didn’t invite Lin Ze alone. She even invited dog two, fat tiger, and Li Wen, they said that they were going to play computer games together. ”

“Satisfied, Zhang Qingqing returned to the hotel and began to think about what she would wear the next day. ”

“At this moment, Zhang Qingqing’s stomach churned. She felt extremely nauseous and threw up by the side of the Bath. After throwing up, her face turned pale. ” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Zhang Qingqing leaned against the bath and stood there for a while. Her stomach hadn’t been feeling well these few days, and her appetite wasn’t very good. She kept feeling like throwing up. She didn’t know what was wrong with her. ”

“Suddenly, Zhang Qingqing thought of something. Her eyes widened in disbelief. ”

She...

Could she be pregnant?

“Thinking of this, Zhang Qingqing’s face turned even paler. ”

No.

It couldn’t be.

“Although she had been with Wu Youyu for a long time, there were always protective measures. There was only one time when she didn’t take any. After that, she thought that Wu Youyu was too old and wouldn’t be able to win the bid, so she was too lazy to take the medicine! ”

“It could not be that coincidental, right? ”

“As she thought about it, Zhang Qingqing felt nauseous again, and her stomach could not stop churning. ”

“After vomiting, Zhang Qingqing could not stay calm anymore. She immediately took her bag and went to the hospital. ”

“There were no holidays in the hospital. No matter what day it was, there were many people in the hospital. ”

“After waiting in line for an hour, Zhang Qingqing finally got the results. She took the ultrasound sheet to the Doctor, who smiled and said, “There is a pregnancy sac in the uterus...” ”

“”There’s a pregnancy sac? What do you mean by a pregnancy sac? Doctor, I’m not pregnant, right?”Zhang Qingqing asked impatiently. ”

“”Having a pregnancy sac means that you’re pregnant,”the Doctor continued. “You’re already four weeks pregnant.” ”

Four weeks...

She was already four weeks pregnant.

Zhang Qingqing’s face turned pale as if she had been struck by lightning.

What should she do?

“Seeing Zhang Qingqing like this, the Doctor felt a little strange. Wasn’t being pregnant a happy thing? Why was Zhang Qingqing’s expression so ugly. ”

“The Doctor lowered his head. When he saw that she was not married on the medical record, he understood what was going on. ”

She was 20 years old.

“She was probably still in university and did not have a boyfriend by her side. Nowadays, Young People’s private lives were getting more and more chaotic. ”

“”You can’t have this child! Doctor, Can I abort it?”Zhang Qingqing looked at the doctor. ”

“The doctor looked at Zhang Qingqing’s report, then he said, “This is your first child. In addition, you have a special constitution. We suggest that you don’t abort it, or it will affect the birth of a child in the future. However, this is only my suggestion. As for the specifics, you can discuss it with your boyfriend.” ”

Zhang Qingqing was stunned.

What should she do?

What should she do now?

“When she walked out of the hospital, Zhang Qingqing felt like the sky was falling. ”

“If she couldn’t abort the child, how was she going to marry Lin Ze? ”

“But if she abort the child, what if she couldn’t get pregnant in the future? ”

“After all, wealthy families were the most particular about having children! ”
