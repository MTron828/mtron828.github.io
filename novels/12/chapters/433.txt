“Chapter 434: 122: a big, hot, and domineering entrance, slapping Feng Xianxian’s face! 2”

“”Auntie, no matter how valuable it is, we can’t accept it,”another bespectacled boy said. ”

“The three of them insisted on not accepting it, so Feng Qianhua had no choice but to ask Xiao Liu to put the gifts away. ”

Old Mrs. Lin glanced at the three boys.

She felt that the three of them were somewhat unpresentable.

They were timid.

“They did not even dare to accept a gift. Even if they went to the best university in China, they would not have any great prospects in the future! ”

It was really difficult for Lin Ze to live in the same dormitory with such a person.

“Lin Ze made up the bed and came down from the top bunk. “Grandma, you can go back. There are no more problems here.” ”

“Old Mrs. Lin nodded. It just so happened that she did not want to stay here any longer. “Then call me if you have anything to say, or send a wechat message to Xiao Liu.” ”

“Okay.”

Lin Ze nodded.

...

Ye Zhuo carried the suitcase to the fifth floor.

“Along the way, she didn’t even take a deep breath. ”

It made the girls passing by look at her.

They were extremely surprised.

Ye Zhuo’s dormitory was in Room 503.

“Opening the door of the dormitory, Ye Shu said in surprise, “There’s actually a living room!” ”

“At first, she was worried that ye Zhuo wouldn’t be able to get used to living in the dormitory. ”

“She did not expect that not only was there a living room in the dormitory, but the living room was also equipped with air-conditioning. ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Beijing University is the university with the best dormitory conditions in the country. The only problem is that the admission score is too high. Otherwise, at least half of the students in China would choose Beijing University every year.” ”

Passing through the living room was the bedroom of a four-person residence.

“There was a big balcony in front of the bedroom. The lighting was very good, making people feel very comfortable at a glance. ”

The bed in the dormitory was a standard upper and lower bunk.

“The upper bunk was occupied, and the lower bunk was used to store things. ”

“At this time, although there was no one in the dormitory, the other bunks had already been occupied, leaving only the door bed unoccupied. ”

“It was probably because everyone did not like to close the door, so no one chose the door seat. ”

“Fortunately, Ye Zao was not the kind of person who cared about details. He directly dragged the luggage to the bed. “Mom, I’ll stay here.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Shu started to make the bed for ye Zao.

“Ye Zao placed the things that she needed on the table. She did not have many things. She only had a few books, a laptop, and a glass of water. ”

Then there was a mirror.

“After all, she was a beauty. She could do without anything except a mirror. ”

“If she did not have a mirror, how could she appreciate her beauty? ”

“Because ye Zao had the habit of drinking tea early in the morning, there was also a bag of unlabeled tea leaves. ”

“Compared to the other girls’tables, ye Zao’s table was extremely simple. It was even simpler than the boys’table. ”

Ye Shu made the bed and instructed ye Zao to get along well with her roommates.

“In fact, Ye Zao was very easy to get along with. However, salt could be sweet. ”

“However, ye Zao basically did not have much to say to people he was not familiar with. He was very quiet. ”

This would give people the illusion that he was very cold and aloof.

He felt that she was not easy to get along with.

“Ye Zao nodded. “Don’t worry, I know. I even prepared a small gift for my roommates.” ”

“”That’s good.”After saying that, ye Shu continued, “The bed has been made. After the bed sheet and blanket are made, bring them home once a week to wash them and disinfect them at the same time.” ”

“Okay.”

“It was already noon. Ye Zhuo continued, “Mom, do you want to go check on the food in the cafeteria?” ”

Ye Shu nodded. “Sure.”

The cafeteria of Beijing University was very big and was scattered in different areas.

“There was a buffet, a West Point restaurant, pizza, fast food, Noodle Bar... ”

There were all kinds of delicacies from all over the place.

It was good quality and cheap.

This was ye Shu’s first time entering the cafeteria on a university campus. It was completely different from what she had imagined.

She had thought that the cafeteria at university was the same as the cafeteria at junior high school. The students were all lining up at the windows to eat.

It seemed that knowledge really limited one’s horizons.

Those who had never gone to university would never know that the world of university students was also so colorful.

The outside world was a big society.

The campus was a small society.

“After eating, Ye Zao sent ye Shu to the school gate. ”

The driver was waiting for Ye Shu.

Ye Zao told the driver to drive carefully.

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “Zao Zao, you should go back quickly. Mom will send you a wechat message when she gets to the company.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

Ye Shu asked the driver to set off.

The car slowly drove on the road.

“Only when she couldn’t see Beijing University in the rearview mirror did ye Shu put down her disguise. She looked up at the driver in the front seat and said, “Little Qin, pull over at the front.” ”

“Little Qin said, “Okay.” ”

The car slowly stopped at the side of the road.

“Ye Shu continued, “Little Qin, I’ll give you half a day off today. You Don’t have to come in the afternoon. Here’s a hundred yuan. Call a car yourself and go back.” ”
