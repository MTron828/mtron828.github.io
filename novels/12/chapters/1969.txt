Translator: 549690339

The He family’s parents looked up.

“They saw a tall figure walking over. He was wearing a retro-styled long robe and had a jade-like face. His pair of cold phoenix eyes contained an infinite pressure. There was a small red mole at the corner of his eye, which added a bit of coldness. ”

“He held a string of bright red Buddhist beads in his hand, which formed a sharp contrast with his skin color. ”

“Although he didn’t do anything, just walking over here made people feel extremely pressured. ”

Who was this person?

“In a flash, father he reacted and immediately stood up to greet him. “Master Five.” ”

Master five!

Master five CEN!

“Thinking of this, Xu Yao’s eyes widened and looked in the direction of Cen Shaoqing. After knowing he ziteng for so long, this was the first time she had seen the legendary master five CEN. ”

“At this moment, there were only two words in Xu Yao’s mind. ”

Amazing!

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and lowered his eyes. “The surgery hasn’t ended yet?”

“”Not yet,”father he said. ”

“How long has it been?”Cen Shaoqing continued to ask.

“Father he replied, “Nearly twelve hours.” ”

Twelve hours?

Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly.

“After Cen Shaoqing came, the already tense atmosphere became even more tense. ”

“Cen Shaoqing was not a talkative person to begin with. If he did not speak, the others would not dare to take the initiative to speak. It was rumored that CEN fifth master’s personality was unpredictable. What if he offended this master? ”

“Fortunately, the lights in the operating theater were extinguished not long after. ”

PA —

“At this moment, the He family’s parents looked in the direction of the operating theater. ”

“Soon, the door of the operating theater was pushed open. ”

A group of people wearing white coats walked out from inside.

“Although they were all wearing white coats and masks, Cen Shaoqing still recognized ye Zhuo at a glance. ”

“The He family’s parents immediately ran over. “Doctor, Miss Ye, how was the surgery?” ”

“The director pulled down his mask and smiled. “Don’t worry. The surgery went very smoothly, but you won’t be able to see Mr. He for the time being.” ”

For the time being?

“Why?”Mother he asked.

“The director explained, “Mr. He’s current situation is special, and he needs professional care.” ”

“Then how long will it take for us to see him?”

“”About a week later.”The director added, “Although the surgery was successful, during this one week, the condition of the injury may worsen. Your family members should also be mentally prepared.” ”

“When she heard this statement a week later, Mi Chen’s eyes were full of sarcasm. ”

A week was just an excuse.

Perhaps he ziteng was already dead.

“Otherwise, the hospital would not have refused to let anyone see him, and there was no need to give the he family’s parents precautionary shots in advance so that they could be prepared in advance. ”

“Mi Chen quietly touched Xu Yao’s hand, giving her a reassuring look. ”

Xu Yao and Mi Chen looked at each other and felt relieved.

“When the he family’s parents heard what ke said, their hearts were in turmoil. ”

What should they do?

What if he ziteng could not make it through this week? What should they do?

“Xu Yao looked at the he family’s parents and comforted them, “Uncle and Auntie, don’t worry. Since the surgery has ended successfully, ziteng will definitely be able to make it through this.” ”

Mother he nodded with reddened eyes.

Cen Shaoqing walked to Ye Zhuo’s side. “Leader.”

“Seeing Cen Shaoqing, Ye Zhuo looked up in surprise. “When did you come?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing had been very busy recently, and Ye Zhuo had not seen him for almost half a month. ”

“”I just arrived.”Cen Shaoqing took the white coat that ye Zhuo took off and continued, “Are you hungry? Eat a piece of chocolate first. We’ll go out for dinner later.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and began to peel the chocolate.

“The two of them stood together, a handsome man and a beautiful woman. The scene was extremely harmonious. ”

“Seeing this scene, Xu Yao frowned slightly. ”

What was the relationship between the two of them?

Boyfriend and girlfriend?

“On this side, Ye Zhuo had just put the chocolate in his mouth when the he family’s parents walked over. ”

“Miss Ye.”

Ye Zhuo lowered his eyes slightly. “Mr. He and Mrs. He.”

“Mother he looked at ye Zao and said, “Miss Ye, can we meet with he ziteng?” ”

Ye Zao swallowed the remaining chocolate. “Maybe not now.”

“”Miss Ye, let’s just meet once. Just once is enough.”Mother he was very worried now. She wanted to take a look at he ziteng to confirm whether he ziteng was safe or not. ”

“Now that they had not seen he ziteng, the He family’s parents were very worried. ”

Ye Zhuo shook his head slightly. “We might not be able to do it now.”

“Can’t we just meet once from afar?”Xu Yao followed up with a question.
