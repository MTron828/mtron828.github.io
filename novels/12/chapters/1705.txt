Gu dening didn’t say anything.

“Gu dexin smiled and said, “”See, see! I knew you had Ye Sen in your heart.”” ”

“””I’ll Go!””Gu dening threw the flowers on the table in a fit of pique. “”What time is it in the morning?”” ”

“If she didn’t go, wouldn’t she indirectly admit that she had ye Sen in her heart? ”

“Gu dexin said, “”10:30 in the morning. 657 Hai Bin Road, sweet and Sour Cafe.”” ”

“””Got it,””gu dening said. ”

“Gu dexin instructed, “”Tomorrow, the men will go with the introducers from Beijing. Their seats are booked at 267. “”Remember to dress well. I heard that the boy is very outstanding. He’s the same age as you and is 28 years old. He graduated from Beijing University and is a local...””. . .”” ”

The Lin Manor.

Ye Shu got up early and hummed a little tune to go out.

“Ye Sen this period of time stay in the Lin family, see Ye Shu so happy, curious way: “”Elder sister, so happy ah?”” ”

“””OK,””Yeshu went on. “”By the way, let me tell you something. Didn’t Salsa’s mom set you up with someone? You say you don’t, Sha Sha mother introduced that girl to Chujie again. “”Let me take Chu Jie to Sweet Noel Cafe to meet the girl later.”” ”

“””Sweet Noel Cafe? What a coincidence!””Ye Sen said in surprise. ”

“””You’re going too?””Ye Shu asked. ”

“Ye Sen nodded. “”I have an appointment with a client over there to discuss a collaboration.”” ”

“””What Time Are You There?””Ye Shu asked. ”

“Ye Sen said, “”9:30.”” ”

“Ye Shu nodded. “”Okay, I Won’t talk to you. I’m going to Chu Jie’s first. It’s my first time meeting the girl, so I have to buy a bouquet of flowers.”” ”

In the Sweet Cafe.

“At 10:25 am, Gu Dening arrived at the cafe. ”

Ye Shu had already brought Chu Jie to his seat.

“Chu Jie’s father was an old friend of Lin Jincheng, and Chu Jie was 28 years old and alone. His parents were very anxious, so they asked ye Shu to find a girlfriend for Chu Jie. ”

“Ye Shu looked at Chu Jie with a smile. “”I heard that the woman is very outstanding. She’s a doctor and is very good-looking. Chu Jie, if you think she’s good, you can take the initiative to ask for wechat later.”” ”

“””Okay.””Chu Jie nodded. ”

“Not long after, a figure in a blue dress appeared in her line of sight. ”

“Ye Shu said, “”She’s wearing a blue dress and holding a black backpack in her hand. It should be that girl.”” ”

Chu Jie adjusted his glasses and looked up.

“As the figure got closer and closer, ye Shu felt that this person was more and more familiar. In the next second, Ye Shu stood up from the chair. “”De Ning!”” ”

“””Mrs. Lin.””Seeing ye Shu, Gu De Ning was a little surprised. ”

“Ye Shu continued, “”De Ning! You’re not the girl that Sha Sha introduced, are you?”” ”

“Gu De Ning also reacted at this time. “”Chu Jie?”” ”

“Chu Jie, who was standing at the side, stood up and nodded politely. “”I’m Chu Jie.”” ”

“Ye Shu continued, “”Since we know each other, then it’s Easy! De Ning, take a seat! Oh right, Chu Jie, this is Gu De Ning. I’ve known her before too.”” ”

“After saying that, Ye Shu turned to look at Gu De Ning. “”De Ning, this is Chu Jie. You should know about Chu Jie’s situation.”” ”

Gu De Ning nodded.

“Chu Jie handed the menu to Gu De Ning. “”What would miss gu like to drink?”” ”

“””I’d like a glass of lemonade,””gu de Ning said. ”

“Chu Jie called the waiter over. “”A glass of lemonade.”” ”

“””Yes, sir. Please wait a moment.”” ”

Ye Sen and the client came out of the private room and saw ye Shu and Chu Jie sitting by the window.

“Then, he saw a familiar profile. ”

“Gu, Gu De Ning? ”

What was going on?

Was he hallucinating?

“Seeing ye Sen like this, the client said, “”CEO Ye, what are you looking at?”” ”

“Ye Sen continued, “”I’m sorry, CEO Tang. I saw an acquaintance, so I went over to greet him.”” ”

“Chief Tang said, “”Then you should go over quickly!”” ”

“Ye Sen walked over. “”Sis.”” ”

“””Ye Sen.””ye Shu turned around and smiled. “”Ye Sen, isn’t this a coincidence? So the girl that Sha Sha introduced to Chu Jie is De Ning.”” ”

Gu De Ning!

Ye Sen was stunned.

The blind date that Zhou Yuelian introduced to him was actually gu de Ning!

“If he knew that this person was Gu de Ning, then ye Sen would definitely not reject it. ”

Regret.

Very much regret.

Ye Sen’s heart instantly felt like a million grass mud horses galloping past him. He wished he could travel back in time to a few days ago and beat that stupid self to death.

“If he had not rejected the blind date, then the person sitting opposite gu deling would be him now. ”

“However, Ye Sen’s face could not show even the slightest bit of it. He tried his best to smile. “”That’s too much of a coincidence!”” ”Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com
