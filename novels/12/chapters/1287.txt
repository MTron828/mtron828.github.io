“”For you to see? Do you have a search warrant?”Mike continued, “What right do you have to search my bag?” ”

“Ye Zao was too lazy to waste his breath on him. He narrowed his eyes and turned his hand into a claw. Just like that, he grabbed Mike’s shoulder and quickly extended his other hand toward Mike’s face. ”

This scene happened too quickly.

“Mike almost couldn’t react. Seeing that the hand was about to reach over, Mike tilted his head and raised his foot to kick forward. ”

Dust flew everywhere.

This scene stunned everyone.

Unfortunately.

It was too slow.

Mike’s speed was really too slow.

Ye Zao directly gave a back kick.

Bang.

“Mike was thrown to the ground just like that, his face pale. ”

It hurt.

It was too painful.

It hurt so much that Mike’s tears came out.

“Mike had debuted for so many years, but he had never suffered such a loss! ”

“Until he fell to the ground, he was still wondering if this scene was an illusion. ”

He lost.

He actually lost to a little girl.

Unbelievable.

It was simply unbelievable.

“”Miss Ye!”Officer Yin walked to Ye Zao’s side. “You, this, he, isn’t He Wang Hai? I just checked Wang Hai’s information, he doesn’t have any illegal records...” ”

Although ye Zao’s attacks just now were indeed quite cool. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

But Wang Hai didn’t do anything illegal after all...

“If ye Zao acted rashly, Wang Hai had the right to pursue his legal responsibility. ”

“”He is Mike Williams,”ye Zao said. ”

“Officer Yin continued, “But Mike Williams is not from C Nation! This Wang Hai is from China.” ”

Captain Li was also puzzled.

“”I told you, Mike Williams is a big shot in disguise.”Ye Zao’s expression was indifferent. He walked to Mike’s side, bent down slightly, and reached out to touch Mike’s cheek. ”

A big shot in disguise?

“But even with makeup, it was impossible to completely change a person’s appearance. ”

Mike Williams was from C Nation.

Could it be that foreigners could disguise themselves as Chinese?

It seemed a little unbelievable.

“Officer Yin looked at captain Li and continued, “What is Miss ye doing?” ”

Captain Li shook his head.

“Although ye Zao was only a little girl, he stood in front of ye Zao and never saw through Ye Zao’s thoughts. ”

“Moreover, Captain Li had never dared to treat ye Zao as a little girl. ”

RIP —

“In the next second, a human skin mask was torn off just like that. ”

“A golden-haired, blue-eyed, three-dimensional facial features appeared in front of everyone. ”

Wang Hai just now seemed to have disappeared into thin air.

This scene stunned everyone.

“Officer Yin immediately turned on his phone and exclaimed, “Oh my God! It’s the same! It’s exactly the same! He looks exactly like Mike Williams! Oh My God! Captain Li, Look!” ”

Captain Li walked over with a look of surprise on his face.

It was exactly the same.

No one expected that Mike Williams was wearing a human skin mask.

“Officer Yin picked up the handcuffs. “You can’t run away now, can you? !” ”

Click —

The cold handcuffs were handcuffed to Mike’s wrist.

“From the beginning to the end, Mike just looked at Ye Zao. ”

“He never dreamed that one day, it would fall into the hands of a little girl. ”

“If it was traced to his location, it was because someone was pointing at ye Zao behind his back. ”

But just now?

When did ye Zao actually fight.

Who was Mike?

An assassin!

And an international assassin.

“In terms of fighting, he had never lost. ”

But now...

He actually lost to a little girl.

“Until now, Mike had no idea how he lost. ”

What the hell was going on?

Mike was taken to a police car.

Sirens sounded everywhere.

Mike was not an ordinary criminal.

He was one of the top ten killers in the International Martial Arts World.

What did the top ten mean?

A bounty of 20 million dollars!

Thousands of top bounty hunters around the world failed to capture Mike.

“And now, the Chinese police had captured an international assassin. This news quickly caused a sensation in the international media. ”

A large number of reporters came to interview Captain Li’s police station.

International organizations sent the Chinese police a sky-high commission.

Captain Li was nominated by the higher-ups for praise.

“For a time, captain Li became a popular person in the police station. ”

“Captain Li felt guilty. “Chief Liu, it’s all Miss Ye’s credit. These honors belong to Miss Ye. They have nothing to do with me.” ”

“If it weren’t for Ye Zhuo, they would have let Mike go a long time ago. ”

“Chief Liu patted captain Li’s shoulder, “Old Li, all these years, your hard work has been seen by the higher-ups. Miss ye is a person who doesn’t care about fame and fortune. She never cares about these things. As long as you keep this love in your heart, it’s fine.” ”
