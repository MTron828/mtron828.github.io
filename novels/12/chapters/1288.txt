“”But, but I can’t do this...” ”

“Chief Liu continued, “The reason we were able to capture Mike this time was because you cooperated well. Also, do you know Miss Ye’s identity?” ”

“What identity?”Chief Li asked.

“Chief Liu said, “Reach out your hand.” ”

Captain Li reached out his hand.

Chief Liu wrote two words on Captain Li’s hand.

Captain Li looked at chief Liu in surprise. “S3?”

“Yes.”Chief Liu nodded.

Captain Li gulped.

He had never expected that ye Zao was actually a S3 person.

No Wonder Ye Zao was so powerful.

“If he had not seen it with his own eyes, who would believe that such a young girl would have the S3 title. ”

“Chief Liu patted captain Li on the shoulder. “So, don’t deny it! Actually, this is also Miss Ye’s idea. If you don’t believe it, you can go ask Miss ye yourself.” ”

Captain Li nodded.

The news of Mike’s arrest also blew up the entire assassin world and the Bounty Hunter Circle.

Who would have thought that Mike would eventually be caught in China.

“Moreover, he was caught by the Chinese police! ”

“Ye Zhuo sat in front of the computer desk, logged into his long-lost account, and opened the international jianghu hunting warrant. ”

“On the jianghu hunting warrant, Mike’s name had already disappeared. ”

The entire forum was discussing this matter.

Because Mike was the first and only person to be arrested by the police.

“Closing the forum, Ye Zhuo opened the hunting warrant and unexpectedly found that An’s name had actually changed from sixth to third place. ”

The bounty went from 10 billion to 30 billion.

Ye Zao curled his lips slightly.

It was always yaler who increased the bounty.

“Seeing her bounty go up, Ye Zao raised her eyebrows slightly. She had a very serious obsessive-compulsive disorder. ”

Either she was ranked in the bottom five.

Or she was ranked first.

It was neither high nor low. It was uncomfortable to watch.

“After thinking for a while, ye Zao pressed the add button and changed the 30 billion to 100 billion. ” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

An’s ranking went from third to first.

“Then, ye Zao added the bounty for Hacker Z. ”

“Hence, Hu. ”

The first place on the kill list was An.

Second place was z.

A family had to be neat and tidy to look good.

“After ye Zao’s provocative actions, the entire forum exploded. ”

[ hurry up to the ranking list! This is amazing! God of gamblers An and hacker z must have offended someone! And not just one person! ]

[ the bounty on An’s side must have been added by Yaler. They must have found An after making yaler and the others suffer so much at Rani Duan. ]

[ Yaler’s Yue League is too trashy! They can’t even find a little girl. ]

“[ who’s a little girl? ]? An? Stop talking nonsense. I have insider information. I heard that An is a 500-pound fatty! He can kill a person with a single slap. He’s so powerful! Otherwise, if Yala couldn’t find him, why would he issue a bounty ”

“[ F * CK, 500 pounds! Is that true? I don’t read much. Don’t try to fool me! ] ”

“[ it’s true! When An ascended to godhood in ranito casino, I was there. Let’s not talk about 500 pounds! There must be 600 pounds! ] ”

“[500 catties, it’s solid! ] ”

“[ F * ck! F * ck! With such a nice name, I thought An was a peerless beauty. I didn’t expect her to be a peerless fat pig. 500 catties? None of the pigs in my farm are this fat! ] ”

[ looks and weight are not important. This is not a beauty contest. What’s important is that she’s powerful! She can ascend to godhood with a bet and even fool a super big shot like Yaler. Can you do it? ]

“[ the conclusion from upstairs is very correct. Even if she weighs 500 pounds, she can still hold a young hunk in her left hand and a muscular man in her right hand. ] ”

“[ to be honest, I want to be the man in An’s arms! ] ”

[ ... ]

PA!

Carl directly threw away the mouse in his hand.

Damn it.

It was simply too damn.

These people actually dared to say that about An.

Was An clearly a peerless beauty?

Carl picked up his phone and dialed the number.

“The call was picked up quickly, and his voice was as clear as ever. “What’s Wrong?” ”

“”An, have you seen the Forum? Those people are crazy! They all say that you’re a 500-pound Fatty!” ”

“Compared to the agitated Carl, ye Zhuo was extremely calm. “Their mouths are on their bodies, so let them say whatever they want.” ”

“”But, but aren’t you angry?”Carl said indignantly. ”

“Do you have anything else?”Ye Zao continued to ask.

“Carl continued, “I don’t know who is so wicked and added your bounty. An, your bounty has already been increased to 100 billion! If this continues, sooner or later, it will attract the White Shadow’s attention.” ”
