“”Wait for you to discuss it with me? Wait for you to discuss it with me. It’s already too late!”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “I’ve seen it. The 18th is a good day. Go and ask burning. Can We go to her house on the 18th?” ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Old Mrs. Cen took out a piece of red paper and handed it to Cen Shaoqing. “This is the auspicious day that I asked the fortune teller to pick for you. When the time comes, let your father-in-law, mother-in-law take a look. The day they set the date is the day.” ”

Cen Shaoqing took the red paper.

There were a total of three days on it.

“They were all six months later, and the days were very close. ”

“Do you have any questions?”Old Mrs. Cen asked.

Cen Shaoqing shook his head slightly. “I don’t have any questions.”

“”That’s good.”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Then that’s it. You can ask burning. I’ll go upstairs and Sleep First!” ”

“”Good night,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

The next morning.

At the Lin family home.

Ye Zhuo mentioned this matter to his parents at the dining table.

“Lin Jincheng said, “Alright, get old Mrs. Cen to come over on the 18th.” ”

“After saying that, Lin Jincheng seemed to have thought of something. He turned to look at Lin Ze and Bai Jingshu. “Can the two of you make it back before the 18th?” ”

Setting a date was a big deal.

“As brother and sister-in-law, Lin Ze and Bai Jingshu had to be at home. ”

“Bai Jingshu said, “It’s only the 6th today. We should be home by the 17th.” ”

“”That’s good.”Lin Jincheng continued, “You guys are leaving tomorrow, right?” ”

“Bai Jingshu nodded. “Yes, Dad.” ”

“At this moment, ye Shu brought over a bowl of bird’s nest. “Come, Jingshu, have some bird’s nest. I specially asked the kitchen to boil it.” ”

Bai Jingshu ate everything except bird’s nest.

She always felt that bird’s nest had a fishy smell.

“When she found out that bird’s nest was the saliva of a swallow, it became even harder to swallow. ”

“”Mom, I Can’t drink it.”Bai Jingshu shook her head. ”

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “Drinking bird’s nest now is good for you and the child.” ”

“Drinking bird’s nest is good for the child?”Bai Jingshu’s eyes immediately lit up.

“Ye Shu nodded. “That’s right. I heard that not only can it improve a pregnant woman’s skin, but it can also make the baby’s Skin Fair and tender when it’s born.” ”

“Bai Jingshu turned to look at ye Zao. “Zaozao, is that really the case?” ”

Ye Zao nodded slightly. “I think that’s the case.”

“Upon hearing this, Bai Jingshu immediately said, “Mom, give it to me quickly!” ”

She could finish three bowls of it!

“Ye Shu passed the bird’s nest to Bai Jingshu, who finished it in one gulp. ”

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “Remember to drink it every day from now on.” ”

“Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded.

“For the sake of having beautiful children in the future, she had to persevere. ”

The next day.

Bai Jingshu and Lin ze set off for the s galaxy.

“After arriving at the s galaxy, Bai Jingshu and Lin Ze went straight to the Bai family’s old residence. ”

“The Bai family’s parents had heard from God knows where that the two of them had returned home, so they shamelessly came over. ”

They were thoroughly scolded by Elder Bai.

“Left with no choice, the Bai family’s parents went back dejectedly. ”

Elder Bai stood in front of the main door and welcomed Bai Jingshu and Lin Ze.

“Soon, an aircraft landed at the door. ”

Elder Bai immediately walked over. “Jingshu! Ah Ze!”

“Grandpa.”Bai Jingshu hugged elder Bai.

“Elder Bai’s eyes were slightly red. He patted Bai Jingshu’s back and turned to look at Lin Ze. “Come, come, come! Quickly enter the house!” ”

Lin Ze followed elder Bai’s footsteps.

The three of them walked into the house together.

“After entering the house, elder Bai looked at Bai Jingshu and said, “Jingshu, you told me in your message that you have something to tell me. What Happened?” ”

“Ever since he received Bai Jingshu’s message, Old Master Bai had been looking forward to Bai Jingshu’s return, but at the same time, he was also a little worried. ”

“He was looking forward to seeing Bai Jingshu earlier, worried that she had encountered something that couldn’t be resolved and was still having conflicts with her in-laws. ”

“”There is something that I have to tell you. Otherwise, we wouldn’t have decided to come back so quickly.” ”
