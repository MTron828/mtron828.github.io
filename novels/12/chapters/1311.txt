“Zheng wanyin said, “In any case, sister-in-law is the main assessment officer.” ”

“Xie Wanqiu’s eyes darted around. “If that’s the case, this will also be of help to you!” ”

“What help?”Zheng Wanyin asked.

“Xie wanqiu said, “Let me ask you, does the main assessment officer have a lot of power?” ”

“Quite a lot.”Zheng Wanyin nodded.

“The corners of Xie Wanqiu’s mouth curled up into a smile. “Yinyin, haven’t you always wanted to get promoted to 3A?” ”

“Zheng wanyin said speechlessly, “Grandma, do you think that I can get promoted just by thinking about it? There are more than 50 people participating in the assessment this time, and all of them are core members! It’s already not bad if I can get promoted to 2A!” ”

Zheng Wanyin was very clear about her own strength.

“Although she was very powerful and promising at a young age, there were many members in the ABA who were more powerful than her. ”

“However, Zheng Wanyin was still very confident about getting promoted to 2a. ”

“She was still young now. First, she would get promoted to 2A, and then to 3A. There was still a long way to go in the future. ”

“Xie wanqiu patted Zheng Wanyin’s hand. “You Silly Child, why don’t you learn to be more mindful?” ”

“”Grandma, haven’t you heard that silly people are blessed with silly luck?” ”

“Xie wanqiu smiled and said, “Other people don’t have connections and think of ways to look for connections. You, on the other hand, have a ready-made connection and still don’t know how to use it!” ”

“Since ye Zhuo was the main assessment officer, he definitely had a lot of power. ”

What was helping Zheng Wanyin get promoted to 3A?

Zheng Wanyin frowned. “Grandma... What You Mean Is? Look for... look for cousin-in-law?”

“Yes.”Xie wanqiu nodded.

“”No,”Zheng Wanyin rejected directly. “It’s unfair to the other members. Grandma, I can’t Do That! Don’t go find cousin-in-law!” ”

“”This society is unfair in the first place. “Why are some people born to be nobles who don’t have to worry about food and clothing all their lives, and some people who have eaten the last meal but haven’t eaten the next?”Xie wanqiu continued, “Being able to find connections is also a kind of strength!” ”

They could not find connections and could only blame themselves for not having the strength and resources to do so.

Can you blame the heavens and blame the people?

“After saying that, Xie wanqiu continued, “This matter has been decided. I’ll go look for Zhou Xiang now.” ”

“Grandma! No Way!”Zheng Wanyin grabbed Xie Wanqiu’s hand. “I can’t do this!”

“Xie wanqiu frowned. “Yinyin, you’re not even listening to me now?” ”

“”No, Grandma. I just feel that it’s not good to do this. Not only is it unfair to others, but it’s also irresponsible to myself. Although I really want to get into the Triple A, I want to get into the triple A through my hard work, not through the back door.” ”

“”You have to have strength and looks. What kind of back door is this?”Xie wanqiu continued, “Even if you don’t use the back door, others will!” ”

Zheng Wanyin sighed. There was no expression on her face.

That’s right.

This was the current society.

She had no choice.

“Xie wanqiu continued, “Yinyin, Grandma knows that you’re a good child. This is the current world. Everyone eats people. Even if you don’t eat people, others will eat you. “Alright, Go prepare for the assessment!” ”

Zheng Wanyin nodded and walked towards the preparation room.

Everyone was in the preparation room.

“I heard that there’s a new chief assessment officer this year. I’m not sure if he’s strict or not.”

“”The CEO invited him personally. I don’t know if he’s strict or not, but the standards will definitely be high.” ”

“”Bodhisattva, please bless me. I must get into 3A.” ”

“Zheng Wanyin walked in and asked curiously, “How many places in 3A this year?” ”

“The short-haired girl replied, “Six for 3A, ten for 2A, and 15 for 1A.” ”

“After she said that, the short-haired girl added, “Including the HI side, there are a total of 105 people. How can this number be enough for us!” ”

There were only 31 slots in total.

“Zheng wanyin said, “Indeed, it’s not enough. Don’t think too much about it. Do your best and leave it to fate.” ”

The short-haired girl shrugged. “That’s all we can do now. I’m afraid it would be great if I knew the main examiner today! It’s a pity that we don’t have such a big backer.”

Zheng Wanyin’s beautiful eyes sparkled.

It looked like.

Xie Wanqiu was right.

“Actually, everyone wanted to use a backdoor. ”

It was just that they didn’t have any connections.

Sigh.

People nowadays!

“Zheng Wanyin sighed in her heart. She looked up at the short-haired girl and said with a smile, “Don’t think that way. If you really used a backdoor, wouldn’t it be unfair to other people who are truly capable?” ”

“The short-haired girl smiled and said, “I was just saying it casually. Did you really take it seriously? In your heart, am I that kind of person?” ”
