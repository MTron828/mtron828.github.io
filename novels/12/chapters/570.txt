“Even an ordinary family wouldn’t be able to pick up the food on the floor and eat it, right?”

Zhao shuning frowned and slammed the chopsticks in her hand onto the table.

She didn’t understand why Lin Qingxuan always went against her! RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“He didn’t find it disgusting to pick up the food on the floor and eat it, but she did!”

It was degrading.

It was too degrading!

“At this moment, footsteps came from outside the house.”

“”Fourth brother, fourth sister-in-law is eating?””

Zhao shuning glanced sideways and saw that it was Lin Jincheng. His eyes were filled with anger. “Why are you here?”

“Lin Jincheng smiled and said, “My leg has been a little uncomfortable these few days. I made an appointment with fourth brother last night and asked him to accompany me to the hospital today to take a look.””

“After saying this, Lin Jincheng looked at Lin Qingxuan again. “Fourth brother, don’t tell me you’ve forgotten about what happened last night so quickly?””

“Actually, Lin Jincheng was a little flustered at this moment.”

He was afraid that Lin Qingxuan would be the same as last night and would never agree to go to the hospital.

“”I haven’t forgotten.”Lin Qingxuan raised her head and looked at Lin Jincheng. “After we finish eating breakfast, I’ll go with you.””

“In the past 21 years, he had never done anything to let Zhao shuning down.”

“But this time, he wanted to do it again.”

“If the result of the examination was still his fault, he would bring the certificate to Zhao Shuning and apologize.”

“”Okay.”Lin Jincheng’s eyes lit up and he immediately said, “Then I’ll wait for you in the East Wing.””

“Okay.”Lin Qingxuan nodded.

Zhao shuning narrowed her eyes.

She didn’t like Lin Qingxuan to get too close.

“As the saying goes, those who are in the middle are confused, and those who are watching from the sidelines are clear.”

She was afraid that Lin Jincheng would eventually notice something.

After all.

Lin Jincheng was a rare smart person.

“Lin Qingxuan gave up her first love because of Old Lady Lin’s words, but Lin Jincheng couldn’t.”

But Li Yibiao was coming over soon.

“At this time, it was good that Lin Jincheng wasn’t at the Lin residence.”

“If Lin Jincheng was at home, there would definitely be more trouble.”

“Unexpectedly, Lin Qingxuan had unintentionally facilitated this matter.”

“Zhao shuning continued eating the porridge. He guessed that Li Yibiao would be coming soon, so he said, “Since you’ve already made an appointment, then hurry up and go! Don’t let Jincheng wait too long!””

Lin Qingxuan nodded. “I know.”

“After breakfast, Lin Qingxuan went to the east wing to look for Lin Jin city.”

The east wing was not as lively as the north wing.

“The east wing was very lively, and the atmosphere was warm.”

“At this moment, Ye Zhuo and Lin Ze were sitting on a small wooden chair in front of the courtyard, chatting about something. The wooden shelf above their heads was blooming with colorful roses, and the smiling faces of the brother and sister were covered in flowers. They were eighteen or nineteen-year-old teenagers.., the colors were even more beautiful than fresh flowers. When they saw Lin Qingxuan come in, Ye Zhuo and Lin Ze hurriedly stood up to call for her.”

“Fourth uncle.”

“Lin Qingxuan’s face unconsciously raised into a smile. “Ah Ze, Zhuo Zhuo.””

Ye Shu walked out from inside. “Fourth brother is here. Jin Cheng is in the back room taking a call. Take a seat first.”

“Okay.”Lin Qingxuan nodded and bent down to sit opposite Lin Ze and ye Zhuo.

Ye Shu brought over a cup of tea.

“”Thank you, sister-in-law.””

“”Fourth brother, you’re too polite.””

“After a while, Lin Jincheng came out of the back room. “Fourth brother, let’s go.””

“Okay.”Lin Qingxuan stood up from the stool.

“”Wait a moment,”ye Shu said from the side.”

“What’s Wrong?”Lin Jincheng turned his head.

Ye Shu walked over and put her hands on his tie. She lowered her eyebrows and carefully tidied up the messy tie.

“Although it was just a simple action, Lin Jincheng was stunned.”

His breathing was chaotic.

His heart was racing.

“When Lin Qingxuan saw this scene, she suddenly felt envious of Lin Jincheng.”

He and Zhao shuning seemed to have never been so warm before.

Many times.

Zhao shuning used Lin Qingxuan as a servant and ordered her around.

“She was already used to Lin Qingxuan’s efforts, so she naturally wouldn’t do anything for Lin Qingxuan.”

“”Alright.”Ye Shu loosened her tie and continued, “Be careful on the road.””

“Okay.”Lin Jincheng nodded and left with Lin Qingxuan.

The Black Bentley quickly disappeared on the road.

...

On the other side.

Zhao shuning also came to Old Lady Lin’s courtyard.

“Old Lady Lin had just woken up when Zhao shuning took over the maid’s job, helping her brush her teeth and wash her face.”

“Looking at Zhao shuning who was doing her best, Old Mrs. Lin suddenly felt a little guilty. “Shuning, all these years, it’s our Lin family that has let you down.”They were also from the Zhao family, zhao shuning was also old Mrs. Lin’s daughter-in-law, and she had always favored Zhao shuning a little more.”

“In addition, Lin Jincheng was infertile. All these years, Zhao shuning had been the only one who had blocked the gossip outside.”
