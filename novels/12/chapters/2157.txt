“”Thank you, Miss Duanmu.”MAN XING continued, “Miss DUANMU, you can just call me by my name from now on.” ”

“”Okay.”At this moment, Duanmu Feng had completely let down her guard. She continued, “Then you can also call me by my name.” ”

“”I don’t dare.”Man Xing said gently, “Father taught me since I was young that there is an order between seniority and respect. Miss DUANMU, you are the most honorable woman in the S Galaxy. How can I call you by your name without distinguishing between seniority and respect? This is not proper etiquette.” ”

This sentence pleased Duanmu fengyu very much.

Duanmu Fengyu was also very satisfied with man Xing.

“She had thought that man Xing was a scheming woman, but it seemed that she was overthinking it. Man Xing was not a threat to her. ”

“Man Xing looked at Duanmu Fengyu and curled his lips slightly. “Miss Duanmu, in fact, I always thought that you were a very cold and aloof person, so I didn’t dare to speak much in front of you. I didn’t expect you to be so amiable.” ”

“”Is that so?”Duanmu feng smiled and said, “Actually, I’m just like you. I only know how to be cold and aloof in front of people I don’t know.” ”

The two young girls soon got along well.

“Not long after, Cen Haifeng and the Cen family appeared at the family identification banquet. ”

“Looking at the old Mrs. Cen with her gorgeous hair, man Xing’s eyes narrowed slightly. ”

“Perhaps in the eyes of others, she was just an old lady from Earth who was useless, but man Xing didn’t think so. She respected the elderly and liked to be with them. ”

“Man Xing lifted his skirt, but at this time, he accidentally broke the ornament on his wrist. ”

Clatter.

Emerald Green beads fell on the ground.

“However, this slight movement did not attract the attention of others in the banquet hall. Even man Xing himself did not notice it. ”

“Old Lady Cen hated to attend such boring banquets, but she had to clear ye Zao’s name. She could only brace herself and turn around to see when ye Zao would come. Suddenly, she stepped on something and almost fell, at the most critical moment, a pair of hands firmly supported her. ”

“A caring and gentle voice sounded above her head, “Are you okay, Old Lady?” ”

Old Mrs. Cen raised her head and saw an extremely beautiful face.

“If she did not know ye Zao, Old Mrs. Cen would definitely be shocked. However, after knowing ye Zao, even a beautiful person would not be able to excite her. ”

“If one were to describe it in one sentence, it would be that after ye Zao, there would be no more beautiful women. ”

“”Thank you.”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “I’m fine.” ”

“”You’re too polite, old lady,”man Xing continued. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen Glanced at man Xing and continued, “Young Lady, what is your name?” ” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“”My Name is man Xing,”man Xing said, “Man of Gold and Jade, the Sun, Moon, and stars.” ”

Old Mrs. Cen nodded. “Your name is very nice. I think you must be the apple of your eye in the family.”

“Man Xing shook his head. “No, I have an elder sister called man Yue.” ”

“The Sun, Moon, and stars, of course, were in front of the Moon. ”

This sentence also indirectly told old Mrs. Cen that she was not a spoiled little princess. She was just a daughter of an ordinary family.

“Then your sister must be as beautiful as you.”Old Mrs. Cen raised her head.

“MAN XING said humbly, “My sister is much more beautiful than me. I can’t even compare to half of her.” ”

Old Mrs. Cen was a little curious when she heard this.

Not even half.

Then how beautiful would the full moon be

“After saying this, man Xing continued, “Speaking of which, Miss Ye and my eldest sister have some sort of relationship.” ”

“Yezi?”Old Mrs. Cen asked.

“Old Mrs. Cen continued asking, “What kind of relationship?” ”

“MAN XING said, “Although I’ve never seen eldest sister before, I still feel that she looks very similar to eldest sister. When I see her, it’s as if I see eldest sister.” ”

“As he spoke, he saw that old Mrs. Cen was holding a piece of dessert in her hand. MAN XING also picked up the dessert on the table and said with a smile, “I like to eat dessert the most. Unfortunately, it’s very hard to get these in the S Galaxy.” ”

“You like to eat this?”A look of surprise flashed across the old lady’s face.

These desserts were specially added by Cen Hai Feng.

“In the S Galaxy, these were all meaningless food. No one would eat them. ”

“Just the composition of a drop of nutrient solution was higher than that of an entire cake. Moreover, the nutrient solution contained various energy elements. ”

“”Yes.”MAN XING smiled and said, “I may have been a freak since I was born. “I like to eat things that others don’t like. Although they all think that this kind of food is redundant, I don’t think so. In ancient times, if it weren’t for this kind of food, there wouldn’t have been our ancestors. “Food doesn’t have three, six, or nine grades. We should have a heart of reverence for food, not to spoil it, and not to abandon it.” ”
