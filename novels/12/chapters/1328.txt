“Actually, Zheng Wanyin was not a bad person. ”

It was just that sometimes she did not consider all aspects of the problem.

“If she had not made the matter of the assessment so big, things would not have turned out this way. ”

Zhou Xiang nodded. “Okay.”

Zheng Wanyin thought that Zhou Xiang would say that she did not need to apologize to Ye Zhuo.

She didn’t expect...

Zhou Xiang actually nodded.

Maybe.

Xie Wanqiu was right.

“In Zhou Xiang’s heart, there was no such thing as a niece. ”

“But thinking about it, it was normal. ”

“After all, she wasn’t related to Zhou Xiang by blood. ”

She didn’t blame Zhou Xiang.

“If she were Zhou Xiang, she might not be as good as Zhou Xiang. ”

If she had to blame.

It was her fault that she wasn’t as good as Ye Zhuo in reincarnating!

“If she were ye Zhuo, she would not have these worries. ”

No wonder there was an idiom.

A mediocre person bothers themselves.

“In the past, she had never known what kind of person a mediocre person was. ”

“Now, she finally understood. ”

So a mediocre person referred to people like her.

“Zheng wanyin continued, “Second aunt, I’m sorry to have disturbed you for so many days with Grandma. Don’t worry, I’ll think of a way to bring grandma back as soon as possible.” ”

Zhou Xiang patted Zheng Wanyin’s hand. “You’re my family. It doesn’t matter how many days you stay here. It’s too polite to say such things.”

“”Second aunt, thank you.” ”

“”Silly Child, why are you being so polite with me?” ”

“Half an hour later, they lined up smoothly and paid the hospital fees. ”

“Just as they paid the fees, Zhou Xiang’s phone rang. ”

“Seeing the caller ID, Zhou Xiang’s scalp went numb. ”

It was a call from her father.

“Perhaps it was because her mother had passed away early, Zhou Xiang was not close to her father. She could not even compare to Zheng Wanyin’s mother. ”

“When she was very young, Zhou Xiang had subconsciously thought that they were the real family of three. ”

And she and her brother were just outsiders.

“Moreover, Father Zhou was very strict. He followed the principle of having a filial son under the baton. When he started to fight, he did not show any mercy. ”

“Even Zhou Xiang, this girl, received a lot of beatings when she was young. ”

“”Dad.”Although she did not want to pick up the call, Zhou Xiang still picked up. ”

“”Dad! You still have the face to call me dad! Tell me, how did your mother get hospitalized? How did you anger your mother into the hospital?”Father Zhou’s voice was very angry. ”

He was really angry.

“Although father Zhou and Xie wanqiu were a half-married couple, they were truly in love! ”

“It was said that it was not easy to be a stepmother. Therefore, when Xie Wanqiu first married into the Zhou family, he had been educating the Zhou siblings, telling them not to be mischievous and not to let their new mother worry. ”

“Even so, the siblings had always made Xie wanqiu worry. ”

So...

Father Zhou had always been very grateful to Xie wanqiu. He was grateful that she had raised his two children as if they were her own children.

But Zhou Xiang was fine.

“Not only did she not know how to show filial piety to Xie wanqiu, she had even angered Xie wanqiu to the hospital. ”

Was there such a daughter in the world?

Father Zhou wished he could slap this unfilial daughter of his to death.

“Zhou Xiang explained, “Father, you’ve misunderstood. Things are not what you think at all...” ”

“On the other end of the phone, Father Zhou sighed deeply, “Xiang Xiang, your mother left early. If it wasn’t for wanqiu, would there still be you and your brother? You have to learn to be grateful! “Don’t make your mother angry so easily. Although Wanqiu isn’t your real mother, you have to ask yourself, since you were young, how has she mistreated you and your brother? “I’m already so old. Who knows, I might go one day. Can you bear to look at your father at such an old age? After closing your eyes, are you still worried about your mother?” ”

“In father Zhou’s heart, Xie Wanqiu was a great wife. ”

She had sacrificed her entire youth for the Zhou family and his two children.

“At this point.., father Zhou continued, “And your sister. If it wasn’t for you, would your sister have left us so early? “Think about it carefully. All these years, has your mother ever blamed you? “For the sake of our family, your mother has always been quietly swallowing her anger. Now that she’s old, as a child, why can’t you let your mother enjoy more happiness!” ”

“Through the phone, Zhou Xiang could not be bothered to explain anything to Father Zhou. She continued, “I understand.” ”

“Father Zhou continued, “Xiang Xiang, you must remember my words. You must not let your mother suffer any more grievances! Otherwise, treat it as if I don’t have a daughter like you in the future!”At the end of his sentence, Father Zhou directly said something fierce. ”

“Zhou Xiang took a deep breath. “Father, what kind of grievances do you think I can make her suffer?”The one who was suffering was obviously her, but Father Zhou had lectured her without any reason. She just could not refute him. ”

“Forget it, forget it. ”

“Anyway, she was already married. ”

“Even if Xie wanqiu could be tormented, could she still be tormented in the CEN family for the rest of her life? ”

“After hanging up the phone, Zheng Wanyin asked, “Second aunt, is it grandpa who called?” ”

Zhou Xiang nodded slightly.

“Zheng Wanyin’s expression did not look good, she asked carefully, “Did Grandpa Misunderstand You? Don’t worry, when I go back, I will explain to Grandpa! All of this is my problem, it has nothing to do with you!” ”

“Zhou xiang continued, “I know you are a good child. This is a problem between your Grandpa and me. You are a child, you don’t need to interfere in the affairs of adults.” ”

“”Second aunt, I’m sorry...”Zheng Wanyin’s face was full of guilt. ”

“Silly child. Second aunt is fine.”Zhou Xiang patted Zheng Wanyin’s shoulder.

“Zheng Wanyin turned around and hugged Zhou Xiang. She said emotionally, “Second aunt, thank you.” ”

...

Zhou Xiang stayed in the hospital until the night before she was free to go home.

“As soon as she returned home, old Mrs. Cen asked, “Where’s Xie Wanqiu? Did she go back?” ”

“If she really did go back, she would have to buy some fireworks and firecrackers to celebrate. ”

“Not yet.”Zhou Xiang shook his head.

“When she heard the word ‘not yet’, the smile on Old Mrs. Cen’s face disappeared completely. “She didn’t go back! Great! She’s going to go through all that again, right?” ”

Zhou Xiang nodded.

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “What new tricks did she come up with?” ”

Zhou Xiang looked a little troubled. “She’s in the hospital.”

“In the hospital?”Old Mrs. Cen narrowed her eyes. “What’s wrong with her? Can she still be cured?”

Zhou Xiang did not know how to answer.

“Old Mrs. Cen sat down and grabbed a handful of melon seeds. As she munched on them, she said, “She’s faking it?” ”

“”It... It’s not really faking it...”but it was no different from faking it. Having such a stepmother, Zhou Xiang was really helpless. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen spat out the melon seed shell, “Your stepmother is such a disgrace! “If I were her, I would just buy a bottle of pesticide and drink it to death. I don’t want to live in this world and annoy people! “Xiang Xiang, I don’t want to criticize you. If you had half the courage of burning mother, you wouldn’t have been bullied like that by Xie wanqiu all those years ago ”

“”And that Zheng Wanyin. I used to think that she was quite a good girl. She was quite good-looking and her voice was not bad. But after what she did today, her eating style was too ugly! “If I were Xie wanqiu, I would crawl into the ground on the spot! “But she’s not ashamed at all. Instead, she’s proud! “Xiangxiang, I’ll say it here today. I can’t have a heart-to-heart with that niece of yours! “I don’t know what kind of evil intentions people have in their hearts. You’re a heartless person. You’ve been schemed against by others, yet you’re still foolishly counting money for others!” ”

“Zhou Xiang nodded. She wanted to say a few words on behalf of Zheng Wanyin, but she swallowed the words that were about to come out of her mouth. ”

“As soon as she finished speaking, Old Mrs. Cen ate another melon seed. “Oh right, what’s that Xie Wanqiu up to now? Tell me and I’ll be happy.” ”

“Zhou Xiang felt that it was a little difficult to say it, but she had no choice but to say it, she simply said in a spurt of energy, “Isn’t she hospitalized? She thinks that this is all caused by searing. She wants searing to apologize to her. Otherwise, she’ll be staying in the hospital and won’t be able to get out!” ”

“”What? Who does she want to apologize to?”? “Old Madam Cen slammed the table and stood up. “I’ll go to her grandmother’s leg! “Go to the hospital immediately. I’ll pass a message to her. Tell her to stay in the hospital! “It’s best if she dies in the hospital! “If she comes out, she won’t Be Human!” ”
