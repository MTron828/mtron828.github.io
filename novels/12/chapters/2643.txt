Translator: 549690339

“Not only did Zhou Xiaowen earn 570,000 yuan a year, but the company’s benefits were also very good.”

“If not, the Zhou family would not have been able to afford a house.”

“Why did Li hang only earn 20,000 yuan after becoming a full-time employee? After all, Zhou Xiaowen had not even entered graduate school yet!”

“Li hang said, “I don’t have any work experience. It’s already very good that I can get a job worth 10,000 yuan right after graduating.””

“Zhou cuihua sighed. “That’s true. Hang Hang, don’t be anxious. You’re still your father’s only daughter. Even if your father is angry and ignores you now, when he gets old in the future, won’t all of his things be yours?””

Li Da Long was almost 50 years old. Could it be that he could still have a child with that second marriage woman?

“Moreover, Li Hang had always been the apple of Li Da Long’s eye. Back then, Li Hang had only said that he didn’t want a younger brother. Li Da Long didn’t have another child. Now that he was already so old, how could he have another child!”

It was absolutely possible!

“Zhou cui hua continued, “Your father has sold his house now. I’ve calculated that two houses should be sold for at least 40 to 50 million!””

“Speaking of this, Zhou Cui Hua was extremely regretful. She regretted that she did not have good eyesight at that time. She was guarding the 40 to 50 million property and did not know about it!”

“The word 40 to 50 million also made Li Hang feel uncomfortable for a moment. Immediately, her expression returned to normal.”

Zhou Cuihua was right. There was no overnight feud between father and daughter. She was Li Da Long’s only daughter. Li Da Long would forgive her one day.

“At that time, all the money would be hers.”

The difficulties were only temporary. She had to face the present difficulties bravely.

“”Mom, Can I rent a single room for You?”Li Hang continued.”

Zhou cuihua shook her head.

“Then where do you live?”Li Hang asked.

“Zhou cuihua said, “I’ll go look for your father.””

She had to find Li Dalong. She couldn’t let Li Dalong give all the money to that SL * t from his second marriage!

All the money was hers!

No one could snatch it away.

“Li hang said, “Do you know where he is?””

“Zhou cuihua said, “He should be in the south.””

“How do you know?”Li Hang asked in surprise.

“Zhou cuihua said, “I went to your uncle’s house today and accidentally heard it. Hang, don’t worry. I will definitely find them.”” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Li hang continued, “Why don’t we just forget about it?””

What was this called?

This was called playing hard to get.

Li Hang knew Zhou Cuihua too well.

“Zhou Cuihua liked to go against others the most. The more she objected, the more Zhou Cuihua had to do it.”

“Li hang observed Zhou Cuihua’s expression and said, “Mom, actually, it’s not easy for dad. He worked hard for so many years and finally went out to enjoy himself with Aunt Feng. You...””

“”I’m the one who should enjoy myself!”Zhou cuihua said excitedly, “I’ve been working hard for this family for decades! What’s that Shameless B * Tch? I’ve worked hard for this family for more than ten years, but she didn’t have to do anything and took advantage of me! Shameless! Really Shameless!””

“Zhou cuihua continued, “I must find them! I’m not having a good time, what right do they have to have a good time!””

“Li hang sighed, but his lowered eyes flashed with a bright light.”

The anger in Zhou Cuihua’s heart was indeed stirred up!

Very good.

“”Mom, have you really decided to go?”Li Hang continued to ask.”

“Of course!”Zhou cuihua nodded.

“Li hang sighed again and continued, “Alright then, I know you won’t listen to anything I say now. Rather than trying to persuade you, it’s better to support you.””

“Zhou cuihua said, “I’ll find them even if I have to search the ends of the Earth!””

“Why don’t I accompany you?”Li Hang suggested.

“”No need, no need. Just go to work properly,”Zhou Cuihua said. “I don’t know exactly where they are either.””

“”That’s fine too.”Li Hang took out what little money he had left. “Mom, I still have 5,000 yuan here. Take it and use it on the road.””

“Li hang came out of the lookout pavilion courtyard with a total of 15,000 yuan.”

“After taking out 5,000 yuan, he still had 10,000 yuan.”

“Zhou cuihua took the 5,000 yuan. “I still have 20,000 yuan with me. It’s a total of 25,000 yuan. I hope I can use this 25,000 yuan to find them.””

“Li hang continued, “I’ll start working tomorrow. If you don’t have enough money, just call me.””

“Zhou Cuihua was going to find Li Dalong after all. Of course, she would help him. After all, she was the one who benefited in the end.”

“Okay.”Zhou cuihua nodded.
