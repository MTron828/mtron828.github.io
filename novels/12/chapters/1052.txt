“After a few more punches, the bald man threw Zhao pingting away. ”

Bang!

Zhao Pingting was thrown to the ground and spat out another mouthful of blood.

“At this moment, Zhao Pingting could no longer feel any pain. She did not even have the strength to lift her fingers. ”

Zhao Pingting lay on the ground. Her skin turned cold and a pair of rough hands covered her.

Disgusting.

It was really too disgusting.

“Zhao Pingting’s eyes were filled with humiliation. She wanted to raise her knife and chop this perverted bald man to death, but she had no way of retaliating. She could only allow herself to be slaughtered. ”

“At this moment, the bald man suddenly stopped moving. “Bad Luck!” ”

Zhao pingting heaved a sigh of relief.

Thank you for your period!

Thank you for your period.

“The bald man wiped the blood off his hands and pulled Zhao Pingting by her hair, dragging her into the cage. ”

Kacha.

A lock was placed on the door of the cage.

Zhao Pingting lay limply in the cage and could only watch as the man assaulted another woman.

What made Zhao Pingting feel incredulous was that the woman who was dragged out by the man did not even resist.

What happened next was too bloody and violent. Zhao Pingting was so scared that she closed her eyes.

“Unfortunately, although her eyes were closed, her voice was still there. ”

It could not be forgotten.

...

On the other side.

Ye Zao sent an Lizi to the villa and drove home.

“After arriving at the Lin family’s house, Ye Zao sent a message to the three of them in a small group, [ I’m Home [ Dog Head -RSB- . ] ”

“An Lizi immediately replied, [ I’ve already eaten supper. [ photo jpg ]] ”

“Ye Zao looked at the picture of the crayfish that an Lizi sent him and suddenly had a huge appetite. He picked up his phone and ordered a takeaway as well. Then, he sent the screenshot of the order to the group. ”

“If it were any other time, Zhao Pingting would definitely reply immediately. After all, she was also a big foodie. ”

“But today, after ten minutes, there was still no news from Zhao Pingting. ”

Ye Zhuo frowned slightly and sent a message: [ Where’s Pingting? Why isn’t she talking? ]

“An Lizi replied: [ didn’t Pingting go to her childhood home? The two of them haven’t seen each other for a long time. They should be chatting, right? ] ”

Ye Zhuo opened Zhao Pingting’s chat box. [ hello? [ dog head ]

“Thinking that Zhao Pingting might be catching up with her, Ye Zao sent a message and went to code the school team’s aircraft carrier’s system. ”

The computer was full of professional code. It was like a mountain separating the two professions. Outsiders really could not understand it.

“Half an hour later, a servant knocked on the door. “Miss, your takeout has arrived.” ”

“Ye Zao walked over to open the door. “Thank you, Mrs Zhang.” ”

“It’s my pleasure.”

“Ye Zao ordered a spicy hot pot. As soon as he opened the bag, a spicy and fresh smell wafted towards him. Of course, he could not eat spicy hot pot without an ice-cold coke. Ye Zao went to the fridge to get another ice-cold coke before he started eating spicy hot pot. ”

“After eating a few mouthfuls of spicy hot pot, ye Zao picked up his phone, but there was still no reply from Zhao Pingting. ”

“As if something was wrong, ye Zhuo frowned slightly, put down his chopsticks, and sent a voice call to Zhao Pingting. ”

On the other side.

The sound of a voice call suddenly rang out in the quiet air.

“Zhao pingting, who was originally leaning against the Iron Cage in a daze, reacted in an instant. She looked at the only bright spot in Hei An. ”

It was her phone.

The voice call displayed ‘Great Burning’.

It was a voice call from ye Zao.

Perhaps ye Zao had already noticed that she was gone.

“Thinking of this, Zhao Pingting’s eyes were filled with hope. ”

“Finally, someone noticed that she was gone. ”

“Unfortunately, she was locked in the iron cage and could not get her phone. ”

“At this moment, the short-haired woman who had her head pressed against the wall by the pervert suddenly woke up. She wriggled her body and crawled towards the phone. ”

“As long as they could get the phone, they would be saved. ”

“After being locked in the basement for so long by the Bald Man, the short-haired woman wanted to go out even in her dreams. However, because her hands and feet were tied up by ropes, she was too slow. ”

The atmosphere in the basement became tense at this moment.

Zhao Pingting’s heart seemed to be pinched by someone. She did not even dare to breathe loudly.

Finally.

“The short-haired woman squirmed to the side of the phone. As her hands and feet were tied, she could only use her chin to swipe the phone. ”

“Seeing this, Zhao pingting heaved a sigh of relief. ”

Good!

Great!

She had finally reached the phone.

“As long as she could reach the phone, they would all be saved. ”

“Just as the short-haired woman used her chin to swipe the phone, her hair was suddenly grabbed by someone. ”

“In the cramped basement, there was only the echo of a voice call. ”T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m
