Translator: 549690339

“If Xu Yao marries he ziteng for the sake of marrying he ziteng, such a marriage would be meaningless and there would definitely be cracks in the future. ”

Moreover.

Xu Chaonan also did not think that his niece would be willing to give herself to he ziteng.

“Xu Yao had a business mind. As long as she was nurtured a little, she would definitely be able to become a famous female entrepreneur in the future. ”

Unfortunately.

The current Xu Yao was too impetuous.

She still needed to settle down.

Not Suitable?

What was Xu Chaonan saying?

She actually said that Xu Yao was not suitable for the he family.

Mother Xu snorted in her heart. She knew that Xu Chaonan did not have good intentions.

She was jealous of Xu Yao.

“It was fine if she could not get married, but she actually wanted to stop Xu Yao from getting married. ”

How could there be such an aunt in the world!

It was so disgusting!

“Although he had already scolded Xu Chaonan a hundred times in his heart, mother Xu did not show it on her face at all, she continued, “Chaonan, we are old, how can we keep up with the footsteps of the young people? As long as the two young people can look at each other, it will be fine.” ”

This sentence was saying that Xu Chaonan was being too nosy. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Xu Chaonan was not a fool, so he naturally understood the meaning behind this sentence, he continued, “Sister-in-law, Yaoyao is my niece. I hope that she can lead a good life and marry well more than anyone else. However, the He family is really not suitable for Yaoyao! Ask Yaoyao, does she really like he ziteng?” ”

Xu Yao had only taken a liking to the he family’s family background from the start.

Like?

How much could a liking be worth?

“In high school, Xu Yao had once rebelled and secretly returned to her hometown with the school Belle at that time. ”

The school bully was a poor student in the school.

“At that time, Xu Yao still couldn’t understand the meaning of poor students. ”

“Until, she went to the school bully’s hometown. ”

The toilet was open-air.

“In the summer, the family of four only had two rooms. ”

“The family had a dog, but only let the dog eat excrement. ”

“At that time, after seeing that scene, Xu Yao directly vomited. ”

It was very disgusting!

“From then on, Xu Yao understood one sentence. ”

A poor husband and wife were always sad.

How could a person who couldn’t feed the dog feed her enough feed her?

“If she really married the school bully, how would she live in the future? Continue to feed the dog excrement? ”

“Xu Yao looked at Xu Chaonan, then she said, “Auntie, I don’t think that liking can be a reason to marry a person! Life is based on basic necessities. If you can’t even guarantee these things, then what is liking?” ”

“Xu Chaonan was stunned, “But without a loving marriage, what’s the point of living a life where you hate each other? “If you want to have a better quality of life, you might as well become stronger. At the very least, you can control the finances and don’t have to look at others’faces.” ”

“Hearing this, Xu Yao also felt that it made sense. ”

“Compared to looking down on others, she naturally wanted to control the finances. ”

“The more Xu Chao Nan listened, the more she could not take it anymore. ”

“According to Xu Chao Nan’s thoughts, sooner or later, he would lead Xu Yao Astray! ”

“Xu Chao Nan’s mother smiled and said, “Chao Nan, you say that as if you have more experience.” ”

“Xu Chao Nan was a person who had never been married, so what right did he have to talk about this? ”

The smile on Xu Chaonan’s face froze for a moment.

Although she was still unmarried.

But she yearned for love more than anyone else.

Unfortunately.

The people she met were not good people.

That was why it had been delayed until now.

“After saying that, mother Xu continued, “Chaonan, you’re not young anymore. Your Brother has been worrying about you all day. Because of you, his hair has turned much whiter. I say, don’t be picky...” ”

“Xu Chaonan said, “Sister-in-law, tell my brother not to be anxious. This kind of thing can not be rushed. I’ll try to bring a boyfriend back next year.” ”

Bring a boyfriend back?

“Upon hearing this, mother Xu’s heart skipped a beat. ”

What was Xu Chaonan Thinking?

She already had a boyfriend?

“If Xu Chaonan were to get married, what would they do? ”

No.

No.

Xu Chaonan could not get married.

Xu Chaonan had to stay in the Xu family forever.

“Really?”Mother Xu turned the shock into a pleasant surprise.

Xu Chaonan nodded.

“Mother Xu continued, “So you have a target, Chaonan?” ”

“”Sort of,”said Xu Chaonan. ”

“Mother Xu frowned and said, “Where is the man from? There are so many bad people nowadays. Chaonan, don’t be deceived! Tell me about the man’s situation. I’ll get your brother to investigate.” ”

“”There’s no need.”Xu Chaonan looked at Xu Yao. “Yaoyao, think about your own matters. You’re an adult now. You know what to do and what not to do.” ”
