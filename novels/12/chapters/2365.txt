She had nothing to say to such unreasonable parents.

“Bai Jingshu looked at them and said, “Stop.” ”

It was time to clarify some things. Running away was not the way to solve the problem.

Lin Ze was stunned but did not say anything. He controlled the aircraft to stop.

“When they saw the aircraft stop, Bai Jiacheng and Zhou Ying were very excited. The reason the aircraft stopped meant that Bai Jingshu still had their parents in her eyes. If Bai Jingshu really did not want to acknowledge them, there was no need to stop. ”

“Jingshu!”

Bai Jiacheng and Zhou Ying immediately trotted over and stopped in front of the aircraft.

Lin Ze opened the cabin door and walked out with Bai Jingshu in his hand.

Bai Jingshu had transformed from a young girl into a young woman. The changes in her body were not small.

Zhou Ying was a little surprised. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Bai Jingshu continued, “Mr. and Mrs. Bai, ever since we signed the severance agreement that day, there has been no relationship between us. Why are you looking for me today?” ”

Mr. and Mrs. Bai?

“Upon hearing this, Zhou Ying’s eyes instantly turned red. “Jingshu, I’m your biological mother. I was pregnant with you for ten months and brought you up. If it weren’t for me, you wouldn’t be here. Is this how you’re treating me now?” ”

“Bai Jiacheng followed suit, “You were only this little when you were born. It was your mother who raised you one mouthful at a time. You can have nothing but a conscience! “Jingshu, what’s wrong with you now? “Why have you become so cold-blooded and heartless?” ”

“”Who is this cold-blooded and heartless person?”Lin Ze stood up and continued, “When you decided to starve Jingshu to death and create clones, didn’t you think of today?” ”

Elder Bai was the one who told Lin ze about the matter of clones.

“If he hadn’t heard it with his own ears, Lin Ze would never have believed that there were cruel parents like Bai Jiacheng and Zhou Ying in this world who could actually do this to their own daughter, they could even come up with such a cruel method like cloning! ”

“”Son-in-law, you’ve misunderstood! You’ve really misunderstood!”Bai jiasheng immediately explained, “Things are not what you saw at all! I can explain it to you! All parents in the world have the same heart. Jingshu is our daughter. The two of US love her too much, so how could we push her into the fire pit! “I don’t know where you heard these words, but I can promise you that your mother and I will never do anything to hurt Jingshu! “All of our intentions are for Jingshu’s Good!” ”

“At times like this, of course, they had to clean themselves up. ”

Lin Ze was their son-in-law. The most important thing for them now was to please Lin Ze and get him to acknowledge them.

“After that.., bai jiasheng continued, “Today is the day that Jingshu returns home. How about this, son-in-law, let’s take this opportunity to clear up this misunderstanding. I’ve already prepared tea at home and even prepared a room for you and Jingshu. You can just follow US home.” ”

“Lin Ze continued, “I know what’s going on. Mr. Bai, don’t spout nonsense here.” ”

Lin Ze was not a fool. He could be fooled by Bai Jiasheng’s words.

“Seeing Lin ze like this, Bai Jiasheng was a little nervous. ”

“Zhou Ying continued, “Jingshu, say something! “Even though mom and dad didn’t treat you very well when you were young, do we still hope for you to become a dragon or a Phoenix? “We also love our daughter dearly! “As the saying goes, all parents are alike. You’ve made so many mistakes since you were young, and mom and dad can forgive you. Now, Mom and dad only made a small mistake. Can’t you forgive Mom and Dad?” ”

“”If second sister hadn’t informed grandfather in time, Jingshu wouldn’t even be alive right now.”Lin Ze hit the nail on the head. ”

“The smile on Zhou Ying’s face froze on the corner of her mouth, and she looked a little embarrassed. ”

“Bai Jiacheng immediately said, “Son-in-law, didn’t I already say that it was all a misunderstanding? ! “Actually, we were just joking back then. I didn’t expect that this girl, Jingshu, would actually take it seriously! “Isn’t it normal to joke around when a family is together?” Bai Jiacheng looked at Bai Jingshu. “Jingshu, say something!” ”

“”Mr. Bai, what do you want me to say? is all this fake?”Bai Jingshu’s expression didn’t change at all, “It’s already happened. Stop lying to yourself! “I know very well why you’ve changed so much all of a sudden! “All you can see is that Lin Ze is different from before! “Don’t you feel that you’re being hypocritical?” ”

“At this point.., bai Jingshu continued, “Since you’ve all come here, I might as well make things clear today. From the moment we signed the severance agreement, we have nothing to do with each other anymore! “Please leave some face for each other!” ”

Neither Bai Jiacheng nor Zhou Ying expected Bai Jingshu to have such a reaction. It was unknown when Bai Jingshu had become like this.

“”Jingshu,”Zhou Ying immediately cried out, “Jingshu, you are your father’s eldest daughter and mine. Do you think we can not have you in our hearts? Father and mother were wrong just once. Can’t You Forgive Me?” ”
