“At this moment, professor Yue couldn’t believe his hearing. ”

It couldn’t be.

“Without his help, how could that A2 member who had never heard of crack the password! ”

She had personally set the password.

“Moreover, it was based on the Morse code. If she didn’t do anything, no one would be able to crack it. ”

“Professor Yue looked up at Tang Xue and said, “Are you sure that the A2 members have completed the order and delivered the goods in advance?” ”

“”Yes, I’m sure.”Tang Xue nodded. “I saw them hand over the goods with my own eyes.” ”

The last bit of color on professor Yue’s face disappeared without a trace.

Tang Xue was on the same side as her. She wouldn’t lie to her.

“”Professor Yue, what should we do now?”Tang Xue continued to ask. ”

What should we do?

How would she know what to do!

She had originally thought of using the Morse code to make CEN Shaoqing submit.

“But she didn’t expect that the A2 members had actually cracked the code, and now all the members of the Research Room had been replaced... ”

Professor Yue had never thought of this even in his dreams.

“Wan Sheng, who was standing at the side, shook his head helplessly when he saw professor Yue like this. “I’ve already said that master five is not someone who can be threatened just because he says so. What Happened Now? Do you regret it?” ”

“If professor Yue had listened to him earlier, such a thing would not have happened. ”

“Now, not only had she harmed herself, but she had also harmed the other members of the research room, causing them to lose their jobs. ”

“Since things had come to this point, one should know that Cen Shaoqing would no longer use the old staff of the original research lab. ”

“After all, no boss would like a traitor! ”

“Professor Yue raised his head and looked at Wan Sheng, his eyes full of anger. “Now that things have already happened, what do you want me to do? Why Don’t you kill me?” ”

“Wan Sheng Sighed. “What I mean is, if you had listened to me at that time, this matter could have been completely avoided.” ” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Tang Xue’s eyes were slightly red, “Uncle Wan, actually, Aunt Yue didn’t want it to be like this. Don’t talk about her. The most important thing now is how to salvage it. Aunt Yue has made so many contributions to the base. Master Five is too ruthless!” ”

“Professor Yue had been in the base for more than 20 years, but in the end, he still couldn’t compare to ye Zhuo’s position in Cen Shaoqing’s heart. ”

No wonder there was a saying in ancient times that a beautiful woman was a disaster.

Wasn’t someone like Ye Zhuo a disaster?

“For Ye Zhuo’s sake, Cen Shaoqing even chased out a technician like professor Yue. ”

“After hearing Tang Xue’s words, professor Yue also felt very wronged. ”

This was all Cen Shaoqing’s fault.

No.

It should be ye Zhuo’s fault.

“If it wasn’t for Ye Zhuo, she definitely wouldn’t have become like this. ”

“Wan Sheng turned to look at professor Yue and said, “Why don’t you go and apologize to master five?” ”

Apologize?

Professor Yue was stunned.

She wasn’t wrong in this matter. Why should she apologize?

“Whose side are you on? This matter isn’t my fault at all. You Want Me to apologize?”Professor Yue raised his head and looked at Wan Sheng.

Wan Sheng knew Professor Yue’s temper. He didn’t argue with her and didn’t say anything else. Whatever he said was wrong anyway.

...

On the other side.

Sun Yu was also the first to know that the A2 members had completed the order.

Her reaction was the same as professor Yue’s.

He couldn’t believe that someone could successfully replace them.

“Moreover, he had never heard of this group of people. ”

Who were these A2 members! ?

“Since they were so powerful, why hadn’t he heard of them before? ”

“At this moment, Sun Yu’s phone rang. ”

Sun Yu picked up the call.

It was a member from the research unit.

“Sun Yu said, “I’ll be down right away.” ”

Everyone was waiting downstairs for Sun Yu.

“When they saw Sun Yu, they immediately swarmed over. “Brother Sun, what do we do now?” ”

“Have you heard? The A2 member has completed the order and has already confirmed the delivery.”

No one in the entire research room had expected that there would be someone who could replace them in this world.

“After hearing the news, everyone was shocked. ”

“”I already know what happened.”Sun Yu stood up and raised her hands. “Everyone, quiet down and listen to me.” ”

“Hearing this, everyone immediately quieted down and looked up at Sun Yu. ”

“Sun Yu continued, “Everyone here is a core member of the CEN Group’s base. As long as we change our minds and return to work, the base will definitely accept us again!” ”

“Although the base already had some A2 members, could it be that those members did not have their own jobs? ”

The reason why master five was like this was to scare them so that they could quickly return to work.
