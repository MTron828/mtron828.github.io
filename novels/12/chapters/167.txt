Chapter 168: 087: tearing the mistress apart and getting a divorce! 4

After a long while, an Lizi’s emotions gradually calmed down. She sobbed, “Mom, Dad didn’t go to stock up at all.”

Xia Xiaoman was stunned. “Didn’t we want to talk about you? Why is your dad involved?”

An Lizi held Xia Xiaoman’s hand. “Mom, Listen to me.”

“Go ahead.”

An Lizi took a deep breath and tried to choose her words carefully. She thought that she would be able to tell Xia Xiaoman about this matter easily. However, when she really faced Xia Xiaoman, she realized.., how difficult it was to tell Xia Xiaoman the whole story.

“My dad, my dad... My Dad...”

Seeing her like this, Xia Xiaoman’s face turned pale. “What happened to your dad? Did something happen to him on the road? Lizi, don’t Scare Me!”

An Dongliang drove a large truck to get some goods.

Could it be that he had an accident?

At the thought of this, Xia Xiaoman’s eyes instantly turned red.

“It’s fine, Mom! He’s fine!”An Lizi cried. “Not only is he fine, there’s someone else out there!”

After saying these words in one breath, an Lizi felt that the huge rock in her heart had finally disappeared.

“What?”Xia Xiaoman could not digest the meaning of these words.

......

An lizi continued, “My Father Betrayed You! He has a mistress outside! Do you know how he spent his 30,000 yuan a month? He went to raise a mistress!”

Xia Xiaoman was stunned on the spot.

She did not have any expression on her face.

After a long while, she finally reacted, “Li-lizi, stop joking! Your father is not that kind of person!”

She was from the same village as an Dongliang.

The two of them grew up together. They were childhood sweethearts.

An Dongliang was an honest and honest person. How could he do something that would let her down?

Impossible!

It was impossible!

An lize knelt in front of Xia Xiaoman. “It’s true... It’s true...”

Xia Xiaoman turned her head. “No, it can’t be! Lize, you must have misunderstood your father!”

“I didn’t misunderstand him!”An Lizi took out a few photos from her bag, as well as a printed list at Ye Zao’s house. “Mom, this is the evidence! Moreover, he admitted it in front of me!”

Xia Xiaoman picked up the photos with trembling hands, and tears rolled down uncontrollably from her eyes.

How could this be?

Her husband, whom she had loved deeply for more than twenty years, actually betrayed her...

How could this be!

“Mom, get a divorce! You still have me in the future!”An Lizi continued, “You can’t give him a single cent of the family’s money! You worked hard to earn all these things, so you can’t let that mistress have it easy!”

Xia Xiaoman took out a tissue and quickly wiped the tears off her face, pretending that nothing had happened, and smiled at an Lizi, “Lizi, this is between US adults. You Don’t have to worry about it! Your task now is to study hard!”

“Mom?” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Xia Xiaoman patted an Lizi’s shoulder. “Don’t worry, Mom knows what to do. The college entrance exam is coming soon. At this time, don’t let your imagination run wild!”

It was she who had let the child down. She didn’t notice her husband’s abnormality earlier and let the child’s imagination run wild for so long.

This should not have been something that a child like an Lizi should have been worried about.

She should not have allowed the matters between adults to affect the child.

If this matter had any impact on an Lizi, she would regret it for the rest of her life.

Xia Xiaoman put away the receipt and the photos. “Mom is busy downstairs. Lizi, go back to your room and rest! At half past six, Mom will go upstairs to cook.”

Xia Xiaoman’s reaction was too calm, which made an lizi very uneasy. “Mom.”

“Lizi, I’m really fine.”

With that, Xia Xiaoman went downstairs.

She really acted as if nothing had happened and continued to chat and laugh with the employees.

An Lizi returned to the bedroom and lay on the bed. She had mixed feelings and felt very uncomfortable.

At 6:30, Xia Xiaoman came upstairs on time to cook dinner.

An dongliang came back as soon as the food was ready.

“It smells so good! Xiaoman, what shall we have for dinner tonight?”

Xia Xiaoman was walking out of the kitchen with the dishes in her hands. She looked at her husband in front of her. At that moment, she felt that this man was very unfamiliar to her.

“You’re back. Wash your hands first. I have something to tell you after washing your hands. We’ll eat after that.”

Although Xia Xiaoman’s tone was very calm, an Dongliang felt that there was something wrong with Xia Xiaoman today

However, when he looked at her again, Xia Xiaoman seemed to be no different from usual. She went to the bathroom to wash her hands and came out. She smiled and said, “What do you have to say before eating?”
