The third daughter and fourth daughter were given away.

“The youngest son was called Wang Baobao, who was one year younger than her. Just like his name suggested, Wang Baobao grew up in the palm of his hand, forming a stark contrast to the four sisters before him. ”

Zhao Pingting did not believe that there was anyone in this world who would throw away his own daughter.

“But now, she did. ”

“Mother Zhao continued, “Pingting, your uncle and aunt Wang had their own difficulties back then. Don’t worry, they will definitely come and visit you.” ”

“Zhao pingting said, “Mother, I don’t need them to visit me. I really don’t need them! “Don’t be too sad. I know my illness very well. If I really leave, don’t be sad either. Just treat it as if you have never raised a daughter like me.” ”

“Hearing this, mother Zhao’s heart ached. She said with a straight face, “You child, what nonsense are you talking about? ! You will recover! You will definitely recover! Listen to your mother, take your medicine and cooperate with the treatment!” ”

Zhao Pingting smiled and nodded. “Yes! I will be obedient.”

The family sent Zhao Pingting back to the ward.

Although Zhao Pingting had clearly stated that she did not want to see her biological parents.

“However, the Zhao parents did not give up on the idea of inviting Wang Dancai and Lan Yueyin to the hospital. ”

Zhao Pingting’s life was likely to end in three months.

“As parents, they had to think of a way to open the knot in the child’s heart. They could not let the child leave with regrets ”

On the other side.

The Wang family.

Wang Dancai and Lan Yueyin were sitting in the living room eating.

“Suddenly, Lan Yueyin said, “Dancai, the results of the college entrance examination are out. I heard that our four girls scored over 580 points!” ”

“Really?”Wang da Cai asked.

Lan Yueyin nodded. “How can it be fake? I heard sister Li say it with my own ears! Isn’t sister Li in the same unit as Old Zhao’s wife?”

“Wang da Cai put down his chopsticks. “Then our four girls are really not simple! With 580 points, we can even get one book, right?” ”

“That’s right. I heard that they filled in the capital Normal University!”

“”Go to the capital to study?”Wang da Cai’s eyes lit up. “The capital is the capital! If our four girls were to date someone in the capital in school, wouldn’t she be rich!” ”

Everyone in the capital was rich.

“As the saying goes, one person attained enlightenment and the whole family ascended to immortality. ”

“Hearing this, Lan Yue Yin’s eyes lit up as well. ”

“”No! This kind of good thing can’t be given to the old Zhao family! We are the biological parents of the fourth girl! We have to go and recognize the fourth girl! When the time comes, let her introduce a daughter-in-law from the capital to Little Treasure. Then, wouldn’t our little treasure be a citizen of the capital?” ”

“Wang Dazai nodded. “You’re absolutely right! Our little treasure is so good-looking and good at studying. He will definitely be able to find a daughter from the capital!”In fact.., wang Baobao had already been spoiled beyond recognition by them. It was just that they had yet to realize the seriousness of the problem. ”

“Lan yueyin frowned and continued, “What if the fourth girl doesn’t acknowledge us?” ”

The fourth girl had been carried away at birth and had no emotional foundation with them. Lan Yueyin was a little worried.

“Wang Dazai said, “That won’t happen! “No matter what, the fourth girl is our biological child. Children are soft-hearted and easy to deceive. When the time comes, we will complain in front of her. If it really doesn’t work out, we will kneel down and admit our mistakes. She will definitely forgive us!” ”

“Lan Yueyin nodded and said with a smile, “You’re right. Then this matter is settled! Tell me, why is our child so promising! Little Treasure scored 410 points, and the fourth girl also scored more than 500 points!” ”

“”How can I, Wang Dacai, not be promising?” ”

The two of them were discussing this matter.

“Suddenly, there was a knock on the door. ”

“Who is it?”

Lan Yueyin walked over to open the door.

“The moment the door opened, she saw the Zhao couple. ”

“Lan Yueyin immediately smiled. “Aren’t they his uncle and aunt? Rare guests! Come in and have a seat! Come in and have a seat! His uncle and aunt, have you eaten? If you haven’t eaten, come eat with us. Our family just started eating.” ” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Mother Zhao said, “You’re too polite. We’ve already eaten.” ”

“Then come in and have a seat.”

“Because she had the heart to recognize Zhao Pingting, Lan Yueyin was especially enthusiastic. She was very calm and made tea. ”

“Mother Zhao took the tea from Lan Yueyin and said, “Big Sister Lan, you don’t have to be so polite. Actually, I came here today to talk to you about Pingting.” ”

“Lan yueyin smiled and said, “I heard that our four girls scored more than 580 points in the college entrance examination. Is this true?” ”
