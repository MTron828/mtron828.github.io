The lawyer knew about Zhao Zhendong’s hidden illness. Zhao Zhendong would never have a child of his own in this lifetime. Zhao Xueyin was his only child. They should have kept each other warm in the past. There should not be any estrangement between them.

“Zhao Xueyin looked out of the window. There was no expression in her eyes. Her tone was somewhat sorrowful. “Big Brother Si, why do you think I’m not a boy?”She was deeply influenced by Father Zhao, this was not the first time Zhao Xueyin hated her own background. ”

“The lawyer knew Zhao Xueyin’s heart knot. He patted her shoulder. “Xueyin, don’t think like that, and don’t underestimate yourself! In My Eyes, you’re a very outstanding girl. You Don’t lose to any man.” ”

“Zhao Xueyin smiled and turned to look at the lawyer. She regained her shrewd and capable look. “Alright, let’s not talk about this anymore! How’s The Consortium? Did Anything Happen?”Zhao Xueyin trusted the lawyer very much, after leaving the consortium, other than the necessary video conference, she left everything else to Si Lu. ”

“Everything is fine with the consortium. You Don’t have to worry.”Si Lu said.

“”That’s good.”Zhao xueyin nodded and continued, “By the way, Big Brother Si, I’ve already met ye Zao.” ”

“How is it?”Si Lu asked.

Si Lu had only sent people to investigate ye Zao’s information. He had never really interacted with ye Zao.

“Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes. “Ye Zhuo isn’t as smart as I thought. Perhaps... you’re right, I overestimated her.” ”

“Si lui smiled. “I’ve already said it. You Don’t have to take her to heart. If she’s intelligent, she’ll definitely be hurt. Her fate will only be worse than ye Langhua’s!” Ye Zhuo, this granddaughter of his, would definitely surpass her! ”

This was also the reason why si lui had never taken ye Zhuo seriously.

“Zhao Xueyin nodded. “Brother Si, you’re right.” ”

“”Now that we’ve met her, when do you plan to go back?”Si lui continued to ask. ”

“”Let’s Wait a little longer.”Zhao Xueyin thought for a while, “I still want to know more about ye Zao. No matter what happens to ye Zao, she’s still ye Langhua’s granddaughter. Also, I’m a little worried that ye Langhua will suddenly change her mind and let Lin Ze take over the consortium.” ”

“Zhao Zhendong had a very serious preference for sons over daughters. If ye Langhua really let Lin Ze take over the Shunxi Consortium, Zhao Zhendong would lose a lot of momentum. ”

“Thinking of this, Zhao Xueyin was regretting why she wasn’t a man! ”

“If she was a man, she wouldn’t have to care about these problems, and she wouldn’t have to worry about who she would lose to! ”

Why?

Why was this so?

“Every time she thought of this question, Zhao Xueyin felt so uncomfortable that she couldn’t breathe. ”

Zhao Xueyin tried her best to calm herself down.

“Seeing Zhao Xueyin like this, the lawyer poured Zhao Xueyin a glass of water, he comforted her gently, “Xueyin, don’t put too much pressure on yourself!”! Putting aside whether ye Langhua would let Lin Ze take over the position of grandfather Ye, even if Lin Ze did take over the position of grandfather Ye, what could he do? Everyone was aware of your talent. Moreover, you grew up under the watchful eyes of the partners. would everyone support a young boy who didn’t know anything? “Lin Ze is only 20 years old. Other than ye Zao’s small achievements in the technology industry, Lin Ze isn’t even worth mentioning! “He’s not even a hair in front of you!” ” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“At this point, Si lui paused and continued, “If ye Langhua really lets Lin ze take over the position of Old Master Ye, it might be a good thing for you.” ”

“What do you mean?”Zhao Xueyin raised her head to look at Si lui.

“Si lui continued, “Didn’t uncle always think that you’re not as good as boys? Then you can prove to uncle that you’re better than Lin Ze! Even if there were ten Lin Ze, they wouldn’t be as good as you! Even if ye Langhua has a pair of granddaughters, they wouldn’t be as good as you alone!” ”

Si Lui and Zhao Xueyin had known each other for many years.

“In his eyes, Zhao Xueyin was a very outstanding person. ”

“However, Zhao Xueyin often felt inferior and suspicious because of her gender. ”

Si lui really felt sorry for her.

“Hearing this, Zhao Xueyin seemed to find some comfort. She looked up at si lui and said, “Brother Si, thank you for comforting me.” ”

“”I’m not comforting you. I’m telling the truth,”Si lui continued, “The times have changed long ago. Men and women have long been equal. Xueyin, I hope you can face yourself and see your own strengths.” ”
