“A sudden brake. Due to inertia, all the people in the car leaned forward. ”

“Feng Xianxian immediately thought of Old Lady Lin’s concern and asked, “Grandma, How Are You?” ”

Old Lady Lin smiled and shook her head. “I’m fine.”

“After saying that, Old Lady Lin looked up at the driver in the front seat. ”

“”Little Zhao, how Do You Drive?” ”

“The driver, Little Zhao, looked back with some difficulty. “Old Mrs. Lin, they said they want to check the car.” ”

“”Check the car?”Old Mrs. Lin frowned and said, “Are they blind?”How dare they check her car? They didn’t know that she was an old lady of the Lin family. ” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“The driver continued, “If they don’t let them check, they won’t let them in.” ”

“Check! Let them check!”Old Lady Lin’s expression didn’t look too good. She was already thinking that she would have to fire these people when she returned!

She didn’t even have the ability to see!

The driver nodded and got out of the car to open the door.

Four security personnel came over to check the car.

“The head of security at the front looked at Feng Xianxian and said, “Old Lady Lin, I’m sorry. This young lady can not enter.” ”

“Old Lady Lin frowned and said, “Xianxian is my guest! What right do you have to not let her in?” ”

“The head of security continued, “I’m sorry, this is Mr. Lin’s idea. We are only following the rules.” ”

Jinxiu manor was a private manor and the security work was done very well.

“As long as the owner of the manor did not agree, outsiders were not allowed to enter the manor without permission. ”

Mr. Lin?

It was obvious that this person was Lin Jincheng.

“Old Mrs. Lin was furious, “Who does Lin Jincheng think he is! I am his mother! I am the old lady of the Lin Family! Xianxian is my guest! Get Out of my way! I want to see who dares to stop me!” ”

“”I’m sorry, we are also following Mr. Lin’s instructions.”The security supervisor’s attitude was very firm, “You are the old lady of the Lin family, of course you can go in, but not this Miss Feng!” ”

“Old Lady Lin was so angry that her face turned white, “The person in charge of the Lin family is me! Who Does Lin Jincheng think he is! He said that whoever isn’t allowed to go in can’t go in? I’m telling you! Quickly get out of my way! Otherwise, I’ll make you suffer!” ”

Unfilial son.

Lin Jincheng was simply an unfilial son.

How could she give birth to such an unfilial son!

“The security supervisor continued, “I’m sorry, Old Lady Lin. The head of the Lin Family Manor is Mr. Lin, so we have to listen to Mr. Lin. He said that whoever is not allowed to enter can not enter.” ”

“If the security personnel did not let them in, the car would not be able to enter. ”

Feng Xianxian frowned.

She was the same as Old Lady Lin. She did not expect Lin Jincheng to be so ruthless!

“Feng Xianxian narrowed her eyes and walked in front of Old Lady Lin, she said pitifully, “Grandma, since Uncle Lin won’t let me in, then forget it! It’s pretty good that I’m staying in that apartment now. You Don’t have to compromise with this kind of person for my sake.” ”

“These words seemed to be persuading Old Lady Lin, but they were actually adding fuel to the fire, igniting the anger in Old Lady Lin’s heart. ”

Hearing this.

A few security personnel frowned slightly.

This kind of person?

What did Feng Xianxian mean by this kind of person?

It was obvious that she was looking down on people.

“Ye Zhuo was so outstanding, but she was not as arrogant as Feng Xianxian. ”

“A pot of water does not make a sound, but half a pot of water makes a clanking sound. ”

“Old Lady Lin got out of the car and pointed at the security supervisor. “Go in and tell Lin Jincheng that if he doesn’t let Xianxian in, then I won’t go in either! Go and ask him if he doesn’t want to acknowledge me as his mother anymore!” ”

“Under the current circumstances, Old Lady Lin could only use her trump card! ”

She didn’t believe that Lin Jincheng wouldn’t acknowledge her as his mother anymore!

“No matter what, she would let Feng Xianxian live in the Lin family openly today. ”

No one could stop her!

“Hearing this, the head of security and the other three security guards looked at each other and then said to the other security guard, “Xiao Dai, go in and inform Mr. Lin.” ”

They had almost broken off their relationship.

This was not a small matter.

“Okay.”Xiao Dai nodded and stood on the balance car at the side. He controlled the balance car to drive in the direction of the Lin family.

“Soon, they arrived at the Lin family home. ”

Xiao Dai walked over and rang the doorbell.

The person who opened the door was the butler.

“”Butler Wu, is Mr. Lin Home?” ”

Butler Wu nodded. “Please follow me in.”

The Butler led Xiao Dai inside.

“Just then, a light voice appeared in the air. “Grandpa Butler.” ”

“Miss.”The Butler turned around.
