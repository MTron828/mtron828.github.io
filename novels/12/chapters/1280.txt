“Soon, a few men in uniform walked up. “Miss Ye.” ”

“”Get her out of here,”ye Zao said softly. ”

“Yes!”

Zhao Xueyin kept retreating. “Brother! Brother! I’m your sister. You Can’t treat me like this! Brother!”

Ye Sen acted as if he didn’t hear Zhao Xueyin’s voice.

Zhao Xueyin was in despair. She felt extremely uncomfortable.

Why?

Why did God treat her like this?

At the police station.

In the interrogation room.

“No matter what the police asked, Father Zhao kept his mouth shut. ”

“As long as he didn’t speak, the police wouldn’t be able to convict him. ”

Moreover.

He had observed that the police had yet to capture Mike.

“If Mike wasn’t captured, what was the use of detaining him? ”

“”Officer comrade,”father Zhao said very excitedly, “I am really wronged. Yesen is my biological son. As a father, how could I harm my own son? If it were you, would you hire a murderer to harm your own son? Haven’t you heard the saying, “A vicious tiger will not eat its own son!” ”

Captain Li took a photo of the evidence in front of Father Zhao. “You said that you did not harm your son. Then what are these?”

The police didn’t care about human kindness. They cared about evidence.

This was a photo of Father Zhao and Mike Meeting.

There was also a screenshot of his conversation with Mike.

“Captain Li continued, “We’ve checked. Before you hired a murderer, you didn’t know that Yesen was your son. This person’s name is Mike. He’s an international assassin! If you’re not a suspect, why did you meet with Mike?” ”

Father Zhao was a little flustered.

But he was still calm on the surface.

“If he had known this would happen, he definitely wouldn’t have let Mike do anything to hurt Yesen. ”

Father Zhao was very regretful now.

“”What Mike? I don’t even know Mike!”Father Zhao continued, “Officer, I’m really a good citizen. Besides, aren’t assassins only found in TV dramas? “There are no assassins in real life, officer, stop joking!” ”

“Captain Li knocked on the table. “If you don’t know Mike, why are you sitting with him?” ”

“”Officer, can’t you see that the tables nearby are full? I’m just sharing a table with him!”Father Zhao looked like he was wronged, “Don’t tell me that before I share a table, I have to investigate the other party’s ancestors?” ”

“To be on the safe side, Father Zhao and Mike would always choose a teahouse restaurant that was full of people to meet. ”

This would create the illusion of sharing a table.

“Captain Li continued, “But according to the owner of the restaurant, your relationship with Mike is not as simple as sharing a table! It’s 30 minutes of eating, and 20 minutes of chatting.” ”

“Father Zhao said, “I said that I’m sharing a table with him. Isn’t it normal for us to chat before sharing a table? At the very least, we have to express our gratitude to him! “Before sharing a table, I didn’t know what kind of killer he was! “If I knew, I definitely wouldn’t choose to share a table with someone like him!” ”

Captain Li narrowed his eyes. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Zhao Zhenfei was more difficult to deal with than he had imagined.

“A normal person would probably be defeated in front of so much solid evidence, but Zhao Zhenfei was still as calm as ever. ”

“If not for his many years of experience in handling cases, even captain Li might have been deceived by Father Zhao! ”

“”I’m really innocent!”Father Zhao continued, “You said that I hired a murderer, but why would I do that? What’s My Motive? Am I too full of myself to hurt my own son?” ”

“To take revenge on Ye Zao.”Captain Li exposed father Zhao’s thoughts.

“”Officer comrade, I’ll say it again. I’m really innocent! I didn’t do anything! If you have the time, you should investigate the real murderer and not waste your time on me!” ”

“Captain Li looked into Father Zhao’s eyes. “Be lenient if you confess, but be strict if you resist! Admit that we’ll be lenient with you. If you continue like this, it won’t be good for you!” ”

Captain Zhao subconsciously avoided captain Li’s eyes. “I didn’t do anything. What do you want me to admit? What era is it now? Don’t tell me you want to beat me into a confession?”

“Zhao Zhenfei!”Captain Li raised his voice.

“”Sir, I’m really innocent!” ”

“Officer Yin walked over from the side. “Zhao zhenfei, now that the evidence is in front of you, how long do you want to be stubborn?” ”

Father Zhao simply did not speak.

“Zhao Zhenfei!”Officer Yin slammed the table.

“Father Zhao looked at officer Yin. “Officer, I’m timid and can not withstand a scare!” ”
