“Ye Zao said unhurriedly, “It’s alright... He’s just an old antique.” ”

Old Antique?

How Old was he?

“He was probably old enough to be ye Zao’s father, right? ”

Feng Xianxian and Bai Xiaoman looked at each other and saw the mockery in each other’s eyes.

“Li Yueyue was too curious about what ye Zao’s boyfriend looked like, so she asked, “Is your boyfriend coming to pick you up later?” ”

“Ye Zao said, “We have an appointment at two in the afternoon.” ” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“”Two o’clock?”Li Yueyue said with a regretful look, “I’m taking the bullet train at 1:30! If I had known earlier, I would have snatched the ticket at 2:30!” ”

It was hard to get a ticket during the eleventh Golden Week. It was almost impossible to change the ticket.

“Ye Zao said, “How long will it take you to take the Bullet Train Home?” ”

“Li Yueyue thought for a moment. “The bullet train will take 18 hours. Then, adding on the transfer, it will take about 21 hours to get home.” ”

21 hours?

“Hearing this answer, Ye Zhuo felt his scalp go numb. ”

It was too difficult for her to travel for 21 hours!

“Li Yueyue continued, “Actually, it’s faster to travel by plane, but I’m airsick, so I can’t fly.” ”

Can’t Fly?

“Hearing this, Bai Xiaoman almost laughed out loud. ”

Li Yueyue was a poor wretch. Could she take a plane?

She couldn’t even take a plane.

She overestimated herself!

She didn’t even write a draft when she was bragging.

“Hearing this, Ye Zao got up from the hammock and rummaged through her bag. In a moment, she flipped to a bottle of transparent spray, “Yueyue, this is a spray that specializes in airsickness. You can try it when you come to school. The effect is pretty good.” ”

Bai Xiaoman looked at Ye Zao.

She had only heard of airsickness spray.

“The inventor was Miracle Doctor Ye, who cured cancer. What the hell was airsickness spray? ”

It was a very small bottle with no label on it.

One look and it was obvious that it was a three-product.

“Seeing this, Bai Xiaoman looked disdainful, her eyes full of ridicule. ”

Li Yueyue was a braggart.

Ye Zao was also a braggart.

No wonder people said that birds of a feather flock together!

“Li Yueyue reached out and took the bottle from ye Zhuo. There was no doubt in her eyes, “Thank you, burning. Then I’ll try it when I come back. Where did you buy this spray? If the effect is good, I’ll have to Buy More for preparation! My mom and my grandma are both a Little Airsick!” ”

“Ye Zha peeled a milk candy. “I made this up by myself. If it’s useful, you can just tell me when the time comes. I still have a lot of it here.” ”

“Hearing this, Bai Xiaoman was speechless. ”

Did Ye Zha think she was Godly Doctor Ye? She could invent a godly device that could cure motion sickness just by messing around?

She was imitating him!

He actually took advantage of godly doctor ye’s popularity. He was really shameless.

“Li Yueyue hugged ye Zao excitedly. “Zao Zao, thank you.” ”

“You’re welcome.”

“Li Yueyue continued, “When I come, I’ll bring you beef jerky, milk skin, and cheese that can only be bought from our place!” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Then you mustn’t forget. I’ve already written it down in a small notebook.” ”

“”Don’t worry, I definitely won’t forget.”Li Yueyue patted her chest and said. ”

“At 12 o’clock, Li Yueyue set off for the train station. ”

Ye Zhuo sent her to the bus stop.

“After returning to the dormitory, Ye Zhuo did not stay idle. He turned on his computer and communicated with Li Shang. ”

The situation at the management company had already stabilized.

“Li Shang had signed a total of more than 200 streamers. Among them, 50 were currently popular streamers, 100 were not popular, and the remaining 50 were newbies who had just entered the circle. ”

Li Shang: [ there are a few things that need to be discussed in person. When are you free? ]

Bei Feng: [ I might not have the time recently. Let’s Wait a little longer. ]

“Li Shang: [ alright, I’ll wait for your reply then. Oh right, I’ve sent you a document. Please take a look. If there are no problems, I’ll sign it. ] ”

Ye Zhuo clicked accept.

“The speed at which she read the document was very fast. Her eyes were like a scanner, scanning through everything with a single glance. ”

“About five minutes later, Li Shang received a reply from the other party. [ I have marked all the problematic areas for you. After you have corrected them, send them to me again. ] ”

Li Shang was stunned.

The document was a total of sixteen pages.

He had finished reading it so quickly?

“Li Shang quickly clicked to accept it. When he saw it, he was immediately stunned. ”

“Because the other party not only read all of it, but also commented on every page. ”

Li Shang was shocked.

It was hard to imagine what kind of person was sitting across from him!

Ye Zhuo had just finished processing the documents sent by Li Shang when he received a new message.
