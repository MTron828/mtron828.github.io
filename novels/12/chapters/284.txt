“Sure.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“”Miss Ye, Please.”Dean Zhou made a ‘please’gesture. ”

Ye Zhuo followed Dean Zhou’s footsteps.

He watched the two of them leave.

“Mother Zhao looked at Zhao Pingting. “Pingting, does this mean that your classmate really has a way to cure cancer?” ”

Even the Dean had come to see ye Zao in person.

This meant that ye Zao was really capable.

How could a normal person be valued so highly by the dean?

“Zhao Pingting nodded. “Mom, I believe in Zao Zao!” ”

“An Lizi said, “Auntie, don’t worry! Zao Zao never does anything that she’s not confident about.” ”

Zhao Yingjun felt uncertain.

“Firstly, it was because ye Zao was too young. ”

“Secondly, it was because ye Zao and Zhao Pingting were classmates. ”

She was still a third-year high school student.

Was It really okay?

“On the way home, he told Tang Jia about his worries. ”

“Tang Jia said, “Yingjun, I know you’re worried about Pingting, but Pingting has already contracted this illness. Although we all insist on treating Pingting’s illness, in fact, we all know in our hearts that this illness is very difficult to cure! “Now that someone has said that it can be cured, let’s Believe in her for once! “What if Pingting really recovers? “If we believe in her once, at least we can see some hope. If we don’t believe in her, then we won’t be able to see any hope at all. “Moreover, I believe that no one would joke about this kind of matter. If Pingting’s classmate really doesn’t have any confidence at all, then she wouldn’t say such big words! “Because to her, it’s meaningless!” ”

The premise of lying was to gain benefits. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“But to Ye Zhuo, it couldn’t bring any benefits. ”

“Since it was a matter with no benefits, why would she lie? ”

That was why Tang Jia trusted ye Zhuo very much.

“At this moment, Tang Jia seemed to have suddenly thought of something and continued, “Oh right, that classmate Pingting, she’s also this year’s top scorer in the science college entrance examination! I heard that she scored a high score of 749 points!” ”

“You said that Ye Zhuo is the top scorer in the College Entrance Examination?”Zhao Yingjun asked in disbelief.

“Tang Jia nodded and took out her phone, “A few days ago, a reporter interviewed her. I can still find it on my phone now! “Oh right, this ye family’s private dish was opened by ye Zhuo’s mother. Look, now everyone says that this is the top scorer’s restaurant. Ever since ye Zhuo got the top scorer, their family’s business has been booming!” ”

He saw the news on his phone.

Zhao Yingjun was stunned!

The college entrance exam savant!

This was the college entrance exam’s adverbial phrase!

She was a savant. She wouldn’t have nothing better to do and joke about her future.

Zhao Yingjun was completely convinced of this.

In the Dean’s office.

He chatted with ye Zao for a long time.

“From the beginning, Dean Zhou was in disbelief. Now, he firmly believed in ye Zao. It took less than 30 minutes. ”

This was because ye Zao’s understanding of viruses and cancer cells had far surpassed that of ordinary people! Even professional oncologists had to lower their heads in front of her!

This was a kind of understanding that looked at the essence through the phenomenon!

Director Zhou had never known that there was someone who could analyze cancer cells so thoroughly.

“”Listening to your words is really better than studying for ten years!”Director Zhou stood up and said, “Miss Ye, whatever you need from now on, our institute will do our best to cooperate with you!” ”

“Thank you.”

“”Miss Ye, we should be the ones thanking you.”Director Zhou was very excited. ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Director Zhou, it’s still a little too early to say thank you. After I’ve successfully developed the medicine and finished the surgery, it’s not too late for you to say thank you.” ”

“Okay.”Director Zhou nodded.

“After ye Zhuo left, director Zhou immediately called for an emergency meeting of all the doctors in the hospital. ”

He also set up a plan a team to fully cooperate with Ye Zhuo’s work.

“”Doctor Su, you will be the team leader of Group A. in a while, you will go to Ward C102 to look for Miss Ye. For the rest of the time, you just have to listen to her arrangements.” ”

This doctor su was called Su Zishan.

She was a first-class expert in the oncology department and had returned from studying abroad.

Her grades were very excellent.

“Of course, she wasn’t willing to let Su Zishan listen to a little girl and be her assistant, “Director Zhou, I still have a few patients with me. I might not be able to deal with them during this period of time. You should find someone else!” ”

She saw that director Zhou had become muddle-headed due to old age.

He actually believed that there was someone in this world who could cure cancer.

“She was a top student who came back from studying abroad. She won all kinds of awards, but she couldn’t figure out the cancer cells. ”

What awards did that little girl win?
