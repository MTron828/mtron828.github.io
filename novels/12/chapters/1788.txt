“At the end of her sentence, Li Yueyue was speechless. This was the first time she had met a straight man who only existed in the online world. ”

“Hearing this, Ye Zao chuckled. She really didn’t expect that Lin Weiwei, who usually didn’t talk much, was actually a straight man. ”

“Li Yueyue continued, “I chatted with him for a week and didn’t continue chatting! Then, there’s someone chasing me now, and I’m still hesitating whether to accept him.” ”

“Who is it?”Ye Zhuo was a little curious.

“Li Yueyue said, “A senior in the fourth year. To be honest, he’s really not bad looking. He’s just a little worse than Lin Weiwei, but his character is quite good.” ”

“Ye Zhuo said, “You can test the other party’s character first. If you think it’s good, you can try dating him. But you have to know your limits.” ”

“No matter what, girls had to learn how to protect themselves and love themselves. ”

“Although men and women were said to be equal, they were also not equal. ”

“After a man had sex with a woman, he could just pull up his pants and leave. However, if the woman got pregnant accidentally, it would be terrible. At that time, the injured one would still be a girl. ”

“”Okay.”Li Yueyue nodded. “Don’t worry, I know.” ”

“At this moment, there was a knock on the door. ”

“”Zha Zha, I’ll go open the door first. You Go to the bathroom and change your clothes. We’ll go out for dinner later.” ”

Ye Zha nodded slightly. “Okay.”

Li Yueyue ran over to open the door.

“As soon as she opened the door, she saw a girl holding a bouquet of roses standing at the door. “May I know if Li Yueyue is in this dormitory?” ”

“I’m Li Yueyue.”

“”Hello.”The girl smiled and said, “This is the flower that senior brother Ouyang asked me to give you.” ”

This was the first time that Li Yueyue had received a flower from the opposite sex in her entire life. She felt extremely surprised and took the flower with both hands. “Thank you.”

“You’re welcome.”

Li Yueyue carried the flower back to her room with an unconcealable smile on her face. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Ye Zao changed his clothes and walked out of the bathroom. When he saw Li Yueyue holding a bouquet of flowers, he raised his eyebrows slightly and asked, “The person who is chasing you sent this?” ”

“”Yes.”Li Yueyue nodded. “Zao Zao, what if I’m a little tempted?” ”

“How could a young girl in her early twenties, when she was officially yearning for a beautiful love, withstand such an attack. ”

“Ye Zao smiled slightly. “Keep calm and test your character. If you really think it’s not bad, you can try dating.” ”

“Li Yueyue sniffed the roses and continued, “Zao Zao. Will your boyfriend Give You Flowers?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zhonghua nodded slightly.

“Although the flowers did not have any practical use, CEN Shaoqing had never lacked the sense of ritual. ”

Downstairs.

Ouyang Nai stood under the Camphor Tree and waited for the girl to send flowers.

“Seeing the girl come down, she immediately jogged over. “How was it? How did Li Yueyue React?” ”

“The girl said, “I was a little happy and a little surprised. If you work harder, there shouldn’t be any problems.” ”

Ouyang Nai nodded. “Thank you.”

“You’re welcome.”

Ouyang Nai raised her head and looked in the direction of the dormitory building. Her eyes were full of determination.

He must catch up to Li Yueyue!

“After chatting with Li Yueyue, Ye Zhuo briefly explained the situation to Zhou Yuelian on wechat. ”

Zhou Yuelian was so angry that she immediately called Lin Weiwei and scolded him.

“Lin Weiwei was so unromantic, it would be strange if he could find a girlfriend in the future. ”

What kind of girl would find such a straight man? !

Lin Weiwei was scolded so badly that he didn’t know what he did wrong!

Could it be that he was wrong to make Li Yueyue not indulge in online games?

“According to research, children of parents who indulged in online games had an IQ 5% higher than that of normal parents! ”

It was good to stay up late at night. They would go bald and also affect their health.

As for the stomach pain and drinking hot water.

“If the stomach pain didn’t drink hot water, should they drink ice water? ”

Wouldn’t drinking ice water aggravate the illness?

Women were really too strange!

Lin Weiwei scratched his hair.

No wonder Li Yueyue suddenly didn’t reply to his wechat. So it was because of this.

...

“Xu Xiao would go to the rice noodle shop to open it every day, hoping to bump into Lin Ze. ”

“But strangely, Lin Ze suddenly stopped coming to eat during this period of time. ”

Xu Xiao was a little discouraged.

“”Excuse me, can I Sit Here?”At this moment, a pleasant male voice appeared in the air. ”

“Xu Xiao looked up and saw that the person was wearing a tailored suit. He was handsome, and Xu Xiao’s gaze shifted to his wrist. ”

MK’s latest watch.

It was sold on the official website for eight figures and was a limited edition.

“At this moment, three words appeared in Xu Xiao’s mind. ”

He ziteng.

“Yes, it was he ziteng. ”

“Xu Xiao was more familiar with the wealthy families in the capital, and he ziteng had also understood them. ”

The future successor of the He group was a good friend of CEN fifth master.

She did not expect that he ziteng would come to such a place to eat.

This was really an unexpected gain!

“Xu Xiao smiled and said, “There’s no one here. You can take a seat.” ”

“Thank you.”He ziteng leaned over and sat opposite Xu Xiao.

“He had also graduated from C University. When he was a student, he often came to this restaurant to eat. Therefore, whenever he reminisced about his university life, he would come to this restaurant to sit. ”

“However, there were too many people in this restaurant. He did not want to wait any longer, so he could only share a table with others. ”

“You’re welcome.”

“After recognizing that this person was he ziteng, Xu Xiao paid special attention to him. When the rice noodles were served, she wasn’t taking pictures, but rather, she endured the nausea in her body and ate the rice noodles. ”

“During this process, she even added he ziteng on wechat. ”

He ziteng was much easier to flirt with than Lin Ze.

“Most importantly, he ziteng’s family background wasn’t much worse than the Lin family’s. Moreover, he ziteng and Cen Wu Ye were good friends. ”

Xu Xiao looked at he ziteng’s back and narrowed her eyes slightly.

He ziteng...

She had to hold this man tightly in her hands.

“If she could become he ziteng’s girlfriend, what kind of Glory would that be? ”

“After eating the rice noodles, he ziteng went to the base and prepared for work. As soon as he opened the laboratory door, he saw ye Zhuo standing there observing the data. ”

“He ziteng greeted ye Zhuo and said, “Fifth sister-in-law, I had a romantic encounter today!” ”

“Huh?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyes slightly. “What do you mean?”

“”That girl is very beautiful. Most importantly, she has the same taste as me. They both like spicy rice noodles! She also likes to eat double the Chili!”He ziteng liked to eat chili, therefore, he had a very good impression of girls who could eat chili, especially Xu Xiao, who was quite good-looking. ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Then congratulations.” ”

“He ziteng said, “Thank you, fifth sister-in-law. I’ve decided to make another trip tomorrow. If I can see her again tomorrow, it means that she and I are really fated!” ”

“At this moment, there was a knock on the door outside the laboratory. ”

“Come in!”He ziteng said.

“The next second, the door was pushed open. The assistant said anxiously, “Not good, Miss Ye. Something has happened on Mars!” ”
