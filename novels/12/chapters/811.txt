“Now That Ye Langhua was stammering, Xi Weiyue was even more curious. ”

“The XI family’s position in the capital was getting worse by the day. In the afternoon like this, the consequences would be unimaginable. ”

Xi Weiyue looked into the room again before she averted her gaze.

Aunt Lang brought Xi Weiyue to the west wing room.

“The west wing usually did not receive guests. Just like the front hall, the west wing was decorated with antique decorations. In the small living room, there were a total of ten pots of pure white Lily of the valley orchids. ”

“The faint fragrance of flowers lingered on the tip of one’s nose, making one feel relaxed and happy. ”

“XI weiyue smiled and said, “Aunt, the Lily of the valley orchids here are in full bloom. They’re not like the ones I planted. They’re like malnourished ones.” ”

The Lily of the valley was Xiao Banyue’s favorite phrase.

“In order to please Aunt Lang, Xi Weiyue also planted a lot of Lily of the valley. ”

Unfortunately.

There was not a single pot that bloomed.

“No matter how she nurtured it, it would always look malnourished. ”

“Aunt Lang smiled and said, “The Lily of the valley is too delicate. It needs time and effort. To raise this kind of flower, you have to be patient. Haste makes waste.” ”

Haste makes waste?

What did ye Langhua mean by that?

Xi Weiyue narrowed her eyes.

It must be a joke.

“She had been filial to ye Langhua for so many years, and she cared more about her than her own mother. ”

But Ye Langhua acted as if he could not see it.

His conscience had been eaten by a dog.

“Xi Weiyue’s expression changed. She opened the thermos lid and took out a bowl of bird’s nest. “Aunt, try the bird’s nest. I made it myself.” ”

Aunt Lang waved her hand. “I can’t eat it. My appetite hasn’t been good these few days.”

Xi Weiyue’s eyes flashed with displeasure.

“She had come all the way here to give ye Langhua nutritious food. It was fine if ye Langhua wasn’t grateful, but he didn’t even take a bite. ”

“If it wasn’t for that secret and the Shunxi Financial Group, she wouldn’t have bothered with this damn old woman! ”

Xi Weiyue felt that Aunt Lang had no conscience.

No wonder she lost her daughter!

Retribution!

This was retribution!

“Even though she thought so, Xi Weiyue still smiled and said, “Aunt, I asked a friend to buy this bird’s nest overseas. The effect is very good. You can eat a little more or less.” ”

“Hearing Xi Weiyue say so, Aunt Lang picked up the bowl. “Then, I’ll eat a little.” ”

“MMM.”Xi Weiyue nodded.

“The fire of the bird’s nest was just right, so Aunt Lang took a bite. At that moment, the employee Xiao Wang walked in and said, “Aunt Lang, the date cake and sugar cake are ready. Should we send them in, or do you want to send them in?” ”

Aunt Lang put down the bowl. “I’ll do it.”

“Xi Weiyue narrowed her eyes and stood up. “Aunt, you haven’t finished your bird’s nest yet. Why Don’t I Go?”Xi Weiyue was really curious about who the guest in the private room was! ”

“”No need, I’ll go.” ”

Aunty Lang did not give Xi Weiyue the chance.

Xi Weiyue looked at Aunty Lang’s back and frowned.

Could it be that the person sitting in the private room was really someone from the Shunxi Financial Group?

Aunty Lang carried the date cake and sugar cake to the private room.

“Ye Zhuo looked at Aunty Lang and smiled. “Aunty Lang, the old duck fan soup you made is really too delicious! I’ve never eaten such delicious old duck fan soup before.” ”

Aunt Lang placed the date cake and sugar cake on the table. “This old duck was raised in the countryside. It eats fish and snails. It drinks water naturally. The meat is firm and has been raised for a long time. It’s definitely better than the feed duck in the farm.”

“I see.”

“Aunt Lang continued, “Zhuozhuo, try this date cake and sugar cake. After you finish these, there are two more servings of sweet soup.”Knowing that ye Zhuo liked to eat desserts, aunt lang asked someone to make a lot of desserts. ”

“Ye Zao picked up a piece of sugar cake, and it melted when he took a sip. There was a refreshing fragrance similar to that of plums in his mouth. “It’s very delicious!” ”

Aunt Lang was full of smiles.

Ye Zao stuffed the remaining half of the sugar cake into Cen Shaoqing’s mouth. “Try it and see if it tastes good.”

Aunt Lang was stunned.

“If she remembered correctly, Cen Shaoqing didn’t eat sweet things. ”

Would Cen Shaoqing get angry at Ye Zhuo?

The next second.

Aunt Lang was stunned.

“Cen Shaoqing did not get angry. Instead, he smiled and said, “It’s delicious. Aunt Lang’s culinary skills have always been good.” ”

Aunt Lang was stunned.

She did not find it strange anymore. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“After all, Cen Shaoqing did not even eat vegetables for ye Zhuo. What was a mouthful of dessert? ”

Xi Weiyue came to the courtyard and tiptoed to observe the situation inside.

“However, because of the beaded curtains, she could only see a rough outline. From the outline, the other party should be a man. ”

Who Was It?

Xi Weiyue narrowed her eyes.

“At this moment, Xiao Wang came to water the lilies in the courtyard. ”
