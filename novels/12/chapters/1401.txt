“”Old man, calm down!”Xie wanqiu grabbed Zhou Zuolong’s wrist, “Jinbei didn’t come today. Maybe he has something to do! Breaking off ties is not something that can be said casually. What if it hurts the child’s Heart?” ”

“Xie rongle also quickly walked forward. “Aunt is right. Uncle, please calm down.” ”

Calm down?

How could the current Zhou Zuolong still be calm?

“This unfilial son, if he dared to do this now, when he got old and could not walk, wouldn’t he become even worse? ! ”

“”Cut ties, we have to cut ties!” ”

“Zhou Zuolong was really angry. Even his niece, Xie Rongle, knew that she had come from thousands of miles away to see Xie wanqiu, but what about Zhou Jinbei? ”

“He was clearly in the capital, but he did not even show his face! ”

“”Grandfather, why don’t we give uncle another chance and see if uncle will come tomorrow? If Uncle Comes Tomorrow, we will forgive him.”Zheng Wanyin walked over, she smiled and said, “It is said that the prime minister can hold a boat in his belly. With your talent, grandfather, if you were in ancient times, you would at least be a grand prime minister!” ”

“Zheng Wanyin’s words made Zhou zuolong calm down a little, “Alright, then I’ll give Yinyin some face. For now, I won’t lower myself to the level of that unfilial son. If I don’t see him before 10 o’clock tomorrow morning, don’t blame me for not respecting the relationship between father and Son!” ”

“”Grandfather, I’ll thank you on behalf of Uncle!”Zheng Wanyin said. ”

Zhou Zuolong snorted coldly.

“Xie wanqiu looked at Zheng Wanyin. “Yinyin, it’s getting late. Take your cousin to the hotel to rest first.” ”

“Okay.”Zheng Wanyin nodded.

“Xie rongle said, “Auntie, I’ll accompany you.” ”

“Xie wanqiu smiled and said, “You silly child, it’s not like there’s no tomorrow. It’s the same if you come to accompany me tomorrow.” ”

“”Alright then.”Xie rongle nodded. “I’ll leave with Yinyin first. Aunty, uncle, the two of you should rest early too.” ”

“After the two of them left, Xie Wanqiu turned to look at Zhou Zuolong. “You drank quite a lot tonight, didn’t you?” ”

“Zhou zuolong said, “I got along well with brother Wu, so I drank a little more.” ”

“When drinking, one should drink a thousand cups less. ”

Zhou Zuolong and Wu Youyu even hated the fact that they had met late.

“Xie wanqiu smiled and said, “Old Man, what do you think of Rong Le?” ”

“He’s pretty good.”Zhou Zuolong nodded.

Xie wanqiu sighed. “It’s a pity that this child has a tough life. He lost his husband at a young age and is still alone.”

“Zhou zuolong said, “Children and grandchildren have their own blessings. It’s useless for you to worry too much. Maybe Rong le already has a suitable person by his side.” ”

“Hearing this, a dark light flashed in Xie Wanqiu’s eyes. ”

It’s useless to worry too much?

It turned out that Xie Rongle was not Zhou Zuolong’s biological niece.

“If Xie Rongle was Zhou Zuolong’s biological niece, he would definitely not stand idly by! ”

“Xie wanqiu continued, “Old man, have you heard of a saying?” ”

“What is it?”Zhou Zuolong asked.

“”Whether you’re poor or not depends on your children and grandchildren. Whether you’re rich or not depends on your wife,”Xie Wanqiu said. ”

Whether you are poor or not depends on your children and grandchildren. Whether you are rich or not depends on your wife.

“Zhou Zuolong agreed with this statement. If he had not married Xie wanqiu, how could he have such a good life? ”

“Therefore, Zhou Zuolong was very grateful to Xie wanqiu. ”

Xie Wanqiu was a good husband.

“After saying that, Xie wanqiu continued, “The wife of Jin bei is obviously not a good person. Jin bei has not come to see you for a long time. She must have a part in this!” ”

Zhou Zuolong’s face immediately darkened when he heard that. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Xie Wanqiu was right. The reason why Zhou Jinbei became like this was definitely because Chu Ying was trying to sow discord between them.

“Otherwise, the father and son wouldn’t have gotten to this point. ”

“I knew that this Chu Ying wasn’t a good person when I saw her back then! But that unfilial son was like a dog that had bitten a meat bun. He wouldn’t let go no matter what!”

“Xie wanqiu said, “A virtuous daughter-in-law can support a family. Similarly, a corrupt daughter-in-law can also ruin a family. “As the mother of Jin bei, I really can’t bear to see everything that Jin bei has built up over the years being ruined by Chu Ying Just Like That!” ”

“At the end of her sentence, Xie Wanqiu’s eyes turned red. ”

Zhou Zuolong sighed. “That unfilial son has a mother like you. I don’t know how many lifetimes he’s been blessed with. It’s a pity that he doesn’t know his blessings when he’s blessed!”

“Xie wanqiu continued, “Old man, they say it’s not too late to make amends. After all, Jinbei is my child. Although he’s not blood-related, in my eyes, he’s like my own. I really can’t sit idly by and watch. Coincidentally, Rong Le, that child, is here as well. Rong Le, that child, has been sensible since he was young. He’s a diligent and thrifty housekeeper... “... “...” ”

“Before Xie Wanqiu could finish her sentence, Zhou Zuolong understood her intention. “WANQIU, do you mean to let Rongle follow Bei?” ”

“Yes.”Xie wanqiu nodded. “I just don’t know if Jinbei will like Rongle.”

“Hearing this, Zhou Zuolong was a little displeased. “Not like? What’s there to dislike about him? Rongle is only in his thirties this year. It’s his fortune that Rongle likes him!” ”

Xie Rongle was Xie Wanqiu’s niece.

“Xie wanqiu was virtuous and virtuous, and Xie Rongle was definitely not that bad either. Zhou Jinbei being able to marry Xie Rongle was a blessing that he had cultivated for countless lifetimes. ”

“When he finished speaking, Zhou Zuolong continued, “Did you tell Rong Le about this? How did Rong Le React?” ”

What he was most worried about now was that Xie Ronghua would not agree.

“Xie wanqiu smiled and said, “Jinbei is 17 years older than Rong Le. At first, Rong Le was a little unhappy, but after I told her about the stakes involved, she agreed! “Rong Le is a good child. I believe that she and Jinbei will definitely make their lives better!” ”

“”Yes.”Zhou Zuolong nodded. “When that unfilial son comes over tomorrow, I’ll tell him about this matter. If he dares to say no, I’ll destroy his reputation!” ”

“Xie wanqiu said, “Old man, although this child Jinbei is a little rebellious, I believe that he is still very rational when it comes to dealing with matters of right and wrong. He will definitely understand our painstaking efforts.” ”

“After returning to the hotel, Zheng Wanyin dialed Zhou Xiang’s number. ”

“Second aunt.”

“”Wanyin, your uncle didn’t go over today. is your grandfather very angry?”Zhou Xiang asked somewhat nervously. ”

“Zheng wanyin said, “Yes, grandfather is very angry. If grandmother didn’t stop him, grandfather would have published the newspaper and cut off the relationship between father and son with uncle.”Zheng Wanyin especially emphasized that ‘publishing the newspaper’. Once it was published.., zhou Jinbei’s reputation would be ruined. ”

“If he couldn’t even support his parents and show filial piety to the elderly, what right did he have to be a character that touched China? ”

“When she heard this, Zhou Xiang’s eyebrows jumped. Fortunately, Xie Wanqiu was there to stop him. ”

“Zheng wanyin continued, “Second aunt, under grandmother’s pleading, grandfather is willing to wait another day. If uncle still doesn’t come tomorrow, he will really sever his relationship with uncle!” ”

“When she heard this, Zhou Xiang hurriedly said, “Wanyin, don’t worry. I will plead with your uncle to not do anything stupid.” ”

“”Second aunt,”zheng wanyin said, “Grandpa also said that he must see Uncle Before 10 o’clock tomorrow morning.” ”

“Got it.”

“After hanging up, Xie Rongle immediately went forward and asked, “What did Zhou Xiang Say?” ”

“Zheng wanyin smiled and said, “She was so scared that her voice trembled. Cousin, don’t worry. My uncle will definitely rush to the hospital before 10 o’clock tomorrow morning. When that time comes, you’ll just be responsible for dressing up beautifully!” ”

“Hearing this, Xie Rongle’s face lit up with a smug smile. ”

“From now on, she would also become the wife of a rich family. ”

“On the other side, Zhou Xiang rushed to Zhou Jinbei’s bedroom. ”

“Once Zhou Xiang arrived, Zhou Jinbei guessed her intentions. ”

“”Sister, if you still want to persuade me to go to the hospital, there’s no need to say it.” ”

“Zhou Xiang frowned, “Jinbei, stop being so stubborn!”! “Wan Yin called me just now. She said that dad almost broke off his relationship with you in the newspaper today. Luckily, mom stopped him. No matter what, you have to go to the hospital to see Mom and Dad before 10 o’clock tomorrow morning!” ”

“Zhou Jinbei yawned. “SIS, I’m going to bed. You should go to bed early too.” ”

“With that, he slammed the door shut. ”

“No matter how hard Zhou Xiang banged on the door, Zhou Jinbei refused to open it. ”

“In the blink of an eye, it was ten o’clock in the morning the next day. ”

“Zhou Zuolong had been waiting at the hospital for Zhou Jinbei to kowtow to him and admit his mistake, but Zhou Jinbei did not appear. ”

“”Yinyin, contact the newspaper office and the reporters immediately!”Zhou Zuolong turned to look at Zheng Wanyin. ”

“Xie wanqiu said, “Old Man! What are you doing!” ”

“Zhou zuolong said, “I want to sever my relationship with that unfilial son!” ”
