“Then I’ll rely on uncle Zheng’s good words.”

“Zheng Beiyang knew very well why Liu Caiyi was looking for him today, he then said, “Caiyi, the higher-ups think highly of you. During the general meeting to elect the next president, Second Elder and I recommended you, so the position of President will definitely be yours. You Don’t have to worry.””

Zheng Beiyang’s words turned into a reassurance that made Liu Caiyi let go of the huge rock that was weighing on her heart.

“Liu caiyi smiled and said, “Thank you, Uncle Zheng, for your praise.””

“Zheng Beiyang said, “This was also exchanged with your hard work and talent.””

“He had only helped to say a few words. In the end, Liu Caiyi was the one with the talent.”

“If Liu Caiyi did not know anything, it would be useless for him to say ten thousand good words in front of his superiors.”

“Liu Caiyi drank the tea in the cup in one gulp. She picked up a beautifully wrapped gift box from the chair beside her and handed it to Zheng Beiyang, “Uncle Zheng, I heard that Yuanyuan’s birthday is coming soon. This is a birthday present I prepared for Yuanyuan. It’s a small gift. Please accept it, uncle Zheng.””

Zheng Beiyang had an only daughter named Zheng Yuanyuan. She was 12 years old this year.

“The little girl was at the age where she loved to look beautiful, so Liu Caiyi prepared a set of jewelry.”

“Zheng Beiyang pushed the gift box back in front of Liu Caiyi. “It’s just a child’s birthday. Caiyi, you don’t have to make it so grand.””

“”It’s not anything valuable. Please accept it, uncle Zheng.”Liu Caiyi pushed the gift box back in front of Zheng Beiyang.”

“Seeing that he couldn’t refuse, Zheng Beiyang had no choice but to accept it. He opened the box and took a look.”

His eyes were filled with shock.

He saw a set of diamond jewelry lying in the box.

“Judging from the size of the diamonds, they were all collector’s items.”

They were all given diamonds.

Liu Caiyi still said that it wasn’t anything valuable?

It seemed that the Liu family was indeed a big family!

“Liu Caiyi seemed to have seen the shock in Zheng Beiyang’s eyes. She stood up and said, “Uncle Zheng, I have something else to do in the afternoon. Please excuse me.””

“After saying that, Liu Caiyi turned around and left.”

She didn’t even give Zheng Beiyang a chance to reject her. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Zheng Beiyang watched Liu Caiyi’s back as she left. He had no choice but to take the gift box and leave the teahouse.

A week passed very quickly.

Lin Qingxuan brought Xia Xiaoman back to the country.

“Although they had only been away for two months, during these two months, the two of them had visited many countries. Even their skin had become darker.”

Especially Xia Xiaoman. Her snow-white skin had turned into a wheat-colored color.

“The two of them came back early. Without informing anyone, they took a taxi to Mian Xiu manor after getting off the plane.”

“When they arrived at the east courtyard, Lin Jin Cheng was tending to the blooming Lily of the valley in the courtyard.”

“Lin Qingxuan dragged his suitcase to Lin Jin Cheng and said with a smile, “Jin Cheng.””

“When he saw Lin Qingxuan, Lin Jincheng thought he was hallucinating. “Fourth brother? Fourth Sister-in-law! Fourth Brother, didn’t you say you would be back tomorrow? Why are you back today!””

“He originally wanted to go to the airport to pick up Lin Qingxuan Tomorrow, but he didn’t expect Lin Qingxuan to come back early!”

“Lin qingxuan smiled and said, “Your fourth sister-in-law and I want to give you a surprise. By the way, where are sister-in-law and the others?””

“Lin Jincheng said, “Ah Shu has gone to work and hasn’t come back yet. The children are upstairs. I’ll get someone to call them.”After saying that, Lin Jincheng instructed the servants to go upstairs to call for people.”

“Xia Xiaoman looked at Lin Jincheng and continued, “Father Zhonghua, our Lizi has troubled you and Ah Shu during this period of time.””

“Lin Jincheng smiled and said, “Fourth sister-in-law, you’re treating us as strangers when you say that! Lizi is my niece. Ah Shu and I are aunts and uncles. Isn’t it normal for us to help take care of the children for a few days?””

“Lin Qingxuan said, “Jincheng is right. A family shouldn’t talk about two families.””

“When Xia Xiaoman first decided to marry Lin Qingxuan, a big reason was actually due to a few brothers and sisters-in-law of the Lin family.”

“At that time, other than Old Lady Lin, everyone in the Lin family especially welcomed her.”

“Especially the few sisters-in-law of the Lin family, they were especially warm to her.”

“If the members of the Lin family were like Old Lady Lin, she definitely wouldn’t have chosen Lin Qingxuan.”

Looking at it now.

“Her choice back then wasn’t wrong, and neither was her marriage.”

“Lin Jincheng continued, “Fourth brother and fourth sister-in-law, don’t just stand there in the courtyard. Quickly enter the house and sit down! Oh right, you guys haven’t eaten yet, right? I’ll let you eat to cook.””

“Lin Qingxuan said, “We’ve eaten outside, you don’t have to be busy.””

“Just then, an Lizi rushed down from upstairs. When she saw the people downstairs, she said in surprise, “Mom! Uncle Lin, you’re back!””
