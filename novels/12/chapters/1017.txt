“Lin Ze smiled and said, “There’s no class this afternoon, so I came to help mom.””

“”OH.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. As he shifted his gaze, he saw that there was actually a small red mole on Lin Ze’s right hand. He could not help but sigh in his heart that genes were really too powerful!”

It seemed that it was not unreasonable for elder Zhang and the others to suspect that Ye Shu was Aunt Lang’s daughter.

“”Brother, I have something to tell you,”ye Zhuo continued.”

She and Lin Ze were brother and sister. Lin Ze had the right to know some things.

“Moreover, Lin Ze was his brother.”

“Lin Ze asked, “What is it?””

“You’ll know when you come over.”Ye Zhuo turned around and walked out of the door.

Lin Ze followed ye Zhuo’s footsteps.

“The two of them came to the outside of the shop and found a place to rest. Only then did ye zhuo speak, “Brother, do you know Aunt Lang?””

“Lin Ze had grown up in Beijing since he was young, so he knew a little about Aunt Lang. “Yes, why?””

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Our mother might be Aunt Lang’s lost daughter.””

“What did you say?”Lin Ze stood up in surprise.

“”Brother, don’t get excited. This is just a guess.”Ye Zhuo then told Lin ze about Cao Wei and elder Zhang coming to find her.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Lin Ze frowned. “But isn’t mom their biological daughter?”

“Ye Zhuo explained, “Cao Wei went to Yunjing to investigate. Actually, Grandpa and Grandma’s real daughter died in an accident. However, one day, their daughter came back, so the elders suspected that Xi Muwen brought mom to Yunjing to replace the dead child.””

This was the only way to not be discovered.

“Does mom know about this?”Lin Ze asked.

“Ye Zhuo shook his head. “She doesn’t know yet. Don’t tell her either. Wait until the truth is out before you tell her. Otherwise, it’ll be for nothing.””

“Okay.”Lin Ze nodded. “I got it.”

“After confirming that ye Shu also had a small red mole on her hand, Ye Zhuo told elder Zhang about this on wechat.”

Elder Zhang was especially excited when he received the wechat message.

“Cao Wei! Cao Wei!”

“Cao Wei jogged over. “What’s wrong, elder Zhang?””

“Elder Zhang continued, “A small red mole! Miss ye told me that Madam Lin also has an identical small red mole on her hand!””

“”That’s Great!”Cao Wei continued, “Madam Lin is definitely a real half a month old!””

Elder Zhang held Cao Wei’s hand. “But we can’t be happy too early. We haven’t done the paternity test yet!”

Ye Zhuo had already begun to investigate ye Shu and Little Half Moon’s information.

Thirty-six years had passed. It was not easy to thoroughly investigate how Little Half Moon had disappeared and how ye Shu had gone to Yun capital to become ye Dahai’s daughter!

“In the blink of an eye, two days had passed.”

“During these two days, Xi Weiyue had been waiting at home for news from the financial world.”

“However, ever since Aunt Lang had handed over the recommendation letter, there had been no news from the financial world.”

Could it be...

That something had gone wrong?

“Xi Weiyue raised her brows slightly. There were some things that she could not directly ask Aunt Lang, so Xi Weiyue had no choice but to find Jiang Yan.”

“”Weiyue, why are you looking for me?””

“Xi Weiyue braced herself and called Jiang Yan “Sister”, then said, “It’s already been two days, and there’s still no news from the financial world. Help me find out about the old lady.””

Jiang Yan nodded. “Okay.”

“Back in the room, Jiang Yan said, “Mom, that recommendation letter of yours has already been sent out for two days, why is there still no news? Did that elder Zhang not send it to you at all?””

“”Don’t worry, elder Zhang is not that kind of person.”Aunt Lang had been in contact with the elder for many years. She believed that elder Zhang was not the kind of person who would go back on his words.”

“Jiang Yan continued, “But Weiyue did not receive an invitation letter from the financial world! Why don’t I accompany you to ask?””

“Aunt Lang hesitated for a moment, then nodded. “Sure.””

Aunt Lang came to elder Zhang’s hotel.

“Seeing Aunt Lang come over, elder Zhang smiled and said, “Lang Hua, you’re here! I was just about to look for you! Oh right, who is this?””

“Aunt Lang held Jiang Yan’s arm and said, “Elder Zhang, this is my daughter, Little Half Moon. Little Half Moon, this is elder Zhang.””

“Jiang Yan smiled and greeted, “Hello, elder Zhang.””

“Elder Zhang Glanced at Jiang Yan and frowned without a trace, then nodded to Jiang Yan. “Come in and have a seat!””

The two of them walked into the living room.

Elder Zhang poured a cup of tea for the two of them.

“Aunt Lang took the tea with both hands. “Elder Zhang, I’m here today because I have something to ask you.””
