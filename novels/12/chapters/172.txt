Chapter 173: 086: Prison for murder! A big shot in the business world! 1

After saying this, an lizi continued, “We have to let him leave with nothing! Also, we can’t keep this supermarket open any longer. Let’s convert it into cash!”

This was what ye Zao had specifically instructed an Lizi.

Once Xia Xiaoman agreed to the divorce, they had to immediately transfer out the supermarket that their family was currently opening.

If the supermarket was still there, an Dongliang would definitely pester Xia Xiaoman all the time.

Such people were the type of people one feared the most when doing business.

Xia Xiaoman was stunned. She did not understand what an Lizi said.

An Lizi explained the reason to Xia Xiaoman. Xia Xiaoman nodded in agreement when she heard this. “Lizi, what your classmate said makes sense!”

She was worried that Xia Xiaoman would let her imagination run wild, an lizi continued, “Mom, don’t worry. Even if we get divorced, with your abilities, we can still live very well! That classmate of mine doesn’t have a father either. I think her mother takes care of herself very young! So, Mom, don’t be sad and don’t be sad. This is a good thing for us!”

Since her daughter was so strong, she naturally couldn’t be too weak.

Xia Xiaoman nodded. “Okay.”

As she said this, an Lizi thought of what ye Zhuo had said. “Mom, if we want him to leave the supermarket empty-handed, we have to bear with it for the time being. At least until the supermarket is successfully transferred out!”

This ‘he’was naturally referring to an dongliang.

Xia Xiaoman naturally understood the meaning behind an Lizi’s words. “Don’t worry, Lizi. There’s no need to bear with it. As long as I want, the supermarket can be transferred out tomorrow.”

......

Xia Xiaoman had been in business for so many years and knew many of her bosses.

There were many people who wanted to take over the supermarket.

“Really?”An Lizi’s eyes lit up.

Xia Xiaoman nodded.

An lizi continued, “Mom, let’s go to the hospital now.”

The house was equipped with surveillance cameras. With the surveillance footage, the injury assessment, and the evidence of an Dongliang’s infidelity, it would be much easier to go to the court to sue for divorce!

The mother and daughter arrived at the hospital.

The wound on Xia Xiaoman’s head did not seem to be very serious, but she had received a few stitches.

An Lizi was in so much pain that she regretted not bringing a beer bottle to the back of an Dongliang’s head!

Xia Xiaoman held an Lizi’s hand. “Lizi, mom is fine, you don’t have to worry.”

Although Xia Xiaoman had received a few stitches to her head, she did not choose to stay in the hospital. She prescribed some medicine and received the injury assessment report before bringing an Lizi home.

Xia Xiaoman was a very strong person. The next day, she contacted the person who wanted to take over the supermarket and discussed the transfer.

The other party was called Wang Daqiang, 42 years old this year. He was very strong and had known Xia Xiaoman for many years

“Xiaoman, you’ve been running this supermarket for 12 years. Are you really willing to transfer it to me?”

Xia Xiaoman smiled and said, “Do you think I’m joking with you? It’s been 12 years. I’m too tired. I want to have a good rest.”

Wang Daqiang and Xia Xiaoman had known each other for so many years. Naturally, he knew that Xia Xiaoman was a smart and capable woman. He said enviously, “Your husband is really lucky to have married you!”

Xia Xiaoman smiled and didn’t reply.

“By the way, can the transfer fee really be any lower?”Wang Daqiang continued to ask.

Xia Xiaoman continued to say, “I have more than two million worth of goods here. Adding this three-story house, you won’t lose out on 35 million! If it wasn’t for the urgent transfer, I really wouldn’t be willing to sell it for 35 million.”

Xia Xiaoman bought this house herself.

Twelve years ago, the house price in Yun Jing wasn’t as scary as it was now. She only spent 100,000 yuan to buy this house.

After living for so many years, she had developed feelings for him.

If it wasn’t for this incident, Xia Xiaoman wouldn’t have been willing to sell it.

“Alright!”Wang Daqiang thought about it in his heart. “35 million then! When are we going to go through the transfer procedures?”

Wang Daqiang was not a fool.

He knew that the value of this supermarket was far more than 35 million! Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Just this house alone had been sold for 16 million. Moreover, the supermarket’s business was so good that he really did not lose out on 35 million.

“Let’s Go Now,”Xia Xiaoman said.

Wang Daqiang was a little surprised that Xia Xiaoman was so anxious, but he did not ask further. “Okay, let’s go then.”

After completing the transfer procedures, the next day, Xia Xiaoman brought an Lizi and left the house that they had lived in for more than ten years.

They moved into the small villa that they had just bought.

The small Villa’s environment was elegant, and it was especially close to North Bridge High School.

On the third day after they moved in, an Lizi invited ye Zhuo and Zhao Pingting over as guests.

Ye Zhuo and Zhao Pingting arrived as promised.

An Lizi introduced the two to Xia Xiaoman. “Mom, this is Ye Zhuo. You can call her Zhuo Zhuo. This is Zhao Pingting. You can call her Pingting.”
