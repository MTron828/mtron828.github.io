“Thank you.”Aunt Lang brought little half moon to her seat.

Miracle Doctor Xu looked at Little Half Moon. “Give me your hand.”

“Little Half Moon acted as if she didn’t hear what Miracle Doctor Xu said. She continued to eat her lollipop, with a silly smile on her face. ”

“Aunt Lang imitated Yang Jiao’s method and said with a smile, “Little Half Moon, give me your hand and let Miracle Doctor Xu take a look. Later, Mommy will bring you to buy candy, okay?” ”

Little Half Moon’s eyes lit up and she immediately stretched out her hand.

“Miracle Doctor Xu took Little Half Moon’s pulse. After a moment, he let go of Little Half Moon’s hand and continued, “If I’m not mistaken, this lady’s illness is the aftereffects of being frightened when she was three years old.” ”

“In fact, Jiang Yan did not have any problems at all now. She did not have aftereffects when she was three years old. All of this was just a conspiracy between Yang Jiao and Miracle Doctor Xu in advance. Otherwise, how would miracle doctor Xu Win Ye Langhua’s Trust? ”

“”Yes, yes, yes! Miracle Doctor, you’re absolutely right!”Aunt Lang continued, “Then, is there any chance for my daughter to recover now?” ”

“Miracle Doctor Xu smiled and said, “I can’t guarantee it with others, but with me, I, Xu, I can definitely return you a healthy daughter!” ” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Really?”Aunt Lang was overjoyed.

“This sentence made miracle doctor Xu’s face turn black. “Trust is the most basic affirmation for a doctor! If you don’t believe me, you can go to another doctor!” ”

“Xiao Wang! Let the next patient in!”

“Aunt Lang quickly stood up and said, “Miracle Doctor Xu, you misunderstood me! I don’t mean to distrust you! If we didn’t trust you, we wouldn’t have found you!” ”

Miracle Doctor Xu’s expression eased up a little. “Then you guys go and handle the hospitalization procedures now. The patient will need to stay in the hospital for half a month before he can fully recover!”

“”Okay, okay! I’ll go now! Thank you, Doctor Xu!” ”

“After thanking her, Aunt Lang led little half a month out. ”

“As soon as they walked outside, Yang Jiao immediately stood up and asked, “Sister, what did the Doctor Say?” ”

“Aunt Lang said excitedly, “Miracle doctor Xu said that he will go through the hospitalization procedures first. He will be able to make little half a month recover in fifteen days!” ”

“Really?”Xu Jiao pretended to be very surprised.

“”Really!”Aunt Lang nodded and continued, “Where is Wei Yue?” ”

“Xu Jiao said, “She went to the bathroom. Let’s go through the hospitalization procedures now! I will send a message to let her know in a while.” ”

“Okay.”

The three of them went to go through the hospitalization procedures.

The clinic was not big. There were only three wards.

“After the procedures were successfully completed, little half a month went to the ward. ”

“Then, it was a long fifteen days of treatment. ”

“It had to be said that miracle doctor Xu’s medical skills were very good. Under his treatment, Xiao Banyue’s condition became better and better. Her mental state became clearer and clearer day by day. ”

“After fifteen days, Xiao Banyue was completely normal. ”

“During these fifteen days of interaction, her relationship with Aunt Lang gradually eased. On this day, when she came back from the outside, Aunt Lang actually heard Xiao Banyue call her mother. ”

Aunt Lang was instantly stunned and couldn’t react for a long time. “What... What did you call me?”

“Jiang Yan looked at Aunt Lang’s face and said with red eyes, “Mom!” ”

36 years.

“After 36 years, she finally had a taste of her own medicine. ”

“Jiang Yan ran over and hugged Aunt Lang. “Mom, I’m sorry! It was all my fault. I shouldn’t have treated you like that. I made you sad...” ”

“”It’s okay, silly child. Those things are in the past!”Aunt Lang hugged Jiang Yan tightly. “I’m happy as long as you’re fine now.” ”

“Mom!”Jiang Yan burst into tears.

“After a long while, the mother and daughter let go of each other. ”

“Jiang Yan sniffed, then, she said, “Mom, it’s all thanks to Auntie and my dad that I’m here today. Especially Auntie. During the days when I was muddle-headed, she treated me better than my own daughter! We should thank her properly!” ”

“”En, you’re right. We should thank them properly.”Auntie Lang nodded. ”

“Jiang Yan narrowed her eyes, then she said, “When I was confused, I heard sister Weiyue say that she wants to join the Shunxi Financial Group. Mom, I want to ask you, are you really not related to the Shunxi Financial Group? If you can help sister Weiyue, please help her! “Let’s return the favor we owe her!” ”

“Hearing this, Aunt Lang was stunned. ”

“Jiang Yan sighed, “If you have nothing to do with the Shunxi Financial Group, then forget it. Let’s find another way to thank sister Weiyue!” ”
