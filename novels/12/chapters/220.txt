“If they could work together for a long time, it would be a huge sum of money. ”

It would be a lie to say that he wasn’t jealous!

Xu Dadong only regretted that he didn’t persist with Ye Sen.

“If he hadn’t left at that time, this contract might have been his! ”

Sigh!

It was useless to say anything now.

“Then congratulations!”Xu Dadong only managed to react after a long time.

“”Thank you. I’ll treat you to Dinner Tonight,”ye Sen said. ”

“Xu Dadong continued, “There’s no need for dinner. I’m just curious, how did you guys manage to get the Toaeon Cooperation Case?” ”

Ye Sen was a talented person!

“But with his ability, getting TOAEON’s cooperation case was still a little risky. ”

“Ye Sen smiled, “You know me. I only know a few simple sentences in English. This cooperation is mainly between my niece and Mr. Embert.” ”

“Your niece?”Xu Dadong was even more incredulous.

Ye Sen nodded.

“Xu Dadong was even more incredulous. He continued, “Your niece, that little girl. Is she an adult?” ”

“”She’s already 19!”The eldest niece was so amazing. As an uncle, Ye Sen was also honored. ”

Xu Dadong just looked at Ye Sen.

Both?

Shouldn’t they use ‘talent’?

She was only 19 years old!

A 19-year-old girl was actually so amazing!

“Actually, when Xu Dadong was talking to ye Zao, he realized that this little girl, ye Zao, was not simple. An ordinary little girl did not have her reaction and eloquence! ”

“However, he did not expect that ye Zao could actually win the cooperation case. ”

The younger generation was really formidable!

“This time, Xu Dadong was completely convinced! ”

“After saying that, Ye Sen continued, “President Xu, your daughter should be about the same age as my eldest nephew, right?” ”

“Xu Dadong’s daughter was indeed about the same age as ye Zao, but her strength was not just a little bit inferior. Thinking of his daughter who had been asking him for money all day, Xu Dadong silently shed sad tears. ”

People could not be compared.

...

On the other side.

Beijing.

“It was not until dinner that old Mrs. Lin remembered Feng Qianhua, she quickly turned to aunt Zhang and said, “Qianhua and Xianxian must still be looking for Ah Ze! Quickly call her and tell her that Ah Ze has been found. Tell her not to worry!” ”

“”Yes, Old Lady.”Although she did not say anything, Aunt Zhang was very angry in her heart. ”

She felt that it was not worth it for Feng Qianhua.

What the hell!

“Feng Qianhua was so good to her, asking about her well-being and making health soup for her every day, but she only thought of Feng Qianhua Now! ”

How heartless!

“After hanging up the phone, Aunt Zhang walked over with an ugly expression. “Not good, Madam...” ”

“Seeing her like this, Old Madam Lin was also shocked. “What’s wrong? Did something happen to Qianhua?” ”

Aunt Zhang shook her head. “Miss Qianhua is fine...”

“Hearing that Feng Qianhua was fine, old madam Lin heaved a sigh of relief. “It’s good that Qianhua is fine.” ”

“Aunt Zhang continued, “The person who was in trouble was Xianxian. Miss Qianhua said on the phone that Xianxian was accidentally hit by a car in order to find the young master!” ”

Hit by a car?

“Hearing this, Old Madam Lin turned pale with fright and immediately stood up from her chair. “What’s going on?” ”

“Aunt Zhang continued, “I’m not too sure about the specifics either. Miss Qianhua said on the phone that Xianxian is still being treated! She was afraid that you would be worried, so she specifically told me not to tell you! But if I don’t tell you about this, my conscience will be uneasy! After all, Xianxian is in trouble because of young master’s matter... “... “...” ”

“Old Mrs. Lin never expected Feng Xianxian to be in trouble. She continued, “Which hospital are they in now?” ”

“”I think they’re at the city hospital,”answered Aunt Zhang. ”

“Old Mrs. Lin hurriedly said, “Hurry up and contact the driver, Xiao Zheng! I’m going to the city hospital right now!” ”

Lin Ze stood on the second floor.

He looked down at everything that was happening downstairs.

Feng Qianhua and her mother had put on a good show!

“However, no matter how the mother and daughter acted, he would never let Feng Qianhua marry into the family. ”

Never!

Old Madam Lin rushed to the city hospital.

Feng Qianxian was still in the emergency room.

“Feng Qianhua sat on the blue plastic chair outside and cried until she was in tears. “Qianxian, nothing can happen to you. If something happens to you, how Will Mother Live?” ”

“Qianhua!”

Old Madam Lin quickly walked over. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“When she saw Old Madam Lin, Feng Qianhua said in disbelief, “Aunt Lin! Why are you here! It’s not that I don’t want...” ”

“Old Madam Lin interrupted Feng Qianhua and scolded, “You Child! After such a big incident, you still want to hide it from me! Is Xianxian Alright?” ”
