“Chapter 1004: 225: jaw-dropping, not worthy of her! 5”

Not only was it swift and decisive.

“In order to achieve his goal, song Shiyu could also use any means. ”

Take by force.

His hands had never been clean.

Hiding was not song Shiyu’s style.

“”If you like someone, will you chase after them?”Song Shiyu raised his head to look at Bai Jiayu. ”

“Bai Jiayu nodded without hesitation. “Brother song, do I look like the kind of person who wrongs himself? It’s just that I haven’t met anyone that particularly moved me recently. Otherwise, I would have chased after him long ago!” ”

Song Shiyu looked at the beaming Bai Jiayu and a hint of envy suddenly appeared in his eyes.

It was a pity.

He was not Bai Jiayu.

His surname was song.

He was a person who had lived in the shadows since he was young.

He could not see the slightest light.

“”So, Brother Song, What Are You hesitating for? If you like him, then hurry up and chase after him! Besides, you’re Not Young Anymore!” ”

“Speaking up to this point, Bai Jiayu paused for a moment and continued, “If Grandma Song knew about your change, she would definitely be very happy!” ”

“When Old Madam song was still alive, the person she was most worried about was song Shiyu. ”

“She was afraid that after she left, song Shiyu would end up alone. ”

“Now that song Shiyu had finally met his lover and was no longer alone for the rest of his life, Bai Jiayu was genuinely happy for him. ”

“Bai Jiayu continued, “Brother song, if you don’t know how to Chase Girls, I can teach you!” ”

Bai Jiayu had been in many relationships and could be considered a relationship expert.

It was just chasing a girl. It was simply a piece of cake.

“”There’s no need,”song Shiyu’s tone was indifferent. ”

“Seeing that song Shiyu rejected him directly, Bai Jiayu patted his chest and said, “Brother song, although I’m not as good as you in other aspects, when it comes to chasing girls, you really can’t compare to me! Don’t underestimate me!” ”

“I won’t chase after her.”

“Bai Jiayu was stunned. “Are you waiting for her to chase after you? Let me tell you, Brother Song, some girls nowadays are especially reserved. You have to take the initiative!” ”

Song Shiyu’s eyes were so indifferent that there was not a trace of expression. “It has nothing to do with who’s chasing who. It’s me who’s not good enough for her.”

If she was the ultimate good.

Then he was the ultimate evil.

“He was covered in dirt, how could he be good enough for her? ”

The only thing he could do was to protect her.

“When he said the last sentence, Song Shiyu’s eyes were full of self-mockery, and all the light and brightness on his body disappeared in an instant. ”

He was like a star that had suddenly lost its luster.

It lost its luster.

Bai Jiayu was stunned.

He had never seen song Shiyu like this.

He was so humble.

He was so insignificant.

He withdrew all the hostility in his body.

“”Brother song...”for some reason, Bai Jiayu suddenly felt a lump in his throat. ”

He was used to song Shiyu’s overbearing manner. The current song Shiyu made Bai Jiayu very uncomfortable.

His heart felt stifled and very uncomfortable.

The song Shiyu he knew should be an existence that looked down on everything in the world.

“However, in an instant, song Shiyu returned to his original appearance. “Are you done with today’s matters?” ”

Bai Jiayu was stunned for a moment.”... I’m done.”

Song Shiyu handed Bai Jiayu a document. “Give this to CEO du.”

“OH.”Bai Jiayu took the document and walked out.

Only when he reached the door did Bai Jiayu realize that he still hadn’t asked Song Shiyu who the person in his heart was!

It would be impossible to ask him again if he wanted to go back now.

Bai Jiayu narrowed his eyes. He was very curious as to what kind of girl song Shiyu was that could make him so humble.

“According to Song Shiyu’s personality in the past, as long as he liked her, he would do whatever it took to snatch her away. ”

But Now?

He didn’t see any possessiveness in song Shiyu’s eyes just now.

“From the beginning to the end, song Shiyu kept a low profile. ”

Bai Jiayu was now wondering if that scene was a mistake.

That was song Shiyu!

“The young man who killed his father, the vengeful song Shiyu! ”

“Bai Jiayu turned back to look at song Shiyu’s office. After thinking for a long time, he didn’t push open the door. ”

“Since song Shiyu didn’t want to say it, it was useless for him to force it. ”

In the office.

Song Shiyu pulled open the second drawer of his desk and took out a crystal box.

The crystal box was transparent.

One could vaguely see through the layer of crystal that it contained a hairpin.

Du Du —

“At this moment, there was a sudden knock on the door. ” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Song Shiyu put the crystal box back in its place unhurriedly. “Come in.”

Special Assistant Feng pushed the door open and walked in. “Boss.”

“Looking up again, song Shiyu was still the same song Shiyu that no one dared to look at. “Speak.” ”
