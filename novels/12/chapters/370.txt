No one expected ye Zao to be able to handle missions on his phone. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“”Boss, can we watch?”Zheng Yuanjie asked. ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

The three of them quickly walked over.

“Even Dr. Warne, who was usually very serious, sighed. ”

“If he had not seen it with his own eyes, even if it was heaven breaker, he would not believe that someone could use a phone to do missions. ”

“However, not only did ye Zao manage to do it, he did it so quickly! ”

He was too amazing!

It looked like China’s technology was really going to rise up!

“Ten minutes later, ye Zao completed the mission and clicked submit. ”

“Zheng Yuanjie was still a little confused. “Boss, you... you usually use a cell phone to do missions?” ”

“Ye Zao took out his computer from his bag and said, “Look at what type of mission. Just use a cell phone for the normal type of mission just now.” ”

“Ye Zao’s tone was calm and casual, but everyone looked at her with their mouths Agape. ”

Normal?

“It was already SS level, and it was still called normal? ”

“If this could be called a normal mission, then what was difficult? ”

Zheng Yuanjie felt that the boss might have misunderstood the word ‘normal’!

“Not only was Zheng Yuanjie stunned, even Chu Zimo and Dr. Warne were so shocked that they could not react for a long time. ”

The two tasks just now.

“Even if they were in Professor Hua en’s hands, it would still take about two days. ”

The others would need at least one to two months.

But she only used ten minutes.

And she was using a cell phone!

It was really infuriating to compare people.

“Ye Zao had already turned on the computer. He looked up at Professor Hua en and said, “Professor, we can start now.” ”

“Chu Zimo asked curiously, “Boss, I don’t think I’ve seen the brand of your computer before. Where did you buy it?” ”

“”I assembled it myself,”ye Zao answered. ”

“Chu Zimo licked his lips. Although he could assemble a computer, he was still far from ye Zao! ”

A boss was a boss!

Dr. Warne also turned on the computer and the two began to discuss academic issues.

Chu Zimo and Zheng Yuanjie sat at the side and took notes seriously.

“Although Dr. Warne had communicated with ye Zao online before, it was not as shocking as face-to-face communication! ”

Dr. Warne was completely immersed in her voice.

Her understanding of technology was far more profound than he had imagined!

Even the three giants of country P would have to bow their heads in front of her.

“Unknowingly, the sky outside the window turned dark. ”

“Ye Zao closed the computer. “Dr. Warne, shall we call it a day?” ”

“”Okay.”Dr. Warne closed the computer reluctantly and continued, “Your Name, Vimal, is so well-known that it is as if it has penetrated your heart. You have really opened my eyes today!” ”

“”Sorry for making a fool out of me, Professor.” ”

“Chu Zimo put away his laptop and continued, “Big Brother, Professor Warne, it’s getting late. I’ll get someone to bring the food up.” ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “I’ll go back to my room to wash my face first.”

Professor Warne was still immersed in the topic just now. He wanted nothing more than to rush back to the laboratory to conduct the experiment.

...

At the same time.

Mu Yourong also arrived in the capital.

The person who picked her up was Chu Zimo’s little assistant.

“”Miss Mu, this way please.” ”

“The little assistant had never seen such a young member in the world of Science and technology before. For a moment, she was very shocked and worshipped mu yourong. ”

“If she was as amazing as Mu Yourong, she would not have to be an assistant. ”

“Mu Yourong took in the shock of the little assistant. “Xiao Fang, May I ask, is YC also staying in this hotel?” ”

“Yes.”The assistant nodded.

“Then which room is he staying in?”Mu Yourong continued to ask.

“I’m not too sure about that either.”

“Although the assistant was not sure, Mu Yourong still did not give up. She wanted to have a chance encounter with Niu Hulu YC. ”

“Mu Yourong did not even eat dinner. She dressed up meticulously and sat on the first floor of the hotel, intending to meet Niu Hulu YC by chance. ”

“Until nine o’clock in the evening, she did not see anyone who seemed to be Niu Hulu YC passing by. ”

Not only did she not meet Niu Hulu YC.

“Instead, she met an unexpected person. ”

Ye Zao.

Mu Yourong frowned.

Why would ye Zao appear here?

Could it be that Miao Yin was up to something again?

“When she thought of the next time they met, she and ye Zao would not be from the same world. Mu Yourong’s eyes were filled with pride. ”

...

“At night, everyone went to sleep. ”

Ye Zao wore a silk nightgown with a sling as he sat in front of the computer desk and busied himself.

“In front of her, other than the computer, there was also a transparent screen. Ye Zao’s fingertips continuously clicked on the screen. ”
