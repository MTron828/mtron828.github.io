Ye Zhuo nodded. “I know.”

“Ye Sen continued, “I’m going to talk about a collaboration tomorrow. I might be back late at night.” ”

“Okay.”

...

The next day.

“Ye Sen first went to the company. After settling the company’s matters, he drove to the coffee shop that he had arranged to meet. ”

“Because they were talking about cooperation, Ye Sen drove the company’s car. ”

A Black Mercedes-benz.

“After a while, he arrived at the agreed restaurant, opened the door and got out. ”

“To show his sincerity, ye Sen specially came 30 minutes earlier. When he arrived, the person in charge of the other company had not arrived yet. ”

“Ye Sen ordered a cup of coffee. As he drank the coffee, he looked at the scenery outside the window. ”

“Ye Sen didn’t realize that his ex-girlfriend and her current boyfriend, Wang Chenglei, were sitting not far from his table! Although he didn’t notice them, Li Yiyi noticed ye Sen immediately. ”

“Why is he here?”Li Yiyi looked in ye Sen’s direction and frowned in disgust.

It was obvious that ye Sen must be here because of her.

“Ye Sen was too tasteless. They had already broken up for so many days, yet he still refused to let go! ”

Was this interesting?

It was really disgusting!

“”Baby, who are you talking about?”Wang Chenglei turned to look at Li Yiyi. ”

“Li Yiyi lifted her chin. “Brother Wang, Look over there!” ”

“When he saw Ye Sen, Wang Chenglei immediately frowned. “Why is this poor guy haunting me! Doesn’t he know that you’re My Woman Now?” ”

“Li Yiyi pouted and continued, “Brother Wang, don’t be angry! I’ll go and explain it to him right now!” ”

Wang Chenglei’s expression was very ugly. “You Go! What a Downer!”

Li Yiyi walked over to Ye Sen’s side.

“Hearing the footsteps, Ye Sen thought that the person who came was the person in charge of the company. When he looked up, he saw that the person was a woman with heavy makeup. ”

This is...

“Ye Sen thought for a long time before he remembered that this was his ex-girlfriend, Li Yiyi! ”

“What’s the matter?”Ye Sen asked.

“Li Yiyi looked at Ye Sen with a mocking look in her eyes. “Stop pretending! Ye Sen, do you think I don’t know what you mean? Let me tell you, it’s impossible between us! Can you please stop pestering me?” ”

Ye Sen’s face darkened. “You misunderstood.”

“”I misunderstood?”Li Yiyi snorted, “If I misunderstood, can you follow me here? You’re a man, why don’t you have any dignity? You’re so thick-skinned! No wonder you can only be a poor person for the rest of your life!” ”

“Ye Sen was not made of mud, but now in the coffee shop, he had to pay attention to his image. He could not lose his gentlemanly demeanor and shout loudly at a shrew. ”

“”Li Yiyi, listen well! I’m not here for you! You’re not some fairy from the nine heavens. You’re not worth me thinking about until now!” ”

“Tch!”Li Yiyi’s face was full of disdain. “Stop pretending! Don’t think that I don’t know what you’re thinking!”

Ye Sen had loved her so much before. How could he forget her so easily?

“So, Ye Sen’s current state was definitely an Act! ”

“Li Yiyi’s heart was filled with a sense of superiority. “I’m warning you one last time. Don’t follow me anymore. Otherwise, my boyfriend won’t let you off!” ”

“At this moment, Ye Sen saw the person-in-charge of the other company walk in from the door. He couldn’t be bothered with Li Yiyi anymore. He immediately stood up and greeted her, “CEO Qian.” ”

“”CEO Ye, Nice to meet you.” ”

“Ye Sen continued, “It’s not convenient to talk about the cooperation in the hall. Let’s go to the private room. Waiter, do you have a private room here?” ”

“”Yes, we do. Gentlemen, please follow me.” ”

The two of them followed the waiter to the private room.

Li Yiyi was left standing on the spot with a look of surprise.

What was going on?

“If she didn’t hear wrongly, the man just now was called Ye Senye? ”

Could it be that Ye Sen had become rich?

“Li Yiyi swallowed her throat and then remembered that the suit ye Sen was wearing was also a brand. It couldn’t be bought without 18,000 yuan. ”

Wang Chenglei also had a suit that looked exactly the same. He usually treasured it so much that he couldn’t bear to wear it!

Li Yiyi didn’t know how she walked back to her seat.

“”Baby, you’re here.”Wang Chenglei didn’t see the scene just now. He reached out and hugged Li Yiyi’s waist. ” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Looking at Wang Chenglei’s fat hands and thinking of Ye Sen who was wearing a suit just now, Li Yiyi suddenly felt nauseous. ”

“She left ye Sen because Ye Sen was too poor. Now That Ye Sen was President Ye, of course she had to go back to Ye Sen’s side! ”
