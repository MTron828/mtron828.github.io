“”No?”Grandma Fei frowned, “But why do I feel that you are so familiar...” ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Grandma Fei, you must be mistaken. This is the first time that Cen Shaoqing has come to our Chang Yue country.” ”

“First time?”Grandma Fei asked in surprise.

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Grandma Fei smiled and said, “Then I must have seen wrongly. Take a seat, I’ll go get you some water.” ”

“”Please take a seat.”Ye Zhuo pressed Grandma Fei to sit down and continued, “I’ll go get some water.” ”

Cen Shaoqing stood up. “I’ll go with you.”

Grandma Fei looked at the two of them as they went to get some water. Her eyes were filled with relief.

The two of them looked so compatible even from the back.

Ye Zhuo was very familiar with Grandma Fei’s home. He used the flower tea he brought over to make a cup of tea for Grandma Cen.

“Then, he poured two cups of boiled water. ”

“Soon, the water was ready. ”

“Ye Zhuo handed the cup to Grandma Fei. “Grandma Fei, this is the flower tea i brought back from Earth. Try It and see how it tastes.” ”

“”I brought it back from Earth. It must be very delicious.”Grandma Fei smiled. “I heard from my great-grandmother that Earth is a very good place! Unfortunately, these people don’t know how to cherish it. They think they are superior, but they are actually the most pitiful ones.” ”

“After saying that, Grandma Fei took a sip of the flower tea and looked up at Ye Zao. “The taste is really good! Zao Zao, who made this?” ”

“”My mom made it,”ye Zao said. ”

“Grandma Fei continued, “Really? You Said You wanted to show me pictures of your family last time. Did you bring them today?” ”

“”I did.”Ye Zao nodded slightly and took out his phone. He used the shadow technique to open the pictures and introduced them to Grandma Fei one by one, “Grandma Fei, this is my mom, this is my dad, and this is my uncle. This is my grandma, this is grandma... And this, this is my uncle, aunt... fourth uncle, fourth aunt...” ”

“There were many relatives in the Lin family, and Grandma Fei did not find it troublesome. She recognized each and every one of them, and the smile on her face never disappeared. ” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“”Good, this is really good.”Grandma Fei was really happy for ye Zao. After so many years, this child had finally found a family that belonged to her. “Zao Zao, they must love you very much, right?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

Ye Zao also felt very lucky more than once.

“Although she was abandoned since she was young, she still met those family members who were filled with her. ”

“”Seeing you like this, I am relieved. I can also leave in peace in the future.”Grandma Fei patted ye Zao’s hand. “When I go underground, I will definitely tell your grandma this good news and let her be at ease.” ”

“”Grandma Fei, you’ll definitely live a long life,”ye Zao said. ”

“”Silly child. People will face death when they grow old. This is the law of nature.”Grandma Fei smiled and said, “Do you think your Grandma Fei is the kind of person who is afraid of Death?” ”

“She was not afraid of death, so naturally, she was not afraid of life, old age, illness, and death. ”

“In fact, sometimes, she actually looked forward to death. This way, she could reunite with her relatives who had been away for a long time. ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Grandma Fei, since you like Earth so much, you should come back with us this time. I will take care of you on Earth, taking care of you until you die!” ”

“”No need.”Grandma Fei shook her head, “Zhuo Zhuo, grandma is really happy that you have such intentions.”. “But when one is old, they are most afraid of suffering. Although this place is not as good as I imagined, it is also the place where I was born and raised. I am afraid that if I die on Earth, what if your grandma and the others come to pick me up and can’t find me?” ”

“No matter what time it was, people had a special feeling towards their homeland, especially the elderly. ”

“”Then I’ll take you to Earth to play for a few days, and then I’ll send you back. What do you think?”Ye Zhuo continued to ask. ”

Granny Fei still refused.

“As one gets older, the thing one fears the most is trouble. ”

“After staying at Granny Fei’s place for the whole afternoon, Ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing made Granny Fei Lunch on Earth together. ”

“Grandma Fei was very happy. When the two of them left, Grandma Fei held their hands and said, “Zhuozhuo, Little Cen, you must be well.” ”

Ye Zhuo nodded.

“Cen Shaoqing looked at Grandma Fei and said, “Grandma Fei, don’t worry. I will take good care of Zhuozhuo. If I go back on my words, the heavens will strike.” ”

“Grandma Fei nodded, “Luoluo suffered a lot when she was young. I only hope that she will be fine and happy every day in the future. Little Cen, remember what you said today. Otherwise, even if I die, I will not let you off even if I become a ghost.” ”
