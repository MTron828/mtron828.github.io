“The corners of Jamila’s mouth twitched, then she said, “Don’t worry, Miss Gu. We will take your family over and let your younger brothers and sisters attend the best schools in China. As for your parents, as long as they are willing, we will give them the most decent jobs. If they’re not willing, then they can live a good life at home. As for food, clothing, and transportation, they don’t have to worry about it, much less you, Miss Gu.” ”

Could China give gu si everything that he had given her?

Gu Si was a nobody in China.

“A family of five lived in a crowded two-bedroom living room. They couldn’t even solve the simple housing problem, let alone the servants. ”

It was obvious what Gu Si would choose.

Gu Si nodded. “What about nationality?”

“Jamila smiled. “Please rest assured, Miss Gu. We will arrange for your entire family to have C nationality, and it will be a high-class surname.” ”

C country was a country with a distinct class system.

“It was divided into high-class, middle-class, and equivalent surnames. ”

“Under normal circumstances, Chinese immigrants would be discriminated against if they did not have a high-class surname in C country, but it was different if they had a high-class surname. ”

“With a high-class family name, they would be highly respected no matter where they went. ”

“This was the reason why many people not only immigrated to country C, but also changed their names! ”

“In front of this monstrous power, what was the big deal about changing their family name? ”

Gu Si looked up at Jamila. “Then what family name does Mr. Jamila intend to give me?”

“”Davis,”Jamila said. ”

“Davis was the tenth most common surname in C nation. Although it was not ranked first among the top ten most common surnames, it was still not bad to be ranked tenth. After all, this was a surname that even a daughter could not exchange for. ”

“”You mean, I will be called Gu Si Davis from now on?” ”

“Yes.”Jamila nodded. The sarcasm in her eyes became more and more obvious.

“Although Jamila had met many people who changed their surnames for the sake of power, it was the first time she had met someone like Gu si. ”

Many people would pretend to feel uncomfortable for a while when they talked about changing their surnames.

But what about Gu Si?

“He didn’t even frown, let alone feel uncomfortable. ”

It seemed that his judgment wasn’t wrong.

“Like master, like disciple. ”

“Gu Si maintained her smile and continued, “By the way, did Mr. Jamila ask Liu Yuan?” ”

“Jamila stopped smiling. “Miss Gu, I’ve already told you that Liu Yuan is not worthy of me doing this for her!” ”

“Are you not worthy or do you not dare?”Gu Si looked at Jamila.

“Jamila did not reject Gu Si’s words. She took out a pen and handed it to Gu si. “Miss Gu, if you don’t think it’s a problem, just sign it.” ”

Gu Si took the pen and lowered her head to sign the document.

“Looking at Gu Si who was writing with her head lowered, the corners of Jamila’s mouth curled up into a proud smile. ”

“Although she had hit a wall with Feng Qi’s mother, it was much easier for Gu si than he had imagined. ”

“After a few seconds, Gu si signed the document and handed it to Jamila. ”

“Jamila took the document with a smile. “Miss gu is more reasonable than I thought. If everyone in China was like Miss Gu...”she had barely finished her sentence when.., the rest of the sentence was stuck in her mouth. She couldn’t say anything. In an instant, Jamila’s face turned very ugly. ”

“Gu Si didn’t sign her name on the signature page at all. Instead, she signed four words in a straight line: ”

Despicable and Shameless!

“Fortunately, Jamila had studied Chinese before and was quite good at it. ”

“Otherwise, she would have been fooled by Gu si today! ”

“Jamila looked up at Gu si. “Miss Gu, what do you mean by this?” ”

“However, Gu si still had a smile on her face. “What’s wrong, Mr. Jamila? Is Something Wrong?” ”

“”Is this your signature?”Jamila handed the document over and pointed at the signature, her face full of anger. ” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“”You mean this? This is an adjective and an idiom.”Gu si continued, “It’s used to be of poor quality, regardless of shame. It’s a derogatory term.” ”

“”I know what it means!”Jamila continued, “I want to know what miss gu means now!” ”

Gu Si drank a mouthful of lemonade. “It means it literally! Don’t you think that this sentence is very appropriate to describe your country?”

“Jamila held back the anger in her heart and forced out a smile. “Miss Gu, don’t joke around.” ”

“”I’m joking! Who’s joking around with you!”Gu si continued, “Does Mr. Jamila think that this word is inappropriate?” ”
