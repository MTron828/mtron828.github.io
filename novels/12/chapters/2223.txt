“Yes.”Ye Han nodded.

“Shi Qingcheng continued, “Did Zhuozhu tell you everything?” ”

“Ye Han nodded again, his face slightly red, and his heart beating a little fast. ”

“”I asked you to reply the next day, why did you wait until now?”Shi Qingcheng continued, “If your sister didn’t ask you, you wouldn’t remember this matter?” ”

“Ye Han explained, “Didn’t I just happen to come across the matter of man Wen? I wanted to reply you later, but who knew that things would go on one after another...” ”

“Shi Qingcheng immediately raised her hand to stop ye Han from finishing his sentence. “Stop, stop, I’m not here to listen to your nonsense. I want to know your answer. As long as it’s okay, if it’s not okay, I should go back!” ”

“She had been out for so many days, and her family was already urging her to go back. ”

“Ye Han’s heart was beating faster and faster. He took a deep breath and looked at Shi Qingcheng. “Sister Qingcheng, I... I...” ”

Shi Qingcheng patiently waited for Ye Han’s answer.

“At times like this, the more nervous she was, the more she stuttered. The words that were on the tip of her tongue were harder to say. Ye Han had never felt so embarrassed before. ”

“Ye Han tried his best to calm himself down. He looked at Shi Qingcheng and said, “I, let’s Be Together!” ”

“After saying that, Ye Han felt much more relaxed in his heart. Even his breathing became smoother. ”

A beautiful flower instantly bloomed at the corner of Shi Qingcheng’s mouth. “Have you thought it through?”

“Yes.”Ye Han nodded.

“You don’t mind that I’m older than you?”Shi Qingcheng continued to ask.

“I don’t mind.”Ye Han’s words became more and more crisp. “A third-year girl hugging a golden brick.” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Shi Qingcheng smiled and said, “Then what do you call me now?” ”

“Sister Qingcheng.”

Shi Qingcheng crossed her arms in front of her chest. “I’ll give you another chance.”

Ye Han was stunned.

“If he didn’t call her sister Qingcheng, what should he call her? ”

“Because Shi Qingcheng was older than him and Shi Qingcheng was good friends with Ye Zhuo, ye Han kept calling her sister Qingcheng. ”

“Seeing ye Han’s silly look, Shi Qingcheng was a little speechless and said, “Ye Xiaohan, are you stupid? which couple calls each other brother and sister?” ”

He was really not enlightened.

No wonder he was still single at such an old age!

She was also blind to have taken a liking to Ye Han.

“Ye Han also reacted in an instant. He subconsciously pulled Shi Qingcheng into his embrace and held her tightly. “Qingcheng, Shi Qingcheng.” ”

“His voice was very faint, but every word hit Shi Qingcheng’s heart. ”

“One moment, then another. ”

It made her feel hot and dry.

“Shi Qingcheng’s face instantly turned red. Her hands wrapped tightly around ye Han’s waist. “Ye Xiaohan, you’ve finally understood.” ”

“Ye Zhuo stood not far away from the two of them. When he saw the two of them hugging each other, the corners of his mouth curled up into an old mother’s kind smile. ”

She was three years older than ye Han.

“However, when she brought ye Han back, Ye Han was only thirteen years old. ”

“Boys were late to learn, but the thirteen-year-old ye Han was much more mature than his peers. In the blink of an eye, the child from back then had grown up so much. ”

“In a moment, ye Zhuo turned around slightly and walked to the other side. ”

She came to Cen Shaoqing’s office.

“You’re back.”Cen Shaoqing put down the Buddha beads and looked up at Ye Zhuo.

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Something very happy happened. I want to share it with you.”

“Cen Shaoqing reached out and grabbed her wrist, pulling it gently. ”

“After a moment of dizziness, ye Zao was pulled into his arms. ”

“What Happy Thing?”Cen Shaoqing played with her hand and said in a low voice.

“Her hands were very beautiful. Her fingers were as delicate as jade and as exquisite as sculptures. rows of crystal-clear fingernails were like beautiful little shells, white and pink, like an exquisite work of art. ”

“”Ye Han and Qingcheng are together,”ye Zao said. ”

“Really?”Cen Shaoqing was also a little surprised.

“In a moment, he remembered the question that ye Han had asked him alone. ”

So there was a reason for everything.

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded. “I really didn’t expect that Qingcheng would one day be together with Ye Han.”

“They are a good match.”Cen Shaoqing’s attention was completely not on Ye Han and Shi Qingcheng.

“If he could still be distracted by other people’s matters, how could he still be a man? ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “They are indeed a good match.” ”

“After saying that, ye Zao continued, “Right now, only my brother and Lizi are still single.” ”

“OH.”Cen Shaoqing said.

“Can you not move around!”Ye Zao slapped Cen Shaoqing’s hand away.

“Cen Shaoqing immediately put his hand back and continued, “Don’t you still have a friend?” ”

“Do you mean Yueyue or Pingting?”Ye Zhuo asked.
