“It’s true.”Mother Zhao nodded.

“Lan Yueyin continued, “Our four girls are really smart! Actually, our little treasure also did well and got 410 points! This shows that our children are all smart.” ”

“Mother Zhao was naturally unhappy that her daughter, whom she had raised for nineteen years, was called their four girls by an outsider. ”

But now was not the time to fuss over that.

“Mother Zhao forced a dry smile on her face, then, she said, “Big Sister Lan, Pingting has been having some health problems recently and is still in the hospital. I hope that you and Big Brother Wang can find the time to visit the child and explain to the child what happened back then.” ”

“Wang da Cai said in surprise, “The four little girls are sick? Is It Serious?” ”

Mother Zhao sighed. “You’ll know when you go and take a look.”

“Wang Dazai immediately stood up and said, ”

“”There’s no time to lose. Let’s Go Now!”It was said that when people were sick, it was the time when they needed their family’s care the most. ”

“Now that Zhao Pingting was sick, they could take this opportunity to get Zhao Pingting to accept her. ”

“Now?”Mother Zhao and father Zhao were stunned.

They never thought that Lan Yueyin and Wang dacai would care so much about Zhao Pingting.

“”Okay, let’s do it now.”Mother Zhao nodded. ”

They did not delay and immediately went to the hospital.

Zhao Pingting was staying in the oncology department on the sixth floor.

“As soon as they reached the ward, Lan Yueyin stopped and held Wang Dacai’s hand. “Don’t go in yet! Wait!” ”

“”Big Sister Lan, What’s Wrong?”Mother Zhao was about to open the door when she turned around in confusion. ”

“Lan Yueyin looked up at the ward’s door sign. “Oncology Department? Tell me honestly, aunt, what illness did our wretched girl get?” ”

Lan Yueyin’s family had relatives who had died of cancer.

“If she remembered correctly, she had gone to the oncology department when she visited the hospital. ”

Mother Zhao sighed and did not say anything.

“Father Zhao’s eyes were red as he said, “Lung cancer, middle or late stage.” ”

“”What?”Lan Yueyin’s eyes widened as she looked at the Zhao couple, “I was wondering why you suddenly brought us to the hospital! So you had other ideas! How could there be such shameless people like you in this world! Your own daughter is dying of cancer, and you still want us to pay for Your Daughter’s treatment? “Why do you think so?” ”

Did you really think that Lan Yueyin was easy to bully?

No Way!

“”Big Sister Lan! What are you talking about!”Mother Zhao looked at Lan Yueyin in disbelief. “Even though we have cancer, we never thought of asking your family to pay a single cent!” ”

“Lan Yueyin snorted. “You say it nicely. If you don’t want our family to pay, why did you call us here? Don’t think that I don’t know what you are planning! Bah!” ”

“Father Zhao tried his best to suppress the anger in his body. “Pingting is your biological child! Ask yourself, are you speaking the human language?” ”

Lan Yueyin was not a fool.

“Since she already had cancer, she had no value to be used. Of course, she had to immediately distance herself from the relationship. ”

“”We don’t have such biological child! Since her surname is Zhao now, she has to be under the Zhao family’s control! She has nothing to do with us! Don’t even think about involving us in this! Come, Old Wang, let’s go home!” ”

“Let’s Go!”Wang da Cai was also very angry!

He originally thought that he could enjoy his daughter’s happiness in the future.

He didn’t expect this wretched girl to be a short-lived ghost!

What Bad Luck!

“”Don’t go!”Father Zhao grabbed Wang Dacai’s hand and said with a sobbing voice, “Brother Dacai, I beg you not to go. The child really needs you now!” ”

Father Zhao did not want to give Zhao Pingting Hope and disappoint her again.

Cancer patients were most afraid of having ups and downs.

“At this moment, the door of the ward was pulled open from the inside. ”

Zhao Pingting walked out of the room in her hospital gown. “Dad! Let Them Go! Only you and mom are my biological parents. I don’t know them! Tell them to get lost!”

“Pingting?”Father Zhao turned to look at Zhao Pingting.

“”Let me go! What does your daughter’s life and death have to do with us?”Wang Dacai took the opportunity to shake off Father Zhao’s hand and ran far away with Lan Yueyin, afraid that the Zhao family would pester them in the next second. ”

“Zhao pingting cried, “Father and mother! Didn’t I tell you not to look for them? I’m your daughter! I’m your daughter! It has nothing to do with them!” ”
