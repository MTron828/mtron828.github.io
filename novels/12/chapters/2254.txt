Translator: 549690339

Bai Jingshu had always trusted Chen Yaosheng.

She had never thought that Chen Yaosheng would do such a thing.

“Although she was not the one who stole the book, standing in front of Lin Ze still made her feel embarrassed, embarrassed, and embarrassed. She wanted to find a hole to crawl into. The book in her hand seemed to weigh thousands of pounds, and her feelings were especially complicated. ”

“”Mr. Lin, I’m sorry. I know it’s useless to say anything now, but I really didn’t know that you were the original owner of this book. If I knew, I would have sent it to you immediately!”Bai Jingshu bowed to Lin Ze. ”

It was the first time Bai Jingshu had experienced such an embarrassing thing in her life.

“Lin Ze took the book and said calmly, “Miss Bai, you don’t have to be like this. We’ve known each other for a long time. I know who you are. With your upbringing, you would never allow yourself to do such a thing.” ”

“If Bai Jingshu had really stolen the Yuan dynasty records, she definitely wouldn’t take it out and read it openly. ”

“Moreover, Bai Jingshu was definitely not that kind of person. ”

“”Mr. Lin, thank you for your understanding.”Bai Jingshu looked at Lin Ze. ”

“Although this matter had nothing to do with her, if it was someone else, they might not be as calm as Lin Ze. ”

The Yuan dynasty records was the only copy. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“There was also such a copy on Earth, so Lin ze must be very anxious these days. ”

“But at this moment, other than saying thank you for Lin Ze’s understanding, Bai Jingshu could not find any other words to say. ”

“”You’re welcome,”Lin ze continued, “However, you have to be careful when making friends. It’s best that you don’t contact that friend of yours again in the future.” ”

“In the long run, Bai Jingshu would definitely be at a disadvantage. ”

“”Yes, I know.”Bai Jingshu nodded. “Don’t worry, I’ll immediately cut ties with him.” ”

“”Okay.”Lin Ze took the book. “Since I’ve found the book, I’ll go back first. Oh, right, if you need help, you can contact me.” ”

“Bai Jingshu was from the s galaxy, so she probably didn’t have many friends on Earth. ”

“Chen Yaosheng wasn’t an ordinary person to begin with. If there was an argument, Bai Jingshu couldn’t possibly be Chen Yaosheng’s match. ”

“Thinking of this, Lin Ze continued, “Miss Bai, if you don’t mind, let’s add each other’s contact details.” ”

“Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded and exchanged contact details with Lin Ze.

“”If there’s anything, contact me anytime. I’ll be leaving first.”Lin Ze turned around and left. ”

“”Take care, Mr. Lin.”Bai Jingshu watched Lin ze leave. ”

This was the second time Bai Jingshu had seen Lin Ze.

“Compared to the first time, she had to understand him more thoroughly this time. ”

“Lin Ze looked cold, but he actually had a warm heart. ”

“If not, he would have done things differently today. ”

“Lin Ze did not go back directly. Instead, he went to the library. ”

“When Xia Shang saw Lin Ze, he immediately felt a headache coming. He hurriedly went out to welcome him. “Mr. Lin Is Here!” ”

“”President Xia,”Lin ze nodded and continued, “I came to look for you today because of the matter of the Yuan dynasty records...” ”

“Before he could finish his sentence, Xia Shang immediately said, “Mr. Lin, don’t worry. We are actively cooperating with the police department to try our best to find the book back!” ”

“If they really couldn’t get it back, they could only go and pay for it. ”

“”There’s no need to pay for it,”Lin ze said. ”

“Just go and pay for it?”Xia Shang was already calculating how much money he would need to settle this matter.

“At least two houses, right? ”

And they had to be within the third ring road.

Xia Shang’s heart was bleeding.

“Seeing Xia Shang like this, Lin ze chuckled and said, “President Xia, you misunderstood. I’ve already found the book.” ”

“Hearing this, Xia Shang thought he was hearing things. ”

The book was found? ? ?

So Fast!

“”No, Mr. Lin.”Xia Shang gulped. “What did you just say? Can you repeat it again? What did you find?” ”

“”I’ve already found the book.”Lin Ze continued, “President Xia, you can go to the police station to close the case.” ”

“Really?”Xia Shang asked in disbelief.

“Yes.”Lin Ze nodded.

“”Mr. Lin, I don’t dare to joke about this. Have you really found the book?”Xia Shang confirmed again, his face full of disbelief. ”

“”It’s true. I’m not joking,”Lin ze said. ”

“Xia Shang continued, “Then, where did you find it, Mr. Lin? Who stole the Yuan Dynasty Records?” ”

Xia Shang was really too curious!

What kind of person could steal the Yuan dynasty records right under his nose? Even the more than 300 surveillance cameras did not manage to capture any powerful images.
