Chapter 48: Severing Ties

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

On top of being a single woman, Ye Shu to take care of her good-for-nothing daughter and gambling addict brother. She had no one else to rely on. Under such circumstances, she would definitely come back and beg them.

Therefore, Ye Shuai was not worried at all. He said, “Mom, just wait and see. I’ll count to seven. She’ll definitely come back for us.”

As he spoke, Ye Shuai started counting down.

However, after the counting to seven, Ye Shu still did not turn back. It seemed that she had no such intention.

Ye Shuang frowned. She could not let Ye Shu single-handedly disrupt Lin Haifu’s plan. She had to think of a way to resolve this! She quickly picked up her phone and sent a message.

Just as Ye Shu opened the door of the study, she bumped into Li Hongwei.

Li Hongwei was big and burly. Ye Shu subconsciously took a few steps back.

“Little Shu.” Li Hongwei stared at Ye Shu with lecherous eyes. His gazed was fixated on Ye Shu as if she were naked.

Ye Shuang smiled and walked over. “Little Shu, we’ll leave you and Mr. Li alone here. Take your time and have a little chat.”

With that, Ye Shuang led everyone out of the study.

“Big Sister!” Ye Shu knew that something was wrong, so she grabbed Ye Shuang’s hand.

Ye Shuang swiftly passed Ye Shu’s hand over to Li Hongwei. “Mr. Li, please take good care of my fourth sister.”

In Ye Shuang’s eyes, Ye Shu was just pretending to be serious. Since Ye Shu was too embarrassed to admit it, she would help Ye Shu. She would let ‘it’ happen to Ye Shu and Li Hongwei.

“Don’t worry! Don’t worry!” Li Hongwei grabbed Ye Shu’s hand. “Little Shu, don’t worry. I’m a kind-hearted person. Let’s go in and get to know each other better.”

Li Hongwei was really satisfied with Ye Shu. She was beautiful and had a good figure. She was more beautiful than any of his previous mistresses.

Since the Lin family and the Ye family had agreed to this matter, he didn’t have to endure any longer. He couldn’t wait any longer.

Ye Shuang didn’t give Ye Shu the chance to refuse at all. She directly closed the door behind her.

“Little Shu...” Li Hongwei once again stretched out his perverted hand toward Ye Shu.

“Let go of me!” Ye Shu batted Li Hongwei’s hand away and hid at a corner.

Li Hongwei’s eyes flashed with a wretched light. He rubbed his hands and said, “Such a wild temper? But I like it!”

...

Outside.

Seeing everyone but her mother walking out of the study room, Ye Zhuo sensed something strange was going on. “Where’s my mother?” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

‘She’s such a wild child, rude and impudent!’

Ye Shuang frowned. “Who are you talking to? Didn’t your mother teach you how to properly address your elders? You have no manners at all!”

A joyous laugh could be heard from the side. “Mother, look at what you’re saying. If she had manners, my fourth aunt wouldn’t have given birth to her out of wedlock.” These words were insinuating that Ye Shu was a bad person.

The person who spoke was Lin Xue.

In Lin Xue’s eyes, Ye Shu and Ye Zhuo were two poor and pitiful people, so she wasn’t afraid of offending Ye Zhuo.

“Lin Xue!” Ye Sen said with a face full of anger, “Watch your attitude!”

Lin Xuan walked down the stairs and stood in front of Ye Sen. She then said in a manner that was neither haughty nor humble, “I respect you, that’s why I address you as my uncle. This is Lin family residence. If you don’t like our words and deeds, the main door is over there.”

Lin Xuan had long disliked this group of poor relatives.

Hearing this, Ye Sen was so angry that his entire body trembled with rage. It was also at this moment that he realized how important money was. Without money, even a junior could trample his dignity on the ground.

Ye Zhuo did not have the time to argue with them. She went straight to the door of the study and knocked on the door. “Mom! Mom, are you inside?”

There was no response from inside.

Like Ye Zhuo, Ye Sen also realized that something was amiss. He quickly followed behind Ye Zhuo and knocked on the door. “Sister! Sister!”

Ye Shuang walked over with a smile and grabbed Ye Zhuo’s arm. “Your mom is talking to Mr. Li inside! Why are you meddling in her affairs? Hurry up and leave!”

“Get lost!” Ye Zhuo shrugged Ye Shuang away.

Ye Shuang did not expect Ye Zhuo to have such great strength that she was instantly thrown off balance and fell to the ground.

Seeing Ye Shuang being thrown to the ground, all hell broke loose.

Ye Zhuo kept yelling for her mother while the others fussed over their Big Sister who was on the floor. They even threw curses at Ye Zhuo for disrespecting her eldest aunt.

Ye Dafu rushed forward to help Ye Shuang up from the ground. “Dad, I’m fine. Let her make a scene! I want to see what tricks she can pull!”

The door of the study was bulletproof. Not only was the sound insulation very good, it was also very sturdily built.

Not to mention one Ye Zhuo, even if ten Ye Zhuos came, as long as the people inside did not open the door, the door would not open at all.

At this moment...

Bang!

The extremely loud sound stunned everyone. One could even feel the entire ground shaking along with it.

No one had expected that Ye Zhuo would actually kick the door open, just like that.

“Zhuo Zhuo!”

Seeing the door open, Ye Shu, who was inside, immediately ran over.

“Mom.” Ye Zhuo shielded Ye Shu behind her.

Ye Shu’s hair was in a mess, her clothes were torn, and there was a scratch on her neck. She looked very pathetic.

Li Hongwei chased after her from behind.

Anyone with a discerning eye could tell what was going on at a glance.

“B*stard! B*stard! How dare you bully my sister!” Ye Sen rushed in with red eyes, wanting to beat up Li Hongwei.

However, Ye Sen, who was as thin as a bolt of lightning, was no match for Li Hongwei. Not only did he not manage to hit Li Hongwei, but he was lifted up by Li Hongwei with one hand.

Li Hongwei lifted Ye Sen with one hand and looked at Ye Shuang angrily. “Mrs. Lin! How do you explain this!”

He was about to finally get some! Right at this critical moment, he was forcefully interrupted by someone. Could one expect him to be happy about it?

Ye Zhuo stood there with her hands clenched into fists. She took off her UV protection jacket and draped it over Ye Shu. “Mom, give me a moment.”

At this moment, Ye Shu was stunned. She had never seen Ye Zhuo act like this. Cold air was emanating from her body.

Before anyone could react, another loud sound was heard, followed by a painful howl.

“Stop hitting me! Stop hitting!”

By the time everyone came to their senses and had a good look, Lin Hongwei was already beaten up onto the ground by Ye Zhuo.

His fat head had now swelled up as big as a pig’s head.

Ye Zhuo just stood there, crushing Li Hongwei’s fingers under her feet. “Who gave you the guts to do this? How dare you bully my mother?”

There was a saying that all ten fingers were connected to the heart, and currently, Lin Hongwei’s facial features twisted from the excruciating pain. He wailed, “I don’t dare! I really don’t dare...”

“And you guys!” Ye Zhuo turned her gaze to her relatives. Her eyes were ruthless like never seen before. “Who gave you the right to bully my mother?”

Everyone was very quiet.

No one made a single sound.

No one expected that a trash like her would have such skills. Not only did she knock down the door, but she also gave Li Hongwei a beating.

All of this happened too quickly.

Ye Shu’s eyes were red. She tugged at the corner of Ye Zhuo’s shirt. “Zhuo Zhuo, let’s go back quickly!”

She could not bear to stay here for another second!

Only then did Ye Zhuo release Li Hongwei.

Ye Sen quickly followed the behind his sister and niece.

It was also at this moment that everyone finally reacted and rushed forward to help Li Hongwei up from the ground.

Ye Shuang was so angry that she was about to explode. She ran over to block the three from exiting the house, all the while shouted angrily, “Ye Shu, stop right there! Hurry up and make that uncultured daughter of yours apologize to Mr. Li!”

‘That b*tch Ye Zhuo is really too bold! How dare she hit Li Hongwei.’

“Apologize?” Ye Shu looked at her eldest sister as if she were looking at a stranger. “Ye Shuang! Are you still human? I’m your biological sister!”

“Shut up! I don’t have such an embarrassing sister like you! If you don’t think of a way to make Mr. Li forgive you today, we’ll sever our ties from now on! I’m will not acknowledge you as my sister anymore, ”

Sever ties?

Would Ye Shu dare to sever ties with her family?
