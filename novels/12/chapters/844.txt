“Chapter 845: 185: I’ll break your leg. If my granddaughter-in-law isn’t good, who is? 3”

Translator: 549690339

Cen Yuyan knew Zhou Xiang the best.

“Zhou Xiang was a soft-hearted person. As long as she begged Zhou Xiang, Zhou Xiang would definitely agree. ”

“”Fourth brother, it’s indeed inappropriate for Chenyu to move into our house. Your grandmother’s disapproval is also reasonable. Shaoqing is on a business trip now. If Shaoqing doesn’t come back from a business trip, he will definitely go back home to live. When that time comes, it will definitely not be suitable for Chenyu to live here too!” ”

“Zhou Xiang paused at this point and continued, “Moreover, Chenyu is a big star. What do you think will happen if the paparazzi catches her staying in our house?” ”

“Although Zhou Xiang did not usually talk much and did not like to meddle in family matters, she was a big-picture person and considered everything very thoroughly. ”

Cen Shaoqing and song Chenyu were unmarried and unmarried.

“If song Chenyu really lived in the Cen family, even if nothing happened between the two of them, some things would still be spread. ”

The entertainment industry was the most chaotic.

How would it be spread?

“Of course, it would be spread as Cen Yuyan wanted it to be spread. ”

“Cen Yuyan wanted the paparazzi to capture song Chenyu living in the Cen family. This way, the media would definitely publicize it. At that time, Song Chenyu would become the CEN family’s mistress. ”

“However, she didn’t expect that not only old Madam Cen didn’t agree, even Zhou Xiang didn’t agree! ”

“”Mom, you’ve changed.”Cen Yuyan looked at Zhou Xiang. ”

“How have I changed?”Zhou Xiang asked in confusion.

“CEN Yuyan continued, “You weren’t like this in the past. Chenyu has no relatives in the capital. Her only friend is me. If I don’t help her, how can I be considered a friend? “If this were in the past, you would definitely welcome Chenyu to stay at our house!” ”

“Zhou Xiang frowned slightly. “The past is the past, and now is the present. You have to know that Shaoqing already has a girlfriend. If he were to spread news about this with a female celebrity, what would it look like?” ” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Cen Yuyan felt very uncomfortable when she heard this.

“In the end, it was all because of ye Zao! ”

“If it wasn’t for Ye Zao, Song Chenyu would definitely have been able to move into the Cen family. ”

“Cen Yuyan raised her head and looked at Zhou Xiang. “So what if she’s a female celebrity? Mom, are you looking down on female celebrities?” ”

“Zhou Xiang was a person with a very good temper. She was not angry when Cen Yuyan spoke to her like this. Instead, there was a smile on her face, “I’m not looking down on female celebrities. I just feel that female celebrities live under the camera. If she really moves into our house, she will definitely be photographed by the paparazzi! “This is not good. Anyway, fourth brother, don’t think about this anymore. Your grandmother and I will not agree to it.” ”

Cen Yuyan thought that she could convince Zhou Xiang.

She did not expect Zhou Xiang to be assimilated by Old Madam Cen.

“”Mom,”Cen Yuyan softened her tone and began to act coquettishly. “Mom, I’m begging you...” ”

“It’s useless even if you beg me.”

“Cen Yuyan continued, “Mom, Chenyu is my best friend... During my most difficult time, she helped me. I also want to help her during her most difficult time.” ”

Zhou Xiang did not say anything.

“Cen Yuyan said again, “Mom...” ”

“Zhou Xiang suddenly stood up from the chair. “It’s time to apply the facial mask. Fourth brother, I’m not going to talk nonsense with you anymore. I’m going to apply the facial mask.” ”

Apply the facial mask?

Cen Yuyan’s expression darkened.

“Could it be that in Zhou Xiang’s eyes, song Chenyu’s safety was not as important as applying the facial mask? ”

It had changed!

It had changed!

They had all changed!

They had become so unfamiliar.

“Ye Zhuo had not married into the Cen family yet, and they had already become like this. If ye Zhuo married into the Cen family, would the Cen family still be able to live in peace? ”

No.

Ye Zhuo must not be allowed to marry into the Cen family.

No!

“Looking at Zhou Xiang’s back as he went upstairs, Cen Yuyan narrowed her eyes. ”

“In a moment, CEN Yuyan also left the CEN family and went to song Chenyu’s hotel. ”

“Because his place of residence had been discovered by the illegitimate rice, song Chenyu could only stay in the hotel now. ”

Cen Yuyan stood in front of the hotel room door and knocked.

“When song Chenyu opened the door, he realized that it was Cen Yuyan. He said in surprise, “Yuyan, why are you here so late?” ”

“I’m in a bad mood and wanted to chat with you.”Cen Yuyan lowered her head in dejection.

“What’s going on?”Song Chenyu held Cen Yuyan’s hand. “Come in quickly.”

Cen Yuyan followed song Chenyu into the house.

“Song Chenyu closed the door and pulled Cen Yuyan to the sofa in the living room to sit down. “Yuyan, what’s Going On?” ”

“Cen Yuyan sighed and held song Chenyu’s hand tightly. “Chenyu, I’m sorry...” ”

Song Chenyu was baffled. “What’s wrong? How did you let me down?”

“Cen Yuyan did not directly answer song Chenyu’s question. She continued, “By the way, have you solved the problem of the illegitimate rice?” ”
