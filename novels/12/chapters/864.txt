“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “There’s no need. You can go out. I’ll do it here.” ”

“Lu Qi didn’t know how to cook, so when she heard this, she smiled and said, “Okay, then you cook. After dinner, Xuancheng and I will be responsible for washing the dishes.” ”

“Okay.”Song Chenyu nodded.

On team Red’s side.

“It was too hot to eat in the house at night, so Wei Xingzhi moved the table outside and the few of them ate in the courtyard. ”

“Although it was quite hot in the day, it was very cool and breezy outside at night. The few of them sat in the courtyard, which was more comfortable than sitting in an air-conditioned house. ”

There were four dishes and one soup in the evening.

One braised fish. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Then boiled meat slices, white cabbage with black fungus milk, and then mapo tofu ordered by Wei xingzhi. ”

There was also a tomato and egg soup.

“Wei Xingzhi poured four cups of beer, raised the cup and stood up. “Wei Wei, Chang Yu, tonight’s meal is made by Yezi. Yezi worked so hard during the day. Let’s drink to Yezi.” ”

Yin Wei and Chang Yu immediately stood up.

“Before today, perhaps Chang Yu still had a deep opinion of ye Zao. ”

“But after today, Chang Yu could only acknowledge ye Zao with respect! ”

This person had no choice but to acknowledge him!

She was really too amazing.

“Ye Zao also hurriedly held the glass and stood up. “Thank you, teacher Wei. Wei Wei, Chang Yu. Actually, I’m not the only one who has worked hard. You guys have also worked hard. This glass of wine is for all of us.” ”

The few of them downed the wine in their cups in one gulp and then began to sit down to eat.

Chang Yu tasted a mouthful of braised fish.

This braised fish was too good-looking. The plate was even decorated with shredded green onions and lotus flowers carved from turnips. He had thought that the taste of the fish would definitely not be too good.

It was flashy and unreal.

“Some things might look good on the outside, but they might not be delicious. ”

“Some things might not look good on the outside, but the taste was surprisingly good. ”

But what Chang Yu did not expect was that the taste of the fish was actually so good.

“There was not even the slightest bit of fishy smell. It was fresh and delicious, and there was also a faint spicy taste. ”

It was very stunning.

It made people want to swallow their tongues together.

“Chang Yu’s expression changed very obviously. Then he looked at Ye Zhuo. “Ye, how do you make this braised fish?” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Fry it in edible oil first, then add the bean paste, onion, ginger, and garlic to stir-fry it into red oil. Lastly, add the fish and water. Oh right, also add half a cup of rice wine. This way, the fish will be fresh and not fishy.” ”

“Chang Yu took out his phone and continued, “I want to memorize these steps. When I go back, I’ll let my mother learn how to make it too.” ”

Yin Wei tasted the boiled meat slices that she had ordered.

The meat slices tasted very tender.

“It was smooth and refreshing. After one bite, a mouth full of spicy and fresh fragrance made people squint their eyes in satisfaction. ”

Yin Wei couldn’t even care about talking anymore. She gave ye Zao a thumbs up.

“Wei Xingzhi, who was sitting across from her, was also conquered by ye Zao’s craftsmanship. ”

The few of them were eating very well.

They didn’t want to talk at all.

They even forgot about their body shape management.

“They were afraid that the dishes on their plates would be eaten up in the next second, and they didn’t even let go of the vegetable soup. ”

This was what Lu Qi saw when he walked out of the kitchen.

The four members of the red team surrounded the small table and were eating happily.

They had eaten?

Their red team had actually eaten!

It turned out that the aroma of braised fish that he smelled just now was the red team’s...

Who was the person in charge of cooking for the Red Team?

Lu Qi thought for a moment.

“Then, her eyes were filled with disbelief. ”

Ye Zao?

Could it be that these dishes were cooked by ye Zao?

Was Ye Zao that amazing?

Or could it be...

That the program team had opened the back door for ye Zao?

These dishes were definitely not cooked by ye Zao himself!

“With Ye Zao’s skills, how could she cook the dishes so well! ? ”

Definitely Not!

“Thinking of this, Lu Qi narrowed her eyes. ”

“Seeing Lu Qi coming over, Wei xingzhi hurriedly said, “Lu Qi, you guys haven’t eaten yet, right? Why Don’t you come over and have some to fill your stomach first?” ”

“Lu Qi had been busy for a long afternoon, so she was already hungry. Now that she saw such an alluring meal, how could Lu Qi endure it? ”

But she had to endure it even if she couldn’t!

“Even if she starved to death, she wouldn’t eat anything from the Red Team. ”

“Lu Qi smiled and said, “There’s no need. We can start eating soon.” ”

“Since Lu Qi wasn’t willing to come over, Wei Xingzhi no longer forced her. ”

“After the red team finished eating, the two men volunteered to wash the dishes. After all, the ones cooking tonight were ye Zhuo and Yin Wei. ”

“After Wei Xingzhi and Chang Yu finished washing the dishes, the blue team started preparing the meal. ”

The food was very sumptuous.

It was also four dishes and one soup.

“If they didn’t eat ye Zao’s dishes again, Wei Xingzhi and Changyu would definitely think that song Chenyu’s four dishes and one soup looked very good. ”
