Ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing had been quite busy recently. It was not easy for them to spare a day during Bai Jingshu’s labor.

“Ye Zhuo walked to Bai Jingshu’s side and said with a smile, “Sister-in-law, we’ll be going back first.” ”

“Bai Jingshu said with a smile, “Hurry up and go back. We’ve wasted so much of your time.”Her labor was not a big deal to begin with. Bai Jingshu was really a little embarrassed that she had wasted so much of everyone’s time. ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Sister-in-law, we’re family.” ” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“After saying that, ye Zao used his little finger to gently poke the little guy next to him. He said gently, “Little Tiezhu, aunt is going home.” ”

“After a night, the little guy was much whiter than last night. He felt that someone was poking him with his finger. The little guy stuck out his tongue and licked his lips. He even smiled. ”

“Seeing this, Bai Jingshu said in surprise, “He smiled. He smiled.” ”

“Ye Zao explained, “This is a dream smile. It’s an involuntary reaction. It’s not a reaction to the surrounding environment or a natural expression. Under normal circumstances, a newborn baby will not smile until about two months old.” ”

“”Oh, I see,”Bai Jingshu said. ”

“After saying that, Bai Jingshu continued, “Zao, you know a lot. You’ll definitely know more about taking care of babies than I do.” ”

“Ye Zao said, “I’m a doctor after all.” ”

“Bai Jingshu looked at ye Zao with admiration in her eyes. She smiled and said, “From now on, tie Zhu will learn medical skills from aunt.” ”

“”Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly and said with a smile, “But it depends on the child’s wishes.” ”

“Some children liked medicine, while others didn’t. ”

Bai Jingshu nodded. “That’s true.”

Ye Zao and Cen Shaoqing greeted everyone and prepared to leave.

“”Brother, Sister Zao, are you leaving?”At this moment, Kobayashi, who had just woken up from his afternoon nap, rubbed his eyes and asked the two of them. ”

“”Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly and reached out to Pat Kobayashi’s head. “Goodbye, Zhizhi.” ”

“”Sister Zao, you called me by the wrong name,”Little Lin Zhi said with a serious look on his face. “You don’t care about me at all.” ”

“Ye Zao instantly reacted. He smiled and said, “Goodbye, Little Iron Egg.” ”

“”That’s more like it!”Little Lin Zhi continued, “Goodbye, Sister Zao. Goodbye, Brother.” ”

“Goodbye.”

“Old Mrs. Cen followed behind and instructed, “Shaoqing, drive slowly.” ”

“I know.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Old Mrs. Cen was still a little worried. She followed them out of the door and said, “You must drive slowly.” ”

“Okay.”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Don’t worry, Grandma Cen. I’m here. I’ll keep an eye on him.” ”

“Okay.”Old Mrs. Cen nodded.

The two of them got into the car.

“Cen Shaoqing placed the Buddha beads between his thumb and index finger and continued, “Did you notice a problem?” ”

“What problem?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“Cen Shaoqing started the engine and opened his thin lips. “Every time when you were with me, Grandma would tell me to drive slower.” ”

“Ye Zhuo curved his lips slightly. “When you were alone, didn’t she tell you?” ”

“”Never,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“After that, CEN Shaoqing continued, “That’s why you’re Grandma’s biological granddaughter.” ”

“Ye Zhuo said, “You were sent here to pay the phone bill.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing said in all seriousness, “It’s really possible.” ”

“Before long, the car arrived at the entrance of the base. ”

Cen Shaoqing went around to the front passenger seat and opened the car door for ye Zhuo.

“The two of them walked side by side. Although they didn’t do anything, they gave off the feeling that they were an immortal couple. They were stunned by the sight of the base staff. ”

Why was it that they couldn’t get tired of such scenes every day?

Perhaps it was because people couldn’t hate beautiful things.

“Why do you think Master Five and Miss Ye have such a good relationship?”

“They don’t seem to quarrel.”

“Master Five is very afraid of Miss Ye. How would he dare to quarrel with Miss Ye!”

“Is master five strict with his wife?”

“”Yes, don’t you know?” ”

“Qin Xue looked at the scene in front of her, and a look of envy flashed across her eyes. She was hired into the base as a special talent a year ago. ”

“From the day she came to the base, Qin Xue had watched ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing go out together every day. ”

“It was said that flowers do not bloom for a hundred days, but it did not seem to be the case with Cen Shaoqing and Ye Zhuo. ”

Qin Xue had thought that an outstanding person like Cen Shaoqing could not be trapped between one woman. It was only now that she understood that a love that was evenly matched was the most beautiful.

“Cen Shaoqing was very outstanding, and Ye Zhuo was even more outstanding. ”
