“”Sen, remember what I said. Although Zhao Xueyin is your biological sister, she is not the same as you. Previously in the hospital, she was acting. She did not treat you as her brother at all. She just treated you as a wall ladder. So, do not believe her.” ”

“Previously, with him around, he could still suppress Zhao Xueyin. Once he left, Ye Sen would not be able to defeat Zhao Xueyin. ”

“Ye Sen was so soft-hearted, and Zhao Xueyin was his sister. Zhao Zhenfei was worried that ye Sen would be deceived by Zhao Xueyin. ”

“After being with Zhao Xueyin and her father for so many years, Zhao zhenfei knew Zhao Xueyin too well. ”

“In Zhao Xueyin’s eyes, there was no kinship. ”

“In order to achieve her goal, she could do anything! ”

It was said that Ye Sen was her half-brother.

“If necessary, Zhao Xueyin could even sacrifice him as her father. ”

“”Alright, visiting time is up.”A policeman walked in from outside. ”

“Zhao zhenfei held ye Sen’s hand and refused to let go. “Sen, remember what I said.” ”

Ye Sen nodded.

“Zhao Zhenfei looked at ye Sen and cried, “Sen, don’t you have anything to say to Dad?” ”

“Ever since he entered this room, he had been the one speaking. ”

Ye Sen did not say a single word.

“The last time, Zhao Zhenfei wanted to hear ye Sen’s words. ” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Ye Sen looked at Zhao Zhenfei and said very seriously, “Be a good person in your next life.” ”

“Hearing this, Zhao Zhenfei cried out bitterly. ”

In his next life.

He would definitely be a good person in his next life.

Definitely!

“Seeing Zhao zhenfei like this, Ye Sen felt a little uncomfortable. ”

“However, he had brought this upon himself. ”

“When he had done those things, he should have thought of today. ”

He walked out of the police station.

“Ye Sen first went to the nearby orphanage to show his love. Then, he bought a lot of dog food, chicken, duck meat, and went to the nearby stray cats and dogs rescue station. ”

This shelter was very big.

It was Ye Sen’s first time here.

“It was different from what he had imagined. The place was very clean, and there was almost no strange smell. ”

“Ye Sen brought a large amount of supplies here. The station manager welcomed him, “Mr. Ye, there is a lack of people like you in society now.” ”

Ye Sen was very embarrassed by the praise.

“Because he rarely had time to pay attention to these things, the reason he came to show his love was to atone for Zhao Zhenfei’s sins. ”

“Ye Sen continued, “Can you take me to see the cats and dogs here?” ”

“”Yes.”The station master nodded. “Mr. Ye, please follow me over here.” ”

Ye Sen followed the station master’s footsteps.

“Soon, the two of them arrived at the large courtyard behind them. ”

“The courtyard was very large, covering an area of two to three acres. ”

All the dogs and cats were kept in captivity here.

“At this moment, Ye Sen suddenly saw a familiar figure. ”

The girl had a slim figure and was wearing a black windbreaker. She was feeding a group of dogs.

“The station manager introduced, “What a coincidence, Mr. Ye. That little girl’s surname is ye too. She has sponsored our rescue station for more than a year. She comes here almost every half a month.” ”

“Not only did she come here in person every half a month, but she also transferred 20,000 yuan to the account of the rescue station every month. No matter the weather, she was very punctual. ”

Ye Sen’s eyes curved. “She’s my big niece.”

“When he said the last three words, his eyes were full of pride. ”

“He felt that he must have saved the Milky Way in his previous life, so he had such a good big niece and an excellent big nephew. ”

“”Really?”The station manager said in surprise, “Are the two of you really relatives?” ”

It was rare for a family to be so caring.

Ye Sen nodded. “Really.”

“After saying that, Ye Sen raised his voice and shouted, “Zao Zao!” ”

Ye Zao looked back slightly and saw ye Sen. He was also somewhat incredulous and jogged over. “Uncle! Why are you here?”

Ye Sen did not hide anything. “I’m here to atone for Zhao Zhenfei’s sins.”

Ye Zao nodded slightly. “He has already confessed?”

“Yes.”

“Ye Sen continued, “I heard from the station chief that you often come here?” ”

“Ye Zhuo patted the head of a Tibetan Mastiff. “Not really.”About once every half a month. Her original plan was to come once a week, but she was too busy, so she could only change it to once every half a month. ”

Ye Zhuo liked small animals very much.

It was a pity.

“In the era when she came to live, animals like cats and dogs were extinct long before she was born because of the changes in their living environment. ”

“Therefore, after she came to this world, she not only paid attention to orphanages and welfare homes, but also paid special attention to stray cats and dogs. ”

“In this world, not only was everyone equal, life and life were even more so. ”
