“Zhang Qingqing sniffed. “Lizi, I know I’m not good enough for Lin Ze in your heart. But this child is indeed Lin Ze’s. As a mother, can I even be mistaken about who the father of my child is?” ”

“Hearing this, an Lizi was stunned. ”

She never dreamed that Zhang Qingqing would say that Lin Ze was the father of the child.

“For no reason, Zhang Qingqing could not say such a thing either. ”

“What, what was going on? ”

“An Lizi took a deep breath and looked up at Zhang Qingqing. “Qingqing, are you really not joking with me?” ”

This joke was not funny at all.

“”Lizi, do you think I would joke with you about something like this?”Zhang Qingqing looked at an Lizi with a serious expression on her face. ”

“An lizi continued, “Then, then when did you two get together?” ”

They even had a child!

This was too unbelievable.

“Lin Ze was only 20 years old, and he was going to be a father? ”

Zhang Qingqing sighed. “It was my birthday.”

“Hearing this, an Lizi was even more surprised. “On Your Birthday?” ”

“”Yes.”Zhang Qingqing nodded. “On my birthday, everyone was drunk. I don’t know how I ended up with Lin Ze...”what she said next made it difficult for Zhang Qingqing to say. ”

“”When I woke up, I was already lying beside Lin Ze. There was also Luo Hong on the bed. If you don’t believe me, you can ask Lin Ze.” ”

What did Luo Hong represent?

Luo Hong represented a woman’s chastity.

“She had even gotten pregnant with Lin Ze’s child, her most precious first time. Lin Ze would definitely be responsible for her! ”

An Lizi frowned.

“If everything was as Zhang Qingqing said, then Lin Ze’s situation would be troublesome. ”

What should she do now?

“Based on her understanding of Lin Ze, he wasn’t such a casual person. Why was this time... ”

An Lizi was puzzled.

“Zhang Qingqing calmly observed an Lizi’s expression, she continued, “Lizi, you can take a look at my report. I’m currently one month pregnant, and I’m only with Lin Ze... so, if the father of the child isn’t Lin Ze, who else could it be?” ”

“An Lizi looked at the report in her hand. It showed that Zhang Qingqing was already four weeks pregnant! According to the time calculation, Zhang Qingqing’s pregnancy date was indeed the day of her birthday. ”

Could it be that the child in Zhang Qingqing’s stomach was really Lin Ze’s?

“Actually, Zhang Qingqing was already two months pregnant, but her pregnancy didn’t show up in the early stages, so she used some means to bribe the doctor to change her pregnancy date to four weeks. ”

“”Qingqing, don’t worry,”an lizi continued, “Think about it carefully. What happened between you and Ah Ze that day? Did a misunderstanding happen?” ”

An Lizi found it hard to accept this.

“Not to mention an Lizi, even Lin Jincheng and ye Shu found it hard to accept. ”

“Zhang Qingqing was a good friend of an Lizi, and Zhang Qingqing and ye Shu only knew Lin ze through an Lizi. ”

“An Lizi felt that she had something to do with this matter, and she felt very uncomfortable. ”

“”Lizi, what do you mean by that?”Zhang Qingqing looked at an Lizi, she questioned angrily, “Can I still joke about my chastity and my child? So in your heart, I’m such a despicable and shameless person!” ”

“At the end of her sentence, Zhang Qingqing’s eyes were full of self-mockery. In addition, there were tears in her eyes, and it was very unbearable to look at her. ”

“”No! No!”Seeing that Zhang Qingqing had misunderstood her.., an lizi quickly explained, “Qingqing, I didn’t mean that. Please don’t think about it! I just feel that everything happened too suddenly. I can’t accept it!” ”

“”Then what do you mean?”Zhang Qingqing looked at an Lizi, then, she continued, “Didn’t you look down on me from the beginning? You thought that I wasn’t worthy of Lin Ze! Yes, I admit that I wasn’t worthy of Lin Ze. But now that things have already happened, what can I do? Could it be that if Lin Ze isn’t willing, I can still force Lin Ze to agree?” ”

It had always been men who forced women. How could a woman force a man?

“Even if the sky was broken, Lin Ze was the one who took advantage of this! ”

“Zhang Qingqing had a feeling that she was pregnant with a son. The rich and powerful families paid the most attention to the issue of children. In the future, her son would be the heir of the Lin family. ”

“Thinking of this, Zhang Qingqing’s eyes were filled with pride. ”

“Hearing this, an Lizi frowned. ”

“It had to be said that what Zhang Qingqing said was indeed reasonable. “Qingqing, calm down first. Don’t be so anxious. I apologize for what I did just now.” ”𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
