Who Was Duanmu Feng?

“She was the daughter of the Duanmu family, the main ally of the s galaxy. ”

The daughter of the Duanmu family was born with the most noble status and was the role model for all the women in the world.

What was a lowly person from earth?

“If it weren’t for the fact that Young Master Dongli was born on Earth, she wouldn’t even be qualified to carry his shoes. ”

There was no need for Duanmu Fengyu to make such a comparison.

“”Fengyu,”Mrs. Duanmu patted duanmu Fengyu’s hand, “The most important thing for you now is to greet Dongli and his family in your best condition.” ”

“Hearing this, Duanmu Fengyu turned to look at Mrs. Duanmu, her eyes full of disbelief. “Mom, do you want me to curry favor with those low-level Earthlings?” ” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

How could that be possible!

She was born to be the most honorable person. How could she curry favor with those ordinary people?

No.

She couldn’t do it.

“Mrs. Duanmu continued, “They are not other people. They are your future mother-in-law and grandmother respectively.” ”

Mother-in-law?

Grandmother?

Just Them?

“The look in Duanmu Feng’s eyes became more obvious. “Mom, what are you talking about! Only aunt is my mother-in-law!” ”

“When it came to mother-in-law, she only recognized Duanmu Huangfei. ”

“As for that person who came from God knows where, what kind of mother-in-law was she? ”

“To put it nicely, she was Cen Haifeng’s wife on Earth. ”

“To put it bluntly, she was a mistress. Moreover, she was the kind of mistress who did not have the slightest self-awareness. ”

“No matter what happened between Zhou Xiang and Cen Haifeng on Earth, it was all in the past. Cen Haifeng now had a new family. If it were anyone else, they would not disturb Cen Haifeng’s life anymore. ”

But this shameless woman actually had the nerve to come.

“The first half of Cen Haifeng’s life belonged to her, and the second half belonged to Duanmu Fengfei. This was very fair! ”

“”Fengyu, you have to be sensible.”Mrs. Duanmu said earnestly, “Mom knows that it’s very unfair for you to do this, but now, you have to get their approval. Your uncle didn’t even care about your aunt’s face for them. Do you think he will indulge you?” ”

Mrs. Duanmu was a person who knew how to judge the situation.

“Cen Haifeng’s memories had been awakened, and the forbidden spell had been removed. The current situation was very unfavorable to Duanmu Fengyu! ”

“If Duanmu Fengyu wanted to marry into the Cen family, she had to first obtain their approval. ”

“If she wanted to achieve great things, she had to be unrestrained. ”

“Although this matter was very unfair to Duanmu Fengyu, Duanmu Fengyu had to do it! ”

“Uncle Likes Me the most!”Duanmu Mufeng said.

She didn’t have to worry about that.

“”That was in the past,”Mrs. Duanmu continued, “But it’s different now.” ”

“In the past, Cen Haifeng had always thought that he and Duanmu Fengfei’s children were training on Earth. In addition, Duanmu Fengyu was his default daughter-in-law. Of course, he would like Duanmu Feng and treat her as his own daughter. ”

“But now, Cen Haifeng remembered everything. He had a son and a daughter, so why would he care about Duanmu Fengyu and this person who had nothing to do with him. ”

“”Fengyu,”Mrs. Duanmu looked at Duanmu Fengyu. “You have no choice but to lower your head under the eaves. I believe that with your intelligence, you will be able to take down that group of people easily.” ”

“It was not that Mrs. Duanmu was boasting, but Duanmu Fengyu was indeed very powerful. ”

“Other than Miss Ye, who was previously famous in the s galaxy, there was probably no one else who was a match for Duanmu Feng and her daughter. ”

Mrs. Duanmu even felt that even miss ye couldn’t compare to her daughter.

“As long as Duanmu Feng and her daughter nodded, they would definitely be able to control that group of people. ”

“Hearing this, Duanmu Feng and her daughter frowned slightly. “Mother, must this be the case?” ”

“Yes.”Mrs. Duanmu nodded.

“Duanmu Fengyu’s face was full of unwillingness. She was used to being high and mighty. Not only was she the eldest daughter of the Duanmu family, but she was also the future First Lady of the alliance. No matter where she went, she would always be carefully fawned over by others, since when did she have to fawn over others? ”

“Moreover, those people were low-level earthlings whom she had always looked down upon. ”

“Mom?”

“Be Good.”Mrs. Duanmu patted Duanmu Fengyu’s back. “It’s okay to endure it.”

“But I can’t endure it!”

“Mrs. Duanmu continued, “Your aunt has even endured her prison sentence. What can’t you endure?” ”

“When she heard this, Duanmu Fengyu’s expression changed. ”

“”If you endure this period of time, you’ll be the best!” ”

Duanmu fengyu nodded. “Got it.”

“Seeing that Duanmu Fengyu finally nodded, Mrs. Duanmu smiled and said, “If you can’t bear it, you will mess up the big plan. Many years later, you will definitely thank yourself for enduring this moment.” ”
