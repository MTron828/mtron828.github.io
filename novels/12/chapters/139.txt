Chapter 140: 083: great abuse of SCUM! Great Motherly Love 6

“You!”Ye Shu shook her head helplessly. “I don’t even know what to say about you!”

Around five o’clock in the evening.

Ye Zhuo came back with food and a computer.

As soon as he entered the ward, he heard ye Shu and ye Sen talking and laughing.

Ye Zhuo took out the lunchbox and handed it to ye Sen. “Uncle, you’re hungry too, right? I’ve Fried your favorite beef noodle and a bowl of Soup for you.”

Ye Sen smiled and took the lunchbox. “My niece is still the best!”

“That’s a must.”Ye Zhuo opened another lunchbox. It was some soup that could replenish blood. “Mom, let me feed you.”

Ye Shu smiled and said, “You Child! Mom’s left hand was injured, not crippled! How can it be so exaggerated! Do I need you to feed me after eating?”

“No!”Ye Zhuo scooped a spoonful of soup and handed it to Ye Shu’s mouth. “I have to feed you!”

Seeing ye Zhuo like this.

Ye Shu could only open her mouth to receive it, her eyes filled with happiness.

The patient who had just moved in from the next hospital bed.., she said enviously, “Big sister, you really raised a good daughter! Not only is she beautiful, but she also cares for others! Unlike my three sons, who only know how to anger me all day long! Now, I’ve broken my leg, and I haven’t even seen a trace of her!”

Ye Shu smiled and said, “My daughter! There’s really nothing to say!”

After feeding ye Shu the soup, Ye Zao looked at ye Sen. “Uncle, I’ll stay at the hospital to accompany my mother tonight. You should go back quickly!”

Ye Sen said, “I’ll stay. You Go back.”

“Don’t you know that there’s a difference between a man and a woman?”Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly.

Ye Sen was stunned. He could only listen to Ye Zao and prepare to go back. He would come back tomorrow morning to replace ye Zao.

“Uncle, I’ll send you down.”

Ye Sen was about to say that he did not need to send him down. He knew the way.

But he swallowed his words. Ye Zao naturally would not send him down for no reason. He definitely had something to say to him.

Just as ye Sen thought, ye Zao indeed had something to say to him.

“Uncle, I’ve already checked. Lin Fuhai raised a relative called Wen die outside. Their son is already six years old. Recently, Lin Fuhai is preparing to buy a school house for their son.”

“Really?”Sen Ye looked at Burning Ye in surprise.

His brother-in-law had always been proud of himself. He didn’t expect that he would do something like raising a woman outside.

He didn’t know how burning ye found out.

Although Sen ye was a bit curious, he didn’t ask. He always knew that his nephew wasn’t an ordinary person.

Burning ye nodded and continued, “Xuan Lin paid a witness to be a witness when she represented the client in the lawsuit. I’ve sent the evidence to your email. You should know what to do, right?”

Ye Zao did not want to let go of any of these people from the Ye family.

As for Xue Lin.

Once the Lin family fell, her rich second generation boyfriend would probably leave him immediately.

Ye Sen nodded, “Don’t Worry, Zao Zao! I know what to do! The Lin family has settled this, what about the Ye Family?”

“Don’t worry, I won’t let them off easy.”Ye Zao narrowed his eyes, a cold light flashed in his eyes.

Ye Sen instructed ye Zao, “Then I’ll go back first. Call me if there’s anything.”

“Okay, I know.”

Watching Ye Sen’s back disappear on the road, ye Zao turned around and walked towards the hospital.

After Ye Sen returned to the company, he immediately contacted the detective agency and asked them to investigate Lin Haifu and Wen die.

Then, he opened his email and sorted out the evidence that ye Zao had sent over. He then anonymously sent it to the victim’s family.

The detective agency was very efficient. The next day, they took a bunch of photos of Lin Fuhai and the mistress.

Ye Sen packaged all these photos and sent them to ye Shuang.

When ye Shuang received these photos, she was so angry that she wanted to stab the couple to death with a knife!

“Lin Fuhai, you heartless man! When I was with you, you had nothing! Now, you dare to betray me!”

It was one thing to raise a third son!

But now he even had a child!

Ye Shuang couldn’t care about anything else. She rushed to Wen Die’s address and slammed the door.

If it was possible, she even wanted to tear down this house!

“Who is it?”Wen Die came to open the door.

“B * Tch! B * Tch!”Ye Shuang gave Wen die a slap.

Wen die was stunned by the slap. She covered her face and shouted, “Who are you! What right do you have to hit me?” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Because I’m Lin Fuhai’s wife! You Bitch! Shameless! I’ll beat you to death today!”Ye Shuang punched and kicked Wen die.
