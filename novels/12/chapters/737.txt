“Chapter 738: 166: Can Ye Zao do it? Old Lady Lin, who had fainted from anger”

Translator: 549690339

She wanted Old Lady Lin to see her defeat ye Zao with her own eyes!

“Hearing this, Old Lady Lin’s eyes lit up. “Really?””

“Of course it’s true!”Feng Xianxian nodded.

“Old Lady Lin smiled and said, “Good, good, good! Very good! Xianxian, your grandma will definitely participate in the competition!”Old Lady Lin was very excited now, when she had recommended Feng Xianxian to master Yu previously, master Yu had directly rejected her. He had even said that Feng Xianxian was not as outstanding as ye Zao!”

“If Feng Xianxian were to win against ye Zao in this assessment, master Yu would lose face.”

“At that time, master Yu would definitely regret his decision!”

Old Lady Lin could not wait to see the look of regret on master Yu’s face.

Just thinking about it made her extremely excited.

“After the assessment, it was not whether Master Yu was willing to accept Feng Xianxian as his disciple, but whether Feng Xianxian was willing to be Master Yu’s disciple.”

“The More Old Lady Lin thought about it, the happier she became. She patted Feng Xianxian on the shoulder and said, “Xianxian, Grandma believes that you will definitely get first place in the assessment!””

“Feng Qianxian said a little embarrassedly, “Sister Ye Zao will also be participating in this assessment. I only hope that I can get closer to Sister Ye Zao. As for first place, I don’t even dare to think about it. Since master Yu likes Sister Ye Zao so much, it means that Sister Ye Zao has great wisdom. The first place will definitely belong to Sister Ye Zao.””

“At the mention of Ye Zao, Old Lady Lin was a little unhappy. “She can’t compete with you.””

“Ye Zao had been poisoned when he was young. His brain was not sharp to begin with, and he had not received any good education. How could she be compared to Feng Qianxian?”

“Although ye Zao had some small achievements in the scientific and technological world, could the scientific and technological world be compared to the literary world?”

A hint of guilt flashed across Feng Qianxian’s eyes. “I’ve let Sister Ye Zao Down. I don’t know if Sister Ye Zao will be able to forgive me when we meet at the assessment competition...”

“”Silly child! You weren’t the one who did those things! It has nothing to do with you!”Old Lady Lin continued, “Don’t blame yourself for everything.””

“Feng Xianxian sighed. “But I’m still my mother’s daughter. Grandma, the better you treat me, the more I feel guilty...””

“At the end of her sentence, Feng Xianxian’s eyes turned red.”

Old Lady Lin was heartbroken. She felt that Feng Xianxian was a sensible and good child.

...

“Lin Qingxuan and Xia Xiaoman’s wedding was booked at a five-star hotel in the capital. The wedding was to be held tomorrow. At this moment, a few sisters-in-law of the Lin family were busy arranging the wedding venue.”

“The wedding looked simple, but it was actually very complicated. There were many things that needed to be done personally.”

Ye Shu also put down the work in the restaurant and followed the three sisters-in-law to arrange the venue.

“Lin Qingxuan was very touched when he saw the whole family busy with his work. “Sister-in-law, sister-in-law, sister-in-law, and sister-in-law, thank you for your hard work.””

“Wu Mei smiled and said, “We’re all family. It’s too much of an outsider to say that it’s not hard work!””

“After saying that, Wu Mei asked again, “By the way, you just went back. What did mom say?””

“Lin Qingxuan said, “Mom still said the same thing. Sister-in-law will have to trouble you and Big Brother to help us host the wedding tomorrow.””

“”Okay, no problem.”Wu Mei nodded.”

“After Lin Qingxuan left, Zhang Zhenzhen ridiculed, “I don’t know what the Old Lady is thinking! She has already caused fourth brother a lot of trouble in the first half of her life, and now she’s still acting like this! Isn’t she afraid that fourth brother will disown her?””

It was also because Lin Qingxuan was honest enough.

“If it were anyone else, they probably wouldn’t be able to tolerate such a mother.”

“Just because of Old Lady Lin’s family background, Lin Qingxuan sacrificed more than half of her life’s happiness and still lived in guilt towards Zhao shuning every day.”

“If it weren’t for ye Zao finding out, Lin Qingxuan would still be kept in the dark!”

“Therefore, Zhang Zhenzhen had always thought that ye Zao was the Lin family’s little lucky star.”

“If it were not for ye Zao, the dark clouds that shrouded the Lin family would not have dissipated so quickly!”

“Yang Wenyin continued, “Don’t you know the old lady well? She just wants to make all the decisions in the family, big and small! If anyone dares to go against her, then their good days will come to an end! “It’s all thanks to US splitting up early! “Otherwise, there will be a lot of arguments!””

“Although Wu Mei did not say anything, she agreed with Yang Wenyin and Zhang Zhenzhen’s words.”

Old Lady Lin was indeed a little pretentious. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Zhang Zhenzhen turned to look at Ye Shu. “Fifth sister-in-law, the four of you have always lived with the old lady. How can you tolerate her?””
