“Chapter 604: 144: a powerful slap to the face, a glorious sight! 6”

“Okay.”

Aunt Zhang nodded and walked towards the east courtyard.

Lin Jincheng arrived very quickly.

“What’s the matter?”

“Old Lady Lin’s face was stern. “Your daughter brought back a shady character. As a father, you’re not going to interfere?””

“Mom!”Lin Jincheng held back the anger in his heart. “That’s not a shady character. She’s searing hot’s classmate! She’s our guest!”

“Old Lady Lin said angrily, “How dare the daughter of a herdsman call herself a guest? When did the threshold of our Lin family become so low? Birds of a feather flock together. Hanging out with this kind of person all day long! Sooner or later, she will lead Ah Ze Astray as well!””

Old Lady Lin attached great importance to the younger generation’s circle of friends.

She believed that making friends was the same as talking about marriage.

The poor were never qualified to make friends with the rich.

Because the poor could never reach the level of the rich.

“Between friends, either I assimilate you, or you assimilate me.”

Different circles saw different worlds.

“If the rich were assimilated by the poor, sooner or later they would become poor.”

“Lin Jincheng looked at Old Mrs. Lin and said, “Do you have to force our family of four out of this house?””

There are four brothers in Lam Kam Shing.

Except Lin Qingxuan is abroad all the year round.

“The other three brothers are in three directions, southeast and west of China.”

“Only he remained in the capital, which was located in the north.”

“The reason why he had been enduring not to move out with Ye Shu and the children was that this was the Lin family’s old residence, a place left behind by Old Master Lin. When Old Master Lin passed away, he had instructed him, he had to take good care of the Lin family manor and Old Lady Lin.”

“Secondly, it was for the sake of Old Lady Lin bringing up Lin Ze.”

“But if Old Lady Lin continued to act like this, he would immediately bring ye Shu and the others out.”

Old Lady Lin was stunned. “What are you saying?” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Lin Jincheng said, “I’m saying, if you interfere with the matters of our family of four again, I will immediately move out of this house.””

Old Lady Lin’s face instantly turned pale.

She could not believe that Lin Jincheng would actually say such heinous words to her.

She was clearly doing this for Lin Jincheng’s own good.

“But not only did Lin Jincheng not appreciate her kindness, he even treated her like this.”

Old Lady Lin was so angry that her entire body was trembling.

“After Lin Jincheng left, Aunt Zhang advised Old Lady Lin, “Old Lady, don’t be too angry. Jincheng is a filial child. This must be some long-tongued woman who instigated something! Otherwise, he would definitely not say such heinous words.””

Who was this gossipy woman referring to?

“Of course, it was ye Shu!”

“Old Madam Lin thumped her chest. “I shouldn’t have let him go to Yun Jing that year! Ye Shu, that b * tch, she will get her retribution!”Old Madam Lin was very regretful now, why didn’t she take a tough stance back then and let Lin Jin Cheng and Feng Qianhua take the certificate.”

“Seeing old madam Lin like this, the corners of Aunt Zhang’s mouth curled up.”

On the other side.

The Feng family.

“Ever since Feng Qianhua returned to the Feng family, she had been keeping a straight face.”

She never thought that her daughter would one day lose to Ye Shu’s bastard child.

Shameful!

It was really too shameful!

“Feng Qianqian looked at Feng Qianhua carefully, not daring to make a sound.”

“After a long while, Feng Qianqian gathered her courage and said, “Mom...””

Feng Qianhua looked up at Feng Xianxian. “Do you know what you did wrong?”

Feng Xianxian did not say anything.

She had worked very hard since she was young to meet Feng Qianhua’s standards.

“Other than at school, she usually rested at home and had almost no personal space.”

That was because she was busy attending all kinds of training classes.

Her time had not let her down.

“Over the years, Feng Xianxian had always been the child of other families that other parents had mentioned.”

She ranked third in the college entrance examination in the city.

She won third place in the science and Technology Awards during her university years.

She passed nine stages of go.

“She was proficient in all kinds of music, chess, calligraphy, and painting, and she could speak English and French.”

She thought that she was already very outstanding.

But this was not enough.

Who would have thought that ye Zhuo was actually the Dr. YC of the Science and Technology World?

“”Your fault is that you’re not as outstanding as ye Zhuo!”Feng Qianhua looked at Feng Xianxian and said with a dark face, “You’re my daughter, Feng Qianhua. I won’t allow you to be inferior to others!””

Especially since that person was ye Shu’s daughter!

Why did that B * Tch ye Shu have to suppress her in every way?

Feng Qianhua was unwilling to accept this!

“After a long while, Feng Qianqian finally said, “Mom, I know I’m wrong! I’ll work hard in the future!””

“Feng Qianhua said, “I plan to apply for a female Durban for you.””

Female Durban?
