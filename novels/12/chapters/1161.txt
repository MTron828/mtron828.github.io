“Chapter 1162: 251: After learning the truth, mother-in-law Zhou was filled with regret! 4”

Translator: 549690339

A normal person wouldn’t do such a thing.

“Ma jianyue smiled and said, “Mom, why are you arguing with a servant! If she knew the ways of the world, she wouldn’t have to be a servant!” ”

“”That’s true.”Mother-in-law Zhou nodded and continued, “After so many days, I wonder how Aunt Wang’s lover is doing?” ”

“Hearing this, Ma Jiayue’s face turned pale, “Mom, I think it’s probably because of her lover that Aunt Wang resigned! Think about it, Ye Zhuo, who hasn’t even graduated from university, doesn’t know any medical skills! Aunt Wang’s lover must have taken her medicine and her condition worsened, so she had to resign to take care of her lover!” ”

That was the only thing she could say at the moment.

“Otherwise, Granny Zhou would definitely go all out to get to the bottom of it. ”

Granny Zhou frowned. “Is that so?”

“Ma Jiayue nodded, “That must be the case! “Otherwise, why would auntie Wang resign when she’s fine? “I heard from the butler that Auntie Wang’s expression was extremely ugly when she resigned! “Not only did she want to resign, but I also heard from the housekeeper that Aunt Wang wants to move!” ”

“Move? Is it that serious?”Granny Zhou frowned deeply.

“”Yes, it is quite serious.”Ma jianyue continued, “Otherwise, Aunt Wang wouldn’t have resigned.” ”

“Hearing that, Granny Zhou said with a face full of fear, “Jianyue! Fortunately, I listened to you and didn’t take the prescription given by ye Zao. Otherwise, I would be the one whose condition worsened!” ” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Granny Zhou felt extremely lucky just thinking about it.

“She was already old. If her condition worsened because of this incident, she might die. ”

“Born as a person, who wasn’t afraid of death. ”

Although it was very uncomfortable to have diabetes.

But it was better to be alive than dead.

“”Thank you, Jiayue! Our Zhou family has a daughter-in-law like you. It’s simply a blessing from our past life.”Granny Zhou turned her head to look at Ma Jiayue. ”

“Ma Jianyue was so frightened by Granny Zhou’s words of thanks that she broke out in a cold sweat. “Mom, what are you talking about? We are a family, there’s no need to thank us!” ”

“Fortunately, she was smart enough to dismiss Auntie Wang in advance. ”

“Otherwise, this matter would not be able to be resolved! ”

“Granny Zhou sighed, “It’s just a pity that Auntie Wang’s lover is only 45 years old! “He’s already in poor health. Now that his condition has worsened, how will he be able to live the rest of his life?”? “Previously, I saw that little girl, Ye Zhuo, was quite sensible. I didn’t think that she would use a fake prescription to harm others!”! “You really can’t judge a book by its cover!” ”

“Originally, Granny Zhou was quite fond of Ye Zhuo. She felt that the descendants of the Ye family were definitely not that bad. ”

“Now, it seemed that ye Zhuo was far inferior to Zhao Xueyin! ”

“It was also fortunate that Ma Jiayue had explained everything to Auntie Wang at that time. She told Auntie Wang to look for ye Zao if she had any problems with the food. Otherwise, there would still be a lot of nonsense to talk about. ”

“Thinking about how ye Zao almost made their family carry a human life, Granny Wang was even more displeased with ye Zao! ”

“Ma Jiayue said, “The culture of Chinese medicine is extensive and profound. She is only 20 years old. It is normal that she doesn’t know any medical skills! The little girl doesn’t have the ability and wants to be in the limelight, so she could only use a fake prescription to fool people! “Maybe she didn’t expect that this prescription would aggravate her condition!” ”

“Granny Zhou frowned. “If she wants to be in the limelight, she shouldn’t be in the limelight like this! She’s clearly taking people’s lives lightly! It’s just that it’s hard on Auntie Wang’s family.” ”

Granny Zhou was a kind-hearted person.

She couldn’t bear to see others suffer.

“Ma jiayue smiled and said, “Perhaps this is the life of Auntie Wang’s lover! “I already said that this prescription was useless. She was the one who insisted on using it! “She brought this upon herself. Who can she blame now? “As the saying goes, one learns from one’s mistakes. This may not be a bad thing for Auntie Wang. At the very least, after this incident, she won’t dare to randomly take other people’s prescriptions anymore!” ”

“Granny Zhou agreed with what Ma Jianyue said. “Jianyue, you’re right! Everything is fate. It’s not up to anyone!” ”

“These words made Ma Jianyue feel a little guilty. She immediately changed the topic. “Mom, I heard that you have an appointment with the old lady of the Wang family to watch the drama tomorrow, Right?” ”

“Yes.”Granny Zhou nodded.

“Ma jianyue continued, “Then have you chosen the clothes to wear for the drama? If you haven’t, I’ll help you choose.” ”

“Speaking of the clothes for the next day, Granny Zhou’s attention was immediately drawn away and she started to discuss with Ma Jiayue which clothes would look good. ”

“Seeing Granny Zhou like this, Ma Jiayue finally heaved a sigh of relief. ”

The next day.

Granny Zhou and her three older sisters made an appointment to go to the play together.
