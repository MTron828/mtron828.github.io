Ye Han nodded.

“Ye Shu continued, “Let’s not stand here any longer. Let’s quickly enter the house and talk inside.” ”

“Before the summer solstice arrived, the flowers and plants in the small courtyard were all blooming with all kinds of colors. Not only was it pleasing to the eye, but it also smelled good and made one feel refreshed. ”

The group of people entered the house.

On the other side.

S galaxy.

Manxing country.

Manxing was practicing calligraphy in the study when a knock on the door was heard.

Manxing immediately put down his pen and went to open the door himself.

“Master.”

“The person who came was Manxing’s master, Master Cao. ”

“Master Cao had been in Manxing country for many years, and all the sources of trouble and fortune came from him. In addition, he was really capable and treated Manxing very well, therefore, man Jiangshan and Zhao Dan made man Xing acknowledge master Cao as his teacher. ”

“Therefore, master Cao was well-loved in Manxing country. ”

Master Cao nodded and walked inside.

“MAN XING was also very respectful to master Cao, and immediately went to pour tea for him. ”

The tea here was not quite the same as the Tea Zhao Dan drank.

It was a grade three purple clove leaf that grew on Mount Yunwu.

“It was of the same class as the purple clove flower, but its effects were different. However, they were of the same class after all, so it was extremely precious. Ordinary people really couldn’t drink it. ”

“”Master, Drink your tea.”Man Xing passed the two mountains of tea that had been brewed to master Cao. ”

“Master Cao stretched out his hand and took a sip. He then said, “What have you been busy with these days?” ”

“Without waiting for man Xing to answer, master Cao Glanced at man Xing, he continued, “Xing ‘er, you are different from the other women in the world. You Are Talented. There is no need to put your thoughts in the courtyard. A Phoenix spreads its wings for three thousand miles. Why are you afraid of Ants?” ”

Master Cao had never seen a woman like man Xing.

She and the full moon were two extremes.

The full moon was the ultimate disaster.

The full moon was the ultimate blessing. It was born to be a king.

“Therefore, over the years, master Cao was willing to gather all his talent and focus on nurturing the full moon. He did not ask for anything, only for the full moon to rule the world. He wanted everyone to know his name. ”

“However, there was one thing that master Cao had never expected. ”

“That was, the full moon had actually become ye Zhuo, and even became the famous miss ye of Chang Yue. ”

“A calamity star, how could she have the orders of the monarch? ”

“One had to know that before this, the Chang Yue kingdom was just a pile of loose sand. Because of its advantageous terrain, the flames of war had been raging all year round. Just because of ye Zao, the Flames of war had disappeared. Master Cao had always felt that it was very inconceivable. ” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Therefore, master Cao had suggested that man Jiangshan take back ye Zao. ”

“Who knew that at this critical juncture, ye Zao had actually given up the position of monarch. ”

All of this was beyond master Cao’s expectations.

“Man Xing nodded and said gently, “Don’t worry, master. I know.” ”

“Master Cao’s thoughts were pulled back by man Xing. He continued, “What do you think about ye Zao’s Zen Throne?” ”

“MAN XING continued, “Elder sister treats ye Han like a younger brother. She must have thought about the sudden Zen throne for a long time, but...”man Xing paused. ”

“But what?”Master Cao immediately asked.

“”However, we can’t rule out that elder sister was schemed against. She thought that Ye Han was a dog that didn’t bite people, but she didn’t know that Ye Han was a fierce wolf.”MAN XING continued, “Master, I sent people to inquire about elder sister. After the Zen, elder sister disappeared.” ”

“At this point, man Xing sighed, and his eyes were slightly red. “I originally wanted to secretly bring elder sister back to reunite the family, but who knew...” ”

“Master Cao Glanced at man Xing and continued, “Ye Han was the one who set up ye Zao?” ”

“Man Xing nodded. “One day, I will definitely avenge my eldest sister!” ”

“Master Cao looked at man Xing and said earnestly, “You and ye Zao are two extremes, one disaster and one blessing. They are mutually reinforcing and counter each other. If you get too close to her, it won’t do you any good.” ”

“MAN XING continued, “But she is my elder sister after all. She has the same blood as me.” ”

“Seeing this, master Cao Sighed. ”

“Man Xing was a good child, but she was too soft-hearted. The full moon had no friendship with her, but she couldn’t let go of the full moon. She even wanted to take revenge for the full moon. ”

“It had been so many years, and nothing had changed. ”

“”Oh right, master.”Man Xing looked at master Cao and asked, “Has there been any news from the young master of Dongli?” ”

“The Old Master of the General Alliance was about to abdicate, and now all forces were looking for the young master of Dongli everywhere. ”
