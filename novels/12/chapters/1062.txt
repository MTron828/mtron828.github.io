An Lizi couldn’t wait to open the takeout and place it on the table. “Pingting! Come over and eat!”

“Coming!”

The three of them gathered around the table and ate.

The aroma of the food filled the entire room.

“After eating, an lizi cleaned up the rubbish and was about to send it downstairs. Just as she was about to leave, she saw Mother Zhao and Zhao Yingjun hurriedly walking towards the ward. ”

“Auntie! Brother Yingjun!”

“Lizi!”Mother Zhao jogged over when she saw an Lizi. “Lizi! Where’s Pingting? Is Pingting Alright?”

“”She’s fine, she’s fine. Don’t worry, Auntie! Pingting is fine. Follow me quickly!” ”

Mother Zhao and Zhao Yingjun heaved a sigh of relief when they heard that Zhao Pingting was fine.

“An Lizi brought the two of them to the ward. “Pingting, Look Who’s Here!” ”

“Zhao Pingting raised her head and saw two familiar voices. Her eyes instantly turned red. “Mom, Brother!”When she was locked in the basement, Zhao Pingting had thought that she wouldn’t be able to live, she would never see her parents and family again. Now that she saw Mother Zhao and Zhao Yingjun again, Zhao Pingting felt a sense of sadness. ”

“She was so close, so close that she wouldn’t be able to see them. ”

“Pingting!”Mother Zhao and Yingjun ran over and hugged her.

“When she heard the police say that Zhao Pingting’s disappearance might be related to the two recent serial murders in Beijing, mother Zhao felt as if she had died. She was really afraid that she would never see Zhao Pingting again. ”

“To be able to hug the living Zhao pingting like this, mother Zhao felt as if she was dreaming. ”

“”Mom, Brother!”Zhao Pingting cried bitterly. “I thought I would never see you guys again...” ”

“”Silly child, what nonsense are you talking about!” ”

The scene was especially moving. An Lizi couldn’t help but tear up when she saw this scene.

“After a while, the three of them gradually calmed down. Zhao pingting continued, “Mom, Where’s Dad?” ”

“Zhao Yingjun said, “Dad’s heart has been bad recently. Mom and I didn’t dare to tell him about this! He’s still in the Dark!” ”

“Hearing this, Zhao Pingting asked nervously, “Is dad okay?” ”

Zhao wiped her tears. “Your dad is fine. You Don’t have to worry!”

“After saying that, Zhao walked to ye Zao’s side and held his hands, she said with a stiff voice, “Zao Zao, I heard from the police that you were the first to notice Pingting’s disappearance. You were also the first to call the police. You were also the one who found the murderer’s hiding place. Zao Zao, Thank You! “You saved Pingting twice. I have no way to repay you. I will kneel down for You!” ”

“The murderer had already killed two people. If it wasn’t for Ye Zhuozhuo, she wouldn’t have been able to see such a complete an Lizi. ”

Not to mention kneeling down.

“Even if mother Zhao had to give her life to Ye Zhuozhuo, she would still be willing. ” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Ye Zhuozhuo quickly helped mother Zhao up. “Aunt, you’re exaggerating! Not to mention that Pingting is my best friend, even if Pingting isn’t my friend, I won’t stand idly by when I see such a thing!” ”

“Mother Zhao hugged ye Zhuoyin and said in a raspy voice, “Zhuoyin, thank you! You Didn’t save Pingting alone, but our entire family!” ”

...

On the other side.

Zhao Xueyin had already stayed in the capital for more than a week.

“During this period of time, Zhao Xueyin had pretty much figured out ye Zhuoyin’s situation. ”

The most important thing now was to get close to Ye Zhuoyin.

Yes.

“She had to get close to Ye Zao, Gain Ye Zao’s Trust, and become his best friend. ”

She had to make ye Zao admit his defeat wholeheartedly!

Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes and had a plan in her heart.

“The next day, ye Zao went to the hospital to see Zhao Pingting as usual. ”

“Today was Sunday, and there were many patients in the hospital. In a hurry, Ye Zao was bumped by someone. ”

“”I’m sorry, I’m sorry. Are you okay? I didn’t do it on purpose!”The person who bumped into ye Zao quickly apologized to Ye Zao. ”

Ye Zao looked down and saw that the person who bumped into her was about twenty-five or twenty-six years old. She was pretty and had an extraordinary temperament. It was obvious that she came from an extraordinary background.

“While she was sizing up the other person, the other person was also sizing her up. ”

“Zhao Xueyin looked at ye Zao, and there was an obvious flash of surprise in her eyes. ”

“Most of the time, the image of a celebrity on television was much more beautiful than in real life. After all, the television had filters and beautiful faces. However, she did not expect that the person in front of her was actually more beautiful than on television! ”

Zhao Xueyin was a rare beauty to begin with. There were very few girls who would be amazed after seeing her.

Ye Zao was the first.

“Not only was she beautiful, but she was also full of talent. She was only twenty years old and already had a phd in science and technology. ”

“Unfortunately, she was a girl. ”

“If she were a man, she would definitely have great achievements! ”

“Thinking of this, a regretful look flashed across Zhao Xueyin’s eyes. ”

“Zhao Xueyin concealed the expression in her eyes and continued, “I really didn’t do it on purpose! Are You Alright?”Her attitude was very sincere, making it impossible for anyone to find anything wrong with her. ”

“Ye Zao smiled slightly. “I’m fine.”After saying that, he turned around and left. ”

Zhao Xueyin looked at ye Zao’s back and narrowed her eyes slightly. Ye Zao was much closer to her than she had imagined.

It seemed that it was only a matter of time before she became good friends with Ye Zao.

“At this moment, Zhao Xueyin’s phone rang. ”

Zhao Xueyin picked up her phone and went to the inpatient department.

“In the evening, ye Zao went downstairs to buy food. ”

Zhao Xueyin followed ye Zao neither too far nor too close.

She followed him all the way to Yueyang Building.

“Seeing ye Zao’s figure disappear into Yueyang building, Zhao Xueyin’s lips curled up. ”

“She had followed ye Zhuo for such a long distance, yet ye Zhuo had not even noticed her. It was obvious how stupid ye Zhuo was! ”

“If it was someone who was slightly more vigilant, they would have probably discovered her just by walking. ”

Zhao Xueyin raised her hand to tidy her hair and also walked into Yueyang building. She deliberately walked to ye Zhuo’s side and pretended to be very surprised. “Aren’t you the young lady from this morning? You also came here to buy food?”

“Ye Zhuo did not seem to recognize her. “I’m sorry, but you are?” ”

“Zhao Xueyin continued, “I’m the girl who accidentally stepped on your shoes in the hospital lobby this morning! Do you still remember her?” ”

“Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and said with a smile, “So it’s you.” ”

“”Yes, yes, yes, it’s me!”Zhao Xueyin continued, “Young Lady, do you have a friend who lives in the hospital too?” ”

“Yes.”

“Zhao Xueyin said, “I have a friend staying in the hospital too! I’m here to buy food for her. She loves to eat the food at Yueyang restaurant the most!” ”

Ye Zao’s eyebrows remained the same. “My friend also likes the food at Yueyang restaurant.”

“”Really?”Zhao Xueyin said in surprise, “Then we are really fated! Little Sister, let’s add each other on wechat?” ”

“Sure.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and took out his phone. “Shall I scan you?”

Zhao Xueyin did not expect to be able to add ye Zhuo’s wechat so smoothly. She immediately adjusted the phone page to the QR code page. “Sure!”

Di!

Ye Zhuo put away his phone. “I added it. Take a look.”

Zhao Xueyin accepted the friend request. “My surname is Zhao. My name is Zhao Xueyin. I’m Zhao Zilong’s Zhao. I’m Snowflake’s snow. I’m singing. What About You?”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Your name is very nice. I Am Ye Zao.” ”

“”Run away and burn the flower. Your name is also nice,”Zhao Xueyin said. ”
