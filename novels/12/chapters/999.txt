Dr. YC!

Professor Yue and Tang Xue didn’t expect Ye Zhuo to be Dr. YC!

“Dr. Carroll, Dr. Charlie, and Dr. Barney who won the Science and Technology Competition! ”

“As everyone knew, country P was the country with the most advanced technology. Therefore, the top three winners of the annual science and Technology Conference were almost all taken by these three people. ”

“However, at last year’s science and Technology Conference, Dr. YC shocked the entire science and technology industry and directly crushed the three giants of country P. ”

He became the Dark Horse of the industry!

It made all the science and technology people go crazy.

Even Professor Yue was a fan of Dr. YC.

Her only regret in life was that she did not participate in the science and technology competition that day to see Dr. YC’s grace.

But she did not expect that Ye Zhuo was actually Dr. YC.

Oh My God.

What did she do in front of Ye Zhuo these days?

She remembered what she had done in the past few days.

Professor Yue was stunned on the spot.

“He could not react for a long time, and his heart was very confused. ”

Tang Xue’s mood was also very complicated.

She had thought that ye Zhuo’s most powerful identity was Cen Shaoqing’s girlfriend.

She did not expect that she was actually Dr. YC.

“Dr. YCD, who stood at the top of the scientific and technological world! ”

“At this moment, a low voice suddenly appeared in the air, “Professor Yue, where is Zao Zao?” ”

Professor Yue came to his senses at this moment and turned back to look.

He saw a slender figure appear behind him.

His facial features were cold and handsome. He wore a plain robe and held a string of bright red Buddhist beads in his hand.

“The skeleton of a foreigner was bigger than that of a Chinese person, and he was much taller than a Chinese person. However, standing here, not only was he not shorter than a group of foreigners, he was even taller. ”

“In the crowded exhibition hall, he stood out like a crane among chickens! ”

“It was clearly a very casual posture, but it exploded with a powerful aura. ”

It was beyond the reach of others!

“Professor Yue was stunned at first, then he said, “Fifth Master, you’re back! Miss ye was called over by the director and Dr. Alva.” ”

“I got it.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and walked inside.

“Fifth Master!”

Professor Yue called out to Cen Shaoqing’s back. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Speak.”Cen Shaoqing said concisely.

“Professor Yue gulped and continued, “Fifth Master, Miss Ye, Miss Ye is Dr. y, YC?” ”

“How did you know?”Ye Zhuo had always kept a low profile and almost never took the initiative to talk about these things.

Even Cen Shaoqing only knew that she was from YC because he gave her an award.

It really was.

Ye Zao really was.

Professor Yue nodded with difficulty. “I just heard Dr. Alva and the director call her that.”

“Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “That’s right, she is Dr. YC.” ”

“CEN Fifth Master!”

“Fifth Master!”

“At this moment, many big shots of science and technology saw CEN Shaoqing and took the initiative to come over to greet him. ”

Professor Yue stood rooted to the ground.

“His face alternated between green and white, looking very ugly. ”

Ye Zao was Dr. YC.

No Wonder Ye Zao was so powerful.

No Wonder Ye Zao could easily fix the flaws in the design drawings.

It was all her fault for judging the heart of a gentleman with a petty heart.

“Thinking of her words and deeds these days, professor Yue wished he could slap that stupid himself to death. ”

“Professor Yue lowered his head and looked at Tang Xue. “Xiaoxue, in a while, we’ll go apologize to Miss Ye.” ”

Tang Xue had mixed feelings in her heart. She felt so uncomfortable that she could hardly breathe.

She always felt that she was comparable to ye Zao.

“But now, Ye Zao was actually Dr. YC! ”

Then how could she compete with ye Zao?

What right did she have to compete with ye Zao?

“After greeting everyone, cen Shaoqing walked towards the VIP room. ”

“Through the glass door, one could see ye Zao standing in front of the rectangular conference table and saying something. ”

There were many bigwigs from various countries sitting at the conference table.

“The bigwigs who could usually make the scientific and technological world tremble with a stomp of their feet were now like primary school students, obediently sitting in front of the table and taking notes, afraid of accidentally missing out on something. ”

“If they hadn’t seen it with their own eyes, no one would believe that it was real. ”

“”Master Five, are you still going in?”Seeing Cen Shaoqing standing there, the person in charge at the side asked. ”

Cen Shaoqing raised his hand slightly. “I’ll wait here for a while.”

“Okay.”The person in charge nodded.

He sighed in his heart. This Dr. YC was really amazing. He actually made CEN fifth master wait outside willingly.

The glass in the meeting room was made of a special material.

“From the outside, one could see the inside, but the people inside could not see the outside. ”

“After about an hour, the door of the meeting room was opened. ”

A group of people walked out.

“Cen Shaoqing had been running outside for two days and had not slept for two days. At this moment, he was resting on the sofa with one hand on his head. ”
