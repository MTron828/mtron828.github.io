Now was a good opportunity.

“”What are you talking about, Tang Xue!”Tang Mi was very angry. “I really didn’t expect you to be such a person!” ”

Make Xiao Qing kneel to Tang?

It was fortunate that Tang Xue could say such a thing!

“”At a time like this, you’re still thinking about your integrity? “How much is your integrity worth?”Tang Xue continued, “I advise you to seize this opportunity and miss it. Even if your mother kneels in front of my mother for three days and three nights, I won’t Forgive You!” ”

Tang mi couldn’t be bothered with Tang Xue anymore. She turned around and walked inside.

“Tang Xue looked at Tang Mi’s back and said, “Tang Mi, don’t regret it!” ”

Tang Mi came to the preparation cabin.

“Seeing Tang Mi come in, Cen Hu immediately stood up. “Tang Mi!” ”

“Tang mi smiled and said, “Great Lake, what happened to you?” ”

“Cen Hu said aggrievedly, “Just now, Tang Xue Came. She said that Miss Ye is a liar! Miss Ye abandoned all of us and ran away! Miss Ye won’t run away, right? Miss Ye won’t lie to us, right?” ”

Tang mi nodded. “Of course Miss Ye won’t lie to us! Have you forgotten what Miss Ye told us last night? Hurry up and start preparing. Don’t Pull Miss Ye’s crotch.”

“Hearing that, Cen Hu instantly found confidence. He smiled and said, “Right! Miss Ye won’t lie to us.” ”

“”Great Lake, why are you acting like a fool!”Cen he said somewhat speechlessly. ”

Cen Hu wiped his tears. “You’re the Fool!”

“CEN he said speechlessly, “Look at your silly face! Other people only said a few words to sow discord, and you’re still crying!” ”

“”I don’t have any culture, I don’t know what it means to sow discord!”Cen Hu was very talented in science and technology, but his culture was indeed not deep. ”

On the other side.

“Dr. Millet, Dr. Warne, and the Flying Space Team were having a meeting in the office. Just in case the aircraft carrier encountered any problems during the lift-off, they had to take immediate measures. ”

“Chen Hao said excitedly, “I’ve participated in the launch of rockets and spaceships, but this is my first time participating in the lift-off ceremony of an aircraft carrier!” ”

“Dr. Millet smiled and said, “Let’s talk about you. Isn’t it the first time for all of us here?” ”

“After saying that, dr. millet continued, “I hope the aircraft carrier can successfully lift off and land on Neptune.” ”

The first plan after the aircraft carrier’s lift-off was to land on Neptune.

“Neptune was 4.5 billion kilometers away from Earth. According to the schedule, it would take four hours to travel to Neptune at the speed of light! ” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“What Millet was worried about now was not whether the aircraft carrier could take off, but whether the aircraft carrier could land on Neptune within four hours. ”

“After All, Neptune was the furthest planet from Earth. ”

“Because it was too far away from Earth, humans knew very little about Neptune. ”

Dr. Millet was still worried that the aircraft carrier would encounter other problems after landing on Neptune.

What if something unexpected happened?

“Neptune was 4.5 billion kilometers away from Earth. If something happened to the aircraft carrier on Neptune, they would have no choice but to panic on Earth. ”

“”Don’t worry. With burning father around, there will definitely be no problems.”Chen Hao was ye Zao’s biggest fan! He trusted ye Zao very much. Even if everyone said that ye Zao had run away, he still firmly believed that ye Zao had not run away. ”

Because ye Zao was not that kind of person.

“If ye Zao wanted to run away, he would not have waited until now. ”

“Dr. Warne handed a piece of paper to Dr. Millet, then he said, “I will board the aircraft carrier with Miss Ye. I’ll leave this side to you. If anything happens, immediately activate the emergency cabin. No matter what Miss Ye says, you have to save Miss Ye First!” ”

Even though Dr. Warne also trusted ye Zao very much.

“However, the aircraft carrier was going to fly out of Earth after all. Who knew what kind of danger they would encounter in outer space. ”

“China could lose him, but China could not lose ye Zao! ”

“Millet looked at Dr. Warne, and her voice suddenly became a little choked up. “Dr. Warne, you...” ”

“Remember to do as I say.”Dr. Warne patted Millet’s shoulder.

Millet nodded.

“Chen Hao continued, “And me, Dr. Warne. I’ll go up with you.” ”

“The two members of the Feiyu team lost their composure. They immediately looked up at Chen Hao and said, “Captain!” ”

“Chen Hao smiled and said, “It’s my honor to be able to go to Neptune with Father Ye.” ”

“After saying that, Chen Hao looked at Sun Tian and said with a cheeky smile, “Little Sweetie, if anything happens to me, I’ll leave the Feiyu team to you.” ”

“Sun Tian said with a firm gaze, “Captain, I believe in Miss Ye just like you! I also believe in the research community of China!” ”
