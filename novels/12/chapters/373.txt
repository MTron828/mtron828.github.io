Was it to humiliate her?

Slut!

Ye Zao was a slut!

“”Miss YR, long time no see.”Ye Zao smiled as Mu Yourong extended her hand. ”

“Although ye Zao was smiling, Mu Yourong could see the thick mockery in that smile. ”

Yes!

Mockery!

“But at that moment, Mu Yourong had no choice but to reach out and hold ye Zao’s hand, trying her best to squeeze out a smile. “Long time no see.” ”

Ye Zao very quickly let go of Mu Yourong’s hand.

“Although it was only for a short moment, Mu Yourong felt a fierce pain coming from her wrist. ”

It was as if something had been stripped out of her body.

The pain was excruciating.

“But in the next second, he could not feel anything. ”

It was as if that moment just now was an illusion.

Was it an illusion?

Mu Yourong was not sure either.

“At this moment, three blond-haired and blue-eyed people from country P walked over. ”

“Chu Zimo immediately stood up and greeted, “Dr. Carroll, Dr. Charlie, Dr. Barney.” ”

These three people were the three giants of Country P.

They held supreme status in the scientific and technological world!

“In all the previous scientific and technological conferences, the top three winners were almost all taken by these three people. ”

Therefore.

Country P was also known as a scientific and technological country by the other countries!

“However, all of this would be overturned starting from tonight. ”

Chu Zimo had been displeased with the three of them for a long time!

“When he thought of the upcoming competition, Chu Zimo was very excited. ”

The three magnates of country P had always been high and mighty in front of China.

It had been more than ten years!

Even China had been crushed by them.

They had been the fourth in ten thousand years.

Their ranking had never been in the top three.

“Carol took a few steps forward and looked at ye Zao with disdain. “I heard from Dr. Warne that China has injected quite a lot of new blood this year. I believe that this person must have made a significant contribution to the scientific and technological world, right?” ”

“Ye Zao looked up slightly, his eyes sparkling. “I can’t say that he has made a significant contribution, but he has made a small contribution.” ”

Neither servile nor overbearing.

He displayed the demeanor of a big country to the fullest.

Carol narrowed his eyes and looked down at the nameplate on ye Zao’s table. “You Are Nehulu YC?”

“I am.”

The name Nehulu YC could be seen on the science and technology website almost every day.

This person became famous in one battle.

His strength was especially high.

Unfortunately.

According to his investigation.

This was a team of a thousand people operating this account.

She was not an independent individual at all.

“Thinking of this, the disdain on Carol’s face became even more obvious. A cheater dared to attend the science and Technology Conference? ”

“”I can often see your name on the science and Technology website.”Carol looked at ye Zhuo and continued, “I wonder if I can have the honor of competing with you on the same stage today?” ”

“Of course.”Ye Zao nodded.

As soon as he said that.

The Forum on the technology website was in an uproar again.

[ he accepted the challenge! Daddy accepted the Challenge! ]

[ Ah Ah Ah! I’m so excited! ]

[ Daddy is Awesome! ]

[ daddy is so cool! ]

“[ I’ve loved Daddy for 10,000 years! ] ”

-LSB- daThistYCs YC is a little touHe! he doesn’t look like a team dog. ]

“[ who doesn’t know how to do superficial work? If you lose, just cry! ] ”

[ Haha! Are You a cry monster? ]

Someone immediately posted a vote on the forum.

They were betting on whether ye Zao could enter the top three.

“Currently, there were 2,000 people supporting ye Zao. ”

There were more than 500 people supporting the three magnates of Country P.

At the science and Technology Conference.

The person in charge would give each participant a number plate.

Mu Yourong also signed up for the competition.

“Since she had come, she did not intend to leave empty-handed! ”

She had to win against Ye Zao and win back all the humiliation she had just suffered.

She wanted to stomp ye Zao under her feet.

“”System, is there a way to win against ye Zao?” ”

The system did not immediately respond to her like it usually did.

“Mu yourong frowned and asked, “System, are you there?” ”

The system still did not reply.

What was going on?

“At this moment, the person in charge had already handed the number plate to MU yourong. ”

Mu Yourong took the number plate with a natural expression.

But her heart was in a mess!

“At this critical moment, what had happened to the system! ”

“System!”

“System!”

“No matter how much Mu Yourong shouted in her heart, the system still did not make a single sound. ”

“At this moment, the match had already begun. ”

The contestants from various countries walked onto the stage.

Mu Yourong walked onto the stage very nervously.

She was praying in her heart for the system to hurry back.

“System!”

“But there was no response. Mu Yourong walked all the way to her position, but the system did not respond at all. ”
