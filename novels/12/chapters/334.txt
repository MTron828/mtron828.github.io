Translator: 549690339

“Check up on me?”Ye Sen looked at Bai Wei curiously.

“Bai Wei explained, “Although my parents aren’t in Yun Jing, my family’s upbringing is especially strict. Every night after 10:30, they’ll send a video to see if I’m at home.” ”

Ye Sen nodded to show that he understood. “Then let’s go back quickly.”

Ye Sen drove Bai Wei back.

Bai Wei lived in a high-end neighborhood.

“Soon, they arrived at their destination. ”

“I’ll go back first.”Bai Wei got out of the car with the Roses in her hands. “Drive slowly on the road.”

“”I will.”Ye Sen looked at Bai Wei’s back and suddenly thought of something. He continued, “Bai Wei, wait a moment.” ”

“Is there anything else?”Bai Wei turned around in confusion.

“Ye Sen took out the jewelry box. “Bai Wei, put this on.” ”

Bai Wei smiled and pulled out the necklace around her neck. “I already have this.”

“”But this was meant for you. If you don’t want it, what should I do with it?”Ye Sen said. ”

Bai Wei thought for a moment. “Give it to your sister. She’s more suitable than me.”

“Ye Sen smiled and got out of the car. “She’ll be your sister in the future.”After saying that, he stuffed the necklace into Bai Wei’s hands. “What’s given to You is yours. If you don’t want it, throw it in the trash can.” ”

“”Alright, I’ll go back first. Good night.” ”

“Bai Wei knew that she couldn’t refuse, so she didn’t refuse. “Good night.” ”

Ye Sen drove away.

“Seeing ye Sen’s car leave, Bai Wei put down the disguise on her face and turned around to walk to the other side. ”

“She didn’t live in this upscale neighborhood at all, but in an ordinary neighborhood nearby. ”

Bai Wei now lived with Li Yiyi.

“When she went back, Li Yiyi was sitting in the living room watching TV. ”

“Sister Yiyi.”

“Li Yiyi turned her head and saw Bai Wei walking in with a rose in her hand. She was stunned, but she immediately reacted. “Ye Sen confessed to you?” ”

Bai Wei was indeed a formidable person.

The speed of her development was faster than she had imagined.

“Yes.”Bai Wei nodded.

A hint of jealousy flashed across Li Yiyi’s eyes. It was fleeting.

Yes.

How could she not be jealous?

Ye Sen was her boyfriend in the past after all.

But so what if she was jealous?

“Bai Wei smiled and walked to Li Yiyi’s side. “Sister Yiyi, look. This is the necklace ye Sen gave me. I’m giving it to you now.” ”

This could be considered as comforting.

Bai Wei knew the logic of a dead lip and a cold tooth.

Li Yiyi was unhappy.

Then her good days would come to an end.

“Li Yiyi asked doubtfully, “Giving it to me?” ”

“Bai Wei nodded. “Yes, giving it to you! Sister Yiyi, everything that I have now is given to me by you. If I don’t give it to you, who else can I give it to? We agreed to share happiness together. This necklace is just the beginning.” ”

“But this is something ye Sen gave you. What if Ye Sen asks about it?”Li Yiyi said.

“Bai Wei pulled out the necklace around her neck. “I’ll wear this one.”Anyway, she was a simple person. Wearing such an expensive necklace would ruin her character. ”

Li Yiyi narrowed her eyes. “I don’t think the quality of your necklace is very good.”

“Bai Wei smiled and said, “Sister Yiyi has good taste. I bought this necklace from a street stall. Although it’s uncomfortable to wear, I think ye Sen likes it.” ”

“Li Yiyi was not an idiot. She immediately understood the trick and took the jewelry box from Bai Wei. “In that case, I won’t stand on ceremony with you.” ”

Every woman pursued big brands.

Li Yiyi had liked this brand of necklaces for a long time.

Bai Wei put the Roses aside. “No need to stand on ceremony. What’s mine from now on is yours.”

“Compared to Ye Sen’s wealth, a ten-thousand-yuan necklace was nothing? ”

Bai Wei really did not care. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Li Yiyi took the necklace and was in a better mood. “Did ye Sen say when he would bring you to meet his parents?”

“Bai Wei shook her head. “He didn’t say when exactly, but he has a very good impression of me. I think it will only happen during this period of time.” ”

“”Remember to perform well when the time comes,”Li Yiyi reminded. ”

“”Don’t worry.”Bai Wei smiled and said, “I know what to do.” ”

“Li Yiyi nodded, and a calculative look flashed in her eyes. “That’s good.” ”

...

On the other side.

“Ye Sen was in high spirits at happy events. On the way home, he even bought a fried chicken and iced coke. ”

Ye Shu happened to come back from the restaurant and bumped into Ye Sen at the entrance of the apartment building.

“Sis!”Ye Sen hummed a little tune to greet her.

Ye Shu saw the smile in Ye Sen’s eyes. “What Good Thing Happened?”
