“Chapter 337: 108: head to Yunjing, meet the mother and son, and bump into Bai Wei’s true face! 4”

“Ye Sen liked Bai Wei very much, and had never doubted Bai Wei, “Sister, zhuoluo, I can assure you that Bai Wei is not that kind of material girl. She doesn’t want money, she doesn’t want money! I know it’s useless to say anything now. When you meet her, you’ll know that I’m not lying.” ”

“Since Bai Wei could live in a high-end residential area, it meant that she did not lack money at all. ”

“Since she did not lack money, why would she need money? ”

“Ye Zhuo was quite curious about Bai Wei. He raised his eyebrows slightly. “Uncle, when are you going to bring her back for us to see?” ”

“Ye Sen smiled and said, “Since you want to see your future aunt so much, I’ll find a time to bring her back for you to see.” ”

...

Beijing.

The summer vacation was already halfway over.

Lin Ze knew that he couldn’t wait any longer.

He had to make another trip to Yun Jing!

Lin Ze carried the pastries that he had personally made to old Mrs. Lin’s room. “Grandma.”

“Ah Ze is here.”Old Mrs. Lin sat up from the bed.

“The weather in Beijing had been bad recently. Her rheumatism had been acting up, and she felt uncomfortable all over. ”

“Lin Ze walked to the bedside and sat down. He handed the pastry to old Mrs. Lin. “Grandma, this is my first time learning how to make pastries. Please try it. I know you have bad teeth, so I specially made it soft.” ”

“In order to make old Mrs. Lin Happy, not only did she have to know how to say nice things, but she also had to know how to do nice things. ”

“Old Mrs. Lin smiled and picked up a piece of pastry. She smiled and said, “As long as it’s made by Ah Ze, I like to eat it.” ”

“When the pastry entered her mouth, it was soft and melted immediately. The taste was very good. ”

“From this, it could be seen that Lin Ze had also spent a lot of effort on the pastry. ”

Old Mrs. Lin was full of praise.

“Lin Ze considered his words in his heart. Instead of sneaking off to cloud capital, he might as well tell old Mrs. Lin openly, “Grandma, Mozzie, Fat Tiger, and dog two are going to form a group to go to cloud capital to play. I want to go too.” ”

Yun Jing?

“Old Lady Lin frowned and her expression instantly turned ugly. She immediately put down the pastry in her hand and asked, “What are you going to Yun Jing for?” ”

“Lin Ze was stunned and said somewhat at a loss, “Did I make you angry in some way? Or is there a problem with going to Yun Jing?” ”

Only then did Old Lady Lin realize that her reaction was a little too extreme.

“After all, Lin Ze still did not know anything. ”

“Thinking of this, Old Madam Lin’s expression eased up a little. She continued, “Yun Jing is a poor place with no birds in the sky. It’s not even half the size of our capital! What’s there to be fun about?” ”

Unruly people came out of the mountains and rivers.

Ye Shu was one of them.

“Lin Ze continued, “Actually, the fairy peak in Yun Jing is quite fun! “Unfortunately, I only played half of it last time. Oh right, grandma, I also heard that there is a very effective temple in Yunjing. Your Health is not good, so I want to go to that temple and burn some incense so that the bodhisattva can bless your health and live a long life! “Mozzie, fat tiger, and buttface are all going to burn incense and pray for their grandma! “Other grandmas have some, but my grandma must have some too!” ”

“Hearing this, Old Mrs. Lin was extremely touched. ”

So the child wanted to be filial to her.

“When one was old, they wanted to see the younger generation be filial to them the most. ”

“”Grandma, I’ve Never Done Anything for you in my entire life. Please let me go!” ”

Old Mrs. Lin looked at Lin Ze. “How many days are you guys going to spend there?” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“”About ten days,”Lin ze replied. ”

“Ten days is that long?”Old Mrs. Lin frowned.

“Lin Ze continued, “There are many tourist attractions in Yun Jing that are worth checking out. Ten Days isn’t much. Grandma, I Know You’re worried about me! But I’m not a child anymore. I can take care of myself!” ”

Old Mrs. Lin hesitated for a moment.

“She was afraid that Lin Ze would run into ye Shu in Yun Jing, and she was also afraid that if she didn’t agree to Lin Ze’s request, Lin Ze would let his imagination run wild. ”

It had already been so many years. Perhaps ye Shu was no longer in the cloud capital?

“Besides, the mother and son had never seen each other before. Even if they did run into each other, they might not be able to recognize each other. ”

It was not a big deal to keep holding Lin ze back and not letting him go to the cloud capital.

Old Mrs. Lin narrowed her eyes and a calculative look appeared in her eyes. “Then go ahead. I’ll get the housekeeper to pack up some things for you later.”

“After saying that, old Mrs. Lin continued, “That dog two, if it can be broken, it should be broken! He and you are not from the same world.” ”

“A flash of displeasure flashed through Lin Ze’s eyes, but he did not show it. He only said, “Grandma, dog two got second place in the college entrance exam in the capital.” ”
