He didn’t even call Chen Siyao by her name anymore. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“If it wasn’t for their past relationship, he would have already thrown her out! ”

“But Old Master Chen didn’t see song Shiyu’s emotions. He continued, “Shiyu, a man should have a family. Getting married early or late means getting married!” ”

“You and Yaoyao grew up together. You know each other very well. There’s nothing out of the ordinary about you.”

Song Shiyu was just being polite and giving old master Chen a way out.

“After all, Chen Siyao was a girl, and Old Master Chen was an elder. ”

“”Old Master Chen, I’m really sorry,”song Shiyu said slowly. “Miss Chen and I are really not suitable for each other.” ”

“”Not suitable? What do you think is wrong with the two of you?”Old Master Chen continued, “I think the two of you are very suitable!” ”

“They understood each other, and Chen Siyao liked him so much that she would even kneel down to him for song Shiyu. There was no other girl in this world who was so infatuated with him. ”

“”I believe that Miss Chen will definitely be able to find her ideal husband,”song Shiyu continued. ”

“This time, Old Master Chen finally understood what song Shiyu meant. ”

So it was song Shiyu who didn’t like Chen Siyao.

“Thinking of this, Old Master Chen’s eyes turned slightly red, he continued, “Shiyu, you know me. I didn’t want to put on this old face, but Yaoyao is my only granddaughter. That Child Yaoyao really likes you. For You, she’s willing to do anything! Just take it as me begging you once, okay?” ”

Old Master Chen was really going all out if he could do it to the extent that it was worth it!

It had always been a family where there were hundreds of families begging for a daughter.

Who would need a grandfather like him to beg for a daughter like him!

But what could he do?

“After all, he was Chen Siyao’s only grandfather. ”

“”Old Master Chen.”Song Shiyu never expected old master Chen to say something like this after he rejected old master Chen, “Marriage is not a game. Since I have decided who I want to marry, I must be responsible for her for the rest of my life. However, Miss Chen is not the person I want to be responsible for.” ”

Elder Chen did not expect song Shiyu to say such a thing.

He also did not expect song Shiyu to reject him!

Could it be that song Shiyu had forgotten about what happened back then?

Or did song Shiyu think that he was not important enough to come personally to propose a marriage?

“After all, Song Shiyu used to always give him whatever he wanted. ”

“”Shiyu, I’ve watched you grow up. I trust your character, so I can trust you with Yaoyao!”Grandfather Chen said. ”

Song Shiyu massaged his temples with a headache.

He realized that the Chen family had a unique characteristic.

They liked to pester.

“He had repeated the same sentence many times, but grandfather Chen and Chen Siyao just couldn’t understand it. ”

“”Old Master Chen, I already have someone I like.”Song Shiyu went straight to the point. ”

Someone I like?

“Old Master Chen nodded. “I know that. Yaoyao told me, and she also said that she doesn’t mind this matter.” ”

“After saying that.., old Master Chen smiled and said, “We’re all men. I know what you’re thinking. Who Didn’t have a crush on someone when they were young? “To be honest, before I got together with your grandmother, there was a girl that I liked very much.” ”

“As a man, who didn’t have a past? ”

This was very normal!

Grandfather Chen understood song Shiyu very well.

“”As long as you treat Yaoyao well after marriage and don’t bully her, I can pretend that I never knew about this.” ”

“Grandfather Chen was a very open-minded parent. If Chen Siyao didn’t mind that song Shiyu had a girl that he liked, why would he care so much? ”

“Song Shiyu turned to look at old master Chen and continued, “Old Master Chen, Miss Chen and I aren’t suitable for each other.” ”

“”Yes, we are! I’ve found someone to look at the eight characters. The two of you are very suitable for each other!”Old Master Chen said with a smile. ”

Song Shiyu furrowed his brows without a trace.

“Seeing song Shiyu like this.., old Master Chen continued, “Shiyu, do you still remember the first time you saw me? “You mistook me for your grandfather. It snowed heavily that night. When your father came to look for you the next day, he thought that something had happened to you in the snow!” ”

“It was a snowy night with a temperature OF-10 degrees Celsius. If Old Master Chen had not brought little song Shiyu back, Song Shiyu would have frozen to death long ago! ”

“But now, he had made such a small request, and song Shiyu could not even agree to it! ”

This was a little too much!

“Moreover, this matter didn’t do song Shiyu any harm at all! ”

“At the mention of that year, a complicated expression flashed across song Shiyu’s face. All these years, if the Chen Corporation needed help with anything, Old Master Chen would always say the same thing! ”
