It was very obvious.

This was a warning from CEN Shaoqing.

Who would dare to disobey CEN fifth master’s Words?

Li Qiandong was so angry that he wanted to smash his phone.

The Mu family.

Big Soldier Mu had been waiting for the news of Li Qiandong taking a stake.

“But after waiting for a long time, he still did not receive it. ”

“Seeing that the company was on the verge of collapse and that the local tax bureau had been exerting pressure, big soldier mu called Mu Yourong again. ”

“Mu Yourong comforted soldier Mu. “Dad, don’t worry. Since Li Qiandong promised me, he won’t go back on his word! Perhaps he’s already making arrangements!” ” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Hearing this, soldier Mu’s heart calmed down a little. ”

“At this moment, someone knocked on the office door. ”

“Soldier mu said, “Come in!” ”

A few shareholders walked in from outside.

“”Old Mu, the company is on the verge of bankruptcy now! The stock has dropped by 10 points. If this continues, you should be very clear about the consequences!” ”

Big Soldier Mu frowned. “So What do you want?”

“”Now that someone is willing to buy the company, a few of our shareholders have discussed it and decided to sell the company!” ”

“”Impossible!”Big Soldier Mu said with a straight face, “All of you are old people in the company! All these years, what kind of hardships have we not experienced? Don’t tell me that even you are going to add insult to injury now?” ”

Sell the company?

“With the current situation, even if they really sold the company, they would not be able to fill up the mess. ”

The few shareholders did not say anything.

“Big soldier mu continued, “I’ll tell you the truth! The Li Group will soon take a stake in our MU group! At that time, the MU group will usher in a new glory!” ”

“Hearing this, the few shareholders looked at each other and did not doubt big soldier Mu’s words. ”

“After all, the MU group’s previous crisis was solved by the Li Group. ”

“”Old Mu, with your words, we can be at ease! When is the Li Group going to take a stake?” ”

“”It’s already being arranged,”answered big soldier Mu. ”

“Hearing this, the huge stone in the hearts of the shareholders was finally lifted, and they no longer mentioned the matter of selling the company. ”

“In the blink of an eye, it was evening. ”

But there was still no news of the Li Corporation investing.

“This time, big soldier Mu couldn’t sit still any longer and immediately drove home. ”

“When Mu Yourong heard about this matter, she frowned slightly and was also somewhat uneasy. ”

“It had already been a day, so how could there be no reaction from Li Qiandong’s side? ”

“”Father, don’t be anxious. I’ll go and contact Li Qiandong right away.” ”

“After saying this, Mu Yourong hurriedly contacted Li Qiandong. ”

“On the other end of the phone, Li Qiandong said very apologetically, “Yourong, I’m sorry... My Father has revoked my position! But don’t worry, I’ll definitely think of a way to help you!” ”

Mu Yourong’s face instantly turned white.

She had never imagined that things would turn out like this.

Right at this moment.

The door to the MU residence was pushed open.

“A few people dressed in uniforms filed in. “Soldier Mu, is it? You’re suspected of tax evasion and bribery! Please come with us!” ”

“Before soldier Mu could react, his hands were handcuffed with ice-cold handcuffs. ”

“Dad!”Mu Yourong stood in front of Soldier Mu.

“Please don’t interfere with official business!”A few law enforcement officers pulled mu yourong away.

Soldier Mu was taken away just like that.

The MU group fell very quickly.

“The next day, it was declared bankrupt, and it was in debt of two billion! ”

The Court froze the accounts of everyone in the Mu family and sealed off the MU family’s villa.

Mu Yourong and Shen Rong were forced to move out of the villa.

They had no choice but to move to a dirty and run-down neighborhood.

“Li Qiandong drove over to help and looked at Mu Yourong guiltily. “Yourong, why don’t you and Auntie move to my place temporarily?”With the accounts frozen, Li Qiandong was currently unable to help Mu Yourong. ”

“Mu Yourong pretended to shake her head firmly and said with reddened eyes, “Big Brother Li, I appreciate your kindness! But there’s no need!” ”

What if Fifth Master Cen was testing her?

“If she really moved to Li Qiandong’s place, fifth master Cen would definitely have an opinion. ”

“Li Qiandong sighed in his heart that Mu Yourong was really a good girl. She was already like this, yet she was still so strong. She was not willing to accept his help. ”

The environment in the affordable residential area was very poor.

Shen Rong was used to living in luxurious villas. How could she be willing to live in a pigeon cage like this? She covered her nose with her hand and was extremely disgusted.

“Mu Yourong said in a low voice, “Mom, just bear with it! The money we have now is only enough to rent a house here. But don’t worry, I believe that we will be able to move out of here very soon.” ”

“Li Qiandong was moving things behind her when he received a phone call. “Hello, ziteng? You’re here in Yun Capital? Alright! Let’s meet and talk!” ”
