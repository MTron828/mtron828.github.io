Wechat?

“Hearing this, Zhao Xueyin’s eyes flashed with a mocking look. ”

This damn old woman really knew how to take an inch and take a mile.

“It was already very rare for Si lui to pay attention to Ming Yao, but she actually asked Si lui to add Ming Yao’s wechat. ”

Would si lui add Ming Yao’s Wechat?

Of course not!

“But in the next second, the color on Zhao Xueyin’s face instantly disappeared. ”

“”Sure.”Si lui took out his phone. “Ming Yao, What’s Your Wechat number? I’ll add you.” ”

Ming Yao reported her phone number.

“Si lui clicked to add, “You agree.” ”

“Okay.”Ming Yao clicked to agree.

Zhao Xueyin was stunned on the spot.

She couldn’t describe what she felt in her heart. She was so aggrieved that she was about to cry.

“Not only did lawyer si not embarrass Ming Yao, he was even so polite. He even added Ming Yao’s wechat, making all the socialites present envious. ”

But wasn’t the person lawyer Si liked her?

Why did lawyer si add Ming Yao’s Wechat?

Could it be that lawyer Si’s heart changed so quickly!

It couldn’t be.

Lawyer Si loved her.

He wouldn’t change his heart.

A person like Ming Yao wasn’t worthy of Si lui at all.

Si Lui loved her!

It should be her!

Zhao Xueyin pinched her fingers. Her face was very pale.

“Wen Si Lan turned to look at Zhao Xueyin and asked curiously, “Xueyin, are you feeling unwell? Why do you look so pale?” ”

“I’m fine.”Zhao Xueyin shook her head and tried her best to act as if nothing had happened. “I’m going to the washroom.”

She needed to calm down now.

“Shall I go with you?”Wen Silan was a little worried when she saw Zhao Xueyin’s expression.

“”No need.”Zhao Xueyin continued, “I’ll go alone.” ” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“”Alright then.”Wen Silan continued, “If there are any problems, call me.” ”

“Okay.”Zhao Xueyin nodded.

“When she came to the bathroom, Zhao Xueyin turned on the tap and washed her face with cold water. Only then did she slowly calm down. ”

The reason why the lawyer was so warm to Ming Yao was definitely to deal with Old Lady Ming.

“After all, the Ming family wasn’t a small family. ”

There was another reason. It was because the lawyer didn’t see her.

“If the lawyer saw her, he definitely wouldn’t be so warm to Ming Yao. ”

“Thinking of this, Zhao Xueyin heaved a sigh of relief. She opened her bag, picked up the air cushion and lipstick mascara, and started to touch up her makeup. ”

At the banquet hall.

“Old Madam Ming called Ming Yao to the side. “Yaoyao, what do you think of Ruyu?” ”

“That’s right, old madam Ming wanted to set these two people up. ”

“Ming Yao was already 26 this year. A girl only had a few years of youth. If she delayed it, it would be difficult for her to find young talents in the future. ”

“”It looks okay at the moment,”Ming Yao said in a very pertinent manner. “But we still have to get along.” ”

“Hearing this, Old Lady Ming nodded with satisfaction. “Okay, then you young people should chat more.” ”

“After she said this.., old Lady Ming continued, “Actually, the Jin family is really not bad. Ruyu is an only child. In the future, you don’t have to worry about people snatching the family property from you and doing those scheming things. You are also a simple-minded child. If I really let you get involved in those things, you really won’t be able to handle it.” ”

“Old Madam Ming had experienced too many scheming and scheming in her life. Naturally, she didn’t want her granddaughter to experience the same thing. ”

“Ming Yao nodded. “Yes, I know.” ”

“Old Madam Ming patted Ming Yao’s hand. “Alright, go quickly! Go and chat with Ruyu duo.” ”

Ming Yao walked over.

Si lui stood in the middle of the crowd. He didn’t respond to the socialites’attempts to strike up a conversation.

“From the looks of it, he was indeed quite serious. No Wonder Old Madam Ming was so satisfied with him. ”

“Jin Ruyu.”Ming Yao walked over.

Si lui looked back slightly.

“Ming Yao continued, “Shall We Talk Over There?” ”

“Sure.”Si lui followed Ming Yao’s footsteps.

The two of them went outside.

“Compared to the inside, the outside was much quieter. ”

“Ming Yao didn’t beat around the bush and said directly, “You should have seen through my grandmother’s intentions.” ”

“Si Lu nodded. “To be honest, my father also has the same intention.” ”

Ming Yao smiled at Si Lu. “Then what do you mean?”

“What About You?”Si Lu asked back.

Ming Yao was much more lively than he had imagined.

She was not as stiff and wooden as the others.

“Ming Yao said, “I’m 26 years old this year and have never had a boyfriend. When I was in junior high school, I had a crush on a boy. Now That Boy is married and has children. My grandmother and my parents are very satisfied with you.” ”
