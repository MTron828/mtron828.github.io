“Why did elder Zhang ask me to go over?”Ye Zhuo wiped his mouth with a tissue.

The assistant briefly told him what had happened.

“Hearing this, Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly. ”

DK Financial Group?

Master Five?

Who was that?

Ye Zhuo followed his assistant over. “Elder Zhang.”

“”Burning burning.”Seeing ye Zhuo come over, elder Zhang smiled, then, he said, “Zao Zao, this is DK Financial Group’s deputy chief Li Ruo. Deputy Chief Li, this is elder Ye’s great-granddaughter, Ye Zao. She is also the new president of our Shunxi Financial Group.” ”

“”Hello, Miss Ye.”Li Ruo extended her hand to ye Zao in a gentlemanly manner. ”

“Although the girl in front of him was young, she already had the ability to make people’s breathing become chaotic. ”

No wonder that person was so worried.

A smile flashed across Li Ruo’s eyes.

It was fleeting.

“Hello.”Ye Zao reached out and held his hand.

“Li Ruo quickly released ye Zao’s hand and continued, “Miss Ye, this is the gift our fifth master prepared for you. Fifth Master hopes that you can personally open the red silk on it.” ”

Ye Zao nodded slightly and walked to the front of the red silk. He reached out slightly and pulled open the red silk just like that.

Hua —

“In an instant, the rays of light were boundless. Under the refraction of the crystal light, it was so piercing that one could hardly open their eyes. ”

“After seeing clearly what it was, everyone sucked in a breath of cold air. ”

A Phoenix.

This was a phoenix that roamed the sky and returned after bathing in flames!

The Phoenix was made of pure gold.

The tail of the Phoenix swayed as it spread its wings and soared. The entire sculpture of the Phoenix was lifelike.

It was breathtaking.

The Phoenix rose from the ashes and returned from the fire of Desire!

“It’s a Phoenix!”

“It’s so spectacular!”

“What does fifth master mean by this?”

“”Can’t you tell? Fifth Master is a dragon, Miss Ye, a Phoenix! What do you think it means?” ”

“It was already puzzling enough for fifth master to get someone to send a gift, and this gift was even a Phoenix... ”

Not everything was worthy of a Phoenix!

“For a moment, there were all sorts of things to say. ”

Ye Zhuo’s brows and eyes were still the same. No expression could be seen on his clear and handsome face. He turned to look at Li Ruo. “I’ll accept the gift. Help me thank your master five.”

Li Ruo nodded. “I’ll definitely bring Miss Ye’s words to you.”

“Thank you.”

“”Miss Ye is too polite.”After saying that, Li Ruo looked at elder Zhang and continued, “Since the gift has already been sent, I Won’t disturb you anymore. Elder Zhang, Farewell!” ”

Elder Zhang was still a little confused. “I’ll send you off.”

He looked at ye Zhuo who was standing beside the Phoenix.

Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes slightly.

She could roughly guess what this Phoenix of Lord Fifth’s meant.

This phoenix had two meanings.

The first meaning was to mock ye Zhuo. A Little Sparrow wanted to fly up to the branches and become a Phoenix?

Difficult!

The second meaning was that only she was a true Phoenix.

A Golden Phoenix that roamed the skies!

“Compared to her, ye Zao could not even be considered a little sparrow. ”

“Master five seemed to be giving ye Zao a gift, but he was actually mocking ye Zao. ”

“To be able to give such a gift, master five was really thoughtful. ”

“If it was anyone else, they really would not be able to guess Master Five’s true intentions! ”

Perhaps this was an evenly matched match.

“She and master five were the same kind of person, so she could instantly understand what master five meant. ”

Ye Zhoneng?

“Not only did ye Zhoneng not understand, but he also looked quite happy. ”

She did not know what she was so proud of.

She could not even see such an obvious irony.

Did she really think that Master Five’s Phoenix was a gift for her?

It was simply so stupid that it was cute.

“Zhao Xueyin curled the corners of her lips, and the corners of her mouth were full of ridicule. ”

“After sending Li Ruo out of the door and returning to the hall again, elder Zhang was still confused. He walked to Ye Zhoneng’s side and said, “Zhoneng, do you know master five from DK Financial Group?” ”

Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly. “I guess so.”If her guess was correct.

Elder Zhang nodded. “No wonder! No wonder!”

Ye Zao was a very outstanding person. It was normal for him to know master five.

“Zhao Xueyin happened to pass by Ye Zao. When she heard this, the mocking look in her eyes became even more obvious. ”

She did not expect ye Zao to boast shamelessly that he knew master five!

How Shameless!

“If it were anyone else, they would not be able to say that. ”

Ye Zao’s face could be said to be the corner of the city wall.

“Thinking of this, Zhao Xueyin paused for a moment before turning around and walking directly to ye Zao’s side. “Sister Ye Zao.” ”

Ye Zao raised his eyes slightly. “What’s the matter?”

“Zhao xueyin said meaningfully, “Sister ye Zao, you look so good in this gown! It’s like the stars surrounding the Moon. If I knew you were wearing it, I wouldn’t have worn it!” ”

“”You say it like you didn’t mean to wear the same gown as me.”Ye Zao leaned slightly and lowered his voice, “Zhao Xueyin, is it okay to make things worse?” ”
