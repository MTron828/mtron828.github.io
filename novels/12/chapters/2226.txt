“”It’s not just your fault, I’m also responsible.”The girl took the brooch with both hands. ”

...

“In the blink of an eye, the next day arrived. ”

The group split into two groups and boarded the interstellar shuttle to set off for Earth.

“Man Wen stood in front of the French window and looked into the distance. After a moment, he slowly said, “Sister, have a safe journey.” ”

“After today’s farewell, no one knew when they would be able to meet again. ”

“Three days later, the interstellar shuttle successfully arrived on Earth. ”

“Have we arrived?”Shi Qingcheng was a little excited.

“We’ve arrived.”Ye Han nodded.

Shi Qingcheng immediately came to the door and urged ye Han to open it.

Ye Han opened the cabin door.

Their landing location was the Cen family base.

“Because the surroundings were protected, it looked a little empty. ”

“Shi Qingcheng got off the aircraft and frowned slightly. “Didn’t you say that Earth is beautiful? I think it’s just like that! It’s not even as good as our desert region!”In Galaxy F, there were also desert regions.., however, the desert in Galaxy F was not so barren, only slightly worse than the downtown area. ”

“Ye Han explained, “This is my brother-in-law’s base, and we haven’t reached the real outside yet.” ”

“As soon as he finished speaking, Cen Hai ran over from the side. “Mr. Xiao Ye.” ”

“”Cen Hai Ge.”Ye Han greeted with a smile. “Let me introduce you. This is my girlfriend, Shi Qingcheng.” ”

“”Hello, Miss Shi. I’m Cen Hai. Shanjin Cen, Hai of the sea.”Cen Hai took the initiative to shake hands with Shi Qingcheng. ”

“Hello.”Shi Qingcheng shook hands with Cen Hai.

“Cen Hai continued, “Mr. Xiao Ye, Miss Ye and the others have already arrived. Please follow me quickly.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Han nodded and followed Cen Hai’s footsteps.

The three of them walked towards the inner part of the base.

“The deeper they walked, the greater the change in Shi Qingcheng’s expression. Gradually, her eyes were filled with shock. ”

“So the technology on Earth has also developed so much!”

“Previously, Shi Qingcheng’s impression of earth had always been that it was poor and backward, with rotten long braids. She had never thought that Earth would have such high technology. ”

This was very different from what she had imagined.

“Ye Han smiled and said, “Actually, when I first came here, I was the same as you. Actually, sometimes I feel that Earth is more suitable for living.” ”

“The Aura of life on Earth was more abundant, and so was the human nature. ”

“Is this all your brother-in-law’s Home?”Shi Qingcheng looked at Ye Han.

Ye Han nodded.

“Shi Qingcheng continued, “It seems that your brother-in-law is not only very powerful in the s galaxy, but also very powerful on Earth!” ”

“”Indeed,”ye Han said. ”

“Soon, they arrived at the CEN family base. ”

Ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing were already eating.

“Seeing Shi Qingcheng and ye Han come over, Ye Zhuo stood up and said, “You guys come over and eat something.” ”

“Shi Qingcheng was like Ye Han who had come to Earth for the first time. When she saw the food, she immediately waved her hand and said, “No, no, I just ate.” ”

“Ye Han picked up a piece of cake and said with a smile, “Try it, it’s really delicious! If you don’t eat it, you’ll definitely regret it!” ”

“I won’t regret it.”Shi Qingcheng covered her mouth.

“It was Shi Qingcheng’s first time on Earth, so ye Han planned to show her around. ”

“However, Ye Han was not very familiar with the capital, and Ye Zhuo was very busy, so ye Han could only ask Lin Ze to be his tour guide. ”

“There were many scenic spots in the capital. Walking along the white walls and small paths, it was as if one had traveled back to that era. ”

“Shi Qingcheng had never seen such a building before. For a moment, she took pictures everywhere. ”

“”Brother Ze, help us take a picture.” ”

Shi Qingcheng held ye Han’s hand and made various poses.

Lin Ze was in charge of taking pictures for them.

“At this moment, his back bumped into another person who was holding a camera and taking pictures everywhere. ”

Pa.. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The camera fell to the ground.

“Both hands covered the camera at the same time. When they looked up, they saw each other’s faces. Almost at the same time, they asked, “It’s You?” ”

“That day, they received the camera on the street of the alliance. ”

“At that time, it was Lin Ze who had accidentally knocked the book on the ground. ”

“”Are You Alright?”Shi Qingcheng and ye Han jogged over. When they saw who it was, Ye Han said in surprise, “Miss Bai!” ”

“Bai Jingshu did not expect ye Han to appear here either. She smiled and said, “Mr. Ye.” ”

“Shi Qingcheng asked curiously, “Do you know each other?” ”

“Ye Han nodded and continued, “Miss Bai, let me introduce you. This is my girlfriend, Shi Qingcheng. This is my brother, Lin Ze.” ”
