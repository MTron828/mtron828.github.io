“No matter what, they could not let ye Langhua find Little Half Moon. ”

“”I have an idea,”Yang Jiao suddenly said from the side. ”

“Stop meddling!”Xi Muwen’s face was full of impatience.

Yang Jiao was just a rich lady who knew nothing except playing cards.

“If Xi Weiyue had not followed him, she would probably be a pretty girl as well. ”

“”What’s wrong with me?”Yang Jiao put her hands on her hips. “You don’t like me? If you don’t like me, then don’t marry me back then!” ”

“”Okay, okay, mom and dad, stop arguing!”Xi Weiyue looked at Xi Muwen. “Dad, listen to what mom has to say. Maybe she really has a solution!” ”

“What good solution can she have?”Xi Muwen scoffed.

“Yang Jiao was about to scold her when Xi Weiyue smiled. “Mom, tell me. If My Dad won’t listen, I’ll listen.” ”

“”My Daughter is still the best!”Yang Jiao continued, “Isn’t that crazy woman dreaming of finding her daughter? She even said that as long as she finds her daughter, she’ll do anything for her. Then, we’ll help her find her daughter!” ”

“Xi Weiyue frowned slightly, not understanding the meaning behind Yang Jiao’s words. ”

Xi Muwen was surprised to understand what Yang Jiao meant. His eyes lit up instantly. “You mean to find someone to impersonate Little Half Moon?”

“Yes.”Yang Jiao nodded.

“XI weiyue said, “Now that medicine is so advanced, the results of the DNA test will be out on the same day. This method shouldn’t work, right?” ”

“”That’s simple.”Yang Jiao smiled. “When the time comes, just secretly change the sample.” ”

“Xi Weiyue narrowed her eyes. “That’s not a bad move, but who should we find to pretend to be Xiao Banyue?” ”

“”First of all, we can’t look too bad,”Yang Jiao continued. “Second, we can’t be too smart.”It was not easy to control someone who was too smart. ”

“Xi Weiyue turned to XI Muwen. “Dad, what do you think of this move?” ”

Xi Muwen lit a cigar but did not immediately answer Xi Weiyue.

“”Father, actually, I think mother’s idea is very inappropriate. That crazy woman has never treated us as a family from the start. No matter how good I am to her, she will never treat me as her own daughter. Rather than waiting like this, it’s better to take the initiative to attack.” ”

“Actually, Xi Muwen’s original plan was to make ye Langhua treat Xi Weiyue as her own daughter. ”

“This way, Xi Weiyue could rightfully inherit everything that ye Langhua had. ” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

What a pity.

“It had been so many years, but ye Langhua still could not forget little half a month. Although she was still considered close to Xi Weiyue, compared to her biological daughter, she was not just a little bit inferior. ”

“Yang Jiao continued, “I don’t Know What You’re hesitating about! Back then, you were too indecisive. If you had killed that little bastard, there wouldn’t be such trouble now!” ”

“In the end, Xi Muwen was too soft-hearted and did not want to kill half a month. ”

“Xi Muwen frowned. After a long while, he looked up at Yang Jiao. “Okay! We’ll do as you say!” ”

“”So you agree?”Yang Jiao was overjoyed. They had been married for so many years, and this was the first time XI Muwen had acknowledged her. ”

It was not easy.

“Xi muwen nodded and said, “Go to the rescue station more often these few days.” ”

“Why do you want to go to the rescue station?”Yang Jiao frowned.

How many rich people’s wives were willing to go to places like the rescue station.

It was dirty.

There were even more lunatics.

“XI weiyue smiled and said, “Father’s meaning should be to let you find a good vagabond in the aid station.” ”

“”It’d better be someone with mental problems,”Xi Muwen added. ”

Who was the best person to handle?

Of course it was a fool!

“Xi Weiyue said with some worry, “That crazy woman was a talented girl when she was young. Her daughter is not very intelligent. Wouldn’t she suspect it?” ”

“No.”Xi Muwen shook his head. “Half a month has been missing for more than 30 years. Who knows what kind of torture she went through during this process? The methods of those human traffickers are more and more cruel. Isn’t it normal for their intelligence to be damaged?”

“Xi Weiyue nodded in agreement. “Dad, you’re right.” ”

“”Then, shall I go to the Rescue Station Tomorrow?”Yang Jiao asked. ”

“”Sure.”Xi Muwen nodded. “To avoid a long delay, this kind of thing shouldn’t be delayed.” ”

“Yang Jiao was an impatient person. When she heard this, she immediately stood up from the sofa. “Then, I’ll go now!” ”

Xi Muwen waved his hand. “You can go now too.”

Yang Jiao immediately went back to her room to change and get her bag.
