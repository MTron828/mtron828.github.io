Chapter 748: 168: Scorching Hot: get first place! 1

Translator: 549690339

Feng Xianxian was now full of confidence in herself.

She believed that she would definitely be able to get first place in the assessment competition.

“Firstly, it was because her strength was already very high.”

“Secondly, there was the answer provided by Liu Caiyi.”

This was already a matter where victory was in the bag.

“Liu caiyi smiled and said, “Of course it’s true.”She had a good relationship with Teng Xin. In addition, she didn’t have many acquaintances in the literary world, so Teng Xin told her everything in just a few sentences.”

“Although the exam questions for this year’s exam were very difficult, they had already prepared for it, so they didn’t need to worry at all.”

“”Sister Caiyi, thank you.”Feng Xianxian invited Liu Caiyi into the room.”

“Liu Caiyi said, “You’re welcome.”She was helping Feng Xianxian out of justice because she didn’t like people doing tricks behind her back. The literary world couldn’t be entered just by looking.”

“As for Ye Zhuo, other than that face, he was completely useless.”

The literary world was not the entertainment industry.

“In the literary world, those who were good-looking were called vases, and those who were called idiots.”

Only those who had real talent could be called talented women.

“For someone like Ye Zhuo, she probably would not even know how to copy the answer into her hands.”

She could not compare with Feng Xianxian at all.

“Although Liu Caiyi had revealed the test questions to Feng Xianxian, Liu Caiyi didn’t think that she was helping Feng Xianxian cheat.”

“For people without ability, even if they told her all the questions, she might not be able to do it.”

“Entering the house, Feng Xianxian poured tea for Liu Caiyi.”

...

On the other side.

At the elegant residence teahouse.

Master Yu sat cross-legged on the couch. There was a tea set on the short table in front of him. The young man sitting opposite him wore a long robe with his thin lips tightly pursed. His ten fingers continuously shuttled between the porcelain-white tea set.

The rising smoke from the tea blurred his face. Beside the short table was a string of bright red Buddha beads.

“In a moment, he poured the clear tea into the Teacup. “Master, Please.””

Master Yu picked up a cup of tea. “The bitter taste returns the sweetness. The sweetness doesn’t get tired. Good Tea!”

The young man opposite him also picked up a cup of tea and took a sip.

The smoke from the tea dispersed and the man’s exquisite and peerless face appeared in the air.

“His skin was very white, the kind that had not seen the sun for a long time. There was a red mole at the end of his eye, which carried a hint of sickness, and a hint of coldness and wildness.”

“There was a sense of solemnity in the elegant room, and his body was covered in a layer of snow.”

It made people feel a little intimidated.

This was Cen Shaoqing.

“Master Yu continued, “Let me tell you something.””

“Please tell me.”Cen Shaoqing picked up the Buddha bead.

“Master Yu glanced at Cen Shaoqing. “Tell me, how did you start to believe in Buddhism at such a young age?”Not only did he believe in Buddhism, he was also a vegetarian... When he first met Cen Shaoqing, master Yu thought that he had met a good seedling. Reality proved that Cen Shaoqing did not disappoint him. This person’s literary attainments had almost exceeded his imagination.”

Who would have thought.

“Halfway through, Cen Shaoqing suddenly saw through the secular world and said that he wanted to become a monk...”

“In the end, under the interference of the Cen Old Lady, although Cen Shaoqing did not become a monk, he began to live the life of a monk.”

He ate vegetarian and prayed to Buddha. He went to the temple and stayed there for ten days to half a month.

Cen Shaoqing drank a mouthful of tea and did not speak.

“He was not a talkative person, so master Yu did not find it strange. He continued, “Recently, I Found You a junior sister.””

“You took in a disciple?”Cen Shaoqing raised his eyebrows.

“Master Yu nodded. There was some excitement in his eyes, “Yes, let me tell you. That junior sister of yours is talented and charming. She is the future hope of the literary world! And she writes very well! Other than you, I have never seen such a good seedling!””

Master Yu was very satisfied with ye Zao.

Very satisfied.

“Although the people around him were doubtful of his choice, he believed that ye Zao would definitely surprise everyone.”

This assessment was also ye Zao’s fame competition!

Cen Shaoqing’s expression was the same as usual. He nodded slightly. “OH.”

Oh?

“Ye Zao was so amazing, yet Cen Shaoqing was given an ‘oh?'”

“Master Yu continued, “The assessment is in three days. When that time comes, your junior sister will also participate. As a senior brother, shouldn’t you come and cheer for your junior sister on the spot? “I’ll introduce you and your junior brother to each other as well.””

“When he accepted ye Zao as his disciple that day, he had originally planned to invite Cen Shaoqing to participate. However, Cen Shaoqing happened to have something on, so he was delayed.”

“Thus, up until now, they had not gotten to know each other.”

“Cen Shaoqing took a sip of tea. “I’ve already left the literary world for many years. There’s no need to get to know each other, right?””Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m
