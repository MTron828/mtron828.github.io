“Feng Juan looked at Li Dalong and asked, “Are you serious?” ”

“”I’m serious.”Li Dalong’s eyes were full of seriousness, then he said, “If you don’t like the decorations at home, you can redecorate it. During this period of time, we can live outside. Or isn’t it fashionable for young people nowadays to travel and get married? “Let’s go on a trip and get married. When we come back, the house will be renovated.” ”

“Okay.”Feng Juan nodded. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

No woman would like the things left behind by her husband and ex-wife.

“Feng Juan was a very ordinary woman, so she was naturally no exception. ”

“Feng Juan continued, “Can I renovate the house?” ”

“”You are the hostess, so of course you can do it.”Li Dalong stood up and said, “I’ll go get the household register. Let’s go to the Civil Affairs Bureau now.” ”

“”My household register is still at home,”Feng Juan said. ”

“It’s okay. We’ll be there soon by car.”

“Before they went to the Civil Affairs Bureau, the two of them went to the hospital for a wedding check-up. ”

“Feng Juan looked at the doctor and asked, “Doctor, my husband and I are now at this age. Is it easy to have children?” ”

“At present, the two-child policy was fully open. There were people like Feng Juan and Li Dalong every day. The doctor was already used to it. He smiled and said, “As long as you want it, you can have it anytime.” ”

“”Okay.”Feng Juan nodded. “Thank you, Doctor.” ”

“You’re welcome.”

“After leaving the hospital, the two of them went straight to the civil affairs bureau. ”

“Today was not a special festival, so there were not many people in the civil affairs bureau. ”

The two of them quickly received their marriage certificate.

“Li Da Long was very excited. He held Feng Juan’s hand and said, “Let’s have a big meal tonight.” ”

“Okay.”

Two people who knew each other well were destined to have a happy ending when they got together.

“After returning home, Li da long cleaned up all the things related to Zhou Cuihua and Li Hang. ”

The house keys were also changed.

“The next day, the two of them prepared to go on a trip outside. ”

“Li Da Long had been busy for most of his life, but he had never officially gone out to play. This time, he could have a good time. ”

“On the other side, Li Hang officially moved to the Lookout Pavilion Courtyard. ”

“That night, boss Wang treated Li Hang to a grand reception. ”

“”Hang Hang will be an official member of our big family in the future. If you need anything in the future, don’t stand on ceremony. Just ask us directly.” ”

“”Thank you, Uncle Wang.”Li hang raised his glass. “Let me toast to you.” ”

“Zhou cuihua felt that it was a little strange because she did not see an old lady at the dining table. She asked, “Where’s the Old Lady?” ”

“Boss Wang said, “My mother was picked up by my sister.” ”

“Zhou cuihua said in surprise, “You have an older sister?” ”

“Boss Wang nodded. “My Sister is in love with a young man and has married far away. She originally wanted to treat you to a meal, but time was too short, so she did not stay for long.” ”

“OH.”

“”Don’t worry. There will be plenty of opportunities to meet in the future,”boss Wang added. ”

“Okay.”Zhou Cui Hua nodded.

“Actually, she didn’t care about boss Wang’s sister at all. ”

“After the meal, boss Wang said, “Cui Hua, I’m going on a business trip next, so I’ll have to trouble you to take care of everything at home.” ”

“After saying that, boss Wang looked at the housekeeper. “While I’m not at home, just listen to Madam.” ”

“”Yes, sir.” ”

Zhou cuihua smiled.

Li Hang looked at boss Wang and felt more at ease.

“From the looks of it, boss Wang really treated Zhou cuihua very well. ”

“In the blink of an eye, half a month passed. ”

“During this month, Li Hang and Zhou Cuihua had been staying at the Wang family’s residence. ”

“Li hang asked curiously, “Mom, why did uncle Wang go on a business trip for such a long time? Did you ask him where he went?” ”

Boss Wang was a rich man to begin with. The place where he appeared was definitely surrounded by a bunch of women. What if he was tempted?

Li Hang was a little worried.

“Zhou cuihua said, “He went abroad and won’t be back for a while.” ”

“During this period of time, Zhou Cuihua was very comfortable. ”

She enjoyed the care of the servants every day. She only needed to play cards and show off her happy life to her good friends.

Zhou cuihua would invite a few good friends to play mahjong in the lookout pavilion courtyard every day.

None of her good friends were not envious of Zhou Cuihua’s good life. A woman who was married for the second time could actually find a rich businessman.

Zhou cuihua also enjoyed her current life very much.

“”Oh right, Hang Hang, do you think the detective agency we found is a liar? How could they investigate Xia Xiaoman? They haven’t come up with any results until now!” ”
