“”We’re just ordinary friends,”Lin ze replied. ”

“Ye Shu continued, “Ordinary friends. Will Jingshu find you the moment she’s in Danger?” ”

“No matter how she thought about it, she felt that something was wrong. ”

Especially Lin Ze’s reaction just now.

“”Bai Jingshu doesn’t have any other friends here,”Lin ze continued, “And I happen to have a grudge with that jerk.” ” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“What Grudge?”Ye Shu asked.

“Lin Ze said, “You don’t need to know that.” ”

“Ye Shu seemed to have thought of something and lowered her voice. “By the way, Jingshu wasn’t bullied, right?” ”

“No.”Lin Ze shook his head.

“”That’s good.”After saying that, ye Shu continued, “There are too many bad guys nowadays! You have to tell burning. Be careful in everything.” ”

“Lin Ze smiled and said, “I’m afraid even I can’t beat burning.” ”

The meaning of being blind was that no one would be able to beat ye burning.

“Ye Shu said, “There are even stronger ones. You Can’t beat them. It doesn’t mean that you can’t beat them.” ”

“You’re right.”

“Ye Shu continued, “Did Jingshu tell you when she’ll be back?” ”

“She didn’t say that.”Lin Ze shook his head.

“”You’re such a stupid child,”ye Shu complained. “No wonder you’ve always been single. You were almost cheated by someone!” ”

Lin Ze:”...”

On the other side.

S galaxy.

Chen Yaosheng was sent to the police station by the core robot arranged by Lin Ze.

“With all kinds of evidence, the police station quickly detained Chen Yaosheng. ”

“When Chen Yaosheng woke up from his coma, he was already lying in the detention center. ”

“When the Chen family received the news from the detention center, they immediately sent a lawyer to pick him up. No matter what, Chen Yaosheng was the second young master of the Chen family. No matter what, they had to do their best to bail Chen Yaosheng out. ”

They could not let the name of the Chen family leave a stain.

The Chen family hired the best lawyer to defend Chen Yaosheng.

“However, because the evidence was conclusive, unless the victim agreed to a settlement in court, Chen Yaosheng would be locked up for life! ”

“In desperation, the head of the Chen family had no choice but to personally make a trip to the Bai family. ”

“The status of the Chen family in the s galaxy was higher than that of the Bai family by several ranks. When they saw Chen Jinyan and his wife coming over, Zhou Ying and Bai Jiasheng immediately went out to welcome them. ”

“The head of the Chen family and Madam Chen have graced us with their presence. We are honored to have you here!”Bai Jiasheng said.

“Chen Jinyan looked at Bai Jiasheng and his wife and said, “Mr. Bai is too humble.” ”

“Madam Chen did not say anything, but her eyes were full of anger. ”

“If it were not for Bai Jingzhu, her son would not have been sent to prison. ”

The minimum sentence in the court was ten years.

“Every inch of time was worth an inch of gold. If Chen Yaosheng was really sent to prison for ten years, his life would be ruined. ”

The Bai family really raised a good daughter.

“The Bai couple weren’t good people either. They clearly knew everything, but they pretended to know nothing. ”

Disgusting!

“”Thank you for your high opinion of us, master Chen. Quick, please come in.”Bai Jiasheng immediately made a ‘please’gesture. ”

Chen Jinyan and Madam Chen raised their feet and walked in.

Bai Jiasheng and Zhou Ying followed behind. The husband and wife looked at each other. No one could tell why Chen Jinyan and his wife would suddenly come to the Bai family.

Could it be because of old master Bai?

“After all, Old Master Bai was young and had some friendship with Chen Jinyan. ”

Bai Jiasheng immediately got someone to serve the best tea.

“Chen Jinyan sat in the seat of honor and raised his hand. “There’s no need for tea. Mr. Bai, I think you should know why I’m here today, right?” ”

“Bai Jiasheng looked at Chen Jinyan. “Family head Chen, please speak clearly.” ”

How could he guess Chen Jinyan’s thoughts.

“”To be honest, we are here for the matter of our son.”Chen Jinyan raised his hand lightly. ”

A few core robot men carrying boxes immediately appeared outside the door.

“The core robot men carried the boxes to the hall, placed the boxes on the ground, and opened the lid. ”

The box was full of level three star energy.

“In the S Galaxy, star energy was more precious than star currency. Star energy represented the rise and fall of a family. With this star energy, the Bai family could at least rise from AA to SS. ”

“Seeing this, Bai Jiasheng’s eyes lit up. ”

Zhou Ying had the same expression.

They were really two common people!

The disgust in Mrs. Chen’s eyes was almost undisguised.

“”Mr. Bai, Mrs. Bai, this is our sincerity,”Chen Jinyan continued. ”
