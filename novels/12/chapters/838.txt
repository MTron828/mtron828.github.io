“Chapter 839: 184: an all-rounder, but not a dog”

Translator: 549690339

Cen?

CEN was not common in the capital.

It was especially true for those who were tall and powerful.

Xi Weiyue narrowed her eyes.

“Was it really as XI Muwen said, that man was Cen the fifth master?”

“XI weiyue then asked, “Is my aunt’s relationship with that Mr. Cen very deep?””

Xiao Mei nodded.

“How often does that Mr. Cen come to the shop?”

She had to seize the opportunity.

It would be best if she could have another chance encounter with him.

“If it really was fifth master Cen, then that would be her good fortune.”

Who wouldn’t want to climb up to fifth master Cen who stood at the top of the pyramid?

She was afraid that she wouldn’t have the chance.

“Xiao Mei frowned. “That’s hard to say. Sometimes it’s half a month, sometimes it’s a month, and sometimes it’s a week.””

“Xi Weiyue had an idea. She looked at Xiao Mei and said, “Sister Xiao Mei, if Mr. Cen comes again next time, can you please send me a Message?””

“”Sure.”Xi Weiyue gave her a bracelet worth 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. What was she doing for Xi Weiyue?”

“The average salary in the capital was 6,000 yuan.”

“30,000 yuan was equivalent to half a year’s salary!”

“Xi Weiyue looked at Xiao Mei. “Thank you, sister Xiao Mei.””

“”Miss Weiyue, you’re too kind.””

“After giving her instructions, Xi Weiyue got into the car.”

“Soon, she arrived at the Xi family home.”

“When he saw Xi Weiyue return, Xi Muwen said in surprise, “Weiyue, why are you back? Didn’t we agree to stay with your Aunt Tonight?””

“In order to let Xi Weiyue accompany ye Langhua, Xi Muwen specially held a birthday party for XI Weiyue one day in advance.”

“When she heard this, Xi Weiyue frowned. “Don’t mention it! It was that old hag who chased me out.””

“What’s going on?”

Xi Weiyue picked up a pillow gloomily. “Who knows what’s wrong with her.”

“Yang Jiao walked over from the side. When she saw Xi Weiyue return, she was also very surprised.”

Xi Muwen frowned.

“Xi Weiyue looked at XI Muwen and continued, “I think that dead old hag is really obsessed! She only wants to find her biological daughter. Father, are you sure that Ye Banyue is no longer alive?””

“MMM.”Xi Muwen nodded.

“In XI Muwen’s heart, that vile spawn had long died.”

“Even if it was not dead, it was most likely a retard and could not cause any waves.”

Xi Muwen had never seen that bastard take it to heart.

He even felt disgusted at the mention of it.

Half a month was a humiliation to him.

Only the smart and understanding Xi Weiyue was his precious daughter!

“”That’s good.”Xi Weiyue let out a sigh of relief. “Oh right, dad, the person I told you about the last time I saw the old lady, the restaurant staff told me today that his surname is Cen. Do you think he’s Cen Wu Ye?””

“Cen?”Xi Muwen narrowed his eyes.

“If his surname was Cen, then he might really be Cen Wu Ye.”

“After all, Xi Weiyue’s appearance was very similar to Cen Wu Ye.”

“Xi Weiyue nodded. “Yes, and I heard that the old lady has a very close relationship with him. Every time Mr. Cen goes over, she personally receives him.”” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Then, xi weiyue continued, “Father, how was the relationship between the Ye family and the Cen Family?””

Xi Muwen shook his head. “Nothing much.”

“Back then, when he and ye Langhua got married, there were no Cen family members present at the wedding.”

“If the Cen family and the Ye family had any relationship, they would definitely attend their wedding.”

Later on.

“When grandfather ye passed away, many families that were on good terms with the Ye family came to send grandfather ye off. The Cen family did not show up either.”

“”That’s strange.”Xi Weiyue squinted. “If there’s no relationship between the two families, then why does fifth master Cen have such a deep relationship with the old woman?””

Xi Muwen was also puzzled.

“Logically speaking, it should not be easy to befriend someone as unapproachable as fifth master Cen.”

“After a while, xi muwen continued, “Whether he’s fifth master Cen or not, we’d rather spend more time with him than Miss One. What if he really is?””

“After all, Ye Langhua had many secrets that no one knew.”

“XI weiyue smiled and said, “Father, you’re indeed my biological father. I think exactly the same as you.””

Xi Muwen smiled as well.

On the other side.

At the Lin residence.

“In the study, Ye Zhuo was drawing with his brush. Not long after, a lifelike ink painting appeared on the white rice paper.”
