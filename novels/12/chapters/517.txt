“Look at what you’re saying.”Feng Qianhua turned to look at Auntie Zhang. “I’ve always treated Auntie Lin as my biological mother.”

“”Old Madam,”the butler walked in from outside. “The old madam of the Feng family is here.””

“Old Madam Lin said, “Then hurry up and invite her in.””

“When she heard this, Auntie Zhang’s expression changed.”

“Feng Qianhua said, “Mrs. Zhang, my throat has been a little uncomfortable recently. Can you please make some snow pears with rock sugar for me? I like what you make. The other stews are not as good as yours.””

“Before Mrs. Zhang could say anything, Old Mrs. Lin smiled and said, “Since Qianhua likes it, then go quickly, Mrs. Zhang! Make some more and bring it to Qianhua.””

“Then I’ll go to the kitchen first.”

“Go.”Old Lady Lin nodded.

Mrs Zhang walked out of the door.

“Before she reached the door, she saw old madam Feng walking in.”

Mrs Zhang lowered her head and quickly walked past Old Madam Feng.

Old Madam Feng frowned.

“Subconsciously, she felt that this person was a little familiar.”

“By the time she calmed down and looked, he had already disappeared outside the door.”

Old Madam Feng turned her head to look outside.

“Seeing her like this, the butler asked, “Old Madam?””

Old Madam Feng then came back to her senses. “Who was that person just now?”

“The butler continued, “It seemed to be Auntie Zhang who was serving the old madam. Do you know her?””

Old Madam Feng shook her head. “I don’t know her. I might have seen her wrongly!”

How could she know a servant!

“Please come in.”The housekeeper made a ‘please’gesture.

Old Madam Feng walked in.

“Seeing old madam Feng come in, Old Madam Lin hurriedly sat up from the bed. “Elder sister, you’re here. Take a seat!””

Old Madam Lin originally thought that old madam Feng was here to seek an explanation for Feng Qianhua.

“After all, Feng Qianhua was about to get engaged to Lin Jincheng. It was one thing for her to suddenly cancel the engagement in the middle, but now she was going to hold a family recognition banquet!”

How could Feng Qianhua behave like this?

“However, not only did old madam Feng not come to find fault with her, but she also came to visit her.”

“”I heard from Qianhua that you have not been well recently, so I came to take a look. Now that I see that you are fine, I am relieved.””

Old Madam Lin was stunned for a moment and sighed with emotion in her heart.

“”Elder sister, thank you for your concern. I Am Fine.”Old Madam Lin continued, “Speaking of which, it is our Lin family that has let down Qianhua and your Lin Family!””

“Old Madam Feng smiled and said, “We are both parents. I know that this matter is not your fault! Children and grandchildren will have their own blessings. In the future, I Won’t care anymore. I just feel sorry for Qianhua. I’ve waited for 19 years, but in the end...””

“When she said the last sentence, old madam Feng sighed.”

Feng Qianhua patted old madam Feng’s hand. “I’m fine.”

“Old Madam Lin said, “Elder sister, I know what I’m doing! Don’t worry. In My Heart, Qianhua has always been our Lin family’s daughter-in-law. And Xianxian, Xianxian is my biological granddaughter! She’s not some random person who can be compared to the mother and daughter!””

“When she heard this, old madam Feng heaved a sigh of relief.”

She had also heard about Lin Ze’s biological mother.

She felt that the mother and daughter pair could not be compared to Feng Qianhua and Feng Xianxian.

Anyone with a discerning eye would know what to choose.

“Old Madam Feng continued, “Since you’ve Said So, then I won’t treat you as an outsider. Xianxian, that child, is already 19 years old this year. They say that when a daughter is old, she can’t be kept. In the future, she’ll have to rely on you for the important matters of her life.””

“Old Madam Lin smiled and said, “Sure, sure. Actually, I already have someone in mind.””

“Which family is it?”Old Madam Feng asked.

“Old Madam Lin said, “The CEN family.””

“Although old madam Lin had already explicitly rejected her, old madam Lin felt that with her friendship with old Madam Cen, as long as she seriously mentioned this matter to old Madam Cen, Old Madam Cen would definitely agree.”

“Feng Xianxian was so outstanding. Unless old Madam Cen was blind, she would not agree.”

Hearing this.

Old Madam Feng narrowed her eyes. It seemed that Feng Qianhua was not lying to her.

“Everyone in the capital knew that Old Lady Cen and Old Lady Lin were old friends. The relationship between the two was very deep. As long as Old Lady Lin was willing to speak, this matter would most likely be settled.”

“After getting the answer she wanted, old madam Feng left the Lin family after saying a few words to Old Lady Lin.”

“Not long after old madam Feng left, Aunt Zhang came in with a glass of snow pear. “Miss Qianhua, quickly try it and see if it tastes right.””

“”Thank you for your hard work, Aunt Zhang.”Feng Qianhua stood up and took the bowl. She took a sip and said, “Yes! This is the taste.””
