“A2 members? Where did the A2 members come from?”Professor Yue had never heard of the A2 members after working in the base for so many years.

“”I don’t know exactly where the A2 members came from. I only know that they have replaced everyone! Professor Yue, what do you think we should do now?” ”

Tang Xue was very anxious. She had hoped that Professor Yue could threaten Cen Shaoqing and make ye Zhuo apologize to her in public. She had lost all face.

Who would have thought that an A-2 member would suddenly appear on the way!

Who exactly were they?

Professor Yu looked at Tang Xue. “Are you sure that what you said is true?”

“”It’s true!”Tang Xue nodded very seriously. “Professor Yue, if you don’t believe me, you can call and ask. Everyone saw it!” ”

“Professor Yue and Tang Xue’s grandfather had some friendship, so he naturally knew that Tang Xue wouldn’t lie to her. ”

“Do you know that you came to look for my fifth master?”Professor Yue asked. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“I don’t know.”Tang Xue shook her head.

“Professor Yue narrowed his eyes. “Then after I left, did fifth master look for You?” ”

“No.”Tang Xue still shook her head.

This was a little strange.

Could it be that Cen Shaoqing didn’t care about the strike at all?

“”Professor Yue, all the members of the research room in Area B have been replaced. What are you going to do?” ”

“With professor Yue in the base, Tang Xue had a backer. ”

“If professor Yue wasn’t here, who would she rely on in the future? ”

“”It’s fine.”Professor Yue didn’t panic at all. “Little Xue, I’ve been in the base for more than 20 years. Do you think that my position can be replaced just because I said so?” ”

“If he did not have some strength, professor Yue would not have taken the position of professor. ”

“Hearing this, Tang Xue’s eyes lit up. “Aunt Yue, you have a backup plan?” ”

“In front of Tang Xue, Professor Yue did not hold back at all. He nodded and said, “Yes.” ”

“Professor Yue smiled and said, “The A2 members are just a cover! I’ve been in the base for so many years, but I’ve never heard of the A2 members. Master five wants to use this to scare us! “So that we can quickly go back and apologize to him! “Unfortunately, he doesn’t know that there’s a saying in this world that goes, ‘The older the wiser!’! “He thought that I would definitely be frightened this time, but he didn’t know that I had seen through his little tricks!” ”

“Hearing this, Tang Xue was suddenly enlightened. She smiled and said, “So that’s how it is.” ”

“Professor Yue added, “Area B and Country L have a cooperation. The agreed delivery time is five days later. Unless master five wants to breach the contract, otherwise, just a group of A-2 members won’t be able to deliver the goods within the agreed delivery time.” ”

This batch of goods from country L were all high-tech electronic products.

There was a program that had to be set by professor Yue personally.

“Other than Professor Yue, no one else could set it. ”

Not only that.

Professor Yue had also set a password on the chip.

“Before the program could be reset, the password had to be broken. ”

“In the entire base, there were very few people who could break the password that she had set. ”

“Hearing this, Tang Xue immediately understood professor Yue’s meaning. She smiled and said, “So, this fifth master must come and Beg You!” ”

Professor Yue nodded.

“”Aunt Yue, you still have a way!” ”

“Professor Yue smiled and said, “Otherwise, why do you say that the older the wiser? If you want to fight with me, this fifth master is still too young.” ”

“After all, his age was obvious. ”

How Old was Cen Shaoqing?

32 years old!

Did he really think that she was 16 years older than him and that she was from white university?

“On the other side, the other members of the research unit also learned that the research unit had been replaced by a 2 member. ”

Everyone looked for Sun Yu and expressed their worries.

“”Brother Sun, what should we do? Why Don’t we take the initiative to go back! The contract says that a strike of three days is considered to be a breach of contract and an automatic resignation!” ”

“Old Qian is right. It wasn’t easy for us to get into the base. We can’t be fired just like that!”

“...”

“Sun Yu had already spoken to professor Yue on the phone, she smiled and said, “Don’t worry, everyone! The CEN Corporation wouldn’t dare to fire us so casually! “If our research room can be so easily replaced, then wouldn’t Professor Yue’s twenty years in the CEN Corporation base have been for Nothing?” ”

“Hearing this, everyone immediately understood. “Brother Sun, do you mean that fifth master is scaring us?” ”

“”It’s obvious whether he’s scaring us or Not!”Sun Yu continued, “All of us have signed a joint letter. Do you want to go back on Your Words?” ”

“If it wasn’t for scaring them, what A2 member would Cen Shaoqing produce? ”
