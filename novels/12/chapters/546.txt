“Hearing Zhao Shuqi’s words, Zhao shuning heaved a sigh of relief. “Brother, I’ll have to Trouble You Then. Can I go after 12 o’clock tomorrow afternoon?” ”

“At 11 o’clock in the morning, Feng Qianhua would come over to deliver the health soup to Old Lady Lin. ”

“At 12 am, she was free. ”

“On the other end of the phone, Zhao Shuqi flipped a page of the document in his hands. “Sure. If there are any problems, you can just call me.” ”

“Okay.”

Zhao shuning hung up the phone in satisfaction.

“Madam Lin asked impatiently, “Shuning, what did your brother say?” ”

“Zhao shuning smiled and said, “It’s just a name change. To my brother, it’s just a matter of words.” ”

“Hearing this, Old Madam Lin was very excited. “Shuning, then I really have to thank your brother.” ”

“Zhao shuning said, “We’re all family. What’s there to thank? Once we’ve changed our name, Let’s see how that B * Tch Ye Shu will continue to torment us!” ”

Old Madam Lin nodded and agreed with Zhao Shuning’s words.

“”Shuning, I’ve let you stay in the Lin family all these years. It’s really been hard on you.”Old Madam Lin held Zhao Shuning’s hand. “You and Qingxuan aren’t young anymore. When are you going to adopt one?” ”

“When she mentioned this, guilt appeared in Old Mrs. Lin’s eyes. ”

The Lin family had let down Zhao shuning.

“When Lin Qingxuan and Zhao shuning had just gotten married, Old Mrs. Lin had been urging them to have children. However, they had been married for two or three years, and Zhao Shuning’s stomach hadn’t moved at all. ”

“Old Mrs. Lin thought that Zhao shuning wouldn’t give birth, so she made things difficult for Zhao shuning. ”

“Who knew that after going to the hospital for a check-up, the person who wouldn’t give birth was Lin Qingxuan. ”

“However, in order to protect the Lin family and Lin Qingxuan’s reputation, Zhao shuning actually announced to the outside world that the person who wouldn’t give birth was her. ”

“Over the years, Zhao shuning had suffered a lot because of this. ”

That woman didn’t want to be a mother for once.

“However, Zhao shuning voluntarily gave up the right to be a mother for Lin Qingxuan. ”

“As both women, Old Lady Lin felt especially sorry for Zhao shuning. ”

Zhao shuning was sensible and knew how to take care of the big picture.

She was nothing like that B * Tch ye Shu!

“It was one thing if she didn’t know how to take care of the big picture, but now, she still dared to look down on her mother-in-law! ”

What right did this kind of woman have to enter the Lin family’s gates!

“Zhao shuning smiled and said, “Mom, the children in the Welfare Institute are already six or seven years old. They have their own memories and can’t be properly raised! Qingxuan and I plan to carry a newborn child.” ”

“”Then, do you have any plans?”Old Lady Lin asked. ”

“Zhao shuning nodded. “I’ve already asked my mom to pay attention to the situation in my hometown in the countryside. If there’s a suitable one, bring it back and raise it.” ”

“”Shuning, you’re right. It’s best to raise this child from a young age.” ”

“Zhao shuning continued, “Mom, don’t be angry. Tomorrow afternoon, we’ll go to the Public Security Bureau and Change That Girl’s name! It’s getting late, so I’ll go back and Rest First!” ”

“”Okay, you should go back and rest.” ”

Zhao shuning’s room was in the west wing.

“When Zhao Shuning returned to her room, Lin Qingxuan was making tea. “You’re back.” ”

“Okay.”Zhao shuning nodded. “I have to accompany mom on some errands tomorrow. Go iron my silk dress.” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Because she felt guilty towards Zhao shuning, Zhao shuning and Lin Qingxuan didn’t seem like a couple. ”

It was more like an employment relationship.

Lin Qingxuan never said ‘no’to Zhao shuning.

“Okay.”Lin Qingxuan put down the Teacup and went to iron her skirt.

“While ironing her skirt, lin qingxuan asked curiously, “Shuning, where are you going with Mom Tomorrow?” ”

“I’m going out to do something.”Zhao shuning lowered her head to look at her phone.

“”Do what?”Lin Qingxuan continued, “It can’t be about changing the name of searing Jade, right?” ”

“Zhao shuning smiled and said, “You’re right.” ”

“Lin Qingxuan frowned and said hesitantly, “Shuning, Jin city and the fifth sister-in-law don’t agree to change the child’s name. Why don’t we not interfere in this matter?” ”

“”Lin Qingxuan, what do you mean?”Zhao shuning’s expression changed immediately, “Do you think I’m meddling? Do you know how our mother was angered by that Vixen just now? I think you’re interested in that Vixen, ye Shu!” ”

Vixen?

“Lin Qingxuan’s expression was also a little ugly. He didn’t even say anything to Ye Shu, so how could he take a liking to her? ”

“”Shuning, calm down. No matter what, we’re family with the fifth sister-in-law. Don’t be so harsh with your words...” ”

“Zhao shuning glared at Lin Qingxuan and directly interrupted him, “Lin Qingxuan! Kneel down!” ”
