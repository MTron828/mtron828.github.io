“”En.”Ye Zhaomu took out a document. “Oh right, President Zhao, this is our company’s offer. Take a look.” ”

Father Zhao took the offer and looked at it carefully. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Seeing that he did not speak for a long time, ye Zhaomu continued, “President Zhao, this is our first cooperation. If you are not satisfied with the price, you can still adjust it.” ”

“Father Zhao put down the price list. “There is no problem with the price, but I have to take the contract back and let the legal department study it.” ”

“Okay.”

“Father Zhao’s gaze inadvertently swept across ye Zhaomu’s desk. On the desk was a photo of a seven or eight-year-old boy. He continued, “Is that director Ye’s son?” ”

“Ye Zhaomu smiled and said, “Yes, that’s my son. He’s eight years old this year.” ”

Grandson!

He had a grandson!

That was his grandson!

The Zhao family had a descendant.

Father Zhao wished he could hug the photo and kiss it.

“Seeing Father Zhao like this, ye Zhaomu asked curiously, “Director Zhao, What’s Wrong?” ”

“”Nothing, nothing.”Father Zhao waved his hand. “I just like children.”But as he waved his hand, he accidentally knocked over the cup of water on the table. ”

Bang —

Ye Zhaomu was caught off guard and the water in the cup spilled all over his body.

“Father Zhao quickly stood up and wiped the water off ye Zhaomu’s sleeve. “Sorry, Sorry, President Ye. Did you burn yourself? Quickly roll up your sleeve.” ”

“”It’s fine, it’s fine, President Zhao. You Don’t have to be nervous,”ye Zhaomu said as she rolled up her sleeve. ”

It was bare.

“Ye Zhaomu’s arms were bare. Other than the marks of the tea being scalded red, there were no other marks at all. ”

“Seeing this scene, the light in Father Zhao’s eyes instantly disappeared. ”

No.

He was not Zhao Ziye.

This was not his son.

It was another futile effort.

Just how excited he was when he saw ye Zhaomu just now was how disappointed Father Zhao was now.

How could it not be?

Oh My God!

When will he be able to find his son? !

Father Zhao was on the verge of tears.

“The Butler saw that Father Zhao was not in a good condition and immediately put away the documents on the table. He then said, “President Zhao, it’s about time. We still have an important meeting in the afternoon.” ”

“After saying that, the butler turned to look at Ye Zhaomu. “President Ye, for other matters, we’ll contact you after we return to the company.” ”

Father Zhao followed the butler and walked out in a daze.

“Ye Zhaomu stood up and said, “Alright, I’ll send you out.” ”

“After sending the two of them downstairs, Ye Zhaomu walked back. ”

“Just as she walked into the house, a young woman walked out. “Zhaomu, how is it? Have you reached an agreement?” ”

“”It’s almost done,”ye Zhaomu said. ”

“”That’s good,”the young woman said with a smile. “It’s impossible for a small company like Yesen to compete with US for business.” ”

Ye Zhaomu rolled up her sleeves and put them down. Her eyes were filled with disdain. “Yesen? Who does he think he is? He will only bring shame to the ye family!”

“The young woman nodded. “You’re right, Zhaomu. I don’t think he deserves to be called Yesen!” ”

In the car.

Father Zhao covered his face and cried out loud.

“The Butler sat at the side and comforted father Zhao. “Master, don’t cry. Although we didn’t find young master this time, I believe that one day, we will find young master. Please don’t give up on yourself.” ”

Father Zhao was just worried that he would never be able to find Zhao Ziye again.

He was already in his seventies this year.

He did not know how many years he had left in his life.

“Can you still find him?”Father Zhao looked at the butler with red eyes.

“Seeing an old man in his 70s crying like this, the butler could not bear it and continued, “Yes, definitely! Look, even ye Langhua found his own daughter. You can definitely find young master.” ”

These words gave Father Zhao hope.

That’s right.

Even ye Langhua found her daughter.

How could he not find his son!

He could definitely find him.

“The butler continued, “It’s getting late. I heard that there’s a private house nearby that tastes very good. It just so happens that you haven’t eaten yet. Why Don’t you have a meal? You can take the opportunity to relax.” ”

“Okay.”Father Zhao nodded.

The Butler instructed the driver to start the car.

The city center was extremely congested.

“The journey, which should have taken ten minutes, took more than half an hour. ”

The private restaurant’s business was booming.

“The Butler had spent more than 200 yuan to find the scalper, so there was no need to queue. ”

“”Master, let’s go in quickly.” ”
