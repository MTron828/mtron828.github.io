Chapter 1663: 348: Miss Ye’s anger is very scary. Late stage of wife discipline! 6

Translator: 549690339

“Director ma continued, “Landing on Europa is a big matter. Master Five can listen to miss ye for small matters, but he definitely can’t do big things!”Director Ma had seen Cen Shaoqing’s methods before. He did not believe that Cen Shaoqing was a wife discipline.”

Wife discipline?

It did not exist!

“After saying that, director ma said, “Let’s give it a try! How do we know if we can do it if we don’t give it a try? What if master five agrees?””

“Professor Feng could only nod. “Alright, let’s give it a try then.””

The two of them walked all the way to Cen Shaoqing’s office.

“When they arrived, Cen Shaoqing was in a meeting. The secretary asked them to wait for about half an hour.”

The two of them could only wait outside the door.

“Soon, half an hour had passed.”

“The Secretary opened the door. “The two of you, master five wants you to enter.””

The two of them walked into the office.

“Cen Shaoqing was standing in front of the French window with his back facing the two of them. The setting sun had coated his body with a layer of golden light, and he was holding a string of Buddhist beads in his hand. Looking at him like this, he looked like a refined jade that was unattainable.”

“”Master Five,”director Ma was the first to speak.”

“”Speak,”Cen Shaoqing opened his thin lips.”

“Director ma continued, “Master Five, professor Feng and I have decided to carry out the plan to land on Europa, Europa. We hope that you can approve it.””

“Europa?”Cen Shaoqing raised his eyebrows slightly. “The Europa that is known as the small earth?”

“Yes.”Director ma nodded. “We have studied Europa for many years and have agreed that Europa is more suitable for human survival than Mars.”

“What did Miss Ye Say?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“Director Ma licked his lips and continued, “Miss Ye did not agree to the landing.””

“”Her opinion is my opinion. Since she doesn’t agree to log in, there’s no need for you to ask me again,”Cen Shaoqing said.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Director ma still didn’t want to give up, “Master Five, none of us, including Miss Ye, have logged into Europa, so we can’t label Europa.”. “I hope you can convince Miss Ye.”. “Let us land on Europa. Europa definitely has a lot of energy. If you don’t make a decision now, you’ll definitely regret it in the future.””

“”Miss Ye has her reasons for doing this.”Cen Shaoqing turned his eyes slightly, “Europa is 900 million kilometers away from us. No one knows what kind of risks are involved! If something happens, which one of you can bear the responsibility? Can you bear it or can professor Feng?””

“Director Ma wanted to say more, but was secretly stopped by Feng Zhan.”

“Professor Feng continued, “Since master five and Miss Ye have the same intention, then you can pretend that we didn’t come today! We’ll leave First!””

Cen Shaoqing waved his hand.

Professor Feng pulled director Ma out of the office.

Director Ma was very depressed!

He didn’t expect Cen Shaoqing to be so strict with his wife.

“If ye Zhuo did not want to go, he would not let him go!”

“Does master five not have his own opinions?”Director ma said indignantly.

“Professor Feng had an expression that she had long known. He continued, “I’ve already told you that as long as Miss Ye does not agree, master five will definitely not agree. If you don’t believe me, what can I Do?””

Director ma sighed. “Then what should we do now?”

“I don’t know!”Professor Feng Sighed. “I hope that miss ye can think it through and lead us to Europa.”

Let Ye Zhuo think it through on her own?

How Long would that take?

“Director ma said, “If Miss Ye doesn’t think it through, won’t we never be able to land in Europa?””

“In his opinion, Ye Zhuo did it on purpose.”

“She deliberately said that Europa was dangerous, and she wanted to prove her ability by not letting them land on Europa.”

No.

“Even if ye Zao didn’t agree, he couldn’t give up on landing on Europa. He had to prove to Cen Shaoqing, Ye Zao, and the other people in the base that his idea was not wrong. Europa was a habitable planet!”

“Thinking of this, director Ma narrowed his eyes, and a bright light flashed in his eyes.”

On the other side.

In the laboratory.

“Ye Zhuo was wearing an isolation suit as she sat under the analyzer to study the Martian soil. She discovered that the Martian soil was not completely sandy, and the content of the elements in it was far higher than the Earth’s soil.”

“The density was very high, and the iron content ratio was also higher than normal soil. There were magnesium sulfate, iron oxide, and carbonate in it!”

“However, no organic substances were detected.”

Ye Zhuo frowned slightly. This was not quite what she had imagined.

“In her previous life, she had not participated in the Mars research project. Before she left, Mars had not succeeded in creating an oasis.”

“The reason why ye Zhuo was so obsessed with the Mars project was partly to develop interstellar tourism, and partly to fulfill the last wish of her teacher.”

“Ye Zao’s teacher was a very talented person. His lifelong wish was to prove to everyone that Mars was not an abandoned planet. On Mars, there was an oasis that could be developed to benefit mankind.”

Unfortunately.

“In the end, not only did his teacher fail to fulfill this wish, he ended up with an unfavorable ending.”

“Thinking of his teacher, ye Zao’s expression darkened a little.”

“”Miss Ye.”At this moment, Tang Mi walked in from outside.”

“”What’s Wrong?”Ye Zhuo looked back slightly. However, in the blink of an eye, no expression could be seen on her face.”

“One in front and one in the back, they were two completely different people.”

“Tang mi continued, “Miss Ye, this is the test report of Mars’Magma. Please take a look.””

“Unlike Earth, the surface of Mars was surrounded by many active volcanoes. In order to turn Mars into an oasis, not only did they have to solve the problem of soil and water, but they also had to solve the problem of volcanoes.”

Ye Zhuo took the report and read it carefully. Her beautiful brows furrowed slightly.

“Ten minutes later, Ye Zhuo left the laboratory and went to the aircraft carrier.”

Yu Zifei and the others were preparing to land on Mars.

“Miss Ye.”Cen Jiang jogged over.

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “When will you set off?”

“”In ten minutes,”Cen Jiang said.”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “I’ll go with you.””

“After saying that, she pressed the switch on her arm. In an instant, the clothes on her body turned into a handsome Martian suit!”

Mars had no oxygen to keep up. They needed the Martian suit on the bed in order to walk normally.

“Seeing ye Zao like this, Cen Jiang asked in puzzlement, “Miss Ye, did something happen?””

“Ye Zao said, “I want to go up personally to take a look. By the way, where is the login point this time?””

Cen Jiang took out his phone and showed the coordinates to ye Zao.

“Ye Zao took a look and then zoomed in on the map. He pointed at one of the coordinates and said, “Change the landing point to here.””

“Cen Jiang nodded. “Alright, then I’ll go and reset the route now.””

“Go.”Ye Zao walked into the cabin.

“”Miss Ye, why are you here?”Cen he was a little surprised when he saw ye Zao Board the aircraft carrier.”

“Ye Zao said, “I’ll go with you to Mars to take a look.””

“OH.”Cen he nodded.

“Ten minutes later, the aircraft carrier set off.”

Mars was not far from Earth. It would only take half an hour to get there by an aircraft carrier.

“According to the coordinates given by ye Zao, the aircraft carrier successfully landed in the volcanic zone.”

“Standing on the runway of the aircraft carrier, one could clearly see that there was a volcano erupting not far away.”

“Telescope.”Ye Zao extended his hand.

The assistant immediately handed the silent telescope to Ye Zao.

“A few minutes later, ye Zao returned the telescope to the assistant and opened his red lips slightly. “I’ll go over for a while. You guys wait for me at the same place.””

“After all, they were on Mars. The assistant was a little worried and said, “Miss Ye, shall I go with you?””

“No need.”Ye Zao opened the door of the small aircraft. “Just wait at the same place.”
