“Speaking up to this point, the old man paused, then he continued, “Furthermore, even if any accidents happen, with you young people around, there’s hope. What’s the use of keeping us old people around? We Can’t take care of our children, and we have to let others take care of us...” ”

“These words were very sad, making people cry. ”

“”Therefore, young people, the most important thing for you now is to take good care of yourselves! As long as you’re around, there’s still hope!” ”

These old people resolutely stood at the outermost point.

“They stood guard over the young people, with the children in the middle. ”

“In fact, the old people were the group that should be protected the most. ”

“When they were young, they had devoted their most precious time to their children and work. It wasn’t easy for them to reach the time of their retirement, yet they had to face this. ”

“Seeing this scene, Mario immediately burst into tears. Taking off his glasses, he wiped his tears, once again regretting why he had been so arrogant back then. If it wasn’t for him, the L continent wouldn’t have to face this. ”

“When everything was settled, he would definitely give everyone an explanation. ”

Another five minutes passed.

The central plaza was completely silent.

“At this time, it was already 15 minutes since they had gathered. ”

“However, they did not see ye Zao come over. William also did not receive any news from ye Zao. ”

“After all, it was a matter of life and death. It was inevitable that there would be suspicion in the crowd. ”

“Is Dr. YC not coming?”

“There are only five minutes left.”

“Will we die here today?”

“Everyone held each other’s hands tightly, looking for comfort. ”

William was also a little anxious.

That was because he could not contact ye Zao.

Where had ye Zao Gone?

“William turned to look at Mario and continued, “I can’t contact Miss Ye. What should we do now?” ”

He was already beginning to suspect that ye Zao was lying to them.

“Thinking about it carefully, it was not surprising that ye Zao would lie to them. ”

“After all, they were the ones who had bitten Lu Dongbin back then and did not appreciate the kindness of the people. ”

“Therefore, ye Zao wanted to take revenge on them. ”

“Thinking of this, William continued, “Let’s get everyone out of here quickly.” ”

“If ye Zao came, they had a 50% chance of surviving. ”

“But if ye Zao did not come, they would be like sheep in the tiger’s mouth and would definitely die! ”

There were only three minutes left until the agreed time.

Ye Zao would definitely not appear.

“If ye Zao really came, he would have come long ago. He wouldn’t have waited until now. ”

William had already given up.

“”No, that won’t happen.”Mario’s expression was resolute. “Miss Ye will definitely not lie to us!” ”

He believed in ye Zao.

Looks were born from the heart.

“If ye Zao was really lying to them, there was no need for him to talk so much nonsense with them. ”

“”Mario!”Seeing Mario like this, William was a little anxious. ”

Mario trusted ye Zao too much.

“If ye Zao was lying to them, it would cost over 100,000 lives! ” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

It wasn’t worth it!

“Mario looked at William. “I’ve already missed it once. This time, I definitely won’t Be Wrong Again!” ”

William frowned slightly. “But Miss Ye...”

There were only two minutes left.

What About Ye Zao?

Ye Zao still hadn’t appeared.

“It wasn’t that he didn’t believe ye Zao, but the truth was already laid out before his eyes. ”

“If ye Zao still hadn’t come, there would only be one way to face them. ”

To be eaten.

It was very cruel.

But this was the truth.

“”Miss Ye will definitely come,”Mario said. ”

William looked at his watch. “But there’s only one minute left.”

“As William said this, he raised his head to look at the sky. ”

“The Blue Sky was as clear as jade. It didn’t seem to be any different from the usual sky, but it also seemed a little different. ”

It was always quiet before a storm.

This kind of sky seemed to be hiding something.

Dong Dong Dong.

“At this moment, a deafening sound suddenly rang in his ears. ”

It was the voice of a strange beast.

William’s expression changed.

It was coming.

They were coming.

But Ye Zao still did not appear.

What should they do now?

The people standing in the central square were also very nervous. Their palms were covered with layers and layers of cold sweat.

They looked at the sky expectantly.

“However, other than a few clouds, there was nothing else in the sky. ”

“There were no flying devices, nor was there the Miss ye that they were looking forward to. ”

Should they run?

“Right now, the exotic beast was still about a kilometer or two away from them. If they ran, there should still be time. ”

“Just as everyone was hesitating, Mario suddenly spoke, “There are still 30 seconds left before the agreed time. We have to believe in Miss Ye! We have to hold out until the very last moment!” ”
