“Then, old master Yang ordered the servants to make tea. ”

“Yang Danian came down from upstairs. When he saw ye Zhuo, he walked over respectfully. “Miss Ye!” ”

“When he thought of the doubt he had when he met ye Zhuo for the first time, Yang Danian was filled with regret. ”

“At that time, he thought that ye Zhuo was a liar and that ye Zhuo would definitely not be able to cure Old Master Yang. ” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“He did not expect that Old Master Yang, who had already been sentenced to death by the doctor, had actually recovered! ”

Yang Danian was now really convinced by ye Zao!

“”Uncle Yang,”ye Zao greeted politely. ”

“Yang Danian was a little embarrassed. “Miss Ye, please take a seat.” ”

Old Master Yang looked at Yang Danian. “Where’s your wife? Don’t you know that there are guests at home?”

He and Yang Danian were both men.

Grandfather Yang was afraid that ye Zao would feel uncomfortable.

“At times like this, a woman was still needed. ”

“Yang Danian said, “I’ll go get Yazi right away.” ”

“Not long after, Yang Danian brought Wu Yazi down. ”

“Wu Yazi was a very standard noblewoman. Even at home, she was dressed very neatly and had exquisite makeup on her face. When she saw ye Zao, she held her hand very intimately, “This is Zao Zao, right? I’ve heard so much about you from the old man. It’s better to see you than to hear so much about you! Zao Zao, you’re So Beautiful!” ”

“Wu Yazi had three sons in a row, but she did not have a daughter. Seeing ye Zao was a rare sight. ”

“If this was her daughter, she would be able to wake up from her dream with a smile. ”

Ye Zao greeted her politely.

“Wu Yazi took the opportunity to take the bracelet off her hand and put it on ye Zao’s. “Zao Zao, this is the first time Auntie has seen you. There’s nothing much to give. This bracelet will be your welcome gift.” ”

“”Auntie, this is too expensive, I can’t accept it.”Ye Zao quickly rejected. ”

“Wu Yazi pressed down on ye Zao’s hand. “Zao Zao, if you don’t accept it, you’re looking down on Auntie!” ”

“Having said that, ye Zao had no choice but to accept it. ”

“Seeing that ye Zao had accepted the table, Wu Yazi heaved a sigh of relief and continued, “I heard from the old man that Zao Zao, you’re the top scorer in Yun Jing’s College Entrance Examination, right?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded.

“Wu Yazi said in surprise, “Zhuo Zhuo, you’re really too smart! You’re not like those three brats from my family who always count backwards! I’m so angry that my liver hurts! Tell me, how did you brainpower?” ”

“Good-looking, good medical skills, and good academic results. ”

This little girl was really amazing!

Ye Zhuo stayed at the Yang residence until evening before returning.

Old Master Yang suggested that the chauffeur send her off.

“Ye Zao smiled and declined. “Grandpa Yang, there’s no need to go through so much trouble. A friend is coming to pick me up.” ”

“Wu Yazi teased, “It must be a man, right?” ”

Ye Zao nodded.

She could not deny this.

“Is he pursuing you?”Wu Yazi Winked at Ye Zao.

“”No,”ye Zao denied, “He and I are very good friends.” ”

“OH.”Wu Yazi nodded meaningfully. “I understand!”

“After bidding farewell to the Yang family, ye Zhuo arrived outside the manor. ”

A black car was parked outside the manor.

Cen Shaoqing was leaning against the car door.

He was holding a string of Buddhist beads in his hand.

“Ye Zhuo jogged over. “You’ve been waiting for a long time, haven’t you?” ”

Cen Shaoqing opened the door of the passenger seat. “I just arrived.”

Ye Zao sat in the passenger seat.

Cen Shaoqing went around to the driver’s seat as well. “I’ve already gotten my assistant to book the tickets. We’ll set off at 10 am tomorrow.”

“Ye Zao nodded. “Alright, I’ll transfer you the money.” ”

Cen Shaoqing knew ye Zao’s personality.

“If he said that he didn’t want the money, it would only alienate ye Zao from him. ”

She was never a person who took advantage of others.

“5200 yuan.”

He booked first class.

“Ye Zhuo opened wechat and transferred the money to Cen Shaoqing. “By the way, I saw on the Internet that there’s a night market nearby that’s particularly lively. Why don’t we go and take a look?” ”

“Sure.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “What’s the address?”

Ye Zhuo switched his phone to navigation mode and placed it in front of the car. “Follow the navigation.”

“Soon, they arrived at the night market. ”

This night market was the largest night market in Beijing.

The night market was full of people.

“There were all kinds of food, drinks, and fun. ”

Ye Zhuo bought some gadgets and then dragged Cen Shaoqing to eat skewers.

The sanitation of the roadside stalls was really unbearable to watch.

But Cen Shaoqing still sat on the stool as if nothing had happened and ordered some vegetarian dishes.

“If others were to see this scene, they would definitely be shocked. ”

“Cen Wuye, who had always been high and mighty, had never eaten roadside stalls in such a down-to-earth manner? ”

“Moreover, he was squeezed together with so many people! ”

...

“In the blink of an eye, the next day arrived. ”
