“”It’s fine.”As soon as he finished speaking, ye Zhuo’s gaze swept past Wu Jiaguo and continued, “Deal with it.” ”

“”Alright, leave everything to me.” ”

“Ye Zhuo nodded slightly, stood up, and walked out. ”

“The tall man gave Qian Youlong a look. Qian Youlong immediately understood and immediately said, “Miss Ye, I’ll send you off.” ”

“No need.”Ye Zhuo’s tone was cold.

Qian Youlong had no choice but to stop and walk back.

Ye Zhuo was not there.

The Interrogation Room was dead silent.

“Wu Jiaguo lay limply on the ground, his face devoid of any color. ”

He was extremely uncomfortable.

How could he have known that such a small matter would involve such great trouble.

But what was the use of regretting now?

On the other side.

Ye Zhuo drove to the entrance of the examination hall.

It was getting late.

“Not long after she arrived, it was time for the examination to end. ”

The examinees walked out from inside.

“On their youthful and beautiful faces, some were smiling, some were crying, and from their expressions, one could tell the difficulty of this year’s examination papers. ”

Ye Zhuo’s indifferent chair was beside the car.

Lin Sha jogged out of the car. “Zao Zao!”

“Sister Sha Sha.”

“Lin Sha asked with concern, “How is it? Are you okay? Did they make things difficult for you?” ”

“”Don’t worry, they didn’t,”ye Zao said. ”

“That’s good.”

Zou Feifei had just walked out of the school when he saw this scene.

That... that was ye Zao and Lin Sha?

How could that be?

Wu Jiaguo had clearly promised her that he would deal with the two of them.

Could it be that Wu Jiaguo had forgotten?

“Zou feifei frowned and took out her phone to call Zou’s mother, “Mom, what’s going on with my Godfather? Didn’t he promise me that he would deal with Ye Zhuo and Lin Sha? Why are the two of them still standing at the entrance of the Examination Hall? What on Earth is going on?” ”

“Zou’s mother was also very surprised. “Feifei, don’t worry. I’ll call him to ask.” ”

“After hanging up, Zou’s mother immediately called Wu Jiaguo. ”

“The call was quickly connected, but Wu Jiaguo did not pick up. ”

Something did not seem right!

“Usually, when she called Wu Jiaguo, Wu Jiaguo would pick up immediately. ”

What happened today?

Mother Zou dialed again.

He still didn’t pick up.

Could he have gone to a meeting?

“After hanging up, mother Zou called Wu Jiaguo’s office again. ”

The call went through very quickly.

“”Hello, I’m looking for team leader Wu.” ”

“”Team leader Wu?”The other side was stunned for a moment and then said, “I’m sorry, Madam, you have the wrong number. We don’t have team leader Wu here.” ”

No team leader Wu?

Wrong Number?

Zou’s mother frowned slightly and looked down at her phone.

That’s right.

She didn’t dial the wrong number.

It was this phone number.

“”I’m not mistaken,”Zou’s mother continued, “You’re new here, right? You Don’t Even Know Your Team Leader’s surname?” ”

“”I’m sorry, our team leader’s surname is Yin!” ” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Surname Yin?

How was that possible!

Zou’s mother vaguely felt that something was wrong.

“”Your team leader’s name is Wu Jiaguo! Quickly get me team leader Wu, or I’ll make him fire you!”Mother Zou said. ”

“”I’m sorry, Ma’am, our team leader’s surname is Yin.”After saying that, the other side hung up. ”

Mother Zou was very confused and immediately logged onto the official website to check.

“But when she saw the name on the official website, she was immediately stunned. ”

Yin Shaojie?

Who Was Yin Shaojie?

“If Yin Shaojie became the new team leader, then where did Wu Jiaguo go? ”

Did he disappear into thin air?

What on Earth happened!

They had clearly spoken on the phone a minute ago!

“Mother Zou did not believe it and continued to call Wu Jiaguo, but no one picked up. ”

“At this moment, footsteps came from outside the door. ”

“Mother Zou looked back and saw that it was Zou Feifei’s father, Zou minglang. ”

“”Minglang, you’re back!”Mother Zou seemed to have found her backbone and continued, “I don’t know what happened to Feifei’s godfather...” ”

PA —

“Before mother Zou could finish her sentence, Zou minglang slapped her. ”

“With great strength, half of mother Zou’s face instantly swelled up. ”

“Zou’s mother covered her face and was close to shouting hysterically, “Zou minglang! Are you crazy or are you raising a woman outside! Why did you hit me?” ”

“Zou minglang’s expression was extremely ugly. He threw the document in his hand on the ground, “Look! Look! Look at what you mother and daughter have done! I have already told you that a tall tree attracts the wind. You must keep a low profile! When have you ever listened to My Words?” ”

“Mother Zou covered her face with one hand and picked up the documents on the ground with the other. When she saw the words on the documents clearly, she was stunned. ”

Mother Zou’s face turned pale. “What’s going on?”

“What’s going on! You still have the face to ask me what’s Going On!”Zou minglang raised his hand and slapped again. “Do you know who you have offended? Miss Ye!”

“At this moment, mother Zou couldn’t care less about the pain. ”

Miss Ye?

Who Was Miss Ye?

When did they offend Miss Ye?

“At this moment, mother Zou suddenly thought of a name. ”

Ye Zhuo!

Could It Be... Ye Zhuo?

“Thinking of this, mother Zou’s red and swollen face was filled with shock. She continued, “Then what about Fei Fei’s godfather?” ”

Could it be that Wu Jiaguo’s name suddenly disappeared from the official website because of Ye Zhuo?

That shouldn’t be the case!

What was going on?

“You still have the nerve to mention brother Wu! Brother Wu was also ruined by the two of you! Can’t you see that Yin Shaojie is now taking over brother Wu’s position?”

In that case.

Wu Jiaguo was...

Boom!

“When she realized this problem, mother Zou was struck by lightning. She collapsed to the ground, unable to muster any strength. ”

“”Mom, Dad, you’re home!”Zou feifei walked in from outside, she said with some annoyance, “Godfather, What’s going on? You clearly promised me. Why did you go back on your word? Mom, did you call Godfather?” ”

No one responded to Zou Feifei’s words in the air.

“Zou Feifei took a step forward and saw mother Zou kneeling on the ground, she frowned and said, “Mom, what happened to you? Did you quarrel with my dad? I don’t care what happened between you two! Hurry up and solve my problem! That Little B * Tch, Ye Zhuo, is really too hateful! “This time, I must let her know how powerful I am!” ”

“”Mom, did you hear me?” ”

“At this moment, Zou minglang walked over and slapped Zou Feifei’s face. “Shut up! It’s all your fault! The family is unlucky! The family is unlucky! How could I give birth to a daughter like you!” ”

“Zou Feifei was stunned by the slap. She looked at Zou minglang and said, “Dad, you hit me! You actually hit me!” ”

“Zou’s mother rushed over and hugged Zou feifei. She cried, “Feifei, it’s over, we’re finished!” ”

“Seeing Zou’s mother like this, Zou Feifei was also a little flustered. “Mom! Mom, what happened? What happened to your face? It was also my dad who hit you? What exactly happened? Quickly tell me!” ”

Zou’s mother cried as she told her the whole story.

Zou Feifei’s face was full of disbelief.

Miss Ye?

Ye Zhuo?

Zou Feifei never expected that ye Zhuo’s background was actually so powerful! Even Wu Jiaguo could do something to her!

What should she do now?

“”Divorce! We’ll get a divorce right now!”Just when Zou Feifei hadn’t reacted.., zou minglang took out the divorce agreement and threw it in front of Zou’s mother. “Sign the divorce agreement! From now on, this evil daughter belongs to you! It has nothing to do with me!” ”
