“Cen Yuyan continued, “Moreover, don’t you think it’s weird? I heard from my third sister that my fifth brother didn’t like ye Zao at the beginning. It was my grandmother who insisted on matchmaking the two of them! “Later, for some unknown reason, my fifth brother suddenly agreed to be together with ye Zao! “I guess it must be ye Zao who is persistent in pursuing my fifth brother! “Otherwise, my fifth brother wouldn’t have suddenly fallen in love!” ”

“In the past, CEN Yuyan felt that the only person who could change Cen Shaoqing was song Chenyu, so she introduced song Chenyu to Zhou Xiang. ”

She also often brought song Chenyu to the Cen family for free meals.

“Reality proved that song Chenyu was indeed likable, and Zhou Xiang was very satisfied with her. ”

“Who would have thought that after a trip to Yun capital, all of this would change. ”

Song Chenyu frowned slightly. “I heard that Fifth Master Cen was an anti-marriage activist in the past. Is this true?”

Cen Yuyan nodded.

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “This can only mean that miss ye is very charming and has moved fifth master Cen’s heart greatly.” ”

“Cen Yuyan narrowed her eyes, “Who knows what she has done? “My fifth brother’s conditions are so good that those who want to marry him can line up from four or nine cities to Persia! “Ye Zhuo must have taken a fancy to our Cen family’s power! “My fifth brother has never been in a relationship before, he doesn’t even know that he’s been deceived!” ” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Song Chenyu patted Cen Yuyan’s back. “Do you think this is a movie? Think of the good in everything. I Won’t talk to you anymore, time is running out.” ”

“After saying this, song Chenyu took out a mask and sunglasses from his backpack and put them on. ”

Being a celebrity was this bit of trouble.

“No matter where he went, he would cause a sensation. ”

“Even in a luxurious manor, he might encounter fanatical fans. ”

“After taking a few steps, song Chenyu seemed to have suddenly thought of something. He turned to CEN Yuyan and said, “Yuyan, ZY company will be launching a limited edition event at 8 pm tonight. Don’t forget about it.” ”

“The temperature-adjustable air-conditioning clothes produced by ZY Technology Limited had become popular all over the world. Now, everyone in the industry was proud of owning a limited edition ZY dress. ”

“Unfortunately, limited edition clothes were too hard to get. Every time they were just released, it would take less than a second. ”

Cen Yuyan nodded. “I remember it all.”

“Song Chenyu continued, “I’ve already asked my manager to contact ZY’s chief designer, Z. If we can make an appointment with him, we can get him to design a pair of matching outfits for the two of us.” ”

“Cen Yuyan smiled and said, “Let’s talk about it if we can make an appointment. I heard that Z only takes five pictures a year.” ”

“I’ll contact you if the appointment is successful.”Song Chenyu waved at Cen Yuyan and walked out of the manor.

Song Chenyu’s nanny car stopped at the entrance of the Cen family’s manor.

They got into the car.

Song Chenyu took off his sunglasses and mask. “Let’s go to the office.”

“Okay.”His assistant nodded and instructed the driver to go to the office.

Song Chenyu took out his phone.

The assistant was watching the subwoofer short video.

Song Chenyu looked up and saw a familiar figure on the screen.

That Was?

Ye Zhuo?

“What video are you watching?”Song Chenyu asked.

“The assistant was stunned for a moment before answering, “This is the edited video of last year’s subwoofer’s Third Anniversary Party.” ”

“Who is that person?”

“The assistant was a fervent fan of ye Zao. When he heard this, he said very excitedly, “This is the wonderful sound platform’s live streamer, Sitara YC’s Ye! Ye Zao usually doesn’t show his face during live broadcasts. This is the only time he shows his face.” ”

Live Streamer?

Song Chenyu frowned.

Was he the live streamer who was twisting and turning in front of the camera to flatter the crowd?

No Wonder Ye Zao was so good-looking.

So he was a live streamer.

Song Chenyu suddenly did not understand why the dignified CEN fifth master would like a live streamer.

On the other side.

The Cen family.

“After receiving the warning from the CEN old lady, Cen Yuyan restrained herself a lot. ”

“After dinner, the three Cen Sisters, the Cen Old Lady, and Zhou Xiang were chatting with ye Zao. ”

“The few women were chatting very happily together, and laughter could be heard from time to time. ”

“Cen Yueya asked the servants to bring over the gifts that she had prepared earlier, “Zha Zha, this is the welcome gift that I prepared for you. The items are a little too little, but you must not despise it. If you want to blame someone, blame Shaoqing. I asked him what you like, but he refused to say a word.” ”

Ye Zha turned his head to look at the items that the two servants had brought over. He was almost blinded by the dazzling sight of diamonds.

“Not only were there diamonds, there were also sets of lipstick, high-end skincare products, face masks... ”

This was called a little too little?

“”Second sister, you are too polite. This is the first time we have met. I can’t accept such an expensive thing from you.” ”

“Cen Yueya’s face was stern. “Zao Zao! You must accept it today! If you don’t accept it, you are looking down on me, your second sister!” ”
