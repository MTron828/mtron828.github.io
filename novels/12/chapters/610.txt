“Learning from the previous lesson, Bai Xiaoman quickly took out her phone from her pocket and took a photo of this scene. ”

“After taking the photo, Bai Xiaoman quickly ran in the direction of the dormitory. ”

“The dormitory building was more than ten minutes away from here, Bai Xiaoman only used eight minutes to run there. ”

This dormitory was full of finance students.

“Because Feng Xianxian was the eldest daughter of the Lin family, the other two roommates were like Bai Xiaoman, fawning over Feng Xianxian everywhere. Here, Feng Xianxian found the sense of superiority of the eldest daughter of the Lin family again! ”

“Seeing Bai Xiaoman rush in, Feng Xianxian frowned and said, “Why are you so flustered?” ”

“Bai Xiaoman was running out of breath. “Xian, Xianxian, you… Guess What I saw?” ”

“What did you see?”Feng Xianxian asked.

“Bai Xiaoman continued, “I saw ye Zao’s boyfriend! It’s that old man from last time!” ”

“Hearing that, Feng Xianxian’s eyes lit up. “Did you take a photo?” ”

“Yes!”Bai Xiaoman nodded.

“Feng Xianxian said impatiently, “Take it out and let me see!” ”

Bai Xiaoman took out her phone.

Feng Xianxian took the phone and zoomed in on it. Her eyes were filled with excitement.

That’s right!

This was ye Zao’s boyfriend.

Feng Xianxian thought that ye Zao had already broken up with this old man.

“After all, Ye Zao was now the eldest daughter of the Lin family. ”

She did not expect that ye Zao would still continue with him.

It seemed that this old man’s background was definitely not simple.

“Perhaps, he was also someone from the science and Technology World. ” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ye Zao’s phd status was created by this old man!

“Otherwise, just based on Ye Zao, how could she be so powerful? ”

She was only nineteen years old and already became a phd?

Feng Xianxian had suspected ye Zao from the start.

But she did not expect ye Zao to rely on a man.

Tsk.

How Shameless.

Thinking of this.

“Feng Xianxian narrowed her eyes and continued, “Xiaoman, send the photo to my wechat.” ”

“Okay.”Bai Xiaoman nodded and sent the photo to Feng Xianxian.

Feng Xianxian took out a necklace from the jewelry box. “This is for you. Help me pay more attention to ye Zao’s condition in the future.”

This necklace was a limited edition from a famous luxury brand.

“Even if you had money, you might not be able to buy it. ”

“Bai Xiaoman did not expect Feng Xianxian to give it to her just like that. She was very excited. “Xianxian, don’t worry. If anything happens to ye Zao in the future, I will definitely tell you immediately.” ”

Feng Xianxian nodded.

“After returning to the Feng family from school, Feng Xianxian immediately told Feng Qianhua about this matter. ”

“Hearing this, Feng Qianhua narrowed her eyes. “Are you sure?” ”

“Feng Qianqian nodded her head with certainty, “When I was staying in the same dormitory as ye Zao, ye Zao personally admitted that this old man was her boyfriend! “At that time, ye Zao had not been found by the Lin family. I thought that ye Zao was just trying to hook up with a rich man. Now, it seems that this old man’s identity is definitely not simple!” ”

“However, even if he was not simple, he was still an old man. ”

Someone who was on the same generation as Old Lady Lin could already be ye Zao’s grandfather!

Wouldn’t it be embarrassing if this news spread?

“Moreover, the Lin family had just spread the news that ye Zao was Doctor YC. If they were to find out that ye Zao had relied on a man to get to the top, how could the Lin family raise their head among the wealthy families? ”

“Feng Xianxian pulled out the photo on her phone and handed it to Feng Qianhua. “Mom, look, it’s this old man!” ”

Feng Qianhua looked down at her phone.

“From the photo, this old man was indeed not young. ”

It seemed that the kind of mother had the kind of daughter.

Ye Shu was a vixen who stole someone else’s fiancé.

Ye Zao was also a vixen who destroyed other people’s families.

“Judging from the old man’s age, he must have a family already. ”

The dignified eldest daughter of the Lin family was actually a mistress?

Interesting!

Really Interesting!

“Feng Qianqian continued, “Mom, I suspect that this old man is from the technology industry. Otherwise, ye Zao wouldn’t be able to sit on the position of a doctor!” ”

Feng Qianhua narrowed her eyes. She felt that Feng Qianhua was right.

“After all, Ye Zao was inferior to Feng Qianhua in every aspect. ”

How could ye Zao achieve so much in the science and technology industry?

Doctor YC?

She saw that ye Zao wasn’t even qualified to serve the doctor foot-washing water.

Feng Qianhua smiled. “Don’t go to the violin class tomorrow morning. Come with me to deliver soup to your grandmother.”

“Okay.”Feng Xianxian instantly understood Feng Qianhua’s intention.
