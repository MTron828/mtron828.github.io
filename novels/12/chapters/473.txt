She just couldn’t accept it.

She couldn’t accept losing to ye Shu just like that.

She was born into a wealthy family and had been a rich young lady since she was young. She received the best education.

How could that B * Tch ye Shu compare to her?

“In the beginning, she was Lin Jin city’s fiancée. ”

It was ye Shu who was shameless and stole everything from her!

She had to take back everything that belonged to her.

“”You mean, as long as the knot in your heart is untied, president Lin will be able to return to normal?” ”

Doctor an nodded. “You can say that.”

“”Okay, then I understand.”Feng Qianhua took out a red packet from her bag. “Doctor an, thank you. In the future, President Lin’s health will continue to depend on you.” ”

“”Ms. Feng, you’re too kind.”Doctor an refused to accept Feng Qianhua’s red packet. ”

“Feng Qianhua directly put the red packet on the desk, then turned around and left. ”

“After Feng Qianhua left, doctor an opened the red packet. ”

Inside was a six-figure cheque.

“Feng Qianhua came to Lin Jin city’s ward. This time, the bodyguard did not stop her. ”

A glimmer of light flashed in Feng Qianhua’s eyes.

It seemed that the diary really played a big role.

“Although the bodyguard did not stop her, Feng Qianhua still knocked on the door. ”

“Come in.”Lin Jin Cheng’s voice came from inside.

“Feng Qianhua pushed the door open and went in. “Brother Jin Cheng, are you feeling better today?” ”

“Lin Jin Cheng put down the newspaper. “I’m fine, don’t worry.” ”

“Feng Qianhua put her bag on the coffee table. “Brother Jin Cheng, I know that you’ve always misunderstood me. Actually, in the past nineteen years, I’ve already thought it through. Two people who love each other don’t have to be together to be happy.” ”

“I know that Aunt Lin came to see you this morning. Please don’t feel pressured because of this. I’ve never thought of making you take responsibility because I did all this on my own!”

“I’ll explain to Aunt Lin.”

Feng Qianhua had known Lin Jin Cheng for 40 years.

No one knew Lin Jin Cheng better than her.

She knew what to do to Lower Lin Jin Cheng’s guard.

Lin Jincheng had lost that memory.

She could take advantage of it and let Lin Jincheng know a new version of herself.

That was why Feng Qianhua used a roundabout tactic of retreating in order to advance.

It turned out that she had done the right thing!

“Lin Jincheng had thought that Feng Qianhua came here with the same attitude as Old Lady Lin, which was to force a marriage. ”

But Feng Qianhua said something like this.

Lin Jin Cheng couldn’t figure it out.

Could it be…

That everything in the diary was true?

“For a moment, Lin Jin Cheng fell into deep thought. ”

“Feng Qianhua saw that the fire was almost ready, so she stood up. “Brother Jin Cheng, I Won’t disturb you any longer. Take good care of yourself and don’t let your imagination run wild.” ”

“After saying that, she turned around and left. ”

“She had to put on a good show, so Feng Qianhua went straight to the Lin family. ”

“Seeing Feng Qianhua come over, Old Madam Lin was very happy. “Qianhua is here.” ”

“Feng Qianhua walked to Old Madam Lin’s side. “Aunt Lin, I want to discuss something with you. Please promise me.” ”

“Old Madam Lin said with a smile, “Qianhua, you can just say it directly. We’re mother and daughter. What else is there to promise or Not?” ”

“”Aunt Lin, I want you to help brother Jin Cheng and sister Ye Shu succeed!”saying that, Feng Qianhua directly knelt down to old madam Lin. ”

“Old Lady Lin was shocked and quickly helped Feng Qianhua up. “Qianhua! You Silly Child, what are you thinking about? What do you mean by helping them? In My Heart, only you are worthy of Jin Cheng!” ”

“”Ye Shu is not only a promiscuous woman, but also a Jinx! If it weren’t for her, Jin Cheng wouldn’t have become like this! Not only did she cheat on Jin Cheng, but she also harmed him for the rest of his life!” ”

“Back then, Lin Jin city ignored Old Lady Lin’s objections and insisted on being together with Ye Shu. ”

“After Old Lady Lin learned of this, she locked Lin Jin city up at home and sent people to watch over him. ”

“But for some reason, Lin Jin city still learned of the news of ye Shu’s birth. ”

Lin Jin city threatened her with death and drove to Yun Jing overnight.

“Unexpectedly, there was only a car accident on the road. ”

“When her son was in an accident, as the matriarch of the Lin family, Old Lady Lin would not disregard the life and death of her grandson no matter how hard-hearted she was. Thus, she bribed the midwife and carried away the newly born Lin Ze. ”

“Every time she thought of this, Old Lady Lin would feel a lingering fear. ”

“Fortunately, she had gone early back then and that little bastard had yet to be born. ”

“Otherwise, wouldn’t the Lin family have to raise a bastard for nineteen years? ”

“So, this was all ye Shu’s fault! ”

“If not for ye Shu’s words, Lin Jincheng, who had always listened to her, wouldn’t have become so rebellious. He actually dared to threaten his mother with death! ”
