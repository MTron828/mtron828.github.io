“Song Shiyu said slowly, “When are you planning to go back?” ”

“Ye Zhuo said, “I booked a plane ticket for tomorrow. What About You?” ”

“The project here hasn’t been settled yet. I’m not sure yet.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Project?

What Project Here!

“When their boss told a lie, his face didn’t turn red and his heart didn’t skip a beat. ”

His assistant had been by song Shiyu’s side for more than half a year.

He had never seen song Shiyu get so close to a girl before.

“Even Chen Siyan, who was behind song Shiyu, found it difficult to get a smile from Song Shiyu. ”

“In the past, he had always thought that song Shiyu was the kind of person who would not be moved. ”

One had to know that Chen Siyan was a great beauty.

He turned a blind eye to Chen Siyan’s likes.

Now it seemed that he just hadn’t met the right person.

“In front of this miss ye, Song Shiyu seemed to have changed into a completely different person. ”

It was just that.

This miss ye was obviously not the same person as Chen Siyan.

“If it was Chen Siyan, song Shiyu would have been so humble that Chen Siyan would have long fainted from joy. ”

But this miss ye did not.

“Although he was just a bystander, he could tell that this miss ye did not have any feelings for song Shiyu at all. As for Song Shiyu? He was trying his best to control his emotions. ”

He was afraid.

“Thinking of this, the assistant was a little confused. ”

“As the song family’s third master, what did he want? When had he ever let himself be wronged? ”

“However, song Shiyu seemed to be afraid that this miss ye would see through his intentions. ”

Shouldn’t he just say that he liked her?

“Perhaps, he had seen wrongly? ”

Song Shiyu’s admiration for this miss ye was only between friends.

“After all, everyone liked to appreciate beautiful things. ”

“The assistant pursed his lips. Yes, he must have seen wrongly. ”

“If song Shiyu really liked ye Zhuo, there was no need to be like this. ”

The restaurant seemed to be a little far from here. Ye Zao took out his phone and turned to look at song Shiyu. “Do you play games?”

“Pesticide?”Song Shiyu curled his lips slightly.

“”Yes.”Ye Zao nodded. “Third row, do you want to play?” ”

“Sure.”Song Shiyu took out his phone.

The assistant in the driver’s seat thought he was hearing things.

Playing games.

She did not expect their boss to be so down-to-earth. He even knew about pesticide.

Ye Zhuo logged into the game account. “Let’s add each other as friends first.”

Song Shiyu reported some of the accounts to her.

Ye Zhuo clicked on the search button. “Old Song 001?”

“Yes.”Song Shiyu nodded slightly.

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “You’re not old either. Why did you come up with such a name!” ”

“Song Shiyu’s expression did not change. He said gently, “People have to grow old eventually.” ”

“”That’s true.”Ye zhuo nodded and continued, “I’ll add you. I’m Sitara.” ”

“Mm.”Song Shiyu nodded slightly.

“Ye Zhuo tapped on the invite button and invited Song Shiyu. “Among our three rows, there’s another friend of mine, Zhao Pingting. You’ve met her before.” ”

“There was a time difference between C Nation and China. It was currently 12:30 pm in C Nation, and it was exactly 12 pm in China. ”

“At 12:00 pm, for a young person like Zhao Pingting, the nightlife had just begun. ”

“Okay.”

“After inviting song Shiyu, Zhao Pingting went online. ”

Zhao Pingting turned on the voice chat. “Scorching hot! Can You Hear Me?”

Ye Zhuo turned on the voice chat. “I can hear you.”

“Zhao pingting said, “Who’s Old Song? Is He your friend?” ”

“Yeah.”Ye Zao clicked to start.

“Very soon, he matched up with his teammate and entered the hero selection page. ”

“Zhao pingting said, “I want to play Wang Zhaojun! Remember to help me snatch her!” ”

“Sure.”

“Very soon, the hero selection was done on the first floor. ”

Ye Zao chose a Yuan Ge and brought a wild sword.

The first floor was for archers.

The second floor was for warriors.

“The third floor was for Zhao Pingting’s mage, Wang Zhaojun. ”

The fourth floor was for ye Zao.

Song Shiyu had chosen a support hero.

“Zhao pingting smiled and said, “Great Zao, is that friend of yours Old Song a Noob? We’ll get him to take the order later.” ”

“”He’s pretty good,”ye Zao said. ”

“”It’s good that he’s not a pig teammate,”Zhao pingting continued, “Wang Zhaojun is a crispy-skinned person with too little health. Great Zao, remember to save me later. I feel that the Darji opposite me seems to know how to play.” ”

“Okay.”

“Soon, they entered the game page. ”

Ye Zhuo first took Papa Red and Papa Blue.

“Then, he came to the Middle Lane and helped Zhao Pingting get a health bar. ”

“”Holy Sh * t, Big Scorch. You’re amazing! I love you!”Zhao Pingting was very excited to successfully get a head. ”

“”You develop in the Middle Lane, I’ll go to the opposite side to fight,”ye Zhuo said. ”

“”Well, you go.” ”

“Although there were two people in the opposite field, Zhao Pingting was not worried about ye Zao at all. ”
