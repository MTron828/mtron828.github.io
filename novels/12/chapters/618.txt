“Never regret.”

...

On the other side.

In the garden.

“”Brother, do you have something to say to me?””

Lin Ze looked at Ye Zhuo. “I don’t think you and Cen Shaoqing are suitable.”

A Little White Rabbit and a big bad wolf.

How could they be suitable!

“Because he’s a violent maniac?”Ye Zhuo asked.

Lin Ze frowned slightly and stood up from his chair. He looked like he was going to fight with Cen Shaoqing. “Did that violent maniac attack you?”

“Ye Zao shook his head with a smile. “No. Brother, what are you thinking about?””

“Really?”

“Ye Zao nodded and continued, “Brother, Cen Shaoqing is actually a very good person. I’ve been with him for so long and haven’t noticed any violent tendencies. Are you misunderstanding him?””

“Lin Ze pursed his lips and did not directly answer ye Zao’s question. Instead, he asked, “Zao Zao, did you really like Cen Shaoqing? Or did he threaten you?””

“Ye Zao raised his eyebrows and asked, “Do you think Cen Shaoqing can threaten me?””

“He really didn’t threaten you?”

“He really didn’t.”

“Lin Ze continued, “Zao Zao, Cen Shaoqing is a sly fox. He became famous at the age of eighteen and has the title of evil God in the underworld. How Old Are You? Can you be his opponent?””

How Old was ye Zhonghua?

Nineteen years old!

A nineteen-year-old girl was at the time when she had the most yearning for love and was also the age at which she was most easily deceived.

“When Cen Shaoqing tore her bones into her stomach, she would still be laughing foolishly!”

As an older brother.

Could he just watch his sister be deceived?

“Ye Zhonghua had a smile on his face, “Brother, could it be that in your eyes, your sister is a fool who has been deceived? Although Cen Shaoqing is Sly and cunning, your sister’s cultivation is not shallow either! Don’t worry, I will definitely not be deceived by Cen Shaoqing! You have to believe your sister’s judgment. Cen Shaoqing is really not that kind of person!””

“Lin Ze continued, “Then if he dares to bully you, Tell Me!””

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

Twenty minutes later.

Lin Jincheng and Cen Shaoqing came out of the study room one after another.

“When they came out, Lin Ze and ye Zao were still in the garden.”

Cen Shaoqing’s eyes twitched.

He had a feeling that his future brother-in-law would definitely say a lot of bad things about him in front of ye Zao.

“In a moment, ye Zao and Lin Ze came back from the garden.”

Ye Zao smiled.

Lin Ze had a lot on his mind. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“”Brother, Zhuo Zhuo.”Cen Shaoqing walked in front of the two of them.”

“Lin Ze looked up at CEN Shaoqing. “You’re not allowed to bully my sister! Otherwise, I won’t let you off!””

“Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Brother, don’t worry. I’ll never bully Zhuo Zhuo!””

“Around ten o’clock at night, Cen Shaoqing bid farewell to the Lin family and ye Zhuo sent him to the car.”

Old Lady Lin was very satisfied with CEN Shaoqing. She smiled and told Cen Shaoqing to come over next time.

“Because of Cen Shaoqing, Old Lady Lin found ye Zhuo more pleasing to the eye.”

She originally thought that ye Zhuo was a disappointing person.

She did not expect that ye Zhuo would actually surprise her.

“Looking at Cen Shaoqing and Ye Zhuo’s backs, the jealousy in Feng Xianxian’s eyes was about to spill out. What made her even more disappointed was old lady Lin’s attitude.”

Old Lady Lin had clearly been trying to set her up with Cen Shaoqing.

“In the blink of an eye, Old Lady Lin had forgotten about this matter.”

“After all the guests had left, Old Lady Lin saw that Feng Xianxian’s expression did not look right. “Xianxian, are you feeling unwell?””

“No.”Feng Xianxian shook her head.

“Old Lady Lin grabbed Feng Xianxian’s hand. “Look at how cold your little hand is. Xianxian, if you’re feeling unwell, you must tell Grandma immediately.””

“Feng Qianhua smiled and said, “Aunt Lin, don’t worry about her! This girl has a lot on her mind right now! Who knows what she’s thinking? It’s getting late, Qianxian and I should go back. We’ll come back to see you tomorrow.””

“Okay.”Old Lady Lin nodded and instructed Feng Qianhua to drive carefully.

“After Feng Qianhua and her daughter left, Old Lady Lin was also ready to wash up and rest.”

“Aunt Zhang helped old Mrs. Lin put in the bath water and said hesitantly, “Old Mrs. Lin, there’s something I don’t know if I should say...””

“I’m happy today. Feel free to say whatever you want!”

“Aunt Zhang said hesitantly, “If I say it, please don’t be unhappy.””

“Old Mrs. Lin nodded. “Don’t worry, I won’t be angry.””

“Aunt Zhang then said, “Old Lady, do you know why Xianxian’s expression was so ugly back then?””

“Why?”Old Lady Lin turned to look at Aunt Zhang.

Aunt Zhang Thought for a moment. “Maybe... she was disappointed in you.”
