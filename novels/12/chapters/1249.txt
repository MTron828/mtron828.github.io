“Mike said, “Okay.” ”

Father Zhao’s voice was a little shaky. “Can you hurry up?”

“”Yes,”Mike replied. ”

“Even after hanging up the phone, Father Zhao’s hands were still shaking. ”

He did not dare to imagine what would happen if ye Sen was a Ye...

No.

Definitely not.

Ye Sen was definitely not a Ye.

Father Zhao looked at the night sky and took a deep breath.

At the hospital.

Ye Sen was pushed into the emergency room.

The police officer stood outside the emergency room and contacted Ye Sen’s family.

“”Hello, Hello.” ”

“”Hello, May I know who you are?”A gentle female voice came from the other side. ”

“The police officer continued, “I’m from the Lin Yuan Road Public Security Bureau. Are You Ye Sen’s sister, Ye Shu?” ”

“Hearing that the other party was from the Public Security Bureau, ye Shu asked nervously, “Did something happen to Ye Sen?” ”

“”Yes, Ye Sen was attacked by criminals on Huaihai Road. He’s currently in the Emergency Room...” ”

“Before the policeman could finish his sentence, Ye Shu’s phone fell to the ground. ”

“”Hello, are you listening?”The policeman looked at his phone. ”

“After a long while, Ye Shu picked up the phone with trembling hands. “Is... Is he okay?” ”

There was a sobbing tone in her voice.

“”Ms. Ye, don’t worry. Ye Sen is still in the emergency room.” ”

“Ye Shu covered her mouth and continued, “Then which hospital is he in now?” ”

“”The first People’s Hospital of the city,”the policeman answered. ”

“”Okay, I’ll be there right away. I’ll be there right away!” ”

“After hanging up the phone, Ye Shu was in a mess. ”

“Lin Jincheng came down from upstairs and saw ye Shu like this. He quickly asked, “What happened to Ah Shu?” ”

“Ye Shu grabbed Lin Jincheng’s hand and said with red eyes, “Ye Sen, something happened to Ye Sen!” ”

“”Don’t worry, tell me slowly,”Lin Jincheng continued, “What happened to Ye Sen?” ”

“Ye Shu said, “A policeman just called and said that Ye Sen was attacked by criminals. He is now in the emergency room.” ”

“What! ?” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Hearing this, Lin Jincheng was also shocked. ”

“Soon, he reacted and said, “Which phone number was it? Could it be a liar?” ”

“Ye Shu took out her phone. “This, this number.” ”

Lin Jincheng took the phone and studied it carefully.

It was not a liar’s number.

“Lin Jincheng picked up his coat from the sofa. “Let’s go, Ah Shu. Let’s hurry to the hospital!” ”

Ye Shu nodded.

The couple rushed to the hospital.

“When they arrived at the hospital, there was a group of policemen standing outside the emergency room. ”

“”Officer, how is my brother?”Lin Jincheng asked. ”

“Are You Ye Sen’s Family?”

Lin Jincheng nodded. “I’m his brother-in-law. This is his sister.”

“The tall policeman continued, “Ye Sen is still in the emergency room. He hasn’t come out yet. Don’t worry. The Doctor will definitely save him.” ”

Ye Shu looked at the emergency room and cried.

“Lin Jincheng continued, “Officer, can you please tell me what happened? My Brother is fine. How could he be attacked by criminals?” ”

“”The specific reason is still being investigated. Don’t worry, we will definitely give an explanation to the victims and their families.” ”

Ye Sen nodded.

“Time passed by minute by minute, but there was still no movement in the emergency room. ”

Lin Jincheng and the others arrived at the hospital at 9:30 am. It was already past 1 am.

“Lin Jincheng bought a bottle of mineral water. “Ah Shu, drink some water.” ”

Ye Shu shook her head. “I’m not thirsty.”

“Lin Jincheng patted ye Shu’s shoulder. “Don’t worry, Ye Sen is very lucky. He will definitely be fine.” ”

He’ll be fine?

Will he be fine?

Lin Jincheng did not know either.

“After all, the surgery had already lasted for more than four hours. ”

“At this moment, the emergency room door opened. ”

“Ye Shu immediately went up to greet him. “Doctor, how is my brother? Is He Alright?” ”

“The chief surgeon who was walking in front took off his mask. His expression was not too good, “The patient’s condition is not too good. He may deteriorate at any time. He has already been transferred to the ICU. Your family members should be mentally prepared.” ”

“The ICU was an intensive care unit. If the injury wasn’t too serious, they wouldn’t have been transferred to the ICU! ”

“Moreover, the doctor also told the family members to be mentally prepared. ”

“Unless, Ye Sen really couldn’t make it! ”

“”Wh-what?”Ye Shu’s face turned pale. All the strength in her body seemed to be sucked away in an instant. Fortunately, Lin Jincheng was behind her and immediately held her up. ”

Only then did ye Shu not fall to the ground directly.

...

On the other side.

“Father Zhao received a call from Mike. “Mr. Zhao, I’ve already sent the things you wanted to your email.” ”
