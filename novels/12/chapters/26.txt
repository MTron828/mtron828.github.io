Chapter 27: Wait And See

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Ye Sen was panic-stricken.

He was already a grown man, so it would not be a big deal for him to get beaten up. He would be able to recover in three days at most.

However, it was different for Ye Zhuo. Ye Zhuo’s skin was delicate; her arms were tiny, and her legs were skinny. If she were beaten into a cripple or became disfigured, her life would be over.

Yet, his niece was a fool. She was still feigning her bravery despite the severity of the situation.

It was over! It was over!

She was doomed.

“Screech....”

Meanwhile, the silence of the night was suddenly broken by the sound of a car braking abruptly.

The person who was driving the car was Li Qiandong.

Fortunately, he noticed the situation over here from afar.

So many adult men were actually bullying a young girl... What a really shameless bunch of people!

Witnessing this kind of situation, he had to help her out, of course. “Brother Fifth, you should wait in the car for a while. I’m getting out to check on the situation.”

According to the trick used in romance novels, when a weak, beautiful girl was robbed, the greatest hero in the world would descend from the sky to save the girl, and the beautiful girl would be beyond grateful such that she would pledge to marry the hero.

The more Li Qiandong thought about it, the more excited he became. Hence, he rolled up his sleeves in preparation to get out of the car and beat up the people!

Cen Shaoqing, who was seated at the backseat, had already placed the prayer book on his lap and looked toward the outside with a gentle frown.

From his visual field, he could only see the side silhouette of a person. She had a slim waist and a pair of long, straight, slender legs. In fact,?her waist was so slim that… it seemed like it would break with just a snap.

Even though he could not see her face, he felt that the person seemed familiar for some odd reason.

Then, Cen Shaoqing moved the prayer beads again without any change in his expression.

Li Qiandong opened the door and got out of the car.

At the same time.

The word ‘1’ came out softly from the delicate red lips of the person who was speaking.

Ye Zhuo placed her left hand over her right hand and cracked her knuckles loudly.

It may have sounded slow in description, but it was certainly swift in action. No one could see how she made her move.

“Pow!”

“Thud…”

Li Qiandong stepped out of the car. He was dumbstruck upon witnessing the scene before his eyes. He swallowed a gulp of saliva anxiously.

He could see that the weak, fragile girl had one hand squeezing the tattooed young man’s neck while her other hand was slapping the man’s face loudly. It did not take long before the terrifying palm marks emerged on the tattooed young man’s face.

“How dare you offend the madam! I can see that you don’t want to be in the gang anymore, right?”

What the f*ck? The weak, fragile girl… How did the fragile girl lift a man with just one hand?

How did the fragile girl slap a man to the point where his face went swollen?

Li Qiandong actually took a moment to feel his own face just from observing the scene. He suddenly felt a little pitiful for the tattooed young man.

Ye Sen was dumbfounded as well. His eyes widened in surprise as he looked at Ye Zhuo.

What... what the f*ck!?

His eyes were not playing a trick on him, right?

Was this really his niece?

Meanwhile, the other gangster who was lying on the ground secretly cast a glance at his companion.

The companion nodded and clenched the dagger in his hand tightly. He suddenly got up from the ground and stabbed the dagger toward Ye Zhuo’s chest.

The tip of the dagger emitted a cold radiance under the street lights’ reflection.

It happened in just an instant…

Li Qiandong did not even manage to call out – ‘watch out’.

“Pow!”

The person had already been kicked to the floor again by Ye Zhuo.

Li Qiandong was dumbstruck again and left in shock.

F*ck! That was amazing!

It was then that Ye Sen reacted to the situation. He turned around and sat on the gangster’s body and punched the gangster over and over again. “How dare you do a sneak attack!? How dare you behave rampantly!? How dare you offend my niece!? I’m going to beat you to death today!”

The gangster was stunned from being beaten up, so he apologized repeatedly. “I’m sorry, sir, madam. We... we won’t do it again….”

The other gangsters from the side had also joined in to apologize in haste.

At that point, Ye Zhuo loosened her grip leisurely.

The tattooed young man that had been lifted by her dropped to the ground with a thud. He hastily begged for forgiveness. “Madam, it’s our fault for not recognizing you. We beg you for your generosity; please forgive us….”

“Leave.”

The tattooed young man felt as if he was relieved from a heavy burden. He then led the other gangster to flee in fear.

“Stop.” Ye Zhuo seemed to have remembered something, so she spoke.

The gangsters who were fleeing in fear stopped at once. Their expressions were filled with terror.

In fact, one of them had even peed himself.

“Ma... madam, is there anything else?” The tattooed young man turned around and spoke shakily.

Ye Zhuo raised her hands to tidy up her hair and enunciated her words clearly, “Go back and inform the person who sent you here that I will let her know the reason why flowers are so red.”

The tattooed young man hastily nodded. “Sure, madam. So... can... can we leave now?”

Ye Zhuo then waved her hand to dismiss them.

The tattooed young man immediately ran away without looking back. He ran as if he had motorized legs because he was afraid that Ye Zhuo would change her mind in the next second.

All thanks to Ye Zhuo, these people became marathon-running candidates after they reformed themselves. Of course, this was much later on.

“Let’s go home, uncle.” Ye Zhuo turned around to look toward Ye Sen with an expression that was calm beyond comparison.

She made it look as though the person who exuded tyranny and evilness earlier was not her.

Meanwhile, Ye Sen looked at Ye Zhuo in bewilderment and said subconsciously, “Sure, madam….”

At this point, he seemed to have realized something, so he hastily caught up to Ye Zhuo and corrected himself, “Sure, my niece.”

At that point, Li Qiandong was able to catch a glimpse of the person’s face clearly.

Was it Ye Zhuo?

Li Qiandong drew a cold breath.

Meanwhile, Ye Zhuo furrowed her brows in displeasure and rolled down her sleeves slowly. Her glance swept over him as she said, “What are you looking at!? Haven’t you seen a woman before!?”

Her gaze was ice-cold, akin to the freezing ice in the dead of winter. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

All of a sudden, Li Qiandong’s legs buckled subconsciously. He had only recovered from the surprise when Ye Zhuo and Ye Sen’s silhouettes vanished into the dim alley.

Was that person earlier really Ye Zhuo?

Li Qiandong stretched out his hand to slap his face.

It hurt.

It seemed as though he was not dreaming.

If that person earlier was Ye Zhuo... was she… putting on an act?

Li Qiandong walked to the driver’s seat absentmindedly and turned his head to look toward Cen Shaoqing. “Brother, Brother Fifth, that person earlier seems to be Ye Zhuo.”

“I saw it.” Cen Shaoqing rifled through one page of the prayer book in his hand.

“Do you think she’s putting on an act?” Li Qiandong asked.

Cen Shaoqing flipped through another page of the prayer book but did not speak.

Nevertheless, Li Qiandong continued, “Brother Fifth, I think that she is putting on an act. At first, I was still a little uncertain, but I can confirm it now. Ye Zhuo will certainly turn up at the gambling house tomorrow night. If I lose, I won’t just eat 2kg of pork intestines… it won’t be an issue for me to eat 5kg instead!”

“I shall wait and see.” The corners of Cen Shaoqing’s lips curled up ever so slightly.

…

Ye Sen was still in a trance when they reached home.

He went to pick Ye Zhuo up every night to protect her. He certainly did not expect that he would end up being protected by Ye Zhuo instead today.

The feeling was truly… quite intriguing.

In contrast, Ye Zhuo did not feel anything unusual about what happened. After they arrived home, she went straight to bed after taking a shower.

…

The next day, Li Qiandong arrived at the gambling house early and stood at the guardrail on the second floor. He monitored the situation downstairs without even blinking his eyes in fear that he would miss something.

However, he still did not see Ye Zhuo’s silhouette until past three o’clock in the morning.

Time passed minute by minute. Then, a staff member made his way to the front of Li Qiandong and said respectfully, “Mr. Li, Fifth Master sent me to request your presence in the room.”

“Noted.” Li Qiadong turned around, pushed open the door of the reserved room, and entered.

Cen Shaoqing was seated on the sofa. He did not seem quite like his usual self. His long legs were crossed, and he had a cigarette between his fingers and a string of prayer beads in his left hand.

He looked both like God and the Devil, with coldness permeating from his abstinent aura. His aura alone kept people at a distance.

The tassel of the prayer beads was wrapped around Cen Shaoqing’s fingers as he spoke, “I thought about it for a moment and figured that we should just forget about the live streaming thing.”

Upon hearing that, Li Qiandong felt like he had just been pardoned. He smiled and said, “Thank you, Brother Fifth...”

Li Qiandong did not even manage to finish his sentence before the deep, attractive voice was heard once again, saying, “I’ve already ordered someone to prepare 5kg of pork intestines; you can have it here.”
