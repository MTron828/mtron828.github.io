“Chapter 530: 134: continuous face slapping, a large-scale and fragrant scene! 7”

The surrounding people were even more certain that ye Shu did not know English.

The mocking expressions of the crowd became even more obvious.

“Zhao shuning chuckled, then, he said in English, “I’m sorry, fifth sister-in-law. We have lived abroad for a long time and are used to communicating with others in English. When we return home, we also communicate in English. Everyone in our family knows English. Don’t you know it?” ”

“Ye Shu raised her head to look at Zhao Shuning and said with a smile, “It has been a long time since I last spoke English. Fourth sister-in-law, we will be a family in the future. Please take care of us.” ”

With that said.

The surroundings became even quieter.

That was because ye Shu also spoke fluent English.

“Most importantly, not only did ye Shu speak English, but her pronunciation was also very standard. She was no less than Zhao shuning who had stayed abroad all year round. ”

“In fact, this was all thanks to the foreign teacher ye Zhuo found for ye Shu. ”

“One-on-one tutoring by the foreign teacher, coupled with Ye Shu’s willingness to learn, was enough for ye Shu to speak perfect English in more than a year’s time. ”

“At this moment, Ye Shu was also incomparably glad of her decision at that time. ”

If she didn’t know English today...

She would probably lose face.

“After all, in the Lin family, even Old Lady Lin knew English. ”

Zhao shuning was stunned.

She didn’t expect ye Shu to speak English.

Didn’t they say that ye Shu didn’t even finish middle school?

Feng Qianhua’s face was also slightly pale.

“If she hadn’t seen it with her own eyes, she would almost think that she had mistaken him for someone else! ”

But this was ye Shu!

She hadn’t mistaken him for someone else!

How did ye Shu know English?

What the hell was going on?

“She had originally wanted to embarrass ye Shu, but not only did ye Shu not make a fool of herself, her mellow London accent instead drew gasps from the crowd! ”

“Ye Shu turned her head to look at Ye Zao and switched to Mandarin. “Zao Zao, quickly greet your fourth uncle and fourth aunt.” ”

“Ye Zao raised his eyes slightly and said very politely, “Fourth uncle and fourth aunt, Hello, I’m Ye Zao.” ”

“After saying that, both Zhao shuning and Lin Qingxuan were a little confused. ”

Which language was she speaking?

“Not only Zhao shuning and Lin Qingxuan, even the others were a little confused. ”

“After a while, someone finally reacted. ” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Miss Lin seems to be speaking Arabic.”

“Yes! It’s Arabic. Why does it sound so familiar!”

“Miss Lin is so amazing!”

“Ye Zao seemed to have suddenly remembered something. He freely switched between Chinese and English, “I’m sorry, fourth uncle and fourth aunt. I’ve been studying Arabic recently. When I communicate with others, I habitually communicate in Arabic. I thought that since fourth uncle and fourth aunt have lived abroad all year round, they would definitely understand. I didn’t expect that fourth uncle and fourth aunt didn’t know Arabic...”. “...”. “...” ”

“Ye Zao’s tone was light and casual, but it made Lin Qingxuan and Zhao Shuning’s faces turn green and white. ”

Especially Zhao shuning. She never thought that she would be in the hands of a little girl.

“She wanted to make a fool of the mother and daughter, but she didn’t expect that she would throw a stone at her own feet! ”

Didn’t they say that Ye Zao was an idiot?

An idiot could speak Arabic?

And he spoke it so fluently?

“If it wasn’t for the wrong occasion, Old Mrs. Cen almost wanted to give ye Zao a round of applause. ”

Wonderful!

It was too wonderful!

How could her granddaughter-in-law be so amazing?

All of them wanted to bully her granddaughter-in-law. Did they really think that her granddaughter-in-law was so easy to bully?

Old Mrs. Cen narrowed her eyes and gave ye Zao a thumbs up.

Ye Zao secretly responded to her.

“Cen Shaoqing observed the little movements of the old and the young, and the corners of his mouth curled up slightly. ”

Feng Xianxian was sitting next to ye Zao.

“Looking at the curve on Cen Shaoqing’s face, Feng Xianxian was extremely excited. ”

She smiled!

She smiled!

The unsmiling CEN fifth master actually smiled at her.

“Zhao shuning quickly reacted and said with a smile, “Eldest niece is really ling Yuxiu. She knows people well. Your fourth uncle and I are both old. How can we compare to you youngsters?” ”

“This time, Zhao shuning finally spoke in her mother tongue. ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Fourth aunt is too modest.” ”

Old Madam Lin was almost angered to death by Ye Zhuo.

This wild girl was really too unruly!

Didn’t she know that Zhao Shuning was an elder?

She actually dared to embarrass Zhao shuning!

Was there any respect for seniority in her eyes?

“Old Madam Lin opened her mouth and said, “Shuning, Qingxuan, you guys must have not eaten when you just got off the plane, right? Quickly sit down and eat!” ”

“Zhao shuning walked down the stairs. “Mom, if you hadn’t said it, I wouldn’t have felt hungry! Now that you’ve said it, I feel hungry!” ”

Feng Qianhua had thought that she could take advantage of these two opportunities to directly take down ye Shu and Ye Zhuo tonight.

She didn’t expect that.

The mother and daughter would be able to easily resolve it.

Ye Zhuo knew the piano.

Ye Shu knew English.

How many other aspects of the mother and daughter didn’t deserve?

They thought it would be easy to drive them out of the Lin family.

It seemed that...

They still had to take things slowly.

Feng Qianhua narrowed her eyes.

“After Zhao Shuning and Lin Qingxuan sat down, they realized that the Cen family’s old lady and Cen Shaoqing were sitting at the head of the table. ”

The couple quickly raised their cups and toasted to the old lady and Cen Shaoqing.

Their attitude was very respectful.

“Especially Zhao shinning, his fawning manner was completely different from before. ”

“Although they lived abroad all year round, they could always hear the CEN fifth master’s name. ”

“From this, it could be seen. ”

The Cen family’s influence had already developed from home to abroad.

“Because Old Mrs. Lin and the Cen family had some friendship, the couple could always receive preferential treatment because of the CEN family when they were abroad. ”

“At this moment, Lin Ze came with Ye Sen. ”

Lin Jincheng and ye Shu immediately went over to introduce ye Sen to the guests at the chairman’s table.

Lin Ze sat to the right of Ye Zao.

“Sitting so close to Ye Zao, Lin Ze was a little nervous. The rules of good older brothers on the Internet kept appearing in his mind. ”

What kind of older brother did his sister hate?

What kind of older brother did his sister like?

“From the looks of it, ye Zao should not hate him, right? ”

“Compared to Lin Ze’s nervousness, ye Zao was extremely calm. He stood up and walked out to get some fresh air. However, when he left his seat, the edge of his ear fell to the ground. ”

“Ye Zao patted Lin Ze’s shoulder. “Brother, my stuff fell to your side. Help me pick it up.” ”

“Feng Qianqian just looked at ye Zao, her eyes flashing with excitement. ”

Ye Zao was going to be unlucky.

He dared to let Lin ze pick up things for her.

And he even dared to Pat Lin Ze’s shoulder.

“With Lin Ze’s personality, he would definitely throw a tantrum for ye Zao to see. ”

Did Ye Zao really think of herself as Lin Ze’s sister?

She didn’t even think about how much she weighed!
