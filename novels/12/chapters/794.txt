It was as if she did not look at her.

Old Lady Lin frowned.

What was going on?

Could it be that Lin Jincheng and ye Shu did not see her? Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Feng Qianxian was also stunned.

She had never expected that Lin Jincheng and ye Shu would have such a reaction.

“Lin Jincheng!”

Old Lady Lin said angrily.

“What’s the matter?”Lin Jincheng turned to look at Old Lady Lin.

“Old Lady Lin continued, “Unfilial son! You Don’t even call me mother anymore? Do you still want me to forgive you?” ”

Lin Jincheng did not say anything.

“”If you still want me to forgive you, divorce ye Shu immediately! Let Her take ye Zhuo’s pack and leave! Otherwise, I will never forgive you! Don’t even think about taking me home!” ”

“Lin Jincheng looked at Old Lady Lin with a normal expression, “The issue now is not whether you forgive me or not, but whether I am willing to forgive you! If you like living outside, then just stay here. No one will stop you.” ”

Lin Jincheng was extremely disappointed in Old Lady Lin.

“If he had a choice, he would rather not have such a mother. ”

“After saying that, Lin Jincheng turned his head to look at Ye Shu. “Ah Shu, let’s go.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Shu nodded.

Old Lady Lin thought that she was hallucinating.

Lin Jincheng did not beg her.

“Not only did he not beg her, he did not even say anything soft. ”

Could it be that Lin Jincheng was not here to bring her home?

What was going on?

Could it be that Lin Jincheng was not afraid that the LIN Corporation would go bankrupt?

“As she watched Lin Jincheng and ye Shu’s figures get further and further away, Old Lady Lin’s heart started to panic. ”

Feng Qianqian was also unable to react in time.

Could it be that Lin Jincheng didn’t even want the Lin Group anymore?

Or could it be that.

The Lin Group already had a turn for the better?

No!

That was impossible!

“As long as Cen Shaoqing didn’t make a move, the LIN Group would have no hope of making a comeback. ”

“Feng Xianxian held onto Old Lady Lin’s arm. “Grandma, Let’s go home first.” ”

“Okay.”Old Lady Lin nodded.

Old Lady Lin did not know how she went upstairs with Feng Xianxian.

She did not understand why Lin Jincheng had suddenly become like this.

Could it be that Lin Jincheng did not want the Lin Corporation anymore?

Did he not want her as his mother?

Elder Lin sat on the sofa in a daze the same day.

Feng Xianxian opened the stock market.

When she saw it.

She was immediately stunned.

“The stock of the LIN Corporation, which had already fallen by the daily limit, actually rose back up at this moment. ”

What was going on?

Could it be that Cen Shaoqing had helped?

How could this be?

No!

It couldn’t be like this.

“At this moment, Feng Xianxian almost couldn’t believe her eyes. ”

“After a long while, Feng Xianxian finally reacted. She walked over to Old Lady Lin and handed her phone to her. “Grandma, take a look at this.” ”

“Seeing this scene, Old Lady Lin’s face turned pale. ”

She finally understood why Lin Jincheng dared to speak to her like that.

So the Lin Corporation had already resolved the crisis.

But.

How could this be?

How could Lin Jincheng turn things around if a few shareholders withdrew their capital collectively?

Could it be that those people had gone back on their word?

Old Mrs. Lin hurriedly called Zhou Dawei.

“Zhou Dawei was currently having a beautiful dream of acquiring the LIN Group and was planning to look for Lin Jincheng the next day. When he saw Old Mrs. Lin’s call, he thought that it was old Mrs. Lin who had called to plead for mercy, without thinking, he hung up the phone. ”

“Old Mrs. Lin kept calling. In the end, Zhou Dawei blocked old Mrs. Lin’s call. ”

“Damn old woman, does she really think she is someone important? ”

The next morning.

Zhou Dawei had just woken up when there was a commotion downstairs. Zhou Dawei hurried downstairs.

He saw that Wang Jianguo and the other three shareholders had come.

Today was the day they discussed buying the LIN Group.

But Zhou Dawei didn’t expect the four of them to come so early.

“Zhou Dawei smiled and walked downstairs. “Brother Li, brother Liu, brother Wang, Brother Sun, why are you here so early?” ”

“When he saw Zhou Dawei, Wang Jianguo quickly went up to him. “Brother Zhou! Something Big has happened!” ”

“”What is it?”Zhou Dawei was in a very good mood today. After all, he was about to buy the LIN Group. “Could it be that the Sky has fallen?” ”

“It’s more serious than this!”

“Zhou Dawei was not in the mood to listen to Wang Jianguo talk about other things. He continued, “Since you’re all here, let’s Go Now! We’ll go to Lin Jin city to discuss the acquisition!” ”

Wang Jianguo was on the verge of tears. “Brother Zhou! Haven’t you seen today’s financial news?”
