“”Yes, yes, yes, she should be called True Lotus!” ”

“I’ve never seen such a person in my entire life. She did not do well in her exams and even blamed the Chief Examiner!”

“”Fortunately, we all trusted her so much!” ”

“”It’s all Liu Jingjing’s fault. If it weren’t for Liu Jingjing Fanning the flames, we wouldn’t have misunderstood the examiner.” ”

“Seeing that everyone was pointing their spears at him, Liu Jingjing hurriedly explained, “It’s not like that! I was also misled by Wanyin! If you want to blame someone, blame Zheng Wanyin. This matter has nothing to do with me!” ”

“After saying that, Liu Jingjing turned to look at Zheng Wanyin. “Wanyin, to think that I trusted you so much! And I even brought people to support you! You’ve really disappointed me!” ”

“At such a critical moment, of course, she had to protect herself! ”

“Moreover, this matter was Zheng Wanyin’s problem to begin with. ”

“If it wasn’t for Zheng Wanyin, she wouldn’t have brought so many people here and caused such a situation. ”

“Hearing Liu Jing’s accusations and the comments of the crowd, Zheng Wanyin’s face was deathly pale, and she almost couldn’t stand still. ”

How could it be.

How did things turn out like this?

Where did the CEO get the surveillance cameras?

Didn’t they say that China had not implemented the surveillance assessment yet?

Also...

“Before the assessment, she had clearly made all the preparations. ”

How could she have ended up like this!

No.

This was not her test.

No.

Zheng Wan ‘Yin took a few steps back.

“The CEO’s voice sounded in the air again, “Zheng Wan ‘Yin, do you have anything else to say?” ”

Zheng Wanyin did not say anything.

“She stood rooted to the ground, almost fainting. ”

She did not expect things to turn out this way.

“Things had already come to this point, what else could she say? ”

Who would believe that the surveillance cameras were fake?

No one would believe her at all.

“After saying that, the CEO looked at Zheng Wanyin again. “Since there isn’t any, then I announce that Zheng Wanyin’s results for this assessment will be canceled. She will be removed from the core team and will not be able to join the ABA for the rest of her life!” ” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The results will be canceled.

She will be removed from the core group.

“Zheng Wanyin clenched her fingers tightly. Because she had used too much strength, her fingers had already turned slightly white. ”

She had never thought that such a day would come.

It was as if she was dreaming.

“Moreover, it was a nightmare that she could not wake up from. ”

What should she do...

What should she do now?

“Retribution!”Old Mrs. Cen looked at Zheng Wanyin and spat softly.

“Zhou Xiang looked at Xie wanqiu’s darkened face and tugged at Old Mrs. Cen’s sleeve. “Mom, Lower Your Voice.” ”

Xie Wanqiu was in a rage. Wasn’t old Mrs. Cen adding fuel to the fire?

“Xie wanqiu was a person who cared about her face. Fortunately, there were no outsiders other than them. If there were outsiders, Xie wanqiu would probably faint from anger. ”

“”I know, I know.”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “But I’m not afraid of Xie Wanqiu. Xiang Xiang, I’m giving you face! For your sake, I’ll lower my voice!” ”

“Zhou xiang smiled and said, “Thank you for giving me face.” ”

“”You’re welcome, you’re welcome.”Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “Who asked us to be a family!” ”

“The CEO turned to look at the crowd again. “And you guys, who among you still has doubts about the test scores? Step forward now and take the opportunity to investigate together!” ”

“Hearing this, the crowd immediately stepped back. ”

“”No, no, CEO, we believe in You, and we believe in ABA even more!” ”

“”Yes, yes, yes! We all believe in ABA!” ”

“The CEO walked to Ye Zao’s side. “Miss Ye, I’m sorry for making a fool of myself.” ”

“It’s fine.”Ye Zao stood up from his chair.

The CEO followed behind ye Zao.

“A moment later, ye Zao looked back slightly and said in a calm tone, “Where’s the secret formula?” ”

Secret Formula?

What secret formula?

The CEO was stunned for a moment.

“Ye Zao continued, “Mei Xin Fang Tang Mu Xue’s secret formula.” ”

“The CEO quickly reacted. This big shot loved sweets like his life. If it wasn’t for Mei Xin Fang Tang Mu Xue’s rice, he really wouldn’t have been able to invite this big shot, “So that’s what Miss Ye was talking about! Don’t worry, I, Zhou, have always been the same. Since I’ve promised you, I Won’t go back on my words. Please follow me, Miss Ye.” ”

“With that, the CEO took a step forward. ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and followed the CEO’s footsteps.

Zheng Wanyin stood where she was and looked at the back of Ye Zhuo and the CEO. Her expression was unclear.

Old Mrs. Cen’s gaze swept past Zheng Wanyin and turned back to look at Cen Shaoqing. “We’ve finished watching the show. Let’s go look for Ye Zi.”

Show?

Whose show was this damn old woman Bai Tang going to watch?

“If it wasn’t for Ye Zhuo, Zheng Wanyin would have become a joke. ”
