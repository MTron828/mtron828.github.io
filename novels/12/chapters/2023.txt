“The warm water entered his throat, and he felt his entire body warm up. ” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“After drinking the water, Ye Zao continued to look for the purple leaf flower. ”

“In the blink of an eye, another two hours passed. ”

“Just as ye Zao thought that he would return disappointed this time, she suddenly saw a bright purple in the white snow. ”

Purple leaf flower!

Ye Zao narrowed his eyes and immediately walked over.

“As described in the book, purple leaf flower grew on the dangerous cliff. ”

It was not an easy task to successfully pick the purple leaf flower.

The cold here was not suitable for flying aircraft.

She could only take the risk.

“Ye Zao took out a black rubber band from her pocket and tied her black hair into a bun, revealing her snow-white neck. ”

“Then, she walked to the edge of the cliff. ”

She climbed slowly.

“Fortunately, ye Zao’s arm strength was not bad, and soon, she climbed to the edge of the purple leaf flower. ”

Ye Zao’s lips curved slightly. There was a beautiful curve at the corner of his mouth as he reached out to pick the purple leaf flower.

Boom!

“At this moment, a snow-white giant beast suddenly jumped out from the edge of the purple leaf flower and bit ye Zao’s wrist. ”

Fresh blood dripped from the snow monster’s mouth.

Cold Sweat broke out on Ye Zao’s head almost instantly.

The pain was unbearable and his face was pale.

The legend of the ancient glacier snow monster suddenly sounded.

“It turned out that the snow monster was not a legend, but like the purple-leafed flower, it was real. ”

The reason why she did not meet the snow monster along the way was that the snow monster was born to protect the purple-leafed flower.

What should she do now?

The Snow Monsters’goal was obviously to make her release the purple leaf flower.

No.

No.

The purple leaf flower was ye Han’s only hope.

“No matter what, she would not let go. ”

“Ye Zao held the purple leaf flower tightly, and the snow monsters also tightened their grip, as if they could bite off that slender wrist at any time. ”

“Ye Zao endured the pain and finally took out a dagger from his waist, stabbing it into the Snow Monsters’head. ”

“Roar!”

The Snow Monster let out an angry roar and opened its mouth to let go of Ye Zao.

Ye Zao’s entire body fell straight down.

“There was a bottomless abyss below. If he fell, he would definitely die. ”

“Ye Zao held the purple leaf flower in his hand tightly. Suddenly, he seemed to have thought of something and reached for the button on his waist. ”

“Bang!”

A white umbrella opened above her head.

“Fortunately, she was prepared and equipped with a parachute at her waist. Otherwise, she would have lost her life here today. ”

“Ye Zao put the purple leaf flower into her backpack, took out the emergency medicine bag, and simply bandaged her wrist. Then, she operated the parachute and flew towards the aircraft. ”

An hour later.

The parachute arrived near the aircraft.

Ye Zao jumped down from the parachute.

She piloted the aircraft and left.

“Just as she set up the route of the aircraft, her vision turned black and she fainted. ”

“”Great Burning! Great Burning! Woo Woo, great burning, are you okay?”While she was unconscious, ye Zao heard Yi Ling’s voice. It seemed that some liquid had landed on her face. ”

“Ye Zao wanted to open her eyes, but her eyelids seemed to be glued together. She could not open them no matter how hard she tried. ”

“Da Zao! Don’t die...”

“After an unknown amount of time, ye Zao slowly opened his eyes. ”

“Seeing that she had finally woken up, Yi Ling was extremely excited. “Da Zao! You’re awake! Are You Okay?” ”

“”... I’m fine.”The moment she opened her mouth, Ye Zao realized that her voice was already hoarse. ”

“Yi Ling continued, “Do you want some water?” ”

Ye Zao shook his head slightly and sat up on the bed with his left hand. “Go get my medical kit.”

“While she was unconscious, Yi Ling had already bandaged her injured right hand. ”

But that was not enough.

“The injury on her right hand was not just a bite. If she guessed correctly, the snow monster’s saliva contained poison. ”

“Okay.”Yi Ling immediately flew over to get the medical kit.

“Very soon, she came over with the medical kit. ”

“Ye Zao opened the medical kit with one hand, took out a syringe, and injected himself with one hand. ”

“”Great Zao Zao, How Do You Feel Now?”Yi Ling asked anxiously. ”

“”Don’t worry, I’m fine.”Ye Zao stretched out his left hand and patted Yi Ling’s head. ”

“Yi Ling’s eyes were red as she said, “You keep saying that you’re fine, and you even lied to me that you wouldn’t go to the Eternal Glacier! You’re a big liar!” ”

“”If I don’t go, What About Ye Han?” ”

“Is there no other way to save Ye Xiaohan?”Yi Ling asked.

Ye Zhuo shook his head slightly. “There’s no other way.”

“Yi ling cried and said, “Then what about you? Why do you always think of others!” ”

“”Don’t Cry, I’m really fine.”Ye Zhuo patted Yi Ling’s small head. “Get Ready, we’ll go look for ye Han in a while.” ”

“Yi Ling first nodded, then said worriedly, “Don’t you need to rest?” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “I said I’m fine.” ”

On the other side.

The Qiu family.

Ye Han came back from the red and Blue Mountain with blood stones.

“”Young miss, this is all of my harvest.” ”

Qiu Di took the Red Stones. “Why is it only so little?”

“The amount of red stones ye Han brought back this time was limited, so he could only pave a narrow path. ”

Shabby.

It was simply too shabby!

“Ye Han bent his back and continued, “The number of grade three armored beasts on the red and Blue Mountains is limited. If all of them are killed, those grade three armored beasts will probably become extinct.” ”

Autumn flute frowned tightly.

“”Young miss, atone for your sins.”Ye Han immediately knelt on one knee. ”

“”Go kneel in the Rain!”Autumn flute said coldly, “Don’t be an eyesore here!” ”

Ye Han stood up and walked outside.

Qiu Di looked at his back and the corners of his mouth curled up.

He really wanted ye Zhuo to see ye Han’s appearance at this moment.

The group leader ye whom everyone admired had become her lapdog!

Strong acid rain was raining outside.

Ye Han did not hesitate and directly knelt in the rain.

“Through the rain, Qiu Chang Zhen frowned slightly and turned to look at Qiu Di. “Di’er, actually, you don’t have to treat ye Han like this. Aren’t you afraid that he will suddenly recover his memory under the stimulation of the strong acid rain?” ”

“Qiu Di’s eyes were filled with sarcasm. “Don’t worry, father. Ye Han won’t be able to live for long.” ”

“Once she ascended to the position of female sovereign, Ye Han would lose his value. ”

This was what ye Zhuo saw when he appeared at the Qiu Residence with Yi Ling.

Yi Ling came out from the backpack behind ye Zhuo. “I’ve asked around. That bad woman Qiu di often tortures ye Xiao Han like this and often hits and scolds him. She doesn’t even treat ye Xiao Han as a human!”
