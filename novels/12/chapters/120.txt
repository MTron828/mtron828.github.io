Chapter 121: 078: an unknown past! Brother Ze, your birth mother might be in Yunjing! 7

“Mother, I’m relieved to hear that. It’s my fortune to have a granddaughter like you!”

At first, grandfather Yang was worried that ye Shu would disagree.

He didn’t expect ye Shu to be more reasonable than he had imagined.

At noon, Old Master Yang stayed at the Ye residence to eat.

Ye Shu cooked a big table of food.

Old Master Yang hadn’t eaten such a common meal for a long time. He ate two bowls of rice in one go. If it wasn’t the New Year’s Eve tomorrow and they had to rush back to the capital for the new year, he even wanted to stay for dinner at the Ye residence.

The next day was the New Year’s Eve.

This was the first new year after Ye Zhuo returned to Ye Shu’s side.

Although there were only three people at home, the smell of the new year was still very strong.

Early in the morning, Ye Shu got up to prepare the New Year’s Eve dinner.

Ye Sen, on the other hand, went to look for couplets to buy.

When Ye Zhuo ran back, he saw ye Sen squatting in the small garden in front of him, installing small colored lights. Beside him were electric firecrackers and small lanterns...

“Uncle, let me help you.”Ye Zao rolled up his sleeves and walked to Ye Sen’s side.

Ye Sen smiled and said, “You are just a little girl. How would you do such a Job? Go back and wash your hands. It’s time for breakfast.”

“Uncle, do you look down on me?”Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly.

“Why don’t you try it?”Ye Sen handed the colored lights to ye Zao.

Ye Zao took the colorful lights and installed them on the wires one by one. Looking at the exposed copper wires, ye Zao didn’t even frown during the whole process.

“Sure!”Ye Sen was a little surprised.

Ye Zao clapped his hands. “Of course! Why Don’t you see whose niece I am!”

Ye Sen was coaxed until he was beaming with joy.

“Zao Zao! Tell your uncle to come back for dinner!”Ye Shu’s voice came from inside.

“Got it,”ye Zhulong replied. “Uncle, let’s go back for dinner.”

Ye Sen nodded.

They were having a good time here, but the Lin family, which was thousands of miles away, did not have such a good atmosphere.

At the dining table.

Old Lady Lin looked at the father and son who were eating. “I plan to have Qianhua and Xianxian come to our house for a reunion dinner tonight.”

Old Mrs. Lin had five sons.

But the other four sons were not around. They would not bring their wives and children to the old house until the first day of the New Year.

Therefore, there were only three people in the old house every year during the New Year.

Old Mrs. Lin was old, and Lin Jincheng and Lin Ze were dull.

As a result, the entire Lin family did not have any sense of the new year.

On the other hand, Old Lady Lin also wanted to take advantage of this opportunity to let the father and son feel the warmth of the new home.

With Feng Qianhua and Feng Xianxian, the family would also have some warmth.

“This is against the rules.”Lin Jincheng put down his chopsticks. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“What’s against the rules?”Old Lady Lin frowned.

Lin Jincheng frowned. “After all, the mother and daughter are outsiders.”

Old Madam Lin also put down her chopsticks. “If you marry again, won’t your wife be an outsider?”

“So,”Lin Jincheng’s face was expressionless. “I have no intention of marrying again.”

Old Madam Lin’s face darkened. “It’s the New Year! Do you really want me to be angry with you?”

Lin Jincheng did not say anything.

Lin Ze did not say anything either.

The father and son were unusually quiet.

At this time, Old Mrs. Lin couldn’t help but think of Feng Xianxian. If it was Feng Xianxian, she would definitely open her mouth to persuade Lin Jincheng.

Feng Xianxian was a very obedient and sensible girl.

Feng Qianhua taught her very well.

A child with a mother was different from a child without a mother.

It was fine if ye Shu didn’t fulfill her responsibilities as a mother for a day, but Lin ze still had her in his heart.

At this moment, the sound of a phone call rang in the air.

Lin Ze walked to the living room to answer the call.

It was Li Wen.

“Hello, brother Ze.”

“Go ahead.”

Li Wen continued, “We’ve found out about the candy wrappers. They were made in Yun Jing. If the candy wrappers were left behind by your mother, she should be in Yun Jing right now.
