“No matter how heartless song Shiyu was, Chen Siyao always had a glimmer of hope for him. ”

She felt that song Shiyu had a little affection for her.

“First, they had known each other since they were young. ”

“Second, Old Master Chen had saved song Shiyu. ”

“Just based on this last point alone, Song Shiyu definitely wouldn’t ignore her. ”

Song Shiyu probably thought that she was just playing around.

“Then this time, she had to show song Shiyu her determination. She had to let song Shiyu know that she really didn’t want to live anymore. ”

“She believed that as long as she experienced life and death, Song Shiyu would definitely be able to see her. ”

“At this thought, the corners of Chen Siyao’s lips curled up. She said even more firmly, “I’m not going to the hospital!” ”

“The assistant frowned. “Miss, with your current state, if you don’t go to the hospital, something bad will definitely happen.” ”

Chen Siyao hadn’t eaten for nearly four days.

“Under normal circumstances, not eating for a week would affect her life. ”

“You don’t have to worry about that!”Chen Siyao said with a pale face.

Her heart also thirsted for food.

“But as long as she thought about Song Shiyu, she didn’t want anything else. ”

“This was her last chance, and she had to take it. ”

“”Miss,”the assistant sighed and reached out to help Chen Siyao onto the bed. “Why are you doing this? !” ”

“Looking at Chen Siyao from the assistant’s point of view, she couldn’t understand Chen Siyao’s thoughts at all. ”

“Chen Siyao came from an extraordinary background. She was a fair, rich, and beautiful woman who didn’t lack anything. There were so many men in the world, so why should she hang herself on a tree? ! ”

“If she were Chen siyao, she would never use her life to coerce a man. ”

Because it wasn’t worth it.

Chen Siyao closed her eyes and didn’t say anything.

“The assistant continued, “Then I’ll call doctor Liu Over.” ”

Doctor Liu.

“In Nanhai, there was no other doctor Liu other than song Shiyu’s personal doctor whom the assistant called Doctor Liu. ”

Chen Siyao naturally wouldn’t object if her assistant took the initiative to look for Doctor Liu.

“Seeing that Chen Siyao didn’t say anything, the assistant continued, “Then I’ll go look for Doctor Liu. Miss, if you’re hungry, there’ll be food on the coffee table.” ”

“Chen Siyao wasn’t going to say anything else, but after some thought, she said, “Wait a moment.” ”

“The assistant stopped in his tracks. “Miss, do you have any other instructions?” ”

“Do you know what to say and what not to say when you go to Doctor Liu’s place?”Chen Siyao asked.

“The assistant nodded. “Don’t worry, I know everything.” ”

“Chen Siyao had personally chosen the assistant, so she trusted her quite a bit. Hearing this, Chen Siyao continued, “You go ahead.” ”

“”Then I’ll take my leave, miss.” ”

Chen Siyao closed her eyes and didn’t say anything else.

The assistant immediately went to Dr. Liu’s address.

“Because of Song Shiyu, the assistant had followed Chen Siyao to Dr. Liu’s address before. ”

“Dr. Liu was studying rare cases at home. When he saw Chen Siyao’s assistant coming over, he smiled and said, “Why is little Xu here today? Resting?” ”

“Little Xu shook his head. “Dr. Liu, I came over to invite you to visit our young miss.” ”

“Miss Chen?”Doctor Liu asked.

Little Xu nodded. “Yes.”

“Doctor Liu frowned slightly and asked, “What’s wrong with Miss Chen?” ”

“Little Xu didn’t know how to say it either. He sighed and said, “Our eldest miss went on a hunger strike. She hasn’t eaten for four days and four nights.” ”

Hunger strike?

Doctor Liu was a little shocked. “What’s the matter?”

“Usually, Chen Siyao looked like a very cheerful person. ”

He didn’t expect that she would go on a hunger strike.

“Little Xu sighed again, “Originally, I shouldn’t have interfered with my boss’s matters, but this time, there’s really no other way. Miss isn’t willing to go to the hospital. Doctor Liu, quickly go and see Miss! If this continues, I’m afraid that someone will really die!” ”

A doctor’s heart is like a parent’s.

“When he heard about this, Dr. Liu immediately packed his medical kit. “Let’s go, let’s go, we’ll leave right now!” ”

The assistant immediately followed Dr. Liu’s footsteps.

The two of them chatted as they walked.

“Dr. Liu continued to ask, “What exactly is the matter, Miss Chen?” ”

“The assistant didn’t know how to say it either. He continued, “Dr. Liu, you should know that our eldest miss has always liked third master song, right?” ”

“I know.”Dr. Liu nodded.

It was no secret that Chen Siyao liked song Shiyu.

“At this moment, Dr. Liu came to his senses. “Could it be that it was because of boss song that Miss Chen...” ”

The rest was self-evident.
