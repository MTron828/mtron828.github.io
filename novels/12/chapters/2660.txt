Translator: 549690339

“When they heard this cry, everyone who had been standing outside the operating theater suddenly became energetic. ”

“Lin Ze, in particular, immediately ran to the door of the delivery room. ”

“Not long after, the door to the delivery room was opened. A nurse came out with the child in her arms. “Which one of you is Bai Jingshu’s family member?” ”

“”Me,”Lin ze immediately said. ”

Ye Shu ran over as well. “We all are.”

“The nurse smiled and said, “Congratulations to both of you. The mother and child are safe. The child weighs 8.3 kilograms. It’s been very hard on the adults.” ”

The mother and child are safe...

“Lin Ze was stunned for a moment. Then, he raised his head to look at the nurse. “It’s... It’s a small iron pillar?” ”

The nurse was stunned. “What Iron Pillar?”

Ye Shu took the child from the nurse’s hands and smiled. “I knew it was definitely a boy.”

“At this moment, Lin Ze couldn’t care less about other questions. “Where’s my wife?” ”

“The adults still need to observe inside. You guys can wait for a while. Don’t worry.”

“Lin ze nodded and continued, “Then can I go in?” ”

“Not at the moment.”

“Seeing Lin ze like this, Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Brother, do you want to go in and see sister-in-law?” ”

“Yes.”Lin Ze nodded.

“Although he had already seen the child, he was still a little worried that he didn’t see Bai Jingshu. ”

“Ye Zao continued, “Xiao Li, take my brother to change into the isolation suit.” ”

“Xiao Li knew ye Zao, so he nodded and said, “Okay, Mr. Xiao Lin, follow me.” ”

Lin Ze followed Xiao Li and changed into the isolation suit.

“Not long after, Lin Ze changed into his isolation suit and entered the delivery room. ”

Outside.

“Ye Shu held the child in her arms and asked the nurse, “Miss Nurse, what should we pay attention to now? Should we give the child a Bath?” ”

“There’s no need for a bath now. We’ll take a bath in three days.”

“Okay.”Ye Shu nodded.

“Ye Zao stood beside Ye Shu. “Mom, give me a hug.” ”

“”Okay.”Ye Shu handed the child to ye Zao. “Come, let Auntie hug it.” ”

“The child was just born. It was small, soft, and its skin was still red. Ye Zao had never seen a newborn child before. He asked in puzzlement, “Why is he so wrinkled? He looks like a little old man.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing glanced at ye Zao. Actually, he had wanted to say this the moment he saw the child, but he did not dare to. ”

Ye Zao was the best. He dared to say anything.

“Hearing this, Ye Shu smiled and said, “All newborn children are like this. They will recover after a few days. Don’t look at how ugly they are now. This child is different every day.” ”

Ye Zao nodded slightly. “I see.”

“After saying this, Ye Zao looked at the child in his arms and continued, “Tiezhu, Little Tiezhu, I’m your aunt.” ”

“Tie Zhu?”Cen Shaoqing was stunned.

How could a good child be called tie Zhu?

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “This is the nickname my brother gave me.” ”

Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads. “Can your sister-in-law agree to this?”

Lin tie Zhu?

“”My sister-in-law only cares about the big name. The nickname doesn’t matter,”ye Zhuo said. ”

“The big name is Lin Xi?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

She had talked to Cen Shaoqing when she was naming her child.

“”This name is very nice and has a moral. In the future, you will also be the one to name our baby,”Cen Shaoqing continued. ” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Ye Zao shook his head slightly. “I’m almost numb to it. It’s better for you to do it.”Ye Zao had named many children before.

“”That’s fine as long as you believe in my aesthetic judgment,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“”Take a few more and I’ll review them,”ye Zhuo continued. ”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Ye Zhuo looked at the ugly child in his arms and suddenly did not feel ugly anymore. He continued, “Who do you think tie Zhu looks like?” ”

Like Who?

This really stumped Cen Shaoqing because he felt that this child did not look like anyone else.

“”Like...”Cen Shaoqing considered his choice of words in his heart and continued, “A little like your brother, but also a little like your sister-in-law.” ”

This answer should not be a problem.

“Ye Zao said, “Why can’t I see anything that looks like them?”This newborn child did not even open his eyes. Ye Zao could not see anything that looked like Lin Ze or Bai Jingshu. ”

“Let me take a look.”Lin Jincheng walked over from the side. “Let me see Who Little Tiezhu looks like.”

“As he spoke, Lin Jincheng was about to reach out to carry the child. Just as his hand was about to reach the child, Ye Shu, who was beside him, opened it with a bang. ”

“Do you know how to carry a Child?”

“Lin Jincheng immediately retracted his hand and said somewhat aggrievedly, “Why don’t I know how to carry a Child?” ”
