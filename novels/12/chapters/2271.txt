“”The remaining box belongs to your father and me,”Zhou Ying continued, “Don’t even think about it!” ”

“Hearing this, Bai Jingfei was extremely disappointed. ”

“Her parents usually said that their sons and daughters were the same, but when it came to the critical moment, the difference was obvious. ”

“Star Energy’s two younger brothers had it, but she didn’t! ”

“This made Bai Jingfei very unwilling. She continued, “Mom, am I your biological child?” ”

“I picked you up!”Zhou Ying said.

“Bai Jingfei’s brows furrowed tightly. “I think so too. Otherwise, why would I be inferior to Liwen and Liwu everywhere!” ”

Zhou Ying poked Bai Jingfei’s head. “What are you thinking about! All Day Long!”

“I’m thinking about how you’re biased! You’re simply the most biased mother in the world!”Bai Jingfei was very angry. Why did she not have what her two younger brothers had?

She had always been like this since she was young. This was too much!

“Zhou Ying could not be bothered with Bai Jingfei. “Even if I’m biased, I’ve raised you up! Think about how you’re going to repay your father and me in the future!” ”

“Bai Jingfei turned around and left. Because she was too angry, she casually kicked a small robot away. ”

Bang Bang Bang.

The small robot was kicked to the ground and rolled several times.

“On the other side, Bai Jingshu was locked in her room. The windows and doors were sealed. She could neither escape nor contact the outside world. ”

What should she do now?

Was she going to sit and wait for death?

“Bai Jingshu was already beginning to regret it. If she had known this would happen, she would not have come back. ”

“However, it was better this way. Otherwise, she would never be able to recognize the faces of those people. ”

“The next day, the Chen family sent someone over to ask. ”

“Bai Jiasheng said to the person who came, “Butler Wang, please go back and tell Master Chen that it’s not easy for us parents to make decisions about the child’s matters. After all, this matter was caused by your second young master. I’m currently advising my daughter to trouble him to wait for a few more days!” ”

“Butler Wang also looked down on people like Bai Jiasheng, but he did not show it on his face. He still said politely, “Mr. Bai, may I ask how many more days we need to wait? If you can be more clear, it will be easier for me to answer when I go back.” ”

“Bai Jiacheng thought for a moment and then said, “Three days. Three days later, I will definitely give a reply to Patriarch Chen and Madam Chen.” ”

“”Okay.”The butler nodded. “Then, I will go back and tell Patriarch.” ”

Butler Wang went all the way back to the Chen family.

“After listening to Butler Wang’s words, Chen Jinyan’s expression did not look good. ”

What a Bai Jiacheng!

He had actually stepped on his toes repeatedly.

“Madam Chen frowned and said, “Jinyan, must the Bai family take action on this matter? Is there no other way?” ”

She really could not stand the Bai family’s despicable attitude.

They had taken advantage of the situation and were still trying to be obedient!

“Chen Jinyan shook his head. “In this matter, other than the Bai family, there is another force that must be removed by Bai Jingzhu herself.” ” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Madam Chen snorted coldly. “This Bai Jingzhu is really good! Once she knows that we must beg her!”

Just you wait!

“After Chen Yaosheng married Bai Jingshu back, she would definitely teach her a lesson. ”

“”I’ll just wait for three more days!”Chen Jinyan had been quite tired these days because of this matter. He rubbed his temples, “I’ve said it before. Yaosheng is too arrogant. If he doesn’t restrain himself, he’ll get into big trouble sooner or later!” ”

“How can yaosheng be blamed for this? This is obviously Bai Jingshu’s little B * Tch who set Yaosheng Up!”

“As the second son of the Chen family, Chen Yaosheng had all the women he wanted? Why did he have to rape a B * tch? ”

“Being set up is also his problem! Why isn’t anyone else set up?”Chen Yaosheng looked at Mrs. Chen.

“Mrs. Chen didn’t say anything. She was furious. This time, she admitted defeat! ”

But this was not the end!

“What if they still do the same thing three days later?”Madam Chen was a little worried.

“”They won’t,”Chen Jinyan said. “The Bai family is a person who will stop at nothing to gain power. He will definitely not let go of this good opportunity to soar.” ”

“Yes.”Madam Chen nodded.

Bai Jingshu had already been locked up by the Bai family’s parents for a day and a half.

“During this time and a half, she had not eaten anything, not even a drop of water. Her face was already a little pale. ”

“At that moment, there was a knock on the door. ”

“Bai Jingshu leaned against the headboard of the bed, raised her eyelids, and did not say a word. ”

“Then, the voice of a servant came from outside the door. “Eldest miss, Madam asked me to say something to you. Don’t be stubborn. They are all doing this for your own good. If this continues, you will only be at a disadvantage.” ”
