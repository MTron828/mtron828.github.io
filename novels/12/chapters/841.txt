“It will work. It works every time.”

“At this moment, her teammate changed No. 7 Luban to Kai.”

“Afraid that her teammate would regret it, old Mrs. Cen immediately clicked on No. 7 Luban.”

“”Look!”Old Mrs. Cen looked at Ye Zhuo and said proudly, “Okay! Am I Good?””

“Good! You Are So Good!”Ye Zhuo gave old Mrs. Cen a thumbs-up.

“”Of course, if I’m Not Awesome, who’s Awesome?”If the Cen Old Lady had a tail, at this moment, her tail would definitely be in the air.”

“Soon, the game screen entered.”

“This was the Cen old lady that Ye Zhuo invited, so the matches were all high-level heroes.”

“As soon as the Cen Old Lady left the house, she gloriously gave a drop of blood.”

“Old Lady Cen was furious. [ you damned monkey opposite me, just you wait! I’ll immediately get my granddaughter-in-law to avenge me! ]”

[ elementary school student? I’ll wait for revenge on the Lower Road! ]

“Just as Old Lady Cen was about to type, she was resurrected. She turned to look at ye Zao and used the most domineering tone to say the most cowardly words, “Ye, come with me. I don’t dare to go alone!”” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“”Okay.”After ye Zao finished harvesting Red Daddy in the wild area, he went to the Lower Road to meet old Mrs. Cen.”

“Seeing ye Zao coming over, Old Mrs. Cen was suddenly not afraid of anything. She ran over with her sprinting skill, “Damn monkey! Come here! Come here! Watch how I Kill You!””

“Seeing that the hero that old Mrs. Cen was controlling was already at critical HP, ye Zao directly used a skill and cast a second skill.”

Ko!

Old Mrs. Cen excitedly spun around on the spot and started typing again. [ how was it? is my granddaughter-in-law good? ]

“[ two against one, it was an unfair victory. ]”

“Old Mrs. Cen continued typing. [ grandma is standing right here. If you have the ability, bring your teammates over too! ]”

“Ten seconds later, monkey and his teammate, Ah Ke, walked over.”

Old Mrs. Cen was also at full HP.

“Ye Zao was on his way to a 1V2. “Grandma Cen, you go first. I’ll be right there.””

“”Okay.”With ye Zao’s words, Old Mrs. Cen was suddenly not afraid of anything.”

Because she knew that ye Zao would definitely save her.

“Sure enough, just as Old Mrs. Cen was about to give up, ye Zao came over.”

“”Double, Kill!””

Old Mrs. Cen was extremely excited. “Ahhh! I double killed! Monkey must be furious. He almost killed me just now!”

“The grandfather and grandson played games for a while, and in the blink of an eye, it was night time.”

Old Mrs. Cen stayed at the Cen House to have dinner.

“After dinner, old Mrs. Cen made a trip to the west courtyard.”

“Before she entered the courtyard, Old Mrs. Cen heard Buddhist music drifting in the wind.”

Old Mrs. Cen was stunned.

“When she heard that old Mrs. Lin was now a Buddhist, she felt that it was quite incredible.”

She didn’t expect it to be true.

This old lady actually believed in Buddhism.

It wasn’t easy.

It really wasn’t easy.

Old Lady Cen clicked her tongue and pushed open the courtyard door to walk in.

“Old Lady Cen.”Auntie Wang immediately came out to welcome her.

Old Lady Cen nodded. “Where’s Your Old Lady?”

“She’s in the temple hall. I’ll bring you there.”

“Okay.”

Sister-in-law Wang brought Old Mrs. Cen to the temple hall.

“Sandalwood incense curled up in the temple hall. Through a beaded curtain, one could see the bodhisattva worshiped inside.”

“Old Mrs. Lin was sitting on a wheelchair, tapping on a wooden fish.”

“Hearing footsteps, she looked up. “Bai Tang, you’re here.””

Old Mrs. Cen nodded. “I came to see you.”

Old Mrs. Lin smiled. “Thank you for coming to see me at a time like this.”

“If it was in the past, she would definitely have thought that old Mrs. Cen had come to laugh at her.”

But now.

She would not.

She only regretted that she had not heard what old Mrs. Cen had said.

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “I was worried that you would still be as stubborn and blind as before. Now it seems that you have really changed.””

Old Mrs. Cen never beat around the bush and said what she had to say.

“”Unfortunately, I woke up too late.”Old Mrs. Lin Sighed.”

“Old Mrs. Cen nodded, “It is indeed quite late, but it is better than being blind for the rest of your life! You Don’t even know how annoying you were in the past! You have to keep it up in the future! If you do it again, you will really be incurable!””

“Old Mrs. Lin raised her head to look at Old Mrs. Cen. “Don’t worry, I Won’t be blind again this time.””

“That’s good.”

The two chatted for a while more before old Mrs. Cen turned around and left.

“At ten o’clock in the evening, Old Mrs. Cen took a car back to the Cen Manor.”

“The lights in the living room were on. When Zhou Xiang heard the sound of footsteps, he immediately stood up. “Mom, why are you only back now? I was just about to call Zhuozhuo!””

“Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “It’s only ten o’clock, why are you in such a hurry! Oh right, I have something to show you.””

“Zhou xiang asked curiously, “What is it?””

Old Mrs. Cen mysteriously took out a roll of paper.

“What is this?”Zhou Xiang asked.

“Take a guess.”

“Zhou Xiang continued, “Is it a painting?””

“”You guessed right.”Old Mrs. Cen nodded and continued, “Go and tidy up the coffee table. I’ll open it for you to take a look.””

“Okay.”Zhou Xiang immediately went to tidy up the coffee table.

Old Mrs. Cen placed the painting on the coffee table.

A perfect ink painting appeared in front of Zhou Xiang.

An iron painting with a silver hook.

It was breathtaking.

Old Mrs. Cen liked Chinese paintings very much. She had a collection of many famous people’s authentic works. She even had some friendship with the elders of the Chinese art world.

“Zhou Xian looked at Old Mrs. Cen and asked curiously, “Mom, is there a new person in the Chinese art world?””
