“Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly and said in disdain, “How did the silly cat get fat again? Did you feed it canned food again?” ”

“Perhaps it was because he had wandered around before, but brother Meow did not feel full. He usually ate as much as he was given, and he ate like a pig before ye Zao came to Shunxi Financial Group. ”

“For the sake of brother Meow’s health, ye Zao specially ordered a set of healthy cat meals. ”

“However, Little White was afraid of starving brother Meow, so it often secretly fed brother Meow canned food. ”

It never changed.

“Hearing this, little white quickly shook its head and said, “No! I didn’t! Don’t talk nonsense!” ”

“Ye Zao continued, “Don’t feed the silly cat any more food! If I find out again, I’ll ask the butler to cut off the electricity for you.” ”

“”Don’t!”Xiao Bai immediately acted coquettishly, “Da Zao Zao, you are the best da Zao in the world, the most beautiful da Zao in the Universe...” ”

“Ye Zao stretched out a white finger and shook it gently, “I’m not Grandma Cen. This trick is useless!” ”

Only Old Lady Cen would be coaxed by Xiao Bai until she couldn’t find her bearings.

“As long as Xiao Bai said ‘the best Grandma in the Universe’, Old Lady Cen could even tell Xiao Bai the password to her bank card. ”

“Xiao Bai continued, “Alright, Alright! Just don’t feed her in the future! Great Burning, you go ahead! I’m Hanging Up!” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

Xiao Bai cut off the video.

“After hanging up the video, Xiao Bai turned on the search engine. ”

“Ten seconds later, Xiao Bai said excitedly, “Ah! I found it!” ”

“Meow!”Brother Meow responded very cooperatively.

“In the next second, little white slid into ye Langhua’s room and said sweetly, “Grandma!” ”

“Who is it?”Ye Langhua’s voice came from inside.

“It’s the universe’s most powerful little white!”

“Come in.”

Little White pushed the door open and entered.

“Ye langhua smiled and said, “Little White, is there something you need from me?” ”

“Little White said, “Grandma, I want a piece of clothing. Can you help me place an order?” ”

“What kind of clothing?”Ye Langhua asked curiously.

“Although Little White was a robot, ye Langhua had never thought of it as a robot because it had a super intelligent brain. ”

“Little White immediately switched the display screen on its head to the online shopping page. “Well, it’s the first one in the shopping cart.” ”

It was a very cute piece of clothing.

“There was a huge pocket on its chest. According to the shop’s introduction, this pocket could fit a cat. ”

Little White had also searched for a long time before finding this piece of clothing.

“”Grandma, Can you help me buy it?”Little White walked to ye Langhua’s side and rubbed her leg. “Dear beautiful grandma, you’re the Best!” ”

“Ye langhua smiled and said, “Sure, I’ll help you buy it. Isn’t it just a piece of clothing?” ”

“Yay! Long live Grandma!”

“Ye Langhua clicked on the order, and little white continued, “Grandma, remember to pick the fastest delivery method!” ”

“Okay.”Ye Langhua chose the delivery method today.

“Seeing that the order was successfully placed, Little White was so happy that it was about to cheer. “Thank you, Grandma! Grandma, you’re simply the best, most beautiful, and kindest good grandma in the world!” ”

“Ye langhua smiled and said, “If I buy you things, I will be the best grandma in the world. What if I don’t Buy You Things?” ” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“”Of course, I will be the best Grandma!” ”

It was the smartest robot in the world.

Want to trick it?

Impossible!

“Under Little White’s anticipation, the express delivery delivered the clothes at three in the afternoon. ”

“Little White opened the express delivery and impatiently put the clothes on its body. It opened the pocket on its chest and said, “Come, silly cat, jump in quickly.” ”

“Meow!”Brother Meow jumped in very cooperatively.

“Although brother Meow was very fat, it could barely fit in the big pocket. It just looked a little funny. ”

“”Meow, Meow, Meow!”Brother Meow looked up at Whitey and meowed a few times. ”

“Whitey said excitedly, “I know! I know! Let’s Go Right Now!” ”

“Meow!”Brother Meow was also very excited!

Little White’s operating system quickly slid out.

It was very fast.

It was so fast that only an afterimage was left.

“After dozens of seconds, it slid back backwards. “I almost forgot!” ”

“Meow?”Brother Meow raised his head with a face full of question marks.

“Little White quickly slid into the house, took a few cat cans and stuffed them into its pocket. “I almost forgot about the cat cans!” ”

“Seeing the cat cans that Little White was holding, brother Meow silently retracted his paw that was about to scratch someone. ”

“After putting the cans away, little white continued, “Silly cat, we have to set off now!” ”
