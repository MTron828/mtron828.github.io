Chapter 195: 089: Lin Jin city’s secret, the trap-digging brother Ze, domineering online! 1

Found it.

Finally found it.

Song Shiyu didn’t know how long he had been waiting for this day.

In countless pitch-black nights, he had relied on the last bit of light in his heart to slowly survive.

If it wasn’t for that beam of light.

He would have disappeared long ago.

The carriage was very quiet.

In a moment, Song Shiyu took out a big white rabbit milk candy from his pocket.

The familiar taste spread in his mouth.

Song Shiyu curled the corners of his lips. For the first time, he felt that being alive was not bad.

At least, it let him know once again that candy was sweet.

Song Shiyu raised his eyes to look at the apartment building that ye Zao lived in.

She had protected him when he was young.

......

In the future, it would be his turn to protect her.

After a very, very long time, the black car finally disappeared under the night sky.

Song Shiyu drove all the way to the song family’s sanatorium.

The Sanatorium was located in a quiet suburb.

There was no one within a few miles. There was a large forest in front of them. It was late at night, and only the street lamp in front of the sanatorium was lit up. The only sound in the air was the horrifying cry of an owl, it looked extremely eerie. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

It made one’s scalp tingle.

When they heard the sound of a car, a hunched-over old lady walked out. “Boss.”

It was a hoarse and unpleasant voice.

It was as if a sharp blade had scraped past it.

Song Shiyu nodded. “Aunt Zhao.”

Aunt Zhao handed song Shiyu a pair of white gloves.

Song Shiyu put on the gloves at an unhurried pace.

Under the lights in the room, it could be clearly seen that Aunt Zhao had a hideous scar on her face, which was shocking to look at. Her hands were also full of scars, and her little finger and thumb were incomplete.

The two of them walked to a bright room on the second floor one after another.

There was nothing in the room.

There was only a bed.

A chair.

The air was filled with the pungent smell of medicine.

A middle-aged woman with disheveled hair and a dirty face was curled up on the bed, looking around vigilantly.

When her gaze met song Shiyu’s, she shrieked in fear and covered her head with the blanket. Her entire body was trembling.

“Don’t be afraid. You can recover after this injection.”Song Shiyu picked up the needle beside him and squeezed out the excess air from the needle. His expression was very calm.

“No, no, no...”

The scene in front of him overlapped with the memories in Song Shiyu’s mind.

In the pitch-black room.

A young and beautiful woman held the needle and stood in front of a skinny youth. “If you’re sick, you have to be treated. Be Good. You’ll be fine after this injection.”

The next second.

The needle stabbed into his flesh crazily.

“Why don’t You Die!”

“You’re dead! My Son is the only heir of the song family!”

“Die! Die!”

The woman was like a madman who had lost control.

However, the young man who was curled up in the corner did not say a word.

His eyes were filled with forbearance.

When you are not strong enough, you can only endure.

Time will make you strong!

Thinking of this, the ruthlessness in song Shiyu’s eyes that had finally disappeared became ruthless at this moment. He stabbed the needle into the middle-aged woman’s arm.

The medicine in the needle was injected into the blood vessels bit by bit.

In a moment, song Shiyu threw the empty needle into the trash can beside him. “Has she taken the medicine on time these past few days?”

“I’ve fed her on time.”

Song Shiyu nodded slightly. “That’s good.”

After saying that, song Shiyu turned to look at the middle-aged woman. “By the way, there’s something you still don’t know. Song Zinian is gone.”

The middle-aged woman sat on the bed with a blank expression.

It was as if she didn’t understand what she was saying.

“Do you know how he went missing?”

Song Shiyu answered his own question. “He was just like my mother. He was burned to death by the fire. When the firemen arrived, the door was covered in his bloody handprints...”

At this point.

The middle-aged woman finally broke down and burst into tears. “Zinian! Zinian!”

“What? My respected stepmother, aren’t you going to continue pretending to be crazy?”

That’s right.

This middle-aged woman was song Shiyu’s stepmother.

Zheng Xiangyue.

When Zheng Xiangyue was young, she was one of the most talented women in Yun Jing. She was also very good-looking.

No one knew.

She seemed to be such a beautiful person, but her heart was rotten and extremely dark.

She had a strange habit.

Sadism.

In front of others, she was a good wife and stepmother.

When it was late at night.

She would show an ugly face.

Song Shiyu was very afraid of the night at that time.

The night covered all the ugly scenes.

Aunt Zhao was also one of the victims.
