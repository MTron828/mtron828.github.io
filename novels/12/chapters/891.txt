“After saying this, Cen Yuyan looked at Ye Zhuo. ”

Her eyes were full of pride.

“Next, she could only appreciate how unlucky ye Zhuo was. ”

“Song Chenyu was her best friend. Ye Zhuo deliberately made things difficult for song Chenyu, which was to make things difficult for her. ”

Although Cen Shaoqing had a total of four sisters.

Cen Shaoqing respected her the most.

Ye Zao would definitely die a horrible death.

Cen Shaoqing had better kick ye Zao.

At this moment.

PA —

A crisp slap sounded in the air.

Cen Yuyan’s head was hit hard and a bright red palm print instantly appeared on her left cheek.

It was extremely shocking.

Her eyes were dazzled and she was completely stunned.

She didn’t expect Cen Shaoqing to make a move on her.

She even thought that it was an illusion.

But the intense pain on her face reminded her that this wasn’t a dream.

“Why would cen Shaoqing make a move on her, this fourth sister! ”

The person who should be hit should be ye Zhuo.

There was a mistake.

Cen Shaoqing must have made a mistake.

“Shaoqing?”Cen Yuyan raised her head to look at Cen Shaoqing. “Look carefully at who I am! I am your fourth sister! The person who should be hit is there!”

“The one who should be slapped is you.”Cen Shaoqing held the Buddha bead with one hand and slapped Cen Yuyan with the other.

Cen Shaoqing did not leave any face for Cen Yuyan with this slap. He directly slapped Cen Yuyan until she fell to the ground and her entire face swelled up.

She was like a pig’s head and one could hardly see her original facial features.

Cen Yuyan was in so much pain that she could not even feel anything. Her ears buzzed.

“Ever since she was young, even Zhou Xiang had never slapped her. ”

But today.

Cen Shaoqing had slapped her twice in a row.

“Shaoqing...”Cen Yuyan raised her head and looked at Cen Shaoqing in disbelief.

Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads and looked down at Cen Yuyan. “Apologize to searing.”

Apologize?

Apologize to ye searing?

Make Her apologize to ye searing?

Did she hear wrongly?

On what basis?

What right did ye Luoluo have to accept her apology?

“”Shaoqing, what are you saying?”Cen Yuyan almost couldn’t find her voice. “I’m your sister! Your Own Sister!” ”

She was clearly Cen Shaoqing’s most respected sister.

How did things turn out like this?

“”I said, apologize to Luoluo unless she forgives you.”Cen Shaoqing’s voice was very faint, but there was a chill in it. “Otherwise, it won’t be as simple as two slaps.” ”

Cen Shaoqing was never a man who hit women.

But Ye Zhuo was his only bottom line.

If anyone dared to touch ye Zhuo.

Not to mention women.

“Even Cen Yuyan, his fourth sister who was related to him by blood, he would still hit them! ”

“Cen Yuyan was angry and in pain, her entire body was trembling. ”

She originally thought that Cen Shaoqing was only dealing with ye Zhuo.

“She didn’t expect Cen Shaoqing to actually hit her, his fourth sister, for Ye Zhuo. ”

It was a great humiliation!

“To Cen Yuyan, this was a great humiliation. ”

When had she ever been humiliated like this in her life?

“”Three, two...”Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips opened and he began to count down to three. There was not a trace of warmth on his cold white skin. ”

Cen Yuyan had never seen Cen Shaoqing like this.

He was so cold that it was terrifying.

He was like the Grim Reaper on the asura arena who was covered in blood. It made people shudder.

Cen Shaoqing had been a vegetarian for a long time.

Cen Yuyan had almost forgotten his true nature.

“He was originally a person whose hands were covered in blood, and his methods were so cold that it made people’s hair stand on end. ”

But Cen Yuyan did not expect that.

There would be a day.

The viciousness on Cen Shaoqing would target her.

They were blood-related siblings.

Did Cen Shaoqing not know that his elder sister was like a Mother?

“For the sake of Ye Zhuo, Cen Shaoqing had already disowned all his relatives? ”

“Just when Cen Shaoqing was about to say ‘three’, Cen Yuyan hurriedly said, “I’m Sorry, Zao Zao, I was wrong! I Won’t dare to do it again in the future! Please have the magnanimity to forgive me!” ”

Cen Yuyan was unable to imagine what unexpected things Cen Shaoqing would do next.

“At the moment, it was still more important to save his life. ”

“Cen Shaoqing turned his head to look at Ye Zao, and his thin lips lightly opened. “Leader, have you calmed down?” ”

“At this moment, CEN Shaoqing seemed to have changed into a completely different person. ”

The sinister look on his body instantly disappeared.

“If he had not seen it with his own eyes, who would believe that this was a person? ”

Leader?

Cen Shaoqing actually called ye Zao Leader!

Could it be that Cen Shaoqing was just putting on a show for ye Zao?

How could this be?

How could Cen Shaoqing fall in love with Ye Zao?

It was clearly old Madam Cen who forced Cen Shaoqing to be together with ye Zao.

What the hell is going on?

Cen Yuyan’s downcast eyes are full of unwillingness.
