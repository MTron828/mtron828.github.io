Definitely Not!

Old Lady Cen was still laughing at Old Lady Lin.

Where did she get her face from?

“If Old Lady Cen continued like this, she would sooner or later bring disaster to the entire Cen family. ”

“At that time, she would be the sinner of the entire Cen family! ”

“Cen Shaoqing did not like ye Zao at all, but Old Lady Cen insisted on forcing Cen Shaoqing to be with ye Zao with her death. ”

It was not sweet to force things.

“If this continued, something bad would happen sooner or later. ”

This was simply luring a wolf into the house!

“Unfortunately, Old Mrs. Cen could only see other people’s shortcomings and could not see her own shortcomings at all. ”

“Cen Yuyan put down the yogurt in her hand and looked at Old Mrs. Cen, “Grandma, have you ever thought about why Grandma Lin would rather help an outsider like Feng Xianxian than help her own granddaughter? Is this really Grandma Lin’s fault alone? This fly doesn’t even bite a seamless egg.” ”

It was clearly ye Zhuo’s fault.

It had a little to do with Old Lady Lin?

“If Old Lady Lin was really that muddle-headed, then would all her sons be so promising? ”

“Old Lady Cen said directly, “Because there’s something wrong with her brain!” ”

“Cen Yuyan smiled and said, “But I think Grandma Lin is quite clear-headed.” ”

Clear-headed?

“If Old Lady Lin was clear-headed, then there would be no one in this world who understood! ”

Old Madam Cen could hear the hidden meaning in Cen Yuyan’s words and narrowed her eyes. “What do you mean by this strange tone?”

“”I don’t mean anything.”Cen Yuyan smiled. “Grandma, you’re thinking too much.” ”

“Old Madam Cen looked at Cen Yuyan, with a straight face, she said, “Fourth brother, what are you thinking about? Your Grandma’s heart is like a mirror! I don’t want to meddle in the matter between you and that fish, and I don’t want to ask! But if you dare to have designs on my granddaughter-in-law, then don’t blame me for being impolite! I’m not that muddle-headed Zhao fangyue!” ”

Old Lady Cen was not a fool. She knew Cen Yuyan’s scheming ways too well.

“In fact, Cen Yuyan was just stupid. ”

She did not know that she was being played by Song Chenyu.

“Cen Yuyan frowned. “Grandma, I really didn’t mean anything else! You’re thinking too much! Also, don’t talk about Chenyu like that. Isn’t Chenyu pretty good? Why do you have such a deep opinion of her?” ”

Cen Yuyan could not understand.

Song Chenyu was loved by everyone and was a famous celebrity. He had never done anything that old Mrs. Cen disliked. Why did old Mrs. Cen have such a deep opinion of Song Chenyu?

Could it be that someone was trying to sow discord in front of old Mrs. Cen?

If that was really the case...

Then it was very obvious who the person trying to sow discord was.

In the CEN family.

Who Did Song Chenyu threaten the most?

“Ye Zhuo, of course! ”

“After all, Song Chenyu had almost gotten together with CEN Shaoqing. ”

“Moreover, before ye Zhuo appeared, Zhou Xiang had a good impression of Song Chenyu. ”

“Although old Madam Lin did not like song Chenyu very much, she did not dislike song Chenyu. ”

What about now? Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Ever since ye Zao appeared, even Zhou Xiang’s attitude towards song Chenyu had changed. ”

One had to know that Zhou Xiang was originally a loyal fan of Song Chenyu.

“Now, in the entire Cen family, who else could see song Chenyu? ”

“The more Cen Yuyan thought about it, the more she felt that this was the case. She looked at Old Madam Cen and asked, “Grandmother, tell me the truth. Did someone sow discord between you and Chenyu?” ”

“When she heard this, old Mrs. Cen’s expression immediately changed. She pointed at Cen Yuyan and said, ”

“”Do you think everyone is you? All you do is gossip behind other people’s backs all day long! And you’re a highly educated person! I saw that your books were all read into the stomach of a dog! “Eh, I have my own eyes. I could tell at a glance what kind of person that fish is! “It’s not like you, blind at such a young age!” ”

“Cen Yuyan tried her best to control her emotions. “Grandma, what did Chenyu do to offend you?” ”

“She didn’t do anything to offend me!”

“Cen Yuyan immediately asked, “Then why do you have such a deep opinion of her?” ”

Old Mrs. Cen placed her hands on her hips. “Because your grandma is an expert in judging whores!”

“Song Chenyu was a white lotus flower that was full of bitchiness. With a glance, she could see her true nature. ”

Song Chenyu was Cen Yuyan’s best friend.

“Hearing Old Mrs. Cen say this about Song Chenyu, Cen Yuyan’s expression immediately darkened. “Grandmother! I won’t allow you to say this about Chenyu!” ”

“”You’re not a good person either!”Old Mrs. Cen said, “You’re already in your thirties and can’t even be compared to a three-year-old child. You only know how to hold the stinky feet of that fish all day long. You treat her as a good friend, so what does she treat you as? She treats you like a monkey! “No, you’re not even as good as a monkey. You’re a stepping stone under her feet!” ”
