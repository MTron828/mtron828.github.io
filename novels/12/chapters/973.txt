Zhou Mai looked up and smiled. “Weiyue came to visit your aunt again?”

“Xi Weiyue nodded. “I came by to see you. By the way, this is the pastry that I just bought. You can try it.” ”

“Although Zhou Mai had been wandering, she was dressed cleanly and spoke elegantly. She did not look like a vagabond at all. She took the pastry that Xi Weiyue handed over with both hands. “Thank you, Weiyue.” ”

“XI weiyue said, “Sister Mai, you’re too kind.” ”

“Zhou Mai turned to look at Aunt Lang and smiled. “Your Weiyue is really sensible.”Although she was not aunt Lang’s biological daughter, she was not inferior to her biological daughter at all. Although she was born into a wealthy family.., she had never looked down on people like them. ”

Zhou Mai had a very good impression of Xi Weiyue.

“Aunt Lang smiled and said, “This child has been sensible since she was young.” ”

“When she heard this, Xi Weiyue’s eyes flashed with a sarcastic light. ”

So what if she was sensible?

“Even if she was sensible, she could not replace ye Banyue’s position in ye Langhua’s heart. Ye Langhua could never treat her as his own daughter. ”

“Her eyes flashed, and Xi Weiyue said a little embarrassedly, “Aunt, sister Mai, I’m not as sensible as you say!” ”

“Zhou mai continued, “Since Weiyue is here, then Aunt Lang, you should go back with Weiyue.” ”

“Aunt Lang nodded and held Xi Weiyue’s hand. “Then, we’ll go back first.” ”

“Okay.”

Xi Weiyue turned around and greeted Zhou Mai before she and Aunt Lang walked towards the direction of half a month. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Xi Weiyue held Aunt Lang’s hand tightly and said affectionately, “Aunt, I heard from Xiao Mei that you’ve been taking your medicine on time these few days and your health has improved a lot. You must keep it up and don’t let me worry.” ”

“Aunt Lang nodded. “Don’t worry, I Won’t let you worry anymore in the future.”She had to live well and live a healthy life so that she could reunite with her little half moon. ”

“Xi Wei narrowed her eyes and continued, “Right, aunt, my father seems to have found out about Sister Half Moon.” ”

“Really?”Aunt Lang’s originally calm mood suddenly became agitated.

“Xi Weiyue nodded. “Of course it’s true! I know that you haven’t given up on looking for half moon sister all these years. My father is the same. Last night, I personally heard my father talking about half moon sister on the phone.” ”

“At present, Yang Jiao had already found a suitable person to impersonate half moon at the aid station. Some things had to be pre-prepared, otherwise, she would suddenly find someone to bring it to ye Langhua without any foreshadowing, ye Langhua would not believe it. ”

“”Then, did your father say where half a month is?”Aunt Lang followed up with a question. ”

“Xi Weiyue shook her head. “Not yet, but don’t worry. My father never does things that he’s not sure of. Just wait for him to bring sister half a month to you intact.” ”

Aunt Lang took out her phone from her pocket. “What’s Your Father’s number? I want to ask your father personally.”

Xi Weiyue took out her phone and dialed Xi Muwen’s number. “Let me do it.”

“Very soon, the call went through. “Hello, father, aunt has something to tell you.” ”

“After that, Xi Weiyue handed the phone to Aunt Lang. ”

“Aunt Lang said in a raspy voice, “You, you have news about half a month?” ”

“Regarding this matter, Xi Weiyue had talked to her before. XI muwen said, “Did Weiyue tell you?” ”

“Yes.”

“Xi Muwen sighed on the other end of the phone, “This child, didn’t I say not to tell you for the time being? She just can’t hide it! “Langhua, don’t worry. Little Half Moon is our biological child. I Won’t give up on her no matter what! “All these years, I’ve been thinking about her all the time. I do have some news now, but I’m not sure if it’s little half moon. When I have reliable news, I’ll inform you immediately.” ”

Xi Muwen was a father who was overly worried about his daughter.

No one could have imagined that Xi Muwen on the other end of the phone would say this with a dark expression.

It had been more than thirty years.

“This was the first time ye Langhua had taken the initiative to call him, and it was for the matter of half a month. ”

“With him around, did ye Langhua want to find that bastard? ”

In her dreams!

“Aunt Lang nodded. “Alright, then you must let me know if you have any news.” ”

A tiger would never eat its own son.

“At this moment, Aunt Lang had never expected that this person would be so much more ruthless than a tiger or a beast. ”

“”Don’t worry, you are the child’s mother. I will definitely tell you.” ”
