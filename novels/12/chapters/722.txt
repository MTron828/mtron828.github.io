Translator: 549690339

“Chenyu...”

“Song Chenyu continued, “Alright, stop talking. That’s it. See You Tomorrow.” ”

“Looking at the phone that was hung up, Lu Xiu’s eyes were filled with loneliness. ”

He had liked song Chenyu for many years.

He liked him very much.

“But now, Song Chenyu had given up on their relationship for Cen Yuyan. ”

“Since this was song Chenyu’s choice, he could only respect it. ”

“In his memory, song Chenyu was very kind. If he ignored song Chenyu’s feelings and directly told Cen Yuyan about his intentions, song Chenyu would definitely not forgive him. ”

“After all, Cen Yuyan was song Chenyu’s best friend. ”

“In the blink of an eye, the next day arrived. ”

The second day of the first month.

“In the morning, ye Zao had just gotten up to change when someone knocked on his room door. ”

Ye Zao walked over to open the door.

It was Lin Ze.

“Brother.”

“Lin Ze said, “Zao, what are you doing today?” ”

“”Nothing major,”ye Zao said. ”

“Lin Ze continued, “I have three friends who want to meet you.” ”

“Ye Zao nodded. “Sure, when do you want to meet?” ”

Lin Ze did not expect ye Zao to agree so quickly. “10 a.m.”

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded.

“The three friends that Lin Ze referred to were Li Wen, dog er, and fat tiger. ”

The three of them agreed to meet at the coffee shop at ten in the morning.

“Although it was only nine in the morning, the three of them couldn’t wait to go to the coffee shop and wait for Lin Ze. ”

The three of them were too curious about who Lin Ze’s sister was.

“Although Lin Ze had already said that ye Zao was his sister, the three of them didn’t quite believe it. ”

How could there be such a coincidence in this world?

It just so happened that ye Zhuo and Lin Ze looked a little alike. Ye Zhuo was Lin Ze’s sister?

“At this moment, the three of them were especially excited. ”

“Li Wen said, “Can you guys tell us who brother Ze’s sister is?” ”

“Dog two said, “I saw a picture of brother Ze walking together with the school Belle on the school forum before. Then, the comments below all said that the joke was brother Ze’s sister. Do you guys think that the school Belle is really brother Ze’s sister?” ”

“Fat tiger said, “I think the possibility is a little low.” ”

Li Wen looked at his watch and was a little anxious. “Why isn’t it 10 o’clock Yet?”

“After waiting for so long, it was finally 9:50. ”

“Li Wen saw a familiar figure through the glass window and said excitedly, “Look! Brother ZE is here!” ”

Dog Two and fat tiger stood up excitedly and looked out of the window.

“They saw a thin, long-haired girl beside Lin Ze. She looked very quiet and quiet. From a distance, they couldn’t see her face clearly. ”

“Fat tiger said, “That’s our sister, right?” ”

“It must be! It must be!”

“Li Wen smiled and said, “Brother Ze was bragging before that our sister is the campus Belle!” ”

“Although the girl beside Lin Ze was also very beautiful, compared to ye Zao, the campus belle of Beijing University, she was not just a little inferior. ”

“At this moment, Lin Ze pushed open the door and entered. ”

“Fat Tiger immediately stood up and waved at Lin Ze. “Brother Ze, this way!” ”

Lin Ze walked over.

The girl next to him walked to the other side.

“Li Wen said in surprise, “Isn’t our sister coming over to sit?” ”

Dog Two and fat tiger were also very puzzled.

“What sister?”Lin Ze looked up at Li Wen.

“Li Wen pointed over there and said, “Isn’t that our sister?” ”

Lin Ze shook his head. “I don’t know her.”

They just happened to enter the house together. They didn’t know each other at all.

They didn’t know each other?

They actually didn’t know each other!

“Li Wen was even more confused. He continued, “Brother Ze, didn’t we agree to bring our sister over to meet us today? Why did you come alone? Are you not going to bring your sister to meet us?” ”

“Not only was Li Wen disappointed that he didn’t see his sister, but dog two and fat tiger were also disappointed. ”

“Fat Tiger said, “Brother Ze, we clearly agreed on something. You Won’t go back on your word, right?” ”

“None of the three of them had a sister. Lin Ze had a sister, so the three of them were as rare as anything else. They had long wanted to see what ye Zao looked like, but unfortunately, they had never found a suitable time to meet him. ”

“They had finally agreed on a time, and now Lin Ze had stood them up again. ”

“Lin Ze raised his head slightly. “Don’t worry, I’m not lying to you! My sister just met a high school classmate over there. He should be here soon.” ”

“Hearing this, the three of them heaved a sigh of relief. ”

“Dog Two handed the menu to Lin Ze. “Brother Ze, you can order the drinks first. The three of us have already ordered.” ”

“Lin Ze took the menu and ordered five desserts, a cappuccino, and a cup of Blue Mountain Coffee. ”

“Dog two asked curiously, “Brother Ze, didn’t you say that you don’t like desserts? Why did you order so many desserts?” ”

“My sister likes them.”

My sister likes them?

TSK TSK TSK.

The three of them looked at each other and saw the mockery in each other’s eyes.

“Previously, Lin Ze had been very resistant to his sister’s existence. ”

“Now, he knew how to help his sister order dessert. ”

It seemed that Lin Ze wasn’t far from being a sis-con.

“Dog two asked curiously, “Brother Ze, are you and Your Sister Really Twins?” ”

Lin Ze nodded.

“Li Wen said, “Then you must look very similar to your sister.” ”

Fat Tiger nodded as well.

“Lin Ze looked up and said very seriously, “Ye Zhuo is my sister.” ”

“”Brother Ze, are you talking about the school Belle?”Fat Tiger asked. ”

Lin Ze nodded.

“”Stop bragging!”Li Wen continued, “Last time, we just said it casually. Brother Ze, you really took it seriously!” ”

“At this moment, the door of the cafe was pushed open again. ”

Lin Ze looked out of the door and smiled slightly. “My sister is here.”

“My Sister Is Here?”

The three of them looked up.

A slender figure walked in from the door. She was wearing a beige coat and a pair of Martin boots. She looked very imposing when she walked.

She was wearing an english-style hat. The wide brim of the hat covered her eyes and eyebrows. Only her fair chin and red lips could be seen.

“Although her face could not be seen, she gave off a powerful aura. ”

“This, this was really the school belle? ”

The three of them were stunned.

Ye Zao walked over. “Brother.”

“Lin Ze introduced them to Ye Zao. “The three of them are my best friends. This is Fat Tiger, this is Mozzie, and this is dog two. This is my sister, Ye Zao.” ”

Ye Zao! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

It was really ye Zao!

The three of them felt that it was very surreal. No one had expected that Lin Ze was not bragging at all. Ye Zao was his sister.

Only when ye Zao sat down did the three of them realize that it was not fake.

Ye Zao was really Lin Ze’s sister!

“Fat Tiger was still in disbelief. “Sister, are you really brother Ze’s sister?” ”
