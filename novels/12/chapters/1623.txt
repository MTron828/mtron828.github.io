“When he walked to the rest area, he happened to bump into Yu Zifei.”

“Although old Nie had betrayed ye Zhuo before, he was still Yu Zifei’s teacher after all. Yu Zifei still greeted him politely, “Teacher!””

Old Nie was happy today. He was too lazy to argue about the past with Yu Zifei and nodded with a smile.

“”Teacher, are you in a good mood today?”Yu Zifei asked.”

“Old Nie looked at Yu Zifei and continued, “Zifei, are you still in Miss Ye’s aircraft carrier project team?””

“Yes.”Yu Zifei nodded.

“Old Nie glanced at Yu Zifei, then he said, “Zifei, you and I are master and disciple. On account of our past friendship, I won’t argue with you about the past! “As long as you apologize to me, let bygones be bygones! “Although the aircraft carrier’s launch ceremony is about to start, it’s still not too late for you to withdraw now. You should take this opportunity to quickly withdraw. I’ll go and Tell Miss Tang to let you join the Tang family’s laboratory!””

“”Teacher, I appreciate your kindness. I’ll still say what I said. I believe in Miss Ye.”Yu Zifei had applied to join when old NIE had withdrawn from the aircraft carrier project team.”

“Since he chose to join at such a critical moment, it meant that he trusted ye Zao enough.”

Ye Zao was a very thoughtful and courageous person. Yu Zifei wanted to make a name for himself by following behind ye Zao!

“Moreover, Yu Zifei had always been very grateful to ye Zao.”

“Back then, old Nie suddenly betrayed and left the aircraft carrier project team. If it were anyone else, they would definitely vent their anger on him and reject his application.”

“Who would have thought that not only did ye Zhuo not doubt his motives, he even told him to do a good job.”

Yu Zifei would remember ye Zhuo’s words for the rest of his life.

“Old Nie raised his head and looked at Yu Zifei. His gaze was as if he was looking at a fool. He continued, “Yu Zifei! Don’t you know what’s good for you. I’m only saying these things to you because we’re master and Disciple!””

What the hell!

Old Nie hated people who didn’t know what was good for them and climbed up the ladder!

“He was already like this, yet Yu Zifei still didn’t know what was good for him.”

“Yu Zifei continued, “Teacher, I know you’re thinking of me, but I don’t want to leave Area C. even if the aircraft carrier plan fails, I won’t regret it.””

“A dog biting Lu Dongbin doesn’t know how to appreciate a good person!”Old Nie snorted. “You’re more regretful than me!”

“”Teacher, I won’t regret it.”A man’s words held great weight.”

What was the point of going back on his words?

Old Nie turned around and left.

“After taking a few steps, old nie turned around. “Yu Zifei, if you cry in front of me in a few days and say something regretful, don’t blame me for not taking into account the relationship between master and Disciple!””

“At that time, not to mention crying, even if Yu Zifei knelt on the ground and begged him, he wouldn’t sympathize with Yu Zifei.”

“”Don’t worry, teacher, that day will not come!”Yu Zifei said with a smile.”

Old Nie was so angry that his face was red. He walked forward without looking back.

Yu Zifei looked at old Nie’s back and touched his nose.

“Zifei!” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“At this moment, a female voice sounded in the air.”

“Pandi.”Yu Zifei turned his head.

“Zhang Pandi walked over from the side and said with a smile, “Was your teacher looking for you just now?””

“Yes.”Yu Zifei nodded.

“Zhang Pandi continued, “Did he tell you to leave the Big C area and go to Miss Tang’s laboratory?””

“Yes.”

“Did you agree?”Zhang Pandi asked.

“”No.”Yu Zifei did not hide anything and directly shook his head. “Pandi, you know that no matter what, I will not betray Miss Ye.””

“Ye Zao had trusted him so much back then. If he betrayed ye Zao, wouldn’t that make ye Zao’s heart turn cold?”

“Zhang Pandi frowned, “Do you know that the base is about to be taken over by C Nation? !”! “I heard that Miss Tang is highly appreciated by C Nation’s headquarters. In the future, Miss Tang will be the base’s agent and the head of the base!”! “If you can join the Tang family’s laboratory at this time, you won’t be far from the management level!”! “Hurry up and apologize to your teacher and ask him to forgive you!””

“After saying that, Zhang Pandi continued, “It’s best if you can also let me join the Tang family’s laboratory!””

Zhang Pandi also wanted to join the Tang family’s laboratory.

“Unfortunately, the Tang family’s laboratory was already full.”

“Pandi! What are you talking about!”Yu Zifei looked at Zhang Pandi in disbelief.

“”Don’t you understand what I’m saying?”Zhang Pandi was also a little angry, “A wise man submits to circumstances! Don’t you know how many people don’t have the means to curry favor with Miss Tang recently? Yet, you threw away the fat meat that was delivered to your door!””

“Speaking up to this point, Zhang Pandi lowered her voice, then, she said, “I’m 28 years old, and you’re over 30 years old. We’ve been in the base for so long, but we’ve always been like this. Aren’t you worried at all? “If you think I’m your girlfriend, go find teacher Nie right now and apologize to him properly. Ask him to arrange for both of us to go over to miss Tang’s side.””
