“Groom ye Shu?”Si lui frowned slightly. “I think ye Langhua Will Groom ye Zao as her successor.”

Ye Zao had a good background.

He was still the Dr. YC of the science and technology industry.

“Ye Shu was old after all. Although she was ye Langhua’s daughter, she did not receive any good education. ”

Anyone with a discerning eye would know that they should choose ye Zao instead of ye Shu.

“Zhao Xueyin nodded. “Big Brother Si, you’re right.” ”

“Si lui continued, “Xueyin, if there’s nothing else, I’ll be leaving first.” ”

“I’ll go with you.”Zhao Xueyin followed Si Lui’s footsteps.

The two of them walked to the office building together.

Si lui looked at Zhao Xueyin. “How is Uncle doing recently? is he feeling better?”

Zhao Xueyin sighed. “He’s still the same.”

“Father Zhao’s health hadn’t been very good all these years, but fortunately, Zhao Xueyin was a good person and didn’t worry about the Shunxi Financial Group. ”

“The lawyer frowned and said, “I happen to be free today. I’ll go with you to visit uncle.” ”

“Okay.”Zhao Xueyin nodded.

The two of them arrived at the Zhao residence together.

“Before they entered the main gate, they heard a cough coming from inside. ”

“Zhao Xueyin immediately trotted over and patted father Zhao’s back. “Dad, are you alright?” ”

“”I’m fine, I’m fine.”Father Zhao waved his hand and looked up to see the lawyer. He smiled and said, “Ah Lui is here!” ”

“Uncle.”The lawyer immediately walked over.

“Father Zhao continued, “I haven’t seen you for a long time. You’ve been quite busy recently, haven’t you?” ”

“”I’m Alright, I’m not very busy.” ”

“Father Zhao patted Si Lu’s hand. “I’ll have to trouble you with the consortium! Oh right, I heard that ye Langhua sent someone over. What about that person?” ”

“Si Lu said, “The situation is quite complicated. Ye Langhua has now removed her identity as the heir, and now XI Weiyue has been sent back.” ”

Father Zhao was stunned.

He subconsciously felt that something was not right.

“”What’s going on? Tell me about it.”After he said that, Father Zhao looked at Zhao Xueyin. “Xueyin, go and make a cup of tea for Ah Lui.” ”

“Zhao Xueyin nodded. “Okay, Dad.” ”

Father Zhao held the lawyer’s hand and asked in detail about ye Langhua.

The lawyer explained in a concise manner.

“Hearing that, Father Zhao narrowed his eyes and said, “You’re saying that ye Langhua now has a grandson and a granddaughter? Both of them are related?” ”

“”Yes.”Si Lu continued, “Ye Langhua is now interested in training his granddaughter to enter the Financial Group.” ”

Father Zhao waved his hand. “She’s just a little girl. There’s nothing to be afraid of!”

“After saying this, father Zhao continued, “You just said that ye Langhua’s grandson is the top scorer in the college entrance examination of the Capital University?” ”

“”Yes.”Si Lu nodded. He could see the loneliness in father Zhao’s eyes and continued, “Uncle, Xue Yin’s aptitude is not inferior to ye Langhua’s grandson at all. You Don’t have to worry about this problem!” ”

“Hearing this, Father Zhao’s face finally had a smile on it. ” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The luckiest thing in his life was to have a good daughter.

“Zhao Xueyin was very outstanding. Ever since she was young, she had never made him worry about her. ”

“Now, she was only 26 years old, but she was already an existence that Shunxi Financial Group held its own! ”

Shunxi Financial Group had three founders.

“They were Old Master Ye, Old Zhang, and him. ”

“Old Master Ye only had one daughter, ye Langhua, but ye Langhua was a failure. She was obviously very talented, but she was ruined by a man. ”

Old Zhang had no children in his entire life.

How could these two compete with him?

“In the end, Shunxi Financial Group could only become the Zhao family’s possession. ”

“But now, ye Langhua actually had a pair of grandsons and granddaughters, ”

this made father Zhao a little fearful.

“Thinking of this, Father Zhao sighed again. “If only Xueyin was a boy.” ”

Zhao Xueyin was good at everything.

The only drawback was that she was not a boy.

Having a daughter like Zhao Xueyin was Father Zhao’s greatest fortune in this life.

“Zhao Xueyin was not a boy, and it was also Father Zhao’s greatest regret in this life! ”

“Si lui said, “Uncle, what are you saying? Although Xueyin is a girl, she is not inferior to a boy at all. Even I feel inferior in front of her!” ”

“Father Zhao smiled bitterly and said, “Ah Lui, don’t try to comfort me! No matter how good this girl is, she can’t be compared to a boy!” ”

Girls were always girls.

It was said that having a boy would carry on the family line.

Who said that having a girl would carry on the family line?

“Since ancient times, everyone called girls money-losing goods. ”

How many people called boys money-losing goods?

“Father Zhao came from that era, and some of his thoughts were already deeply ingrained. ”
