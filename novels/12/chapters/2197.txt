“As for Man Fei, he was on par with man Wen. In fact, he was even worse than man Wen. ”

“If those people outside had not come for her, would they have come for one of the three of them? ”

That was impossible!

“After all, Shi Qingcheng was her teacher, and she was on good terms with Leo and Mr. Feng. What did the three of them have to do with those big shots outside? ”

“Master Cao immediately understood what Manxing meant. He nodded and said, “That’s fine too.” ”

It was indeed better to have them take the initiative to support Manxing than for Manxing to take the initiative to flatter him.

“At this moment, the sound of footsteps came from outside the hall. ” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

A group of people entered from the outside.

They sat quietly at the side.

“The discussion was a little quieter, but it still existed. ”

“I heard that Miss Shi from the Blue Ocean nation was Miss Manxing’s teacher in school.”

“”If that’s the case, could it be that Miss Shi is here for Miss Manxing?” ”

“”Miss Manxing is so outstanding, it’s normal for Miss Shi to support her. In this world, how many teachers don’t want their students to be outstanding?” ”

“You’re right.”

“Then what about clan leader Leo? Who is clan leader Leo here for?”

“Hearing this, Manzaibang sat up straight and coughed lightly. ”

Nonsense.

“Of course, clan leader Leo was here for him. ”

Did these people have any discerning eyes?

“Man Zai Bang stood up from his chair and walked towards Leo. “Hello, clan leader Leo. I’m flattered that you can participate in my election despite being so busy!” ”

“Leo looked at man Zai Bang in front of him and couldn’t remember who he was. At this moment, he suddenly thought of someone. “You, you are Shen Dali’s brother-in-law?” ”

“Hearing this, man Zai Bang hurriedly nodded. “Yes, yes, yes. I Am Shen Dali’s brother-in-law. My name is man Zai Bang.” ”

Leo indeed had some friendship with Shen Dali. He smiled and greeted him. “Hello.”

“Seeing Leo smile at him, man Zai Bang became even more confident. ”

Leo was definitely here to help him.

“MAN XING only had one helper, Shi Qingcheng, and he had a group. After all, Leo, Mr. Feng, Ye Han, and the JY team were all good friends, so these people were all brought over by Leo to support him. ”

“Seeing this scene, man Xing frowned slightly. ”

Could it be that Leo was really here to help man zaibang?

“If that was really the case, things would be a little troublesome. ”

“But fortunately, she was sometimes Qingcheng. ”

“If it wasn’t for Shi Qingcheng Coming, man Zaibang’s two-and-a-half-hundred-and-a-half might really be a bit of a threat. ”

“Seeing the people who suddenly appeared in the hall, Fan Mu said with some envy, “Man Wen, look, your sister and man Zaibang’s backer are all here! What are you going to do? The election is about to start.” ”

Man Wen did not say anything and just looked at the election platform.

“Wen Yang continued, “It’s impossible for Miss Ye to come!” ”

“Speaking up to this point, Wen Yang sighed. ”

He felt that ye Zhuo was quite heartless. He could clearly find out what man Wen had done for her.

But Ye Zhuo did not show any reaction at all.

“The man family owed ye Zhuo a lot of things, but man Wen did not owe ye Zhuo anything. ”

These things were not what man Wen should have done for ye Zao.

Man Wen was a good brother.

But Ye Zao’s attitude was a little disappointing.

“No matter what, she should not sit idly by. ”

Soon.

The auspicious time for the election arrived.

The host came to the stage to deliver a speech.

“The person who held the position of Supporter was the vice president of the General Alliance. After saying some opening words, it was time for the online voting. ”

The voting was open and fair.

The numbers on the screen kept rolling.

“Watching the changing numbers, the atmosphere gradually became tense. ”

The Manchu star had always been in the lead.

The Manchu star was at the bottom.

“1,123,2,256,7,789... ”

“In just a few seconds, the Manchu star had directly surpassed the Manchu Star by ten times. ”

“At this moment, Manwen was still at 5,520, while Manxing was already at 55,220. ”

Manxing sat on the chair without any expression on her face.

This was just the beginning.

“Just as master Cao had said, her glory would never stop at Manxing. ”

“If she started to get excited now, what would she do in the future? ”

“But at this moment, Manwen, who was originally in last place, seemed to be on steroids as her votes continued to rise. ”

“22,569,54,896,77,586,2036,111... ”

“In the end, he was only one vote behind the 400,000 votes of the full stars. When the counter stopped, the two of them were tied. ”

“Thus, the situation became like this. The full stars were tied for first place, second place in the full stars, and third place in the full stars. ”

No one expected Manwen’s votes to suddenly rise!

“Even fan mu had not expected it. He looked at Manwen in disbelief. “Brother, what did you do?” ”
