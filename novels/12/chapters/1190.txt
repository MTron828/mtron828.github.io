On the other side.

“Father Zhao had just walked into his office when he received a call. “”Really?”” ”

“””Alright, I’ll be there right away!”” ”

“After hanging up, Father Zhao could not care about anything else and immediately ran downstairs. ”

“When he reached downstairs, he saw Butler elder Zhang standing in front of the car. “”Master!”” ”

“Father Zhao asked impatiently, “”Where is he now?”” ”

“””At the hospital.”” ”

“””Take me there immediately!”” ”

“Old Zhang opened the car door. “”Then get in the car quickly.”” ”

Father Zhao got into the car.

“After getting into the car, Father Zhao kept urging the driver to drive faster. ”

“The driver turned around and said, “”Master, it’s already the fastest we can go.”” ”

“Old Zhang said, “”Master, don’t be anxious. We’ll be there soon.”” ”

Not worried?

How could he not be worried?

He had been waiting for this day for far too long.

“Father Zhao continued, “”Where did you find a Ye?”” ”

“Old Zhang said, “”It’s a coincidence. Da Cai had a small accident on the highway last night. I went to the hospital to see him this morning and happened to see the young master in the same ward! I saw that the young master’s eyes and brows looked very similar to yours, so I tactfully asked about his background. He said that he was an orphan... . .”” ” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Hearing this, Zhao’s father cried out. ”

Got It!

Finally!

“After all these years, he finally found his son. ”

“Seeing Father Zhao like this, old Zhang sighed, “”Master, don’t be sad, aren’t we going to see the young master now?”” ”

“””You don’t understand! I’m happy! Happy!””Father Zhao beat his chest excitedly, “”I have a son! I, Zhao Zhenfei, finally have a son! My Zhao family is finally not extinct! Drive faster, old MA, drive faster!”” ”

Father Zhao could not wait to fly to the hospital.

“””Old Ma, why did you stop?”” ”

“The driver, old MA, said, “”There’s a red light ahead.”” ”

“””Go! Go straight through! If anything happens, I’ll take responsibility!””Nothing was more important than seeing his son. ”

Old Ma could only go through the red light.

“He sped up and finally, half an hour later, the car stopped at the entrance of the hospital. ”

“After getting out of the car, Father Zhao’s legs were weak. ”

He was too excited!

Old Zhang helped Father Zhao into the inpatient department.

“Through the door, Father Zhao saw a middle-aged man lying on the bed. ”

His figure was thin.

There was indeed a trace of him between his brows.

“Father Zhao covered his mouth. “”It’s him! It’s a Ye!”” ”

“””Let’s go in and take a look!””Old Zhang said. ”

“””Okay.””Father Zhao nodded. ”

“When they arrived at the ward, Father Zhao grabbed the man’s hand and cried, “”A Ye! A Ye! Father has finally found you!”” ”

The middle-aged man lying on the bed was a little confused.

“At this moment, Father Zhao suddenly let go of the man’s hand and quickly grabbed his other hand to roll up his sleeve. ”

Nothing.

Nothing.

“Father Zhao said in disbelief, “”Nothing! How come there’s nothing!”” ”

“As a father, he would never forget the red birthmark on his son’s arm. ”

“He was worried that someone would make a fuss about it, so father Zhao never revealed that his son had a birthmark on his arm. ”

“Even the butler, Old Zhang, didn’t know. ”

“Old Zhang asked curiously, “”Master, what are you looking for?”” ”

“””It’s not a Ye, he’s not my a Ye...””father Zhao slid down the bed, his eyes gloomy. ”

Why did God treat him like this?

Why did he give him hope and disappoint him at the same time?

Why?

Father Zhao cried in despair.

Old Zhang frowned. How could Zhao Zhenfei tell that the person lying on the bed was not his son’s?

...

On Zhao Xueyin’s side.

“Ever since Lin Zhaoyang came to the Zhao family, there had been no other movements, which made Zhao Xueyin anxious. ”

What did master five mean?

She could not wait forever.

“If the mountain did not come, she would go. ”

“As Master Five’s chief assistant, Lin Zhaoyang must know what master five was thinking. ”

Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes and made a call to Lin Zhaoyang.

“When Lin Zhaoyang received Zhao Xueyin’s call, he immediately informed old master jin, “”Elder Jin, Zhao Xueyin asked me to meet her.”” ”

“Old Master Jin turned to look at Lin Chaoyang. “”When?”” ”

“Lin Chaoyang replied, “”Just now.”” ”

“Old Master Jin smiled and said, “”Zhao Xueyin finally can’t sit still anymore! Promise her, but the time and place will be up to you!”” ”

“Lin Chaoyang nodded. “”Then I’ll wait for your arrangements?”” ”

“””Yes.”” ”

“After saying this, Lin Chaoyang left the Jin family. ”

“After sending Lin Zhaoyang off, Grandpa Jin looked at Uncle Fu beside him. “”Go and help me with something.”” ”

“””Go ahead.”” ”

Grandpa Jin whispered into Uncle Fu’s ear.

“Hearing this, uncle fu said, “”Don’t worry, I will definitely handle this matter well.”” ”

“””Okay, go ahead.”” ”

Three days later.

Zhao Xueyin went to the place she had arranged with Lin Zhaoyang as promised.

It was a beautiful teahouse.

There was a beaded curtain between the tea table and the tea table.

“When Zhao Xueyin arrived, Lin Zhaoyang had not arrived yet. ”

“After waiting for about ten minutes, Lin Zhaoyang finally arrived. ”

“””Special Assistant Lin.””Zhao Xueyin stood up to greet him. ”

“Lin Zhaoyang said apologetically, “”I’m sorry, Miss Zhao. I’m ten minutes late.”” ”

“””It’s okay,””Zhao Xueyin said softly. “”I just got here anyway.”” ”

Being ten minutes late meant that fifth master was testing her.

“At a time like this, she obviously could not make things difficult for Lin Zhaoyang. ”

Just wait.

“Lin Zhaoyang was acting high and mighty now. When she became the fifth madam, Lin Zhaoyang would have a good ending. ”

“Thinking of this, the corners of Zhao Xueyin’s mouth curled up. ”

“Lin Chaoyang held the cup in front of him. “”Miss Zhao, I’ll replace the wine with tea first. I’ll punish myself with three cups.”” ”

“””Special Assistant Lin, you’re being too polite!”” ”

“The moment the lawyer entered the teahouse, he saw Zhao Xueyin sitting there. ”

“She was wearing a white dress, and the smile on her face was bright and moving. ”

The lawyer was just about to go up and greet her when he saw Lin Chaoyang sitting opposite her.

This was Master Five’s special assistant.

Perhaps they were discussing a collaboration.

“After some thought, the lawyer did not go up and disturb them. Instead, he chose a seat next to them and sat down. ”

“His and Zhao Xueyin’s seats were back to back, but there was a bead curtain between the seats. Zhao Xueyin could not see him, but he could hear their conversation. ”

“After drinking three cups of tea, Lin Zhaoyang continued, “”Miss Zhao, your boyfriend didn’t come with you today?”” ”

“””Boyfriend?””Zhao Xueyin said, “”I don’t have a boyfriend, Special Assistant Lin, are you mistaken?”” ”

“Lin Zhaoyang was stunned. “”Isn’t Mr. Lawyer of Your Financial Group your boyfriend?”” ”

“Hearing this, the lawyer’s heart raced. ”

His ears were also slightly red.

He was looking forward to Zhao Xueyin’s answer.

“Hearing this, Zhao Xueyin suddenly understood. ”

No wonder master five did not make any movements for a few days.

It was a misunderstanding.

He mistook the lawyer for her boyfriend.

“Zhao xueyin smiled and said, “”Special Assistant Lin, you misunderstood. The lawyer is not my boyfriend. We are not even ordinary friends. It has always been his wishful thinking.”” ”
