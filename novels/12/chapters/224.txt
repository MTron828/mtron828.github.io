Translator: 549690339

But this is also good.

“Tonight, tonight, she will let ye Zhuo know that a fake daughter should look like a fake daughter. ”

A fake daughter who occupies the magpie’s nest wants to compete with her?

She really overestimates herself!

“Shall we go in together?”Mu Yourong said.

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

The two of them walked side by side into the hotel.

“Originally, Mu Yourong was quite suitable to wear red. ”

“However, Ye Zao was standing beside her. ”

“The moment the two of them stepped into the hotel, they attracted everyone’s attention. ”

“Who is the person standing beside the eldest daughter of the Mu Family?”

“She’s so beautiful!”

“”She has a good figure, fair skin, and good facial features. My God, how can she be so beautiful?” ”

“”In the past, I thought Miss Mu was pretty good-looking, but now, it’s just a matter of looking at her!” ”

“This is called no harm without comparison.”

These words drilled into Mu Yourong’s ears.

Mu Yourong frowned slightly.

Were these people blind?

They actually thought ye Zhuo was good-looking!

She was clearly the Phoenix that roamed the nine heavens.

Who Did Ye Zhuo think he was?

“Just then, a petite girl walked over and asked curiously, “Sister Mu, you’re here. By the way, who’s this beauty beside you?” ”

Her name was Xu Jiao.

“She was the daughter of the Xu family, and the Mu and Xu families were on friendly terms, so Mu Yourong had a good relationship with her. ”

“Mu Yourong held Xu Jiao’s hand familiarly and said with a smile, “Jiao Jiao, this is Sister Ye Zao! Don’t you know her?” ”

Ye Zao?

“Xu Jiao was stunned for a moment, then covered her mouth in disbelief. “You mean, Mu Zao?” ”

Mu Yourong nodded with a smile.

“Yes.”

Holy shit!

Xu Jiao looked as if she had been struck by lightning.

Xu Jiao knew ye Zao very well.

“He wore strange clothes every day, and his face was covered with make-up like a ghost. He couldn’t read a few words and called her an idiot, which sullied the word ‘idiot’. ”

“Although the Xu family had a good relationship with the Mu family in the past,. ”

Xu Jiao didn’t like Ye Zao at all.

She didn’t expect ye Zao to become like this all of a sudden.

Xu Jiao wasn’t the only one who was stunned.

Even the others were stunned.

“When ye Zao was still Mu Zao, she was everyone’s entertainment. ”

“”I thought she was the daughter of some family, but it turns out she’s a fake idiot!” ”

“Wasn’t she chased out by the Mu Family? How could she still attend young master Li’s Party?”

“”With just her, of course she doesn’t have the qualifications to attend young master Li’s Party. She must have followed Miss Mu. Miss Mu is also kind-hearted. If it were me, I wouldn’t bring that idiot over!” ”

Everyone’s mocking voices were like knives.

But Ye Zhuo didn’t care at all.

“His handsome face was still as calm as ever, so calm that it was as if the person being mocked was not her. ”

“Mu Yourong curled her lips slightly, a smug look flashing in her eyes. ”

“Just then, a middle-aged man with blonde hair and blue eyes walked over. ”

“F * ck! Toaeon’s Mr. Embert is here too!”

Toaeon’s company had a solid foothold internationally.

“In addition, Toaeon was a producer of high-end luxury goods, and the vice president, Mr. Embert, often appeared in financial newspapers, causing him to become a well-known celebrity. ”

“”As expected, young master Li still has a lot of face. He even invited Embert.” ”

“Mu Yourong puffed out her chest. Others might not be familiar with Embert, but she had indeed met him a few times. ”

“Previously, she had submitted the jewelry design to TOAEON company. ”

“So without thinking, she knew that Mr. Embert must have come to greet her and settle the matter of the design. ”

“At that time, she would be the jewelry designer of TOAEON! ”

“Seeing that Embert was getting closer and closer to her, Mu Yourong mentally prepared herself and took the initiative to extend her hand to Embert. “Hello...” ”

Seeing this.

Everyone revealed surprised expressions. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

They did not expect that Embert was actually here to look for Mu Yourong.

A real daughter was a real daughter.

Who knew how many streets she would have to walk to surpass a fake daughter.

“But at this moment, Embert seemed to have not seen Mu Yourong at all. He directly walked past her and walked in front of ye Zao. “Miss Ye, I didn’t expect to see you here.” ”

“Ye Zao smiled slightly. “Mr. Embert, I also didn’t expect to see you here.” ”

“Beside him, Mu Yourong’s hand froze in mid-air. It was not right to take it back, nor was it right to not take it back. She was extremely embarrassed. ”

She hadn’t expected that Embert had actually come to look for ye Zao.

How did they meet?

Just what was going on?

Mu Yourong’s face was pale.

The others were also stunned!
