Translator: 549690339

“”Grandma Fei, I know you’ve always been biased, but I didn’t expect you to be so biased.”Ye Lan looked at Grandma Fei with a mocking look in her eyes, “For ye Zao, you can actually reverse the truth and insult my parents like this! “Do you really think I don’t know my own background? “Let me tell you, I’ve found out everything! “I’m very likely to be the first-born princess of Manxing Kingdom that was lost in the early years! “Wasn’t Ye Zhuo just jealous of my birth? That’s why he made my parents look so terrible!” ”

How Shameless!

Ye Zhuo was already shameless enough. He didn’t expect this old woman to be so shameless as to actually make up such a lie.

“”What did you say?”Grandma Fei felt that Ye Lan was suffering from paranoia. “The first-born Princess of Manxing Kingdom? Ye Lan, are you daydreaming?” ”

A princess of the Manxing Kingdom like her!

“She really had a brain that was filled with water, but a small brain that raised fish! ”

“I’m Daydreaming? Who is the one who is jealous of me! You hid my birth from others!”Ye Lan looked at Grandma Fei. “Do you really think that everyone else is a fool? That they can be controlled by others!”

“Grandma Fei laughed out loud, “If you really are the lost princess of the Manxing Kingdom, do you think that searing can hide it? “If you really are the princess of the Manxing Kingdom, then why didn’t the Manxing Kingdom send people to bring you back? “Ye Lan, don’t you think that you are dreaming too much? “Even if you are dreaming, you have to dream something reliable!” ”

“”You don’t need to know the reason behind this,”ye LAN continued, “You only need to know that from now on, I will not be deceived by ye burning anymore!” ”

“Seeing ye Lan like this, Grandma Fei was a little speechless and said, “Don’t tell me you really think you’re the Manxing Kingdom’s direct princess?” ”

“Are you panicking?”Ye Lan glanced at Grandma Fei.

“In Ye Lan’s view, Grandma Fei was feeling guilty right now. ”

“Grandma Fei said, “Ye Lan, wake up! You’re not a princess, and you don’t have the life of a princess. Hurry up and wake up. Don’t let others see you as a joke!” ”

“”Who is the one who should wake up?”Ye Lan looked at Grandma Fei, the corners of her mouth curling up slightly, “Grandma Fei, I don’t want to lower myself to your level because you’re already old. After all, you’ve raised me before. You Can Leave Now!” ” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“”Ye Lan! I know that your nature isn’t bad, and you’re not a bad child either! Wake up and rein in your horses at the Precipice! Perhaps burning can still forgive you! Don’t make mistakes again and again!”Grandma Fei had watched Ye Lan grow up, she really did not want to see ye Lan fall into the abyss. ”

“”It’s already so late, and you’re still here acting with me?”Ye Lan said speechlessly, “Don’t think that I don’t know what you’re thinking! Ye searing is already dead, and from now on, Chang Yue will belong to Miss Qiu!” ”

“And she would also smoothly return to her position, reunite with her parents, and inherit the throne in the future! ”

The old thing wanted to lie to her?

Dream On!

Did she think that she was that little girl who didn’t know anything?

“”Ye Lan!”Grandma Fei Sighed. “Listen to me, I really didn’t lie to you, and I didn’t Act! I can swear to the heavens that if I tell a lie, I’ll be struck by lightning!” ”

“Someone!”Ye Lan shouted.

“Chief.”The assistant immediately came in.

“Ye Lan frowned and said, “Please go out, Grandma Fei.” ”

“Yes.”The assistant nodded and made a ‘please’gesture.

“Grandma Fei raised her head and looked at ye Lan, frowning deeply. “Ye Lan, don’t make a wrong step! I have never lied to you, neither has burning!” ”

“Ye Lan’s back was facing Grandma Fei, and she did not say anything. ”

The assistant forcefully invited Grandma Fei out.

“Walking out of the door, Grandma Fei turned to look at Ye Lan. “Ye Lan, you’ll regret it!” ”

Regret?

What did she regret?

“Right now, she only regretted not killing ye Zhuo earlier. ”

“If she had killed ye Zhuo earlier, she would have been able to reunite with her family earlier! ”

It would not have taken so many years.

“”Yes, I do regret it very much.”Ye Lan looked at Grandma Fei. “I regret why I only saw ye Zao’s true face now! If it weren’t for her, I would have been reunited with my family long ago!” ”

“Grandma Fei’s brows were deeply furrowed. In a split second, she lifted her feet and walked forward. ”

“When she walked out of the base, Grandma Fei let out a long sigh. ”

“Ye Lan had become like this. She felt very uncomfortable just looking at her, not to mention ye Zao, her elder sister. ”

Ye Zhuo had done so much for ye Lan.

“In the end, he ended up with the reputation of a villain. ”

“One day, ye Lan would regret it. ”

“But on that day, everything would be too late! ”
