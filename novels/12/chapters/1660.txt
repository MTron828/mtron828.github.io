“”I’ve said before that the eight planets can land at will, but Europa is the only one that can’t go.”Ye Zhuo’s tone was a little faint. ”

“”Why?”Director Ma didn’t understand ye Zhuo very much. “Miss Ye, if Europa is really suitable to live on, then we can completely carry out the plan of moving to Europa!” ”

“Although director Ma had never been to Europa, through his years of research on Europa, he knew that there must be life on Europa! ”

“After all, Europa had an atmosphere, a water source, and an oasis! ”

“After saying that, director ma continued, “Miss Ye, instead of spending all your effort to transform the desolate Mars, you might as well invest all your heart and soul in Europa!” ”

Director Ma really wanted to go to Europa to take a look.

“However, the person who made the decision here was ye Zhuo. ”

“Since ye Zhuo didn’t agree, there was nothing he could do. ”

“Ye Zhuo slightly raised his eyes, but no expression could be seen on his clear and shallow brows. “Europa may seem beautiful, but it is actually full of dangers. Although there are mountains and rivers, it is not suitable for the survival of us humans!” ”

“”You didn’t even take a look, so how would you know that Europa is full of dangers and is not suitable for the survival of humans?”Director ma asked back. ”

“Director Ma had always respected ye Zao. Otherwise, he would not have supported ye Zao from the start of the aircraft carrier project until today! ”

“But now, he was a little angry. ”

He felt that ye Zao was too dictatorial!

She thought that she would not let everyone land in Europe!

“After saying that, director Ma felt that his tone was not quite right, then, he said, “Miss Ye, my words just now might have been a little too harsh! Please don’t be angry. I really want to go to Europe to take a look. Firstly, I don’t want the Chinese people to lose a precious resource just like that! “Secondly, I don’t want to let country C or other countries take advantage of this! “We clearly have a lightspeed aircraft carrier, but we don’t want to land on Europe. This is simply a waste of God’s Gift!” ”

“Other than China, there were many countries that wanted to land on Europe to seize the resources first. ”

“Ye Zhuo tapped the table with his fingers, “Director Ma, I can understand your feelings. “Actually, before this, I had also studied Europa. If there wasn’t concrete evidence that Europa was indeed not suitable for human survival, I wouldn’t have stopped everyone from landing on Europa.” ”

“What evidence?”Director ma asked. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Ye Zhuo reached out and pressed on the mouse. Immediately, data graphs of Europa appeared on the projector. ”

“According to the data graphs, Europa was indeed not suitable for survival. ”

“Seeing this, everyone began to discuss. ”

“”All the tranquility and peace on Europa are fake. Once humans land on Europa, unless they never return to Earth, the consequences will be unimaginable once they return to Earth.”Speaking up to this point.., ye Zhuo clicked on the mouse and retrieved the data graph. “So, director Ma, it’s better for you to quickly withdraw your thoughts.” ”

“Director ma frowned slightly, “Miss Ye, these data maps are all observed by the naked eye. Everything at the moment is just a guess. I think that before landing on Europa, no one should label Europa!” ”

“There was a saying that said, “Practice makes perfect!”! ”

“No matter what, director Ma wanted to go to Europa to take a look. Only by witnessing it with his own eyes could he be at ease! ”

“”I think what director Ma said makes sense,”professor Feng said, “Miss Ye, none of us have ever been to the Europa! Besides, director Ma and I have been studying the Europa for more than ten years. Through observation, the Europa is not as serious as what miss ye said.” ”

“Ye Zhuo had never logged into the Europa. The data that she presented were all her guesses! Professor Yue was the same as director Ma. She had studied Europa for so many years and even dreamed of logging onto Europa to take a look. Previously, there was no way to go, but now that there was a way, she did not want to give up just like that! ”

“What if Europa had an inexhaustible supply of resources? Just because ye Zhuo’s guesses did not log onto Europa and let other countries get there first, the loss would be too great! ”

“Yu Zifei continued, “Professor Feng, director Ma, I can understand your feelings, but since miss ye said that the Europa is in danger, she must have her reasons! “We should trust Miss Ye. If we land in the Europa and bring the danger back to Earth, no one can bear the responsibility!” ”

“Tang mi nodded. “Yes, I also support Miss Ye.” ”
