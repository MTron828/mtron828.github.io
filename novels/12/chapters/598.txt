How did ye Zao appear at the award ceremony?

Could she be Dr. YC?

No.

Impossible.

Ye Zao was definitely not Dr. YC.

She was seeing things.

She must be seeing things.

How Could Ye Zao be Dr. YC?

It couldn’t be!

Feng Xianxian comforted herself in her heart.

“But as the figure got closer and closer to her, Feng Xianxian’s face became paler and paler, and her back broke out in cold sweat. ”

“The person on the red carpet had a slender figure, and his eyes and brows were like paintings. ”

“As he walked, he carried with him an innate aura. ”

The tall mountain stopped.

It was ye Zao.

This was ye Zao.

It really was ye Zao.

Why was ye Zao Here?

What was she doing here?

Feng Xianxian gulped and tried her best to calm herself down.

“Lin Ze, who was beside her, was also stunned. ”

Could it be...

That the Dr. YC he admired the most was his own younger sister?

This seemed a little surreal.

It felt like a dream.

“Looking at the person walking on the red carpet, the Lin family’s relatives below the stage were all dumbfounded. ”

“Is that person little twelve?”

“I think so!”

“Why is little twelve walking on the red carpet for the presenters?”

“Auntie! Auntie is so cool!”Duan Duan Duan clapped excitedly when he saw ye Zhuo.

“Yang Wenyin looked at Wu Mei, her eyes full of shock. “Sister-in-law, little twelve can’t be Dr. YC, right?” ”

Wu Mei didn’t say anything for a long time.

One had to know.

Ye Zhuo was only 19 years old this year.

If she was Dr. YC...

Then how terrifying was her strength?

How many people could be called doctors at the age of 19?

“Moreover, this science and Technology Award was named after Dr. YC! ”

“”Are your heads stuck in the door? How can this Wild Girl Be Dr. YC? Do you think this is selling cabbages on the street? Anyone can be a doctor?”Old Mrs. Lin frowned tightly, she said angrily, “The host asked Dr. YC to go on stage. Why is this wild girl going on stage? She has no manners at all! She has almost embarrassed the Lin Family!” ”

Ye Zao was Dr. YC?

It was a big joke!

How could a person like ye Shu raise a good daughter?

“Fortunately, Lin Ze grew up by her side. ”

She taught Lin ze well by example.

“If Lin Ze had grown up by Ye Shu’s side like ye Zao, he would have been spoiled long ago! ”

Feng Qianhua and old Mrs. Lin had the same thought.

The title of doctor was not so easy to get.

How Old was ye Zao?

He was only nineteen.

“Feng Qianxian was so talented, but she had only gotten third place. ”

Could Ye Zao surpass Feng Qianxian and become a doctor?

In her dreams!

“Feng Qianhua smiled and said, “Aunt Lin, don’t be angry. Maybe Zao was envious when he saw Ah Ze and Xianxian winning the award. He wanted to go up and congratulate Ah Ze and Xianxian, right?” ”

What was the use of being envious if she was not capable?

Her daughter was still a good person!

“Although Feng Xianxian got third place, Feng Qianhua was still very happy. ”

“After all, among the three people who won the award, only Feng Xianxian was a girl. ”

This meant that Feng Qianqian was extremely talented!

“They were both nineteen years old, but ye Zhuo did not even qualify for the competition, while Feng Qianqian was the third winner. ”

Ye Zhuo could not compare to Feng Qianqian at all.

Ye Zhuo could not even compare to one-thousandth of Feng Qianqian.

Her daughter was destined to become a top person.

“In front of so many people, it had to be said that Feng Qianqian gave her a hard time. ”

“Thinking of this, a carefree smile appeared on Feng Qianhua’s face. ”

“Old Madam Lin snorted coldly. “Even if you want to congratulate her, don’t you see the occasion? She’s letting Dr. YC go on stage now! Why is she running around like a clown? If this gets out, people will think that our Lin family has no rules!” ”

A wild girl is indeed a wild girl!

She doesn’t have the ability to see at all!

Why doesn’t she take a look at the occasion!

What a disgrace!

Old Mrs. Lin wanted nothing more than to immediately pull ye Zao down from the stage.

Feng Qianhua had a smile on her face and didn’t say anything.

Old Mrs. Lin was right.

Ye Zao was a clown.

He was extremely ugly. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Old Mrs. Lin turned to look at Lin Jincheng and said in a low voice, “Jincheng! Hurry up and call this wild girl down! If she doesn’t find it embarrassing in front of so many people, our Lin family can’t afford to lose face!” ”

“At this moment, ye Zao walked from the red carpet to the stage. ”

The spotlight fell on his exquisite eyebrows.

It was as bright as the stars.

“”Dr. YC, I’ve heard so much about you!”The host hurried to welcome ye Zao, “Come! Let’s give a round of applause to welcome the Doctor!” ”

“”Hello, host.”Ye Zao nodded slightly. ”
