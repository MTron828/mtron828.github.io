The only wish of the two elders was to see Gu Dening have a good home in their lifetime.

It would be best if they could see the birth of their granddaughter.

“”Fate hasn’t arrived yet. It’s useless to rush me.”GU dening continued, “Tell Mom and dad not to worry. When fate arrives, I’ll naturally bring my boyfriend back.” ”

“Gu Dexin smiled. “You should also be more attentive to your own matters. Don’t think that fate hasn’t arrived yet. Sometimes, you have to take the initiative too.” ”

“Gu dening dealt with Gu Dexin. “I know, I know!” ”

“Seeing her like this, Gu Dexin didn’t say anything more. As long as gu dening knew what she was doing, it was fine. ”

“After all, Gu Dening wasn’t a one-year-old or two-year-old child anymore! ”

...

On the other side.

Cen Jiang was having an online video call with Yu Zifei and the others when he suddenly received a call from ye Zhuo.

Cen Jiang looked at Yu Zifei across the air. “Wait a moment. Miss ye is calling. I need to take a call first.”

Yu Zifei nodded. “Go ahead.”

Cen Jiang went outside. “Miss Ye.”

“Have you sent the things over to Professor Feng?”Ye Zhuo’s voice came from the other end of the phone.

“Cen Jiang said, “I’ve sent them over.” ”

“”Okay.”Ye Zhuo continued, “That’s all for now. If there’s anything, feel free to contact me.” ”

“”Okay, Miss Ye.” ”

“After hanging up the phone, Cen Jiang returned inside and continued with the meeting. ”

“Yu Zifei said, “A while ago, miss ye said that she was going to Yun Jing. has she not returned yet?” ”

“”Not yet.”Cen Jiang adjusted the angle of the camera and continued, “Let’s continue with the topic from before.” ”

“Alright.”

After work.

Professor Feng arrived at the coffee shop at the first possible moment.

Director Ma followed closely behind.

“Not long after Professor Feng arrived, director Ma also arrived. He looked at professor Feng and asked, “Did you get the item?” ”

Professor Feng nodded.

“Director ma continued, “Among the four brothers, Cen Jiang is the most scheming. He didn’t suspect anything, right?” ”

“”No,”professor Feng continued, “Moreover, he was the one who took the initiative to send over the analysis report of the volcanic crystal.” ”

“That’s good.”Director ma heaved a sigh of relief. “I’ve already contacted Jamila. He’ll be here soon.”

“At this moment, footsteps sounded in the air. ”

“Director ma turned around and immediately smiled. “Dr. Jamila, you’re here.” ”

“Jamila smiled and said, “The two of you have indeed lived up to our expectations. Where’s the item?” ”

“”It’s in my mobile phone photo album,”professor Feng continued, “I’m sending it to you now.” ”

“Hurry up and send it.”

“However, at this moment, director Ma gave Professor Feng a look and continued, “Dr. Jamila, we have done what we promised you. I wonder when you will be able to do what you promised us?” ”

“Jamila smiled and said, “Dr. Cara and I are still counting on you two to jointly research the speed of light technology. Please rest assured that we will not go back on our words.” ”

“Then when can we go to country C?”Director ma asked. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“”Anytime,”Jamila answered. ”

“Really?”Director ma asked in surprise.

“Jamila nodded and continued, “All the procedures have been completed. You are now the new people of Country C!” ”

Professor Feng and director Ma looked at each other and saw a bright light in each other’s eyes.

Good!

This was great!

They could finally leave this place.

“Director ma continued, “Then let’s make some preparations. We’ll set off for country C in two days.” ”

“Jamila narrowed her eyes and continued, “Can you send me the analysis report on the Volcanic Crystal Now?” ”

“”Yes.”Director ma nodded. “Professor Feng, quickly send it to him.” ”

Professor Feng took out his phone and sent the analysis report to Jamila.

“When she saw the analysis report, Jamila’s eyes were filled with pride. ”

She had overestimated YC!

“If YC was really that powerful, professor Feng and director Ma would not have been able to get their hands on it so easily. ”

“Jamila continued, “Since the matter has been settled, I will return to my country first. Please settle the matters here and leave immediately.” ”

“Okay.”Director ma nodded.

Professor Feng still had a mother who was still alive.

“If she were to go to country C, she would definitely bring her mother along. ”

“However, after returning home, her old mother was unwilling to go to country C, she pointed at Professor Feng’s nose and scolded, “China nurtured you and made you, but now you have done such a thing! If you want to leave, you can leave! Even if I die, I will die on Chinese soil!” ”

“Professor Feng saw that his old mother was invulnerable, so he had no choice but to pack his things overnight and board the plane to C country. ”

“When she boarded the plane, director Ma had arrived with his family. ”

“When director Ma saw her board the plane alone, he asked, “Professor Feng, Where’s Your Mother?” ”

Professor Feng shook his head. “She’s old. She’s a little stubborn!”

What was wrong with C Nation?

“Then should we leave her alone in the country?”Director ma asked.

“Professor Feng continued, “This is her own choice.” ”

Director ma sighed helplessly. “Then this is the only way now.”

The next morning.

8:30 am.

Ye Zhuo returned to the base on time.

“The gate of the base had just opened when Cen Jiang came over with the information. “Miss Ye, everything is as you expected. Professor Feng has defected and went to C nation overnight.” ”

“Who else?”Ye Zhuo took the documents and asked.

“”Director Ma,”Cen Jiang said. ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Cen Jiang saw that ye Zhuo was so calm and couldn’t help but ask, “Miss Ye, aren’t you surprised at all?” ”

“”Ever since the data was leaked last time, I knew that there must be a traitor within our ranks.”Ye Zhuo continued, “Professor Feng and director Ma’s lifelong wish is to land in Europe.” ”

“Speaking up to this point, ye Zhuo continued, “I only hope that after they land in Europe, they won’t regret it.” ”
