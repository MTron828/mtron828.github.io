Translator: 549690339

“She had never dreamed that Xi Muwen, as the biological father of her child, would actually be so ruthless to the three-year-old little half moon.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

It made her blame herself for thirty-six years and suffer for thirty-six years.

“Thirty-six years later, she finally managed to find Little Half Moon, yet she was almost deceived by Xi Muwen and missed her biological daughter.”

“Thinking about how she had been toyed with by Xi Muwen all her life, Aunt Lang’s face was filled with self-deprecating laughter.”

She was too stupid.

She was used.

“In the end, she was separated from her mother and grandfather Ye died a tragic death.”

Aunt Lang regretted it too much.

She had never regretted it so much in her life.

“If time could be reset, she would definitely not have chosen XI Muwen.”

Unfortunately...

She could not have it all over again.

“Auntie Lang tried her best to calm herself down. She could not let the Xi family see anything wrong yet. After organizing all the information, she wiped the tears off her face and pretended like nothing had happened, she walked out.”

“From now on, she had to be strong!”

“In that instant, Auntie Lang seemed to have changed.”

“In a moment, Auntie Lang returned to Jiang Yan’s room and pretended that nothing had happened. “Yang Jiao, how is Little Half Moon?””

Yang Jiao looked up at Auntie Lang and was stunned.

Why did she feel that this old hag seemed to have changed?

“Yang Jiao narrowed her eyes. When she looked up again, she felt that Auntie Lang was no different from usual.”

Could it be that she had seen wrongly?

“Yang jiao smiled and said, “Sister, don’t worry. She just took her medicine and now she’s asleep again.””

“Hearing that, Aunt Lang heaved a sigh of relief. “That’s good. Yang Jiao, it’s been hard on you! Ever since Little Half Moon came back, you’ve put in a lot of effort!””

“”Sister, why are you still treating me like an outsider!”Yang Jiao held Aunt Lang’s hand and said, “Little Half Moon is your and Mu Wen’s daughter. That’s my daughter! Shouldn’t I treat my own daughter well? You mustn’t treat her like an outsider!””

“If it were in the past, Aunt Lang would definitely be grateful to Yang Jiao. She would think that Yang Jiao was a good person, to actually treat Xiao Banyue as her own child.”

But now.

It wouldn’t be like that.

She could only blame herself for being too stupid. She couldn’t see through Yang Jiao’s disguise before.

But now...

Yang Jiao’s face was full of flaws.

“She clearly hated her to the core, yet she still pretended to smile at her and call her sister.”

Disgusting!

It was absolutely disgusting!

“Actually, Yang Jiao and Xi Muwen did this for two reasons.”

One was to let Xi Weiyue become grandfather Ye’s successor and smoothly join the Shunxi Corporation.

“Secondly, she still had a gold mine map in her hands.”

“As long as she successfully obtained these two things, Xi Empire’s position in the capital city would undergo an earth-shattering change.”

It was her fault that she had not noticed these things before.

“The more Aunt Lang thought about it, the more uncomfortable she felt. She wished she could just kill Yang Jiao to vent her anger. To cover up her anger, she held Yang Jiao’s hand, with red eyes, she said, “Yang Jiao, you’ve treated Xiao Banyue better than I’ve treated her. I don’t even know how to thank you! Thankfully, when my father left, he left me with something...””

Yang Jiao’s eyes lit up when she heard that.

Something?

Could it be that the thing this old hag was talking about was the gold mine map.

At least this old hag had a conscience and knew to give the gold mine map to her.

Aunt Lang could see the change in Yang Jiao’s expression.

It seemed like her guess was right.

Xi Muwen and Yang Jiao were here for the gold mine map and the Shunxi Financial Group.

“Currently, Xi Weiyue had successfully joined the Shunxi Financial Group. The reason they left her in the Xi family was to get their hands on the gold mine map!”

“Then, Aunt Lang’s tone changed, she continued, “But I know that you two aren’t the kind of people who covet wealth and glory. Some things are just white and yellow to you, but other than that, I really have nothing else to give you.””

“Yang Jiao immediately held Aunt Lang’s hand. “Sister, look at what you’re saying! As long as it’s something you give, how can we, husband and wife, dislike it!””

Aunt Lang nodded. “As long as you don’t dislike it.”

“”I don’t dislike it, I definitely won’t dislike it.”Yang Jiao hurriedly nodded, afraid that Aunt Lang would regret it in the next second.”

“Aunt Lang narrowed her eyes and turned to look at Yang Jiao who was lying on the bed. She continued, “Didn’t you say that you’ve already taken the fever medicine for less than half a month? Then why is her face still so red?””

“Yang jiao smiled and said, “The effect of the fever medicine is not that fast! Just Wait a little longer and the fever will go down!””
