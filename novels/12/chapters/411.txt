“Shen Rong’s voice was full of tears as Blood and tears flowed down her face one after another. She slowly approached mu yourong, “But I’m your biological mother! Biological mother! How could you lay your hands on me! Do you still have a conscience? !” ”

“Mu Yourong propped her hands on the ground and retreated backwards, her back drenched in cold sweat. “Mother, please forgive me... Forgive me... I’m your and father’s only daughter...” ”

She had thought that Shen Rong would never know what she had done until she died.

Unfortunately.

A man’s plan was not as good as God’s.

Shen Rong still knew.

“Pay with your life! Vile daughter! I will make you pay with your life!”

“Mu Yourong was so scared that she kowtowed, her forehead hitting the floor with a loud thud. Not long after, her forehead was covered in blood, “Mother, I know I was wrong! I really know I was wrong! Please forgive me this time, okay? In the future, on the anniversary of your death, I will burn a lot of money for you! In any case, you are already dead, so please let me live! Don’t worry, I will think of a way to get my father out as soon as possible. Please forgive me, Okay?” ”

PA —

“At this moment, all the lights in the room were lit up. ”

Mu Yourong was stunned and raised her head to look forward.

“She saw Shen Rong standing in front of her, extending her hand slowly towards her face. ”

Mu Yourong’s eyes were wide open. She could only watch helplessly as Shen Rong peeled off her face. Mu Yourong had originally thought that there was definitely a bloody face hidden under this face.

“She had never thought that this face was as clear as a painting, so beautiful that it could not be described with words. ”

It was not Shen Rong!

This was?

Ye Zao!

Mu Yourong reacted at this moment.

Fake!

All of this was fake!

It was ye Zao who wanted to harm her!

Slut.

“Ye Zao, this slut! ”

“”Ye Zao, it’s You!”Mu Yourong stood up from the ground and glared fiercely at ye Zao. ” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“”It’s me.”Ye Zao curled his lips slightly. “Mu Yourong, I really didn’t expect that you would be able to do something like killing your mother.” ”

“Although he had already guessed the process, when he learned of the final outcome, Ye Zao was still stunned. ”

Shen Rong treated Mu Yourong very well.

She had not expected that Mu Yourong would actually make a move on Shen Rong.

“What are you talking about?”A hint of panic flashed in Mu Yourong’s eyes. “I don’t understand!”

She could not admit it!

She absolutely could not admit it!

“If she admitted it, she would be finished. ”

“Mu Yourong tried her best to suppress the fear in her heart. She pointed at the door and said, “This is my home. Get lost! Get Lost Right Now!” ”

Ye Zhuo pointed at Shen Rong’s posthumous photo. “Look over there.”

Mu Yourong raised her head to look.

“Beside the frame of Shen Rong’s posthumous photo, there was a red flash. ”

That Was...

A pinhole camera!

This B * Tch ye Zao had actually installed a needle-eye camera in her house!

Mu Yourong took a few steps back weakly. The fear that she had managed to suppress with great difficulty surged into her heart again. “Ye Zao! What on Earth do you want? !”

“Mu Yourong looked at ye Zao with Bloodshot Eyes. That look of hers had already lost control. “B * Tch! It’s all because of you, B * Tch! It’s all because of you! Go To Hell!” ”

Ye Zao!

It was all because of ye Zao!

“If it wasn’t for ye Zao, she wouldn’t have come to this point. ”

“It was ye Zao who had taken her life away, and it was also ye Zao who had personally destroyed everything in the Mu family. ”

“Even if she had to die, she would drag ye Zao along with her to die! ”

“In any case, her hands had already been stained with a human life! ”

She had to bury ye Zao along with her!

Mu Yourong casually picked up the fruit knife on the coffee table and rushed towards ye Zao.

“Bang!”

“At this moment, a tall and straight figure rushed over from outside the door. His clothes fluttered in the wind as he kicked away the fruit knife in Mu Yourong’s hand. ”

Bang

The fruit knife fell to the ground with a crisp sound.

“At the same time, Mu Yourong was also kicked onto the sofa. ”

It was no one else.

It was Cen Shaoqing!

“Are You Alright?”Cen Shaoqing tilted his head to look at Ye Zhuo.

“”I’m fine.”Ye Zhuo continued, “Oh right, where’s your good brother?” ”

Cen Shaoqing turned to look at the door.

“He saw Li Qiandong standing by the door. His face was deathly pale, as if he had lost his soul. ”

Mu Yourong also turned to look at the door.

With this look.

She was completely flustered.

Li Qiandong!

That was Li Qiandong!

Why was Li Qiandong standing there?

When did Li Qiandong come?

Li Qiandong was the only person she could rely on.

No!

She couldn’t Lose Li Qiandong!

She couldn’t!

“Mu Yourong couldn’t care about anything else. She scrambled to Li Qiandong’s side and hugged him, with a trembling voice, she said, “Big Brother Li, listen to my explanation. It’s not like this. It was that B * Tch Ye Zhuo who harmed me! It was her! It was all her...” ”
