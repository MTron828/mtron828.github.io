Translator: 549690339

How would she be able to establish herself in cloud capital in the future?

Cen Shaoqing stood not far away. His line of sight passed through the crowd and locked onto the two lines of words. His eyes narrowed slightly. “Concealing one’s skills is better than using obscure and clear words; concealing one’s skills is better than using obscure and clear words.”

The meaning of these two sentences was: one would rather pretend to be clumsy than appear too smart. One would rather restrain one’s skills and not reveal one’s sharp edge. One would rather be easygoing and not be too conceited and aloof. One would rather retreat and not advance too aggressively.

“After a moment, CEN Shaoqing chuckled. ”

These two sentences.

Weren’t they referring to Ye Zhuo himself?

It turned out that she had been hiding her clumsiness all these years.

“”Master, you’re Too Amazing!”Li Qiandong walked up to ye Zhuo and praised him from the bottom of his heart. ”

“Ye Zhuo’s tone was shallow. “I haven’t practiced calligraphy for a long time, and I’m a Little Rusty.” ”

This sentence was not boasting.

“In Ye Zao’s world, even the big shots in the calligraphy world had to call her “Great aunt”when they saw her! ”

This was the first time she had used a brush since she came here. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Ye Zao’s casual sentence shocked Li Qiandong.

Even someone who was rusty could write so well.

“If she were to write seriously, wouldn’t those masters in the calligraphy world have to retire? ”

“”Great God, you’re too modest.”Li Qiandong continued, “By the way, the desserts made by master Michelin tonight are still to your liking, right?” ”

Ye Zao nodded. “The taste is very good.”

Hearing this.

Mu Yourong’s expression became even uglier.

What did Li Qiandong just call ye Zao?

Great God?

How could ye Zao be a match for her?

“Li Qiandong clearly saw her as his confidante, so how could he please ye Zao? ”

Shameless!

Ye Zao was simply Shameless.

Mu Yourong suddenly thought of last year’s wonderful sound’s third anniversary party.

At that time.

“Ye Zao was just like today, snatching away the halo that originally belonged to her. ”

A silent fear spread throughout Mu Yourong’s entire body.

“At this moment, a man in a suit and tie walked forward and said, “My father likes calligraphy very much, so I want to buy these two sets of characters back for my father to copy. I wonder if Miss Ye will sell these two sets of characters?” ”

As soon as these words were said.

Everyone at the side looked at Ye Zhuo in disbelief.

This was because the person who had come was not some ordinary noble.

“Instead, it was the most ancient family in the capital, the Bai family. ”

“This person was the eldest son of the Bai family, Bai Huaijin. At such a young age, he had already accomplished something in the officialdom. ”

The combination of officialdom and commerce had caused the Bai family’s status in the capital to soar and leap to the top of the wealthy families in the capital.

No one had expected that Bai huaijin would actually take a fancy to ye Zhuo’s work!

“As the saying went, it was easy to get things done in court. ”

“Many people wanted to make use of tonight’s banquet to befriend Bai Huaijin, but unfortunately, they had never found the opportunity. ”

“Who would have thought that in the end, it would benefit ye Zhuo. ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled faintly. “The beauty of a gentleman coming of age is just two characters. If you like it, sir, I’ll give it to you.” ”

“”Thank you for your generous gift, Miss Ye. My surname is Bai, and this is my business card. If there’s anything I can help you with in the future, Miss Ye, you can contact me at any time! I’ll definitely do my best!” Bai Huaijin handed over the business card with both hands. ”

“Then I won’t stand on ceremony with Mr. Bai.”Ye Zao took the business card.

“Seeing this, Mu Yourong felt even more uncomfortable. She just looked at ye Zao like he was about to eat her up. ”

“Her hands were tightly clenched into fists. Because she had used too much strength, her nails were deeply embedded in her skin, and she was completely unaware of it. ”

“If ye Zao had not been there, then she would be the one giving Bai huaijin the words. ”

She would also be the one being praised by everyone!

It was ye Zao who had stolen everything from her.

No!

She definitely could not let this little slut ye Zao climb onto her head!

She was the real Phoenix!

What was ye Zao to her?

She was only fit to be her stepping stone.

“Seeing that Mu Yourong’s expression was not right, Li Qiandong asked with concern, “Yourong, are you alright?” ”

“I’m fine.”Mu Yourong tried her best to put on a smile and pretended as if nothing had happened.

“Li Qiandong continued, “If you’re not feeling well, you can go to my lounge to rest.” ”

“”Thank you, brother Li. I’m really fine.” ”

“After rolling up the words and sending them to Bai huaijin, ye Zao returned to the buffet table and continued eating dessert. ”

She was very satisfied with her food.

“As soon as a piece of dessert entered her mouth, she narrowed her eyes slightly. Her pair of exquisite Phoenix eyes narrowed into a beautiful crescent shape. ”

“This scene fell into the eyes of Cen Shaoqing, who was not far away. ”

His fingers that were twirling the Buddha beads paused for a moment and almost subconsciously walked over.

“Nice handwriting.”A deep and magnetic voice suddenly came to his ear.
