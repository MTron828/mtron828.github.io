“At this point, Granny Fei continued, “The two of you are doing well. In the future, I will bless you in heaven and give birth to a fat boy as soon as possible.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing took a step back and bowed to Granny Fei very seriously. “Thank you, Granny Fei.” ”

“Granny fei smiled and said, “It’s getting late. You should leave quickly.” ”

“”Grandma Fei, we’ll leave first,”ye Zao said. ”

“Let’s go.”Grandma Fei nodded.

The two boarded the aircraft.

“Grandma Fei watched as the aircraft left. After a moment, she retracted her gaze and said with a smile, “Zao Zao, this child has finally found his home.” ”

“Although they didn’t talk much about Cen Shaoqing’s background, Grandma Fei could tell that Cen Shaoqing was born extraordinary. ”

On the other side.

“The aircraft had just landed in front of the door of Siyu Pavilion when Ye Han went up to welcome it. He said in surprise, “Sis! Sis!” ”

“What’s Wrong?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“Ye Han continued, “The tracker tracked the address of the Chief Alliance Master!” ”

“Where is it?”Ye Zhuo asked.

Ye Han immediately took out an electronic map. “It’s right here.”

“Northwest State?”Ye Zhuo frowned slightly.

“Seeing her like this, Cen Shaoqing continued to ask, “Is there anything wrong here?” ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Other than the Eternal Glacier, northwestern region is the extremely cold land of the General Alliance. The most ancient forbidden clan lives there.” ”

“Ye Zhuo had originally suspected that Cen Haifeng had forgotten everything because he was under a forbidden spell. Now that Cen Haifeng had gone to Northwestern region alone, it further confirmed ye Zhuo’s conjecture. ”

Perhaps.

Cen Haifeng had been deceived all these years.

...

On the other side.

At the headquarters.

Duanmu Huangfei had hosted a grand banquet to entertain the first elder and Grand Elder.

The sudden gesture of goodwill left the first elder and the imperial preceptor somewhat dumbfounded.

“The first elder looked at duanmu huangfei and said, “Madam, if there’s anything you want to say, just say it. There’s no need to beat around the bush.” ”

“The national master nodded and said, “You are the mother of our main alliance. As long as it’s under your command, we will do our best.” ”

Duanmu Huang Fei looked at the Great Elder and the National Master and stood up. “I won’t hide it from you two. I do have something to discuss with you two.” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Seeing Duanmu Huang Fei stand up, the Great Elder and the National Master immediately stood up as well. “Madam, you can say it.” ”

Duanmu Huang Fei did not beat around the bush and went straight to the point. “The main alliance has gone to the northwestern region.”

The northwestern region?

Why would he go there all of a sudden?

The Great Elder and the National Master looked at each other and saw doubt in each other’s eyes.

“Duanmu Huang Fei continued, “He’s going to undo the forbidden spell.” ”

“At this point, Duanmu Huang Fei knelt down on one knee. “I beg the two of you to think of a way to prevent this from happening! Otherwise, the consequences will be unimaginable!” ”

“No matter what, CEN Haifeng could not know the truth of the matter. ”

No!

“Seeing this, the great elder and the national master immediately stepped forward and helped Duanmu Huangfei up, “Madam, you are really killing us! “It is our responsibility and obligation to serve you and the General Alliance! “Don’t worry, we will go back and greet the forbidden spell families. No one is allowed to lift the forbidden spell of the General Alliance without our orders.” ”

“”I’m relieved to hear that from you two.”Duanmu huangfei heaved a sigh of relief, he continued, “Also, due to my momentary benevolence, the General Alliance remembered some of the things that happened on Earth. I told him that those people on Earth were the widows left behind by his national anthem. Can you two think of a way to make him forget this memory?” ”

“Duanmu Huangfei was very regretful now. If she didn’t have the heart to watch Cen Haifeng suffer from a headache and help alleviate his headache, Cen Haifeng wouldn’t have remembered anything. ”

Unfortunately.

There was everything in this world except for the medicine of regret.

“Hearing this, the great elder narrowed his eyes and continued, “Sure. When Sir Returns, we will activate the forbidden spell and seal his memory again.” ”

“”Then I’ll have to trouble the two of you,”Duanmu Huang Fei said. ”

“”Of course. Madam, you’re too polite,”the great elder said. ”

“After Duanmu Huang Fei returned, the Great Elder and the National Master immediately issued a notice to the northwest province, forbidding them from releasing Cen Haifeng’s forbidden technique. ”

“As long as the forbidden technique family didn’t release Cen Haifeng’s forbidden technique, Cen Haifeng wouldn’t be able to recover his memories. ”

“As for the Northwest Province’s forbidden family, they only listened to the great elder and the National Master, so there was no need to worry about this matter. ”

“Soon, the Northwest Province replied that Cen Haifeng had arrived, and they had almost released the seal. Fortunately, the great elder and the National Master had notified them in time. ”

“After receiving the Northwest Province’s reply, the Great Elder immediately went to the headquarters with the documents. ”

“Seeing the reply from the northwestern region, Duanmu Huang Fei heaved a sigh of relief. “Sorry to trouble the two of you!” ”

“”This is what we should do,”the national master continued, “Madam, if we encounter any problems in the future, I hope that you can discuss it with us in time. If we are a little late this time, the consequences will be unimaginable.” ”

“Alright.”Duanmu Huang Fei nodded.

On the other side.

“After ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing were ready, they set off for the northwest state. ”

The Northwest State was located in an extremely cold area. They needed to wear thermal down jackets with nanotechnology in order to withstand the severe cold.

“After the aircraft flew for two hours, ye Zhuo suddenly found a person in the snow. “Does that look like an uncle to you?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing looked down and saw a figure lying in the snow, almost melting into the snow. “Let’s go and take a look.” ”
