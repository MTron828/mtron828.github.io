“Chapter 1503: 318: People don’t say much, but your grandmother is still your grandmother! 6”

Translator: 549690339

“So?”Ye Zhuo said.

“Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads. “So, I naturally learned the ability to say less and do more.” ”

“”Do what housework?”Ye Zhuo waved his hand. “There’s no need for that. With Xiao Bai around, it’s not your turn to do housework.” ”

“The corners of Cen Shaoqing’s mouth curled slightly, but he didn’t say anything. ”

“Not housework? Then what is it?”Ye Zhuo looked at Cen Shaoqing curiously.

“Cen Shaoqing lowered his head and lightly pecked her red lips. Then, he lowered his voice and whispered into her ear, “Miss Ye, since you’re so curious, I don’t mind taking you to experience married life in advance.” ”

“His voice was low and husky, full of magnetism. It drilled straight into her ear, making her flustered. ”

“Ye Zhuo was stunned for a moment, then he pushed Cen Shaoqing away. “Only a ghost would want to experience it in advance!” ”

“Cen Shaoqing looked at the figure in front of him and chuckled. He then chased after her. “Leader, Wait for me!” ”

“Ye Zhuo ran quickly. At the end, he even picked up the snow and threw it at Cen Shaoqing. The two of them were in a mess in the snow. It was not until an hour later that the two of them appeared in the hot pot restaurant. ”

“After eating the hot pot, Cen Shaoqing sent ye Zhuo to the Lin family manor. It was almost four o’clock in the morning. ”

Ye Zhuo gently pushed the door open and used her phone to turn on the lights in the living room.

“When she turned on the lights, she saw Lin Jincheng stand up from the sofa. “Zhuo Zhuo is back!” ”

“Ye Zhuo did not expect Lin Jincheng to wait for her in the living room. “Dad, why are you still awake?” ”

“”I couldn’t sleep, and I was fine, so I came to the living room to have a seat.”Lin Jincheng had wanted to pick her up at the airport, but Cen Shaoqing had gone, so he did not go. ”

“Ye Zhuo put his suitcase aside. “If I knew you were waiting for me at home, I wouldn’t have gone to eat hotpot with Cen Shaoqing. I made you wait for so long.” ”

“”This child, how can I Not Eat! I’m not waiting for you, I Just Can’t sleep. Come out and have a seat! It’s getting late, you should wash up and go to bed. I’m going back to my room.” ”

“”Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly. Looking at Lin Jincheng’s back, he felt a little sour. ”

Fatherly Love was silent.

“In the past, she never knew that this was how it felt to have a father. ”

“When he went upstairs, ye Zao finally remembered and sent a wechat message to Song Shiyu. [ brother song, I’m already home. ] ”

“Song Shiyu had been looking at his phone for a few hours. When he saw the message from ye Zao, he immediately picked up his phone and wanted to reply, but he held back. ”

He absolutely could not let ye Zao discover anything.

He did not want to quarrel with ye Zao so much that they could not even be friends.

“About ten minutes later, song Shiyu turned on his phone and sent an ‘Ok’emoji over. ”

“On the other side, after ye Zao sent song Shiyu a message, he washed up and went to sleep. Because he slept too late, Ye Zao only got up at ten in the morning. ”

“Seeing her come down, ye Shu smiled and said, “Zhuo Zhuo, hurry up and eat. After eating, we’ll go to your fourth uncle’s house.” ”

“”Go to fourth uncle’s house?”Ye Zhuo asked curiously, “Is there something?” ”

“”Today is Lizi’s birthday, and it’s about to be the new year. Let’s get together before the New Year!” ”

“Ye Zhuo patted his head. “If you didn’t say it, I would have forgotten that today is Lizi’s birthday! Give me three minutes, I’ll eat right away!” ”

“”No Rush, three minutes isn’t enough!” ”

On the other side.

Lin Qingxuan’s villa.

Today was an Lizi’s birthday.

“Early in the morning, Lin Qingxuan and Xia Xiaoman were busy decorating the villa. ”

Sun Jiayi looked at the back view of the couple who were busying themselves for an Lizi and was extremely jealous.

Who was an Lizi?

She was just a stepdaughter!

“A stepdaughter celebrating her birthday, how could she have the right to make such a big fuss? ”

It was a waste of money. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Just wait!

“Sooner or later, she would chase the mother and daughter out of the Lin family. ”

“”Jiayi, what are you doing!”Auntie Sun walked over from behind and said in a low voice, “There are a lot of people today. You have to be careful. Don’t let others see any clues!” ”

“Got it.”Sun Jiayi suppressed the unwillingness in her heart and nodded.

“”Sister-in-law Sun.”At this moment, an Lizi’s voice came from the air. ”

“”Miss, why are you looking for me?”Sister-in-law sun turned around and looked at an Lizi with a smile on her face. ”

“An Lizi continued, “Sister-in-law Sun, have you seen my red sweater? It’s the one with the crocheted buttons.” ”

Sister-in-law Sun Thought for a moment. “It seems to be in the drying room. I’ll go get it for you.”

“Okay.”An Lizi nodded. “You go ahead.”

Auntie Sun turned around to get the clothes.

“An Lizi turned to look at Sun Jiayi. “Sister Jiayi, I’ll have to trouble you to go to the kitchen and ask them to prepare more desserts.” ”

“”Yes, miss.” ”

“Sun Jiayi carried the clothes with a submissive look, but in her heart, she was extremely unwilling. ”

“She was 23 years old this year, while an Lizi was only 20 years old. ”

“They were both born ordinary, so what right did an Lizi have to order her around? ”

Just because an Lizi had a good stepfather?

Just wait!

“Sooner or later, she would become the mistress of this family. ”

Sun Jiayi walked to the kitchen while cursing an Lizi in his heart.

“When he came to the kitchen, Sun Jiayi smiled again. “Uncle Feng, Uncle Li, you two have worked hard! Miss asked you to prepare more desserts.” ”

“”Okay, we understand.”The two desserts nodded. ”

Sun Jiayi turned around and left.

“As soon as she left, the two desserts whispered, “Auntie Sun’s daughter is really sensible. Her mouth is also sweet!” ”

“Master Li nodded in agreement. “Yes! I think this little girl is pretty good. By the way, Old Li, didn’t your son not get married yet? Why Don’t you ask the butler to talk in front of Auntie Sun?” ”

“Master Feng said, “Actually, I think so too!” ”

His son had also graduated from a key university and was now a graduate student. He wasn’t ugly and had a decent job. It shouldn’t be a problem for him to talk about it.

“When she heard this, Sun Jiayi’s face turned green. ”

This Feng Youdao was really interesting!

A pastry chef actually missed her!

“Although she sounded like a dessert master, she was actually working for someone else. She was a completely inferior person. ”

“A toad wanting to eat swan meat, whimsical! ”

Shameless.

“After she became the mistress of this family, the first thing she would do was to fire these two dessert masters who didn’t know their place. ”

“Sun Jiayi came all the way to the lounge. On the way, she happened to see Auntie Sun carrying medicine to the kitchen. ”

“Sun Jiayi quickly caught up with Auntie Sun’s back and said in a low voice, “Mom, did you add anything to this?” ”

“No.”Auntie Sun shook her head and looked around.

“Sun Jiayi said, “How can I not add anything! What if that old woman is pregnant?” ”

“”There are too many people today. What if someone finds out? I heard that the authentic miss of the Lin family, Ye Zhuo, is a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner! These medicines were prescribed by her.”Auntie Sun was a very cautious person. ”

“Sun Jiayi said disdainfully, “She is a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner, not a deity! Can she still smell out what’s in these medicines?” ”
