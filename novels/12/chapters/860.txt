Translator: 549690339

The system was stunned. “Borrow a tractor?”

Not only was the system stunned.

Even the camera crew was stunned.

No one had expected ye Zao to ask to borrow a tractor.

Why would ye Zao Want to borrow a tractor?

“Ye Zao smiled slightly. “Yes, I want to borrow your tractor.” ”

“The system nodded and continued, “Sure, why do you need a tractor? I’ll drive it for you.” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “You don’t have to drive it. I can drive it myself.” ”

“This time, the system was stunned. ”

“”Young Lady, you can drive a tractor?” ”

“When the camera crew behind heard this, they were also shocked beyond words. ”

“In this era, it was very common for women to be able to drive cars, and it was also very common for women to be able to drive yachts... ”

“However, there were almost no women who could drive a tractor. ”

Was Ye Zhuo joking?

“Ye Zhuo nodded. “Yes, I can drive.” ”

“The uncle looked at ye Zhuo and said, “Little girl, come with me.” ”

Ye Zhuo followed the uncle into the courtyard.

There was a blue hand-guided tractor parked in the courtyard.

At the Melon Field.

Yin Wei and the others were putting the watermelon into the basket and preparing to pick it back up.

“At this moment, a rumbling sound came from afar. ”

Yin Wei looked up and saw a red hand-guided tractor driving in their direction.

“Looking from afar, she felt that the person driving the tractor looked familiar. ”

Could it be that she was seeing things?

Yin Wei narrowed her eyes.

“As the tractor got closer, the person driving the tractor also saw more clearly. ”

The girl driving the tractor had long hair that fluttered in the wind.

Her facial features were as beautiful as jade.

She looked valiant and valiant.

This.

This was ye Zao?

“After confirming that the person driving the tractor was really ye Zao, Yin Wei was immediately stunned. ”

She swallowed her throat in disbelief.

“F * CK, F * ck! ”

She was a tough woman!

“Seeing that Yin Wei was stunned, Chang Yu asked curiously, “Wei Wei, what are you looking at?” ”

“Yin Wei turned to look at Chang Yu and pointed in the direction of ye Zao. “Look, is that person driving the tractor ye Zi?” ”

“Chang Yu looked up and could not help but exclaim in surprise, “F * ck! So Fierce?” ”

Wei Xingzhi also looked up.

His eyes were filled with shock!

No one had expected that ye Zao would actually drive the tractor over.

This was too intrepid!

“Not to mention the few people from the red team, even the director team was shocked by Ye Zao. ”

A female broadcaster who could drive a tractor!

She was also so beautiful.

This was simply a treasure trove!

The director immediately got the cameraman to give ye Zao a panoramic close-up.

“There were no flaws on ye Zao’s face. No matter which angle he shot it from, it was very photogenic. ”

Rumble!

The blue tractor approached from afar and soon stopped in front of the few people.

“Ye Zao turned off the engine and jumped down from the tractor. It was a simple action, but it somehow gave people a sense of gangsterism. ”

“”Teacher Wei, let’s use the tractor to pull the watermelon back.” ” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

So Ye Zao didn’t go back to rest just now...

She went to find the tractor to pull the watermelon.

It had to be said that ye Zao refreshed everyone’s understanding of her.

“Wei Xingzhi was still unable to react. He gulped and said, “Ye, you know how to drive a tractor?” ”

“”En, that’s easy. I’ll be able to do it after taking a look.”Ye Zao said casually. ”

“Yin Wei looked at Ye Zao. Her eyes were almost sparkling. “Ye, you’re really amazing!” ”

“”It’s just so-so.”Ye Zao continued, “Let’s start moving the watermelon onto the tractor now. Then, we’ll bring it back in one car. There’s no need to go through so much trouble.” ”

“Behind the hand-guided tractor, there was a huge trailer that could hold almost a ton of things. ”

“”Good! Ye, you have a way!” ”

The few of them began to load the watermelons onto the truck.

Ye Zhuo held a large watermelon in each hand with a calm expression. It was as if the watermelon did not have any weight at all.

“Wei Xingzhi and Chang Yu were originally going to take one watermelon at a time, but when they saw ye Zhuo take two at a time, they immediately took two as well. ”

The two men couldn’t be weaker than a little girl.

“The watermelon was very heavy. When they carried half of it to the car, the two men were extremely tired. ”

Then they looked at ye Zao.

He didn’t even take a deep breath.

He didn’t even say that he was tired.

This was completely different from what Wei Xingzhi and Chang Yu had imagined.

They had thought that ye Zao would hold them back.

“They didn’t expect that in the end, they would be the ones holding them back. ”

“Wei Xingzhi could not care less about being dirty. He sat on the ground and looked at ye Zao. “Yezi, aren’t you tired? Do you want to rest for a while?” ”

Ye Zao looked back slightly. “I’ll carry a few more.”

“Yin Wei was also extremely tired. She sat on the ground and said, “Yezi is really amazing! I see that she’s working as if she’s playing.” ”

Chang Yu nodded. “She’s really amazing. This is the first time I’ve seen a girl like her.”

“After resting for a few minutes, they continued to move the watermelon. ”

Ah!

Yin Wei suddenly let out a scream.

“”What’s Wrong?”Chang Yu, who was the closest to her, immediately ran over. ”

“Yin Wei’s face turned pale. She pointed at the ground and said, “Snake! There’s a snake!” ”

“They saw a long snake on the ground, spitting its tongue at them. ”

“Chang Yu was so scared that he hurriedly took a few steps back. He grabbed Yin Wei’s hand and cried out, “Ah!” ”

“At this moment, a figure ran over quickly. Then, a slender white hand pinched the snake’s seven inches and grabbed it, “Don’t be afraid. This kind of snake is called a cauliflower snake. It’s not poisonous, and it won’t take the initiative to attack people!” ”

“The voice was very light, but it was inexplicably magical, making people unconsciously calm down. ”

Yin Wei and Chang Yu looked at Ye Zao.

They were all stunned.

“If they hadn’t seen it with their own eyes, who would believe that a little girl would dare to catch a snake with her bare hands? ”

“But not only did ye Zao grab the snake like that, there wasn’t a trace of emotion on his picturesque face. ”

He was extremely calm.

This scene was even more exciting than ye Zao driving a tractor.

“Not to mention a little girl, even Chang Yu and Wei Xingzhi, two big men, didn’t dare to do this. ”

The entire program team was shocked by Ye Zao.

Especially the director. He quickly drank a mouthful of mineral water to calm himself down. The excitement in his eyes could not be suppressed.

He could already imagine how explosive the viewership ratings would be after this episode was broadcast

“Yin Wei looked at ye Zao and only reacted after a long time. She tried to control the fear in her heart and continued, “Ye, how did you catch it? Aren’t you afraid?” ”

“I’m not afraid. It Can’t bite me.”Ye Zao’s tone was indifferent as he took a step forward.

“Seeing ye Zao Walk Forward, Yin Wei and Chang Yu immediately took a few steps back. “Ye, don’t walk forward. We’re afraid of snakes!” ”

“Ye Zao stopped and smiled. “A cauliflower snake isn’t poisonous. Moreover, I’ve already pinched its seven inches. Don’t worry, it can’t bite people.” ”

“This snake isn’t poisonous?”Chang Yu’s voice was trembling.

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “It’s not poisonous.”

Chang Yu couldn’t believe it.

All snakes were poisonous in their eyes.

“Yin Wei looked at Ye Zhuo and asked curiously, “Ye, where’s the seven inches of the snake?” ”

“Ye Zhuo held the snake with one hand and pointed at the seven inches of the snake with the other. “It’s right here. As long as you attack quickly and accurately, you can subdue the snake.” ”

“Afraid that Yin Wei could not see where the seven inches of the snake was, ye Zao took a few more steps forward. ”

“”Don’t come over! Ye, don’t come over!”Yin Wei was so scared that her face turned pale. “I’m Scared!” ”

Yin Wei was really scared. Even her voice was distorted.

“Ye Zao stopped in his tracks. “Don’t be scared, Wei Wei. Actually, the cauliflower snake is very docile. Why Don’t you come over and pet it? Just like this. You See, it doesn’t bite, right?” ”

“Yin Wei looked at Ye Zao, who was stroking the cauliflower snake’s head like he was stroking a puppy. Goosebumps appeared on her skin. Not only was she not afraid, she was even more afraid. ”

The others also looked at ye Zao in horror.

“After a moment, Yin Wei gave ye Zao a thumbs up and said, “Ye, you’re really amazing!” ”
