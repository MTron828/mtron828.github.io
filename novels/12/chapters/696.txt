Translator: 549690339

Lin Qingxuan had already discussed with Xia Xiaoman about giving birth.

Both of them decided to let nature take its course.

“It would be best if both of them could have a child after marriage. If they couldn’t have a child, they wouldn’t force it. Anyway, Xia Xiaoman already had an Lizi. ”

An Lizi was so sensible. Lin Qingxuan would treat an Lizi as his own.

Old Lady Lin looked at Lin Qingxuan with disbelief in her eyes.

Never in her wildest dreams did she expect that this most honest and obedient son would one day contradict her for a woman.

She also didn’t expect that Lin Qingxuan would still be brooding over Zhao shuning’s matter.

“Although she was also at fault for Zhao Shuning’s matter, her motive was for Lin Qingxuan’s good. ”

Why couldn’t Lin Qingxuan understand her?

“The More Old Lady Lin thought about it, the sadder she became. She covered her mouth and started coughing violently. ”

She originally wanted to use her body to win Lin Qingxuan’s concern and let Lin Qingxuan know how difficult it had been for her all these years.

“Unfortunately, Lin Qingxuan only glanced at Old Lady Lin and said in a faint tone, “Mom, I will never be separated from Xiao Man anyway. Think about it yourself. I’ll go out first.” ”

“After saying that, Lin Qingxuan turned around and walked out of the door. ”

Old Madam Lin staggered a few steps back and finally sat on the sofa. She didn’t come back to her senses for a long time and her eyes were slightly red.

“She was coughing so badly, but not only did Lin Qingxuan not show any concern, he even stabbed a knife into her heart... ”

“At this moment, Auntie Wang walked out from the side. “Old Madam, don’t be too angry. Maybe Qingxuan was just angry for a moment. When he comes to his senses, he will naturally know that you are doing this for his own good.” ”

“Old Madam Lin Sighed. “I know this child’s character very well. This child either doesn’t say anything, or he is a man of his word. He has never been the kind of person to speak carelessly.” ”

“Old Madam Lin knew that Lin Qingxuan had made up his mind this time. Otherwise, his attitude wouldn’t have been so resolute. ”

“When she thought of Lin Qingxuan being together with Xia Xiaoman, Old Madam Lin was very angry. ”

Xia Xiaoman.

A second-hand woman who had been divorced and brought along a burden.

How could she be worthy of entering the Lin family’s door.

No one knew what kind of bewitching potion Xia Xiaoman had poured into Lin Qingxuan.

“Auntie Wang continued, “This mother Xu is half-old and in her forties. Naturally, she can’t be compared to a beautiful young lady. I believe that Qingxuan will understand this one day.” ”

“Hearing this, Old Lady Lin’s eyes lit up. ”

Yes.

Auntie Wang was right.

Xia Xiaoman was already 41 years old this year. How could she compare to a beautiful young lady?

“If Lin Qingxuan knew the difference between a beautiful young lady and a second-hand goods, would lin Qingxuan still have to rely on Xia Xiaoman? ”

Definitely Not!

“Thinking of this, Old Lady Lin felt much better. ”

She would definitely find Lin Qingxuan a girl of equal status.

In the main hall.

“An Lizi saw Old Lady Lin enter the room and did not come out. She whispered to ye Zao, “Da Zao Zao, how is your grandmother?”She looked at Old Lady Lin who did not seem to be easy to talk to and felt a little uneasy. ”

“Ye Zao looked at an Lizi and continued, “To be honest, she’s not that good. Tell Auntie to be mentally prepared.” ”

“Ah?”An Lizi widened her eyes in disbelief.

“Even ye Zao, her biological granddaughter, said that Old Lady Lin was nothing much. It could be seen that Old Lady Lin was definitely not easy to get along with. ”

“Ye Zao continued to give an lizi a warning, “My grandmother is a little snobbish. She has always wanted to introduce my fourth uncle to a daughter from a well-matched family. My uncle’s previous marriage was personally ruined by her!” ”

“After saying that.., ye Zhuo continued, “But Lizi, don’t worry. As long as my fourth uncle and aunt have a deep relationship, I think nothing can destroy them! Look at my parents. Although they went through a lot of hardships, they still ended up together!” ”

“Hearing that, an Lizi nodded. She had a plan in mind. ”

“Looking at Xia Xiaoman’s side, Ye Shu and the other three sisters-in-law were also taking turns to inoculate her while fighting the landlord. ”

“Originally, they didn’t want to say anything to Xia Xiaoman, mainly because they were afraid of causing a psychological burden on her. ” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“But now, Old Mrs. Lin hadn’t come out after returning to her room. They guessed that old Mrs. Lin must be dissatisfied with Xia Xiaoman again. ”

Lin Qingxuan finally found a girlfriend that he liked. They didn’t want Xia Xiaoman to be scared away by Old Mrs. Lin like Lin Qingxuan’s first love.
