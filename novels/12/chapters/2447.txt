Chapter 2448: 514: Paranoia to the point of being incurable

Translator: 549690339

Doctor Liu was a very qualified doctor.

He could not watch his patients torture his body like this.

“He clearly could not eat these things, but he insisted on eating them!”

“He was very paranoid, so paranoid that he was incurable.”

“”Give it back to me,”song Shiyu said.”

“His tone was very indifferent, but it carried an irresistible coldness.”

His appearance was a little scary.

“Doctor Liu frowned slightly. “Boss song, do you know what your current situation is?””

“”Give it back to me,”song Shiyu said without raising his head.” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Helpless, doctor Liu could only return the cold noodles to song Shiyu.”

Song Shiyu continued eating the noodles.

“Doctor Liu sat across from him and said, “Boss song, what exactly are you doing this for?””

Doctor Liu could not understand song Shiyu.

Song Shiyu did not speak.

“”Boss song, you really can’t continue like this. Your body is yours,”doctor Liu continued to persuade him. “If your body collapses, you won’t be able to do anything.””

Nothing could compare to a healthy body.

“Seeing that song Shiyu still did not speak, doctor Liu continued, “Boss song...””

“”Shut up.”This time, song Shiyu directly interrupted doctor Liu’s next words.”

Doctor Liu could only shut up.

“Although he was song Shiyu’s personal doctor and their friendship was quite good, it was not to the point of being particularly good.”

“After eating everything, Song Shiyu looked up at doctor Liu and said, “Give me a prescription for painkillers.””

Doctor Liu was so angry that he laughed.

“He didn’t listen to me when I told you not to eat, but now you want painkillers?”

“Okay.”Doctor Liu nodded.

He was very curious. What was the reason that Cen Shaoqing would rather take painkillers than eat these junk food?

“Then, doctor Liu continued, “Boss song, although painkillers have the effect of relieving pain, it’s not a long-term solution to take them often. You should pay more attention to your eating habits.””

“Okay.”Song Shiyu acknowledged.

“Doctor Liu looked at song Shiyu and didn’t say anything more. Instead, he said, “Then please wait a moment. I’ll go get the medicine for you.””

Doctor Liu went to get the medicine for Song Shiyu.

The assistant went with him.

“Doctor Liu asked curiously, “What’s going on with Boss Song?””

The assistant shook his head. “I’m not too sure about the specific situation.”

“How long has he been like this?”Doctor Liu asked.

“The assistant said, “Yes, since yesterday.””

“Who did boss Song Meet Yesterday?”Doctor Liu looked up at the assistant.

He was very curious about what happened to Song Shiyu that caused him to become like this.

The assistant shook his head. “I didn’t follow Boss Yesterday.”

“Doctor Liu continued, “Then, is there anyone that Boss Song Can’t Love?””

Love was difficult to understand.

“Under normal circumstances, a successful person like song Shiyu would have a very difficult love life.”

“If that was the case, then doctor Liu was very curious about who song Shiyu was!”

What kind of person could make song Shiyu unable to love and be obsessed with her.

“”I don’t think so.”The assistant shook his head and continued, “Our boss rarely interacts with the opposite sex.””

“Not a single one?”Dr. Liu asked.

“The assistant had been with song Shiyu for a long time, so he knew a little about song Shiyu. He continued, “If I have to say it differently, Miss Chen’s relationship with the boss is a little special.””

“Why do you say that?”Dr. Liu asked.

“The assistant explained, “Well, Miss Chen has liked the boss for many years. She has always been by the boss’s side quietly.””

The Miss Chen the assistant mentioned was Chen Siyao.

“All these years, Chen Siyao had never gotten married, nor had she fallen in love.”

Doctor Liu shook his head. “Then it definitely isn’t this Miss Chen.”

“If song Shiyu also liked Miss Chen, then it wasn’t because he couldn’t love her.”

“What about other than Miss Chen?”Doctor Liu continued to ask.

The assistant thought for a long time and shook his head. “Then there’s nothing else.”

“That’s strange.”Dr. Liu frowned.

“If it was not because he could not love her, what did song Shiyu Encounter?”

It seemed.

All the puzzles were yesterday.

“Then, who was the person song Shiyu met yesterday?”

“The assistant continued, “Our boss’s personality has always been like this.””

“In the eyes of outsiders, Song Shiyu was a very strange person.”

“His personality was unpredictable, temperamental, and manic. In recent years, he had improved a lot, and in previous years, he often could not control himself!”

“Doctor Liu continued, “Then it’s usually quite difficult for you guys.””
