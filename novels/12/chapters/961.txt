“Chapter 962: 219: Cen Yuyan finally came to her senses. Dog Bites Dog, a mouthful of fur! 5”

“Really?”Zhou Rui was ecstatic.

“After waiting for so long, he had finally waited for this day.”

“Cen Yuyan nodded. “Of course it’s true. You also know that my fifth brother is an unmarried man. How can an unmarried man inherit the family property? Therefore, our child is now our family’s only hope.””

“”That’s great, that’s great! Yuyan! Thank you!”Zhou Rui hugged Cen Yuyan excitedly.”

“Cen Yuyan sighed. “What’s so great about it? They only accepted the child. However, my mother gave us an idea, but I felt that it wasn’t a good idea, so I rejected it.””

“What Idea?”Zhou Rui immediately asked.

“Cen Yuyan said with some difficulty, “She asked us to fake a divorce. You also know that my grandmother is old. She might leave one day. My mother meant that after my grandmother leaves, we will immediately remarry!”! “But how can that be! “Marriage is not a daughter-in-law! “I don’t agree to a divorce! “Even if it’s fake! “So my mother chased me out!””

“When he heard that Cen Yuyan was chased out by Zhou Xiang, Zhou Rui was extremely anxious. “What? You were chased out by Auntie?””

“Yes.”Cen Yuyan nodded. “She asked me to get a divorce! It’s impossible for me to divorce you!”

“Zhou Rui continued, “But isn’t that a fake divorce?”” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“”Fake divorce won’t work either!”CEN Yuyan continued, “Right now, how many people have become real divorces because of fake divorces! What if after you fake divorce me, you get together with someone else outside?””

“”I won’t!”Zhou Rui immediately swore. “Yuyan, my feelings for you can be seen by the Sun and the Moon. How can I find someone else outside!””

“At this moment, Zhou Rui still didn’t know that he had already fallen into Cen Yuyan’s trap.”

“After all, in Zhou Rui’s eyes, Cen Yuyan was just an idiot.”

How smart could she be if she was an idiot?

“As long as Cen Yuyan had some brains, she wouldn’t have been deceived to this extent by him.”

Divorce was just Cen Yuyan’s first step.

“CEN Yuyan continued, “Not only is it a fake divorce, my mother has even borrowed a loan from a loan shark in the name of us husband and wife. If we divorce, this loan shark will fall on your head and you will have to bear it alone! She said that this is to test you! “But you love me so much, yet she tests you so many times. Isn’t this an insult to your personality? “No! “I absolutely won’t allow such a thing to happen!””

“At this moment, Zhou Rui only wanted to become the CEN family’s son-in-law, so he simply couldn’t think too much, he immediately said, “It’s fine, it’s fine. I love you so much. So what if I accept a little test? As long as I can be with you, as long as the three of us can be happy, I’m willing to do anything!””

“But I’m not willing!”Cen Yuyan was a little unhappy. “My mom is really too much!”

“Zhou Rui put his arm around Cen Yuyan’s shoulder. “Yuyan, mom is also doing this for our own good. It’s really not a big deal for me to suffer a little! Don’t you want to see the three of us live happily together?””

“Cen Yuyan was a little shaken when she heard Zhou Rui’s words. “But, but...””

“”No buts,”Zhou Rui continued, “Let’s go to the Civil Affairs Bureau to settle the formalities now.””

“So Soon?”Cen Yuyan asked in surprise.

“Zhou rui smiled and said, “Isn’t this to make our mother feel at ease? Not only do I have to bear all the debts in our marriage, but I also have to leave all the assets and real estate in my name to You!””

“Zhou Xiang had borrowed the loan sharks to test him. If he were to leave everything to Cen Yuyan, he would definitely be able to make Zhou Xiang look at him in a new light.”

“In this world, other than him, how many other good men could do what he did?”

“Hearing this, Cen Yuyan was so touched that her eyes were red. She hugged Zhou Rui. “Zhou Rui, thank you! You’re So Kind!””

“”Silly, we’re husband and wife.””

“Cen Yuyan sniffed. “Zhou Rui, aren’t you afraid that I’m lying to you? What If I run away with your assets?””

“If it were anyone else, Zhou Rui would really have this worry.”

But this person was Cen Yuyan!

The Cen family’s fourth miss!

“Moreover, Cen Yuyan loved him so much!”

How could Cen Yuyan lie to him?

It wouldn’t!

“Zhou Rui turned back to Cen Yuyan and said affectionately, “Yuyan, I love you more than myself. Even if you’re really lying to me, I’m willing to be deceived by you.””

“Seeing Zhou Rui like this, Cen Yuyan’s stomach churned, and in the end, she directly retched.”
