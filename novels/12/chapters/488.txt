Chapter 489: 129: Lin Jincheng remembered everything and brought Lin Ze to find his mother! 4

Translator: 549690339

Lin Ze directly ignored Feng Xianxian and continued to walk forward.

Feng Xianxian’s eyes were filled with sarcasm.

Lin Ze was only a stray dog now. Who knew what he was so proud of!

“Feng Xianxian followed Lin Ze’s footsteps, she smiled and said, “Brother Ah Ze, Grandma told me that after my mother and uncle Lin are engaged, we will move our hukou over. Oh right, Grandma also said that she will change my surname! “By then, I will have the same surname as you. Brother Ah Ze, are you happy?””

“Seeing that Lin Ze’s face was getting darker and darker, Feng Xianxian became more and more complacent. She continued, “By the way, Grandma also said that my mom will give birth to a little brother for Uncle Lin!””

“At this point.., feng Xianxian lowered her voice and said, “Grandma also said that she will train my mom’s little brother to become the heir of the Lin Family! Brother Ah Ze, what about you? Won’t No one want you anymore? Aiya! Then you are so pitiful!””

“”Have a little brother?”Lin Ze turned his head slightly, the corners of his mouth curling into a faint smile. “That depends on whether Feng Qianhua has the ability to do so!””

“At this moment, Lin Ze seemed to have changed into a different person.”

“His eyes seemed to be covered with a layer of murderous intent, deep and bottomless.”

“Feng Xianxian was shocked. She had never seen Lin ze like this, so she unconsciously took a few steps back.”

“After saying this, Lin ze strode out of the door.”

“Only when Lin Ze walked out of the door did Feng Xianxian react. She spat at Lin Ze’s back, “Shameless bastard! Bah!””

“In the future, she would be the real blood of the Lin family.”

She would definitely make Lin Ze’s life worse than death!

“”Xianxian.”At this moment, Aunt Zhang suddenly appeared beside Feng Xianxian.”

“Feng Xianxian turned around and called out unwillingly, “Grandma Zhang.””

She would definitely not be willing to call a servant Grandma.

“However, Feng Qianhua respected Auntie Zhang very much.”

“In addition, Auntie Zhang had indeed done many things for Feng Qianhua during this period of time, so Feng Xianxian could only reluctantly call out.”

“Auntie Zhang said in a low voice, “Miss Qianhua asked me to remind you to always pay attention to your words and deeds in the Lin family.””

“Although Feng Qianhua was about to get engaged to Lin Jincheng, she was still not engaged.”

“In order to avoid complications, she had to be careful.”

“”I know,”Feng Qianqian continued, “Grandma Zhang, you don’t have to worry.””

“Seeing that Feng Qianqian was so sensible and obedient, aunt Zhang nodded in satisfaction.”

The biggest mistake Feng Qianhua made back then was to marry Feng Qianqian’s biological father. The best decision she made was to give birth to Feng Qianqian.

“Feng Xianxian was smart and intelligent, and the Lin family had been genetically programmed to only give birth to boys over the years. Feng Xianxian was just enough to satisfy Old Lady Lin’s wish to have a granddaughter.”

“Most importantly, not only was Feng Xianxian smart and intelligent, she was also beautiful. With the status of the Lin family’s eldest daughter, she would definitely be able to marry into the Cen family.”

After all.

Old Lady Cen and Old Lady Lin had such a good relationship!

“From now on, Feng Xianxian would be the Cen family’s matriarch, and Feng Qianhua and Lin Jincheng’s children would become the future successors of the Lin family.”

“A son and a daughter, both dragons and phoenixes among men!”

“Thinking of this, a faint smile appeared on Aunt Zhang’s face.”

...

“On the other side, Lin Ze came to the sanatorium.”

But Lin Jincheng was not in the ward.

“Where’s My Dad?”Lin Ze looked at the bodyguard.

“The bodyguard said, “Director Lin left with Miss Feng.””

With Feng Qianhua?

Lin Ze frowned slightly and took out his phone to call Lin Jincheng.

The phone rang.

Feng Qianhua picked up the phone and hung up.

Lin Ze did not give up and continued to call.

“Feng Qianhua really wanted to block Lin Ze’s number, but she did not know Lin Jincheng’s password, so she had to pick up the phone.”

“Dad! Where are you now?”

“Feng Qianhua said gently, “Ah Ze, it’s me.””

“Where’s My Dad? Let my dad pick up the phone.”Lin Ze frowned.

“Feng Qianhua’s gaze fell on Lin Jincheng, who was talking to a few foreigners not far away. The Breeze was just right, and the Sun wasn’t dry. Lin Jincheng was about 1.8 meters tall, not shorter than a few tall foreigners at all.”

“Although he had been sick for a long time, there was not a trace of illness on Lin Jincheng. Instead, his aura was extremely strong!”

Feng Qianhua had fallen in love with this man in front of her since she was young.

It was a pity.

“At that time, he could not see her at all.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

She was not resigned.

She tried to marry a man more outstanding than Lin Jincheng.

It was a pity.

“That man was not up to expectations. After being married for less than a year, his family was in decline, and he became a rundown household. Looking at the Lin family, although Lin Jincheng was with ye Shu all day long, the Lin family did not fall, but instead flourished, and Ye Shu could marry Lin Jincheng at any time.”
