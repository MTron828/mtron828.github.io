“However, Gu Dening kept calling her ‘miss ye’and refused to change her mind. ”

Gu dening was a very principled person.

“Strictly speaking, ye Zao was her master. If it weren’t for ye Zao, she wouldn’t be where she is today. ”

Calling ye Zao ‘Miss Ye’was a form of respect for ye Zao.

“At this moment, ye Zhuo’s phone rang. ”

Ye Zhuo picked up the phone. “Hello.” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“”Alright, I got it.” ”

“After hanging up the phone, Ye Zhuo turned to look at Gu De Ning. “Sister De Ning, can I trouble you to send my uncle back? I have something to attend to.” ”

“”Sure, no problem.”Gu De Ning nodded. ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Sister De Ning, just send my uncle to my house.” ”

“Okay.”

“After agreeing with Gu Dening, ye Zhuo walked out of the door. ”

On the other side.

In a noisy bar.

A blonde foreigner was crazily twisting his body in the middle of the dance floor.

“Mike!”

“At this moment, his partner patted his shoulder. ”

“Mike turned around and said unhappily, “What’s Wrong?” ”

His partner’s expression was a little unpleasant. “You’ll know when you come out with me.”

Mike followed his companion to the washroom.

“Compared to the deafening dance floor, the washroom was very quiet. ”

His companion handed Mike a cigarette. “Zhao Zhenfei has been discovered by the police.”

Mike was stunned.

“His companion continued, “Someone has helped to restore the surveillance cameras. Now, all the police in China are looking for you! We Can’t stay here for long. We have to leave quickly.” ”

Restore the surveillance cameras?

“Hearing this, Mike’s eyes were filled with disbelief. ”

Even Joe couldn’t restore his surveillance cameras.

A small country like China.

Who had restored the surveillance cameras?

What was going on?

“Do you know who did it?”Mike asked.

“His companion shook his head. “I’m not very sure. Anyway, we have to leave quickly and leave this place! The sooner the better!” ”

The Chinese people were really too amazing. They could even restore the surveillance cameras that had disappeared.

“If this continued, sooner or later, they would be traced back to them. When that time came, there would be no rush to leave. ”

“Therefore, they had to leave immediately. ”

“Mike narrowed his eyes. “Jerry, are you sure that they have restored the surveillance cameras?” ”

“”I’m absolutely sure!”Jerry continued, “Zhao Zhenfei was captured a few hours ago, and those wanted posters were not fake! Let’s leave quickly!” ”

“A thick, vicious look flashed across Mike’s eyes. ”

“Ever since he came to China, his record had been broken time and time again. ”

“First, the poison he personally made was cured by a little girl. ”

“Now, even the surveillance cameras were restored! ”

He didn’t believe that his whereabouts would be found by the Chinese.

Mike was an assassin.

Losing every battle was a disgrace to him.

“He had already lost once. This time, he must not lose! ”

“Moreover, no one was better at hiding than an assassin. ”

He did not believe that the Chinese police would be so lucky to catch him this time.

“Mike!”

“Seeing that Mike did not speak for a long time, Jerry called out again. ”

“Mike continued, “I won’t leave this place. If you want to leave, leave!” ”

“I’m leaving?”Jerry looked up at Mike. “What do you mean? Aren’t you coming with me?”

“Mike looked at Jerry and continued, “Only the weak will choose to escape! The truly strong will only face difficulties head-on!” ”

Even if it was fighting alone!

“Jerry sighed. “Now is not the time to be competitive! China is no longer the China of the past. Mike, quickly follow me!” ”

“”It’s just a country of ants, what’s there to be afraid of?”Mike glanced at Jerry. “Could it be that their luck will continue to be so good?” ”

“In Mike’s eyes, China had always been a country of ants, and it was not worth being afraid of. ”

“”It’s not luck, it’s strength!”Jerry continued, “It’s impossible to rely on luck to restore surveillance! This depends on strength. The current China has no lack of people with strength! “Mike, wake up. Every single one of us is growing, including China!” ”

“That means that there are people from other countries helping them behind the scenes.”Mike’s eyes were full of ridicule. “I don’t believe that that person will continue to help China!”

“Mike!”Jerry was a little angry.

“Mike continued, “You Go First!” ”

“You’ll regret it.”Jerry looked at Mike.

“Mike said, “You’re too timid.”He didn’t need such a timid companion. ”

Jerry sighed. “I hope you’ll never regret it.”
