“Chapter 705: 158: it’s the New Year! A show of affection, the Xi family’s secret for the next half month! 6”

Translator: 549690339

At the Lin family’s side.

“Halfway through the meal, the parents of each family started to give out new year’s money to the younger generation.”

“As the only girl in the family, Ye Zao received a red packet, and a few aunties not only gave ye Zao red packets, but also prepared a lot of gifts for him.”

“Beautiful little dresses, beautiful jewelry, and aunties all transferred their regrets of not being able to have a daughter to Ye Zao.”

Even the five little nephews prepared new year’s money for ye Zao.

The five little guys stood in a row and raised the red packet in their hands. “I wish Aunt Tianxian is as beautiful as a flower and will always be eighteen!”

Ye Zao was overjoyed. He also took out the red packet that he had prepared beforehand and gave it to the five little guys.

“After the New Year’s Eve dinner, the cousins discussed about setting off fireworks.”

Lin Ze went out with dog two and Fat Tiger Li Wen.

Ye Zhuo was about to go out with the five little guys to build a snowman when her cell phone rang.

Ye Zhuo picked up the phone.

“”I’m at Your House,”Cen Shaoqing’s voice came from the other end of the screen.”

“I’ll be right there.”

“As Ye Zhuo spoke, he picked up his scarf and put it on, then walked out of the door.”

“It was a festival, and there were colorful lights everywhere.”

“As soon as ye Zao stepped out of the door, snowflakes started to fall from the sky.”

“When he walked out of the door, he saw a black car parked by the fountain. A slender figure was leaning against the car door. Because of the cold weather, Cen Shaoqing had added a long black windbreaker on top of his long robe, although he didn’t do anything at the moment, he gave off a powerful aura.”

It was beyond his reach.

“Cen Shaoqing.”Ye Zao jogged over.

Cen Shaoqing looked back slightly and reached out to hug her. He wrapped her in his coat. “Are you cold?”

Ye Zao wrapped his arms around his slim waist. His nose was filled with the unique scent of his body. There was a faint sandalwood scent. “It’s okay. It’s not very cold.”

“The snow continued to drift. In a short while, their hair was dyed white.”

CEN Shaoqing reached out and brushed the snow off her head. “I’ll take you somewhere.”

“”Where are We Going?”Ye Zhuo looked up at him. From her angle, she could just see the man’s chin with stubble sticking out.”

Ye Zhuo reached out and touched it.

“It was a little different from what he had imagined. Perhaps it was because his beard had not fully grown out yet. It was not very prickly, but it was a little painful.”

He did not expect her to suddenly attack him.

“Cen Shaoqing was stunned. His entire body was on fire, and he finally focused on a certain spot.”

“Ye Zao continued, “How often do you shave your beard?””

“Cen Shaoqing tried his best not to let his imagination run wild. He opened his thin lips and said,”... about once every two days.”” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

He grew so fast just by shaving once every two days?

Ye Zhuo suddenly thought of a joke.

The joke said that a man with a lot of hair also had a lot of needs.

He didn’t know if it was true.

“Thinking of this, Ye Zhuo suddenly blushed and quickly changed the topic. “Where are you taking me?””

Cen Shaoqing opened the door of the passenger seat. “You’ll know when you get there.”

Ye Zhuo got into the car and took off his scarf.

Cen Shaoqing did not get into the car immediately. He stood outside and took in two deep breaths of cold air before opening the door of the driver’s seat.

“After getting into the car, Cen Shaoqing opened the refrigerator in the car and took out a bottle of ice mineral water. He gulped down two mouthfuls of it and his sexy Adam’s apple moved up and down. It was indescribably sexy.”

Ye Zao was a little confused. “You’re still drinking ice water on such a Cold Day?”Aren’t you afraid of freezing to death?

Cen Shaoqing slowly twisted the cap of the bottle. “I’ve been a little angry recently.”

“Ye Zao continued, “Why don’t I prescribe some medicine to make you angry?””

This medicine couldn’t be used with ordinary fire.

Cen Shaoqing’s expression didn’t change. “There’s no need. I’ve already taken the medicine to make me angry at home.”

“OH.”Ye Zao turned on the music in the car.

“Soon, the car was filled with pleasant music.”

“It was snowing outside, and Cen Shaoqing was not driving fast either. He followed the car lights and waited until he saw the snowflakes dancing in the air.”

Ye Zao liked this snowy night very much. He laid the back of his chair flat and lay on it. He crossed his legs and sang along with the music as he admired the snowy scenery outside.

Cen Shaoqing looked at her in the rearview mirror and the corners of his mouth curled up slightly.

“About half an hour later, the car slowly came to a stop.”

Ye Zao looked out of the window. “Are we here?”

“”Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and continued, “Close your eyes first. I want to give you a surprise.””

“What Surprise?”Ye Zao closed his eyes as he was told.

“Cen Shaoqing opened the door and got out of the car. He went around to the front passenger seat, pulled open the door, and reached out to hold ye Zhuo’s hand. “Follow me out of the car. Be careful of the stairs.””

Ye Zhuo followed Cen Shaoqing out of the car.

“The two of them walked for about a minute before Cen Shaoqing’s voice rang in their ears. “Leader, you can open your eyes now.””

Ye Zhuo slowly opened his eyes.

At this moment.

Countless fireworks bloomed from the horizon!

“Red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and purple. The bright fireworks were reflected in that pair of clear eyes, and they were very dazzling.”

“In the end, these fireworks formed three words.”

Qing Mu Zao.

She looked at the fireworks.

He looked at her.

His gaze was doting.

“His eyes could accommodate everything in the world, but at this moment, they could only accommodate one of her.”

“Do you like it?”

“I like it.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Oh right, I have another gift for you.””

“What?”

Cen Shaoqing took out a small box. “Open it and take a look.”

Ye Zhuo opened the lid.

He saw a small portrait lying in the box. The features were clearly cut according to her outline.

“You Cut This?”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Am I Good?”

“Good! You’re really good!”Ye Zhuo picked up the portrait and studied it carefully. All her fondness was displayed in her eyes.

“Seeing her like this, Cen Shaoqing suddenly felt that the sweat and hard work in the afternoon was worth it.”

...

On the other side.

At the Xi family home.

“It was supposed to be a day of family reunion, but ye Langhua was sitting in her room, holding a child’s clothes in her hands and weeping alone.”

“The older she got, the more afraid she was of the New Year.”

She didn’t know how her daughter was living now.

She didn’t even know if she was still alive.

“Sometimes, she even wanted to die so that she could go to the other world to find her daughter.”

But she was afraid that her daughter would still be waiting for her in this world.

“If she died, wouldn’t her daughter have no mother?”

“”Listen, she’s crying inside again!”Yang Jiao heard the commotion inside and frowned slightly. “It’s the New Year and she’s really unlucky!””

“Xi Muwen, who was beside her, also frowned. “Bear with it, at least until she reveals that secret.””

“Yang Jiao sighed and turned to look at Xi Weiyue. “Weiyue, knock on the door.””
