Cen Shaoqing did not say a word. He twirled the prayer beads in his hand.

“Wang Zhenzhong walked forward, then he said, “To say the least, even if miss ye really created an aircraft carrier, so what? The bet agreement clearly stated that the aircraft carrier’s flying speed must exceed the speed of light! Do you think miss ye can surpass the speed of light?” ”

“Currently, the fastest speed was the speed of light. ”

To surpass the speed of light and land on the eight planets was practically a pipe dream.

“Even in a dream, such a good thing might not happen! ”

Exceed the speed of light?

Who would dare to think about it?

“However, not only did ye zhuo dare to think about it, he also did not know the immensity of Heaven and earth and wanted to set up a betting agreement. ”

“When the few elders saw the news on the international internet, they thought that they were blind. ”

How could someone be so stupid as to sign such a bet?

Wasn’t he jumping into the fire pit himself?

“It was one thing for ye Zao to jump, but now he had to implicate the Cen family base. ”

“These people were all elders of the base. Their starting point was also for the base’s sake. Cen Shaoqing raised his eyes slightly and placed the Buddhist scripture on the table, “Elder Wang, let alone surpassing the speed of light, even if ye Zao said she could travel through time and space and create a time-space shuttle, I would still believe it.” ”

Wang Zhenzhong’s blood ran cold in his heart.

Crazy!

Crazy!

Cen Shaoqing was simply crazy.

Space-time shuttle?

Did he know what he was talking about?

“Sun Qi couldn’t help but say, “Master Five, don’t you think that what you said is too ridiculous?” ”

Space-time shuttle?

It was fortunate that Cen Shaoqing dared to say it!

“”It’s simply ridiculous to the extreme,”Chu Jiangtao, who had been silent beside Sun Qi, said, “Master five! You are not responsible for the Cen family’s base, and you are even more irresponsible for us! Have you thought about the consequences once you sign the BET agreement? Who will bear the consequences!” ”

“”I will naturally bear the consequences for my people!”Cen Shaoqing’s voice did not change much, but it made the three elders tremble. ”

“”Alright, all of you can leave.”Cen Shaoqing raised his hand slightly. ”

“The three elders did not move. A moment later, Wang Zhenzhong stood out and said, “Fifth master, we don’t agree!” ”

“Hearing this, the other two immediately said, “Yes, we don’t agree!” ”

“Don’t agree to what?”Cen Shaoqing raised his phoenix-like eyes.

His pair of deep eyes were so dark that it was almost impossible to see the bottom.

Wang Zhenzhong gulped. “We don’t agree to use Miss Ye’s base as a bargaining chip to sign the BET Agreement!”

“Have the three elders already forgotten what the base’s surname is?”Cen Shaoqing asked in return.

What was the base’s surname?

“The Cen family base’s surname was, of course, Cen. ”

“Hearing this, the three of them immediately shut up. ”

The implied meaning of Cen Shaoqing’s words was that the three of them were not qualified to disagree!

“The three of them had followed Cen Shaoqing all the way through middle-age. Naturally, they knew Cen Shaoqing’s temper. After looking at each other, they decided not to say anything more. “Fifth master, we’ll be leaving First!” ”

“After saying that, the three of them walked out of the office. ”

“The moment they walked out of the office door, the three of them heaved a heavy sigh of relief. ”

Cen Shaoqing gave off a really strong sense of oppression!

It would be great if Cen Shaoqing could treat them the way he treated ye Zao!

“”Old Brother Sun, what do you think we should do?”Wang Zhenzhong looked at Sun Qi with a frown. ”

“Sun Qi frowned and sighed. “I can see that fifth master has really fallen into the trap this time! Let’s not try to persuade him anymore. It’s useless no matter how much we persuade him!”Cen Shaoqing had already said so much today, if they tried to persuade him again, they would only bring trouble to themselves. ”

“Chu Jiang Tao continued, “Do we have to watch the Cen family base be destroyed by ye Zao?” ”

He had watched the Cen family base until now. He was really unwilling to let the Cen family base be lost just like that.

“”What else can I do if I don’t do this?”Sun Qi said somewhat helplessly, “Let’s do it like this! “We’re old anyway. Some things are better left alone!”! “Anyway, we’ve already said what we should have said. It was fifth master who didn’t listen to us. In the future, he won’t blame us!” ”

Wang Zhenzhong nodded. “Old Brother Sun is right.”

“The Cen family’s base was Cen Shaoqing’s after all. The real management rights were in Cen Shaoqing’s hands. They could only persuade Cen Shaoqing. Since CEN Shaoqing didn’t listen, there was nothing they could do. ”

The three of them discussed as they walked.

“When Tang Xue saw this scene, she walked up and said, “Uncle Sun, uncle Wang, Uncle Chu! Are you guys coming from Fifth Master’s Office?” ”

“Little Tang!”Sun Qi nodded.

“Tang Xue continued, “Uncles, you guys are looking for fifth master because of the BET agreement, right? Right now, everyone in the base is feeling insecure. They’re all worried that Miss Ye will lose the base. None of us want to work in the hands of foreigners. What did fifth master say?” ”
