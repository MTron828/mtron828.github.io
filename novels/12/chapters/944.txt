Translator: 549690339

“What true love!”Cen Yuyan scoffed. “She’s clearly acting! My fifth brother would never fall for a scheming woman like her!”

“Song Chenyu patted Cen Yuyan’s hand. “Alright, Alright. No matter how bad she is, she’s still fifth master’s girlfriend. I’m worried that trouble will come out of her mouth.””

“Hearing these words, Cen Yuyan thought of Cen Shaoqing’s two slaps and immediately shut her mouth.”

“The reason Cen Shaoqing gave her two slaps back then was because she did not care about Cen Shaoqing’s face. She said a lot of bad things about ye Zhuo in front of Cen Shaoqing, so Cen Shaoqing became angry out of humiliation.”

“Actually, Cen Shaoqing was not venting his anger on Ye Zhuo at all. He was angry that she did not give him face.”

“Just as song Chenyu said, even if ye Zao was not doing well, he was still Cen Shaoqing’s girlfriend. By saying that about ye Zao, she was actually slapping Cen Shaoqing’s face.”

“Now that she thought about it, Cen Yuyan really regretted it.”

She should not have been so reckless back then.

“If she had spoken to Cen Shaoqing in private, Cen Shaoqing definitely would not have slapped her.”

“Song Chenyu held Cen Yuyan’s arm. “The injury on your face is not light. Let’s go to the hospital to have a look, shall we?””

“Cen Yuyan smiled and said, “It’s a small problem. We don’t need to go to the hospital.””

“Song chenyu frowned and said, “How can we not go to the hospital! ! If we go to the hospital, we can get the doctor to prescribe some medicine. It will also help us recover faster. I know a doctor in a private clinic who is very good at treating injuries caused by injuries. It’s not far from here. Let’s go together.””

Cen Yuyan needed people’s care and comfort the most right now. Song Chenyu naturally would not miss this good opportunity.

“Without Cen Yuyan as a stepping stone, how could she enter the Cen Family?”

Song Chenyu pulled Cen Yuyan and walked out. “Let’s go quickly.”

“Seeing how concerned song Chenyu was for her, Cen Yuyan felt a myriad of emotions in her heart.”

It was really worth it to have a close friend like song Chenyu in her life.

“Although they were not related by blood, they were better than biological sisters.”

“If not for Old Lady Cen’s interference, Song Chenyu would have long been her sister-in-law.”

Thinking of this.

Cen Yuyan frowned.

“In the past, she did not know what a troublemaker meant.”

Now she finally knew.

Someone like Old Lady Cen was a troublemaker.

She did not know how Zhou Xiang and Cen Shaoqing could tolerate her.

“The more Cen Yuyan thought about it, the angrier she got.”

Song Chenyu brought Cen Yuyan to the private clinic.

The doctor prescribed some medicine for Cen Yuyan and told her not to eat cold and spicy food for the next few days.

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “Okay, I’ll remember it.””

On the other side.

At the Zhou family home.

“Zhou Rui was extremely anxious. “Mom, the medicine you gave me is not enough! Why is Cen Yuyan’s stomach still not moving?”Zhou Rui had originally suspected that Cen Yuyan was a hen that could not lay eggs, but now he was even more suspicious.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“An old woman was indeed an old woman, she didn’t even know how to give birth!”

“Mother Zhou wasn’t anxious at all, “Giving birth isn’t a game, how can you get pregnant just like that? It’s only half a month. Under normal circumstances, it would take one or two months to get pregnant. Anyway, CEN Yuyan has already rushed here, are you still afraid that she’ll run away?””

Zhou Rui being able to take a liking to Cen Yuyan was simply a blessing that the CEN family and Cen Yuyan had cultivated in their past lives.

An old woman who could not be married off.

Could it be that she still wanted to be a demon?

“”But I can’t wait any longer.”Zhou Rui continued, “Mom, do you have any other ideas?””

“Seeing Zhou Rui like this, mother Zhou frowned. “How about this, I’ll prescribe some pregnancy-enhancing drugs and you let her drink it once a day.””

“”Okay, thank you, Mom.””

Mother Zhou passed the prescribed prescription to Zhou Rui. “Taking too much of this medicine is not good for your body. Don’t put too much at once.”

“Zhou Rui nodded. “Alright, I got it.””

“After bringing the prescription that mother Zhou had given him back, Zhou Rui began to brew the medicine.”

“The moment she got home, Cen Yuyan smelled a strong medicinal smell. When she saw Zhou Rui at home, she asked in surprise, “Why did you come back so early today?””

“Zhou Rui continued, “I saw that you were so thin and didn’t sleep well at night, so I grabbed some tonic from the pharmacy to let you replenish your body.””

“Cen Yuyan didn’t expect Zhou Rui to be so meticulous. She smiled and said, “How did you know that I didn’t sleep well at night?””

“Zhou Rui looked at Cen Yuyan. “I’m the person next to you. I’m going to spend the rest of my life with you. If I can’t even see through such a small problem, then what right do I have to be with you?””

“Cen Yuyan was very touched when she heard that. She hugged Zhou Rui from behind. “Zhou Rui, thank you.””
