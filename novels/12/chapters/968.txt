Secretary Yang quickened his pace and walked out.

“Ten minutes later, Secretary Yang sent the things he had packed to Song Shiyu.”

Ding —

“At this moment, the elevator door facing the office opened.”

“Secretary Yang looked up and saw a figure walking out of the elevator. Looking up from his long legs, he saw that the person’s facial features were covered by a mask and sunglasses.”

“However, he could still tell from the figure that this person was song Chenyu.”

“When Secretary Yang Saw Song Chenyu, he immediately went up to her. “Miss Song, you’re here.””

Song Chenyu took off her sunglasses. “Is my third brother here?”

Secretary Yang nodded. “The boss is inside.”

Song Chenyu lifted her feet and walked inside.

“”Miss Song, Please Wait a moment,”secretary Yang suddenly said.”

“What’s Wrong?”Song Chenyu lowered her head and asked.

“Secretary Yang continued, “The boss already knows about your matter. He’s reading Weibo inside now. Why Don’t you wait a moment before going in?””

“”My third brother already knows?”Song Chenyu thought that with song Shiyu’s character, he would not take the initiative to ask about her matters.”

He did not expect song Shiyu to dote on her more than he imagined.

“Before she could speak, song Shiyu had already taken the initiative to look at Weibo.”

“One had to know that song Shiyu was an eccentric person. He never used those social media apps. He did not even use wechat, let alone Weibo.”

“Secretary Yang nodded. “Not only that, but boss also knows about the incident last time.””

“What incident?”Song Chenyu asked curiously.

“Secretary Yang continued, “It’s about the incident where you were injured in the village 2 production team. The boss even specially asked for the video from that time.””

“Only then did song Chenyu understand why when Song Shi went to visit the production team, not only did she not ask about her injury, but she even treated ye Zhuo with courtesy.”

So it was because she did not know!

“Now that the old matter was brought up again, not only would the Zhou family be in trouble, even ye Zhuo would be in trouble as well.”

How satisfying!

This was simply too satisfying!

“Thinking of this, song Shiyu raised his hand and knocked on the door.”

“Who is it?”A very cold word came from inside.

“Song Shiyu smiled and said, “Third brother, it’s me! Shiyu!””

“Come in.”

Song Shiyu immediately pushed the door open and entered.

“Song Shiyu was just sitting on the boss’s chair like this, and no expression could be seen on his face.”

“For some reason, when he saw song Shiyu like this, song Shiyu suddenly shivered. “Third brother.””

“Why didn’t you tell me about the incident at the village production team?”Song Shiyu suddenly asked.

Was he going to make trouble?

“Song Shiyu suppressed the joy in his heart, he smiled and said, “It wasn’t a big deal in the first place, so I didn’t tell you. Third Brother, don’t blame Miss Ye. This matter has nothing to do with Miss Ye. It’s all my fault. I almost implicated Miss Ye!””

“Song Shiyu raised his head and looked at song Chenyu. He slowly undid the cufflinks, then rolled up his sleeves one by one, revealing his strong arms.”

What was he trying to do?

Song Chenyu was stunned.

Crash —

Song Shiyu suddenly stood up from the boss’s chair and pushed it behind him.

“His posture was slender. When he stood up, a strong shadow cast directly on song Chenyu.”

“Song Shiyu’s body was full of hostility. Even if he deliberately restrained it, it still made it difficult for people to breathe. Song Chenyu gulped. She did not understand what song Shiyu was trying to do?”

But she knew one thing.

That Was...

He was angry.

Song Shiyu was angry.

“Song Chenyu smiled and raised his head, then he said, “Third brother, it’s been so long. Even if something really happened, I Won’t blame Miss Ye. Please Don’t blame Miss Ye.”. You and Cen Wuye are friends after all. If you really go and make things difficult for Miss Ye for me, it will be... “... “...””

“Before song Chenyu could finish her sentence, she received a heavy slap on her face.”

Slap!

The crisp sound of the slap completely replaced her voice.

“This slap made song Chenyu’s Ears Buzz, and her face burned with pain.”

“Who told you to bully her? Huh?”

“Before song Chenyu could react, her hair was grabbed tightly by a long and strong hand.”

“An intense pain came from her scalp, as if her entire scalp was about to be torn off.”

“Combined with the pain on her face, she simply could not breathe.”

“”Third... third brother?”Song Chenyu raised her head to look at Song Shiyu. Other than the painful expression in her eyes, there was only disbelief.”

This was the second time song Shiyu had hit her.

The first time was because of that hairpin. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“After all, that hairpin was left behind by song Shiyu’s mother, so it was completely understandable for song Shiyu to hit her.”
