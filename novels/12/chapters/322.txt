Not letting him smoke?

The corners of Cen Shaoqing’s lips curled up slightly.

“Ye Zao was concerned about him, right? ”

“[ okay, I’ll quit smoking in the future. ] ”

“[ my mom asked me to eat, I’m going to eat first. ] ”

[ Okay. ]

“Very soon, CEN Shaoqing received another picture from ye Zao. It should be her lunch. ”

Seven dishes and one soup. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The lunch was very rich.

Cen Shaoqing immediately called his secretary. “Send my lunch over.”

Send Lunch?

Didn’t they say they wouldn’t eat lunch?

“The assistant was a little surprised, but he still sent the lunch over within ten minutes. ”

Cen Shaoqing opened the lid and took a picture of ye Zao and sent it over.

Ye Zao opened the picture Cen Shaoqing sent over and raised his eyebrows slightly.

As expected of a vegetarian.

“Other than bean products, all of them were vegetable leaves. ”

[ do you like to eat leaves that much? ]

Eat... leaves?

Cen Shaoqing looked at these words and could not help but smile. Warmth appeared in his eyes.

“[ because the leaves are delicious, fresh and juicy. ] ”

“When ye Zao saw these words, he raised his eyebrows slightly. ”

“If it was someone else, she would definitely suspect that the other party was flirting with her. ”

But this person was Cen Shaoqing.

Who Was Cen Shaoqing?

He was a monk!

Did he know what flirting was?

[ I don’t understand the world of monks. ]

Cen Shaoqing replied: [ I’m not a monk. Just because I don’t eat meat now doesn’t mean I won’t eat meat in the future. ]

“Ye Zhuo teased, [ wine and meat pass through the intestines of Buddha’s heart? ] ”

Just as Cen Shaoqing was about to reply.

A video call came in.

It was Cen Yueya.

Cen Shaoqing then remembered that he had forgotten to reply to Cen Yueya.

“However, he did not answer it. Instead, he directly hung up and continued replying to Ye Zao’s message, [ yes, that’s the reason. ] ”

Ye Zao conveniently sent out a [ what a retard ] Kumamoto Bear Emoji Package.

Looking at this Kumamoto Bear.

Cen Shaoqing raised his eyebrows slightly.

This bear seemed to be a little vulgar.

It actually used profanity.

What did ye Zhuofa mean by giving him this emoji package?

Did he dislike him for being too stupid?

[ my IQ is 170. ]

“When ye Zhuo saw this sentence on the other end of the screen, he almost spat out rice. Sure enough, a monk was a monk. ”

He didn’t even understand the emoji package.

After replying to Ye Zhuo’s message.

Cen Shaoqing then unhurriedly opened Cen Yueya’s dialog box and sent her a video.

Cen Yueya quickly received the video.

“On the other end of the video was Cen Yueya’s exasperated face. “Cen Laowu, What’s wrong with you? Why haven’t you replied to me for so long? Don’t you know that I’m waiting for your reply?” ”

“Cen Yueya had an impatient and hot temper. Compared to the unsmiling Cen Shaoqing, she was from a completely different world. ”

They didn’t look like siblings at all.

“Cen Shaoqing said seriously, “I was processing documents just now and did not see your message.” ”

“CEN yueya ridiculed, “Processing documents! Processing documents! You only know how to process documents! I think you might as well just live with documents in the future! You deserve to not be able to get a wife until now! I think you are destined to be a bachelor for the rest of your life!” ”

“In Cen Yueya’s eyes, Cen Shaoqing had always been a workaholic. ”

He would either go to the temple to listen to the sounds of Buddha.

Therefore.

“When Cen Shaoqing said that he was processing documents, CEN Yueya did not doubt it at all. ”

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Second sister, what’s the matter?” ”

Cen Yueya then remembered the serious matter. “When are you guys planning to return to the capital?”

“”Around September,”Cen Shaoqing answered. ”

Cen Yueya narrowed her eyes. “September? So It’s true?”

“What’s true and false?”

“Cen Yueya had a wicked smile on her face. “I heard Grandma say that she has found a beautiful wife for you, right?” ”

“Don’t listen to the wind and rain.”Cen Shaoqing’s tone was indifferent.

“CEN Yueya continued, “I also heard that my future sister-in-law is extremely beautiful! She is a rare beauty! She is a thousand times, ten thousand times, better looking than Mu Yourong, who looks through the crack of the door! “Oh Right, let me show you this and this. These are all gifts I prepared for my future sister-in-law!” The video was aimed at CEN Yueya’s jewelry desk. ”

The entire jewelry desk was filled to the brim and could barely fit any more items.

“”Oh right, does my future sister-in-law have oily skin or dry skin? “I’m preparing to customize a set of skincare products for her overseas. I don’t know what color lipstick she likes, so I bought all the lipstick numbers from Dior and Armani’s family!” ”

“Do you think this set of red agate jewelry looks good?”? “I specially auctioned this set of jewelry at the auction house!”! “I heard that the former princess of country y even wore it before!”! “This red is the best color for a beauty!”! “This set of jewelry will definitely look super good on my future sister-in-law!”
