“At this point, Auntie Sun grabbed Xia Xiaoman’s hand again. “Madam, in the past year, I’ve done my best for my family. I’ve never done anything to let you down. You must believe me!” ”

“Sun Jiayi also reacted at this time. “Yes, Madam! You can’t conclude that my mother has done such a thing just because of a few words from the eldest miss! My mother isn’t that kind of person. You Can’t let a good person’s heart go cold!” ”

“The Butler walked forward. “Madam, this is not a small matter. We have to investigate thoroughly before we can come to a conclusion. Auntie Sun is usually serious in her work. She is also an amiable person. I also believe in her.” ”

“Seeing that the butler also believed in her, auntie sun heaved a sigh of relief. ”

It seemed that it was not wrong to have a good relationship with the servants at home!

“Xia Xiaoman raised her head to look at Ye Zao. “Zao Zao, are you sure there’s a problem with this medicine?” ”

Ye Zao nodded slightly. “I’m sure.”

“Her five senses were already different from ordinary people, and she was also a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner. Almost as soon as the medicine was brought to her, she realized that the medicine was wrong. Furthermore, she could smell the same contraceptive pill on Auntie Sun’s body as it was in the medicine. ”

“Therefore, this matter was definitely related to Auntie Sun. ”

“Xia Xiaoman took a few steps back and looked at Auntie Sun. “It’s not bad for me to take care of you! Why are you treating me like this!”Xia Xiaoman believed in ye Zao. Since ye Zao was so sure, there must be a contraceptive pill in this medicine! ”

“”No! Madam, I was really wronged!”Auntie Sun directly knelt on the ground, she cried, “Heaven and earth, I really didn’t do anything to let you down! Miss said that I put birth control pills in the medicine. What is the benefit for me? What is my motive for doing this?” ”

“”The motive is very simple.”Ye Zhuo turned to look at Sun Jiayi, “You want your daughter to interfere in the marriage of my fourth uncle and fourth aunt. If my fourth aunt continues to be infertile, your daughter Sun Jiayi can take the opportunity to rise to the position. I don’t know if I’m Right!” ”

“After being exposed by ye Zhuo’s words, Aunt Sun’s face turned from white to pale. ”

How did ye Zhuo see through it?

She was only twenty years old!

Terrifying!

It was really too terrifying!

“Nonsense! You’re insulting my dignity!”Sun Jiayi’s expression was very ugly. “Do you have evidence? What evidence do you have to prove that what you said is right? I’m going to Sue You!”

Ye Zhuo turned to look at the butler. “I’ll have to trouble uncle Butler to call the police.”

The butler nodded. “Alright.”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “As for the evidence, this bowl of medicine is the evidence. I believe that the police will definitely handle this matter fairly and justly.” ”

Medicine.

“Now that this bowl of medicine had become the most crucial evidence, as long as he took it to be tested, what else could not be tested? ” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

No.

He could not let the police get hold of this bowl of medicine.

“A vicious glint flashed across Auntie Sun’s eyes. She suddenly pounced over, wanting to grab the bowl of medicine and smash it into pieces. ”

“As long as the evidence was destroyed, everything would be fine. ”

“No one expected Auntie Sun to do this. Just as Auntie Sun was about to grab the medicine and throw it away, Ye Zhuo took a step forward and picked up the bowl of medicine. He dodged Auntie Sun’s grab and looked down at Auntie Sun, “Since the medicine is fine, Why Are You So Nervous? Do you want to destroy the evidence?” ”

“”No! I don’t want to destroy the evidence! It has nothing to do with me!”Auntie Sun knelt on the ground. “Madam, please believe me! I really didn’t do those things. Miss is framing me!” ”

“”Since you didn’t do it, why did you snatch the Medicine Just Now?”Xia Xiaoman looked at Auntie Sun, her eyes filled with pain, “Auntie Sun, I’ve always treated you as my family. I didn’t expect you to repay me like this! Do you still have a conscience?” ”

“An Lizi usually lived in school. Although she didn’t get along with Auntie Sun much, she knew that Xia Xiaoman treated Auntie Sun very well. Moreover, Auntie Sun was usually an honest person. She couldn’t tell that she actually had such intentions. ”

It was really too scary!

“Fortunately, Ye Zhuo was here today. ”

“Otherwise, her family would be turned upside down by her in the future! ”

“I think her conscience has been eaten by the dog!”An Lizi pointed at Auntie Sun and scolded angrily.

The Lin family’s sisters-in-law were also very surprised.

None of them had expected that Xia Xiaoman’s infertility was man-made.

“Lin Qingxuan was playing mahjong with his brothers at the back. When he heard that something had happened in the front hall, he immediately ran over. “What happened! ?” ”

“Yang Wenyin said, “Fourth brother, there’s a traitor in your family! I was wondering why fourth brother and sister couldn’t get pregnant. It turns out that someone has dirty thoughts! It’s really disgusting!” This was the first time Yang Wenyin had encountered such a thing. As a servant, she actually dared to drug her boss! She even had the idea of becoming a Phoenix! ”
