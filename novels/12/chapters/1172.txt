It was a very simple sentence.

But it was loud and clear.

Words?

Zhao Xueyin was stunned again.

Something didn’t seem right.

“Didn’t Ye, Ye Zhuo come over to ask for her help? ”

Weren’t these documents the Jiang Financial Group’s consent forms?

Zhao Xueyin quickly picked up the documents that were thrown on the table.

“There were three documents in total, and they had nothing to do with the Jiang Financial Group. They were all signed with her name and her seal. ”

The date was three days ago.

“I signed them. What’s Wrong?”Zhao Xueyin raised her head.

She wanted to see what tricks Ye Zhuo was trying to pull.

“Ye Zhuo slowly said, “Think of a way to fix the funding loophole on them. Then, go to the board of directors and explain yourself.” ”

“After saying this, Ye Zhuo turned around and left. ”

What?

Funding loophole?

Zhao Xueyin picked up the document again and looked at it carefully.

When she looked at it.

Her face turned pale.

“How, how could this be? ”

How could there be so many loopholes in these three documents? Why didn’t she notice it when she personally did it?

She lost a total of 30 million.

“Normally, 30 million was nothing to Zhao Xueyin. ”

But it was different now.

The Day of the Jiang Financial Group’s chief election was coming up.

She couldn’t afford to make any mistakes.

“Once the people on the board of directors knew about this, she wouldn’t even be qualified to run for the chief election. ”

On purpose.

Ye Zao did it on purpose.

“She deliberately took out these things at this time, so that she wouldn’t run for the election. ”

“After all, she was ye Zhuo’s only competitor. ”

“If she could not participate in the election, then ye Zhuo would have nothing to worry about. ”

“Ten minutes ago, Zhao Xueyin was very pleased with herself, but now, Zhao Xueyin was very anxious. ”

What should she do now?

Zhao Xueyin’s body was covered in cold sweat as she tried to calm herself down.

“At this moment, Zhao Xueyin suddenly thought of the lawyer. ”

Yes.

And Si Lui.

“Si lui liked her so much, he would definitely think of a way to help her. ”

“Now, the only person who could help her was Si lui. ”

“Zhao Xueyin took out her phone and dialed Si Lui’s number. Her voice trembled as she said, “Big Brother Si, can you come up now?” ”

“Hearing that Zhao Xueyin’s voice was not right, Si lui hurriedly said, “Xueyin, don’t worry, I’ll come up right away.” ”

“After hanging up, the lawyer threw away the things he was doing and took the elevator to the 58th floor. He jogged all the way to Zhao Xueyin’s office. ”

“Chairman Si!”

“Before Annie could react, the lawyer had already pushed the door open and entered. ”

Annie scratched her hair.

“The lawyer came to the office and asked nervously, “Xueyin, what happened?” ”

“When she saw lawyer si, Zhao Xueyin calmed down a little. She stood up and handed the documents on the table to lawyer Si. “Brother Si, take a look at this.” ”

“Lawyer si reached out to take it. When he took a look, his expression changed. “Xueyin, did you sign all these?” ”

There was obviously something wrong with these documents.

“Under normal circumstances, Zhao Xueyin should not have made such an obvious mistake. ”

“Zhao Xueyin frowned. “I don’t know what’s going on either. I don’t remember signing these words, but the handwriting and seal are indeed mine...” ”

“At the end of her sentence, Zhao Xueyin’s eyes turned slightly red, but she still held back her tears to prevent them from falling. ”

“”Xueyin, don’t worry.”The lawyer continued to ask, “Who brought these documents to you?” ”

“Zhao Xueyin said, “It was ye Zhuo who took them.” ”

“Ye Zhuo?”Si lui frowned. “It’s Ye Zhuo again.”

It was obvious.

Zhao Xueyin had been schemed against by Ye Zhuo.

Ye Zhuo must have gotten someone to imitate Zhao Xueyin’s handwriting.

“At the moment, the signature had been signed, the seal had been stamped, and the plan had been carried out. ”

Zhao Xueyin had no choice but to accept this loss.

It seemed that he had underestimated ye Zhuo.

Si Lu did not expect ye Zhuo to make a move on Zhao Xueyin.

And he did it in such an unspeakable manner!

“Unfortunately, they did not have any evidence to prove that ye Zhuo was the one who had done this. ”

“Zhao Xueyin’s face was full of worry. “Big Brother Si, it’s going to be the day of the chief election soon. What do you think I should do?” ”

“”Xueyin, you’ve never signed these words before!”Si lui turned to look at Zhao Xueyin with a firm gaze. ”

“What?”Zhao Xueyin was stunned and couldn’t react for a moment.

“Si lui continued, “These words were signed by me. It has nothing to do with you.”Now was the crucial moment for Zhao Xueyin to advance to the chief. She couldn’t make any mistakes. ”

“No matter what, he had to protect Zhao Xueyin! ”

“Zhao Xueyin said, “Big Brother Si, I know you want to help me, but these are all my signatures. They have nothing to do with you...” ”
