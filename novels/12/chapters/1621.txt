“It would have been fine if this person was someone else, but this person was her daughter! ”

Her own daughter!

How could Xiao Qing remain indifferent!

“”Then didn’t you ask Miss Ye?”Xiao Qing continued, “The launch ceremony is in a few days! You Don’t even know how many people are waiting to see the joke on the internet right now! “If the aircraft carrier plan fails, you should also come up with a countermeasure. You Can’t just sit around and wait for Death!” ”

“Tang mi said, “Mom, how can I ask Miss Ye at a time like this? ! Aiya! “Don’t worry. Even if the aircraft carrier plan really fails, it’s not a big deal. At most, I’ll just retire from the scientific research world!” ”

“At this moment, asking ye Zao would only add to ye Zao’s worries. ”

It was better not to ask.

Wait for God’s will.

Xiao Qing looked at Tang Mi and sighed again.

“”Okay, mom, don’t Sigh.”Tang mi cupped Xiao Qing’s face with both hands. “BE HAPPY! Look, I’m not in a hurry! We have to believe in Miss Ye, and we have to believe in Miracles!” ”

Believe in Miracles?

“Outside the door, Tang Mi’s mouth was full of sarcasm when she heard this. ”

“If miracles appeared so easily, it wouldn’t be called a miracle! ”

“It seemed that the aircraft carrier plan was really going to fail. Otherwise, Tang Mi wouldn’t have said that she had to believe in miracles. ”

“Tang mi immediately turned around and walked out of the door. When she reached home, she looked at Tang Xue and said with a smile, “Xiaoxue, guess what I heard next door!” ”

“What did you hear?”Tang Xue asked curiously.

“Tang continued, “Tang Mi told Xiao Qing to believe in miracles! Don’t you think it’s laughable!” ”

“They are at their wit’s End!”The corner of Tang Xue’s mouth was full of sarcasm.

“Tang continued, “Have you contacted the C Nation headquarters in the past few days? You have to stay close at this time! You Can’t let others take away your credit!” ”

“”Don’t worry, Mom. The headquarters value me very much,”Tang Xue said. ”

She was the only informant in the C Nation headquarters in China.

Both William and the headquarters were very polite to her!

“Really?”Tang asked in surprise.

“Yes.”Tang Xue nodded.

“Tang continued, “Then when you have the authority to manage the CEN base, can you arrange for your cousin to go in?” ”

“”Yes.”Not to mention Bai Yun, she could even arrange for her seven aunts and eight aunts to go in. ”

“”That’s Great!”Tang said excitedly, “I’ll contact Yun Yun right away. She’ll definitely be overjoyed!” ”

There were only a few days left before the aircraft carrier took off. They had to get Bai Yun to come over early to watch the show.

“After saying that, Tang continued, “Oh right, Xiaoxue, can you arrange for Yun Yun to visit the site?” ”

“Last time at the base, Ye Zhuo had offended Bai Yun badly, causing him to suffer such humiliation. This time, Bai Yun wanted to personally watch ye Zhuo fall from the altar and become a despised dog! ”

“”Sure,”Tang Xue continued, “If you want to go to the venue, I can arrange for you to go with me.” ”

“Really?”Mother Tang was very excited.

Going to the venue to watch was definitely more exciting than watching a live broadcast!

Tang Xue nodded. “Of course it’s true!”

“”Then I want to go to the venue to watch too. I’ll tell Yunyun about this good news first!”After saying that, mother Tang jogged over to make a phone call. ”

“On the other end of the phone, Bai Yun was also very excited when she heard the news. ”

“”Aunt, did cousin really say that I should be the management team?” ”

“Ever since she was publicly humiliated by ye Zao at the Cen Base, Bai Yun swore that one day, she would seek revenge on ye Zao and return everything that she had experienced to ye Zao a hundredfold. ”

“Finally, she had waited until this day! ”

The wheel of fortune had turned.

“From now on, in the CEN base, she would be the leader. ”

She wanted ye Zao to serve her tea and water.

“As long as she imagined it, she would feel extremely happy! ”

“Bai Yun curled the corners of her lips, her eyes filled with pride. ”

“”Of course it’s true! would aunt lie to You?”Mother Tang continued, “Come over quickly! If there’s a chance, it’s best if your cousin can introduce you to Mr. William.” ”

“Who’s Mr. William?”Bai Yun asked.

“Mother Tang said, “Mr. William is from C Nation. You’ll know when you get here!” ”

“”Okay, thank you, aunt! I’ll come over tomorrow!” ”

“Okay.”Mother Tang said a few more words to Bai Yun before hanging up.

Next door.

It was not easy for her to get off the morning shift. Tang Mi was very happy and ate two bowls of rice in a row.Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com
