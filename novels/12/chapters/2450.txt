“Looks like there’s nothing more to talk about between us.”Song Shiyu turned around and left.

“Chen Siyao stood up as well and shouted at song Shiyu’s back, “Shiyu!” ”

Song Shiyu didn’t hear Chen Siyao’s shout and walked forward without looking back.

He didn’t even look back at Chen Siyao until song Shiyu’s back disappeared in front of him.

“Chen Siyao was close to despair, tears falling like rain. ”

“At this moment, she finally understood those who died for love. ”

But she couldn’t die.

She had to live.

She had to love song Shiyu well.

Only by living well could she see a miracle happen.

What if...

“What if one day, song Shiyu suddenly saw her good and fell in love with her? ”

Yes.

There would definitely be such a day.

“Chen Siyao wiped away her tears, and the expression in her eyes slowly became more determined. ”

“Just then, Chen Siyao seemed to have thought of something. She picked up her phone and sent a message. ”

“”Little Tian, if you’re free, let’s meet.” ”

Little Tian was song Shiyu’s special assistant.

“Chen Siyao wanted to know more about song Shiyu, so she just asked Little Tian. ”

“Under normal circumstances, Xiao Tian would tell her everything. ”

“Xiao Tian happened to be resting today. After receiving Chen Siyao’s message, he immediately replied, “Sister Yao, I’m Free Anytime.” ”

Chen Siyao sent the address of the meeting.

She couldn’t wait to get to know the person song Shiyu had set his heart on.

“She was very envious, but she wasn’t jealous. ”

...

By the sea.

At night.

The scenery by the sea was very beautiful.

“In his twilight years, he had someone send over a barbecue grill and barbecue equipment. Then, he turned to look at CEN Shaoqing and said, “Zixu, I’ve just dug up a barbecue master who lives nearby. I’ll call him over immediately.” ”

“Find a master to Grill for us?”Ye Zhuo continued.

Yu twilight years nodded. “Yes.”

“Cen Shaoqing immediately understood what ye Zhuo meant. He twirled the Buddhist beads and continued, “Coming to the beach to grill it will definitely make it taste better if we do it ourselves. What kind of Chef is that?” ”

“AH? ? ?”Yu sunset looked at Cen Shaoqing in confusion. “You mean we do it ourselves?”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Xian ‘er, who was beside him, said excitedly, “Alright, Alright! I love DIY the most!” ”

“In desperation, Yu Shaoqing had no choice but to compromise. ”

He did not understand when Cen Shaoqing had become obsessed with doing things himself?

“After knowing Cen Shaoqing for so many years, Yu Shaoqing had never seen Cen Shaoqing do things himself. ” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

It was too unbelievable.

“Today’s waves of disbelief came one after another, and Yu Shaoqing felt a little dizzy. ”

“After all the barbecue ingredients were served, the few of them began to prepare for the barbecue. ”

Yu Luonian and Xian ‘er were a couple.

Cen Shaoqing was naturally a couple with ye Zhuo.

“Very soon, the aroma of the barbecue could be heard in the air. ”

This was the first time Yu Luonian knew that Cen Shaoqing knew how to barbecue.

“”Zixu, I didn’t realize that you were so secretive!”Yu Luonian looked at Cen Shaoqing and said. ”

Cen Shaoqing skillfully picked up a piece of chicken steak and began to roast it. “There are many things that you don’t know.”

Yu sunset looked at Ye Zhuo again.

She had thought that ye Zhuo would sit and wait for Cen Shaoqing to roast it for her to eat.

“After all, girls were very delicate, and Cen Shaoqing was willing to spoil her, so it was normal for her not to be willing to do it. ”

But she did not.

“Ye Zhuo had also been doing the barbecue. He did not say much. The sea breeze blew past, and a strand of hair fell from her ear, brushing past her picturesque facial features. It suddenly reminded Yu sunset of the scene she saw at the dashboard today. ”

Yu sunset immediately looked away and took a bite of the chicken wing that Xian ‘er handed him.

“Is it good?”Xian ‘er asked.

“”It’s very good,”yu sunset answered. ”

“Xian ‘er smiled and said, “Of course. How can it not be good when I cook it with my own hands?” ”

Yu sunset did not know how to taste the food.

He did not know what was wrong with him.

He just suddenly felt that the kebab in his hand did not smell good anymore.
