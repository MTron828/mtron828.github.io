“”About two to three days,”Liu Chao said. ”

Bai Mo nodded. “Then I’ll wait for you at home.”

“Liu Chao looked at Bai mo. “During the time I’m not at home, if you dare to do anything to my son, Bai Mo, when I come back, I’ll definitely not let you off!” ”

“”Don’t worry,”Bai Mo continued, “I’m already married to you now. I Can’t go back to the s galaxy either. I’ll give birth to this child properly.” ”

“Seeing Bai Mo like this, Liu Chao was slightly relieved. ”

“Bai Mo had already fallen to such a state, so it was unlikely that she would be able to find any flowers. ”

The next day.

“As expected, Liu Chao left the house early in the morning. ”

“Bai Mo watched Liu Chao’s car disappear outside the door. Then, she tidied up a little and prepared to leave as well. ”

There was only one person who could save Bai Mo now.

And that was Bai Jingshu.

“Bai Mo had been guarding Bai Jingshu’s daily route since early in the morning. When she saw Bai Jingshu’s figure, she immediately ran over. “Sis!” ”

Bai Jingshu turned around and saw Bai Mo..

“Bai Mo immediately knelt down. “SIS, I was wrong! I really know that I was wrong. Please forgive me!” ”

She endured for a moment before everything calmed down.

“Having reached this point in her life, Bai Mo could only lower her head. ”

“Bai Jingshu looked at Bai mo. “Bai Mo, we have nothing to do with each other anymore.” ”

“”No, SIS, you’re my sister. We’re blood-related sisters,”Bai Mo cried. “SIS, I was wrong before. I shouldn’t have been wishful thinking, and I shouldn’t have been daydreaming. Everyone makes mistakes. SIS, please give me a chance to change! “I don’t want to stay here anymore. Do you know what kind of days I’ve been living these past few days? “I beg you to bring me back to the s galaxy? “I miss my parents, and I Miss Grandpa Too!” ”

Grandpa.

Bai Jingshu’s expression changed at the mention of Old Master Bai.

“Bai Mo noticed this detail and knew that she had her finger on Bai Jingshu’s sensitive spot, “Sister, Grandpa is already so old. You definitely don’t want him to worry, right? Just let me go back and Tell Grandpa that I’m Safe!” ”

Bai Jingshu looked at Bai Mo with an indescribable expression in her eyes.

She was a little unsure of what she should do.

“Just as Bai Jingshu was hesitating, ye Zao’s words suddenly rang in her ears. ”

“Bai Jingshu immediately calmed down and continued, “Bai Mo, some things happen just because they happen. It’s not like you can pretend that they didn’t happen just because you want to avoid them.” ”

“”Sis! I’m begging you!”Bai Mo cried very sadly and continued, “Liu Chao isn’t human at all. He beats me every day... you can’t just leave me to die...” ”

“Bai Jingshu lowered her head and looked at Bai mo. “If I knew this would happen, why did I do it in the first place?” ”

“If Bai Mo didn’t have the intention to kill her back then, how would he have ended up in this state? ”

“After saying this, Bai Jingshu turned around and left. ”

“This time, Bai Jingshu left with absolute determination. She did not hesitate at all. ”

“Sis! Don’t go!”Bai Mo screamed at the top of his lungs.

Bai Jingshu could not leave. What would she do if Bai Jingshu left?

“Sis!”

“Sis!”

“Bai Mo immediately chased after her and grabbed Bai Jingshu’s hand. “SIS, I’m begging you. As long as you can bring me back, I’ll do anything you want. SIS, it was all my fault in the past. I was wrong. Please forgive me...” ”

“She had thought that Bai Jingshu would forgive her this time, but to her surprise, Bai Jingshu actually shook her hand away. ”

“Bai Mo looked at Bai Jingshu’s determined back, her eyes filled with regret. ”

She began to regret her actions back then.

She should not have killed Bai Jingshu.

“But there was no shortage of medicine in this world, only regret. ”

What should she do?

What should she do now?

Was she really going to stay on Earth and live with Liu Chao for the rest of her life and give him a child?

No!

She couldn’t do it!

She really couldn’t do it!

“She was going to stay on Earth and give Liu Chao a child. From then on, she would become a lowly earthling. This was worse than killing her. ”

Bai Mo knelt on the ground and cried loudly.

“After crying for a long time, Bai Mo came to the overpass where people came and went. She wanted to jump off the overpass, but when she looked down from the bridge, a sense of panic suddenly ignited in her heart. ”

No.

She couldn’t jump.

She was the favored daughter of the s galaxy. How could she die on earth?

She wanted to go back!

“No matter what price she had to pay, she wanted to go back. Even if she had to die, she wanted to die on Earth. ”

“Thinking of this, Bai Mo wiped her tears and walked back. ”

“Ever since she came to the resort island, Ye Zhuo had been shopping, eating, eating, and shopping every day. ”

“Cen Shaoqing was responsible for following behind her, paying for her, and taking her things. ”

“Where are we going to play tomorrow?”Ye Zhuo lay on the bed and looked at Cen Shaoqing.

“Cen Shaoqing took out the itinerary and continued, “We’re going to flower and Bird Island Tomorrow.” ”

“Flower and Bird Island?”Ye Zhuo’s beautiful eyes narrowed. “Is it fun?”

“”I saw that the score on the internet was very good. It’s a must-go place for couples,”Cen Shaoqing replied. ”

“Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Alright, then we’ll go and take a look tomorrow.” ”

“After saying that, ye Zhuo continued, “Let’s buy tickets and go by boat tomorrow, Shall We?” ”

“These few days, their trips would either be by helicopter or by private car. Ye Zhuo wanted to experience the feeling of queuing up to buy tickets. ”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “I’ll get someone to book the tickets.”

Ye Zhuo immediately stopped Cen Shaoqing. “We’ll buy the tickets on the spot tomorrow.”

“Hearing this, Cen Shaoqing subconsciously frowned, but in the end, he did not say anything. ”

As long as the leader was happy.
