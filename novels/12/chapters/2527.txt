“Not long after, doctor Wang brought Weiwei to the examination room. ”

“The examination for malaria required three tests, so it was not too troublesome. ”

“Weiwei looked at doctor Wang and asked, “Doctor Wang, is there a new problem with my body?” ”

“Doctor Wang said, “We will only know after the results of the examination are out.” ”

“Vivi hesitated for a moment before asking, “Is it serious?” ”

“Doctor Wang looked at Vivi. “To be honest, your situation isn’t very optimistic.” ”

He was different from ye Zao.

“Doctor Wang felt that as a doctor, he should tell the patient the truth and not hide it from the patient. ”

Ye Zao’s intentions were good.

“However, the patient’s mental endurance was inferior to that of an ordinary person. Under great sorrow and joy, the patient would definitely not be able to withstand it. ”

“Therefore, he chose to tell Weiwei the truth. ”

“Hearing this, the expression on Weiwei’s face disappeared in an instant. ”

“”But, but sister ye said that I’ll be able to recover soon!”Weiwei continued. ”

“Doctor Wang pushed up his spectacles, “Weiwei, your situation is indeed not optimistic. The reason why Miss Ye said this was because she was afraid that you wouldn’t be able to withstand it. However, the illness can not be hidden. One day, you will also know the true situation.” ”

“Weiwei’s face became paler and paler. She could barely stand. Fortunately, there was a wall behind her. Otherwise, she would have fallen to the ground. ”

She had already seen hope. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“However, life had disappointed her again! ”

What should she do?

What should she do now?

The strength in Weiwei’s body seemed to have been sucked away in an instant.

Doctor Wang reached out to support Weiwei. “You have to be strong.”

“Vivi turned to look at Doctor Wang. “Then, do I, do I still have any hope of surviving?” ”

“Doctor Wang frowned slightly. “The hope is very small, but it’s better than nothing.” ”

“Okay.”Vivi nodded. “I understand.”

“Doctor Wang continued, “Vivi, don’t be negative. Maintain the optimistic attitude from before. Although our hospital is not confident that we can cure your illness, there is a cause and effect. I believe that we will definitely find a way to cure it one day.” ”

“Okay.”

“Seeing that Weiwei’s expression was getting worse, doctor Wang continued, “Weiwei, I only told you the most serious result. Let’s wait for the test results to come out.” ”

“Okay.”Weiwei nodded.

“Half an hour later, the test results came out. ”

Doctor Wang immediately took the report and looked at it carefully.

The results were as he expected.

Vivi’s results did not match up with malaria.

It was not malaria!

“Vivi walked forward. “Doctor Wang, how is it?” ”

Doctor Wang shook his head with a defeated expression.

“He did not say a word, but Vivi had already seen the results from his expression. ”

“After a moment, doctor Wang continued, “Vivi, don’t worry. Don’t worry. I will definitely find a way to save you.” ”

“Weiwei smiled and said, “I believe in miracles more than anyone else.” ”

“However, if miracles appeared so easily, then miracles would not be called miracles. ”

“Seeing her like this, doctor Wang heaved a sigh of relief. “Weiwei, it’s good that you can think like this. Let’s go, I’ll send you back to the ward to rest first.” ”

“Okay.”Weiwei nodded and followed doctor Wang’s footsteps.

“However, compared to when she came, her footsteps were much less lively. ”

She was like a puppet without a soul.

Doctor Wang sent Weiwei to the ward and told her to rest well and not think too much.

“Weiwei smiled and said, “I know, doctor Wang.” ”

Doctor Wang closed the door.

Weiwei leaned against the wall and cried out loud.

She could not bear to leave.

She could not bear to leave this beautiful world.

“A person never wanted to live, until they started to miss the world, and then they were sentenced to death. ”

This feeling was very uncomfortable.

She was very grateful to ye Zao.

“At the same time, she also hated ye Zao. ”

“Because ye Zao gave her hope, and ye Zao crushed her hope with his own hands. ”

She had already become indifferent to life and death.

“Vivi just sat on the ground, hugging her knees with both hands, burying her head deep in her knees. ”

The air was filled with suppressed sounds.

It was extremely cramped.

...

Doctor Wang took the examination report and went to look for director Han.

Director Han took the report and looked at Doctor Wang. “What’s wrong with Old Wang?”

“Doctor Wang said, “This is Wei Wei’s examination report.” ”

Director Han looked down at the report again and frowned slightly.

“Doctor Wang continued, “Director, I just gave Wei Wei a checkup. She doesn’t have malaria at all. Since she doesn’t have malaria, she naturally can’t be treated according to the treatment plan for malaria.” ”
