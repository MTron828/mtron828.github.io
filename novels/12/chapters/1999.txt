Translator: 549690339

The door lock had been unlocked.

Could it be that Qiu Di had returned?

She thought about what was going to happen next.

Yi Ling shrunk her body and tried her best to control herself so that she would not tremble.

“Then, a hand gently patted its small head. ”

“It patted very gently. Initially, there should not have been any problems, but Yi Ling was now injured. How could she withstand such a Pat? She immediately felt dizzy. ”

“Qiu Di, this Bad Woman! ”

What on earth did she want to do?

“”Not dead! The burning is not dead! She will definitely come to save me!”Yi Ling used all her strength and turned around to glare at the person who patted it. “You Bad Woman, you will definitely get your retribution!” ”

Seeing the face of the person who came.

Yi Ling was stunned.

“Because the person standing behind it was not Qiu Di, nor ye Han, nor anyone from the Qiu family. ”

Who Was She?

“This was a very unfamiliar face. Her skin was slightly dark, her face was round, and freckles grew on both sides of her nose. ”

“Her appearance was very ordinary, the kind that could not be found even among the crowd. ”

“Doggie.”

“The person spoke softly, her tone clear and shallow. ”

“Yi Ling felt that this voice was very familiar. Looking at the person again, she discovered that her pair of eyes were incomparably clear, like the brightest star among the thousands of stars, able to point out people who were lost in the wilderness at any time. ”

“Through this pair of eyes, Yi Ling seemed to see another person in an instant. ”

It was ye Zhuo.

“After realizing this problem, its eyes instantly turned red. ”

Its nose also became extremely sour.

It felt like a child who had been wronged had suddenly seen its parent.

“With its parent here, there would be someone who could back it up. ” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“In this world, other than ye Zhuo, there was no other person who could back it up. ”

Wow!

“The next second, Yi Ling cried bitterly and said aggrievedly, “Big Zao! Big Zao!” ”

That’s right.

This was ye Zao.

“Although her appearance had changed, she would always remember her eyes. ”

“Back then, when Yi Ling opened her eyes for the first time, she saw a pair of eyes like this. ”

“Ye Zao reached out both hands and touched Yi Ling’s head. “Doggie, I’m here to bring you home.” ”

“It was a very simple sentence, but it made Yi Ling’s emotions collapse once again. ”

Home.

How many days had it been.

It had finally heard this sentence.

“”Big Zhuozhuo, you’re finally here!”Yi Ling cried so hard that it was tearing her heart and lungs out. She wished that she could tell ye Zhuozhou all the grievances she had suffered these past few days. ”

“Don’t cry.”Ye Zhuoshuang wiped away Yi Ling’s tears. “I’ll avenge you!”

“Yi Ling, who was originally twenty-five kilograms and as fat as a ball, was now covered in long white fur. She weighed less than ten kilograms, and one of her wings was broken. ”

Her entire body was covered in wounds and bloodstains.

Just looking at her made people shudder. No one knew what kind of inhuman torture she had gone through these days.

“Upon hearing ye Zao’s words, Yi Ling immediately forgot all the pain. She jumped up and hugged her neck. She cried, “Da Zao Zao, I Knew You Weren’t dead! I knew you would definitely come back to avenge me!” ”

They all said that ye Zao was already dead.

Only it knew.

Ye Zao was not dead.

How could she die when ye Zao was such a powerful person?

“Ye Zao patted Yi Ling’s little head. His eyes were cold. “Sorry, I’m late.” ”

It was her incompetence that had failed to protect the people around her.

“Yi Ling sniffled. “It’s okay, da Zao Zao. As long as you’re okay, it doesn’t matter what happens to me.” ”

“A moment later, ye Zao continued, “Who brought you here? The Qiu Family?” ”

“It was clearly a very faint voice, but it carried a chill that made people tremble in fear. ”

The Qiu family was originally just a very ordinary family.

“Ye Zao didn’t even know that there were people like Qiu Di and Qiu Chang Zhen. She never expected that in just a few months, there would be such a huge change in changyue. ”

“”It’s Qiu Di and Ye Han!”Yi Ling continued, “Zao Zao, what exactly happened? Why did they say that you died? Also, Ye Han betrayed us!” ”

Ye Zhuo frowned slightly.

Ye Han betrayed them?

How could it be?

“Ye Zhuo could accept everyone’s betrayal, but he could not accept ye Han’s betrayal. ”

“Just as ye Zhuo was about to ask something, Yi Ling blacked out and fainted. ”

“Ye Zhuo immediately reached out to catch it, then took out a pill from his pocket and fed it to Yi Ling. ”

“After a pill was fed, the wounds on the spirit disappeared at a speed visible to the naked eye. ”
