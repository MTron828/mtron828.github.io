Translator: 549690339

“”Actually, this matter has a lot to do with the old man. If the old man had tried to persuade her, she wouldn’t have ended up like this.” ”

“Just wait and see. There will be a day when she regrets it!”

“The two sisters of the Bai family are interesting. Both of them have fallen in love with the same man!”

“”What do you mean by both of them have fallen in love with the same man? Bai Mo didn’t fall in love with Lin Ze from the beginning to the end. I heard that when Mr. Ye introduced ye Han to Bai Mo, Bai Mo rejected Lin Ze!” ”

“”In that case, Bai Mo is still smart and didn’t fall for the Scumbag’s trick.” ”

“...”

“The discussion rose and fell. Although it was deliberately suppressed, it could still be heard. ”

“These voices entered elder Bai’s ears from every angle. Elder Bai didn’t get angry and just stood there, looking at Bai Jingshu who was sitting in front of the bed. His eyes were slightly red. ”

Time seemed to have returned to 20 years ago in an instant.

“At that time, Bai Jingshu was still a palm-sized baby. ”

Tiny.

“In the blink of an eye, that tiny baby from back then had already put on a pure white wedding dress and was about to enter the hall of marriage. ”

“For a moment, old master Bai felt a myriad of emotions. ”

Today was Bai Jingshu’s wedding day.

“She clearly had parents, but she was like an orphan without parents. Even on her wedding day, her parents didn’t come to send her off. ”

“This child had never enjoyed the love of a father and mother since she was young. She was also very stubborn. If he had not protected her, she might have died a long time ago. ”

“”Jingshu,”Old Master Bai continued. ”

“Grandfather.”Bai Jingshu raised her head to look at Old Master Bai.

“Old Master Bai said, “From now on, you will be someone else’s wife, daughter-in-law, and also the child’s mother. Your life will no longer be a single role. Grandfather Wishes You Happiness!” ”

“”Thank you, grandfather.”Bai Jingshu’s eyes were also slightly red. ”

The person she was most worried about was old master Bai.

“All these years, she had been traveling around the world, researching ancient cultures, and had neglected old master Bai. However, Old Master Bai’s health was not very good. ”

“”Silly child.”Old Master Bai placed his hand on Bai Jingshu’s head. “When you arrive at the in-laws’house, remember to be filial to them. You must not let them find fault with our family...” ”

His mother should be the one to say these words to his daughter.

“Now, it could only be said by his grandfather. ”

“I know.”Bai Jingshu nodded.

Bai Sanfeng looked at the grandfather and granddaughter and shook her head helplessly.

She didn’t understand Old Master Bai’s decision.

“There were all kinds of medicine in this world, but there was no medicine for regret. ”

“Before long, hurried footsteps came from outside the door. ”

“Old Master! Old Master!”

Old Master Bai instantly reacted. He wiped his tears and looked up. “What’s Wrong?”

“”Someone from the, the Shangguan family came!”The Butler looked at Old Master Bai and said. ”

Someone from the Shangguan family came?

This sentence stunned old master Bai.

Which Shangguan Family?

The guests who were watching the show were also stunned.

“In the s galaxy, there were no high-ranking nobles with the surname Shangguan. ”

The only one who could be called a noble was the Shangguan family of the F galaxy.

But would the Shangguan family of the F galaxy come to congratulate the Bai Family?

It was impossible!

“The Shangguan family was the number one family in the F galaxy, and people would flock to them. How could such a family condescend to congratulate the Bai family. ”

It was simply a fantasy.

“After a moment, master bai reacted, “Which Shangguan Family?” ”

“The butler wiped the sweat off his face and replied, “It’s the Shangguan family from the F Galaxy.” ”

The Shangguan family from the F Galaxy?

“This sentence was like a deep-water bomb, causing everyone to be at a loss. ”

The Shangguan family from the F Galaxy would come to congratulate the Bai Family?

Congratulate Bai Jingshu on marrying an Earthling?

How could this be possible!

It was simply impossible!

“Old Master Bai also felt that it was somewhat impossible. He looked up at the butler and said, “Quickly bring me to take a look.” ”

The housekeeper nodded. “She’s in the front hall. Old Lady Shangguan came personally.”

Old Lady Shangguan came personally?

That was even more impossible!

Who Was Old Lady Shangguan?

“She had lived in seclusion for many years, and the Bai family had nothing to do with her. How could she have come personally! ”

“Old Master Bai followed the Shangguan family’s footsteps, feeling a little puzzled and curious. ”

Who exactly was this old Lady Shangguan?

“It wasn’t just old master Bai who was curious, but also the guests who were watching the show. ” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Everyone followed Old Master Bai to the front hall.

“When they arrived at the front hall, they saw a white-haired, spirited old lady sitting on the sofa. ”
