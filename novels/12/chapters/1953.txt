Translator: 549690339

“The next second, the door was pushed open. ”

“Miss Ye.”

“Tang Mi.”Ye Zao looked up. “Did Something Happen?”

“Tang Mi’s expression didn’t look too good. “Miss Ye, there are surveillance cameras monitoring us in the sky above Mars.” ”

“Don’t worry.”Ye Zao’s expression softened. “The entire base has turned on the shielding mode. They can’t see anything.”

“From the outside, Mars was still the same Mars. ”

“Although the resources ye Zao had at present were limited, her ability was still there. ”

She had many ways to shield everything.

“Tang mi continued, “I understand all these principles, but the others...” ”

“At this point, Tang mi paused. ”

“Ever since the surveillance cameras appeared in the sky above Mars, some people on the base couldn’t sit still anymore! ”

They were all clamoring to return to Earth.

“How many people are going back so far?”Ye Zhuo saw through Tang Mi’s unfinished words with a glance.

As expected of Miss Ye!

She could even guess this.

“Tang Mi was full of admiration for ye Zhuo and continued, “There are a total of 13 people.” ”

“”They are all high-ranking officials,”Tang Mi added. ”

“Ye Zhuo frowned slightly. “The people below aren’t in chaos yet! They are in chaos first! They want to go back, right?” ”

“Yes.”Tang mi nodded.

“”Send them back.”Ye Zhuo continued, “Let them think it over carefully. After they go back this time, it will be impossible for them to come back in the future! “Then, tell those companions who stayed behind that I, Ye Zhuo, will stay on Mars with them and advance and retreat together!” ”

“Upon hearing this, Tang Mi was extremely excited. She nodded and said, “Okay!” ”

“Ever since the monitor appeared in the sky above Mars, Tang Mi had been extremely nervous. ”

“At this moment, she was not nervous at all. ”

What was so scary about the monitor!

What was so scary about aliens?

“As long as ye Zhuo was around, all these problems were not a problem. ”

Tang mi immediately went over to pass on ye Zhuo’s words to everyone.

“After hearing these words, everyone was also very excited. ”

Those higher-ups who were clamoring to go back did not go back either. They all expressed that they wanted to advance and retreat together with ye Zao!

“Ye Zao was the highest leader. If she was not afraid, what were they afraid of? ”

On the other side.

He ziteng’s apartment.

“More than a month had passed, and Xu Yao’s hand had already recovered to its original state. ”

“She originally wanted to move out of He Ziteng’s apartment, but was stopped by HE ziteng. ”

Xu Yao played along and stayed in the apartment.

“However, he ziteng was very busy during this period of time and often couldn’t go home to rest. ”

He would come back occasionally and leave after a few days.

“Because of this, he ziteng felt very guilty. He looked at Xu Yao and said, “Yaoyao, if I’m not home in the future, you can call doctor mi to accompany you.” ”

“Xu Yao was a little speechless and said, “I’m not familiar with him. Besides, it’s just a man and a woman. Do you think it’s okay?” ”

“Xu Yao looked calm on the surface, but she was a little flustered in her heart. ”

Why did he ziteng bring up Mi Chen all of a sudden?

Could it be... UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

He had discovered something?

“He ziteng put his arm around Xu Yao’s shoulder and continued, “It’s okay. Doctor Mi is not the kind of person you think he is. He saved my mother before. Besides, didn’t he come every day to apply medicine on you?” ”

“Judging from his tone, he did not seem to have noticed anything. ”

“Xu Yao heaved a sigh of relief and continued, “It has only been a short while since he applied the medicine. I’ve only spoken to him less than ten sentences.” ”

“He ziteng smiled and said, “Dr. Mi is a very good person. You can try to get along with him.”It was not the past anymore. Girls who had boyfriends could not even make friends with other men. ”

He ziteng did not want Xu Yao to be closed off from society after they became boyfriend and girlfriend.

“”No need.”Xu Yao hugged he ziteng’s arm. In her heart, she scolded he ziteng for being an idiot. However, she smiled and said, “No need. I have you.” ”

He ziteng patted Xu Yao’s hand.

“In order for Xu Yao to have more friends, he ziteng invited Mi Chen to his house that night. ”

“At the dinner table, Mi Chen poured he ziteng a lot of wine. ”

“Not long after, he ziteng was drunk and fell asleep on the table. ”

Mi Chen and Xu Yao looked at each other and saw the meaning in each other’s eyes.

“Xu Yao patted he ziteng on the shoulder. “Ziteng, ziteng!” ”

He Ziteng didn’t have any reaction.

“Mr. He.”Mi Chen also patted he ziteng.

He ziteng still didn’t react.

“”Miss Xu, I’m going to the washroom.”As she spoke, Mi Chen used her foot to kick Xu Yao. ”

Xu Yao understood and smiled. “You go ahead.”

Mi Chen stood up from her chair and walked towards the washroom.

“A moment later, Xu Yao stood up as well. ”

“Just as she reached the door of the washroom, someone grabbed her wrist and pulled her into the washroom. The next second, she was kissed. ”

Xu Yao pushed Mi Chen away. “Are you crazy? What if he ziteng suddenly wakes up?”

“Mi Chen smiled. “Don’t worry, he won’t wake up for the time being.” ”

“Xu Yao narrowed her eyes and instantly understood. She continued, “You drugged his wine?” ”

“Yes.”Mi Chen nodded.

Xu Yao was very surprised.

She had been on the table from head to toe and did not notice mi Chen’s abnormality at all.

How did Mi Chen Do It?

“Mi Chen seemed to have noticed Xu Yao’s confusion and continued, “When I was toasting him.” ”

Xu Yao gulped. She once again felt that Mi Chen was very powerful!

The two of them hung out in the bathroom for a while before leaving.

He ziteng still maintained the same appearance as the two of them left and lay on the table.

“Seeing that he ziteng had not woken up, Xu Yao became more daring. He ziteng actually dared to make out with Mi Chen in front of him. ”

“By the time he ziteng woke up, it was already the morning of the next day. ”

He ziteng pressed his temples and felt extremely uncomfortable.

“At that moment, Xu Yao came over with a bowl of hangover soup. “You don’t feel good when you have a hangover, do you? I told you not to drink so much. You must drink so much! Come, drink the hangover soup!” ”

“He ziteng took the hangover soup and drank it all in one go. He felt much better and continued, “Was Mi Chen Drunk Last Night?” ”

“Xu Yao said, “I don’t know how much better Dr. Mi’s alcohol tolerance is than yours! How could he be drunk?” ”

There was nothing unusual on her face. It was as if the person who was intimate with Mi Chen in front of he ziteng was not her.

“He ziteng had always trusted Xu Yao. Naturally, he would not suspect anything between her and Mi Chen. ”

“In his opinion, anyone in this world would betray him except Xu Yao. ”

“In this world, no one loved Xu Yao more than him. ”

“Similarly, no one loved him more than Xu Yao! ”

“After saying that, Xu Yao continued, “Don’t drink so much next time. Do you know how much you drank last night? Not only did you vomit all over me, you even spouted nonsense! You made a fool out of Doctor Mi!” ”

“Vomit all over you?”He ziteng asked.

Xu Yao nodded. “What do you think!”

“He ziteng continued, “I’m sorry, Yaoyao. I don’t even remember. If I had been sober, I definitely wouldn’t have vomited on you!” ”

“Xu Yao smiled and said, “Alright, Alright. I was just saying. Why are you apologizing! I just wanted to say that drinking is harmful to the body and drinking is enjoyable. Try not to drink too much.” ”

“Okay.”He ziteng nodded.

“Seeing he ziteng like this, Xu Yao was relieved. She originally thought that he ziteng would have discovered something last night. After all, she and Mi Chen had quite a good time in the end. ”

“Now it seemed that he ziteng, this idiot, didn’t discover anything at all! ”

“After all, he couldn’t even remember whether he vomited or not. ”

On the other side.

At the Xu Residence.

“In the dining room, father he and mother he were eating at the dining table. ”

“In Norda’s dining room, there were only the He family’s parents. It looked a little deserted. ”

“Thinking that he ziteng hadn’t returned home for almost a month, father he said, “Xunfang, isn’t your decision a little too hasty?” ”

“What decision?”Mother he raised her head.

“Father he continued, “It’s about ziteng and Xu Yao.” ”

“How is it hasty?”Mother he asked back.

“Father he said, “I feel that you shouldn’t have agreed to ziteng from the start and let him talk to Xu Yao for three years. What if after three years, they are still the same as they are now? What would you do?” ”

He couldn’t really promise he ziteng and Xu Yao to get married!

“Mother he took a bite of celery. “Time will tell. Their relationship will definitely not last for three years. I know Ziteng’s character too well. If we forcefully break them up, it will backfire.” ”

It was precisely because she knew he ziteng that mother he made this decision.

Father he frowned. “What if they survive for three years?”

“Then let them get married!”Mother he said.

“Father he said incredulously, “Are you serious?” ”

“Mother he smiled and said, “Do you think I’m Joking?” ”

Three years was neither long nor short.

“Father he drank a mouthful of soup and said, “Alright, I’ll listen to you.” ”
