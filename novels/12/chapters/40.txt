Chapter 41: Taking a Turn for the Better

The more Zhou Xiang thought about it, the more anxious she became.

If there was really something wrong with the medicine, then she would have become the murderer who had killed the old madam of the house.

If she had known earlier, she would not have let the old madam take the medicine last night.

What should she do now?

If something happened to the old madam, she would not be able to continue living anymore.

Zhou Xiang was so anxious that her eyes were red. She rushed upstairs and knocked on the door. “Mom! Mom! Are you inside?”

The door was locked from the inside. She knocked for a long time, but there was no response from inside.

Zhou Xiang did not have a key, so she had no choice but to get assistance from a few servants. She planned to use violence to break the door open.

Then, Zhou Xiang asked the butler to invite Doctor Lin over.

After all, she was one with experience in handling matters. Although she was very anxious, Zhou Xiang was still able to order everything in a calm and an orderly manner.

The door was very strongly built. The five servants spent a few minutes before the door was forced open.

Madam Cen was sleeping on the bed, her body covered by a thin blanket.

The room was very silent, and there was no telling if Madam Cen was still breathing.

Zhou Xiang was so worried that her heart almost stopped beating. “… Mom?”

When Madam Cen did not respond, Zhou Xiang raised her voice and called out again, “Mom?”

But Madam Cen still did not react.

Could it be…

Could Madam Cen have really…?

Zhou Xiang’s eyes immediately turned red. She rushed over and hugged Madam Cen. “Mom! Mom! What happened to you? Mom!”

Madam Cen was in a deep slumber when she was suddenly awakened by a burst of crying.

She thought that it was still the middle of the night.

Unexpectedly, when she opened her eyes, the sun was shining through the window. It seemed that she had not seen such bright sunlight for a long time.

It felt like she a blind person who suddenly gained vision and saw light for the very first time.

Madam Cen was stunned for a moment. Then, she looked at the crying Zhou Xiang with a blank expression. “Xiang Xiang, what’s wrong?”

Zhou Xiang widened her eyes and looked at Madam Cen. “Ah! Mom! You’re alright? I thought you…”

Madam Cen said in puzzlement, “What did you think was wrong with me?”

Zhou Xiang hugged Madam Cen excitedly. “Mom! You’re alright! You’re alright! I was scared to death just now!”

Seeing Zhou Xiang act this way, Madam Cen seemed to understand what was going on. She smiled and patted Zhou Xiang’s back. “Silly child, what could have happened to me?”

Zhou Xiang sniffed. “You usually get up at six in the morning, but it’s almost ten today! I knocked on the door outside, but you didn’t respond. I thought, thought…”

“It’s almost ten?” Madam Cen looked at Zhou Xiang in surprise.

Zhou Xiang nodded. “Yes.”

Madam Cen didn’t expect to sleep past nine. She only remembered that she fell fast asleep as soon as her head touched the pillow last night.

Twenty-three years!

She finally had a good night’s sleep! Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Madam Cen was so happy that her eyes turned red. “Twenty-three years, Xiang Xiang. I’ve waited for this day for twenty-three years! I can finally sleep well! I feel like my whole body is full of strength now. This is all thanks to Ye Zi!”

Zhou Xiang said in disbelief, “Mom! Did you really not have any trouble sleeping last night?”

Madam Cen’s illness was a chronic illness, and insomnia had become a common occurrence. Usually, even if she took sleeping pills, they would not have any effect. This was also the reason why she would usually get up early.

From the looks of it, that little girl by the name Ye Zi was indeed capable.

Zhou Xiang had originally intended to give the medicine to Madam Cen as a test. She did not expect the medicine to be so effective. Madam Cen had only taken it once and it had already improved her sleep.

“It’s true!” The old lady was so happy that she cried. “It’s been twenty-three years! I’ve really missed how it feels like to have a good sleep!” This elated feeling could only be understood by people who had just recovered from a serious illness.

Others simply could not empathize with it.

Zhou Xiang held Madam Cen’s hand. “Mom, you must be hungry from sleeping until now. What do you want to eat? I’ll order the kitchen to prepare it.”

Madam Cen thought for a moment. “I want to eat caviar and lobster noodles.”

Zhou Xiang nodded. “Then you should freshen up first. I’ll go to the kitchen and ask them to cook the noodles.”

“Okay.”

Half an hour later, Madam Cen came down from upstairs. Zhou Xiang had just arrived at the dining hall with a bowl of caviar and lobster noodles.

“Mom, the noodles are ready. Eat it while it’s hot.”

“Okay.” The old madam was in good spirits. Even her appetite had improved. In a short while, she had finished a bowl of noodles.

At this moment, the butler ran in while panting. “Madam, I went to look for Doctor Lin, but Doctor Lin refused to come. He said that unless Old Madam personally went to apologize to him…”

Doctor Lin arrogantly felt that he was the only one in Yunjing City who could cure Madam Cen, so he dared to say this. It seemed like the old woman had no other choice but to bow to him and beg for his help.

Madam Cen frowned slightly and asked, “Xiang Xiang, did you ask Old Zhang to look for Doctor Lin?”

Zhou Xiang nodded slightly and explained, “You didn’t answer no matter how many times I knocked on your door. I was worried that there was something wrong with the medicine last night, so I asked the butler to look for Doctor Lin.”

Madam Cen raised her head to look at the butler. “Old Zhang, do you think that Doctor Lin still wants me to apologize to him?”

The butler nodded awkwardly.

Madam Cen felt that the whole idea of it was so ridiculous that she laughed, “Everyone says that doctors are benevolent. I think that Doctor Lin’s heart must have been eaten by a dog! You want me to apologize to him? Dream on! He doesn’t deserve to be a doctor at all! My granddaughter-in-law’s medical skills are a thousand times better than his! Ten thousand times better!”

Zhou Xiang smiled and said, “Mom, it’s all thanks to Miss Ye Zi this time. Otherwise, I might really have to beg Doctor Lin! How about this, where does she live? Mom, I’ll go with you to thank her properly and also call Shaoqing to come along.”

Zhou Xiang was full of curiosity toward Ye Zhuo.

She was beautiful.

Her medical skills were not bad.

She couldn’t really be like a fairy, right?

Zhou Xiang really couldn’t imagine what a fairy who was even more beautiful than Song Chenyu looked like.

Madam Cen stood up and said, “You’re going to scare away my granddaughter-in-law! We should approach her step by step. We can’t rush it. We have to take things as they come. I’ll go find her myself. You don’t have to follow me.”

“But, if you go alone, won’t it show that our family is not being sincere?” Zhou Xiang said.

“No, no! Ye Zi is not that kind of person! Besides, I still have a little secret to tell Ye Zi! After I talk to her, I’ll invite her to our house. At that time, you can thank her however you want.”

Zhou Xiang nodded. “That works too, Mom. I’ll get the driver to send you.”

“Alright, I’ll go upstairs and change my clothes first.”

Soon after, Madam Cen changed and went downstairs. She was wearing the same old tattered clothes.

Zhou Xiang asked curiously, “Mom, why did you change into this set of clothes again?”

Madam Cen gave a mysterious smile. “It’s a secret.”

…

On the other hand, Doctor Lin had been waiting for a long time, but Butler Zhang had not come back.

What was going on?

Could it be that the old woman from the Cen family had… died?

At that thought, Doctor Lin’s eyebrows flared up.

If she had really died, what would he do?

Although the Cen family had just moved to the Yunjing Province, they much more generous than the other wealthy families.

He was still hoping to cure Madam Cen’s illness and make a small fortune!

Doctor Lin hurriedly called the butler.

He did not expect the butler’s reply to make him feel as if someone had poured a bucket of cold water on him. It was the kind of cold water that drenched one from head to toe.

Not only was the Cen family’s old madam fine, her condition had actually improved.

Improved?

Without his treatment, how could Madam Cen’s illness have improved?

How could there be any other doctor in the Yunjing Province who was even better than him?
