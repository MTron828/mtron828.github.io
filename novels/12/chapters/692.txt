“After saying this, old Mrs. Cen continued, “I’m going out to buy New Year’s goods today. Do you want to go with me?” ”

Although the Cen family had a butler.

“When it came to buying New Year’s goods, Old Mrs. Cen had to do it herself every year. ”

Cen Shaoqing drank a mouthful of milk. “I have a meeting this morning.”

“You’re not free?”Old Mrs. Cen narrowed her eyes.

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Old Mrs. Cen sighed and continued, “That’s such a pity! I’ve already made an appointment with Yezi to let you work as a porter for the two girls. Looks like we can only find someone else now.” ”

Ye Zhuo was going too?

Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted slightly and he immediately changed his words. “That meeting isn’t very important. You can postpone it until tomorrow.”

Old Mrs. Cen glanced at CEN Shaoqing with a calculating look in her eyes.

Heh.

Fighting with her!

Don’t you know that the older the wiser?

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “By the way, did you take a good look at the rules I gave you last time to pursue your wife?” ”

“I did.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“In order to avoid taking detours on his way to pursue his wife, he spent two days and three nights studying all the books that old Mrs. Cen gave him. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen nodded in satisfaction. “Not bad, not bad! This is more like my Bai Tang’s eldest grandson!” ”

“After saying that, old MRS. CEN continued, “Oh right, you must never learn from that CEO who dug out his heart and kidneys! That is your negative example!” ”

Old Mrs. Cen had already repeated this sentence more than ten times in front of Cen Shaoqing. Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “I know.”

“”Eldest grandson, it’s not that I’m bragging, but you’re getting better and better!”Old Mrs. Cen said with a proud face, “This is all thanks to my teaching Sun Youfang! If it weren’t for me, the Invincible and good grandmother of the universe, you would still be a Bachelor!” ”

“”Look at how beautiful, how outstanding, how perfect leaf is! Look at yourself again. Other than this face, how can you be worthy of leaf!” ”

Ye Zao was the best in the universe in Old Lady Cen’s heart.

No one could compare to ye Zao!

“If anyone dared to say anything bad about ye Zao, she would be angry with them. ”

“Cen Shaoqing, who was scolded,”...”for the umpteenth time, he wondered if he was really his grandson. ”

“After breakfast, Cen Shaoqing drove Old Lady Cen to the Lin residence to pick up ye Zao. ”

“He did not know if he had made an appointment with Old Lady Cen, but ye Zao was also wearing a wine-red coat today. ”

“From Afar, he could see that person walking through the snow. ”

“In the snow, the figure of that person was very obvious. It was as dazzling as a red plum blossom that had quietly opened in the snow after a cold night. ”

Old Mrs. Cen pushed the door open and got out of the car. She opened her hands to welcome ye Zao. “Yezi!”

Ye Zao jogged over and hugged Old Mrs. Cen. “Grandma Cen!”

“Cen Shaoqing, who had been ignored by the side, was speechless. He had never expected that old Mrs. Cen would become one of his competitors. ”

“After a moment, old Mrs. Cen held ye Zao’s hand and stood in front of Cen Shaoqing. “Fifth girl, what do you think of this grandparent-grandchild outfit that ye Zao and I are wearing? Doesn’t it look good?” ”

Fifth Girl.

“If ye Zao had not been by her side, old Mrs. Cen would not have called Cen Shaoqing by his nickname. ”

“Only then did Cen Shaoqing notice that not only was ye Zao’s coat wine red, even the style was exactly the same as Old Mrs. Cen’s. ”

These two clothes had their own merits.

“Ye Zao’s clothes were like red plum blossoms blooming in the snow. They were beautiful and eye-catching, and his body emitted a cold aura similar to that of winter. ”

And old Mrs. Cen’s clothes matched that sentence.

Lord grim with white hair and flowers. Time never defeats a beauty.

“Cen Shaoqing nodded his head slightly, “Beautiful.” ”

“Seeing the two wearing the same clothes, Cen Shaoqing suddenly remembered that in the novel, the male and female protagonist wore a couple’s outfit to show off their love. ”

Couple’s outfit...

“Thinking of this term, the corners of Cen Shaoqing’s mouth curled up into an unnoticeable arc. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen said with a proud expression, “Of course. How can I not look good when I personally chose it? Good-looking people like us are the most suitable for wine red!” ”

“After saying that, old Mrs. Cen continued, “Alright, let’s Get in the car! There are still a lot of things to buy!” ”

The three of them got in the car.

“Very soon, the car stopped in front of a large chain supermarket. ”

“In order to buy all the new year’s products, Old Mrs. Cen had written down all the things she wanted to buy on a note. As she walked, she read the note. ”

“Ye Zhuo held onto old Mrs. Cen’s arm. “Grandma Cen, which floor should we go to First?” ”
