But there were still many things missing.

“After saying that, ye Zhuo continued, “When I develop the space-time shuttle, I’ll definitely bring you to see our era.” ”

“”Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Leader, thank you.” ”

“Thank me for what?”Ye Zhuo looked back slightly.

“”Thank you for trusting me so much.”Cen Shaoqing looked at ye Zao and continued, “In the future, you are not allowed to tell these secrets to others. Aren’t you afraid that they will capture you and dissect you for experiments?”Just thinking about it.., cen Shaoqing was terrified. Just how much did this girl trust her to share this secret with him so seriously? ”

“”Yes.”Besides Cen Shaoqing, Ye Zhuo had never told anyone else. ”

Except for jokes.

“”By the way, leader, I have another question.”Cen Shaoqing continued to ask. ”

“What?”Ye Zhuo looked back slightly.

“Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads and continued, “Yes...”it was clearly something that came out of his mouth, but he did not know how to open his mouth. ”

“Why Are You So Sissy?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly.

“”You...”Cen Shaoqing raised his eyes to look at Ye Zhuo. His deep eyes could not see the bottom of it. “You, you...” ”

“What exactly do you want to say?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“”Nothing.”Cen Shaoqing’s words were on the tip of his tongue, but he suddenly changed his words. ”

“”Cen Shaoqing.”Ye Zhuo looked at Cen Shaoqing. “What’s wrong with you today? You’re stuttering. If you have something to say, say it all at once. I hate people like you who say half and leave half!” ”

“Cen Shaoqing touched his nose, “Leader, let’s make a deal in advance. If I say it out loud, you’re not allowed to be angry.” ”

“Ye zhuo nodded slightly, “Don’t worry, I’m not angry.” ”

“Seeing ye Zhuo say this, Cen Shaoqing heaved a sigh of relief. His thin lips parted slightly, “In the future world, did anyone pursue you?”Actually, what Cen Shaoqing wanted to ask more was, before him, did ye Zhuo experience any other feelings or relationships, however, he did not dare to. ”

“Do you know what Xiao Bai called me?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“Daddy?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“”Hey, Daddy’s son.”Ye Zhuo stood on his tiptoes lovingly and patted Cen Shaoqing’s hair. ”

Cen Shaoqing:”...”

“After a moment, CEN Shaoqing coughed lightly and said, “Leader, be more serious.” ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Don’t you know what little white calls me?” ”

“I don’t know.”He always heard little white calling her dad. He couldn’t remember anything else for a while.

“”Of course it’s the most beautiful woman in the universe.”Ye Zhuo continued, “To have such a beautiful girlfriend is simply a blessing that you’ve cultivated for three lifetimes!” ”

Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads. “Whatever the leader says is right.”

“”Then the question is, will the most beautiful woman in the universe lack suitors?”Ye Zhuo lifted his chin slightly and said with a proud face, “I’m not bragging, in my world, those who pursue me can circle the earth ten times by holding hands!” ”

“Cen Shaoqing:”...”he had always thought that Xiao Bai had influenced ye Zhuo, but now it seemed that it was ye Zhuo who had influenced Xiao Bai. ”

“After all, like father, like son. ”

“Ye Zhuo looked at Cen Shaoqing and had a playful thought. He then said, “Mr. Cen, do you think that a suitor who can go around ten times holding hands will lack a boyfriend?” ”

“Hearing this, Cen Shaoqing was stunned. ”

His heart was a little stifled.

“Even though he was prepared for ye Zhuo to have a boyfriend in the past, he still felt a little uncomfortable. ”

“Ye Zao saw the change in Cen Shaoqing’s expression. “Not only have I had a boyfriend, I have more than one.” ”

More than one? !

Then how many?

Cen Shaoqing turned to look at ye Zao. “Then what’s my rank?”

“”Yeah, let me do the math.”Ye Zao thought about it. ”

Cen Shaoqing thought about how many men were like him in the past. They had held ye Zao’s hand and might have even kissed him. Cen Shaoqing was about to go into seclusion. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

It didn’t matter.

It didn’t matter.

Cen Shaoqing tried his best to calm himself down.

“No matter how many boyfriends ye Zao had in the past, that was just the past. ”

“As long as the person standing by her side was him, it would be fine. ”

Let bygones be bygones!

“Cen Shaoqing thought that his self-adjustment ability was very good, and his ability to accept things was much better than an ordinary person. But when he thought of how many boyfriends ye Zao had in the past, his heart was still filled with jealousy, he could not wait to immediately travel to the future world and kick all those men away! ”

Ye Zao could only be his sole leader!

“”I remember now, you are the 108th,”ye Zao continued to speak. ”

The 108th?

He was actually ranked 108th!
