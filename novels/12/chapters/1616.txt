“In the past, who would dare to talk about her like that behind her back without ye Zhuo? ”

And Now?

What was she being called? !

These bitches who climbed up the ladder and trampled on the lower ones.

Just you wait.

“When the two-year agreement arrives, she will make all these people who once ridiculed her regret it beyond measure! ”

Tang Xue clenched her fists.

In the fitness area.

“After a small setback, ye Zao ran for another hour or so. Then, he went to the first floor, ready to eat something on the first floor. ”

“”Isn’t that my goddess?”He ziteng stood on the other side of the fitness area. When he saw ye Zao, he said excitedly, “Fifth brother, I’ll go and greet my goddess first.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing slightly raised his eyes. Then, his pupils suddenly shrank. He used the hand holding the Buddha bead to cover he ziteng’s eyes. “Don’t Look!” ”

“He ziteng was stunned. Before he could say anything, CEN Shaoqing continued, “Turn around!” ”

“It was an order, and his voice was almost overflowing with ice. ”

What was going on?

How did Cen Shaoqing suddenly become so scary?

He ziteng was a little stunned. He did as he was told and quickly turned around.

“Looking at He ziteng’s back, CEN Shaoqing continued, “Wait here for a while. Don’t turn around. I’ll be right there!” ”

“After saying that, CEN Shaoqing quickly ran over. ”

“He ziteng did not dare to turn around. He could only raise his voice and ask, “What’s wrong, fifth brother? What are you not letting me see?” ”

No one behind him responded.

“But even if no one behind him responded, he ziteng still did not dare to turn around. He muttered softly, “What’s wrong? Why Won’t you let me turn around!” ”

“Cen Shaoqing ran all the way to Ye Zao and took off his coat. Without saying a word, he draped it over ye Zao’s body. “Ancestor, why did you run out dressed like this? !” ”

Hot Pants.

Suspenders.

“Exposing his arms and legs, it was simply too revealing! ”

This was not possible!

Only he could see his wife!

“Ye Zao was slightly stunned by Cen Shaoqing’s actions. He just looked at him. “Cen Shaoqing, what are you doing?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing carefully fastened the last button. After making sure that he could not see anything, he was slightly satisfied. He then said, “Leader, let’s discuss something.” ”

“”Go ahead,”ye Zao said. ”

“Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted slightly. “In the future, can you wear this kind of suspenders to go out?” ”

“Why?”Ye Zao asked.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “There are too few fabrics, and there are too many people in the gym with too many eyes...” ”

Even though ye Zao had worn a swimsuit with him when they were on vacation on the island previously.

“But at that time, there was only him and ye Zao on the island, and there was no other person. ” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Only then did ye Zao realize that Cen Shaoqing disliked her for wearing too little, he said somewhat speechlessly, “What era is it now? Isn’t it normal to wear this way? Your thoughts are too conservative! Why are you like an old man? You’re not allowed to wear this or that!” ”

“”You can wear it, but you can only wear it for me to see.”Cen Shaoqing whispered into her ear. ”

Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly. He felt that Cen Shaoqing’s request was a little overbearing. His red lips parted slightly. “I’m not your personal property. How I dress is my freedom.”

“”Leader, I beg you!” ”

Ye Zhuo did not say anything.

Cen Shaoqing continued to pray.

“After a while, Ye Zao raised his eyes slightly. “Alright! Seeing that your attitude is so sincere, I will reluctantly agree to you. However, I also have a request.” ”

“”Leader, speak.”Hearing ye Zao agree, Cen Shaoqing’s eyes lit up. ”

“Ye Zao continued, “I haven’t thought of what request. When I think of it, I will tell you again.” ”

“”Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Thank you, leader.” ”

“Ye Zao smiled. “By the way, didn’t you say that you were busy? Why did you have time to come to the fitness area?” ”

“CEN Shaoqing said, “I came with Ziteng.” ”

“”OH.”Ye Zao continued, “Then you guys go ahead. I’ll go back to the office first.” ”

“I’ll send you off.”Cen Shaoqing followed ye Zao’s footsteps.

The two of them chatted as they walked. They were very intimate.

“Cen Shaoqing was nearly 1.95 meters tall, while ye Zao was only 1.73 meters tall. Cen Shaoqing’s bones were big and strong, causing ye Zao to wear his coat like a child stealing an adult’s clothes. ”

Tang Xue just happened to see this scene. She was so angry that she almost vomited blood.

She originally thought that Cen Shaoqing and ye Zao were not suitable for each other and that they would break up one day.

“She did not expect that after such a long time, not only did they not break up, their relationship was getting better and better. ”
