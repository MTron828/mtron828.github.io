Translator: 549690339

“Lin Qingxuan looked at Lin Jincheng. “Jincheng, you can go back first.” ”

“Fourth brother!”

“Lin Qingxuan looked up at Zhao shuning. “Shuning, I was wrong about what happened today. I’ve let you down. I promise you, there won’t be a next time.” ”

Lin Jincheng looked at Lin Qingxuan in disbelief.

His fourth brother had once been a very proud person.

What had he become so weak?

“If Zhao shuning was reasonable, it was understandable that Lin Qingxuan would apologize to her. ”

But Zhao shuning was completely unreasonable.

“In front of so many servants, she actually made Lin Qingxuan kneel! ”

How would Lin Qingxuan raise her head in front of the servants in the future?

“What made Lin Jincheng even more incredulous was that throughout the entire process, Lin Qingxuan did not even resist. ”

Zhao shuning looked at Lin Qingxuan. “Follow me back to my room first!”

Only then did Lin Qingxuan stand up from the ground and walk towards the west courtyard with Zhao shuning.

Lin Jincheng looked at their backs and frowned.

On the other side.

The CEN Group.

In the office on the top floor.

“A slender man was sitting at his desk, handling official business. His thin lips were tightly pursed, and his ten fingers were constantly jumping on the keyboard. There was a string of Red Buddhist beads in the palm of his left hand, the fluorescent light reflected from the computer screen coated his cold facial features with a shallow halo. ”

“”Fifth Master! Something happened!”At this moment, assistant Jiang ran in in panic without even knocking on the door. ”

“Cen Shaoqing looked up unhappily and said in a slightly cold tone, “What is it that makes you so flustered? What have I taught you usually?” ”

Special Assistant Jiang shuddered and took a deep breath. “It’s about Miss Ye.”

Miss Ye?

Padah —

The Buddhist beads in Cen Shaoqing’s hand fell to the ground. “What’s wrong with Miss Ye?”

“Special Assistant Jiang gulped. Before he could speak, Cen Shaoqing continued, “Speak! Are You Deaf? I’m asking you, what’s wrong with Miss Ye?” ”

“Special Assistant Jiang:”? ? ?”Didn’t he say that no matter what happened, he had to remain calm and composed? ”

“Speak quickly!”

Special Assistant Jiang suppressed the fear in his heart and told Cen Shaoqing everything about Li Yibiao.

Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly. His face was instantly covered with an impenetrable layer of ice.

“Whose idea was this?”

“Special assistant Jiang continued, “It was fourth madam Lin.” ”

“”Good! Very good!”Cen Shaoqing didn’t get angry. Instead, he laughed. “Go and look up Zhao Shuning’s information! Then, get Vice President Bai to come up.” ”

This smile was too sinister.

Executive Assistant Jiang felt a chill on the back of his neck. “I’ll go right away.”

Vice President Bai quickly came up.

“”Fifth master, you were looking for me.”Vice President Bai’s attitude was respectful. ”

Cen Shaoqing was counting the Buddhist beads in his hand. “Does Li Yibiao Know?”

“I’ve heard of him.”vice-president Bai nodded.

“I’ll give you a task now!”Cen Shaoqing suddenly stood up. “Kill the Li Corporation! Go To Hell!”

“Vice-president Bai was stunned at first, then said, “Okay.” ”

“Go out.”

“Vice-president Bai bowed and walked out. He just happened to bump into special assistant Jiang outside and asked curiously, “Fifth master, What’s Wrong? Why are you targeting the Li Corporation all of a sudden?” ”

“After all, in front of Cen Shaoqing, the Li Corporation was not even a fly’s leg. ”

Cen Shaoqing had no reason to suddenly attack the Li Corporation.

“Special Assistant Jiang suppressed his voice and said, “I was angry at the Crown for the beauty! I can only say that Li Yibiao has no eyes and offended the person at the heart of our Fifth Master!” ”

The person at the heart?

Could It Be Miss Ye?

Vice President Bai’s face was full of surprise. He did not expect that Cen Shaoqing would also be angry at the crown for the beauty.

“Special Assistant Jiang continued, “Vice President Bai, I Won’t talk to you anymore. Master five has also instructed me to do other things!” ”

Vice President Bai nodded and hurried to his office.

“Cen Shaoqing was angry for a woman. Then, he had to perform well this time so that the Li family would never have a chance to turn things around! ”

“In the evening, special assistant Jiang brought Zhao Shuning’s information into the office. “Master five, we’ve found everything!” ” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Give it to me.”Cen Shaoqing put down the document in his hands and took the information that special assistant Jiang handed over.

“Cen Shaoqing read through the information with a glance. The more he read, the more he frowned. ”

Change his name?

Zhao shuning actually had the delusion of changing ye Zhuo’s name!

“Special Assistant Jiang hesitated and said, “Master Five.” ”

“Speak.”Cen Shaoqing’s tone was slightly cold.

“Special Assistant Jiang continued, “We also found out that Zhao Shuning’s infertility was to cover up for Miss Ye’s fourth uncle. The person who was truly infertile was Miss Ye’s fourth uncle. “But the truth wasn’t like that. When Zhao shuning found out about the infertility, he was afraid that Miss Ye’s fourth uncle would divorce him, so he bribed the doctor at the time and turned the infertile person into Miss Ye’s fourth uncle.” ”

“There’s such a Thing?”Cen Shaoqing raised his eyebrows.

“Yes.”Special Assistant Jiang nodded.

“Cen Shaoqing waved his hand. “Alright, you can leave now.” ”

Executive Assistant Jiang walked out of the office.

Cen Shaoqing took out his phone and sent a message to ye Zao.

At the Lin residence.

“While Zhao Shuning was asleep, Lin Qingxuan came downstairs to the garden to relax. ”

“The sky was filled with stars. Gusts of Night Wind Blew, bringing with it the fragrance of flowers. It was already slightly cold in the ninth month of the lunar calendar. ”

“However, Lin Qingxuan did not feel the cold at all. Instead, he felt especially relaxed. ”

“In that room, he felt that even breathing was oppressive. ”

“Fourth brother.”

“At this moment, Lin Jincheng’s voice appeared in the air. ”

“Jincheng.”Lin Qingxuan turned to look at Lin Jincheng.

“Lin Jincheng walked over. “Fourth brother, do you have time to talk to me?” ”

The palm print on Lin Qingxuan’s face had not completely disappeared. “Do you want to talk to me about what happened in the evening?”

“”Yes.”Lin Jincheng continued, “Fourth brother, let’s talk in the gazebo over there?” ”

Lin Qingxuan nodded and the two brothers walked into the gazebo.

“After entering the gazebo, the two brothers sat on the stone bench. Lin Jincheng took the initiative to speak, “Fourth brother, I remember that you weren’t like this in the past.” ”

“”People change.”Lin Qingxuan sighed, his eyes filled with guilt. “Your fourth sister-in-law is a good woman. I let her down...” ”

“Lin Jincheng frowned slightly. “Fourth brother, what happened to make you tolerate her to such an extent?” ”

“If Zhao Shuning was worthy of Lin Qingxuan’s treatment, then so be it. ”

“However, Zhao Shuning was not worthy at all. ”

Lin Qingxuan was silent.

How could he say something like this?

“”Fourth uncle, actually, the one who is truly infertile is Zhao shuning. You took the blame for her for twenty-one years.” ”

“Before he arrived, the voice came first. ”

“Lin Qingxuan looked up and saw a pair of jade-white hands opening the layers of beaded curtains. Then, a slender figure appeared in the pavilion. ”
