Chapter 2369: 494: mixed emotions

Translator: 549690339

Lin Ze held Bai Jingshu’s hand and the two of them walked out.

“Looking at their backs, Bai Mo’s eyes were terrifyingly vicious, as if they were poisoned. ”

“Regret, anger, jealousy, disgust, all sorts of emotions mixed together, and Bai Mo almost suffocated. ”

No one could understand this feeling!

“Bai Jingshu and Lin Ze went outside together. After taking a few breaths of fresh air, the knot in Bai Jingshu’s heart dissipated quite a bit. ”

“Ah Ze.”

“Mm.”Lin Ze lowered his head to look at Bai Jingshu.

“Bai Jingshu considered her choice of words in her heart before continuing, “Let me ask you a question.” ”

“”You ask,”Lin ze said. ”

“Bai Jingshu continued, “You have to answer me seriously. I Won’t lie to You.” ”

“Alright.”Lin Ze nodded.

“”If Bai Mo hadn’t rejected you back then, would you have gotten together with her?”Bai Jingshu asked. ”

The reason why she asked this was because she could see the unwillingness in Bai Mo’s eyes.

“”No,”Lin ze said without hesitation. “Even if Bai Mo didn’t reject me, I wouldn’t have had any follow-up relationship with her.” ”

This was because Lin ze didn’t have a good impression of Bai Mo from the first time he saw her.

“Eye contact was really important, but even though he didn’t know much about Bai Mo, Lin Ze still didn’t like her. ”

“Why?”Bai Jingshu asked.

“Lin Ze Thought for a moment. “Maybe it’s because of my sixth sense. When I first saw Bai Mo, I felt that she wasn’t suitable for me.” ”

“What about the first time you saw me?”Bai Jingshu looked at Lin Ze. “What was your impression of me then?”

“They had never discussed this question before, so Bai Jingshu was curious. ”

“Lin Ze thought back to their first meeting and smiled. “Yes, I feel that you’re very quiet. You’re very different from others. You’re like a plum tree that doesn’t get stained by the secular world.” ”

“Although his words were a little artistic, these were Lin Ze’s real thoughts. ”

Bai Jingshu was indeed very different from others.

“She was born in the s galaxy, but she loved Earth’s culture. She even had a writer’s vest on Earth, and she was a god who wrote historical facts. ”

“This made Lin ze admire her a lot, because even he, a native of Earth, did not understand Earth’s ancient culture as well as Bai Jingshu did. ”

“Bai Jingshu was like a walking history, using words to recreate the miracle of the past. ”

“Really?”Bai Jingshu was in disbelief.

She did not expect that she would leave such a good impression on Lin Ze.

“Really.”Lin Ze nodded seriously. “What about me? What was your first impression of me?”

“”Um...”Bai Jingshu thought about it. “I feel that you’re quite serious and serious. You’re also very handsome, which is in line with my aesthetic standards...” ”

Lin Ze happened to be good at Bai Jingshu’s aesthetic standards.

“No matter how she looked at it, Lin Ze was the best. ”

“Lin Ze’s eyes curved into crescents as he reached out to hold Bai Jingshu’s hand. “Jingshu, thank you.” ”

“A long time ago, Lin Ze had always thought that he would get married later than ye Zao. After all, when ye Zao was dating, he was still single. ” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

He had never expected that he would enter the marriage hall so quickly.

This feeling was very wonderful and also very blissful.

“Thank me for what?”Bai Jingshu wrapped her left hand around his waist. “I should be the one thanking you. You’ve made me believe again that love exists in this world.”

“Bai Jingshu was almost fooled by the scumbag. Fortunately, Lin Ze had appeared in time. Moreover, Lin Ze and she shared a common interest. ”

“When the two of them were together, the most important thing was that they shared the same values, interests, and topics. ”

She and Lin Ze were just like that.

“Unknowingly, the two of them had already spoken a lot of heartfelt words. ”

“Bai Mo stood on the other side of the door and looked at the two of them. She held onto the door frame with her left hand. Because she had used too much strength, her nails were deeply embedded in the door frame, and her fingertips were slightly white. ”

She felt terrible!

Why?

Why did she have to treat her like this?

“She had never been as good as Bai Jingshu since she was young. It was not easy for her to win against Bai Jingshu in marriage, but now... ”

She was still snatched away by Bai Jingshu.

Why was Bai Jingshu so fond of snatching other people’s things?

Why didn’t she feel the slightest bit of shame?

“A moment later, Bai Mo picked up the communicator and sent a message to Bai Yuanyuan. ”

Bai Yuanyuan quickly rushed over after receiving the message.

Bai Mo felt a little better when she saw Bai Yuanyuan.

“Bai Yuanyuan called Old Master Bai and walked to Bai Mo’s side. She gently patted Bai Mo’s hand and said in a low voice, “Momo, don’t worry.” ”

“Yes.”Bai Mo nodded.
