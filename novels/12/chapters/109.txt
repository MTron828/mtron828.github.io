Chapter 110: 077: setting people up, burning online, birthday banquet venue 3

“Which Song Family?”Shen Rong was stunned.

Mu Yourong suppressed the fear in her heart. “Song group, Song Shiyu.”

After saying this, Mu Yourong continued, “Song Shiyu has yet to marry...”

“You Want Ye Zhuo to marry song Shiyu?”Big Soldier Mu’s words revealed Mu Yourong’s thoughts.

Mu Yourong nodded.

“The song clan holds a high position in the capital, and Song Shiyu is the only successor of the song clan. At such a young age, he has already taken the position of the head of the song clan group. Although such a person can not be compared to fifth master Cen, he can still be evenly matched with him.”Soldier Mu paused, then he said, “Yourong, I know that you are a kind and good child, but ye Zao is not worth it.”

Song Shiyu was a famous handsome man in the cloud capital. He was only twenty-six years old this year.

Not only did he have the looks of a boy and a girl, he was incomparably beautiful and also had strength.

Given time, he would definitely soar to the heavens!

If it were not for fifth master Cen, Song Shiyu would be more than enough to match up with Mu Yourong.

What did ye Zao count as?

Mu Yourong was good in everything, but she was too kind!

She actually treated her as a younger sister, and even wanted to set song Shiyu up with Ye Zao...

Mu Yourong smiled. “Father, you only know the first part and not the second part. I naturally have my reasons for this arrangement.”

Although song Shiyu was famous on the outside,.

He was extremely corrupt and dark on the inside.

Back then, Song Shiyu had married her.

But he did not treat her like a wife, and he had never touched her.

He tortured her every day, and in the end, he destroyed the MU Corporation. His parents also died in a fire.

Mu Yourong would never believe that the fire had nothing to do with song Shiyu!

To Mu Yourong, Song Shiyu was a demon!

A demon that ate people.

When she thought about it now, Mu Yourong still had lingering fear in her heart.

When she was young and ignorant, she actually thought that song Shiyu was a good man...

Now that she thought about it, it was really laughable!

“But no matter what you do, you can’t let ye Zao Marry Song Shiyu!”Shen Rong frowned and continued, “Ye Zao no longer puts you in his eyes. If she marries into the song family, she will definitely use song Shiyu to suppress us! If it were up to me, I would take this opportunity to teach that little slut a lesson! Let that little slut not be able to turn the tables!”

“Mom, don’t worry.”Mu Yourong’s eyes flashed with determination. “Song Shiyu won’t!” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Song Shiyu was a heartless demon.

Would he fight for a woman?

Mu Yourong had married him for so long, but she had never seen song Shiyu treat any woman better.

To him, a woman was just a Doll!

Song Shiyu’s hands were stained with blood, and he didn’t even spare his biological father.

Ye Zao marrying him was equivalent to falling into Hell on Earth!

No!

It would be even worse than falling into hell!

Shen Rong did not understand why her daughter was so confident, she continued, “Even if song Shiyu would not stand up for ye Zao, yourong, it’s not like you don’t know what kind of family the song clan is. What makes you think that song Shiyu would listen to you and obediently marry ye Zao?”

The song family was equivalent to the emperor of the cloud capital.

Not to mention the MU family.

Even the high officials of the cloud capital had to give them some face.

“I received an invitation to the song family’s banquet the day after tomorrow.”Mu yourong continued, “I plan to bring ye Zao along.”

According to Mu Yourong’s understanding of Song Shiyu.

She loved torturing beautiful women the most.

Otherwise, the her in her previous life wouldn’t have died so miserably.

Ye Zao was so beautiful, and his end would probably be ten times, a hundred times, a thousand times worse than hers!

A sinister smile appeared on Mu Yourong’s lips.

“You got the song family’s invitation?”Hearing this, soldier Mu and Shen Rong were both shocked.

When did Mu Yourong become so familiar with song Shiyu?

Actually, even Mu Yourong herself didn’t know.

In her previous life, she had just returned to the Mu family when she received the song family’s invitation.

At the banquet, she had fallen in love with song Shiyu at first sight. She would not marry him unless it was him.

She did not expect that it would turn into a nightmare for her.

This life was different from her previous life.

With Ye Zhuo as a stepping stone, ye Zhuo would fall into Hell on Earth, while she would walk to the peak of her life!

Song Shiyu was so good-looking. At that time, Ye Zhuo would definitely fall madly in love with him.

Just like her in her previous life.

She would not marry without him!

Thinking of this, the corners of Mu Yourong’s lips curled up. Her eyes were filled with pride as she continued, “So, mother, in a while, you will go with me to the Ye family and let ye Zhuo know that our mu family actually still cares about her very much.”

Shen Rong’s brows were deeply furrowed. “Yourong, mother is really getting more and more confused about you. What kind of family is the Shen Family? How can you let ye Zhuo climb up to the song family!”She really did not understand why mu yourong would treat ye Zhuo so well!
