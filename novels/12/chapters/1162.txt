“Just as she walked to the entrance of the theater, she saw a familiar figure. ”

It was ye Zhuo.

“Beside ye Zhuo stood a man in plain clothes, holding a string of bright red Buddhist beads in his hand. When two people like this stood together, it was obvious that they were dragons and phoenixes among men, and they could not be underestimated. ”

“She did not know if ye Zhuo saw Granny Zhou, but she did not take the initiative to greet her. ” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Granny Zhou frowned slightly.

“If it were any other time, ye Zao would definitely greet her. ”

The reason why he did not greet her today was definitely because he was guilty.

After all.

Ye Zao had almost caused her death!

This was a human life!

“Ye Zao had a big heart. He actually dared to go shopping and watch a drama. Even if she had not caused anyone’s death, Auntie Wang’s lover’s condition had worsened because of her! ”

Did she not feel guilty at all?

She had no conscience at all.

It had to be said that this descendant of the Ye family had really disappointed her!

“She had originally thought that ye Zhuo was a talent that could be molded. She did not expect that in the end, she was still blind to see the wrong person. ”

“”Yuan Cui, did you see an acquaintance?”Old Lady Wang turned to look at Granny Zhou. ”

Granny Zhou reacted and smiled. “No.”

“Old Lady Wang continued, “Then let’s go in quickly.” ”

Granny Zhou nodded and followed everyone inside.

“Halfway through the drama, Granny Zhou got up and went to the bathroom. ”

“Coincidentally, she bumped into ye Zhuo in the bathroom. ”

“Granny Zhou.”Ye Zhuo greeted her politely when he saw someone he knew.

“A hint of displeasure flashed across Granny Zhou’s face, but she still nodded and said, “Miss Ye, you’re here to watch the drama too?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Granny Zhou continued, “Miss Ye, why don’t You Ask Me How I’m doing now that I took the prescription you gave me last time?” ”

Ye Zhuo was stunned. “Didn’t you not take it?”

“How do you know that I didn’t take it?”Granny Zhou asked.

“Ye Zhuo explained, “Aunt Wang told me.” ”

“Granny Zhou looked at Ye Zhuo. “So, you know about Aunt Wang?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Granny Zhou continued, “Since you already know about it, how do you plan to compensate Auntie Wang and the rest? “One can have nothing but a conscience. After all, Auntie Wang’s lover took the medicine you gave her to aggravate her condition!” ”

“You might have misunderstood...”

“Before ye Zhuo could finish his sentence, Granny Zhou had already planned it. “Misunderstood? What misunderstanding? Do you know that Auntie Wang has already resigned because her lover’s condition has worsened? Miss Ye, do you still want to Quibble?” ”

“”Auntie Wang’s lover has already recovered. As for why she resigned, I’m not too sure either. You’ve really misunderstood me!”Ye Zhuo’s face did not show any expression as he continued to explain patiently. ”

Quibble!

“Ye Zhuo even made Su Qiang’s condition worsen. Not only did he not feel guilty at all, he was even quibbling now. ”

“Granny Zhou was so angry that her face changed. “Miss Ye, do you think you can live up to the conscience of the world with Your Words? How can the Ye family have a descendant like you! You’re simply embarrassing yourself!” ”

“Ye Zhuo could not be bothered to argue with an old man. “Granny Zhou, facts speak louder than words. If you don’t believe me, you can go to Auntie Wang’s house to have a look.” ”

“The old man did not believe her now. No matter what she said, she would not believe it. ”

“After saying this, Ye Zhuo turned around and walked out of the door. ”

Granny Zhou looked at Ye Zhuo’s back and was so angry that her temples were throbbing. It took her a long time to react.

Should I go to sister-in-law Wang’s house to take a look?

It was all thanks to ye Zao that he could say such a thing!

“Ye Zao knew that sister-in-law Wang had already moved away, but he still said it on purpose. ”

“After being so angry by Ye Zao, Granny Zhou couldn’t be bothered to watch the play anymore. She sent a message to Old Lady Wang and walked out of the theater. ”

She planned to go outside to get some fresh air.

In the theater.

Ye Zao walked to Cen Shaoqing’s side and sat down.

“Coming.”Cen Shaoqing looked back slightly and gently held her hand as if he was counting Buddhist beads. He stroked it carefully.

Her hand was very soft.

It was as if she had no bones.

It was as white as jade.

Ye Zhuo leaned on his shoulder and continued to watch the play.

Every breath he took was filled with each other’s breath.

...

On the other side.

The Jin family.

Old Master Jin held the information that his assistant had found and the corners of his mouth were full of ridicule. “You want to marry Fifth Master? You’re simply Daydreaming!”

“Uncle Fu said, “Why don’t you send this information to young master?” ”

“Old Master Jin shook his head. “It’s useless. Even if he sees it, he’ll think that it’s my doing.” ”

The lawyer did not have the slightest trust in him.

This move would not work.

“Uncle Fu frowned. “Then what should we do? Looking at the way Zhao Zhenfei and Zhao Xueyin are behaving, it’s clear that they want to treat young master as a spare tire.”Father Zhao’s goal was very simple, if master five did not like Zhao Xueyin, then find a sensible and obedient son-in-law who could come to visit. ”
