“”Silly cat, I’m sorry! It’s all my fault for not looking after you! I caused your death!””

“”Silly cat, come back! From now on, I won’t hide your dried fish anymore.””

“Silly cat! Come back quickly!”

...

“In the blink of an eye, the next day arrived.”

Today was the day father Zhao and the Qian family agreed to meet.

“No matter how unwilling Zhao Xueyin was, she could only quietly accept Father Zhao’s arrangements.”

“At 11 am, Liu Sanniang brought Qian Dafu and Qian Xiaochuan to the Zhao family on time.”

“Liu Sanniang smiled and said, “Mr. Qian, you and the Qian family head are old acquaintances, so there’s no need for me to introduce you! This is Mr. Little Qian.””

“Qian Xiaochuan stood next to Qian Dafu and looked a little dull. It was unknown whether Qian Dafu would take the initiative to greet him, but Qian Dafu took the initiative and said, “Xiaochuan, quickly greet your uncle Zhao.””

“Qian Xiaochuan held a doll in his hand and tilted his head. “Hello, Uncle Zhao...””

“”Good, all good.”Father Zhao continued, “Everyone, come in and take a seat!””

The few of them followed Father Zhao into the house.

“When they reached the hall, Father Zhao instructed the servants to pour tea for them.”

“Qian Dafu looked at Qian Xiaochuan. “Thank you, Uncle Zhao!””

“Qian Xiaochuan picked up his cup. “Thank you, thank you, Uncle Zhao.””

“Qian Xiaochuan took a sip of tea and continued, “If, if it’s coffee with sugar added, then, that would be even better. I, I, I don’t really like drinking tea...””

“Qian Dafu frowned slightly and said, “Xiaochuan, don’t be so unruly!””

“Father Zhao smiled and said, “It’s fine, it’s fine. I like honest young people! Lian Sao, go and make a cup of coffee for Mr. Qian Jr. .””

“”Yes, Master.”Lian Sao nodded.”

“Qian Xiaochuan continued, “I, I want a 50-50 cent sugar!””

“”Yes, Mr. Little Qian.””

“Soon, the coffee was served. Qian Xiaochuan took a sip.”

“Father Zhao smiled and asked, “How is it? Xiaochuan, what do you think of Uncle’s Coffee?””

“”It’s, it’s fine!””

“Xiaochuan!”Qian Dafu’s face was almost black.

“”It’s fine, it’s fine.”Father Zhao waved his hand. “She’s a child!””

“Qian dafu smiled and said, “Thank you for not haggling with her! Oh right, why didn’t I see Miss Zhao?””

“Father Zhao said, “That child is too embarrassed to go downstairs with so many people. I’ve already sent a servant to call her! Lian Sao, go and hurry Miss!””

Lian Sao turned around and walked upstairs.

“In the room, Zhao Xueyin had already changed her clothes.”

“Lian Sao walked over. “Miss, master wants you to hurry up.””

“What are you rushing me for!”

She was just a fool. Was it worth it for her to personally go down and meet him?

“”If you still don’t go down, master will be angry,”Lian Sao continued.”

“Zhao Xueyin frowned and stood up. Just as she was about to go down, she suddenly realized that she had a pimple on her face in the mirror.”

It was red.

It was also a little itchy.

Zhao Xueyin could not help but reach out to scratch it.

“In the end, the more she scratched, the more itchy it became.”

“After all this, her makeup had been scratched. Zhao Xueyin continued, “You go down first, I’ll touch up my makeup.””

Lian Sao nodded and walked downstairs.

“After about ten minutes, just as Father Zhao could not help but go upstairs to look for Zhao Xueyin, Zhao Xueyin finally arrived late. “Dad, I’m sorry. I had to settle an official matter at the last minute. Sorry to have kept you guys waiting.””

“Qian dafu hurriedly said, “It’s fine, it’s fine. The official matter is more important!””

“Father Zhao’s face also returned to a smile as he continued, “Xueyin, this is your uncle Qian. This is Uncle Qian’s son, Xiaochuan! Xiaochuan is two years older than you!””

“Zhao Xueyin raised her eyelids and replied, “Uncle Qian, Mr. Qian.””

“”Pretty, pretty, pretty sister!”Qian Xiaochuan suddenly jumped in front of Zhao Xueyin.”

Zhao Xueyin was so scared that her face turned pale and she took a few steps back.

No wonder everyone said Qian Xiaochuan was a fool!

As expected!

He was even more of a fool than a fool!

“”Don’t come over!”Zhao Xueyin looked at Qian Xiaochuan, her eyes full of disgust.”

“At this moment, a crisp ringtone sounded in the air. Qian Dafu said, “Sorry, I have to go out to take a call.””

“Go Ahead!”Father Zhao said.

“After Qian Dafu walked out, Father Zhao gave Zhao Xueyin a warning look.”

Outside.

“The call was from Mrs. Qian. After hearing what Mrs. Qian said, Qian Dafu said in disbelief, “Is what you said true?””

“”Nonsense! Whether it’s true or not, you’ll know when you go online and see for Yourself!””

Qian Dafu did not say anything else and immediately turned on his phone.

“After seeing the overwhelming news online, his expression changed. Then, he quickly went back to the hall and grabbed Qian Xiaochuan’s hand. “Come back with me quickly!””

“”I, I, I want a pretty sister!””

“What pretty! Come with me quickly!”Qian Dafu pulled Qian Xiaochuan away.

“All of this happened too quickly. By the time Father Zhao and Liu Sanniang reacted, the father and son had already gone far away.”

Father Zhao frowned. “What’s going on with them?”

“Liu Sanniang was also confused. After a moment, she continued, “Could it be Miss Zhao’s attitude?””

Father Zhao looked at Zhao Xueyin. “Quickly call your uncle Qian and Little Chuan to apologize! Tell him to come back quickly!”

Zhao Xueyin was stunned?

Make her apologize?

Apologize to a fool?

Impossible!

“Just then, the butler rushed in from outside, his face covered in sweat, “Old, Old Master! This is bad! This is bad!””
