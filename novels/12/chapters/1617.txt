“Even more unexpectedly, ye Zao even wore Cen Shaoqing’s clothes. ”

“Others might not know, but Tang Xue knew very well. ”

“Cen Shaoqing had a very serious mysophobia. Usually, if outsiders accidentally touched his clothes, he would have to disinfect them several times. ”

“Unexpectedly, this time, he actually directly put the coat on ye Zao. ”

How could she not be jealous.

Tang Xue was so jealous that she was about to go crazy!

But she still tried her best to calm herself down.

She could not be angry.

It was not the time yet.

“When the two-year pact was over, she would make everyone regret it! ”

Tang Xue only retracted her gaze when ye Zao and Cen Shaoqing’s figures disappeared in front of her.

“When Cen Shaoqing appeared in the fitness area, it was already half an hour later. ”

“He ziteng was still standing there obediently. Without Cen Shaoqing’s words, he did not even dare to turn his head. ”

“You can turn around now.”Until Cen Shaoqing’s voice appeared in the air again.

“He ziteng turned his head and said in surprise, “Fifth brother, you’re finally back! If you don’t come back soon, I’m going to turn into a Rock!” ”

“After he said that, he ziteng continued, “Fifth brother, what did you not let me see just now? You’re So Mysterious!” ”

He was really very curious.

What exactly made Cen Shaoqing panic like that.

“In his eyes, Cen Shaoqing had always been a calm and self-controlled person. He had never been like that just now ”

“Nothing.”Cen Shaoqing’s tone was indifferent. It was as if the person who had lost control just now was not him.

“”Nothing?”He ziteng narrowed his eyes and continued, “Fifth brother, I know that you’re definitely hiding something from me! Please, can you just tell me? What secret do you have that I can’t See?” ”

“”Since it’s something that you can’t see, do you think I’ll tell you?”Cen Shaoqing looked back slightly and asked. ”

He ziteng:”...”

“Time flew like an arrow, and the sun and moon moved quickly. ”

“In the blink of an eye, another year had passed. ”

There was only half a month left until the two-year agreement on the aircraft carrier.

“During this period of time, Tang Xue was very pleased with herself. She wished that she could walk while humming a little song. ” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Especially these days, there were new problems coming from the large C area. ”

“Today, there were problems with the defense system. ”

“Tomorrow, it was the flight system. ”

“And the day after that, it was the power source. ”

The new problems were increasing almost every day.

In the office.

“Because ye Zhuo had signed a confidentiality agreement with the people from the large C area, Tang Xue had specially arranged for someone to stay in the large C area. She had to report the situation to Tang Xue almost every day. ”

“Liu Jin stood in front of the office desk and said obsequiously, “Miss Tang, don’t worry. Not to mention that ye Zhuo won’t be able to successfully develop the aircraft carrier in half a month, even if she was given another two years, she might not be able to complete it!” ”

“Tang Xue curled the corners of her lips and continued, “But I heard that the overall structure of the aircraft carrier has been completed. Now, it’s just waiting to fly.” ”

“Liu Jin’s lips were full of sarcasm. “That’s just an empty shell! With the design, who wouldn’t know how to copy it?” ”

Everyone in Area C knew that the aircraft carrier ye Zao created was just an empty shell.

It couldn’t fly at all!

“Tang Xue nodded. “Alright, you can leave first.” ”

“”Miss Tang, if you have any instructions, you can call me anytime,”Liu Jin said. ”

“At the same time, the international websites were also in an uproar! ”

“[ the two-year agreement is about to arrive, why is there still no news from China? ]? [ May I ask where Dr. YC went? ? ]? [ where did the CEN base go? ]? [ where did the authorities go? ]? [ why didn’t they come out to explain? ]? [ aren’t they trying to cheat? ] ”

“[ isn’t it normal to cheat? Do you think they will really honor the bet? Chinese people are naturally cunning! Also, that YC probably ran away a long time ago! ] ”
