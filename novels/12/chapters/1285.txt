“Chapter 1286: 270: boss, she’s making her move! 7”

“Don’t worry.”

Jerry glanced at Mike before turning around to leave.

On the other side.

At the police station.

“Ye Zao came to the interrogation room and looked at Father Zhao, who was separated by a glass window. “He still won’t tell us?” ”

“”Yeah.”Captain Li took out a cigarette. Just as he was about to smoke it, he saw ye Zao’s side profile and silently stuffed the cigarette back into his mouth. “Zhao Zhenfei has been insisting that he doesn’t know Mike.” ”

The current ye Zao was a big shot in front of Captain Li.

He could even smoke without restraint in front of director Liu.

“But in front of ye Zao, he couldn’t. ”

Maybe.

This was the legendary bloodline suppression.

“Not to mention smoking, ever since he had seen ye Zao’s ability, he felt a great pressure even when he took a deep breath. ”

“Have you found Mike?”Ye Zao continued to ask.

“Captain Li shook his head. “Mike is not only good at disguising himself, he also has a strong anti-detection ability. Our people are currently unable to lock onto his location.” ”

“Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly. At this moment, he seemed to have thought of something and continued to ask, “Which computer can be used?” ”

“Upon hearing this, captain Li’s eyes lit up. ”

Was the big boss going to make a move?

“”Miss Ye, come with me.” ”

Ye Zhuo followed Captain Li’s footsteps.

“The two of them had just reached the office when officer Yin brought a bespectacled young man in, “Captain Li, let me introduce you. This is my good friend, Wang Junxi. At the same time, he’s also a tracking expert sent by the higher-ups to support us.” ”

“Captain Li immediately extended his hand to Wang Junxi. “Hello, Mr. Wang.” ”

“”Hello, Captain Li.”When Wang Junxi shook hands with Captain Li, he noticed ye Zhuo beside him. ”

“Captain Li continued, “Little Yin, please take care of Mr. Wang First.” ”

“Wang junxi smiled and said, “I don’t need to take care of him. Just give me a computer.” ”

Officer Yin patted the computer table beside him. “Use mine.”

Wang Junxi walked over and sat down.

Captain Li also took ye Zao and sat down beside him.

The air was filled with crackling sounds.

“Wang Junxi turned on the computer and operated it for a while. Then, he turned to look at officer Yin. “That little girl is also an expert in tracking?” ”

“Yes.”Officer Yin nodded. “Don’t Judge Miss Ye by her young age. She’s actually very impressive! She was the one who restored the surveillance footage from before!”

Wang Junxi nodded.

He was not good at restoring surveillance footage.

“However, in the field of tracking, if he was ranked first, no one would dare to claim to be second. ”

“Today, he had to teach the little girl a lesson. ”

Of course.

It would be great to win the heart of a beauty while he was at it.

“Wang Junxi curled the corners of his lips and straightened his expression. He began to operate the keyboard. Soon, the computer screen was filled with code that no one could understand. ”

“After a moment, Wang Junxi turned to look at officer Yin. ”

“Three days.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“What three days?”Officer Yin was stunned.

“Wang Junxi continued, “Give me three days, and I’ll be able to lock onto Mike’s location.” ”

“Are you sure you only need three days?”Officer Yin was very excited.

Wang Junxi’s gaze inadvertently swept past ye Zao. “When have I ever lied to You?”

“”Brother, thank you so much!” ”

“You’re welcome.”

Beep Beep —

“At this moment, a series of beeps suddenly sounded in the air. ”

“What’s that sound?”Officer Yin asked.

Ye Zao took off his headphones. “Mike’s location has been locked onto successfully.”

The lock was successful.

Wang Junxi was completely dumbfounded. He came behind ye Zao and saw the little red dot on the computer screen. The disbelief in his eyes slowly turned into shock.

“If he had not seen it with his own eyes, he would never have believed that it was done by a young girl who looked to be only eighteen or nineteen years old. ”

“Just three minutes ago, he was still feeling proud that he could lock onto Mike’s location within three days. ”

He did not expect that ye Zhuo would be able to do it in just a few minutes!

Just who was conquering whom?

“When Captain Li, who was smoking outside, heard this, he immediately put out his cigarette and ran in. “Miss Ye, what did you say? Have you locked onto Mike’s position?” ”

“”Yes.”Ye Zhuo continued, “Lan Ting Bar.” ”

Captain Li looked at officer Yin. “Inform everyone to gather! We’ll send out the police immediately!”

“Okay.”Officer Yin nodded and immediately went to gather everyone.

“Half an hour later, the police car surrounded the orchid pavilion bar. ”

“Mike, who was inside, also realized that something was wrong. He walked towards the bathroom and pressed the button hidden in his clothes. ”

“In just a second, Mike’s black shirt turned into a white shirt. ”

His casual pants had also turned into suit pants.

Bang —

A pair of sneakers was thrown into the trash can.

“By the time Mike walked into the bathroom, he had gone from an exotic boy to a successful business elite. Most importantly, his exotic facial features had also turned into Chinese facial features. ”

Mike leaned against the sink and fiddled with the watch on his wrist.

Click —

“The watch immediately turned into a small computer, and a red laser keyboard appeared on the washing table. ”

“Mike operated the computer with one hand, and soon, the CCTV outside the bar appeared on the transparent screen. ”

The four exits of the bar were surrounded by the police.

The hall was also being cleared.

Tsk.

The police came fast enough.

The corners of Mike’s lips curled up. He just didn’t know who the person standing behind them was.

“A moment later, Mike came out of the bathroom. ”

“”Stop, it’s a routine check.”A police officer blocked Mike’s way. “Let’s take a look at your ID card.” ”

Mike took out an ID card.

The police officer reached out and took it.

There was no problem with the ID card.

“You can go now.”

Mike took the ID card with a sarcastic look in his eyes.

He had thought that these Chinese people were very powerful.

But it turned out that they were just so-so.

“He had only used a little trick, and he had successfully escaped. ”

Only a coward like Jerry would be afraid of the Chinese people.

He had easily left under the eyes of the Chinese people.

And he had done it openly.

“At that moment, a cold voice came from the air. ”

“Stop.”
