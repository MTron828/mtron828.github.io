Only then did Bai Jingshu come to her senses. She snorted coldly and walked towards the exit.

“The security guard looked at Bai Mo’s back and shook his head helplessly. Nowadays, there were too many young girls who wanted to climb up the social ladder. He had been a security guard here for more than ten years and had seen many young girls who wanted to climb up the social ladder and become a phoenix, in the end, all of them died without success. ”

“Bai Mo was very angry and unwilling to give up, so he contacted Bai Yuanyuan again. ”

“Hearing that, Bai Yuanyuan said speechlessly, “Why is Bai Jingshu like this? ! Momo, I think she did it on purpose! She’s sincerely trying to make things difficult for you!” ”

“Bai Mo also knew that Bai Jingshu did it on purpose, but now, what could she do? ”

“”Yuanyuan, what should I do now?”Bai Mo asked. ”

Bai Yuanyuan narrowed her eyes. “There is a way.”

“Bai Mo immediately asked, “What Way?” ”

“”Go directly to Lin Ze,”Bai Yuanyuan said. ”

Go directly to Lin Ze?

Bai Mo was stunned.

“Bai Yuanyuan continued, “The first person Lin Ze met was you, and the first person he liked was also you. Believe me, you must still be in his heart. Since you’re already on Earth, since ye Shu’s path doesn’t work, you can only look for Lin Ze.” ”

“Under normal circumstances, Lin Ze would definitely not ignore Bai Mo.. ”

“Bai Mo hesitated for a moment before saying, “Okay.” ”

“”Oh right, Momo, don’t go just like that,”Bai Yuanyuan continued. ”

Don’t go just like that?

Bai Mo suddenly didn’t understand. “What do you mean?”

“Bai Yuanyuan continued, “What I mean is that you have to cry and find Lin Ze. Then, Lin Ze will feel sorry for you and take the initiative to stand on your side.” ”

“Bai Mo was a scheming person. When she heard this, she immediately understood what Bai Yuanyuan meant. She smiled and said, “I know what to do.” ”

Wasn’t it just acting? F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

She was the best at it.

“Bai Yuanyuan said, “Mo Mo, you can do it. Pay attention to our call time. It seems that we can only talk three times a month here. We’ve already used it twice a day.” ”

“”Okay, I’ll pay attention. I Won’t be contacting you for a while.” ”

“After cutting off the connection, Bai Mo pulled up the information she had found before and located Lin Ze’s workplace. ”

“According to the location, Lin Ze’s workplace was 30 kilometers away from here. It was definitely not suitable to walk there. ”

“However, Bai Mo did not have any means of transportation, so she could only take out the cell phone that Liu Chao had prepared for her. She made a call and asked Liu Chao to send her over. ”

“She thought that Bai Mo would be able to calm down for a period of time this time, but Liu Chao never expected that before they had even left the city, Bai Mo’s call actually came in again. ”

“Liu Chao was a little speechless, but he still picked up the call. ”

“To Bai Mo, Liu Chao was just a servant. To a servant, there was naturally no need to be polite. “Come and pick me up. I want to go to the Lin Hang Building.” ”

“Now?”Liu Chao asked.

“Bai Mo asked back, “Is there a problem?” ”

Since when did dogs have the right to question their master’s orders?

“Liu Chao immediately said, “No problem. We’ll be there right away.” ”

“After hanging up the phone, Liu Chao looked at Wu Qiang. “Qiangzi, please...” ”

“Before Liu Chao could finish his sentence, Wu Qiang waved his hand. “Got it.” ”

“After saying that, Wu Qiang continued, “But I’m really curious. who exactly is that woman to you? Why do you listen to her so much?” ”

“Liu Chao said somewhat bitterly, “She can be considered my Savior.” ”

“If it wasn’t for Bai Mo back then, she wouldn’t be the person she is now. ”

He definitely had to repay this favor.

Wu Qiang nodded. “So that’s how it is! No wonder you’re so tolerant in front of her!”

She was simply a Ninja Turtle!

Liu Chao sighed helplessly.

“Soon, the car arrived at the location Bai Mo mentioned. Liu Chao immediately got out of the car and went to Bai Mo’s side, respectfully opening the car door for her. ”

“Bai Mo did not even glance at Liu Chao, as if everything was as it should be. ”

Liu Chao sat in the passenger seat and told Wu Qiang the address.

Lin Hang Building.

The places that Bai Mo mentioned were not places that ordinary people could go to. It seemed that this woman was definitely not as simple as she looked.

“Lin Hang Building was also located in the city center. Fortunately, the traffic was still okay at this moment, and they arrived at their destination not long after. ”

Bai Mo lifted her foot and got out of the car. “You can go back first. There’s no need to follow.”

“Liu Chao was afraid that Bai Mo’s plan would change again, so he said, “Miss, why don’t I continue to follow you?” ”

“”If I tell you to go back, then you can go back. Why do you have to talk so much nonsense!”Bai Mo continued, “You’re not fit to bargain with me!” ”

It was just a dog.

“Liu Chao held back the anger in his heart and said, “Alright, then I’ll go back first. Miss Bai, if you have any problems, you can contact me.” ”

“Back in the car, Wu Qiang smiled and said, “Brother, this is the first time I’ve seen you get beaten up! This little girl is really asking for a beating!” ”

Liu Chao shook his head helplessly. “Let’s go back.”

Wu Qiang started the engine and went back.

“Bai Mo looked at her watch. There was still about half an hour before Lin Ze’s off-duty time. As long as she stood guard at the place where Lin Ze had to pass, she would definitely be able to reach Lin Ze. ”

“Although it was only half an hour, Bai Mo felt that it was even more difficult than a year. ”

“Half an hour was about to pass when she finally saw a familiar figure, ”

it was Lin Ze!

Bai Mo’s eyes lit up. She gathered her emotions and walked towards Lin Ze.

“Brother-in-law.”

“Hearing Bai Mo’s voice, Lin Ze looked up and saw Bai Mo’s face. ”

Lin Ze frowned. “What’s the matter?”

“Bai Mo’s eyes turned red. “Brother-in-law, I just came to Earth and have nowhere to go. I can’t contact my sister... I. . .” ”

“Lin Ze looked at his watch. “My Time is limited. If you have something to say, say it quickly.” ”

Bai Mo was stunned.

Her words were already so obvious. Didn’t Lin Ze understand what she meant?

She was already homeless. Shouldn’t Lin Ze’s next words be to give her a place to stay or take her home?
