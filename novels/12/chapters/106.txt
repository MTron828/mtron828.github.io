Chapter 107: 075: dinner, thousand miles of gratitude! 7

A self-deprecating look appeared in Lin Sha’s eyes.

Ye Zhuo grabbed Lin Sha’s hand. “It’s not funny, nor is it free-spirited. Only people who don’t have dreams are funny.”

Hearing this, Lin Sha suddenly remembered the scene of her attending the wonderful music anniversary party.

The people sitting next to her were all saying things that she didn’t understand.

What Finance, stocks...

At that time, she was wondering if she could understand it if she had a higher education.

Ye Zao’s words woke her up. Lin Shasha held ye Zao’s hand and said, “Zao, I’ll listen to you.”

“It’s good that you’ve figured it out, Sister Shasha.”

After figuring out what to do, Lin Shasha became relaxed.

After a five-hour flight, the two of them arrived at cloud capital.

Knowing ye Zhuo’s flight, Ye Sen had been waiting outside the airport for a long time. When he saw ye Zhuo and Lin Sha, Ye Sen came over excitedly, “Big niece! Sha Sha! This way!” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Ye Zhuo pulled the suitcase and jogged over, “Uncle.”

Lin Sha also called him uncle.

Ye Sen took the suitcase from both of them. “Let’s go home quickly.”

Ye Sen first sent Lin Sha back before driving home.

Ye Shu did not go to work today. She cooked a big table of delicious dishes at home and waited for Ye Zhuo to come back to eat.

She had not seen ye Shu for a week. As soon as she reached home, Ye Zhuo gave her a big hug. “Mom! I missed you so much!”

“Mom Misses You Too!”

Although they had only been separated for a week, it was as long as a year for the mother and daughter.

After dinner, Ye Shu took out the gifts she bought for ye Shu and Ye Sen.

Although the two of them blamed ye Zhuo for spending money recklessly, they were still very happy in their hearts.

Ye Zhuo took out the gifts that grandfather Yang had given her. “Mom, this is a gift from a patient of mine. There are some jewelry inside. You can wear it.”

“Mom is already old, why would she wear jewelry!”Ye Shu rejected with a smile. “It looks better on you young people.”

Ye Zhuo said, “Mom, How Are You Old? You’re not old at all. When we go out, people say that we’re like a pair of sisters! “Besides, I still have to go to school. Our School doesn’t allow me to wear jewelry. Most importantly, these gold bracelets and gold chains don’t look good on a student like me.”

With that said, Ye Shu agreed to accept the jewelry.

In the evening, Ye Zhuo opened the live broadcast room and prepared to broadcast chess.

As soon as she logged into her account, she discovered that her fan count had increased from 10 million to 50 million!

Furthermore, her participation in the live broadcast of Melody’s anniversary party had been edited into a video.

Currently, the number of hits on the melody platform had already exceeded 100 million!

The moment she opened the comments page, it was filled with ‘i, Ye V587! Glory World Beauty!’!

There were also many people who had previously sent black leaf a private message to apologize to Ye Zao.

Ye Zao was slightly surprised before opening the live stream.

Because she was used to not showing her face, she still did not show her face this time.

[ after watching ye Zao’s live stream of the gala, it was so beautiful! ]

[ ye Zao showed her face! ]

[ I’ve loved Yezi for 10,000 years! ]

[ user: heaven-toppling, purple-gold hammer 1225, giving away 10 sports cars! ]

[ user: that dog, giving away a sports car! ]

[ Yezi, why aren’t you showing your face again? ]

“I’m afraid that after you see my face, you won’t pay attention to my chess skills anymore!”

[ Yezi, you’re so narcissistic! But I like it so much! ]

“We can obviously rely on our looks to make a living, but our yezi has to rely on her talent!”

Ye Zhuo logged off after broadcasting for an hour.

Mu Yourong kept her eyes on the screen until ye Zhuo logged off.

Why was it that not only could ye Zhuo continue broadcasting, but she could only hide behind the screen and secretly watch!

She was not convinced!

At this moment, Mu Yourong’s phone rang.

It was her manager, Zhao Tao.

“Hello, brother Tao.”Mu Yourong picked up the phone.

“Yourong, with such a major event happening, shouldn’t you explain it on the live broadcast? Do you know that you’ve already lost twenty million fans?” Zhao Tao continued, “It’s normal for life to have some twists and turns. Moreover, these words did not come from you in the beginning! You’re also one of the victims!”

“I’m sorry, Brother Tao. My current state is not suitable for a live broadcast.”Without the attention of thousands, without beauty, and without the ability to play chess, what could she use for a live broadcast?

What to use to strengthen her fans?

Zhao Tao continued, “But you can not solve the problem by hiding like this. Silence means acquiescence! Do you know that Sitara has already gained 50 million fans!”

Mu Yourong only had 30 million fans at her peak.

Ye Zao had 50 million fans now.

Mu Yourong bit her lip. “One month! Brother Tao! At most one month! One month later, I will definitely come back! give everyone a satisfactory reply!”

One month later, grandfather Yang would definitely recover!

At that time, he would definitely thank her in Yun Jing.

After receiving old master Yang’s thanks, she would be able to gain trust points and upgrade the system.

With the help of the system, she would definitely be more dazzling than she was now!

The Mu family would also rise to a higher level with the help of the Yang family.

Brother Tao sighed, “Alright then! It’s good that you know what you’re doing.”

Time passed very quickly.

In the blink of an eye, a month had passed.

Just as Mu Yourong had thought, in this one month’s time, Old Master Yang, who was far away in the capital, had recovered very quickly.

Thus, the old man wanted to take advantage of the New Year’s Eve to come to the cloud capital and properly thank Ye Zhuo.

At that time, Ye Zhuo had left a number for old master Yang, but the old man had accidentally lost it. He only knew that ye Zhuo’s surname was ye, and that he lived in the cloud capital. He did not know her specific address.

During this period of time, Mu Yourong had also made great soldier Mu pay attention to the situation in the capital every day.

On the night of the 25th of the twelfth lunar month, soldier Mu brought back a piece of good news. “Yourong! Today, an important figure came from the capital. He said that he was looking for the Divine Doctor to repay the favor of saving his life! But...”

Speaking up to this point, soldier mu paused. “The Divine Doctor they are looking for has the surname Ye.”

Everything else matched, but the surname did not match.

Mu Yourong’s eyes lit up. After waiting for so many days, she finally received the good news. “Father, have you forgotten? My surname used to be Ye! The Divine Doctor Ye they are looking for is me!”

Old Master Yang was old, so it was normal for him to get the surname wrong. After all, her background was complicated!

Moreover, apart from her medicine, Old Master Yang had no medicine that could cure her.

Therefore, Old Master Yang was definitely here to thank her for saving his life!
