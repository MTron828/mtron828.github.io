“”Brother Si,”Zhao Xueyin shook her head and said, “It’s not worth it! It’s really not worth it!” ”

Zhao Xueyin knew lawyer si very well.

“The more she refused, the more lawyer Si wanted to help her. ”

“If she did not say anything and just accepted lawyer Si’s help, lawyer Si would definitely be suspicious. ”

“Therefore, this scene had to be acted out well! ”

“As expected, the next sentence of the lawyer was, “It’s worth it! Xueyin, I feel that whatever I do for You is worth it! In this world, no one is more worth it than you!” ”

“”Brother Si, thank you.”Zhao Xueyin could not help but cry. ”

“Silly Girl.”The lawyer walked over and hugged Zhao Xueyin.

Zhao Xueyin’s chin rested on Si Lui’s shoulder.

“From an angle that Si lui could not see, the corner of her mouth slowly curved up. ”

Father Zhao was right.

“As expected, the more spare tires, the better. ”

Especially for someone like Si lui who did not have a brain.

“After a while, Si lui released Zhao Xueyin. “Alright, Silly Girl, don’t Cry Anymore! Look at your makeup! It’s all ruined!” ”

“Zhao Xueyin wiped her face with her hand, and her tears turned into a smile. “So be it. You’re not an outsider anyway!” ”

The words ‘not an outsider’made si lui feel a surge of warmth in his heart.

It was precisely because they did not treat each other as outsiders that he was willing to do anything for Zhao Xueyin.

“After saying that, Zhao Xueyin continued, “No matter what, Big Brother Si, I have to thank you properly this time! Meeting You is the happiest thing in my life!” ”

“”The same goes for me.”The lawyer looked at Zhao Xueyin and said, “Being able to meet you is also the greatest luck in my life!” ”

Zhao Xueyin felt a little disgusted.

These words should not have been said to the lawyer.

She had no choice now.

“”Alright Xueyin, I Won’t talk to you anymore. I’ll go deal with this matter first.” ”

Zhao Xueyin personally sent the lawyer to the 57th floor.

“After Zhao Xueyin left, the lawyer went directly to the finance department to make up the remaining 30 million. Then, he wrote a review report and submitted it to the board of directors. ”

“The lawyer was demoted by five grades consecutively, from management to department manager. ”

The office moved from the 57th floor to the 30th floor.

“If not for this accident, the lawyer would have been promoted to vice president in the second half of the year. ”

Zhao Xueyin’s office.

“Although the matter had been resolved satisfactorily, the more Zhao Xueyin thought about it, the more unwilling she became. ”

“If it wasn’t for ye Zao, she wouldn’t have had to deal with the lawyer. ”

There was no need to say so many things that went against her heart.

“Zhao Xueyin turned on her computer, opened the stock market, and searched for the situation of the Jiang Corporation. ”

When she took a look.

Zhao Xueyin’s face was full of pride.

“She saw that ye Zao was so proud and had the time to find trouble with her, so she thought that the Jiang Corporation had already gotten out of trouble! ”

“Unexpectedly, not only did the Jiang Financial Group not get out of trouble, they even fell all the way to the bottom. ”

“Now, the Jiang Financial Group wanted to get up? ”

Difficult!

It was even harder than ascending to the heavens!

Just wait and see!

“How Arrogant Ye Zao was today, how regretful ye Zao would be in the future! ”

Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes.

“At that time, ye Zao wouldn’t be able to solve the problem just by kneeling down for her! ”

The mistake made by Si Lu this time wasn’t a small matter.

“The next day, the official website of the Shunxi Financial Group released the latest notice. ”

“Seeing the news of Si Lu being dealt with on the official website, the people of the Shunxi Financial Group couldn’t help but sigh. ”

Who would have thought that the usually strict chairman si would make such a low-level mistake?

He was demoted four ranks in a row!

This was too ruthless!

“Chairman Si is too unlucky!”

“”What chairman Si, I should be calling him CEO si now!” ”

“”Sigh, I thought that by reaching the 57th floor as an assistant, I would be able to get in touch with chairman si more. I didn’t expect that in less than two days, chairman Si would be demoted!” ”

“”Even if CEO Si isn’t demoted, there’s no hope for you!” ”

“What do you mean?”

“”In the entire financial group, who doesn’t know that Miss Zhao and CEO Si are the real couple!” ”

“Zhao Xueyin came to the 57th floor to look for the lawyer. When she finally remembered, the lawyer had already been transferred to the 30th floor. ”

“The lawyer was not found, but she heard these words. ”

She and the lawyer were a couple?

Who was the one who spread these words?

How could someone like the lawyer be worthy of her?

Zhao Xueyin returned to the office on the 58th floor and suppressed the anger in her heart. “Go and call the person-in-charge of the 57th floor up!”

“Okay.”Annie nodded.

“Not long after, Annie brought the person-in-charge up. ”

“”Miss Zhao, you were looking for me.” ” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Zhao Xueyin handed him a list of names. “Tell the people on the list not to come to the consortium tomorrow.”This was to make an example of the others.

People’s words were terrifying.
