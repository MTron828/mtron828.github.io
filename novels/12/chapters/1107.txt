“Zhao Xueyin was, after all, temporarily acting as the chief. ”

Ye Zhuo had only just arrived at the Shunxi Financial Group.

Although he was the president.

“In the end, he did not have real power. ”

On what basis did she let Zhao Xueyin write a self-reflection report for her?

“Are you teaching me how to Do Things?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly.

“It was a very simple six words, but it made the lawyer freeze for a moment. ”

“Before si lui could react, a sonorous and powerful voice suddenly appeared in the air. ”

“Miss ye controls 60% of the shares of the consortium! She is a descendant of the Ye family! No one here is more qualified to say this than her!”

The voice came before the person arrived.

Everyone turned around and saw elder Zhang slowly walking over.

“Elder Zhang walked directly to ye Zao’s side and said, “Not to mention Zhao Xueyin, even me and the other elders of the financial group have to listen to Miss Ye!” ”

No matter how powerful Zhao Xueyin was.

She was only temporarily acting as the first seat.

How could she compare to the actual successor?

“The lawyer wanted to say something more, but Zhao Xueyin held his wrist. ”

“At this moment, Zhao Xueyin had completely calmed down. ”

She knew that she couldn’t continue at this time.

There were too many mistakes.

What elder Zhang Said was the truth.

The Ye family owned 60% of the shares of the Shunxi Financial Group.

“In the past, it was fine if the Ye family didn’t have anyone. ”

“But now that the ye family had arrived, even if she was the interim chief, she had to listen to Ye Zhuo. ”

“Zhao Xueyin pressed down on the lawyer’s wrist without batting an eyelid and looked up at elder Zhang, “Elder Zhang, you’re right. Here, Miss Ye is the biggest shareholder and has the most say. Today’s matter is indeed my fault. I’m here to apologize to you and Miss Ye.” ”

“Speaking up to this point, Zhao Xueyin bowed slightly and then looked up at Ye Zhuo. “Miss Ye, don’t worry. I’ll definitely send the report to your office by Three o’clock Tomorrow.” ”

“At this point, Zhao Xueyin had no choice but to swallow her anger. ”

There was still a long way to go!

Just wait.

She had to return today’s humiliation to ye Zhuo ten times or a hundred times over.

If not...

She would not be a human! Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“”It’s great that you know your mistakes and can improve. Since Miss Zhao is sincerely repentant, then I’ll give you a chance.”Ye Zhuo turned his eyes slightly and his tone was a little faint, “After all, your Zhao family has worked hard in the financial group for all these years without any merit.” ”

“Without any merit, there was also distress? ”

What did this mean?

“If the Shunxi Financial Group didn’t have their Zhao family, they would have long collapsed! ”

Ye Zhuo was fine!

“He had gotten a good deal, yet he still pretended to be obedient! ”

“Zhao Xueyin held back a breath in her heart. Not only could she not let it out, she even had to maintain a smile. ”

“The elder turned to look at the crowd, then, he said, “Today is the first time Miss Ye has returned to the Shunxi Financial Group. From now on, she will be the president and chief of the Financial Group! I believe that under her leadership, our Shunxi Financial Group will definitely regain its past glory and walk to a new peak!” ”

Clap Clap Clap —

Someone in the crowd took the lead to clap.

“Then, everyone clapped as well. ”

It was deafening.

Chief?

The Chief of Shunxi Financial Group?

Zhao Xueyin glanced at ye Zhuo from the corner of her eyes.

Her eyes were filled with unwillingness.

So what if ye Zhuo was a descendant of the Ye Family?

“As long as she was here, Ye Zhuo would not be able to become the chief of Shunxi Financial Group! ”

“”Big Brother Si, let’s go.”Zhao Xueyin looked at Si lui. ”

Si lui nodded and turned around to follow Zhao Xueyin’s footsteps.

“Elder Zhang took ye Zhuo to tour around the financial group. When he saw that it was getting late, he said, “Zhuozhuo, shall I take you to the mansion?” ”

The Ye family had a mansion in the financial world.

“However, ever since elder ye went there, the Ye family mansion had been empty. ”

“Now That Ye Zhuo had returned, he naturally had to return it to its owner! ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Then I’ll have to trouble you.”

...

Zhao Xueyin’s office.

“Si lui frowned. “Xueyin, why did you swallow your anger and not let me continue?” ”

Ye Zhuo was inferior to Zhao Xueyin in everything. What right did she have to criticize Zhao Xueyin in front of her?

“”Can’t you see? Elder Zhang is on Ye Zhuo’s side. Moreover, it’s not a lie that ye Zhuo owns 60% of the shares. At this time, whatever you say is wrong!”Zhao Xueyin raised her head and looked at Si lui, “Big Brother Si, I don’t want you to suffer any grievances for me! I don’t want you to get burned because of me!” ”

“Si lui was silent. As a man, it was fine that he couldn’t protect Zhao Xueyin. ”

“On the contrary, Zhao Xueyin had to take care of him, which made him feel a little uncomfortable. ”

“Zhao Xueyin continued, “Ye Zao is killing chickens to show respect today. I underestimated my enemy too much!” ”
