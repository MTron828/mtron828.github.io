Father Zhao raised his head and looked at the photo on the roof. He frowned slightly.

Ye family’s private dishes?

Why is it ye again! Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Has he been suffering from the five elements recently?

“Master?”

The Butler called out again. Only then did father Zhao come back to his senses and followed him in.

“The moment they stepped through the door, a waiter welcomed them warmly. “This way, please.” ”

“The waiter brought the two of them to their seats and sat down. Then, he handed the plate of dishes to the butler. ”

The Butler ordered the dishes.

“Suddenly, Father Zhao’s gaze fell on a spot not far away, and his frown deepened. ”

Who was that?

Ye Sen!

What Father Zhao did not expect was that the person beside Ye Sen was actually ye Langhua.

The two of them were chatting and laughing. What a motherly and filial scene.

“Not long after, Ye Shu, who was busy, joined in the conversation. ”

“The three of them sat at the dining table, eating and chatting. The atmosphere was warm. ”

“Father Zhao was already very upset that he did not find his biological son. Now that he saw this scene, Father Zhao almost could not breathe. ”

His son was still unknown.

Why did ye Langhua have both sons and daughters?

It was blinding!

It was simply too blinding.

Father Zhao almost broke the chopsticks in his hand.

“The butler continued, “Master, why don’t We Eat at another restaurant?” ”

“No!”Father Zhao’s eyes were filled with viciousness. “We’ll eat at this restaurant!”

The Butler did not say anything more.

“Very soon, the dishes were served. ”

Father Zhao did not know the taste of the food during this meal. It was like chewing wax.

...

“When he returned to the financial world, it was already past two in the afternoon. ”

“Once father Zhao returned home, the assistant said, “Liu Sanniang has been with you all morning. Are you going to meet her or not?” ”

Liu Sanniang?

Who Was Liu Sanniang?

She was a famous matchmaker in the circle.

What could this matchmaker do?

“Hearing this, Father Zhao narrowed his eyes. “Let her in.” ”

“Okay.”The assistant nodded and turned to walk out of the door.

“Not long after, he brought Liu Sanniang in. ”

“Although Liu Sanniang was a matchmaker, she did not look like a matchmaker at all. Instead, she looked like a rich lady living in luxury. ”

Elegant and intelligent.

“Liu Sanniang walked in with a smile and said, “Old Mister Zhao.” ”

“”Sit.”Father Zhao looked at the servant and said, “Pour tea for Madam Liu.” ”

“Liu Sanniang’s husband’s surname was Liu, and his surname was also Liu. ”

“Liu Sanniang smiled and said, “You’re too polite! I don’t visit the Three Treasures Palace for no reason. I came here today because I have a joyous occasion to tell you.” ”

Joyous occasion?

What joyous occasion?

Father Zhao frowned slightly. This Liu Sanniang was a matchmaker herself.

Could it be that she wanted to be his matchmaker?

“He was already so old, how could he still need a woman. ”

“Father Zhao raised his head to look at Liu Sanniang and continued, “I appreciate madam Liu’s good intentions, but before my wife passed away, I promised her that I would never marry another person in my life. I also won’t let Xueyin call anyone else mother.” ”

“Liu Sanniang smiled and said, “The outside world has said that old Mister Zhao’s love for You is deep, and you are even more unwavering towards the late madam. Now, it seems that the rumors are indeed true! “It’s a pity that the heavens are jealous of a beautiful woman, causing her to be long gone. Otherwise, she would definitely be the happiest woman in this world.” ”

“Father Zhao took a sip of tea, looking like a good man. ”

Deep Love is unyielding?

These four words were a joke to him.

“If it wasn’t for physiological reasons, why would he keep these four words? ”

“After saying that, Liu Sanniang continued, “Old Mister Zhao, I heard that Miss Zhao is still single, right?” ”

Miss Zhao?

So Liu Sanniang was here for Zhao Xueyin.

“”Yes.”Father Zhao nodded. “I only have one daughter, and that child’s mother left early. I’m not afraid that you’ll laugh at me if I tell you this, but I really can’t bear to let her get married too early.” ”

“”The poor hearts of parents in the world. Actually, we are all the same as parents.”Speaking up to this point, Liu Sanniang’s eyeballs rolled around, then, she continued, “However, I can’t bear to part with her. As the saying goes, when a girl is old, she can’t stay. If she stays, she will become enemies. When this girl grows up, she will eventually get married. Am I right?” ”

“Father Zhao sighed, “What madam Liu said is right.” ”

“After he finished speaking, Father Zhao followed her words and continued, “Madam Liu is popular. Why Don’t you introduce a reliable person to my daughter?” ”

“If this was any other time, Father Zhao would never have opened his mouth like this. ”

“But now, things were not as they were in the past. ”

“The matter of Zhao Xueyin being thrown out of the DK Jewelry Center by the fifth master, he still had a way to suppress the heat of this matter. ”

“But last night, in front of everyone, the Ming family had chased Zhao Xueyin out of the banquet hall like she was crazy. ”
