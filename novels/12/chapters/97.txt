Chapter 98: 075: Heal and save, Brother and sister meet

“Don’t Be Rude!”Grandfather Yang said in a deep voice, “Quickly apologize to the young godly doctor.”

Yang Danian felt that grandfather Yang was sick.

And it was not light.

He actually asked him to apologize to a child.

It was simply unbelievable!

“Dad, are you sure that this child can heal you? If something happens, who will be responsible?”Compared to godly doctor Hua Tuo, Yang Danian was naturally willing to trust the godly doctor.

What was wrong with a child? DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Shut up!”After saying that, grandfather Yang turned to look at Ye Zhuo, he smiled apologetically and said, “You don’t have to take that bastard’s words to heart, young godly doctor. Since I have chosen to trust you, I will trust you to the end! “Young Godly doctor, I have already written a disclaimer. Any surgery will have risks. If there are any problems during the acupuncture process, it has nothing to do with you, Young Godly Doctor.”

What did a doctor need the most?

What he needed the most was trust!

Grandfather Yang did not want ye Zhuo to feel any pressure. Furthermore, he was already so old, so he had written a disclaimer in advance.

“Dad, you’re too muddle-headed!”Yang Danian was furious!

Grandfather Yang pointed at the door and said angrily, “Get lost!”

Seeing that grandfather Yang was really angry, Yang Danian did not dare to say anything more. He sighed and said, “Dad, I hope you don’t regret it.”

Grandpa Yang couldn’t be bothered with Yang Danian. He turned to look at ye Zhuo and said, “Little miracle doctor, when can we start the treatment?”

“Right now.”Ye Zhuo’s eyebrows remained the same.

She had always looked indifferent.

Even in the face of Yang Danian’s doubts, she wasn’t afraid.

“Okay.”Grandpa Yang continued, “Little Miracle Doctor, this way please.”

Grandfather Yang had been sick for more than a year, so the family had prepared a sterile room for treatment.

Ye Zhuo followed in grandfather Yang’s footsteps.

Outsiders were not allowed to enter the sterile room. Afraid that Lin Sha would be anxious waiting outside, the butler of the Yang family brought Lin Sha to the sunshine room to admire the flowers and watch a movie.

Lin Sha once again felt the luxury of being rich.

In the sterile room.

Grandfather Yang was lying on the hospital bed. Ye Zhuo took out the silver needles from the medical kit. “Grandfather Yang, I’m going to give you the needles soon. It Won’t hurt too much. Don’t be nervous.”

“Okay.”Grandfather Yang nodded.

The first needle was on his temple.

Ye Zhuo pinched the silver needles and slowly inserted them into the blood vessels hidden under his skin.

The winter snow shone in from the window and shone on ye Zhuo’s serious face.

It made his already fair skin even fairer.

Old Master Yang only felt a sharp pain at his temple. Then, his eyelids became heavier and heavier. In the end, he couldn’t feel anything.

Not long after.

All the acupuncture points in old master Yang’s body were filled with silver needles.

However, it wasn’t enough.

Ye Zao continued to stab the acupuncture points one after another.

Under the bright light, one could clearly see that the silver needles were slowly turning black.

Ye Zao’s forehead was also covered in a layer of sweat.

Time passed by minute by minute.

When elder Yang woke up again, the clock on the wall was already pointing to 2 pm.

It had already been five hours?

Elder Yang was stunned.

At this moment, ye Zao walked over from the side. “You’re Awake? How Do You Feel Now?”

Elder Yang sat up from the bed. “I feel...”he tried to move his muscles and bones. His arms no longer hurt and his head no longer felt dizzy!

His entire body felt very relaxed.

Ever since he got sick, he had never felt this kind of relaxed feeling.

“Young, young godly doctor, have I recovered?”Elder Yang looked at ye Zao in disbelief.

Ye Zao smiled slightly. “It can only be considered half-recovered. If you want to fully recover, you’ll need to drink some Chinese medicine for a while. This is the prescription.”

After he finished speaking, ye Zao handed the prescription that he had just written to Old Master Yang.

Old Master Yang took the prescription with both hands and was slightly stunned.

Not only was this girl’s medical skills good, her handwriting was also very beautiful.

Even an old man like him, who practiced calligraphy all year round, could not compare to her.

Sun Fu Nian was still waiting outside.

Ye Zhuo walked out to open the door.

“Little Miracle Doctor! How is Grandpa Yang?”

Ye Zhuo smiled slightly. “Grandpa Yang is already fine.”

Sun Fu Nian was very happy and immediately ran in. “Grandpa Yang!”

Grandpa Yang was so excited that tears welled up in his eyes. “Fu Nian, I know my own body very well. I’m really much better! The Little Miracle Doctor said that as long as I take some Chinese medicine for a period of time, I’ll be able to completely recover.”

“That’s great! That’s Great!”Two old men who had already passed the age of 70 hugged each other and cried bitterly.
