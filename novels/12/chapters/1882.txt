Translator: 549690339

The Miss Shuyi mentioned by the housekeeper was the only daughter of Li Yueyue’s second uncle’s family.

“She was also Li Yueyue’s cousin, Li Shuyi. ”

“Li Yueyue’s second uncle had been developing abroad, and his wife was also from C Nation. ”

“Li Shuyi was 29 years old this year, and she had been living abroad until recently. Because she had grown up abroad and was a beautiful mixed-race woman, Li Shuyi had always looked down on the native Li Yueyue. ”

She felt that she was superior to others.

“Li Yueyue was not a person who would stick a warm face to a cold butt, so she had never liked Li Shuyi very much. ” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The two sisters looked down on each other.

“Therefore, when she heard the words ‘Miss Shuyi’, Li Yueyue’s expression did not look good. ”

It was even a little ugly.

“Seeing Li Yueyue like this, father li said, “Yueyue, how dare you speak Like That! Shuyi is your cousin!” ”

Li Yueyue stuck her tongue out at father Li. “Does she look like an elder sister?”

“After saying that, father Li turned to look at ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing. “I’m sorry for making a fool out of the two of you.” ”

“Although father Li was the richest man on the grassland, and he was also a burly man, he always felt a sense of oppression in front of Cen Shaoqing. ”

Everyone in the Underworld knew Cen Fifth Master?

“However, before this, Cen Shaoqing had always been elusive. Although he had a cooperative relationship with the CEN Group, he had only heard of him and never seen him. ”

This was the first time he had seen cen fifth master in person.

Cen Shaoqing was a little different from what he had imagined.

“He had thought that Cen Shaoqing was about the same age as him, or even a little older than him. ”

“After all, CEN Shaoqing’s achievements were obvious. ”

He did not expect Cen Shaoqing to be so young.

He looked to be at most twenty-five or twenty-six years old.

What made father Li even more surprised was that his daughter’s classmate was the famous Miss Ye. He also did not expect that Miss Ye’s boyfriend was Cen Wuye!

These two people were handsome and beautiful. They were a perfect match when they walked together.

They were practically a pair of immortals!

“No worries.”Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted slightly.

“In front of outsiders, he had never spoken much. ”

“The more he acted like this, the more nervous father Li became. The weather on the prairie was obviously not to be provoked, but father Li was drenched in cold sweat. ”

“This feeling was very strange, almost involuntarily. ”

“At this moment, as they were about to pass a step, father li immediately reminded, “Fifth master, be careful of the step.” ”

“At this moment, a tall and slender young woman with three-dimensional facial features and good looks walked out from inside. “Little uncle, little aunt, you’re back.” ”

“”Shuyi.”Father Li nodded and smiled as he introduced, “This is Yueyue’s university classmate, Miss Ye. This is Miss Ye’s boyfriend, Fifth Master Cen.” ”

“Li Shuyi casually glanced at ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing, her eyes filled with disdain. ”

Birds of a feather flock together.

What kind of good friend could a person like Li Yueyue make?

“Although Beijing University was one of the top universities in the country, it was not worth mentioning abroad. ”

“If Li Yueyue was so amazing, why couldn’t she get into a top university in C Nation? ”

Li Yueyue was just an ordinary nobody. Her friends might not even be as good as her.

Such a person was not worth her greeting personally.

Because she would lower herself!

“”Uncle, I originally wanted to chat with you, but since you have an important guest at home, I Won’t disturb you anymore,”Li Shuyi said. “I’ll go back first.” ”

“Father Li said, “Shuyi, aren’t you going to sit for a while?” ”

“I’m not going to sit.”

“After saying that, Li Shuyi turned around and left. She raised her head very high, looking like she was looking down on everything in the world. ”

Li Yueyue looked at Li Shuyi’s back and angrily made a face.

Isn’t it just one-fifth of a foreigner’s bloodline?

What’s so great about it!

Does she really think that she is superior to others?

“Yueyue!”Father Li looked at Li Yueyue with a warning look in his eyes.

“Father Li was a person with a very strong sense of tradition. Although Li Shuyi had some small shortcomings, Li Yueyue was her younger sister. No matter what, her younger sister had to respect her older sister. ”

He could not stand Li Yueyue’s transgressions.

“What Li Shuyi did was wrong. With her parents in charge, it was not up to Li Yueyue, her cousin, to judge her. ”

“After receiving father Li’s warning, Li Yueyue retracted her gaze and held ye Zao’s wrist. “Da Zao Zao, let’s Go!” ”

“Father Li turned to Cen Shaoqing again. “CEN fifth master, I’m really sorry.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing’s expression was extremely indifferent. He said the same words, “It’s alright.” ”

“Father Li raised his head to look at Cen Shaoqing. He swallowed nervously and continued, “Fifth master, let’s go inside. The ground is a little slippery. Be careful.” ”
