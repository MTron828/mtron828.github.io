“With Ye Zhuo’s current state, they would be disappointed as much as they looked forward to it now. ”

“At that time, they would have to regret it. ”

“Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes and hid the expression on her face very well, she smiled and said, “Uncle Guo, you guessed correctly. It is indeed grandfather Ye’s great-granddaughter who has returned! The new President I want to introduce to all of you is also grandfather Ye’s great-granddaughter, Miss Ye.” ”

She was really a descendant of the Ye family!

It seemed that the rumors during this period of time were true.

“After he said that, the meeting room was in an uproar. ”

Some people even had tears in their eyes because of this.

It had been more than thirty years.

They had finally waited for a descendant of the Ye family.

“Thinking back to those years, when they were fighting behind grandfather Ye, they were still in their prime. ”

“Now, they had already reached their twilight years. ”

And the person who had led them to conquer this land had long since become a pile of bones.

“They had originally thought that with the Zhao family’s methods, even if they allowed the ye family’s descendants to return, they wouldn’t allow the ye family’s descendants to enter the management level. ”

“They hadn’t expected that Zhao Xueyin not only allowed ye Zao to enter the management level, but also directly gave the position of president to Ye Zao. ”

It looked like.

“All these years, they had misunderstood Zhao Zhenfei. ”

Everyone was very excited.

There was only one person whose expression was a little ugly.

This person was elder Sun.

“After all, the president that was originally set in stone was Sun Yiran. ”

“Now that it had suddenly become ye Zao, if it was anyone else, they would not be too happy. ” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Elder sun narrowed his eyes.

“Elder Guo said in a hoarse voice, “Quick, quickly let her in.” ”

Zhao Xueyin turned her gaze towards the door. “Miss Ye.”

Everyone’s eyes turned to the direction of the door.

A moment later.

A figure walked in from outside the door.

Against the light.

“It was difficult to see her face clearly, but the powerful aura around her made it impossible to ignore. ”

This aura was emitted from her bones.

It was impossible for others to copy or imitate.

“Ye Zhuo walked to the front of the stage and opened his red lips. “Hello, directors. I’m Ye Zhuo. Please take care of me in the future.”At the end, Ye Zhuo bowed slightly. ”

“Elder Guo stood up and said, “Child, how old are you this year?” ”

“”Twenty,”ye Zao answered. ”

Twenty.

“Hearing this, everyone looked at each other and saw doubt in each other’s eyes. ”

Only twenty years old.

And a child.

“However, Ye Zao was after all a descendant of the Ye family. When ye Langhua was twenty years old, she was already famous all over the world. Perhaps ye Zao was also a genius? ”

“Sometimes, age did not mean anything. ”

“Elder Sun and Zhao Xueyin, who were sitting in the crowd, looked at each other. Then, they raised their heads to look at ye Zao and asked, “Miss Ye, which school did you graduate from? What major did you study?” ”

“Ye Zao said, “I’m currently a sophomore in Beijing University, majoring in chemistry. I haven’t graduated yet.” ”

Haven’t graduated yet?

Shouldn’t a talented girl like her skip a grade?

“She skipped grade three in grade one, grade six in grade three, then went straight to high school in junior high school and then to university in grade four. ”

“According to the time calculation, Ye Zhuo should have graduated long ago. ”

Even Zhao Xueyin skipped grade three in primary school.

Could it be that ye Zhuo couldn’t even compare to Zhao Xueyin?

Most importantly...

Ye Zhuo actually studied chemistry.

A finance student studying chemistry?

How could this major match up?

“What did she know about finance, marketing, and marketing? ”

“For a moment, everyone had different expressions. ”

Could Ye Zhuo really take the lead? Lead the Shunxi Financial Group to glory?

“Everyone’s expressions were seen by Zhao Xueyin. Zhao Xueyin’s lips curved into a calm smile, then, she said, “Although sister ye Zhuo hasn’t graduated yet, she’s already a phd in science and technology at such a young age! All uncles should know about the aircraft carrier project, right?” ”

“”Aircraft Carrier Project?”Elder sun chimed in with Zhao Xueyin. “I know about this! The founder of the aircraft carrier project is Dr. YC, could it be...” ”

“That’s right.”Zhao Xueyin nodded. “Sister Ye Zhuo is Dr. YC.”

Dr. YC?

“Upon hearing this, the audience broke into a flurry of discussion. ”

They were all discussing what was going on with Dr. YC.

“An aircraft carrier that will land on the eight planets?”

“Complete the aircraft carrier project within two years?”

“...”

“At this point of discussion, the faces of the board members were a little unsightly. ”

Completing the aircraft carrier project within two years was simply a dream!

“Moreover, the financial world was completely different from the technology world. ”

“Ye Zhuo made a two-year pact in the technology world, and at the same time, he took the position of president in the financial world. ”

It is said that you can not have it both ways.

Let alone Ye’s strength.
