Ma Yue felt that this matter was a mystery.

“After all, the other party was only an earthling. ”

Old Master Bai was famous throughout his life. How could he allow his favorite granddaughter to marry an Earthling?

It was absolutely impossible!

“Bai sanfeng continued, “I heard from Miss Mo that the wedding date was set for the eighth day of next month.” ”

“Ever since she returned from the old mansion, Bai Sanfeng had been keeping in touch with Bai Mo. . ”

Bai Mo was especially good at coming to visit. She would greet Bai Sanfeng almost every day.

“So Soon?”Ma Yue asked in surprise.

“Bai sanfeng frowned and said, “The mottled toad has finally eaten the swan meat. Of course, that Earthling hopes for the best as soon as possible!” ”

“Ma Yue poured Bai Sanfeng a glass of water, “Grandma, don’t worry. I think there must be something else going on in this matter. Although cousin is older than me, she’s still just a child. Why Don’t you tell Uncle About It?” ”

“Although Ma Yue and Bai Jingshu didn’t have a very close relationship, as a cousin, she didn’t want Bai Jingshu to marry an earthling. ”

“Firstly, it was because she and Bai Jingshu were cousins. ”

“Secondly, she was afraid that others would gossip about them. ”

Having an earthling relative was not a good reputation.

“Bai Sanfeng did not want to interfere in Bai Jingzhu’s matters, but she still could not bear to see Bai Jingzhu marry an earthling. ”

“Then you wait at home. I’ll go to your uncle’s house.”Bai Sanfeng stood up from the chair.

“Ma Yue also stood up and held Bai Sanfeng’s arm. “I’ll go with you. Coincidentally, my cousin and I are of the same age. I can persuade her.” ”

“That’s fine.”Bai Sanfeng nodded.

The grandfather and grandson flew together to the Bai family’s old residence.

“These days, the news that Bai Jingshu was going to marry an earthling and that she had already set a wedding date had spread throughout the entire s galaxy. The servants of the Bai family were also talking about it. ”

“They felt that there was something wrong with Bai Jingshu’s brain, and they also felt that old master Bai had become muddle-headed due to his old age. ”

“The moment Bai Sanfeng got off the aircraft, the Butler walked over respectfully. “Third aunt, Miss Cousin.” ”

Bai Sanfeng glanced at the butler. “Is your old master at Home?”

“”Yes.”The Butler knew that this third aunt was not someone to be trifled with, so he continued, “Please Wait a moment, I’ll go look for old master right away.” ”

“No need.”Bai Sanfeng raised her hand. “I’ll go look for him myself.”

“Ma Yue continued, “Then I’ll go look for cousin.” ”

“Mm.”Bai Sanfeng nodded.

The grandfather and grandson split into two groups.

“Very soon, Bai Sanfeng arrived at Old Master Bai’s study. ”

“Old Master Bai was practicing calligraphy in the room when he suddenly heard a cold voice. “What time is it now, and you still have the mood to practice calligraphy! Do you still see Jingshu as your biological granddaughter? !” ”

Elder Bai immediately put down his pen and looked up at Bai Sanfeng. “Sis.”

Bai Sanfen’s face was stern. “I heard that Jingshu’s wedding date has already been decided?”

“Yes.”Elder Bai nodded.

“Bai sanfeng continued, “What if I don’t agree?” ”

“Elder Bai put away the words he had written and looked at Bai Sanfeng. “Elder SIS, please believe me this once. Jingshu will definitely not be wronged by marrying Lin Ze.” ”

Elder Bai did not look down on Lin Ze’s identity as an Earthling at all.

What was wrong with an Earthling?

“Although the s galaxy was technologically advanced, it was not half as humane as Earth. ”

“What kind of grandfather are you!”Bai Sanfeng looked at elder Bai. “Do you really want Jingshu to follow your old path?”

The Bai family seemed to have an unbreakable curse on them.

It was that their descendants would definitely fall in love with the Earthlings.

“Old Master Bai was like this, she was like this, and now Bai Jingshu was like this. ”

“However, she and Old Master Bai were lucky enough to not be doubted by the Earthlings. ”

Bai Jingshu was a little incredulous. She could actually make the decision to marry an earthling!

“”Sifeng, you’ve experienced this kind of thing before. Think about it. If you hadn’t stopped at the precipice in time, would you still have the life you have now?”wasn’t it good to find a person of equal status and treat them with respect for the rest of their lives? ”

“Hearing this, Old Master Bai turned to look at Bai San Feng and said seriously, “Third sister, do you know that all these years, I’ve been regretting it?”He regretted why he had to compromise. ”

He regretted why he hadn’t been bolder back then.

“If he had resisted back then, he definitely wouldn’t have ended up like this. ” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“What do you regret?”Bai San Feng’s face was full of disbelief. “I think you’re Crazy!”
