“CEN yuying said, “I have skin care products that can quickly recover from sunburn. The effect is not bad. You can bring them to your sister-in-law tomorrow.” ”

The next day.

Cen Shaoqing went to the school to pick up ye Zao.

They had not seen each other for more than ten days.

“Seeing ye Zao now, Cen Shaoqing had the urge to hug her into his arms. The blood in his body was boiling and burning, but he still did not dare to do so. ”

He was terrified.

“After all, he was just a lowly intern. ”

Cen Shaoqing restrained the impulse in his heart and tilted his head slightly. “There’s some Iced Yang Zhi sweet dew in the fridge. Grandma specially asked me to get it for you.”

Ye Zhuo’s eyes lit up and he opened the door of the car refrigerator.

“Sure enough, he saw a cup of Yang Zhi sweet dew. ”

Not long after.

The car stopped at the Cen family’s manor.

“Almost as soon as the car stopped, the housekeeper came in to announce, “They’re here, they’re here! Fifth Master is back!” ”

“”Really?”The three CEN family sisters immediately stood up from the sofa, extremely excited. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen then instructed them to remain calm and said, “Why isn’t that fourth girl back yet? Yuying, have you notified her?” ”

Cen Yuying nodded. “I’ve informed the fourth girl. She said that she’ll be back today.”

At this moment.

The sound of footsteps was getting closer and closer.

“Then, two figures appeared at the door of the living room. ”

Everyone looked up and saw a girl standing beside Cen Shaoqing.

“She was standing right beside Cen Shaoqing. Her porcelain-white face seemed to be covered in a layer of snow light. There was a hint of clarity in her bright beauty, but there was also a hint of uneasiness in her clarity. ”

The Golden and resplendent living room was forcefully made into a backdrop by her.

Her beautiful facial features were still wrapped in the cold of winter.

She was unapproachable.

This temperament was emitted from her bones. No one else could replicate it.

“Yezi!”Old Mrs. Cen rushed over and hugged ye Zhuo.

“Grandma Cen.”

“Old Mrs. Cen said with a straight face, “You still call me Grandma Cen?” ”

“Grandma.”Ye Zhuo immediately changed the way he addressed her.

“Old Lady Cen smiled and said, “Hey! That’s more like it!” ”

Not Black.

Not Black at all.

“At first, Cen Yueya thought that she was going to meet a black sister. She did not expect that her future sister-in-law would actually be so good-looking. ”

So good-looking that she was about to cry!

“Cen Yueya walked in front of ye Zhuo and tried her best to suppress the excitement in her heart. “This is your future sister-in-law, right? Hello, I’m Shaoqing’s second sister, Cen Yueya. You can just call me second sister.” ”

“”Hello, second sister. I Am Ye Zao,”ye Zao greeted politely. ”

Cen Yueya held ye Zao’s hand and sighed in her heart. A beauty was indeed a beauty. Even her hands were so soft.

“How convenient for that Monk, Cen Shaoqing! ”

“”Zao Zao, let me introduce you. This is our eldest sister and this is third sister.” ”

Ye Zao greeted them one by one.

“Although Cen Yuying and Cen Yueying had been prepared for ye Zao to be very good-looking, they did not expect ye Zao to be so good-looking. They were so surprised that they did not even know where to place their hands. ”

“CEN yuying said, “Zao Zao, take a seat. You Don’t have to be so formal with us sisters.” ”

Old Madam Cen looked at the performance of her granddaughters with satisfaction.

“Zhou Xiang came in with a plate of cut fruits. “Zao Zao, this is the lotus mist that was flown in this morning. Have a taste of it.” ”

“”Thank you, Aunt Xiang.” ”

“Cen Yueya smiled and said, “We are all family. Why are you being so polite?” ”

“The CEN sisters were very easy to get along with, so it was not stressful for ye Zhuo to be with them. ” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Perhaps it was because he had eaten too much fruit, but after a while, ye Zhuo felt a little unwell and tugged at Cen Shaoqing’s clothes. ”

Cen Shaoqing looked down at Ye Zhuo and moved closer to her ear. “What’s Wrong?”

“I want to go to the bathroom.”Ye Zhuo raised his eyes slightly and lowered his voice.

The way the two of them were whispering to each other was very intimate in the eyes of everyone.

“Cen Yueya pretended to talk to Cen Yuying, but in fact, she raised her head and looked up a few times. ”

Cen Shaoqing grabbed her hand and took her to the washroom.

“After the two of them left, CEN Yueya asked curiously, “Mom, Grandma, what did you say that sister-in-law just said to Shaoqing?” ”

“CEN yueying said speechlessly, “Second sister, Why Are You So Nosy?” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen said excitedly, “Isn’t it the nature of us little girls to gossip? I’m also quite curious!” ”

Cen Yueying:”...”

At this moment.

The sound of footsteps sounded again in the air.

Cen Yueya thought that ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing had returned. She looked up and saw that two young women of equal stature had entered.

“One of them had short hair, exquisite facial features, and a heroic air. Zhou Xiang’s shadow could be seen between her eyebrows and eyes. ”
