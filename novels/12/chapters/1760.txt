Translator: 549690339

“The next second, Feng Ying’s face turned pale. ”

Because the old lady had no breath in her nose.

She was dead.

The old lady was really dead.

Feng Ying lost her balance and fell to the ground again.

“Just then, the sound of an ambulance came from outside the door. ”

It was sharp and urgent.

“It’s here, it’s finally here! ”

She’s saved!

Feng Ying’s eyes lit up.

“But at this moment, a large amount of blood gushed out from her throat. Her heart seemed to be blocked by something. She couldn’t breathe or speak. ”

This feeling was very uncomfortable!

“However, Feng Ying’s consciousness was still very clear. was she really going to die? ”

“Feng Ying’s pupils gradually dilated, and her entire body seemed to be on fire. ”

“In the next second, Feng Ying’s vision began to slowly turn black, until she could not see the scene in front of her at all... ”

Bang.

“In the next second, the door of the villa was broken into from the outside. ”

The noise of footsteps could be heard.

120!

It was 120.

120 doctors came to save her.

“At this moment, Feng Ying still had her hearing and consciousness, but she could not open her eyes. She did not even have the strength to move her fingers. ”

The doctors in white coats walked to Feng Ying and the old lady respectively. “Ms. Feng! May I ask if you’re here?”

“Ms. Feng!”

“The patient did not respond. Her pupils began to dilate and her heartbeat disappeared. Prepare for defibrillation!”

“Yes.”

A nurse immediately assisted in defibrillation.

“After a series of emergency measures, Feng Ying and the old lady still did not respond. Helplessly, the doctor had no choice but to declare her dead. ”

“There was no one else in the villa other than Feng Ying and the old lady, so 120 called the police. ”

“After all, when Feng Ying dialed 120, she clearly informed the operator that she had been poisoned and that this matter had to be passed through the police. ”

“Soon, the police arrived and set up a cordon around the villa. ”

The police initially concluded that it was the grandmother who had poisoned Feng Ying.

This matter immediately became a hot topic in all the major news sections.

Grandmother had poisoned her own granddaughter?

How much hatred was this?

“For a moment, curses were everywhere at night, all for Feng Ying’s injustice. ”

“However, there were also some relatively calm netizens. ”

“[ everyone, be reasonable. The old lady is already 89 years old. I believe that she must have had her own reasons for doing this. ] ”

[ a tiger does not eat its own son. How much hatred and hatred does she have to make her poison her own granddaughter? ]

[ I’ve checked. The deceased’s name is Feng Ying. Her English name is Katherine. She’s a fashion designer. She just joined the International Fashion Department! ]! [ she thinks she’s a talented woman! ]! [ I don’t know what kind of grudge there is between the grandfather and grandson that made the old man do this to her. But I know that people who can join the international fashion department are definitely not the kind of people with bad conduct. ]

It was not that easy to enter the international fashion department.

Ability and character were all within the scope of the review!

“Therefore, there should be no problem with Feng Ying’s character. If there was a problem with her character, she would not be qualified to join the international fashion department. “I think it should be like this. The old man found out that he had a terminal illness and knew that he would die soon. He was afraid of death, so he reached out to his own granddaughter!” ”

“”If that’s really the case, then it’s too scary!” ”

“I think the analysis above is very reasonable. There are too many cases like this. Selfish people don’t care about blood and family.”

[ hell is empty. The Devil is in the human world! It’s a pity that Feng Ying is 32 years old. She’s at the peak of her career. ]

[ having such a vicious wolf grandmother is a tragedy in life! ] Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

[ everything is fine in heaven. ]

Poor Old Lady Feng Shujing. People were still speculating about her.

“As a traitor, Feng Ying was remembered and mourned by the people. ”

“After many netizens learned about this, they went to the Feng family’s villa to offer flowers and offerings. ”

Some even invited a master from the temple to help Feng Ying cross over.

“There was also a wooden board with the old lady’s name written on it. It was graffiti, rotten eggs, and rotten vegetable leaves. ”

It was a stark contrast to Feng Ying on the side.

...

“On the other side, at the CEN Group’s base. ”

Cen Hu held his phone and Strode towards the laboratory.

“Miss Ye! Miss Ye!”

“What happened?”Ye Zhuo looked back slightly and looked at Cen Hu.

“Cen Hu was running out of breath. “Miss Ye, something... Something Happened!” ”

“”What happened? Speak Slowly.”Ye Zhuo handed the information in his hand to his assistant and said, “Go and get a glass of water for team leader Cen.” ”
