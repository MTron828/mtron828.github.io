“Ye Sen’s injury was very serious, and blood was flowing from his forehead. ”

“At this time, he had already fallen into a coma. ”

Cen Shaoqing immediately ordered the bodyguards to carry him to the car.

“”Go to the nearest hospital,”Cen Shaoqing instructed the driver in the front seat. ”

“Okay.”

“The car was very fast, and they arrived at the hospital in a short while. ”

...

“When Ye Sen woke up, his nose was filled with the pungent smell of medicine. His vision was a vast expanse of whiteness, and his throat was so dry that it was about to smoke. It was very uncomfortable. ”

A figure was sitting by the bed.

“His left hand was holding a string of Buddhist beads, and his right hand was flipping through a Buddhist scripture — ”

Prajna scripture

“As he flipped through the book, he could smell a faint sandalwood fragrance. It was very nice. ”

Where was he?

Ye Sen was stunned and reached out to pinch his temple.

“He remembered that it was already very late when he went back last night after negotiating with party A’s father. He thought nothing would happen, but he was suddenly attacked by a few people from country P. ”

“Later, his head exploded. ”

“Just as he thought he would die on the streets of country P, a strong light hit him. ”

“Then, he fainted. ” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

So...

He was saved?

“Ye Sen frowned. If he remembered correctly, it should be like this. ”

“So, who was the person who saved him? ”

“At this moment, the man sitting by the bed put down the Buddhist scripture in his hand and looked over with concern. “Mr. Ye, you’re awake. How are you feeling now? Do you want to drink some water?” ”

This... This was Cen Shaoqing?

“So, the person who saved him was Cen Shaoqing? ”

“I. . .”

“Ye Sen looked at Cen Shaoqing. Before he could react, Cen Shaoqing handed him a spoon of water. ”

Ye Sen subconsciously opened his mouth to take the water.

The clear water entered his throat and eased the burning sensation in his throat. It was as if the dry and cracked Earth was in the midst of spring rain. It was very comfortable.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Mr. Ye, you don’t have to worry. The Doctor said that the wound on your head isn’t very deep, but there’s a slight concussion. You’ll need to stay in the hospital for three days to be discharged.” ”

Ye Sen was like an emotionless drinking machine.

He took mouthfuls of water from Cen Shaoqing.

“He never expected that the person who saved him was Cen Shaoqing, this big pig trotter. ”

It seemed that Cen Shaoqing was not as bad as he had imagined.

He had thought that Cen Shaoqing was a playboy with bad conduct.

“But if Cen Shaoqing was really a playboy, he would not have risked his life to save him. ”

“After all, this was country P. ”

“For a moment, ye Sen felt very complicated. He raised his head and looked at Cen Shaoqing. “Mr. , Mr. Cen, You Saved Me?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing continued to feed him water. “You’re an elder. Just call me by my name, or Xiao Cen.” ”

“Ye Sen licked his lips. “Then Xiao Cen, you didn’t tell Zhuozhuo about this, right?” ”

“”No,”Cen Shaoqing answered. ”

“Ye Sen heaved a sigh of relief. “That’s good! Don’t tell them about it. It’s not a big problem for me, lest they worry blindly in the country!”Ye Zhuo had warned him a long time ago, country P had been rather chaotic recently. He had not taken it to heart. ”

“If ye Zhuo found out about this, given her personality, she would definitely fly over to country P. ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Okay.”

“Ye Sen looked at Cen Shaoqing. He felt that this person was not as unpleasant as before. “Little Cen, thank you for saving me.” ”

“Thinking about his previous actions, Ye Sen felt rather embarrassed. ”

“Fortunately, Cen Shaoqing did not argue with him. ”

“Otherwise, with the current situation, his life would probably be lost in country P. ”

“”It’s my duty.”Cen Shaoqing’s tone was indifferent. He continued, “Since last night, you must be hungry, right? What do you want to eat? I’ll get someone to send it over.” ”

“”Don’t bother, I’m not hungry.”Ye Sen was embarrassed to trouble Cen Shaoqing again. ”

Cen Shaoqing was not a talkative person. He picked up his phone and sent a message to his assistant.

“Not long after, there was a knock on the door outside the ward. ”

“Come in.”Cen Shaoqing stood up from the sofa and tidied up his clothes.

“The assistant came in with a lunch box and placed the food on the table. “Master Five, this is the lunch you asked me to prepare. This is for you and this is for Mr. Ye.” ”

Ye Sen’s lunch was very rich.

“There was pig’s foot soup, steamed bass, shiitake mushrooms, cabbage, and braised pork. Ye Sen had been in country P for three days and had eaten western food. When he suddenly saw such authentic Chinese food, he was so excited that he swallowed his saliva. ”

Fragrant!

It was too fragrant.

Then he looked at Cen Shaoqing’s side.

What was that Green Plate?

Grass?

Ye Sen frowned slightly.
