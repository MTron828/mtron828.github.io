“Chapter 836: 183: Little Half Moon is still alive, a worthless trinket! 2”

Translator: 549690339

“After Little Half Moon went missing, Ye Langhua’s hair turned white overnight. ”

No one knew how desperate she was in her heart.

She wanted to die but didn’t dare.

She had to face pain while living.

Aunt Lang lowered her head to wash the vegetables.

Drip —

“A tear fell into the clear water, rippling in circles. ”

“Xiao Mei walked over and asked, “Aunt Lang, are you cooking noodles for Miss Weiyue?” ”

“MMM.”Aunt Lang nodded. “Weiyue said she wants to eat spring noodles?”

“”Spring noodles?”Xiao Mei frowned. Shouldn’t she eat longevity noodles on her birthday? Then, she said, “Why don’t I go and order a cake for Miss Weiyue?” ”

Order a cake?

Aunt Lang was stunned. “Why do you want to order a cake?”

“Xiao Mei looked at Aunt Lang. “Aunt Lang, did you forget that today is Miss Weiyue’s Birthday?” ”

“Only then did Aunty Lang realize that today was not only Xiao Banyue’s birthday, it was also Xi Weiyue’s birthday. Not only did the two of them look alike, even their birthdays were the same day. ”

Aunty Lang had always thought that it was fate.

It was Xiao Banyue and XI Weiyue’s Sisterhood. Little did she know that this was all an illusion arranged by Xi Muwen. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“When she remembered that today was Xi Weiyue’s birthday.., aunt Lang said with some annoyance, “Look at my memory. I’ve forgotten about this! Xiao Mei, go and buy a cake now! Give me the invoice later and I’ll settle it with your salary.” ”

“Xiao Mei nodded and jogged out. “Okay, I’ll go now.” ”

“After Xiao Mei left, Aunt Lang took out the Yangchun noodles that she had prepared. ”

“Aunt Lang came to the entrance of the alley outside the shop. When she walked out of the alley, it was a bustling business district. ”

“Zhou Mai.”

A middle-aged woman heard the voice and walked out from the green belt. “Aunt Lang.”

“This is the Yangchun noodles that just came out of the pot. Eat It while it’s hot.”

“Zhou Mai took the bowl with both hands. “Thank you, Aunt Lang.” ”

“Zhou Mai had been wandering around the area for more than three years and had always relied on Aunt Lang to provide for her. If it wasn’t for Aunt Lang, she would have starved to death long ago. ”

“Aunt Lang wiped her hands on the apron. The Tears on her face had long disappeared, “You’re welcome. My noodles are also leftovers from other guests. I’ll go back first. If you don’t have enough, just look for me. We’ve known each other for three years. You Don’t have to be polite with me.” ”

“Okay.”Zhou Mai nodded.

Aunt Lang walked back.

“Back in the kitchen, Auntie Lang started to make longevity noodles. ”

“The longevity noodles were made from a single strand of noodles. Although the process was simple, it required careful attention. Once there was a mistake, it had to be restarted. ”

“An hour later, a bowl of fragrant longevity noodles was ready. ”

“Coincidentally, Xiao Mei came back with the birthday cake. ”

Xiao Mei called the other two employees and the four of them went to the hall to celebrate Xi Weiyue’s birthday.

“”Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday to you...”the four of them sang the birthday song as they walked. ”

Xi Weiyue was looking down at her phone when she was suddenly attracted by the song. She looked up and saw a few people walking over with the birthday cake.

Very cheap birthday cake.

“It was estimated to be less than 1,000 yuan. ”

Who Was Xi Weiyue?

“She was the daughter of the Xi family. Her birthday cakes were all custom-made in a high-end cake shop. A cake was worth at least six figures, or else she would not even be interested in it. ”

But today.

Ye Langhua actually tried to fool her with this kind of low-quality cake.

This kind of cake was eaten by poor people. How could it be worthy of her noble status?

“Xi Weiyue was very angry, but a smile appeared on her face. Her eyes were filled with surprise as she covered her mouth with her hands. ”

“”Miss Weiyue, Happy Birthday!” ”

“Thank you.”Xi Weiyue bowed excitedly. “Thank you.”

“Aunt Lang put it on Xi Weiyue’s head with her own hands. “Weiyue, Happy Birthday.” ”

“”Thank you, Aunt Lang.”Xi Weiyue hugged Aunt Lang, her eyes red and almost teary. ”

“Silly child.”Aunt Lang hugged Xi Weiyue as if she was hugging the Little Half Moon. The corners of her mouth were full of smiles. “Why are you still so polite with me?”

“Xiao Mei and the other three employees lit the candles on the cake. “Miss Weiyue, come over and blow out the candles and make a wish.” ”

Xi Weiyue sniffled and tried her best not to let her tears fall. She looked like she wanted to cry but did not. It was more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people.

“Xiao Mei helped Xi Weiyue to the birthday cake. “Miss Weiyue, it’s your birthday today. Don’t cry anymore. Hurry up and make a wish.” ”

“”MMM.”Xi Weiyue wiped her tears and the corners of her mouth curled up into a smile. She put her hands together and made a wish. Then, she slowly said, “I hope Auntie can find Sister Half Moon soon. By heaven, if Auntie can find Sister Half Moon, I, Xi Weiyue, am willing to lose ten to twenty years of my life.” ”
