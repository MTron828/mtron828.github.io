“Chapter 767: 171: No. 1! 3, fought over by a few big shots”

Translator: 549690339

Could it be that she was going to say that she did not understand ye Zhuo?

She was now a mute who could not say anything.

“Han Zhen smiled apologetically at Ye Zhuo. “Miss Ye, you’re exaggerating. I should be the one apologizing to you. It’s me who did not consider your feelings beforehand.””

“As the President of the literary association, Han Zhen could only apologize.”

Only by apologizing could those who were trying to redress ye Zhuo’s grievances be appeased.

Seeing this scene.

Wang Zhishu and Sun Openg were dumbfounded.

They had thought that ye Zhuo had used a backdoor to become master Yu’s disciple.

“But now, it seemed that the situation was completely different.”

Ye Zhuo was a genius!

“If he wasn’t a genius, how could he solve the problem in three languages at the same time?”

Wang Zhishu and Sun Openg looked at each other and saw shock and disbelief in each other’s eyes.

“Zheng zikai smiled and said, “Do the two of you still think that miss ye relied on her connections to enter the literary world through the back door?””

Sun Openg gulped and his face turned red. He did not know how to speak.

Zheng Zikai looked at Wang Zhishu. “What About You?”

Wang Zhishu immediately lowered his head.

“If she had known that ye Zao was so powerful, she definitely wouldn’t have looked down on Ye Zao.”

It had to be said.

Ye Zao had done President Shuhai a great favor this time.

“The head examiner held the microphone and smiled. “Miss Ye, as the only person in the past 15 years who has obtained a full score in the assessment competition, it’s not too much to call you a genius. May I ask if you have any experience to share with everyone?””

“Ye Zhuo leaned slightly and opened her red lips slightly. “No one is born a genius. If a genius really exists, then a genius is 99% perspiration and 1% inspiration.””

It was a very light sentence.

But it contained a bunch of philosophy of life.

It was also the most annoying thing to share the acceptance speech with others.

“In her opinion, all success required perspiration.”

“One minute on the stage, ten years of hard work below the stage.”

“When she saw the bright and beautiful surface, she also needed to see the sweat behind her back.”

As soon as she said this.

The audience immediately burst into deafening applause.

It was very intense.

“After ye Zhuo took the trophy that belonged to the first place, he walked down the stage.”

“”Please wait a moment.”Just as ye Zhuo walked down the stage, a very low female voice suddenly appeared in the air.” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Ye Zao turned his head slightly and saw a girl with long curly hair.

“You’re calling for me?”

“The girl with long curly hair nodded. “Yes! My name is Zhao Tong. Can We Be Friends?”As soon as she finished speaking, Zhao Tong extended her hand towards ye Zao.”

Zhao Tong was a complete beauty lover.

“Ever since ye Zao appeared on the first day of the assessment, she had been paying attention to ye Zao.”

“However, at that time, there were too many rumors about ye Zao. She did not dare to take the initiative to look for ye Zao.”

“Now that it was proven that ye Zao did not use any backdoor methods and did not cheat during the assessment, Zhao Tong could not wait to look for ye Zao.”

“Ye Zao smiled and reached out to shake Zhao Tong’s hand. “Ye Zao, it’s nice to meet you.””

Zhao Tong was extremely excited. “Then can we add each other on wechat?”

“Yes.”

“Then I’ll add you!”Zhao Tong immediately took out her phone.

“After adding wechat, Ye Zao returned to his original seat.”

“Not long after he sat down, Zheng Zikai called him to master Yu’s side.”

“Master.”

“Master Yu looked at Ye Zao, his eyes filled with satisfaction. “Zao Zao, Congratulations!”Although he knew that ye Zao would definitely not let him down, master Yu was still very surprised to see ye Zao score full marks.”

“At the beginning of the assessment, he had also received a test paper.”

“According to the difficulty of the test, master Yu felt that it was already very good if ye Zao could get more than 90 points.”

“After all, if he was asked to do this test paper, he might not even get full marks.”

One had to know.

The second-place student had only gotten 89.5 points.

He did not even get 90 points.

“Moreover, ye Zao had even handed in his test paper two hours earlier.”

This meant that ye Zao didn’t take the three sets of papers seriously at all.

It was simply impossible to imagine just how terrifying this person’s strength was.

“Master Yu continued, “I’ll bring you to our sea of books meeting now. At the same time, I’ll recognize you.””

Ye Zao hesitated for a moment. “Now?”

“Master Yu saw the hesitation in ye Zao’s eyes and continued, “Don’t worry. I’ll get someone to arrange for your two friends.””

Ye Zao nodded. “I’ll go and greet them now.”

“Okay.”

Ye Zao came to an Lizi and Zhao Pingting’s side.

The two people that master Yu had arranged had already come to an Lizi and Zhao Pingting’s side.
