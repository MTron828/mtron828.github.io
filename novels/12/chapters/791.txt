“”Grandma, what’s Going On?”Feng Xianxian looked at Old Lady Lin in disbelief. ”

“Old Lady Lin smiled and said, “After Grandpa Zhou heard about my matter, he withdrew his capital with the other four old shareholders! If that unfilial son doesn’t come and beg for my forgiveness, then the company will be buried in his hands!” ”

Could Lin Jincheng watch helplessly as the Lin group collapsed?

Definitely not.

“Hearing this, Feng Xianxian’s eyes flashed with a faint light, but she frowned. “Grandma, isn’t it a little bad for you to do this? After all, Uncle Lin isn’t targeting you. He just doesn’t want me to go back with you...” ”

“Feng Xianxian looked like she was exonerating Lin Jincheng, but she was actually adding fuel to the fire. ”

“Old Lady Lin held Feng Xianxian’s hand, “Xianxian, you are my biological granddaughter. If he is targeting you, he is targeting me! Wait! This time, I must let them know who is the real master of the Lin Family! Otherwise, they will never know the immensity of Heaven and Earth!” ”

“Feng Xianxian was very touched and said, “Grandma, thank you for being so good to me.” ”

“Old Madam Lin patted Feng Xianxian’s hand. “Silly child, good is mutual. I’m only good to you if you’re good to me!”She was not blind. Feng Xianxian was not like that ingrate ye Zhuo! ”

“Feng Xianxian was sensible, kind, and filial. Old Madam Lin always felt that she had accumulated great virtue in her past life to be able to meet such an obedient and filial granddaughter like Feng Xianxian in this life. ”

Feng Xianxian’s lowered eyes were full of pride.

“According to this development, in less than three days, Lin Jincheng would have to come and pick them up obediently. ” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

At that time.

She would still be the eldest daughter of the Lin family.

Ye Zhuo?

What was Ye Zhuo?

So what if she had the blood of the Lin family flowing in her body?

She would still not be able to win Old Lady Lin’s favor.

“After all, in the Lin family, the person who held great power was Old Lady Lin. ”

This old lady of the Lin family was also so stupid that she was cute.

She would rather believe an outsider like her than ye Zhuo.

“From this, it could be seen how much of a failure ye Zhuo had been. ”

The smug look in Feng Xianxian’s eyes became even more intense.

“Old Lady Lin continued, “Xianxian, I still have some cash here. Let’s go to the supermarket later and buy some wine to celebrate.” ”

“Okay.”Feng Xianxian nodded.

“In the evening, in order to celebrate, Feng Xianxian personally cooked a table full of food. ”

“Before going to bed, Feng Xianxian specially went to take a look at the situation of the LIN Group’s stock market. ”

“Seeing that the LIN Group’s stock market kept falling, Feng Xianxian felt much more at ease. ”

“It seemed that when she woke up the next morning, she would see Lin Jincheng’s regretful face. ”

The next morning.

Feng Xianxian woke up early. She originally thought that she would be able to see Lin Jincheng after breakfast.

However.

“Until the afternoon, there was no movement from Lin Jincheng’s side. ”

“Logically speaking, because of the withdrawal of the shareholders, the LIN Group should have been in chaos by now. ”

Lin Jincheng was not anxious at all?

Was he not afraid that the LIN Group would fall?

Could it be that the LIN Group had encountered a turning point?

Or could it be that Cen Shaoqing had stepped in to help?

“Although the LIN Group had too big of a capital hole and could not be easily closed, to CEN Shaoqing, it was just a matter of a word. ”

Could it be Cen Shaoqing?

Feng Xianxian bit her lip.

Logically speaking.

Cen Shaoqing should not have stepped in to help.

Because he was not sincere towards ye Zao at all.

He just wanted to play with ye Zao.

A man would only play with a woman. He would only add insult to injury and would not help her in time of need.

“But there was still no movement from Lin Jin city, which made Feng Xianxian a little worried. ”

What if...

What if Cen Shaoqing helped?

“Feng Xianxian narrowed her eyes and immediately turned on the computer. When she saw that the shares of the LIN Group on the stock market had been red all the way to the end, she heaved a sigh of relief. ”

Fortunately.

“Fortunately, CEN Shaoqing did not lend a hand. ”

“If Cen Shaoqing really lent a hand, then the shares of the LIN Group would not be red. ”

It seemed that her guess was right. Cen Shaoqing was only fooling around with Ye Zao.

“If Cen Shaoqing really loved ye Zao, would cen Shaoqing not have any reaction when the LIN Group was severely damaged? ”

A person like Cen Shaoqing should be worthy of her!

What was ye Zao?

A bastard who only knew how to snatch other people’s things!

Shameless!

Feng Xianxian clenched her fists.

“This time, she would definitely make ye Zao return the things that he had stolen from her, with interest. ”

Another Day passed in the blink of an eye.

There was still no movement from Lin Jin city.
