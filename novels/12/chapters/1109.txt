“Elder Zhang smiled and said, “Searing hot, I don’t know what style you like, so I didn’t get anyone to touch the decorations here. I’ll get the designer to come over tomorrow, and you can tell her yourself.” ”

“Young people nowadays had unique tastes, so elder Zhang couldn’t make any decisions on his own. ”

Ye searing looked around at the decorations in the mansion. “There’s no need to get the designer to come over. It’s pretty good like this.”

Elder Zhang nodded. “Alright!”

“Just then, a middle-aged woman walked in from outside. ”

“Elder Zhang.”

“Elder Zhang continued, “Zhuo Zhuo, this is the housekeeper of the mansion, Auntie Lin. Auntie Lin, this is elder Ye’s great-granddaughter.” ”

“”Hello, Miss Ye.”Auntie Lin bowed respectfully. “In the future, if you need anything, just tell me directly.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Then I’ll have to trouble Auntie Lin in the future.”

“This is what I should do.”

“Elder Zhang looked out of the window and continued, “Zhuozhuo, I’ll go back first. If there’s anything, just call me.” ”

“I’ll send you off.”

“You don’t have to send me off. I can leave by myself.”

“Although elder Zhang said that there was no need to send him off, Ye Zhuo still sent him out of the door. ”

“After taking a few steps, elder Zhang seemed to have remembered something and continued, “Oh Right, Zao Zao, on the night of the 26th, I organized a welcoming banquet for you at the International Building of the Financial Center...” ”

“Ye Zao had never had the heart to handle these banquets. “Elder Zhang, actually, there’s no need to be so grand.” ”

“Elder Zhang smiled and said, “I invited the most experienced dessert chef in the financial center, one that no one can hire even if they spend money.” ”

“Really?”Ye Zao’s eyes lit up.

“”Of course it’s true! In order to invite this desserts, I did a lot of things! In the end, if I didn’t use my connections, I really wouldn’t have been able to invite him.”Knowing that ye Zao liked this type of thing.., therefore, elder Zhang specially invited this heavyweight desserts. Now, it seemed that this decision was really correct. ”

“Ye Zao said with a smile, “Then on the night of the 26th, I will definitely be there on time.” ”

“”Okay, okay, okay!”Elder Zhang nodded hurriedly. “Then I’ll say it!” ”

The next day.

At nine o’clock in the morning.

Ye Zhuo arrived at Shunxi Financial Group on time to clock in.

Today was her first day at work.

“Just as she arrived at work, her secretary sent over a pile of documents. “Hello, President Ye. I’m President Yu’s former secretary, Ally. These are all documents that need your approval.” ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Put them over there.”

Ally placed the documents on her desk.

Ye Zhuo picked up one of the documents and looked at it. He raised his eyebrows slightly. “Wait a moment.”

“”President Ye, do you have any other instructions?”Ally stopped in her tracks and turned around to look at Ye Zhuo. ”

“Ye Zhuo tapped his fingers on his desk. “Call the project manager of Plan A, Liu Neng, over.” ”

“Okay.”Ally nodded.

“Not long after, ally came to the 33rd floor. “Manager Liu, the person upstairs wants you to go up.” ”

“Manager Liu was busy flirting with the female staff in the cubicle. He asked impatiently, “Who’s upstairs?” ”

“Ally said, “Who else can it be? It’s the new President Ye! A new official is in charge of three fires. Take it easy.” ”

President Ye?

That little girl?

“Manager Liu immediately straightened his back. “Allie, did she say anything?” ” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“”She didn’t say that.”Allie continued, “She just said that she wants you to go up.” ”

“Manager Liu nodded. “Okay, I got it.” ”

It was obvious that she didn’t take this matter to heart.

“Seeing him like this, Allie continued in a low voice, “This president ye might not be as simple as you think. Hurry up and go up. Don’t waste time. Be careful not to become the second Sun Yiran.” ”

Liu Neng licked his back teeth.

He knew what happened yesterday.

Ye Zao fired Sun Yiran on the first day he came to the consortium.

But so what?

Just wait.

“After today, Ye Zao would have to get out of the Shunxi Consortium. ”

“That little girl, Ye Zao, still wants to fight with the Zhao Family? ”

Dream On!

“Got it.”Liu Neng walked out of the cubicle and walked towards the elevator.

He walked all the way to the 57th floor.

Liu Neng reached out and knocked on the door.

“Come in.”A clear female voice came from inside.

“Liu Neng pushed the door open and entered. “President Ye, I’m Liu Neng.” ”

Ye Zao looked up slightly. “Are you in charge of this project a?”

“Yes.”Liu Neng nodded.

“Ye Zao flipped through two pages of the document in his hand. Finally, he placed the document on the table. His jade-like fingers tapped on the document. “Here, here, and here. Who are you planning to get to pay for the three funding loopholes?” ”

Liu Neng’s face turned pale.

He almost thought he was hearing things.

How did ye Zao See Through the loopholes?
