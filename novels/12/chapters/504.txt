“Lin Jincheng proposed to break off the engagement on such an important day as the engagement banquet, causing the woman to lose all her face. ”

“I believe that anyone would make a scene, right? ”

“After all, the Feng family was not a small family. ”

“Would Feng Qianhua Be So Nice? Not only was she not angry, she even came to give Old Lady Lin some health-preserving soup? ”

Was she the Virgin Mary?

Did she not have a temper?

“Old Lady Cen did not believe that there was such a person in the world. She frowned and said, “Could she have poisoned the soup? Old Lady, your eyes are blurry from old age. Don’t be poisoned to death!” ” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“”What nonsense are you spouting!”Old Lady Lin was almost angered to death by Old Lady Cen. “Qianhua is not that kind of person! Bai Tang, when you were young, you did not have a good mouth. Why are you still like this when you are old!” ”

Bai Tang was Old Lady Cen’s maiden name.

“When she was young, everyone called her candy. Because she was beautiful, the line of boys chasing after her was a few streets long. ”

“Old Lady Cen Glanced at Old Lady Lin, “Let me tell you, you can’t just look at things from the surface. Some people may look like a pure and flawless little white flower on the surface, but they are actually full of Evil! “Don’t be unhappy to hear what I have to say. She must be holding back some big trick by doing this! “You Old Lady, your eyesight is dim. Don’t be deceived by others and end up losing your virginity ”

“”You are not like me. My eyesight is very good! In current terms, you are just a silly and sweet person! You believe what others say, but in fact, you are nothing!” ”

Old Mrs. Cen and Old Mrs. Lin had known each other for a lifetime.

She knew old Mrs. Lin too well.

“She was soft-headed, domineering, and a bit snobbish. ”

“If they hadn’t been classmates and roommates when they were young and had some friendship, and later married in the capital at the same time, Old Mrs. Cen wouldn’t have bothered with an old silly sweet! ”

“Seeing that old Mrs. Cen was getting more and more outrageous, Old Mrs. Lin hurriedly stopped her, “You really misunderstood Qianhua! If she had poisoned the soup, I would have been poisoned to death long ago! Why would she wait until now?” ”

“If the other party wasn’t old Mrs. Cen, Old Mrs. Lin would have asked someone to kick her out long ago. ”

She couldn’t allow others to say anything bad about Feng Qianhua.

Poison?

It was fortunate that old Mrs. Cen was able to say it!

“Old Mrs. Cen saw that old Mrs. Lin was still one-track-minded, she said, “Fangyue, your Jin city isn’t a fool. He must have his own reasons for breaking off the engagement! Why do you say that? If you twist the melon, it won’t Be Sweet. Your children and grandchildren will have their own blessings. Why do you have to interfere? You’re already old. Can’t you just enjoy your family at home? “It’s also because your Jin city has a good temper! “If I Were Your Jin city, I wouldn’t be able to stand you!” ”

“”Let me tell you, when you’re old, you should mind your own business less. If you meddle too much, you’ll make people dislike you!” ”

Old Lady Lin originally thought that Old Lady Cen was here to comfort her.

She didn’t expect that every word she said would be more unpleasant than the last.

“Old Lady Lin continued, “Do you know why he suddenly announced the cancellation of the Engagement Party?” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen said, “Of course. He must have seen through someone’s true colors!” ”

“Old Mrs. Lin took a deep breath and tried her best to calm herself down, “He went to look for Ah Ze’s mother! It was that promiscuous B * Tch! When that B * Tch was good with Jin city, she cuckolded Jin city and gave birth to a bastard child with Ah Ze’s fraternal twins! “Do you think that kind of B * tch is worth him being like this?” ”

“Old Lady Lin continued, “Qianhua is so good. After waiting for him for nineteen years, isn’t she better than a promiscuous B * Tch? “If he dares to bring that B * Tch and that bastard home, I’ll fight him to the death!” ”

“”What B * Tch? You’re also a great-grandmother. Can’t you be a role model for the younger generation? What’s the point of always saying such words?” Old Mrs. Cen’s tone softened a little and continued, “Under normal circumstances, the probability of fraternal twins having the same mother and father is very low. Are you sure you’ve checked it out? is that child really not from your Jin City?” ”

“Old Mrs. Lin’s eyes were red as she said, “Jin city doesn’t believe me either. The appraisal report has been made five times abroad! But Can I lie about this? If that child really is of our Lin family’s bloodline, would I be so heartless as to ignore it?” ”

“But she’s not even a descendant of our Lin Family!”

“Old Lady Cen patted Old Lady Lin’s hand, then, she said, “Fangyue, you have to believe in your Jin city. He’s not a muddle-headed person! There must be some other hidden reason behind this matter. Otherwise, Jin city wouldn’t have suddenly canceled the engagement party. You’ve already missed out on the incident back then. You caused Jin city to lose a leg. Isn’t the price high enough?” ”
