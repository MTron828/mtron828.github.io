“”Alright.”Master Cao continued, “Then I’ll go do it now.” ”

“Thank you for your hard work.”The only person that Manxing could trust now was master Cao.

Master Cao turned around and left.

Manxing turned on the recording device and began to record the video.

“Soon, Manxing appeared on the other end of the video with tears in his eyes, “Hello, I’m full star... ... I’m really sorry, I’m a little out of shape today, and I didn’t expect to greet you like this, but first I’d like to apologize. I’m sorry For one thing, I didn’t expect my parents’death to be a secret, and for another, I still can’t believe that the murderer is my own brother . . ...” ”

“Speaking up to this point, Manxing was already in tears. He vividly portrayed the image of a good daughter and good sister. ”

“”I’m Manwen’s biological sister. I watched Manwen grow up from a young age. Manwen was really cute when he was young. Although he was a little different from other people’s children, he never did anything out of the ordinary. I really didn’t expect that Manwen would do such a thing... ... I’m sorry, I’m really sorry. I didn’t do my duty as a sister, nor did I do my duty as a daughter. I’ve let down my parents, and I’ve let down Manwen ... ...” ”

“Manxing was full of sincerity, causing the eyes of the people watching the video to turn red. ”

“[ Miss Manwen, this isn’t your fault! ] ”

“[ yes, this isn’t your fault at all! ]! [ Miss Man, you must not blame yourself. The reason why Manwen became like this has nothing to do with you. This is his nature. You and he are from the same mother. Why are you so outstanding and he so crazy? ]? [ even his biological parents can do it. ] ”

“[ sister is a good sister. Unfortunately, Brother is not a good brother. Sister has already done her best to be like Miss Manxing. ] ”

“”Lady of Manxing, although you are the elder sister of Manwen, you are not much older than Manwen.” ”

“”Although they are siblings, in fact, Lady of Manxing is only two years older than Manwen. The two of them are already about the same age. It is all his fault that Manwen has become like this. It has nothing to do with Lady of Manxing.” ”

“...”

“On this side, when ye Han saw the news on the starnet, his entire being was in a bad mood. He immediately rushed over to look for ye Zhuo. ”

“Sis! Something happened!”

“Ye Zao was chatting with Shi Qingcheng. When he saw ye Han like this, he looked back in puzzlement. “What happened?” ”

“”Man Wen, something happened to man Wen!”Ye Han said. ”

“Hearing this, ye Zao frowned slightly. ”

“What happened?”Ye Zao asked. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Ye Han immediately opened the portable system. “Look at this.”

“Looking at the situation on the starnet, ye Zao’s expression did not change. She had long expected that man Xing would not let it go, but she did not expect that man Xing would move so quickly. ”

It had only been a few days.

Man Xing could not sit still?

But this was also good.

It saved her from taking the initiative to make a move.

“”Sister, what do we do now?”Ye Han said anxiously, “Man Wen has already been caught and thrown in!” ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “You go to grandmother Fei’s house.” ”

“Go to Grandmother Fei’s house?”Ye Han was stunned for a moment and did not react.

“What time was it now, and Ye Zhuo still wanted him to go to Grandmother Fei’s house? ”

“Ye Han even thought that he had misheard and continued, “Sister, you want me to go to Grandma Fei’s house?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Why are you going to Grandma Fei’s house?”Ye Han continued to ask.

“Ye Zao said, “After you go, Grandma Fei will tell you.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Han nodded. “Then I’ll go right away.”

“Go quickly.”

Ye Han turned around and walked out.

“Shi Qingcheng looked at ye Zao and continued, “Zao Zao, do you need help?” ”

“”No need,”ye Zao replied. ”

“Shi Qingcheng continued, “Man Wen should have been wronged, right?”Although she had only met man Wen once, she could tell that man Wen was definitely not the kind of person who was cold-blooded and heartless. ”

“En.”Ye Zao nodded slightly. “He was framed by someone.”

“Shi Qingcheng saw that ye Zao was dressed calmly and continued, “Zao Zao, did you already expect this?” ”

“Ye Zao did not hide it. “Yes. Ever since man Jiangshan and Zhao Dan’s couple got into trouble, I felt that something was not right, so I kept an eye out.” ”

“At that time, Ye Zao was only guessing. She did not expect that the person who attacked man Jiangshan and Zhao Dan’s couple was actually man Xing. ”

“Man Xing was the daughter that this couple loved the most. The two of them would never have dreamed that one day, they would die at man Xing’s hands. ”

“Shi Qingcheng Hugged ye Zao’s arm. “Zao, you’re still as powerful as when you were young.” ”
