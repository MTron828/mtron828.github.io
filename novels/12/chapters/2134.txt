“She could tolerate Duanmu Liangchen having other people outside, but she couldn’t tolerate it. Those small fries ran up to her and showed off. ”

“Got it.”Duanmu Liangchen nodded. “Let’s go back first.”

The family of three sat on the aircraft.

“On the way, Duanmu Feng and Duanmu Liangchen ignored him. ”

On the other side.

Ye Zhuo was having breakfast downstairs when ye Shu jogged out of the elevator with a shiny object. “Zha Zha!”

“”What’s wrong, Mom?”Ye Zhuo raised his head and asked. ” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Ye Shu continued, “What’s that thing that keeps ringing? Did Something Happen?” ”

“Ye Zhuo saw that it was a quantum communicator and hurriedly took it. “Mom, I’ll go back to my room first.” ”

“”Okay, you go ahead.” ”

Ye Zao went to his room and opened the quantum communicator.

Cen Haifeng’s figure instantly appeared in the air.

“Miss Ye.”

“After guessing Shao Qing’s real identity, Cen Haifeng knew that Zhuo Ye was not Zhuo Ye. She was Cen Shaoqing’s girlfriend, Ye Zao. He then connected to ye Zao’s communicator. ”

“Although he had only met ye Zao once, Cen Haifeng could tell that Ye Zao was not an ordinary girl. ”

“Uncle?”Ye Zao was stunned.

Cen Haifeng suddenly finding her was completely out of ye Zao’s expectations.

“CEN Haifeng continued, “Miss Ye, I’m sorry to disturb you. First of all, I want to thank you for removing the forbidden spell for me. Otherwise, I would have been deceived by them for the rest of my life. Thank you!” ”

“Speaking up to this point, Cen Haifeng bowed to Ye Zao. ”

“You’re too polite.”

“CEN Haifeng continued, “Miss Ye, there’s one more thing I want to trouble you with.” ”

“Ye Zao said, “Please speak.” ”

“CEN Haifeng said, “I want to bring my mother, Xiangxiang, and the children to the General Alliance, but I don’t know if they’re willing to come. So, Miss Ye, can you help me ask them?” ”

“Cen Haifeng really didn’t have the face to see his family anymore. After thinking about it, he could only ask ye Zao for help. ”

“Ye Zao hesitated for a moment and then said, “Sure.” ”

“”Then I’ll leave it to you, Miss Ye,”Cen Haifeng continued. ”

“”It’s nothing,”ye Zao said. ”

“After cutting off the connection, ye Zao had no intention to eat breakfast again. Thinking that Cen Shaoqing hadn’t been in the base for the past few days, he made a trip to the CEN group. ”

“After hearing ye Zao’s words, Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads but did not say anything. After a moment, he turned around and looked at ye Zao. “Let’s go back and ask Grandma?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

Old Mrs. Cen was dancing in the garden. She had to pick up her skills and wait to see that unfilial son before she could perform better.

It was not her style to sit at home and mourn!

She had to continue living.

“Grandma Cen.”

“”Yezi!”Seeing ye Zhuo, old Mrs. Cen suddenly did not have any worries. Her face was full of smiles. ”

“”Grandma Cen, your sword dance is really good!”Ye Zhuo said with a smile. ”

“”That’s a must!”Old Mrs. Cen said with a smile, “Back then, I even won the championship! Many people lost to me!” ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Right, Grandma Cen, I have something to tell you.” ”

“”Go Ahead,”said old Mrs. Cen. ”

Ye Zhuo passed Cen Haifeng’s words to Old Mrs. Cen.

“Hearing this, Old Mrs. Cen nodded. “Go! Why Not! I want to see what the Little Vixen of the Allied countries looks like, to be able to bewitch him into forgetting his family!” ”

“At the same time, she also wanted to seek justice for Zhou Xiang! ”

“Ye Zhuo did not expect old madam Cen to agree to this matter so quickly. She continued, “Do you want to ask Aunt Xiang?” ”

“”Zhuozhuo, there’s no need to ask. Your grandmother’s meaning is my meaning.”Zhou Xiang walked out from the side. ”

“Aunt Xiang.”Ye Zhuo called out politely.

“Zhou Xiang nodded and looked at Ye Zhuo. “Zhuozhuo, I’m willing to meet him.” ”

It was not her style to avoid meeting him.

She wanted to personally ask him what had happened in the past 20 years.

“Compared to a day ago, Zhou Xiang’s emotions were much more stable, and her face was a little better. ”

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Then I’ll tell Uncle.”

“”Sorry to trouble you,”Zhou Xiang said. ”

“”Auntie, you’re being too polite.” ”

...

As soon as this news came out.

“Some people in the Allied countries were happy, while others were worried. ”

“Duanmu Fengyu was also very happy to learn that the young master of Dongli was finally going to return to her country. However, when she thought about the messy people on Earth who would also come along, she felt very uncomfortable, especially that girlfriend of Cen Shaoqing’s. ”

“Mrs. Duanmu comforted her, “Fengyu, no matter how outstanding that woman from Earth is, she can’t be compared to you. You Don’t have to lower your status and compare yourself to that kind of person.” ”
