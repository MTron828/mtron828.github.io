Chapter 2688: 596: What’s Going On? 1

Translator: 549690339

Zhou Ziyue was against ye Sui coming to the capital to look for ye Shu from the very beginning.

“Because she clearly knew that as long as a person was rich, they would turn bad. ”

Ye Shu was now a wealthy lady who stood high above the masses. She was no longer the ye Shu of the past.

Only ye Sui was deceiving himself and could not see the reality clearly.

“Zhou ziyue continued, “Ye Shu is right. Let’s stop when things are good! Pack up and go back quickly!” ”

“Under such circumstances, if they continued to stay here, they would only embarrass themselves. ”

Go Back?

“Ye Sui stared at Zhou Ziyue with wide eyes and said angrily, “This is my sister’s home. Why should I go back?” ”

“”Your sister?”Zhou Ziyue looked at ye Sui, “You say it nicely, but does she treat you as her sister?” ”

Ye Sui was simply daydreaming!

“As long as ye Shu treated ye Sui as her sister, ye Sui would not be in such a passive position. ”

“Ye Sui continued, “Even if she doesn’t treat me as her sister, I’m still her biological sister!” ”

“Zhou Ziyue had yet to find a rich second-generation boyfriend, Zhou Libang had yet to become the boss of the Lin Corporation, and she had yet to buy a villa. She would not leave the Lin family. ”

Zhou Ziyue looked at ye Sui speechlessly. “Then you can just stay here and beg for your life! I’ll go back tomorrow!”

She could not stay any longer.

“”If you dare to go back, I won’t have a daughter like you in the future!”Ye Sui said. ”

Zhou Ziyue took a deep breath. “Can you be reasonable!”

“Ye Sui was too lazy to discuss irrelevant topics. He continued, “Have you explained things clearly to Feng Yang?” ”

“You’re still hoping that Ye Shu can introduce me to a boyfriend?”Zhou Ziyue asked.

“Ye Sui said, “You’re her biological niece. Why Can’t she introduce you to a boyfriend? I’ve heard that even her idiot daughter has found a big shot with a big background. Why Can’t You?” ”

“Other than not being as good-looking as that little idiot, what else could Zhou Ziyue not be better than that little idiot? ”

“Ye Sui warned, “Hurry up and break up with Feng Yang!” ”

“Zhou Ziyue wanted to say something, but in the end, she did not say anything. ”

“What about the Villa?”Zhou Ziyue asked.

“Ye Shu has to buy this villa even if he doesn’t want to!”Ye Sui narrowed his eyes.

Zhou Ziyue shook her head speechlessly.

“It was already so late, and she was still dreaming. ”

“Ye Sui continued, “Mind your own business and mind your own business!” ”

She definitely had a way.

Du Du du —

“At this moment, there was a knock on the door. ”

Zhou Ziyue got up to open the door.

“Ziyue.”Bai Jingshu stood outside the door.

“Zhou ziyue smiled and said, “Why is Jingshu Here? Come in and have a seat.” ”

Bai Jingshu nodded and followed her in.

“Seeing Bai Jingshu, ye Sui, who had been pulling a long face, instantly smiled. “Jingshu is here.” ”

“Second aunt.”

“Ye Sui stood up and said, “Sit, sit, sit.” ”

“Bai Jingshu sat on the sofa and said with a smile, “Did you have fun today, second aunt?” ”

“”Yes, I did.”Ye Sui nodded repeatedly and said with a smile, “The capital is the capital. It’s much more fun than the small place of Yun Capital!” ”

“Bai Jingshu continued, “Then second aunt must stay at home for a few more days.” ”

“Okay.”

“After chatting for a while, Bai Jingshu continued, “By the way, I heard that Ziyue doesn’t have a boyfriend right now, right?” ”

“Hearing this, ye Sui narrowed his eyes. ”

Did Bai Jingshu mean to introduce a boyfriend to Zhou Ziyue?

Bai Jingshu was the daughter-in-law of the Lin family. The people she knew were definitely from influential families.

“Thinking of this, ye Sui was extremely excited. ”

“Without waiting for Zhou Ziyue to speak, ye Sui immediately replied, “No, no, I was just worried! What should I do if this child can’t find a boyfriend? After all, she’s already at an old age.” ”

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “Why don’t I introduce someone to Jingshu?” ”

“Ye Sui said, “Of course it’ll be great!” ”

“After saying that, ye Sui said, “Jingshu, I’ll leave this matter to you.” ”

“”Of course.”Bai Jingshu looked at Zhou Ziyue and said, “Ziyue, why don’t you guys add each other on wechat and get to know each other better?” ”

“Ye Sui said, “Don’t add me on wechat. You Can’t see me on wechat right now. Jingshu, why don’t you ask the boy out and meet him. If possible, you can add me on wechat.” ”

“Bai Jingshu nodded. “That works too. Ziyue, when are you free?” ”

Zhou Ziyue hesitated but didn’t say anything.

Was she really going to break up with Feng Yang?

“Although she was mentally prepared, Zhou Ziyue had an indescribable feeling in her heart when it really came to this. ”

She felt a little sad.

“Ye Sui smiled and said, “Ziyue has never been in a relationship before! Look at her, she’s embarrassed!” ”

“Bai Jingshu said, “There are very few girls like Ziyue these days.” ”

“”I do hope that she can be like other girls,”ye Sui continued, “That way, I won’t have to worry about her every day!” ”

“Bai Jingshu continued, “Then when Will Ziyue Be Free? I’ll contact her.” ”

“”Our Ziyue is free whenever she wants. Jingshu, just make the arrangements,”ye Sui said. ”

Bai Jingshu nodded. “Alright.”

“After ending the topic, Bai Jingshu stood up. “Second aunt, I’ll go back first.” ”

“”Okay, okay, okay. It’s getting late. You should go back and rest early.”Ye Sui stood up and walked Bai Jingshu out. ”

“After closing the door, ye Sui walked to Zhou Ziyue. “Did you hear what Bai Jingshu said just now?” ”

Zhou Ziyue didn’t say anything.

“Ye Sui continued, “Anyway, the opportunity is right in front of you. It’s up to you to seize it!” ”

On the other side.

Bai Jingshu returned to her room.

“Lin Ze was sitting in front of his computer. When he saw her return from outside, he asked, “Where did you go?” ”

“Bai Jingshu said, “I came back from Ziyue’s place.” ”

“Hearing this, Lin Ze frowned slightly. “Didn’t I tell you to stay away from her?” ”

“”You’re just thinking too much,”Bai Jingshu said. “I think Ziyue is pretty good. I was even planning to introduce a boyfriend to her.” ”

“Introduce a boyfriend?”Lin Ze asked.

“Yes.”

“Lin Ze asked again, “Who is it?” ”

“Bai Jingshu continued, “It’s an author. He’s 26 years old this year.” ”

“How’s his family background?”Lin Ze asked.

“Bai Jingshu said, “His family background isn’t bad, right? The main thing is that he’s an outstanding person. His parents are both very simple and rural people. Now, he has a villa in Beijing.” ”

“Lin Ze continued, “Then Zhou Ziyue might not like him.” ”

“How do you know?”Bai Jingshu asked.

“Lin Ze said, “It’s very obvious that Zhou Ziyue wants to find a rich second generation. Moreover, I suspect that Zhou Ziyue already has a boyfriend.” ”

“She said that she doesn’t have a boyfriend. Don’t talk nonsense. Second Aunt said that Ziyue has never been in a relationship.”Bai Jingshu still believed in Zhou Ziyue.

“”Never been in a relationship?”Lin Ze shook his head helplessly. “Sure enough, she’s been pregnant for three years. How can you believe such nonsense?” ”

“”Don’t think that people are so evil,”Bai Jingshu said. ”

“Lin Ze continued, “It’s not that I’m evil, but that’s the truth.” ”

“How do you know?”Bai Jingshu asked.

“I can tell.”

“What do you think?”Bai Jingshu asked.

“Lin Ze continued, “A young lady and a young lady walk differently.” ”

“Ah?”Bai Jingshu looked puzzled. “There’s such a saying?”

“Yes.”Lin Ze nodded.

“Bai Jingshu continued, “But the naked eye isn’t a machine scan. There will always be mistakes. You must have made a mistake!” ”

“Lin Ze did not say much and just said, “Facts speak louder than words. Just wait and see. Zhou Ziyue will definitely not like the one you introduced to her.” ”

“”That may not be the case,”Bai Jingshu said. ”

“Then just wait and see.”

“Bai Jingshu applied some skincare products for a while and then said, “I’ll go and contact Zheng Ke now.” ”

“After contacting Zheng Ke, Bai Jingshu went to Zhou Ziyue’s room again. ”

Zhou Ziyue didn’t speak the entire time.

“Ye Sui smiled and said, “Okay, okay, okay. Don’t worry. Ziyue will definitely arrive on time tomorrow.” ” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded.

“Ye Sui walked in front of Zhou Ziyue and continued, “Did you hear that? Remember to dress better tomorrow.” ”

“Got it.”Zhou Ziyue nodded.

“She didn’t want to betray Feng Yang, nor did she want to break up with Feng Yang. ”

She just wanted to see what kind of person Bai Jingshu had introduced to her.

The next day.

Bai Jingshu came to look for Zhou Ziyue punctually.

Zhou Ziyue had already washed up and dressed up.

“Ye Sui smiled and said, “Jingshu, I’ll leave our Ziyue to You Then.” ”

“Okay.”

The two of them went out together.

“Bai Jingshu said, “Ziyue, don’t be nervous. It’s Zheng Ke’s first blind date. He’s definitely more nervous than you.” ”

“Zhou Ziyue nodded. “Yes, I know.” ”

“Bai Jingshu continued, “Zheng Ke has been very outstanding since he was young. Although his family background is average, he’s very hardworking and hardworking. He has already settled down in the capital city.” ”

Average family background?

What was going on?

Zhou Ziyue’s eyes were filled with confusion.

Could it be that Bai Jingshu didn’t introduce her to a rich second generation?
