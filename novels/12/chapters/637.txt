“Hearing this, Lin Qingxuan frowned. ”

“From these words, it wasn’t hard to tell that not only was Jiang Suran too vain, she also worshipped foreign countries. ”

“Although Lin Qingxuan was away all year round, he didn’t feel that China was inferior to country M. ”

“Moreover, he had chosen to go abroad back then because he wanted to bring Zhao shuning to avoid those rumors. ”

He really could not admire a person like Jiang Suran.

“Lin Qingxuan had initially wanted to deal with Old Lady Lin, but now he did not even want to deal with her anymore. He turned to look at Old Lady Lin. “I still have something to do. I’ll be leaving First!” ”

No one had expected Lin Qingxuan to suddenly change his attitude.

This included Jiang Suran. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Old Lady Lin stood up. “Qingxuan! Where are you going?”

“I have something to do.”

“”Qingxuan, stop right there!” ”

Lin Qingxuan turned a deaf ear to her.

Old Madam Lin was so angry that her face turned pale and her breathing became unsteady.

“In front of outsiders, couldn’t Lin Qingxuan, the most filial and obedient son, leave her some face? ”

“She was already so old, why did she still have to look at her son’s face? ”

“Feng Qianhua walked to Old Madam Lin’s side and smiled. “Aunt Lin, maybe fourth brother has something urgent to do? You, don’t be angry!” ”

“Jiang Suran followed, “Qianhua is right. This Mr. Lin must have something urgent. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be in such a hurry to Flirt. You Don’t have to take it to heart.” ”

Jiang Suran was quite uncertain at this moment.

“As the person in charge, she knew very well why Lin Qingxuan wanted to leave. ”

The Lin family was big and powerful. Jiang Suran didn’t want to give up just like that.

Even if there was only a glimmer of hope.

“Since Lin Qingxuan was the most obedient of all old lady Lin’s sons, then she had to please Old Lady Lin. As long as Old Lady Lin took a liking to her, even if Lin Qingxuan had a problem with it, she could only keep it. ”

“Hearing this, Old Lady Lin felt a little better. She walked down the stairs. “This child! Even if there’s an emergency, you can’t just leave an important guest behind!” ”

Honored Guest?

The corners of Jiang Suran’s lips curled up.

“It seemed that she had already occupied an important position in Madam Lin’s heart. Otherwise, Madam Lin would not have used the word ‘honored guest’. ”

She could finally put down the heart that was hanging high up in the air.

“Jiang suran smiled and said, “Madam Lin, you’re too kind! How can I be considered as an honored guest!” ”

“”I can be considered as an honored guest!”Madam Lin held Jiang Suran’s hand. “Suran, you’re an honored guest of Our Lin Family!” ”

“Feng Qianhua said in a timely manner, “Aunt Lin, su ran, sooner or later, we’re going to become a family. Aren’t we being too polite?” ”

“Old Madam Lin nodded. “Yes! Qianhua is right! Sooner or later, we’re going to become a family. It’s too polite to be polite.” ”

Jiang su ran and Feng Qianhua exchanged a look.

“Just then, Lin Jin Cheng walked in from outside. ”

“Seeing Lin Jincheng come in, Feng Qianhua’s eyes lit up and she immediately stood up. “Brother Jincheng.” ”

Jiang Su ran greeted him as well. “Mr. Fifth Lin.”

Lin Jincheng nodded at the two of them.

“Old Madam Lin looked at Lin Jincheng. “Jincheng, why are you here?”These days, Lin Jincheng had been staying in the east wing and rarely came to her west wing. ”

“Could it be that he hadn’t seen Feng Qianhua for a long time, so he came to see Feng Qianhua? ”

Old Lady Lin knew that Lin Jincheng and ye Shu were still sleeping in separate beds.

That B * Tch ye Shu would be driven out of the Lin family by Lin Jincheng one day!

“Lin Jincheng continued, “Mom, Master Yu will come to the capital tomorrow.” ”

Master Yu?

Feng Qianhua’s eyes lit up when she heard this.

Master Yu was a great figure in the literary world.

“He had a good relationship with master Lin a few years ago. Although master Lin had passed away a long time ago, he would definitely visit the Lin family once he came to the capital. ”

Master Yu was a very low-key person. He had only taken in one disciple in his life.

“Feng Qianhua intended to let Feng Xianxian enter the literature association, but she had no choice. She had not found an opportunity because master Yu had not come to the capital for eight years. ”

“Eight years ago, Feng Xianxian was only an 11-year-old child. She did not have much attainments in literature. Now that she had been through countless trials and tribulations, Feng Xianxian already had her own views on literature. At this time.., it was most suitable for Old Lady Lin to personally introduce Feng Xianxian to master Yu. ”

“Master Yu was already 80 years old this year. If Feng Xianxian could become master Yu’s last disciple, her future would be limitless. Even the Feng family’s status in the capital would rise along with it. ”

Wasn’t there a saying?

The smell of ink was like the stench of copper.

“No matter what time it was, the pursuit of literature by mankind was never-ending. ”
