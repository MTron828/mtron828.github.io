Translator: 549690339

“From the moment she left the Cen family, everyone looked down on her and Zhou Rui. ”

They thought that Zhou Rui was a womanizer.

“But now, she had already left the CEN family for more than half a month. Not only did Zhou Rui not have any change of heart, he even took good care of her. Their relationship was more than twice as good as ten days ago. ”

“After saying this, Cen Yuyan turned around and left. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen looked at Cen Yuyan’s back. “Karma isn’t good! This little bastard, sooner or later, she will cry!” ”

“Zhou Xiang did not know why Cen Yuyan had suddenly become like this. He sighed and turned to look at Old Mrs. Cen. “Mom, don’t be angry. This fourth girl is getting more and more outrageous. It’s not worth it to be angry with her.” ”

“”No, I’m not angry! I’m more than Happy Now!”Old Mrs. Cen knocked her walking stick on the ground, “I’m waiting for this little B * Stard to suffer retribution! At that time, none of you are allowed to sympathize with her! This kind of person is not worthy of sympathy at all! This little B * Stard is nothing!” ”

“Zhou Xiang supported Old Mrs. Cen. “Then, are we going home now?” ” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“”Why are we going home? We’re here to shop, not to be bullied! Now that we’re only halfway through shopping, of course we have to continue shopping! We can’t let a Little B * stard ruin our mood! Not only do we have to continue shopping, we also have to shop happily! That Little B * Stard will die of anger!” ”

Zhou Xiang broke into a smile.

“She had been old Mrs. Cen’s mother-in-law and daughter-in-law for decades, and no one knew old Mrs. Cen better than she did. ”

Old Granny Cen was an optimist. She would not get angry unless it was something that made people angry.

“Indeed, Cen Yuyan had gone too far. ”

Zhou Xiang had never felt so troubled before.

“If she allowed Cen Yuyan to continue like this, she would definitely cause a big mess. ”

Zhou Xiang narrowed his eyes.

“On this side, Song Chenyu saw Cen Yuyan return with her face covered. He asked with concern, “Yuyan, what happened to you?” ”

Cen Yuyan bit her lip. “It’s nothing. I was bitten by a Mad Dog.”

“In her opinion, old Mrs. Cen was no different from a mad dog that bit people. ”

“Clearly, everything was old Mrs. Cen’s problem, but Old Mrs. Cen pushed all the responsibility onto her head. ”

Other People’s grandmothers retired to the front line to take care of themselves when they were old.

Old Mrs. Cen wouldn’t stop until she was old and had to stir up some trouble.

She had to make the Cen family suffer until they were destroyed before she could be happy!

“The more Cen Yuyan thought about it, the angrier she got. ”

“Seeing Cen Yuyan like this, Song Chenyu had an idea and continued, “You were beaten by your grandmother?” ”

“En.”Cen Yuyan nodded.

Song Chenyu sighed. “They still oppose you being together with Zhou Rui?”

“Cen Yuyan didn’t want song Chenyu to know that she was beaten because she was together with song Chenyu. She nodded and said, “En.” ”

“Looks like your grandmother and the others still have a deep misunderstanding of Zhou Rui.”

“Cen Yuyan said angrily, “They are snobbish. Because Zhou Rui’s family environment is not as good as ours, they think that Zhou Rui has taken a liking to my money! In fact, Zhou Rui is not such a person!” ”

“If Zhou Rui really took a liking to her money, he would have broken up with her long ago. ”

Why wait until now?

“After all, she had already severed her relationship with the CEN family half a month ago. ”

“Song Chenyu said, “As the saying goes, ‘distance knows horse power, but time reveals the heart’. I believe that Grandma and the others will one day let go of their prejudice against Zhou Rui.” ”

“”I don’t expect them to wake up now,”Cen Yuyan continued, “It’s fine just like this. Zhou Rui can take care of me anyway.” ”

Zhou Rui took care of her?

A hint of mockery flashed in song Chenyu’s eyes.

Zhou Rui’s money came from her!

“If Cen Yuyan’s relationship with the Cen family remained at a stalemate, song Chenyu would be the first one who couldn’t stand it. ”

“”You’re still the best. Even if you break up with your family, you still have a boyfriend. You’re not like me, who’s all alone.”Song Chenyu’s eyes turned into envy. ”

“”Who said you’re all alone? In My Heart, you’re Shaoqing’s girlfriend! It’s all ye Zao’s fault. If it weren’t for ye Zao, you would have been family with me by Now!” ”

“Hearing this, song Chenyu’s face was full of embarrassment. “Don’t say that. How can I be worthy of Fifth Master Cen?” ”

“”If you say that I’m not worthy, Ye Zao is the one who’s really not worthy.”Cen Yuyan’s eyes were full of ridicule, “If you say that she’s really stupid, she can’t even see through reality and acting! My fifth brother is coaxing her to play! She can’t even see through it!” ”

“Song Chenyu said softly, “I feel that fifth master Cen doesn’t seem to be acting. Perhaps they’re in love.” ”
