“Yu Zifei did not understand old nie. He really did not understand. As a person, one should have a beginning and an end. What was the point of retreating halfway? ”

“Teacher! This is not the work of a Gentleman!”

“Old NIE continued, “I only know that a wise man submits to circumstances! Since you mentioned the work of a gentleman, after I leave, you can volunteer and apply to join Miss Ye’s research group!” ”

“After saying this, old nie strode towards the construction warehouse. ”

Yu Zifei looked at old nie’s back and frowned.

“Cen Jiang had been waiting for old nie for a long time. “Old Nie, you’re finally here!” ”

“Old Nie ignored Cen Jiang and looked at Ye Zhuo. “Miss Ye, I have a presumptuous request. I hope you can fulfill it.” ”

Ye Zhuo raised his eyes slightly. “Go ahead.”

“Old Nie continued, “Miss Ye, I’m almost 50 years old this year. There are many things that I’m already unable to do. Back then, I didn’t think it through and joined your research group. Now that I think about it, I really shouldn’t have, so I think... ... I think.. ... ...” ”

“Quitting at the last minute was indeed not something to shed tears in the light. At the end, old Nie felt a little embarrassed. ”

“Ye Zhuo revealed old nie’s worries in a single sentence. “So you’re backing out of the research team first, right?” ”

“Yes.”Old Nie hurriedly nodded.

“Cen Jiang said in disbelief, “Old nie! What are you talking about? You’re joking with Miss Ye, right?” ”

“Old Nie shook his head and said very seriously, “Team leader Cen, I’m not joking.” ”

“”Old Nie!”Cen Jiang frowned. “Now that the aircraft carrier plan has been implemented, what do you mean by backing out now?” ”

“Old Nie raised his head to look at Cen Jiang. “Team leader Cen, I have my own difficulties. I hope you can understand.” ”

Understand?

Withdrawing at the last minute was a matter of character. How could he understand old nie?

“Not to mention that he couldn’t understand old nie, he probably wouldn’t be able to pass ye Zhuo’s test! ”

“Cen Jiang continued, “Old nie, you were the one who volunteered to join our research team back then. No one made things difficult for you. Now that you want to withdraw, don’t you think it’s a very immoral thing to do?” ”

“”Back then, it was my fault for being obsessed. I’m willing to bear all the consequences.” ”

“Cen Jiang was so angry that he pressed his temples. He looked at ye Zao again, and his expression remained indifferent. ”

“”Miss Ye, I hope you can help me!”Old Nie looked at ye Zao with a sincere attitude. ”

“Ye Zao’s red lips opened slightly. “It’s not sweet to force things. Since you’ve already said it to this extent, then I won’t force you to stay. But there’s something I want to say first.” ”

“”Miss Ye, please speak,”said old nie. ”

“Ye Zhuo’s expression was indifferent as he enunciated each word clearly. “You only have one chance. If you choose to withdraw this time and want to join us again, it’ll be difficult. I, Ye Zhuo, never accept people who go back on their words and have other intentions!” ”

“Hearing this, old nie almost laughed out loud. ”

Regret?

He would regret it?

“This little girl, Ye Zhuo, isn’t she overestimating me too much! ”

Who Did she think she was?

“Old Nie held back the smile in his heart and looked up at Ye Zhuo. “Miss Ye, don’t worry! I, old NIE, have always kept my word and never regretted it! Since I said so today, I definitely won’t regret it!” ”

“Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and turned to look at the others. “If any of you are like old Nie and don’t want to stay here, you can choose to leave with old nie.” ”

“As soon as he said this, five or six people immediately walked out and stood behind old nie. ”

“Ye Zao continued, “Is there anyone else?” ”

Another seven or eight people walked out one after another.

“They were already full of questions about the aircraft carrier plan. Now that they saw that ye Zao was so young, they became even more nervous. Now that they heard ye Zao say this, they all chose to stand out. ”

“Is there anyone else?”Ye Zao asked again.

“Seeing that no one stood out, ye Zao continued, “Are you sure there’s no one else? If we miss this opportunity today, if anyone regrets leaving at the last minute in the future, it won’t be that simple!” ”

“After saying this, more than ten people stood out. ”

“This way, the technical team’s personnel were reduced by more than half. ”

Cen Jiang was extremely anxious. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Since everyone had left, how was the aircraft carrier plan going to continue? ”

Ye Zhuo’s expression did not change. “Is there anyone else?”

“This time, no one stood up. ”

“Ye Zhuo turned to look at Tang Mi. “Little Tang, bring them to go through the procedures.” ”

“”Okay.”Tang mi nodded and turned to look at everyone. “Everyone, follow me.” ”

“After everyone left, Ye Zhuo turned to Cen Jiang and said, “Find someone to replace old Nie’s work. Then, tell me about the problems you’ve encountered.” ”

“”Okay.”Under the current situation, Cen Jiang could only try his best to calm himself down. ”

“After giving Cen Jiang Instructions, ye Zhuo tied up his hair and casually picked up a thin wire to fix it. Then, he put a helmet on his head and walked into the construction warehouse. ”

Cen Jiang stared blankly at Ye Zao’s back. It took him a long time to react and quickly ran over to look for ye Zao.

“About an hour later, Cen Jiang did the handover work and brought his men to the construction warehouse. However, Ye Zao was nowhere to be seen. ”

“Coincidentally, Tang Mi was walking over. Cen Jiang pulled tang mi and said, “Little Stutterer, have you seen Miss Ye?” ”

“Tang mi said, “Miss Ye is in area c.” ”

“”Thank you.”Cen Jiang turned to look at the man beside him. “Zhou Gong, let’s go to Area C!” ”

The man known as Zhou Gong nodded.

“As soon as they arrived at Area C, they saw ye Zhuo wearing a helmet and standing in the middle of a group of workers, “In order to solve the problem of aircraft carriers flying at hypersonic speeds in the atmosphere, we have to use nuclear reactors to power them. Therefore, don’t skip the steps that shouldn’t be skipped here!” ”

“Someone questioned, “Nuclear reactors require a large number of reactors. Normal nuclear power plants, nuclear submarines, and all of them are built at the seaside. We are not near the seaside here. Will this really work?” ”

Ye Zao’s eyebrows remained unchanged. He picked up the blueprint and wrote a formula in less than a few minutes. He handed it to the person. “Take a look at this.”

“After the person received ye Zao’s formula, he was immediately speechless. ”

“At this moment, Cen Jiang brought Zhou Gong to ye Zao’s side and said, “Miss Ye! This is Zhou Gong, the person who replaced old nie.” ”

“Ye Zao took the initiative to extend his hand to Zhou Gong. “Hello, I’m Ye Zao.” ”

“”Miss Ye, I’ve heard a lot about you. I’m Zhou Dongyang!”Zhou Gong reached out and held ye Zao’s hand. ”

“After saying that, Zhou Gong took out the blueprint and continued, “Miss Ye! You see, there’s a problem here. No matter what kind of welding tool is used here, it can’t achieve the precise effect that you want.” ”

“Ye Zhuo took the blueprint and frowned slightly. “How about this, I’ll follow you to the scene to take a look.” ”

“Okay.”Zhou Gong nodded.

Ye Zhuo followed Zhou Gong to Area C.

On the other side.

Old Nie came to Tang Xue’s laboratory.

“Tang Xue welcomed old Nie’s arrival. “Nie Gong, welcome to our laboratory.” ”

“Old Nie said a little embarrassedly, “Miss Tang, I still have something to trouble you with.” ”

“Go ahead.”

“Old Nie continued, “Besides me, there are more than twenty other researchers who have left Miss Ye’s research group, so I’d like to ask for your help.” ”

More than twenty researchers had left!

Wasn’t this equivalent to more than half of ye Zao’s main research group members leaving?

“Thinking of this, Tang Xue’s eyes flickered with Schadenfreude. ”

More than twenty research members had left. She wanted to see how ye Zao would end up next.
