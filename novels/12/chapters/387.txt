Translator: 549690339

“After scolding, father Li hung up the phone. ”

“Li Qiandong called again, but the line was already busy. ”

This meant that he was blacklisted!

Li Qiandong was father Li’s old son. He was very indulgent towards Li Qiandong and never interfered in his affairs.

Why would father Li remove his position this time?

Li Qiandong frowned.

He suddenly thought of Cen Shaoqing.

Yes!

It was definitely Cen Shaoqing.

“Cen Shaoqing was the Li Group’s largest shareholder. If it wasn’t for Cen Shaoqing’s intention, father Li would never have done such a thing. ”

Cen Shaoqing’s heart was too ruthless!

“He clearly liked mu yourong, so why did he do this? ”

Shouldn’t he protect someone he liked?

“If he hurt Mu Yourong like this, would mu yourong still forgive him? ”

Li Qiandong felt extremely uncomfortable and went straight to the CEN group.

“”Fifth brother, did you ask my father to remove me from my position?” ”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing held the Buddhist bead in his hand and nodded indifferently. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Li Qiandong frowned. “Fifth brother, why did you do this? Do you know that the MU group is about to go bankrupt! Are you going to watch as Miss Mu’s family goes bankrupt?” ”

Cen Shaoqing continued to twirl the Buddhist beads. “What does the MU family’s bankruptcy have to do with me?”

“Li Qiandong frowned. “Fifth brother, I’m the general manager of the Li Corporation after all. How can you remove my position without even informing me? !” ”

“If this were to spread, wouldn’t he lose face? ”

“”What I decide, is it up to you to Judge?”Cen Shaoqing raised his eyelids and looked at Li Qiandong, his eyes filled with a myriad of pressure. ”

“Li Qiandong’s heart trembled and he immediately stopped. He prayed in a low voice, “Fifth brother, I beg you to reinstate my position! The Mu family can not go bankrupt! Otherwise, you will regret it for the rest of your life!” ”

He was doing this for Cen Shaoqing’s good.

“It was one thing that Cen Shaoqing did not appreciate his kindness, but now he had to show him his face! ”

“Now, he was no longer human! ”

“It was said that if God opened a door for you, he would close a window for you. ”

Cen Shaoqing was a typical example.

Mu Yourong was so good that he could not see.

It was as if he was blind.

“To be deceived to this extent by a woman! She said that you were as stupid as a pig and even insulted a pig!”Cen Shaoqing’s eyes were filled with anger. “You are 28 years old this year! Not 8 years old!”

Cen Shaoqing rarely lost his temper.

The air was so quiet that it was terrifying.

Li Qiandong did not dare to say another word.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Uncle Li only has one son, and he has placed a lot of hopes on you! Can you help him to live up to his expectations? If the day comes when he is completely disappointed, it will be too late for you to regret it.” ”

Li Qiandong lowered his head and did not say a word.

“Cen Shaoqing narrowed his eyes. “Go back now and reflect on yourself! When you have done so, I will consider reinstating your position.” ”

Li Qiandong turned around and left Cen Shaoqing’s office.

Cen Shaoqing pinched his nose helplessly as he watched Li Qiandong’s back.

At first.

He thought that Li Qiandong was just confused. He didn’t expect that Li Qiandong was really stupid.

“After leaving the CEN Group, Li Qiandong didn’t go back immediately. Instead, he went to the bank and prepared to transfer a sum of money from his private account to the MU group’s account. ”

“No matter what, he could not just watch the MU group collapse. ”

“Moreover, he had already promised mu yourong. ”

“He had already promised her, but he had not done it. ”

How would mu Yourong view him in the future?

“Li Qiandong sat at the VIP window. The cashier raised her head and looked at Li Qiandong. “Mr. Li, how much do you want to transfer?” ”

“”I’ll transfer one billion first,”Li Qiandong said. ”

One billion was enough for the MU Corporation to operate.

They had to get through the crisis first.

“Okay.”

“Two minutes later, the Teller looked up at Li Qiandong with a complicated expression. “Mr. Li, I’m sorry! Your account has been frozen. You Can’t transfer any money out at the moment.” ”

“What?”Li Qiandong looked at the teller in disbelief.

The Teller repeated what he had just said.

Li Qiandong frowned.

This result was beyond his expectations.

He had not expected that Cen Shaoqing would be so ruthless.

He had even frozen his private account.

Then what should he do now?

Li Qiandong walked out of the bank in a daze.

“When he thought of Mu Yourong’s pear-shaped face, Li Qiandong’s heart ached terribly. ”

How could he let Mu Yourong Down?

“Thus, Li Qiandong called his rich second-generation friends. ”

“But when they heard that Li Qiandong wanted to borrow money, they were so scared that they found excuses to hang up the phone. ”
