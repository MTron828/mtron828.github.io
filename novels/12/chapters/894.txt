“She was injured now, so she naturally couldn’t let song Chenyu see it.”

“”Okay.”Song Chenyu continued, “Then I wish you all the best.””

“After hanging up the phone, song Chenyu felt that Cen Yuyan was a little strange today, but he couldn’t figure out what was strange about her.”

Song Chenyu frowned.

“However, song Chenyu did not have time to think about what was strange about Cen Yuyan.”

“At first, she thought that ye Zao would definitely apologize to her.”

“Now That Ye Zao did not apologize to her, and she had told brother Tao, she had to call brother Tao to explain.”

“After brother Tao went back, he had been refreshing Weibo’s hot searches. However, after waiting for a long time, he did not manage to refresh the hot searches that ye Zao had apologized to Song Chenyu.”

“At this moment, brother Tao received a call from Song Chenyu.”

“Song Chenyu said tactfully, “Brother Tao, there might be some changes in ye Zhuo’s matter.””

“Brother Tao could hear the hidden meaning in song Chenyu’s words. He frowned and said, “She doesn’t want to apologize again?””

“Yes.”Song Chenyu squeezed out this word from his throat.

“Brother Tao pinched his temples and said with a slightly tired expression, “Alright, you should rest well first. Don’t let your imagination run wild during this period of time.””

“”I know, brother Tao.”Song Chenyu continued, “Sorry for the trouble.””

“It’s alright.”

“After brother Tao hung up the phone, he contacted the public relations department and continued to comment on the release of the release, maintaining song Chenyu’s persona.”

“Fortunately, song Chenyu had a large number of fans. After some fans saw the release of the release, they firmly believed that song Chenyu was also one of the victims.”

“After all, this matter had nothing to do with song Chenyu.”

Song Chenyu’s response did not mention ye Zhuo at all. Song Yiwan was the one who started all of this

“If song Yiwan had not suddenly posted on Weibo to accuse Ye Zhuo, things would not have turned out this way.”

“Song Chenyu browsed through the comments one by one. When he saw that the comments of the netizens were no longer as intense, his expression eased up a little.”

“After ye Zhuo finished processing the last order, he turned around and looked at Cen Shaoqing. “Have you been busy recently?””

Cen Shaoqing silently closed the video conference that had just been connected. His thin lips opened slightly. “No.”

“On the other end of the screen, looking at the video that had suddenly been cut off, the shareholders looked at each other. They could see the confusion in each other’s eyes.”

“They had been with Cen Shaoqing for a long time, but this was the first time they had seen him having a problem during a video conference.”

“At the last moment when the video went off, they seemed to have heard something.”

It sounded like a girl’s voice.

Was It a girl?

The shareholders had long heard that Cen Shaoqing was in love.

“But they had never seen the legendary female lead, and they did not dare to confirm it.”

“After all, for a man like Cen Shaoqing, who was pure-hearted and abstinent, who ate vegetarian and chanted Buddhism all year round, it seemed a little impossible for him to fall in love.”

“Should we call the fifth master again?”

“Hearing this, everyone looked at each other. No one dared to make a decision casually.”

“Cen Shaoqing seemed to be very refined, but in fact, he was temperamental.”

He was not someone to be trifled with.

“But if he didn’t call Cen Shaoqing, what would happen to the next meeting?”

“At this moment, special assistant Liu pushed open the door and came in. “Fifth master has an urgent matter to deal with. Today’s video conference is canceled.””

“When he said this, everyone started discussing.”

Cen Shaoqing wasn’t the type of person to casually cancel a meeting.

“Moreover, this meeting was so important.”

Could it be that they had encountered some thorny matter?

The heart of a monarch was unpredictable.

“The few shareholders discussed for a long time, but they could not come up with anything.”

“On the other side, Cen Shaoqing turned to look at ye Zhuo and continued, “Leader, do you have any plans?””

“Ye Zhuo said, “I heard that Changling Island in the east continent is quite interesting. If you have time, let’s go over and take a look. I just received a notice from the director that ‘Village 2’will be able to continue recording after half a month.”” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Sure.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

The next day.

Ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing set off for Changling Island.

Changling Island was a small fishing village.

“The environment on the island was especially good, and the people were simple and honest.”

Ye Zhuo booked a boarding house.

The owner of the boarding house was an elderly couple.

They had no children.

They were especially enthusiastic.

“Although the couple was already over 70 years old, they recognized ye Zhuo at a glance.”

“”Little girl! I know you! You’re Ye Zao, Right?””

Ye Zao nodded. “Yes.”

“The old lady held ye Zao’s hand and continued, “Ye Zao, when we were watching the program, the old couple liked you very much. I didn’t expect you to be more beautiful in person than on TV!””
