“Chapter 1507: 319: being seen through by da Zao, a slap in the face! 4”

“Wu Mei was not worried at all. Although ye Zao was young, he was steady in doing things and knew his limits much better than her. Sometimes, when Wu Mei stood in front of ye Zao, she even had the illusion that ye Zao was the Elder.”

“Zhang Zhenzhen continued, “Sister-in-law is right. Our little twelve is a promising child. I believe that she will be able to successfully complete the aircraft carrier project! When the time comes, let those countries that look down on China see what a truly big country is!””

“Yang Wenyin frowned slightly, “I still feel that little twelve’s bet agreement should not be signed. Who can guarantee that the aircraft carrier project will be successfully completed? What if something goes wrong in the middle and it is postponed?”Yang Wenyin’s worry was not unreasonable, the risk of this betting agreement was too great. Ye Zhuo was only 20 years old this year. If he failed, with the betting agreement, how would she be able to climb back up in the future?”

“”Don’t be afraid. Little twelve will definitely be fine.”Zhang Zhenzhen said, “In last year’s science and technology competition, little twelve even won first place! If little twelve wasn’t confident, he wouldn’t do such a reckless thing.””

“Yang Wenyin said, “That’s true. Since the betting agreement has been signed, it’s useless for us to worry. We might as well choose to trust Little Twelve.””

“Xia Xiaoman said, “Third sister-in-law is right.””

Sun Jiayi stood at the side and listened to their conversation.

“Of course, she knew about Dr. YC’s aircraft carrier plan. She also knew that ye Zao had signed a betting agreement with several countries. However, she didn’t expect ye Zao to be Dr. YC.”

He was also engaged in scientific research and was also a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner. Just how capable was this Ye Zhuo?

Sun Jiayi was very curious.

“In her opinion, ye Zhuo did not know any traditional Chinese medicine at all. He knew traditional Chinese medicine. It was just a method that she used to package herself.”

How could anyone be so powerful? He knew both traditional Chinese medicine and scientific research.

It was good to have money.

Anything could be packaged.

“Thinking of this, Sun Jiayi’s face was full of envy.”

“But soon, she would also become a rich lady. In the future, her son would be the second generation of the rich. From her generation onwards, their family would completely turn the tables and change their fate.”

“After a while, the sound of footsteps could be heard outside the door again.”

“An Lizi stood up from the sofa and said with a face full of joy, “It must be burning!””

She ran outside and saw that it was indeed ye Zao and the others.

“Lin Jincheng, Ye Shu, and Lin Ze walked in front.”

“”Uncle, aunt!”An Lizi immediately went over to greet them. “Ah Ze!””

“Lizi.”

“An Lizi looked behind the three of them and asked doubtfully, “Eh, burning didn’t Come?””

“Ye Shu nodded. “Yes, burning happened to have something on today, so he didn’t come today.””

“Hearing that, an Lizi’s face was filled with disappointment. “Ah! is that so! Why didn’t searing tell me on Wechat?””

“”Kenmeng must be too busy,”ye Shu said.”

“I see.”An Lizi lowered her head and said dejectedly.

“Seeing that, Ye Shu smiled and said, “I’m just teasing you. Searing is here. He’s behind Shaoqing to get something! It’s your birthday, how could searing not come!””

“Really?”An Lizi said with a face full of surprise.

“Yes.”Ye Shu nodded.

“”It’s in the parking lot, right?”An Lizi asked.”

“Yes.”

“An lizi smiled and said, “Then I’ll go over and take a look!””

“After saying that, an Lizi quickly ran in the direction of the parking lot.”

“Ye Zhuo looked at her back and said with a smile, “This child.””

“When they arrived at the parking lot, they saw ye Zao and Cen Shaoqing walking over.”

Cen Shaoqing was carrying a bunch of things in his hands. Ye Zao was walking beside him with Cen Shaoqing’s Buddha beads in his hands. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Big Zao Zao!”An Lizi said excitedly.

“Lizi.”

The two little girls hugged each other excitedly.

Cen Shaoqing looked at the people hugging each other and silently lowered his head to look at the road.

“An Lizi said, “Zhuozhuo, what are the big and small bags of things you asked brother-in-law to take? I see that uncle, aunt, Ah Ze, and the others have already taken a lot of things. Why did you guys take so many!””

“Ye Zhuozhuo said, “A few uncles and aunties haven’t come for a long time. Besides your birthday present, there are also gifts prepared for them.””

“”OH.”An lizi nodded and continued, “Brother-in-law, can you carry so many things? Let Me Help You!””

“”No need, I can do it.”Cen Shaoqing said.”

Ye Zao smiled and held an Lizi’s arm. “Let’s go. He’s stupid and strong. Don’t worry about him.”
