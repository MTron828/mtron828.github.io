Translator: 549690339

“Cen Jiang took a step forward. “I’m sorry, Professor Yue. I Can’t listen to your orders before Miss Ye Comes!” ”

“If he sped up the operation and shut down the nuclear reactor, what would happen to the aircraft carrier project? ”

“As the head of large C zone, he had the responsibility to protect large C zone! ”

“Cen Jiang! I’m ordering you in the name of the CEN Base Professor!”Professor Yue’s expression was very ugly.

“Cen Jiang stood straight. “Professor Yue, I still stand by my words. Before Miss Ye arrives, I will not let anyone touch anything in the large C District!” ”

Professor Yue was so angry that his entire body was trembling. “Do you know the consequences if the nuclear reactor is leaked? You’re joking with the lives of everyone in the base!”

“”Professor Yue, don’t worry. Miss Ye will definitely arrive before the nuclear reactor is leaked.” ”

“On the phone, ye Zao specifically instructed him to protect the nuclear reactor. No matter what, he could not let ye Zao down! ”

“Tang Xue said in a timely manner, “Cen Jiang, Professor Yue is also an old leader of the base. is her words less important than miss ye’s? Now even Professor Yue can’t order you around?” ”

“Tang Xue’s words ignited the anger in Professor Yue’s heart. She felt that her authority had been challenged. Just as Tang Xue had said, she had been in the base for so many years and was still a leader. Could it be that she was not as important as ye Zhuo? ”

“All these years, she had made so many contributions to the base. What had Ye Zhuo done? ”

But now.

She couldn’t order Cen Jiang around!

It had to be said that Tang Xue had used this trick of sowing discord to perfection.

Professor Yue held back the anger in his heart and gave Cen Jiang a slap.

“Slap!”

“This slap was clear and loud, and everyone was stunned. ”

Especially Tang Xue.

“She had followed professor Yue for so many years, but she had never seen professor Yue so angry. ”

“When she looked up again, Cen Jiang’s face was already swollen with a palm print. ”

“Professor Yue said with a cold face, “I’ll ask you again, are you going or not?” ”

“”Professor Yue is really impressive!”At this moment, a light voice came from the air, followed by the sound of footsteps. ”

“Everyone looked back and saw a slender figure coming against the light. It was hazy, and some people could not see her face clearly, but the powerful aura around her made people suck in a breath of cold air. ”

At the same time.

The sirens that covered the sky and Earth suddenly stopped at this moment.

Danger averted!

Tang Xue was stunned.

Ye Zao didn’t Run?

Professor Yue was also a little surprised when he saw ye Zao.

Why was the alarm averted the moment ye Zao Came?

What did she do?

Cen Jiang’s eyes lit up. “Miss Ye.”

“Ye Zao nodded slightly. When he passed by Tang Xue, he raised his hand slightly. ”

“Slap!”

A slap landed on Tang Xue’s face. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Tang Xue was stunned!

“Everything happened too quickly. By the time everyone reacted, Tang Xue’s face was already swollen with a palm print. Looking at it this way, it was somewhat terrifying. ”

“No one had expected ye Zao to suddenly make a move, and even less expected that ye Zao would hit someone. ”

“Ye Zao! What are you doing?”Professor Yue glared at Ye Zao.

“Ye Zao pinched his wrist. “Whatever professor Yue was doing, I was doing!” ”

It was obvious.

She was venting her anger on Cen Jiang.

“After saying that, Ye Zao raised his hand again and slapped Tang Xue. “Professor Yue owed Cen Jiang that slap just now. This slap is to sow discord between you! Miss Tang, remember to be careful with your words and actions in the future!” ”

“Tang Xue’s eyes were filled with stars and she almost lost her balance. Fortunately, Professor Yue was able to support her in time. “Little Xue!” ”

“Tang Xue used her hand to support her head. She felt that her entire head was numb, and her ears were buzzing. Tears of grievance flowed down her face. ”

On what basis!

On what basis did ye Zhuo hit her?

“Unfortunately, Tang Xue did not have the slightest ability to fight back. ”

“Professor Yue raised his head to look at Ye Zhuo, his face devoid of any color. “Ye Zhuo! You, you’ve gone too far!” ”

“Although ye Zhuo had hit Tang Xue, this was worse than hitting professor Yue’s own face. ”

“As the saying goes, one had to look at the owner before hitting a dog. ”

Who did not know that Tang Xue was brought up by her!

“But Ye Zhuo, ye Zhuo actually dared to hit Tang Xue in front of her today! ”

Wasn’t this rubbing against her face on the ground?

Too Much!

This was simply too much!

“”Coming to our C zone to flaunt your might and hit people, who exactly is the one who went too far?”Ye Zao raised his chin slightly. There was clearly no expression in his eyes, but it made people feel a chill down their spine, “I have never had any good points. I just like to protect my own shortcomings. If you dare to bully people from our C zone again, it won’t be as simple as a slap!” ”
