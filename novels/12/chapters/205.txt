“But she wasn’t sure if ye Sen was acting for her, so she couldn’t fall out with Wang Chenglei yet. ”

“Thinking of this, Li Yiyi smiled at Wang Chenglei. “Brother Wang, I have an appointment with my best friend. We’re going to buy clothes later. Why Don’t you go back first? I’ll Meet You At Your Place Tonight!” ”

“Wang chenglei said, “Why are you going back? I’ll go with you guys!” ”

“”No, no, no!”Li Yiyi began to act coquettishly. “Brother Wang, if we two little girls get together and buy some lingerie or something, I’ll be fine. With You by my side, my best friend will definitely be embarrassed.” ”

No man could resist a woman’s coquetry.

“Wang Chenglei was very happy to be coaxed. He stood up and said, “I’ll wait for you at home tonight.” ”

“Okay.”Li Yiyi kissed Wang Chenglei on the face.

“After Wang Chenglei left, Li Yiyi sat in the coffee shop until ye Sen and CEO Qian walked out of the private room. ”

The cooperation was discussed very smoothly. Ye Sen’s face was full of smiles as he sent CEO Qian out of the coffee shop.

Li Yiyi quickly stood up and followed him outside.

“Then, she saw Ye Sen get into a Mercedes-benz! ”

The latest mercedes-benz!

It was impossible to get it without three million.

“Li Yiyi held back the excitement in her heart. She didn’t go to Ye Sen right away. Instead, she hailed a taxi from the roadside and quietly followed ye Sen’s car. ”

“After all, luxury cars could be rented. ”

Who knew if ye Sen rented it!

“Soon, Ye Sen’s car stopped at the headquarters of Shengdong Express Company. ”

Li Yiyi frowned.

“After all this, Ye Sen was still a lousy courier! ”

She really thought ye Sen had made a fortune!

So he was pretending!

“At this moment, Li Yiyi suddenly saw two people who looked like assistants respectfully walk to Ye Sen’s side and take the briefcase from him. ”

What was going on?

She watched as the three of them disappeared into the company entrance.

Li Yiyi’s frown deepened.

“In order to figure out what was going on, Li Yiyi pushed open the car door and got out of the car. She also came to the company. ”

The hall was decorated very luxuriously.

“The moment Li Yiyi entered, a receptionist came over to receive her. “Madam, May I help you?” ”

“Li Yiyi looked around the hall and continued, “Is Ye Sen an employee here?” ”

“”You mean CEO Ye?”The receptionist smiled and said, “CEO ye is the boss of our company.” ”

What?

Ye Sen is the boss of this express delivery company?

Li Yiyi was completely dumbfounded!

“”You, you, you aren’t joking with me, right?”Li Yiyi continued to ask. ”

“”Madam, why would I joke with you about something like this! Right, are you looking for our CEO Ye?”The receptionist continued to ask. ”

Li Yiyi quickly nodded.

She wanted to see ye Sen immediately!

She wanted to get back together with Ye Sen!

“Ye Sen was the boss of this express delivery company, so she would be the lady boss in the future. ”

“Thinking of this, Li Yiyi was ecstatic. ”

She would be a member of the upper class in the future!

That’s great!

“The receptionist continued, “Do you have an appointment?” ”

Appointment?

“As a boss, she was indeed different. She even had to make an appointment for a meeting. ”

“Li yiyi frowned and said, “An outsider wants to make an appointment. Do I have to make an appointment too? Hurry up and bring me to see ye Sen. Otherwise, I’ll get him to fire you!” ”

“The receptionist frowned and said, “I’m sorry, Madam, who are you?” ”

“Li Yiyi raised her chin high and said, “I’m Ye Sen’s girlfriend! Your Future Boss’s wife!” ”

Ye Sen’s girlfriend?

The receptionist looked Li Yiyi up and down.

“She felt that this person’s image, temperament, and conversation were not worthy of Ye Sen. ”

He was too common!

“Moreover, they had worked in the company for so long, but they had never heard of Ye Sen having a girlfriend. ”

Could it be that he was here to offer himself to her?

There were too many shameless people nowadays.

“The receptionist smiled apologetically. “I’m sorry, Ma’am. Without an appointment, I can’t bring you to meet our CEO Ye.” ”

Li Yiyi did not expect the receptionist to not have the foresight at all. “Just you wait! I’ll let you take your bag and leave immediately!”

“”Ma’am, can you please leave?”The receptionist made a ‘please’gesture. ”

“Of course, Li Yiyi refused to leave. ”

She was the person that Ye Sen loved the most!

Ye Sen would definitely help her vent her anger!

“Helpless, the receptionist could only call for security. ”

“Li Yiyi was dragged out in the end, “How dare you! You’re really too daring! Do you know who I am? I’m the person that your boss Ye Sen loves the most! Let me tell you! You’re all finished! I’ll let ye Sen fire all of you one by one!” ”
