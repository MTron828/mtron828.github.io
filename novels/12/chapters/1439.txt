Chapter 1440: 307: We don’t have professor Yue Here! 3

Translator: 549690339

Ye Zao had offended Professor Yue so badly. How could professor Yue forgive him so easily?

“This time, even if ye Zao was not expelled from the base, he would still lose a layer of skin. ”

“Thinking of this, Tang Xue suddenly felt that her face did not hurt anymore. “Xu Guo, where is Professor Yue Now?” ”

“Xu Guo said, “They have already left the base.” ”

“After saying that, Xu Guo continued, “Oh right, sister Xue, brother Wang asked me to give you this ointment. He said it has a miraculous effect on reducing swelling and removing blood stasis.” ”

Tang Xue reached out to take it. “Help me thank him.”

“”Okay.”Xu Guo nodded. “Sister Xue, if there’s nothing else, I’ll be leaving first.” ”

“You can leave first.”

Xu Guo turned around and left.

“Just as she walked out of the office door, she saw Wang Lei standing at the corner waiting for her. ”

“Brother Wang.”Xu Guo jogged over.

“Wang Lei asked, “Did you give that ointment to Tang Xue?” ”

“”I did.”Xu Guo nodded. “Don’t worry. Can I not do what you asked me to do, brother Wang?” ”

“Wang Lei rubbed his hands and said a little embarrassedly, “About that, is Tang Xue Alright?” ”

“”She’s fine. Don’t worry.”Xu Guo smiled and said, “If you’re worried, you can go in and take a look yourself. Sister Xue isn’t a tigress, what are you afraid of!” ”

“When he heard this, Wang Lei felt even more embarrassed. ”

“Xu Guo continued, “Brother Wang, you won’t be able to get a girlfriend like this!” ”

“Wang Lei scratched his head. “I, I’ll be leaving First!” ”

“At this moment, Xu Guo continued, “Then, brother Wang, Wait a moment.” ”

“Do you have anything else?”Wang Lei asked.

“Xu Guo continued, “Sister Xue asked me to say thank you.” ”

Thank you.

“Tang Xue’s thank you made Wang Lei’s face turn red. “No, you’re welcome!” ”

“After saying that.., ”

xu Guo smiled as she watched Wang Lei’s back.

“Wang Lei was a rare talent in the base, but he was more introverted. He did not like to talk much and did not have many friends in the base. ”

He was a loner.

“If Wang Lei did not have a crush on Tang Xue, Xu Guo would have wanted to chase after him. ”

“It was not because she liked Wang Lei, but because she felt that a man like Wang Lei would be very loyal and responsible after marriage. ”

What a pity.

Xu Guo looked at Wang Lei’s back and shook her head regretfully.

In the office.

“After Tang Xue applied the ointment, she turned on her laptop and logged into the international scientific research forum. She switched to her alternate account and anonymously posted a post. ”

“[ after the aircraft carrier, the Dark Horse of the scientific and technological world, Dr. YC, stirred up trouble again. He actually used a nuclear reactor as the fuel for the aircraft carrier! ] ”

“In the post, there was an exaggerated description of how ye Zao preserved the Nuclear Reactor and how he guaranteed that he could use the nuclear reactor to build an aircraft carrier that was faster than the speed of light. ”

Normal people knew that a nuclear reactor could not be used as fuel.

An aircraft carrier used either fuel or nuclear power.

“At the bottom of the post, the researchers from various countries were jeering. ”

[ Dr. YC? Is it the Chinese who made such a big claim to build an aircraft carrier? ]

“[ yes, it’s her! ] ”

[ has her aircraft carrier been built? ] Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“[ China can’t even build a spaceship, let alone an aircraft carrier! ] ”

“[ the person above is lying! Just watch the show, I haven’t seen such a funny joke in many years! It’s so funny! ] ”

“[ light speed? Oh My God, she really knows how to Brag, reaching light speed can directly travel through time and space! The space carrier is huge, how to ascend is a difficult problem, and YC actually wants to reach light speed! Speechless! ] ”

“[ light speed is currently the fastest speed visible to the naked eye. On average, it can reach 300,000 kilometers per second. In other words, from China to C country, this YC can reach it in the blink of an eye! ]! [ does she even know what the concept of light speed is? ]? [ even if she wants to brag, she can’t brag like this, right? ]? [ this bragging is going to the sky! ]! [ I wouldn’t dare to do this even in my dreams! ] ”

“Not to mention 300,000 kilometers per second, even if she could create an aircraft that could fly at 300,000 kilometers per hour, it would still be a miracle in the world ”

“300,000 kilometers per hour? Not to mention the fact that humans are currently unable to achieve that, even if it were another 100 years, it would still be impossible ”

“What are you guys talking about, brother Ji? An aircraft that could fly around the earth once would only be 40,000 kilometers. 300,000 kilometers would be enough to fly around the earth 7-8 times! Could it be that YC could fly around the earth for 7-8 times in the blink of an eye ”

“At this year’s science and Technology Exhibition, I saw YC once. She was very young. I have to admit that her looks were indeed stunning. She was very beautiful, but judging from her age, she should not be more than 18 years old! However, I was stunned. I did not know how she got first place! I also did not understand why there were so many big shots in science and technology circling around her. After seeing the news that she was going to build an aircraft carrier, I was not surprised. Bragging is also a type of strength. Ordinary people, who can make the big shots in the Tech World Go Round and round? ] ”
