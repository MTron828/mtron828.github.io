“Chapter 1451: 309: all members are expelled, too late to regret! 3”

Translator: 549690339

“”There’s no mistake,”Han nan continued, “There’s a report on the base’s official website regarding the specific situation. You can go and see for yourself.””

“After saying that, Han nan directly hung up the phone.”

“Sun Yu stood in the same spot, blood flowing backwards all over her body. Her face was like dead wood and ashes, unable to muster any strength at all.”

How could this be...

How could this be!

Someone at the side heard Han Nan’s words clearly and immediately opened the official website.

“As soon as he opened the official website, a message popped up.”

It was a notice about the strike in their research lab.

All members were removed.

Including professor Yue.

“In other words, professor Yue could have enjoyed the benefits of retirement.”

But now.

“She was directly dismissed. Not only did she not enjoy any benefits, but she was also given a big demerit in her research career!”

“Some people could not bear the blow and directly knelt on the ground, crying bitterly.”

It was not easy to enter the CEN base.

“Out of ten thousand ordinary people, only one person was qualified to enter the CEN base.”

“In order to enter the CEN base, they had gone through five obstacles and killed six generals. It was not easy for them to get to where they were today.”

“Among them, some people entered the CEN base and even became the glory of the entire family.”

But now...

They had actually been expelled from the base.

“Not only had they been expelled, but the notice also stated that these people would never be able to join the CEN company again!”

They had already been blacklisted by master five. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

One had to know that almost two-thirds of all the scientific research institutes in China were developed by the CEN family.

“Once they were blacklisted by the Cen family’s base, it meant that they were blacklisted by all the scientific research institutes.”

Regret.

Very much regret.

“In order to threaten master five, they had sacrificed their own future. How could they not regret this?”

These people who regretted things in the past also included Sun Yu.

“Just an hour ago, he was still dreaming of being promoted and getting rich.”

Who would have thought.

“An hour later, things had changed.”

“”We were wrong, we really were wrong!”A middle-aged man walked in front of Sun Yu, “Little Sun, you usually have the best connections in the base. Go and help us beg master five. Ask him to forgive us once. We won’t dare to do it again in the future!””

“”Old Yang is right. Brother Sun, go and do it. We’ll beg master five!””

How Could Sun Yu meet master five?

“If he could meet master five, he wouldn’t have fallen to such a state!”

“Seeing that Sun Yu did not speak, some people began to blame her. “It’s all your fault! If it weren’t for you fanning the flames and mobilizing all of us to go on strike, we wouldn’t have come to this stage! It’s all your fault! It’s all your fault!””

“”Yes, it’s all Sun Yu’s fault!””

Some people even began to kick and punch Sun Yu.

“At first, Sun Yu was still sitting there, not resisting or speaking. But later, she could not hold it in anymore and stood up, she roared, “Could it be my fault alone? You’re all adults, Can’t you think for yourself? Now that there’s a problem, blame it on me!””

“Actually, this matter really couldn’t be entirely blamed on Sun Yu.”

“Although the strike was instigated by Sun Yu, the people in the research lab still valued their position in Zone B too much. They felt that they were irreplaceable, so they could do whatever they wanted. They tried to use this matter to threaten CEN Shaoqing, to achieve a raise in salary and a promotion.”

“In the end, it was still their own problem.”

Sun Yu did not know how she got home.

“When Mother Sun saw her son like this, she said nervously, “Xiao Yu, what happened to you? Did Something Happen to you?”Just Yesterday, Sun Yu was happy to say that she was going to be promoted soon. She did not expect things to turn out like this today.”

Sun Yu hugged her mother and burst into tears.

“Mother sun was extremely anxious, “What’s wrong, Son? Tell me what happened! Did Someone Bully You?””

“After a long while, Sun Yu finally told Mother Sun about the matter.”

“Hearing this, mother sun frowned deeply, then, she said, “You can only go to professor Yue for this matter. After all, you were the one who instigated the strike for her. Go and look for her. She has worked in the CEN base for more than 20 years and has a wide network. She will definitely be able to help you!””

“It’s useless.”Sun Yu shook her head. “She is like a Clay Buddha crossing the river. She can’t even protect herself now. How can she control me?”

Mother Sun Sighed. “Then what should we do?”

“At this moment, mother sun seemed to have thought of something. Her eyes lit up and she continued, “You can look for Linlin! Linlin has been in the CEN base longer than you. Maybe she can think of a way to help you.””

“”But I’ve already broken up with her,”Sun Yu said.”

“”It’s okay, son.”Mother Sun held Sun Yu’s hand, “Didn’t you just tell me last night that Linlin looked for you? If she came to look for you, it means that she has you in her heart! Go look for her now and apologize to her. Tell her that you’re wrong and she will definitely forgive you!””
