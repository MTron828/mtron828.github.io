An unfilial descendant!

This unfilial descendant!

“Seeing these things, the little bit of guilt in old Mrs. Lin’s heart disappeared. ”

It was better to chase Lin ze out now than to let him harm the Lin family in the future.

As long as she was here!

No one could harm the Lin family!

“The housekeeper was extremely anxious, he hurriedly explained, “Old Madam, you’ve really misunderstood the young master! This isn’t poisonous powder at all! This small bag is filled with powdered sugar, and these are flour! And this is refreshing chewing gum! Aren’t you going to celebrate your 80th birthday soon? That’s why the young master has been studying the birthday cake for the past few days. He said that you’ve worked so hard to raise him up, and he wants to be filial to you! “At your birthday banquet, he will give you the cake that he personally made! “That’s why he asked me to secretly buy an oven and send it over ”

“”In order to give you a surprise, he has been secretly studying the birthday cake in his room for the past few days! In order to make the cake, he doesn’t even rush to write his homework. Every night, he is busy until the middle of the night, and he needs to rely on chewing gum to refresh himself ”

“The young master is doing this for you! Why do you think that the young master is smoking du?”

“”Old Lady, you are too muddle-headed!” ”

“Hearing this, Old Lady Lin was immediately stunned. Her face was pale. ”

“How, how could this be? ”

Could it be that she misunderstood Lin Ze?

“”Old Lady, if you don’t believe me, you can take a look and see if this is poisonous powder!”The housekeeper took a bag and handed it to Old Lady Lin. ”

“Old Lady Lin took the bag with trembling hands, dipped her hand in it, and tasted it. ”

It was sweet.

It was sweet.

It was powdered sugar.

It really was powdered sugar.

So this child really wanted to celebrate her birthday.

What should she do?

What should she do now?

“Old Lady Lin instantly panicked, and her heart was filled with regret. ”

It was all her fault!

She had wronged a good child!

What should she do now?

Old Mrs. Lin was on the verge of tears. She wished she could slap herself to death just now.

How could she have hit the child just now!

And she had even said such hurtful words.

“Lin Ze was so filial, but he was wronged by her. The child must have felt terrible. ”

Old Mrs. Lin was as angry as she was now.

She should not have hit the child so indiscriminately!

“”Housekeeper!”Old Mrs. Lin grabbed the housekeeper’s hand and said in a trembling voice, “Go and Chase Ah Ze! Go! Ah Ze’s temper is like Jin city. He’s very impulsive! You mustn’t let anything happen to him!” ”

If something happened to Lin Ze because of this.

“Then even if she died, she wouldn’t feel at ease! ”

“”Okay, old Mrs. Lin, I’ll go now!” ”

Old Lady Lin looked at the butler’s back and anxiously wiped away her tears.

Feng Qianhua and Feng Xianxian were dumbfounded.

They thought that they could completely chase Lin ze out of the Lin family this time.

They did not expect to be tricked by Lin Ze!

Good!

Very good!

“Feng Qianhua was so angry that her face turned pale, but she had to hold it in. ”

Lin Ze was indeed the son of that b * Tch ye Shu!

Feng Qianhua reached out and pushed Feng Qianqian.

“Feng Qianqian immediately understood and walked in front of Old Mrs. Lin with red eyes. “Grandma Lin, I’m sorry. It’s all my fault. I didn’t know brother Ah Ze was making a birthday cake for you... I’m sorry... Please Scold Me...” ”

“Old Mrs. Lin Sighed and said with tears in her eyes, “This is mainly my fault! I didn’t ask clearly. I’m sorry to Ah Ze! I’m sorry to Jin City...” ”

Although Old Mrs. Lin didn’t explicitly point out that Feng Xianxian was to blame for this matter.

But today’s matter did indeed start because of Feng Xianxian.

“If it wasn’t for Feng Xianxian, Old Mrs. Lin definitely wouldn’t have wronged Lin Ze for no reason. ”

“Thinking back to what Lin Ze had said, Old Mrs. Lin only felt a mess in her heart. ”

“Aunt Zhang hurriedly stood out and said, “Old Mrs. Lin, actually this matter is still my fault! When I passed by young master’s room and saw these things, I didn’t know that they were flour! I’m Sorry!” ”

“Actually, who could be blamed for this? ” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

It was all Old Lady Lin’s fault!

Who told her to listen to the wind and listen to the Rain? She didn’t even believe her own grandson.

“She didn’t even trust Lin ze, how could she expect outsiders to believe her? ”

Aunt Zhang’s words had another meaning. Old Lady Lin wanted to find a problem with her.

This matter had nothing to do with anyone.

“Feng Qianhua saw the hesitation in Old Lady Lin’s eyes, she held Feng Xianxian’s hand and said, “Aunt Lin, I know that you like Xianxian, but what happened today was indeed Xianxian’s fault. She shouldn’t have been gossiping in front of you and made you misunderstand ah ze. I’ll bring Xianxian to Ah Ze now. Don’t worry, we’ll definitely find Ah Ze!” ”
