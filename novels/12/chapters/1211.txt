Chapter 1212: 257: Ye Zhuo saved Han Dongliang and cured him! 8

Translator: 549690339

Zhao Xueyin soon found out that ye Zhuo had cured Han Dongliang.

Zhao Xueyin immediately reported the matter to Father Zhao.

Father Zhao was not too anxious when he heard this. He had sent people to inquire about Han Dongliang’s condition.

Even Miracle Doctor Liu was helpless. How could ye Zhuo Cure Han Dongliang?

Father Zhao’s lips curled into a smile. “What are you panicking for? This is a good thing for us!”

“”A good thing?”Zhao Xueyin continued, “Dad, as far as I know, Ye Zhuo is indeed skilled in medicine. What if she really cures Han Dongliang? What should we do then?” ”

“Father Zhao continued, “The Han family has invited all the famous doctors for Han Dongliang’s illness. They even brought Han Dongliang to C country, where medicine is the most developed. Do you think ye Zhuo can be better than the famous doctors at home and abroad?” ”

“Hearing this, Zhao Xueyin heaved a sigh of relief. ”

That’s right!

Ye Zao’s medical skills could be better than the experts?

“An illness that even the experts were helpless about, could ye Zao be cured? ”

“Father Zhao continued, “Go and check again, how was ye Zao diagnosed! Did she use the Bezoar Pill?” ”

“Currently, the Bezoar Pill was their only opponent. ”

“Ye Zao was a doctor himself. According to ye Langhua’s connections, it should not be difficult to obtain an authentic bezoar pill. ”

“Alright.”Zhao Xueyin nodded and immediately sent someone to investigate.

“This matter was not a secret in the Han family. Zhao Xueyin immediately found out about it, “Dad, the cause of ye Zhuo’s diagnosis is completely different from the other doctors. The Han family has already demolished the sterile room!”! Ye Zhuo also said that the bezoar pill would not have any effect on an Dongliang’s condition, so he did not plan to use it.” ”

“Hearing this, father Zhao heaved a sigh of relief. “Good! Good! That’s great! If that’s the case, the Han family will just have to wait to collect Han Dongliang’s corpse!” ”

“When Doctor Ye Zhuo died, he would also have to take responsibility. ”

“To Father Zhao, this was killing two birds with one stone! ”

...

Time passed very quickly.

“In the blink of an eye, it was the third day of Han Dongliang taking the medicine. Similarly, today was also the day for him to run for the first seat. ”

“Early in the morning, Han Laoshan stood by Han Dongliang’s bed, hoping that Han Dongliang would wake up. ”

“As long as Han Dongliang could wake up today, it meant that ye Zao’s medicine was useful. ”

“At that time, Han Dongliang could vote for ye Zao in the election. ”

“On the other hand, if Han Dongliang did not wake up, Han Laoshan would have to consider voting for Zhao Xueyin. ”

“After all, the Zhao family had bezoar pills! ”

“However, as time passed, Han Dongliang showed no signs of waking up. ”

“Han Laoshan was very anxious. He said in a hoarse voice, “Dongliang, open your eyes and take a look at Dad. Just take a look, okay?” ”

“Han Dongliang, who was lying on the bed, showed no reaction. ”

“At this moment, Mrs. Han walked in from outside. “Old Han, don’t you have a meeting today? Go to the meeting first. I will stay at home and keep an eye on Dongliang. I will inform you as soon as there is any news!” ”

Han Laoshan nodded. “Then I’ll go to the meeting first.”

“Go.”

“After Han Laoshan came to the consortium, he called Mrs. Han again. “How is it? Has Dongliang woken up yet?” ”

“Not yet.”Mrs. Han’s sigh came from the other end of the phone.

Han Laoshan’s expression also became extremely gloomy.

“”Uncle Han, you can’t really believe that Ye Zhuo can cure Big Brother Han, right?”At this moment, Zhao Xueyin walked over from the side. ”

Han Laoshan hung up the phone. “H-how did you know?”

“Zhao Xueyin did not directly answer Han Laoshan’s question. Instead, she asked, “We agreed on a three-day period, but brother Han has yet to wake up. Don’t you think this is very strange?” ”

Han Laoshan frowned.

“Zhao Xueyin continued, “Actually, Ye Zao is using you, using your love for your son. “The reason why she said three days is because today is the day of the chief election. If you believe her, you can vote for her in the meeting later. “However, let me be clear. Once you vote for her, you can’t blame me for not saving her.” ”

The last sentence made Han Laoshan break out in cold sweat.

What should he do?

What should he do now?

Who should he trust?

“Han Lao Shan grabbed his hair with both hands, his face full of helplessness. ”

Was Ye Zhuo lying to him?

Han Lao Shan didn’t know what to do either... ...

“At this moment, Han Lao Shan’s phone rang. ”

Han Lao Shan picked up the call. “Hello.”

“He didn’t know what was said on the other end of the phone, but Han Lao Shan’s expression changed. “What?” ”

“Really?”

“Then, Han Laoshan collapsed to the ground. ”

He burst into tears.

“Zhao Xueyin looked at Han Laoshan, her eyes full of pride. ”

This call must be from the Han family.

“Seeing Han Laoshan like this, Han Dongliang must be in deep trouble. ”

He might already be dead.

“Otherwise, Han Laoshan would not be crying like this. ”

Karma!

This is karma!

Who told Han Laoshan not to believe her?
