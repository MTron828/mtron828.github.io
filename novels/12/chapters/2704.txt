Yao Cuifen didn’t feel that there was anything wrong with ye Shu coming to pick her up.

“No matter what, she was ye Shu’s mother. ”

She was the one who raised ye Shu.

“If it weren’t for her, Ye Shu wouldn’t be where she is now. ”

“Moreover, Zhou Ziyue helped her upload the video. ”

“So, Ye Shu would definitely come to pick her up and live a good life! ”

“Thinking of this, Yao Cuifen was very excited. ”

“”Pick you up? Ye Shu wants to kill us all right now! Don’t even dream about it!”Ye Sui’s emotions were already on the verge of collapse. Now that he heard Yao Cuifen’s whimsical words, how could he still hold back. ”

“”Kill Us All?”Yao cuifen frowned and said, “Does she think that she can control everything in the capital?” ”

“Ye Sui continued, “It’s all because you were too good to her back then!” ”

“Of course, ye Sui was being sarcastic. ”

“Because ye Shu was not related to Yao Cuifen at all. Back then, Yao Cuifen treated ye Shu worse than a servant. She often beat and scolded her, and sometimes she didn’t even give her food. That was why ye Shu was forced to work before she was an adult, it was also because she lacked love that ye Shu fell in love so quickly when she met Lin Jincheng. ”

“”Little Sui, what do you mean by saying these things now?”Yao Cuifen asked. ”

Ye Sui took out his phone. “Go and see for yourself.”

Yao Cuifen took the phone. There was an interview video on the phone. “Isn’t this Buttface’s grandmother and Sanzhu’s mother? Why are they on TV?”

“At this moment, Buttface’s grandmother began to speak. ”

“”You Mean Shu! I know that child! She’s the third daughter of the old ye family.” She sighed, then she said, “Speaking of which, that child is also pitiful. She only had such parents. Who knows how much suffering she had to endure when she was young! She was not even half a person tall, yet she had to cook for the whole family and wash their clothes! She didn’t even finish junior high school before she went to work! The Old Ye couple are really not human!” ”

“”I also know about Shu. Shu is a good child, but it’s a pity that she didn’t give birth to a good family. The Old Ye couple still have the nerve to acknowledge their daughter. If it were me, I would have long found a hole to hide in!” ”

“I already guessed that Shu is not the biological child of the Old Ye family! It seems that my guess is right!”

“”Although Shu wasn’t their biological daughter, since they adopted Shu, they should be responsible for her!”! “You don’t know how pitiful that child was when she was young. It was winter, and she didn’t even have a pair of shoes. Her feet were red from the cold. In the end, Aunt Ge couldn’t stand it and gave her daughter’s shoes to her!” ”

“I’m relieved to see that Shu is doing well now!”

“...”

“The surrounding people were all talking at once. Even without ye Shu’s appearance, they knew that ye Dafu and Yao Cuifen did not treat ye Shu well back then. ”

“In order to find out what kind of person ye Shu was, the media specially arranged for reporters to go to Ye Shu’s hometown for an interview. Only then did the scene on the screen appear. ”

“”Nonsense! They’re talking nonsense!”Yao Cuifen was hopping mad. “These gossipy women, B * tches, only they know how to talk, right? Ziyue! Ziyue, take a video for me!” ”

“It had been so many years since the incident, so how could they have any evidence that she had abused ye Shu. ”

“In court, they still had to pay attention to witnesses and evidence! ”

“With a mouth under her nose, would they be the only ones who knew how to speak? ”

She would also speak!

Yao Cuifen’s greatest ability was to make the dead into the living.

Zhou Zi Yue raised her head to look at Yao Cuifen. “It’s useless. My video account has already been blocked.”

“Due to the distortion of the truth and the destruction of other people’s reputation, Zhou Ziyue’s video account had been blocked. ”

“”How could this be?”Yao cuifen continued, “Then what about your rich boyfriend?” ”

Zhou Ziyue did not speak.

“Are You Mute?”Yao Cuifen was so angry that she pushed Zhou Ziyue.

Zhou Ziyue did not speak.

Ye Sui did not speak either.

“Seeing that the two of them didn’t say anything, Yao Cuifen was so angry that she started cursing, “You Useless Thing! Did you offend them? ! I knew you didn’t have a rich life! Did you come all the way here just to make us look bad?” ”

“At this moment, Yao Cuifen appearing in Beijing was no different from making a fool of herself. ”

...

On the other side.

At the Lin family manor.

Ye Shu was sitting on the sofa with her phone in her hand. Her face was filled with shock. “Oh my God! The direction of the wind has really changed!”

The netizens from before were all on ye Dafu’s and Yao Cuifen’s side.

“Coincidentally, this was ye Zhuo coming down from his spin. Ye Shu turned her head to look at Ye Zhuo. “Zhuozhuo!” ”

“”What’s wrong, Mom?”Ye Zhuo asked. ”

“Ye Shu continued, “Did you arrange these videos on the Internet?” ”

“No.”Ye Zao shook his head slightly. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Then what did they do?”Ye Shu was very curious.

Ye Zao smiled faintly. “Because justice is in the heart of the people.”

Ye Shu’s face was filled with emotion.

“In fact, all these years, Ye Zao had been using ye Shu’s name to help those people from Yun Jing’s hometown. After all, these people had done ye Shu a favor in the past. ”

“Now that ye Shu’s reputation had been wronged for no reason, they definitely had to speak up for ye Shu. ”

“”Ahhh!”Bai Jingshu walked in from outside with the child in her arms. When she saw ye Zao, the baby in her arms shouted excitedly, “Ahhh!” ”

“Little Tiezhu!”

Ye Zao walked over with a smile and reached out to carry him.

“The child was only two months old, but he already recognized people and was exceptionally close to Ye Zao. ”

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “Speaking of which, tie Zhu, your brother, and I aren’t as close as you are!” ”

“Really? Does little tie Zhu already know Auntie?”

“Little tie Zhu could not speak, so he could only babble a few times, as if echoing ye Zao’s words. ”

“”Sister-in-law, is tie Zhu a little overweight?”The child was only two months old, but he was already heavy in his arms. ”

“Bai Jingshu nodded. “18 pounds! The doctor also said that he’s a little overweight, so he asked me to control my appetite a little.” ”

“Under normal circumstances, a two-month-old child would weigh around 10 to 15 pounds, but the little tiezhu weighed 18 pounds. ”

“I have to control it.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Ye Shu stood up from the sofa. “It’s a blessing to be able to eat. It shouldn’t be a problem for him to be fatter, right?”Ye Shu was a little reluctant to part with such a young child who had to go on a diet. ”

“After all, she was a grandmother. It was normal for her to feel sorry for her grandson. ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Mom, it’s just to let the baby eat less. It’s not like I’m not letting him eat anymore. Besides, it’s better to eat less than fatty liver, right? It wouldn’t be good if such a young child gets fatty liver and it affects his health.” ”

“Hearing this, Ye Shu nodded. She walked over and took the small iron pillar from ye Zhuo’s arms. “Everyone says that our iron pillar is fat. I don’t think he’s fat.” ”

“Lin Ze walked in from outside. Hearing this, he smiled and said, “He’s not fat? He’s already a ball!” ”

“Who says that about their own son!”Ye Shu rolled her eyes at Lin Ze.

“Lin Ze smiled and said, “He is. The Doctor said to control his weight.” ”
