“The little assistant continued, “My parents are civil servants. They gave birth to me relatively late. They’re already over 60 now.” ”

“Speaking up to this point, the little assistant’s emotions suddenly broke down. “I’m not a good daughter! I actually don’t even know how old they are...” ”

“Usually, she was always busy with work. When she was resting, she was busy watching movies and shopping with her friends... ... She didn’t spend much time with her parents. ”

“At the thought of this, the little assistant felt terrible. ”

“”You’ll know when you ask them later. It’s not too late to make amends.”Yu Zifei continued, “Remember to be filial to your parents in the future.” ”

“”But can we still go back?”She was afraid that when she saw her parents again, it would be at her memorial service. ”

Would she still have a chance to be filial to her parents?

“If God was willing to give her another chance, she would definitely find time to accompany her parents and be filial to them. No matter when or where, she could not let the regret of being filial to her parents be left behind. ”

“”We can go back.”Yu Zifei nodded and continued, “Trust me.” ”

“Seeing the determination in Yu Zifei’s eyes, the little assistant also nodded. She hoped that she could really go back. ”

Another Day.

“Although time passed very quickly, it was very difficult for Yu Zifei and the little assistant. ”

“Without water or food, the two of them were almost exhausted. They could only lie on the ground and look at the sky. ”

“The Little Assistant’s eyes were desperate and desolate, and her voice was weak.”... today is the fourth day. Miss Ye and the others should have already stopped searching.” ”

“Perhaps on Earth, the research base was already holding a memorial service for them. ”

“”They won’t,”Yu Zifei said. ”

“The assistant smiled and continued, “Team leader Yu, shall we discuss something?” ”

“Go ahead.”

“The assistant continued, “If I die before you, I’ll stand by the side and wait for you for a while. If you die before me, you stand here and wait for me for a while.” ”

“”... Alright?”At this point, the little assistant turned to look at Yu Zifei. ”

“Yu Zifei did not directly answer the little assistant. Instead, he said, “Miss Ye will definitely come and save us.” ”

Definitely!

“The little assistant quickly continued, “I’m afraid of the dark and also afraid of ghosts. Team leader Yu, you must wait for me.” ”

“As she was nearing death, the little assistant was no longer afraid. In fact, she was even looking forward to it. After all, once she died, she would no longer have to endure the pain. All she had left now was regret. ”

In her next life.

“If there was a next life, she would definitely be filial to her parents. ”

“”Li Xiang, be strong.”Yu Zifei turned around and looked at Li Xiang. “We have to believe in Miss Ye and the base!” ”

“”Team leader Yu, I’ve already been strong for five days.”She did not even know how she had passed these five days. ”

Time passed like years.

“”Team leader Yu,”Li Xiang continued, “I feel that I’m already very strong and amazing. I can understand why Miss Ye gave up on the search and rescue. I Don’t blame her, really...” ”

Mars was not like Earth.

“After disappearing from Earth for five days, they could still find some streams and wild vegetables in the wild to satisfy their hunger, but this was Mars! ”

The sand on the red planet was like a rock.

“Today was already the fifth day. Even if ye Zao did not open up and give up on the search and rescue, the other people in the base would not agree. After searching for five days, they still did not find anything. If they continued to search, it would only be a waste of time. ”

“”Believe me, Miss Ye will not easily give up on anyone. Just hold on a little longer, Miss Ye will come and save us soon!” ”

“The little assistant smiled at Yu Zifei. “Team leader Yu,”she said ”

“Meanwhile, at the Mars base in the Western Hemisphere. ”

“In order to find Yu Zifei and the little assistant, Ye Zhuo had not slept for five days and five nights. At this time, he looked a little tired. ”

The air was filled with the sound of typing.

“She used the instrument to scan the entire Mars, but she could not find Yu Zifei and the little assistant. ”

Could it be...

That they were blocked by something?

Ye Zhuo frowned slightly.

“At this moment, CEN he walked in with some food. “Miss Ye, please have some food and rest for a while.” ”

Ye Zhuo retracted his mouse and extended one hand towards CEN he. “Just give me a bottle of nutrient solution.”

Eating was a waste of time.

CEN he felt a little helpless.

“Tang Mi followed him in and said, “Miss Ye, this is the dessert I specially brought for you. Why don’t you have some dessert first?” ”

“Put it there.”Ye Zhuo took a sip of the nutrient solution.

“Tang Mi’s eyes were filled with worry. “Miss Ye, you haven’t slept for five days and nights. Just Rest for a while. Leave the task of finding old Yu to me.” ”Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com
