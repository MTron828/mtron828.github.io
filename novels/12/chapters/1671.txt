“After a while, professor Feng looked up at director Ma and said firmly, “Okay, I promise you.” ”

“Really?”Director Ma’s eyes lit up.

Professor Feng nodded.

“”Then let’s Go Now!”If Jamila knew that he had successfully solved professor Feng’s problem, she would definitely appreciate him more. ”

Professor Feng followed director Ma’s footsteps.

The two of them came to the main hall of the restaurant.

“Seeing the two of them return, Jamila immediately stood up from her chair. “The two of you are back.” ”

Director ma nodded.

“Professor Feng was too lazy to play tai chi with Jamila, so he went straight to the point, “Dr. Jamila, if we agree to cooperate with you, are you sure that you will bring us to Europa as soon as the lightspeed aircraft carrier is built?” ”

“”Of course.”Jamila nodded, “To be honest, our research department has been studying Europa for many years. However, we haven’t found a way to land. As long as we can land, we will definitely land on Europa as soon as possible!” ”

“Actually, Jamila was also very curious. China did not land on Europa, so why would ye Zao oppose them landing on Europa. ”

“However, this also happened to help them! ”

“If ye Zhuo agreed to the plan of landing in Europe, then Feng Qi and Ma Jianbang would definitely not betray ye Zhuo. ”

“After saying that, Gamira took out a contract from her bag. “If you two don’t trust me, we can sign the contract on the spot.” ”

Director Ma picked up the contract and looked at it carefully.

This contract was absolutely beneficial to him and professor Feng.

“The contract promised not only to help them change their nationality, but also to help their whole family emigrate and provide them with a generous living guarantee. ”

“Take a look.”Director Ma handed the contract to Professor Feng.

Professor Feng took the contract and didn’t say anything.

She was still hesitating.

She couldn’t get over it.

“Seeing this, Camilla smiled and said, “Professor Feng, I heard that your daughter is currently applying for emigration, right?” ”

“Yes.”Professor Feng nodded.

“Professor Feng’s daughter, Feng Ying, was 35 years old this year. She was a fashion designer who did not have much talent. She had worked hard in country L for many years, but unfortunately, she had not made much progress. Recently, feng Ying was preparing to move to country C! ”

“Gamira smiled and said, “I can let your daughter work in the International Fashion Department.” ”

International Fashion Department?

“When he heard this, professor Feng’s eyes lit up. ”

“Although she didn’t know much about the design world, she knew that the international fashion department was the paradise that every fashion designer dreamed of. ”

“Including Feng Ying, she also wanted to study in the international fashion department very much. ”

“Unfortunately, Feng Ying didn’t have enough qualifications and hadn’t been able to get in. ”

“Now that he heard what Jamila said, Professor Feng was very moved. ”

“Professor Feng’s subtle expressions were all seen by Jamila. She smiled and said, “Professor Feng, I never make a big deal for others. Don’t worry, since I promised you, I will definitely do it.” ”

“Director ma continued, “Professor Feng, why are you still hesitating! ! Hasn’t Ying Ying always wanted to study in the international fashion department? This is a rare opportunity. Moreover, it’s a good opportunity to take advantage of this to repair the rift between you and your mother.” ”

“Professor Feng had divorced in her early years. She was a strong woman who had to work hard and earn money to support her family. It was inevitable that she did not care enough about her children. In addition, girls were much more meticulous than boys. Therefore, over the years, feng Ying had a lot of opinions about professor Feng! ”

She did not even return to her country to see Professor Feng for a long time.

“Director ma continued, “The international fashion department is in C country. In the future, when you settle down in C country, you will be able to see Ying Ying often. This is also a form of compensation for Ying Ying. It’s not easy for Yingying to work alone for so many years!” ”

“Hearing this, professor Feng immediately picked up a pen and signed the contract. ”

“In the first half of her life, she had already neglected her daughter. In the second half of her life, she wanted to make up for all her regrets! ”

“For Feng Ying, and for her lifelong dream! ”

Killing two birds with one stone.

“Seeing that Professor Feng had signed the contract, director Ma and Camilla looked at each other and saw a satisfied look in each other’s eyes. ”

“Camilla put away the contract and extended her right hand to Professor Feng. “Professor Feng, I wish us a happy cooperation.” ”

“A happy cooperation.”

It was already two hours later when they left the restaurant.

Professor Feng’s mood was a little low as they walked on the busy road. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

She had never done anything guilty in her life.
