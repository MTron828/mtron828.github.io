Old Lady Cen was furious.

Xie wanqiu actually asked ye Zhuo to apologize.

“The most unreasonable person she had ever met was Old Lady Lin. She thought that other than Old Lady Lin, there was no other person in the world who was more disgusting than Old Lady Lin. ”

Who would have thought.

“There was no such thing as the most disgusting, only more disgusting. ”

“Compared to Old Lady Lin, this Xie Wanqiu was simply worse than her! ”

“Old Lady Cen was so angry that she did not even want to eat her favorite melon seeds. She placed her hands on her hips and was about to curse, “I want to see if Xie Wanqiu is really willing to die in the hospital!” ”

Zhou Xiang looked at Old Lady Cen and did not know how to speak.

On one side was her mother-in-law.

On the other side was her stepmother.

And on the other side was her future daughter-in-law.

She was in a dilemma on three sides.

“After saying that, old Mrs. Cen turned to look at Zhou Xiang. “Xiang Xiang, I’m telling you, don’t tell this terrible thing to burning!” ”

“”Okay.”Zhou Xiang nodded at first, then as if she thought of something, she continued, “Then, then what if my mom really doesn’t want to be discharged?” ”

Xie wanqiu would do anything.

“If she really stayed in the hospital and didn’t come out, Father Zhou would definitely not let it go. ”

Zhou Xiang had been afraid of Father Zhou since she was young.

“”With someone like Xie wanqiu, does she deserve to be a Mother?”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “It’s all thanks to you treating her as your biological mother all these years! But what about her! How did she treat you? Did she treat you as her biological daughter? Other than doing disgusting things, what else would she do?” ”

“At the end of her sentence, old Mrs. Cen continued, “If I were you, I would have cut off all ties with her long ago! is she that kind of person who keeps cutting off all ties for the New Year?” ”

Zhou Xiang lowered her head.

She could not say a single word.

“Seeing Zhou Xiang like this, old Mrs. Cen sighed. ”

She was her daughter-in-law.

Everything was good.

She was just too soft-hearted.

“Therefore, all these years, she had been unable to stand up. Therefore, all these years, all the big and small matters of the Cen family had been handled by her alone. ”

“As she grew older and older, there were many times when she was unable to do what she wanted. ”

“She really hoped that Zhou Xiang could grow up. After Cen Shaoqing and ye Zao got married, Zhou Xiang would be able to help manage the family and take charge of everything. ”

“After a moment, Zhou Xiang raised her head to look at Old Madam Cen. “Mom, then... then are you really going to ignore her?” ”

Zhou Xiang knew Xie Wanqiu too well.

“Xie wanqiu was a person with a very stubborn temper. She was used to being the head of the Zhou family. If anyone did not live up to her expectations, she would really cause a ruckus! ”

“This time, since Xie Wanqiu had said such harsh words, she would not be discharged from the hospital. ”

She would really keep her word!

“Don’t bother about her!”Old Madam Cen’s attitude was resolute.

She wanted to see if Xie wanqiu could really stay in the hospital for the rest of her life.

Zhou Xiang was still a little worried. “But... But...”

“”No buts,”old Mrs. Cen said. “Just listen to me and ignore her. Maybe she’ll come back tomorrow!” ”

What kind of shameless person like Xie Wanqiu wouldn’t do?

It was fine as long as Xie Wanqiu didn’t come back on her own.

“If she came back on her own, old Mrs. Cen would definitely not let her in easily. ”

“Zhou Xiang said, “I’m not worried about anything else. I’m just worried that something might happen to her in the hospital.” ”

She was Xie Wanqiu’s stepdaughter.

Xie Wanqiu was also in the capital when something happened to her.

“When that happened, she would not be able to clear her name even if she jumped into the Yellow River. ”

“”What could happen to someone like Xie Wanqiu?”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Do you really think that she would be willing to die in the hospital?” ”

Xie Wanqiu was now living a life of superiority.

“Father Zhou was like Zhou Xiang, soft-hearted. Xie Wanqiu was in charge of all matters in the Zhou family. ”

“At this time, Xie Wanqiu was willing to die? ”

How was that possible!

“Even if the sky fell, Xie Wanqiu would not die. ”

“After saying that, old Mrs. Cen continued, “If she is really willing to die in the hospital, then I will definitely buy a string of firecrackers to celebrate!” ”

“After saying that.., old Mrs. Cen added, “Oh Right, Xiangxiang, don’t go to the hospital during this period of time! Don’t take the initiative to apologize on behalf of burning! If I find out, Don’t blame me for turning hostile!” ”

“At this critical moment, if Zhou Xiang went to the hospital to surrender, then Xie Wanqiu would definitely climb up the pole! ”

She could not be spoiled.

“Got it.”Zhou Xiang nodded.

“Since things had come to this, Zhou Xiang could only listen to old Madam Cen. ”

...

At the hospital.

“Zheng Wanyin sat by the bed and fed soup to Xie wanqiu. “Grandma, what should we do? Isn’t it a little inappropriate?” ”
