His exquisite phoenix eyes were bottomless and glistening.

“After a moment, he turned around and looked at the girl lying on the bed. The corners of his mouth curled up slightly. ”

“In this quiet night, some people were happy while others were sad. ”

“Because there was no lawyer in the country who dared to accept Li Shuyi’s case, Li Erzhu and Linda had to ask someone to hire a lawyer abroad. ”

“Unexpectedly, no one in C country dared to accept it. ”

“After hearing the news, Li Erzhu was completely dumbfounded. ”

“If there was no lawyer to defend Li Shuyi, Li Shuyi would face 10 months in prison. ”

Although 10 months was not much.

“But Li Shuyi was, after all, Li Erzhu’s only daughter. ”

“In the future, Li Shuyi would marry into a high-class family. ”

“Once a stain was left, it could not be erased. ”

No family was willing to let a woman who had been in prison enter their home.

“Therefore, Li Shuyi absolutely could not go to prison. ”

“Left with no choice, Li Erzhu could only beg Li Sanzhu and Fang yinyue. ”

“After all, Cen Wuye was Li Erzhu’s guest. As long as Cen Wuye said something, Li Shuyi would be fine. ”

Li Erzhu went to look for Li Sanzhu.

“Li Sanzhu shook his head. “Second brother, I’m sorry. I really can’t help you with this!” ”

“Shuyi is your only niece!”Li Erzhu looked at Li Sanzhu. “Do you want to watch her go to jail?”

Was there not even the slightest bit of kinship in Li Sanzhu’s eyes?

“Li Sanzhu frowned slightly. “Second brother, Shuyi offended fifth master Cen! Who Do you think I am? Can I speak to Fifth Master Cen?” ”

“”But fifth master Cen is your family’s guest after all!”! “Third brother, second brother has never begged you for anything. This is the first time. I’m begging you to help Shuyi. Shuyi is still young. It’s normal for a child to make some mistakes. I promise you, she won’t dare to do this again in the future!” ”

Li Erzhu was very regretful now. He regretted that he had agreed to Linda’s plan in a moment of hot-headedness.

“Li Sanzhu continued, “Second brother, I’ve said it. It’s useless for you to beg me about this matter. The person Shuyi has offended is fifth master Cen! If I could speak in front of Fifth Master Cen, I wouldn’t be in this state now!” ”

“Third brother! Are you going to let her die?”Li Erzhu looked at Li Sanzhu with incomparable pain.

Li Sanzhu didn’t speak anymore.

He had already said what he needed to say.

“”Erzhu, let’s Go! Don’t beg him!”Linda walked over and grabbed Li Erzhu’s wrist. “Just treat it as if our Shuyi doesn’t have such a third uncle!” ”

Li Erzhu was pulled away by Linda.

Only when he was pulled out of the door by Linda did Li Erzhu shake off Linda’s hand. “Why are you pulling me! Are you going to watch our daughter go to jail?”

“Linda narrowed her eyes. “I can see that Li Sanzhu doesn’t treat you like a brother at all! Even if you kowtow to him, he won’t agree to it!” ”

“Then what should we do?”Li Erzhu asked.

“Linda continued, “There’s only one person who can help us now.” ”

“Who?”Li Erzhu asked. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Linda replied, “Mom.” ”

“Hearing this, Li Erzhu’s eyes lit up and he slapped his forehead. “Why didn’t I think of that just now? !” ”

Li Sanzhu could not listen to anyone but Old Mrs. Li.

Li Erzhu immediately contacted Old Mrs. Li.

“After hearing this news, Old Mrs. Li bought a plane ticket early the next morning and rushed back from abroad. ”

Li Erzhu and Linda went to the airport to pick up the old lady.

“Old Mrs. Li, who was seventy or eighty years old this year, looked very energetic. Her silver hair was completely dyed black. Looking at her like this, she was much younger than her actual age. ”

“”Mom!”Seeing Old Mrs. Li, Linda added fuel to the fire and recounted the entire process. ”

“Hearing this, Old Mrs. Li was very angry, “Third brother and third sister-in-law are really too much! They simply don’t Take Me, this old lady, Seriously! Don’t worry, the two of you. Since I rushed back from C country, I will definitely make the decision for you!” ”

“”Thank you, Mom.” ”

Old Madam Li then went to Li Sanzhu’s residence.

“Seeing his mother, Li Sanzhu was very surprised. “Mom, Why Are You Back?” ”

“”Why can’t I Come Back? I am your mother, and this family also has my share!”Old Madam Li looked at Li Sanzhu and continued, “I see that you have already forgotten about me, this mother!” ”

“”I don’t dare, I don’t dare. Mother, how could I Forget About You!”Li Sanzhu continued, “Please come in with me quickly.” ”

“After saying this, Li Sanzhu looked at the servant beside him. “Quickly go and inform Madam and miss.” ”

“Hearing the servant say that Old Lady Li had come back, Fang yinyue’s scalp went numb, and she subconsciously felt that something bad was going to happen. ”

“Old Lady Li had always been unreasonable, and she had come back at such a critical time. It was easy to guess her intentions. ”

Fang yinyue came to the front hall and smiled. “Mom.”
