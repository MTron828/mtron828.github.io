Translator: 549690339

“After coming out of the police station, Gu Si looked at ye scorch. “Miss Ye, thank you for today!” ”

“”You’re welcome.”Ye Scorch’s eyes were indifferent. “If it were anyone else today, I wouldn’t have stood by and watched.” ”

“After saying that, Ye Scorch looked at Gu si and continued, “Worker Gu, you’ve made my eyes light up today. There will be a reward for your efforts. If you persevere, your future will definitely be bright!” ”

“Actually, Ye Zhuo had noticed Jiamila and gu si the moment they came in. He hadn’t said anything all this while because he wanted to see what Gu Si would choose. ”

“Jiamila’s treatment was very good. Very few people could resist that kind of temptation, but Gu Si had done it! ”

“”Thank you, Miss Gu!”Gu Si was very excited and bowed to ye Zhuo. ”

“Work hard.”Ye Zao patted Gu si on the shoulder and turned to leave.

“Gu Si looked at ye Zao’s back, her eyes full of determination. ”

“She would definitely work hard and not let ye Zao Down. For a moment, Gu Si was filled with hope for the future. ”

On the other side.

“Jamila had never thought that because of Gu Si’s matter, he would be sent to prison! ”

He never thought that he would fall into the hands of a Chinese.

Jamila knocked on the iron window.

“I want to see my lawyer!”

Dr. Cara must have a way to get him out!

Definitely!

“On the other side, when Tina brought Feng Ying to China, she received the news that Jamila was in prison. ”

Tina frowned.

How could this be?

“She had only been away for a few days, how could Jamila go in? ”

“In this situation, Tina could not go directly to the prison to visit Jamila. She could only ask Cara. ”

“On the other end of the computer screen, Cara lit a cigar and said slowly, “I already know about this.” ”

“Cara had many spies. Almost as soon as Jamila went in, Cara received the information. ”

“”What should I do now?”Tina continued, “Do I need to bail Jamila out?” ”

“Not for the time being.”Cara flicked the ashes on the cigar. “I’ve already arranged for Roger to come over. You and Roger can cooperate with each other for the rest of the matters.”

Tina frowned slightly. “What about Jamila?”

“To Cara, Jamila was already a useless pawn. However, she still had to do enough to maintain her reputation. She could not leave any evidence behind. ”

“Carla looked up at Tina, then, she said, “Jamila and you are both my right-hand men. Naturally, I will not abandon him. Don’t worry, I will do everything I can to save him. “The most important thing for you and Roger now is to bring back the National Treasures of the Song dynasty and Gu Si.” ”

“Okay.”Tina nodded.

“After hanging up the video, Tina closed her computer and went to Feng Ying’s room. ”

“Feng Ying was on the phone with her friends in China. When she saw Tina coming over, she immediately hung up the phone and looked back at Tina. “Miss Tina.” ”

“Tina nodded. “When are you going to visit your grandmother, Miss Feng?” ”

“Feng Ying said, “Tomorrow.” ”

“”Sure,”Tina continued, “I’ll say it again. Whether or not Miss Feng can take the position of vice-minister of the International Fashion Department will depend on your performance this time.” ”

The Minister of the International Fashion Department?

“Hearing this, Feng Ying’s eyes lit up. “Miss Tina, don’t worry. I’ll definitely get the Jade.” ”

“Okay.”Tina nodded.

“After saying that, Feng Ying continued, “But Miss Tina, are you really sure that my grandmother has the Jade?” ”

She grew up in front of the old lady and had never heard of any national treasure of the Song dynasty.

“”Yes, I’m sure.” ”

Feng Ying nodded. “As long as you’re sure that there’s such a thing.”

“The old lady only had one granddaughter. Not to mention the National Treasure of the Song dynasty, as long as she wanted it, even if she wanted the old lady’s life, the old lady would give it to her with both hands. ” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Although the National Treasure of the Song dynasty sounded quite valuable, Feng Ying never cared about money. She only wanted to enter the international fashion department and become the leader of the International Fashion Department. It was her lifelong dream! ”

“As long as Carla could make her a deputy minister, she was willing to do anything! ”

“Early the next morning, Feng Ying arrived at the villa with bags of nutritional products. ”

“When she saw Feng Ying, Auntie Wu thought she was seeing things! ”

This!

This is Feng Ying!

Why Is Feng Ying Back?

“Feng Ying didn’t come back to fight for the property, did she? ”

What should she do now?

Wu’s face turned pale!

“What are you waiting for! Where is my grandmother?”Feng Ying looked up at the villa.
