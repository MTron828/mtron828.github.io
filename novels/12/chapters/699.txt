“Chapter 700: 158: it’s the New Year! A show of affection, a secret of the Xi family for half a month! 1”

Translator: 549690339

Master Yu had taken in two disciples in his life.

“The eldest disciple was very mysterious and had never shown his face in front of outsiders. However, the outside world knew that the eldest disciple was also a dragon and Phoenix among men. He was better than the blue, but unfortunately, his ambition was not in the literary world. ”

The youngest disciple was ye Zao.

Ye Zhuo’s talent was witnessed by the Lin family.

“Although ye Zhuo had not participated in the literary world’s assessment competition yet, the Lin family believed in ye Zhuo very much. Ye Zhuo would definitely be able to pass the assessment competition smoothly. ”

Just the words written by Ye Zhuo were not something that ordinary people could compare to.

Duan Duan Duan stood beside ye Zhuo and clapped excitedly. “Amazing! Aunt is so amazing! Aunt is really amazing! If only I was as amazing as Aunt!”

“Ye Zhuo finished writing a couplet and looked down at Duan Duan. “Duan Duan, then Auntie will teach you how to write a couplet, okay?” ”

“Okay.”Duan Duan nodded.

Ye Zhuo carried Duan Duan and held his hand as he started to write.

The other four little fellows were envious of Duan Duan. They kept nagging ye Zhuo to teach them as well.

Ye Zhuo carried the four little fellows one by one and taught them how to write couplets.

“In a short while, he finished five couplets. ”

The five little ones took the couplets that they had written and insisted on pasting their own couplets on the door of their respective bedrooms.

Lin Qingxuan picked up the first couplet that ye Zao had written and pasted it on the door of the Lin family manor.

Lin Jincheng followed him to paint paste.

“Ye Zao’s handwriting was graceful and majestic. Paired with the magnificent door of the Lin family manor, it looked extremely magnificent. ”

Lin Jincheng looked at ye Zao’s handwriting with pride on his face.

“As soon as the couplet was affixed, a black car slowly drove over and stopped at a parking spot on the side. ”

“A moment later, the car door was opened and a young man in a black down jacket walked out. ”

“The young man got out of the car, walked around to the passenger seat, and opened the passenger seat door. ”

A middle-aged man in a suit walked out of the car.

The two of them walked towards Lin Qingxuan and Lin Jincheng.

“”Dad, fourth uncle.” ”

“Ah Ze is back.”Lin Jincheng looked up at the two of them.

“Ye Sen smiled and said, “Brother-in-law, fourth brother.”Lin Qingxuan was Lin Jincheng’s fourth brother, so ye Sen also followed behind and called him fourth brother. ”

“Sen.”Lin Jincheng nodded.

“Lin Qingxuan looked at ye Sen. “It’s the end of the year recently. Your company must be very busy, right?” ”

“Ye Sen continued, “It’s alright. A lot of the stations have stopped shipping recently, so it’s not very busy.” ” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“The express delivery company basically stopped shipping after the 29th of December. Under normal circumstances, they would wait until the 8th of the new year to resume shipping normally, so ye Sen was quite free during this period of time. ”

Lin Qingxuan nodded. “I’ve been busy for a year. I can take advantage of this time to rest more.”

“Lin Jincheng looked at Lin ze and said, “AH ze, take uncle to his room to rest. Your fourth uncle and I will go there to paste the couplets.” ”

“Okay.”

Lin Ze took ye Sen to the east courtyard.

“Ye Sen asked curiously, “Ah Ze, your uncles and Aunties are back?” ”

“Lin Ze nodded. “Yes, they come back every other year to celebrate the New Year.” ”

“Aren’t there a lot of people in your family this year?”

“”There are about 30 people in total,”Lin ze said casually. ”

More than 30 people celebrating the new year together?

Ye Sen swallowed his saliva.

The two of them talked as they walked to the east courtyard.

“When they reached the main hall, they saw ye Zhuo and the five little guys cutting the window flowers. ”

“”Uncle!”Seeing Ye Sen, Ye Zhuo stood up to greet him. ”

“”Big niece!”It had been a long time since he saw ye Zao, so ye Sen was very excited. ”

Little White followed behind ye Zao and imitated him. “Uncle!”

Ye Sen patted Little White’s head.

“Little White hid behind ye Zao and said with a look of disdain, “Uncle, you can’t just Pat Someone’s Head!” ”

“Why?”Ye Sen asked.

“Little White stuck out its cute little head from behind ye Zao. “Because if you pat someone’s head, they won’t be Smart!” ”

Ye Sen couldn’t help but laugh.

The five little guys politely called him uncle.

Uncle?

“Every time he heard this title, Ye Sen felt a little sad. He was already a grandfather, but he was still single. ”

“At this moment, ye Shu heard ye Sen’s voice and walked out. “Ye Sen, have you eaten? If you haven’t eaten, there’s still noodles in the pot. I’ll get some for you.” ”

“Knowing that Ye Sen would come in the afternoon, ye Shu specially left some noodles. ”

“Ye Sen smiled and said, “Sis, don’t worry about me. I’ve already eaten.” ”
