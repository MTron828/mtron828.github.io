“Chapter 1432: 306: face-smacking, Big Burning Domineering cover-up! 6”

Translator: 549690339

Cen Jiang looked at Ye Zao.

He was so excited that he felt that the wound on his face no longer hurt.

It was also at this moment that Cen Jiang felt that he had not chosen the wrong person.

“No matter what happened in the future, he would follow ye Zao unswervingly! ”

“Cen He, Cen Hu, and Cen Hai behind him were also very excited. ”

The other technical personnel at the side were even more excited.

“When professor Yue started to hit Cen Jiang, they thought that Cen Jiang would be slapped by Professor Yue for nothing. They did not expect that ye Zao would get everything back in the blink of an eye. ”

“Miss Ye was too aggressive just now!”

“The eyes of an old technician at the side were red. “Miss Ye is really a good leader...”if it was anyone else, they would definitely let it go. Who would care about the feelings of an employee? ”

But Ye Zhuo did not.

This meant that she valued everyone under her.

“Professor Yue was so angry that he was about to vomit blood. “Ye Zhuo, what right do you have to hit Xiaoxue! I want you to apologize to Xiaoxue immediately!” ”

“”Then what right do you have to hit Cen Jiang? In terms of status, Cen Jiang is not lower than Tang Xue. In terms of seniority, Cen Jiang is also not lower than Tang Xue!”Ye Zhuo’s tone was indifferent, “Professor Yue, this is Area C, not a place for you to show off. If you want to show off, go home and do it!” ”

Professor Yue choked and was so angry that she was about to have a heart attack.

How dare she?

How dare she!

“She had been in the base for a long time. When anyone saw her, it was not out of politeness. Other than Cen Shaoqing, no one dared to talk to her like that. ”

“However, ye Zao not only treated her with such an attitude, but he also publicly slapped her in the face, causing her to lose face in front of so many people. ”

Professor Yue could not swallow this insult.

“Ye Zao slowly put on his rubber gloves. “Two Rivers, three lakes, four seas, send professor Yue out!” ”

“Cen He, Cen Hu, and Cen Hai immediately stood up. “Professor Yue, Please.” ”

Professor Yue gave ye Zhuo a deep look before helping Tang Xue out of the storage room.

Elder Wu and elder Zhao immediately followed their footsteps.

“After walking out of the storage room, professor Yue comforted her, “Little Xue, the heavens will take away your freedom. Don’t worry, I will definitely help you get justice. I Won’t let you suffer in vain.” ”

“Aunt Yue!”Tang Xue didn’t even call her professor anymore. She hugged professor Yue and cried out bitterly.

“”Good child, Don’t Cry Anymore!”Professor Yue patted Tang Xue’s back ”

In the storage room.

“Cen Jiang walked in front of ye Zao and bowed deeply. “Miss Ye, thank you.” ”

“Ye Zao raised his head and glanced at Cen Jiang. “Not everyone can bully us in Area C. in the future, if anyone bullies you again, just beat them up! If anything happens, I’ll take responsibility!” ”

“After saying that, Ye Zhuo looked up at the others and said, “The same goes for all of you.” ”

“”Got it, Miss Ye!”Everyone answered in unison. ”

“Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and said, “Then, let’s Get to work! Dajiang, bring some people to check that side. erhe, you’re in charge of that side. Sanhu, Sihai, you go to the defense team and activate the Defense System!”Although she had temporarily deactivated the alarm.., for the sake of safety, she still had to check it again. ”

“Everyone had their own duties. Although they were busy, they were not in a mess. ”

“On the other side, after comforting Tang Xue, professor Yue hurried to Cen Shaoqing’s office. ”

If ye Zhuo did not give her an explanation for today’s matter...

It was not over!

“After all, she was an elder of the base. If ye Zhuo did this, how would she have the face to stand in front of everyone in the future? ”

Professor Yue had just walked to the door of Cen Shaoqing’s office when he saw a figure rushing out.

“It was Cen Shaoqing’s assistant, Zhou Yue. ”

“Seeing Professor Yue, Zhou Yue rushed up to him. “Professor Yue, you’re here! Master five just told me to look for you!” ”

“Master Five is looking for me?”Professor Yue looked up in disbelief.

“Yes.”Zhou Yue nodded. “Please follow me in.”

Why was Cen Shaoqing looking for her?

Was it because of ye Zao?

“After what ye Zao had done to her, could it be that Cen Shaoqing wanted to avenge her? ”

He did not expect Cen Shaoqing to not be at the scene. He was rather well-informed.

Professor Yue felt a little better when he thought that Cen Shaoqing would avenge him. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

She would personally ask Tang Xue to return the two slaps and then ask ye Zao to apologize to her.

“Zhou Yue knocked on the door. “Master Five, professor Yue is here.” ”

“Come in.”A deep voice came through the thick wooden door.

Professor Yue pushed the door open and entered.

Cen Shaoqing was sitting at his desk.

“Professor Yue walked over. “Master Five, you were looking for me?” ”

Cen Shaoqing threw out a piece of paper. “Take this and go to the personnel department to handle the retirement formalities.”

Retirement formalities?

“Upon hearing this, professor Yue’s face turned white. ”

She was only 48 this year and was not even old enough to retire. What was Cen Shaoqing trying to do?

Expel her?
