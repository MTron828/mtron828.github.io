“Chapter 479: 128: Ye Zao is z, brother and sister meet smoothly! 1”

Translator: 549690339

It was because ye Zao had applied for Peking University that Mr. Yang accepted the Peking University’s invitation to speak.

“He thought that ye Zao would definitely speak on behalf of the freshmen, but who knew that the one speaking on behalf of the freshmen was actually a young man that he did not know at all.”

“When he did not see ye Zao on stage, Mr. Yang thought that ye Zao had not come to Peking University and changed his choice at the last minute.”

He did not expect to see ye Zao off stage.

“After confirming that ye Zao was off stage, Old Master Yang quickly concluded his speech and impatiently went off stage.”

“Although Feng Xianxian had eaten with old master yang at the same table, there were too many juniors around Old Master Yang. How could he remember all of them?”

“Grandpa Yang.”Ye Zao stood up and greeted Old Master Yang.

Everyone’s gaze fell on Feng Xianxian. There was some meaning behind it.

“Some were curious, some were mocking, and some were watching the show.”

“Feng Xianxian originally thought that old master Yang was here to greet her. After all, Old Master Yang had some friendship with Old Lady Lin. During Old Master Yang’s birthday banquet, she even toasted to Old Master Yang.”

Who would have thought that old master Yang was here to greet ye Zhuo!

“How did this country bumpkin, Ye Zhuo, Know Old Master Yang?”

Feng Xianxian just stood there with an awkward expression on her face. She wanted nothing more than to find a hole to hide in.

Li Yueyue held back her laughter.

“Feng Xianxian relied on her status as the eldest daughter of the Lin family to strut around in the dormitory all day. She thought that she was superior, but in reality, she was just a clown.”

“This time, she finally got her comeuppance!”

“In front of so many people, she felt embarrassed for Feng Xianxian.”

Old Master Yang said a few words to Ye Zao and left with the school leader.

“Li Yueyue turned to look at ye Zao curiously. “Zao Zao, is old master Yang a relative of yours?””

Ye Zao nodded slightly. “A little.”

Li Yueyue was sitting to Bai Xiaoman’s left.

She frowned when she heard this.

Ye Zhuo’s mother was a waitress and her uncle was a courier. How could she possibly know Old Master Yang?

And they were relatives! ? VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Wasn’t this a fantasy?

“”Xianxian, what do you think Old Master Yang’s relationship with Ye Zhuo is?”Bai Xiaoman asked in a low voice.”

“Feng Xianxian said, “What does a person like her have to do with Old Master Yang? Didn’t you see Old Master Yang leave after saying a few words? He probably mistook her for someone else!””

“Yes, he must have mistaken her for someone else!”

“After all, elder Yang was so blind that even she couldn’t recognize him.”

It was normal to have mistaken him for someone else.

Feng Xianxian pinched her fingers.

“Bai Xiaoman nodded. “Xianxian, you’re right. Elder Yang must have mistaken her for someone else.””

“If ye Zhuo and elder Yang were really related, would ye Zhuo still be so poor?”

“He was wearing clothes without labels, a worn-out second-hand computer, and even his cell phone was an old model from last year.”

“He even liked to go to the cafeteria with Li Yueyue, eat street food, and even eat junk food like spicy hot pot!”

“Therefore, Grandpa Yang must have mistaken him for someone else.”

“After the orientation party ended, it was October 1st.”

Li Yueyue planned to go home for a seven-day long vacation.

“”Zhonghua, are you going home?”Li Yueyue asked as she packed her luggage.”

Ye Zhonghua lay in the hammock and squinted his eyes. “I’m not going home. My mom and uncle are here.”

“Li Yueyue continued, “You don’t have anything to do in the capital. Why Don’t you come with me to our prairie to play?””

“”What’s fun there?”In Ye Zao’s previous life, the environment was polluted and the weather was getting worse. The prairie was desertified. She had only seen pictures of the real prairie in a museum.”

“Li Yueyue counted with her fingers and said, “We can ride horses, roast meat, learn archery, and dance on the bonfire... in short, there are many, many, many fun things.””

“Ye Zhuo stretched out one leg and lightly kicked the bed frame. His long white legs were extremely slender, and even his feet were as white as jade. His pink toenails were like rows of pearls, and the hammock slowly swayed, “Eleven might not be able to do it. I have other things to do.””

This lively scene made Li Yueyue’s eyes widen.

This leg was too beautiful!

It was long and straight.

“It was like milk, without a single flaw.”

She could not help but think about how outstanding ye Zao’s boyfriend was to be worthy of ye Zao.

“”Zao Zao, is your boyfriend very good? Very Good?””

“Hearing this, Feng Xianxian and Bai Xiaoman pricked up their ears to listen to Ye Zao’s reply.”
