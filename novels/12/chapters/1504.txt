“The butler smiled and said, “”He’s the one who asked me to ask you!””! Master Feng had a son in his family. He was an only child. He was 25 years old this year, two years older than Jiayi. Not only did he get into graduate school, but he also graduated from a key university. He was now a civil servant. He saw that Jiayi was a good girl with a good character. She was excellent in all aspects, so he wanted to ask me to tell you... . .”””

“At this point, Sun knew what the housekeeper meant.”

“It turned out that master Feng took a fancy to Sun Jiayi, want to say Sun Jiayi to his daughter-in-law.”

“But Feng did not look at his own weight, her daughter is going to become a rich wife, Feng’s son is just a small broken civil servant, but also worthy of Xiao Sun Jiayi! He was simply a toad that wanted to eat swan meat! Shameless!”

“Auntie Sun’s stomach was full of anger, but she didn’t show it on her face, she smiled and said, “”As the saying goes, every family needs a daughter. This is a good thing. However, it’s useless for me to agree to such a thing. I have to ask Jiayi. Jiayi has to say yes.”””

“The Butler nodded in agreement, “”Of course!””! In fact, in my opinion, master Feng’s son was really not bad. A civil servant had an iron rice bowl, and his salary was more than 20,000 a month. His welfare was also good! Moreover, master Feng’s family only has one son. His family has a car and a house. When Jia Yi marries over, he doesn’t have to go to work. He just has to stay at home to help his husband and teach his son. If Jia Yi doesn’t want to help her husband and teach her son, she can become a little miracle doctor. Master Feng’s wife works in the hospital. Although the couple’s savings are not much, it is more than enough for them to start a small business! “”Why don’t you give me Jiayi’s wechat and let the two young people get to know each other on wechat first? What do you think?”””

Want Wechat?

Feng wanted Sun Jiayi’s wechat?

No Way!

He simply didn’t have the slightest self-awareness.

“””Butler, I’ll talk to Jiayi later. If she agrees, I’ll give you my wechat.”” Auntie sun continued, “”In fact, someone introduced someone to Jiayi before the New Year. The young man is a big boss. It is said that he is worth tens of millions of yuan. Jiayi did not agree.””” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The Butler was a smart person. He immediately understood the meaning behind Auntie Sun’s words.

She was looking down on Master Feng’s son!

It was just that she was embarrassed to say it out loud.

“Although Sun Jiayi was sensible and had a decent appearance, it would be a bit of an exaggeration to say that a big boss with a net worth of tens of millions had taken a liking to Sun Jiayi.”

“If there really was such a person, Sun Jiayi wouldn’t be working part-time in the villa.”

“Although master Feng’s son didn’t have a net worth of tens of millions, this condition was definitely not too bad in the capital.”

“Master Feng was a local in the capital. He had been a dessert chef for decades. Previously, he was the head chef of a five-star hotel. After he retired, he was hired by the Lin family. Now, not only did he have a salary, but he also had a pension, his wife was also a surgeon. His family had a car, a house, and a savings account.”

“In general, he could be matched with Sun Jiayi.”

“However, the meaning behind Auntie Sun’s words seemed to be that master Feng’s son could not be matched with Sun Jiayi.”

“The Butler thought that Auntie Sun and her daughter were kind people, so when master Feng came to look for them, he immediately agreed. He did not expect that there was still a layer of difference in the hearts of people.”

“Perhaps, Auntie Sun and the Auntie Sun that he knew were far from the same person.”

“At this point, no matter how much the Butler said, it was meaningless. “”Alright, Auntie Sun, you go ahead! I’m Going Out!”””

“””Okay.””Auntie Sun nodded.”

The Butler turned around and left. Auntie Sun snorted coldly.

Pah.

What the hell!

“If she did not want to leave a good impression in front of the servants, she would not even bother to pretend.”

These people were overestimating themselves.

It seemed that she had to quicken her pace and get Sun Jiayi pregnant as soon as possible so that some people would not shamelessly think about Sun Jiayi.

Auntie Sun walked to the kitchen and began to brew the medicine.

“After putting all the medicine into the medicine pot, Auntie Sun looked outside and saw that there was no one around. She quickly took out a small bag of white powder from her pocket and poured the white powder into the medicine pot.”

“This white powder was colorless and tasteless. Other than being infertile, it did not have any side effects on the human body. If she did not take it to the laboratory, there would be no problem at all.”

On the other side.

In the front hall.

“At 10:30 pm, guests were already arriving in the villa one after another.”

“The first to arrive were Lin Qingyang, the eldest of the Lin family, and Wu Mei and his wife.”

“Xia Xiaoman was downstairs to welcome them. “”Big Brother and sister-in-law, come in quickly. It’s very cold outside, isn’t it?”””

“Wu Mei smiled and said, “”It’s alright. It’s a little colder than the west continent. Why, haven’t the second, third, and fifth arrived yet?”””
