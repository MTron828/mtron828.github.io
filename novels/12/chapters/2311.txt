Wu Mei immediately picked up Lin Yang and walked out of the mourning hall.

“Seeing that Wu Mei’s expression was not right, ye Zhuo asked, “Aunt, what’s Wrong?” ”

“It’s all because of this little ancestor! I’m so angry!”Wu Mei lowered her voice and told ye Zhuo what had happened.

“Ye Zhuo said, “A child is not sensible. It’s okay for children to speak without fear.” ”

“”Mei!”At that moment, Lin Qingfan’s voice came from the air. ”

“What’s Wrong?”Wu Mei turned around.

“Come here for a moment. I have something to talk to you about!”

“Wu Mei was about to carry the child over when ye Zao stretched out his hand towards Wu Mei. “Auntie, give Yang Yang to me. I’ll explain to her.” ”

“”Okay.”Wu Mei handed the child to ye Zao. “Zao, I’ll have to Trouble You Then.” ”

“We’re all family.”

“Little Lin Yang immediately hugged ye Zao’s neck tightly and said coquettishly, “I like fairy auntie the most!” ”

Ye Zao carried Lin Yang and walked out.

“Lin Yang asked curiously, “Auntie, why can great grandma go to Heaven but I can’t?” ”

“Ye Zao explained, “Because once you go to that place, you’ll never come back.” ”

“Why?”

“”There are two states of being human. The first state is to be alive, and the second state is to be dead...” ”

Ye Zhuo was just halfway through his explanation when Cen Shaoqing’s voice sounded from behind him.

“Leader!”

Ye Zhuo looked back. “Weren’t you busy in front?”

“I’m not busy now.”Cen Shaoqing’s gaze landed on Lin Yang. This Little Brat’s hand was actually placed on ye Zhuo’s collar.

He was really too bold.

He did not even dare to put his hand on this place normally!

He was so angry!

Cen Shaoqing stretched out his hand. “Let me carry him.”

Lin Yang immediately hugged ye Zao tightly. “I don’t want you to carry me! I want to be carried by Aunt Fairy!”

Cen Shaoqing was dressed in black and had a cold expression on his face. It was obvious that he was not to be trifled with.

“Although Lin Yang was young, he had a good eye. ”

He knew who was to be trifled with and who was not to be trifled with. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“When Cen Shaoqing saw him like this, he became even angrier. If this little fellow was his son, he would have thrown him straight into the trash can! ”

Cen Shaoqing took out a beautifully wrapped candy from his pocket. “I have candy.”

“When he saw the Rainbow Candy Wrapper, Lin Yang’s eyes lit up. “Big Brother, Hug Me! I like you so much!” ”

Big Brother?

Cen Shaoqing furrowed his brows when he heard this form of address.

“If Lin Yang called Ye Zhuo Big Brother and called him Uncle, then wouldn’t he be in the same generation as him? Would he have to call ye Zhuo aunt instead? ”

That wouldn’t do!

“”Call me uncle,”Cen Shaoqing said as he stroked Lin Yang’s head. ”

“”You’re clearly Big Brother.”Lin Yang remembered his mother’s teachings. If he met a handsome uncle on the road, he had to call him Big Brother. ”

“”Uncle.”CEN Shaoqing continued, “Call me uncle and I’ll Hug You.” ”

“Of course, calling him Uncle sounded even better. ”

But Cen Shaoqing only dared to think about it in his heart.

Lin Yang immediately changed his words. “Uncle.”

Cen Shaoqing reached out and took Lin Yang.

Ye Zhuo followed behind.

“From behind, the scene looked a little warm. The three of them even looked like a family of three. ”

“After the Lin Brothers officially issued their obituaries, people came to pay their respects from time to time. ”

“The five brothers and wives of the Lin family stood at the main entrance of the manor, welcoming the crowd. ”

“The descendants of the Lin family wore mourning clothes and knelt in front of the mourning hall, looking a little majestic. ”

“After all, in this era, many people were only children. It was really rare to meet such a large family. ”

“Old Lady Lin’s funeral was especially grand, and there was an endless stream of people coming to pay their respects. ”

“Old Lady Cen stood in front of the mourning hall and looked at her old friend lying in the hotel. Her heart suddenly felt empty. Although she usually despised Old Lady Lin and even called her an old white lotus, now that Old Lady Lin had really left.., she was very sad. ”

This feeling was very strange.

“After all, Old Mrs. Lin and she were from the same era. ”

She still remembered Old Mrs. Lin’s appearance when she was young.

“At that time, she and old Mrs. Lin were good friends. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen stood in front of the mourning hall, with red eyes, she said, “It’s said that disasters last for a thousand years. Why did you leave first? “But it’s good that you left first. Remember to help me scout the way. You know me. I’m most afraid of the dark... ... But I don’t want to leave yet. Don’t come and scare me at night ... .. ”

She wanted to see Cen Shaoqing and ye Zao enter the Hall of marriage with her own eyes.

“Old Mrs. Cen rambled on and said a lot of things, then she said, “If you see Cen Lao er down there, you must help me ask him why he wants to be Chen Shimei! “Also, I want to divorce him! You tell him to get ready, and when I get there, immediately go through the divorce procedures!” ”
