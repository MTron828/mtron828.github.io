Translator: 549690339

“Ye Zao turned to look at Cen Shaoqing and asked in a low voice, “Are you sure this friend of yours wants to become a monk?” ”

Which Monk’s life could be richer than that of an old man?

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Yu Old Man walked over with a few girls. “Come, Linda, Paula, Yi Mei’er, fuduo, Xian’er, let me introduce you. This is CEN fifth master, and this is Miss Ye.” ”

“”Fifth Master Cen!”The girls were very enthusiastic, thinking that Yu Xiannian’s friends were the same as Yu Xiannian. They extended their hands towards Cen Shaoqing. “I’m Fuduo.” ”

Cen Shaoqing only nodded slightly and reached out to hold ye Zhuo’s shoulders. “This is my fiancée.”

“The smile on Fuduo’s face froze for a moment, but she was not embarrassed. She continued, “Fifth Master Cen’s fiancée is so beautiful!” ”

“”Thank you,”ye Zao said in a shallow tone. ”

“Fuduo continued, “Hello, Miss Ye. I’m Fuduo.” ”

“”Hello, Ye Zao,”ye Zao said concisely. ”

Ye Zao.

“When she heard this name, Fuduo was stunned. ”

Why did she feel that this name was a little familiar.

Ye Zao.

Could it be the famous miss ye from the science and Technology World.

“Fuduo’s brother was a scientist. As a scientist, he naturally talked about miss ye all the time. ”

It was said that Miss Ye was young and beautiful. Could this person be the rumored Miss Ye?

“As she thought of this, Fuduo’s expression changed. ”

“Linda, Xian ‘er, Paula, and the others also came over to greet ye Zao. ”

“Fuduo turned around and walked to Yu Sunset’s side, whispering a few words. ”

“”Let’s talk over there,”Yu sunset said. ”

Fu duo nodded and followed Yu Sunset’s footsteps.

“Coming to the side, Yu sunset put his hand on Fu duo’s shoulder and asked with a smile, “What did you find out?” ”

Fu duo looked in the direction of ye Zao. “I think you’d better not investigate Miss Ye. She’s different from what you imagined.”

“How is she different?”This sentence piqued Yu Sunset’s interest.

“Under normal circumstances, if a woman saw a woman more beautiful than herself, she would raise her guard. ”

But Fuduo did not.

“FUDUO continued, “It’s different in every way!” ”

Yu sunset laughed out loud.

Fuduo looked at Yu sunset. “I’m serious!”

“Fifth Master Cen was very powerful, but Miss Ye was not bad either. ”

“From Fuduo’s point of view, Cen Shaoqing and ye Zhuo were evenly matched existences. ”

“After saying that, FUDUO continued, “Do you know who Miss Ye Is?” ”

“Who?”Yu Mumu casually said.

“”Dr. YC,”fuduo said. ”

“Dr. YC?”Yu Mumu’s eyes couldn’t tell what kind of expression he had. He just looked at fuduo. “You mean ye Zao?”

Fuduo nodded. “That’s right!”

“Speaking up to this point, Fuduo’s memories became clearer. She remembered that she had watched a live broadcast about Dr. YC with her brother. ”

“Although a long time had passed, the combination of beauty and talent always left a deep impression on people. ”

“”Miss Ye is Dr. YC,”fuduo continued, “Fifth Master Cen is an unreachable person, but Miss Ye is not bad either!” ”

“Yu Luonian did not take Fuduo’s words to heart. He smiled and said, “You must have remembered wrongly.” ”

“I really didn’t remember wrongly!”

“”Alright, Alright, Alright! Alright, Alright, Alright! You Didn’t remember wrongly, I was wrong, Alright!”Yu sunset patted Fuduo’s shoulder. “We’ll act according to the plan later.” ”

Still Act according to the plan?

Fuduo was a little hesitant.Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Yu sunset continued, “Don’t worry, if anything happens, I’ll take care of it.” ”

Fuduo nodded in embarrassment.

Yu sunset was the man that she had a crush on for many years.

She remembered that she was only 16 years old when she first met him.

“At that time, he was already 26 years old. ”

The 26-year-old man was in high spirits and exuded the charm of a mature man everywhere.

“Even now, Fuduo was already 23 years old, but she still loved him deeply. ”

Even if he didn’t like her at all.

“Even if he only treated her as one of the thousands of women, she had no regrets. ”

“Although Fuduo had already promised Yu Luonian, she still secretly took a photo of ye Zao’s side profile. She planned to send it to her brother to confirm whether ye Zao was Dr. YC. ”

“Miss Fuduo.”

“Just as Fuduo was about to send the photo to her brother, a pleasant voice suddenly appeared above her head. ”

Fuduo shivered and looked up. It turned out that the person who spoke was none other than ye Zao.

“Miss Ye.”Fu duo quickly locked her phone screen and pulled out a smile.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Miss fu duo, I don’t really like taking photos, especially when my photos appear in someone else’s phone.” ”
