Chapter 463: 125: Trash will never be late. Everyone was dumbfounded. Ye Zao was Miracle Doctor Ye! 8

Translator: 549690339

Cen Yuyan waved her hand with a disgusted expression. “Throw it away! It’s just trash. It’s nothing valuable!”

“Okay.”The nanny sent the gift box to the garbage room.

“After Cen Yueya returned, the first thing she did was to open the gift that ye Zao had given her.”

“Even if it was a pile of feces, she felt that the thing that ye Zao had given her was fragrant!”

She had originally thought that the thing that ye Zao had prepared was a piece of handicraft.

“After all, the gift box was very light.”

“She did not expect that after opening the package, it would give Cen Yueya a huge shock!”

This was ZY technology’s latest air-conditioning clothes that could adjust the temperature!

This style had just been released.

It was limited to ten pieces worldwide!

“The selling price was needless to say, the most important thing was that they couldn’t get it!”

“Not to mention the limited number of 10 pieces, even the limited number of 500 pieces that Cen Yueya hired more than a dozen professional snatchers couldn’t get it.”

“Therefore, Cen Yueya usually wore ZY family’s normal selling price.”

She didn’t expect ye Zhuo to be a king bomb the moment he made his move!

Too Amazing!

Cen Yueya picked up the clothes and immediately went to the cloakroom to change.

It was indeed the work of the chief designer Z. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Whether it was the style or the lines, they were all designed perfectly. It was the kind that would definitely blow up the streets.”

Cen Yueya could not wait to wear this style of clothes and go for a walk.

It made those girls die of envy.

“However, her little sisters had gone on a trip abroad and had not returned yet.”

“Therefore, Cen Yueya put on the clothes and went downstairs for a walk. Her mother-in-law saw that she was wearing the limited edition of ZY and asked curiously, “Yaya, is this a replica of yours?””

“Because ZY’s limited edition was too hard to get, and because their family didn’t have a membership system, they couldn’t buy it even if they had money. Cen Yueya’s mother-in-law was also ZY’s fanatical fan.”

“”Fake? Mom, open your eyes wide and see if this is a fake!”Cen Yueya walked to her mother-in-law’s side.”

“It could be seen at a glance whether ZY’s clothes were fake or not. After all, the material was not the same as ordinary clothes.”

“There was another particularly obvious point. At the hem of each piece of clothing, there was a large z embroidered on it.”

“The mother-in-law said in surprise, “It’s really not a fake! How did you buy it? Can you think of a way to buy one for Mom?””

“Cen Yueya said with a proud face, “Of course it’s not a fake! Can someone as noble as your daughter-in-law wear a fake? “This is a gift from my sister-in-law!”! “You can’t buy it outside, but if you want it, Mom, I can help you ask my sister-in-law tonight.””

“”SO, master five really has a girlfriend?”The mother-in-law was even more surprised. “Moreover, the woman’s background is not small?””

A normal person could casually buy a limited edition of Zy?

“Cen Yueya nodded. “Of course! Otherwise, why would she be my sister-in-law!””

“After showing off the gift from her sister-in-law to her mother-in-law, Cen Yueya sent a wechat video to the other sisters.”

Cen Yuyan was the only one in the group who was not online.

“Cen Yuying and Cen Yueying’s packaging had already been opened. Their gifts were the same as Cen Yueying’s, both limited edition ZY.”

“However, the styles were different.”

Cen Yuying was steady.

Cen yueying was simple and generous.

“Cen Yueying’s was a Korean version, which had a gentleness to it.”

It had to be said that ye Zao’s taste in choosing clothes was really good.

“Where’s the fourth girl? Why Don’t I see the fourth girl? has the fourth girl opened the packaging and looked?”

“Cen yueying smiled and said, “The fourth girl is ZY’s fanatic fan! She must be so happy that she fainted.””

“After hanging up the video, Cen Yueya called Cen Yuyan again.”

“After calling twice, she finally picked up the phone. “Second sister, what’s the matter?””

“What are you doing? Why aren’t you picking up the phone?”

“Cen Yuyan’s gaze was fixed on the computer, afraid that she would miss the time. “ZY is releasing a limited edition new product today. I’m waiting for the time to place the order! Second sister, if you have nothing else to do, I’ll hang up First!””

“Cen Yueya: “Hang up what? Fourth Girl, you haven’t opened the present that Zao Zao gave you yet?””

Cen Yuyan frowned slightly.

Why was Cen Yueya asking about that street vendor all of a sudden?

Cen Yuyan didn’t want to mention that street vendor at all.

“But she couldn’t directly say that she had thrown it away, so she said, “I haven’t had the time to open it yet!””

“Cen yuaya continued, “Then what are you still standing there for? Go and open it and see! Let me tell you, what burning saw was a new product that was limited to 10 pieces worldwide! The designs of Big Sister, me, and the three girls are especially good-looking! Quickly take a look at what model burning saw for you?””

“At this moment, Cen Yuyan’s face turned pale. “Second sister, what did you say?””
