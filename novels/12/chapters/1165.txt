Ma Jia Yue frowned.

Why did this old woman suddenly ask this?

Could it be that she had discovered something?

It shouldn’t be!

She had clearly gone to the market with her last night...

“Ma Jia Yue continued, “Mom, didn’t I tell you! It was because sister-in-law Wang’s wife’s illness worsened that she resigned and went home!” ”

“Hearing that, Granny Zhou couldn’t contain her anger. She walked over and slapped Ma Jiayue’s face. ”

“”Ma Jiayue! It’s already so late, and you still don’t know how to repent!” ”

Ma Jiayue covered her face. “Mom! What are you doing!”

“What Am I doing? It should be what you want to do!”Granny Zhou pointed at Ma Jiayue. “Is my mother-in-law’s life so worthless in your eyes? Do You Wish For me to die as soon as possible so that you can give up your position!”

“All these years, she had always treated Ma Jiayue as her own daughter. She didn’t expect that Ma Jiayue would harm her so much! ”

“Even though she knew that ye Zao’s prescription was effective, she still kept it from her! ”

Not even a slap could relieve her anger. Granny Zhou waved her hand and gave Ma Jiayue another slap.

“”Mom! What are you doing!”Zhou Yisheng walked in from outside and said angrily, “How could you hit Jiayue!” ”

“Seeing Zhou Yisheng, Ma Jianyue immediately cried, “Yisheng!” ”

“It’s okay.”Zhou Yisheng Protected Ma Jianyue.

“Mother-in-law Zhou pointed at Ma Jianyue and said angrily, “Ask her. Ask your good wife what she has done!” ”

“Ma Jianyue covered her face and said aggrievedly, “What have I Done? What have I done to make you hit me like this! When I was at home, my parents never hit me like this!” ”

“Zhou Ye Sheng frowned. “Mom! No matter what Jia Yue did, it’s wrong to hit her! How can you do this!” ”

Zhou Ye Sheng was a cultured person and hated people who hit others.

“Granny Zhou took a deep breath, then she said, “Ye Sheng, let me ask you, how many years have I had diabetes? All these years, I can’t eat or drink. I really want to become a normal person, but what about Ma Jia Yue! Ask Ma Jia Yue what she did.” ”

“Hearing this, Ma Jia Yue’s heart skipped a beat. ”

Not good.

Could it be that the old woman knew something!

“Zhou Yesheng sighed. “Mom, I know that you’re sick and uncomfortable, but your illness wasn’t caused by Jia Yue. What’s the use of hitting her?” ”

“”If it wasn’t for her, I would have recovered long ago! All these years, I treated her like my own daughter, but what about her! She Can’t Wait for me to Die! How could our old Zhou family have such a vicious daughter-in-law...” ”

“At the end, Granny Zhou cried out bitterly. ”

Granny Zhou felt bad that her sincerity couldn’t be exchanged.

Zhou Yisheng frowned and turned to look at Ma Jianyue. “What’s going on?”

“Ma Jianyue felt a little guilty. “I, I don’t know either...” ”

“Granny Zhou said, “If she doesn’t say it, I’ll say it...” ”

“”You were afraid that there was something wrong with Miss Ye’s prescription, so I won’t blame you if you don’t let me take it! After all, you were truly thinking of me! But you knew that Auntie Wang’s lover had already recovered, yet you still dismissed her behind my back! Let me ask you, what kind of heart do you have? Do you wish for my early death?” ”

“If it wasn’t for Ma Jianyue, she wouldn’t have offended ye Zhuo so much today at the theater! ”

“The more Granny Zhou thought about it, the angrier she got. ” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“After hearing the whole story, Zhou Yisheng was also extremely angry. Ignoring the injury on Ma Jiayue’s face, he raised his hand and gave Ma Jiayue a slap. ”

“Ma Jiayue! You’ve gone too far!”

“Ma Jiayue was slapped to the ground, her face full of disbelief. ”

“They had been married for so many years, but Zhou Yisheng had never hit her. ”

This was the first time.

The Zhou family was in a mess because of this matter.

...

On the other side.

Shunxi Financial Group.

This year was the 50th anniversary of the Shunxi Financial Group.

“After the board meeting, everyone came to a consensus and decided to change the Shunxi Financial Group’s LOGO. ”

“Elder Feng, who was sitting on the right, said, “I think it’s most appropriate for you to design the logo for Our Financial Group.” ”

“It’s naturally the best if we can invite shallow drink. I just don’t know if shallow drink is willing to take the job.”

Not to mention taking the job.

They were afraid that it would be very difficult to even see shallow drink.

Who was shallow drink?

She was an internationally renowned designer.

Shallow drink was the one who designed country P’s national seal.

“If they could invite shallow drink to design the consortium’s LOGO for them, it would be a supreme honor! ”

“”President Ye, what do you think?”Elder Qian looked at Ye Zao. ”

“At first, everyone thought that ye Zao was too small to hold up the front. ”

A month passed.
