Translator: 549690339

“To the current Qiu Di, the eight great clans were just stepping stones. ”

“Once she ascended to the position of the female sovereign, there would be nothing left for the eight great clans to do? ”

She wanted to destroy ye Zhuo’s power bit by bit.

“Thinking of this, the corners of Qiu Di’s lips curled up. ”

Just wait.

“One day, she would personally break the prophecy and descend upon the world like a Phoenix, making the surname ‘Qiu’become the national surname of the state of Chang Yue. ”

“Seeing Qiu di’s confidence, Qiu Changzhen heaved a sigh of relief and said with a smile, “Alright, Di’er, since you know what to do, I won’t say anymore.” ”

“”Father, you don’t have to worry about these things,”Qiu di said. ”

“Then what about the password?”Qiu Changzhen continued to ask.

“If Qiu di did not know the password, then the rest of the road would not be easy. ”

“Qiu Di narrowed his eyes and continued, “Father, you don’t have to worry. Since they took the initiative to send over the information of the trans-star case, it means that they have already acknowledged me as their future Queen!” ”

Qiu Changzhen nodded. “Then I’ll go back first.”

“I’ll send you off.”Qiu Di followed Qiu Changzhen’s footsteps.

“When the two of them went out, it was still raining heavily outside. ”

Ye Han stood outside.

“Because he had been in the rain for a long time, his body was slightly trembling. ”

“No matter how good ye Han’s physical quality was, he could not withstand such damage. ”

“Seeing this scene, Qiu Changzhen turned around and looked at Qiu Di. “Di’er, is it really okay for Shangguan Jue to see how you treat him?” ”

Qiu Di’s treatment of Ye Han was understandable.

How did ye Han humiliate Qiu di back then?

He ignored Qiu Di.

“But now, Qiu Di still wanted to use ye Han. ”

“If Shangguan Jue saw this scene, he would definitely be suspicious. ”

“After all, Ye Han was ye Zhuo’s only younger brother in the Chang Yue Kingdom. ”

“Although they were not related by blood, the brotherly affection between them was no less than that between real siblings. ”

Qiu Di turned to look at Qiu Changzhen with a smile on his face. “Shangguan Jue has already met ye Han.”

“Met him?”Qiu Changzhen was very shocked.

“Yes.”Qiu Di nodded.

“Qiu Changzhen continued to ask, “Then did he suspect anything?” ” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Qiu di said, “If he suspected something, would he have given me the information on the trans-star case so readily?” ”

Qiu Changzhen nodded and once again sighed at Qiu Di’s brilliant methods.

“Sure enough, it was the Yangtze River’s later waves that pushed forward the previous waves, and the later waves that smashed the previous waves to death on the beach. ”

“Although he had been doing nothing all his life, his daughter was much more capable than him! ”

“Qiu Changzhen turned to look at Qiu Di. “Alright di’er, let’s end it here! You go back and busy yourself. I Won’t keep you any longer.” ”

“Okay.”Qiu di nodded and walked back.

Qiu Chang Zhen boarded the aircraft.

“Soon, the aircraft disappeared into the horizon. ”

“In the strong acid rain, Ye Han just stood there like a tall pine tree, neither servile nor overbearing. ”

“Two hours later, it was time for the shift change. ”

“Ye Han came to the changing room drenched in moisture, intending to change his clothes. ”

“Other than Ye Han, there was also a young guard captain who was changing his clothes in the changing room. ”

“The guard captain saw ye Han come over and smiled. “Old Wu, you’re Off Work?” ”

“En.”Ye Han nodded.

“The guard captain asked again, “Captain Wu, do you have a girlfriend? If you don’t, I can introduce you to someone.” ”

“”Thank you, there’s no need.”Ye Han directly rejected. ”

No need?

“The head guard smiled and said, “Which man doesn’t need a woman? Brother, don’t tell me you have someone in mind?” ”

Ye Han didn’t say anything.

“Knowing ye Han’s character, the head guard didn’t say anything more. When he walked to Ye Han’s side, he looked around to see that there was no one around, he lowered his voice and said, “Brother, do you think the eldest miss is deliberately targeting you! She always lets you stand in the strong acid rain? If this continues, even if your body is made of iron, it will be corroded.” ”

The guard captain really couldn’t hold it in anymore.

“He and ye Han shared the same changing room. Every time ye Han changed his clothes, he could clearly see the traces of corrosion on Ye Han’s body from the strong acid rain. ”

“Different from all living things in changyue, humans originated from Earth. Although they had lived in changyue for a long time, they were still unable to adapt to the strong acid rain. It didn’t matter if they were drenched occasionally, but if they were frequently like this.., their bodies would collapse sooner or later! ”

The Way Qiu di treated Ye Han was no different from deliberately making things difficult for him.

“However, Ye Han was still extremely loyal to Qiu Di. ”

“Hearing this, Ye Han frowned slightly. He took out the emei thorn hidden at his waist and pressed it against the guard’s neck. “Who told you to slander the eldest miss?” ”
