Elder Bai picked up his walking stick and knocked it hard on the ground. “Are you guys leaving or not? !”

“Dad!”Bai Jiacheng looked at elder Bai. “You’re also a parent. Can’t you understand our feelings?”

“Elder Bai’s face was stern. “If you don’t leave, Don’t blame me for not remembering the last bit of father-son relationship!” ”

“Seeing that old master Bai was about to make a big move, Bai Jiacheng had no choice but to leave with Zhou Ying. ”

“If he really provoked old master Bai, he would really do anything. ”

“Looking at the backs of Bai Jiacheng and Zhou Ying, Old Master Bai Sighed helplessly. ”

“Right now, Bai Jiacheng and Zhou Ying were still a little afraid of him, but how long could he live? ”

“Once he left, Bai Jiacheng and Zhou Ying would definitely go look for Bai Jingshu! ”

It seemed that some things could be prepared early.

“Thinking of this, elder Bai narrowed his eyes. He absolutely couldn’t let Bai Jiacheng and Zhou Ying Drag Bai Jingshu down! ”

On the other side.

“Because the return trip from Galaxy S to Earth would take three days, this wedding would only be held in Galaxy S. ”

“After three days, Lin Ze and Bai Jingshu would return to Earth and have a new wedding. ”

“After all, Lin Ze and Bai Jingshu had family and friends on Earth. ”

“However, because Old Mrs. Shangguan had just announced Lin Ze’s identity as the heir, the wedding would be held at the Shangguan family home. ”

Old Mrs. Shangguan made preparations in advance and specially brought Lin Jincheng and Ye Shu over.

Lin Ze was also a little surprised to see Lin Jincheng and ye Shu at the Shangguan residence. “Mom and Dad! When did you arrive?”

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “We arrived a long time ago, but your Grandma Shangguan said that she wanted to give you a surprise, so she hasn’t said anything.” ”

“Almost all the relatives of the Shangguan family had come, as well as all the bigwigs from the F galaxy. ”

The scene was very lively.

“First of all, everyone was curious about what the successor that Old Lady Shangguan had chosen looked like. ”

“Second, everyone wanted to see what was so different about this Lin Ze. He was just an earthling, yet he could make Old Lady Shangguan look at him in such a different light. ”

“However, when everyone saw Lin ze leading the bride out, they discussed animatedly and questioned Old Lady Shangguan’s taste. ”

There were many reasons.

“Lin Ze was too young. Other than being handsome, there seemed to be nothing special about him. ”

“”This time, old lady has made a mistake. There are so many young and promising candidates in the family, but she chose this one instead!” ”

“Aren’t those stewards of the Shangguan family going to come out and say a word?”

“”Old lady has her eyes on him, so what’s the point of the stewards coming out and saying anything? No matter how powerful they are, how can they be more powerful than Old Lady?” ”

“Did you notice that this Lin Ze looks a little like Shangguan Yue?”

Shangguan Yue was the grandson of the old lady.

“Hearing this, the crowd instantly exploded. Everyone stared at Lin Ze’s face, as if they wanted to see a flower on his face. ”

“”Don’t say it, Lin Ze really looks a little like Shangguan Yue! Sigh, what’s the use of us working hard? In the end, we still can’t compare to a bag of skin!” ”

It was needless to say what made Lin ze the heir of Shangguan!

“In the crowd, a young man who looked about the same age as Lin Ze narrowed his eyes. ”

“He had thought that Lin Ze was a powerful person, but it turned out that he was just so-so! ”

Just wait and see.

“If Old Lady Shangguan could help Lin ze up with one hand, she could personally pull Lin ze down from his high position. ”

“Although Old Mrs. Shangguan was already old, she was not muddle-headed. ”

“If Lin Ze did not do anything after he took over, old Mrs. Shangguan would definitely help him. ”

“At that time, old Mrs. Shangguan would naturally see his good side. ”

“Lin Ze’s appearance was not a bad thing for him, but a good thing. ”

“After all, only the inferior could bring out the superior. ”

It was precisely because of the existence of a person like Lin Ze that Old Lady Lin was able to discover his excellence.

He was now looking forward to Lin Ze taking over the Shangguan family’s matters in the future.

“A moment later, the man turned around and left with a faint smile on his face. ”

“Just as he walked out of the door, he was stopped by a young woman. “Brother Jun. .” ”

Shangguan Jun stopped in his tracks and turned around. “Lianxin.”

“Zhao lianxin walked over and carefully chose his words, then he said, “Brother Jun, don’t be too sad. Although the position of the successor has been given to someone else by the matriarch, in my heart, you are still the most powerful one. No one can compare to you!”Shangguan Jun was an orphan that Old Lady Shangguan had picked up on the battlefield, he had been raised beside Old Lady Shangguan since he was a child. ”

“He was very outstanding, and because of this, the outside world had been speculating that Shangguan Jun was the heir to the Shangguan family. ”

Who would have thought that Lin Ze would suddenly appear from behind.

“Hearing this, Shangguan jun smiled and said, “Sister Lianxin, what are you saying? I’m not sad at all.”He was actually quite happy, happy that Old Lady Shangguan was finally going to discover his value. ”

“Ah?”Zhao Lianxin was stunned.

“Shangguan Jun patted Zhao Lianxin’s head and said, “What a silly girl! Let’s go and eat something delicious!” ”

“When it came to happy things, of course they had to celebrate. ”

“Zhao Lianxin was a little puzzled. “Brother Jun, what’s wrong with you?”He was clearly frowning in the morning, worried that Lin Ze would come over and target him. He was worried that there would be some internal strife. That was how it was in the afternoon! Was he pretending to be strong? ”

“Shangguan jun smiled and said, “Nothing, I’m just happy. Let’s Go!” ”

“After saying that, Shangguan Jun directly put his arm around Zhao Lianxin’s shoulder and the two of them strode out. ”
