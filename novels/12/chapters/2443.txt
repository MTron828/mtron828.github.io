The fast curve ahead didn’t slow down!

“Not only did it not slow down, it even showed signs of accelerating. ”

This was a little scary.

“Slow down quickly!”Yu Xiannian suddenly said.

“If it didn’t slow down, Xian ‘er’s car would definitely crash into it. ”

“At that time, the car would be destroyed and people would die. ”

“”It’s too late,”Xian ‘er said with a pale face. ”

How could she have known that a car would suddenly appear!

What should she do now.

“Just as the car was about to crash into it, the car in front made a beautiful big turn and drifted past. ”

Beautiful!

It was really too beautiful! CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Even a professional racing driver would not be able to make such a fatal turn.

Yu Niannian looked at the car that disappeared in front of her with a puzzled look in her eyes.

Whose car was that?

“Xian ‘er was also a little confused. She knew almost all the great gods in the racing circle, but she had never heard of any great gods coming to the South Sea. ”

The scene just now really scared her.

She almost thought that she was going to die here today.

“At that moment, Xian ‘er even thought of a suicide note. ”

“”Young Master Yu, whose car was that just now?”Xian ‘er asked. ”

Yu Mumu shook his head. “I’m not sure.”

He was also very curious. who was that just now?

“At that moment, Xian ‘er seemed to have thought of something and said in surprise, “Could that be Miss Ye’s car?” ”

Miss Ye?

Ye Zhuo?

Impossible!

Yu Mumu was also an expert in racing cars. He knew how many years of skill it would take to drive a car like that.

“If he was not a big shot in the racing industry, he would not be able to do such a thing. Damn ”

How Old Was Ye Zhuo?

She was only in her early twenties.

How could her driving skills be so good!

“Even if he used his toes to think, he knew that it was definitely not ye Zhuo. ”

“Thinking of this, Yu sunset chuckled. “Impossible!” ”

“Is it really not?”Xian ‘er asked.

“”Absolutely not,”yu sunset answered with certainty. ”

“Xian ‘er narrowed her eyes and continued, “But I remember that Miss ye drives a jeep.” ”

Could it be that she remembered wrongly?

“Yu Mumu smiled and said, “Could it be that there’s only one jeep in the entire country?” ”

“If the one driving the Jeep was ye Zao, then how many ye Zao were there in the entire country. ”

It had to be said that Yu Mumu’s words were quite reasonable.

“Xian ‘er smiled and said, “Let’s not talk about other things. Miss ye is really beautiful. I’ve never seen a girl who’s more beautiful than Miss Ye.”Xian ‘er was born into a wealthy family, all the places she went to were high-end and luxurious. What kind of beauty had she not seen before? ”

“However, it was her first time seeing someone as beautiful as ye Zao. ”

“Most importantly, not only was ye Zao good-looking, his figure and temperament were also top-notch! ”

She had never seen a girl as beautiful as ye Zao.

“As a girl, she appreciated beauties more than boys. ”

Yu Xiannian looked ahead. “It’s just skin.”

“A good-looking skin was like a thousand laws, and an interesting soul was one in ten thousand. ”

“To the old man, no matter how good-looking a girl was, she was no different in his eyes. ”

She was a woman.

Wasn’t she just like that.

Scheming and unscrupulous for her purpose.

Ye Zao was the same to the old man.

It was unknown why CEN Shaoqing was so infatuated with ye Zao.

“Xian ‘er knew Yu Xiannian’s personality and continued, “What if Miss Ye is different? Young Master Yu, your prejudice against girls is too deep!” ”

Yu Xiannian did not say anything.

“Xian ‘er knew that Yu Xiannian did not like such topics and continued, “Miss Ye doesn’t seem to be here yet. Should we wait for her?” ”

“There’s no need to wait.”

“Although ye Zao was Cen Shaoqing’s girlfriend, Yu Xiannian did not intend to give face to ye Zao. ”

A beauty was a disaster.

Cen Shaoqing hated girls who cried the most. He wanted to see how ye Zhuo would react when the time came.

“”Young master Yu,”Xian ‘er continued to speak. ”

“What’s Wrong?”Yu sunset years asked.

“Xian ‘er continued, “Under normal circumstances, only love rivals would do this. Young Master Yu, are you...” ”

“Otherwise, why would yu sunset years go through all this trouble? ”

He was always targeting ye Zhuo!

The only explanation was...

Yu Mumu laughed out loud and turned to look at Xian ‘er. “Doubting my sexual orientation?”

Xian ‘er did not say anything.

Silence meant acquiescence.

“Yu Mumu continued, “Is my performance in bed not enough to prove my sexual orientation?” ”

Xian ‘ER’s face instantly turned red. “Young Master Yu!”

Yu Mumu laughed out loud. “Speed Up!”

“Okay.”

Xian ‘er immediately sped up.

200 yards!

“The journey, which was supposed to take an hour, only took about 20 minutes under Xian ‘er’s acceleration. ”
