“Ye Sen instructed ye Zao, “Zao Zao, take the exam well. Don’t be nervous if you encounter questions that you don’t know how to do. At most, we can do it again next year!” ”

Ye Shu nodded. “Your uncle is right. Don’t put too much pressure on yourself. There are plenty of repeaters these days.”

“”Mom, uncle, don’t worry. I will definitely take the exam seriously and not let you guys down.”Ye Zao continued, “Then I will go in first. Don’t Wait for me outside. Go back to work!” ”

“”Yes, we know. Go in quickly. When you go in, we’ll go back to work,”ye Shu said. ”

Ye Sen nodded. “Go in quickly.”

Ye Zhuo turned around and walked to the school gate.

Ye Sen and ye Shu stood at the gate and watched her back.

“At the same time, a slender figure stood among the group of parents who were watching the exam. Even though he tried hard to hide himself, he still stood out from the crowd. ”

“He wore an exquisite handmade suit and a pair of wide sunglasses on his high nose bridge, covering his good-looking eyes. All that was left was a thin chin and a beautiful curve of his lips. ”

A moment later.

He tore off a big white rabbit milk candy and put it into his mouth.

Little did he know.

A man who was parked in a black car across the road had been paying attention to this side for a long time.

“The man was wearing a long robe with knotted buttons. He slowly lowered the car window, and his hand that was holding the prayer beads was inadvertently placed on the car window. He looked over and slightly narrowed his eyes. His deep eyes could not see the end of the road. ”

It was him again.

The man who sent ye Zhuo to the party that night.

Who was he?

“Inexplicably, Cen Shaoqing felt some hostility toward this unknown man. ”

“A moment later, he picked up his phone and sent a message. [ check a person for me. ] ”

“Ye Zhuo walked all the way to the Examination Hall. Unlike the nervous students, her face was always calm and indifferent. In addition, she was good-looking and had a good figure. Along the way, she had received countless attention. ”

“DAMN! This is too good-looking!”

“I think I know her!”

“Bullsh * T!”

“I’m serious! She’s the school belle of North Bridge High School Class 7! She’s very famous in North Bridge!”

“No wonder she’s so beautiful. So she’s the school Belle...”

“Not long after, Ye Zao found the exam hall. ”

There were two teachers guarding the front and back doors.

“When entering the exam hall, not only did they have to search her body, but they also had to scan her with a metal detector. ”

“The one in the front row was a bespectacled boy. When the detector scanned him, it kept ringing on his back. The invigilator said with a strange expression, “Are you wearing something inside? Why does your back keep ringing?” ”

“Under normal circumstances, only a girl’s back would make a sound. ”

A big boy actually made a sound...

This was a little unbelievable.

“When he said this, not only did the others look over, even the bespectacled boy’s face turned red. “I, I’m not wearing anything...” ”

“At this moment, a few girls standing beside the boy silently took a few steps back. ”

The metal detector that was ringing non-stop instantly stopped.

Only then did the invigilator understand what was going on. “Go in.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The boy quickly walked inside.

“As Ye Zao had long been prepared, she changed into pure cotton underwear, so when the metal detector swept over, it did not make a sound. ”

She smoothly entered the examination room.

“She sat by the window. As long as she tilted her head slightly, she could see the lush summer color outside the window. ”

A boy wearing a white shirt noticed her the moment ye Zhuo entered the room. His line of sight had been looking in ye Zhuo’s direction.

He had never seen such a good-looking girl in all his years of study.

“Soon, it was nine o’clock. ”

The invigilator explained some of the rules of the examination room and handed out the papers.

The first exam was Chinese.

“After ye Zhuo received the papers, she started to write her composition. ”

Then she started to write from the first paper.

“Her writing speed was very fast, as if she did not need to think, but her handwriting was very good. ”

“At 10:30, Ye Zhuo finished the papers. Because she could not leave the examination room easily even if she handed in the papers early, ye Zhuo carefully checked the papers twice and then laid on the table to sleep. ”

Everyone in the examination venue was writing furiously. Ye Zhuo was the only one who was sleeping. The invigilators were all looking at her.

“They had been teachers for so many years, but this was the first time they had seen her sleeping in the examination venue of the college entrance examination. How bad was her result? ”

“As long as she had a slight result, she would not have fallen asleep in the examination venue. ”

“The other examinees felt that they did not have enough time, but she actually fell asleep. ”

This child was really unteachable!

“Very soon, it was time to hand in the papers. ”

“When the bell rang, everyone stopped writing, and the invigilator personally collected the papers. ”

“When he received ye Zhuo’s papers, the invigilator took a special look at them. ”

“If he did not look at them, he would not know, but when he saw them, he was shocked. ”

The invigilator originally thought that ye Zhuo was a piece of scrap metal.

He did not think that she was actually a king.

Not to mention the content of the examination paper.

Just this beautiful handwriting alone was enough to make people gasp in amazement.

No wonder he would sleep in the examination room. It turned out that he had sufficient strength.

After handing in the examination paper.

Ye Zhuo left the examination room.

“At this moment, a male student ran over. “This student.” ”

“You’re calling for me?”Ye Zhuo looked back slightly.

“Facing Ye Zhuo, the male student’s face flushed red. Then, he nodded. “Yes.” ”

“What’s the matter?”Ye Zhuo continued to ask.

“The boy continued, “My surname is Yang Yue. I was in the same exam room as you just now. I was in the middle group and you were in the first group. Can you make friends? Which High School are you from?” ”

“”I’m from North Bridge High School,”ye Zhuo replied. ”

“”I’m from No. 12 High School, right next to your school.”Yang Yue continued, “Being in the same exam room is fate. Why don’t we add each other on wechat?” ”
