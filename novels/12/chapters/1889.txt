“The assistant’s voice came from the other side, “Captain Wu, Miss wants you to go over immediately.” ”

“”Okay, ask miss to wait for a moment.”After hanging up the communication device, Ye Han immediately prepared to set off. ”

Even if he hadn’t eaten a drop of water at his current position.

“No matter what happened, it was not as important as autumn flute’s matter. ”

“To Ye Han, the autumn flute was the most important person in his life. ”

That feeling was like a person in his mind constantly reminding her that she had to obey the autumn flute’s orders unconditionally.

“In short, that feeling was very strange. ”

“Ye Han didn’t think too much about it. After leaving his residence, he boarded the aircraft and hurried over to the autumn flute. ”

...

“On the other side, on the great prairie. ”

“Cen Shaoqing and ye Zao sat on the sleigh, pulled by seven or eight Huskies, and leisurely galloped on the great prairie. ”

“In winter, the great prairie was filled with a vast expanse of whiteness. The snowy sky was the same color. Looking from afar, it was very spectacular! ”

“Occasionally, a few silly roe deers would gallop across the snowy ground. ”

“There were also a few brave silly roe deers that even chased after the sleigh. They stared at Cen Shaoqing and ye Zao with their big watery eyes and tilted their cute heads. They sized up Cen Shaoqing and ye Zao sitting on the sleigh, their eyes filled with curiosity. ”

“Ye Zao turned around and looked at those foolish roe deers. He smiled and said, “Look at these foolish Roe Deers! Fortunately, they are protected animals. Otherwise, they would have been extinct by now.” ”

Cen Shaoqing held ye Zao’s hand and opened his thin lips. “Did you learn a text when you were young?”

“What text?”Ye Zao asked.

“CEN Shaoqing said, “Beating roe deers and ladling fish.” ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “I learned it, but I didn’t understand it at that time.” ”

“At that time, she was still wondering how many gowns and fish there were before she could beat them with sticks and scoop them up with a ladle? The author must have been more or less virtual. ”

“Now, it seemed that the author didn’t use virtual techniques or exaggerated techniques. ”

“Now, even silly roe deers dared to chase people like this. Many years ago, silly roe deers must have been even dumber. ”

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “A creature like the robe relies on its intelligence to turn itself into a protected animal.”When hunters carry guns, ah, when hunting, normal small animals would run away, but not only would the silly roe deer not run, instead, you have to stop and join the fun. ”

“Because, silly roe deer less and less, and finally reduced to a protected animal. ”

“Ye Zhuo then said:”then ladle fish said

“You’ll know when I take you to a place.”Cen Shaoqing controlled the direction and drove the sleigh in another direction.

“Soon, the two of them arrived at a natural lake. ”

“Although the grassland was covered with a thick layer of snow, the surface of the lake was sparkling and did not freeze. ”

“Different from streams or pools, the lake water on the grassland was made of blue tiles. It was especially beautiful, especially when it was set off by the surrounding white snow! ”

“Give me your hand.”Cen Shaoqing got out of the car first and handed his hand to ye Zao. Ye Zao put his hand on his palm.

The two of them got out of the sleigh together and came to the lakeside.

“Looking at it, Ye Zao was surprised to find that the lakeside was full of herring. ”

“Instantly, ye Zao seemed to see pickled fish, boiled fish, and braised fish waving at him. ”

“Moreover, if this kind of cold fish was made into pickled fish, it would have a different flavor. ”

It would definitely be super delicious.

“Thinking of the delicious fish meat, ye Zao could not help but swallow his throat. ”

“Seeing her like this, Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips curled up into a faint arc. “Leader, dispel your thoughts as soon as possible?” ”

“Do you know what I have in mind?”Ye Zao asked.

“CEN shaoqing said, “Sauerkraut fish, boiled fish, braised fish, steamed fish, yes or no?” ” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“”Yes.”Ye Zhuo rolled up his sleeves. “Since you know what I have in mind, what are you waiting for? Hurry up and do it!” ”

“There were so many delicious fish. If he missed it, he would never have the chance again. ”

“You can’t eat the fish here.”Cen Shaoqing looked back calmly.

Ye Zhuo frowned slightly. “Why?”

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Do you know about water burials?” ”

Water burials?

“After being stunned for a moment, ye Zhuo finally reacted. He pointed at the fish by the lake and said in disbelief, “You mean, these fish are all...”the rest of his words were self-evident. ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded lightly. “Yes.”

“How could this be?”Ye Zhuo frowned slightly.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Because of this, very few people on the grassland eat fish.”Not only did they not eat fish, but fish was also a sacred object to them. ”
