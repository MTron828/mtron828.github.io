“Feng Qianhua sighed when she said the last sentence. It seemed like she was explaining for Ye Shu, but in fact, she was belittling ye Shu. ”

“Old Mrs. Lin was very glad that Lin Ze had grown up by her side. If Lin Ze had grown up by Ye Shu’s side, he would have been crippled long ago! ”

Dragons give birth to dragons and phoenixes give birth to phoenixes. The son of a mouse could dig holes.

How could a woman like ye Shu teach a child well?

Even the best child would be raised askew by her!

“However, although Lin Ze had grown up by her side, Lin Ze still sided with Ye Shu and did not put her in his eyes at all. ”

He did not even think about who had raised him and who had raised him to be a talent!

Did all of this have anything to do with ye Shu?

She had no conscience!

She had no conscience at all!

“Thinking of this, Old Madam Lin felt that Lin Ze was inferior to Feng Xianxian. ”

“She hadn’t raised Feng Xianxian for a day, but Feng Xianxian still treated her like her own grandmother. Her own grandson, whom she had raised with her own hands, had fallen out with her. He had gone to acknowledge a woman who hadn’t raised him for a day and still had to acknowledge her as his mother. ” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Wasn’t that sarcasm?

Old Lady Lin was both angry and angry.

“Feng Qianhua continued, “Aunt Lin, don’t think too much. That child is only nineteen this year. As long as you raise her properly now and discipline her a little more, there will still be a chance for her to become successful.” ”

“After saying that, Feng Qianhua continued, “She’s still a girl after all. If it really doesn’t work out, she can just marry off as soon as possible.” ”

“If she were to marry off her daughter, would it have anything to do with the Lin family at that time? ”

Want to sit firmly in the position of the Lin family’s eldest daughter?

Sit In her big dreams!

“She’s just a piece of trash. When that time comes, it would still be up to them to decide! ”

“Hearing this, Old Madam Lin’s eyes lit up. ”

It had to be said that Feng Qianhua’s words had hit the nail on the head.

That’s right.

“At worst, she could just find a random family to marry off to. At this moment, Old Madam Lin was already thinking of a suitable family. ”

“Old Madam Lin held Feng Qianhua’s hand tightly. “Qianhua, don’t worry! In My Heart, you’ve always been my daughter-in-law! You’ve waited for Jin city for nineteen years. I’ll definitely make Jin City give you an explanation.” ”

“In this family, only Feng Qianhua and her mother were still on the same side as her. Therefore, she would definitely make Feng Qianhua become the daughter-in-law of the Lin family. ”

“Feng Qianhua smiled and said, “I am already very happy to see Jin city happy. Aunt Lin, I don’t need any explanation. “Although my engagement with Jin city has been canceled, you have always been my mother in my heart. No matter what, I will always treat you as my biological mother.” ”

“After hearing this, Old Mrs. Lin was very touched and her eyes were red. ”

Feng Qianhua was such a filial person.

Why couldn’t Lin Jin city see how good Feng Qianhua was?

Why couldn’t a good woman meet a good man?

How could a person like ye Shu be worthy of Lin Jin City?

“After chatting with old Mrs. Lin for a while, Feng Qianhua proposed to leave. Old Mrs. Cen asked Auntie Zhang to send Feng Qianhua off. ”

“Aunt Zhang sent Feng Qianhua off. As soon as she walked out of the door, the smile on her face disappeared. “Qianhua, what do you plan to do next?” ”

It was already dark outside. The darkness covered the viciousness in Feng Qianhua’s eyes. Her gaze landed not far away. “Let’s wait and see.”

Ye Zhuo was a good-for-nothing. Ye Shu had not even graduated from junior high school. How could these two people be qualified to be the eldest daughter of the Lin Family? How could they be qualified to be the mistress of the Lin Family?

Ye Shu could not defeat her nineteen years ago.

“Nineteen years later, she still lost to her! ”

“Aunt Zhang narrowed her eyes. “Fortunately, we held back back back then. Otherwise, we wouldn’t have been able to deal with the mother and daughter when they came back.”After all, dealing with an idiot was much easier than dealing with a normal person. ”

“”I have to thank you for that. If it weren’t for you, I might not have thought so much.”Feng Qianhua looked at Aunt Zhang gratefully. ”

“Aunt Zhang smiled and said, “Experience is all summed up. You Were Young at that time, so it’s normal that you didn’t think it through thoroughly. As long as you didn’t leave yourself with any regrets, it’s fine.” ”

“Feng Qianhua sighed. “It’s a pity that I didn’t pay attention to this matter at that time. If I had known earlier, I would have completely turned that bastard into an idiot.” ”

“”A man’s heart is not enough.”Aunt Zhang patted Feng Qianhua’s hand. “As long as you know that the Little Bastard is an idiot, you’ll be fine.” ”

What was the difference between a good-for-nothing and an idiot?

Feng Qianhua nodded.

“Aunt Zhang continued, “During this period of time, you should rest well at home. Don’t think too much. The old lady has me here. You Don’t have to worry.” ”
