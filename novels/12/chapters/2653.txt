“Chapter 2654: 573: New Life, New Start 3”

Translator: 549690339

This was very unlike Li Hang.

“An Lizi frowned slightly, feeling a little puzzled. ”

“”Lizi,”Li Hang took the initiative to greet her. ”

An Lizi walked over. “Why are you so early?”

“Li hang said, “I just happened to have nothing to do, so I came over early.” ”

An Lizi sat opposite Li Hang.

“Li Hang handed the menu to an Lizi. “Lizi, what would you like to drink?” ”

“”Coconut milk latte,”an Lizi said. ”

“Okay.”Li hang nodded and turned to call the waiter. “A coconut milk latte.”

“The two of them sat opposite each other, speechless for a moment. ”

“Fortunately, the waiter who delivered the food quickly broke the silence. ”

“”Hello, your coconut milk latte.” ”

“Just as he put down the cup, a strong coconut milk smell and the aroma of the latte spread over. ”

“An Lizi took a sip of coffee and said, “You didn’t just come to me for coffee, right?” ”

“”Yes.”Li hang nodded. “Lizi, my mom left.” ”

“Where did she go?”An Lizi was stunned for a moment.

It was also a little strange. Why did Li Hang tell her about Zhou Cuihua’s whereabouts for no reason.

“Li Hang was silent for a moment and then said, “She left a week ago. The first seven days have already passed.” ”

The first seven days?

“Hearing this, an Lizi instantly reacted and continued, “What do you mean?” ”

“Yes.”Li hang nodded. “It’s exactly what you think.”

“Speaking up to this point, Li hang continued, “People often say that good will be rewarded with good, and evil will be rewarded with evil. Perhaps, this is our retribution.” ”

“In the past, Li Hang did not believe this sentence. That was why she was willing to do anything to achieve her goal. ”

“But now, Li Hang firmly believed these words. ”

The fact that she and her mother had come this far was all retribution.

“Li Hang took a sip of his coffee, but his eyes couldn’t tell what kind of expression he had. “So, people should do more good deeds.” ”

“But doing good deeds, Mo Wen’s future. ”

An Lizi was stunned and didn’t know how to respond for a moment.

“She originally thought that Li Hang was looking for her for something else, but now the development of the matter had already deviated from her understanding. ”

“Li hang continued, “Lizi, I came here today to replace my deceased mother and apologize to you and your aunt. I don’t have the face to see her anymore. Please help me convey that no one will disturb her life in the future.” ”

Li Hang Thought for a long time and finally decided to personally apologize to an Lizi.

“Before Zhou Cuihua was cremated, Li Hang also changed her into another shroud. ”

“Although she was an atheist, this would at least make her conscience feel better. ”

“An Lizi looked at li hang and continued, “Actually, you came to find me today completely out of my expectations. Since she’s already gone, there’s no need to dwell on the past. I hope you can be happy in the future.” ”

No one would argue with a person who had already passed away. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

And no one would continue to bite the bullet.

“Forgetting the past could make one happier, and it could also make others happier. ”

“”Thank you,”Li Hang said. ”

“In fact, Li Hang did not expect an Lizi to say anything to wish her happiness. In the past, she had been blinded by jealousy and missed out on a good sister. In the future, she did not expect to have a sisterly relationship with an Lizi. It was fine as long as both of them were well. ”

“Li Hang picked up the cup in front of him and continued, “This cup is to our past.” ”

“After saying that, she took a sip of coffee. ”

“After drinking, she raised the cup again. “This cup is to our tomorrow.” ”

Everything was in the cup of coffee that had already been drunk.

An Lizi also picked up the cup and drank with her.

“When she left, an Lizi said, “Where do you live now? Shall I send you back?” ”

“”There’s no need. I’ll just take the bus.”Li hang raised his hand. “Goodbye, Lizi.” ”

“Some people might still be in the same city after that, but they might never see each other again. ”

People had to pay for their actions.

“Goodbye.”

Li hang smiled. “You have to be happy forever.”

“”You too,”an Lizi said. ”

“After saying that, Li Hang walked onto the bus that was parked in front of him. ”

“Looking at the bus that was gradually moving away, an lizi was filled with emotions. After a moment, she turned around to drive. ”

“After returning home, an Lizi told Xia Xiaoman about what had happened today. ”

“Hearing that, Xia Xiaoman was also very surprised. “Are you saying that your aunt is gone?” ”

“Yes.”An Lizi nodded.

Xia Xiaoman sighed. “Life is really like a dream.”

An Lizi looked around the house. “Where’s Ah Zhi?”

“Your dad took him out to play.”

“As soon as she said this, Xiao Lin Zhi’s voice came from outside the door. “Big Sister, Big Sister! I’m Back!” ”

“Ah Zhi.”

“Xiao Lin Zhi was holding two piglets of Paige’s ice cream in his hands. He ran towards an Lizi. “Big sister, this is the ice cream that dad bought. We’ll each have one.” ”

“Thank you.”

An Lizi reached out to take the ice-cream.

Xia Xiaoman looked at Lin Qingxuan behind her and smiled. “Lizi is already a child. Why are you still buying ice-cream for her?”

“”Look at what you’re saying. No matter how old a child is, he’s still a child,”Lin Qingxuan said. ”

“An Lizi held the ice-cream in her hands. Her heart was warm as she smiled and said, “That’s right. Can’t I just enjoy eating ice-cream?” ”

“In fact, what she cared about was not the ice cream, but her attitude. Although buying ice cream was not a big deal, it proved her position in Lin Qingxuan’s heart. ”
