“When she walked to Ye Sen’s side, Bai Wei realized that something had changed about him. ”

“Normally, when he saw her, his face would be full of smiles, and his eyes would be filled with her. ”

“But today, he did not. ”

“Not only did he not smile, but he was very serious. ”

“Ye Sen looked at Bai Wei. “I wanted to call you, but then I thought about it. It’s better to talk about this in person.” ”

What was better to talk about in person?

Could it be a proposal?

“With Ye Sen’s personality, it was not impossible. ”

“Thinking of this, Bai Wei was very excited. ”

“Bai Wei could not hide the surprise on her face. She lowered her head and said, “What do you have to say in person? Then I’m here now. You can say it.” ”

“”Let’s break up,”Ye Sen continued. ”

“What?”Bai Wei looked at Ye Sen with disbelief in her eyes. She almost thought that she was hearing things.

Ye Sen repeated it again.

“Don’t tell me your sister and your niece don’t like me?”Bai Wei asked.

“Ye Sen looked at Bai Wei. “Stop pretending, Li Lanxiang. I know everything.” ”

“When the words “Li Lanxiang”came out of Ye Sen’s mouth, Bai Wei’s legs went weak and her mind went blank. ” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

How did he know?

How did ye Sen Know?

“”Ye Sen, listen to me. Things aren’t what you think!”Bai Wei grabbed ye Sen’s hand and cried, “I didn’t mean to lie to you! I’m telling you everything! I’ll tell you everything! Please don’t break up with Me, okay? I love you, I really love you!” ”

She still wanted to become a rich lady!

She couldn’t Lose Ye Sen.

No!

Ye Sen calmly pushed Bai Wei’s hand away. “Leave some dignity for yourself.”

“After saying that, Ye Sen turned around and got into the car. ”

Bai Wei collapsed on the ground and cried loudly.

How did she get discovered?

What exactly did she give herself away?

What exactly was going on?

“Just then, the car door closed and suddenly opened at this time. ”

Could it be that ye Sen couldn’t bear to part with her?

Bai Wei raised her head in surprise.

“Just then, a makeup mirror and a lipstick were mercilessly thrown on the ground. ”

These two items were specially placed by Bai Wei on Ye Sen’s passenger seat.

Her original intention was to make those girls who tried to get on Ye Sen’s passenger seat retreat.

“But now, even these items were thrown out. ”

“Before Bai Wei could react, the engine of the car sounded, and the next second, the black Mercedes drove away. ”

“Ye Sen!”

Bai Wei immediately chased after him.

But all she was left with was dust on the ground.

“Bai Wei was unwilling to give up. She called Ye Sen, but he was busy. ”

“Then, she opened wechat, but she couldn’t send any messages. ”

He blocked her!

“When Bai Wei returned to the rental house, Li Yiyi saw Bai Wei like this and her heart skipped a beat. “What happened to you?” ”

“Bai Wei roared, “Ye Sen broke up with me! He knows! He knows everything!” ”

“How could this be?”Li Yiyi said in disbelief.

“Bai Wei pointed at Li Yiyi and said, “Was it you! Was it you who told the secret!” ”

“Am I crazy? I’m going to tell the Secret!”

“”It’s You! It’s you, B * Tch! You Can’t stand seeing me and Ye Sen together! You’re jealous of me!”Bai Wei had already lost her mind and slapped Li Yiyi directly. ”

“Thinking about it carefully, other than Li Yiyi, there was no one else who could tell the secret. ”

Thinking about it!

“Bai Wei vented all her anger on Li Yiyi, wishing she could tear off all of Li Yiyi’s hair. ”

Li Yiyi was not someone to be trifled with. The two women immediately began to fight.

...

It was different from last time.

Ye Sen did not go to get drunk. He went straight to the company and began to handle official business.

He acted as if nothing had happened.

“However, a discerning person could tell at a glance that ye Sen had changed a lot. ”

“In the past, he would smile wherever he went. ”

“Now, he didn’t smile anymore. ”

“For seven days in a row, Ye Sen worked overtime almost every day and even settled two big contracts. ”

“In addition, Ye Sen was still planning to expand the company. ”

“In the afternoon, the Sun was hot. ”

Ye Sen and Lin Ze had agreed to meet today.

“Before they met, Ye Sen went home to get something. ”

“Just as he parked the car and walked to the entrance of the building, he saw ye Zhuo talking and laughing with a man as they walked out. ”

“The man was dressed in a long robe with a string of Buddhist beads in his hand. His temperament was transcendent, making people unable to catch up to him. ”

“The girl beside him was devastatingly beautiful. Her features were like a painting, and her entire body exuded an otherworldly temperament with a hint of coldness. ”
