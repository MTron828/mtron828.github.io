“After adding wechat, Li hang continued, “My family lives on Linsha Island. I welcome all of you to come and play. I’ll definitely treat you to a meal.” ”

“Dog two said, “Okay, I’ll definitely go.” ”

“”Ah Ze.”At this moment, Bai Jingshu walked over from the side. ”

She was three months pregnant and was starting to show signs of pregnancy.

“Jingshu.”Lin Ze immediately walked over to help her up.

Li Hang was stunned.

Who Was This?

Lin Ze’s wife?

Lin Ze was already married?

It was a pity that such an outstanding person actually got married at an early age.

Li Hang’s eyes were filled with pity.

“However, it might not necessarily be a wife. Perhaps they were sisters? ”

“Is this sister-in-law?”Li Hang continued to speak.

“Lin Ze nodded. “This is my wife, Bai Jingshu.” ”

“When he heard this, Li Hang’s lowered eyes were filled with regret. ”

She had thought that Lin Ze was a golden bachelor.

Who would have thought...

“After saying this, Lin Ze looked at Bai Jingshu. “Jingshu, this is Lizi’s cousin.” ”

“As for Li Hang’s name, Lin Ze had already forgotten it. ”

“”Hello, I’m Bai Jingshu.” ” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“”Mrs. Lin, I’m Li Hang. Mu Zi Li, Qihang’s hang.” ”

“Bai Jingshu shook hands with Li Hang and said with a smile, “Miss Li’s name is very nice.” ”

“”Thank you,”Li Hang said. “In the industry, literature and art are the most important, and Jingshu’s name is the most beautiful. Mrs. Lin’s name is even better.” ”

Bai Jingshu smiled. “Thank you.”

“After saying that, Bai Jingshu looked at Lin Ze and continued, “AH ZE, MOM asked us to go over.” ”

“Okay.”Lin Ze nodded and followed Bai Jingshu’s footsteps.

Fat Tiger looked at dog two and mosquito. “I heard that Xiao Li and the others are here as well. Let’s go over and take a look.”

“”Okay.”Dog two nodded and turned to look at Li Hang. “I’m sorry, cousin Li Hang. Please excuse us.” ”

Li Hang looked at the handsome and rich man in front of him and once again envied an Lizi’s good fortune.

“After a while, Li hang nodded. “You guys go quickly. Don’t worry about me.” ”

“Buttface, fat tiger, and Mosquito walked to the other side. ”

Li Hang looked at the backs of the three people and a look of determination flashed across his eyes.

“Although she couldn’t get a glance from Cen Wu Ye, she could start with Ouyang Cheng. ”

“After all, Ouyang Cheng didn’t really love an Lizi. ”

“It could be seen that Ouyang Cheng was very shaken now. If he met a girl he truly liked, he would definitely abandon an Lizi. ”

“With this in mind, Li Hang found a quiet seat and sat down. ”

He opened wechat and found the four people who had just been added.

“They were Lin Ze, Li Wen, Chu Yan, and Ouyang Cheng. ”

“After getting rid of Lin Ze and Ouyang Cheng, Li Hang scrolled through Chu Yan and Li Wen’s circle of friends and found that Chu Yan and Li Wen were not ordinary people. ”

They each had their own businesses under their names.

A wealthy family was indeed a wealthy family.

Just a few of them were already so outstanding. Those from small families really could not be compared to them.

“Li hang curled the corners of his lips and turned to look at an Lizi, who was talking to Ouyang Cheng not far away. The look of determination in his eyes was even more obvious. ”

Wait.

She would definitely take root in this wealthy family.

She wanted to give her next generation a better birth!

...

Li Hang’s family bought a three-bedroom house in the capital city.

“The price of a house in the capital city was expensive, and the houses in the city had reached more than 100,000 yuan per square meter. A three-bedroom house could not be bought without thousands of houses. ”

“Moreover, her family also had a two-bedroom house, which was rented out. ”

“Therefore, Li hang always had a sense of superiority in front of his relatives and friends, as well as in front of his classmates. ”

“When her friends of the same age were still struggling for a house and a car, she already had everything. ”

“But today, when she stood in front of the apartment building in the neighborhood again, the sense of superiority in her heart had disappeared completely. ”

“After all, what she saw today was the big villa that an Lizi lived in, the beautiful backyard, and the banquet hall of the Lin family alone was even bigger than their three-bedroom house. ”

“Therefore, Li hang only saw the mess. ”

Why could an lizi live in such a beautiful villa while she could only live in such a shabby place?

Just because she didn’t die of her father?

No.

No.

She wasn’t convinced.

“In terms of appearance, she was prettier than an Lizi. ”

“In terms of education, she was already in graduate school. ”

“In terms of birth, she grew up with a golden spoon in her mouth. ”

Why was Anlizi living a better life than her now?

“Li hang stood in front of the apartment building, took a deep breath, and walked inside. ”

“As soon as he walked in, he saw a group of people gathered at the elevator entrance. ”
