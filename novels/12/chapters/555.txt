Translator: 549690339

“”Alright.”Old Lady Lin nodded and continued, “Please apologize to your brother on my behalf. It’s me, an old woman, who let him down.” ”

Zhao shuning took the car and left first. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“He had just arrived at Zhao Shuqi’s work unit. When he reached the hall, he saw Zhao Shuqi walking out of the room in a daze. ”

“”Brother, are you alright?” ”

“When he saw Zhao shuning walking over, Zhao Shuqi flipped his hand and slapped him. ”

Zhao shuning had always been the one who slapped Lin Qingxuan. When had Zhao shuning ever received a slap from someone else? This slap stunned Zhao shuning. “Brother?”

Zhao Shuqi raised his hand and slapped him again.

Zhao shuning stumbled and fell to the ground.

The feeling of being slapped wasn’t good. Zhao shuning only felt his head buzzing. He could see stars and was in so much pain that he could hardly breathe.

Zhao Shuqi looked at Zhao shuning. “You made me lose my job. You’re Happy Now!”

Lose his job?

“Hearing this, Zhao shuning looked up in disbelief. ”

How could this be?

“No matter how powerful Lin Jin city was, it was impossible for Zhao Shuqi to lose his job. ”

“After all, Zhao Shuqi was currently at the peak of his career. ”

“”Brother, there must be a mistake!”Zhao shuning looked up at Zhao Shuqi. “There must be a mistake! How could this be so serious? !” ”

“Zhao shuqi roared, “Get lost! Get lost! I don’t have a sister like you in the future!” ”

Losing his job completely was a torture and humiliation for Zhao Shuqi.

“Although his sister was important, his career was more important to Zhao Shuqi! ”

But now.

It was all ruined!

It was all ruined by Zhao Shuning’s hands.

“Not to mention severing ties, Zhao Shuqi even wanted to kill someone. ”

Zhao shuning panicked as well.

She never dreamed that things would turn out like this.

“Looking at Zhao Shuqi’s back as he left, she shouted, “Brother! Brother!” ”

But Zhao Shuqi did not turn around.

“After a long while, Zhao shuning got up from the ground, stumbled to the car by the roadside, and drove to the Zhao family home. ”

Father Zhao was furious with Zhao shuning.

He was lying on the bed and receiving an IV.

“Originally, Zhao Shuqi was his proudest son. ”

But now...

This proudest son had become the Zhao family’s humiliation in the blink of an eye.

“Madam Zhao stood in front of the bed and said hesitantly, “Old Zhao, Shuning is back.” ”

“”Get lost! Tell her to get lost!”Hearing Zhao Shuning’s words, Father Zhao wished he could get up from the bed and give Zhao shuning a good beating. ”

Madam Zhao wiped away her tears.

“She had given birth to both her son and daughter. As a mother, she felt both sorry for her son and her daughter. “Shuning didn’t do it on purpose. Besides, the child already knows her mistake.” ”

It was just a name change. Who knew it would cause so much trouble.

“Father Zhao looked at Madam Zhao and shouted angrily, “How kind of a woman! That girl has been spoiled! Shut Up!” ”

Madam Zhao immediately shut up.

“Father Zhao took a deep breath and continued, “How is Shuqi Now?” ”

“”He’s in the study upstairs,”Madam Zhao replied. ”

“Father Zhao continued, “Shuqi is also brainless! I’ve already told him not to get carried away. Don’t get carried away. If you get carried away, it’s easy to become extremely happy and sad! Look, when has he ever listened to me?” ”

“Zhao Shuqi could have avoided this oversight, but he was too proud. ”

“In the end, this was not only Zhao Shuning’s fault. ”

Madam Zhao sighed.

“A moment later, Madam Zhao walked out of the room. ”

“In the living room, the maid was using ice cubes to reduce the swelling on Zhao shuning’s face. When she saw Madam Zhao, Zhao shuning immediately stood up from the sofa. “Mom, what did my dad say?” ”

Mrs. Zhao shook her head. “You should go back first.”

Zhao shuning looked inside and then looked away. “Then... Then I’ll go back first.”

“”Go back.”Mrs. Zhao sighed. “It’s already happened. No matter how much you say, it’s useless. Don’t worry, I’ll talk to your dad and your brother.” ”

“Okay.”Zhao shuning nodded and had no choice but to go back first.

“As soon as Zhao shuning walked out of the Zhao family’s door, Mrs. Zhao chased after him. ”

“Shuning! Wait!”

“”Mom, What’s Wrong?”Zhao shuning turned to look at Mrs. Zhao. ”

“Mrs. Zhao continued, “Your father told me to tell you to remember to be smart the next time you do something. That daughter of Lin Jincheng is not an ordinary person. Her identity is very mysterious. You must not offend her again!” ”

Ye Zao?

“Zhao shuning really did not know. Other than speaking Arabic, what else was unusual about ye Zao? ”
