“You Suspect Me?”Cen Shaoqing turned to look at Yu Mumu.

“Could it be that it wasn’t you?”Yu Mumu asked.

“Although it was a rhetorical question, Yu Mumu said it in a declarative tone. ”

Cen Shaoqing chuckled. “It really wasn’t me.” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

He wanted to help ye Zhuo.

But Ye Zhuo didn’t need it at all.

“Yu Niannian said somewhat speechlessly, “I already know. Stop pretending.” ”

What was there to pretend about.

“Don’t tell me that your little girlfriend is really some God Ye?”

Wasn’t this a fantasy?

She really treated him like a three-year-old child.

“”There’s a car recorder. Go and see for yourself,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

Car Recorder?

“Yu Luonian narrowed his eyes and continued, “Give me the car keys.” ”

“”They’re in the car,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

Yu Luonian walked to the side of the car.

He wanted to see who was driving.

He would not believe it until he saw it with his own eyes.

“Soon, he came to the side of the car. ”

“The car door was not locked. Yu Luonian opened the door, sat in the driver’s seat, and pulled out the driving recorder. ”

“At the beginning, it was the scene of Ye Zao sitting in front of the driver’s seat. ”

Yu Luonian narrowed his eyes.

Could it really be ye Zao who drove the car?

How could this be!

“Yu Luonian frowned, his expression somewhat complicated. ”

The speed of the car at the beginning was not fast.

It must have been replaced by Cen Shaoqing Midway.

“Just five minutes after the time of the recording device had passed, the speed of the car suddenly increased. ”

There was no replacement!

It was still ye Zao!

It was really ye Zao!

This was too out of his expectations.

Yu Sunset’s eyes widened. He even thought that he was hallucinating.

Why was it ye Zao?

Was that ye Zao at the Fatal Bend Too?

Impossible.

How Old Was Ye Zao this year?

How could she have such an ability?

Impossible!

“Soon, they reached the fatal bend. ”

Cen Shaoqing’s voice appeared on the recording device.

“The car in front is Sunset’s car.”

“Do you want to slow down?”It was ye Zao’s voice.

“No need.”Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads.

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Then I’ll speed up.”

“Okay.”

The car sped up in an instant.

Boom —

The speed became faster and faster.

Faster and faster!

Yu sunset rubbed her eyes. She could hardly believe what she was seeing.

“But no matter how hard she rubbed her eyes, the scene before her eyes did not change. ”

The person driving the car was ye Zao.

“Until he finished reading all the records, Yu Sunset was in a daze. ”

He did not understand how ye Zao became God Ye!

“Could it really be that he had hit rock bottom, Ye Zao? ”

What on Earth was going on?

“When he walked to Cen Shaoqing’s side, Yu sunset was still confused. ”

“Did you see it?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“I saw it.”Yu sunset nodded.

“Cen Shaoqing looked up at Yu sunset and asked, “Do you believe it now?” ”

No.

“Until now, Yu sunset still did not believe what he saw. ”

“Is your little girlfriend Really God Ye?”Yu sunset asked.

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Actually, God Ye was also Yu Sunset’s idol. ”

“He had always been curious about God Ye’s true appearance, but God ye was too mysterious. He had no chance to see it at all. ”

“But now, Cen Shaoqing suddenly told him that ye Zhuo was the legendary God Ye. ”

God Ye was actually a little girl. This made Yu sunset somewhat unable to accept it.

His worldview suddenly exploded.

“”I. . .”Yu Sunset’s expression was very complicated. “Why, this is too sudden...” ”

“There are many things that can make you suddenly.”Cen Shaoqing’s tone was low as he twirled the Buddhist beads.

This sentence contained too much content.

Could it be that ye Zhuo still had an unknown identity?

“”Zixu, I’m a little flustered with you like this.”He was really a little flustered. ”

Yu sunset was completely dumbfounded.

Ye Zao was really too different from what he had imagined.

Cen Shaoqing turned his eyes slightly. “You’re flustered just like that?”

“Yu sunset gulped. “Zixu, are you joking with me?” ”

He was definitely joking.

He was already very surprised that ye Zao was God Ye.

“But now, Cen Shaoqing told him that ye Zao had many other identities. ”

And it was very likely that he had an identity that could blow everyone away.

“What kind of joke is this?”Cen Shaoqing looked at Yu Niannian.

“Yu Niannian continued, “Is your little girlfriend really that powerful?” ”

“”She’s more powerful than me anyway,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

More powerful than Cen Shaoqing?

Impossible!

This was simply impossible!

“”Zixu, I’m very serious now,”Yu Niannian looked at Cen Shaoqing and said. ”

“Cen Shaoqing looked at the old age, “I am also very serious.” ”
