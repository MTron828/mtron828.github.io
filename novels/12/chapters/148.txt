Chapter 149: 085: the Clever Lin Ze, who was at his peak when he debuted! 1

A 19-year-old child.

In an ordinary family, he would have long been the pillar of support.

But Lin Ze was still so insensible.

Old Mrs. Lin’s eyes were filled with anger.

Feng Qianhua continued to comfort old Mrs. Lin. “Aunt Lin, some children mature early, and some mature late. Don’t be too anxious. Ah Ze will be sensible one day.”

It would have been better if Feng Qianhua had not said this, but when she said this, old madam Lin felt even worse.

One day, Lin Ze will grow up.

But when will this one day be?

When Will Lin Ze grow up?

Before he can grow up?

Thinking of this, Old Madam Lin’s eyes were filled with sorrow as she grabbed Feng Qianhua’s hand, she sighed and said, “I don’t expect anything now. I only hope that you can give birth to a grandson for me. Ah Ze is the only child in Jin city now. Ah Ze doesn’t know how to be vigilant in times of danger!”

Feng Qianhua’s eyes revealed a hint of shyness. “Aunt Lin...”

“What’s there to be shy about? I’m not an outsider!”

Feng Qianhua continued, “Aunt Lin, you should know that this kind of thing is a matter of mutual consent. Jin city only has ye Shu in its heart. Actually, as long as I can see Jin city living a happy life, I’m very satisfied.”

“That B * Tch doesn’t deserve it!”Old Lady Lin said fiercely.

Feng Qianhua sighed and tried to speak up for ye Shu, but Old Lady Lin seemed to have read her mind. “Qianhua, you don’t have to speak up for her! I know very well what kind of person ye Shu is!”

Having said that, Feng Qianhua had no choice but to change the topic.

“Aunt Lin, the plum blossoms in the garden have been blooming well these few days. Shall we go to the garden to admire the flowers?”

“Okay!”Old Mrs. Lin nodded.

The red plum blossoms in the garden were like a fire, embellishing the white snow. Such a beautiful scene made people involuntarily gasp in amazement.

...

Yun Jing.

In the small restaurant, with Ye Sen’s guidance, Lin Ze’s mood was much better. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Ye Sen was afraid that this kid wouldn’t be able to get over it.

So, he sent him back to the hotel where he stayed, and the two of them added each other on wechat, “Ah Ze, my home is just over here. I’ve already sent the address to your wechat. If you’re in a bad mood, you can ask me out for a drink, or you can go to my home for a home-cooked meal.”

“Thank you, Uncle Ye.”Lin Ze bowed deeply to him.

“You’re welcome.”Ye Sen patted Lin Ze’s shoulder. “Everyone has their ups and downs. Hurry up and go in!”

Lin Ze turned around and walked into the hotel.

Ye Sen watched him enter the hotel before leaving.

“Lin Ze.”Ye Sen whispered Lin Ze’s name, feeling a little strange.

He didn’t know why, but he felt that Lin Ze was very friendly.

It was as if he was really his long-lost relative.

Could it be an illusion?

Ye Sen frowned and did not think too much about it.

The Lin family moved very quickly.

Four hours later, they arrived in Yunjing.

It was nine o’clock at night.

The housekeeper brought a few bodyguards and went straight to Lin Ze’s hotel.

Knock, Knock, Knock

The housekeeper began to knock on the door.

Lin Ze frowned slightly. Who Was it at this time of night?

Under normal circumstances, the hotel would not bother the guests at this time of night.

Therefore, this was definitely not a hotel staff member.

Lin Ze quickly picked up the laptop, pressed the mouse with one hand, and operated the keyboard with one hand. Not long after, he hacked into the hotel’s internal system and turned on the surveillance cameras in the hotel corridor.

It was indeed not the hotel staff standing outside the door.

It was the Butler!

Why was the Butler Here?

Lin Ze narrowed his eyes. Grandma must have known about his itinerary.

He had just arrived in Yunjing when the butler followed him.

What did this mean?

It meant that his mother must be in Yunjing!

When he heard the news, Lin Ze was ecstatic.

It was not in vain!

Although he could not find his mother, his trip to Yun Jing was not in vain.

Lin Ze restored his computer to its original state and walked over to open the door.

“Young Master!”The Butler bowed respectfully.

“Grandpa Butler, why are you here?”Lin Ze asked in surprise.

The butler said, “Young Master, the old lady is very angry. Please come back with us.”

“Why is grandma angry?”Lin Ze was a little confused.

The housekeeper looked at Lin Ze with a complicated expression. “Young master, Please.”

Lin Ze continued, “Wait a moment. I still have things to pack.”

The housekeeper looked at the bodyguards behind him. “Just let them pack.”

“Then I’ll get a phone and a computer.”Lin Ze walked into the house. When he came back again, he had a phone and a computer in his hand.
