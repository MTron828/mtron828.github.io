What right does a low-level earthling have?

“Seeing her like this, Mrs. Duanmu continued, “Fengyou, your bright future is still in the future. Don’t do anything that will destroy your future.” ”

Duanmu Fengyou nodded.

Chang Yue.

Qiu Di had been preparing for the general election these few days.

“However, there were still two things that had not been resolved. ”

“First, collecting the clothes spirits. ”

“Second, opening the information on the trans-star case. ”

Qiu Di massaged his temples with a slight headache.

“At this moment, his assistant knocked on the door from outside, “Eldest miss.” ”

“Come in.”Qiu Di raised his head.

The assistant raised his feet and walked in.

“What is it?”Qiu Di asked.

“The sixth clan leader is looking for you.”The assistant said.

The sixth clan leader?

“Among the eight great clans, the sixth clan leader was the most ordinary. Usually, it was almost impossible to notice him. ”

“At this time, what was the sixth clan leader looking for her for? ”

“Let him in.”Autumn flute said.

“Okay.”

The assistant nodded and walked out.

“Soon, the sixth clan leader came in. ”

“Miss Autumn.”The sixth clan leader walked in with a smile.

“Of course, Qiu di greeted him with a smile, “Sixth chief, please take a seat.” ”

“The sixth chief sat down on the chair and continued, “The day of the general election is coming soon. I wonder if Lady Qiu is ready?” ”

“”As long as all the Chiefs believe in me, I think I will not let down Lady Ye’s request.”Qiu Di said. ”

Her words were telling the sixth chief that everything she did was because of ye Zhuo.

“The sixth chief forced out a smile and continued, “Lady Qiu, take a look at this.” ”

“As he finished speaking, he took out a document and handed it to Qiu Di. ”

Qiu Di took the document. His expression changed and his hands trembled.

“The sixth chief calmly took a sip of tea and continued, “Lady Qiu, don’t Be Nervous. Other than Lady Ye, only I know this secret.” ”

“”What do you mean?”Qiu Di looked at the sixth chief, her eyes filled with vigilance. ”

The sixth chief placed the cup on the table. “Lady Ye is already a dead person. Dead people don’t speak. What does Lady Qiu Think I want to Do?”

Qiu Di narrowed her eyes.

“Seeing Qiu di like this, the sixth chief laughed out loud and continued, “Lady Qiu, if I wanted to do something, I would have done it long ago. Would I have waited until now?” ”

“What exactly do you want to Do?”Qiu Di continued.

“”Let’s work together.”The six clan leaders continued, “I know that the person behind you is the Great Witch Doctor.” ”

“Tell me your motive.”

“”Lady Qiu is indeed a smart person. No wonder the Great Witch Doctor chose you!”The six clan leaders continued, “After the matter is done, the clothes spirit will belong to me.” ”

The clothes spirit will belong to him?

Wait a minute...

How did the six clan leaders know that the clothes spirit was in her hands.

“The six clan leaders seemed to have seen through Qiu Di’s thoughts and continued, “Since I can know Lady Qiu’s secret, I have a way to find out where the clothes spirit went.” ”

“What do you want the clothes spirit for?”

“”This has nothing to do with you.”The six clan leaders continued, “In order to show my sincerity, I can tell you the method to activate the information of the star crossing case.” ”

“Really?”Qiu Di raised her head and asked.

“A gentleman’s word is his bond!”The six clan leaders said.

“Okay!”

“The six clan leaders took out an electronic contract, “Words have no proof. Sign the contract as evidence to prevent Miss Qiu from forgetting things when the time comes.” ”

Qiu Di carefully looked at the contract and immediately signed her name on the contract.

“The six clan leaders put away the contract and handed a black box to qiu di, “The method to open the information on the star crossing case is here.” ”

Qiu Di took the information.

The Sixth Patriarch went all the way home.

There was a secret room in the Guang family that even the servants didn’t know about.

The sixth patriarch walked all the way to the secret room.

“Although it was a secret room, it was extremely bright inside, as bright as day. ”

The sixth patriarch went all the way to the room on the left of the secret room. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

It was different from the other rooms.

“There was a big iron cage in this room, and in the iron cage was a teenager who looked about eighteen or nineteen years old. ”

“The youth’s gaze was dull, and he kept smiling foolishly at the place where the lights were. ”

“Xing ‘er!”

The sixth chief walked over with red eyes.

“Seeing the sixth chief, the youth excitedly clapped, “Toad! hahaha! The toad is Here!” ”

“”Xing ‘er, it’s me!”The sixth chief looked at the youth, “I’m Daddy.” ”

“He didn’t know if it was that sentence that provoked the youth, but the youth instantly became extremely agitated. He used his head to slam straight against the iron door, like an enraged lion, “I’m going to kill you! I’m going to kill you!” ”

The iron door was smashed with a loud bang.

“The sixth clan leader saw his only son become like this, and his heart ached so much that tears fell, “Xing ‘er, Xing ‘er, don’t worry. I have already found Yi Ling’s whereabouts. You will soon return to normal! We will soon be able to live a normal life.” ”
