“Ye Zhuo shook his head slightly. “Elder Zhang should have told her, but she didn’t believe it, so elder Zhang Found Me.””

Old Madam Lin frowned. “Muddle-headed! Really too muddle-headed!”

“Seeing how muddle-headed ye Langhua was, old madam Lin thought back to her past self.”

She must have been even more hateful than the current ye Langhua.

...

On the other side.

At the Xi family home.

“Because elder Zhang was unwilling to help, Aunt Lang personally came forward and called the director of the Shunxi Financial Group, the lawyer.”

The lawyer was a very efficient person.

She promised Aunt Lang that she would definitely come to the Xi family home today to take Xi Weiyue back to handle the succession procedures.

The lawyer had not arrived yet.

“The XI family all sat in the hall, waiting for the lawyer to arrive.”

The agreed time was 11 am.

It was already 10:30 am.

Xi Muwen smoked one cigarette after another.

“Xi Weiyue was also a little anxious, afraid that something would go wrong again.”

“A mother knows her daughter like a mother. Yang Jiao patted Xi Weiyue’s hand. “Weiyue, don’t worry. Don’t worry about your aunt. Director si will definitely arrive on time.””

“Aunt Lang smiled. “Yes, Weiyue. You Don’t have to worry.””

Xi Weiyue nodded.

“At this moment, Aunt Lang’s phone suddenly rang.”

“”Hello, elder Zhang.”Aunt Lang picked up the phone.”

“”Lang Hua, where are you now?”Elder Zhang’s voice came from the phone screen. “I have something very happy to tell you!””

“You can tell me over the phone.”

“Elder Zhang continued, “The results are out! The matriarch of the Lin family, Ye Shu, is Xiao Banyue! You two are biological mother and daughter!””

“What?”Aunt Lang took the phone and walked outside.

“Seeing Aunt Lang like this, the three people in the room looked at each other. Xi Weiyue used her eyes to signal for Jiang Yan to go out and take a look.”

Jiang Yan immediately understood and walked out of the door.

“She saw Aunt Lang holding her phone, and her expression was a little ugly. “Appraisal? What did you guys use to get the appraisal? Why didn’t I know?””

“Little Half Moon was clearly beside her, but Zhang Laofei said that ye Shu was only little half moon.”

This made Aunt Lang very disgusted! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“She did not want to go back to the financial world in the first place, so she did not want to go back to the financial world even more!”

“When she heard this, Jiang Yan, who was listening from the corner, felt her heart skip a beat.”

It’s over!

Could it be that elder Zhang had found the real half a month?

“Jiang Yan’s face was slightly pale, and her hand that was holding onto the door frame was trembling.”

“Elder zhang said, “Take your hair and half a month’s hair. Lang Hua, I’m really not lying to you! Ye Shu was really half a month! There were still many secrets in the past. Losing half a month was also because of Xi Muwen’s intention. These words could not be clearly said on the phone. Come out for a moment, let’s meet and talk.””

“Aunt Lang said directly, “Elder Zhang, how many times do you want me to say it? It’s impossible for me to return to the financial world! “From now on, let Weiyue take my place! “It’s fine if you’re not willing to help me deliver the recommendation letter. I’ve already contacted the director myself! “Just die and let me return to the financial world!””

“At the end of her sentence, Aunt Lang hung up the phone.”

Elder Zhang frowned when he saw the phone being hung up.

How Stupid!

How Stupid!

Cao Wei turned to elder Zhang when he saw the phone being hung up. “What did Auntie Lang Say?”

“Elder zhang said, “She doesn’t trust us anymore! Let’s go to the Lin Family First!””

“Okay.”Cao Wei nodded.

The two of them set off for the Lin family home.

Xi family home.

11 am sharp.

The lawyer arrived at the Xi family home on time.

“When he heard the Butler’s announcement, Xi Muwen immediately stood up from his chair. “Weiyue, let’s go out and welcome the chairman.””

“The lawyer was the chairman of Shunxi Financial Group. Even though XI Weiyue’s starting point was grandfather Ye’s heir, she was still a newcomer after all, so it was not wrong for her to rope in more servants.”

Xi Weiyue stood up as well.

The two of them walked out of the door and saw a tall figure pushing open the car door and getting out.

The person was dressed in a neat hand-cut suit and wore a pair of gold-rimmed glasses. His facial features were very exquisite and his aura was strong. He looked like he was about twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old. One look and one could tell that he was an elite in the business world!

“”This is the chairman of the company, right?”Xi Muwen walked forward.”

The lawyer closed the car door and turned to look at Xi Muwen. “You’re Mr. Xi?”

“Xi Muwen nodded. “This is my daughter, Xi Weiyue.””

“”Hello, chairman Si. I’m Xi Weiyue. Please guide me in the future.”Xi Weiyue generously extended her right hand to the lawyer.”

“The lawyer sized up XI Weiyue. His eyes were full of scrutiny. His gaze was a little heavy as he said, “Hello, Miss XI.””
