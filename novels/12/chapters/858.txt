Translator: 549690339

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Just don’t mind the taste when the time comes.””

“I definitely won’t mind!”

Chang Yu and Wei Xingzhi also looked at Ye Zao in surprise.

Their eyes were filled with disbelief.

Ye Zao was too unscrupulous in order to appear on camera.

He actually requested to take the initiative to cook?

Could the food she cooked be eaten?

This was not how one would show off!

“Song Chenyu glanced at ye Zao, her eyes filled with ridicule.”

Why would ye Zao take the initiative to take on the task of cooking?

Wasn’t it because he wanted to compete with her?

He wanted to compete with her?

What right did ye Zao have?

Her culinary skills came from the hands of a five-star chef. Where was ye Zao?

“For a delicate little girl like ye Zao, she probably did not even know how to hold a spatula.”

However.

A certain Internet celebrity joining a variety show to blow up the kitchen was also a gimmick.

Thinking of this. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

A mocking look flashed across song Chenyu’s eyes.

“After the job of cooking was clearly divided, the director continued, “Oh right, the fish pond on the west side is also ours. If you guys want to eat fish, you can go to the fish pond to fish for fish.””

“In the following time, the director brought everyone to their respective rooms.”

There were four rooms in total.

“Two people in one room, just enough for eight people.”

Ye Zhuo and Yin Wei lived together.

Song Chenyu and song Yiwan lived together.

The remaining four boys lived in two rooms each.

In the afternoon.

“Everyone first mowed the grass and came back to feed the cows, then went to pick watermelons.”

They came to the back of the mountain in a big way.

There was a large patch of white grass growing on the back of the mountain.

The few of them took their tools and began to mow the grass.

Mowing the grass was not difficult.

“However, it was too difficult for these big stars who had never done farm work before.”

Song Chenyu had never done this kind of work before. He held a knife and was somewhat at a loss.

“Fortunately, Wang Xuancheng had participated in such a program before. He smiled and said, “If any of you don’t know how to Mow the grass, you can learn from me. Actually, this is very simple.””

“Song Chenyu was a studious person, so he immediately learned from Wang Xuancheng.”

“Ah!”

“At this moment, a sharp knife cut song Chenyu’s finger.”

Bright red blood flowed out of the wound.

“What happened to Chenyu?”Lu Qi immediately threw the knife and walked toward song Chenyu.

“Song Chenyu pinched his injured finger and said, “I accidentally cut my finger.””

“”Quick, let me take a look. Are You Alright?”Lu Qi said nervously, “Does it hurt?””

“Song Yiwan came over and said, “I’ll go get a band-aid!””

Wang Xuancheng stopped mowing the grass as well. A few people surrounded song Chenyu and asked about his well-being.

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “It’s just a little cut. You’ll be fine once you get a band-aid. Hurry up and mow the grass. Don’t delay the mowing. The cow is still waiting to eat at home.””

Lu Qi’s heart ached terribly.

“Song Chenyu was already injured to this extent, yet he was still concerned about the cow.”

“This program team was really inhumane. Even if song Chenyu was injured, no one cared.”

“Not long after, song yiwan ran over with the band-aid.”

“”Chenyu, let me put it on you.””

Song Chenyu reached out his hand.

Song Yiwan carefully put the band-aid on.

“After putting the band-aid on, song Chenyu took his knife and continued cutting the grass.”

“Seeing that song Chenyu was working with injuries, everyone was shocked and immediately stopped him. “Chenyu, it’s just a little grass. We can cut it three times. Stand in the shade and rest for a while.””

Song Chenyu shook his head. “It’s just a little cut on my finger. It doesn’t hurt at all.”

Lu Qi snatched the knife from song Chenyu’s hand. “Go and rest! There’s a banyan tree over there. Just stand under the tree and wait for us.”

Song Chenyu had no choice but to stand under the banyan tree and wait for them.

The remaining three continued to mow the grass.

“Song Yiwan had been a second-generation rich child since she was young and had never done such tiring work. Soon, she was so tired that her back ached and sweat poured down like rain. Even the makeup she had carefully put on melted away.”

She did not need to look in the mirror to know how pathetic she was at this moment.

“Then, she looked at song Chenyu under the Banyan Tree.”

“She sat there quietly. The white clothes on her body blended with the white clouds in the sky, and she was so beautiful that she could explode.”

Song Yiwan frowned. How come she was not the one who cut her hand?

“First, song Chenyu cut her hand.”

“If she cut her hand again, her intention would be too obvious.”

On the red team’s side.

The four of them also came to another area where white grass grew.

“Here, the Blue Sky and White Clouds, the gentle breeze, the fragrance of flowers, and the crisp chirping of birds accompanied them.”

“Yin Wei sighed and said, “The scenery here is so beautiful!””

Ye Zhuo took out his phone to take a photo.

Wei Xingzhi and Chang Yu stood behind the two of them.

“Wei xingzhi smiled and teased, “Wei Wei, Yezi, we didn’t come here today to enjoy the scenery. Hurry up and cut the grass. There are still watermelons to pick from the wrist-cutting grass.””

“As he said that, Wei Xingzhi gave the blade to the three of them.”

“Yin Wei held the blade and looked at ye Zao. “Yezi, have you ever cut grass before?””

Ye Zao shook his head.

It was within the expectations of the others that ye Zao did not know how to cut grass.

They did not expect ye Zao to know how to cut grass. They just hoped that ye Zao would not give them any trouble.

“Yin Wei continued, “I’ve cut rice before when I participated in other programs. I can teach you later.””

“Okay.”

Yin Wei began to teach ye Zhuo how to cut grass.

“Although it was called teaching, ye Zhuo actually learned it after watching it once.”

“After all, it was not a job that required skill.”

“Yin Wei smiled and said, “Ye, you’re so Smart!””

“It’s just that cutting grass is too easy.”Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly.

“She did her work very methodically and did not think of slacking off. She was very serious. She was clearly a little girl, but she did not lose to the boys present at all. In a short while, she had cut a big basket and began to cut the second basket.”

“Seeing this, Wei Xingzhi and Chang Yu were a little surprised.”

They had thought that ye Zao would be lazy.

“They did not expect that not only did ye Zao not slack off, he was even better than them!”

“While cutting, ye Zao suddenly found a big cluster of red things in the grass.”

It was a thorn bubble.

“Thorn bubble was a wild fruit, its scientific name was raspberry.”

Ye Zao’s eyes lit up and he quickly picked a thorn bubble to taste.

The taste was sweet and sour. It tasted very good.

“Hence, he picked a second one and a third one.”

“After eating the fifth one, Ye Zao looked at Yin Wei. “Wei Wei!””

“What’s Wrong?”Yin Wei ran over.

“Ye Zao continued, “There are thorny bubbles here. Do you want to eat them?””

“”Thorny bubbles?”Yin Wei had lived in the metropolis since she was young and had never seen this before. She asked curiously, “Can this be eaten? Is it poisonous?””

“It’s not poisonous. I’ve already eaten a few of them.”

Yin Wei was still a little worried. “Is it really not poisonous?”

“Ye Zhuo picked one and put it into his mouth. “Don’t worry, it’s really not poisonous.””

Yin Wei swallowed her throat and picked another one as well. She put it into her mouth and frowned as she chewed carefully.

The pulp of the fruit exploded in her mouth.

“In an instant, the juice was overflowing.”

It was sweet and sour.

It tasted even better than strawberries.

“Yin Wei looked at ye Zao in surprise. “The taste is indeed very good! Yezi, what did you say this fruit was called?””

“”Spiny bubbles.”Ye Zao continued, “We can pick a little more now and eat it as fruit after dinner tonight.””

“”Okay, I agree!”Yin Wei ate as she picked.”

Ye Zao looked around and found a banana tree not far away. He immediately trotted over and picked a banana leaf.

The banana leaf was very big and could be folded into a bowl.

“After a while, the two of them picked a full bowl.”

Wei Xingzhi and Chang Yu walked over curiously. “What are you two doing?”

Yin Wei looked back at the two of them. “Yezi found wild strawberries here. Do you want to try them?”

The shape of the spicules was very similar to wild strawberries and the taste was similar to strawberries. That was true.

“Wild strawberries?”Chang Yu was a little surprised.

“Yin Wei nodded. She grabbed a handful of spiny bubbles and handed it to Chang Yu and Wei Xingzhi. “Teacher Wei, Chang Yu, try it and see how it tastes.””

“The two of them took the spiny bubbles and tasted it. The taste was very good, and a look of surprise flashed across their eyes.”

“Wei xingzhi smiled and said, “My daughter will definitely like this wild strawberry.””

“Chang Yu continued, “Teacher Wei, how old is your daughter this year?””

“She’s eight this year.”

“”Then she should be in the first grade, right?””

“”Yes, she’ll be in the second grade in the second half of the year,”Wei Xingzhi replied.”

“After picking the thorny blisters, the three of them went to the watermelon field to pick the watermelons.”

Picking the watermelons was very simple.

“However, the problem was how to transport them back,”

“on average, each watermelon weighed more than ten catties, and the heavy ones weighed more than twenty catties.”

On the blue team’s side.

The four of them quickly finished picking the watermelons on a plot of land and discussed how to get the watermelons back.

“Lu Qi took off his straw hat and looked at song Chenyu. “This kind of hard work should be done by US boys. You two girls should go back first. Doesn’t Chenyu still have to cook? Yi Wan, go help Chenyu.””
