Chapter 119: 078: an unknown past! Brother Ze, your birth mother might be in Yun Jing! 5

Grandfather Yang solemnly expressed his gratitude to Ye Zhuo and brought a document with him. “Little Miracle Doctor Ye, this is 30% of the shares of our Yang Group. Please accept it.”

30% of the shares looked very small.

In fact, it was a huge amount.

The total assets of the Yang Group was 100 billion. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

If converted into a number, it was 3 billion.

This 3 billion was only the current amount. After all, the annual benefits of the Yang Group was not just this number.

Grandfather Yang did not give 30% of the shares, but half of the Yang Group.

Ye Zao stood up from his chair and refused, “Grandfather Yang, when I left your house that day, you already gave me a generous gift. I can’t accept this 30% of the shares!”

“Little Miracle Doctor Ye, you saved my life. You can accept this share.”

Ye Zao smiled, “Grandfather Yang, the duty of a doctor is to save people. This is what I should do. You Don’t have to take it to heart.”

Grandpa Yang fell into his memories, then, he said, “Although that’s what you said, the doctors have already announced that my illness is a death syndrome. You were the one who snatched me back from death. Last Winter, those doctors told me that I wouldn’t be able to survive this winter.”

“Grandpa Yang, I’m still a student. Even if I really took your shares, I wouldn’t be able to manage the company. I know nothing about the brewing industry. Wouldn’t it be a waste of God’s gift if you gave me your shares?”? “So, you should take it back!”

The biggest liquor brand in China was the Yang family.

“Since it’s something that was given away, there’s no reason to take it back,”grandpa Yang continued, “I’ve already found a witness lawyer and the other procedures have been completed. Little Miracle Doctor Ye, you must accept this share.”

Grandpa Yang didn’t just say that he was giving away the shares.

After he said that, grandfather Yang continued, “Little Miracle Doctor Ye, don’t refuse to take care of the company. My current health is still pretty good. As long as I’m alive, there’s no need for you to worry about the matters in the company.”

Yang Danian was someone who couldn’t stand up.

Rather than waiting for him to die and the company that he worked hard for his entire life to be divided up by the other branches, it would be better to transfer 30% of the shares to ye Zao in his lifetime.

Although he gave away 30% of the shares, he still made a profit. At least 70% of the shares were still in Yang Danian’s hands.

Elder Yang trusted ye Zao’s character very much. She knew that ye Zao would not have any evil thoughts.

The other branches were different.

They were a bunch of ingrates who would not spit out their bones!

More importantly, elder Yang believed that ye Zao could bring the Yang Group to a whole new level.

However, Ye Zhuo refused to accept it, so grandfather Yang could only temporarily give up on this idea, he continued, “Little Miracle Doctor Ye, I feel that we are very compatible. It just so happens that I have a granddaughter that is about the same age as you. Why don’t the two of us get married and I’ll acknowledge you as my godgranddaughter? What do you think?”

Get Married?

It was not a bad thing to gain popularity.

After all, one more friend meant one more way out.

Ye Zhuo did not reject old master Yang’s suggestion. “As long as Grandpa Yang doesn’t dislike me.”

“Why would I dislike you!”Old Master Yang was very happy. “Then from now on, Little Miracle Doctor Ye, you will be my granddaughter!”

Taking ye Zhuo as their godgranddaughter was definitely a win for the Yang family.

Ye Zao was only so young, and her medical skills were already so good. She would definitely have greater achievements in the future. At that time, those who wanted to have some relations with her would probably be able to line up from here to the capital.

“Grandfather Yang, there’s no need to be so unfamiliar. You can just call me by my name in the future.”

“Then I’ll call you Zao Zao,”grandfather Yang said.

“En.”Ye Zao nodded slightly. “My family and friends all call me that.”

“Then I’ll Follow Your Grandpa Yang and bask in his glory. I’ll call you Zao Zao in the future,”old Mrs. Song said with a smile.

“It’s good that you like it, Grandma Song.”

I like it!

How could I not like it!

Which old man would not like such a beautiful girl with such good medical skills?

Old Mrs. Song wished that she could let ye Zao stay at the song family directly.

After the dinner, song Shiyu asked the driver to send ye Zao Home.

Watching the black car disappear into the night, song Shiyu looked at his assistant and said, “Go and find out what happened to the Mu family recently and why Miss Mu’s surname was ye before she turned eighteen.”
