“Ah!”

“Just as she opened the package, Zhao Xueyin screamed in fear and fell to the ground. “Throw it away! Take it out and throw it away immediately!” ”

“Seeing her like this, father Zhao frowned slightly and walked over to take a look. He was also shocked. ”

“In the package were a paper figurine, two wreaths, and a set of burial clothes worn by dead people. ”

“Zhao Xueyin’s name was written on the paper figurine’s head, and on its body, it said, “Go to hell!”! ”

Zhao Xueyin’s name was also written on the wreaths’couplets.

It was both unlucky and scary!

“”Miss, your express delivery!”A few more people came in with unopened express delivery. ”

It was obvious what these express delivery contained.

“Zhao Xueyin couldn’t help but step back, holding her head with both hands. “Throw it away! Take it out and throw it away!” ”

“Father Zhao then added, “If you receive the express delivery from Miss these two days, just throw it away!” ”

“Okay.”

The servants took the express delivery back.

Father Zhao looked at Zhao Xueyin who was sitting on the ground. He could not put on any expression on his face. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

He had never thought that Zhao Xueyin would end up like this.

She had made a move on a cat!

To think that she could think of such a thing!

“If she had attacked, she would have attacked! ”

But she had to do it in the office.

Didn’t she know that there were surveillance cameras in the office?

“If this wasn’t stupidity, then what was it? ”

“One could live with the sins of the heavens, but one could not live with the sins of one’s own hands. ”

This was all done by Zhao Xueyin herself.

“”Master, Miss!”The Butler rushed out from inside. “The consortium called. They said that they have an emergency meeting coming. They would like to invite you over.” ”

Emergency meeting?

“At this juncture, what emergency meeting could there be? ”

It must be about the cat abuse incident.

The cat abuse incident was very small.

But it could affect the reputation of the consortium.

Now was the era of technology. A small matter that was as small as a sesame seed would become a big matter under the ferment of public opinion!

Father Zhao frowned. “Got it.”

...

“An hour later, the Zhao family’s car appeared at the entrance of the Shunxi Financial Group. ”

Zhao Xueyin and Father Zhao got out of the car.

“The moment they opened the car door, they saw a crowd gathered at the entrance of the Financial Group. ”

There was even a long red banner.

The banner read: Cat Abusers go to hell!

Ye Zao.

It was definitely ye Zao again.

“Without a doubt, these people were definitely arranged by ye Zao. ”

Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes.

Father Zhao turned to look at the driver. “Get in the car! Let’s go around to the basement!”

“Okay.”The driver nodded and opened the door of the driver’s seat.

“Ten minutes later, the car appeared in the basement. ”

As expected.

The basement was very quiet. There were no people outside.

Father Zhao and Zhao Xueyin got out of the car and walked in the direction of the elevator.

Just as they reached the entrance of the elevator.

PA —

A bucket of black dog blood was splashed on the two of them just like that.

The thick stench of blood wafted out from the air.

“By the time Father Zhao and Zhao Xueyin reacted, the person who splashed the blood had already disappeared without a trace. ”

“”Call the police! Xiao Li, quickly call the police!” ”

Cat abuse was a small matter!

This was already a personal attack!

The law did not clearly state what kind of punishment cat abuse would receive.

But to splash dog blood on a person was a crime of malicious assault!

“Xiao Li said, “Okay.” ”

“In order to leave behind physical evidence, Father Zhao and Zhao Xueyin did not immediately go upstairs to change. Instead, they stayed where they were and waited for the police. ”

“The police arrived very quickly. After taking a statement, they continued, “Can you take a look at the surveillance footage of Your Consortium?” ”

“”Yes.”Father Zhao nodded. “Xiao Li, bring the two police officers to the surveillance room.” ”

“”Officers, this way please.”Xiao Li brought the officers to the monitoring room. ”

Father Zhao and Zhao Xueyin went upstairs to change.

Father Zhao had just come out of the bathroom when there was a knock on the door. “Master!”

It was Xiao Li’s voice.

“Father Zhao walked over to open the door. Other than Xiao Li, there were also the two police officers, “Mr. Zhao, the surveillance cameras in the basement are broken, so the two assailants were not captured. May I ask if you and Miss Zhao have seen what that person looks like?” ”
