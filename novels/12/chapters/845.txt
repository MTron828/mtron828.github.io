“Chapter 846: 185: Break your leg. If my granddaughter-in-law isn’t good, who is? 4”

Translator: 549690339

“Not yet.”Song Chenyu shook his head.

“Cen Yuyan continued, “I originally wanted to invite you to stay at our house, but who knew that my grandmother actually didn’t agree! She even said that she wanted to break my leg! Do you think she’s senile?””

“”Yuyan, you told your grandmother about this?”Song Chenyu’s face was full of surprise.”

“Yes.”Cen Yuyan nodded.

“Song Chenyu continued, “Yuyan, there’s actually no need to tell your grandmother about this. Even if your grandmother agrees, I Won’t stay at your house! Think about it. As a public figure, who doesn’t have a few illegitimate children? Don’t worry, I’m not that pretentious!””

“CEN Yuyan continued, “You’re my best friend. I’m helping you during your most difficult time.””

“Song Chenyu smiled and patted Cen Yuyan’s shoulder. “Yuyan, I appreciate your kindness.””

“Cen Yuyan hugged song Chenyu and said in a depressed voice, “But I just want you to stay at my place.””

A faint light flashed in song Chenyu’s eyes. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

She deliberately raised the issue of the illegitimate meal so that Cen Yuyan would take the initiative to invite her to stay at the Cen House.

The matter did indeed develop in the direction she had thought.

“After Cen Yuyan learned of this matter, she immediately brought it up with old Mrs. Cen.”

“However, what song Chenyu did not expect was that old Mrs. Cen actually refused.”

This was beyond song Chenyu’s expectations.

She originally thought that she could smoothly stay with the CEN family.

It seemed that old Mrs. Cen’s opinion of her was not just a little bit.

“Thinking of this, song Chenyu narrowed his eyes and suppressed the strange look in his eyes, he smiled and said, “Yuyan, I know that you treat me as your best friend and family. I treat you the same. “It’s quite good that I’m staying in a hotel now. Don’t blame your grandmother. The old lady has considered things more thoroughly. After all, I’m a public figure. If I’m not careful with my clothes, food, and accommodation, I’ll be exposed to the cameras. If I really stay at your house, I’ll definitely bring trouble to Your House.””

“”Chenyu, you’re just too optimistic.”Cen Yuyan looked at song Chenyu. “You like to think of everything in the best direction. Do you know that you’ll be bullied like this? !””

Song Chenyu smiled. “Don’t worry. No one will bully me.”

“After saying that, song chenyu continued, “I don’t have any plans tomorrow. Why Don’t we invite Lu Xiu and have a picnic in the countryside together?””

Cen Yuyan’s eyes lit up at the mention of Lu Xiu. “Sure!”

She had not seen Lu Xiu for a long time.

“Although she knew that Lu Xiu liked ye Zhuo, she still could not control herself.”

Lu Xiu liked song Chenyu to begin with.

“Song Chenyu had taken the initiative to ask him out. No matter how busy he was, he would always turn down the work at hand.”

“Early the next morning, Lu Xiu’s car stopped at the hotel where song Chenyu was staying.”

“Song Chenyu put on a mask and sunglasses and appeared downstairs with Cen Yuyan. When they saw Lu Xiu’s car, the two of them immediately walked over and sat in the car.”

“After getting in the car, song Chenyu said, “I want to rest in the backseat for a while. Why don’t Yuyan go to the passenger seat?””

“Cen Yuyan knew that song Chenyu was trying to set her and Lu Xiu up. She smiled and said, “No need. You can just rest your head on my leg.””

“”No, that’s not comfortable.”Song Chenyu continued, “You go to the co-pilot seat. Lu Xiu, you don’t mind if Yuyan sits in the co-pilot seat, right?””

“Lu Xiu was silent for a moment before he continued, “I don’t mind.””

Cen Yuyan half-pushed and half-pushed and went to the co-pilot seat.

This was her first time sitting in Lu Xiu’s co-pilot seat. It was also the first time she was so close to Lu Xiu. Her heart was racing and her face was extremely red.

“Song Chenyu lay in the back seat, the corners of her mouth curling up slightly.”

“To her, asking Lu Xiu out today was killing two birds with one stone.”

“Firstly, it could make CEN Yuyan even more grateful to her.”

“If it wasn’t for her, Cen Yuyan could have sat in Lu Xiu’s co-pilot seat.”

“Secondly, it could make Lu Xiu even more loyal to her.”

“Cen Yuyan wasn’t good at hiding her emotions, especially in front of the person she liked.”

“With Cen Yuyan chasing after her relentlessly, Lu Xiu was able to find out more about her.”

She would never pester Lu Xiu.

They arrived at their destination in a short while.

“Lu Xiu brought tents and picnic utensils. Cen Yuyan looked at song Chenyu and said, “Chenyu, if you haven’t rested well, you can rest in the car for a while. Lu Xiu and I will go set up the tent.””

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “I was just about to say that, but I didn’t expect you to say it in advance. Yuyan, you know me better than I do.””

“Cen Yuyan said, “Who asked us to be good sisters? Isn’t it normal for good sisters to have telepathic thoughts?””

“You’re right.”Song Chenyu nodded.

“Cen Yuyan looked at Lu Xiu. “Lu Xiu, let’s go install the tent?””

Lu Xiu did not say anything. He took the tent and walked to the side.

“Cen Yuyan immediately caught up to Lu Xiu. “Lu Xiu, wait for me.””

“Looking at the backs of the two, the smile on song Chenyu’s face became even wider.”

On the other side.

The Cen family.

Old Madam Cen brought ye Zhuo’s painting to the gallery and had it framed.

“The Old Master of the gallery was in his seventies this year. He had a long beard and looked up at Old Madam Cen. “Old Madam, May I know which famous artist your painting came from?””

“Old Mrs. Cen said humbly, “This painting was painted by my granddaughter-in-law. A child was just casually painting it for fun. I’m sorry for making a fool of myself.””

Was he just casually painting for fun?

“If he was just casually painting for fun, then what would it look like if he were to get serious?”

“The old master gulped and looked up at Old Mrs. Cen. He then asked, “Then are you selling this painting of yours?””
