Translator: 549690339

“Although ye Zhuo and Lin Ze had already prepared for ye Shu to be Aunt Lang’s daughter, they could not help but be surprised when they heard the results.”

“After all, they had never thought that ye Shu was not the biological daughter of Ye Dahai and his wife.”

“Elder Zhang held the paternity test results in his hands, so excited that his hands were trembling.”

Good.

This was really great.

They had finally found the real half-moon.

“Cao Wei was equally excited. “Elder Zhang, it’s the real half-moon! This is the real half-moon!””

“Once they found the real half-moon, Xi Muwen and Xi Weiyue, the father and daughter duo, would not be able to get their way!”

Aunt Lang would also return to the financial world!

“When that time came, the Shunxi Financial Group would not let the Zhao family monopolize everything!”

“”Yes!”Elder Zhang looked up at Ye Zhuo and Lin Ze. “Miss Ye, Mr. Lin, can you take me to see your mother now?””

Lin Ze and ye Zhuo looked at each other and nodded. “Yes. But we have to go back and tell my mother and the others about this first.”

“Okay.”

Ye Zhuo looked up at the doctor. “Can you give us a copy of the appraisal report?”

“”Sure.”The doctor nodded and continued, “Please wait here for a moment.””

“After a while, the doctor came out of the office and handed a copy of the paternity test to Ye Zhuo.”

“”Thank you.”Ye Zhuo took the paternity test and turned to look at Lin Ze. “Brother, let’s go back first!””

“Okay.”Lin Ze nodded. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The siblings greeted elder Zhang and Cao Wei before walking back.

At the Lin residence.

Ye Shu was resting at home today and was watering the flowers in the courtyard.

“The lilies in the courtyard were in full bloom. A gentle breeze blew over, bringing with it a faint floral fragrance. It smelled especially good.”

“Mom.”

“Ye Shu looked back slightly and saw ye Zhuo and Lin ze walking in from outside the courtyard. “Zhuo Zhuo, Ah Ze, why are the two of you back together?””

“Ye Zhuo asked, “Where’s My Dad?””

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “He’s still at the office and hasn’t returned yet!””

“Hearing this, Lin Ze immediately picked up his phone and called Lin Jincheng.”

“Very soon, the call was connected.”

“Lin Ze said, “Dad, hurry and come back now. We have something very important to tell you.””

“Ye Shu was stunned. She turned to look at Ye Zhuo and asked doubtfully, “Zhuo Zhuo, what important thing does your brother have to say that he specially called your dad?””

“Ye Zao turned to look at Ye Shu. “It’s something very important. When my father comes back, you’ll know what it is.””

“Ye Shu smiled helplessly. “What do you have to say when your father comes back? Why Don’t you invite your grandmother over too!”After all, they lived under the same roof, old Lady Lin was now completely repentant. If it was a family matter, Old Lady Lin also had the right to know.”

Ye Zhuo respected ye Shu’s opinion. “Sure. Then I’ll call Uncle First and ask him to come over.”

This kind of thing naturally could not be hidden from ye Sen.

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “I’ll call your uncle. You Go to your grandmother first.””

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and walked towards the west courtyard.

“After Lin Jincheng received Lin Ze’s call, he put down what he was doing and rushed home.”

Ye Sen was the same.

Ye Zao had just stepped into the west courtyard when he heard the sound of wooden fish being beaten and the strong scent of sandalwood.

“Auntie Wang Saw Ye Zao coming over and smiled. “Miss, you’re here! The old lady is inside! If she knew you were here, she would definitely be very happy!””

Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Auntie Wang.”

“Inside, Old Lady Lin immediately opened her eyes when she heard the sound and turned around to look outside.”

“The next second, as expected, she saw sister-in-law Wang walking in with Ye Zao.”

“Zao Zao!”

Old Lady Lin was very excited when she saw ye Zao. “Zao Zao is here!”

“”Grandma.”After not seeing her for half a year, Old Lady Lin seemed to have aged quite a bit.”

“Her body no longer had the mean aura from before. From this, she looked like a kind old man.”

“If she had not experienced it herself, no one would have believed that such a kind person would do such a thing.”

Old Lady Lin looked at Auntie Wang. “Hurry up and bring the peach cobbler and the Pan halberd from my room! It’s searing’s favorite!”

“Okay.”Auntie Wang immediately went back to her room to get dessert.

“Ye Zao said, “There’s no need to get busy. I’m here to talk to you about something.””

“”Zao Zao, go ahead!”Old Lady Lin said.”

“Ye Zao continued, “It’s about my mother’s background. My father and my uncle are almost home now. Shall I push you to the East Wing?””

Background?

Ye Shu’s background?

Could there be something wrong with Ye Shu’s background?
