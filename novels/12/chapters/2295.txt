“Elder bai smiled and said, “From the looks of it, Lin Ze is indeed a good young man.” ”

“”Of course.”Bai Jingshu held elder Bai’s hand. “But don’t worry, grandfather. He will definitely not let you down.” ”

“Elder bai continued, “People change. Jingshu, you can’t Lower Your guard against Lin Ze just because he saved you.” ”

“Elder Bai’s every word was good advice. Bai Jingshu listened to him carefully. “I understand, grandfather.” ”

Elder Bai patted Bai Jingshu’s hand. The servant beside him heard their conversation.

“This servant was related to Bai Yuanyuan’s servant. When she heard the news, she immediately contacted Bai Yuanyuan and told her about it. ”

“When she heard the news, Bai Yuanyuan was very excited. ”

“She grabbed the servant’s shoulder and asked, “Are you sure this is true?” ”

“The servant nodded. “Third miss, don’t worry. I heard these words with my own ears. There’s no mistake.” ”

“That’s great! That’s Great!”Bai Yuanyuan’s eyes were shining.

She wanted to immediately tell Bai Mo about this explosive news.

“Thinking so, she did it. Bai Yuanyuan immediately went to Bai Mo’s house and couldn’t help but shout, “Mo Mo, Mo Mo! Something Big has happened!” ”

“Bai Mo had been in a very bad mood these few days. She had been studying Manwen for a very long time, but Manwen had no reaction at all. ”

It couldn’t go on like this.

She didn’t have that much time to waste with Manwen.

“When she heard Bai Yuanyuan’s voice, she said impatiently, “What’s wrong? What happened? What are you shouting for?” ”

“When she saw Bai Mo like this, the excitement on Bai Yuanyuan’s face faded a little. She continued, “Momo, what’s wrong? Are You in a bad mood?” ”

“What’s the matter? Tell me quickly.”Bai Mo did not want to waste time with Bai Yuanyuan.

“It’s a big matter!”Bai Yuanyuan said.

“Bai Mo said, “Tell me.” ”

“Bai Yuanyuan knew that she couldn’t waste her breath on Bai Mo anymore, so she went straight to the point. “Bai Jingshu has found a boyfriend.” ”

“Really?”Bai Mo was a little interested when Bai Jingshu was mentioned.

“After all, Bai Jingshu was the biggest stumbling block in her relationship. ”

“Yes!”Bai Yuanyuan nodded. “It’s true!”

“At this moment, Bai Mo seemed to realize something. He narrowed his eyes and said, “Bai Jingshu’s boyfriend can’t Be Manwen, right?” ”

“Bai Mo subconsciously clenched his fists, and his knuckles were already slightly white. ”

“If Bai Jingshu really got together with Manwen, then what was she? ”

A joke?

Why did that B * Tch Bai Jingshu take all the advantages. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

And all she met were leftovers.

“However, when Ye Han proposed to introduce Bai Mo to someone, Bai Mo was very excited. After all, with Ye Han’s status and status, the person he was going to introduce would definitely not be too bad. ”

Who knew...

“Who knew that in the end, he would actually introduce her to Lin Ze. ”

Just thinking about that matter made Bai Mo very angry.

Ye Han was simply insulting her.

“”Of course not! What are you thinking about! How can someone like her be worthy of Manwen! In My Heart, besides you, no one else is worthy of Manwen!”One sentence.., both trampling on Bai Jingshu and flattering Bai Mo, Bai Mo’s face was filled with smiles when he heard that. ”

“Bai Yuanyuan was right. Apart from her, no one else was worthy of Manwen. ”

Who Was Bai Jingshu?

“Bai Mo asked, “Then who is Bai Jingshu’s boyfriend?” ”

“”You definitely won’t be able to guess this person!”Bai Yuanyuan looked very mysterious. “If you know who it is, you’ll definitely be shocked!” ”

“Bai Mo continued, “So you’re saying that I know this person?” ”

“”Of course!”Bai Yuanyuan nodded. “Not only do I know him, but I’m also a little familiar with him!” ”

“Hearing that, Bai Mo narrowed his eyes. ”

She knew a lot of people.

“What kind of boyfriend could Bai Jingshu find that could possibly give her a fright. Most importantly, he was a little familiar with the other party... ”

“The Zhou Family?”Bai Mo asked.

“Bai Mo had previously talked to the eldest son of the Zhou family. At that time, the two of them had already reached the stage of discussing marriage. However, they broke up later due to some reasons. Other than the Zhou family, no one else should be able to give her a fright. ”

“If it really was the Zhou family, then Bai Jingzhu’s luck was truly exceptional. ”

“Every time she met a man, it was always a top-notch good man. ”

“It’s not the Zhou family.”Bai Yuanyuan shook her head.

It’s not the Zhou family?

“Bai Mo was stunned. Other than the Zhou family, who else could it be? ”

“The Sun Family?”

Bai Yuanyuan shook her head.
