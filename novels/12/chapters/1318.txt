“”What if after looking at the examination paper, it proves that someone tampered with my examination paper?”Zheng Wanyin asked in return. ”

“The CEO said, “If that’s really the case, I’m willing to resign and apologize, and then restore your 3A grade. “If there are no problems with the examination paper, you will forever lose the qualification to enter the ABA, and it will also directly affect your descendants.” ”

“Zheng wanyin said, “Don’t worry, I will not regret it!” ”

“As for the CEO, he would just have to resign and apologize! ”

There was also ye Zao.

“Once the truth was revealed, Ye Zao would also lose the right to be the Chief Assessment Officer. ”

“Then, the assessment this time would be overturned and restarted. ”

“Have you thought about it?”The CEO asked.

“Yes.”Zheng Wanyin nodded firmly.

The CEO pressed his temples. “It will take two hours to make the report. You should think about it during these two hours.”

“”CEO, I have thought about it very clearly.” ”

“The CEO looked at Zheng Wanyin with a complicated gaze. “Alright, I got it. You can go out and wait.” ”

Zheng Wanyin bowed and walked out.

“When she walked out of the CEO’s office, Liu Jingjing immediately went up to her. “Wanyin!” ”

“Jingjing.”

“Liu Jingjing continued, “Wanyin, I heard from them that you only got 1a. Is that true?” ”

“It’s true.”Zheng Wanyin nodded.

“How could this be?”Liu Jingjing looked surprised.

“Zheng wanyin said, “Jingjing, do you think I wouldn’t get 1a?” ”

“”Of course!”Liu Jingjing nodded. “Even I got 2a. And that Bai Xiaosu, how could Bai Xiaosu get 3A? Could it be that they made a mistake?” ”

Zheng Wanyin nodded. “Someone switched the exam papers between Bai Xiaosu and me.”

“Oh my God!”Liu Jingjing covered his mouth in surprise. “How could this be!”

“Zheng wanyin said bitterly, “I didn’t expect it to be like this either. I thought this was a fair and fair competition... who knew...”at the end of her sentence, Zheng Wanyin’s eyes were red. ”

She was really sad.

“This feeling was the same as the feeling of being the first in the city in the college entrance examination, but then being replaced by someone else. ”

She was the first.

The Triple A.

“But now, all the glory had been snatched away by someone else. ”

“Liu Jingjing said angrily, “No wonder Bai Xiaosu got into the Triple A. it turned out that he used underhanded methods! This kind of person is really disgusting! Wanyin, what are you going to do now? You Can’t just let it go like this, right?” ”

“Zheng wanyin said, “I have already applied with the CEO to check the examination papers.” ”

“”That’s Good!”Liu Jingjing continued, “I believe that the chief executive will definitely give you justice!” ”

“Zheng wanyin sighed, “The chief executive is speaking up for Bai Xiaosu both in and out of his words. I’m worried. I’m worried that even if the examination papers are taken out, the chief executive will let me settle this matter peacefully.” ” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“At the end of her sentence, Zheng wanyin continued, “I used to think that being born wasn’t important. As long as one worked hard, it would be fine. Only now do I know that those without power and influence will never be able to defeat those with power and influence!” Another example was Bai Xiaosu. ”

“If it were not for power and influence, Ye Zhuo would not have become the main examiner of the ABA. ”

“If it were not for power and influence, Bai Xiaosu would not have succeeded in imitating her results. ”

“”This is too much! This is too much!”Liu Jingjing was so angry that he was red. She was a young woman with a good outlook and could not bear to see such a thing happen. If everyone cheated, then what was the use of working hard? ”

Couldn’t they just find connections to get to the top? !

This society needed justice!

How did the Great Qing dynasty fall?

It was all because of corruption and too many parasites!

“Liu Jing held Zheng Wanyin’s arm and continued, “Wanyin, when are you guys going to look at the assessment papers face to face?” ”

Zheng Wanyin wiped her tears. “The CEO said that we can look at them in two hours.”

“Liu Jingjing said, “Wanyin, you don’t have to be afraid. When the time comes, I’ll organize our entire team to support you. I don’t believe that the CEO would still be able to cover up for Bai Xiaosu in front of everyone! “Not only Bai Xiaosu, but also the examiners who will change your results. When that time comes, all of you will be out of Luck!” ”

“When she heard this, a glimmer flashed across Zheng Wanyin’s eyes and the corners of her mouth curled up. ”

It was fleeting.

It was good to have more people.

“With more people, even if the CEO wanted to protect ye Zhuo and Bai Xiaosu, he would not have the chance. ”

“Thinking of that scene, Zheng Wanyin felt much better. ”

She would be able to clear her name soon!
