Translator: 549690339

Minister Wang went straight to the point and told Xiao Lu about the matter.

Xiao Lu’s expression turned slightly ugly when she heard that.

Wasn’t saying that the propeller wasn’t up to standard questioning her working attitude?

“Xiao Lu didn’t want to join the aircraft carrier project team at that time, but there was no lack of people in other parts of the base, so she had no choice but to come here. ”

“After arriving here, she worked very seriously. She did not expect that not only did she not receive any praise, but it even made people question her working attitude, “Miss ye said it’s a problem that can’t be seen with the naked eye. Could it be that her eyes are machine-made and carry a scanner?”If it was really that powerful, why would they need the quality inspection department? ”

No wonder everyone said that the aircraft carrier project was a joke.

She saw that it was indeed so!

“Hearing that, minister Wang said angrily, “Xiao Lu, watch your attitude.” ”

Xiao Lu was a fresh graduate student. It was already hard enough for her to not find the right place to display her passion and ambition. It was even harder for her to be criticized!

“”Minister Wang, I can take anything, but I can’t stand being wronged.” ”

“Minister Wang continued, “Take the items to the quality inspection first. We’ll talk about other things later.” ”

“What if the items are found to be fine?”

“Cen Jiang stood up and said, “Then I’ll apologize to you personally.” ”

“Xiao Lu said, “There’s no need for an apology. I want to change my position.” ”

“”Sure.”Cen Jiang nodded and continued, “If there’s a problem after the inspection, you can hand in your resignation report yourself.” ”

There’s a problem?

There definitely won’t be a problem!

“Although Xiao Lu went to work emotionally, she was really serious about her work. ”

“The few of them placed the propellers on the quality inspection table, and the scanner scanned them one by one. ”

A total of 20 seconds.

“Seeing that 15 seconds had passed and the alarm still hadn’t sounded, Xiao Lu continued, “I already said that it’s not my problem. Team leader Cen, do you still remember the promise you made just now?” ”

Di Di —

“It was as if they had cooperated well. As soon as he said that, the sound of an alarm sounded in the air. ”

Cen Jiang’s voice was a little cold. “You call this not a problem?”

Xiao Lu’s face turned pale. “How could this be!”

“Cen Jiang turned to look at department leader Wang. “Old Wang, I’ll leave the rest to you.” ”

“After such a thing happened, old Wang couldn’t help but feel embarrassed. “Don’t worry, team leader Cen.” ”

Cen Jiang returned to the laboratory.

“Cen Hu immediately ran over and asked, “How was it? Did you go to the Quality Inspection Department?” ”

Cen Jiang nodded. “Miss Ye is really amazing! You could tell that there was something wrong even through the surveillance cameras! That Eye is like a scanner! It’s too poisonous.”

“At first, Cen Jiang was really afraid of causing a misunderstanding. ”

He didn’t expect that your father was still your father!

“Cen Hu said, “Of course. How can my goddess not be divine?” ”

Cen Jiang picked up his communicator and replied to Ye Zao.

...

“Early the next morning, ye Zao accompanied Ye Sen to the hospital for a follow-up check-up. ”

“Ye Sen was recovering very well. “Zao Zao, there’s no need to go through so much trouble. Didn’t you already check my pulse?” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Let’s go to the hospital. There are some problems that we need to do a CT scan to see more clearly.” ”

“Helpless, Ye Sen could only follow them to the hospital. ”

Sunday.

The hospital was filled with people.

Zheng Wanyin had just walked into the hospital hall when she saw ye Zao and Ye Sen walking over. She frowned slightly.

Why was ye Zao Here?

Could it be that he was here to apologize to Xie Wanqiu?

Yes.

It must be.

Why else would ye Zao come to the hospital?

This was beyond her expectations.

She had thought that ye Zao was a man of integrity and courage. She did not expect that ye Zao was only so-so.

In order to marry Cen Shaoqing.

Ye Zao was really patient.

Zheng Wanyin quickened her steps so that she could avoid ye Zao. She jogged all the way to Xie Wanqiu’s ward. Her tone was a little anxious. “Grandma.”

“What’s Wrong?”Xie wanqiu looked up. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Zheng wanyin continued, “Grandma, cousin-in-law came to apologize to you.” ”

“”See what I Said? It’s only the second day and she can’t hold it in anymore!”Xie wanqiu continued, “Go and stand guard outside the door and tell her that if she wants me to forgive her, she has to Kowtow to me three times First!” ”
