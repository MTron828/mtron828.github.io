“A layer of anger appeared in Old Mrs. Lin’s eyes. “We haven’t even met, and you already know that it’s inappropriate? Fourth brother, I’ve already apologized to you for Zhao Shuning’s matter. What more do you want me to do?” ”

Killing someone was just a nod of the head.

Could it be that Lin Qingxuan wanted to watch her mother die of guilt?

“Lin Qingxuan could not be bothered to say anything more to Old Madam Lin. “Mom, I know what I’m doing. You Don’t have to worry about me anymore! It’s getting late, I’ll go back to my room first.” ”

“After saying that, she turned around and left. ”

“Looking at Lin Qingxuan’s back, Old Madam Lin was furious. ”

She had thought that Lin Qingxuan was the most obedient son in the family.

She did not expect that even Lin Qingxuan had changed.

“Aunt Zhang narrowed her eyes and walked to Old Madam Lin’s side. “Old Madam, it seems that after ye Shu that woman entered the Lin family, everything in the family changed. Even your illness became serious.” ”

Aunt Zhang’s words woke her up from her dream.

Yes!

Aunt Zhang was absolutely right.

“In the past few days, her cough had indeed become more serious. ”

“Before ye Shu entered the Lin family, Lin Ze was a good grandson, Lin Jincheng was a filial son, and Lin Qingxuan and the other sons and daughters-in-law in the family were all very filial. ”

“Ever since ye Shu married into the family, everything had changed. ”

Even the obedient Lin Qingxuan had changed.

Ye Shu was simply a Jinx!

Old Lady Lin furrowed her brows tightly.

“Aunt Zhang continued, “If Miss Qianhua had successfully married into the family, there definitely wouldn’t have been so many things happening.” ”

Old Mrs. Lin was furious. “This jinx is here to harm our Lin family! Just you wait! I’ll kick her out for sure! She doesn’t deserve to be part of our Lin Family!”

Aunt Zhang looked at Old Mrs. Lin with a glimmer in her eyes.

“Old Mrs. Lin continued, “We’ll deal with these troublesome matters later. Xianxian awards ceremony is on Saturday. Help me prepare a set of clothes suitable for the awards ceremony.” ”

“As the first person in the Lin family to win a science and Technology Award, Old Mrs. Lin attached great importance to Feng Xianxian’s award ceremony. ”

“”Okay.”Aunt Zhang nodded, she smiled and said, “Xianxian is indeed the daughter of Miss Qianhua. Although she didn’t perform well in the college entrance examination, she won an award in the science and Technology Competition! I heard that not everyone can win a science and Technology Award!” ”

So what if Lin Ze was the top scorer in the college entrance exam?

The top scorer in the college entrance exam still lost to Feng Xianxian!

“Old Lady Lin smiled and said, “Although Xianxian is not of the Lin family’s bloodline, she still has the style of my youth.” ”

“”After all, she was raised by your side since she was young. It’s normal for her to be like you,”aunt Zhang echoed. ” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Old Lady Lin nodded.

...

Feng Xianxian had been preparing for the award ceremony for the past few days.

“After all, it was Dr. YC who had shocked the entire scientific and technological world personally presenting the award. She had to dress solemnly. It would be best if she could make Dr. YC’s eyes light up and notice her immediately. ”

“If she wanted to gain a foothold in the scientific and technological world, she had to rely on her ability and connections. ”

“If she could make Dr. YC see her in a different light, it would be a supreme honor. ”

Those who could become professors were definitely not young.

Feng Xianxian’s greatest trait was that she was good at pleasing the elderly.

“The elderly did not like girls who wore heavy makeup, so she prepared to put on nude makeup. ”

“After putting on makeup, Feng Xianxian turned to look at Bai Xiaoman beside her. “What do you think about me putting on this makeup and going onstage to receive the award?” ”

“”It looks good, it looks good!”Bai Xiaoman was extremely envious of Feng Xianxian. “Xianxian, you’re really amazing! I heard that our school has a total of over 2,000 people participating, but you actually managed to get third place!” ”

“A hint of pride flashed across Feng Xianxian’s eyes before disappearing. “It’s alright. I wasn’t feeling well on the day of the competition. Otherwise, I shouldn’t have any problems getting first place.” ”

“Speaking up to this point, Feng Xianxian’s gaze swept past ye Zao. ”

Ye Zao must be very envious of her right now!

Third place in the science competition!

She could even shake hands with Dr. YC.

Ye Zao would probably never be able to reach her level in this lifetime.

“Thinking of this, Feng Xianxian’s heart was filled with a sense of superiority! ”

“When she said this, Bai Xiaoman was even more envious. “Xianxian, how did your brain grow? ! You’re too smart! Unlike some people who don’t even have the qualifications to register for the competition!” ”

These words were meant for Ye Zao.

Unfortunately.

Ye Zhuo completely ignored her.

“Feng xianxian continued, “Oh right, Xiaoman, do you want to participate in the award ceremony?” ”

“”Yes! Of course I want to!”Bai Xiaoman hurriedly nodded. “Unfortunately, to participate in the award ceremony, you need a ticket! Otherwise, I would definitely join in the fun.” ”
