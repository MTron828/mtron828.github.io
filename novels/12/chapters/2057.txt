Translator: 549690339

“”What should we do now?”Zhao Dan’s eyes were slightly red. “All these years, I haven’t been able to let go of her. In the end, it’s all our fault. I...” ”

“You what? !”Man Jiangshan interrupted Zhao Dan. “Our Full Moon died long ago! This person has nothing to do with us!”

“But...”

“”Shut up!”Man Jiangshan frowned, “I’m asking you what do you mean now? Do you want to see our country fall? ! Xing ‘er has just stabilized her feet. I’m asking you, what do you want to Do? Do you want to make Xing ‘er sad?”? ”

“Zhao Dan didn’t say anything more, but his eyes were red. ”

“First of all, she was a mother. ”

“Second, she was the mother of the country. ”

“On the day their eldest daughter was born, there was a natural phenomenon. All the plants within a radius of tens of miles died. In the following year, Manxing encountered an unprecedented natural disaster. ”

“At this moment, a feng shui master stood out and divined the full moon. ”

The result of the divination was...

“The full moon would not only harm the father, mother, and sister, but it would also bring about the destruction of the nation. ”

“Man Jiangshan and Zhao Dan naturally did not believe that this was their biological daughter. One day, the full moon mysteriously disappeared. ”

“On the third day of the Full Moon’s disappearance, the disaster situation in Manxing country lessened. Later on, it gradually returned to normal and the country was peaceful. ”

“River, clear sea, Yan. ”

“In the second year of the Full Moon’s disappearance, man Jiangshan and Zhao Dan’s second daughter, Manlian City, was born. Different from the full moon, Manlian City was like a blessed star, bringing infinite good fortune to Manxing country. ”

“Later, man Jiangshan changed his second daughter’s name from man Liancheng to man Xing. ”

“Therefore, man Xing became the couple’s favorite daughter. ”

“Actually, from the name man Xing, it could be seen how much the man Jiangshan couple loved their daughter. ”

“Man Xing, man Xing kingdom, it was obvious that they would inherit the throne from man Jiangshan in the future. ”

“Man Jiangshan looked at Zhao Dan and said, “Be careful. Don’t let anyone notice anything unusual. The Full Moon died a long time ago! Xing ‘er is our only daughter now!” ”

“Zhao Dan’s eyes were red and her voice was a little hoarse, “Jiangshan, I don’t have anyone by my side. Is there anything that we, husband and wife, can not talk about? It has been so many years. Have you never thought about the full moon? When she left us, she was so young, she couldn’t speak... . .” ”

He was a little over a year old when the full moon went missing.

“As a mother, she dreams of finding her daughter. ”

“The whole country sighed, “Zhao Dan, you think I don’t feel bad? You think I don’t want to find our daughter! But she’s dead! In a place like the eternal glacier, not even an adult can survive, let alone a child!” ”

“At this point, man Jiangshan’s tone softened a little, “Don’t think so much. Ye Zhuo is ye Zhuo. She has nothing to do with us or Xing ‘er! Or do you want to ruin Xing ‘Er’s political career? Don’t forget what master Cao Said!” ”

The upper part detested the parents and the lower part detested the younger siblings.

“Hearing this, Zhao Dan immediately stopped crying. He wiped his tears and continued, “I understand.” ”

Master Cao had also divined for Manxing.

“Manxing had a Phoenix’s life. In the future, not only would she take over Manxing, she would even have higher achievements. ”

“As a mother, Zhao Dan naturally could not drag down her youngest daughter. ”

“After all, she had already lost a daughter. ”

“She could not let her daughter get hurt again. For the rest of her life, she would protect Manxing well. ”

“”It’s good that you know,”manjiangshan continued, “If there’s nothing else on the other side, you should come back as soon as possible so that people won’t notice anything.” ”

“Okay.”Zhao Dan nodded. “I got it.”

“After cutting off the connection, Zhao Dan felt a little better. ”

“On the other side, man Jiangshan lit a cigarette and sat on the chair, puffing out smoke. ”

He was alive.

“After nineteen years, why was the full moon, who had already been confirmed dead, alive again? ”

That wasn’t right.

It definitely wasn’t right. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Then it definitely wasn’t the full moon.

Dong Dong Dong —

“At this moment, there was a knock on the door. ”

“Come in.”

Man Jiangshan also put out his cigarette in the Ashtray.

“Mr. President.”

“Master Cao.”Man Jiangshan stood up from his chair. “Please take a seat.”

It was none other than the person who had divined the full moon nineteen years ago.

“Ever since the full moon went missing, Manxing country had been getting better and better. From this, man Jiangshan concluded that master Cao was indeed powerful and kept master Cao by his side. ”

“The corners of master Cao’s mouth curled up into a smile. “I observed the weather at night and discovered that something had changed on the Phoenix Throne Star, so I gave the Princess of the Manxing kingdom a divination.” ”
