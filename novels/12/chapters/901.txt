Ointment?

Song Shiyu would never use such a useless ointment.

Ye Zhuo was really shameless.

He actually used the excuse of delivering the ointment to approach song Shiyu.

Did he really think that song Shiyu would spare her a second glance?

“Song Chenyu was just about to reject when a slender arm came over from behind song Chenyu and took the ointment from ye Zhuo. His voice was slightly lowered as he said, “Thank you.” ”

Song Chenyu raised his head and looked at song Shiyu in disbelief.

She thought that song Shiyu would directly ignore ye Zao.

She did not expect that song Shiyu would actually accept it.

“Don’t say that.”Ye Zao’s red lips parted slightly. “The injury on your face was caused by me. I should be responsible for it.”

“Song Shiyu smiled and said, “My skin is rough and my flesh is thick. Actually, it’s nothing. I’ll be fine after one night.” ”

“”Even though my skin is rough and my flesh is thick, I still need to apply the ointment that needs to be applied,”ye Zao said in a shallow voice. “This ointment is applied every two hours. The effect is very good.” ”

“Okay.”Song Shiyu nodded slightly.

“Ye Zao continued, “If there’s nothing else, I’ll go back first.” ”

“Okay.”

“Song Chenyu looked at Ye Zao’s back and narrowed his eyes. He then looked up at song Shiyu and said, “Third brother, I see that you and Miss ye seem to be very familiar with each other?” ”

“”Not really,”song Shiyu said concisely. After saying this, he walked into the house. ”

“Upon hearing this answer, song Chenyu inexplicably heaved a sigh of relief. ”

“This meant that in song Shiyu’s eyes, Ye Zao was not any different from other women. ”

Ye Zao returned to the kitchen.

“Yin Wei was peeling chestnuts while waving at ye Zao. “Yezi, the chestnuts are already ripe.” ”

“Are they good?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“They’re good.”Yin Wei hurriedly nodded. “They’re soft and sticky! Try One!”

Ye Zhuo took the chestnuts that Yin Wei handed over.

The taste was indeed not bad.

“The texture was not only soft and sticky, but also especially sweet. ”

“In order to maintain his figure, Yin Wei did not dare to eat another one. ”

Ye Zhuo ate five or six in a row.

“Yin Wei looked at ye Zhuo enviously. “Ye, you said that you eat more than me every day and drink more than me. Why Can’t you gain weight?” ”

“Ye Zhuo looked back slightly and smiled. “If you wake up at 5:30 tomorrow morning to run with me, you won’t gain weight.” ”

Yin Wei shook her head. “I can’t get up at 5:30 am.”She would rather eat less than get up so early.

“Ye Zhuo scooped the chestnuts out of the pot and asked Yin Wei to send them to Wei Xingzhi and Chang Yu for a taste. Then, he gave some to the program team staff. ”

“Although they were recording the program, Ye Zhuo always made more when she was cooking. Therefore, the staff had a good impression of her. ”

...

In song Chenyu’s lounge.

“”Third brother, when are you going back to the East continent this time?” ”

“”The weather in the east continent is good, and the scenery is also not bad. It’s not easy for you to come here, so you must play for a few more days! Our program is about to end, and I’ll bring you around when the time comes!” ”

“...”

“Song Shiyu just sat there with his lips slightly pursed. Song Chenyu asked five or six questions in a row, but he did not answer any of them. His beautiful face seemed to be covered in a layer of mist, making it impossible for others to see his true thoughts, there was not even a hint of expression. ”

It was like a statue that could breathe.

“Although song Shiyu did not answer her, song Chenyu did not mind at all. ”

It was because she understood song Shiyu.

“Song Shiyu was such a person. When he did not want to talk, no matter how much the other party said, he could not be bothered to say a single word. ”

“Only she could talk so much to song Shiyu. If it were anyone else, they would not even have the right to stand in front of Song Shiyu. ”

“She had been filming for so many years, and this was the first time song Shiyu had come to the set to see her. ”

This also meant that her position in song Shiyu’s heart was getting higher and higher.

“At this moment, Song Shiyu suddenly raised his eyes and looked at song Chenyu. “You can go out first.” ”

“Song Chenyu was stunned at first, then he smiled and said, “Alright, third brother, take a good rest first. I Won’t disturb you anymore.” ”

“Okay.”

Song Shiyu turned around and walked out.

“”Close the door,”song Shiyu’s voice was heard. ”

Song Shiyu closed the door.

“Looking at the closed door, song Shiyu pinched his temples. There was a hint of fatigue between his brows. Then, he picked up the ointment on the table and smeared it on his face bit by bit. ”

“In a moment, song Shiyu seemed to have suddenly thought of something. He picked up a tissue and wiped off all the ointment on his face. ”

“Looking at himself in the mirror, song Shiyu’s lips curled into a faint smile. He raised his hand and drew the shape of the bruises on his face bit by bit. ”
