“Chapter 1195: 256: Si Lui suddenly came to his senses! Face slapping, Lord Fifth’s vest dropped all over the floor! 4”

Right.

It was definitely just a show.

“Thinking of this, Si Lui’s eyes lit up again. “I’ve been a little tired recently.” ”

“Zhao Xueyin continued, “Then you should pay more attention to rest.” ”

“”Okay.”Si lui nodded. “Xueyin, you should also pay attention to rest.” ”

“Zhao Xueyin smiled and said, “Don’t worry, I’m not a child anymore.” ”

“Speaking up to this point, Zhao Xueyin paused and continued, “By the way, Big Brother Si, are you free to get off work tonight?” ”

“I’m free.”Si lui nodded.

“Zhao Xueyin continued, “Then let’s go for a meal together?” ”

“Okay.”

“Then it’s settled. I’ll go back to the office first.”

“Okay.”

The lawyer watched Zhao Xueyin get into the private elevator.

“From the beginning to the end, Zhao Xueyin had never said anything about firing him, so he must have misunderstood Zhao Xueyin. ”

“If Zhao Xueyin really didn’t have him in her heart, she wouldn’t have asked him out for dinner tonight. ”

“Thinking of this, the lawyer felt much better. ”

“Soon, it was time to get off work. ”

Si lui went to the restaurant in advance to wait for Zhao Xueyin.

He even bought a diamond ring and flowers.

“After today’s incident, Si lui was a little flustered. ”

He had to propose to Zhao Xueyin.

He couldn’t wait like this any longer.

“As time passed, Zhao Xueyin finally arrived late. “I’m sorry, Brother Si, the traffic was too heavy!” ”

“It’s okay.”Si lui handed Zhao Xueyin the tablet that he ordered. “I ordered these dishes. Do you want to add anything?”

“”No need.”Zhao xueyin smiled and said, “I like what you ordered.” ”

Si lui turned to look at the waiter. “Then these will do.”

“The waiter took the tablet with both hands. “Okay, please wait a moment.” ”

“Okay.”Si lui nodded.

Zhao Xueyin was still the same as before.

Si Lui’s heart slowly calmed down.

He should have trusted Zhao Xueyin. He should not have let his imagination run wild.

“Halfway through the meal, Zhao Xueyin put down her chopsticks and looked up at Si lui. “Big Brother Si, I have something to tell you.” ”

“Si lui smiled and said, “What a coincidence. I have something to tell you too.” ” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Zhao Xueyin said, “Then you go first.” ”

“”You go first,”Si lui said. ”

Could it be that Zhao Xueyin wanted to use this opportunity to chase him out of the Shunxi Financial Group?

No.

It wouldn’t be.

He had to believe Zhao Xueyin.

Zhao Xueyin was definitely not that kind of person.

“Si lui took a deep breath, and his heart was in his throat. ”

He had loved Zhao Xueyin for so many years.

He didn’t want to end up falling in love with a joke.

He didn’t want to embarrass himself even more.

“Zhao xueyin nodded and continued, “Big Brother Si, you’re a very talented person. This time, for me, you’ve been demoted four levels consecutively. I’m really sorry...” ”

It turned out that Zhao Xueyin did not want to chase him away.

Zhao Xueyin was concerned about him.

“Si lui heaved a sigh of relief and said with a smile, “It’s alright. I volunteered for all of this. I Don’t blame you.” ”

“Zhao Xueyin sighed, “Big Brother Si, although you don’t blame me, I can’t bear it in my heart. If it wasn’t for me, you wouldn’t have been so wronged! This is all my fault. Big Brother Si, I’ve let you down...”Zhao Xueyin blamed herself endlessly, there wasn’t any flaw on her face. ”

Even the lawyer was convinced.

“The lawyer reached out and held Zhao Xueyin’s hand. “Xueyin, I’m really fine. Don’t think that way. I’ve never thought that this is anything! As long as you’re fine, I’m willing to do whatever you want me to do.” ”

“Looking at the hand held by the lawyer, Zhao Xueyin felt a little disgusted. ”

But she couldn’t say it out loud.

She could only endure it.

Si lui was still useful to her.

She couldn’t offend Si lui to death.

“Zhao Xueyin said with red eyes, “Big Brother Si, I don’t deserve you to be so good to me!” ”

“”Yes, you deserve it!”Si Lui’s tone was firm. ”

“Zhao Xueyin continued, “Big Brother Si, you are so talented. If you continue to stay on the 30th floor, you are simply wasting your talents. I Can’t bear to see you suffer such grievances. Why Don’t you resign? “If you leave the Shunxi Financial Group, with your talent, no matter which financial group you go to, you’ll be promoted to the position of chairman and above? “Why do you continue to stay in the Shunxi Financial Group and Waste Your Youth?” ”

Resign?

“To put it nicely, she was resigning. ”

“In fact, Zhao Xueyin was chasing her away. ”

“If the lawyer hadn’t heard the conversation between Zhao Xueyin and special assistant Li This Morning, he would have thought that Zhao Xueyin was sincerely doing him a favor. ”

Zhao Xueyin could not bear to see him suffer.

But now.

The lawyer only felt that the person in front of him was so unfamiliar that it made his heart turn cold.

“The lawyer smiled. “Xueyin, are you really doing me a favor?” ”

“”Of course!”Zhao Xueyin continued, “Brother Si, do you want to continue staying on the 30th floor?” ”
