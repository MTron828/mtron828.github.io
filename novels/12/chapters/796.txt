Translator: 549690339

“At this moment, Old Lady Lin couldn’t believe her ears. ”

How could this be?

“She treated Feng Xianxian as her granddaughter, and Feng Xianxian treated her as her grandmother. ”

No.

It wouldn’t happen.

Feng Xianxian wouldn’t harm her.

“Old Lady Lin tried her best to calm herself down. She turned around and squatted down in front of the trash can. This trash can was very big. When Old Lady Lin squatted down, her figure was coincidentally blocked by the trash can. ” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“At this moment, Feng Xianxian continued, “Miss Gao, are you sure the medicine is okay?” ”

“Then why is that old lady still fine?”

“”Okay, I understand.” ”

“After saying this, Feng Xianxian hung up the phone and looked around. Finally, she walked towards the door of the apartment. ”

“After Feng Xianxian left, Old Lady Lin walked out from behind the trash can. ”

Beijing in May.

“The weather had gradually warmed up, but old Mrs. Lin felt cold all over. ”

Was the old woman Feng Xianxian was talking about her?

Would she poison herself?

“If Feng Xianxian really poisoned her, then why was she still fine? ”

A misunderstanding.

This must be a misunderstanding.

“She was so good to Feng Xianxian, Feng Xianxian would not poison her! ”

Feng Xianxian was a filial and good child.

There must be a misunderstanding!

Old Lady Lin tried her best to calm herself down.

After a long while.

Old Lady Lin finally came to her senses and walked out of the apartment.

She still had to go to Beijing University to look for Lin Ze.

“She had raised Lin ze up with all her might, and Lin Ze had to take care of her! ”

...

On the other side.

“Ye Zhuo stood on the balcony of the dormitory and answered the phone. Her eyes were clear and bright, and the sunlight shone through the clouds, coating her body with a faint layer of golden light, giving people a sense of peace and tranquility. ”

“Wang Shuya’s voice came from the other end of the screen. “Goddess, Feng Qianxian has already made her move.” ”

“So Fast?”Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly.

“Although he had long known that Feng Qianxian would make her move on Old Lady Lin, ye Zao did not expect that Feng Qianxian would make her move so quickly. ”

“Wang Shuya continued, “Just now, Feng Qianxian called to ask why Old Lady Lin hasn’t had an attack until now. Goddess, is there a problem with that medicine?” ”

“”There’s no problem with the medicine,”ye Zhuo said plainly. “It’s just that it hasn’t taken effect yet.” ”

“That’s good.”

Madam Lin came to Beijing University and waited for Lin Ze Downstairs.

Lin Ze came downstairs.

“Grandma.”

“Madam Lin looked at Lin Ze with a layer of anger in her eyes. “Grandma? Lin Ze, do you still see me as your grandma?” ”

“You will always be my grandmother.”Lin Ze’s tone was very calm.

“Hearing this, the anger in Old Mrs. Lin’s eyes disappeared a little, she continued, “It’s good that you know that I’m your grandmother. Xianxian is a good child. She grew up with you. The two of you are like siblings. Although Feng Qianhua did something wrong, it was Feng Qianhua’s doing after all. It has nothing to do with Xianxian! “Grandmother hopes that you can treat Xianxian as your biological sister in the future.” ”

Even though she heard Feng Xianxian’s words.

Old Madam Lin still felt that Feng Xianxian was not that kind of person.

“She and Feng Xianxian were not grandfather and grandson, but they were close. Feng Xianxian definitely would not poison her. ”

Lin Ze’s eyes were a little cold. “I only have one sister. She is Ye Zhuo. Feng Xianxian doesn’t even have the right to carry my sister’s shoes. What right does she have to be my sister?”

“”Ah Ze! Do you still have me in your eyes as a grandmother?”Old Lady Lin frowned and said angrily, “Ye Zao doesn’t even recognize me as a grandmother anymore. In the future, she won’t be your sister! Xianxian is your only sister!” ”

“In Old Lady Lin’s eyes, Feng Xianxian was the most outstanding person in the world. ”

Ye Zao?

Ye Zao wasn’t even half as good as her!

“Hearing Lin ze say that about Feng Qianxian, Madam Lin was so angry that her face turned white. ”

“”Have you ever thought about why Zao doesn’t acknowledge you as a grandmother?”Lin Ze looked at Madam Lin, “Feng Qianhua is not a good person. What kind of good daughter do you think she will raise? Grandmother, please wake up. It’s all Feng Qianhua and Feng Qianxian’s fault that our family has become like this!” ”

“”What does this have to do with Xianxian?”Old Mrs. Lin was furious. “If you really want to pursue the responsibility, it should be your mother’s fault! Ever since she came back, the both of you have changed!” ”

“After that, old Mrs. Lin continued, “Lin ze, if you still treat me as your grandma, move out of that house immediately! Cut off relations with your parents!” ”
