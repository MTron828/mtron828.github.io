“”We’re all family! Qianhua, why are you being so polite with me?”Old Lady Lin patted Feng Qianhua’s hand, “Master Yu isn’t an ordinary person. His apprenticeship banquet will definitely be quite grand. Go back and get qianxian to make more preparations. When Master Yu comes back from Yunjing, he might have to prepare for the apprenticeship banquet!” ”

“”Alright, Aunt Lin.”Feng Qianhua nodded. ”

“After coming out of Old Lady Lin’s room, Feng Qianhua hurriedly told Feng Xianxian the good news. ”

“Hearing this, Feng Xianxian was equally excited. ”

“Although she was already prepared and master Yu would definitely take her in as a disciple, she was still extremely excited. ”

This was master Yu!

“As long as she performed well, she could even inherit master Yu’s mantle! ”

Feng Xianxian was very confident in herself!

...

“On the other side, in Yunjing. ”

“Because these two words had originally come from Bai Huaijin, master Yu went straight to the Bai family. ”

“When he learned that Master Yu was coming, Bai Huaijin was very surprised. ”

One had to know that master Yu was a famous person in the literary world. He was an unattainable existence.

Why did Master Yu suddenly visit?

Bai Huaijin received master Yu with a perturbed heart.

“”Master Yu, I’ve heard so much about you!” ”

“”Thank you for your kind words, Mr. Bai.” ”

Bai huaijin welcomed master Yu in from outside.

“When they reached the main hall, Bai Huaijin immediately instructed the servants to pour tea. ”

“Master Yu continued, “Mr. Bai, actually, I came here today because I have something to discuss with you.” ”

“Hearing this, Bai Huaijin immediately put down his teacup and said very solemnly, “Please speak, master Yu.” ”

Master Yu’s assistant took out the calligraphy piece.

“”Mr. Bai, do you recognize these two calligraphy pieces?” ” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Bai huaijin recognized these two calligraphy pieces at a glance. “I do! I gave them to my father not long ago!”

“Master Yu continued, “Mr. Bai, to tell you the truth, I really admire the author of these two calligraphy pieces. I wonder if Mr. Bai can tell me who is the author of these two calligraphy pieces?” ”

“Bai Huaijin was very happy that ye Zhuo’s words could be appreciated by master Yu. He continued, “The author of these two characters is a young lady named Ye Zhuo.” ”

Ye Zhuo?

Master Yu was stunned.

“The Ye Zhuo that Bai Huaijin was talking about, was it the Ye Zhuo that he knew? ”

“Master Yu continued, “Mr. Bai, can you tell me where this Young Lady Ye is from? Where does she live now?” ”

“Bai huaijin said, “Miss Ye is from Yun Jing, but she was admitted to the capital city to study at a university. She should be in the capital city now.” ”

She’s also in the capital city?

Could it really be the same person?

“Master Yu continued, “Mr. Bai, may I ask if this miss ye was the daughter of the Mu family in Yun Jing who had carried her by mistake for eighteen years?” ”

“As such, master Yu didn’t know much about Ye Zhuo. ”

“He only knew that before she was found by the Lin family, she had been carried by the MU family. ”

“Hearing this, Bai Huaijin nodded excitedly. “Yes! That’s right! It’s Miss Ye! Master Yu, do you know Miss Ye as well?” ”

He did not expect it to be true!

Master Yu was also very excited now.

“No wonder when he looked at the prescription ye Zhuo had prescribed, he had a familiar feeling! ”

“Master Yu said, “I do know her! But before this, I didn’t know that the author of these two characters was her!” ”

This result was too surprising for Master Yu!

But it was also within reason.

It was indeed very difficult to find a young lady as outstanding as ye Zao in this world.

“After learning of this news, master Yu rushed back to the capital city and asked ye Zao out alone. ”

“”Grandpa Yu, why did you ask me out today?” ”

Master Yu nodded. “There is indeed something I need to discuss with you.”

“Please speak.”

“Master Yu considered his words in his heart and continued, “Zhuozhuo, do you have any plans to join the literary world?” ”

Ye Zhuo shook his head slightly. “Not at the moment.”

“Not at the moment did not mean that he would not have one in the future. Master Yu continued, “Zhuozhuo, I have only taken in one disciple in my life. I wonder if I have the honor to take you in as my last disciple?” ”

Master Yu now had the intention of grooming ye Zhonghua to become the successor of the literary world in the future.

“With ye Zhonghua’s talent, she was definitely qualified! ”

“Ah?”Ye Zhonghua was stunned. “Why?”

Master Yu didn’t hide anything and directly took out the two words. “Because of these two words.”

Ye Zhonghua didn’t expect that the two words she had given at the Yun Jing banquet would end up in master Yu’s hands. “I remember giving these two words to Mr. Bai at that time.”

“Master Yu nodded, “That is indeed the case. When that Brat from the Bai family received these two words, he gave them to his father. Because his father had a favor to ask of him, he reluctantly gave them to someone else. In the end, someone else gave them to me! “Ye Zhuo, to tell you the truth, when I saw these two words, I felt like I saw hope in the literary world!” ”
