The air suddenly became quiet.

“Zhu Zheng looked at the three books on the table, and it took him a long time to react. ”

He didn’t expect that such a young girl

Actually had all three certificates.

This was too incredible.

“After all, he had taken the medical certificate exam for more than three years. ”

How Old was this girl?

Could these certificates be fake?

Zhu Zheng picked up a certificate and looked at it carefully.

Ye Zhuo.

Female.

Nineteen years old.

“As an old doctor with twelve years of medical experience, Zhu Zheng could naturally tell that these certificates were not fake. ”

These certificates were all real!

“Then, did she really have the ability to cure lung cancer? ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Doctor Zhu, don’t worry. I’m not joking with you. I can assure you that I can definitely cure my classmate! These three certificates are enough to prove that I’m not lying.” ”

Zhu Zheng was still a little hesitant.

This was a human life.

“If anything were to happen with the hospital’s cooperation, who would bear the consequences? ”

“In all these years, there had been quite a number of incidents involving doctors? ”

“At this moment, Zhao Pingting walked in from outside, “Doctor Zhu, if you’re afraid that something will go wrong and we’ll cause trouble for the hospital, I can write a disclaimer. I guarantee that no matter what happens, it has nothing to do with Your Hospital!” ”

“Father Zhao nodded. “My Daughter is right. If you’re afraid that a child’s words won’t work, our entire family can write a disclaimer for the hospital.” ”

“With the disclaimer, the hospital did not have to worry about the follow-up problems. ”

Zhu Zheng turned to look at Ye Zhuo. “How do you want our hospital to cooperate with you?”

“Ye Zhuo said, “I’ll have to trouble you to call three doctors from the oncology department to give me the right to use a sterile operating theater.” ”

“Zhu Zheng hesitated for a moment before he continued, “I’ll have to ask the hospital director about this.” ”

Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Then I’ll have to trouble you. I’ll wait for Your Good News.”

Zhu Zheng nodded.

“When the hospital director heard about this, he felt that it was a little strange. ”

Curing cancer?

“The medical world had been working hard for so many years, but they had yet to find any effective method. ”

A little girl could be cured just because she said she could?

This sounded like a daydream.

“Zhu Zheng calmly analyzed to the director, “Director, the patient’s family said that they are willing to write a waiver for us. Anyway, we only need to assign a few doctors to her. When that time comes, even if something goes wrong, we will not be able to find the responsibility of our hospital.” ”

“”Think about it. If a 19-year-old girl really does not have any ability, will she obtain the Doctor’s certificate, Pharmacist’s certificate, and Chinese Medicine Doctor’s Certificate?” ”

“”With these certificates, it means that she is the same as US and is a professional. This is not illegal practice of medicine, so there is no need to worry at all.” ”

The president frowned.

He was still thinking.

“As the president of the first People’s Hospital, he had to think carefully. If he was not careful, it would be a disaster for the entire hospital. ”

“Zhu Zheng continued, “Currently, no one in the world or even the entire world can cure cancer. If she really succeeds, our hospital will become the first hospital in the world that can cure cancer! When that time comes, our hospital will no longer be Yun Jing’s number one people’s Hospital, but China’s number one people’s Hospital! “Since ye Zao is confident that he can cure cancer and is willing to teach us the method to cure cancer, he won’t let us take responsibility even if something goes wrong. This is simply killing two birds with one stone!” ”

“Once he succeeded, Yun Jing’s number one people’s hospital would become famous throughout the world! ”

Perhaps no one would be able to resist such an allure.

“Upon hearing this, the hospital director raised his head to look at Zhu Zheng. “Where is that young lady surnamed ye Now? Bring me to meet her.” ”

“Alright.”Zhu Zheng nodded. “Follow me.”

Zhu Zheng brought the hospital director to Zhao Pingting’s ward.

“”Miss Ye, this is our hospital director Zhou.” ”

“When he saw ye Zhuo, a look of surprise flashed across hospital director Zhou’s eyes. He immediately understood why this young lady was able to have all three of the three syndromes at such a young age. ”

She had a very unique aura about her.

She was noble and elegant.

“She was like a green bamboo that stood proudly in the mountains and forests, causing people to involuntarily raise their heads and look up at her. ”

“Even he, who had been the hospital director for many years, felt that his footsteps were weak when he stood in front of her. ” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“”Hello, Miss Ye.”Hospital director Zhou hurriedly extended his hand to ye Zhuo. ”

“Ye Zhuo extended his hand to shake hospital director Zhou’s hand. “Hello, hospital director Zhou.” ”

“Hospital director Zhou looked at the people in the ward. “Miss Ye, can we have a word?” ”
