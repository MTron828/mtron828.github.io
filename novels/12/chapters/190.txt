Chapter 191: 088: Big Brother Zao is online, I’ve finally found her! 4

Beep!

Just as he finished a task, he received an invitation to add him as a friend.

ID: Warne.

Seeing that the number of friends had not reached the limit, ye Zao clicked agree.

On the other side.

In a laboratory.

“Agreed! NIU Hulu really agreed!”A middle-aged man wearing a radiation-proof isolation suit was so happy that he almost jumped up.

At this moment, someone pushed the door open and came in.

“Doctor, what made you so happy?”

Dr. Warne could not hide his excitement. “Niu Hulu agreed to add me as a friend!”

“Really?”

Dr. Warne nodded. “Little Su, do you think I should greet him now? Then we can discuss artificial intelligence?”

Dr. Warne was a technology fanatic.

......

He had made great contributions to human scientific research. When he saw that Niu Hulu YC was better than those foreigners on the international websites, he had long wanted to discuss his expertise with Niu Hulu.

However, Niu Hulu was too mysterious. It was as if he had come from nowhere. He had never found an opportunity.

He did not expect to have his account added today!

When a big shot met a big shot who was even better than him, all that was left was excitement and excitement. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Little su said, “I heard that great god Niu Hu only recognizes money and not people. Professor, you can give him a mission first and then talk about other things.”

“Well, Little Su, you’re still thoughtful.”

Ye Zhuo felt that this Warne was quite interesting.

After getting her to do a mission worth 700,000 yuan, she asked a lot of questions about future technology.

For example, a spaceship that could travel at the speed of light, miniaturized development, a castle in the sky...

Moreover, the questions he asked were all very professional.

In the end, he even suggested adding wechat.

Ye Zhuo hesitated but did not agree.

Because her wechat was filled with family and friends, she did not want to expose her life to a third-dimensional stranger.

On the other end of the screen, Dr. Warne frowned and said, “Xiao Su, he did not agree.”

Xiao su comforted him, “Haste makes waste. Doctor, don’t worry. This kind of thing has to be done slowly.”

Dr. Warne could only nod his head.

He was already very satisfied to be able to add Niu Hulu’s account. Why was he still delusional about wechat?

Ye Zhuo had been online frequently for the past few days to do missions, and he had done several in an hour.

There were more and more accounts with the prefix “Niu Hulu”on the Forum.

Niu Hulu, I am 123456: [ Dad is awesome! ]

Niu Hulu, Qiangguo, and Yu Di: [ dad, please leave some good genes for your son! ]

Niu Hulu, Lou 800: [ F * ck! Dad just agreed to my friend Request! Hurry up and add it! ]

Niu Hulu, I have a Husky: [ I really added it! Thank you, Lao 800! ]

For a moment, countless accounts with the prefix Niu Hu Lu added ye Zhuo as a friend.

And the additional messages were all: [ Daddy, I am your long-lost son! ]

Ye Zhuo looked at the thousands of friend messages and slightly raised her eyebrows.

When did she have so many sons?

But... it was a waste to give up such a cheap son.

It was just that with so many sons coming at the same time, it was too troublesome to agree to each and every one of them by hand.

Ye Zao had a flash of inspiration and lowered his head to write a script. He immediately agreed in bulk.

Just as he finished processing his friends’messages, the class bell rang. Ye Zao put away his phone.

“F * ck! F * ck! These people are too good at causing trouble!”An Lizi held her phone and suddenly exclaimed.

“What’s Wrong?”Ye Zao looked back slightly.

An Lizi handed the phone to ye Zao. “Zao, take a look for yourself!”

Ye Zao lowered his eyes slightly and saw the comments about her plastic surgery.

An Lizi was almost angered to death. “They’re the ones who had plastic surgery! Their entire family has plastic surgery! A bunch of lemon sprites who can’t stand seeing other people’s good looks!”

Ye Zao took out his phone again and checked the IP address of the person who posted it.

It was a very strange IP address.

It was a high-tech intelligent system that was somewhat similar to the world she lived in.

This system was similar to a plug-in.

Hence, it had another name, a plug-in system.

Ye Zhuo was also one of the founders of this system.

But because of this plug-in system, many people were unwilling to work hard. They relied on the system for everything, and their intelligence gradually shrank, turning into marionettes.

The founders realized that something was wrong. In order to prevent humans from becoming the system’s puppets, they joined forces to destroy the system!

But now, how did the external system appear in this world?

Ye Zhuo frowned slightly and traced the thread back to Mu Yourong.

After all, this thread was aimed at her, and the direct beneficiary was Mu Yourong.
