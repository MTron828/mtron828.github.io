“At this point, Ye Zhuo paused for a moment, he then continued, “After the first emperor unified the six kingdoms, he created the imperial system, centralized power, county system, unified measurement and balance system, currency, ideology, the same way of doing things, the same way of doing things, building straight roads, the Great Wall, channels, conquering the north, attacking the Xiongnu in the north, and opening up the southwest of the northern border! “Building the Great Wall was also for the safety of the lives and property of the people at the northern border!” ”

“The first emperor did more than that. Most Ancient Emperors liked to bury living people with them, but the mausoleum of the first emperor of Qin replaced them with a large number of terracotta warriors. ”

“If the first emperor was really a tyrant, he would not have made terracotta warriors. He would have just used living people! ”

But the first emperor did not!

Ye Zao spoke fluent English. Every word and sentence was clear and easy to understand.

“Jamila looked at ye Zao, she sighed, “So I’ve misunderstood the first emperor for so many years! “Before this, I always thought that the first emperor was a great tyrant. It turns out that he did so many good things for the country and the people. “Dr. YC, your understanding of Chinese history is too thorough!” ”

Ye Zao smiled faintly. “Because I’m Chinese!”

“Although ye Zao was Chinese, Jamila still felt that ye Zao was amazing. After all, not every Chinese could understand this part of history so thoroughly. ”

“Very soon, they reached the entrance of the Great Wall. ”

“Although it was winter, there were quite a number of tourists on the Great Wall. ”

“Although it was not ye Zao’s first time on the Great Wall, he could not help but sigh every time. ”

The Ancients were really amazing!

“It was winter. Standing on the Great Wall and looking down, there was snow everywhere. The whole world looked like it was covered in snow. It was extremely beautiful! ”

Dr. Cara and the others were even more shocked. They kept taking pictures with their phones.

“Ye Zao walked over and said, “Let me help you take a group photo?” ”

“”Sure!”Dr. Cara nodded. “Dr. YC, I’ll have to Trouble You Then!” ”

“No problem.”Ye Zhuo took the phone from Cara and helped them take a photo.

“After taking the photo, they continued to walk forward. ”

“What’s that outfit? It’s so beautiful!”Tina covered her mouth with her hands and said in surprise.

Ye Zhuo looked up and saw a young woman in the Empress uniform of the Qing dynasty walking toward them.

The woman had a dignified temperament. Her eyebrows were mottled and her face was covered with dignified makeup. She looked like a harem queen on TV. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Ye Zhuo explained, “This is the Empress’s crown dress from the Qing dynasty.” ”

“Is it something that only the empress can wear?”Tina asked.

“”In ancient times, only the empress could wear it, but now it’s different!” ”

“Tina quickly asked, “So you can wear it whenever you want now?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“”It’s so beautiful, I like it so much!” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “You can try it if you have the chance.” ”

“Okay.”Tina nodded.

“At this moment, a commotion came from the crowd. ”

“Catch the thief! Catch the Thief!”

“Then, a black shadow flashed past ye Zao with a whoosh. ”

“Before the crowd could react, the black shadow had already disappeared in front of them. ”

“Ye Zao looked ahead and narrowed his eyes. He turned his head to look at Tina. “Dr. Tina, please lend me the book in Your Hand.” ”

“Tina had just bought this book at the foot of the Great Wall. It was about the Great Wall, and because it was an English-chinese translation, it was thicker. ”

“Tina handed the book to Ye Zao, but before she could react, ye Zao threw the book in his hand forward. ”

Bang!

“It seemed to be a casual movement, but it accurately hit the black shadow in front of him, and the Black Shadow was directly smashed to the ground. ”

Ye Zao took a step forward and ran over.

The Black Shadow on the ground also reacted at this time. It quickly got up and ran forward.

“Stop!”

“Ye Zao caught up with the Black Shadow. First, he used a backspin kick, and then he used a grappling hand to catch the Black Shadow. ”

“From the back, the posture was indescribably handsome. ”

The crowd on the Great Wall turned to look at the Prime Minister.

“”Let go of me! Let Go of me!”The black shadow kept struggling, the man who stole seemed to be in his thirties. He was dressed like a dog, but from his looks and clothes, it was impossible to tell that he would do such a thing. ”

“”Catch the Thief!”At this moment, the young woman who shouted ‘catch the thief’also caught up. She panted and thanked ye Zao, “Thank, thank you! Missy, you are really amazing!” ”
