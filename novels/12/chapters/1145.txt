Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly.

“Auntie Wang took out the prescription from her pocket. “President Ye, may I ask if this was written by You?” ”

“Ye Zhuo took the prescription. “Yes, this was written by me.” ”

“However, she had written it for Granny Zhou. How did it end up in Auntie Wang’s hands? ”

“Auntie Wang continued, “This prescription was given to me by Old Madam Zhou!” ”

“Because Ma Jiayue had said that this prescription was written by Ye Zhuo, it had nothing to do with the Zhou family. ”

“Therefore, Aunt Wang came to thank ye Zhuo. ”

“If it weren’t for ye Zhuo’s prescription, Su Qiang wouldn’t have recovered so quickly. ”

“”I see.”Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Since Your Lover is fine, then Granny Zhou must be fine too, right?” ”

“Hearing this, Aunt Wang’s expression was a little complicated. ”

She might have to disappoint ye Zao.

Because Granny Zhou didn’t believe ye Zao and didn’t take the medicine at all.

“After a moment, Aunt Wang raised her eyes to look at ye Zao and said tactfully, “Old Lady Zhou has been taking other medicine during this period of time and hasn’t had the time to take your medicine.” ”

Ye Zao understood what was going on the moment he heard it.

At this moment.

Bang —

The door was pushed open from outside.

“Zhao Xueyin pointed at ye Zao and said, “Officer Wang! She’s Ye Zao!” ”

“This is the victim’s family member!”

“”Ye Zao, Right! Please come with me!”A few policemen walked over to ye Zao’s side. ”

“Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly, but there was no expression on his face. “Do you have an arrest warrant?” ”

“Officer Wang, who was in the lead, was stunned for a moment. “Although there isn’t an arrest warrant yet, someone reported that you were suspected of practicing medicine without a license and injuring a person’s life. Now that the evidence and evidence are missing, please come with us!” ”

Ye Zhuo raised his eyes slightly. “May I ask where the evidence and evidence are?”

“Officer Wang said, “Miss Zhao is the witness, and this prescription is the evidence!” ”

“Zhao Xueyin walked to sister-in-law Wang’s side. “Sister-in-law Wang, right? Don’t worry, officer Wang will definitely return justice to you and make ye Zhuo, the murderer, pay with his life!” ”

“Sister-in-law Wang was a little confused. “What justice? What do you mean by pay with his life? Miss Zhao, what are you talking about? I don’t understand!” ”

“Although Zhao Xueyin didn’t know Auntie Wang, Auntie Wang knew Zhao Xueyin. ”

“After all, Zhao Xueyin often went to the Zhou family. ”

“When she heard the words ‘murderer’, Auntie Wang was extremely anxious. ”

“She quickly looked up at officer Wang, “Police comrades, you must have made a mistake! Miss ye is our family’s greatest benefactor! If it wasn’t for her, my wife’s diabetes wouldn’t have healed! She’s not a murderer!” ”

What?

Zhao Xueyin was stunned.

Auntie Wang’s wife had recovered?

How could that be!

They must have been a step too late. Auntie Wang had been bribed.

Ma Jiayue had already said that there was something wrong with the prescription.

How could auntie Wang’s wife have recovered?

“Zhao Xueyin looked at Auntie Wang. “Auntie Wang, you must have been bribed by Ye Zhuo, right? If no one died, why are you crying? You’re covering up for her. You’re an accomplice! You’re going to jail!” ”

“Sister-in-law Wang was on the verge of tears. “I wasn’t bribed! My wife is fine, she’s in the hospital right now! If you don’t believe me, you can go and take a look!” ”

“Hearing that, officer Wang looked at the police officer beside him and narrowed his eyes slightly. ”

In the hospital?

Could it be in the morgue?

“Zhao Xueyin continued, “Then we’ll go to the hospital right now. Do you dare to go?” ”

“Yes! We’ll go now!”Sister-in-law Wang said.

“”President Ye, What About You?”Zhao Xueyin looked at ye Zao. ”

Ye Zao leaned against the office desk with his arms crossed over his chest. His posture was casual. “Why do I have to go?”

“”I think you have a guilty conscience, right?”Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes. ”

Guilty Conscience.

Definitely guilty conscience.

It was not a big deal if someone died. Ye Zao definitely wanted to take advantage of them to go to the hospital and escape!

“Ye Zhuo turned to look at officer Wang. “Officer, comrade, if this Auntie’s lover is fine after I go, then does Miss Zhao’s behavior constitute slander?” ”

“”Yes.”Officer Wang nodded, ”

“the corners of Ye Zhuo’s mouth curled up slightly. “Then from a legal point of view, how will the crime of slander be dealt with?” ”

“Officer Wang continued, “According to Miss Zhao’s behavior, if it really constitutes a crime of slander, she will be detained for less than 10 days and fined 5,000 yuan. She will also apologize to you.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo snapped his fingers and stood up straight. “I’ll go with you.”

“”Then, please.” ” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Ye Zhuo was about to raise his foot when he seemed to remember something. He continued, “Let me take something.” ”

Take Something?

Take what?

Could it be something that could run away?

Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes.

Ye Zhuo picked up a black backpack.
