“”She was a wretched girl to begin with!”Mother Zhou continued, “Our Rui Rui is more beautiful and elegant than pan an. Even without that wretched girl, Cen Yuyan would still fall for her!” ”

“Father Zhou smiled and said, “This sentence is indeed correct. In the future, our old Zhou family will rely on Rui Rui to carry forward!” ”

“Mother Zhou’s face was filled with a proud smile, “That’s right. If this were in ancient times, our Rui Rui would be the emperor’s son-in-law! I heard Rui Rui say that fifth master cen is an unmarried man. When that time comes, everything in the Cen family will belong to our old Zhou family!” ”

...

The second episode of the village’s program had already ended. Cen Yuyan directly asked Zhou Rui to send her to song Chenyu’s residence.

“Zhou Rui looked at Cen Yuyan and said with some jealousy, “What good friend? is he more important than me?” ”

“Cen Yuyan smiled and said, “He’s a very good friend. Don’t worry, I’ll introduce the two of you to each other when I have time.” ”

“Okay.”Zhou Rui nodded.

Cen Yuyan then instructed Zhou Rui to drive carefully before walking inside.

“Song Chenyu knew that Cen Yuyan was coming, so he waited at home early. “How do you feel about meeting your parents today?” ”

“”Very good.”Cen Yuyan smiled and said, “Look, this is the legacy bracelet his mother gave me.” ”

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “In that case, their family already thinks of you as their future daughter-in-law?” ”

“”En.”Cen Yuyan nodded and continued, “Right, when do you think I’ll bring Zhou Rui to meet our family?” ”

“Song Chenyu hesitated for a moment, then said, “It’s fine to meet your family, but don’t let Zhou Rui meet miss ye for the time being.” ”

“Why?”Cen Yuyan asked.

“Song Chenyu said, “Because Miss Ye is too outstanding. Even Lu Xiu was attracted by Miss Ye. I’m afraid...”the rest of his words were self-evident. ”

Cen Yuyan’s face immediately darkened.

Why was Ye Zhuo so Shameless?

Cen Yuyan became even angrier when she thought of the two slaps Cen Shaoqing had given her. She wished that Ye Zhuoyuan could die on the spot.

“Song Chenyu patted Cen Yuyan’s hand and continued, “But don’t worry. All of this is just my guess. Maybe Zhou Rui isn’t the kind of person I think he is.” ”

“CEN Yuyan continued, “Tomorrow is my second sister’s child’s birthday party. Chenyu, come with me to the birthday party.”Old Mrs. Cen had already explicitly forbade her from bringing song Chenyu to the CEN family. ”

“However, she had to create an opportunity for song Chenyu and Cen Shaoqing. ”

The birthday party this time was not bad.

“Me?”Song Chenyu hesitated. “Isn’t this not too good?”

“”You’re my best sister. What’s so bad about this!”CEN Yuyan continued, “It’s settled then!” ”

“Then... Alright.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Cen Yueya’s child was 10 years old this year.

The birthday party was very grand. Almost all the high officials and nobles in the capital had arrived.

“The moment Cen Yuyan and song Chenyu entered, they saw ye Zhuo and Lu Xiu standing together. They were far away, so they couldn’t hear what the two were talking about. However, they could see that Lu Xiu’s face was full of smiles. ”

“Shameless!”Cen Yuyan’s expression was very ugly.

Song Chenyu patted Cen Yuyan’s hand.

“Lu Xiu admired ye Zao very much. After discussing technology issues with ye Zao for a while, he continued, “Father Ye, when you say you like someone, do you place this love in your heart and then silently protect her, watching her be happy?” ”

“Lu Xiu didn’t have many good friends, and no one usually gave him any ideas. ”

“Although ye Zao was young, he was better than him in all aspects. ”

“Ye Zhuo frowned without leaving a trace, “This is a scoring situation. If the other party also likes you, you can always protect her and give her happiness. But if the other party does not have any feelings for you and only uses you as a spare tire, then this kind of protection becomes meaningless! “She is not worth it for you to do this. There are plenty of other women in the world, so why must you love a single flower?” ”

“But what if the other party has some unspeakable reason for not being able to accept my feelings?”Lu Xiu asked.

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “The person you’re talking about is song Chenyu, right?” ”

“Lu Xiu was stunned. “Father Ye, you can tell?” ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Ever since song Chenyu appeared, you’ve been looking in her direction. “You like song Chenyu, but Cen Yuyan liked you before. Because Cen Yuyan is song Chenyu’s good friend, Song Chenyu can’t accept your feelings because of this problem, right?” ”

“Ye Zhuo had actually seen through this twist long ago, but he didn’t point it out. ”

“Seeing that Cen Yuyan was still being played around by Song Chenyu, Ye Zhuo really couldn’t stand it anymore. ”

Lu Xiu nodded.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “As far as I know, Cen Yuyan already has a boyfriend. “Why don’t you confess to Song Chenyu again? If song Chenyu likes you, you two can be together. “If she doesn’t have feelings for you, then there’s no need for you to continue protecting her, unless you want to spend the rest of your life alone.” ”

“Cen Yuyan really has a boyfriend?”Lu Xiu raised his head to look at Ye Zhuo.

“Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “So, if you like her, then be brave and chase after her.” ”

“”Father Ye, thank you.”Lu Xiu bowed in excitement. ”

“”You’re welcome. We’re all family.”Lu Xiu still called her father. If he and song Chenyu became a couple, then song Chenyu would become her daughter-in-law. ”

The birthday party continued.

“When ye Zhuo finished his sixth dessert, Lu Xiu finally called song Chenyu to the other side. ”

Ye Zhuo’s lips curved slightly.

He put down the half-eaten dessert and walked toward the birthday girl.

“Tian Tian.”

“Little aunt.”

“Ye Zhuo half-squatted down. “Tian Tian, can you do me a favor?” ”

“Okay.”Tian Tian nodded.

Ye Zhuo whispered a few words into Tian Tian’s ear.

“Tian Tian smiled and said, “Don’t worry, little aunt. I Promise I’ll take care of it for you.” ”

“Be Good.”Ye Zhuo patted Tian Tian’s little head.

Tian Tian quickly ran to Cen Yuyan’s side. “Fourth aunt!”

“”What’s wrong, Tian Tian?”Cen Yuyan lowered her head. ”

“Tian Tian continued, “Fourth aunt, I think my pendant fell into the small garden. Can you accompany me to look for it?” ”

“Sure.”Cen Yuyan nodded.

The two of them arrived at the small garden.

“Cen Yuyan turned to look at Tian Tian. “Tian Tian, What’s your pendant...” ”

“At this moment, Tian Tian suddenly made a ‘hush’gesture. “Fourth aunt, it sounds like someone is talking.” ”

“Cen Yuyan focused slightly and indeed, she heard a familiar male voice. ”

“”... “... Chenyu, I don’t want to continue like this. Previously, because of Cen Yuyan’s matter, you weren’t willing to accept me. Now that Cen Yuyan has found a boyfriend, I don’t know what other concerns you have. I only want an answer from you. Is it that difficult “...”. “...” ”

“”Lu Xiu, don’t you think that you’re too selfish? You Don’t really love me. You just want to get me and possess me!” ”

“Sink Fish...”

“Hearing these words, Cen Yuyan’s face turned pale and her entire body was trembling. ”
