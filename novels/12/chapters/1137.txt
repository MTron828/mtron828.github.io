“Chapter 1138: 248: When I see Zhao Xueyin’s true face, I’ll cut her in half! 2”

Translator: 549690339

“In the end, she ended up in a mess. ”

Jiang Xiaoyu had never thought that Zhao Xueyin was so scheming before.

Combined with what ye Zao said last night and Zhao Xueyin’s reaction today...

She felt that ye Zao was quite right.

Perhaps.

She had always been a chess piece in Zhao Xueyin’s hands.

“Jiang Xiaoyu raised her head and looked at Zhao Xueyin. “Xueyin, is what Annie said true?” ”

“Yes.”Zhao Xueyin nodded.

“In the next second, Jiang Xiaoyu would definitely be filled with righteous indignation and want to avenge her. ”

“Jiang Xiaoyu continued, “Xueyin, is there a misunderstanding between you and Miss Ye?” ”

A misunderstanding?

Shouldn’t Jiang Xiaoyu Scold ye Zao first before avenging her?

Saying that there was a misunderstanding didn’t seem like Jiang Xiaoyu’s style!

“”It’s not a misunderstanding.”Zhao Xueyin sighed. “The higher-ups of the company, including Big Brother Si, have all been bribed by Ye Zhuo. Xiaoyu, I’m very likely to be chased out of the financial group by Ye Zhuo soon...” ”

“Jiang Xiaoyu held Zhao Xueyin’s hand and said, “Xueyin, it must be a misunderstanding! “Actually, Miss Ye is a very outstanding and kind-hearted girl. Besides, didn’t you say that last night? “If you and her are not competitors, you really hope to become friends with her.” ”

Outstanding?

Kind-hearted?

These two keywords have something to do with ye Zao?

What the Hell Is Jiang Xiaoyu thinking?

“”Xiaoyu, you’ve changed.”Zhao Xueyin looked at Jiang Xiaoyu in disbelief. ”

He had become so unfamiliar.

Jiang Xiaoyu wasn’t like this in the past.

The Jiang Xiaoyu in the past was very loyal.

He fought wherever he pointed!

“But now, Jiang Xiaoyu had learned to resist. ”

Would a good friend be like Jiang Xiaoyu?

It turned out that time could really change a person.

Zhao Xueyin looked at Jiang Xiaoyu with disappointment. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“”I haven’t changed.”Jiang Xiaoyu looked at Zhao Xueyin. “You’re the one who changed? Zhao Xueyin, let me ask you, am I a chess piece in your heart? A chess piece that can be controlled by anyone?” ”

Chess piece?

“Hearing this, Zhao Xueyin’s eyes were filled with shock. ”

How could she treat Jiang Xiaoyu as a chess piece?

She had always treated Jiang Xiaoyu as her best friend.

A good friend should be willing to do anything.

“Now that she had encountered a stumbling block in her life, what was Jiang Xiaoyu’s role in clearing the obstacles and paving the way for her? ”

She did not ask Jiang Xiaoyu to do anything overboard.

Zhao Xueyin did not expect Jiang Xiaoyu to be such a calculative person!

“Unless, Jiang Xiaoyu did not treat her as a friend at all! ”

She could only blame herself for seeing the wrong person.

She had made the wrong friend!

“Zhao Xueyin looked at Jiang Xiaoyu and said bitterly, “No! Xiaoyu, in My Heart, you are my best friend! Why would you think that way! You said that I treat you as a chess piece? How is that possible!” ”

“Jiang Xiaoyu said, “Since I was young, I have always been a bad person in front of you. You have always been the good person standing in front of me! This has caused everyone to think that there is something wrong with my character!” ”

“”But we’re best friends, aren’t we?”Zhao Xueyin’s eyes were red. “I never thought that you would care about these things!” ”

Zhao Xueyin really didn’t take these things to heart.

She felt that these were things that good friends should do.

She looked at Zhao Xueyin who was standing in front of her.

Jiang Xiaoyu couldn’t tell what expression she had on her face.

It had been more than 20 years.

Jiang Xiaoyu had never thought that he was so stupid.

So stupid that he was cute.

“”Good friend?”Jiang Xiaoyu looked at Zhao Xueyin with a self-deprecating smile on his face. “Should a good friend block a knife for you? Forget it, it’s my fault for being so stupid! I didn’t recognize you!” ”

Zhao Xueyin was very anxious. “Xiaoyu! Why do you think so? I really treat you as a good friend!”

“Jiang Xiaoyu stood up from the chair and said, “Zhao Xueyin, let’s end this once and for all. You take your sunny path, and I’ll take mine.” ”

Her words were not sloppy at all.

Then.

She turned around and left.

“Seeing Jiang Xiaoyu turn around and leave, Zhao Xueyin also stood up from the chair and said, “Xiaoyu!” ”

Jiang Xiaoyu ignored Zhao Xueyin and walked forward without looking back.

Things were getting out of her control.

Zhao Xueyin had never thought that Jiang Xiaoyu would break with her one day.

“However, Zhao Xueyin wasn’t worried. ”

“Because soon, Jiang Xiaoyu would come back crying and apologize to her. ”

“All these years, the Jiang Corporation had been in a state of loss. ”

“Without her help, the Jiang Corporation would only go bankrupt. ”
