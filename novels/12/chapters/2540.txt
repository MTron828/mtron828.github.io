“”I’m fine,”Vivi said. ”

The nurse looked at Vivi. “Did you encounter something troubling you?”

“”No,”Vivi denied. ”

“The nurse continued, “Vivi, a child your age shouldn’t have too much trouble. If you have any trouble, remember to tell the adults.”Although Vivi was financially independent, she was still a child, she was much more mature than her peers, but in the end, she was still a child. Since she was a child, she shouldn’t have too many worries. ”

“After saying this, the nurse turned to look at Vivi. “You can tell me, or you can tell the other doctors and nurses.” ”

“Okay.”Vivi nodded.

“The nurse continued, “So now can you tell me what worries you have?” ”

“”I don’t have any worries,”Vivi said. ”

“The nurse smiled and said, “Alright then.”Since Vivi didn’t want to say it, she couldn’t force it. ”

“Soon, she walked to the ward. ”

The nurse knocked on the door. “Miss Ye.”

“Ye Zao, who was in the room, turned around slightly and looked outside with a smile. “Vivi is back.” ”

“Vivi still had some resistance against ye Zao. She was angry that ye Zao had lied to her. However, at this moment, when she suddenly saw ye Zao’s smile, she was no longer angry. She smiled and jogged in. “Sister Ye.” ”

“Ye Zao continued, “Vivi, I heard from the nurse that you have been in a bad mood recently. What happened? Can you tell me? If you tell me, I might be able to help you.” ”

“”No,”Vivi denied. ”

“Ye Zao did not continue the topic. “That’s good. By the way, the surgery is tomorrow. Will someone come to your house?” ”

“Although Vivi’s family environment was a little complicated, she still had to inform the family members that she should inform. ”

“”No.”Vivi shook her head. She looked at ye Zao and said, “Sister Ye, i. . . I. . . I don’t want to operate anymore.” ”

“”You don’t want to operate?”Ye Zao was stunned for a moment and asked, “Why?”During this period of time, Vivi had been very cooperative with the treatment. Her mood suddenly became so negative that ye Zao was a little confused. ”

“”I just don’t want to operate anymore. Sister Ye, don’t ask why,”Vivi said. ”

“Ye Zao looked at Vivi. “Vivi, if you don’t have the surgery earlier, your illness will get worse and worse.” ”

“”It’s okay.”No matter how serious it was, it wouldn’t be worse than now. Anyway, she was already on the verge of death. Although Vivi was reluctant to part with this world, what could she do? Most of the time, people didn’t have a choice. ”

“”Vivi, I’m a doctor. I have to be complicated with patients. Tell me, what happened?” ”

“”Nothing really happened. I just don’t want to operate anymore. It doesn’t make any difference to me whether I live or Die.”Vivi raised her head and looked at Ye Zao. “Sister Ye, don’t worry about me. I’m really fine.” ”

“Ye Zao frowned without leaving a trace. “Vivi, you’re not only irresponsible to yourself, but also irresponsible to support and like you.” ”

Vivi did not speak anymore. She was determined not to arrange the surgery anymore.

“”Vivi, I don’t know what happened in the past two days, but I know that there’s no obstacle in life that can’t be overcome.”Ye Zao continued, “If you encounter any difficulties, just tell me directly. I’ll handle the rest of the matters for you. You just need to focus on preparing for the surgery.” ”

Vivi still did not speak.

“The nurse on the side could not stand it anymore and could not help but say, “Vivi! Miss ye is talking to you! You should at least answer her.”It was also ye Zao’s patience. If it were anyone else, they would not have said so much to Vivi. ”

“Vivi continued, “Sister Ye, I know that you care about me and want me to live well, but I really don’t want to continue like this. You clearly know...”at this point, vivi’s words stopped abruptly. Although ye Zao had concealed her illness, it was for her own good. She had to know what was good for her. She was grateful to Ye Zao. ”

“Vivi paused and said, “Sister Ye, don’t ask why. There’s no reason. If there is, it’s because I don’t want the surgery.” ”

“”Vivi, have you really thought it through?”Ye Zhuo asked. ”

“Yes.”Vivi nodded. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“No regrets?”Ye Zhuo continued to ask.

“No Regrets.”Vivi’s expression was very firm.

“Ye Zhuo’s face did not show much anger. He just said, “Vivi, I won’t cancel the surgery for the time being. You should also calm down. If you have anything to say to me, you can contact me on wechat at any time.” ”
