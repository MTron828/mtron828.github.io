“Hearing Zhou Rui’s voice, Zhang Pandi felt disgusted. ”

“Zhou Rui’s voice sounded a little anxious. “Pandi! It’s over, it’s over! Miss Tang has been chased out of the base! The Tang family’s laboratory is going to have a new leader. What do you think we should do?” ”

Zhang Pandi furrowed her brows tightly.

What to do.

How would she know what to do!

She had wanted to join the CEN base with Zhou Rui and become the leader of the base. Who would have thought that things would turn out like this!

“”Zhou Rui, let’s break up.”Zhang Pandi said. ”

“At this point, she had to break up with Zhou Rui immediately. ”

“When she heard this, Zhou Rui was furious. “Zhang Pandi! What did you say? Say It again for me!” ”

“Zhang Panti took a deep breath, “I said, let’s break up!” ”

“”In your dreams! Zhang Panti, now that I have nothing, you want to break up with me! Let me tell you, it’s impossible! I’m not a ball in your hands that you can kick whenever you want!”Zhou Rui was not a fool, he knew that Zhang Panti had a purpose in being with him, but he did not expect this woman to change her face so quickly! ”

“Tang Xue had just been chased away by the CEN base a second ago, and Zhang Pandi was going to break up with him the next second! ”

“Zhang Pandi frowned. “Zhou Rui, can’t we just get together and part?” ”

“”Bah! Dream On! Zhang Pandi, let me tell you, I will not break up with you!” ”

“Hearing this, Zhang Pandi was also angry. She was not married to Zhou Rui, and she was not engaged. Why should Zhou Rui tie her up? ”

“”Zhou Rui, breaking up is my freedom. I just came to inform you!”After saying this, Zhang Panti hung up the phone. Then, she blacklisted Zhou Rui’s number and wechat. ”

“After doing all this, Zhang Panti took a deep breath. Next, she should think of a way to get Yu Zifei back. ”

Today was Saturday.

“According to her understanding of Yu Zifei, today Yu Zifei would definitely return to the old city district to see his parents. ”

“Thinking of this, Zhang Pandi quickly packed up, changed into good-looking clothes, put on decent makeup, and drove to the old city district. ”

“An hour later, the car stopped below a dilapidated unit. ”

Zhang Pandi took out a gift from the trunk and prepared to go upstairs.

“Just then, she suddenly saw a middle-aged woman carrying a grocery bag walking over from the other side. ”

“When she saw the person, Zhang Pandi’s eyes lit up. She immediately smiled and greeted, “Auntie!” ”

That’s right.

“The person who came was Yu Zifei’s mother, Tian Zhifang. ”

“Tian Zhifang used to like Zhang Pandi very much, but she didn’t expect that Zhang Pandi would betray Yu Zifei. “Zhang Pandi, what are you doing here?” ”

“”Auntie, I came specially to see you.”Zhang Pandi’s attitude was sincere. “I have a little misunderstanding with Zifei...” ”

“Misunderstanding?”Tian Zhifang was so angry that she laughed. “You think our son is useless and hooked up with the big leader of your base in the blink of an eye. Is this a misunderstanding?”

Zhang Panti didn’t expect Yu Zifei to tell Tian Zhifang all this.

This was a private matter between her and Yu Zifei. Why did Yu Zifei tell Tian Zhifang everything?

“But now was not the time to pursue this matter, zhang Pandi said with red eyes, “Aunty, I know I was wrong. I really was wrong. Please forgive me for the sake of me and Zifei for so many years, okay? I promise I won’t do it again!” ”

“At the end, Zhang Pandi directly knelt down to Tian Zhifang. ”

“”Aunty, if you don’t forgive me, I won’t get up today!” ”

“Tian Zhifang frowned, “Are you out of your mind? ! Do you think our family isn’t 250? If you want it, then take it. If you don’t want it, then don’t! You’re willing to kneel, right? Since you’re willing to kneel, then kneel! Even if you kneel to death here today, our family won’t look at you anymore!” ”

“After saying that, Tian Zhifang turned around and left. ”

“Zhang Pandi knelt on the ground and shouted loudly, “Auntie!” ”

Tian Zhifang acted as if she didn’t hear anything. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Very soon, Zhang Pandi’s actions attracted the attention of the residents of the neighborhood. ”

“An old man walked over and asked curiously, “Little girl, what happened to you? Why are you kneeling here?” ”

Zhang Pandi didn’t say anything.

“An aunt who was buying vegetables passed by and continued, “Isn’t this the daughter-in-law of the old Yu Family? Why is she kneeling here?” ”

“Yu Zifei had just been interviewed by the television station. In the blink of an eye, Zhang Pandi was kneeling below their house. This scene made the people who were eating melon seeds think nothing of it. ”
