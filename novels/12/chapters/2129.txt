“Looking at the heartless Cen Haifeng, duanmu huangfei continued, “You let me go, have you ever thought about my situation! I said, marrying you was not my own will! I once had a young man I liked, but it was because of your appearance that I became like this! For You, for your son on Earth, I didn’t even have my own child! I’ve given everything for you, but now, you actually want me to leave! Tell me, where do you want me to go? You’re not asking me to leave! You’re asking me to Die!” ”

“If she was really chased away by Cen Haifeng, she might as well die. ”

“Now that she had nothing, if she was really chased away, what face would she have to be a slut? ”

The once glorious wife of the chief alliance had actually become a concubine!

“Hearing this, Cen Haifeng’s expression changed. ”

“Indeed, he could not completely remove himself from this matter. ”

“He was at fault. The system of the Chief Alliance was at fault, but Duanmu Huangfei was not without the slightest fault. ”

“”Don’t worry, I will properly arrange the matters later,”cen Haifeng continued, “I won’t let you suffer!” ”

“Duanmu huangfei turned to look at Cen Haifeng, his eyes full of sarcasm, “Arrangement? How are you going to arrange it? The best arrangement you can make now is to forget about the people and matters on earth and wait patiently for the Great Elder and the National Master to take over the eastern fence. You just have to follow the ancestral teachings!” ”

Follow the ancestral teachings?

Impossible!

“Cen Haifeng’s face was filled with anger. “Duanmu Huangfei, I’ll give you a way out. If you don’t, then don’t blame me for not remembering our past friendship!” ”

“After saying this, Cen Haifeng turned around and left! ”

Duanmu Fengfei looked at Cen Haifeng’s determined back with a vicious look in her eyes.

Wait.

She would definitely make Cen Haifeng pay the price!

It was definitely not that simple for CEN Haifeng to kick her out!

Duanmu fengfei immediately took out her communicator and sent a message to her assistant.

Duanmu Fengfei had been the wife of the General Alliance for so many years and had also cultivated some forces.

The assistant replied very quickly.

“After contacting the assistant, Duanmu Huangfei returned to the Chief Alliance Mansion. ”

The first thing Cen Haifeng had to do was to go to the Chang Yue country to thank Shao Qing and Zhuo Ye.

“If it weren’t for these two young men, he wouldn’t have remembered everything so quickly. ”

“However, after going to the Chang Yue country, he found out that there were no people named Shao Qing and Zhuo Ye in the Chang Yue country. ”

Shao Qing.

“At this moment, Cen Haifeng suddenly thought of something. ”

Could it be...

Shao Qing was Shao Qing?

Cen Haifeng’s face turned slightly pale when he thought of this.

“”Mr. Chief Alliance.”At this moment, the special assistant walked to Cen Haifeng’s side. ”

“What’s the matter?”

The special assistant lowered his voice and whispered a few words into CEN Haifeng’s ear.

Cen Haifeng’s expression immediately changed when he heard this. He immediately went to Duanmu Fengfei’s room.

Duanmu Fengfei sat in front of the table to make tea. She was in good spirits and was not as dispirited as she had imagined.

It was as if this matter had not changed anything for her.

“When she heard the commotion, she did not raise her head and did not say anything. ”

Cen Haifeng walked over and directly lifted Duanmu Fengfei’s tea set.

Bang.

The top-quality tea set shattered on the ground.

“What’s wrong with you now?”Duanmu fengfei looked at Cen Haifeng.

“Cen Haifeng grabbed Duanmu Fengfei’s hair and said angrily, “Duanmu Fengfei! I really misjudged you! You Vicious Woman!” ”

Duanmu Fengfei’s heart skipped a beat.

Could it be that the people she sent to Earth were discovered by Cen Haifeng?

No.

It couldn’t be. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“”You still have the face to ask me what’s Wrong?”CEN Haifeng continued, “Tell Me! Why did you harm them?” ”

“If he hadn’t been worried and sent people to keep an eye on Duanmu huangfei, he would have made a huge mistake! ”

“Duanmu Huangfei’s face turned pale. “Haifeng, I didn’t do anything. I didn’t do anything. Someone must be trying to frame me. Believe me, believe me...” ”

“I only believe what I see and hear!”Cen Haifeng turned to look at his assistant. “Send it to the police station.”

“”Yes, Mr. President.” ”

“Duanmu Fengfei wanted to say something else, but Cen Haifeng directly cut her with his hand. Duanmu fengfei blacked out and fainted. ”

“When she woke up again, she was already locked up in the police station. ”

...

At the CEN residence.

Zhou Xiang woke up very quickly.

But she still did not dare to face reality.

“Old Mrs. Cen sat in front of the bed. “Xiangxiang, you should eat something. Don’t worry, Mom is here. Mom will definitely support you. They want to bully my daughter-in-law! No Way!” ”

“Looking at Old Mrs. Cen, Zhou Xiang suddenly cried out, “Mom!” ”
