“After all, Feng Xianxian really took Lin Ze as her brother! ”

“It was said that a tree was afraid of being skinned, and a person was afraid of being sad. ”

Wasn’t He a Heartbreaker?

“Old Mrs. Lin held Feng Xianxian’s hand, “That child, Ah Ze, is an ungrateful wretch. Forget About You, I’m afraid he won’t even put me in his eyes in the future. Poor me, I worked so hard to raise him. In the end, I might as well raise a dog.” ”

Old Mrs. Lin felt that Lin Ze had disappointed her too much.

“No matter what, she had raised Lin ze single-handedly. ”

But Lin Ze had actually forgotten all about her and went to look for ye Shu!

Ye Shu had raised him for a day?

Any child with a little bit of conscience would not do such a thing.

“Feng Xianxian said in a low voice, “Grandma, don’t say that. Actually, brother Ah Ze is still very sensible. No matter what, Sister Ye Zao is his biological sister. It’s normal for him to be close to Sister Ye Zao.” ”

“”Then I’m still his biological grandmother!”Old Madam Lin felt very sad and emphasized, “I’m the grandmother who raised him!” ”

“She raised Lin ze single-handedly. In the end, Lin Ze was not as filial as Feng Xianxian. ”

Wasn’t that ironic?

Feng Xianxian continued to comfort old madam Lin.

“Feng Qianhua walked over and said, “Aunt Lin, Xianxian is right. Ah Ze is a sensible and good child. Don’t think too much about it! “Oh right, I see that brother Jin Cheng’s daughter is still called ye Zao. I wonder when he plans to change his surname?” ”

“After saying that, Feng Qianhua continued, “Aunt Lin, since the child has already returned, I advise you not to make things difficult for brother Jin Cheng. Hurry up and change the child’s surname.” ”

Only then did old madam Lin remember that ye Zao’s surname had not changed!

“Although she did not like ye Zao, no matter what, Ye Zao was of the Lin family’s bloodline. What was the point of having the Lin family’s bloodline follow that B * Tch Ye Shu’s surname? ”

“Old Madam Lin nodded. “Qianhua, you’re right. I’ll get Jin Cheng to settle this matter when I get back today.” ”

“Hearing this, Feng Qianhua’s eyes flashed with a faint light. She smiled and said, “Aunt Lin, it’s good that you’ve thought it through. After all, we’re still a family. Why are things so tense?” ”

“”Mom, Qianhua, what are you guys talking about?”Zhao shuning walked over from the other side. ”

“Feng Qianhua smiled and said, “Fourth sister-in-law.” ”

“Zhao shuning grabbed Feng Qianhua’s hand and said with a regretful expression, “Qianhua, I always thought that you would be able to walk together with Jin city. I didn’t expect...” ”

The smile on Feng Qianhua’s face did not diminish. “Maybe I’m not fated to be in the capital.”

“”What do you mean by fated? !”Zhao shuning lowered his voice and said, “Things are made by man, and hard work does not disappoint those who have a heart. Qianhua, I’m the same as mother. In My Heart, you will always be my fifth brother and sister-in-law, and everyone else will have to stand aside!”! “Mother, don’t you agree with me?” ”

“Old Lady Lin said happily, “Yes, yes, yes! I’m willing to listen to Shuning’s words.” ”

“Zhao shuning continued, “In any case, I can’t Stand Ye Shu and her daughter! Both of them have the face of a vixen. It’s not that my words are unpleasant, but ye Shu isn’t a good woman. I think that little one isn’t a good person either!” ”

“Zhao shuning’s words hit old Mrs. Lin’s heart, and she hurriedly nodded in agreement. ”

“Feng Qianhua said, “Mom, fourth sister-in-law, you might have misunderstood sister Ye Shu. In fact, she’s a good person...” ”

“Zhao shuning said speechlessly, “Qianhua, no wonder mom always said that you’re a good person! You’re really silly and sweet! If Ye Shu was a good woman, she wouldn’t have hooked up with Jin city and successfully rose to the top! You! You just don’t know how to think for yourself.” ”

“Hearing this, Feng Qianhua lowered her head in embarrassment. ”

Old Lady Lin’s gaze turned to Ye Shu.

“Wu Mei, Zhang Zhenzhen, and Yang Wenyin were chatting with Ye Shu. When the four sisters-in-law stood together, the scene was surprisingly harmonious. ”

Wu Mei originally thought that ye Shu was really as vulgar as the rumors said.

“But after some conversation, she found that Ye Shu was a very thoughtful person. She had a correct outlook on life and had a high social status. She was completely different from the rumors. ”

“Moreover, it was very easy to communicate with Ye Shu. ”

“The four of them became more and more friendly as they chatted. Soon, they added each other on wechat. ”

“Zhang Zhenzhen smiled and said, “Fifth sister-in-law, I’ve pulled you into our family group. You can also pull the eldest niece in later.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Shu nodded.

“Old Mrs. Lin frowned. “It’s fine if the second and third families aren’t sensible, but why are the eldest and third families not sensible? Shuning, go and call the eldest and third families over!”Could it be that Wu Mei didn’t know.., she was very dissatisfied with ye Shu? ”Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m
