“[ Yezi, don’t worry, we’ve always been standing behind you. ]”

[ I was really disgusted by song Chenyu and song Yiwan. How could there be such a shameless person in the world? ]

[ I looked at Yezi’s Weibo. Yezi is really a dessert expert. ]

[ yezi definitely didn’t expect that she would end up eating melon on her own head one day. ]

“[ no matter what, Yezi waited for song Chenyu’s apology. Now, it’s up to the authorities to deal with song Yiwan. ]”

[ I’m waiting for song Yiwan’s ending. ]

[ I’m waiting. ]

Ye Zhuo’s account originally only had a few fans.

“After this incident, it suddenly gained six million fans, and the number was still rising.”

“Just as the matter was heating up, ye Zao posted another Weibo Post.”

“Today, he had to eat melon properly: [ regarding this incident, I have law firm to handle it fully. ]”

[ i support Ye Zi’s rights! ]

[ ye Zi is so tough. ]

[ I’m really afraid that Ye Zi will just let it go. I’m relieved after seeing this Weibo post. ]

Mingwei law firm also quickly issued a statement.

“[ thank you for Your Trust, Miss Ye. Also, the lawyer’s letter has been sent. Yiwan V check it carefully. ]”

On the other side.

“Song yiwan, who was actively cooperating with the public relations department, was so scared that her whole body was trembling when she received the lawyer’s letter.”

“Her manager stood beside song Yiwan, frowning tightly.”

“Normal people would choose to make a big deal out of such a matter, and make a small deal out of it.”

“However, Ye Zhuo had actually sent a lawyer’s letter to sue song Yiwan.”

“This matter had already caused a great impact on song Yiwan. If it really went to court, song Yiwan’s career would be ruined!”

“In this industry, the most taboo thing was to tarnish an artist’s reputation.”

“Ever since she debuted, song Yiwan had never encountered such a helpless moment.”

“Her manager looked at song Yiwan like this and was so angry that her face turned green. “Yiwan, I’ve told you before, sometimes you can’t be so ruthless! You didn’t listen to me! Now that things have turned out like this, are you satisfied?””

“”I didn’t know it would turn out like this...”song Yiwan’s face was full of tears. If she had known that Ye Zhuo had a recording, she definitely wouldn’t have put herself in danger.”

She did this for song Chenyu.

Song Chenyu couldn’t ignore her.

That’s right!

And song Chenyu!

“Song Yiwan took out her phone and opened the Weibo page. When she saw the trending page, she panicked.”

Song Chenyu had actually pushed all the blame onto her.

She had never dreamed that song Chenyu was such a person.

PA —

Song Yiwan threw her phone on the ground.

Wait.

Song Chenyu wouldn’t let her have it easy.

Then song Chenyu wouldn’t have it easy either!

...

On song Chenyu’s side.

“When she saw song Chenyu apologizing to Ye Zhuo, Cen Yuyan was furious. “Chenyu, wait! I’ll Get Ye Zhuo to post an apology to you right now. I’ll get her to clarify on Weibo that this matter has nothing to do with you!””

This matter had nothing to do with song Chenyu to begin with.

“Song Chenyu was already feeling very uncomfortable, but now he actually wanted to apologize to ye Zao.”

This was really unreasonable!

“”Yuyan, there’s no need to be like this.”Song Chenyu held Cen Yuyan’s hand. “Isn’t it just an apology? It’s nothing.””

“”Chenyu, you have a good heart and aren’t willing to bicker with Ye Zao, but I can’t!”Cen Yuyan continued, “I must get ye Zao to apologize to you today!””

Then.

Cen Yuyan turned around and left.

“Song Chenyu caught up to Cen Yuyan’s footsteps. “Yuyan, there’s really no need to do this. Fifth Master will definitely be by Miss Ye’s side. If you go over now, what if fifth master takes out his anger on you?””

“Shaoqing is my younger brother! I don’t believe that he would rather help an outsider than an elder sister like me!”

“No matter what, she was Cen Shaoqing’s elder sister.”

She had the same blood as Cen Shaoqing in her bones.

An elder sister was like a mother!

“As long as ye Zao had a brain, then ye Zao should listen to her.”

“As soon as she finished speaking, Cen Yuyan patted song Chenyu’s hand, she continued, “Ye Zao is Shaoqing’s girlfriend. If she wants to marry into our family, she must obtain my approval. Don’t worry, as long as I speak, she will definitely listen to everything I say.””

She was Cen Shaoqing’s elder sister.

It was too late for Ye Zhuo to please her!

So why would he reject her?

Cen Yuyan was very confident in herself.

“From the matter of ye Zhuo moving the air-conditioner clothes for her, it could be seen that ye Zhuo was eager to obtain her approval.”

“Otherwise, ye Zhuo would not have spent so much effort to actually buy the air-conditioner clothes for ZY.”

Therefore.

“As long as she made a move, ye Zao would definitely listen to her obediently.”

Song Chenyu looked at Cen Yuyan’s back and slightly curved her lips.
