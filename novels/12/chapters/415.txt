“Chapter 416: 119: Mu Yourong is in prison, Li Qiandong is repenting, and fifth master is starting his pursuit of his wife! 5”

Translator: 549690339

He ziteng seemed to have already seen Cen Shaoqing’s pursuit of his wife.

The pursuit of his wife was a long and arduous journey!

He did not expect that he would still be able to see Cen Shaoqing pursue his wife in his lifetime.

Life is really too amazing!

Cen Shaoqing hung up the phone and looked up at He ziteng. “What happens after I ask her out?”

“”After?”He ziteng continued, “Does my idol have any special hobbies? For example, what she likes to eat and what she likes to play with! If you want to pursue her, of course, you have to pay attention to what she likes!” ”

“Hearing this, Cen Shaoqing immediately thought of desserts. ”

He had an idea.

Cen Shaoqing picked up his phone and was about to send a wechat message to ye Zhuo.

“Before he sent a wechat message, he looked up at he ziteng and said, “You can go out first.” ”

He ziteng:”...”is this considered killing a donkey without grinding?

Cen Shaoqing started to send a wechat message to ye Zao.

“A minute passed, but ye Zao did not reply. ”

“Five minutes passed, but ye Zao did not reply. ”

“An hour passed, but ye Zao still did not reply. ”

Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly.

What did he ziteng say just now?

He said that ye Zao and song Shiyu went out together.

“In broad daylight, a man and a woman were alone. ”

Where did these two go...

“Cen Shaoqing leaned against the back of his chair, his face dark and gloomy. ”

Could it be that these two were already together?

“The more Cen Shaoqing thought about it, the scarier it became, and his face became darker and darker. He did not even have the mood to count Buddha beads, and habitually began to look for cigarettes. ”

“At this moment, he suddenly remembered that he had already quit smoking. ”

“But now, the person who told him to give up smoking was with someone else. ”

What was the point of giving up smoking?

“Cen Shaoqing found the cigarette case, but in the end, he held it in and didn’t smoke. ”

“At this moment, there was a knock on the door. “Master Five.” ”

“Come in.”

“The moment the secretary pushed the door open, it was obvious that there was something wrong with the atmosphere. ”

Oppression!

It was too oppressive.

“The secretary carefully walked in front of CEN Shaoqing and said, “Master Five, there is a document here that needs your signature.” ”

Cen Shaoqing took the document and began to sign it.

“The Secretary took the document and looked at the signature on party b. a look of embarrassment flashed across his face. He mustered up a lot of courage and said, “Master Five, we are party A.” ”

“After all, he had been by Cen Shaoqing’s side for so many years. Cen Shaoqing was a person who never made mistakes. He was as strict as a robot. ”

Today was really too strange.

“Seeing that the atmosphere was getting more and more oppressive, the secretary became more and more nervous. ”

Oh My God!

Was he going to be fired?

“At this moment, a pleasant voice suddenly came from the air. ”

It was a wechat notification.

“Cen Shaoqing immediately picked up his phone. When he saw that it was a message from ye Zhuo, the corners of his mouth could not help but curl up slightly. He slammed the phone on the table. “Alright, go and print a new document.” ”

“Okay.”The secretary immediately walked out of the door as if he had been granted amnesty.

Cen Shaoqing sat on the chair and started to reply to wechat. [ I know a very good sugar water shop. Do you want to try it together? ]

“Ye Zhuo happened to have nothing to do tomorrow. [ Okay, what time tomorrow? ] ”

[ see you at 10 a.m. I’ll pick you up at Your House. ]

[ Okay. ]

“After the conversation with Ye Zhuo, Cen Shaoqing sent a wechat message to Special Assistant Zhou. ”

He asked him to find the best candy store in Yunjing before he got off work.

Special Assistant Zhou was stunned when he received the message.

Candy Store?

When did Cen Shaoqing fall in love with this?

He checked his wechat account several times.

That’s right!

It was Cen Shaoqing’s account.

There were too many strange things happening day by day.

Cen Shaoqing was in a good mood after successfully meeting ye Zhuo until he got off work in the evening.

“He was clearly in his thirties, but Cen Shaoqing was like a young boy who had just fallen in love at night. He tossed and turned on the bed, unable to fall asleep. ”

“He felt as if something was boiling in his body, as if it was burning. ”

“He finally fell asleep, and Ye Zhuo ran through his dreams for the entire night. ”

“The next morning, CEN Shaoqing woke up at four o’clock. Seeing the wet and sticky sheets on the bed, he raised his hand and pressed his temple. Then, resigned to his fate, he opened the sheets and took them to the bathroom to wash them. ”

“Fortunately, the bathroom was equipped with a dryer. ”

“Otherwise, there was really no way to explain it. ”

“After washing the sheets, he went to the gym next door to exercise. He did not go downstairs to eat until eight o’clock in the morning. ”

“In the end, just as he went downstairs, he was hit by Old Mrs. Cen’s crutch. “Rascal, I’ll beat you to death!” ”

Cen Shaoqing looked up slightly. “Grandma?”

“Zhou Xiang was also shocked. “Mom, why did you hit Shaoqing?” ”
