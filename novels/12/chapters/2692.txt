Translator: 549690339

“Ma Lu really needed a girlfriend. Now, it all depended on whether Zhou Ziyue had the ability to conquer Ma Lu! ”

“If she didn’t have the ability, she wouldn’t be able to implicate others. ”

“Bai Jingshu continued, “How did you and Ma Lu Meet?” ”

“”We went to high school together,”Lin ze replied. ”

“”OH.”Bai Jingshu nodded and continued, “Actually, he’s not a bad person.” ”

“Lin Ze continued, “Actually, Ma Lu didn’t look like this before.” ”

“What do you mean?”Bai Jingshu asked.

“Lin Ze said, “When he was in junior high, there was a car accident that caused his bones to stop growing and his appearance to change.” ”

“”In other words, he didn’t look like this at the beginning?” ”

Lin Ze nodded.

“Do you have a photo?”Bai Jingshu was a little curious about what Ma Lu looked like before.

“I think there’s a group photo.”Lin Ze stood up. “Let me see if it’s still there.”

“Okay.”

“After searching for a while, Lin Ze finally found his old photo album. ”

“This is it.”

In the photo were two young boys who had yet to shed their childishness.

“Bai Jingshu recognized Lin Ze at a glance. “Ah Ze, this is you, right?” ”

“Yes.”

“Bai Jingshu said in surprise, “Then the person standing next to You Is Ma Lu?” ”

“It’s him.”

Bai Jingshu’s face was filled with disbelief.

“In the photo, Ma Lu’s facial features were very delicate, and her skin was also very white. Standing side by side with Lin Ze, she was actually a little taller than Lin Ze. If they had not seen it with their own eyes, perhaps no one would believe that these two people were the same person. ”

“”This, this is really, Ma Lu?” ”

“”Yes.”Lin Ze nodded very seriously. “I developed late. In the first year of junior high, I was less than 1.6 meters, and Ma Lu was already much taller than me. If not for that car accident, he would still be a very handsome man now.”Unfortunately.., a person’s plans were not as good as God’s. A car accident had taken away all of a young man’s possessions. ”

“Lin Ze continued, “At that time, Ma Lu was very hurt. If he wasn’t born in the Ma family, he wouldn’t be here now.” ”

“What do you mean?”Bai Jingshu didn’t quite understand.

“Lin Ze explained, “Ma Lu’s life was piled up with money.” ”

“Bai Jingshu frowned slightly. “Actually, I think there are pros and cons. Ma Lu used to be a bright and handsome man, but now that she has become like this, he must be very upset, right?” ”

“Lin Ze said, “This kind of thing depends on the individual.” ”

Some things were like fish drinking cold water.

“No one was Ma Lu, so no one knew how Ma Lu felt. ”

“You’re right.”

The couple was talking when there was a knock on the door.

Bai Jingshu went to open the door and smiled. “Second aunt.”

“”Jingshu, I didn’t disturb you two, did I?”Ye Sui said as he looked inside. ”

“”No, no,”Bai Jingshu continued, “Second aunt, please come in and take a seat.” ”

Ye Sui followed Bai Jingshu into the house.

“Bai Jingshu brought ye Sui to the outer hall. “Second aunt, please take a seat for a while. I’ll get you some water.” ”

“Ye Sui immediately grabbed Bai Jingshu’s hand. “No, no, I’m not thirsty. Let’s just have a chat today.” ”

“Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded.

“Ye Sui held Bai Jingshu’s hand with a loving look in his eyes. “Jingshu, thank you so much. I heard from Ziyue that the boy you introduced to her is really not bad.” ”

“After saying that, ye Sui continued, “By the way, are you familiar with that boy?” ”

“”I’m not very familiar with him, but Ah Ze is his classmate.” ”

“Hearing that, ye Sui’s eyes immediately lit up. “Really?” ”

“If the boy was Lin Ze’s classmate, then this matter would be even more assured. ”

“Hearing this news, ye Sui was very excited. ”

“”Yes.”Bai Jingshu nodded and continued, “Second aunt, did Ziyue say anything to you when she went back today? Maru had an accident a few years ago, so her facial features might not be so…” ”

“Ye Sui obviously knew what Bai Jingshu was going to say, so he immediately interrupted her, “Jingshu, don’t worry. Our family is not the kind of people who care about appearance. As long as the boy is nice and has a good mind, it’s fine. Oh right, did Ah Ze’s friend ask you about Ziyue’s situation later?” ”

It wasn’t easy for Zhou Ziyue to meet a rich man. She couldn’t let him slip away just like that.

“Bai Jingshu shook her head. “No, Ma Lu is quite busy.” ”

“”I understand.”Ye Sui smiled and said, “After all, it’s a family business. It’s normal to be busy.” ”

Bai Jingshu nodded.

“Ye Sui grabbed Bai Jingshu’s hand and continued, “Jingshu, with your understanding of this little horse, do you think Ziyue’s relationship with him will work out?” ”

“It was not easy to catch a rich husband, and ye Sui was also worried that things would go south! ”

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “I’m not too sure about that either. Second aunt, to tell you the truth, Ma Lu sometimes has a bad temper. I think if Ziyue can get along with him, I think there will be no problem.” ”

“At this point, Bai Jingshu paused, “Ma Lu and Ah Ze are the same age. Seeing that Ah Ze is already married and has children, his parents are actually very anxious. The two of them are very reasonable. For their future daughter-in-law, as long as she is virtuous and obedient, it will be fine.” ”

“Hearing this.., ye Sui smiled and said, “Jingshu, I don’t dare to say anything else. This virtuous and obedient, our ziyue definitely won’t have any problems. She is a teacher herself. In the future, when she has children, she can even teach them herself. She doesn’t even need a tutor!” ”

The most fortunate thing for her now was that she had enrolled in a university for Zhou Ziyue.

“Bai Jingshu continued, “Also, Ziyue has definitely never been in a relationship before, right? You know that some families value this aspect more than others.” ”

“”Don’t worry, don’t Worry!”Ye Sui said with a smile, “Our Ziyue is definitely not the kind of girl who would mess around outside!” ”

“That’s Good!”

“After chatting with Bai Jingshu about some other issues, ye Sui left the room. ”

“After ye Sui left, Bai Jingshu came to the bedroom and asked curiously, “Do you think Ziyue has talked about it this week?” ”

“”90% ,”Lin ze answered. ”

“Bai Jingshu frowned and asked, “Why 90% ?” ”

“Lin Ze looked up at Bai Jingshu and said, “Another 10% is because you don’t trust me.” ”

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “That might not be the case.” ”

“You want to make a bet again?”Lin Ze asked.

“Bai Jingshu immediately waved her hand. “No, no.” ”

On the other side.

“After ye Sui went back, he told Zhou Ziyue to break up with Feng Yang as soon as possible. ”

“Zhou Ziyue was already getting impatient. “I know, I know!” ”

“”You’re just saying that you know. When are you going to make a move?”Ye Sui was very speechless. “I’m telling you, you only get one chance. Don’t do it!” ”

Zhou Ziyue nodded.

“Ye Sui continued, “You can’t do this. You have to break up with Feng Yang Today!” ”

It would be a disaster if he kept making decisions!

Zhou Ziyue was in such a state now.

“Zhou Ziyue looked up at ye Sui and said, “Some things are better said face to face. You Can’t ask me to break up with Feng Yang on the phone, right?” ”

“”Over the phone!”Ye Sui continued, “The phone is meant to provide convenience for humans. Besides, if you ask him to meet you, what if he pesters you?” ”

“He’s not that kind of person!”Zhou Ziyue knew Feng Yang well after being with him for so many years.

“”Then what do you mean? Ask him out and break up with him? But don’t forget, you’re in Beijing now. where is he? He’s at his hometown!” ”

“Zhou ziyue continued, “He came to the capital on business yesterday.” ”

Business Trip?

“Ye Sui looked at Zhou Ziyue and narrowed his eyes. “He can’t be chasing after you, right?”Feng Yang was too scary. He could actually chase him all the way to the capital. ”T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“”No, he’s on business.”Zhou ziyue continued, “How about this, I’ll meet him tomorrow and explain things clearly.” ”

“”Alright, you can decide your own matters.”Ye Sui continued, “I still say, settle it as soon as possible.” ”

“After saying this, ye Sui left the room. ”

“After ye Sui left, Zhou Ziyue called Feng Yang. ”

Feng Yang quickly picked up. “Hello.”

“Zhou ziyue said, “Are you free tomorrow?” ”

“”I was just about to call you. I’m Free Tomorrow,”Feng Yang continued, “Send me your aunt’s address. By the way, this is my first time coming to your aunt’s house. What should I bring?” ”

Come to the Lin Family?

Wouldn’t that expose her?

“Zhou ziyue continued, “Feng Yang, it’s best if you don’t come to my aunt’s house. Let’s go outside.” ”

“Why?”Feng Yang asked.

“He and Zhou Ziyue had met each other’s parents a long time ago. They had already reached the point of discussing marriage. At this moment, Zhou Ziyue and her mother were both living in the Lin family. As Zhou Ziyue’s fiancé-to-be, it was only right for him to come and visit. ”

“Zhou Ziyue sighed, then, she said, “To tell you the truth, my aunt doesn’t like us country relatives very much. If my mother didn’t insist on staying here, I would have left long ago! “You don’t know, but I even feel that the air here is oppressive! “I feel terrible every day! “But Feng Yang, I don’t want to implicate you and me in suffering together!” ”

“Hearing that, Feng Yang frowned slightly. “So, your aunt doesn’t welcome you?” ”

“”Yes,”Zhou Ziyue said. ”

“Feng Yang continued, “How can your family have such relatives!” ”

“Zhou Ziyue sighed again. “It can’t be helped. People will change when they get rich. Their family is a high-class family in the capital, and my mother and I are just poor relatives who came here to fight.” ”

Feng Yang was very angry. He felt that people should not look down on their relatives at any time.
