Ye Sen ate the sweet potatoes while carefully looking at ye Zao.

He was afraid that ye Zao would be unhappy if he forgave Father Zhao so quickly.

“Fortunately, there was no special expression on ye Zao’s face. ”

“He should be... not angry, right? ”

“Father Zhao stood up and said, “Sen, your sister hasn’t been well these few days. I’ll go back first. I’ll bring your sister to see you tomorrow.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Sen nodded.

“Father Zhao turned to look at Ye Zhuo. “Miss Ye, I’ll leave Sen to you and Mr. Xiao Lin to take care of him.” ”

“Lin Ze said, “He’s our uncle. It’s our duty to take care of him.” ”

“Father Zhao smiled and said, “Right, right, right. Look at my brain! A family doesn’t speak in two languages. From now on, we’re all one family. There’s no need to be so polite!” ”

“After waiting for so long, Father Zhao had finally waited for this day. ”

From now on.

“He was ye Zhuo’s grandfather, fifth master’s grandfather. ”

Zhao Xueyin was their little aunt.

The entire Zhao family’s position in the financial world had risen by several levels.

Good!

This was really great!

He wanted to immediately go back and tell Zhao Xueyin the good news.

Father Zhao returned to the villa that the Zhao family rented.

“Zhao Xueyin’s condition had been getting worse over the past few days. Her entire face had ulcerated beyond recognition, and everywhere she went, she was wrapped in a veil. ”

There was no trace of her usual bright and beautiful appearance.

“These days, Zhao Xueyin did not even dare to look at herself in the mirror. ”

She did not know when she had become this inhuman and ghostly appearance.

“”Xueyin.”At this moment, Father Zhao pushed the door open and came in. ”

“Seeing Father Zhao, Zhao Xueyin didn’t even want to respond. ”

“If it weren’t for Father Zhao’s two slaps, she wouldn’t have become like this. ”

“In fact, Father Zhao felt a little guilty for Zhao Xueyin becoming like this. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have thought of letting ye Zhuo treat Zhao Xueyin’s face. ”

“”Xueyin, Father knows that I’ve let you down. Don’t worry, father will definitely treat your face. Then, we’ll return to the financial world in Glory!” ”

“Return?”Zhao Xueyin sneered. “Can we still go back?”

Even the best plastic surgeon in the country said that there was no hope for her face!

A human face.

She would never forgive Father Zhao in this lifetime.

“”You can go back!”Father Zhao continued, “I will let ye Zao personally treat your face. Ye Zao is so powerful, she will definitely be able to cure you!” ”

“”Are you dreaming, or Am I Dreaming?” ”

Zhao Xueyin knew ye Zao too well.

Ye Zao was not the kind of person who had sympathy and a kind heart.

“Now that she had become like this, Ye Zao was probably hiding in a corner gloating over her misfortune. Would he help her treat her face? ”

How was that possible!

“As long as ye Zao had a trace of sympathy, he would not leave her to die and watch her face Fester bit by bit. ”

“Ye Zao clearly knew that her face had become like this, but he did not even show his face. ”

This kind of person was not worthy of being a doctor!

“”Xueyin, there is something that you may not know.” ”

“Father Zhao took a deep breath and continued, “Actually, you have a biological brother who is eight years older than you.” ”

Biological Brother?

Zhao Xueyin widened her eyes and looked at Father Zhao in disbelief.

“Father Zhao continued, “Your brother and I have been separated for more than 30 years. I only found him recently. In the future, our Zhao family will depend on your brother!” ”

Zhao Xueyin’s eyes were filled with self-mockery.

No wonder father Zhao was so ruthless to her!

It turned out that he had an illegitimate child outside a long time ago.

Ridiculous.

It was simply ridiculous!

Zhao Xueyin laughed out loud.

“Ever since she was young, Zhao Xueyin had always felt that she did not lose to any man. ”

But she still lost.

She lost so completely!

“Father Zhao looked at Zhao Xueyin, “Xueyin, don’t be like this! Listen to father tell you that your brother is also ye Zhuo’s uncle...” ”

Ye Zhuo’s uncle?

“Hearing this, Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes. ”

“Father Zhao continued, “Xueyin, think about it. Your Brother is ye Zao’s uncle. Then who are you? And who am I? In the future, does our family have to rely on your brother to carry forward our family?” ”

“Of course, Zhao Xueyin could understand this logic. ”

If that illegitimate child was really ye Zao’s uncle...

Then she would become ye Zao’s Elder!

Therefore.

Ye Zao had to treat her face.

“Not only did ye Zao Want to treat her face, but he also wanted to give her half of the shares of the Shunxi Financial Group. ”

“Thinking of this, Zhao Xueyin’s eyes gradually lit up. “Are you sure that your illegitimate child is ye Zao’s uncle!” ”

“”Of course!”After saying this, Father Zhao realized that something was wrong and continued, “What nonsense are you saying! Your Brother is not an illegitimate child! When you see him tomorrow, you can’t say that, understand?” ”
