Chapter 153: 085: The Smart Lin Ze, the Great Burning Scorch who had just debuted! 5

Working with smart people, there was no need to talk too much nonsense.

Zhao Yang was also a person who understood immediately. He immediately understood ye Zhuo’s intentions. “Alright, Miss Ye. I know what to do.”

Ye Zhuo nodded. “Then I’ll go to school first. If there are any problems, give me a call.”

“Okay.”Zhao Yang sent ye Zao Downstairs. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

When the employees downstairs saw that Zhao Yang had personally sent ye Zao Down and that his attitude was so respectful, they started to discuss animatedly.

“What do you guys think is the relationship between that beautiful young lady and our president? “If it’s really a boyfriend and girlfriend, shouldn’t the respectful person be the girl? “I think our president treats that little girl as if she’s a superior leader!”

“Could it be that that little girl is the legendary Chairman of our company?”

“It’s not quite possible to be the chairman, is it? It’s quite possible to be the chairman’s daughter!”

This little girl looked to be at most seventeen or eighteen years old.

How could she be the chairman!

“Then she is the eldest daughter of Zy Group?”

“It’s very possible!”

Seeing Zhao Yang send ye Zao out of the door and turn around, everyone shut their mouths and began to do their own things.

......

After returning to the company, Zhao Yang got someone to arrange for the contract to be sent to song Shi Group.

Song Shiyu received the contract and let out a soft laugh.

Just then, a young man pushed open the door and entered. Seeing song Shiyu’s expression, he asked curiously, “What’s Wrong?”

Song Shiyu was a very eccentric person.

He didn’t smile easily.

If he smiled, something bad would definitely happen.

This young man was called Bai Jiayu. He was the same size as song Shiyu and was usually close to him.

“Take a look at this.”Song Shiyu threw the contract to Bai Jiayu.

Bai Jiayu took the contract with both hands and said in surprise, “Isn’t this the contract between you and ZY technology company?”

“Yes.”Song Shiyu nodded.

Bai Jiayu flipped through two pages of the contract. “Did they send the contract back?”

“Yes.”

Bai Jiayu rubbed his chin. “Looks like this Zhao Yang isn’t simple! We underestimated him!”

Song Shiyu took out a big white rabbit milk candy from the drawer. “Do you think Zhao Yang Can Tell? Although Zhao Yang is very shrewd, he’s still a greenhorn and has too little experience.”

“Then what do you mean?”Bai Jiayu frowned.

Song Shiyu threw the peeled big white rabbit milk candy into his mouth. “If I’m not wrong, this person is the behind-the-scenes boss of ZY technology company.”

ZY technology company had been established for so long.

No one in the outside world had ever seen the behind-the-scenes boss.

This mysterious boss had made a name for himself and shocked everyone with a single feat. It really made people very curious.

Song Shiyu stood up and walked out.

“Brother Song, where are you going?”

Song Shiyu chewed on the milk candy as he said, “I’m here to apologize.”

“I’ll go with you.”Bai Jiayu immediately followed.

The two of them walked out of the door, and Bai Jiayu went to drive.

In the car.

Song Shiyu took out a large white rabbit milk candy from his pocket.

Bai Jiayu said curiously, “Brother song, when did you fall in love with eating candy? It’s So Sweet!”He remembered that song Shiyu didn’t have such a hobby in the past!

Song Shiyu looked ahead. “Drive your car.”

Knowing song Shiyu’s personality, Bai Jiayu did not waste any time and drove seriously.

Soon, they arrived at ZY Company.

Song Shiyu felt that it was a pity.

He did not meet the legendary ZY boss this time.

After discussing the matter of cooperation, Zhao Yang personally sent song Shiyu downstairs. Seeing the black car disappear on the highway, Zhao Yang could not help but sigh. “Miss Ye is really amazing!”

He had thought that with song Shiyu’s personality, he would not come to apologize.

He did not expect.

Not only did song Shiyu come, but he also came so quickly!

...

On the other side.

Ye Zhuo had just arrived at the school gate when he saw an Lizi and Zhao Pingting waiting for her at the school gate.

A winter vacation had passed.

Zhao Pingting seemed to have changed from a hundred and fifty kilograms to a hundred and eight kilograms!

Her facial features were originally pretty. Now that she had slimmed down, standing next to an Lizi, she looked like two flowers fluttering in the wind.

If one was not particularly familiar with her, one would not even dare to recognize her.

Even ye Zao was stunned for a moment before he ran over. “Lizi, Pingting.”

“Zao Zao!”After not seeing each other for such a long time, the two of them hugged ye Zao excitedly. “I missed you so much, Big Zao!”

“I missed you too.”Ye searing also hugged the two of them tightly.

In her previous life, she had never obtained true friendship.

It turned out that it felt so good to have true friends.
