Li hang stood at the side and looked at Zhou Cuihua. He did not seem to want to stop her. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

What did the rich people fear the most?

They were most afraid of shrews.

“With Zhou Cuihua’s current state, even if she could not threaten Xia Xiaoman, she would at least attract Lin Qingxuan’s attention.”

“When the time came, he would tell Lin Qingxuan about this matter and the affair between Xia Xiaoman and the adulterer. Although they did not have conclusive evidence yet, the detective agency was already investigating. They believed that they would have a result soon.”

“In short, the mother and daughter didn’t have a good life. Xia Xiaoman and an Lizi wouldn’t have a good life either.”

“The Butler stood in the villa and dialed the police. “Hello, there’s someone disturbing the people at 218 Jin Tong Road. It has seriously disturbed our work and rest.””

“Not long after, the sound of sirens suddenly came from the foot of the mountain.”

“Ten minutes later, Li Hang and Zhou cuihua were brought to the police station for investigation.”

“By the time the mother and daughter came out of the police station, it was already evening. Zhou cuihua looked at li hang and said, “Hang Hang, why don’t we go look for your father?””

“They were now penniless, and eating and drinking had become a problem.”

Li hang hesitated for a moment before nodding his head.

“For now, he could only look for Li da long.”

“She was Li Da Long’s daughter. Even if Li Da Long was angry and did not want to pay attention to her, he would not ignore her.”

“Hence, the two of them came to the familiar apartment building.”

“Zhou Cui Hua looked at li hang and said, “Hang Hang, I’ve decided. As long as your father apologizes to me, I won’t hold it against him.””

“After experiencing such a big matter, Zhou Cui Hua had also thought it through.”

“People were not as good as before, clothes were not as good as new.”

“In the future, she would not think about those trivial matters anymore, and she would not easily bring up divorce again.”

“Li hang nodded and said with some worry, “What if dad isn’t willing to apologize?”Speaking up to this point, Li hang paused, then he said, “To tell you the truth, my dad found a new aunt not long after divorcing you.””

“”He was just doing it for me! I’ve been with your dad for so many years, I know him too well!”Zhou cuihua said.”

How could Li da long walk out of the shadow of divorce so quickly.

Absolutely impossible!

“Moreover, they divorced because of a misunderstanding. As long as she explained the misunderstanding clearly, Li Da Long would definitely forgive her.”

“After all, she didn’t really divorce.”

Li hang glanced at Zhou Cuihua and didn’t say anything.

“Things had developed to this point, and Li Hang was completely disappointed with this mother.”

She thought that Zhou Cuihua could really bring her into the upper class.

She did not expect that she would turn into a clown in the end.

“If her friends knew about this, they would laugh at her!”

Especially Zhao Jing!

Li hang wished that Li Dalong would not forgive Zhou cuihua.

“But there were some things that he could only think about in his heart. It was not appropriate for him to say it out loud. After all, Zhou Cuihua was just a commoner. If he really provoked her, she would do anything.”

“Li hang continued, “Let’s go upstairs first.””

“Okay.”Zhou Cui Hua nodded.

The two of them went upstairs together.

“The door was closed. From the outside, everything here was the same as before. Nothing had changed.”

Li hang reached out and pressed the doorbell.

“Very soon, the door opened.”

“However, the person who opened the door was an unfamiliar man. “Who are you looking for?””

Zhou Cui Hua saw that it was a stranger and instantly became anxious. “Who are you? Why are you at my house?”

“The man continued, “You must have the wrong door. This is my house, the House I just bought.””
