[ Miracle Doctor Ye is cheating! ]

“[ what time is it now? Hurry up and inform Miracle Doctor Ye. As long as Miracle Doctor Ye comes, there will be a chance to save the situation! ] ”

“Although Vivi was lying on the operating bed, unable to do anything, her consciousness was surprisingly clear. ”

She even knew how far the operation had progressed.

The operation failed.

What surprised Vivi even more was the reaction of her parents.

A will?

“A monthly salary of 100,000 yuan? ”

“She was about to die. The first thing they thought of was not how to save her life, but how to divide her inheritance. ”

It was ridiculous!

“Fortunately, she had made a plan and handed WANGCAI and Wangfu to the lady boss of the pet shop. If she handed Wangcai and Wangfu to them, she was afraid that the same thing would happen to her. ”

Vivi was disheartened.

“At this moment, she suddenly heard the sound of the door opening, followed by a surprised voice. ”

“Miss Ye!”

“Miracle Doctor Ye!”

Then came the sound of footsteps.

Was Ye Zao Here?

“Vivi tried hard to open her eyes, but she could not open them. ”

“The originally noisy operating theater quieted down at this moment. Looking at the slender figure that was coming against the light, the doctors around the operating bed immediately made way for her. ”

“The person was wearing a dark green surgical gown. A pale blue surgical mask covered her face, and only a pair of delicate phoenix eyes could be seen. Under the illumination of the operating lamp, her long and thick eyelashes were clearly visible. ”

“She walked directly to the operating bed and stood before it. Then, she said, “Prepare the forceps and thread, number three.” ”

The medical assistant on the side immediately handed the things that he had prepared to ye Zao.

Ye Zao did not even turn his head as he reached out his hand to take it. He began to suture the wound that was almost split open. The bright red blood quickly dyed the medical gloves red.

The situation was far more serious than he had imagined. Ye Zao frowned slightly.

“Scissors.”

“Hemostatic forceps.”

“Prepare for blood transfusion.”

“...”

“In the quiet operating room, other than the sound of everyone’s breathing, there was only ye Zao’s faint voice. ”

“Although her voice was very faint, it had a sound when it landed. It also had a kind of magic power that could calm people’s hearts. ”

A pair of eyes shuttled between the wounds just like that.

“Wang Dajun was standing behind her, looking at her with a dull gaze. ”

Could ye Zao really snatch someone back from the hands of the Grim Reaper?

No.

It was impossible.

Weiwei was clearly not malaria.

“Ye Zao would only be like him, losing face in the live broadcast room. ”

He would fail.

This surgery would fail.

“Wang Dajun comforted himself in his heart. He did not realize that at this moment, his entire body was trembling. ”

He felt extremely uncomfortable.

After an unknown amount of time.

Everything returned to calm. The alarm of the ECG monitor disappeared. The ECG data returned to normal!

[ Miracle Doctor Ye Yds! ]

“For a moment, the bullet screen was filled with these words. ”

“The patient’s vitals have returned to normal!”A joyful voice suddenly came from the operating theater.

“”Miss Ye, you’re really amazing!” ”

“For a moment, everyone’s gaze shifted to Ye Zao. ”

“She was wearing a mask, and no expression could be seen on her face. She only said faintly, “It’s all thanks to everyone’s cooperation. Thank you for your hard work.” ”

“After she said that, she continued, “The patient will stay in the operating theater to observe for an hour. Doctor Zhou, Doctor Ma, stay. The rest of you can leave.” ”

“As soon as she said that, everyone was ready to leave. ”

Liu Meilian’s face was still covered in tears. “What do you mean? Is Our Weiwei Alright?” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Xiang Chao was also confused.

He had been so focused on how to divide the inheritance that he did not notice what happened after that.

“However, before they could say anything, they were forcefully taken out of the operating theater. ”

“When Wang Dajun walked out of the operating room, he only felt that everything outside was dark. ”

He did not know why things had become like this.
