“”No.”Allie shook her head and continued, “All kittens love to play. Don’t be too anxious. Maybe it will come back on its own.” ”

“Okay.”

“Although he answered Allie, Ye Zhuo did not stop and continued to walk forward. ”

Ye Zhuo carefully looked for places that brother Meow liked to play.

“Little White said, “It’s no use. I’ve looked through all these places!” ”

Ye Zao was about to go to the 33rd floor to take a look when he suddenly smelled a strong smell of blood.

Ye Zao frowned slightly and walked forward in the direction of the smell of blood.

Until he stopped in front of an office.

“”Big Zao, What’s Wrong?” ”

Ye Zao pursed his red lips slightly and did not say anything. He reached out and knocked on the door.

Pa Pa pa —

One knock after another.

No one answered.

“Just as ye Zhuoluo was about to kick open the door, the door opened from the inside. ”

“”Chief Ye,”Annie opened the door a little. “Are you looking for Miss Zhao? I’m really sorry, but Miss Zhao isn’t here right now.” ” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Let me in.”Ye Zhuoluo’s voice was a little cold.

“Annie gulped. “Miss Zhao is really not here right now! Chief Ye, please don’t make things difficult for me.” ”

“Get out of the way!”

“Annie did not move, “Miss Zhao is really not here!” ”

“Ye Zhuo grabbed Annie by the collar and pulled her out with one hand, then threw her on the ground. ”

“Everything happened too quickly. By the time Annie reacted, she was already thrown on the ground. ”

Whitey went around Annie and followed ye Zhuo inside.

“Zhao Xueyin, who was sitting behind the desk, heard the footsteps and said impatiently, “Didn’t I tell you that I’m very busy right now? ! If there’s anything, we can talk later!” ”

“”Zhao Xueyin, where’s My Cat?” ”

This voice didn’t sound right.

Was It ye Zao?

Zhao Xueyin looked up and saw that it was really ye Zao.

She suddenly saw ye Zao and ye Zao was still questioning the silly cat. This made Zhao Xueyin panic.

“Annie also ran in at this time. “Miss Zhao, I’m sorry. Chief ye insisted on coming in. I Can’t stop him!” ”

“You can leave now.”Zhao Xueyin looked at Annie.

“Okay.”

PA —

The office door was closed.

Zhao Xueyin looked up at Ye Zao. “May I know why Chief Ye is looking for me?”

“Cut the crap. Where’s My Cat?”

“”Cat? What Cat?”Zhao Xueyin continued, “Could it be that chief ye hired me to look after the cat?” ”

“Zhao Xueyin.”Ye Zao looked at Zhao Xueyin. His cold eyes seemed to be wrapped in a layer of cold light. “I’m going to ask you one last time. Where’s My Cat?”

Each word was a shocking one.

It would be a lie to say that she was not afraid.

“Zhao Xueyin tried her best to calm herself down, but she could not. ”

Her entire body could not help but tremble.

“At this moment, Little White’s shriek suddenly came from the air. ”

“Ah!”

Ye Zao looked back slightly.

“Little White pointed at a bloody mess in the corner and said, “Big Zao! Look at this!” ”

“Obviously, the smell of blood that ye Zhuo smelled came from there. ”

“What is that?”Ye Zhuo looked at Zhao Xueyin.

She looked down from above.

“Although she didn’t say anything harsh, and even her voice was faint, it still made Zhao Xueyin feel a strong sense of oppression. ”

She couldn’t breathe.

“How do I know what that is!”Zhao Xueyin tried hard to calm herself down.

“Now that the dead cat’s skin had been peeled off, there was no evidence to prove it. Could it be that ye Zao could still frame her with a false accusation? ”

Who Did ye Zao think she was?

Little B * Tch!

It was simply disgusting!

“”First Seat Ye, may I ask what you are trying to do? If you are here to look for a cat, then I’m sorry, but I don’t have the cat you are looking for! Can you please leave immediately?” ”

“Zhao xueyin paused and continued, “Also, I have to remind you that it’s work time now! Please be serious –” ”

“Before Zhao Xueyin could finish her sentence, her head was pressed against the desk, and her right cheek was pressed against the desk. ”

It hurt.

Zhao Xueyin was on the verge of tears.

“”Zhao Xueyin, I’ve always had a bad temper. I advise you not to challenge my bottom line again and again!” ”

Ye Zao’s voice seemed to be tinged with a layer of ice from the cold winter months. “Where’s My Cat?”

Di Di di di —

“Right at this moment, an electronic sound rang out in the red air. ”

This was the chip that ye Zao had implanted into brother Meow’s body.

“As long as Whitey activated the switch within a meter, the chip would make a sound. ”
