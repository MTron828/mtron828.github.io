Translator: 549690339

Old Mrs. Cen hoped that she could wake up the person in her dreams with a single word.

Unfortunately.

No.

Cen Yuyan treated song Chenyu as her best friend. How could she listen to these words?

“Not only did she not listen, she even felt that old Mrs. Cen was slandering song Chenyu. She was so angry that her face turned pale.”

“Chenyu is not this kind of person!”

How could song Chenyu use her as a stepping stone?

It was clear that ye Zhuo was using old Mrs. Cen as a stepping stone!

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Then let me ask you, why did that ugly fish approach you?””

“”Chenyu did not approach me,”Cen Yuyan continued, “I am good friends with her, and she is not the kind of person who is scheming.””

Looking at Cen Yuyan’s dead face.

“Old Madam Cen wished she could knock her head askew. “If you weren’t the Cen family’s fourth miss, do you think song Chenyu would still bother with you?””

“”She would!”! “Chenyu would!”CEN Yuyan continued, “Chenyu is a very caring girl! Every month, she would donate 1,000 yuan to the children in the poor mountainous areas. She has persisted for several years! If it were anyone else, would they be able to do what Chenyu did?””

Ye Zao knew how to do this?

“Not to mention 1,000 yuan, ye Zao probably had not even donated 100 yuan or 10 yuan!”

“”People who really do good deeds would not publicize it so much!”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Your grandmother donated more than a dozen hope primary schools! Did I say anything? Am I Proud?””

“In detail, Old Mrs. Cen had really contributed a lot to the poor mountain area.”

“It was only 1,000 yuan a month, what was there to say!”

Cen Yuyan felt that old Mrs. Cen was trying to twist the truth.

“”Chenyu’s ability is limited. It’s already not easy for her to keep donating 1,000 yuan a month! “Moreover, she’s a celebrity. A celebrity lives under the spotlight. It’s already very pitiful that Chenyu doesn’t have any privacy, yet you still want to frame her like this!””

Was it song Chenyu who wanted to spread the word?

Song Chenyu was also forced into a corner.

Old Mrs. Cen was really old and blind.

Ye Zao’s money should not be less than song Chenyu’s.

But Ye Zao had contributed to the poor mountain area?

“Yet, old Mrs. Cen was still finding fault with song Chenyu.”

“Fortunately, old Mrs. Cen was already very old this year.”

There were only a few years left.

“Once old Mrs. Cen left, the CEN family would be able to restore peace.”

“Old Mrs. Cen looked at Cen Yuyan, feeling both angry and amused.”

“Thinking of her illustrious reputation, she did not miss out on any bad things. How could she have such a brainless granddaughter?”

“She was impervious to salt and oil, so stupid that she was cute.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

She was sold and still had to count the money for others!

“Thinking of how old Mrs. Cen did not have many years left to live, Cen Yuyan’s tone softened a little. No matter what, she should not be angry at an old man who was about to die.”

“Old Madam Cen’s eyes were blurry from old age. She just had to be more tolerant, “Grandma, I know that you’re doing this for my own good. You’re afraid that I’ll be deceived, but please rest assured that I’m not the type of person who doesn’t have intelligence. I’ve known Chenyu for so many years, and I know her better than anyone else.””

Old Madam Cen looked at Cen Yuyan. “Shut up! I don’t want to talk to You Now!”

“”What’s Wrong?”Cen Yueya walked in from outside. “Fourth girl, why are you angry with Grandma again?””

“I’m not angry with her.”

Cen Yueya smiled. “Look at how angry you’ve made Grandma! You still say you’re not angry!”

“After saying that, Cen Yueya turned to old Mrs. Cen. “Grandma, how did Fourth Girl Offend You? Tell me, I’ll help you beat her up!””

“I can’t even be bothered to talk to her now.”Old Mrs. Cen turned her head.

“Why?”

“Old Mrs. Cen said, “Because Little Luban said that low IQ is contagious! I have to stay away from her!”Old Mrs. Cen might be old, but she was trendy, and she played King’s game six times.”

“However, she only knew how to play Little Luban.”

“Cen Yueya laughed out loud. “Okay, okay, grandma, don’t be angry!””

“Nothing!”Old Mrs. Cen picked up her phone and walked upstairs angrily.

“Looking at Old Mrs. Cen’s back, Cen Yueya turned to Cen Yuyan. “What’s going on?””

“Cen Yuyan shrugged. “Isn’t that what people do when they’re Old? Our Grandma is 83 this year! It’s okay, I understand her! Second sister, don’t worry, i definitely won’t be angry with an old lady!””

“Old Lady Cen was an elder, so she could be insensible.”

But she was a junior.

Why should a junior be calculative with an elder?

“Moreover, Old Lady Cen was already so old, what if she left tomorrow?”

“Who knew who would come first, tomorrow or the accident.”

Cen Yuyan didn’t want to leave behind words that would infuriate her own grandmother to death.
