Chapter 2191: 460: support my younger brother! 2

Translator: 549690339

“Alright.”MAN XING stood up and sent master Cao Out.

On the other side.

“Fan Mu took the name list and found man Wen. He said excitedly, “Brother, you’re really something! You actually made it onto the list!” ”

He had thought that man Wen was bragging.

He did not expect that man Wen would really make it onto the list without anyone knowing.

“Man Wen’s expression was indifferent. “This is just the beginning.”The real drama was still to come. He had thought that the position of candidate should be very simple, but when he went to take a look, he realized that things were not that simple, he had also underestimated the net that Manxing had spread across Manxing. ”

“How many votes did you pull?”Fan Mu asked.

“Man Wen was stunned for a moment. He raised his head and asked, “How many votes?” ”

“”Campaign votes!”Fan Mu continued, “Just being on the roll won’t do! I still have to pull votes!” ”

“”I didn’t pull votes,”man Wen said. ”

“You didn’t pull votes?”Fan Mu asked.

Man Wen nodded.

Man Wen had many interpersonal relationships and it was not suitable for him to expose it now.

Fan Mu frowned slightly. “Then what can you compare with your second sister?”

Man Wen did not speak.

“”Why don’t you go look for Miss Ye?”Fan Mu looked at man Wen, he said very seriously, “Even though the two of you aren’t related by blood, you’ve helped her so much, sent people to protect her, and even helped find Aunt Man! “If it weren’t for you, how could she have found aunt man so easily!” ”

“Now That Man Wen had encountered a problem, ye Zhuo should not sit idly by. ”

“Man Wen said, “I hope that she will never know about the things that I’ve done.” ”

“”Brother, I know what you mean,”fan mu continued, “You just don’t want Miss Ye to know, but now is a crucial time for you. If you have Miss Ye’s help, you will be able to achieve twice the result with half the effort.” ”

“Ye Zhuo was miss ye of the Changyue Kingdom, and Cen Shaoqing was the young master of the Allied Kingdom. ”

“Although these two people did not have any backers, they were the backers of others. As long as ye Zhuo publicly supported man Wen, man Wen would definitely be able to do it! ”

“”There’s no need,”man Wen said. ”

“Seeing Man Wen like this, fan mu shook her head helplessly. ”

“In Fan Mu’s heart, Man Wen was just a stupid and good person. He had clearly given so much for ye Zhuo, but he did not say anything. ”

“Then what if you don’t get elected?”Fan Mu continued to ask.

“There’s still a long way to go.”Man Wen pushed the door open and walked out. “I’ll go out for a while.”

“Silly.”Fan Mu said somewhat helplessly.

“”Brother Man Wen isn’t willing to say it?”After Man Wen left, a young man about Fan Mu’s age walked in from outside. ”

“En.”Fan Mu nodded. “Do you think he’s lacking a brain?”

“The man nodded. “He is indeed a little, but I think there’s something wrong with Miss Ye.” ”

“What’s wrong with her?”Fan Mu asked.

“The man continued, “Could it be that if Brother Man Wen doesn’t beg her, she won’t come and help Brother Man Wen? Although they were no longer related by blood, they were still blood-related siblings after all. No matter what, Miss Ye shouldn’t be so indifferent! Moreover, Brother Man Wen has helped her so much!” ”

“Hearing this, fan mu said somewhat speechlessly, “What does this have to do with Miss Ye? Miss ye doesn’t know that man Wen is his younger brother! Miss ye also doesn’t know that man Wen helped him! Why are you making trouble for no reason!” ” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“”Aunt Man has been hiding outside for nineteen years. If it wasn’t for Brother Man Wen, would miss ye have been able to find Aunt Man?”? Miss Ye was a smart person. She should be able to guess that someone must have been helping in the middle to find Aunt Man! “With Miss Ye’s methods, it shouldn’t be difficult to find out who it is, right! “Perhaps miss ye already found out that Brother Man Wen helped her a long time ago. She just doesn’t want to acknowledge Brother Man Wen!” ”

“Speaking up to this point, the man said indignantly, “To think that Brother Man Wen treats her so well!” ”

Fan Mu frowned. “It shouldn’t be that bad. I don’t think Miss Ye is that kind of person.”

“If ye Zhuo knew about man Wen’s matter, would she just stand by and watch? ”

That was simply impossible!

“”You can’t tell a person’s heart from their face,”the man continued. “However, it’s understandable for miss ye to be like this. After all, Brother Man Wen is the child of the entire family, and the entire family has done things to hurt her. She might be holding a grudge against Brother Man Wen!” ”

“”Holding a grudge against man Wen?”Fan Mu frowned slightly. “That shouldn’t be the case! Man Wen has helped her so much, and the two of them are siblings. Wen Yang, don’t make wild guesses! Miss Ye isn’t the kind of person you’re talking about!” ”

“”Why not?”? Think about it carefully. If Miss Ye really didn’t hold a grudge against man Wen, why didn’t she help man Wen? As the saying goes, accompanying a monarch is like accompanying a tiger. The thoughts of big shots like Miss Ye and the others are the hardest to guess! Who knows what they’re thinking in their hearts!” ”
