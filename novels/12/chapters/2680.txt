“Chapter 2681: 588: nine oxen, not even a hair”

“After saying that, ye Sui continued, “Ah Ze, then you must ask second aunt to take note. Your Cousin is not young anymore. If you delay any longer, she won’t be able to get married.” ”

“Okay.”Lin Ze nodded.

“Ye Sui couldn’t stop praising. “Good, Little Shu. You really didn’t give birth to the wrong son.” ”

Ye Shu’s fate was still the best.

“Back then, she gave birth to a dragon and a phoenix in her lifetime. Her husband’s family was powerful and powerful, and her son was so outstanding. Her daughter-in-law did not seem like an ordinary person. ”

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “It’s only right that their cousins help each other.” ”

Ye Sui nodded. “That’s true.”

“After saying that, ye Sui continued, “Little Shu, why don’t I see Luoluo?” ”

“Ye Shu said, “Burning went to work.” ”

“Is she already at Work Now?”Ye Sui asked.

“Ye Shu said, “Yes, she’s already at work.” ”

“Where does she work?”Ye Sui asked.

“Ye Zhuo was a fool, but he could still work! ”

It was really strange!

It seemed that money could really make the devil push the Millstone.

“”She works in the laboratory,”ye Shu replied. ”

“”OH.”Ye Sui nodded and didn’t ask any more questions. He continued, “I haven’t seen that child, burning! If I met her on the street, I wouldn’t know her.” ”

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “It’s just a coincidence. Something happened in the laboratory. Otherwise, burning would be at home at this hour.” ”

“”No Rush, no rush. I live here. I will definitely see burning,”ye Sui said. ”

“Ye Shu nodded and looked at ye Sui. “Sister, you’ve said so much. Where’s Ziyue?” ”

“”She’s inside. I’ll go get her. Little Shu, brother-in-law, wait for a moment.”Ye Sui walked inside. ”

“Zhou Ziyue sat on the sofa, deep in thought. ”

“”Come out with me for a moment,”ye Sui said. ”

Zhou Ziyue was lost in her own thoughts and couldn’t react in time.

“What are you thinking about?”Ye Sui reached out and patted Zhou Ziyue.

“Only then did Zhou Ziyue react. “Mom, What’s Wrong?” ”

“Ye Sui could also guess why Zhou Ziyue was like this. He continued, “Your uncle-in-law and the others are here. Come out with me to recognize them.” ”

“After saying that, ye Sui continued, “Remember to build a good relationship with your cousin and sister-in-law. As long as they recognize you, they can hook you up with anyone. It’s better than Feng Yang!” ”

“Compared to the sons of noble families, Feng Yang was nothing. ”

“”Mom, I haven’t thought about it yet,”Zhou Ziyue said. ”

“Ye Sui looked at Zhou Ziyue. “Can’t you plan for both? Anyway, building a good relationship with your cousin and sister-in-law won’t do you any harm.” ”

“Got it.”Zhou Ziyue nodded.

“Come out with me.”Ye Sui turned around and walked out.

Zhou Ziyue immediately followed her footsteps.

The two of them walked to the guest room’s living room.

“”Ziyue, quickly call for help.”Ye Sui smiled and said, “This is Auntie, you’ve already seen her this morning. This is your uncle-in-law.” ”

“Zhou Ziyue smiled and called for help, “Auntie, uncle-in-law.” ”

“Lin Jincheng took out the red packet that he had prepared. “Ziyue, right! This is your first time coming to uncle-in-law’s house. You should take this red packet.” ”

“Hearing this, ye Sui said half-heartedly, “Brother-in-law! You’re too polite! It’s fine that we didn’t bring anything with us, but how can we accept your red packet?” ”

“Although ye Sui didn’t intend to reject this red packet, he still had to say the right words. ”

“Lin Jincheng said, “It’s a small red packet. Let the child take it.” ”

“”Ziyue, hurry up and thank your uncle-in-law.” ”

“Zhou Ziyue took the red packet. “Thank you, uncle-in-law.” ”

“You’re welcome.”

“Ye Sui continued, “This is your cousin, Lin Ze. This is your cousin and sister-in-law.” ”

“Zhou Ziyue took the initiative to greet them. “We’re all of the same age. From now on, we can call each other by their names. My name is Zhou Ziyue. You Can Call Me Ziyue.” ”

“I’m Lin Ze.”

“”Cousin, you can just call me Jingshu.” ”

“After getting to know each other, ye Shu said, “Sis, I happen to have nothing to do tomorrow. I’ll bring you and your mother around the nearby scenic spots, okay?” ”

“”Okay.”Ye Sui nodded at her. “Little Shu, I’ll have to Trouble You Then.” ”

“No trouble.”

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “It’s not easy for the two of you to come to the capital to play. This time, you must have a good time.” ”

It’s not easy to come to the capital?

Ye Sui frowned slightly.

What did ye Shu mean by this?

Could it be that ye Shu did not plan to buy a villa for her in the capital?

“Ye Sui smiled and said, “If I can buy a house in the capital, I can live in the capital more often in the future.” ”

“”The capital doesn’t increase anything except the price of the houses.”Ye Shu smiled and said, “Sister, which district do you plan to buy a house in? How much is the down payment?” ”

“Ye Sui did not expect ye Shu to suddenly say this. He was stunned for a moment and then said, “Little Shu, don’t You Still Have You? I’m not very familiar with the capital.” ”

“Ye Shu said, “Then where do you plan to buy a house? Let me help you with your reference?” ”

Ye Shu was too stingy!

She did not leave the word ‘buy’out of half of her sentence. She was already a rich lady now. Why couldn’t she buy a villa for her?

They were biological sisters.

“Ye Sui smiled and said, “Of course, the closer we are to the city center, the better. Your brother-in-law and I prefer villas.” ”

“”As long as we have spare money, it’s better to buy a villa.” ”

“At this moment, Yue Sao carried LIN XI over. ”

“The baby is awake?”Bai Jingshu looked at Yue Sao. “Have you fed it?”

“Little tie Zhu slept with Yue Sao, so Bai Jingshu squeezed the milk out in advance and let Yue Sao feed it. ”

Sister-in-law nodded. “I fed it.”

“Ye Sui looked at the child in sister-in-law’s arms and said in surprise, “This child is... Ah Ze’s?” ”

Ye Shu nodded. “Yes.” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Ye Sui did not expect Lin Ze and Bai Jingshu to even have a child. He continued, “A boy or a girl?” ”

“”A boy,”ye Shu said. ”

“Ye Sui smiled and said, “Ah! Little Shu, Congratulations! You’re younger than me, and you even have a grandchild! Unlike the disappointing one in my family who only knows how to play games all day!” ”

“”Ze got married early,”ye Shu said. ”

“Let me carry him.”Ye Sui reached out to carry the child.

“For some reason, as soon as ye Sui carried him, the originally quiet little iron pillar suddenly burst into tears. ”

Wah Wah Wah —

“”Second aunt, let me carry him.”Bai Jingshu took the child. ”

“Ye Sui smiled and said, “No, no, I’ll carry him. It’s normal for a child to cry a few times. Which family’s child doesn’t Cry?” ”

“Little Tiezhu was still crying loudly, his little face scrunched up. Bai Jingshu’s heart ached terribly, but if ye Sui didn’t give the child to her, there was nothing she could do. ”

Lin Ze frowned slightly and reached out to pick up the child from ye Sui’s hands. “Daddy’s here.”

“Lin Ze’s attitude was a little tough, which stunned ye Sui. ”

“Bai Jingshu felt that the atmosphere was a little strange, so she immediately smiled and stepped forward to smooth things over. “The child is young and a little shy. Let Ah Ze carry him.” ”

“Ye Sui was not embarrassed and continued to ask, “How many months has it been?” ”

“”Just a full moon,”Bai Jingshu replied. ”

“Ye Sui said, “The child is raised really well. He doesn’t look like a child who just had a full moon. I thought he was two or three months old!” ”

The few of them chatted for a while more.

“Lin Jincheng spoke at the right time, “It’s getting late. Let second sister and Ziyue rest early! Let’s not disturb them!” ”

“”Yes, yes, yes. You guys rest early.”Ye Shu nodded. ”

“After Lin Jincheng, Ye Shu, and the others left, ye Sui looked at their backs, his eyes full of speechlessness. “I really didn’t expect rich people to be so stingy!” ”

“Zhou ziyue continued, “Mom, I’m afraid your wishful thinking this time is going to be wrong.” ”

Ye Sui had always wanted ye Shu to pay for her.

But Ye Shu didn’t seem like the kind of person who could be easily manipulated.

“Hearing this, ye Sui snorted coldly. His eyes were full of calculation. “Your Mom, do I look like the kind of person who plans for Nothing?” ”

She wouldn’t come to the capital for nothing.

“Since she was here, she had a way to achieve her goal. ”

“After saying this, ye Sui looked at Zhou Ziyue and continued, “Take a look at how much money is in the red packet.” ”

Zhou Ziyue nodded and opened the red packet.

“”It seems to be 2,888 yuan,”Zhou Ziyue said. ”

“”What? Only 2,000 yuan?”Ye Sui frowned and said meaningfully, “Your uncle-in-law is really generous!” ”

“It was Zhou Ziyue’s first time coming to the Lin family, so she had to give at least tens of thousands of yuan, but Lin Jin city only gave her 2,000 yuan. ”

Two thousand dollars was nothing to Lin Jin Cheng?

It was not even a drop in the ocean.

“”She is quite stingy,”Zhou ziyue continued, “People say that the richer people are, the more stingy they are. With their conditions, two thousand dollars is not a lot.” ”

“After saying that, Zhou ziyue continued, “Mom, I remember you said before that you helped aunt, right? ”

“”If I hadn’t lent her that 300 yuan back then, she wouldn’t be the person she is now. But she has forgotten what happened back then in the blink of an eye. What an ingrate!” ”

“Zhou ziyue said, “She must have forgotten what happened back then!” ”
