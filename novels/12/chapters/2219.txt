Want to bite back?

What a fantasy!

“The judge looked at Manxing and continued, “According to Article 215 of the s galaxy criminal law, those who frame someone with a bad plot shall be sentenced to three to ten years in prison.” ”

“”I didn’t frame Manxing!”Sun Xiaowen heard this and said emotionally, “Comrade judge, everything I said is true! I can swear to the heavens!” ”

“”If swearing to the heavens is useful, why do you need the Court?”Manxing continued, “Sun Xiaowen, don’t put up a desperate struggle!” ”

“”Sun Xiaowen, please show me strong evidence.”The judge continued, “If there is no evidence, you are suspected of framing. Miss Manxing has the right to sue you...” ”

“Before the judge could finish his sentence, a clear voice sounded in the air, “Who said he has no evidence?” ”

This voice...

Was a little cold and familiar.

Everyone looked up and saw that the person who spoke was none other than ye Zao.

Ye Zao had evidence?

She could directly prove that the murderer was man Xing?

Man Xing narrowed his eyes.

Impossible.

All the evidence had been destroyed by her. It was impossible for ye Zao to have evidence!

Man Xing looked at Ye Zao.

She wanted to see what evidence ye Zao could produce.

Ye Zao looked at Leo. “Bring the things over.”

“Okay.”Leo nodded and handed the prepared evidence to the judge.

These evidence were all evidence that full star had destroyed personally.

Every single one of them could cause full star to sink into eternal damnation.

There was also an audio file.

“In the video, full star’s ugliness and evilness were clearly seen. ” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Looking at full star who did not hide anything on camera, the crowd could not help but sigh. ”

“If they had not seen this scene, who would have believed that full star could actually do such a thing? ”

“After all, in front of the public, full star had always displayed his gentle and kind side. ”

“In the video, full star was like a poisonous snake spitting out its tongue. ”

It was especially terrifying.

“How did man Xing do it?”

“How can there be such a vicious woman in the world!”

“Man Xing could not sit still anymore. He stood up from his chair and said hysterically, “It’s fake! I didn’t do this at all. You want to harm me! All of you want to harm me!” ”

“”Who exactly wants to harm who?”Ye Zhuo looked back slightly, “Man Xing, although you have never treated man Wen as a younger brother and even deliberately raised him to become a well-known profligate, he has never had the intention to harm you, but what about you? “Not only can you not tolerate him as a younger brother, you even won’t let go of your biological parents. Man Xing, you are presumptuous as a woman, and even more presumptuous as a sister!” ”

“Hearing these words, the people who were already in a heated discussion became even more heated. ”

“I was wondering why man Wen was such a good-for-nothing. It turns out that man Xing did it on purpose!”

“This kind of woman is too scary!”

“Man family is really unlucky to have such a daughter.”

“I’ve always been very curious about why man Xing indulged man Wen so much. It turns out that he deliberately wanted to raise man Wen to be a cripple!”

“”Actually, I’ve also noticed it long ago, but I didn’t think too much about it. I thought it was just a simple elder sister’s love for her younger brother.” ”

“...”

“”I didn’t! I didn’t!”Seeing her plot being exposed one by one by Ye Zao, man Xing looked at ye Zao and said angrily, “Ye Zao, do you have to ruin my reputation to be happy?” ”

Man Xing was very unwilling.

“Man Wen was ye Zao’s younger brother, but she was also ye Zao’s younger sister. Why did ye Zao always stand on Man Wen’s side? ”

“It was fine if ye Zao did not help her, but now he wanted to frame her! ”

“If it were not for ye Zao’s sudden intervention, she would definitely not be in this state. ”

“If it were not for ye Zao, she would already be the president of Manxing Country, and man Wen would still be the same man Wen from before. ”

It was ye Zao who broke all of this.

“Yet, Ye Zao was still standing at the moral high ground to criticize her. ”

What right did ye Zao have?

What right did they have?

“Ye Zao looked at man Xing and said slowly, “I have never deliberately targeted anyone. Man Xing, you brought this on yourself.” ”

“From the beginning to the end, ye Zao had never thought of taking revenge on anyone. Man Xing had brought this on himself. ”

“If man Xing had not taken the initiative to harm others, he would not have gotten to this point. ”

“However, Manxing still did not know what he had done wrong. ”

How pathetic!

“”You did not harm me?”Manxing’s mouth was full of self-mocking laughter, “If you did not harm me, would I have become like this? If you did not harm me, would you be standing here today? It is all thanks to you that I have become like this! Ye Zhuo, I will not let you off!” ”
