“”Ptui, who are you trying to scare! I’m Not Afraid!”Although she said that she was not afraid, Sun Yu still turned around and ran.”

“In less than a few seconds, her figure disappeared in the middle of the crowd.”

When he looked in the direction where he had disappeared. “Coward.”

“A moment later, she turned to look at Shen Linlin. “Miss Shen, according to the way you picked your boyfriend, you might not meet my criteria for choosing a spouse. I’m sorry, excuse me.””

Not Up to his standards? !

Shen Linlin was speechless as she looked at when he had left. She could not react for a long time.

On the other side.

C nation.

On the third floor of Ranito Casino.

Yaleh looked at the information his subordinate had sent over and frowned.

Three months.

A whole three months!

“Looking at how An’s ranking had risen from second to third on the kill order, the bounty had also risen from eight to nine digits.”

“However, there was no news about An at all.”

This person...

It was as if he had disappeared into thin air.

“Trash! They’re all a bunch of trash!”Yaler threw the information in his hands onto the ground.

“For a moment, the surrounding air became oppressive. His subordinates stood in a row, not daring to speak.”

A moment later.

“Yaler continued, “Bring up the surveillance footage from last time. Let me take a look.””

An assistant immediately handed the tablet to Yaler.

“On the screen, a young girl in white clothes and black pants was sitting in front of the gambling table. She was wearing a hat and sunglasses. In addition, the lighting in the casino was not very good, so only a part of her fair chin could be seen.”

“She was sitting upright. Although her movements were casual, her entire body exuded a noble and elegant temperament.”

He was like a born aristocrat.

This was an aura that could not be imitated. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Yala narrowed his eyes and saw that his speed had slowed down by ten times.

“It was still the same as before. Under the speed of ten times, it was still impossible to tell how she had attacked.”

Knock Knock Knock —

“At this moment, there was a knock on the door.”

“Yala put down his tablet and said, “Come in.””

Hibbert walked in from the door. “Minister.”

“Speak.”Yala turned around.

“Hibbert continued, “Minister, I’ve invited Mr. L. He has a way to slow down the surveillance speed by 20 times.””

“Hearing that, Yala looked up. “Where is he?””

L.

He was a famous hacker in the hacker world.

“However, he had retired from the world for many years.”

“Although he had retired from the martial arts world, the myths about him had never stopped.”

“A man with the same C Nation Face walked out from behind Hibbert. “Hello, Minister Yaler. I’m L.””

“Yaler walked forward and reached out to hold L.’s hand. “Hello, nice to meet you.””

“A moment later, the two of them released their hands.”

Yaler handed the tablet to L. “Can you slow down this video to more than 20 times its original speed?”

“L. took the tablet with one hand. Three minutes later, he returned the tablet to Yala. “It’s done.””

Yala took the tablet.

“Sure enough, there was no problem. After slowing down all her movements to 20 times, the little girl on the screen seemed to have been sprayed with a slow agent. Every movement was extremely slow.”

“But even in such a slow situation, Yala still did not see her attack.”

What was going on?

Who could be 20 times slower and still not see any flaws?

“Yala had been in the casino for so many years, but this was the first time he had seen such a thing. Even he couldn’t make any flaws in such a slow shot!”

It was impossible for someone to sit perfectly.

Unless...

No.

Impossible.

Nine out of ten gambles were faked. How could a Chinese person have any real gambling skills?

After all.

Even he couldn’t do it.

“At this moment, L seemed to see through Yala’s worries and said, “Minister, I’ve just seen it. An’s movements were very smooth throughout the entire process. She didn’t cheat.””

Yana scratched her head. “Is there any way to slow down the surveillance?”

“L said, “This is already the limit.””

“”But there are no gamblers in this world who don’t cheat.”Yala frowned, “One leaf blinds the eyes! There is a saying in China called one leaf blinds the eyes. This girl is from China. She must have used a long-lost method! Find her, you must find her!””

“L smiled faintly and said slowly, “If you want to find her, it won’t be difficult.””

“You have a way?”Yeller turned to look at L.

L turned the ring on his finger into a small screen. On the screen was a seven-inch photo of a person. “This person is called Carl.”
