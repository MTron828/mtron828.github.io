“Just like Mu Yourong, the daughter of the Mu family. ”

“Back then, Mu Yourong only did song Shiyu a favor. ”

“If not, why would song Shiyu remember her for so long? ”

“Unfortunately, Mu Yourong didn’t have that kind of luck. ”

“Hearing this, Old Master Chen frowned. “Do you know what you’re saying?” ”

“”I know. I’m very clear-headed.”Chen Siyao nodded. “Grandfather, I beg you!” ”

“Old Master Chen continued, “The favor I owed him back then was nothing. What’s more, he’s already paid back all these years. You Can’t ask for favors in return.” ”

“Although Old Master Chen was old, he was very clear-headed. He knew what he could and couldn’t do. ”

“”Grandpa, I’m Begging You!”Chen Siyao’s eyes were red, “We’re already at the marriageable age, and I love him so much. For him, I’ll do anything. In this world, no one is more suitable for him than me. Please help me talk to him!” ”

Old Master Chen still shook his head.

“He couldn’t say anything, nor could he throw away his old face. ”

“Grandpa!”Chen Siyao immediately knelt down.

“”Yaoyao, get up quickly!”Old Master Chen said with a frown. ”

“Chen Siyao just knelt on the ground. “Grandfather, I won’t get up if you don’t promise me.” ”

Old Master Chen sighed.

“The Chen family had never had an infatuated child, and Chen Siyao was the first. ”

No one knew who she followed.

“Chen siyao continued, “Grandfather, I beg you to grant me my wish!” ”

“What if Shiyu also rejects me?”Old Master Chen asked.

“Chen siyao said firmly, “No, he won’t! Shiyu won’t reject you!” ”

She knew song Shiyu too well.

“Song Shiyu was a person who knew how to repay kindness. As long as Old Master Chen asked, he would definitely not reject him. ”

“”But there’s always an ‘if’.”Old Master Chen continued, “What if he rejects you? What do you plan to do?” ”

“Chen siyao continued, “Then I’ll Accept My Fate!” ”

The reason why she dared to say that was because Chen Siyao felt that song Shiyu would never reject old master Chen.

“”Okay.”Old Master Chen nodded and continued, “Then I’ll throw away my old face tomorrow and give it a try for you.” ”

It was probably the first time in a wealthy family that a grandfather had personally come to talk to his granddaughter about the big event of her life.

“After all, people from the rich and powerful families valued their reputation. ”

This kind of behavior was directly delivered to their doorstep.

“Hearing this, Chen Siyao stood up excitedly and said with a smile, “Thank you, grandfather!” ”

“Old Master Chen said helplessly, “Don’t be happy too early.” ” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“If he didn’t have only one granddaughter, if song Shiyu wasn’t the grandson-in-law that he thought highly of, he definitely wouldn’t have agreed to such an absurd request. ”

“Chen siyao continued, “Grandfather, when are you going?”This kind of thing had to be struck while the iron was hot. It couldn’t be delayed. Who knew what would happen later. ”

“Are you in such a hurry?”Old Master Chen asked.

“Chen siyao smiled and said, “Grandfather, I’m going sooner or later anyway, so I might as well go tomorrow. Why Don’t You Go Tomorrow?” ”

“If it weren’t for the fact that it was already late and that it wasn’t appropriate to talk about this kind of thing in the afternoon, Chen Siyao would have wanted old master Chen to go now. ”

“Old Master Chen nodded. “Okay, okay, okay. I’ll go first thing in the morning tomorrow.” ”

“Sure enough, the next morning, Chen Siyao woke up to find that old master Chen had already set off. ”

“Chen Siyao had wanted to go with him to take a look, but it wasn’t good to have a girl at the scene, so she didn’t go with him. ”

Old Master Chen arrived at the place where song Shi lived.

“The Butler respectfully welcomed Old Master Chen in and said, “Our boss will be here soon. Please wait a moment.” ”

“Old Master Chen chuckled and said, “There’s no rush. I’ll be fine in a while.” ”
