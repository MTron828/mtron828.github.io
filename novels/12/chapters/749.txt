“Cen Shaoqing looked at master Yu and said, “Master, it’s time for you to cut your hair.” ”

Cut his hair?

Master Yu was stunned for a moment before he realized that Cen Shaoqing was mocking him for having long hair and short knowledge!

“You son of a B * Tch!”Master Yu was so angry that he wanted to hit Cen Shaoqing.

Cen Shaoqing calmly brewed tea.

“The master and disciple chatted for the whole afternoon. In the end, master Yu was unable to persuade Cen Shaoqing to meet his junior sister. ”

Master Yu could only shake his head helplessly.

...

“Although the time for the assessment was getting closer and closer, ye Zhuo was not in a hurry at all. ”

The location of the assessment was C city. They had to leave a day earlier.

Ye Zhuo had a video chat with Cen Shaoqing that night and told Cen Shaoqing about this matter.

“When Cen Shaoqing heard that ye Zhuo was going to C city, he frowned slightly. “What are you going to C city for?” ”

“”I have an exam to take,”ye Zhuo said casually. ”

“CEN Shaoqing then asked, “When will you be back?” ”

“Ye Zhuo said, “Within a day or two after the exam.” ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“After chatting with Cen Shaoqing for a while, the two of them hung up the video call. ”

“Just as they hung up the video call, there was a knock on the door. ”

“Come in.”Ye Zao looked up slightly.

“The next second, the door was pushed open from outside. ”

“An Lizi walked in with a fruit plate. “Zao Zao, do you eat fruit? This cantaloupe and strawberry are really sweet.” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

An Lizi handed the fruit plate over and ye Zao picked up a strawberry.

It was a very authentic snow white strawberry.

It was very sweet.

“An lizi continued, “I heard from fifth uncle and fifth aunt that you have an exam in C city the day after tomorrow?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly. “There is an exam.”

“An Lizi said, “Zao Zao, let me go with you. It just so happens that I can go cheer for you! We can also call Ping Ting!” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Okay! It just so happens that the three of us have not been to C city before. After the exam, we will go to C city to take a stroll.” ”

“Then it’s decided.”An Lizi immediately put down the fruit plate. “I’ll contact Pingting.”

“The next morning, Lin Ze sent ye Zao and an Lizi to the airport. ”

Zhao Pingting was waiting for the two of them outside the airport.

“”Zao Zao, Lizi!”Seeing ye Zao and an Lizi, Zhao Pingting excitedly waved at the two of them. ”

An Lizi hadn’t seen Zhao Pingting for a long time.

“Originally, Zhao Pingting was going to attend Xia Xiaoman’s wedding, but after Zhao Pingting’s mother was hospitalized for a kidney stone, Zhao Pingting had to stay in the hospital to take care of her. ”

“At this moment, an Lizi saw Zhao Pingting again. She was so excited that she wanted to hug Zhao Pingting. ”

“Pingting!”

“Lizi!”

“After a long while, the two of them released each other. Ye Zhuozhuo introduced Lin Ze to an Lizi. ”

“”Lizi, this is my brother, Lin Ze. Brother, this is my good friend, Zhao Pingting.” ”

Lin Ze took the initiative to extend his hand to Zhao Pingting. “Hello.”

“”Hello, Brother.”Zhao Pingting smiled and held Lin Ze’s hand. ”

“Lin Ze smiled and turned to look at Ye Zhuo. He instructed, “The three of you girls must pay attention to your safety when you’re outside. Don’t talk to strangers. Remember to call me when you get there.” ” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded.

“Lin Ze told them something else and said, “You guys go in quickly. It’ll be late later. I’ll go back first.” ”

“”Brother, drive slowly on the road.” ”

“I know.”

“Looking at Lin Ze’s back, Zhao Pingting said in a low voice, “Zao Zao, your brother is so handsome!” ”

“An lizi smiled and said, “Of course. How can the campus belle of Jing University Not Be Handsome?” ”

“Your family’s genes are simply too good!”Zhao pingting gave ye Zao a thumbs up.

The older brother was the campus belle.

The younger sister was the campus belle.

What kind of immortal family was this?

“An Lizi looked at Zhao Pingting with a mischievous smile and continued, “My cousin doesn’t have a girlfriend yet. Do you want me to set you up?” ”

Zhao Pingting patted an Lizi. “What nonsense are you spouting!”

“An lizi smiled and said, “I know, I know! You’re already taken.”Zhao Pingting had a crush on someone since she was a teenager, and the two of them were still developing. ”

“Zhao pingting said emotionally, “Zhonghuo, Lizi, I really didn’t expect the two of you to become cousins!” ”

“Ye zhonghuo smiled and said, “Actually, I didn’t expect it either.” ”

How could she have expected that Lin Qingxuan and Xia Xiaoman would become a family?

“An Lizi put her arms around ye Zhuoluo and Zhao Pingting’s shoulders. “I didn’t expect it either, okay? To be honest, when my mother and uncle Lin were together in the beginning, I somewhat rejected them until I saw Zhuoluo at Uncle Lin’s house!” ”
