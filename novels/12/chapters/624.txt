Old Lady Lin frowned.

She had originally wanted Jiang Suran and Lin Qingxuan to meet at the birthday banquet yesterday.

What a coincidence.

Jiang Suran had missed the birthday banquet because she had something urgent to attend to.

“”Tomorrow, tomorrow you ask Jiang Suran to come over to the house. I’ll think of a way to leave Qingxuan at home tomorrow.” ”

“Okay.”Feng Qianhua nodded.

“Old Madam Lin finished her soup and felt better. She continued, “Qianhua, what time is it now?” ”

Feng Qianhua looked at her watch. “It’s already 1:10 pm.”

“”It’s already so late?”Old Madam Lin continued, “Then I have to get up quickly and make a trip to the CEN family.” ”

The Cen Family?

Feng Qianhua managed to conceal the smug look in her eyes. “What’s the point of going to the Cen Family?”

“Old Madam Lin said, “You don’t have to worry about this matter.” ”

“Feng Qianhua had a kind personality and was aloof from worldly affairs. If she knew that she was going to the CEN family because of Cen Shaoqing and Feng Xianxian, Feng Qianhua would definitely not agree. ”

“These two mother and daughter were people who did not fight for anything. If she did not lend a hand to help them, they would definitely be bullied to death by those people. ”

“First, Ye Shu snatched Lin Jincheng away from Feng Qianhua. ”

“Then, ye Zhuo snatched Cen Shaoqing away from Feng Xianxian. ”

These two mother and daughter.

One was more shameless than the other.

They were men who specialized in snatching other people’s Men!

“After saying that, old Mrs. Lin said again, “Aunt Zhang, go and bring me the set of qipao that I ordered in Little Jiangnan.” ”

“”Okay,”aunt Zhang replied. After a while, she walked in with the Qipao. ”

“After changing into the Qipao, Old Madam Lin sat in front of the dressing table to choose her jewelry. ”

“Although she was old, her jewelry was not less than that of a young person. It was dazzling and dazzling. ”

“”Qianhua, do you think I look better with this pearl necklace or this diamond?” ”

“Feng Qianhua walked over with a smile. “With the Qipao, of course I look better with the pearl necklace.” ”

“Old Lady Lin handed the necklace to Aunt Zhang. Aunt Zhang was just about to put it on Old Lady Lin when Feng Qianhua took the necklace, “Let me help Aunt Lin put it on.” ”

A dark blue qipao paired with a pink and white pearl necklace did indeed look good.

“Old Lady Lin looked at herself in the mirror with satisfaction and said with a smile, “Qianhua has a good eye.” ”

“Feng Qianhua said, “It’s not that I have a good eye. It’s clearly because you have a good foundation. As the saying goes, white hair and a flower lord grim. Time never defeats a beauty. You were a beauty when you were young, but you’re still a beauty now.” ”

Old Mrs. Lin couldn’t close her mouth from Feng Qianhua’s praise.

This was one of the main reasons why she liked Feng Qianhua so much.

“After dressing up, Old Mrs. Lin took a car to the CEN residence. ”

“When she heard that old Mrs. Lin was coming, old Mrs. Cen frowned, “What’s that old fool Bai Tian doing here?” ”

“But when she remembered that old fool Bai Tian was her future granddaughter-in-law’s grandmother, she still went out to welcome her. ”

“Seeing Old Mrs. Cen personally welcome her, Old Mrs. Lin knew that she held a very important position in old Mrs. Cen’s heart. After all, she and old Mrs. Cen were university classmates. ” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Now, there were not many old classmates left in their class. ”

“Quickly make tea for Old Mrs. Lin.”Old Mrs. Cen instructed the servants to make tea.

Old Mrs. Lin sat on the sofa and looked curiously into the room. “Is Xiang Xiang not at home?”

“”She went out for a SPA,”old Mrs. Cen replied. ”

“”OH.”Old Mrs. Lin nodded and continued, “It’s not easy for your Xiang Xiang to stay by herself for so many years.” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen nodded as well. “It’s indeed not easy for the child. I’m not that kind of feudal person. I asked her to find one, but she wasn’t willing.”Cen Haifeng had been gone for more than ten years. ”

“All these years, Zhou Xiang had always been alone. ”

“Old Mrs. Lin continued, “By the way, where’s Your Shaoqing?” ”

“At the company.”

“Old Mrs. Lin deliberated over the words in her heart. “Actually, I came here this time for the matter of Shaoqing and Zhonghua.” ”

“At the mention of Ye Zhonghua, a smile appeared on Old Mrs. Cen’s face. “Fangyue, to be honest, I’ve never admired you in my entire life. The only person I admire is that you have such a good granddaughter! Do you think the ancestral grave of your old Lin family is emitting green smoke?” ”

“Old Lady Cen was filled with envy, jealousy, and hatred towards Old Lady Lin. ”

Good granddaughter?

Old Lady Lin frowned.

Ye Zao called her a good granddaughter?

She suspected that Old Lady Cen was deliberately mocking her.

“Old Lady Lin frowned and continued, “Bai Tang, although Zao Zao is my granddaughter, I will not hide anything for her. To be honest, she is indeed not worthy of your Shaoqing.” ”

“Who do you think doesn’t deserve who?”Old Lady Cen felt that she was hearing things.
