Translator: 549690339

“Zhou Xiang sighed. “Wanyin, your grandmother likes you the most. Please stay by your grandmother’s side and try to persuade her.” ”

“”Yes, I know,”Zheng Wanyin continued, “Second aunt, even if you don’t say it, I will try to persuade grandmother.” ”

“”Okay.”Zhou Xiang could not go to the hospital to see Xie wanqiu, so she could only place her hopes on Zheng Wanyin. “Then I’ll leave it to you, Wanyin.” ”

“From Zhou Xiang’s point of view, she did not want to make a big deal out of this. ”

“After all, they were family. ”

It would be best if they could make a big deal out of it and make a small issue out of it.

Was it not good to have a harmonious family?

They had to make things so tense!

“The crux of the problem now lay with Xie wanqiu. As long as Xie wanqiu came out of the hospital, there would not be any problems. ”

“When she was in the Zhou family, every time Xie Wanqiu had a conflict with Father Zhou, Father Zhou would lower his head and admit his mistake. ”

But Xie Wanqiu did not even look at this place!

This was the CEN family!

Old Madam Cen was not Father Zhou!

They were at each other’s throats.

“When she heard this, Zheng Wanyin said gently, “Second aunt, we are all family. This is what I should do.” ”

“Zhou Xiang continued, “Wanyin, then I’ll leave your grandmother in your care. If there’s a time, just give me a call.” ”

“Okay.”

“After hanging up, Zheng Wanyin put away her phone and walked into the ward. ”

“As soon as she walked in, Xie Wanqiu looked up at Zheng Wanyin and hit the nail on the head. “Zhou Xiang called?” ”

“Zheng Wanyin was stunned and asked in disbelief, “How, how did you know?” ”

“What can you hide from me?”Xie wanqiu knew Zhou Xiang’s personality better than anyone.

“At this moment, Zhou Xiang was probably scratching her ears and cheeks anxiously at home. She did not want to eat or drink, so she tried her best to get ye Zhuo to apologize to her. ”

Xie wanqiu was not blindly confident.

She knew that Zhou Xiang would definitely give in first.

“If Zhou Xiang did not give in, she would call Zheng Wanyin. ”

“Zheng Wanyin nodded. “It was indeed second aunt who called. She asked me to persuade you properly. Grandma, since second aunt has said so, let’s go back.” ” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Go Back?”Xie wanqiu snorted. “Zhou Xiang wants me to go back just like that? No Way!”

“Zheng wanyin said awkwardly, “Grandma, are you really going to ask cousin-in-law to apologize to you?” ”

“Do I look like I’m Joking?”Xie wanqiu asked back.

“After that, Xie wanqiu continued, “Also, I’ll say it again. Don’t call cousin-in-law ye Zao in the future. She doesn’t have the right!”Besides, Cen Shaoqing was about to dump ye Zao! ”

“”Grandma, why do you have to be so calculative with a Junior?” ”

Xie wanqiu looked at Zheng Wanyin. “Do you think that everyone is you and doesn’t care about anything?”

Zheng Wanyin didn’t say anything.

Cen residence.

“After hanging up on Zheng Wanyin, Zhou Xiang went downstairs to eat. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen was sitting on the sofa with her legs crossed and reading the newspaper. “Xiangxiang, you’re up.” ”

“”Mom.”Zhou xiang smiled and said, “Why are you alone? Where’s Shaoqing?” ”

“Usually, at this time, Cen Shaoqing would sit at the dining table and eat. ”

“Today, he actually didn’t see Cen Shaoqing. ”

“”In the dessert room,”old Mrs. Cen said. ”

“Dessert Room?”Zhou Xiang asked.

“Old Mrs. Cen turned a page of the newspaper. “According to the housekeeper, he seems to be studying what is called Mu Xue’s dessert.” ”

Zhou Xiang immediately understood.

Ye Zhuo loved sweets as if his life depended on it.

It was easy to understand why CEN Shaoqing wanted to study desserts.

“Zhou Xiang continued, “Mom, do you think Shaoqing wants to personally make desserts for Zhuo Zhuo to eat?” ”

“Is there a need to ask?”Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said.

“”Make desserts?”Zhou Xiang narrowed his eyes. “Mom, why did Shaoqing suddenly think of making desserts for Zhuo Zhuo to eat?” ”

“”Do you need a reason for that?”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Of course, it’s because of the couple’s relationship!” ”

“Although Cen Shaoqing looked cold, he was actually an infatuated person. ”

“To be precise, the CEN family were infatuated people. ”

They would do anything for the love of their lives.

“”Really?”Zhou Xiang did not think so. “Mom, when we were reading novels and idol dramas, when the difficult man proposed, where did he hide the proposal ring?” ”

Old Mrs. Cen reacted at this time. “You mean that the fifth girl is going to propose?”

“”It’s very possible!”Zhou Xiang nodded, then, she said, “But it’s also strange. Isn’t burning still researching aircraft carriers? Why did Shaoqing suddenly decide to propose? Besides, burning said before that he would consider the wedding after graduation!” ”
