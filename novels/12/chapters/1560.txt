“So that’s why you guys are here!”

“Old Madam Lin said impatiently, “Zao Zao, tell us, did that Zhang Qingqing use some tricks? The child in her belly isn’t Ah Ze’s, right?” ”

Ye Zao nodded slightly. “You’re right!”

Old Madam Lin spread her hands. “Look! I told you! I told you long ago that there’s definitely something wrong with that woman! She wants our Ah Ze to take over as an honest person. Why is she so wishful thinking!”

“Ye Shu said in disbelief, “Zhonghua, have you investigated everything?” ”

“”Yes,”ye Zhonghua continued, “Zhang Qingqing was kept by someone a year ago. By the way, do you know who kept her?” ”

Ye Langhua frowned.

Kept...

This was too disgusting!

“Old Madam Lin asked curiously, “Who is it?” ”

“”Wu Youyu,”ye Zhuo answered. “According to the time calculation, the child in her stomach should be Wu Youyu’s.” ”

“”Wu Youyu?”Ye Shu said in disbelief, “It’s... It’s Xie Wanqiu’s lover?” ”

“A while ago, the matter of Zhou Xiang’s stepmother had been blown up so much that it even made the news. Of course, Ye Shu knew about it. ”

But she did not expect that Zhang Qingqing was also one of the time protagonists.

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

Ye Shu’s heart was in turmoil. She did not understand why Lin Ze would be entangled with such a woman.

“”Zao Zao, you just said that the child in Zhang Qingqing’s stomach was Wu Youyu’s, but wasn’t Wu Youyu already dead for more than two months?”Ye Shu continued to ask. ”

What she was most afraid of now was that the child in Zhang Qingqing’s stomach was really Lin Ze’s.

That was too disgusting!

“Ye Zao continued, “That was because she bribed the doctor to do something and changed her report to one month pregnant. Actually, she’s already two months pregnant.” ”

“”Shameless! This is too shameless!”Old Mrs. Lin almost couldn’t control herself, “Zao Zao, it’s fortunate that we have you! Otherwise, our Lin family would be ruined by this snake-hearted woman! And Ah Ze, ever since this incident happened, your brother has become a completely different person! Oh right, we have to quickly tell your brother about this, lest he can’t sleep at night.” ”

Ye Zhuo nodded. “I’ll go tell my brother right now.”

“”Go, go, Go!” ”

“After learning that the child in Zhang Qingqing’s stomach was not Lin Ze’s, the few of them felt much more relieved. ”

“After a while, Ye Shu turned to look at Lin Jincheng. “You have to apologize to AH ze properly! I told you, our Ah Ze is not that kind of person! Who would be like you, hitting the child without any reason!” ”

Lin Jincheng’s slap made ye Shu’s heart ache.

“Yes.”Lin Jincheng nodded. “I know.”

“You have to apologize to the Child Tomorrow!”

“Don’t wait for tomorrow. I’ll go in a while!”Lin Jincheng said.

“”That’s more like it,”ye Shu said. ”

Upstairs.

Ye Zhuo told Lin ze everything that had happened.

“Hearing this, Lin Ze’s expression gradually became lively. He turned to look at Ye Zhuo. “Zhuozhuo, are you serious?” ”

“”Of course I’m serious. Actually, nothing happened between the two of you that night. I’m already looking for evidence! Don’t worry, brother. That child has nothing to do with you at all!” ”

“Lin Ze was so happy that he cried. He hugged ye Zao and said, “Zao Zao, Thank You!” ”

“”Brother, what are you talking about!”Ye Zao said with a smile. ”

“Ye Zao stayed in the room to chat with Lin Ze for a while. Then, Lin Jincheng came up. He came to apologize to Lin Ze. “Ah Ze, I’m sorry. It was dad who wronged you. Dad shouldn’t have hit you without clarifying the matter!” ”

“”Dad, I don’t Blame You,”Lin Ze said. ”

“Lin Jincheng looked at Lin Ze and felt that this child had grown up a lot in an instant. He had matured a lot, then, he said, “AH ZE, you must remember that before you can give a girl happiness, you must never do that to her! You’re a man. You can just throw your arms around and leave. But it’s the girl who’s harmed!” ”

“Okay.”Lin Ze nodded.

“It’s good that you know.”Lin Jincheng reached out and patted Lin Ze’s shoulder.

“After saying these words, Lin Jincheng went downstairs. ”

“In the blink of an eye, it was the next day. ”

“The Zhang family’s parents and Zhang Lei came to Beijing, and Zhang Qingqing personally went to the airport to pick them up. ”

“When they saw Zhang Qingqing, the Zhang family’s parents’faces were all smiling like flowers. Now, they saw that Zhang Qingqing was no longer Zhang Qingqing. She was clearly a glittering wealthy lady, the ancestor of the Zhang family. “Qingqing! Qingqing!” ”

“Mom and Dad!”Zhang Qingqing ran over.

“Mother Zhang said nervously, “Be careful! Be careful, you’re carrying a child in your belly!” ”

“”Look at how nervous you are!”Zhang Qingqing smiled and said, “It’s fine!” ”

“What if something happens! The child in your belly is very precious!”Mother Zhang held onto Zhang Qingqing’s arm.

“Zhang Lei said, “Qingqing, where’s your boyfriend? Why didn’t he come with you to take advantage of the situation?” ”

“Father Zhang said, “He’s the young master of the Lin Corporation! Can he come out to pick me up?” ”

“Zhang lei snorted, “So what if he’s the young master of the Lin Corporation? He’s still going to marry my sister!” ”

“”That’s true!”Father Zhang was in high spirits when it came to happy events. He walked with his head held high. After all, he was about to become the father-in-law of the LIN Corporation’s young master! In the future, who else in the capital would be more noble than him? ”

“Mother Zhang looked at Zhang Qingqing and continued, “Qingqing, your father, your brother, and I have traveled thousands of miles from home. How can our future son-in-law not show up? call him and tell him to come over immediately!” ”

“Zhang Qingqing had the Lin family’s flesh and blood in her belly. Now, it was not they who were begging the Lin family, but the Lin family who was asking them! ”

“Zhang Qingqing nodded and said, “I’ll call him right now!” ”

“As she said that, she took out her phone and made a call. ”

“She thought that Lin Ze would answer the call right away, but a busy voice came from the other end of the phone. ”

Zhang Qingqing frowned. Did Lin Ze blacklist her? Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

It shouldn’t be!

“Zhang Qingqing called again, but the other end of the phone was still busy. ”

“Zhang Qingqing frowned and called an Lizi again, but an Lizi was still on the phone. ”

“Just when Zhang Qingqing was anxious, an Lizi called. ”

“Lizi!”

“Don’t talk! Listen to me!”An Lizi sounded very anxious and angry.

“Before Zhang Qingqing could react, an lizi continued, “Zhang Qingqing! You disappoint me. I treat you as my best friend, and you lie to me like this! How can you be so Shameless!” ”

“Lizi! When have I ever lied to You?”Zhang Qingqing suddenly had an ominous feeling in her heart.

“”When have you ever lied to me?”An lizi sneered, “I know everything! I know everything! The child in your stomach is not ah ZE’s at all!” ”

“”Lizi, I don’t know what you’re talking about!” ”

“”You don’t know what I’m talking about! Then you should know who Wu Youyu is! Zhang Qingqing, you disgust me!”After saying that, an lizi hung up the phone with a snap. ”

“Zhang Qingqing’s face instantly turned white, and the strength in her body seemed to be sucked away at that moment. ”
