Translator: 549690339

“Hearing this, the assistant nodded. “Alright, I’ll immediately contact lawyer Shangguan.” ”

“With that, the assistant asked hesitantly, “Miss Ye, do you really want to go to the intergalactic court to do a paternity test on the spot?” ”

“Based on the current situation, if ye Zhuo really went to do a paternity test, it would confirm the fact that she was unfilial. ”

The S galaxy also emphasized filial piety.

“If things continued to develop at this pace, the situation would be very unfavorable for ye Zao. ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“The assistant continued, “But if we really do this, once the paternity test relationship is established, Miss Ye, you...” ”

“Once the personal relationship was confirmed, then Manxing country would definitely exploit ye Zao to the end. ”

“At that time, ye Zao would not even be able to justify himself. ”

“Ye Zao put down his Teacup and said with a smile, “I know what I’m doing.” ”

“Hearing what ye Zao said, the assistant did not say anything more. ”

“Since ye Zao was so powerful, she should have a corresponding countermeasure in her heart. Otherwise, she would not be so confident. ”

“At this moment, footsteps came from outside the door. ”

“Father Zao!”

“Miss Ye!”

“The footsteps were getting closer and closer. Before long, JY team members, Leo, Mr. Feng, and others walked in from outside the door. ”

“”Father Zao, we already know about the matter in Manxing Country.”Leo threw the AX on the desk, he said angrily, “Leave this matter to us brothers. Father Zao, you don’t have to worry! I guarantee that Manxing country won’t even dare to Fart!” ”

“With just Manxing Kingdom, he still wanted to bully ye Zhuo! ”

He simply couldn’t stand it.

“Ye Zhuo looked up slightly. “Everyone, I appreciate your kindness, but I want to resolve this matter myself.” ”

The matter between her and Manxing kingdom had to be resolved in the end.

“However, it wasn’t by relying on force or backing. ”

He could convince people with reason.

“Under such circumstances, only reason could convince the masses. ”

“If she wanted to resolve it through other methods, CEN Shaoqing would have long been unable to restrain himself. ” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“The reason why CEN Shaoqing was able to remain calm was because of her words, which was why he did not cause trouble for the Manxing Kingdom. ”

“Leo saw through Ye Zhuo’s thoughts and continued, “Burning Father! Why are you trying to reason with people like the Manxing Kingdom! Besides, you don’t even need to personally handle such a small matter! You have so many things to attend to every day, how would you have the time to deal with such a matter?” ”

Leo spoke quickly and could not hide the matter in his heart. The first thing he thought of when he encountered a problem was to use force to suppress it.

A small country like Manxing could be solved with a single finger of his!

“Mr. Feng smiled and said, “Since Miss ye knows what’s going on, we’d better not interfere.” ”

“After saying that, Mr. Feng raised his head to look at Ye Zao. “Miss Ye, if there’s anything you need from us, you must speak up in time.” ”

“Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Yes, I will.” ”

“Leo continued, “Father Zao, do you really not need our help?” ”

“I really don’t.”

“One of the members of the JY team, MO jiiran, said, “Miss Ye, I heard that Zhao Dan wants to go to the galactic court to do a paternity test in person. What if the paternity test is established?” ”

“”Don’t worry, it won’t be established,”ye Zao said. ”

“Really?”Mo Gilan asked.

Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“She was ye Zao now, and her biological mother was ye Shu. How could the paternity test be established? ”

“Leo was a little puzzled, “Since the paternity test is not established, why are you still wasting so much time with them, Father Zao? Why Don’t you just issue a paternity test?” ”

“”I still have other things to deal with,”ye Zao said. ”

“She originally did not want to care about Manxing anymore. After the matter was over, so be it. Who knew that they would actually shamelessly come looking for her. ”

“Since that was the case, she naturally had to pay them back several times over. ”

Didn’t Manjiangshan and Zhao Dan like to tarnish their parents’image?

Then she would let their true colors be exposed under the sun.

“”Oh right,”ye Zhuo seemed to have remembered something and continued, “There is one thing that I might really need your help with.” ”

“”What is it, Miss Ye? Feel free to tell me,”Mr. Feng said. ”

“Ye Zao continued, “Help me investigate someone.” ”

“Who?”Leo asked.

“Ye Zao said, “Li Man.” ”

“Who is Li Man?”Leo was a little puzzled.

“Ye Zao explained, “Li Man is a nutritionist for the full moon. After the full moon disappeared, Li Man also disappeared.” ”

“As the person involved, Li Man definitely knew the whole story clearly. ”

“Mr. Feng seemed to know something and nodded. “Okay, Miss Ye. Don’t worry. We will definitely help you find this person in the shortest time possible.” ”
