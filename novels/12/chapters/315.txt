“Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and continued, “By the way, what do you want to eat in the morning?” ”

“You know how to Cook?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows.

“CEN Shaoqing said, “There are sandwiches and milk in the fridge. Just heat them in the microwave. If you don’t want to eat sandwiches, there are also buns and eight treasures porridge.” ”

Ye Zhuo hesitated for a moment. “Then I’ll have the sandwiches and milk.”

“Okay.”

“Then I’ll go for a run first.”

“Go ahead.”

“At six o’clock in the morning, the air on the island was very good. The sea breeze was gentle and accompanied by the chirping of birds. It made people feel relaxed and happy. ”

The island was not very big. It would take about an hour to run one lap.

Ye Zhuo began to jog around the island.

The island was not only beautiful but also rich in products. Ye Zao even saw a few wild rabbits and wild goats on the road.

Little Fat Sheep! ?

The mutton was very delicious to begin with.

The wild goat had not eaten any feed and was walking around the mountain. The taste would definitely be more delicious.

“Ye Zao seemed to see roasted lamb chops, braised mutton, spicy mutton, and roasted mutton leg waving at him. ”

The lamb chops that were roasted until they were golden and crispy were dripping with oil in one mouthful.

He was drinking a mouthful of spicy and sour lamb vermicelli soup.

The taste was simply too beautiful!

“Ye Zao swallowed his throat, and his footsteps could not help but slow down. He quietly hid behind a tree and began to calculate how to catch the little fat lamb. ”

Catching it alive would definitely not work.

“After thinking about it, ye Zao still decided to give the little fat lamb a quick death! ”

“Thus, Ye Zao found a very round stone on the ground and aimed at little fat sheep’s head. ”

Whoosh!

Bang!

“The stone hit little fat sheep’s head and fell to the ground. He closed his eyes and stomped his four feet, leaving just like that. ”

“Ye Zao walked over and directly carried little fat sheep on his shoulders, walking quickly into the villa. ”

“The whole process was smooth and smooth, without even a frown. ”

Cen Shaoqing was about to go out for a walk.

He saw ye Zao’s figure.

“Moreover, he was carrying a huge object on his shoulder! ”

What was that?

A sheep?

Cen Shaoqing was stunned. He even thought that he was hallucinating.

Didn’t he go out for a run?

Why was he carrying a sheep back?

That fat sheep weighed at least a hundred pounds!

How did she carry it?

Ye Zhuo looked at Cen Shaoqing excitedly. “Fifth brother! Guess what I’m carrying?”

“A sheep?”

“”Yes!”Ye Zhuo continued, “This little fat sheep is really fat. It’s also wild, so it’ll definitely be delicious when it’s made into grilled lamb chops and fat lamb rolls! Unfortunately, you won’t be able to enjoy it.” ”

Cen Shaoqing twirled the prayer beads. “Did you catch this sheep?”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “I happened to run into it.”

Cen Shaoqing really didn’t expect ye Zao to be able to catch a sheep.

Cen Shaoqing was in a high position.

“Every year, countless daughters of wealthy families would come close to him. ”

He had seen all kinds of women.

But this was the first time he had seen someone like ye Zao.

This was the first time he had seen someone like ye Zao.

“No matter what time it was, she always had an indifferent look on her face, as if she didn’t care about anything at all. However, she was able to display her skills in various fields, and she could do whatever she wanted. ”

She lived freely.

She did whatever she thought of and didn’t care about the gazes of others.

Ye Zhuo carried the fat sheep to the backyard and found a knife and a few utensils that could be used to store lamb meat.

Cen Shaoqing followed her to the backyard.

Ye Zhuo looked up at Cen Shaoqing. “You should leave for a while.”

“Why?”Cen Shaoqing was a little puzzled.

“Ye Zhuo picked up a sharp knife. Under the sunlight, the edge of the knife shone with a sharp and cold light. “Because the next scene will be a little bloody.” ”

“You want to dissect it?”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“CEN Shaoqing said, “Do you know how to do it? Let a professional do it.” ”

“”That’s it? It’s no big deal.”With that, Ye Zhuo raised the knife and cut a bloody mark on the mutton belly. Then, he swiftly peeled off the mutton skin. ”

“It was clearly a very bloody thing, but Cen Shaoqing saw a peaceful harmony in his body. ”

Ye Zao raised his eyes slightly. “Aren’t you going to avoid it?” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“You’re not even afraid of a little girl. Why should I avoid it?”Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddha beads.

“But aren’t you a vegetarian?”Ye Zao said.

Cen Shaoqing’s tone was indifferent. “I’m just taking a look. It’s no big deal.”

“Then go to the kitchen and bring a big plate over. I want to remove the best part of the Tenderloin.”

“Okay.”

Cen Shaoqing turned around and walked to the kitchen.

Ye Zhuo was probably the first person who dared to order Cen Shaoqing around like that.

“However, Cen Shaoqing did not feel that anything was wrong. ”

“After taking the plate, CEN Shaoqing asked, “Is there anything else you want to take?” ”
