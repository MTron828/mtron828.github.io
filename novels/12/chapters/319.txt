Mu Yourong was very confident.

But Big Soldier Mu felt that this matter was somewhat unreliable.

That was ZY technology company! Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“There were many enterprises in Yun Jing that wanted to cooperate with ZY, but unfortunately, ZY did not even look at those small enterprises. ”

“Currently, ZY was cooperating with the song group, the emperor of Yun Jing. ”

Mu Yourong wanted a share of the song group..

This seemed rather unlikely.

“Big soldier mu continued, “Yourong, Father knows your ability, but that is ZY after all. I heard that a few days ago, the Zhang Group brought a proposal to work together, but in the end, I didn’t even see Zhao Yang!” ”

The Zhang Group was much larger than the MU group!

Their status in cloud capital was only second to the song group.

But even the person-in-charge of the Zhang Group couldn’t see Zhao Yang.

“Moreover, Zhao Yang was only a professional CEO, but he was elusive. ”

“Moreover, the person that Mu Yourong wanted to see was ZY’s behind-the-scenes boss! ”

“Seeing that soldier Mu was so worried.., mu yourong continued, “Dad, I never do things that I’m not prepared for. To tell you the truth, I have a proposal that can interest ZY’s behind-the-scenes boss! As long as he sees this proposal, he will definitely cooperate with us!” ”

“Speaking up to this point, Mu Yourong paused. “Words have no basis. Please wait for me here for a moment. I will go and take down the proposal. You will understand after seeing it.” ”

“After saying this, Mu Yourong walked upstairs. ”

“Shen Rong looked at Mu Yourong’s back and consoled, “Old Mu, don’t be anxious. Our Yourong is so powerful. If she says it will work, it will definitely work!” ”

“In Shen Rong’s heart, her daughter was the most outstanding young miss of the entire cloud capital, a phoenix that roamed the nine heavens! ”

The other vulgar fans simply could not compare to Mu Yourong!

What was a tiny ZY in her daughter’s eyes?

Zy would sooner or later become a thing in Mu Yourong’s hands!

“Not long after, Mu Yourong came down with a document in her hand. ”

“Mu Yourong handed the document to soldier Mu. “Dad, take a look at this.” ”

Soldier Mu took the document and turned to look at the servant. “Go and bring my glasses over.”

The servant immediately brought the glasses over.

“Soldier Mu wore his glasses and carefully looked at the plan. The expression on his face changed from calm to disbelief, and finally to shock! ”

Unbelievable!

It was really too unbelievable!

Big Soldier Mu had never thought that Mu Yourong would have such a business talent.

As expected of big soldier Mu’s breed!

No Wonder Mu Yourong was so confident.

It turned out that she had such an advanced plan in her hands.

ZY Group was originally focused on future high-tech.

This plan was simply tailor-made for ZY Group.

“With this plan, soldier Mu would not only stop cooperating with the MU group! ”

“When the time came, they would not be the ones begging ZY! ”

ZY would be the one begging them!

Soldier Mu was very excited. “Y-yourong! You’re the mastermind behind this plan?”

“Mu Yourong nodded. “Yes, this plan was the result of me staying up all night for a week.” ”

Staying up all night for a week?

“If it was an ordinary person, how could they have such perseverance? ”

“Hearing this, Shen Rong’s heart ached terribly. “Yourong! It’s been hard on you. Why didn’t you tell Mom in advance? ! Mom will send you supper every night!” ”

“Mu Yourong shook her head. “It’s not hard at all, Mom. As long as I can help dad and our MU group, I won’t have to work hard at all.” ”

Shen Rong and soldier Mu were extremely touched.

Their biological daughter was still the most outstanding!

How could that Little Bastard ye Zao be able to do it?

“Soldier Mu stood up from the sofa. “Good! This is really too good! With this plan, we won’t have to worry about ZY not cooperating with us anymore!” ”

“The corners of Mu Yourong’s mouth curled up into a smile. “Dad, my goal isn’t just to cooperate with Zy.” ”

She wanted to make ZY corporation’s behind-the-scenes boss fall in love with her.

Fall in love with her!

Only then would ZY corporation spare no effort to support her.

“At that time, the Mu Corporation would stand out in the business world of Yun Jing! ”

“In a television series, wouldn’t the female lead be surrounded by several male leads and two male leads who were willing to give their all for her? ”

She would be even more dazzling than the female lead in the television series!

“With this thought in mind, the smile on Mu Yourong’s face deepened. ”

“Soldier Mu had already seen Mu Yourong’s abilities, so he naturally would not doubt her. He walked over and patted her shoulder, “Yourong! Daddy believes in You! Daddy believes that you will definitely bring glory to our MU group! Right, when are we going to ZY Group?” ”
