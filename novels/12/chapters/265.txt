Translator: 549690339

Advanced lung cancer.

It was no different from a death sentence.

“Even if she was hospitalized, it would only cause more pain and waste money. ”

Zhao Pingting touched her hair.

Even if she died.

She wanted to die pretty.

She didn’t want to become bald because of chemotherapy.

People die.

It was nothing.

Zhao Pingting comforted herself in her heart.

Zhao Pingting forgot how she got out of the hospital.

She only felt that her hands and feet were extremely heavy.

“It was a clear and bright sky, but in her eyes, it became gray. ”

“In the end, Zhao Pingting could not hold it in. ”

She just squatted on the street where people came and went.

She wailed loudly.

“People came and went, and they looked at her curiously. ”

“An old granny handed her a piece of tissue. “What’s wrong, Young Lady? Did you encounter some difficulties?” ”

“Zhao Pingting took the tissue. “Thank you, I’m fine.” ”

“The old granny smiled and said, “Young Lady, life will always encounter such difficulties. Don’t be afraid. As long as you face them head-on, these difficulties will be resolved one day.” ”

Will It?

It Won’t.

Her difficulties will never be resolved.

“The old lady continued, “Think of your parents, think of your relatives. If they see you like this, they will definitely feel sorry for you...” ”

“Zhao Pingting wiped her tears. “Thank you, I know what to do.” ”

She had just asked the doctor.

She still had three months left in her life.

“She wanted to make good use of these three months to spend time with her family, and then go to visit the great rivers and mountains of the motherland. ”

She couldn’t come to the human world for nothing.

Zhao Pingting returned home and found out all the pocket money she had saved all these years and the New Year’s money.

“There was a total of 30,000 yuan. ”

“After getting the money, she immediately went to the mall. ”

She bought a silk qipao for her mother that she had liked for a long time but had been reluctant to buy.

Her father liked to drink.

He kept talking about maotai.

Zhao Pingting bought a bottle of Maotai.

Then her brother.

Her brother had mentioned that he wanted a big-brand suit.

Zhao Pingting knew her brother’s size and went to buy the suit again.

Then her sister-in-law.

Zhao Pingting’s sister-in-law was a very beautiful girl. She often talked about some big-brand skincare products.

“There were four gifts in total, and they cost 28,000 RMB. ”

“There was still 2,000 RMB left. ”

“After shopping, she went home. ”

Zhao Pingting went to the market again. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

She was going to cook in the evening.

“Zhao Pingting had been able to cook since she was young, but she rarely did anything since she entered high school. ”

In the evening.

“When Zhao Pingting’s parents, brothers, and sisters-in-law came home and saw a table full of food, they were very surprised. ”

“”Mom, did you get off work early tonight?”Sister-in-law Tang Jia looked at Mother Zhao. ”

Mother Zhao shook her head. “No! I just got home too!”

“After saying that, mother Zhao turned to look at Father Zhao. “You made this?” ”

“Father Zhao said in a speechless manner, “Didn’t I come home with You?” ”

“Could it be handsome?”Tang Jia frowned slightly. “But handsome also came home with me!”

“At this moment, Zhao Pingting came out of the kitchen with the fish soup in her hands. “Dad, Mom, sister-in-law, you’re back! There’s only one more dish left to start the meal. By the way, where’s My Brother?” ”

The family members were all stunned.

They all looked at Zhao Pingting in disbelief.

“Like all young people, Zhao Pingting was very lazy. She would never stand when she could sit and would never sit when she could lie down. ”

“Ever since Tang Jia married into the family, she had never entered the kitchen. ”

“Usually, if mother Zhao did not have time to cook, she would order takeout. ”

“”Little sister, did you cook this table of dishes?”Tang Jia asked. ”

“Zhao pingting nodded. “Yes. Sister-in-law, you haven’t eaten my dishes, right? try them later to see if they taste good.” ”

Tang Jia felt a little confused.

“Father Zhao said with a gratified expression, “Our little slob has finally grown up!” ”

“Mother Zhao smiled and said, “Pingting! You just finished your college entrance exam. Remember to rest well. Mom will get off work early. Mom will just come back and cook for you.” ”

“”Mom, you guys have worked hard at work. I’ve already grown up. From now on, I’ll Cook for you guys every day!” ”

Mother Zhao was so happy that she wiped her tears.

She was really touched that her daughter was so sensible.

Seeing her mother like this.

Zhao Pingting felt very guilty.

She regretted not being sensible earlier. Her life was about to come to an end. How many more days could she be filial to her parents?

“When Zhao Yingjun parked his car and went home, he was also shocked. ”

“After cooking the last dish, the family sat in the dining room and began to eat. ”

Zhao Pingting’s mother picked up a chicken leg and gave it to Zhao Pingting. “Pingting has worked hard today. This chicken leg should be given to Pingting.”
