“Su Zishan continued, “Uncle Zhou, if there’s nothing else, I’ll take my leave first.” ”

Director Zhou nodded.

On the other side.

Gu dening went to the office to sort out the information and was prepared to hand over the matters at hand to another doctor.

“”Sister Sun, I’ll have to trouble you with these patients.” ”

“Doctor Sun took the documents. “Little Gu, have you really decided to bring team a?” ”

“Yes.”Gu dening nodded.

“Doctor sun continued, “Curing cancer? I think this matter is too mysterious! Even the experts in country P can’t do anything about this disease. What right does a 19-year-old girl have?” ”

“Gu dening smiled and said, “Sister Sun, even the hospital director trusts Miss Ye so much. This means that miss ye must be extraordinary!”Gu Dening’s grandfather had died of cancer. From then on.., her wish was to be able to cure cancer with her own hands one day. ”

This was also the reason why she wanted to study medicine.

“Doctor Sun looked around, he lowered his voice and said, “Xiaosu is a relative of director Zhou’s family. Even Xiaosu isn’t willing to lead group A. What does this mean? It means that this is something that I’m not sure of! “If that little girl really has the ability, do you think xiaosu would give up such a good opportunity to you?” ”

Su Zishan was usually very high-profile because she had studied abroad and had a nepotism relationship with director Zhou.

No one else could be involved in anything good in the hospital!

“Gu decing continued, “Maybe Dr. Su made a mistake.” ”

“Dr. Sun shook his head helplessly, “Xiaosu, why didn’t you listen to me? !”! Although the patient’s family had signed a waiver, it was still a human life after all. What would you do if something went wrong and the patient insisted on blaming you? Our industry can not tolerate a single stain! Xiao Gu, you have to think it through!” ”

“Gu dening said very seriously, “Don’t worry, Dr. Sun. Since I’ve taken this step, I’m prepared to fail! I’m willing to give it my all for this!” ” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The winner takes all.

Life was a gamble.

“Dr. Sun frowned and said, “You child, aren’t you joking about your future?” ”

“Gu dening looked at her watch and said, “There’s not much time left. I Won’t talk to you anymore. I’m going downstairs to look for Miss Ye.” ”

“Looking at Gu Dening’s back, Dr. Sun Sighed. ”

The other doctors in the same department were gloating.

“”I think Gu Dening is a little silly! She’s rushing up to things that others can’t avoid! Sooner or later, she’ll Cry!” ”

“She must be crazy to want to be famous! She actually believed the nonsense of a little girl!”

“”If the surgery fails, the patient’s family members might make a scene!” ”

“I heard that she signed a disclaimer.”

“”In front of human lives, what’s a disclaimer?” ”

“That’s true! Sigh! I’m afraid gu dening won’t be able to get up this time.”

No one believed that ye Zao could cure cancer.

Everyone was waiting to see Gu Dening and ye Zao make a fool of themselves.

Gu dening didn’t care at all about what others thought of her.

She just needed to do her best.

“Not long after, Gu dening arrived at Zhao Pingting’s ward. ”

“In the ward, the other patients were all asleep. ”

Zhao Pingting and an Lizi were playing games.

“Gu dening said in a low voice, “Sorry to bother you, is Miss ye around?” ”

“Zhuozhuo went to the bathroom. Please wait a moment.”Zhao Pingting raised her head slightly. Yes

“Okay.”Gu dening nodded.

“After a while, the bathroom door was opened. ”

A slender figure walked out from inside.

“She was wearing a cap on her head, so her facial features couldn’t be seen clearly. ”

“Seeing ye Zhuozhuo come out, Zhao pingting hurriedly said, “Zhuozhuo, this doctor is looking for you.” ”

“You Are Miss Ye?”Gu dening walked to ye Zao’s side.

“Ye Zao nodded. “Hello, May I know who you are?” ”

“Gu dening extended her hand to ye Zao. “Hello, Miss Ye. My name is Gu Dening. I’m the team leader of Project A and will be your assistant in the future. If you need anything, feel free to let me know.” ”

“I’m Ye Zao.”Ye Zao shook her hand. “Happy working with you.”

“Nice working with you.”

“GU dening continued, “By the way, Miss Ye, let me take you to the temporary office to take a look.” ”

“Ye Zao nodded. He turned around and told Zhao Pingting and an Lizi that he cared about them. Then, he left with Gu Dening. ”

“Although the office was temporary, it was not particularly simple. ”

“After walking around the office, ye Zao asked, “Do you have wechat?” ”
