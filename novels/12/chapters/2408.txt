Translator: 549690339

“Irene was so frightened that her face turned pale as she called out, “Jerry! Jerry!” ”

“Hearing the shouts from upstairs, Jerry quickly ran over. “What’s Wrong!” ”

“Irene’s voice was trembling. “Quickly look at mom, What’s wrong with Mom!” ”

“Jerry smiled and said, “It’s nothing, you don’t have to worry.” ”

“Hearing that, Irene looked at Jerry in disbelief. She didn’t understand why Jerry was so cold-blooded. ”

This was their mother! ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Jerry! What are you talking about?”Irene continued.

“Jerry walked over, picked up Susan, put her on the bed and covered her with the blanket. Then he said, “Mom is really fine. She’ll only sleep for a day at most.” ”

“Sleep for a day?”Irene asked.

“Jerry nodded. “Since mom insists on going back, I can only use my own method to keep her.” ”

“Irene finally understood what Jerry meant and continued, “Is there a problem with the glass of water?” ”

“”Yes.”Jerry did not hide it and said, “I put sleeping pills in it.” ”

“No Wonder.”Irene was relieved.

“At this moment, the sound of a car horn came from outside the house. ”

“Uncle Joseph is here. Let’s hurry down!”

“Irene nodded and asked as they went downstairs, “Why is Uncle Joseph Here?” ”

“Jerry said, “He’s here to pick up mom.” ”

“Irene was not worried about Joseph at all. After all, Joseph was much easier to talk to than Susan. ”

“When the two of them came downstairs, they realized that Irene had come with Joseph. ”

“Are you done packing?”Elena asked.

“Jerry walked over. “We’re not going back, Uncle Joseph. My mom is not feeling well. You Don’t have to go back. Stay and take care of her. When she’s better, you can go back.” ”

“When he heard that Susan was not feeling well, Joseph immediately got out of the driver’s seat. “What happened to Your Mom?” ”

“Joseph had fallen in love with Susan at first sight since he was young. Later on, when Susan got together with someone else, he was never married. Later on, Jerry’s father had an accident and left, so Joseph and Susan naturally got together. ”

“Jerry continued, “Her old habit is acting up again. She has a severe dizziness, so it’s not suitable for her to take a car for the time being.” ”

“Joseph asked, “Then where is she?” ”

“She’s resting upstairs.”

“Joseph immediately said, “I’ll go up to see her.” ”

“”Uncle Joseph, Wait a moment.”Jerry pulled Joseph’s sleeve and continued, “My mother took sleeping pills and finally fell asleep. Why Don’t you not go up to disturb her for the time being?” ”

“I see.”Joseph nodded. “Then I’ll go up later.”

“Elena stood to the side and said somewhat disappointedly, “So we’re not going back now?” ”

“Joseph continued, “Your aunt isn’t feeling well. Let’s wait a few days before going back.” ”

Nothing was more important than Susan.

“”Let’s talk inside,”Jerry said as he walked in, he said, “Actually, it’s not a bad thing for us to have such a thing happen. The current situation in L continent isn’t stable. Once something happens, we’ll never be able to come back.” ”

“Elena smiled and said, “Cousin, don’t be alarmist! You said that Dr. Mario would definitely regret it, but who would have thought that he would be able to build the perpetual motion machine in the blink of an eye! “Do you know how many countries have signed cooperation agreements with our L continent? “Let’s take the chance to go back now and get a share! “If we go back too late, we won’t get anything!” ”

“”You’re thinking too simple,”Jerry said. ”

“Elena pursed her lips. “You’re thinking too complicated! It’s fine if you guys don’t go back, I’ll go back first.” ”

“With that, Elena stood up from her chair. ”

She didn’t want to go back at first.

“But seeing her good friends go back one by one and make use of the current situation to make a fortune, how could she hold back? ”

She had to go back immediately!

“Elena!”Jerry called out to her from behind.

“What’s Wrong?”Elena turned around.

“Jerry continued, “I’ve seen Dr. Mario’s experimental subject with my own eyes. I know how terrifying it is. Don’t go back. You’ll really regret it.” ”

“Elena smiled and said, “I know you’re thinking about me, but I have to go back.” ”

“”Then have a glass of water before you leave,”Jerry said. ”

He wanted to use the method of keeping his mother to keep Elena.

“However, it was not that easy. ”

“Elena was a very smart person. When Jerry suddenly asked her to drink water, she knew that things were not simple. She smiled and said, “I’m not thirsty, I’ll leave First!” ”

“After saying that, she turned around and left. ”

“Jerry looked at Elena’s back, his eyes full of helplessness. ”
