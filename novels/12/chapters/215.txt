“”It can definitely be put back. Otherwise, why would I dismantle it?”Ye Zao’s voice was shallow as she continued to move her hands. ”

“She lowered her eyes slightly and her fair fingers bypassed the cold and hard parts, forming a beautiful scenery. ”

“Ye Sen suddenly realized that if this niece of his were to be serious, she would seem to be quite serious. ”

“Of course, if she wasn’t bragging, she would look even more like a real person! ”

“”Zhonghua, what are we having for lunch?”Ye Sen continued to ask. ”

“Ye Zhonghua thought for a moment and said, “Let’s order takeout. I want to eat cold noodles.” ”

“”Okay, then we’ll have cold noodles for lunch! I’ll go and order takeout. After lunch, we’ll take a break and then return to the company.” ”

“Okay.”

“Ye Sen went to the living room and ordered takeout. After that, he went to the shopping website and prepared to buy a new cleaning robot. ”

“Although ye Zao said that she would reassemble the robot, Ye Sen did not believe that she could really reassemble the pile of junk into a cleaning robot! ”

“In order to prevent ye Zao from causing trouble to the newly bought robot, Ye Sen prepared to buy a better quality robot that was not easy to dismantle. ”

“Just as he selected the robot, there was a knock on the door. ”

Ye Sen walked over to open the door.

It was the delivery guy.

“”Hello, is this Mr. Ye?” ”

“”Yes, it’s me.”Ye Sen nodded. ”

The Delivery Guy handed the takeout to ye Sen. “This is the takeout you ordered.”

“”Thank you.”Ye Sen took the takeout, closed the door, and placed the food on the dining table. ”

“Two servings of cold noodles, one fried chicken, and one fried peanut. ”

“”Sear, come out for dinner.” ”

“Coming.”

“Ye Zao responded, but she didn’t come out immediately. It was not until ten minutes later that she slowly walked out of the room. ”

“”Sear, do you want to drink orange juice or cola?” ” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Ye Sen raised his head and was immediately stunned. He was so scared that he stuttered, “What... What is that thing?” ”

“A strange cylindrical object about half a meter tall followed behind ye Zao. It didn’t look good, and the top was emitting a blue light, making a slight biu-biu sound. ”

“”I’m not a thing! I’m Whitey, the cleaning robot! I’m happy to serve you!”The cylindrical object made a mechanical sound. ”

It could actually talk!

Ye Sen was shocked.

“Whitey continued, “Master, is there anything you can ask Whitey to help you with?” ”

Ye Sen looked at Whitey in shock. He could not believe that this ugly thing was actually a robot!

“He then said, “The kitchen is too dirty. Go clean it up.” ”

“Okay.”

Whitey received the Order and slid towards the kitchen.

“Looking at Whitey’s back, Ye Sen looked at ye Zao and said in disbelief, “Zao Zao, how did it know where our kitchen is?” ”

“Ye Zao drank a mouthful of coke. “When I was writing the code, I saved the layout of our house into it.” ”

Coding?

Saving the layout of the house?

“Ah?”Ye Sen did not understand what ye Zhuo was saying.

“At this moment, little white walked out of the kitchen and said, “Reporting to master, the kitchen has been cleaned and the trash has been thrown into the trash can. Is there anything else that needs to be cleaned?” ”

Holy shit!

It was cleaned up just like that?

“Ye Sen said in surprise, “You even know how to throw out trash? It’s so advanced!” ”

“Xiao Bai said proudly, “Yes, master! That’s how advanced he is! He is the smartest cleaning robot in the entire universe!” ”

The smartest cleaning robot in the entire universe?

Ye Sen raised his eyebrows. Why did this proud look and narcissistic tone sound so familiar?

“”He can still understand me!”Ye Sen raised his head and looked at Ye Zao. “Zao Zao, where did you buy this robot?” ”

Ye Zao’s expression remained the same. “I assembled it with the one at home. Didn’t you see it just now?”

What?

Ye Sen thought he was hearing things.

“”The one at home?”Ye Sen said in disbelief, “Are you sure?” ”

Ye Sen had also bought the robot from before.

“It cost 3,000 yuan. ”

“Although it was also intelligent, it only had the sensing function and the ability to clean repeatedly. It could not speak, could not take out the garbage, and could not understand human language. ”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded. “It’s the one you bought before.”

Ye Sen walked to Whitey in disbelief and looked it up and down.

“Obviously, this was not the cleaning robot he bought before. ”

“”The one at home didn’t seem that big, right?”Ye Sen asked. ”

“Ye Zhuo pulled out a drumstick from the fried chicken. “Yes, the one before was too short and didn’t exist, so I processed the paint bucket and iron sheet that I didn’t want at home.” ”
