“Xian ‘er gulped and said hesitantly, “Can we add you on wechat?” ”

“She had known ye Zhuo for a few days, but Xian ‘er did not dare to take the initiative to use ye Zhuo’s wechat. She was afraid that ye Zhuo would reject her. ”

“After all, she and Ye Zhuo were not from the same world. ”

“Sure.”Ye Zhuo took out his phone. “I’ll scan you.”

“Okay!”

Xian ‘er was very excited. She immediately took out her phone and opened the QR code.

“After ye Zao scanned the QR code, he clicked to add her as a friend. ”

Xian ‘er’s side passed the friend verification and gave ye Zao the Goddess title.

“”Goddess, let’s keep in touch in the future.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Although neither of them said it explicitly, ye Zao already understood Xian ‘er’s choice. ”

“After Xian ‘er returned from the piano room, Ye Zao sat in front of the zither and continued to practice. ”

“This time, it was a famous piece of music. It was an ambush from all sides. ”

“From slow to urgent and then from urgent to slow, the connection between the two was handled very well. It made people sink into it and unable to extricate themselves. ”

“Yu Shaoqing stood on the balcony in his twilight years, listening to the sound of the zither. His expression was unclear. ”

“In the past, he felt that Cen Shaoqing was very pitiful. He was already so old, yet he had not even tasted the taste of love. ”

“Now, it seemed that the clown was himself. ”

“After Xian ‘er returned to her room, she sat in front of the dressing table and put on a peach blossom make-up for herself very seriously. ”

“Her make-up skills were very good. In less than an hour, a beautiful and natural peach blossom make-up was completed. There was not a single blemish on her exquisite make-up. ”

“Then, she put on lipstick. ”

“Since it was peach blossom make-up, it was not suitable for lipstick that was too red. She had to choose a light pink. ”

“This kind of pink was different from the death Barbie Powder. It was a very clear and refreshing pink. Together with the smooth makeup, it was very eye-catching. ”

“After putting on her makeup, Xian er went to the kitchen and instructed the kitchen to prepare a western meal. ”

“Although Xian er was only a female companion in her twilight years, in the Yu family, she still had the respect that she should have. ”

“Soon, it was evening. ”

Xian ‘er sat at the dining table and looked like she was in her twilight years.

The exquisite steak and the’82 Lafite made Xian ‘ER’s face look even more charming under the dim candlelight.

“The more she looked at the beauty under the lamp, the more hazy she became. ”

Yu Mumu walked in from outside and saw this scene. His eyes were slightly dazed for a moment.

“Young Master Yu.”

“Yu Mumu looked around and then said, “Just the two of us?” ”

“Yes.”Xian ‘er nodded. “Miss Ye went out to eat at the food stall.”

Perhaps this was the charm of Ye Zhuo.

“She could eat a Michelin feast that could easily reach five or six digits, or she could eat the spicy hot pot, Guan Dong’s cooking, and the food stall by the roadside. ”

“Yu Niannian walked to Xian ‘er and sat down. He smiled and said, “Is today your birthday?” ”

“No.”Xian ‘er shook her head.

“Yu sunset continued, “Then what are you doing?” ”

“”Romantic.”Xian ‘er continued, “It can also be considered a farewell candlelight dinner.” ”

“Farewell?”Yu sunset looked at Xian ‘er with a smile in his eyes.

Xian ‘er was a canary that he raised his appetite with his own hands. How could such a canary leave a big financier like him.

“”Yes.”Xian ‘er looked at Yu Mumu. “Young Master Yu, My Goddess is right. A woman’s greatest charm is to rely on herself.” ”

Rely on herself?

Yu Mumu heard this and laughed out loud.

“Xian ‘er, the canary that relied on him for food and clothing, actually told her that she wanted him? ”

Was she joking?

“”Don’t laugh,”Xian ‘er said seriously. “I’m very serious now.” ”

She would use her actions to tell Yu Mumu that she was not joking.

Yu Mumu would also see her hard work one day.

“”Good, good, good.”Yu Mumu smiled and said, “I believe that you can definitely rely on yourself!” ”

“Xian ‘er knew that Yu Mumu did not believe in her, but she did not point it out. ”

Facts speak louder than words!

Xian ‘er cut the steak carefully and then switched with Yu Mumu.

“Yu Mumu took a bite of the steak and smiled as he looked up. “Look, these actions have already become your habit. You even told me that you have to rely on yourself.” ”

Fawning over him had become Xian ‘er’s daily routine.

“Xian ‘er looked at Yu Mumu and continued, “Young Master Yu, in your eyes, I should only be one of your many female companions, right?” ”

Yu Mumu chewed on the steak and did not say anything.

Because there was nothing much to say. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

This was the truth.

“Xian ‘er drank a mouthful of red wine. “There is something that you have never known, and I have never thought of telling you, but today is the day of departure. I don’t want to hide it anymore.” ”

“Speak.”Yu sunset raised his head.
