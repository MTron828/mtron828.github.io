Translator: 549690339

“In fact, Xia Xiaoman was very gratified when she saw this scene.”

What was the most frightening thing about reorganizing a family?

“Adults were disharmonious, and children were also disharmonious. Therefore, there were many misfortunes in life, and most of them appeared in reorganizing families.”

This was also the reason why many adults gritted their teeth and persevered through no matter how unfortunate their marriage was for the sake of their children.

“Actually, before they remarried, Xia Xiaoman had also been worried about this. It was an Lizi’s constant comforting and encouragement that allowed her to open her heart and truly accept Lin Qingxuan.”

Reality proved that she and an Lizi’s judgment was not wrong.

Lin Qingxuan was a good father and a good husband. He did not neglect an Lizi just because of Little Lin’s birth. He also did not treat an Lizi badly just because an Lizi was not related to him by blood. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Xia Xiaoman smiled and said, “You’re already twenty-three, not thirteen.””

“Lin Qingxuan continued, “Whether it’s twenty-three or thirteen, in the eyes of parents, they are all children.””

“An lizi smiled and said, “My father is very right.””

“You two are father and daughter.”Xia Xiaoman smiled and shook her head.

“Little Lin Zhi opened the ice cream. “Sister, let’s eat together. You have a bite first.””

“Okay.”An Lizi nodded and took a bite of the ice cream.

“Xia Xiaoman continued, “You just said that your aunt has left. Where is Hang Hang Now?””

“Life was actually just a dream. There was no obstacle that could not be overcome, and there was no resentment that could not be overcome. If Li Hang was homeless now, as his aunt, she could help him.”

“”She’s staying at her uncle’s house now,”an Lizi said.”

“That’s good.”Xia Xiaoman nodded.

Lin Qingxuan looked at Xia Xiaoman curiously. “Where did your cousin go?”

“Xia Xiaoman said, “She left in a car accident.””

“She died?”Lin Qingxuan was very surprised.

“Yes.”Xia Xiaoman nodded.

“Although Lin Qingxuan did not like Xia Xiaoman’s cousin very much, he was still quite surprised to hear that she had died.”

“”This is too sudden.”Lin qingxuan sighed and continued, “That’s why people should do good deeds.””

It was always right to say that good deeds were rewarded for good deeds.

“Zhou Cuihua was too calculative and scheming, which was why she had come to this point.”

“An Lizi said at this time, “After this incident, Li Hang has changed a lot. He’s also very different from before.””

“At this point, an lizi paused and continued, “She’s a smart person. As long as she puts her mind on the right path, her future will not be too bad.””

“Putting everything else aside, Li Hang was indeed very outstanding. Her high education and ability to deal with the world was not fake.”

“Xia Xiaoman nodded, then, she said, “Actually, the reason why hang has become like that is mostly because of the influence of her mother. Children are just a blank sheet of paper. Parents are the first teachers. Some children are not influenced by their original families, but some children will be influenced by their original families for the rest of their lives.””

Lin Qingxuan nodded in agreement.

“Xiao Lin Zhi seemed to understand but not understand. “Then, what kind of person will I become in the future?””

“Xia Xiaoman smiled and said, “Who do you want to become?””

“Xiao Lin Zhi immediately made a pose and said in a dignified manner, “I want to become Ultraman to protect the earth and all mankind!””

“Yes.”Lin Qingxuan nodded. “That’s a good ambition. Daddy will support you.”

The family of four was very happy.

...

“Time passed very quickly. In the blink of an eye, another four months had passed.”

“The Lin family had been very busy these few days, especially ye Shu. She had put down all her work and spent time with Bai Jingshu.”

“Because Bai Jingshu had already reached her due date, it was only in these few days. However, her stomach had yet to move.”

“Seeing that ye Shu was so nervous, Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “Mom, quickly go to work! You Don’t have to spend time with me. There are so many servants at home. I’ll be fine.””

“”Outsiders are outsiders after all. It’s better for me to stay with you.”Ye Shu had experienced the change of children in her early years, so she had a little shadow in her heart, “You’re right about Ah Ze. How can he still be in the mood to go on a business trip at a time like this? He really doesn’t have the awareness of being a father!””

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “Mom, don’t blame Ah Ze. This has nothing to do with him. I was the one who asked him to go on a business trip. He wasn’t the one who gave birth to my child. Besides, I don’t feel anything at all now. Who knows when I’ll give birth? I Can’t let him waste his time staying at home with me.””
