Translator: 549690339

Ye Shu was already busy grilling the fish.

“An hour later, the meal was ready. Ye Shu said, “Zhuozhuo, call your uncle to come back for dinner.” ”

“Lin Ze continued, “Uncle said that he has something to do today, so he won’t be coming back for dinner tonight.” ”

“Then let’s eat first.”Ye Shu carried the grilling plate and walked out.

The five-kilogram silver carp was especially fragrant when it was roasted.

“Ye Shu smiled and looked at song Shiyu. “Little song, it’s just a normal meal. Don’t stand on ceremony and eat as much as you like.” ”

“Lin Jincheng followed, “Yes, yes, yes. Don’t stand on ceremony.” ” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“”Thank you, uncle and Auntie.” ”

This was probably the most heartwarming meal song Shiyu had ever eaten.

“Before this, he had never eaten such delicious roasted fish, nor had he ever felt such warm kinship. In the Ye family, it was as if he had seen the other side of the world. ”

“For the first time, song Shiyu ate two bowls of rice in one go. ”

“After the meal, song Shiyu said goodbye, “Thank you for your hospitality today, uncle and Auntie. If you have time, you must come visit our song family.” ”

“”Okay.”Lin Jincheng nodded and said with a smile, “If you have time, we will definitely bother you.” ”

Ye Zhuo sent song Shiyu out of the unit door.

The song family’s driver was already waiting outside the door.

“Ye Zhuo said, “Brother song, take care on your journey.” ”

“Okay.”Song Shiyu nodded.

...

The next day.

A family of four brought big and small bags of gifts to Lin Shasha’s house.

Zhou Yuelian suddenly saw ye Shu and was extremely surprised. “Ah Shu! When did you come back?”

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “I got home yesterday afternoon. Oh right, Little Lian, let me introduce you. This is my Jin Cheng, and this is my son, Lin Ze. Ah Ze, this is your Aunt Lian.” ”

“Lin Ze politely greeted her, “Aunt Lian.” ”

“Seeing Lin Jin Cheng and Lin Ze, Zhou Yuelian was really happy for ye Shu. Her eyes were slightly red. “After so many years, Ah Shu, you’ve finally come to the bitter end.” ”

“Along the way with Ye Shu, no one understood ye Shu’s sadness better than Zhou Yuelian. ”

Ye Shu hugged Zhou Yuelian. “It’s all in the past.”

“Lin Jincheng couldn’t help but look at Zhou Yuelian with red eyes. “Don’t worry, his aunt. I Won’t let them suffer any more grievances in the future.” ”

Zhou Yuelian nodded.

“Because it was the new year, Lin Sha and Lin Weiwei were both at home. ”

“Lin Sha and Lin Weiwei were twins, while ye Zhuo and Lin Ze were twins. The four of them could play together. ”

“In order to prepare for the college entrance exam, Lin Sha had lost a lot of weight recently. ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Sister Sha Sha, if you work so hard, you will definitely get into the school you like.” ”

“Lin Sha said, “I want to go to your school’s Department of Politics and law.”Lin Sha’s goal in life was to become a lawyer, and the Department of Politics and Law of the capital university was especially famous. ”

“Ye Zhuo continued to ask, “How many points did you get in the mock exam?” ”

“”698,”Lin Sha answered. ”

“Ye Zhuo said, “698, just a little more. Our school’s admission score for the other provinces last year was 710. Sister Sha Sha, you’re not that far off. Keep up the good work. I believe you’ll definitely get into the Capital University.” ”

“Lin sha sighed, “698 is the best result I got! If I don’t do well...” ”

“At this moment, ye Zhuo seemed to have thought of something. He took out a notebook from his bag and handed it to Lin Shasha, “By the way, Sister Shasha, this is the question I wrote according to last year’s college entrance exam. Take a look, maybe this year’s college entrance exam will be successful.” ”

“Really?”Lin Shasha’s eyes lit up.

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded.

“Lin Shasha took the notebook and flipped through two pages. She said excitedly, “This question, this question was also written by the teachers in our tutoring class!”Moreover, the knowledge that ye Zhuo summarized was much more abundant than the teachers in the tutoring class, after looking at the notebook that ye Zhuo gave her, Lin Shasha instantly had an epiphany. ”

...

On the other side.

Ye Sen had an appointment at the coffee shop to discuss a collaboration.

“Just as they were about to leave the coffee shop after discussing the collaboration, Ye Sen suddenly saw a familiar face. was that Gu Dening? ”

Ye Sen was just about to go up and greet her when a young man wearing glasses walked up to him. It seemed that he knew gu dening.

“”Hello, is this miss gu?” ”

“Gu dening nodded. “Yes, it’s me.” ”

“The bespectacled young man continued, “Hello, Miss Gu. I’m Wei Liping. Your aunt introduced us to each other.” ”

“Seeing this, Ye Sen suddenly understood. ”

It turned out that Gu Dening was on a blind date.

“Gu dening was not ugly. Her facial features were exquisite, and she had a good image and temperament. She also had a decent job. Ye Sen thought that she was already taken, but he did not expect gu dening to be single. ”
