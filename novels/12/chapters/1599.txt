She only cared about Zeng Rou’s grievance and forgot about her status as a big family member. She followed the rising tide. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“In the past, if Zeng Rou had suffered any grievance from Zeng Qiuwen’s side, Father Zeng could still say a few words. But now, there was no room for Father Zeng to say anything! ”

“After saying that, Father Zeng turned to look at Zeng Rou and continued, “We are both sisters. You should also reflect on why Zeng Qiuwen was able to marry into the Zhao family, but you can only look at Zeng Qiuwen’s eyes!” ”

Zeng Rou lowered her head and did not say anything.

Wait.

She must take revenge.

“Ye Zhuo had Cen Shaoqing’s support now. She could not touch him, but she could touch Zeng Qiuwen. ”

“During these days in the Zhao family, Zeng Rou had a clear understanding of Zhao Jiadong’s character. ”

“If she could not, she would start with Zhao Jiadong. ”

“She was younger and prettier than Zeng Qiuwen, but she could not. Zhao Jiadong could withstand the temptation. ”

Zeng Rou narrowed her eyes. She would definitely let Zeng Qiuwen have a taste of being chased out of the house!

“Thinking of this, Zeng Rou’s eyes were filled with determination. ”

“Father Zeng continued, “You can’t stay in Yunjing any longer. Pack up. You still have to go to south city! You two are sisters after all. As long as you beg her properly, she will never ignore you!” ”

“No matter what, he could not let outsiders see his joke. He could not let others know that Zeng Rou had been chased out by the Zhao family. ”

Zeng rou nodded obediently.

“He had to go to south city, otherwise how could he take revenge? ”

On the other side.

The Cen family.

“On the second day after Baizhi came, Zhou Xiang came back from his trip. ”

“Although the Cen Old Lady and Zhou Xiang had not seen each other for more than twenty years, Zhou Xiang still went to visit Baizhi every year. After all, the conflict between the Cen Old Lady and Baizhi was between her and baizhi, and they were juniors, they still had to show respect. ”

“Seeing Baizhi in the living room of the Cen family, Zhou Xiang’s face was full of disbelief. He said in surprise, “Aunt! It’s really you!” ”

“”Xiangxiang, come back.”Baizhi smiled and looked up. ”

Zhou Xiang put down his bag and walked over. “I was thinking of coming back to visit you! I didn’t expect you to come here in person!”

“Baizhi said, “I haven’t been to the capital for so many years, so I came to see you. How have you been playing outside these days?” ”

“”Pretty good.”Zhou xiang continued, “I’ll take you and my mom out to play next year!” ”

“That’s a pretty good idea!”Old Mrs. Cen turned to look at Baizhi. “We’ve never been anywhere to play in our lives. Why don’t we go out together?”

“Baizhi nodded. “Sure, I’ll do as you say.” ”

Zhou Xiang’s gaze moved back and forth between the two old men. He was quite surprised.

The two of them had not seen each other for twenty years.

Why did they suddenly...

“Zhou xiang continued, “Aunty, did Wen bin and Wen Yue come back to visit you during the New Year?” ”

“Baizhi shook her head. “Wen Bin said that he was too busy with work and didn’t come back. Wen Yue’s mother-in-law fell down from the building last year and hasn’t woken up yet. She Can’t leave anyone by her side, so she didn’t come back.” ”

“How is it? Is It Serious?”Zhou Xiang asked with concern.

“Baizhi said, “The Doctor said that she might be in a vegetative state.” ”

“It’s that serious?”Zhou Xiang asked in surprise.

“Baizhi nodded. “I’ve discussed it with your uncle-in-law. When we return from the capital city, we’ll go over to see them.” ”

“After chatting with Baizhi for a while, Zhou Xiang came to the restaurant to eat. While eating, he lowered his voice and asked Cen Shaoqing, who was reading beside him, “Shaoqing, when did your grandmother and your aunt-in-law reconcile?” ”

Cen Shaoqing opened his thin lips slightly. “After the third aunt left.”

“Third aunt?”Zhou Xiang frowned. “Which third aunt? Do We have this relative? Why don’t I Know About It?”

“Cen Shaoqing turned a page of the book and said concisely, “A distant relative.” ”

“”OH.”Zhou Xiang was a little curious. “Then, between your grandmother and your aunt, who bowed their heads and admitted their mistakes first?” ”

“According to Old Mrs. Cen’s personality, if she felt that she was not wrong, she would definitely not admit her mistakes first. It was the same for Baizhi. It was precisely because the two of them did not give in to each other that they had been in a stalemate for so many years. ”

Zhou Xiang was really curious about who was the first to admit their mistakes between these two equally strong-willed people.

“Mom.”Cen Shaoqing raised his eyes slightly.

“Okay.”

Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips moved slightly. “You’re too nosy.”

“Zhou Xiang was stunned for a moment before saying, “Who are you calling nosy! I’m just curious! Can’t I just be curious? which one of them admitted their mistakes first?” ”

Cen Shaoqing did not say anything.
