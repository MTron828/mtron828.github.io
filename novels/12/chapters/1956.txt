Translator: 549690339

“Seeing her like this, father he said in surprise, “You still don’t Know?” ”

“I don’t know.”Xu Yao shook her head in confusion. “Am I really pregnant?”

No one could tell that she was acting right now.

“Acting had to be done properly. Of course, she couldn’t let the He family’s parents know that she was pregnant. ”

“Otherwise, she would have fainted for nothing. ”

“Father he nodded. “Yes, you’re pregnant.” ”

Xu Yao’s eyes turned red instantly. She clutched her stomach and laughed as she cried. “I’m pregnant. I’m pregnant with Ziteng’s Child!”

“After saying that, she lifted the blanket on her body. “I’m going to tell Ziteng. Ziteng will definitely be very happy.” ”

“Father he stood behind Xu Yao and held her arm. “Child, calm down now. Ziteng is still in danger. None of us can enter.” ”

He ziteng had to go through today’s critical period before he could leave the ICU.

“But the doctor also said that even if he ziteng passed the critical period, he would only be a cripple in the future. ”

Father he felt like the sky was falling!

“Fortunately, at the most critical moment, the examination revealed that Xu Yao was pregnant. ”

A child represented hope.

Xu Yao’s pregnancy could at least let him see the light and brightness.

“Xu Yao cried, “I have to go and see him. I have to tell him that we have a child. Uncle, please don’t hold me back.” ”

“Father he sighed and tears streamed down his face, “Child, you’re pregnant now. The doctor just said that your fetus is unstable. At this time, your emotions can’t be too volatile. Something has happened to ziteng. You have to protect yourself.” ”

“Xu Yao’s emotions burst at this moment and she sat on the ground, “It’s all because of me. If I didn’t want to drink milk tea, Ziteng wouldn’t have been in trouble! Uncle, hit me! Don’t worry. If anything happens to Ziteng, I definitely won’t live in vain! Whether it’s hell or hell, I’ll be with him!” ”

“Hearing this, father he was shocked. ”

“If anything happened to Xu Yao, then they wouldn’t be able to see any hope! ”

No.

Xu Yao couldn’t be in trouble!

“Father he immediately said, “Child, child, you can’t think like this. You’re not alone right now. You’re still pregnant with Ziteng’s child. No matter what, you have to protect yourself!” ”

“Hearing this, Xu Yao’s lowered eyes were full of sarcasm. ”

Father he was also disgusted.

“When she was dating he ziteng, father he kept calling her miss xu. What about now? ”

“When he found out that she was pregnant, not only did he affectionately call her child, he even asked her to protect him! ”

Mi Chen was still the best.

“If it wasn’t for Mi Chen, she definitely wouldn’t have thought of this move. ”

“Xu Yao buried her pride in the bottom of her heart and cried, “I don’t want to live anymore. I really don’t want to live anymore! Ziteng, ziteng, you mustn’t let anything happen to you!” ”

“At this moment, the sound of footsteps came from outside the door. ”

Xu Yao looked up and saw that it was mother he.

“Other than sadness, there was only disgust on mother he’s face. ”

She didn’t like Xu Yao.

She didn’t like her from the first time they met!

“Later on, it proved that her sixth sense wasn’t wrong. ”

Xu Yao was a disaster.

“If it wasn’t for Xu Yao, he ziteng would definitely not be in trouble. ”

“”Old he, don’t stop her! I want to see if she is really willing to accompany Ziteng!”Mother he’s voice was very cold. ”

How could she be willing to die for a hypocritical woman like Xu Yao!

She was just pretending.

Father he looked at mother he. “Xunfang!”

“Let Her Go!”Mother he said.

Father he had to let Xu Yao go.

Xu Yao narrowed her eyes.

“Ouyang Xunfang, this old woman, was really difficult to deal with. ”Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“It seemed that if she didn’t use some bitter tactics, she really wouldn’t be able to hide it. ”

“Xu Yao raised her head and with a leap, she went over and directly hit the wall. ”

Bang!

A bloody mark was left on the wall on the spot.

“Child!”Father he was shocked.

Mother he was also stunned.

She didn’t expect Xu Yao to really hit the wall.

She had thought that Xu Yao was just putting on an act.

Mother he gulped and took a few steps back.

“Father he immediately walked over and helped Xu Yao up. “Child, child, Are You Alright?” ”

“Xu Yao’s eyes were tightly shut, and the wound on her forehead looked very scary. ”

Father he turned to look at mother he. “Xunfang! Quickly call the Doctor!”

Mother he reacted at this moment and immediately ran outside to call the doctor.

“The doctor arrived very quickly. After he had done the first aid, he turned to look at the two of them, “You family members are too irresponsible. The pregnant woman’s emotions are already unstable, yet you still dare to provoke her! Do you know how dangerous this is? !” ”

“Father he kept apologizing. “Doctor, we know we’re wrong. Um, is the child alright? !” ”

“”You’re her father, right?”? “Since you’re so concerned about her child, you should be more concerned about her!”! “The child’s condition is very bad right now. We need to stay in the hospital to save the Child!”! “Also, the pregnant woman’s mood is very bad right now. She can’t be agitated anymore. When that happens, not to mention the child, we won’t even be able to save the adults!”! “As family members, be careful!” ”

“”Yes, yes, yes, doctor, we understand!”Father he kept wiping the cold sweat off his head. ”

“No one noticed that Xu Yao, who was on the hospital bed, had a faint smile on her face. ”

Idiots.

They were all idiots.

“After the Doctor left, father he looked at mother he. “Xunfang, did you hear what the Doctor said just now?” ”

Mother he did not say anything. She just looked out of the window.

“Father he sighed and continued, “I know you’re feeling bad. Actually, I’m the same as you. I’m also feeling bad. But now that things have already happened, no matter how bad I feel, it’s useless!” ”

“Speaking up to this point, father he paused, then he continued, “No matter whether Xu Yao is acting or not, no matter what her character is, she’s still carrying the child of Ziteng in her stomach. If… … If.. … If anything happens to ziteng, this child will be our last hope! Therefore, xunfang, for Ziteng’s sake, I beg of you, I beg of you, please stop targeting Xu Yao, okay? Let Xu Yao give birth to the child safely!” ”

“At such a time, father he had to support the family. ”

“If he was like mother he and treated Xu Yao as a sinner of the He family, then the family would really be finished! ”

At least there was still a child left.

“After a long while, mother he nodded and compromised, “Alright.” ”

“Under such circumstances, other than agreeing, what else could she say? ”

He ziteng was already in such a state!

“Even if he killed Xu Yao, it wouldn’t be of any help. ”

“Moreover, the current Xu Yao was still the child’s mother. ”

Father he was right. The child in Xu Yao’s stomach was their last hope.

“No matter what, they had to protect this child until he was safely born. ”

“Seeing that mother he finally nodded, father he smiled and said, “Xunfang, it’s good that you can think things through. Xu Yao’s emotions are very unstable right now. I was thinking of contacting her parents and asking them to take care of her.” ”

“With he zi freed up so much time, they simply did not have the energy and extra time to take care of Xu Yao. ”

“Secondly, mother he had a very deep opinion of Xu Yao. If anything were to happen again, the He family would not be able to see any hope. ”

Mother he continued to nod. “It’s up to you.”

She hated Xu Yao. It was best not to see her.

Father he nodded. “Then it’s decided!”

The two of them walked out of Xu Yao’s ward and arrived at the entrance of the ICU.

“Through a glass window, they could clearly see he ziteng lying on the operating table. His body was filled with tubes from the instruments, and he was lifeless. ”

“Seeing this scene, mother he’s mood, which had finally calmed down, became extremely sad again. “Ziteng! My child!” ”

“If it was possible, she was willing to lie on the operating bed in his place. ”

The greatest pain in the world was nothing more than sending someone else to die.

Father he held mother he with both hands and did not say anything. He just looked at he ziteng inside and cried silently.

“At that moment, mother he seemed to have suddenly remembered something. She turned to father he and continued, “Look for Miss Ye! Miss ye will definitely be able to save Ziteng!” ”

“Miss Ye?”Father he frowned slightly.

“Mother he continued, “Miss ye is fifth master’s fiancée. Ziteng once said that Miss Ye’s medical skills are very brilliant. She can heal the bones of dead people. If we contact Miss Ye, she will definitely have a way to save Ziteng!” ”

The husband and wife immediately contacted ye Zao.

But they did not contact ye Zao himself.

Ye Zao was conducting an experiment on Mars.

“Now that the official experiment was at the most critical moment, even Lin Jincheng and ye Shu could not contact her. ”

She could only wait.

“Hearing this, mother he immediately asked, “May I know how long we have to wait?” ”

Ye Zao was he Ziteng’s last hope!

She had to hold on tightly.

“The assistant said, “I’m not too sure about the exact time. It might be half a month, or it might be three days.” ”

“Hearing this, mother he’s face was full of disappointment. ”

“He ziteng had suffered a very serious injury from the crash, and the injury could not be delayed. Even if he ziteng could survive tonight, would he still be able to wait fifteen days? ”

“He ziteng was usually quite popular in the base and did not have much of an official’s airs. When he found out that something had happened to him, the assistant was also very anxious. He continued, “Mrs. He, don’t worry. Once we contact Miss Ye, we will immediately inform you!” ”
