Xu Yao was stunned.

She thought he ziteng had discovered something.

“Hearing this, she heaved a sigh of relief. ”

She knew it. What could a fool like he ziteng discover?

“Xu Yao looked up at Mi Chen and pretended not to know her. She smiled and said, “Hello, Mr. Mi.” ”

“Miss Xu.”Mi Chen also acted very naturally.

“He ziteng looked at Mi Chen and continued, “Doctor Mi, let my girlfriend take a look first.” ”

“Okay.”Mi Chen nodded.

Xu Yao reached out her hand.

The feeling of flirting under he ziteng’s nose was very exciting.

“Although they had been flirting in secret, they didn’t show it on the surface. ”

“After the examination, he ziteng said nervously, “Doctor mi, is my girlfriend okay?” ”

“Mi Chen adjusted her glasses and continued, “Her wound is showing signs of worsening. It is recommended that she be washed with medicine once a day.” ”

“”Is it that serious?”Hearing this, he ziteng became even more nervous. ”

Mi Chen nodded. “Because Miss Xu’s wound is really too deep.”

“He ziteng’s heart ached. He looked at Xu Yao. “It must have hurt a lot back then, right?” ”

“Xu Yao smiled and said, “It didn’t hurt at all.” ”

“Seeing Xu Yao like this, he ziteng felt even more upset. He decided to go back tonight and sit down with his parents to have a good talk. ”

He absolutely could not let Xu Yao suffer this grievance.

“He ziteng continued, “Then I’ll have to trouble doctor Xu to come every day!” ”

“Okay.”Mi Chen nodded.

“After a while, the treacherous minister packed up the medical kit and continued, “Mr. He and Miss Xu, I Won’t disturb the two of you. I’ll come back tomorrow afternoon.” ”

“”Okay.”He ziteng said, “Thank you for your hard work, doctor Mi.” ”

“”This is what I should do,”mi Chen said. ”

“After Mi Chen left, he ziteng grabbed Xu Yao’s hand. “Yaoyao, how can there be such a silly girl like you in the World?” ”

“How dare you call me silly!”Xu Yao frowned and pretended to be unhappy.

“”You are silly to begin with.”If it were any other scheming girl, she would definitely make use of the injury to make a big deal out of it. However, Xu Yao did not say a word and silently endured all of this. She was even worried that after this incident.., would it affect his relationship with his mother. ”

“After saying that, he ziteng continued, “Yaoyao, I have to go home in a while. You Sleep First Tonight.” ”

“”Alright.”Xu Yao nodded. Then, as if she had thought of something, she grabbed he ziteng’s sleeve and continued, “Ziteng, don’t tell me you want to go back and Quarrel with uncle and Auntie?” ”

“He ziteng smiled and said, “Don’t worry, I don’t.” ”

Xu Yao nodded. “Then you go. It’s okay if you don’t come back tonight. Spend more time with uncle and aunt.”

“Okay.”He ziteng kissed Xu Yao and then left the apartment.

He ziteng returned to the He family.

“Father he saw him and said in a low voice, “You Little Brat, you still know to come back! Do you know that you have been so angry with your mother these days? Quickly go and apologize to your mother!” ”

“Ever since he ziteng left, Ouyang Xunfang had been extremely angry. ”

“Even father he had been very careful these past few days, afraid that he might accidentally provoke her. ”

“He ziteng looked at his father, then, he said, “Other than asking me to apologize to her, what else can you do? ! “Ever since I can remember, you have always listened to my mother! “My mother told you to go north, but you didn’t dare to go west. My mother told you to sit down, but you didn’t dare to Stand Up! “Dad, you’re a man. Can’t you live with a little dignity?” ”

“If his father had lived with a little dignity, he wouldn’t have ended up like this. ”

He wouldn’t have dared to force him like this without his mother!

This was all his father’s fault.

Father he was stunned. “What nonsense are you talking about! You Little Brat! Your mother really wants the best for you. How can you say that! Have you ever thought about how sad your mother would be if she heard what you said?”

“”Then did you see me? Have you thought about how sad and sad I am?”He ziteng looked at father he, then he said, “Father, you and my mother are truly in love. I think you should understand my current situation. I really like Yaoyao. Please help us!” ”

Father he was in a difficult position when he heard this.

“He understood he ziteng’s current mood, but according to the analysis of all the signs, Xu Yao was indeed not suitable for he ziteng. ”

“Father he sighed and continued, “Ziteng, you’re really not suitable for Xu Yao. be good and be obedient. Don’t Make Your Mother Unhappy!” ”

Not Suitable?

How was he not suitable for Xu Yao?

“He ziteng looked at father he and continued, “Father, I didn’t come back today to quarrel with you. To tell you the truth, Xu Yao and I have already cohabited! Perhaps she’s already pregnant with our child!” ”

What?

Cohabited!

And pregnant!

“Hearing this, father he’s face turned pale. “What did you say? Pregnant?” ”

“He ziteng continued, “She’s not pregnant yet, but according to the current situation, she’ll get pregnant sooner or later. Dad, you’re a man too. I think you know the meaning of this sentence, right?” ”

“He was a normal man, while Xu Yao was a normal woman. wasn’t it normal for them to be pregnant? ”

“Father he frowned. “Nonsense! Ziteng, you’re too much of a troublemaker! How can you live with someone so casually! Who allowed you to live with her!” ”

Father he never expected things to develop like this.

Mother he was right. Xu Yao was too scheming. She could actually trick he ziteng into living with her!

“If such a girl really married into the He family, the trouble would still be waiting to happen! ”

“The more father he thought about it, the angrier he got. ”

“He ziteng said, “Dad, I’m already an adult. I know what I’m doing. Do I have to report to your mother who I’m living with?” ”

“Father he frowned. “I don’t care about that. You can explain it to your mother yourself. As long as you get past your mother, I don’t Care!” ”

“Where’s My Mother?”He ziteng asked.

“”In the study,”father he replied. ”

He ziteng came to the study and knocked on the door.

“Soon, his mother’s voice came from the study. “Come in.” ”

He ziteng pushed the door open and entered.

Mother he was practicing calligraphy to calm her heart.

He ziteng took the initiative to speak. “Mother.”

“Compared to a few days ago, mother he was much calmer. She looked at he ziteng from the corner of her eyes. “You still know to come back?” ”

“”I came back to tell you that I have to be with Yaoyao.”He ziteng paused and continued, “Also, Yaoyao’s hand was injured because of you. So, I hope you can apologize to her!” ”

“He ziteng continued, “Mother, I can assure you that Yaoyao is a very good girl. In the future, she will be an excellent daughter-in-law. I hope you can accept her!” ”

“What if I don’t accept her?”Mother he asked back.

“He ziteng said, “I’m just informing you.” ”

“Mother he’s anger came from her heart, but she still held it in. She looked at he ziteng and said coldly, “He ziteng, let me tell you now. I Don’t care how you play outside or How Crazy You Are! But if you want to marry that kind of woman into your family, it’s impossible!” ”

Play was play.

The position of the He family’s mistress was definitely not something Xu Yao could sit on.

“Hearing this, he ziteng was very angry. “Mom, do you have to make this trip? I don’t understand why you keep targeting yaoyao!” ”

Mother he did not speak anymore. She put down the brush and massaged her temples.

“Seeing this, father he immediately ran over. “Xunfang, are you alright? is your head hurting again?” ”

“After saying that, he turned to look at he ziteng. “Ziteng! Quickly apologize to your mother!” ”

“He ziteng said stubbornly, “I’m not in the wrong.” ”

“If he was right, why should he apologize? ”

He was just defending his love.

“Clearly, his mother was making trouble without reason! ”

“Mother he pinched her temples and continued, “Forget it, forget it.” ” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“”I’ll go get you a glass of water,”father he said. ”

Mother he nodded.

Mother he looked at He ziteng. “You really want to be with her?”

“It’s more real than real gold!”He ziteng nodded firmly.

“”Okay, I agree to this,”mother he said. ”

“Hearing this, he ziteng said in surprise, “Really? Mom, you agree!”He did not expect his mother to suddenly let go! The surprise came too quickly! ”

“His mother continued, “But I have a condition.” ”

“”Please say it,”he ziteng said. ”

“As long as he could be with Xu Yao, he would agree to any condition. ”

“”Three years.”His mother’s tone was a little slow. “First, date Xu Yao for three years. If after three years, you still love her as firmly as you do now, I will fulfill your wish!” ”

“The itch of three years, the pain of seven years. ”

“Many couples could not last three years, let alone Xu Yao who was acting for he ziteng. ”

She did not believe that Xu Yao could act for three years!

He ziteng was stunned again!

Three years?

“He wanted to marry Xu Yao immediately, but his mother made him wait for three years! ”

He ziteng could not accept this.

“”Didn’t you say that you two are in true love?”Mother he looked up at he ziteng and continued, “Since it’s true love, you can’t even wait for three years?” ”
