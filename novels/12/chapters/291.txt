Cured?

The cancer had actually been cured?

How was this possible!

The moment he said this.

The entire room was silent.

“Su Zishan’s expression was extremely ugly, alternating between green and white. ”

“After a long while, she finally reacted and looked at her assistant. “Little He, stop joking!” ”

How could the cancer be cured!

This was impossible.

“Therefore, her assistant, little he, was definitely joking. ”

“When he said this, everyone else in the office also reacted. They smiled and said, “That’s right, little he! It’s not good to joke about this kind of thing! If the patient’s family heard what you said, wouldn’t it be a false joy!” ”

Little he looked serious. “Why would I joke about this kind of thing with you guys! Hurry up and get ready. The meeting will start in ten minutes! I’m going to inform the other departments!”

“After saying that, Xiao he turned around and jogged away. ”

It looked like he was really in a hurry.

The office returned to silence.

“”Dr. Su, Dr. Su, this seems to be true! Xiao He isn’t joking with us!”Dr. Li, who was sitting beside Su Zishan, turned around and looked at Su Zishan. ”

Su Zishan was stunned. Her eyes were filled with disbelief.

“How, how could this be? ”

“That little girl, how could she possibly cure cancer? ”

On what basis?

Su Zishan could not describe what she felt in her heart. It was very uncomfortable.

The office was also filled with sighs.

“Initially, everyone was waiting to see ye Zao and Gu Dening become a joke. ”

“Previously, they had said that they were going to hold a farewell party for Gu Dening. ”

Who would have thought that a slap to the face would come so quickly.

He had recovered just like that!

“”Sigh! It’s really different from the same person! If I had known that Miss Ye was really capable, I would have joined Group A back then!” ”

“”Little Gu’s fate is still better, leaping through the dragon’s Gate!” ”

“”In the future, we and Little Gu won’t be in the same world anymore. Who knows, we might even have to report to Little Gu once we see him!” ”

“That’s right! Sigh! It’s really different from the same person’s fate! Why do you think Little Gu’s taste is so good?”

“”Back then, when Xiao Gu applied to be the team leader of Group A, we were laughing at her! Now it’s her turn to laugh at us! It’s really like the saying goes, ‘The river flows east for thirty years, but the river flows west for thirty years’.” ”

“Everyone spoke one after another, and their words were filled with envy for Gu deling. ” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Apart from envy, there was also regret. They regretted that they did not volunteer to be the team leader of group a like Gu deling back then. ”

The person who felt the most pain was Su Zishan.

“After all, in the beginning, Su Zishan was team a leader. ”

She was the one who pushed away the honor.

Su Zishan was stunned until she reached the meeting room.

“She looked at Gu Deling, who was standing on the stage and smiling. She felt like she could not breathe. ”

Two hours later.

The meeting ended.

The first People’s Hospital of Yunjing held a press conference.

It announced a piece of news that shocked the whole country and even the whole world.

As soon as the news came out.

The whole world was boiling!

The hot searches on all the major websites around the world were all about curing cancer.

“A microphone was placed in front of Su Zishan. “Hello, Doctor.” ”

“Susan didn’t expect to be on camera, so she immediately put on a decent smile. “Hello.” ”
