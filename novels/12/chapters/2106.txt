Cen Shaoqing pursed his lips and didn’t say anything.

“Ye Zhuo held Cen Shaoqing’s arm. “It’s useless for you to think too much now. I’ve already asked ye Han to make the arrangements. Once everything is arranged, we’ll go to the main alliance. At that time, we’ll be able to see the truth.” ”

“En.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“”Right, you haven’t eaten yet, right? Let’s go out for a meal?”Ye Zhuo looked at Cen Shaoqing. ”

“Okay.”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “We won’t go to the cafeteria today. Let’s go to the Snack Street near South University. I want to eat the stinky tofu there.” ”

“Okay.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Then I’ll go and change my clothes first.”

“”Where are the clothes?”Cen Shaoqing turned his eyes and said, “I’ll go and get them for you.” ”

“They’re in my office. Just take any one of them.”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing went out to get his clothes.

“Soon, Cen Shaoqing came back with his clothes. Ye Zhuo took the clothes and went inside to change. Then, he went out to eat with Cen Shaoqing. ”

“Although it was hot outside, they were wearing clothes that could adjust the temperature. Not only did they not feel hot at all, but they were also very cool and comfortable. ”

“Today was Sunday, so there were a lot of students in the Snack Street. It was very lively with groups of two or three. ”

“Seeing such a lively scene with a beautiful woman by his side, even the sadness on Cen Shaoqing’s face disappeared a little. ”

“Because it was Sunday, the stinky tofu stall that ye Zao liked also had a long line. ”

“Just as the two of them were queuing up, Ye Zao’s phone rang. ”

“Ye Zao raised his head and looked at Cen Shaoqing. “I’m going to take a call. Help me line up. I want one original flavor, one perverted spicy, and also a spicy rice noodle.” ”

“If it were in the past, Cen Shaoqing would definitely question whether ye Zhuo could finish all the food he wanted. But now, he was completely used to it. ”

This person was really skinny and had a big appetite.

“I know.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Then I’ll go first.”

“Go.”

“Ye Zhuo went to the bathroom, closed the cubicle door, and answered the phone. ”

“Her phone had been modified, and it was different from ordinary phones. It had 3D shadow technology. As soon as she opened the phone, she saw Ye Han sitting at the other end of the office. ”

“At present, the 3d Shadow technology was very mature. If it were not for the fact that they were separated by a galaxy, she would have thought that ye Han was standing right in front of her. ”

“Seeing ye Zhuo, ye Han asked in a rather unwelcoming manner, “Sister, are you going to the General Alliance?” ”

“”Yes.”Ye zhuo nodded and continued, “Your brother-in-law’s father has already been found.” ”

“Is he the one from the main alliance country?”Ye Han asked tentatively.

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo said.

“Hearing this, Ye Han’s face was full of surprise. He did not expect that Cen Shaoqing’s background was actually so big. ”

“”If that’s the case, isn’t my brother-in-law the young master of Dongli?”Ye Han asked. ”

“You can put it that way.”

“Ye Han suddenly understood and said, “No wonder they’ve been looking for Dongli, but they couldn’t find it no matter how hard they tried. So my brother-in-law is the young master of Dongli. Oh right, sister, what does brother-in-law plan to do now? Come to the allied country to meet father and Son?” ”

“Ye Zhuo was as calm as ever. “First go to the allied country to investigate the matter clearly. As for the other problems, we’ll talk about it later.” ”

“”Alright, I got it.”Ye Han continued, “I’ll do it right away. Once it’s done, I’ll send you a text message.” ”

“”EN, thank you for your hard work.”As if recalling something, ye Zhuo continued, “Don’t let anyone know about this matter. Don’t let anyone know.” ”

“”I know about this.”Ye Han added, “Sis, when you guys come over, be careful.”. The situation in the main alliance might be more troublesome than you think. “But I will investigate everything in advance. When you come, come to Changyue first.” ”

“I know.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Because time was limited, ye Zhuo didn’t chat with Ye Han much. After hanging up the phone, he returned to the Snack Street. ”

“Cen Shaoqing had already bought stinky tofu and was sitting at an empty table, using boiling water to heat his chopsticks. ”

“He had always had a serious mysophobia. Before he met ye Zao, he wouldn’t even look at roadside stalls like this. After he met ye Zao, because ye Zao liked it, he also came over to eat, but every time before he ate, he habitually used boiling water to heat his cutlery or used his own cutlery. ”

“So Fast?”Ye Zao walked over and sat down.

“”Yes.”Cen Shaoqing placed the tableware in front of ye Zhuo and continued, “I also ordered some skewers and chicken ribs. They will be sent over in a moment.” ”
