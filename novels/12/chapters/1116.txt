Ye Zhuo followed the waiter’s footsteps.

They walked into the hall together.

“Little white asked curiously, “Where are we going?” ”

“Hearing this, the waiter turned around slightly and was about to explain when the ‘person’who spoke was actually little white. His face was full of surprise. “It... It can talk?” ”

“When she first entered the door, she saw Whitey following behind ye Zao and thought that Whitey was just a very ordinary robot. She did not expect it to actually be able to talk. ”

“Whitey politely waved at the waiter, “Hello, Little Sister! Not only can it talk, it also knows how to clean, wash dishes, and wash dishes. Only you would not have thought that it is the smartest and cutest robot in the universe, ye Whitey!” ”

The waiter was stunned.

“This robot was a little different from what she had imagined. Not only could it speak, but it also had its own thoughts. This was too intelligent! ”

“After a moment, the waiter came to his senses and said with a smile, “Hello, Hello!” ”

“You haven’t answered me. Where are we going now!”Xiao Baibai continued to say.

“The waiter said, “Elder Zhang has prepared a dress for Miss Ye to wear at the banquet. We are going to the changing room now.” ”

“OH.”

“”Meow,”brother Meow answered. ”

The waiter then noticed that there was a cat in Whitey’s pocket.

Oh My God!

This is so cute!

“After a while, they arrived at the changing room. ”

“A young woman wearing a uniform stood outside the changing room. The waiter came forward and said, “Sister Amy, this is Miss Ye.” ”

“Amy immediately walked forward. “Hello, Miss Ye! I’m Amy, your costume designer for tonight. This way, please.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and turned his head to look at Whitey. “Wait outside. Don’t cause any trouble.”

“Okay.”

The waiter looked up at Ye Zhuo and mustered up his courage. “Miss... Miss Ye.”

“What’s Wrong?”Ye Zhuo looked back slightly.

“The waiter continued, “Can... can I take a photo with it?” ”

“Sure.”

“”Thank you, Miss Ye!”The waiter was very excited. ”

“You’re welcome.”Ye Zao’s eyebrows remained the same. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“After getting ye Zao’s approval, the attendant immediately took out his phone from his pocket, adjusted it to selfie mode, and started taking photos. ”

“Xiao Bai said, “Miss Ye, remember to give me a pretty face!” ”

“Meow.”Brother Meow expressed his agreement.

The attendant looked at Xiao Bai in surprise. “You even know about pretty faces?”

“”Of course!”Whitey placed its hands on its waist and said proudly, “Not only do I know about beauty, I know a lot! I’m the most powerful robot in the world!” ”

“Oh my God! It’s so cute!”The waiter’s heart was about to melt from cuteness. He adjusted the camera mode to the video mode.

“Whitey continued to ask, “Little sister, do you think I’m cute or this silly cat is cute?” ”

“Meow!”Brother Meow stuck his head out of his pocket and stared at the waiter with his Big Kazilan Eyes.

“You two are so cute!”

“Perfunctory!”Whitey grunted. “I’m obviously cuter than this silly cat!”

“Meow!”Brother Meow stretched out his paw and slapped Whitey in the face.

The waiter was amused by this scene.

...

In the changing room.

“Since she hadn’t seen ye Zao before, Amy didn’t know what style ye Zao would be suitable for, so she chose three different gowns. ”

The first one was white.

White was the least picky color.

Those with yellowish skin could brighten up their skin by wearing white. Those with fair skin could make their skin as white as snow by wearing white.

“In addition, White also had the meaning of not being stained by mud. Therefore, many people would choose white evening dresses at the banquet. ”

The second set was a pink princess dress.

“Compared to white, pink was a little picky about skin color. ”

“Those with slightly darker skin color would not stay in pink. Fortunately, the design of this evening dress was more playful. When it was really worn, it was not as ugly as imagined. ”

The third set was black.

“It was a simple strapless design. The black skirt was inlaid with tiny diamonds. When one looked at it, it was sparkling like a dazzling starry sky. ”

It was mysterious and elegant.

“Compared to white and pink, Black was the most picky color. ”

“Black was not only picky about the skin, but also about the facial features and temperament, especially this starry sky design. ”

“Skin color, facial features, temperament, as long as one of these three could not keep up, it would be suppressed by the rich black, overwhelming the host. ”

“”Miss Ye, look at these three gowns, which one would you like to try?” ”
