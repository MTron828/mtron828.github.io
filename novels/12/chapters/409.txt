Translator: 549690339

He had done something worse than a beast!

He deserved to die!

“At this moment, Mu Yourong also woke up. When she saw Li Qiandong beside her, there was not much emotion on her face. ”

“Li Qiandong gave himself a vicious slap. “Yourong, I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I don’t know what’s going on with me either!” ”

“Mu Yourong lifted the blanket and got out of bed. She said very calmly, “Big Brother Li, let’s just pretend that nothing happened! Don’t worry, I Won’t let you take responsibility. It’s just that we should never see each other again.” ”

“Yourong!”Li Qiandong’s heart ached terribly.

“Mu yourong said, “Big Brother Li, this isn’t my first time. You Don’t have to bear too much of a psychological burden.” ”

It wasn’t his first time?

It wasn’t his first time. What was that Blood Stain on the bedsheet?

“Mu Yourong was truly too kind. Even at this moment, she was still trying to justify him. ”

“In this instant, Li Qiandong felt even more guilty! ”

“”Yourong! Don’t worry, I will be responsible for you! I will definitely be responsible for you! Marry me. Although I know that I’m not worthy of you, don’t worry, I will definitely treat you well!” ”

“After saying this, Li Qiandong knelt on the ground. ”

Mu Yourong’s back was facing him.

“At this moment, Li Qiandong could not see the corners of Mu Yourong’s mouth curling up into a proud smile. ”

A Fool was a fool!

He was destined to be her stepping stone in this life.

“”Yourong, Please! Give me a chance to atone for my sins!”Li Qiandong knelt over and hugged mu yourong’s leg. ”

“Mu Yourong closed her eyes and two streams of tears flowed out. She choked and said, “Big Brother Li, get up first.” ”

“”No! Yourong, I won’t get up unless you promise me!” ”

Mu Yourong took a deep breath. “Alright... I Promise You.”

“Really?”Li Qiandong was overjoyed.

Mu Yourong nodded.

“”That’s great! Yourong, thank you!”Li Qiandong got up from the ground and hugged mu yourong. ”

“After obtaining Mu Yourong’s understanding, Li Qiandong called father Li and told him that he was going to marry Mu Yourong. ”

“When father Li heard about this, he was so angry that he almost vomited blood. “Unfilial son! Unfilial Son! If you dare to marry that woman, don’t acknowledge me as your father in the future! I don’t have a son like you!” ”

“Li Qiandong’s gaze was firm as he said, “Father, no matter what you say, I will marry yourong! Your misunderstanding of her is too deep! She really is a very good girl!” ”

Father Li immediately hung up on Li Qiandong.

“Mu Yourong witnessed Li Qiandong making the call. “Big Brother Li, why don’t you forget it? You Can’t abandon your uncle for me.” ”

“Li Qiandong held mu yourong’s arm. “Yourong, don’t worry. My father is a very reasonable person. I believe that as long as he meets you, he will definitely fall in love with you.” ”

No one would dislike a kind and good girl like Mu Yourong.

“Really?”Mu Yourong was a little embarrassed.

“Really!”

...

On the other side.

Ye Zhuo was playing chess with Cen Shaoqing in the Cen family’s chess room.

“The two of them chased after each other step by step, neither giving way to the other. ”

Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly. “I’ve never met anyone who could make me feel threatened. You’re the second.”Ye Zhuo could play chess with others without thinking.

“However, he could not play chess with CEN Shaoqing and that unlucky guy on the internet. ”

Both of them were experts among experts.

“They needed to maintain their intelligence online at all times, or else they would break the ice and create an irreversible situation. ”

Cen Shaoqing’s left hand that was holding the Buddha bead paused. “Then who’s the first person?”

Ye Zao’s fingertip slowly placed a stone on the chessboard. “Someone you don’t know.”

That familiar feeling came again.

Uncomfortable.

He seemed to be holding in a ball of anger.

“Ye Zao continued, “I feel that the two of you should be equally skilled in go.” ”

“OH.”Cen Shaoqing’s tone was indifferent.

“At this moment, Cen Shaoqing’s phone suddenly rang. Cen Shaoqing picked up the phone and when he heard the voice on the other end, he subconsciously frowned. ”

“A moment later, he hung up the phone. His expression was still rather unsightly. ”

“What’s Wrong?”Ye Zhuo asked curiously.

“CEN shaoqing slowly said, “Li Qiandong wants to marry mu yourong.” ”

Ye Zhuo chuckled. “Looks like that brother of yours has been fooled by Mu Yourong quite a bit. He can’t wait to become a pan xia.”

“People are stupid. There’s nothing we can do about it.”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “I feel that there’s something fishy about Shen Rong’s death. Perhaps... it has something to do with Mu Yourong.” ”

“What do you mean?”Cen Shaoqing picked up a chess piece.
