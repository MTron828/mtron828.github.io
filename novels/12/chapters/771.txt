Translator: 549690339

The sudden sound in the quiet room made song Chenyu Tremble in fear.

“Before she could react, the crystal hair clip on her hair had been violently ripped off.”

An intense pain came from her scalp.

“Song Chenyu raised her head to look at song Shiyu, her eyes filled with disbelief. “Third brother...””

Song Shiyu had never treated her this way since she was young.

What was going on today?

“If it wasn’t for the fact that her hair had been torn off, she would have thought that she was dreaming.”

How did song Shiyu suddenly become like this? Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Was his mania acting up?

“In the past, even if song Shiyu’s mania was acting up, he wouldn’t treat her like this!”

Could it be that song Shiyu’s condition had worsened and he didn’t recognize her?

“Song Chenyu’s eyes reddened immediately. “Third brother, I’m Chenyu...””

“As long as song Shiyu knew that she was song Chenyu, he would definitely apologize to her immediately.”

Song Shiyu clenched his hair clip tightly in his hands.

The veins on his forehead bulged. It was obvious that he was extremely furious.

Even song Chenyu had never seen song Shiyu like this.

“Get lost!”

Get lost?

Song Shiyu actually told her to get lost?

Song Chenyu’s eyes were filled with disbelief.

He was song Shiyu’s most beloved younger sister. Why would song Shiyu tell her to get lost?

“Third brother! Take a good look at who I am!”Song Chenyu couldn’t help but roar. “Isn’t it just a hairpin?”

Did song Shiyu have to be so angry at her over a hairpin?

“Moreover, song Shiyu had bought this hairpin for him!”

Song Chenyu was not sure which of song Shiyu’s words had angered song Shiyu.

Slap!

A crisp sound of a slap suddenly appeared in the air.

“Song Chenyu’s head was hit hard to the side, and a bright red palm print appeared on the left side of his face.”

“Get lost!”

“This time, song Chenyu was completely dumbfounded.”

She did not expect song Shiyu to hit her.

“Ever since she was young, song Shiyu had never said a single harsh word to her.”

“Even at Old Madam Song’s funeral, Song Shiyu did not blame her for not returning to Yun Jing because her schedule was too full.”

But now...

Song Shiyu actually hit her because of a small hairpin.

Could it be that song Shiyu did not buy this hairpin for her?

But she was song Shiyu’s only sister.

“If he didn’t buy it for her, who else could he buy it for?”

“Song Chenyu looked at the unfamiliar song Shiyu in front of him, and his entire body turned cold.”

He had to admit that this song Shiyu was really too terrifying.

He was like a demon that had crawled out of Hell.

That gaze...

Was as if he wanted to kill someone.

“Song Chenyu stood rooted to the ground, almost forgetting to react.”

“Special Assistant Liu saw that something was wrong, and immediately walked in front of Song Chenyu, holding song Chenyu’s hand as they walked downstairs.”

Bang!

“As soon as they left, there was a violent sound of the door closing behind them.”

The sudden loud sound made song Chenyu’s heart tremble.

At that moment.

She almost thought that she would die under song Shiyu’s hands.

Song Shiyu was a person.

“He was temperamental, unpredictable, and his hands were stained with blood.”

He could even kill his biological father.

He came downstairs.

Special Assistant Liu went to look for the first aid kit.

“Song Chenyu sat on the sofa, covering her left cheek with her hand. Her eyes were dark.”

She really could not understand why song Shiyu would treat her like this.

“”Miss Chenyu, please apply some medicine first.”Special Assistant Liu handed song Chenyu a box of ointment.”

Song Chenyu looked up at Special Assistant Liu. “What’s with the hair clip?”

“Special Assistant Liu shook his head. “I only know that the boss cherishes this hair clip very much. Previously, he even auctioned an antique crystal jewelry box to hold this crystal hair clip.””

“A crystal hair clip was only a few dollars, but the crystal box song Shiyu auctioned at the auction cost seven figures.”

Song Chenyu narrowed his eyes.

Could it be...

That song Shiyu had someone in his heart?

It shouldn’t be.

“Song Shiyu had very serious personality disorders, emotional disorders, zero degrees of empathy, and even professional psychologists said that he might die alone.”

“How could a selfish, cold-blooded, and heartless person like someone?”

“Song Shiyu turned to look at special assistant Liu and asked, “Has my third brother been particularly interested in anyone recently?””

“No.”Special Assistant Liu shook his head.

Song Chenyu narrowed his eyes.

No?

Then whose hair clip was this?

Could it be song Shiyu’s mother’s relic?

“Song Shiyu’s mother had died tragically, and she had encountered many misfortunes in her childhood. That was why she had become a moody person with emotional difficulties.”

“If that hair clip was song Shiyu’s mother’s relic, then all of this could be easily explained.”

With that thought in mind.

“Song Chenyu felt much better and continued, “Third brother, how long are you planning to stay in the capital this time?””
