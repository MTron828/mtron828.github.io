“”I brought them to Mars, so I’m responsible for bringing them back safely,”ye Zao said. ”

“”Miss Ye,”director Zhou hesitated for a moment before speaking. It had already been five days and five nights, and Mars was short of resources. Perhaps team leader Yu and the others had already... ... .” ”

The last sentence is self-evident.

“The words fall, zhou continued, “Miss Ye, each of us is heartbroken that something like this happened to team leader Yu and assistant Li, but it has already happened. We, as people, must learn to accept reality. So far, I’ve notified their parents, and I’ve done my best to appease them. Miss Yip, instead of wasting manpower and resources like this, why not... ... .. ”

“At this moment, there was a knock on the door. ”

Tang Mi ran over to open the door.

“After opening the door, Tang mi said in surprise, “Auntie, why are you here?” ”

“It was none other than Yu Zifei’s mother, Tian Zhifang. ”

Tian Zhifang’s eyes were already red and swollen. “I’m here to see Miss Ye.”

“Please come in.”Tang mi politely invited her in.

Tian Zhifang nodded and went inside.

“Miss Ye.”

“Hearing Tian Zhifang’s voice, Ye Zhuo put down the mouse in his hand and looked back. “Auntie Tian, don’t worry. No matter what, I’ll give you and uncle Yu an explanation.” ”

“”No, no, no.”Tian Zhifang shook her head. “Miss Ye, you’ve misunderstood. I’m here to tell you that old Yu and I are going to give up on finding Zi Fei!” ”

“What did you say?”

“Tian Zhifang repeated, “Yes, Miss Ye. You didn’t Mishear. We’ve decided to give up on looking for Zifei. It’s been five days, and there’s still no news. He might, might have already...” ”

Tian Zhifang couldn’t say the rest.

“Then.., tian Zhifang continued, “Being able to go to Mars is the happiest thing in Zifei’s life. We respect the child’s opinion. Don’t worry. I’ll blame anyone for Zifei’s death. “Perhaps the child’s fate with our mother and son, father and son, has already ended.” ”

“Ye Zhuo stood there and looked at Tian Zhifang. “Auntie, don’t worry. No matter what, I will not give up on the search and rescue. I want to see her alive, and I want to see her dead.” ”

“Tian Zhifang held back her tears. “Miss Ye, I know you’ve done your best. Forget it!” ”

Beep! Beep!

“At this moment, an alarm suddenly sounded in the air. ”

Ye Zhuo immediately trotted over and saw red dots flashing on the huge screen.

Ye Zhuo narrowed his eyes and quickly analyzed the current location.

“Tian Zhifang continued, “Miss Ye, I heard that you haven’t slept for five days and five nights. Please rest well. I’m going back.” ”

“”Tang Mi, send Auntie Tian off for me.” ”

“Okay.”Tang mi immediately walked over to send Tian Zhifang off.

“After ye Zhuo locked onto his position, he took Cen he, Cen Hu, and Tang Mi on an aircraft and set off. ”

“After boarding the aircraft, Tang mi asked excitedly, “Did you find team leader Yu and assistant Xiao Li?” ”

“I think so.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Hearing this, the sadness on Tang Mi’s face disappeared in an instant, and she continued, “Really, Miss Ye! Then I’ll immediately tell uncle and Auntie about this good news!” ”

“”Keep it a secret for the time being,”ye Zhuo said. ”

“Why?”Tang Mi was stunned.

“”Little stutterer, are you stupid!”Cen Hu knocked on Tang Mi’s head, “If you don’t find out that it’s old Yu when you arrive at the place, won’t your efforts be in vain soon? How can uncle and Auntie bear this great sorrow and Joy?” ”

“”I see.”Tang mi nodded and continued, “Team leader Yu and assistant Xiao Li are very lucky. They’ll definitely be fine.” ”

“Okay.”

The assistant felt that she was going to die soon.

“She looked at the horizon, her pupils gradually dilating. “Team, team leader Yu...” ”

“Okay.”

“I already said that miss ye must have given up on us. You still don’t believe me...”the assistant’s voice sounded ethereal and helpless. “How is it now? I’m going to die...”

“She’ll come.”Miss Ye would definitely come.

“”You, are you miss ye’s brain-dead Fan?”The little assistant asked speechlessly. ”

“At this time, Yu Zifei actually still believed that ye Zhuo would come. ”

“”Team leader Yu, I might have to leave first.” ”

“Don’t talk nonsense. Save your energy. Trust Miss Ye.”

The little assistant curled up a pale smile.

Mars base.

“The sudden disappearance of ye Zao made the parents of the little assistant, Li Xiang, very unhappy. ”

“Their daughter’s life and death were still unknown, but ye Zao had disappeared! ”
