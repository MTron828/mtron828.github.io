Kowtow?

“Zheng Wanyin narrowed her eyes. “Grandma, isn’t this a little inappropriate?” ”

“”What’s so inappropriate about it?”Xie wanqiu continued, “Since she wants to apologize and admit her mistake to me, she must show her sincerity!” ”

“If he did not make ye Zao kneel, Ye Zao would never know who his elder was. ”

“Zheng wanyin continued, “Since cousin-in-law has already come over to apologize to you, it means that she has an elder like you in her heart. Why Don’t we just forget about this matter!” ”

Forget about it?

“”It’s impossible to just forget about it!”Xie wanqiu raised her head to look at Zheng Wanyin, “Yinyin, do you know why ye Zao caught you and bullied you? Because you’re easy to bully! Today, I must let ye Zao know that the older the wiser!” ”

“Quickly go and stand guard outside!”

Zheng Wanyin’s face was full of embarrassment.

“Xie wanqiu frowned and said, “Yinyin! Didn’t you hear me when I was talking to you?” ”

“Zheng Wanyin sighed. “I just feel that it’s not good. If cousin finds out, do you think he’ll be angry?” ”

“”Angry? What’s there to be angry about!”Xie wanqiu said, “I’m his grandmother!” ”

Cen Shaoqing had no reason to be angry with her.

“In other words, would his eldest grandson be angry with his grandmother? ”

“Besides, Cen Shaoqing was so filial. ”

Would Cen Shaoqing be angry with his grandmother because of a little girl?

“If Cen Shaoqing was really angry, he would not have asked ye Zhuo to come and apologize to her. ”

Ye Zhuo coming to apologize to her meant that Cen Shaoqing respected her as a grandmother.

He treated her as a grandmother more important than the heavens!

Zheng Wanyin still did not want to go.

“Xie wanqiu continued, “Hurry up and Go! What are you still standing there for! Do you want me to be angry?”Zheng Wanyin was so kind-hearted that Xie Wanqiu was worried that after she died, what would happen if those people bullied Zheng Wanyin? ”

Zhou Xiang was not Zheng Wanyin’s biological second aunt. It was impossible to count on Zhou Xiang.

Therefore.

They had to find a good husband for Zheng Wanyin.

This good husband naturally had to be from the CEN family.

The Cen family was the number one family in China.

“Zheng Wanyin was also so outstanding. Other than the CEN family, no one was worthy of Zheng Wanyin! ”

“Once the old woman from the Cen family died, the Cen family would belong to her. ”

“Zheng wanyin continued, “Then what if cousin-in-law gets angry?” ”

“Then get her out of Here! Get as far away from here as possible!”Xie wanqiu said.

“As long as ye Zao dared to get out of here, she would immediately get Cen Shaoqing to dump ye Zao. ”

“At that time, Zheng Wanyin would be able to officially take over. ”

Bang Bang Bang —

“At this moment, there was a knock on the door. ”

It must be ye Zao.

“”Yinyin, go quickly.”Xie wanqiu pushed Zheng Wanyin. “Do as I say!” ”

Zheng Wanyin walked forward with some difficulty.

“Seeing Zheng Wanyin like this, Xie wanqiu immediately got up from the bed. “I’ll do it myself!”Zheng Wanyin was too kind-hearted. She definitely couldn’t bear to let ye Zao Kowtow. ”

Xie wanqiu walked in front of Zheng Wanyin.

Kowtow.

Would Ye Zhuo Kowtow?

“In order to marry Cen Shaoqing, ye Zhuo could even endure humiliation and apologize. ”

“Although kowtowing hurt her dignity, ye Zhuo should kowtow, right? ”

“Thinking of the image of Ye Zhuo kowtowing to her, Zheng Wanyin could not tell what emotions she had in her heart. ”

Ye Zhuo deserved this.

“If ye Zhuo had not deliberately given her a low score, it would not have been ye Zhuo’s turn to kowtow to her. ”

“If it were not for ye Zao, she would have successfully gotten 3A and been promoted to the ABA management team. ”

“However, not only had she been removed from the ABA Team, she had also been blacklisted. Not only her, even her future children would not be able to join the ABA Team. ”

Not to mention kowtowing.

“Even if ye Zao sacrificed his life, it would not be an exaggeration. ”

Zheng Wanyin reached out to grab the door handle and pulled it open.

Xie wanqiu stood in front of the door and blocked it. “You want me to forgive you? Show me some sincerity and kowtow three times!”

Kowtow?

Three times?

“The nurses who were doing their routine checks were stunned. They took a step back and looked at the ward number. After confirming that there was nothing wrong with the ward number, they asked, “Are... Are You Alright?” ”

Didn’t they say that there was nothing wrong with the patient in this ward? Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Why did she feel like her brain was not working properly?

Who would say something like kowtowing three times?

Only then did Xie wanqiu look up. What she saw was not ye Zhuo’s figure.

It was a nurse dressed in white.

Xie Wanqiu’s expression changed and she felt a little awkward.

“Zheng Wanyin also reacted at this moment. She smiled and said, “Miss Nurse, I’m sorry. My grandmother was not talking to you just now.” ”

“The nurse smiled and said, “It’s alright. Let’s go in and take your blood pressure.” ”
