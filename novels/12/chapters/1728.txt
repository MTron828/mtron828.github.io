“”Gu si, you’re wrong! Betrayal and whether Europa is a small earth are two different things. Betrayal is a moral issue!” ”

“”But from Professor Feng and director Ma’s Point of view, it’s not strange that they would rebel!”Gu si continued, “They’ve been studying Europa all their lives. Suddenly, someone told them that Europa is a worthless planet. I’m afraid that no one would be able to accept it!” ”

“Ye Zhuo didn’t know Europa at all. If she really knew Europa, she wouldn’t have said those words. ”

Professor Feng and director Ma looked at a person who didn’t know Europa at all. It was normal for them to have a rebellious heart when they slandered Europa.

Professor Feng and director Ma had been studying Europa all year round. They had already treated Europa as their own child. How could they not be angry when they saw their own child being slandered? Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Gu si continued, “In other words, professor Feng and director Ma did not betray the base at all. They were just proving themselves! “They wanted to use their actions to tell Miss ye that their insistence was not wrong. Europa is not a planet full of danger! “I think miss ye owes Professor Feng and director Ma an apology.” ”

“”Miss Ye does not owe anyone an apology!”Cen Jiang stood up from the conference table. “Currently, the spaceship from Country C has not returned to Earth. No one knows whether Europa is a gentle planet or not!” ”

“Gu Si looked at Cen Jiang, then, she said, “Team leader Cen, I know that you respect miss ye very much. We are the same as you. I also respect Miss Ye! If it weren’t for Miss Ye, we wouldn’t have been able to build a lightspeed aircraft carrier. But it’s a mistake! This can not be denied! Whether the other party is someone else or Miss Ye! I hope you can see this reality clearly.” ”

“Gu Si also admired ye Zao very much, but this matter was clearly ye Zao’s fault. ”

“If it weren’t for ye Zao’s objection to landing on Europa, Professor Feng and director Ma wouldn’t have rebelled. ”

But worship was worship!

These were two completely different things.

Gu Si hoped that ye Zao could see his mistake and give director Ma and Professor Feng Justice.

“”Team leader Cen, let me interject.”Elder sun coughed, then he said, “From an objective point of view, neither of you is wrong. Team leader Cen is right, Xiao Gu is also right, but Miss Ye’s misjudgment is the truth. Professor Feng and director Ma...” ”

“At this moment, a gasp of cold air suddenly sounded in the air! ”

“”Quick, look at the big screen!” ”

“Hearing this, everyone immediately looked at the screen and saw a few giant creatures appear on the live broadcast screen. ”

The appearance of the giant creatures was very strange.

“They looked like lobsters, but they had human legs. Their bodies were purplish red, and they were even bigger than elephants. ”

The three giants stared at the people below the spaceship as if they were looking at a few playthings.

“Professor Feng, director Ma, and the others were also shocked. Their faces were pale, and they stepped back. ”

“Fortunately, the Giants did not seem to be aggressive and just looked at them. ”

“At the same time, professor Feng suddenly hugged his neck. His facial features became distorted, and his expression was extremely painful! ”

“Professor Feng!”

Director Ma and Jack immediately squatted down.

“Professor Feng hugged his neck and squeezed out a few words from between his teeth, “Poison! Poison! The air is poisonous! Quickly put on the mask!” ”

Helmet!

Where was the helmet!

“Jack immediately handed the helmet over, “Director Ma, give it to me!” ”

“Director Ma took the helmet and put it on Professor Feng, then put on the helmet himself. ”

“After doing all this, director Ma pressed on the communicator and said, “Everyone, pay attention! Everyone, pay attention! The air on Europa is highly toxic! In addition, an unknown XENOGENEIC has appeared outside the spaceship. Immediately enter a state of Alert!” ”

“”Roger, Roger!”There was an immediate response from inside the spaceship. ”

The alarm sounded everywhere!

“Let’s Get Professor Feng into the Cabin First!”Director Ma and Jack helped Professor Feng Up from the ground.

The four of them were about to walk into the cabin.

PA —

“At this moment, the giant kicked at them. ”

Bang!

“Tom, who was next to them, was kicked to the ground. ”

“Run! Run quickly!”Director Ma saw that something was wrong and immediately gave the order.

The two of them supported Professor Feng and ran into the cabin with all their might.

“Suddenly, the roar of the giant came from the air. ”

Crash!

Another one!

Professor Feng was lifted up by the giant.

It was like carrying a toy.

“Director Ma was so scared that he was covered in cold sweat. He stood still and shouted, “Professor Feng!” ”
