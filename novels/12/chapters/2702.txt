Chapter 2703: 613: things have developed to the way they are now

Translator: 549690339

“In fact, things have developed to the way they are now, which is beyond ye Shu’s imagination.”

Ye Shu was also regretting it now.

“She regretted that when ye Sui came to the capital, she had forgotten about the pain after she recovered from her scar.”

“Ye Shu looked at ye Zao and continued, “Zao Zao, don’t worry. Mom Won’t be stupid again in the future.””

Ye Zao nodded.

“At this moment, Lin Jincheng continued, “Zao Zao, have you and Shaoqing been busy recently?”” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“”Yes, they have been busy.”Ye Zao continued, “There is a project on Mars that has some problems.””

“”Then what about your wedding date?”Recently, the Lin family had been preparing for their wedding. Lin Jincheng continued, “Have you discussed with Shaoqing whether the wedding should be postponed?””

Postponed?

“The corners of Ye Zhuo’s mouth curled up slightly. When Cen Shaoqing heard these words, he was afraid that he would cry.”

“”No need.”Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “No matter how busy I am, I can still find time to get married.””

“Hearing that the wedding could not be postponed, Lin Jincheng said, “Alright, then your mother and I will continue to prepare for the wedding.””

“”Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly, as if he had thought of something. “Oh right, Grandma Cen and Aunt Xiang will come tomorrow.””

There was a custom in the capital.

“Before the groom-to-be and the bride got married, there would be a betrothal letter and a gift.”

Lin Jincheng nodded. “I know that.”

“Ye Shu continued, “Your father and I have been discussing this matter since the day before yesterday! Zao Zao, will you be at home tomorrow?””

“”Cen Shaoqing and I will be at home in the morning,”ye Zao answered.”

“Are you still going to the base in the afternoon?”Lin Jincheng asked.

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Lin Jincheng continued, “Alright, then you should go and rest. You still have to wake up early tomorrow.””

“”Alright, Father and mother, you should rest early too,”ye Zhuo said.”

Lin Jincheng looked at ye Zhuo’s back and suddenly felt a little sad. He couldn’t help but tear up his eyes.

“Seeing him like this, ye Shu asked curiously, “What’s Wrong?””

“”I just suddenly feel a little uncomfortable.”Lin Jincheng wiped his eyes, “Why do girls have to get married when they grow up? Our Zao is usually busy. We don’t even see each other every three to five months. If we get married, we won’t see each other for three to four years!””

“As long as he thought of these things, Lin Jincheng felt very uncomfortable.”

“Ye Zao was the apple of his eye, but in the blink of an eye, she was going to become someone else’s apple.”

This was too unbearable!

“Ye Shu was also a little uncomfortable, but she still comforted him, “It won’t be. Even if Zao gets married, she’ll still be our daughter. This will always be her home. Even if she doesn’t have time to visit us, we can go visit her. How can we only see her once every three to five years! You’re exaggerating!””

“Hearing Ye Shu’s words, Lin Jincheng’s mood was slightly better.”

On the other side.

“After ye Sui sent a message to Ye Shu, not only did ye Shu not reply, but she was also blacklisted.”

“”Ziyue!”Ye Sui was furious. “Look at this B * Tch Ye Shu, she’s too much!””

“What’s Wrong?”Zhou Ziyue asked.

“Ye Sui continued, “She blacklisted me!””

“Blacklisted?”Zhou ziyue frowned.

“Yeah.”Ye Sui handed the phone to Zhou Ziyue. “Take a look for yourself.”

Zhou Ziyue took the phone and frowned. “This ye Shu is really daring!”

“What should we do now?”Ye Sui asked.

“Zhou Ziyue narrowed her eyes. “Since she’s heartless, don’t blame us for being unrighteous!””

“What do you plan to do?”Ye Sui asked.

“”I only have my way!”Zhou ziyue continued, “Don’t worry about it. If the news media calls you, just say that you two were close sisters when you were young. Later, she married a rich man and became like this.””

“Okay.”Ye Sui nodded.

Zhou Ziyue began to contact V-belt rhythm. She even said that she wanted to directly reveal the identity of her adopted daughter.

“”My grandparents’adopted daughter is Ye Shu, the wife of the CEO of the LIN Group.””

“After this message was sent to the other party, it was like a stone sinking into the ocean.”

The other party did not respond anymore.

Zhou ziyue frowned slightly.

What was going on?

“Zhou Ziyue contacted other media outlets, but the result was still the same.”

What was going on?

Could it be that the Lin family used their power to suppress the news?

“In the end, she had underestimated the power of capital.”

Zhou Ziyue still did not give up. She logged into her account and planned to shoot a new video to upload.

The main characters of the video were still ye Dafu and Yao Cuifen.

Ye Dafu and Yao Cuifen cried so hard that they could not help themselves.

“In the end.., they still pretended to say, “Actually, we just want to see our daughter. Since she doesn’t want to see us, then forget it. This means that our mother-daughter relationship, our father-daughter relationship, has come to an end! It has reached a point where we can not stay! Please Don’t blame her. No matter what, we were once a family. She will always be our daughter!””

“These words could be said to be extremely harsh, causing the netizens in front of the video to burst into tears. They could not help but sigh at how strong the love of a father and mother was!”

“The adopted daughter already had no conscience. However, as parents, under such circumstances, not only did they not blame the adopted daughter, they even pleaded for the adopted daughter!”

“[ this is too much! who exactly is the adopted daughter! Why is it that after so many days, we still haven’t found out! ]”

[ I’m so angry that I haven’t eaten for an entire day! ]

“[ uncle and aunt, don’t be anxious. Good will be rewarded for good and evil will be rewarded for evil. It’s not that the time hasn’t come yet. ]”

“[ according to reliable sources, the adopted daughter is the mistress of a prominent family in the capital. Her children are all very outstanding. I really didn’t expect such a person to actually have children! ]”

[ ... ]

“In just a few minutes, public opinion had reached an uncontrollable stage.”

“Next, it was time to expose ye Shu’s identity!”

“Thinking of this, Zhou Ziyue narrowed her eyes.”

Just wait!

“Soon, Ye Shu would have a taste of being exposed online.”

“Lying on the sofa, Zhou Ziyue slowly flipped through the comments. She felt that something was wrong. There were more and more new comments. This time, not only were the new comments not scolding ye Shu, but...”

They were scolding them!

What was going on?

“”Damn it, I was wondering why I didn’t see my adopted daughter appear. I also didn’t see the name of this family! If I didn’t see it with my own eyes, who would believe that there would be such a shameless person in the world! It’s so disgusting!””

“You made me waste so much sympathy!”

“”You consumed the sympathy of the masses and even tried to stir up public opinion. Do you really think that everyone is blind? You want to use us as guns, right?””

“”Brothers!”! The identities of these two old men had already been exposed! Ye Dafu and Yao Cuifen had previously forced Mrs. Lin to sever her relationship with them. This time, if we hadn’t discovered it in time, Mrs. Lin might have been smeared by them!””

[ two animals! They don’t deserve to be someone else’s parents! ]

“[ there are probably many people who don’t know the whole story! ]! Then, I’ll repeat it for everyone. These two old geezers are called ye Dafu and Yao Cuifen. Thirty-eight years ago, the Scum Xi Muwen gave his biological daughter to this couple for adoption and gave them a huge amount of child support! Because they were not related by blood, this couple beat and scolded Mrs. Lin. When Mrs. Lin was still underage, they were chased out of the house by these two scumbags! Not only that, these two scumbags even almost sold Mrs. Lin to an old wealthy businessman. Later on, Mrs. Lin could not bear the burden and directly cut off her finger and cut off her relationship with them! Now, these two shameless things actually had the nerve to come knocking on her door... “... “...””

“Zhou Ziyue didn’t understand how things had turned out like this. As she watched, her body couldn’t help but tremble, and there wasn’t the slightest bit of color on her face.”

“”Also, the people who released this video are these two granddaughters, their names are Zhou Ziyue. Speaking of this Zhou Ziyue, compared to those two beasts, she was simply better than them! Even though she had a boyfriend, she was still going on a blind date with a tall, rich, and handsome man in the circle of Beijing! She thought that she hid it well, but she didn’t know that in the eyes of the tall, rich, and handsome man, she was just a clown! Disgusting to the extreme”

..

More and more similar comments were made.

Zhou Ziyue couldn’t sit still.

“At this moment, ye Sui ran over excitedly with his phone in hand. “Ziyue, Ziyue, have you looked at your phone? !””

Zhou Ziyue didn’t say anything.

“Ye Sui continued, “The number of reposts has exceeded 100 million! These ye Shu can’t get up anymore! Our family is really going to post it!””

“When these words fell into Zhou Ziyue’s ears, she only felt that it was very ironic.”

“Have you looked at the comments?”Zhou Ziyue looked at ye Sui.

She understood now!

She finally understood!

She understood why ye Shu dared to block ye Sui’s wechat.

“Comments?”Ye Sui was stunned. “What comments?”

“Naturally, the comments were all for them!”

“”We’re finished,”Zhou Ziyue said expressionlessly.”

“If ye Sui observed carefully, he could see that Zhou Ziyue’s face was frighteningly pale.”
