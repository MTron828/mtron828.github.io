Translator: 549690339

“This was a five-story villa. After careful decoration, the inside and outside of the villa were filled with joy. ”

“The Lin family had many relatives and brothers. At this moment, the villa was bustling with activity. ”

Lin Qingxuan’s marriage was a major event.

“Other than old Mrs. Lin who was not present, all the other relatives and friends of the Lin family were present. ”

“When Ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing arrived, Lin Qingxuan and the rest had already prepared everything. They were just waiting for the auspicious time to come and pick up the bride. ”

Lin Qingxuan was in high spirits when it came to happy events. All the happiness was written on her face.

“Ye Zhuo smiled as he walked in front of Lin Qingxuan. “Fourth uncle, Congratulations. You’ve finally achieved what you wanted.” ”

“Lin Qingxuan looked at Ye Zhuo. “Zhuo Zhuo, I still have to thank you. If it wasn’t for your words that woke up the person in my dreams, how would fourth Uncle Be Here Now?”To Lin Qingxuan.., ye Zao was like a life-saving straw that a drowning person would encounter. ”

“If it weren’t for ye Zao’s timely advice, he might not have been able to see the truth until now. ”

“Therefore, the person that Lin Qingxuan was most grateful to was ye Zao. ”

“At 8:08 am, more than 30 luxury cars left the villa on time. ”

Xia family.

Ye Shu accompanied Xia Xiaoman as they sat in front of the dressing table.

Xia Xiaoman looked at herself in the mirror in her pure white wedding dress and felt that everything was so surreal. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“An Lizi walked over and asked, “Mom, are you nervous now?” ”

“Xia Xiaoman smiled and said, “I’m okay.” ”

“At this moment, the sound of firecrackers came from downstairs. ”

An Lizi hurriedly stood up. “They’re here! They’re here!”

“Hearing this, Xia Xiaoman became even more nervous. ”

“Her first marriage was very sloppy. She didn’t even take any wedding photos. On the day of her wedding, she wore a red gown and walked to the an family home. ”

Although this was her second marriage.

Many of her experiences were her first.

“Ye Shu reached out and held Xia Xiaoman’s hand. “Sister Xiaoman, don’t be nervous.” ”

“After saying that, ye Shu continued, “Oh no, I should call her fourth sister-in-law now.” ”

“Xia Xiaoman’s face blushed. “Ah Shu, you’re teasing me too.” ”

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “This is the truth! How can it be called teasing?” ”

“An Lizi came to the window and looked downstairs. As expected, Lin Qingxuan and the others had come over. ”

“At this moment, an Lizi’s uncle was receiving them. ”

“Ye Shu looked at an Lizi. “Lizi, we can’t let your uncle Lin in so casually later. He’s the groom today. We have to ask him for more red packets.” ”

“An Lizi nodded and smiled. “I know, Aunty.” ”

“As soon as she said this, there was a knock on the door. ”

“Who is it?”Ye Shu asked deliberately.

“”It’s me! Fifth Sister-in-law, I’m here to bring Xiaoman home.”Lin Qingxuan’s voice came from outside the door. ”

“Ye Shu looked at an Lizi, who immediately understood and said, “Uncle Lin, if you want to take my mother home, don’t you have to show some sincerity?” ”

Lin Qingxuan immediately stuffed the red packets through the crack in the door. “Is this enough?”

“Not Enough.”

Lin Qingxuan stuffed some more red packets into the crack in the door.

“Ye Shu made things difficult for Lin Qingxuan again, and only then did she let an Lizi Open the door. ”

There was a group of people standing outside.

“Lin Qingxuan stood at the front with flowers in his hands. “Xiaoman, I’m here to take you home!” ”

“Xia Xiaoman reached out to take the flowers, her face bashful. ”

There were people at the side who jeered at Lin Qingxuan for him to confess.

“It was hard for Lin Qingxuan, a man in his forties, to be so bashful at this moment that he looked like a young boy in his twenties. ”

An Lizi walked to ye Zao’s side and tugged at ye Zao’s hand. “Big Zao Zao!”

“Lizi.”

“An lizi continued, “Zao Zao, why do I Feel Like This Is All a dream! is my mother really together with your fourth uncle?”Not only was Xia Xiaoman feeling incredulous, even an Lizi felt that things had developed too quickly. ”

“She had never thought that one day, she and ye Zao would become cousins and become a family. ”

“Ye Zao said, “Of course it’s true. From now on, we’ll be a family.” ”

“After saying that, ye Zao tilted his head and looked at Cen Shaoqing. “Let me introduce you. This is your cousin, an Lizi.” ”

Cousin.

“Upon hearing this address, Cen Shaoqing nearly choked on his blood. ”

His seniority in the Ye family was already low enough. He did not expect ye Zao to arrange another cousin for him.

It seemed that it was impossible for him to turn things around in the Ye family.

“”Cousin.”Cen Shaoqing held the Buddha bead in his hand, his expression still the same. ”

“How could an Lizi Bear being addressed as cousin by Cen Shaoqing? She hurriedly said, “Mr. Cen, you’re too polite! Actually, you don’t have to call me cousin. Just call me by my name!” ”
