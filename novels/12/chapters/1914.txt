It wished that this was only a dream.

“After waking up from the dream, Ye Zhuo was still there, and Ye Han was still the ye Han of the past. ”

“”Ye Han, do you really not remember the past?”Yi ling cried and said, “Could it be that you’ve Forgotten Miss Ye? You said that you have to repay Miss Ye, that you have to treat miss ye well for the rest of your life...” ”

“Looking at Yi Ling, Ye Han felt that his head was hurting more and more. ”

It was very uncomfortable.

That feeling was as if something was about to rush out of his mind.

“Seeing ye Han like this, Qiu di frowned slightly. Yi Ling knew everything that happened between Ye Han and Ye Zhuo. ”

No.

She couldn’t let it continue speaking.

“Shut it up!”Qiu Di immediately followed up.

“Yes.”Ye Han slightly changed and threw out a piece of paper.

Pa..

“In the next second, the paper was directly pasted on Yi Ling’s mouth, making it unable to say a single word. ”

“Yi Ling struggled furiously, but it was not ye Han’s match at all. ”

“It could be said that other than ye Zhuo, no one could think of defeating ye Han! ”

“After all, Ye Han was groomed by Ye Zhuo. ”

“Qiu Di walked in front of Yi Ling, bent down and pinched its wings, lifting it up. “Yi Ling, things are really not what you think, I...” ”

“Saying this, Qiu di sighed and continued, “Forget it, Wu Han.” ”

“Eldest miss.”Ye Han took a step forward.

“Qiu di said, “Take it down and lock it up.” ”

“Yes.”Ye Han took Yi Ling from Qiu Di’s hands.

“Ten minutes later, the clothes spirit was locked in a transparent glass bottle. ”

The clothes spirit’s biggest weakness was its fear of the dense and narrow space. What Ye Han did was simply more cruel than directly killing it.

“The clothes spirit stood helplessly in the sealed bottle, slapping the sound of the bottle. “Let me out, quickly let me out! Ye Han, you big traitor, you’ve been deceived, do you know that? !” ”

“Unfortunately, the bottle had been processed. Other than the clothes spirit’s voice, no one else could hear it. ”

“Very soon, Ye Han returned to Autumn Flute’s office again. ”

Autumn flute raised his eyes slightly. “Locked up?”

“”Yes,”ye Han answered. ” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Autumn flute continued, “Don’t you want to know why the clothes spirit said that?” ”

“No.”Ye Han shook his head.

Everything that had nothing to do with Qiu Di was a trivial matter that was not worth mentioning.

“Therefore, he did not care about the spirit coat’s words and actions. ”

Qiu Di nodded in satisfaction. “Go out.”

“Yes.”Ye Han walked out.

Qiu Di went back to the battle suit hanging on the clothes rack.

“Without the spirit coat, the entire battle suit lost its luster. ”

Qiu Di narrowed his eyes and sent a message to ye Lan.

Ye Lan was one of ye Zao’s subordinates.

“Soon, Ye Lan arrived. ”

“Miss Qiu Di.”

“Not only was ye Lan Ye Zao’s subordinate, but if one looked closely, one could also see a trace of ye Zao in Ye Lan’s facial features. ”

“But if one looked closely, one could not see anything. ”

“Seeing ye Lan, Qiu di nodded and told ye Lan about the spirit coat. ”

“Hearing this, ye LAN continued, “Then I’ll go and try.” ”

“Okay.”

Ye Lan came to the place where Yi Ling was imprisoned.

“Little Ling Ling.”

“Hearing a familiar voice, Yi Ling immediately opened her eyes. The moment she opened her eyes, she saw ye Lan. In a trance, Yi Ling thought she saw ye Zhuo and said excitedly, “Great burning!” ”

God knows how excited Yi Ling was right now. All the grievances disappeared completely at this moment.

That was great!

Ye Zao had finally returned.

“Yi Ling looked at Ye Lan with tears in her eyes. She held onto the bottle and said, “Great Zao Zao, I knew you would be fine. SOB SOB SOB... it’s great that you’re back...”if this was a dream, please let it never wake up. ”

“”Great Zao Zao, these few days when you weren’t around, they all bullied me...”Yi Ling wanted to say all the grievances she had suffered in one go. ”

“Unfortunately, its language ability was limited, so it was unable to say all the grievances in one go. ”

“”It’s me, Little Ling Ling,”ye LAN continued, “Are You Alright?” ”

This voice...

Seemed to be a little off.

Yi Ling paused and raised its head to look at Ye Lan. Only then did it realize that it had recognized the wrong person.

So it was ye Lan.

Yi Ling was instantly extremely disappointed.

“However, in the next second, it revived again. After all, Ye Lan was also ye burning’s subordinate. ”

“”Ye Lan, why are you here? Did you know? Ye Han has already betrayed us!” ”

“Ye Lan said, “Ye Han hasn’t betrayed us.” ”

“What?”Yi Ling stared at her with wide eyes.

“”Listen to me slowly,”ye Lan said unhurriedly, “Actually, when Miss Ye entered the laboratory, she already predicted the danger, so she handed over all her matters to Miss Qiu Di, including Ye Han.” ”
