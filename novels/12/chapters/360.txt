This trip to Country P.

It was worth it.

“Ye Zhuo walked in front, and at this moment, a few naughty children rushed out from inside. ”

“While dodging, she stumbled and almost fell. ”

“Cen Shaoqing quickly reached out and grabbed her waist, pulling it to the side. ”

A very thin waist.

It was much thinner than he had imagined.

It was so smooth that he could hold it.

“Even though they were separated by a thin layer of clothing, they could still feel each other’s warmth. ”

“Cen Shaoqing was in a daze for a moment. He quickly let go of her and reminded, “Take care of your feet.” ”

Ye Zhuo was a little embarrassed.

She had always been good at fighting. She was always the one who reminded others.

This was the first time she was reminded by others.

Ye Sen glanced over and the corners of his mouth curled up slightly.

How could he not have noticed it before.

His eldest niece and Cen Shaoqing looked more and more compatible when they stood together.

They were simply a match made in heaven!

It was already one o’clock in the afternoon when they returned from the restaurant.

“Cen Shaoqing did not return to the Cen family manor directly. Instead, he went to the company. ”

“When he knew that Cen Shaoqing was back today, Li Qiandong had been waiting at the door of Cen Shaoqing’s office since early in the morning. ”

“”Fifth brother, you’re finally back.” ”

Cen Shaoqing held the Buddhist beads in his hand and his expression was the same as ever. “What happened?”

“Li Qiandong passed the document in his hand to Cen Shaoqing with an unsightly expression. “Recently, those Old Fellows have been very restless!” ”

Cen Shaoqing flipped through the document and his thin lips curled up slightly. “A grasshopper after autumn is nothing to be afraid of.”

“His voice was very light, but for some reason, it made people’s hearts tremble. ”

It was obvious that he did not take this matter to heart.

“Seeing Cen Shaoqing like this, Li Qiandong heaved a sigh of relief. “Fifth brother, I see that you’re in a good mood. Have you encountered any good things recently?” ”

“I seem to be in a good mood?”Cen Shaoqing raised his eyes.

“Yes!”Li Qiandong nodded.

Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads and narrowed his eyes.

“Li Qiandong continued, “Right, fifth brother, I have something to show you.” ”

“What?”Cen Shaoqing raised his eyebrows.

“Li Qiandong took out his phone and opened a video. “Fifth brother, look at this.” ”

“In the video, a white coach car was speeding along the S curve of the driving school. ”

The speed was very fast.

All kinds of thrilling and exciting actions took place one after another.

Everyone who watched it heaved a sigh of relief.

“Perhaps no one knew that apart from reciting Buddhist scriptures, Cen Shaoqing had another hobby, racing cars. ”

Cen Shaoqing raised his eyebrows slightly.

“The racing blood in his body, which had been dormant for many years, was now boiling again. ”

He suddenly had the urge to compete with the person in the video.

“After a video was played, Li Qiandong said, “How is it, fifth brother? This person’s skills are pretty good, right?” ”

“Is she a newly promoted racer?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“Li Qiandong shook his head slightly. “I don’t know her either, but I heard that she’s a female driver! She’s a student from this driving school!” ”

Cen Shaoqing narrowed his eyes. “She doesn’t look like a newbie.”

“”Brother Five, take a look at this again.”Li Qiandong swiped the screen of his phone and another scene immediately appeared. ”

This was the image of a young woman walking towards the driving school.

This woman was none other than Mu Yourong.

It was Mu Yourong.

Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly. “What are you trying to express?”

“Li Qiandong continued, “Fifth brother, I heard that Miss Mu’s driving skills are very good. It’s just that she hasn’t gotten her driver’s license yet. Do you think this racer could be her?” ”

Li Qiandong had found out by chance that Mu Yourong was also at that driving school.

Mu Yourong was extremely intelligent and had a good appearance. It was very normal for her to know how to race!

“Therefore, this person was definitely mu yourong. ”

“It’s not her.”Cen Shaoqing’s tone was firm.

Although CEN Shaoqing did not see clearly who was in the car.

But he was certain that this person was definitely not Mu Yourong. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Li Qiandong said, “That might not be the case. Fifth Brother, your prejudice against Miss Mu is too deep!” ”

“Do you like Mu Yourong very much?”

Li Qiandong was stunned for a moment before he hurriedly shook his head. “No! I don’t like her!”A brother’s wife should not be bullied!

He still understood this point.

“Moreover, he was not worthy of such a good girl like Mu Yourong. ”

“Li Qiandong continued, “Fifth brother, actually, Miss Mu is really very outstanding! Not only does she know how to get stuck in traffic, she is also very caring. She goes to the Welfare Institute to visit the children almost once a week!” ”

“In this world, how many girls could do what Mu Yourong did? ”

Cen Shaoqing raised his eyes to look at Li Qiandong. “Being played around by a woman! I think you’re as stupid as a pig!”

“As he finished speaking, he pointed to the door and said, “Get lost!” ”

His deep voice seemed to be covered in a layer of ice.

It was a tone that could not be tolerated.

Li Qiandong’s heart jumped and he immediately walked out of the door. How would he dare to utter a single word?

Why was Cen Shaoqing so angry?

Could it be that he was angry and jealous because he kept mentioning Mu Yourong by his side?

“Li Qiandong scratched his head, feeling that it was very possible. ”

“Perhaps CEN Shaoqing had already taken an invisible liking to Mu Yourong, but he had not even realized it. ”

..

In the capital.

Lin Ze had already returned for almost a week.

“He remembered Ye Sen’s words. In these past few days, Lin Ze had been searching for traces of his mother. ”

“Since his mother had once lived in Beijing and given birth to him, she could not possibly leave behind not a single trace. ”

“Other than searching for traces in the Lin family’s old residence, Lin Ze was also planning how to get his mother’s name from Old Lady Lin. ”

“Meow.”A chubby cat rubbed Lin ze’s calf.

Lin Ze bent down and picked it up. “Brother Meow.”

He walked out of the door while carrying the cat.

He just happened to bump into Feng Xianxian walking in from outside. “Brother Ah Ze!”

Feng Xianxian greeted Lin Ze with a smile on her face.

Lin Ze carried the cat as if he didn’t see Feng Xianxian. He walked past her without even giving her a glance.

Feng Xianxian bit her lip and her gaze fell on the cat in Lin Ze’s arms. Her eyes were filled with malice.

The Bastard carried the wild cat.

Wait!

“One day, she would make these two beasts disappear from the Lin family. ”
