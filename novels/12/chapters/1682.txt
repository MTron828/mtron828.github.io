Lin Sha was stunned when she saw Zou Feifei.

“Zou feifei smiled and said, “Sha Sha, you don’t know me! I’m Zou Feifei. We met at Uncle and aunty’s shop before. My father’s name is Zou Dabiao.” ”

“Lin Sha had an impression of him when he said that. She smiled and said, “So it’s Miss Zou. Hello.” ”

“Zou Dabiao was a financial magnate in Yunjing City. When Lin Jinshui was unable to make money, he had once borrowed a loan from Zou Dabiao. Zou Feifei was Zou Dabiao’s only daughter, and Zou Dabiao regarded her as the apple of his eye, before this, Zou Feifei also had the look of an arrogant and pampered daughter. She looked down on those who borrowed money from her family. Unexpectedly, after not seeing her for a while, Zou Feifei seemed to have changed into a different person. ”

“Zou feifei said, “I’m just an ordinary person. Shasha, you can just call me by my name. By the way, who is this?” ”

“Lin Shasha introduced, “This is my good friend Ye Zhuo. Zhuo Zhuo, this is Zou Feifei.” ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly to Zou Feifei. “Hello.”

“”Hello.”Zou feifei continued, “By the way, let me introduce you two. This is my good friend, Ning Lan.” ”

“After the four of them got to know each other, Zou Feifei continued, “Shasha, are you and your friend taking the college entrance exam here too?” ”

“Lin Sha said, “My friend is here to accompany me on the college entrance exam.” ”

“She’s not taking the exam?”Zou Feifei was a little surprised.

“Judging from ye Zhuo’s appearance, he was only seventeen or eighteen years old. Could it be that she did not go to school at such a young age and entered society? ”

“But thinking about it, it was normal. ”

“Lin Sha was already twenty-two years old this year before taking the college entrance exam. Before that, she was just a factory girl. ”

No one knew what was wrong with her. She suddenly did not want to work in the factory and came over to take the college entrance exam to snatch resources from young girls like them.

Birds of a feather flock together.

“Lin Sha smiled and said, “My friend is already a third-year student.” ”

Third-year student?

“Ning Lan said in surprise, “I really couldn’t tell. I thought you were like us, a third-year student! Then how old are you this year?” ”

Ye Zhuo smiled faintly. “Eighteen years old.”

“A hint of disdain flashed in Zou Feifei’s eyes. He then said, “Let’s go to the exam room first, shall we? Sha Sha, which exam room are you in?” ”

“Lin Sha said, “Exam room 036. What About You?” ”

“Zou feifei said in surprise, “What a coincidence! I’m in Room 035!” ”

“Then let’s go together.”

“Okay.”Zou feifei nodded.

The four of them walked towards the exam room together.

Exam Room 035 was next to exam room 036.

“Zou feifei stopped and said, “Shasha, then we’ll go in first.” ”

“”Okay.”Lin Shasha nodded and turned to look at Ye Zhuo. “Zhuozhuo, let’s go over there.” ”

Ye Zao and Lin Sha walked towards exam room 036 together.

“At this moment, there were already some people gathered in the exam room. ”

“Seeing Lin Sha and ye Zao come over, everyone looked at them curiously, and then they were amazed. ”

“Teenage boys and girls always yearned for and were curious about beautiful things, especially beauties! ”

Ye Zao was too outstanding.

“A boy mustered up his courage and went forward to add him on wechat. “Student, can you add me on wechat?” ”

“Ye Zao looked back slightly. “I’m sorry, I don’t have wechat.” ”

“The boy also knew that she was tactfully rejecting him, so he smiled and said, “It’s okay.” ” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“After watching the exam hall, the two of them saw Zou Feifei and ning Lan waiting under the camphor tree not far away from them. ”

“Ye Zao whispered, “Sister Shasha.” ”

“”Yes, What’s Wrong?”Lin Shasha tilted her head and looked at ye Zao. ”

“Ye Zao continued, “This Zou Feifei must have a motive for suddenly approaching you. Be careful.” ”

“”Ah?”Lin Shasha asked in surprise, “Really?” ”

“Ye Zao nodded slightly, “Now is the crucial time of the college entrance exam. It’s not a bad thing for you to be careful.” ”

“Okay.”

“After ye Zao and the others left, the exam room was full of discussion. ”

“Which school did that girl go to?”

“She’s so pretty! I’ve never heard of her before!”

“”I think she looks familiar, but I can’t remember where I’ve seen her before!” ”

“...”

Over here.

“Zou Feifei saw ye Zao and Lin Sha walking over and immediately came up to them. “Sasha, it’s still early. Let’s go have dinner together.” ”

“Lin Shasha had always trusted ye Zhuo. Ye Zhuo had said that Zou feifei was up to no good, so she smiled and declined. “I’m sorry, Feifei. We have something to do later, so we might not be able to have dinner together.” ”

Zou feifei frowned. “It’s okay. Let’s have dinner together again sometime.”
