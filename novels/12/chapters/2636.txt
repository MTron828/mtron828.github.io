The house he just bought.

This sentence made Zhou Cuihua and Li Hang stunned.

Could it be... Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Li Dalong sold the house?

How could this be possible!

It couldn’t be.

“Especially Li Hang, her face was pale. Li Dalong loved her the most. He even said before that his house would all be Li Hang in the future! ”

How could Li da long sell his house secretly!

Impossible!

“”This is my house! I Am the mistress of this house!”Zhou cui hua continued, “How come I didn’t know when this house was sold!” ”

Zhou Cui Hua was very emotional. She pushed away the man in front of the door and walked inside.

The house was still the same layout as before.

Even the words “Blessing”that hung on the door during the new year were still left on the door.

“Seeing this scene, Zhou Cuihua’s eyes turned hot. ”

It was very uncomfortable.

She also wanted to return to Li Dalong’s side more and more.

“”What’s the matter with you guys? Why are you casually running to other people’s Houses!”The man was so angry that he took out his phone and was about to call the police. “If you guys don’t Leave Now, I’m going to call the police!” ”

“”This is my house!”Zhou cuihua pointed at the sofa and said, “I personally chose this sofa and this dining table. Do you know what brand this is? It’s imported from country R! Is it illegal for me to enter my own house?” ”

The man was so angry that his face turned red.

He had bought this house a month ago.

“He heard that the original owner had originally planned to renovate the house and live in it again. Then, for some unknown reason, he sold the house directly. ”

The 105-square-meter house was sold for more than 18 million yuan.

“After paying the money, he was short of money, so he did not renovate it anymore. He did not expect that a lunatic would come today. ”

The man immediately called the police.

“”Hello, is this 110?” ”

“Someone broke into our house!”

“The police in Beijing were very efficient. In less than ten minutes, a uniformed policeman came to the door. ”

“Who called the police?”

“”Me.”The man who called the police immediately went forward and handed in his identity card. “Hello, Officer. My name is Shen liangqi, the owner of this house. I don’t know where these two people came from, but they insisted that this is their home!” ”

“After saying that, the man continued, “This is my property certificate.” ”

“The police took Shen Liangqi’s identity card and property certificate. After taking a look, he turned to look at Zhou Cuihua and Li Hang. “Take out your identity cards and let me see them!” ”

“Zhou cuihua said, “Officer, don’t be fooled by them! My name is Zhou Cuihua. I am the real owner of this house.” ”

“The policeman looked at the few of them and then said, “Stop arguing. Come with me to the police station first.” ”

The few of them were taken to the police station.

“Soon, the matter was cleared up by the police. ”

“”Zhou cuihua, Li Hang, we have investigated the matter clearly.”A police officer walked in front of the two of them, “The house in unit 3305, Block 103, Unit 7, on Yun Hua Road has been sold by Li Da Long. The current buyer is Zhang Ye.” ”

Sold.

Li Da Long actually sold the house!

Li hang could not accept this fact for a moment. How could Li da long sell the house!

It could not be!

“”Comrade police officer, you are mistaken. You must be mistaken! Li Da Long is my father! I am his only daughter. He will not sell the house!”Li Hang said anxiously. ”

“The police officer continued, “The house has indeed been sold. If you don’t believe me, you can call your father to verify it.” ”

“Hearing this, Zhou Cui Hua immediately took out her phone and dialed Li Da Long’s number. ”

The call went through very quickly.

“Hello.”It was a very gentle female voice.

Li Hang was stunned and didn’t say anything.

“A voice came from the other end again. “It’s hang hang, right?” ”

Li hang still did not say anything.

She knew that the person on the other end of the phone was Feng Juan.

“At this moment, Li Hang was already beginning to regret. She should not have promised Li da long to let him be with Feng Juan in the first place. ”

Regret.

Very Regret.

“Feng Juan continued, “Hang Hang, are you looking for your dad? Wait a moment, he’s taking a shower.” ”

Taking a shower?

That meant that Feng Juan had already moved in with Li Da Long?

Li Hang’s face was extremely pale.

“Feng Juan continued, “Hang Hang, why aren’t you saying anything? Why are you looking for your dad? Tell me, I’ll tell your dad.” ”

“Li hang held his phone like this, but he still did not say anything. ”

“Zhou Cui Hua, who was at the side, also felt a little strange. She looked at Li hang and said, “Why aren’t you saying anything?” ”

“Li hang turned his head to look at Zhou Cui Hua, not knowing what to say. ”

“Zhou cuihua took Li Hang’s phone and directly asked, “Li Dalong, what’s wrong with you? Why did you sell the House?” ”
