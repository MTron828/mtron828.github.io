Translator: 549690339

“It’s true.”Butler song looked at Doctor Liu with a serious expression.

“Actually, Butler song still couldn’t believe it. ”

How did Chen Siyao disappear? !

He had always thought that Chen Siyao was just scaring song Shiyu. He didn’t expect...

“Doctor Liu looked at Butler song for a long time before he said, “When did this happen?” ”

“”Three days ago,”Butler song replied. ”

Doctor Liu stood where he was and didn’t say anything. He felt very upset.

“A few days ago, he had talked to Chen Siyao. He even left a first aid kit for Chen Siyao and told her to use it immediately if she couldn’t hold on any longer. ”

“”So, Boss song just watched her do something stupid?”Doctor Liu looked at Butler song and asked. ”

Butler song sighed.

“A moment later, Butler song continued, “Chen Siyao is an adult now. She should know in her heart what path she chose. Third Master has no obligation to help her.” ”

“In other words, Chen Siyao’s death had nothing to do with song Shiyu. ”

“If one had to say that there was a connection, it would be a moral kidnapping. ”

“Doctors were benevolent. Although what he said was right, doctor Liu still couldn’t accept it. “After all, that’s a human life. Boss song just needs to say a word and it can be saved!” ”

“”Then what about in the future?”Butler song asked. “There will be one and two, and three and four. What if Chen Siyao uses the same method to threaten third master next time?” ”

Doctor Liu was silent for a moment.

“Butler song sighed. “I watched Miss Chen grow up. I’m also very sad that something happened to her, but it has already happened! Maybe this is her fate!” ”

Wasn’t there a saying?

“Everything was fate, and it was not up to anyone. ”

“After saying that, housekeeper song added, “Adults should pay for their own choices.” ”

Doctor Liu did not speak anymore and just followed in housekeeper song’s footsteps.

Housekeeper song brought doctor Liu to the room and took out a suitcase to give to doctor Liu. “Third master asked me to give this to you.”

“What’s This?”Doctor Liu asked.

“Housekeeper song smiled and said, “Open it when you go back.” ”

Doctor Liu nodded. “Help me thank boss song.”

“”Okay, I’ll definitely pass on the message,”housekeeper song said. ”

Doctor Liu carried the suitcase and left.

“Housekeeper song watched Doctor Liu’s back. There was an indescribable expression in his eyes. After a long while, he let out a long sigh. ”

“If song Shiyu had been like Doctor Liu, perhaps Chen Siyao wouldn’t have died. ”

But there were no ifs in this world.

“In a moment, Butler song turned around and left. ”

“After returning home, doctor Liu opened the suitcase that Butler song had given him. ”

There was a painting and a card inside. The password was on the back of the card.

Doctor Liu opened the painting.

It was a landscape painting by Wu Rao.

“Wu Rao was a painter of the new era. It was said that he was born after the 1990s and was very young. However, although he was young, his brushwork was very good and the things he drew were full of meaning. Therefore, he was sought after by many people. ”

Doctor Liu was the intention of Wu Rao’s many fans. It had to be said that song Shiyu’s gift was really popular.

Doctor Liu looked at the landscape painting carefully. His eyes were filled with amazement. He had liked the painting for a long time. He had never thought that he would one day be able to have a hand-drawn painting that did not disturb him.

“He did not expect song Shiyu to look cold and indifferent. He looked like he did not care about anything at all. In private, he was quite meticulous. ”

“Doctor Liu looked at the painting over and over again. In the end, he carefully placed it in the box. Finally, he took out his phone and called Butler song. ”

The call was answered very quickly. Butler song’s voice came from the other end. “Doctor Liu.”

“Doctor Liu continued, “Hello, Butler song. I’ve seen the item. I like it very much. Please help me convey my gratitude to boss song.” ”

“”Okay,”Butler song continued, “Third Master will definitely be very happy to know that you like it so much.” ”

“After hanging up, Butler song went to Song Shiyu’s study. ”

He knocked on the door.

“Soon, song Shiyu’s voice came from inside. “Come in.” ”

The Butler pushed the door open and entered. He saw song Shiyu looking down at his phone with earphones on his ears.

“From the looks of it, he was probably playing a game. ”

Butler song was already used to this scene.

He had seen song Shiyu form a team more than once. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“”Boss,”Butler song continued, “Dr. Liu has received the things you prepared for him. He just called and asked me to thank you.” ”
