“Bai Jingshu was the daughter that she carried for ten months. If it weren’t for her, there wouldn’t be Bai Jingshu. ”

“But now, Bai Jingshu was going to sever all ties with her over a small matter. ”

What kind of daughter was this?

Zhou Ying couldn’t accept it. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“If it were in the past, Bai Jingshu might have been moved by this sentence. After all, Zhou Ying was still her mother. But Now? ”

No.

“”Was it just a small mistake?”Bai Jingshu’s face was expressionless, she continued, “If grandfather hadn’t arrived in time, I would already be a clone! Ms. Zhou, I’ve already been very tolerant of you. Please have some self-respect and don’t make everyone look bad.” ”

“After saying this, Bai Jingshu turned to look at Lin Ze. “Let’s go.” ”

“Okay.”Lin Ze nodded slightly. He held Bai Jingshu’s arm and walked into the aircraft.

“Bai Jiacheng and Zhou Ying looked at their backs. For a moment, they did not know how to react. ”

“They thought that Bai Jingshu had a soft personality and was easy to manipulate. Lin Ze was also their new son-in-law, so the two of them would definitely forgive them. ”

“However, they did not expect Bai Jingshu to turn out like this! ”

Ingrate!

Bai Jingshu was an ingrate who had no humanity. Even a crow knew how to reciprocate and repay the kindness of her upbringing. Bai Jingshu was simply worse than a crow.

“Bai Jiasheng wanted to curse, but he held back. ”

“Zhou Ying looked like she was about to cry. She turned to look at Bai Jiasheng. “Jiasheng, what should we do now?” ”

“”Let’s go back first,”Bai Jiasheng said. ”

Zhou Ying nodded and followed Bai Jiasheng’s footsteps.

On the other side.

At the Bai family’s old residence.

Lin Ze and Bai Jingshu had just alighted from the aircraft when they saw Bai Mo and Old Master Bai standing at the door.

Lin Ze alighted from the aircraft first and held Bai Jingshu’s hand as they walked down in a gentlemanly manner.

“When two people like these stood together, it was as if they were as compatible as they could be. Old Master Bai looked at the two of them and the corners of his mouth curled up slightly. His eyes were filled with kindness. ”

He was very happy that he could personally see Bai Jingshu find someone she could be with for the rest of her life.

“With that, he would be at ease even if he closed his eyes. ”

“Elder Bai looked down at Bai Mo and said with a smile, “Look at how compatible the two of them are!” ”

Compatible?

Lin Ze and Bai Jingshu were very compatible?

“Hearing this, Bai Mo’s heart was about to bleed. ”

Did elder Bai forget something.

She had met Lin Ze first.

“If Bai Jingshu had not interfered, she would be the one walking with Lin Ze now. ”

“But now, not only did elder Bai not care about her feelings, he even had to say such things in front of her. ”

“Bai Mo had mixed feelings, but she still nodded with a smile and echoed, “Yes, my sister and brother-in-law are a perfect match.” ”

“As they spoke, Bai Jingshu and Lin Ze had already walked up to elder Bai. ”

“For some reason, Bai Mo had never felt anything when she looked at Lin Ze in the past. But now, as Lin ze got closer and closer to her, her heart was beating faster and faster. ”

This feeling was very strange.

“Bai Mo gulped, and both sides of her face unconsciously turned red. She took a few steps forward and looked up at Lin Ze. ”

“The sunlight shone on the man’s eyes, and it was a little too cold. ”

“No matter which angle one looked at it from, it was a perfect existence. ”

“Bai Mo’s heart was beating faster and faster, and she could hardly breathe. She was very envious of Bai Jingshu. When she thought about how Bai Jingshu would be able to share a bed with Lin Ze in the future, she was extremely jealous. ”

She wished she could scratch Bai Jingshu’s face.

That Damned B * Tch!

Bai Jingshu walked up to elder Bai and smiled. “Grandfather.”

Lin Ze also greeted her. “Grandfather.”

“Elder Bai held their hands and nodded in satisfaction. “Good, good!” ”

“Bai Mo looked up at Bai Jingshu and Lin Ze. “SIS, brother-in-law.” ”

“”Momo.”Bai Jingshu turned to look at Bai Mo. she subconsciously felt that Bai Mo was a little strange today, so she turned to look at Lin Ze. ”

She suddenly remembered something.

Lin Ze had been Momo’s blind date in the beginning.

“Given Momo’s personality, it would definitely be awkward now. If Lin Ze wasn’t the heir of the Shangguan family, it would have been fine. But now, Lin Ze had gone from an ordinary person with nothing to the heir of the Shangguan family, how could Momo accept this? ”

“Elder bai continued, “Jingshu, Ah Ze, let’s go in first.” ”

“Before the marriage, elder Bai had always called Lin Ze Xiao Lin. Now that the two of them had successfully married, elder Bai’s address had changed from Xiao Lin to ah ze. ”

“Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded.

The few of them walked into the old house.
