“Will you die if you don’t Brag?”Fat Tiger was a little speechless. “There are no girls in this car!”

“Dog Two’s skills were indeed good. It followed Lin ze neither too far nor too close, but Lin Ze didn’t notice anything unusual. ”

“It wasn’t that they wanted to pry into Lin Ze’s privacy, but that they were too curious about what a girl who could catch Lin Ze’s eye looked like. ”

She would definitely look good!

The three of them drove all the way to the rose date with Lin Ze.

“In order to prevent Lin ze from discovering them, fat tiger rented a shared car. ”

“Looking at Lin Ze’s back, dog two complained, “Look at how casual brother Ze is. He doesn’t even know how to change his clothes on a date! You guys are not allowed to learn from him in the future. They are all negative examples!” ”

“”Yes, yes, yes.”Fat Tiger nodded. “Not only do I have to change my clothes, I also have to buy a bunch of flowers to wear. How can I not have a sense of ceremony when I meet girls!” ”

“Li Wen took out a pen and paper and silently wrote down these words. If he were to go on a date with his girlfriend in the future, he had to remember these words. ”

“I think I need to buy another lipstick.”Dog two rubbed its chin.

Li Wen also noted down this sentence and looked up at dog two. “I heard that there are many colors to lipstick. which color would girls like better?”

“Of course it’s Pink!”Fat Tiger answered without thinking. “Pink is so cute!”

“That makes sense.”Dog two nodded.

“Li Wen continued, “Can’t we buy other colors?” ”

“”Of course not.”Fat tiger continued, “It’s definitely not wrong to buy pink. If it’s too red, no girl will like it.” ”

“Why?”Li Wen asked.

“Fat Tiger looked very experienced. He cupped his fists and said, “If it’s too red, it’ll look like you ate a child. If you were a girl, would you like it?” ”

“Li Wen immediately shook his head. He felt that what fat tiger said made sense. He patted fat tiger on the shoulder and said with a smile, “I didn’t see it, brother. Although you’ve never been in a relationship, you’re very experienced!” ”

“Of course!”Fat Tiger raised his head proudly.

“”Let’s go in first. Remember to keep a low profile,”buttface said. ”

“Okay.”Li Wen and fat tiger nodded.

Bai Jingshu’s jumping position was quite good. It was near the window and could be seen almost as soon as they entered. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“When she saw Lin Ze enter, she gently raised her hand. “Here.” ”

“Lin Ze jogged over. “Sorry, I’m late.” ”

“Bai Jingshu looked at her watch and smiled. “No, it’s six o’clock now.” ”

She was early.

“What do you want to eat?”Bai Jingshu handed him the menu.

“Lin Ze did not take the menu. He smiled and said, “You order first.” ”

“”I’ve already ordered,”Bai Jingshu said. ”

Lin Ze took the menu and began to order.

“His taste was relatively bland at first. Later, due to ye Zhuo’s influence, he gradually became more diversified. Now, he preferred Sichuan cuisine and even liked dessert after dinner. ”

“After ordering all the dishes, Lin Ze looked at Bai Jingshu. “Do you want dessert?” ”

Bai Jingshu shook her head and smiled. “I don’t eat sweet things at night. I’ll gain weight.”

Girls who loved to look beautiful valued their bodies more.

Bai Jingshu never hid anything in front of others.

“After saying that, Bai Jingshu continued, “I didn’t expect you guys to like desserts too.” ”

“Under normal circumstances, only girls would like to eat such sweet food. ”

“Lin Ze smiled and said, “My sister likes to eat, so I ate with her later.” ”

“Bai Jingshu said, “Right, right, right. I remember now. The last time we ate together, searing had ordered a lot of desserts.” ”

“As the two of them chatted and laughed, dog two, Li Wen, and fat tiger also arrived at the restaurant. ”

“The three of them looked around for Lin Ze’s figure. At this moment, Fat Tiger locked onto Lin Ze’s figure and immediately nudged dog two and Li Wen with his elbow. “Look, Look! Brother ZE is over there!” ”

“Where?”Li Wen immediately asked.

“”Over there, by the window,”fat tiger said. ”

Li Wen and dog two immediately looked over and indeed saw Lin Ze’s back.

Sitting opposite Lin Ze was a girl in a white Chinese dress.

“Her hair was tied up with a jade hairpin, revealing her fair neck. She gave off a strong vintage beauty. ”

She was gentle and elegant.

“”TSK TSK tsk, brother Ze’s taste is not bad!” ”

“He matches brother Ze very well!”

“”Brother Ze is still the best. If he doesn’t make a sound, he’ll be fine. But if he makes a sound, he’ll shock everyone!” ”

The three of them found a secret seat and began to discuss their future.
