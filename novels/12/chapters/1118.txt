“Chapter 1119: 245: When the banquet started, Zhao Xueyin’s face turned green! 3”

Translator: 549690339

There was no such thing as a natural beauty. Real Beauties were all made up by makeup.

“Even if ye Zhuo had a good foundation, she still needed makeup. ”

“Annie thought for a moment and said, “It seems to be Xiao Li.” ”

Xiao Li?

“Ms. Liu’s disciple?”Zhao Xueyin asked.

“”Yes, it’s her.”Annie nodded. ”

“Hearing this, Zhao Xueyin heaved a sigh of relief. ”

It was Ms. Liu who had put makeup on her.

A master and a disciple.

Who was superior and who was inferior.

A discerning person could tell at a glance.

A good makeup artist could turn an ugly woman into a beautiful woman.

A makeup artist with poor skills could turn a beautiful woman into a scene of a horror movie.

“In addition, Ye Zao had chosen the wrong costume. ”

“Tonight, ye Zao was destined to be her foil. ”

“After a while, Zhao Xueyin continued, “Annie, are you close to Xiao Li?” ”

“To be safe, she had to do something. ”

“Otherwise, she would feel uneasy. ”

“Close! Of course!”Annie nodded. “We often eat together!”

“Zhao Xueyin continued, “Then go and help me do something.” ”

“What is it?”Annie asked.

“Come here.”Zhao Xueyin waved at Annie.

“Annie bent down slightly, and Zhao Xueyin whispered something into Annie’s ear. ”

“After a while, Zhao Xueyin looked up. “Do you understand?” ”

“I understand.”

“Zhao Xueyin continued, “Go and do it.” ”

Annie picked up her phone. “Then I’ll go now.”

“Looking at Annie’s back, Zhao Xueyin’s lips curled up. ”

“Tonight, she would definitely win. ”

On the other side.

“Amy waited outside the door for about ten minutes, but ye Zao still didn’t come out. ”

“She was worried that ye Zao wouldn’t wear it, but she was too embarrassed to ask. “Miss Ye, do you need help?” ”

“”Thank you. No, I’m almost done,”ye Zao’s voice came from inside. ”

“Amy said, “If you need help, just let me know.” ”

“Okay.”

“After knowing that ye Zhuo didn’t need help, Amy continued to play with her phone. ”

“Where’s Miss Ye?”The makeup artist came in from outside.

“”Xiao Li, you’re here!”Amy put away her phone. “Miss Ye is still changing inside.” ”

“The makeup artist nodded. “Which gown did you choose, Miss Ye?” ”

She had to choose the right makeup based on the style of the gown.

“Although she had received money from Zhao Xueyin, she still had to do the superficial work. ”

“Amy said, “The black one.” ”

“”Black?”Obviously, the makeup artist also felt that the black gown was not suitable for ye Zao. “Can she handle it?” ”

The black starry night gown needed pure beauty.

The temperament was suitable.

“It wasn’t that ye Zao wasn’t good-looking. It was just that ye Zao’s current aura and experience hadn’t reached that level yet, so she couldn’t bear it. ”

“Amy shrugged. “I couldn’t help it. I told her that White was suitable for her, but she wouldn’t listen.” ”

“The makeup artist smiled. “Young girls nowadays are all like this. If they think they’re good-looking, they can wear whatever they want. It’s fine if they don’t listen, but we can do whatever we want with whatever money we get! “As long as we can live up to our profession.” ”

“Amy nodded. “Yes, you’re right.” ”

“Ye Zao would be the one making a fool of himself, not her. ”

Creak —

At that moment.

The door of the fitting room was pushed open. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Amy looked up.

When she saw it.

She was stunned.

This... This was ye Zao?

The makeup artist was so shocked that she couldn’t close her mouth. Her eyes were filled with surprise. “My God! This is too good-looking!”

A slender figure was standing there.

“She was wearing a black starry night gown. Under the illumination of the lights, the diamonds in front of the gown reflected a dazzling light. ”

This evening gown had another name.

The Moon was surrounded by the stars.

The bright stars surrounded the moon. Even people who were slightly lacking in beauty and temperament would be eclipsed by this evening gown.

“However, ye Zao perfectly interpreted the words ‘all the stars are supporting the Moon’without any reservations. ”

There was a sense of coldness in the beauty.

The mountain was raised high.

It was beyond the reach of others.

“Xiao Li, the makeup artist, had put makeup on many socialites, daughters, and celebrities. She had seen countless beautiful women with good looks and temperament, but this was the first time she had seen someone wearing this starry evening gown like this. ”

It could no longer be described as simply beautiful.

This kind of beauty made people jealous.

No wonder even Zhao Xueyin was so afraid that she had to put in so much effort into ye Zhuo’s makeup.

Xiao Li narrowed his eyes.
