“An lizi smiled and said, “My mom will be very happy after hearing this. By the way, did you guys just come back from the Cloud Capital Yesterday?””

Ye Zhuo nodded.

“An Lizi did not return to the cloud capital for the New Year this year. Instead, she went back to Xia Xiaoman’s hometown and continued, “How is it? Is it cold in the cloud capital?””

“”It’s not cold,”ye Zhuo continued, “It’s much warmer than the capital city. The temperature is around 16 or 17 degrees.””

“An Lizi nodded. “We were going to return to Yun Jing this year, but my grandmother wasn’t feeling well, so my mother decided to go back to visit my grandmother at the last minute.””

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Yun Jing is still the same. If you want to go back and take a look, you can take advantage of the summer vacation to go back.””

“Then will you go back this summer vacation?”An Lizi asked.

“I’m not too sure either. It depends on the situation.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

An Lizi nodded.

“Ye Zhuo took a bite of dessert and continued, “Oh right, how’s the matter between Auntie and my uncle?””

“An Lizi shook her head. “I’m not too sure either, but I can feel that your grandmother’s situation isn’t going well.””

“After saying that, an lizi continued, “Although Uncle Lin has been coming to our house quite frequently these past few days, I can see from his eyes that he’s under a lot of pressure.””

“Ye Zhuo narrowed his eyes. “My grandmother is indeed very difficult to deal with, but don’t worry too much about you and Auntie. I believe that my fourth uncle will definitely not compromise with my grandmother this time.””

An Lizi nodded.

“After leaving the cafe, the two of them went to watch a movie. Then, they went to the nearby shopping mall and bought a lot of clothes. It was not until evening that the two of them returned to their respective homes.”

...

“At the same time, at the Lin residence.”

“Lin Qingxuan’s body reeked of alcohol as she looked for Old Madam Lin. “Mom, can you really not help Xiao Man and me?””

“”No.”Old Madam Lin’s face was stern. “Qingxuan, I’m doing this for your own good! I hope that you can understand me! I’m already so old, do you have the heart to make me work hard for you every day?””

“At her age, she was supposed to be enjoying her retirement, but now she was worried about Lin Qingxuan every day.”

Which child would be as insensible as Lin Qingxuan?

“The More Old Lady Lin thought about it, the angrier she got. “Is that Xia Xiaoman that good? Better Than Me, your biological mother? You’re already in your forties this year, not four years old. Can’t you feel sorry for Your Mother?””

“At this point, Old Lady Lin couldn’t control herself and started coughing violently.”

“The poison in her body hadn’t been completely removed yet, but Lin Qingxuan acted as if he couldn’t see it. Whenever he opened his mouth and shut it, it was Xia Xiaoman. Every time she thought of this, Old Lady Lin’s heart would turn cold and she would feel very uncomfortable.”

“”Mother,”Lin Qingxuan looked at Old Lady Lin like this. “Xiaoman is really a good woman...””

“”Get lost! Get lost!”Old Lady Lin pointed at the door and said, “I don’t want to hear Xia Xiaoman’s name again! Are you trying to anger me to death? So that you can marry that woman?””

“Lin Qingxuan looked up at Old Lady Lin and wanted to say something, but in the end, she didn’t say anything. She turned around and walked out of the door.”

Old Lady Lin looked at Lin Qingxuan’s back and sighed deeply.

“Without realizing it, Lin Qingxuan walked to the east courtyard.”

The east courtyard housed Lin Jincheng’s family of four.

“Compared to the quiet west courtyard, the east courtyard was very lively. Standing in the courtyard, one could hear the voices coming from inside.”

“At this time, the family of four was having dinner.”

“Lin Qingxuan did not want to go over and disturb them, but he could not hold it in anymore. He walked over and knocked on the door.”

“The person who opened the door was ye Zhuo. Seeing Lin Qingxuan like this, Ye Zhuo said in surprise, “Fourth uncle? Are You Okay?””

“I’m fine.”Lin Qingxuan waved his hand.

“”Fourth brother is here?”Lin Jincheng walked out of the house and was shocked to see Lin Qingxuan like this. He quickly walked over and held Lin Qingxuan. “Fourth brother, why are you like this?””

“Lin Qingxuan immediately hugged Lin Jincheng and said in distress, “Jincheng! What should I do? What should I do?”Old Lady Lin was driving him crazy!”

Lin Qingxuan just wanted to find someone to talk to.

“Lin Jincheng helped Lin Qingxuan into the house. “Fourth brother, what happened?””

“Seeing Lin Jincheng helping Lin Qingxuan into the house, ye Shu said, “I’ll get some water to wash fourth brother’s face.””

Lin Jincheng nodded.

Ye Shu went to fetch water.

“Lin Qingxuan held Lin Jincheng’s hand, “Jincheng, didn’t you know how much I Envy You? Look at how happy your family of four is! I finally found someone I like, but mom still tried every means to stop us from being together...””
