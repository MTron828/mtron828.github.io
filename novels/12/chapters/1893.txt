“Chinese people were greedy by nature. Logically speaking, Li Sanzhu and Fang Yueyin would not miss out on this good marriage. ”

On the other side.

“Not long after ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing returned from enjoying the snowy scenery, Li Yueyue came to ye Zhuo’s room and knocked on the door. ”

“”Da Zhuozhuo, are you there?” ”

“Ye Zhuo put down the mouse in his hand and raised his eyes slightly. “I’m inside. Yueyue, come in.” ”

“Li Yueyue pushed the door open and entered. She placed the fruit plate in her hand beside ye Zao. “Da Zao Zao, did you go out to play with master five today?” ”

Ye Zao nodded slightly. “We went out for a walk.”

“When are you guys going back?”Li Yueyue continued to ask.

“”On the 25th of December,”ye Zao answered. ”

“On the 25th of December?”Li Yueyue asked.

“Yes.”

“Li Yueyue continued, “Why don’t you guys go back later. “The 28th of December is the new year on our grassland. There will be a lot of activities on that day. It’s rare for you guys to come to the grassland. You guys can go back after the 29th of December. “On the 27th of December, we can go shopping at the bazaar. At that time, many vagrants will come here to set up stalls.” ”

“It sounded quite interesting, but ye Zhuo had already discussed with CEN Shaoqing about going back on the 25th. “How about this? I’ll discuss it with Cen Shaoqing later.” ”

“”Okay.”Li yueyue nodded and continued, “By the way, this is a Garbo fruit. I heard from my mom that it’s very rare. Try It.” ”

“The Garbo fruit was the same size as a grape, and its color was the same as a grape. It was purplish-red and looked somewhat tempting. ”

“Ye Zhuo picked up a cabernet fruit and gently chewed it open. The juice flowed in all directions, making it sweet and delicious. ”

“How does it taste?”Li Yueyue asked.

“It’s Delicious.”Ye Zhuo nodded.

“Li Yueyue smiled and said, “I knew you would like it. That’s all for now. I Won’t disturb you while you’re working.” ”

“It’s okay. I’m not busy now.”Ye Zhuo smiled. “Let’s sit down and talk.”

“Okay.”Li Yueyue nodded and chatted with ye Zao.

“Half an hour later, ye Zao sent Li Yueyue out. ”

“Li Yueyue came downstairs. Fang yinyue was watching TV. When she saw her coming down, she immediately stood up and said, “Yueyue.” ”

“What’s Wrong?”Li Yueyue asked.

“Fang yinyue continued, “Do you like Jia Bao Guo, Miss Ye?” ”

“Jia Bao Guo was not a fruit of this season. In order to get some fresh Jia Bao Guo, Fang yinyue had also put in some effort. ”

“I like to eat it very much.”Li Yueyue nodded.

“Hearing that, Fang yinyue smiled and said, “That’s great. There are still some in the preservation cabinet. Remember to send them up later.” ”

“There’s more?”Li Yueyue looked at Fang yinyue with a face full of question marks. “Didn’t you say that there were no more?”

“Just now, she had only eaten two more, but Fang yinyue didn’t let her eat any more. She said that the food was precious, so she bought a few. Because Jia Bao fruit wasn’t easy to grow, the yield was low, and now it was out of season, so the price was very expensive, they were all sold according to the number of grains. ”

“The price of just one grain was raised to a three-digit price. Those with good quality were even raised to a four-digit price, and this didn’t include the transportation costs. ”

“Fang yinyue said, “I’m just afraid that if miss ye likes to eat, our family won’t have any more.” ”

“The children on the prairie were very hospitable. Even if they did not eat, they had to leave it for the guests to eat. ”

“Moreover, Ye Zhuo’s status was noble, so she could not be wronged when it came to eating. ” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“After saying this, Fang yinyue said again, “Did you send it to Lord Fifth?” ”

“Li Yueyue said, “Lord Fifth is a man after all. It’s not suitable for a girl like me to go. I’ll get the housekeeper to send it.” ”

“That’s fine.”It didn’t matter who sent him off. What was important was that he couldn’t neglect the honored guest.

“After Li Yueyue left, Ye Zhuo turned on his computer and busied himself for about an hour. Then, he came to the door of Cen Shaoqing’s room. ”

He knocked on the door with his fingers.

“A moment later, a deep and magnetic voice came from inside. “Come in.” ”

Ye Zhuo pushed the door open and entered.

“As soon as he entered, he saw Cen Shaoqing holding a Buddhist bead in one hand and a cell phone in the other. He stood in front of the French window and looked out at the vast expanse of whiteness as if he was talking to someone. There was a sense of oppression in the air. ”

“Adults should pay the price for what they have done. No one can say anything about this. Be careful on the road.”

“Ye Zao walked to the side and sat down. When he saw that Cen Shaoqing’s table had a plate of Jia Bao fruits, he picked one up and tasted it. ”

“About a minute later, Cen Shaoqing hung up the phone and walked to ye Zao’s side. He lowered his voice and asked, “What instructions do you have, leader?” ”

“His voice had always been pleasant to listen to and was full of magnetism. At this moment, his deliberately lowered voice was even more pleasant to the ear. ”
