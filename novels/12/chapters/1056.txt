“Okay.”An Lizi nodded and followed ye Zao into the car.

“After returning to the Lin family manor, Ye Zao went into the study room and broke Zhao Pingting’s phone into several pieces. Finally, he heard that the host computer was connected to the computer. ”

“An Lizi was dumbfounded. Before she could react, Zhao Pingting’s phone desktop was already displayed on ye Zao’s computer screen. ”

“Soon, Ye Zhuo found out that Zhao Pingting had used the car-sharing app at around 9 pm last night. Although the order information had been deleted, it was just a small problem for ye Zhuo. In less than ten minutes.., ye Zhuo recovered the order information. ”

The car’s owner was Sun Dongdong. He was 48 years old and had been an online car-hailing driver for five years.

He was still taking orders normally.

“Ye Zao checked Sun Dongdong’s order information on the heavenly eye. At 9:30 last night, when an Lizi got on the car, Sun Dongdong did not take orders. Instead, he was resting. Moreover, there were surveillance cameras that captured Sun Dongdong’s figure. ”

“In other words, the real online ride-hailing driver was not Sun Dongdong. Instead, someone had impersonated Sun Dongdong and intercepted his order. ”

It seemed that this person was also an internet expert.

“After further investigation, ye Zao discovered that this suspect used hacking technology to specifically target female university students. Ye Zao narrowed his eyes, picked up his phone and stood up. “Lizi, stay at home. I’m going out for a while.” ”

“”Zao Zao, are you going to look for Pingting? I’ll go with you!” ”

“Ye zhuozhuo continued, “I’ll go alone. Pay attention to your phone and keep in touch with me.” ”

“Can you do it alone?”

“”Are you still worried about my skills?”Ye Zhuozhuo picked up the car keys and continued, “Oh right, don’t tell my parents about this for now.” ”

“”Okay.”An Lizi nodded. “Then Zhuozhuo, you must be careful!” ”

“Don’t worry.”

“Ye Zao drove to the suburbs. After parking the car, he picked up his phone and placed an order for an online car-hailing service at NAN University. ”

“After placing the order, ye Zao immediately turned on the computer and began to operate it. ”

“She leaned against the car door, holding the computer in one hand and jumping on the keyboard with the other hand. The only sound in the air was the crackling of the keyboard. ”

In the damp basement.

The Bald Man was taking off his shirt and walking towards Zhao Pingting.

“Zhao Pingting looked at the bald man, her eyes full of fear. ”

Beep —

“At this moment, a clear ringing sound rang in the air. ”

“The bald man immediately stopped and took out his phone from his pocket. When he saw the order message on the phone, a wretched smile appeared on the corner of the Bald Man’s mouth. Then, he picked up the clothes that he had thrown on the ground and put on a khaki cap, he also put on a pair of black-rimmed glasses. He looked honest and honest. Who would have thought that he was a wolf in sheep’s clothing? ”

Bang!

The bald man slammed the iron door of the basement.

Whoosh!

“After the bald man left, the short-haired woman who was locked next to Zhao Pingting heaved a sigh of relief. ”

He left.

He finally left!

“Are you also a university student?”The short-haired woman looked at Zhao Pingting.

“Zhao Pingting was stunned for a moment, then she turned to look at the short-haired girl and nodded. ”

“The short-haired girl continued, “You don’t have to be nervous. That pervert will not return for a short period of time.” ”

“Hearing this, Zhao Pingting also heaved a sigh of relief. ”

“For the entire day and night, the bald man had been guarding the basement. Faced with such a demon, Zhao Pingting’s mental state was always in a state of high tension. ”

“The short-haired girl continued, “I’ve been locked up here for a week. Every time his phone rang with that sound, he would go out and bring back new prey. This time, I don’t know who’s so unlucky...”. “...”. At the end of her sentence.., the short-haired girl gave a wry smile. “I’m really sick! I’m already like this, and I still have time to worry about others!” ”

“Zhao Pingting looked at the short-haired girl and continued, “You’ve been locked up here for so long, and your family didn’t even notice that you went missing?” ”

“”I’m an orphan,”the short-haired girl laughed self-deprecatingly. “So what if I have family? Look at those two, they both have family, but they’re still locked up here!” ”

“Zhao pingting continued, “Haven’t you ever thought about escaping?” ”

“Escape? How?”The short-haired girl glanced at Zhao Pingting.

“Zhao pingting lowered her head to look at the chains around her neck, then at the iron cage that trapped her. The light in her eyes slowly faded. ” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

They couldn’t escape.

Could it be that they could only wait for death?

At the same time.

“The bald man came to the address of the ‘prey’. From Afar, he saw a slender figure standing under the camphor tree. Seeing a car approaching, the girl immediately walked over. “Are You Master Zhao?” ”

The bald man was stunned.

“After hunting for so long, this was the first time he had seen such a peerless beauty. A faint light flashed in his eyes as he nodded and said, “You’re going to South University, right?” ”

“Yes.”The girl nodded.

“The bald man continued, “Quickly get in the car!” ”

The girl opened the car door and got in.

“After driving for a while, the Bald Man took out a cup of hot milk tea as usual and handed it to the backseat. “Little girl, the weather has been cold recently. Drink a cup of milk tea to warm your body.” ”

“Thank you.”The little girl took the cup of milk tea and took a sip.

“Seeing this scene through the rearview mirror, the bald man subconsciously swallowed his throat. ”

“After hunting for so long, he had also made mistakes. Some university students were especially smart and did not drink drinks of unknown origin. In such a situation, he could only follow the order and send the prey to the place where the order was placed. ”

“He thought that this little girl would reject milk tea of unknown origin, but she actually drank it. ”

How Stupid!

An hour later.

“The sound of the door opening came from the quiet basement, followed by heavy footsteps. ”

The short-haired girl looked up and saw the bald man walking in with a small cart.

There was a large cardboard box on the small cart. The cardboard box was upside down on the cart. Only the short-haired girl knew that the cardboard box contained the bald man’s prey.

The short-haired girl glanced at Zhao Pingting. Zhao Pingting turned her head and saw the bald man opening the cardboard box that was upside down on the trolley.

“After the cardboard box was opened, a slender figure could be seen sitting inside. ”

“It was also at this moment that the girl, whose eyes were tightly shut, suddenly opened her eyes. ”

“In an instant, a cold light flashed. ”

“Zhao Pingting was stunned for a moment before she quickly reacted. With a trembling voice, she said, “Sear Sear!” ”

She had never expected that ye Zao would also be deceived by the Bald Man!

What should she do!

What should she do now?

“It was one thing for her to be caught, but now she had actually implicated ye Zao.. ”
