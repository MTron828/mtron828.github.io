Father Zhao nodded.

“Sitting on the hospital bed, Zhao Pingting looked at her parents’departing back and felt so sad that she wanted to cry. ”

But she couldn’t cry.

She had to act happy.

If she felt so sad.

Then her parents and family would definitely feel a thousand times worse than her.

Zhao Pingting’s parents walked out of the door.

“Only then did mother Zhao ask, “Old Zhao, tell me the truth about our Pingting’s situation.”Father Zhao had said it too easily just now, and she felt that something was not right. ”

“Father Zhao shook his head. After a long while, he sobbed, “The Doctor said that our Pingting... Pingting only has three months left at most.” ”

“What?”Mother Zhao’s face instantly turned pale. She covered her mouth and sobbed.

Three months.

Only three months left...

“Father Zhao’s eyes also turned red. “Alright, stop crying. If the child sees this, she will definitely feel bad. There are so many miracles in this world. What if Pingting recovers from the radiation treatment?” ”

Mother Zhao cried so much that she could not help herself. She leaned her back against the wall and slowly slid to the ground.

“Right now, she only hated why she was not the one who was sick. ”

Why?

“Old Zhao!”Mother Zhao hugged Father Zhao.

Father Zhao also felt very uncomfortable.

He did not know how to comfort his wife.

The couple hugged each other and cried for a long time.

This scene did not attract anyone’s attention.

Where was this place?

It was the hospital.

The most common separation in the hospital was between life and death.

The illness was merciless.

“After seeing it many times, one would become numb to it. ”

After a long while.

The Zhao family’s parents gradually calmed down.

“Mother Zhao endured the pain and said, “Since it has already come to this point, we can not let the child leave with regrets. We have to explain that incident back then to the child clearly.” ”

“”Okay.”Father Zhao sighed and nodded. “When Yingjun and the others come, we can discuss it together.” ”

This was not a small matter.

“Okay.”

In the evening.

Zhao Yingjun and Tang Jia came over with food.

Zhao Pingting’s parents took advantage of Zhao Pingting’s sleep to call the couple out.

“”Dad, Mom, do you have something to tell us?” ”

“Zhao Pingting’s father nodded. “It’s about Pingting. You know about Pingting’s condition. The Doctor said that we have to prepare for the worst. Your mom and I have discussed it. No matter what, we can’t let Pingting have any regrets.” ”

“Tang Jia could hear the hidden meaning in his words. She frowned slightly. “Dad, do you mean to tell Pingting about her true identity?” ”

“Actually, Zhao Pingting was not born by her parents. ”

She was abandoned by her biological parents the moment she was born.

“Coincidentally, the Zhao couple had always wanted a daughter, so they adopted Zhao Pingting. ”

“All these years, they treated her like their own daughter. ”

“Okay.”Father Zhao nodded.

“Father Zhao continued, “I plan to invite Pingting’s biological parents over to visit her. Let’s sit down and explain this matter clearly.” ”

He couldn’t let the child come to the human world without even knowing who he was.

“Zhao Yingjun asked worriedly, “But will they come?” ”

“Mother Zhao sighed. “The human heart is made of flesh and blood. The child is already like this. As a parent, they will definitely come.” ”

“Little sister? !”

“At this moment, Tang Jia cried out in surprise. ”

No one had expected Zhao Pingting to suddenly appear here.

Zhao Pingting’s emotions were not as broken as she had imagined.

On the contrary.

She was very calm.

“She was so calm that she did not even frown. Instead, a smile appeared on her face, “Dad, Mom, I heard everything. Don’t go and look for them. Since they had already abandoned me back then, they have nothing to do with me. Only the two of you are my biological parents.” ”

“Actually, when she was very young, Zhao Pingting had heard some rumors. ”

“At that time, she didn’t think much of it. ”

She didn’t expect it to be true.

“She had only experienced one big disaster in her life, so this small incident was nothing. ”

“Pingting!”Mother Zhao ran over and hugged Zhao Pingting.

“”Mom, I’m fine. Don’t cry.”Zhao pingting patted mother Zhao’s back. ”

“Zhao pingting continued, “Are they uncle Wang and Aunt Lan?” ”

Zhao pingting nodded.

“No Wonder.”Zhao Pingting smiled.

No wonder she had to throw her away.

The uncle Wang and Aunt Lan that Zhao Pingting mentioned used to live in the same neighborhood as them.

“Later, for some unknown reason, they suddenly moved away. ”

Uncle Wang’s full name was Wang Dancai.

Aunt Lan’s name is Lan Yue Yin.

The couple valued sons over daughters.
