Chapter 1085: 239: My Blood is boiling and my face is swollen! 5

Translator: 549690339

It was already 8:30 pm.

The night view of the capital was beautiful. The neon lights were flashing and snow was falling from the sky.

Zhao Xueyin drove her car to a restaurant and stopped it.

The restaurant’s business was booming.

“Even though it was snowing, it was still crowded. Not only that, there was a long line at the entrance. ”

Zhao Xueyin parked her car and came over to line up.

“At this moment, she suddenly saw a familiar figure. ”

“The girl’s figure was graceful. Under the falling snow, she was only wearing a black dress. The cold wind blew, blowing up the waterfall-like black hair at her waist, revealing her slender figure in the snow. ”

“The dress was slim, making her slender waist look even more slender. ”

It couldn’t withstand a single fold.

“She had her back to Zhao Xueyin, so Zhao Xueyin couldn’t see her face. ”

“Even so, Zhao Xueyin recognized her at a glance. ”

It was ye Zhuo.

“At this moment, another figure appeared in Zhao Xueyin’s sight. ”

“The man had a slender figure. He held a string of bright red Buddhist beads in his left hand and wore a moon-white vintage long gown with a pair of buttons. He wore a long black coat over it, and his body emitted a domineering aura. ”

No one dared to look directly at him.

“After a moment, the man turned around slightly, took off his coat, and draped it over the girl beside him. ”

Only then did Zhao Xueyin see the man’s well-defined facial features clearly.

She was slightly startled.

“His pair of mysterious eyes were deep and bottomless. His skin was very white, as if he had not seen the sun for a long time. It was actually whiter than the snowflakes floating in the air. There was a red mole at the end of his eye, which carried a hint of sickness, the other seven points were cold and arrogant. ”

Zhao Xueyin was born noble. She had seen all kinds of men since she was young?

But this was the first time she had seen a man like this.

“After a long time, Zhao Xueyin finally reacted. She did not wait in line anymore. She immediately went back to the car and made a call. ”

“Check Ye Zao’s boyfriend for me.”

“After making the call, Zhao Xueyin sat in the driver’s seat and waited. ”

“About ten minutes later, Zhao Xueyin received an email. ”

Cen Shaoqing.

Male.

People called him CEN fifth master. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

The founder of the CEN Group.

“Cen Shaoqing was in a high position, so the information he found was more official. ”

Zhao Xueyin curved her lips slightly.

Who Did she think it was.

It was Cen Shaoqing.

“Although the prominent families in the capital all called Cen Shaoqing CEN fifth master, Cen Shaoqing was nothing in the financial world. ”

The Cen family was nothing in the financial world.

Although they were all called “Fifth Master”.

“But compared to the founder of HK consortium, CEN Shaoqing was not just a little bit inferior. ”

“At this moment, Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes. ”

Sitara YC and Niu Hulu YC were the same person. What if CEN Shaoqing was the fifth Master of HK?

Then what would she do?

“Ever since she became an adult, the fifth master had been Zhao Xueyin’s goal in life. ”

“Thinking of this, Zhao Xueyin turned on her computer and sent a message. ”

Not long after.

The other side replied.

The founder of HK consortium was surnamed Bai.

It had nothing to do with Cen Shaoqing.

“Seeing this, Zhao Xueyin heaved a sigh of relief. ”

It was good that there was no relationship.

She was really afraid that Cen Shaoqing was the fifth Master of HK Consortium.

“In a moment, Zhao Xueyin started the car and rushed back. ”

“When the car passed by Ye Zao, she happened to see ye Zao and Cen Shaoqing kissing under the snow. ”

“Under the falling snow, the two of them stood under the dim yellow streetlights. ”

The girl stood on her tiptoes slightly and hooked her arm around the man’s neck.

The scene was so romantic that it was like filming an idol drama.

Zhao Xueyin’s eyes were filled with ridicule.

One look at this scene and one could tell that it was ye Zhuo trying to get close to Cen Shaoqing.

How many girls would be so unreserved that they would take the initiative to ask for a Kiss?

It seemed that Si lui was right.

A person like ye Zhuo would definitely not end up better than ye Langhua!

“A moment later, Ye Zhuo let go of Cen Shaoqing and said with a slight frown, “You put your phone in your pocket again?” ”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing looked at the man’s Crimson Lips and held back the lust in his heart. His left hand held the Buddha Pearl and remained calm.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Did you put your phone horizontally?” ”

Cen Shaoqing was stunned for a moment.

“Ye Zhuo glanced at him. “If it wasn’t horizontally placed, why would it be protruding?” ”

Cen Shaoqing’s eyebrows jumped and he reached out to grab ye Zhuo’s hand. “Lead us there? I heard that the sweet water shop there is very delicious! Ziteng has already recommended it to me many times!”

“Really?”Ye Zao’s attention was instantly drawn away.

“Of course it’s true.”
