In Cen Yuyan’s opinion.

Only song Chenyu was a true racing expert.

“Not only was song Chenyu Beautiful, her acting skills were good, and she had a kind heart. She was also very good at racing. She was publicly acknowledged as a person of strength. ”

“In the entire entertainment industry, other than song Chenyu, there was no other female star who dared to enter the racing track ”

“In last year’s car race, song Chenyu’s results even surpassed that dark horse, he ziteng, and she directly ascended to the throne of first place! ”

It made countless fans go crazy!

Ye Zhuo wanted to be compared to Song Chenyu?

It was simply a pipe dream!

“Song Chenyu stood up and said gently, “Yuyan, I’m just a dabbler. My racing skills definitely can’t compare to miss ye. Don’t make fun of me.” ”

Song Chenyu had an easy-going personality. He never took the initiative to stir up trouble and was very popular in the entertainment industry.

“”Chenyu, you’re being too modest.”CEN Yuyan continued, “It’s said that every move of an expert is fatal. Since you two racing experts met on the race track today, of course, you have to let us have a feast of your eyes!” ”

“Hearing this, the others at the side all had expectant gazes. ”

“Currently, in the car racing world of the capital, other than song Chenyu, there weren’t many female car racers. ”

“In addition, he ziteng also called Ye Zhuo a god, so everyone was even more expectant. ”

“An expert meeting an expert, who was the expert? ”

“He ziteng said, “Sister Yuyan is right, an expert is fatal in every move! Miss song, just compete with a god.”After saying this, he ziteng looked at ye Zhuo again. “God, God, do you want to compete?” ” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “I can do either.” ”

The traffic jam in the capital was very serious. She had not exercised her muscles and bones for a long time.

“”Miss Song, it’s up to you now.”He ziteng turned his head to look at Song Chenyu. ”

Song Chenyu hesitated for a moment.

“Cen Yuyan Shook Song Chenyu’s arm. “Agree! Agree! Chenyu, just agree!” ”

“O-okay then.”Song Chenyu raised his head to look at Ye Zhuo. “I’m not good at driving. I hope Miss Ye can give me some pointers!”

“He was already number one, yet he was not good at driving? ”

Everyone sighed endlessly.

They all sighed in their hearts that song Chenyu was really too low-key and too modest!

He was indeed worthy of being a dazzling star in the entertainment industry.

Ye Zhuo raised his eyes slightly. “It’s easy to say.”

Easy to say?

“Ye Zao, who had never received any honors in the racing industry, actually dared to say such words in front of Song Chenyu. ”

Wasn’t this a little overestimating himself?

Cen Yuyan’s face was filled with disdain.

She did not understand where ye Zao’s confidence came from.

“Thinking of the scene where Ye Zao was taught a lesson by song Chenyu, a smile appeared on Cen Yuyan’s face. ”

Cen Shaoqing would then be able to see song Chenyu’s strengths clearly.

What was Ye Zhuo?

“Other than that face, she could not compare to song Chenyu at all. ”

“He ziteng smiled and said, “That’s settled then. Guru, you can drive my car later.” ”

Those who liked racing cars all had their own cars in the race track.

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“No need. She’ll drive my car.”Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads and turned his head to look at the young man beside him. “Get Someone to drive knight number five over.”

Knight No. 5?

That was Cen Shaoqing’s exclusive racing car!

“Cen Shaoqing loved racing cars, and he loved cars like crazy. ”

“From Knight No. 5 to Knight No. 10, there were a total of 10 racing cars. ”

“Among them, Knight No. 5 had the highest configuration. It was the only one in the world, and it was Cen Shaoqing’s favorite car. Usually, he would not let anyone touch it. ”

He did not expect that Cen Shaoqing would use Knight No. 5 today for Ye Zao.

The young man was stunned.

He thought he was hearing things.

“”Master No. 5, are you talking about Knight No. 5?”The Young Man asked uncertainly. ”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Hearing this, the young man suppressed the shock in his heart and said, “Okay, I’ll make the arrangements right away.” ”

“Not to mention the young man, even he ziteng was stunned. ”

Everyone present knew that Cen Shaoqing cherished knight No. 5 very much?

“Because Cen Shaoqing’s personal domain awareness was particularly strong, no one could use his things recklessly. That was why he ziteng suggested letting ye Zhuo use his car. ”

He did not expect ye Zhuo to be an exception to Cen Shaoqing.

“Cen Yuyan frowned slightly and whispered into song Chenyu’s ear, “I think Shaoqing is really obsessed! He actually wants to let Knight No. 5 open for Ye Zhuo. Isn’t this a waste of God’s Gift?” ”

Cen Yuyan was still a little indignant.

“Previously, she wanted to borrow knight No. 5 to open for Song Chenyu, but Cen Shaoqing refused without thinking. She did not expect Cen Shaoqing to give Knight No. 5 to Ye Burning in the blink of an eye today! ”
