Doctor Wang had long expected this to happen.

“Once he objected to Ye Zhuo’s diagnosis, director Han would definitely take action to suppress him. At that time, he could only leave the hospital. ” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Even if ye Zhuo’s surgery failed, it would not be exposed. After all, there was no surgery in this world that was absolutely safe. ”

“Therefore, doctor Wang came to strike first, making it difficult for director Han to back down. ”

“At a time like this, director Han still dared to let him leave the hospital? ”

“Ye Zao was a very well-known person. As long as he released a little bit of news, countless media outlets would flock to him. When that time came, he would surpass ye Zao, naturally, he would become someone who could stand shoulder to shoulder with ye Zao. ”

“You contacted the media?”Director Han looked at Doctor Wang. It was obvious that he was angry.

“”Yes.”Doctor Wang did not deny it. Instead, he nodded directly. ”

“”Wang Dajun, do you know the consequences of your actions? !” ”

“”Director Han, I have already said what I should have said.”If he said too much, it would be nonsense. This time, he was determined to make everyone recognize him again. ”

Director Han frowned tightly.

“He had known Wang Dajun for many years. In his eyes, Wang Dajun had always been an honest and dutiful person. This time, Wang Dajun’s actions really surprised director Han! ”

“”Director,”the medical assistant said again, “The reporters are still waiting for you outside.” ”

Director Han was not in the mood to deal with those reporters. “Just say that I’m very busy right now!”

The medical assistant glanced at director Han and nodded.

“After saying that, director Han glanced at Doctor Wang and turned around to walk out. ”

Doctor Wang also walked out.

Director Han came to Ye Zao’s office.

“”Miss Ye, I’m really sorry.”Director Han looked at Ye Zao who was sitting in front of his desk, and his face was full of shame. “It’s all my fault for leading poorly on doctor Wang’s matter!”Director Han really did not have the face to see ye Zao right now, he had originally wanted to invite ye Zhuo to study rare cases, but he didn’t expect such a thing to happen. ”

“He didn’t know what Wang Dajun was thinking, to actually do such a thing! ”

“Ye Zhuo didn’t directly answer director Han’s words. He stood up from his chair and said, “Let’s go and see Weiwei.” ”

“Okay.”Director Han nodded and followed ye Zhuo’s footsteps.

“Not long after, the two of them arrived at Weiwei’s ward. ”

“Weiwei was lying on the hospital bed. When she heard a knock on the door, she said with a pale face, “Come in.” ”

Ye Zhuo pushed the door open and entered.

“Seeing ye Zhuo, Weiwei was still very happy. “Sister Ye.” ”

“After saying that, she greeted director Han. “Uncle Director.” ”

“Director Han looked at Weiwei. “Weiwei, are you feeling better?” ”

“Yes.”Weiwei nodded.

“Ye Zao first stretched out his hand to touch Weiwei’s forehead, and then said, “Weiwei, I have a general understanding of the situation. Do you think I’m lying to you, so you refused the surgery tomorrow?” ”

“Weiwei looked at ye Zao and widened her eyes in surprise, as if she was asking how ye Zao knew! ”

“Ye Zao smiled faintly. “There’s nothing I don’t know, only things I don’t want to investigate. Similarly, it’s the same for illnesses. There are no patients that I can’t cure, only patients that don’t cooperate.” ”

Wei Wei lowered her head and didn’t say anything. The future was too beautiful. She didn’t dare to imagine it. The feeling of hope suddenly disappearing when she saw it was too unbearable. She really didn’t want to experience it a second time.

“After saying that.., ye Zhuo continued, “Vivi, as long as you cooperate well, I promise you that I will give you a healthy body again. In the future, you can freely browse the great rivers and mountains of this country. With your hands, you will allow your readers and yourself a bright future.”Vivi was a particularly talented soul painter, the works she created had healed many people. ”

“Recalling what doctor Wang had told her, the hope that had finally been ignited in Vivi’s eyes was instantly extinguished. ”

“”Sister Ye, I know you’re a good person and a good doctor, but I know my own body very well.”Vivi continued, “Thank you, thank you for comforting me.” ”

“”What exactly did Wang Dajun say to you!”Director Han looked at Vivi like this and could not control his emotions, then, he said, “Little girl, don’t worry. Your illness isn’t as serious as Wang Dajun said. You’re just malaria. Although it’s different from ordinary malaria, Miss Ye has already found a treatment plan. After the surgery tomorrow, you’ll be able to do whatever you want like a normal person!” ”
