Translator: 549690339

“He wanted her to change her nationality and take part in the shooting competition in the name of Korea, bringing glory to Korea.”

This was absolutely impossible!

“Jin Yuyan smiled and said, “Miss Ye, don’t make it sound so absolute. I came here to call you a friend. Miss Ye, aren’t you going to invite me to sit?””

“Please do as you wish.”

Jin Yuyan sat beside Bai Xiaosu.

“Jin Yuyan was the eldest Princess of Korea, and her aura was not to be underestimated. As soon as she sat down, Bai Xiaosu felt a strong pressure that made him unable to breathe.”

Bai Xiaosu gulped.

“He then looked at Ye Zhuo, who was still as calm as ever, as if nothing had happened. Not only was she not inferior in the slightest, but in terms of aura, she was even better.”

“Jin Yuyan smiled at Bai Xiaosu, “This is Miss Bai, right?””

“I am.”Bai Xiaosu nodded.

“Jin Yuyan continued, “I heard that there are entertainment programs that you young people like on the second floor of this restaurant. Coincidentally, I booked this place and it’s all empty now. Miss Bai, aren’t you going to experience it?””

“Just as Bai Xiaosu was about to refuse, the restaurant owner walked over, “Miss Bai, come with me.””

“Bai Xiaosu had no choice but to stand up and say to ye Zao, “Miss Ye, I’ll be going now.””

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Bai Xiaosu followed the restaurant owner’s footsteps. After thinking for a moment, he turned back to look at ye Zao. “Miss Ye, if there’s anything you need, please give me a call.””

“Okay.”

“After Bai Xiaosu left, Jin Yuyan looked up at Ye Zao. “Miss Ye, are you really not considering becoming a national of Korea?””

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “I was born and raised in China. Now is the time to serve my motherland. If I change my nationality at this time and participate in the design competition under the name of a contestant from Korea, my eating style will be too ugly.””

“Jin Yuyan did not say anything more. Instead, she pushed a blank check in front of ye Zao. “Miss Ye, you can fill in the amount.””

“After saying that, Jin Yuyan smiled and said, “Other than these, I will also give you and your family the highest-ranking surname and the most prominent status in Korea!””

“In this world, what was the most realistic thing?”

Money and power.

“Until now, she had never met someone who could resist a blank check.”

“After saying that, Jin Yuyan looked at Ye Zao.”

She felt like she was looking down on him.

She enjoyed the process of conquering him.

“No matter how patriotic and hot-blooded ye Zao was, he would eventually betray China and become a new Korean.”

The reason why ye Zao didn’t agree to her was to raise his status and get more benefits.

“Now, not only did she let ye Zao fill in the amount on the check, but she also gave his family the nationality and high-class surname of Korea. At this moment, ye Zao must be very happy.” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

She just didn’t show it.

“She didn’t expect that ye Zao didn’t look old, but he had a lot of patience.”

“If it were anyone else, they would have started cheering on the spot!”

But Ye Zao didn’t.

“Not only did she not, her performance was still as light as a chrysanthemum.”

“Even if she was pretending, it was still very impressive!”

“After all, her age was obvious.”

“The next second, Ye Zao picked up the check.”

“Seeing her pick up the check, Jin Yuyan’s lips curled up.”

As expected.

“Next, it was time for ye Zhuo to sign.”

“That was why the Chinese were hypocritical. They had wanted to sign the check since the beginning, yet they still pretended to be very patriotic.”

People like them would never appear in Korea!

“Jin Yuyan picked up the cup, drank a mouthful of lemonade, and quietly waited for Ye Zhuo to sign the check.”

She was even waiting for ye Zao to bow down to her.

“”When the eldest princess sent people to investigate me, they didn’t find out my worth?”Ye Zao put the check back on the table, then he said, “The dress you’re wearing, the jewelry you’re wearing, and the perfume you’re wearing are all my properties.””

“After he said that, ye Zao stood up from his chair. “I’m sorry, I have something to do. Please excuse me.””

“Before Jin Yuyan could react, ye Zhuo had already walked to the staircase.”

“After a long while, Jin Yuyan looked at her assistant and tried her best to control her emotions. “What did she say just now?””

“As a princess, Jin Yuyan was always sought after no matter where she went. Many people wanted to please her.”

Some people didn’t even have the chance to please her.

But Ye Zao!

Ye Zao actually used such an attitude towards her.

“In Ye Zao’s voice just now, she felt disdain and ridicule.”
