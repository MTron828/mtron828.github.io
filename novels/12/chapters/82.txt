Chapter 83: 073: Going to the capital, the anniversary party! 4

“Zhou Jianbang, you killed my daughter, I’ll fight you to the death!”

“Baby!”

Even though the people around were talking about her as if she was a murderer, ye Zao’s face didn’t change at all. He continued his action and gently patted the child’s back.

He lowered his eyes slightly, and his long eyelashes covered the emotions in his eyes.

“Urgh –”

At this moment, the child suddenly vomited a pool of blood.

“Wa wa wa wa...”the child, who was already close to death, started crying loudly again.

This cry was obviously much more energetic than before.

At the same time, the child’s expression also slowly turned better.

Seeing this, everyone’s faces were filled with shock!

If they had not seen it with their own eyes, who would believe that a little girl would have such ability.

Oh My God!

It was really too amazing.

To think that they had even suspected that the little girl would cause the death of this child.

Not only did she not have a child, but she even saved this child’s life!

“Baby! Baby, you’re Alright!”

“Thank you, little girl, thank you!”

The couple was so excited that they wanted to kneel down to ye Zao.

At the same time, thunderous applause sounded in the cabin.

Their blood was boiling.

“It’s nothing. You Don’t have to do this.”Ye Zao quickly helped the couple up and continued, “If I’m not wrong, this child should be born before the month is up, right?”

Chu Shuxiang hurriedly nodded. “Young Lady, you’re right. My Baby was born prematurely at seven and a half months pregnant. The system is much worse than a baby of the same age.”

Ye Zhuo continued, “That’s no wonder. It’s best for such children not to eat seafood. Take care to keep warm during normal times.”

“Thank you! Thank you! Little benefactor, What’s Your Name? Where do you live? When we reach the capital, the two of US will definitely thank you properly!”Chu Shuxiang was extremely regretful, just now, she actually did not believe this young lady and was even worried that she would harm her baby to death.

Sometimes, age was not equal to strength!

Although the little girl was young, her ability was not small at all.

If it was not for her today, the consequences would be unimaginable.

Moreover, although she had saved her child, she was not too proud of it. She had always been like this, neither proud nor impatient.

She was also not angry because she and the other passengers on the plane had misunderstood her.

This measure, this temperament.

Not to mention a little girl, even many adults could not compare to her.

“No need to thank me. Traditional Chinese medicine emphasizes the fate of doctors. I saved this child’s life by accident. It’s my fate with the child,”ye Zao said faintly. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Zhou jianbang said, “Benefactor, can you tell me your surname? You saved our child’s life. If we don’t even know the surname of our benefactor, how can we rest assured in the future?”

“My surname is Ye.”Ye Zao’s tone was indifferent.

After saying this, ye Zao walked to his seat.

Zhou Jianbang and Chu Shuxiang held the child in their arms and looked at ye Zao’s back. They memorized her surname in their hearts.

Seeing ye Zao return, Lin Sha was so excited. “Zao Zao, you were so handsome just now!”

At the beginning, Lin Sha was scared to death.

She thought ye Zao was going to get into trouble.

She didn’t expect ye Zao to turn the tables in the end!

He was so handsome!

Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly and said, “Of course, who asked me to be so good-looking?”

This scene was watched by an old man with white hair.

He looked at ye Zao with admiration in his eyes and then walked to the first-class cabin.

There were only four seats in the first-class cabin, so the space was very spacious.

On the right side of the row, an old man with white hair sat on the inner seat. The Old Man’s face was very pale, and he was leaning on the back of the chair to rest.

“Old Man.”

Hearing this, the old man slowly opened his eyes. “Fu Nian, what’s wrong?”

Sun Fu Nian lowered his voice and told the old man about what happened in the cabin.

Then he said, “Old man, I see that the young lady’s medical skills are very good. Why don’t we invite her over to take a look at you?”

The old man waved his hand. “I know my body.”His illness was a death disease and there was no cure for it. The old man no longer had any hope.

Hearing this, Sun Fu Nian sighed. “Are you really not going to try?”

The old man’s illness was very strange. The pain was unbearable when the illness started. If it continued like this, even a young man would not be able to endure for long.

“No need.”The old man laughed and said, “Fu Nian, I’m already so old. It’s natural for people to die. It’s nothing.”
