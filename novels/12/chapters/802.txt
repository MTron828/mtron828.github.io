Feng Xianxian smiled and looked up. “The press conference is about to begin. I will answer your questions in public.”

“At that moment, Zhou Dawei jogged over. “Xianxian.” ”

“Grandpa Zhou.”Feng Xianxian looked up at Zhou Dawei.

“Zhou dawei continued, “Let’s go in first.” ”

Feng Xianxian nodded.

Seeing so many people and seeing so many reporters...

Old Mrs. Lin faintly felt uneasy.

But there was nothing she could do now.

What to do?

What to do?

What should she do?

“”Ah, ah, ah...”Old Mrs. Lin opened her mouth anxiously, but she just couldn’t say anything. ”

“Zhou Dawei continued, “Have you brought the share rights and the will?” ”

“”Don’t worry, Grandpa Zhou, I’ve brought them all.” ”

Zhou Dawei nodded.

The LIN Group held an emergency meeting at the last minute.

11 o’clock sharp.

The press conference officially began.

“Feng Xianxian pushed Old Lady Lin to stand on the high platform, accepting the reporters’interviews, “Although Grandma isn’t my biological grandmother, she’s even closer than my biological grandmother. If not for this accident, I wouldn’t know that Grandma actually left everything to me. “Perhaps, she is completely disappointed in uncle Lin and Auntie Ye!” ”

Twisting black and white.

Feng Xianxian was twisting black and white!

“Old Lady Lin was so angry that her entire body was trembling. She glared fiercely at Feng Xianxian, and her eyes were terrifyingly red. ”

“However, in the eyes of outsiders, it was as if she was moved by Feng Xianxian. ”

“”Director Lin, what do you think about this?”The reporter handed the microphone to Lin Jincheng again. ”

“Lin Jincheng’s expression did not change, “The LIN Corporation was single-handedly taken down by my father. I believe that my mother will not easily hand it over to outsiders! Everyone has also seen that my mother is now completely paralyzed and unable to speak! Therefore, I now question whether the share rights deed and the will have any legal effect!” ”

“”Director Lin, do you mean that the share rights deed and will in Miss Feng’s hands are forged?” ”

“Yes.”

“Feng Xianxian raised her head and looked at Lin Jincheng, “Uncle Lin, as Grandma’s son, not only did you turn a blind eye to Grandma, you even chased the eighty-two-year-old grandma out of the House! “The reason why Grandma suffered a stroke and became paralyzed was all because of your anger! “Ask Yourself, have you ever fulfilled your responsibilities as a child? “You can’t rely on Grandma’s inability to speak to change the facts and question whether the letter of ownership and will were fake! “If you didn’t disappoint grandma, would grandma have left all of this to me?” ”

Old Lady Lin couldn’t speak now. The handprints on the will and the share concession were Old Lady Lin’s.

“At this moment, as long as Old Lady Lin didn’t speak, even if Lin Jincheng had eight mouths, he wouldn’t be able to explain it clearly! ”

“Feng Qianqian just looked at Lin Jincheng, her eyes concealing her pride. ”

“Soon, the Lin Corporation would be hers. ”

She did not disappoint Feng Qianhua!

As soon as these words were said.

“The reporters exploded, one after another, they handed the microphones to Lin Jincheng. “Director Lin, did you really chase Old Lady Lin out of the House?” ”

“Did you and your wife indirectly cause Old Lady Lin to become like this?” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Feng Xianxian’s eyes were red as she said, “Grandma is here today. She knows best whether I’m lying or Not! If she could speak, she would definitely explain this matter in front of everyone! Unfortunately, Grandma will never be able to speak again! Uncle Lin, as a child, don’t you feel guilty at all for harming Grandma Like This?” ”

“Who said that my grandma can’t speak?”

“At this moment, the door at the entrance was pushed open. ”

A slender figure walked in.

Against the light.

It was hard to see her face clearly.

But looking at her like this.

Every step was like the wind.

It was so cool that it made people want to scream.
