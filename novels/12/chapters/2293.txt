“”You’re really old and muddle-headed!”Elder Bai patted his head. Just as he was about to lie down, Bai Jingshu stood up from the front. “Grandfather!” ”

Elder Bai widened his eyes and looked at Bai Jingshu in disbelief. “Jingshu! You’re back?”

“”Yes.”Bai Jingshu grabbed elder Bai’s hand. “Grandfather, I’m back.” ”

“”It’s good that you’re back, it’s good that you’re back.”Old Master Bai grabbed Bai Jingshu’s hand. “GRANDPA DREAMED ABOUT YOU LAST NIGHT.” ”

“Unfortunately, Bai Jingshu didn’t come back after waking up from the dream. Because of this, Old Master Bai was sad for a long time. ”

“Fortunately, Bai Jingshu was back now. ”

“Seeing old master Bai like this, Bai Jingshu felt a little guilty. She should have gone back to Earth to visit her grandfather often. ”

“The old man was getting on in years, and they would see each other less often. How much time would they have to spend together in the future? ”

“Grandfather...”Bai Jingshu looked at Old Master Bai with red eyes.

“Old Master Bai held Bai Jingshu’s hand tightly, he smiled and said, “Silly Child, why are you still crying? I’m already very happy that you can come back to visit grandfather! “Quick, come in with grandfather. Grandfather has left a lot of things for you these past few days!”Old Master Bai had always doted on his granddaughter, Bai Jingshu, when Bai Jingshu was very young, he had kept all the good things for her until she was an adult now. ”

“In Old Master Bai’s heart, Bai Jingshu had always been a child who couldn’t grow up. ”

“When they returned to the house, Old Master Bai grabbed a bunch of grade-1 armor stones for her. ”

“These stones were very beautiful when used as decorations, but they were rarely seen in high-quality goods, so they were very popular with girls. ”

“Every time old master Bai encountered high-quality items, he would think of Bai Jingshu immediately. ”

“Although Bai Jingshu did not like ornaments made of grade-1 armor stones, she would keep them whenever old master Bai gave them to her. She would make them into ornaments to make old master Bai Happy. For example, this time, she wore a red armor stone bracelet. ”

“Under the sunlight, the red bracelet emitted a dazzling light, looking especially beautiful. ”

“Bai Jingshu took the first-grade armor stone and said with a smile, “Thank you, grandfather. Look, I made this bracelet out of the armor stone you gave me last time. Doesn’t it look nice?” ”

“”Yes, Jingshu looks good in anything!”Old Master Bai nodded. ”

“The grandfather and grandson chatted about their daily lives. After a while, Bai Jingshu looked at old master bai and said, “Grandfather, I’ve found a boyfriend.” ”

“Really?”Old Master Bai asked in surprise.

“Yes.”Bai Jingshu nodded and a smile appeared on her face.

“Old Master Bai continued, “Where are you from, young man? Do I Know You?” ”

“Old Master Bai’s greatest hope was to see Bai Jingshu get married with his own eyes. Otherwise, even if he closed his eyes, he wouldn’t feel at ease. ”

“Hearing this, Bai Jingshu was a little worried. After all, Lin Ze was from Earth. ”

What if...

What if grandfather was biased against Earthlings?

“After all, in the s galaxy, it was normal to be biased against Earthlings. ”

“”Grandfather, he, he might be a little different from what you think,”Bai Jingshu said tactfully. ”

“”How is he different?”Elder bai continued, “Is his body not good? Or is he... crippled?” ”

Bai Jingzhu’s words made elder Bai worried.

“As a grandfather, he would never allow his granddaughter to marry someone with a crippled body. ”

“Seeing that elder Bai might have misunderstood something, Bai jingzhu immediately explained, “It’s not that he’s crippled, it’s just that his identity is different from ours.” ”

Elder bai heaved a sigh of relief and smiled. “Your grandfather has never been the kind of person to have opinions about family status. Don’t worry.”

“Bai jingzhu continued, “He’s not from S Galaxy.” ”

“F Galaxy?”Elder Bai asked.

Bai Jingzhu continued to shake her head.

“Elder bai asked curiously, “Then where is he from? could he be from another galaxy?” ”

“”He’s from Earth,”Bai jingzhu continued, “But I love him very much. Grandfather, can you help us?” ”

“From Earth?”Elder Bai asked.

Bai Jingshu nodded.

“Elder Bai did not speak for a long time. He then asked, “Where is he from?” ”

“”Earth,”Bai Jingshu replied. ”

“Elder bai explained, “What I mean is where is he from on Earth?” ”

“The capital.”L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎
