“With that, Feng Qianhua turned and left with Feng Xianxian. ”

Feng Qianhua thought that Old Lady Lin would stop her.

But she didn’t.

“From the beginning to the end, Old Lady Lin didn’t say a word. ”

Now it seemed that.

The mother and daughter weren’t as important as Lin Ze in this old woman’s heart.

Feng Qianhua’s lips curled into a cold smile.

So...

“All these years of hard work she had put in, in Old Lady Lin’s heart, was not even comparable to a teenage child like Old Lady Lin. ”

How laughable!

How laughable!

The mother and daughter went outside.

“Feng Xianxian frowned. “Mom, are we really going out to look for her?” ”

“What else can we do?”

“But Beijing is so big. Where are we going to look for him?”

Feng Qianhua opened the car door. “Let’s get in the car first.”

The mother and daughter got in the car.

“Feng Qianhua said, “Xianxian, that old woman has a problem with us today. In order to dispel the resentment in her heart, we can only look for Lin Ze! Even if we can’t find him, we have to look for him!” ”

She had waited so long for Lin Jin city. She could not let Lin ze destroy it.

She had to take the position of the matriarch of the Lin family!

Feng Qianqian nodded.

“After Feng Qianhua and her daughter left, Old Mrs. Lin hurried downstairs and called the butler to ask about Lin Ze. ”

“”Old Mrs. Lin, we haven’t found the young master yet. But you don’t have to be anxious. We can definitely find the young master!” ”

Not Anxious?

How could she not be anxious?

Lin Ze was the only child in Lin Jin city.

“Moreover, this child was so filial! ”

“Whenever Old Lady Lin thought about how she had misunderstood such a good child, her heart would ache. ”

She almost couldn’t breathe!

“Ah Ze! You should be back soon! It’s Grandma’s fault! I’m Sorry!”Old Lady Lin cried anxiously.

...

On the other side.

Lin Ze carried his bag with one hand and walked to the crowded street.

He didn’t know where he should go either.

“At this moment, he was. ”

Alone and helpless.

Like a homeless orphan.

“Meow.”

“At some point, a dirty-looking cat followed Lin Ze. ”

“Lin Ze turned around to look at the cat, and a self-deprecating smile appeared on his face. “No one wants you either?” ”

“Meow.”

“No one wants me either.”

“Meow.”

“What’s Your Name?”

“Meow.”

“Lin Ze bent down and picked up the cat. He stroked its head. “Then, I’ll call you brother Meow from now on, Okay?” ”

“Meow.”

“Do you have a Mother?” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“This time, brother Meow did not meow anymore. His small head nudged Lin Ze’s chest. ”

“The corners of Lin Ze’s mouth curled into a wry smile. “You didn’t jump out of a rock. You definitely have a mother, right?” ”

“Meow.”

“I have a mother too.”Lin Ze carried the cat and walked aimlessly. “But she’s gone. I miss her so much.”

I miss her so much.

If he had a mother today.

Would grandma still treat him so indiscriminately?

“Lin Ze planned to start, but he didn’t expect the result. ”

“When Old Mrs. Lin’s slap landed, he was completely stunned. ”

He didn’t expect that old Mrs. Lin would slap him directly.

Just because of Feng Qianhua and her daughter’s words.

“When he passed by the small shop, Lin Ze bought a small bag of cat food and fed brother Meow. ”

Brother Meow looked extremely hungry.

He ate the cat food in two or three bites.

“Brother Ze.”

“At this moment, Li Wen’s voice sounded in the air. ”

“Mosquito?”

“Li Wen looked at Lin Ze and asked in surprise, “Brother Ze, what happened to your face?” ”

He saw that the right side of Lin Ze’s face was red and swollen.

“Lin Ze licked his back teeth and said in a flat tone, “I was beaten by my grandmother!” ”

“What?”Li Wen thought he was hearing things.

“”Yes, you didn’t hear wrong.” ”

Only when he heard Lin Ze’s voice again did Li Wen confirm that he wasn’t hearing things.

“It... It really was your grandmother?”

“In Li Wen’s impression, Old Lady Lin doted on Lin Ze very much. ”

“Usually, she couldn’t even bear to lift a finger. ”

Who would have thought...

“Lin Ze continued, “My grandmother even chased me out of the house.” ”

“It can’t be?”Li Wen was completely shocked.

Lin Ze nodded. “It’s true.”

“Li Wen knew that this wasn’t the time to talk, so he continued, “Brother Ze, you can go to my house first! Dog Two and fat tiger are at my house!” ”

“Okay.”Lin Ze turned around and followed Li Wen’s footsteps.

“Meow.”Brother Meow sat on the ground and meowed pitifully.

“Li Wen turned around. “Brother Ze, is this your cat?” ”

Lin Ze shook his head. “Why would I have such an ugly cat?”
