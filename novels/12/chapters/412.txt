Translator: 549690339

“Li Qiandong was like a puppet that had lost its soul. “I saw it, I saw everything...” ”

1

He had always thought that Mu Yourong was an innocent and kind girl.

He had even fallen out with his father for Mu Yourong.

But in the end?

What did he get in return?

He got endless lies.

He treated Mu Yourong as a good friend and confidant. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

But what did Mu Yourong treat him as?

She toyed with him like a fool.

“In the past, he had always resented Cen Shaoqing and Old Lady Cen for not being able to see the reality clearly. ”

“Actually, the person who was truly unable to see the reality clearly was him! ”

The true fool was also him!

He was a fool!

The biggest fool in the world!

“Scram! You Scram for me!”Li Qiandong directly flung mu yourong away. “You Disgusting Slut!”

“Mu Yourong fell to the ground, and a sharp pain surged up from her lower abdomen. She seemed to have suddenly remembered something. “Brother Li! I’m Pregnant! It’s your child! It’s your child! Let’s get married, brother Li!” ”

Yes!

She was already pregnant.

Li Qiandong could not abandon her.

Li Qiandong was stunned. He took a few steps back and leaned his back against the door frame.

His entire body was filled with sorrow.

He could not believe that Mu Yourong was actually pregnant with his child!

How could this be?

“Ye Zhuo walked to Li Qiandong’s side and patted him on the shoulder. “You’re just a Pan Xia! Don’t worry, that child isn’t yours.” ”

“”Ye Zhuo, what nonsense are you talking about?” ”

Ye Zhuo lowered his head and looked at Mu Yourong. He took out a pregnancy test report from his pocket. “This shows that you’re already one month pregnant.”

“One month ago, Mu Yourong felt that something was wrong with her body and went to the hospital for a check-up. ”

She did not expect that she was indeed pregnant!

But how did ye Zao get the pregnancy test report?

“Hearing this, Li Qiandong took the pregnancy test report from ye Zao’s hand. When he saw the words on it, Li Qiandong heaved a sigh of relief. ”

Almost.

He almost fell into Mu Yourong’s trap.

At this moment.

The sound of an alarm rang out from outside the door.

The police quickly went upstairs.

An ice-cold handcuff was placed on Mu Yourong’s hand.

Mu Yourong was officially arrested and brought to justice.

Downstairs.

Li Qiandong looked at the back of the police car as it left. He turned his head to look at ye Zao and Cen Shaoqing.

“”God, fifth brother, I was wrong! I’ve let you guys down!” ”

“When he reached the end of his sentence, Li Qiandong directly knelt on the ground and wept bitterly. ”

“When he thought of everything that had happened in the past, Li Qiandong was filled with regret. ”

He was the one who had misjudged people.

He was the one who was too stupid!

“If time could travel, he would definitely return to the past at all costs and punch himself awake. ”

“Unfortunately, time could not be repeated. ”

Cen Shaoqing looked at Li Qiandong and held the bright red Buddha Pearl in his hand. “I will tell Uncle Li to reinstate your position and take care of yourself in the future.”

One sentence had two meanings.

Li Qiandong also knew that he had gone too far.

“If he was Cen Shaoqing, he would not forgive himself. ”

“Let’s go.”Cen Shaoqing turned to look at Ye Zhuo.

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and followed Cen Shaoqing’s footsteps.

“Soon, the luxurious Maybach disappeared into the night sky. ”

Li Qiandong knelt on the ground and cried loudly.

The night soon covered his figure.

In the car.

Cen Shaoqing’s cell phone rang.

“Help me pick up the phone.”Cen Shaoqing controlled the steering wheel with both hands and turned his head to look at Ye Zhuo.

Ye Zhuo picked up the cell phone on the central console and answered the call. “Hello.”

The person on the other end of the screen was stunned.

Why was it a woman’s voice?

Did he make a wrong number?

“”I’m sorry, I called the wrong number.”After saying that, the person immediately hung up. ”

Ye Zhuo placed his phone back on the central console. “Wrong Number.”

But the next second.

The phone rang again.

Ye Zhuo picked up the phone again. “Hello.”

“The person on the other end hesitated for a moment before asking, “S-excuse me, is this Master Five’s phone?” ”

“If he had not experienced it himself, who would have believed that the phone of master five CEN, who was not close to women, was actually picked up by a woman? ”

“”Yes, wait a moment, I’ll let him talk to you.”As soon as he said that, Ye Zhuo leaned forward and handed the phone to Cen Shaoqing’s ear. ”

“”Hello.”Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips opened slightly, and his originally cold and thin voice seemed to be dyed with a layer of ice. “Let the four parties discuss the construction site in the south. I want to see the proposal of your planning department in three days...” ”

“He was already in a high position, so when he talked about work, he was full of the charm of a superior. ”

Ye Zhuo suddenly felt a little pity.

How could such an outstanding person be a monk?

“After hanging up the phone, Ye Zhuo put his phone back on the central control panel. He pulled open the car refrigerator and took out a box of desserts. ”
