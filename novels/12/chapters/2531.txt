No wonder.

Ye Zhuo curled his lips and looked up at Cen Shaoqing. “Then you’ve really offended my father.”

“What do you mean?”Cen Shaoqing asked in a low voice.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “After I talked to him last night, he really thought that you weren’t coming, so he flew into a rage.” ”

Lin Jincheng was indeed quite angry yesterday.

“After all, setting a date was a big day in one’s life. ”

“If Cen Shaoqing attended at this time, it was enough to show that he didn’t value ye Zhuo and the Lin family enough. ”

Cen Shaoqing curled his lips slightly. “It’s such an important day. How could I not come?”.

“After saying that, CEN Shaoqing continued to ask, “Is auntie angry?” ”

“”My mother isn’t angry,”ye Zhuo continued, “Not only is she not angry, but she’s also trying to excuse you. You didn’t see the look in my father’s eyes at that time.” ”

It was said that a mother-in-law liked her son-in-law the more she looked at him. This sentence made a lot of sense.

“Hearing this, the corners of Cen Shaoqing’s mouth curled up. “What About You? What did you think at that time?” ”

“”Of course I understand you,”ye Zhuo answered. ”

“Are you disappointed?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“It would be a lie to say that he was not disappointed. After all, it was a very important day. ” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“However, ye Zhuo still understood him very well. ”

“A little.”Ye Zhuo made a gesture with his hand.

“While the two of them were talking, they had already walked into the hall. ”

“When he saw Cen Shaoqing, Lin Ze, who was originally depressed, was suddenly stunned. ”

Was he seeing things?

“Otherwise, why would he see Cen Shaoqing? ”

Didn’t Cen Shaoqing not have the time to come over?

“Mr. Cen!”Bai Jingshu said in surprise when she saw Cen Shaoqing.

“You saw it too?”Lin Ze turned to look at Bai Jingshu.

Bai Jingshu nodded slightly. “Yes.”

“After she said that, Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “I thought Cen Shaoqing really wasn’t coming, but he still came. You, don’t keep a straight face.” ”

“Ever since he found out that Cen Shaoqing wasn’t coming, Lin Ze had been pulling a long face. ”

“Hearing that, Lin ze said somewhat awkwardly, “I didn’t pull a long face.” ”

“As long as he didn’t admit it, no one would know. ”

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “Okay, okay, okay. You didn’t.” ”

“Seeing Cen Shaoqing, Lin Jincheng was also a little surprised. ”

“He rubbed his eyes, but there was still no change in front of his eyes. A moment later, Lin Jincheng turned to look at ye Shu beside him and said, “Is that that kid from the Cen Family?” ”

“”That’s right.”Ye Shu smiled and said, “Are you feeling better now?”? “I was worried that Shaoqing wouldn’t come. I told you that Shaoqing wasn’t that kind of person, but you didn’t believe me. You were angry for a long time!”! “Look, it’s all in vain!” ”

“Lin Jincheng touched his head. “This kid, what game is he playing with me!” ”

“”You really are a person!”Ye Shu looked at Lin Jincheng and said somewhat speechlessly, “Shaoqing didn’t come and you’re angry. He came and you’re acting all weird again! What do you want?” ”

“Ah Shu! Why are you helping others? !”Lin Jincheng said somewhat speechlessly.

“How am I helping others?”Ye Shu asked.

“Lin Jincheng said, “You always speak up for outsiders, and you even say that you’re not helping others!”Lin Jincheng even suspected that Cen Shaoqing was ye Shu’s biological son! ”

“Even if he was his biological son, he wouldn’t be so attentive. ”

“You said that Shaoqing is an outsider?”Ye Shu asked.

“Lin Jincheng said exasperatedly, “Not only is he an outsider, he’s also a thief!” ”

“What did he steal from you?”Ye Shu asked.

“Lin Jincheng said, “He stole my precious daughter!” ”

“His precious daughter was going to be taken away by a pig like Cen Shaoqing. As a father, no matter how he thought about it, he didn’t feel good about it. ”

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “Look at you! The situation is getting smaller! You should think like this. From now on, our family will have one more family member!” ”

Lin Jincheng did not say anything.

“”Uncle and aunt.”At this moment, Cen Shaoqing held ye Zhuo’s hand and walked in front of the two of them. ”

Lin Jincheng was stunned.

“Ye Shu quickly reacted and smiled as she gave CEN Shaoqing a red packet. “Okay, okay, okay.” ”

“As soon as she finished speaking, ye Shu elbowed Lin Jincheng. ”

Lin Jincheng finally reacted and smiled. “Didn’t you say you weren’t coming? Why are you here all of a Sudden?”

Lin Jincheng felt that something was wrong.

Was Cen Shaoqing playing some tricks with him.

“After all, in Lin Jincheng’s eyes, Cen Shaoqing was just a pig who wanted to eat cabbage. ”

“Ye Shu quickly smiled and explained, “Shaoqing, what your uncle means is that he is very happy that you can come!” ”

“Cen Shaoqing explained, “I said that I couldn’t come earlier because I wanted to give Zao Zao a surprise. It was my thoughtlessness that made uncle and aunt worried!” ”
