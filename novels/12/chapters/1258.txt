Translator: 549690339

Doctor Liu had been in the surgery department for more than ten years.

How could he not be able to distinguish between external injuries and viral infections?

It was precisely because ye Zao was Miracle Doctor Ye and she had a huge halo around her that everyone trusted her so much.

“Director Zhang looked at doctor Liu and continued, “Then let me ask you. You said that Ye Sen did not have a viral infection, so are you confident that you can cure him?” ”

Doctor Li shook his head. “Ye Sen’s current condition is already beyond redemption!”

“”Since there isn’t any, then don’t be long-winded!”Director Zhang continued, “I believe in Miracle Doctor Ye!” ”

“But...”

“Just as doctor Li was about to say something else, the director waved his hand, “Alright, Alright, you can leave now! Be careful in the future. This time, it’s because Miracle Doctor Ye has a good temper and won’t lower himself to your level. If it were anyone else, the entire hospital would have suffered along with you today!” ”

“Seeing the hospital director acting like this, doctor Li did not say anything more. ”

“Ye Sen was now hopeless. Even if ye Zao did not interfere, he would still die. ”

It was just that he would suffer a little more before he died.

Ye Zao and Ye Shu arrived at the waiting area.

“Lin Jincheng hurriedly came forward and asked, “How is it?” ”

“Ye Shu said, “Zao Zao has already communicated with the hospital director. The surgery will be tomorrow.” ”

Lin Jincheng nodded.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Dad, take mom and Grandma back to rest first. Uncle will be performing the surgery tomorrow. You guys can just come over tomorrow.” ”

“Ye Shu’s eyes were red as she said, “With your uncle like this, how can I Sleep?” ”

“”Even if I can’t sleep, I still have to sleep. After the surgery tomorrow, Uncle Still Needs Your Care!”Ye Zhuo continued, “Don’t worry, uncle will be fine. You and Grandma should quickly follow Dad Back! Leave this to me.” ”

“Ye Shu said, “Zhuo Zhuo, you have to operate on your Uncle Tomorrow. Right now, you’re the one who should be resting the most.” ”

Ye Langhua nodded. “Your mother is right.”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “I’m fine. The director has arranged a lounge for me in the hospital. I’ll go to the lounge to sleep in a while.” ”

“After some persuasion, Ye Shu and ye Langhua agreed to go back with Lin Jincheng. ” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Seeing that ye Shu and the others had gone back, the Butler looked at father Zhao and said, “Master, why don’t we go back too? We can come back tomorrow?” ”

“”Nonsense!”Father Zhao said emotionally, “It turns out that the one lying inside is not your son!” ”

The Butler was so scared that he did not dare to say anything.

“It was not easy for Father Zhao to find his own son. Now that his son’s life was at stake, how could he be willing to leave! ”

Ye Zhuo could not be bothered with Father Zhao. He turned around and went to the waiting room arranged by the director.

“In the waiting room, he was planning the surgery tomorrow and the emergency measures. ”

“Early the next morning, Lin Jincheng and ye Shu came over with breakfast. ”

The two of them had only slept for one or two hours last night. Their mental state was not very good at the moment.

“”Zhuo Zhuo, you haven’t eaten yet, right? I asked the kitchen to prepare millet congee.” ”

“Ye Zhuo took the thermos bucket. “Mom, it’s still early. The surgery is scheduled for 10 am. You and my dad should go to the lounge and rest for a while.” ”

Lin Jincheng nodded and led ye Shu to the lounge.

Ye Zhuo sat down to eat the congee.

“After eating the warm millet congee, he felt his entire body warm up. ”

“At this moment, soft footsteps sounded in the air. ”

Ye Zao looked back slightly and saw a slender figure.

The man was wearing a retro long robe and holding a string of Buddhist beads in his hand.

“His face was cold, and he gave off a noble aura as he walked. ”

This was Cen Shaoqing.

“Seeing the person who came, Ye Zao’s eyebrows and eyes curved. All the tiredness disappeared in an instant. ”

“Aren’t you in country K?”

“I came back after I received the news that something had happened to uncle.”Cen Shaoqing sat opposite ye Zao and began to question him. “Why didn’t you tell me that something had happened to Uncle?”

“Ye Zao continued, “Weren’t you busy in country K? In addition, I only found out about it at midnight yesterday, so I didn’t have the time to tell you!” ”

“Ye Zao had thought that he would inform Cen Shaoqing after the surgery was successful, but he didn’t expect Cen Shaoqing to know about it. ”

And he even rushed back in such a short time.

“Don’t do this next time.”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “I heard that uncle’s condition is still serious. How is he now?” ”

“Ye Zhuo took a sip of porridge. “His condition is indeed not very good. The surgery will start at ten in the morning. If the surgery is successful, uncle will be fine. Once the surgery fails, Uncle Will...” ”
