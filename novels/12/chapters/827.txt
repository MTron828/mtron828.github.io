“Song Chenyu maintained his smile and asked in return, “Haven’t you heard that a fool has dumb luck?” ”

“Seeing song Chenyu like this, Cen Yuyan could only shake her head helplessly. Then, she sighed again, “I don’t know what my fifth brother can do to break up with Ye Zhuo.” ”

“”Their relationship is so good, how could they break up?” ”

“CEN Yuyan said, “Those who serve the monarch with lust will fall in love with Chi; those who serve the monarch with virtue will live on for a long time. Someone like ye Zao will be dumped by my fifth brother sooner or later!” ”

Song Chenyu narrowed his eyes.

It seemed that Cen Yuyan’s hatred of Ye Zao had reached the extreme.

“Chenyu!”

“At this moment, the director called Song Chenyu’s name. ”

“Song Chenyu stood up and said, “Yuyan, I’ll go over first.” ”

“You go ahead.”Cen Yuyan nodded.

Song Chenyu was quite popular in the industry.

“In addition to her good acting skills, she rarely took bad takes. After one scene, she had gained a lot of fans. ”

“Cen Yuyan sat at the side, resting her chin on her hands as she watched song Chenyu and the second male lead’s scenes. ”

Song Chenyu was starring in a xianxia drama.

“Her white clothes fluttered in the wind, and her exquisite facial features were so perfect that they couldn’t be any more perfect. She instantly killed all the actresses present, and she was also known as a beauty that only appeared once in five thousand years. She was simply a perfect match for Cen Shaoqing. ”

She did not know why Cen Shaoqing had taken a blind eye to Ye Zhuo.

Cen Shaoqing was not the only one who was blind.

Cen Yuyan felt that the entire Cen family was blind except for her.

No!

She had to set song Chenyu and Cen Shaoqing up.

The first person who knew Cen Shaoqing was song Chenyu.

What was Ye Zhuo?

What right did she have to snatch song Chenyu’s boyfriend.

“First, she snatched Cen Shaoqing away from Song Chenyu, and now, she even snatched Lu Xiu away from her. ”

“If she did not help song Chenyu, Ye Zhuo would really think that there was no retribution in this world! ”

Cen Yuyan wanted to let ye Zhuo know that there was a price to pay for snatching someone else’s boyfriend.

“At 11 pm, Song Chenyu finished filming the last scene and returned to the apartment. ”

The nanny Van had just stopped when Song Chenyu saw a figure standing at the door of the apartment.

Song Chenyu narrowed her eyes and turned to look at her assistant. “You guys can go back first. Come and pick me up at eight tomorrow morning.”

“”Okay, Sister Chenyu.” ”

Song Chenyu got out of the car and walked towards the entrance of the apartment.

The figure heard footsteps and immediately turned to look at Song Chenyu. “Chenyu.”

Song Chenyu looked at the person in surprise. “Lu Xiu?”

Lu Xiu nodded.

“Song Chenyu opened the door through facial recognition and said, “Come in with me quickly.” ”

Lu Xiu followed song Chenyu in.

“As soon as they entered, all the lights in the room lit up. ”

Song Chenyu hurriedly poured water for Lu Xiu. “Do you want tea or fruit juice?”

“”Just plain water,”Lu Xiu replied. ”

“Okay.”Song Chenyu nodded and poured a glass of plain water for Lu Xiu.

“After drinking a mouthful of water, Lu Xiu continued, “I’ve already done what you asked me to do last time.” ”

“Really?”Song Chenyu was overjoyed.

“Yes.”Lu Xiu nodded.

“Song Chenyu walked over and hugged Lu Xiu. “Lu Xiu, thank you.” ”

Lu Xiu was stunned. His heart was beating a little fast.

“Although song Chenyu was a big star in the entertainment industry and had gained the recognition of many people, there were still many resources that she could not get. ”

“If she wanted to get more resources, she had to resort to means. ”

“The entertainment industry was a place that ate people. Today, you stepped on me, and tomorrow, I stepped on you. ”

“If she did not think of a way to fight back, she would become the victim of someone else’s rise. ”

Lu Xiu was a big shot in the technology industry. The entertainment industry did not lack anything except for technical talents like Lu Xiu.

Song Chenyu did not think that this was a big deal.

“In the entertainment industry, what kind of intrigue had she not experienced? ”

“Some female celebrities, for the sake of the resources, accompanied the investors and directors, comparable to the escort girls in the red-light district. ”

What was she doing?

“At most, she hugged Lu Xiu. ”

“During the filming, she had hugged countless male actors. ”

Lu Xiu was different from song Chenyu.

“Song Chenyu was an actor, while Lu Xiu was a person in the technology industry. Other than song Chenyu, he had never been so close to anyone of the opposite sex. ”

This was also why Lu Xiu had liked song Chenyu for so many years.

He always felt that there was hope for him.

“If song Chenyu did not like him, would she do this to him? ”

“A moment later, song Chenyu let go of Lu Xiu and continued, “How long have you been waiting at My Door? Why didn’t you call me in advance?” ”

“Lu Xiu said, “I didn’t wait for a while.” ”

Song Chenyu nodded.
