Chapter 647: 150: a strong comeback. Feng Xianxian was dumbfounded. It turned out to be ye Zao! 3

He had never felt this way before.

“The moment ye Zao applied the needle on him, he knew that he would not die. It was as if the sun was shining on the earth. ”

“Seeing this scene, everyone in the main hall was stunned. ”

Especially Feng Qianhua and Feng Xianxian.

“How, how could this be? ”

Wasn’t Master Yu already dead?

Why did he suddenly come back to life?

“Feng Xianxian almost lost her composure. Feng Qianhua grabbed Feng Xianxian’s arm and whispered, “This isn’t necessarily a bad thing for us.” ”

Master Yu admired Feng Xianxian’s calligraphy and even praised her.

This meant that master Yu had already acknowledged Feng Xianxian as his disciple.

Feng Xianxian also thought of this and the anger in her heart dissipated a little.

Yes.

She couldn’t lose her composure.

She still wanted to become Master Yu’s disciple.

So What If ye Zao knew medicine?

Did she know calligraphy?

Did she know how to write articles?

Ye Zao didn’t know any of these!

“When the time came, she would still crush ye Zao. ”

Feng Xianxian clenched her fists.

Old Lady Lin was also surprised.

She never expected ye Zao to really know medicine!

“Not only did he know medicine, he even saved Master Yu. ”

“Just a moment ago, she was still denying ye Zao. ”

She did not expect ye Zao to turn the tables.

Old Lady Lin’s face turned red and she took two steps back awkwardly.

“Lin Qingxuan looked at Lin Jincheng excitedly. “It’s Alright! Jincheng, master Yu is Alright!” ”

Lin Jincheng was also very excited.

He had thought that something had really happened to master Yu and had even made all his plans. He did not expect that master Yu would actually wake up!

Ye Shu was not very surprised.

This was because she had always known that ye Zao’s medical skills were very good.

“Lin Ze was not very surprised either. Although he had not spent much time with ye Zao, he knew that this younger sister of his was young and mature. She had never done anything that she was not confident in, much less put herself in danger. ”

“Assistant Ma also reacted at this moment. “Old Master, are you really alright?” ”

“I’m Alright!”Master Yu stood up.

“Not only was she alright, she even felt full of energy. ”

“Master Yu turned to look at Lin Jincheng and ye Shu. “Jincheng, you two have raised a good daughter!” ”

“”Thank you, Master Yu.” ”

Feng Xianxian was extremely jealous.

She hated herself for not learning medicine.

“If she knew medicine, what would happen to Ye Zhuo? ”

“After saying that, master Yu turned to look at Old Lady Lin, “Elder sister-in-law, your granddaughter is a rare and good child. She is already so skilled at such a young age. Her future is bound to be limitless! You are her biological grandmother. You should believe in her and support her more! “If even you don’t believe in her, how many people in this world will believe in her?” ”

Although master Yu had just fainted.

He was still conscious.

He had heard everything that Old Lady Lin Said and did.

“If Lin Jincheng and Lin Qingxuan had not stepped forward in time, ye Zao would have given up on the treatment. ”

“Old Lady Lin was already a little embarrassed. After hearing Master Yu’s words, she became even more embarrassed. She tried her best to smile. “Zao Zao, this child is still young. I’m afraid that she won’t be able to control her actions...” ” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“”Don’t you know your own granddaughter?”Master Yu looked at Old Lady Lin. “If she didn’t know what to do, she wouldn’t have snatched me back from death.” ”

“The smile on Old Lady Lin’s face could barely be maintained. However, ye Zao did not react at all. ”

“If it was Feng Qianxian, Feng Qianxian would definitely speak up to help her out. ”

But what about Ye Zhuo?

He was like a mute!

Even his own granddaughter!

He wasn’t even comparable to an outsider.

“Ye Zhuo handed a prescription to master Yu. “Master Yu, your body hasn’t fully recovered yet. You still need to take medicine to recuperate. This is the prescription. Just follow the instructions on the prescription to brew the medicine and drink it.” ”

“”Alright.”Master Yu took the prescription with both hands. “Little girl, thank you.” ”

“It was written in black and white, and it was very relaxed. ”

It was a very standard small regular script.

“At first glance, it looked very comfortable. ”

Subconsciously.

Master Yu felt that this handwriting was somewhat familiar.

It was as if he had seen it somewhere before.

“Thinking of this, master Yu frowned. ”

Could it be that he had seen wrongly?

No one could predict ye Zhuo’s future.

“You are too polite.”Ye Zhuo smiled slightly. “This is the duty of a doctor.”

She was neither arrogant nor impatient.

“Even though she had been doubted by others before, now that she had turned the tables and made everyone’s eyes light up, she was still extremely proud and arrogant. ”
