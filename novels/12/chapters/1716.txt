Director Ma’s eyes lit up when he heard this.

“Although the CEN base had arranged cars for them, they were just ordinary cars. His and professor Feng’s car configurations were around one million. ”

“Compared to the ten million luxury cars in C nation, they were not just a little bit inferior! ”

It seemed that his decision to leave the CEN base was really right.

“If they did not leave the CEN base, how could they have such a luxury car? ”

“Director ma smiled and said, “I’m satisfied! Very satisfied. Dr. Cara, thank you for your trouble.” ”

“”It’s my pleasure.”Dr. Cara nodded with a smile and continued, “Also, considering the good relationship between the two of you, the Villa I arranged for the two of you is also next to each other. The two of you won’t mind, right?” ”

“Director ma continued, “You’re too thoughtful! We can’t thank you enough, so why would we mind?” ”

“During this period, professor Feng didn’t say anything. ”

“Director ma nudged Professor Feng with his elbow, reminding her to thank Dr. Cara. ”

“Professor Feng looked at director Ma and continued, “Dr. Cara, don’t worry. Director Ma and I will definitely contribute to C nation’s science and Technology.” ”

“”I am relieved with Professor Feng’s words!”Professor Cara continued, “You must be tired after a night on the plane. Go back and rest! I will arrange a car to pick you up tomorrow.” ”

“Okay.”Professor Feng nodded.

“Director Ma, Professor Feng, and the others walked to the car. ”

“Looking at their backs, professor Cara suddenly realized that something was wrong. He lowered his head and looked at the assistant beside him. “Professor Feng came alone. Does she have any relatives in China?” ”

“Director Ma and his family came along, but Professor Feng was alone. ”

“”Professor Feng has a mother besides her daughter,”said Jamila. “But her mother is old and stubborn. She doesn’t want to come, so she still stays in China!” ”

Dr. Cara nodded.

“Until the two cars disappeared in front of them, Dr. Cara and the others turned around and left. ”

“About an hour later, the car stopped in front of the two villas. ”

“Professor Feng’s daughter, Feng Ying, was already waiting at the door. When she saw her mother get out of the car, she immediately ran over. “Mom!” ”

“”Ying Ying!”Since the last time they met, professor Feng had not seen his daughter for more than three years. When he saw Feng Ying running over, Professor Feng excitedly hugged Feng Ying. ”

The mother and daughter hugged each other.

“”Mom, I’ve waited for so many days. I’ve finally waited for you to come!”Feng Ying said with slightly red eyes. ”

“Professor Feng helped Feng Ying Wipe Her Eyes. “Silly child, isn’t mom here?” ”

“Feng Ying nodded and looked into the car. “Mom, Where’s Grandma? Does she get Carsick?” ”

“When he mentioned grandma, Professor Feng’s eyes dimmed. He continued, “Your grandma didn’t come.” ”

“Hearing that, Feng Ying said in surprise, “Why? Why didn’t Grandma Come? Did you not let Grandma Come?” ”

“Feng Ying hadn’t seen Grandma for more than three years. Thinking of how her grandma treated her quite well when she was young, Feng Ying originally thought that she would take this opportunity to be filial to Grandma! She didn’t expect Grandma to not come at all. ”

“”It was your grandma who didn’t want to come,”professor Feng continued, “She said that she would die on the land of China.” ”

“Hearing this, Feng Ying frowned. ”

She didn’t expect her grandmother to not come with her.

“Professor Feng sighed and said, “You know your grandmother’s character. If she doesn’t want to, it’s useless even if others say it.” ”

Professor Feng was also reluctant to leave her mother alone in C nation.

But she couldn’t do anything about it.

She couldn’t stay in China with her mother.

“”So you just left Grandma in China?”Feng Ying looked at professor Feng and continued, “Grandma is already 89 years old this year!” ”

How could an 89-year-old old man have the ability to take care of himself?

“Moreover, Professor Feng had just betrayed the CEN base. Not to mention other things, the people in the CEN base would not let the Old Lady Live Well. ”

“Thinking of this, Feng Ying became even more nervous. She continued, “Mom, how could you bear to do that?” ”

“”Then what do you want me to do?”Professor Feng looked at Feng Ying and sighed, then, he said, “Don’t worry, Yingying. Your grandmother will be fine. Before I left, I especially asked Auntie Wu to take good care of your grandmother. I will send money to her every month.” ”

“Really?”Feng Ying asked

Professor Feng nodded. “Of course it’s true. Your grandmother is my mother. Can I just leave her alone?”Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com
