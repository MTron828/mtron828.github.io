Translator: 549690339

“Zhou Xiang said, “Mom, don’t worry. Jinbei was just confused for a moment. He will definitely be filial to you and dad in the future.” ”

“Okay.”Xie wanqiu nodded. “I believe that I watched that child grow up in Jinbei. How can I not know what kind of personality he has?”

“Wanqiu!”Zhou Zuolong suddenly said.

“”Old Man, What’s Wrong?”Xie wanqiu raised her head to look at Zhou Zuolong. ”

Zhou Zuolong turned around and walked out of the door.

Xie wanqiu had no choice but to follow Zhou Zuolong’s footsteps.

The two of them walked outside.

“Xie wanqiu smiled and said, “What’s wrong? What can’t be said inside? Why do you have to say it outside?” ”

“Zhou zuolong said, “We can’t just let Zhou Xiang bring yinyin back.” ”

Xie Wanqiu was stunned.

“Then what do you mean?”

“Zhou zuolong continued, “Our yinyin has everything she wants. She’s also a top student. The number of people chasing after her can be counted on ten fingers. It’s not like she can’t get married. If we let Zhou Xiang bring her back just like that, wouldn’t people say that she’s a pervert?” ”

“He had raised Zheng Wanyin since she was young. If she was labeled as a pervert, where would he put his old face? ”

Zhou Zuolong was a person who valued face very much.

His face was more important than anything else.

Xie wanqiu nodded. She felt that Zhou Zuolong was very right.

“Then what should we do?”Xie wanqiu asked.

“Zhou zuolong said, “We have to let the Cen family come to the hospital personally to bring yinyin back and hold a welcoming banquet. We have to let everyone in the capital know that they were the ones who invited Yinyin back. She’s not some random person who came knocking on our door!” ”

“”Then we have to let Xiang Xiang’s mother-in-law come and pick her up personally,”Xie wanqiu continued. “After all, Old Lady Cen is the oldest and most senior person in the CEN family.” ”

Wasn’t Bai Tang arrogant?

Didn’t she always claim to be the Cen family’s Old Lady?

Then she had to make Bai Tang’s prestige suffer and let Bai Tang come and pick Zheng Wanyin up personally.

“Zhou Xiang was the daughter-in-law that Bai Tang had personally chosen. At the same time, Bai Tang also listened to Zhou Xiang very much. As long as Zhou Xiang spoke, Bai Tang would definitely compromise. ”

Zhou Zuolong nodded. “You’re right. We should let Bai Tang come and receive her personally.”

“Xie wanqiu sighed. “Although that’s what you said, what if Bai Tang doesn’t want to come?” ”

“”She doesn’t want to come? Why shouldn’t she come?”Zhou zuolong said angrily, “If it wasn’t for your sake, do you think that I would be willing to marry yinyin to the capital? The Cen family being able to marry yinyin is simply the virtue of their ancestors! They still dare to disagree? She has no right to disagree!” ”

“Xie wanqiu said, “The onlooker is clear, the person in the middle is confused. Old Man, don’t forget that Bai Tang and the Cen family are the ones in the middle now. They think that ye Zhuo is the best one!” ”

“Then let Zhou Xiang make a scene!”Zhou Zuolong said.

“Zhou Xiang was the only daughter-in-law of the CEN family. If Zhou Xiang was seeking death, would old lady cen still dare to sit idly by? ”

“Xie wanqiu frowned. “Is, is this okay?” ”

“Zhou zuolong said, “There’s nothing bad about it. Just do as I say.” ”

“Alright then.”Xie wanqiu nodded. “You’re the head of the family. Whatever You Say Goes.”

The head of the family.

Zhou Zuolong was completely pleased by these words.

“Not only was he the head of the Zhou family, he would also be the head of the CEN family in the future. ”

“In a flash, Zhou Zuolong and Xie Wanqiu returned to the ward. ”

“Seeing the two of them enter, Zhou Xiang immediately stood up from his chair. “Dad, Mom, you’re back. It’s getting late. I’ll take Wanyin back first.” ”

Zheng Wanyin also packed her things and followed Zhou Xiang’s footsteps.

“Once she stepped out of this door, she would be the young mistress of the Cen family! ”

“Zhou zuolong suddenly said, “Wait.” ”

“”Dad, is there anything else?”Zhou Xiang turned to look at Zhou Zuolong. ”

“Zhou Zuolong leaned back on the chair, peeled a betel nut, and stuffed it into his mouth as he chewed, he said, “Our Yinyin is a pure and innocent young lady. She has to have a degree, a degree, and a good appearance. I’m not bragging, but in the entire sea city and even in the entire China, there aren’t many people who are more outstanding than yinyin. How could you bring yinyin back just like that?” ” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Zhou Xiang did not expect Zhou Zuolong to say such words all of a sudden.

Zheng Wanyin was even more surprised. She turned to look at Xie wanqiu.

Xie wanqiu smiled at her.

“After receiving Xie Wanqiu’s reply, Zheng Wanyin heaved a sigh of relief. ”

“”Dad, what do you mean now?”Zhou Xiang asked. ”

“Zhou Zuolong slammed the table and stood up. “You UNFILIAL Thing! Tell me, did you do it on purpose? Did you deliberately want to see me make a fool of Myself?”Zhou Xiang said that he wanted to bring Zheng Wanyin back as soon as he arrived, he saw that Zhou Xiang had done it on purpose. He had deliberately made Zheng Wanyin throw herself at him so that everyone would laugh at him! ”

“If he had not been smart enough to think of something, he would have been schemed against by Zhou Xiang. ”

How could there be a daughter like Zhou Xiang in this world?

“”Dad, What are you talking about?”Zhou Xiang could not understand Zhou Zuolong’s words. ”

“Xie wanqiu hurriedly said, “Old man, if you have something to say, say it properly to the child. Why are you throwing a tantrum?” ”

“”For the sake of your mother, I won’t hold it against you today,”Zhou Zuolong continued, “Evil daughter, listen well. Go back and get your old lady to come over and personally set up a banquet to bring yinyin back! Our yinyin was not raised by some small family!” ”

Want his yinyin to fall for him?

No Way!

What?

Get Old Lady Cen to come over personally to pick up Zheng Wanyin?

Zhou Xiang’s face turned pale.

“She, she, did she hear correctly? ”

“Old Mrs. Cen was not as easy to talk to as she was. If Old Mrs. Cen heard Zhou Zuolong and Xie Wanqiu’s intentions, Old Mrs. Cen would flip the dining table! ”

“”Dad, you, you mean to ask my mom to come and pick up Wanyin?”Zhou Xiang asked. ”

“”Yes.”Zhou Zuolong nodded. “If your old lady doesn’t come, don’t even think about letting Yinyin enter the CEN family! Then our father-daughter relationship will come to an end!” ”

“Zhou Zuolong knew that Zhou Xiang didn’t dare to sever their father-daughter relationship, so he dared to threaten her repeatedly with this matter. ”

“”Dad.”Zhou Xiang gulped, he tried his best to be tactful and said, “My mom is old and her resistance isn’t good. Places like the hospital are full of germs. Actually, it’s the same for me to pick up Wanyin. Don’t worry, no one will gossip behind her back.” ”

Listen to what Zhou Xiang said. What nonsense was this?

Bai Tang’s body was so precious that she could not even make a trip to the hospital!

“”So it’s just me and your mother who deserve to die. We should be the only ones staying in the hospital, right?”Zhou Zuolong was so angry that his face was red, “That old woman can’t even make a trip to the hospital! Zhou Xiang, Oh Zhou Xiang, you’re really my good daughter!” ”
