“Where’s senior?”

Two anxious voices sounded in the air. One was Zheng Yuanjie’s and the other was Dr. Warne’s.

“”Dr. Warne, Yuanjie, Big Boss is in the car.”Chu Zimo licked his lips. “But you have to be mentally prepared. Big Boss is very young!” ”

“After he said that, he opened the back seat door. “Big Brother, we’re here.” ”

Ye Zhuo walked out of the car.

“Chu Zimo continued to introduce, “Big Brother, let me introduce you. This is my colleague, Zheng Yuanjie. You can call him little zheng. This is the elder of our scientific and technological circle, Dr. Warne. Yuanjie, Dr. Warne, this is Niu Hulu YC.” ”

After he said that.

Zheng Yuanjie and Dr. Warne were stunned when they saw ye Zhuo.

They were speechless for a long time.

The little girl in front of them looked like she was about eighteen or nineteen years old.

She had an extremely good appearance.

But appearance did not represent ability.

The Science and Technology Circle was not the entertainment circle.

The Science and Technology Circle did not look at faces.

Which one of the people who had achieved success in the science and Technology Circle was not a postdoctoral student?

“This little girl probably had not even stepped into the threshold of a university yet, right? ”

Dr. Warne and Cen Yuanjie’s current mood was the same as Chu Zimo’s when he had just met Ye Zhuo at the airport.

“Zheng Yuanjie was the first to react. “Zimo, don’t joke with us.” ”

She was too young!

How could such a young girl be Niu Hulu YC?

“Therefore, Zheng Yuanjie’s first reaction was that Chu Zimo was joking with him. ”

“Chu Zimo said very seriously, “I’m not joking with you. This is really NIU Hulu YC!” ”

The air fell into a strange silence again. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

It was really her?

“Zheng Yuanjie gave Chu Zimo a look, indicating that he should stop joking. ”

“Chu Zimo shook his head with a serious expression, indicating that he was not joking. ”

Zheng Yuanjie was stunned.

“Although Chu Zimo liked to joke, he never joked about serious matters. ”

Could This really be Niu Hulu YC?

Niu Hulu YC was so young!

“Ye Zhuo turned to look at Dr. Warne. “Dr. Warne, do you still remember the discussion about Project W on the Internet?” ”

“Dr. Warne was stunned for a moment, then nodded and said, “Yes.” ”

Ye Zhuo then took out a document from his bag. “This is my proposal. We agreed to meet and give it to you.”

Dr. Warne took the document with both hands and flipped through two pages. His face was filled with surprise.

This was an excellent technological proposal!

It was unprecedented and unprecedented.

“If it was brought to the scientific and technological world, it would definitely shock everyone. ”

It was indeed the work of Niu Hulu YC!

It was her!

This was Niu Hulu YC!

It was really her!

Dr. Warne’s hand that was holding the document was trembling.

He was extremely excited.

“After a long while, Dr. Warne finally reacted and stretched out his hand to ye Zhuo. “Hello, senior, I’m Warne!” ”

“Although ye Zhuo was young, she was quite capable. ”

“This temperament of hers, which was unperturbed by flattery, could not be replicated by others! ”

“Therefore, she was worthy of calling Dr. Warne a senior. ”

“She was completely convinced by this senior, Dr. Warne! ”

“Ye Zao reached out to hold Dr. Warne’s hand and said concisely, “Niu Hulu YC.” ”

“In her previous life, Ye Zao had been addressed as a senior by countless people. Therefore, when Dr. Warne called her a senior, she did not feel that there was anything wrong with it. ”

“Chu zimo smiled and said, “Professor, Big Brother, this is not a place to talk. Let’s talk after we enter the hotel.” ”

“”Yes, yes, yes. Let’s talk inside. Senior, this way please.”Professor Warne immediately made a ‘please’gesture. ”

Ye Zhuo and professor Warne walked in front.

Zheng Yuanjie and Chu Zimo walked behind.

“Zheng Yuanjie said in a low voice, “Is that really a big brother?” ”

Chu Zimo nodded. “Why else do you think the doctor respected her so much?”

“Zheng Yuanjie looked up at the back of leaf burning, silently swallow throat. ”

“Just yesterday, he and Chu Zimo are still speculating that the Big Brother is an old grandpa. ”

I didn’t expect the slap to come so soon.

“Not only is this guy not a grandpa,. ”

She’s a little girl.

This is so exciting!

The four arrived at the pre-booked conference room.

Dr. Warne took out his computer and prepared to discuss the problem with Yezao.

“Ye Zhuo looked down at the mobile phone, “Wait for me ten minutes, I first in the hands of the two tasks to deal with, will soon exceed the time.” ”

“”Big, Big Brother, you use the mobile phone to do a task?”Chu Zimo looked up to Ye Zhuo. ”

“Ye Zao hummed, her expression indifferent. ”

“Her casual answer shocked the three people in the room, including Dr. Warne! ”
