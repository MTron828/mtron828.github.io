Sparrow!

This damned old woman actually called her a sparrow.

Duanmu Fengyu was so angry that her face turned pale.

She was the eldest daughter of the Duanmu family and was born with the highest status. What was this old woman to her? She was just a lowly person on earth! What right did she have to treat her like this!

“But at that moment, other than enduring, she could only endure. ”

Wasn’t she just an old woman?

Just wait and see!

“She would definitely have a way to make this old woman acknowledge her and treat her as a treasure in her hands, making the old woman regret her actions today. ”

“”Old Lady, you really know how to joke.”Duanmu Feng forced out a smile. “However, both Phoenixes and sparrows are birds. It’s not wrong for you to say so.” ”

Are Phoenixes and birds alike?

This is hilarious!

“Cen old lady did not hesitate to say: “Sure enough, sparrows are sparrows, even if fly on the branches, also can not reach the height of the Phoenix!” ”

What the hell does that mean?

Is she being sarcastic about her lack of experience?

“Duanmu Feng had never been wronged like this since she was a child. She endured the sourness in her eyes, tried hard to maintain the curvature of her mouth, and spoke softly, “Old Lady, you must be hungry after talking for so long. Eat something first. These pastries are made by me personally. Try it and see if it suits your appetite. If it doesn’t suit your appetite, I’ll make it again.” ”

“She put a mysterious seasoning in the pastries. It was extracted from a rare plant. Not only was it harmless to the body, but it also had a nourishing effect. As long as one took a bite, one would fall in love with it. ”

“This way, no one would notice anything and the old lady would be pleased. In the future, she would have to be her granddaughter-in-law. It was killing two birds with one stone. ”

“Thinking of this, Duanmu Feng’s eyes lit up. ”

Just wait. The day when the dead old lady would regret it was not far away!

“”Duanmu sparrow, listen carefully,”old lady cen looked at Duanmu Feng and said, she continued, “As for me, although I’m old, I know very well what you’re thinking. “I advise you not to waste your time on me. There’s no need to put on an act in front of me. If you don’t feel embarrassed, I’ll feel embarrassed for you! “I don’t think you’re old. Can’t you be a good person? “Do you have to embarrass yourself?” ”

Old Mrs. Cen understood Duanmu Fengyu’s thoughts very well. She just wanted to take a shortcut to please her and get in the middle of the relationship between Cen Shaoqing and Ye Zhuo.

“”Old Mrs. Cen, you, you misunderstood me…”Duanmu Fengyu looked pitiful. “I’m not what you think I am.” ”

“”Misunderstanding? I misunderstood you?”Old Mrs. Cen straightened her expression, “Young lady, I’ve walked more bridges in my life than you have. Stop pretending in front of me! “Let me tell you, my eldest grandson already has a girlfriend. Your actions are immoral. Your aunt has already embarked on a path of no return. As her niece, you should be even more chaste! “I don’t think you’re ugly. Why do you have to think of ways to be a mistress?” ”

Mistress?

She was a mistress?

Did this damn old woman figure out the issue at hand?

Who was the real mistress!

“She was the legitimate fiancée of Cen Shaoqing, but now she was the mistress! ”

Ridiculous!

This was ridiculous!

“Duanmu Feng looked up at Old Mrs. Cen and said, “Old lady, Dongli and I are engaged.” ”

She was reminding old Mrs. Cen that she was not a mistress. Ye Zhuo was the real mistress.

“”Dongli? Who Is Dongli? My eldest grandson is called Cen Shaoqing!”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Duanmu Sparrow, I’m telling you, don’t be so Shameless!” ”

“Duanmu Fengyu tried not to get angry. “Old Madam, I know that you might not be able to accept me for a while, but even if you are unwilling to accept me, the truth is the truth.” ”

Old Madam Cen was angry.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“She felt that she had already given Duanmu Feng Face, but this woman did not seem to understand human language. ”

“”My old madam has lived for so long, but this is the first time I’ve seen a woman come knocking on my door.”Old madam CEN continued, “Duanmu sparrow, even if your whole family kneels on the ground and begs me, I won’t allow you to marry into our Cen family, let alone come knocking on My Door!” ”

“At this point, Old Lady Cen paused, she said somewhat speechlessly, “A sparrow is a sparrow! Something that can’t be put on the table! Why Don’t you look at yourself in the mirror and See What You Are! You’re simply polluting the environment! No wonder the environment of Your Alliance is so bad! It’s because of the existence of people like you!” ”
