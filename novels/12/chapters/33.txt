Chapter 34: The Day She Regretted It Would Come!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Ye Zhuo was actually here to discuss her resignation. But why... why would she want to resign, huh?

Qian Lingyu chuckled and then said, “Little Ye, the business in the shop is getting busier these days. I can see that you’re a speedy worker, so why don’t you stay and become a full-time employee? I will increase your monthly wage by 500 bucks; this is an offer that no one else gets.”

Ye Zhuo’s current salary was 2500 bucks a month, so her salary would be 3000 bucks with the 500 bucks increment.

3000 bucks was not a small number. In fact, Qian Lingyu was just doing this to prove herself right about Ye Zhuo. She could almost tell Ye Zhuo’s next move. Ye Zhuo would certainly be very excited. It was an additional 500 bucks, after all.

“You’ve misunderstood, aunty.” Ye Zhuo then said, “This is not related to salary, but it’s because I’m about to go back to school soon.”

What? Did she refuse the offer even with the 500 bucks of increment?

Qian Lingyu looked at Ye Zhuo in astonishment. She did not expect Ye Zhuo to be so greedy for money to the point where she would even use going back to school as an excuse to renegotiate terms.

She was a young girl out in the working world, so how would school reopening be related to her? There was a slight tint of mockery in Qian Lingyu’s eyes that was not very distinct.

Qian Lingyu had observed that Ye Zhuo worked very diligently and believed it was because she wanted to continue to work here once her agreement expired; could she really bear to bring herself to leave?

Qian Lingyu was certain that she was doing all this for no other reason than to push up her pay because Ye Zhuo realized that business in the barbecue shop was getting better these few days.

Nonetheless, she had already given her a 500 bucks increment; what more did Ye Zhuo want? In addition, the reason behind the business of the barbecue shop getting better was not because of Ye Zhuo! It was because of her original barbecue recipe!

Ye Zhuo was truly shameless! Did she really think that she was some fairy maiden?

Was she implying that it was because of her physical appearance that the business of the barbecue shop improved exponentially with lines out the door? What a joke!

The reason why Qian Lingyu decided to give Ye Zhuo 500 bucks of increment was out of pity for Ye Zhuo. She did not expect that Ye Zhuo would be so unappreciative and even want to seize the opportunity to extort more money from her!

Did Ye Zhuo really think that her experience as the shop owner for so many years was all for nothing?

Qian Lingyu continued, “Since you’ve already made up your mind to leave, I won’t keep you then. I will settle the account of your salary the day after tomorrow after closing.”

Ye Zhuo wanted to pull a smart trick on her, huh? No way!

“Alright. Thank you for taking the trouble to do that.”

After Ye Zhuo left, Li Boyang walked out of the house. “Mom, is Ye Zhuo resigning?”

He heard Ye Zhuo mentioning something about returning to school earlier. Could it be that Ye Zhuo was really still in school? Did he misunderstand Ye Zhuo?

Qian Lingyu turned around and replied, “She’s not resigning; she is trying to put up a front with me! She really thinks that she is someone important, huh!?”

“Put up a front? Put up what sort of front?” Li Boyang asked in puzzlement.

Qian Lingyu continued, “She can see that our business is getting better these days with her own eyes, right? She is assuming that the situation was contributed by her face! As a result, she is using her resignation to threaten me, so I will agree to increase her salary!”

Li Boyang nodded. “So that is the case, huh? So, did you increase her salary then, mom?”

Qian Lingyu answered, “I agreed to increase her salary by 500 bucks, but she thinks that it’s too little! She wants to resign, right? I shall fulfill her wish and allow her to resign then! If I have the money, I can hire as many staff members as I want. Does she think that the world stops revolving when she leaves?”

Li Boyang was stunned for a moment.

“So, is Ye Zhuo really resigning?”

Qian Lingyu smiled and said, “Don’t worry; she’s only doing this to scare me! She won’t bear to leave! The salary offered by our business is considered high in this area! That’s not even including the additional 500 bucks per month I’ve offered her; where else can she get a job as good as ours here?” Perhaps no other place could offer such a high salary in the entire Yunjing Province.

“Ah.” Li Boyang nodded and felt relieved.

Time passed quickly, and two more days passed in the blink of an eye.

It was Ye Zhuo’s final day working in the barbecue shop today.

It was quite a coincidence that Granny Cen, who had not turned up for three days, had actually come tonight.

“Granny Cen, where did you go for the past few days?” Ye Zhuo was delighted to see Granny Cen.

Granny Cen answered, “I had a headache for a few days, so I laid in bed and rested for two days.”

“Are you alright, Granny Cen?” Ye Zhuo had only just realized that something was off about the color of Granny Cen’s face. She stretched out her hand to examine Granny Cen’s pulse with her full attention.

After a moment, Ye Zhuo loosened her grip on Granny Cen’s hand. “Granny Cen, you’ve been having this headache issue for the past 20 years, right?”

Granny Cen looked at Ye Zhuo in astonishment. “Ye Zi, how did you know?”

“I know a little about the traditional Chinese medicine practice.”Then,?Ye Zhuo continued, “Granny Cen, I’ve encountered someone with a headache like yours before. If you trust me, I have a prescription that will cure your problem.”

“Really?” Granny Cen’s eyes lit up brightly as she looked at Ye Zhuo.

Her headache was not an issue on usual days, but when it flared up, she could almost die from the agony to the point that she could not even get up from her bed. She would be in pain for two to three days in a row. She would get these headaches about once every month.

So, now that she heard that Ye Zhuo had a prescription that could cure her headache, she was elated.

Ye Zhuo nodded, picked up a pen, and wrote down the prescription on a notepad. Then, she tore the paper off and passed it to the granny. “This is the prescription; keep it.”

Granny Cen received the prescription. “Alright. Thanks, Ye Zi!”

Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “It’s just a small favor; oh right, what would you like to have tonight?”

In response, Granny Cen read out the names of a few dishes.

After Granny Cen finished her meal, Ye Zhuo informed Granny Cen that she was leaving the next day.

Upon hearing that, Granny Cen looked at Ye Zhuo as if she was unwilling to part with Ye Zhuo. “Oh Ye Zi, you’re leaving, huh? So I won’t be seeing you again from now on, right?”

Ye Zhuo said with a smile, “Granny Cen, I’ve written my phone number on the prescription. If you miss me or if you encounter something, you can call my number to reach me. Oh right, there’s this too. Keep it.” Upon saying that, Ye Zhuo took out a stack of cash notes from her pocket and stuffed it into Granny Cen’s hands.

Ye Zhuo had withdrawn the money from the bank in advance. It was not easy for an old woman to live alone, so Ye Zhuo wanted to do something to the best of her abilities for the old woman.

Granny Cen’s eyes reddened. “Thank you, Ye Zi.” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“You’re welcome.”

The shop closed by midnight, and Ye Zhuo went to look for Qian Lingyu.

Qian Lingyu passed an envelope to Ye Zhuo and said, “There’s two months’ worth of salary here.”

Ye Zhuo received it with both her hands. “Thank you.”

Qian Lingyu continued, “Have you really considered the offer and decided to leave?”

“Mmhmm.” Ye Zhuo nodded.

In response, a faint smile appeared on Qian Lingyu’s face. “I wish you the best of luck in your new job then.”

Ye Zhuo frowned ever so slightly. She could not figure out why Qian Lingyu constantly thought that she dropped out of school. Hence, she figured that she might as well not explain herself anymore. She smiled and thanked Qian Lingyu.

Qian Lingyu gazed after Ye Zhuo’s departing silhouette and sneered once.

Just wait! It will not take three days before Ye Zhuo regrets her decision! By then, she would certainly come back to beg her shyly.

The next morning, the family of three sat in the living room to have breakfast.

Ye Shu said, “Zhuo Zhuo, my body is well already. I will be going back to work in the barbecue shop from today onward.”

After one month of recuperation, Ye Shu was looking much better that even the wrinkles on her eyes faded. She looked just like a different person, and her face was glowing with health.

Meanwhile, Ye Zhuo peeled the egg in her hand leisurely. “I’ve already resigned from the job at the barbecue shop. The job is exhausting, and the salary is too low. There’s no need for you to work there anymore from now on.”

Hearing that Ye Zhuo had already quit the job, Ye Shu panicked a little. “Zhuo Zhuo, I know that you pity me, but I really am well now. I’m not doing anything at home anyway. Even though the barbecue shop doesn’t pay well, I can still make a little money to subsidize the expenses.”

Ye Shu did not want to become a deadbeat who relied on the support of her daughter. Furthermore, she certainly did not want to become her daughter’s burden.

Ye Zhuo took a sip of milk and then raised her head to look toward Ye Shu. “Mom, if you really feel that you can’t stand being bored at home, I have an idea.”

“Go ahead.”

Ye Zhuo continued, “I have some spare money with me now. I’m thinking of renting a shop and getting you to manage it. I can see that the food business is doing pretty well, so why don’t we open up a shop then?”

“Is… is that doable?” Ye Shu furrowed her brows ever so slightly. “I don’t have the skill; will anyone come to dine in a shop that I own?”

Ye Zhuo chuckled and said, “I thought uncle and you frequently praise me for cooking well? I can teach you! If the business is doing well, we can hire staff members to help out too.”
