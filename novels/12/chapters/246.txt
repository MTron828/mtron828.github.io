“Ye Shu was very happy to hear that she was praised for her beauty. She said humbly, “Not bad.” ”

“Mom.”Ye Zhuo walked up to Ye Shu with an umbrella in hand.

Big Sister Lan sized up ye Zhuo carefully.

“She thought that ye Zhuo looked good from afar just now, but now that she was close to him, she was even more amazed. ”

“Before this, sister Lan had never seen such a good-looking girl! ”

She was really too beautiful!

There was not a single blemish on her face.

“Sister Lan felt that if her results were a little better, it would be more than enough to match her son. ”

“Ye Shu introduced sister Lan to Ye Zao. “Zao Zao, this is your Aunt Lan.” ”

“”Hello, Aunt Lan.” ”

“”Good, good.”Sister Lan nodded and continued to ask, “I heard that you guys are taking the math exam this afternoon, right? is the exam difficult?” ”

“It’s not too difficult.”Ye Zao’s tone was shallow.

Math was her strong point. She only spent an hour to finish it.

“Sister Lan only thought that ye Zao was bragging, she smiled and said, “Little girl, you are so beautiful. It doesn’t matter even if you don’t do well in the exam! You still have a long way to go in life. Don’t be discouraged! My Son is also taking the exams inside. His results are very good. This time, he will definitely be able to get into a good university! When that time comes, he will be able to bring glory to our family!” ”

Ye Zhuo frowned slightly. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Why did she feel that this Auntie Lan’s way of speaking was strange?

“Mom!”

“At this moment, another voice sounded from the side. ”

“”Baby!”Big Sister Lan quickly turned around. “Baby, you must have had a hard time taking the exam for so long, right? Give me the pencil case and I’ll hold it for you!” ”

“This was big sister Lan’s son, Wang Xiaobao. ”

“Wang Xiaobao was thin and not tall. Standing beside Ye Zao, he was a lot shorter than big sister Lan. ”

“After saying that, big sister Lan introduced her baby son to Ye Shu. “This is my son, Wang Xiaobao. His nickname is Baby.” ”

“Ye Shu nodded because she really had no words to praise him. She could only say, “Sister Lan, your son looks so spirited!” ”

“Sister Lan said happily, “This child has been spirited since he was young. He’s also smart. People say that he’s a literary star that descended from heaven...” ”

Wang Xiaobao looked at sister Lan impatiently. “Why are you talking so much nonsense? I want to go home! I want to eat! I’m Hungry!”

“”Oh, baby is hungry! I’m so sorry! Look, Mom forgot. Let’s go, Let’s go home quickly!”As he said that, he squatted down. ”

“Just when ye Shu didn’t know why Big Sister Lan squatted down, at this time, Wang Xiaobao actually leaned on big sister Lan! ”

“Then, Big Sister Lan stood up with Wang Xiaobao on her back. ”

Carry?

“Such a big child, he actually had to carry it? ”

Ye Shu was stunned!

“Not only was ye Shu stunned, even ye Sen and Ye Zhuo were dumbfounded. ”

What kind of trick was this? !

“Ye Sen walked to Ye Shu’s side and said in puzzlement, “Sister, is that child sick? His legs aren’t Good? I think his mental state is quite good!” ”

“Ye Shu shook her head. “I’m not sure, but he shouldn’t be sick. Sister Lan has four daughters and only one son. He’s probably spoilt.” ”

“Ye Zhuo frowned slightly. “No wonder I felt that Auntie Lan’s way of speaking was a little weird. It turns out that she prioritizes boys over girls! If she spoilt her son like this, he won’t have a good ending in the future.” ”

“”Who says so?”Ye Shu was not a talkative person, but she could not help but say a few words. “In order to raise this son, big sister Lan even gave away two daughters!” ”

Ye Zao sighed endlessly.

He really could not understand that there was actually someone who valued sons over daughters to such an extent.

He was even willing to throw away his own daughter.

“Ye Shu continued, “Oh Right, Zao Zao, how did your math test go?” ”

“It was alright.”Ye Zao nodded.

“The family of three talked as they walked. Not long after, they arrived at the parking spot. ”

“When they passed by a black car, ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly. He subconsciously felt that this car was quite familiar. ”

“However, she did not recognize the license plate number. She looked back and took another look. Unfortunately, the window was closed and she could not see if there was anyone in the car. ”

She could not see the car from the outside.

“However, the person sitting in the car could clearly see the outside of the car. ”

The moment she looked back.

Everything in the world became quiet.

She held a white umbrella.

She wore a blue dress.

It was as if she had become one with the curtain of rain.

“Through the layers of raindrops, her face could still be seen clearly. ”

“The sky was blue, waiting for the Misty Rain. ”

And I was waiting for you.

Song Shiyu stopped tearing the candy wrapper in his hand.

Their eyes met.

“His heart, which had already festered to the depths of darkness, seemed to have a warm sun shining in. ”
