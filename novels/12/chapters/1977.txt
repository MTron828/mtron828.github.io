Translator: 549690339

“Take them away.”Ye Zao opened his red lips.

The few police officers immediately took control of Mi Chen and Xu Yao.

Xu Yao had just had her amniocentesis and was very weak now. How could she have the strength to resist.

“Mi Chen did not struggle. She raised her head and said, “What’s wrong with the police? Can the police arrest people without any reason? What’s Your Police Officer’s identity? I’m going to Sue You!” ”

“Ye Zao curled his lips slightly. “You want evidence, right? I’ll satisfy you!” ”

“After he said that, ye Zao pressed the watch on his wrist. ”

Beep.

A transparent screen immediately appeared in the air.

The transparent screen showed the video of the car recording device.

Mi Chen was sitting in he ziteng’s car.

“He took out a pair of pliers and a tool knife, lowered his head, and did something to the car. In a moment, he went around to the front of the car and opened the front cover. ”

“After he had done everything, Mi Chen sat back in the car. ”

The corners of his mouth curled up into a sinister smile.

“When he saw this video, Mi Chen was immediately stunned. ”

What was going on?

He had clearly deleted the video on the car recording device. Why was there still one? !

“But very quickly, mi chen calmed herself down, she continued, “What can a mere video represent? That’s right. That day, I moved Ziteng’s car. That was because Ziteng’s car had a malfunction. I was just helping him fix it!” ”

That’s right.

He was just fixing his car.

“Don’t be in such a hurry to defend yourself. There’s also this.”

Ye Zhuo switched to another video.

“In the video, Mi Chen was hugging Xu Yao as they sat on the big bed in He Ziteng’s room. ”

“”Mi Chen, have you really settled the matter of He Ziteng’s car accident? The police won’t find out about it, right?” ”

“”Don’t worry, I’ve long deleted the video in the car recording device. How can those idiots find out about it? In your dreams!”Mi Chen’s face revealed a disdainful look at the end of her sentence. ”

“”Just you wait. It’s going to be those two old guys’turn soon! After I kill those two old guys, the He family will be ours!” ”

Mi Chen’s face was pale and cold sweat was dripping down her forehead.

He had never expected that there would be surveillance cameras in he ziteng’s room.

“Under normal circumstances, who would install surveillance cameras in their room? ”

“Of course, Mi Chen wouldn’t know. ”

“Ever since ye Zao found out about he ziteng’s injuries, he felt that there was something very wrong with Mi Chen and Xu Yao. Hence, he secretly investigated he ziteng’s car accident. He didn’t expect that she would actually find out the problem. ” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“After learning that Mi Chen had tampered with the car, ye Zao had someone secretly put an invisible surveillance camera in he ziteng’s bedroom. ”

The He family’s parents took a few steps back in disbelief.

“None of them had expected that this was not he ziteng’s imagination, nor was he ziteng dreaming. ”

Xu Yao and Mi Chen were actually in cahoots.

“Seeing this scene, mother he finally could not hold it in any longer. She walked up to Xu Yao and gave her a hard slap. “B * Tch, you B * Tch! My son treated you so well in vain! You are simply a snake with a scorpion’s heart!” ”

“Xu Yao was jolted awake by this slap, she cried out, “Auntie! I was wronged! It was all his fault! It was all because of Mi Chen who forced me, Auntie! It was all because of that B * Tch Mi Chen who forced me! Auntie, I’m pregnant with Zi Teng’s biological child and your biological grandson. Please forgive me this once! I promise that I won’t dare to do it again... “... “...” ”

“No matter what, she couldn’t go to jail. ”

She couldn’t be sentenced.

The child.

Yes.

She still had a child.

The He family definitely wouldn’t just stand by and watch the child turn a blind eye.

“He’s mother couldn’t take it anymore, so she rushed over and gave mi chen a slap. “Adulterers and adulterers!” ”

“Very soon, Mi Chen and Xu Yao were brought to the police car. ”

“Looking at the police car that was far away, the He family’s parents walked up to Ye Zao. “Miss Ye, you’re the benefactor of our he family. The three of us don’t know how to thank you anymore. We... We’ll kowtow to You!” ”

“As they spoke, the three of them knelt down towards ye Zao. ”

They were truly grateful towards ye Zao.

“If ye Zao hadn’t brought out the evidence in time, at this moment, their entire family would have been deceived by the adulterous couple, Mi Chen and Xu Yao! ”

What would happen next would be unimaginable.

“According to Mi Chen’s methods, he would really exterminate the he family. ”

“Ye Zao quickly helped the three of them up and continued, “Mr. He and Mrs. He, you’re too polite. He ziteng is not only a member of the base, he’s also a good friend of Shao Qing. Based on our two layers of relationship, I won’t just stand by and watch.” ”

“After saying that, Ye Zhuo looked at he ziteng. “Everyone makes mistakes. Let bygones be bygones. In the future, when you find a girlfriend, listen to your parents’opinions.” ”
