“Ye Shu asked, “Were you and Feng Qianhua engaged at that time?” ”

She was very concerned about this matter.

“If Lin Jincheng was really engaged to Feng Qianhua at that time, then she was a third party, and she owed Feng Qianhua an apology. ”

“So, she needed an accurate answer. ”

“Lin Jincheng shook his head, “No, I was never engaged to her. At that time, we were about the same age, and the two families were close friends, so the elders had the intention to set us up and proposed the engagement, but I rejected it very clearly. After I rejected Feng Qianhua, she married Feng Qianxian’s biological father.” ”

“Hearing this, ye Shu heaved a sigh of relief. “Actually, Feng Qianhua came to look for me back then.” ”

“What?”Lin Jincheng was very surprised. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Ye Shu continued, “At that time, she came to me with a big belly. She told me that she was pregnant with your child. She said that she was your fiancée. I was the one who broke up the two of you…” ”

“Lin Jincheng did not expect Feng Qianhua to have done such a thing, he hurriedly explained, “No, I didn’t! Ah Shu, I really didn’t. Please believe me! The child in Feng Qianhua’s belly was Feng Qianxian’s biological father! Think about it. If that child was really me, would my mother have let it go?” ”

“A smile appeared on the corner of Ye Shu’s mouth. “To be honest, I was really desperate at that time.” ”

“Lin Jincheng hugged ye Shu with reddened eyes. “Ah Shu, I’m sorry…” ”

Ye Shu hugged Lin Jincheng back.

“After a long while, the two of them separated. ”

“Lin Jincheng said, “Ah Shu, it’s been a tiring day. You should go and rest first. Don’t worry. Before you completely let go of the knot in your heart, I’ll sleep on the sofa.” ”

“Ye Shu glanced at him. In a trance, she saw the former Lin Qingcheng again. ”

Next door to the two of them was ye Zao.

“Ye Zao sat on the carpet with a computer on his lap. With one hand on the floor and the other on the keyboard, he jumped so fast that only his afterimages could be seen on the keyboard. ”

“However, this person still looked indifferent. ”

“At this moment, there was a knock on the door. ”

“”Come in,”ye Zao said calmly. ”

The door was pushed open and Lin Ze came in with a bowl of sweet soup. “Do you want some sweet soup?”

Ye Zao raised her eyebrows slightly.

“If she remembered correctly, this was the sixth time Lin Ze had knocked on the door. ”

The first time was to deliver fruits.

The second time was to deliver desserts.

The third time was to ask her if she wanted coffee…

“”Thank you, Brother.”Ye Zao stood up, took the sweet soup with both hands, and took a sip. “It’s very delicious.” ”

Lin Ze scratched his head. “It’s good that you like it.”

“After saying that, he turned around and left ye Zao’s room. ”

Ye Zao looked at Lin Ze’s back and suddenly realized that this brother of his was a little cute. What was up with that?

…

The Lin family’s eldest daughter had a glorious time at the banquet. The matter of her crushing Feng Qianxian was made known to everyone the next day.

Those who knew the inside story naturally knew that Feng Qianxian had asked for it.

“However, those who were not at the banquet thought that the Lin family’s eldest daughter was using her power to bully others. ”

“When Zheng Zhilan heard about this matter, she immediately went to look for Feng Xianxian. ”

“Feng Xianxian was also an actress. With just a few simple words, she had made her good friend Zheng Zhilan stand up for her, “Xianxian, that Lin family’s eldest daughter is really too much! Just you wait! I will definitely get my brother to stand up for you!” ”

“Feng Xianxian sniffed. “Forget it, Zhilan.” ”

“Zheng Zhilan was a young lady with a strong sense of justice. Furthermore, Feng Xianxian had saved her before. “No! We can’t just let it Go! How about this, you are in charge of inviting that Miss Lin out. Leave the rest to me and my brother!” ”

“Zheng Zhilan’s brother, Zheng Zimo, had always had a good impression of Feng Xianxian. ”

He was very willing to work for Feng Xianxian.

Feng Xianxian was also aware of this.

“”B-but, is this really good?”Feng Xianxian looked hesitant. ”

“Zheng Zhilan sighed. “A kind person will be bullied! Xianxian, you have to toughen up for me this time!” ”

“Seeing Zheng Zhilan like this, Feng Xianxian could only reluctantly say, “Then, then alright…” ”

“After bidding farewell to Zheng Zhilan, Feng Xianxian went straight to Ye Zhuo. “Ye Zhuo, do you have time to go out for a cup of tea with me tomorrow? I have something to tell you.” ”

Ye Zhuo lowered his eyes and looked at Feng Xianxian with an indifferent expression.

“Last night, she had indeed found something through tracing. ”

The incident 19 years ago was very likely related to Feng Qianhua.

She wanted to see what Feng Qianxian was up to.

Ye Zhuo nodded. “Where are We Going?”

“Feng Qianxian did not expect ye Zhuo to agree so quickly. A smug look flashed across her eyes. “Tomorrow at 11 am, Charm Cafe.” ”

“Okay.”

The next day at 10:50 am.

Feng Qianxian and Zheng Zhilan appeared at Charm Cafe.

“Zheng Zhilan held Feng Xianxian’s hand. “Xianxian, when my brother tries to trick her later, don’t pity her!” ”

Feng Xianxian nodded awkwardly.

“At 10:58 am, Zheng Zimo appeared in the cafe. He looked at his watch. “She’s not here yet?” ”

“Zheng Zhilan shook her head and pulled Zheng Zimo to sit down. “Brother, let me tell you, you have to help Xianxian vent her anger later!” ”

“”Don’t worry, leave it to me.”Zheng zimo smiled and said, “I have the most experience dealing with green tea like her.” ”

“Having been in a wealthy family for so many years, what rank of green tea had Zheng Zimo not seen before? ”

A smug look flashed across Feng Xianxian’s lowered eyes.

11 o’clock sharp.

A slender figure walked in.

“She was wearing a white shirt that was not stained with lead dust. The hem of her shirt was casually tied at her waist, giving her a somewhat unruly appearance. ”

She also had a hint of coldness.

“Her legs were long and straight. Her face was not covered with makeup, but it was so beautiful that one could not take their eyes off her. Her standard Phoenix eyes were sparkling. ”

“Is it her?”Zheng Zhilan looked at Feng Xianxian.

Feng Xianxian nodded. “It’s her.”

“Zheng Zhilan turned to look at Zheng Zimo. “Brother, it’s her…” ”

“However, before Zheng Zhilan could finish her sentence, Zheng Zimo stood up and said somewhat excitedly, “Yezi? !” ”
