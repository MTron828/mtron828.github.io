“Are you mistaken?”Zhou Ziyue asked.

“The assistant shook his head. “That’s exactly what Madam said. If you don’t believe me, you can call her and ask.” ”

“Zhou Ziyue narrowed her eyes, her expression unsightly. ”

What was going on?

What the hell was going on!

“The house had been taken care of, but ye Shu was not willing to pay. How were they going to deal with the rest of the matter? ”

Zhou ziyue came to ye Sui’s side with an ugly expression.

Ye Sui was chatting happily with the sales lady.

This was the first time she enjoyed the feeling of being courted by others. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Ye Sui turned around and saw Zhou Ziyue. He asked curiously, “Where’s your aunt?” ”

“She went to pay first?”

Ye Sui naturally felt that ye Shu would definitely help them pay for the villa.

“Zhou Ziyue did not answer ye Sui directly. Instead, she held ye Sui’s hand and smiled. She looked at the sales lady and said, “Miss, I’m sorry. We still want to take a look. We won’t buy it for the time being.” ”

“After saying that, Zhou Ziyue pulled ye Sui and walked out. ”

“Ye Sui said speechlessly, “Why are you pulling me? Why aren’t you paying? What’s going on? Where’s your aunt?” ”

“Let’s go out first.”

“The sales lady looked at their backs and said in a low voice, “Why are you pretending to be rich if you don’t have money? What Bad Luck!”She laughed for a long time at the side. So she was a poor person! ”

Zhou Ziyue pulled ye Sui out of the door. Ye Sui shook off Zhou Ziyue’s hand. “What’s going on?”

“Zhou ziyue continued, “Mom, Stop Dreaming. She Won’t pay for you!” ”

“Her?”Ye Sui was stunned. “Who? Your Aunt?”

“Yeah.”Zhou Ziyue nodded.

“Ye Sui continued, “Where is she?” ”

“”She went back early!”Zhou Ziyue held back the anger in her heart. “She’s so rich herself. So what if she bought us a villa! But Mom, do you know what she said?” ”

“What did she say?”Ye Sui asked.

“Zhou ziyue continued, “She said that she doesn’t have the money to lend us for the time being.” ”

“What!”Ye Sui widened his eyes in excitement.

“”Yes, you heard it right, that’s what she said!”Zhou Ziyue couldn’t hold back the anger in her heart in the end, then, she said, “I said that we shouldn’t come to the capital to humiliate ourselves. She didn’t treat us as relatives at all. Now that this has happened, do you think you look good?” ”

“They didn’t mention the matter of borrowing money the entire time, but ye Shu directly said that she didn’t have any money to borrow! ”

What was this?

This was an insult!

“Ye Sui was ye Shu’s biological sister after all, but ye Shu actually treated her like this! ”

She was simply an ingrate.

“Zhou ziyue continued, “Once this person gets rich, he will be ungrateful. Even if I told you, you wouldn’t listen! Now, not only are you insulted, but I’m also insulted!” ”

Zhou Ziyue was very angry now! She had never been so bluntly insulted before.

“Ye Sui also didn’t expect such a thing. She originally thought that when ye Shu paid them the other money, she would pay without hesitation. Wasn’t this just a villa? Ye Shu definitely didn’t take it seriously. ”

Who knew!

Who knew that ye Shu would actually care about such a thing!

This was too much!

“”Alright, Alright, don’t be angry anymore.”Ye Sui continued, “I’m still her sister. Don’t worry, she’s just saying it. How about this, let’s go back first. I’ll explain these things to her face to face.” ”

“Zhou ziyue continued, “This kind of person. You want me to break up with Feng Yang and then ask her to introduce me to someone. Do you think she will?” ”

Of course not!

She could finally see that ye Shu was a hypocrite!

She was extremely shameless.

“Let’s go back first.”Ye Sui suppressed the anger in his heart.

Zhou Ziyue did not say anything more and followed ye Sui’s footsteps.

The speed of the car was very fast.

They arrived at Lin Manor in a short while.

“Looking at the huge Lin Manor, Zhou Ziyue and ye Sui felt even more indignant. ”

Why did ye Shu live in such a huge villa and not even buy a small villa for her? !

What did Lin Jincheng see in her?

What right did she have to be the mistress of the Lin Family? !

Ye Sui looked at the maid beside him. “Where’s My Sister?”

“”Madam is resting in her room,”the maid said. ”

Ye Sui did not say anything else and walked straight to Ye Shu’s room.

“She wanted to push the door open and enter, but the door was equipped with an intelligent lock, so strangers couldn’t open it. ”

“Shu! Shu!”Ye Sui reached out and knocked on the door.

“After knocking for a long time, no one opened the door. Ye Sui frowned slightly. “Shu! where is she? Open the door!” ”

“Ye Shu was really too much now. Not only did she not buy her a villa, but now she didn’t even open the door! ”

“”Madam Zhou!”At this moment, a servant walked over from the side. ”

“What’s Wrong?”Ye Sui turned to look at the servant.

“The servant continued, “Are you looking for Madam?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Sui nodded.

“The servant said, “Madam isn’t at home.” ”

Not at home?

“Ye Sui was already very angry. After hearing this, she became even angrier. “Not at home? If she’s not at home, where did she go? Didn’t you guys just tell me that she’s resting at my place?” ”

What did they mean?

Were they playing with her?

Now even a servant could bully her like this?

Ye Sui was very angry!

“The servant continued, “Madam just went out.” ”

Just went out?

How could it be such a coincidence!

“Open the door and let me take a look!”Ye Sui said.

She wanted to see what kind of trick ye Shu was playing!

“The servant said somewhat awkwardly, “Madam did indeed go out.” ”

“Ye Sui said angrily, “Okay! Then I’ll go wait for her in the living room!” ”

“Ye Shu wasn’t out. She was clearly in the bedroom, hiding and not daring to see her. ”

She wanted to see how ye Shu would come to the living room!

“After saying that, ye Sui walked downstairs. ”

“Ye Sui waited in the living room for more than an hour, but he didn’t see her. ”

“Not long after, footsteps came from outside the room. ”

Ye Sui frowned slightly.

Was she really outside?

“A moment later, ye Shu walked in with something in her hands. ”

“Ye Sui smiled. “Little Shu, where did you go?” ”

“Ye Shu said, “I went out to buy some things.” ”

“I see.”

“Ye Shu looked at ye Sui and asked, “Did you need something from me?” ”

Now she didn’t even call him sister anymore!

“Ye Sui suppressed the anger in his heart and continued, “Little Shu, you were at the sales office just now. Why did you suddenly leave?” ”

“Ye Shu said, “You were the one who bought the house. I was also delayed there, so I came back early.” ”

“Then did you forget something very important?”Ye Sui asked tactfully.

She was giving ye Shu a way out.

“As a sister, Ye Shu should buy her a house. ”

Which sister would be as unpresentable as ye Shu and run away when it was time to pay!

How Shameless!

“What is it?”Ye Shu asked.

“Ye Sui didn’t expect ye Shu to pretend to be ignorant. Since ye Shu was shameless, she didn’t need to care about ye Shu’s face anymore. “You forgot to pay!” ”

These words were very reasonable.

“Pay for what?”Ye Shu asked.

“”To buy a house,”ye Sui said. ”

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “I’m not buying a house. What kind of money am I paying for?” ”

“Ye Sui was extremely angry, but he still controlled his emotions, “Little Shu, I’m your sister! We’re a family! Since we’re a family, what’s the point of separating us? You’re already so rich, do you still care about a small villa?”She didn’t make any outrageous request! ”

“You mean you want me to buy a house for you?”Ye Shu asked.

“Ye Sui said, “What do you mean by buying a house for me? We’re sisters, it’s only right for us to help each other!” ”

“Speaking up to this point, ye Sui paused and continued, “Why don’t you lend me some money?” ”

“‘lend’was just another way of saying it. As long as ye Shu borrowed money, ye Sui wouldn’t return it! ”

“”I don’t have money to lend you,”ye Shu said. ”

“”No Money?”Ye Sui looked at ye Shu and questioned, “How can you not have money! Little Shu, you can’t Be Like This! When you were in trouble back then, I didn’t hesitate! How can it be your turn to be like this!” ”

Ye Sui’s tone was full of disappointment.

“”Think about it carefully. Back then, did you owe me that 300 yuan?” ”

“Ye Shu looked at ye Sui and made eye contact with her. “If it weren’t for that 300 Yuan, you wouldn’t even be able to enter the Lin family.” ”

Ye Sui was stunned.

“”I advise you to quit while you’re ahead.”Ye Shu continued, “You and I don’t have any sisterhood to begin with.” ”

“Saying this, Ye Shu turned around and left. ”

It took ye Sui a long time to react. He stomped his feet in anger.

“When he returned to his room, Ye Sui was still very angry. ”

“Zhou ziyue said sarcastically, “I already said that she doesn’t treat you as her sister, but you insisted on coming over! Back then, Granny Liu even gained a lot of benefits when she entered the Grand View Garden! At the very least, everyone in the Jia family was polite to her. But you, you’re even worse than Granny Liu!” ”
