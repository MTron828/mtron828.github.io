Chapter 184: 087: so it’s Ye Zao! Old Lady Cen was trying to trick Cen Shaoqing! 4

Ye Zao picked up a lychee and gently peeled off the thin lychee skin with his little fingernail.

Sizzle —

The snow-white lychee meat was exposed from the thin green skin with a hint of red. The air immediately gave off a sweet smell of lychee.

After taking a small bite, the juice instantly flowed in all directions. The Sweet Taste had a faint fragrance that ordinary lychees didn’t have.

It was very delicious!

“Grandma Cen, is this a green lychee?”Ye Zhuo looked back at the Old Lady Cen.

The Old Lady Cen nodded hurriedly. “Yes, Cen Zhuo, you really have good taste! Legend has it that the lychee that Tang Xuanzong coaxed imperial consort Yang back then was a green lychee. How is it? Doesn’t it taste good?”

Because of this poem, the later generations all said that Imperial Consort Yang ate a lychee with imperial consort Yang’s smile.

In fact, it was not.

The lychee was only one of the poems in the three poems of the Huaqing Palace. It was not a type of lychee.

As for the Lychee, it was just a gimmick created by the later generations for the sake of marketing.

“It’s very delicious!”Ye Zhuo nodded.

“If it’s delicious, then you should eat more. But peeling lychees takes too much effort. We girls must take good care of our hands. After all, our hands are our second face! Let this kid peel it for us.”As she said that, old Mrs. Cen pushed the box of lychees in front of Cen Shaoqing. Then, she ordered the servant to bring a new plate over.

......

How could ye Zhuo let Cen Shaoqing Peel Lychees for her? She hurriedly said, “No need, Grandma Cen. I can do it myself.”

“Let him Peel.”Old Mrs. Cen pressed down on Ye Zhuo’s hand. “What’s the big deal about him peeling lychees with his rough skin and thick flesh?”

This brat was too insensible!

Seeing ye Zao here, he didn’t even know how to show his hospitality!

With his stiff appearance, if he didn’t have a good grandmother like her in China, he probably wouldn’t have found a wife for the rest of his life!

Zhou xiang immediately echoed, “Right, right, right. Zao Zao, you mustn’t be polite to this brat! How can we girls Peel Lychees with our own hands? We should let a man with thick skin do it!”

The thick-skinned Cen Shaoqing:”...”

Biological Mother? Biological grandmother?

The servant quickly brought a clean plate. Cen Shaoqing had no choice but to put the Buddha beads aside and accept his fate and pick up a lychee.

It was like an emotionless peeling machine.

Very quickly, a plate of crystal clear lychees was peeled.

Thanks to Ye Zhuolao, this was the first time Zhou Xiang had eaten lychees peeled by Cen Shaoqing in his lifetime.

Not to mention Zhou Xiang.

It was even the first time for Old Lady Cen.

Cen’s eyes flashed with shrewdness.

She knew that Cen Shaoqing would definitely be charmed by Ye Zao.

If Cen Shaoqing had not taken a fancy to ye Zao.

With Cen Shaoqing’s character, how could he sit there and obediently peel the lychee?

He would have left long ago!

After peeling the lychee, Cen Shaoqing got up and went to the bathroom to wash his hands.

Old Mrs. Cen immediately followed him.

When Cen Shaoqing came out of the bathroom, he saw Old Mrs. Cen waiting for him at the door.

“Grandma, What’s the matter?”

Old Mrs. Cen nodded.

Cen Shaoqing leisurely stuck his hand in with a tissue. “Go ahead.”

“What do you think of Yezi?”Old Mrs. Cen asked.

“Very good.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

Old Mrs. Cen’s eyes lit up. “You admit that you like Yezi!”

“I just said that she’s very good, but I didn’t say that I like her.”CEN Shaoqing continued, “To tell you the truth, I’ve known her for a long time. It’s just that I didn’t know that she was the miracle doctor who cured you.”

A gossipy look immediately flashed across old Mrs. Cen’s eyes. “So the two of you have been secretly dating for a long time!” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“We’re just ordinary friends.”Cen Shaoqing’s tone was indifferent.

Old Mrs. Cen said speechlessly, “Yezi is so outstanding, so beautiful, and she speaks beautifully. It’s not embarrassing for you to like her! What’s there to be afraid of admitting? If you like her, then go and chase her! If you can’t get her, then your grandmother will help you! What are you afraid of?”

“I only admire her. There’s not the slightest bit of love between a man and a woman.”Cen Shaoqing took out a Buddhist bead from his pocket. “Grandmother, don’t randomly pick a couple.”

“You’ve already admitted that you admire her! And you still insist that you don’t like her?”Old Mrs. Cen said angrily, “You’re a sand sculpture! You’re not worthy to be my eldest grandson! You’re nothing!”

“Grandma, you’ve really misunderstood.”

Admiration was admiration.

Liking was liking.

The two seemed to be the same, but there was a big difference.

Cen Shaoqing had always been pure-hearted and abstinent. He had never had any other thoughts towards ye Zhuo.

Except for those indescribable dreams.

But they were just dreams. Dreams were subconscious and could not be controlled.
