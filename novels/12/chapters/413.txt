“Chapter 414: 119: Mu Yourong is in jail, Li Qiandong is repenting, and fifth master is pursuing his wife! 3”

Translator: 549690339

“Since God knows when, Cen Shaoqing’s car refrigerator has been filled with all kinds of desserts. ”

Maybe...

Even Cen Shaoqing himself didn’t realize it.

On the other side.

“After hanging up the phone, the head of the planning department was stunned. ”

“When the group was talking about the CEO’s wife, he didn’t believe it and thought it was just a rumor. ”

He did not expect it to be true.

“From her voice, the future CEO’s wife’s voice was quite pleasant to hear. ”

She was definitely prettier!

The head of the planning department wanted to post what he had just experienced in the group.

“As soon as he opened the group, he closed the chat page again. ”

He was a head after all. He had to take the lead. What was the point of gossiping about the boss in the group?

“Cen Shaoqing first sent ye Zhuo home, then he would go to the CEN residence. ”

“On the other side, because Mu Yourong was already pregnant, she could not be sentenced to death. During the first trial, under the circumstances where the evidence was conclusive, she was sentenced to life imprisonment, suspended for a year. ”

“Although she was not immediately sentenced to life imprisonment, Mu Yourong’s movements were already restricted, and her daily life was also under the supervision of the police. ”

She had already completely lost her freedom.

“Mu Yourong sat in her room and looked out the window at the sky, her eyes filled with unwillingness. ”

Why? FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Why did ye Zao get better after leaving the MU family, but she had become so miserable! ”

Fortunately.

“Fortunately, there was still song Shiyu. ”

Song Shiyu definitely would not let ye Zao off.

“Thinking of her own experiences in her previous life, the depression in Mu Yourong’s heart finally lessened a little. ”

“In the blink of an eye, another few days passed. ”

He ziteng had been learning a lot about racing by ye Zao’s side these past few days.

“Today, as usual, he was preparing to look for ye Zao. ”

“At the entrance of the unit building in the Ye family estate, he saw ye Zao and song Shiyu standing together, chatting and laughing. They seemed to be very familiar with each other. In the end, she even got into song Shiyu’s car. ”

He Ziteng knew a little about song Shiyu.

“Seeing this scene, he ziteng was alarmed! ”

Not Good!

Fifth Brother had met a love rival.

He ziteng immediately drove to the CEN Group and ran all the way to the top floor.

“Cen Shaoqing was sitting in front of his office desk, reading a document. ”

He ziteng adjusted his breathing and gently knocked on the office door. “Fifth brother.”

Cen Shaoqing looked up slightly. “Come in.”

“He ziteng walked in and sat on the chair in front of the office desk. He was carefully choosing his words in his mind. “Fifth brother, do you like my idol?” ”

Hearing that.

“Cen Shaoqing was stunned and was about to say something when he ziteng directly interrupted Cen Shaoqing’s words, “Fifth brother, don’t deny it, and don’t say that you don’t want to get married! I can see from your eyes that you’ve long been conquered by my idol! Let me tell you, you’re in trouble now!” ”

“What trouble?”Cen Shaoqing raised his eyebrows slightly.

“He ziteng said very seriously, “Fifth brother! You’ve Met Your Love Rival!” ”

“Cen Shaoqing was silent, and his thin lips pursed tightly. ”

Song Shiyu’s facial features suddenly appeared in front of his eyes.

“And the person that ye Zhuo said was on par with him in chess should also be song Shiyu, right? ”

“Thinking of Song Shiyu, Cen Shaoqing’s deep eyes flashed with a ruthless light. ”

“Seeing Cen Shaoqing like this, he ziteng was so scared that he shivered. ”

Why did he look at Cen Shaoqing with a somewhat scary gaze?

He ziteng swallowed his throat and continued to say:

“”Fifth brother, you know song Shiyu, the head of the song family, right? It’s him! I just saw that my idol seemed to be quite familiar with him. Moreover, I feel that the way song Shiyu looks at my idol is also not quite right! Fifth brother, if you like my idol, then don’t hold back your words! Hurry up and chase after her! Don’t let song Shiyu get the upper hand when the time comes! After all, my idol is so outstanding!” ”

It really was song Shiyu!

It seemed that song Shiyu really had an ulterior motive for ye Zao.

“Otherwise, song Shiyu would not be so kind as to arrange a few people to close in to protect ye Zao. ”

Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly.

PA —

He broke the pen in his hand just like that.

He ziteng was shocked.

Cen Shaoqing was...

Jealous?

It was really like adding salt to the water and adding tofu to the pot.

“Before he met ye Zao, he ziteng thought Cen Shaoqing would be a bachelor for the rest of his life. ”

“After all, Cen Shaoqing had always claimed that he would never marry. ”

That was because he felt that there was no point in getting married and having children.

He did not expect that.

He did not expect that this person would also be jealous at times.

“He ziteng was inexplicably gloating, “Fifth brother, I’ve already told you what I should say. You should seize the opportunity! You’re acting like nothing has happened. When song Shiyu gets my idol, just don’t regret it.” ”
