Translator: 549690339

“Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded.

“”If he dares to bully you, just tell me. I’ll help you beat him up!”Man Wen looked at Bai Jingshu. ”

“Don’t just focus on talking about me. What About You?”Bai Jingshu continued to ask.

“”Me? I’m still the same!”Man Wen smiled and said, “When I meet someone I like, I’ll definitely tell you immediately.” ”

“”Oh right, Man Wen, I met Miss Ye on Earth,”Bai Jingshu said. ”

“When he heard the words ‘Miss Ye’, Man Wen’s expression clearly paused. “Is She Alright?” ”

“”She’s fine,”Bai Jingshu continued. “Ye Han and Shi Qingcheng are also here. I feel that Miss Ye should be happier on Earth than in the S Galaxy.” ”

“”As long as she’s fine.”Man Wen rarely confided in others, and Bai Jingshu was one of them. “I hope that she’ll always be happy and not be held back by the secular world. Oh right, how does Mr. Cen Treat Her?” ”

“”Mr. Cen seems to really dote on Miss Ye. The two of them are very compatible together. By the way, I heard that after Miss Ye graduates from university, they will officially prepare for their wedding.” ”

Manwen’s lips curled up into a smile. “She has experienced all the hardships in the first half of her life. It’s time for her to experience happiness in the second half of her life.”

“”Mm.”Bai Jingshu nodded. “Actually, I’ve always admired your eldest sister. I hope to be like your eldest sister and be a free and easy person. I like what I like, and I love what I love.” ”

“There was a popular saying on the internet: “If you let the Noise Go, you’ll be on your own. I’m very amorous, and I don’t compete with the world.”. ”

Bai Jingshu liked this saying very much.

She felt that ye Zhuo was a good example of the true meaning of this saying.

“If ye Zhuo cared about what others thought of him, he wouldn’t have achieved what he did today. ”

“You’re not bad yourself.”Man Wen looked at Bai Jingshu. “I feel that you and her personality are quite similar sometimes.”

“For the sake of what she loved, she could be dismissive. ”

“My Pleasure.”Bai Jingshu took a sip of her wine.

“Man Wen also took a sip of his wine and continued, “By the way, I heard that your family has arranged a blind date for you recently, right?” ”

“Yes.”Bai Jingshu was a little annoyed at the mention of this.

There was more or less the same reason why she considered accepting Chen Yaosheng.

“As long as she had a boyfriend, her parents would not think about such nonsense anymore. ”

“Man Wen smiled and said, “If you need help, just let me know. Don’t be shy to ask. Aren’t friends supposed to help each other?” ”

“Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded.

Bai Mo followed Bai Jingshu all the way to their secret base.

“When he saw the two of them sitting together and talking about everything, it would be a lie to say that he did not feel anything at all. ”

“She had just received Chen Yaosheng’s message saying that Bai Jingshu was already moved by his strategy, but what was Bai Jingshu doing now? ”

Two-timing her?

She was not serious at all!

Bai Mo wanted to grit her teeth. It seemed like she still had to make Chen Yaosheng work harder. She had to win Bai Jingshu over so that Bai Jingshu would not be able to continue being a demon.

Man Wen and Bai Jingshu chatted for a long time before the two of them stood up and left.

“Seeing the two of them leave, Bai Mo immediately stood up and walked to the other side. ” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Man Wen and Bai Jingshu chatted as they walked. The two of them were good friends who shared similar interests. The more they talked, the more topics they talked about. ”

“”Man Wen, actually, I think you can find a girlfriend too. What Type Do you like? I’ll keep an eye out for you.” ”

“Manwen said, “I haven’t even sorted out my own matters yet. How can I be in the mood for a relationship?” ”

“He had just taken over Manxing Kingdom and was still in the process of getting used to the officials under him. He had to do a lot of things by himself, so he really didn’t have the mood to think about the love between children. ”

“”Then when you want a girlfriend, just let me know,”Bai Jingshu said. ”

“Okay.”Man Wen nodded. “Then remember to introduce me to a better-looking one.”

“No problem.”

“”Sis!”At this moment, a surprised voice suddenly sounded in the air. ”

Bai Jingshu looked up and saw that it was Bai Mo..

“”Momo,”Bai Jingshu said. ”

“”SIS, why are you here?”Bai Mo walked over and asked warmly. ”

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “I’m out for a walk.” ”

“Bai Mo pretended not to know man Wen and continued, “Sis, is this your boyfriend?”She said this on purpose. She wanted to see what Bai Jingshu would say! Moreover, she was doing this to attract man Wen’s attention. After all, Man Wen was the president of Manxing Country. In the s galaxy, there were very few people who did not know man Wen. If she recognized man Wen directly.., wouldn’t she be no different from other common people? She had to be different from others in order to attract Manwen’s attention. ”
