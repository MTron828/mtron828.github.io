“At this point, mother he held Xu Yao’s hand. “Yaoyao, let’s wait for a miracle together!” ”

“Xu Yao was very anxious. Just as she was about to say something, she looked up and saw Mi Chen’s eyes. ”

“Although Mi Chen didn’t say anything and only gave her a look, she still understood the meaning in Mi Chen’s eyes and found her backbone in an instant, she then said, “Alright then. Since uncle and uncle have already decided, I’ll respect your wishes!” ”

The He family’s parents nodded and turned around to walk into the ward.

“Xu Yao said, “Uncle and Auntie, I’ll go out to relax.” ”

“”En, you should go. You’ve worked hard during this period of time,”mother he said. ”

Xu Yao walked out.

Mi Chen was waiting at the corner.

“Why didn’t you stop this?”Xu Yao looked at Mi Chen and asked.

“Mi Chen’s lips curled into a smile. “Don’t worry, Ye Zao won’t be able to cure he ziteng.” ”

“”Are you that sure?”Xu Yao continued, “What if he’s cured? Do you know who ye Zao is? She’s the number one person on the aircraft carrier!” ”

A person who could go down in history!

He ziteng was also lucky to know ye Zao.

“Upon hearing this, Mi Chen said with disdain, “Even if she’s a god, she can’t cure he ziteng!” ”

“What do you mean?”Xu Yao looked at Mi Chen.

“Mi Chen continued, “Yaoyao, to tell you the truth, not only did I cause a car accident, I also poisoned he ziteng’s body! In less than a month, he ziteng will die from sudden death!” ”

“As long as he ziteng was alive, he was a threat to him. ”

“Therefore, Mi Chen decided not to do anything and just used the poison! ”

“What! Are You Crazy!”Xu Yao was shocked. “What if someone finds out that he ziteng was poisoned?”

“Mi chen smiled and said, “If they could find out, they wouldn’t have to wait until now. And that Ye Zhuo, didn’t she say that she was very powerful? When she checked his pulse, why didn’t she see that he ziteng was poisoned?” ”

“With that said, Xu Yao heaved a sigh of relief. ”

Mi Chen was right.

“If ye Zao was really that powerful, he should have been diagnosed. ”

This meant that ye Zao was just a facade.

“Mi Chen continued, “Don’t worry, nothing will happen. He Ziteng will definitely die! A person who is about to die will not be able to turn the sky upside down!” ”

Xu Yao nodded.

“In the ward, the He family’s parents handed the signed consent form to ye Zao. ”

“Ye Zao had already changed into a white lab coat. With a mask on, she could only see a pair of delicate phoenix eyes that were slightly raised. “Mr. and Mrs. He, is Xu Yao Pregnant?” ”

“”Yes.”Mother he nodded. “Miss Ye, you really have good eyesight. You can actually tell with one glance.” ”

“Ye Zao’s expression did not change. He continued, “Xu Yao and Mi Chen are not trustworthy people. Please be careful.” ”

“Hearing this, the He family’s parents were stunned. ”

“He ziteng, who was lying on the hospital bed, was very excited. ”

“As expected, Ye Zao was still ye Zao. ”

He could actually tell at a glance that Mi Chen and Xu Yao were not good people.

“However, the He family’s parents were somewhat suspicious. ”

After all.

They were the children of He ziteng. They would rather sever their relationship with their parents to give birth to the child. One of them had saved mother he’s life.

Could it be that... Ye Ziteng was mistaken.

“Father he quickly reacted and said with a smile, “Miss Ye, did you misunderstand something? Doctor Mi and Yaoyao are both very good children.” ”

Ye Ziteng’s expression did not change and his tone was light. “One must be wary of others.”

Father he nodded.

“At this moment, assistant Xiao Shen ran over and said, “Miss Ye, the operating theater is ready!” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

He ziteng was pushed into the operating theater.

The bright operating theater lit up.

The atmosphere gradually became tense.

The two anesthetists began to administer anesthetics to he ziteng.

Ye Zhuo slowly put on a pair of rubber gloves.

“He Ziteng’s consciousness went from clear-headed to blurry. In the end, he fell into a deep sleep. ”

“Outside the operating theater, the He family’s parents and Xu Yao were waiting outside. ”

“Xu Yao comforted them. “Uncle, Auntie, don’t be anxious. Ziteng will definitely be fine!” ”

They were not anxious.

How could they not be anxious at a time like this?

“In the blink of an eye, five hours had passed. ”

From 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. in the afternoon.

Mother he looked at the operating theater. “It’s already been five hours. Why is there still no movement at all?”

Xu Yao’s lips curled up without leaving a trace.

It was better to have a longer operating period.

A longer operating period meant that the situation was very troublesome.

“Some major surgeries can last more than ten hours. It’s only been five hours. Sit down first.”Father he pinched his temple. “Sit down first. You’re Shaking My Head!”
