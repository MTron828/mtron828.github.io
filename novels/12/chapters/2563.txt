Liu Meilian stood there with a pale face.

Little B * Tch!

This little B * Tch dared to lie to her!

“If she had known this would happen, she wouldn’t have stayed at home last night. ” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

But now.

1.

No.

She couldn’t take this lying down.

“Since Vivi had secretly gone abroad, she would look for a hospital. ”

Wasn’t it very easy for such a big hospital to casually take out tens of millions?

“Even if it was not tens of millions, there would still be millions! ”

“With this thought in mind, Liu Meilian came to the hospital hall and cried and yelled, “Without the consent of the Guardian, what right do you have to perform a discharge surgery on My Daughter? ! What right do you have? ! Give my daughter back!” ”

“She threw a tantrum and rolled on the floor, putting all the unpresentable things on the table. ”

It made people dumbfounded.

“In a place like the hospital, it was very normal for doctors to make a scene. When some busybodies saw this scene, they uploaded the video onto the Internet. ”

“When she saw that someone was filming it, Liu Meilian became even more enthusiastic, “My daughter is still underage!”! “What kind of hospital are you guys in... ?”. ... treating human lives like grass ! Although I’m just an insignificant commoner, I also have human rights ! Where did you hide my daughter ! All of you here are human traffickers. Heavens, is there still justice in this world? !” ”

“After this video was posted on the Internet, it immediately received hundreds of thousands of views and views. ”

The modern people’s outlook on the world was very normal.

“When they saw such a thing, of course, they had to stand up, but what they saw was too one-sided. ”

“If one’s willpower was slightly weak, some netizens would be led astray. ”

It would cause a huge uproar.

[ oh my God! are all the hospitals nowadays so scary? ]

[ I heard that the daughter of the human affairs department is still underage. ]

“[@first People’s Hospital of Beijing, please give us a reasonable explanation. ] ”

“[ it is not that there is no darkness in this world, but that we do not see darkness. The reality is far more serious than what we see. ] ”

“[ is the threshold for creating rumors so low now? Before the cause and effect of the incident is revealed, everyone should be careful with their words and actions! Good words warm the heart for three winters, and evil words hurt the heart for six months of cold. ] ”

“[@capital’s number one people’s Hospital,@number one news site,@capital city report. is official Weibo going to play dead again at this time? ] ”

“[ what else can we do if we don’t Play Dead? Since ancient times, the poor can’t win against the rich, and the people can’t win against the officials! ] ”

[ let’s unite and give this mother an explanation. ]

“[ I’m also a mother. Seeing this video, My Heart Really Hurts! ] ”

“Unity is strength!”

“...”

“The public opinion was getting bigger and bigger, like a snowball rolling in the snow. ”

“If they didn’t clear the clouds and see the sun, they would eventually cause an avalanche. ”

The hospital also had a headache.

They were most afraid of unruly people like Liu Meilian.

“”Director Han, what should we do now?”The assistant showed the tablet to director Han. “Many patients in the hospital are protesting now.” ”

Director Han also had a headache.

He didn’t know how to explain.

“At that moment, there was a knock on the door. ”

The assistant immediately went to open the door.

“Director Han.”

“”Little Zhao is here,”director Han said. ”

Little Zhao handed director Han a USB drive. “Miss ye asked me to give this to you.”

“Director Han reached out to take it and asked curiously, “What’s This?” ”

“Little Zhao shook her head. “I’m not sure either, but you’ll know once you open it and take a look.” ”

“Okay.”

“Director Han inserted the USB drive into the computer. When she opened it, she found that it was a edited video. ”

The background of the video was Wei Wei’s operating room that day.

The conversation between Liu Meilian and Xiang Chao could be clearly heard in the video.

“How will the inheritance be divided if she dies?”

“”Doesn’t she still have 300,000? I have 250,000, and you have 50,000!” ”

“On what basis!”

“”On the basis that Wei Wei was brought up by my mother all these years. Other than giving birth to her, what else did you do?” ”

“I don’t agree!”

The two of them argued in the operating theater until their faces turned red.

“Director Han’s expression instantly turned bright. “Miss Ye, this video came at the Right Time!” ”

“After saying that, director Han continued, “Little Wang, upload the video to the Internet. Explain to the netizens what you need to explain!” ”

Little Wang nodded. “Alright.”

Little Wang immediately uploaded the video.

“Very soon, the first hospital made an explanation. ”

“[ regarding this matter, our hospital has already made an investigation. First, although the lady in the video is the mother of the patient, Xiang Wei, she is not her guardian. Xiang Wei came to the hospital alone for an in-patient surgery when she was seriously ill. Now, she has the right to leave the hospital alone. Not all parents can be called parents. In addition, Xiang Wei is doing very well now. Please don’t worry about her. ] ”
