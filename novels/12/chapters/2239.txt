“Noticing the change in Chen Yaosheng’s expression, Bai Mo said again, “Mr. Chen should know the principle of loving the house and the Crow, right?” ”

“If he wanted to successfully pursue Bai Jingshu, he had to like what Bai Jingshu liked. ”

Chen Yaosheng frowned. Could it be that Bai Mo wanted him to directly pursue her to Earth for Bai Jingshu’s sake?

How was this possible? !

“It was as if he could read Chen Yaosheng’s mind, he smiled and said, “How is this impossible? You can at least chase after Sister Jingshu with this method. Once you have her, won’t you be able to do whatever you want then?” His last sentence was very tempting. No man could resist such temptation. ”

“Can you really chase after your sister like this?”Chen Yaosheng asked incredulously.

“Bai Mo smiled and said, “If you don’t do anything, then there’s even less hope. Mr. Chen, a man must be flexible.” ”

“What Miss Bai said makes sense.”Chen Yaosheng nodded.

“If he didn’t even try, then he really wouldn’t have a chance. ”

“Bai Mo handed Chen Yaosheng a document bag. “Mr. Chen, I wish you success.” ”

“Thank you.”Chen Yaosheng took the document bag.

“After Chen Yaosheng left, Bai Yuanyuan asked curiously, “Mo Mo, Can Chen Yaosheng really catch up to Bai Jingshu?” ”

“”I think so.”Bai Jingshu was just a newbie in love. As long as Chen Yaosheng handled it well, he would definitely be able to catch her. “Don’t worry, we’ll just wait and watch the show.” ”

“Okay.”Bai Yuanyuan nodded.

“After receiving Bai Mo’s guidance, Chen Yaosheng rejected all the matters at hand and rode the interstellar shuttle to Earth. ”

“In the interstellar shuttle, Chen Yaosheng opened the file and realized that this file recorded Bai Jingshu’s daily interests and hobbies, as well as her address on earth and the places she often liked to visit... ... Very carefully. ”

“Looking at the file, Chen Yaosheng was full of fighting spirit. ”

He would definitely be able to successfully woo Bai Jingshu.

...

The library.

Bai Jingshu often came to the library to borrow books.

“Because some books were already out of print, other than the ones that could be borrowed from the library, they could not be bought or borrowed from other places. ”

“For example, this was a true record of the Yuan dynasty. ”

“It was said that a member had kept this book for himself, so in order to let more people see the local customs of the Yuan dynasty, he put it in the library for people to read. ”

“Bai Jingshu waited in line for a long time, but only managed to borrow it for two days. ”

“As she flipped through it, Bai Jingshu realized that the original owner really cherished this book. He made a lot of notes beside it, but he was afraid of damaging the book, so he wrote it on a note. ”

“From the lines, Bai Jingshu could tell that the owner of the book also loved history and culture very much. ”

Looking for a good friend.

It had been a long time since Bai Jingshu had seen someone who loved history so much.

It felt like Boya had met Zhong Ziqi.

“Unfortunately, the book could only be read for two days. ”

“On the third day, Bai Jingshu returned the book to the library on time. ”

This scene was witnessed by Chen Yaosheng.

“To Chen Yaosheng, it was not difficult for him to steal a book from the library. ”

“The next day, Chen Yaosheng appeared in front of Bai Jingshu with a gift box in his hand. ”

“Bai Jingshu did not have a good impression of Chen Yaosheng, but she still asked politely, “Mr. Chen, what’s the matter?”A person like Chen Yaosheng, who was famous in the s galaxy, should disdain coming to Earth. ”

“Chen yaosheng smiled and said, “I have a gift for you.” ” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“After saying that, he brought the book in front of Bai Jingshu. ”

“When she saw the book, Bai Jingshu was a little surprised. “This book is Yours?” ”

“Chen Yaosheng nodded. “Yes, just like you, I also like the ancient culture of Earth very much.” ”

“You want to give it to me?”Bai Jingshu asked.

“”Yes.”Chen yaosheng continued, “It’s difficult to find a good friend. Compared to me, you’re more suitable to be the owner of this book.” ”
