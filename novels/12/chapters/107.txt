Chapter 108: 077: setting people up to burn online, birthday banquet venue 1

Hearing Mu Yourong say this, soldier Mu’s eyes lit up.

Right!

After all, Mu Yourong used to be called ye yourong.

So, a big shot from the capital was definitely here to look for Mu Yourong to return the favor!

Thinking that their Mu family would soon be able to establish a relationship with a big shot, soldier Mu was very excited. He looked at mu yourong and said, “Yourong, tell father, who is that big shot?”

Even now, he knew that the person who had come to look for Mu Yourong was a big shot from the capital, but he did not know who that big shot was.

Mu yourong asked, “Father, do you know the Yang family of the capital?”

“Yang Family?”Big soldier Mu narrowed his eyes. “Could it be the Yang family of the LP Group?”

Mu Yourong shook her head.

Big Soldier Mu frowned. “It’s not LP?”

There were only two Yang families in the capital.

One was the Yang family that founded LP Group.

The other was the head of the ten great clans!

As for the other Yang families, they were not worth mentioning.

If it was not LP group’s head, Mu Yourong would not have saved the head of the ten great clans, the Yang family, right?

Thinking of this, big soldier Mu’s expression became fearful.

Mu Yourong saw through big soldier Mu’s thoughts and smiled. “Father, you guessed correctly. It’s that Yang Family!”

Soldier Mu swallowed his saliva. “It’s, it’s that Yang family, the head of the Ten Great Clans?” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Yes.”Mu Yourong nodded. “I saved Yang Zhenyuan, Old Master Yang!”

Hearing this.

Soldier Mu felt that his entire person was in a bad mood.

Yang Zhenyuan!

A legendary figure that only existed by word of mouth!

The old master’s position in the capital was only second to Cen Wuye.

With the Mu family’s current strength, even the LP Yang family could not compare, let alone the Yang family, the head of the ten great families.

Soldier Mu was so excited that he could not say a word for a long time.

That was the Yang family!

His daughter was too capable!

She actually became Old Master Yang’s Savior!

As expected of the Mu family’s bloodline!

If it was that trash ye Zhuo.

Would she be able to do it?

Seeing soldier mu like this, Mu yourong smiled and said, “Father! This is too exaggerated. I only saved Old Master Yang, and you are already so excited. If I were to marry Fifth Master Cen in the future, wouldn’t you be scared to death?”

Compared to fifth master cen...

The Yang family was still far from it!

Only then did soldier Mu come to his senses and hold Mu Yourong’s hand. “Yourong, tell me, what exactly is going on? Everything is fine, but how did you save Old Master Yang?”

Great Soldier Mu’s greatest fear was that it would all be for nothing.

He still had to clarify things a little.

Mu Yourong also knew great soldier Mu’s worries, “A year ago, old master Yang suffered from a serious illness. There was no medicine to cure him, and he was diagnosed with death by the hospital. “Father, you know my ability. I gave Old Master Yang a medicinal pill left behind by the Divine Doctor Hua Tuo. Old Master Yang only recovered after taking my medicine.”

Since it was a death syndrome, could a normal doctor cure it?

Now that grandfather Yang had come to the capital to look for his savior, who else could it be other than her?

After understanding the cause and effect of the matter, soldier Mu felt much more at ease. His eyes were filled with excitement, he looked at mu yourong and said, “Yourong, our family’s company is currently at a critical moment. If we can obtain the help of the Yang family, we will definitely be able to win the bid for CY company in the capital...”

Cy Company’s cooperation proposal was a big piece of meat.

There were simply too many companies that wanted to win the bid.

The Mu family was just an unremarkable small company among the many companies that had submitted bids.

If they wanted to win the cooperation proposal, they did not even have a 0.01% chance.

Mu Yourong patted soldier Mu’s hand. “Father, I understand everything you’re saying. Don’t worry, I’m now Old Master Yang’s Savior. Even if I don’t say it, they will know what to do.”

The Yang family relied entirely on old master yang to support them.

Therefore, the current her to the Yang family was not as simple as old master Yang’s Savior.

If it wasn’t for her, the entire Yang family would have fallen.

Therefore, she was now equivalent to the entire Yang family’s savior.

Not to mention a collaboration, even if she wanted the stars in the sky, the MU family would have to think of a way to take them down.

A bright light flashed through Mu Yourong’s eyes, and the corners of her lips curled up.

Soldier Mu looked at Mu Yourong. “Yourong, your two older brothers are inferior to you. In the future, our MU family will rely on you.”

When Mu Yourong married Cen Fifth Master in the future...

There would be even greater glory waiting for the Mu family.

In the past, soldier Mu had been somewhat worried that Mu Yourong would be able to marry Cen fifth master as she wished.
