Translator: 549690339

“”Haifeng’s mother, thank you, thank you for not rejecting us.”The third aunt held Granny Cen’s hand tightly, her voice close to choking.”

“Granny Cen smiled and patted the third aunt’s shoulder, “His third aunt, life has its ups and downs. It will be fine once we get over this hurdle! Didn’t spongebob say that today’s unhappiness will end here? Tomorrow will still be shining brightly, baby!”At the end of her speech, old Mrs. Cen even imitated spongebob’s voice. It was vivid and lifelike.”

The third aunt broke into a smile. “You! You’re still the same as when you were young!”

“This is called not aging at all!”Old Mrs. Cen said.

“In the evening, Ye Zhuo stayed at the Cen residence for dinner.”

“After dinner, Old Mrs. Cen personally brought the third aunt and Xiaotian to the guest room. Considering that the old lady didn’t know how to use the bathroom and other electrical appliances in the guest room,. Old Mrs. Cen then taught her step by step, “Her third aunt. This is the bathroom. It’s where you take a bath and wash your face. This is the toilet...””

“”If you need anything, just pick up this microphone and press this button. It’s the button that has a small person drawn on it. Just tell them and they will bring it up.””

“”Okay, sorry to trouble you guys!”The third aunt was very embarrassed.”

“”It’s okay, it’s okay. We’re all on the same side.”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “By the way, these are the pajamas I prepared for you guys, as well as a change of clothes! “I still say the same thing. Since You’ve come to my place, you and Little Tianshun should treat this place as your own home. If you guys are so polite to me, I will definitely be angry! “Don’t say thank you either. With our relationship, saying thank you would be too distant!””

The third aunt swallowed her ‘thank you’and held onto Old Lady Cen’s words tightly. She remained silent and did not say anything.

“After chatting with the third aunt for a while, Old Lady Cen came downstairs.”

Ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing were sitting on the sofa watching television.

Old Lady Cen walked over and sighed. “Your third grandmother is really too pitiful! She has taken up all the hardships of life by herself.”

Ye Zhuo frowned slightly. “What’s wrong with third grandmother?”

Old Mrs. Cen then explained what had happened to third aunt.

“Hearing this, Ye Zhuo sighed. “Then let’s treat third grandmother better! It’s not easy for the old lady, and Little Tianshun is still so young. If we can help more, we can help more!””

“Old Mrs. Cen nodded. “Yezi, you’re thinking the same thing as me! We’re really not a family. We don’t enter the same house!””

“After saying that, old Mrs. Cen continued, “By the way, Shaoqing, are you going to your little aunt’s house tomorrow?””

The little aunt’s name was baizhi. She was old Mrs. Cen’s biological sister and was not far from Bai Shu’s place.

Cen Shaoqing nodded. “Yes.”

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Help me pass a message to her. Tell her to take good care of herself. After the guests leave, I’ll go to south city to see her.””

Cen Shaoqing raised his eyebrows in surprise. He did not think that this was what old Mrs. Cen had said.

“Old Mrs. Cen had some conflicts with Baizhi in the early years. The two of them had not been in contact for more than ten years. However, both of them had strange temperaments. If you don’t talk to me, I Won’t talk to you.”

“Old Mrs. Cen sighed. “After meeting your third grandmother today, I’ve realized that this life is nothing! “I don’t need to compete with anyone. No one knows who will arrive first tomorrow or by accident. I’m your aunt’s elder sister. All these years, it’s all my fault. As an elder sister, I should give in to my younger sister! “This sister only has one life. How can there be an afterlife? “We’re all so old. Who knows when we’ll leave one day!””

“Thinking back on this life, it felt like a dream.”

Some things seemed to have just happened yesterday.

“Cen Shaoqing smiled and said, “I’m relieved that you can think this through.””

Old Mrs. Cen nodded. “Take care of your safety on the road tomorrow. Have you arranged everything for the chauffeur over there?”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

...

“In the blink of an eye, it was the next morning.”

Cen Shaoqing arrived at the Lin family manor on time at six o’clock and had breakfast with the Lin family.

“Looking at the pile of vegetables in front of Cen Shaoqing, Ye Shu could not help but say, “Shaoqing, how can you eat vegetables all the time! Come, have some Bacon and ham!””

“”Thank you, Auntie.”Cen Shaoqing thanked her politely.”

Ye Zhuo casually placed the egg yolk that he had taken a bite into Cen Shaoqing’s bowl. Cen Shaoqing did not mind and picked it up to eat.

“Lin Ze, who had been fed a stomach full of dog food:”...”when Cen Shaoqing was not around, ye Zhuo’s egg yolks were all taken by him! Although he did not like to eat egg yolks, now that the egg yolk had entered cen Shaoqing’s stomach, Lin Ze felt a little uncomfortable.”

He still could not figure out how an old man like Cen Shaoqing had managed to seduce such a beautiful girl like him?

“As he thought about it, Lin Ze recalled the time when he was three years old and was pressed into the swimming pool by Cen Shaoqing.”

Did Cen Shaoqing really not know how to be violent?

What if ye Zao could not beat him?

“Cen Shaoqing felt a headache when he felt the loving gaze of his future brother-in-law. Once again, he regretted that he did not place his brother-in-law on the altar that year.”

“As a proud son of heaven, this was the first time Cen Shaoqing felt like he was trapped in a cocoon...”

“Fortunately, Breakfast ended very quickly. At half past six, the two of them left the Lin family manor on time.”

“At eight o’clock, they arrived at the airport.”

“After a five-hour flight, the plane arrived at South city.”

“As soon as they got off the plane, Ye Zao felt the heat of south city and took off his coat.”

Cen Shaoqing took the coat and put it in his arms. He held ye Zao’s hand with his other hand. “Let’s go this way.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly and followed Cen Shaoqing’s footsteps.

The driver was waiting at the airport.

“Master Five.”

“Seeing Cen Shaoqing with a female companion, the driver was stunned. He had never seen master five with a female companion in the past. Why did he have a female companion this year? And she was so beautiful! Could she be a girlfriend?”

“Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly, handed the suitcase to the driver, and opened the car door for ye Zhuo.”

The driver was even more surprised.

Amazing.

Really Amazing.

Who Was this little girl?

Why did he see a hint of fawning on master five?

He really did not expect that there was actually someone in this world that master five needed to fawn over.

“The driver got into the car with a nervous and curious mood, so he was fed dog food for the entire journey.”

“Soon, the car arrived at Bai Shu’s house.”

Bai Shu looked at the time and greeted the juniors at home. “Shaoqing is coming with his girlfriend in a while! You guys better be careful! Did you hear that? Don’t be rude.”

“”Got it, Grandma.””

“Just as Bai Shu finished her instructions, the housekeeper brought Cen Shaoqing and ye Zao in. “Old Madam, fifth master and Miss Ye have arrived.””

Bai Shu smiled and went up to greet them. “Zao Zao.”

“At the same time, an unbelievable voice sounded in the air. “Ye Zao? !””
