“After sending Zhao Pingting off, Ye Zhuo received a wechat message as soon as he walked out of the airport lobby. ”

It was from Zhao Xueyin.

[ are you free to have a meal together tomorrow? ]

“Ye Zhuo pondered for a moment before replying, [ sure. ] ”

“On the other end of the screen, Zhao Xueyin’s lips curled up. [ then let’s meet tomorrow at 11:30 a.m. at Hibiscus Moonlight Restaurant, shall we? ] ”

[ yes. ]

“Seeing Zhao Xueyin’s face full of joy, the lawyer asked, “How was it? Did Ye Zhuo agree?” ”

“”Yes.”Zhao xueyin nodded and continued, “Tell Little Zhang to prepare well.” ”

“”Don’t worry, I know.” ”

“Zhao Xueyin was still a little worried and continued, “Big Brother Si, can I trouble you to call Little Zhang over?” ”

“Sure.”Si lui nodded.

On the other side.

Ye Zhuo sent an Lizi to the villa and went home.

“When she went back, Ye Langhua was watering the flowers in the yard. ”

“Grandma.”Ye Zhuo walked over and called out.

Ye Langhua turned her head slightly. “Zhuo Zhuo is back.”

“Mm.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Ye Langhua put down the kettle and continued, “Zhuo Zhuo, I have something to tell you. Do you have time?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zha followed ye Langhua’s footsteps. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

The grandfather and grandson arrived at the study on the second floor.

“Ye Langhua found a yellowed book on the bookshelf and handed it to Ye Zha. “Zha Zha, open it and have a look.” ”

Ye Zha flipped to the first page.

“At the bottom right of the first page, there was a beautiful line of line-by-line book written on the back of the paper! ”

How could it be perfect? I just want to have a clear conscience.

“From this, it could be seen that the owner of the book was also a straightforward person with a clear conscience. ”

“Ye Zhuo flipped to another page, and on the second page, there was a photo. ”

“The old man in the photo had already turned white, and in his arms was a girl with two braids. ”

“Ye Langhua slowly opened her mouth, “The person in the photo is my father, also known as your great-grandfather. The Girl in his arms is your mother! “That day was your mother’s second birthday. Your mother was my only daughter and your grandfather liked her very much. He held her in his hands for fear that she would fall, so he kept her in his mouth for fear that she would melt... “Unfortunately, it’s hard to guard against thieves. No one would have thought that Xi Muwen, his biological father, would lay his hands on your mother “... “...” ”

Ye Langhua sank into painful memories again.

“”Your great-grandfather was a very strong man. He spent his whole life and effort to establish the Shunxi Financial Group. But his hard work was now taken by others! If he was still here, the Shunxi Financial Group wouldn’t have become like this... “... ...” ”

“At this point, ye Langhua slowly got to the main topic. She turned to look at ye Zhuo and said, “Zhuozhuo, if Grandma said that she wants you to become your grandfather’s successor and join the Shunxi Financial Group, would you agree to it?” ”

“Ye Zao raised his eyebrows and continued, “You said that other than Grandpa, the three founders of the Shunxi Financial Group are the Zhang family and the Zhao family, right?” ”

“”Yes.”Ye Langhua nodded, “Elder Zhang followed your great-grandfather all the way here. He is a trustworthy person!”! “Now, the Zhao family is the one who has a change of heart. Currently, the Zhao family is the sole leader of the Shunxi Financial Group. Not only does Zhao Zhendong want to drive the Zhang and ye families out of the financial group, but he also wants to promote to an aristocratic family!” ”

Ye Zhuo’s expression was indifferent.

“Ye langhua continued, “So, Zhuozhuo, can you promise Grandma?” ”

“If it was a week ago, Ye Zhuo would definitely reject ye Langhua without hesitation. After all, she was quite busy right now, and there was still the aerospace undertaking waiting for her to complete. ”

“But now, she wouldn’t. ”

“After all, some people were already impatient to find her. ”

Ye Zao was afraid of everything.

He was not afraid of trouble!

“”Okay, I promise you.”Ye Zao nodded slightly. ”

“Really?”Ye Langhua did not expect ye Zao to agree so quickly.

“Yes.”

“Ye Langhua held ye Zao’s hand excitedly. “Zao, Thank You! Thank you! I thank you on behalf of your great-grandfather! and thank you on behalf of elder Zhang!” ”

“Ye Zao continued, “But you have to give me a few days. I have other things to take care of.” ”

“”No Problem!”Ye langhua continued, “Take as much time as you want.” ”

“”Don’t worry, it won’t take too long.” ”

“After chatting with Ye Zao, Ye Langhua quickly told the good news to elder Zhang. ”

“When elder Zhang heard the news, he was also very happy. He immediately called Cao Feng, “Cao Feng! Zhuozhuo has agreed to join the Shunxi Consortium. Quickly arrange it. I want to arrange the grandest welcoming banquet for Zhuozhuo! Let everyone know that the descendants of the old ye family have returned!” ”
