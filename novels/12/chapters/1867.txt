Ye Zao nodded slightly and lay back on the chair.

Cen Shaoqing leaned slightly and gently pressed on her temple a few times. Ye Zao lost consciousness and fell into sleep.

“In a moment, CEN Shaoqing took out a box of something similar to sandalwood from the drawer on the table and lit it in the exquisite incense burner. ”

Green smoke curled up.

“In an instant, a faint fragrance lingered in the air, making people feel relaxed and especially pleasant. ”

“Ten minutes later, ye Zao woke up again. Cen Shaoqing was sitting next to her, his thin lips slightly opened. “You still didn’t see anything this time?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Cen Shaoqing frowned. Logically speaking, with the effect of the incense, ye Zao shouldn’t still have not seen anything. ”

What was going on?

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Give me your hand.” ”

Ye Zao stretched out his hand.

Cen Shaoqing stretched out his hand and placed it on ye Zao’s pulse. He was slightly focused.

“Seeing how he looked like, Ye Zao smiled and said, “You know how to take my pulse?” ”

“”I know a little about it.”Cen Shaoqing did not know Chinese medicine, but he knew hypnosis. The success or failure of hypnosis was also inextricably linked to the pulse. ”

“About three minutes later, Cen Shaoqing let go of Ye Zao’s hand. ”

“What happened?”Ye Zao asked.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “You’ve been too tired recently. You need to rest well. Sometimes, if you focus too much, it will affect the results of hypnosis.” ”

Ye Zao narrowed his eyes. “Then what should we do now?”

“”Wait a little longer.”Cen Shaoqing looked at ye Zao and said, “Don’t keep thinking about this during this period of time. Let nature take its course.” ”

Ye Zao was naturally anxious because he had not been able to recover his chaotic memories.

“However, being anxious now was not a solution. ”

He could only divert his attention to other places.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Haven’t you always wanted to go to the prairie to play? Make some time and let’s go to the prairie.” ”

“Ever since he met Li Yueyue, ye Zao had said that he wanted to go to the prairie to play with Cen Shaoqing. ”

“Unfortunately, he didn’t have much time, so this plan had been put on hold until now. ”

“Hearing this, Ye Zhuo’s eyes lit up. “Are you free now?” ”

“”I’m not a big deal,”Cen Shaoqing said. “What About You?” ”

What was more important than spending time with his wife?

“As long as ye Zhuo wanted to go, he could accompany him at any time. ”

“Ye Zhuo thought for a moment and then said, “Then I’ll make the arrangements. Wait for my notice. It should be in the next few days.” ”

The Great Prairie in winter was more romantic than in summer.

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “I’ll listen to your arrangements.”

The two of them talked as they left the house.

“When they came downstairs, old Mrs. Cen said, “Yezi, Shaoqing, aren’t you guys having lunch at home? I’ve already asked the kitchen to cook.” ”

“”No thanks, Grandma Cen. There are still some things to deal with in the base.”Ye Zhuo turned to look at Old Mrs. Cen. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen said, “Since you have things to do, I won’t keep you.” ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “We’ll come back to have dinner with you tonight.” ”

“Hearing this, Old Mrs. Cen said in surprise, “Really?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded.

“”Then it’s settled then, Yezi. I’ll wait for you guys to come back for dinner tonight.” ”

Zhou Xiang had not been home during this period of time.

“Old Mrs. Cen was too bored to eat alone. When she heard that ye Zhuo had come back to eat with her, the old lady was very happy. She repeatedly reminded them, “You guys must come back tonight!” ”

“”Yes, I’ll definitely come back to eat with you,”ye Zhuo said. ”

...

On the other side.

He ziteng had been quite busy recently.

He had not contacted Xu Yao for a week.

Xu Yao could not sit still.

She suspected that he ziteng had a new lover.

“Before this, he ziteng would send her messages almost every day. ”

“Good morning, good afternoon, good night. ”

He even arranged for the chef to send her food. It was very thoughtful.

“It caused Xu Yao’s close friends to be endlessly envious, and they all sighed with admiration at Xu Yao’s good fortune. ”

That was he ziteng. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

There really wasn’t a girl that caused he ziteng to be so worried.

Xu Yao was the first.

“But now, he ziteng suddenly disappeared, and it caused Xu Yao to be slightly flustered. ”

Those close friends by her side were already unable to restrain themselves from wanting to watch the show.

What should she do now?

Should she take the initiative to contact he ziteng?

“If she were to contact he ziteng, how would he ziteng view her? ”

No!

This was not possible.

“Just as Xu Yao was in a daze, Yang Zixuan walked over and said, “Yaoyao, why haven’t I seen the he family’s eldest young master come to pick you up recently?” ”

“Xu Yao smiled and said, “I haven’t considered whether I should accept him or not.” ”
