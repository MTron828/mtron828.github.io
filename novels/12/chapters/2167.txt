“I don’t care. I Won’t admit her!”Man Wen interrupted Zhao Dan.

“Zhao Dan frowned and said helplessly, “Wen er!” ”

“Go!”Man Wen stood up and pushed Zhao Dan out.

Zhao Dan had no choice but to turn and leave.

“When he reached the door, Zhao Dan turned to his assistant and ordered, “Block the young master’s starnet account during this period of time. Don’t allow him to spout nonsense on social media.” ”

“”Yes, Madam.”The assistant nodded. ”

Inside the room.

“In the blink of an eye, Man Wen seemed to have changed into a different person. He came to the small room and contacted fan mu. “Have you found Auntie Man from back then?” ”

Fan Mu shook her head. “Not yet.”

“After saying that, fan mu continued to ask, “Are you sure you want to do this?” ”

“”Yes.”Man Wen nodded. “So, we must find Auntie Man and restore the truth of the incident back then.” ”

Only in this way could ye Zhuo get out of his current predicament.

“”They are your parents after all.”Fan Mu looked at man Wen. “Moreover, it won’t do you any harm to recognize your eldest sister back.” ”

“Once the truth of the incident was restored, how would man Jiangshan and Zhao Dan deal with themselves? ”

“Most importantly, in Ye Zhuo’s eyes, Man Wen was still a bad younger brother. ”

What man Wen did was not beneficial to himself.

“In Fan Mu’s opinion, Man Wen should not have interfered in such a thankless task. ”

“”Man Wen, why don’t you stay out of this matter? Once the truth is revealed, what will happen to your parents? How will they face the people of Manxing?” ”

“As the highest leader of Manxing, they had actually abandoned their daughter and left her to fend for herself. After knowing that their daughter had achieved success and fame, they wanted to acknowledge their daughter back. This was more or less disgusting. ”

“At that time, just the spittle could drown people. ”

“Man Wen narrowed his eyes slightly. “Since they can do such a thing, they should be able to bear the consequences!” ”

“Right now, he only wanted to restore the truth of the matter and clear ye Zhuo’s name. He did not want to think about anything else. ”

Regardless of whether ye Zhuo had misunderstood him or not.

“Fan Mu shook his head, he sighed and said, “Your parents’actions were indeed a little too extreme! Aren’t they forcing your eldest sister into a corner? By the way, what did your second sister say? According to her image as the Holy Mother of Mary, there shouldn’t be no reaction at all.” ”

“She is the biggest mastermind behind the scenes.”Man Wen hit the nail on the head.

“If it weren’t for man Xing’s encouragement, the situation wouldn’t have developed to this point. ”

Manxing was good at killing people without being noticed!

“”It’s not easy for your second sister to plan for so many years,”fan mu sighed. “But you’re quite ruthless, treating your biological parents like this...” ”

“Before he could finish his sentence, he was interrupted by Fan Mu. “Fan Mu! Cut the crap and go find Aunt Man. I want to get to the truth as soon as possible.” ”

“If the current situation continued to develop, it would definitely be disadvantageous to ye Zhuo! ”

It had to be resolved as soon as possible.

“Got it.”Fan Mu nodded.

“Man Xing also saw the statement that man Wen had made on the starnet. He frowned slightly and said, “It’s really not enough to do anything but ruin everything!” ”

“At such a critical time, to make such a statement, did man Wen not have a brain? ”

He really was a hopeless fool.

“Thinking of this, man Xing snorted coldly. ”

“Fortunately, Zhao Dan turned the tide and issued a statement in time, explaining the whole situation. ”

“”Yue’er, Wen ‘er was also in a moment of anger. Don’t be calculative with him. If you want to blame someone, blame mom. It’s mom who didn’t fulfill her responsibility as a mother and didn’t teach your brother well. “Mom was a very bad mother. Since she didn’t find you in time, let’s reunite as a family. Not only did she waste more than ten years of time, she also didn’t teach your brother well... “...”. “...” ”

“Zhao Dan gave a long speech and cried in front of the camera. From her appearance, she was definitely a good mother. ”

Her words were extremely harsh.

“The reason why man Wen became like this was because she had spent all these years looking for ye Zao. Because she was focused on looking for ye Zao, she didn’t have the time to educate man Wen. ”

“Zhao Dan claimed that she was to blame for not teaching the child well, but in reality, she had quietly pushed the blame onto ye Zao, making him the target of everyone’s criticism. ”

“However, in the blink of an eye, Ye Zao became the target of everyone’s attacks. ”

“After making the statement, Zhao Dan wiped the tears off her face and came to Manshan’s office. “I’ve already taken care of it. Don’t blame Wen ‘Er. No matter what, he’s still our son!” ”Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com
