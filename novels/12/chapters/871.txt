Translator: 549690339

“About five minutes later, Old Lady Cen suddenly stood up and said with a smile, “Look, my granddaughter-in-law is back.” ”

Old Lady Qi looked back and her expression changed slightly. “Miss Ye!”

“Old Lady Cen said in puzzlement, “You also know my granddaughter-in-law?” ”

The champion of the literary world assessment.

Who Didn’t know her?

“However, what Old Lady Qi didn’t expect was that ye Zhuo was actually old lady Cen’s granddaughter-in-law. ”

This was too much of a coincidence!

“Old Lady Qi suddenly couldn’t react in time and turned to look at Old Lady Cen. “Sister Tang, are you sure that Miss Ye is your granddaughter-in-law?” ”

Old Lady Cen’s face darkened and her boss was displeased. “Look at what you’re saying. Can I still mistake my granddaughter-in-law for someone else?”

“Old Qi gulped and confirmed again, “Is it that little girl in the white shirt?” ”

“”Yes.”Old Mrs. Cen nodded and said proudly, “How is it? is my granddaughter-in-law outstanding?” ”

“At first, Old Qi did not believe that a young man could draw like that. ”

After seeing ye Zhuo.

He did not have any doubts.

Because ye Zao was not an ordinary young man to begin with.

Elder Qi smiled and nodded. “Excellent. Your granddaughter-in-law is simply too excellent.”

“”That’s right!”Old Mrs. Cen said with a proud face, “How can the granddaughter-in-law that I personally picked not be excellent?” ”

“At this moment, ye Zao walked to the side. Old Mrs. Cen held ye Zao’s hand and took the initiative to introduce, “Ye, this is elder Qi from the Chinese painting world. Little Qi, this is my future granddaughter-in-law, Ye Zao.” ”

“Ye Zhuo turned to look at elder qi and politely said, “Elder Qi.” ”

“”Miss Ye,”elder Qi said with a smile, “I’ve long heard of your name.” ”

Ye Zhuo smiled slightly. “You flatter me.”

“Before this, elder Qi had never interacted with Ye Zhuo. ”

“After a simple exchange, elder Qi admired this young man in front of him who was neither arrogant nor impatient. ”

“Elder Qi continued, “Sister Tang, I still have some matters to attend to. I need to go over for a while. Please forgive me if I haven’t treated you well.” ”

Old Madam Cen waved her hand. “You can go back to your work.”

“Elder qi cupped his hands towards old madam Cen. “Sister Tang, I’ll go over first then.” ”

Not long after.

The election had officially begun

Everyone put down their wine glasses and looked towards the stage.

Elder Qi stood on the stage. He first exchanged a few pleasantries before getting into the main topic. “I now announce that the next President of the Chinese Arts Association will be...”

“Liu Caiyi’s heart was about to jump out of her throat. Under everyone’s gaze, she slowly stood up from her chair. ”

Although elder Qi had yet to announce who that person was.

The result was already obvious.

“Other than her, who else had the ability to sit on the president’s seat? ”

“At this moment, elder Qi’s gaze slowly landed on ye Zao and he continued, “Miss ye Zao!” ”

Ye Zao?

Ye Zao?

“When she heard this name, Liu Caiyi was immediately stunned. ”

She thought that she was hearing things. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

She should be the one who successfully promoted to president.

Why did it become ye Zao?

“Liu Caiyi’s face was deathly pale. She stood there, her legs trembling, embarrassed and embarrassed. ”

Why?

Why was this so?

How did ye Zao become the President?

Did she have real talent?

Everyone present was stunned.

“They all knew that Liu Caiyi was the next president. Liu Caiyi also stood up from her chair, but the final result was ye Zao. ”

Ye Zao?

Who Was Ye Zao?

“Ye Zao seems to be the girl who won first place in the literary world assessment not too long ago.”

“But I heard that she plagiarized...”

“I don’t know if she plagiarized or not. I heard that she’s very good-looking.”

“Why did elder Qi choose her to be the President?”

“Could it be because elder qi and master Yu are good friends?”

“F * ck! What are they doing! That’s the President of the Chinese Arts Association. Is it possible for anyone to be the president? Has Elder Qi lost his mind?”

“”This is a campaign for the president, not a beauty contest! Let Ye Zao be the President? Does ye Zao have the ability to do that?” ”

There was a flurry of discussion below the stage.

“In fact, Ye Zao was also a little confused. ”

“When she heard her name from elder Qi’s mouth, she thought that she had misheard. ”

She was just here to join in the fun. She did not expect to become the next president for no reason...

Was the president chosen so casually now?

“Just like ye Zao, Old Madam Cen also thought that she was hearing things. She turned to ye Zao and asked, “Ye, did Xiao Qi just say your name on the stage?” ”

“”I think so,”ye Zao continued, “But I’m not interested in the position of President.” ”

“At this moment, elder Qi walked down the stage and came in front of ye Zao. “Miss Ye Zao, would you like to be the next President of our Chinese Arts Association?” ”

“Ye Zao stood up and looked at elder Qi, tactfully rejecting him. “Thank you for your kindness, elder Qi...” ”

“Before she could finish her sentence, she was interrupted by an angry voice. ”

“Elder Qi! I disagree!”

Elder Qi turned around and saw that it was the second elder of the Chinese arts world who stood up.

The second elder thought highly of Liu Caiyi.

“The person who was originally decided to be Liu Caiyi was suddenly replaced, and it was a newcomer with a history of plagiarism. This was something that the second elder could not accept! ”

How could the Chinese arts world let a person with a history of plagiarism become the president?

Wasn’t this a joke?

“Second elder continued, “The position of president is very important. You didn’t even discuss it and handed such an important position to miss ye. Isn’t this too hasty?” ”

“Not only was it too hasty, it was also unfair to Liu Caiyi. ”

Liu Caiyi had relied on her own ability to climb up step by step.

What About Ye Zao?

On what basis did ye Zao have?

On the basis of plagiarism?

“When these words were said, someone immediately echoed, “I think second elder is right. This is indeed too rash!” ”

“It’s indeed very rash!”

“Seeing that so many people were standing up for her, Liu Caiyi felt much better. ”

Ye Zao could not be compared to her at all.

Elder qi frowned slightly.

“Seeing that so many people were supporting her, second elder felt much more confident, then he said, “Vice president Liu’s ability is something that we all have witnessed, and Miss ye only got first place in the literary world assessment. Moreover, that first place is still unclear!” ”

“Ye Zao did not have the intention to be the president, nor did he have the intention to participate in this dispute. However, when she heard this, she frowned slightly and looked up at second elder. “Please explain what is unclear.” ”

“Her tone was clear and shallow, but it was loud and clear, making people feel a chill in their hearts. ”

“”What doesn’t make sense? Don’t you know in Your Heart, Miss Ye?”Second Elder looked at ye Zhuo with contempt in his eyes. He hated people who plagiarized and cheated the most in his life. ”

He had admired Master Yu very much.

“However, he had never expected that master Yu would walk down a path of no return. ”

“Liu Caiyi stood up from her chair again. “If Miss Ye is open and aboveboard, why don’t we have a competition in front of everyone?” ”

“Hearing this, the crowd below the stage immediately echoed, “Yes, yes, yes! Let’s have a competition!” ”

“Only a competition is fair.”

Ye Zhuo stood up slightly and looked at Liu Caiyi. “What competition?”

“”This is the world of traditional Chinese painting. Of course, it’s a competition of painting. Why don’t we use the pastoral scenery as the theme to draw a painting?”Liu Caiyi replied. “I heard that miss ye is proficient in zither, chess, calligraphy, and painting. I wonder if Miss Ye dares to compete?” ”

“Why not?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly.

“Along the way, Ye Zhuo had seen quite a number of paintings hanging in the exhibition hall. ”

She had thought that her paintings were bad enough.

She did not expect that the paintings in the world of traditional Chinese painting were even worse than her paintings.

“From this, it could be seen that the world of traditional Chinese painting was only so-so! ”

“”Miss Ye, you have guts.”Liu Caiyi smiled, her eyes filled with ridicule. ”

“In terms of drawing, Liu Caiyi was a professional. ”

Did Ye Zhuo think that she could cheat this time?

Drawing was different from the assessment competition.

The assessment competition allowed one to know the answer in advance.

Drawing was not allowed!

Drawing depended on one’s true ability.

Ye Zhuo was just waiting to make a fool of himself!

“Thinking of this, Liu Caiyi felt extremely happy. ”

“Ye Zhuo turned to look at the second elder. “If vice president Liu loses, I hope that you and vice president Liu Can personally send an apology to me in the Micro World.” ”

“The micro-world was a common APP in the Chinese painting, literary, chess, and calligraphy worlds. ”

It was similar to Weibo.

“Usually, people in the circle would use this app to communicate. ”

“Sure.”Second Elder did not hesitate at all.

“In second elder’s view, Ye Zhuo was just trying to put on a show. ”

How could someone like Ye Zhuo win against Liu Caiyi without cheating?

It was impossible!

“Ye Zhuo smiled. “Second Elder, I believe that you are a man of your word. If you go back on your word, it will be a Good Show!” ”

“”Don’t worry, I will never go back on my word!”Second elder puffed out his chest. ”

“I am relieved with your words.”Ye Zhuo turned to look at Liu Caiyi. “Where is vice-president Liu?”
