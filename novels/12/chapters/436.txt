“Chapter 437: 122: Big Burning’s domineering entrance, slapping Feng Xianxian in the face! 5”

Translator: 549690339

So it was a single-parent family.

No wonder they were so poor that they couldn’t even wear a top-brand outfit.

“Bai Xiaoman asked again, “Then what does your Uncle Do?””

“Ye burning said concisely, “He delivers packages.””

Delivers packages?

Bai Xiaoman almost laughed out loud.

Her biological mother was a waiter who carried plates.

Her uncle was a delivery man who ran errands.

“Fortunately, ye Zao had the nerve to say it out loud.”

“If it were her, she definitely wouldn’t be as thick-skinned as ye Zao.” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“”What about you, Li Yueyue?”Bai Xiaoman looked at Li Yueyue.”

“Li Yueyue said, “My family raises sheep!””

Raises sheep?

Wasn’t that just a herdsman?

“Li Yueyue’s family was in the prairie, so raising sheep at home wasn’t strange.”

Bai Xiaoman was speechless!

Why did the school assign her two such weird roommates.

“Besides Feng Xianxian’s illustrious family background,.”

“Ye Zhuo and Li Yueyue, each of them is worse than the other.”

They are both low-class people at the bottom of society!

“It seems that in the future, all she has to do is to please Feng Xianxian.”

“After all, Feng Xianxian is the real aristocrat.”

“She doesn’t look bad, either.”

“As long as she could curry favor with Feng Xianxian, perhaps Feng Xianxian could even introduce her to a rich second-generation boyfriend.”

“The more Bai Xiaoman thought about it, the happier she became. She continued, “Oh right, what did the two of you score in the College Entrance Exam? Xianxian was third place in our capital! She scored 743 points!””

“Ye Zhuo said calmly, “I did okay in the exam.””

Okay?

Okay was just not as good as Feng Xianxian!

“If ye Zao had done well in the exam, she would not have lacked the courage to say her results.”

“In a small place like this, there were a lot of extra points for the college entrance exam. Ye Zao probably relied on the extra points to get in.”

“It looked like other than that face, ye Zao was completely useless!”

“Li Yueyue said, “My results were also average.””

Bai Xiaoman knew what to do.

In this dormitory.

“In terms of family background, not only was Feng Xianxian the best.”

“In terms of results, Feng Xianxian was also the best.”

Feng Xianxian’s life was really too good!

Bai Xiaoman was extremely envious.

“Hearing this, Feng Xianxian’s face was also filled with pride.”

This year’s national examination papers were especially difficult.

There were not many who could score above 740 points!

“For her to be able to score 743 points, she was already one of the best among the best!”

“Ye Zao then took out the gifts that he had prepared beforehand. “Oh right, I brought you guys a specialty of our Yun Jing. See if you like it.””

The specialty of Yun Jing was silk.

“Therefore, ye Zao brought everyone a silk scarf.”

“Silk scarves could be used as decorations in summer, and they could keep out the cold in winter.”

“As a student, if he gave a gift that was too expensive, not only would it cause comparisons, but it would also make the students with average family conditions especially awkward. Therefore, ye Zao finally chose a silk scarf with a moderate price.”

Feng Xianxian did not like the gift ye Zao prepared.

“In terms of status, she was many times more respected than ye Zao!”

Ye Zao wanted to use a silk scarf to curry favor with her?

No Way!

“”Thank you,”Feng Xianxian smiled and declined, “But my constitution is special, so I have to use Hermes. If I use other brands, I will become allergic. I appreciate your kindness!””

Hermes was a famous brand in the world.

“However, Feng Xianxian did not expect ye Zao to know about Hermes.”

“After all, Ye Zao was just a country bumpkin who had never seen the market before.”

“If she knew what Hermes was, she would not have prepared such a LOW-class scarf!”

It was simply embarrassing!

“Seeing that Feng Xianxian did not accept it, Bai Xiaoman also did not accept it. “I have many scarves at home, but they are all new and unused. One of them is even from Gucci. I have used them as my trump card! It would be a waste if I accept it!””

Ye Zao wasn’t embarrassed. His expression remained the same as he placed the gift box on the table.

“Li Yueyue really liked the scarves that ye Zao gave her. In their prairie, there were very few merchants that sold silk products. Even if there were, they were all imitations and very few could buy silk products.”

“”Thank you, Ye Zao. I like it very much!””

“You’re welcome.”Ye Zao smiled slightly.

“As Li Yueyue spoke, she tied the silk scarf around her neck. “Ye Zao, Do You Like It?””

It could be seen that she really liked this silk scarf.

“It’s nice.”Ye Zao nodded.

Bai Xiaoman’s eyes were filled with disgust.

It was just a broken silk scarf.

“Look at Li Yueyue’s expression, she had never seen anything good before.”

Birds of a feather flock together.

A high-class person like her should be with a noble like Feng Xianxian.

“Li Yueyue and Ye Zhuo, these two low-class people, should be with low-class people.”

...

On the other side.

In the male dormitory.

Lin Ze was video-chatting with Li Wen and fat tiger and dog two.

Dog Two was also at Beijing University.

But he wasn’t in the same dormitory as Lin Ze.
