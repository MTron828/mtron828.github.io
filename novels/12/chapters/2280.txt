“Chen Jinyan understood the logic, but he was afraid that Bai Jingshu only wanted Chen Yaosheng to go to jail. ”

“Chen Yaojun saw through Chen Jinyan’s thoughts and continued, “Dad, don’t worry. Bai Jingshu took such a long detour to send Yaosheng to the detention center. It’s impossible for her to have no purpose at all.” ”

“What if there really is no purpose?”Chen Jinyan asked back.

“Chen Yaojun frowned. “If she didn’t have a motive, Yaosheng could only admit defeat. However, it’s almost impossible. No woman can resist the temptation of fame and fortune.”Bai Jingshu was naturally no exception. ”

“After listening to Chen Yaojun’s words, Chen Jinyan felt much more at ease. He continued, “Has everything been settled on Zi Zhou Island?” ”

“There are no more problems.”Chen Yaojun shook his head. “You don’t have to worry. The most important thing now is yaosheng.”

“Chen Jinyan looked at Chen Yaojun and sighed. “If your brother was half as sensible as you, I wouldn’t have to worry so much!” ”

“Chen Yaojun said, “Dad, don’t be anxious. There will be a way to solve it.” ”

Chen Jinyan nodded. “It has already happened. It’s useless for me to be anxious.”

“”Yaojun, you said that Bai Jingshu has other motives and will come to our house in person. When will she come back?” ”

“Chen Yaojun continued, “It won’t take more than three days at most. If she doesn’t come in three days, we can only think of other ways.” ”

Three days later was the date of the trial.

“Under normal circumstances, Bai Jingshu would definitely come to the Chen family and make her final request. ”

“Alright.”Madam Chen nodded.

“Just like Chen Jinyan, she trusted her eldest son very much. ”

...

On the other side.

At the Bai family’s old residence.

“Old Master Bai invited a doctor over. Fortunately, Bai Jingshu was fine. ”

“When he heard the doctor say that Bai Jingshu was fine as long as she paid attention to her nutrition in the later stages, old master Bai heaved a sigh of relief. “I’ve troubled you to make a trip, Doctor Wu.” ”

“”Elder Bai, you’re too polite. This is what I should do,”doctor Wu said. ”

Elder Bai stood up and sent Doctor Wu out of the door.

“Just as he sent Doctor Wu away, Bai Jingfei came over. ”

“Grandfather!”

Elder Bai looked up at Bai Jingfei. “Your sister was just talking about you.”

“Where is she?”Bai Jingfei asked.

“Elder bai said, “She’s in the house.” ”

“I’ll go in and take a look.”Bai Jingfei walked in.

“Old Master Bai had seven granddaughters and ten grandchildren. His favorite granddaughter was Bai Jingshu, so other than Bai Jingshu, no one else in the Bai family’s old mansion had their own bedroom. ”

“When she was young, Bai Jingfei had always been very envious of Bai Jingshu. ”

“Bai Jingshu’s bedroom was decorated in a dreamy, pink and tender way, and it was still the same even now. ”

“Favoritism!”Bai Jingshu muttered softly as soon as she entered the bedroom.

“Other People’s grandfathers would always be secretive about favoritism, but Old Master Bai was doing it openly, as if he was afraid that his other grandchildren would not know that he was favoring Bai Jingshu. ”

Bai Jingshu heard the commotion and looked outside. “Jingfei.”

“”Bai Jingshu, I saved you once. How are you going to repay me?”Bai Jingfei walked up to Bai Jingshu. ”

“How do you want me to repay you?”Bai Jingshu asked.

“”I need a boyfriend,”Bai Jingfei said. ”

Bai Jingshu raised her eyebrows slightly. “You want me to introduce you to a boyfriend?”

“”Smart. As expected of my sister, Bai Jingfei!”Bai jingfei would never hide her thoughts. ”

“What kind of man are you looking for?”Bai Jingshu asked.

Bai Jingfei looked at Bai Jingshu. “I think you know very well.”

“”You’re not interested in Manwen, are you?”Bai Jingshu retorted. ”

“Bai jingfei smiled and said, “Don’t worry. I’m not Bai Mo. I know myself well enough to know that Manwen won’t be interested in me!” ”

“Bai Mo’s heart was as high as the sky, but unfortunately, his life was as thin as paper. ”

“Bai Jingshu knew how much she weighed, so she didn’t think about all that nonsense. ”

She just wanted to find someone she liked and have a decent background.

“As far as the eye could see, Zhou yuanman, Bai Jingshu’s primary school classmate, was the most suitable for her. ”

“Most importantly, Zhou Yuanman’s appearance was also more in line with her aesthetic standards! ”

“After Bai Jingshu’s incident, Bai jingfei only wanted to find her Prince Charming as soon as possible. She didn’t want to end up like Bai Jingshu, becoming a tool in her parents’hands. When the tool had its own ideas.., they came up with a method to clone her. ” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Bai Jingfei was different from Bai Jingshu. Bai Jingshu had her grandfather’s support, while Bai Jingfei had nothing. If she was cloned, then she really was cloned! ”
