“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “Mom, I’m not hungry for the time being. But I want to eat hairy blood curd tonight.” ”

“It was strange to say that Bai Jingshu wanted to eat something spicy right now. Whenever she thought of hairy blood curd, she would start drooling. ”

“Ye Shu quickly said, “Then I’ll go to the kitchen to make it now. Do you want to eat something spicy, or do you want to Eat Something Normal?” ”

“”I don’t need it now. I’ll eat it tonight.”Bai Jingshu thought for a moment and continued, “I want to eat something really spicy. It’s best if it’s so spicy that my whole body sweats!” ”

“”Okay, okay, okay.”Ye Shu was relieved. She smiled and said, “Everyone says that it’s sour and spicy girls. Jingshu is definitely pregnant with a daughter!” ”

“”Mom, sour and spicy girls are pseudoscience.”Ye Zhuo continued, “Some people who are pregnant with a boy still like to eat spicy food. Specifically, it depends on their constitution.” ”

“”Who said it’s pseudoscience?”Ye Shu said, “When I was pregnant with you and your brother, I liked to eat both sour and spicy food. In the end, it turned out to be a boy and a girl! So, sometimes these words have some origins.” ”

“Bai Jingshu continued, “Then ah ze must be so happy. He wants a daughter even in his dreams.” ”

“”Sister-in-law, What About You?”Ye Zao asked, “Do you like a son or a daughter?” ”

“Bai Jingshu rubbed her belly and smiled gently. “I like boys. Just like your brother, I’m Indomitable.” ” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“After saying that, Bai Jingshu looked at ye Zao and asked, “Zao, What About You? Do You Like Boys or Girls?” ”

“”I can do either.”Ye Zao continued, “I haven’t thought about it yet!”It was better to let fate decide. ”

“”What about your Mr. Cen?”Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “Does he like girls like Ah Ze?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Maybe all men are the same!”

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “After all, daughters are Daddy’s intimate little cotton-padded jacket!” ”

“What is a son?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“”A leaky vest,”Bai Jingshu answered. ”

“Ye Shu, who was listening from the side, also laughed out loud. “Young people nowadays really know how to play.” ”

“It was one thing for a son to be a vest, but a leaky vest! ”

“Ye Shu continued, “The two of you stay here and chat. I’ll go get some snacks.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded.

“Bai Jingshu continued, “Mom, bring some jasmine tea along.” ”

“I know.”

“Bai Jingshu liked drinking jasmine tea very much, so ye Shu would always get someone to prepare it beforehand. ”

The mother-in-law and daughter-in-law got along very well and didn’t have any complicated conflicts.

...

The Cen family.

“After confirming the wedding date, old Mrs. Cen started to make arrangements for the wedding. ”

“Although there was still some time before the wedding date, the wedding matters were quite complicated. In addition, Cen Shaoqing wanted to give ye Zhuo a grand wedding, so he naturally had to arrange it in advance. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen wore her reading glasses and walked over to Cen Shaoqing with a red list. “Shaoqing, what do you think of the design here?” ”

Cen Shaoqing took the proposal list. “Let me take a look.”

“She had thought that Cen Shaoqing would just take a look. After all, this person did not seem to care about anything. She had not expected that Cen Shaoqing would not only look at it very carefully, but he would also give old Mrs. Cen a lot of suggestions. ”

“Seeing him look at it with a straight face, old madam CEN could not help but sigh. “One thing begets another!” ”

“A moment later, Cen Shaoqing returned the list to Old Madam Cen. “Grandma, I have already changed the parts that need to be changed.” ”

“Old Madam Cen smiled and took it. “Alright, we’ll do it according to what you’ve changed.” ”

“”Oh right, there’s one more thing.”Old Madam Cen adjusted her glasses as if she had thought of something. ”

“What is it?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Did you ask if Zhongruo likes a western-style wedding or a chinese-style wedding?” ”

“”I’m fine with either,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen was a little speechless and said, “Who asked you? I asked about zhongruo!” ”

“After saying that, old Mrs. Cen continued, “Actually, I still prefer a chinese-style wedding. That phoenix coronet and gown is so festive and lively!” ”

“Of course, the final decision was still up to Ye Zao. ”

“If ye Zao liked a western-style wedding, then old Mrs. Cen would immediately change her preferences. Now that it was the young people’s world, of course she had to respect the young people’s thoughts. ”

Cen Shaoqing picked up his phone. “Then I’ll ask our leader.”

“Just ask on the phone?”Old Mrs. Cen asked.

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“The old lady continued, “How can you ask such a big thing on the phone! It’s still early. Go to the Searing House.” ”
