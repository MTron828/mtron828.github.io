“Gu decing received the glass bottle with both hands. “Yes, Miss Ye.” ”

“How long will it take to send out the report?”Ye Zhuo continued to ask.

Gu decing looked at the glass bottle in her hand. “Is this Chinese Medicine?”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Are there any medicinal dregs?”Gu decing continued to ask.

“No.”

“GU dening continued, “If there are no medicinal dregs, it will probably take some time. The main thing will depend on how many kinds of Chinese medicine are there.”With all kinds of Chinese medicine mixed together, even a sophisticated machine.., would not be able to analyze everything in a short period of time. ”

“After saying that, gu dening said again, “Miss Ye, I will speed up the processing for you. Try to analyze everything within a period of time. Oh right, where are you now? I will send it over to you when the time comes.” ”

Gu dening was busy with all sorts of experiments all day long and did not know that ye Zhuo had been recognized by the Lin family. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Ye Zhuo said, “I’m staying at 618 Jinxiu Manor on Shanhe Road. Sister Dening, I’ll have to trouble you with this matter.” ”

“Gu dening smiled and said, “Miss Ye, you’re too kind! Please wait for me for a while. I’ll go in and change my clothes. Let’s go for a meal?” ”

“Sure.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“Gu dening turned to look at the front desk. “Xiao Zuo, take Miss Ye to the VIP room.” ”

“Okay.”

Xiao Zuo was stunned.

Gu dening was the second person to cure cancer and held a supreme position in the medical world. She had never seen gu dening so respectful to anyone.

It seemed that this miss ye must have an extraordinary status.

“At the same time, Little Zuo was also glad that he did not neglect ye Zao just now. ”

“”Miss Ye, come with me.” ”

Ye Zao followed Little Zuo to the VIP room.

This VIP room was usually used to receive medical professors or people who had made significant contributions to the medical world.

It was the first time Little Zuo had seen a guest as young as ye Zao.

“Ye Zao waited inside for about 20 minutes before gu dening pushed the door open and came in. “Miss Ye, sorry to keep you waiting.” ”

“It’s okay.”Ye Zhuo looked back slightly.

Gu dening changed into her daily clothes.

“She was not interested in brands. She just wanted to be comfortable. There was no makeup on her face, only some lipstick. She looked very plain. ”

“”Miss Ye, I know a French restaurant nearby that’s pretty good. Why don’t we go for a French meal?”Under normal circumstances, a French meal had to be booked, but because Gu Dening was a member of the restaurant, there was no need to make a reservation. ”

“Sure.”

The French restaurant was right next to the laboratory.

They arrived very quickly by car.

“F people were all very romantic. In addition, the owner of this French restaurant was an authentic f person, so the decoration of the restaurant was very romantic. Elegant piano music poured out from the hands of the cellist. ”

The waiter brought the two to the private room.

“Although gu dening had worked with ye Zhuo before, this was the first time gu dening treated ye Zhuo to a meal. ”

“Although ye Zao was only 19 years old, Gu Dening had never treated her like a little girl. ”

“”Miss Ye, will you be returning to Yun Jing during the New Year?” ”

“I might not be able to go back until the new year is over. What About You?”

“Gu dening took a sip of her drink. “My parents are both in Yun Jing. If I have time, I’ll definitely go back.” ”

The two of them chatted as they ate.

The French food was served very slowly.

“Two and a half hours later, the two of them walked out of the private room. ”

“Zha Zha!”

“At this moment, a surprised male voice appeared behind Ye Zha. ”

“Uncle?”Ye Zha looked back slightly and saw Ye Sen in a suit and leather shoes.

Ye Sen had been very busy recently and always flew abroad. Ye Zha had not seen him for almost a month. He did not expect to see him in the restaurant today.

“”Zao Zao, you’re here for dinner too? Where’s Ah Ze?” ”

“I’ve eaten.”Zao nodded slightly. “My brother didn’t come. I ate with sister De Ning.”

“Gu De Ning smiled and greeted ye Sen. “Hello, Mr. Ye.” ”

“”Hello, Doctor Gu.”Ye Sen then saw Gu de Ning beside ye Zao. ”

“Ye Sen then introduced the man beside him. “President Wang, this is my eldest niece. This is my eldest niece’s friend, doctor Gu. Zao Zao, Doctor Gu, this is president Wang.” ”

“President Wang looked like a very smart middle-aged man. After ye Sen introduced him, he immediately extended his hand to ye Zhuo and doctor gu, “My niece, doctor Gu.” ”

Ye Zhuo and gu dening shook hands with President Wang.

“During the process, president Wang looked at Gu Dening and felt that he had seen gu dening somewhere before, but he could not remember where he had seen her before... ”

“Ye Sen had come to talk about cooperation today. After greeting her, ye Zhuo continued, “Uncle, we won’t bother you anymore. We’ll go back first.” ”
