Bai Mo’s words had hit the nail on the head of Bai Sanfeng.

That was how she felt right now.

“She tried her best to persuade Bai Jingshu, but not only did she not appreciate her advice, she even felt that she was a bad person. ”

“”Mo Mo is still sensible.”Bai Sanfeng patted Bai Mo’s hand. She suddenly felt that she had neglected her niece in the past. “Mo Mo, when you have time, you must visit your great-aunt’s house.” ”

“”Okay.”Bai Mo nodded. She held Bai Sanfeng’s hand and said, “Great-aunt, you can go to my house tonight!” ”

Bai Sanfeng’s husband’s house was not bad. She was also the old lady in charge of the Chen family. She had befriended many wealthy and influential people. Perhaps she could even help her with ye Han’s matter.

“In fact, Bai Mo had wanted to curry favor with Bai Sanfeng for a long time, but she had never found a suitable opportunity. ”

“That’s fine.”Bai Sanfeng nodded.

“Bai Mo held Bai Sanfeng’s arm and smiled. “If my parents knew that great-aunt is coming, they would definitely be very happy!” ”

Bai Sanfeng looked at Bai Mo and felt that Bai Mo was more pleasing to the eye than Bai Jingshu.

At least Bai Mo knew what was good and what was bad.

“The next day, Lin Ze came to the Bai family’s old residence. ”

The grandfather and grandson sat in the study.

“Elder Bai looked at Lin Ze. “Xiao Lin, Jingshu is my favorite granddaughter. She’s also the granddaughter that I can’t rest assured about. You know about her and her parents...” ”

Lin Ze had been listening to elder Bai’s words attentively. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Elder bai continued, “My biggest dream in my lifetime is to see Jingshu find a reliable person who can protect her with her life. Can you do that?” ”

“At the end of his sentence, elder Bai looked up at Lin Ze. ”

“”Grandpa, I can.”Lin Ze looked into elder Bai’s eyes. His gaze was firm, and his voice was equally firm. ”

“”Good! Good!”Elder Bai laughed out loud. “Grandpa, I didn’t Misjudge You! How about this, you make the arrangements and see when your parents can meet with me. I’ll tell your parents the details.” ”

“Please Wait a moment. I’ll contact them right away.”Lin Ze stood up.

“”Okay, go ahead.”Elder Bai nodded. ”

“After a while, Lin Ze came in from outside. “Grandpa, my parents said that they can come over anytime.” ”

“”Come over?”Elder Bai was stunned for a moment, then he waved his hand and said, “No, no, I’ll go over. Speaking of which, I haven’t been to Earth for a long time.” ”

“”That’s not good, is it?”Lin Ze said. ”

“After all, he was the one who asked to marry Bai Jingshu. It should be his parents who came to the Bai family on their own accord. How could he let elder Bai go to Earth personally? ”

It was impolite.

“Elder bai smiled and said, “As long as your intentions are there, it’s fine. We don’t have to care about those empty words. Then, we’ll leave now. Go and call Jingshu!” ”

“Leave Now?”Lin Ze was stunned.

“Yes.”Elder Bai nodded.

“Okay.”Lin Ze didn’t say anything else and immediately went to look for Bai Jingshu.

“After hearing Lin Ze’s words, Bai Jingshu wasn’t too surprised because elder Bai had already given her a warning. ”

“Lin Ze.”Bai Jingshu called out to Lin Ze.

“”Okay,”Lin ze replied. ”

“Bai Jingshu looked at Lin Ze and continued, “You should know what Grandpa Means, right?” ”

“I do.”

“Bai Jingshu continued, “Okay. If you think that things between us are progressing too quickly, I’ll go talk to Grandpa.” ”

“After all, they had only known each other for less than a year. Bai Jingshu could understand why Lin Ze couldn’t accept the fact that they had gotten married so quickly. ”

“”Then, can you accept it?”Lin Ze asked back. ”

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “I’m the one asking you now.” ”

“”I can accept it,”Lin Ze continued. “Even though we’ve only known each other for a year, I’m very sure that you’re the person I want to spend the rest of my life with. I don’t want anyone else but you.” ”

This was the most serious love speech Lin Ze had ever given Bai Jingshu.

“His personality was different from other boys. He was not good at expressing his feelings, and most of the time, it was more important than what he said. ”

“”Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded. “With your words, my life will be worth it.” ”

Lin Ze reached out and pulled Bai Jingshu into his embrace.

“The two of them hugged each other for about a minute. Bai Jingshu pushed Lin ze away and said, “Alright, I’ll go get ready. Let’s go back to Earth.” ”

“Okay.”Lin Ze nodded.

“Two hours later, the three of them set foot on the interstellar shuttle back to Earth. ”

“Two days later, the interstellar shuttle landed on Earth as scheduled. ”
