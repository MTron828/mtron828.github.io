“Chapter 1247: 260: Zhao Xueyin’s face was disfigured, and the Zhao family was expelled from the financial world! 4”

Translator: 549690339

Zhao Xueyin had experienced the most embarrassing experience of his life.

He didn’t even want to recall it.

“When Zhao Xueyin returned to the Zhao family, he was in a sorry state. ”

Father Zhao also returned at this time.

“When he saw Zhao Xueyin, Father Zhao was furious. “A Jinx! You’re a Jinx!”If it wasn’t for Zhao Xueyin, the Zhao family wouldn’t be in this state today! ”

There was nothing left.

Everything that he had painstakingly built was all lost at the hands of Zhao Xueyin!

No wonder many people said that women were money-losing goods.

Wasn’t someone like Zhao Xueyin a money-losing goods?

“Zhao Xueyin was also furious. She screamed hysterically, “Can you blame me? It’s ye Zao! It’s all ye Zao! That B * Tch ye Zao! I Won’t let her off!” ”

Zhao Xueyin never dreamed that things would turn out this way for just a cat.

Wasn’t it just a cat?

And it was a Chinese Garden Cat!

This was all ye Zao’s fault.

“If it wasn’t for ye Zao, she wouldn’t have tortured and killed a cat for no reason. ”

“In the end, that wild cat died because of ye Zao. ”

What did it have to do with her?

“Before she met Ye Zao, her life was smooth sailing and her future was bright. ”

“Ever since she met ye Zao, everything had changed! ”

Ye Zao was like the Nemesis in her life.

He was here to counter her!

Father Zhao took a deep breath. “Hurry up and post an apology on your public account and tell everyone that you were wrong!”

“For Zhao Xueyin, this was the only way to go. ”

“Otherwise, she would forever have to face the accusations and online violence from everyone. ”

The Zhao family would also be expelled from the financial world.

“I’m not wrong! It’s Ye Zhuo who’s wrong! What right do I have to apologize?” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Father Zhao slapped Zhao Xueyin’s face.

“Zhao Xueyin only felt a buzzing sound by her ear, and a red and swollen palm print immediately appeared on her left cheek. ”

“Go Apologize!”

“Zhao Xueyin covered her face. “I, I know...” ”

What kind of apology was the most effective?

“Of course, it was to play the victim. ”

“Zhao Xueyin was a smart person. Since things had already come to this point, she had to play the victim until the end! ”

“In order to increase the visual effect, Zhao Xueyin even specially put on a make-up with a sad look. ”

The apology video lasted for a total of ten minutes.

“For a full ten minutes, Zhao Xueyin was crying, crying like a pear blossom in the rain. “I’m sorry, everyone, I was really wrong! I shouldn’t have treated that little kitten like this...” ”

“”I was also obsessed at that time, and I hoped that everyone would give me a chance to turn over a new leaf.” ”

“The little kitten that unfortunately left was an ordinary Chinese garden cat. I’m willing to accompany the owner of the cat with ten civet cats.”

Civet cats were very expensive cats.

The unit price was over ten thousand.

It was many times more expensive than that wild cat!

“Seeing this, the netizens did not buy it. ”

What was an ordinary Chinese garden cat?

What was an expensive civet cat?

Zhao Xueyin’s words were not sincere at all.

[ there is no hierarchy in life! I can see that this socialite did not think of apologizing at all! She was just under pressure and came out to brush it off. ]

[ what is green tea? This is green tea! ]

[ so what if it’s a Chinese garden cat? Looking down on local cats? Do you really think that a few years of studying abroad will give you a layer of gold? ]

[ such a B * Tch deserves to live in this world? ]

[ it’s simply disgusting! ]

“[ everyone, don’t be angry. Shunxi Financial Group just held a press conference. The Zhao family and Zhao Xueyin have already received the corresponding punishment. ] ”

“[ next, the Zhao family father and daughter will be kicked out of the financial world. ] ”

[ karma really does have its own way of doing things. Retribution isn’t good! ]

[ I still feel sorry for that cat. How painful was it back then? I should have let Zhao Xueyin suffer the same pain! ]

[ add one above! ]

[ ... ]

Zhao Xueyin did not expect the netizens to not buy it at all.

The internet was still filled with curses.

Zhao Xueyin was furious.

“She had already apologized, what more did these people want from her? ”

“”Miss.”At this moment, the sound of a servant knocking on the door came from the air. ”

“”Come in,”Zhao Xueyin said. ”

“The servant pushed the door open and entered. She handed the ointment in her hand to Zhao Xueyin, “Miss, this is the ointment that master asked me to give you.” ”

What was the most important thing for a girl?

“Of course, it was her face! ”

“Although Father Zhao had hit Zhao Xueyin, he was still Zhao Xueyin’s father. No matter what, he could not let Zhao Xueyin’s face be disfigured. ”

Zhao Xueyin took the ointment and applied it on her face.

“The moment she applied it, she felt an ice-cold and very comfortable feeling. ”
