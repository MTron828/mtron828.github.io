“In a short while, he finished the whole dessert. ”

“”I’m done, great-aunt. Look, I didn’t waste anything!”Scarface showed the empty box to ye Zao. ”

“Scarface had dealt with Chinese people before, so he knew what the word ‘great-aunt’meant in China. ”

“Ye Zao glanced at him and slowly put away his gun. He continued, “Go back and tell Jin Yuyan that a rat hiding in the dark is the most despised. She’s a princess of Korea, so don’t do something disgusting!” ”

“”Yes, yes, yes!”Scarface nodded repeatedly. “I will definitely deliver your words.” ”

“After saying that, Scarface was stunned. ”

How did ye Zao know that the person who sent him here was Jin Yuyan?

“Get lost.”

“”I will get lost, I will get lost!”Scarface said while rolling on the ground several times. ”

“Halfway through rolling, Scarface seemed to remember something and stood up ye Zao. “My, My Gun...” ”

Ye Zao lowered his eyes slightly and looked at him.

“Scarface hurriedly said, “I’ll... Give It to you! I’ll get lost again! Get lost again! Please don’t be angry! Don’t be angry!” ”

“Carl was overjoyed. “An, you’re really amazing! If you were a man, I would definitely marry you!” ”

What a pity.

Such an outstanding person was actually a girl.

“Ye Zhuo glanced at him. “If I were a man, the person who wants to marry me would be able to hold hands and circle the Earth at least ten times. As for you, you still have to queue up!” ”

“Carl smiled and said, “So, we can only be brothers for the rest of our lives! Right, you just said that the Scarface was sent by Jin Yuyan. When did you offend Jin Yuyan?” ”

Ye Zhuo shrugged helplessly. “I don’t know either.”

“After saying that, Ye Zhuo rubbed his chin and said thoughtfully, “It’s also possible that she’s jealous that I’m prettier than her! After all, I’m so good-looking!” ”

She had only rejected Jin Yuyan’s invitation to change her nationality. She did not expect that Jin Yuyan would not give up.

It was definitely Jin Yuyan who was jealous that she was prettier than her.

Carl:”...”

On the other side.

China.

On the 58th floor of the CITIC Tower.

“The man placed one hand on the railing and the other on the prayer beads. He stood in front of the French window and watched the sun slowly rise from the east. His posture was casual, but it gave off a powerful aura. ”

“The golden sunlight shone in from the French window. The Man stood against the light, making his figure look even taller. He looked like an emperor looking down on the world. ”

“At this moment, a knock on the door broke the silence in the room. ”

“”Come in.”The man looked back slightly, revealing an exquisitely carved face. ”

“Fifth Master.”Special Assistant Li walked in from outside the door.

Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted slightly. “Speak.”

“Looking at Cen Shaoqing like this, special assistant Li subconsciously shrunk his neck. ”

Today was the fifth day that ye Zhuo had left the capital.

Cen Shaoqing seemed to have become the CEN Shaoqing from before.

He was serious and serious.

He ate vegetarian food and prayed to Buddha.

“Therefore, based on Cen Shaoqing’s daily reactions, the CEN group’s employees could guess whether ye Zao was in the capital or not. ”

“After taking a moment to recover, special assistant Li continued, “Fifth master, Miss Ye seems to be in trouble in C Nation.” ”

“Hearing this, Cen Shaoqing immediately turned around. “Is She Alright?” ”

“Miss Ye is temporarily fine. You Don’t have to worry.”

Temporarily Fine?

“Hearing this, Cen Shaoqing frowned. “Who is it?” ”

“”The eldest princess of Korea, Jin Yuyan,”special assistant Li said. ”

“Jin Yuyan.”Cen Shaoqing narrowed his eyes.

“Special assistant Li continued, “Fifth Master, do you need me to contact Korea?” ”

“No matter how powerful Korea was, it was only an island country. ”

“In Cen Shaoqing’s eyes, it was nothing. ”

“With the power behind Cen Shaoqing, let alone Korea, even if there were two of them, he wouldn’t care. ”

“No need.”Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted.

No need?

Special Assistant Li was stunned. Cen Shaoqing had always been the most nervous about ye Zhuo.

“But now, he was actually going to stand by and watch. ”

Could it be...

That something was wrong with their relationship?

“Before special assistant Li could react, CEN Shaoqing continued, “You can go out first.” ”

“Yes.”

Special Assistant Li turned around and left.

“Cen Shaoqing took out his phone and made a call. Very soon, the call was connected. ”

“Get Me Jin Xi en.”

His voice was so cold that it could drip ice.

Jin Xi en.

The current Empress of Korea.

Jin Yu Yan was her eldest daughter.

“Special Assistant Li, who had just walked out of the door, suddenly shivered. ”

Why did he feel that someone was going to be unlucky?
