Translator: 549690339

Lin Qingxuan looked at Zhao shuning as if it was her first time getting to know her.

“Zhao shuning had always been so sensitive. No matter what he said, she would always think of giving birth. ”

Was it really because he couldn’t give birth?

Lin Qingxuan suddenly thought of ye Zhuo’s words and looked at Zhao shuning’s face. His heart suddenly wavered.

Perhaps.

He really should go to the hospital for a checkup.

“Lin Qingxuan sighed. “Shuning, I never thought of abandoning you. You’ve already beaten me up and scolded me. Can I go in now?” ”

“Zhao shuning was still not satisfied. “Kneel for two hours and reflect on yourself! Then, you can sleep on the sofa tonight!” ”

“Okay.”

Zhao shuning took out a washboard from the bathroom.

“A person like Lin Qingxuan should be taught a lesson. Otherwise, he would definitely do it again next time! ”

...

“When Lin Jincheng returned to his room, Ye Shu was already asleep. ”

“She was light-sleeper now. Lin Jincheng deliberately slowed down his footsteps, but he still woke ye Shu up. ”

“Ye Shu subconsciously sat up on the bed and picked up the phone on the bedside table. When she saw that it was already past midnight, she said in surprise, “Have you been chatting with fourth brother until now?” ”

“Lin Jincheng was holding a change of pajamas as he looked at the sleepy ye Shu. For a moment, he was a little stunned. ”

“When she was about to wake up, he seemed to see her from nineteen years ago. ”

Ye Shu was very beautiful.

“She had a very standard oval face, Red Phoenix eyes, and very fair skin. Otherwise, the twenty-year-old Lin Jincheng would not have fallen in love with her at first sight. He would have even given up everything for her. ”

“After the baptism of time, the thirty-nine-year-old ye Shu looked even more charming now. ”

“After a while, Lin Jincheng finally reacted. “Ah Shu, I’m sorry. I woke you up.” ”

“It’s okay.”Ye Shu pulled the Silk Quilt. “Has fourth brother’s problem been solved?”

“Lin Jincheng said, “Did Zhuozhuo tell you?” ”

“What did he say?”Ye Shu asked in puzzlement.

Lin Jincheng continued to tell her about Zhao shuning’s infertility.”... I plan to accompany fourth brother to the hospital tomorrow morning.”

“Hearing this, Ye Shu was also very surprised. ”

“She originally thought that Zhao shuning was just infertile, but she didn’t expect there to be so many twists and turns. ” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“If that was really the case, then Zhao Shuning was a little selfish. ”

It wasn’t her fault that she was infertile.

“However, it was her fault that Lin Qingxuan was blamed for being infertile for more than twenty years. ”

“However, Ye Shu couldn’t comment on Zhao shuning at the moment. After all, the results of the examination weren’t out yet. ”

“”Okay, then you should take a shower and rest early.” ”

“Okay.”Lin Jincheng nodded slightly. “You should rest early too.”

“Ye Shu lifted the quilt. Before her feet even touched the ground, a glass of water was handed to her. “Drink some water.” ”

Ye Shu looked up in surprise. “Thank you.”

“A bitter look appeared in Lin Jincheng’s eyes. It was fleeting. “Ah Shu, we don’t have to be so distant.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Shu took the water.

Lin Jincheng didn’t say anything else. He took his pajamas to the bathroom.

“After a while, there was the sound of water splashing in the air. ”

“When Lin Jincheng came out of the bathroom again, Ye Shu was already asleep. ”

She was still the same as when she was young.

She liked to cover her head when she slept.

“Lin Jincheng stood by the bed for a while before he returned to the sofa. Although he wasn’t a gentleman, he promised ye Shu that he wouldn’t go back on his words. ”

He wouldn’t touch ye Shu until she had completely let go of the knot in her heart.

“That night, Ye Shu had a very long dream. ”

“In the dream, she had returned to the age of nineteen. ”

“When she was young, she and Lin Jincheng had made a promise to each other, full of affection... ”

“That night, some people slept well, while others didn’t. ”

“Soon, it was the next morning. ”

“Although Lin Qingxuan didn’t sleep well last night, he still got up on time this morning. After washing up, he went for a run and then came back for breakfast. ”

“Because of what happened last night, Zhao shuning kept a long face. ”

“Lin Qingxuan deliberately tried to please her and gave her a spring roll. “Shuning, I remember your favorite spring roll with chives and bean sprouts.” ”

PA —

The spring roll was thrown to the ground.

“Did I say I forgive you?”

“Lin Qingxuan’s expression froze for a moment, but she didn’t show it. She picked up the spring roll on the ground, blew it, and took a bite. “It’s not good to waste food. If you don’t eat it, I’ll eat it.” ”

This action stunned the servants in the room.

Not to mention the Lin family.
