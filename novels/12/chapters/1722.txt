Ye Shu turned around to look at Ye Zhuo. “What’s the matter?”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Mom, do you still remember my classmate, Li Yueyue?” ”

Ye Shu shook her head.

“She’s the one who came to stay at our house before.”Ye Zhuo reminded her.

“”OH.”Ye Shu suddenly thought of something and continued, “She’s the one who lives in the Great Prairie and has a pair of dimples, right?” ”

“”Yes, it’s her.”Ye Zao said, “Previously, Aunt Lian asked me to introduce a partner to brother Wei Wei, so I introduced Yueyue to brother Wei.” ”

“Then what did Wei Wei Say?”Ye Shu was quite concerned about Lin Weiwei’s matter.

“Ye Zao said, “For the time being, I just added wechat first. I don’t know what brother Wei is thinking at the moment. I’ve told Yueyue that if the conversation goes well later, we can meet up and continue to develop.” ”

“”En.”Ye Shu nodded, she smiled and said, “If this matter is really successful, it’s pretty good! I think that Yueyue is quite sensible and knows how to take care of others! She’s pretty good-looking too. It’s just that the road is a little far, but it doesn’t matter. Now that the traffic is developed, it’s only a few hours’flight away. Oh right, do you have a photo of Yueyue? I’ll send it to your Aunt Lian to take a look.” ”

“Then I’ll ask Yueyue first.”This kind of thing had to be approved by Li Yueyue.

“”Okay, you go and ask.” ”

Ye Zhuo logged into wechat and told Li Yueyue about the situation.

“[ wait! Great Burning! Don’t send it yet, I’ll send you a nice photo now. ] ”

[ okay. There’s no rush. ]

“About half an hour later, Li Yueyue sent a selfie. ”

“The angle was very good, showing all of Li Yueyue’s good points. ”

“Ye Zhuo sent Li Yueyue’s photo to Ye Shu, who then sent it to Zhou Yuelian. ”

“The more Zhou Yuelian looked at it, the more satisfied she became. She felt that Li Yueyue was the perfect daughter-in-law. She called Lin Weiwei and told him to have a good chat with Li Yueyue. She didn’t want to mess up this matter. ”

Time passed quickly.

“In the blink of an eye, it was time for the college entrance examination results to be released. ”

“Lin Sha sat in front of the computer and looked at the inquiry entrance. Her hands were trembling. She turned to look at Ye Zao on the other end of the screen. “Zao Zao, what should we do? I’m a little nervous.” ”

“”Don’t be nervous.”Ye Zao smiled and said, “Sister Sha Sha, you did well. You can get at least 730 points.” ”

“Lin Shasha nodded and continued, “Then I’ll press it now.” ”

“Press it.”

Lin Shasha pressed the query button.

“Perhaps because there were too many people asking questions, the screen kept turning in circles. ”

“A minute later, the screen finally turned to the normal page. ”

Lin Shasha looked at the computer screen and was stunned.

“Ye Zao looked up slightly, “Sister Shasha, how is it?” ”

Lin Shasha still looked at the screen.

“Sister Shasha?”

“Ye Zao called Out Again, and Lin Shasha finally reacted. She turned to look at Ye Zao. “Zao! I, I, I got 740 points! I’m ranked first in Yunjing City!” ”

“This result was within ye Zao’s expectations. Ye Zao smiled and said, “Sister Shasha, Congratulations.” ”

“Lin Shasha’s eyes were red. “Zao Zao, Thank You!” ”

“”Sister Shasha, I told you, you worked hard to get all this.” ”

Lin Shasha cried out loud.

“She was really excited. Although she knew that her grades had always been good, she did not expect that she could get first place! ”

“If it was not for ye Zao asking her to study again, she would not have such an honor! ”

“”Sister Shasha, don’t cry. Go and tell uncle and Aunt Lian the good news. They will be very happy.” ”

“”Okay.”Lin Shasha wiped her eyes, closed wechat, and prepared to go to the living room to find her parents. ”

“Coincidentally, Zhou Yuelian and Lin Jinshui were about to ask about Lin Shasha’s grades. Seeing Lin Shasha’s red eyes, the couple’s heart skipped a beat. They looked at each other and saw the shock in each other’s eyes. ”

It was obvious that Lin Shasha did not do well in the exams.

“Aunt Zhou Yuelian, who was standing behind them, said, “I told you that books are not easy to read. If everyone could get into university, wouldn’t the world be full of university students?” ”

Zhou Yuelian had never been optimistic about Lin Shasha quitting her job to study again.

It would have been fine if she had married a better girl! She had to go to the college entrance exam!

“It would be fine if she really got into the exam, but if she did not get into the exam, it would be a waste of time and money. ”

“Moreover, Lin Shasha was twenty-three years old this year! ” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“A twenty-three-year-old girl loafing around at home all day. She didn’t think about how to earn money, and all she did was daydream. ”

She even got into university!

“It wasn’t that she looked down on her niece, Lin Shasha. ”
