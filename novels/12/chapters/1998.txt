“That’s right, this youth in front of him was the only son of the six clan leaders. ”

Guangxing.

“Ten years ago, Guangxing had gone insane because he had seen something he shouldn’t have seen. Even now, he was still different from ordinary people. ”

“Normally, it was still fine. ”

“If he had been provoked, he would be like this. Not only would he do things that would hurt himself, he would also do things that would hurt others. ”

The sixth clan leader’s words made the youth in front of him become even more agitated. His eyes widened and were extremely terrifying.

“”Murderer, I’m going to kill you!” ”

“The sixth clan leader wept bitterly and knelt on the ground, “I’m sorry, Xing ‘er, it’s Daddy who has let you down! Daddy has let you down!” ”

Bang Bang Bang —

It was as if Guang Xing could break out of the iron cage at any time.

“Looking at his son like this, the sixth chief’s eyes were filled with heartache. ”

It was very heartache.

“But when he thought about how his son would soon return to normal, the sixth chief’s eyes lit up again. ”

After a long time.

“The sixth chief stood up from the ground, wiped his tears, and turned to leave. ”

“After walking out of the secret room, his expression returned to normal, as if that scene had never happened before. ”

He had just arrived at the hall.

“The butler walked over, “Master.” ”

“What’s Wrong?”The sixth chief turned to look at the butler.

“The butler continued, “The young master has sent a letter.” ”

“The sixth chief said excitedly, “Really? Quickly bring it to me to have a look!” ”

“Really!”The Butler nodded and handed a letter to the sixth chief.

“The sixth chief smiled and said, “Alright, Alright, you can go out first.” ”

The butler bent over and walked out.

The sixth clan leader opened the letter and sat on the sofa to read it carefully.

“In fact, his appearance was just to deceive people. ”

“Guangxing was imprisoned in a dark room by him, where did the young master come from to write a letter to him? ”

“Ten years ago, Guangxing was suddenly stimulated and turned from a normal child into a lunatic. The sixth clan leader had always been a person who cared about face, how could he tolerate his own child being ridiculed by others? Themselves being ridiculed? ”

“If they were discovered that a lunatic had appeared in their Guang family, where would their old face go? ”

“In order to avoid being discovered, he locked Guangxing in a dark room. ”

This lock would last for ten years.

“After that, he announced to the public that Guangxing had been accepted by the General Alliance Military Academy. The General Alliance Military Academy had strict rules and prohibited students from contacting their families during the school period. ”

The only way to contact them was through the oldest method.

Letters.

“Therefore, over the past ten years, the six clan leaders had always created the illusion that Guangxing was receiving training at the Military Academy. No one had ever doubted the truth of the matter. ”

Soon.

“Soon, Guangxing would be able to see the light of day again! ”

The six clan leaders narrowed their eyes.

...

On the other side.

Lin family.

“After celebrating ye Shu’s birthday, Ye Zhuo set off to the s galaxy. ”

She did not tell her family about this. She only said that she was going to stay on Mars for a while.

“Ye Zao was often so busy that he did not return home for a long time. Therefore, his family did not suspect anything. ”

Mars.

“Standing in front of the interstellar shuttle, Ye Zao turned to look at Cen Shaoqing. “I’ll be leaving first.” ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “Be careful.”

“I will.”

“Ye Zao had just pressed down the shapeshifting device on his wrist when he was suddenly pulled into Cen Shaoqing’s arms by a domineering force. He hugged her tightly. “Zao Zao, I’ll wait for you here.” ”

“”Okay.”Ye Zao smiled and said, “Don’t worry. I’ll rush back immediately after I’ve investigated everything.” ”

Cen Shaoqing hugged her tightly and did not say anything.

“He was afraid that if he let go, she would never come back. ”

Ye Zao put his arm around his neck and kissed his thin lips with his red lips. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

This kiss was more intense than the previous ones.

“A few minutes later, Cen Shaoqing let go of her. Both of them were slightly panting. ”

“After a while, CEN Shaoqing continued, “Go early and come back early.” ”

“”Okay.”Ye Zao stood on his toes and kissed his lips. Then, he pressed the shapeshifting device and his body rapidly shrank. He entered the interstellar shuttle and activated the button. ”

Shoo —

“The next second, the interstellar shuttle directly turned into a ray of light and disappeared in front of his eyes. ”

“Cen Shaoqing looked at the direction where the interstellar shuttle had disappeared, unable to regain his senses for a long time. ”

Three days later.

Changyue country.

“Qiu Di was sitting in his office flipping through documents when his assistant hurriedly ran in. “Miss, something bad has happened!” ”

“”What’s Wrong?”Qiu Di raised his head, his eyes filled with displeasure. ”

“The assistant continued, “Miss, Miss Ye, Miss Ye is missing!” ”

“Didn’t she die long ago?”Qiu di frowned slightly.

“The assistant said, “The ye family base sent a message saying that Miss Ye’s body is missing.” ”

“What?”Qiu Di’s face turned pale.

How could ye Zhuo’s body be missing?

Could it be...

Ye Zhuo had resurrected?

No.

It was impossible!

“Dr. Maya had studied for 20 years and finally boiled herself to death. However, she could not find any medicine that could bring people back to life. ”

The person who stole ye Zao’s body must be ye Zao’s enemy!

He wanted to burn ye Zao’s bones and scatter his ashes.

Yes.

That must be the case.

Qiu Di narrowed her eyes.

“With the election coming up, she could not lose her footing in this place. ”

“After calming down, Qiu di made a trip to the detention room. ”

Yi Ling was still locked in the detention room.

“Have you thought about it?”Qiu Di looked down at her from above.

Yi Ling was hanging on to her last breath.

“Although there was the intervention of Qiu Chang Zhen, Qiu Di still did not treat her well these days. ”

“Instead, she was even more ruthless than before. ”

“In the past, she could at least eat her fill once every two days. But now, she could only replenish her energy once every three days, and each time, she was only half full. ”

This kind of feeling was very uncomfortable. It was even more unbearable than death.

“”Are you still waiting for Your Miss Ye to save you?”The corners of autumn flute’s mouth curled up into a proud arc. “Let me tell you, not only is your miss ye dead, but now, her remains have been stolen and turned into ashes!” ”

“No!”Yi Ling glared at autumn flute. “You’re lying!”

Great Burning was the most powerful great burning in the world.

She wouldn’t die!

No!

“Qiu di continued, “I’ll give you another day to think about it. If you still don’t know what’s good for you, Don’t blame me for being rude!” ”

“Saying that, Qiu di turned around and left. ”

Yi Ling looked in the direction where she disappeared and closed her eyes tiredly.

She felt that she really couldn’t hold on any longer.

When would great burning come to save her?

“”Doggie...”at this moment, a clear and shallow voice suddenly appeared in the air. ”

Great Burning!

This voice was great burning.

Great burning came to save it!

“The clothes spirit was extremely excited, but in the next second, it became dispirited again. It did not even bother to open its eyes. ”

Auditory hallucination.

It was definitely another auditory hallucination.

“These days, it had heard this kind of auditory hallucination more than once. ”

Why isn’t he used to it?

Click.

The lock is unlocked.
