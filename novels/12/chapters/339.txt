“Bai Wei’s vanity was well satisfied by the manager. She reached out and took the skincare products. “Since manager Zhou has said so, I’ll forgive her this time!” ”

“”Thank you, Miss Bai.”The manager bowed again. ”

“Bai Wei turned to look at Little Wang, her eyes full of contempt, “You’re called Little Wang, right? Remember to be smart when you do things in the future. Do you know what brand my shoes are? Can you afford to pay for them if they’re damaged? I think the biggest thing you can do in your life is to be a lowly shopkeeper!” ” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Unlike her, who was about to fly to a branch and become a rich lady. ”

Bai Wei raised her chin and walked out of the door.

“In the shop, the shopkeeper didn’t look too good. ”

How could the shopkeeper be so humble? !

“Ye Shu, who had witnessed the whole process, also frowned slightly. ”

It could be seen that Miss Bai was not an easy person to get along with.

“After buying the skincare products, the mother and daughter went to the jewelry store on the third floor and picked out a bracelet for Bai Wei. ”

“As everyone knew, a woman’s wardrobe was always short of a piece of clothing, so after leaving the jewelry store, the two went to the clothing store on the fourth floor. ”

It was not until four o’clock in the afternoon that the two of them returned with a full load

“Ye Zhuo had not gotten his driver’s license yet, so ye Shu did not know how to drive, so the two of them had to take a taxi home. Ye Zhuo suggested, “Mom, if you are free, you can learn to drive.” ”

“Learn to drive?”Ye Shu was stunned.

“Ye Zhuo nodded. “You often go on business trips, so it’s more convenient for you to learn to drive.” ”

These words were true. It was inconvenient to go anywhere without knowing how to drive.

“Ye Shu continued, “At my age, is it easy to learn a driver’s license?” ”

“Learning a driver’s license was a young matter. She was already 39 this year, and Ye Shu was worried that she wouldn’t be able to learn it. ”

“Ye Zhuo chuckled. “How Old Are You? If people who don’t know heard you, they would think that you’re already 70 or 80! Actually, learning to drive is especially easy! It’s not difficult at all.” ”

“”Compared to a bicycle, which one is easier?”Ye Shu asked. ”

“Before coming to this world, ye Zhuo had only seen bicycles on the computer, so he said, “Of course a car is easier.” ”

“Really?”Ye Shu asked in surprise.

Ye Zhuo nodded. “Of course it’s true.”

“Ye Shu said, “Then I’ll find some time to get a driver’s license.” ”

“Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and continued, “Mom, I just called for an online car booking. Wait here for the car. There’s a milk tea shop in front. I’ll go buy two cups of milk tea. What flavor of milk tea do you want?” ”

“”Red bean milk tea will do,”ye Shu said. ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo ran to the milk tea shop.

“Ye Zhuo had just left when a seventeen or eighteen-year-old boy walked over from behind. “Auntie, you dropped your wallet.” ”

Ye Shu raised her head slightly and was stunned when she saw the youth’s face.

This child...

Looked so familiar.

“Right at that moment, ye Shu suddenly remembered that this child was the top scorer of the Beijing College entrance examination that she had seen on television. ”

He looked too much like that person from back then.

His shadow could be seen between his brows.

Ye Shu was slightly startled when she suddenly remembered that person.

Was the youth in front of her really his child?

“Ye Shu wasn’t the only one who was surprised, but also Lin Ze. ”

Lin Ze didn’t expect that the owner of this phone was actually the aunt he saw on TV the last time.

Because his mother was in Yunjing.

“Therefore, he remembered everything about Yunjing very clearly. ”

“At that time, he even suspected that this aunt might be his mother. ”

“Now that he thought about it, it was impossible. ”

“This Auntie’s daughter was the same age as him, and she was also this year’s college entrance examinee. ”

How could she give birth to two children of similar age at the same time?

It was very obvious.

The timing did not match.

“”Auntie, is this your wallet?”Seeing that ye Shu did not speak for a long time, Lin Ze spoke again. ”

“Only then did ye Shu react. She nodded and said, “It’s my wallet.” ”

“Lin Ze continued, “To confirm if this wallet is yours, can you tell me what’s in this wallet?” ”

“Ye Shu said, “In addition to the card and the money, there’s also a photo of me and my daughter. You can open it and take a look.” ”

Lin Ze opened the wallet and indeed saw the photo in the wallet.

“”Auntie, here’s your wallet back.” ”

“Thank you.”Ye Shu took it with both hands.

Lin Ze smiled. “You’re welcome.”

“When the youth smiled, there was a faint dimple on the side of his face, which overlapped with the person in his memory. ”

Could it be that this was really that person’s child?

“Ye Shu continued, “Young man, there’s a milk tea shop in front. To express my gratitude, I’ll treat you to a cup of milk tea, okay?” ”

“Lin Ze was not in the mood to drink milk tea now that his mother was nowhere to be found. “Aunty, I appreciate your kindness, but I have something urgent to attend to. I’ll be leaving First!” ”

“With that, Lin Ze turned around and left. ”

Ye Shu looked at his back and her eyes suddenly became dry.

“Not long after Lin Ze left, Ye Zhuo came over with two cups of milk tea. As soon as she walked over, she felt that something was wrong with ye Shu’s expression. “Mom, What’s Wrong?” ”

“Nothing.”Ye Shu quickly reacted.

“Ye Zao handed the milk tea to Ye Shu. “Mom, are you really okay?” ”

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “Look at you asking. What could be wrong with your mom?” ”

“Although ye Shu said so with a smile on her face, ye Zao still felt that something was wrong. “Mom, are you hiding something from me?” ”

“The car is here!”Ye Shu changed the topic at the right time.

“A Volkswagen also happened to stop in front of them, so ye Zao didn’t ask any more questions. ”

The next day arrived in the blink of an eye.

Ye Sen brought Bai Wei to the Ye family as a guest.

“Seeing the car drive to a very ordinary neighborhood, Bai Wei frowned slightly. wasn’t Ye Sen Very Rich? ”

Why did he live in this shabby place?

“Although she was puzzled, she didn’t ask too much. Anyway, she just needed to know that ye Sen was very rich. ”

“In order to leave a good impression on ye Shu today, Bai Wei specially dressed up. She wore a well-fitting fragrance suit and a pair of high heels that were neither tall nor short. ”

She even bought a gift for ye Shu.

She was prepared to make sure nothing went wrong.

“Ye Sen brought Bai Wei to the door of his home. Before knocking on the door, he turned to Bai Wei and said, ”

“”This is my home. Today, my sister and my niece are both at home. Don’t be nervous. They are very easy to get along with.” ”
