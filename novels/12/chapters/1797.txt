“If something were to happen to Li, could she still live? ”

“Naturally, she couldn’t! ”

“Tian Zhifang nodded repeatedly. “Yes! Fortunately, these two children are fine, otherwise...”at the end, Tian Zhifang let out a long sigh. ”

“In this short five days, Tian Zhifang could be considered to have thoroughly experienced the pain of losing her only family! ”

She didn’t want to experience this feeling again!

The two mothers chatted as they looked into the examination room.

“But after an hour and a half, there was no movement in the examination room. ”

“Mother Li was a little anxious. She stood on her tiptoes and looked inside. “Big Sister, why isn’t this person out yet? Is there something wrong with the examination?” ”

Li Xiang and Yu Zifei had stayed in the northern hemisphere for five days. were they infected with the virus?

What if there was no cure!

Li Xiang’s mother was getting more and more worried.

“”It won’t be! There’s definitely no problem!”Tian Zhifang said, “After all, it’s a full body examination. A full body examination won’t be that fast. Don’t let your imagination run wild.” ”

“Actually, Tian Zhifang was also a little anxious, but she couldn’t show it. After all, Li Xiang’s mother was already so anxious. If she was also anxious, wouldn’t Li Xiang’s mother be worried to death? ”

“”You’re a Jinx!”Father Li looked at mother Li. “If you don’t know how to speak, then speak less! Do you wish for your daughter to have some problems?” ”

“Mother Li immediately spat a few times and then said, “It’s fine! Let’s think about it. It’s definitely fine.” ”

“After saying that, mother Li turned to look at Tian Zhifang and continued, “Big sister, don’t worry. Your team leader Yu is also fine! Speaking of which, this team leader Yu still needs to think about leadership! Right, how old is your team leader Yu this year?” ”

“Tian Zhifang smiled and said, “Our family’s son is not 29 this year. What About Your Li?” ”

“”25.”Mother Li smiled and said, “She just graduated from graduate school.” ”

“”Then she’s very powerful,”Tian Zhifang said. ”

“Mother Li said, “Your team leader Yu is still very powerful! Although he’s young, his courage is outstanding! I’ve read all the news reports about your team leader Yu! At that time, not many people were willing to believe in Miss Ye.” ”

“Yu Zifei was also thankful that he followed behind ye Zao. Otherwise, he would not have been able to stand out until now. ”

“”It was Miss Ye who made him who he is,”Tian Zhifang said. ”

It was another small matter. The door of the physical examination room finally opened.

Yu Zifei and Li Xiang walked out from inside.

The Li family’s parents and Tian Zhifang immediately went up to welcome them.

“Think about it. Are You Alright?”

“Is Zifei Alright?”

“Yu Zifei and Li Xiang said in unison, “He’s fine.” ”

“Hearing this, the Li family’s parents and Tian Zhifang both heaved a sigh of relief. ”

It was good that he was fine!

“If he was really infected with some virus on Mars, it would be troublesome! ”

“At this moment, Yu Zifei seemed to have thought of something and continued, “Mom, Where’s My Dad?” ”

“Tian Zhifang said, “Your dad fainted and is still in the waiting room.” ”

“”Fainted?”Yu Zifei was stunned. He continued, “Is he okay?” ”

“”He’s fine. He just hasn’t woken up yet,”Tian Zhifang said. ”

“Father Yu was too worried about Yu Zifei, so he fainted out of anxiety. After checking, he said that he was fine, but he still hadn’t woken up. ”

“Hearing this, father li smiled and said, “Old brother Yu is too weak! He can’t take the blow. Look at me. I’m still fine.” ”

“Mother li sneered, “I don’t know who it is, but he hid in his room in the middle of the night and cried, saying that he didn’t want to live anymore.” ”

He hid in his room in the middle of the night and cried.

“Hearing this, father Li’s face turned red. “It’s not true! You’re talking nonsense!”After saying that, he raised his foot and walked forward. ” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Li Xiang smiled and said, “My father is quite cute.” ”

“After Yu Zifei greeted mother Li and Li Xiang, he went to the lounge to see Father Yu. ”

“Father Yu lay on the bed, his face pale and his left hand clenched into a fist. ”

“Seeing his father like this, Yu Zifei felt very uncomfortable. In his impression, his father’s health had always been good. He had almost never been sick, and he hadn’t even caught a cold once. ”

“But now, his father, who was even stronger than an ox, had actually fainted on the bed because of him. ”

Yu Zifei couldn’t imagine what would happen to his father if he didn’t come back.

“”Dad.”Yu Zifei held father Yu’s hand and half-squatted in front of the bed. “Dad, please wake up. I’m back.” ”

“Tian Zhifang’s eyes were a little red. “His dad, Zifei is back. Our Zifei is back.” ”

“As if he had heard the voices of the two mothers, the unconscious father Yu moved his fingers. ”

“Feeling the movement of his father’s fingers, Yu Zifei quickly said, “Dad, I’m back. Please open your eyes and look at me.” ”
