What is she hiding from me?

“Old Lady Lin had been staying in the ward the whole time. Lin Ze could not ask Lin Jincheng directly about some things, so he suggested that he go back with Old Lady Lin. ”

Lin Jincheng sent the two out of the recovery room.

Old Lady Lin turned to look at Lin Jincheng. “You’re not feeling well. Go back to your room and rest.”

“Okay.”Lin Jincheng nodded.

“Old Mrs. Lin looked at Lin Ze again. “Ah Ze, let’s go back.” ”

“”Okay, Grandma.”Lin Ze followed Old Mrs. Lin’s footsteps. ”

The grandfather and grandson got into the car.

Lin Jincheng looked in the direction the car had disappeared and sighed deeply.

“After returning to the ward, he continued to look at the diary that was already slightly yellowed. ”

“The diary was filled with his memories, but it did not seem like his memories. ”

“He tried hard to remember his face, but in the end, it was indeed a blur of facial features. ”

Could it be...

It was really as the diary had said.

Was that person really Feng Qianhua?

Old Lady Lin’s words floated into his ears again. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“”Jin city, it’s been nineteen years. Qianhua has waited for you for nineteen years. She has given you the best golden years of a woman.” ”

“How many more nineteen years do you want her to wait?”

“”Jincheng, you and Qianhua have been childhood sweethearts since young. Why aren’t you willing to take on the responsibilities that a man should have?” ”

“”I don’t care! For Ah Ze and for Xianxian, you must give Qianhua an explanation!” ”

“Lin Jincheng pressed his temples, his facial features contorted in pain. ”

“Not only did he have a headache, but he also had phantom limb pain. ”

He felt as if his entire body was about to be torn apart by the immense pain.

He could not breathe.

He was like a person who had drowned.

“He struggled desperately in the middle of the abyss, but he still could not be saved. ”

“Bang –”

The teacups on the table were swept to the ground by Lin Jincheng.

“”Director Lin, are you okay?”The bodyguard immediately rushed in from outside the door. “Quickly go and call doctor an.” ”

“Soon, doctor an, who was wearing a white coat, came in and gave Lin Jin Cheng a shot of painkillers. ”

“Lin Jin Cheng’s situation was special. Because he had been taking painkillers all year round, the painkillers did not have any significant effect on him. Therefore, Lin Jin Cheng’s dosage was ten times that of an ordinary person. ”

“Gradually, Lin Jin Cheng’s mood stabilized. ”

“Doctor an helped Lin Jin Cheng to the bed. “Chief Lin, are you alright?” ”

“Cold Sweat broke out on Lin Jin Cheng’s face. He waved his hand and said, “I’m fine.” ”

“Doctor an continued, “Have you taken your medicine on time these few days?” ”

“The assistant beside him said, “Chief Lin has always taken his medicine on time.” ”

“”Then what’s going on?”Doctor an frowned. “If you take your medicine on time, your condition won’t suddenly worsen. Did Something Provoke Chief Lin?” ”

The assistant shook his head.

Lin Jincheng’s hands trembled. He took out a tissue and wiped the sweat off his forehead.

“Seeing him like this, the assistant said, “Boss Lin, let me help you.” ”

“No need.”

“Doctor an continued, “Boss Lin, your condition is much worse than a year ago. Remember to take the medicine on time. Be careful not to let your mood fluctuate too much. If you feel uncomfortable, you must get someone to call me immediately.” ”

Lin Jincheng nodded slightly.

“”Director Lin, if there’s nothing else, I’ll be leaving first.” ”

“”Doctor an, you can go back to your work.” ”

Doctor an walked out of the ward.

“Just as he walked out of the ward, he saw Feng Qianhua. ”

Feng Qianhua walked over to doctor an. “Doctor an.”

“Madam Feng.”Doctor an nodded.

“Feng Qianhua continued, “Doctor An, do you have time now?” ”

“”Ms. Feng, what can I do for You?”Dr. an asked. ”

Feng Qianhua turned to look at the ward. “I’d like to talk to you about CEO Lin’s condition.”

Dr. An was a doctor that the Feng family had specially hired overseas for Lin Jin city.

“Having been in the Lin family for so many years, he naturally knew that Feng Qianhua was already madam Lin’s default daughter-in-law and the future mistress of the Lin family. ”

“Therefore, doctor an was still very respectful to Feng Qianhua. “Madam Feng, this way please.” ”

Feng Qianhua nodded and stepped forward.

She arrived at Doctor An’s office.

“Feng Qianhua took the initiative to ask, “Doctor an, how is President Lin’s health now?” ”

“Doctor an hesitated for a moment before he spoke, “For President Lin, the biggest problem is his mental illness. He still has to be the one to solve it. If he won’t let himself go, even the best medicine in the world won’t be able to save him.” ”

Feng Qianhua nodded.

She had always known that ye Shu held a very important position in Lin Jincheng’s heart.

She was not surprised to hear what doctor an said.
