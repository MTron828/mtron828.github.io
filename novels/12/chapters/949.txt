“If the previous severing of ties was just to scare Cen Yuyan, then this time, CEN Yuyan was really serious. ”

“Very serious, very serious. ”

“Cen Yuyan made mistakes again and again. If she didn’t turn back, then the entire Cen family might be implicated by her. ”

Cen Yuyan was stunned on the other end of the phone.

“From the tone of Old Mrs. Cen’s voice, she could tell that she was serious. ”

“Cen Yuyan said, “Grandma, I already have Zhou Rui’s child now. The Doctor said that I’m an old pregnant woman. If I forcefully abort the abortion, my life will be in danger! Are you going to watch me die first?” ”

Was her life so worthless in Old Mrs. Cen’s eyes?

“If the person who was pregnant today was ye Zhuo, Old Mrs. Cen would definitely be overjoyed. ”

“If it was her who was pregnant, old Mrs. Cen would let her have an abortion. ”

This was the difference.

“”Being pregnant with that gigolo Zhou Rui’s child is truly a life worse than death. Whether you want to have an abortion or keep the name on your household register, you can choose!”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Cen Yuyan, I’ll put my words here today. If you regret it in the future, I won’t even look at you again! From now on, I don’t have a granddaughter like you!” ”

Old Mrs. Cen was really angry.

She had a total of four granddaughters and one grandson.

The three granddaughters in front of her did not make her worry at all.

“However, this youngest granddaughter made her worry so much that she could not distinguish right from wrong. She had said so much to her, but she did not listen to a single word. ”

She was stupid again and again.

“After saying this, old Mrs. Cen hung up the phone angrily. ”

“Mom?”Zhou Xiang turned to look at Old Mrs. Cen.

Old Mrs. Cen covered her heart. “This fourth girl is as stupid as a pig! Calling her a pig is an insult to a pig! I don’t even have words to describe her!”

“After saying that.., old Mrs. Cen patted her chest again and said, “You can’t be angry, you can’t be angry. Yezi said that being angry not only makes you old, but it will also affect the normal functioning of the Qi in your body. Cute Little Girls Like Us never get angry with people who are as stupid as pigs!” ”

“Zhou Xiang’s eyes were red. “Mom, do you think that this fourth girl is really pregnant?” ”

“”Judging from her tone, it’s most likely true.” ”

“Zhou Xiang continued, “Then what should we do?” ”

“”If she doesn’t go to the hospital to abort the child, I will sever my relationship with her!” ”

“After all, she was her own daughter. Now that Cen Yuyan had become like this, Zhou Xiang was really very sad. They said that one step was wrong, and Cen Yuyan really couldn’t continue to make mistakes. ”

“If she continued like this, there would be no chance for her to turn back. ”

Zhou Xiang took a deep breath. “I’ll go and talk to that child properly.”

Old Mrs. Cen did not say anything and did not stop her.

“If Zhou Xiang could make Cen Yuyan turn back, it would be the best thing that could happen. ”

“Seeing that Zhou Xiang’s figure had already walked out of the main door, old Mrs. Cen continued, “Xiangxiang, wait a moment.” ”

“”Mom, What’s Wrong?”Zhou Xiang turned around. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Call the eldest girl, second girl, and third girl over. After all, they are sisters. If she can’t listen to you, she should listen to the three sisters.” ”

“”Okay, Mom.”Zhou Xiang nodded. ”

The Three Sisters of the Cen family came very quickly.

“After all, Cen Yuyan was their youngest sister. ”

“Now that they heard that Cen Yuyan was actually pregnant with Zhou Rui’s child, the three sisters were also very surprised. ”

“Who would have thought that in just a month’s time, Cen Yuyan was actually pregnant with Zhou Rui’s child! ”

“Seeing Zhou Xiang and the three sisters come out, Cen Yuyan’s eyes flashed with a bright light. ”

She knew that her family would not give up on her.

“No matter what, she was still the Cen family’s fourth miss. ”

“Zhou Rui’s eyes lit up as well. He immediately held Cen Yuyan’s hand and walked forward. “Auntie, eldest sister, second sister, and third sister.” ”

Zhou Xiang did not say anything.

Cen Yuying reached out and pulled Cen Yuyan over. “You’re Pregnant?”

“Yes.”Cen Yuyan nodded. “I’m Pregnant!”

“Cen Yuying slapped Cen Yuyan. “You’re not ashamed of being pregnant with the child of such a person, but instead you’re proud of it, right?” ”

Cen Yuyan was stunned. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“How could she have thought that Cen Yuying, who had always been gentle and gentle, would slap her? ”

“Moreover, she was pregnant! ”

“”Big Sister!”Zhou Rui immediately stood in front of Cen Yuyan. “This is all my fault, it has nothing to do with Yuyan! If you want to hit me, then hit me!” ”

“”Who’s your big sister! If you want to be my brother-in-law, why don’t you take a look in the mirror to see if you’re qualified!”Cen Yuying directly waved away Zhou Rui’s hand. ”
