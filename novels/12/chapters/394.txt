“Chapter 395: 116: face-smacking, secret exposed. So, Old Mrs. Cen is fifth Cen’s grandmother! 5”

Translator: 549690339

“Ever since he met ye Zao, Cen Shaoqing had changed too much! ”

He no longer smoked!

His phone case had also changed!

It seemed that the day when she would hold her great-grandchild was not far away.

“The more old Mrs. Cen thought about it, the happier she became. ”

Li Qiandong looked at old Mrs. Cen in surprise. “You also discovered it?”

“Old Madam Cen said speechlessly, “I’m not blind! Of course I could see it!” ”

“Li Qiandong sighed. “Even you could see it, but fifth brother is still lying to himself...”he clearly liked mu yourong, yet he still pretended to not like her. He even wanted to hurt her to attract her attention! ”

Cen Shaoqing was really too muddle-headed!

“Old Madam Cen smiled and said, “Isn’t there a saying that those in the middle are the ones who are muddle-headed? I think Shaoqing is the one in the middle who is muddle-headed!” ”

“So you also agree that they should be together?”

“Old Madam Cen nodded, her eyes filled with satisfaction. “I agree! Of course I agree!” ”

Li Qiandong could see that old madam Cen was really very satisfied with Mu Yourong and could not help but heave a sigh of relief.

“As long as Old Madam Cen was also satisfied with Mu Yourong, then this matter would be easy to handle! ” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Li Qiandong continued, “Old madam, now that something has happened to the Mu family, Miss Mu can no longer wait! “Since you like Miss Mu so much, why don’t you make the decision to resume fifth brother’s engagement with Miss Mu! “Fifth brother is not young this year either. Let them hold the wedding as soon as possible!” ”

“Although he liked mu yourong very much, he was still a gentleman. ”

A gentleman would not take away a person’s interests.

Only when he saw Mu Yourong and Cen Shaoqing hold their wedding could he completely give up.

“Hearing this, Old Madam Cen immediately flew into a rage. She slammed the table and stood up. ”

“What did you say?”

Li Qiandong was startled. He did not quite understand why old madam Cen had such a big reaction and repeated what she had just said.

“”I think your head has been kicked by a donkey, right? How can she be worthy of our Shaoqing with that kind of trash?”Old Lady Cen was so angry at Li Qiandong that she placed her hands on her hips, she cursed, “You even want to resume the engagement? Where did you get such a big face? You Son of a bitch! Our Shaoqing treats you so well, yet you hurt him like this! Are you worthy of Shaoqing?” ”

Li Qiandong was dumbfounded by old lady Cen’s scolding.

Didn’t Old Lady Cen Like Mu Yourong Just Now?

Why did she change her face just like that?

“After a while, he finally reacted, “Old Lady, you’ve Misunderstood Me! I didn’t harm fifth brother, I was doing it for his own good! Miss Mu is really very kind! She’s a rare good girl!” ”

Good Girl?

Even Mu Yourong could be considered a good girl?

Old Madam Cen felt like she was about to have a heart attack from Li Qiandong’s anger!

“”You can shut up! Your words are worse than farts! If you don’t know how to speak, then don’t speak! I’m just wondering, Li Jianjun and Li Weiguo are both smart people, how did your old Li family produce such a fool! A fool!” ”

“Li Jianjun was Li Qiandong’s grandfather, while Li Weiguo was Li Qiandong’s father. ”

“As soon as he finished speaking, old madam CEN continued, “For a shameless person like Mu Yourong, our Cen family won’t accept her even if she comes knocking on our door! If you want to marry into our Cen family, forget about the next life! You Won’t even have the chance to marry into the next life!” ”

“Seeing Old Madam Cen misunderstanding mu Yourong like this, Li Qiandong was really very sad. ”

He didn’t know what Cen Shaoqing had said in front of old Madam Cen.

“As one grows old, it is inevitable that one will become somewhat muddle-headed! ”

Sigh!

To think that he used to think that old lady cen was a reasonable person.

“Now, it seemed that Old Lady Cen was simply blind. ”

“Li Qiandong tried his best to control his emotions, “Old Lady, actually, the matter of the annulment of the marriage was just a misunderstanding. Miss Mu is truly an exceptionally good girl. In this world, other than her, no other woman can match up to fifth brother!” ”

“Old Madam Cen was already very angry, but when she heard these words, she became even angrier, “My granddaughter-in-law, Yezi, is many times more outstanding than Mu Yourong! Mu Yourong doesn’t even have the right to carry my granddaughter-in-law’s shoes! I think you’re blind! You Son of a bitch, you’re really pissing me off! Hurry up and apologize to me, or I won’t forgive you!” ”

“Because of the incident in the Middle East, old Mrs. Cen didn’t want to argue with Li Qiandong. ”

“”Yezi?”Li Qiandong narrowed his eyes. “Old Mrs. Cen, are you talking about ye Zao?” ”

“At the mention of Ye Zao, old Mrs. Cen calmed down a little. “Yes! That’s right! Yezi is my granddaughter-in-law! You know my granddaughter-in-law too?” ”

So that’s how it was!

No wonder Cen Shaoqing wanted to pin the matter of the race car on Ye Zao.
