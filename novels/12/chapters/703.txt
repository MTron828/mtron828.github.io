“Zhou Xiang might have been too well-protected at home, but she was very simple-minded. Therefore, Zhou Xiang did not care much about the Cen family’s big and small matters, and it was the Cen old lady who took care of them. ”

“Zhou Xiang was not angry at being called stupid by the Cen Old Lady. She smiled and said, “Don’t worry, I know! Not to mention you, I have long treated searing flames as my own daughter-in-law. In My Heart, no one can replace her.” ”

Old Mrs. Cen nodded in satisfaction.

“Fortunately, Zhou Xiang was a clear-minded person. Otherwise, with Cen Yuyan, the Cen family would definitely be in chaos. ”

“After cutting the window flowers, Old Mrs. Cen, Zhou Xiang, and the servants went to paste them. ”

“When the two passed by Cen Shaoqing’s room, Zhou Xiang asked curiously, “Mom, what do you think Shaoqing is doing in his room?” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen said, “He’s most likely practicing window cutting!” ”

“Are you that sure?”Zhou Xiang asked in surprise.

“Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “If you don’t believe me, you can just knock on the door and find out.” ”

Zhou Xiang reached out to knock on the door.

“Soon, CEN Shaoqing came over to open the door. “Mom, What’s the matter?” ”

“Seeing Cen Shaoqing holding the red paper in his left hand and the scissors in his right hand, Zhou Xiang had an answer in her heart. She smiled and said, “Do you have anything you want to eat for the New Year’s Eve Dinner Tonight?” ”

“”I can eat anything.”In the past, when Cen Shaoqing was a vegetarian, he only ate some vegetable leaves every day. ”

“Although Cen Shaoqing was not afraid of meat and vegetables now, he still did not have high requirements for food. ”

“As far as he was concerned, as long as he could fill his stomach, it was enough. ”

“”Okay, I got it.”Zhou Xiang nodded. ”

“Coming out of Cen Shaoqing’s room, Zhou Xiang came to the side of old Mrs. Cen with a face full of excitement. He smiled and said, “Mom, you really hit the nail on the head. Shaoqing is cutting window flowers inside!” ”

“Old Lady Cen said with a proud face, “That’s right! How can a half-immortal like me be lying? I think this rascal is practicing cutting the window flowers, trying to win Ye Zi’s favor!” ”

Zhou Xiang nodded. “I think what you said makes a lot of sense.” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

All the men in the CEN family were infatuated with each other.

“It was fine if they were not enlightened, but once they were enlightened, they would stay together until death. ”

...

“In a short while, the sky turned dark. ”

The New Year’s Eve dinner officially began.

“Because it was a reunion dinner, the Lin family did not have separate tables for tonight. Lin Jincheng and a few of the Lin brothers moved out the big table in the warehouse. ”

This table was specially customized and could accommodate more than thirty people.

The four sisters-in-law of the Lin family and their daughter-in-law worked all afternoon and cooked a big table full of dishes.

“This table had been modified by ye Zao to control the temperature. No matter how long the food was on the table, it would not get cold. ”

“After the food was set up, Lin Ze and his cousins went to the West Courtyard to invite Old Lady Lin over for dinner. ”

“Old Lady Lin sat at the head of the table and looked at the big family. Although she was very happy, she still felt somewhat regretful. ”

Everyone was here.

It was a pity.

Feng Qianxian was missing.

She didn’t know what Feng Qianxian was doing at this moment.

“Today was the reunion night, and Feng Qianxian was alone. ”

“Thinking of this, Old Lady Lin felt very uncomfortable. ”

Old Lady Lin’s gaze inadvertently shifted to ye Sen. It was a lie to say that she was not angry at all.

“Lin Jincheng didn’t allow her to call Feng Qianxian over, but she called Ye Sen, a foreigner, over. ”

“If it was not the New Year’s Eve today, Old Mrs. Lin would have wanted to flip the table! ”

“Ye Sen was a foreigner, what right did he have to come to the Lin family for the New Year? ”

“The more old Mrs. Lin thought about it, the angrier she got. A mouthful of blood stuck in her heart, and she almost could not breathe. ”

“When the New Year’s Eve dinner began, the younger generation in the family stood up to Toast Old Mrs. Lin. ”

“Looking at the faces of her children and grandchildren, the anger in Old Mrs. Lin’s heart dissipated a little. ”

“After the toast, the New Year’s Eve dinner officially began. ”

“There were many people in the Lin family, so everyone spoke one after another. It was very lively. ”

“At this moment, ye Zao’s phone rang. ”

Ye Zao opened his phone.

It was a wechat message from CEN Shaoqing. [[ photo jpg ] we are starting to eat. ]

The photo was of the CEN family’s New Year’s Eve dinner.

There was a table full of dishes and ye Zao’s favorite dessert.

Ye Zao also took out his phone and took a photo of CEN Shaoqing. [[ photo jpg ] we have just started. ]

Cen Shaoqing looked at the photo sent by Ye Zao and smiled.

“In the past, he never understood why some people would hold their phones and giggle. ”

Now he finally understood.

“As long as ye Zao talked to him, he could hold his phone and giggle all day. ”
