“Now was the important moment of the autumn flute election. If they were to have a dispute with Granny Fei at this time, the impact would definitely be bad! ”

They still had to do the superficial work.

“Hearing this, the guards immediately apologized, “Old lady, it’s our fault. I’m sorry...” ”

“I want to see Ye Lan.”Granny Fei raised her head to look at Zhou Qing.

“Zhou Qing smiled and said, “Come with me.” ”

Granny Fei immediately followed Zhou Qing’s footsteps.

The two of them arrived at Ye Lan’s office.

Zhou Qing knocked on the door. “Miss Ye!” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Miss Ye?”Granny Fei looked at Zhou Qing. “What kind of Miss Ye is she!”

“Zhou Qing immediately changed his words. “Yes, yes, yes. Old Lady, I was wrong! It should be second Miss Ye!” ”

Only then was Grandma Fei satisfied.

“In a moment, the door came from the inside. ”

It was ye Lan who opened the door.

“Seeing the person standing outside the door, Ye Lan was stunned. “Zhou Qing, why are you...” ”

“Before ye Lan could finish her sentence, Grandma Fei interrupted her. “You go out first. I have something to say to her.” ”

“Okay.”Zhou Qing nodded and turned to walk out of the door.

“As soon as Zhou Qing left, Granny Fei closed the office door. ”

“Ye Lan smiled and said, “Granny Fei, do you have something to say to me?” ”

“Granny Fei looked at Ye Lan. “Ye Lan, you’re considered a child that I’ve watched grow up. How did you become like this?”Granny Fei was heartbroken! Heartbroken! ”

Ye Lan was so obedient and sensible when she was young.

And Now?

“If she didn’t see it with her own eyes, Grandma Fei wouldn’t even dare to believe it was true. ”

“What did I do?”Ye Lan looked at Grandma Fei. “What did I do? Why are you blaming me like this!”

“If Grandma Fei hadn’t helped her when she was young, she would have kicked this old thing out long ago! ”

“Grandma Fei said, “Let me ask you, why did you betray burning! Burning was your sister! She was so good to you! Why did you betray her! What’s the difference between what you did and being an ingrate?” ”

Good?

“When everyone judged her relationship with Ye Zao, they would say, ‘Ye Zao was so good to you!”didn’t ye Zao have the current you?’ ”

But was ye Zao really good to her?

Ye Zao was just using her!

“”Good?”Ye Lan looked at Grandma Fei with tears in her eyes, “Every one of you said that! Every one of you will only blame me! Do you know what ye Zao did to me? She stopped me from recognizing my biological parents! She is simply a wicked woman with a wicked heart!” ”

“You! What are you talking about!”Grandma Fei was so angry that her whole body was shaking. “Zao is even closer to you than his own sister! This is how you treat her!”

“”My own sister?”Ye Lan asked back, “If she really treated me as her own sister, would I be like this now? Do you think I want to do this! I just want to reunite with my family!” ”

“”Reunite with your family?”Grandma Fei continued, “Do you know what kind of people your family is? Your father, Zuo Shunguo, was a chronic alcoholic who sold his daughter for Glory. Your Mother, Sun Manyi, was subjected to domestic violence all year round. When you were three years old, she could not bear it anymore and took you away from home! Who knew that an accident would happen along the way? Your mother met with a tragic accident and died tragically. Before she died, she entrusted you to a fellow countryman. After your mother died, the fellow countryman took away what little money your mother had left and left! From then on, you became a homeless orphan girl! If you had not met burning when you were 12 years old, you would still be a homeless orphan girl! Oh, you might also be like that second sister of yours. Your father would find you and sell you into the Little Red Mansion! From then on, you would sell yourself for a living!” ”

What kind of place was the Little Red Mansion?

It was a paradise for men to enjoy themselves.

A hell for Women!

“”No! Impossible! My father is not some drunkard who sells women for Glory!”Ye Lan looked at Granny Fei, “You’re talking nonsense! Don’t think I don’t know! You just want to clear ye Zhuo’s name!” ”

Did she really think she was a fool!

She was clearly the princess of Manxing Kingdom!

“Granny Fei looked at Ye Lan, “I’m not talking nonsense. Your father is Zuo Shunguo. Your real name is Zuo Sisi. The reason why burning didn’t tell you all this was because he didn’t want you to feel pressured and burdened. He also didn’t want your identity to be publicly criticized! “When you were investigating your identity, your father also found you. In order to prevent you from repeating your sister’s fate, burning helped you solve this problem! “Burning blocked everything for you alone, but you actually repaid kindness with enmity! Ye Lan! You in the end have no conscience!” ”
