Translator: 549690339

To let a person with mental illness become the head of the Guang family was somewhat worrisome.

“Furthermore, Guang Xing had been locked in the basement for five years. Did he really have the ability to do so? ”

“Ye Zhuo knew what the second patriarch meant and continued, “Don’t worry. Although Guang Xing was previously stimulated, his ability is definitely not a problem. Now that he has returned to normal, you don’t have to worry about this problem.” ”

“Hearing what ye Zhuo said, the second clan leader let out a sigh of relief: “Alright Miss Ye, I understand.” ”

“Ye Zhuo continued: “But Guang Xing is still young after all, there are some places that you clan leaders still need to take care of. Although he and Guang Youdao are father and son, they are definitely not the same type of people.” ”

“”You don’t have to worry about this.”The second clan leader nodded, “We will definitely not confuse him with Guang Youdao.” ”

“Mm.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

...

On the other side.

Zhao Dan walked all the way to the aircraft’s lounge.

“Seeing him like this, the assistant asked worriedly, “Madam, are you alright?” ”

“Zhao Dan pressed his temples and shook his head, “I’m fine.” ”

“I’ll go make a cup of tea for you to drink.”The assistant said.

“Alright.”Zhao Dan said.

“In manxing country, only Zhao Dan had the habit of drinking tea. ”

“This tea was brought back from Earth and successfully cultivated in Manxing country. Although the taste was much worse than on Earth, it was better than nothing. ”

“Soon, the assistant made a cup of tea. ”

Zhao Dan drank a mouthful of tea.

It was very bitter.

“If it were any other time, she would definitely eat a candy immediately. But today, she seemed to have lost her sense of taste and could not feel the bitterness of the tea at all. ”

She could not even react to the scalding heat of the tea.

The assistant was a little stunned by this scene.

“A moment later, Zhao Dan put down the Teacup, looked at her assistant, and said, “You can go out first.” ”

“The assistant looked at Zhao Dan and asked worriedly, “Are you really alright?” ”

“”I’m really alright,”Zhao Dan said. “You should go out quickly.” ”

“Alright.”The assistant nodded and walked out.

“Zhao Dan sat there, thinking about something. Her mind was in a daze. In a moment, she turned on her communication device and connected to Manjiang Mountain. ”

Manjiang mountain was the president of Manxing country.

“After a long time, the transparent screen in the air showed the figures of Manjiang Mountain. ”

“What’s Wrong?”Manjiang mountain looked at Zhao Dan.

“Zhao Dan was still in shock. “Jiangshan, I, I...”He couldn’t say the rest of his words. ” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“”I’m very busy now. If you don’t have anything else to do, let’s do this first. I’ll talk about it after I finish what I’m doing,”said man Jiangshan. ”

“”I have something to do. I have something very important to do! Don’t Hang Up!”Zhao Dan swallowed his throat and looked at man Jiangshan. “Jiangshan, do you know who I saw today?” ”

“”Who you saw, what does it have to do with me?”Man Jiangshan continued, “Is the matter of Changyue settled?” ”

“”No.”Zhao Dan shook his head and continued, “Ye, Ye Zhuo has returned.” ”

“Hearing this, man Jiangshan frowned slightly, “Didn’t you say he was dead?” ”

“Although the news of ye Zhuo’s death had not been made public, man Xing country still knew some news. ”

“When they heard that ye Zao was alive again, man Jiangshan was still a little surprised. ”

But he was only surprised!

“Zhao Dan said, “She said she was dead before, but now she’s Back!” ”

“Man Jiangshan frowned slightly. “So, you contacted me because of this?” ”

What did it have to do with him whether ye Zao was alive or dead?

“Have you seen ye Zao?”Zhao Dan asked.

“”Can you just tell me directly if you have something to say?”Man Jiangshan said impatiently, “I don’t have time to beat around the bush with you here.” ”

“Zhao Dan immediately opened his AI’s memory. “Look, this is ye Zao.” ”

“As soon as he said that, Ye Zao’s photo appeared on the screen. ”

“In the photo, ye Zao smiled and extended his hand to Zhao Dan. ”

“The girl’s eyebrows were as clear as a painting, her eyes were bright and her teeth were white. Her facial features were beautiful and alluring, graceful and graceful. ”

“When he saw the photo, man Jiangshan was stunned. ”

Because the girl in the photo reminded him of his daughter who had been missing for many years.

“After a long while, man Jiangshan finally calmed himself down and asked,”... who do you think this is?” ”

“”Ye Zhuo,”Zhao Dan answered. ”

Ye Zhuo...

“Man Jiangshan narrowed his eyes. Three years ago, Ye Zhuo was famous throughout the s galaxy, and he had single-handedly pacified changyue. ”

“In the past, when the Chang Yue country was bombarded with artillery, the small countries around the s galaxy all wanted a piece of the pie until ye Zao appeared. ”

“Man Jiangshan had always been very curious about this miss ye whom he had never met before. When the news of ye Zao’s death spread through the Chang Yue country, he had felt quite regretful. He had never thought that ye Zao would look like this. ”
