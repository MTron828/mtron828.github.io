Xia Xiaoman called a car on her phone app.

“Soon, the car stopped at the entrance of the hospital.”

“After the Doctor’s appraisal, Lin Qingxuan’s injuries were all superficial. She only needed to use some medicinal wine to treat her injuries. The only wound on her arm was a little deep and needed a few stitches.”

Xia Xiaoman frowned. “The injury is already so deep. Why do you keep saying that it’s nothing?”

“Lin qingxuan smiled and said, “It’s really nothing. The Doctor is making a big fuss out of nothing.”In fact, he was afraid that Xia Xiaoman would feel too guilty. Besides, he was a man. It was not a big deal for him to be injured.”

“The doctor came over with a syringe. “Sir, this is not making a big deal out of nothing. If your wound is not properly treated, it might get infected! If it really gets infected, then the problem will be huge!”” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Lin Qingxuan smiled and looked up. “Doctor, are you going to inject me with an anesthetic?””

The doctor nodded. “Yes.”

“Lin qingxuan continued, “Injecting an anesthetic will affect the healing of the wound, right?””

“The doctor squeezed out the excess air from the syringe. “It will more or less have an effect, but it doesn’t matter. There isn’t much anesthetic used and it will be metabolized soon.””

“Lin Qingxuan shook his head. “Doctor, just sew it up. I don’t need anesthetic.””

“The Doctor was stunned. He had worked for so long, but this was the first time he had seen a patient ask for such a request.”

No anesthetic?

“”If you don’t sew it up, it will be very painful when you sew it up. Have you thought it through?”The Doctor asked.”

Lin Qingxuan nodded. “I’ve thought it through.”

“Mr. Lin?”Xia Xiaoman was also shocked.

“Lin qingxuan smiled and said, “It’s okay. I’ve Never Been Afraid of pain since I was young. Come on, doctor.””

The Doctor confirmed with Lin Qingxuan again before he started to stitch Lin Qingxuan up.

The Doctor thought that Lin Qingxuan would be in so much pain that he would struggle to avoid it.

“But from the beginning to the end, Lin Qingxuan did not make a sound.”

“However, her face was covered in layers of cold sweat.”

“Seeing this scene, Xia Xiaoman gulped.”

This was the first time she had seen someone like Lin Qingxuan.

“When one sees injustice on the road, one’s perseverance is strong.”

Even the way she looked at Lin Qingxuan was different. She initially thought that Lin Qingxuan was just trying to make a fool out of herself. She did not expect that Lin Qingxuan really had such perseverance!

Amazing!

She was really too amazing!

“After the stitches were done.., the doctor continued, “For the next three days, it’s best that the wound does not touch water. After that, it’s forbidden to eat spicy food. After three days, come to the hospital to remove the stitches. This is the list. You guys take the list and go to the first floor to pay the bill. After that, go to the pharmacy to get the medicine.””

“”Okay.”Xia Xiaoman took the list. “Thank you, Doctor.””

“Lin Qingxuan was injured because of her. Of course, she had to do these things.”

“The doctor smiled and said, “You’re welcome.””

“The two of them went to the first floor’s pay window to queue up to pay the bill. Xia Xiaoman turned to look at Lin Qingxuan. “Mr. Lin, go there and rest for a while. I’ll call you after I get the medicine.””

“Lin Qingxuan said, “No need. I’ll go with you.””

There was a long line at the first floor’s pay window.

Xia Xiaoman stood at the front while Lin Qingxuan stood at the back.

“In all these years, Lin Qingxuan had only interacted with Zhao shuning. Even though he was separated from Zhao shuning, he still maintained his old habits. This was the first time he had been in close contact with the opposite sex for such a long time.”

It felt a little strange.

“After waiting in line to pay the bill and taking the medicine, the two of them came out of the hospital.”

“Xia Xiaoman continued, “Mr. Lin, thank you so much for today! If it weren’t for you, I Might...”the rest of her words were self-evident.”

“After all, in front of those five strong men, Xia Xiaoman was just a powerless woman.”

“Lin qingxuan smiled and said, “It’s a small matter. You Don’t have to take it to heart. I believe that no matter who encounters this scene today, they will not sit idly by.””

“”No matter what, I have to thank you properly!”At this point, Xia Xiaoman bowed deeply to Lin Qingxuan.”

“Lin Qingxuan immediately helped Xia Xiaoman up, “Madam Xia, please don’t Be Like This! To tell you the truth, I also encountered a terrible incident today. Initially, I was still feeling stifled. After fighting with that group of people, I felt much better!””

Lin Qingxuan was not lying.

“When he left the Lin family, he was indeed very upset.”

“But now, those bad feelings had disappeared without a trace.”

“Xia Xiaoman continued, “Mr. Lin, my name is Xia Xiaoman. You saved my life. Just call me by my name from now on.””
