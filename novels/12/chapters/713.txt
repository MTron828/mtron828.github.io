“CEN yueying continued, “Grandma, I’m telling the truth. It’s true that Zhuozhu is my sister-in-law, but Zhuozhu isn’t omnipotent. No one is perfect, so it’s normal that she doesn’t know how to throw darts. However, although Zhuozhu doesn’t know how to throw darts, she’s amazing in other aspects!””

“Old Mrs. Cen was still a little unhappy, “So what if she knows how to Dart? She’s not doing her job properly! Our family’s Yezi knows medicine, can program, can assemble robots, and is also the boss of a media company. Does that ugly fish know how to do it? “What does she have to be proud of? “In any case, Yezi is omnipotent in my heart!””

“Cen yueying smiled and patted old Mrs. Cen’s shoulder. “Alright, Grandma, don’t be angry.””

Old Madam Cen was still very angry.

“Cen Yuyan, on the other hand, looked very appeased.”

Song Chenyu had finally managed to turn the tables around.

However.

This was not enough.

It was far from enough!

The good show had just begun!

Song Chenyu still had a lot of ways to crush ye Zao.

“The more Cen Yuyan thought about it, the happier she became. She raised her head and looked at ye Zao. “Zao Zao, if you want to play darts, you can let Chenyu teach you. Chenyu is a very responsible teacher.””

“Song Chenyu picked up a dart and looked up at Ye Zao. She spoke softly, “As long as Miss Ye doesn’t mind, I can share some tips with Miss Ye. Actually, darts aren’t very suitable for girls to play with. They’re too sharp. If you’re not careful, you’ll easily hurt yourself.””

A delicate flower like ye Zao was definitely not suitable to play with darts!

Ye Zao was like a dodder flower that needed to attach itself to.

All of her strengths were like those female stars in the entertainment industry who deliberately set themselves up. All of them were concave!

This was not the real ye Zao.

“Once she encountered practical problems, Ye Zao could only turn into a dodder flower.”

Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly.

“Ye Zao pinched Cen Shaoqing’s hand with one hand and picked up a few more darts with the other. He raised his chin slightly, and his eyes were filled with light. He looked at song Chenyu and said, “Then I’ll be counting on Miss Song’s guidance!””

“Her gaze was clearly on song Chenyu, but the darts in her hand were thrown onto the dart board at this time.”

“It was a very casual action, but it revealed a biting cold aura.”

It made people not dare to look directly at it.

Clap Clap Clap!

“At this moment, all six darts hit the dart board. One of them hit the bull’s-eye and even lined up in a straight line!”

It was extremely shocking!

Clang.

“Song Chenyu’s darts that hit the bull’s-Eye were squeezed to the ground, making a crisp sound.”

Everyone was stunned when they saw this scene.

No one expected ye Zao to be so powerful.

There was a total of six darts.

“If only one darts hit the bull’s-eye, it could be said to be a coincidence.”

But now.

Six darts hit the bull’s-eye and were arranged so neatly.

If it were an ordinary person...

Would it work?

Cen Yuyan was stunned. She rubbed her eyes in disbelief.

“No, she wasn’t seeing things.”

“Indeed, the six darts had all hit the bull’s-eye.”

And they were arranged very neatly.

This was too unbelievable!

How could ye Zhuo be so powerful?

Cen Yuyan didn’t react for a long time.

“Clap Clap Clap!”Old Madam Cen was the first to clap. “Good!”

The others also clapped.

“Old Mrs. Cen clapped as she looked at Cen Yueying and said with a proud face, “Third girl, is my granddaughter-in-law awesome?””

“Awesome!”Cen Yueying was also shocked.

“She didn’t expect ye Zao to have such skills. Cen Yueying looked at Old Mrs. Cen, she teased, “But Grandma, your face-changing speed is too fast. Just now, you said that playing darts is not doing your job properly! How did it become awesome when it comes to Zao Zao? Grandma, aren’t You a little double standard?””

“”Can that ugly fish compare to my granddaughter-in-law?”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Besides, my granddaughter-in-law can hit six darts at once. Can that ugly fish do it?””

“Cen yueying smiled and sighed, “I really didn’t expect that burning’s skills were so good. Shaoqing has really picked up a treasure now.””

“”It’s clearly my good taste. What does it have to do with that Brat?”Old Mrs. Cen looked at Cen Yueying, then she said, “If it weren’t for me, a good grandma from China, do you think that Brat would have such good luck?””

“Back then, she had chosen ye Zhuo with one look in the crowd.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“At this moment, Old Mrs. Cen was more and more glad that she had chosen to stay in the cloud capital.”

“If they had left the cloud capital at that time, they would not have met such an outstanding granddaughter-in-law.”
