Zhou Cui Hua thought about it and then nodded. “Okay.”

“Boss Wang said it sincerely. If she still refused, it would seem a little pretentious! After all, she wasn’t some young lady anymore. ”

Some things had to be faced.

“Seeing that Zhou Cui Hua finally agreed, boss Wang was very happy. “That’s great, Cui Hua. Then let’s leave now.” ”

“Zhou cuihua said, “I’ll pack up my things.” ”

“Boss Wang said, “There’s no need to pack up. I have everything there.” ”

“In order to show that she was a good woman who was diligent and Thrifty, Zhou cuihua continued, “I’m used to using my own things. Besides, I don’t want to spend your money.” ”

“”My Money is your money,”boss Wang said. ”

“Zhou cuihua said a little embarrassedly, “It’s easy to squander, but it’s hard to start a family. We can’t waste it.” ”

“”Yes.”Boss Wang nodded and continued, “Cuihua, you’re really a good woman!” ”

“Zhou cuihua said, “Being diligent and thrifty is the virtue of our Chinese people.” ”

“After tidying up some clothes, Zhou Cuihua followed boss Wang to the lookout pavilion courtyard. ”

There were a total of ten servants and a butler in the small house.

“Boss Wang said in front of the butler and servants, “From now on, this is the wife of the family. You all just listen to the orders of the wife. Butler, take everyone and introduce yourself to the wife.” ”

“Zhou cuihua stood in front of the servants, her eyes full of superiority. ”

She never thought that this day would come so quickly.

“Xia Xiaoman, Ah Xia Xiaoman, she finally beat Xia Xiaoman! ”

“At this moment, Zhou Cuihua wanted to laugh three times! ”

“In the evening, Zhou Cuihua told Li hang the good news through wechat. ”

Li hang was also very surprised when he heard this and immediately dialed Zhou Cuihua’s voice call.

“”Mom, are you sure you’ve moved to Uncle Wang’s House?” ”

“”Of course it’s true. If you don’t believe me, I’ll take a photo for you to see in a while.”Zhou Cuihua’s mouth was full of smiles. “Your uncle Wang is really nothing to say. He’s many times better than your father!” ”

“Speaking up to this point, Zhou cuihua continued, “Oh right, your uncle Zhou even asked about you today! He said that it’s not lively at all without a child at home. He asked when you would move over.” ”

“Li hang said, “I’ll think about it.” ”

“She did not know what was going on with Zhou Cuihua and boss Wang, so she naturally did not dare to make the decision to move over. ”

“Furthermore, moving out from Li Dalong’s household register was not a small matter, so she had to think about it carefully. ”

“Zhou cuihua said, “If you want to think about it, that’s up to you. But Hang Hang, I want to tell you one thing, don’t regret it. Your Uncle Wang and I still have conditions. If I’m like Xia Xiaoman, then don’t blame mom for not caring about mother and daughter.”At that time, the Wang family would no longer have Li Hang’s position. ”

“Hearing this, Li Hang’s heart immediately became vigilant. “Mom, this isn’t a small matter. You have to let me think about it. You and my uncle Wang add up to almost a hundred years old. Don’t mess around!” ”

“Then make a decision quickly!”Zhou cuihua said.

“Li hang continued, “Mom, don’t be anxious. Give me time to think about it.” ”

“”It’s up to you. Anyway, I’ve already delivered the message to you.”After saying that, Zhou cuihua directly hung up the phone. ”

“Coincidentally, just as she hung up the phone, there was a knock on the door. ”

“”Come in,”Zhou Cuihua said. ”

“The next second, boss Wang pushed the door open and entered. ”

“Zhengxuan.”

“Boss Wang smiled and said, “Cuihua, how’s your discussion with Hang Hang? My mother and I have already agreed that hang hang will be staying in the bedroom on the third floor.” ”

“Zhou cuihua said, “I’ve already told Hang Hang. That child said that he has to rely on himself and doesn’t want to rely on his family.” ”

“”I can’t tell that Hang Hang is still a good and ambitious child,”boss Wang continued, “Young people nowadays all have their own ideas. How about this, you make an appointment with hang hang and we’ll find some time tomorrow to have a face-to-face talk.” ”

“Okay.”Zhou Cui Hua nodded.

“After saying that, Zhou cui hua continued, “Zhengxuan, thank you.” ”

“Boss Wang smiled and said, “Thank me for what?” ”

“”Thank you for being so good to US mother and daughter,”Zhou Cui Hua said. ”

She had never dreamed that she would have such a day.

The feeling of being a rich lady was really great!

“Boss Wang smiled and said, “We’re all family. Cui Hua, you don’t have to be so polite.” ”

“After saying that, boss Wang continued, “Then that’s settled. I’ll go back to my room first. You should rest early. If you need anything, just look for the Butler.” ”

“Okay.”Zhou cuihua nodded.

Boss Wang walked to his room.

Zhou cuihua looked at boss Wang’s back and the corners of her mouth unconsciously curled up.

“Then, Zhou cuihua called Li Hang again and told boss Wang, “Hang Hang, I’m warning you. If you don’t want to lose to that Little B * Tch, an Lizi, take advantage of this opportunity.” ”

“”Got it,”Li Hang said. ”

“After saying that, Zhou cuihua seemed to have thought of something and continued, “Oh right, how’s the detective’s investigation going? Did he call you?” ”

Li Hang was stunned. “What detective?”

It had been too long. She had really forgotten about this matter.

“Zhou cuihua continued, “The detective who investigated Xiao Man.” ”

“Although she had married into a wealthy family, she had no intention of letting Xia Xiaoman go. She wanted Xia Xiaoman to become a concubine! She would be abandoned by Lin Qingxuan! ”

“At that time, Xia Xiaoman would have to look up to her! ” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Li hang finally reacted and continued, “Didn’t the detective leave your phone number? Why did he contact me?” ”

“Zhou cuihua said, “He didn’t contact me. I thought he had contacted you! It’s been half a month, and I should have found something!” ”

“”If he didn’t contact you, he definitely hasn’t found anything,”li hang continued, “Mom, if you’re free, go to the detective agency to take a look.” ”

“Just like Zhou cuihua, Li Hang couldn’t bear to see an Lizi live a good life. ”

She couldn’t wait for Lin Qingxuan to kick an lizi out of the house immediately.

“Zhou cuihua said, “I should go and take a look if I have time.” ”

“After the mother and daughter hung up, Li Hang began to seriously consider Zhou Cuihua’s words. ”

This matter was a huge turn of events for her. She had to grasp it well and not let it slip by.

“Because once something was missed, there was no room for regret. ”

Li hang narrowed his eyes and already had the answer in his heart.

“Because he had an appointment with Zhou Cuihua and boss Wang, Li Hang woke up very early the next morning. ”

“Li Da Long was making breakfast in the kitchen. When he saw her wake up so early, he smiled and said, “Hang Hang, where are you going so early?” ”

“Li hang smiled and said, “I made an appointment with my classmate to go to the suburbs to pick green flowers, so I woke up early.”When he lied, his face was not red, and his heart was not beating, so no one could see any flaws. ”

“Li da long said, “Indeed, you should wake up early when you go to the suburbs. What do you want to eat in the morning, Daddy will make it for you.” ”

“I’ll just have a sandwich.”

“Okay.”Li Da long nodded.

“While eating breakfast, Li da long said, “Hang Hang, if you have nothing to do tomorrow, don’t go out. There are guests at home tomorrow.” ”
