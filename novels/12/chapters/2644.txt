Translator: 549690339

“The next morning, Zhou Cuihua boarded the train to the south. ”

Li Hang also started to work at his new company.

Everything seemed to be moving in a positive direction.

“”Xiao Li, take this document to type.”The old employee threw a stack of documents to Li Hang. ”

“Li hang smiled and tried his best not to offend anyone. “Okay, Xiao Mei, I’ll go right away.” ”

“Just as Li Hang was carrying the documents to the printing room, he suddenly saw a familiar figure at the elevator entrance. ”

That person was wearing a black suit and an exquisite wristwatch on his wrist.

“Every movement of his exuded the aura of a business elite, causing the passing employees to look at him. ”

Who was that.

Li Hang was stunned.

“Then, three words appeared in his mind: Ouyang Cheng. ”

It was him.

“It was an Lizi’s fiancé, Ouyang Cheng. ”

Why was he here?

“Oh…”

“Just as Li Hang was about to chase after him, that figure disappeared into the elevator in front of him, and Li Hang himself was pulled back by his colleague beside him. ”

“”Little Li, what are you doing? That’s a private elevator. Although the staff elevators are very busy now, you wouldn’t go to the extent of wanting to take a private elevator, right?” ”

Only then did li hang react. “I saw an acquaintance.”

“His colleague, Wu Jing, said in surprise, “Acquaintance? You mean the person who was at the elevator just now?” ”

“Yes.”Li hang nodded.

“Wu Jing continued, “Do you know who that is? Ouyang Cheng! He Ye Group’s boss! How could you possibly know him!” ”

“Li hang said, “I really know him!” ”

“”Then what’s your relationship with him?”Wu Jing said, “Don’t tell me you’re his sister. One of You is surnamed Ouyang while the other is surnamed Li.” ”

“Most importantly, she did not look like a rich person from the way she looked at Li Hang. ”

“Li hang said, “Can’t we be very good friends?” ”

“Wu Jing immediately laughed out loud, “This is so funny! Director Cheng would make friends with someone like you?” ”

“Li hang frowned slightly, feeling extremely angry. ”

“Wu Jing Sized Li hang up and down before continuing to tease him. “But I did hear that director Cheng has a fiancée. You Can’t be that fiancée, right?” ”

“At this point, Wu Jing seemed to have thought of something and continued, “But her fiancée’s surname is an, not Li.” ”

Not surnamed Li.

Surnamed an.

On what basis did an Lizi have?

On what basis?

“Wu Jing clenched her fingers tightly, feeling extremely indignant. ”

Why did she lose to an Lizi time and time again? How was she inferior to an Lizi?

“Since the heavens had allowed her to meet Ouyang Cheng Here, then she must get Ouyang Cheng’s attention! ”

Definitely!

“Wu Jing pulled Li Hang. “Let’s Go, stop daydreaming! Let me tell you, flowers will never bloom in the dust.” ”

“Just like that, Li Hang was pulled away by Wu Jing. ”

“Coincidentally, when Li Hang came back with the printed documents, he met Ouyang Cheng again. ”

Li hang narrowed his eyes.

“This time, she had to let Wu Jing know whether she was daydreaming or not. ”

“Li hang slightly raised his eyes and pretended to inadvertently look in Ouyang Cheng’s direction. Then, his eyes were full of surprise. “Ouyang!” ”

“In the Lin family’s banquet hall, Li Hang called Ouyang Cheng his brother-in-law. ”

But Li Hang knew that successful men like them would not easily admit that they had a fiancée.

So it was better to call him Ouyang.

“After all, she was an Lizi’s cousin. Back in the banquet hall, she could be considered to have a good conversation with Ouyang Cheng. After Ouyang Cheng saw her, he would definitely be very surprised. ”

“After Ouyang Cheng called out, Wu Jing’s eyes widened, and she looked at Li Hang in disbelief. ”

Li Hang’s face was just right for a smile.

When was a girl the most beautiful?

“Of course, it was when she smiled. ”

She wanted Ouyang Cheng to be able to see her most beautiful self at any time.

Who knew that Ouyang Cheng did not even look at her and walked straight out of the door.

He did not hear it?

“This was Li Hang’s first reaction. If Ouyang Cheng had heard it, it would not be like this! ”

“Ouyang!”Li hang increased the volume of his voice.

“This time, even the other people on the side also looked in Li Hang’s direction. ”

“Ouyang Cheng!”

“At this moment, Ouyang Cheng’s assistant beside him looked in his direction and immediately said to the person-in-charge of PL company, “When your company is recruiting talents, is there no threshold?” ”

“The hidden line of this sentence was, any Tom, Dick, or Harry can enter? ”

“The person-in-charge repeatedly apologized and then looked in Li Hang’s direction and angrily said, “Director Cheng’s name is also something you can call!” ”

Li Hang’s face was slightly pale.

She thought that she and Ouyang Cheng should not be so estranged.

“”Let’s go quickly!”Wu Jing immediately pulled Li hang in another direction and did not forget to explain, “She has a fever!” ”

“When they returned to the office, Li Hang’s face was full of confusion. ”Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

She did not understand why things had turned out this way!

“Wu Jing said in a low voice, “Don’t worry, I will keep this matter a secret for you! I will definitely not tell anyone else!” ”

“As soon as she said this, the minister walked in. “Who is Li Hang?” ”

Li hang instantly reacted. Did Ouyang Cheng suddenly think of her and want to see her?

“I am!”

“The minister continued, “Li Hang, you failed your internship and were fired.” ”

Fired?

“Why?”Li Hang looked at the minister. “There has to be a reason for your dismissal!”

“It will be on the dismissal slip. Pack your things and leave quickly.”

“After saying that, the minister left the office. ”

“At the same time, Li Hang’s cell phone rang. ”

Was It Ouyang Cheng?

“The PL fired her, and then the he ye group asked her to go to work? ”

“Hello.”Li hang answered the phone with anticipation.

“”Hello, is this Ms. Li Hang? I’m the police of Wuling City in Jiangde Province. My surname is Jiang. Your mother had a car accident in Wuling city in Jiangde Province. She is now in the ICU Ward in Wuling City. The Doctor said that the situation is not objective. Come and see your mother one last time.” ”
