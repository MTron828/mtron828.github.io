Ou-pp commented, ‘I think what Hua Qi said is right! We need at least three days to complete a mission. Even God M can only complete one mission a day. How can this Niohuru.YZ complete 10 in a day?’

Green Dragon On The Left and White Tiger On The Right commented, ‘I agree with the comment above! Niohuru.YZ consists of a team of dogs!’

Good Night Amm commented, ‘I agree! This team of dogs are shameless!’

It was apparent that many people were feeling jealous of Niohuru.YZ’s achievements. They naturally assumed that a person’s capabilities were limited. If an ordinary person exceeded the the general population’s expectation and had achieved an unreachable result, they would subconsciously think that it was fake.

After all, in the technology world, the most experienced and powerful God M could only complete one ordinary mission in a day.

On the other hand, Niohuru.YZ had completed an average of ten missions a day.

In the past three years, there hadn’t been a single person who could better the great God M in the technology world. To think that Niohuru.YZ had only just appeared, and had immediately achieved such incredible results! This was too heaven-defying!

It was definitely fake.

Therefore, everyone felt that Hua Qi XL’s conspiracy theory was accurate.

As a result, the forum exploded.

Niohuru.Xiaodai commented, ‘Have you guys eaten way too many lemons? I can’t believe you guys believe this conspiracy about teams! This is the tech world, not the food industry! Our Daddy YZ doesn’t need a team of people to solve his missions! He doesn’t need any kind of marketing either!’

Niohuru.Tower’s Eighth Brother commented, ‘Sand Lemon Spirit! How dare you claim that our Daddy YZ is a team of people without any proof! You are the one who’s a team! Your whole family is a team!’

Niohuru.I Am An Expert In Demolishing Houses, ‘Someone here has insulted our Daddy YC! Where is the Niohuru family? Kill the lemon spirit! @Niohuru.Little Green, Niohuru.Silently Follow Your Heart, Niohuru.Unforgettable and 50 other people.’

Ever since Niohuru.YZ became famous from her first mission, the legend had already gained a large number of fans in the technology world and they even established the Niohuru family. Anyone with the word ‘Niohuru’ in front of their ID was a member of the Niohuru family.

So far, the number of family members had reached more than 10,000.

Both sides had their own opinions and were arguing endlessly on the forum.

Li Qiandong also joined in the war. He had changed his ID to “Niohuru.Young Master Li” and even joined the Niohuru family.

After scolding a few people on the internet forum, he opened his chat window and messaged, ‘God, don’t mind those words on the forum! We all believe in you!’

Niohuru.YZ gave a simple reply, ‘?’

Li Qiandong figured that Niohuru.YZ probably didn’t care about these small things and continued, ‘God, I see that you’ve been doing other missions these days. Will this affect the progress of the OS?’

Niohuru.YZ replied, ‘Those missions were completed on my free time outside with my phone. It won’t affect the OS. You don’t have to worry. I’ll deliver the OS on time.’

Li Qiandong, who was in front of the screen, was stunned when he saw this line of words.

If those jealous people on the forum knew that Niohuru.YZ had only used his free time to complete so many tasks with his mobile phone, what kind of expression would they have?

They would probably die of jealousy, right?

Meanwhile, at the restaurant, Ye Zhuo had just finished eating her noodles when the shop started to get busy again.

Many customers had come to eat at noon because the hotpot and rabbit head were too delicious. They came over for a second time in the evening, and because of the coupons, it didn’t take long for them to form a long queue outside the restaurant.

Although the business at noon was pretty good, it wasn’t to the extent of having a long queue of people waiting in line.

Ye Shu was stunned. She never thought that business would be so good on the first day of opening.

The dishes were sold out before 8:30 pm. To make up for the customers who didn’t get to eat, Ye Zhuo gave them each a card.

With this card, they could get a spicy rabbit head for free if they came to eat tomorrow.

Although Ye Zhuo was a big shot in the science and technology world in her previously life, she had experience running her own business. She knew how to attract customers. More importantly, she wasn’t afraid of losing money.

In business, one had to give up something to gain something.

Ye Shu tabulated her returns for today. They had received 2,000 yuan in cash, and 6,000 yuan in Wechat and Alipay. If they excluding the rent, utilities, and costs, they had earned a total of 3,000 yuan!

If it wasn’t for the lack of dishes, they could have earned even more.

After confirming that she wasn’t mistaken, Ye Shu turned to look at Ye Zhuo and said in surprise, “Zhuo Zhuo, we earned 3,000 yuan today!”

In the past, her monthly salary was only 2,500 yuan, but now she had earned 3,000 yuan in just one day. It was a truly surreal feeling for Ye Shu.

Ye Zhuo looked back at her mother and said with a smile, “This is just the beginning. We will earn even more in the future!”

After saying that, Ye Zhuo continued, “By the way, Mom, there will definitely be more customers tomorrow than today. We need to prepare more dishes. We also need to hire two more people to help out at the restaurant. Otherwise, when I start school, you won’t be able to handle it all by yourself.”

Ye Shu nodded. “Yes! Zhuo Zhuo, you’ve thought of everything.”

How should she put it into words?

Ye Shu felt that Ye Zhuo was really amazing. She was clearly just a teenager, but she had thought of everything. She was even more mature than an adult.

At this moment, He Fengxian pushed the door open and came in. “Big Sister, why did you close shop so early?”

Actually, He Fengxian had knowingly asked this question.

‘Why did they close shop so early?

‘It is definitely because there was no business.’

He Fengxian was just here to gloat and laugh at their misfortune.

Ye Shu smiled and said, “Big Sister He, you’re here. Take a seat. Business is pretty good today. The dishes we prepared are all sold out, so we had to close the shop.”

‘What?’

He Fengxian looked at Ye Shu in surprise.

‘Business is pretty good?

‘All the prepared dishes have been sold out?

‘Ye Shu was too good at bragging!

‘Does she really take me for a fool?

‘When I came around to visit this morning, the shop was still empty and there was no customers here.’

He Fengxian continued, “Big Sister! You don’t have to be embarrassed about it! Even if I know that your business is not good, I won’t laugh at you!” He Fengxian rolled her eyes and continued, “Oh! I know what you mean! Big Sister, you want to sell the shop as soon as possible, so you lied to me and said that the business is good, right?”

Ye Shu said helplessly, “Big Sister He, you’ve misunderstood! Our business today is really good. We don’t plan to sell the shop.”

He Fengxian took Ye Shu’s hand. “Big Sister, we are all businessmen. I understand! I understand!”

‘This Ye Shu is really too much. I can’t believe she’s still lying to my face! Doesn’t she know who I, He Fengxian, am? Does she think I would fall for such a lie? I’ve been in business for more than 20 years, and I dare say I’ve got more experience that Ye Shu. Does she think that I’d be deceived?’

Seeing as He Fengxian did not believe her no matter what, Ye Shu did not bother to explain any further.

Seeing that Ye Shu did not explain herself, He Fengxian was even more certain that Ye Shu was lying to her. She mocked her several times openly and in her heart before leaving.

...

At ten o’clock in the evening, the mother and daughter returned home.

When Ye Sen heard that they had earned three thousand yuan on the first day of the restaurant’s opening, he was extremely excited. “Sister, I’ve said it earlier that my niece is not a nobody! I wasn’t wrong at all!”

Ye Shu was also very happy. “Oh right, Ye Sen, not only is it tiring to deliver packages now, the salary is not high either. Why don’t you quit your job and come to the shop to help?”

Ye Sen who had just opened his game refused her outright, “I feel that delivering packages is more suitable for me.”

“Why?” Ye Shu frowned.

Ye Sen didn’t explain. “I just like delivering packages.”

Hearing that, Ye Shu didn’t prod on.

Coincidentally, Ye Zhuo had come to the living room to pour herself a glass water. When she heard this, she smiled and said, “Since uncle likes delivering packages, when I have money, I’ll buy your company and let you be your own boss.”

“Okay.” Ye Sen said excitedly, “Big Niece, I will wait for you to buy our company! Good luck! Cool!”

“How much does it cost to buy your company?” Ye Zhuo continued to ask.

Ye Sen thought Ye Zao was joking and said casually, “About 50 to 60 million.”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

50 to 60 million...

How much money did she have in her card now?

Ye Zao rubbed his chin and went back to her room to continue coding. She had to complete the OS as soon as possible and then buy over Ye Sen’s express delivery company!

...

At the Cen family home.

Madam Cen had been taking the medicine prescribed by Ye Zhuo for the past few days. Not only had her sleep improved, but her appetite and complexion had also improved a lot.

Cen Shaoqing who had gone to Beijing for a week-long trip finally returned home. When he saw the energetic old lady, he thought that his eyes were playing tricks on him.

“Grandma, are you really okay?” When he first heard Zhou Xiang say that his grandmother had recently recovered a lot, Cen Shaoqing thought that Zhou Xiang was just comforting him. He did not expect that his grandmother’s health had indeed improved a lot!

“Yes!” The old lady walked around in front of Cen Shaoqing. “Not only am I okay, I have even found you a beautiful wife!”

Beautiful wife?

Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads in his hand, his expression inexplicable.

How should he tell his grandmother that he really had no intention of getting married?

Seeing that Cen Shaoqing did not give her a response, Madam Cen raised the walking stick in her hand and whacked him.

As she hit him, she scolded,?“Don’t act all high and mighty! Do you think you’re some unrivaled super handsome guy in the universe? Let me tell you! Brat, you don’t have the liberty of deciding whether you want to be with her. In fact, she’s not even interested in you!”
