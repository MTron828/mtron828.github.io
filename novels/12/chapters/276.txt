“Pingting!”

“”I’m not going! Brother! Stop talking! I Won’t go!”Saying this.., zhao Pingting looked up at Zhao Yingjun and softened her tone. “Brother, don’t force me. Can you let me live a little happier in the last three months?” ”

Wasn’t it just death?

People die.

There was nothing to be afraid of.

“Zhao Yingjun, who had been holding back his tears, suddenly burst into tears. He turned his head and wiped the tears off his face. ”

“Pingting! Child! I beg you! Can I kneel down for You?”Mother Zhao knelt at Zhao Pingting’s feet. “Can you go to the hospital? Let’s listen to the Doctor and cooperate with the treatment!”

“Mom!”Zhao Pingting cried out and knelt on the ground.

“”If it’s not enough for your mother to kneel down for you, I will kneel down for You Too! Child! You are still so young and your life has just begun. You Can’t be harmed! As long as there is a glimmer of hope, we can’t Let It Go!” ”

“At the critical moment of life and death, Father Zhao couldn’t care about anything else and knelt down with her. ”

“As parents, they couldn’t just watch their daughter die. ”

Regardless of whether she could be cured or not.

“Even if they knew the final result, they couldn’t let Zhao Pingting go. ”

They couldn’t!

“”Dad! Can you not do this? I beg you! You have to get up quickly! We all know in our hearts that this illness can not be cured, so why should we waste time and money? “When the time comes, there will be no one left and the money will be gone too. Why do you all have to do this?” ”

“Zhao Yingjun pulled Tang Jia and knelt down together. “Pingting, father and mother are already so old. Do you have the heart to see them do this for you? Big Brother and your sister-in-law are begging you too. Please cooperate with the treatment!” ”

The whole family knelt on the ground just like that.

Zhao Pingting’s eyes were filled with tears and her heart was filled with grief.

Why did this illness bother her?

“If she died, so be it. ”

“But now, she had dragged her family down with her. ”

“”I promise! I Promise You! Dad, Mom, Big Brother, sister-in-law, quickly get up!” ”

“Really?”Mother Zhao was so happy that she cried.

Zhao pingting nodded.

“”Good! Good!”Mother Zhao was so happy that she cried. She pulled Zhao Pingting up. “Pingting, don’t worry. We will definitely cure you! Definitely!” ”

“”Mom is right! Little Sister, you will definitely get better.” ”

Everyone was very happy that Zhao Pingting was finally willing to compromise and go to the hospital for treatment.

Zhao Pingting’s mother was busy packing her clothes.

Zhao Pingting’s illness would definitely need to be hospitalized.

“After packing up, the family set off for the best hospital in Yunjing City. ”

“After a series of examinations, Zhao Pingting’s mother and Tang Jia were accompanying Zhao Pingting. ”

Father Zhao and Zhao Yingjun were talking to the doctor inside.

“”Doctor, is there any hope for my daughter to be cured?” ”

The Doctor looked at the examination report with a very serious expression. “The patient’s cancer cells have already spread and the infection in her lungs is serious...” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Zhao Yingjun quickly asked, “Then can we still operate?” ”

“”Let’s do an in-hospital operation first and do radiation treatment!”! “You, the patient’s family, should also be mentally prepared. The lungs are the most important respiratory organ in the human body, and lung cancer is also a cancer with a mortality rate! “From the current situation, the patient still has at most three months.” ”

The radiation treatment was just to seek psychological comfort.

They could not just do nothing and watch people die.

This was also the reason why many people had to go bankrupt to go for treatment after they got cancer.

“Hearing the doctor’s verdict with their own ears, Father Zhao and Zhao Yingjun could not help but cry out loud. ”

“Father Zhao held the doctor’s hand tightly and knelt down, “Doctor! I beg you! Save My Daughter! My daughter is only nineteen years old this year! She just entered university! Her life has just begun! How about this, you transfer my lungs to my daughter! I’m fifty-five years old! It doesn’t matter if I die, but my daughter can not die! She can not die! I beg you! Save My Daughter! If you can save my daughter, I will do anything you ask me to do!” ”

Zhao’s father’s wish was to win the lottery.

It would be best if he could earn fifty million at one go.

But now.

He only hoped that he could have a healthy daughter.

He could exchange for his daughter’s health at all costs.

Only now did he understand what the greatest wealth in life was health.

“The doctor quickly pulled Father Zhao up, “Please get up. Our job as doctors is to treat patients and save people. Don’t worry, we will do our best to save the patients! But you also know that the medical community has not yet conquered cancer and reached a complete cure for the disease. Once we get this disease, we can only do our best! The rest is up to fate.” ”
