“Chapter 531: 135: sister-protecting maniac, accidentally gay, face-slapping Feng Xianxian! 1”

Translator: 549690339

Feng Xianxian grew up with Lin Ze.

She knew Lin Ze very well.

She once wondered if Lin Ze was misogynistic.

“After all, she was smart and cute from a young age. The four daughters-in-law of the Lin family treated her like their own daughter, and the little boys they grew up with all became her followers.”

Only Lin Ze avoided her.

“At first, Feng Xianxian thought that Lin Ze had a problem with her and was targeting her alone.”

“Later, Feng Xianxian found out that Lin Ze didn’t just hate her. He hated every girl.”

“Even at the sensitive age of 19, he was still indifferent to girls.”

“Moreover, Lin Ze hated girls touching him the most.”

Feng Xianxian could not forget the time when she pulled Lin Ze’s arm and acted coquettishly in order to please him.

“At that moment, Lin Ze seemed to have changed into a different person.”

His eyes were terrifyingly cold.

It was as if she was some disgusting trash.

“From then on, Feng Xianxian did not dare to provoke Lin ze anymore and humiliated herself.”

“Feng Xianxian just looked at Ye Zao, her eyes full of sarcasm.”

Lin Ze was about to make ye Zao lose face.

He didn’t even like his own brother.

What right did ye Zao have to stay in the Lin Family?

But in the next second...

Feng Xianxian was stunned.

Lin Ze naturally bent down to pick up the crystal clip under the table and handed it to Ye Zao. “Here.”

He picked it up?

Lin Ze actually picked it up!

Why didn’t Lin Ze lose his temper?

Wasn’t Lin Ze Misogynistic?

Feng Xianxian’s face was full of shock.

She was dumbfounded.

What the hell was going on?

“Ye Zao took the clip, put it to his ear, and walked out.”

“There was a large backyard garden behind the hotel. It was the eighth month of the Chinese lunar calendar, and the garden was full of flowers of all colors, with golden osmanthus being the most eye-catching.”

“Accompanied by the true chirping of birds, a breeze blew, bringing with it the fragrance of flowers.”

“Ye Zao walked on the path in the garden. He took a deep breath, and the weariness between his brows disappeared a little.”

“At this moment, there was the sound of light footsteps behind him.”

Ye Zao looked back slightly.

“The person who came was dressed in a plain white robe. He was holding a string of blood-red Buddhist beads in his hand. Against the light, his facial features could not be seen clearly. As he walked, he burst out with a powerful domineering aura.”

“Why are you here?”

Cen Shaoqing’s tone was low. “I came out to get some air.”

“You don’t like it inside?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly.

“It’s alright.”Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads. “Do you like it?”

“Ye Zhuo’s tone was indifferent. “Other than being a little stuffy, everything else is alright...””

Cen Shaoqing chuckled.

The two of them chatted for a while longer before ye Zhuo urged Cen Shaoqing to go in.

Cen Shaoqing raised his eyebrows. “You’re not going in?”

“”You go in first.”Ye Zhuo continued, “I’ll be right behind you.””

“”Then you go in first.”CEN Shaoqing said, “I came out after you.””

“Ye Zhuo thought for a moment. It seemed to be the case, so he turned around and walked in.”

“He had only taken a few steps when his hand was suddenly grabbed by someone. With a gentle pull, his entire body was pulled into someone’s embrace. The other hand held onto her waist. Perhaps it was because the gown was too thin, ye Zhuo could even feel the warmth coming from his fingertips, cen Shaoqing’s chin rested on her shoulder. Their breaths were one another.”

“”Leader, actually, I came out to see you.””

“Seeing ye Zao come out, Cen Shaoqing could no longer control his feet.”

Ye Zao’s eyes curved and he lowered his head. “You’re not pretending anymore?”

“”Yes.”Cen Shaoqing lowered his voice and said, “Let me hug you for a minute?””

“I’ll satisfy you.”

“A minute later, ye Zhuo reminded him, “One minute is up.””

“Why are you so fast?”Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly and let go of her.

Ye Zhuo lowered his head and tidied up his gown. “I’ll go in first.”

“Wait a minute.”

Cen Shaoqing called out to her.

“Huh?”Ye Zhuo looked back slightly.

“”Your hair is in a mess.”Cen Shaoqing reached out his hand and pulled the black hair on her cheek behind her ear. Then, he clamped the edge of the crystal again. His movements were extremely gentle, as if he was treating a fragile priceless treasure, his deep eyes were like ink stains.”

“From Cen Shaoqing’s angle, he could just see the tall and straight nose bridge of this person. His crimson lips were bright and beautiful.”

He wanted to kiss her.

“Cen Shaoqing’s heart suddenly beat faster, and the movements of his hands stopped.”

“Are you done?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyes slightly and asked.

Cen Shaoqing finally reacted. His slender fingers landed on her ear. “I’m done.”

“Then I’ll go first.”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing slightly nodded.
