Translator: 549690339

This traitor!

“She was so good to Li Man, but today Li man bite back. ”

“The witnesses and physical evidence were conclusive. The first trial sentenced man Jiangshan and Zhao Dan to be removed as the president of Manxing Country for desertion, deprived of political rights for life, and sentenced to 10 years in prison. ”

“In addition, Li Man was also sentenced to five years for being an accomplice. ”

“However, Li Man did not regret it. Instead, her wrinkled face was relieved. ”

“When she learned of this result, man Jiangshan’s face turned pale and he collapsed on the chair on the spot. ”

Zhao Dan was no better than man Jiangshan.

She never dreamed that things would turn out like this.

“Ye Zhuo should have been forced to kneel down and apologize to them, saying that she was wrong. ”

“But now, not only was ye Zao not a full moon, but they were also in prison. ”

Who exactly was ye Zao?

How did she know so much?

“Also, how did ye Zao Find Li Man? ”

They watched as man Jiangshan and Zhao Dan were finally brought to justice.

“The bullet screen was filled with cheers: “Good and evil will always be rewarded! From the moment you two threw away man Xing kingdom, you should have thought of today!” ”

“[ Miss Ye, I’m sorry. I misunderstood you previously! Therefore, Princess Full Moon, please rest in peace! Ten years in prison is really too easy for these two demons. ] ”

[ a human life is only ten years! Hehe! ]

“[ ten years is not a small amount. Zhao Dan is 42 this year, and the whole country is 48. Ten years later, they will be half-buried in the ground. If their lives are short, they might not be able to last until that day! ] ”

“I think Manxing is not a good person either!”

“The Manjiang couple is the Manjiang couple. Please don’t bring Manxing into their lives. I believe that Princess Manxing is definitely not that kind of person!”

“”Right, right, right. Don’t kill everyone in one shot!” ”

“”Apologize to Miss Ye! Also, apologize to my own actions. I shouldn’t have misunderstood Miss Ye and smeared her name because of the one-sided news!”! ”

[ miss ye saved the entire country of changyue. How could she be such a disloyal and unfilial person? I should have thought of it long ago. The feeling of slapping myself in the face is very uncomfortable. I Won’t do it again in the future. ]

“For a moment, the bullet comments were all apologizing to ye Zhuo. ”

Those who had been indignant and supportive of the Manjiang couple from the start also felt very uncomfortable.

Who would have thought that the truly vicious people would end up being the Manjiang couple!

No one would have thought that the President and Madam President of the Manxing Nation would both go to jail for desertion!

“In an instant, the entire star network was flooded with this news. ”

Those who could not watch the live broadcast climbed up the wall to watch the recording.

“After watching the recording, there were even more people scolding the Manjiang couple. ”

“Through a protective wall, ye Zhuo saw Li Man. ”

“Although she was sentenced to five years in prison, there was no sadness on Li Man’s face. She looked at Ye Zhuo, “Miss Ye, please apologize to the full moon princess on my behalf. I shouldn’t have left that year, and I shouldn’t have left her there when she was young.” ”

There was no medicine for regret in life. Li Man knew that it was useless for her to say anything now.

But it was better to say it than not saying anything at all.

“Ye Zhuo sat opposite her and said softly, “The matter is over. The Full Moon is dead, and you have received the punishment you deserve. Be a good person after you get out of prison.” ”

“Li Man stood up and bowed to ye Zhuo. “Then please apologize to the full moon princess on my behalf. If I could start over, I wouldn’t have done that!” ” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly. “She will definitely receive your apology.”

“Actually, this matter was not Li Man’s fault. ”

She was just following orders.

“Moreover, Zhao Dan had installed a surveillance camera on the full moon back then. Before Zhao Dan destroyed the surveillance camera, even if Li man turned around and secretly carried the full moon back, she wouldn’t be able to live. ”

“After coming out of the prison, Ye Zao looked at the Blue Sky that was as clear as water, and the corners of his mouth curled up into a beautiful arc. ”

“Father Zao!”

“Miss Ye!”

Mr. Feng and Leo came over from the side.

“Leo asked curiously, “Father Zao, what did that Li Man say to you?” ”

“”She asked me to apologize to the full moon,”ye Zao said. ”

“Leo nodded and continued, “Right, Father Zao, guess how we found Li Man?” ”

“How?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“Leo continued, “It’s strange. We searched for Li Man for three days and three nights, but we couldn’t find her. Just when we were scratching our ears and cheeks, Li man appeared by herself!” ”
