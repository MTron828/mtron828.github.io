How did this happen?

How did an Lizi Know About Wu Youyu?

Zhang Qingqing looked at the phone that was hung up on and her heart was in a mess.

What should she do?

What should she do now? RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Seeing Zhang Qingqing like this, mother Zhang immediately walked over. “Qingqing, what’s wrong with you? Are you not feeling well? Do you want to go to the hospital to have a look?””

Zhang Qingqing’s stomach was now the hope of the entire Zhang family. There couldn’t be any problems.

“”It’s fine, Mom. You Don’t have to worry.”Zhang Qingqing tried her best to calm herself down and continued, “Let’s go back to the hotel first.””

“”Okay.”Mother Zhang nodded first, then quickly reacted. “Hotel? Qingqing, you’re staying at a hotel now?””

“Yes.”Zhang Qingqing nodded.

“Mother Zhang said unhappily, “You are a healthy person now, how can you stay in a hotel? You should stay in the Lin family and let the servants of the Lin family take care of you!””

“Before coming to the capital, mother Zhang had already checked.”

“The Lin family lived in the most expensive manor in the capital, occupying more than ten acres of land. Now that Zhang Qingqing had the hope of the Lin family’s future, how could the Lin family let Zhang Qingqing stay in a hotel!”

“Hearing that, Father Zhang looked at Mother Zhang. “What does a short-sighted woman like you know? The matter between Qingqing and the young master of the Lin family has not been settled yet. What’s the big deal about rashly staying in the Lin Family? !”It was too degrading! Although the Zhang family was not a wealthy family, father Zhang still understood this point.”

Mother Zhang nodded. “I see.”

“Zhang Lei followed behind and asked, “Then when Will Qing Qing be able to move into the Lin Family?””

“Father Zhang continued, “After we have confirmed our marriage with the Lin family, Qing Qing will be able to officially marry into the Lin family and live in the Lin Family!””

“Zhang Lei said with some disappointment, “How long will that have to wait!””

“Father Zhang looked at Zhang Qing Qing and continued, “Your Sister has a child now. Don’t worry, the Lin family will not drag this out for too long!””

Zhang Qingqing walked away in a daze. She didn’t hear a single word father Zhang and Zhang Lei were saying.

“Soon, they left the airport.”

“Mother Zhang turned to look at Zhang Qingqing. “Qingqing, you just called your son-in-law. What did he say? Did he arrange a car to pick us up?””

“Zhang Qingqing continued, “He might be busy and didn’t pick up the call.””

“Mother Zhang said unhappily, “Mother-in-law didn’t even come to pick us up when she came to Beijing. This is too outrageous!””

“Not to mention mother Zhang, even father Zhang was displeased.”

“Zhang Qingqing hailed a taxi. “Dad, Mom, brother, let’s get in the car first!””

The family of four got in the car.

They soon arrived at the hotel entrance.

Zhang Qingqing used her own money to get a suite.

“After settling in her parents and brother, Zhang Qingqing called Lin Ze again.”

But the result was the same.

“So, Zhang Qingqing called an Lizi again, but an Lizi also blocked her!”

What happened?

Could it be that they already knew everything?

“But Wu Youyu was already dead, and there was no third person who knew about her and Wu Youyu. How on Earth did they know?”

Zhang Qingqing knew an Lizi’s address. She went straight to the Lin family villa to ask an Lizi about it.

The key was that an Lizi was gullible.

“As long as she could get past an Lizi, she would be able to get past the Lin Family!”

Zhang Qingqing waited anxiously at the entrance of the villa.

“After a long while, an Lizi finally walked out of the villa.”

“When she saw an Lizi, Zhang Qingqing immediately went up to her. “Lizi! Lizi!””

“Seeing Zhang Qingqing, an Lizi’s face had long lost its previous warmth.”

She had never thought that Zhang Qingqing would use her!

“Thinking about how she had almost caused Lin ze to suffer, an Lizi felt extremely guilty.”

“”Zhang Qingqing, you still have the nerve to come and look for me! If it wasn’t for you, my grandmother wouldn’t have any objections against me! Do you know that you’ve caused me to suffer!””

“It wasn’t easy for Old Lady Lin to accept an Lizi. After this incident, Old Lady Lin was full of complaints about her.”

“”No! I didn’t!”Zhang Qingqing continued, “Lizi, believe me, the child is really Lin Ze’s! I’ve never lied to You!””

“”At this time, you still want to lie to me!”An lizi continued, “Zhang Qingqing, do you really think that I don’t know anything? “You’ve been kept by Wu Youyu for a long time, and your child is also Wu Youyu’s! “Do you really think that you can secretly bribe the Doctor to change the pregnancy cycle without anyone knowing! “Zhang Qingqing, let me tell you, the heavens are watching! “There is a god three feet above you!””

“Hearing this, Zhang Qingqing almost lost her balance.”
