“Chapter 360: 111: mother, uncle, you’re trying to curry favor with your future uncle. You want to compete with her! 6”

It was also because his daughter was outstanding that Fifth Master Cen had taken a liking to her.

“If it was that idiot ye Zhuo instead, would it work? ”

Shen Rong blew on the nail polish she had just applied. “Do you even need to say that? I only ordered the servants to stew bird’s nest for Yourong this morning.”

Just then.

“Mu Yourong walked in from outside the door. “Dad, Mom.” ”

“Shen Rong hurriedly stood up from her chair. “Yourong, why are you out in the Sun? Are you getting a tan outside? What if your skin gets tanned?” ”

“”I’m going to take the exam,”Mu Yourong replied. ”

“What Exam?”Asked soldier Mu.

“The third subject exam.”

“Soldier MU said, “You should have told dad earlier that dad only needs to spend some money. Why waste time on learning!” ”

Money could make the world go round.

Not to mention a tiny driver’s license.

The corners of Mu Yourong’s mouth curled up. “I have to go to this exam in person.”

“Big Soldier Mu was a little curious, but he didn’t ask much. ”

This daughter of his was capable.

She must have her own reasons for saying this.

“Mu Yourong went upstairs, logged on to the technology website, and began to do her task. ”

After a period of time.

“Mu Yourong was already somewhat famous on the website, and she even added Dr. Warne as a friend. ”

“Now, there was only one NIU Hulu YC left. ”

“After completing a mission, Mu Yourong opened the forum. ”

She saw that the entire forum was discussing this year’s science and Technology Conference.

Doctor Niu Hulu: [ I wonder if this year’s science and Technology Conference will be able to invite YC’s father. ]

Niu Hulu Xiaodai: [ father is too low-key. I don’t think he will attend. ] 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“XR: [ it will be weird if the team dog dares to attend! ]! There were so many big shots present. Who could the team dog beat? Could I trouble the retards not to whitewash the team dog? Don’t you feel disgusted? Actually, I’m more looking forward to Niu Hulu YR. Compared to YC, YR is many times more realistic! ] ”

Three dots in a line: [ one above! I’m also looking forward to Yr. That must be a very beautiful lady! ]

“Niu Hulu Xiaodai: [ this is called Hua ran, right? ] ”

Niu Hulu: [ both of them are idiots. ]

Mu Yourong narrowed her eyes. She had to think of a way to get an invitation to the science and Technology Conference.

Once she participated in the science and Technology Conference.

It meant that she had obtained the recognition of the scientific and technological world!

“At that time, she could also meet the bigwigs of various countries at the science and Technology Conference. ”

...

Today was the day that Ye Sen returned to his country.

Ye Zhuo drove to the airport to pick up ye Sen.

She had come ten minutes earlier.

“Not long after, she saw ye Sen walk out of the crowd with a suitcase in his hand. ”

“To be more precise, he walked out of the crowd with a certain person while chatting and laughing. ”

That person had a slender figure and held a buddha pearl in his hand. He had an extraordinary temperament and stood out from the crowd. He was extremely eye-catching.

This is...

Cen Shaoqing?

Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly. Since when did ye Sen have such a good relationship with Cen Shaoqing?

Didn’t Ye Sen have a problem with Cen Shaoqing?

“Earlier, he had used a steel pipe to scare Cen Shaoqing? ”

What’s going on now?

Could it be that she was seeing things?

“Eldest niece!”Ye Sen pulled the suitcase and walked in front of ye Zao.

“Only then did ye Zao realize that there was a white gauze on ye Sen’s forehead. “Uncle, are you injured?” ”

“Ye Sen smiled and said, “There was a small problem in country P before, and it’s fine now. But it’s all thanks to Shaoqing! If it weren’t for him, eldest niece, you might not have been able to see Uncle Now!” ”

Shaoqing?

Ye Zao frowned without leaving a trace.

Did she really not hear wrongly?

Ye Sen continued to tell her about what happened that night.

“Hearing this, Ye Zao was also quite frightened. ”

No wonder ye Sen’s attitude towards Cen Shaoqing had changed so drastically.

“The current situation in country P was particularly chaotic. There were almost daily murders and he was in a foreign country. If it weren’t for Cen Shaoqing, Ye Sen would indeed be in grave danger. ”

“”Brother Five, thank you.” ”

Cen Shaoqing’s tone was indifferent. “Don’t take it to heart. It was nothing.”

“Ye Zhuo turned to look at ye Sen. “Uncle, why didn’t you tell me such a big thing happened?” ”

“Ye Sen laughed and laughed. He dragged Ye Zhuo out, “I’m Fine, right? It’s just a little scratch! There’s no need to make a big deal out of it! Let’s go, let’s find a place to eat. Airplane food isn’t delicious at all. Shaoqing and I are hungry!” ”

Ye Zao didn’t say anything else.

The three of them walked to the parking lot.

Ye Zao drove while Cen Shaoqing and Ye Sen sat in the back seat.

“Because ye Sen was still injured, ye Zao didn’t race. ”

“After a while, the car stopped in front of a high-end vegetarian restaurant. ”

“Cen Shaoqing looked up at the restaurant’s name, and the corners of his mouth curled up slightly. ”
