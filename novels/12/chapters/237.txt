“Zhou xiang continued, “That’s why, don’t give yourself any pressure! Isn’t it just a Beijing University? Even if you don’t take the college entrance exam, we have a way to get them to admit you...” ”

Old Madam Cen nodded as well.

“Ye Zhuo smiled and looked up. “Aunt Xiang, Grandma Cen, taking shortcuts is not good! It’s not fair to those who work hard for the college entrance exam. Don’t worry, I’m so smart. I’ll definitely be able to get into Beijing University on my own!” ”

Old Madam Cen looked at Ye Zao with satisfaction.

“No matter how she looked at it, she liked it. ”

“Her granddaughter-in-law was really amazing. She could have taken a shortcut, but she had to rely on her own strength! In this world, how many people could be like her granddaughter-in-law? ”

Her granddaughter-in-law was simply the best granddaughter-in-law in the world.

“”En! Yezi, you’re so smart and awesome. You’ll definitely get into Beijing University!” ”

Zhou Xiang nodded. “Zha Zha! I believe in You Too!”

...

At the same time.

Beijing.

“Although Feng Xianxian had been in a car accident before, she had recovered quite well during this period of time. She was no different from an ordinary person now. ”

“The college entrance exam was about to begin. In the past few days, Feng Xianxian had been working exceptionally hard! ”

“Although her results were already very good, she still could not relax. ”

“Among the rich and powerful families, only a few of them had good results. Those who were able to get into a well-known university were mostly people who spent money! ”

She had to get good results and be the one who stood out the most. She had to make everyone’s eyes light up and fight for Feng Qianhua!

“Feng Qianhua came over to give Feng Xianxian some snacks. “Xianxian, eat something before you study.” ”

“”Thank you, Mom.” ”

Feng Qianhua looked at Feng Xianxian with satisfaction.

“This daughter of hers had been very outstanding since she was young. She was proficient in all kinds of music, chess, calligraphy, and painting. When it was her day off, she would go to all kinds of training classes by herself. She had never bothered her at all. ”

“”Xianxian, how many marks do you think you can get in the college entrance examination this time?” ”

“Feng Xianxian said, “If I surpass Lin Ze, it shouldn’t be a problem for me to get into a key university.” ”

“Really?”Feng Qianhua asked in surprise.

Feng Qianqian nodded.

“Although Lin Ze’s results in class were not bad, they were not considered top-notch. Her results had always been in the top three in the class. ”

Lin Ze? Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

He could not be compared to her.

He could only be crushed by her.

Feng Qianhua knew Feng Qianqian very well.

“She knew that her daughter never boasted. Since she had said so, she must have a 90% chance of surpassing Lin Ze. ”

What was Lin Ze?

“The son of a lowly person. Even if he grew up in a rich family, he would always have a lowly bloodline in his bones. He would never be able to compare to Feng Qianxian! ”

“At that time, Old Lady Lin would understand that only the child born between her and Lin Jincheng was qualified to be the heir of the Lin family. ”

The others were all defective!

“Feng Qianhua narrowed her eyes and continued, “Xianxian, study hard. I Won’t disturb you anymore.” ”

Feng Xianxian nodded.

“After leaving the room, Feng Qianhua took out the health soup that she had prepared long ago and brought it to Old Lady Lin. ”

Just as she entered the Lin family’s door.

She heard Old Lady Lin’s laughter.

Feng Qianhua frowned slightly.

She was a little puzzled. Who else could make Old Lady Lin so happy?

“When she reached the back room, she realized that it was Lin Ze who was talking to Old Lady Lin. ”

“Ever since that incident, the relationship between the two of them had been getting better and better. ”

Feng Qianhua narrowed her eyes.

“Aunt Lin.”

“Qianhua is here.”Old Lady Lin smiled and looked up.

Feng Qianhua then greeted Lin Ze. “Ah Ze.”

“Lin Ze ignored Feng Qianhua and turned to look at Old Lady Lin. “Grandma, I have an appointment with a classmate to play ball. I’ll be leaving first.” ”

Play Ball?

Feng Qianhua’s eyes flashed with sarcasm.

Lin Ze still wanted to play at a time like this.

No wonder he couldn’t compare to Feng Xianxian.

He was a useless fool!

“Go.”Old Mrs. Lin nodded lovingly.

“Meow.”A cat suddenly came out of the corner and followed Lin Ze’s footsteps.

“You go back.”Lin Ze stopped.

“Not only did brother Meow not go back, but it ran over and rubbed Lin ze’s calf. ”

“Lin Ze frowned slightly, bent down slightly, picked up brother Meow with a look of disgust, and walked out. ”

The Butler at the side saw this scene and could not help but smile.

The little young master was a child.

Cold on the outside but kind on the inside.

“He looked like he despised the cat and kept saying that he wanted to throw it away, but in fact, he liked it very much in his heart. ”

Feng Qianhua smiled and scooped out the health soup for Old Lady Lin.
