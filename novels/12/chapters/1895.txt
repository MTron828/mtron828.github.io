“Thinking of Linda’s earlier instructions, Li Shuyi continued, “Where is she now?” ”

“”She’s in the living room downstairs,”the servant replied. ”

“Linda said, “I’ll be right down.” ”

“With that, Linda walked downstairs. ”

“Fang Yueyin stood there and when he saw Li Shuyi, he smiled and said, “Shuyi, where is your mother? I have something to discuss with your mother.” ”

“Li Shuyi said, “I’m sorry, Aunt. My mother is not at home due to some matters.” ”

“”Not at home?”Fang Yueyin said with some disappointment, “Then where did she go?” ”

“”I’m not too sure about that either,”Li Shuyi said with a smile. “It’s the same if you tell me anything.” ”

“Fang yueyin said, “I can’t explain this to you. You still have to tell your mother. is your mother coming back tonight? Why Don’t I Come Back Tonight?” ”

“”Alright, you can come back tonight. I Can’t guarantee whether my mother will be home or not,”Li Shuyi said. ”

“Okay.”Fang Yueyin nodded and turned to leave. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“After Fang Yueyin left, Li Shuyi immediately ran upstairs and told Linda about this. ”

“Hearing this, Linda’s lips curled into a smile. “What did I say?”How could Li Sanzhu and Fang Yueyin let such a good thing go! ! ”

“Li Shuyi said, “You’re really amazing! Oh right, my aunt said that she would come over again tonight. Do you want to see her tonight?” ”

“Linda smiled and said, “Since she’s so sincere, I’ll see her tonight.” ”

“”Okay.”Li Shuyi nodded. “If she comes again tonight, I Won’t stop her.” ”

“At night, Fang yinyue arrived as expected. ”

“Li Shuyi looked at fang yinyue and said, “Little aunt, please wait a moment. I’ll go look for my mom.” ”

“Okay.”Fang yinyue nodded.

Li Shuyi went upstairs to look for Linda.

“Linda didn’t go downstairs immediately. Instead, she deliberately waited for about twenty minutes. ”

“She thought that Fang yinyue would be angry. Unexpectedly, when she went downstairs, not only did Fang yinyue not get angry, he even greeted her with a smile. ”

“Thinking about it, it was normal. After all, Fang yinyue was the one who had asked her to do it! ”

“”Sister-in-law, I’m sorry. I just received a call. It took you such a long time.”Linda walked over. ”

“”It’s nothing.”Fang yinyue smiled and said, “I don’t have anything to do either.” ”

“Linda continued, “Why didn’t I Make Tea For You? Where’s the Butler? Quickly go and make tea for third mistress.” ”

“Fang yueyin smiled and said, “We’re all family. It doesn’t matter whether we have tea or not. I came here today because I have something to discuss with you.” ”

Something to discuss?

It was obvious without even thinking. It must be because of the matter between Li Yueyue and John.

It was just that she did not know how Fang Yueyin would say it.

“If it was her, she definitely would not know how to say it. ”

“Linda said, “What is it, sister-in-law? Speak.” ”

Fang Yueyin looked at Linda and prepared his lines in his heart.

“Seeing Fang yinyue like this, Linda was even more pleased. When Fang yinyue rejected Li Shuyi, why didn’t she think of this now? ”

Just wait.

She would definitely embarrass Fang yinyue later and let Fang yinyue know how amazing she was.

“After a moment, Fang yinyue continued, “Second sister-in-law, I heard that mom is coming back?” ”

Mother?

Old Lady Li?

“Linda was stunned. She had thought that Fang yinyue would definitely mention Li Yueyue, but she didn’t expect Fang yinyue to actually mention Old Lady Li. ”

“Linda frowned without leaving a trace, then she said, “I think so. You know mother. She has always looked down on us daughters-in-law. If there’s anything, she would discuss it with your second brother. As for her, I’m not too sure either. Oh right, sister-in-law, didn’t you say that you have something to discuss with me? Just say it directly.” ”

“In this world, the most difficult relationship was always that of a mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. ”

“Fang yinyue said, “That’s what I want to talk about. I heard that mom will be staying in the country to retire in the future.” ”

What?

Fang yinyue actually came today for the matter of Old Lady Li’s retirement!

Then what about Li Yueyue’s matter?

“Linda maintained the smile on her face and continued, “It should be like this. I’m not too sure about the specific situation. Sister-in-law, since you’re here today, don’t you have anything else to discuss with me?” ”

“After saying this, Linda paused and said, “We’re all family. Don’t feel embarrassed. Just say what you have to say.” ”

“Fang yinyue said, “That’s all. But since sister-in-law doesn’t know, I won’t ask anymore. I’ll get Sanzhu to contact country c.” ”

She didn’t want to bother with the old lady’s matters anymore.
