“Hearing this, Xie Wanqiu let down her guard. ”

“Zheng Wanyin was talented and good-looking. If she got along with Cen Shaoqing Day and night, Cen Shaoqing would definitely be conquered by Zheng Wanyin. ”

Just like how Zhou Zuolong was back then.

Zhou Zuolong and Wu Lan were also a passionate couple back then. What happened after that?

“Later on, Zhou Zuolong was also conquered by her! ”

“Whatever she could do, Zheng Wanyin could do as well! ”

“Xie wanqiu smiled and said, “Xiangxiang is the most considerate. Old Man, just do as Xiangxiang says.” ”

Zhou Zuolong had always listened to Xie wanqiu the most. “Alright.”

“After saying that, Zhou Zuolong turned to look at Zheng Wanyin. “Yinyin, remember to go back with your second aunt later.” ”

Zheng Wanyin nodded.

“Zhou Zuolong looked at Zhou Xiang and continued, “Right, did you come to the capital after entering the north?” ”

“”Yes,”Zhou Xiang said, “Dad, I’ve been quite busy during this period of time in the north. When he has time, he will definitely come and visit you.” ”

Zhou Zuolong snorted coldly. “Busy? Busy delivering pink diamonds to outsiders? Yinyin is his biological niece. How did he treat Yinyin?”

“Zhou Xiang was about to say that ye Zhuo was not an outsider, but he swallowed his words. ”

Zhou Zuolong really disliked ye Zhuo.

“If she said that ye Zhuo was not an outsider again, she would definitely add fuel to the fire. ”

“Zhou zuolong continued, “Go and tell that unfilial son. If he still doesn’t come to the hospital to see his mother and me, I won’t have him as a son in the future! At that time, don’t blame me for not taking into account the relationship between father and Son!”Zhou Jinbei was a businessman, at the same time, he was also a public figure that touched China. If he really caused a scandal, then everything that he had now would be gone. ”

“”Dad, Jinbei is still young. There are many things that he can’t consider so comprehensively. I apologize on his behalf. Please don’t blame him.”He paused, zhou Xiang added, “Jinbei is your biological son. You should know very well what kind of person he is. He is not unfilial. He just hasn’t seen your painstaking efforts yet. I believe that he will understand you one day.” ”

Zhou Zuolong and Zhou Jinbei’s father and son had fallen out like this. Zhou Xiang could only put in a good word with both sides to resolve their misunderstanding of each other.

“In fact, all the reasons were due to Zhou Jinbei’s unfilial behavior ”

“Zhou Jinbei felt that his mother’s death was related to Zhou Zuolong, so he had always held a deep grudge against Zhou Zuolong. ”

“Zhou Zuolong, on the other hand, could not tolerate his biological son being like this. ”

“Zhou Xiang believed that as long as the suicide note was repaired, Zhou Jinbei would let go of his misunderstanding of Zhou Zuolong. ”

The father and son would also bury the hatchet.

One week.

One week at most.

Zhou Jinbei said that the experts would repair Wu Lan’s suicide note within a week.

“At that time, he would see the scene that Zhou Xiang wanted to see. ”

“Xie wanqiu continued, “Old Man, Xiang Xiang is right. After all, Jinbei is your biological son. Your blood flows in his bones. One day, he will see your painstaking care for him. “As for this child, it’s normal for him to make some mistakes. As parents, we should learn to be tolerant and understanding, and not blindly blame him. “Moreover, it’s said in the book of sages that everyone makes mistakes? “Let’s not talk about Jinbei being a child!” ”

“Hearing this, Zhou Xiang looked at Xie wanqiu with a hint of shock in her eyes. ”

She did not expect Xie Wanqiu to speak up for Zhou Jinbei.

Zhou Jinbei should have seen this scene.

Zhou Jinbei had a deep misunderstanding of Xie wanqiu.

“In fact, Xie Wanqiu treated Zhou Jinbei very well. ”

“Zhou Jinbei was in Beijing and knew that Xie Wanqiu was in the hospital, but he didn’t come to the hospital to see her. ”

“If it was anyone else, they would definitely be very angry. ”

“But not only was Xie wanqiu not angry, she even spoke up for Zhou Jinbei. ”

“Not to mention stepmothers, even many biological mothers would not be able to do this. ”

But Xie Wanqiu did it.

“At this moment, Zhou Xiang was very grateful to Xie wanqiu. At the same time, she felt a little guilty. ”

“After all, she had not treated Xie wanqiu well previously. ” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Zhou Xiang raised his head to look at Xie Wanqiu. “Mom, thank you.” ”

Xie wanqiu laughed coldly in her heart.

A Fool was a fool. Even she could not tell that she was acting.

She really didn’t know why Cen Haifeng would marry such an idiot back then.

An idiot would return the favor!

“If Cen Haifeng had married Xie Ying back then, things would definitely not be like this now. ”

“Since Zhou Xiang liked watching her acting so much, she would let Zhou Xiang get what she wanted. Xie wanqiu smiled and said, “Silly Child, why are you still saying thank you to Mom! Mom only has this pair of sons and daughters now. It’s only right for me to treat you well!” ”
