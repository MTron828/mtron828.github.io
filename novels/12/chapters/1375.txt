“As a daughter, Zhou Xiang could also understand Zhou Zuolong. ”

“Zhou jinbei continued, “Sis, come over first.” ”

“”Are you really not coming over to see Dad?”Zhou Xiang continued, “Mom is here too.” ”

“”SIS, I’ve said it before. I only have one mom! Xie wanqiu wants to be my mom. Let’s do it in our next life!”Zhou Jinbei had always been a very steady person, but when he mentioned Xie wanqiu, it was as if he had become a different person. ”

“”Jinbei, Dad and mom have been married for so many years. You should also let it go.” ” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Zhou Jinbei knew Zhou Xiang’s personality, so he was not angry. He continued, “Sis, come quickly. I’ll wait for you here.” ”

“After saying this, Zhou Jinbei hung up the phone. Looking at the phone that was hung up, Zhou Xiang sighed helplessly. ”

“This little brother of hers was good at everything, but he was easily stuck in his own circle and could not get out. ”

“After a while, Zhou Xiang walked to the front of the car and opened the door. She ordered the driver, “Little Xu, go to delong Road Cafe.” ”

“Little Xu looked at Zhou Xiang from the rearview mirror and said hesitantly, “Madam, do you want to go to the hospital to have a look?” ”

Zhou Xiang’s left face was completely swollen. It looked a little scary.

“Zhou Xiang touched her face and was silent for a moment before saying, “Don’t go yet.” ”

“Okay.”

Zhou Xiang sent a message.

“A moment later, Zhou Xiang looked up at the driver and said, “Little Xu, let’s go to Beijing University first.” ”

“Okay.”Little Xu nodded.

“Beijing university was not far from the hospital, so they arrived very quickly. ”

“Just as they stopped the car, Ye Zhuo, who was wearing a black windbreaker, jogged over. “Auntie.” ”

Zhou Xiang pushed the door open and got out of the car. “Sear Sear.”

“Even though Zhou Xiang had mentioned in the text that she needed ointment to reduce swelling, ye Zhuo was still a little surprised when he saw Zhou Xiang’s swollen face. “Auntie, Are You Alright?” ”

“”I’m fine, I’m fine.”Zhou xiang smiled and said, “I just accidentally fell. You can just get me a bottle of medicine to reduce swelling and stasis.” ”

Fell?

How could she fall on her face?

Zhou Xiang’s face was obviously slapped by someone.

“In the CEN family, other than the Old Lady Cen, who else would dare to Slap Zhou Xiang? ”

“However, the Old Lady Cen would never hit Zhou Xiang. ”

“In that case, the only person left was Xie wanqiu. ”

“Alright.”Ye Zao collected his thoughts and nodded slightly. He took out the ointment that he had prepared beforehand.

“Zhou Xiang took the ointment with both hands. “Thank you, Zao Zao.” ”

“Ye Zao’s medical skills were brilliant. The ointment that she took out would definitely be able to quickly reduce the swelling and dissolve the stasis. This way, Zhou Jinbei would not discover anything. ”

“”You’re welcome.”Ye Zao continued, “Aunty, if you need help, please let me know.” ”

“”Okay.”Zhou Xiang nodded and smiled. “Don’t worry, Aunty is fine.”She would think of a way to solve Zhou Zuolong’s matter on her own. She did not want to involve ye Zao in it, which would only add to her worries. ”

“After saying that, Zhou Xiang continued, “Zao Zao, then Auntie will leave first. If there’s time, let’s have dinner and watch a movie together.” ”

“Okay.”

“After watching Zhou Xiang’s car disappear from his sight, ye Zao turned around and left. ”

“After thinking for a while, Ye Zao gave Cen Shaoqing a call. ”

“Leader.”

“”I saw Auntie just now.”As Ye Zao spoke, he handed the card to the Uncle Guard. ”

“What happened to my mom?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“Ye Zao continued, “Auntie’s face was injured. It should be... someone hit her.” ”

“Hearing this, Cen Shaoqing’s hand that was flipping through the document stopped. He continued, “You didn’t see wrongly?” ”

“I didn’t see wrongly.”

“Cen Shaoqing continued, “Okay, got it.” ”

“On the other side, in the car. ”

“Zhou Xiang applied the ointment evenly on her face. At that moment, she seemed to have thought of something and picked up her phone to call ye Zao. ”

Ye Zao had just hung up on Cen Shaoqing when he received a call from Zhou Xiang. “Auntie.”

“Zhou xiang continued, “Zao forgot to tell you just now. You must not tell Shaoqing about this. I’m fine. If Shaoqing knew, he would definitely worry for nothing.” ”

“Auntie...”ye Zhuo massaged his temples. “I just hung up on Cen Shaoqing.”

“”It’s fine, it’s fine. I’ll call Shaoqing now to explain.” ”

“After saying that, Zhou Xiang hung up and called Cen Shaoqing. ”

The call was quickly picked up. “Mom.”

“”Shaoqing, I’m fine. You Don’t have to worry.” ”

“”Then what happened to your face?”CEN Shaoqing continued, “Don’t tell me it was a fall. Can a fall fall on your face?” ”

“The words that were about to come out of his mouth were swallowed by Zhou Xiang. He changed his words and said, “Actually, I said that because I was afraid of burning. Actually... it was your grandfather...” ”

“He hit you?”Cen Shaoqing’s voice was a little cold.

“”Not really. I’m your grandfather’s daughter. It’s normal for your grandfather to discipline me. Shaoqing, please don’t misunderstand!” ”

“Although Zhou Zuolong had slapped Zhou Xiang, Zhou Xiang did not hold a grudge against him. ”

Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly. “What happened?”

“”It’s just a small matter,”Zhou Xiang continued, “This is between your grandfather and me. Don’t worry about it!” ”

“At this moment, little Xu turned around and said, “Madam, we’re already at the delong Road Cafe.” ”

“Zhou Xiang said, “Shaoqing, I’m here. Oh right, your uncle is in Beijing. He hasn’t seen burning! If you have time tonight, remember to bring burning home.” ”

“Got it.”

“After hanging up the phone, Zhou Xiang looked at Little Xu. “Little Xu, is the thing on my face still visible?” ”

“”It’s much better than before,”little Xu said. ”

“That’s good.”Zhou Xiang heaved a sigh of relief.

“After getting out of the car, Zhou Xiang came to the cafe. From Afar, she saw Zhou Jinbei sitting by the window. ”

“Jinbei.”Zhou Xiang jogged over.

“”Sis.”When he saw Zhou Xiang, Zhou Jinbei stood up from his chair. ”

It was not until Zhou Xiang sat opposite Zhou Jinbei that Zhou Jinbei realized that Zhou Xiang’s face was covered with injuries.

“Because of the ointment, she no longer looked as scary as before. However, there were still some traces left on her face. “SIS, what happened to your face?” ”

“”Nothing, it’s just a small problem.”Zhou Xiang did not care about her face at all. She continued, “Jinbei, our parents have come to Beijing. Furthermore, our mother is hospitalized. Are you really not going to visit them?” ”

“Actually, Zhou Xiang was thinking for Zhou Jinbei’s sake. ”

Zhou Jinbei and Xie Wanqiu did not have a good relationship to begin with. Zhou Jinbei had specially come to Beijing and did not even bother to look at Xie Wanqiu. This did not make sense.

Zhou Jinbei’s expression was a little ugly. “Xie Wanqiu doesn’t have the qualifications to be my mother.”

“”Jinbei, you’re not young anymore. Why are you so insensible? Father is already so old. How many more years do you think he has?” ”

“Zhou Jinbei looked up at Zhou Xiang and said seriously, “Sis, I suspect that Dad has something to do with Mom’s death.” ”
