Chapter 1862: 379: he was immediately stunned! 5

Translator: 549690339

Was what Qiu Di said true?

Qiu Di walked all the way to the door.

Ye Han was still standing outside.

“Seeing that Qiu di seemed to have cried, ye Han frowned slightly. “Miss, did Shangguan Zhi Bully You?” ”

“”No.”Qiu di said, “Don’t be rude to the Shangguan clan leader in the future.” ”

“With Qiu Di’s words, even if ye Han was angry, he didn’t dare to act rashly. He could only nod and say, “Yes.” ”

“After Qiu di left, the head chief immediately gathered everyone and held a meeting. ”

“After learning of Qiu Di’s words and actions today, everyone discussed animatedly. ”

“What if what Qiu di said is true?”

“”What Qiu di said is indeed very reasonable. Miss ye is so powerful. Other than her own willingness, who else can force her?” ”

“”In that case, Miss ye personally changed ye Han’s memories?” ”

“At this moment, the fifth clan leader stood out and said, “Other than Miss Ye, there’s another person who can also alter ye Han’s memories.” ”

“Who?”The first clan leader asked.

The other five clan leaders were also very curious.

“”The Witch Doctor,”the fifth clan leader said. ”

“”Witch Doctor?”Hearing this, the second clan leader frowned slightly and continued, “But the witch doctor disappeared three years ago.” ”

“Three years ago, after the Witch Doctor lost to Ye Zao, he disappeared without a trace. There was even a rumor that the witch doctor could not face someone who was one round younger than him, so he swallowed medicine and committed suicide! ”

“However, this rumor was not confirmed. ”

“The third patriarch said, “Not to mention that the witch doctor is already dead, even if the Witch Doctor is still alive, he is still not a match for Miss Ye! Otherwise, he would not have lost to miss ye three years ago!” ”

“Hearing this, the other elders nodded their heads in agreement. ”

“The head clan leader continued, “Then how much credibility do you think Qiu Di’s words have?” ”

“The six clan leaders were the first to speak, “I think it’s 70% .” ”

Because Qiu di’s words were reasonable and had evidence.

“Furthermore, ye Zao had given the only pearl on his body to Qiu Di! ”

One had to know that ye Zao viewed that string of pearls as more precious than his own life.

“Since ye Zao was able to give such a precious thing to the autumn flute, it meant that she truly acknowledged the autumn flute! ”

“In the past, they didn’t think that the autumn flute could take the lead and preside over the overall situation. But now, when they heard that the autumn flute was personally entrusted by ye Zao, they felt that the autumn flute could be erected. ”

“After all, Ye Zao’s judgment of people wouldn’t be wrong! ”

The seven clan leaders and eight clan leaders all agreed with the words of the six clan leaders.

The Five clan leaders and the four clan leaders did not speak.

“The second clan leader said, “I feel that you are all a little too anxious. Anyone can tell lies. What if all of this is just a figment of the autumn flute’s imagination?” ”

“The third clan leader followed, “Everyone, do you still remember the prophecy of the fall of the Qiu Clan?” ”

“For thousands of years, there had not been a single ruler with the surname Qiu among the rulers of Changyue. ”

“Hearing this, the crowd fell silent for a moment. ”

“The great clan leader continued to speak, “The Prophecy is just a prophecy after all. Who can guarantee that the prophecy will be 100% successful? Ever since the establishment of changyue, there has been no precedent of women ascending the throne, but doesn’t miss ye still manage Changyue in an orderly manner?” ”

Yes.

“Before ye Zhuo, the rulers of the Chang Yue country throughout the generations were all men. ”

The Chang Yue country did not have a view of true equality between men and women. It was ye Zhuo’s appearance that broke this situation and allowed true equality between men and women to be achieved.

“”But what if the prophecy is fulfilled?”The three clan leaders continued, “The insect race has always been eyeing us with covetous eyes. At present, they still don’t know that something has happened to Miss Ye. If they were to know, a great battle would inevitably occur. Can Qiu di take Miss Ye’s place to fight?” ”

“”You can’t say that,”the eight clan leaders said, “Even if autumn flute doesn’t take the throne, someone must take it. “Could it be that in the entire Chang Yue country, there’s still someone who can replace Miss Ye and start a war with the insect race? “Since autumn flute was personally chosen by Miss Ye, it means that autumn flute definitely has something extraordinary.” ”

These people were absolutely loyal to ye Zhuo.

“Now that they heard that ye Zao personally chose the autumn flute, then no matter how unbearable the autumn flute was, they would all accept it! ”

“For a time, the eight of them argued endlessly. ”

“In the end, the few of them watched the surveillance footage together. ”

“On the surveillance footage, autumn flute’s expression was natural. It really couldn’t be seen that she had any traces of disguise. ”

“Finally, the second patriarch stood out and said, “Didn’t autumn flute say that 16 years ago, she once saved Miss Ye? Then let’s go check now to see if there’s such a thing!” ”

“The first clan leader nodded, and the others nodded in agreement. ”

“Now, there was only one way to go! ”

“With the state of Changyue’s advanced technology, it was not difficult to find out what happened sixteen years ago. ”

“Very quickly, the assistant brought the things that had been investigated and brought them to the first clan leader. ”

“The information showed that sixteen years ago, Ye Zao had indeed stayed at the Qiu family for a whole week, and Qiu Chang Town had indeed thought of keeping ye Zao as a servant for Qiu Di. ”

“But later, for some unknown reason, this idea did not come true. ”

“Could it be that, just as Qiu di had said, she could not bear to see ye Zao, who was the same age as her, become her servant? After ye Zao’s injuries were healed, she let ye Zao Leave? ”

“For a moment, the several clan leaders looked at each other and saw the confusion in each other’s eyes. ”

On the other side.

“Ever since autumn flute left, autumn town had been feeling very uneasy. They were afraid that autumn flute would encounter a problem with Shangguan Jue! ”

“At this moment, they heard the sound of an aircraft outside. Autumn town immediately ran to the door. “Di’er.” ” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Autumn flute came down from the aircraft. “Father.”

“How is it?”Autumn town asked impatiently.

“Qiu di said, “Let’s talk inside.” ”

“Okay.”Qiu Changzhen nodded and followed Qiu di inside.

“After walking inside and closing the door, Qiu Changzhen hurriedly asked, “Di’er, how is it? How did that Old Fox, Shangguan Jue, React?” ”

Qiu Di’s expression was calm. “There shouldn’t be any problem.”

“After all, there were no loopholes in her story and there were traces to follow! ”

The only loophole was ye Zao.

But Ye Zao was already dead!

“Ye Zao’s corpse was still in the liquid nitrogen room. Even if ye Zao wanted to use his corpse to resurrect himself, he didn’t have the conditions! ”

“Seeing Qiu di like this, Qiu Changzhen heaved a sigh of relief. He nodded and said, “Is there really no problem?” ”

“”Yes.”Qiu di continued, “Shangguan Jue and the others are so loyal to ye Zao. I’m also ye Zao’s Savior. They know what to do.” ”

“In fact, Qiu di could be considered half of ye Zao’s Savior! ”

“If she had kept ye Zao as a servant back then, there wouldn’t have been ye Zao, who would be the center of attention later on? ”

“”What about the information on the star-crossing case?”Qiu Changzhen continued, “Did they tell you the password?” ”

“Not yet.”Qiu Di shook her head.

“Not Yet?”Qiu Changzhen frowned.

“It seemed that the eight families still did not trust autumn flute. Otherwise, they would not not have told autumn flute the password to the information on the star-crossing case! ”

“Without the password to the information on the star-crossing case, how could autumn flute conquer everyone in the general election? ”

“Autumn flute turned to look at autumn town and continued, “Father, we can’t rush things like this. We have to take things step by step.” ”

“Although the great patriarch did not tell her the password to the information on the star-crossing case, the Great Patriarch’s performance today told her that the great patriarch was slowly accepting her. ”

“After saying that, Qiu di continued, “Three days. I only want three days! I promise that Shangguan Jue will send all the information and the password to me within three days.” ”

“Really?”Qiu Changzhen expressed his doubt.

“You’ll know when you see it.”Qiu Di smiled.

“Seeing Qiu di’s confidence, Qiu Changzhen narrowed his eyes. ”

“His daughter had never let him down since she was young. This time, she would definitely not let him down! ”

At the CEN residence.

Ye Zhuo came to find Cen Shaoqing as promised to hypnotize him.

“When she arrived at the CEN residence, it was 9:30 in the morning. ”

“When she suddenly saw ye Zhuo, old madam Cen said in surprise, “Ye, why are you here! Shaoqing even said that he would pick you up at 10:30!” ”
