“Okay.”

“After hanging up the phone, her husband sent the card number to her. ”

Liu Meilian immediately sent it to Weiwei.

“”Weiwei, I sent the card number to you.”Liu Meilian walked in with a smile, then, she said, “I just pulled you into our family group. There’s no one else in the group except your uncle and your younger brother and sister. We are a family of five.” ”

Weiwei opened wechat and found that she had indeed been pulled into a family group.

Group name.

A happy family.

Weiwei opened the group and the corners of her mouth curled up.

Husband and wife were loving. They had children. They were indeed a happy family.

“Weiwei looked up at Liu Meilian and said, “Mom, can you introduce your younger brother and sister to me?” ”

“”Okay.”Liu Meilian took out her phone and opened the family photo. “Look, this is your younger brother Zhe Zhe. This is your younger sister Sisi. The two of them...” ”

“When she talked about her two children, Liu Meilian’s eyes were filled with an unconcealable smile. ”

“The corners of Weiwei’s mouth curled up slightly, but she couldn’t tell what it meant. ”

She never knew that Liu Meilian actually had such a maternal side.

She was partial to those two children.

She was very happy now.

“Liu Meilian continued, “Your younger brothers and sisters adore you. Oh right, your younger sister is also a loyal fan of your comics! Previously, she even said that she wanted to meet you, but I was afraid that she would disturb you, so I didn’t let her come over.” ”

“”And your younger brother. Don’t think that he’s only ten years old this year. He’s actually very shrewd. Every day, he says that he wants to be like his sister and become an excellent manga artist.” ”

“Weiwei just looked at her like that. Liu Meilian was immersed in the happiness of having children, so she didn’t notice the ridicule in Weiwei’s eyes. ”

“She was thinking, in Liu Meilian’s previous life, would she occasionally think of herself? ”

“After all, she was Liu Meilian’s daughter. ”

“Wei Wei looked away and said, “Mom, I’m tired. I want to rest.” ”

“”Okay.”Liu Meilian put away her phone and said, “What do you want to Eat Tonight? Mom will buy it for you.” ”

“”Anything.”Wei Wei continued, “But I want to eat your hand-made Ramen Tomorrow.” ”

“Liu Meilian smiled and said, “Okay, then mom will go home tomorrow to make Ramen for you.” ”

“Wei Wei said, “Then when you go home, bring your younger siblings along.” ”

She wanted to see what a child who was favored to grow up looked like.

“Okay.”Liu Meilian nodded.

“When she came out of the ward, Liu Meilian received a call from her husband. “I received a payment from your daughter.” ”

“How much?”Liu Meilian asked.

“”It’s only 15,000 yuan.” ”

“Liu Meilian continued, “Why do you still think it’s too little? Weiwei just had an operation. It’s already good enough that she can make so much money. You’re such a short-sighted person. When Weiwei moves into our house in the future, won’t all her salary be ours!” ”

“”Besides, how much is your salary for a month?” ”

“A person who only received a few thousand yuan a month actually despised 15,000 yuan. It was simply ridiculous. ”

“You’re right.”

“Liu Meilian said again, “Wei Wei said that she wants to eat the ramen that I made personally. Prepare the ingredients tonight. I’ll be back early tomorrow morning.” ”

“”Alright, then I’ll put the beef stewed first.” ”

Liu Meilian gave some more instructions before hanging up.

...

“The next morning, Liu Meilian went home and started making ramen. She also instructed her children to please Wei Wei when they arrived at the hospital and not to speak nonsense. ”

“Her daughter, Sisi, pouted unhappily. “Why should I please her! She’s not my biological sister!” ”

“”Who says she’s not your biological sister? She’s your biological sister!”After saying that, Liu Meilian continued, “Even if she’s not your biological sister, she’s rich! As long as you make her happy, you can have anything you want in the future!” ”

Sisi’s eyes lit up when she heard that. “Then can I have a piano?”

“Sure.”Liu Meilian nodded.

“Sisi jumped up happily. “Oh, that’s great! I’m going to have a piano!” ”

“Zhe Zhe immediately asked, “Then will my biological Sister Buy Me an Ultraman?” ”

“You’re useless. All you know is Ultraman!”Liu Meilian said.

“Zhe Zhe said, “If she buys me Ultraman, then she is my biological sister!” ”

“After making the noodles, Liu Meilian brought her children to the hospital. ”

Wei Wei sat on the hospital bed.

“Liu Meilian brought her children and said, “Sisi Zhe, quickly call me sister.” ”

“Sister.”The two siblings said in unison.

Wei Wei looked at them and took out two red packets. “Here.”

“Seeing the red packets, Liu Meilian’s eyes lit up. “Quick, hurry up and thank sister!” ”
