Translator: 549690339

“After being insulted repeatedly, Duanmu Fengyu almost lost her balance. ”

“Fortunately, she didn’t have a heart attack! ”

“After saying this, old Mrs. Cen looked at Xiao Tao. “Xiao Tao Tao, let’s go.” ”

“OH.”Xiao Tao immediately followed Old Mrs. Cen’s footsteps.

“Looking at Old Mrs. Cen’s back, Duanmu Fengyu stomped his feet in anger. ”

“Old Lady Cen had a smile on her lips. “Xiao Tao Tao, do you believe that Little Que’er is already hopping mad?” ”

“Little Que’er?”Xiao Tao looked at Old Lady Cen in confusion.

“Old Lady Cen explained, “In our hometown, the Sparrow is little Que’er.” ”

“Xiao Tao could not help but laugh. She had thought that old lady cen was an eccentric old lady from Earth, but she did not expect Old Lady Cen to be so kind and amiable. ”

“”Quickly turn around and see if she’s stomping her feet,”old Mrs. Cen continued. ”

“Xiao Tao turned around and saw that Duanmu Fengyu was stomping her feet in anger, and her facial features were almost twisted together. ”

“”You really are a mastermind,”Xiao Tao said. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “That’s a must! I’ve seen many small family birds like her who have no status!” ”

This was the first time Xiao Tao had seen Duanmu Feng lose his composure like that. She couldn’t help but look back.

“Old Mrs. Cen continued to ask, “By the way, let me ask you a question.” ”

“”Old Mrs. Cen, please ask,”Xiao Tao said respectfully. ”

“You must answer truthfully.”

“Don’t worry.”Xiao Tao nodded.

“Old Mrs. Cen said, “Let me ask you, how is the relationship between your master of the General Alliance and that little aunt Que’er?” ”

“Xiao Tao recalled every detail of Cen Haifeng’s relationship with Duanmu Feng and continued, “Well, it’s not too good, but it’s not too bad either. It’s the kind that treats each other like guests.” ”

“Then do they have children?”Old Mrs. Cen continued to ask.

“No.”Xiao Tao shook her head.

Old Mrs. Cen narrowed her eyes. “Doesn’t the General Union of the General Union have any other children?”

“”Yes.”Xiao Tao continued, “The national system is like this. The young master who is qualified to inherit the position of the General Alliance can only be of Earth’s bloodline. Therefore, the General Alliance must get married and have children on Earth, and then the National Master and the Great Elder will bring them back.” ”

“I see.”

“According to Xiao Tao’s words, it could not be analyzed that if CEN Shaoqing had not seen through the secular world, he would have been brought back to the General Alliance long ago. ”

“”Yes, Old Lady, do you have anything else to ask?”Xiao Tao continued to ask. ”

“”No,”old lady cen continued, “Let’s go eat first.” ”

“”Eat?”Xiao Tao asked curiously, “Old Lady, didn’t you drink the nutrient solution when you woke up this morning?” ”

“Nutrient solution?”Old Lady Cen frowned. “That bottle of green stuff?”

“”Yes.”Xiao Tao smiled and explained, “That’s nutrient solution. After drinking a bottle, you won’t feel hungry for a day.” ”

“”That stuff can be drunk?”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “On our earth, that stuff is used to grow flowers.” ”

“When she got up in the morning, she opened the lid and smelled it. That thing smelled even better than the nutrient solution used to grow flowers! ”

“Xiao Tao continued, “Actually, the Changyue Kingdom already has a variety of nutrient solutions with different flavors, but they haven’t been circulated to the General Alliance for the time being. Old Madam, if you’re not used to drinking the original flavor nutrient solution, I can get someone to buy other flavors.” ”

“”No need, no need.”Old Madam Cen waved her hand. “Just take me to my granddaughter-in-law’s Place! She’ll definitely have delicious food there!” ”

Ye Zhuo was never a person who would let himself down.

“”Your granddaughter-in-law?”Xiao Tao was stunned. Could Old Mrs. Cen be referring to Duanmu Fengyu? After all, when Duanmu Fengyu came, he indeed had delicious food from Earth in his hands. ”

“”Don’t you know about my granddaughter-in-law?”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “She’s the most beautiful one who came with US yesterday!” ”

“Xiao Tao finally reacted. She smiled and said, “Is it miss ye Zao?” ” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“”Yes, yes, yes.”Old Mrs. Cen nodded repeatedly. ”

“Xiao Tao continued, “Speaking of Miss Ye Zao, she has the same name as Miss ye from our s galaxy. I heard that they look very similar.” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen said, “Then she’s definitely not as powerful as my granddaughter-in-law!”! Xiao Tao, let me tell you, don’t look at how my granddaughter-in-law doesn’t show off, she is keeping a low profile! She is the most powerful person in the universe! There is no problem that she can’t solve!” ”

The most powerful person in the universe?

“No matter how powerful ye Zhuo was, he only came from Earth. Compared to the famous miss ye of Chang Yue, he was not just a little bit inferior. ”
