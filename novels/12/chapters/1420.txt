The other party did not show any rejection status.

“However, there was no reply either.”

“However, although there was no reply, Zheng Wanyin heaved a sigh of relief.”

She had no choice but to not be blacklisted by Zhou Zuolong.

“As long as she was not blacklisted, it meant that Zhou Zuolong was still thinking of her as his granddaughter.”

“”Grandpa did not delete my wechat,”Zheng Wanyin said.”

“Xie wanqiu nodded, knowing what to do.”

He knew that Zhou Zuolong would not give up on them so easily.

“She was Zhou Zuolong’s favorite woman, and Zheng Wanyin was Zhou Zuolong’s granddaughter!”

“After a while, they arrived at the entrance of the hotel.”

“Zheng Wanyin looked at Xie rongle. “Cousin, take Grandma to the side to rest for a while. I’ll go check in.””

“Okay.”Xie Rongle helped Xie Wanqiu to the lounge area in the lobby.

“Just as they sat down in the lounge area, someone looked over and pointed at them.”

“Why does that person look familiar?”

“She looks like Mr. Zhou’s stepmother!”

“”What do you mean she looks like her? She’s clearly that evil stepmother. She’s too shameless, forcing the original wife to marry into the family! It’s also because Mr. Zhou is kind enough to support them for so many years!””

“”Mr. Zhou had no choice. Didn’t you see how they slandered Mr. Zhou on the internet? Fortunately, Mr. Zhou fixed Ms. Wu’s suicide note. Otherwise, we would have misunderstood Mr. Zhou!””

“There should be a law. All cheating couples who interfere in other people’s marriages should be sentenced to death!”

“The crowd did not deliberately lower their voices, so Xie wanqiu heard it clearly.”

“She had been the wife of a wealthy family for many years, and this was still the best. She was being criticized behind her back.”

Her face felt as if it had been cut by a knife.

It was unbearable.

“However, she could not stand up and fight back.”

Xie wanqiu could only lower her head and pray for Zheng Wanyin to come over quickly.

“However, there was a problem with the payment process at the front desk. It was not until twenty minutes later that Zheng Wanyin jogged over. “Grandma, Cousin.””

“Xie wanqiu stood up and said, “Yinyin, let’s go quickly.””

Zheng Wanyin nodded.

“”That’s Zheng Wanyin, the toad who dreamed of marrying Fifth Master Cen!””

“What an ugly person. Why would fifth master Cen fall for that kind of person!”

“Isn’t it normal for an old and shameless descendant to be a little and Shameless?”

Zheng Wanyin bit her lip.

Just wait.

“The river flows east for thirty years, and the river flows west for thirty years.”

“After she successfully married Cen Shaoqing, she would definitely make all those who had insulted her pay the price!”

“Xie rongle listened to the discussions of the crowd, and his expression was a little ugly. She was with Zheng Wanyin and Xie wanqiu, would she also be criticized by others?”

“”Aunt, yinyin, let’s walk faster!””

The three of them quickly walked towards the elevator.

“Coincidentally, the elevator door was about to close when they went over.”

Zheng Wanyin jogged over and pressed the button. “Please Wait!”

The elevator door opened.

Inside stood three rich ladies with an imposing air. Behind them were a few bodyguards in black suits. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“”Grandma, come in quickly!”Zheng Wanyin helped Xie wanqiu into the elevator.”

“”Wait!”At this moment, a sharp female voice suddenly appeared in the elevator.”

“Zheng Wanyin looked up and saw that the person who spoke was Mrs. Fu, who was wearing sunglasses and a long black down jacket.”

“Normally, Zheng Wanyin would not take such a person seriously, but this time was different from the past.”

“What’s the matter?”

Mrs. Fu adjusted her sunglasses. “Please leave.”

“”Why?”Zheng wanyin said angrily, “What right do you have to ask me to leave?””

“Mrs. Fu continued, “I’m sorry, but we don’t want to share the elevator with a few dogs.””

“”That’s right,”Mrs. Fu said with a smile. “What if they get sick and bite us?””

Dogs?

These people actually called them dogs!

They were simply going too far!

Zheng Wanyin clenched her fists. “Who are you calling dogs?”

“Mrs. Fu, who was wearing sunglasses, turned to look at the bodyguards. “Please get these dogs out of Here!””

“”Yes, Madam!””

“A few security guards immediately came out and pushed Zheng Wanyin, Xie wanqiu, and Xie rongle out of the elevator.”

They looked at the constantly changing numbers on the elevator door.

Zheng Wanyin was so angry that she was about to have a heart attack!

“For the first time in her life, she was scolded by someone pointing at her nose like this.”

Xie wanqiu and Xie Rongle’s faces were also very ugly on the side.
