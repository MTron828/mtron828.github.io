“I know.”

“In the office, everyone was discussing today’s surgery. ”

“I heard that the surgery over there has been successfully completed! Do you guys think that little girl surnamed ye is really that amazing?”

“Some people were already beginning to regret, “Sigh! Why didn’t I apply to join Group A at that time! If I joined Group A, I would be a member of Group A now. When the higher-ups give out bonuses, I would definitely have a share!” ”

“”Little Gu is still smart! She took the initiative to stand up and become the leader of group A. When that time comes, she would be the first doctor in our hospital to cure cancer! From now on, we and Little Gu would be from two different worlds!” ”

“Su Zishan smiled as she walked in from outside, “It hasn’t even been a week yet. Why are you all in such a hurry? If cancer was really that easy to cure, the oncologists in country P wouldn’t have studied it until now! Even my master, William, was helpless against cancer. How could a little girl do it? Now You’re all envious of Xiao Gu. Maybe Xiao Gu will be envious of you too!” ”

Su Zishan didn’t believe ye Zao at all.

She had seen ye Zao once.

Except for his beautiful face.

He was completely useless.

“Therefore, in Su Zishan’s eyes, Ye Zao was an arrogant little girl. ”

“Hearing this, everyone felt that what Su Zishan said made sense. ”

No foreign master could conquer cancer.

How could a little girl?

“Ever since the surgery, Ye Zhuotian would come to the hospital to talk to Zhao Pingting. ”

Zhao Pingting clearly felt that her body was rapidly improving.

First: she was no longer coughing up blood.

Second: she could breathe freely now. There was no longer any obstructing feeling from before.

Third: the pain in her chest had also disappeared.

“Most importantly, her appetite had improved. Before the surgery, nothing she ate tasted good. Now, everything she ate tasted good. ”

“The director of the hospital also came to visit Zhao Pingting once a day. When he saw that Zhao Pingting was getting better, he was very happy. He was waiting for the test in a week’s time. ”

“If the test on Zhao Pingting and the other two patients showed that there were no cancer cells in their bodies, then the highlight of his life would come. ”

He looked forward to the hospital he managed becoming the first hospital in the world to cure cancer!

Zhao Pingting was not the only one who felt better. The other two patients in the same ward also felt that they were recovering rapidly.

They looked at the other two patients who did not receive treatment and felt a little anxious.

Could it be that they were really better?

“”Little girl, are you really alright?”Auntie Cao, who lived in the bed next to Ye Zao, could not help but ask. ”

“Zhao pingting nodded. “Yes! Auntie Cao, I feel like I’m full of strength.” ”

“Auntie Cao hesitated for a moment and said a little embarrassedly, “About that, I want to try it too. Can you tell your friend to arrange an operation for me too?” ”

“Hearing this, another young lady quickly said, “And me!” ”

“Zhao Pingting shook her head regretfully. “I might not be able to. That medicine is only for five people in total. Because you didn’t use it that day, it was already given to others.” ”

“Hearing this, both of their faces turned pale. ”

They were filled with regret.

“Zhao pingting continued, “But don’t worry, Aunties. I will be discharged in a few days. On the day I am discharged, the hospital will test that I have fully recovered. The hospital will definitely mass produce the medicine. At that time, all of you will have the opportunity to have surgery.” ”

“Aunty Cao said, “There are so many people who have cancer! Will the hospital be able to take care of us?”Aunty Cao was very regretful now, if she had received treatment back then, she would be like Zhao Pingting now. She would no longer have to suffer from the pain of her illness. ”

Auntie Cao was not the only one who was regretful. The young woman was also very regretful.

“But now, it was useless to regret! ”

Time passed very quickly.

“In the blink of an eye, a week had passed. ”

“Early in the morning, the Zhao family accompanied Zhao Pingting for a checkup. ”

“Zhao Pingting was lying in the C T machine, feeling a little uneasy. ”

“Similarly, director Zhou and Gu Dening, who were standing beside the machine, were also feeling uneasy. ”

They had to defeat the cancer cells.

“Ye Zhuo was the calmest person in the room. Not only was she not anxious, but she kept her head down to play with her phone. ”

“Soon, the radiologist walked out with the CT report. ”

“Director Zhou immediately walked over. “Doctor Zhang, how is it?” ”

“Doctor Zhang said excitedly, “Miracle! Director Zhou! It’s a miracle! The patient has completely recovered! There are no more infected areas in his lungs!” ”

“Really?”Director Zhou was so excited that his eyes were red.

“”It’s true!”The radiologist handed the CT report to the director. “If you don’t believe me, take a look for yourself!” ”

“When Zhao Yingjun’s parents, Zhao Yingjun, and Tang Jia heard the news, they were also extremely excited. They thanked ye Zao profusely. ”

Director Zhou took the report with trembling hands. “Right away! Inform all the doctors immediately. I want to call an emergency meeting!”

“Okay.”

Director Zhou came to Ye Zhuo’s side again and bowed deeply. “Miss Ye! I thank you on behalf of all the cancer patients! It’s you who gave them a chance at a new life!”

“”This is the responsibility of the doctors. I have already told Doctor Gu everything about the method to conquer cancer. You can discuss with doctor gu about what to do next. If you encounter any problems, just ask doctor Gu to look for me.” ”

“Okay!”Director Zhou said many more words of thanks.

In the office.

“When the assistant director of the hospital informed the doctors of the various departments to attend a meeting, everyone was dumbfounded. ”

Why was there a meeting going on?

Su Zishan narrowed her eyes. She suddenly remembered that today was the day Zhao Pingting and the others were tested and discharged from the hospital.

Could it be that something had happened to Zhao Pingting and the others?

Yes!

Something must have happened.

“Thinking of this, Su Zishan smiled and looked up at her assistant. “Is it about those lung cancer patients?” ”

The assistant nodded. “Yes! Those three cancer patients have all recovered! The director called everyone over because he wants to discuss the press conference with everyone!”
