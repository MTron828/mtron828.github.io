“Chapter 819: 179: face smacking. Lord Five: This is my girlfriend, Ye Zhuo! 4”

Translator: 549690339

Curiosity killed the cat. She hoped that ye Zhuo would remember her words and not run around.

Ye Zhuo’s voice was shallow. “I’ll be careful.”

“Tang Xue added, “Miss Ye, if you accidentally bump into any traps, press the distress button on the wall.””

“Okay.”

Ye Zhuo walked around the few project teams in the R & D Department.

“After ye Zhuo left, Tang Xue took out her phone from her pocket and opened the data analysis diagram, hoping that she could solve the problems that the R & D Department had encountered.”

“If she could solve the problems of the R & D Department, it would definitely make everyone’s eyes light up.”

“However, after looking at it for a long time, she still couldn’t figure out anything. Tang Xue put her phone into her pocket and raised her head to see that ye Zhuo had actually walked to Area C, and her expression immediately changed.”

“Area C was a key project team, and it was also the area with the most traps.”

“As long as ye Zao took a casual step, it was possible to trigger the trap.”

“However, not only did ye Zao take a few steps forward, he even reached out his hand to touch the nuclear weapon on the table.”

Could That Thing be touched casually?

“The table on which the nuclear weapon was placed was arranged with laser beams similar to spider webs. Once the trap was triggered, ye Zao would be cut into pieces by these laser beams!”

“Even if he was lucky and did not get cut into pieces, he would still have his arms and legs broken and become a disabled person.”

“Miss Ye!”Tang Xue quickly ran over.

“If it was anyone else, they would definitely be shocked by the sudden sound and trigger the mechanism. If they touched the laser beams in the dark, they would either die or become disabled.”

“However, not only was ye Zao not scared, he calmly picked up the nuclear weapon on the table.”

It was a nuclear bomb the size of an egg.

“Although this nuclear bomb was only the size of an egg, its power was not small. Once ignited, it could blow up an entire city.”

“Tang Xue looked at the complete ye Zao with a look of disbelief on her face. “Miss Ye, are you alright?””

Ye Zao was actually unharmed!

“Was she lucky, or did she have a technological talent?”

“Logically speaking, it shouldn’t be.”

What kind of technological talent could an eighteen or nineteen-year-old girl have?

Even for her.

“Growing up in a laboratory, she did not have the ability to easily avoid laser beams that could not be seen by the naked eye.”

She did not expect ye Zao’s luck to be so good.

“”It’s fine.”Ye Zao’s expression was still the same. He weighed the nuclear bomb in his hand, his expression as calm as a walnut.”

Tang Xue gulped.

Did Ye Zao know that this nuclear bomb could blow up an entire city?

“”Miss Ye, this is a nuclear bomb. It’s very powerful! Please give it to me quickly. I’ll get the technical team to put it back.””

There were laser beams everywhere on the platform where the nuclear bomb was placed. Tang Xue did not dare to risk her life.

“”It’s just putting it back. There’s no need to alarm the technical team.”As he spoke, ye Zao placed the nuclear bomb on the platform.”

Tang Xue was in a bad mood. It was too late to stop it. She was so scared that she quickly closed her eyes.

It was as if she could hear ye Zao’s scream the next second.

“One second, two seconds, three seconds.”

There was no scream in the air.

Could it be that her throat was directly cut?

“After all, there was only one dumb luck.”

Ye Zao had already used it once. Could it be that there was a second dumb luck?

Tang Xue wondered if Cen Shaoqing would blame her.

Ye Zao was the one who took the nuclear bomb.

She had already told the technical team to put it back. It was ye Zao who was determined to put it back.

“Cen Shaoqing would not blame her, right?”

“She was a high-level experimenter in the experimental base. Cen Shaoqing would not make things difficult for her because of ye Zao, right?”

“”Miss Tang?”At this moment, a clear voice appeared in the air.”

Tang Xue was stunned?

Was this ye Zao’s voice?

Tang Xue opened her eyes and saw ye Zao standing in front of her in perfect condition. Not even a strand of hair had fallen off. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

What was going on?

Ye Zao was not injured at all.

Tang Xue’s gaze fell on the platform. She saw that the nuclear bomb had been returned to her in one piece.

Could it be that the mechanism had been turned off in advance?

“If it had not been turned off, would ye Zao be unscathed?”

“Tang Xue frowned, wanting to test if the mechanism had been switched off. However, she did not dare to use her own hands to conduct the experiment. Thus, she could only pick up the test tube on the side of the table and stretch it over.”

Pa Pa —

“The moment Shi Guang touched the table, she was sliced into several pieces and fell to the ground.”

There was no problem with the mechanism.

Then what was going on?

Tang Xue raised her head to look at Ye Zao.

“Ye Zao seemed to have seen the doubt in Tang Xue’s eyes and smiled slightly. “No matter how good the mechanism is, there will always be a loophole.””

Loophole?

Could it be that ye Zao was also a Technologist?

“However, she had been in the industry for so long and had never heard of ye Zao. Moreover, no matter how powerful a technologist was, they would not be able to determine the location of the laser beam with the naked eye.”
