“Fortunately, she woke up in time and followed Qiu Di. ”

“Qiu Di was simply the greatest benefactor in her life, her second-born parents! ”

“In fact, ye Lan already knew that she was not an ordinary person. ”

“When she was very young, she often dreamed at night, she was the daughter of a rich and powerful family who got lost. ”

In the dream.

“After she got lost, her family was very sad. ”

She desperately wanted to be reunited with her family.

“But in the dream, she was like a transparent person. No matter how much she shouted, her parents could not see her. ”

“After she woke up from the dream, she sat on the street and cried. ”

That kind of day still makes me feel sad when I think about it.

“At that time, she only knew that she was not an ordinary person, but she never thought that her status would be so noble! ”

She was actually the Manxing Kingdom’s direct princess!

It was not surprising that ye Zao would be jealous of her.

She was already a princess!

Only ye Zao was that pitiful little orphan girl that no one wanted!

She was a princess!

How could ye Zao compare to her!

“On this side, looking in the direction where ye Lan left, Zhou Qing turned his head to look at Qiu di and asked doubtfully, “Eldest miss, is ye Lan really the Manxing Kingdom’s Missing Direct Princess?” ”

“Just her?”Qiu Di snorted coldly. “Is she even worthy?”

She didn’t even have the right to carry shoes for the Manxing Kingdom’s direct princess.

Daydreaming!

“Then you?”Zhou Qing looked at Qiu di with some confusion.

“Qiu Di narrowed his eyes. “Did I say that she was the Manxing Kingdom’s direct princess? All of this is just a guess!”Besides, it was also true that the Manxing Kingdom had lost a princess! ”

“Zhou Qing nodded and said worriedly, “Paper can not hide fire. What if ye Lan finds out one day?” ”

This kind of thing could not be hidden forever.

“Don’t worry about this problem.”Qiu Di did not care at all.

“By the time ye Lan found out the truth, she would already be the female monarch of Changyue Kingdom! ”

“At that time, what could ye Lan Do with her? ”

Zhou Qing nodded.

“”Then, do we really not need to worry about Joey?”Zhou Qing was a little worried. ”

She always felt that this Joey did not come with good intentions. It was not that simple.

“How many days do you think a grasshopper can survive after autumn?”Qiu Di raised his head to look at Zhou Qing.

Wasn’t it fun to watch them kill each other?

“Zhou Qing gave a thumbs up. “High! High! Young Miss, this move of yours is really too high!” ”

The corners of Qiu Di’s lips curled up.

On the other side.

“Ye Zao successfully brought everyone out of the base. After giving a few instructions, he turned around to leave ”

“”Sister, please wait a moment.”Li Zi Yue walked forward. ”

Ye Zao looked back slightly. “Is there anything else?”

“”First of all, thank you for saving us all today.”Li Zi Yue bowed to ye Zao. ”

“If it wasn’t for her, they might really have been silenced by ye LAN today. ”

“At this point, Ye Lan was capable of doing anything! ”

Ye Zhuo reached out to help him up. “Miss Ye has done me a favor. This is what I should do.”

The current her could not reveal her true appearance to others.

She still had to wait.

“When the time was right, she would definitely give them an explanation. ”

“Li Zi Yue looked at ye Zhuo and felt that she was very familiar, especially that pair of eyes. However, upon closer inspection, he felt that she did not look like anyone else ”

Why did she give him such a strange feeling

“If it was not for the fact that his face was not right, Li Ziyue would even feel that the person in front of him was ye Zao. ”

“”Little girl,”at this moment, the weak old dai said, “You saved all of us today. May I ask, can you tell us your name?” ”

“”My name is Joey,”ye Zao said. ”

“Old Dai continued, “Is it joy of Big Qiao and Little Qiao?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Joy...”old Dai repeated it in his heart before turning to look at Ye Zhuo. “Is it joy of Joy?”

“”Yes,”ye Zhuo answered. ”

“Upon hearing this, Old Dai seemed to have thought of something and continued, “Miss Qiao, I seem to have seen you by Miss Ye’s side before.” ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Yes.”

“Old Dai said, “No wonder, no wonder!”He couldn’t believe how familiar they were. ”

“Ye Zhuo glanced at old dai and continued, “Old man, pay attention to your rest during this period of time. The medicine I gave you, three times a day, forbidden spicy food.” ”

“”Okay.”Old Dai nodded. “Thank you, Miss Qiao.” ”

“”I should be the one thanking you.”Ye Zhuo continued, “Thank you for your trust in Miss Ye. I believe that Miss Ye will not disappoint you.” ”

“Hearing this, Li Zi Yue immediately raised his head to look at Ye Zhuo. ”

“”Sister Qiao, do you know where Miss Ye Is?” ” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Ye Zhuo shook his head slightly. “I’m not sure either.”
