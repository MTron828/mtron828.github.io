“Chapter 1214: 257: face-smacking, she was the target of everyone’s expectations. Zhao Xueyin was dumbfounded! 2”

He did not want to save Han Dongliang?

Unless Han Laoshan went crazy.

No!

It was impossible. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Zhao Xueyin took a deep breath and tried hard to calm herself down.

“As Han Laoshan stood up, the shareholders behind him also stood up. “We also support President Ye.” ”

“And US.”

“On the big screen, the votes of the two people kept rolling. In a moment, the screen stopped moving. ”

Zhao Xueyin: 16 votes.

Ye Zhuo: 32 votes.

Looking at the numbers on the big screen.

Zhao Xueyin’s entire body was trembling.

It wasn’t an illusion.

It wasn’t an illusion.

“Before Zhao Xueyin could react, elder Zhang stood up and looked at Ye Zhuo. “Congratulations, President Ye, for taking up the position of Chief of Shunxi Financial Group!” ”

“”Thank you for Your Trust.”Ye Zao faced everyone and bowed slightly. “In the coming days, I hope that we can work together happily and walk towards a new future together.” ”

Clap Clap Clap Clap —

Deafening applause came from below the stage.

“I believe that Chief Ye will lead everyone to a new glory!”

“I believe too!”

“”Congratulations, Chief Ye.” ”

Everyone stood up and congratulated ye Zao. The way they addressed ye Zao had changed from President Ye to First Seat Ye.

“If it had been three months ago, perhaps no one would have chosen ye Zao. ”

It was ye Zao who had used his strength to conquer everyone!

“Although she was young, her abilities were not inferior to everyone present. ”

“From the beginning to the end, ye Zao had an indifferent expression on her face. ”

“Even if she steadily sat in the lead seat, she was still unperturbed by the crowd’s congratulations. It was as if there was nothing remarkable about sitting in the lead seat. ”

Qing Jun’s face was full of calmness that did not match his actual age.

“Thank you.”

“Below the stage, Han Laoshan raised his head to look at Ye Zao. His eyes were full of gratification. ”

“Obviously, this result was expected by everyone. ”

“Whether it was her business ability, the way she conducted herself, or her bearing, Zhao Xueyin was not inferior to ye Zao at all. ”

“At the very least, Ye Zao would not use the matter of treating Han Dongliang to threaten her. ”

Zhao Xueyin’s actions were clearly the actions of a villain!

Zhao Xueyin could not hear the following words clearly. Her blood flowed backwards.

“She was clearly sitting in the conference room, but it was as if she was in a different world from everyone else. ”

Ye Zao.

It was actually ye Zao.

She never expected that she would lose to ye Zao again.

Why?

Ye Zao became the chief.

What about her?

Who Was She?

Zhao Xueyin clenched her fists tightly.

And Han Laoshan.

Could it be that he did not want to save Han Dongliang?

Why did things turn out this way.

“Until the end of the election and all the shareholders had left, Zhao Xueyin was still unable to react. Her face was pale and without any color. ”

“Miss Zhao.”Annie walked over and called out to Zhao Xueyin.

Only then did Zhao Xueyin react. She stood up and walked out of the meeting room.

She couldn’t just watch as ye Zao sat in the chief seat.

This seat was hers.

The Shunxi Financial Group was also hers!

Why did ye Zao have the right to steal her things?

Why!

“When she thought of the person she hated the most, sitting in the seat she wanted the most, Zhao Xueyin almost couldn’t breathe. It was unbearable. ”

She had to find Han Laoshan and make him take back the most crucial vote and start the election again!

She still had an Gong’s bezoar pill in her hands.

Could Han Laoshan really disregard his own son?

Annie immediately followed Zhao Xueyin’s footsteps.

“Get lost! Don’t follow me!”Zhao Xueyin suddenly turned to look at Annie. Her facial features were ferocious.

Annie was shocked and immediately stopped in her tracks.

“Zhao Xueyin came to Han Laoshan’s office. “Uncle Han, don’t you want to save Big Brother Han? I’ll give you another chance...” ”

“”I’m sorry, I’m afraid I’ll have to disappoint you.”Han Laoshan directly interrupted Zhao Xueyin’s unfinished words, “President Ye, oh no! Chief Ye’s medical skills are superb. She has already woken Dongliang up. You should keep your an gong bezoar pill for your own life!” ”

That’s right.

Han Dongliang had already woken up.

“Otherwise, Han Laoshan would not have chosen ye Zhuo without any worries. ”

The reason why he was crying loudly in the office was because he was too excited!

“Even when his son was sick, he had never cried like this. However, when he heard that his son had woken up, Han Laoshan could not control himself. ”

“Before this, he had never experienced what it meant to cry from extreme joy. ”

“Now, he finally experienced it deeply. ”

“Han Laoshan was extremely happy now. However, he had listened to Chen Qiaoye’s words and demolished the sterile room. He believed in ye Zhuo’s diagnosis. ”
