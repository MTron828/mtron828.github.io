“Chapter 1594: 340: returning to her previous life, so the cause and effect was for her! 3”

Translator: 549690339

“”You wretched girl, why didn’t you mention the word ‘old’?”Old Mrs. Cen patted Baizhi’s head. “She’s just a little girl!””

“”What little girl!”Baizhi smiled and said, “I think it’s more like an old monster!””

“As they spoke, the two sisters began to quarrel again, neither giving way to the other.”

“Although they were quarreling, the expression between their eyes was full of happiness.”

On the other side.

Song Shiyu was sitting in the top-floor office.

“”What’s wrong, third brother? I was right! This ZY technology company is a dark horse in the industry. We’ve only been working together for two years, and it’s already brought us so much profit!”Bai Jiayu handed song Shiyu a document.”

Song Shiyu reached out and took it. His slender fingers tapped lightly on the document. “Have you found ZY’s behind-the-scenes founder yet?”

“”No.”Bai Jiayu shook his head, “ZY is getting bigger and bigger. As the saying goes, a tall tree attracts the wind. There are many people in the industry who are investigating ZY’s behind-the-scenes boss, but they haven’t come up with any results. But it makes sense. ZY’s founder can develop ZY so well, so he must not be a small fry. If it’s so easy for others to find out, he won’t Be Zy’s founder anymore!””

“Song Shiyu didn’t say anything. He narrowed his eyes, peeled a piece of candy, and put it into his mouth.”

“Bai Jiayu felt sick of it. “Third brother, are you sure you don’t like Candy?”Song Shiyu wasn’t someone who liked candy in the past.”

“”Low blood sugar, don’t you understand?”Song Shiyu glanced at him.”

“Bai Jiayu said, “Even if it’s low blood sugar, you don’t have to have one every now and then!”At this point, Bai Jiayu put his hands on the desk and looked at song Shiyu with a wicked smile, “Third brother, tell me honestly. Does the girl you have a crush on like eating candy?””

“Can’t you think of anything else other than these messy things?”

“Bai Jiayu continued, “There’s a party tonight. Boss Yuan has invited many girls over. I heard they are all innocent college students who have never been in a relationship before. Third Brother, do you want to come?””

“Not interested.”Song Shiyu picked up a document and read it slowly. “You don’t have to tell me about such things in the future.”

“Bai Jiayu sized up song Shiyu from head to toe and asked, “Third brother, is there something wrong with you?””

“He was almost 30 years old, but Song Shiyu had never even touched a woman...”

How did he do it?

“Song Shiyu raised his eyes slightly and said, “Get lost.””

“Even though it was just one word, it made Bai Jiayu shudder.”

“Bai Jiayu immediately shut up. “I’ll Scram, I’ll scram, I’ll scram right now!””

He knew song Shiyu too well.

“If he didn’t scram, song Shiyu would fall out with him faster than flipping through a book.”

“However, Bai Jiayu’s biggest concern now was whether there was a problem with him.”

If there was no problem with song Shiyu.

Who was he keeping his virginity for?

“Song Shiyu wouldn’t want to die alone like this, right?”

“Thinking of this, Bai Jiayu scratched his head.”

“Just as Bai Jiayu left, his assistant rushed to song Shiyu’s office.”

“”Boss, something happened!””

“Take your time.”Song Shiyu picked up his cup and took a sip of tea.

It was a very fragrant green tea.

No wonder she liked it so much.

“The assistant continued, “Mu Yourong has escaped from prison!””

“What?”Song Shiyu narrowed his eyes.

“The assistant said, “The Yun Jing police called and said that Mu Yourong might have already arrived in the capital.””

“The ink in song Shiyu’s eyes surged, and he immediately picked up the microphone on the table.”

...

Mu Yourong had indeed escaped. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“She had just been reborn with great difficulty, so how could she compromise so easily.”

“She had the memories of her previous life. As long as she planned ahead, it was actually very easy to escape from prison.”

“Even if she died, she had to drag ye Zao along.”

“Mu Yourong pulled her mask, avoiding the checkpoint and walking forward quickly.”

“Up until now, Mu Yourong still could not understand how she, who had been reborn, had become like this.”

“Right now, she was living a life worse than a dog!”

“And that trash who had died tragically at her hands in her previous life, in this life, it was as if he had been cheated. He had flourished all the way, not only becoming a big streamer, but also becoming the famous professor YC.”

Mu Yourong had thought a lot during these two years in prison.

The only explanation was that ye Zao definitely had an extremely powerful system.

Ye Zao’s achievements today were all given by the system!

“Otherwise, ye Zao would not have become the center of attention.”

“After all, other than the variable ye Zao, everything else was the same as what she had experienced in her previous life.”
