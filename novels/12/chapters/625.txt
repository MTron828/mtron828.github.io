“Old Lady Lin continued, “Bai Tang, I know that you’re embarrassed to say it out loud because we’ve been old friends for many years. It’s alright. If you’re embarrassed to say it out loud, I’ll say it! Don’t talk about you. I myself also think that Zhuo Zhuo Zhuo doesn’t deserve Shaoqing!””

“From Old Lady Lin’s point of view, Old Lady Cen definitely didn’t like ye Zao.”

“After all, ye Zao came from a small place.”

He had no manners and no manners.

“If it wasn’t for her face, Old Lady Cen would definitely not agree.”

“Hearing this, Old Lady Cen became anxious. “How can you say that, Old Lady? When did I think that ye Zao doesn’t Deserve Shaoqing? It should be that Shaoqing doesn’t deserve ye Zao!””

“Old Mrs. Lin smiled and said, “Stop pretending! Don’t worry, I Won’t Blame You! Because I also feel that ye Zhuo is indeed not worthy of Shaoqing!”Old Mrs. Lin knew that old Mrs. Cen was giving her a way out.”

“They had been old friends for so many years, so it was normal for old Mrs. Cen to care about her face.”

“”Don’t you understand human language?”Old Mrs. Cen stood up from the sofa anxiously, “I said that I like Yezi very much! For Yezi to become our Cen family’s granddaughter-in-law, it is simply a great virtue of our ancestors! If we say that she isn’t worthy, it is also because our young master isn’t worthy of Yezi! What’s wrong with you?””

“Old Lady Cen was afraid that if Old Lady Lin’s words reached ye Zao’s ears, Ye Zao would misunderstand her!”

“Old Lady Lin only thought that Old Lady Cen was speaking with her heart in her mouth and continued to give her face in front of others, she then said, “Bai Tang, we are about to become a family. A family does not speak of two families. I think that Xianxian is more suitable for Shaoqing than ye Zao. Xianxian is sensible and obedient, gentle and generous. She also knows how to be filial to her elders. Shaoqing is also lucky that Shaoqing married her.””

“In Old Lady Lin’s opinion, Feng Xianxian was many times better than ye Zao.”

“In terms of filial piety, ye Zhuo could not compare to Feng Qianxian.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“”What is this?”Old Lady Cen looked at Old Lady Lin with unusual excitement and directly interrupted her words, “Have you, this old lady, become mentally deranged from drinking medicine every day? Feng Qianxian? Who does Feng Qianxian think she is! She can’t even compare to one of Ye Zi’s little fingers! “You want Shaoqing to marry her? In your dreams! “Even if he pays her, our Shaoqing won’t even spare her a second glance!””

“Old Mrs. Cen said angrily, “Zhao fangyue! “Yezi is your biological granddaughter! “She actually helped outsiders poach her biological granddaughter’s husband. How can there be a grandmother like you in the world? “Our granddaughter-in-law is really unlucky to have such a blind grandmother like you!””

Old Mrs. Cen was so angry that she wanted to beat Old Mrs. Lin up.

“At the same time, she felt sad for ye Zao.”

Ye Zao was such an outstanding and likable child.

How could he have such a good grandmother?

It was fine if a good granddaughter was someone else’s!

“But now, someone else’s grandmother still didn’t know how to cherish it.”

Infuriating!

Really infuriating!

“”I’m telling the truth!”Old Lady Lin stood up from the sofa, “Ye Zhuo just came back from a small place. He can have anything he wants. How could she be worthy of Shaoqing? “Moreover, Xianxian was the one who knew Shaoqing first. If it wasn’t for ye Zhuo’s interference, Xianxian might have already become Shaoqing’s fiancée! “Bai Tang, I know that you’re concerned about our friendship, but I don’t wish for our friendship to affect the matters of the two juniors! “I’m telling you this from the bottom of my heart!””

One thing led to another. Old Lady Lin did not want Old Lady Cen to pretend to be very satisfied with ye Zhuo just because she was concerned about their friendship.

This was meaningless.

“Besides, she was not the kind of person who would extort favors in return.”

“Old Lady Cen was so angry that her face was red and her neck was thick. Her blood pressure soared, and she could not say a word for a long time.”

She really could not understand why there was such a grandmother like old Mrs. Lin in this world!

“Seeing her like this, old Mrs. Lin thought that old Mrs. Cen had tacitly agreed to her words, then, she said, “Then this matter is settled. Tell Shaoqing to quickly break up with Ye Zhuo! Xianxian is the most suitable person for her! “Although Xianxian is not my biological granddaughter, in My Heart, she is even closer to me than my biological granddaughter. In the future, our relationship will only become more intimate and not estranged!””

“”Bah! Friendship? who has a relationship with an old fool like you? With a person like you, you are worthy to be Yezi’s grandmother!”Old Lady Cen pointed angrily at Old Lady Lin, “Zhao fangyue! I say, is there something wrong with your brain? ! Brain is like water, small brain is like fish! When you are young, you are stupid, but when you are old, you are still as stupid! With a granddaughter like Yezi, you are blind and don’t know how to cherish it. Sooner or later, you will regret it!””
