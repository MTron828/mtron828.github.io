“I don’t know.”Man Wen shook his head.

The current situation was very unclear.

Who would benefit the most if something happened to his parents?

Could it be...

“Not knowing what to think, Man Wen immediately patted his head. ”

It couldn’t be.

It shouldn’t be her.

“Even if she had some tricks up her sleeve, no matter how scheming and shrewd she was, she wouldn’t make a move on her biological parents. ”

“Fan Mu continued, “Then what do you plan to do now?” ”

“Man Wen asked, “What do you mean, what do I plan to do?” ”

“”It’s just your parents,”fan mu said. ”

“Don’t you have my sister?”Man Wen asked.

Fan Mu nodded. “This kind of thing should really let your second sister shine in the limelight.”

“As Man Jiangshan and Zhao Dan were still in the state of atonement, they had yet to complete their ten-year prison sentence. In addition, man Xing was at a special time, so the funeral was not suitable for a grand funeral. Everything could only be simplified. ”

“At the funeral, man Xing fainted more than once and was reported by many media outlets. ”

“Facing the camera, mAN XING said, “Of course, they were wrong, but the dead are already dead. From another perspective, they are my parents after all. If it was not for their upbringing, I would not be the person I am now. I’m sorry, everyone. As a daughter, I really can not remain indifferent! “Please forgive me!” ”

“At this point, Manxing bowed to everyone. ”

“[ Miss Manxing, you don’t have to worry. We all understand your current mood. The most important thing for you now is to take good care of your body and prepare for the upcoming election in your best condition! We will all support you! ] ”

“[ Miss Manxing, it’s really not easy. You’re afraid of being scolded even if you cry properly. ] ”

“[ the sun always shines after a storm. Miss Manxing, your life has just begun. Please feel sorry for your loss. ] ”

“Master Cao flipped through everyone’s comments on Manxing, and the corners of his mouth curled up. ”

It seemed that he did not hold a high position in the hearts of everyone.

Manxing was so popular in Manxing!

It seemed that Manxing was determined to win the election.

“Soon, it was the day of the election. ”

Manxing and Manwen arrived as promised. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Together with them were Manfei and manzaibang.

“”First cousin, second cousin.”Manxing stood up and greeted them in a friendly manner. ”

“Manfei smiled and said, “Cousin Xing ‘er, if you sit in that position, you must remember to promote your cousin.” ”

“Thank you for second cousin’s favor. The situation is uncertain. The four of US might be able to do it.”Man Xing said very modestly.

“Man Fei looked around and continued, “I’ll pass. I’m just here to make up the numbers. As for man Wen, he’s not even as good as me! Now it’s up to you and eldest cousin!”Speaking up to this point.., man Fei lowered his voice and continued, “Cousin Xing ‘er, pay attention to man zaibang. He’s not as simple as you think!” ”

“Mm.”Man Xing nodded and glanced at man zaibang without leaving a trace.

Could it be that man Zaibang was the one who was hiding his true strength?

“From the looks of it, man Zaibang was indeed different from before. ”

Man Xing frowned slightly.

“Master Cao walked over and said in a low voice, “Relax. Our efforts over the past few days were not in vain.” ”

“En.”Man Xing nodded.

“On this side, Fan Mu and Wen Yang also saw that man Zaibang was not right. “Does this kid have a backer? Look at that calm and composed look!” ”

“Wen Yang said, “Don’t tell me, he really does!” ”

“Fan Mu asked curiously, “Who?” ”

“”I heard that he has some relationship with Leo,”wen Yang continued, “His second brother-in-law seems to be related to Leo. Anyway, it’s not simple.” ”

“Fan Mu sighed. “Now, Manwen can only wait for Miss Ye to come and save the situation!” ”

“Do you think Miss Ye will come?”Wen Yang asked.

“I don’t know.”Fan Mu shook his head.

“Wen Yang continued, “I don’t think she will come!” ”

“Fan Mu looked in the direction of the door, his eyes filled with anticipation. ”

“Whether it was for public or private reasons, he hoped that ye Zhuo could come. ”

“Wen Yang was right. Li Man’s sudden appearance meant that as long as ye Zao investigated, he would definitely be able to find man Wen. ”

“Although Man Wen said that he did not want to know ye Zao, he actually cared very much about his sister, Ye Zao. ”

“Otherwise, he would not have done so much for ye Zao. ”

“However, ye Zao seemed to be really like what Wen Yang said. He did not care about man Wen at all. ”

On the other side.

Ye Zao contacted Leo and Ye Han. “You guys will go out with me.”

“Where to?”Leo asked curiously.

Ye Zao looked back slightly. “Come with me to support people.”
