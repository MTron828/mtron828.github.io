“Thank you for your hard work.”

“”What are you talking about, Father Zhuo! We are all on the same side!” ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “After this is done, I will definitely thank all of you.” ”

“After receiving ye Zhuo’s orders, the few of them went back to investigate Li Man. ”

On the other side.

Manxing country.

Fan Mu contacted Man Wen. “Your eldest sister seems to know something and is also looking for Aunt Man.”

“Have they found anything?”Man Wen asked.

“Fan Mu shook her head, “Even we don’t have any clues about Aunt Man, how could they possibly find anything! Also, did you see that your eldest sister and your mother are going to meet in court on Friday! It looks like your eldest sister will not be able to escape this time!” ”

“Before the paternity test report, Ye Zhuo did not admit that man Jiangshan and his wife were her parents, so it was understandable that she did not recognize them. ”

Once it was confirmed...

Ye Zao would definitely be at a disadvantage.

Man Wen frowned. “Where would aunt man go?”

“Fan Mu sighed. “Right now, we are in the open while Aunt Man is in the dark. It’s easy for her to hide from us. She might change her name.” ”

“Have you been to Aunt Man’s hometown?”Man Wen asked.

“Yes.”Fan Mu nodded. “She doesn’t have any relatives in her hometown anymore.”

Man Wen touched his chin. “You must dare to find Aunt Man before Friday.”

“”I’ll try my best,”fan mu said. ”

The S galaxy was so big. To find a person was like looking for a needle in a haystack.

“It’s not trying.”Man Wen raised his head to look at Fan Mu. “It’s necessary. You must find Aunt Man.”

“Fan Mu was stunned when he suddenly saw man Wen. He nodded and said, “Alright, Alright, Alright! Don’t worry. I’ll definitely find Aunt Man before the court starts on Friday.” ”

Fan Mu sighed after he said that. “I don’t know why you’re Doing This!”

“Fan Mu thought that man Wen would not answer such a question. However, at this moment, man Wen continued, “To feel at ease.” ”

He was hiding it from his family. This was what he should do.

Fan Mu shook his head helplessly.

“If he was man Wen, he would definitely not do such a nameless hero thing. ”

“At the very least, he had to let ye Zhuo know. ”

“In Ye Zhuo’s eyes, the current man Wen should be no different from the disgusting faces of the entire family. ”

He felt injustice for man Wen.

“”Why don’t I Go and talk to your sister?”Fan Mu asked tentatively, “You’re brother and sister after all. The mistakes you made back then were all your parents’fault. It has nothing to do with you. You’re treating her so well now. She shouldn’t hold a grudge against you.” ”

“”You’re not allowed to go,”man Wen said. ”

“Why?”Fan Mu was a little speechless. “Don’t you feel that what you’re doing now is very silly?” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Man Wen looked at fan mu and said very seriously, “What I’m doing now is not to move her, nor is it to make her remember me.” ”

He just wanted to make himself feel less guilty.

He wanted ye Zhuoyu to live more wantonly so that he would not be implicated by these people from the man family.

That was all.

“After saying that, man Wen continued, “Fan Mu, if you dare to say anything more, our friendship will end here.” ”

“Although it was a light sentence and did not carry much weight, it made fan mu stunned. ”

Fan Mu knew that man Wen was not joking with him. He meant what he said.

“”Since you said so, can I say anything else?”Fan Mu looked at man Wen and said, “Don’t worry, I definitely won’t say anything else outside!” ”

Man Wen did not say anything else.

“On this side, man Xing contacted Mr. Feng. ”

“Mr. Feng.”

“Miss Man Xing.”Mr. Feng smiled and looked at man Xing on the other end of the screen.

“Manxing continued, “Mr. Feng, I’m really sorry. Please tell Miss ye that I’ll definitely think of a way to persuade my parents. Tell her not to be anxious and not to be angry. I’ll apologize to her on behalf of my parents.” ”

“Manxing’s sudden apology stunned Mr. Feng for a moment. After a moment, Mr. Feng smiled and said, “Miss Manxing is too polite. You Don’t owe miss ye anything. There’s no need to apologize to her. I’ll bring it to her for you.” ”

“”Thank you, Mr. Feng.” ”

“Miss Manxing is too polite.”

“After cutting off the connection, Leo immediately walked over. “It’s said that there’s no good person in the entire family. I think Manxing is an exception!” ”

Mr. Feng smiled and did not say anything.

“Mo Gilan continued, “Clan leader Lei, do you think Manxing is a good person?” ”

“She’s not a good person?”Leo asked back.

“Mojiran continued, “Dogs that bite usually don’t bark. The real bad person would never write the word ‘bad person’on his face.” ”
