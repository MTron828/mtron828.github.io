“”You’re welcome. Your grandfather and I were very good partners when we were young.”Father Zhao waved his hand, then, he said, “It just so happens that I want to go up too. Young Man, why don’t you come up with me? I’ll bring you to President Ye’s office.” ”

Grandfather?

Did this old man misunderstand something?

“But Ye Sen didn’t think too much about it and followed Father Zhao’s footsteps. “Alright, I’ll have to trouble you.” ”

Father Zhao was sitting in the exclusive elevator of the upper level.

The sealed elevator was a little quiet.

“Just as Ye Sen was about to say something, Father Zhao spoke at this moment, “How is Your Mother’s health recently? Time has passed quickly. If I count it, we haven’t seen each other for 10 to 20 years!” ”

Ye Sen was stunned.

His mother?

Father Zhao was referring to Zhu Cuihua?

But Zhu Cuihua was just an ordinary rural woman.

She shouldn’t know anyone from the Shunxi Financial Group.

“Ye Sen continued, “My mother’s name is Zhu Cuihua. Are You sure you know her?” ”

Zhu Cuihua?

Father Zhao narrowed his eyes. “Isn’t your mother ye Langhua?”

Ye Sen immediately understood. “Ye Langhua is my godmother! My biological mother is just an ordinary person!”

Father Zhao reacted at this moment.

It turned out that Ye Sen was the child of Ye Shu’s adoptive parents. He was not related to ye Langhua by blood.

“”So it was a misunderstanding!”Father Zhao smiled and said, “Then how is Your Godmother’s health recently?” ”

“Ye Sen said, “She’s in good health. You Don’t have to worry about her.” ”

Father Zhao nodded. “Then I’m relieved.”

“After saying that, father Zhao continued, “Young man, how old are you today?” ”

“Ye Sen politely said, “Old Sir, my name is Ye Sen, from the forest. You Can Call Me Little Ye. I’m thirty-two years old this year.” ”

Thirty-two?

“Hearing this number, Father Zhao was stunned. ”

“If his A Ye was still around, he would be thirty-two years old this year. ”

Ding —

“At this moment, the elevator door opened. ”

“Please.”Ye Sen pressed the elevator door and let Father Zhao go out first.

Father Zhao looked at Ye Sen and then walked out.

Ye Sen followed him out.

“Father Zhao continued, “President Ye’s office is over here. Follow me.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Sen nodded and followed Father Zhao’s footsteps.

They took a turn.

“Father Zhao pointed at the red wooden door at the end of the corridor and said, “Xiao Ye, this is President Ye’s office.” ”

“Ye Sen said, “Thank you for bringing me up.” ”

“Father Zhao smiled and said, “We’re all on the same side. There’s no need to be so polite.” ”

“Then I’ll go in first.”

“Okay.”Father Zhao nodded.

Ye Sen turned around and walked inside.

“The moment ye Sen turned around, the smile on Father Zhao’s face disappeared completely and was replaced by a sinister look. ”

Although ye Sen was not ye Langhua’s biological son.

But his surname was ye after all.

“As long as his surname was ye, then he could pass down the ye family. ”

Unlike him.

“Other than Zhao Xueyin, there was no other heir. ”

He didn’t even have a nephew.

“Not only was Ye Sen’s surname Ye, he was also ye Langhua’s godson. ”

“Although he was called a godson, he was actually no different from his biological son. ”

“After all, Ye Sen and ye Shu had been siblings for so many years. ”

More importantly...

“Through their short time together, he could see that Ye Sen was not a minor character. ”

He was a person with a strong business background.

The future ye family would still be a high-class family.

And their Zhao family...

Was about to be destroyed in his hands.

The water splashed by the daughter that was married off.

Why?

Why did ye Manshan take all the good things for himself?

Father Zhao’s face was full of unwillingness!

“His heart was filled with mixed feelings, so uncomfortable that he could hardly breathe. ”

If only his A Ye was still here!

“Thinking of this, Father Zhao’s face was full of pain. ”

“This kind of pain of losing one’s own flesh and blood, perhaps no one could understand. ”

“If his A Ye was still here, then why would he be jealous of Ye Manshan? ”

Why would god treat him like this?

Father Zhao took a deep breath.

He tried his best to calm himself down.

After a long while.

Father Zhao slowly moved his feet and turned around to leave.

On the other side.

Ye Sen stretched out his hand and knocked on the office door.

“Very soon, the door opened. ”

The person who opened the door was millet. “May I know who you are?”

“I’m President Ye’s uncle. is president ye inside?”Ye Sen said as he walked into the office.

“Millet stretched out her hand to stop ye Sen. “I’m sorry, no one else can enter President Ye’s office.” ”

“Ye Sen smiled and said, “I already said that I’m President Ye’s uncle.” ”

Uncle?
