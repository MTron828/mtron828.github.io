“Milo:”...”at the beginning, when ye Zao’s mother was cooking, Milo didn’t take it to heart at all. Who would have thought that ye Zao’s mother was actually the owner of the Ye family’s private kitchen! ”

Li Yueyue wasn’t too surprised.

Because she had already seen the ye Zao family’s heroic Spirit Soar to the sky last time.

How could an ordinary person live in Jinxiu Manor?

“After the three of them finished their hotpot, they went to buy milk tea and watched a movie. ”

Cen Shaoqing looked at the wechat picture sent by ye Zao and twirled the Buddha beads in his hand.

He felt a little depressed.

“At this moment, Cen Shaoqing received a voice message from he ziteng. ”

Cen Shaoqing opened it.

“”Fifth brother, there’s a barbecue event at my house tomorrow. Do you want to bring fifth sister-in-law along?” ”

“If it was in the past, he ziteng would definitely not send a message to CEN Shaoqing. Cen Shaoqing also never attended such gatherings. ”

Cen Shaoqing spent most of his free time in temples or reading Buddhist scriptures.

But now it was different.

“Ten-thousand-year-old monk Cen Shaoqing suddenly became sexually active, and Ye Zhuo was so much younger than him. He had to learn to adapt to the lifestyle of the modern young people. ”

“Cen Shaoqing did not immediately reply to he ziteng’s words. Instead, he opened ye Zhuo’s wechat and sent her a message, [ do you have class tomorrow? ] ”

“Ye Zhuo quickly replied, [ no class tomorrow. ] ”

“Cen Shaoqing immediately replied, [ Tomorrow Ziteng invited his friends to his house for a barbecue and invited us. Do you want to go? ] ”

[ sure! ]

“Then I’ll pick you up at Your School Tomorrow Morning.”

“Okay.”

“After communicating with Ye Zhuo, Cen Shaoqing went to reply to he ziteng. ”

“When he ziteng received Cen Shaoqing’s message, he was not surprised at all. After all, Cen Shaoqing had a family now. ”

“When he sent the message to CEN Shaoqing, he knew that Cen Shaoqing would definitely bring ye Zhuo over. ”

On the other side.

Beijing University dormitory.

“It was snowing heavily outside, and it was as warm as spring in the dormitory. Ye Zao sat in front of the computer desk and fought with all her might. Her fingers kept typing on the keyboard, and a design was displayed on the computer screen. ”

“In a moment, she clicked to save the picture. Then, she opened the chat tool and sent the saved picture to a person named [ nine miles ] . ”

The person immediately clicked accept.

“[ received, thank you, God Chen! ] ”

[ transfer the money to charity organizations. Send me a screenshot of the transaction. ]

Chu Jiuli was the director of a world-famous luxury brand.

He had been in contact with Gui Chen for more than half a year.

“Gui Chen was very talented in design. Every single item he designed was a classic among classics. No one could surpass it. Once it was released, no matter how high the price was, it would be snapped up and sold out. ”

There was only one desire for people to see it.

And that was:

Buy!

“Furthermore, Gui Chen had another characteristic. ”

He never asked for design fees. Every design fee would be transferred to charity organizations. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

They worked together five times in total.

“The design fees for these five times were either donated to poor mountain villages or charity organizations. Sometimes, they were even transferred to relief centers for stray dogs and cats. ”

Chu Jiuli did not expect that Gui Chen would still not receive any design fees for the third collaboration. This made him very curious about Gui Chen.

He did not know who this person was.

“As Chu Jiuli thought, he sent a message to the finance department, asking them to transfer the money to charity organizations. After the transfer was completed, he sent a screenshot of the transaction to Gui Chen. ”

“After receiving the picture that Chu Jiuli sent, ye Zao turned off his computer and prepared to wash up. ”

“The next morning, just as ye Zao changed his clothes, there was a knock on the dormitory door. ”

“Li Yueyue skipped over to open the door. Then, she turned around and shouted into the room, “Zao Zao! Someone is looking for you downstairs!” ”

“Got it.”Ye Zao put on his Martin Boots.

“Li Yueyue closed the door and walked to ye Zao’s side. She asked with a gossipy expression, “Zao Zao, who is the person waiting for you downstairs?” ”

“Ye Zao Bent Down and tied the shoelaces of his Martin Boots. “It should be my boyfriend.”After all, she had made an appointment with Cen Shaoqing to meet him in the afternoon. ”

Boyfriend! ?

Li Yueyue widened her eyes in surprise. “D * MN! I can finally meet your boyfriend today!”

One had to know that Li Yueyue had been curious about ye Zao’s boyfriend for a long time.

She couldn’t even think of what kind of person was worthy of ye Zao.

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “I don’t know if it’s my boyfriend either. Do you want to go down with me and take a look?” ”

“Whose boyfriend? whose boyfriend?”Milo came over with a curious look.
