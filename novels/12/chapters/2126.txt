“CEN yuying said, “That’s good too.”After all, Zhou Xiang was the biggest victim in this matter. She had the right to make a choice more than anyone else. ”

“Before long, Old Mrs. Cen sent Doctor Qiu back from outside. “What did you siblings discuss?” ”

“”Grandma,”cen yuying continued, “No matter what choice my mother makes, the four of us will support her.” ”

Old Mrs. Cen glanced at them and didn’t say anything.

...

On the other side.

The DUANMU family was in a mess.

Especially Duanmu Feng and the others.

“Seeing that the great elder and the others were about to bring back the young master of Dongli and that she was going to marry into the general alliance mansion, Cen Haifeng suddenly remembered everything at this critical moment. ”

“Since the founding of the General Alliance, such a ridiculous thing had never happened! ”

“”Mom, what should we do? has there been any letter from my aunt?”Duanmu feng frowned and paced back and forth. ”

“Not yet.”Mrs. Duanmu was also very anxious.

“”Where’s My Dad? Why didn’t he come back to see him when such a big thing happened?”Duanmu Feng continued, “Mom, have you informed my dad?” ”

Mrs. Duanmu nodded. “He has some urgent matters and can’t come back for the time being.”

“Duanmu Liangchen’s son had suddenly contracted an urgent illness and was in a life-and-death situation, so Duanmu Liangchen wouldn’t be able to return for the time being. ”

“If it were in the past, Mrs. Duanmu would definitely cause a ruckus. ”

“”What urgent matter could be more urgent than this?”Duanmu fengyu frowned. “Soon, aunt will be kicked out of the house!” ”

“Mrs. Duanmu continued, “Fengyu, don’t be anxious. Your aunt is so smart, so she will definitely be fine! “Besides, she has been with Cen Haifeng for so many years. I believe that Cen Haifeng will not really chase her out!” ”

“At this moment, the Butler walked in from the door. “Madam.” ”

“Mrs. Duanmu asked directly, “How is the headquarters?” ”

“The Butler looked around and said in a low voice, “Good news! Madam...” ”

“When she heard the housekeeper say that Cen Haifeng had fainted, Mrs. Duanmu said excitedly, “Really?” ”

“Yes.”The housekeeper nodded. “It was madam president who personally sent someone over to say it!”

“”That’s good, that’s Good!”Mrs. Duanmu patted her chest. ”

“Duanmu fengyu continued, “Mom, why don’t we go to the Central Hospital?” ”

“Otherwise, she would feel a little worried. ” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Duanmu Huangfei was a person who never reported bad news.

“Okay.”Mrs. Duanmu nodded. “Let’s go and visit your uncle.”

“After making some preparations, the mother and daughter arrived at the Central Hospital. ”

“Cen Haifeng stayed in the top VIP ward, so he had to make an appointment in advance. ”

“After receiving a call from the front desk, Duanmu Huangfei immediately went downstairs. ”

“Auntie.”

Duanmu Fengfei walked up to Duanmu Fengfei.

“Duanmu fengfei continued, “It’s so late. Why are you two still here?” ”

“When Mrs. Duanmu raised her head and saw a palm print on Duanmu Fengfei’s face, she was shocked. “Sister, what happened to you?” ”

“Nothing.”Duanmu fengfei shook her head.

“He...”Mrs. Duanmu looked inside the ward. “Did he attack you?”

“Seeing her family, Duanmu Fengfei finally couldn’t hold back her tears and nodded. ”

Even Duanmu Fengfei herself didn’t expect Cen Haifeng to attack her.

“After all, she and Cen Haifeng were husband and wife for twenty years. ”

What was the relationship between them for these twenty years?

“Mrs. Duanmu grabbed Duanmu Fengfei’s hand and said with a frown, “I knew you wouldn’t report the bad news, but I didn’t expect him to attack you! How could he do this? You’ve given so much for him...”. ”

“It’s nothing.”Duanmu fengfei took a deep breath. “Isn’t it just a Slap?”

“A slap was nothing, but what was worse was to come. ”

She was so close...

She was so close to being kicked out by Cen Haifeng!

“Mrs. Duanmu’s eyes were full of heartache. Duanmu Fengfei had always been a competitive person. Cen Haifeng had really gone too far this time. If others saw this, how would Duanmu Fengfei Behave? ”

“Where’s Liangchen?”Duanmu Fengyu asked.

“”My dad didn’t come back,”Duanmu Fengyu answered. ”

Didn’t come back?

“Hearing this answer, Duanmu Fengyu’s eyes flashed with displeasure. With her understanding of Duanmu Liangchen, she knew what he was up to! ”

“How long has it been since he came back?”Duanmu Fengyu asked

“My father hasn’t come back for more than a month!”Duanmu Fengyu said.
