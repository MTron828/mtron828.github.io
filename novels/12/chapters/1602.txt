“Tang Xue laughed out loud. “Not to mention not being able to complete it according to the agreement, even if ye Zhuo was given another 30 years, she wouldn’t be able to complete it! Using a nuclear reactor as raw material, who does she think she is?” ”

A nuclear reactor could be used as power raw material?

“When Tang Xue heard this comment back then, she thought it was funny and laughable. As expected, there was a problem with the power raw material now. ”

“Where is Tang Mi Now?”Tang Xue continued to ask.

“”I just saw her enter the laboratory with Miss Ye,”the assistant replied. ”

“What an idiot!”Tang Xue’s tone was a little disappointed. “What time is it? She’s still dreaming of making a name for herself!”

“As one of the leaders of the aircraft carrier project team, if the aircraft carrier project was successfully completed, Tang Mi’s name would be carved on the milestone of history along with all the members. ”

Praise from generation to generation.

Unfortunately.

Tang mi miscalculated and walked on a path of no return.

“When the betting agreement came into effect, Tang Mi would just wait to Cry! ”

“Soon, it was time to get off work. ”

The employees in the base left one after another. Only the lab staff of Big C remained at their posts.

“After Tang Xue left the base, she did not go straight home. Instead, she went to a coffee shop. ”

“When she arrived at the agreed-upon location, the other party was already waiting. ”

Tang Xue smiled as she walked over. “Mr. William.”

“Miss Tang.”William raised his head slightly. “Please take a seat.”

Tang Xue leaned over and sat on the chair opposite William.

“William took a sip of coffee and continued, “How’s the Cen’s base recently?” ”

“”As you wish, there’s been another problem today,”Tang Xue said. ”

“What problem?”William asked.

“”The problem of the aircraft carrier’s power raw materials.”Tang Xue also took a sip of coffee, then she said, “Mr. William, actually there’s no need to worry about the headquarters at all. Not to mention that there’s less than two years before the three-year agreement, even if ye Zao was given another two years, she wouldn’t be able to build an aircraft carrier faster than the speed of light.” ”

“William stirred the coffee in his cup and smiled. “I’m relieved with Miss Tang’s words. Don’t worry, Miss Tang. I’ll definitely tell the Headquarters the truth about your contributions.” ”

“”Thank you.”Tang Xue raised her cup towards William. “I only hope that after the three-year agreement expires, the headquarters will not forget a person like me. Mr. William, don’t forget your promise.” ”

“”Don’t worry, we C Nation people always keep our promises.”William raised his cup. “When the gambling agreement expires, Miss Tang will definitely be the base’s Chinese agent.” ”

“Soon, the Cen’s base would become the base of C Nation and a few other countries, so Tang Xue naturally had to find a way out at this time. ”

“Therefore, she thought of a way to get on William’s good side and signed a contract with him. During these three years, she provided William with all kinds of information, and William promised her the identity of the base’s Chinese agent. ”

“After country C and a few other countries took away the ownership and management rights of the CEN base, she would be the new owner of the CEN base in China! ”

“At that time, whether it was ye Zhuo or Cen Shaoqing, they would all have to look at her! ”

“The more Tang Xue thought about it, the more pleased she became. ”

“William looked at his watch and continued, “Miss Tang, I still have something to do. Let’s make an appointment on wechat the next time we meet.” ”

“Okay.”

“After leaving the cafe, Tang Xue drove home. ”

“When the car stopped at the entrance of the villa, she saw Tang standing at the door talking to someone. ”

“When she got closer, she realized that this person was Tang Mi’s mother, Xiao Qing. ”

Tang Xue smiled and walked over. “Auntie.”

“Xiao Qing saw Tang Xue and said with a smile, “Xiaoxue, you’re back! Did Our Tang Mi come back with you?” ”

“”There’s a problem in area C. Tang Mi should still be busy,”Tang Xue said. ”

“Area C? Isn’t Tang Mi in Area B? When did she go to Area C?”Xiao Qing asked in puzzlement.

“Tang Xue said, “Little aunt, don’t you know? In order to pursue her dream, Tang Mi made a name for herself. As early as last year, she joined Miss Ye’s aircraft carrier project team!” ”

“What?”Xiao Qing’s expression changed.

“Of course, she knew about the aircraft carrier incident. But what she didn’t know was that Tang Mi also joined! ”

“”Xiaoxue, are you not joking with me?” ”

“Tang hurriedly said, “Xiaoxue, it’s not good to joke with your auntie about such things!” ”

“”Mom, Auntie, do you think I would joke about such things?”Tang Xue continued, “Auntie, if you don’t believe me, you can ask Tang Mi when she comes back later.” ”

“Tang frowned. “Xiaoxue, you’re Tang Mi’s sister. Why Don’t you try to persuade your sister? Your bones are broken and your tendons are still attached!” ”

Tang Xue sneered with a sarcastic look in her eyes. “Persuade? Can I persuade her?”

“Xiao Qing said, “Xiaoxue, have you tried to persuade Tang Mi?” ”

“”Auntie, I’m her sister. Can I just watch her jump into the fire pit?”Tang Xue turned to look at Xiao Qing and continued, “But not only did she not listen to me, she even thought that I was harming her. What can I Do?” ”𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com
