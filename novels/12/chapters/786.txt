Translator: 549690339

Cen Yueya was a little confused. “Didn’t you make Grandma Angry?”

“”With Grandma’s combat strength, do you think I can anger her?”Cen Yuyan asked back. ”

She hadn’t said a word.

Old Mrs. Cen directly retorted more than ten times.

She was the one who was angry.

“After saying that, CEN Yuyan continued, “I only said Chenyu in front of Grandma. I don’t understand what exactly is wrong with Chenyu to make grandma hate him so much.” ”

“Cen Yueya did not explain to song Chenyu, but she had heard Old Lady Cen mention song Chenyu before. In addition, she had met song Chenyu once during the new year, so her impression of Song Chenyu was not very good. ”

“Hearing this, Cen Yueya’s expression changed. “Fourth girl, I’m telling you, don’t think about things you shouldn’t think about. Don’t get too close to Song Chenyu either. In terms of scheming, you can’t beat Song Chenyu.” ”

“In front of Song Chenyu, Cen Yuyan was nothing? ”

Cen Yuyan’s scheming was not even half as good as song Chenyu’s.

“”Second sister, why are you also saying this about Chenyu?”Cen Yuyan frowned. ”

“CEN Yueya continued, “It’s not that I’m saying this, but Song Chenyu is not a simple person. Look at the way she looks at Shaoqing on the first day of the New Year at the club. is that the way a normal woman looks at a man?” ”

Cen Yuyan pursed her lips. “That means Shaoqing is outstanding! which girl doesn’t have a secret crush?”

“CEN Yueya said, “But you have to know that Shaoqing has a girlfriend!” ”

Cen Yuyan did not say anything.

So what if Cen Shaoqing has a girlfriend?

It was clearly ye Zhuo who snatched Cen Shaoqing away from Song Chenyu.

“After all, Song Chenyu and Cen Shaoqing met first. ”

“When song Chenyu knew Cen Shaoqing, Ye Zhuo was still in a corner of cloud capital. ”

“Speaking of immoral, it was also ye Zhuo who was immoral. ”

What did it have to do with song Chenyu.

“But now, Cen Yueya was the same as Old Lady Cen. She had been brainwashed by Ye Zhuo. No matter how much she said, they would not listen to her. ”

“CEN Yuyan continued, “Second sister, I know what you mean. I was just casually saying it, and you really took it seriously? Shaoqing is so good-looking. which young lady would not be at a loss when she sees him?” ”

“Cen Yueya glanced at Cen Yuyan, she continued, “Yuyan, I know that you and song Chenyu are very close, but you have to be careful in front of her. Don’t tell her everything without thinking! “Also, Zhuozhuo is my biological younger sister-in-law. Tell song Chenyu not to have any wicked thoughts, and you too! “Don’t always be an outsider. It’s your fortune to have a younger sister-in-law like Zhuozhuo in your past life! “Don’t be ignorant of your good fortune! “If you dare to scheme against burning, don’t blame me for falling out with you!” ”

“Under normal circumstances, CEN Yueya would call Cen Yuyan the fourth servant girl. However, when she said this, she called Cen Yuyan by her name. ”

“This was because from the bottom of her heart, she had already regarded ye Zhuo as a member of this family. ”

It was not easy for CEN Shaoqing to get to where he was today.

“As Cen Shaoqing’s second sister, Cen Yueya had once thought that this younger brother’s ending would always be accompanied by an ancient Buddha. ”

Ye Zao was the light in his life.

It was his salvation.

Ye Zao’s appearance changed Cen Shaoqing’s fate and also the fate of the entire Cen family.

“Hearing this, Cen Yuyan wanted to laugh. ”

“It was clearly Cen Yueya and the others who were in the middle of the situation and couldn’t see the truth clearly, yet they still came to cover her eyes. ”

Did they really think that she was as stupid as them?

“Cen Yuyan said, “Alright, I understand.” ”

“Cen Yueya patted Cen Yuyan’s shoulder, “If it wasn’t for burning, there wouldn’t be the current Shaoqing. “Yuyan, I hope that you can understand this logic. At the same time, burning is Shaoqing’s last line. If you were to do something stupid in a moment of confusion, do you think that Shaoqing will let you off?” ”

Cen Yueya’s words were good advice and a warning.

“But in Cen Yuyan’s ears, it became a joke. ”

Cen Shaoqing would not let her go?

Cen Shaoqing did not really love ye burning.

He was just acting for Old Lady Cen to see.

“Could it be that Cen Shaoqing would turn against her, his fourth sister, for a woman? ”

What a joke!

She saw that Cen Yueya was usually not muddle-headed and was also a well-known designer. Why had she become so muddle-headed at this time?

Could it be that she had inherited the Cen Old Lady’s genes?

It must be.

“Fortunately, she was not like Old Lady Cen. ”

“If she was like Old Lady Cen, then the entire Cen family would be finished. ”

“As far as the eye could see, in the entire Cen family, she was the only one who understood. ”
