Zhang Qingqing narrowed her eyes.

Didn’t Lin Ze have two other friends?

Fat Tiger and Li Wen.

“Li Wen didn’t dare to say that Fat Tiger was definitely a nouveau riche. After all, the Green Water Ghost Watch on Fat Tiger’s hand was worth seven digits. Seven digits was enough to buy a house in a county-level city, which ordinary family would wear a house on their hand?”

“Although fat tiger looked a little silly, in this era, money was the father!”

“Thinking of this, Zhang Qingqing had an idea.”

“While watching the movie today, she heard from the side that Fat Tiger was going to go to the game city with a few classmates tomorrow.”

On the other side.

“Lin Ze replied to Buttface, [ I don’t know what type of boy sister Lizi likes. Moreover, I feel that there are no standards for liking this kind of thing. Even if there is a set of standards, if you meet someone you really like, you might find that what you like is far from your standards. If you really like someone, then go and fight for it yourself. Don’t deliberately change yourself just to like someone. ]”

This was probably the most number of words Lin Ze had replied to buttface on wechat.

“Buttface even thought that he was hallucinating,”

when did Lin Ze become so diligent? 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Moreover, what Lin Ze said made sense.”

There was no standard for liking.

“Before he saw an Lizi, he didn’t know that he liked this kind of girl.”

It was a very strange feeling.

“At a glance, his heart pounded.”

“In the past, he always thought that love at first sight in romance novels was too exaggerated. Now, he realized that he thought it was exaggerated because he had never experienced it firsthand.”

“As long as he had experienced it personally, he wouldn’t think it was exaggerated.”

“[ brother Ze, did you secretly fall in love with someone behind our backs? ] Lin Ze said it logically. How could someone who had never fallen in love before be like this?”

[ no. ] Lin Ze returned to his previous state.

[ couldn’t have said it so well? ] Buttface didn’t believe it.

[ talent. ]

Buttface: [ stop bragging! ]

Lin Ze simply didn’t reply.

The next day.

Zhang Qingqing arrived at the game city that Fat Tiger had mentioned an hour earlier.

“The game city was very big. As it was a Sunday, it was almost full of people.”

“Zhang Qingqing exchanged for game coins. As she walked, she looked for Fat Tiger’s back.”

“At this moment, she saw a familiar figure in the crowd.”

It was fat tiger.

Zhang Qingqing hurriedly trotted over. “Fat Tiger!”

“When Fat Tiger saw Zhang Qingqing, he was stunned for a moment before he reacted. “You... You Are... Zhang... Zhang...”fat tiger couldn’t remember the last two words.”

“Seeing that fat tiger couldn’t even remember her name, Zhang Qingqing couldn’t help but feel a little angry.”

Could it be that she had such a common face?

If only dog two was fat tiger!

“The person she should have liked didn’t like her, but the person she shouldn’t have liked stuck to her.”

“Zhang Qingqing smiled and said, “Zhang Qingqing!””

“”Right, right, right! Zhang Qingqing!”Only then did fat tiger remember, “You’re sister Lizi’s good friend!””

Sister Lizi?

She remembered that an Lizi didn’t even remember her!

This was a little too much!

“Zhang Qingqing suppressed the emotions in her eyes and continued, “I really didn’t expect to see you here! Oh right, why didn’t dog two and Li Wen follow us? Lin Ze went to accompany his girlfriend. Could it be that they have a girlfriend too?””

“When he heard this, fat tiger said in surprise, “Brother Ze has a girlfriend? Who said that? Why Don’t I know? Who is brother Ze’s girlfriend?””

“You don’t know that Lin Ze has a girlfriend?”Zhang Qingqing asked.

“Fat Tiger shook his head. “I don’t know! That’s impossible! You must have made a mistake! With my relationship with brother Ze, if he had a girlfriend, he would definitely tell me immediately!””

“Zhang Qingqing smiled and said, “Maybe I made a mistake!””

“At this point, how could Zhang Qingqing not understand what was going on?”

It was clear that an Lizi and buttface had joined forces to lie to her!

Too Much!

This was too much!

“She treated an Lizi as her best friend, but what about an Lizi?”

An Lizi actually lied to her!

“In an Lizi’s heart, what was she?”

She couldn’t care less about people saying that people could change.

“An Lizi, who had become a rich young lady, was indeed different from before.”

“Thinking back to more than ten years ago, her relationship with an Lizi was so good.”

And Now?

Things have changed!

An Lizi was no longer the an lizi she knew.

“An Lizi definitely did not want her to marry Lin Ze, and did not want her to become a rich lady!”
