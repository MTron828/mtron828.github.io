“Xi Weiyue walked over and asked gently, “Little Wang, have you been busy in the shop recently?””

“Little Wang replied, “Not very busy, it’s still the same.””

“Xi Weiyue nodded and asked casually, “Who’s the guest in the private room? I think Auntie seems to take it very seriously.””

“Little Wang glanced in the direction of the private room. “I’m not too sure either, but I know that the guest is a VIP customer. Every time he comes, Auntie Lang personally receives him.””

“”Oh, I see.”XI weiyue continued, “Are there two of them?””

Xiao Wang nodded. “I think so.”

“OH.”Xi Weiyue did not continue this topic.

“At this moment, Aunt Lang walked out of the private room.”

“Xi Weiyue followed Aunt Lang to the kitchen. “Aunt, is there anything I can help you with?””

Aunty Lang shook her head. “There’s nothing I need your help with.”

Xi Weiyue’s expression did not change as she continued to follow Aunty Lang into the kitchen.

The kitchen was very big.

There were two chefs busy inside. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Although the daily visitor flow was not very big for half a month, the guest unit price was very high. The guest unit price determined the quality of the dishes. In order to ensure the taste of the dishes, the two chefs were very busy every day.”

Aunt Lang turned to look at Xi Weiyue. “The kitchen is very smoky. Why Don’t you go out First?”

“XI weiyue smiled and said, “It’s okay, aunt, how can I be so delicate? I can’t even stay in the kitchen anymore?””

Aunt Lang did not say anything more and lifted the lid of the pot for the dessert.

This was rose taro round dew.

Xi Weiyue narrowed her eyes.

Could it be that the guests in the private room were a man and a woman?

“If it was two men, they would definitely not order dessert.”

Aunt Lang stirred the rose taro dew with her spoon.

The Taro Dew was very difficult to cook. It would take at least five minutes before it was out of the pot.

“Since ye Langhua did not let her in, she could think of a way to get in herself.”

“Xi Weiyue narrowed her eyes and smiled. “Aunt, the kitchen is really stuffy. I’m going out for a walk.””

“Go ahead.”Aunty Lang nodded.

Xi Weiyue turned around and walked out the door.

“Just as she walked out of Aunty Lang’s line of sight, she quickened her pace.”

“Xi Weiyue walked all the way to the courtyard. Just as she was about to go to the private room to take a look, the bead curtain in the private room was suddenly lifted by a slender hand.”

“Between her fingers was a string of bright red Buddha beads. The Red Buddha beads contrasted with her fair skin, making it appear well-defined.”

This was a hand that was so beautiful that it made one feel suffocated.

Xi Weiyue was stunned for a moment.

“The next second, the bead curtain was pulled open.”

The person who appeared in front of Xi Weiyue was an extraordinarily handsome man.

“He was about 1.9 meters tall and wore a retro-styled plain robe. There was no expression on his exquisitely carved face. His thin lips were tightly pursed, and his every move carried a cold air of abstinence.”

The Red Mole at the corner of her eye only added a bit of dignity.

It made people shudder.

Who Was This?

Xi Weiyue did not recognize him.

But she could feel that this man was definitely not simple.

Just this powerful aura alone was not something that ordinary people could have.

“Xi Weiyue smiled and mustered up her courage to walk forward. “Excuse me, sir, do you need help?””

“No.”

The word “Very cold”caused the air pressure to drop by several degrees.

He did not even look at Xi Weiyue as he walked past her.

“Xi Weiyue stood rooted to the ground, not daring to say another word. Her breathing was labored.”

The man walked to the flower pot under the eaves and reached out to pull a few peppermint leaves. He turned on the tap and washed them seriously.

“After confirming that the peppermint leaves were clean, the man turned around and walked into the house.”

It was not until the man’s back disappeared into the beaded curtain of the private room that Xi Weiyue finally reacted and took in deep breaths of air.

Who exactly was this man?

Xi Weiyue had been by Xi Muwen’s side all these years. She could be considered knowledgeable and knew many big shots in the capital city.

But this one.

This was her first time meeting him.

Was he related to the Shunxi Financial Group?

“For a moment, Xi Weiyue was very confused.”

In the private room.

Cen Shaoqing handed the mint leaves that had been washed to ye Zhuo.

“”So Fast?”Ye Zhuo took the mint leaves and put them in the smoothie to stir. As he stirred, the refreshing scent of his own mint immediately emanated from the smoothie.”

Ye Zhuo liked peppermint very much.

“However, Aunt Lang’s desserts almost never contained peppermint, so she asked Cen Shaoqing to pick some from the yard.”

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “After dinner, shall we go to the movies?””

“MMM.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

Xi Weiyue wanted to wait for them to come out after dinner and take a look at the other person’s appearance at the same time.
