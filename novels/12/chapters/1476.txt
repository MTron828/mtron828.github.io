“Hearing this, Miss Smith quickly smiled and said, “If that’s the case, then I’ll have to trouble you, Miss Ye!” ”

“Where’s the main computer?”Ye Zao looked at Smith.

“Smith made a ‘please’gesture. “Miss Ye, please follow me this way.” ”

Ye Zao followed Smith’s footsteps.

Everyone came to the main computer.

“Ye Zao leaned over and sat down. On the pitch-black computer screen, there was only a bright red “L”. Ye Zao was about to raise his hand when Bai Xiaosu said, “Miss Ye, Wait.” ”

Ye Zao stopped.

“Bai Xiaosu looked at Smith, then he said, “Miss Smith, you have to look carefully. Before our miss ye made her move, there was nothing on the computer. Don’t make the same mistake again and push the credit of our miss ye onto Polly! “Mr. Polly, if you can defeat L, then come out now!” ”

Polly didn’t say anything.

He felt that Bai Xiaosu was humiliating him!

“He knew that he couldn’t do it, but he still said it on purpose. ”

“But soon, Polly was relieved. ”

Because Bai Xiaosu wouldn’t be able to laugh for long! Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Ye Zao could defeat L?

In his dreams!

“By then, ye Zao would only be in a worse state than he was now. ”

“Smith hurriedly said, “Don’t worry, team leader Bai, that’s definitely not the case!” ”

“”Miss Smith, remember what you said.” ”

The deputy executive officer walked down from upstairs and saw ye Zao sitting on the main computer. He immediately heaved a sigh of relief. There was hope! There was hope!

Their Selead branch was saved!

“Afraid that his eyes were playing tricks on him, the deputy executive officer wiped his eyes with all his might. After confirming that his eyes were not playing tricks on him, he quickly ran to ye Zao’s side, “That’s great! Miss Ye, you’re finally back! I’ve already said that you have to do it yourself! Miss Ye, do you want some water? I’ll get you some!” ”

“”Thank you, I’m not thirsty.”Ye Zao raised his eyes slightly. ”

“After saying that, ye Zao started to move. His ten fingers quickly jumped on the keyboard. The speed was so fast that only afterimages could be seen. ”

“Before long, the computer that was originally a black screen suddenly changed to a page full of code. ”

“The computer reflected a fluorescent light on her serious face, appearing cold and aloof. ”

Everyone looked at her like this. They couldn’t even bear to blink their eyes.

On the other side.

“L, who was sitting in front of the computer and smoking, suddenly put out the cigarette in his hand. He sat up straight, pressed the mouse with one hand, and pressed the keyboard with the other. He quickly counterattacked. ”

“Although l couldn’t see the scene on the other side of the computer, the constantly changing progress bar told him that there was a new person on the other side. ”

“If he guessed correctly, this person was the one who hacked his firewall and restored the surveillance. ”

He’s Here!

He’s finally here!

“When he encountered a real opponent, L didn’t dare to relax. He put in 120% of his energy and went all out. ”

However...

It was obvious that he had underestimated the opponent.

“In less than ten minutes, the source of the virus that he created was mostly eliminated by the opponent. ”

“Moreover, the opponent could come back at any time. ”

How could this be?

“Looking at the constantly changing code on the computer, L’s eyes were filled with disbelief. ”

Over here.

Polly had been standing behind ye Zao the whole time.

“Even now, he could not tell if ye Zao knew anything about computers. ”

“With such third-rate technology, he still wanted to defeat L? ”

Dream on.

Polly’s eyes were filled with ridicule.

“Five minutes later, Adar pulled Polly to the side and asked curiously, “How is it?” ”

Polly shook his head. “Nothing much! I suspect that Chinese person doesn’t know anything about computers at all. I really can’t see what she’s trying to do!”

“Polly was a top computer expert. Other than L. , there were very few people who were his match. Even Polly could not see what ye Zao was doing. From this, it could be seen that ye Zao really did not have much ability. ”

“Hearing this, Adar heaved a sigh of relief. ”

“Adar did not know anything about computers. Seeing that ye Zao was so fast, he thought that ye Zao really had some amazing hacking skills. ”

Now it seemed that it was just some tricks to fool people.

On L.’s side.

“Although only twenty minutes had passed, only L. knew how difficult these twenty minutes had been for him. ”

“In the beginning, the other party was just cleaning up the virus. ”

“But now, the other party had actually launched an attack on him. ”

“As the code kept changing, the incredulous look in L.’s eyes became more and more intense. ”

“As the number one hacker in the world, he had never known that someone’s hacking skills had reached such a level of perfection. ”

Terrifying.

It was too terrifying!
