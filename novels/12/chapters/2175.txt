“I have to say, Ye Zao used this move really well! ”

It was a pity.

A man’s plan was not as good as God’s.

Ye Zao still underestimated Zhao Dan and Man Jiangshan.

Ye Zao was destined to be a chess piece in the hands of Zhao Dan and Man Jiangshan. She could not break free no matter what.

“It would be fine if she quietly acknowledged Zhao Dan and Man Jiangshan. After going around in such a roundabout way, man Jiangshan and his wife would definitely squeeze the last bit of value out of ye Zao. ”

“As for restoring the truth, it was just ye Zao bluffing. ”

How could she restore the truth?

Did Ye Zao think that Zhao Dan and the man Jiangshan couple could be so easily scared?

Naive!

“The trial staff immediately walked up to the stage. After examining it, they faced everyone, they announced, “After testing, there is no problem with the equipment. If the plaintiff has any objections, you can re-examine it, or the plaintiff can go on stage to examine it.” ”

“Someone in the audience stood up. “Mr. Judge, my daughter and I are mother and daughter. May we go on stage to test it?” ”

“If there was really something wrong with the machine, then checking anyone would show that there was no parent-child relationship. ”

“”No problem,”the judge said. ”

The mother and daughter in the audience stood up and walked onto the stage.

The two pressed their palms onto the instrument.

“At this moment, everyone held their breath and listened to the sound of the instrument. ”

“Three, two, one! ”

“”After verification, Wu Ting and Zhou Ziye’s parent-child relationship has been established.” ”

Established.

“In other words, there was nothing wrong with the instrument. ”

“Could it be that the lady really mistook the wrong person?”

“I’m dumbfounded!”

“Could it be that she slapped herself in the end?”

[ what’s going on? ]

[ I’m a little confused! ]

“Another person in the audience stood up and said, “Mr. Judge, we request to re-examine the instrument.” ”

Another pair of father and son-like people walked onto the stage and began to examine the instrument.

“Soon, a mechanical voice was heard. ”

“”After examination, Wu Zihao and Wu Zhicheng’s parent-child relationship is not established.” ”

Not established!

“This time, it was actually not valid. ”

“However, Wu Zihao and Wu Zhicheng were clearly biological father and son. ”

“Therefore, this machine must have been set by someone. Odd numbers were not valid, even numbers were valid! ”

“Ye Zhuo and Zhao Dan were the first to walk onto the stage to verify, so it was not valid. ”

“However, in reality, Ye Zhuo was Zhao Dan’s biological daughter. ”

She was the full moon.

“This time, Zhao Dan finally heaved a sigh of relief and turned to look at Ye Zhuo, “Yue’er, I’ve fulfilled my wish to see you today. If you don’t like me calling you Yue’er, I’ll be like them in the future and call you Miss Ye.” ”

“Man Xing stood up at the right time, “Elder sister, we’re originally a family. We shouldn’t have caused such a ruckus. “I know that the problem with the equipment has nothing to do with you. Father said that all the children in our family are naturally kind-hearted and would never do such a thing. All of this is just a misunderstanding.” ”

“The mother and daughter spoke one word at a time. It seemed like they were trying to justify ye Zhuo, but in reality, every word was evidence of ye Zhuo’s infidelity. ”

“As the former female monarch of Changyue and the future First Lady of the alliance, she was supposed to be a role model for the people of the s galaxy. However, she was a negative example for everyone. ”

“If ye Zhuo did not acknowledge his parents and sister today, he would not have the right to establish a foothold in the s galaxy. ”

“For a moment, everyone’s anger was burning to the extreme. ”

The audience watching the live broadcast were also extremely angry.

“It’s already like this. Does Ye Zhuo still not want to acknowledge his parents?”

“”I’m really angry!”! From Ye Zhuo’s point of view, she had indeed suffered a lot when she was young. However, Mr. and Mrs. Man did not intentionally lose her! For so many years, the Manxing Kingdom had never stopped searching for the full moon. Now that they had finally found it, this was indeed the result! I really feel bad for Mr. and Mrs. Man ”

“To be honest, although the Manxing princess was not as good-looking as ye Zao, she was kinder and more filial than ye Zao. Ye Zao was not qualified to be her sister at all ”

“”If ye Zao doesn’t admit his mistake today, then get the hell out of S Galaxy!” ”

“”Mr. Man, Mrs. Man, the full star Princess. You may have misunderstood.”At this moment, wu Zihao turned to the crowd and continued, “Zhicheng is the child I adopted many years ago. He is indeed not my biological child, so there is no problem with the device.” ”

What?

The audience exploded when they heard that.

Wu Zihao and Wu Zhicheng were actually not biological father and son.

“Wu zihao continued, “If you don’t believe this, you can go to the deyou welfare institute to check the relevant information. “The reason why I hid this matter just now was to test whether the device was tampered with.” ”
