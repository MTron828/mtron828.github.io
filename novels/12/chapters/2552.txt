Translator: 549690339

They had thought that Weiwei would never forgive them again. Who would have thought that she would forgive them so quickly.

What a ‘silly child’

How did this IQ become a famous manga author?

Was the bar for manga authors so low now?

On the other side.

At the nurses’station.

“”Little song, did you know? Weiwei’s relationship with her parents seems to have eased up!” ”

Nurse song nodded. “That seems to be the case.”

“After saying that, nurse song sighed and continued, “Children are children. If I Were Weiwei, I would never forgive them! I think they’re here for Weiwei’s money. They’re really too shameless!” ”

“”That’s right, that’s right!” ”

“”Actually, doctor Wang contributed half of this.”Speaking up to this point, nurse song turned around and looked around. Just in case Wang Dajun was hiding in some corner again, there was no one around, only then did nurse song muster up her courage and said, “If it wasn’t for doctor Wang, how would those disgusting parents know about Weiwei’s current situation?” ”

“”You can’t say that.”A beautiful nurse with an exquisite figure walked over from the side, “Doctor Wang is also doing this for Weiwei’s good. Doctors treat their parents. If doctor Wang didn’t want Weiwei to recover quickly, he wouldn’t have gone through so much trouble to find Weiwei’s parents!” ”

“”It’s Fangfang.”Nurse song smiled and turned around. “Fangfang, are you so sure that doctor Wang is confident that he can cure Weiwei?” ”

Jin Fang was the most beautiful nurse in the entire nurses’station. She was a fresh graduate and was very popular in the hospital. She was even pursued by many doctors.

“Jin Fang said, “I don’t care who you believe. I believe in Doctor Wang anyway.” ”

She also agreed with Wang Dajun’s words.

“The current Wang Dajun was the ye Zhuo from back then. No one agreed with her, but in the end, she still made a gamble and succeeded. ”

“Now that she was on Wang Dajun’s side, it proved her vision and structure. ”

“”It’s useless no matter what I say now,”jin fang continued, “We’ll just wait for the surgery tomorrow. After all...”at this point, Jin Fang paused and then added, “Facts speak louder than words.” ”

Nurse song nodded. “Then let’s wait for tomorrow. I also believe that facts speak louder than words.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Although the surgery was scheduled for tomorrow, a lot of media had gathered outside the hospital today. ”

“As soon as director Han came out, he was surrounded by many reporters. ”

“”Director Han, I want to ask, what do you think of Tomorrow’s surgery?” ”

“Do you believe in Doctor Wang or Miracle Doctor Ye?”

“...”

Director Han was a little confused by this series of questions.

“After a while, director Han continued, “First of all, this surgery is completely a decision between Wang Dajun and the patient. It has nothing to do with our hospital. Our Hospital has always agreed with Miss Ye’s diagnosis.” ”

“”The patient has been confirmed to have malaria. If we insist on the surgery, after all, there will be a decrease in heart rate and non-stop bleeding. Once this happens, the patient will face death...” ”

“Before director Han could finish his sentence, he was interrupted by the reporter. “May I ask how you came to this conclusion?” ”

“Director Han continued, “These results were all deduced by Miss Ye. As I said, our hospital absolutely believes in Miss Ye.” ”

“The reporter asked director Han some other questions, but director Han answered them the same way. No matter what, he believed in ye Zhuo. ”

“Wang Dajun stood at the side and looked at director Han’s answer. The corners of his mouth curled up slightly, but he didn’t go forward to interrupt director Han’s speech. ”

This was pretty good.

“After Tomorrow, director Han would discover just how stupid his actions were. ”

How confident director Han was now would be how regretful director Han would be tomorrow.

Ye Zhuo was also regretful.

Ye Zhuo was too confident.

“Because of curing cancer, she had become arrogant and would not listen to anyone’s opinions. ”

“But thinking about it, it made sense. Life always had to face a beating. ”

Ye Zhuo was still young. She would experience this kind of thing many times in the future. This was just the beginning.

“Soon, it was the second day. ”

“At six o’clock in the morning, Wang Dajun arrived at the hospital and began to prepare for the surgery. ”

Today’s surgery was broadcasted live. He must not make any mistakes.

He was bound to become famous in one battle!

“Weiwei was also very nervous. If the surgery was successful, she could live happily with her parents in the future. ”

“If it failed, her happiness would stop there. ”
