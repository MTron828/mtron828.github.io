What should I do now?

Song Chenyu bit her lips tightly and tried to calm herself down. She picked up her phone and called the Zhou parents.

“In order to let everyone see the Zhou parents’true colors, song Chenyu specially turned her phone to recording mode. ”

Weren’t the Zhou parents doing this to ask for money?

“If she gave them a call, the Zhou family’s parents would definitely reveal their true nature and ask for money from her. ”

“When that time came, she would upload the recording onto the Internet and the truth would be revealed. ”

Very soon.

The call was connected.

“”Hello, this is song Chenyu.” ”

“After song Chenyu received her call, the Zhou family’s parents would definitely ask for a lot of money. It was as if the Zhou family’s parents had become a different person. “Chenyu, you’re finally willing to call. Father and mother are doing very well now. You Don’t have to worry.” ”

The Zhou family’s parents could naturally think of the problems that song Chenyu could think of.

They had long guessed that song Chenyu would definitely record the conversation.

“Song Chenyu was stunned for a moment before she continued, “Don’t you all just want money? Tell me, how much do you want? I’ll transfer it to you!” ”

“Mother Zhou hurriedly explained, “Chenyu, you’ve misunderstood. We have no intention of asking you for money...” ” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Then what do you want to Do?”

“Mother Zhou said, “Your father and I couldn’t find you anywhere. We were worried that you would be cheated. When we called you, you blacklisted us again, so we could only find you through the media! “Now that we know that you’re fine, we’re much more relieved.” ”

“Song Chenyu almost roared in anger, “Stop acting!” ”

“”You child, we really care about you! How can you say that we are acting?” ”

Song Chenyu was so angry that he smashed his phone.

Bang!

The black phone was smashed to the ground and instantly shattered into pieces.

“On the other end of the screen, mother Zhou sneered, “Little B * Tch! With that little trick of hers, she still wants to fight with me!” ”

“Father Zhou said with some worry, “We have made things so awkward. What if she doesn’t pay when the time comes?” ”

“Mother Zhou said, “Doesn’t give us the money?”? “If she doesn’t give us the money, we’ll expose her to the media again!”! “I’d like to see if she still wants to continue working in the entertainment industry!”! “Besides, it’s only 80 million yuan. She’s a big star and not like US ordinary people. Big Stars get paid quickly. 80 million yuan is nothing to her!” ”

Father Zhou nodded. “That’s true.”

“Song Chenyu had just dropped her phone when the door was pushed open from outside. Her manager, brother Tao, walked in with a face full of anger. “Chenyu! What’s going on with your parents? Didn’t you say that you’re an orphan?” ”

“Song Chenyu grabbed brother Tao’s sleeve. “Brother Tao, you have to help me!” ”

Brother Tao’s expression did not look good.

“Previously, because of the incident that happened in Country 2, Song Chenyu had already lost a portion of her popularity. Now that there was such a scandal, it was really difficult to clear her name in such a short period of time! ”

“When he first appeared on the trending searches, brother Tao and the public relations department had taken down the trending searches for three hours. The first trending search had just been taken down, but the second trending search had already risen up. Not only did it not suppress the popularity, but it also increased the popularity of the trending searches, on the contrary, it increased the popularity of the trending searches. ”

It was useless to post a lot of articles to attract public opinion.

“”Did you offend someone?”Brother Tao continued to ask, “There must be someone manipulating public opinion behind the scenes. Otherwise, the popularity would not have risen so quickly!” ”

“If it wasn’t for someone manipulating from behind the scenes, the popularity wouldn’t have risen so quickly. ”

“Hearing this, Song Chenyu was stunned. ”

She had always been very popular in the circle. The only person she had offended was song yiwan.

But song Yiwan had long been banned. She simply didn’t have the ability to do so.

Could it be?

It was Cen Yuyan?

Song Chenyu narrowed his eyes.

It was definitely Cen Yuyan.

“From the moment she divorced Zhou Rui, Cen Yuyan had been making plans. ”

Cen Yuyan had always been an idiot in song Chenyu’s eyes.

“Therefore, song Chenyu had never taken Cen Yuyan to heart. ”

He did not expect that she would actually fall into Cen Yuyan’s hands this time.

“Brother Tao.”Song Chenyu grabbed brother Tao’s hand. “You must help me think of a way.”

Brother Tao pressed his temples. “The only way now is to get your parents to release a clarification video and tell everyone that this is all a misunderstanding.”

Clarification Video?

“This sentence was simple. If the Zhou family’s parents had clarified it so easily, they would not have gone to the trouble of finding the media. ”

“”80 million. Brother Tao, do you have 80 million?”Song Chenyu looked up at brother Tao. “Lend me 80 million!” ”

“80 million?”Brother Tao thought he had heard wrong. “Did you say 80 million? Not 8 million?”
