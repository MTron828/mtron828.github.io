Chapter 85: 073: Going to the capital, the anniversary party! 6

“Then we will accept your offer.”

The traffic in the capital was so heavy that it was difficult to get a taxi. Even if they wanted to book a taxi online, they had to make an appointment. Since there was a ready-made car, ye Zao did not refuse.

“Please.”

Cen Shaoqing opened the door of the car like a gentleman and carefully covered the roof of the car with his other hand.

“Thank you.”Ye Zhuo and Lin Sha sat in the car.

Seeing this, Li Qiandong was stunned. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

This was the first time he saw Cen Shaoqing being so considerate to a woman.

Ye Zhuo was probably the first girl to sit in Cen Shaoqing’s car.

Could it be...

Cen Shaoqing versus Ye Zhuo?

Although Cen Shaoqing and ye Zhuo were quite compatible.

But if they were together, what would happen to Mu Yourong?

Mu Yourong was so kind, vegetarian, and even knew how to play chess.

Although ye Zao was also very powerful, she was only a big shot in science and technology. She did not know how to play chess, did not know how to do business, did not know how to design, and was also not vegetarian...

Compared to Mu Yourong, Ye Zao was a technological geek.

And Mu Yourong was all-rounded.

So, in Li Qiandong’s eyes, Mu Yourong was still the most compatible with Cen Shaoqing!

She got into the car.

Lin Sha felt like she was dreaming,

the extended version of Lincoln...

She had only seen this kind of car on television before. She did not expect to not only see it today, but also get into the car.

Lin Sha nervously held ye Zao’s hand, her palm covered in a layer of sweat.

“Miss Ye, which hotel are you staying in?”

At this moment, a low voice sounded from inside the car.

Ye Zao narrowed his eyes and saw a well-defined profile. From ye Zao’s angle, he could see the man’s thin jaw and the sexy Adam’s apple hidden under his white collar.

Perhaps it was because he had been paying respects to Buddha for a long time, but there was a faint sandalwood scent on his body. In the enclosed workshop, the sandalwood scent was especially obvious.

“We’ve booked the New World Glorious Hotel at 1788 Bicheng Road.”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and turned around to instruct the driver to go to the New World Glorious Hotel.

The driver was also slightly stunned. His small eyes could not help but look at the rearview mirror.

He had worked for the CEN family for twelve years.

This was the first time he had seen Cen Shaoqing take the initiative to talk to the opposite sex.

Moreover, he did not know if it was an illusion, but he felt that Cen Shaoqing’s words had the intention of pleasing the little girl.

After a short while, the car arrived at its destination.

Cen Shaoqing got out of the car and opened the door.

“Thank you, Mr. Cen, for today,”Ye Zhuo took the initiative to thank him.

“Miss Ye, you’re too polite.”

Ye Zhuo continued, “I’ll treat you to a meal when I have time.”

“Okay.”

Ye Zhuo was stunned.

She was just casually saying it, but he did not expect Cen Shaoqing to actually agree to it.

The dignified CEN fifth master still needed someone to treat him to a meal?

Cen Shaoqing raised his eyebrows slightly.

Many people racked their brains, wanting to have some nepotism with him to have lunch with him, but this little girl actually gave him a perfunctory reply...

Could it be that he was some ferocious beast?

Li Qiandong said, “Guru, how many days are you going to stay in the capital? If you have time, let’s go out for a meal together?”

Cen Shaoqing replied indifferently, “It just so happens that miss ye still owes me a meal. I wonder if Miss Ye will still be in the capital on Saturday Night?”

“Then Saturday Night?”Ye Zao’s tone was clear and shallow.

Why did she feel like she was shooting herself in the foot?

“Then it’s a deal.”Cen Shaoqing twirled the prayer beads. “Tell me on Wechat.”

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

She did not want to have too many interactions with CEN Shaoqing, but now she was riding a tiger.

After Cen Shaoqing and Li Qiandong left, lin sha asked curiously, “Zao, is that Mr. Cen Super Powerful?”

“Yes.”

“How did you two meet?”Lin Shasha continued, “I think Mr. Cen is interested in You!”Besides, she felt that ye Zhonghua and Cen Shaoqing were quite a good match!

The handsome man and beautiful woman looked more and more pleasing to the eyes.

“That Mr. Cen is a vegetarian all year round, and he doesn’t marry,”ye Zhonghua said faintly.

“F * ck! Really? That’s such a pity...”such an outstanding man actually didn’t marry.

Li Qiandong and Cen Shaoqing got back into the car. “I really didn’t expect to meet the God in Beijing. Fifth brother, how do you feel about the god?”

Cen Shaoqing didn’t answer and asked instead, “Send Me Sitara’s live broadcast number.”

Li Qiandong frowned slightly. “Fifth brother, do you suspect that Sitara and the god are the same person?”

Cen Shaoqing didn’t say anything.

Li Qiandong continued, “They can’t be the same person! I saw the God doing missions on the technology website every day. How could she have time to live broadcast?”Besides, Sitara was just a cheating dog.
