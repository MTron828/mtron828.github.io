“Chapter 1198: 256: Si Lui suddenly came to his senses! Face-smacking, Lord Fifth’s vest dropped all over the floor! 7”

“Probably crying bitterly, he might even kneel down for her. ”

“Just as Zhao Xueyin was waiting for Si lui to kneel down for her, Si lui didn’t even look at Zhao Xueyin. He directly walked past Zhao Xueyin and walked forward. ”

“Zhao Xueyin was stunned, and her expression was a little awkward. ”

The lawyer wasn’t here to look for her?

Then why did he come to the 58th floor?

“A moment later, the lawyer’s voice came from the air. “President Ye, do you have time now?” ”

Ye Zhuo?

“Hearing this, the expression on Zhao Xueyin’s face became even more unsightly. ”

Ye Zhuo!

It was ye Zhuo again!

So the lawyer was here to look for ye Zhuo.

She knew that all of this was because of ye Zhuo.

“If it wasn’t for Ye Zao, lawyer Si wouldn’t have suddenly changed his heart. ”

Scum!

Slut!

“Zhao Xueyin bit her lip, her eyes filled with unwillingness. ”

Even though Zhao Xueyin didn’t like ye Zao.

“But when she thought of how lawyer Si had turned around and liked ye Zao, she felt extremely uncomfortable. ”

She thought that lawyer Si loved her.

So that was all.

Lawyer si followed ye Zao to the office.

“”President Ye, I’m Sorry.”Si Lu bowed to ye Zao. “I was the one who misunderstood you in the past. I even did a lot of malicious things to slander you.” ”

Although apologizing wouldn’t solve anything.

“But now, other than apologizing, Si Lu couldn’t think of any other way. ”

Ye Zao handed Si Lu a cup of coffee. “I don’t want to fuss over the past. I hope that you won’t make the same mistake again in the future.”

“Thank you.”Si lui took the coffee with both hands.

“Ye Zhuo looked at si lui and continued, “What are you going to do next?” ”

“”I quit,”Si lui said. ”

Ye Zhuo was not surprised. He nodded slightly. “This is a good thing for you.”

“Mm.”Si lui took a sip of coffee and nodded.

“Ye Zhuo looked at si lui and continued, “Your Eyes tell me that you haven’t completely given up on Zhao Xueyin. You still have fantasies about her.” ”

The things that were hidden in the bottom of his heart were revealed by ye Zhuo just like that.

Si Lui was stunned.

“How did ye, Ye Zhuo see through it? ”

“Humans are not plants. Who can be heartless? You and Zhao Xueyin have been together for so many years. It’s normal that you can’t let her go for a while. But I still want to say that Zhao Xueyin isn’t worth it for you to be like this.”

Si lui sighed. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

It wasn’t just that he couldn’t let her go.

He was also a little unwilling.

Five years.

“For five whole years, how did the innocent and kind girl in his heart become like that? ”

Perhaps.

Did she have any difficulties?

Si lui desperately tried to find an excuse for her.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “The reason why Zhao Xueyin treated you like this is entirely because of her nature. She didn’t have any difficulties. Do you know what happened between her and Jiang Xiaoyu?” ”

Si Lu shook his head.

Ye Zhuo flipped open the laptop with one hand. “Come and take a look at this.”

Si Lu walked over.

“When he saw the surveillance footage on the computer screen, he was completely stunned. ”

“The surveillance footage was not long. It was a total of ten minutes, but Si Lu felt as if a century had passed. ”

Barking like a dog?

Si Lu had never known that Zhao Xueyin would insult Jiang Xiaoyu like this.

No wonder Jiang Xiaoyu hated Zhao Xueyin so much.

“In the past, the lawyer always thought that the reason Jiang Xiaoyu turned against Zhao Xueyin was because ye Zhuo was sowing discord among them. Now, it seemed that things were not like this. ”

“Previously, in order to protect Zhao Xueyin, he almost slapped Jiang Xiaoyu. ”

The lawyer pinched his fingers.

So.

What did he love these five years?

Disgusting.

It was simply disgusting to the extreme.

“Si Lu’s stomach churned, and he started retching towards the trash can. ”

Ye Zhuo passed him a piece of dry tissue.

“”Thank you.”Si Lu took the tissue, his face a little pale. ”

“After a long while, Si Lu finally calmed down. “President Ye, I have treated you like that before, and even slandered you. Why can you still forgive me and show me these?” ”

“”But do good deeds and Mo Wen will have a bright future,”ye zhuo continued, “Moreover, your nature is not bad. It is just that you have fallen in love with the wrong person.” ”

But do good deeds and Mo Wen will have a bright future.

These words struck the deepest part of the lawyer’s heart.

“Thinking of all the things that he had done in the past, the lawyer was simply ashamed and ashamed! ”

Ten minutes later.

The lawyer arrived at the building of the Shunxi Financial Group.

It had snowed all day yesterday.

Today was a sunny day.

“Si lui looked up at the Sun, his eyes were full of warm light. ”

From today onwards.

His life began to turn a new page.

In the tall building next to him.

“Old Master Jin looked at Si Lui’s figure with binoculars, his eyes were full of gratification. ”

Five years.

Five whole years.

He had finally waited for this day.

On the other side.

DK Jewelry Center.

“The Day After Tomorrow was the annual party held by DK Financial Group. Since master five liked her so much, he would definitely invite her to attend the annual party. Hence, Zhao Xueyin dressed up and attended the party, coming to the jewelry center to choose her jewelry. ”

“As the Empress of DK Financial Group, she naturally couldn’t attend the annual party too shabbily. ”

“She had to bring out the aura of the Empress of DK Financial Group and wear her own brand of jewelry to attend her own annual party, ”

zhao Xueyin chose a lot of jewelry in one go.

“At this moment, a slender figure came to the same shop. ”

The man wore a plain-colored robe and held a string of Red Buddhist beads in his hand.

“As he walked, a powerful aura erupted, and all the passers-by turned to look at the prime minister. ”

“Zhao Xueyin turned her head and saw the figure of the man. She was stunned at first, but then her eyes were full of disdain. “Store manager Ma.” ”

“Miss Zhao.”Manager ma immediately walked to Zhao Xueyin’s side.

“Zhao Xueyin’s gaze swept past Cen Shaoqing. “Manager Ma, how can you be a manager? ! What kind of place is DK Jewelry Center? Why do you put all kinds of random people in there?” ”

Although the Cen family was very powerful in the capital.

Zhao Xueyin was not afraid of Cen Shaoqing at all.

“No matter how powerful CEN Shaoqing was, he could not compare to master five! ”

She was now the Woman Behind Master Five. What could a fake CEN Shaoqing do to her?

“After all, this was DK Jewelry Center! It was Master Five’s territory! ”

A cat or a dog?

Manager Ma was stunned.

Who Did Zhao Xueyin say was a cat or a dog?

Could she be talking about... that master?

“At this moment, Zhao Xueyin’s eyes lit up as she saw a familiar figure. ”

It was Li Chaoyang.

“Special Assistant Li!”

Why would Li Chaoyang appear at this time?

“He must have heard that she was shopping here, so he specially came to receive her! ”

Zhao Xueyin was extremely excited.

“However, Li Chaoyang acted as if he did not see Zhao Xueyin. He directly walked to Cen Shaoqing’s side and respectfully handed him a document. “Fifth master, this is the Jewelry Center’s performance report for the past six months.” ”
