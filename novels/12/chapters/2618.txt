Translator: 549690339

“Zhou Xiatian was very upset. She had thought of going to the house to rematch the two of them, but who would have thought that it would end up like this. ”

It was all Zhou Cuihua’s fault for not living up to expectations.

“”No, no,”Zhou Xiatian refused repeatedly, “I still have things to do at home!” ”

“Sun Guixiang also smiled and said, “Yes, yes, yes, I still have things to do at home. Dalong, you don’t have to be polite. We’re all on the same side.” ”

“Seeing that the two of them were really unwilling to stay, Li Dalong did not force them. He picked up the car keys and said, “Brother and sister-in-law, why don’t I Send You Back?” ”

“Zhou Xiatian said, “No need, no need. Your sister-in-law and I happen to have some matters to attend to nearby, so there’s no need to send us off.” ”

“Then I won’t send you off.”Li Dalong put down the car keys. “You mustn’t be polite with me.”

“”You’re welcome, you’re welcome. We’re all family, what’s there to be polite about?” ”

The couple turned around and left.

“After leaving the Li family home, Zhou Xia Tian was still in a daze. ” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Sun guixiang continued, “Old Zhou, it’s not that I want to say this, but your sister is really a piece of trash! Li Da Long treats her so well, but she’s still not satisfied and wants to marry a rich man! Just wait and see, she’ll definitely regret it!” ”

Regret was something that she would definitely regret. It was just a matter of time.

Zhou Xiatian did not say anything.

“Sun guixiang continued, “Old Zhou, what should we do now? Should we still look for your sister?” ”

“Who else should we look for now?”Zhou Xiatian asked back.

“Sun guixiang said, “If we knew that your sister would actually do such a shameless thing, we shouldn’t have come here. You Don’t even know that just now, I really wanted to find a hole to burrow into!” ”

Zhou Xiatian didn’t say anything because Zhou Cuihua wasn’t the only one who wanted to find a hole and hide in it. He also wanted to find a hole and hide in it!

“Zhou Xiatian sighed and said, “I don’t know what she’s thinking!” ”

“WHO KNOWS!”Sun Guixiang said.

“In Sun Guixiang’s opinion, the days before Zhou Cuihua’s divorce were her dream. ”

“She was a woman with no financial worries, no conflicts between her mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, and her husband did not cheat on her. She had a car, a house, and a harmonious family. ”

“However, Zhou Cuihua did not know how to be satisfied. ”

“Sun guixiang continued, “My words are a little harsh. Don’t mind me. I think your sister is an ugly person who causes trouble!” ”

“If it were her, if she were to live a life like Zhou Cuihua’s, she would wake up laughing in her dreams! ”

“If this was in the past, Zhou Xiatian would definitely scold Sun Guixiang to death. ”

“However, the situation now was different. ”

“At this time, Zhou Xiatian could only tacitly agree with Sun Guixiang’s words. ”

“Seeing that Zhou Xiatian did not speak, sun guixiang continued, “To be honest, only Li Dalong can tolerate someone like your sister. If it were anyone else, they would have long divorced...” ”

“The more Sun Guixiang spoke, the more enthusiastic she became. It was as if she would start a dyeing workshop if she was given some color. ”

“The more Zhou Xiatian heard, the angrier she became. She turned to look at Sun Guixiang. “You’re the only one who knows how to speak, right?” ”

Sun Guixiang’s words came to an abrupt end.

“Zhou Xiatian continued, “Do you think that I don’t feel bad after such a thing happened? But what can I do? As an elder brother, I’ve already done what I should have done!” ”

Zhou Xiaxia’s eyes turned red when she reached the end of her sentence.

“Sun Guixiang became anxious when she saw him like this, she continued, “Old Zhou, Old Zhou, don’t be anxious. This matter has nothing to do with you. I’m just talking about Cui Hua! Aiya, it’s all my fault, it’s all my fault! I Won’t say anymore! I Won’t say anymore, Alright?” ”

“You don’t understand my current feelings!”Zhou Xiaxia said.

“Sun guixiang continued, “Cuihua is already an adult. She can distinguish between good and evil. This kind of incident has nothing to do with you. Don’t blame yourself anymore.” ”

“At the end of her sentence, Sun Guixiang reached out and hugged Zhou Xiatian. She then comforted her, “Alright, Don’t cry. You’re a man. What does this matter matter?” ”

Zhou Xiatian’s eyes were really red.

He did not understand how Zhou Cuihua had come to this point. Her daughter was already so old. Was it not good to live a peaceful life? She had to do this!

“Sun guixiang continued, “Cuihua is not a child anymore. Let her handle her own matters. As her elder brother, you’re already competent enough! Don’t think too much and put yourself under pressure.” ”

“Zhou Xiatian nodded. “MMM, you’re right.”She still had to close the door and live her own life. ”

“Seeing that Zhou Xiatian had thought it through, Sun Guixiang heaved a sigh of relief. “Let’s go home now.” ”

Zhou Xiatian followed Sun Guixiang’s footsteps.
