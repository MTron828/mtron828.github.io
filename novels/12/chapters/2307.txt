Translator: 549690339

“Okay.”Lin Qingxuan immediately ran to Xiao Lin and picked him up.

Ye Shu and Xia Xiaoman came to the door and found Lin Jincheng already standing outside.

“Xia Xiaoman smiled and said, “Look, Jincheng is more anxious than you!” ”

“Ye Shu said, “He’s the most anxious person in the family, so giving birth to a son is completely different from giving birth to a daughter.” ”

“However, when ye Zhuo brought Cen Shaoqing back to meet the parents, Lin Jincheng was also very anxious. However, he was not this anxious. He was worried that ye Zhuo might have been deceived... ”

“You’re right.”Xia Xiaoman nodded.

“She also had a deep understanding of this point. Although an Lizi was not Lin Qingxuan’s biological child, Lin Qingxuan was more dedicated than his biological father. If an Lizi came home late one day, Lin Qingxuan would start to be extremely anxious, she remembered that an Lizi had missed a call from Lin Qingxuan the last time. Lin Qingxuan immediately found out the contact information of all of an Lizi’s classmates and called them to ask them one by one. ”

“Boys at least did not have to worry about being bullied outside, but girls were different. ”

“At this moment, a car slowly drove over from not far away. ”

“Outside the car, Ye Shu and the others immediately noticed Lin Ze’s car. In the car, Bai Jingshu also saw the people standing in front of the door. Her already calm heart suddenly became a little nervous. ”

“First, she lowered her head to look at her clothes. Then, she took out a small mirror to look at her makeup. ”

“Clearly, everything was fine, but Bai Jingshu was just nervous and nervous... ”

The car slowed down and slowly drove into the parking lot. Lin Ze turned to look at Bai Jingshu. “Don’t be nervous. It’s fine as long as you maintain your usual appearance.”

“Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded.

“Lin Ze continued, “Our relatives are very easy to talk to. Just follow behind me and call for help later.” ”

“Okay.”Bai Jingshu tried her best to calm herself down.

Lin Ze unbuckled his seatbelt and walked to the other side. He helped Bai Jingshu out of the car.

The two of them got closer and closer. Ye Shu felt that the girl beside Lin Ze was more and more familiar. She turned to look at Lin Jincheng. “Do you think the girl beside Ah Ze looks like a person?”

“Yes.”Lin Jincheng nodded.

“Ye Shu continued to ask, “Who do you think she looks like?” ”

“”Bai Jingshu,”Lin Jincheng answered. ”

“”Yes, yes, yes, it’s Jingshu!”Ye Shu did not expect that Lin Ze would actually be able to get together with Bai Jingshu. She said a little excitedly, “No wonder this kid has been hiding it all this time!” ”

“Xia Xiaoman asked curiously, “What kind of riddles are you two playing? Do you know this girl in private?” ”

Ye Shu nodded. “We do.”

“That’s fate! I think the little girl and Ah Ze are a good match!”

“Soon, Lin Ze brought Bai Jingshu to them. “Dad, Mom, fourth aunt, let me introduce you. This is my girlfriend, Bai Jingshu. Jingshu, you’ve met my parents before. This is fourth aunt.” ”

“”Hello, uncle, Auntie.”Bai Jingshu greeted Lin Jincheng and ye Shu first before turning to look at Xia Xiaoman, “Hello, fourth aunt. I’m Bai Jingshu, the white one. Jingshu, the white one. You can just call me by my name.” ”

“”Okay, okay, okay.”Xia Xiaoman held Bai Jingshu’s hand and smiled. “The little girl is really beautiful and has a good temperament. She’s a perfect match for Ah Ze!” ”

“Bai Jingshu was a little embarrassed by her praise. Just as Lin Ze had said, the Lin family’s relatives were more amiable. ”

“Ye Shu continued, “Jingshu, come in and sit down. Don’t stand outside anymore.” ”

“Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded and followed ye Shu’s footsteps.

“After entering the house, Bai Jingshu followed behind Lin Ze and got to know the others. “Jingshu, this is uncle. This is fourth uncle.” ”

“”Hello, Uncle.” ”

“Ye Sen nudged Lin Ze with his elbow. “Ah Ze, you can do it!” ” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“”Thank you, uncle,”Lin ze said in a low voice. ”

Ye Sen gave Lin ze a thumbs up.

“The two elders were sitting in the inner hall. Lin Ze brought Bai Jingshu to the inner court and introduced her. “Grandma, Grandma, this is my girlfriend, Bai Jingshu!” ”

“Bai Jingshu immediately said politely, “Hello, Grandma!” ”

“”Hello, Hello!”Old Madam Lin and ye Langhua grabbed Bai Jingshu’s hands from both sides, their eyes filled with kindness. ”

“Old Madam Lin took the opportunity to pass the jade bracelet on her hand to Bai Jingshu. “Jingshu, right? This is Grandma’s gift to you. From now on, we’ll be a family.”Although this was the first time they had met.., old Lady Lin knew that the Bai Jingshu in front of her would definitely become Lin Ze’s wife in the future. ”

“Old Lady Lin also wanted to wait until Lin Ze’s wedding day to personally give the jade bracelet to Bai Jingshu, but she knew that she wouldn’t be able to wait until that day. ”

“Bai Jingshu didn’t expect Old Lady Lin to suddenly make such a move, so she quickly refused. “Grandma, you’re too polite. I can’t afford such a precious thing!” ”

“Old Lady Lin pressed down on Bai Jingshu’s hand. “I can! I Can! Jingshu, if Ah Ze dares to bully you in the future, tell Grandma that I’ll help you vent your anger!” ”

“”Thank you, Grandma.” ”

“Through Old Lady Lin, Bai Jingshu seemed to see her own grandma. If the old lady was still around, she would be the same age as Old Lady Lin now. ”

“”Silly child, you don’t have to stand on ceremony with your grandmother.”Old Lady Lin looked at Bai Jingshu, her eyes filled with satisfaction. ”

“That night, the Lin family sat together and had a reunion dinner. ”

“Old Lady Lin looked at the whole family, young and old, and the corners of her mouth curled up into a faint smile. ”

“The whole process of meeting the parents was much easier than Bai Jingshu had imagined. The Lin family was very easy to get along with. It had only been less than a day, but they seemed to have become one with each other. ”

The next morning.

“Ye Shu was about to ask the kitchen to send some food to Old Lady Lin, but at that moment, the housekeeper’s panicked voice sounded, “Madam is in trouble!” ”

“What’s Wrong?”Ye Shu asked.

“The housekeeper continued, “Something happened to old lady, Old Lady!” ”
