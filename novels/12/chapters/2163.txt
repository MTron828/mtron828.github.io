“Did you guys get the wrong person?”Zhao Dan asked.

“”No.”Man Xing shook his head and continued, “Even if father and I got the wrong person, Ye Han, Leo, and Mr. Feng will not get the wrong person!” ”

“”Ye Han, Leo, and the others all went?”Zhao Dan asked. ”

“”Yes.”Man Xing nodded. “Not only them, many others went as well! Mom, you don’t know how glorious eldest sister was at the family recognition banquet today!” ”

Zhao Dan was in a bad mood when he heard that. “Does that mean that the matter between Ye Zhuo and Young Master Dongli didn’t Go South?”

“MAN XING said, “Mom, with these people around, which of the national advisor and the Great Elder of the General Alliance would dare to Say Anything?” ”

Who among them would dare to stand up against Ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing.

“If they went against Miss Ye, they would be going against the entire S galaxy! ”

“Besides, compared to Miss Ye, Duanmu Feng was nothing? ”

She wasn’t even a foil!

“Zhao dan continued, “W-what’s going on?”Why did that Earthling suddenly become ye Zhuo? ” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“If the matter between young master Dongli and Duanmu Feng didn’t go south, what would happen to man Xing? ”

“Man Xing helped Zhao Dan sit down. “Mom, don’t worry. Let me tell you slowly.” ”

“Okay.”Zhao Dan nodded.

Man Xing told Zhao Dan everything that had happened.

“”So, Ye Zhuo’s position wasn’t taken at all. She was just using a trick!”Zhao Dan looked at man Xing. ”

“Man Xing nodded. “Actually, it wasn’t a trick. Elder sister just wanted to draw a clear line between us.” ”

Zhao Dan snorted. “What a little B * Tch!”

“In front of outsiders, Zhao Dan would never say such disgraceful words. ”

She really hated ye Zao!

“Ye Zao was clearly her daughter, yet he did not share her heart. When she was deliberately trying to get close to him, ye Zao even ridiculed her! ”

He could not even compare to half of man Xing.

She really did not know how she gave birth to such a daughter!

“”Mom, don’t be angry,”man Xing said understandingly. “Actually, I quite understand elder sister. After all, she has suffered so much since she was young...” ”

“Looking at man Xing like this, man Jiangshan was very touched, but at the same time, he was a little worried. ”

“Man Xing was too kind. Kind people often didn’t have any good karma. He was afraid that one day, if he wasn’t around, man Xing would be schemed against because of this kindness. ”

Not Angry?

How could Zhao Dan not be angry?

“Thinking that he was actually deceived by that cheap girl, Ye Zhuo, Zhao Dan was extremely angry. ”

“Man Jiangshan looked at man Xing and said, “Xing ‘er, you’ve been tired all day. Go back and rest. Your mother and I should rest too.” ”

“Man Xing nodded, “Father and mother, you should rest early.”. “As for elder sister, don’t be angry. I believe that elder sister didn’t do it on purpose. Although I also hope to be able to recognize elder sister, since elder sister doesn’t want to recognize us, then forget it.” ”

“Whether it was from the perspective of his daughter or his sister, Manxing’s words were watertight. From the beginning to the end, he was thinking about ye Zhuo and was extremely kind. ”

Manjiangshan waved at Manxing. “Your mother and I will handle this matter. Don’t think too much. Go back and rest.”

“Okay.”Manxing nodded and turned to leave.

“Zhao Dan knew that man Jiangshan had sent man Xing away because he had something to say to her. He asked directly, “How do you plan to handle this matter?” ”

“”I need you to handle this matter,”man Jiangshan said. ”

“Zhao dan asked, “Are we going to announce this news directly?” ”

“Yes.”Man Jiangshan nodded.

“They had to announce it directly. If ye Zhuo dared to disown them as his biological parents, he would definitely be despised by others. ”

No matter how developed the human civilization was.

Filial piety would always be at the top of the list.

The people of the s galaxy placed great importance on filial piety!

“If ye Zao wanted to preserve his reputation, he had to acknowledge them! ”

“Then when is the appropriate time to announce it?”Zhao Dan asked.

“Man Jiangshan thought for a moment and then said, “This kind of thing should be done sooner rather than later. Let’s do it tomorrow!” ”

“Okay.”Zhao Dan nodded.

“Man Jiangshan continued, “You don’t need me to teach you how to do it, right?” ”

“”No need.”Zhao dan smiled and said, “I know what to do.” ”

“The man family was not an ordinary family. Back then, Zhao Dan was able to stand out from a group of competitors and become the Lady of the man family. Naturally, her methods could not be underestimated. ”

“However, she had been used to living a comfortable life these years. She did not have to do everything herself.
