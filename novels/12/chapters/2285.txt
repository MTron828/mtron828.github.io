Chen Jinyan sighed. “What’s there to admit! You Don’t understand the situation at all!”

“Then tell me! I want to see what kind of flowers you can come up with today!”Madam Chen said.

“Chen Jinyan continued, “Sit down and drink some water first to calm down.” ”

“”I’m already very calm now,”Madam Chen said. ”

“She had been restraining herself. If she had not calmed down, she would have already started fighting with Chen Jinyan. ”

“Chen Jinyan pressed on Madam Chen’s shoulder and sat down. “Suzhi, let me explain it to you.” ”

Madam Chen sat down.

“”Yaosheng offended a lot of people,”Chen Jinyan continued, “Not to mention me, even the captain could not bail him out.” ”

“Not only could he not save her, but he would also get himself into trouble. ” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“”Chen Jinyan, don’t give me excuses! Isn’t it just the Bai Family? What’s so great about them? How could they scare you so much?”Mrs. Chen said coldly, her eyes full of sarcasm. ”

“He offended more than the Bai family. Do you know who is standing behind Bai Jingshu?”Chen Jinyan asked.

“Who is it?”Mrs. Chen asked.

“”It’s Lin Ze,”Chen Jinyan answered. ”

“Lin Ze?”Mrs. Chen frowned slightly. She did not find Lin Ze’s name among the newly promoted nobles.

“Seeing Mrs. Chen like this, Chen Jinyan continued to explain, “Although Lin ze is just an ordinary earthling, he is Miss Ye’s brother, Cen Shaoqing’s future brother-in-law. Tell me, how can our family afford to offend such a person?” ”

“Hearing this, Mrs. Chen was immediately stunned. ”

She had never thought that Bai Jingshu would be so capable.

“”Then, then we can only watch Yaosheng go to jail?”Mrs. Chen turned to look at Chen Jinyan, her voice trembling. ”

Chen Jinyan nodded.

Tears almost burst out of Mrs. Chen’s eyes.

She could not accept the truth.

“Is there really no other way?”Mrs. Chen continued to ask.

“”No,”Chen Jinyan continued, “Unless Bai Jingshu agrees to close the case.” ”

Agree to close the case?

“If Bai Jingshu was really willing to close the case, things wouldn’t have developed to this stage. ”

“In the end, Mrs. Chen was helped out of the office by Chen Jinyan. ”

One day later.

The trial announced that Chen Yaosheng was sentenced to ten years in prison and deprived of his political rights for life.

Chen Jinyan and Mrs. Chen were not present on the day of the sentencing.

“Ever since they found out that the person behind the scenes was Lin Ze, the couple had kept a low profile. They had to avoid any suspicion that they should avoid. ”

They could not afford to offend the person behind Lin Ze.

Chen Yaosheng also received a warning from his father. He no longer made a fuss but confessed his mistake.

He really regretted it.

“If he had known that Lin Ze was ye Zao’s brother, he would not have fought with Lin Ze. ”

But now...

“If he could travel through time and space, he would definitely beat that stupid self to death. ”

“Although she was not present, Mrs. Chen was crying her heart out at home. ”

Ten years.

“From now on, if she wanted to see Chen Yaosheng, she would have to go to prison... ... ”

“When she thought of this, Mrs. Chen was in so much pain that she couldn’t breathe. ”

...

On the other side.

Bai Jingshu successfully landed on Earth with the interstellar shuttle.

“At the same time, she received the verdict of the court. ”

Ten years.

“When she saw this result, Bai Jingshu heaved a sigh of relief. ”

“After parking the interstellar shuttle, Bai Jingshu returned home to find that all the broken things in her house looked brand new. ”

It was as if nothing had happened.

Lin Ze must have done it.

“Thinking of Lin Ze, Bai Jingshu’s eyes curved. Not only Lin Ze, but everyone in the Lin family was very nice and warm. ”

“Unfortunately, she didn’t live in that kind of family. ”

Bai Jingshu took out her phone and called Lin Ze.

“Soon, the call went through. “Hello.” ”

“”Lin Xian...”Bai Jingshu realized that something was wrong and immediately changed her words. “Lin Ze, I’m back.” ”

“Have you solved all the problems over there?”Lin Ze asked.

“”Yes, everything has been solved.”Bai Jingshu continued, “Are you free tonight? If you’re free, let’s have dinner together.” ”

“Lin Ze hesitated for a moment on the other end of the phone before saying, “Okay.” ”

“What time are you free?”Bai Jingshu asked.

“”I’m free anytime. Just send me the time when you decide,”Lin ze replied. ”

“How about six o’clock then?”Bai Jingshu suggested.

“”Sure,”Lin ze replied. ”

“Bai Jingshu continued, “Then... we’ll meet at the rose at six o’clock?” ”

“Okay.”

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “Then you go ahead. I Won’t leave until I see you.” ”

“OK.”Lin Ze hung up the phone.
