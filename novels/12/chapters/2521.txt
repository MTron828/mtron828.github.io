Ye Zao looked at him and suddenly chuckled.

“What are you laughing at?”Cen Shaoqing looked up at Ye Zao. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Ye Zao continued, “I feel like you’re like an old father.” ”

Especially the way Cen Shaoqing wiped the tables and chairs.

“Cen Shaoqing smiled helplessly and said, “You’ve always been a child who hasn’t grown up.” ”

“After saying that, he continued to ask, “Is it that when I’m not by your side, you’ve never wiped the tables and chairs?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

She was used to being unscrupulous and did not have any mysophobia.

“Cen Shaoqing picked up the kettle and rinsed the tableware. “In that case, when you are alone in the future, don’t go out to eat.” ”

“”It’s okay.”Ye Zao smiled and said, “It’s not clean. You Won’t get sick if you eat it.” ”

Cen Shaoqing smiled faintly and did not say anything else.

“Very soon, the cooked spicy hotpot was served. ”

It was an old-fashioned spicy hot pot with pure bone soup. There was no milk or other messy things added. It was mixed with a faint herbal fragrance and smelled very fragrant.

“Ye Zhuo picked up his chopsticks and took a bite of potato chips. As expected, it was still a familiar taste. ”

The capital at night appeared quiet and peaceful.

“After eating, the two did not go back immediately. Instead, they sat at the dining table and chatted. ”

A rolls-royce drove by the roadside.

“In a flash, it went back again. ”

“The Man in the driver’s seat widened his eyes and looked at the roadside. He asked with some uncertainty, “Is that master five?” ”

“Which one?”The Man in the front passenger seat asked.

“The one who eats spicy hot soup by the roadside.”

“Hearing that, the man in the front passenger seat laughed out loud. “What are you thinking! How could master five Cen Eat Street Food?”And it was junk food like spicy hot soup! ”

“Not to mention Cen Wu Ye, even they would not eat such a thing. ”

“But I really look like Cen Wu Ye! Why Don’t you take a look again?”

“The Man in the co-pilot seat did not even want to take a look. He continued, “Chen Qiang, you’re really mistaken!” ”

“At this moment, the two people who were originally sitting there stood up. ”

It looked like they were about to leave.

“Chen Qiang continued, “They’re about to leave. Quick, take a look.” ”

“The Man in the front passenger seat turned his head to take a perfunctory look. When he took a look, he was immediately stunned. “D * MN! They really look alike!” ”

“Very similar, very similar. ”

“Chen Qiang said, “Should we go up and say Hello?” ”

“”Wait,”the man in the front passenger seat continued, “What if we’ve mistaken them for someone else! Let’s see where they’re going first!” ”

“Okay.”Chen Qiang nodded.

“Not long after, Cen Shaoqing and ye Zhuo walked to the parking spot. ”

“Cen Shaoqing went around to the passenger seat, opened the door, and even put his hand on the roof of the car. ”

Ye Zhuo sat in the passenger seat.

Cen Shaoqing followed closely behind and returned to the driver’s seat.

Chen Qiang rubbed his eyes and turned to look at the passenger seat. “Am I seeing things? Are they driving a Volkswagen?”

“The Man in the co-pilot’s seat also widened his eyes and said, “I didn’t see wrongly!” ”

It was a Volkswagen!

“With that, the man in the co-pilot’s seat continued, “I knew it was definitely not Cen Wuye!” ”

“It was one thing to eat spicy hotpot, but how could Cen Wuye drive a Volkswagen! ”

Cen Wuye’s car was either a Lamborghini Supercar or a handsome Hummer. The worst of them all was Xia Li!

What was Volkswagen?

Nothing!

“Chen Qiang said, “Fortunately, we took a look. Otherwise, we would have mistaken him for someone else.” ”

“The Man in the front passenger seat continued, “Let’s Go!” ”

“Since he had confirmed that it was not CEN fifth master, there was no need to stay here. ”

Chen Qiang started the engine and drove away.

“On the other side, Cen Shaoqing sent ye Zhuo home. When they reached the Cen family manor, it was almost 1 am. ”

The lights in the living room were still on.

“The moment Cen Shaoqing entered the living room, he saw old Mrs. Cen sitting on the sofa. ”

“When she saw Cen Shaoqing return, Old Mrs. Cen immediately stood up from the sofa. “Shaoqing!” ”

“”Grandma, Why are you still up so late?” ”

Old Mrs. Cen yawned. “I’m Not Sleepy.”

Cen Shaoqing:”...”he really believed her.

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Is your eldest brother-in-law’s wife pregnant?” ”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “Then your father-in-law really has a double wedding coming!” ”

“After saying that, old Mrs. Cen continued, “Right, have you discussed with Zhonghua when the wedding will be held?” ”

“”Not yet,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“It was not that he did not want to tell ye Zhuo, but that this kind of matter had to be handled by the elders. ”

“In front of Lin Jincheng, he was just a junior. ”

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “I was just about to discuss this matter with you.” ”
