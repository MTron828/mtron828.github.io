Chapter 57: This Is Ye Zhuo?

He won’t live past 35 years old?

Yi Tao was already 32 years old this year.

If he didn’t live past 35 years old, wouldn’t he only have a few years left to live?

Hearing this, Li Wenru’s face immediately turned pale. She grabbed Ye Zhuo’s hand. “Miss Ye! Please save our Tao Tao!”

Ye Zhuo continued, “Auntie, if we don’t get rid of the bad seed, even if Hua Tuo[1] is still alive, he wouldn’t be able to save Mr. Yi.” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Yi Xuezheng frowned slightly, “Miss Ye, are you saying that there is a bad seed in our family, and Tao Tao’s illness is man-made?”

Ye Zhuo nodded.

In fact, from the beginning, Ye Zhuo already felt that there was something wrong with Yi Tao’s illness.

This was because the Annox disease was too rare.

In addition to that, seeing Li Qingyue today, she was even more certain of her thoughts.

There was definitely something wrong with this Li Qingyue!

At this moment, Li Wenru seemed to have understood the meaning behind Ye Zhuo’s words and was shocked, “Who is the person who wants to harm Tao Tao?”

Ye Zhuo’s expression was indifferent, “If Mr. Yi’s were to die, this person would benefit the most out of Mr. Yi’s death.”

Li Wenru frowned tightly.

Currently, there were only five people in the Yi family.

She and Yi Xuezheng would definitely not harm their own child.

Then…

The only other people left were Qingyue and Chen Qiaoye.

Yi Xuezheng also arrived at the same conclusion as his wife. “Could it be either Qingyue and Qiao Ye?”

Li Wenru’s face turned pale.

One of them was her daughter-in-law, and the other was her biological niece…

Could it be one of them?

Ye Zhuo continued, “Mrs. Yi still has no children, and killing Mr. Yi would do her no good. Besides, if she really wanted to kill Mr. Yi, she wouldn’t insist on using my medicine. Moreover, I can see from Mrs. Yi’s eyes that she values Mr. Yi more than herself.”

It was clear that Chen Qiaoye was not that kind of person.

“Then…” Li Wenru’s heart turned cold, and her blood froze. “Could… Could it be Qing Yue?”

Ye Zhuo continued, “Miss Li is your biological niece. If anything happens to Mr. Yi, she will be your only family in this world. And if I am not wrong, I believe Miss Li must have thought that Mr. Yi was dead before the truth was presented to her.”

Hearing this, Wenru Li and Xuezheng Yi’s hearts skipped a beat because Ye Zhuo was right.

At the Yi family’s house, Li Qingyue was full of condolences. If it wasn’t for her misguidance, they wouldn’t have thought that Yi Tao was dead.

Qingyue seemed to have been prepared for Yi Tao’s death.

Moreover, ever since they found out about Yi Tao’s condition, the couple did indeed have the intention of letting Qingyue inherit the Yi Corporation.

So, just like what Ye Zhuo said, Qingyue was the direct beneficiary of Yi Tao’s death!

“She was still so young when she lost her parents. I raised her whole-heartedly! How…How could she do this to me! How could she do this to Tao Tao! I am her biological aunt!” Li Wenru cried out sorrowfully.

Yi Xuezheng’s face was tense and his eyes were filled with anger. Although he was not related to Li Qingyue by blood, he treated Li Qingyue like his own daughter.

‘D*mn it!

‘How could she do this!’

“You should never feed an ingrate.” Ye Zhuo patted Li Wenru’s back and comforted her, “Fortunately, Mr. Yi is fine now. Auntie, it’s not worth it to be sad over an ingrate.”

Despite hearing Ye Zhuo’s words, Li Wenru was still very sad. She couldn’t figure out why Li Qingyue had turned out this way.

“I want to go out and confront her! I want to ask her why she did this to Tao Tao!” Li Wenru walked out angrily.

Ye Zhuo pulled Li Wenru back, “Auntie! You are too impulsive!”

Li Wenru looked at Ye Zhuo in confusion.

Ye Zhuo continued, “We have no evidence now. If she doesn’t admit it, it will alert the snake.”

Yi Xuezheng nodded, “Miss Ye is right. Wenru, you are too impulsive!”

After saying that, Yi Xuezheng bowed to Ye Zhuo, “Thank you for your advice, Miss Ye. I know what to do!”

After all, Yi Xuezheng was a businessman. As the saying goes, the older the wiser. It wouldn’t take much effort to deal with Li Qingyue.

“It’s good that you know what to do, Uncle.”

When the three of them came to the living room again, Li Wenru and Yi Xuezheng faces had returned to normal.

Li Qingyue went up to them nervously, “Auntie, is Cousin okay?”

Li Wenru smiled and shook her head, “It’s nothing serious. Qingyue, you don’t have to worry.”

“It’s good that he’s okay. I was so worried just now.” Li Qingyue patted her chest.

Li Wenru looked up at her niece and felt that she was looking at a stranger.

For so many years, she had actually raised a poisonous snake with its tongue sticking out.

Luckily, she found out about it in time.

Thank goodness!

…

North Bridge High School, Class 606.

Today was the start of school, so everyone came early. Only Ye Zhuo’s was still empty, and everyone was talking about it.

“Why do you guys think Mu Zhuo isn’t here yet?”

“Her name isn’t Mu Zhuo anymore, it’s Ye Zhuo wow! She should take a look at herself! With that ghastly appearance, she still has the cheek to cling on the surname Mu?”

“Our school belle, Mu Yourong, is a hundred times prettier than her! She can’t even compare to a single finger of the school belle. A fake is a fake! If I were her, I would be embarrassed to come.”

“Ye Zhuo is too shameless! She actually impersonated the Mu family’s eldest daughter! Disgusting!”

An Lizi was sitting in her seat. When she heard these words, her fair little face was filled with anger. Finally, she could not take it anymore. She slammed the table and stood up. “Stop talking! It was not Zhuo Zhuo’s intention at all. She was so young back then, how could she decide that for herself?”

“An Lizi, who do you think you are? If you tell us not to talk, we won’t talk? Ye Zhuo is disgusting and shameless! She did it on purpose! Otherwise, why wouldn’t she dare to come to school?”

“That’s right, that’s right!”

Creak—

At this moment, a crisp sound of the door being pushed opened could be clearly heard.

“I’m sorry to disappoint you. I’m here.”

The originally noisy classroom quieted down at this moment.

Everyone raised their eyes and looked toward the door.

They saw a figure walking over.

The girl’s figure was slender and she wore a clean white school uniform. Her black short skirt contrasted with her straight and slender legs. At this moment, she looked even more slender and her clean face was not covered with makeup.

Not a speck of dust could be seen on her.

Her beautiful black hair was tied up into a bun, revealing her fair and beautiful swan neck. In her demure manner, she revealed a tinge of playfulness, but at the same time, she looked gracious. She was even more resplendent than the moon that was surrounded by stars.

Holy sh*t!

She was too beautiful!

Even more beautiful than Mu Yourong, the school belle.

Who was this?

A new transfer student?

Heads turned as everyone’s gaze followed Ye Zhuo’s steps.

Just as Ye Zhuo gently sat down on her seat, a cold gasp sounded in the air.

This… This was Ye Zhuo?

How was that possible?

“Classmate, classmate, you seem to have sat in the wrong seat.” After a long while, her deskmate, An Lizi cautiously spoke up.
