Translator: 549690339

“Just as Chen Qiaoye said, Han Dongliang’s current condition was very bad, and his life could be in danger at any time. ”

“After a moment, ye Zao released his hand. ”

“Chen Qiaoye hurriedly asked, “Godly Doctor Ye, how is it?” ”

Han Laoshan and Mrs. Han also looked at Ye Zao with anticipation.

“”The situation is already very serious, but don’t worry, this is still the best time for treatment!” ”

“Hearing this, everyone heaved a sigh of relief. ”

“After saying that, ye Zhuo continued, “Not all patients are suitable for a sterile room! A sterile room is usually used for burns or for patients undergoing major surgery to avoid infection.” ”

“Speaking up to this point, Ye Zhuo turned to look at Han Laoshan. “Elder Han, immediately get someone to demolish the sterile room and keep the room ventilated!” ”

“Han Laoshan immediately nodded. “Alright, I’ll get someone to arrange it right away!” ”

“Mrs. Han looked at Ye Zhuo. “President Ye, my, my son, does he really have any hope of recovering?” ”

“En.”Ye Zhuo nodded.

“Chen qiaoye smiled and said, “Aunt, Congratulations! Since Miracle Doctor Ye has said so, then cousin will definitely recover!” ”

Mrs. Han nodded excitedly. “Okay!”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “In addition, get someone to brew this medicine immediately. Drink it three times a day for a month and you’ll see the effect.” ”

Han Laoshan took the important medicine and handed it to the butler. “Quick! Go Brew the medicine quickly!”

“Ye Zhuo put away the medicine box. “That’s all for today. Elder Han, I still have something to do, so I’ll be leaving first.” ”

“Han Lao Shan was a little stunned. “President Ye, is that all? Is there no other medicine?” ”

“Compared to other traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, Ye Zhuo had fewer cumbersome steps. ”

This made Han Lao Shan a little uncomfortable.

“After all, Han Dongliang was suffering from a very serious illness. Would Ye Zhuo be able to take the medicine just by giving it to him? ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Don’t worry, I’m treating the symptoms according to the medicine. These are enough.” ”

Han Laoshan nodded.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Mr. Little Han will wake up in about three days. So, I will come back for a follow-up consultation in three days.” ”

“”Three days?”Han Laoshan said in surprise, “President Ye, are you sure?” ”

“Ever since Han Dongliang fell into a coma, he had never woken up again. ”

“At this moment, ye Zhuo said that Han Dongliang would wake up in three days. Han Laoshan was in disbelief. ”

“”En.”Ye Zhuo’s eyes remained the same. “However, you must do as I say. You Can’t use the sterile room anymore. Then, take this medicine three times a day.” ”

“Han Laoshan continued, “No, don’t you need to take bezoar pills?” ”

“No.”Ye Zhuo shook his head slightly. “Bezoar pills are used to treat strokes. Mr. Xiao Han’s main cause of illness is a viral infection. Eating Bezoar pills won’t help.”

Viral infection?

Han Luoshan was stunned again. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

But doctor Liu clearly said that the coma was caused by the stroke.

Now...

Who should he trust?

“The cause of the illness diagnosed by both of them was different. If he were to use the medicine rashly, what if, what if something went wrong... ”

Han Luoshan did not dare to imagine the consequences.

“Even after sending ye zhuo out of the Han family, Han Luoshan still could not react. ”

“At this moment, the workers took their tools and walked towards the sterile room. ”

“Wait!”Han Laoshan suddenly said.

“Master.”

“Han Laoshan continued, “Don’t touch the sterile room for now.” ”

“Chen Qiaoye was anxious. “Uncle, Miracle Doctor Ye said that the sterile room will aggravate cousin’s condition!” ”

Han Laoshan looked at Chen Qiaoye and voiced his concerns.

The cause of the illness that ye Zhuo diagnosed was different from doctor Liu’s. He could not believe her.

“Chen Qiaoye said, “Uncle, when Yi Tao was sick, Miracle Doctor Ye’s diagnosis was also different from the doctor’s. At that time, no one believed that miracle doctor ye could cure Yi Tao. Even my mother-in-law did not believe it. But in the end, Miracle Doctor Ye did Cure Yi Tao! “If it wasn’t for Miracle Doctor Ye, the current Yi Tao wouldn’t exist!” ”

“At the end of her sentence, Chen Qiaoye said directly, “Uncle, if you don’t believe in Miracle Doctor Ye, you will definitely regret it for the rest of Your Life!” ”

Regret for the rest of your life!

“This sentence made Mrs. Han’s eyebrows jump. She immediately stood up and said, “I believe! I believe in Miracle Doctor Ye! Old Han, you should believe it too! Our pillar is already like this now. How Bad Can he be?” ”

“A moment later, Han Laoshan let out a long sigh. “Alright! Then I’ll make a bet!” ”

“The workers at the side said, “Then do we still need to continue to demolish the sterile room?” ”

“Demolish it!”Han Laoshan said.

“Seeing this, Chen Qiaoye heaved a sigh of relief. “Uncle and aunt, I believe that in the near future, the two of you will definitely be very glad about this decision today!” ”
