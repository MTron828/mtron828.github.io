Translator: 549690339

“”I think it’s quite similar!”Cen Hai continued, “I used to think that master five and Miss Ye were married, so master five would definitely be in charge. Who knew that Miss Ye’s gaze would scare master five to death.””

“”If Master Five isn’t afraid of Miss Ye, can he ask Miss Ye to lead?””

The few of them spoke as they walked forward.

Cen Shaoqing pushed the door open and came inside.

“Ye Zhuo picked up the windbreaker hanging on the clothes rack. “You’re here. Come, let’s go to the cafeteria to eat.””

“I bought this.”Cen Shaoqing placed the takeaway box on the office desk. “Let’s eat in the office for lunch.”

“It smells so good!”Ye Zhuo’s eyes lit up. “Is it Yun Ji’s hot and sour powder?”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“When did you go?”Ye Zao asked in surprise.

“Yun Ji’s spicy and sour noodles were not listed on the takeaway website. If one wanted to eat it, they had to go by themselves.”

“I just went.”

Ye Zao opened the packaging. “You bought duck necks and duck feet?”

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “The granny inside recommended me to buy them.””

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “I haven’t eaten their duck’s feet and neck yet!”Zhao Pingting had brought ye Zao to eat in this restaurant. She had only eaten it once, but she couldn’t forget the taste. It was just a casual remark, unexpectedly, Cen Shaoqing remembered it.”

“I heard it tastes good.”Cen Shaoqing sat down and rolled up his sleeves.

“Ye Zhuo took out the food and placed a plate in front of CEN Shaoqing. “By the way, I heard that Professor Yue and all the members of his research room went on strike.””

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“”What do you plan to do now?”Ye Zhuo opened the lid of the box and immediately, a fragrant smell assaulted him.”

“It was sour, spicy, and fresh. There was a layer of red oil and coriander floating on it. When stirred, the already rich fragrance became even stronger.”

“Cen Shaoqing put the Buddha beads aside and said, “Just let the A-2 members fill in.”Cen Shaoqing had trained many talents in the base. Professor Yue thought that their research lab occupied the core area in Area B, as long as all the members of their research lab went on strike, there would be paralysis in Area B. Little did they know that the A-2 members could be substitutes at any time.”

“Not to mention a single research lab going on strike, even if all ten research labs went on strike, it would not affect Cen Shaoqing.”

Professor Yue’s threat couldn’t even withstand a single blow.

“”That’s good.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and ate a mouthful of hot and sour powder. The taste was thick beef flavor, followed by the freshness of the dolphin bone soup. Finally, the refreshing hot and sour taste was very layered, and the taste was very good, it made people want to swallow their tongues.”

“After a mouthful of powder, ye Zhuo picked up a duck neck. Then, he was surprised to find that the duck neck and duck feet tasted very good.”

“”Leader, how does it taste?”Cen Shaoqing raised his head and asked.”

“”Very good,”ye Zao continued, “When we have time, let’s go to their restaurant to eat together.””

“Okay.”

...

On the other side.

“Tang Xue received two slaps from ye Zao for nothing. The more she thought about it, the more uncomfortable she felt.”

She and Ye Zao were both members of the base. What right did ye Zao have to hit her?

Just wait.

She would definitely find an opportunity to redeem herself and take revenge for today. She would make ye Zhuo pay back tenfold.

“At this moment, Xu Guo ran in. “Sister Xue! Sister Xue! Something Big has happened!””

“What big thing has happened?”Tang Xue looked at Xu Guo.

“Xu Guo’s face showed a faint look of excitement. She took a deep breath and said, “All the members of Professor Yue’s research lab have gone on strike!””

“On strike?”Tang Xue narrowed her eyes and stood up from her chair. “What’s Going On?”

“Xu Guo continued, “It seems that it’s because master five asked Professor Yue to retire early!”” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Early retirement?

“According to Professor Yue’s current age, early retirement had nothing to do with direct dismissal. Under normal circumstances, the members of the base would not be retired early if they did not remember any major offenses.”

“Why did master five allow Professor Yue to retire early?”Tang Xue asked.

Professor Yue had been in the base for many years and had made a lot of contributions to the base.

“Hearing this news, Tang Xue was still very surprised.”

“After saying that, Tang Xue continued, “Just because Professor Yue brought people to Big C district to cause trouble for ye Zhuo?””

Xu Guo nodded. “I heard that’s the case!”

Tang Xue narrowed her eyes. “The heavens will punish the MANIAC!”

Just wait.

Ye Zhuo was about to receive his retribution.

Professor Yue’s research room was the most important research room in area B. No one else could replace it!

“This time, if Cen Shaoqing wanted to appease professor Yue’s anger and restore order in Area B, he had to show his sincerity.”
