Chapter 126: 079: confirmed date of return, strange bite Mark 5

“Zao Zao, what’s going on here?”Ye Sen’s eyes were sharp, and he immediately saw the abnormality on ye Zao’s arm.

“It’s been there since I was very young. I think it was bitten by a child I played with.”

Ye Zao was also a little curious about this bite mark.

Because in her previous life, she had an identical bite mark on her elbow.

She didn’t expect the original owner to have the same bite mark.

Could it be a coincidence?

Ye Sen frowned. “Bite? Which Child is so disobedient? Does it hurt?”

Ye Zao smiled and said, “It hurt a little at that time, but it doesn’t hurt anymore now.”

In the blink of an eye, it was night time.

The family of three sat together for New Year’s Eve dinner.

The Spring Festival Gala was on the TV.

Ye Shu cooked a lot of dishes tonight. There was hot pot and all kinds of chicken, duck, and fish.

Ye Sen stood up with his cup in his hand. “Sister, this is the first new year since we came back. It’s also the first New Year for us to have a new life. I wish that our days in the future will be more prosperous! Cheers!”

“Cheers!”Ye Shu and ye Zao also stood up with their cups in their hands.

At this moment, colorful fireworks were reflected outside the window.

The deafening sound of fireworks could be heard in the air.

Looking at the fireworks outside the window, Ye Zao’s lips curled into a faint smile. “Mom, Uncle, after dinner, shall we go and set off the fireworks too?”

“Sure.”Ye Sen nodded.

Ye Shu smiled and said, “Your nephews can go. I Won’t go.”Tomorrow morning was the first day of the Lunar New Year. Ye Shu still had a lot of things to do.

After saying that, Ye Shu took out a red packet and gave it to ye Zao. “Zao Zao, this is your new year’s money. Mom wishes you to get on the gold roll in the college entrance examination next year!”

“Thank you, Mom.”Ye Zao was stunned for a moment and took the red packet with both hands.

“And uncle’s too.”Ye Sen also gave ye Zao a red packet. “Your Mom has already wished you the best in the exam. Then I wish my niece is eighteen years old and as beautiful as a flower!”

“Thank you, Uncle!”

Ye Zao never knew that being able to receive new year’s money was such a blessing.

It was so good to have a family!

After the New Year’s Eve dinner, Ye Zao and Ye Sen went outside to set off fireworks.

There was a lot of noise outside, accompanied by the sound of fireworks. It was especially lively.

Ye Sen picked up a firework. “Eldest niece, do you dare to light this Cuotian Monkey?”

“What’s there to be afraid of?”Ye Zao’s eyes were indifferent. “I’ve even lit a bomb.” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Stop bragging!”Ye Sen did not take ye Zao’s words to heart.

Ye Zao also did not explain. He took the Cuan Tianhou and lit it up.

Biu —

Bang!

The Cuan Tianhou rushed out in an instant and exploded on the horizon.

Throughout the entire process, ye Zao did not even close his eyes or cover his ears.

He was extremely calm.

She did not seem like a little girl at all.

Ye Sen was stunned. His niece seemed to be a little tiger!

“Light that big firework.”Ye Sen pointed at the big firework beside him.

“OK.”Ye Zao made an ‘OK’gesture and squatted down to light the firework.

Ye Sen had specially bought this firework.

It was said that some heavenly lady was scattering the firework, and it was very beautiful.

The ignition powder was lit, and a firework bullet rushed out.

But after a long time, there were no fireworks.

Ye Sen frowned slightly. Could it be that the seller lied to him?

Just as ye Zao turned around.

Countless fireworks bloomed from behind her.

Bang!

The sky was filled with dazzling fireworks, outlining ye Zao’s clear outline.

Ye Sen quickly picked up his phone and recorded this beautiful moment.

His eldest niece was simply too beautiful.

Ye Sen’s editor posted on his wechat moments, [ show off, this is my eldest niece. ]

At the same time, Ye Zao’s phone rang.

Ye Zao took out his phone from his pocket.

It was a wechat message.

The first to send wechat messages were an Lizi and Zhao Pingting.

Then it was Lin Sha Sha.

Ye Zao sent a video of himself setting off fireworks to the three of them, and then he sent the three of them a lucky money red packet.

Because it felt good to receive lucky money.

Therefore, ye Zao wanted to pass on this happiness.

After replying to the messages from the three of them, Ye Zao received another message of blessing.

[ Happy New Year. ]

It was from Cen Shaoqing.

This was probably the first time the two of them sent messages since they added wechat.

Ye Zao also sent a message of Happy New Year.

He also sent a red packet with the remarks [ Lucky Money. ]

Cen Shaoqing on the other end of the screen was stunned.

He had grown up.

This was the first time someone gave him new year’s money apart from his parents and family.

Moreover, this thing called New Year’s money.

He had not received it since he was 18 years old.

He opened the red envelope.

The money was not much.

It was only 88 yuan.

Cen Shaoqing also sent a red envelope with the caption “Return the favor.”
