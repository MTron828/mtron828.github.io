“Cen Hai smiled and said, “That’s great! I want to tell the others about this good news immediately!””

In the laboratory.

“Ye Zhuo sorted out the ice crystal report and entered it into the database. After that, not only did he not slow down, he opened his computer and logged onto the international website.”

The international website’s homepage was news about the betting agreement.

“Dr. Cara and doctors from five other countries had issued a statement, saying that there were loopholes and unreasonable clauses in the betting agreement. It was completely different from the agreement they had signed. Moreover, when they signed the agreement.., it had not been notarized by a formal organization, so the agreement could not take effect. The management rights of their experimental base could not be handed over to ye Zao!”

The notary office indicated that they had indeed not received any notarization of the betting agreement.

“The Notary Office threw the blame. If ye Zao could not come up with strong evidence, then he would be labeled as the Overlord Clause, unequal agreement, secretly changing the betting agreement, and so on.”

[ YC is too shameless! How could they do such a thing! And they even secretly changed the contents of the agreement! Do they really think that our country C has no one? ]

“[ just because they created a lightspeed aircraft carrier, they can bully people without restraint? Disgusting! ]”

“[ if YC, professor Cara, and the others really went to the notary office, then why did the notary office issue a statement saying that they did not see the relevant agreement? ]? It was fine if they did not go through the notary office, but YC actually secretly changed the agreement. Did they really think that there was no reasonable place in this world? ]”

“I have to admit that YC is indeed a very good scientist, but at the same time, there is also a big problem with her character! Otherwise, she would not have changed the agreement. There is a Chinese saying that goes, “The river flows east for thirty years, and the river flows west for thirty years. Just wait and see!”! Sooner or later, she will get her comeuppance”

“I am really going to die of anger! When that Kara came to clamor that the gambling agreement was effective, why did no one say that there was a loophole in the agreement”

[ that’s right! This operation is too coquettish! It’s disgusting! ]

[ don’t Gamble if you can’t afford to lose! ]

The people in the comments section were divided into two groups. One group was on Dr. Karla’s side and supported Dr. Karla.

The other group was naturally on Dr. Ye’s side!

C nation.

“Worker Xu brought the backbone of the base to do the handover work. Who knew that Dr. Karla would suddenly turn the tables and refuse them entry into the country. Therefore, they could only find a hotel to stay in for the time being.”

Worker Xu was very anxious as he paced around the hotel conference room.

“Yang Hua, who was beside him, stood up and said, “Worker Xu, why don’t we go back to the country first? It’s not a big deal to just stay in the hotel like this!””

“Worker Xu pressed his temples and asked, “What did Miss Ye Say?””

Yang Hua shook his head. “There’s still no reply from Miss Ye’s side for the time being.”

No reply?

“Hearing that, the anxiety in worker Xu’s eyes became even more obvious.”

“”Worker Xu! Worker Xu!”At that moment, the assistant suddenly ran in from outside the door.”

“What’s wrong? Did Miss ye reply?”Worker Xu immediately looked back.

The assistant nodded. “Yes!”

“What did Miss Ye Say?”Worker Xu followed up with a question.

“The assistant said, “Miss Ye said that before tonight, Dr. Cara will definitely bring people over to apologize to US personally.””

“Hearing that, worker Xu was stunned.”

The other people in the meeting room were also stunned.

Apologize?

Would Dr. Cara apologize so easily?

“After a moment, worker xu reacted and asked, “Are you sure what Miss Ye Said?””

“The assistant nodded. “It was team four CEN who called personally! If you don’t believe me, you can call again and ask!””

“Xu Gong picked up his phone and called Cen Hai. After receiving a confirmation, Xu Gong hung up the phone and turned to look at the crowd. “Since Miss Ye has indeed said so, let’s wait a little longer.””

Yang Hua lowered his head to look at his watch. “It’s already past three in the afternoon. Are you sure that Kara will come and apologize to us?”

The others were also discussing animatedly. They felt that this matter was somewhat unreliable. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“What if Kara doesn’t come and apologize to us?”

“Worker xu said, “We’ll do as Miss Ye says first. If Kara doesn’t come, we’ll contact miss ye again.””

“Alright.”Yang Hua nodded.

In the International Department.

Dr. Cara was sitting in the minister’s office.

“The minister looked at Cara worriedly and said, “Dr. Cara, do you think we’ll be found out if we do this?””
