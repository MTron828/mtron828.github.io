Cen Shaoqing directly denied it. “Of course not!”

“But I see that you have the potential to be a strict wife.”Cen Yueya narrowed her eyes.

Cen Shaoqing’s expression was the same as usual. “You’re mistaken.”

“”Hur Hur.”Cen Yueya had a wicked smile on his face. “Back then, someone even said that he didn’t want to get married!” ”

Cen Shaoqing:”...”

In the blink of an eye.

Today was the last day of the military training.

The last day was for the military training parade. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“After fifteen days of devil-like training, everyone’s skin had turned a few degrees darker. ”

“Especially Li Yueyue. Even if she wore sunscreen, the skin on her face and neck was still a few shades darker. ”

“Li Yueyue looked at ye Zao enviously. “Big Zao Zao, why aren’t You Black?” ”

Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly. “Maybe it’s because I’m naturally beautiful?”

“Li Yueyue whimpered and hugged ye Zao. “I want to be naturally beautiful too. Oh right, I heard that the new campus Belle selection is going to be held tomorrow. Do you want to sign up?” ”

Ye Zao shook his head slightly. “No.”

“Li Yueyue said regretfully, “Why?”With Ye Zao’s looks, he would definitely stand out among the 5,000 new students once he entered the campus Belle selection. ”

“Ye Zao turned on his computer and said, “I’m not interested.” ”

Her computer turned on very quickly. Ye Zao pressed the shortcut key and logged into a website.

“Li Yueyue looked at the computer screen and could not help but ask, “Zao Zao, which version of your computer is it? Why don’t I recognize any of the words on it?” ”

“Ye Zao’s tone was indifferent. “Oh, this is the offshore Internet, c nation’s.” ”

“”Offshore Internet?”Li Yueyue said in surprise, “How did you log in?” ”

“”Climbing the wall,”ye Zao said simply. ”

“However, Li Yueyue was extremely surprised. ”

“One had to know that because it involved copyright issues, domestic websites could not wait to get into foreign websites. ”

How did ye Zao Switch so freely?

At this moment.

The door of the dormitory was pushed open from the outside.

Li Yueyue turned around to take a look.

It was Feng Xianxian.

“Because of the air-conditioning incident last time, Feng Xianxian and Bai Xiaoman disappeared for more than ten days. They did not even participate in military training. Li Yueyue thought that Feng Xianxian and Bai Xiaoman had dropped out of school. She did not expect that they would actually come back today. ”

“Seeing Li Yueyue, who had been slandered by a few degrees, Bai Xiaoman laughed out loud, she looked at Feng Xianxian and said, “Xianxian, it’s fortunate that your grandmother helped me to inform the school leader so that I don’t have to participate in the military training. Otherwise, I would definitely be like a certain someone, so dark that I wouldn’t even recognize my own mother! “Thank you so much!” ”

“Feng Xianxian looked at Li Yueyue, who was standing in front of ye Zao, with satisfaction. ”

“If even Li Yueyue had turned so dark, then ye Zao, who couldn’t even afford sunscreen, would probably be even darker, right? ”

“”Tanning is better than someone with a black heart, right?”Li Yueyue retorted directly. She lowered her head to look at Ye Zao. “Zao Zao, don’t you agree?” ”

Ye Zao’s tone was indifferent. “Yes.”

Only then did Feng Xianxian see ye Zao.

His brows were like a painting.

His skin was as white as jade.

Ye Zao.

Ye Zao was actually not tanned!

“Not only was he not tanned, he was even whiter than before. ”

What was going on?

Feng Xianxian’s expression instantly collapsed.

She originally wanted to come back and see ye Zao’s embarrassing tanned appearance.

She did not expect it!

She did not expect ye Zao to not be tanned at all.

What was going on?

“”Ye Zao, you did not participate in the military training either?”Feng Xianxian could not help but ask. ”

“Ye Zao continued to look at the computer, his fingers typing rapidly on the keyboard. “I’m sorry, I’m afraid I’ve disappointed you. I just don’t have a tanned physique.” ”

Feng Qianqian was so angry that she wanted to bite him.

She hadn’t seen the sun for ten days and it wasn’t even as white as ye Zao.

“Ye Zao was just a country bumpkin. Instead of having the life of a princess, he had the attributes of a princess. ”

It was really displeasing.

“At this moment, ye Zao’s phone rang. She picked up the phone with one hand and closed the computer screen with the other. She walked to the balcony to answer the phone. “Hello.” ”

Feng Qianqian narrowed her eyes. Could it be ye Zao’s deadbeat boyfriend?

“It seemed that not only was ye Zao’s boyfriend Deadbeat, he was also an unpresentable person. Otherwise, ye Zao wouldn’t have lost the courage to answer the phone in the dormitory and hide on the balcony to answer it! ”

...

Lin Ze had been busy deciphering the password of the safe these days.

“However, it had already been half a month, and there was still no progress. ”

“At this moment, the phone rang. ”

“Lin Ze immediately picked up the call. “Hello, How’s it going?” ”

An excited voice came from the other end. “I’ve already contacted the password deciphering expert from Thailand. Go online immediately and enter the room. Let’s talk to the expert face-to-face.”
