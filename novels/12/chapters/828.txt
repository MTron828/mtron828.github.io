“Chapter 829: 181: a man in the palm of his hand, a subordinate under his skirt! 3”

Translator: 549690339

“Lu Xiu looked at song Chenyu, hesitated for a moment, and then said, “Chenyu, is it really impossible between us?”Lu Xiu had waited for song Chenyu for so many years, and now he only wanted to wait for an answer from Song Chenyu.”

“Hearing this, the smile on song Chenyu’s face disappeared a little, and then he asked,”

“”Lu Xiu, what do you think is liking someone?””

“Lu Xiu replied, “Liking someone means being able to be with them. Chenyu, I want to be with you.””

“Song Chenyu shook his head and looked at Lu Xiu, “If you like someone, then be together. This is a selfish act. “I think that truly liking someone is looking at their happiness. “Lu Xiu, you can’t let your love become a burden to me. If you really like me, then you should keep this love in your heart. Finally, transform this love into protection and blessing!””

Lu Xiu’s love was too heavy for song Chenyu.

“In the television shows that song Chenyu had acted in, there were many two men and three men who were willing to sacrifice their lives for the female lead. They were willing to sacrifice everything for the female lead as long as the female lead could obtain happiness.”

“Therefore, in song Chenyu’s opinion, Lu Xiu should also become a supporting role to protect her and help her get everything she wanted.”

Lu Xiu was stunned.

Could it be that his love for Song Chenyu was a form of pressure?

“Song Chenyu continued, “Lu Xiu, think about it carefully. Am I Right?””

“Lu Xiu did not speak. His mind was filled with song Chenyu’s words, and his heart was in a mess.”

“After a while, Lu Xiu put down the cup and continued, “Chenyu, it’s getting late. I’ll go back first.””

“Okay.”Song Chenyu nodded and followed behind Lu Xiu to send him out.

“Looking at Lu Xiu’s back, song Chenyu continued, “Lu Xiu.””

“What’s Wrong?”Lu Xiu turned around.

“Song Chenyu continued, “Lu Xiu, I’m a female artiste. There are many times when I can’t follow my heart. I’m telling you this today not to make things difficult for you, but to let you know that I have my own difficulties. I hope that you can understand me.””

“Okay.”Lu Xiu nodded.

“After Lu Xiu left song Chenyu’s apartment, he sat alone in the car and pondered for a long time.”

He thought.

“Actually, song Chenyu was quite right.”

“If you like someone, you should want her to be happy.”

“Or perhaps, he was forcing song Chenyu too hard.”

“In the future, he would stand behind song Chenyu and protect her well. He would love her and shield her from all the storms. He could not let his love become a burden for song Chenyu.”

“Thinking of this, Lu Xiu picked up his phone and sent a message to song Chenyu.”

“[ Chenyu, I think I know what I should do. Don’t worry, I won’t do anything to make things difficult for you in the future. I will turn this love into protection and blessings. ]”

“When song Chenyu saw this message, the corners of her mouth curled up slightly. She went to the wine cabinet and poured herself a glass of red wine. Her fair fingers picked up the transparent goblet and shook it gently, the red liquid rippled in circles under the white light.”

This glass of wine was now in her hands.

So was Lu Xiu.

“One day, Cen Shaoqing would also become her subordinate and be in her hands.”

“Thinking of this, song Chenyu gulped down the glass of red wine in one gulp.”

...

On the other side.

In the office of a high-rise building.

“President Cao.”

“Seeing the person who came, Cao Wei put out the cigarette between his fingers in the ashtray. “Have you found the information?””

“No.”The secretary shook her head. “The identity of the live streamer that you asked me to check has been encrypted.”

“Encrypted?”Cao Wei frowned.

It was just a small live streamer. How could her identity be encrypted?

Could it be that there was some power behind her?

“Cao Wei continued, “Are you sure that her information is encrypted?””

“”Yes, I’m sure.”The secretary nodded.”

“Cao Wei continued, “Which company is she a live streamer from?””

“”She’s from world-conquering Culture Media Co. , Ltd. ,”the Secretary replied.”

“World-conquering?”Cao Wei narrowed his eyes.

He knew about this company.

“It was a new industry last year. In fact, at the beginning, he was not optimistic about this company. In this era of information development, all kinds of media companies sprouted like mushrooms after a rain.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Who knew that in the end, this company actually climbed up to the top 30 in the industry rankings. Now, it was firmly in the top three, and there was even a tendency for it to be ready.”

“After a while, Cao Wei looked up at his secretary. “Okay, I got it. You can go out first.””

“”Okay, president Cao, I’ll go out first.”The secretary turned around and walked out of the door.”

“Since the secretary could not find out who it was, Cao Wei could only think of another way.”
