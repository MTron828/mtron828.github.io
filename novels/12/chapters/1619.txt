Soon.

“Not only was the international section occupied, but the domestic social and news apps also began to broadcast the news. ”

On Weibo.

Ye Zhuo was listed on five hot searches.

# Dr. YC! #

# the launch ceremony of the aircraft carrier was held on May 18th #

# BET Agreement #

# Cen’s Base #

# an aircraft carrier that is faster than the speed of light! #

“I have been following the news of an aircraft carrier ever since it was first announced. I did not expect two years to pass so quickly! Is there anyone who knows about this? How is the completion of this aircraft plan coming along?”

“”I also wish for my country to become stronger. To be honest, when I saw the comments of those people on the international technology websites, I was really angry. But what can I do? Could YC really build an aircraft carrier that is faster than the speed of light?” ”

[ YC shouldn’t have signed this bet agreement! There’s nothing wrong with not owing the bet agreement. Signing the bet agreement is equivalent to handing over the management rights of the entire Cen’s base to someone else! ]

[ two years have passed too quickly! ]

“[ in the end, I can only blame this Dr. YC for being too arrogant. Did she really think that she could build an aircraft carrier just because she won first place in a certain science and technology competition? ]? It was one thing for her to say that she could build an aircraft carrier, but she even said that she could surpass the speed of light! Wasn’t this just a dream? This kind of person was not worthy of sympathy at all! ] ”

“[ yeah, I personally feel that if YC did not boast that she could surpass the speed of light, it might be easier to solve the problem. The biggest problem now is how to solve the speed of light! This is also her own fault! ] ”

[ I feel so embarrassed! ]

“[ same here, same here. I’m traveling outside now. When I say that I’m Chinese, they will chase me and ask me if YC is Chinese! ] ”

[ another world! I was just surrounded by people a few days ago! I’ve never been so embarrassed in my life. ]

“[ but when signing the betting agreement, someone should have come out to stop it. Now that it has happened, what’s the use of regretting it? ] ”

“[ how do you know that no one will stop it? ]? [ as far as I know, most of the elders of the CEN base have stood up to oppose it. Unfortunately, their arms can’t twist over their thighs. The management rights of the CEN base are all in the hands of Fifth Master Cen. As long as fifth master CEN supports YC, even if those elders don’t agree, what can they do? ] ”

“[ sigh! Fifth Master Cen, just wait to regret it! Love really corrupts people. Fifth Master Cen used to be a smart person. I didn’t expect that he would listen to such nonsense! ] ”

“[ it’s not enough that YC has humiliated her own people, but now she wants to humiliate our Chinese people! ] ”

[ I’m so angry! Our Chinese face has been completely humiliated just like that! ]

[ this YC really has a bad reputation for ten thousand years! ]

“[ it’s fine that YC has a bad reputation for ten thousand years, but the most important thing is that she has also damaged the reputation of Dr. Millet, Dr. Warne, and the Feiyu Team! ] ”

“It must be known that when ye Zhuo announced the establishment of the aircraft carrier project team, Dr. Millet, Dr. Warne, and the Feiyu team, the three forces, did not hesitate to support ye Zhuo. ”

“Now that it had come to this, the reputation of Dr. Millet, Dr. Warne, and the Feiyu team would also be damaged! ”

“When she saw the words ‘go down in history in history in history’, Tang Xue clicked ‘like’below. ”

Wasn’t a person like Ye Zhuo the eternal bad?

“”Miss Tang.”At this moment, there was a knock on the door again. ”

“Come in.”Tang Xue raised her head.

“”Miss Tang, I’m sorry to disturb you.”The assistant walked in from outside the door. “Just now, Miss Ye sent someone to say that your analysis report is not up to standard. You have one hour to correct it before sending it to her!” ”

“What’s Wrong?”Tang Xue frowned.

“The assistant shook his head. “I’m not too sure about the specifics, but Miss Ye’s secretary said that Miss ye pointed out all the mistakes.” ”

Tang Xue’s expression did not look good. “I got it. You can go out first.”

The assistant walked out.

“Just as the assistant left, Tang Xue picked up the cup on the bracelet and smashed it on the ground. ”

She saw that ye Zao did it on purpose!

“He was deliberately making things difficult for her, making her change it again and again. ” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Once or twice.

Just wait.

Ye Zao couldn’t be complacent for long.

She wanted to see how ye Zao would still be able to smile on May 18th!

She would return all the cowardice that she had received from ye Zao these days to ye Zao!

And she would return it to Ye Zao with double the amount!
