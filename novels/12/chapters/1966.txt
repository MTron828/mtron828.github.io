“Chapter 1967: 413: he ziteng recovers, shredding Xu Yao and Mi Chen (21st watch!)1”

Translator: 549690339

“Seeing this scene, Mi Chen thought she was hallucinating. ”

Why was the director so respectful to Ye Ziteng?

That’s right.

“Ye Ziteng was pretty and had a great temperament. However, no matter how pretty she was or how great her temperament was, she was just a woman. ”

“Yun Jianguo was the director of the Third People’s Hospital. He was a high-ranking official with a powerful background. Usually, some nobles would not be able to curry favor with him even if they wanted to. ”

But now...

“Before Mi Chen could react, ye Zao said calmly, “Director Yun, arrange an operating room for me. I want to operate on he ziteng immediately.” ”

“”Sure.”Yun Jianguo nodded and continued, “I’ll arrange it right away.” ”

“Can you do it in fifteen minutes?”Ye Zao asked.

“No problem.”

“Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “Then I’ll leave everything to you, director Yun.” ”

“”Of course,”Yun Jianguo said with some trepidation. ”

“The director sent someone to arrange the surgery, while Ye Zhuo began to prepare for the pre-operation work. ”

“This surgery only had a 50% success rate. There was a high possibility that he ziteng would die on the operating table, so the he family’s parents had to sign the consent form. ”

Only with their consent could the surgery be carried out.

Seeing that all the work was being carried out nervously.

“Xu Yao pinched her fingers, feeling a little anxious. ”

“She did not know why, but she had a bad feeling in her heart. She felt that ye Zhuo could cure he ziteng. ”

What if he ziteng really recovered?

No.

She could not let such a thing happen.

“Seeing that the he family’s parents were about to sign the consent form, Xu Yao said, “You can’t Sign It!” ”

“Hearing Xu Yao’s voice, he ziteng, who was lying on the bed, wanted nothing more than to get up immediately and tear her face apart. ”

What was this B * Tch trying to do?

Was she trying to stop ye Zao from performing the surgery on him? !

That was true.

“As long as he died, Xu Yao could use her stomach to enter the house. ”

Xu Yao wished that she was dead right away.

Why would she let ye Zhuo save him?

What should they do now?

He ziteng was very anxious.

He hoped that his parents would be able to see through Xu Yao’s true colors as soon as possible.

“Hearing this, father he’s hand that was signing the papers stopped. He turned around and looked at Xu Yao. “What’s wrong, Yaoyao?” ”

“Xu Yao sorted out the expression on her face and continued, “Uncle and Auntie, come out for a moment. I have something to tell you.” ”

“”I’ll sign the papers first,”father he said. ”

“”No, wait until I’m done talking to you. You can consider whether you want to sign it or not.” ”

“The He family’s parents looked at each other and saw the doubt in each other’s eyes. Then, they followed Xu Yao out of the door. ”

“”Yaoyao, what do you want to tell us?”Mother he asked. ”

“Xu Yao continued, “Uncle and Auntie, don’t you think that Miss Ye is too young?” ”

“Mother he nodded. “Miss ye is indeed very young. However, although she is young, she has the ability. The mother of our country’s first aircraft carrier is Miss Ye!” ”

Age did not equate to strength.

Xu Yao narrowed her eyes.

She had only heard of the name Miss ye from he ziteng. She did not know that ye Zao’s background was so great!

“This way, she could not let ye Zao perform the surgery on he ziteng! ”

Because ye Zao was too powerful.

“Xu Yao continued to speak, “Miss Ye is a scientific researcher. Scientific Research and medical skills are two completely unrelated professions. Moreover, Miss Ye has also said that she only has a 50% chance of success. What if the surgery fails?” ”

“Hearing this, mother he was stunned. ”

“Father he continued to speak, “If we let miss ye try, there’s at least a 50% chance of success. But if we don’t let Miss Ye Try, then there’s no chance at all! “Do we have to watch helplessly as Ziteng lies on the bed for the rest of his life and can’t Do Anything?” ” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“As parents, they could not bear to see their son like this. ”

“Even if there was only a 1% chance, they had to save him. ”

“Xu Yao frowned slightly, “Uncle, Auntie, you guys are thinking too simply about this! If the surgery fails, we will never be able to see Ziteng again! Now, we can at least see Ziteng every day and guard him! No matter what, it’s better to be alive than dead!” ”

“Hearing this, mother he was stunned. ”

“Actually, what Xu Yao said was not unreasonable. ”

“Father he said, “Yaoyao, I understand your feelings, but I have to give it a try now. Take a gamble! What if Ziteng recovers? Are you sure the surgery will fail?” ”

Xu Yao shook her head. “I didn’t mean that. I’m just worried about Ziteng!”

“Mother he smiled and said, “Yaoyao, I know you didn’t mean that. Ziteng used to trust miss ye very much. I believe that if ziteng were sober now, he would definitely agree to let miss ye treat him.” ”
