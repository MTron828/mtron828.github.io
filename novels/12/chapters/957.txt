“Chapter 958: 219: Cen Yuyan finally came to her senses. Dog Bites Dog, a mouthful of fur! 1”

Translator: 549690339

Was this Zhou Rui’s voice?

Cen Yuyan’s tears flowed down almost instantly.

They surged forward.

One couldn’t tell from Zhou Rui’s words that he and song Chenyu had known each other since a long time ago.

Her acquaintance with Zhou Rui was also a conspiracy.

No.

Cen Yuyan didn’t believe it was true.

Cen Yuyan tried her best to force back her tears. She took a deep breath and continued to listen to the conversation in the room.

Zhou Rui was very angry.

Very angry.

“Back then, he had listened to song Chenyu’s words and got together with CEN Yuyan. He had spent so much time with Cen Yuyan, but now? ”

“Not only did he not become the son-in-law of the Cen family as he wished, but Cen Yuyan had even pestered him. ”

“It would have been fine if Cen Yuyan was a young and beautiful woman, but Cen Yuyan was an old woman who could have anything she wanted. ”

“During this period of time, song Chenyu had already given Zhou Rui nearly 20 million. She was not Cen Yuyan, but she could easily get 10 million. A celebrity’s job looked glamorous, but the money came quickly.., in fact, she did not earn as much as outsiders thought. ”

“If she had to pay taxes, she had to split it equally with the management company. How much would she have left in her hands? ”

“In addition to Zhou Rui being like a bottomless pit, song Chenyu was also mentally and physically exhausted. ”

“Song Chenyu sighed, “Zhou Rui, I understand your current mood, but please be patient. It’s only four months now. Maybe when your child is born, the Cen family will take her back! “No matter what, Cen Yuyan is the Cen family’s fourth young miss. No matter what, the CEN family will not let Cen Yuyan Go!” ”

Blood ties were not something that could be severed just like that.

“As long as Cen Yuyan was still alive, she was the Cen family’s unique fourth young miss. ”

No one could replace Cen Yuyan’s position.

Cen Yuyan was just suspecting that song Chenyu and Zhou Rui had known each other for a long time.

Now...

“Through these words, she had basically confirmed that these two people knew each other. ”

No...

They wouldn’t.

“Zhou Rui loved her so much, and song Chenyu was her best sister. ”

How could they betray her.

There was a mistake.

There must be a mistake.

The people who were talking in the living room were definitely not song Chenyu and Zhou Rui.

Cen Yuyan gently pushed the cabinet door open a crack.

She saw the two people in the room.

Those two people.

One was the person she slept with.

The other was a good sister who helped her solve her problems.

That’s right.

It was them.

It was really them.

“Cen Yuyan covered her mouth, her eyes filled with disbelief. ”

Her entire heart felt like it was being cut by a knife.

It was so painful that it tore her heart apart.

Song Chenyu and Zhou Rui did not notice the pair of eyes behind the cabinet door.

“Zhou Rui looked at song Chenyu like this, “Think about how many times you’ve said this! Back then, you said that the CEN family would recognize that old woman after she and I got our marriage certificate! Now, you’re saying that you want to wait until the child is born. After that child is born, are you saying that you want to wait until the child grows up to marry and have children?” ”

Zhou Rui couldn’t wait any longer.

He really could not wait any longer.

He believed that anyone would break down in the face of Cen Yuyan’s ugly face.

“Cen Yuyan was not only very ugly. Ever since she became pregnant, her entire person had become even more pretentious. It was still alright for Zhou Rui to coax a young and beautiful girl. ”

But what was the point of having Zhou Rui coax an old woman like Cen Yuyan?

“Looking at Cen Yuyan’s face, he already felt disgusted, let alone coax her. ”

“Song Chenyu continued, “I want the Cen family to recognize Cen Yuyan more than you do. I’m not Cen Yuyan. I don’t have any backers behind me. If you keep asking me for money like a bottomless pit, I’ll break down too! “Believe me, wait a little longer. The Cen family will recognize Cen Yuyan one day. When that time comes, you’ll be the Cen family’s fourth son-in-law. The Sun will always shine after the storm. When you become the CEN family’s fourth son-in-law, do you have anything you want?” ”

Song Chenyu’s words were sincere.

Only when Cen Yuyan was recognized by the CEN family would she be able to completely get rid of Zhou Rui.

“Hearing these words, Zhou Rui slowly calmed down. “Then I will endure it!”For his bright future and for the Zhou family’s position in the capital, he had to endure it. ”

Song Chenyu was right. The Sun would always shine after the storm.

“I heard Cen Yuyan say that you’ve been staying out all night?”

Zhou Rui loosened his tie in annoyance. “Who’s willing to look at her ugly face all the time?”

Song Chenyu was unwilling to say more. “Keep your hands and feet clean. Just don’t let her discover anything at a time like this.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“”So what if she finds out?”Zhou Rui said disdainfully, “What else can a fool like her do? Didn’t she also find out about you and Lu Xiu last time? What happened in the end? If you ask me, she’s really stupid! She was actually fooled by you to this extent!” ”
