“Bai Mo smiled and said, “Sister, why are you saying thank you? We’re all family! “Actually, while I’m helping you, I’m also helping myself. A few days ago, I heard my parents discussing my marriage. I don’t want to marry someone I don’t like. Now that you’ve encountered such a situation, of course I can’t just sit idly by.” ”

“They shared the same fate, so Bai Jingshu had a better impression of Bai Mo. . ”

She felt that this sister of hers wasn’t as bad as she had imagined.

“Soon, they arrived at the residence of the second son of the Bai family. ”

“Bai Mo looked at Bai Jingshu and continued, “Sis, don’t worry. My parents aren’t at home. No one will notice us.” ”

“Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded.

“Bai Mo brought Bai Jingshu to the basement. “SIS, this is my interstellar shuttle. I’ll lend it to you now.” ”

“Bai Mo’s interstellar shuttle was a gift from her father. Because it was rarely used, it still looked like a new one. ”

“”Sis, this is the key.”Bai Mo handed the key to Bai Jingshu. ”

“Bai Jingshu reached out and took it. “Mo Mo, have you thought it through? Are you really going to lend me the Interstellar Shuttle?” ”

“Yes.”Bai Mo nodded in acknowledgment.

“Bai Jingshu continued, “I might need a long time to return to Earth this time. What if you suddenly need to use the interstellar shuttle?” ”

“”It’s okay, sis. If I want to use it, I’ll think of a way myself. Hurry up and leave! Otherwise, if uncle and aunt come looking for you, you won’t be able to leave!” ”

“”Alright.”Bai Jingshu nodded. “Then I’ll be leaving. Momo, take good care of yourself.” ”

“”SIS, have a safe journey.” ”

“Soon, the interstellar shuttle entered the quantum world. ”

“Bai Mo stood where she was, a triumphant smile on her face. ” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Through this time, Bai Jingshu would definitely trust her. ”

“Man Wen and Bai Jingshu were very close friends. As long as she had Bai Jingshu in her grasp, man Wen’s impression of her would not be too bad. ”

On the other side.

“After a few days of focused investigation, Lin Ze finally found some clues. ”

The Yuan dynasty record was indeed taken by someone using high-tech means.

“Through layers of decryption, he finally caught the thief’s figure under the camera. ”

It was a male.

He looked about 27 or 28 years old and looked ordinary.

“Although he did not know who the other party was, the only thing he could confirm was that the other party was from an alien planet. ”

Lin Ze immediately locked onto his target and started to search for him.

“However, the Heavenly Eye didn’t cover the entire road. When he was on a small path, there was no trace of him at all. ”

Lin Ze had no choice but to climb up the wall and attack the heavenly eye system in the s galaxy.

He searched for a long time.

“Finally, he found a piece of useful information. ”

“Chen Yaosheng, male, 26 years old. ”

“Chen Jinyan, second son of the Chen family. ”

Lin Ze looked at Chen Yaosheng’s information and frowned slightly. He did not understand why Chen Yaosheng was interested in this Yuan dynasty record.

“Since Chen Yaosheng had been to Earth, he would definitely appear on Earth again. ”

He must catch this book thief with his own hands!

Lin Ze narrowed his eyes.

“At this moment, Lin Ze received a message. ”

“After receiving this message, Lin Ze immediately went to the CEN base and boarded the interstellar shuttle. Destination: F Galaxy! ”

F galaxy.

Shangguan residence.

“Old Lady Shangguan lay on her bed and kept asking, “Is ah ze here?” ”

“”Not yet, old lady. Please wait a little longer. I’m already contacting Mr. Lin,”the servant said. ”

“Ten years ago, Old Lady Shangguan’s only grandson passed away, taking away all of her expectations. ”

“Last week, the old lady fainted on the way to her grandson’s grave. At this time, she was saved by a passing youth. ”

“When the old lady woke up, she was surprised to find that the youth was somewhat similar to her deceased grandson. Furthermore, there was a small red mole on the same spot between their brows. ”

“Although she knew that this youth could not be her deceased grandson, the old lady was still overjoyed and thought that her grandson had returned in another way. ”

The Shangguan family was the number one family in Gardenia in Galaxy F.

It was equivalent to the presidents of other planets.

“All these years, Old Lady Shangguan had been managing gardenia. ”

She thought that she would have no successor.

Until Lin Ze’s appearance.

“Lin Ze’s appearance gave Old Lady Shangguan Hope and light, and also gave her spirit a place to rest. ”

Very soon.

Such rumors spread from all the major galaxies.

Old Lady Shangguan of the Yuan and Ming kingdoms actually wanted to pass on the position of heir to an unrelated outsider.
