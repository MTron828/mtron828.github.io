“An hour later, ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing walked out of the teahouse. ”

* *

Time passed very quickly.

“In the blink of an eye, the next day arrived. ”

Today was the third day of cooperation between Ye Zhuo and Shunxi Financial Group.

“Jiang Chao originally thought that after cooperating with Ye Zhuo, the Jiang Financial Group would definitely come back to life. ”

“However, he didn’t expect that after using ye Zhuo’s plan, not only would the financial group not come back to life, but they would also lose all the funds invested over the past few days! ”

The shares of the Jiang Consortium fell again and again.

Jiang Chao was extremely anxious.

“The shareholders of the Jiang Consortium couldn’t sit still any longer, and they all shouted that they wanted to withdraw their funds. ”

“Jiang Chao immediately contacted ye Zhuo and dialed her office landline. “Hello, is this President Ye?” ”

“”President Ye isn’t here right now. I’m her secretary, Millet. If there’s anything, just tell me.”Millet’s voice came from the other end of the phone. ”

“Jiang Chao told Millet the whole story. “When President Ye comes back, ask her to give me a call.” ”

“Okay.”Millet said.

Millet had just hung up the phone when ye Zhuo walked in from outside. Millet immediately reported the situation to Ye Zhuo. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Hearing this, Ye Zhuo’s expression was indifferent as if he didn’t take this matter to heart. “Okay, I got it. You can go out first.” ”

“Alright.”Milai nodded.

“Ye Zhuo returned the call to Jiang Chao. “Uncle Jiang, is it?” ”

“Hearing Ye Zhuo’s voice, Jiang Chao seemed to have suddenly found his backbone. “President Ye!” ”

“I heard that some of the old shareholders are withdrawing their capital?”Ye Zhuo continued to ask.

“”Yes.”Jiang Chao said, “President Ye, what should we do now?” ”

“Ask them to withdraw.”

Ask them to withdraw?

“Jiang Chao paused for a moment and said, “President Ye, are... Are You Sure?”Almost half of the shareholders wanted to withdraw their capital. The consortium was an empty shell to begin with, and this move would very likely affect the DAO Shunxi consortium. ”

“En.”

Jiang Chao asked again with some uncertainty.

“Ye Zhuo’s voice then came from the microphone, “Do as I say. If anything happens, I’ll take responsibility.” ”

“His tone was faint, but it had a penetrating power that was tinged with a biting cold. ”

“After saying that, Ye Zao hung up the phone. ”

“A moment later, ye Zao dialed the Secretary’s internal line again. “Ally, inform all the executives who are participating in the Jiang Financial Group’s plan to come to the 58th floor for a meeting in 10 minutes!” ”

“”Yes, President Ye.” ”

Zhao Xueyin’s office.

“Miss Zhao!”

Annie hurriedly walked in from outside.

“What’s Wrong?”Zhao Xueyin looked up

“Annie continued, “Something big happened over at President Ye’s side!” ”

Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes. “What do you mean?”

“”It’s about the Jiang Financial Group!”Annie said, “I heard from millet that there’s a loophole in President Ye’s plan. He’s holding an emergency meeting right now! He’s calling all the higher-ups who participated in the Jiang Financial Group over!” ”

“Is that so?”

“Annie nodded, “Millet said that this matter is very troublesome. The Jiang Financial Group has already withdrawn a large number of old shareholders. President ye is currently thinking of a way to remedy it!” ”

“Just wait.”Zhao Xueyin looked up at the window. The corners of her mouth were full of ridicule. “The good show is yet to come!”

Remedy?

How?

How could someone like Ye Zhuo save the Jiang Financial Group?

It was simply impossible!

This was just the beginning.

“In the blink of an eye, another day had passed. ”

“The next morning, Zhao Xueyin had just arrived at her office when Annie rushed up to her. “Miss Zhao! President ye is waiting for you in the Office!” ”

Ye Zhuo was waiting for her in the office?

Zhao Xueyin’s lips curled up slightly.

She knew that ye Zhuo would definitely come and beg her personally.

But she did not expect that this day would come so quickly.
