Xiao Tian arrived at the meeting place he had arranged with Chen Siyao.

Xiao Tian arrived half an hour early. He thought that Chen Siyao wouldn’t be here by the time he arrived.

He didn’t expect to see Chen Siyao waving at him as soon as he entered the cafe.

Xiao Tian thought he was hallucinating and immediately jogged over. “Sister Yao!”

Chen Siyao smiled. “I’ve already ordered some coffee for you.”

“”Thank you, sister Yao,”Xiao Tian said. ”

Chen Siyao picked up a silver spoon and stirred the coffee in her cup. “You’re welcome.”

“Xiao Tian took a sip of his coffee and asked, “By the way, May I know why you’re Looking For me, Sister Yao?” ”

“Under normal circumstances, Chen Siyao was looking for him because of Song Shiyu. ”

This time was no exception.

“Chen Siyao continued, “I want to know if your boss song has been in contact with any girls recently?” ”

She really guessed right.

“Girls?”Xiao Tian asked.

“Yes.”Chen Siyao was eager to know what the person song Shiyu liked looked like.

“Chen Siyao wanted to get to know her, get close to her, and learn from her. ”

Someone who could catch song Shiyu’s eye would definitely be very good-looking.

“Xiao Tian thought for a moment and then said, “No, the boss has always been very regular in his daily life. And as you know, he doesn’t like to interact with women.” ”

Song Shiyu’s personality was a little strange.

“Other bosses had red flags at home that didn’t fall down, colorful flags floating outside, and all sorts of mistresses, but Song Shiyu was different. The only woman by his side was Chen Siyao. ”

“However, Little Tian also knew that song Shiyu didn’t like Chen Siyao. ”

“Hearing this, Chen Siyao frowned slightly. “Little Tian, I hope you can tell me the truth.” ”

“With that, Chen siyao continued, “As long as you tell me the truth, I can give you anything you want.” ”

Chen Siyao didn’t believe what little Tian said. She thought that little tian was lying to her.

“Little Tian said, “Sister Yao, I really didn’t lie to you.” ”

He was song Shiyu’s personal assistant. He knew all the people song Shiyu met and the women he had met.

“”You know boss’s personality, sister Yao.”At this point, little tian paused and continued, “There was a celebrity who wanted to marry boss, but boss rejected him.” ”

Chen Siyao also knew about that celebrity.

“She was a popular person in the industry and had countless suitors, but just like Chen Siyao, she couldn’t help but fall in love with song Shiyu. ”

“Really?”Chen Siyao continued to ask.

Xiao Tian nodded. “Really.”

“Chen Siyao thought about it and changed her approach. She continued to ask, “Then has your boss been paying special attention to any girls recently?” ”

“”No.”Xiao Tian shook his head. “If the boss is really paying attention to someone, there’s no way I wouldn’t know.” ”

“If song Shiyu really had someone that he was paying special attention to, the other party probably would have pounced on him before song Shiyu could say anything. ”

But he didn’t.

“”The boss’s schedule hasn’t been very full recently, and he hasn’t seen many partners,”Xiao Tian added. ”

“Hearing this, Chen Siyao narrowed her eyes. Her eyes were filled with confusion. After a moment, she looked up at little tian and asked, “Little Tian, did your boss ask you to look up any information about any girls?” ”

“After receiving this, Chen Siyao added, “Don’t deny it yet. I can guarantee you with my personality that I won’t say anything. You Don’t have to worry that your boss will find out.” ”

“”Sister Yao, I can promise you that I’m not lying. I really haven’t seen my boss pay attention to anyone of the opposite sex,”Xiao Tian said seriously. ”

“Of course, Chen Siyao didn’t believe him. ”

“After all, Xiao Tian was song Shiyu’s personal assistant. ”

“”Xiao Tian, we’ve known each other for so many years,”Chen Siyao continued. “I’m sure you know what I mean to your boss. I don’t have any other intentions. I just want to know what kind of girl your boss loves but can’t get her head around looks like.” ”

Perhaps she would give up after just meeting her.

“Otherwise, Chen Siyao would never give up. Not only would she never give up, she would also be very unwilling. ”

“Fall in love with her but not get her?”Xiaotian looked at Chen Siyao in shock. He couldn’t believe that song Shiyu had someone he couldn’t fall in love with.

How was that possible!

Who Was Song Shiyu?

The big shot of big shots. What kind of girl could reject song Shiyu?

It was too scary!

“Looking at Xiaotian’s reaction, Chen Siyao was stunned. ”
