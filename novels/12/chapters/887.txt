Translator: 549690339

“At this moment, Song Chenyu was really panicking. ”

She did not expect things to turn out this way.

Ye Zao actually got a clear video.

“Song Chenyu had clearly seen the video equipment at the scene, and the camera crew could not capture the process at all. ”

So...

Where did ye Zao get the recording?

“At this moment, an image flashed through song Chenyu’s mind. ”

“When Ye Zao was talking to her, he subconsciously touched the second button on his shirt. ”

Could it be that the camera was on that button?

“If the camera was really on the button, then ye Zao was too scary. ”

Song Chenyu’s face became paler and paler.

She couldn’t even hear what brother Tao was saying on the phone.

“”Hello, Chenyu, are you listening?” ”

“Chenyu!”

“Chenyu!”

“Just as brother Tao shouted for the third time, Song Chenyu finally reacted. “Brother Tao, I’m listening.” ”

“Brother Tao continued, “Chenyu, immediately post an apology to ye Zao on Weibo and push all the blame onto song Yiwan!” ”

“Fortunately, song Chenyu had said on her previous Weibo that she did not remember what had happened. ” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“As long as she posted an apology to clarify the situation, then asked the public relations department to comment on it and post a press release, the matter would be over after a long time. ”

“Although this matter still affected song Chenyu, it could at least reduce the loss in this kind of crisis. ”

“In the current situation, apologizing was song Chenyu’s best choice. ”

Apologize?

But song Chenyu did not want to apologize.

Ask her to apologize to ye Zao?

And in front of all the fans online.

On what basis?

“Is there no other way except to apologize?”Song Chenyu only spoke after a long while.

“”Chenyu, in my eyes, you’ve always been a smart and sensible artist. You have to apologize for this matter,”brother Tao continued, “Isn’t it just an apology? “It’s not a big deal. What if ye Zao falls into your hands one day?” ”

Song Chenyu was very unwilling.

She thought that she could successfully take down ye Zao this time.

She did not expect ye Zao to be so sinister and cunning!

She was too careless...

Just wait.

She had to take revenge.

The viciousness in song Chenyu’s eyes was almost overflowing.

“”Brother Tao, I’ll listen to you.” ”

“Brother Tao was a little worried about song Chenyu’s condition, so he continued, “I’ll get editor Xiao Li to send the Weibo document to your wechat. Don’t send it for now.” ”

“Okay.”

Song Chenyu had just hung up when the door to the ward was pushed open.

Song Chenyu turned around and saw that it was Cen Yuyan.

“”Yuyan, why are you here?” ”

“After Cen Yuyan heard about song Chenyu’s matter, she rushed over in a hurry. When she saw song Chenyu sitting on the hospital bed with tears all over his face and a bandage on his head, CEN Yuyan’s heart ached terribly. “Chenyu, are you alright?” ”

“I’m fine.”Song Chenyu shook his head.

“Cen Yuyan frowned and said, “You’re still saying that you’re fine even though it’s already like this! I’ve Long said that Ye Zhuo isn’t an ordinary person! Look, something happened right now! I think she did it on purpose! She was jealous of your beauty and deliberately wanted to disfigure you!” ”

“Song Chenyu said with a pale face, “This matter has nothing to do with Miss Ye. I was the one who accidentally fell into the ditch.” ”

“”Chenyu, you’re just too kind-hearted.”Cen Yuyan continued, “Back then, you should have refused to film that variety show with ye Zao! I don’t know what’s going on with Shaoqing that he actually took a fancy to such a thing! If it wasn’t for Shaoqing’s sake, I would have long gone over to slap her!” ”

“In the end, this matter was all old Lady Cen’s fault. ”

“If it wasn’t for Old Lady Cen, Cen Shaoqing wouldn’t have chosen to be with ye Zao. ”

“What a piece of rat poop, spoiling a pot of porridge! ”

No one knew when Cen Shaoqing would come to his senses.

“”Yuyan, don’t say that.”Song Chenyu pulled Cen Yuyan’s hand. “This matter is indeed not miss ye’s fault. It’s all my own fault.” ”

Cen Yuyan became even angrier when she saw song Chenyu enduring such humiliation.

“At this moment, Song Chenyu received a wechat message from his assistant, Xiao Li. ”

Song Chenyu picked up and posted on Weibo.

“”Chenyu, what are you doing?”Cen Yuyan asked. ”

“”I’m sending an apology Weibo to Miss Ye,”song Chenyu replied. ”

“Apology?”Cen Yuyan directly stood up from her chair. “You mean to apologize to Ye Zhuo?”

Song Chenyu nodded.

“”On what basis! ?”Cen Yuyan said angrily, “Can she afford to apologize to ye Zao?” ”
