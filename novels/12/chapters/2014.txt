“A moment later, ye Zao put away his communication device. ”

“”It’s nothing.”After saying that, he continued, “Let’s go first.” ”

“”Okay.”Yi Ling nodded and said with some worry, “What about Li Zi Yue and the others? If ye Lan makes trouble again...” ”

Anyone with discerning eyes could see that ye Lan really had the intention to kill.

“If ye Lan had not arrived in time, Li Zi Yue and the others would have already been silenced. ”

What if ye Lan were to cause trouble for Li Zi Yue after Ye Zhuo left?

“”Don’t worry. With Qiu di around, Ye Lan wouldn’t dare.”Ye Zhuo’s tone was indifferent. ”

“Qiu Di?”Yi Ling did not quite understand the meaning of these words. “Could it be that Qiu Di isn’t with Ye Lan and the others?”

Would autumn flute read for Li Zi?

“No matter how she looked at it, it seemed impossible. ”

Ye Zao sat in the driver’s seat. “Autumn flute wants to watch us kill each other.”

Ye Zao’s real enemy was never autumn flute.

It was the person standing behind autumn flute.

“Autumn flute thought that she could sit in the position of the female sovereign. In fact, she was just a pawn in the hands of the Great Witch Doctor and the others. ”

“If ye Zao’s opponent was only Qiu Di, she wouldn’t have to go through so much trouble. ”

She did this to find out who was hiding behind Qiu Di.

Yi Ling understood very well and nodded. “Then where are we going now?”

“”We’re going to Grandma Fei’s place,”ye Zao answered. ”

“OH.”

“The flying machine was very fast. In about ten minutes, the flying machine stopped in front of a building. ”

An old man with white hair was sitting on a recliner in front of the balcony.

“A chubby kitten was lying in her arms. Hearing the footsteps, the kitten stretched and meowed. It looked at the person curiously. ”

“Grandma Fei.”Ye Zhuo walked over.

“Hearing this, Grandma Fei opened her eyes. “Who’s Here?” ”

“It’s me.”Ye Zhuo put the pastries on the coffee table. “Joey.”

“”Joey?”Grandma Fei Thought for a moment, and then seemed to have thought of something. She smiled and said, “I know you! You are the little girl that followed Zao Zao, right?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded. “I came to see you.”

“Grandma Fei stood up and looked left and right at Ye Zao. Finally, she said, “Where is Zao Zao? Didn’t he come with you?” ”

Everyone in Chang Yue knew that ye Zao had died.

But this kind-looking old lady seemed to know nothing about this matter.

“Ye Zao continued, “She has been very busy recently, so she asked me to come and see you.” ”

“”OH.”Grandmother Fei nodded and smiled. “That child is good in everything, but she’s too busy! We don’t see her many times a year.” ”

Grandma Fei and the Grandma who adopted ye Zao were biological sisters.

Unfortunately.

Grandma Ye was not as lucky as Grandma Fei.

Grandma ye passed away when Ye Zao was fifteen. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Although Grandma Fei had her own children, ye Zao still treated Grandma Fei as his own grandmother. He gave Grandma Fei and her family the best life and let her spend her old age peacefully. ”

“Grandma Fei stood up from the chair and grabbed ye Zhuo’s hand. “Little Miss Joey, it’s so hard for you to come to see an old woman like me!” ”

“”It’s my duty,”ye Zhuo said. ”

“Grandma Fei sighed and continued, “Unfortunately, my older sister left early. I’m enjoying her blessings now. If she were here, sigh, let’s not talk about it...” ”

“After saying that, grandma FEI said again, “Oh right, why haven’t I Seen Ye Han?” ”

“Although ye Zhuo didn’t come often, ye Han would come to visit Grandma Fei whenever he was free. ”

It had been a long time since ye Han came to visit Grandma Fei!

Ye Zhuo’s expression didn’t change. “There’s something wrong with Ye Han’s body.”

“Grandma Fei frowned, “Is Ye Han Okay?”? “I don’t know who was the one who made up that something happened to Zao Zao the last time, but it scared little ye Han quite a bit! “I’ve never seen Little Ye Han Like That! “At that time, I told him that Zao Zao was so powerful, so how could anything happen to her! “But little ye Han didn’t believe me! “He ran away before I could finish my words! “Young people are fickle and impetuous. They don’t know how to learn from Zao Zao!” ”

“”Don’t worry, Ye Han is fine.”Ye Zao held Grandma Fei’s hand. “After everything has settled down, Miss Ye will bring him to see you.” ”

“”Okay.”Grandma Fei nodded with a smile. “I like Little Ye Han the most. Oh right, Little Ye Han doesn’t have a girlfriend yet, right?” ”

“”No,”ye Zao said. ”

“Grandma Fei said, “Then I’ll introduce him to a girlfriend. He’s already so big, how can he not have a girlfriend!” ”
