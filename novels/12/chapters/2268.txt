“Although the Cheng family looked down on the Bai family’s daughter, under the current circumstances, they could only let Bai Jingshu marry Chen Yaosheng! ”

“Bai Jiacheng smiled and said, “Master Chen is a straightforward person. However, marriage is a big matter. As parents, we have to ask for the child’s opinion. We can not easily promise.” ”

Bai Jiacheng had never been a father who respected his daughter. The reason he said that was to make things difficult for the Chen family.

“After all, the Bai family had always been the ones who lowered themselves in front of the Chen family. Now, it was finally the Bai family’s turn to be proud! ”

“As long as he did not nod his head, Chen Yaosheng would not be able to stand out for the rest of his life. ” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Madam Chen was really angry. She clenched her fists tightly, and because she had used too much strength, they had already turned slightly white. ”

The Bai family was really a nest of snakes and rats!

“The old and the old had taken advantage of the situation, while the young had no sense of shame at all. Apart from seducing men, they were completely useless! ”

“If Chen Yaosheng had not been set up by Bai Jingshu, how would he have become like this? ”

“As a mother, no one knew her child better than she did. Chen Yaosheng was a very sensible son. He would never do something that did not know his limits. ”

Not to mention attempted rape and attempted murder!

It was obvious that Bai Jingshu had set Chen Yaosheng up.

Just wait.

“When Bai Jingshu married into the Chen family, she would definitely make Bai Jingshu regret it! ”

“Chen jinyan nodded and continued, “Mr. Bai is right. We still need to ask for the child’s opinion on such a big matter. Then I’ll wait for the good news and wait for Mr. Bai’s Good News!” ”

“At the end of his speech, Chen Jinyan stood up from his chair and said, “Mr. Bai, we’ll take our leave first.” ”

Bai Jiasheng also stood up to send Chen Jinyan off.

“After sending Chen Jinyan and his wife out of the door, Zhou Ying looked at Bai Jiasheng and said in disbelief, “I really didn’t expect our Jingshu to have such a great ability!” ”

That was a whole three boxes of star energy!

“With those three boxes of star energy, the Bai family would be rich. ”

“”I didn’t expect that girl to be so quiet that she would be so aggressive!”Bai jiasheng continued, “Quickly contact her and tell her to come back for dinner tonight.” ”

“Okay.”

“When Bai Jingshu received Zhou Ying’s call, she didn’t want to go back, but Zhou Ying lowered her voice and apologized to Bai Jingshu, saying that she was wrong last time. ”

“No matter what, Zhou Ying was still her mother, so after much thought, Bai Jingshu still came back. ”

The Bai family’s brothers and sisters were all gathered tonight.

“Bai Jingshu had two younger brothers named Bai Liwen and Bai Liwu, and one younger sister named Bai Jingfei. ”

“Bai Jingfei had already learned about Bai Jingshu from her mother. As soon as Bai Jingshu returned, she said in a somewhat sarcastic tone, “Some people might look like they don’t fight over anything, but in fact, they have more tricks up their sleeves than anyone else!” ”

“In the Bai family, who was more Buddhist than Bai Jingzhu? ”

“Bai Jingfei had always thought that she would be more promising than Bai Jingzhu in the future, but she didn’t expect that she would still lose to Bai Jingzhu. ”

“Bai Jingzhu frowned slightly and was about to speak when Zhou Ying came from the back room and scolded her angrily, “Bai Jingfei, you’re going to die! How dare you talk to your sister? Apologize to your sister quickly!” ”

“Why should I apologize to her?”Bai jingfei snorted coldly.

“Bai Jiacheng’s voice suddenly sounded in the air. “Eldest sister is like a mother, don’t you know?” ”

Bai Jingshu frowned without leaving a trace. She subconsciously felt that something was not right.

Why had her parents changed so much out of the blue?

“Before Bai Jingshu could react, Bai Jiacheng squeezed out a smile and turned to look at Bai Jingshu, “Jingshu, you’re back. Come in quickly. I know that you like to eat food from Earth, so your mother prepared a big table of food for you tonight.” ”

Bai Jingshu nodded and followed Bai Jiacheng in.

“Only Bai Jingshu had a bowl and chopsticks in front of her, and the rest of the people had nutrient fluids in front of them. ”

“Bai Jiacheng looked at Bai Jingshu with a smile. “Jingshu, it’s all Daddy’s fault for misunderstanding you in the past. Daddy doesn’t know your aspirations, so Daddy is here to apologize to you!” ”

“”Dad, if you have anything to say, just say it. Don’t beat around the bush,”Bai Jingshu said. ”

“”Jingshu, master Chen and Madam Chen have already been here. You did the right thing in doing this! You should have left the Chen family with nowhere to run and come to us on your own initiative!”Bai Jiacheng said with a face full of praise. ”

Bai Jingshu furrowed her brows without leaving a trace. She felt that Bai Jiacheng was implying something.

“Bai jiasheng continued, “How about this, you go to the police station tomorrow and dismiss the case. Leave the rest to your mother and me. Don’t worry, we’ll definitely make your wedding beautiful.” ”
