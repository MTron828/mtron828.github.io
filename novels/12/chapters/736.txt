Chapter 737: 166: Can Ye Zao do it? Old Mrs. Lin fainted from anger

Translator: 549690339

“Before this, she was still skeptical.”

Now it seemed that there must be a misunderstanding. Maybe someone was framing Feng Qianhua and her daughter behind the scenes.

“If Feng Qianhua really poisoned old Mrs. Lin, would old Mrs. Lin still treat Feng Qianqian so well?”

Old Mrs. Lin was not stupid!

“If someone was framing Feng Qianhua and her daughter, it would definitely be Ye Zao.”

“Because in the Lin family, Feng Qianqian was the biggest threat to ye Zao.”

“After all, Old Lady Lin treated Feng Qianqian as her own granddaughter.”

“If ye Zao wanted to secure his position as the eldest daughter of the Lin family, he had to get rid of Feng Qianqian.”

“From the looks of it, Ye Zao was really shameless.”

“First, he stole Feng Xianxian’s position in the literary world and replaced Feng Xianxian as Master Yu’s disciple. Then, he stabbed Feng Xianxian in the back.”

An ordinary person really could not do what ye Zao did!

“Fortunately, Feng Xianxian was lucky enough to meet her.”

Liu Caiyi was born to fight injustice.

She did not like people who used small tricks to get to the top.

Feng Xianxian was busy making tea for Old Lady Lin.

“Old Lady Lin smiled and said, “Xianxian, you don’t have to work. I’ll just drink plain water.””

“Feng Xianxian was not willing to let Old Lady Lin Drink Plain water. After all, everything she had now was given to her by Old Lady Lin. Old Lady Lin was her breadwinner.”

“A few minutes later, Feng Xianxian came out of the kitchen with a cup of red date honey tea. “Grandma, this red date honey tea is to nourish qi and blood. Drinking it will be good for your body.”” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Old Lady Lin took the jujube honey tea from Feng Xianxian with a smile.

Feng Xianxian was still filial.

Unlike ye Zao.

“Ye Zao was still her biological granddaughter, but she had never been filial to her for a day.”

“Her body was not in good shape now, and the toxins in her body had not been cleaned. As a doctor, Ye Zao had the same blood as her in his bones, but ye Zao ignored it and did not save her!”

Who would be as cold-blooded and heartless as ye Zao?

He could actually watch his own grandmother die!

It was simply the heart of a snake and a scorpion!

“If it was Feng Xianxian, Feng Xianxian would definitely not be like this.”

Everyone said that she favored Feng Xianxian.

But was that really the case?

Ye Zao clearly did not have a granddaughter.

“As a grandmother, she had already lowered her head to ye Zao and admitted her mistakes, but ye Zao did not appreciate it at all.”

As long as ye Zao could perform a little better.

She would not be like this.

“Since ye Zao did not treat her as a grandmother, then there was no need for her to treat ye Zao as her own granddaughter.”

Because ye Zao was not worth it at all!

“Old Lady Lin drank a mouthful of red date honey tea and turned to look at Auntie Wang. She then said, “Auntie Wang, take out the pastries that I brought for Xianxian. Coincidentally, Miss Liu is here too. Let Miss Liu have a taste.””

“Okay.”Auntie Wang nodded and took out the thing that she had brought for Feng Xianxian.

“It was a very exquisite pastry, and it was still steaming when it was freshly baked.”

“Madam Lin smiled and said, “Miss Liu, quickly try this rose cake. How is it?””

“”Thank you, Madam.”Liu Caiyi elegantly picked up a piece of rose cake.”

“It was very sweet and soft, and it was very different from the normal rose cake that was sold on the market. Even for someone like Liu Caiyi, it was the first time she had eaten such a special rose cake.”

The Lin family was indeed the Lin family. Even an ordinary rose cake could be made in a different way.

“After tasting a piece of rose cake, Liu Caiyi stood up and said, “Xianxian, old madam, I still have something to do. I’ll be going back first.””

Old Madam Lin raised her head to look at Liu Caiyi. “Aren’t you going to sit for a while?”

“Liu caiyi smiled and said, “You’re too polite.””

“Feng Xianxian stood up and said, “Grandma, I’ll send Sister Caiyi off.””

“You go ahead.”Old Lady Lin nodded.

Feng Xianxian sent Liu Caiyi out of the apartment building.

“Liu Caiyi stopped in her tracks. “Alright, I’ll send her off here.””

“Feng xianxian nodded and said, “Then sister Caiyi, drive carefully on the road.””

“I will.”

“After watching Liu Caiyi get into the car, Feng Xianxian turned around and walked into the apartment.”

“When she returned to the apartment, Old Lady Lin asked curiously, “Xianxian, is your relationship with Miss Liu Very Good?””

“Feng Xianxian smiled and said, “Sister Caiyi is a very upright person. She doesn’t like people who use underhanded means behind their backs. I can be considered to have met a person who uses underhanded means behind my back.””

Who was the person who used underhanded means behind their backs?

“Of course, it was ye Zhuo!”

“If ye Zhuo did not use underhanded means, would she be able to become Master Yu’s disciple?”

Dream On!

“After saying this, Feng Xianxian continued, “Oh right, grandma, Sister Caiyi helped me get a spot in the literary world assessment. When the time comes, I would like to invite you to participate in the assessment.””
