Translator: 549690339

Cen Shaoqing had been a vegetarian for more than 20 years. Who would have thought that he would break his precepts for a woman?

“At first, the manager thought that ye Zhuo was a relative of CEN Shaoqing’s family. ”

Now it seemed that.

Things were more than that.

“If these two were really relatives, would cen Shaoqing break his precepts so easily? ”

“It seemed that this CEN fifth master, who was known to be a bachelor, was not far from the definition of true fragrance! ”

The manager gulped and took the tablet that ye Zhuo handed over. “Please wait a moment.”

The dishes were served very quickly in the restaurant.

“In about thirty minutes, all the dishes were served. ”

“Halfway through the meal, Ye Zhuo looked up at Cen Shaoqing and continued, “Oh right, I’m returning to Yun Jing Tomorrow.” ”

Cen Shaoqing wiped his mouth with a tissue. “Why are you going back all of a sudden? Didn’t you say that you’re going to spend the new year in the capital?”

“”Yes, I’m going to spend the new year in the capital.”Ye Zhuo continued, “I have other things to deal with when I go back this time.” ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “How many days will you be going back this time?”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “About... about a week or so. If things are troublesome, I might have to stay for a few more days.” ”

“Ceng Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads and thought for a while. “I’m quite busy these days, so I won’t be going back with you. What Time Is Your Flight Tomorrow?” ”

“Nine in the morning.”

Ceng Shaoqing nodded. “Have you booked the Flight?”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo drank a mouthful of seabuckthorn juice.

Ceng Shaoqing looked at his phone. “I have a meeting at nine in the morning. Do you want me to get a driver to send you?”

“”No need.”Ye Zhuo continued, “We have a driver at home. My Brother said that he would send me.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing grabbed ye Zhuo’s hand and opened his thin lips. “Zhuozhuo, I’m sorry.” ”

“Sorry for what?”Ye Zhuo asked in confusion.

“Cen Shaoqing’s deep eyes were filled with guilt. “As your boyfriend, I can’t send you to the airport nor accompany you back to Yun Jing. Zhuozhuo, I’m really sorry!” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “What’s there to be sorry about? Everyone has their own things to do, so we just need to understand each other.”It would be best if Cen Shaoqing could accompany her back, but Cen Shaoqing was not free, so ye Zao would not think too much about it. ”

The most important thing between a couple was to understand each other.

“After dinner, Cen Shaoqing and ye Zao went to the nearby food street. ”

“Ye Zao liked the food street very much. He liked the special snacks on the food street even more. Although the food street was full of roadside stalls, the taste was even better than those in high-end restaurants. ”

“Cen Shaoqing stood beside her and held her hand. As long as he lowered his eyes slightly, he could see her eyebrows and eyes. ”

“At this moment, his whole heart was filled. ”

He wished he could find a rope to tie her to the belt of his pants and not separate her from him at all times.

“”Do you want to try this candied haws?”At this moment, Ye Zhuo handed a string of bright red candied haws to Cen Shaoqing’s mouth. ”

“Cen Shaoqing was stunned at first, then he opened his mouth and took a bite of the candied haws. ”

It was slightly sour with a sweet taste.

The taste was very good.

“He was a person who did not like sweet food, but he did not know when he began to like this taste. ”

“How does it taste?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“It’s very good.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Another bite?”

Cen Shaoqing opened his mouth and took another bite.

“At this moment, ye Zhuo’s gaze suddenly stopped not far away, his expression slightly focused. ”

“What are you looking at?”

Cen Shaoqing asked in puzzlement.

Ye Zhuo narrowed his eyes and pointed not far away. “Does that person look like my fourth uncle?”

Cen Shaoqing looked up.

He saw a man and a woman eating at a stall not far away.

The man was about forty years old and wore a suit.

“The woman looked about his age and was wearing a white down jacket. Perhaps there was something in her hair. At this moment, the man was standing up and helping her remove the thing on her head. ”

“Just by looking at it, she looked a little intimate. ”

“”It’s fourth uncle.”CEN Shaoqing continued, “Should we go up and say Hello?” ”

Ye Zhuo hesitated for a moment. “I don’t think so. I think fourth uncle is dating aunt Xia. Let’s not be a third wheel.”

“You know that aunt?”Cen Shaoqing asked. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “She’s my good friend Lizi’s mother.”

That’s right.

The person who was with Lin Qingxuan was Xia Xiaoman.

“Ye Zao was a little surprised. Last time, she had joked in front of Lin Qingxuan and asked him to pursue Xia Xiaoman. At that time, Lin Qingxuan had rejected her. He did not expect the two of them to develop so quickly! ”
