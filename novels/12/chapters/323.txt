“At this point, Cen Yueya’s eyes were almost sparkling. ”

It was as if she had already seen her future sister-in-law.

She originally wanted to ask Old Mrs. Cen to send a photo of ye Zao for her to see.

But Old Mrs. Cen refused no matter what!

She said she was afraid that she would scare her precious granddaughter-in-law!

Ha!

Was she the kind of person who did not know what was important and what was not?

“Therefore, up until now, Cen Yueya had only heard ye Zao’s voice and did not see him. ”

She was dying of curiosity.

She had been imagining what her future sister-in-law would look like.

It was as if a cat’s paw was constantly scratching her heart!

“Cen Shaoqing looked speechlessly at Cen Yueya on the other end of the screen. He was just about to say something when Cen Yueya retorted back, “Are you trying to say that you’re not getting married? Come on! Hurry up and say it! I’m recording the video! If you dare to say it, I’ll take today’s video and slap your face until it’s swollen! For a dog like you, it’s already good enough for someone to take a fancy to you! Grandma told me that my future sister-in-law is fair-skinned and beautiful! She looks just like the one who walked out of a painting! Look at you, you’re old, you don’t know how to Flirt, you’re a vegetarian, and you don’t want to get married! You can still see other than that face, what else do you have ”

Don’t say that you have money! What can money do? Can Money Buy My Smile?”

Cen Shaoqing:”...”

“Seeing that Cen Shaoqing didn’t say anything, Cen Yueya was satisfied and continued the topic. “I originally wanted to buy a set of diamond jewelry for my future sister-in-law, but big sister has already prepared the diamond jewelry!” ”

Cen Shaoqing was a 31-year-old bachelor.

It was not easy for him to say that he had found a wife.

The CEN sisters were very happy and each prepared a generous gift.

“Now, they were just waiting for Old Madam Cen and the others to return. ”

Everything was ready except for the east wind.

“Speaking up to this point, Cen Yueya looked at CEN Shaoqing and continued, “Can you send me a picture of your future sister-in-law? Can you satisfy my curiosity?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing raised his hand to look at his watch. “I have an important meeting to attend, so I won’t talk to you anymore.” ”

“With that, he cut the video call. ”

Cen Shaoqing knew this second sister too well.

“Cen Yueya was very capable and talkative. Unlike other strong women, she was especially gossipy. ”

“Even when she was with a few old ladies, she could chat for three days and three nights. ”

“Seeing that the video was hung up, Cen Yueya was furious and sent the video to Cen Shaoqing again. ”

[ you are not the other party’s good friend yet. Are you going through the friend verification? ]

Cen Yueya:”! ! !”This smelly younger brother really pissed her off.

...

At the Ye residence.

Ye Zhuo was drawing something with his head down in front of his desk.

“At this moment, Whitey’s voice came from outside the door, “Da Zhuozhuo, there’s someone knocking on the door. I don’t know who it is. Should I open the door?” ”

“”Let me open it.”Ye Zhuoluo looked up slightly, put down the pen in his hand, and walked out. ”

Ye zhuoluo walked over to open the door.

“Just as he opened the door, he saw director Zhou and Gu decing who was standing beside him. ”

“Ye zhuoluo said in surprise, “Director Zhou, doctor Gu!” ”

“Director Zhou said, “Miss Ye, is it convenient for you now?” ”

Ye Zhuoluo nodded slightly. “There’s time. Come in quickly.”

Xiao Baibai was very observant as she went to pour water for the guests.

“Ye Zhuo brought director Zhou and Gu Dening to the living room. “The house is rather simple and crude. Director Zhou, doctor Gu, please take a seat. Don’t stand on ceremony.” ”

Director Zhou looked around the living room.

It was indeed very simple and elegant.

“If he had not seen it with his own eyes, a miracle doctor who cured cancer and the top scorer in Yun Jing City’s college entrance examination would have lived in such a simple house! ”

What did he mean by indifferent to fame and fortune?

This should be it.

“With the current conditions of the Ye family, it would not be a problem for them to live in a big villa and hire a few servants! ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Director Zhou, doctor Gu, did you come here today to look for me for something?” ”

“Director Zhou stood up. “Miss Ye, the YKA drug that you developed has benefited all of mankind! Doctor Gu and I have specially come to thank you on behalf of the medical community and cancer patients from all over the country!” ”

“Speaking up to this point, director Zhou and Gu Dening bowed to ye Zao together. ”

“”Director Zhou, Doctor Gu, you don’t have to do this!”Ye Zao also stood up immediately. ”

“Director Zhou continued, “Originally, a few experts from the medical community wanted to come with us. After they learned that you were unwilling to meet other people, they entrusted us to bring the glory and bonus that belongs to you.” ”

Gu deling immediately took out a beautiful gift box. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Inside the gift box was a trophy and an envelope with a check.
