“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Ye Zhuo continued to ask, “What about you? Do you have a brother?” ”

“Zhao Xueyin shook her head slightly, “I’m an only child, so I hope that I can have a brother or sister!” ”

“Ten minutes later, the two of them arrived at the inpatient department. Zhao Xueyin stopped in her tracks, “Ye Zhuo, my friend’s ward is over there. I’ll go over first! I’ll treat you to tea when I have time.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“After parting ways with Zhao Xueyin, ye Zao brought some food to the ward. ”

“An Lizi immediately came up to him and gossiped, “Zao Zao, who was that girl who went upstairs with you just now?” ”

“Ye Zao placed the food on the table. “We met when we were buying food. She has a friend who lives on the third floor, so we came up together.” ”

“OH.”An Lizi nodded. “I think she’s quite pretty.”

“She’s really not bad.”Ye Zao agreed.

“Zhao pingting came out of the bathroom. “Zao Zao, what are we having for lunch?”With Ye Zao and an Lizi accompanying her for the past few days, Zhao Pingting was in a much better mood. ”

“Ye Zao said, “We ordered a blood curd, then a silver fish soup, steamed eggs with clams, sour and spicy tofu, and a super hot pot pork with rice.”Actually, there was also an after-dinner dessert, however, an Lizi and Zhao Pingting were afraid of gaining weight, so they hardly ate desserts. Therefore, ye Zao always took care of all the after-dinner desserts. ”

“Zhao Pingting had already drunk a bowl of porridge in the morning. When she heard that there were so many delicious dishes, she couldn’t help but swallow her throat. “Then let’s eat quickly!” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “You and Lizi eat first. I’m going to wash my hands.” ”

“”Hurry up,”Zhao pingting continued, “We’ll wait for you to eat together.” ” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

In another ward.

“Zhao Xueyin sat on the sofa and turned on her phone. Her phone screen displayed a wechat page. She had just added ye Zao as well. At this moment, Zhao Xueyin clicked on ye Zao’s profile page. ”

“Zhao Xueyin had originally thought that she could learn more about ye Zao through her moments. After all, young girls nowadays were especially sentimental. They moaned and moaned without any illness. No matter what happened, they liked to post on moments to attract the attention of others, ye Zao was certainly no exception. ”

“However, ye Zao’s wechat moments were actually empty. Not only was there not a single photo, but there was also no text content. ”

Zhao Xueyin frowned slightly. It seemed that there was still some difference between ye Zao and an ordinary girl.

“However, it was normal when she thought about it. ”

“If ye Zao was no different from an ordinary girl, how could she have such amazing achievements in the scientific and technological world? ”

This was the so-called high IQ and low eq.

“After spending some time with ye Zhuo, in Zhao Xueyin’s eyes, Ye Zhuo was no different from a fool. ”

“With her IQ, it would be too easy for others to lie to her. ”

“Just as Zhao Xueyin was thinking, the door of the ward was pushed open. ”

Creak —

The crisp sound of the door opening interrupted Zhao Xueyin’s train of thought. Zhao Xueyin turned around and saw a tall and long-legged lawyer walking in from outside.

“Xueyin.”

Zhao Xueyin hurriedly stood up from the sofa. “Big Brother Si! Why are you here?”

“The lawyer smiled and said, “Uncle is very worried about you, so he asked me to come over to take a look.” ”

Father Zhao would ask the lawyer to come over to see her?

“Zhao Xue smiled gently, but her smile did not reach her eyes. “My father probably doesn’t know that you’re here, right?” ”

“Although she was her father’s only daughter, the father-daughter relationship between them was not that strong. ”

“Zhao Xueyin’s mother, Liu Qin, died during childbirth. Zhao Zhendong’s father, Zhao Zhendong, was unable to have children due to an error in surgery in his early years. This was also the real reason why Zhao Zhendong regretted that she was a girl but did not find someone to remarry and have children with. ”

“People outside said that Zhao Zhendong was an infatuated child. After his late wife passed away, he did not find anyone else. ”

Famous scholars in the academic world even wrote a poem to praise Zhao Zhendong.

“In fact, only Zhao Xueyin herself knew that it was not because Zhao Zhendong was very affectionate. He was very eager to remarry and have a son, but unfortunately... ... Zhao Zhendong was also powerless. ”

“If Zhao Zhendong could have a son, she would definitely not be Zhao Zhendong’s only child, nor would she be groomed by Zhao Zhendong to be his successor. ”

“To Zhao Zhendong’s biological father, she was just better than nothing! ”

“Thinking of this, Zhao Xueyin’s eyes were filled with self-mockery. ”

“Hearing this, an awkward expression flashed across Si Lui’s face, he continued, “You can see it! Actually, uncle still cares about you a lot. It’s just that uncle isn’t good at expressing himself. Don’t think too much about it.”As a bystander.., and Zhao Xueyin’s admirer, Si lui naturally hoped that the father and daughter could be well. ”
