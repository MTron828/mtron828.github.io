This was the first time.

“At this moment, his cell phone suddenly rang. ”

“Professor Feng took out his cell phone. When he saw the caller ID, his whole person came alive. He immediately picked up the phone, afraid that the other party would hang up in the next second. “Yingying.” ”

“Ever since Feng Ying went abroad, she rarely took the initiative to call Professor Feng. Most of the time, it was professor Feng who called Feng Ying. ”

“Mom.”Feng Ying’s voice came from the other end.

“”Yes, Ying Ying, why are you still calling me so late? Did Something Happen?” ”

“It was currently two o’clock in the afternoon in China, but in country L, it was indeed more than ten o’clock at night. ”

“Feng Ying continued, “Mom, thank you.” ”

Thank you?

Thank you for what?

“Professor Feng was stunned for a moment and said with a smile, “You Child, why are you speaking so incoherently?” ”

“Feng Ying said, “Thank you for finding a connection for me to enter the International Fashion Department.” ”

“Professor Feng said in surprise, “So soon?” ”

She had only signed the contract two hours ago. She did not expect that Feng Ying would receive the news so soon.

“”Yes.”Feng Ying’s voice sounded a little excited, “I submitted my resume to the international fashion department previously, but they said that my qualifications were not enough. Just now, the head of the international department called me personally and said that I was accepted. I asked him why, and he said that he would thank me for having a good mother. So, Mom, thank you.” ”

“”Silly Child, why are you thanking me?”Professor Feng said. ”

“Feng Ying continued, “Mom, where did you find the connections? Did you ask a lot of people?”The international fashion department was not a place that could be easily entered. Its founder was the first president of C Nation! Then, the president joined forces with 27 major countries to set up the international fashion department! ”

The clothes produced by the international fashion department were exclusively for the leaders of various countries and the nobles of various countries!

Being able to enter the international fashion department was also a symbol of status!

Feng Ying’s biggest dream in her life was to successfully enter the international fashion department!

Even if she had to use a backdoor to get in.

“”Mom, thank you! It was my fault before. I always felt that you didn’t care about me...”Feng Ying had always held a grudge against Professor Feng, she felt that Professor Feng didn’t take her biological daughter at all. Only now did she realize that in this world, the person who loved her the most was always her mother! ”

It was so difficult to enter the international fashion department. It was imaginable how much effort professor Feng had put in for this.

“”Silly child, don’t blame yourself. Mom really didn’t do anything.”It was inappropriate to say anything else, professor Feng continued, “Oh right, Yingying, mom has decided to move to country C. in the future, we can live together forever.” ”

“”Really?”Feng Ying was very excited. “Mom, are you really going to emigrate?” ”

“”Yes, of course it’s true.”Professor Feng smiled and said, “When did mom lie to You?” ”

“”That’s great! Mom, when will you go through the immigration procedures?”Feng Ying continued to ask. ”

“”About a month later,”professor Feng said. ”

“Okay.”Feng Ying was very happy. “Then I’ll look at the house here first. Then we’ll live together and have a cat and a dog!”

“”You don’t have to worry about the house,”professor Feng continued, “I’ve already asked someone to take care of it. I’ll send you the address in a while. You can go over and decorate it first. The decoration will be done according to your preferences.” ”

Gamila bought a super luxurious villa for the mother and daughter in the center of C Nation.

“”Mom, Are You Rich?”Feng Ying asked. ”

“Although Professor Feng’s salary was very high and he had a seven-figure income every month, almost all of Professor Feng’s money was invested in Feng Ying. ” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Fashion design was a very expensive profession. Feng Ying needed money to organize personal exhibitions, study, and even survive abroad. ”

“All these years, Feng Ying didn’t earn a single cent. She spent almost all of Professor Feng’s money! ”

“Professor Feng smiled and said, “Yes, I’m Rich. Ying Ying, I have an experiment at three o’clock. I Won’t talk to you about it for now.” ”

“”Okay. Then Mom, you go ahead and do your work.” ”

“After hanging up the phone, professor Feng felt much better. ”

“At least after agreeing to Gamira’s plan, her daughter’s opinion of her changed a lot. ”

“In the future, she would also live with her daughter forever. ”

“Not only did she gain family affection, but she also gained dreams. ”

“Thinking of this, professor Feng felt a lot less guilty. ”
