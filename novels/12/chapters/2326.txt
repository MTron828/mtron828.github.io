[ Ah Ah Ah! I’m so excited! I Can’t wait to see the press conference. ]

“Even Country C’s Micaidi personally used his V account to issue a statement: Everyone should have the spirit of a contract. I can understand Dr. YC’s current mood, but signing the bet means signing it, i hope Dr. YC can accept reality. He can win, but he can also lose! If I were Dr. YC, I would definitely not deny it! ”

“When these words were said, the internet was filled with cheers. ”

“Dr. Zhang was very anxious. He brought his phone to Ye Zhuo. “Miss Ye, what should we do now?” ”

Ye Zhuo flipped a page of the document. “What’s Wrong?”

“Upon hearing this, Professor Zhang said in disbelief, “You haven’t read the comments online, have you?” ”

“”I have,”ye Zao said. ”

He was still so calm after reading it?

Professor Zhang looked at Ye Zao in disbelief.

“Ye Zao closed the document and continued, “Can we come up with a solution just because we’re Anxious?” ”

Professor Zhang was stunned.

“Although he couldn’t come up with a solution even if he was anxious, ye Zao shouldn’t be so calm. ”

“After all, they were now riding on the shoulders of C Nation! ”

“Professor Zhang continued, “Miss Ye, what should we do now?” ”

“Ye Zao narrowed his eyes. “In the current situation, we can only take this loss.” ”

“What?”Professor Zhang said in disbelief.

Ye Zao did not say anything and pressed his temples.

“Professor Zhang continued, “Miss Ye! This is clearly a conspiracy of C nation. How can you take this loss!” ”

“”Other than this method, there’s nothing else we can do,”ye Zao said. ”

Professor Zhang had never thought that things would come to this point. He sat weakly on his chair.

“Ye Zao sighed softly and continued, “I also didn’t expect C nation to use such a move.” ”

“Professor Zhang frowned tightly. “Miss Ye, I know this isn’t your problem...” ”

“Outside the door, Wen Zhi had heard everything that had happened inside. The corners of his mouth curled into a smug smile. ”

He didn’t expect ye Zao to have such a day.

Country C’s Mi Jiadi and Kevin were already discussing the celebration party.

“After all, Ye Zao was now a piece of meat on the chopping board. ” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

He couldn’t escape even if he had wings.

“Right now, all they had to do was wait patiently for the global press conference to arrive. ”

Time passed quickly.

“In the blink of an eye, the day of the press conference had arrived. ”

“There were still two hours before the press conference, but the audience in the global live studio had already reached one billion. ”

This was a press conference that attracted the attention of the whole world.

Everyone was waiting for ye Zao to announce the failure of the oasis plan.

The press conference started at 10:18 a.m.

There were still 10 minutes to 10:18 a.m.

“All the leaders of the various countries were already in place, including country C’s Mi Jiadi, Kevin, and the others. ”

Mi Jiadi was dressed up and attending the press conference. Her face was filled with a proud smile.

“After all, there was a saying in China that one had to enjoy life to the fullest. ”

“Next, it was time for their country C to be proud! ”

“Not long after, ye Zao walked in from the entrance. ”

Mi Jiadi immediately walked forward. “I thought Dr. YC wouldn’t be here today.”

“After all, the OASIS project had failed. It was just a verdict. Ye Zao didn’t need to be there personally. He just needed to find someone. ”

“Ye Zao was wearing black clothes, and there was a layer of coldness between his brows. “Dr. Mi Jiadi, you must be joking. I naturally have to come personally for such an important occasion.” ”

“”Dr. YC has a good mentality,”mi Jiadi said. ”

Ye Zao smiled faintly. “Thank you. You’re also very good.”

“Looking at ye Zao like this, Mi Jiadi frowned slightly. He felt that something was wrong, but he could not figure out what exactly was wrong. ”

Could it be that ye Zao had already thought of a corresponding plan?

No!

It could not be!

“The Oasis project had already failed, so how could there be a corresponding rescue plan? ”

10:18 pm.

“Ye Zhuo was on the stage. She slightly leaned over and dialed the microphone. Although it was a very casual move, it exploded with a powerful aura. Her tone was slow, she enunciated each word clearly. “Hello, everyone. I am the chief planner of the OASIS project, YC. The Oasis project was launched in 18 years, and it officially ended in May of 20 years. Now, I announce that the OASIS project has been successfully completed. In the future, mankind will have an additional habitable home!” ”

“Once these words were said, the entire venue fell silent. ”

No one had expected that the OASIS Project project had been successfully completed.

The bullet screen before the live broadcast also exploded.

[ what’s going on? is YC bragging? ]

[ didn’t they say that the OASIS project had failed? There was even a video posted earlier! ]

[ YC is too bold. He actually dares to say anything! ]

“Ye Zhuo faced everyone and the camera, then he said, “At this moment, everyone must be very confused as to why there was such a reversal. “Because from the beginning, the OASIS project was completed very smoothly. The reason why there was a twist was that I wanted to catch the betrayer behind the scenes and let those people with bad intentions suffer the consequences!” ”

Yes.

All of this was planned in advance by Ye Zhuo.

“If she didn’t do this, why would country C take the initiative to sign the BET agreement and throw down one piece of evidence after another? ”

“Below the stage, Mi Jiadi’s face turned white. ”

How could this be?
