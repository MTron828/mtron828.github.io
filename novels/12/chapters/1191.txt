“Chapter 1192: 256: Si Lui suddenly came to his senses! Face slapping, Master Five’s vest dropped all over the floor! 1”

Translator: 549690339

Wishful thinking.

Not even considered as an ordinary friend?

“Hearing these words, Si lui was stunned. ”

The color on his face disappeared completely.

“At this moment, he almost thought he was hearing things. ”

Si Lui’s hand holding the cup was trembling.

He heard wrong.

He must have heard it wrong.

He and Zhao Xueyin were clearly in love.

How could it be considered wishful thinking?

The lawyer tried his best to calm himself down and took a sip of water from the glass.

The conversation next door was still going on.

“Li Chaoyang looked at Zhao Xueyin and calmly rolled up his sleeves. His tone was neither fast nor slow. “Miss Zhao, I know that many women in the workplace are unwilling to expose their relationships. I can understand if you say so!” ”

“Seeing that the misunderstanding was getting worse, Zhao Xueyin was very anxious. ”

The person she was going to marry was master five. She could not let a lawyer ruin all of her plans.

“She knew that the lawyer’s wishes would ruin things, but she did not expect that master five would also have a misunderstanding because of this. ”

No.

She could not let master five continue to misunderstand. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

She had to clarify the matter.

“Zhao Xueyin continued, “Special Assistant Li, you misunderstand. I have nothing to do with the lawyer. For such a long time, it was really just his own amusement and wishful thinking.” ”

Li Chaoyang picked up his cup and took a sip of tea. “Are you sure it was Mr. Lawyer’s wishful thinking? But the rumors I heard in Shunxi Financial Group were not like that. Everyone said that you and Mr. Lawyer are a perfect match!”

Perfect Match?

What kind of perfect match was there between her and Mr. Si?

The lawyer was only working for the Zhao family.

“A worker, and he still wanted to be with her? ”

It was ridiculous!

“Zhao Xueyin raised her hand and tidied her hair, “To be honest, the lawyer has wanted to be the son-in-law of our Zhao family for a long time! He even tried every means to please my father. In fact, my father doesn’t really like him, but due to the friendship of the previous generation and the fact that my father is a soft-hearted person, it’s not good to ignore him. That’s why he hasn’t fallen out with him. Speaking of which, the lawyer is also a blind man. My father clearly doesn’t like him at all, but he’s full of confidence... ... .. ”

“At this point, Zhao Xueyin sighed, then, she said, “Actually, these unrealistic words were spread by the lawyer. I really have nothing to do with him. Rumors are scary. He just wants to use these rumors to confirm our relationship.” ”

Zhao Xueyin had never admitted her relationship with the lawyer in public.

“Then, why was there such a rumor spreading in the Shunxi Financial Group? ”

It was clearly the lawyer who let it spread.

Shameless.

The lawyer was simply shameless to the extreme!

He did not even look at himself in the mirror to see what kind of person he was.

“Li Chaoyang nodded, he said in disbelief, “I didn’t expect Mr. Lawyer to act like a gentleman, to actually do such a thing in the mainland. It almost caused me to misunderstand that the two of you are really a couple. However, this lawyer is indeed not good enough for Miss Zhao. When I thought that the two of you were a couple, I felt a wave of regret!” ”

Regret?

What did Li Chaoyang have to regret.

“The one who was truly regretful, master five. ”

It was just something that came out from Li Chaoyang’s mouth.

“Zhao Xueyin was very excited, but on the surface, she did not move, she pretended to be very regretful and said, “Actually, I did not expect the lawyer to be this kind of person! However, this is not strange. There is a saying that one can not tell a person’s heart from their face. Fortunately, I saw his true face in time, so there was no actual loss.” ”

Li Zhaoyang nodded and agreed with what Zhao Xueyin said.

One can not tell a person’s heart from their face.

“What a good phrase, one can not tell a person’s heart from their face. ”

The lawyer leaned against the back of the chair.

His face was pale.

He had never thought that he was this kind of person in Zhao Xueyin’s heart.

“If he had not experienced it personally, he would not believe that these words were said by the kind and simple Zhao Xueyin. ”

This Zhao Xueyin was like a different person.

Extremely unfamiliar.

Laughable.

Simply laughable.

He naively thought that Zhao Xueyin had him in her heart.

They liked each other.

“In fact, in Zhao Xueyin’s heart, he was a dispensable person. ”

Zhao Xueyin had been using him.

“Thinking about how he had fought Yang Wenhao a few days ago in order to protect Zhao Xueyin, the lawyer even regretted it. It was even worse than dying. ”

Yang Wenhao was right.

Idiot!

He was the real idiot.
