“”Beauty, you may have misunderstood. It’s really not about the money,”the long-haired girl explained patiently. ”

“Zheng Wanyin was a little impatient. She was not willing to name her own price, but she still felt that 200 yuan was too low. ”

She was insatiable.

“If Xie Wanqiu did not want to eat the oil tea fruit, she would not even want to give two yuan, let alone 200 yuan. ”

“Zheng Wanyin was a cultured person. Although she thought so in her heart, she didn’t show it at all. ”

“Seeing this, the sweet-looking girl beside the long-haired girl hurriedly said, “Lizi, are you really not selling?” ”

An Lizi shook her head. “I’m not selling.”

“The sweet-looking girl raised her head and looked at Zheng Wanyin. “Beauty, I’ll sell mine to You!” ”

It was 200 yuan.

She could buy 10% of the oil tea fruit.

“Zheng wanyin smiled and said, “Sure, thank you.” ”

“”You’re welcome.”The sweet-looking girl handed the oil tea fruit to Zheng wanyin and said, “Pretty girl, if there’s such a good thing next time, you must tell me.” ”

“Zheng Wanyin’s eyes were full of disdain, but she did not show it on her face. She nodded and said, “Okay.” ”

“Looking at Zheng Wanyin’s departing figure, the sweet-looking girl held an Lizi’s arm and said, “Lizi, let’s go. You can accompany me to buy another serving of oil tea fruit.” ”

“An lizi smiled and said, “Qingqing, I have another serving here. Why don’t we split it equally?” ”

“Zhang Qingqing said, “It’s no fun to eat more than half. Why Don’t you accompany me to buy another serving!” ”

“An Lizi looked at the crowd in line and said, “This will take more than an hour!” ”

“”Isn’t it just an hour? Let’s go, Let’s Go!”Zhang Qingqing continued, “I came all the way to the capital to see you. Aren’t you willing to accompany me to line up?” ”

“An Lizi really couldn’t be bothered to line up. She stuffed her oil tea fruit into Zhang Qingqing’s hand and said, “You can eat mine! Anyway, I live in the capital and can eat it anytime! I’ll buy it when there are fewer people.” ”

“”Lizi, thank you!”Zhang Qingqing hugged an Lizi. ” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Don’t stand on ceremony with me.”

“Zhang Qingqing ate her food, she said, “Lizi, I’m really envious of you. We grew up together when we were young. Now You’re the daughter of the Lin family, and I’m still the same person I was when I was young.”Zhang Qingqing and an Lizi grew up together, the relationship between the two of them was not bad. ”

“Seeing an lizi turn from an ordinary commoner to a daughter of a rich family, it would be a lie to say that she was not envious! ”

“Zhang Qingqing continued, “Lizi, who are the higher-ups you’re in contact with now? If there’s a chance, find a rich man for my mother! Let me experience the feeling of being a daughter of a rich family.” ”

“Hearing that, an Lizi widened her eyes and looked at Zhang Qingqing. “Uncle and Auntie?” ”

She remembered that Zhang Qingqing’s parents had always been on good terms.

“Zhang Qingqing smiled and said, “I’m just joking with you! However, if there’s a chance, you can introduce me to a rich second generation. However, you’re not allowed to introduce those random people to me! I want someone with a similar family background to your stepfather. It would be best if he’s an only child at home... ...” ”

“Although Zhang Qingqing had never come into contact with any real wealthy families, she had watched television before. ”

“There were many children in wealthy families. It was fine when they were young, but when it came to dividing up the family assets, they would definitely fight until their heads were split. ”

An only child was much better.

An only child did not need to split up the family assets with others.

“After saying that, Zhang Qingqing continued, “It doesn’t matter what a person looks like. As long as the family has money, it’s fine. The most important thing is that you have to be on par with your stepfather’s family.” ”

“As an Lizi’s good friend, the two of them had grown up together. Zhang Qingqing did not want to be inferior to an Lizi. ”

“Seeing that Zhang Qingqing did not seem to be joking, an Lizi was stunned. ”

“Although she and Zhang Qingqing had grown up together, the Zhang family had moved away when they were 15 years old. ”

This was the first time they had met since they separated.

For five whole years.

“When she saw Zhang Qingqing again, an Lizi felt that she had changed a lot. ”

But she didn’t know what exactly had changed.

“In short, it was a little strange. ”

“But it was also possible that they hadn’t been together for too long, so they were a little unfamiliar with each other. ”

“”Lizi, I’m talking to you! Didn’t you hear me?”Zhang Qingqing patted an Lizi’s shoulder. ”

“”I heard you.”An Lizi finally reacted. She smiled and said, “Don’t worry, I’ll remember everything for you.” ”

“Zhang Qingqing smiled and said, “Then you mustn’t forget!” ”

“Yes.”An Lizi nodded.
