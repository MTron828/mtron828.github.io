Chapter 1598: 341: Every Minute and second is torture. Who does she think she is! 1

Translator: 549690339

It’s her.

How could it be her...

“Mu Yourong looked at the photo on the table. Her eyes were filled with disbelief, and her entire body was trembling.”

She saw that the person in the photo was none other than ye Zao.

It was ye Zao.

How could it be ye Zao?

She had seen wrongly.

She must have seen wrongly.

“Mu Yourong tried her best to calm herself down. Step by step, she walked towards the desk.”

She was already in front of the desk.

But the scene before her eyes had not changed.

It was ye Zao.

The person in the photo was ye Zao.

Why would ye Zao’s photo appear in song Shiyu’s study?

What was the relationship between the two of them?

Could it be that.

She had died in her previous life because of ye Zao?

“Because she had killed ye Zao, so song Shiyu wanted to avenge ye Zao?”

But what was song Shiyu’s relationship with ye Zao?

Why did song Shiyu want to take revenge for ye Zao?

What was the reason for all of this?

“For a moment, Mu Yourong’s mind was filled with question marks.”

At this moment.

Mu Yourong suddenly recalled the scene when she first met song Shiyu.

“It could be seen that at the beginning, song Shiyu definitely had her in his heart.”

“Otherwise, song Shiyu would not have spent so much money to support the MU family.” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“He remembered that on the night of their wedding, after song Shiyu saw her arm, his attitude had completely changed.”

Right.

Could it be that there was something wrong with her arm?

“Just as Mu Yourong was still unable to react, her assistant walked in from outside the door.”

“Boss.”

“”Speak.”The man who had been standing in front of the French window turned around, revealing a face as beautiful as jade.”

“No one would have thought that there was a perverted, twisted, and dark heart hidden under this gentle, jade-like skin.”

“Although the assistant had been by song Shiyu’s side for a long time, the assistant was still a little nervous. He continued, “Boss, we have found Miss Mu Zhuo’s grave.””

“Send me the address.”Song Shiyu’s face was expressionless.

“He had thought of many scenarios in which they would recognize each other, but he had never imagined that they would be separated forever.”

The little girl from back then had left.

The last ray of light in his heart had also disappeared.

“Alright.”The assistant nodded and sent the address to Song Shiyu.

“After receiving the address, song Shiyu immediately walked out of the office.”

“Seeing this scene, the disbelief in Mu Yourong’s eyes gradually turned into shock and anger!”

It really was ye Zao.

It really was ye Zao!

Mu Yourong’s gaze instantly became ferocious. She wanted to pick up the photo on the table and smash it into pieces.

But she had forgotten.

She was in a dream.

Mu Yourong’s hand directly passed through the photo frame.

“Looking at song Shiyu’s back, Mu Yourong burst into tears. “It’s not fair! Song Shiyu! This is not fair to me!””

It was a pity.

The song Shiyu in her dream could not hear her voice.

Mu Yourong had never imagined that she had died because of ye Zao in her previous life.

Song Shiyu had married her only to torture her and avenge ye Zao.

Ridiculous.

Simply Ridiculous!

Mu Yourong was about to burst into tears from laughing.

“In her previous life, up until the moment of her death, she had never thought that she had died because of ye Zao.”

Stupid.

She was simply the Dumbest Idiot in the world.

“At this moment, Mu Yourong’s emotions were about to collapse.”

Her face was deathly pale.

...

“When Mu Yourong woke up again, her body was soft and she could not muster the slightest strength.”

Where was she?

“Mu Yourong wanted to open her mouth to speak, but after opening her mouth, she could not make a single sound.”

Mu Yourong’s expression instantly became flustered.

What was wrong with her?

Why was she unable to speak.

“Mu Yourong tried to call for help, but she could not utter a single word.”

It was as if she had lost her vocal cords.

It was somewhat terrifying.

It was also at this moment that Mu Yourong remembered that she had been captured by song Shiyu.

And that terrifying dream.

“Mu Yourong was someone who had been reborn, so she naturally knew that everything she had experienced in that dream was real.”

Ye Zao.

It was all because of ye Zao.

The reason why she had experienced all of this was all because of ye Zao.

“Why didn’t that Slut Ye Zao Die! In her previous life, he wouldn’t let her off, but in this life, he actually wouldn’t let her off!”

Mu Yourong’s eyes were filled with monstrous hatred.

Two lives.

What should she do?

What should she do now?

“If she fell into the hands of Song Shiyu, this demon of the human world, would she have to wait for death?”

“Mu Yourong wanted to do something, but unfortunately, she could not do anything.”

Time passed by minute by minute.

No one knew how torturous her life was now.

On the other side.

The Zeng family in Yunjing.

Zeng Rou had been chased out of the Zhao family.

Zeng’s parents were so angry that they wanted to send Zeng Rou to the Zhao family
