Break up.

“At this moment, Feng Yang even felt like he was hearing things.”

Who was breaking up with whom?

Zhou Ziyue was breaking up with him?

“”Why?”Feng Yang looked at Zhou Ziyue, his eyes filled with disbelief. “Ziyue, are you kidding me?””

“”I’m not kidding.”Zhou Ziyue sighed. “Feng Yang, we’re not compatible.””

They were really not suitable for each other.

Feng Yang could never give her what she wanted.

“Ye Sui was right. It was better to cut the pain short than to drag it out. Rather than dragging it out, it was better to cut ties with Feng Yang as soon as possible.”

“What’s not suitable?”Feng Yang looked at Zhou Ziyue. “We’ve been together for ten years. We know each other better than we know ourselves.”

“Zhou Ziyue looked at Feng Yang and continued, “Feng Yang, you’re a good person. I’m not worthy of you.””

“Speaking up to this point, Zhou ziyue continued, “When I was in high school, everyone thought that I was better than you. At that time, I thought that I might really not be good enough for you.””

“Zhou Ziyue was also very sad to break up with Feng Yang, but she had no choice but to break up with him.”

She and Feng Yang were not from the same world.

She also did not want to repeat ye Sui’s life after she married Feng Yang.

“Feng Yang put his hands on Zhou Ziyue’s shoulders and said, “Ziyue, it’s not like that! There’s no such thing between us. It’s been so many years. Do you still have a grudge against us?””

“Zhou Ziyue’s eyes were a little red, she sobbed and said, “You don’t understand my feelings at all, because I was the one who was involved in the matter! And you were just a bystander, so you never felt that those things hurt me! Instead, you were gloating! Gloating that someone would be jealous of you and Smear Me!””

“It was fine if she didn’t think about some things, but the more she thought about it, the more Zhou Ziyue felt that the things back then were unfair to her.”

Feng Yang was very handsome.

“But at the same time, Feng Yang was also very poor.”

“”I didn’t.”Feng Yang looked at Zhou Ziyue. “I never thought about it that way! Ziyue, why haven’t you said these things before? !””

“”Because I thought that some things would be over in the past, but I didn’t expect that the pain would stay with me until now.”Zhou ziyue continued, “Feng Yang, think about it. Before you decided on anything, did you ever discuss it with me? “You didn’t. You always made a dictatorial decision!”Zhou ziyue continued, “The most important thing for two people to be together is mutual understanding and respect, but we didn’t. You always thought that I was trying to climb up to you. For example, buying a house. You never asked for my opinion.””

“”I didn’t ask for your opinion on buying a House?”Feng Yang finally realized that something was wrong. He looked at Zhou Ziyue and said, “I’ve been asking you. If you didn’t nod, I didn’t pay.””

“Hearing this, Zhou Ziyue became even angrier, she said angrily, “Then what do you mean? What does it have to do with me if you buy a house? “If I agree, what if the house price falls? Will you blame me? “Also, if I agree and our relationship breaks up later, will you blame me for agreeing to buy a house for Love? “You just want to trap me with the House!””

“So that’s what you think in Your Heart?”Feng Yang’s expression was unclear.

He was very sad.

Very sad.

“He never knew that in Zhou Ziyue’s eyes, he was already unbearable to this extent.”

“What I think depends on how you do it!”Zhou Ziyue said.

“”So,”Feng Yang looked up at Zhou ziyue, “You have to break up, right?””

“Yes.”Zhou Ziyue nodded.

“”There’s no room for redemption,”Feng Yang continued to ask.”

“Zhou ziyue continued, “There’s no room.””

There’s no room for redemption.

“”Are you serious, or are you acting on Impulse?”Feng Yang paused, then, he said, “People will be very impulsive at a certain moment. It will be fine after this period of time. Why don’t we go back and calm down? If you still want to break up after the period of calm, I have no objections.””

“”There’s no need to calm down.”Zhou Ziyue looked at Feng Yang and said, “To tell you the truth, I have thought about these things for many days.””

“”Zhou Ziyue, we have been together for ten years! Not ten days!”Feng Yang could no longer control the anger in his heart. He threw the milk tea in his hand onto the ground. “Did you break up so easily?””

“”It is precisely because we have been together for ten years that we have achieved nothing in these ten years. That is why I want to break up!”In Love, it was either you who made me, or I who made you. But she and Feng Yang, she was an ordinary person, feng Yang was also an ordinary person. There was no one who made the other.”

“”Is that your real goal?”Feng Yang’s face was full of sadness, “Actually, I should have thought of it long ago. Your aunt isn’t an ordinary person. In fact, she didn’t look down on you at all. The real reason you didn’t let me go to your aunt’s house was because you wanted to break up with me, right?””

The capital was a bustling city. It was normal for young and beautiful girls to get lost here.

“However, Feng Yang was still a little unwilling.”

How could his girlfriend of ten years break up so easily? !

They were clearly at the stage where they were talking about marriage.

“”Yes.”Zhou Ziyue took a deep breath. “Since you already know, then I won’t hide it anymore. Your guess is right. Feng Yang, from today onwards, we are done. There will be no relationship anymore.””

“After saying this, Zhou Ziyue turned around and left.”

Feng Yang stood where he was.

“In a moment, he picked up the milk teacup on the ground, walked to the corner, and threw it into the trash can. Then, he squatted in the corner, covered his face, and wailed without caring about his image.”

“At this moment, the phone suddenly rang.”

Feng Yang took out his phone. It was his subordinate.

His subordinate must have something important to call him right now. Feng Yang immediately stopped crying and tried to pretend that nothing had happened. He picked up the phone. “Hello.”

“”Hello, President Feng. The first party said that there was a problem with the plan. Where are you now?””

“”Okay, I’ll be there at nine.””

“After hanging up the phone, Feng Yang didn’t have time to be sad. He immediately took a taxi back to the hotel.”

The biggest feature of Beijing was traffic jams. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“After half an hour of traffic jams, the car finally arrived at the entrance of the hotel.”

Feng Yang hurriedly got out of the car.

“At this moment, he hid his sadness in his heart and could no longer see any abnormalities.”

“After returning to his hotel room, he began to work busily.”

...

On the other side.

“After Zhou Ziyue returned to the Lin family, ye Sui immediately asked, “How was it? How was it? Did you explain everything clearly?””

“Yes.”Zhou Ziyue was very sad now.

She was even sadder than Feng Yang.

“These ten years, not only Feng Yang’s ten years, but also her ten years.”

“Ye Sui patted Zhou Ziyue’s shoulder. “Don’t be sad. After today, you will be above everyone else. No one can compare to you. Not just you. In the future, your children, your children’s children, will be above everyone else.””

“Zhou Ziyue took a deep breath and said with red eyes, “Mom, I want to calm down by myself.””

She didn’t even know why she had the courage to break up with Feng Yang today.

“She was so determined, so heartless.”

“Now, she felt a little regretful. She picked up her phone, opened wechat, and wanted to send a wechat message to Feng Yang.”

“What if after she broke up with Feng Yang, Ma Lu looked down on her again?”

“After all, Ma Lu didn’t even add her wechat.”

“Feng Yang was right. Sometimes, people were impulsive at a certain moment. After being impulsive, they would regret it.”

“What If Ma Lu didn’t want her? Based on her current situation, it would be difficult for her to find someone better than Feng Yang.”

“As she thought about it, Zhou Ziyue couldn’t help but open the dialogue box with Feng Yang.”

“At this moment, the wechat suddenly popped up with a friend request.”

It was Ma Lu!

“After the blind date that day, Ma Lu did not add Zhou Ziyue’s wechat in time.”

“Now, Ma Lu had finally applied.”

“Zhou Ziyue’s heart was quickly replaced by excitement. She clicked back and opened Feng Yang’s wechat. Then, she clicked delete and entered the blacklist.”

“From then on, she had nothing to do with Feng Yang anymore.”

“After deleting Feng Yang, Zhou Ziyue deleted Feng Yang’s circle of friends again. She changed the circle of friends that she had only seen for three days to one that could be seen at any time.”

“After confirming that there were no problems, Zhou Ziyue agreed to Ma Lu’s friend request.”

“Ye Sui looked at Zhou Ziyue’s expression and could not help but say, “Ziyue, you must not be muddle-headed again. Feng Yang doesn’t deserve you at all.””

“”Okay, I got it.”Zhou Ziyue nodded.”

“Hearing that, ye Sui said in surprise, “What did you say?””

“”I said I got it.”Zhou Ziyue looked up at Feng Yang. “Mom, I won’t have anything to do with Feng Yang anymore. Don’t worry.””

“”Really? Ziyue, have you really thought it through?”Ye Sui asked.”
