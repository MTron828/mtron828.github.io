“”Sister, don’t worry, I’ll definitely make her back down!”After saying this, man Wen turned around and left. ”

Man Xing chased after him. “Man Wen!”

“Man Wen ran very fast, and man Xing couldn’t catch up at all. Helpless, man Xing could only stop chasing and pick up the communicator to contact man Wen, “Man Wen, stop fooling around! Miss Ye is our elder sister, we should respect her and welcome her home. If you do this, you’ll make her sad!” ”

Man Wen did not listen to man Xing at all and directly cut off the connection.

Man Xing sighed and turned to look at his assistant. “My father must not know about this!”

“If man Jiangshan knew about this, man Wen would not be able to get out of bed for another half a month. ”

“Okay.”The assistant nodded and sighed in his heart. This pair of siblings really had a good relationship.

“Although Man Wen was a little profligate, he really didn’t have any objections to man Xing. ”

“However, it was also because man Xing was a good sister. ”

“From a young age, man xing had cleaned up countless messes for man Wen. ”

They had seen all of this.

Man Wen piloted the aircraft all the way to Chang Yue country.

“Chang Yue country was different from man Xing country. The streets were very lively because of the melon essence brought back by Ye Zhuo from Earth. After the cultivation was successful, the vendors were all scrambling to recommend the pineapple-flavored nutrient solution, the nutrient solution with the flavor of cantaloupe and the nutrient solution with the flavor of Kiwi. ”

The nutrient solution had a taste?

“Man Wen was a little curious. He went over and asked, “Boss, give me a dozen of each flavor of the nutrient solution.” ”

Give me a dozen!

What a rich young master!

“Under normal circumstances, everyone would buy the nutrient solution one by one. It was really rare to see people buy a dozen of them! ”

“”Okay! Sir, Please Wait a moment! It will be ready soon!” ”

“Soon, the boss put all kinds of nutrient fluids into the storage box and handed it to man Wen. “Sir, I don’t think you are from our country of changyue. Just give me 10 star dollars!” ”

Star dollars were the universal currency of the S Galaxy.

Man Wen naturally didn’t care about this little money. He immediately took out the money from his pocket. “Keep the change!”

“The boss took a look and saw that it was Ho! What a huge sum, a total of 50 star dollars. He quickly picked up the other nutrient fluids at the side and said, “Sir, sir, take this as a gift from me to you! “Come and take care of the store’s business in the future!” ”

Man Wen was too lazy to accept the gift and turned around to leave.

“The boss sighed and said, “As expected of a rich man. He doesn’t even like so many nutrient fluids!” ”

“As Man Wen walked, he took out a grape-flavored nutrient fluid and drank it. It was as if he had opened the door to a new world. ”

He had never known that nutrient fluids could be so delicious!

“Man Wen drank three bottles in a row. When he drank the fourth bottle, he finally felt that something was wrong. There was a child dressed in shabby clothes who kept staring at him. He kept swallowing his throat. It was obvious that he was hungry. ”

“Looking at his clothes, he should have escaped from another planet. ”

“Man Wen said with a face full of disdain, “What are you looking at! A wild child that no one wants! Only you deserve to drink nutrient fluids!” ”

The little boy looked at man Wen. His big eyes were full of desire. “Brother... I have been hungry for three days. Can you give me one? Just one!”

“Man Wen didn’t seem to have any sympathy at all. He said with a bad attitude, “You piece of trash. It’s a waste of resources to live. You might as well die!” ”

“Hearing that, the Little Boy’s eyes turned slightly red, and tears kept rolling in his eyes. ”

Man Wen turned around and left.

“Just as he turned around, the storage box on his body fell to the ground, and all kinds of nutrient fluids fell to the ground. Man Wen didn’t notice this scene. ” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“The little boy immediately walked forward and picked up the nutrient fluids that fell to the ground and put them back into the container. He caught up with man wen, “Big Brother, Big Brother, wait! You dropped something!” ”

“Man Wen turned around and frowned, “Things that have been touched by trash are also trash! I Don’t want the things anymore, so get lost right now!” ”

“The little boy immediately bent down and thanked man wen, “Thank You, Big Brother! Thank you, Big Brother! Big Brother, you’re really a good person!” ”

“”Scram, scram, scram! Get as far away from here as you can! Who’s your brother! Disgusting Thing!”Man Wen’s face was filled with disgust as he strode away. ”

“The little boy carried a box of nutrient solution with a smile on his face. He immediately turned around and ran away. As he ran, he said, “Grandma! Grandma! We have something to eat! We don’t have to die anymore!” ”

“In this era where the strong preyed on the weak, it was common for people to die. Now, they were finally able to keep their lives for the time being and did not have to die. ”
