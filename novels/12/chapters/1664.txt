Chapter 1665: 349: Miss Ye or Miss Ye! 2

Translator: 549690339

Ye Zhuo opened the cabin door and walked out of the spacecraft. She picked up the tools she brought with her and began to collect samples from the crater.

“She had limited time. In addition to collecting some special samples, she also needed to find volcanic crystals. ”

“Through studying volcanic crystals, she could completely suppress the problem of volcanic eruptions. ”

Only by suppressing the problem of volcanic eruptions could she make Mars an oasis.

“Before ye Zao came, he had checked the surrounding terrain very clearly, so it was relatively easy to find samples. ”

Bang —

“At this moment, an extinct volcano that was very close to ye Zao suddenly erupted. ”

“Ye Zao raised his eyes slightly, and a faint light flashed in his eyes. ”

It seemed that the time of the large-scale eruption was much earlier than she had estimated!

She still had to speed up!

“After collecting the samples here, ye Zao immediately piloted the aircraft and flew to the next crater. ”

“As soon as ye Zao sat in the aircraft, the surrounding extinct volcanoes spewed out lava one after another. ”

“Ye Zao activated the aircraft while looking out of the window, her beautiful brows slightly furrowed. ”

“According to the situation, she had to find the volcanic crystal within three minutes! ”

Ye Zao increased her speed.

The aircraft flew in the thick volcanic smoke.

“Not only was the volcanic smoke dense and low visibility, but there were also all kinds of harmful objects in the smoke. The slightest carelessness could endanger one’s life. ”

Ye Zao controlled the screen with one hand and put on the glasses with the other.

“The glasses looked no different from ordinary myopia glasses, but in fact, the material was special. Not only could they see through the thick smoke, but they could also find volcanic crystals in a volcano. ”

“After putting on the glasses, ye Zao quickly located the approximate location of the volcanic crystals in a group of volcanoes and pressed the button to land ” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Three seconds later, the aircraft successfully landed on the top of the volcano. ”

“According to the budget, the fire would erupt within five minutes, so ye Zao had to find the volcanic crystal within four minutes and drive the aircraft away. ”

Time passed by minute by minute.

Ye Zao held the detector and probed the specific location of the volcanic crystal bit by bit.

Di —

“At this moment, the detector rang, and the location of the volcanic crystal appeared on the detection screen. ”

Ye Zao immediately squatted down and took out the instrument to collect the volcanic crystal.

“The volcanic crystal was in a liquid state and its temperature was as high as 1,000 degrees Celsius. Only special containers could be used to install it. ”

Di —

It took exactly four minutes to collect the volcanic crystal!

Ye Zao did not stay any longer. He immediately brought the volcanic crystal back to the aircraft and prepared to leave.

At this moment.

Bang!

The surrounding volcanoes erupted. The originally quiet volcanic area instantly turned into a sea of fire!

It was extremely eye-catching.

“Because it was a large-scale eruption, even the ground began to shake. ”

The earth shook and the mountains shook!

“Even Cen Jiang, Yu Zifei, and the others who remained at the same spot also felt the tremors. ”

“Ma Fangfei was holding the camera and photographing the surface of Mars when she suddenly exclaimed, “Oh my God!” ”

“What’s Wrong?”Cen Jiang immediately asked.

“Ma Fangfei handed the camera to Cen Jiang. “CEN, Officer Cen, look at the Northwest District!” ”

“Cen Jiang took the camera and when he saw the scene over there, his expression immediately changed. ”

“In the meantime, the Northwest district was boiling with lava, like a purgatory on Earth. ”

“In the boiling lava, there was no sign of any aircraft. ”

“Erhe! Quickly contact Miss Ye!”

“Seeing Cen Jiang like this, Cen he did not dare to be careless and immediately picked up his communicator to contact ye Zao. ”

“Miss Ye!”

“Is Miss Ye There?”

“Miss Ye!”

“He called many times, but there was no response from ye Zao. ”

“Seeing this, Ma Fangfei quickly picked up her communicator and called Ye Zao. “Miss Ye, this is Ma Fangfei. Can You Hear Me?” ”

“Miss Ye! This is Cen Hai!”

“”Miss Ye, this is Cen Hu!” ”

“”Miss Ye, this is Yu Zifei!” ”

“For a moment, everyone on the aircraft carrier started calling ye Zao. ”

“However, there was still no response from ye Zao’s side. It was as if a stone had sunk into the ocean. ”

Ye Zao did not respond. Cen Jiang’s face was pale and his body was covered in cold sweat.

The northwest region was already covered in magma. Ye Zao’s side did not respond for a long time.

The result was already very obvious!

No.

It wouldn’t happen.

“Ye Zao was so powerful, nothing would happen to him. ”

Cen Jiang comforted himself in his heart.

“Other than being anxious, Cen Jiang was also regretting not following ye Zao, and even more regretting protecting ye Zao in times of danger. ”

“If anything really happened to Ye Zao, Cen Jiang would never forgive himself even if he died. ”
