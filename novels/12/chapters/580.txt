Lin Qingxuan mistakenly thought that his inability to have children had delayed Zhao shuning. He felt guilty for most of his life.

Zhao shuning had been worried for most of his life because he was afraid that the matter would be exposed.

“Lin Jincheng nodded. “I hope that in the next few days, fourth brother will be able to find his own happiness.” ”

“He will definitely find it.”

“The Lin family’s genes were very good. The five brothers all looked great. Although Lin Qingxuan was over 40 years old, he could not tell his actual age. As long as he was willing, he was not afraid of not finding a suitable person. ”

The next morning.

Ye Zhuo finished his breakfast and went to school with Lin Ze.

“Lin Jincheng took the car keys. “Zhuo Zhuo, Ah Ze, let me send you over.” ” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Ye Shu stood up and said, “Don’t you have to go to work? I’ll send you there.” ”

“Lin Jincheng smiled and said, “There’s nothing to do if I’m late today.” ”

“”Alright, you can go.” ”

The two siblings followed Lin Jincheng out.

“Although Lin Jincheng had a prosthetic leg, it didn’t affect his driving. ”

The two siblings sat in the backseat.

“Lin Ze said, “Zhuozhuo, are you free in the afternoon?” ”

“”I might not be free this afternoon. I have an appointment with someone.”Ye Zhonghua continued, “Brother, what’s the matter?” ”

“Lin Ze said, “Nothing much. I’m just asking.” ”

“OH.”Ye Zhonghua nodded. He took out a piece of candy from his pocket and handed it to Lin Ze.

Lin Ze reached out and took it.

Lin Jincheng saw this scene through the rearview mirror. He could not help but smile.

One had to know that Lin ze used to hate eating these sweets.

“Isn’t it delicious?”Ye Zhuo turned to look at Lin Ze.

“It’s Delicious.”Lin Ze nodded.

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “I changed a brand today. It was recommended by the netizens. I also think that this brand tastes pretty good. Looks like heroes think alike!” ”

“After a while, they arrived at Beijing University. ”

The two of them got off the car together.

Lin Ze sent ye Zao to the dormitory building.

“The campus Belle and Campus Belle walked together. Along the way, they attracted countless gazes. ”

“Ye Zao had just entered the dormitory when he was pulled back by Li Yueyue. “Da Zao Zao! I just saw that the campus Belle sent you to the dormitory building! Tell me honestly, what is your relationship with the campus Belle!” ”

“Speaking up to this point, Li Yueyue narrowed her eyes. “The campus Belle can’t be your boyfriend, right?” ”

Ye Zhuo reached out and knocked on Li Yueyue’s head. “What are you thinking about! He’s my brother!”

Brother?

“Li Yueyue was stunned. “That can’t be right! Zhuozhuo, didn’t you say that your mother only has you as her child?” ”

“It’s a little complicated.”Ye Zhuo picked up the book on the table. “Class is about to start. Let’s talk as we walk.”

“Okay.”

“On the way, Ye Zao briefly told her about Lin Ze’s matter. ”

“Li Yueyue was extremely surprised. “So, the school Belle is really your brother?” ”

“It’s true.”

“Li Yueyue sighed. “Then your family’s genes are too good! A school Belle, a school Belle, a scholar, and a top scorer! Amazing! Really Amazing! No wonder everyone says that we’re not a family!” ”

“After saying that, Li Yueyue continued, “Da Zao, does your brother have a girlfriend?” ”

“Ye Zao Thought for a moment and said, “I don’t think so.” ”

Li Yueyue’s eyes lit up. “Then I’ll introduce him to someone! I have a junior high school classmate right next door in Qinghua! She likes your brother very much!”

“Ye Zao originally thought that Li Yueyue would volunteer. After all, Peking University had a bunch of Lin Ze’s fangirls. ”

He did not expect that Li Yueyue would be interested in being a matchmaker.

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Then I’ll ask my brother later. If he has such intentions, I’ll give you his wechat.” ”

“”Okay, okay!”Li Yueyue hurriedly nodded. “Then don’t Forget!” ”

“”Don’t worry, I Won’t forget.” ”

“Li Yueyue continued, “Oh Right, Zao Zao, I heard that our school has a YC science and Technology Award. If you can enter the top three in the competition, not only will you be able to join the science and technology industry, but you’ll also receive a large sum of money! “When the time comes, Professor Niu Hulu, who won first place in the science and Technology Conference last year, will personally present the award. Do you want to sign up?” ”

Niu Hulu YC had made important achievements in the science and technology industry and had already left the industry.

All the students from the Beijing University of Science and Technology were Niu Hulu’s fans.

“Although Li Yueyue was not from the science and Technology Academy, she had heard of Niu Hulu’s name. ”

Ye Zhuo shook his head. “I won’t sign up.”

How could there be a reason for him to create an award and sign up himself?

“Li Yueyue continued, “Actually, I really wanted to sign up, but unfortunately, I don’t have the ability! I heard from Bai Xiaoman that Feng Xianxian seems to have signed up! She’s quite confident in herself!” ”
