“If it wasn’t for her, Zhou Xiang wouldn’t be where she is today? ”

She was an ingrate.

Xie wanqiu felt a chill in her heart. It was so uncomfortable that she couldn’t breathe.

“Grandma.”Zheng Wanyin walked up the stairs.

“”Yinyin.”Seeing Zheng Wanyin, Xie wanqiu felt much better. ”

“Zheng Wanyin walked over and held Xie Wanqiu’s arm. She said gently, “Grandma, we’ve already disturbed second aunt for so long. Should we go back?” ”

Disturbed?

She came to her daughter’s house. How could she be considered to be disturbed!

“Did Zhou Xiang say something in front of you? Did he make you suffer?”Xie wanqiu looked at Zheng Wanyin.

“”No, no.”Zheng wanyin smiled and said, “Second aunt is very good to me. Why would she make me suffer? I just feel that we’ve already disturbed second aunt for so long. It’s time to go home.” ”

“Xie wanqiu said, “This is my daughter’s house. I can stay here as long as I Want!” ”

“Zheng Wanyin supported Xie wanqiu down the stairs and said in a low voice, “But second aunt already has her own family. It’s not good for us to keep disturbing her here. Didn’t you notice a problem?” ”

“What problem?”Xie wanqiu asked.

“Zheng wanyin continued, “Ever since we moved in, cousin didn’t even show his face.” ”

“Xie wanqiu patted Zheng Wanyin’s hand and said with a smile, “I’ve already asked Zhou Xiang. He said that Shaoqing is having a meeting overseas and should be back in a few days!” ”

No matter how powerful CEN Shaoqing was.

“Whether or not the CEN family was the number one family in Huaxia, she was still Cen Shaoqing’s grandmother. ”

Cen Shaoqing was a junior in front of her!

“Zheng Wanyin nodded. “I see.”After saying that, Zheng wanyin continued, “But grandmother, we’ve already stayed at home for a week. Why don’t we wait for cousin to come back and leave? I’m already homesick!” ”

“”You Child, How Old Are You? Why are you still homesick? Besides, you’ll get married sooner or later. You’ll have to get used to it in advance!” ”

“Zheng Wanyin leaned her head on Xie Wanqiu’s shoulder and began to act coquettishly. “Grandma, I’ll never get married in my life! I want to be with you!” ”

Xie wanqiu liked to hear such words.

“She had five granddaughters, but none of the others were as pleasing to her as Zheng Wanyin was. ” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

None of the four daughters that Zhou Xiang raised took her seriously.

She had been here for so many days!

“None of the four sisters, Cen Yuying, Cen Yueya, Cen Yueying, and Cen Yuyan, showed up. ”

“As long as she thought of the four of them, Xie Wanqiu’s eyes were filled with disgust. How could they be as likable as Zheng Wanyin, her biological granddaughter. ”

“Xie wanqiu continued, “Silly girl! How many girls don’t want to marry?” ”

“Zheng wanyin continued, “I don’t want to. In any case, I don’t want to marry! I just want to accompany you!” ”

“”Don’t worry. Grandma will definitely find an excellent husband for you in the capital.”Xie wanqiu patted Zheng Wanyin’s head. “My Yinyin either doesn’t want to marry, or she will marry a real dragon among men!” ”

“Zheng wanyin joked, “In the entire capital, other than cousin, who else can be called a dragon and Phoenix among men?” ”

“”Yinyin has a good eye,”Xie Wanqiu praised. ”

“Zheng wanyin said, “Grandma, don’t joke around. I was just saying it casually.” ”

Xie Wanqiu didn’t say anything.

On the other side.

Zhou Xiang sent old Mrs. Cen to the bedroom.

“Old Mrs. Cen said, “Can’t you be a little tougher in front of your stepmother?” ”

“Zhou Xiang brewed a cup of camel milk for old Mrs. Cen. “She’s still an elder after all, and she’s already so old. Even my father can’t do anything to her. As a junior, I can’t Say Anything More!” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen took the cup. “Fortunately, I’m not a wicked old woman. If I were a wicked old woman, you would have been tortured to death by me long ago!” ”

“Zhou Xiang held old Mrs. Cen’s arm. “Then, am I not called a fool who has good fortune?” ”

Old Mrs. Cen laughed out loud at Zhou Xiang’s teasing.

“After finishing the camel milk, old Mrs. Cen continued, “I think your stepmother must have come with a purpose this time. You have to be careful. Don’t fall into her trap!” ”

“Okay.”Zhou Xiang nodded.

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “If she bullies you again, get someone to look for me. I’ll support you!” ”

Zhou Xiang continued to nod.

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Your stepmother is 15 years younger than me! If I leave in the future, what will you do?” ”

“”Mom, what are you talking about!” ”
