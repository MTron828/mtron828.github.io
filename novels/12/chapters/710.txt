“Chapter 711: 159: a Big Show, slapping song Chenyu in the face! 6”

Translator: 549690339

Cen yueying only dared to slap Cen Shaoqing in front of ye Zao when he was around.

“If ye Zao was not around, she would not dare to call Cen Shaoqing the fifth girl. ”

“Then I have to eat more. I Can’t let the fifth girl down.”Ye Zao teased Cen Shaoqing with Cen Yueying.

Cen Shaoqing:”...”the fifth girl was a bad joke.

“CEN yueying continued, “After eating the pineapple, there are still cherries. This cherries was also bought by the fifth girl.” ”

“At this moment, Cen Yueya looked at ye Zao and said with some surprise, “Zao Zao, are you wearing the latest model of ZY Technology?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“CEN Yueya continued, “I have also been eyeing their new model for a long time. Unfortunately, my hand speed is still a little slow.” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Second sister, if you like it, you can tell me. Next time, I’ll help you snatch it for you.” ”

“”Really?”Cen Yueya’s eyes lit up. She was also a designer, so Cen Yueya really liked Z’s works. Unfortunately, the clothes that z personally designed were all limited edition. ”

It was impossible to snatch them if they were not the chosen ones. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Other than the limited edition that ye Zao gave her last time, the others were all normal editions. ”

Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Of course it’s true.”

“CEN yueying said, “Zao Zao, you can’t favor one over the other. Other than second sister, I also like ZY’s limited edition.” ”

“”And me!”Cen Yuying, who had always been very generous, also raised her hand. ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “I’m very familiar with ZY’s designers. Eldest sister, second sister, and third sister, if you guys have any styles that you like in the future, just send them to me directly. I’ll help you guys settle it!” ”

“Really?”The three of them were especially excited.

Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Of course it’s true.”

“Hearing this, Cen Yuyan raised her head and looked at ye Zao. ”

She was also a loyal fan of ZY technology.

“When ye Zao called the other three sisters, he didn’t even call her. ”

He was really too insensible.

“At this moment, CEN Yuyan remembered that song Chenyu had used her phone to add ye Zao’s wechat. ”

“Later on, she forgot about this matter. ”

Did Ye Zao agree to be friends with her?

Cen Yuyan quickly took out her phone and saw ye Zao’s wechat in her contact list.

“At this moment, CEN Yuyan received a wechat message from song Chenyu. ”

“Cen Yuyan then remembered something more important, she stood up and said, “Eldest sister, second sister, third sister, Shaoqing, Zao Zao, the few of us are quite bored at home. Why don’t we go out for a walk? I know a club with a lot of entertainment facilities.” ”

“”Sure! I also feel that it’s quite boring at home,”Cen Yueying stood up and said. ”

Cen Yueya and Cen Yuying also expressed their agreement.

Cen Shaoqing turned to look at Ye Zhuoluo.

“Ye zhuoluo smiled and said, “I don’t have a problem with that either.” ”

Old Madam Cen came down from upstairs. “Where Are you guys going? I want to go too!”

“Ye Zhuoluo walked over and held old Madam Cen’s arm. “Grandma Cen, then let’s go quickly.” ”

“En!”Old Mrs. Cen nodded and held ye Zhuo’s hand. “We two little girls will go together and ignore them.”

Ye Zhuo smiled.

“Zhou Xiang stood up and said, “Then I’ll go along and join in the fun.” ”

Cen Yuyan didn’t expect the entire family to go together.

But it was better this way.

“It just so happened that the family didn’t understand song Chenyu, so they could take advantage of this opportunity to let everyone see a talented and beautiful song Chenyu. ”

“Cen Yuyan took out her phone and sent a wechat message to song Chenyu. [ Chenyu, my grandma and my mom are coming too. ] ”

“On the other end of the screen, when Song Chenyu saw this message, the corner of her mouth curled up slightly. She replied, [ Okay. ] ”

Okay.

This was really great.

“This time, she wanted to get back all the face she had lost in front of Ye Zhuo! ”

“For today, song Chenyu even invited Li Shang. ”

Who Was Li Shang?

“The CEO of Xing Tianxia Media Co. , Ltd. . He was also ye Zao’s immediate superior. ”

Song Chenyu still did not believe that ye Zao was a phd in Science and technology.

How Old was ye Zao?

“Ye Zao was 19 last year, and he was only 20 this year after the New Year. ”

Which of those phd’s were not in their early 40s?

What right did ye Zao have?

“Other than being an anchor and relying on her face to make a living, what else could she rely on? ”

The Cen family was the number one family in Huaxia.

Old Mrs. Cen and Zhou Xiang were both from prestigious families.

Would they tolerate their daughter-in-law being a small live streamer?

“Therefore, she wanted to expose ye Zao’s true identity in front of the Cen family! ”

“In addition to exposing the truth in front of the Cen family, she also wanted to indirectly remind ye Zao not to try to compete with her. ”

Ye Zao was not from the same world as her.

How could a live streamer compete with a celebrity?

“The people she interacted with were all big shots. She could sit at the same table as the world-famous CEO, Li Shang, and drink tea. Could Ye Zao do it? ”

“On the other side, the CEN family sat on the extended version of Lincoln and came to the club that Cen Yuyan was talking about. ”

This was a membership club.

“There were all kinds of food, drinks, and entertainment. ”

“Cen Yuyan smiled and said, “My friend has already booked a room upstairs. We can just go over directly.” ”

Friend?

Old Mrs. Cen’s eyebrows jumped subconsciously.

Could it be that this friend that was so stupid was song Chenyu?

“It was the new year, what was Cen Yuyan trying to do? ”

Old Mrs. Cen frowned without a trace.

“As soon as she came upstairs, song Chenyu walked out. “Yuyan, you’re here.” ”

“Chenyu.”

“Song Chenyu greeted the others again. “Auntie, Old Madam, the two of you are here too.” ”

“When Old Madam Cen saw song Chenyu, her displeasure was written all over her face. ”

She really did not expect Cen Yuyan to be so stupid to this extent.

She could really infuriate people to death!

“Fortunately, ye Zao did not have a weak character. Otherwise, he would have been dragged down to death by her. ”

“Song Chenyu then greeted the Cen family’s sisters, then, he said, “Cen Fifth Master and Miss Ye are also here. Please come in quickly. I didn’t know that you were coming just now, so I invited a few guests as well. Please don’t mind.” ”

“Cen Yuyan smiled and said, “What’s there to mind? It’s only lively when there are more people. Besides, we came uninvited. Chenyu, it’s good that you don’t mind.” ”

The few of them came inside.

Everyone was a little surprised when they saw the CEN family members. They thought that they were hallucinating.

Cen family members?

CEN fifth master?

“Song Chenyu turned to look at Ye Zhuo, he smiled and said, “Miss Ye, it’s a coincidence. Today, I also invited CEO Li. I heard that you just signed a contract with CEO Li’s world-traversing company not long ago. Come, let me introduce you. This is CEO Li.” ”

A small live streamer like ye Zhuo definitely did not have the qualifications to meet Li Shang.

“After saying that, song chenyu continued, “CEO Li, this is Miss Ye. She’s also a live streamer that your company has just signed a contract with. Miss Ye and I are very good friends. I hope that CEO Li can take care of Miss Ye at work.” ”

“Li Shang looked at Ye Zhuo. “Ye, CEO Ye?” ”
