“An! Is That You?”

Ye Zao looked back slightly and saw a young man with blond hair and blue eyes. “Carl?”

Carl immediately ran to Ye Zao’s side. “It’s really you!”

Ye Zao adjusted his sunglasses. “Has it started inside?”

“It’s about time. Let’s go in quickly.”

“Okay.”Ye Zao nodded.

“Although Ranito was in C nation, because of its popularity, people from all over the world were gathered here. ”

Ye Zao changed all the money in his card into chips.

“After changing the chips, he followed Carl to the competition zone. ”

“This afternoon, there was a competition between C Nation’s King of gamblers and L Nation. At this time, the competition zone was full of people. ”

It was almost impossible to get a single vote.

The battle between the two kings made the spectators especially excited.

Ye Zhuo and Carl walked to the corresponding seats. The staff gave them a number plate.

Everyone could place their bets with the number plate.

“Carl turned to look at Ye Zhuo. “An, who do you think will win?” ”

Ye Zhuo looked at the stage. “Place your bets on Hibbert.”

“Hibbert was the new gambling king of country L. Although his strength was not bad, it was obvious that he was not up to par in this round of PK. ”

“Therefore, in this round, everyone placed their bets on China’s gambling king, Mandel. ”

“Hearing this answer, Carl said in surprise, “An, are you sure?” ”

Ye Zao picked up all the chips and handed them to Carl. “Place your bets on Hibbert.”

Carl gulped. “Okay.”

“Mandel! Mandel!”

“Come on!”

The audience below the stage were shouting Hibbert’s name.

“The host was holding a microphone, and the expression on his face was especially excited, “Between the two gambling kings, who is the final winner?”? Judging from the cheers from the audience, it was obvious that Mandel was better! Then, could our country’s new king of gamblers turn defeat into victory? Oh! Oh My God! Hibbert called the bet! He called the bet! Our Mandel also called the bet! Success or failure depends on this one move!” ”

Mandel looked at Hibbert without any special expression on his face.

This round.

He was going to win for sure!

“After the last card was dealt, the competition reached its most tense moment. The host held the microphone tightly and said, “Now, the two king of Gamblers, please open your cards one by one!” ”

Mandel turned over his cards calmly.

“The host exclaimed in surprise, “Straight! Mandel is a Straight! What’s looking at Hibbert? Oh My God! Hibbert is actually a flush! Congratulations to the gambling king of Country L, Hibbert!” ”

The audience immediately exploded.

Who would have thought that Mandel would actually lose!

“After all, Mandel had been the gambling king for ten years. ”

“Hibbert! Hibbert!”

Everyone below the stage was shouting Hibbert’s name. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Hibbert calmly waved at everyone.

“Carl turned to look at Ye Zhuo. “An, how did you know that Hibbert would win?”Under the circumstances just now, almost no one thought that Hibbert would win, but ye Zhuo firmly believed in Hibbert. ”

“Ye Zhuo pushed up his sunglasses. “There’s an old saying in China, ‘a pot of water doesn’t make a sound, but half the pot of water jingles.'” ”

“Although Mandel was a powerful gambling king, he was too confident. ”

Excessive confidence would turn into conceit.

“That way, he did not put Hibbert in his eyes at all. ”

Little did he know that Hibbert had already killed people invisibly.

“”OH.”Carl nodded, not fully understanding, and then asked, “Who should I choose next?” ”

“Choose me.”

“Before Carl could react, ye Zao pressed the challenge button on his seat and slowly stood up. ”

“She was wearing sunglasses and a hat on her head. Although her face could not be seen clearly, her imposing manner could not be ignored. ”

“In all the previous king of Gamblers’competitions, there had never been an audience who issued a challenge to the winner. ”

This was the first time.

“If the ordinary people issued a challenge to the king of Gamblers, wouldn’t that be asking for a beating? ”

It could also be that people were stupid and had a lot of money!

“Not only the audience below the stage, but even the host was stunned. After a long time, he finally reacted and reminded, “That lady, you just pressed the challenge button.” ”

“”Yes, I know.”Ye Zhuo’s tone was shallow. ”

“The host gulped. “You mean, you want to challenge the King of Gamblers, Hibbert?” ”

“”Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly, picked up the chip box on the table, and walked up to the stage. ”

Hibbert glanced at Ye Zhuo. “Are You Chinese?”

The host was stunned.

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo opened the box and poured all the chips inside onto the table.

Crash.

All the chips were worth five digits.

“Seeing that ye Zhuo was not joking, the host announced the rules of the competition. “Are the two of you ready?” ”
