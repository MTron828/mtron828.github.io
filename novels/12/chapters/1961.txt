“Xu Yao said, “After giving Ziteng medicine, Mi Chen went back. ”

Xu Yao’s words didn’t sound suspicious at all.

“Mother he nodded and continued, “Doctor Mi is a very good young man. I don’t know if Ziteng told you that he saved me before.” ”

“”I heard from Ziteng.”Xu Yao continued, “Actually, I’m quite close to Mi Chen. Previously, Ziteng often invited doctor mi over to our house to play.” ”

Mother he nodded.

“Father he continued, “I’ve told Doctor Zhu that he and Mi Chen will help Ziteng prepare medicine together in the future.” ”

“Mother he said, “Mmm, with doctor mi around, it will make people feel more at ease.” ”

“At that moment, he ziteng only wanted to open his eyes immediately and tell his parents in person about Xu Yao and Mi Chen’s true colors. ”

They were a pair of adulterous couples.

He ziteng felt very uncomfortable and began to understand his parents’feelings of not letting him be with Xu Yao at that time.

“When he thought of his mother’s heartache at that time, he ziteng felt even more uncomfortable. ”

He regretted it.

He really regretted it.

He regretted why he did that.

He regretted that he was blind.

At the same time.

He also prayed in his heart.

He prayed that ye Zao would come back soon.

Ye Zao would definitely have a way to save her.

He could not stand Xu Yao acting in front of his parents in front of him to gain their trust.

“At this moment, mother he seemed to have thought of something. She took out a piece of clothing from her bag. “Yaoyao.” ”

“”What is it, Auntie?”Xu Yao looked at mother he. ”

“Mother he continued, “Yaoyao, this is the radiation-proof clothing I bought for you. I heard that the radiation is very serious now, especially in the hospital. This is very bad for the baby. Quickly take it and try it out to see if it fits.” ”

“”Thank you, Auntie.”Xu Yao took the clothes with both hands and smiled. “The clothes that Auntie bought with her own hands will definitely fit.” ”

“”Go and try them on first,”mother he said. ”

Xu Yao nodded and took the clothes to the bathroom to change.

“Seeing Xu Yao’s figure disappear in the direction of the bathroom, mother he sighed, “When Ziteng was fine, I always opposed him and Yaoyao. I don’t know why, but at that time, I had such a deep prejudice against yaoyao! “If I had agreed to let them be together at that time, perhaps this wouldn’t have happened.” ”

“When she said the last sentence, his mother’s words were already filled with a heavy sobbing tone. ”

She was very regretful.

She regretted not fulfilling this pair of bitter lovers earlier.

“But things had come to this point, what was the use of regretting? ”

“Hearing these words, he ziteng was extremely anxious. ”

No.

No.

This wasn’t his mother’s fault.

All of this had nothing to do with his mother.

This was all his own fault. He did not see through Xu Yao’s false feelings and malicious heart.

“From the beginning, when his mother said that Xu Yao was dishonest, he should have seen through something. ”

“But, he did not. ”

He did not see anything.

He was like a fool.

A fool.

“Now that he thought about it, Xu Yao at that time was simply full of doubts. ”

“If she really knew how to make pastries, why would she hurt her palm? ”

There was clearly something wrong with this!

“Father Xu patted mother Xu on the shoulder, “Xunfang, this has nothing to do with you. Everyone makes mistakes. “It’s not just you. I didn’t agree to let them be together either. Maybe this is our Ziteng’s fate. Don’t think too much. Even if Ziteng really doesn’t wake up in the future, don’t we still have Yaoyao and the unborn child?” ”

“Speaking up to this point, father xu paused before continuing, “From now on, Yaoyao will be our biological daughter.” ”

“Yes.”Mother he nodded.

She had the same thoughts as father he.

If he ziteng really didn’t wake up.

“From now on, Xu Yao would be their biological daughter. ”

Biological Daughter?

“Did their parents want to treat Xu Yao, this poisonous snake, as their biological daughter? ”

No.

No!

Xu Yao would kill her parents.

“He ziteng tried hard to open his mouth, ”

but he just couldn’t.

“Mother he continued, “For the sake of our family, Yaoyao has caused such a ruckus with her parents. I hope that after the baby is born, Yaoyao’s parents will forgive her.” ”

“Father he patted mother he’s hand and sighed. “They will, they definitely will. Yaoyao is so good, and her parents aren’t unreasonable people. They will definitely forgive Yaoyao.” ”

“At that moment, Xu Yao came out of the bathroom. She had already changed into a white radiation-proof maternity outfit and walked around in front of the He family’s parents. “Uncle, Auntie, do you think this maternity outfit Will Fit Me?” ”

Xu Yao was only two and a half months pregnant. It was not suitable at all.

“Mother he smiled and said, “It’s suitable, it’s very suitable. Not only is it suitable, but it’s also very beautiful.” ”

“Xu Yao said, “This is all because of Auntie’s good taste.” ”

“Mother he held Xu Yao’s hand. “Yaoyao, the months in the future will become more and more difficult. Do you really not regret it?” ”

Xu Yao nodded firmly. “I don’t regret it. I will never regret it.”

“”Good child. Thank you,”mother he said emotionally. ”

“Xu Yao smiled slightly, “Auntie, you don’t have to thank me. I’m Ziteng’s girlfriend. I said that I would advance and retreat together with Ziteng. Now that Ziteng is in trouble, if I listen to my parents and ignore ziteng, then I’m no different from an animal!” ”

Pretending!

Xu Yao was too good at pretending.

“If he hadn’t heard the conversation between Xu Yao and Mi Chen, he ziteng would have been deceived by Xu Yao now. ”

He had never known that Xu Yao was so good at acting.

Her words touched his heart.

Mother he hugged Xu Yao with great emotion.

On the other side.

At the Xu family home.

“Because of he ziteng’s accident, the Xu family’s parents were very happy during this period of time. ”

Especially after they learned that he ziteng would never wake up.

“Before Xu Chaonan entered the door, he heard laughter from inside. He lifted his feet and walked in. It was rare that Father Xu did not go out to play mahjong today. ”

“Thinking of the news about the he corporation, Xu Chaonan stopped in his tracks and looked at Father Xu. “Brother.” ”

“What’s Wrong?”Father Xu turned to look at Xu Chaonan.

“Xu Chaonan continued, “I heard that he ziteng got into a car accident. Is that true?” ”

“It’s true.”Father Xu nodded.

“Xu Chaonan asked, “Then is it true that Yaoyao is pregnant?” ”

“When he heard the news, Xu Chaonan naturally did not believe it. ”

Because Xu Yao was not the kind of girl who got pregnant before marriage.

She knew how to protect herself.

But now.

“After seeing her brother and sister-in-law like this, she was not so confident anymore. ”

Father Xu continued to nod. “It’s also true.”

PA!

The document in Xu Chaonan’s hand fell to the ground.

“Being pregnant out of wedlock might not be a big deal in modern society, but to Xu Chaonan, it was intolerable. ”

That was because she was a very conservative woman.

“She had never had sex with anyone, so naturally, she could not tolerate her niece being so self-deprecating. ”

“More importantly, he ziteng was very likely to become a vegetable in the future. ”

Xu Yao being pregnant at this juncture was also extremely irresponsible to herself!

She was still young.

Was she going to carry the child and live a widow’s life in the future?

“Seeing Xu Chaonan like this, father Xu curled the corners of his lips and continued, “Chaonan, it’s a good thing that your niece is pregnant. This means that our old xu family is going to have an additional child soon.” ”

“Yaoyao is going to give birth to that child?”Xu Chaonan frowned slightly.

“Yes.”Father Xu nodded.

“Ridiculous!” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Mother Xu sneered and said sarcastically, “Some people don’t know how to give birth, but they still want to stop others from giving birth. How Ridiculous!” ”

How could there be such an aunt in the world!

“Fortunately, Xu Yao did her best. Otherwise, she would have to live under Xu Chaonan’s control for the rest of her life. ”

“Xu Chaonan tried his best to control his temper. He turned to look at mother Xu and continued, “Sister-in-law, this child really can’t be given birth! Yaoyao is still young. This child will ruin her life!” ”

Raising a child was not like raising a small pet.

You have to be responsible for him!

“His mother said, “Yaoyao can decide whether she wants this child or not. After all, she is already an adult now.” ”

“Although his mother did not say it explicitly, her words were clearly mocking Xu Chaonan for meddling in other people’s business. ”

Their parents had not objected yet.

How could Xu Chaonan have the right to speak!

“Xu Chaonan wasn’t a fool. Naturally, he could understand the hidden sarcasm in her words and didn’t continue speaking. ”

“Brother and sister-in-law had always been like this, putting interests first in everything. ”

“Now that he zideng was in trouble, and Xu Yao was pregnant with the only child of the He family, as long as Xu Yao gave birth to the child, she would be able to inherit the he family’s inheritance in the future. ”

She had to personally find Xu Yao to explain it to her.

“As an aunt, Xu Yao was the one who had watched the child grow up. She really could not watch Xu Yao sink deeper and deeper! ”

Xu Chaonan went straight to the hospital.

“After getting the room number of He ziteng’s ward from the nurse, he knocked on the door. ”

“Very quickly, the door opened from the inside. ”

The person who opened the door was Xu Yao.

“When she saw Xu Chaonan, Xu Yao was stunned. “Auntie.” ”

Xu Chaonan nodded.

“Xu Yao continued, “Auntie, please come in.” ”

“Xu Chaonan followed her in. Xu Yao introduced her to the He family’s parents in the room. “Uncle, Auntie, this is my aunt, Xu Chaonan.” ”
