“Jiang Xiaoyu continued to ask, “The Miss Sun You mentioned just now is Sun Yiran?” ”

“The assistant nodded. “It’s Sun Yiran, Miss Sun!” ”

“Jiang Xiaoyu stood up and said, “She even dares to drive Sun Yiran? Xueyin, is this true?”Sun Yiran was elder Sun’s granddaughter. Before Jiang Xiaoyu went abroad, she had a good relationship with Sun Yiran. ”

“Zhao xueyin nodded and said, “It’s true.” ”

“”Too much! This is too much!”Jiang Xiaoyu was very angry. “Xueyin, just you wait! I’ll find a way to avenge you tonight!” ”

“”Xiaoyu, don’t be too impulsive!”Zhao Xueyin immediately stood up and held Jiang Xiaoyu’s hand. ”

“Jiang Xiaoyu frowned helplessly. “You’re just too easy to talk to! You’re a pushover. If ye Zhuo doesn’t bully someone like you, who else would he bully?” ”

“”She didn’t bully me.”Zhao xueyin smiled and said, “Actually, I quite understand her. After all, she and I are competitors. It’s normal for her to act like this! Just like how I also want to kick her out of the Shunxi Financial Group.” ”

“”That’s different!”Jiang Xiaoyu said, “The Shunxi Financial Group originally belonged to you! Ye Zhuo stole your things, so of course you want to kick her out! But now, the person who stole your things is actually still bullying you!” ”

“In Jiang Xiaoyu’s opinion, it was ye Zao who took Zhao Xueyin’s things! ”

Because the Shunxi Financial Group was Zhao Xueyin’s to begin with.

“Ye Zao didn’t give anything, yet he wanted to take something for nothing? ”

There was such a good thing in this world!

It would have been fine if ye Zao had kept a low profile.

“However, ye Zao didn’t even know that he had taken someone else’s things! ”

This worldview!

It was really crooked!

Jiang Xiaoyu hated people who stole other people’s things the most!

It was simply disgusting! Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Zhao Xueyin sighed. “Actually, I don’t blame anyone. If you want to blame someone, blame yourself for not having a good great-great-grandfather like ye Zao.” ”

“In the end, ye Zao still took advantage of the dead. ”

“If it wasn’t for elder Ye, would ye Zao be where he is now? ”

“Seeing Zhao Xueyin like this, Jiang Xiaoyu felt a little uncomfortable. ”

“In her impression, Zhao Xueyin was very confident! ”

When had she ever been so wronged?

“Jiang Xiaoyu held Zhao Xueyin’s hand. “Xueyin, what are you talking about! It’s not your fault! Although you don’t have a backer, you can rely on yourself! You’re so outstanding, I think that ye Zao can’t even compare to your little finger!” ”

“Zhao xueyin smiled and said, “You’re the only one who can comfort me.” ”

“”I’m serious.”Jiang Xiaoyu hugged Zhao Xueyin and continued, “Xueyin, in my heart, you’ve always been the most outstanding person!” ”

“”Thank you.”Zhao Xueyin hugged Jiang Xiaoyu tightly, and a faint smile appeared on the corner of her mouth. ”

“A moment later, Jiang Xiaoyu let go of Zhao Xueyin and said, “I suddenly remembered that I have other things to do. Xueyin, wait for me here for a while. I’ll be back soon.” ”

“In fact, she was going to find ye Zao. ”

She wanted to see if ye Zao really had three heads and six arms!

Jiang Xiaoyu had never been afraid of anyone in her entire life.

“Zhao Xueyin naturally knew Jiang Xiaoyu’s real purpose, so she didn’t expose it. She smiled and said, “Okay, I’ll wait for you here.” ”

“Watching Jiang Xiaoyu’s back disappear into the crowd in front of her, Zhao Xueyin looked up at her assistant and said, “You did a good job. You’re good at Reading People’s expressions. Your salary this month will be doubled.” ”

“”Thank you, Miss Zhao!”The assistant bowed and thanked her. “Don’t worry, Miss Zhao. I’ll keep up the good work!” ”

Zhao Xueyin nodded in satisfaction.

In the dessert area.

Ye Zhuo sat there and ate five desserts in a row.

This dessert master was worthy of being invited by the elders to visit the thatched cottage three times.

Her cooking skills were indeed very good.

It was one of the few desserts that ye Zhuo had eaten that were the most delicious.

She was very serious when she ate. Even the tiny bit of cream on her plate had to be scraped clean with a spoon. She would not waste any of it.

“Just as ye Zhuo was eating happily, an old voice suddenly sounded in the air. “Miss Ye.” ”

“Ye Zhuo looked back slightly. When she saw who it was, she immediately stood up from her chair. “Granny Zhou.” ”

Granny Zhou and Old Ye were seniors of the same generation.

He was already in his eighties this year. He had a head full of gorgeous hair and looked very kind.

Perhaps it had something to do with his early experiences. Ye Zhuo really liked interacting with these old people.

“Granny Zhou chuckled and said, “It’s too quiet here. Why doesn’t miss ye spend more time with the young people?” ”

“Young people nowadays were afraid of being fat. In order to maintain their figure, there were very few who liked to eat desserts. ”

“Even if they like it, they have to endure it. ”

“So, most people come over just to take a picture, and then they leave. ”
