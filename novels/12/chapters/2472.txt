Translator: 549690339

Useful?

Useless!

“If it had been someone else, it might have been useful. ”

But song Shiyu was an ingrate.

Old Master Chen finally saw song Shiyu clearly now. He even started to regret not saving song Shiyu back then.

“If he hadn’t meddled in other people’s business back then, there wouldn’t be so much trouble now! ”

It was all his fault!

“Chen Siyao didn’t think so, she continued, “Grandpa, Shi Yu isn’t such a heartless person. It must be that you two didn’t discuss it properly. You saved him once. All these years, he’s always remembered your kindness. I believe he’ll definitely agree to it!” ”

“”Chen Siyao!”Old Master Chen looked at Chen Siyao, unable to contain his anger. ”

He was really angry.

“”Grandpa,”Chen Siyao cried. “I know you’re blaming me for not living up to expectations, but what can I do? I can’t control my feelings. I just like him! “I want to be myself too, but he’s the only one left in my life!” ”

“Because there was only song Shiyu left in her life, Chen Siyao’s life had no other colors. ”

Old Master Chen looked at Chen Siyao and shook his head angrily.

“If song Shiyu and Chen Siyao were in love, wouldn’t Chen Siyao be a joke if she couldn’t live without song Shiyu? ”

“He had never truly loved anyone in his life. His marriage with old madam Chen was just a respectful marriage, so he couldn’t feel the same way. ”

He couldn’t even understand Chen Siyao.

“”Grandfather, I’m begging you. Can you help me again?” ”

“There’s no other way.”Old Master Chen sighed.

“Chen Siyao looked at Old Master Chen, and the light in her eyes suddenly dimmed. She continued, “Grandfather, if I can’t marry Song Shiyu, I won’t live anymore.” ”

“Her eyes were firm, and she didn’t look angry at all. ”

“”Then go to hell!”Old Master Chen was still angry, so he casually replied. ”

“Hearing this, Chen Siyao immediately stood up from the ground and walked out of the door. ”

“Eldest miss!”The housekeeper was shocked and immediately caught up with Chen Siyao’s footsteps.

Old Master Chen looked at Chen Siyao’s back and frowned.

Sigh!

“”Eldest miss, old master only said those words in a moment of anger. Please don’t take it to heart.”The housekeeper pulled Chen Siyao’s arm. “You are old master’s only granddaughter. If anything happens to you, what Will Old Master Do?” ”

“Chen Siyao’s face was full of tears. “He never cared about me, his granddaughter!” ”

“If Old Man Chen really cared about her, he wouldn’t have watched her struggle so painfully! ”

“”From the moment I was born, he regretted that I wasn’t a boy.”Chen Siyao’s mouth was full of sarcasm. “He must be even more regretful now. If I were a boy, I wouldn’t have made such a joke!” ”

Every word was extremely harsh!

“When Old Master Chen heard these words, he was so angry that he almost vomited blood. ”

He had always thought highly of Chen Siyao and had never felt that there was only a difference between a man and a woman.

“But now, Chen Siyao actually said these words, making old master Chen feel that there was still a difference between a man and a woman. ”

“Even the Butler couldn’t listen to her. “Eldest miss, you can’t say things like that! Old Master has doted on you since you were young and treated you as a pearl. You have always been his pride...” ”

Chen Siyao just smiled and didn’t say anything.

Her smile was full of sarcasm.

“The housekeeper continued, “The old man really cares about you. Please don’t let your imagination run wild.” ”

“Chen Siyao looked at the housekeeper and continued, “Alright, you don’t have to say anymore! I know this very well in my heart!” ”

“Eldest miss!”The housekeeper said somewhat helplessly.

“At that moment, old master Chen said, “Let Her Go!” ”

“The Butler glanced at Old Master Chen and sighed helplessly. Then, he let go of Chen Siyao’s arm. ”

Chen Siyao laughed coldly in her heart.

She knew it!

“The Butler jogged to Old Master Chen’s side and asked worriedly, “Old master, will anything happen to eldest miss?” ”

“”If she’s capable, she can force song Shiyu to really marry her!”Old Master Chen deliberately raised his voice. “What kind of ability is that? !” ”

His voice was very loud.

“Naturally, Chen Siyao could hear him clearly. She bit her lip, her eyes filled with unwillingness. ”

“It was fine if outsiders bullied her and looked down on her, but now even her own grandfather wanted to step on her! ”

What was this?

“The Butler was worried that Chen Siyao wouldn’t be able to take it, so he continued, “Old Man, eldest miss isn’t feeling too good right now. Please don’t push her too hard.” ”
