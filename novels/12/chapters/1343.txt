“Chapter 1344: 278: Zhou Xiang then got tough and angrily rebuked Xie wanqiu, severing ties! 2”

Even Cen Shaoqing could barely match up to Zheng Wanyin.

“Wu Youyu nodded. “Right, you’re staying in the hospital. Has Your Stepdaughter come to see you?””

“”I’m sick. How can she not come?”Xie wanqiu continued, “Not only did she come, she even shamelessly apologized to me! She wants me to forgive her!””

“What about our eldest grandson?”

“This eldest grandson was, of course, referring to Cen Shaoqing.”

“Xie Wanqiu was Cen Shaoqing’s grandmother, so he was naturally cen Shaoqing’s grandfather.”

“”That B * Tch Zhou Xiang hid the fact that I was hospitalized! But yinyin has already reminded her. If nothing goes wrong, Cen Shaoqing will definitely come to see me tomorrow.”She was Cen Shaoqing’s grandmother, she was sick, so Cen Shaoqing would definitely come to see her.”

“That’s good.”Wu youyu peeled an orange for Xie wanqiu. “I heard from you on wechat that our eldest grandson has a girlfriend. What’s going on?”

“In fact, Wu Youyu came for this matter.”

Cen Shaoqing had a girlfriend. This was not a small matter.

“If things changed, how would he become the old master of the Cen Family?”

“No matter how powerful Xie Wanqiu was, she was just a woman.”

This woman was not as powerful as a man when it came to handling matters.

“Therefore, at this time, he had to be by Xie Wanqiu’s side to come up with ideas.”

“Otherwise, Xie wanqiu would definitely not be able to handle it alone.”

“Speaking of this, Xie wanqiu said with disdain, “That little b * Tch won’t be able to achieve anything! She can’t even compare to one-thousandth of our yinyin!””

“After saying that, xie wanqiu continued, “Cen Shaoqing is very filial to this grandmother of his. He will definitely listen to my words.”” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Wu youyu smiled and said, “You are his grandmother. How can he not listen to your words? When our yinyin marries him, then the CEN family will be under our control.””

“Speaking of this, Xie wanqiu narrowed her eyes. “It’s not that simple. The Cen family still has a dead old woman. As long as that old woman doesn’t die, Yinyin won’t be able to take over the Cen family.””

“Isn’t that dead old woman almost ninety years old?”Wu Youyu asked.

“Xie wanqiu continued, “I found a fortune-teller to read her fortune. He said that the Dead Old Woman’s life is like wood. She can live forever and can live for a hundred years!””

“As long as she thought about how people like Bai Tang could live for a hundred years, Xie wanqiu felt an indescribable pain.”

On what basis could Bai Tang live for a hundred years?

“Wu Youyu did not take these words to heart, he smiled and said, “You believe the words of a fraud? Of course, he’s just saying what he wants to hear. That damn old woman is almost ninety years old. Who knows, she might go to Hell one day! The most important thing for us now is to let yinyin marry in as soon as possible.””

How many people in China could live for a hundred years?

“Hearing Wu Youyu’s words, Xie wanqiu felt a little better. “You’re right.””

On the other side.

Zheng Wanyin was queuing up to buy oil tea fruits.

“It was already past the time to eat, but there were still quite a number of people queuing up.”

“If they continued to queue like this, they wouldn’t be able to buy oil tea fruits for less than an hour.”

“Zheng Wanyin couldn’t be bothered to waste her time in such a place. She walked directly to a person who was queuing up to buy oil tea fruits, “Hello, there’s an old man at my house who really wants to eat the oil tea fruit, but the queue is too long. I still have other things to do. Can you sell your oil tea fruit to me?””

“”I’m sorry, I want to eat this myself.”The long-haired girl shook her head.”

Who would be willing to queue for another hour?

Zheng Wanyin took out her wallet. “Name your price.”

“The long-haired girl maintained her smile and said politely, “Beauty, this is not a matter of money.””

“Zheng Wanyin knew what she meant. This kind of poor person was the most disgusting. She clearly wanted to raise the price, but she had to pretend that she did not want to sell it to raise the price.”

A poor person was a poor person. Their thoughts would never reach that realm.

She did not know how to help others?

“An elderly man wanted to eat the oil tea fruit, but she did not even know to make way.”

Kong Rong had not learned how to make a Pear?

No wonder the news repeatedly reported the phenomenon of young people not giving up their seats to the elderly.

“For a girl like this, let alone giving up their seats, she could not even give up her oil tea fruit.”

A civilized society was corrupted by such a worm!

“After so many years of reading the book of sages, she had read it all into the stomach of a dog?”

“Zheng Wanyin took out two hundred-dollar bills, still maintaining a smile on her face. “This oil tea fruit is 20 yuan per serving. I have 200 yuan here.””
