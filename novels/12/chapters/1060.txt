“I’m fine.”Ye Zhuo shook his head.

“”It’s good that you’re fine. You worried me to death!”Thinking of Ye Zhuo’s experience, an Lizi was extremely scared. She continued, “By the way, where’s Pingting? Why don’t I see Pingting? Could it be that Pingting has already...” An Lizi’s voice was stuck in her throat. ”

“Actually, Zhao Pingting was standing right beside her. However, Zhao Pingting was covered in filth and her hair was disheveled. An Lizi did not recognize her at all. ”

“”Lizi,”Zhao Pingting said with a choked voice. ” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Hearing Zhao Pingting’s voice, an Lizi was stunned for a moment. She looked up and only then did she recognize Zhao Pingting. She hugged her and cried, “Pingting! How did you become like this! ? Pingting, are you alright?” ”

“Zhao Pingting hugged an lizi and cried, “I’m fine, I’m fine...” ”

“After the police collected the evidence in the basement, the girls were taken to the hospital by ambulance. ”

Ye Zhuo and an Lizi followed them to the police station to take their statements.

“The news of the serial killer being caught spread in an instant. Countless reporters surrounded the entrance of the hospital, hoping to interview the victims. ”

“When many internet celebrities heard the news, they immediately took their phones to the crime scene to clock in. ”

“Zhao Pingting was diagnosed with multiple soft tissue contusions all over her body. She had a mild concussion and the external injuries were all minor. The most serious injury was mental trauma. Thinking of the Inhuman experience of a day and a night, Zhao Pingting sat on the hospital bed, she hugged her knees with both hands, and her entire body was trembling. ”

“If time could be reversed, she would never have used the internet to book a car, much less drink the drink that the driver had given her. ”

“In fact, she was considered lucky. That short-haired girl had been locked up for more than two weeks, and during that period, she had even been violated. The amount of harm she had suffered was more than ten times more than what she had suffered! ”

“Knock, Knock, knock — ”

“Suddenly, there was a knock on the door. ”

“”Come in,”Zhao Pingting said after a while. ”

“A policewoman came in with a young woman in her thirties. When she saw Zhao Pingting sitting on the bed, the policewoman asked with concern, “Pingting, how are you? Are you better now?” ”

“Much better.”Zhao pingting nodded.

“The policewoman continued, “By the way, let me introduce you to Dr. Huang, the psychologist of the Second People’s Hospital. Pingting, you can tell her anything. She will help you.” ”

“The young woman immediately stood up and said with an amiable expression, “Hello, my name is Huang Li. You can call me sister Li.” ”

“”Sister Li.”Zhao ping ting continued, “Actually, I don’t need a psychologist. I’m fine.” ”

“Huang Li smiled and said, “Don’t be nervous. You can treat me as a big sister or your good friend. Oh right, I heard that you have a very powerful friend!” ”

“Speaking of friends, Zhao Pingting’s eyes finally lit up. “Yes, if it weren’t for my friend, I might still be locked in the basement.” ”

“The policewoman saw that Zhao Pingting and Huang Li were gradually getting into a good mood, so she quietly walked out of the ward, leaving time and space for them. ”

“She hoped that Huang Li could successfully enlighten Zhao Pingting, bring Zhao pingting out of the predicament, and forget what happened that day and night. ”

“An hour later, Huang Li came out of the ward. ”

“The policewoman waiting outside immediately went up to her and asked, “Doctor Huang, how is it?” ”

Huang Li shook her head. “The situation isn’t very optimistic.”

The policewoman frowned slightly.

“Huang Li sighed and continued, “But she’s still considered lucky. At least she wasn’t assaulted. The other few aren’t so lucky!” ”

“After saying that, Huang Li continued, “Oh right, where’s her family? They haven’t arrived yet? For her now, no matter what kind of psychological treatment, it can’t compare to the company of her family!” ”

“The policewoman continued, “They’re on their way here now! She’s not a local. Her hometown is Yun Jing. After her family heard about this, they immediately bought a plane ticket to come here.”It took four hours to fly from Yun Jing to the capital, it would take one and a half hours to get from the capital airport to the hospital without the traffic jam. ”

Huang Li nodded. “That’s good.”

“After ye Zhuo and an Lizi left the police station, they drove to the hospital where Zhao Pingting was currently staying. ”

“As soon as they arrived at the hospital, they saw a bunch of reporters crowding around the entrance. ”

Ye Zhuo frowned slightly.

The victim had already suffered a huge psychological trauma. How could she still have the courage to face the cameras?

“If they did that, they would only cause the girls a second injury! ”

Ye Zhuo took out his phone and sent a message.

“After sending the message, ye Zhuo turned around and walked to the other side. ”
