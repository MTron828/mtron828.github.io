“Zhao Dan patted Manxing’s hand, “Xing ‘er, you must remember that not everyone in this world is as kind as you, even if they are sisters from the same mother. Therefore, even if ye Zhuo comes back in the future, you can not treat her sincerely! She is different from Manwen. You can treat Manwen as your biological brother, but you definitely can not treat her as your biological sister!” ”

“At the very least, Manwen sincerely treated Manxing as his older sister and protected Manxing in every way. ”

Ye Zhuo was probably only jealous of Manxing because of his scheming.

“After all, Manxing’s life since Young was a hundred times better than Manxing’s. ”

“Hearing this, Manxing smiled and nodded. “Mom, I know everything.” ”

“Zhao dan continued, “You must remember my words in your heart. You Can’t be schemed against by that unfilial daughter.” ”

“Okay.”

“Just as Mr. Feng had expected, he contacted him again the next day and apologized to him and ye Zao. He said that he had tried his best, but his parents insisted on going to the interstellar court. She couldn’t do anything about it. ”

“After cutting off the connection with Manxing, Mr. Feng looked at Leo. “What did I say?” ”

“Leo was completely convinced. He gave Mr. Feng a thumbs up. “Mr. Feng, you’re the best.” ”

“”It’s useless to say you’re the best.”Mo Gilan walked over with a pink dress. “Leader Leo, the women’s dress has been prepared for you. See if it fits you.” ”

Leo was stunned. “F * ck! You’re serious!”

“Mo Gilan Glanced at Leo. “Who’s joking with you? A gentleman never goes back on his word. Do you want to wear this dress yourself, or do you want me to help you wear it?” ”

“At this moment, Leo only wanted to slap his stupid self to death. ”

Why did he want to make a bet with Mogilan?

“To go to the Central Street to join in the fun dressed like this, was he shameless? ”

“If he was willing to make a bet, he had to admit defeat. It would be inappropriate if he didn’t wear it now! ”

“With no other choice, Leo could only take the dress and go to the changing room to change. ”

“Walking out of the changing room again, the group of men outside laughed until they cried. ”

“Seeing them laugh like this, Leo swore in his heart that he would never make wagers with others again. ”

“In the blink of an eye, it was Friday. ”

This was because the main characters of the incident were ye Zhuo and the leaders of the Manxing Kingdom.

“In addition, this lawsuit had caused such a sensation on the starnet previously and had attracted the attention of netizens. Therefore, it was going to be broadcasted live the entire time. ”

The Manjiangshan couple came very early.

Man Xing also attended.

“Looking at the defendant’s seat, Ye Zhuo did not even show his face. ”

“Seeing that the court was getting closer and closer, the bullet screen was very interesting. ”

“[ ye Zhuo wouldn’t dare to come, right? ] ”

“[ it’s possible! After all, after the paternity test, she would have no excuses! ] ”

[ ye Zhuo really disappointed me! ]

“[ I see that Mr. and Mrs. Man’s eyes are so red. They must have cried. I really don’t know why ye Zhuo would do this! To have such parents, she should be happy! But Ye Zhuo doesn’t know how to cherish them! ] ”

“”If I were Mr. and Mrs. Manman, even if ye Zao kneels on the ground and begs me after the appraisal report comes out, I wouldn’t forgive her!” ”

“”One look and I know that Mr. and Mrs. Manman wouldn’t do such a thing. As parents, no matter how ye Zao treats them, they will unconditionally forgive ye Zao.” ”

“”Yes, yes, yes. After all, Mr. and Mrs. Manman are very kind people.” ”

“”Ten minutes! It Can’t be that ye Zao really won’t come, right?” ”

Time passed by minute by minute.

“Seeing that there were only five minutes left before the court session, man Jiangshan and Zhao Dan were also a little anxious. ”

Could it be that ye Zao really won’t come?

“If ye Zao didn’t come, how would they continue this scene? ” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“At this moment, the sound of footsteps came from the entrance. ”

Zhao Dan looked up and saw a group of people walking over. One of them was a slender figure that stood out from the crowd.

She wore black clothes and black pants. Her hair was tied up meticulously. Her black sunglasses almost covered her entire face. Only her crimson lips and thin chin were exposed.

She looked cold and capable. A powerful aura erupted from her.

“Seeing who it was, man Xing immediately stood up from his seat and greeted her gently, “Elder sister.” ”

“His voice was not loud, but it was heard by ye Zao. ”

“Ye Zao slowly took off his sunglasses and turned to look at man Xing. He said slowly, “Miss Man Xing, don’t mess around with relatives. I only have one elder brother and one younger brother.” ”

Man Xing still maintained his polite smile.

“The onlookers were trying to defend man Xing. [ why is she like this? Miss Man Xing greeted her with good intentions, but she has such an attitude! I really feel bad for Mr. and Mrs. Man! ] ”

[ miss man Xing is so wronged! ]

“Ye Zao walked to the dock and sat down. Behind him sat Cen Shaoqing, Lin Jincheng, Ye Shu, Lin Ze, Ye Hanlei, and Mr. Ou Feng. ”

“After the judge said some official words, they began the paternity test. ”

The paternity test in the S galaxy was very advanced.

“As long as both parties pressed their palms on the device, the paternity test could be quickly determined. ”

Ye Zhuo walked forward and pressed his palm on it.

Pa..

The device lit up.

“Zhao Dan walked forward, with a hoarse voice, he said, “Yue’er, even without the device, I can still identify that you are my daughter! In this world, no mother would mistake her own child! I know that you have always hated me, but who are you?” ”

“Ye Zhuo looked up slightly. “Madam Man, whether it is true or not, you are right. It doesn’t matter if I say it.” ”

Zhao Dan sighed and imprinted his palm on the device helplessly.

“At this moment, everyone’s hearts were in their throats. ”

Beep Beep.

“At this moment, the sound of the device could be heard in the air. ”

“A mechanical voice could be heard from the device. “After verification, the relationship between Ye Zhuo and Zhao Dan is not valid.” ”
