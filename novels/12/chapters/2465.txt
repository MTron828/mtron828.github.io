“If it wasn’t for him back then, song Shiyu wouldn’t be the song Shiyu he was now. ”

“If song Shiyu really didn’t agree to his request, he could only force song Shiyu. ”

“Song Shiyu had always respected him. As long as he insisted on song Shiyu marrying Chen Siyao, song Shiyu would definitely not refuse. ”

“No matter what, he wanted to see song Shiyu marrying Chen Siyao before he closed his eyes. ”

“The driver was stunned for a moment before he turned around and said, “Are we going to Mr. Song’s Place?” ”

“”Yes,”Old Master Chen said. ”

The driver nodded. “Okay.”

“The car wasn’t going very fast. About twenty minutes later, the car stopped in front of Baiyun Residence. ”

Old Master Chen was pushed out of the car by the butler.

The butler of Baiyun Residence was still as respectful as ever as he invited Old Master Chen into the house.

Old Master Chen looked at the butler with a satisfied look in his eyes.

He knew that song Shiyu would not dare to be rude to him.

“After all, he was the person who made song Shiyu. ”

“Where is Shiyu?”Old Master Chen asked.

“Butler song said, “Old Master Chen, our boss doesn’t have the time to see you.” ”

“Hearing that, old master Chen frowned slightly. “You didn’t even inform him and you already know that he doesn’t want to see me? Is it that he doesn’t want to see me, or do you not want him to see me?” ”

“Butler song smiled and said, “Old Master Chen, you’ve misunderstood. I don’t have that much authority. It was our boss who told me that if you were to come, he would tell you directly that he doesn’t have the time to see you.” ”

The meaning of this sentence was very obvious.

“It wasn’t that he didn’t have the time to see him, but that he didn’t want to see him. ”

Song Shiyu couldn’t even be bothered to deal with old master Chen.

“Old Master Chen wasn’t angry either. He sat on the sofa and continued, “Is that what he told you?” ”

“Yes.”Butler song nodded.

“Old Master Chen nodded. “Alright, he won’t come to see me, right? Then I’ll go see him!” ”

“Upon hearing that, Butler song’s face was full of embarrassment. “Old Master, please don’t make things difficult for me.” ”

“Go to the third floor.”Old Master Chen looked at the butler.

The butler nodded. “Alright.”

“Butler song could not stop Old Man Chen, so he had no choice but to send someone to inform song Shiyu. ”

“Song Shiyu was processing documents. When he heard this, he frowned slightly. ”

It was really endless!

“After a while, song Shiyu continued, “Let them in.” ”

“Yes.”The assistant nodded and immediately sent a message to inform Butler song.

“When Butler song received the message, he did not make things difficult for old man Chen anymore. ”

Old Master Chen looked at Butler song. “Why aren’t you stopping him? Has Your boss given the Order?”

He knew that song Shiyu did not dare to act rashly in front of him!

“Butler song did not answer old master Chen directly. Instead, he made a ‘please’gesture and said, “Please.” ”

Old Master Chen snorted coldly.

“Not long after, they arrived at song Shiyu’s office on the third floor. ”

“”Shiyu, I’m here again,”Old Master Chen continued. “I heard that you’re quite busy right now. I shouldn’t have come to disturb you, but if we don’t resolve this matter properly, I won’t be at ease either.” ”

“Song Shiyu put down the document and continued, “Old Master Chen, are you here for Miss Chen’s matter again?” ”

“It was only then that old master Chen noticed the way song Shiyu addressed him. He frowned slightly. “Shiyu, when did you become so estranged from Yaoyao?” ”

Miss Chen?

“Although song Shiyu and Chen Siyao weren’t close, they didn’t go so far as to call each other by their first names. ”

“”It wasn’t a particularly close relationship to begin with,”song Shiyu continued. “Old Master Chen, I’ve already made things very clear last time. It’s important to know your limits.” ”

Song Shiyu wasn’t a talkative person.

Some things were best left unsaid.

But Old Master Chen didn’t seem to know what was meant by ‘left unsaid’.

Song Shiyu did not expect that old master Chen would come for a second visit.

This was really meaningless.

One should know one’s place.

“”What a good person.”Old Master Chen laughed out loud. He looked up at song Shiyu and continued, “Shiyu, you have really forgotten about the past!” ” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“At this point, the smile on Old Master Chen’s face disappeared. He sighed and continued, “At that time, everyone advised me not to get involved in your family’s matters. However, I did not think that way. I felt that people should do something good...” ”

How Old was song Shiyu back then?

But he had forgotten what had happened back then so quickly.

It was really impossible to be a good person in this world.

Song Shiyu listened to Old Master Chen’s words without any expression on his face.

“Old Master Chen raised his head and looked at song Shiyu, then, he said, “Shiyu, as long as you still have a little conscience, you should marry Yaoyao. The person I can’t put my heart at ease right now is Yaoyao. Can you treat it as you helping me one last time?” ”
