Translator: 549690339

“”Not yet,”Xia Xiaoman said with a smile, “Ah Shu called to say that Scorch didn’t get home until four o’clock this morning, so she came late. Second sister-in-law and third sister-in-law are already on their way.” ”

Wu Mei nodded.

“Xia Xiaoman turned to look at the maid. “Go and call Lizi over! This child, her uncle and aunt are already here, but she doesn’t know how to come out and call for Help!” ”

“”Yes, Madam.”The maid turned around and went to an Lizi’s room to call for help. ”

“As soon as the maid reached the corner, she saw an Lizi coming out of the back room. “Miss, you’re here. It just so happens that Madam asked me to call for you.” ”

“From Afar, an Lizi heard Wu Mei and Xia Xiaoman’s voices. “Are my uncle and aunt here?” ”

“Yes.”The maid nodded.

“”Okay, I understand.”An Lizi walked quickly to the living room. ”

“When she reached the living room, an lizi greeted politely, “Uncle, aunt.” ”

“Lin Qingyang was talking to Lin Qingxuan. When he heard her, he smiled and nodded at an Lizi. ”

“Wu Mei smiled and said, “I haven’t seen Lizi for a long time. The little girl is getting more and more beautiful!” ”

“An Lizi said, “Aunt, you are getting younger and younger.” ”

“As a woman, who wouldn’t like to be praised for being young. ”

The smile on Wu Mei’s face grew wider.

“”Aiyo, it’s too cold in the capital!”Zhang Zhenzhen’s voice sounded from outside. ”

“Hearing the voice, Xia Xiaoman immediately walked out of the door. “Second sister-in-law is here! Come in and Warm Up!” ”

“”Second aunt, have a sip of the hot milk tea first.”An Lizi promptly handed over a cup of milk tea. ”

Zhang Zhenzhen took the cup of milk tea and took a big sip. Only then did she feel alive.

“Zhang Zhenzhen and Lin Qingyun had moved to the south in the early years. The temperature in the south was around 27 degrees all year round. When they suddenly came to the capital, which was more than minus ten degrees Celsius, although they had put on a thick down jacket in advance.., it still chilled Zhang Zhenzhen quite a bit. ”

“This milk tea is not bad. What brand is it?”Zhang Zhenzhen took another sip and looked up at an Lizi.

“An Lizi said, “It’s made by the family’s dessert master. If you like it, I’ll pour you another Cup.” ”

“Sure.”Zhang Zhenzhen nodded.

An Lizi took the empty cup from Zhang Zhenzhen and poured the milk tea.

“Xia Xiaoman continued, “Second sister-in-law, why don’t I see Second Brother?” ”

“Zhang Zhenzhen said, “Your second brother is fighting with someone outside! He should be here soon!”Lin Qingyun’s biggest hobby was fighting with chickens. For this, he even invested a lot of money. ”

Xia Xiaoman nodded.

Zhang Zhenzhen looked into the room. “Big Brother and sister-in-law have arrived.”

“Second brother and sister-in-law have arrived too.”

“”Sister-in-law, are you cold?”Zhang Zhenzhen asked. ”

“Wu Mei continued, “It’s okay. It’s not very cold. The temperature in the capital city and the West continent are about the same. But you, you just got off the plane. You must not be used to it, right?” ”

“”Exactly. I’m freezing to death on the way here!”Zhang Zhenzhen continued, “If you ask me, we should all go to the south city during the New Year!”! South city is so nice. It’s neither cold nor hot. The capital city is really freezing! I really don’t know how you guys can stand it.” ”

“Wu Mei smiled and said, “Everyone has their own good points.” ”

“Not long after, the third brother, Lin Qingyang, and Yang Wenyin arrived as well. ”

“In the blink of an eye, only Lin Jincheng’s family of four had not arrived yet. ”

“The four sisters-in-law were playing mahjong together. Yang Wenyin smiled and said, “Ah Shu still lives in the capital city! Why did she come so late?” ”

“Xia Xiaoman explained, “Burning was in C Nation before. He only got home at four in the morning. Ah Shu called and said that he would be late.” ” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Yang Wenyin nodded. “Right, do you know that little twelve is building an aircraft carrier?” ”

“I know that.”Zhang Zhenzhen nodded. “Isn’t it already under construction? I read that burning has signed a betting agreement with several other countries. They said that they will complete the aircraft carrier project within two years.”

“”A betting agreement?”Yang Wenyin said in surprise, “Little Twelve has signed a betting agreement with someone?” ”

“That’s right!”Zhang Zhenzhen took out a second piece of paper. “I read that in the report.”

“Hearing that, Xia Xiaoman’s eyes flashed with worry. “This betting agreement isn’t a joke. Why haven’t I heard about it from burning?” ”

“After signing the bet agreement, if there were any problems with the aircraft carrier project, then ye Zao would be finished! ”

“At that time, the entire Lin family wouldn’t have enough money to pay for it. ”

“Wu Mei smiled and said, “I think little twelve is a child who knows her limits. Since she signed the bet agreement, she definitely has the confidence to complete the aircraft carrier project. You guys, just put your hearts at ease! “Our Lin family has been doing business for so many years, but who would have thought that in the end, there would be a scientific researcher!” ”
