“”Mom, are you sure that uncle Wang will marry you and not just for fun?”Li Hang was still a little worried. ”

“”What did you say, Kid! What do you mean by just for fun!”Zhou Cuihua was a little angry, “If it’s really just for fun, will your uncle Wang Be So Serious? If he’s just for fun, will he bring me to his house?” ”

Li hang did not say anything.

“In fact, what Zhou Cuihua said made a lot of sense. Looking at boss Wang’s appearance, it was indeed not just for fun. ”

But Li Hang was a person who thought far ahead. She was a little worried.

“After all, no one could guess what would happen tomorrow. What if boss Wang did not like Zhou Cuihua one day? ”

“Although Li Dalong did not have much money, it was better than the poor Zhou Cuihua. ”

“Therefore, the current Li hang did not dare to change easily. ”

“Seeing that Li Hang was still hesitant, Zhou Cui Hua was a little angry. She continued, “Whatever you want, Hang Hang!”As a mother, she had already done what she should do. The rest of the decision was up to Li Hang himself. ”

“Li hang smiled and said, “Mom, are you still angry?” ”

“”I’m not angry. I just feel that you, this child, don’t know what’s good for you!”Zhou cuihua continued, “Your uncle Wang is so good to you. He prepared this and that for you, yet you still have such an attitude!”It was like a dog biting Lu Dongbin! ”

“As the mother and daughter were talking, the sound of the door being pushed opened came from outside. ”

Zhou cuihua turned back and saw boss Wang walking in with milk tea.

“Seeing this, Zhou cuihua immediately changed the topic and said, “Hang Hang, what do you want to eat later?” ”

“Although Li Hang didn’t look back, he knew why Zhou Cuihua suddenly changed the topic. He smiled and said, “I can eat anything. Mom, please order more of Uncle Wang’s favorite food.” ”

Zhou cuihua nodded.

“At this moment, boss Wang walked to the two of them. “Lai Hang, drink the milk tea.” ”

“Li Hang was flattered. He immediately stood up and took the milk tea from boss Wang with both hands. “Thank you, Uncle Wang.” ”

“”We’re a family. There’s no need to say thank you.”Boss Wang continued, “You Child, you’re always so polite.” ”

“Zhou cuihua said from the side, “This child has been polite since he was young.” ”

“Boss Wang said, “Thank you for teaching him well.” ”

Zhou cuihua smiled a little embarrassedly.

“Soon after, Zhou Cuihua asked the waiter to bring the menu and ordered some of boss Wang’s favorite dishes. ”

“Although boss Wang liked her very much, young people nowadays were all fastidious about two-way love. ”

“Boss Wang liked her so much and had given so much for her, so she should also express her feelings. ”

“After eating, boss Wang entered the main topic, looking at Li hang, he said, “Hang Hang, your mother has already told me about your situation. Uncle won’t force you. If you’re willing to follow us, then follow us. If you can’t bear to part with your father, then continue to follow your father.” ” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Speaking up to this point, boss Wang paused, “As for me, I only have one son. He’s 28 years old this year and currently lives in Australia. If you live with us, your mother and I don’t plan to have another child. Firstly, your mother is old. If she gives birth again, it will definitely be bad for her health. “But if you don’t come, your mother and I have already discussed it. After we get married, we will start preparing for a pregnancy. A family must have an heir and hope.” ”

These words had already been said to the end.

Li Hang was a little excited.

“There were some words that he heard from Zhou Cuihua, and hearing boss Wang say it with his own ears was another matter. ”

“The meaning in boss Wang’s words was already very obvious. As long as she was willing to nod her head, she would be the successor of the Wang Group in the future. ”

“Basically, no one could reject such a heaven-splashing wealth, and naturally, Li Hang couldn’t either. ”

“Li hang pondered over the words in his heart and continued, “Uncle Wang, I know what you and my mother mean. First of all, thank you for your great love. Yes, but I still have to consider this matter carefully. Can you give me three days?” ”

“She couldn’t agree to it immediately, as it would seem a little impatient. ”

“Boss Wang nodded and said with a smile, “Sure, Hang Hang, think about it carefully. Actually, I can understand your current mood. The heart and the back of the hand are all flesh. One side is the father, and the other is the mother. It’s indeed a little difficult to choose.” ”

“”Thank you for your understanding, uncle Wang.” ”

“Boss Wang said, “As I said, we’re all family. There’s no need to be so polite. Hang Hang, even if you choose your biological father, you’re welcome to visit our house frequently.” ”

Visit.

He said visit.

“This was also to remind Li hang that if Li Hang did not choose to follow Zhou cuihua, then she would be a guest to him and the Wang family. ”
