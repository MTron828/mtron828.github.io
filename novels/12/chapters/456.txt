Translator: 549690339

“Song Chenyu stood beside Cen Yuyan. Her expression was normal, but her fingers were clenched tightly. ”

Could it be...

Ye Zhuo was the legendary Miracle Doctor Ye?

“Song Chenyu was a big sister in the entertainment industry. She had won the Phoenix Goddess Gold award three years in a row. She had never been a proud person, but she believed that she was not an ordinary person. ”

“She was in high school at the age of 13. She entered university at the age of 15. At the age of 22, she received a double master’s degree. ”

“She was only 27 now, but she already had achievements that ordinary girls would never dare to dream of. No one had ever given her a sense of crisis. ”

But Ye Zhuo.

“Somehow, he gave her a sense of crisis. ”

“Gu dening looked up at Cen Yuyan and said very seriously, “Fourth Miss Cen, I’m not joking with you. Not only is Miss ye my mentor, she is also the number one person who has conquered cancer, Miracle Doctor Ye! She has shown me kindness!” ”

Cen Yuyan’s expression froze.

Doctor Ye?

Ye Zhuo was actually Doctor Ye!

How was this possible?

“”Doctor Ye!”Cen Yueya couldn’t help but scream, “Doctor Gu, you’re not joking, right? Is Zhuozhuo really the legendary Doctor Ye? The number one doctor ye who has conquered cancer? !” ”

“”Yes, I’m not joking,”gu dening said. ”

Cen Yueya was dumbfounded.

She didn’t expect that the Miracle Doctor ye that she had always admired was actually ye Zhuozhuo.

The famous Miracle Doctor Ye in Huaxia was actually her younger sister-in-law!

What kind of fate was this?

Cen Yueya was really too excited!

She wished she could hug ye Zhuozhuo and kiss him hard.

Not to mention Cen Yueya.

Even Cen Shaoqing was stunned for a moment and turned to look at Ye Zhuozhuo. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

He knew that ye Zao was a piece of unpolished jade.

But this result still shocked him.

Conquering cancer.

This was something that would benefit all mankind.

“It was rumored a while ago, but unfortunately, no one had ever seen Miracle Doctor Ye. ”

Who would have thought that Miracle Doctor Ye was far away in the horizon and right in front of their eyes.

“Ye Zao still had an indifferent look on his face. He did not reveal anything, as if the main character of the incident was not her. ”

The CEN family members were all more shocked.

No one had expected that ye Zao was Miracle Doctor Ye!

“Old Mrs. Cen turned to look at Ye Zao. “Ye, you’re such a child. You’ve achieved so much, and you didn’t even tell us!” ”

Ye Zao was a little embarrassed.

“If Gu dening had not suddenly come to the Cen family today, she would have forgotten about this matter. ”

“After all, cancer was just a small problem in her world. It was no different from a common cold and fever. ”

“Therefore, ye Zao never thought that curing cancer was a major achievement, and he never wanted to show off anything. ”

“Gu dening smiled and said, “Miss Ye is very low-key. The medical world arranged several international news interviews and a global award ceremony for her, but she refused all of them!” ”

This was also what Gu Dening admired most about ye Zao.

“If it were anyone else, would they be able to be as calm as ye Zao? ”

It was easy to say that they were indifferent to fame and fortune.

But how many people could do it?

“Old Mrs. Cen held ye Zao’s hand and laughed so hard that her eyes could not be seen. “Yes, yes, yes! Our Ye Zao is the most low-key! She’s not like some people who don’t make a sound when they’re full!” ”

“When she said the last sentence, old Mrs. Cen deliberately glanced at song Chenyu. ”

What was so great about knowing gu dening?

Her granddaughter-in-law was also the first person to conquer cancer!

“Song Chenyu heard the hidden meaning in old Mrs. Cen’s words and smiled. He walked to ye Zao’s side and politely extended his right hand, “I’m a loyal fan of Miracle Doctor Ye. I originally wanted Dening to introduce Miracle Doctor Ye to me. I didn’t expect to see Miracle Doctor Ye in person today. Nice to meet you. I’m Song Chenyu.” ”

“Ye Zao.”Ye Zao reached out and held song Chenyu’s hand. He spoke concisely.

Song Chenyu’s expression did not change.

He felt that ye Zao was not simple.

“She was a well-known female star in the entertainment industry. In recent years, she had monopolized almost all the resources in the industry. She was so popular that she became purple. Even Zhou Xiang, who met her for the first time, was especially excited and asked for her autograph. ”

“However, Ye Zao was indifferent. ”

“It was as if in Ye Zao’s eyes, she was no different from a passerby. ”

“However, she was only nineteen years old. ”

A nineteen-year-old girl was in the craze of chasing after celebrities. Could she really be so indifferent?

Song Chenyu lowered her eyes.

“Cen Yueya pulled ye Zao to sit down on the sofa. “Zao Zao, you’re really amazing! You have no idea how much I admire Miracle Doctor Ye!” ”

“If ye Zao had not kept a low profile, she would have even posted it on her wechat moments to show off. ”
