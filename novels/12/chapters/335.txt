“Ye Sen pretended to be mysterious and said, “Sister, Guess.” ”

“Did you sign a big ticket?”Ye Shu looked at Ye Sen.

“No.”Ye Sen shook his head.

Ye Shu looked at him. “Did you win the lottery?”

“The two of them walked and talked. After a while, they reached the door of their house. Ye Sen reached out and knocked on the door. “No, I stopped buying lottery tickets a long time ago! Sister, Guess again.” ”

“Ye Sen used to have dreams of getting rich overnight, so he often bought lottery tickets. ”

“Ever since he took over Sheng Dong Express, he had been focused on the company and never bought lottery tickets again. ”

None of these were true? !

Could it be...

Ye Shu narrowed her eyes. “Are you in a relationship?”

“Sister!”Ye Sen was amused. “You are so smart! You are indeed my biological sister!”

“Just then, little white opened the door from the inside. ”

Ye Sen let little white take the slippers.

After changing the slippers. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Ye Shu looked at Ye Sen and said in disbelief, “Really? You really found a girlfriend?” ”

“After the incident with Li Yiyi, Ye Shu thought that ye Sen would need a long time to recover from that relationship. ”

She didn’t expect it to be so fast.

“”Yes, I really did!”Ye Sen nodded. ”

“Ye Shu immediately asked, “Where is the girl from? How Old is she? What does she do?” ”

“As her elder sister, Ye Shu was most worried about Ye Sen’s life. ”

“When she heard the news, she was quite happy. ”

Ye Sen put the fried chicken on the table. “She is a local of Yunjing. She is 28 years old this year and is a dance teacher.”

“”Nice to meet you, teacher! Teacher teaches and educates people. She’s reasonable and is the gardener of our country!”Ye Shu continued, “By the way, how long have you two been in a relationship? Have you met her family?” ”

“Ye Sen continued, “We’ve known each other for almost three months and only confirmed our relationship today. She’s a very simple girl.” ”

“At this moment, ye Zao walked out of the house with a popsicle in his mouth. ”

“”Mom, uncle, what are you guys talking about?” ”

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “Zao Zao, your uncle found you an aunt.” ”

“Aunt?”Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly. “Really?”

Ye Sen pulled out a large drumstick and handed it to Ye Zao. “Of course it’s true! How can such a thing be fake?”

“”Uncle, how long have you known each other?” ”

“Ye Sen smiled and said, “Why do you two like to ask the same question? I’ve known her for almost three months.” ”

“Ye Zao frowned slightly. “You’ve only known her for less than three months and you’ve already confirmed your relationship? Uncle, you’ve already suffered a loss once. This time, you must keep your eyes wide open.” ”

The incident with Li Yiyi made ye Sen sad for a long time.

It had only been three months. How could he know the other party’s background?

What if he was deceived again?

“Ye Sen said, “Eldest niece, don’t worry. I definitely didn’t misjudge the person this time!” ”

“”Uncle, the word ‘bad person’won’t be carved on the face of a bad person.”Ye Zao took a bite of the drumstick and casually put the popsicle on the table. ”

“Ye Shu continued, “Zao Zao is right. Some people hide their thoughts very deeply. Oh right, how did you two meet?” ”

“Ye Sen talked about how he met Bai Wei, he patted his chest and said, “Sister, Zao Zao, don’t worry! “Although Bai Wei and I have only known each other for a few months, Bai Wei is really not the kind of person you think she is! “You will know when you see her! “I believe that when you see her, you will immediately fall in love with her! “Bai Wei is the kind of person who makes people feel very comfortable at a glance.” ”

Ye Sen believed that Bai Wei was not the kind of evil woman who was blinded by greed.

“If Bai Wei was really that kind of person, she would not have gone to the carpet tonight to pick out a necklace that was worth dozens of dollars. ”

She could have gone to the mall to pick out an expensive necklace.

But she did not.

“Although ye Sen had made a solemn vow, Ye Zhuo still did not have a good impression of Bai Wei, whom he had never met before, “It’s said that looks are born from the heart, but that’s not the case. Some people may look bitter and mean, but they are actually kind-hearted and very easy to get along with. On the contrary, some people may look very kind-hearted, but they are not necessarily kind-hearted!” ”

“Ye Zao had lived for two lifetimes, so what kind of people had he not seen before? ”

She always felt that ye Sen and Bai Wei’s meeting was too coincidental...

“After all, there was another word called hypocrisy. ”

“”I think what Zao Zao said is very right!”Ye Shu nodded, “Ye Sen, you’ve only known each other for three months, so you don’t know each other very well. There are some things that you should pay more attention to. Observe her personality and see if it’s as you imagine.” ”
