Chapter 64: Punishing the Bully and Protecting the Weak

All teachers loved students with good grades.

At this moment, the mathematics teacher looked at Ye Zhuo like a person who had been in the desert for a long time and suddenly saw a source of water.

“Student Ye Zhuo, you can go down now. In the future, you can sleep whenever you want in my class.”

“Thank you, teacher.”

Watching Ye Zhuo walk down the stage, the mathematics teacher continued, “If any of you can be as amazing as Student Ye Zhuo and solve Olympiad math problems while sleeping, you can do whatever you want in my class in the future! I don’t care even if the heavens punish me for it! But if you can’t, pay proper attention in my class! I believe that one day, all of you will be as amazing as Student Ye Zhuo!”

The students below the stage were as quiet as mice.

They were very curious as to why Ye Zhuo had suddenly become so clever?

After school at noon, Ye Zhuo invited Zhao Pingting to have lunch with her in the cafeteria. “Coincidentally, I have a good friend whom I want to introduce to you to.”

Zhao Pingting hesitated for a moment before nodding.

She was a little nervous. She was so fat, would Ye Zhuo’s good friend accept her?

However, it was obvious that Zhao Pingting’s worries were unnecessary.

An Lizi did not look down on Zhao Pingting at all. The three girls chatted and laughed as they walked toward the cafeteria.

There were many people in the cafeteria, and there was a long queue to order food.

Just as it was about to be their turn, two girls walked toward them. The one in the lead was a girl with long hair. She was wearing exquisite makeup and her school skirt was pulled up, so that it seemed much shorter than it should be.

“D*mn Fatty, get lost!”

When she saw who it was, Zhao Pingting subconsciously shivered and was about to walk away. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Ye Zhuo looked up slightly and took a step forward to shield Zhao Pingting. “What are you doing?”

“What does it have to do with you that I’m talking to this damn fatty! If you know what’s good for you, then get lost! Don’t stand in my way!”

“Zhuo Zhuo, forget it. I’ll just let them be.” Zhao Pingting tugged at the corner of Ye Zhuo’s clothes. It was obvious that she was used to being bullied.

“Don’t be afraid! With me around, they won’t dare to bully you!”

Hearing this, the long-haired girl’s eyes were filled with ridicule. It was obvious that she did not think much of Ye Zhuo.

“I’ll give you a chance. Get out of my way now! Otherwise, don’t blame me for being impolite!” The long-haired girl stretched her muscles.

“In that case, I want to see how impolite you are.”

Ye Zhuo lowered his eyes slightly and looked down at the long-haired girl.

The long-haired girl’s expression changed. She raised her hand to slap Ye Zhuo’s face.

However, in the next second, someone grabbed her hair.

Ye Zhuo pulled on the bully’s long hair with one hand and lifted her chin with the other. Her eyes were shining as she said, “Apologize to my deskmate.”

The sunlight shone through the glass window on her fair and delicate face.

She looked a little evil.

She also had an indescribable coolness to her!

With such a commotion, a bunch of onlookers instantly gathered around them.

“Holy shit! Who is that?! She’s so handsome!”

“I know her. She’s Ye Zhuo from Grade 12 Class 7!”

“Holy shit! I’ve heard of her before. Didn’t they say that she’s ugly?”

“She’s so pretty!”

“I’m in love!”

“…”

The long-haired girl was scared out of her wits. Although Ye Zhuo was smiling, there wasn’t a hint friendliness in her eyes. The bully felt a tearing pain on her scalp.

If she had known that Ye Zhuo was so strong and powerful, she definitely would not have provoked Zhao Pingting!

When did this damn fatty find such a backer?

“Apologize!” Ye Zhuo shouted again.

The long-haired girl gasped in pain and stammered, “I’m… I’m sorry.”

“Who are you apologizing to? Speak louder, I can’t hear you!”

The long-haired girl endured the pain and raised her voice, “Zhao Pingting, I’m sorry. I won’t dare to do it again. Please forgive me.”

“Pingting,” Ye Zhuo turned to look at Zhao Pingting, “Do you forgive her?”

Zhao Pingting was scared silly and nodded blankly.

So, her deskmate was this powerful?

Ye Zhuo then slowly let go of the girl’s long hair. “If you bully my deskmate again, I’ll make you bald. Do you believe me?”

The girl was so scared that her face turned pale. As soon as Ye Zhuo let go, she ran away.

“Wow! Zhuo Zhuo, you’re so handsome!” An Lizi looked at Ye Zhuo with stars in her eyes.

After sitting next to Ye Zhuo for so long, this was the first time An Lizi knew that Ye Zhuo was so strong and powerful!

Ye Zhuo said humbly, “I’m just average, third in the world.”

After saying that, Ye Zhuo looked at Zhao Pingting. “Pingting, if anyone dares to bully you again in the future, just tell me. I’ll help you beat her up!”

Zhao Pingting nodded. “Okay.”

Ye Zhuo put his arm around Zhao Pingting’s shoulder and said seriously, “But you have to learn to protect yourself. I don’t attack others if they don’t attack me. If they do, I’ll kill them no matter how far away they are!”

Zhao Pingting looked at Ye Zhuo and was a little stunned.

Many years later, she still remembered this scene. It was Ye Zhuo who let her see the light and brightness in her life. She filled her life with hope.

…

Beijing.

Today was Lin Ze’s birthday.

Feng Qianhua and her daughter, Feng Xianxian, came to the Lin family’s house to celebrate Lin Ze’s birthday.

The 18-year-old boy had already grown up. His facial features were handsome and his bearing was extraordinary.

He was exactly the same as Lin Jincheng when he was young.

“Brother Ah Ze, Happy birthday. This is my birthday present to you.” Feng Xianxian handed over the exquisite gift box.

Lin Ze’s voice was neither cold nor indifferent. “Thank you, but there’s no need.”

It was unknown who Lin Ze had taken after in terms of his personality. The youth was mature and very boring. He did not like to talk normally.

He was the silent type of person who talked very little.

Logically speaking, he and Feng Xianxian had grown up together and they should be very close. However, he did not like Feng Xianxian at all.

This was because Feng Xianxian liked to cry since she was young and she would often get snot and saliva all over her face. On the other hand, Lin Ze had a serious mysophobia and liked to be clean since he was young.

Moreover, Feng Xianxian had a bad temper. She took advantage of Madam Lin’s liking for her and went around bullying people as she liked.

Because of Feng Xianxian, Lin Ze did not have a good impression of girls.

Madam Lin glared at Lin Ze. “Ah Ze, how can you be so rude! This is a gift from your sister! Quickly apologize to your sister!”

Lin Ze pursed his lips and did not say anything.

Feng Qianhua smiled and tried to smooth things over. “It’s okay, it’s okay. Aunt Lin, the child is young. Don’t take it to heart.”

Feng Xianxian had inherited Feng Qianhua’s teachings, she hugged Madam Lin’s arm and said, “Grandma, it’s fine. I know that Brother Ah Ze is cold on the outside but warm on the inside. In fact, he has good intentions! I don’t blame him at all! By the way, this cake was personally made by my mother. Remember to eat more later.”

Lin Ze was Madam Lin’s youngest grandchild. In addition, he was brought up by Old Madam Lin, so she usually treasured Lin Ze very much.

How could she bear to scold him?

Feng Xianxian’s words hit the nail on the head.

“Our Xianxian is still the most sensible, unlike that rascal!”

Feng Qianhua put the candles on the cake and lit them. “Ah Ze, come blow out the candles.”

The maids in the living room turned off the lights.

Feng Qianhua and Feng Xianxian sang a birthday song together.

The atmosphere looked very warm.

However, Lin Ze did not have a smile on his face. He blew out the candles expressionlessly and cut a piece of cake for Madam Lin. “Grandma, I have an appointment with my classmate to go out and play. It’s time, I’ll be leaving first.”

This was why Madam Lin liked Lin Ze so much.

Although this child’s personality was a little boring, he would always respect her as his grandmother no matter what.

Madam Lin waved her hand and said with a smile, “Go ahead. When you come back, remember to call ahead and ask the driver to pick you up.”

“Okay.”

Feng Qianhua nudged Feng Xianxian.

Feng Xianxian stood up and said, “Brother Ah Ze, can you bring me along?”

Lin Ze turned to look at her. “It’s not convenient.”

Feng Xianxian’s eyes instantly turned red. She was so aggrieved that she was about to cry.

She was very beautiful, and everywhere she went, people would chase after her and try their best to please her. Only Lin Ze dared to treat her like this.

Feng Qianhua smiled and patted Feng Qianqian on the shoulder. “Ah Ze’s good friends are all boys. If a little girl like you tagged along with them, how would that look like? Alright! Stop being so pretentious! Don’t act like you’ve been wronged!”
