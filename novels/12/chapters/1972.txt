Translator: 549690339

It was not until 10:30 in the morning that the he family’s parents received a call from their assistant.

“When they received the call, mother he was so emotional that tears welled up in her eyes. “Thank you, assistant Xiao Shen. Thank you!” ”

“”You’re welcome. If you want to thank someone, go thank Miss Ye. All of this is thanks to Miss Ye. It has nothing to do with me.” ”

“That’s right. I want to thank Miss Ye. Thank Miss Ye!”

“Father he was beside them. After mother he hung up, father he asked impatiently, “Is Ziteng Alright?” ”

“”Yes, yes...”mother he nodded. She was so excited that she could not speak. ”

“Father he continued, “Then quickly go up and tell Yaoyao about this.” ”

“Pregnant women were all lethargic. Now that Xu Yao was still sleeping, it was definitely not suitable for him to go up. ”

Mother he nodded and immediately ran upstairs.

“When she went up, Xu Yao was just about to open the door and go down. After all, today was he ziteng’s Big Day. As an infatuated girlfriend, Xu Yao naturally could not sleep in. ”

“The moment Xu Yao opened the door, she saw mother he, who was crying her eyes out. ”

“Seeing this, Xu Yao’s lips curled up without a trace. However, in the blink of an eye, her expression changed to one of sadness. “What’s wrong, Auntie? Did something happen to Ziteng?” ”

“With his mother crying like this, it was obvious that something must have happened to he ziteng. ”

“”It’s Alright, ziteng has woken up.”His mother hugged Xu Yao excitedly. “Yaoyao, Ziteng is alright! Ziteng is Alright!” ”

What?

He ziteng is alright?

How did this happen?

What’s going on?

Why Is He Ziteng Alright?

“Xu Yao tried hard to control her emotions and pretended to be very happy. “Really? Auntie, don’t lie to me. Is Ziteng Really Alright?” ”

“”Yes, Ziteng is Alright!”Mother he held Xu Yao’s hand. “Let’s go, yaoyao. Let’s hurry to the hospital to see Ziteng.” ”

“”Okay!”Xu Yao nodded and smiled with tears in her eyes. “I have to inform doctor mi of this good news immediately. After doctor Mi hears it, he will definitely be very happy!” ”

“”Okay, quickly inform Doctor Mi!” ”

“Upon hearing Xu Yao’s call, Mi Chen’s face was also filled with disbelief. ”

He was fine!

He ziteng was actually fine!

How was this possible?

“Ye Zhuo had not even figured out the true cause of he ziteng’s illness, so how could he have cured he ziteng! ! ”

It was impossible!

He had to go to the hospital immediately to figure out the situation.

Mi Chen put down her phone and immediately rushed to the hospital.

“Half an hour later, the He family’s parents and Xu Yao arrived at the hospital. ”

“Assistant Xiao Shen was already waiting at the entrance of the hospital. “Mr. and Mrs. He, you’re here. Quickly follow me.” ”

“Mother he said in disbelief, “Assistant Xiao Shen, is ziteng really alright?” ”

“Assistant Xiao Shen smiled and said, “He’s really alright. Do you think I would joke with you about something like this?” ”

“”That’s good, that’s Good!”Mother he cried with joy. ”

Xu Yao followed behind and narrowed her eyes.

“Very soon, assistant Xiao Shen brought the few of them to a ward. “Worker he is inside. You guys should hurry in.” ”

He’s mother gulped and looked at the tightly shut door. She suddenly lost the courage to push the door open.

He’s father raised his hand and pushed the door open.

Bang.

The door was pushed open.

A tall figure stood in front of the window with his back facing them.

He’s parents immediately recognized he ziteng’s figure and rushed over crying.

“Ziteng!”

The two of them hugged he ziteng and cried out loud.

“During this period of time, they were already prepared to lose he ziteng. They did not expect that God would bring them such a surprise again. ”

“Seeing this scene, Xu Yao was stunned and took a few steps back. ” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Why did this happen?

Why didn’t He Ziteng Die?

“Not only did he ziteng not die, he even stood up. ”

Why did he ziteng recover so quickly?

What exactly happened?

“Xu Yao held the door frame tightly with both hands. Because she used too much strength, her knuckles had already turned slightly white. ”

“At this moment, a hand gently patted Xu Yao’s shoulder. Xu Yao looked up and saw Mi Chen’s face. ”

Xu Yao heaved a sigh of relief.

So what if he ziteng woke up?

“For a fool like he ziteng, if Mi Chen could kill him once, she could also kill him a second time. ”

“In any case, he ziteng didn’t know about her and Mi Chen. ”

“Xu Yao walked in with a smile and hugged he ziteng. “Ziteng, ziteng, you’re finally awake! You have no idea how worried I’ve been about you these past few days!” ”

“When he heard Xu Yao’s voice again, he ziteng felt nauseous. ”

How could he be with such a person!

He ziteng lowered his head and looked at Xu Yao who was hugging him. His gaze was very cold. “Worried about me? Worried about when I’ll die?”

“When he said this, not only was Xu Yao stunned, but even the He family’s parents were stunned. ”

Xu Yao’s face instantly turned pale.

Could it be...

He Ziteng knew something?

How could it be!

She clearly did not give herself away by he ziteng’s side.

What a joke.

He ziteng must be joking with her.

“Xu Yao suppressed the panic in her heart and pretended as if nothing had happened. She continued, “Ziteng, what kind of joke are you making! I’m really worried about you!” ”

“At this moment, mi Chen said, “Ziteng, if you don’t die, you’ll get rich later. These days, Xu Yao hasn’t eaten or slept well because of you. She’s a woman with two bodies now, so she can’t stand your jokes.” ”

“”Adulterer and adulterer!”He ziteng directly shook off Xu Yao who was hugging him. “Xu Yao, stop pretending! I know everything!” ”
