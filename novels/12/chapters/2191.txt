“With that said, Fan Mu, who originally believed in ye Zao, became very shaken. ”

Could things really be like what Wen Yang said?

“If that was really the case, then what was the difference between Ye Zao and man Xing? ”

“Although Man Wen did not ask for anything in return when he helped ye Zao, Ye Zao should not have treated man Wen this way. ”

“Wen Yang looked at fan mu. “If you’re afraid that Miss Ye doesn’t know, why don’t you go and inform Miss Ye?” ”

“You want to Die!”Fan Mu said somewhat speechlessly. “Why don’t You Go Yourself?”

“Wen Yang scratched his head. “I’m just afraid that Brother Man Wen will get angry, right?” ”

“So what if you’re afraid of Me?”Fan Mu asked.

“Wen Yang continued, “What does that have to do with me? Anyway, when the time comes, it’s you who will be scolded, not me!” ”

Fan Mu:”...”

“A moment later, fan mu continued, “If you want to go, go. I’m not going.” ”

“I’m not going either.”How would Wen Yang Dare to go?

“If more people knew about this matter, it would have been fine. However, only he and fan mu knew. If the two of them leaked any information, Man Wen would definitely know that they were the ones who leaked it. ”

“After saying this, Wen Yang sighed, “Now we can only pray that Miss Ye hasn’t forgotten about Brother Man Wen.” ”

Fan Mu looked up at the sky and felt that this prayer was a little mysterious. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“If ye Zhuo really would help, he wouldn’t have waited until now. ”

Man Wen could only rely on himself now.

On the other side.

Ye Shu and Lin Jincheng were preparing to leave in a few days.

“Before they went back, the couple planned to buy some high-tech products to bring back. ”

“While they were shopping at the store, they saw Bai Mo shopping as well. ”

“Although they knew that Bai Mo and Lin Ze’s matter didn’t work out, Ye Shu had a good influence on Bai Mo, so they took the initiative to greet her. “Miss Bai.” ”

“Hearing this, Bai Mo looked up and smiled. “Auntie, are you here to buy something too?” ”

“Ye Shu nodded. “I’m preparing to go back in a few days, so I’m going out for a walk with your uncle.” ”

“”Oh,”Bai Mo continued, “Uncle, Auntie, are you going back so soon?” ”

“”Yeah, we’ve been out for quite a long time. There are still a lot of things waiting for us to deal with at home,”ye Shu continued, “Oh right, your uncle and I are going out for dinner. Do you want to go out for dinner?” ”

“Bai Mo tactfully refused, “Thank you, Auntie. I’ve already eaten.” ”

“”Alright then,”ye Shu continued, “Your uncle and I will be leaving first.” ”

“Okay.”

Ye Shu and Lin Jincheng turned around and left.

“Li Wei looked at Bai Mo and asked curiously, “Who was that just now?” ”

“”Lin Ze’s parents,”Bai Mo replied. ”

“Li Wei nodded. “No Wonder I asked if you had eaten! As I said, Lin Ze’s parents are indeed pretty good-looking. No Wonder Lin Ze is so handsome!” ”

“If it weren’t for Lin Ze’s low status, Li Wei would have wanted to marry him. ”

Unfortunately.

“In this world, there was no such thing as having the best of both worlds ”

“Bai Mo said, “Being handsome doesn’t mean you can eat.”It could be seen that ye Shu had a very good impression of her. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have greeted her so warmly. ”

“Not only that, Bai Mo also felt that ye Shu didn’t know her own limits. ”

“It was not that she did not know Lin Ze’s identity. She could not daydream just because her daughter had some abilities, right? ”

Ye Zhuoyou could not represent Lin Ze.

“You’re right.”Li Wei nodded.

Interstellar prison.

“Across a protective wall, man Xing met her parents. ”

“In just a short ten days or so, her parents seemed to have changed. ”

“Especially man Jiangshan, both of his sideburns’hair had already turned white. ”

“Mom and Dad.”

“Xing ‘er.”Man Jiangshan was still calm.

“Zhao Dan pounced on her. If not for the protective wall, she would have jumped into Zhao Dan’s arms by now, “Xing ‘er, you’re finally here! Hurry up and think of a way to get mom out of this damn place! I really don’t want to stay here any longer! I want to go out, Xing ‘er!” ”

“”Mom, calm down.”Seeing his mother like this, man Xing’s eyes were a little red. “Things have already become like this. You and dad should properly reform inside. Don’t worry, I will take good care of Man Wen.” ”

“Man Jiangshan said, “Xing ‘er, what you’re doing is right! Ignore your mother! Now is the most critical moment for you. Don’t let us affect you! It’s only ten years? I can handle it!”Manjiangshan had been in that position for so many years, of course he knew what Manxing was facing! ”
