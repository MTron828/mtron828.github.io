“There were a total of ten grills downstairs. Under normal circumstances, three or four people would work together to grill together. ”

It was a good opportunity to give song Chenyu and Cen Shaoqing a chance to be alone together.

“Song Chenyu was a little embarrassed. “Yuyan, how can I be as good as you say?” ”

In fact.

Song Chenyu’s cooking skills were indeed not bad.

“In order to have the chance to show off in front of Cen Shaoqing, she had specially followed the chef to study her cooking skills. ”

Hard work pays off.

She had finally waited until today.

She knew that her culinary skills would not be learned in vain.

“Cen Shaoqing was lowering his head to study the barbecue sauce. When he heard this, his thin lips parted slightly. “It’s not convenient. You guys can go somewhere else.” ”

Cen Yuyan’s face stiffened.

It was the second time.

This was the second time Cen Shaoqing had rejected her.

“In front of Song Chenyu, Cen Yuyan felt a little embarrassed. ”

“However, she did not dare to say anything. ”

“Song Chenyu held Cen Yuyan’s arm and said with a smile, “Yuyan, it’s indeed your inconsiderate consideration. Fifth Master and Miss ye are having a barbecue together. Aren’t the two of us here to be third wheel? Come, let’s go over there to look for Lu Xiu.” ”

“”You’re right.”Cen Yuyan could only walk down the steps with a smile. “Shaoqing, then Chenyu and I will go over there.” ”

“Okay.”

Cen Yuyan and song Chenyu walked over to Lu Xiu’s side.

“Song Chenyu said in a low voice, “Yuyan, we agreed that I would come over today to set you and Lu Xiu up. Why do you keep pushing me to fifth master’s side?” ”

“Cen Yuyan said somewhat gloomily, “I Just Can’t Stand Ye Zao!” ”

She was also a little jealous.

“As a proud daughter of the heavens, Cen Yuyan had never been jealous of anyone. ”

Ye Zao was the first.

“She thought that she didn’t lose to ye Zao in any way, but Cen Shaoqing and Lu Xiu seemed to be blind. Ye Zao was the only one in their eyes. ”

“Song Chenyu smiled lightly and said, “Yuyan, do you mind the relationship between Lu Xiu and Miss Ye?” ”

Cen Yuyan frowned.

Yes.

She really did mind.

She couldn’t accept that the person she liked worshipped another woman so much.

“Moreover, that person was the person she hated the most. ”

She felt that ye Zhuo wasn’t worthy of Lu Xiu’s worship.

“Moreover, Ye Zhuo was only nineteen this year. ”

A nineteen-year-old child. What right did she have to have such a great achievement in the Science and Technology World?

“Song Chenyu continued, “Actually, you don’t have to care about these things. Lu Xiu only idolizes miss ye. There’s no love between a man and a woman. It’s said that there’s a veil between a woman and a man. As long as you work hard, I believe you’ll definitely be able to get Lu Xiu.” ”

“After saying this, song chenyu continued, “Actually, don’t look at how Lu Xiu doesn’t like to talk. He’s actually cold on the outside but warm on the inside. Once he accepts you, you’ll know!” ”

“Lu Xiu had liked song Chenyu for so many years, so song Chenyu naturally understood Lu Xiu. ”

“If Cen Shaoqing hadn’t suddenly appeared in song Chenyu’s world, perhaps she and Lu Xiu would have had a fruitful relationship by now. ”

Cen Shaoqing’s appearance let song Chenyu know.

What did it mean that there was always someone better.

“Hearing this, Cen Yuyan’s eyes lit up. “Really?” ”

“Song Chenyu nodded. “Of course it’s true! I grew up with Lu Xiu, how could I not know him?” ”

“Cen Yuyan continued to ask, “Then do you know if Lu Xiu liked anyone in the past?” ”

“Song Chenyu shook his head. “I’m not too sure about that either. At least for all the years I’ve known him, he has never confessed to any girl, nor has he ever been with any girl.” ”

“Cen Yuyan’s eyes became brighter and brighter. “Lu Xiu really doesn’t have a girl he likes?”Although Cen Yuyan had many relationships, she still hoped that her boyfriend would stay clean. ”

“Now that she knew that Lu Xiu had never been in a relationship and didn’t have a cinnabar mole, Cen Yuyan was naturally happy. ”

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “Yuyan, when have I ever lied to You?” ”

“”Chenyu, then I’ll leave my matters to you.” ” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Song Chenyu nodded. “Your matters are my matters.”

“Cen Yuyan continued, “I’m three years older than Lu Xiu. Do you think Lu Xiu will mind my age?” ”

“”A girl in her third year carries a golden brick.”Song Chenyu patted Cen Yuyan’s hand, “Yuyan, you’re so beautiful. Age Isn’t a problem at all. Moreover, Lu Xiu has never said that he doesn’t like girls who are older than him.” ”

“Really? Lu Xiu really doesn’t mind that his girlfriend is older than him?”
