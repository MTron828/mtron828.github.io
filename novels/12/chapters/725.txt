Chapter 726: 160: Meeting Song Shiyu in Yun Jing! 3

Translator: 549690339

This was song Shiyu.

“Brother Song!”Ye Zhuo did not expect to meet song Shiyu on his first day back in Yun Jing.

“Song Shiyu continued, “When did you come back?””

“I just got home this afternoon.”Ye Zhuo handed song Shiyu a strawberry milkshake. “Do you want some milk tea?”

“Thank you.”

“Ye Zhuo thought that song Shiyu would refuse. After all, boys did not really like strawberry-flavored drinks. He did not expect that not only did song Shiyu not refuse, he even inserted a tube into it and took a sip.”

“It tastes good.”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “So you also like strawberry milkshakes.””

Strawberry Milkshake?

“Song Shiyu secretly remembered this name. “Yes, I’ve always liked to drink it.””

“Ye Zhuo continued, “I also quite like to drink it.””

“Song Shiyu took another sip of the strawberry milkshake and said, “How have you been in Beijing recently?””

“Pretty good.”Ye Zao nodded. “How About You?”

“Same old.”Song Shiyu didn’t have any special expression on his face.

The two of them talked as they walked forward.

“Lin Ze was waiting for ye Zao not far ahead. When he saw that there was an additional person beside ye Zao, he looked at Ye Zao with some confusion.”

“When he saw Lin Ze, song Shiyu also had some doubts.”

“Ye Zao took the initiative to introduce him. “Brother song, this is my brother, Lin Ze. Brother, this is my friend, Brother Song.””

“Song Shiyu knew a little about what happened to ye Zao in Beijing, but it was his first time meeting Lin Ze.”

Song Shiyu nodded at Lin Ze. “Hello.”

Lin Ze followed ye Zao and called him Brother Song.

“Ye Zao passed the Oolong tea to Lin Ze and looked up at song Shiyu. “Brother song, it’s getting late. Why Don’t you come with me to my house for a simple meal?””

“Ye Zhuo truly treated song Shiyu as a friend. Moreover, she felt that song Shiyu was a little familiar.”

It was as if...

She had seen him somewhere before.

“Song Shiyu smiled and said, “Then I’ll be impolite.””

“Let’s go.”

“The two-person line became a three-person line. Song Shiyu continued, “Ye Zhuo, are you and your brother Twins?””

Ye Zhuo nodded. “Yes.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“The two of you look very similar.”

Ye Zao smiled slightly. “That’s what everyone says.”

“Not long after, they arrived at the Ye residence.”

Ye Shu was busy in the kitchen while Lin Jincheng was changing a light bulb.

“The house had not been occupied for more than half a year. Although Zhou Yuelian would often come to clean, because Zhou Yuelian always came during the day, she did not know that the light bulb was broken.”

Ye Zhuo took out disposable slippers for song Shiyu to change into.

This was song Shiyu’s first time coming to the Ye residence.

“After changing into the slippers, Ye Zhuo came into the house and introduced song Shiyu to Ye Shu and Lin Jincheng.”

“Song Shiyu said, “Uncle, Auntie, I’m sorry to disturb you. You can just call me Xiao Song.””

“Ye Shu was a hospitable person. She smiled and said, “Xiao Song, please have a seat. We just came back today and the house is a little messy. Don’t mind us.””

“”Auntie, you’re too polite.””

“Lin Jincheng brought over a cup of tea. “Little song, have some tea.””

“”Thank you, Uncle.”Song Shiyu immediately stood up and took the Teacup with both hands.”

“Lin Jincheng smiled and said, “Don’t stand on ceremony here.””

The Ye family was very harmonious.

“The father was the father, the mother was the mother, the brother was the brother, and the sister was the sister.”

Song Shiyu looked at the busy family and a warmth that he had never seen before appeared in his eyes.

“When he was very, very young, he also wished that he could have a happy family like this.”

Unfortunately.

He had not even waited for this day before he fell into the infernal hell.

“Thinking of this, song Shiyu’s eyes deepened. He put down the Teacup and went to the balcony to help ye Zhuo and Lin ze choose vegetables.”

“Ye Zhuo looked up slightly. “Brother Song, you’re a guest. I don’t need your help here. My brother and I can do it.”This was probably song Shiyu’s first time choosing vegetables, ye Zhuo watched helplessly as he threw the best part of the vegetables into the trash can.”

“Song Shiyu said, “It’s alright.””

Ye Zhuo passed the potatoes and a knife to song Shiyu. “Then peel the potatoes.”Ye Zhuo really couldn’t bear for song Shiyu to harm the vegetables.

“Song Shiyu took the potatoes. For the first time in his life, he felt troubled. He didn’t know where to start with the potatoes.”

“His hands had won against the King of gamblers in C Nation. He had been stained with blood, but he had never peeled the potatoes.”

“In fact, no one dared to let song shiyu peel the potatoes.”

“Ye Zhuo saw song Shiyu’s dilemma. He picked up a potato and showed it to song Shiyu. “Come, I’ll teach you. Do this first, then do this again.””

Song Shiyu looked at it very seriously. He had finally learned the technique of peeling potatoes.

“Half an hour later, the three of them selected the dishes and took them to the kitchen.”
