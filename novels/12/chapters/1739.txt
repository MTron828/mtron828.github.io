The Glory of C Nation?

“Feng Qi was clearly a Chinese, but now he had become the glory of C Nation. Wasn’t this a joke? ”

“The old lady looked at Camilla. “Scientific research does not differentiate between national boundaries, but one must know propriety, justice, and shame!” ”

“China had nurtured Feng Qi, and fifth master Cen had given Feng Qi a chance to enter the scientific research world! ”

“It could be said that without China, without fifth master Cen, there would be no Feng Qi. ”

But what had Feng Qi done?

Jamila’s expression did not change. He had originally thought that Feng Qi’s mother was a very ordinary Chinese old lady.

He had not expected that this old lady was much different than he had imagined.

Feng Qi had defected very easily. It was obvious that this old lady was much more courageous than Feng Qi.

“In comparison, Feng Qi did not look like the old lady’s flesh and blood at all. ”

“”Old Lady, there is another saying called ‘judging the situation’. We are born with the ability to judge the situation! Professor Feng just made the right choice.” Jamila paused, then, she continued, “Professor Feng is a rare talent in the scientific research field. Her sacrifice made us all very sad! “When she was alive, she was most worried about you as a mother, so she specially left her last words, asking me to bring you to country C to retire. Although your daughter is no longer here, in the future, all of us will be your children! “We will be responsible for your retirement.” ”

This was Gamira’s true goal.

“The old lady held the National Treasure of the Song dynasty in her hands. As long as she brought the old lady to Country C, it would be the same as obtaining the National Treasure of the Song dynasty. ”

“Camilla looked at the expression on the old lady’s face and continued, “Oh right, there’s also your granddaughter Feng Ying. Feng Ying misses you very much! She has asked us again and again to bring you over to live a comfortable life!” ”

Feng Ying?

“If Feng Ying really had a grandmother like her in her eyes, she would not have waited until now. ”

“”I thank you for your good intentions.”The old lady’s attitude was very firm, “But I still say that no matter what, I will never leave my country! If you are here for this matter, don’t waste any more time. The door is right there, please.” ”

“Although she was old, she was not old enough to be unreasonable. ”

Wanting her to leave China!

Impossible!

“Seeing the old lady like this, Gamila was stunned again. ”

This was completely different from what she had imagined.

He had thought that the old lady would definitely agree to his words.

“When one was old, one’s greatest wish was to be able to be together with their children and grandchildren. Now that Feng Qi was dead, Feng Ying was the only family member of the old lady. ”

But the old lady directly refused!

Could it be...

“That compared to going to country C, this old lady wanted more material subsidies? ”

“Thinking of this, Gamira narrowed her eyes, then she said, “Old Lady, you’re already old, after all. It’s definitely not convenient for you to live alone in China. “After all, country C has your family. Not only Feng Ying, in the future, everyone in country C’s research institute will be your family. “Professor Feng is no longer here, and we will be filial to her together. If you insist on not coming back with us, professor Feng will also be worried over there.” ”

“The corners of the old lady’s mouth curled up slightly as she looked at Gamila. “Tell me, what is your motive? Don’t beat around the bush with an old woman like me.” ” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Gamila was a little surprised, but she did not show it on her face at all, “Old Lady, you have misunderstood. We do not have any motive. “If there is a motive, then our only motive is to replace Professor Feng and give you good respect so that you can live a happy and happy old age. This is the motive of all of us.” ”

“Jamila’s words were extremely beautiful. If it was anyone else, they would have been deceived by these flowery words! ”

They had to be filial!

They also had to spend a happy old age. One had to know that the old lady was an old woman who had lost her independence. The biggest temptation for an old woman who had lost her independence was to spend a happy old age with many children and grandchildren.

Unfortunately.

The old lady sitting across from Jamila had a clear mind and was absolutely patriotic. She had a strong sense of belonging!

“The corner of the old lady’s mouth still maintained a smile, “Don’t look at me like I’m old, but I’m not muddle-headed. Young Man, don’t be angry if I say something. “From the moment you stood there, I knew that you definitely had a motive! “But what I can’t figure out is, what is it about me, this rotten old woman, that is worth you guys putting in so much effort for?” ”
