Lian Mai succeeded.

“An exquisite baby face appeared on the screen. “Hello, senior leaf.” ”

“Hello.”

Little Yu’er had joined Miao Yin platform three months ago. She was a retired national player and had started learning chess at the age of seven.

“In the past three months, Little Yu’er had challenged many chess live streamers and had yet to lose. ”

“Because of this record, Little Yu’er was now firmly known as the second elder sister of the live broadcast world. ”

“If she could be the first elder sister, who would be willing to be the second elder sister? ”

“Therefore, after watching ye Zao’s two live broadcasts, Little Yu’er decided to send ye Zao a PK invitation. ”

As long as she could defeat ye Zao.

She would be the first elder sister in the future.

She had carefully observed ye Zao’s go style.

“She realized that ye Zao’s go moves were not very clear, and he did not have a plan either. Every move he made was his own. Being able to become the first elder sister was just luck. ”

“Little Yu’er revealed a smile. “Senior Ye, I’ve been watching your livestream since last year. I’m your loyal fan.” ”

“[ ah Ah Ah, so little Yu’er likes our ye Zao too. ] ”

[ I’m in love. I’m going to follow her. ]

[ I’m going too. ]

“Seeing that many of ye Zao’s fans were climbing over the wall to follow her, the smile on Little Yu’er’s face became even more intense. ”

“After she won against Ye Zao, Ye Zao’s 90 million fans would probably lose half of their fans. ”

“Thank you for liking it.”Ye Zao controlled the game to enter the game page. “Let’s begin.”

“Okay.”

The system automatically divided the pieces.

Ye Zao was given the black pieces.

“Little Yu’er said a little embarrassedly, “Senior, I’ll start first then.” ”

“Let’s begin.”

The PK officially began.

“In order to win against Ye Zao, Little Yu’er specially made a set of plans and followed the plan. In a short while, she had already eaten a car full of ye Zao’s guns. ”

“Looking at ye Zao’s side, she did not even get a small soldier to eat. ”

“However, the fans were not anxious. ”

This was because this was ye Zao’s usual routine.

“In the end, Ye Zao would definitely be able to turn defeat into victory! ”

“Little Yu’er naturally knew of ye Zao’s tactics, so she was not in a hurry. She continued to follow the plan and ate ye Zao’s taxi. ”

“Seeing that she was about to win, Little Yu’er’s eyes were filled with excitement. ”

Ye Zao moved the soldier one step closer.

“Little Yu’er moved a cannon. “A general with two cannons has no son. Senior, thank you for letting me win.” ” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Eat.”Ye Zao jumped over and ate the cannon behind him.

Xiao Yu’er’s face turned pale. Only then did she realize that this was a trap set by ye Zao.

She did not expect ye Zao to be able to break the dual cannon general’s situation.

Those who knew chess knew that the dual cannon general would definitely die.

[ ye Zi 666666! ]

[ the user’s dog: give out a sports car. ]

[ the sky-toppling Purple Gold Hammer 1225: give out a peerless beauty. ]

[666666! ]

Xiao Yu’er narrowed her eyes and tried her best to calm herself down.

She had only lost one cannon.

She had taken all of Ye Zao’s cars and cannons.

She was still the one who had the upper hand now.

“Xiao Yu’er smiled and said, “Senior, you are really amazing. You can even crack the double cannon general.” ”

“It’s no big deal.”Ye Zao’s tone was indifferent.

No Big Deal?

What did ye Zao Mean?

Xiao Yu’er had seen conceited people before.

She had never seen someone as conceited as ye Zao.

She had to defeat ye Zao.

Xiao Yu’er continued to take the next step.

Ye Zao also took a small step.

“At this moment, she received a message. ”

It was from Li Shang.

“[ President Ye, are you free to meet tomorrow? ] ”

Ye Zao operated the mouse with one hand and replied to the message with his phone in the other. [ yes. ]

[ then I will wait for you at the usual place at 10 o’clock tomorrow morning. ]

“[ Okay. ] When the message was sent, it was Hei Zi’s turn to leave. Ye Zao casually moved the elephant a step and ate the other side’s pawn. ”

Little Yu’er looked at the situation on the chessboard and her heart was beating fast.

She was tricked.

Ye Zao was tricked.

“In order to win against Ye Zao, she specially dug a trap. ”

Using a pawn to exchange for a general was simply too straightforward.

“When she set up the trap, Little Yu’er was still worried that ye Zao would see through it. ”

Now it seemed that.

Ye Zao’s chess skills were only so-so. He could not even see through such an obvious trap.

Little Yu’er covered the smile on her lips very well and continued to carry out the next trap.

She would definitely make ye Zao admit defeat.

“After sending the message, ye Zao put his phone aside and looked at the screen, continuing the live broadcast. ”

“[ ye, you seemed to have made a wrong move. ] ”

[ F * ck! F * ck! The other party is going to be the general! ]

“[ ye, you’re not going to lose, are you? ] ”

“Looking at the words on the bullet screen, ye Zao finally reacted. He had just focused on sending a message to Li Shang and made a wrong move. ”

“Chess was closely linked. One wrong move, one wrong move. ”

“At this moment, the situation on the chessboard was in a dilemma. ”

The first step was death.

The second step was retreat or death.

Ye Zhuo’s lips curled up slightly.

Interesting.

“She liked smart opponents the most. Since the other party wanted to trick her, she would grant her one chance. ”

Little Yu’er stared at the chess board closely.

Vault.

It had to be the vault horse.

“Once ye Zao jumped the horse, she would be the general. ”

Ye Zao controlled the mouse and moved the horse over.

Okay.

This was great.

Little Yu’er was so excited that her heart was about to jump out of her chest.

The Vault Horse.

Ye Zao finally jumped the horse.

“Little Yu’er immediately moved the carriage over and ate ye Zao’s horse, facing the general directly! ”

“F * ck! It’s a trap!”

“This little Yu’er seems to be a little powerful.”

“Is she trying to become a full-fledged sister?”

“What’s going on with Ye?”

“”Go, Ye!” ”

“”Ye, hang in there! Don’t Lose!” ”

“”Go, Ye.” ”

“Ever since ye Zao’s live broadcast, he had never lost to anyone. ”

“This was the first time he was at a disadvantage. Seeing that he was about to lose, his fans were all very anxious. ”

Ye Zao’s eyebrows and eyes were light. “Don’t panic. Let’s see how dad will defeat the enemy in one move.”
