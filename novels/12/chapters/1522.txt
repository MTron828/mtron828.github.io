Chapter 1523: 321: Who Was Dad Afraid of? 4

Translator: 549690339

“As soon as this announcement was made, Cara and the other research doctorates from five other countries were confused. They didn’t understand what ye Zao was up to.”

They thought that YC was afraid of the terms of the bet and didn’t dare to sign the contract because it would cost too much. They didn’t expect that the new terms were even scarier than the previous one!

Was there something wrong with YC’s brain?

Would someone complain that they had not lost thoroughly enough?

Could it be that YC still thought that they could win?

What a joke!

“Dr. Cara looked at the other people. “If you think that there is nothing wrong with it, then we will sign it.””

“Sure.”Tina nodded.

“Gadomi said, “Cut the Gordian knot. If you want to sign it, hurry up and make an appointment with YC so that YC won’t regret it!””

Orvis nodded. “The two professors are right. I agree with what they said!”

“Carla looked at the crowd and continued, “Since everyone has no objections, let’s sign an electronic agreement first. Then, we can discuss the meeting with YC.””

Signing an electronic version of such a gambling agreement was not enough. Both parties had to personally meet and stamp it!

“After ye Zhuo’s latest statement was released, there was another wave of ridicule on the international network.”

[ I thought YC had become smarter. I didn’t expect that a fool would still be a fool! ]

[ maybe she thought that she could complete the two-year agreement? ]

“After all, as long as China could complete the aircraft carrier project on time, China would have the management rights of the scientific research community of the other six countries.”

“Once they obtained this authority, no one would dare to claim that China was number one in the scientific community in the future!”

“[ complete the aircraft carrier project? Not to mention two years, even if they were given two hundred years, they might not be able to complete it! ]”

[ let’s wait until China can create a spaceship on its own. ]

[ in your dreams. ]

“Despite the discussions on the Internet, Ye Zhuo still signed an electronic agreement with them and agreed that they would officially meet to sign the agreement three days later.”

“At the same time, the people from the Cen family base were in an uproar.”

A few elders did not agree with Ye Zao’s plan.

“”Fifth master, you have to think twice! Back then, it was not easy for you to develop the base to such an extent. Do you want to watch Miss Ye lose it to a foreign country?””

“”Fifth Master! Previously, I didn’t care how Miss Ye made a fuss. But now, it has seriously affected the base. We really can’t just stand by and watch.””

“”No matter what, we can’t use the CEN base to gamble for her!””

“Cen Shaoqing sat on the boss’s chair, holding a Buddhist bead in one hand and a Buddhist scripture in the other. The air was filled with the faint Buddhist music, “Great Sorrow Mantra.”.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“After listening to everyone’s speech, Cen Shaoqing raised his eyes slightly and opened his thin lips, “Uncles and the base have grown up together. It has been through storms and storms for more than ten years. I can understand your feelings. I believe in Ye Zhuo, so please believe in her as well. After spending so much time with her, I believe that she is not the kind of person who would joke about the Cen Family!””

Cen Shaoqing was still so stubborn at this point in time.

“Just because he believed in ye Zao, he could make ye Zao joke about the future of the Cen Family?”

“China’s technology was still developing. If the management rights were seized by others at this point in time, China’s technology would never be able to stand out!”

“They did this not only for the sake of the Cen family base, but also for the sake of the entire China’s technology!”

How could CEN Shaoqing not understand! !

“Previously, Cen Shaoqing ate vegetarian and chanted Buddhism, and his methods of handling matters were harsh. He did not expect such a shrewd person to be delayed by love.”

“If he did not see it with his own eyes, who would believe that the dignified CEN fifth master would also have such a day!”

No wonder people said that the IQ of men and women in Love was zero.

“According to the current situation, Cen Shaoqing probably did not even have a zero IQ.”

His IQ was now a negative number!

“”Fifth master,”Sun Qi walked forward and said hesitantly, “I know that you and Miss ye have a deep relationship. But this can’t be the basis for you to believe her. Creating an aircraft carrier is far more difficult than you think. It Can’t be built successfully just by saying it!””

“At this point, Sun Qi frowned, “I heard that Miss Ye doesn’t even know how to store a nuclear reactor. How would she know how to build an aircraft carrier? “Master Five, the BET agreement has not been signed yet. You still have room for negotiation. Once the contract is signed, there will be no room for regret! “Please Think Twice Before You Act!””
