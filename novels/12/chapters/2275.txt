“Elder bai continued, “Let me ask you one more question. Where is Jingshu?” ”

“Zhou Ying’s heart trembled, but she still pretended as if nothing had happened. She continued, “Dad, didn’t I tell you before? Jingshu might have gone to Earth. I’m not too sure either.” ”

“”Good! Good! Very good!”Elder Bai pointed at Zhou Ying and said, “Zhou Ying, you’re too good! Where is Bai Jiacheng? Tell that unfilial son to get the hell out!” ”

“”Dad, What’s going on? Sit down and have a drink. Let’s talk about it slowly! Who exactly made you unhappy?”Zhou Ying looked like she was submissive to her daughter-in-law. ”

“If outsiders saw it, they would really think that elder Bai was being unreasonable. ”

“Elder bai continued, “Tell Bai Jiacheng to get out!” ”

“”Jiacheng isn’t at home either,”Zhou Ying answered. ”

“Where the hell is he?”Old Master Bai suppressed the anger in his heart.

“Zhou Ying was also a little unhappy and continued, “Dad, I know you have always looked down on jiasheng, but Jiasheng is your eldest son after all...” ”

“Cut the crap!”Old Master Bai slammed the table and stood up. “Hurry up and tell Bai Jiasheng to get his ass back here!”

“Zhou Ying was shocked and stood up from her chair. “Dad, Dad, don’t worry. I’ll contact him right away.” ”

“After receiving Zhou Ying’s call, Bai Jiasheng immediately rushed back. ”

Zhou Ying stood at the door and waited for Bai Jiasheng.

“After about ten minutes, they finally saw Bai Jiasheng’s flying machine. ”

Zhou Ying immediately went up to him. “You’re finally back! Your Dad Is Like Crazy!”

“What’s Going On?”Bai jiasheng frowned.

Zhou Ying shook her head. “How would I know what’s going on? He’s mad at me as soon as he gets home!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Hearing that, Bai Jiasheng frowned. According to his understanding of the old man, the old man was never a person who would get angry at random unless something really happened. ”

“”Apart from getting angry, did my dad say anything else?”Bai Jiasheng continued to ask. ”

“Zhou Ying continued, “He asked me if Jingshu was at home the moment he arrived...” ”

Zhou Ying’s expression changed when she said this. “Do you think your dad knows something?”

“It’s possible!”Bai Jiasheng said.

“Zhou Ying continued, “Then what should we do?” ”

Bai Jiasheng walked in. “Let’s take it one step at a time. Old Master might not be here for this. Let’s not scare ourselves.”

“Okay.”Zhou Ying nodded.

The two walked to the hall.

Old Master Bai sat on the chair in the head seat.

“Bai Jiacheng walked over with a smile. “Dad, you’re here! I heard from Zhou Ying that you’re looking for me. I wonder what it is?” ”

“Don’t you know what you’ve done?”Old Master Bai asked.

“Bai Jiacheng said, “Dad, don’t joke with me. Just tell me what it is.” ”

Old Master Bai looked at Bai Jiacheng and suddenly felt a little sad. He didn’t know when Bai Jiacheng had become like this.

How could he even do this to his own daughter?

“Where’s Jingshu?”Bai Jiacheng asked.

“Because he had just spoken to Zhou Ying, Bai Jiacheng wasn’t in a hurry, he continued, “Jingshu is your granddaughter who you’ve watched grow up with your own eyes. You should know her personality better than I do. If you want to find her, you shouldn’t come home. You should go to Earth. That place is almost her second home!” ”

“Is that so?”Elder Bai asked.

“”Of course!”Bai Jiacheng nodded. “Dad, I heard that you haven’t been feeling well recently. Look, I specially asked someone to buy this special medicine for you in Galaxy F. You can try it.” ”

Elder Bai looked at Bai Jiacheng. “I’ll ask you one last time. Where is Jingshu?”

“”Dad, I already said that she’s not at home.” ”

“”Since you won’t tell me, I’ll have to find her myself!”With that, grandfather Bai stood up from his seat and walked upstairs. ”

“Bai Jiasheng’s heart skipped a beat, and he immediately followed in grandfather Bai’s footsteps. ”

“He absolutely couldn’t let grandfather Bai find out that he had locked Bai Jingshu up. Otherwise, this matter wouldn’t be so easy to resolve. ”

“”Dad, What are you doing?”Bai Jiasheng grabbed old master Bai’s arm. “As parents, would we harm our children?” ”

“Do you know what’s going on? !”Old Master Bai glared at Bai Jiasheng and then fiercely shook off Bai Jiasheng’s hand.

“Old Master Bai had practiced martial arts when he was young. Although he was old and his body was not in good shape, his skills were still there when it came to fighting. ”
