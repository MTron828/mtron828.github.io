“At this moment, Yi Lai seemed to have thought of something. “Sister Qiao, have you seen Xiao Fu before? Why is she so familiar with Xiao Fu?” ”

“When he said this, Yi Lai also felt that something was wrong. ”

Could it be...

“At this moment, Li Zi Yue continued to speak, interrupting their train of thought. “Xiao Fu, put on the human skin mask first.” ”

“”Okay.”Sun Xiao Qian nodded, took out the human skin mask from her pocket, and put it on her face. ”

“However, in the blink of an eye, Sun Xiao Qian became Zhou Qing. ”

The two brothers were extremely surprised. “Oh my God! Sister Qiao is too amazing! She’s practically alone!”

Sun Xiao Qian was a little worried. She touched her face. “But can this really pass the detector?”

Every door had face recognition.

“If she was found to be a fake Zhou Qing, the consequences would be unimaginable. ”

“After all, a fake was a fake. ”

A face detector was not something that could be fooled by wearing a human skin mask.

“This is for you.”Li Ziyue took out a bottle of blue potion from his pocket and threw it to Sun Xiaoqian.

“Sun Xiaoqian took it with both hands and asked curiously, “What is this?” ” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“”Stabilizer.”Li Ziyue continued, “This thing is very precious. There’s only one bottle. You should use it sparingly.” ”

“It can help me recognize faces?”

“Yes.”Li Ziyue nodded.

“It was also given by Sister Qiao?”Sun Xiaoqian asked.

Li Ziyue nodded.

Sun Xiaoqian rubbed his chin. “I feel more and more that sister Qiao was disguised by Miss Ye.”

“I think so too!”Two to go said excitedly.

“One to two to go, these two brothers’lives were saved by ye Zao from a level three armored beast. ”

“Therefore, when they heard that ye Zao was Qiao Yi, the two of them were abnormally excited. They could not wait to put the hammer down right away. ”

They could not believe that such a good miss ye was gone just like that.

“Sun Xiaoqian said, “Don’t think too much about it. How are we going to deal with the one inside?” ”

The one inside naturally referred to the unconscious Zhou Qing.

“Li Ziyue continued, “Have you changed the clothes that sister Qiao gave her?” ”

“Yes.”Sun Xiaoqian nodded.

“”Get it out,”Li Ziyue continued. ”

“Okay.”

Sun Xiaoqian walked to the cubicle and dragged Zhou Qing out.

Zhou Qing was wearing Joey’s clothes.

“As if she had realized something, she raised her head and said, “I know! Brother Li, you also want to put a piece of sister Qiao’s human skin mask on Zhou Qing’s face, don’t you?” ”

“Li Ziyue was a little speechless and said, “Do you think that a human skin mask is a piece of waste paper? Can Everyone Have One?” ”

“”Then what do you want to Do?”First, he scratched his head. He did not know what Li Ziyue’s intention was. ”

“Second, he also felt that it was a little strange. ”

Even Sun Xiaoqian thought that Li Ziyue wanted to take out a human skin mask and make Zhou Qing look like Joey.

“After all, Zhou Qing’s clothes were all changed. ”

Li Ziyue took out a small box from his pocket slowly.

“When he opened the box, there was a small white bug lying inside. ”

“The bug was not big, but it was chubby and looked quite cute. ”

“What is this?”Sun Xiaoqian stretched out a little finger and poked it.

“Seeing this, Li Ziyue was shocked and immediately took Sun Xiaoqian’s hand away. “Little aunt! This thing can’t be touched!” ”

“What is this?”Sun Xiao Fu asked.

“Without waiting for Li Zi Yue to answer, he said, “Did sister Qiao give it to you?” ”

“”Yes.”Li Zi Yue nodded, “This thing is called a Gu worm on earth, it can help us solve our current predicament.” ”

“”Gu Worm?”Sun Xiao Fu continued, “What is a Gu worm? Is it that precious? You Can’t even touch it?” ”

“Li Zi Yue did not explain, he turned around and said: “Open Zhou Qing’s mouth.” ”

“”OH.”He nodded and immediately grabbed Zhou Qing’s jaw, forcing her to open her mouth. ”

“Li Zi Yue half squatted down, tilting the box containing the Gu worm towards Zhou Qing’s mouth. ”

“Just as the three of them were not sure what Li Zi Yue was doing, they saw a white gu worm crawling into Zhou Qing’s mouth. ”

“This scene made first come, second go and Sun Xiao Qian speechless! ”

“Brother Li! What are you trying to do!”Second go could not help but ask.

“Li Zi Yue stretched out his index finger to his lips, “Shh.” ”

“What is it?”First come asked.

Li Zi Yue did not say anything.

“Right at this moment, first come looked at Zhou Qing’s face, his pupils dilated. ”

“Zhou Qing’s face is slowly twisted, the expression of pain, but a few seconds, Zhou Qing’s facial features have become another person’s facial features. ”
