“After ye Zao’s guidance, her current marksmanship was very good. ”

She almost hit every shot.

“It was very hot in the waiting area. Bai Xiaosu was sweating profusely after not practicing for a while. His mouth was dry and his tongue was parched. He glanced at the water on the table beside him. Just as he was about to reach for it, he remembered ye Zao’s words. ”

She could not drink the water inside.

“However, she was too thirsty. ”

“The water was unopened. She should be fine after a sip, right? ”

Could it be that someone could poison the unopened water?

Bai Xiaosu felt that ye Zao was being too cautious.

“After all, it did not feel good to be thirsty. ”

“Bai Xiaosu licked his lips. When he saw that the Korean contestant was drinking the water happily, he suddenly felt even more thirsty. ”

“He wasn’t afraid of anything. He was just afraid of what might happen. If she drank the water, what if she was found out to be problematic? ”

“After struggling for a long time, Bai Xiaosu still didn’t reach out for the water. ”

There were still ten minutes before the competition started.

Bai Xiaosu couldn’t help but feel thirsty.

There were so many people drinking water at the venue. She only took a sip. Nothing would happen to her. Bai Xiaosu took a deep breath and walked over to get the water.

“At this moment, a Japanese contestant was one step ahead of Bai Xiaosu. He took the water from the table, opened the bottle cap, and drank it all in one gulp. ”

Bai Xiaosu was furious when she saw this scene!

“There was only one bottle of water closest to her. If she wanted to drink more water, she would have to go to Area P to get it. However, it was obvious that it was too late. ”

Bai Xiaosu had no choice but to give up on the idea of drinking water and began to line up for testing.

“Soon, a tester took out a device and began to check whether everyone had taken the banned drug. ”

The Japanese player was in front of Bai Xiaosu.

“When the Japanese player was detected, Bai Xiaosu was a little curious. ”

“If there was a problem with the water, then the Japanese player would lose the qualification to participate in the competition! ”

Beep.

“The device swept over the Japanese player, but there was nothing unusual. ”

No problem.

“Seeing this scene, Bai Xiaosu felt a little regretful. If she had known that there was no problem, she would have drank that bottle of water. ”

What if she went on stage with a dry mouth and a dry tongue? What if it affected her performance?

Bai Xiaosu’s intestines turned green with regret!

“Very soon, the test was over. ”

“There were a total of 50 people, but none of them were found to have taken illegal drugs. ”

“Although the test was over, the examiner did not ask everyone to leave. Instead, he asked everyone to continue waiting. ”

“Watching the examiner leave, Bai Xiaosu sighed and said in a low voice, “If I had known earlier, I wouldn’t have listened to Miss Ye!” ”

“At this moment, the examiner, who had already left, returned to the test room and asked loudly, “Who is Itoh Takushi?” ”

“I am!”The Japanese contestant stood out from the crowd.

“The examiner looked at Itoh Takushi and continued, “Itoh Takushi, taking illegal drugs, disqualified from this competition!” ”

“Hearing this, the faces of the contestants changed. ”

Who would have thought that someone would actually secretly take illegal drugs.

“Itoh Takujin was especially agitated. He said, “No! I haven’t taken any drugs! You are mistaken! You must be mistaken!” ”

The inspector looked at the police officers beside him. “Take him away.”

The two police officers immediately carried Itoh takujin away on both sides.

“Itoh Takozhen struggled with all his might, “I’m innocent! I’m Innocent! Let Me Go! I want to participate in the competition! Let Me Go!” ”

Itoh Takozhen was taken away and could only be replaced by temporary substitutes.

“Seeing this scene, the color on Bai Xiaosu’s face instantly disappeared, and her heart was filled with lingering fear. ”

Almost.

Just a little bit more and she would have been the one who was kicked out.

“Fortunately, there was ye Zao. ”

Bai Xiaosu regretted not drinking the water just now and was grateful to ye Zao now.

“If it were not for ye Zao, she would have drunk the bottle of water long ago. ”

“Although Jin Yuyan was sitting in the audience, she knew clearly what happened in the competition zone. ”

“Jin Yuyan narrowed her eyes. She thought that there was no mistake this time. Unexpectedly, she still miscalculated! ”

“Fortunately, she had gotten rid of one of them. ”

One less person meant one less competitor. How could this substitute compare to a professional shooter.

“As far as she knew, the shooting ability of the Japanese competitor was not weak either. ”

“Jin Yuyan comforted herself in her heart. Then, she turned her gaze to the viewing area of China. ”

Ye Zao was sitting there unscathed. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“When Jin Yuyan saw ye Zao, a dark light flashed in her eyes. ”

“This little girl from China, she would definitely make her pay the price. ”

“If she didn’t do anything, Ye Zao would think that the royal family of Korea was made of mud. ”
