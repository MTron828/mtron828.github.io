“Seeing Li Zhentian come over, Wang Tao, who was in charge of marking the papers, was also stunned. ”

“After a long while, he finally nodded. “Yes.” ”

“When he first changed the papers to full marks, Wang Tao was also full of disbelief. It was only after a few teachers checked them one by one and confirmed that there were no problems did he dare to announce this news. ”

“Li Zhentian continued, “Let me see the test paper.” ”

Wang Tao handed the test paper to Li Zhentian.

Li Zhentian held the standard answer in one hand and the test paper in the other. His eyes were full of surprise and he almost could not believe his own eyes.

This was because the answers on this test paper were actually more than three points better than the standard answer.

“Moreover, the handwriting was so beautiful that it was beyond people’s reach. ”

It was said that every word looked like a person.

“Just by looking at the handwriting, one could tell that this must be a person full of experience! ”

It seemed that the new peak of the literary world was really coming!

Li Zhentian was so excited that both of his hands were trembling.

“Who is this ye Zhuo?”

“Wang Tao lowered his voice and said, “He is the last disciple that master Yu accepted not long ago.” ”

“Where is he?”Li Zhentian continued to ask.

“Wang Tao glanced at Master Yu’s seat, but did not see ye Zao. He swept his gaze and finally saw ye Zao in the back seat. He continued, “Do you see three little girls over there?” ”

Li Zhentian nodded.

“Wang Tao continued, “The little girl sitting in the middle is Miss Ye.” ”

“Is it the one wearing a white shirt?”Li Zhentian continued to ask.

“It’s her.”

“Li Zhentian narrowed his eyes. “No Wonder.”This young lady was not an ordinary person at first glance. Her temperament was like an orchid, elegant and noble. Originally, Li Zhentian was still curious about what kind of person would be able to get full marks. ”

“After seeing ye Zhuo, he did not find it strange anymore. ”

“Wang Tao continued, “Miss ye even handed in her paper two hours earlier.” ”

“Hearing this, Li Zhentian was stunned. He thought he was hearing things. ”

“After a while, he finally reacted and turned to look at Wang Tao. “What did you say just now?” ” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Wang Tao said, “Yes, you didn’t Mishear. Miss ye only spent an hour to finish all the questions.”Originally, Wang Tao was like the others. He thought that ye Zhuo was just an embroidered pillow, good-looking but useless. ”

“In addition, Ye Zao had handed in his paper two hours earlier, which made Wang Tao even more unconcerned. ”

Who would have thought.

It was this person who everyone looked down on that actually got full marks.

“If it wasn’t for seeing it with their own eyes, who would believe that an eighteen or nineteen-year-old girl would have such ability? ”

“As the highest-level leader in the literary world, Li Zhentian was also shocked at this time. He looked in the direction of ye Zao, unable to recover his senses for a long time. ”

“Ye Zao, an Lizi, and Zhao pingting were sitting behind Feng Qianxian and Old Lady Lin. ”

“When Li Zhentian looked over, it gave people the illusion that Li Zhentian was looking at Feng Qianxian. ”

Feng Qianxian was immediately stunned.

“But when she thought about how she had just gotten first place, she was not surprised. ”

She was first.

Who Would Li Zhentian look at if not her?

“Could it be that he was looking at that trash, Ye Zhuo? ”

“Ye Zhuo had handed in his papers two hours earlier, so most of the papers he handed in were blank. ”

Or it was a ghost drawing talisman.

“When Li Zhentian arrived at the scene, the contestants and the spectators were also very shocked. ”

Many people had never seen Li Zhentian before.

“Chief Li is looking over here! is the person who got a full score on our side?”

“That’s for sure!”

“Hearing this, everyone quickly looked left and right to see who was sitting here. ”

There were quite a few capable people sitting in this row.

“Could it be Zhou Miaoyan?”

“”I heard Zhou Miaoyan say that she didn’t do the last question, so it shouldn’t be her.” ”

“”If it’s not Zhou Miaoyan, then who is it? Could it be Zhao Tong?” ”

“Zhao Tong doesn’t sit here at all!”

“”F * ck! It Can’t Be Ye Zao, right?”Someone in the crowd said this. ”

The crowd immediately burst into laughter.

Ye Zao?

How could it be?

Ye Zao handed in his paper two hours in advance.

There were more than 260 questions in total.

“Even if she scribbled on the paper, it was impossible for her to finish all 260 questions. ”

“Therefore, it was impossible for it to be ye Zao. ”

“Could it be Miss Feng?”

“Miss Feng? Which Miss Feng?”

“”It’s that Miss Feng who wanted to become master Yu’s disciple in the beginning, but ye Zao beat her to it.” ”

“”Oh my God! If the person who got a perfect score was really miss feng, then wouldn’t there be a good show to watch?” ”

“Then master Yu will regret it to death!”
