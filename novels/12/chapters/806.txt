Translator: 549690339

“In the interrogation room, Feng Xianxian admitted to drugging Old Lady Lin. “Officer, I was also threatened! Grandma has raised me for 20 years. How can I be so heartless!” ”

The policeman looked up at Feng Xianxian. “Who threatened you?”

“Gao di! It was Gao di!”Feng Xianxian gave Gao di up. “The drug that caused Grandma’s stroke was also given by Gao Di!”

The main culprit and the accomplice were two completely different concepts.

“Moreover, she was threatened by someone. ”

“Moreover, this matter was originally Gao di’s idea. ”

“If Gao Di didn’t give her the two bottles of medicine, why would she drug Old Lady Lin? ”

In order to prevent such a day.

Feng Xianxian even left a recording of her conversation with Gao di on her phone.

“If anything happened to her, Gao Di wouldn’t be able to escape. ”

“Thinking of this, Feng Xianxian calmed down a little. ” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The police officer raised his head and gave his companion a look.

His companion immediately understood and walked out of the door.

“The police officer continued, “Tell me how Gao di threatened you.” ”

Feng Xianxian told him what she had already prepared.

At the same time.

Lin Manor.

“Ye Zhuo sat at his computer table, his ten fingers constantly jumping on the black keyboard. ”

“In a short while, she hacked into a certain surveillance screen. ”

She pressed the Delete key.

“After doing all this, Ye Zhuo closed the webpage and opened another webpage. After finding two audio clips, she also pressed the Delete key. ”

Done!

“After doing all this, Ye Zhuo sent a message to Wang Shuya. ”

“Gao Di was sitting opposite Wang Shuya, and his expression didn’t look good. ”

“Wang Shuya looked up at Gao Di and smiled. “Don’t worry, my goddess has already settled everything.” ”

“Really?”

“Wang Shuya nodded. “If it’s not true, you can push me out when the time comes.” ”

Wang Shuya had absolute trust in ye Zhuo.

“Hearing this, Gao di heaved a sigh of relief. ”

“At this moment, a servant came in with a policeman. “Miss Gao, these two policemen said that they came to look for you to understand something.” ”

“Seeing the police officers, Gao di stood up in surprise. “Officers, may I ask why you are looking for me?” ”

“May I trouble Miss Gao to have a private chat with us?”

Gao di nodded. “Of course. Let’s go to the study.”

“After saying that, Gao di turned to look at Wang Shuya and said apologetically, “Sister Ya, please excuse me for a moment.” ”

“You can go back to your work.”

Gao Di brought two policemen to the study room.

“When they arrived at the study room, the policemen went straight to the point. “May I ask where Miss Gao is on the afternoon of April 12th?” ”

“”April 12th?”Gao di frowned, “It’s already may 9th today. I can’t remember where I was on the afternoon of April 12th. If it was a rest day, I should have stayed at home or gone out for a stroll. If it was a work day, then I must be working at the unit.” ”

“Do you know Feng Xianxian?”

“Feng Xianxian?”Gao Di shook his head. “I don’t know her.”

“The police officer took out two medicine bottles, one white and one blue. “Does Miss Gao know these two things?” ”

“”No.”Gao di continued, “Officers, what exactly happened? Can you tell us?” ”

At the police station.

“After knowing that Gao di denied knowing her, Feng Xianxian was not surprised. After all, who would want to be involved in such a thing. ”

“Fortunately, she was prepared! ”

“Feng Xianxian continued, “I have a recording of my phone conversation with Gao Di!” ”

“Hearing this, the policewoman took out Feng Xianxian’s phone. “What’s the password?” ”

“698512.”

“The policewoman unlocked it and said, “Which folder does the recording belong to?” ”

“You can search for it directly.”

“The policewoman followed Feng Xianxian’s instructions and said, “I didn’t find it.” ”

“Feng Xianxian said, “Impossible! I clearly saved the recording!” ”

The policewoman handed the phone to Feng Xianxian.

“Feng Xianxian took the phone and searched for ten minutes, but she couldn’t find the recording on both ends. ”

“”How could this be? How could this be? I clearly recorded the recording.”In order to prevent the recording from being lost, Feng Xianxian even saved the recording into the cloud drive. ”

“But now, the cloud drive couldn’t find the recording either. ”

“The police continued, “Later, we will contact the technology department. They will check whether or not there is a recording in your phone. Other than recording, what other ways can you get famous? Do you know Gao Di?” ”

“”Surveillance! Every time we meet, we are under surveillance!” ”

“Which day’s surveillance? What is the specific time?”

“Feng Xianxian continued, “At 3 o’clock in the afternoon on April 12th, we met at the red street light 100 meters below the intersection of Huaihai Middle Road. There is a coffee shop opposite.” ”
