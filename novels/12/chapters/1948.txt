“In the darkness, Xu Yao narrowed her eyes. ”

Her eyes were filled with scheming expressions.

“He ziteng, who was sleeping at the side, did not expect that he had already walked into Xu Yao’s trap. ”

“In a moment, Xu Yao gently lifted the blanket, walked out of the door, and opened her phone. ”

“In the inbox, there was an unfamiliar text message. ”

“[ Yaoyao, long time no see. ] ”

“Although the person who came did not mention his name, Xu Yao suddenly thought of him. ”

Her eyes were slightly red.

“After a long while, Xu Yao slowly pressed the delete button. ”

“The next second, a new text message came in. ”

It was still an unfamiliar number.

“[ Yaoyao, I still love you. ] ”

“[ tomorrow at 3:30 p.m. , let’s meet at the coffee shop on the road. ] ”

“After browsing through it, Xu Yao pressed the delete button again. ”

“In the room, he ziteng was still sleeping soundly. ”

On the other side.

At the CEN residence.

Cen Shaoqing’s office.

“His assistant was standing by the side. “Master five, this is all the information I can find on Planet E-TY889.” ”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“The room was burning with sandalwood incense. Green smoke curled up, making his handsome face faintly visible. ”

“The assistant placed the documents on the desk and said, “Fifth master, if there’s nothing else, I’ll be leaving first.” ”

Cen Shaoqing slowly raised his hand.

The assistant left the office.

“In a moment, CEN Shaoqing picked up the documents on the desk. ”

He narrowed his eyes slightly.

“Half an hour later, Cen Shaoqing left the office and returned to the Cen family home. ”

“Old Madam Cen was waiting for Cen Shaoqing at the door. When she saw him return, she immediately went forward and greeted, “Shaoqing.” ”

“Grandma.”

Old Mrs. Cen wasn’t smiling as usual. “Quickly go and see your mother.”

Cen Shaoqing looked up at the electronic calendar on the wall.

It was the third day of the first month.

“On this day of the year, Zhou Xiang would either travel or sit in the bedroom without saying a word. ”

“This was because today was the anniversary of Cen Shaoqing’s father, Cen Haifeng’s death. ”

Zhou Xiang married Cen Haifeng at the age of 18.

“After five years of marriage, she had five children. ”

Cen Haifeng died unexpectedly when Cen Shaoqing was 16.

“Cen Shaoqing, who was only 16 years old, took the lead and gradually developed the CEN family into what it is now. ”

No one in China could compare.

“When Cen Haifeng died, Zhou Xiang was only 39 years old. ”

“Cen’s old lady was not the kind of unenlightened mother-in-law. The second year after Cen Haifeng’s death, she advised Zhou Xiang to marry another. ”

“After all, Zhou Xiang was still young. ”

She could not let her waste a lot of her youth in the CEN family.

But Zhou Xiang refused.

“Later, the Cen Old Lady proposed to take Zhou Xiang as a daughter and asked Zhou Xiang to recruit someone back. ”

But Zhou Xiang still refused.

“At that time, people in the circle were laughing at Zhou Xiang’s prudishness, and some people said that Zhou Xiang would not be able to keep it for long. ”

“Unexpectedly, Zhou Xiang kept it for 17 years. ”

“In these 17 years, Zhou Xiang had never done anything out of the ordinary, nor had she left any evidence for outsiders to use against her. ”

This was also the most important reason why old Mrs. Cen liked Zhou Xiang.

“Is my mother upstairs?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“Yes.”Old Mrs. Cen nodded slightly.

Cen Shaoqing turned around and walked upstairs.

“The door was open. From Afar, one could see Zhou Xiang sitting on the sofa, staring blankly at the photo on the coffee table. ”

The Man in the photo was young and handsome. The corners of his lips curled up slightly. It was the kind of man who could make a little girl scream when he walked out.

“”Mom,”Cen Shaoqing said faintly. ”

“Shaoqing.”Zhou Xiang raised her head to look at Cen Shaoqing.

“Her eyes were not red, and there were no traces of crying. However, people could see endless sadness from her body. ”

“Cen Shaoqing walked over and sat down. “Mom, you’re thinking of my dad again?” ”

“”Yes.”Zhou xiang nodded and continued, “I dreamed about him last night. He’s still the same as before, he hasn’t changed at all...” ”

“”A lot of times, I wonder if nothing happened to your dad. He was just joking around with us.” ”

Cen Haifeng died in a shipwreck.

“There were more than 1,300 people on the ship. All of them sank into the Atlantic Ocean. Even their bodies were not found. ”

“In the Cen family cemetery, there was only a cenotaph. ”

“In the years after Cen Haifeng’s death, Zhou Xiang often dreamed that Cen Haifeng was not dead at all. Cen Haifeng was just joking with her. ”

“In the dream, Zhou Xiang was ecstatic. She wanted to share the good news with everyone. ”

“Outside the door, Zhou Xiang was heartbroken. ”

“”Mom, Dad has been gone for 17 years.”Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted. “You should have let go of the past long ago.” ”

Let Go.

“Zhou Xiang raised her head to look out of the window and continued, “But why do I feel like all of this just happened yesterday?” ”

It had clearly been 17 years.

But she felt that it had only been for a moment.

“After saying that, Zhou Xiang continued, “Shaoqing, do you think that your father didn’t die? He was just taken away by aliens.” ”

“How could a large ship with more than 1,300 people not find any wreckage? ”

“However, the rescue team searched for more than three years in the vicinity of the accident, but they did not find anything. ”

“In the end, they could only give up on the search and rescue. ”

“All these years, Zhou Xiang had always thought that Cen Haifeng was fine, but she could not find any evidence. ”

“”Mom, don’t let your imagination run wild. Let bygones be bygones! Dad Is in heaven, and he doesn’t want to see you like this.” ”

Zhou Xiang sighed.

“After a while, she turned to Cen Shaoqing. “There’s one more thing that your grandmother and I haven’t told you.” ”

“What is it?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“”It’s about your four sisters,”Zhou Xiang said. ”

“Cen Shaoqing seemed to know what Zhou Xiang wanted to say. “Mom, you don’t have to say anything. They’re my biological sisters.” ”

“Although Zhou Xiang and old Mrs. Cen hadn’t said anything, Cen Shaoqing could tell that the four sisters weren’t Zhou Xiang and Cen Haifeng’s biological daughters. ”

Because the CEN family was not a family that valued sons over daughters!

“When Zhou Xiang gave birth to Cen Shaoqing, she was only 23 years old. It was impossible for her to give birth to four daughters before she was 23 years old. Most importantly, their ages did not match. ”

This was the CEN family’s biggest secret.

Cen Shaoqing’s four sisters were all the children of Cen Haifeng’s comrades.

This was also the reason why Zhou Xiang had secretly helped Cen Yuyan after she had done something wrong.

It was because they were all the daughters of Heroes.

“Zhou xiang continued, “No matter what happens, no matter when, Yuying, Yueya, Yuying, Yuyan, they are all your biological sisters.” ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“After a moment, Zhou Xiang stood up and said, “Alright Shaoqing, go do your work. I’m fine now.” ”

“Are you really fine?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“”I’m really fine.”Zhou xiang smiled and said, “It’s been so many years. What could have happened to me?” ” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Time could dilute everything.

The families that were in trouble back then had long returned to their normal lives.

Everything was peaceful.

“Seeing his mother like this, Cen Shaoqing did not say anything else and turned to leave. ”

“Seeing him come down, Old Mrs. Cen immediately went up to him and asked, “How’s Your Mother?” ”

“”You don’t have to worry. She’s fine,”Cen Shaoqing replied. ”

“That’s good.”Old Mrs. Cen nodded and heaved a sigh of relief.

“After saying that, old Mrs. Cen continued, “Your mother is a good mother and a good daughter-in-law. Unfortunately, your father’s life is short and he couldn’t let her enjoy her life.” ”

“When Cen Haifeng left, he left behind five children, all of whom were still in school. ”

“Zhou Xiang, 39, lost her husband overnight, her five children lost their father overnight, and old Mrs. Cen lost her son overnight. ”

“To outsiders, this might have been just an accident. ”

“But to them, it was a disaster. ”

“After Cen Haifeng left, many families who said the Cen family had good relations changed their minds faster than flipping a book. ”

“An orphan, a widowed mother, and an old lady. ”

“During that period of time, the Cen family’s life was not easy. ”

“Almost every day, people came to collect debts. ”

“During the most difficult period, the CEN old lady proposed to let Zhou Xiang remarry, but Zhou Xiang refused. ”

“At that time, the Cen Old Lady knew that this daughter-in-law was not married to the wrong person. ”

Fortunately.

“Fortunately, the only man in the family, Cen Shaoqing, was able to support himself at this time. ”

“After the Cen family’s life improved, the Cen Old Lady proposed to let Zhou Xiang recruit a man. She thought that Zhou Xiang would agree this time. After all, she was still young. ”

But Zhou Xiang still refused.

“All these years, the CEN old lady had always felt that the Cen family had let Zhou Xiang down. ”

“As a daughter-in-law, it was really not easy for Zhou Xiang to be able to be so inseparable. ”

“As for old Mrs. Cen, she had long treated Zhou Xiang as her own daughter. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “I heard that you have been investigating planet E-TY889 recently?” ”

Cen Shaoqing was stunned. “How did you know?”

“Old Mrs. Cen said, “Don’t worry about how I know. Let me tell you, that stupid planet has a lot of bullshit. Don’t investigate it if you can!” ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“”Where’s Yezi?”Old Mrs. Cen continued to ask, “Is she still coming today?” ”

“”She went to south city with uncle and aunt,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“To her second uncle’s Place?”Old Mrs. Cen asked.
