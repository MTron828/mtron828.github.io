Translator: 549690339

“In the blink of an eye, it was the next day. ”

Zhou cuihua brought the good wine from home and drove Li Hang to the Lin family.

Zhou Cuihua’s car was a BMW three series.

“Among ordinary people, it was considered a very good car. However, when she arrived at the villa area where the Lin family was located, she knew what a truly wealthy person was. ”

Only by witnessing this scene with her own eyes could she understand the shock within.

This was because the shopping and nanny cars here all started from bmws.

“Very quickly, they arrived halfway up the mountain. ”

“Looking at the large villa that occupied several thousand square meters in front of them, Zhou Cui Hua was immediately dumbfounded. “Hang Hang, is this really where Xia Xiaoman is staying now?” ”

“En.”Li hang nodded.

“Zhou Cui Hua parked the car in the parking spot. In a moment, the mother and daughter duo got out of the car. ”

The door of the villa was closed.

Li Hang went over to ring the doorbell.

“Soon, the maid came over to open the door. “Hello, May I know who you are looking for?” ”

“Li hang smiled and said, “I’m Lizi’s cousin, and this is my mother. We came here yesterday.” ”

“The maid sized up Zhou Cuihua and her daughter and then said, “What’s Your Name?” ”

“”My name is Li Hang, and my mother’s name is Zhou Cuihua,”Li hang replied. ”

The maid nodded. “I’ll go in to verify.”

“Alright.”

Zhou cuihua had never experienced such a thing before. She was completely stunned.

She did not expect that it would be so difficult to see Xia Xiaoman Now!

The uncomfortable feeling in her heart became more and more serious.

A moment later.

“The Maid returned and smiled as she opened the door. “Esteemed guests, please come in.” ”

“Li hang smiled and said, “Thank you.” ”

“”You’re welcome.”The servant guided the two of them into the house while saying, “Our wife is not at home today. Only Sir and young master are at home.” ”

“Is my cousin busy?”Li Hang asked.

The servant nodded. “Madam is indeed very busy these few days. Miss has gone to attend a class reunion.”

“I see.”Li hang nodded.

“After a while, he walked into the living room. ”

“Sure enough, only Lin Qingxuan was at home. ”

“Li Hang knew that Lin Qingxuan was not familiar with the mother and daughter, so he immediately took the initiative to go forward. “Hello, uncle. I’m Li Hang. This is my mother, Zhou Cuihua. is my aunt not at home today?” ”

“Lin Qingxuan roughly knew that Xia Xiaoman seemed to have such a relative. She smiled and said, “Yes, your aunt is busy outside. Take a seat quickly. Mother Wu, go and pour some tea.” ”

“”Yes, sir.” ”

Zhou Cuihua was a little stunned when she saw Lin Qingxuan.

“She had thought that the rich businessman that Xia Xiaoman had found would definitely be an old and ugly old man. She did not expect that this man was not only not ugly, but also quite handsome. ”

“Although he was already over forty years old, his facial features were still there. ”

“Coupled with the proper maintenance, it was not obvious at all that this was a man who was almost fifty years old. ”

It would be a lie to say that she was not jealous.

Who would have thought that Xia Xiaoman could marry so well after having a second marriage? FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“After a while, Zhou cuihua finally reacted, she smiled and said, “Cousin-in-law, Xiaoman and I are cousins. We grew up together and our relationship is especially good. “I was originally planning to visit Xiaoman yesterday, but I was delayed by something yesterday. I hope cousin-in-law will not take offense.” ”

“”You’re too kind, cousin-in-law,”Lin Qingxuan continued, “Sit down with the child. I’ve already asked someone to inform Xiaoman. She’ll be back soon.” ”

“Zhou Cuihua sat down with a smile. When she saw Lin Zhi on the sofa, she asked with a smile, “This must be little nephew, right? He’s so cute!” ”

“At the mention of Little Lin Zhi, Lin Qingxuan’s face was full of smiles. She picked up Lin Zhi and said, “Zhi, call me Auntie.” ”

Xiao Lin Zhi was very cold. He raised his chin and completely ignored Zhou cuihua.

“Lin Qingxuan said, “Ah Zhi, you can’t be so rude!” ”

“Zhou cuihua quickly said, “It’s fine, it’s fine. He’s just a child! Oh right, how old is my nephew this year?” ”

“”He’s almost three years old,”Lin Qingxuan replied. ”

“Just as they were talking, the sound of footsteps came from outside. ”

“Qingxuan!”

“Hearing the voice, Lin Qingxuan immediately stood up from the sofa. “It’s Xiaoman.” ”
