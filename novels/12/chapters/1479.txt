“After all, her rank was brought up by Ye Zao.”

She knew ye Zao’s skills too well!

“As expected, as soon as ye Zao went over, he took Red Daddy, who was opposite him, and also took a second kill.”

“Very soon, the system displayed the news of the other party being wiped out.”

“Zhao pingting said excitedly, “That old song’s skills are really good! Is He a man or a woman?””

“Ye Zao said while pushing the tower, “His name is song Shiyu. You’ve met him before.””

“As soon as he said that, the screen fell silent for a moment. Then, an excited voice was heard, “Ah Ah Ah! I remember now! It’s that handsome guy I met last time in Beijing, right? Oh My God, I didn’t expect such an elite to know how to play games!””

The corner of Song Shiyu’s mouth twitched when he was called handsome by others.

This friend of Ye Zao’s was quite active.

He didn’t look like ye Zao.

“Just as ye Zao was about to say something, Zhao pingting cried out, “Oh my God! Oh My God! Three people! How can I defeat them? ! Great Zao, come and Save My Dog Life!””

“Right away.”Ye Zao controlled his hero to come over.

“When ye Zao arrived, Zhao Pingting was only left with a sliver of HP.”

“Use Your Ultimate Skill!”Ye Zao was as calm as ever.

“Zhao Pingting quickly clicked on her ultimate skill, and ye Zao used a set of reaping skills.”

Triple Kill! Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Just then, Li Yuanfang, who was on the opposite side, passed by, and Ye Zao used a second skill.”

Fourth Kill!

“With another set of attacks, even Sun Wukong, who was on the side, was not spared.”

Fifth Kill!

“”F * ck! F * ck!”Zhao Pingting cried out in surprise, “Big Zao, your damage value is too high!””

“”That’s right.”Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Otherwise, why would everyone call me Dad?””

“Zhao pingting continued, “Sigh? Where’s Old Song? When did he die? I just said that he wasn’t a rookie, but I didn’t expect him to die so quickly! Looks like he’s still a rookie! I finally met someone who’s similar to me, and my mind is balanced!””

Song Shiyu rubbed his nose and didn’t say anything.

“Ye Zao felt that he should tactfully remind Zhao pingting that song Shiyu was right beside her. Otherwise, this child would say anything that would shock the world.”

“”Brother song, do you have any water?”Ye Zao looked back slightly.”

“Yes.”Song Shiyu opened the car refrigerator door with one hand and handed a bottle of water to ye Zao.

Ye Zao opened the bottle cap with one hand and drank a mouthful of water.

“At this moment, a cautious voice came from the other end of the screen. “That Big Zao.””

“Yes.”

“Zhao Pingting gulped. “That... old, oh no, Mr. Song is right beside you?””

“Yes.”

“”F * ck!”On the other end of the screen, Zhao Pingting was very embarrassed. Didn’t song Shiyu hear everything she said before? A moment later, Zhao pingting continued, “Dachaozhuo, are you wearing earphones?””

“At this moment, Zhao Pingting was praying in her heart.”

Wearing earphones.

She had to wear earphones.

“”No,”ye Zao continued, “We’re on our way to eat now.””

“Zhao pingting only wanted to slap herself to death. She did not notice that the enemy hero had already circled around from the other side, preparing to ambush her.”

“Ye Zao flashed over and instantly killed Daji. “Pingting, be careful.””

“Got it.”Zhao Pingting reacted at this moment.

“After learning that song Shiyu was here, Zhao Pingting did not speak carelessly. What she said the most was, “Big Zao, come quickly! Big Zao, save me!””

“As long as Ye Zao was here, she could rest assured and hug his thigh.”

“Ye Zao’s mind was completely focused on the game. A cool breeze blew in from outside the window, curling up his jet-black hair and dancing in the air.”

The soft hair brushed past song Shiyu’s chin.

It carried a faint fragrance of grass and trees.

It smelled very good.

It was also slightly itchy.

“After the game ended, Ye Zao looked up at his assistant in the front seat. “How much longer until we reach the restaurant?””

“His assistant replied, “About five minutes.””

“Ye zhuo nodded and continued, “Pingting, we’ll be at the restaurant soon. We won’t be playing anymore. Go to bed early.””

“”Okay.”Zhao pingting continued, “Great Burning, aren’t you in China Right Now?””

“”Yes, I’m in C country.””

“Hearing that ye Zhuo was in C country, Zhao pingting continued, “Great Burning, can you help me buy a face cream? My Sister-in-law’s birthday is coming up soon. I want to buy it as a birthday present for her.””

“”Sure, just send it to my wechat.””

“”Okay, I’ll send it later.””

“After turning off the game, ye Zao realized that her hair was blown to song Shiyu’s side. She immediately tied her hair up with a rubber band. “Sorry!””
