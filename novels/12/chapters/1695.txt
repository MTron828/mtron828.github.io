“Hearing this, mother Zou frowned. ”

There was indeed a person called Lin Jinshui who borrowed money from their family. The reason why mother Zou remembered it clearly was because Lin Jinshui was quite a business-minded person.

“Mother zou continued, “Feifei, don’t worry. Mother will definitely get justice for you!” ”

The Zou family had been in business for so many years and had accumulated a lot of power. It was simply a waste of water if they wanted to settle this matter!

“Regardless of whether Zou Feifei had done this or not, the Zou family could easily get her out! ”

“If they dared to let her daughter suffer this kind of injustice, she saw that the two young girls didn’t want to live anymore. ”

“”Mom! You must not let those two B * tches, Ye Zhuo and Lin Shasha off!” ”

“Zou nodded and stood up, holding Zou Feifei’s hand. “Let’s go. You Go home with Mom First!” ”

Zou Feifei was overjoyed when she heard that Zou wanted to take her home.

“At this moment, a policeman came out and stopped Zou. “Stop! You can leave! The suspect can’t Leave!” ”

“Suspect? Who are you calling a suspect!”Zou scolded loudly.

“Zou Feifei is a suspect!”

“Mother Zou said angrily, “You said my daughter is a suspect! Do you know who I am? What is my relationship with your superior, director Wu?” ”

“”No matter what the relationship is, you can’t take Zou Feifei away today!” ”

Mother Zou was angry. “Wait! You just wait!”

“After saying that, mother Zou turned back to look at Zou feifei and said gently, “Feifei, let’s make do here for the night. Mom will come and pick you up tomorrow.” ”

“Zou Feifei said with red eyes, “Mom, then you have to come and pick me up!” ”

“Don’t worry.”

“After saying that, mother Zou turned around and walked out. Before she left, she even glared at the police officer who stopped her. ”

You Blind Dog!

Just you wait!

“Tomorrow, I’ll make him regret it. ”

...

The next day.

Mother Zou swaggered into the police station with a smug look on her face.

“The director on the side nodded and bowed. “Mrs. Zou, I’m really sorry. It’s our fault. Your daughter has been wronged.” ”

“How could he have thought that not only did he catch the wrong person, but he also brought back a lot of trouble. ”

“Mother Zou snorted. “Where’s My Daughter? If we delay her college entrance exam today, I’ll make you pay!” ”

“”Mom!”At this moment, Zou Feifei ran out and hugged mother Zou. “You’re finally here!” ”

“Seeing zou feifei like this, Zou’s mother’s heart ached. “Feifei, are you okay?” ”

“”Mom, you must avenge me!”Zou feifei cried. ”

“”Don’t worry.”Zou’s mother patted Zou Feifei’s back, “Lin Sha and Ye Zhuo, those two wild girls, slandered and slandered you. Mom will definitely not let them go! Mom has already told your godfather. Your Godfather will definitely help you vent your anger.” ”

“Slandering others and causing them to be hurt was not a small matter. With Wu’s methods, he would definitely let Ye Zao and Lin Shasha stay in prison for a few years. ”

“At this moment, a police car stopped outside the door. ” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Three people got out of the police car.

“A slender figure walked in front, and the other two were police officers in uniform. ”

“Seeing ye Zao being escorted in by the police officers, Zou Feifei curled her lips. ”

“”Mom, wait a minute, I’ll go talk to her.” ”

“Go ahead.”Zou’s mother nodded.

“Zou Feifei walked to ye Zao’s side and sneered, “Do you think you’re qualified to fight with me? Do you know who my godfather is?” ”

Ye Zao’s expression was indifferent. “Who is it?”

“Zou Feifei leaned close to ye Zao’s ear and whispered, “Wu Jia Guo.” ”

Ye Zao slightly raised his lips. “The name is not bad.”

“What do you mean?”Zou feifei slightly frowned.

“The literal meaning.”

“Zou Feifei coldly snorted. “Ye Zao, you’re already at the end of your life, so why are you still pretending! Be careful or I’ll make sure you never come out!” ”

“After saying this, Zou feifei arrogantly left. ”

Ye Zao was brought into the interrogation room.

“What’s Your Name?”

“056189.”Ye Zao reported a string of numbers.

“”I asked you what your name is?”Tao Lin, who was in charge of the interrogation, was a little impatient. ”

“”Input the string of numbers that I just reported,”ye Zao said. ”
