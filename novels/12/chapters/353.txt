“Burning burning.”Old Madam Song turned to look at the door.

“Actually, she could no longer see. She just turned her head subconsciously. ”

Ye Zhuo walked over and sat by the bed. He stretched out his hand and placed it on old madam song’s pulse.

Her pulse was extremely weak.

It was obvious that she had reached her limit.

Ye Zhuo looked at song Shiyu and shook his head slightly.

“Song Shiyu’s expression was the same as usual. There was not much of an expression on his face. “Grandma, rest in peace and recuperate. Ye Zhuo is already here. Her medical skills are very good. You will definitely be fine.” ”

“Old Madam song smiled and said, “I know my own body very well. These few days, I have been dreaming about your grandfather, your father, and your mother. They said that they would come and pick me up today.” ”

It was unknown which of old Madam Song’s words had angered song Shiyu.

Song Shiyu’s expression instantly became extremely gloomy.

“Two streams of turbid tears flowed out of old Madam Song’s eyes. “Shiyu, it’s already been 12 years. Haven’t you forgiven your father yet...” ”

Father?

Was that kind of scum really worthy of being a father?

“Song Shiyu did not speak, but his eyes were filled with restraint. ”

Ten years ago.

He had been diagnosed by a doctor with unstable personality disorder.

Hold it in.

He had to hold it in.

He did not want her to see such an unbearable version of himself.

“Song Shiyu’s hands were clenched into fists, trying to control his emotions. ”

“Old Madam song sighed and said weakly, “You go out first. I want to have a private chat with searing.” ”

Song Shiyu stood where he was and did not move.

He knew what Old Madam Song wanted to say.

Old Madam song sighed again.

“The person she had let down the most in her life was song Shiyu, and the person she was most worried about was also song Shiyu. ”

This child had suffered too much.

“After so many years, she had never seen anyone who could walk into song Shiyu’s heart. ”

She knew that ye searing was a different existence to song Shiyu.

After many investigations.

Only then did old madam song know that Ye Zao was the little girl from back then.

Old Madam song was ecstatic when she heard this answer.

She knew that only ye Zao could warm the rest of Song Shiyu’s life.

She originally wanted to tell ye Zao everything before she died and entrust song Shiyu to Ye Zao.

Unfortunately...

Was she really going to leave with regrets?

“Old Madam song held ye Zao’s hand, she continued, “Zao Zao, I’m Shiyu’s only relative in this world. After I leave, he’ll be the only one left in this world. This child has been afraid of the dark and loneliness since he was young. If you have time, can you come and visit him often on behalf of Grandma?” ”

“Ye Zao nodded. “Alright, don’t worry.” ”

“”Zao, take care of the child. Thank you.” ”

“After saying that, old madam song turned to look in song Shiyu’s direction. She extended her other hand towards song Shiyu. “Shiyu, Shiyu.” ”

“I’m here.”

Song Shiyu walked over and held old madam song’s hand.

“”Grandma can’t take it anymore. Grandma is about to leave...”. “...”. Old Madam song continued, “As the saying goes, when a man is about to die, his words should be kind. Shiyu, let bygones be bygones! “Your father and stepmother have been gone for so many years. Promise Grandma that you’ll let go of those bygones and live a good life in the future, Okay?” ”

Song Shiyu didn’t say anything. No emotions could be seen in his lowered eyes.

Ye Zhuo raised his eyes and looked at song Shiyu.

“”Can’t you promise Grandma That You’ll let her go in Peace?”At this point, Old Madam song couldn’t help but cough. ”

“Only then did song shiyu slowly say, “I’m sorry, I can’t be perfunctory with you.” ”

“Old Madam song closed her eyes, and muddy tears rolled down her cheeks. ”

“After a long while, old madam song continued to speak. ”

“”Shi, Shi Yu, Grandma hopes that your life will be smooth and that you’ll be able to walk out of the past as soon as possible...”when she said this.., old Madam Song suddenly opened her eyes and turned to look at the door. A smile blossomed on the corner of her mouth. “Old Man, Old Man, you’ve come to pick me up...” ”

Ye Zao turned his eyes slightly.

There was no one there.

He looked at Old Madam song again. The old woman had closed her eyes forever.

“A living life had disappeared right in front of his eyes. Ye Zao could not help but cry out with red eyes, “Grandma Song!” ”

Song Shiyu handed ye Zao a clean handkerchief.

Ye Zao looked up at him.

Song Shiyu’s eyes remained unchanged. “Do you think I’m too cold-blooded?”

His biological grandmother had passed away in front of him.

But his tears had yet to fall.

“In her heart, he must be a cold-blooded devil, right? ”

“Ye Zhuo took the handkerchief. “Don’t try to persuade others to be kind without going through their hardships.”No one knew what song Shiyu had experienced, so no one was qualified to judge song Shiyu. ”

Song Shiyu was stunned.

No one had ever said this to him before.

The most common saying he had heard was: “All parents are alike.”.

“Everyone said that he was cruel and merciless, and that he had committed such a heinous act as murdering his father. ”

But who knew the reason behind his father’s murder?

No one had ever asked.

“Song Shiyu turned to look at sister Hong. “Sister Hong, Old Madam has already left. You can make the arrangements for the funeral.” ”

Sister Hong wiped her tears. “Alright.”

...

At the same time.

Country P.

It was one o’clock in the morning in country P.

A Rolls-royce drove past the luxurious streets.

In the back seat of the car sat a man with cold facial features. He was holding a Buddhist bead in his hand as he leaned against the back of the chair and squinted at the roadside.

This person was none other than Cen Shaoqing.

It was Cen Shaoqing.

“Although country P had indeed been rather chaotic these past few days, this sort of chaos did not affect Cen Shaoqing in the slightest. ”

“Those crazy people who killed, killed, and looted had to retreat when they saw the license plate number of CEN Shaoqing’s car. ”

“At this moment, Cen Shaoqing suddenly saw four or five people from country P ganging up on a Chinese man. ”

The car was very fast.

“Cen Shaoqing only took a quick glance and suddenly said, “Stop the car!” ”

The driver hurriedly stopped the car.

A few bodyguards immediately got out of the car and shouted into the air.

The five maniacs were so scared that they ran in all directions.

“A man was lying on the ground. His white shirt was dyed red with blood, and the documents in his briefcase were scattered all over the ground. ”

Cen Shaoqing did not expect to meet ye Sen here. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

He also did not expect to accidentally save ye Sen.

“In this way, could it resolve ye Sen’s hostility toward him? ”

“”Mr. Ye, are you okay?” ”
