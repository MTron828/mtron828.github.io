“At this point, old Mrs. Cen paused and continued, “Oh right, Yezi, is it a boy or a girl?””

“Ye Zhuo was about to say that he didn’t know, but Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips parted slightly. “It’s a boy.””

“”Then let’s call it ‘Big Beauty’! What do you think, searing?”Old Mrs. Cen looked at Ye Zhuo.”

Name a boy great beauty?

Ordinary people really couldn’t keep up with old Mrs. Cen’s Way of thinking.

“Ye Zha smiled and said, “It’s pretty good.”” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Then my great-grandson will be called great beauty from now on!”Old Mrs. Cen continued.

“Yes.”Ye Zha nodded slightly.

“Great beauty seemed to be very satisfied with the name old Mrs. Cen gave it. She barked at the crystal lamp, “Woof!””

Old Mrs. Cen happily hugged big beauty. “Grandma’s Great Great-grandson is really great!”

“After saying that, old Mrs. Cen seemed to have thought of something. “Yezi, has our big beauty applied for an identity card?””

“No.”Ye Zhuo frowned slightly.

“Hearing that, Old Mrs. Cen hurriedly got someone to call for the butler.”

“The Butler immediately came over. “Old Mrs. Cen, what are your orders?””

“Old Madam Cen looked at the housekeeper and said, “Take big beauty to get a vaccination and get an identity card while you’re at it. Get a beauty treatment and make my great-grandson look beautiful. I’ll take him on a blind date tomorrow.””

Big Beauty?

Great-grandson?

The housekeeper was stunned. When did old madam Cen have a great-grandson?

Was he hallucinating?

Could it be that ye Zhuo had a child with Cen Shaoqing?

Why didn’t he know?

“”What are you still standing there for?”Old Mrs. Cen said, “Hurry up and take Big Beauty With You!””

“”Where is the little, Little Young Master?”The Butler asked.”

“”Yes, isn’t he?”Old Mrs. Cen patted big beautiful’s head.”

“Woof!”

The Butler was stunned. How could he have thought that the great great grandson that old Mrs. Cen mentioned was actually a dog...

“”Okay, I’ll go now.”The housekeeper finally reacted and took the dog leash from old Mrs. Cen.”

“Old Mrs. Cen instructed, “Oh right, remember to buy some snacks and toys for my great-great-grandson at the pet shop. Everything will be done according to the highest standards. His great-grandmother lacks everything except money. “This child’s self-confidence must be nurtured from a young age. I can’t let other dogs look down on my great-great-grandson.””

“”Okay, Old Lady.”The butler nodded and left with big beauty.”

“Seeing that it was getting late, Old Lady Cen stood up from the sofa. “Yezi, what do you want to eat for lunch? Grandma will show you something!””

Old Lady Cen had been paying attention to the health channel recently. The experts on the channel said that an old lady cooking more would be beneficial to prolonging her life.

“Old Lady Cen was originally a very Buddhist person. Life and death were determined by fate, and wealth and honor were determined by heaven. She felt that the words of the health care experts were nonsense!”

So what if she died!

“In this world, who could escape this hurdle?”

“But it was different now. Cen Shaoqing had just found a girlfriend, so she couldn’t leave so early. She had to personally see Cen Shaoqing and ye Zhuo enter the marriage hall.”

She also had to personally witness her great-grandson!

“So, she absolutely couldn’t die early!”

“I’ll go with you.”Ye Zhuo stood up from the sofa.

Cen Shaoqing rolled up his sleeves. “Both of you don’t have to go. Let me do it.”

“One was his grandmother, and the other was his leader. No matter which one it was, he could not afford to offend them.”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Grandmother Cen, why don’t you not go into the kitchen? Let Cen Shaoqing and I do it.””

“”No, I want to Go! Yezi, you haven’t eaten my cooking, right?”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “I have Xiao Zhang and Xiao Li to help me in the kitchen. The two of you don’t have to cause any trouble for me!””

“Since old Mrs. Cen had said so, the two of them didn’t follow her to the kitchen.”

“Soon, a fragrant smell came from the kitchen.”

“Ten minutes later, Old Mrs. Cen came over with a piece of potato chip. “Shaoqing, quickly help me taste this piece of potato chip. Is it wet, salty, or Bland?””

“Cen Shaoqing took the potato chip, tasted it, and then said, “It’s not bad. Grandma, please take a piece and give it to searing.””

“”Give it another ten minutes,”said old Mrs. Cen.”

“Why?”Cen Shaoqing was a little confused.

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “There are only two sprouted potatoes left in the house. I read that sprouted potatoes are poisonous and can not be eaten, so you should first try to see if they will be poisoned to death. If you are fine, you can give them to searing.””

Cen Shaoqing:”...”even a non-biological grandmother would not do such a thing.

“Ye Zhuo, who was beside him, laughed lightly.”

Cen Shaoqing subconsciously wanted to throw up the potatoes.

“”Don’t throw up, don’t throw up.”Old Mrs. Cen immediately stopped Cen Shaoqing, then she said, “Not every potato that sprouts is poisonous. What if yours isn’t! “There’s only one potato in the house. It’s too late to buy it now! “Moreover, if it’s really poisonous, there’s nothing to be afraid of. With a burning flame by your side, can it still poison you to death?””
