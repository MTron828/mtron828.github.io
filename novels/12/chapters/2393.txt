Chapter 2394: 501: Self-humiliation! 4

Translator: 549690339

YC had created the first aircraft carrier and created an oasis on Mars. It was now an existence that no one could surpass.

China had once become the number one technological power.

“If they wanted to surpass China, they had to create a legend in the scientific research community that would make everyone’s eyes shine. ”

L continent had been silent for a very long time.

“This time, they would definitely be able to raise their heads in front of the entire world. ”

“”Then what do you mean?”The assistant looked at Mario, unable to guess what he was thinking. ”

He did not know how to deal with the rest of the matter.

“Mario continued, “Continue with the experiment. Don’t bother about those people.” ”

“Hearing this, the assistant hesitated, he continued, “It was professor Zhang who personally contacted us. He said that this single-celled organism is extremely terrifying. In just three days, it has evolved into a multi-celled organism. If we don’t dispose of it in time, it will be a disaster.” ”

“This was an unknown extraterrestrial organism. Furthermore, this was an earth that was rich in resources. If what Professor Zhang Said was true, then wouldn’t the people who participated in the experiment be finished? ”

“Scaremongering!”Mario laughed out loud. “Did YC really think that I would believe such nonsense?”

“From Mario’s point of view, ye Zao had made up such a ridiculous story because he wanted to keep these precious resources for himself. ”

Did he really think that she was a three-year-old child?

That she was so gullible?

“The assistant continued, “But Dr. Zhang Said...” ”

“Hearing this, Mario’s expression instantly changed. He raised his head to look at the assistant. “You don’t have to come over tomorrow.” ”

This sudden sentence caused the assistant to be dumbfounded.

“”Mr. Mario, I...” ”

“Just as the assistant was about to explain, Mario continued, “I don’t need a traitor here!” ”

Mario had always been like this.

Suspicious.

Unable to listen to his persuasion.

“Especially now that he felt that he had found a way to surpass China, how could he be willing to give up? ”

“The assistant clearly knew Mario’s character and continued, “Yes, sir.” ”

“After saying that, he turned around and left. ”

“Looking at the back of his assistant, Mario picked up the phone on his desk and made a call. ”

“Very quickly, the call was connected. ”

“Mario continued, “Keep an eye on Guinevere.” ”

“Yes.”A respectful voice came from the other end.

“Mario did not accept the opinions of the Chinese, causing a huge sensation in the laboratory. ”

“After all, Ye Zao’s status in the scientific research world was not something that an ordinary person could compare to. ”

“Furthermore, the phrase ‘disaster’was not something that could be casually said. ”

“Since ye Zao had said so, there must be a reason behind it. ”

“At that moment, the higher-ups of the laboratory were split into two factions. ” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“One was in support of ye Zao, while the other was in support of Mario. ”

Mario arrived at the scene.

“Immediately, a doyen walked over to Mario’s side, with an excited expression, he said, “Mr. Mario, I think what Dr. YC said makes sense. These extraterrestrial creatures are already unknown. Now that they have evolved so quickly, if they are allowed to develop, the situation will definitely become serious!” ”

Mario’s face was filled with disdain.

“The elder continued, “Mr. Mario, please hurry up with this experiment! Don’t do anything that you will regret!” ”

“Of course, there were also those who objected, “I don’t think so! After all, YC belongs to China. What if she wants to keep it for herself?” ”

“After all, the L continent had also sent a sample to ye Zao. ”

“Fortunately, Mario had a trick up his sleeve. He had sent everything to Ye Zao. ”

“Therefore, even if it was ye Zao ”

“That won’t happen! Doctor YC isn’t that kind of person!”

“Although kading had not had much contact with ye Zao before this, through two experiments that had shocked the entire world, Kading was able to tell that ye Zao wasn’t that kind of person who schemed against others. ”

She did not even bother to do so.

“Mario turned his head, his expression a little strange. “That means you know a lot about YC?” ”

“”Mr. Mario, it’s not a question of whether we understand or not!”Keating continued, “It’s what Dr. YC said that makes sense! “While we can still destroy these cells, hurry up and destroy them. You have to know that we simply can not afford to take this risk!” ”

L continent was just a small island.

It was surrounded by the sea.

“If anything really went wrong with the experiment, it would be an irreparable situation! ”

“Therefore, they had to nip the danger in the bud from the very beginning. ”

“Mario continued, “Keating, what do you mean by this?” ”
