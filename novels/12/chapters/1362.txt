Chapter 1363: Xie wanqiu’s face turned pale

Translator: 549690339

He had never married before.

He would never marry in his life.

“In the past, old Mrs. Cen had even committed suicide to force Cen Shaoqing into marriage. ”

Old Mrs. Cen must have used the same trick again this time.

Disgusting.

It was simply disgusting!

She actually threatened Cen Shaoqing with her own life.

“Old Mrs. Cen was Cen Shaoqing’s grandmother. Just like him, they were both Cen Shaoqing’s elders. Therefore, no matter what old Mrs. Cen did, he could not say anything. ”

Zhou Xiang was the one who made Zhou Zuolong feel a chill in his heart.

“Zhou Xiang was his biological daughter. As his biological daughter, Zhou Xiang actually did not help him. Instead, she stood on old Mrs. Cen’s side. ”

How could there be a daughter like Zhou Xiang in the world!

“Zhou Xiang was already like this to his biological father, let alone Xie wanqiu. ”

“Thinking of this, Zhou Zuolong’s heart ached for Xie Wanqiu. ”

“It was not easy to be a stepmother. Moreover, Xie Wanqiu had been a stepmother for so many years. ”

“At this moment, his phone rang in the air. ”

Zhou Zuolong picked up his phone.

It was a call from Xie wanqiu.

“Seeing Xie Wanqiu’s call, Zhou Zuolong’s expression eased up a little. He walked to the side and lowered his voice to pick up the phone. “Hello, wanqiu.” ”

“Xie Wanqiu’s voice came from the other side, “Old Man, where are you now? Did you go to Xiang Xiang’s house? I asked yinyin, but she refused to tell me no matter what.” ”

“Zhou zuolong smiled and said, “I’m just out for a walk. I’ll be back soon. Don’t worry.” ”

“”Old Man, we’ve lived together for so many years. Don’t I know who you are?”Xie wanqiu continued, “You must be at Xiang Xiang’s house now, right?” ”

“In order to not make Xie wanqiu worry, Zhou zuolong still said, “No.” ”

“”Do you think you can still deceive me?”Xie wanqiu smiled and said, “Old man, the relationship between this stepmother and stepdaughter is quite delicate. There is even a saying in the market that the heart of a stepmother is the tail of a wasp. It doesn’t matter what others say about me. I just need to have a clear conscience.” ”

“At this point, Xie wanqiu paused, then, she said, “Old man, you must not make things difficult for Xiang Xiang. Some words are enough. You must not make Xiang Xiang angry. Ying ‘er left early. Xiang is my only daughter now...” ”

“At the end of her sentence, Xie Wanqiu cried out loud. ”

“Hearing Xie Wanqiu’s crying, Zhou Zuolong was extremely anxious. “WANQIU, don’t cry. Don’t worry. I will definitely not make things difficult for Xiang Xiang. I am Xiang Xiang’s biological father. Will this biological father make things difficult for his own daughter?” ”

“Xie wanqiu continued, “Old man, you’ve always been a man of your word. With your words, I’ll be at ease.” ”

“”Mm, take good care of your body and cooperate with the doctor. You’re thinking more than you think. I’ll be back to accompany you soon.” ”

“”Don’t worry.”Saying this, Xie wanqiu sighed, then, she continued, “As parents, they’re most afraid of seeing their children suffer and be deceived. The onlooker sees clearly, but the person in the middle is confused. Xiangxiang is now the person in the middle. “Xiang Xiang listens to you the most. You must make Xiang Xiang wake up. You must not let Xiang Xiang be deceived by ye Zao. Xiang Xiang is a heartless child. These days, even in my dreams, I am worried about that silly girl... “Ying ‘ER has already left. If anything happens to Xiang Xiang, then as a mother, I will have no face to live in this world!” ”

Who Was Ying ‘er?

“Ying ‘er was Xie Wanqiu’s biological daughter, Xie Ying. ”

“When Xie Wanqiu mentioned Xie Ying again, the tears that had already stopped started to surge again. ”

“”She was only thirty-five years old when she left. She didn’t even look at yinyin... My Poor Ying ‘er! Her life is so miserable!”Xie wanqiu almost burst into tears, “I really don’t want to experience that kind of pain a second time. Old Man, I’ll Leave Our Xiangxiang to you.” ”

“Xie Wanqiu wasn’t the only one who was in pain. Zhou Zuolong was also in pain. Although he hadn’t spent much time with Xie Ying, they were still father and daughter after all. ”

Zhou Zuolong also treated Xie Ying as his own daughter.

“Xie Ying herself was also very outstanding. Zheng wanying was like Xie Ying, a talented girl who was both talented and beautiful. ”

It was a pity.

The heavens were jealous of a beauty. Xie Ying had gone too early.

“Speaking of which, the reason for Xie Ying’s death was generally due to Zhou Xiang. ”

“That year, he and Xie wanqiu were prepared to introduce Xie Ying to Cen Haifeng. ” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

It was unknown what tricks Zhou Xiang used to make Cen Haifeng have no choice but to marry her.

“In order to let Xie Ying marry Cen Haifeng smoothly, he and Xie wanqiu even thought of a substitute marriage. ”
