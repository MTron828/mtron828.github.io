“When Father Zhao, who was kneeling on the ground, heard this, his eyes lit up. ”

He knew that ye Zhuo was indeed capable.

“Otherwise, he would not have healed Han Dongliang. ”

It was fine.

Ye Sen would be fine.

“At this moment, the sound of hurried footsteps came from the silent corridor. ”

Father Zhao turned around and saw a slender figure.

Ye Zao!

It was ye Zao!

Ye Zao had finally arrived! Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Father Zhao had never been so excited before.

“Ye Zao jogged all the way. “Father, mother, grandmother, how is Uncle Now?” ”

“Ye Shu said, “The Doctor said that your uncle only has less than seventy-two hours left. He wants us to quickly prepare for his funeral. Zao Zao, please save your uncle!” ”

“Hearing this, Ye Zhuozhuo frowned slightly. ”

“Although she felt that Lin Jincheng’s voice was not quite right on the phone, she still did not expect Ye Sen’s situation to be so serious. ”

“Father Zhao immediately said, “Miss Ye! Chief Ye! Please save my son! What happened before was all Xue Yin’s fault. I’ll apologize on her behalf! As long as you can save my son, we, father and daughter, will be your slaves from now on!” ”

Father Zhao had been a hypocrite all his life.

“But now, he was not a hypocrite. ”

“As long as ye Zao Could Cure Ye Sen, he was willing to do anything for ye Zao. ”

Ye Zao was stunned for a moment. He even thought that he was hallucinating.

This was Zhao Zhenfei?

Then how did ye Sen become Zhao Zhenfei’s son?

“Seeing ye Zao like this, ye Shu explained, “He is your uncle’s biological father.” ”

“Although ye Shu did not want to admit it, it was the truth, and she had no choice but to admit it. ”

“Blood Type AB was very rare. Without a direct blood relationship, it was impossible for the two of them to be of the same blood type. ”

Ye Zhuo frowned slightly.

Zhao Zhenfei was ye Sen’s biological father?

“Zhao Zhenfei had not come to acknowledge ye Sen for a long time, but he had come at the time of Ye Sen’s accident. She really did not believe that this matter had nothing to do with Zhao Zhenfei. ”

“However, the anxiety and sadness in Zhao Zhenfei’s eyes did not seem to be acting. ”

Ye Zao even saw a trace of regret in Zhao Zhenfei’s eyes.

“However, now was not the time to think about this. Saving people was more important. ”

“”Mom, let’s go and see Uncle First.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Shu nodded.

“Although Father Zhao also wanted to go in with her, IC could only let two people in at a time, so he could only lean against the window and watch. ”

“Wearing a special isolation suit, ye Zao walked into the ward. ”

“Ye Sen just lay on the bed, his face pale. ”

“Seeing ye Sen like this, Ye Shu’s eyes immediately turned red. “Ye Sen, Zao and I came to see you! Don’t you like your niece the most? Open your eyes and see if she’s okay.” ”

Ye Sen didn’t respond.

“Ye Zao put his hand on Ye Sen’s pulse and listened attentively. In a moment, he released his wrist and turned to ye Shu. “Mom, let’s go out first.” ”

“Ye Shu wiped her tears. “Yes, is your uncle okay?” ”

“Let’s talk outside.”

Ye Shu nodded and followed ye Zao outside.

“Just as the two of them came out, Lin Jincheng, ye Langhua, and Father Zhao, who were waiting outside, surrounded them and asked about ye Sen’s situation. ”

“Ye Zao said, “The situation is indeed quite troublesome. Uncle has been infected with a rare virus, and there’s only one way to save him now.” ”

“Hearing the word ‘save’, father Zhao’s eyes lit up. ”

That’s great!

That’s really great!

“After saying that, ye Zao continued, “But I’m only 10% sure.” ”
