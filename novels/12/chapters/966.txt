“”That’s right, it’s 80 million.” ”

Brother Tao gulped. “What do you want 80 million for?”

“Song Chenyu continued, “It’s not for me, it’s for them. Their goal is to get 80 million.” ”

“Your parents?”Brother Tao asked.

Song Chenyu nodded.

“Brother Tao frowned and said, “If it’s 8 million, I can still think of a way for you. 80 million...”if it wasn’t a top-tier wealthy family, who could easily take out 80 million? ”

“Song Chenyu’s face was full of worry, but she didn’t say anything. ”

“Brother Tao continued, “Why don’t you look for someone else? By the way, I heard from director Feng that you’re quite familiar with song Shi Group’s CEO Song. Why Don’t you go ask him to help you?” ”

Song Shi Group was also the father of the investor of Song Chenyu’s entertainment company.

“If song Shiyu made a move, this crisis could be resolved. ”

“Hearing this, song Chenyu’s eyes lit up. ”

That’s right.

She could go look for song Shiyu.

“She was now song Shiyu’s only family in this world, and song Shiyu doted on her so much that he even moved song Shi Group’s headquarters to Beijing for her. As long as she asked, Song Shiyu would definitely help her! ”

“With song Shiyu’s protective personality, not only would he give her 80 million yuan, he would also help her deal with the Zhou family. ” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Thinking that she could completely get rid of the Zhou family in the future, song Chenyu heaved a sigh of relief and turned to look at brother Tao. “I’m going to the Song Corporation Now!” ”

“Brother Tao said in surprise, “You really know CEO song?” ”

Song Chenyu nodded. “Song Shiyu is my brother.”

Song Shiyu is song Chenyu’s brother?

“Hearing this, brother Tao’s face was full of disbelief, but he also somewhat understood why song Chenyu’s star path had been so smooth all these years. ”

So it was because of the father of the investor!

“”Chenyu, are you kidding me?”Brother Tao continued to ask. ”

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “I’m not kidding. Song Shiyu is my brother.” ”

“”Great! Then hurry up and go find your brother!”After saying that, brother Tao frowned in confusion. “If song Shiyu is your brother, then what’s going on with your parents?” ”

“Song Chenyu said, “This matter can’t be explained in a short time. I’ll go find my brother First!” ”

“”Hurry up and Go!”Brother Tao nodded and continued, “You’d better settle all these matters within three days. So far, there are already ten companies that want to cancel their endorsements with you.” ”

“Not only had the endorsements been canceled, but Song Chenyu’s two big female lead dramas had also been replaced. ”

“The current situation was very serious for song Chenyu. If it was not resolved quickly, not only would song Chenyu be blackened by the entire Internet, but her career would also end here! ”

“Song Chenyu nodded. “I know. Don’t worry. With My Brother’s help, it won’t take more than three days for this matter to calm down.” ”

“Brother Tao smiled and said, “Then I’ll wait for Your Good News.” ”

At the same time.

Song Corporation.

Song Shiyu was sitting in his boss’s chair behind his desk. His legs were crossed as he listened to the department manager’s report.

The Department Manager was reporting his work while secretly observing song Shiyu’s expression. His forehead was covered in layers of cold sweat.

“Although song Shiyu did not say anything, he could not help but feel nervous. ”

“Song Shiyu was an eccentric person. He was calm a second ago, but in the next second, he would become extremely agitated. ”

Even a 1.8-meter-tall Brawny man had been scared to tears by song Shiyu.

He didn’t want to be scared to tears by song Shiyu.

“At this moment, there was a knock on the door. ”

The department manager heaved a sigh of relief.

Heavenly Bodhisattva!

Someone had finally come to save him.

“”Come in,”song Shiyu said slowly, then turned to look at the department manager. “You can go back first.” ”

“The department manager bowed and turned to leave. Just then, he brushed past Bai Jiayu, who had just entered the office. “President Bai.” ”

“Bai Jiayu nodded and walked straight into the office. He said with a cheeky smile, “Brother Song, there’s a party tonight. Are You Going?” ”

“No.”

“Bai Jiayu glanced at song Shiyu. “No Way, Brother Song. Not going again? I say, who are you keeping your virginity for?” ”

Bai Jiayu was really curious about who the cinnabar mole in song Shiyu’s heart was.

Song Shiyu didn’t say anything.

“Bai Jiayu continued, “Are you really not going?” ”

Song Shiyu acknowledged.

“Bai Jiayu sat opposite song Shiyu. “I heard that you’ve already found that little girl from back then. You’re not keeping your virginity for her, are you? Right, who is that girl? Do I know her? Is She Pretty?” ”

“Does it have anything to do with you?”Song Shiyu raised his head and raised his eyebrows.
