“Amazing!”

There were even people who took out their cell phones to take videos.

Ye Sen was also stunned.

“He thought that they were going to crash into each other, and he was even prepared for a car accident to happen. ”

He didn’t expect that ye burning would actually avoid it.

“As an experienced driver, ye Sen naturally knew that if he wasn’t a professional, he wouldn’t be able to operate it at all. ”

“”Niece, did you really just get your driver’s license?”Ye Sen looked at Ye Zao. ”

Ye Zao nodded slightly.

Ye Sen swallowed his throat and suppressed his surprise. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“On the way, as long as there was no speed limit, the speed was very fast. ”

“After a while, they arrived at the airport. ”

“Ye Sen instructed ye Zao, “Zao Zao, remember to drive slowly. Uncle’s points this year will soon be deducted.” ”

“”I know. Uncle, remember to be careful in country P. Remember to call when you arrive.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Sen waved at Ye Zao.

“After leaving the airport, ye Zao did not go home immediately. ”

“Instead, he went to the CEN family. ”

This was not her first time here. The security guards in front of the manor immediately opened the door for her.

Old Mrs. Cen was sitting in the living room watching television.

“When she heard ye Zao’s voice, she thought that she was hallucinating. ”

She looked up.

Oh My God!

It was really her granddaughter-in-law.

Old Mrs. Cen was so excited that she almost jumped up. “Yezi!”

“Grandma Cen.”

“Old Mrs. Cen hurriedly instructed the servants to get some fruits and drinks. “Right, ask the new dessert maker to make more desserts and send them over.” ”

“”Yes, Old Mrs. Cen.” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen held ye Zao’s hand. “Yezi, why didn’t you tell me you were coming so that I could get someone to prepare more delicious food! It’s so hot today, you must be tired! Hurry and sit down!” ”

“”I’m not tired at all.”Ye Zao sat on the sofa with old Mrs. Cen. “Grandma Cen, are you watching ‘The Female Consort’?” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen was watching a DVD, and the title of the movie did not appear on the screen. She did not expect ye Zhuo to know the title of the movie. ”

“‘The Female Consort’was a huangmei opera. It had a very dated feel to it, and very few young people would like it. ”

“Not to mention young people, even Zhou Xiang was not very willing to watch Huangmei Opera. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen said excitedly, “Ye, you’ve also seen the female consort?” ”

Ye Zao nodded. “I have.”

“In her previous life, Ye Zao had studied these intangible cultural heritage. ”

She had dabbled in both Huangmei Opera and Beijing Opera kunqu.

“Then do you know how to Sing?”Old Mrs. Cen continued to ask.

“”I know how to sing.”Ye Zao smiled and said, “Why don’t I Sing for You?” ”

“”Sure, sure!”Old Mrs. Cen was very excited and immediately turned down the volume of the television. ”

“Ye Zhuo was not pretentious. He cleared his throat and opened his mouth to sing,”... The princess grew up in the deep palace, so how would she know the pain of the common women? Third sister Wang has been guarding the cold cave for eighteen years, and Liu Cuiping has been suffering for sixteen years...” ”

This was the most classic play of the female Prince Consort.

“Ye Zhuo’s voice was particularly good. The pitch of his voice rose and fell from low to high, with a unique charm. He sang the helplessness and sadness of the heroine, not losing to a professional at all. ”

Old Mrs. Cen suddenly felt like she had found a soulmate. She immediately took out her phone to record.

She had thought that only an old lady like her liked to listen to plays. She did not expect that her granddaughter-in-law could sing.

“As expected, a family does not enter the same house. ”

“”Yezi, you’re really amazing!”Old Mrs. Cen clapped excitedly. ”

“Ye Zao said modestly, “Just So-so, third in the world.” ”

“I think I’m the best in the world!”

“As Old Mrs. Cen said this, she sent a wechat message to the group chat. ”

It was a voice message.

“After sending the voice message, Old Mrs. Cen looked at Ye Zao. “Oh right, Yezi, I changed my phone and even applied for a wechat account! Shall we add each other on wechat?” ”

“”Sure.”Ye Zao took out his phone. “Grandma Cen, let me scan you.” ”

“Okay.”

“Grandma Cen’s wechat profile picture was like a chubby New Year’s Eve doll, and her wechat name was little cutie. ”

Ye Zhuo’s eyes curved into crescents. He clicked to add little cutie as a friend and added a note: [ lovely Grandma Cen ].

Grandma Cen put on her reading glasses and secretly gave ye Zhuo a note: [ beautiful granddaughter-in-law ] .

“At this moment, a servant brought over desserts and fruits. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen put away her phone. “Yezi, this mousse dessert is delicious! Try It!” ”

Ye Zao took the dessert that old Mrs. Cen handed over.

It was indeed delicious.

It was sweet but not greasy. It melted in the mouth and carried a hint of coolness.

“At this moment, Old Mrs. Cen’s phone rang. ”
