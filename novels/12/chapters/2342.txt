“If it were anyone else, they would never say such things to her. ”

“Bai Jingshu continued, “Great-aunt, you’ve already said what you should say, but I still want to be with Lin Ze. If I really regret it in the future, I definitely won’t blame you.” ”

“Seeing Bai Jingshu like this, Bai Sanfeng’s eyes were filled with confusion. ”

Bai Jingshu had always been a very obedient child in her eyes since she was young.

“But now, Bai Jingshu had actually become so stubborn because of an earthling. ”

“Seeing that the mood of the grandfather and grandson was getting more and more abnormal, elder Bai said in a timely manner, “It’s hot outside, let’s talk inside.” ”

Bai Sanfeng glanced at elder Bai and turned to walk into the house.

Bai Jingshu followed them.

“When they entered the house, the temperature dropped a few degrees. ”

The maid brought them ice-cold water. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Bai Sanfeng sat down and drank a mouthful of water. The ice-cold water entered her throat, and she calmed down a little. ”

“She knew that she couldn’t push things too hard sometimes, especially since Bai Jingshu and Lin Ze were in a hot relationship right now, bai sanfeng continued, “Jingshu, there won’t be a result between you and that Earthling. Even if there is a result, it won’t be a good one. “You’re a smart child. I don’t want you to be confused about such things.” ”

“”Great-aunt, we’ve only just started. How do you know that we won’t have a good result?”Bai Jingshu retorted. ”

“Bai Sanfeng looked at Bai Jingshu, “If you don’t know anything else, you should at least know the story of the Cowherd and the seven fairies, right? If it wasn’t for the cowherd’s selfishness and stealing the clothes of the seven fairies, would the seven fairies have gone from an unreachable wife to a farmer’s wife?” ”

“Everyone said that the story of the Cowherd and the seven fairies was beautiful and moving, but Bai Sanfeng could see the sadness in it. ”

“The seven fairies were the seventh daughter of the Jade Emperor and the Queen Mother. They were doted on and did not live in the mortal world. It was because the cowherd stole her clothes that she could not fly, so she stayed in the mortal world to give birth to children for the cowherd. ”

“The pure seven fairies had never come into contact with men before, so how could she know the Cowherd’s evil intentions. ”

“In fact, Liu Lang did not love the seven fairies at all. He just needed a wife to carry on the family line. If he had stolen the clothes of other fairies, he would have had children with other fairies as well. ”

“Therefore, the beautiful legends in fairy tales were all lies. Bai Sanfeng never believed in such ethereal things. ”

“”You’re like the seven fairies in fairy tales now. You’ve been deceived by Lin Ze!”Bai Sanfeng turned to look at Master Bai, “It’s one thing for Jingshu to be tricked at such a young age, but how old are you? You’re Jingshu’s grandfather. You have to be responsible for Jingshu!” ”

“Old Master Bai stood up and personally poured a cup of tea for Bai Sanfeng, “Elder sister, you know how I see people. Just Trust me this once. Although Xiao Lin is from Earth, he’s more reliable than anyone else in the s galaxy! There’s no mistake between Jingshu and him!” ”

“Bai Sanfeng looked at the stubborn old master Bai and an evil aura welled up in her heart. She wanted to say something, but in the end, she didn’t say anything. ”

“”Forget it, forget it.”Bai Sanfeng stood up from her chair. “No matter how good I am, I’m just a great-aunt. You two can do whatever you want! Anyway, I’ve already said what I need to say!” ”

“She had already said what she could, but Bai Jingshu did not listen. What else could she do? ”

She could not just force her head down!

That would be meaningless.

“”Great-aunt, please don’t be angry.”Bai Jingshu stood up and held Bai Sanfeng’s hand. “I definitely won’t regret it.” ”

Bai Sanfeng turned to look at Bai Jingshu. “As long as you don’t cry next to me and say that you regret it in the future!”

“”Don’t worry, I Promise I won’t,”Bai Jingshu said. ”

“Bai Sanfeng was still angry, so she couldn’t be bothered with Bai Jingshu. “That’s it! I’m going back first.” ”

“”Great-aunt, it’s not easy for you to come here. Why are you going back so soon? Stay here for a few days, and I can accompany you more,”Bai Jingshu said. ”

“Bai Sanfeng withdrew her hand and said coldly, “There’s no need. Anyway, if you marry to Earth in the future, we won’t see each other anymore!” ”

“After saying that, Bai Sanfeng turned around and left. ”

“Bai Jingzhu wanted to catch up with Bai Sanfeng, but old master Bai waved his hand, indicating that she shouldn’t chase after her. ”

“It wasn’t until Bai Sanfeng’s figure disappeared in front of them that old master Bai lowered his voice and said, “Your great-aunt has such a temper. She’s sharp-tongued but soft-hearted. She’ll be fine after this period of time. Just let her be.” ”
