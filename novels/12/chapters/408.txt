“Chapter 409: 118: The Great Burning Trap reveals Mu Yourong’s true colors, Li Qiandong collapses! 5”

“At this moment, there was a knock on the door. ”

Mu Yourong’s eyes lit up.

It was fifth master Cen!

She hurriedly stood up to open the door.

“A tall figure stood outside the door, enveloping mu yourong. ”

A bashful expression appeared on Mu Yourong’s face as she raised her head to look at Cen Shaoqing.

“When she raised her head, Mu Yourong was immediately stunned. ”

“This, this was not Cen Shaoqing! ”

“Who are you?”Mu Yourong vigilantly took a step back.

“The man looked at Mu Yourong like this, “My surname is Xu, and I am Fifth Master’s Special Assistant! Fifth Master wanted me to tell you that a shameless woman like you does not even have the qualifications to step into the CEN family’s gates and become a servant for the Cen family, so stop daydreaming! “Have some sense of shame, and also leave some dignity for yourself!” ”

Mu Yourong’s face instantly turned deathly white.

I know!

So he knows!

Everything was under his control.

“Mu Yourong felt like she was a clown, being toyed with in the palm of someone’s hand. ”

“She had carefully prepared, and not only did she not receive Cen Shaoqing, she even received a round of humiliation! ”

But she was not willing!

She was not willing to be deceived by Cen Shaoqing just like that.

What should she do now?

What should she do now?

“She could wait, but her stomach could not wait any longer. ”

Mu Yourong placed her hand on her abdomen.

Yes.

She was pregnant.

She had originally wanted to use this opportunity to make Cen Shaoqing the rightful father of the child in her stomach.

“Once she became pregnant, would she still be afraid of not being able to enter the Cen Family? ”

“But now, her plans were all in a mess! ”

Cen Shaoqing did not come to see her at all!

To abort the child?

No Way!

“Her constitution was special, so she could not abort the child. ”

“Once she aborted the child, she would never be able to conceive a child in the future! ”

What should she do now?

“At this moment, Mu Yourong thought of someone. ”

Li Qiandong!

“Although Li Qiandong’s family background was not as good as Cen Shaoqing’s, he was still a noble son of a wealthy family in the capital! ”

“Most importantly, Li Qiandong and Cen Shaoqing were good brothers. Even if she really got together with Li Qiandong, she would still have a chance to get in touch with Cen Shaoqing in the future. ”

“However, she had to plan everything in advance to make Li Qiandong feel guilty towards her. ”

“After returning from the hotel, Mu Yourong went to the market to buy a bunch of vegetables and started cooking. ”

“About two hours later, Mu Yourong called Li Qiandong. “Hello, brother Li?” ”

“It’s me.”

“Mu yourong continued, “Brother Li, where are you now? You’ve helped me so much during this period of time. I want to treat you to a meal. If you’re free, come over now. I’ve prepared a whole table of dishes.” ”

Li Qiandong had originally wanted to refuse. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“But when he heard Mu Yourong say that she had prepared a table full of dishes, he agreed. ”

What did he do in this life to be able to eat the dishes that Mu Yourong had personally prepared.

Li Qiandong arrived very quickly.

“A table full of dishes, with all kinds of color, fragrance, and taste. Whether it was in terms of appearance or fragrance, it was not one bit inferior to a five-star chef. ”

Li Qiandong sighed in his heart. Mu Yourong was truly a good wife and mother!

“However, Cen Shaoqing had eyes but not eyes. ”

“Ye Zhuo was clearly not even half as good as Mu Yourong, but Cen Shaoqing could only see Ye Zhuo. ”

“Mu Yourong opened a bottle of wine and filled it up for Li Qiandong. She poured herself a cup and said, “Big Brother Li, this cup is a toast to you. Thank you for your help during this period of time!” ”

“Mu Yourong finished the wine in her cup in one gulp. After finishing it, she began to cough violently. ”

“”Yourong, are you alright?”Li Qiandong looked at her nervously. ”

“”I’m fine, I’m fine. I just don’t know how to drink.”Mu yourong continued, “Big Brother Li, you drink too.” ”

Li Qiandong also finished the wine in his cup in one gulp.

“Mu Yourong watched as he finished the wine in his cup, then poured him another cup. ”

“Just like that, one cup after another. ”

“In the end, Li Qiandong’s consciousness also became blurry. His body was extremely hot and he began to unbutton his shirt. ”

“Mu yourong said, “Big Brother Li, let me help you to your room to rest.” ”

Li Qiandong was completely confused at this moment. He treated Mu Yourong as his usual female companion and kissed her on the face.

“”Big Brother Li, you can’t do this!”Mu Yourong struggled for a while, but in the end, she was unable to struggle. ”

“When Li Qiandong woke up the next morning, he felt that the surrounding environment was not quite right. ”

Where was this?

“At this moment, he suddenly saw Mu Yourong lying beside him! ”

Li Qiandong turned pale with fright and suddenly remembered what had happened last night.

He had drunk too much and had mistaken her for someone else.

He had forced Mu Yourong!

Oh My God!
