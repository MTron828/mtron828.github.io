“How old were you when you were thrown away?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

“”Not even three years old.”Now that she recalled the past, Ye Zhuo no longer felt anything. There was no expression on her face either, she continued, “One day, when I woke up, I suddenly found myself in a very strange place. My body was dirty... I don’t remember who I am or what my name is...” ”

“Later, after verification, it was not that she did not remember, but that man Jiangshan and Zhao Dan had drugged her, causing her to lose her memory. ”

“However, all of this was no longer important. ”

“Now, she had a new life. ”

“”At that time, did you ever think of looking for your parents?”Cen Shaoqing asked. ”

“Ye Zhuo nodded slightly, “Of course I did. After all, other children have their own parents. When I slowly grew up, I didn’t want to look for them anymore. Later, Grandma told me that perhaps they had no other choice but to abandon me, so I started to investigate in secret.” ”

“Who knew that in the end, it would end up like this. ”

“”Later on, I buried this secret in my heart forever.” ”

“Ye Zhuo said it lightly, but Cen Shaoqing’s eyes were full of pity. ”

A child who was not even three years old had been wandering the streets all the way to become the famous miss ye of Chang Yue. No one knew how difficult the process was.

Behind this glory was a path paved with blood and tears.

Cen Shaoqing walked over and gently hugged ye Zhuo.

“”Leader, you’ll have me in the future.” ”

“En.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

...

On the other side.

In the General Alliance.

Wang Meilin came to Duanmu Fengyu’s office.

“Miss.”

Duanmu Fengyu raised her head. “How are things going?”

“Wang Meilin continued, “The core robot has been arranged. But it hasn’t arrived on Earth yet.” ”

“How long will it take?”Duanmu Fengyu asked.

“”About five days,”Wang Meilin answered. ”

“Five days?”Duanmu fengyu frowned.

“Wang Meilin explained, “The s galaxy is too far from the Milky Way. Currently, the fastest speed of our interstellar shuttle is five days.” ”

“Hearing this, Duanmu Fengyu narrowed his eyes and continued, “I remember miss ye from the state of Changyue once invented a shuttle that could travel to various planets in less than three days.”For the current Duanmu Fengyu.., time was life. Every inch of time was worth an inch of gold. This was because no one knew what would happen in the next second on Earth! ”

What if that woman on Earth had already plotted to have Dongli’s child and was about to give birth?

“Once the future ruler-in-waiting was born, she really wouldn’t have a chance. ”

She wanted to nip all the dangers in the bud.

“Wang Meilin shook her head. “I’m not too sure about that either. Miss, I’ll go check it out.” ” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Go ahead.”Duanmu Fengyu waved her hand.

Wang Meilin left the office.

Duanmu Fengyu sat in front of her desk. A sinister light flashed in her beautiful eyes.

“Soon, Wang Meilin returned. ”

“Miss.”

“How is it?”Duanmu Fengyu looked up at Wang Meilin.

“Wang Meilin continued, “Miss Ye did invent an interstellar shuttle that could travel to any planet within three days...” ”

“And then?”Duanmu Fengyu asked.

“Wang Meilin continued, “But after Miss Ye took her place, Miss Ye took the shuttle away. Now, Miss Ye has lost contact with everyone.” ”

“Hearing this, Duanmu Fengyu frowned. ”

She didn’t expect ye Zhuo to be taken away by the interstellar shuttle.

So what happened now?

“At this moment, Wang Meilin suddenly thought of something and said, “Oh right, Miss, I found something else.” ”

“What is it?”Duanmu Fengyu asked.

“Wang Meilin continued, “According to the Great Elder, Young Master Dongli’s girlfriend on Earth has the surname Ye. I think... She’s also called Ye Zhuo.” ”

Also called ye Zao?

Duanmu Fengyu’s lips curled into a disdainful smile. “So What? Could that low-level woman from Earth become Miss Ye?”

“”I also heard...”at this point, Wang Meilin’s voice became hesitant. ”

“Heard what?”Duanmu Fengyu asked.

“Wang Meilin continued, “I heard that young master Dongli’s girlfriend also looks a little similar to miss ye. Coincidentally, Miss Ye took the throne at this critical moment. Do you think they happen to be the same person?” ”

The same person?

“Hearing this, Duanmu Fengyu laughed out loud. “Even if she looks like Miss Ye, it’s just an imitation.” ”
