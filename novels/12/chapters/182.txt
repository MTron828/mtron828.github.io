Chapter 183: 087: so it’s Ye Zhuo! Old Lady Cen is trying to trick Cen Shaoqing! 3

It would be a lie to say that she wasn’t shocked!

If she hadn’t seen it with her own eyes, who would believe that a down-and-out fake daughter who had been kicked out would be so powerful?

If the Mu family found out that they mistook the pearl for a fish’s eye, they would probably regret it to death!

Zhou xiang continued, “Zhuozhuo, let me introduce you to my son, Cen Shaoqing. You call him...”

At this point, Zhou Xiang was stunned. Ye Zhuo called her sister Zhou Xiang, and she also treated ye Zhuo as a younger sister.

Then what should ye Zhuo call Cen Shaoqing?

There seemed to be something wrong with this seniority.

For a moment, Zhou Xiang was in a bit of a dilemma.

Ye Zhuo smiled slightly and looked at Cen Shaoqing. “Hello, Nephew.”

Cen Shaoqing:”...” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

So, he had an extra cheap aunt?

After saying that, ye Zhuo continued, “Don’t mind if I’m just joking!”

“I don’t mind,”Cen Shaoqing said gently.

......

Hearing that, Zhou Xiang’s eyes were filled with surprise.

What did she just hear?

She heard Cen Shaoqing not mind.

As Cen Shaoqing’s mother, no one knew Cen Shaoqing better than Zhou Xiang.

Cen Shaoqing had been very strange since he was young.

His face was cold, but his heart was colder.

He did not like to be close to girls.

He always put on a poker face to girls, and he had a history of scaring girls into crying before.

When he was older, he became a vegetarian and started to believe in Buddha.

He was clearly a young man in his twenties, but he was as serious as an old man.

He did not expect that Cen Shaoqing would be so easy to talk to.

Ye Zao had taken advantage of him verbally, but he did not mind!

There was hope!

Very Hope!

Very Hope!

Zhou Xiang’s eyes darted back and forth between the two of them before she continued, “Zao Zao, you and Shaoqing, did the two of you know each other a long time ago?”

Ye Zao nodded. “Yes, Sister Zhou Xiang. I’ve known him for two to three months.”

Cen Shaoqing was not the only one who was surprised that ye Zao was the godly doctor who had cured old madam Cen.

Ye Zao was also very surprised. So Cen Shaoqing was the eldest grandson that old Madam Cen had mentioned!

One had to admit that fate was really a wonderful thing.

Hearing that.

Zhou Xiang’s eyes were filled with excitement.

So there was really a chance!

Since there was a chance, then the issue of seniority could not be messed with, zhou Xiang held ye Zao’s hand and said, “Zao Zao, you should still call me auntie in the future! I’m already so old, taking advantage of a little girl like you. Outsiders will laugh at me if they hear it.”

Ye Zao nodded slightly. “Okay.”

If she kept calling Zhou Xiang sister, then Cen Shaoqing would indeed be quite embarrassed.

At this moment, old Mrs. Cen walked over with the box in her arms.

“Yezi!”

“Grandma Cen.”

Old Mrs. Cen carried the box and walked past Cen Shaoqing. She directly walked to ye Zao’s side and sat down. “Yezi, Guess What’s delicious in this box?”After saying that, she was afraid that ye Zao wouldn’t be able to guess, she added, “There is a kind of fruit inside. The round fruit inside is white! Moreover, it is a kind of fruit that imperial consort Yang likes to eat the most!”

Cen Shaoqing:”...”if she could not guess it, then she would be a pig.

“Lychee?”Ye Zao blurted out.

“Yes, yes, yes! Yezi, you are really smart! You can even guess it!”As expected of the granddaughter-in-law that she had taken a fancy to! She was just that smart! She was just that amazing!

Zhou Xiang chimed in from the side, “That’s right! Who’s smart if not scorching hot? Not only is scorching hot very smart, but she’s also good-looking too? What does she mean by being extremely smart? She can topple a nation! Just look at scorching hot and you’ll know!”

Even someone as narcissistic as ye Zhuo felt a little embarrassed after being praised by the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law.

Cen Shaoqing: ? ? ?

Old Mrs. Cen opened the box and revealed Litchi with a tinge of green and red, “Zao Zao, this is the Litchi I specially saved for you. It’s preserved with high-tech. Don’t think that it’s winter now, it’s actually very fresh. Try One!”

Cen Shaoqing’s hand that was holding the Buddha bead paused.

If he was not mistaken, this was the Green Litchi that old Mrs. Cen had specially asked someone to buy from other places when she returned to the capital for the New Year last year.

Although lychees were not rare, lychees with green varieties were especially rare!

Other lychees were sold by the catty

Only the green lychees were sold by the number of lychees.

At the previous auction, a single green lychee was sold for a sky-high price of 550,000 yuan.

Someone once joked that this was not eating lychees, but eating houses.

Because the time was not right, the old lady cen treasured this box of lychees even more. Usually, she did not even let him touch it, but she did not expect it to be so generous today.

One had to know that this box had a total of 56 hanging greens!
