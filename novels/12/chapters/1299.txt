“Since Old Madam Cen had spoken, Zhou Xiang did not say anything else. “Then let’s go eat first.” ”

The few of them stood up from the sofa and walked in the direction of the dining room.

“When Xie Wanqiu and Zheng Wanyin returned from outside, it was already past two in the afternoon. ”

“Zhou Xiang immediately went up to them. “Mom, Wanyin, have you eaten? If you haven’t eaten, I’ll ask the kitchen to save some food for you!” ”

“Zheng wanyin smiled and said, “Second aunt, there’s no need to be busy. Grandma and I have already eaten.” ”

Xie wanqiu looked at Zhou Xiang and her expression did not look good. “You guys have already eaten?”

“Yes.”Zhou Xiang nodded.

It’s the other way around!

It’s the other way around!

They did not even wait for their grandma to start eating.

Did this group of people still think highly of her?

“Xie wanqiu put on a fake smile. “Since we’ve already eaten, what’s there to ask! Where’s the eldest and third girl?” ”

“”They’re inside,”Zhou Xiang replied. ”

Xie wanqiu brought Zheng Wanyin inside.

“When they saw Xie wanqiu enter, Cen Yuying and CEN yueying immediately stood up to greet her. “Grandma, Cousin Wanyin.” ”

“”Eldest cousin, third cousin.”Zheng Wanyin ran over with a smile and greeted Cen Yuying and Cen Yueying. “Why didn’t I see second cousin and fourth cousin?” ”

“At the moment, they didn’t know that Cen Yuyan had fallen out with the Cen family. ”

“Ever since Cen Yuyan left the CEN family, she had never contacted her family again. ”

“Cen yuying smiled and said, “They had some matters to attend to and left the country!” ”

“OH.”Zheng Wanyin nodded.

“Cen Yuying hurriedly gestured for Xie Wanqiu to sit down. “Grandma, you must be tired from shopping. Quickly sit down and rest.” ”

“Xie wanqiu sat down next to Zheng Wanyin. “Big Lass, third lass, you’ve been quite busy recently?” ”

“Cen Yuying nodded. “Yes, it’s the end of the year. I’m quite busy.” ”

So busy that she didn’t even have time to meet her grandma?

“Moreover, she had already sat down for so long, but she hadn’t heard that the two sisters had prepared a gift for her. ”

“She was their grandma. Most importantly, she hadn’t come to the capital for many years. If it was someone else’s granddaughter, she would definitely have bought a lot of gifts for Grandma. ”

But what about Cen Yuying and Cen Yueying?

They were empty-handed!

“In their hearts, did they still have a grandmother like him? ”

“The more Xie Wanqiu thought about it, the angrier she got. She stood up and said, “I’m a little tired. I want to go upstairs and rest for a while.” ”

“Zheng Wanyin was chatting happily with Cen Yuying when she suddenly heard Xie Wanqiu say that. Zheng Wanyin immediately followed suit. “Grandma, I’ll accompany you upstairs.” ”

Xie wanqiu nodded.

The two of them went upstairs together.

“Cen Yueying looked at their backs and muttered softly, “What’s wrong with them!” ”

“They went upstairs, xie wanqiu said indignantly, “It’s fine if they don’t see me as their Grandma! But you’re the only cousin among them. They didn’t even bring you a present! Other People’s cousins are buying houses and jewelry for their cousins. Look at them! Pui! What are they!” ”

“Zheng Wanyin was her granddaughter that she held in her hands. However, the Cen family did not take Zheng Wanyin to heart. ”

Xie Wanqiu wanted to curse out loud.

“However, this was not the Zhou family after all. She could only lower her voice. ” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Zheng Wanyin held onto Xie Wanqiu’s arm. “Grandma, I’m Fine! Don’t be like this. Eldest cousin and third cousin don’t have the obligation to buy things for me!” ”

“”A kind person will be bullied! You’re used to being bullied!”Xie wanqiu placed her hands on her hips. “Yinyin, just you wait! Grandma will definitely find a good future for you. A good husband! Let your Cen family’s mistress!” ”

Zheng Wanyin covered her mouth in surprise. “Grandma! What nonsense are you spouting!”

“I’m not spouting nonsense!”

Xie wanqiu had been thinking about this matter for a long time.

Zheng Wanyin had to marry into the Cen family!

This could also be considered to make up for the regret that Xie Lingli could not marry into the Cen family.

Xie Lingli was Xie Wanqiu’s biological daughter. She had no blood relations with the Zhou family.

And Zheng Wanyin was really Xie Lingli’s daughter.

In the CEN family.

“Zhou Xiang was not in charge. The Cen Old Lady was already very old. Even if she could live for another ten years, in ten years, she would only be a pile of dirt. ”

“Once Zheng Wanyin married into the Cen family, then Zheng Wanyin would be the true master of the Cen Family! ”

“At that time, she would be the rightful matriarch of the Cen family! ”

“Xie wanqiu continued, “You are not related to Shaoqing by blood, what are you afraid of! Besides, it should have been your mother who married into the Cen family that year. It was Zhou Xiang who was shameless enough to snatch away your mother’s ideal husband!” ”

“Actually, in the beginning, the matchmaker wanted to set Xie Lingli up with Cen Haifeng. ”
