Ye Shu was very anxious.

“After all, Ye Sen could not be delayed now. He continued, “Then can I trouble you to go in and ask when Doctor Li is free?” ”

The nurse was a little impatient. “I’m not too sure about that either.”

Ye Shu frowned and was about to say something else.

“Forget it.”Ye Zhuo pulled ye Shu’s hand.

Ye Zao took out his phone and sent a message.

The reply came very quickly.

“Soon, the ringtone of his phone rang in the air. ”

“Ye Shu turned to look at ye Zao. “Zao Zao, who called?” ”

“Ye Zao said, “It should be their director.”Actually, ye Zao did not want to alert the higher-ups, but the situation was urgent and doctor Li did not appear, so she could only contact the higher-ups. ”

“After saying that, ye Zao swiped his phone to answer. “Hello.” ”

“Okay.”

“After saying that, he hung up the phone. ”

“Ye Shu immediately asked, “Zao Zao, is it their director?” ”

“Yes.”

“”OH.”Ye Shu nodded and continued, “Then will the director come?” ”

“”Right away,”ye Zao answered. ”

The director will come?

“When the nurse heard this, her eyes were full of ridicule. ”

Did Ye Zao really think that the director would meet everyone?

The director would come here personally to look for her?

How could that be possible!

This was simply a dream!

“He wanted to pretend to be thirteen in front of her, but he didn’t even make any preparations. ”

What kind of thirteen could be pretended to be thirteen?

Ding —

“Just then, the sound of an elevator notification came from the corridor. ”

A figure in a white coat walked over in a hurry.

“Behind him were two doctors, a man and a woman. ”

Who was that?

“The director, the deputy director, and the director. ”

The nurses were stunned when they saw the three big shots.

The director?

The director was really here!

Why was the director here?

Could it be because of ye Zao?

No Way?

Why did ye Zao Make the director come personally?

It was a coincidence.

It must be a coincidence!

“Under the nurse’s stunned gaze, the hospital director walked to Ye Zhuo’s side. “Hello, Miracle Doctor Ye. I’m the hospital director of the first People’s Hospital, Zhang Bo. This is our hospital’s vice hospital director, Wang Hai. This is director Ma Tao!” ”

“”Miracle Doctor Ye, I’m Wang Hai.” ”

“”Hello, I’m Ma Tao.” ”

“The nurse looked at the three big shots, who were usually as serious as old cadres, bowing and bowing to a little girl with such a respectful attitude! ”

Unbelievable!

It was simply unbelievable.

“The nurse almost could not believe what she saw. She reached out to wipe her eyes, but the scene before her eyes did not change. ”

“Moreover, if she did not hear wrongly, the three tycoons were not only very respectful to ye Zao, but also called him Godly Doctor Ye. ”

Godly Doctor Ye?

There were not many people who could be called Godly doctor ye by the three tycoons. It could almost be said that there were none.

Could it be...

This young girl in front of him was the famous Miracle Doctor Ye who cured cancer?

“How, how could it be! ”

“She was so young, how could she be Miracle Doctor Ye. ”

“Miracle Doctor Ye had cured cancer, so he would be at least fifty to sixty years old. ”

The nurse gulped.

“Before she could react, the director continued, “Xiao Wang, where’s doctor Li?” ” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“”He’s, he’s inside!”The nurse stuttered. ”

Director Zhang’s expression was very ugly. “Why didn’t he come out when he was inside? Why did he have to get Miracle Doctor Ye to invite him personally? What arrogance!”

“Xiao Wang hurriedly said, “I, I’ll go get doctor Li right away.” ”

“Director Zhang’s face was stern as he continued, “Tell him to come to my office immediately!” ”

“After saying that, he turned to look at Ye Zhuo and said respectfully, “Godly Doctor Ye, Mrs. Lin, please follow me.” ”

Ye Zhuo and Ye Shu followed director Zhang’s footsteps.

Little Wang came to the office.

“Doctor Li was sorting out the medical records when he heard footsteps. He said without raising his head, “Why? Ye Sen’s family still refuses to leave?” ”

“Little Wang swallowed with some difficulty. “No, no.” ”

“Then what’s the matter?”

“”Doctor Li, we’re in trouble,”Xiao Wang said. ”

“What trouble?”The doctor put down his pen and looked up at Xiao Li.

“Xiao Wang continued, “Ye Sen’s niece is Miracle Doctor Ye.” ”

“Afraid that doctor Li did not know who Miracle Doctor Ye was, Xiao Wang added, “It’s, it’s that Miracle Doctor Ye who cured cancer.” ”

“What!”Doctor Li’s face turned pale.

“Xiao Wang said, “Even the director, deputy director, and director Ma are here! Ye Sen’s niece is indeed Miracle Doctor Ye...” ”

“Doctor Li continued, “But didn’t you say that the other party is a seventeen or eighteen-year-old child?” ”

“If he had known that the other party was Miracle Doctor Ye, he definitely would not have refused to see him. ”
