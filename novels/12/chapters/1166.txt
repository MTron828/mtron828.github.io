Translator: 549690339

Everyone was filled with confidence in ye Zhuo.

“On the other hand, Zhao Xueyin, the acting first seat, had unknowingly been neglected by everyone. ”

Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly. “I...”

“Before she could finish her sentence, she was interrupted by Zhao Xueyin. “Elder Feng is right. Indeed, we should let Qian Zhuo design the logo for us. Please don’t worry about this matter. Leave it to me.” ”

“You?”Ye Zhuo raised his eyes slightly.

“Zhao Xueyin looked at Ye Zhuo. “Why? President Ye, are you afraid that I won’t be able to invite Qian Zhuo?” ”

“Are you sure you can invite her?”Ye Zhuo asked back.

“Zhao Xueyin put on a fake smile. “President Ye, you should worry about the Jiang Financial Group first before you worry about me!”After saying that, Zhao Xueyin looked at the board of directors, “Uncles, please rest assured. I have some friendship with Qian Zhuo. I will definitely be able to invite Qian Zhuo to design the LOGO for us.” ”

“Hearing that, everyone discussed animatedly. ”

They did not expect Zhao Xueyin to actually know shallow drinking!

That was shallow drinking.

The big shot who designed the national seal!

“”Xueyin, you’re the same. Why didn’t you tell us earlier that you knew shallow drinking! You Made US worried!” ”

Zhao Xueyin curled her lips slightly. “It’s not anything worth showing off.”

“Then I’ll leave this matter to you!”

“After the meeting ended, Ye Zhuo returned to his office and started to get busy. ”

“Ever since she agreed to cooperate with the Jiang Corporation, Ye Zhuo had become busier. When she got busy, she was practically deaf to everything outside the window. She didn’t even know when Cen Shaoqing had entered. ”

“Ye Zhuo just sat in front of his desk and lowered his head slightly. His eyes were serious. As long as he raised his head, he would be able to see her profile. Her slender eyelashes left a faint silhouette on the bridge of her nose. ”

She was as beautiful as jade.

“It was said that when a person was focused on doing something, he would attract the most attention and also be the most charming. ”

This sentence was most suitable for ye Zao.

“Cen Shaoqing raised his eyes slightly. “Leader, do you need help?” ”

“When did you come?”Ye Zao raised his eyes slightly.

Cen Shaoqing connected the Buddha beads. “Just now.”

“Ye Zao continued, “Pour me a glass of water.” ”

“Right away.”Cen Shaoqing placed the Buddha beads on the table and got up to pour ye Zao some water.

“A moment later, Cen Shaoqing’s voice came from the inside. “Leader, do you want to add lemon slices?” ”

“”Yes.”Ye Zao continued, “Remember to add more honey.” ”

“Okay.”

Cen Shaoqing transformed into a small assistant and made ye Zao a cup of Lemon Honey Water.

“After a while, Cen Shaoqing placed the cup on the table. “Leader, drink some water.” ”

“Ye Zhuo picked up the cup and took a sip of water. “Also, take this to print out a copy.” ”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing picked up the document without any complaints.

The printing room was on the first floor.

Cen Shaoqing’s appearance caused everyone to discuss animatedly.

“”Oh my God, he’s so handsome! When did our consortium get such a top-notch product?” ”

“The uniform is so tempting!”

“Who wants a Wechat?”

“”Rock, paper, scissors, whoever wins will go!” ”

“At this moment, a long-haired woman came over with a document. “Save it! You’re still thinking about wechat! Do you know who he is?” ” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Who is it?”

“Isn’t he an employee of our consortium?”

“The long-haired woman continued, “He’s President Ye’s boyfriend, Cen Fifth Master.” ”

“”F * ck! Cen Wuye! The Cen family, the number one family in China?” ”

“”That’s right, it’s that Cen Family!” ”

“Oh my God! These two people are too compatible!”

“I heard that Cen Wuye doesn’t marry and is a vegetarian. It seems that rumors can not even be believed in punctuation!”

“You’re not alone! I also heard that Cen Wuye doesn’t marry.”

“”President Ye is so beautiful. Not to mention Cen Wuye doesn’t marry, even if Cen Wuye is a real monk, he would still be tempted, right?” ”

“”That’s right! If I were a man, I would also chase after Miss Ye!” ”

“”Oh right, if he’s Cen Wuye, why would he appear in the printing room?” ”

“What’s so bad about being in the printing room? I just saw him go to the finance department! It looks like he’s doing odd jobs for President Ye!”

Odd Jobs?

Cen Wuye was actually doing odd jobs for Shunxi Financial Group!

“”Damn, what kind of godly love is this?” ”

“How doting!”

“The tyrannical president turned into an odd jobs assistant? I want to have such a boyfriend too.”

“I’m so envious of President Ye!”

“Everyone spoke one after another, and their words were filled with envy for Ye Zhuo. ”

That was Cen Wuye!

It had always been others who did odd jobs for Cen Wuye. When had Cen Wuye ever been so willing to do odd jobs for others?
