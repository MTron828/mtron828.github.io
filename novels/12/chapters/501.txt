Translator: 549690339

Looking at Ye Zao.

“For a moment, Lin Jincheng was stunned. He could not react in time. His mind was blank. ”

Did he miss something?

“After a long while, Lin Jincheng found his voice. “Ah Shu, this, this... is our daughter?” ”

Ye Shu sighed and nodded. “Her name is ye Zao.”

“No matter what, Lin Jincheng was also ye Zao’s father. The misunderstanding between her and Lin Jincheng couldn’t involve the child in it. ”

She couldn’t stop ye Zao from acknowledging his father either.

“Hearing this, Lin Jincheng, who had calmed down, instantly broke the dam again. ”

It really was!

This was really his and Ye Shu’s daughter.

“The girl in front of him looked extremely similar to him and ye Shu. Even without a paternity test, it could be seen that this was his daughter. ”

His daughter’s name was ye Zao.

So Ye Yourong was not ye Shu’s daughter at all!

He had made a mistake.

“From the beginning to the end, this was all a misunderstanding. ”

“But why had he not seen ye Zao when he went to the cloud capital at that time, but only ye Yourong? ”

Lin Jincheng only hated himself for not investigating the matter clearly back then.

“Lin Jincheng looked at ye Zao, his expression as if he had lost control. His lips trembled and he could not say a single word. Boiling hot tears surged into his eyes. His heart, which he had painstakingly pieced together, was now torn apart by someone. ”

He was not good.

It was all his fault.

“When he saw the identification book, he felt as if the sky had collapsed. He did not expect that the child was not ye Shu’s at all. ”

He was too weak.

He did not have the responsibility of being a father.

He had actually let the mother and daughter suffer for so many years.

“Ye Shu also had mixed feelings in her heart. She held ye Zao’s hand for a long time before saying in a hoarse voice, “Zao Zao, this is your father.” ”

“Ye Zao did not have a father in his previous life, nor did he have one in this life. ”

The sudden appearance of a man who could see her figure in his facial features made ye Zao a little confused.

She originally thought that Lin Jincheng was a scumbag who played with other people’s feelings.

“If Lin Jincheng was a scumbag, she would definitely close the door and release the dog without hesitation! ”

“However, things were not what she thought. ”

“There was a misunderstanding between Lin Jincheng and ye Shu. It was a deep misunderstanding. He even lost one of his legs and became a vegetable in bed for ten years. From her daughter’s point of view, she was not qualified to judge Lin Jincheng. ”

“Moreover, from ye Shu’s eyes, it could be seen that she still had Lin Jincheng in her heart. Before these misunderstandings were resolved, she even had hope for Lin Jincheng. Otherwise, she would not have been unmarried for nineteen years. ”

She had been waiting for Lin Jincheng’s answer.

“Perhaps, from the bottom of her heart, Ye Shu also believed that Lin Jincheng wasn’t a scumbag who played around with other people’s feelings. ”

“Ye Shu was different from her parents and several older sisters of the Ye family. She was very good-looking and had the temperament of a pitiful sister Lin. Even if she was single and had a child, she didn’t lack suitors by her side. ”

“However, regardless of whether the other party was rich or single and unmarried, she did not agree. ”

She had been waiting for the child for nineteen years.

“Lin Jincheng was the same. He had always had ye Shu in his heart. For nineteen years, he had never married. ”

“If ye Shu wanted to get back together with Lin Jincheng, ye Zhuo would not object. ”

“After all, there was another child between them. ”

She also had an older brother.

Lin Ze was mentally and physically exhausted in order to find ye Shu previously.

“For Lin Ze’s sake, ye Zao would not object to Ye Shu’s decision. ”

“Lin Jincheng only felt a lump in his throat. His footsteps seemed to weigh thousands of pounds as he walked step by step to Ye Zao’s side. He said in a hoarse voice, “Zao Zao... Child, I’m sorry, I’m sorry to you and your mother... I’m sorry...” ”

Lin Jincheng regretted not taking ye Shu away in time nineteen years ago.

He also regretted being too cowardly in cloud capital last year and not investigating the matter clearly.

All of this was his fault.

He was the one who let them down.

“He had a thousand words to say, but he wanted to cry first. After a long while, Lin Jincheng said, “Child... you can, can forgive father. Give father a chance to make up for you and your mother...” ”

They had missed nineteen years.

“At this moment, Lin Jincheng only wanted to spend the rest of his life doing his best to make up for ye Shu and Ye Zhuo. ”

Ye Zhuo looked at Lin Jincheng like this. There seemed to be a layer of clear snow between his brows. “I’m sorry. I don’t have the right to forgive you on behalf of my mother.”

Lin Jincheng turned to look at Ye Shu. “Ah Shu...”

“Mother...”Lin ze also looked at Ye Shu. His eyes were full of desire.
