“Looking at Ouyang Chen who was catching up, he ziteng frowned slightly. However, since she was a girl, he couldn’t just throw a tantrum. ”

He hated it when girls cried the most!

Especially when it came to a delicate young lady like Ouyang Chen.

“He ziteng came to the front of the car, opened the door of the driver’s seat, and closed it with a bang. He thought that Ouyang Chen wouldn’t follow, but when he turned his head, he saw Ouyang Chen sitting in the front passenger seat. ” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“He ziteng was speechless and continued, “I’m sorry, Miss Ouyang. I want to leave the passenger seat to my future girlfriend.” ”

“Ouyang Chen smiled and looked at He ziteng. “It’s okay. I believe that one day, I will become your girlfriend.” ”

Become his girlfriend?

He did not know where Ouyang Chen’s confidence came from.

He Ziteng was so angry that he was about to laugh!

“”I won’t,”he ziteng continued, “You’re not my type. Besides, I’ve already confessed to the person I like. If nothing goes wrong, we’ll be together soon.” ”

“But aren’t you two not together yet?”Ouyang Chen tilted her head and looked at He ziteng.

“”But I’ve already confessed,”he ziteng continued, “Even if she doesn’t accept me, I won’t be with you because you’re not my type at all!” ”

“Then I can work hard.”Ouyang Chen looked at he ziteng very seriously. “What kind of girl do you like? I can change myself.”

He Ziteng felt that Ouyang Chen’s skin was a little thick.

“He had already said so, but Ouyang Chen was still pestering him. If it were any other girl, she would probably be ashamed of herself! ”

“In order to make Ouyang Chen give up and stop pestering him, he ziteng looked at Ouyang Chen and continued, “I like everything except for people like you.” ”

“He really did not like Ouyang Chen, and he did not know where Ouyang Chen had the confidence to think that he would like her. ”

“Ouyang Chen smiled and said, “Brother, your words are a little sad!” ”

“He ziteng pinched his temple helplessly. “You can go down! I will not like you! Moreover, I have already confessed to the person I like. You will make her misunderstand.” ”

“Ouyang Chen said, “Don’t worry. If the girl you like accepts you, I’ll definitely not cause you any trouble! But now you’re still single. Since you’re single, that means I still have a chance.” ”

Ouyang Chen wasn’t the kind of person who didn’t have principles.

He ziteng frowned. “I still have a meeting to attend. You can get off first.”

“Ouyang Chen pushed the door open and got out of the car. “Then, Mr. He, I’ll See You Tomorrow.” ”

“He ziteng couldn’t be bothered with Ouyang Chen. He stepped on the accelerator, causing dust to fly everywhere. ”

Ouyang Chen looked at the back of the car as it left. Her eyes were filled with infatuation.

She didn’t know what was wrong with her.

Why did she like he ziteng so much?

Could This be the legendary fate?

“No one had ever envied Ouyang Chen in his entire life. At this moment, he was very much like the girl whose mother he ziteng had confessed to. ”

That girl must be very beautiful.

“Otherwise, why would he ziteng be so obsessed with her. ”

He ziteng drove to the place he had made an appointment with Xu Xiao.

“When he arrived, Xu Xiao had not arrived yet. ”

“About half an hour later, Xu Xiao arrived late. ”

“In fact, Xu Xiao had arrived a long time ago, but she had been hiding in the dark, quietly observing he ziteng. She wanted to see what he ziteng would do when she was not around. ”

“In the end, as she wished, he ziteng did nothing but wait for her. ”

And it could be seen that he ziteng really loved her very much.

“Before she arrived, he ziteng had been looking forward to it. ”

“When he saw her appear at the door, his gaze instantly changed! ”

That look was even more..

“”I’m sorry to have kept you waiting, Mr. He,”Xu Xiao said apologetically. ”

“”It’s alright.”He ziteng looked at Xu Xiao and said somewhat impatiently, “How is it? Xu Xiao, have you thought about it?” ”

“Xu Xiao nodded. “Mr. He, you’re really a very outstanding person, but I’ve thought about it for a long time when I went back. I feel that when I find an age, I should focus on my studies and career, so I don’t want to think about the major matters of my life for the time being.” ”

“”Shakespeare once said that all relationships that don’t aim at marriage are hooliganism. Since I don’t have any intention of starting a family and getting married now, I can’t waste your precious time.” ”
