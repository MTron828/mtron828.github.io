“”Dad! Dad! You’re not really going to let me go to jail for ten years, are you? You have to save me! Dad! You have to save me!”Chen Yaosheng almost burst into tears, just the few days in the detention center alone was already unbearable for him, let alone being locked up for another ten years? ”

What did ten years mean?

No.

He did not want to go to jail!

“Chen Jinyan continued, “If you knew this would happen, why did you do it in the first place! If you didn’t do such shameful things, how would trouble find its way to you?” ”

“”Dad, this is really not my fault. It’s all Bai Jingshu’s fault. That B * Tch Bai Jingshu seduced me! If she didn’t seduce me on her own accord, why would I do this? What kind of woman do I usually want? Dad, I beg you, please save me. I Won’t dare to do this again in the future!” ”

Chen Jinyan’s face was cold and he didn’t say anything.

“Seeing that the visiting time was almost up, Chen yaosheng cried out, “Dad! Dad! I’m your biological son. You Can’t be so heartless to me! You have to save me!” ”

“Chen Jinyan continued, “During this period of time, you should properly reform inside. Don’t stir up trouble. I’ll think of a way over here.” ”

“Hearing this, Chen Yaosheng seemed to be grasping at the last straw. “Okay, Dad. Don’t worry. I’ll definitely listen to you. You must get me out of here as soon as possible.” ”

Ding!

“The visiting time was up. The transparent glass in front of Chen Yaosheng immediately turned gray, cutting off the sight of both parties. ”

“”01456, Time’s up. Hurry up and go back.”In the detention center, the suspect didn’t even have his own name. He only had a code name. ”

Chen Yaosheng was 01456.

“Hearing his code name, Chen Yaosheng stood up from his chair and walked back. ”

“On the other side, Chen Jinyan walked out of the police station and said to his assistant, “Help me investigate an earthling.” ”

“Who?”The assistant asked.

“”Lin Ze,”Chen Jinyan answered. ”

“Since the culprit was Lin Ze, as long as they found Lin Ze and dealt with him, they would definitely be able to resolve this matter. ”

“Lin Ze?”The assistant felt that this name was somewhat familiar and was stunned. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Why do you know him?”Chen Jinyan asked.

The assistant shook his head. “I think I’ve heard of him.”

“Chen Jinyan continued, “After you find this person, immediately put him under my control.” ”

“At this point, he seemed to have thought of something and continued, “I heard that Lin Ze’s skills are pretty good. Arrange for a few more people and don’t let your guard down.” ”

“Hearing this, the assistant’s expression was a little complicated. ”

He was just an earthling. How good could he be when he stretched out his hand?

“However, the assistant did not show it. He nodded and said, “Okay.” ”

“After giving these instructions, Chen Jinyan boarded the flying machine next to him. ”

The assistant went to investigate Lin Ze.

“Lin Ze was an earthling. In the alliance, it was too easy to find information about an earthling. ”

“Initially, he thought that Lin Ze was just an ordinary earthling. However, after seeing Lin Ze’s information, the assistant’s face turned pale. ”

He immediately went to Chen Jinyan’s office. “Deputy Governor!”

“”Why are you here? Didn’t I ask you to investigate Lin Ze?”Chen Jinyan frowned slightly and continued, “Have they arrested him?” ”

“”Not yet, not yet.”The assistant gulped. ”

“Then why are you here?”

“The assistant continued, “Vice-captain, Lin Ze... may be untouchable.” ”

Untouchable?

“He was just an earthling, what was there to be untouchable about? ”

“How am I supposed to do my job?”Chen Jinyan raised his eyebrows slightly.

“”I don’t dare. It’s true that Lin Ze’s identity is a little special...”the assistant continued, “He, he is...” ”

“Can he still be the Emperor?”Chen Jinyan asked.

“Even the Emperor had to pay a price for offending his son, not to mention that Lin Ze was just an earthling. ”

“The assistant continued, “Lin Ze is Miss Ye’s older brother.” ”

“”What Miss Ye? What’s wrong with Miss Ye? Even if it’s Ye...”at this point, Chen Jinyan’s unfinished words stopped abruptly. He turned to look at the assistant. “What did you say? Whose older brother is Lin Ze?” ”

“”Miss Ye,”the assistant answered. ”

Chen Jinyan’s face turned pale.

No wonder!

No wonder!

No wonder the Bai family was so strong-willed. It turned out that they were backed by a big tree.

“Is the information reliable?”Chen Jinyan continued to ask.
