“Jamila narrowed his eyes. He knew that he had really met his match this time, he said very sincerely, “Old madam, whether you believe it or not, I still say that we have no purpose. We just want you to spend your old age peacefully and show filial piety on behalf of Professor Feng.” ”

“At this point, Jamila paused and continued, “Since you’re unwilling to go to country C, I won’t force you. This is my contact information. As long as you want, you can contact us at any time.” After saying this, Jamila placed his business card on the table. ”

The old lady was not afraid of offending others. She directly picked up the business card and threw it into the trash can in front of Jamila.

The corner of Jamila’s mouth twitched as he restrained the anger in his heart.

“With his achievements today, he had never dared to do this in front of him. However, today, he was slapped in the face by an old lady from China. This made Jamila feel very uncomfortable. However, at this moment, no matter how uncomfortable he felt, he could only endure it! ”

Nothing was more important than the national treasure of the Song dynasty.

One must never lose something because of something big or small.

“”Old Lady, Professor Feng is your only daughter. I know you are angry and very sad.”Gamila stood up and continued, “Actually, just like you, we are also very sad.” ”

“At this point, Gamila took out an envelope from her bag, “You only have one daughter, Professor Feng. Now that Professor Feng is gone, you have no one to rely on in China. This is a small gift from our professor. Although the pension is not much, it is enough for you to live in China. You must accept it.” ”

“There is no need.”The old lady raised her hand to reject him. “Having such a daughter is a failure for me as a mother! It is her karma to exchange for the death of a guest in another country! You can go. You Don’t have to come again.”

Just pretend that she had never had such a daughter.

Being rejected by the old lady several times in a row made Gamila doubt her life.

“Moreover, this time, he did not say anything else. He just left some money behind. According to normal thinking, the old lady would definitely take the money. ”

“People die for money, and birds die for food. ”

Who was not born to Love Money?

The old lady’s reaction was beyond Gamila’s expectations.

What was even more unexpected was that the old lady did not ask Feng Qi a single word from beginning to end.

“She did not ask if Feng Qi’s body would be transported back to Earth, nor did she ask about Feng Ying. ”

This was a little cold!

“”Young man,”at this moment, the old lady continued to speak, interrupting Gamila’s thoughts. ”

Gamila turned around. “Please speak.”

“”Please, you are not welcome here.”The old lady was too lazy to say anything more and directly ordered her to leave. ”

Jamila’s expression did not change and she did not feel embarrassed. “Sorry to disturb you.”

“After saying this, Jamila walked out. ”

“After taking a few steps, Jamila seemed to have thought of something and turned to look at the old lady. “I still say the same thing. As long as you want, you can contact us at any time.”After saying this, she did not have any lingering feelings. ”

The old lady was left standing alone in the room in a daze.

It was not until Jamila’s back completely disappeared from her sight that the old lady let down her guard and collapsed on the chair. Two streams of muddy tears rolled down from her eyes.

Feng Qi was her only daughter. It would be a lie to say that she was not sad at all.

But what could she do even if she was sad? Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

It had already happened!

“The old lady sobbed and said, “I’ve already said that traitors will not have a good ending. This child, she just won’t listen, just won’t Listen!” ”

Retribution!

This was all retribution!

“What evil did she do in her previous life? In this life, the heavens wanted to punish her this way. ”

“Auntie Wu looked at the old lady who was crying bitterly. The corners of her mouth curled up. In a moment, she walked forward, she pretended to comfort her, “Old Lady, I’m sorry for your loss. Don’t be sad. If you do this, Professor Feng Won’t be at ease in heaven.” ”

“Heaven?”The old lady raised her head to look at Auntie Wu. “Do you think a person like her can go to Heaven?”

“In the past, people like Feng Qi would be implicated by their entire family, let alone go to heaven! ”

“If a woman didn’t teach, her mother’s fault would also be related to her. ”

“Hearing this, Auntie Wu was stunned and didn’t know how to respond, she just said, “Madam, it has already happened. No matter how sad you are, it’s useless. An elderly person can’t have too much emotional fluctuation. It’s not good for your health.” ”

The old lady took a deep breath and sighed.

“Seeing Jamila coming out of the Feng family’s villa, Tina immediately went up to her. “How is it?” ”
