“Lin Ze said, “There’s no need. My uncle is already eating!” ”

“Father Zhao squeezed through the crack in the door. “A Ye, dad brought you food!” ”

Ye Sen looked up at Father Zhao. “I’ve said it many times. My Name Is Ye Sen! It’s not Zhao Ziye!”

“Father Zhao immediately said, “Okay, okay, okay! If you don’t like this name, then I won’t call you a Ye. It’s fine to call you sen! Come to Sen. I’ll get someone to make Pigeon Soup for you. There’s also bird’s nest here.” ”

“I’m already full.”Ye Sen put down his chopsticks.

“Facing Ye Sen, Father Zhao had no temper at all. “It’s okay, it’s okay. It’s Daddy’s fault for coming late tonight. Daddy will come early tomorrow! Don’t be angry, Sen!” ”

“Ye Sen continued, “Mr. Zhao, I won’t recognize you, and I don’t want to see you. Can you please leave?” ”

“Father Zhao wiped his eyes, he continued, “Sen, I know you hate me, and I can understand. After all, when you were young, I didn’t take care of you for even a day. It’s not that I don’t want to take care of you, but I think of you every day, every minute! “Oh right, Sen, you haven’t met your mother, right? “Your mother is a very good, kind, and gentle woman. Oh right, I have her photos here... ... ...” ”

“As he spoke, Father Zhao took out a few old photos from his pocket. ”

“Although they were very old, the photos were still well preserved. ”

The woman in the photos had bright eyes and kind eyes. One look and one could tell that she was from a well-bred family.

This was the first time ye Sen had seen his own mother.

“For some reason, his eyes were slightly red. ”

“Father Zhao immediately said, “Sen, it’s like this. Back then, there was a misunderstanding between your mother and I, so your mother brought you back to your hometown. At first, I thought that she was just going back to relax, but three days later, she still didn’t come back. Only then did I realize that something was wrong. I immediately went back to my hometown to look for the both of you, but the both of you seemed to have vanished from the face of the earth... ... .. ”

Father Zhao cried as he spoke.

“”Sen, I’m already over 70 years old today. Other people at my age would have become grandfathers long ago, but I live every day missing my son. Can you understand this feeling?” ”

“I know you hate me and blame me...”

“”Sen, what do you have to do to forgive me?”Father Zhao took out a dagger out of nowhere, “Sen, will you forgive me if I Die? If that’s the case, I’m willing to die right now! Actually, it’s good that I’m dead. I can go find your mother if I die. However, the only person I can’t Let Go Of Is You, son! Father has just reunited with you... ... .. ”

“As he said the last sentence, Father Zhao slashed the dagger at his neck. ”

He didn’t show any mercy.

There was blood immediately.

Ye Sen was shocked and quickly snatched the dagger from father Zhao’s hand. “What are you doing! ?”

“Father Zhao’s neck was still spurting blood, but he didn’t care at all. “Sen, let me die! I’m A Sinner!” ”

Because he had already planned it.

“This part wouldn’t kill anyone. At most, there would be more blood. ”

“Ye Sen looked at Lin Ze. “Ah Ze, go and find a doctor!” ”

Lin Ze nodded and ran out.

“Soon, the doctor arrived. ”

“However, Father Zhao refused to let the doctor bandage his wound. “Ah Sen, unless you can forgive father! Otherwise, father will die in front of you!” ”

“After returning, Father Zhao specially got someone to investigate ye Sen. ”

This son of his was a good person and didn’t have any good intentions.

“Therefore, Ye Sen would definitely not watch him die! ”

“Ye Sen sighed, “Can you let the Doctor Bandage Your wound first? We can talk about other things later!” ”

“”No!”Father Zhao continued, “Sen, please forgive daddy! Daddy is begging you!” ”

“As he said that, Father Zhao was about to kneel down to Ye Sen. ”

“The nurse who did not know the truth said, “Mr. Ye, please quickly agree to your father! What kind of huge matter could be more important than a person’s life! Moreover, there’s only one father. You mustn’t do anything that you’ll regret!” ”

Ye Sen took a deep breath. “Alright! I forgive you!”

“Really?”Father Zhao asked.

Ye Sen nodded.

“Father Zhao ran over and hugged ye Sen excitedly. “Sen, thank you! Thank you for forgiving Father!” ”

Excited.

He was really too excited.

“Ye Sen continued, “Bandage the wound first.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Sen nodded.

...

On the other side.

At the police station.

A few police officers were analyzing ye Sen’s case.

“A young woman stood in front of the big screen, she pointed at the picture on the screen and said, “I think the murderer shot from here. Whether it’s the angle of view or the shooting distance, this is the best location. Moreover, the murderer has a strong anti-detection ability.” ”

“Hearing this, captain Li turned the pen in his hand. “Xiao Wen, Xiao Ma, have you checked the surveillance cameras?” ”

“Xiao Wen stood up and said, “Ye Sen’s injury was around 8:23, but the surveillance cameras during this period have been deleted from the Internet.” ”

“Have you asked the technical department to repair it?”Captain Li asked.

“Xiao Wen continued, “The technical department said it might be a little difficult, and they are currently trying to repair it.” ”

“Captain Li looked at the woman standing in front of the screen. “Su Fei, continue.” ”

“Su Fei nodded. Just as she was about to say something, there was a knock on the door. ”

“”Come in,”captain Li said. ”

“The next second, the door was pushed open. ”

“Seeing the person who walked in from outside, Captain Li quickly stood up and said, “Chief Liu!” ”

Seeing chief Liu.

The others also became serious.

Chief Liu nodded. “How’s Ye Sen’s case coming along?”

“Captain Li said honestly, “There hasn’t been any progress so far.” ”

“Chief Liu continued, “I heard that you guys have encountered some technical problems. This is a computer expert sent by the higher-ups, Miss Ye. If there are any problems, you can ask Miss Ye for help.” ”

“When he heard this, Ye Zhuo walked out from behind chief Liu. “Hello, everyone. I’m Ye Zhuo.” ”

Everyone looked at Ye Zhuo. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Their gazes were all different.

This young lady seemed a little young...

Captain Li looked at ye Zhuo and felt that she was a little familiar. “You’re Ye Sen’s niece?”

Ye Zhuo nodded. “I am.”

“Captain Li continued, “I heard that Ye Sen’s surgery was also performed by you.” ”

Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Captain Li exclaimed, “Miss ye is really amazing.” ”

“”I just happen to know a little about everything,”ye Zhuo continued, “Captain Li, we’re pressed for time now. Why Don’t you bring me to the technology department to take a look first?” ”

“Captain Li nodded. “This way, please.” ”

Ye Zhuo walked forward.

“In a short while, they arrived at the technology department. ”

“When the people from the technology department saw Captain Li, they greeted him respectfully. ”

“Captain Li brought ye Zhuo to a cubicle and stopped. “Xu Yao, have the surveillance cameras been repaired?” ”

Xu Yao shook her head. “Not yet.”

“Captain Li continued, “Let me introduce you. This is the computer expert that the higher-ups specially sent to support us, Miss Ye. Let Miss Ye Try.” ”

Xu Yao stood up and was about to say something when she looked up and saw ye Zao.

Her face was filled with disbelief.

Ye Zao?

Computer expert?

Wasn’t this nonsense?
