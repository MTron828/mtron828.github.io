“In the future, she would be a rising star in the science and technology industry. ”

It would be the future of the science and technology industry.

Ye Zao was just an idiot. What could she do in the science and technology industry?

“Feng Xianxian looked at ye Zao, and the look in her eyes became more and more complacent. ”

Ye Zao would be trampled under her feet for the rest of his life.

He would be a lowly person for the rest of his life.

“Ye Zao pulled out a tissue and slowly wiped his mouth. His tone was indifferent as he said, “I didn’t participate in this technology competition.” ”

Didn’t participate?

“She probably didn’t even have the qualifications to participate, right? ”

No wonder the reputation of being a good-for-nothing spread in Yun Jing.

Old Lady Lin’s eyes were filled with anger.

“Feng Xianxian had obtained a good result in the technology competition, but her biological granddaughter didn’t even have the qualifications to participate in the competition. ”

Wasn’t this a joke?

Lin Jincheng really didn’t know what was going through his mind.

He actually treated this kind of daughter like a treasure!

Was he blind?

It seemed that the Lin family’s future glory would still depend on Feng Qianqian!

“”What About You, Ah Ze?”Old Mrs. Lin looked at Lin Ze. ”

“Lin Ze’s tone was very calm. “My ranking hasn’t been released yet.”Lin Ze was quite interested in computer programming. After hearing about this matter, he immediately signed up. ”

“Feng Xianxian asked curiously, “Wasn’t the ranking released last night? Brother Ah Ze, didn’t you see it?” ”

“With that said, how could old Lady Lin not understand? ”

“It wasn’t that the ranking hadn’t been released, but that Lin Ze hadn’t gotten the ranking at all! ”

Lin Ze was previously the top scorer in the college entrance exam!

“Ever since ye Zao returned, he had become more and more dispirited. Now, he couldn’t even compare to Feng Xianxian! ”

What a disgrace. What a disgrace.

Old Lady Lin was very angry!

“Wu Mei smiled and tried to smooth things over. “Ah Ze’s grades are so good, so he must have gotten a place. Maybe the system has a delay!” ”

“Zhang Zhenzhen smiled and said, “Yes, yes, yes! Sister-in-law is right. Something must have gone wrong with the system. Today is the family banquet. Let’s eat and not talk about these topics!” ”

Zhang Zhenzhen also smiled and agreed.

Delay?

This was not the college entrance examination results. Those with high scores were all blocked. How could there be a delay?

It was clearly Lin ze who did not have any results!

“The more old madam Lin thought about it, the more uncomfortable she felt. ”

“Since today was the family banquet, she could not say anything. ”

“Feng Xianxian scooped a bowl of soup for Old Madam Lin. “Grandma, I just tasted this soup. It tastes very good. If your teeth are not good, drinking more soup is good for your body.” ”

Madam Lin took the soup from Feng Xianxian and smiled. “Xianxian is still sensible.”

“After that, Madam Lin looked at Feng Qianhua. “Qianhua, you taught Xianxian well. If Ah Ze and ZAO can also win the third prize in the science and technology competition, I’ll be able to wake up from my dream with a smile.” ”

“Actually, this sentence was meant for Ye Shu to hear. ”

The implication was that ye Shu did not teach her two children well.

“If Lin Ze and ye Zao had crawled out of Feng Qianhua’s stomach, they would definitely be very outstanding. ”

What a pity!

Things did not go as planned.

“Feng Qianhua looked up. “Actually, I didn’t really care about Xianxian. She mainly relied on her own efforts.” ”

Feng Xianxian was naturally outstanding.

She was nothing like Lin Ze and ye Zao. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“She was born with bad conditions. No matter how hard she worked, she would never become a phoenix. ”

“Old Lady Lin smiled and said, “It’s mainly because you taught her well.” ”

“Usually, if Old Lady Lin praised Feng Qianhua, her daughters-in-law would definitely agree. ”

But now.

“Zhao shuning had left, and her three daughters-in-law were still in a heated relationship with Ye Shu. For a moment, no one spoke up. ”

“Old Madam Lin glanced at the daughters-in-law, her eyes filled with anger. ”

“These people were already grandmothers, so why didn’t they have any discerning eyes? ”

“Feng Qianhua narrowed her eyes and smiled. “Actually, Ah Ze and burning are also very outstanding. It’s just that everyone has different talents and specialties. Xianxian is just lucky.” ”

“”Aunt Lin, stop praising her. This child can’t help but praise her. If you continue to praise her, she will soon lose her way.” ”

“Now that the Lin family lacked Zhao shinning, the situation was indeed quite disadvantageous for Feng Qianhua. ”

But Feng Qianhua was not worried.

“At least, she still had Old Lady Lin to support her. ”

It seemed that she had to find a new partner for Lin Qingxuan.

After dinner.

Old Lady Lin called her daughters-in-law over. “Each of your families will send someone to attend Xianxian’s award ceremony on Saturday. Let’s go and support xianxian.”

“When she said this, the daughters-in-law felt a little awkward. ”

“If it was in the past, they would still be happy to attend Feng Xianxian’s award ceremony. ”
