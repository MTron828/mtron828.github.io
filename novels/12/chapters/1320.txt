“”Yes.”Zheng Wanyin nodded, “I didn’t know at first, but ye Zao’s actions were too obvious. Usually, the other party has no ability, no means, and has repeatedly dragged the team down. Do you think that such a person can get 3A?” ”

“”This ye Zao is simply too impudent! She doesn’t put me, her grandmother, in her eyes at all!”Xie wanqiu was so angry that her face turned pale. “A person like her wants to marry my grandson? No Way!” ”

She was simply daydreaming!

“After saying that, xie wanqiu continued, “When can I look at the assessment papers? I’ll get someone to go with you!” ”

“Zheng wanyin said, “It’ll be about two hours later.” ”

“After saying that, Zheng wanyin said, “Grandmother, don’t make a fuss for the next two hours. We’ll talk about it after we look at the assessment papers.” ”

She had to make ye Zao unable to refute her!

When the time came.

Ye Zao’s reaction would definitely be very interesting.

“Xie wanqiu looked at Zheng Wanyin. Her tone had a hint of disappointment, “You Child, how many times have I told you? You have to learn to be tougher, but you don’t listen to me! As long as you are tougher in front of Ye Zao, this little slut wouldn’t dare to step on your head and shit today!” ”

Zheng Wanyin held Xie Wanqiu’s arm. “I believe that the CEO will definitely give me justice.”

“Xie wanqiu continued, “After this matter is over, I will definitely get Shaoqing to dump her! Such a person with no morals is not worthy of my grandson!” ”

Only Zheng Wanyin was the most worthy of Cen Shaoqing.

“The two of them were not related by blood, but they could be even closer! ”

“Most importantly, Zheng Wanyin was so outstanding. ”

“At this moment, a rapid ringtone sounded in the air. ”

“Zheng Wanyin picked up the call. “Alright, I’ll be right there.” ”

“After hanging up, Xie wanqiu asked curiously, “Who is it?” ”

“Zheng wanyin said, “Someone from the notary office called me over. They probably have some information to fill out in the assessment papers. Grandma, I’ll go over first.” ”

“You go ahead.”Xie wanqiu nodded. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Bai Xiaosu was also at the notary office.

“Ever since joining ABA, ostracism and isolation had been everywhere. ”

“However, Bai Xiaosu did not expect that they would doubt his test scores. ”

“Although Bai Xiaosu had received a lot of unequal treatment in ABA, he still could not stand it. When he was filling in the information, his hands were shaking. His delicate baby face was filled with loneliness. ”

“Seeing that Bai Xiaosu couldn’t even fill in the information properly, Zheng Wanyin’s eyes were filled with ridicule. ”

How could someone like Bai Xiaosu get into Triple A! !

She didn’t know what kind of background Bai Xiaosu had to deserve the CEO’s protection.

Just thinking about it made her feel disgusted.

Zheng Wanyin had never experienced such a terrible thing in her entire life. This was the first time.

“After signing the documents, Zheng Wanyin looked at Bai Xiaosu and said, “Bai Xiaosu, I’ve never offended you before, right? Why are you doing this to me? ! I’m afraid that in this world, only someone like you can change the examination papers!” ”

“After Bai Xiaosu finished signing the last word, he looked up at Zheng Wanyin and said, “Whether you believe it or not, I’ve never done it. My results are all self-earned.” ”

“”Self-earned? Heh,”zheng wanyin sneered, “With just you?” ”

Everyone in the ABA knew Bai Xiaosu’s background.

It didn’t matter what they wanted.

“Usually, they didn’t even have any friends in the group. ”

“”In the past, I don’t know why everyone ostracized you, but now I can see it!”Zheng wanyin continued, “Who would want to be friends with a thief? Bai Xiaosu, you’re a thief! You’re not qualified to stay in the ABA!” ”

“Stealing her results, wasn’t that a thief? ”

This kind of behavior was simply despicable!

Disgusting!

“Bai Xiaosu pinched his fingers, his eyes filled with a forbearing look. “I’m not a thief.” ”

“”Not a thief?”Zheng Wanyin looked at Bai Xiaosu. “If you’re not a thief, how did you get your results?” ”

“Bai Xiaosu looked up and met Zheng Wanyin’s eyes. “I’ll say it again, I’m not a thief!” ”

“Zheng Wanyin sneered, “How many thieves have you seen that would admit to being a thief? “Bai Xiaosu, if you admit to it now, I can still plead with the chief executive to let you off the hook. If it really gets to the point where you have to check the examination papers, then you won’t be the only one who will lose face!” ”

Cheating had a very high impact. It would directly affect the immediate family members.

“”If you haven’t done it, then you haven’t done it.”After saying this, Bai Xiaosu walked towards the exit. ”

Zheng Wanyin looked at her back and narrowed her eyes.
