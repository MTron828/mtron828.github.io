“In addition to the good climate in the east continent, there were bushes and towering trees everywhere. It was normal for a little girl like ye Zao to get lost.”

“Everyone was already tired from climbing the mountain, and now they had to look for ye Zao.”

This made Lu Qi of the blue team very unhappy.

“It was undeniable that ye Zao’s performance in the first episode was indeed good, but she could not be arrogant and look down on anyone.”

This was the mountain.

“On the mountain, she should follow everyone.”

What was she doing acting alone?

Was it to show that she was very good?

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “Yezi is so good, she definitely won’t get lost. Let’s Wait a little longer. Maybe Yezi will be back soon.””

“Lu Qi continued, “Chenyu is right. Let’s Wait a little longer. Yezi should be back soon. I don’t think Yezi is the kind of person who doesn’t have a sense of time.””

“At this moment, footsteps appeared in the air.”

“Yin Wei looked back and said in surprise, “Yezi!””

“Wei Wei.”

“Yin Wei continued, “Yezi, where did you go?””

“Ye Zao said, “I saw some wild lotus mist over there, so I went to pick some.””

“Only then did Yin Wei see that ye Zao was holding a bag in his hand. “Yezi, don’t tell me that this bag of yours is filled with Lotus Mist?””

“Ye Zao nodded slightly. “It’s Lotus Mist. Try it and see how delicious it is. At this time of year, the Lotus Mist has just ripened, and there’s a lot of moisture in it.”” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Yin Wei tried a mouthful of Lotus Mist. It was indeed not very tasty. It was sweet and refreshing. It was many times more delicious than what she had bought in the supermarket.

Ye Zao then took the Lotus Mist and distributed it to the others.

“Everyone was tired and thirsty from climbing the mountain. Now that ye Zao had brought the Lotus Mist, it just happened to solve the urgent problem at hand.”

The director ate two of them in one go.

Ye Zao took a big bag full of them. Everyone present could get a share.

“”Ye, you’re really amazing. How did you find the Lotus Mist in the mountain?”Chang Yu asked.”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “The climate in the East continent is good. When we went up the mountain, I saw many wild fruits nearby, so when you were resting, I went around and found a fruit tree covered in lotus mist. Thinking that you must be thirsty, I picked some more.””

Chang Yu gave ye Zao a thumbs up.

“For a moment, the topic and the camera turned back to ye Zao. Even the other members of the program team were praising ye Zao.”

Song Chenyu frowned.

Ye Zao was too outstanding.

This was completely different from what she had imagined.

“She thought that she could crush ye Zao on the show, but she didn’t expect that not only did she fail to crush ye Zao, but she also let ye Zao get all the limelight.”

No.

She could not let things continue like this.

“If this continued, ye Zao would really have to enter the entertainment industry.”

“Ye Zao had yet to enter the entertainment industry, and the haters were already trying to smear her. Once ye Zao entered the entertainment industry, would she still have a say in the entertainment industry?”

She had to think of a way to end this once and for all.

“Thinking of this, song Chenyu narrowed his eyes.”

“After eating the Lotus Mist, the group continued on their journey.”

Song Chenyu and song yiwan walked together. The two of them chatted as they walked.

“Song yiwan said, “Chenyu, I heard that you have a new drama to broadcast in the next few days. Your acting skills are so good. The new drama will definitely be popular.”Song Chenyu was a popular female star and had won many awards. However, she was just a little lacking in popularity, if the new drama became popular this time, song Chenyu’s status in the entertainment industry would rise to another level.”

“When that time came, she would be an existence that needed to be looked up to!”

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “Who am I? After our last episode ended, the heat was all on Miss Ye. Do you believe that after this episode is broadcast, she will definitely become popular again?””

Let’s not talk about anything else.

“Just take today’s Lotus Mist incident as an example. If it was put on the show, it would be another big attraction.”

“A look of disdain flashed across song Yiwan’s eyes. She continued, “No matter how popular she is, she’s just an internet celebrity. She can’t be compared to You!”Song Yiwan Despised Ye Zao from the bottom of her heart.”

So what if ye Zao did well?

An internet celebrity was an internet celebrity!

An internet celebrity could never be compared to a celebrity.

“Song Chenyu looked at song yiwan, “Yiwan, you’re wrong! The times are different now. No matter if Miss Ye is a celebrity or an internet celebrity, as long as there are people who like her, she can debut! Moreover, Miss Ye is so outstanding. Her fans on the wonderful sound platform are almost over 100 million. Can’t you see? Right now, the camera crew is basically revolving around her. She’s the heat of the show. Compared to her, who am I?””
