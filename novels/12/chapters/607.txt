“Other than Feng Qianhua, her daughters-in-law had never been so respectful to her before.”

Jiang Suran scooped up a bowl of soup and handed it to Old Lady Lin. “It’s a little hot. Let Me Blow on it for you.”

“Old Lady Lin smiled and said, “Alright, I’ll have to trouble you.””

“Jiang Suran said, “It’s no trouble. It’s also my blessing to be able to serve you.””

Old Mrs. Lin liked what she heard.

“The more she heard, the more she felt that Jiang Su ran was a good girl who knew the cold and the hot.”

Wasn’t Lin Qingxuan lacking someone like that by her side?

Jiang Su ran bragged for a long time before handing the soup to Old Mrs. Lin. “Try it. Is it still hot?”

“Old Mrs. Lin took the soup and took a sip. She smiled and said, “It’s not hot anymore.””

“After drinking the soup, Jiang Su ran picked up a piece of tissue to wipe old Mrs. Lin’s mouth. The service was very considerate.”

“If Old Lady Lin was just a little satisfied with Jiang Su ran, she would be very satisfied now. She smiled and asked, “Su ran, how are your parents’health now?””

“Jiang su ran said, “My parents have already retreated to the front line. They are still in good health. They usually walk the dog at home and listen to the show.””

Old Lady Lin nodded. “How many brothers and sisters do you have?”

“Jiang Suran replied, “I’m the second eldest at home. I have an elder brother above me and a younger sister below me.””

“So they have a family?”

“”Yes.”Jiang Suran continued, “My nephew is 21 years old this year and my niece is 13 years old this year.””

“”So, you’re the only one in your family who has no family now?””

“Yes.”

Feng Qianhua looked over and the corners of her mouth curled up. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

She knew Old Lady Lin very well.

“Seeing Old Lady Lin like this, she knew that this matter was almost certain.”

“If Old Lady Lin was not satisfied with Jiang Su ran, she would have chased her out long ago. She did not have the time to ask so many questions here.”

It was not until three in the afternoon that Feng Qianhua left with Jiang Su ran.

Old Lady Lin personally sent the two of them to the car. She also told Jiang Su ran to come over often when she was free.

They got in the car.

“Jiang Su ran looked at Feng Qianhua and asked nervously, “Qianhua, what do you think of Old Mrs. Lin’s impression of me?””

“Feng Qianhua smiled and said, “You did very well. Don’t worry, I’m Still Here!””

“After hearing Feng Qianhua’s words, Jiang Su ran felt much more at ease. “Qianhua, I’ll have to trouble you with this matter.””

“Of course.”Feng Qianhua patted the back of Jiang Su ran’s hand.

“Jiang Suran seemed to have suddenly thought of something. “By the way, why didn’t I see the Lin family’s fourth son today?””

“Feng Qianhua said, “He probably went out. I’m not too sure either.””

Jiang Suran frowned. “Then what if the Lin family’s old lady has her eyes on me and the Lin family’s fourth son doesn’t agree?”

“After all, the person she was going to marry was Lin Qingxuan, not Old Lady Lin.”

Feng Qianhua smiled. “The person in charge of the Lin family is Old Lady Lin. You’re just worrying over nothing!”

“As long as Old Lady Lin agreed, would Lin Qingxuan Dare to say anything?”

“Even if Lin Qingxuan had any objections, he would probably be angry but not dare to say anything. if he dared to resist, he wouldn’t have married Zhao shuning twenty-one years ago.”

“Is that so?”Jiang Suran was a little worried.

“Feng Qianhua nodded. “The fourth son of the Lin family has soft ears. When Old Lady Lin told him to go east, he didn’t dare to go west. When he was with Zhao shuning previously, the person in charge was always Zhao shuning.””

“Jiang suran smiled and said, “Actually, I’ve heard about this too! Speaking of which, that Zhao Shuning is quite capable. He actually pushed the infertility onto the fourth son of the Lin Family! “He even made the Lin family’s fourth elder take the blame for so many years!””

“If it was anyone else, they probably wouldn’t have the ability to do so.”

Feng Qianhua only smiled and didn’t say anything.

“Actually, in her opinion, Zhao shuning was still stupid.”

“In fact, as long as Zhao shuning used a little trick, even if everyone in the Lin family knew that she was the one who was infertile, Lin Qingxuan would still feel guilty towards her for the rest of her life.”

Unfortunately.

Zhao shuning hadn’t thought of that at all.

“In a short while, the car arrived at the entrance of the Jiang family home.”

Jiang su ran smiled and invited Feng Qianhua to her house to have a cup of tea.

“Feng Qianhua said, “There are plenty of opportunities to have tea. I still have other matters to attend to today, so I’ll go back first.””

Jiang su ran nodded. “Then you go ahead.”

Feng Qianhua instructed the driver to start the car.

Jiang Su ran waited until the car was out of sight before she turned around and walked towards the Jiang family home.

“As soon as she walked in, the Jiang family’s old madam walked out. “You’re back? How did it feel to go to the Lin family home today?””

“Jiang su ran brushed her hair behind her ear. “The Lin family’s old madam has a very good impression of me. Furthermore, Qianhua is the matchmaker. I feel that this matter will definitely not make a difference.””
