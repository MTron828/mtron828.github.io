“Her roommate, who had just returned from eating outside, screamed in shock when she saw this scene. ”

“Soon, the campus was filled with the sound of sirens. ”

“When Old Mrs. Lin heard the news, it was already the next morning. ”

“She held Feng Xianxian’s last letter, which had been sent from the capital, and cried uncontrollably. She looked up at the police officer and asked, “Is the child okay now?” ”

Old Madam Lin was a little regretful now. She had never dreamed that Feng Xianxian would use suicide to make up for her mistakes.

She should not have been so heartless yesterday.

“If something had really happened to Feng Xianxian, then she would also be blamed! ”

This child was really too stupid!

How could she not understand why she would commit suicide?

This matter was all Feng Qianhua’s fault. What had it got to do with Feng Xianxian?

“Feng Qianqian was just like her, a pitiful victim. ”

Old Madam Lin could even understand Feng Qianqian’s feelings now.

Feng Qianqian’s current mood was probably the same as Lin Jin city’s family of four not forgiving her.

Why should she and a child bear the responsibility for what Feng Qianhua had done?

She was innocent!

The child was also innocent! 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

A nobody had nothing to do with it!

“The police officer looked at Old Madam Lin. “Because it was discovered too late, the situation was rather critical. The injured person is still in the ICU.” ”

Old Madam Lin closed her eyes. “Is Xianxian also in this hospital?”

The police officer nodded.

“Old Madam Lin got down from the bed and went to the ICU to see Feng Xianxian. However, because Feng Xianxian was still in danger, she could not be seen for the time being. ”

Old Mrs. Lin could only ask the nurse about Feng Xianxian’s condition through the door.

“The nurse said, “Are you the family member of the injured person?” ”

Old Mrs. Lin nodded. “Yes! I Am!”

“Then please go to the first-floor payment center first and pay the medical fees for the injured person!”

Old Mrs. Lin was stunned.

Could it be that the Feng family had not shown up since Feng Xianxian’s accident?

Old Lady Lin quickly made a call and asked someone to pay for Feng Xianxian.

It was not until three in the afternoon that Feng Xianxian was transferred out of the intensive care unit.

“Upon hearing this news, Old Lady Lin quickly went to Feng Xianxian’s ward. ”

“When Old Lady Lin arrived, Feng Xianxian was still unconscious in front of everyone. Old Lady Lin sat in front of the bed for a while before Feng Xianxian slowly woke up. When she saw Old Lady Lin, she revealed a blank expression. “Grandma, Grandma?” ”

“Xianxian! You’re awake!”Old Lady Lin Cried Tears of joy.

“Feng Xianxian looked at Old Lady Lin. “I, am I not already dead? Grandma, could it be that you’re also...” ”

“Silly child! You’re not dead! You’re not dead at all! You’re Fine!”

“When she heard this, Feng Xianxian turned her head. “Why did you save me! I’m a sinner, I deserve to die...” ”

“”No! You’re not a sinner! Xianxian, Grandma’s reaction was too extreme! This is all your mother’s fault, it has nothing to do with it. In the future, you’ll still be Grandma’s good granddaughter!” ”

“Feng Xianxian burst into tears, but her eyes were filled with pride. ”

She had won this bet!

“Although she had walked out from the gates of Hell, it was worth it! ”

“After making Feng Qianxian cry like this, Old Lady Lin couldn’t help but hug her and cry together. ”

“She was just like Feng Qianxian, a pitiful person that no one could understand. ”

“After a long while, Feng Qianxian finally stopped crying. “Grandma, I’m sorry, I’m really sorry! Thank you for forgiving me...” ”

“”Silly child! Grandma was also angry yesterday. Grandma didn’t know that you would take it to heart! Promise Grandma that you won’t do this in the future, Okay?” ”

Feng Xianxian nodded. “Okay.”

“Old Lady Lin Wiped Feng Xianxian’s tears. “Alright Silly Child, don’t cry anymore. If you cry again, it won’t look good.” ”

“Feng Xianxian broke into a smile and wiped Old Lady Lin’s tears as well. “Then Grandma, Don’t Cry Anymore.” ”

“”Okay, let’s not cry anymore.” ”

“Feng xianxian continued, “Oh right, Grandma, Are You Alright? What did the Doctor Say?”Feng Xianxian had just woken up and she was already concerned about her health. Old Lady Lin was very touched. ”

“After all, Feng Xianxian herself was an injured person. ”

“Old Lady Lin was afraid that Feng Xianxian would be worried if she told her the truth, so she simply said, “It’s nothing. The Doctor said that she’ll be fine after staying in the hospital for a few days.” ”

“Feng Xianxian nodded, she continued, “Grandma, actually, receiving treatment in the hospital is far less reassuring than our own people. I remember that Sister Ye Zao’s medical skills are very good. She even cured master Yu’s illness. Why Don’t you get Sister Ye Zao to take a look at you?” ”

Ye Zao?

“At the mention of Ye Zao, a gloomy look flashed across Old Lady Lin’s eyes. ”
