“You’re back. You’re in the bedroom!”Sun Fuhai said.

“Auntie sun continued, “Did you boil the soup?””

“Yes.”Sun Fuhai nodded. “It’s in the pot!”

Auntie Sun hung her bag on the wall. “I’ll go and bring the soup to Jiayi.”

“”You should rest first.”Sun Fuhai smiled and said, “I’ll go in a while.””

“I’m not tired.”

Auntie Sun came to the kitchen and scooped out the soup. She carried it to Sun Jiayi’s room.

“Sun Jiayi was playing games. When he saw Auntie Sun come in, he looked up and said, “Mom, you’re off work.””

“”Yes, I’m off work.”Auntie Sun nodded. “Are you playing games?””

Sun Jiayi acknowledged.

Auntie Sun handed the soup over. “I’ll play later. Have a sip of the soup first.”

“Put it there.”Sun Jiayi’s face was full of impatience.

“Auntie sun said, “The soup will be cold later. Drink it while it’s hot.””

“At this moment, the hero that Sun Jiayi controlled was killed by the enemy.”

“Sun Jiayi looked at Auntie sun and said unhappily, “Mom, it’s all your fault! They’re playing the game! What are you doing here? You’re so annoying!””

“”I’m sorry, I’m sorry. It’s all mom’s fault. Drink the Soup First!””

Sun Jiayi took the bowl and cleaned the soup inside.

“Only then was Auntie Sun satisfied. She smiled and said, “After this round, we’ll come out to eat.””

“Got it.”Sun Jiayi rolled her eyes. “Aren’t you annoying!”

Auntie Sun walked out of Sun Jiayi’s bedroom.

Sun Fuhai had already placed the dishes on the table. “Where’s Jiayi?”

“Inside.”

Sun Fuhai sighed. “This child only knows how to play games all day. What should we do in the future!”

“”What are girls afraid of?”Auntie sun continued, “As long as she marries into a good family, she can enjoy a good life in the future!””

She was not a boy. She had to earn money to marry a wife and also support her family.

The girl was the one who was supported.

“Sun Fuhai nodded and said, “That’s true.””

“Auntie Sun sat down to eat. “I must find a good family for Jiayi! Let Jiayi become a rich lady.”She had already been like this for her entire life, she could not start all over again. She could not let her daughter follow in her footsteps. She could not allow her daughter to be subservient and work for others.”

“Thinking of this, Auntie Sun narrowed her eyes.”

Auntie Sun returned to the villa to work.

The Butler gave Auntie Sun a big bag of Chinese medicine.

“Auntie Sun was stunned for a moment before she continued, “This is Madam’s medicine?””

“In order to successfully conceive a child, Xia Xiaoman had been taking medicine to recuperate her body.”

“The butler said, “It’s the medicine that Mr. and Mrs. Sun took together. From now on, we have to boil it every morning and evening and bring it upstairs.””

“Auntie Sun worked seriously and was very careful. Brewing medicine was not a small matter, so the Butler was not at ease leaving it to others.”

“In addition, Xia Xiaoman trusted Auntie Sun More, so it was most suitable for auntie sun to handle this matter.”

“Men also take it?”Auntie Sun was stunned when she heard that Lin Qingxuan also wanted to eat it together.

“”Yes.”The butler continued, “Quickly go and boil the medicine. Mr. and Mrs. will be up in a while.””

Auntie Sun nodded. “I know. I’ll go and boil the medicine now.”

It was five o’clock in the morning. Xia Xiaoman and Lin Qingxuan usually went out at seven thirty in the morning. Two hours was just enough to boil the medicine.

“”Okay.”The butler continued, “Remember to be more careful with Mr. and Mrs.’s medicine.””

“”Don’t worry, housekeeper. I know.””

“An hour and a half later, Auntie Sun brought the medicine to the dining room.”

“Lin Qingxuan had already finished eating and was ready to leave. When he saw Auntie Sun bring the medicine over, he turned to look at Xia Xiaoman. “Are you going to start eating today?””

Xia Xiaoman took a bite of the steamed bun. “Eat early to see the effect.”

“Lin Qingxuan nodded, picked up the medicine, gritted her teeth, and drank it in one gulp.”

“Auntie Sun quickly handed him a candied fruit. “Sir, it won’t be bitter if you eat a candied fruit.””

“”No need.”Lin Qingxuan waved his hand repeatedly. “Xiaoman, I’ll be leaving first. I’ll pick you up at the company tonight.””

“”Okay, take care on the road.””

“Seeing Lin Qingxuan’s figure disappear outside the door, Xia Xiaoman sat back in her chair and sighed softly.”

“She had taken so much medicine, but there was no movement.”

“Auntie Sun saw Xia Xiaoman’s sadness and said, “Madam, this child’s fate is fated. There are many times when you can’t help but worry. Just let nature take its course.””

“Xia Xiaoman nodded and turned to look at Auntie Sun. “Auntie Sun, how many children do you have?””

“At the mention of this, Auntie Sun’s eyes dimmed. “There was originally a son and a daughter. When my son was 10 years old, he fell into the lake during his summer vacation and drowned. Now there’s only one daughter left.””

“”I’m sorry.”Accidentally mentioning Auntie Sun’s sad story, Xia Xiaoman felt a little guilty.”
