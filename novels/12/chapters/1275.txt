Ye Zao took the photo. “No problem.”

Old Merchant’s face lit up. “How long will it take?”

“”About ten minutes.”Ye Zao continued, “Which computer can I use?” ”

“Old merchant quickly said, “This one, this one, this one is my computer.” ”

Ye Zhuo sat in front of the computer.

“Old merchant continued, “Xiao Wang, go and get Miss ye a glass of water.” ”

“”Okay,”Xiao Wang replied. ”

Xiao Wang went to the pantry to get some water. The Pantry was already in a heated discussion.

“”Have you heard? The higher-ups specially sent a computer expert. In less than 20 minutes, the surveillance that the technical department could not recover was restored!” ”

“I also heard that Xu Yao’s face turned green from anger!”

“”Serves her right! A person like her deserves to be slapped in the face like this. Otherwise, she would really think that she’s the most powerful person in this world!” ”

“”You’re talking about Miss Ye, right? I was in the technology team just now. Not only is miss ye powerful, she’s also very good-looking! She’s like a celestial being descending to the mortal world!” ”

“Really?”

“Of course! I saw it with my own eyes!”

Xiaowang gulped as he poured the water and listened to everyone’s conversation.

“The miss ye that they were talking about couldn’t be the Miss ye that was sitting in group a right now, right? ”

“Just now, she thought that Miss Ye was a relative of old merchant. ”

She didn’t expect that this miss ye’s background was actually so great!

She was simply too amazing!

“In a moment, Xiaowang carried the water back to Group A and placed the cup beside Ye Zhuo. “Miss Ye, drink some water.” ”

“After knowing ye Zao’s identity, Little Wang stood beside ye Zao and even his breathing became more careful. ”

“Thank you.”Ye Zao picked up the cup and drank some water.

Little Wang looked at ye Zao very carefully.

She was indeed beautiful.

“Other than being beautiful, she also looked somewhat familiar. ”

“However, Little Wang could not remember where he had seen her before. ”

“Time passed by minute by minute. In the blink of an eye, ten minutes had passed. ”

“Ye Zhuo let go of the mouse. “Team leader Jia, the photo has been fixed.” ”

Team leader Jia immediately walked over.

A complete group photo was displayed on the computer screen.

The facial features of the person were very clear.

“”Aiya, Miss Ye! You’ve really helped us a lot!”Old Jia bowed to Ye Zhuo. “On behalf of the victims’families, I thank you!” ”

“”It was nothing.”Ye Zao’s expression was still the same, “Oh right, I installed a simple repair software on your computer. Next time, you can just use the software to repair it directly. I’ve already written down the steps of the Operation Group in My Notebook.” ”

“”Thank you so much!”Old merchant continued, “Where did you download that software? I asked the other police officers to download it too! This way, it’s much more convenient when handling cases!” ”

“Ye Zhuo said, “I just made the software on the spot, so I might not be able to download it.” ”

“Old merchant said in surprise, “You mean, not only did you fix the photos, but you also made a software.” ”

“Ye Zhuo’s eyes were indifferent. “Actually, I only made a software. I can just use the software to create the photos with one click.” ”

Old Merchant:”...”he said it as if it was very simple.

He did not understand the world of big shots!

“Xiao Wang, who was beside him, was also stunned! ”

“When they came out of the police station, Snowflakes had unknowingly started to drift outside. ”

“Captain Li chased after them from inside. “Miss Ye, let me send you back!” ”

“”Thank you, but I drove here.” ”

“Captain Li revealed a regretful expression and continued, “Then, Miss Ye, you have to be careful on the road.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“”I haven’t thanked you yet,”captain Li continued. ”

“You’re welcome.”Ye Zhuo’s red lips parted slightly. “Ye Sen is also my uncle.”

“Therefore, she was not only helping captain Li, but also helping herself. ”

“On the way back, the snow was getting heavier. ”

“”Roasting sweet potatoes, selling roasted sweet potatoes...” ”

“When they passed the traffic light, Ye Zhuo saw an old lady selling roasted sweet potatoes with an iron stove. ”

“The old lady was very old, and her clothes were not very good. ”

There were even patches on her clothes.

“Ye Zhuo pulled over, opened the door, and walked to the old lady’s side. “Grandma, how much is a baked sweet potato?” ”

“The old lady raised her head to look at Ye Zhuo. “Young lady, regardless of whether you buy the root or weigh it in catties, it’s five yuan per catty.” ”

“Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and continued, “How much do you have left? I want all of it.” ”

Take all of them?

“The old lady had been selling roasted sweet potatoes for three days and this was the first time she had met such a generous customer. Although she was a little happy.., however, she still said, “Little girl, roasted sweet potatoes are not durable. They won’t taste good if they get cold. You just need to buy one.”She knew that ye Zaoyi was not buying roasted sweet potatoes. It was only because of her old age.., she wanted to help her. ”Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com
