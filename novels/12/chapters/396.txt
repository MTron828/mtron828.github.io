“Chapter 397: 116: a forceful slap to the face, a secret exposed. So Old Lady Cen is fifth Cen’s grandmother! 7”

Translator: 549690339

“The sudden decline of her family and the loss of what was rightfully hers by Ye Zao, Mu Yourong’s heart was already burning with anger. ”

She had met another blind old woman!

It was just the right time to vent the evil fire in her heart.

“Who are you scolding? How dare you be so arrogant after bumping into someone! Scum!”

The reason why Mu Yourong dared to be so arrogant was precisely because she knew Old Lady Cen’s background.

The CEN family had already declined!

Could it be that there was still someone who could stand up for Old Lady Cen?

“”Damn old woman, say that again!”Damn old woman, she actually dared to call her a scumbag! ”

“At this moment, Old Lady Cen suddenly sat down on the ground. She hugged Mu Yourong’s leg with one hand and refused to let her leave. With the other hand, she began to take out her cell phone from her pocket to call the police, “She hit someone! She hit someone! Police uncle, quickly come over! Someone is bullying the elderly here!” ”

“Mu Yourong did not expect Old Madam Cen to suddenly act like this. She was so anxious that her face turned white. “Damn old woman, what are you talking about? Who Hit You?” ”

“The police were patrolling nearby. After receiving the call, they immediately rushed over. ”

“Seeing the police coming over, Old Madam Cen was like seeing her savior, she complained with Snot and tears, “Police Uncle, you’re finally here! If you still don’t come, I’ll be beaten to death by her! Police uncle, you have to stand up for me!” ”

“Mu Yourong was so angry that she wanted to directly tear old Madam Cen apart. She hurriedly explained, “Acting! This old woman is acting. She wants to blackmail me! She’s cheating! Police comrade, don’t believe her!” ”

Damn Old Woman! She was really too shameless!

She actually dared to extort her like this!

“”Don’t worry, we police won’t wrongly accuse a good person, and we won’t let a bad person off either.” ”

There were no surveillance cameras at the scene of the incident.

“There were also no witnesses, so the police had no choice but to bring the two back to the police station. ”

“Old Madam Cen insisted that Mu Yourong had beaten her, “Police uncle, didn’t she say that I was extorting her? I don’t want her to compensate me. I just want her to have a proper attitude and apologize to me. As for the rest of the matter, you can handle it however you want!” ”

The two police officers looked at each other.

They both felt that Old Lady Cen’s request was not excessive.

“If the old lady really wanted to extort money, she would not be so easy to talk to. ”

Mu Yourong did not want to apologize to Old Lady Cen.

She wanted her to apologize to this wretched old lady?

On what basis?

“But at that moment, she only had the choice of apologizing. ”

Because the MU family was no longer the MU family of the past.

“So, she could only apologize to old Mrs. Cen with a cold face. “I’m Sorry!” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen was so ‘scared’that she hid behind the police officer, “Police uncle, I’m scared of her like this! Do you think she’ll take revenge on me when she gets out? I’m just a weak little girl, what should I do when the time comes? Police uncle, you have to make a decision for me...” ”

The police officer looked at Mu Yourong angrily. “Have a proper attitude! Detain her for three days and apologize to the old lady. You Choose!”

“Mu Yourong was about to explode from anger. She could only take a deep breath and try her best to calm herself down. “Old Lady, I’m really sorry. It’s all my fault. Please forgive me!” ”

“Only then was old Madam Cen satisfied. She waved her hand and said, “Forget it, forget it. We beautiful people won’t stoop to the level of those who are ugly!” ”

Ugly?

This damn old woman actually said that she was ugly!

Mu Yourong was so angry that she gritted her teeth!

“After saying this, old madam Cen turned to look at the police officer behind her and said apologetically, “Police uncle, I’ve caused you trouble today!” ”

Look at how polite the old man was!

“”It’s fine, it’s fine, old man. In the future, if anyone dares to bully you again, you can just call the police.” ”

“”Alright, thank you, police uncle.” ”

Old Madam Cen signed the document and walked out of the police station with a smile on her face.

Mu Yourong walked in front of old Madam Cen.

“Just as she walked out of the police station, she saw a slender figure walk in. ”

He was dressed in an old-fashioned long gown and held a string of Buddhist beads in his hand. The sunlight cast a faint halo on his brows.

This is...

CEN fifth master?

Why did CEN fifth master come?

Mu Yourong’s breathing stopped.

Could it be...

CEN fifth master came for her? Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Yes!

It must be like this!

CEN fifth master must have come for her.

“Otherwise, why would he suddenly appear at the police station? ”

“Thinking of this, Mu Yourong was extremely excited. ”

Her heart almost jumped out of her chest.

She knew that fifth master Cen loved her.

“Knowing that she had encountered some trouble, Cen Shaoqing could not wait to come to the police station to avenge her! ”

This damned old woman was dead for sure!

Mu Yourong was extremely happy. She just stood there and waited for Cen Shaoqing to come and find her.

“Seeing that Cen Shaoqing was getting closer and closer to her, Mu Yourong was extremely excited. ”

Bang Bang Bang —

“Five...”

The remaining ‘grandfather’word was stuck in Mu Yourong’s throat because Cen Shaoqing had passed her and walked straight inside.

What was inside?

Why did Cen Shaoqing act as if he did not see her?

“At this moment, Mu Yourong was a little flustered. ”

She turned around and looked behind her.

“She saw Cen Shaoqing walk straight to old Madam Cen’s side and stop. “Grandmother, are you alright? Are You Hurt Anywhere?” ”

Old Lady Cen Smiled. “I was just bitten by a mad dog. Don’t worry.”

Grandmother? !

Boom!

Something exploded in Mu Yourong’s mind.

“Mu Yourong’s blood instantly flowed backwards. Her face was deathly pale, and she stumbled back a few steps. ”
