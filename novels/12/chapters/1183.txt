“Okay! I’ll Go Now!”The Butler immediately ran out.

Father Zhao turned to look at Zhao Xueyin again. “Go upstairs quickly.”

“Okay.”Zhao Xueyin nodded and walked upstairs.

“Soon, the butler came over with some people. ”

The person was about thirty years old.

He was dressed in a suit and a pair of glasses.

“Although master five rarely appeared in public, his assistant, Lin Zhaoyang, often appeared in public. ”

“That’s right, this was Lin Zhaoyang! ”

“Master Five’s chief special assistant, Lin Zhaoyang! ”

“Father Zhao immediately went up to welcome him. “Special Assistant Lin, you have graced my humble abode with your presence!”Although Lin Zhaoyang was only a special assistant, he was Master Five’s special assistant. In the entire financial world, there were countless people who wanted to curry favor with Lin Zhaoyang, there were countless of them. ”

“Lin Zhaoyang smiled and said, “Elder Zhao, I can’t accept your words!” ”

“”I can accept it! Special Assistant Lin is young and promising, how can I not accept it?”Father Zhao said as he asked a servant to pour tea. ”

The servant quickly made tea.

“Lin Zhaoyang took a sip of tea and looked up at Father Zhao. “Elder Zhao, is Miss Zhao at Home?” ”

He wanted to see Zhao Xueyin before he could finish his sentence.

It seemed that this fifth master was quite satisfied with Zhao Xueyin.

“”Yes.”Father Zhao nodded. “Special Assistant Lin, if you want to see her, I’ll get someone to call her over immediately.” ”

“Then I’ll have to trouble elder Zhao.”

Father Zhao turned to look at the maid. “Go and call Miss Zhao over.”

“Okay.”The maid turned and went upstairs to call for someone.

About five minutes later.

“Zhao Xueyin followed the servant downstairs. “Dad, you called for me?” ”

“Father Zhao stood up and said, “Let me introduce you. This is special assistant Lin. Special Assistant Lin, this is my daughter, Zhao Xueyin.” ”

“”Hello, Miss Zhao.” ”

Zhao Xueyin nodded. “Special Assistant Lin.”

Lin Zhaoyang then took out a crystal bracelet from his pocket. “Is this Miss Zhao’s?”

Zhao Xueyin narrowed her eyes. She did not know what Lin Zhaoyang was trying to say. “I do have an identical bracelet.”

“Lin Zhaoyang continued, “Did Miss Zhao go to Treasure Elephant Square three days ago?” ”

“Yes.”Zhao Xueyin nodded.

She did go to Treasure Elephant Square three days ago. Could it be that..? ... Fifth Master was also there?

“Thinking of this, Zhao Xueyin’s heart beat a little faster. ”

“Lin Zhaoyang smiled and said, “Then Miss Zhao’s bracelet must be gone. I found this bracelet three days ago in Treasure Elephant Square. Now it’s returned to its owner.” ”

“After saying that, Lin Zhaoyang placed the bracelet on the table. ”

The light purple bracelet reflected a faint light under the light.

“Zhao Xueyin said in surprise, “If it wasn’t for special assistant Lin personally making a trip, I wouldn’t have known that I lost my bracelet! Thank you, Special Assistant Lin.” ”

“”You’re welcome. It’s my pleasure.”Lin Zhaoyang stood up from the chair. “Since the item has been delivered, I’ll be leaving first.” ”

“Father Zhao stood up as well. “Special Assistant Lin, do you want to sit for a while?” ”

Lin Zhaoyang looked at his watch. “Next time. I still have official business today.”

“Official business is more important!”Father Zhao nodded and stood up to send assistant Lin off. “Then I won’t keep you any longer.”

Zhao Xueyin followed behind Father Zhao to send Lin Zhaoyang off.

“Father and daughter sent Lin Zhaoyang out of the door. Seeing the black car disappear on the road, Father Zhao turned to look at Zhao Xueyin. “Xueyin, what does assistant LIN mean by this?” ”

The Honorable Chief Special Assistant of Master Five came all the way here just to give Zhao Xueyin a bracelet?

“What do you think?”Zhao Xueyin asked back.

“After that, Zhao Xueyin continued, “Dad, I don’t even have such a bracelet. What do you think master five means?” ”

Anyone with a discerning eye could see it.

“Master Five wanted to give her a gift, but he could not bring himself to say it out loud. He could only use the excuse of losing something to get his assistant to bring it over. ”

“After all, the fifth master was not an ordinary person. ”

His way of doing things was also not quite the same as an ordinary person.

“Father Zhao narrowed his eyes and said in a strange manner, “But Special Assistant Lin never mentioned the fifth master from the beginning to the end.”He had a feeling that this matter was not that simple. ”

“Zhao Xueyin walked into the house, picked up the bracelet, and slowly put it on her wrist. “Dad, just wait for the fifth master to call you Lord Tai Shan!” ”

“In the past, Zhao Xueyin was still a little nervous. Did master five really like her. ”

“Now, Zhao Xueyin was not nervous at all. ”

“If master five did not have her in his heart, would he ask someone to send the bracelet over? ”

Of course not!

Jiang Financial Group.

The Jiang Financial Group was on the right track overnight. The happiest person was none other than Jiang Xiaoyu.

“”Dad, didn’t you not believe in Great Scorch before? How is it? Are you satisfied now?” ”

“Just the day before yesterday, Jiang Chao was still scratching his head anxiously. He had even planned where the Jiang family would move to after the Jiang Financial Group declared bankruptcy. ”

Who would have thought.

“After waking up, the situation had completely changed! ”

It was only now that Jiang Chao understood why ye Scorch was not anxious in the beginning.

It wasn’t a coincidence that the Jiang Financial Group was in such a situation.

It was because there were too many pests!

Ye Zao was also taking the opportunity to clean up the mess.

“I’m convinced! How can I not be convinced?”Jiang Chao nodded repeatedly. He was simply too convinced!

Ye Zao’s methods were too clean and efficient.

It could be said that he killed without spilling any blood.

“Even Jiang Chao, an old veteran in the financial world, was full of admiration! ”

“Jiang Xiaoyu smiled and said, “I already said that burning scorch is very powerful, right?” ”

“What do you call President Ye?”Jiang Chao turned to look at Jiang Xiaoyu. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Burning Scorch!”Jiang Xiaoyu answered.

Jiang Chao raised his hand and slapped Jiang Xiaoyu. “How can you be so rude! Can you just call President Ye by his name?”

Jiang Xiaoyu rubbed his head and felt a little wronged. “Burning Scorch made me call him that!”

“Stop calling me that!”Jiang Chao slapped Jiang Xiaoyu again.

Jiang Xiaoyu immediately changed his words. “It was President Ye who made me call you that.”

“Jiang Chao said, “That was President Ye’s polite words to you! Don’t be so rude in the future!”Ye Zhuo saving the Jiang Financial Group was equivalent to saving the entire Jiang family! ”

Ye Zhuo was now the savior of the entire Jiang family.

“Got it.”Jiang Xiaoyu nodded.

“Jiang Chao sighed, “President Ye saved our family. If president ye encounters any difficulties in the future, Xiaoyu, you must be responsible and bear the brunt! You must know how to be grateful!” ”

“”Don’t worry! Big,”at this point, jiang Xiaoyu immediately changed his words, “President Ye is so powerful. No matter what difficulties she encounters, she will be able to solve them easily!”In Jiang Xiaoyu’s eyes, Ye Zao was simply omnipotent. There was no problem that ye Zao couldn’t solve. ”

“Just remember what I said.”Jiang Chao glanced at Jiang Xiaoyu.

“Jiang Xiaoyu nodded. “Okay, dad, I got it!” ”

On the other side.

At the Jin family home.

“Old Master Jin held his phone and stood in front of the window. “Special Assistant Lin, how is it? is everything going smoothly?” ”
