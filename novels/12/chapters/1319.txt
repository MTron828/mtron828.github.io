“”Jing Jing, this... This isn’t good, right?”Zheng wanyin said guiltily, “This is my own matter. How can I implicate all of you!””

“Liu Jing looked at Zheng Wanyin, “Wanyin! This is no longer a matter for you alone. It’s a matter for all of us. If there’s one, there’ll be two! When that time comes, the atmosphere will be ruined by this group of people. We won’t need to take the assessment anymore. We can just directly get someone to look for connections!””

“Zheng Wanyin hugged Liu Jingjing. “Jingjing, thank you.””

“”Wanyin, we are friends. There’s no need to be so polite.”Liu Jingjing patted Zheng Wanyin on the back and continued, “By the way, do you know who switched the assessment papers between you and Bai Xiaosu?””

“Zheng Wanyin nodded. “There are suspicious people, but I haven’t seen the assessment papers yet. I Can’t jump to a conclusion.””

“Who is it?”Liu Jing asked.

“Zheng Wanyin looked around and said in a low voice, “I told you, you can’t tell anyone.””

“Liu Jing nodded. “Don’t worry, I Promise I won’t tell anyone.””

“Zheng wanyin said, “Our main assessment officer.””

Main Assessment Officer?

A devastatingly beautiful face immediately appeared in front of Liu Jing’s eyes.

“Miss Ye?”

Zheng Wanyin nodded. “It’s her.”

“Liu Jingjing frowned slightly. “I saw how good-looking she was and how nice she was. I really didn’t expect her to do such a disgusting thing! But it’s normal when you think about it. After all, you can’t judge a book by its cover.””

“”Maybe she doesn’t like me,”Zheng Wanyin said.”

“Doesn’t like you? Why wouldn’t she like you?”Liu Jingjing asked.

“Zheng wanyin continued, “She, she is my cousin’s girlfriend.””

“Hearing this, Liu Jing’s face was filled with shock. “That means, the two of you are related?””

Zheng Wanyin nodded.

“”The relationship between relatives is still like this!”Liu Jing was a little speechless as he said, “This is the first time I’ve seen such a Weirdo!””

Other people were relatives for the sake of their relatives.

“When it was Miss Ye’s turn, it became slander and framing.”

“Zheng Wan Yin sighed. “Jing Jing, don’t tell anyone about this. After all, she is my cousin’s girlfriend. It Won’t be good for us to see each other.””

“”Don’t worry.”Liu Jing nodded and said, “But I still have to say it. Your Cousin’s girlfriend is really weird! If word gets out, I’m afraid no one will believe it!””

“Zheng wanyin continued, “Oh right, my grandmother is still waiting for me outside. I’ll go and see my grandmother first.””

“”Go.”Liu Jingjing said, “I’ll go and organize everyone too. When the time comes, I’ll go and get justice for you.””

“Sorry to trouble you.”

“It’s my pleasure.”

Zheng wanyin came to the family waiting area.

“Xie wanqiu was already looking forward to it. When she saw Zheng Wanyin’s voice, she smiled and came up to her. “How is it, yinyin! Did you get in?””

“”I’m sorry, Grandma. I’ve disappointed you.”Zheng Wanyin’s expression was as if she was about to cry.”

Xie Wanqiu’s heart skipped a beat. “What’s going on? Tell Grandma. Grandma will make the decision for you!”

“Zheng wanyin continued, “I got 1a.””

“”1A? How is that possible!”Xie wanqiu continued, “I clearly told ye Zhuo to keep 3A for you! Oh! I know. She did it on purpose! She’s jealous of you. She Can’t stand to see you well!””

“Without even thinking about it, she knew that ye Zhuo must have done it on purpose.”

“Zheng Wanyin was such an outstanding person, how could she not even get 3a.”

“”Ye Zhuo that little b * tch, she really thinks that she’s amazing just because she’s the main examiner!”Xie wanqiu held Zheng Wanyin’s hand, “Go! yinyin, Grandma will make the decision for you!””

“”Grandma, don’t be so agitated. Ye Zhuo is cousin’s girlfriend after all. Before this matter gets to the bottom of it, it’s better for us not to make a fuss!””

What kind of person was Cen Shaoqing?

He was extremely protective.

Zheng Wanyin had seen it with her own eyes. Someone had flirted with CEN yueying with words. Cen Shaoqing rushed over and beat that person half to death.

At that time.

Cen Shaoqing was only 12 years old.

“Without any evidence, if Xie wanqiu tried to reason with Cen Shaoqing, Cen Shaoqing would not admit it.”

“Not only would he not admit it, he would even feel that they had wronged ye Zao.”

“Then what do you think we should do?”Xie wanqiu could not stand Zheng Wanyin being wronged.

She had to seek justice for Zheng Wanyin immediately. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Zheng wanyin continued, “I have already applied to the CEO to look at the assessment papers for me and another examiner. When that time comes, the truth will be revealed.””

Xie wanqiu frowned. “Ye Zao Changed Your Assessment Papers?”
