“Chapter 2048: 426: Ye Zao appearing in the election, Qiu Di and the others were dumbfounded! 5”

Translator: 549690339

The chief was a little embarrassed.

“He originally thought that everyone would gladly accept Qiu Di. After all, Qiu Di was personally chosen by Ye Zao. ”

Who knew that everyone would actually not pay the bill at all.

He hoped that Qiu di would be able to easily deal with these people and not disappoint ye Zao’s expectations.

“In an instant, the beaded curtain behind the rostrum slowly rose and a figure appeared behind the beaded curtain. ”

“Qiu Di wore a bright phoenix robe, and on her head was a glittering crown. She was graceful and graceful, walking step by step in the middle of the red carpet. ”

She had a myriad of noble auras.

“But this noble aura was a fake noble aura, and it all came from the Phoenix Robe on her body. If she didn’t have that Phoenix Robe, she would be an ordinary person who couldn’t be found even if she fell into the crowd. ”

“When they saw this phoenix robe, everyone was discussing animatedly. ”

“Phoenix Robe! It’s a phoenix robe! How did Miss Ye’s phoenix robe appear on her body? !” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Could it be that she stole it?”

“”Even if she wore a dragon robe, she wouldn’t look like the Crown Prince!” ”

“She wants to replace Miss Ye’s position? She’s overestimating herself!”

“...”

Everyone’s discussion fell into autumn flute’s ears word for word.

Autumn flute didn’t feel awkward at all.

The corners of her lips curled up.

“Just wait and see. How much they looked down on her today, how much they would regret it in the future! ”

“Although autumn flute was very proud in her heart, she didn’t show it on her face at all. Autumn flute walked all the way to the rostrum, bowed to everyone, and then said, “Hello Everyone, I am autumn flute. Autumn in autumn, flute in music.” ”

“After saying that, no one gave any reply. ”

There was only very scattered applause.

“”The master is wandering, the clown is in the Hall!”Someone threw a smoke bomb, but it was blocked by the defense system. “Hurry up and get off the stage! You’re embarrassing yourself!” ”

“Autumn flute maintained his smile, then he said, “I know that everyone doesn’t recognize me now and have doubts about me. Actually, to tell you the truth, a few months ago, I was just like everyone else. I was extremely unconfident in myself. I didn’t even understand why Miss Ye would hand everything over to me! “I’m afraid that I’ll let Miss Ye Down, and I’m even more afraid that I won’t receive everyone’s approval. If I hadn’t been prepared, Qiu Di might not have had the courage to step onto this rostrum today.” ”

“At this point, Qiu Di’s eyes turned slightly red. ”

Her words had two meanings.

“The first meaning was not that she wanted to sit on the position of the female monarch, but that she was entrusted by Ye Zhuo. She was just being entrusted by someone to be loyal. ”

The second layer of meaning was that she was only a girl. How could she have the guts to cheat? Why did everyone have to make things difficult for a girl like her? It was more or less an unfair victory.

“When these words were said, everyone’s discussion became a little quieter. ”

“Bai changhu continued, “Miss Qiu Di, right? May I ask what evidence do you have to prove that miss ye has indeed given the position of successor to you?” ”

“Qiu Di looked at everyone with slightly red eyes. “Old Mister Bai thinks that if I did not obtain Miss Ye’s approval, how do you think I put on this Phoenix Robe? I believe that all of you are not unfamiliar with this phoenix robe, right?” ”

“With these words, Bai changhu finally noticed the phoenix robe on Qiu Di and narrowed his eyes, he continued, “According to what you mean, as long as I can wear this phoenix robe, I can ascend to the position of female sovereign? Miss Qiu Di, Don’t you think that your words are ridiculous?” ”

“Bai changhu paused at this point and continued, “Regardless of the origin of this phoenix robe, whoever wore it, it’s just a dead object! Unless you can make it speak and admit it personally.” ”

“”Elder Bai is right. Let the Phoenix Robe Speak!”Someone below the stage said, “Who knows if your Phoenix Robe was stolen!” ”

“”Right, right, right! I think it’s most likely stolen!” ”

“Hearing this, autumn flute’s eyes turned even redder. She looked at the crowd and continued to speak, “Please rest assured, everyone. Although autumn flute is not the daughter of a big family, she knows how to write the words ‘etiquette, justice, integrity, and Shame’! I can use my personality to guarantee that the Phoenix Robe was definitely not stolen!” ”

“”Personality?”A mocking laugh came from the crowd. “For a person like you, do you still have a personality?” ”

“Do you know what a personality is?”

“Hurry up and take off what belongs to Miss Ye.”

“Thief!”

The situation became more and more intense.

“Fortunately, all of this was within Qiu Di’s expectations. She had long known that this group of people would definitely turn into demons. ”

“The corners of Qiu Di’s mouth curled up into a self-deprecating smile, she continued, “Actually, I’m not surprised at all by everyone’s attitude. When Miss ye entrusted this heavy responsibility to me, I told her that the words of the Qiu di people were light, and that I’m afraid they wouldn’t be able to convince the masses. But Miss ye told me that everything depends on human actions. No one is born to be strong. Everything is difficult at the beginning. “Actually, I shouldn’t have cried today. I should have been happy. I should have been happy that after Miss Ye left this world, there was still such a group of people who missed her. I thank you all on behalf of Miss Ye.” ”
