“Chapter 2055: 427: Phoenix Nirvana, returning from the fire of Desire! 5”

Translator: 549690339

The death penalty was the death penalty.

“There were very few criminals in changyue who were sentenced to death. Once they were sentenced to death, they would commit a serious crime. It was as if the death was extremely tragic and inhumane. ”

He couldn’t die!

He couldn’t die!

“The sixth clan leader never thought that things would turn out like this, he shouted, “I’m innocent! I’m Innocent! She’s not Miss Ye! Miss Ye died a long time ago, Miss Ye is already dead! Everyone, believe me! She’s a liar! Everyone, don’t be deceived by her!” ”

“However, everyone present acted as if they did not hear what the six clan leaders said. ”

“Ye Zao turned his gaze unhurriedly towards Qiu Di. Before he could say anything, Qiu di had already collapsed to the ground. ”

The six clan leaders had been sentenced to death. Her ending would definitely not be too good.

“However, she was still so young! ”

“After a moment, ye Zao’s red lips opened slightly, “Qiu Di, Qiu Chang Town, and the remaining members of the Qiu clan have colluded with the Great Witch Doctor. They collaborated from the inside and outside to kill the Emperor and master. They caused an experimental accident, causing the deaths of more than twenty people. They were sentenced to death!” ”

“Qiu Changzhen, Qiu Di, and the Qiu family’s gang were also controlled by the guards. ”

All the strength in Qiu Changzhen’s body was not taken away in that instant.

“He had originally hoped that Qiu di would be able to let the Qiu family take the national surname, and from then on, bring glory to their ancestors... ”

He had never thought that...

What should he do now?

The members of the Qiu family repeatedly cried out their grievances.

“Qiu Di’s eyes were lifeless. Compared to the arrogant look he had a few days ago, he was like a completely different person, allowing the guards to drag him around. ”

“The Great Witch Doctor saw that the situation was not right, so she quietly stood up and walked out of the door. ”

It was never too late for a gentleman to take revenge.

“Although he had lost this battle, he still had plenty of opportunities in the future! ”

Ye Zhuo’s insight was extremely strong. He had to leave this place as soon as possible before she noticed anything unusual.

Pa..

“Right at this moment, a bullet shot out from the barrel of the gun. It was dyed with a terrifying chill as it flew over at lightning speed. ”

“In the next second, the bullet directly penetrated the great witch doctor’s leg. ”

Bang.

“Before the great witch doctor could react, his left leg instinctively knelt on the ground. ”

Everyone looked in the direction of the Great Witch Doctor.

“Because the great witch doctor had disguised himself as another person, everyone did not understand what ye Zao meant. ”

“At this moment, ye Zao continued, “Xiao Lin, the show has not ended yet. Why are you in such a hurry to Leave?” ”

Xiao Lin was the great witch doctor’s name.

“Hearing this, the Great Witch Doctor raised his head to look at ye Zao, pretending to not understand. “Miss Ye, you’ve got the wrong person. I’m Dugu Cheng.” ”

“”Is that so?”Ye Zao turned the gun in his hand. In the next second, a bullet quickly flew towards the Great Witch Doctor’s face. By the time the Great Witch Doctor reacted, he was already too late to dodge. He was shocked, ye Zao’s skills had actually improved so much in just a few short months! Where had she gone during this period of time? ” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“In the next second, the bullet directly brushed past the Great Witch Doctor’s face, leaving a bloody scar on the Great Witch Doctor’s face. At the same time, a human skin mask fell to the ground, revealing the great witch doctor’s original appearance. ”

“So it really is the Great Witch Doctor!”

“Miss Ye is so amazing! She discovered this traitor at a glance!”

“That’s right! How Can Miss Ye Not Be Amazing?”

“...”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “The Great Witch Doctor, Xiao Lin, is to be executed!” ”

Executed.

Executed!

“The Great Witch Doctor was so sorrowful that he laughed. How could he have imagined that after scheming for so long, he would actually get these two words in return. ”

“”Ye Zao, I lost! But I refuse to accept it!”The Great Witch Doctor looked at Ye Zao, his gaze filled with malice. “Ye Zao, you were clearly already dead!” ”

He refused to accept it!

He really refused to accept it!

How did a person who had already died come back to life?

The Great Witch Doctor still could not understand this logic!

“Unfortunately, the great witch doctor did not receive this answer because he was dragged away by the guards. It was as if he was dragging a dead dog. There was no dignity to speak of. ”

“”Miss Ye, Congratulations. The Phoenix has risen from the Ashes, and the fire of desire has returned.”The secretary general stood up and walked to ye Zao’s side, extending his right hand to ye Zao. ”

“Using the words ‘The Phoenix has risen from the Ashes, and the fire of desire has returned’to describe the current ye Zao could not be more appropriate. ”

“”Thank you, Secretary General Fan.”Ye Zao shook his hand. ”

“”You’re welcome.”Secretary General Fan Li looked at Zhao Dan and continued, “Madam, haven’t you been regretting not being able to see Miss Ye’s elegant demeanor? This is Miss Ye.” ”

“Ye Zhuo turned his eyes slightly and opened his red lips slightly. “Hello, Madam. I’m Ye Zhuo.” ”

Zhao Dan looked at Ye Zhuo and was slightly stunned.

This... This Is Ye Zhuo?

Why did she have the illusion that this girl was very familiar?

Something exploded in Zhao Dan’s mind with a bang.
