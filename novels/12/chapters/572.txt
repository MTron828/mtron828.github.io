“”I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I didn’t do it on purpose! Sir, are you alright?” ”

“Lin Qingxuan raised her head and saw that the person who bumped into her was a woman in her thirties. She was wearing a Chanel suit and was dressed very exquisitely. Her brows and eyes were delicate and her facial features were not too outstanding, but her eyes were especially lively. ”

“Lin Qingxuan was about to say that she was fine, but she remembered what Zhao shuning said. She took the thing that Zhao shuning handed her and shook her head to show that she was fine. Then, she put out the cigarette and walked toward the hospital. ”

“”Mom, are you okay?”An eighteen or nineteen-year-old girl ran toward them. ”

“”Lizi.”Xia Xiaoman turned her head to look at an Lizi who was running toward them and said with a smile, “I’m fine.” ”

“An lizi continued, “Then let’s go in quickly.” ”

The mother and daughter walked towards the hospital.

“Xia Xiaoman smiled and said, “Actually, mom is really fine. It’s just a little cough. There’s no need for her to come to the hospital.” ”

“”A cough is not a small matter.”An Lizi hugged Xia Xiaoman’s arm. “If you’re not feeling well, you should come to the hospital in time. Don’t drag a small illness into a big one!” ”

“She had already lost her father. For the rest of her life, she could not let anything happen to her mother. ”

“Lin Qingxuan came back from outside in less than five minutes, which surprised Lin Jincheng. “Fourth brother, why are you back so soon?” ”

“I suddenly don’t feel like smoking again.”

Lin Jincheng nodded and did not ask any more questions.

Time passed by minute by minute.

“Soon, an hour had passed. ”

“Lin Jincheng looked at his watch. “Fourth brother, it’s time. Let’s go to Doctor Zhou’s place.” ”

“Lin Qingxuan gulped and suddenly felt a little nervous. “Jincheng, why don’t you go? I’ll wait for you here.” ”

“”Let’s go together.”Lin Jincheng pulled Lin Qingxuan to stand up. “No matter what the outcome is, Let’s face it together.” ”

Lin Qingxuan took a deep breath and nodded.

The two of them came to Doctor Zhou’s office.

“When they saw Lin Jincheng and Lin Qingxuan stand up, they said, “Chief Lin, Mr. Lin, sorry to have kept you waiting! Please take a seat.” ”

Lin Qingxuan was so nervous that she did not know what to say. Her palms were covered in a layer of sweat.

“Lin Jincheng said, “Doctor Zhou, has the result of my fourth brother’s examination been released?” ”

Doctor Zhou nodded and took out a report and handed it to the two of them.

Lin Qingxuan did not have the courage to accept it.

He was afraid of facing a report of infertility. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Lin Jincheng took the report from Doctor Zhou with both hands.

“Actually, at this moment, Lin Jincheng was also a little nervous. ”

He hoped that the results of the examination would show that Lin Qingxuan was normal.

He hoped that Lin Qingxuan would be able to live for him for the rest of her life.

“What was going on now? She was afraid of Zhao shuning, so why did she slap him so frequently? ”

Lin Jincheng opened the report with trembling hands.

He flipped through the pages.

His eyes were filled with disbelief.

“Although Lin Jincheng didn’t study medicine and couldn’t understand professional terms, he could understand the six words at the bottom right corner of every page of the report. ”

The test results were normal.

Normal!

“Lin Jincheng’s heart was beating faster and faster. With only one page left, he took a deep breath and flipped to the next page. ”

The test results were normal!

“At this moment, Lin Jincheng could not hide his beating heart. ”

“”Jin, Jincheng?”Lin Qingxuan looked at Lin Jincheng and his heart was in his throat. ”

“Although he was prepared that he could not have children, at this moment, Lin Qingxuan was still very nervous and afraid. ”

“Lin Jincheng hugged Lin Qingxuan and almost choked out, “Fourth brother!” ”

“Seeing Lin Jincheng like this, Lin Qingxuan let out a breath and comforted Lin Jincheng, “Jincheng, you don’t have to do this. Actually, I already know the result.” ”

He already knew that it was him who was unable to give birth.

“Lin Jincheng misunderstood Lin Qingxuan and hurriedly said, “Fourth brother! You’re normal! The person who can’t give birth is Zhao shuning. It has nothing to do with you!” ”

At this moment.

Lin Qingxuan thought he was hearing things.

What was Lin Jincheng saying?

He said he was normal?

He was really normal?

“”Fourth brother, quickly read the report!”Lin Jincheng stuffed the report into Lin Qingxuan’s hands. ”

Lin Qingxuan’s face was expressionless as he flipped through the report page by page. His expression changed from disbelief to shock and finally to joy...

“At this moment, Lin Qingxuan could not hear anything. ”

There were only two words in his mind.

Normal!

He was a normal person!

He had the ability to give birth!

It was not that he could not.

“Doctor Zhou stood up at the right time. “Chief Lin, Mr. Lin, Congratulations to the two of you.” ”

“”Thank you, Doctor Zhou.”Lin Jincheng also stood up. ”
