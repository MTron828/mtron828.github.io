Translator: 549690339

“[ the person above is right. Dr. YC should have run away long ago! Otherwise, why hasn’t there been any news about the aircraft carrier project? ]”

“[ according to the Chinese people, it’s normal for YC to run away. ]”

“[ fortunately, she signed the bet agreement. Otherwise, wouldn’t she have run away for Nothing? ]”

“[ there is a saying in China, ‘If you can run away, you can’t run away. Don’t worry, even if YC runs away, the CEN family base will pay for it. ]”

“[ screenshot JPG ] these were YC’s bold words two years ago! At that time, she said that she would definitely develop an aircraft carrier that could surpass the speed of light! She did not expect to be slapped in the face so quickly! hahahaha! ]”

[ waiting for the aircraft carrier to take off! ]

[ we still have to land on the eight planets! What did YC say before? They want to land on Neptune to realize the freedom of diamonds for all people. Why didn’t they come out and say it now? ]

[ I’m waiting to buy a diamond at a dollar each! ]

“[ I thought YC would really be able to lead the humans to the eight planets? After all this time, they have all run away! ]”

“[ it’s normal that they have run away. Under such circumstances, if YC did not run away, would he have to wait for people to scold him and pay for it? ]? [ but, to be honest, YC really makes me look down on him. He runs away whenever he has something to do. He doesn’t have any responsibilities. He really gives the Chinese a lot of face! ]”

“[ haha, Yes, he really gives the Chinese a lot of face! ]” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

[ I was still waiting to see an aircraft carrier that can surpass the speed of light! I didn’t expect that he would run away! ]

“[@yc,@nehulu family,@chinese research base,@cen family base, why didn’t anyone come out to explain? ]”

[ aren’t you guys usually quite active? Why are you all cowering like turtles at such a critical time? ]

[ is there a need to ask? You want to pretend to be deaf and not admit your debt! ]

“[ after signing the bet agreement in black and white, can huaxia still go back on their word? ]”

“[ picture JPG ] the bet agreement is here! It clearly states that on may 18th, an aircraft carrier launch ceremony will be held at the center of Huaxia Base. There will be leaders from ten countries participating. At that time, there will be a global live broadcast. This is the live broadcast address, take it! ]”

“[ thank you for the link, Boss! ]”

“[ thank you, Boss! ]”

[ the live broadcast will definitely be very exciting. ]

[ will the live broadcast room be full? ]

“[ definitely! Brothers, remember to record the video. ]”

[ the aircraft carrier plan is obviously going to end in failure. Don’t you think it’s unnecessary to hold the launch ceremony? ]

“[ what the person above said is wrong. If we don’t hold the launch ceremony, we can hold the failure ceremony! We also have to announce a bet agreement. If we don’t hold the ceremony, who knows if China will cheat? ]”

“[ hahahaha, the person above is right. This aircraft carrier launch ceremony should be changed to a failure ceremony. ]”

[ see you on the 18th of May. ]

The entire international copyright was related to the aircraft carrier.

“Tang Xue slowly browsed the website, the corners of her mouth slightly curling up.”

“Although two years had passed, the reaction of the people was far more intense than she had imagined. Not only did the people not forget about this matter, they were even more enthusiastic.”

Just wait and see.

Ye Zhuo was about to receive his retribution.

And that B * Tch Tang Mi.

Tang Xue narrowed her eyes as a sinister light flashed in her eyes.

“”Miss Tang.”At this moment, there was a knock on the door.”

“Come in.”Tang Xue came to her senses. She closed the international website and looked up.

“The assistant walked in from outside and said, “Miss Tang, Miss Ye has sent someone to urge you to send the analysis report to her.””

“Got it.”Tang Xue nodded.

“The assistant looked at Tang Xue and hesitated for a moment before adding, “Miss Tang, you’d better send it now. Miss ye seems to be in a hurry.””

What was there to rush.

Tang Xue snorted in her heart. Ye Zao was like a clay bodhisattva who couldn’t even protect himself. How could he still have the face to rush her?

Didn’t she know that she was about to be nailed to the pillar of shame of the scientific research world?

“If she were ye Zhuo, she would have found a hole to hide in by now. How could she still have the face to embarrass herself here!”

“However, thinking about it, it made sense.”

“If ye Zhuo had known shame and dignity, he would not have said that he would build an aircraft carrier that was faster than the speed of light.”

Cen Shaoqing was also a smart and muddle-headed person. To think that he would actually fall for someone like Ye Zhuo!

“I’ve already sent it over.”Tang Xue sent over the analysis report.

“The assistant said, “Alright, Miss Tang. If there’s nothing else, I’ll be leaving first.””

“You go ahead.”Tang Xue waved her hand.

The assistant walked out of the door.

Tang Xue continued to browse through the international news.

“On the international section, there were more and more topics regarding aircraft carriers. In a short while, they occupied the entire front page.”
