Professor Feng sent Cen Jiang Out of the office.

“After Cen Jiang left, Professor Feng immediately closed the office door and took photos of the analysis report of the volcanic crystal with her mobile phone. ”

“After taking photos, she immediately sent a message to director Ma and arranged to meet him at the same place after work. ”

Director Ma was also very excited.

“With the analysis report of the volcano crystal, they could immediately emigrate to country C and study the plan to land in Europe! ”

Didn’t Ye Zao Look Down on their plan to land in Europe?

He must make ye Zao Regret It!

Ye Zao missed the precious resources on Europe and let country C land in Europe ahead of time. She would definitely regret it.

“At the thought of this, director Ma’s eyes lit up. ”

On the other side.

At the hospital.

“Gu dening returned to the ward. Gu dexin asked curiously, “How was the Blind Date?” ” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“”That’s it.”GU dening continued, “By the way, Sister has something to tell you.” ”

“Go ahead.”

“Gu dening sat by the bed and continued, “Do you know who introduced me to Chujie? She’s actually Miss Ye’s mother!” ”

“”So, she’s also ye Sen’s sister?”Gu Dexin asked. ”

“Yes.”Gu dening nodded.

“Does ye Sen Know About This?”Gu Dexin asked immediately.

“GU dening continued, “He didn’t know at first. Later, he came to the coffee shop with a client to discuss a collaboration and happened to run into us.” ”

“Gu Dexin didn’t expect things to turn out so exciting. She asked immediately, “How did he react?” ”

“Nothing.”Gu dening picked up an apple. “We sat down and had a cup of coffee together.”

Gu dexin frowned slightly.

“If ye Sen liked gu dening, he would be very angry when he saw gu dening going on a blind date with someone else. ”

But now...

Ye Sen didn’t react at all.

Gu Dexin felt that her judgment of people wouldn’t be wrong. Ye Sen had gu dening in his heart.

“But now, Gu Dexin said that ye Sen didn’t have any reaction, which made gu dexin doubt herself. ”

“”Are you mistaken?”GU dexin continued, “How could ye Sen not have any reaction at all?” ”

“Gu dexin said, “Then how would I know?” ”

“Then did he say anything?”Gu Dexin was slow in matters of love. Gu Dexin was afraid that she would miss something.

“He didn’t say anything. He just said a few words to Chu Jie.”

“What did he say?”Gu Dexin asked.

“Gu dening thought for a while and said, “Didn’t Chu Jie have a girlfriend before? Why did he go on a blind date again?” ”

“Hearing that, Gu Dexin’s eyes lit up. “He’s jealous! He must be jealous!” ”

“Gu dening looked at Gu Dexin speechlessly. “SIS, what are you thinking about?” ”

Why was he jealous?

What did this have to do with being jealous?

“Gu dexin continued, “Let me ask you again. What’s your impression of Chu Jie? Can you marry him?” ”

“”SIS, I’ve only met him once, and that’s what you’re asking!” ”

“Gu dexin said, “I’m asking you what your first feeling is like! Haven’t you heard of the Word ‘lifelong’? Just like me and your brother-in-law. When I first met your brother-in-law, I felt that your brother-in-law was someone I could entrust my life to! Reality proved that my choice was right! So, one must believe in one’s first feeling.” ”

Gu Dexin was indeed very happy in her life.

The couple was loving and had an excellent son.

“Apart from her husband who was busy with work, she had no other regrets. ”

“After saying that, gu dexin continued, “Do you have the urge to get married from Chu Jie’s first feelings?” ”

“No.”Gu dening shook her head.

“Gu dexin frowned slightly. “It doesn’t matter if you don’t. Actually, I still feel that Ye Sen is more suitable for you. Unfortunately, Ye Sen hasn’t been enlightened. Dening, let me ask you a question.” ”

“You ask.”

“GU dexin continued, “If ye Sen were your marriage partner, would you reject him?” ”

“”Sister, what are you talking about! Don’t worry about my personal problems. I know what to do!” ”

“Seeing that gu dening had such a big reaction, Gu Dexin knew what to do. ”

Not to mention other things.

The two sisters’personalities were quite similar.

“Gu dexin smiled and said, “I’m not worried! But my parents are worried. Just now, my parents called to show concern for you. They hope that you can bring a son-in-law home for them during the New Year!” ”

“Gu dening was an old woman. Her mother had only given birth to her when she was 43 years old. Now, her parents were in their 70s! ”
