“Li da long said, “I was in a bad mood and unknowingly walked to your place.” ”

“What’s the matter?”Fan Juan asked.

Li Da Long opened the car door and got out. “Let’s talk as we walk.”

The two of them walked along Wutong Avenue as they talked.

“Hearing this, fan Juan immediately said, “Is it because of my existence that Hanghang suddenly made this decision?” ” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“”This matter has nothing to do with you.”Li dalong continued, “I can tell that hang hang wants to leave me.” ”

“Fan Juan continued, “I think hang hang is quite sensible. Why would he suddenly ask to leave?” ”

“WHO KNOWS!”Li Dalong scratched his head.

“Fan Juan held Li Dalong’s hand and continued, “Don’t be anxious. Go back and talk to hang hang properly. Or maybe there’s some misunderstanding.” ”

“Okay.”

“Fan Juan continued, “Right, why did you and Hang Hang Ma get divorced? Actually, sometimes it’s normal for a child to want to be with his mother. After all, his mother was the one who was pregnant for ten months.” ”

“As a woman, Fan Juan could understand Zhou Cuihua’s feelings. ”

“The bond between a mother, daughter, or a mother and son could only be understood after becoming a mother. ”

“At the mention of this matter, Li Dalong sighed. “Her mother had an affair.” ”

“An Affair?”Fan Juan was very shocked.

“Li Dalong nodded. “How could a person with a moral blemish teach his daughter well! Besides, she left home with nothing. Other than dragging hang hang down, what else could she give hang hang hang?” ”

This was also the reason why Li Dalong strongly opposed Li hang following Zhou cuihua.

“Fan Juan continued, “Did your ex-wife find a better one? is that why she thought of taking hang hang over?” ”

“”That’s absolutely impossible!”Li dalong continued, “With Zhou Cuihua’s condition, what right does she have to find a better one? Even if she did find a better one, how could the man accept Hang?” ”

How could a man accept a daughter who was not related to him by blood?

Unless that man had gone crazy.

“Speaking up to this point, Li da long paused before continuing, “And I believe that Hang Hang is not that kind of person.” ”

Li Da Long would rather believe that Li hang really could not bear to part with Zhou cuihua than believe that Li Hang did not want him as a father because of a powerful person.

He did not believe it!

“Fan Juan smiled and said, “Don’t be in such a hurry to get angry. This is just my guess.” ”

Li Dalong did not say anything.

“Fan Juan continued, “Actually, I think you can talk to your ex-wife. She definitely knows what’s going on.” ”

“I have nothing to say to her.”Li Dalong directly rejected this suggestion.

“”You’re just too stubborn.”Fan Juan continued, “Since the two of you have already walked down the path of divorce, it means that everything in the past has been written off. You shouldn’t avoid her anymore.” ”

“Li Dalong pinched his temples. “What you said makes sense, but I’m still unable to convince myself to face her.” ”

“The moment he saw Zhou Cuihua’s face, he couldn’t help but want to tear it apart! ”

“Fan Juan smiled and said, “You’ll get used to this kind of thing slowly. Don’t worry.” ”

“Okay.”

“Fan Juan continued, “Actually, I was the same as you in the past. I was unable to face my ex-husband after a long period of divorce. Later on, I slowly came to a realization. The past is already in the past. Since I’ve already decided to start a new life, there’s no need to be stuck in the past.” ”

Fan Juan’s past was much scarier than Li Dalong’s.

“She could still dream about the past in her dreams now. Every time she woke up, she would be drenched in sweat. ”

“Hearing fan Juan’s indifferent tone of voice recounting the past, Li Dalong’s heart ached endlessly. He held onto fan Juan’s hand tightly. ”

“”Don’t worry, there won’t be such a thing in the future.” ”

“”En.”Fan Juan nodded and continued, “So you have to bravely walk out of that matter. Don’t think too much about it.” ”

“”En, I’ll listen to you.”Li Da long nodded. ”

Over here.

Li Hang also told Zhou Cui Hua about this matter.

“When Zhou Cui Hua heard about this matter, she was extremely angry. “Why doesn’t he let you follow me! Li Da Long is really good!” ”

“Li hang said, “Mom, what should we do now? Why Don’t we just forget about this matter...” ”

“”Forget about it! You’re my daughter! The daughter that I carried for ten months!”Zhou Cuihua was very strong. She continued, “Call him out tomorrow! I’ll tell him directly!” ”

“Call who out?”Li Hang was stunned.

“Li Dalong!”Zhou cuihua said.
