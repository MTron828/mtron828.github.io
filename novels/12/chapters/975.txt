“The staff brought the mother and daughter to a clean small room, “She is there. She came to our place on the night of the 16th. She doesn’t have an ID card or a cell phone on her. Her consciousness is also somewhat unclear. She doesn’t know who she is or where her family lives. From her behavior, she should have been wandering for quite a long time.””

“A woman in a black coat sat on the bed in the room. Her expression was dull, but her facial features were beautiful.”

“Perhaps because she had been wandering for too long, the surface of the black coat had condensed into a layer of dirt.”

Yang Jiao and Xi Weiyue looked at each other.

“Xi Weiyue narrowed her eyes and walked over quickly. She hugged the woman and said in a low voice, “Sister Half Moon, I’ve finally found you! Sister Half Moon!””

“The woman had not showered for many days and the smell on her body was very unpleasant, but Xi Weiyue still held it in.”

“The person in front of her, whether it was his facial features or his appearance, all fit their requirements very well.”

“More importantly, this person had a bad brain.”

“The woman was shocked by Xi Weiyue. She quickly broke away from Xi Weiyue’s embrace and hid at the corner of the bed, shivering.”

“Xi Weiyue looked at the woman. “Sister Half Moon, don’t you recognize me? I’m Weiyue!””

“The woman pulled the blanket over her head and only mumbled, “Don’t hit me, don’t hit me...””

“Sister Half Moon.”

“Yang Jiao walked over with reddened eyes. “Poor little half moon, how did she become like this! If sister Lang Hua saw this, wouldn’t her heart ache to death?””

“The staff turned to look at Yang Jiao. “Ms. Yang, are you sure this is the person you’re looking for?””

Yang Jiao hurriedly nodded. “It’s her! Her name is Ye Half Moon. She’s My Sister’s daughter!”

“”If you’re sure, come with me. We’ll go through the procedures. After the procedures are done, you can take her back.””

“”Okay! Okay.”Yang Jiao turned to look at Xi Weiyue. “Weiyue, stay here and accompany your sister. Mom will go through the procedures.””

“Okay.”Xi Weiyue nodded. “You should go now.”

“After the staff and Yang Jiao left, only Xi Weiyue and the woman were left in the room.” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Xi Weiyue smiled and looked at the woman who was hiding on the bed. She said gently, “Sister Half Moon, don’t be afraid. Don’t worry, I won’t hurt you.””

“The woman lifted the blanket and stole a glance at Xi Weiyue. Soon, she covered her head with the blanket again.”

“Sister Half Moon?”

“This time, the woman did not respond to XI Weiyue no matter what.”

Xi Weiyue looked around and did not see any surveillance equipment. Her face turned cold. “Come here!”

“She had enough of pretending in front of others. Now that she was facing a crazy woman, she did not want to continue pretending.”

The woman still had no reaction.

“Xi Weiyue stood up and walked to the bedside. She lifted the quilt on the woman and said coldly, “You’d better listen to me obediently! or I’ll beat you to death!””

“To such a crazy woman, she should use force to suppress her.”

“In fact, this kind of person was just pretending to be crazy and acting dumb!”

“If she did not listen, she could just go straight to the point. They would immediately listen to her obediently.”

“Seeing XI Weiyue like this, the woman was scared out of her wits. Her whole body was trembling. “Don’t hit me! Don’t hit me! I’ll listen obediently!””

“XI weiyue continued, “Get down from the bed now!””

The woman carefully got down from the bed. “Don’t hit me! Please don’t hit me...”

Xi Weiyue frowned slightly.

“From her angle, she could clearly see that there were clear pinching marks on the woman’s posterior force.”

The bruise looked very terrifying.

“It seemed that she was afraid of being hit before. Otherwise, she wouldn’t be so afraid of being hit.”

This kind of person was even easier to handle.

“Soon, Yang Jiao returned after completing the formalities. “Weiyue, let’s bring your sister back?””

“Sure.”Xi Weiyue stood up and held the woman’s hand.

“Xi Weiyue had driven here. At this moment, Yang Jiao was sitting in the passenger seat while the homeless woman sat alone in the passenger seat. Just as she closed the car door, the car was filled with a stench.”

“Xi Weiyue frowned in disgust and turned to look at Yang Jiao. “Mom, why does she smell so bad?””

Yang Jiao covered her nose. “She probably hasn’t showered in months. Let’s drive to the bathhouse first.”

“Okay.”Xi Weiyue nodded.

“Very soon, the car stopped at the entrance of a bathhouse.”

“The woman’s body was really smelly, but she did not know how to bathe herself. Yang Jiao gave 500 yuan to the bathhouse Auntie and asked her to help wash her.”

“The Lady in the bathhouse was initially unwilling, but when she saw the 500 yuan, she immediately smiled like a flower. “Sister, don’t worry. I promise to wash her body clean.””
