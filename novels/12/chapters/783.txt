“Gao Di smiled and sat opposite Wang Shuya. “Sister Ya, are you still worried about me?””

“Wang Shuya took a silver spoon and stirred the coffee in the cup. “If I was worried about you, I wouldn’t have come to you.””

“Gao Di raised the cup at Wang Shuya. “Thank you for Your Trust in me, Sister Ya.””

Wang Shuya also raised her cup.

A crisp clanging sound could be heard in the air.

“Wang Shuya took a sip of her coffee. “Gao Di, there mustn’t be any mistakes in this matter.””

“I know.”Gao di nodded.

...

“After Feng Xianxian and Gao di met up, she went to the fresh produce supermarket to buy some vegetables.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

She bought the vegetables that Old Lady Lin liked the most.

The fresh produce supermarket sold organic vegetables. She only bought a little and spent a few hundred yuan.

“When she paid, Feng Xianxian frowned slightly.”

“The 100,000 yuan that Old Lady Lin had given her previously was not much left now.”

“If Old Lady Lin continued to stay at her place and could not make ends meet for a long time, then in the following days, she could only drink northwest wind.”

On the way to the supermarket.

Feng Xianxian thought about a lot of things.

“In these few days, she would first appease Old Lady Lin. If Old Lady Lin was willing to leave 50% of the shares of the LIN Group to her, then she would not make a move.”

“If Old Lady Lin did not make a move, then she could only make the first move.”

“After returning home, Feng Xianxian personally cooked.”

The apartment’s kitchen was open. Old Lady Lin looked at the busy Feng Xianxian on the sofa in the living room and felt extremely touched.

“Her biological son, granddaughter, and grandson had never cooked a meal for her.”

But Feng Xianxian did it.

“”Xianxian, do you need help?”Old Lady Lin walked to Feng Xianxian’s side.”

“Feng Xianxian smiled and looked up. “I don’t need help. Grandmother, quickly go to the living room. The kitchen is too oily.””

“Old Lady Lin continued, “If you’re not afraid of me, what Am I afraid of?””

“Feng Xianxian walked out and pushed Old Lady Lin into the living room. “That’s different. You’re an old lady, and I’m a young man.””

“”This silly child,”old lady Lin said, “I’m not made of gold.””

“Feng Xianxian said, “In my eyes, you’re made of gold.””

Old Lady Lin was very happy to be coaxed.

“An hour later, Feng Xianxian finished cooking three dishes and a soup.”

“In order to take care of Old Lady Lin, Feng Xianxian specially cooked the dishes until they were very soft and rotten.”

Old Lady Lin noticed these details and was even more satisfied with Feng Xianxian.

After dinner.

“Old Lady Lin looked at Feng Xianxian and said, “Xianxian, I’ll go downstairs to take a look and digest my food.””

“Feng Xianxian stood up and said, “I’ll go with you.””

“No need.”Old Lady Lin waved her hand. “I’ll go down myself.”

“Feng Xianxian nodded. “Okay, then you take care of your safety.””

“Okay.”Old Lady Lin nodded. “I know. Don’t worry.”

Feng Xianxian sent Old Lady Lin Downstairs.

Old Lady Lin was not here to digest her food. She was here to make a call. She had to think of a way to let the old shareholders of the Lin Corporation know that she had been chased out by Lin Jin city.

“Once those shareholders knew of her current situation, they would definitely take action.”

Lin Jincheng wanted to cut off her economy?

“In the end, he was still too inexperienced!”

Three days.

“In just three days, she could make Lin Jincheng kneel down and beg her to go back.”

“Originally, Old Lady Lin did not want to make the matter known to everyone.”

That would be too ugly!

It was Lin Jincheng who forced her.

...

The Cen family.

“After Old Lady Cen heard about Old Lady Lin’s matter, she slapped her thigh so agitatedly that it made “PA PA”sounds.”

“”This is simply a case of good being rewarded for good, and evil being rewarded for Evil! Just you wait! That Old Fool’s retribution is still coming! For a person with another surname to cause such a ruckus with his own children and grandchildren, it’s simply extremely stupid!””

The height of stupidity?

Cen Yuyan wanted to laugh when she heard this.

“In her opinion, Old Lady Cen was the true height of stupidity.”

“In this world, how many grandmothers did not like their own biological granddaughter but liked an outsider?”

There was clearly something wrong with ye Zao.

“If ye Zao was really that good, would old lady Lin not like ye Zao?”

How was that possible?

“Old Lady Lin and ye Zao were of the same blood, how could she treat her own granddaughter like that?”

“In the entire Lin family, Old Lady Lin was probably the only one who understood.”

Look at the Lin family again.

“Before ye Zao returned, the Lin family was so harmonious.”

“After ye Zao returned, it became chaotic.”

Old Lady Lin was even angered by Lin Jincheng and left!

Could it be all the fault of the old lady of the Lin Family?
