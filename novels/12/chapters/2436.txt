“The assistant immediately nodded. “Alright, I’ll go now.” ”

“Very soon, the assistant brought doctor Liu over. ”

“Doctor Liu was in his early thirties this year and had a good relationship with song Shiyu. When he saw song Shiyu like this, he frowned and said, “What’s Wrong?”? ”

“”My stomach feels a little uncomfortable,”song Shiyu said. ”

“Doctor Liu had known song Shiyu for a long time. He knew song Shiyu’s personality and knew that song Shiyu must be extremely uncomfortable. Otherwise, he would never have said these words. ”

“When he heard this, doctor Liu quickly took out the stethoscope and checked song Shiyu’s pulse. ”

“Did you eat something outside?”Doctor Liu asked.

“Yes.”Song Shiyu nodded.

“Doctor Liu frowned slightly, then he said, “Why don’t you know how to cherish your body! How many times have I told you that you can’t eat anything from the outside in your current condition! Why Don’t you listen to me!” ”

“Due to his experience in his early years, song Shiyu’s spleen and stomach had always been bad. In recent years, his illness had been aggravated by some dietary habits. Therefore, the food that song Shiyu usually ate was matched by a professional dietitian. ”

“What did you eat?”Dr. Liu continued to ask.

“Song Shiyu answered, “I ate some cold noodles as my main food.” ”

“What else?”Dr. Liu asked.

“Song Shiyu continued, “Guan Dong cooked some stinky tofu.” ”

“Do you want to die? !”Dr. Liu raised his voice and asked.

Song Shiyu was silent for a moment and did not say anything.

“Dr. Liu continued, “Go and do some vomiting control.” ”

“Although it was not good to do vomiting, song Shiyu’s current condition meant that he had no other choice but to vomit. ”

“Can’t you not vomit?”Song Shiyu looked at Doctor Liu.

Doctor Liu subconsciously felt that something was not right. “Why aren’t you vomiting? Did Something Happen?”

“”There’s no reason. I just don’t want to vomit.”Song Shiyu drank a mouthful of warm water. “Actually, it’s not that uncomfortable.” ”

Doctor Liu looked at song Shiyu. “Are you sure you don’t want to induce vomiting?”

“Yes.”Song Shiyu nodded.

Doctor Liu massaged the space between his brows. “Let me prescribe some medicine for you first.”

“Sorry to trouble you.”

“Doctor Liu gave him a prescription. “Take this. If you don’t induce vomiting, you might feel a little uncomfortable at night. Bear with it.” ”

Song Shiyu continued to nod.

“Doctor Liu continued, “Boss song, your body is yours. No matter what others say, it’s useless. You have to be careful.” ”

Song Shiyu didn’t say anything.

Song Shiyu was a stranger.

“Doctor Liu frowned slightly. He saw an inexplicable sadness in song Shiyu. He couldn’t help but ask, “Boss song, did something happen?” ”

“”No.”Song Shiyu put down the glass of water. “Doctor Liu, sorry to trouble you.” ”

“After saying goodbye to Song Shiyu, Ye Zao returned to the villa. ”

The lights in the villa were turned off.

Cen Shaoqing was not back yet.

Ye Zao turned on the lights on his phone.

The room quickly became bright.

“Ye Zao hummed a tune and went to the bathroom, ready to take a bath. ”

“There were red rose petals prepared by the housekeeper in the bathroom. The air was emitting a faint flower fragrance, which was very nice. ”

“Just as the water was put in, footsteps came from outside the living room. ”

Is Cen Shaoqing back?

“Ye Zao raised her eyebrows slightly, put the towel back to its original place, and went to the living room. ”

“As soon as she came to the living room, she saw a tall figure walking in from outside. ”

It was Cen Shaoqing.

“”You’re back,”ye Zao said. ”

“”Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. He also brought back a bag of fresh lychees. “Concubine Xiao, do you want some?” ”

“Lychees were a specialty of the South China Sea. In this season, they couldn’t be eaten anywhere else. ”

“”Peel them well. I’ll come back to eat after I take a shower,”ye Zao said ”

Cen Shaoqing put the Buddha beads on the table. “Okay.”

Ye Zao turned around and went back to take a shower.

“Cen Shaoqing went to the bathroom to wash his hands carefully and disinfected them. Then, he came back and began to peel the lychees. ”

He peeled them very seriously and removed all the cores from the inside.

“Soon, he peeled a whole bowl of lychee meat. ”

“The snow-white lychee meat emitted a faint fragrance, which made people’s taste buds open. ”

“After peeling the lychee meat, Cen Shaoqing went to the kitchen and washed some fruits. He made a fruit scoop with yogurt. ”

“When Ye Zhuo came out of the bathroom, Cen Shaoqing was already sitting on the sofa eating the fruit scoop. ”

“Did you eat it tonight?”Ye Zhuo asked while drying his hair.

“”Just eat this.”Cen Shaoqing immediately put down the bowl in his hand, stood up, and walked to ye Zhuo’s side. “Let me blow-dry your hair.” ”
