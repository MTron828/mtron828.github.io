“”Thank you, Mom.”Zhao pingting continued, “Mom, I made you your favorite fish soup. Drink more. And Dad, this is your favorite clam. And Big Brother and sister-in-law, this is your favorite blood curd. Sister-in-law, try this taste!” ”

Tang Jia felt a little flattered.

“She did not expect that Zhao pingting, who usually looked so heartless, would actually remember the tastes of her family. ”

Zhao’s parents were also very happy.

She had grown up. This child had finally grown up.

She had a very happy meal.

After the meal.

Zhao Pingting took out the gifts that she had bought for her family today.

“”Dad, Mom, these are for you. Big Brother and sister-in-law, these are for you. Open them and see if you like them.” ”

Zhao Yingjun and Tang Jia opened their presents.

“When they saw what was in the box, they were shocked. “Pingting (little sister) , why did you give us such an expensive thing?” ”

“Zhao pingting smiled and said, “Big Brother and sister-in-law, don’t you like it?” ”

“”It’s not that I don’t like it, it’s that it’s too expensive! Pingting, where did you get the Money?”Zhao Yingjun asked. ”

“Zhao pingting said, “I bought it with the pocket money and New Year’s money that I’ve saved all these years.” ”

New Year’s money?

“Zhao Pingting was usually very stingy. Usually, as her brother, he couldn’t even borrow a single cent. ”

“This time, would she be so generous? ”

“Zhao Yingjun looked at Zhao Pingting suspiciously. “Pingting, do you have something that you want to ask your sister-in-law and me about? If there’s something, just say it.” ”

“Zhao Pingting shook her head. “No, brother, you’re thinking too much.” ”

Zhao Pingting’s parents opened their presents and were stunned. These things could not be bought without tens of thousands of yuan.

Why would Zhao Pingting buy such expensive things for them?

“Mother Zhao’s mind was sharp. She looked up at Zhao Pingting. “Pingting, tell me honestly. Did Something Happen to you?” ”

“Zhao pingting smiled and said, “Mom, what are you talking about! What could happen to me? I’m already nineteen years old. Can’t I just buy a gift for my family?” ”

Father Zhao did not think too much about it. He happily took down the Maotai and poured himself a glass. “This wine smells so good! My Daughter is the best to me!”

“Mother Zhao rolled her eyes at Father Zhao, then, she said, “Pingting, these things are not cheap. Even if you have money, you can’t spend it like this. Forget about your brother’s and sister-in-law’s things. I Can’t take this qipao. You can take it back tomorrow.”. “Oh right, I’ve signed you up for a driving school. Tomorrow, you’ll drive a school bus! “Try to get your driver’s license this summer vacation.” ”

“Hearing this, Zhao Yingjun and Tang Jia hurriedly said, “We can’t take our things either. You can return them together.” ”

“Zhao pingting smiled and said, “I’ve already given them to you guys. It’s impossible to return them again! Mom, Big Brother and sister-in-law, it’s been so many years, but I’ve never bought any gifts for you guys. Just accept them.” ”

“After saying that, Zhao pingting continued, “Mom, I don’t want to take the driver’s license anymore. You can go and get your tuition fees back tomorrow.” ”

She only had three months left in her life.

What was the point of learning how to drive?

“Zhao Pingting’s mother frowned slightly, “Pingting! What’s going on with You Tonight! ! If you don’t return the things that should be returned, why should you return the things that shouldn’t be returned? You must learn how to drive! As for these things! You must return them to the mall tomorrow! We are a family living our lives. Such extravagant things are not suitable for us! You should keep your money well. There are still a lot of places to spend your money on when you go to University!” ”

Zhao’s mother had her own thoughts.

Zhao Yingjun had been married for so long and still lived with them. He didn’t even have a house.

He had to be frugal where he should be.

He had spent tens of thousands of dollars in one go!

Her heart ached.

Zhao Pingting did not expect her mother to be so determined.

She knew that her mother was doing this for her own good.

But she was still angry.

She was still wronged.

“No matter what, this was her heartfelt wish. ”

She was going to leave soon.

She only wanted to do her best to buy some gifts for her family during the last period of her life.

Could it be that she couldn’t even fulfill this little wish?

“”I won’t go to the driving school! And these things, if you don’t like them, throw them into the trash can!” ”

Zhao Pingting’s mother was angered by Zhao Pingting. She slammed the table and stood up. “Zhao Pingting! Say That Again!”

Zhao Pingting held back her tears and walked into the room.

“Little Sister!”Tang Jia pulled on Zhao Pingting’s sleeve.

“”Tang Jia, leave her alone! Let Her Go! This child has been spoiled by us! Now she doesn’t know the immensity of Heaven and Earth!” ”

Tang Jia had no choice but to let go of Zhao Pingting’s hand.

Zhao Pingting walked into the room and lay on the bed. She couldn’t help but cry softly.

At the dining table.

Father Zhao looked at mother Zhao and frowned. “At least it’s a token of goodwill from the child! Why do you have to be such a Killjoy? It’s not a bad thing!”

“Drink! Drink! You only know how to drink!”Mother Zhao was furious. “Do you know how much your bottle of wine costs? Six Thousand Yuan! Six Thousand Yuan is enough for your monthly salary!”

Father Zhao was stunned.

“Mother Zhao sat down, her eyes red. “If she doesn’t return it, I’ll return it myself tomorrow!” ”

“Tang Jia said, “Mom, I’ll rest tomorrow. I’ll accompany you.” ”

Mother Zhao nodded.

Zhao Yingjun was a little worried. “I’ll go and see Pingting.”

Mother Zhao looked up at Zhao Yingjun. “No one is allowed to see her! This girl! She’s getting bolder and Bolder!”
