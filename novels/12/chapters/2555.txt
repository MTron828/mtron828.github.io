The operation failed. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

The person who became famous in the end turned out to be ye Zao.

Then what was he doing?

Making a wedding dress for ye Zao?

“Wang Dajun stood where he was. All the strength in his body seemed to have been sucked away in an instant. His feet were unsteady, and he almost fell to the ground. ”

“Fortunately, there was a wall on the side. ”

“People kept passing by Wang Dajun. They pointed at Wang Dajun and said, “Fortunately, there is Miss Ye. If it wasn’t for Miss Ye, Weiwei’s little life would have been lost!” ”

“Some people are just too confident in themselves! Don’t you see the consequences!”

“Shh! Lower Your Voice!”

“These words were heard by Wang Dajun. If it were any other time, he would have retorted directly. ”

But today was not the day.

Because the surgery had indeed failed.

He was now a person who had failed.

“If ye Zao had not made a move today, then a fresh life would have been lost in his hands. ”

An hour later.

The door of the operating theater was opened.

Three figures walked out from inside.

A slender figure walked in front. Even the wide surgical gown could not hide her beautiful figure.

“The sky-blue mask covered her stunning face, leaving only a pair of delicate phoenix eyes. ”

“At this moment, a group of reporters swarmed over and handed the microphone to ye Zao. ”

“”Miracle Doctor Ye, may I ask how you feel now?” ”

“Has the patient escaped from danger?”

“You were misunderstood by so many people back then. Do you have anything to say to everyone now?”

The reporters bombarded him with a series of questions.

“Ye Zao reached out to press the mask on his face and said in a clear and shallow tone, “In a word, saving lives and helping the injured is a doctor’s duty.” ”

“”Thank you.”She politely nodded at the camera. After saying that, she pushed the microphone aside and walked toward the exit. ”

The camera immediately aimed at her back.

“Soon, the slender figure disappeared in front of them, leaving the other two doctors to answer the reporters’questions. ”

“”This is a real doctor, not for fame and fortune.” ”

“”That’s right! If it were anyone else, they would definitely ignore her. After all, the patient and doctor Wang Don’t trust her.” ”

“”Also, did you guys notice that Miracle Doctor Ye has never shown her face in front of the camera? Every time, she would either wear a mask or only make a sound.” ”

“Am I seeing things? Why Do I feel that Miracle Doctor Ye is so similar to miss ye?”

“”What is the person upstairs thinking about? One is a god in the scientific and technological world, while the other is a god in the medical world. These two people are not from the same world, Okay?” ”

[ miss ye rarely shows her face. Does a real big shot not care about fame and fortune? ]

“[ not only are their eyes similar, but their voices are also very similar. ] ”

[ ... ]

There were also comments speculating whether Miracle Doctor Ye and Miss Ye were biological sisters.

Wang Dajun was still sitting on the spot.

“At this moment, a nurse walked over from the side. “Doctor Wang.” ”

Wang Dajun raised his head to look at the nurse.

“The nurse continued, “Director Han wants you to make a trip over.” ”

“”... Alright.”After a long while, Wang Dajun finally nodded. ”

“In a moment, Wang Dajun stood up from the ground and walked towards the director’s office. ”

“Very soon, he arrived at the director’s office. ”

Director Han was sitting on the office chair.

“”Director.”At this moment, Wang Dajun no longer had the spring breeze of the past two days. ”

“In the end, he had overestimated himself. ”

“Director Han put down the pen, looked at Wang Dajun, and continued to speak, “Doctor Wang, none of us want to see the consequences that have resulted. When you decided to have the surgery, I warned you that you must bear all the consequences yourself.” ”

“Yes.”Wang Dajun nodded. “I know.”

“Director Han glanced at Wang Dajun and continued, “Fortunately, Miss ye acted in time. Otherwise, you would have already been involved in a criminal case!” ”

“Wang Dajun had insisted on this surgery. At that time, the entire hospital had opposed it. If something happened and his family insisted on holding him accountable, Wang Dajun would definitely be held accountable for intentional murder. ”

Wang Dajun did not say anything. His expression was downcast.

“Director Han frowned. “If you had realized your mistake earlier, would you still be in this situation?” ”

Wang Dajun was also very regretful.

But what was the use of regretting now?

“Director Han continued, “You can report to the logistics department tomorrow.” ”

A person like Wang Dajun was really not suitable to continue appearing in the operating theater.

“Although he had long known that he would receive the surgery like this, he still felt extremely uncomfortable when he heard director Han’s words. ”

It was a humiliation for him to be suddenly demoted from a chief physician to the hospital’s logistics department!

A scholar could be killed but not humiliated!
