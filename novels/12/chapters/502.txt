Translator: 549690339

He hoped that they could reunite as a family.

Even in his dreams.

“Seeing the father and son like this, Ye Shu’s heart suddenly softened, especially when she saw the look in Lin Ze’s eyes. ”

Ye Shu turned to look at Lin Jincheng.”... give me some time. I’ll think about it.”

“Hearing this, Lin Jincheng was overjoyed. “Ah Shu, thank you! Thank you!” ”

“As long as Ye Shu was willing to think about it, it meant that there was still hope between them. ”

“Ye Shu closed her eyes. “You can go back first.”She wanted to calm down, but when she saw Lin Jincheng’s face, she couldn’t calm down. ”

“”Okay, okay.”Lin Jincheng nodded hurriedly. “I’ll leave now. Ah Shu, you must think about it. Ah Ze and I will come back to look for you in three days, okay?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Shu nodded.

“After saying this, Lin Jincheng brought Lin Ze and reluctantly left the ye residence. ”

The car was parked outside.

The driver saw the bruised and swollen Lin Jincheng and was shocked.

What had happened?

“Lin Jincheng sat in the car and ordered the driver, “Go to the hospital.” ”

“Okay.”

“After saying this, Lin Jincheng sent a message to his secretary, asking him to find out what had happened to Ye Shu in the cloud capital last year. ”

Just what had happened to Ye yourong.

Why had he not seen ye Zhuo at that time.

The fact that the MU family had carried the wrong child was not a local secret in the cloud capital.

“Very soon, the secretary found out. ”

“When he saw the information sent by his secretary, Lin Jincheng was immediately stunned. ”

He had carried the wrong child.

So that was how it was!

Lin Jincheng’s shoulders were trembling violently.

“Dad? Are You Alright?”Lin Ze tilted his head and looked at Lin Jincheng.

“Lin Jincheng tried his best to suppress the sadness in his body. “I’m fine, I’m fine...” ”

“Seeing that Lin Jincheng did not want to say anything more, Lin Ze did not say anything more. ”

He was also very nervous now. He did not know if his mother and sister would accept them.

...

“At the same time, at the Lin family home. ”

“Old Lady Lin was lying on the bed, cursing at Ye Shu, “Ye Shu, that promiscuous B * Tch! It’s been so many years, but Jin city still can’t let her go. She first harmed my son, and now she’s come to harm my grandson!”Now, her son was not her son, her grandson was not her grandson. ”

“After cursing, she started coughing violently again. ”

Aunt Zhang quickly helped Old Lady Lin catch her breath.

“With this cough, Old Lady Lin thought of Feng Qianhua again, and tears rolled down her cheeks. “I’ve let Qianhua Down, our Lin family has let Qianhua down... Qianhua is a good child...” ” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Previously, Feng Qianhua would send her a bowl of health-preserving soup every afternoon, and she had to use health-preserving soup to suppress her cough. ”

“Now that Lin Jincheng suddenly announced the cancellation of the engagement party, the Feng family and Feng Qianhua had lost so much face. Feng Qianhua would definitely never send her health-preserving soup again in the future. ”

Not to mention Feng Qianhua.

“If she were Feng Qianhua, she would not forgive herself either. ”

“The More Old Lady Lin thought about it, the more uncomfortable she felt. Her eyes became redder and redder, and her lungs seemed to be about to explode. There were tens of millions of ants gnawing at them. ”

Ye Shu!

It was all ye Shu’s fault!

“Why doesn’t that Fickle B * Tch Die! Cough Cough Cough!”

“Aunt Zhang patted Old Lady Lin on the shoulder and said, “Old lady, don’t worry. Miss Qianhua is kind-hearted. As long as Jin Cheng admits his mistake, she will definitely forgive him.” ”

“After saying that, aunt Zhang continued, “Miss Qianhua is a widower. Now that such a thing has happened, how will the mother and daughter be able to raise their heads in the capital in the future?” ”

“Having their engagement annulled on the day of the engagement banquet, such a thing had never happened in the circle of wealthy families. ”

“Old Lady Lin was already very guilty. Now that Aunt Zhang said that, she felt even more guilty! ”

“Has there been any news from Jin city from the Butler?”Old Lady Lin asked.

“Aunt Zhang said somewhat helplessly, “He’s not picking up the butler’s call.” ”

“Old Lady Lin slapped the edge of the bed loudly, she coughed and said, “Unfilial son! Unfilial Son! Instead of the virtuous Qianhua, go find a B * Tch who cheated on him! Does he really like being a cuckold so much?” ”

Old Lady Lin only regretted letting Lin Jincheng control the power of the Lin family early on.

“If the person in charge of the Lin family was still her, Lin Jincheng would definitely not dare to do this. ”

“At this moment, footsteps sounded from outside the door. ”

Who Was It?

Old Lady Lin’s eyes lit up. She looked outside the door. Could It Be Feng Qianhua?

But such a thing had just happened between the two families. Why would feng Qianhua come to see her?

“Thinking of this, the light in Old Lady Lin’s eyes dimmed again. ”
