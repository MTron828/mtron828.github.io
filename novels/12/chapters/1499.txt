“Meow!”The kitten sniffed and walked over as if it understood song Shiyu’s words.

“Song Shiyu patted the Little Guy’s head and picked it up. The Little Guy didn’t struggle, but found a comfortable seat in song Shiyu’s arms.”

“Song Shiyu, who never liked small animals, had a soft look in his eyes when he saw a cat for the first time.”

“After a while, song Shiyu walked to the office with the cat in his arms. “Jack, go and find out whose cat this is.””

Jack turned around and saw his boss holding a cat in his arms.

“A big man holding a cute creature with snow-white fur in his arms. This scene was very out of place, especially for song Shiyu, who didn’t like small animals very much.”

“”Boss, are you talking about the cat you’re holding?”Jack asked.”

“Yes.”Song Shiyu nodded.

“Jack continued, “If it’s this cat, there’s no need to check.””

“What do you mean?”Song Shiyu asked.

“Jack continued, “This cat doesn’t have an owner. It’s usually fed by the staff and the guests who stay in the hotel.””

“Song Shiyu continued, “Go and do the formalities. I’ll be its owner from now on.””

Jack was stunned. “You want to bring it back to China?”

“Yes.”

“Jack was stunned for a moment. “Alright, I’ll do it right away.””

On the other side.

China.

The Cen family manor.

Ye Zhuo’s flight was at 1 am.

“At 12 am, Cen Shaoqing tiptoed downstairs, put on his coat and hat, and walked out.”

“At this moment, Old Madam Cen suddenly appeared in front of Cen Shaoqing.”

“Grandma.”Cen Shaoqing pinched the Buddhist beads. “Why are you still up so late?”

“Old Mrs. Cen looked Cen Shaoqing up and down, narrowed her eyes, and said, “I didn’t sleep, and you didn’t sleep either. Tell Me, why are you sneaking around? Do You Want to Cuckold Big Scorch?””

“Realizing this problem, old Mrs. Cen raised her walking stick, “Get lost! Get the hell back! Get the hell back right now! You son of a bitch, if you dare to do anything to Big Scorch, I’ll break your legs! I’ll make sure you never leave the house for the rest of your life! Ever since Scorch went to C Nation, I realized that you’re really too arrogant!””

“In the past, Cen Shaoqing had never left the house in the middle of the night.”

“But now, it was already twelve o’clock, and he was still running outside!”

This was really his biological grandmother!

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “You’ve misunderstood. I’m going to pick up our leader. She’s coming back today and will be at the airport at one o’clock.””

“Really?”

“Yes.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

Old Mrs. Cen took out her phone. “I’ll call and ask!”

“Cen Shaoqing twirled the prayer beads and continued, “She’s on the plane right now. She’s in flight mode. You Won’t be able to get through.””

“”Alright then.”Old Mrs. Cen hung up the phone and continued, “You go ahead. I’ll call my granddaughter-in-law when she gets off the plane.””

“”Aren’t you going to Sleep Yet?”CEN Shaoqing said, “It’s getting late. You should go to bed earlier. It’s not good for the body of an old person to sleep too late.””

“”You’re the old person! Your whole family is an old person!”Old Mrs. Cen glared at Cen Shaoqing, “Don’t think that I don’t know what you’re thinking. At one o’clock, I’ll call searing flames to verify it. If you dare to lie to me, you can forget about getting this pair of lackeys!””

“Cen Shaoqing did not say anything else. “Grandma, I’ll be leaving first.””

“Get lost! I’m so annoyed to see you!”Old Mrs. Cen waved her hand impatiently.

Cen Shaoqing pushed the door open and walked out.

“It was snowing heavily outside. Old Mrs. Cen looked at Cen Shaoqing’s back and said, “Drive slowly when you come back! Don’t drop my granddaughter-in-law!””

Cen Shaoqing:”...”he suspected that he was not his biological grandson.

“Seeing Cen Shaoqing’s figure disappear at the door, old Mrs. Cen turned around and walked into the door.”

“Sister Tang.”A white-haired old man walked out from inside.

“This old man was old Mrs. Cen’s cousin, Bai Shu. Bai Shu was two years younger than old Mrs. Cen.”

“Yes.”Old Mrs. Cen raised her head to look at Bai Shu.

“Bai Shu asked curiously, “It’s already so late, why is Shaoqing still going out?”” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Old Mrs. Cen replied, “He went to receive his leader.””

“Leader?”Bai Shu was stunned. “Isn’t Shaoqing the company’s biggest official? Who is his leader?”

“Old Madam Cen smiled and said, “It’s his wife!”! Oh right, you haven’t met my granddaughter-in-law, right! Let me tell you, my granddaughter-in-law is very beautiful. She has a good figure, a good voice, and an outstanding person. She is simply loved by everyone. She is in a daze when she sees a bird! The ancestors of the Cen family must have saved the Milky Way galaxy in their previous life to allow Shaoqing to marry such an outstanding daughter-in-law! I’m not bragging, but if your ah Niu could marry such a good daughter-in-law like my granddaughter-in-law, you would wake up laughing in your dreams!””
