“Chapter 835: 183: Little Half Moon is still alive, a worthless trinket! 1”

Translator: 549690339

Ye Langhua hated Xi Muwen.

But what right did she have to Hate Xi Muwen?

“After all, Little Half Moon’s disappearance had nothing to do with Xi Muwen.”

She did not know what ye Langhua was blaming Xi Muwen for.

“She was Little Half Moon’s mother, it was her responsibility to look after the child.”

“If she could not even look after her own child, what right did she have to blame Xi Muwen?”

“It was fine if she did not look after her child well, but now she had to push the blame onto Xi Muwen.”

This was a little shameless!

“Not only was she shameless, she was also extremely shameless.”

“If she had to say that she was sorry, it was ye Langhua who had let Xi Muwen down.”

Back then.

“If grandfather Ye had been a little nicer to XI Muwen, Xi Muwen would not have been so ruthless.”

Was her son-in-law inhuman?

This ye Langhua was just like the dead elder Ye.

She was just an ingrate that could not be raised properly. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“She was so nice to Ye Langhua, but ye Langhua did not say anything to her, as if he was guarding against her like a thief.”

“When she thought of this, a flash of unhappiness flashed across Xi Weiyue’s eyes.”

Aunt Lang did not say anything.

The grudge between her and Xi Muwen could not be resolved with just a few words.

She did not hate anyone now. She only hated herself for not recognizing people clearly back then and did not listen to grandfather Ye’s words.

“If she had listened to grandfather Ye’s words, she would not have ended up in this state.”

“Xi Weiyue sighed and half-squatted down to hold Aunt Lang’s hands, she choked with sobs and said, “Aunt, can you please forgive my father? Don’t look at him living such a glorious life. It’s just a superficial glory. Only he himself knows this heartache.””

Aunty Lang turned to look at Xi Weiyue.

“Xi Weiyue looked like half a month, especially when she smiled. Her expression was at least 80% similar. Looking at Xi Weiyue’s face, Aunty Lang seemed to see half a month after she grew up.”

“After a while, aunty lang continued, “Weiyue, you haven’t eaten yet, right? What do you want to eat? I’ll make it for you.””

Changing the topic.

Ye Langhua was changing the topic!

She had already said it to this extent. What did ye Langhua want?

Ye Banyue was already dead.

Could it be that ye Langhua still wanted Xi Muwen to pay with his life?

“Moreover, this matter had nothing to do with Xi Muwen.”

She did not know why Xi Muwen would fall for a person like ye Langhua when he was young!

Xi weiyue suppressed the unhappiness in her heart and nodded. “Sure! I want to eat the Yang Chun noodles that you personally cooked.”

Aunt Lang smiled. “That’s easy. You can sit here for a while.”

“MMM.”Xi Weiyue nodded.

Aunt Lang turned around and walked towards the kitchen.

“Xi Weiyue followed. “Aunt, I’ll go help you.””

“Aunt Lang waved her hand. “No need, no need. You sit here for a while. I’ll be right over.””

“”Then it’s been hard on you, aunt.””

“It’s just a bowl of noodles. What’s there to be hard about?”

Xi Weiyue looked at Aunt Lang’s back and narrowed her eyes. Her eyes were filled with viciousness.

She had specially come to celebrate ye Banyue’s birthday.

But what about ye Langhua?

“Not only did he not appreciate her kindness, he even showed her his face.”

It was clearly her birthday today as well.

But Ye Langhua threw it to the back of his mind. He only remembered the Dead Ye Banyue!

The person who died was already dead.

Could it be that she could not be compared to a dead person?

No wonder ye Banyue died.

A person like ye Langhua was destined to have no descendants! She was destined to be alone for the rest of her life!

Xi Weiyue clenched her fists.

“She had seen pictures of Ye Banyue when she was young, so she naturally knew that she looked a little like ye Banyue.”

Ye Banyue was dead.

“And she looked so much like ye Banyue. As long as she used some tricks, she would definitely be able to make ye Langhua believe in her.”

“In the future, she would be ye Langhua’s only heir, and everything ye Langhua had would be hers!”

No one would be able to take away what belonged to her!

“Ye Langhua, this heartless old hag, once she got what she wanted, she would definitely teach ye Langhua a lesson!”

How Proud Ye Langhua was now.

How regretful he would be in the future!

Just you wait!

“Xi Weiyue looked in the direction where Aunt Lang had disappeared, her eyes filled with determination.”

“Even though ye Langhua was still unwilling to tell her anything about the Shunxi Financial Group and the treasure map, she believed that one day, ye Langhua would be willing to tell him.”

In the kitchen.

“Aunt Lang was busy cooking noodles for XI weiyue. There was broth boiling in the pot. As long as a handful of vegetables, a handful of fine noodles, some soy sauce, and some chopped green onions were added, a bowl of Yang Chun noodles would be ready.”

“Once upon a time, ye Langhua was also a rich heiress. Ever since she disappeared half a month ago, she had gone from a rich heiress to an all-knowing Aunty Lang.”
