“Zhang Qingqing stood upstairs and watched an Lizi’s departing figure, her eyes filled with pride. ”

So what if an Lizi was a young miss of a wealthy family?

She still played an Lizi like a fool!

“A country bumpkin was a country bumpkin. Even if she was plated with a layer of gold, an Lizi would not become a true young miss of a wealthy family. ”

She was the only one who was truly suitable for a wealthy family.

“After tonight, she would be the young mistress of the Lin family, an Lizi’s sister-in-law. ”

“Thinking of this, the corners of Zhang Qingqing’s mouth curled up into a proud smile. ”

“Next, she only needed to prepare everything. ”

“Thinking of the scene tonight, Zhang Qingqing decided to put on some makeup. After thinking for a while, she felt that putting on makeup would not be good for the child in her stomach. She searched the internet and found that there were people selling cosmetics for pregnant women. She immediately went downstairs to buy cosmetics. ”

On the other side.

Ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing went to visit ye Langhua for half a month.

“The current ye Langhua looked radiant and energetic. She looked more than ten years younger. It was as if she was a different person. If it was an old friend who had not seen her for a few years, she really would not dare to admit it! ”

“Seeing Cen Shaoqing and Ye Zhuo, ye Langhua thought that she had seen wrongly. She quickly stood up and walked to the two of them. Only then did she dare to confirm that she had not seen wrongly, “Zhuozhuo, Shaoqing! Why are you here? I thought I had seen wrongly just now!” ”

“Grandma.”Cen Shaoqing called out politely.

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Is grandma not welcoming us?” ”

“”This child, how can Grandma Not Welcome You! Come in, come in! It’s too cold outside!” ”

“Ye zhuo ridiculed, “I thought Grandma did not welcome us!” ”

“”Grandma can’t wait for you to come every day,”ye Langhua said. “What I mean is that if you had informed me in advance, I would have prepared a lot of food! “Don’t you like jujube cake the most, Zhuo Zhuo? “Jujube cake needs to be made in advance! “If you had told me earlier, you would have eaten jujube cake now!” ”

Ye Zhuo held ye Langhua’s arm. “Then I will definitely tell you in advance when I come next time.”

“”Okay.”Ye langhua nodded and continued, “What do you want to eat, Zhuo Zhuo? Grandma will cook it for You Now!” ” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“I like to eat whatever Grandma Cooks.”

“Hearing this, Ye Langhua was overjoyed. “What about Shaoqing?” ”

“Just as Cen Shaoqing was about to say ‘me too’, Ye Zhuo said with a smile, “Grandma, don’t you know him well? Just prepare more grass for him!” ”

“Ye Langhua said with a smile, “You child, Shaoqing is no longer a monk, how can he still eat grass!” ”

Cen Shaoqing:”...”he said as if he had really been a monk before.

“After saying that, ye langhua continued to ask, “Shaoqing, what do you want to eat?” ”

Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads and glanced at ye Zao faintly. “I’ll just eat the same as Zao Zao.”

“”Alright, I’ll go prepare the dishes. You two sit in the house for a while.” ”

“Ye Zhuo followed ye Langhua’s footsteps. “Grandma, I’ll go help you.” ”

“”No need, no need.”Ye Langhua pushed ye Zhuo out. “Little du is here. She can help me. The smell is too strong in there!” ”

“”Alright then!”Ye Zhuo continued, “If you need help, just let me know.” ”

“Okay.”Ye Langhua nodded and walked inside.

“Ye Langhua went to the kitchen while ye Zhuo walked into the house. Cen Shaoqing followed her footsteps and said, “Leader.” ”

“Okay?”Ye Zhuo looked back slightly.

“I have something to tell you.”Cen Shaoqing walked to her side.

“Speak.”

“Cen Shaoqing was tall and had long legs. He was almost 1.91 meters tall. Ye Zhuo was 1.73 meters tall, which was considered quite tall among the girls. However, in front of Cen Shaoqing, he still felt a huge pressure, why was a man so tall? ”

“Cen Shaoqing bent his body slightly and pressed his thin lips against ye Zao’s ear. He said in a low voice, “I’m not a monk. I eat meat and drink wine.” ”

“The warm breath blew into his ear and itched a little. Even after spending so much time with Cen Shaoqing, ye Zao could not help but feel his heart beat faster. “So be it. Why are you telling me this?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing’s thin lips curved into an extremely faint arc. “Also, my waist is especially good.” ”

“His voice was somewhat hoarse, and his pair of deep phoenix eyes were like ink. ”

An especially good waist?

Was there anything worth showing off?

“Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly, and spoke as if her waist was not good. “My waist is also very good!” ”

“Hearing this, Cen Shaoqing sized her up, and his gaze finally fell on her waist. ”

“Today, Ye Zao was wearing a black cheongsam with a burgundy woolen coat over it. Now that the coat had been removed, only a black cheongsam was left. Cheongsam was a very picky type of clothing, the smooth lines outlined the slender waist that could be grasped easily, as if it would snap at any moment. ”
