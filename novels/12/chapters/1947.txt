Translator: 549690339

“Hearing this, Xu Yao smiled and said, “Really?” ”

He ziteng held the steering wheel with one hand and held Xu Yao’s arm with the other. “Of course it’s true. Do you know that I’ve been dreaming of Marrying You Back?”

Xu Yao slapped his hand back. “Drive well.”

“Yes.”He ziteng immediately sat up straight.

A glimmer flashed across Xu Yao’s eyes.

The speed of the car was neither fast nor slow. They arrived at He Ziteng’s residence about 15 minutes later.

He ziteng lived in a high-end apartment.

“It was not Xu Yao’s first time here, so the moment she entered the apartment, she looked up at He ziteng. “Ziteng, you should go back first. Auntie is still waiting for you at home!” ”

He ziteng was a little worried. “Then can you do it alone?”

“”Yes, no problem.”Xu Yao smiled and said, “I’m not a child anymore, what’s wrong with that? Go quickly! Don’t make Auntie Wait for You!” ”

He ziteng nodded. “Then I’ll be back soon.”

“”Okay.”Xu Yao sent he ziteng out of the door and then reminded him, “After you go home, don’t quarrel with uncle and Auntie. Harmony makes money. Moreover, you’re a junior.” ”

“He ziteng sighed with emotion at Xu Yao’s kindness and nodded, “Okay, I understand. Yaoyao, don’t worry, I know what to do! But this matter, I will not let it go just like that. I will ask my mother to give you an explanation.” ”

“Xu Yao smiled and said, “Ziteng, I am already very satisfied that you have such a heart. I believe in You and know that you are not some MAMA’s boy. You Don’t have to explain anything to me. I really don’t blame anyone for everything that happened today.” ”

He ziteng reached out and hugged her

“Seeing that he ziteng’s car had disappeared outside the door, Xu Yao picked up her phone and sent a wechat message to her parents, telling them about the situation here. ”

The Xu parents were naturally willing to let Xu Yao and he ziteng live in the same room.

“After all, if that was the case, it would be easier for Xu Yao to conceive he ziteng’s child. ”

“Once Xu Yao was pregnant with He Ziteng’s child, would she need to look down on others in the future? ”

On the other side.

He ziteng returned home.

“Waiting for him was mother he, whose face was filled with anger. ”

“Mother he was angry, and he ziteng was even angrier than her. ”

“But when he thought of Xu Yao’s instructions, he ziteng still calmly said, “Dad, Mom.” ”

“Mother he looked at he ziteng and said, “Have a seat.” ”

He Ziteng sat opposite his mother.

“”Xu Yao is not suitable for you,”mother he said. ” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

He ziteng regarded Xu Yao as the love of his heart. He would not marry her unless it was her. How could he stand such words.

“”Mother, Xu Yao is a kind-hearted and good girl. Other than her family background, she has everything she wants. Why isn’t she suitable for me?” ”

“He ziteng’s mother continued, “Based on her hypocrisy, she lied to her parents on her first visit. She’s not suitable for you.” ”

“Hypocrisy? Lies?”He ziteng frowned slightly. “When has Yaoyao ever done such a Thing?”

Xu Yao was a good girl who never lied!

“If the person in front of him was not his biological mother, he ziteng would have fallen out with her long ago. ”

This was too much!

How could she treat Xu Yao like this?

“”You don’t really think that Xu Yao made those pastries herself, do you?”Mother he looked at He ziteng. ”

“He ziteng asked in return, “If she didn’t do it, could it be that you did it? Mother, one has to have a conscience. In order to make the pastries for you, yaoyao had her hands sewn up 10 times! But she didn’t complain at all to you. She even blamed herself for all the mistakes!” ”

“Mother he was a person who couldn’t show her emotions. Usually, no matter how angry she was, she could still maintain a smile. But today, her anger was ignited by he ziteng, “He ziteng! Is it because I have no conscience or because you have no brain!” ”

“”Mom,”he ziteng felt that his mother was making trouble in the house, “I don’t understand what you’re trying to do! When I didn’t bring my girlfriend back, you and dad urged me every day. Now that I’ve brought my girlfriend back, you’re acting like this again! “Mom, I’m not some Mommy’s baby boy that you can control at will!” ”

Xu Yao was right. His mother wanted to raise him into a mommy’s baby boy.

A Mommy’s baby boy who had no opinions and listened to his mother in everything!

“Mother he was really angered to death. Her hands were on the table, and her entire body was trembling. “W-what did you say?” ”

“She had never had too much restraint on he ziteng, but he ziteng said such words. ”

It was outrageous!

It was simply outrageous!

“He ziteng continued, “Mother, I’m officially informing you now. Whether you agree or not, I want to be with Xu Yao! I want to marry and have children with Xu Yao! Unless I never marry in the future, otherwise, my future wife will definitely be Xu Yao!” ”

“After saying this, he ziteng was extremely determined. ”

Mother he looked at he ziteng like this. “What if I don’t agree?”

“He ziteng said, “I’ve said it before, I’m not some Mama’s boy. Regardless of whether you agree or not, I want to be with Xu Yao!” ”

“Father he quickly said, “Ziteng! What nonsense are you talking about! Quickly apologize to your mother. Your Mother is doing this for your own good. She’s afraid that you’ll regret it in the future! Xu Yao is not your lover!” ”

“”Doing this for my own good?”He ziteng pointed at himself, his face full of ridicule. “Other than using the phrase ‘doing this for my own good’to carry out the kidnapping of love, what else can you say? !” ”

How many parents would kidnap their children in the name of ‘for the sake of their children’? !

“He ziteng never expected that one day, he would become one of them. ”

Ridiculous.

This was too ridiculous!

Mother he looked at he ziteng without any expression on her face. She never knew that this was the image of herself in he ziteng’s heart.

“”Ziteng, do you really think so?”Mother he looked at He ziteng, then she said, “Think about it carefully. All these years, when have I ever forced you? Who Is Xu Yao? She is a scheming woman who is full of lies. You have never known her! What she has shown in front of you is a fake side!” ”

A fake side?

He didn’t believe it!

He ziteng would never believe that it was real.

Xu Yao was a rare good girl. She would never lie!

He ziteng had been with Xu Yao for so long. He knew Xu Yao very well.

“He Ziteng knew that his mother was in a rage right now. No matter what she said, his mother wouldn’t listen. Thinking that Xu Yao was still waiting for him at home, he ziteng continued, “Mom, calm down first. I’m leaving.” ”

“Ziteng! Where are you going?”Father he caught up with He ziteng’s footsteps.

“He ziteng stopped in his tracks and turned to look at his father. He continued, “I’m going out to stay for a few days. You stay at home and take good care of Mom.” ”

“”Ziteng!”Father he wanted to say something more, but he had already gone far away with Ziteng. ”

“Father he walked to his mother’s side and continued, “Xunfang, don’t be angry. What’s there to be angry about with your own child!” ”

“Did you hear what he said just now?”Mother he asked.

“Father he nodded. “I did, but those were all angry words. You Don’t have to take it to heart.” ”

Angry Words?

Was what he ziteng said just now Angry Words?

“As a mother, no one knew her son better than she did. ”

Mother he knew clearly that what he ziteng said just now was not angry words. He really wanted to marry Xu Yao.

“However, was she worthy of such a scheming woman like Xu Yao? ”

She was not worthy!

She was not worthy of He Ziteng’s deep love at all!

“Father he continued, “Oh right, just now Ziteng mentioned Mama Baby Boy. What does Mama Baby Boy Mean?” ”

Mother he frowned.

It was obvious that Xu Yao had told he ziteng these words.

“Otherwise, he ziteng would never have said the words ‘Mama Baby Boy’. ”

“Mother he said, “If you don’t know, Go look it up on Baidu!” ”

Father he scratched his head gloomily. “Can’t you just tell me directly? Why are you making it so troublesome?”

“Scram!”Mother he couldn’t take it anymore.

Father he immediately scurried away.

“On the other side, he ziteng returned to the apartment. ”

“Xu Yao was busy working in the kitchen with one hand. When she saw this scene, he immediately trotted over. “Yaoyao, what are you doing? Don’t you know that you’ve just been injured?” ”

“Xu Yao smiled and said, “It’s just a superficial injury. It’s not a big deal. By the way, you didn’t argue with uncle and Auntie when you went back, right?” ”

“He ziteng shook his head. “Don’t worry, I didn’t.” ”

“That’s good.”

“Looking at Xu Yao like this, he ziteng felt his heart ache. ”

“Mother he had slandered Xu Yao in all sorts of ways, but Xu Yao still treated mother he the same. ”

Where could she find such a good daughter-in-law?

But mother he did not know how to cherish her.

“He ziteng took the spatula from Xu Yao’s hand and continued, “I’ll Cook whatever you want to eat.” ”

“Xu Yao smiled and said, “Do you know how to Cook? I’ll do it. You’ll be my assistant.” ”

“That’s fine too.”He ziteng nodded and acted as Xu Yao’s right hand.

“Two hours later, Xu Yao finished cooking three dishes and a soup. The two of them ate at the dining table. ”

“As they ate, the atmosphere became a little weird. Unknowingly, the two of them had become entangled. ”

From the living room to the bedroom.

“Looking at he ziteng who was lying beside her, Xu Yao’s lips curled up. ”

“This time, she must be pregnant with he ziteng’s child! ”
