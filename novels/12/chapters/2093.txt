“If he had discovered the truth, things would not have turned out this way. ”

Unfortunately...

“Zhao Dan and Man Jiangshan, as the masters of Manxing country, naturally would not admit that they had abandoned their own daughter. Hence, they kept announcing that the full moon had disappeared. ”

“Until, man Wen overheard the conversation between his parents. ”

Only then did he start to investigate.

“When he found out ye Zhuo’s identity, man Wen was both excited and nervous. ”

“He wanted to call ye Zhuo his elder sister, but he was afraid that his appearance would bring unnecessary trouble to Ye Zhuo. ”

“Hence, he chose to remain calm. ”

“”Old Wen, this matter is really not your responsibility,”fan mu continued, “I believe that Miss Ye will not blame you.” ”

“MAN WEN continued, “Can you confirm if she’s safe now?” ”

“”Don’t worry, Ye Han’s character is still trustworthy. Although she and Miss ye aren’t blood-related siblings, he treats miss ye better than his own sister.” ”

“En.”Man Wen nodded.

“Fan Mu continued, “Old Wen, you’re different from your parents and that sister of yours. Why Don’t you go and explain everything to Miss Ye! Miss Ye won’t acknowledge those people from your family, why don’t she just acknowledge you directly?” ”

“After all, they were blood-related siblings. It wasn’t a big deal for man Wen to continue living in guilt. ”

“”There’s no need.”Man Wen looked at fan mu, his eyes filled with determination. “Fan Mu, don’t say too much. Otherwise, this brother of ours will be done.” ”

“Seeing that he was so serious, fan mu hurriedly said, “No, no, no. Brother, don’t worry. I definitely won’t say too much in front of Miss Ye!” ”

“”En.”Man Wen continued, “Help me listen over there for the time being.” ”

“”Don’t worry, I know. I’ll arrange for people to watch over Miss Ye’s side. I definitely won’t let anyone hurt her!”Fan Mu said. ”

“Man Wen instructed, “She’s very vigilant. You guys be careful. Don’t be discovered.” ”

“En.”Fan Mu nodded.

“At this moment, the sound of light footsteps came from outside the door. Fan Mu immediately reacted from the other end and said with a cheeky smile, “Old Wen, are you going or not! Give me a straightforward answer!” ”

“I don’t know.”Man Wen also returned to his casual look. “Send me a few photos first!”

“”Okay, wait a moment.” ”

Du Du du —

“At this moment, there was a knock on the door. ”

“”Come in,”man Wen said. ”

Man Xing pushed the door open and came in.

Man Wen was so scared that he immediately cut off the communication device. “Sis.”

“What are you doing in the house? Are you panicking?”Man Xing asked.

“”It’s nothing,”man Xing asked. ”

“Really nothing?”Man Xing asked.

“”It’s really nothing,”man Wen forced himself to remain calm. ”

“MAN XING smiled and said, “Alright, Alright. I heard everything! “You’re already a grown man. You should just mind your own business and know your limits when you do things. I can help you hide it for a while, but can I help you for the rest of your life? “You’re the only son of your parents. Your parents will have to rely on you in the future. You have to be a man!” ”

“”Don’t We Still Have You?”Man Wen continued, “I’ll just set you off!” ”

“Man Wen!”Man Xing’s face turned stern. “You really can’t continue like this.”

Man Wen couldn’t be bothered with man Xing. He directly picked up the earplugs and covered his ears.

It was best not to listen. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Seeing him like this, man Xing shook his head helplessly. ”

Man Wen had always been like this.

Ignorant and incompetent. Even Fan Mu was better than him. He was still fooling around all day and had no self-awareness at all.

“Man Xing sighed and said earnestly, “Man Wen, even if you don’t listen to me, you have to think about mom and dad. Mom and dad have worked hard to raise you. Is this how you repay them?” ”

Man Wen did not hear what man Xing said at all. He hummed a little song as he walked into the bedroom.

“Now, man Xing was completely helpless. ”

Man Wen was already an adult. He couldn’t just grab him and beat him up.

“”Then I’ll go back first,”man Xing continued, “Think about whether what I said makes sense or not.” ”

“Not long after man Xing left, Zhao Dan walked out from the side. Looking at man Xing’s back, her eyes were a little red. ”

She came from behind man Xing.

“She knew that man Xing was a responsible elder sister. Unfortunately, Man Wen, this child, did not know what was good for him. He saw good words as evil words and did not know what was good for him at all! He only knew how to fool around All Day! She really did not know how she could give birth to such a thing with man Jiangshan! ”

It was a waste of man Xing’s good intentions.

“Thinking of this, Zhao Dan looked into the house and shook her head helplessly. After a moment, she turned around and walked back. ”
