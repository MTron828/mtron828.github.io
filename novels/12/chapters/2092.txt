“Chapter 2093: 432: The Rest of your life, unrestrained and unrestrained 3”

Translator: 549690339

“Aren’t you busy?”Zhao Dan asked.

“MAN XING said, “How is being busy more important than accompanying you?” ”

Zhao Dan’s face was full of smiles.

“Although Man Wen was unreliable, as long as man Xing was sensible. ”

On the other side.

“After Man Wen returned to his bedroom, he immediately closed the door and took out a note. ”

“After reading the note, he immediately took out his communicator. “What’s Going On?” ”

“It’s what you saw. Your eldest sister did indeed return to Earth with Ye Han.”Fan Mu’s voice came from the other side.

Return to Earth.

Man Wen frowned slightly.

Why did ye Zhuo return to earth?

“Fan Mu continued, “I now suspect that when your eldest sister disappeared, she was also on Earth.” ”

“After saying that, fan mu continued, “Old Wen, didn’t you dislike your eldest sister? It’s fine if you didn’t let her go home, but you even said such hurtful words in front of her. Now, why are you so concerned about her?” ”

“Thinking about it carefully, man Wen had indeed gone overboard at that time. ”

“Man Wen had said that he only had one sister, man Xing, in front of ye Zao, and he had even made ye Zao Give Up! ” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“It was also because ye Zao had a good temper. Ye Zao was not angry even when man Wen had shouted in front of him. If it was anyone else, they might not have such a good temper. ”

“Man Wen stood up and looked out of the window, lost in thought. After a long while, he slowly said, “The man family is not suitable for her.” ”

The man family seemed calm.

“In fact, the water in the house was very deep. ”

“He was already deeply involved in it, and it was something that could not be salvaged. He could not disgust others anymore. ”

Especially ye Zao.

Ye Zao had already suffered a lot in his early years. It was not easy for her to become famous in Chang Yue.

“For the rest of her life, she should live freely and unrestrainedly. ”

She should not live in a life of scheming and scheming.

“In the man family, there were only interests and power. Everyone wore a mask of hypocrisy, so there was no such thing as kinship. ”

The reason why he had said such words in front of ye Zhuo was just a diversion.

“On the other end of the communicator, Fan Mu sighed. “Since you care about her, why hurt her heart so much?” ”

“Man Wen continued, “I don’t regret it.” ”

Not at all.

“From the moment Zhao Dan and Man Jiangshan decided to give up on Ye Zhuo, Ye Zhuo had nothing to do with him. ”

“When they met again, they could only be strangers! ”

He did not have the right to call her sister.

“”But you were clearly doing it for her own good, yet you let her misunderstand you. For No Reason, you even got beaten up by that ye Han! Do you feel wronged? !”Fan Mu complained on behalf of her good friend. ”

“Man Wen smiled and said, “I don’t feel wronged. I owe her this.” ”

He was willing to take this beating.

“”Fan Mu,”man Wen continued, “I was too naive in the past. I always thought that she was really dead, but unfortunately... I wasn’t able to find her when she needed warmth the most.” ”

“When Man Wen found out that his eldest sister was fine and might still be alive in the world, Ye Zhuo’s name was already well-known in Chang Yue. ”

“Therefore, man Wen pretended not to know that ye Zao was the full moon. ”

He had been keeping this secret.

He did not want to disturb her.

The first person to abandon her was the man family. Ye Zao’s success was her own ability and had nothing to do with the man family. He was not qualified to call ye Zao elder sister.

Nor was he worthy.

“Knowing that Ye Zao was the full moon that had been missing for many years, man Wen went to find out about ye Zao’s growth experience. ”

“That night, he cried so much that he could not help himself. ”

“Since he was young, he had been well-fed and had never experienced such a thing. ”

According to the information.

“When Ye Zao was at his most hungry, he once killed a level three armored beast with his bare hands and ate its flesh raw to survive. ”

“At that time, Ye Zao was only ten years old. ”

“Man Wen did not know what a level three armored beast tasted like, so he specially hunted one over. ”

“After just a small bite, man Wen vomited so much that he almost vomited out his bile. ”

It was disgusting.

That kind of indescribable disgusting taste was unforgettable to man Wen.

It was simply unimaginable how the ten-year-old ye Zhuo could bear it.

“After that, for several days, Man Wen was depressed. ”

“Especially when he saw his parents talking and laughing as if nothing had happened, he couldn’t control himself even more. ”

“Hearing his good friend blame himself, fan mude felt a little uncomfortable, he continued, “Old Wen, don’t blame yourself too much! How old were you at that time! You were still a child! Even if you really found her, what use would it be?” ”

Manwen was two years younger than ye Zao.

“When Ye Zao was wandering, how old was Manwen? ”

“”I was too naive,”manwen continued, “I always thought that she was really kidnapped.” ”
