“Chapter 528: 134: continuous face slapping, large-scale true fragrance scene! 5”

Translator: 549690339

It was already surprising enough that Cen Shaoqing was willing to attend the banquet today!

“Unexpectedly, the Cen Old Lady took out a bracelet.”

“If they were not mistaken, this was a top-grade imperial jade!”

Was the Cen Old Lady backing ye Shu?

Not to mention the crowd.

Even Feng Qianhua was stunned.

Could it be that old Mrs. Cen knew ye Shu before?

But Ye Shu was just a lowly person.

How could she be worthy of knowing Old Mrs. Cen?

Or could it be.

Old Mrs. Cen was giving face to Old Mrs. Lin?

“After all, these two were close friends.”

Yes!

Old Mrs. Cen was definitely giving face to old Mrs. Lin.

Feng Qianhua was very unwilling.

“If it wasn’t for Ye Shu’s interference, the person who accepted the bracelet now wouldn’t be that slut ye Shu!”

It was ye Shu who had snatched what was rightfully hers!

Shameless!

Old Lady Lin also felt that old lady cen had done something wrong. She was really muddled!

Could it be that old lady cen could not tell that she did not like ye Shu?

Besides.

Was a b * tch like ye Shu suitable for her to use such a good thing?

“Old Lady Lin kept winking at Old Lady Cen, but Old Lady Cen acted as if she did not see it.”

“Ye Shu naturally saw that this bracelet was priceless, so she declined politely, “Thank you, Old Mrs. Cen, but this bracelet is too valuable...””

“Old Mrs. Cen pressed down on Ye Shu’s hand. “No matter how valuable it is, you deserve it.””

“Lin Jincheng was also very surprised that old Mrs. Cen liked ye Shu so much. He smiled and said, “Ah Shu, since it’s from Old Mrs. Cen, then you should keep it.””

“In Lin Jincheng’s view, Old Mrs. Cen didn’t just give him a bracelet, she gave him more recognition!”

Ye Shu smiled and thanked him.

“Lin Jincheng continued to introduce, “Old Mrs. Cen, this is my daughter, Ye Zhuo.””

“Ye Zhuo winked at Old Mrs. Cen playfully. “Hello, Grandma Cen.””

“”Good, good, good.”Old Mrs. Cen smiled so much that she couldn’t even see her eyes. She held ye Zhuo’s hand and said, “When I saw this child, I felt that it was fate. Oh right, this is a gift from Grandma to you.””

Old Mrs. Cen gave ye Zao a big red packet. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“”Thank you, Grandma Cen.””

“When Feng Xianxian saw this scene, her eyeballs almost fell out of her eyes.”

Why?

Why did ye Zao have to?

“She, the future granddaughter-in-law of the CEN family, had not even received a gift from old Mrs. Cen!”

Feng Qianhua patted Feng Xianxian’s hand.

Feng Xianxian looked at Feng Qianhua and gradually calmed down.

How could an old lady as noble as the CEN matriarch fall for a wild girl like Ye Zhuo.

“Without even thinking, she must have pretended to like ye Zhuo because of Old Lady Lin.”

“Lin Jincheng introduced Cen Shaoqing to Ye Shu. “Ah Shu, this is the CEN fifth master whose name shook the capital.””

“Although there was a gap in seniority between Lin Jincheng and Cen Shaoqing, in front of Cen Shaoqing, he had no choice but to address him as CEN fifth master.”

“After all, this person had the ability!”

“However, CEN fifth master almost caused Cen Shaoqing to fall from his chair. He quickly put down the Buddha beads and stood up with a wine glass in his hand. “Uncle Lin, Auntie Ye, I’m a junior. You two can just call me by my name.””

Lin Jincheng was stunned.

Cen Shaoqing had become famous in a single battle. He was usually stern and stern. When had he ever been so easy to talk to?

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “Shaoqing, in that case, I’ll toast to you first.””

Cen Shaoqing raised his cup.

Lin Jincheng turned to look at Ye Shu as if he did not understand why ye Shu could call Cen Shaoqing by his name so easily.

“In the entire capital, other than the Cen family, who dared to call Cen Shaoqing by his name?”

“Lin Jincheng turned to look at ye Zao. “Zao Zao, call me fifth master.””

“Ye Zao pretended as if he didn’t know Cen Shaoqing at all and said with a smile, “Fifth Master.””

Cen Shaoqing felt his bones go weak from calling him fifth master.

He simply couldn’t imagine how this person would feel if..? ... He called him fifth master?

Just thinking about it made him feel unbearable.

Cen Shaoqing interrupted the romantic thoughts in his heart and nodded slightly.

Lin Jincheng brought ye Shu and Ye Zhuo to meet the others.

“When they passed by Cen Shaoqing, Ye Zhuo reached out and pinched his waist.”

It was a little itchy.

“Cen Shaoqing did not expect her to do this. His breathing stopped and it was as if something in his body was ignited. When he looked back, he had already walked to the other table with Lin Jincheng.”

This ancestor...

“In order to avoid being noticed, Cen Shaoqing picked up the ice water on the table and drank it in one gulp.”
