“Mom.”Ye Shu took off her scarf.

“Old Lady Lin asked impatiently, “Ah Shu, how was it? Did you see her?” ”

“I saw her.”Ye Shu nodded.

“How was she?”Old Lady Lin asked impatiently.

“Ye Shu frowned slightly. “I don’t know what to say either. She looks okay, but after all, we haven’t been together before, so I don’t know her background. Also, burning didn’t seem to be satisfied with her.” ”

“”Zhuoluo isn’t satisfied?”Old Lady Lin continued to ask, “What did Zhuoluo Say?” ”

“Ye Shu continued, “From what Zhuoluo said, it seems like she suspects that the child in her stomach isn’t Ah Ze’s. When I went there, she was making a fuss about aborting the child!” ”

“Hearing this, Old Lady Lin frowned, and the joy of having a great-grandson disappeared completely. ”

“Ye Zao would not have any problems seeing the sunlight. If ye Zao was doubting the child’s background, then there must be something wrong with the child. ”

“”Then don’t admit it yet! We can’t let Ah Ze suffer this loss!”Old Lady Lin continued, “Call Zao right now and ask him what’s going on! We Can’t let a bastard ruin the Lin family’s Bloodline!” ”

Old Mrs. Lin’s words were rough but not harsh.

“Ye Shu said, “I’ve just called, but burning’s phone can’t be connected. She should be busy right now! I’ll ask again when she comes back tonight.” ”

“”Yes.”Old Mrs. Lin continued, “There are some young ladies nowadays who don’t think about how to change themselves. They only think about beautiful things and cling to the powerful!” ”

“Ye langhua continued, “Didn’t you say that the young lady, Lizi, also knows her? Ah Shu, have you asked Lizi about the situation?” ”

Ye Shu nodded. “I’ve asked. Lizi said that there’s nothing wrong with her character. She’s still a very caring young lady.”

“Old Lady Lin said, “Let’s wait for searing to come back first.” ”

“Compared to an Lizi, Old Lady Lin still believed in ye searing. ”

“Ye Zao was, after all, her biological granddaughter! ”

“Ever since the incident with Feng Xianxian, old madam Lin only believed in family ties. No matter how good an outsider was, they always had someone else’s blood flowing in them. ”

“Ye langhua nodded and continued, “Why don’t we call Ah Ze over to ask him?” ”

Zhang Qingqing said that Lin Ze was the father of the child.

No one should know more about what was going on than Lin Ze.

“Ye Shu said, “I’ll go get him.” ”

Upstairs.

“In the quiet room, only the clacking of keyboards could be heard. ”

Ye Shu stood outside the door and knocked.

“In a moment, Lin Ze’s voice came from inside. “Come in, the door isn’t locked.” ” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Ye Shu pushed the door open and went in.

“It had only been a night, but when Ye Shu looked at Lin Ze, she felt that Lin Ze had changed quite a bit. ”

“It was as if the bright stars had suddenly lost their luster, and it made her heart ache. ”

“It seemed that Zhang Qingqing’s pregnancy did not bring joy to Lin Ze, but a burden. ”

“”Ah Ze, what’s wrong? Are you not feeling well?”As a mother, seeing her child like this, Ye Shu was a little anxious. ”

“”It’s nothing.”Lin Ze shook his head. “Mom, why are you looking for me?” ”

“Ye Shu continued, “Your grandmother and grandmother have something to ask you.” ”

“Okay.”Lin Ze nodded. He stood up from his chair and followed ye Shu downstairs.

“Soon, the mother and son arrived downstairs. ”

“Seeing Lin ze like this, Ye Langhua and old Mrs. Lin frowned slightly. ”

“”Ah Ze, good boy. Did Your Father Scold You?”Old Mrs. Lin held Lin Ze’s hand. ”

“Lin Ze smiled and shook his head. “No. Grandma, I’m Fine.” ”

“Hearing Lin Ze say that she was fine, old Mrs. Lin heaved a sigh of relief, then, she said, “It’s good that you’re fine. Good Child. Tell me and your grandmother what happened between you and that Zhang Qingqing. Are you sure that the child in her belly is yours?” ”

“It’s mine.”Lin Ze nodded.

“”Is she your girlfriend? Are you really in love with her?”Old Mrs. Lin felt that something was wrong with Lin Ze, back then, Lin Jincheng and Ye Shu were also pregnant out of wedlock. However, all she could see on Lin Jincheng’s face was joy. However, there was no joy on Lin Ze’s face. ”

“Lin Ze did not know how to reply to Old Mrs. Lin. He continued, “Grandma, don’t worry. I will definitely be responsible for her.” ”

“Tell Grandma honestly. was that woman plotting against you?”Old Mrs. Lin asked.

Lin Ze didn’t say anything.

“”Say it! You Child!”Seeing that he didn’t say anything, Old Mrs. Lin was very anxious. ”

“Lin Ze continued, “We were all drunk at that time. When we woke up the next day, everything that should have happened had already happened.” ”
