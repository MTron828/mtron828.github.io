“Mrs. Duanmu held Duanmu Fengyu’s hand and said softly, “Fengyu, as long as you can successfully take that position and continue the glory of the Duanmu family, all of this is nothing.” ”

“At such a time, Duanmu Fengyu could do nothing but suck up to her. ”

“”Mom, I can’t take this lying down.” ”

Duanmu Fengyu was used to being number one at all times. She didn’t want anyone to overshadow her.

“Therefore, when she saw ye Zhuo’s face, she only thought of two words. ”

Destruction.

“”Mom knows,”Mrs. Duanmu continued, “But now is not the time to make a move. Have you forgotten your aunt’s warning? It’s never too late for a gentleman to take revenge.” ”

“Duanmu Huangfei did not strike when it was time to strike, and he was too impulsive when it was not. That was why he was in this situation. ”

“”You can’t follow in your aunt’s footsteps,”Mrs. Duanmu added. ”

“Upon hearing this, Duanmu Fengyu had no choice but to swallow her anger. ”

“At this moment, Duanmu Liangchen continued, “I’ll bring the two of you to greet the old lady.” ” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Okay.”Mrs. Duanmu nodded.

“The mother and daughter followed Duanmu Liangchen’s footsteps. The three of them went up to the old lady. “Hello, Old Lady. I’m Duanmu Liangchen. This is my wife, Xu Jingzhi. This is my daughter, Duanmu Fengyu.” ”

“OH.”The old lady glanced at him. “You’re the brother of that Mistress.”

Mistress!

Who Did she say was the mistress?

Who was the mistress!

Duanmu Fengyu’s eyes were about to burst into flames.

What was this pious old woman saying?

“Seeing that Duanmu Fengyu was about to go berserk, Mrs. Duanmu pulled her back without batting an eyelid. ”

“From the time Cen Haifeng had taken Old Mrs. Cen from Earth, one could tell how much he valued his mother, old Mrs. Cen. ”

“If Duanmu Fengyu were to do anything out of the ordinary at this time, she would never be able to marry Cen Shaoqing again! ”

“Duanmu Liangchen’s expression did not change. He smiled and said, “Old Lady, you misunderstand. My sister, she...” ”

“”Oh, she’s your sister, right?”Old Lady Cen Interrupted Duanmu Liangchen, “To be able to raise such a daughter, it can be seen that your Duanmu family’s traditions are not that great! “Don’t tell me that your sister is innocent, your sister is also a victim! “I, this unfilial son of yours, was cast a forbidden spell by you and forgot everything. Could it be that your sister doesn’t know that he has a wife and children on earth? “It’s immoral to interfere even when you know that the other party has a family and children. Tell me, if your sister isn’t a mistress, then what is she?” ”

“Although Old Mrs. Cen was old, her thinking was not muddle-headed. ”

Duanmu Liangchen wanted to trick her?

Difficult!

Duanmu Liangchen’s expression did not change.

“Old Mrs. Cen snorted and continued, “But she’s a mistress, and she still wants to clear her name in front of me? Do you really think I’m Old and muddle-headed? Let me tell you, in my heart, Zhou Xiang will always be the only daughter-in-law of the Cen Family!” ”

“”You’re right,”Duanmu Liangchen continued, “But the national system is like this. My Sister is only following the path of her life.” ”

What was wrong with Duanmu Fenghuang Fei?

Which daughter of the Duanmu family did not walk down this path?

It was the same in all the dynasties. How could duanmu Fenghuang Fei be blamed!

This old lady was too unreasonable!

“”You mean, for the sake of the national system that you speak of, you don’t even want etiquette, justice, and shame?”Old Mrs. Cen asked back. ”

“Duanmu Liangchen wanted to say something else, mrs. Duanmu continued, “Old Mrs. Duanmu, please calm down. If my husband has said anything wrong, I will apologize to you. All the mistakes are our fault. “As the old saying goes, if the monarch wants the subject to die, the subject has to die. Our Duanmu family has been loyal for generations. We are definitely not a crafty family. Please rest assured about this.” ”

“As soon as she finished speaking, Mrs. Duanmu looked at duanmu Feng and said, “Feng and Yu, come over and greet the old madam.” ”

“Duanmu Feng and Yu’er smiled and greeted old Madam Cen. “Nice to meet you, Old Madam.” ”

“Old Madam Cen only wanted to close the door and settle the matter with Cen Hai Feng. In addition, she had just alighted from the aircraft, so she was a little dizzy. She couldn’t be bothered to deal with these messy people, so she nodded casually. ”

“For a moment, Duanmu Fengyu could not figure out what old Mrs. Cen meant. ”

Mrs. Duanmu gestured for Duanmu Fengyu to call Zhou Xiang.

“Duanmu fengyu immediately understood and turned to look at Zhou Xiang. “Hello, Auntie.” ”

“Although Zhou Xiang did not know Duanmu Fengyu’s identity, she could vaguely guess it. She nodded and said, “Hello.” ”

Duanmu fengyu sized up Zhou Xiang and felt that Zhou Xiang was not as shrewd as Mrs. Duanmu had described.
