Translator: 549690339

“[ if it were me, I would be scared too! Dr. Warne, Dr. Millet, and the Feiyu team, which one of them isn’t a big shot among the big shots? ] ”

“[ Ah Ah Ah! If I’m not mistaken, the one standing next to Dr. Millet is the Dark Horse of the last science and technology competition, right? ] ”

[ oh my God! What kind of God combination is this! ]

“”To be able to see this scene in my lifetime, my life is worth it!” ”

“Worth it! Worth It!”

“”Ah, I’m crying! I regret not recording it just now!” ”

“”Brother upstairs, don’t worry, I’ve recorded it.” ”

“”Brother, add me as a friend!” ”

“Add me as a friend!”

“Add me as a friend + 1”

“+ 10086”

“In front of the camera, ye Zao turned around slightly, looked at everyone, and bowed slowly. “Thank you to everyone standing behind me today!” ”

It had always been easier to add flowers to the icing on the cake than to send charcoal in the snow. Ye Zao would never forget this moment.

“Dr. Millet quickly walked forward and helped ye Zao up, “Dr. YC, we should be the ones thanking you. We have witnessed your ability. We believe that even without our participation, you can still lead the original team members to complete the aircraft carrier project!” ”

The rest of the words were already self-evident.

[ Dr. Millet is so kind! ]

“[ this means that leaf is amazing! If leaf didn’t know anything, would Dr. Millet still be like this? ] ”

“The reporters below the stage also reacted at this time. They handed the microphone to Dr. Millet and asked, “Dr. Millet, have you seen Dr. YC’s design before?” ”

“”Not yet,”Dr. Millet said honestly. ”

“”As far as I know, the top experts from more than 200 countries around the world have gathered together but have yet to develop an aircraft carrier. Do you trust her that much?” ”

“I heard that Dr. YC is also a student of Beijing University!”

“Dr. Millet held the microphone in front of him, then, he said, “Age is not equal to strength!”! Ganluo, a 12-year-old official who became a high official. Li He, a 6-year-old who can recite poems and write a couplet. Cai Wenji, a 4-year-old who can tune himself. The founder of Taoism, Lao Zi, who talks about misfortune and fortune at the age of 10! This reporter comrade, I see that your hair is not short either. Why Can’t your knowledge be longer? Remember to read more when you have time.” ”

“As soon as he said this, Cen Jiang took the lead in clapping. ”

“Then, the audience instantly erupted in applause. ”

“At this moment, a microphone was placed in front of ye Zao, “Dr. YC, is the ‘two-year period’that was posted all over the internet true? Can you really lead the research team to build an aircraft carrier to land on the eight planets within two years?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“The reporter continued, “Then what if your aircraft carrier project is not successfully completed after the two-year period?” ”

“Ye Zhuo looked at the camera and said, “If it’s not successfully completed, then what kind of doctor would I be? Besides... is it difficult to build an aircraft carrier?” ”

Is it difficult? Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

It’s not difficult to build an aircraft carrier? !

This sentence seemed to be a little arrogant!

“If building an aircraft carrier was really that easy, then C country, which was known as the most technologically advanced country, would not have been unable to develop an aircraft carrier until now. ”

“At this moment, the bullet screen was filled with the words ‘666666’. ”

Ye Zao dialed the microphone. “Do you have any other questions?”

“”Dr. YC, may I ask who gave you the confidence to be so confident?” ”

“Confidence is such a thing.”Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly. “Do you still need others to give it to you?”

Tang Xue looked at Ye Zao on the stage and narrowed her eyes slightly.

“Ruth walked over and handed Tang Xue a cigarette. “Sister Xue, don’t tell me you really believe that ye Zao can build an aircraft carrier?” ”

“She’s too confident.”Tang Xue lit the cigarette.

“Ruth said, “This is called overconfidence.” ”

What was overconfidence called?

Overconfidence!

“In more than 200 countries around the world, tens of thousands of top scientific and technological experts had yet to develop an aircraft carrier. What right did ye Zao have? ”

What right did she have to brag?

“Ruth continued, “Sister Xue, don’t worry. Ye Zao will definitely not end well.” ”

Tang Xue took a puff of her cigarette.

“After the press conference ended, Ye Zao brought everyone to the laboratory to analyze the plan for the aircraft carrier. ”

Ye Zao stood in front of the conference table. Behind her was a huge screen.

“The background on the screen was a vast and boundless starry sky, and there was a huge flying object hovering in the starry sky. ”

It made people’s scalps go numb just by looking at it!

“Liu Hao, the captain of the Feiyu team, couldn’t help but stand up and suppress the shock in his heart. “Father Ye, is this the space mothership?” ”

“Yes.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Liu Hao continued, “Can you see the internal structure from this picture?” ”
