“Chapter 1242: 259: the entire Internet explodes in anger, Zhao Xueyin is being abused! 5”

“She took five full showers before the stench on her body was completely washed away. Although it had all been washed away, Zhao Xueyin still felt that there was a faint stench on her body. ”

“Stop!”

Father Zhao’s furious voice sounded from behind.

“”Dad, I have to go to the law firm now! If there’s anything, we’ll talk about it when I Come Back Tonight!”She must bring those who threw rotten eggs and spat at her and ye Zao to Justice! ”

“I told you to stop right there!”Father Zhao walked directly to Zhao Xueyin.

“What’s Wrong?”Zhao Xueyin turned to look at Father Zhao.

“Father Zhao continued, “Let me ask you, who did you offend? and whose cat is that?” ”

“”Ye Zao’s,”Zhao Xueyin said. ”

“If it wasn’t for ye Zao, she wouldn’t have been thrown rotten eggs today. ”

Now that he thought about it.

Those reporters must have been ye Zao who had asked someone to impersonate her.

“If it were not for the reporters coming to interview her, she would not have gone out! ”

“Hearing this, Father Zhao was instantly shocked. ”

So it was ye Zao’s cat.

No wonder this matter was getting more and more popular!

It was obvious that ye Zao was behind this matter.

Zhao Xueyin was no match for ye Zao at all.

“Otherwise, she would not have lost so many battles! ”

“However, Zhao Xueyin did not learn her lesson. She always liked to provoke ye Zao. ” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Idiot!”Father Zhao raised his hand and slapped Zhao Xueyin’s face. “Who told you to Touch Ye Zao’s Cat?”

“There were many things. If there was a first time, there would be a second and third time. ”

“In the past, Father Zhao never hit Zhao Xueyin. Now, a slap was a common occurrence! ”

“Zhao Xueyin did not expect father Zhao to hit her. She covered her face and said, “Isn’t it just a cat? Do you have to be like this?” ”

Killing a cat was not killing a person!

“Could it be that in her father’s heart, she was not even as good as a cat? ”

“”Isn’t it just a cat? Don’t tell me that you haven’t caused enough trouble!”Father Zhao said angrily, “Because of the cat that you tortured to death, now the entire Zhao family will be implicated because of this!” ”

The entire Zhao family will be implicated?

How was that possible!

Could it be that ye Zhuo could still make a move against the Zhao family?

“Zhao Xueyin continued, “Ye Zhuo doesn’t have any evidence to prove that I killed that cat!” ”

“As long as she didn’t admit it, who could force her to admit it? ”

Ye Zhoneng?

“No evidence? No evidence!”Father Zhao was so angry that he laughed. “Go and look at the Yue le news yourself!”

News?

Could it be the ones that the reporters had taken just now?

Weren’t they the fake reporters that ye Zhuo had found?

“When she thought about how she looked like she had just been thrown an egg and had been uploaded to the news website, Zhao Xueyin’s face turned pale. ”

Zhao Xueyin took out her phone and opened happy reading news. A trending video popped up.

“On the video, there was a woman who was peeling a cat’s skin with a dagger in her hand. She had a ferocious look on her face. It was her! ”

The number of reposts exceeded ten million.

“The number of comments was already 2,000,000 + . ”

The popularity of the video even surpassed that of a celebrity’s wedding.

“Furthermore, the video had been synchronized to Weibo and other social media platforms. ”

Zhao Xueyin’s face was pale and her blood was flowing backwards.

She originally thought that the video of her being thrown a rotten egg had been uploaded to the Internet.

She did not expect that it was this...

How did this video come about?

“Although there were surveillance cameras in Zhao Xueyin’s office, the surveillance cameras were all encrypted. Without her consent, no one could view them! ”

It was precisely because others could not view the surveillance cameras that Zhao Xueyin dared to make a move in her office.

“However, Zhao Xueyin never expected that the surveillance cameras would actually leak out! ”

How did these videos come about?

No wonder there were reporters waiting for her.

No wonder those people threw rotten eggs at her!

Zhao Xueyin’s back was covered in layers of cold sweat.

What to do...

What to do now...

It was not a good thing to stir up public anger.

Ye Zao!

It was all ye Zao!

These were all ye Zao’s methods.

Wasn’t it just a cat?

“If this cat died, couldn’t she raise another one? ”

Did Ye Zao have to force her into a corner?

B * Tch!

“This B * Tch, Ye Zao, was clearly using this as an excuse to make use of the cat’s matter to seek revenge. ”

Zhao Xueyin’s eyes were filled with hatred.

“At this moment, a servant carried a large package in. “Miss, your express delivery.” ”

Zhao Xueyin was immersed in her own world.

“”Just leave it there,”father Zhao said. ”

“The servant continued, “The Courier said that it’s very important inside. You must let miss personally check and accept it. Miss, please check and accept it.” ”

Only then did Zhao Xueyin react. She walked outside and began to open the express delivery with scissors.
