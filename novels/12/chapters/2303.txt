Translator: 549690339

“Ye Sen rubbed his chin and narrowed his eyes. “I remember that the last time burning did this, it was because he found a boyfriend. Do you think that Ah Ze has found a girlfriend?” ”

“”If that’s really the case, then it’s really big news.”After saying that, ye Langhua turned to look at Ye Sen, then, she said, “Don’t talk about Ah Ze all the time. I don’t know when you, as an uncle, will be able to solve your personal life-long problem.” ”

“”Don’t worry, don’t worry.”Ye Sen smiled and said, “I promise to solve this problem within this year.” ”

“Ye Sen had just expressed his feelings to Gu dening not long ago, but the time had not come yet, so it was not suitable for him to announce it yet. ”

“”That’s good. Ah Sen, it’s time for you to solve your life-long problem!”Ye Langhua said. ”

“Not long after, Ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing also returned. ”

“Ye Shu even went to the north wing to invite Old Lady Lin. No matter what happened in the past, Old Lady Lin was Lin Ze’s grandmother after all. Moreover, Old Lady Lin had received her due retribution for what happened to Lin Ze, old Lady Lin also had the right to know. ”

One must always look forward.

“At night, the Lin family sat at the dining table. ”

“Old Lady Lin looked at her family, and her eyes were slightly red. There was not a day that she did not regret her previous actions. Unfortunately, there were all kinds of medicine in this world, but there was no medicine for regret. ”

She was really grateful to Ye Shu.

“Old Lady Lin raised her glass. “This glass of wine is for Ah Shu. Ah Shu, thank you. I Won’t say anymore. Everything is in this glass of wine.” ”

Ye Shu immediately stood up with the glass in her hand.

Old Lady Lin downed the wine in the glass in one gulp.

Ye Shu did not say anything and also drank the wine in one gulp.

“Just as Old Lady Lin said, everything was in the wine. ”

“After ye Shu sat down, Lin Jincheng held her hand and said in a low voice, “Thank you, Ah Shu.” ”

“”No need to thank me,”ye Shu continued, “If your mother hadn’t changed, the current situation wouldn’t have happened.” ”

“At this moment, Ye Sen looked at Lin Ze and continued, “AH ze, didn’t you say that you have something very important to announce to all of us? Why haven’t You Said Anything?” ”

“”That’s right, Ah Ze. Quickly tell us what it is!”Ye Langhua followed up. ”

“Lin Ze put down his chopsticks and said solemnly, “Father, mother, grandmother, grandmother, uncle, Zhuo Zhuo, fifth brother, I have a girlfriend.” ” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Although Cen Shaoqing was ye Zhuo’s boyfriend now, Cen Shaoqing was still older than him, so Lin Ze had always called CEN Shaoqing fifth brother. ”

Had a girlfriend?

The dining table was quiet for a few seconds before ye Sen’s laughter broke the silence. “So you really have a girlfriend! Your grandmother and I were discussing this in the afternoon! You two siblings are exactly the same!”

“Lin Ze smiled embarrassedly. Ye Shu immediately asked, “Ah Ze, whose girl is that? Do I know her? What’s her character like?” ”

“Lin Jincheng was also very concerned about these questions. He immediately listened carefully, afraid that he would miss a word. ”

“Lin Ze maintained his mysteriousness. He looked up at ye Shu and said, “It’s a secret for now, but I’ll invite her to my house the day after tomorrow.” ”

“The day after tomorrow?”Ye Sen asked.

“Yes.”Lin Ze nodded.

“Ye Sen took out his phone and sent a voice message to his assistant. “Xiao Chen, cancel all my trips the day after tomorrow.” ”

“Lin Ze looked up at Ye Sen and smiled. “Uncle, if you’re too busy, you don’t have to come back. There will be plenty of opportunities for us to meet in the future anyway.” ”

“”That won’t do. The first time we meet is very important. We can’t let the woman feel that we’ve neglected her.”Although ye Sen had never been married, he still had a set of principles. ”

“Because Lin ze was going to bring Bai Jingshu to meet the parents the day after tomorrow, Ye Langhua decided not to go back. She stayed over at the Lin family’s house for the night. ”

“Old Lady Lin held ye Langhua’s hand. “Langhua, can I Talk to You?” ”

“Ye Langhua was stunned for a moment, then said, “Okay. Where shall we go to talk?” ”

“”Let’s go to my north room,”said Old Lady Lin. ”

“Okay.”

Ye Langhua stood up and walked over to the servant. “Let me push it.”

The servant looked at Old Lady Lin with some embarrassment. “Old Lady?”

“Old Lady Lin smiled and said, “You can go home first.” ”

“Upon hearing that she could go home early, the servant said happily, “Thank you, Old Lady. I’ll be going home first!” ”

“Go home.”Old Lady Lin waved her hand.
