“Ye Zhuo continued, “Oh right, after teacher Wei found out that you liked him, he asked me to bring you a gift.” ”

“Gift? What Gift?”Li Yueyue’s eyes were about to sparkle.

Ye Zhuo took out a gift box. “Take a look for yourself.”

“Li Yueyue took the gift box. After opening it, she found that there was a cup inside. ”

The cup reflected Wei Xingzhi’s poster and his autograph.

“Li Yueyue held the cup and kissed it a few times. “Ahhh! I’m so excited now! I want to take photos, I want to post them on wechat moments! I want to post them to the group of people who love each other!” ”

“”Da Zhuozhu, you’re practically my closest relative!” ”

“At the end of her sentence, Li Yueyue hugged ye Zhuozhu tightly again. ”

“Ye zhuozhuo smiled and said, “Hurry up and go take some photos.” ”

“”Yes, yes, yes! I have to hurry up and take some photos!”Li Yueyue took a few photos in a row and sent them to every group before sharing them on her moments. ”

“Wei Xingzhi was a capable celebrity and there were quite a number of people who liked him. In addition to the explosive popularity of ‘country’last year, Li Yueyue received more than 200 likes in a short while. ”

“Li Yueyue looked at ye Zao. “Da Zao, can I visit you when you’re filming the second episode of ‘country’?” ”

Ye Zao nodded. “I should be able to.”

“Li Yueyue was extremely excited and said with a smile, “Then when you’re filming the second episode, I’ll visit you.” ”

“Sure.”Ye Zao turned on his computer.

“After staying on the set for a week, she had not been doing any serious business for a week. ”

“When she turned on her computer, all sorts of messages took up almost the entire computer screen. ”

Ye Zao replied slowly.

“Li Yueyue continued to ask, “Great Zao, when will the latest season of ‘Country’be broadcast?” ”

“Ye Zao’s fingers quickly tapped on the keyboard. “According to the director, it should be in a week, but the exact time has not been decided yet. We Still Have to see the SARFT’s approval.” ”

“”OH.”Li Yueyue nodded. “That should be soon. When that time comes, I must stay in front of the television.” ”

“The next day, there were no classes in the morning. ”

Ye Zao arranged a small gathering with Zhao Pingting and an Lizi.

Zhao Pingting and an Lizi both liked Chang Yu very much.

“Therefore, ye Zao specially asked for an autographed photo of Chang Yu. ”

The two of them were extremely happy.

“Zhao pingting smiled and said, “Zao, are you going to become a big star in the future?” ”

“Ye Zao shook his head. “I’m just going to participate in a reality show. I have no intention of debuting as a star.”If it were not for the sake of saving a sum of endorsement fees to buy desserts, ye Zao would not have gone to participate in a variety show. ”

“However, after participating in ‘The Village’, Ye Zao found this variety show quite interesting. ”

“The air in the village was good, the food was fresh, and there were all kinds of wild fruits to eat. Most importantly, there was a tractor that could be driven. ”

“An lizi continued, “I heard that song Chenyu is also a permanent guest on this episode?” ”

Ye Zhuo nodded. “It’s true.”

“Is song Chenyu in person good to watch? I heard that she and Chang Yu are dating. Is that true?”An Lizi continued to ask.

“Song Chenyu and Chang Yu had worked together before, and after that, there were rumors of an ambiguous relationship. Many people were fans of their relationship. ”

“However, ever since the popularity of that television drama went down, there were no more scandals between the two of them. ”

An Lizi was also a fan of their relationship.

“”It’s fake news,”ye Zhuo’s tone was indifferent. “The two of them basically did not communicate much on the program team.” ”

“Hearing that, an Lizi’s face was filled with disappointment. “So it’s fake! I was wondering why there was no news from the two of them for a long time!” ”

“Zhao pingting said, “It’s fine if it’s fake. I feel that Song Chenyu doesn’t Deserve Changyu!” ”

“An lizi whimpered, “I really like their looks.” ”

“In the blink of an eye, another three days passed. ”

Today was the day of the Chinese art world’s presidential election.

Ye Zhuo had received an invitation from Old Lady Cen half a month ago to participate in the Chinese art world’s art exhibition.

“At eight o’clock in the morning, Ye Zhuo drove over to pick up Old Lady Cen. ”

“When she arrived, Old Mrs. Cen was already waiting at the door. ”

Old Mrs. Cen was wearing a light-colored qipao. Her silver-white hair was tied up at the back of her head and was fixed by a wooden hairpin.

She had an elegant temperament.

It reminded one of a saying.

“Old Mrs. Cen had been a great beauty when she was young. Although she was already in her eighties, the temperament in her bones was still there. This temperament could not be erased no matter how much wind and rain she had been through. ”

“Seeing ye Zao come over, Old Mrs. Cen waved at her excitedly. “Yezi.” ”
