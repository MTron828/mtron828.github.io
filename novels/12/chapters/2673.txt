There were seven or eight children in the house. Everyone was talking to each other. Ye Zhuo did not know who to answer.

“Huanhuan was the older child among the children. She continued, “If aunt gets married, she won’t be able to stay at home anymore. We definitely won’t be able to see aunt in the future.” ”

“Duan Duan and Rui Rui heard this and immediately hugged ye Zhuo. “Aunt, then don’t get married, okay!” ”

“”Aunt, don’t get married!” ”

“Uncle is bad! I don’t like Uncle Anymore!”

“Surrounded by a group of children, Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “Okay, okay, okay. Aunt Won’t get married anymore.” ”

“Having said that, how could cen Shaoqing still sit still, he smiled and said, “Don’t worry, you kids. I’m married to your aunt, so you can still see her. Not only can you see her, but you’ll also have another person who likes you in the future.” ”

“Who is it?”Huanhuan asked.

“CEN Shaoqing said, “Of course it’s your uncle.” ”

“Huanhuan thought for a moment and asked, “Who’s your uncle?” ”

“Cen Shaoqing opened his thin lips and said, “When your aunt and uncle get married, I’ll be your uncle in the future. I’ll like you more than your aunt.” ”

“Really?”Huanhuan asked.

“”Of course.”Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly and continued, “Huanhuan, do you like Princess Elsa?” ”

“Yes.”Huanhuan nodded.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “I can invite Princess Elsa over and play games with you.” ”

“Really?”Huanhuan’s face was full of surprise.

“”Of course it’s true,”Cen Shaoqing said. ”

“”Thank you, uncle,”Huanhuan said excitedly. ”

“Although Huanhuan was a boy, she liked Princess Elsa and Snow White since she was young. Her personality was very much like a girl’s. ”

“Cen Shaoqing looked at the other children. “Duan Rui Rui Rui, do you like Ultraman?” ”

“”Yes, yes, yes!” ”

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Then I can invite Ultraman to my house.” ”

“Then can I ask Dijia to come over?”Duan Duan asked.

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“”Uncle, we like Armored Warriors!” ”

“Cen Shaoqing opened his thin lips slightly. “The idol uncle that you like can invite over for you. However, uncle has a condition.” ”

“What Condition?”The children immediately asked.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “You have to be obedient.” ”

“”Okay, okay, okay.”. ”

The children were very cooperative with Cen Shaoqing.

He took less than ten minutes to subdue the children’s hearts. Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly.

This person was really not an ordinary black-bellied person.

The children did not Pester ye Zao anymore. Cen Shaoqing finally had time to sit beside ye Zao. “How is it? Am I Powerful?”

“Powerful!”Ye Zao nodded slightly.

“”I also think that I’m very good.”Cen Shaoqing twirled the Buddhist beads, and the corners of his mouth curled up. “But what’s the use of that? I’m so good, but I still fell under your skirt.” ”

Ye Zao Laughed Lightly. “Glib tongue.”

“”Every word is sincere.”Cen Shaoqing’s eyes were serious, and he continued, “Zao Zao, I’m now looking forward to the time passing faster every day.” ”

“Why?”Ye searing asked.

“CEN Shaoqing continued, “Because that way, we can skip the middle of the time and go straight to the day of our wedding.” ”

Cen Shaoqing did not have much of a concept of time in the past. This period of time was simply like a year.

“He wanted time to pass faster, but every day was so slow. ”

“Ye searing stood up and smiled, “Don’t think about those impossible things. Let’s go out and take a look.” ”

There were many guests in the house today. It was not good for them to keep hiding upstairs like this.

Cen Shaoqing stood up as well.

The two of them went outside.

The Cen family’s relatives had almost arrived.

The hall was very lively inside and outside.

“”Burning!”At this moment, ye Zhuo’s shoulder was patted by someone. ”

Ye Zhuo looked back slightly. It was an Lizi.

“Lizi.”

“An lizi smiled and said, “What are the two of you doing hiding in the room? We’ve been looking for you for a long time, but we still haven’t Found You.” ”

“”Nothing much,”ye Zao said. ”

An Lizi smiled evilly. “Really nothing much?”

“”Really nothing much,”ye Zao said. ”

“An lizi continued, “I don’t believe it.” ” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Cen Shaoqing answered at this moment. He opened his thin lips and said, “What do you and your friends usually do in the room? What did searing and I do in the room just now?” ”

“An Lizi almost stuttered. She did not expect Cen Shaoqing to be so lethal. “I, I, I, we usually do nothing!” ”
