Kevin was very angry now. It was because there were many people like Mi Jia Di who were afraid of both the east and the west that country C had come to this point.

“If Mi Jia Di had been a little more daring, he would not have wasted so much time. ”

“At the end of the sentence.., kevin added, “The withered plants are real, the dead small animals are real, and the fact that Mars turned into a desert overnight is also real! If ye Zao was acting, would she have paid such a huge price?” ”

“Hearing Kevin’s words, Mi Jia Di began to consider whether he was really wrong. ”

He didn’t think too much!

“Just as Kevin said, no one would lift a rock to hit their own feet, and ye Zao would not take such a risk. ”

“If he missed this opportunity, he would never have such an opportunity in the future. ”

“After a while, he looked at Kevin and said, “Send me everything that Wen Zhi has sent you these past few days.”He needed to verify the authenticity before he could decide whether to sign the bet agreement. ”

“Okay.”Kevin nodded.

“Very soon, Kevin sent the documents to Mi Jia Di. ”

Mi Jia Di’s ability was not to be underestimated since she had reached her current position. She studied the information that Wen Zhi had sent over during this period of time.

Kevin was standing opposite Mi Jia Di.

“After a moment, Mi Jia Di looked up. “You can go out first. I’ll call you when I’m done.” ”

“Okay.”Kevin nodded.

“After around three hours, Mi Jia di finally finished appraising all the information. Finally, she came to a conclusion that all the information was true. ”

Mi Jia Di immediately contacted Kevin.

“Kevin also arrived very quickly. “Doctor, have you finished reading it?” ”

Mi Jia di nodded. “You’re right. We only have one chance. We should go and draft a betting agreement right away to take back what belongs to us!” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“After saying that, mi jia di added, “After you’ve drafted the agreement, send it to me immediately. I’ll bring it up to the higher-ups to apply for approval.” ”

“Kevin smiled and said, “Alright! I’ll go right away!” ”

“Because he had already prepared for it, Kevin quickly drew up the betting agreement and returned to MI Jiadi’s office. ”

“”Doctor, please take a look.” ”

“Mi Jiadi took the agreement and said with some hesitation, “There’s nothing wrong with the agreement. I just don’t know if YC will sign it.” ”

“Now that the OASIS project had failed, unless ye Zhuo was a fool, ye Zhuo would not sign such a betting agreement. ”

“”Don’t worry, Wenzhi is here.”Kevin continued, “Once YC signs this agreement, we will immediately make a preemptive move and immediately announce this news to the International Community!” ”

“Okay.”Mi Jiadi nodded. “Tell Wenzhi to be careful.”

“If they were discovered, all their efforts would be for naught. ”

“Okay.”

“Kevin sent the electronic version of the proposed agreement to Wenzhi. After Wenzhi received the documents, he immediately printed them out. ”

Two copies in a row.

Now he just needed to stamp and sign these two documents.

Wen Zhi held the documents and narrowed his eyes.

What method should he think of to get ye Zhuo to sign them?

“At this moment, footsteps came from outside the door. ”

It was Yu Zifei who had returned.

Wen Zhi immediately placed the printed documents under a pile of documents and pretended that nothing had happened as he began to work.

“Yu Zifei entered the door, his face full of anxiety. “Xiao Wen, go get me a glass of water.” ”

“Okay.”Wen Zhi put down the work in his hands and got up to pour water for Yu Zifei.

“In a moment, he walked to Yu Zifei’s side with a glass of water. “Here’s your water.” ”

“Yu Zifei took the water. “Oh right, bring the documents that were organized yesterday to Miss Ye to sign. I’ll take a nap first. You can call me after half an hour.” ”

“Because of the sudden accident in the oasis project plan, Yu Zifei and the others were drawing up an emergency plan and had not slept for two days. ”

“Wen Zhi nodded and said, “Alright, Hurry up and take a rest.” ”

Yu Zifei drank a big gulp of water and leaned on the table to take a nap.

“Looking at the exhausted Yu Zifei, Wen Zhi smiled. ”

Idiot!

He didn’t know how someone like Yu Zifei became the team leader.

Wen Zhi slowed down his footsteps and mixed the BET agreement with the documents that he had organized yesterday. He took it to Ye Zhuo’s office.

Ye Zhuo was so busy right now that he definitely didn’t have time to check the documents one by one.

Even God was helping him!

“After Wen Zhi organized all the documents, he walked towards ye Zhuo’s office. ”
