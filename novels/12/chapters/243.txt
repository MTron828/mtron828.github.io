“”Sorry, I didn’t bring my phone.”Ye Zao declined tactfully. ”

“When Yang Yue heard this, he knew that he had no chance. ”

His footsteps immediately slowed down.

“Ye Zao had just walked out of the exam hall when he saw the backs of Ye Sen and ye Shu among the group of parents who were escorting the exam. He hurriedly jogged over. “Mom, uncle, didn’t I tell you not to wait for me? Why didn’t you go back?” ”

It was June and the Sun was scorching hot. Ye Sen and Ye Shu were sweating profusely from the heat and their skin was red from the Sun.

“Ye Shu and Ye Sen were extremely happy to see ye Zao. They even forgot about the heat. “Zao Zao, how did you do?” ”

Ye Zao nodded. “I did well. The questions were quite simple.”

“At this moment, a microphone was passed to Ye Zao’s mouth. “Hello, this student. I’m a reporter from the Yun Jing television station. May I ask which high school you are from? Do you think the questions for this year’s exam are difficult?” ”

“Ye Zao smiled slightly and said politely, “I’m sorry, miss. . I don’t want to be on camera. You can interview the other students.” ”

“”We can mosaic you,”the reporter replied. ”

Ye Sen directly blocked in front of ye Zao and dialed the microphone that the reporter handed over. “My eldest niece doesn’t want to be on camera. You can ask me any questions you want!” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Ye Sen could tell at a glance that he was not to be trifled with.

The reporter apologized and brought the cameraman to interview the other examinees.

“Then, Ye Sen brought the mother and daughter to eat. ”

“The restaurants around the examination venue were basically full, so ye Sen drove to a relatively high-end restaurant. ”

“After eating, it was 12:30 pm. ”

The Math exam started at 3 pm.

“Therefore, Ye Sen booked two more rooms in the nearby hotel and took a break at noon. ”

“Ye Zao said, “Mom and uncle, you really don’t have to wait for me here in the afternoon. You guys should go back quickly! This is too much of a waste of time.” ”

“Whether it was Ye Sen’s express delivery company or Ye Shu’s restaurant, they could not be away from people for even a moment. ”

“Ye Sen said very seriously, “Zao Zao, the college entrance exam is a major event in life. At this time, you must have your family by your side. which examinee doesn’t have their parents by their side? Otherwise, even if we all go back, we will be absent-minded when doing things!” ”

“Ye Shu nodded. “Your uncle is right! At this time, no matter how busy we are, we must be by your side!” ”

Looking at Ye Sen and Ye Shu.

Ye Zhongruo suddenly returned to her previous life.

“In her previous life, when she participated in the college entrance exam, she was 15 years old. ”

“When she left the exam room, all that was waiting outside were the parents who sent her to take the exam. She was the only one who was alone. ”

Hence.

She was also used to being alone and was used to being alone.

“Although she had not been in this world for a long time, she felt a warmth that she had never felt before. ”

“”Mom, Uncle.”Ye Zhuo reached out and hugged the two of them. “Thank you.” ”

“Ye Sen and Ye Shu were a little at a loss from being hugged. They smiled and said, “This silly child.” ”

Math test at three in the afternoon.

Ye Shu and Ye Sen were still waiting for ye Zao outside the exam hall.

The weather in the afternoon was rather stuffy.

“Ye Sen turned on his phone and saw that the weather forecast said that there might be rain, so he went to the nearby 711 to buy an umbrella and also bought some water. ”

“Not long after Ye Sen left, an aunt came to strike up a conversation with Ye Shu. “Big Sister, your child is also taking the test inside?” ”

“Ye Shu nodded and asked, “Yes, Big Sister.” ”

“The aunt asked, “Your son and Daughter?” ”

“”Daughter,”ye Shu said. ”

The aunt nodded. “How many children do you have?”

“”One,”ye Shu replied. ”

“Hearing this, the aunt widened her eyes in surprise. “Only one daughter?” ”

“”Yes, that’s right.” ”

The aunt thought to herself.

Only one daughter. How could she inherit the incense in the future?

“But she was too embarrassed to say it directly. She said tactfully, “Big sister, you’re so young. You’ll probably have a second child, right?” ”

Ye Shu shook her head. “I’m not going to have another child.”

Hearing this.

The aunt was even more surprised.

Only one daughter and she wasn’t going to have a second child. wasn’t that going to be a death sentence?

No one knew what the youngsters of today were thinking!

All they wanted was to enjoy themselves!

They weren’t even willing to have another child.

“In the future, who would take care of them when they were old? ”

“The aunt continued, “Big sister, I think you’re still young. Why Don’t you want a second child? “Hurry up and get a second child while you’re still young. Otherwise, when you’re Old and have only one child, you’ll definitely regret it.” ”

Ye Shu smiled politely. “Our daughter is very filial. I Won’t regret it.”
