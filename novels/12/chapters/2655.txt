“As a man, work came first. ”

“It was the same for Bai Jingshu. Although she was pregnant, she had always been a creative person. She was a model writer in the eyes of the editors. ”

“Ye Shu said, “Jingshu, it’s all because you’re a good person! Not only did you not argue with him, you even defended him!” ”

“Bai Jingshu said, “Mom, I’m telling the truth.” ”

Bai Jingshu had many good friends who were already married. They would often complain about their mother-in-law in front of her.

“This was not good, that was not good. The relationship between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law was very discordant. ”

“Bai Jingshu had never had this kind of trouble. She and Ye Shu got along very well. They were not mother and daughter, but they were better than mother and daughter. ”

“Speaking up to this point, Bai Jingshu paused and continued, “Mom, I’m serious. You Don’t have to leave work to accompany me. I’m already so old. Can’t I take care of myself?” ”

“”It’s not a special time right now!”Ye Shu smiled and said, “Anyway, I don’t trust you alone.” ”

Bai Jingshu’s relationship with her biological parents wasn’t good to begin with. She couldn’t let Bai Jingshu not feel concerned at a time like this. Women were the most sensitive when they were pregnant.

“Ye Shu was a person who had been through this, so she could understand. ”

“After saying that, ye Shu continued, “Jingshu, logically speaking, you should have started. Why isn’t there any movement at all?” ”

“Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “It’s probably because the little one in her stomach isn’t willing to come out.” ”

“”Searing said that she came back today, but there’s still no sign of her.”Ye Shu continued, “Wait for her to come back and let her take a look.” ”

“”There’s no rush.”Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “When I went for the prenatal checkup, the doctor said that it’s normal to delay and bring it forward.” ”

“Compared to Ye Shu, Bai Jingshu was really not in a rush. She was a Buddhist, and she had to eat and drink every day. ”

Ye Shu had prepared the delivery bag and other things. She just had to be responsible for delivering the baby.

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “When I was pregnant with Ah Ze and searing flames, it was brought forward by a whole week.” ”

“”Usually, the twins will be brought forward,”Bai Jingshu said. ”

“At this moment, the sound of an engine came from downstairs. ”

“It must be searing.”Ye Shu stood up and walked downstairs.

“When she reached downstairs, she saw ye Zhuo and Cen Shaoqing walking in side by side. ”

Cen Shaoqing was carrying two big bags of things in his hands.

“Ye Shu jogged over. “Shaoqing, why do you always bring so many things every time you come here? !” ”

“No matter what, CEN Shaoqing would never come empty-handed. He always brought a bunch of things. ”

“CEN Shaoqing said, “Auntie, there are some things that my mother and grandmother prepared for the children.” ”

Bai Jingshu was about to give birth. Zhou Xiang and old madam Cen were very excited and prepared a lot of things for Cen Shaoqing to bring over.

“Go back and help me thank your mother and grandmother. You’re too polite!”

“CEN Shaoqing said, “We’re all family. Auntie, you’re Too Kind.” ”

Ye Shu reached out to take the things from Cen Shaoqing’s hands. “Let me take it.”

“Cen Shaoqing did not dare to let his mother-in-law take the things. He continued, “It’s alright, Auntie. It’s not heavy at all.” ”

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “This child.” ” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Ye Shu was extremely satisfied with Cen Shaoqing as her son-in-law. Cen Shaoqing was older than ye Zao and had a calm personality. Ye Shu believed that ye Zao would definitely be very happy in the CEN family in the future.

“Seeing the two of them like this, ye Zao smiled and said, “Mom, I realize that I’m becoming less and less in your eyes.” ”

“”You’re not carrying anything in your hands,”ye Shu said. ”

“Ye Zao held ye Shu’s arm and continued, “How’s my sister-in-law?” ”

“”Speaking of which, we were just chatting just now!”Ye Shu said, “Your sister-in-law’s expected delivery date is almost over, but there’s still no movement at all. What do you think is going on?” ”

“Ye Zhuo said, “Giving birth a week or two before and after the due date is a normal phenomenon. Mom, don’t be anxious. Just pay attention to sister-in-law’s condition. We can’t lack people at this time.” ”

“Bai Jingshu was in a situation where she could give birth at any time. Once people left her side, she would be in a very dangerous situation. ”

Ye Shu nodded. “I know that. I sleep in my room with Jingshu now.”

“Ye Zhuo had not been home for a while. When he heard this, he asked curiously, “Is my brother not at home?” ”

“”Your brother is out of town on a business trip.”Speaking of this, Ye Shu could not help but say, “Your brother is too much. He’s going out on a business trip at this time. Isn’t he afraid of Jingshu giving birth? Seriously!” ”
