Chapter 419: 120: We’re happy to be together. Master Five’s confession is burning! 1

Translator: 549690339

Confession?

He had never thought of this question.

Cen Shaoqing frowned slightly and turned to look at he ziteng. “How do I Confess?”

“Hearing this, he ziteng was even more speechless. ”

Was there a need to ask such a retarded question?

Cen Shaoqing was not usually stupid!

He was really smart and muddled for a moment.

“”Fifth brother, you’ve never eaten pork before, so you should have seen a pig run, right? Of course, the confession is to say things like ‘I like You’and ‘I love you’to my idol.” ”

Cen Shaoqing twirled the prayer beads. “Wouldn’t it be too rude to say that directly?”

He was worried that it would scare people!

“”Fifth brother! It’s the 21st Century Now! It’s just a confession! What kind of nonsense is that!”He ziteng continued, “But you have to be prepared before you confess. This way, your chances of winning are higher.” ”

“Prepared for what?”Cen Shaoqing asked.

He ziteng took out the experience he had accumulated over the years on the Internet. “To prepare lipstick! I heard that girls are always missing a lipstick on their dressing table!”

“Cen Shaoqing frowned. “But she doesn’t like to wear makeup.”Ye Zhuo had always had a plain face. Unless she attended some very important events, she would not wear makeup at all! ”

“”Just because she doesn’t like makeup doesn’t mean she doesn’t like lipstick!”He ziteng felt that Cen Shaoqing was the legendary straight man. “Brother Five, just listen to me! Buy More Lipstick! Then, does my idol have any other hobbies?” ”

“”She likes desserts,”cen Shaoqing answered. ”

“He ziteng said, “That’s simple. If my idol likes desserts, you can buy a dessert shop for her. If one doesn’t work, you can buy two. If two doesn’t work, you can buy all the dessert shops in Yun Jing!” ”

“As long as he could get his hands on a beauty, what was the point of buying a dessert shop? ”

“Anyway, Cen Shaoqing was not short of money. ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly. “This proposal is indeed not bad.”

“Based on Ye Zhuo’s preference for desserts, she would definitely be very happy to buy a dessert shop. ”

“After saying that, Cen Shaoqing turned to look at he ziteng. “What kind of lipstick do you want?” ”

“He ziteng took out his phone. “Brother Five, let me help you take a look.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing also started to send a wechat message to special assistant Zhou, asking him to buy a dessert shop. ”

“On the other side, Special Assistant Zhou was dumbfounded. ”

“Cen Shaoqing had asked him to look up the most delicious sweet water shop in Yun Jing yesterday, and today, he wanted to buy a dessert shop again. ”

Could it be that he was poisoned by the dessert? Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“At this moment, he ziteng raised his head to look at Cen Shaoqing. “Brother Five, I’ve found out that this shop’s lipstick is very good! Little girls like pink. I suggest you buy all of their pink lipstick!” ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“He felt that what he ziteng said was particularly right, because ye Zhuo really liked pink. ”

So Cen Shaoqing began to place orders.

On the other side.

Ye Zhuo replied to Cen Shaoqing’s message while sitting in front of his desk and working on his computer.

The computer screen kept changing with all kinds of pictures.

“After saving all the pictures, Ye Zhuo opened the QQ chat window and sent all the pictures to a person with the remark [ nine dynasties ] . ”

“Nine dynasties received the pictures and replied: [ thank you for your hard work, God. ] ”

[ you’re welcome. ]

“After sending the pictures, Ye Zao suddenly remembered that he had not started live streaming for a long time, so he turned on his computer and started live streaming. ”

“Just as he logged into his account, ye Zao received a bunch of private messages: [ goddess Ye, have you disappeared? ] ”

“[ on the first day that the goddess did not live stream, miss her. ] ”

“[ ye, please come online! ] ”

“[ on the thirtieth day of the Goddess’live broadcast, miss her or miss her. ] ”

Ye Zhuo flipped through the private messages one by one.

“[ Hello, Ye from Sitara YC! We are from Lanyue subculture! I heard that you have not joined any union yet. Do you have any intention of signing a contract? ] ”

“[ Hello, Ye from Sitara YC! We are from Dayan Nanfei culture. We sincerely invite you to join our union! We will give you the most powerful resources to promote and the best benefits! ] ”

[ ... ]

The next few messages were all private messages that wanted to sign a contract with Ye Zhuo.

Sign a contract?

Ye Zhuo raised her eyebrows slightly.

“Once you sign a contract with a company, your live broadcast time will be limited. The company will give you a concave character setting. Even your wechat, Weibo, and other social accounts will be fully represented by the company. ”

It was equivalent to having your personal freedom restricted.

“Instead of other people signing her, she might as well start her own internet celebrity management company and create a new era of internet celebrities! ”

“As Ye Zhuo thought about it, she turned on her live broadcast. “Hello Babies, it’s been a long time.” ”

“[ sob, SOB, sob! Leaf has finally waited for you! ] ”
