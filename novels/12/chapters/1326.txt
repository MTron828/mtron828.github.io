“Chapter 1327: 276: Xie Wanqiu was sent to the hospital because of anger, and she got her comeuppance! 4”

Translator: 549690339

This upbringing lasted for more than 20 years.

The child that she raised with her own hands was not something that Zhou Xiang could trample on.

“Moreover, Zheng Wanyin was the only person in this world that she was related to by blood. ”

She had to protect Zheng Wanyin.

Zhou Xiang wanted to bully Zheng Wanyin?

No Way!

“The more Xie Wanqiu thought about it, the more uncomfortable she felt, “She’s only so young, and I raised her up in a pile of SH * t and pee, yet she’s doing so well! And now she’s repaying me like this, Oh my God! Why is my life so miserable! If I had known this would happen, I wouldn’t have become someone’s stepmother even if I starved to death outside! It’s a thankless task! ” ”

A child can have anyone.

It just can’t be without a mother.

“All these years, she had always played an important role in Zhou Xiang’s life, but Zhou Xiang didn’t know how to be grateful at all. ”

How could there be someone like her in the world?

“If it weren’t for her, Zhou Xiang would have died long ago. ”

Let’s not talk about life and death.

Let’s talk about Zhou Xiang marrying into the Cen family.

“If it weren’t for her, would Zhou Xiang be able to know Cen Haifeng? ”

“In the end, Zhou Xiang still took advantage of her. ”

“Without her, there would be no Zhou Xiang. ”

“Xie Wanqiu’s howl was heard by everyone in the ward. One after another, they asked, “Elder, What’s Wrong?” ”

“Seeing so many people asking, Xie wanqiu became even more excited, “Let me give you young people a piece of advice. When you get married in the future, you must open your eyes wide. You can marry anything. You must never marry a second wife and become someone else’s stepmother! “Just look at me. I treat her as my own daughter, even more so than my own daughter. “But what about her? “How did she treat me? “A young man lost his husband, a middle-aged woman lost her daughter, and in his later years, he was sent to the hospital by his stepdaughter. Oh My God! “How can my life be so miserable!” ”

“Hearing this, the people in the ward sighed endlessly. ”

Xie Wanqiu’s experience was indeed miserable.

As the saying goes.

There are three Great Sorrows in life.

“Losing a mother at a young age, losing a wife (husband) at a middle-aged age, and losing a child at an old age! ”

“Xie wanqiu directly took up two of the three Great Sorrows in life. In her later years, she actually had to look at her stepdaughter’s expression. ”

Pitiful.

It was really too pitiful.

“”Old Man, you should be more open-minded. It’s good to be open-minded about everything.” ”

“How can there be such an unfilial daughter in the world!”

“”Many of their own children are filial to their parents, let alone stepdaughters!” ”

“Another person asked, “Elder, what is the relationship between you and this little girl?” ”

“Xie wanqiu grabbed Zheng Wanyin’s hand and said, “This is the blood and bone left behind by my short-lived biological daughter...” ”

“”I see. Elder, don’t be angry. Anger hurts the body. For the sake of this little girl, you can’t be angry.” ”

“”If anything were to happen to you, what would happen to the little girl?” ”

These words finally hit Xie Wanqiu’s heart.

Right.

She could not be angry.

She was the only person Zheng Wanyin could rely on in this world.

“If anything were to happen to her, wouldn’t Zheng Wanyin be too pitiful? ”

“Zheng Wanyin looked at Xie wanqiu, then she said, “Grandma, we are now living under someone else’s roof. Second Aunt Wants me to apologize to cousin-in-law, so I’ll go apologize! In any case, cousin-in-law is not an outsider. Even if I apologize to her, I Won’t lose anything! Please don’t quarrel with second aunt!” ”

Xie wanqiu frowned.

Ask her to forgive Zhou Xiang just like that?

Impossible!

“If she really forgave Zhou Xiang like that, Zhou Xiang would really think that she was easy to bully. ”

“Also, what right did Zheng Wanyin have to apologize to Ye Zhuo? ” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Ye Zao had always been arrogant and despotic. He did not put her as his grandmother in his eyes. If Zheng Wanyin apologized to ye Zao again, Ye Zao’s tail would probably be raised to the sky. ”

She did not want to see ye Zao’s smug face.

“Seeing that Xie Wanqiu was like this, Zheng Wanyin continued, “Grandma, bear with it for a while. If you take a step back, the sky will be wider than the sea...” ”

“As she finished speaking, Zheng Wanyin paused and lowered her voice, she continued, “Grandma, it’s not good for us to have a falling out with second aunt now. Have you forgotten the purpose of your visit to the capital? I was hoping that you could find me a good family in the capital!”As she said the last sentence, zheng Wanyin’s voice carried a hint of coquettishness. ”

Xie wanying narrowed her eyes and only then did she remember the important matter.

She had almost forgotten about it!

This trip was mainly for Zheng Wanyin’s personal matters.

“Thinking of this, the anger on Xie Wanqiu’s face subsided a little. “Don’t worry, I know what I’m doing.” ”

“Okay.”Zheng Wanyin nodded.

As long as Xie wanqiu listened to her.
