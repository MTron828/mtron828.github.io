Translator: 549690339

“Upon hearing that Bai Jingshu was about to give birth, ye Zhuo immediately nodded. “Alright, then I’ll go upstairs and get my phone. I’ll be right there.””

“”Okay, you should go quickly,”ye Shu said.”

“Ye Shu also went into the house to get things like the delivery bag. Giving birth was a major event, so she had to prepare a lot of things. Fortunately, Ye Shu had prepared these things many days in advance. Now, she just needed to go and get them.”

“Ye Zhuo immediately went upstairs to get his phone. When he went downstairs, Ye Shu happened to take the things and walk out.”

The nanny van was already parked outside.

Lin Ze carried Bai Jingshu down the stairs at this time. “Mom!” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Ye Shu immediately walked over. “How is Jingshu Now?”

“Bai Jingshu’s amniotic fluid had already broken. Her stomach was hurting, but when she heard ye Shu’s voice, she still smiled and said, “Mom, I’m fine.””

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Brother, don’t just stand there. Quickly carry sister-in-law to the car.””

Only then did Lin ze come to his senses and carry Bai Jingshu to the car.

Ye Shu and Ye Zhuo followed suit.

“After getting into the car, Ye Zhuo was just about to ask where Lin Jincheng had gone when he saw a black Bentley following behind the nanny van. This was Lin Jincheng’s car.”

Ye Zhuo looked at Ye Shu. “Is my dad’s car behind?”

Ye Shu nodded. “It’s your dad.”

Bai Jingshu endured the pain. “Why isn’t dad getting into the car?”

“Ye Shu explained, “Your dad is an old fogey. He said that he’s a father-in-law. His daughter-in-law is about to give birth, so it’s not suitable for him to be in the car.””

“The driver was a lady. Other than Lin Ze, everyone in the car was female. As a father-in-law, it wouldn’t sound good if people knew that he was sitting in the car.”

“Therefore, Lin Jincheng chose to drive alone to keep up with them.”

This would be good for everyone.

“Ye Zhuo took out the medical kit and continued, “Sister-in-law, are you in a lot of pain right now?””

“Bai Jingshu continued, “Actually, it doesn’t hurt very much. It just comes and goes. When it doesn’t hurt, it’s fine. But when it hurts, it’s that kind of excruciating pain.””

“It felt very strange, as if she was about to take a shit, but it wasn’t that kind of pain.”

“At this moment, Bai Jingshu finally understood why medical science classified the pain of childbirth as the highest level of pain.”

“Then are you in pain now?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“Bai Jingshu shook her head. “It doesn’t hurt very much now...”as soon as she said this, Bai Jingshu’s expression changed, and she continued, “It’s starting to hurt again.””

“Ye Zao sat opposite Bai Jingshu. “Sister-in-law, bear with it for now. I’ll Take Your Pulse.””

“Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded.

Ye Zao stretched out his hand to take Bai Jingshu’s pulse.

“A moment later, ye Zao continued, “The uterine opening has already been opened by one and a half fingers. Don’t be anxious for now. I’ll give you an injection to alleviate the pain.””

“Okay.”

“Lin Ze immediately asked, “What do you mean by one and a half fingers?””

He did not understand any of these medical terms. He only knew how to be anxious.

“Ye Zao explained, “Under normal circumstances, the uterus of a pregnant woman needs to be opened up to about ten fingers before she can prepare for delivery. Sister-in-law is only about one finger and a half now. We still have to wait for a while, so we can’t be anxious now.””

Lin Ze seemed to not understand. “Then how long do we have to wait?”

“Ye Zao said, “This depends on one’s physical condition. It can be as fast as one or two hours. Some people wait for seven or eight hours without giving birth.””

“In fact, ye Zao didn’t know much about these things in the past. Ever since Bai Jingshu got pregnant, she had specially added a lot of knowledge about obstetrics and gynecology.”

“Lin Ze nodded. “Then, what kind of system does your sister-in-law belong to?””

“Lin Ze was very anxious now. He had never experienced something like this before. Seeing how Bai Jingshu was in so much pain, he wished he could replace her.”

Ye Zao shook his head slightly. “I’m not too sure about that either. Let’s see how sister-in-law reacts to it.”

“Lin Ze continued, “Then give her a shot first.””

“Okay.”

Ye Zao opened the medical kit.

“Just as he was about to give her a shot, Lin ze said, “Wait.””

“”What’s wrong, brother?”Ye Zao asked.”

“Lin Ze said, “Will this shot affect your sister-in-law?””

“”Don’t worry, it won’t,”ye Zao replied.”

“That’s good.”Lin Ze heaved a sigh of relief.

“Ye Zao picked up the Golden Needle again. Bai Jingshu continued, “Zao, wait a moment.””

“What’s wrong with sister-in-law?”Ye Zao asked.

“Bai Jingshu continued, “Will it affect the child again?”If it affected the child, she could bear with it.”

She did not want to give birth to a defective child for the sake of her temporary comfort.
