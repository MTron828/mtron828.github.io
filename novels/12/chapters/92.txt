Chapter 93: 074: face-smacking, stunning! 7

The car window slowly rolled down, revealing an overly cold face. “Miss Ye, it’s too late. Shall I give you a ride?”

Zheng Zijun was stunned. He thought he was seeing things.

Was this CEN fifth master?

“Cen, Cen Fifth Master.”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly, opened the car door and got out. He opened the car door for ye Zhuo and Lin Sha in a gentlemanly manner.

It was indeed quite late.

Ye Zhuo did not refuse. After greeting Zheng Zijun, he and Lin Sha sat in the back seat. “Sorry to trouble you, Mr. Cen.”

“It’s on the way.”Cen Shaoqing’s tone was indifferent

On the way?

The corner of the driver’s mouth twitched.

If he remembered correctly, the hotel where ye Zhuo was staying was in the opposite direction from where Cen Shaoqing was staying.

It was a 60-kilometer journey back and forth.

It was really on the way!

The car was very quiet, almost completely silent.

About half an hour later, the car arrived at the hotel.

After alighting from the car.

Lin Shasha took a deep breath. “I was so nervous just now! That Mr. Cen was like an ice cube, so scary!”

Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly. “Is it that exaggerated?”

Lin Shasha nodded hurriedly. “Yes! Very much so!”

After Mu Yourong returned to the hotel, she wanted to open the live broadcast room and sell herself out, trying to get back what she had lost tonight. However, when she logged into her account, Mu Yourong was surprised to find that she had lost more than half of her fans!

From 30 million to 10 million!

Moreover, the recent video comments were all discussing her appearance.

Everyone felt that she had become ugly!

She used to be very good-looking. Although the system had helped her beautify a lot, it was not that ugly, right?

Mu Yourong hurriedly found a mirror.

What appeared in the mirror was a pale face.

It was listless, like a person who had been hungry for a long time.

It looked decadent.

It did not have the slightest bit of energy.

No! VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

This was not her!

Mu Yourong was used to seeing her beautiful face, so she did not believe that the person in the mirror was her.

Mu Yourong touched her cheek and asked in a trembling voice, “System, when can I change back?”

[ when the system upgrades to level 10, you will be able to return to your previous appearance. ]. ]

Level 10?

Mu Yourong was stunned. When she had just been reborn, the system was already level 10. After such a long time, the system had not been able to upgrade to level 11...

Now that the system had been forced to drop to level 1, how long would it take before it could level up to level 10?

If she could not change back, how would she be able to broadcast it live in the future?

What would she use to subdue Cen Wu Ye?

[ host, don’t worry, I’m Looking for a way to quickly level up. ]. ]

Mu yourong continued, “Why did you suddenly drop in level?”

[ it might be because ye Zao beat you. ]

Ye Zao!

It was ye Zao Again!

Wait!

She had to cut ye Zao’s face and make her pay the price of blood.

...

The next day, Ye Zao and Lin Sha prepared to take a stroll on the streets of the capital, while at the same time checking their cards at the famous online popular attractions.

At noon.

Snow actually started to fall from the gray sky.

Ye Zao was born in the south in his previous life, so he rarely had the chance to see snow.

Yunjing was located in an area that was neither north nor south. Although it was very cold in winter, there would not be a snowfall for almost ten years.

When she saw snow, she was quite excited.

Lin Sha was also a little excited. She pulled ye Zao and walked around in the snow.

They looked very much like two Huskies who were having fun in the snow.

The scene here fell into the eyes of the two kind-looking old men who were standing under a tree not far away and looking at the snow scenery.

Old Master Yang smiled and looked at Sun Fulian beside him. “Those two young men definitely haven’t seen snow before. When I see them, I seem to see my younger self.”

Unfortunately, his life had already come to an end. He would never be able to see such a beautiful snowy scenery again.

As he thought of this, a desolate expression flashed across old master Yang’s eyes.

Sun Fulian narrowed his eyes. “Isn’t that the little girl who saved people on the plane the day before yesterday?”

...

On the other side.

Mu Yourong took a car and arrived at the famous Mian Xiu Manor in the capital.

Just as she alighted from the car, she was stopped by the Manor’s security personnel. “Do you have a pass?”

Mu Yourong smiled. “I’m here to look for Old Master Yang. Please make an exception.”

The Yang family was the head of the top ten wealthy families in the capital, and the Yang family’s old mansion was located at Mian Xiu Manor.

“Wait a moment.”The security personnel sized up MU yourong. “I’ll make a call to verify.”

Mu Yourong clenched her fists.

It was really like a tiger that had fallen to the level of the Sun and was being bullied by a dog.

If this was in the past, when she was still a famous streamer of Miao Yin, wherever she went, she would be surrounded by the stars and the Moon?

But now, it was great!

Her beauty was gone, her glory was gone, and even a small security staff dared to make her suffer!

But now, she could only endure it.

When her Phoenix rose from the Ashes, she would definitely make these people pay the price!

Mu yourong continued, “Little brother, please tell Old Master Yang that my surname is Mu. I have a panacea that can cure him. Please ask him to meet me! Otherwise, he will definitely die of regret!”

Curing old master Yang was a way to quickly upgrade the system.

Mu Yourong used the popularity she had accumulated on the streamer to exchange for a pill.

As long as she ate this medicinal pill, old master Yang would be able to quickly recover!

The Yang family was the head of a wealthy family in the capital. If she saved Old Master Yang, not only would she be able to quickly upgrade the system, she would also be able to find a backer for the MU family!

With the medicinal pill in hand, Mu Yourong was full of confidence!

The security personnel glanced at MU yourong, then went in to make a call.

Not long after, the security young man walked out again. “You can go in.”

The Yang family manor was built in an imposing manner!

Mu Yourong stood in front of the magnificent and majestic building. When she thought about how fifth master Cen’s current residence was much more luxurious than this place, the corners of her mouth curled up into a smug smile.

When the system upgrade was successful and the beauty function was restored, she would definitely make fifth master cen bow down at her feet.

At that time!

The entire capital would be her world.

After learning that Mu Yourong had the medicine that could cure old master Yang, the Yang family placed great importance on Mu Yourong. Old Master Yang’s eldest son, Yang Danian, personally welcomed mu yourong into the manor, “Miss Mu, please take a seat for a while. Old Master Yang has gone out on some business. He should be back soon.”
