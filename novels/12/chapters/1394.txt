Translator: 549690339

Zhou Xiang did not say a word. She felt very uncomfortable in her heart.

“She did not want the Cen family’s reputation to be tarnished, but she also did not want to sever her relationship with Zhou Zuolong. ”

“Right now, there seemed to be only one path before her. ”

“She had been with Old Lady Cen’s wife and daughter-in-law for so many years, but she had never blushed once. was she really going to use her death to threaten Old Lady Cen this time? ”

“Seeing that Zhou Xiang did not speak for a long time, Xie wanqiu continued, “Xiangxiang, Are You Listening?” ”

“Zhou Xiang finally came back to her senses. “Mom, I’m listening.” ”

“”It’s good that you’re listening.”Xie wanqiu nodded, “Also, you should be more careful when you go to the north side. “You’re the elder sister. Your biological mother is no longer around, and I’m not the mother of the north side. As the ancient saying goes, the eldest sister is the mother. As the elder sister, you should take on the responsibility of being the eldest sister. If your biological mother were to see the father and son turn against each other underground, she would definitely feel very disappointed.” ”

“At this point, Xie wanqiu sighed, “I’m your stepmother. I know that even though you’ve always called me mother, in your heart, you don’t treat me as your biological mother. I Don’t blame you. After all, I’ve never been your biological mother. I just need to do it with a clear conscience. “It’s fine if you can’t understand me now about ye Zhuo’s matter, but I’ll go first. One day, you’ll understand me.” ”

“No matter who heard Xie Wanqiu’s earnest advice, they would think that she was a good mother and stepmother. ”

“Zhou Xiang felt a little uncomfortable. “Mom, Please Don’t blame me for not being sensible in the past. Don’t worry. From today onwards, you’re my biological mother.” ”

“Good child.”Xie wanqiu patted Zhou Xiang’s head. “Go back quickly.”

“Okay.”Zhou Xiang nodded.

Zhou Xiang returned to the Cen family home.

Old Mrs. Cen was sitting in the living room and talking to Zhou Jinbei.

“From Afar, Zhou Xiang could not hear their conversation. All he could see was old Mrs. Cen laughing loudly. ”

“Zhou Xiang was very worried, but he could only put it to heart. He still had a smile on his face as he walked over and said, “Mom, Jinbei.” ”

“Xiang Xiang is back.”Old Mrs. Cen raised her head to look at Zhou Xiang. “Where are you going? Why Are You So Worried?”

Worried?

Zhou Xiang was stunned.

She was obviously smiling. How did old Mrs. Cen see that she was worried?

She was really amazing.

“Zhou Xiang tried to pretend that nothing had happened. She smiled and said, “How could I be worried? Mom, you must have seen wrongly. I just went out with the Little Sisters.” ”

“OH.”Old Mrs. Cen nodded and did not expose Zhou Xiang’s lie.

“Zhou Xiang looked at Zhou Jinbei and continued, “Jinbei, I have something to tell you.” ”

Old Mrs. Cen stood up with a smile. “The two of you talk. I’m going out for a walk.”

Old Mrs. Cen came to the housekeeper’s room.

“The housekeeper saw Old Mrs. Cen and immediately went up to her. “Old Mrs. Cen, I was just about to look for you.” ”

“Where did Xiangxiang Go?”Old Mrs. Cen sat down on a chair.

“The housekeeper said, “Madam went to the hospital.” ”

The hospital.

“When she heard this, Old Mrs. Cen’s face was full of anticipation. ”

She had always known that Zhou Xiang had a soft personality.

“Therefore, when she heard this result, she was not surprised at all. ”

“”Why did she go to the hospital?”Old Mrs. Cen continued, “Did that disgusting couple make things difficult for her again?”Old Mrs. Cen was not even willing to call her in-laws and in-laws. ”

She did not blame Zhou Xiang.

“To be fair, Zhou Xiang was a very good daughter-in-law. ”

It was a pity.

People could not choose their own birth.

“The housekeeper continued, “I am not very clear about this. According to the people who came back, Mrs. Zhou stayed in the ward for more than two hours. During that time, Old Master Zhou and Old Mrs. Zhou came out to discuss something, but they did not hear what they specifically discussed.” ”

“Old Madam Cen frowned slightly. Although the people who went didn’t hear anything, she knew that the couple definitely didn’t have any good intentions. ”

“Especially that Xie wanqiu. She was clearly not sick, yet she stayed in the hospital and didn’t come out. ”

It was simply disgusting!

“”It’s true that having a stepmother will give birth to a stepfather. With such a father and mother, Xiangxiang is simply unlucky for eight lifetimes!”Old madam CEN continued, “Only Xiangxiang is willing to spoil them. If it were me, I would have already performed a face-off technique for them to see!” ”

“The housekeeper continued, “Fortunately, Old Master Zhou and Old Mrs. Zhou Don’t come often. Otherwise, Mrs. Zhou would have a hard time.”The housekeeper had been in the Cen family for so many years, so he naturally knew what kind of person Zhou Xiang was. ”

“”Often?”Old Mrs. Cen said, “If they dared to come often, would I let them go? If it wasn’t for the fact that Xiang Xiang’s mother left early and she only had one father, I would have fallen out with them a long time ago!” ”

“Zhou Xiang had a soft personality, so there were some things that could not be done by force. ”

“After saying that, old Mrs. Cen continued, “Keep an eye on that side for the next few days. I want to see what that couple is up to!” ”

“Okay.”The butler nodded.

On the other side.

In the house.

“Zhou Xiang looked at Zhou Jinbei. “Jinbei, I just went to the hospital. Dad told me that if you don’t go to the hospital soon, he will sever the relationship between father and son with you.” ”

“”Okay.”Zhou jinbei smiled and said, “I would love to.” ”

Zhou Jinbei had long wanted to break off the relationship with Zhou Zuolong.

“Unfortunately, Zhou Zuolong had bitten him too hard and used all his dirty tricks. ”

“”Jinbei,”Zhou Xiang held Zhou Jinbei’s hand and said, “Don’t act like a child. After all, he is our father.” ”

“”Sis...”Zhou Jinbei wanted to say something, but he swallowed his words. According to Zhou Xiang’s character, unless she saw something with her own eyes, she would never believe what he said. “Forget it. Let’s wait for the experts to repair the letter.” ”

“Zhou Xiang knew what Zhou Jinbei meant. “Jinbei, you’ve always placed your hopes on that suicide note. What if there’s nothing in that suicide note?” ”

“”Alright, then I’ll put it here today.”Zhou jinbei said firmly, “If there’s nothing wrong with that suicide note, I’ll kowtow to Zhou Zuolong and admit my mistake. From now on, I’ll be filial to him and I won’t say anything else! “But if mom’s death is related to him, then I’ll destroy his reputation! “I’ll make him bring Xie wanqiu to Mom’s grave and kowtow to mom to admit his mistake!” ”

“Zhou Xiang sighed. “Jinbei, have you ever thought about what would happen if the will was mom’s confession?”Zhou Jinbei was too stubborn and wouldn’t listen to anything. ”

“”I’ve said it before. As long as Mom’s will doesn’t mention the reason for her lying on the tracks, I’ll Kowtow to Zhou Zuolong and admit my mistake!” ”

“After saying that, Zhou Jinbei continued, “Sister, What About You? If the will is restored and proves that Mom’s death is related to Zhou Zuolong, what will you do?” ”

“That won’t happen.”Zhou Xiang shook her head. “This matter won’t have anything to do with father.”

“Zhou Xiang trusted Zhou Zuolong very much. After all, the person who died in bed was Wu Lan. ”

The suicide note left behind by Wu Lan was definitely a confession letter.

“”What if?”Zhou Jinbei said, “Sister, everything isn’t that absolute!” ”

“Zhou Xiang looked at Zhou Jinbei and continued, “If there is, then I’ll be just like you. I’ll sever my relationship with Father and never acknowledge him as Father Again!” ”

“Alright.”Zhou Jinbei nodded. “Sis! Remember what you said today.”

“Zhou xiang smiled and said, “Don’t worry, I’ll remember it.” ”

“After saying that.., zhou xiang continued, “The results of the repair haven’t come out yet. Dad will still be our dad. Mom is in the hospital now. As a child, she should go to the hospital to see them. “Also, I don’t know how mom and Dad found out about the burning pink diamond that you gave to Wanyin. Wanyin is your niece. If you gave it to burning red, you should have prepared one for Wanyin as well. You Can’t be biased and do something that people will gossip about.” ”

“Hearing this, Zhou Jinbei was so angry that he laughed. ”

He could roughly guess what Zhou Zuolong and Xie Wanqiu had said when Zhou Xiang went to the hospital.

Using the word ‘shameless’to describe them was an insult to the idiom ‘shameless’.

“What are you laughing at?”Zhou Xiang looked at Zhou Jinbei in confusion.

“Zhou Jinbei turned around to look at Zhou Xiang, “I’m laughing at their shamelessness, and I’m laughing at your stupidity! Sister, Zheng Wanyin is Xie Ying’s daughter. What kind of niece is she? Only that muddle-headed Zhou Zuolong would do something as cowardly as raising someone else’s child!”Someone Else’s child was a treasure to Zhou Jinbei, in front of Zhou Jinbei, they were not even comparable to grass. ” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Zhou Xiang frowned slightly, “Don’t say that. Xie Ying has already left. Wanyin’s child is quite pitiful. “Don’t look at the monk’s face and look at the Buddha’s face. In any case, Wanyin has called her father’s grandfather for so many years. You Can’t do that just because you call him ‘grandfather’. “Moreover, I can see that Wanyin really treats you like an uncle!” ”

“From Zhou Xiang’s point of view, Zheng Wanyin’s character was not bad. ”

Those terrible things were all caused by Xie Wanqiu and Zhou Zuolong.

“However, Xie Wanqiu and Zhou Zuolong had good intentions. Everything was because they had misunderstood ye Zhuo. As long as the misunderstanding was resolved, nothing like that would happen. ”

“Zhou Jinbei looked at Zhou Xiang. “SIS, have you forgotten how Xie Ying treated you back then?” ”
