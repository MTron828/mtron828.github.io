“”Goodbye, Daddy.”The three-year-old child did not understand why his father was sitting on the ground. He smiled and waved goodbye to his father. ”

“When the woman walked to the door, she glanced back at Wu Jiaguo. After a moment, she sighed softly and left with the child. ”

After the woman left.

Wu Jiaguo burst into tears in the empty room.

He was wrong!

He was really wrong!

He should not have disobeyed his wife’s advice and got entangled with Zou Feifei and her daughter.

“But now, it was too late! ”

...

On the other side.

At the Lin family home.

Zhou Yuelian cooked a table full of delicious food to celebrate the successful conclusion of Lin Sha’s college entrance examination.

“Lin Jinshui stood up with a cup in her hand. “Zhongruo, this cup. Uncle Toasts You. Uncle doesn’t know how to speak, so all the words are in the wine.” ”

“With that, Lin Jinshui finished the wine in the cup. ”

“Ye Zhonghuo also finished the orange juice in the cup in one gulp. “Uncle, you’re too kind. I didn’t do anything.” ”

“She had wanted to drink, but Zhou Yuelian and Lin Jinshui did not allow her to touch the wine, so she did not drink. ”

“”Zhonghuo, let me toast to you too.”Lin Shasha stood up from the chair with the cup in her hand. ”

“Ye Zao smiled and pulled Lin Sha to sit down. “Sister Sha Sha, there’s no need to stand between us.” ”

“Then we’ll both sit.”Lin Sha sat down.

“Lin Weiwei raised his glass. “Zao Zao, I’ll drink to you too! Thank you for helping my sister change her fate.” ”

Lin Sha’s revision was very effective. There would definitely be no problem with a key book.

And all of this was thanks to ye Zao.

It was ye Zao who had persuaded Lin Sha to stop her actions and stop her losses.

“That was why Zhou Yuelian and Lin Jinshui kept saying that ye Zao was the Lin family’s little lucky star. Ever since Lin Sha met ye Zao, the Lin family’s life had become more and more prosperous. ”

“”Brother Weiwei, you sit down too.” ”

“Lin Weiwei sat down and clinked his wine glass with ye Zao. Then, he drank the wine in his glass. ”

“Lin Sha smiled and said, “Zao Zao, my brother still doesn’t have a girlfriend. My mother is worried sick. Do you have a suitable girl by your side? Can you introduce her to my brother?” ”

Lin Weiwei was twenty-four this year.

“Although he was not old, all the boys his age already had girlfriends. He was the only one who did not have one. Furthermore, there were more boys than girls now, so his parents were very anxious. ”

“Hearing that, Lin Weiwei was a little embarrassed. “Shasha, what are you talking about?” ”

“Zhou Yuelian smiled and said, “Shasha is right! It’s time for me to introduce you to a girlfriend. Zhuozhu, do you have a suitable one by your side?” ”

“Ye Zhuozhu glanced at Lin Weiwei and then said, “If brother Weiwei is willing, maybe there really is one!” ”

“Really?”Zhou Yuelian’s eyes lit up when she heard that. “Where is the little girl from?”

“Ye Zhuo said, “She’s my classmate from university. She kept asking me to introduce her to a boyfriend.” ”

Lin Weiwei’s appearance was in line with Li Yueyue’s aesthetic standards.

Li Yueyue liked those fresh young men very much.

“”That’s Great!”Zhou Yuelian continued, “I’ll send Weiwei’s photo to you in a while. You can send it to your classmates to see. If your classmates like Weiwei, you can arrange for them to meet. What do you think?” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“Zhou Yuelian smiled and said, “Then it’s settled!” ”

“Okay.”

The whole meal was enjoyed by the guests and the host.

“After the meal, Ye Zhuo sat on the sofa and started chatting with Lin Shasha. ”

“”Let’s do it five times.”Lin Shasha continued, “I will go and get people.” ”

“”Okay.”Ye Zhuo clicked on the go-live button. At this time, Cen Shaoqing sent him a message. [ leader, I have returned to China. ] ”

Ye Zao was a little surprised. [ so soon? ]

“Cen Shaoqing replied almost instantly. [ yeah. I’m done here, so I came back. Where are you now? ] ” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Ye Zao: [ at Sister Shasha’s house. I’m preparing to go dark. Do you want to come? ]

“Cen Shaoqing: [ Okay, I’ll go online immediately. ] ”

“Before this, Cen Shaoqing knew nothing about games. Ever since he got to know ye Zao, he had become a little king expert! ”

“After seeing Cen Shaoqing Online, ye Zhuo sent an invitation over. ”

“Seeing an unfamiliar profile picture joining, Lin Sha asked curiously, “Your family member?” ”

“Yes.”

“Lin Sha had seen Cen Shaoqing before and said in surprise, “So your family member also knows how to play games? I thought he was just one of those overbearing ceos who sits in the office all day and doesn’t smile!” ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “You’ve read too many romance novels.” ”

“Lin Shasha said, “It’s not that I’ve read too many romance novels. It’s that your man is simply a tyrant.” ”
