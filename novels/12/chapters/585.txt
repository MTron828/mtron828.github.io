“”Your husband is strict?”He ziteng said in disbelief, “Are you saying that you’re especially powerful in front of fifth sister-in-law and she has to listen to you? Fifth sister-in-law is your husband’s strict?” ”

“Of course.”Cen Shaoqing looked ahead.

“At this moment, Ye Zhuo had already opened the car door. ”

Song Chenyu also sat in the car.

“Song Chenyu’s car was a Lamborghini. The interior of the car had been specially modified. Although it could not be compared to CEN Shaoqing’s car, it could still be ranked on the international racing rankings. ”

Cen Shaoqing’s car was indeed a good car.

“Unfortunately, she did not meet a good racing driver. ”

“Thinking of this, a regretful look appeared in song Chenyu’s eyes. ”

“Ye Zhuo fastened his seatbelt calmly. Cen Shaoqing’s car was indeed not bad. Its performance was good and the configuration was high. The moment she got into the car, she knew that this car had been modified. ”

The race entered the countdown.

Everyone in the spectator area was very nervous. They stared at the big screen on the field without blinking.

“Five, four, three... ”

“In fact, everyone knew the outcome of this race. No matter what, Song Chenyu was a professional. Ye Zhuo, a nineteen-year-old girl, might have just gotten her driver’s license. Could she race? ”

“However, everyone was still very curious. ”

They wanted to see how song Chenyu would crush her opponent.

“After all, Ye Zao was Cen Shaoqing’s real girlfriend. ”

“In the absence of Ye Zao, only song Chenyu could enter and leave the CEN family. At that time, everyone thought that song Chenyu would become the future mistress of the CEN family. Who would have thought that Cheng Yaojin would appear out of nowhere, he directly snatched song Chenyu’s position. ”

One!

“When the number on the big screen jumped to one, the red car was the first to bear the brunt. ”

It rushed out just like that! Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

This was song Chenyu’s car.

“Seeing this scene, the crowd let out a wave of screams. ”

“So Handsome!”

“Professionals are different after all.”

“Didn’t miss ye say that she was also an expert? Why is she so slow?”

“”Ziteng, didn’t you call Miss Ye a godly person? Have you seen a few godly people turn a racing car into a tractor?” ”

“Cen Yuyan looked at the Red Car on the big screen excitedly. When she looked at the black car behind her, her eyes were filled with disdain. ”

“She didn’t know how to race, yet she still had to pretend to be fat. ”

She was a clown who made a fool of herself!

He ziteng was also a little surprised.

“He did not expect ye Zao to be so slow. If this continued, would she be able to catch up with song Chenyu? ”

“”Brother Five, is fifth sister-in-law feeling unwell somewhere?”According to Ye Zao’s ability, she should not be so slow unless she was feeling unwell somewhere. ”

Cen Shaoqing looked at the black car on the screen. There was no trace of worry in his deep eyes. “The race has only been a few dozen seconds. Why are you in such a hurry?”

There was a period when a racer and a car would get used to each other.

It was normal for ye Zhuo to need to familiarize himself with the car’s performance since it was his first time coming into contact with Knight No. 5.

Song Chenyu was already mentally prepared that ye Zhuo did not know how to race.

“However, she did not expect that ye Zhuo’s skills would be so poor. ”

Song Chenyu’s lips curled up as she looked at the black figure in the rearview mirror.

“Actually, Cen Yuyan was right about one thing. ”

“If one tried to squeeze into a different circle, they would only make a fool of themselves. ”

“Perhaps ye Zao had not figured out how to drive yet, but knowing how to race was a completely different concept. ”

A little girl was a little girl.

Too Nave.

Could it be that mature men liked this kind of nave little girl?

“Song Chenyu narrowed her eyes and continued to speed up. Although she knew that ye Zao did not have much strength, she would not let her guard down. She also knew the principle of the tortoise and hare race. ”

Now was not the time for her to let her guard down!

There was a big turn ahead.

She wanted to completely shake off ye Zao!

Chi —

“At this moment, the black car that song Chenyu had left behind suddenly sped up and rushed over. ”

It was so fast!

One could only see an afterimage.

Song Chenyu’s pupils suddenly constricted!

“This, this was ye Zao’s car? ”

“Seeing that the black car was getting closer and closer to her, Song Chenyu hurriedly sat up and accelerated! ”

The people in the viewing area looked at the big screen and stood up from their seats excitedly.

They had thought that ye Zao was a piece of scrap metal.

They did not expect that this person was actually a king.

“Oh my God!”An unbelievable voice sounded from the crowd. “The black car is going to overtake the Red Car!”

“It’s going to overtake! It’s going to overtake!”

“Song Chenyu, who was in the Red Car, was dumbfounded. ”

“She had wanted to take advantage of the big turn to shake off ye Zao, but she had not expected ye Zao to overtake her. ”

Song Chenyu frowned.

“From the moment she got into the car, she had told herself not to let her guard down. She had not expected that she would still let her guard down. If she had tried her best from the start.., she would definitely not let that ye Zao Pass so easily! ”
