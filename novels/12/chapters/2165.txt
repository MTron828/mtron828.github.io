“Oh, even though Miss Ye had suffered a lot in the past, this was not something that everyone wanted to see. Mr. and Mrs. Man had already done so much, what else could miss ye not be satisfied with ”

“This time, I stand by Mr. and Mrs. Man ”

I advise Mr. and Mrs. Man to give up on Ye Zao. She has no heart anymore

[ I feel that man Xing is many times better than ye Zao. I remember that man Xing said that he missed his elder sister during an event. ]

[ ... ]

“All of a sudden, the comments on the Star Network were all directed at Ye Zao. ”

Ye Zao had gone from the famous Miss Ye in changyue to an unfilial and unfilial daughter.

“Filial piety was the priority. As an important figure in the s galaxy, Ye Zao should set a good example for everyone and become a role model for everyone in the world. ”

What was Ye Zhuo doing?

“Looking at the comments on the starnet and the video of Zhao Dan kneeling down, Ye Han was furious. “This whole family is really vicious. They actually used this trick to force you to recognize them! Sister, what should we do now?” ”

Ye Zhuo took a bite of the dessert and looked a little relaxed. “Don’t be anxious. There will always be a way to solve the problem.”

“”Sister, what time is it now? You still have the mood to eat!”Ye Han looked at ye Zhuo who was still eating and said somewhat speechlessly. ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “You can solve the problem just by being anxious? Look at you, you’ve been anxious since then until now, but you still haven’t been able to solve the problem. Come, sit down. This passion fruit-flavored cake is not bad, try it.” ”

“”I can’t eat it,”ye Han said. ”

Ye Zao Shrugged. “Then I can only enjoy the delicacies by myself.”

“Looking at Ye Zao, Ye Han helplessly took a breath and anxiously paced around ye Zao. However, Ye Zao was not anxious, as if the main character of the incident was not her. Instead, she looked at Ye Han, “Can you stop circling around? You’re Making Me Dizzy!” ”

“”SIS, it’s really urgent now!”Ye Han said. ”

“After ye Zao finished the last dessert, she looked up at ye Han and continued, “What’s the situation on the Star Network Now?” ”

“Take a look for yourself.”

“Ye Han pressed the button beside him, and a transparent screen immediately appeared in the air. The screen displayed the latest situation on the star network. ”

[ could you please get her out of the S Galaxy? ]

“[ looking at Mrs. Man’s statement, she’s already on her knees. What is Ye Zao still unhappy about? ]? Just because she’s Ye Zao, does she think she’s amazing? I really didn’t expect that the Miss ye that we’ve always looked up to is actually this kind of person! ] ”

[ forcing your own biological mother to kneel. You’re really a good daughter! ]

[ I can’t take it anymore! How can there be such a daughter in this world! ]

“[ ye Zhuo, please respond immediately! ] ”

[ I’m angry! ]

“[ Ten Thousand People’s blood letter, Ye Zhuo, get the hell out of the S Galaxy! ] ”

“[ it’s too scary, Mr. and Mrs. Man are so nice, how could they give birth to such a daughter? ] ”

“[ things have turned out this way, but the person involved has no reaction at all. Not only does he not understand his parents, he even denies his parents! ] ”

“”The moment I saw Mrs. Man kneel down, I really cried! As a parent, I really can’t stand this kind of news. For the sake of our next generation, please get out of the s galaxy, Ye Zhuo!” ”

“...” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Ye Zhuo flipped through the comments on the starnet one by one, but no expression could be seen on his clear and handsome face. ”

“On the other side, man Xing was also reading the comments. His slender fingers flipped through the netizens’anger, and the corners of his mouth curled up slightly. ”

This result was exactly what she had imagined.

“However, Ye Zhuo’s choice was a little out of her expectations. ”

She had originally thought that ye Zhuo would either acknowledge his parents or resolutely refuse to acknowledge them.

She had not expected that ye Zhuo would actually create a pair of fake parents.

It seemed that ye Zhuo was not as wise as she had imagined.

“Creating fake parents that had nothing to do with her would not only not appease the anger of the people, but instead, it would make their anger even more intense. ”

Like now.

Man Xing straightened her back and dialed the burning sandalwood incense on the incense burner on her desk.

“It was a very fresh smell, but it was still a lot different from the one she smelled in the headquarters. ”

Reality proved that some things could only be owned by those who had reached a certain status.

“As for equality for everyone, that was all empty talk. ”

“At this moment, Man Wen ran in from outside and said indignantly, “Sister, don’t worry. No matter what, I will stand on your side. I will definitely not let ye Zhuo come back and snatch your position!” ”

“Man Xing raised his head and looked at man Wen. He said earnestly, “Man Wen, don’t be like this. Miss ye is our eldest sister.” ”
