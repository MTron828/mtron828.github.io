Chapter 1438: 307: We don’t have professor Yue Here! 1

Translator: 549690339

Professor Yue led all the members of Section B to strike!

“If Cen Shaoqing didn’t find a solution soon, the entire section B would be paralyzed. ”

The reason why Professor Yue dared to lead all the members to strike was because of the importance of their research room in section B. she was certain that Cen Shaoqing would admit defeat and personally apologize to them.

“If it weren’t for the fact that she was 100% confident, even if professor Yue wanted to lead all the members on a strike, the 50 members of the research lab in Area B wouldn’t agree to it! ”

“However, at this critical moment, Cen Shaoqing’s first thought wasn’t how to solve this crisis, but what ye Zhuo had just said he wanted to eat. ”

Could it be that the entire research lab in Area B was less important to Cen Shaoqing Than Ye Zhuo?

“If professor Yue found out about this, he would definitely be furious. ”

“After a while, Zhou Yue raised his head and looked at Cen Shaoqing. “Miss ye seemed to have mentioned that a spicy and sour powder shop in the east of the city tastes pretty good.” ”

“”The east of the city, right?”Cen Shaoqing lowered his head slightly and slowly twirled the Buddha beads. ”

“Yes.”

Cen Shaoqing turned around and walked out. “To the east of the city.”

Zhou Yue was stunned.

“Ye Zhuo had only casually mentioned it, but Cen Shaoqing was actually planning to go? ”

“Seeing that Cen Shaoqing’s figure had already disappeared outside the door, Zhou Yue immediately trotted to follow Cen Shaoqing’s footsteps. ”

This spicy and sour noodles shop in east side of the city was located in a small alley.

“The owner of the shop was an old couple. As they did not know how to advertise online, they were all regular customers. Although there was no long line in front of the door, there was always an endless stream of people coming to eat. ”

The old couple were very enthusiastic.

“Zhou Yue pushed the door open and got out of the car. “Master five, I’ll get out to buy some.” ”

“Wait in the car. I’ll go by myself.”Cen Shaoqing reached out and closed the car door.

Zhou Yue was stunned.

Cen Shaoqing had already gotten out of the car.

“He was tall and had long legs. His black windbreaker accentuated his powerful aura. He did not fit in with the simple and crude spicy and sour powder shop. As soon as he entered, he attracted everyone’s attention. ”

Some girls started to secretly take pictures with their phones.

“Under the high-definition camera, there was not a single blemish on his face. ”

“The girls almost screamed, but they still held it in. ”

“At this moment, a heavy shadow was cast over. ”

The girls looked up and saw that it was Cen Shaoqing walking over.

What was he doing here?

Could it be that he was here to ask for their wechat signal?

“When they thought of this, they were extremely excited. ”

“A moment later, Cen Shaoqing opened his thin lips and said, “Delete it. My girlfriend will be angry.” ”

Delete it?

His girlfriend will be angry?

“Such a handsome man actually had a girlfriend. Furthermore, he had the potential to be a strict wife... ”

“One of the girls quickly reacted. “Alright, Alright. We’ll delete it immediately.” ”

“Cen Shaoqing did not say anything else. He walked over and ordered, “Two servings of hot and sour noodles, to go.” ”

“The old lady smiled and said, “Okay, do you want anything else besides hot and sour noodles? Our stewed duck neck and duck feet are also pretty good.” ”

Cen Shaoqing hesitated.

“The old lady continued, “Sir, you’re going to go back to eat with your girlfriend, right? Girls like to eat duck neck and duck feet.” ”

“CEN Shaoqing said, “Then I’ll have some of both.” ”

“Okay.”The old lady nodded. “Please wait a moment.”

“Very soon, two servings of hot and sour noodles were ready, along with a serving of duck feet and duck neck. ”

Cen Shaoqing carried the things back to the car.

The hot and sour noodles smelled very fragrant.

“Just as Cen Shaoqing got into the car, Zhou Yue smelled a seductive fragrance. ”

“He had also eaten hot and sour noodles with his girlfriend, but this was the first time he had seen such a fragrant one. ”

This miss ye was really amazing!

She even discovered such a remote hot and sour noodles shop.

“When he was on vacation, he would also bring his girlfriend over to eat with him. ” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Dongcheng was a distance away from the base. In order not to affect the taste of hot and sour noodles, Zhou Yue sped up and took a shortcut. The original twenty-minute journey took ten minutes. ”

Cen Shaoqing carried the hot and sour noodles to ye Zao’s office.

“Through a glass door, Cen Shaoqing saw ye Zao in the middle of a meeting. ”

Ye Zao signaled him to wait for a while with his eyes.

Cen Shaoqing nodded.

“Five minutes later, the meeting ended and Cen Shaoqing pushed the door open and entered. ”

“Cen Jiang, Cen he, Cen Hu, and Cen Hai walked out from inside. When they saw Cen Shaoqing who had been waiting outside for five minutes, they were secretly speechless. In this world, the only person who dared to make Cen Shaoqing wait was probably ye Zao. ”

“”Hello, Fifth Master.”The four brothers greeted Cen Shaoqing one by one. ”

Cen Shaoqing nodded slightly.

“Cen Shaoqing had just closed the door when CEN he lowered his voice and said, “Do you think fifth master looks like a little wife?” ”
