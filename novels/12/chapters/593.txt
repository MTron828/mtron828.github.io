“Chapter 594: 143: The Unexpected Dr. YC, a large-scale face-smacking scene! 3”

“At home, she followed her father, and when she married, she followed her husband.”

“Old Mrs. Lin still retained the old-fashioned way of thinking in her bones, and she especially liked this kind of daughter-in-law who would submit to her father.”

Not to mention other things.

“At the very least, this kind of person did not dare to talk back to their elders. They were easy to control and control, and they did not dare to do things like Zhao shuning.”

Feng Qianhua nodded. “Of course it’s true! Do you think I can lie to You?”

“Old Madam Lin continued, “What does that person look like?””

“”He has an oval face and double eyelids. He’s pretty and he’s about 1.63 meters tall,”Feng Qianhua said with a smile. “Don’t worry, he’s definitely worthy of fourth brother. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have blindly pulled strings.””

“Old Madam Lin frowned. “Then, why is she already 38 years old and hasn’t gotten married yet?””

“Feng Qianhua explained, “Jiang Suran was a single person when she was young. Later on, she got older and older. After she went to female Durban, she came to her senses.””

“Have you seen her in person?”

Feng Qianhua nodded. “Of course I have.”

“Then what do you think of Jiang Suran’s character?”

“Feng Qianhua smiled and said, “Aunt Lin, do you think that people who have been to female Durban have a bad character? Don’t worry! Jiang Suran’s character will definitely suit your heart! I just don’t know if fourth brother will like her.””

“Old Madam Lin trusted Feng Qianhua’s judgment. “Qingxuan that child has always been obedient. If I like her, he will definitely like her.””

“If Lin Qingxuan was disobedient, would he have married Zhao shuning back then?”

Definitely not.

“After saying that, old madam Lin continued, “Tonight, I’ll ask Qingxuan for his opinion. You have to help me take care of this matter.””

“Okay.”Feng Qianhua nodded.

Ye Zhuo was playing in the garden with the five little ones.

“The Lin family only had one girl and the little ones only had one aunt. All of them were extremely excited. The six of them ran around in the garden. “Aunt, I’ve woven a garland for you.””

“”Thank you, Duan.”Ye Zao squatted down and Duan helped ye Zao put on a beautiful garland.”

The bright colors of the flowers complemented his exquisite brows and eyes. Every frown and smile could seduce one’s soul.

This was a true person who was more delicate than a flower.

“Duan cupped his chin and asked ye Zao, “Aunt, do you like the Garland that Duan gave you?””

“Of course I like it.”Ye Zao nodded.

“Nono quickly stuffed the candy into ye Zhuo’s hands. “Auntie, Nono will give you half of the candy. You like Nono too, okay?””

“Okay.”

“Dongdong did not show any signs of weakness. “Auntie, this is my pocket money. I’ll give you half!””

The other two children also took out their treasures. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“...”

Feng Xianxian stood not far away and looked at the scene in the garden. She was so angry that her face was distorted.

Aunt?

What kind of Aunt Was Ye Zhuo?

Only she was their only aunt!

“Feng Xianxian narrowed her eyes and grabbed the things in her hands. She walked over with a smile. “Duan Duan, Dong Dong, Nuo Nuo, Yang Yang, Rui Rui!””

“Aunt Xianxian!”

Aunt?

“Feng Xianxian’s expression stiffened, but she quickly recovered. She smiled and said, “Nuo Nuo, didn’t you always call me aunt?””

“Nuo Nuo said, “No, you’re not our aunt! Only aunt is our real aunt. You’re Aunt Xianxian.””

The other children nodded as well.

Feng Xianxian raised her head to look at ye Zao beside her.

Ye Zao was sitting on a wooden swing with a flower wreath on his head and a smile on his face.

He was mocking her!

She was mocking herself.

“Feng Xianxian tried her best to suppress the anger in her heart. “According to seniority, you should also call me aunt.””

“Daddy said that you can just call me aunt because you’re from the same generation as him. Only the daughter of an uncle can call me aunt.”

“Feng Xianxian continued, “I even brought gifts for you guys today. Do you guys want gifts?””

“As she finished speaking, Feng Xianxian waved the gifts in her hands. “If you guys want gifts, just obediently call her Auntie.””

“No.”Nono shook her head. “Auntie has a robot that can talk and think. The gifts you gave are too Low.”

“We don’t want your gift!”

“I don’t want it either!”

“Feng Xianxian held her anger in her heart. It was neither up nor down, and she was about to suffocate.”

These damn children really didn’t have the ability to see at all! It was all in vain to curry favor with them previously!

“In order to smoothly gain a foothold in the Lin family, Feng Xianxian would bring gifts to the five children every time she came to the Lin family.”

“But this time, not only did the children confiscate her gifts, but they also addressed her as aunty instead of Aunty. All of them chased after ye Zao.”
