Zhou Zuolong could not accept this fact. He had treated Xie wanqiu so well and treated her as the woman he loved the most in his life.

“For Xie wanqiu, he had even given up on his first love. ”

But Xie Wanqiu had betrayed him.

“Looking at the unsightly photos, Zhou Zuolong could not control himself at all. The veins on his face bulged and his eyes turned scarlet. ”

“Looking at it this way, it was a little scary. ”

“B * Tch! B * Tch! I’ll kill you! I’ll kill you all!”

“Zhou Zuolong tore the photo in his hands into pieces like an angry wild wolf. If Xie Wanqiu and Wu Youyu were standing in front of him now, he would really stab them to death with a knife. ”

Zhou Zuolong had never dreamed that Xie Wanqiu would betray him.

That was Xie Wanqiu!

“The gentle, kind, and well-read Xie wanqiu. ”

“Even more unexpectedly, Xie Wanqiu’s cheating partner was actually Wu Youyu. ”

He treated Wu Youyu as his own brother and told Wu Youyu everything he knew and said.

It was a pity that they met late!

But what about Wu Youyu?

He took the green hat and put it on his head.

When did they get together?

How long did they keep it a secret from him?

No.

This was not true.

Zhou Zuolong’s hands were shaking.

“After a long while, he calmed himself down. He took a deep breath, put the rest of the photos in his bag, and walked to the hospital. ”

He had to find Xie Wanqiu and ask her about it.

Why did Xie Wanqiu betray him? !

“When she saw him return, Zheng Wanyin came up to him. “Grandpa, didn’t you say that you were busy? Why are you back so soon?” ”

Zhou Zuolong looked at Zheng Wanyin who was walking over and suddenly felt a sense of familiarity.

He actually felt that Zheng Wanyin’s eyes were exactly the same as Wu Youyu’s.

Could it be that Zheng Wanyin and Zhou Zuolong were related by blood?

“If Zheng Wanyin was really related to Wu Youyu, then wouldn’t they have been together for more than forty years? ”

“Was he mistaken, or was all of this true? ”

“Seeing that Zhou Zuolong did not speak for a long time, Zheng wanyin continued, “Grandpa, What’s Wrong? Are you feeling unwell?” ”

“Nothing.”Zhou Zuolong reacted at this time. “Where’s your grandmother?”

“Zheng wanyin said, “She’s inside talking to my cousin.” ”

Zhou Zuolong nodded.

“Zheng wanyin continued, “Grandpa, second aunt, she...”Zheng Wanyin was really unwilling to accept this. She was about to follow Zhou Xiang to the Cen family and marry Cen Shaoqing smoothly. ”

“Who would have thought that at the crucial moment, such a mishap would occur. ”

Although Zhou Xiang had always been an obedient girl and did not dare to disobey Zhou Zuolong.

“But this time, Zhou Xiang seemed to have changed into a different person. ”

“Not only did she resist Zhou Zuolong, but she also hit Xie Wanqiu. ”

“Zhou Zuolong tried his best to hide the anger in his heart and said with a smile, “Don’t worry, I have a way to deal with that unfilial daughter!” ”

Zheng Wanyin nodded.

Zhou Xiang was Zhou Zuolong’s daughter. Zhou Zuolong had his own reasons for saying so.

Zhou Zuolong walked inside.

“Xie wanqiu, who was in the inner room, had heard Zhou Zuolong’s voice long ago. She turned to look at Xie Rongle, “RONGLE, I can see that that girl, Xiang Xiang, is really angry. Otherwise, she would not have treated me like this and treated your uncle like this! “They are father and daughter, but because of me, they separated. I’m a sinner, and I’m not a good mother. I’ve let them down, and I’ve let your uncle down even more... “...” ”

“Xie rongle comforted, “Aunt, this is not your fault. It has nothing to do with you. You’ve already treated Zhou Xiang well enough. It’s Zhou Xiang who doesn’t know how to appreciate a good person!” ”

“Xie wanqiu sighed. “Back then, I chose to be with your uncle regardless of the secular world. I should have thought of today. In order to be with your uncle, I caused your cousin to lose her life.” ”

“Hearing this, Zhou Zuolong, who had already walked out of the door, stopped in his tracks. ”

Xie wanqiu’s words reminded him of the past.

“In order to be with him, Xie Wanqiu had indeed sacrificed a lot. ”

It could be.

He might have misunderstood Xie wanqiu.

It could also be that someone was framing Xie wanqiu to sow discord.

Zhou Jinbei!

It had to be Zhou Jinbei.

“With the development of technology, it was very easy to synthesize a photo. ”

Perhaps Zhou Jinbei had found someone to synthesize these photos.

Xie Wanqiu loved him so much that she definitely wouldn’t betray him. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“After some thought, Zhou Zuolong reached out and knocked on the door. ”

“”Come in,”Xie Wanqiu said from inside. ”

Zhou Zuolong pushed the door open and entered. “Wanqiu.”

“Uncle is back.”Xie Rongle stood up from her chair.

“Zhou Zuolong nodded and turned to look at Xie wanqiu. “WANQIU, are you feeling better now?” ”

“Xie wanqiu said, “Much better. You Don’t have to worry.” ”
