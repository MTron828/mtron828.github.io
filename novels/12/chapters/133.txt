Chapter 134: 082: How Does It match with her? She doesn’t even have the slightest discernment! 7

As for Ye Shu.

She should just go back to where she came from.

Ye shuang continued, “Oh right, mom, there’s still money. Little Shu has at least 50 million in her hands right now. She’s a woman, what does she need so much money for? When the time comes, it won’t be worth it if she’s cheated. You just have to leave her 1800 yuan. The rest must be handed over to you for safekeeping!”

Ye Shu was simply too easy to deceive.

Otherwise, when she was young, she would not have been deceived so miserably!

These tens of millions were all in Ye Shu’s hands. Ye Shuang was really worried.

Yao cuifen nodded repeatedly. “Xiao Shuang, you’re absolutely right!”Ye Shu was her daughter. If she had not given birth to Ye Shu, how would ye Shu have gotten to where she was today?

Therefore, Ye Shu’s things were hers!

Everything was hers!

Fifty million was hers!

The restaurant was hers too!

She had to keep all of it for Ye Shuai.

Ye Dafu frowned. He felt that this matter wasn’t that simple. After all, Ye Shu had already severed ties with them that day. “What if Xiao Shu doesn’t give it to us?”

“Doesn’t give it to us? How dare she not give it to us! I’m her mother!”Yao Cuifen said angrily. “If she doesn’t give it to us, I’ll beat her to death!”

Ye shuang smiled and said, “Father and mother, don’t worry. Xiao Shu will definitely give it to me. No matter what, you’re both her biological parents. Xiao Shuai is her brother! She’s a woman. If she doesn’t give these things to her parents and brother, who should she give them to? Should she give them to outsiders?”

As long as ye Shu had a brain, she should know that she shouldn’t give them to outsiders.

Ye Shuai was the most promising man in the Ye family.

Ye Shu did not have a son, so she should give everything to Ye Shuai!

Yao Cuifen nodded. “Xiao Shuang is right! Let’s go, Old Man. Let’s go to that unfilial daughter’s house now and get our things back!”

That was tens of millions!

If they were late, Yao Cuifen was worried that ye Shu would waste the money.

Ye Dafu stood up as well.

Ye shuang smiled and said, “Dad, Mom, don’t be anxious. Wait for Xiao Shuai and his sister-in-law to come back from work. We’ll go together tomorrow. Otherwise, you won’t know that Xiao Shu fooled you.”

Only then did Yao Cuifen give up on the idea of going to look for ye Shu now.

At night.

When Ye Shuai and his wife heard about this, they were also extremely excited.

Fifty million plus three storefronts.

Oh My God!

They had never seen so much money in their entire lives.

“Honey, from Tomorrow onwards, we won’t have to go to work. From now on, we’ll be the boss and the Lady Boss!”Ye Shuai hugged Lin Xiaowei excitedly.

Lin Xiaowei was also very excited. “Look at your little sister. She’s usually quiet, but I didn’t expect her to be so amazing. In just a few months, she even opened a restaurant.”

“She doesn’t have the ability!”Ye Shuai’s expression was a little disdainful. “Didn’t you hear what big sister said? Ye Shu is being kept by a rich benefactor! These things are all given by the benefactor!” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Lin Xiaowei did not continue this topic and continued, “I’ve already thought about it. After we get the fifty million tomorrow, we’ll go to Big Sister’s neighborhood and buy a villa too! For the remaining money, we’ll hire four nannies...”

Lin Xiaowei used to be very envious of ye Shuang. She was envious that she was a rich lady. Not only did she not have to do anything, but she also had several nannies at home.

Now, it was finally her turn to be proud.

She finally did not have to be envious of ye Shuang anymore.

Ye Shuai nodded in agreement. “Wife, don’t forget, there’s still a restaurant! My mother said that you’ll be in charge of the finances, and I’ll be the boss! We’ll pair up and work without tiring!”

He would be in charge of the finances.

Lin Xiaowei was naturally willing to do so.

That night, the Ye couple, Ye Shuai, and Lin Xiaowei did not sleep well.

They got up at 5:30 in the morning in excitement.

It was winter morning, and the Sun had yet to rise at 5:30 in the morning.

The family sat in the living room, thinking about the future business of the restaurant, and then it was about how to spend the 50 million.

Lin Xiaowei said that she would hire a few nannies to serve Yao cuifen well.

Yao Cuifen was grinning from ear to ear. Her daughter-in-law was still filial.

Unlike ye Shu.

Once you have money, you forget your mother.

At seven o’clock in the morning, the family treaded on the frost and arrived at Ye Shu’s residential area.

Yao Cuifen looked at the environment of the residential area. Compared to the basement where ye Shu used to live in, it was a thousand times better.

After all, she had money!

She even had such a good house to live in.

Unfortunately, she didn’t have the heart to live in such a good house. She didn’t know how to take care of her parents, brother, and sister-in-law!

Little B * Tch!

Ye Shu had just finished making breakfast when she heard a knock on the door.

Ye Shu walked over to open the door.

When she saw the person outside, she frowned slightly.

Lin Xiaowei smiled and said, “Xiaoshu, your parents, your brother, and I are here to see you. Happy New Year!”

Ye Shu ignored her. “What are you guys doing here?”

“What? I can’t even come to my daughter’s House?”Yao Cuifen grabbed ye Shu’s hand. “Xiao Shu. No matter what, you’re Mom’s biological daughter. Can’t your dad and I come over to see you?”

As she said that, Yao Cuifen pushed ye Shu away and entered the house by herself.

“Yo, your interior decoration is not bad! Good Boy! is that a bird’s nest? Why is such a good bird’s nest on the ground?”Yao Cuifen quickly walked over and picked up the bird’s nest.

Little B * Tch, you’re spoiling bird’s nest so badly, don’t you know to send it to a mother like me!

Ye Shu frowned slightly. These bird’s nest and tonics were brought over by Old Master Yang the last time he came over.

She didn’t know that her parents would suddenly come over, so she didn’t put them away.

Ye Dafu sat at the dining table and said with a sullen face, “Your brother and we haven’t eaten yet. Hurry up and get some food over here! Standing there like a nail, you don’t have any vision at all!”

At this moment, the door was pushed open from the outside.

“If I remember correctly, my mother cut off relations with you guys the last time, right?”
