“Song Shiyu was lying on the bed, his face very ugly. ”

“Seeing him like this, doctor Liu was shocked. He immediately walked over and asked, “Boss song, are you okay?” ”

“I’m fine.”Song Shiyu shook his head slightly. “I just have a little discomfort in my stomach.”

Doctor Liu put down the medical kit and came over to check song Shiyu’s pulse.

“A moment later, he let go of Song Shiyu’s wrist and asked, “Boss song, you touched the food that you shouldn’t have touched again!” ”

He thought that song Shiyu would persevere for a period of time until he recovered. He did not expect song Shiyu to recover so quickly and forget about the pain.

“Song Shiyu said, “I ate a little. I thought eating a little would be fine.” ”

“”Your current condition is that you can’t eat these things. You Can’t even touch them. It has nothing to do with how much you eat.”Doctor Liu said seriously, “Boss song, do you know that because you ate these things today, all our previous efforts have been in vain!” ”

Song Shiyu didn’t say anything.

“Doctor Liu realized that his tone was a little harsh. He slowed down and continued, “Boss song, you’re an adult now. You have to have self-control.” ”

“Logically speaking, song Shiyu was a big man. He shouldn’t be unable to control himself because he was greedy. ”

“However, song Shiyu couldn’t control himself time and time again. ”

“Song Shiyu nodded slightly. “Thank you for your trouble, Doctor Liu.” ”

“After putting song Shiyu in such a state, doctor Liu sighed helplessly. ”

He was convinced by such a patient!

He was convinced!

“”Boss song, I’ll give you a prescription first. Remember not to touch the food during the process of taking the medicine!” ”

“Okay.”Song Shiyu nodded.

“After writing the prescription, doctor Liu handed it to his assistant, and then he handed song Shiyu a bottle of medicine. “This is for pain relief. Boss song sincerely recommends that you don’t take this unless the pain is unbearable.” ”

Song Shiyu nodded. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

On the other side.

The next morning.

The first thing Yu Luonian did when he woke up was to reach out to hug the person next to him out of habit.

“But this morning, he found nothing. ”

Where was he?

Yu Luonian opened his eyes and saw that there was nothing around him. There was no trace of Xian er.

But Yu Luonian didn’t think too much about it. Maybe he went to the bathroom.

“When Yu Mumu opened his eyes again, it was already 9:30 in the morning. ”

There was still no trace of Xian ‘er by his side.

“Yu Mumu frowned slightly. Normally, as long as he opened his eyes, Xian ‘er would be by his side, helping him put on clothes and shoes. Even the toothpaste was squeezed for him! ”

“But today, Xian ‘er had actually disappeared! ”

What was going on?

“Yu Luonian massaged his temples, and Xian ‘ER’s words from last night echoed in his ears. Only then did he realize that Xian ‘er was playing hard to get with him. ”

Did she really think that he would fall for it?

“Over the years, he had seen countless similar tricks, and he had long become numb to it! ”

Xian ‘er would only be asking for trouble by doing this.

“Yu Luonian tidied up, got up, and went to the bathroom to take a shower. ”

“When Yu Luonian arrived at the dining room, Ye Zhuo was already eating breakfast at the dining table. ”

“She could eat two or three people’s worth of food, so when she saw the pile of food in front of Ye Zhuo, Yu Luonian was no longer surprised. “Good morning, sister-in-law.” ”

“Good Morning.”Ye Zhuo raised his eyes slightly.

“Yu Luonian sat opposite ye Zhuo. First, he ate a sandwich, then he said, “Sister-in-law, I’m a little curious about what you actually said to Xian ‘er.” ”

“Ye Zhuo asked, “She left?” ”

“Yes.”Yu sunset nodded.

“Ye Zhuo continued, “She didn’t say anything. She just told her to follow her heart.” ”

Follow her heart?

“If ye Zhuo really only wanted Xian ‘er to follow her heart, Xian ‘er wouldn’t have left right away. ”

“Yu sunset understood Xian ‘er quite well. She was still well-behaved and couldn’t think of any tricks to play hard to get. Perhaps, it was ye Zhuo who instructed her to do so! ”

“Yu Luonian continued, “Sister-in-law, let’s make a bet.” ”

“What Bet?”Ye Zhuo asked.

“Yu Luonian said, “In less than three months, Xian ‘er will come back to look for me!” ”

“Okay.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly. “What if she doesn’t come back?”

“Yu Luonian said very confidently, “If she doesn’t come back, I will have a women’s fashion show at your and Zixu’s wedding!” ”

“Yu continued, “But if I win, you’ll let Zixu wear drag at your wedding!” ”
