He was so engrossed in his conversation with Bai Jingshu that he did not realize that his phone had automatically turned off when it ran out of battery.

“”It’s fine. Next time if you’re going home late, remember to let me know in advance.”Ye Shu yawned. ”

“Okay.”Lin Ze nodded. “Definitely.”

“At this moment, Lin Jincheng came down from upstairs. “Ah Ze is back?” ”

“Dad.”Lin Ze turned around to look.

“Lin Jincheng continued, “What’s wrong with you, child? You came back so late and your phone was switched off. You made your mother worry for so long!” ”

“Ye Shu had a deep sense of guilt towards Lin Ze. Hence, she paid extra attention to Lin Ze’s matters, even more so than her husband. ”

“”My phone is out of battery.”Ye Shu looked at Lin Jincheng. “Alright, Alright. Go upstairs and sleep. Ah Ze didn’t do it on purpose!” ”

Lin Jincheng didn’t say anything and turned around to walk towards the bedroom.

“Ye Shu continued, “Ah Ze, you should also wash up and go to sleep. I’m going to sleep too.” ”

“After saying that, Ye Shu yawned as she walked towards the bedroom. ”

“”Mom, Goodnight.”Lin Ze looked at Ye Shu’s back and said. ”

“Goodnight.”Ye Shu waved at Lin ze without looking back.

“Lin Ze also went back to his room to wash up. Just as he walked to the stairs, he saw ye Zao leaning on the railing and looking at him with a smile. ”

“Brother.”

“Lin Ze looked up and said, “Zao Zao, why aren’t you going to bed?” ”

“Ye Zao didn’t answer Lin Ze directly. Instead, he said, “Brother, you’re in a good mood today.” ”

“”Yeah, it’s okay,”Lin ze answered. ”

“Just okay?”Ye Zao asked in return.

“”What do you think?”Ye Zao continued, “Isn’t it because people are in a good mood when they have a happy occasion?” ”

“”Nothing can escape your eyes,”Lin ze said with a helpless smile. ”

“”I knew it.”Ye Zao straightened his back and continued, “Brother, I wish you and your future sister-in-law a fruitful relationship as soon as possible and get the beauty back.” ”

Lin Ze’s face turned red at these words. “Thank you.”

“You’re welcome.”Ye Zhuo covered his mouth and yawned. “I’m going to sleep now. I’m a little sleepy.”

“”Oh Right,”Lin Ze continued. ”

Ye Zhuo turned his head slightly. “What’s Wrong?”

“Lin Ze said, “Zhuo Zhuo, aren’t you curious about who she is?” ”

“Ye Zhuo smiled and said, “I’ll know who she is when you bring your future sister-in-law back to meet the parents.” ”

“That’s true.”Lin Ze nodded. “Then go to bed! Good Night!”

“Good night.”

“After the siblings said good night to each other, ye Zao returned to his room and took a rose bath before going to bed. ”

Lin Ze and Bai Jingshu’s relationship progressed very quickly and steadily.

“Three months later, Lin Ze suggested bringing Bai Jingshu home to meet the parents. ”

Bai Jingshu was stunned. “Isn’t that too fast?”

“Lin Ze looked at BAI Jingshu and said, “You’re the person I’ve decided on in this life. Bring her home early and bring her home late. You’ll be the only one. If you think it’s too early, we can wait a little longer.” ”

“”Then let me think.”Bai Jingshu smiled and said, “What if uncle and Auntie Don’t Like Me?” ”

“”Don’t worry, that’s impossible. Have you forgotten how my parents treated you the last time you were at my house?”After marrying Lin Ze, there was absolutely no need to worry about the relationship between mother and daughter-in-law. ”

That was because ye Shu was not the kind of unreasonable person.

Bai Jingshu recalled the treatment she received at the Lin family and could not help but smile.

“When are you going to bring me back to meet my parents?”Lin Ze continued to ask.

“Bai Jingshu considered it very seriously and continued, “I’ll go back tomorrow and tell grandfather about this first so that he can make some preparations.” ” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Okay.”Lin Ze nodded. “I’ll go back with you.”

“You’re going too?”Bai Jingshu asked.

“”I have something to take care of,”Lin ze said. ”

He was mainly going back to take care of the Shangguan family.

“Okay.”Bai Jingshu nodded.

“The next day, after Lin Ze talked to his parents, he went back to Galaxy S with Bai Jingshu. ”

“However, Lin Ze was going to take the interstellar shuttle to Galaxy F. ”

“Bai Jingshu didn’t go home. Instead, she went straight to the old house. ”

“As usual, elder Bai sat in the yard and basked in the sun. ”

“The Sun in Galaxy S was not the same planet as the Sun on Earth. However, like the sun, it would emit light and heat to provide energy. ”

“In order to commemorate Earth, the first batch of humans in Galaxy S named this planet that provided energy and heat as the sun. ”

“Grandpa.”Bai Jingshu jogged over.

“”Jingshu is back!”Hearing Bai Jingshu’s voice, elder Bai sat up abruptly, but he didn’t see Bai Jingshu’s figure. Was she dreaming? ”
