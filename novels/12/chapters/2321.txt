“When Wen Zhi left, Ye Zhuo was discussing a plan with Dr. Zhang. Through the door, Wen Zhi could hear the anxiety in ye Zhuo’s voice. ”

“Wen Zhi’s lips curled slightly, and then he reached out to knock on the door. ”

Du Du du —

“Come in.”Ye Zhuo’s voice came from inside.

Wen Zhi pushed the door open and entered.

“Seeing that it was Wen Zhi, ye Zhuo continued, “What’s the matter?” ”

“Wen Zhi handed the documents to ye Zhuo and said, “Captain Yu asked me to bring these documents for you to sign.” ”

“”Leave them here,”ye Zhuo said. ”

“Hearing this, Wen Zhi’s heart skipped a beat. ”

Ye Zhuo wasn’t going to sign them now?

How could that be possible!

He still had to take one of the documents back to report back!

“Wen Zhi continued, “Miss Ye, Captain Yu said that these are all very important documents that require your immediate signature and review. Otherwise, his side won’t be able to carry out the rest of the work.” ”

“Got it. Wait a moment.”Ye Zhuo picked up the pen on the table and started to sign.

“Just as Wen Zhi thought, ye Zhuo did not look carefully at the contents of the document. He signed page after page like a signing machine. ”

“Seeing this scene, Wen Zhi was very excited, but he was also a little afraid. After all, the next page was the gambling agreement page. ”

“When people were afraid, they would naturally feel a little guilty. ”

“Professor Zhang saw that something was wrong with Wen Zhi and asked curiously, “Assistant Wen, did you do something wrong?” ”

“Wen Zhi immediately reacted and looked at Professor Zhang. “No, why would you say that?” ”

“Professor Zhang was already suspicious of Wen Zhi, so he continued, “If you didn’t do anything wrong, why are you shaking?” ”

“I’m not shaking!”Wen Zhi tried his best to calm himself down. He could not give himself away at such a critical moment.

He had to calm down!

Calm down!

“Ye Zhuoben’s hand that was signing the document also stopped at this moment. He looked at the two of them and asked, “What’s wrong, Professor Zhang?” ”

“Professor Zhang continued, “I just think that there’s something wrong with assistant Xiaowen.” ”

“Wen Zhi pretended that nothing had happened and said in a relaxed tone, “Professor Zhang, it’s probably because you’ve been too tired recently that you’re hallucinating.” ”

“Ye Zhuo reached out and pressed his temple. “Dr. Zhang, you should go back and rest first.” ”

“”I’m really not tired,”Dr. Zhang continued, “Miss Ye, please sign it quickly. After you sign it, we’ll continue with the plan we just discussed.” ”

“That’s fine.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly and continued to sign.

“Seeing ye Zhuo continue to sign, Wen Zhi heaved a sigh of relief. ”

“In a moment, Ye Zhuo signed all the documents and left one behind. He handed the other to Wen Zhi. “Take it and hand it over.” ”

“Wen Zhi immediately took the documents. “Miss Ye, I’ll be leaving first.” ”

“Go ahead.”Ye Zhuo waved his hand.

Wen Zhi immediately turned around and left.

“Professor Zhang looked at Wen Zhi’s back and narrowed his eyes. “Miss Ye, it’s not that I want to say this, but I really feel that there’s something wrong with this Wen Zhi! Don’t you feel anything at all?” ”

“What’s Wrong?”Ye Zhuo asked back.

“Professor Zhang continued, “It’s just very strange. He seems to be guilty of something. By the way, Miss Ye, do you want to see if there’s anything wrong with the document he just signed for you?” ”

“There’s no need to look at it.”Ye Zhuo did not take this matter to heart at all. “There’s no problem.”

Professor Zhang touched his nose. “But you didn’t even look at it.”

“Ye Zhuo looked up slightly. “I believe in my own judgment. Professor Zhang, Do You Believe in me?” ”

Dr. Zhang immediately nodded. “Of course I believe in You.”

“On the other side, after Wen Zhi received the signed agreement, he immediately asked for a leave of absence from Yu Zifei, “Captain Yu, I received a message from my father saying that my mother is critically ill and he wants me to go back quickly. If I don’t go back, I might never see my mother again!” ”

He had to quickly send the agreement to C Nation before ye Zhuo could react.

“Hearing this, Yu Zifei frowned slightly. “You know what the situation at the base is like now. If you go back now...” ”

“Before Yu Zifei could finish his sentence.., wen Zhi said with red eyes, “Captain Yu, I’m begging you. I’m the only son my mother has. If she doesn’t see me one last time, I won’t feel at ease for the rest of my life! Captain Yu, I’m begging you! Please let me go back for a while!” ”

“Then when will you be back?”Yu Zifei asked.

“Wen Zhi said, “After I see my mother!” ”

“Yu Zifei hesitated for a moment. “Alright, go back quickly!” ”

“”Thank you, Captain Yu, thank you, Captain Yu!”Hearing that, Wen Zhi couldn’t help but bend down to thank him. ”

“Yu Zifei continued, “Go back quickly.” ”

“”Then I’ll go back first. Team leader Yu, I’ll thank you on behalf of my parents!” ”

Yu Zifei waved his hand.

“Just as he turned around, the corners of Wen Zhi’s mouth curled into a sarcastic arc. ”

What Miss Ye.

Team leader Yu.

Doctor Zhang.

These people were all scum in his eyes.

He alone had toyed around with these big shots who had shaken the world.

Especially ye Zhuo.

Wen Zhi flew the aircraft back.

“The original landing point was Beijing, China. ”

“But when Wen Zhi was about to land in Beijing, he changed the landing point and changed the landing point from Beijing to C country. ”

“When he heard that Wen Zhi was back, Kevin was so excited that he waited at the landing point in advance. ”

“About an hour later, the white aircraft successfully landed on C country’s territory. ”

Kevin immediately went up to welcome it. “How was it?”

Wen Zhi walked out of the aircraft. “Everything went very smoothly!”

“Really?”Kevin’s face was filled with disbelief.

“Of course it’s true.”

Kevin stretched out his hand towards Wen Zhi. “Bring Me the betting agreement to have a look.”

Wen Zhi immediately took out the agreement. “Have a look.”

“Kevin took the agreement and looked at it carefully. Finally, he let out a laugh. ”

Good!

This was great!

They were going to announce this news to the world.

The base that belonged to them was about to return.

They finally did not have to rent their own base from the Chinese.

“Kevin was very excited. He patted Wen Zhi on the shoulder. “Mr. Wen Zhi, your future is definitely limitless!” ”

“Wen Zhi was also very excited. He immediately bowed and thanked him. “Thank you, Mr. Kevin, for your training!” ”

“This was all thanks to Kevin. If it weren’t for Kevin, he would still be a small assistant until now. A small assistant with nothing. ”

“But now, it was different. ”

“He was highly valued by Kevin. In the future, he would also have a place in the scientific research community of C Nation. ”

“Although China was good and was the most technologically advanced country, in China, he would never be able to make a name for himself. He could only be a small assistant. ”

“There was a saying that said, “It’s better to be the head of a chicken than the tail of a Phoenix!”! ”

“In the future, he would definitely make everyone’s eyes light up. ”

Kevin took the agreement and went to look for Mi Jia Di. “Doctor! Doctor! It’s Done!”

“Mi Jia Di was originally drinking water. When she heard Kevin’s voice, she did not even have time to drink. She immediately put down her cup. “What’s the situation?” ”

“Kevin handed the agreement to her. “Doctor, look. YC has signed it!” ”

“Hearing that, Mi Jia Di immediately took the agreement. After reading it, her eyes were filled with excitement. She continued, “Immediately arrange for the media. I want the whole world to know about this!” ”

“As Kevin had said, they had to take the initiative in this matter. They had to make it look real so that ye Zao and the others would be caught off guard. ”

They must not give ye Zao any chance to resist!

“Okay.”Kevin nodded. “I’ll make the arrangements right away!”

“Wait a moment!”Mi Jiadi suddenly said.

“Do you have any other instructions?”Kevin turned around.

“Mi Jiadi continued, “Where’s Wenzhi?” ”

“Kevin continued, “He’s outside!” ”

Mi Jiadi narrowed her eyes. “Call him over.”
