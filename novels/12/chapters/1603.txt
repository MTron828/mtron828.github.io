“Hearing this, Xiao Qing tightly creased his brows.”

“Tang Xue calmly sized up Xiao Qing’s expression. After a moment, she said with some surprise, “Little aunt, don’t tell me that you really don’t know about Tang Mi and the aircraft carrier project team?””

“Xiao Qing shook his head. “I don’t know. If I knew, I would definitely stop her!””

“Although Xiao Qing was not in the research community, when she heard the news about the aircraft carrier incident, she felt that a three-year agreement was a fantasy.”

Three years?

“If China could really build an aircraft carrier within three years, then country C and the other big countries would no longer have a need to exist in this world!”

“One had to know that 100 years ago, country C had joined forces with the more developed countries at that time to start researching spaceships and aircraft carriers.”

“Now, 100 years had passed. Not to mention aircraft carriers, even spaceships that could reach the speed of light had not been developed!”

“As a Chinese, she loved China more than anyone else. She hoped that her country could become stronger day by day. She also hoped that the CEN base could represent China in building the world’s first aircraft carrier that could reach the speed of light.”

“However, China had been invaded before. After that invasion, China was more than twenty years behind the world.”

“Now, China was developing. Although technology was changing, it was impossible to build an aircraft carrier that could reach the speed of light.”

“Before this, Xiao Qing had always treated this matter as news. However, she did not expect her daughter, Tang Mi, to actually become the main character of this matter.”

This made Xiao Qing somewhat unable to accept it.

“Tang Xue took in all of Xiao Qing’s changes in expression, “Since Tang Mi didn’t tell you about this matter, then she definitely didn’t want you to know! It’s all my fault! It’s my fault for blabbering. Auntie, don’t blame Tang Mi. After all, people walk higher, water flows lower! Tang Mi has the desire to advance, and her idea of becoming a person above others is right!””

“This sentence seemed to be a compliment on the surface, but it was actually a sarcastic remark.”

Tang Mi wanted to be the best?

How could it be so easy to be the best?

“Tang Mi was such an untalented idiot. Even entering the CEN base was thanks to her. If it weren’t for her, Tang Mi wouldn’t have been accepted by the CEN base!”

She still wanted to be the best!

Wasn’t this ridiculous?

“At this moment, the sound of a car engine could be heard in the air.”

Xiao Qing turned around and saw that Tang Mi had returned.

“When he saw Tang Mi, the anger in Xiao Qing’s eyes grew even more.”

“Tang mi walked over and greeted politely, “Auntie, Mom.””

Mother Tang smiled and nodded. “Tang Mi is back.”

“Yes.”

Xiao Qing looked at Tang Mi. “Can’t you see that your sister is also standing here?”

“Tang Mi had argued with Tang Xue before, but now that Xiao Qing had opened his mouth, she could only bite the bullet and call Tang Xue, “Sister.””

“Tang Xue smiled and said, “Tang Mi is back.””

“Xiao Qing looked at Tang and Tang Xue. “Her aunt and Xiaoxue, then we’ll go back to our room first.””

“Let’s go back.”Tang nodded. “We should go back too.”

Since they were walking to their respective doors.

“Tang mi walked beside Xiao Qing and saw that his expression didn’t look right. She smiled and said, “Mom, did my dad make you angry again?””

Xiao Qing didn’t say anything.

Tang mi scratched her head. “Mom?”

Xiao Qing still didn’t say anything.

“Actually, when Xiao Qing didn’t say anything, he was quite scary. Tang Mi didn’t dare to say anything more.”

“After a while, the mother and daughter entered the house together.”

Tang Shengli walked out with a smile. “It’s good that you two are back. Go Wash your hands and get ready for dinner!”

“”Eat, eat, eat! What else can you do besides eating?”Xiao Qing said angrily.”

The smile on Tang Shengli’s face stiffened. “What’s wrong? who provoked you?”

“Ask your good daughter!”

“Me?”Tang mi pointed at herself. “What did I do to You?” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Tang Shengli also looked at Tang Mi. “Hurry up and apologize to your mother!”

“Tang mi said somewhat speechlessly, “What did I do wrong? I’m just going to apologize?””

“”Her mother, what did her daughter do wrong?”Tang shengli turned to look at Xiao Qing.”

Xiao Qing was furious. “Let her say it herself!”

“Tang Shengli pointed at Tang mi and said, “Say it yourself!””

Tang Mi was speechless. “What did I say?”

“”That’s right!”Tang shengli nodded and turned to look at Xiao Qing. “Her mother, what did you tell her daughter to say?””

“Xiao Qing was furious. “Tang Shengli, shut up! I have ears, and I can hear myself! Look at you, don’t you look like a Father?””

Tang Shengli scratched his head but didn’t say anything.

“Xiao Qing looked at Tang Mi and continued, “Let me ask you, did you join the aircraft carrier project team?””
