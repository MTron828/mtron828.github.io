“”What ugly fish?”Cen Yuyan frowned. “Grandma, Sunfish is my best friend. How can you say that about her!” ”

“Old Mrs. Cen looked at Cen Yuyan. “Let me ask you, what day is it today?” ”

“”Saturday,”Cen Yuyan replied. ” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The smile on Old Mrs. Cen’s face gradually disappeared. “Didn’t boss tell you that Shaoqing is bringing his wife back today?”

“Yes.”

“Then why did you bring an Outsider Home?”Old Mrs. Cen asked. “Don’t you know that today is a family banquet?”

“”Chenyu is not an outsider!”Cen Yuyan tried her best to suppress the anger in her heart. “Grandma, Chenyu is my best friend. At the lowest point in my life, at the most confusing time, she was the one who helped me!” ”

“”That was all your doing!”Old Mrs. Cen rolled her eyes. “Cen Yuyan, I’m telling you, if you dare to bring a mess of people home again at the next family banquet, I’ll Chase You Away Too!” ”

“After saying that, old Mrs. Cen walked back angrily. ”

“The next second after she returned to the living room, Old Mrs. Cen’s kind smile returned as if nothing had happened. ”

Cen Yuyan looked at Old Mrs. Cen’s back view.

She was so angry that she wanted to kill someone.

“Before she left the capital, Old Mrs. Cen still liked her very much. She did not even say anything harsh to her. ”

“But now, for an outsider. ”

Old Mrs. Cen actually said such words to chase her out of the house.

What was this?

What was the background of ye Zao?

“She had not even entered the house, but she had already coaxed old Mrs. Cen to this extent. If she entered the house, would she still have a place in the CEN family in the future? ”

Cen Yuyan gritted her teeth.

“Old Madam Cen came to the living room. “Yezi, I just went to the kitchen to take a look. There’s boiled meat and silver fish soup that you like the most today. You have to eat more in a while. After dinner, Grandma still has some good things to give you.” ”

Ye Zhuo nodded.

“Seeing Cen Yuyan come in, Song Chenyu stood up from the sofa. “Old Madam, Auntie, Fifth Master, Miracle Doctor Ye, and all the sisters. I still have an advertisement to shoot in the afternoon, so I Won’t disturb you.” ”

“Zhou Xiang said, “It’s almost time to eat. Stay for dinner?” ”

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “Thank you, Auntie. I Won’t eat anymore.” ”

“After saying that, he turned to look at Cen Yuyan and Gu Dening. “Yuyan, dening, I’ll go back first.”. ”

Cen Yuyan felt a little sorry for Song Chenyu.

“Song Chenyu was clearly a guest that she had invited, but now he was forced away by old Madam Cen. ”

“Although Old Mrs. Cen did not say anything explicitly, song Chenyu was clear-minded and definitely noticed that old Mrs. Cen did not welcome her. ”

“”Chenyu, I’ll send you off.” ”

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “There’s no need.” ”

“Although song Chenyu said there was no need, Cen Yuyan still insisted on sending her out. ”

They walked out of the Cen Manor.

“Cen Yuyan said apologetically, “I’m sorry, Chenyu. I’ve made you suffer.” ”

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “Yuyan, what are you talking about? Where did I suffer?” ”

“CEN Yuyan continued, “My grandmother is old and muddle-headed. Don’t hold it against her.” ”

“Song Chenyu was obviously a good and kind girl, but Old Madam Cen said that she was an ‘ugly fish!’ ”

Wasn’t she just old and muddle-headed?

“”Don’t worry, I didn’t suffer any grievances. Also, I feel that old madam is a very cute grandmother.”Song Chenyu continued, “I really have an advertisement to shoot. Yuyan, don’t let your imagination run wild.” ”

“Cen Yuyan was moved and hugged song Chenyu. “Chenyu, thank you.” ”

Song Chenyu patted Cen Yuyan’s back.

“Cen Yuyan said somewhat dispiritedly, “Chenyu, I feel that ye Zhuo isn’t simple. I don’t know what’s going on. In any case, I just don’t like her! I don’t know why my grandmother likes her so much!” ”

Ye Zhuo must have used flowery words to deceive old madam CEN.

“”Actually, to be honest, Miss ye is really quite outstanding. She’s talented and beautiful. Moreover, she’s the famous Miracle Doctor Ye.”Song Chenyu pulled Cen Yuyan’s hand and sat down on the wooden bench, “This is your first time meeting Miss Ye. It’s normal for you to have a misunderstanding about her. You’ll slowly get over it in the future.” ”

“Cen Yuyan didn’t think so. “Everyone says that first impression is very important. The first time I met her, I already hated her so much. I definitely won’t be able to like her in the future!” ”

Cen Yuyan recalled the first time she had treated song Chenyu.

She had felt that song Chenyu was a rare good girl at first glance. Reality proved that she had not misjudged him.

Song Chenyu smiled and did not reply.

“At this moment, silence was better than words. ”
