He’s not in the office right now?

Sun Yu narrowed her eyes.

“Could it be that Cen Shaoqing had already guessed that he would come looking for him with the joint signature letter, so Cen Shaoqing could avoid it. ”

“Sun Yu continued, “It’s fine if he’s not here. It’s the same if you tell Master Five.” ”

“What is it? Tell me.”

“Sun Yu handed the envelope containing the joint signature letter to Zhou Yue, “Special Assistant Zhou, this is the joint signature letter of all the members of our department. It contains the requests of all the members of our department. Please hand it to master five personally and tell master five that all the members of our department will be on strike from now on. “When Ye Zhuo officially apologizes to professor Yue, the members of our department will officially resume work.” ”

Zhou Yue frowned. The people in Professor Yue’s hands were too bold! Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

They actually dared to threaten Cen Shaoqing!

“They probably did not know how Cen Shaoqing got his title, CEN Fifth Master, right? ”

“Zhou Yue continued, “Take the letter back. I’ll Pretend I didn’t hear what you just said!” ”

“Sun Yu looked at Zhou Yue. “Special Assistant Zhou, who are you looking down on? Since this joint letter has been written, I have no intention of bringing it back.” ”

“”Listen, Master Five is not someone you can threaten just because you want to. When the time comes, if you fail to get what you want, it will be ugly.” ”

Sun Yu’s eyes were filled with disdain.

Zhou Yue wanted to scare him?

He was still in a Daze!

“Their department was the heart of Area B. if this heart was not beating, how would the base operate? ”

“When the time came, Cen Shaoqing would definitely take the initiative to invite every single one of them back. ”

Who Was Cen Shaoqing?

CEN fifth master of the capital city.

“When he thought of Cen Shaoqing bowing his head and admitting his mistake in front of them, Zhou Yue was a little agitated. ”

“The corners of Sun Yu’s mouth curled up into a smile. “Zhou Yue, please listen well! Our Professor Yue is not someone who can be bullied just because he wants to! I will definitely hand over this joint signature letter today!” ”

“As she finished speaking.., sun Yu continued to add, “In addition, can you please tell fifth master that if he wants our professor Yue to forgive him and lead us back to the Department to work, fifth master must bring Ye Zhuo over personally to apologize to our professor Yue!” ”

“Seeing Sun Yu like this, Zhou Yue did not say anything more. ”

Sun Yu turned around and left.

Back in the department.

“A group of people surrounded him. “How is it, Brother Sun? When master five saw the joint letter, was he scared out of his wits?” ”

“Was ye Zhuo chased out of the base?”

“”It’s not enough to just chase him out of the base. This ye Zhuo must come here and apologize to professor Yue in front of all of us! Oh right, he must also apologize to Miss Tang!” ”

“After everyone had finished speaking, Sun Yu slowly spoke, “Master Five is not in his office. I gave the letter to Zhou Yue and told him that our department will be on strike from today until master five brings ye Zao to apologize to Professor Yue! Otherwise, we will never resume work!” ”

“Really?”

Sun Yu nodded. “Yes.”

“Then we don’t have to work now?”

“Sun Yu said, “Yes, everyone, let go of the work at hand. We will go home with Professor Yue!” ”

“”Oh, we will go home with Professor Yue!” ”

Everyone cheered excitedly.

Professor Yue was also a little excited. “Do all of you really want to go with me?”

“In the many years since the CEN group’s base was established, this was the first time that a collective strike had happened. ”

“”Of course!”Everyone nodded. “Professor Yue, don’t worry. We will definitely not let you suffer.” ”

“Professor Yue continued, “But the base manual says that the technicians who propose a strike will be regarded as breaking the contract and will be taken by the base’s citizens. If master five doesn’t come to apologize within three days, wouldn’t I implicate all of You?” ”

“”He won’t! Professor Yue, don’t Worry!” ”

“Our Department is the heart in Area B. could it be that master five can have a heart transplant surgery?”

How could that be possible!

“If their department could really be replaced so easily, it wouldn’t be called a heart! ”

“Therefore, this time, Cen Shaoqing had to lower his head! ”

Professor Yue was extremely grateful. He stood up and thanked him once again.

The commotion in Area B was very big.

“Soon, the other districts also found out that Professor Yue’s Department members were going on strike. ”

“When they walked out of the base, Sun Yu’s girlfriend, Shen Linlin, caught up with Sun Yu. “Sun Yu! What are you guys doing? Are you guys really going on strike?” ”

“Sun Yu smiled and said, “Do we look like we’re playing around?” ”

“After saying that, Sun Yu continued, “Linlin, haven’t you always complained that my position in Area B is too low? Just wait. After this, master five will definitely give us a promotion.” ”
