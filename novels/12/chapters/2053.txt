Only then did the secretary-general know.

“The greater the hope, the greater the disappointment. ”

“Hearing this, Zhao Dan frowned slightly and continued, “I don’t think so. Actually, this child, Qiu Di, has quite a good aptitude. As long as he experiences a little, he won’t be much worse than miss ye from before.” ”

“Perhaps because of ye Lan, Zhao Dan’s impression of Qiu Di was quite good. ”

“”Madam, if you put it that way, the difference is too great.”The secretary-general smiled and continued, “Madam must not have seen miss ye before, right?” ”

Zhao Dan nodded. “Indeed not.”

“”That’s right,”the secretary-general said. ”

“Hearing the secretary-general’s words, Zhao Dan was a little curious. ”

“What kind of person was this miss ye, to actually be able to make the secretary-general of the Allied countries have such a high evaluation? ”

“As he finished speaking, the secretary-general turned his head to look at the figure standing there. When he saw this figure, he was also a little excited. ”

This figure.

Was really too similar.

Could it be...

That it was really ye Zhuo who had returned?

Over here.

“Seeing that the situation was slowly turning against him.., qiu Di stood out and said, “How can you believe the words of a mentally ill person! ! Guangxing himself had also said that there was something wrong with his mental state! Everyone has witnessed the six clan leaders’loyalty to Miss Ye. I think everyone should be very clear about what kind of person he is!” ”

The words of a mentally ill person indeed did not have much credibility.

But the matter of Guangxing being locked in the basement was true.

And the matter of Guangyoudao killing his first wife was also true.

“Li Zi Yue smiled and said, “Qiu Di, you’re already at the end of your life now. Are you still stubborn? Miss ye is standing by your side. I want to see how you’re going to twist black and white!” ”

“”Li Zi Yue, who’s twisting the truth now?”Qiu di continued, “You keep saying that she’s Miss Ye. Then why doesn’t she even dare to show her face?” ”

“After ye Zao died, Qiu Di was also worried that she was faking her death, so she confirmed it several times. ”

“So, this definitely wasn’t ye Zao! ”

Li Zi Yue didn’t say anything

“At this moment, a clear and shallow voice appeared in the air. “You’re saying that no one dares to show their face?” ” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“With that, a hand slowly removed the cap on her head. ”

A face that was like a painting appeared in the air.

“She just stood there and did not say anything, but it already made people feel a sense of oppression, making them not dare to look directly at her. This aura that looked down on the world was something that no one could imitate. ”

It was exactly the same.

It was exactly the same.

It was her!

She was back!

“Miss Ye! Miss Ye!”

Everyone immediately cheered. “That’s great! Miss ye is finally back!”!

“Bai changhu immediately stood up from his chair. “Miss Ye! I knew that you were blessed by the heavens. You Won’t be harmed by evil people! Now that you’re back, those who harmed you can finally get their retribution!” ”

Liu Zhengting was also very excited.

“It was said that a man shouldn’t cry easily, but at this moment, those seven-foot-tall men could hardly control their emotions in the face of this scene. Tears streamed down their faces. ”

The scene was especially moving.

This kind of feeling could only be experienced by those who had experienced it.

“Seeing ye Zao standing in front of her, Qiu di panicked. ”

How could this be?

Ye Zao was clearly already dead.

What was going on?

No.

She was not ye Zao!

“You are not Miss Ye!”Qiu Di looked at Ye Zao. “You are a fake! The real ye Zao died long ago!”

“Ye Zao curled his lips slightly and the corners of his mouth curled up. “Thanks to you, I did almost die. Unfortunately, I was still a little short. I, Ye Zao, Am Back!” ”

Qiu Di could not help but step back.

“Her face did not have the slightest bit of color. She wanted to say something, but she could not even open her mouth. It was as if there was an invisible hand that tightly pinched her mouth, and her back was covered with layers of cold sweat. ”

“After saying that, ye Zao turned around to face the crowd and bent down to bow, “Ye Zao is here to thank everyone for their great love. He survived the disaster and let me see the faces of many people clearly. The situation is just as Guangxing and Li Ziyue said, a traitor has appeared in Chang Yue Country...” ”

“”I’m not a traitor! I’m Not!”The six clan leaders roared hysterically, “You Imposter, what are you trying to do! Don’t think that just because you look like Miss Ye, you can muddle through in front of everyone!” ”

“The six clan leaders are righteous. They colluded with the enemy and betrayed the country. They tortured and killed their own children and were sentenced to death!”

Every word was spoken with great force.

“As soon as these words were spoken, guards walked onto the stage. One on the left and one on the right, they escorted the six clan leaders down the stage. ”
