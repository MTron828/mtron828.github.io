“Upon hearing this, Fuduo’s face instantly turned red. ”

She was caught in the act of secretly taking a photo.

She did not expect ye Zao to discover it.

How did ye Zao discover it?

This was a little scary!

“Fuduo who reacted immediately apologized, “Miss Ye, I’m sorry. I just wanted to take a photo because you’re so good-looking. I’ll delete it Right Now!” ”

Fu duo took out her phone and deleted the photo.

Ye Zao just looked at her like that.

He didn’t say anything.

“Ye Zao was 1.73 meters tall, which was considered outstanding among the girls. ”

Fu Duo was a little over 1.6 meters tall. It was very stressful for her to be looked at like that by Ye Zao.

“Under the immense pressure, Fu duo deleted the photo. “Miss Ye, look. It’s already deleted.” ”

“It won’t happen again.”Ye Zao’s red lips parted slightly.

“”There won’t be a next time,”Fuduo said. ”

“Although she couldn’t send the photo to her brother, Fuduo could confirm that the person in front of her was the Miss ye that her brother had mentioned. ”

It had to be!

“After all, Miss Ye was a very legendary person. ”

“Looking at ye Zao’s back, Fuduo opened the dialog box with her brother. [ are you there? ] ”

Fushen quickly replied.

“[ if you have something to say, say it. ] ”

Fuduo replied: [ give me a photo of Miss Ye. ]

Fushen: [ No. ]

“Ye Zao stood at the top of the scientific research world. She did not show her face easily, so naturally, there were not many photos. ”

“[ I think I see Miss Ye. ] Fuduo did not dare to take another photo of ye Zao. She continued to type her description, [ she is very beautiful. She has phoenix eyes and is about 1.73 meters tall. Her skin is very white and her voice is a bit like a broadcasting professional. There is an extremely small mole under her right eye. ] ”

Fushen was very excited. [ where are you now? ]

[ master Yu is here. ] Fuduo replied.

Fushen was silent on the other side.

Yu Niannian was currently in the South China Sea while he was located at the northernmost tip of China. It would take at least seven to eight hours to arrive.

“Looking at her brother’s reply, Fuduo was even more certain that this was Miss Ye. She felt very uneasy. On one side was Miss Ye, and on the other side was the man she liked the most. ”

What should she do?

“At this moment, Yu Luonian’s voice sounded in the air. “Duoduo!” ”

“Coming!”Fuduo immediately trotted over.

Yu Luonian gave Fuduo a look.

“After knowing ye Zhuo’s identity, Fu Duo did not dare to act rashly again. “Young Master Yu, I have something very important to tell you.” ”

Yu sunset could only follow fu duo’s footsteps.

“Speak.”Yu sunset was already a little impatient.

Fu duo was too long-winded and could not handle a single thing well.

“Fu duo continued, “Young Master Yu, Miss Ye is really Dr. YC!” ”

“Are you done or not?”Yu sunset looked at Fuduo and frowned.

“Fuduo was also very anxious and did not know how to explain to Yu sunset. “I just asked my brother. Young Master Yu, trust me.” ”

“I’ll go look for Yi Mei’er.”Yu sunset turned around and left.

Fuduo sighed and followed Yu Sunset’s footsteps. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Yi Mei’er and Paula were not afraid of the people that Fuduo did not dare to provoke.

“In their opinion, Yu Yao had given them such an important task in his twilight years because he trusted them. Perhaps they might even have the chance to climb up to the top and become Phoenix. ”

“If they could become Mrs. Yu, their lives would be complete. ”

“Yi Mei’er came to ye Zao’s side with a wine glass. “Miss Ye, let me toast you.” ”

Ye Zao picked up a cocktail with a nice color. “Thank you.”

The chilled cocktail tasted very good. Ye Zao drank half of it in one go.

“Seeing her like this, Yi Mei’er smiled and said, “Miss ye really has a good tolerance for alcohol.” ”

“”It’s average,”ye Zao said. ”

“Yi Mei’er continued, “By the way, does miss ye know how to play golf?” ”

“”A little,”ye Zao said. ”

“Yi Mei’er smiled and said, “Then let’s go play golf?” ”

“Bring me along.”Paula jogged over.

The three of them went to play golf together.

“Yi Mei’er took the golf club that the caddy handed over. “Miss Ye, we’re going to win two out of three rounds. Since You’re a guest, you can start first.” ”

“Alright.”Ye Zao took the Golf Club.

It had been a long time since she had played golf. She did not know if she still had her skills.

She swung the first golf club.

Pa..

The white ball was in a parabolic shape and went straight into the hole.

“Yi Mei’er widened her eyes. “Miss Ye, you’re so amazing!” ”

It was rare for someone to achieve such a result with a hole in one shot.

“”It was just a coincidence,”ye Zao said calmly and then swung the second shot. ”

Pa..

Another hole in one shot.

“The next shot was the second shot, the third shot, the fourth shot... ”

“No Surprise, all hole-in-one! ”

Even the eyes of the side in old age were attracted to ye Zao.
