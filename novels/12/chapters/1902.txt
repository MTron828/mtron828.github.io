“Seeing Linda like this, Fang yinyue had an idea and continued, “Second sister-in-law, that’s really unfortunate.” ”

“What’s the matter?”Linda asked hurriedly.

“Fang yinyue continued, “Fifth Master and Miss ye are not at home for dinner today.” ”

What!

Cen Shaoqing was not at home today!

“Hearing this, Linda’s face turned pale. ”

“Cen Shaoqing wasn’t here, so wouldn’t all the work she had been doing for the past few hours have been in vain? ”

“If she had known that Cen Shaoqing wasn’t here, she wouldn’t have suffered so much! ”

“Although she didn’t help much, it was still very tiring to help in the kitchen. ”

“Linda’s body was delicate and expensive, and she had more than a dozen servants at home. When had she ever done such a thing. ”

That wasn’t right.

Fang yinyue must be lying to her.

Linda narrowed her eyes.

“Cen Shaoqing had been staying at Fang yinyue’s place for more than a week, so how could he suddenly not be here? ”

There must be a problem.

“Linda continued, “Third sister-in-law, is fifth Cen really not here?” ”

“”He’s really not here. Second Sister-in-law, why would I lie to You?”Fang yinyue knew why Linda had come over this time. She continued, “Fifth Cen went to New Year’s with his girlfriend, Miss Ye.” ”

Girlfriend?

Fifth Master Cen has a girlfriend?

How is this possible!

“Hearing this, Linda was shocked again. ”

Fang yinyue clearly wanted to introduce Li Yueyue to fifth master Cen and let Li Yueyue Soar to the sky!

How could fifth Master Cen have a girlfriend?

He must be lying to her!

“After all, Li Shuyi was more beautiful than Li Yueyue, her figure was better than Li Yueyue, and her educational background was higher than Li Yueyue. ”

“In front of Li Shuyi, Li Yueyue was nothing? ”

“As long as Li Shuyi made a move, Li Yueyue would still have a chance? ”

Fang yinyue was really scheming. She was actually still wary of her.

Did she really think she was a fool?

Could she be deceived by her?

“Linda put on a fake smile and continued, “Who is fifth master’s girlfriend?” ”

“”It’s Miss Ye,”fang yinyue continued, “Shuyi should have seen it when she came last time.” ”

“Actually, Fang yinyue’s words were also a reminder to Linda not to have any thoughts that she shouldn’t have. After all, CEN Shaoqing already had a girlfriend! ”

He didn’t want to make things ugly.

But Linda didn’t listen to him. She just thought that Fang yinyue was trying to trick her.

Taking a step back.

So what if CEN Shaoqing really had a girlfriend?

“Li Shuyi was so good-looking, why would she be afraid that CEN fifth master would not fall in love with her? ”

That was impossible!

Linda’s expression did not change as she helped to bring all the dishes to the table.

Li Erzhu and Li Sanzhu were already sitting at the dining table.

Li Shuyi and Li Yueyue were chatting.

Li Yueyue was really not used to Li Shuyi’s sudden enthusiasm.

One had to know that this cousin of hers usually held her head higher than a swan when she saw her.

“It was as if Li Yueyue was her little servant, shouting and shouting. ”

“Li Shuyi took out a treasured bracelet. “Yueyue, your skin is white. You’ll definitely look very good wearing this bracelet. I’ll give this bracelet to you.” ”

“Li Yueyue said, “Cousin, you’re too polite. No matter how white my skin is, I’m not as good-looking as you. It’s such a waste to wear such a good bracelet!” ”

Li Shuyi felt refreshed when she heard this.

At least Li Yueyue knew her place.

“She had an international appearance. Not to mention half, Li Yueyue was not even one-tenth as good-looking as her, so how could she wear her bracelet? ” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“But now that she wanted to please Li Yueyue, Li Shuyi continued, “Yueyue, you’re also very good-looking! I think this bracelet suits you the best!” ”

“”No, no, no, cousin, I really don’t deserve it.”Li Yueyue refused repeatedly. ”

“The saying goes, ‘eat the honey and take the honey.’. ”

“For Li Shuyi to suddenly become so enthusiastic, there must be a conspiracy. ”

“Although the bracelet was very beautiful and was a collector’s edition, it could not be bought on the market at present. Li Yueyue also liked it very much, but she could not accept it. ”

“Once she accepted the bracelet, the nature would change. ”

Li Shuyi was still very happy that Li Yueyue insisted on not accepting her bracelet.

This meant that Li Yueyue knew how much weight she weighed.

“Li Shuyi kept the bracelet and said with a smile, “Yueyue, since you don’t want it, then cousin will not force you.” ”

“Li Yueyue said, “I have received cousin’s goodwill.” ”

“Li Shuyi kept the bracelet in satisfaction and looked around the room before saying, “By the way, yueyue, where are your guests?” ”

Guests?

Li Yueyue was stunned. “What guests?”

“Li Shuyi continued, “Didn’t your family have guests a few days ago?”Why are you pretending to be confused? ! ”

Only then did Li Yueyue react. “They went out for the New Year.”
