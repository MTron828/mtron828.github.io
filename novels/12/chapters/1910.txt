What does Cen Shaoqing mean by this?

What does she mean that she doesn’t deserve it?

“She wants to have good looks, a good figure, and a good figure. In what way is she inferior to ye Zao? ”

No.

She was not reconciled.

“This plan could have gone smoothly, but now it was all ruined! ”

“If Li Yueyue had not called the police, then she would already be having sex with Cen Shaoqing. ”

Li Yueyue.

Damn Li Yueyue.

She would not let Li Yueyue off.

“The assistant immediately took a step forward and said, “Officer, sir, fifth master does not know this street girl.” ”

“Officer Wang nodded. “Okay, I understand. Don’t worry, we will handle this matter impartially and give you a satisfactory answer.” ”

“Okay.”Cen Shaoqing’s tone was slightly heavy. “Handle it as you should.”

The subtext of this sentence was that there was no need to give face to anyone.

“Yes.”

“”I’m not a streetwalker. It’s a misunderstanding! It’s a misunderstanding!”Li Shuyi almost cried. “Third uncle, third aunt, speak up for me!” ”

“She could not be taken away by the police. She did not want to go to jail, nor did she want to go to the detention center. ”

“I don’t have a shameless niece like you! You’re ruining the family’s reputation!”Li Sanzhu was so angry that his face was pale.

“Although Fang Yinyue didn’t say anything, her eyes said everything. ”

On the other side.

The maid came to Li Erzhu’s side.

“”Second sir, second madam.” ”

Li Erzhu and Linda were watching the New Year’s Eve party on the prairie.

“Seeing the maid come over, Linda narrowed her eyes without a trace. “Sun Wu, why are you here?” ”

“Sun Wu couldn’t speak directly about this matter. He could only say, “Second sir, second madam, our Sir wants you to come over.” ”

Li Erzhu was looking for them?

Why was Li Erzhu looking for them?

Could it be because of Li Shuyi?

“According to the plan, Li Shuyi had already become a good thing with fifth master Cen. ”

“Thinking of this, Linda’s lips curled up slightly. ”

“Fifth Master Cen had slept with Li Shuyi. According to Chinese tradition, if his parents found out, he would be responsible for Li Shuyi! ”

“At this moment, Li Sanzhu had called them over. It must be because of this matter. ”

Linda put down her teacup. “Third brother is looking for us. Is It related to the eldest miss?”

Eldest miss?

“Sun Wu was stunned. In the Li family, the only person who was addressed as eldest miss was Li Yueyue. ”

“But ever since Li Shuyi returned, the person who was addressed as eldest miss was Liu Shuyi. ”

“Sun Wu quickly reacted and continued, “Yes.” ”

The smile on Linda’s face became even wider. “Miss is now in CEN Fifth Master’s Courtyard?”

“Yes.”Sun Wu nodded.

So it really was!

Linda was very excited. She pulled Li Erzhu up from the sofa. “We’ll go now.”

The two followed Sun Wu and walked towards Cen Shaoqing’s courtyard.

“Soon, they arrived here. ”

They could see a group of people standing outside the courtyard from afar.

Linda stood on her tiptoes to take a look. The smile on her face could not be concealed.

It would be best if this matter was made known to everyone. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“The Cen family was a big family. This big family placed great importance on their reputation. Now that this matter had happened, even if Cen Shaoqing did not want to be responsible for Li Shuyi, he had to be responsible. ”

Sun Wu looked at Linda and frowned.

“It was already so late, yet Linda was still in the mood to smile! ”

“When they came to the courtyard, the two policemen had already left with Li Shuyi. ”

“Linda walked straight to Li Erzhu and Fang yinyue. “Third brother, third sister-in-law, why did you two call me here in such a hurry? Is There Something Wrong?” ”

Li Sanzhu’s expression was very ugly. “You should ask that shameless daughter of yours!”

Shameless!

Li Sanzhu actually said that Li Shuyi was shameless.

Who Was Li Sanzhu? What right did he have to criticize Li Shuyi.

“Linda put on a fake smile, “His third uncle, what you said is wrong! What do you mean by Shameless? Do you know what shameless means? Can such a thing be accomplished by wishful thinking? Doesn’t fifth master CEN have any responsibility at all? I remember that Fifth Master Cen was a guest that you invited. Our Shuyi is a pure and innocent maiden! “Fifth Master Cen must be responsible for Shuyi. And you, his second uncle, Shuyi is your biological niece. As an uncle, shouldn’t you apologize to Shuyi!” ”

Li Sanzhu was so angry that he almost laughed.

What time was this!

No one knew who gave Linda the courage.

“No Wonder Shuyi would do such a shameless thing! It turns out that she has a mother like you!”

“”San Zhu! Shut Up!”Li Erzhu stood up and said, “She is your sister-in-law! Quickly apologize to your sister-in-law!” ”
