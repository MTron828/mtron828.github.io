What she said.

How much hatred!

“The others were trying their best to attract he ziteng’s attention, but Xu Yao was different! ”

“Even if he ziteng pursued her, Xu Yao still did not want to accept him. ”

“Yang Zixuan glanced at Xu Yao and said enviously, “Yaoyao, if I were you, I wouldn’t have waited until now! The eldest young master of the He family has everything he wants. If you hesitate any longer, you will be snatched away by others!” ”

“Xu Yao enjoyed the envious gazes of others and continued, “Zixuan, what’s there to be envious about? One day, you will also find your own Prince Charming.” ”

What kind of Prince Charming could be compared to he ziteng?

The He family was the head of the ten great clans.

“He ziteng was also the only heir of the He family. Once Xu Yao married into the He family, she would be the mistress of the He family. ”

“Yang Zixuan smiled and said, “I hope so! Yaoyao, I’m serious. Don’t hesitate anymore. If you miss this village, you won’t have this shop anymore.” ”

Xu Yao smiled and did not continue speaking.

“Yang Zixuan continued, “Yaoyao, I’ll go over there and take a look.” ”

“You go ahead.”Xu Yao nodded.

“Yang Zixuan walked to a young woman of the same age and held her arm. “Xiaoxue, Xu Yao’s life is really too good!” ”

“What’s Wrong?”Zhang Xue looked at Yang Zixuan.

“Yang Zixuan continued, “Have you heard? He ziteng is chasing after her.” ”

He ziteng was a famous and influential person in the circle. Who Didn’t want to be a member of the He Family?

Unfortunately.

He ziteng’s standards were too high. He didn’t take a liking to them at all.

He didn’t expect that he ziteng would take the initiative to pursue Xu Yao in the end.

What did Xu Yao have?

“She looked average, her figure was average, and her family background was average. ”

“Before this, when Xu Yao was in the socialite circle, she was the one who had her photo taken with everyone photoshopped. ”

Unexpectedly...

“In the blink of an eye, Xu Yao stood at the most eye-catching C spot. ”

“Zhang Xue’s eyes were filled with disdain. “Who knows if it’s true! With her looks, is she worthy of he ziteng pursuing her?” ”

Someone had once tried to set Zhang Xue up with He ziteng.

“In the end, he ziteng did not even look at he ziteng. ”

“Now that Xu Yao had taken advantage of him, Zhang Xue naturally felt uncomfortable. ”

“Other than feeling uncomfortable, she did not want to admit that it was true. ”

“Yang Zixuan said, “From the looks of it, she should not be lying. Moreover, my brother also said that he ziteng is indeed interested in her.”Yang Zixuan’s brother worked at the He Corporation. In the past few days, the matter of he ziteng pursuing Xu Yao had been made known to everyone, it was already known to everyone. ”

“Hearing that, Zhang Xue was upset. She continued, “But why did I hear that he ziteng hasn’t spoken to her for a week?” ”

Yang Zixuan was very surprised. “Is that true?”

“”Of course it’s true!”Zhang Xue said, “I think he ziteng is just toying with her! But she really thinks she’s something! Disgusting!” ”

“Yang Zixuan nodded. “Little Xue, you’re right. He Ziteng is definitely just fooling around with her.” ”

“Very soon, these words spread throughout the entire hall. ”

The socialites looked at Xu Yao and discussed animatedly.

Xu Yao’s expression changed and she sat on pins and needles. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“At the most critical moment, Xu Yao’s phone suddenly rang. ”

She took out her phone to take a look.

It was he ziteng.

“After deliberately pausing for a few seconds, Xu Yao swiped the phone and answered, “Hello, ziteng.” ”

“”Yaoyao, where are you right now?” ”

“Xu Yao narrowed her eyes. Didn’t those people at the party look down on her? Just you wait, I’ll be able to slap her in the face soon! Especially that Zhang Xue! ”

“With her background in the Zhang family, she was able to make a name for herself in the socialite circle. She really felt that she was someone important! ”

Especially since Zhang Xue had once overestimated herself and wanted to marry he ziteng.

Zhang Xue did not even look in the mirror to see what she was like!

How could she be a match for he ziteng?

How Shameless!

“Xu Yao continued, “I’m attending a good friend’s birthday party at Jin de Lu.” ”

“Birthday Party? Then have you been drinking?”He ziteng asked.

Xu Yao picked up her glass and took a sip of champagne. “A little.”

“Hearing that Xu Yao had been drinking, he ziteng said nervously, “Are you alright now? I’ll drive over to pick you up right away.” ”

“Will it be too much trouble for You?”Xu Yao asked.

“Hearing this, he ziteng thought he was hearing things. ”

“After all, if it were in the past, Xu Yao would have rejected him directly. ”

“But today, Xu Yao didn’t reject him! ”

Did this mean that he had a chance?

“Thinking of this, he ziteng was very excited. He immediately said, “It’s no trouble. It’s no trouble at all. I’ll come over right away.” ”
