Translator: 549690339

“If this were to be known, wouldn’t it be a joke? ! ”

“”Mom, it’s getting late. You should go back and rest early.”Lin Jincheng rubbed his temples tiredly. “Auntie Wu, send the old lady back to her room.” ”

“If it wasn’t for the fact that Old Lady Lin had raised him and then raised Lin Ze, Lin Jincheng would have turned hostile long ago. ”

“”Old Mrs. Lin, shall I send you back?”Auntie Wu walked to Old Mrs. Lin’s side. ”

Old Mrs. Lin was so angry that her face turned pale. She waved Auntie Wu’s hand away. “I don’t need you to send me back!”

The next morning.

“Lin Qingxuan went for a run in the garden as usual. Coincidentally, he bumped into ye Zao, who had come out for a morning run this morning. ”

“”Zao Zao, Good Morning.” ”

“Fourth uncle.”

“Lin qingxuan continued, “Zao Zao, thank you for the ointment. My face is all better now.” ”

“We’re all family. Fourth uncle is too polite.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“The Morning Air was very good, and the garden was filled with birds and flowers. Zhao shuning was not in the garden this morning, so Lin Qingxuan chatted with ye Zhonghua as she ran. ”

“From the conversation, ye Zhonghua learned that Lin Qingxuan was very eager to have a child of her own. ”

Ye Zhonghua frowned slightly.

“Seeing how afraid Lin Qingxuan was of Zhao shuning, she thought that Lin Qingxuan did not like children. ”

“But if Lin Qingxuan liked children, why was Zhao Shuning so arrogant in front of Lin Qingxuan? ”

“In a normal family, if one of the spouses couldn’t have children, they would either end in a divorce or have a harmonious family. ”

“Unlike Lin Qingxuan, who was afraid that Zhao shuning would be like a mouse seeing a cat. ”

This was a bit abnormal.

“Just as the two of them were talking about college, Lin Qingxuan asked ye Zao if he had found a boyfriend at school. ”

“Ye Zao smiled and shook his head. He continued, “Fourth uncle, how did you and fourth aunt meet when you were young? Were you university classmates?” ”

“Lin Qingxuan said, “I met your fourth aunt on a blind date.” ”

He and Zhao Shuning did not have any romantic foundation.

“Lin Qingxuan was a very obedient son. Back then, he had a very good relationship with his first love in university. ”

“Unfortunately, the family conditions of his first love were too poor and was despised by Old Lady Lin. In order to completely stop Lin Qingxuan’s thoughts, Old Lady Lin made the decision to arrange a blind date for Lin Qingxuan. ”

“Zhao shuning and Old Lady Lin’s maiden family had some relations. In addition, the Zhao family followed the path of official career. The combination of official and business was beneficial to Lin Qingxuan’s future development. Therefore, this matter was decided. ”

“After the marriage, Zhao shuning had been infertile. Old Lady Lin was anxious and pulled the couple to the hospital for a checkup. ”

“She thought it was Zhao shuning’s problem, but she didn’t expect it to be Lin Qingxuan’s problem. ”

“However, not only did Zhao shuning not ask for a divorce, but he took the initiative to blame her for the problem. He took the initiative to announce to the public that she couldn’t have a child. ”

Until today.

“Other than him and Old Lady Lin, no one else in the Lin family knew about this matter. Not even his three brothers and Lin Jincheng knew about it. ”

A blind date?

Ye Zao raised his eyebrows without a trace.

“He thought that he and Zhao shuning were in a free relationship, but he didn’t expect that they met on a blind date. ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Then fourth uncle, your relationship with fourth aunt must be very good, right?” ”

“Lin Qingxuan said, “Your fourth aunt is a rare and good woman.” ”

Good Woman?

Which good woman was like Zhao Shuning?

“Ye Zao suspected that Lin Qingxuan was joking, but she had no evidence. ”

It seemed that there must be a story between the couple.

Ye Zhuo narrowed his eyes.

At 11 o’clock in the afternoon.

Feng Qianhua came punctually to deliver the health-preserving soup to Old Lady Lin.

“Zhao shuning’s face had completely recovered from the bruise caused by the ointment. At this moment, she was chatting with Old Lady Lin in the room. ”

Feng Qianhua had just walked to the door when she heard Old Lady Lin Sigh.

“”Aunt Lin, sighing is bad for your health. A smile can only last ten years.” ”

“Feng Xianxian ran in with a smile. “Grandma, who made you angry again? Tell me, I’ll help you teach her a lesson.” ”

“Seeing Feng Xianxian, old madam Lin couldn’t stop smiling. ”

“Such a good granddaughter, but it was a pity that she didn’t belong to her family. ”

“Feng Qianhua handed the health soup to Feng Xianxian. “Xianxian, give this soup to your grandma to drink.” ”

“”Okay, Mom.” ”

“Feng Qianhua turned to look at Zhao shuning. “Shuning, I heard that the Roses in the garden have bloomed. Will you accompany me to take a look?” ”

Zhao shuning knew that Feng Qianhua was implying something. He smiled and stood up. “Sure.”

The two of them went to the garden.

“Feng Qianhua asked with concern, “Shuning, how’s Your Brother’s matter? Is It Serious?” ”

Zhao shuning’s brows furrowed tightly when he mentioned this matter.

“Feng Qianhua patted Zhao shuning’s hand and sighed, “If I knew it would be so troublesome to change his name, you shouldn’t have interfered in the first place.” ”

“”It’s all that B * Tch Ye Zhuo’s fault!”Zhao shuning’s eyes were full of viciousness. “If she hadn’t instigated it, Jin city wouldn’t have done such a thing to my brother!” ”

“Feng Qianhua continued, “I have a way to get you to kick her out.” ”

“”What Way?”Zhao shuning was like a drowning man, grasping at the last straw. ”

“”She’s still a girl after all. They say that if a daughter marries someone else, she’ll be out of sight and out of mind, right?” ”

“A bright light flashed in Zhao Shuning’s eyes, but it quickly dimmed. “But I’m just her fourth aunt...” ”

“”You can give Auntie Lin Advice,”Feng Qianhua continued, “No matter what, Auntie Lin is her grandmother. Isn’t it natural for a grandmother to speak to her granddaughter?” ”

“Yes! Qianhua! You’re right!”Zhao shuning grabbed Feng Qianhua’s hand. “I think the Li family in the east of the city is not bad!”
