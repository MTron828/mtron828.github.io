Translator: 549690339

Zheng Wanyin could no longer listen to anything.

She only wanted to look for the CEO to make the decision right away.

She wanted the CEO to seek justice for her.

“Liu Jingjing quickly caught up to Zheng Wanyin. “Wanyin, what happened to you?” ”

“Zheng Wanyin took a deep breath and tried hard to calm herself down. “Jingjing, don’t follow me. I have something to ask the CEO.” ”

“”Wanyin, did you get 3A?”Liu Jingjing asked. ”

3A?

She was a joke now.

“Even a fool like Liu Jingjing got 2a, but she only got 1a! ”

It was simply a joke.

Zheng Wanyin felt extremely uncomfortable and didn’t know how to say it.

At this moment.

A Cry of surprise came from the crowd.

“Holy shit!”

“Oh my God!”

“Bai Xiaosu actually took the 3A exam!”

3A?

Bai Xiaosu?

“When he heard this, Liu Jingjing immediately turned his head to look over. ”

He saw Bai Xiaosu following behind Ling Yue and walking forward.

Ling Yue was a training specialist.

“From the looks of it, Bai Xiaosu was following behind Ling Yue to do the handover work. ”

Bai Xiaosu took the 3A exam and was about to be promoted to a training specialist.

Zheng Wanyin also saw Bai Xiaosu.

How could someone like Bai Xiaosu get into the A-list exam.

It must be ye Zhuo’s doing.

Ye Zhuo used his identity to swap her and Bai Xiaosu’s results.

Bai Xiaosu’s A-list should be hers!

“Bai Xiaosu was really shameless. It was one thing for him to be special in the group, but now he was replacing her results! ”

Zheng Wanyin pinched her fingers. The anger in her eyes was about to spill out. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

No.

She could not let such a thing happen.

A person like ye Zhuo was even less qualified to be the chief assessment officer.

She had tainted this fair assessment!

“Thinking of this, Zheng Wanyin pushed Liu Jingjing away and walked towards the CEO’s office. ”

Liu Jingjing was caught off guard and was pushed so hard that he staggered and almost fell.

“Seeing Zheng Wanyin like this, the others immediately surrounded her curiously. “What happened to Zheng Wanyin?” ”

“Did Zheng Wanyin get 3A?”

“Did Zheng Wanyin not do well in the exam?”

“”From the looks of her, could it be that she didn’t even get 2a?” ”

“I don’t think so!”

“Then Zheng Wanyin is too miserable!”

“”Zheng Wanyin is usually much more outstanding than Liu Jing. Now that Liu Jing has gotten 2a, and Zheng Wanyin didn’t even get 2a, she must be feeling very down!” ”

“No wonder! Why is she so angry!”

“Hearing that, Liu Jingjing said, “What nonsense are you guys talking about! Wanyin is so amazing, how can she not even get into 2A! She must have something else to do!” ”

“Zheng Wanyin was usually very hard-working, and she had been preparing for this exam for a long time. ”

“If she could get into 2a, Zheng Wanyin would at least get into 3A. ”

Zheng Wanyin walked to the CEO’s office and took a deep breath before knocking on the door.

“Soon, the CEO’s voice came from inside. “Come in.” ”

Zheng Wanyin pushed the door open and entered.

“When he saw Zheng Wanyin, the CEO smiled and said, “It’s wanyin. Take a seat.” ”

“Zheng Wanyin was a junior that he had high hopes for. Back then, she had entered the ABA with excellent results. In this assessment, Zheng Wanyin could at least get 2a. Now that Zheng Wanyin had pushed the door open and entered, the CEO was not surprised. ”

“Zheng Wanyin did not sit down. Instead, she said, “CEO, I would like to ask you a question.” ”

Ask a question.

“The CEO was stunned for a moment before saying, “Go ahead.” ”

“Zheng wanyin continued, “I would like to ask, what is the assessment criteria for this assessment?” ”

“With her abilities, how could she only get 1A? ”

There was clearly someone who was using the public to take revenge on her!

She had to seek justice for herself.

“The CEO smiled and said, “Of course, it will be judged according to the results. It will be fair and just.” ”

“”Fair?”Zheng Wanyin laughed self-deprecatingly. “CEO, do you really think it’s Fair?” ”

“What do you mean by that?”The CEO asked.

Zheng Wanyin placed the report card on the table. “Take a look at this.”

The CEO picked up the report card and his expression changed when he saw it.

1A?

“Based on Zheng Wanyin’s usual performance, this shouldn’t be the case. ”

“Zheng wanyin continued, “You think it’s unbelievable too, right?” ”

“The CEO put down the report card and continued, “Wanyin, everyone makes mistakes. Although you didn’t do well this time, I believe that you will definitely be able to pass the management level and above next time.” ”

“Zheng Wanyin took a deep breath and said, “CEO, don’t you think that this is very strange? I usually get 2A and above results in my exams, but this time, I barely passed the 1A mark.” ”
