Translator: 549690339

Master Cao did not feel that man Wen was a threat at all.

“In this world, there were only the upper class and the lower class. There were also trash and geniuses. ”

“To man Xing, not only was man Wen not a threat, but he was also a stepping stone. ”

“With a person like man Wen who had a bad record compared to him, man Xing’s excellence would be even more apparent. ”

“Man Xing frowned slightly and turned to look at Master Cao. “Master, don’t you think it’s a little strange?” ”

“How is it strange?”Master Cao asked.

“MAN XING continued, “How do you think man Wen got on the list?”Based on Man Wen’s usual performance, how could he be qualified to get on the list and compete with her on a fair basis? If Man Wen could get on the list, did it mean that he had such ambitions? Thinking of this, man Xing’s eyebrows twitched, and she suddenly felt a sense of threat that she had never felt before. ”

It was very strange!

“Master Cao smiled and said, “Xing ‘er, your focus shouldn’t be on this good-for-nothing now.” ”

Master Cao had watched man Wen grow up.

Master Cao knew very well what kind of person he was.

How could he have such ambition for a useless person like man Wen?

It was a fantasy!

“”But I feel that this matter is a little strange,”man Xing continued. “Based on my understanding of Man Wen, he shouldn’t have such ambitions.” ”

It was because of this that man Xing had never taken man Wen seriously.

But now...

“Man Wen, who had always been like a salted fish, suddenly had the idea of coveting the presidency. ”

What on Earth had happened?

Could it be that man Wen had been pretending all these years?

“When this idea came into his mind, cold sweat broke out on man Xing’s back, and he was a little flustered. ”

“What’s so strange about this?”Master Cao narrowed his eyes slightly. “I think this must have something to do with your father’s old subordinates.”

“Many old subordinates of Man Jiang and Shan had watched man Wen grow up, and there were many people who valued boys over girls. ”

“Some people valued men over women. No matter how strong a woman was, they would not think she was that strong. ”

“Perhaps, the person who helped man Wen get on the list was someone who valued men over women! ”

Man Xing looked at master Cao. “Then who do you think this person is?”

“Master Cao shook his head. “I can’t tell you who he is. How about this, I’ll go back and investigate.” ”

“”En.”Man Xing nodded and said uneasily, “Master, I suspect now...” ”

“Suspect what?”Master Cao asked.

“MAN XING continued, “I suspect that man Wen has been hiding his clumsiness all these years.” ”

“Hearing this, master Cao laughed out loud. ”

Hiding his clumsiness?

How was that possible!

How could a trash like man Wen think of hiding his clumsiness?

“”Xing ‘er, you’re thinking too much,”master Cao said. ”

“Seeing master Cao Like This, man Xing also began to doubt his own thoughts. He continued, “But if he wasn’t hiding his true self, how could he be on the list?” ”

“”Didn’t I just say that it must be because of your father’s old subordinates?”Master Cao continued, “If man Wen knew to hide his true self, he wouldn’t have become like this.” ” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Man Xing frowned slightly.

“Master Cao smiled, “Xing ‘er, just relax. Man Wen’s name on the list is just a head count. He won’t do much. Now that so many people are supporting you, what are you worried about!”What About Man Wen? How many people could support man Wen? ”

“The people behind the scenes who helped man Wen had a way to get man Wen on the list, but they couldn’t help man Wen canvass votes. ”

“”If Manwen wants to get that position, unless...”at this point, master Cao paused. ”

“Manxing immediately asked, “Unless what?” ”

“Master Cao continued, “Unless there’s a big force behind him!” ”

Big Force?

Was there a big force in Manwen?

Those who were together with Manwen were all people of all walks of life!

“”So, Xing ‘er, you don’t have to worry at all,”master Cao continued, “Oh right, you can start preparing for that matter.” ”

Man Xing was stunned for a moment before she nodded.

“”Keep your hands and feet clean,”master Cao instructed. ”

“”Mm.”A strange look flashed across man Xing’s eyes. “Oh right, master, Can I go and say goodbye to them?” ”

“Upon hearing this, master Cao Glanced at man Xing. He wanted to reject her, but he swallowed the words that were on the tip of his tongue. ”

“No matter what, Man Jiangshan and his wife were her parents. As children, man Xing should not be so heartless. ”

“”If you want to go, go and take a look,”master Cao said, “But don’t let anyone see anything strange.” ”

“”Yes, I know.”Man Xing nodded. ”

“Master Cao stood up, “Then I’ll go back first. After you go to prison, prepare for the election.” ”
