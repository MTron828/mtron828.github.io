Cen Yuyan felt that what song Chenyu said was very right.

“Since she liked it, she had to say it out loud.”

Hiding was not her style.

“”Chenyu, I know what to do.””

“Song Chenyu smiled and said, “Yuyan, I wish you success. Lu Xiu is a little older than me. If the two of you succeed, you’ll be my sister-in-law in the future.””

“Cen Yuyan’s face turned red from being called sister-in-law, and her heart beat a little faster.”

“When the two of them walked to the stream again, Cen Yuyan looked at Lu Xiu. “Lu Xiu, I have something to tell you. Let’s go over there?””

Lu Xiu glanced at song Chenyu.

Song Chenyu smiled at Lu Xiu.

“Seeing this smile, Lu Xiu put down all the doubts in his heart and followed Cen Yuyan’s footsteps to the side.”

“Song Chenyu looked at the backs of the two people, and the corners of her mouth curled up slightly.”

“Cen Yuyan brought Lu Xiu behind a huge banyan tree and stopped. Facing the handsome Lu Xiu, she suddenly had a kind of nervousness that she didn’t know where to begin.”

“Lu Xiu looked at Cen Yuyan. “Miss Cen, if you have anything to say, just say it.””

“Cen Yuyan swallowed her throat, and raised her head to meet Lu Xiu’s eyes. “Lu Xiu.””

“Yes.”

“Cen Yuyan’s hands were clasped together, but she didn’t know how to say the words that were on the tip of her tongue. “Lu, Lu Xiu, i...””

Lu Xiu looked at Cen Yuyan with impatience in his eyes.

“Through song Chenyu, he roughly knew Cen Yuyan’s thoughts.”

“Actually, even if song Chenyu didn’t say it, he knew that Cen Yuyan liked him.”

But Lu Xiu didn’t have any feelings for Cen Yuyan.

He liked girls who looked more reserved like song Chenyu.

Cen Yuyan...

Was too bold.

Not suitable for him.

“Compared to Song Chenyu, Cen Yuyan was more or less like a clown.”

“Seeing that Cen Yuyan didn’t say anything for a long time, Lu Xiu continued, “Miss Cen, if you have something to say, can you say it quickly?””

“Cen Yuyan took a deep breath and couldn’t care about anything else. She looked at Lu Xiu and said in one go, “Lu Xiu! I like you! I want you to be my boyfriend!””

“After she finished speaking in one breath, Cen Yuyan’s heart was finally relieved. She looked at Lu Xiu with anticipation in her eyes.”

She was waiting for Lu Xiu’s answer.

What if Lu Xiu suddenly liked her and saw her?

Who could say for sure if he liked this kind of thing?

“Besides, she wasn’t much worse than ye Zhuo.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Moreover, her family background was so good.”

“As long as Lu Xiu agreed to be with her, he would be Cen Shaoqing’s brother-in-law in the future.”

“”I’m sorry, I already have someone I like.”Lu Xiu’s tone was indifferent.”

Someone I like.

“Even though Cen Yuyan was mentally prepared, she still found it difficult to accept it. Her eyes turned red instantly. “Who is the person you like?””

“I have no comment.”

“Is it ye Zhuo?”Cen Yuyan continued to ask.

“”No,”Lu Xiu directly denied.”

He only admired ye Zhuo.

He didn’t have any messy thoughts.

It wasn’t Ye Zhuo?

Cen Yuyan narrowed her eyes. “Then who is it? Do I know her?”

“”I’m sorry, this is my privacy.”Lu Xiu looked at CEN Yuyan and continued, “Miss Cen, there are many good men in this world. I believe that you will meet someone better in the future. It’s me who can’t match up to you.””

“You can match up to me!”Cen Yuyan almost blurted out.

“I’m sorry.”Lu Xiu bent down towards Cen Yuyan and walked to the side.

Cen Yuyan squatted on the spot and sobbed.

This was the first time she had been rejected by someone since she was born.

In the past.

“No matter who she fancied, even if it was someone with a girlfriend, as long as she made a move, she would definitely be able to get it.”

But this time...

She was actually rejected.

She was unwilling.

Cen Yuyan was very unwilling.

“When she saw Lu Xiu walking over, song Chenyu immediately went up to him and asked in a low voice, “You rejected Yuyan?””

“Yes.”Lu Xiu nodded.

Song Chenyu frowned tightly. “You clearly know that Yuyan is my friend. How can you reject her?”

Lu Xiu looked at song Chenyu. “Because I only have you in my heart. I only want to protect you.”

Song Chenyu sighed. “You should go back first. Yuyan definitely doesn’t want to see you now.”

“Then what do you guys do?”Lu Xiu continued.

“Song Chenyu said, “I’ll get the chauffeur to pick us up. You Don’t have to worry about us.””

“Lu Xiu hesitated for a moment before saying, “Then I’ll go back first.””

“Go back.”

Lu Xiu drove away.

“Song Chenyu then walked to Cen Yuyan’s side and squatted down to comfort Cen Yuyan. “Yuyan, isn’t it just a man? It’s nothing. He, Lu Xiu, doesn’t like you. There are plenty of people who like you.””
