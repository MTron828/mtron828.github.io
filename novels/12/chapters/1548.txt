“Lin Ze nodded very seriously. “Father, I’ve thought it through. I want to give my child a complete family!””

“When mentioning the word ‘complete family’, Lin Jincheng also felt a little guilty. It was all because of him that he was unable to give Lin ze a complete family back then.”

“Ye Shu immediately asked, “What’s That Girl’s name? Is she the same age as you?””

“”Zhang Qingqing, the same age as me,”Lin ze said.”

“”Then, have you thought about whether you want to live at home or outside after you get married?”Lin Jincheng continued to ask.”

“Old Mrs. Lin continued, “Of course I want to live at home! It’s so lively at home. Ah Shu, you can look after the children when you’re free! You can also look after his wife when she’s in confinement!””

“”Ah Ze, what do you think?”Lin Jincheng raised his head to look at Lin Ze.”

“Lin Ze said, “I think Grandma is right.”He and Zhang Qingqing did not have any feelings to begin with, and they would not have any feelings after marriage. He could not let the child grow up in a cold environment and live in the Lin family, he could let the child feel more love.”

Lin Jincheng nodded. “Alright then. I’ll get someone to renovate the Hibiscus garden and make it your wedding room.”

“Just do as you say.”Lin Ze didn’t have any objections.

“Ye Shu continued, “When are you going to bring that girl back for us to see! or we can go and see her too! Also, her parents are pregnant. No matter what, we have to pay them a visit...”she was already pregnant, these things had to be arranged as soon as possible. If they were to be delayed any longer, it would be bad for both sides’reputations!”

“”Father and mother, I’ll leave these matters to you!””

“Lin Jincheng sighed. “You’re our son. As parents, it’s only right for us to take care of these matters for you! As long as you’ve thought it through and don’t regret it, it’s fine!””

“Lin Ze said, “I don’t regret it.””

“Since things had come to this point, how could he still have the chance to regret it!”

“By the time ye Zhuo found out about this, it was already the afternoon of the second day. She had just returned from the base when she was pulled over by Ye Shu.” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“When he found out that Lin Ze had a girlfriend and that the woman was pregnant for a month, ye Zao frowned slightly. It would be a lie if he said that he was not surprised.”

“Although Lin ze was usually quiet and indulged in silence, he was not a casual person.”

Ye Zao could not believe that he had gotten a girl pregnant.

“After hearing this, Ye Zao turned around and left.”

“”Zao Zao, where are you going!”Ye Shu raised her voice and asked.”

“To find my brother!”Ye Zao said.

Ye Zao walked all the way to Lin Ze’s room.

The door was open.

“Standing at the door, Lin Ze could be seen sitting in front of the computer desk. His back was straight, but his face was full of loneliness.”

“Ye Zao had never seen Lin ze like this before. Perhaps it was because of the twins, but at this moment, her heart was also tightly clenched.”

It was stifling and a little uncomfortable.

It was obvious that Lin Ze did not want to marry Zhang Qingqing of his own accord.

Ye Zao reached out and knocked on the door. “Brother.”

“Lin Ze looked back slightly, and the corners of his mouth curled up into a pale arc. “Zao Zao.””

“Ye Zao walked inside, moved a stool, and sat down beside Lin Ze. “Brother, I’ve heard everything from Mom. Are you sure you weren’t tricked?””

“Lin Ze said, “I don’t think so.””

“Ye Zhuo stood up from the chair and said, “Give Me Zhang Qingqing’s phone number.””

Lin Ze reported a string of numbers.

Ye Zhuo entered his phone number and then walked outside to make a call.

“Two minutes later, Ye Zhuo walked in. “Brother, I’m going out for a while.””

Lin Ze nodded.

Ye Zhuo drove to a high-end restaurant.

“By the time she arrived, Zhang Qingqing had already arrived.”

“It was rare for Zhang Qingqing to remove her exquisite makeup. She had a plain face and was wearing a maternity outfit that protected her from radiation. No matter how she looked at it, she looked like a good girl.”

“Looking at the girl who was walking towards her, Zhang Qingqing was stunned.”

“The girl was wearing a black windbreaker and a pair of Martin boots of the same color. Her jade-like facial features seemed to be covered with a layer of frost. When she walked, her aura was fully unleashed. She looked so cool and cold that it made people shudder.”

“Just as Zhang Qingqing was slightly stunned, an extremely faint voice came from above her head. A powerful pressure was emitted in the air.”

“Zhang Qingqing?”

“Zhang Qingqing looked up and saw the girl standing against the light. She could not see the expression on her face clearly. Although her tone was faint, it was powerful.”
