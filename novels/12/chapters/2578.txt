Translator: 549690339

Dog Two was a very realistic person. He would not easily make promises. He would definitely keep his promises.

“Then who will be in charge of our family in the future?”An Lizi continued to ask.

“Dog Two was silent for a moment before he continued, “You make the decisions on small matters. If there’s a big matter, we can negotiate.”Communication was a bridge to increase their relationship. There were some things that could be solved by one person, some things could not be solved by one person at all. ”

“”In your opinion, what is a big matter and what is a small matter?”An Lizi looked at dog two and asked. ”

“Dog two smiled and said, “Such things will happen in life. Some things can only be known after they happen. Don’t be anxious.” ”

How should she put it? Dog Two’s answer made an Lizi feel that marriage was somewhat different from what she had imagined.

“She felt a little uncomfortable, but she couldn’t tell what it was about. ”

“Dog two hugged an Lizi’s shoulder and said, “Lizi, don’t worry. I will definitely give you a happy home.” ”

“”Then can’t you listen to me in Everything?”An lizi continued, “Just like Master Five and Zhonghua?” ”

“Although dog two was also very good, an Lizi still envied the way ye Zhonghua and Cen Shaoqing got along. ”

The feeling of being held in the palm of someone’s hand all the time was really different.

“Dog two chuckled, “I’ve said it before. People are different from each other, and the way they handle things is also different. “Moreover, I don’t know how to say sweet words, and I also don’t know how to use lies to make girls happy. “If there’s anything uncomfortable in the process of getting along with you, I’ll say it. “It’s the same for you. If I do something wrong, as long as you tell me, I will definitely change.” ”

“At this moment, an Lizi only wanted to say one word to buttface. ”

Straight. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

But he was different from a traditional straight man.

“What are you daydreaming about?”Buttface patted an Lizi on the head.

“An lizi smiled and said, “I thought you were straight.” ”

“Dog two continued, “You may say sweet words, but you can’t do it in action. What’s so good about this kind of person? I can assure you that I’m a person who keeps his word.” ”

“You say it like it makes sense.”An Lizi chuckled.

“”It doesn’t make sense. It makes sense.”dog two continued, “I’m a person who is suitable for living, so I can give you the life you want.” ”

An Lizi nodded.

Li hang stood by the side and listened to their conversation.

He could tell that Ouyang Cheng didn’t like an Lizi that much.

“If he really liked an Lizi, he wouldn’t be so perfunctory to an Lizi. ”

An Lizi was also a fool. She couldn’t even hear the perfunctory words. He didn’t know how she survived in this cannibalistic rich family.

“Obviously, the life of a wealthy family was not suitable for an Lizi. ”

Li Hang looked at Ouyang Cheng again.

He was 1.85 meters tall and had handsome features. He was a standard handsome man with a thick complexion.

He just didn’t know what his family background was like.

Li hang narrowed his eyes and walked to Wang Bin’s side.

“You’re going to wechat?”Wang bin turned his head to look at Li Hang.

“Li hang smiled and said, “I just went to help you ask Lizi.” ”

“At this point, she paused and continued, “Guess what she said?” ”

“What did she say?”Wang bin turned to look at Li Hang.

“Li hang continued, “Actually, she didn’t say much. She just felt that she looked down on you from the inside out. I was wondering how you offended her? I’m quite curious.” ”

“Li Hang’s words didn’t clearly show how much an Lizi hated Wang bin, but it made Wang bin extremely angry. ”

Wang bin snorted coldly. “She thought that a sparrow could really fly to the top and become a Phoenix!”

“Li hang smiled and said, “I don’t know if a sparrow can become a phoenix, but I know that she has already flown to the top!” ”

“Speaking up to this point, Li hang sighed softly. “From now on, we and Lizi won’t be from the same world!” ”

These words could be said to be extremely harsh.

“After all, an Lizi used to be from the same world as them. In fact, an Lizi was even inferior to them. ”

“But now, an Lizi had actually transformed into someone from the upper class, and they were still the same as before. ”

Even people who had a little bit of self-esteem could not withstand such a blow.

“Not to mention Wang Bin, who was an extremely chauvinistic person. ”

He simply could not stand such a thing.

“Wang bin continued, “As the saying goes, who knows what will happen in the future!” ”

“Li hang curled the corners of his lips. “That’s true. By the way, do you know who Lizi’s boyfriend is? How is his family environment?” ”

Wang Bin had long figured out dog two’s background.

“He had originally wanted to find a sense of superiority from the middle, but he did not expect that the more he heard, the more depressed he became. ”

“Wang bin continued, “That Ouyang Cheng is a local of the capital city. His parents are both white-collar workers of large enterprises. Ouyang Cheng himself set up a company two years ago. He was also lucky. His luck has been very good these two years. I heard that he has already arranged to go public.” ”

“Hearing this, Li Hang said in disbelief, “Really?” ”

“”Yes.”Wang bin nodded. Although he was not willing to admit that this was true, it was true. ”

“Li hang smiled and said, “That’s why I said that Lizi was lucky. Not only did she find a rich stepfather, but now she found a rich boyfriend. People like us are really envious of this fate!” ”

“”They haven’t gotten married yet! Who said they can’t be envious? Besides, many people can still get divorced even if they get married!”At this point, wang bin raised his head to look at Li Hang and said with a smile, “I realized that you’re not worse than an Lizi. Your figure is even better than hers. Maybe you can marry better than an Lizi in the future.” ”

“Hearing that, Li Hang looked at himself and said with a smile, “Thank you.” ”

“Wang bin Said, “I’m telling the truth. There are so many powerful people here today. Work Hard.” ”

“Li hang smiled and said, “It’s better to let fate take its course.” ”

“Although he said that, Li hang already had an answer and goal in his heart. ”

“After saying that, Li hang continued, “Don’t worry. I’ll try my best to get Zhao Pingting’s wechat for you. I’ll go over there first.” ”

“Go.”

Li hang came to the other side of the banquet hall.

An Lizi was not there.

“Buttface was talking to Fat Tiger and Mozzie, and Lin Ze was also standing by the side. ”

“Li hang narrowed his eyes, and the corners of his mouth curled up into a beautiful arc. Then, he walked over to the side of the few people. ”

“Cousin-in-law.”Li Hang walked over with a smile.

“Buttface was stunned for a moment. Then, he looked at Li Hang. After searching for a long time in his mind, he finally found information about Li Hang. ”

“”Cousin Li Hang.”He originally wanted to call Li hang directly, but he felt that it was a little rude, so he added a cousin after his name. ”

“Li hang smiled and said, “Why don’t I see Lizi?” ”

“”She has something to do,”buttface said. ”

“”I see.”Li hang smiled and said, “Time really flies. In my impression, Lizi has always been a child who hasn’t grown up.” ”

Only children would be so childish as to ask their boyfriends to listen to her in everything.

“Dog two said, “It’s pretty fast.” ”

“Li hang continued, “Brother-in-law, aren’t you going to introduce these people?” ”

“Dog two immediately reacted and introduced with a smile, “These three are my best brothers. This is Lin Ze, this is Chu Yan, and this is Li Wen.” ”

Chu Yan was the name of Fat Tiger.

“Actually, Fat Tiger was not fat at all. The reason why he was called this name was because he had been quite fat before he entered primary school. ”

“After entering junior high school, he began to lose weight. ”

“Li hang shook hands with them one by one. “Mr. Lin, Mr. Chu, Mr. Li, Hello. I’m Li Hang. Mu Zi Li, Qihang’s hang.” ”

“After getting to know each other, Li Hang took out his phone. “Shall we add on wechat?” ”

“After all, he was a relative of an Lizi. Although Lin Ze, a married man, was a little resistant, he still added Li Hang’s wechat for the sake of an Lizi. ”
