“Although the long-haired girl was a little unwilling, she could only do as Xu Xiao said. She took out a few RMB notes from her bag and said, “That’s it, I really can’t give you any more! I advise you to quit while you’re ahead! Don’t be so Shameless!” ”

“If it weren’t for Xu Xiao’s position, she wouldn’t have taken out so much money! ”

“”I said, don’t you understand human language? I told you, it’s not about the money!”Lin Sha was completely impatient. She just wanted to quietly eat noodles with ye Zhuoan. ”

The long-haired girl stared at Lin Sha in disbelief. “What do you mean? Why Don’t you have any manners at all! Who are you calling human?”

“Ye Zao raised his eyebrows slightly, put down his phone, and looked up. “Didn’t you already know who you are?” ”

“The long-haired girl was so angry that her face turned green. She reached out her hand and slapped ye Zao’s face. “How dare you say that to me!”With Xu Xiao’s family, the long-haired girl usually bullied a lot of her classmates in school, so almost no one dared to provoke her. ”

She didn’t expect to be ridiculed and ridiculed by a poor guy today!

“Xu Xiao only watched this scene as if she was watching a good show. Li Qiang was just a chess piece in her hands. Li Qiang’s reputation in c university was very bad. He pretended to be bossy and bullied new students, and she was still the flawless young miss of the Xu family. ”

The mud could bring out the brightness of the moonlight.

Her bright moonlight needed Li Qiang’s contrast very much.

Li Qiang had practiced karate before. The girl today would probably be disfigured. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

It was good that she was disfigured.

She was so beautiful. One look and you could tell that she was not from a decent family.

Li Qiang could be considered to have eliminated evil for the people.

“Unexpectedly, the next second, Xu Xiao was directly stunned. ”

“Li Qiang, who had practiced karate, was directly pressed onto the table by Ye Zao. He was like a lamb waiting to be slaughtered, unable to move. ”

Oh My God!

This was too scary.

“”Didn’t your parents teach you how to Behave?”Ye Zao pressed Li Qiang’s hand. It looked like he was only pressing lightly, but only Li Qiang knew how much strength he had used. ”

It looked like it was always Li Qiang who bullied others. When did it become someone else’s turn to bully Li Qiang.

This kind of feeling was really not pleasant at all.

“At this moment, a waiter came over with a prepared cold face. “The two of you, here’s Your Lemonade.” ”

“Seeing this scene, the waiter was stunned for a moment, but he still placed the iced lemonade on the table. ”

“The next second, Ye Zhuo directly picked up the iced lemonade and placed it on Li Qiang’s head. ”

“”Since your parents didn’t teach you how to behave, then I’ll do it for you today. How about it? Are You Awake Now?” ”

“There were more than half of the ice cubes in the ice lemon water. At this moment, the ice cubes were rolling along the top of Li Qiang’s head and onto his chest clothes. Li Qiang only felt that he was about to die, he begged for mercy, “I’m awake, I’m awake! Please let me go!” ”

Only then did ye Zhuo unhurriedly release Li Qiang.

Li Qiang was drenched like a drowned rat. He was in a sorry state. How could he have the face to stay here any longer? He lowered his head and ran far away.

Only Xu Xiao was still standing there.

Ye Zao picked up the cup and curled his lips. “Why? Do you want to taste the Iced Lemonade?”

Xu Xiao gulped and immediately walked out.

“After the two of them left, Lin Sha looked at ye Zao and said, “Big Zao, you were so cool just now!” ”

“Ye Zao smiled and said, “Just so-so. Third in the world.” ”

“After saying that, Lin Shasha asked worriedly, “What if they go to the police?” ”

“After all, Ye Zao had just attacked her. ”

“Ye Zao did not care at all, as if the person just now was not her at all. “It’s okay, I was just defending myself.” ”

“Lin Shasha thought about it and agreed. After All, it was Lin Shasha and the others who attacked first. ”

“The next day, ye Zao went to the hospital with Cen Shaoqing to visit Xia Xiaoman as usual. ”

“Not long after the two arrived, there was another knock on the door. ”

“An Lizi walked over to open the door and said in surprise, “Uncle Jinshui, Aunt Lian! Why are you here?” ”

“”We just came to the capital to discuss business. We heard that your mother is going into labor, so we came over to take a look.”Zhou Yuelian smiled and said, “Has your mother given birth yet?” ”

“”Yes, yes.”An Lizi nodded repeatedly. “It’s a younger brother.” ”

“Zhou Yuelian said, “Then congratulations to your parents! Where are they?” ”

“They’re inside. Come with me.”

“This was the Super VIP ward that Lin Qingxuan had specially arranged for Xia Xiaoman. When they entered, they first entered the luxurious living room and then entered the ward. ”

“When the few of them came inside and saw Zhou Yuelian and Lin Jinshui, Ye Shu was also very surprised. ”
