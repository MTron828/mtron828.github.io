Ye Shu was so amused by Little White that she laughed out loud.

“Little White looked at Ye Shu. “Grandma, where did it come from? Can you give it to me as a pet!” ”

Little White had only recently sorted out its seniority.

“Ye Zao was its creator, which was equivalent to a father. If it was called Ye Shu, it would definitely call her grandma. ”

“What did you call me?”Ye Shu was stunned.

“Grandma!”Little White said.

Ye Shu touched her face. “Am I that Old?”

“Little White tilted its head and thought for a while. “But Big Zao is my Daddi! If I call you sister, wouldn’t the seniority be messed up, Grandma?” ”

“Ye Shu, who was forced to be a grandma:”...”she was speechless. ”

“”Grandma, Can You Give It to me?”Little White asked again. ”

“”Yes.”Ye Shu nodded. “Then from now on, you will be responsible for its food, daily life, and cleaning up its poop. You will teach it to go to the bathroom and not to urinate or defecate anywhere.” ”

“”Leave it to me!”Little White patted its chest and said proudly, “I used to pour the cat litter for that silly cat!” ”

“Speaking of silly cats, Little White’s mood became a little lower. “I miss silly cats so much!” ”

“Seeing little white like this, Ye Shu also sighed and continued, “Little White, why don’t you give it a name?” ”

“”Who?”Little White continued, “The demolition director?” ”

“Ye Shu smiled and said, “Why do you call it the demolition director?” ”

“”Oh my God! Grandma, don’t You Know?”Little White continued, “When you bought it, the owner didn’t introduce it to you? Husky’s alias is Husky, demolition class teacher. He didn’t let go, he’s a retard in the dog world!” ”

“As Little White said this, it played a video about the Husky to Ye Shu. ”

“Seeing the Husky’s crazy demolition behavior on the video, Ye Shu was stunned. After a long while, she said, “The owner only told me that it was a little naughty...” ”

No wonder the shop owner was so enthusiastic when he introduced the Husky!

It turned out that he couldn’t wait to sell this demolition class teacher.

“Little White continued, “Grandma, it’s so fat. Let’s call it Rollie, okay?” ”

“... Okay.”Ye Shu nodded.

“After successfully naming Rollie, Little White was filled with a sense of accomplishment. It picked up rollie and said, “Grandma, I’ll take Rollie out to play first! Don’t miss her!” ”

Ye Shu:”...”she didn’t want to be a grandma.

“When Lin Jincheng came back in the evening, little white kept calling him grandpa, which made Lin Jincheng dumbfounded. ”

“He wasn’t even fifty years old yet, how could he be a Grandpa? ”

Lin Ze was even more dumbfounded.

Because he had directly changed from an elder brother to an uncle.

The CEN Group’s base didn’t change much because of Professor Feng and director Ma’s departure.

“On the C country side, after director Ma attended the welcoming banquet, professor Feng joined in the intense work. ”

“Although the two of them had some secrets about the speed of light, they could not replicate the light-speed aircraft carrier! ”

“The aircraft carrier was a big project. Not only did it have the most advanced defense and attack systems, but it also incorporated nanotechnology to resist the cold and heat. These were technologies that Professor Feng and director Ma had never mastered. ”

“Professor Feng took out a design blueprint. “In three months, we will build the spaceship on the blueprint. In four months, we will be able to successfully land in Europe.” ”

“Hearing this, Dr. Cara frowned slightly. “Professor Feng, you are mistaken. My goal is to build an aircraft carrier!” ”

What could a spaceship do?

“In the vast universe, a spaceship could not even be considered a fly’s leg. ”

Any asteroid that flew over could destroy the spaceship.

“Professor Feng looked up at Dr. Cara. “Dr. Cara, building an aircraft carrier is not as simple as mastering the speed of light technology.” ”

Dr. Cara was stunned.

“Director Ma continued to smooth things over, “Dr. Cara, although we can’t build an aircraft carrier, the spaceship designed by Professor Feng and I can reach the speed of light. “There is no problem for us to successfully land on Europa. After we collect the energy on Europa and use the energy on Europa, it won’t be too late to study the aircraft carrier.” ”

“At this point, director ma paused and continued, “Europa is rich in energy. We will definitely be able to build an aircraft carrier that surpasses China!” ”

Europa was not like other planets where danger was everywhere. Europa was a very gentle planet. There was no need for an aircraft carrier to land on it.

“Hearing this, Dr. Cara looked up at the two of them. “Three months, right?” ”

“Yes.”Professor Feng nodded.

“”Okay,”Dr. Cara continued, “Then I’ll wait for you for three months! Oh right, I’ve also found a few outstanding disciples for you two.” ”

“Professor Feng smiled at Dr. Cara. “I’m sorry, I’m afraid I’ll have to disappoint you. Director Ma and I don’t accept disciples.” ”

Not accepting disciples?

Director Ma was stunned. He was about to say something when Professor Feng patted him lightly with his hand.

Director ma immediately understood and did not say anything else.

“Professor cara smiled and said, “Professor Feng, you may have misunderstood. I don’t have any other intentions. I just want to find a few disciples for the two of you. The two of you are the hope of our C Nation. We can’t let anything happen to the two of you.” ”

“”We appreciate your kindness, but there’s really no need,”professor Feng continued. ”

“”In that case, I won’t force you.”Professor Cara still had a smile on his face. ”

“After professor Cara left, director Ma looked at professor Feng and asked, “Why did you reject Cara? Isn’t it good to have two more people to help us?” ”

Professor Feng looked at director Ma. “Do you think Cara is really that kind-hearted?”

Director ma narrowed his eyes. “What do you mean?”

“Professor Feng nodded and continued, “The only use we have for C Nation now is the light speed technology. If other people learn it, what value do we have for them?” ”

“Hearing this, director Ma felt a chill run down his spine. He continued, “Professor Feng! Fortunately, you reacted quickly! If it were me today, I would have fallen into their trap!” ”

They had already been expelled from China.

“If they were to be abandoned by C Nation again, there would be no place for them to rest. ”

“Thinking of this, director Ma’s forehead was covered in layers of cold sweat. ”

“Professor Feng continued, “Don’t worry. As long as we control the light speed technology, they won’t dare to do anything to us! Our main task now is to quickly research the spaceship.” ”

Professor Feng couldn’t wait to land on Europa.

“”Okay.”Director ma nodded. At this moment, director Ma seemed to have thought of something and continued, “Oh right, did Auntie give you that?” ”

“Which one?”Professor Feng frowned.

“”Suyu!”Director ma said in disbelief, “She didn’t give it to you, right?” ” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“”Oh no!”Professor Feng’s face turned pale, “How could I have forgotten about this!” ”

..

Beijing.

In a villa.

“An old man with pale hair was sitting on a rocking chair, staring at the sky in a daze. ”

“The young girl behind him said, “Mom, is it really good for us to treat her like this? What if her family finds her?” ”

“A middle-aged woman who was munching on melon seeds said, “What’s there to be afraid of! Her daughter has long run away! She’s now a lonely old woman! Even if she dies, no one will care!” ”
