Chapter 1006: 226: The Truth of that year was ye Shu! 1

Translator: 549690339

Old Mrs. Cen was a bystander. She had witnessed everything that had happened that year.

“From the moment ye Langhua and Xi Muwen were together, she felt that the two of them were not compatible. ”

“Whether it was their family background, character, or talent, Xi Muwen was not worthy of ye Langhua. ”

“At that time, Ye Langhua was the most talented woman in glory world. ”

What about Xi Muwen?

Xi Muwen was nothing.

“If he was talented, then he had no talent. If he had character, then he had no character. ”

“Old Mrs. Cen admired ye Langhua very much back then. She even wanted to introduce ye Langhua to her nephew. Unfortunately, King Xiang was interested, but the goddess was heartless. ”

“Back then, Xi Muwen had caused ye Langhua to be so miserable. This time, would XI Muwen be so kind? ”

Definitely Not!

Especially after old Mrs. Cen had seen her for half a month.

There was nothing similar to ye Langhua between her brows for half a month.

“Moreover, Xi Muwen could do anything for his own ends. Old Mrs. Cen only felt that this was Xi Muwen’s conspiracy. ”

“Then.., old Mrs. Cen continued, “It’s said that a bystander sees the situation clearly, but a bystander sees it clearly! Little Lang Hua, think about it carefully. If it wasn’t for Xi Muwen back then, would you have ended up like this?” ”

“When she heard this, Aunt Lang was stunned. ” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Would Xi Muwen lie to her?

It shouldn’t be...

“After all, Little Half Moon was their common daughter. ”

“As a father, he couldn’t even deliberately mistake his own daughter! ”

“Moreover, she saw that Xi Muwen’s feelings for Little Half Moon didn’t seem fake. ”

If the little half a month at home was not really little half a month...

Then who was her little half a month?

“For a moment, ye Langhua fell into deep thought. ”

“Little Langhua!”Old Mrs. Cen waved her hand in front of ye Langhua’s eyes.

“Aunt Lang finally reacted and continued, “I understand, Aunt Tang. I’ll be more careful.” ”

Old Mrs. Cen nodded. “It’s good that you understand this principle.”

“”Old Lady.”At this moment, a gentle voice sounded in the air. ”

Ye Langhua looked up.

She saw an exquisite face.

Her skin was very white.

“She had a standard pair of phoenix eyes and her aura was very clean. She gave off the aura of sister Lin, which made people want to get close to her. ”

It was strange.

“It was their first time meeting, but ye Langhua had the illusion that they had known each other for a long time. ”

Could it be that they had met before?

“”Ah Shu!”Old Lady Cen raised her head to look at Ye Shu, and then at ye Langhua, “Little Langhua, let me introduce you. This is my granddaughter-in-law’s mother, Ah Shu. Ah Shu, this is Aunt Lang. Oh right, your Aunt Lang’s surname is also ye. Perhaps the two of you were a family five hundred years ago!” ”

“Ye Shu smiled and greeted, “Aunt Lang.” ”

So it was ye Zhuo’s mother!

No wonder she looked so familiar.

“Ye Lang hua smiled and said, “So it’s mother Zhuo Zhuo.” ”

“Old Lady Cen was stunned. “Little Lang Hua, you know my granddaughter-in-law too?” ”

Ye Shu was also a little surprised.

“Ye lang hua explained, “Shaoqing brought Zhuo Zhuo Zhuo to the restaurant a few times to eat.” ”

“This kid really knows how to dote on his wife!”Old Lady Cen said with a smile.

“Ye langhua continued, “The two of them are very compatible. Aunt Tang, just wait for your great-grandchild!” ”

“Then I’ll rely on your auspicious words.”Old Lady Cen could not close her mouth from smiling. It was as if she could already see her precious great-grandchild waving at her.

“After saying that, old lady cen continued, “Little Langhua, it’s not easy for us to bump into each other once. Why don’t we find a place to eat and chat while we’re at it?” ”

“Ye lang hua politely refused, “I still have something to do today. Why don’t we do it another time?” ”

Old Madam Cen nodded. “Then go do your thing! We’ll chat another time!”

“Okay.”Ye Lang Hua nodded.

“Old Madam Cen added, “Little Lang Hua, remember what I told you. Don’t make the same mistake again. After all, you’re already at this age. If you make one mistake after another, you won’t have the chance to start all over again.” ”

“Hearing this, ye Langhua nodded solemnly. ”

“Since they had already said this much, old Mrs. Cen didn’t say anything more. ”

There were some things that needed to be said.

“After ye Langhua left, Ye Shu looked at her back and said, “This aunt Lang should also be someone with a story.” ”

“Hearing this, Old Mrs. Cen turned to look at Ye Shu in surprise. “Ah Shu, you really didn’t see wrongly. Little Langhua really has a lot of stories!” ”

“What do you mean?”

Ye Shu had never been a person who liked to meddle in other people’s business.

“But for some reason, after seeing Aunt Lang, she had a strange feeling in her heart. She couldn’t wait to understand the story that happened to Aunt Lang. ”
