“”Grandma, don’t say that. You’re in good health!”Zheng Wanyin quickly squatted down and continued to comfort her. “You and Grandpa are so good. You’ll definitely live a long life.””

Zhou Zuolong stood at the side and wiped his tears.

“Xie wanqiu smiled and said, “It doesn’t matter whether I live a long life or not. The main thing is that your grandpa will live a long life.””

“Wanqiu!”Zhou Zuolong cried even louder.

“Xie wanqiu continued, “Old man, don’t just cry. Are You Listening to me?””

“”Wanqiu, tell me.”Zhou Zuolong took a deep breath to calm himself down. “I’m listening.””

“Xie wanqiu said, “I said, I want to find a good marriage for yinyin.””

Zhou Zuolong nodded. “You can make the decision on this matter. Yinyin is a good child. She will definitely listen to you.”

Xie wanqiu smiled and shook her head. “I can’t just nod my head on this matter. You have to agree to it.”

“”I agree, I agree! As long as it’s what you say, I agree! Which family did you show Yinyin?””

“”You know this person too,”Xie Wanqiu said.”

“Zhou zuolong reached out and scratched his hair. “I, I know him too?””

“Yes.”

“Who is it? Tell me.”

“Xie wanqiu continued, “This person is Shaoqing.”. Although Shaoqing and yinyin were cousins, they were not related by blood at all. Moreover, the fortune teller had told Yinyin that yinyin was a Phoenix’s life. In the entire capital, other than Shaoqing, who else could be worthy of a Phoenix’s life? “So, after looking around, I still think that these two are the most suitable. No one is more suitable than the two of them.””

Cen Shaoqing? !

Zhou Zuolong was stunned when he heard this.

He did not expect that Xie wanqiu would mention Cen Shaoqing.

He was a little surprised.

“After a while, Zhou zuolong continued, “But, but doesn’t Shaoqing have a girlfriend?””

“When she heard this, a sinister light flashed in Xie Wanqiu’s eyes.”

What did Zhou Zuolong Mean?

He did not want Zheng Wanyin to marry Cen Shaoqing?

“If she was not his biological daughter, then she was not his biological daughter. No matter what good things happened, Zhou Zuolong would never think of Zheng Wanyin.”

“Fortunately, her biological grandmother was not dead. Otherwise, he really could not imagine what kind of life Zheng Wanyin would have!”

“Xie wanqiu pretended to sigh and held Zhou Zuolong’s hand, “Old Man, I’ve seen Shaoqing’s girlfriend. The little girl’s surname is ye Zhuo.”. She does have a good reputation. It’s not an exaggeration to say that she’s devastatingly beautiful. It’s a pity that she’s born with a heart of a snake and a scorpion. She’s not worthy of our Shaoqing. If ye Zhuo had not deliberately framed yinyin, yinyin would already be in the management of the ABA! This kind of person even harmed her cousin. Do you think she’s a good person? “Xiangxiang is a real person. If ye Zhuo really marries into the CEN family, then the CEN family will have no place for Xiangxiang to speak!””

“Hearing this, Zhou Zuolong frowned. “Yinyin was expelled from the ABA because of her?”Zhou Zuolong had never known about this before.”

He only knew that Xie Wanqiu was angered by Zhou Xiang and was sent to the hospital.

“Xie wanqiu nodded, “I don’t know what dirty tricks ye Zao used to become the main assessment officer back then. Logically speaking, she was Shaoqing’s girlfriend and should have helped yinyin on the assessment ground, but what about her? “After all, she didn’t help yinyin. Instead, she deliberately gave yinyin a low score and let yinyin get an a. in the end, she even deliberately provoked yinyin and made yinyin slip up in front of the CEO... “Otherwise, yinyin wouldn’t have become like this “Do you think such a scourge can be married into the family?””

“Of course, such a scourge couldn’t be married into the family!”

Zhou Zuolong had always thought that Cen Shaoqing was a smart person.

“However, he did not expect Cen Shaoqing to be so muddle-headed!”

He was blind.

“After choosing for so many years, in the end, he actually chose such a person.”

“Zhou zuolong said angrily, “Why didn’t you guys tell me about this earlier?”” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Zheng wanyin said, “Grandfather, it’s not a big deal. Cousin, cousin, and sister-in-law have such a good relationship. Even if I told you, it wouldn’t be of any help. It’s better to avoid trouble. Moreover, I’ve never thought of marrying cousin. Please don’t listen to Grandmother.””

“Xie wanqiu grabbed Zheng Wanyin’s hand, “Old Man, did you see that? !”! Our Yinyin is like that. She has no heart and is kind-hearted. She doesn’t compete with the world. If it wasn’t because Shaoqing is also my grandson, I wouldn’t have let yinyin marry so far away! But Shaoqing is my grandson. I Can’t just watch him be harmed by ye Zao. Only yinyin is the most suitable for Shaoqing. yinyin has grown up in front of us since she was a child, we know her character best! Let Her marry Shaoqing, I’m also at ease!””
