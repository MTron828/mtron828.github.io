“Of course.”Ye Zhuo nodded slightly.

“”Miss Ye, thank you.”Jiang Xiaoyu was very excited. ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Just like them, just call my name.” ”

“”Great, Great Scorch?”Jiang Xiaoyu asked tentatively. ”

“Yes.”

“At this moment, Jiang Xiaoyu forgot all her troubles. ”

“Ye Zhuo continued, “Since we’re friends, can you tell me the truth? Who bullied you? Tell me, I’ll help you bully them back.” ”

“Jiang Xiaoyu raised her head and looked at Ye Zhuo. Her eyes were full of light as she continued, “Actually, it wasn’t anyone who bullied me...” ”

“Then, Jiang Xiaoyu told him about the difficulties the Jiang Financial Group had encountered. She came to Zhao Xueyin for help. ”

“However, she didn’t tell her about the ‘barking like a dog’incident. ”

She only told her briefly that Zhao Xueyin didn’t help her.

“Ye Zhuo raised his eyebrows slightly. According to her understanding of Jiang Xiaoyu, Jiang Xiaoyu wasn’t a person who liked to cry. ”

“Even if the Jiang Financial Group was in trouble, she wouldn’t cry to such an extent. ”

The way she looked just now clearly showed that she had been bullied.

“However, Ye Zhuo didn’t say it out loud. He just looked at Jiang Xiaoyu and said, “I’ll help you.” ”

“Hearing that, Jiang Xiaoyu looked up at Ye Zhuo with disbelief in her eyes. ”

She didn’t expect ye Zhuo to say that. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“You just returned to the Shunxi Financial Group. Isn’t this a little bad?”This was also the reason why Jiang Xiaoyu didn’t look for ye Zhuo.

Ye Zao was different from Zhao Xueyin.

“Zhao Xueyin was the acting chief of the Shunxi Financial Group. The Zhao family had been in the financial world for many years, and she had the ability to do so. ”

“Meanwhile, ye Zao had just returned to the Shunxi Financial Group. His foundation wasn’t stable, and his connections in the Shunxi Financial Group weren’t as good as Zhao Xueyin’s. If she rashly helped the Jiang Financial Group at this time, she would only drag herself down. ”

“”There’s nothing wrong with mutual benefits,”ye Zao said faintly. ”

Mutual benefits?

The Jiang Financial Group was now an empty shell.

That was why everyone refused to cooperate with them.

“However, ye Zao said that it was mutually beneficial. ”

This made Jiang Xiaoyu slightly stunned.

“At the same time, it also let Jiang Xiaoyu see a ray of hope. ”

“However, one couldn’t be too selfish. ”

One had to tell ye Zao the truth about the Jiang Financial Group.

One couldn’t let ye Zao get into trouble in order to help her.

“Jiang Xiaoyu continued, “Actually, the Jiang Financial Group is at the end of the road. Ye, Da Zao, I Know You Want to help me, but...” ”

“Ye Zao took a sip of tea and said, “Don’t worry, I never do business at a loss.” ”

Although she looked indifferent.

But her eyes were extremely determined.

It was a little cool.

“Somehow, Jiang Xiaoyu wasn’t afraid anymore. She had a feeling that ye Zao could definitely lead the Jiang Financial Group out of the difficult situation. ”

“”Great Zao Zao, Thank You!”Jiang Xiaoyu bowed deeply. ”

“”You’re welcome.”Ye Zao put down the cup and continued, “Help me make an appointment with Uncle Jiang. Tomorrow Morning at 11 o’clock, I’ll see you at the coffee shop.” ”

“Okay!”

...

On the other side.

In the conference room.

After learning that the meeting had been delayed for two hours.

Zhao Xueyin’s face turned green.

“She was the acting head of the Shunxi Financial Group, so why should ye Zhuo extend the meeting? ”

“Even if he wanted to extend the meeting, he should have approved her! ”

“Zhao Xueyin opened the folder and said with a sullen face, “Since President Ye isn’t free, then let her not come. Let the meeting continue!” ”

Did Ye Zhuo really think she was something?

The meeting couldn’t continue without her?

Disgusting!

Continue?

A troubled look flashed across Ally’s eyes.

She didn’t expect Zhao Xueyin to directly throw a tantrum.

“”Miss Zhao, I’m afraid we can’t continue, right?”Manager Liu closed the folder, “This meeting was originally chaired by President Ye to discuss Plan C. Now that President Ye isn’t here, how can we continue? Could it be that Miss Zhao can analyze plan C for us?” ”

Manager Liu was really good!

Ally looked in manager Liu’s direction.

Her words made Zhao Xueyin feel a little embarrassed.

Plan C belonged to Ye Zhuo.

How could she analyze it?

It was the other way around!

It was all the other way around!

Even a small department manager dared to challenge her now.

“If she didn’t show her might today, these people would really think that she was made of paper! ”

“Zhao Xueyin looked at manager Liu. “Liu Manshan, you don’t have to come tomorrow!” ”

Don’t have to come.

This sentence made manager Liu feel a little flustered.

“He was only a department manager, and Zhao Xueyin was indeed qualified to fire him. ”

PA —

The conference room door was pushed open at this time.

A clear voice came from the outside and the inside.

Every word and sentence was loud and clear.

“Who did you ask not to come tomorrow?”

“Hearing this, everyone turned to look. ”
