“Old Mrs. Cen sighed and held third aunt’s hand. “Now that things have happened, don’t think too much. Relax and take good care of the child! There is hope if there is a child!””

“Third aunt wiped her eyes. “If not for this child, I would have gone with my grandson and granddaughter-in-law long ago!””

“Not only did old Mrs. Cen feel uncomfortable listening to these words, but even the housekeeper felt very uncomfortable.” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Perhaps this was a case of a house falling through the night.

“Happy families were all similar, and unhappy families had their own misfortunes.”

“Soon, the car arrived at the door.”

The housekeeper got out of the car and opened the door.

“”Old Lady, please slow down.””

“After helping Old Mrs. Cen out of the car, old Mrs. Cen reached out to help the third aunt. “His third aunt, please slow down.””

The housekeeper went to carry Zhou Tianshun.

The five-year-old Zhou Tianshun was very thin and looked like he was malnourished. He did not carry much weight in his hands and was light as a feather. He was more than ten kilograms lighter than a child his age.

“Third aunt was helped out of the car by Old Mrs. Cen. She looked up at the magnificent Cen Manor that looked like a palace and widened her eyes. “Haifeng’s mother, this is where you live?””

“Yes.”Old Mrs. Cen nodded.

“The third aunt said in surprise, “Oh my God! This is even more luxurious than the Imperial Palace! Even the courtyard of our village chief’s house is not as good as this!””

The Cen family was so luxurious that the third aunt felt that the new year gift she brought was not presentable. She was even embarrassed to take it out.

“Fortunately, the housekeeper did not bring it over after carrying the snake skin bag into the car.”

“Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “If you like it, you can bring Little Tian Shun to play at home for a few more days! I like children the most, and you can also accompany me to chat! I’m here, and there’s not even anyone to chat with!””

“Third aunt smiled and said, “There’s still a lot of work waiting for me at home! We’ll go back the day after tomorrow.””

“Old Mrs. Cen continued, “There’s no rush, there’s no rush. I’ll have the housekeeper arrange for a driver to send you back! It’s not easy for you to come to the capital, how can you go back so quickly!””

“The two old ladies spoke as they walked, and soon they were inside the house.”

“Old Lady Cen took the initiative to introduce, “His third aunt, let me introduce you. This is Haifeng’s youngest son, Shaoqing. “This is Shaoqing’s wife, zhuoluo. This is my maternal niece! “Shaoqing, zhuoluo, this is third aunt. However, according to seniority, you have to call her third grandmother! Well, Lan Fang, you have to call her third grandmother too. Oh right, this is your third grandmother’s great-grandson, Tian Shun, Zhou Tian Shun!””

“Cen Shao Qing and ye Zhuo greeted them politely, “Hello, third grandmother.””

“Chen Lan Fang also greeted them, “Third grandmother.””

“Third aunt looked at them one by one. When she saw Cen Shao Qing.., she sighed and said, “This child is really handsome! He follows his father! He follows his father, and his wife is also handsome. They are really a pair from the heavens, a pair from the earth! Hai Feng’s mother, you’re really blessed!””

“”Hey, what blessing?”Old Mrs. Cen then instructed the servants to make tea. “Also, boil a cup of fresh milk for Little Tianshun! Bring some snacks for the children.””

“”Yes, Old Mrs. Cen.””

“Third aunt said embarrassedly, “Haifeng’s mother, you are too polite! We are not thirsty, and TIANSHUN does not eat.””

“”Drinking a cup of water is considered polite?”Old Mrs. Cen smiled and said, “Look at what you are saying!””

“The third aunt sized up the decorations in the house. The Cen family’s hall was really too luxurious. The carpet was soft and soft to step on. The floor was not paved, and the light shone on people. For a moment, the third aunt was very reserved, she did not know where to put her hands and feet.”

“Old Mrs. Cen pulled the third aunt to sit down together and said with a smile, “His third aunt, when you come to my place, it’s like coming to your own home. Don’t be afraid to let go. Quickly sit down.””

“Third aunt hurriedly stood up. “I’m dirty, so I don’t want to sit down!””

“Old Mrs. Cen said with a straight face, “Look at you, Old Lady. You’re deliberately saying these shabby words to me! Where are you dirty? Quickly sit down! Let us sisters have a good chat!””

“Even though third aunt’s clothes were a little shabby, her clothes were really not dirty, including Little Tianshun’s. Although his nose was a little runny, his clothes were still clean.”

“Very soon, the servants came over with boiled milk and snacks.”

“Little Tianshun was very reserved. Although he was a little greedy, he did not dare to eat it since zu zu did not say anything.”

“Old Granny Cen said, “Eat, child! These are the things that children like to eat.””
