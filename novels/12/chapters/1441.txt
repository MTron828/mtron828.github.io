“”Since he can be a 1st grader, I can be a 15th grader!”Professor Yue said indignantly, “I have devoted my life to the base, but he said that I should retire early and he let me retire early. He doesn’t care about my feelings at all!” ”

“”But he didn’t fire you. He just let you retire early!”! “Besides, I’ve heard that you’re also at fault in this matter. Cen Jiang’s surname is Cen after all, and he’s also the District Chief of Big C district. How can you beat him up just like that? ! “You only know that you were angry when ye Zhuo beat Tang Xue. Why Don’t you know how Master Five felt when you beat Cen Jiang Up?” ”

“In Wan Sheng’s opinion, Cen Shaoqing had more or less saved professor Yue some face. ”

At least he didn’t fire professor Yue directly.

“”In short, I have to ask him to bring ye Zao to apologize to me!”Professor Yue continued, “No matter what, my starting point is for the good of the base. Do you know how ye Zao stored the nuclear reactor? If the nuclear reactor leaks and causes a nuclear leak, who will bear the responsibility? Someone like ye Zao still wants to build an aircraft carrier? HMPH! In My Next Life!” ”

“Wan Sheng Sighed. “You’re just too strong!”At home, he was always the one who gave in to professor Yue. ”

“After saying that, wan sheng continued, “Haven’t you thought about what would happen if you offended Cen Wuye and he removed your name from the base?” ”

“Professor Yue was not worried about this at all. “Removing me from the base, I’m afraid that he has the heart and doesn’t have the guts to do so!” ”

Her research lab could not be replaced just like that.

“If Cen Shaoqing wanted the entire C zone to resume operations, he had to come and look for her. ”

“Quote, professor Yue continued, “Do you really think those people in the research lab are fools? If they are not fully confident, will they follow me? “Just wait. Before eight o’clock tomorrow morning, Cen Shaoqing will definitely bring ye Zhuo here to beg for forgiveness!” ”

“They had already gone on strike for an entire afternoon this afternoon. Although it was only an afternoon, the losses they had brought to the CEN base were not small. ”

“The current Cen Shaoqing would definitely be running around anxiously, thinking about how to apologize to her. ”

“”Are you that sure?”Wan Sheng continued, “But I think that CEN fifth master is not someone who will easily give in!”If the strike could threaten Cen Shaoqing, then wouldn’t the CEN base be in chaos? ”

“”This time, he can’t give in even if he doesn’t want to!”No one was willing to joke about their future and money. ”

Even Cen Shaoqing was not immune.

On the other side.

Shen Linlin went to find Sun Yu.

“”Sun Yu, we were too impulsive in the afternoon. I hope you can think about it. Are you really going to strike? “While there’s still time, hurry up and apologize to fifth master. Otherwise, by tomorrow morning, it will really be too late!” ”

“Sun Yu looked at Shen Linlin with a mocking look in her eyes, “Shen Linlin, do you really think I don’t know what you’re thinking? “Aren’t you just unhappy that I’m about to receive Master Five’s appreciation and be promoted! “Let me tell you, we’ve already broken up. There’s no more relationship. Please don’t come to me shamelessly in the future!” ”

“He knew that Shen Linlin would definitely regret it, but he did not expect her to come to him so quickly. ”

“Shen Linlin looked at Sun Yu, and her heart slowly turned cold. ”

It turned out that she was such a person in Sun Yu’s heart.

“Shen Linlin nodded. “Okay, I got it. Sun Yu, you better remember what you said today!” ”

Sun Yu snorted coldly.

Shen Linlin turned around and left.

“Soon, it was the next morning. ”

“In order to wait for Cen Shaoqing to come and beg her, professor Yue woke up early in the morning. ”

“Soon, it was eight o’clock, but Cen Shaoqing did not appear. ”

Professor Yue looked up at the clock on the wall and frowned slightly. Could it be that the clock was broken?

Something did not seem right.

“At the same time, at the CEN base. ”

“The A-2 members quietly moved into the research room in Area B, and Area B returned to normal operation. ”

“When she saw on the big screen that the research room in Area B was lit up, Tang Xue slightly curled her lips. ”

She was back.

Professor Yue was back.

“She didn’t expect Cen Shaoqing to act so quickly. In just one night, he had invited professor Yue back. ”

Tang Xue immediately ran to Area B and soon arrived at the research room. She stretched out her hand and knocked on the door.

The door opened.

“However, the person who opened the door was an unfamiliar face that Tang Xue did not recognize. ”

Tang Xue was stunned. “You’re New Here? I’m Looking for Professor Yue!”

“We don’t have professor Yue here.”
