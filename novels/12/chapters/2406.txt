Translator: 549690339

“Mario! Let Go of Me!”Kading struggled with all his might. “I’m not a spy! You’ll definitely regret it if you do this!” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Mario’s back was facing kading, and he didn’t say a word. ”

Regret?

The thing he regretted the most right now was sending a single cell sample of the exotic beast to China.

Kading was quickly brought out of the laboratory.

“William looked in the direction where kading had disappeared and frowned slightly. “Mario, isn’t it a little too much for us to do this...”. ”

“Although Kading had always opposed this experiment, his motive was still for the good of lzhou. ”

“Why? Do you want to plead on his behalf?”Mario turned to look at William.

“William continued, “After all, Kading is an elder of the base. I’m afraid that what you do will cause public outrage.” ”

“We have the perpetual motion machine now. What’s there to be afraid of?”Mario retorted.

“In such a huge base, could it be that there was still someone who could create a second perpetual motion machine? ”

“As long as there wasn’t one, they could only endure it no matter how displeased they were! ”

William took a look at Mario and did not say a word. The look in his eyes was a little complicated.

He had a feeling that Mario had changed a lot.

“Hopefully, these were all good changes! ”

“Mario continued, “I’ll be out for a while. Take care of the perpetual motion machine.” ”

“Okay.”William nodded.

“After leaving the laboratory, Mario went over to the exotic beast’s side. ”

“At first, Mario had felt that the exotic beast was a little strange. ”

“But now, Mario didn’t feel that the exotic beast was strange at all. ”

“Instead, he felt very amiable. ”

“Lucy! Thank you!”

“To Mario, the exotic beast was his bole. ”

“If not for the exotic beast, he wouldn’t be where he was now. ”

The exotic beast seemed to be responding to Mario as it growled softly.

“Mario continued, “I still want to create an aircraft carrier that surpasses China, can I?” ”

“Now, a perpetual motion machine was no longer enough for Mario. ”

The strange beast seemed to understand what Mario was saying as it nodded.

“Seeing this, Mario was very excited as he continued, “Can I really have an aircraft carrier that surpasses China?” ”

The strange beast nodded once again.

Mario was so excited that he almost jumped up from the ground.

“Soon, L continent would become an existence that surpasses the entire world. ”

Mario was too excited. He did not notice the abnormal expression in the strange beast’s eyes at all.

Over here.

Kading was locked up in a small black room.

“The small black room was a completely enclosed space. No sound could be heard, and no light could be seen. ”

“Kading squatted in a corner, his mind constantly studying the strange behavior of the strange beast. ”

The current him couldn’t waste even the slightest bit of time.

Even if he was locked up in a small black room.

Mario announced the news of the perpetual motion machine to the world overnight.

Perpetual Motion Machine!

No one had expected that lzhou would actually develop a perpetual motion machine.

“For a moment, the international department was in an uproar. ”

Could it be that a second China was really going to appear out of nowhere?

“Before this, those neighboring countries that wanted to draw a line between themselves and Lzhou immediately withdrew their defense systems and approached Lzhou with a straight face to ask for peace. ”

“In just two days, over a dozen countries had signed cooperation agreements with LZHOU. ”

Mario had turned from a plague that everyone kept a distance from to a hot commodity.

“When some of the people who had already left Lzhou heard the news, they began to regret it and set out on a journey back to their country. ”

Jerry’s mother was also one of those who regretted it.

“Jerry’s mother, Susan, was originally unwilling to leave the place where she had been born and raised. Now that lzhou had announced such a big news, she began to pack her things and prepare to go back. ”

“Seeing this, Irene immediately went to inform Jerry. ”

“Hearing this, Jerry immediately rushed home to stop his mother. ”

“”Mom, you can’t go back now!” ”

“Although Jerry didn’t know what the exotic beasts would turn into in the end, he had a feeling that returning to L continent at this time would be a decision they would regret for the rest of their lives. ”

Susan looked at Jerry. “But I don’t like this place! I didn’t like it from the beginning!”

Feelings had no boundaries.

“When one was old, they naturally wished to stay in their homeland. ”

“Jerry continued, “Mom, I know what you mean. Please bear with it. Everything is just a facade now. No one knows what will happen in the end! Staying here is a hundred times safer than staying in L continent!” ”

“”Dr. Mario has already developed a perpetual motion machine. I don’t know what you’re afraid of!”Susan continued, “It’s fine if you don’t go back. I have to go back!” ”

“In Susan’s eyes, her son Jerry was simply unreasonable! ”

“”Mom, calm down.”Jerry was very anxious. “If you really go back, there’s no turning back.” ”
