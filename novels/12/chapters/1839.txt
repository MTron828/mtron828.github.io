Bang.

Seeing this scene.

The eight clan leaders directly fell onto the stool behind them.

It was ye Han.

It was indeed ye Han.

“Even if he wanted to defend ye Han, he had no strength to refute at this moment. ”

“The EMEI Thorn could be said to be a coincidence, but how could ye Zhuo’s portable system explain it? ”

“Other than ye Han, no one else could operate ye Zhuo’s portable system. ”

The only person who could operate it was none other than ye Han.

The other six clan leaders also had faces full of disbelief.

“If they hadn’t seen it with their own eyes, none of them would have believed that ye Han would actually betray ye Zhuo. ”

“”So it seems that Miss Ye’s death is definitely related to Ye Han,”said the five clan leaders. ”

“The three clan leaders and the four clan leaders nodded. “Old Five is right. If there wasn’t a traitor, how could such an accident happen to someone as cautious as Miss Ye?” ”

Ye Zhuo died in a failed chemical experiment.

“At that time, there were a total of seven people in the laboratory. ”

None of them were spared.

“Coincidentally, Ye Han was not at the base on the day of the incident. ”

“After the incident, Ye Han did not appear until ye Zhuo’s memorial service. ”

“At first, everyone thought that ye Han could not bear the blow after hearing this news and sought his own death. ”

“After all, everyone had witnessed the deep affection between ye Zhuo and ye Han. ”

Ye Han following ye Zhuo could also be understood by others.

Who would have thought.

Who would have thought that ye Han would actually betray ye Zhuo.

“”You really know a person’s face but not his heart!”The six clan leaders and seven clan leaders frowned, “If I knew that Ye Han was this kind of person, Miss Ye shouldn’t have saved him in the first place!” ”

“”Don’t define it so early.”The second clan leader who hadn’t spoken all this time stood out and said, “Looks are born from the heart. In my opinion, Ye Han isn’t that kind of treacherous villain. There must be a misunderstanding!” ”

The second clan leader had once come into contact with Ye Han in private.

“Ye Han was gentle and refined, and his every move exuded the aura of a gentleman. He was definitely not that kind of person! ”

The second clan leader had once wanted to introduce his daughter to Ye Han.

And the second clan leader had indeed always treated ye Han as his future son-in-law. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“After saying that.., the second clan leader continued, “On the other hand, that Qiu di has been coveting Miss Ye’s identity and status for a long time. As soon as Miss Ye had an accident, she couldn’t wait to get the information on the trans-star case. Even if you think with your toes, you would know that there must be something wrong with her!” ”

“”Ye Han’s ability is only below Miss Ye’s. Do you think that other than being willing, who else can force ye Han?”The third clan leader asked. ”

The second clan leader was stunned.

What the third clan leader said wasn’t without reason.

Ye Han was taught by Ye Zhuo.

“In the entire Chang Yue country, besides Ye Zhuo, Ye Han’s ability wasn’t below anyone else’s. No one could threaten ye Han at all. ”

“The eight clan leaders narrowed their eyes. “Could it be that Qiu di has grasped some secret of Ye Han? She used a secret to threaten ye Han, so ye Han had no choice but to do this?” ”

“These words reminded the second clan leader, “Ye Han has always been by Miss Ye’s side. Even if there is some secret, it must be related to Miss Ye.” ”

But what secret could ye Zhuo have that could make Qiu di threaten ye Han?

This was simply nonsense!

“The few clan leaders were now very conflicted. They felt that ye Han had betrayed ye Zao, but they were also unwilling to believe this fact. ”

“Ye Han’s betrayal of Ye Zao was not only a fatal blow to ye Zao, but to them, it was also a serious blow! ”

“Right at this moment, the seventh clan leader seemed to have discovered something. He clicked on the screen and paused the surveillance screen. ”

“Look here.”

“What’s going on here?”

“The seventh clan leader pointed at Ye Han’s face and said, “When the first clan leader mentioned Miss Ye, Ye Han’s expression was clearly not right. “Moreover, Ye Han has been emphasizing that his surname is Wu. Do you guys think that Ye Han has lost his memory? “Or rather, it’s autumn flute who changed ye Han’s memory.” ”

“Hearing this, the second clan leader nodded, “What seventh brother said makes sense. Qiu Di has always been sinister and cunning. It’s not surprising that she would do such a thing.” ”

“”But in the entire Chang Yue country, other than Miss Ye, who else has the ability to change his memory?”The fifth clan leader asked. ”

“Hearing this, the air instantly became quiet. ”

That’s right.

“If there were problems with Ye Han’s memory, then who was the mastermind behind the scenes? ”

“First of all, Qiu di definitely did not have this ability. ”

“If someone did not change ye Han’s memory, then it meant that he had really defected! ”

All the signs that he had shown were all fake.
