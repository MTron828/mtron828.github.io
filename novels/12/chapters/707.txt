After a long while.

About five minutes.

“Cen Shaoqing moved his lips away, and his breath stopped by Ye Zao’s ear unsteadily. “Leader, are you satisfied?” ”

“Can you not talk?”Ye Zao had never experienced this in his previous life and this life.

This was the first time.

Yet CEN Shaoqing still had to ask.

Ye Zao had never known.

“Cen Shaoqing, who was cold and abstinent, had such a side to him. ”

He was simply a hooligan!

Who would believe this?

Cen Shaoqing chuckled and wrapped ye Zao in his coat.

“Ye Zao was wrapped in this person’s embrace, tightly surrounded by a layer of warmth. Every breath he took was filled with the scent of his own male hormones. ”

...

“Soon, it was the second half of the night. ”

Xi Weiyue once again came to ye Langhua’s courtyard. “Aunty.”

“What’s Wrong?”Ye Langhua’s voice came from inside.

“”Aunty, are you hungry? I’ve asked the kitchen to make bird’s nest stew. Do you want to drink some?” ”

“Ye langhua continued, “No need, I’m not hungry. Weiyue, you can go back.” ”

“Xi Weiyue’s expression did not change. She said gently, “Aunty, I’ve already brought it over. You should at least drink a little, right?” ”

“At this moment, the door opened from the inside. ”

Creak —

“Seeing this, Xi Weiyue’s eyes lit up and she immediately walked forward. “Aunt.” ”

Ye Langhua did not have much of a smile on his face. “Come in.”

“Okay.”

Xi Weiyue carried the bird’s nest and walked in with ye Langhua.

Ye Langhua’s room was very clean.

“However, Xi Weiyue kept feeling that this place was eerily gloomy, just like ye Langhua’s entire person. He kept a straight face all year round, making people look very depressed. ”

“”Auntie, please drink the bird’s nest while it’s hot.”Xi Weiyue handed the bird’s Nest to ye Langhua. ”

Ye Langhua reached out to take the bird’s nest.

“After taking a sip, he put it down. ”

“XI weiyue continued, “Auntie, are you thinking about Sister Half Moon again?” ”

Ye Langhua did not say anything.

Of course.

How could she not think about it.

It was a piece of meat that had fallen from her pregnancy of ten months.

“XI weiyue continued, “Auntie, I believe that Sister Half Moon is living a very happy life now. She definitely doesn’t want you to worry about her.” ”

“Are you saying that my little half moon is still alive?”Ye Langhua seemed to have grabbed onto a life-saving straw as she looked at Xi Weiyue.

“Xi Weiyue nodded. “Of course, aunt. A good person will be rewarded. You’ve done so many good things. Sister Half Moon will definitely be fine.” ”

Fine?

How could she be fine.

It had been more than 30 years.

That Little Half Moon must have died a long time ago.

“Ye Langhua saw redemption in Xi Weiyue’s words. “That’s right, that’s right. Weiyue, you’re right. My little half-moon is definitely fine. She’s definitely fine.” ”

“”That’s right, Auntie. So you don’t have to worry at all.”XI weiyue continued, “Although sister half-moon can’t be found, you still have me. You can treat me as your biological daughter. If you have anything to say or have any worries, you can tell me. I’ve watched you grow up. In My Heart, you’re just like my biological mother.” ”

Xi Weiyue spoke with sincerity.

It was as if she really treated ye Langhua as her own mother.

“Ye Langhua nodded. Looking at Xi Weiyue’s face, she could not help but shed tears. ”

If only her little half moon was still around.

She would definitely be as beautiful as XI Weiyue.

“Xi Weiyue looked at ye Langhua and narrowed her eyes. She then said, “Aunt, I plan to join the Shunxi Financial Group.” ”

The Shunxi Financial Group was the most mysterious financial group in the financial world.

It was made up of the five big families in the world.

It was the second largest financial group in the world.

“Ye Langhua did not have any special expression on her face. She just nodded and said, “Okay.” ” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Okay?

Xi Weiyue looked at ye Langhua from the corner of her eyes.

“Did this crazy woman, Ye Langhua, really not understand, or was she pretending not to understand? ”

Was the Shunxi Financial Group that easy to join?

That was the second largest financial group in the world!

Could it be that...

Ye Langhua really had nothing to do with the Shunxi Financial Group?

Was everything just their conjecture?

“Xi Weiyue narrowed her eyes and continued, “Aunt, the Shunxi Financial Group has a very high threshold. It’s not easy for ordinary people to enter. Aunt, you’re very knowledgeable. Is there anything you want to tell me?” ”

Ye Langhua shook her head and her gaze was calm. “I don’t know much about the Shunxi financial group either.”

Don’t Know?

Was it true that she really didn’t know?

Ye Langhua was not an ordinary person when she was young.

She was talented and versatile.

“Moreover, it was rumored that one of the five big families of the Shunxi Financial Group was the ye family. ”

This ye family had nothing to do with Ye Langhua?

“Xi Weiyue did not continue the topic and picked up the bird’s nest on the table. “Auntie, this bird’s nest should be drunk while it’s hot.” ”
