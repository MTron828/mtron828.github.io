“If he were to accept the items from the Qian family at this time, it would inevitably attract the attention of others. Father Zhao directly rejected him, “I have received the intention, but I can not accept the items.” ”

Who Was Liu Sanniang?

“She could see through Father Zhao’s thoughts with a glance, she smiled and said, “I have already brought it with me. Why do you still want me to take it back?”? “Besides, the Qian family’s patriarch said that it doesn’t matter even if we don’t become in-laws. We can just treat it as making friends!”! “Marriage is fated by Heaven. If Miss Zhao doesn’t agree, we can’t force her to do it.” ”

“Liu Sanniang’s words were extremely beautiful. Not only did she give Father Zhao face, but she also gave him something that he could accept with ease. She even labeled him as a ‘good father’. ”

“Father Zhao said, “Since Patriarch Qian has already said so much, then I will respectfully comply. Please help me thank Patriarch Qian and treat him to a drink another day.” ”

“”Sure, sure.”Liu Sanniang nodded with a smile and continued, “Then when do you think you can give an answer to Miss Zhao?” ”

“Father Zhao hesitated for a moment. “Mrs. Liu, just as you said, no one else can make the decision for this marriage. As for the specifics, it depends on my daughter’s opinion.” ”

“Speaking up to this point, Father Zhao paused before continuing, “Why don’t we arrange for these two young people to meet first?” ”

“If they could agree to meet, then this matter was almost certain. ”

“After all, it wasn’t like Father Zhao didn’t know who Qian Xiaochuan was. ”

“Liu Sanniang saw through it and said, “Then I’ll go back and discuss it with the Qian family head. After that, can I contact you by phone?” ”

“Sure.”Father Zhao nodded.

“Liu Sanniang stood up from her chair. “Mr. Zhao, I Won’t disturb you anymore. Patriarch Qian is still waiting for my news.” ”

“Okay.”Father Zhao looked at the butler beside him. “Help me send Madam Liu Off.”

“The Butler immediately made a ‘please’gesture. “Madam Liu, please.” ”

Liu Sanniang nodded and turned to walk out of the door.

“After Liu Sanniang left, Father Zhao looked at the servant. “Where’s the young miss?” ”

“The young miss went to the consortium.”

“To the consortium? Why did she go to the consortium?”Father Zhao’s expression was very ugly. “Is she embarrassed? !”

The servant did not dare to answer.

“Father Zhao continued, “Call her and tell her to come back immediately.” ” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Okay.”The servant nodded and turned to call Zhao Xueyin.

On the other side.

Liu Sanniang hurried to the Qian family and told Qian Dafu Father Zhao’s answer.

“Hearing Father Zhao agree to let the two young men meet first, Qian dafu smiled and said, “Mrs. Liu, it’s all thanks to you! No wonder everyone says you’re the Living Moon Elder!” ”

“Speaking up to this point, Father Zhao took out a thick red packet. “This is the first red packet. After the matter is settled, there will be a second red packet.” ”

“Liu Sanniang took the red packet with both hands and said with a smile, “Then, when do you think we should arrange for the couple to meet?” ”

“”Let’s meet tomorrow instead of another day! Tomorrow Morning at ten o’clock, I will personally bring Xiaochuan to the Zhao family.” ”

“”Okay, okay.”Liu Sanniang nodded and said, “Then I will immediately call old Mister Zhao back.” ”

“”Thank you for your trouble,”Qian Dafu said. ”

“Liu Sanniang smiled and said, “Look at what you’re saying. This is what I should do. Patriarch Qian, if there’s nothing else, I’ll leave first. Let’s contact each other by phone tomorrow.” ”

“Okay.”Qian Dafu got up and sent Liu Sanniang out of the door.

“Just as he sent Liu Sanniang away, Mrs. Qian came back from playing mahjong. “Dafu, who came just now? Why Do I look like matchmaker Liu?” ”

“That’s right.”Qian Dafu nodded. “It’s her.”

“Why is she here?”To introduce someone to Qian Dafu?

“Thinking of this, Mrs. Qian felt a sense of crisis in her heart. ”

“Qian dafu continued, “Our Little Chuan isn’t young anymore. I asked her to find a good girl for him.” ”

“Hearing this, Mrs. Qian heaved a sigh of relief and continued, “You’re really thoughtful. Who did matchmaker Liu introduce?” ”

“”The daughter of the Zhao family,”answered Qian Dafu. ”

The daughter of the Zhao Family?

“Mrs. Qian was stunned for a moment before she said, “Zhao Zhenfei’s daughter, Zhao Xueyin?” ”

“”Yes, that’s her,”said Qian Dafu. ”

“Her?”Mrs. Qian’s eyes were filled with ridicule. “She’s a lunatic. How could she be worthy of my son!”

Who in the industry did not know that Zhao Xueyin was mentally ill?

Mrs. Qian couldn’t afford to lose face!

“Qian Dafu glanced at Mrs. Qian. “Women’s opinions! Long hair, short knowledge!” ”
