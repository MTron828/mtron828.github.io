“Chapter 2043: 426: too late to regret, Election Day! 7”

“Okay.”Guangxing nodded.

“After saying that, Guangxing looked at ye Zhuo and asked carefully, “Grandma, can I really treat this place as my home?” ”

“”Yes.”Ye Zhuo said very seriously, “If you don’t treat this place as your home, I will be angry!” ”

“Upon hearing this, Guangxing’s expression immediately changed. He immediately said, “Grandma, don’t be angry. I will treat this place as my own home from now on!” ”

“After saying that, he quickly ran over to get the nutrient solution. ”

“Yi ling smiled and said, “This guangxing, why is he like a Child?” ”

“Ye Zhuo said, “He was just a child to begin with.” ”

“When he was locked in the basement, Guangxing was only 15 years old. ”

“Although five years had passed, to Guang Xing, these five years were no different from a pause. ”

Wasn’t 15 years old just a child?

“Yi Ling continued: “Oh right, Da Zao Zao, why hasn’t ye Xiao Han come to look for you?” ”

“Ye Han had taken the antidote for quite some time, logically speaking, he should have recovered his memories by now. ”

“There was no movement at all, making Yi Ling worried. ”

“Ye Zhuo’s expression was indifferent, “Don’t worry, we will be able to see the sun soon.” ”

“”Great burning, is ye Xiao Han really alright?”Yi Ling asked. ”

“Ye Zhuo said, “Don’t worry, he will be fine.” ”

“Seeing ye Zhuo’s calmness, Yi Ling did not say anything else. ”

Ye Zhuo’s time was peaceful.

But the sixth clan leader’s side wasn’t so peaceful.

“When the sixth clan leader stepped into the basement and saw the empty iron cage, he even thought that he was hallucinating. ”

Where was Guang Xing!

Where did Guang Xing Go!

“”Xing ‘er! Xing ‘er!”The sixth clan leader shouted, “Xing ‘er, where are you!” ”

Only the echo in the basement responded to him.

“However, the six clan leaders still couldn’t speak. He announced to the public that Guang Xing had entered the military academy. If he were to search for Guang Xing in such a high-profile manner, wouldn’t that be a disguised admission that Guang Xing didn’t go to the military academy at all and that the Guang family had gone crazy? ”

“Therefore, he could only keep this matter to himself and secretly search for him. He absolutely couldn’t let anyone discover any clues. ”

“The Guang family was already a prominent family. Who knew how many families were waiting for him to make a mistake outside, waiting to see them become a laughingstock! ”

“The sixth clan leader immediately contacted his trusted aide, Li Rongfa. ”

“Very soon, Li Rongfa arrived at the basement. ”

“”Sixth clan leader, what important matter do you have for me?” ”

“The sixth clan leader frowned, “Xing ‘er, Xing ‘er has disappeared.” ”

“Hearing this, Li Rongfa raised his head in shock, “Little Young Master has disappeared? When did this happen?” ”

“The sixth clan leader shook his head, “I came to see him five days ago.”By the time he came back, the basement was already in this state. ”

“Li RONGFA continued, “Have you checked the surveillance cameras?” ”

“The surveillance cameras did not capture any meaningful scenes.”The sixth clan leader said.

“Li Rongfa scratched his head, “Sixth clan leader, don’t be anxious. I will immediately arrange for people to look for him. I believe that we will definitely find the young master.” ”

“The sixth patriarch nodded and continued, “If we find him, then...”speaking up to this point, the sixth patriarch made a ‘slit his throat’gesture. ”

“Rather than letting Guang Xing go out and embarrass himself, it would be better to just let him disappear from this world. ”

The sixth patriarch was already beginning to regret why he did not kill Guang Xing at that time.

“If he could have hardened his heart five years ago, things would not have become like this. ”

“Thinking of this, the sixth clan leader sighed. ”

“Seeing this, Li Rongfa hesitated for a moment before continuing, “Sixth clan leader, the young master is your only son after all, you...” ”

“The sixth clan leader’s face was full of pain, “How could I not know that he is my only son? Do you think that my heart is not uncomfortable at all? But things have already come to this point, in order to protect the Guang family’s reputation, I can only use this last resort!” ”

“He was already so old. He did not want to experience the pain of losing his only son. But now, he had no other choice. ”

But he had to do it!

“After Li Rongfa dealt with Guang Xing, he would immediately issue an obituary saying that Guang Xing had died on the battlefield. ”

“This way, not only could he protect the Guang family’s reputation, but he could also explain Guang Xing’s death. It was killing two birds with one stone. ”

“Li Rong fa sighed, “Alright, since you’ve already decided, sixth clan leader, I’ll be leaving first.” ”

Sixth clan leader nodded. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Li Rong Fa turned around and left.

“Just as Li Rong FA was about to leave the basement, sixth clan leader suddenly spoke, “Wait a moment.” ”

“Do you have any other orders?”Li Rong Fa stopped in his tracks and turned to look at sixth clan leader.

“The sixth clan leader continued: “No matter what, Xing ‘er and I are father and son. You, you leave his corpse intact and let him leave with dignity.” ”

This was the last thing the sixth clan leader could give to Guangxing as a father.

“He hoped that in the next life, Guangxing would be a normal person and not have to suffer like this again. ”

“”Yes.”Li RONGFA nodded, “Don’t worry, I will give young master dignity.” ”

“You go.”The sixth clan leader waved his hand.

Li Rong Fa turned around and left.

“The sixth clan leader stood on the spot, covering his face and crying bitterly, “Xing ‘er! Xing ‘er! It’s Daddy who has let you down! If you want to blame, blame daddy! I hope that you can be a healthy person in your next life, and we can still be father and Son!” ”

The sealed basement was filled with the cries of the sixth clan leader.

This voice made people somewhat moved.

“Li Rongfa’s footsteps also slowed down, but soon, he returned to his normal speed. ”

Time passed very quickly.

“In the blink of an eye, it was the day of the general election ”

“All the ruling families of Changyue were gathered on the first floor, guessing who the new female monarch of Changyue was. ”

“I heard that the female monarch chosen by the eight great clans is Qiu Di!”

“Qiu Di?”A white-bearded old man frowned slightly. “How come I’ve never heard of this name before?”

“Hearing this, that person said, “Don’t say that you’ve never heard of it! I’ve never heard of it either! But since it’s chosen by the eight great clans, there shouldn’t be any problems.” ”

The eight great clans were the most loyal subordinates of Ye Zhuo.

The female monarch chosen by them together couldn’t be wrong.

“At this moment, another person at the side slowly spoke, “Didn’t a prophet predict three hundred years ago that a person with the surname Qiu would not be able to become the country’s ruler? Now that the eight great clans have chosen autumn flute, aren’t they afraid of facing the calamity of extermination?” ”

“When these words were said, everyone looked at each other in dismay. They could see the puzzlement in each other’s eyes. ”

“”If I had to say, this matriarch should be the successor. Miss ye should be the one to personally announce it! What’s with the inexplicable change of person?” ”

“Other than the insiders, no one else knew about the news of ye Zhuo’s accident. When the eight great clans announced the news to the public, they announced that Ye Zhuo was going to retire and hand over the position of female sovereign to Qiu Di. ”

“”Brother Yu, what you said makes sense! None of us are willing to submit to Miss Ye! What’s with this inexplicable person surnamed Qiu?” ”

“Hearing this, the others nodded. ”

“The white-bearded elder continued, “I don’t know if you’ve heard the news, but it says that miss ye has already died.” ”
